00:07:07 <Thatcher[m]> <strcat[m] "eSIM is a SIM to let you connect"> Will there be any security, privacy or any other kind of advantage of using eSIM over SIM?
00:07:21 <strcat[m]> no
00:07:40 <strcat[m]> the advantage is you don't need a physical SIM
00:07:50 <strcat[m]> it runs their secure element code in a dedicated eSIM secure element on the SoC
00:08:09 <strcat[m]> it has no privacy, security or other advantages
00:08:21 <Thatcher[m]> Thanks
00:08:29 <strcat[m]> the secure element is to secure the carrier's network not the user
00:08:39 <strcat[m]> and I mean, to secure it from free usage
00:14:43 <b1101> are there checksums for the ota update zips?
00:19:42 <strcat[m]> b1101: no, they're signed
00:20:12 <strcat[m]> so, there's a cryptographic hash signed by the signing algorithm, sure
00:20:36 <b1101> ok cool. so if ever the file is bad, it will know before it flashes
00:20:51 <strcat[m]> the ota update zips are signed
00:21:05 <strcat[m]> the update client and recovery perform signature verification and downgrade protectiobn
00:21:08 <strcat[m]>  * the update client and recovery perform signature verification and downgrade protection
00:21:15 <strcat[m]> this is covered in our site's docs
00:21:21 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
00:21:29 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
00:22:00 <strcat[m]> there isn't a separate signature because it's part of the zip file format of updates
00:22:10 <strcat[m]> it's built-in
00:22:19 <strcat[m]> if you really want to verify it manually for some reason you can do that
01:27:24 <thetranstocommie> hey so i need to use the Instagram web app for some stuff, but the 2 factor authentication text doesn't come through on graphene. other texts work, just not whatever that number is.
01:30:48 <rny> thetranstocommie: this does not sound like a problem related to the os
01:31:17 <thetranstocommie> it worked on calyxos earlier today on the same device
01:31:49 <rny> try 2FA with other apps
01:32:46 <thetranstocommie> 2fa via SMS worked with signal
01:33:33 <rny> so the problem is with instagram?
01:33:53 <rny> we dont do anything unusual w.r.t sms
01:34:17 <rny> as an aside, 2fa via sms is insecure anyways
01:34:26 <rny> you should use totp-2fa
01:35:40 <thetranstocommie> ik but idrc about my Instagram
01:35:41 <thetranstocommie> I've got like 2 ppl I need to use it with messaging for
01:36:03 <thetranstocommie> and like I said, it worked on calyxos earlier today. had to get the text from them when I wanted to sign in on my computers browser.
01:36:56 <thetranstocommie> figured it was maybe an automatic SMS filter or something I just didn't know how to disable
01:37:15 <pnrxa[m]1> Slightly unrelated but there's an fdroid app called Barinsta which might be nicer than the web app. Won't help your 2fa SMS issue though. For Instagram messaging I use the Matrix bridge
01:37:42 <thetranstocommie> problem with barinsta is it doesn't get DM push notifications
01:38:00 <thetranstocommie> there's a matrix bridge o shit
01:38:30 <M3> Is it possible to totally degoogle a phone's preinstalled rom, or is it necessary to wipe it and install a rom to the level of graphene that lacks any Google's presence to begin with?  All I've found is conflicting information on this.  It ranges from, all you have to do is just remove or disable anything clearly identifiable as Google and
01:38:31 <M3> they're effectively purged, to it's impossible because Google is too deeply embedded in the ROM with parts that can't be truly disabled or through unsuspecting Google code.  To be fair, I saw a news article about how choose to disable Google doesn't always fully work.  For the average nobody whose bigger concern is privacy rather than security,
01:38:31 <M3> is degoogling a phone's pre-bundled ROM sufficient to protect their privacy, or are ROMs on the level of graphene necessary to ensure it.
01:40:29 <mike_of_earth> You can't degoogle the pre-installed OS completely to my knowledge.
01:41:03 <thetranstocommie> you can get kinda close-ish, but its always gonna phone home at least a bit.
01:41:28 <mike_of_earth> You basically have Graphene or CalyxOS
01:41:59 <pnrxa[m]1> the trans to commie pipeline: matrix bridges are awesome but you have to host your own matrix server I think
01:42:04 <mike_of_earth> Or there are other ROMs out there depending on your device. Lineage is AOSP to start with IIRC
01:42:50 <pnrxa[m]1> the trans to commie pipeline: I use this for Facebook messages too
01:42:54 <thetranstocommie> lemme throw my sim in my old phone. see if I get the text from insta
01:43:15 <M3> Sorry if that was too much text for one post
01:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> M3: no problem! I should make something clear before I go on:
01:49:06 <M3> mike_of_earth from what I've read from strcat and else, ROMs such as lineage actually compromise privacy to a degree because they weaken sandboxing running in debug mode, among other things iirc.  Supposedly they're is still some Google bits left over as well, but idk if that's true.
01:50:11 <thetranstocommie> OK yeah just confirmed my issue was just weird timing, my other phone didn't get the text either.
01:50:17 <rny> M3: security s the problem with lineage
01:50:26 <rny> and without security, you dont have privacy
01:50:38 <TheJollyRoger> If by "ROM" you mean "read only memory" you mean the operating system, on the operating system it comes with, or "factory ROM", Play Services are deeply integrated with the operating system, and the entire operating system image is actually signed and verified, and restored, bitwise, to its previous state on each reboot when the operating system is locked.
01:51:08 <TheJollyRoger> Without altering the system image, it's actually VERY possible to switch off or opt-out, of many of the more invasive elements of Google's data collection.
01:51:16 <TheJollyRoger> At least, with respect to the handsets released by Google.
01:51:37 <TheJollyRoger> I can't say the same with respect to the other third party vendors which will bundle their own third-party crapware, which often phones home to Google anyways or uses on relies on Play Services.
01:52:03 <TheJollyRoger> The phone will nag, pester, and nag the crap out of you to switch it back on, of course.
01:52:09 <thetranstocommie> <rny "and without security, you dont h"> in theory maybe, but like, in practice lineage os will still keep your data away from google. if anyone targets you you're screwed, but to just keep away from the tech giants its fine
01:52:23 <TheJollyRoger> *if by ROM you don't mean "Read only memory" and mean the operating system,
01:52:54 <rny> thetranstocommie: its **not** theory, depending on the level of sophistication from your adversary, you need security to maintain privacy.
01:53:12 <M3> TheJollyRoger I meant factory rom.  Forgot the correct terminoly
01:53:34 <rny> there's so many things that can go wrong in between you and your typical FAANG+ culprits
01:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> M3: Got it. I use "system image." If someone says "ROM" to me, that means they're physically slicing open the chip with a laser in a cleanroom environment.
01:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> Or at least, that's what I start thinking.
01:54:06 <rny> what about your ISP? the cisco router you're relaying traffic over? T2 net providers? your DNS provider? etc etc.
01:54:32 <m2tu[m]> Hi guys.. can anone hlp
01:54:47 <rny> if anything, tech giants should be the least of your concerns when it comes do doing right by you besides the casual monetization of user data.
01:54:53 <m2tu[m]> i was building perfect yeasterday
01:55:06 <rny> at least they've got the money to hire the right people to do the right things
01:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> Phones haven't loaded their operating systems from read-only memory in generations. Generally these days, the only stuff you'll find in true "Read Only Memory" are the hashes of the public keys, which are permanent e-fuses.
01:55:17 <TheJollyRoger> rny: hear, hear!
01:55:18 <m2tu[m]> today i begn m target commannds  and instad of blue line it came eng versoion.
01:55:21 <m2tu[m]> now i get error build/make/core/product_config.mk:170: error: device/google/crosshatch/aosp_blueline.mk: malformed COPY_FILE "\".
01:55:22 <m2tu[m]> 02:53:53 dumpvars failed with: exit status 1
01:55:22 <m2tu[m]> ** Not a valid product: aosp_blueline
01:55:52 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: it looks like you haven't set some of the environment variables. I forget which ones you need though.
01:55:52 <thetranstocommie> <rny "if anything, tech giants should "> I think that causal monetization is what most people wanna avoid when they degoogle. the wackjobs like me who either are or will likely be the targets of individuals are the tiny minority imo
01:56:13 <m2tu[m]> hmm
01:56:22 <m2tu[m]> yeasterday all was working
01:56:29 <m2tu[m]> i do blueline
01:56:36 <rny> m2tu[m]: did you repo sync?
01:56:52 <rny> reset the repositories
01:56:58 <rny> do a clean checkout
01:57:01 <m2tu[m]> but toda i run m target-files-package
01:57:20 <m2tu[m]> and instead of blueline aosp_arm came
01:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: the way I see it is security is a prerequisite to privacy. If you are chosing between the factory operating system image, or an OS that essentially has no security, you're choosing to essentially let big tech have it, or let the internet at large AND big tech have it.
01:57:26 <m2tu[m]> in som how than faults !
01:57:35 <m2tu[m]> hmm
01:57:44 <m2tu[m]> how do i rest thm by repo init
01:57:47 <rny> thetranstocommie: so in the process of de-googling, you are happy to have a bunch of shady providers exfiltrate data from your device? not even sure how that tradeoff pans out well
01:57:49 <m2tu[m]> or repo sync
01:58:56 <TheJollyRoger> The privacy community always amazes me at how they won't be like "EWW NO DON'T TRUST THE PIXEL HANDSETS!" nevermind that the Pixel handsets have had the greatest amount of transparency and owner controllability in a handset to this day, but then will go and run third party "Win10 Privacy" apps as the admin user on their main computer.
01:59:21 <TheJollyRoger> Or go run some sketchy 3rd-party build by some anonymous forum poster on XDA.
01:59:31 <thetranstocommie> I'm not trying to start an argument or anything. I think grapheneos is a fantastic project, I think its just overkill for most people who aren't likely to be the targets of attacks.
01:59:59 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: Of course, I get you.
02:00:08 <TheJollyRoger> But, there's an important thing that needs to be looked at:
02:00:36 <TheJollyRoger> Going back in time, you guys remember what was it... Wannacrypt0r? WannaCry?
02:00:41 <TheJollyRoger> I forget the exact name but it sounded like that.
02:01:10 <thetranstocommie> yeah if you're degoogling while using windows you should probably leave that asap
02:01:10 <m2tu[m]> do u know where to find buildnumber
02:01:23 <m2tu[m]> m old on got changed ;/////
02:01:34 <rny> thetranstocommie: why's that? windows is a good product
02:01:37 <TheJollyRoger> No, forget windows for a moment. What I'm getting at is that the vulnerability it used started out as a weapon from the National Security Agency, which got leaked. Within less than a *month* scriptkiddies were using it.
02:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> Software can be endlessly copied and reproduced.
02:01:46 <TheJollyRoger> so can attacks.
02:02:01 <TheJollyRoger> And they don't care who's running in them - whether that is a state sponsored adversary,
02:02:04 <thetranstocommie> windows is closed source spyware I'd rather be running templeos as my daily driver than windows.
02:02:20 <TheJollyRoger> or the kid next door that has too much time on his hands, wants to show off his l33tness, and has access to Da-da's credit card.
02:02:21 <rny> 🤯
02:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: that's toxic power user mentality speaking.
02:03:07 <thetranstocommie> its not that I love Linux its just that I really hate windows lol
02:03:34 <rny> figures.. it smelled like a deep hatred of big tech
02:04:01 <TheJollyRoger> The point I'm trying to make with this, is that nowadays, in some cases the only difference between attacks coming from state sponsored adversaries, and the kid next door who wants to prove how much of an "elite hacker" he is, is as little as CTRL-C and CTRL-V.
02:04:02 <thetranstocommie> well, windows is proprietary, and does some sketchy shit.
02:04:09 <rny> putting emotions aside, big tech companies do build secure products and take security seriously.
02:04:24 <skwisgaar[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: he is saying that running random untrusted code as administrator on a windows (or any) system is dangerous. Not that windows is bad.
02:04:41 <thetranstocommie> *she
02:04:53 <thetranstocommie> https://privacytools.io/operating-systems/#win10
02:05:26 <rny> thetranstocommie: alot of the privacy stuff, you can harden against
02:05:31 <rny> disable telemetry and stuff
02:05:45 <skwisgaar[m]> Privacy tools has a ton of misinformation on their site
02:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> We get this a lot. The telemetry in Windows isn't any different than the telemetry in the countless packages that comprise the various Linux distributions, and the more invasive stuff can be switched off. Of course, the FSF and many privacy communities would rather peddle FUD because it makes the lot of 'em feel better.
02:06:58 <TheJollyRoger> Linux has rested on its laurels of that kind of thinking for far too long.
02:07:33 <m2tu[m]> I have heard th simcards can now hold spywar whch can be actvated by gov requiremnt
02:07:39 <thetranstocommie> the difference is the Foss applications collecting your data, if they do it at all, probably isn't doing anything too sketchy with it. when Microsoft is collecting it they're only ever gonna do something sketchy with it
02:08:04 <thetranstocommie> my general advice is try Linux for a bit. if you can't switch, you can't switch. but if you can, awesome
02:08:06 <m2tu[m]> simcards can hav softwar installed ?? can that be true
02:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> And as a result, we've been in denial for about a decade at this point over Linux's lack of graphical isolation, exploit mitigations, lagging behind in sandboxing and containerization,
02:08:27 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: if it's turing complete, it can be exploited.
02:09:10 <m2tu[m]> probally binar encryptd
02:09:24 <TheJollyRoger> When someone tells me to "run Linux" I wonder if what I say will come off as a "flex."
02:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> *if what I say in response will come off as a "Flex".
02:12:41 <TheJollyRoger> Which honestly isn't how I intend it to.
02:12:51 <thetranstocommie> my question is why get involved in hardening your mobile phone, but then trusting a proprietary os with some privacy scripts to be good enough on desktop? BC as someone who's computer may get yoinked by a warrant someday soon, Id rather be using the OS that I know has no backdoors built into it.
02:13:24 <rny> thetranstocommie: what are you even talking about
02:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: these days, that's not how it works.
02:13:56 <rny> how do you know an os has no backdoors built into it if you dont comb through every line yourself?
02:14:12 <rny> you cant even vet the firmware code since they are closed source
02:14:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: reverse engineering
02:14:42 <louipcm> you don't
02:14:47 <TheJollyRoger> Those who have read or examined the Vault 7 or Shadowbrokers Dumps will notice that there's a conspicuous lack of a "golden key" built into every operating system or on the IPMI interfaces of every computer. Instead, they use small, low-hanging fruit and simple exploits which can work together in harmony.
02:14:51 <thetranstocommie> yeah, open sourcing more things would be based
02:15:00 <rny> anupritaisno1[m]: even with reverse engineering, you need to know where to look at
02:15:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> I would be hardly surprised if Daniel claimed he could read and understand assembly
02:15:19 <thetranstocommie> i WILL die on this hill 😤
02:15:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because I too can do that, kind of
02:15:41 <TheJollyRoger> That's how intelligence agencies operate: they rely on lack of humble exploit mitigations and basic security patches, because they know that those are the hardest to patch and it keeps their hands clean politically and avoids blow-back.
02:15:48 <rny> weird flex, but ok.
02:16:02 <TheJollyRoger> rny: nah, I decided not to drop it this time :p.
02:16:04 <rny> 👏🏽
02:16:12 <thetranstocommie> yeah i do all my coding in binary. kids these days relying on "programing languages" sm head
02:16:22 <mike_of_earth> hahah
02:16:35 <TheJollyRoger> I feel like one of those kiddies that say, unironically, "I run arch btw" every time I do it, hee hee.
02:16:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assembly was the first thing I learned tbh
02:17:12 <TheJollyRoger> o.O Holy shit.
02:17:35 <mike_of_earth> ouch. I learned Turbo Pascal... I just missed the Cobal craze
02:17:43 <rny> ok, this is going offtopic
02:17:53 <rny> pls flex in #grapheneos-offtopic
02:17:58 <mike_of_earth> hehe
02:18:03 <rny> 💪
02:18:10 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
02:18:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <mike_of_earth "hehe"> https://youtu.be/SAvmUSsafac
02:28:31 <m2tu[m]> is it possible to buypass screeen ?
02:28:39 <m2tu[m]> example by sideloading a crafted zp?
02:28:51 <m2tu[m]> zip wiht code screen lock rmoved?
02:29:25 <thetranstocommie> I don't think so, especially if you have USB debugging off.
02:30:21 <m2tu[m]> usbdebugging off or on wont help in boot mode ??
02:30:21 <m2tu[m]> or does it ?  becuase  hav sideloaded wihtout debug on.
02:31:28 <thetranstocommie> I don't really know for certain. I'm not a contributor or coder or anything, if someone else wants to field the question.
02:33:16 <rny> m2tu[m]: what are you trying to do?
02:33:36 <rny> screen needs to be unlocked for usb debugging
02:33:41 <rny> ffs
02:38:31 <M3> Had to step away for a moment, don't mean to derail
02:39:52 * m2tu[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MMCXQyRIdljJvUvssNMIKFac/message.txt >
02:40:06 <m2tu[m]> dammn what can be wrong  have mad repo sync 2 times
02:40:10 <m2tu[m]> and repo init
02:40:12 <m2tu[m]> still same error
02:42:16 <M3> TheJollyRoger people distrust the pixel line because of the whole open source vs closed source framing of the debste.  If it's fully open source then there's nothing to hide or flaws to miss, meanwhile if it's closed source it's relying on security by obscurity and may be backdoored and you wouldn't know.  Also big tech = evil so that doesn't
02:42:16 <M3> help.
02:42:56 <TheJollyRoger> M3: It's a bit of a pity, honestly, because Google's the only vendor that's allowed transparency and shown commitment towards open source there.
02:47:31 <m2tu[m]> anone know what can be wrong here
02:47:33 <m2tu[m]>  malformed COPY_FILE ""
02:47:44 <m2tu[m]> when building blueline
02:47:49 <louipcm> yea but i think pixels are just as open as any other phone.. probably moreso
02:49:11 <M3> Also, the idea that closed source equals indefinite opaque black box is strongly reinforced.  Now I'm not pretending I have anything more than a shallow understanding of all this, but this is the mentality
02:49:28 <M3> TheJollyRoger ^
02:49:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, I know the mentality :(
02:54:42 <neodyddlium[m]> Sprint's LTE network won't work on Graphene, correct?
02:55:33 <twm14> hey! i'm using GrapheneOS on a pixel 4a. Just updated on android and was adding a contact and I got a prompt to sync contacts with google. I can't figure out how to reproduce, but why would I get a google prompt on Graphene?
02:55:45 <zzxx1236> Sprint is still around ?
02:56:25 <neodyddlium[m]> Only still as T-Mobile's stepchild.
03:00:19 <neodyddlium[m]> I flashed GrapheneOS  to a pixel  4 and activated it at sprint, where I already had a line. My phone and SMS work fine, but it won't connect to LTE. I did a little searching, and apparently it is incompatible with sprint. Luckily I don't have a contract 🤷🏻‍♂️
03:03:54 <M3> TheJollyRoger I had this mentality more strongly up until recently myself, but my fear of a false sense of privacy is too great not to double check what I read haha
03:04:29 <bizanon[m]> hello
03:05:11 <TheJollyRoger> M3 yeah, it's always good to continuously re-evaluate one's self and one's priorities!
03:05:14 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Ahoy!
03:06:16 <bizanon[m]> can I ask a question about the camera function?
03:06:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, this be the place!
03:07:00 <bizanon[m]> wondering if there is an EXIF footprint from images taken with the base camera app
03:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> tw_1[m]: It's likely that the contact app has that as stub functionality. However, the contacts app functions offline, and even if it didn't, play services is offline.
03:07:46 <TheJollyRoger> *play services can't be reached on GrapheneOS. Because we don't have play services.
03:10:56 <rny> bizanon[m]: of course
03:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Just a mo'
03:11:10 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try and get you what's in it.
03:11:34 <rny> gps (if location switched on), camera vendor/model at least
03:12:00 <rny> and date too
03:12:23 <rny> iirc, opencamera has options to suppress
03:12:31 <rny> otherwise, use a tool to sanitize them
03:13:39 <TheJollyRoger> Let's see... yup, date and time, camera maker, camera model, F-stop, exposure time ISO speed, focal length, flash, white balance, EXIF version, yes it does have location. Interestingly enough, Title and Authors are blank.
03:13:53 <TheJollyRoger> Obviously, resolution and dimensions, and bit depth.
03:13:56 <bizanon[m]> did you have GPs off?
03:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> No, I took a test photo with Location on and Location allowed so it'd show up.
03:14:29 <bizanon[m]> gotcha
03:14:41 <bizanon[m]> thank you rny and jollyroger
03:15:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Camera maker and model will show up as "Google" and "Pixel 4" respectively.
03:16:03 <rny> i rely on exif heavily to sort/manage on nextcloud
03:16:14 <rny> 🙃
03:20:41 * bizanon[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210203-212013_Open Camera.jpg (100KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/OMzriWItVOBcGsbfDQaFXTBo/Screenshot_20210203-212013_Open Camera.jpg >
03:20:44 <bizanon[m]> Is this what you are referring to? rny
03:21:17 <thetranstocommie> hey, does vanadium have working notifications? no browser I've ever found on f droid has functioning notifications, even if they look like they do.
03:21:27 <rny> bizanon[m]: no
03:21:34 <rny> that stamp, prints onto the actual photo
03:21:54 <rny> maybe i misremembered then
03:28:10 <M3> TheJollyRoger what is your opinion on Sony Xperias?  They seem to provide a good amount of open device support and keep their factory roms pretty close to stock from what I've seen.
03:31:22 <entry1[m]> <rny "that stamp, prints onto the actu"> Oh so even if the exif/metadata is deleted on the image file, it is still unnoticeably watermarked/stamped to be traced by to the device?
03:31:42 <entry1[m]> * Oh so even if the exif/metadata is deleted on the image file, it is still unnoticeably watermarked/stamped to be traced back to the device?
03:31:58 <somenerd[m]> also, I believe that AOSP camera had location tagging off by default, right?
03:32:49 <bizanon[m]> <entry1[m] "Oh so even if the exif/metadata "> how can it be traced back if GPS is off?
03:33:08 <somenerd[m]> <somenerd[m] "also, I believe that AOSP camera"> on GrapheneOS, that is
03:34:14 <entry1[m]> <bizanon[m] "how can it be traced back if GPS"> I was asking, I wasn't aware of a physical metadata attribution other than the obvious metadata that corresponds with camera images
03:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> M3: ah, sorry, I don't.
03:39:26 <somenerd[m]> I think if you revoke the location permission, EXIF doesn't include it right?
03:40:24 <bizanon[m]> I think so
03:41:16 <bizanon[m]> I know GOS doesnt use microG. but I've been reading about unifiedNlp. can it expose my geolocation with WIFI alone? or mobile network needs to be on as well?
03:41:46 <M3> TheJollyRoger you mean you don't have one of them right?  In any case it's alright since they only have 1 percent market share of smartphones haha
03:42:42 <strcat[m]> bizanon: we don't use that either
03:43:27 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the Location permission and global toggle for anything being able to use it controls access to multiple forms of location data, not just GPS
03:44:02 <strcat[m]> GPS, Wi-Fi network scanning, Bluetooth device scanning, etc. is controlled by Location
03:44:07 <strcat[m]> cell network scanning
03:44:15 <strcat[m]> it means Location (like it says) not GPS
03:44:43 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth scanning isn'
03:44:53 <strcat[m]>  * Bluetooth scanning isn't a separate thing
03:45:23 <strcat[m]> but rather low-level Bluetooth permission basically does nothing by itself - you either have to explicitly allow pairing with a device (where you choose it, etc.) or grant location access for scanning
03:45:24 <bizanon[m]> if I were to use a phone that has unifiednlp but I never turn put a sim inside, only use wifi, can it expose my geolocation? Is what I'm trying to figure out. I know that GOs is pretty secure for that
03:45:39 <somenerd[m]> well, now I know that random news articles on the internet aren't meant to be trusted
03:45:40 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's not clear what you're asking
03:45:51 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the Location permission controls access to location
03:46:04 <strcat[m]> there's a global toggle that controls whether the permission actually grants access to anything
03:46:13 <somenerd[m]> the location permission stops unifiednlp
03:46:26 <somenerd[m]> even on AOSP
03:46:36 <bizanon[m]> ahh I see
03:46:37 <strcat[m]> bizanon: if you grant an app access to Location and you have Location toggled on globally, then the app you granted it to can detect location, it doesn't need GPS
03:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> M3: heh, yeah, I don't have one and haven't got any information on those, so I can't really say much more than that, unfortunately.
03:47:30 <somenerd[m]> I've seen this described as a threat, but it's already been dealt with
03:47:33 <bizanon[m]> lets say on AOSP, you grant app access to location
03:47:33 <bizanon[m]> but you turn off GPS, and never put inside the Sim card. Never turn on bluetooth.
03:47:33 <bizanon[m]> Can it still reveal geolocation?
03:47:44 <strcat[m]> there is no such thing as turning off GPS only
03:47:51 <strcat[m]> bizanon: there is a Location permission and a global Location toggle
03:47:55 <strcat[m]> you seem confused about how this works
03:48:01 <strcat[m]> there is no such thing as a GPS toggle
03:48:17 <strcat[m]> if you turn off Location, the GPS can't be used, and neither can Wi-Fi scanning, cellular network scanning, etc.
03:48:39 <strcat[m]> the OS has no GPS toggle, it doesn't have semantics that make sense, since there are other ways to get location
03:48:42 <bizanon[m]> oh I see the error in my question
03:48:47 <strcat[m]> it has a Location toggle and a Location permission
03:48:54 <strcat[m]> there is no separate GPS one since it wouldn't make sense
03:49:13 <bizanon[m]> so even on AOSP, location toggle is pretty damn secure even if you turn on wifi
03:49:20 <strcat[m]> Location: GNSS (including GPS), Wi-Fi network scanning (when combined with low-level declaration of using that), cell network scanning (similar), Bluetooth scanning (similar)
03:49:48 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the Location permission + Location toggle is a 2 layer check for any app request for location or those things I listed which leak it (and some other things)
03:49:55 <strcat[m]> Location permission not granted to app: it can't do any of that
03:50:01 <strcat[m]> Location toggle not on globally: no apps can do any of that
03:50:09 <bizanon[m]> gotcha
03:50:17 <bizanon[m]> makes perfect sense now that you explain it like that
03:50:23 <strcat[m]> it's not really complicated, there is just no such thing as a separate GPS toggle, people wrongly interpret Location toggle as that
03:50:28 <strcat[m]> it means Location detection, not GPS
03:50:35 <strcat[m]> and there isn't just GPS, there's GLONASS and other things
03:51:29 <mishmasher[m]> Hey I've been wondering something. What if you have malware on your device that is able to record your screen(I heard it exists and was used on Encrochat) would that malware also be able to look on your screen in different profile's?
03:51:43 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it isn't perfect, there are things like ultrasonic audio beacons so audio recording can be used to detect nearby beacons (or audio playback to go the other way) but there is already a permission for audio recording, it only ever works in the foreground and it is a lot scarier than location detection alone anyway
03:51:58 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: not clear what you're asking
03:52:09 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: apps can't simply record the screen
03:52:33 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: Encrochat had malicious updates pushed out via their servers
03:52:57 <bizanon[m]> there is a global switch for audio recording no?
03:53:01 <somenerd[m]> >but there is already a permission for audio recording, it only ever works in the foreground and it is a lot scarier than location detection alone anyway
03:53:04 <somenerd[m]> the sensor permission
03:53:10 <strcat[m]> no
03:53:20 <somenerd[m]> even worse?
03:53:26 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you're saying
03:53:44 <somenerd[m]> I was referring to the permission you were talking about
03:53:54 <strcat[m]> bizanon: audio recording is a per-app permission, like other permissions, you can browse by permission rather than by app in Settings
03:54:01 <bizanon[m]> iirc, when im using textnow app,. it asks for audio permission. so I assume there is a global setting for that
03:54:07 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's a permission
03:54:19 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's not global, it's per-app
03:54:25 <bizanon[m]> k
03:54:36 <strcat[m]> bizanon: look in the Settings app at the permission manager
03:54:52 <strcat[m]> there are standard user-facing permissions like audio recording, location, camera, etc.
03:55:02 <strcat[m]> many of those are only possible to grant for foreground usage (camera, audio, etc.)
03:55:50 <strcat[m]> bizanon: Location is special and has a global toggle which is an additional check, other stuff isn't like that, and the system would work fine if the global toggle didn't exist
03:55:59 <mishmasher[m]> <strcat[m] "mishmasher: Encrochat had malici"> Yes I read that and the alphabet agencies were able to look at the users screen in real time, now let's say that happens to grapheneos update server would all profiles be compromised?
03:56:13 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: no, read the info on the site
03:56:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
03:56:29 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
03:56:29 <strcat[m]> read
03:56:35 <mishmasher[m]> With profiles I mean users btw
03:56:48 <somenerd[m]> no
03:56:54 <strcat[m]> a compromise of the update server would not impact GrapheneOS users beyond wasted data
03:56:54 <somenerd[m]> the server is distrusted
03:56:56 <strcat[m]> covered on the site
03:57:57 <strcat[m]> bizanon: Sensors permission is something we add - sensors can only ever be accessed in the foreground (same as AOSP) but we add a way to toggle them off there too
03:58:01 <bizanon[m]> <mishmasher[m] "Yes I read that and the alphabet"> something like this? https://github.com/qH0sT/AndroSpy
03:58:05 <strcat[m]> bizanon: Sensors means sensors not covered by an existing permission
03:58:22 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's not helpful
03:58:25 <strcat[m]> they're already confused
03:58:39 <strcat[m]> linking to something that requests a permission to do something and is able to do it if you grant it is not relevant
03:59:38 <somenerd[m]> if you don't grant it?
03:59:47 <somenerd[m]> oh
04:00:12 <strcat[m]> there's a lot of info available on our site and the Android project site
04:00:24 <strcat[m]> the developers site specifically
04:00:47 <somenerd[m]> the source site seemed helpful for me
04:01:09 <bizanon[m]> <strcat[m] "bizanon: Sensors permission is s"> that's great
04:01:32 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the issue with those sensors (compass, gyroscope, accelerometers, etc.) is that they can be used to leak data about sensitive things
04:01:38 <strcat[m]> Android limits polling them to 200Hz, etc.
04:01:43 <strcat[m]> to mitigate this
04:01:49 <strcat[m]> but they can still be used to leak data
04:02:05 <rny> 200hz is quite substantial
04:02:10 <strcat[m]> and that can be cleverly used to infer stuff about location or audio
04:02:16 <strcat[m]> even though it doesn't provide much
04:02:38 <rny> i can probably work out where you've been with stale gps and 200hz sampling
04:03:01 <strcat[m]> it can be used to roughly track movement
04:03:04 <strcat[m]> ofc as I said app has to be in the foreground
04:03:18 <strcat[m]> and then a rough idea of movement could be matched to routes on a map
04:03:22 <strcat[m]> to get location
04:03:32 <strcat[m]> difficult but possible
04:03:50 <strcat[m]> bizanon: anyway our added permissions are Network (direct and indirect network access) and Sensors
04:03:56 <strcat[m]> and since we add them, apps don't know how to request them
04:04:33 <rny> im surprised they need up to 200hz
04:04:33 <strcat[m]> so they are enabled by default for compatibility - you can choose to disable them before launching an app though, and apps can't run before they are started once (at install time or after manually doing force stop)
04:04:53 <rny> you can get a lot of stuff done with 50hz
04:05:05 <strcat[m]> bizanon: rest of the permission model is basically the same now because AOSP got the background access restrictions added to in Android 9 / 10
04:05:40 <strcat[m]> i.e. audio recording, camera, sensors only in foreground, clipboard read only by focused app and selected keyboard, location can be granted as foreground only when requested too
04:05:55 <strcat[m]>  * i.e. audio recording, camera, sensors only in foreground, clipboard reading only by focused app and selected keyboard, location can be granted as foreground only when requested too
04:06:48 <strcat[m]> we used to provide background access toggles ourselves - now it's just standard, and there is no way to even do it for audio/camera/sensors (clipboard is stricter - focused apps can read, foreground that aren't focused can't)
04:07:08 <strcat[m]> difference is if an app is running a foreground service (which has to be started in the foreground, and then keeps it in the foreground) it still can't read clipboard
04:07:24 <strcat[m]> a lot of this info is in our FAQ, etc.
04:07:40 <strcat[m]>  * difference is if an app is running a foreground service (which keeps it in the foreground) it still can't read clipboard
04:08:21 <mishmasher[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: must have read over the update security part but, I get it now thanks!
04:08:58 <bizanon[m]> U talking about this right
04:09:17 * bizanon[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210203-220841_Chrome.jpg (76KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DVkeeJVqrGHlFSSPwpIdXiFG/Screenshot_20210203-220841_Chrome.jpg >
04:09:46 <strcat[m]> Vanadium disallows sites to access sensors by default
04:09:54 <strcat[m]> most browsers allow it
04:10:15 <bizanon[m]> other apps can get that info right
04:10:26 <strcat[m]> you're making it more complicated by bringing up the second layer of the browser permission model
04:10:26 <bizanon[m]> not just browser apps
04:10:36 <somenerd[m]> > Vanadium disallows sites to access sensors by default
04:10:36 <somenerd[m]> Bromite too
04:10:37 <strcat[m]> bizanon: I explained above
04:10:45 <strcat[m]> you're making it a lot more complicated by bringing browsers into it
04:10:51 <strcat[m]> browsers are not somehow special apps
04:10:56 <strcat[m]> the regular permission system applies to them
04:11:13 <strcat[m]> they implement their own permission system for sites, it doesn't in any way bypass the OS one
04:11:27 <strcat[m]> if you disallow the browser from using Sensors, then it can't use them as a whole
04:11:40 <strcat[m]> and as I said, Vanadium disallows sites from using sensors by default
04:12:00 <strcat[m]> you would have to go into the settings to enable that in site settings
04:12:01 <somenerd[m]>  * > Vanadium disallows sites to access sensors by default
04:12:01 <somenerd[m]> Bromite too (same patch)
04:12:31 <bizanon[m]> im asking AOSP apps can request that data but not on GOS?
04:12:44 <strcat[m]> don't understand the question
04:12:49 <strcat[m]> I explained it all above
04:13:00 <somenerd[m]> I mean, AOSP apps can access it
04:13:02 <strcat[m]> repeating it probably isn't helpful
04:13:08 <somenerd[m]> ok then
04:13:18 <rny> check manifest when in doubyt
04:13:38 <strcat[m]> bizanon: on Android, apps in the foreground can access miscellaneous sensors
04:13:40 <rny> download the fkin app and look at the manifest
04:13:55 <strcat[m]> bizanon: on GrapheneOS, there's a Sensors toggle for disallowing apps in the foreground from using them too
04:14:14 <strcat[m]> bizanon: if you make it more complicated by bringing browsers into it (which have their own extra layer of permissions for sites), well, now you're changing the topic
04:14:25 <rny> dont understand why people keep asking to do their homework
04:14:34 <strcat[m]> the OS permissions apply to browsers like any other app
04:14:34 <bizanon[m]> ok got it
04:14:35 <bizanon[m]> thanks
04:14:55 <strcat[m]> if you enable sensors access in Vanadium for sites
04:14:58 <strcat[m]> but disable it for the app
04:15:00 <strcat[m]> sites can't access it
04:15:10 <strcat[m]> they can't access it by default though because it disallows that
04:15:42 <strcat[m]> if you allow Camera all for Vanadium, that doesn't mean sites can access it, they have to request permission and have you grant it
04:16:17 <strcat[m]> the browser permission model sits on top of the OS one, the browser doesn't have special privileges, it's an app
04:16:30 <strcat[m]> if you take away the Camera permission after allowing a site to access it, now the browser can't access it, so the site can't despite you granting that
04:17:13 <jonzlo[m]> <strcat[m] "if you take away the Camera perm"> You are the man.
04:17:27 <bizanon[m]> is GOS the only OS that can disable sensor cause you guys wrote it?
04:17:52 <somenerd[m]> probably not cause GrapheneOS wrote it
04:18:01 <somenerd[m]>  * probably not "cause GrapheneOS wrote it"
04:18:03 <strcat[m]> we made the Network and Sensors toggles, they aren't in AOSP
04:18:23 <strcat[m]> Android operating systems aren't allowed to add runtime permissions like we do
04:18:28 <bizanon[m]> it's a great addition
04:18:32 <strcat[m]> the CDD forbids adding them
04:18:46 <strcat[m]> but GrapheneOS isn't Android and doesn't care what the CDD says when it doesn't impact compatibility for real
04:19:29 <bizanon[m]> does calyx have something similar or no
04:19:48 <somenerd[m]> bit offtopic, but no for the sensor perm
04:19:56 <somenerd[m]> and the firewall is weaker afaik
04:20:03 <strcat[m]> bizanon: no, and they don't have a *working* equivalent to Network either
04:20:20 <bizanon[m]> ahh gotcha
04:20:20 <strcat[m]> bizanon: and I'd recommend looking at https://grapheneos.org/features
04:20:21 <somenerd[m]> they could just implement the GrapheneOS ones
04:20:25 <somenerd[m]> the code is there lol
04:20:29 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is a hardened OS, it improves the fundamental privacy and security of the OS
04:20:45 <jonzlo[m]> I work in a high threat environment conducting various shades of security for all kinds of crazy. You have been the ultimate in privacy and security up to this point. I thank you and commend you on your stoic pursuit. I'll be sure to donate again soon.
04:21:12 <strcat[m]> somenerd: atm they aren't really welcome to take our code (legal != welcome to do it) based on the state of things
04:21:33 <somenerd[m]> I meant before
04:26:01 <jonzlo[m]> <strcat[m] "GrapheneOS is a hardened OS, it "> Could you provide a direct link for donations, sil vous plaís?
04:26:17 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/donate
04:26:19 <strcat[m]> you mean that?
04:26:33 <strcat[m]> there are 4 ways to donate
04:27:00 <jonzlo[m]> Absofuckinglutely.
04:28:18 <Baloo> Anyone else with the Pixel 3a have their phone end up in a bootloop after the recent update?>
04:28:42 <thetranstocommie> this is a really little thing, but thank y'all for having a sane default theme out of the box lol
04:28:42 <faxing[m]> <Baloo "Anyone else with the Pixel 3a ha"> Nope
04:28:57 <faxing[m]> <thetranstocommie "this is a really little thing, b"> ikr, nice and stock
04:29:54 <jonzlo[m]> <strcat[m] "you mean that?"> $100 worth of BTC on the way.
04:30:37 <somenerd[m]> dark theme/light theme out of the box?
04:30:39 <faxing[m]> <Baloo "Anyone else with the Pixel 3a ha"> I know it seems like a small thing, but you had a stable internet connection throughout the whole update process, yes?
04:30:52 <faxing[m]> <jonzlo[m] "$100 worth of BTC on the way."> That's awesome
04:31:03 <Baloo> my phone half downloaded the update and it ceased to continue downloading. Attempted to check for updates, the status bar disappeared. Restarted the phone. The phone has come out of the booting mode thankfully, but I have no idea if the new update downloaded
04:31:07 <Baloo> says I am updated to Android 11
04:31:21 <faxing[m]> check the build number
04:31:22 <Baloo> I was worried for a minute there because it took a long time to start up
04:31:38 <strcat[m]> Baloo: if a new update fails to boot it rolls back
04:31:45 <strcat[m]> (if it fails multiple times)
04:31:52 <Baloo> strcat: Thanks for that info.
04:32:08 <strcat[m]> Baloo: the bad news is that it's possible your flash memory is failing
04:32:17 <strcat[m]> you should confirm it rolled back
04:32:20 <strcat[m]> it'll try updating again
04:32:35 <Baloo> let me check here
04:32:38 <faxing[m]> <Baloo "says I am updated to Android 11"> Check build number.
04:32:44 <DixieDean[m]> Is this a confirmed issue with the 3A because I'm about to update mine.
04:32:51 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: no
04:32:53 <strcat[m]> it works fine
04:32:53 <DixieDean[m]> Or just a bad download/checksum
04:32:56 <faxing[m]> I didn't get it
04:32:56 <DixieDean[m]> Ah ok cool
04:33:00 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: it's not possible to have a bad download
04:33:08 <faxing[m]> I updated tonight and it's working flawless like always
04:33:20 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: it verifies the signature when it's done
04:33:31 <Baloo> RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.02.09
04:33:50 <faxing[m]> you updated
04:33:59 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: it downloads via TLS and then checks the signature of the update, and after it writes it out, it checks the hash of each image, before activating it
04:34:20 <strcat[m]> Baloo: was it actually boot looping or were you thinking it got frozen and forcing it off?
04:34:29 <strcat[m]> Baloo: Pixel 3a storage is really slow
04:34:31 <jonzlo[m]> <faxing[m] "I updated tonight and it's worki"> Same
04:34:40 <strcat[m]> Baloo: cause, it didn't roll back after all
04:35:16 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: and then if the update somehow fails to boot despite everyone having the same hardware + it being tested first, it rolls back and boots up the old version
04:35:19 <DixieDean[m]> Also.  I have a broken glass on my 3A which is gonna cost me like $100 to replace the Glass/LCD because my local Chinese guy says it's a nightmare to do just the glass.     What's the current support roadmap for the 3A or should I just spend the extra $150 and get the 4A.
04:35:32 <Baloo> I know for sure I didn't get a confirmation of the update ever finishing, got a half finished bar. Restarted the phone after I attempted to check for updates which caused the bar to disappear. It probably didn't bootloop but took longer than usual to start again. But looking at the build number it did update.
04:35:44 <Baloo> so it probably was not a bootloop then.
04:35:52 <strcat[m]> probably just get a 4a
04:35:53 <strcat[m]> it's much better than a 3a and has over a year more of support
04:36:16 <faxing[m]> 4a is faster and'll have an extra year plus of updates
04:36:17 <strcat[m]> 3a has crappy eMMC storage
04:36:17 <faxing[m]> bar anything happening to the project, of course
04:36:17 <faxing[m]> yeah what strcat said
04:36:21 <Baloo> Thanks yeah it is on my radar to get a new phone for sure.
04:36:30 <strcat[m]> Baloo: it's probably just that the 3a storage gets slower over time and it's starting to take a long time to boot for most people (on stock or not)
04:36:39 <jonzlo[m]> <DixieDean[m] "Also.  I have a broken glass on "> Roll with the 4. Longer support timeframe. And get it on the cheap through Swappa.com
04:36:41 <Baloo> I've got about 70% of storage used on this phone, 19GB free.
04:36:52 <Baloo> strcat: Got it, thanks for the insight.
04:36:53 <somenerd[m]> I think that even the Pixel 2 series had better storage or something right?
04:37:05 <strcat[m]> somenerd: Pixel 1 had much better storage than 3a
04:37:09 <strcat[m]> Pixel 1 had UFS SSD
04:37:16 <DixieDean[m]> Yeah I'm gonna grab one used.   This week I think.
04:37:17 <somenerd[m]> while the eMMC was quite slow in terms of exec spawning
04:37:18 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3a went back to eMMC like Nexus
04:37:25 <somenerd[m]> <somenerd[m] "while the eMMC was quite slow in"> not quite
04:37:28 <strcat[m]> 4a is proper SSD again
04:37:37 <somenerd[m]> cool
04:37:39 <strcat[m]> 4a is a really good device and a really good deal
04:37:41 <somenerd[m]> wonder why they chose to do that
04:37:53 <strcat[m]> the 4a 5G and 5 are fine but they aren't a good deal and 5G is pretty meh at this point
04:38:03 <somenerd[m]> > <@lelmister101:matrix.org> while the eMMC was quite slow in terms of exec spawning
04:38:04 <somenerd[m]>  * not *that* bad (like 100ms?)
04:38:05 <strcat[m]> 5a will be more compelling
04:38:20 <strcat[m]> 5G radio cost will have come down a lot
04:38:21 <DixieDean[m]> My friend has the 5 5G
04:38:35 <DixieDean[m]> It's a beautiful phone but not really any difference feature wise
04:38:42 <somenerd[m]> I mean, glad that Google made their main phones the android reference devices
04:38:50 <somenerd[m]> versus some obscure board or phone
04:39:18 <strcat[m]> somenerd: they do have reference boards
04:39:18 <DixieDean[m]> Wonder if they will ever drop a Pixel flagship
04:39:29 <DixieDean[m]> Like a $1000 version
04:39:38 <strcat[m]> somenerd: the AOSP reference boards aren't made by Google tho
04:39:50 <DixieDean[m]> To go toe to toe with the iPhone/S20 etc
04:40:03 <somenerd[m]> the normal Pixels?
04:40:23 <DixieDean[m]> I would be interested in a pixel with say 16GB. Ram etc
04:40:41 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: if we find a good hardware partner our initial device would likely be very high end
04:40:59 <strcat[m]> because there's going to be a high cost per device for starting to do it
04:41:03 <strcat[m]> so budget isn't an option
04:41:04 <Baloo> Boy, a $200 premium just for 5g doesn't even seem worth it. I'll have to save and pick up a 4a when I can.
04:41:09 <strcat[m]> and a lot of RAM would be really good for hardened_malloc
04:41:23 <DixieDean[m]> I used to buy OnePlus guy, my last device was a 6T which I still use for normie stuff
04:41:29 <DixieDean[m]> So I'm used to that ummph
04:41:32 <somenerd[m]> and maybe future VM support
04:41:39 <strcat[m]> Baloo: 4a 5G is a new gen device not just a 4a with 5G
04:41:45 <strcat[m]> Baloo: we don't support 4a 5G yet tho
04:41:53 <strcat[m]> and it seems Pixel 5 support will come before 4a 5G
04:42:07 <strcat[m]> Baloo: the 4a 5G is a cheaper Pixel 5
04:42:13 <strcat[m]> they didn't call it a 5a because that's coming later
04:42:20 <strcat[m]> it's a badly named device
04:42:33 <Baloo> Got it, I had noticed you saying that earlier in the chat and I had read Google almost called it the 5a.
04:42:43 <DixieDean[m]> I would love to see generic arm 64 build for say the RPi
04:42:53 <DixieDean[m]> Even with licensing
04:42:59 <Baloo> odd naming, but I'
04:43:01 <somenerd[m]> They should call it 4.5a or something lol
04:43:15 <DixieDean[m]> Like the way you had to buy the codec keys on the old pi and enter it in a text file on /boot
04:43:28 <Baloo> I'll only buy whatever phone is compatible with Graphene. I've rolled with it for two years about now and it has served all of my purposes.
04:44:40 <DixieDean[m]> Same at this point.  I do think you need two devices in a lot of real world use cases.
04:44:59 <DixieDean[m]> Like in my city it's impossible to use cash or travel without some form of app now
04:45:29 <DixieDean[m]> So I keep the OPO 6T for all that stuff.
04:45:41 <refraction[m]> Does GOS support physical keyboards by the way?
04:45:45 <neodyddlium[m]> Can anyone confirm if T-Mobile works properly with Graphene?
04:45:45 <strcat[m]> refraction: yes
04:45:46 <strcat[m]> and mice
04:45:52 <strcat[m]> like AOSP
04:45:57 <strcat[m]> neodyddlium: yes works fine
04:46:00 <faxing[m]> <neodyddlium[m] "Can anyone confirm if T-Mobile w"> Mint odes
04:46:02 <faxing[m]> does*
04:46:12 <faxing[m]> so I can only assume that T-Mobile would work just as well
04:46:43 <refraction[m]> Weird. I tried connecting my keyboard through USB-C and it didn't work
04:46:53 <neodyddlium[m]> <strcat[m] "neodyddlium: yes works fine"> Thank you.
04:46:56 <refraction[m]> I'll try another cable and see then
04:46:56 <strcat[m]> refraction: by default, USB devices connected while locked are ignored
04:46:58 <strcat[m]> refraction: on GrapheneOS
04:47:12 <strcat[m]>  * refraction: by default, USB peripherals connected while locked are ignored
04:47:14 <refraction[m]> Oh. Let me try it again then.
04:47:17 <refraction[m]> Thanks.
04:47:23 <strcat[m]> so connect it while unlocked
04:47:29 <strcat[m]> recommend leaving that setting as is
04:47:40 <strcat[m]> refraction: keyboard / mouse work
04:47:45 <strcat[m]> and there are keybinds for copy, paste, etc.
04:47:57 <strcat[m]> not generally very practical but it works
04:48:01 <strcat[m]> if you plug in a mouse there's a cursor
04:48:12 <strcat[m]> apps have to support this stuff to work properly in ChromeOS
04:48:18 <DixieDean[m]> <strcat[m] "refraction: by default, USB devi"> Is this to combat things like Cellebrite hardware?
04:48:33 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: it's to reduce attack surface while locked
04:48:50 <DixieDean[m]> How does GOS hold up to forensics
04:49:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
04:49:25 <DixieDean[m]> Like in my threat model that's not an issue.  I just hate google lol
04:49:29 <DixieDean[m]> But it's nice to know
04:50:18 <refraction[m]> Huh. It works now. It was actually two faulty cables.
04:50:33 <strcat[m]> refraction: most USB-C cables don't work right
04:50:48 <strcat[m]> particularly A to C ones
04:50:54 <strcat[m]> the device comes with a good A to C adapter
04:51:06 <refraction[m]> I'm using a C to C one but it's old
04:51:13 <refraction[m]> So it must have broke or something
04:51:16 <strcat[m]> refraction: a lot of older C to C weren't made to spec
04:51:33 <strcat[m]> I'd say 50%+ of current A to C ones are broken by design
04:51:44 <strcat[m]> most C to C are fine.. unless older
04:52:01 <strcat[m]> a lot of them are fire hazards tho
04:52:09 <strcat[m]> by fine I mean they can transfer data successfully
04:52:12 <strcat[m]> many may burn down your house
04:52:14 <strcat[m]> but that's a separate issue
04:52:19 <strcat[m]> don't cheap out on cables
04:52:21 <refraction[m]> Yeah. I just used the stock Pixel cable and it works now
04:52:48 <refraction[m]> Though I thought it's usually the adaptors that are the fire hazards though
04:53:06 <DixieDean[m]> I have a Chromebook that I've converted to Linux.  Yet again great Google hardware.  Crap privacy lol
04:53:16 <DixieDean[m]> But the USB C ports come in handy
04:54:04 <DixieDean[m]> You can actually flash back to stock from Chrome OS now.  They released like a browser based tool for doing it.
04:55:14 <strcat[m]> you can flash GrapheneOS from ChromeOS or another Android/GrapheneOS device with https://grapheneos.org/install/web
04:55:27 <DixieDean[m]> Well holy sh1t.
04:55:31 <DixieDean[m]> I didn't know that
04:55:58 <refraction[m]> Oh? The web installer was actually finished?
04:56:06 <refraction[m]> That's great!
04:56:21 <strcat[m]> refraction: yes
04:56:29 <strcat[m]> refraction: it's really good
04:56:39 <somenerd[m]> that second use case (from a GrapheneOS device) seems very interesting
04:56:43 <somenerd[m]> and it sure is amazing
04:56:48 <strcat[m]> you can buy 2 Pixel 4a
04:56:52 <strcat[m]> flash GrapheneOS on one from the other
04:56:55 <refraction[m]> Reminds me of Tails
04:56:57 <strcat[m]> then flash GrapheneOS on the other from GrapheneOS
04:57:07 <DixieDean[m]> Wait.  I can flash another phone from my phone?
04:57:12 <DixieDean[m]> Whoa
04:57:15 <strcat[m]> Dixie Dean: yes via our web installer
04:57:23 <DixieDean[m]> [mindblow]
04:57:26 <thetranstocommie> that's insane
04:57:31 <strcat[m]> WebUSB works fine on GrapheneOS, you can also use it to use a Trezor with GrapheneOS via Vanadium
04:57:33 <strcat[m]> using Trezor Suite
04:57:41 <strcat[m]> https://suite.trezor.io/web/
04:57:44 <strcat[m]> can self-host it
04:58:00 <DixieDean[m]> That is actually mental
04:58:05 <DixieDean[m]> I've gotta try this
04:58:06 <DixieDean[m]> Lol
04:58:11 <strcat[m]> our web installer is worth trying
04:58:14 <strcat[m]> it's really good
04:58:33 <somenerd[m]> it's probably one of the best user facing features
04:58:35 <somenerd[m]> imo
04:58:39 <thetranstocommie> oh that reminds me! bug I found when installing. likely not the installers fault at all, but may be worth noting: the installer will NOT work when using a chromium flatpak. drove me crazy for a while before I realized it was a flatpak issue.
04:58:42 <strcat[m]> on Android/GrapheneOS you have to press a reconnect button after each reboot during the install
04:58:47 <strcat[m]> and confirm allowing access again
04:58:51 <strcat[m]> so it's a bit more inconvenient
04:58:56 <strcat[m]> due to the OS permission model for USB
04:59:01 <strcat[m]> but it works
04:59:51 <thetranstocommie> also, I just read the little roadmap section on the site and holy shit I didn't realize how ambitious this project was
05:01:18 <bizanon[m]> grapheneos installs on chromebooks?
05:01:22 <bizanon[m]> i didnt know that
05:01:53 <strcat[m]> bizanon: no
05:02:00 <strcat[m]> saying you can use ChromeOS to install GrapheneOS on a phone
05:02:11 <bizanon[m]> oh ok
05:03:18 <refraction[m]> strcat Not a feature request, but I'm just curious on your opinion of GOS on Blackberry Android devices (Since they tout around their security and all that)
05:03:37 <DixieDean[m]> Yeah I would really like GrapheneOS on a laptop or SBC like a Pi4B
05:03:55 <DixieDean[m]> I know I can build it with a generic target but I never attempted it
05:03:57 <thetranstocommie> that sounds like it would be a hell of a project
05:04:03 <strcat[m]> refraction: uh, they're garbage
05:04:14 <strcat[m]> refraction: and Blackberry didn't make the recent Blackberry Android devices
05:04:29 <strcat[m]> they leased their brand to TCL, which is the Chinese government (I mean that literally)
05:04:30 <thetranstocommie> I think they look nice at least lol. that's about it for the positives.
05:04:37 <DixieDean[m]> The worst thing RIM ever did was license it out
05:04:40 <refraction[m]> Oh. That's a shame
05:04:52 <DixieDean[m]> BES is still great
05:04:57 <strcat[m]> refraction: the Chinese government made those phones
05:04:58 <thetranstocommie> apparently there's a new blackberry licensed phone coming out this year tho
05:05:10 <strcat[m]> anyway Blackberry's stuff has always been overrated
05:05:16 <strcat[m]> their encryption has backdoors
05:05:21 <strcat[m]> they let governments monitor it
05:05:26 <refraction[m]> Even on the older devices?
05:05:29 <strcat[m]> yes
05:05:37 <strcat[m]> their own Android phone was trash
05:05:41 <strcat[m]> the 'security' is largely just marketing
05:05:47 <DixieDean[m]> Didn't they get threatened with removal from markets
05:05:56 <DixieDean[m]> Mainly UAE, Russia and the UK
05:05:56 <strcat[m]> refraction: it barely got any support also
05:05:59 <refraction[m]> How about those without Android on it?
05:05:59 <DixieDean[m]> And they folded
05:06:15 <strcat[m]> refraction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Priv
05:06:21 <strcat[m]> it launched with Android 5.1 when Android 6 was out
05:06:24 <strcat[m]> and only got an upgrade to Android 6
05:07:06 <refraction[m]> Fair enough.
05:07:18 <DixieDean[m]> I was a major fan of blackberry.  Owned a lot of them.  Even tried my hardest to like the Z10
05:07:26 <thetranstocommie> I just looked it up tho: apparently even though they haven't released a phone running bb10 in 7 years, they'll still be giving out security updates through 2022.
05:07:27 <DixieDean[m]> But it was just a terrible device
05:07:35 <thetranstocommie> I respect the hell out of that commitment to updates
05:09:36 <DixieDean[m]> So just thinking out loud here but I have this idea of basically using a GrapheneOS phone.  Self hosting a matrix service.  And hosting a Wireguard/VPN on the same box.  And only exposing the synapse instance to tun0
05:09:46 <DixieDean[m]> So basically like a hacked together BES like setup
05:10:38 <DixieDean[m]> And just having a VPS running with bridged to all other services
05:11:00 <thetranstocommie> I respect that, but that almost sounds like a full time job maintaining something like that lol
05:11:21 <DixieDean[m]> Oh it's just stroking my autism lol
05:11:38 <DixieDean[m]> I just wanna know if i can do it  😂
05:12:58 <DixieDean[m]> i'm forced to use Slack for work, and now that it works with matrix.  i would disable federation in the .yaml.  and just use it as a practice instance.
05:13:11 <DixieDean[m]> * i'm forced to use Slack for work, and now that it works with matrix.  i would disable federation in the .yaml.  and just use it as a private instance.
05:15:10 <DixieDean[m]> i've been messing around with my own Synapse server, setup the TURN server and connected my Nexus 7 and my Graphene Pixel and for some reason they just refuse to call eachother.   Don't know what i'm doing wrong.   But yeah this is off-topic lol

05:26:12 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> My pixel 3 seems to have a problem with transfering data through usb, both external usb drives and connecting to pc seems to be not working. although charing works just fine. Could this be a software bug or is it definitly a hardware issue?
05:27:03 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> I'm afraid that i need to buy usb port replacement for this
05:27:49 <Chicomsstolemylu> <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m] "My pixel 3 seems to have a probl"> Have you tried different usb ports on your computer?
05:27:58 <Chicomsstolemylu> And different cables?

05:30:51 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> Can i tried different usb c dongles on external usb drives and they only show up in the notification center that it is charging the usb device
05:31:13 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> But doesn't show up in the files app

05:40:34 <strcat[m]> g2gy8ac2rcqn: USB issues are usually due to using bad cables
05:41:00 <strcat[m]> make sure to connect USB peripherals (drives, etc.) when the phone is unlocked or GrapheneOS ignores it
05:41:24 <strcat[m]> when connecting to a computer, the device defaults to charge only, you have to manually enable it acting as a USB peripheral itself in the notification - same as standard Android
05:44:38 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> this is what it looks like when i try to connect usb drive (fat32)

05:52:11 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> Yes i used the one that came with the phone
05:52:46 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> It seemed to work fine with different android devices..
05:57:55 <strcat[m]> did you plug it in when the device was unlocked?
05:58:03 <strcat[m]> and have you left the USB peripherals setting at the default?
06:03:57 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> If this is the default settings , yes

06:07:57 <strcat[m]> g2gy8ac2rcqn: that's not the setting I'm talking about
06:08:09 <strcat[m]> and as I explained above that has nothing to do with USB peripherals like connecting a flash drive
06:08:11 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> Changing 'usb controlled by' to this device doesnt work
06:08:17 <strcat[m]> you're going to need to read through what I said above
06:09:03 <strcat[m]> > did you plug it in when the device was unlocked?
06:10:04 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> Yes
06:10:26 <strcat[m]> the default is to allow connecting USB peripherals when unlocked
06:10:29 <strcat[m]> you may have changed that
06:10:32 <strcat[m]> look in Settings -> Security
06:10:37 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]>  Ah
06:10:55 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> I'm sure that is set to default

06:12:06 <strcat[m]> so that should be fine
06:12:23 <strcat[m]> I would try rebooting and maybe try another flash drive or another kind of USB peripheral like a keyboard / mouse
06:12:53 <strcat[m]> and make sure to use a high quality cable to connect it to a computer
06:12:57 <strcat[m]> ideally the cable the phone comes with
06:13:03 <strcat[m]> otherwise a high quality USB A to USB C cable
06:13:13 <strcat[m]> and turn on file transfer if that's the goal, after connecting it
06:15:39 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> The bundled usb c earphones do not work
06:16:50 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> I think this does make  things more clear
06:16:58 <strcat[m]> yes probably broken hardware
06:17:00 <strcat[m]> try a reboot though

06:26:56 <strcat[m]> shrug
06:27:49 <g2gy8ac2rcqn[m]> Ok .Thank you for your effort. I probably wasted some of your valuable time...

06:32:57 <DixieDean[m]> thinking about doing it myself lol for a learning experience
06:33:30 <strcat[m]> well on the positive side your screen is already broken and that's the main risk of opening it
06:37:44 <DixieDean[m]> Yeah, its the heating pad that looks a pain in the @ss  but aside form that its just 1 ribbon underneath
06:43:02 <DixieDean[m]> screw it, i'm just going to let the china man fix it tomorrow and then wait for Pixel 5 GOS support and then make the upgrade.

06:54:48 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, whoop.
06:54:54 <strcat[m]> app bugs should be reported to app developers
06:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> Gotcha.
06:55:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 5 grapheneos support will eventually come
06:55:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> But for now there's only unofficial builds being released by me
06:55:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've already said second week of February for those builds earlier
06:55:58 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you anupritaisno1[m]. Take what time you need.
06:57:19 <valldrac> TheJollyRoger: sorry, about what?
06:58:14 <TheJollyRoger> valldrac: oh, sorry, false alarm. I got confused between Session and Molly >_<.
06:58:26 <valldrac> TheJollyRoger: XDD
06:58:32 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, false alarm :P.
07:02:38 <somenerd[m]> lol
07:27:53 <pnrxa[m]1> <anupritaisno1[m] "But for now there's only unoffic"> How will updates work for these?
07:28:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> pnrxa: they won't
07:28:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Manual updates
07:28:56 <pnrxa[m]1> Ah makes sense
08:28:28 <take_a_deep_brea> when did we get 4a support ?
08:32:12 <take_a_deep_brea> i mean does anyone remember the date?

09:07:02 <creepingmenace[m> Thank you for your time gents.
09:08:21 <TheLoneWanderer[> Oh no
09:08:27 <TheLoneWanderer[> OH NO
09:09:20 <TheLoneWanderer[> On the bright side, you didn't hard brick the phone
09:09:30 <TheLoneWanderer[> Since you said you double clicked it
09:09:41 <creepingmenace[m> Nnothing happened.
09:09:54 <TheLoneWanderer[> That's a good thing
09:09:59 <creepingmenace[m> I plan on returning this I guess.
09:10:10 <TheLoneWanderer[> Otherwise it would've permanently bricked your phone
09:11:03 <somenerd[m]> shouldn't have followed those videos
09:11:11 <somenerd[m]> they're recommended against here
09:11:12 <TheLoneWanderer[> The phone still functions, right?
09:11:17 <strcat[m]> creepingmenace: don't follow those unofficial guides, they're dangerous
09:11:17 <creepingmenace[m> Yeah. This what I get for not following the videos.
09:11:21 <strcat[m]> and don't flash 4a release on the 4a 5G
09:12:45 <creepingmenace[m> The phone still works.
09:12:52 <TheLoneWanderer[> Great
09:13:14 <creepingmenace[m> It just restarted everything like it didn't happen.
09:13:31 <TheLoneWanderer[> Believe it or not that's a very good outcome
09:13:34 <strcat[m]> creepingmenace: it sounds like you unlocked it though?
09:13:39 <TheLoneWanderer[> Else you'd have a brick
09:13:59 <strcat[m]> anyway we don't support 4a 5G yet
09:14:04 <TheLoneWanderer[> Good thing you double clicked the flash all bat file
09:14:20 <TheLoneWanderer[> Instead of launching it in PS shell
09:14:35 <TheLoneWanderer[> Likely failed because fastboot wasn't in the path
09:14:36 <strcat[m]> we likely would support it by now if the project wasn't being attacked daily by an obsessed sociopath but it is what it is
09:14:42 <creepingmenace[m> I should've looked through the website more.
09:14:42 <creepingmenace[m> *facepalm*
09:14:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
09:14:57 <strcat[m]> is the installer
09:14:59 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
09:15:01 <strcat[m]> is the cli guide
09:15:08 <strcat[m]> shouldn't follow anything else, either one of those
09:15:13 <strcat[m]> but we don't support 4a 5G yet
09:15:15 <strcat[m]> 4a isn't the same thing
09:15:22 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
09:17:02 <creepingmenace[m> <strcat[m] "anyway we don't support 4a 5G ye"> "Yet"
09:19:17 <creepingmenace[m> Read it already. Should I keep my 4a 5G now for later or just return it?
09:46:52 <pikaman[m]> I just want to drop in and say that I am very thankful for the GrapheneOS project, and I am glad that I made the switch a few weeks ago!
09:59:52 <strcat[m]> creepingmenace: don't have a timeline for when it will be supported
09:59:53 <strcat[m]> could be a while
10:01:00 <fml128[m]> You could use calxy os in the meantime
10:07:12 <creepingmenace[m> <fml128[m] "You could use calxy os in the me"> Thanks a bunch man. Had no idea that there was another privacy OS.
10:23:38 <strcat[m]> fml128: they're not comparable projects and I would appreciate it if you didn't use our channel to advertise a project that has acted maliciously towards us
10:23:48 <strcat[m]> thanks
10:24:10 <strcat[m]> I recommend against using an OS from developers supporting harassment and spread misinformation about other projects
10:24:20 <strcat[m]>  * I recommend against using an OS from developers supporting harassment and spreading misinformation about other projects
10:25:24 <strcat[m]> it's a much different project not doing privacy or security hardening and depending heavily on Google services
10:26:21 <strcat[m]> and I think it's pretty misleading to direct people there just because it's based on AOSP too
10:47:37 <travankor> just curious, does grapheneos use ext4 of f2fs?
10:47:58 <strcat[m]> travankor: depends on device
10:48:02 <strcat[m]> we just use what AOSP does
10:48:36 <strcat[m]> the high-level OS images are ext4
10:48:41 <strcat[m]> userdata is either ext4 or f2fs
10:59:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> travankor: f2fs is used on userdata
10:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are reasons not to use it for the system partitions
11:01:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> First f2fs has a bit of a mount delay, many of the optimizations f2fs has are not really meaningful on read-only partitions and also f2fs needs a lot of space (around 100mb for the filesystem) which would actually result in wasting space on system partitions
11:01:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> It also doesn't play nicely with small partitions like metadata
11:01:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Which is why it only makes sense to use it for user data
11:05:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also f2fs mount can timeout and return -EAGAIN sometimes
11:05:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> This might mean it'd take several more seconds or even a minute before the system starts booting
11:05:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> This will most likely not happen because the filesystem wouldn't be mutable
11:07:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ext4 actually has a smaller space requirement for the filesystem itself and we use ext4 dedup in our builds so using ext4 actually writes less to your flash than f2fs would if you're concerned about that
11:08:09 <travankor> thanks guys for the explanation
11:08:40 <travankor> interesting that f2fs has so many caveats
11:09:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <travankor "interesting that f2fs has so man"> Not really
11:09:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is a good filesystem for storing userdata
11:10:15 <travankor> over ext4?
11:11:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
11:11:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just not good for storing the base system itself
11:12:26 <travankor> i got to say, though, ext4's fsck is really awesome it's saved me several times before
11:13:51 <travankor> and i think you can metadata checksums on the latest kernels
11:13:59 <travankor> use*
11:15:20 <travankor> (makes me wonder why no one's tried to use btrfs)
11:17:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> travankor: somebody did that
11:17:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Android does have support for mounting btrfs and even has selinux labels for it
11:17:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it's really useless
11:18:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> None of the fs options are user facing and you can't use checkpoints either
11:18:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> F2fs does support checkpoints so we could do a "system restore" feature if we wanted to through that
11:19:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do remember that doing such a thing will most likely result in data corruption if any user changes their password so we won't really implement this
11:19:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Do remember that doing such a thing will most likely result in data corruption if any user changes their password and then does a rollback so we won't really implement this
11:22:55 <travankor> I think it could work with subvolumes
11:24:31 <travankor> but i guess it depends on aosp to add the required knobs
11:25:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> travankor: it can't exactly
11:25:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's way more complex than that
11:35:16 <dakotah[m]> BTRFS android sounds dreadful

14:38:07 <noname> Hello guys, anyone have latest release for Pixel 1? (sailfish-factory-2019.10.07.21.zip)
14:41:11 <nscnt[m]> dez33: Are you using a VPN or have you set the restrictions for checking for updates in a way that your current connection type does not meet?
14:43:03 <fomijafi[m]> noname everything prior to  Pixel 3 is obsolete. https://grapheneos.org/releases. Upstream security patches are no longer being made for obsolete devices
14:43:36 <dez33> nscnt[m] no, I am not using VPN or have a set any other restrictions
14:44:47 <nscnt[m]> dez33: Your permitted networks in the system update settings is "Any"?
14:44:53 <dez33> yup
14:47:56 <COVID-1984> friend asking me if GOS got security / code review by third party... got an article I can send them?
14:48:05 <noname> fomijafi[m] yeah, i know it, but i have only pixel 1 at the moment, i don't care about upstream patches, because device will be often wiped, so, there's no any reason to deploy any exploits on my phone.
14:48:47 <somenerd[m]> > friend asking me if GOS got security / code review by third party... got an article I can send them?
14:48:47 <somenerd[m]> no, I don't believe so
14:49:03 <COVID-1984> ah i found one: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/c00a1h/why_should_one_trust_grapheneos_no_offense/
14:49:09 <somenerd[m]> since it builds off of AOSP, I assume that the majority of code is AOSP
14:49:11 <COVID-1984> that one suffices
14:49:22 <somenerd[m]> don't think that that's an audit
14:49:24 <somenerd[m]> but ok
14:50:37 <nscnt[m]> dez33: Mh, I don't know. I'm afraid I can't help you.
14:51:00 <fire_free[m]> Is it possible to share the sim data connection with a guest user?
14:51:16 <somenerd[m]> I think it's best to wait before asking again
14:51:23 <somenerd[m]> it's not that people aren't noticing
14:51:31 <somenerd[m]> maybe it's because they don't know

14:54:00 <somenerd[m]> check the link
14:54:08 <somenerd[m]> (could/should help)
14:54:30 <dez33> yep I've been reading that page
14:55:19 <nscnt[m]> fire_free: Your question isn't very specifiy. Do you actually refer to a guest account or just a secondary profile? When do you want to "share" it? At the same time? Or do you just want to use your mobile data in the guest (secondary?) profile when you're using the profile?
14:59:50 <fire_free[m]> nscnt: I would like to use the sim's lte data connection in a secondary profile. I read that using the "owner/principal" account as little as possible is the best thing to do for security. So I created a secondary account which is my personal and primary. The problem is that I'm just now realizing that I can't use the lte connection.
15:02:10 <fire_free[m]> Secondary account*
15:02:20 <nscnt[m]> You can use your mobile data
15:28:48 <penners[m]> Tethering is only possible in the owner account, if that's what you're referring to

15:32:34 <Hodge88> My first attempts at installing GOS, I was following the YT videos - which don't work. Would it benefit the project for me to make a YT video doing it the CORRECT way, exactly as the website prescribes? Because I'm a noob, and not much of a techie, I'd think I could produce a video most anybody could follow. Believe it or not, the command line
15:32:34 <Hodge88> installation procedure on the official installation page is rather overwhelming to the unitiated. My concern is, however, any video I make might become obsolete - and then become a distraction the same way the current vid's on YT are...
15:33:16 <Hodge88> Thoughts?
15:35:36 <StVM[m]> I am currently trying to follow the build guide, but got a little bit confuse. Is the tag name in repo init command is "RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.02.09" or something like "bramble".
15:37:55 <take_a_deep_brea> Hodge88: that's nice of you. but the problem with a video guide is that they are not friendly to changes in the installation instruction
15:41:48 <TheLoneWanderer[> <Hodge88 "installation procedure on the of"> You should try the web install. It's painless
15:43:41 <mintsauce[m]> i just read the web install page, wow, thats new! however it doesn't look like it will work. wondering if my browser extensions are blocking elements on the page
15:44:04 <mintsauce[m]> so i dont need to run a linux laptop just for graphene installs any more, my Mac OSX can do it? that would be very cool
15:48:19 <TheLoneWanderer[> It only requires a chromium based browser
15:49:41 <nscnt[m]> <StVM[m] "I am currently trying to follow "> RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.02.09 is the right thing

16:01:28 <faxing[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial
16:02:30 <dez33> I verified it back when I first flashed GrapheneOS on the device
16:02:39 <dez33> that was 6 or 7 months ago
16:02:48 <faxing[m]> try to verify once more now if possible
16:02:58 <dez33> i'm still in recovery mode
16:03:16 <faxing[m]> can't hurt and if it is a problem like that it can certainly figure it out quickly
16:03:17 <dez33> And it says my device might fail to boot since the installation failed
16:03:32 <faxing[m]> ah
16:03:49 <faxing[m]> you could reflash or take your chances and try to boot
16:03:52 <nscnt[m]> dez33: I don't think it should be an issue to boot your device.
16:04:28 <dez33> nscnt[m] ok 🤞
16:05:30 <hasnoname[m]> Hi, just wanted to understand if user profile end session switching to main profile is a change, since i don't find anything about it in changelog.
16:05:53 <nscnt[m]> hasnoname: No, that's how it has been all the time.
16:07:18 <dez33> ok rebooted ok
16:07:38 <nscnt[m]> dez33: If you tap "Check for updates" it checks (virtually) immediately if you haven't set any constraints. You wouldn't need to wait 4 hours.
16:08:24 <dez33> yeah there shouldn't be any constraints
16:08:30 <dez33> i've tapped that button a few times
16:12:30 <nscnt[m]> dez33: I can't figure out an answer as to why it might not work, sorry.
16:15:13 <faxing[m]> What's your build number
16:15:14 <dez33> nscnt[m] no worries.  thanks for trying
16:15:44 <faxing[m]> Settings -> About Phone -> Scroll to the bottom
16:16:11 <dez33> faxing[m] build number is  RQ1A.201205.003.2020.12.12.03

16:16:31 <faxing[m]> you're three updates behind
16:16:54 <dez33> yeah not sure why it hasn't auto updated.  it had been off for a while
16:17:04 <dez33> maybe that was a problem
16:17:11 <faxing[m]> oh it had been off?
16:17:28 <dez33> yeah it's a secondary device
16:17:29 <faxing[m]> I mean I don't see why that would have effected it but I don't see another reason why
16:17:39 <faxing[m]>  * I mean I don't see why that would have affected it but I don't see another reason why

16:18:14 <faxing[m]> just leave it on for a couple of hours
16:18:18 <faxing[m]> oh also
16:18:22 <faxing[m]> are you using NetGuard?
16:18:41 <dez33> not using NetGuard or any VPN on the device

16:18:49 <faxing[m]> Good
16:19:15 <faxing[m]> I was using NetGuard when I first got the phone and fucked my updates by unknowingly blocking the "Seamless Update Client"
16:19:28 <faxing[m]> So figured it couldn't hurt to check
16:19:44 <dez33> yeah worth checking
16:20:32 <faxing[m]> I mean certainly not technical but I'd just leave it on for a few hours and make sure it has a stable connection whole way through.
16:21:17 <dez33> yeah I left it overnight and nothing
16:23:06 <faxing[m]> Graphene sometimes kills wifi for me if the phone is off for a few hours straight, do you know if that happened to you?

16:23:38 <dez33> it could have but it still had connection when I checked this morning

16:29:21 <Hodge88> When I attempted install with the web-based installer, none of the buttons worked. It would cause a popup window with a message "trying to connect" or something, but it would error-out. This was on Brave browser. Tried it with shields "up" and "down".
16:32:47 <Anth> When I enter the command 'fastboot flashing unlock' it says < waiting for any device > but I'm not getting any prompt on my phone to unlock the bootloader

16:40:19 <Anth> thetranstocommie Yeah it's not coming back with any device info
16:42:27 <thetranstocommie> <Anth "the trans to commie pipeline Yea"> if you're on windows, this is probably a pretty easy fix.
16:42:35 <thetranstocommie> >On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot. You can

16:53:43 <kenkanaware[m]> Installed GrapheneOS for the first time. I fucking love it 😃

18:15:23 <dez33> @faxing[m] I can't get this thing verified or updated I think I'm going to just start with a fresh flash of GrapheneOS
18:15:55 <dez33> any idea of the webinstall will work if I'm on macOS Mojave?  I see the web install page mentions Big Sur
18:16:58 <deappledapple> <dez33 "any idea of the webinstall will "> Not sure, only way to know atm is to try it yourself
18:17:33 <dez33> deappledapple lol roger that
18:17:44 <dez33> guess I can always do cli install if it fails
19:13:22 <faxing[m]> <dez33 "@faxing[m] I can't get this thin"> Weird, there shouldn't be any problem with verification if it's a good install -- maybe that diagnoses the problem lol.
19:13:53 <faxing[m]> <dez33 "any idea of the webinstall will "> Theoretically speaking, there shouldn't be any obvious critical issue that would prevent it from flashing properly, but I don't use MacOS so don't quote me on it.
19:13:58 <faxing[m]> Let me know how it goes.
19:47:22 <dez33> faxing[m]  I'm back.  fresh flash things are working much better.  had to do CLI install web install would not work on Mojave.  I could never get it to recognize my device
19:47:40 <dez33> on latest version for Pixel 3a and things seem to be working better
19:50:20 <faxing[m]> Glad to hear it!
19:50:35 <faxing[m]>  * Glad to hear that you got it flashed and everything seems sorted!
19:51:51 <dez33> yeah.  only took almost a day to get it resolved but learned things.   I should probably focus on my actual work now LOL
19:52:27 <TheMadOne[m]> I'll try to install tomorrow via webinstaller. Hopefully it'll work
19:52:52 <DixieDean[m]> main issue i've had is the fastboot that ships with most distros is old
19:53:02 <DixieDean[m]> especially the debian or ubuntu one.
20:01:31 <majorasparagus0[> Dixie Dean: love the handle
20:02:35 <faxing[m]> <DixieDean[m] "especially the debian or ubuntu "> right.
20:03:26 <faxing[m]> When I used debian it was a nightmare -- like two and a half year old fastboot and well over a year old adb. I'd think they'd be the same age but apparently not)

20:24:11 <thetranstocommie> hey so, turns out a really important app I need to use doesn't work without google play services. i remember seeing some talk of having an offline stub or something along those lines to spoof google play services. how far along is that?
20:25:04 <thetranstocommie> the app itself launches and 90% works, but that 10% is crucial, and causes the app to crash.
20:48:51 <nullnode[m]> <thetranstocommie "hey so, turns out a really impor"> what is the app?
21:00:42 <DixieDean[m]> <majorasparagus0[ "Dixie Dean: love the handle"> You a fellow blue nose? lol
21:03:52 <thetranstocommie> <nullnode[m] "what is the app?"> fuck it. I was trying to avoid it, but it'd be a pretty bad bug report if I didn't lol
21:04:11 <thetranstocommie> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.MyLVHN.MyLVHN
21:04:43 <thetranstocommie> attempting to do a video call with a doctor crashes the app. wanted to know what the progress was on implementing any kind of stub
21:05:06 <DixieDean[m]> <faxing[m] "When I used debian it was a nigh"> its fine for a server which is really why Ubuntu is awful.  Debian was never intended to be a desktop OS.     I run a mix of Debian, QubesOS and Manjaro at home.
21:14:31 <nullnode[m]> <thetranstocommie "fuck it. I was trying to avoid i"> shit, ya sorry, probably not a good idea to post for location correlation reasons, I'm not sure what the best way around this would be, it most likely will not work fully without Google Play Services. The best route may be to reach out to the app developer or the organization and have notify them their apps implementation has restrictive accessibility issues when
21:14:31 <nullnode[m]> using a non Google device.
21:15:05 <nullnode[m]> If you check your system logs with adb you may be able to gain some more insight into what directly is failing to help the developer fix the app
21:17:57 <pnrxa[m]1> Dixie Dean: I've found debian testing okay on a desktop
21:19:33 <DixieDean[m]> <pnrxa[m]1 "Dixie Dean: I've found debian te"> Yeah testing isn't too bad.  And Ubuntu is still great for noobs
21:20:04 <DixieDean[m]> Its actually good if you are in a production environment and don't want to worry about lib and dependencies etc
21:22:39 <pnrxa[m]1> I've only ever used debian stable in production
21:27:25 <Hodge88> Was recently told anysoftkeyboard was a FOSS keyboard with swipe/gesture typing capability. I've installed it, but can't find anywhere to enable the swipe feature. Anyone know anything about this? Keying in each individual character is a YUGE bummer for me!

21:36:19 <DixieDean[m]> i like the stock keyboard, also like HackersKeyboard if you do any ssh, terminal work on your phone.
21:36:25 <DixieDean[m]> having ctrl, shift etc is a god send
21:40:14 <b1101> I miss having a hardware keyboard.
21:42:29 <DixieDean[m]> i'd love to see GrapheneOS on the Pro1-X
21:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dixie Dean: no
21:42:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's never happening
21:42:56 <DixieDean[m]> LOL
21:43:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> The pro1-x doesn't even pass CTS
21:43:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> We will never even consider it
21:43:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Is that the XDA phone?
21:43:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
21:43:40 <DixieDean[m]> Yeah i just like the format
21:43:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Phones that ship without gapps are bad news all the way
21:43:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> They don't do the necessary stuff to pass CTS
21:44:36 <rny> so they arent even android?
21:44:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also it's really dated hardware
21:44:38 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Isn't it also Snapdragon 835, does Qualcomm even support this?
21:44:38 <rny> lulz
21:45:03 <rny> android != gapps
21:45:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: they support devices for 6 years or so
21:45:21 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Wait...
21:45:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> It just means they keep releasing tags for android 5 for the next 6 years
21:45:23 <DixieDean[m]> man i miss Nokia N series lol
21:45:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Version upgrades stop in as little as 2 years
21:45:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: shipping those apps requires passing CTS, VTS and GTS
21:45:50 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <anupritaisno1[m] "Version upgrades stop in as litt"> I see
21:46:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Realize what happens when you skip all that and release trash
21:46:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: Google spends a lot of their own resources for a 3 year upgrade path

23:00:39 <Mruser42> hello
23:01:47 <Mruser42> Can somebody tell e which is the technical newest or best Phone that fully work with graphenOS
23:02:12 <Mruser42> i want bye a ne with focus in that point
23:02:16 <Mruser42> ?
23:03:00 <Thatcher[m]> <Mruser42 "Can somebody tell e which is the"> Pixel 4a

23:06:44 <Mruser42> desaster
23:06:48 <Mruser42> XD
23:07:47 <pnrxa[m]1> Troll?
23:08:29 <Hodge88> In fairness, I think it is indeed at LEAST ironic that a google device is most suitable for de-googling
23:09:00 <Hodge88> Plus, the fact the bootup splash screen still shows a google logo - shows there is googliness deeper in the system than the GOS can get to.
23:09:06 <Hodge88> That raises my eyebrow
23:10:23 <Hodge88> Donning my tinfoil hat: perhaps the NSA and CIA recruited google to create an attractive device for de-googling, to attract domestic terrorists and other bad actors to the device - but it has hidden back doors and software hooks to spy on its users more than even regular google!
23:10:27 <Hodge88> :-)
23:11:48 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <Hodge88 "Plus, the fact the bootup splash"> It's basically the same as the motherboard manufacturer logo on desktop at start up
23:12:43 <Hodge88> Yes, I know. My point is Daniel M would have replaced that with a sweet GOS logo, if he could get to it.
23:15:09 <neodyddlium[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Pixel 4a"> Of note, the 4 is water resistant, the 4a is not. The 855 chipset in the 4 is also a little better. Like new "open box" 128GB pixel 4s can be found for around 350 if you shop around.
23:15:25 <Mruser42> can somebody tell me whats the main point of the beed between James Donaldson and Daniel Micay

23:53:08 <ted_lavender[m]> Are certain carriers better than others? Or does Graphene OS limit what information carriers can obtain from the device such that it doesn't matter?
23:53:30 <rny> ted_lavender[m]: yes, some carriers are better than others. you need to do your own research
