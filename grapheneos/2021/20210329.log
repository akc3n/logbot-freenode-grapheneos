00:06:24 <aymswick> heyo. Noob here just bought a pixel 4a to try this out. I've installed successfully but don't seem to have fingerprint scanner support anywhere in the settings. During the setup splash screens, my fingerprint sensor didn't seem to work, so I skipped setting it up. Am I wrong in thinking fingerprint is allowed on pixel 4a (sunfish?)
00:12:55 <akc3n[m]> aymswick: In your app drawer, Settings, Security, then Fingerprint doesn't show up?
00:15:49 <strcat[m]> aymswick: it works fine, is this a new device or a used one?
00:16:38 <aymswick> akc3n[m] correct, not there. I used the web-based installer if that makes any difference
00:16:49 <aymswick> strcat[m] brand new, unlocked from google
00:17:37 <strcat[m]> aymswick: Settings -> Security -> Fingerprint
00:19:16 <aymswick> strcat[m]: yep not there. Wonder what I've done lol
00:19:30 <strcat[m]> are you sure this is a 4a?
00:19:41 <strcat[m]> Settings -> About phone
00:19:58 <aymswick> yep, model pixel 4a
00:20:51 <aymswick> I can try a reinstall, mostly just wanted to know if I was searching to enable a feature deemed too insecure for grapheneos (I know biometric locks are weakened by U.S. law)
00:24:03 <strcat[m]> no
00:24:06 <strcat[m]> it's not removed
00:24:15 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't make any sense for it to not be present unless the hardware is broken
00:24:57 <strcat[m]> if you actually installed GrapheneOS, and did it properly, then you have a locked device with all the firmware + OS images being verified
00:25:02 <strcat[m]> reinstalling won't change anything relevant
00:25:19 <aymswick> interesting. I don't think I even set up fingerprint via the stock os before installing GrapheneOS, so I suppose it is possible the fingerprint reader is broken
00:26:48 <aymswick> yep I've re-locked the device again, getting the "hey you're using a custom OS" message on boots. Seems everything is fine minus the fingerprint missing from settings. Anyway, thanks for your response, I'll try flashing stock and checking out the fingerprint reader. Would my follow-up and result be useful for ya?
00:30:14 <strcat[m]> aymswick: seems like broken hardware
00:30:27 <strcat[m]> aymswick: never seen that before, don't really need more info on it, not an OS issue
00:30:44 <aymswick> cool, thanks again
00:30:46 <strcat[m]> probably just need to get it replaced
00:30:50 <strcat[m]> can test with stock OS
00:30:57 <strcat[m]> never heard of that happening
00:38:57 <mr-president[m]> Heck yeah, just got GrapheneOS installed on my new Pixel 4a!
00:39:28 <akc3n[m]> mr-president: congrats and welcome!
00:47:49 <aymswick> haha perfect timing. Congrats mr. president. I assume your fingerprint sensor is working fine?
00:51:06 <skwisgaar[m]> aymswick: I don’t believe anyone in this group has ran into the issue you’re experiencing.
00:51:14 <mr-president[m]> idk man
00:51:19 <mr-president[m]> i havent checked
00:51:36 <mr-president[m]> and i have put up my phone for the night
01:26:22 <phone[m]> <aymswick "heyo. Noob here just bought a pi"> i don't use the fingerprint sensor, but i have a 4a and tested it with a fresh install from latest stable.  works fine.  as others said try recovering with stock android and test the sensor.  if it doesn't work then have the hardware checked.
02:28:43 <AppleSaucer98> Hi
03:06:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hello
05:14:39 <donkykong[m]> <aymswick "haha perfect timing. Congrats mr"> My 4a fingerprint works fine and was set up after gos install. Was your 4a a new device?
06:46:41 <sjsndnjdejd> Dell’s bios are garbage
06:47:02 <sjsndnjdejd> If I enable “wifi switch” on dell BIOS, laptop will wake to black screen from sleep.
06:47:02 <sjsndnjdejd> And the BIOS has a length limitation for boot parameters, that makes using EFISTUB impossible.
06:48:01 <IAAD> I am trying to unlock my bootloader of my phone with the Graphene web installer, but it shows "no compatible devices." I am unsure of what to do. I have my phone in the bootloader interface and it is plugged in.
06:52:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> IAAD: hello there, let me try to assist you
06:53:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> what is the operating system on the PC which you're using for the installation?
06:54:52 <IAAD> I am using windows 10.
06:55:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> good, are you using Google's original usb C which came with your phone?
06:55:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the cable i mean
06:55:53 <IAAD> I am using a usb c which came with another phone.
06:56:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> we highly recommend you to use the original cable, as fastboot is very "sensitive"
06:57:26 <IAAD> Oh wait, I was wrong. I am using the exact one that came with the pixel.
06:57:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, you should connect the phone directly to the motherboard (the ports on the back side of your PC)
06:58:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> without the use of any adapters
06:59:08 <stencil[m]> What's the ratio of irc:matrix:telegram participants?
07:01:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> there are currently ~214 humans on telegram group
07:01:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> how many people are on the Matrix group?
07:02:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> IAAD: you might be experiencing a problem with drivers
07:03:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> boot into fastboot mode and connect your phone to the PC
07:03:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> then run Windows Update, it will fix the driver issue
07:06:15 <IAAD> My phone came with a usb c to usb c and a usb c to usbh 2 adapter. I currently have my pixel plugged in with the adapter and a usb 2 connecting the adapter to the computer. Is that wrong?
07:06:41 <IAAD> And I did check for updates, which I just installed. Maybe I have to restart my computer?
07:08:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> IAAD: do you have a usb C port on your motherboard?
07:08:33 <IAAD> I do not.
07:10:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in this case, i recommend you to seek for a computer with a usb C port
07:10:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the adapter might work, but it is not guaranteed
07:11:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, a restart is a good thing
07:11:34 <IAAD> Was my pixel 4a suppose to come with a usb c to usb 2 cable?
07:12:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i don't own a 4a, but i think it only comes with usb c to c
07:13:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and maybe an adapter for file transfers
07:13:52 <IAAD> I will restart my computer, so I will be right back.
07:16:56 <IAAD> It's still not showing up.
07:17:48 <rahoon_goaway[m]> <IAAD "Was my pixel 4a suppose to come "> Nope, a C-C cable and C-A adapter
07:18:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> btw, is your phone OEM unclocked?
07:18:21 <IAAD> It is.
07:20:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, do you have an access to a computer with usb c port?
07:21:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> from the article: "You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports on a l
07:23:01 <IAAD> Might be something wrong with my u sb a to usb a cable. It is plugged in the back of my desktop.
07:24:01 <IAAD> I could check with someone else to see if they have a computer with a usb c port. I can't right at this moment. If they don't, that'd be a big inconvienence.
07:24:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, from your words it seems like you're using many adapters
07:24:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it should either be high quality single usb A to C cable
07:24:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or the original C to C
07:26:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sure, come back anytime!
07:26:36 <IAAD> Actually, I do have another android phone. I could try that.
07:27:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is it a pixel 3/4/5 tho?
07:27:43 <IAAD> pixel 4a 5g
07:27:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh ok, yes
07:28:01 <IAAD> Or the one i'm trying to flash is. Not the one i'm thinking about connecting to.
07:28:23 <IAAD> It's an s10e
07:28:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so, one is a 4a 5G, what is the other one?
07:28:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh, samsung s10e is not a GrapheneOS supported device
07:28:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do not attempt to flash it
07:29:19 <IAAD> I'm talking about running the web installer from the s10e
07:29:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh, idk, it might work
07:30:04 <nscnt[m]> It's also not officially supported
07:30:10 <nscnt[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ but might work
07:32:10 <nscnt[m]> It's only tested to flash from GrapheneOS supported devices
07:33:33 <IAAD> Ah, my s10e detected the pixel 4a 5g, and I was able to unlock the bootloader.
07:33:57 <IAAD> Thanks for the help.
07:36:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you are welcome! i hope the installation will go smoothly
08:22:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!K> Nice i want it to
09:11:37 <side_land> Until last night I was able to use face id with no problem to unlock my pixel 4 xl. This morning I notice that facial recognition was no longer working. So I decided to go into the settings to see about "fixing" it and I notice that the face id setting was reset as if I had never used it. But I've been using it for months with no problems. Is it normal for the OS to occasionally remove the face id settings on its own?
09:12:41 <side_land> Should I be concerned? Or is it normal?
09:13:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is not normal
09:13:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> tho, as a daily face id user, let me tell you
09:13:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you sometimes need to properly clean the IR sensor
09:14:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and most of a time the dust is not visible
09:14:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> now regarding your deleted face id, i guess that you've accidentally deleted it by entering the face id settings
09:14:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> tho i'm not 100% sure on that one
09:18:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, apparently there is a dedicated "DELETE FACE DATA" button
09:37:01 * came2complain[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SbWhiWgChlTSEzVHMurNTinP/message.txt >
09:37:13 <came2complain[m]> does anyone know what that is about?
09:38:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​ackintosh5WasTaken> your source code probably has a bunch of NULs in it
10:23:42 <came2complain[m]> it's the official graphene OS source
10:24:59 <side_land> I'm pretty sure it was the operating system that deleted my face id settings. should I report it as a bug? I'm scared that I have a compromised device. It's strange that the facial recognition is no longer working and the settings are being reset at any moment.
10:32:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> side_land: check your Auditor https://attestation.app/about
10:36:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, are you sure you set-up your face id properly AND in the corresponding user?
10:38:50 <rny> pls tell us how to reproduce
10:56:59 <side_land> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> also, are you sure you s"> Yes I'm sure of it. I'll try to use Auditor for security.
10:57:22 <side_land> I hope it was just a bug
11:14:54 <nscnt[m]> side_land: Whatever it was, you don't really have to worry about it
11:21:10 <gaylad> Hello, anyone know if its possible to add a wipemode on a grapheneOS phone
11:21:17 <gaylad> like if i loose my phone i can wipe it from my pc
11:21:20 <gaylad> is that possible
11:24:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> gaylad: hello, you should read/reread this section https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
11:30:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> remote wiping is an does not improve your security and only adds another attack vector
11:34:15 <gaylad> ¨Thanks!
11:34:21 <gaylad> will have that in ind
11:42:52 <dazinism> gaylad: its possible if you have a device manager app that provides that. But as Hulk says it has big security implications due to the massive privileges such apps have over the device.
11:43:02 <dazinism> They have more power than the user
11:43:06 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#WIPE_EUICC
14:04:25 <kkkasia[m]> Hello, you doesn’t support anymore Pixel 2, but is possible to install the latest version developed to that model??
14:08:49 <strcat[m]> yes
14:08:52 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 is insecure though
14:08:57 <strcat[m]> regardless of what you install on it
14:09:06 <strcat[m]> so only use it as a preview of the OS
14:09:27 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#taimen-stable
14:09:41 <strcat[m]> can see there are still extended support releases being made (which do not make it a secure device)
14:09:55 <pizzaeater69[m]> We provide extended support releases as a stopgap for users to transition to newer devices.
15:27:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​AN0PT1KON> Does GrapheneOS support eSIM？
15:28:22 <strcat[m]> no, we have yet to find a developer we can fund to work on implementing it
15:28:37 <strcat[m]> requires making an activation app
15:28:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​AN0PT1KON> Okay, thanks for answering
15:28:53 <strcat[m]> since the one in the stock OS is a Google app depending on Play services
15:29:11 <strcat[m]> and as part of device support, eSIM will need to be set up in the build configuration for each device
15:29:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​AN0PT1KON> O Fxxk
15:29:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​AN0PT1KON> Okay
15:29:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​AN0PT1KON> 🖥
15:29:26 <strcat[m]> 0 progress on it because we have yet to find a developer interested in being funded to work on it
15:29:34 <strcat[m]> and there are few volunteers doing anything
15:37:51 <ryanrambharose[7> when the device is in airplane/off can i be assured the radios are off?
15:42:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yes. If you could not, you would surely be looking for a new phone.
15:43:08 <strcat[m]> ryanrambharose: https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
15:43:15 <strcat[m]> ryanrambharose: there are separate toggles for the other radios
15:43:28 <strcat[m]> airplane mode forces cellular off + disables others but you can toggle the non-cellular ones back on
15:45:59 <ryanrambharose[7> thanks
16:30:10 <bikeman1234[m]> Hi, i just installed graphene on my pixel 4a and im wondering about the security when the screen is locked. Most phones with os like ios or android is not actually very safe in AFU mode (After first unlock) , many are not even encrypted until the phones is turned off, anyone know how graphene works regarding this?
16:31:03 <nscnt[m]> bikeman1234: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
16:32:42 <bikeman1234[m]> <nscnt[m] "bikeman1234: https://grapheneos."> Thanks for your answer but I have read that one and it doesn't really say anything about when the phone is actually encrypted
16:33:45 <PeterEaston> bikeman1234[m]: the phone is /always/ encrypted. At no point is anything not encrypted written to the drive.
16:34:21 <PeterEaston> GrapheneOS adds a "End Session" button to secondary user profiles to allow you to eject the keys from memory on those profiles when they are not in use.
16:35:47 <PeterEaston> As stated in the third paragraph:
16:35:53 <PeterEaston> > "Full disk encryption is implemented via filesystem-based encryption with metadata encryption. All data, file names and other metadata is always stored encrypted."
16:36:44 <PeterEaston> Again, emphasis on "All data, file names, and other metadata is always stored encrypted."
16:37:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​am090421> Buenos días/Good Morning
16:37:30 <PeterEaston> Ahoy!
16:38:01 <bikeman1234[m]> So, when my screen is locked, there is no way anyone , thieves, law enforcement or even cellebrite can access any information?
16:38:25 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: When you hit "End Session" in a secondary profile, for that profile, yes.
16:38:31 <TheJollyRoger> They will need the password.
16:38:52 <TheJollyRoger> From the same entry:
16:38:57 <TheJollyRoger> > "Our recommendation for a high security setup is to use the owner profile only for managing other profiles. Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device."
16:39:16 <dannyknoll3Danny> <TheJollyRoger "They will need the password."> How resistant are these to de-cap?
16:40:01 <bikeman1234[m]> <TheJollyRoger "> "Our recommendation for a high"> ok so the owner profile is not very secure unless it is in BFU mode?
16:40:22 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: If you're worried about the chip being decapitated, then GrapheneOS supports passphrases of up to 64 characters in length, which should add adequate security in the event the security chip is compromised.
16:41:01 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: If you're under that threat model, then do not store anything in the Owner profile, simply use it to manage other profiles.
16:41:17 <TheJollyRoger> Apps are always sandboxed, at all times, to the fullest extent possible.
16:41:21 <TheJollyRoger> Regardless of what profile you use.
16:41:34 <dannyknoll3Danny> TheJollyRoger 😎👍 This is why I subscribe. Hope your day's going better than mine, TJR!
16:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> So, "not very secure" is extremely vague.
16:41:42 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: yarr!
16:43:24 <bikeman1234[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So, "not very secure" is extreme"> What i mean is, there is a difference in security between BFU and AFU
16:45:27 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: for the owner profile, there is a difference; the keys for the owner profile must reside in the phone's memory so the phone can get at certain system files, which are needed for the device to operate.
16:45:57 <TheJollyRoger> For any secondary profiles, simply hit the "end session" button and that returns that profile to "before first unlock" state.
16:46:49 <TheJollyRoger> "End Session" is exclusive to GrapheneOS, and is not seen on the factory operating system or any other third-party operating systems, to my knowledge.
16:47:44 <bikeman1234[m]> ok, so while in AFU it's possible for someone with access to let say cellebrites tools to access data without the passcode?
16:48:48 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: As I said before, if you hit "end session" on the secondary profile, the keys will no longer exist in memory, and therefore won't be obtainable without the passcode.
16:49:01 <TheJollyRoger> For the owner profile, the equivalent is switching your phone off.
16:49:25 <TheJollyRoger> Even in the case of a hypothetical exploit, or a physical delidding/coldboot attack.
16:49:46 <TheJollyRoger> Again, use profiles. That's what GrapheneOS has them for.
16:49:48 <bikeman1234[m]> Ok, thank you for your answers:)
16:50:46 <TheJollyRoger> Profiles not only can be placed at rest when they and the apps in them are not in use, but each one comes with its own contact list, its own contextual workspace, its own shared storage space, and interprocess communication across profiles is blocked.
16:50:58 <TheJollyRoger> They have their own encryption keys, even.
16:51:50 <TheJollyRoger> The only thing they share is the app versioning (you cannot downgrade or install older versions of apps in a different profile. Upgrading one, upgrades them all)
16:52:17 <TheJollyRoger> This share-nothing arrangement allows you to maintain different and disparate contextual identities on the same device.
16:52:43 <TheJollyRoger> And to place at rest or even securely delete them when they are not in use and no longer needed.
16:53:09 <skwisgaar[m]> Worth noting that if your phone is in the AFU state, an attacker would still need an exploit to access the keys in memory. They can’t just plug your phone into a computer and extract the memory.
16:53:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Thanks, skwisgaar[m]!
16:54:25 <bikeman1234[m]> https://www.cellebrite.com/en/cas-supported-devices/
16:54:33 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: It's worthy to note that Cellebrite and other UFED (Universal Forensics Extraction Devices) require either the password or an exploit. The device simply being supported by them isn't interesting, since they present a guided way to use ADB for nontechnical people.
16:54:54 <TheJollyRoger> For devices that DO offer a lockscreen bypass, they require the use of a canned exploit, which is *precisely why* you need to keep up to date.
16:55:26 <skwisgaar[m]> Sure! I remember being worried about that in the past, because so many (poorly written/researched) articles out there imply that AFU means your phone is completely vulnerable to anyone with a USB cable
16:55:30 <TheJollyRoger> Simply put, they're a packaged way to use an existing exploit.
16:55:42 <bikeman1234[m]> Here cellebrite claims to be able to extract data from pixels up to pixel 4 in AFU without the password, but grapheneOS is probably doing something about that, right?
16:55:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. There's so much Fear/Uncertainty/Doubt and fearmongering
16:56:17 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: cellebrite claims they were able to decrypt Signal Messages. What they didn't claim, was that it required the device to be unlocked and you to open the app.
16:56:34 <TheJollyRoger> *what a lot of people going "SIGNAL IS CRACKED IT'S ALL OVER" now didn't realize was that it required the device
16:57:21 <skwisgaar[m]> Cellebrite marketing is full of bullshit
16:57:41 <TheJollyRoger> These types of misleading/false reports typically end up being reposted in privacy enthusiast echo chambers with zero questioning and then accepted by enough people who don't know any better then accepted as fact.
16:57:43 <jake_001[m]> Doesn't matter how secure the door is if you can sell everyone on the idea its tissue paper
16:58:19 <bikeman1234[m]> <TheJollyRoger "bikeman1234: cellebrite claims t"> Yeah i realize they probably not superhonest, but I have seen police reports where the police in my country opens LOTS off iphones even iphone 11
16:58:28 <bikeman1234[m]> with cellebrite that is
16:58:46 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: then if you want an ironclad guarantee, then use an EFF diceware password, use secondary profiles, and hit "End Session" when the profile is not in use.
16:58:48 <TheJollyRoger> Problem solved.
16:59:46 <TheJollyRoger> Then just don't keep anything in the owner profile. Use an instant messaging application which offers end to end encryption and transport encryption, like Signal to communicate.
17:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS adds the "End Session" button *for this specific reason*.
17:00:10 <TheJollyRoger> So use it.
17:01:11 <bikeman1234[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Problem solved."> got it,thanks for the help:)
17:01:38 <TheJollyRoger> You asked what GrapheneOS is doing about this threat vector, there's the solution: End Session ejects the keys from memory so they won't be living on the phone when the laboratory applies the liquid nitrogen to do a cold imaging attack.
17:01:46 <legroslulu[m]> TheJollyRoger: Hello again, I was able to unlock my phone in fastboot yesterday. The cable and the adapter wasn't the issue. In device manager, I only saw "Pixel 4a" so I updated that driver from this link: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb After that "Pixel 4a" was replaced with "Andoid Bootloader Interface". Thanks to your advice, I was able to get the driver working properly. After that I was able
17:01:47 <legroslulu[m]> to flash the system properly from the web client.
17:02:00 <TheJollyRoger> legroslulu[m]: Great to hear!
17:02:14 <TheJollyRoger> legroslulu[m]: welcome aboard the ship :)
17:02:21 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, forgot the eyepatch:
17:02:26 <TheJollyRoger> P.-)
17:02:58 <legroslulu[m]> It's nice to actually be able to use it instead of reading about it!
17:03:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
17:06:32 <TheJollyRoger> Gotta go for a bit, I will return shortly shipmates!
18:18:12 <m2tu[m]> Does anyone know how i can make darktheme standard when i do build ?
18:18:55 <m2tu[m]> cant find where to change the values
18:24:46 <bikeman1234[m]> is it possible to stop access to SMS&call for the owner profile so that incoming calls&sms only goes to other profiles?
18:42:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> bikeman[m]: afaik, a simple answer is no
18:55:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> g​ochoingles shared a file (video/mp4) on Telegram with title: 'mp4.mp4'.
19:06:42 <entry1[m]> Can't view attachments across the bridge @gochingles
19:08:30 <Torserversrcool> Hi
19:08:43 <Torserversrcool> Graphene OS should used Hardcoded, static HTTPS/TLS/SSL Certs when updating to the update server
19:08:50 <Torserversrcool> To prevent MITM Cert replacement
19:08:52 <Torserversrcool> DANE, etc
19:09:53 <entry1[m]> What does it currently use Torserversrcool
19:10:06 <Torserversrcool> I havent looked or asked before
19:10:08 <Torserversrcool> Thats why Im asking now
19:10:19 <Torserversrcool> I just know that HTTPS Certs can be spoofed/ etc
19:10:25 <Torserversrcool> Thats why a Hardcoded Cert is important
19:12:15 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: the verified boot keys are permanent. The update server is not a trusted third party.
19:12:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> If an update is tampered with, Verified Boot will not let the device start.
19:12:50 <Torserversrcool> The update server should be trusted
19:12:56 <Torserversrcool> Its hosting the OS update code
19:13:00 <Torserversrcool> Alright
19:13:08 <Torserversrcool>  I think the update server should be more secured
19:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: Even if there was a way to do it, there would be effectively zero security gains in doing so, because calls and texts made over the publicly switched telephone network are public.
19:13:24 <Torserversrcool> thats a seperate tpic
19:13:26 <Torserversrcool> topic
19:13:48 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: please read the following: https://grapheneos.org/features#services
19:13:52 <Torserversrcool> If the NSA can MITM the HTTPS Cert in between the GOS phone and the update server, spoof the HTTPS Cert, and implant a Backdoored binary
19:14:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Qubes OS has the same "do not trust the infrastructure" method. They use GPG. Verified Boot is something similar, that is why the Verified Boot keys are changed when installing GrapheneOS ─ so they are Graphene's not the stock ROM's.
19:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: if that happened your phone would not accept them.
19:14:13 <Torserversrcool> Then the GOS phone would happily install a backdoored GOS update
19:14:18 <Torserversrcool> \How does the phone know
19:14:26 <Torserversrcool> If the update has backdoored exploit code..?
19:14:38 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: Updates are signed and verified against Android Verified boot, end to end.
19:14:46 <Torserversrcool> hmm ok
19:14:54 <Torserversrcool> But cant the NSA backdoor the update files
19:14:54 <TheJollyRoger> *signed and verified against a public key which is provisioned at install time, using Verified boot.
19:14:57 <TheJollyRoger> No.
19:14:59 <Torserversrcool> On the server
19:15:03 <TheJollyRoger> Because if they did, your phone would not accept them.
19:15:07 <Torserversrcool> On the update server, which is probably a KVM VPS
19:15:16 <TheJollyRoger> If an adversary changed *one bit* of the update image, your phone would detect it as invalid.
19:15:23 <Torserversrcool> What if the NSA hacks the Update server VPS, and signs their backdoored verison
19:15:24 <TheJollyRoger> Because it's digitally signed and verified.
19:15:32 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: they can't do that, because the keys don't live there.
19:15:37 <Torserversrcool> Ok nice
19:15:45 <TheJollyRoger> The keys live offline on the lead developer's secure infrastructure.
19:15:50 <Torserversrcool> Are the updates Signed on the Admins computer, and then uploaded to the Update server?
19:16:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Torserversrcool: Verified Boot prevents the phone from starting up to prevent any further security damage.
19:16:05 <Torserversrcool> Hopefully so
19:16:18 <fakhx[m]> @freenode_BamBamBigYellow:matrix.org: Lupita  did you manage to get exfat/ntfs usd/hdd to work with grapheneos ?
19:16:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Torserversrcool: So if NSA catches your phone, they definitely will not get access to the files.
19:16:24 <Torserversrcool> Yes but the phone probably cant detect if a maliscous update is installed
19:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, the keys live in a secure environment, and they don't leave.
19:16:34 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: yes, it can, because of Verified boot.
19:16:35 <Torserversrcool> Ok but
19:16:40 <Torserversrcool> ...
19:16:44 <TheJollyRoger> This is where auditor and remote attestation comes in.
19:16:48 <TheJollyRoger> https://attestation.app/tutorial
19:16:50 <Torserversrcool> My point is, the NSA can Sign a Backdoored Update with the same keys
19:16:59 <TheJollyRoger> Torserversrcool: Are you just trolling?
19:17:02 <Torserversrcool> no
19:17:06 <Torserversrcool> Im being 100% serious
19:17:10 <TheJollyRoger> Because you're not listening.
19:17:15 <Torserversrcool> The NSA can backdoor an Update
19:17:17 <Torserversrcool> Sign it
19:17:20 <Torserversrcool> Then the phone installs it
19:17:37 <TheJollyRoger> They would need the exact private keys that live in the lead developer's secure environment to sign it as legitimate.
19:17:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Torserversrcool: Not easy. These keys are really strong.
19:17:51 <TheJollyRoger> Those exact keys are securely generated and are of >128 bit strength.
19:17:53 <Torserversrcool> what is the keysize of the keys?
19:17:54 <nscnt[m]> They can't. It has been explained already
19:17:56 <Torserversrcool> ok
19:18:05 <Torserversrcool> >128 bit = pass =)
19:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> So they would need to break encryption in order to forge update.
19:18:24 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1177, I know it's you.
19:18:29 <TheJollyRoger> Quit it.
19:18:37 <TheJollyRoger> I've explained this to you before.
19:19:24 <Torserversrcool> Its a legitimate question
19:19:29 <Torserversrcool> Its dangerous to assume, thats why I ask
19:19:35 <Torserversrcool> So I can become enlightened
19:19:38 <nscnt[m]> You are making false statements again and again
19:19:39 <Torserversrcool> Thank you TJR.
19:19:45 <Torserversrcool> What false statement did I make
19:19:47 <Torserversrcool> ?
19:19:57 <Torserversrcool> All I did was ask questions
19:20:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Torserversrcool: Not really.
19:20:15 <TheJollyRoger> Pick one nickname and stick with it.
19:20:21 <nscnt[m]> The NSA can backdoor an Update Sign it Then the phone installs it
19:20:30 <Torserversrcool> Yeah, if they hack the Private keys
19:20:34 <TheJollyRoger> I've asked you to do this many time repeatedly.
19:20:36 <Torserversrcool> Or Admins PC
19:20:37 <TheJollyRoger> *many times
19:20:49 <Torserversrcool> Im just another anoynmous user on the WWW
19:21:25 <hollowatom> hello!
19:21:47 <hollowatom> Is there app people use when they lost their phone to find it?
19:21:52 <TheJollyRoger> Adam1177/Torserversrcool, we have an appeal process in place. You keep evading it with VPNs, and been asked not to return. This is very disrespectful.
19:22:03 <Torserversrcool> Im just asking about security features
19:22:10 <TheJollyRoger> hollowatom: Ahoy! At this moment, we don't have a "find my phone" app for GrapheneOS.
19:22:12 <hollowatom> I am about to put workspace one on this thing, i keep losing it..
19:22:27 <hollowatom> is there anything similar?
19:22:48 <TheJollyRoger> hollowatom: Not that the project officially recommends.
19:22:52 <Torserversrcool> I'd advice against remote tracking software
19:22:52 <hollowatom> I will have to get a old chain wallet and bolt it to me... :)
19:23:14 <TheJollyRoger> hollowatom: heh, that might work.
19:23:22 <hollowatom> I am my workspace one admin
19:23:29 <hollowatom> so i would be tracking myself... lol
19:23:50 <hollowatom> i am surprised waze works.
19:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> hollowatom: Yeah, if apps aren't written by their authors to be dependent on GSF, and have no fallback in place for when GSF is absent, then they'll run.
19:26:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I have heard of some kind of "find my phone" program that works over SMS. It is called FindMyDevice and it can be found on F-Droid.
19:26:35 <hollowatom> I got it
19:26:41 <hollowatom> I guess i am too dumb to use it
19:31:44 <Eddy[m]> any reason why i cant uninstall some of the grapheneos default apps i.e vanadium
19:31:45 <Eddy[m]> does anyone know
19:34:14 <entry1[m]> <Eddy[m] "any reason why i cant uninstall "> OS system apps can be disabled if you'd like, but you can't uninstall them.
19:35:00 <entry1[m]> That provides to all Android-like OS's as well.
19:36:24 <Eddy[m]> i mean \
19:36:33 <Eddy[m]> does lineage os have the same limitations
19:36:34 <Eddy[m]> i mean
19:36:37 <Eddy[m]> i think they let you root
19:36:44 <Eddy[m]> its at the cost of security but still
19:36:45 <Eddy[m]> root
19:38:09 <entry1[m]> Ed dy  GrapheneOS does not support rooting the device for that reason specifically. It has a strict permission model that values security and allowing root would go against the project's mission
19:38:12 <billinmtl[m]>  I have a few questions about additional users, post here - or is that considered off topic ?
19:38:33 <entry1[m]> Disabling an app removes all of its permissions
19:39:57 <entry1[m]> <billinmtl[m] " I have a few questions about ad"> I know the logs have a ton of info on that subject in this room and the #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org have u tried them first? If you can't find it, I'm sure it would be appropriate to ask in either room as it is a built in functionality in the OS
19:40:22 <hollowatom> I have used lucky patcher to srip depedencies before to get some apps to work
19:40:34 <billinmtl[m]> Yep, did search - but will go back and search more I guess - thanks
19:41:20 <entry1[m]> <billinmtl[m] "Yep, did search - but will go ba"> I may know the answer or be able to find it, what's the question?
19:51:40 <billinmtl[m]> I've set up a second user and plan to have the main user to manage the other for now.  If I end the session from the lock screen, that closes the second user, correct ?  Do I need to set up a password to get back into that second user - or just switch from the settings of the main user ?
19:57:12 <entry1[m]> Correct, ending the session is a feature for a secondary user. In order to have access to the secondary user, you must login to the owner profile. Once you end session, you are reverted back to sign into the owner profile.
19:57:14 <Ted18> Hi. How can I transfer my contacts from my old phone to my new?(without doing it by hand)?
19:57:19 <entry1[m]> bill.in.mtl
19:57:55 <entry1[m]> <Ted18 "Hi. How can I transfer my contac"> Export then as vcf files and bring them over to the new phone. That's your best bet
20:00:29 <skwisgaar[m]> bill.in.mtl: if you don’t set up a password for the secondary profile, anybody could pick up your phone and open the secondary profile if you have already unlocked the owner profile
20:01:12 <skwisgaar[m]> If the owner profile hasn’t been unlocked yet, all secondary profiles are off limits
20:01:17 <billinmtl[m]> is that password set up in a special place - or just in settings like a pin code, etc ?
20:01:39 <skwisgaar[m]> It’s the same as the main profile, so yes in the settings menu
20:01:56 <skwisgaar[m]> You can set up fingerprints for secondary profiles too if you want
20:02:00 <skwisgaar[m]> Or face unlock
20:02:03 <entry1[m]> Can be up to 64 characters for any profile
20:02:08 <billinmtl[m]> perfect, thanks - that was the info I could not track down - cheers!
20:02:22 <skwisgaar[m]> Sure thing :)
20:07:49 <Ted18> ty
20:36:43 <Clutchward> I know graphene doesn't support any on the market tablets, and I understand why ... ish... but are there any tablets anyone would suggest or are they all terrible?
20:37:33 <entry1[m]> <Clutchward "I know graphene doesn't support "> You are probably going to be suggested an iPad by members here.
20:37:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Clutchward: depends on your preferences, and this off-topic
20:37:59 <Clutchward> ipad lel
20:38:05 <Clutchward> I'd rather burn my house down
20:38:13 <Clutchward> okay sorry ill be done
20:38:17 <strcat[m]> it's off-topic for this channel
20:38:21 <entry1[m]> My bad, I thought this was OT chat
21:17:06 <Xcutioner[m]> Has anyone gotten the Yubico Authenticator to work with GrapheneOS either via USBC or NFC?
21:34:23 <tsc[m]> <Xcutioner[m] "Has anyone gotten the Yubico Aut"> It works good
22:29:54 <Xcutioner[m]> t.s.c: which YubiKey do you use and did you get the app on Fdroid?
22:31:17 <tsc[m]> <Xcutioner[m] "t.s.c: which YubiKey do you use "> it should be yubikey 5
22:31:29 <tsc[m]> yes it is from fdroid
22:32:06 <Xcutioner[m]> t.s.c: Thanks
22:33:06 <tsc[m]> <Xcutioner[m] "t.s.c: Thanks"> 🙂
