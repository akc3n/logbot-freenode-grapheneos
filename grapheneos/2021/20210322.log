00:02:21 <ulmirdin[m]> I believe this is an AOSP issue, not GrapheneOS.
00:10:24 <akc3n[m]> <Jgem[m] "Sorry if this is just not consid"> I believe this is an upstream bug issue.
00:12:50 <akc3n[m]> <klarkkable[m] "who's the contact point for join"> TheJollyRoger has a testing chat channel setup for this.
00:32:20 <uhsa> hello, i received an update a couple hours ago and now signal keeps displaying a notification: ''Background connection enabled''  is there a way to delete it?
00:33:11 <ulmirdin[m]> Long press -> Turn off notification
00:34:01 <uhsa> ulmirdin[m] Does this turn off all of signals notification or just this one?
00:34:40 <ulmirdin[m]> You can toggle individual notifications in the settings for the app.
00:34:51 <uhsa> I see it now i toffled off only other notifications
00:34:55 <uhsa> toggled*
00:40:06 <uhsa> I know adding add-ons to vanadium makes it more identyfiable, but how about security if i add noscript or ublock for example does it add to the security of vanadium?
00:51:28 <grapheneos_user_> <uhsa "I know adding add-ons to vanadiu"> Ublock no, noscript, you can already disable javascript
00:52:24 <grapheneos_user_> I think
00:53:41 <grapheneos_user_> Disabling JavaScript makes mobile web almost unusable anyway
00:53:47 <Preload[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "I think"> Yeah, JavaScript can be disabled by default (at least in bromite).
00:54:24 <uhsa> Yes thats why my question with the noscript addon you can toggle wich scripts to allow for some functionality
00:54:52 <grapheneos_user_> <uhsa "Yes thats why my question with t"> Can already make exceptions to disabling JavaScript
00:55:15 <Preload[m]> Then JS can be manually turned on on a case by case basis for each website.
00:56:02 <grapheneos_user_> If a site is malicious, any of its scripts could be malicious
00:56:40 <grapheneos_user_> So not very useful to enable script by script
00:59:26 <uhsa> grapheneos_user_  would a malicious script be able to leave the sandbox?
01:00:40 <Preload[m]> <uhsa "grapheneos_user_pi  would a mali"> Script from the browser?
01:02:10 <uhsa> Preload[m] Is it the same as in vanadium where you have to go to Settings -> Site settings -> Javascript to add an exception? or is it more accesible like noscript in the add on menu
01:02:17 <uhsa> Yes from the browser
01:03:30 <Preload[m]> Highly unlikely for a secure and hardened sandbox. However, there are sandbox escapes from the browser before on both iOS and Android in general, so not impossible. Correct me if I'm wrong.
01:04:55 <grapheneos_user_> <uhsa "grapheneos_user_pi  would a mali"> If there is a sandbox escape vulnerability, yes
01:06:04 <strcat> uhsa: Signal always has that notification, that's part of it running a foreground service to reliably remain active in the background
01:06:09 <strcat> nothing to do with an update
01:06:41 <uhsa> strcat i didnt until today i have been using signal for a couple days now
01:06:55 <strcat> you didn't notice, but it always does that
01:07:00 <strcat> it's a silent low priority notification
01:07:07 <strcat> it doesn't appear unless you expand it at the bottom of the tray
01:07:13 <strcat> doesn't show up on lockscreen, in status bar, etc.
01:07:17 <strcat> since it's low prio + silent
01:07:32 <strcat> but it would have been there
01:07:44 <Preload[m]> <uhsa "Preload Is it the same as in van"> Yes, that's the page.
01:09:46 <uhsa> strcat[m]  No really it wasnt there i would have noticed right now i disabled the ''other'' notifications in the signal notifications now it doesnt show it anymore, would you happen to now what else falls under that category of ''other'' notifications?
01:10:39 <uhsa> And this time it did show up on the lockscreen thats why i disabled it
01:13:52 <Preload[m]> I think you can tap on the info icon from the menu to access per site permissions. I can't be sure as I don't use Vanadium, unfortunately. I think Bromide has a patch that presents an option for JavaScript on the permissions page for each website, allowing for easier access.
01:14:56 <Preload[m]> So, I'm afraid that's the only way to access that setting.
01:15:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Added jj1013 again
01:15:09 <strcat[m]> uhsa: disabling it may have consequences
01:15:18 <strcat[m]> uhsa: and it was there, and isn't something tied to the update...
01:15:26 <strcat[m]> uhsa: it's there for everyone using Signal without Play services
01:15:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: pm
01:15:32 <strcat[m]> uhsa: it's how it runs in the background
01:16:39 <strcat[m]> uhsa: it isn't meant to be very noticeable, no icon in status bar, nothing on lockscreen, only visible as a folded notification at the bottom
01:16:48 <strcat[m]> unless you pressed it to expand it, wouldn't have been shown like a normal notification
01:19:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Btw doing a cleanup rn
01:20:14 <Preload[m]> <strcat[m] "uhsa: it's there for everyone us"> Yup, uhsa , that notification keeps Signal alive to receive notifications. You can prevent it from appearing on the lock screen by adjusting its settings. It is essential for background notifications on a phone without Google Play Services.
01:20:51 <uhsa> strcat[m]  no really it did i just tried again enabled the ''other'' notifications and rebooted my phone and there it was again in the status bar and also on the lock screen now without me pressing on it
01:21:29 <uhsa> Doesnt it appear on the lock screen for you?
01:22:06 <uhsa> could it be that i have those silent notifications enabled where could i find that?
01:22:29 <ulmirdin[m]> <Preload[m] "Yup, uhsa , that notification ke"> Does the notification itself keep it running in the background? I wouldn't think turning off a notification would terminate background connection.
01:22:34 <strcat[m]> uhsa: it's silent by default unless you changed it
01:22:57 <strcat[m]> uhsa: you must have changed the notification channel settings
01:23:01 <Preload[m]> It is meant to be as unobtrusive as possible by using Gentle Notifications. However, at least from my phone, sometimes it shows on the lock screen.
01:24:17 <uhsa> The notifications on lock screen setting for me is at:  Show conversations, default, and silent
01:24:59 <strcat[m]> I'm not talking about settings for the lock screen but rather the notification settings for the Signal notification channel
01:25:25 <strcat[m]> it always has that notification when Play services isn't present, it's not a normal notification but rather a persistent one for the foreground service
01:25:34 <strcat[m]> it's not new and has nothing to do with an update to GrapheneOS
01:25:56 <strcat[m]> it's an Android thing, and a Signal thing
01:26:08 <strcat[m]> foreground services are a common way to do stuff in the background
01:26:38 <strcat[m]> and Signal has to keep a service running to maintain the connection to their server, which they use to push notices of new messages being available to the app
01:26:51 <strcat[m]> it would be possible for it to be smarter about how it does it but this is what they do
01:27:47 <uhsa> strcat[m] I know what you mean it is needed for signal to run without play services, however for me as does for Preload it does show up in status bar and on the lockscreen. Thats why i wanted to turn it off and i found by turning off the ''other'' signal notifications it dissapeared. But all i would like to know is what kind of ''other''
01:27:47 <uhsa> notifications does signal mean it doesnt specify?
01:28:27 <Preload[m]> * It is meant to be as unobtrusive as possible by using Gentle Notifications. However, at least on my phone, sometimes it shows on the lock screen.
01:28:44 <strcat[m]> uhsa: Signal names those channels
01:28:47 <strcat[m]> (the app names them)
01:28:50 <ulmirdin[m]> Other is the background connection notification only, I haven't gotten anything different.
01:28:51 <strcat[m]> so that's what they chose to call it
01:29:04 <Preload[m]> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background
01:29:21 <uhsa> Would i miss something important or could i leave it off as to not see the notification, wich i promise you shows up i am not hallucinating:P
01:29:41 <Preload[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services
01:29:47 <uhsa> ulmirdin[m] so you experienced the same issue?
01:30:05 <ulmirdin[m]> uhsa: it's not an issue, rather it's just how it works
01:30:25 <uhsa> yes excuse me that is what i meant
01:30:45 <ulmirdin[m]> It's the same for everyone.
01:30:49 <strcat[m]> the only issue would be if you changed it from silent, etc.
01:31:40 <Preload[m]> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background#services
01:33:35 <uhsa> strcat[m]  I dont think i changed it where would it be? Is it the Hide silent notifications in the status bar in the notification settings that is turned off for me
01:34:46 <strcat[m]> it's set to the lowest possible priority already
01:34:47 <ulmirdin[m]> Wanna continue the conversation at #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ? I don't think it's relevant to GrapheneOS
01:34:48 <strcat[m]> by Signal
01:34:57 <strcat[m]> but you can change that, and it sounds like you might have
01:35:06 <uhsa> Settings -> Apps&Notifications -> Notifications -> Advanced -> Hide silent notifications in status bar is off
01:36:16 <uhsa> Is the setting disabled for you too?
01:37:11 <ulmirdin[m]> It's disabled by default.
01:57:26 <accelerate[m]> This will be a dumb question but I'm wondering where the code for the OS is located. More specifically, I found an issue in https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues that I would like to love but I can't find the repo where the code is 🙃

02:15:07 <motoyama> Hello!
02:32:58 <Thatcher[m]> set GrapheneOS launcher as a default notification listener on fresh installs so that the default enabled notification integration is permitted by default like the stock OS (existing users still need to manually enable the permission for the built-in launcher)
02:32:58 <Thatcher[m]> How do I enable that permission for the Graphene launcher?
02:37:05 <sphinx[m]> Thatcher: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210321#c7343799
02:46:40 <Thatcher[m]> I still can't figure it out. No permission shows up that I can see
02:47:57 <Thatcher[m]> I'm dumb. I found it!
02:50:42 <rubberducky> !nick rd101101
02:57:32 <chi00[m]> us there a way to make a default non-owner profile?
02:57:46 <chi00[m]> I don't want to boot up to owner everytime i restart
02:58:24 <ulmirdin[m]> You need to sign in to your Owner profile before you could use user profiles.
02:58:37 <chi00[m]> oh
02:59:56 <ulmirdin[m]> "...owner profile is special and is used to store sensitive system-wide operating system data. This is why the owner profile needs to be logged in after a reboot before other user profiles can be used."

04:35:52 <timetravelingman> No
05:04:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D​4v1dH> It is only notification access
05:10:27 <Thatcher[m]> I can't find the launcher permission. I guess I am dumb afterall

05:49:12 <dar_gomml[m]> anyone had the issue, that charging a pixel 3a only was possible when turned off beforehand? it appeared like a week ago and disappeared with the latest update again. however mass storage and other devices where recognized correctly all time and usabl. (of course i tried with multiple cables/chargers/powerbanks)
06:03:24 <pako> What is the auditor app?
06:03:46 <pako> Grapheneos is compatible for xiaomi mi 9?
06:03:52 <rny> no
06:04:06 <rny> pako: https://attestation.app/tutorial
06:04:15 <rny> https://attestation.app/about
06:04:49 <sphinx[m]> pako: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
06:06:37 <pako> But the trial version could not be installed on xiaomi mi 9 either, right? moment only in pixel?
06:07:15 <rny> what trial version?
06:07:22 <rny> pako: we have no helpdesk either
06:07:23 <rny> :(
06:07:37 <rny> and of course no moneyback guarantee
06:07:41 <rny> :P
06:08:09 <pako> If the police or a person tries to extract data from the phone without unlocking, would it be impossible?
06:08:30 <rny> it'd be really difficult 🙄
06:08:40 <pako> Thanks bro
06:09:25 <rny> really difficult would be an understatement.
06:10:18 <battlepad[m]> <pako "If the police or a person tries "> Ok to clarify: it would be difficult but no impossible
06:10:25 <battlepad[m]> not* impossible
06:36:04 <somenerd[m]> > and of course no moneyback guarantee
06:36:04 <somenerd[m]> Don't think that GrapheneOS charges money lol
06:38:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Attestation is there to verify that your graphene os install hasn't been tampered. Different device can do this verification. I dont think Graphene will ever run on xiaomi due to hardware requirements, custom verifiedboot support and so on
06:39:56 <sphinx[m]> they left
06:40:57 <HarveyPhil85> How long did it take from the release of the Pixel 4a to a launched working version of GrapheneOS for it
06:41:47 <HarveyPhil85> The question is because I'm looking to get the next Pixel phone Google launches, Pixel 5A (obviously not confirmed but yeah)
06:43:31 <HarveyPhil85> Not sure where to find the release date of the first build of GrapheneOS for Pixel 4? Just the date really.
06:50:36 <nscnt[m]> Why do you that there is a correlation? It's not like a chemical reaction that finishes x months after a new device is released
06:52:05 <somenerd[m]> it really depends on maintainers
06:52:24 <futurenewsplz[m]> When I use my gps and youtube app they work fine for the first 10-15 minutes. During those 10-15 minutes I'll let the phone idle and when I return the apps they're unresponsive/frozen. They both were working a month ago but started having this shared problem back in late January early February so I think it might OS-related. Has anyone had a similar situation(s)?
06:52:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> For the pixel 5 it took them 4 month
06:53:24 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Thatcher[m] "Screenshot_20210321-195856.png"> This is it iirc
06:54:08 <HarveyPhil85> Ok interesting. So it can take 6-ish months or maybe longer to develop a version of Graphene for a new Pixel 5. I understand
06:54:53 <somenerd[m]> I mean, if no maintainer steps up, there may not even be a version of Graphene
06:55:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <dar_gomml[m] "anyone had the issue, that charg"> Nah
06:55:15 <StevenDrozd> I was having some issues with the new update so I tried to sideload a fresh installation. Now it says warning previous installation has failed, and I’m getting errors when I try to sideload saying footer is wrong and signature verification failed. What should I do now?
06:56:48 <StevenDrozd> I’m scared I’ll brick it if I reboot
07:06:36 <KONCRETE[m]> I didn't know how much of a Gold Mine this chat is until I went to the Techlore Telegram group..
07:11:12 <KONCRETE[m]> They are speaking on Protonmail, Brave, Whatsapp, Bitcoin and its supposed to be a "Privacy Channel"
07:11:25 <KONCRETE[m]> Of course I'm not the Smartest but damn
07:11:59 <kamesjitt616[m]> Different levels of privacy for different levels of threat models. No gatekeeping
07:50:40 <Nikolai> What is the easiest way to reflash graphene once it's already on the phone?
07:50:56 <rny> reflash is a clean install
07:51:05 <Nikolai> Yes
07:51:17 <rny> follow the web install steps
07:51:37 <Nikolai> Ok

07:56:41 <battlepad[m]> Hey lads, is it possible to enable bottom toolbar in vanadium?
07:56:49 <battlepad[m]> just like how brave has done it
07:57:13 <battlepad[m]> due to my rather weird hand size, i just prefer to keep it below for ergonomics
07:57:38 <whiskey86> No, i dont think so :/
07:57:40 <battlepad[m]> iirc it was removed from upstream chromium around july 2020 with the #duet flag
07:57:56 <battlepad[m]> rip
07:59:04 <whiskey86> I have question too: Is it possible for you to lower the vibration Strength? On my phone there are only options to turn it on or off.
08:09:48 <KONCRETE[m]> <battlepad[m] "Hey lads, is it possible to enab"> Its best to not modify anything in Vanadoium
08:09:53 <KONCRETE[m]> And leave everything on Default
08:10:26 <KONCRETE[m]> * Its best to not modify anything in Vanadium
08:11:01 <Thatcher[m]> I modify everything in Vanadium
08:11:13 <KONCRETE[m]> Well you shouldn't
08:11:18 <Thatcher[m]> I set Site Settings to block everything
08:11:34 <KONCRETE[m]> You are unique and stand out
08:11:48 <battlepad[m]> rip, how can i "factory reset" vanadium?
08:11:51 <Thatcher[m]> <KONCRETE[m] "You are unique and stand out"> Thanks. I enjoy compliments
08:11:56 <battlepad[m]> I enabled a few other chrome flags like tab switcher and stuff
08:14:11 <battlepad[m]> also i am just curious, why is "do not track" on by default in vanadium?
08:14:19 <KONCRETE[m]> TheJollyRodger spoke on this before but you will need to find it
08:14:22 <battlepad[m]> in stock google chrome its disabled by default
08:14:27 <KONCRETE[m]> Everything should be left on default
08:14:38 <KONCRETE[m]> That way everyone's fingerprint matches
08:14:57 <battlepad[m]> ah well, ill just leave it alone then
08:15:34 <KONCRETE[m]> Well everyone who has the same device model as you and leaves vanadium on default will have the same fingerprint
08:15:41 <KONCRETE[m]> And the same applies to bromite
08:15:51 <KONCRETE[m]> Everything should be left on default
08:16:17 <Thatcher[m]> I don't care about fingerprinting all that much. Custom site settings and content blocking = pleasant web experience
08:17:10 <battlepad[m]> not really recommended but i guess personal preference man
08:17:28 <battlepad[m]> usability depends on the individual
08:17:38 <Thatcher[m]> Like I said, I don't give a flying fuck about fingerprinting
08:17:51 <KONCRETE[m]> You should give a fuck
08:18:02 <Thatcher[m]> I will start by blocking you
08:18:06 <KONCRETE[m]> But anyways it up to you
08:18:11 <KONCRETE[m]> Block me bitch
08:18:14 <battlepad[m]> if he wants to get fingerprinted let him lol
08:18:18 <KONCRETE[m]> Idgf
08:18:38 <KONCRETE[m]> Even the Devs agree to leave everything on default
08:19:00 <KONCRETE[m]> Jolly advises from using Brave
08:19:11 <whiskey0111[m]> Is it possible for you to lower the vibration Strength? On my phone there are only options to turn it on or off.
08:20:12 <battlepad[m]> <whiskey0111[m] "Is it possible for you to lower "> I dont think that is possible
08:20:23 <battlepad[m]> sadly
08:20:30 <KONCRETE[m]> Madaidan: You can't just "randomize your fingerprint". That's not how it works. Brave randomizes some specific information that can be used for fingerprinting.
08:20:30 <KONCRETE[m]> TheJollyRoger: Brave does a lot of extremely shady things with ad injection, has been extremely contemptuous toward implementing actual secure design decisions when our developers have reached out to them, and lags behind significantly in patches from upstream. They're more for frills and marketing and such than actual security, but this is enough to get most people convinced that
08:20:53 <whiskey0111[m]> ok because one of the devs told me on Reddit that it should be possible :/
08:21:01 <whiskey0111[m]> Thanks for the help anyway
08:21:30 <battlepad[m]> Wholeheartedly agree KONCRETE thanks for quoting those

12:46:54 <dontdisturbme[m]> Anyone on P4XL or other Pixels experiencing hardlocks after the recent GOS update? No new app updates or new apps installed in-between the previous and latest update
13:17:33 <bypassbobby[m]> Hello people how do I get graphene to detect a USB drive with the adapter?
13:24:14 <dan-is-a-bloody-> hi guys
13:24:30 <dan-is-a-bloody-> does anyone know of a contactless payment provider that works on our grapheneos phones?
13:24:54 <dan-is-a-bloody-> by contactless payments i mean NFC
13:25:17 <dan-is-a-bloody-> like google pay, where u link ur card and then u dont need to carry it around with u everywhere u go
13:28:53 <bypassbobby[m]> It won't switch to data transfer
13:34:42 <m2tu[m]> bypassbobby: do u get request on screen to choose file transfer ?
13:35:14 <m2tu[m]> when u insert usb it shall popupp a message charnign only , which u change to file transfer
13:35:21 <bypassbobby[m]> <m2tu[m] "bypassbobby: do u get request on"> Yes
13:35:28 <bypassbobby[m]> It won't change to file transfer
13:36:14 <m2tu[m]> did u recently had usb debugging on it ?
13:36:26 <m2tu[m]> if so just try restart the phone
13:36:29 <bypassbobby[m]> No not for a year maybe
13:36:55 <m2tu[m]> hmm. than it seems something is in the cable or ur computer drivers
13:37:53 <bypassbobby[m]> What format is best?
13:38:09 <bypassbobby[m]> Maybe fresh reformat may help
13:38:17 <m2tu[m]> usb dirve.. ntfs or fat32
13:38:32 <m2tu[m]> if ext format it will promt u to format the drive
13:39:06 <m2tu[m]> there is also and option in security settings USB pherials
13:39:28 <m2tu[m]> maby u have set to not allow...
13:40:06 <bypassbobby[m]> I had deny selected that must be the problem
13:40:24 <m2tu[m]> yea that can be the prob
13:40:54 <strcat> m2tu[m]: bypassbobby[m]: the file transfer mode is for giving a computer access to the phone
13:41:03 <strcat> not using a USB peripheral like a flash drive
13:41:06 <strcat> it's totally unrelated to that
13:41:35 <strcat> bypassbobby[m]: you just connect the drive when the phone is locked and it works, GrapheneOS prevents attaching a USB peripheral when the device is locked by default (there's a configuration option for it)
13:41:51 <strcat> giving a computer access to the phone is a different thing entirely from using a USB peripheral
13:42:02 <strcat> in one case the phone is the peripheral, in the other it is using a peripheral
13:42:05 <strcat> different things
14:08:03 <bypassbobby[m]> I changed it to allow new peripherals and reformatted flash drive and it worked
14:08:32 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: allowing new peripherals while unlocked will work fine (the default)
14:08:38 <strcat[m]> you just have to connect it when the device is unlocked already
14:21:15 <interesting[m]> graphene os generates new mac address each time I connect to wi fi? I was trying to set up mac filtering on my home router, it means I'd have to whitelist graphene mac address each time?
14:25:11 <strcat> interesting[m]: MAC filtering is useless security theater, don't do it
14:25:27 <strcat> and yes, by default, it uses a new random MAC address each time, as everything should
14:25:46 <strcat> AOSP / stock OS use a new random MAC for a new network and then keep using it until the DHCP lease expires
14:26:02 <strcat> the normal configuration is still available, with 3 options instead of the standard 2
14:26:11 <strcat> interesting[m]: https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
14:26:31 <strcat> anyone can see which MACs are being used by connected devices and can just use one of those...
14:26:49 <strcat> if you want authentication with a key, do authentication with a key
14:26:56 <strcat> don't do security theater stuff harming you more than it helps
14:37:41 <interesting[m]> strcat: thanks
14:41:47 <zvl12[m]> In the new release I can't find how to do the following :
14:41:57 <zvl12[m]>  * In the new release I can't find how to do the following : set GrapheneOS launcher as a default notification listener on fresh installs so that the default enabled notification integration is permitted by default like the stock OS (existing users still need to manually enable the permission for the built-in launcher)
14:45:34 <strcat[m]> either go into Settings -> Apps & notifications -> Special access -> Notification access
14:45:48 <strcat[m]> or use the shortcut via the launcher settings
14:45:55 <strcat[m]> long press home screen -> Home settings
14:53:30 <zvl12[m]> perfect, thanks, just did it. What is the difference if its stays "off" ?
14:54:38 <ulmirdin[m]> I think it enables notification dots
14:55:38 <zvl12[m]> i see it also needs to be done on every profile, and not only the admin
14:56:01 <strcat[m]> it's optional
14:56:16 <strcat[m]> it's needed for the launcher notification integration where it shows notification dots and the long press menu has a list of the notifications
14:56:34 <strcat[m]> it's not a particularly important feature but it's meant to work by default
14:56:42 <strcat[m]> we just fixed it so that on a fresh install, it works out of the box, like the stock OS
15:25:06 <snovak[m]> <m2tu[m] "did u recently had usb debugging"> I think that was it!
15:27:17 <alex-resist> Hi, is this the place where to download factory images from: https://developers.google.com/android/images#sargo ? Looks like it
15:31:55 <damienrg[m]> Sharing phone calls and sms is a feature added by GOS or is in it AOSP?
15:32:26 <damienrg[m]>  * Sharing phone calls and sms between users is a feature added by GOS or is in it AOSP?
15:36:36 <strcat[m]> AOSP
15:58:06 <alex-resist> Ok, successfully flashed stock on a 3a. The fact that this is not only supported by Google, but actually fairly straight-forward, is mind boggling
15:58:20 <Maxattax> Is there a decent workaround for notifications? I've got apps like Slack for work, and I get that you need Google Services to make that notifications work, but if I open the app manually it refreshes the notifications. Can I do something where my phone opens up the apps while the screen is off to check for notifications periodically?
16:14:24 <joeth[m]> <Maxattax "Is there a decent workaround for"> some apps work with microg (even without root/patches) for push notifications, although idk if that's recommended by grapheneos
16:15:13 <strcat[m]> joeth: which apps? that doesn't sound accurate...
16:15:22 <strcat[m]> notifications work fine without Play services
16:15:37 <strcat[m]> many apps use FCM to wake themselves in the background when data is available from their server, etc.
16:15:48 <strcat[m]> they do not need FCM to do that, and it works fine without it if they aren't implemented with it
16:16:18 <strcat[m]> apps using FCM won't work on GrapheneOS because they use it via Play services and the library authenticates the Play services implementation to preserve the security model
16:16:37 <strcat[m]> installing microG will not provide a working implementation of it for multiple reasons
16:17:04 <strcat[m]> there's a big difference between notifications not working (they work fine) and apps not implementing an alternative way to wake themselves in the background via push
16:17:10 <joeth[m]> <strcat[m] "they do not *need* FCM to do tha"> ah okay, i must be wrong. I was thinking of discord, whatsapp and duolingo
16:17:37 <strcat[m]> WhatsApp certainly doesn't need FCM to do push, it has a toggle to keep open a background connection for push itself
16:17:51 <strcat[m]> if you enable the toggle it has push without FCM, without needing to resort to polling
16:18:05 <strcat[m]> need to give it a battery optimization exception too (don't think it asks for one itself)
16:18:36 <strcat[m]> I suggest reporting issues to the app developers and not making the incorrect assumption that it won't work without testing and checking if the app has support for it
16:18:41 <strcat[m]> WhatsApp has non-FCM push
16:19:01 <strcat[m]> if they don't hear from users that people want push without FCM, they won't implement it
16:19:13 <zzxx123[m]> Do yall know of any open source Background-video app recorder?
16:19:14 <joeth[m]> but what about duolingo and discord? this was in work profile with Island btw
16:19:19 <strcat[m]> so, if you aren't contacting them, it's on you that they don't implement it, because they don't think their users care
16:19:32 <strcat[m]> they have to hear from many users that it's wanted
16:19:36 <strcat[m]> and then it will be on their radar
16:19:52 <strcat[m]> and many apps are willing to add a few hundred lines of code to their app/server for it
16:19:54 <zzxx123[m]> <zzxx123[m] "Do yall know of any open source "> help/
16:20:03 <zzxx123[m]> > <@zzxx123:matrix.org> Do yall know of any open source Background-video app recorder?

16:20:07 <zzxx123[m]>  * help?
16:26:38 <Maxattax> strcat[m]: Slack, Rocket.Chat, GroupMe, Discord, Amazon... Wire is supposed to work but they have a bug with backgrounding right now. I tried disabling battery optimization on all these apps, only tested Slack so far without success
16:27:04 <strcat> disabling battery optimization won't accomplish anything unless the app knows how to take advantage of it
16:27:10 <strcat> that's expected
16:27:28 <strcat> they have to actually be doing either push or polling for that to accomplish something
16:27:38 <strcat> and they have to make a correct implementation of course, using appropriate APIs
16:27:45 <zzxx123[m]> 2room
16:27:47 <zzxx123[m]> @room
16:28:01 <strcat> non-moderators can't ping room and that's only meant for urgent stuff
16:28:15 <KONCRETE[m]> Ping?
16:28:35 <Maxattax> I'm not saying anything is broken with Graphene, I just want to find a way to make my push notifications useable without GSM
16:28:56 <zzxx123[m]> Maxattax
16:29:17 <strcat[m]> Maxattax: the app has to implement push (or polling) rather than only using FCM
16:29:20 <Maxattax> I receive notifications if I sit with the app open and screen on, I would expect there to be a way to use the same connection to deliver me the notifications I'm seeking in some manner
16:29:38 <strcat[m]> Maxattax: yes, so ask the app developers to support doing it in the background
16:29:40 * zzxx123[m] uploaded an image: (8KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yKKkLaOgqtUdUSvCkjNxgQUn/XRchD7E.jpg >
16:29:43 <strcat[m]> Maxattax: they already do it in the foreground
16:29:44 <zzxx123[m]> Maxattax: mr cat
16:29:54 <zzxx123[m]> adress as well?
16:30:02 <zzxx123[m]> Do you want it?
16:30:05 <strcat[m]> ah zzxx123_ is just the troll coming here regularly
16:30:12 <zzxx123[m]> "address"
16:30:31 <Maxattax> but can't I find some way to just automatically open the app periodically and perform the existing check? Getting developers on board for 8 different apps is not a feasible solution
16:31:16 <strcat[m]> Maxattax: the apps already implement it
16:31:21 <strcat[m]> they just have to support doing it in the background
16:31:30 <strcat[m]> instead of only relying on FCM to wake their app in the background
16:31:42 <strcat[m]> literally all they have to do is keep open their usual push connection they use in the foreground in the background too
16:31:47 <strcat[m]> that's what supporting this requires
16:31:58 <strcat[m]> they already do push themselves in the foreground in nearly all cases
16:32:24 <strcat[m]> they know how to maintain the connection, and do push through it, since they do it in the foreground
16:32:28 <KONCRETE[m]> Is that guy is actually you?
16:32:28 <strcat[m]> Maxattax: please raise it with the app developers
16:32:44 <KONCRETE[m]> Wtf
16:33:23 <strcat[m]> KONCRETE: no it's a random troll
16:33:34 <strcat[m]> moderation stuff is off-topic for the channel
16:33:45 <strcat[m]> please don't interact with trolls / people raiding the channel
16:33:52 <strcat[m]> and don't discuss them
16:39:57 <strcat[m]> KONCRETE: I think it's the same person associated with Copperhead who was previously impersonating people
16:40:29 <strcat[m]> that wasn't zzxx123
16:40:33 <strcat[m]> zzxx123 is someone on IRC
16:40:38 <strcat[m]> that was someone impersonating them on Matrix
16:41:15 <strcat[m]> unfortunate that the channel is being regularly raided by trolls including trying to make people in the community look bad, it's just a random member of the community, not someone involved in the project
16:41:21 <strcat[m]> very strange and desperate stuff
16:41:34 <strcat[m]> I don't know what they were trying to do
16:41:41 <strcat[m]> impersonate someone and try to make them look annoying? very weird
16:42:32 <snovak[m]> What do you guys use for navigation, like Maps?   I was thinking Waze, but looking around for apks for it, I don't see anything official.  I see APKPure.com, but not sure I dig it.
16:46:54 <thestranger69> Hi, i am using a pixel 4 with grapheneos, but today 2 times when i restarted my phone, fastboot mode came instead of normal grapheneos. I could then press start and enter grapheneos, but it is strange never had this before
16:47:19 <thestranger69> Is my phone maybe hacked? Also my outlook mail cannot delete anything and is throwing me out and crashing
16:47:51 <strcat> thestranger69: you don't have a reason to start thinking your phone is compromised
16:48:09 <strcat> thestranger69: it sounds like a hardware failure
16:48:14 <strcat> storage I/O errors
16:48:49 <thestranger69> Well i dont know here in my counrty the government is spying on everyone
16:49:03 <thestranger69> How can i tell if it is comprimised?
16:49:03 <strcat[m]> it's clearly nothing to do with the phone being compromised
16:49:08 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense
16:49:19 <thestranger69> When i scan auditor it is still green
16:49:40 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: there is no reason to start thinking your phone is compromised
16:50:24 <strcat[m]> you're likely getting I/O errors causing read failures from storage
16:50:33 <thestranger69> Oke hardware failure you think? Do i need a new phone ?
16:50:51 <strcat[m]> that would explain failing to boot and getting dropped into fastboot mode (probably not that?) or recovery (probably this is what happened)
16:51:15 <thestranger69> I could just press the side button and startuo graphene
16:51:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> snovak: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
16:51:24 <thestranger69> And then it started normal
16:51:54 <thestranger69> But is there a way to tell that the phone is comprimesed? A way to check that?
16:52:35 <strcat[m]> what you're talking about has no relation to a potential compromise
16:52:39 <strcat[m]> it isn't at all an indicator of that
16:52:44 <strcat[m]> it isn't the kind of thing that would happen
16:53:21 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: you're having a hardware failure resulting in read/write failures
16:53:37 <thestranger69> Sorry for aksing too much but what would happen if it was comorimesed, so i know if it ever does
16:53:43 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: ~1% of computer hardware of pretty much any kind can be expected to fail
16:53:55 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: there isn't an answer to that and this isn't relevant to your issue
16:54:05 <thestranger69> Okeyy thank you
17:05:01 <princemachiavell> Does anyone have issues with the bottom microphone? During a phone call or direct mic record I can only get the microphone to register by tapping the phone. It's not picking up other sounds at all. Could be a hardware issue on my end but thought I'd check.
17:05:53 <strcat[m]> hardware issue if you do
17:06:15 <strcat[m]> sounds like a loose connection or damage from dropping / water damage (on the non water resistant phones particularly)
17:06:41 <strcat[m]> microphones and cameras are some of the things that tend to fail after a phone has been dropped
17:16:24 <Zadok0552> Just got Andriod 11 update autoinstalled from Google  Was going to install grapheneos but now don’t see the DEV option in settings for OEM unlock. Anyone have an idea what I can do? Pixel 4a
17:16:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> For some reason I'm not able to use a USB device or connect to my phone to with my computer because it will either get charged by my computer or it charges the USB-Stick
17:17:06 <strcat[m]> Zadok0552:  please follow our official guide
17:17:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Is there anything to fix this?
17:17:46 <strcat[m]> @alpha0bit plugging in the phone to a computer and using it as a USB peripheral for the computer is a completely different thing from using a USB peripheral with the phone
17:17:55 <strcat[m]> it doesn't sound like anything is broken
17:18:18 <strcat[m]> when you plug in the phone to a computer, the only thing it does by default is charging the phone
17:18:42 <strcat[m]> you have to manually enable more than that via the notification if you want to use the phone as a USB peripheral such as making the profile's home directory available to the computer
17:18:48 <strcat[m]> 0 differences from AOSP / stock OS for that
17:19:26 <strcat[m]> for USB peripherals, there's 1 minor difference: GrapheneOS disallows connecting them when the screen is locked by default (it's a setting, and the default is meant to be very usable, you just have to connect them when unlocked, or they have to be there at boot, since that doesn't compromise the threat model it uses)
17:22:10 <gamrix> Thanks!
17:22:19 <Zadok0552> @strcat[m] The offical guide is open and the instructions for OEM unlocking do not work. There is no developer option As in “Settings ➔ System ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer options and toggle on the 'Enable OEM unlocking' setting” — There is no dev option except for the camera settings.
17:26:13 <entry1[m]> <Zadok0552 "@strcat[m] The offical guide is "> You did enable developer options correct? It is not accessible without getting access by continuously tapping the build number. If you did that, the option will be available in settings for OEM unlocking. It may be greyed out if you are not connected to WiFi or have a carrier locked variant of the phone.
17:33:54 <strcat[m]> Zadok0552: it tells you how to enable developer options
17:34:11 <strcat[m]> Zadok0552: https://grapheneos.org/install/web#enabling-oem-unlocking
17:34:13 <strcat[m]> previous paragraph
17:34:18 <strcat[m]> > Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ➔ About phone and repeatedly pressing the build number menu entry until developer mode is enabled.
17:34:25 <strcat[m]> have you done that? it will tell you when you've done it
17:34:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> It doesn't even give me the option to switch between File Transfer or just Charging?
17:35:25 <Zadok0552> strcat[m] Thanks. i had forgotten the build thing
17:36:05 <strcat[m]> @alpha0bit: as stated above, connecting to a computer and connecting a USB peripheral to the phone are different things
17:36:17 <strcat[m]> you'll need to be specific about which one you're doing and how you have it connected
17:36:30 <strcat[m]> use the USB cable which comes with the device or a *high quality8 USB-A to USB-C cable if you must
17:36:34 <strcat[m]>  * use the USB cable which comes with the device or a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable if you must
17:37:10 <Zadok0552> Geez… It’s like a never rooted a phone before lol
17:38:11 <strcat[m]> installing GrapheneOS doesn't involve 'rooting'
17:38:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Well in this case I try to transfer files to my USB Stick that was given in the package when I bought the Pixel
17:38:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> I mean the adapter
17:39:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> That came with the package
17:40:54 <strcat[m]> so, if you're trying to connect a USB flash drive to the phone, that is a totally different thing from connecting to a computer
17:41:02 <strcat[m]> there's no 'file transfer' mode to enable, it's a totally different thing
17:41:08 <strcat[m]> you just open up the system file manager and move the files over
17:41:19 <Zadok0552> Oh. nor rooting… It’s just you have to unlock the bootloader to do that too.
17:41:20 <strcat[m]> read the previous response explaining that USB peripherals cannot be connected while locked by default
17:44:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Yeah I know that's a different thing I just meant by that, that both ways don't work (Can't transfer files to my USB or Transfer the files to my Computer with my Computer)
17:45:00 <strcat[m]> they're different things, explained in detail above what needs to be done for both
17:45:03 <strcat[m]> works well either way
17:45:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> a​lpha0bit shared a photo on Telegram with caption: 'But for example it doesn't show any USB here'
17:45:17 <strcat[m]> can't see pictures across the bridge
17:45:30 <strcat[m]> if you plug in the USB flash drive, while the device is unlocked, it will show up in the file manager
17:45:42 <strcat[m]> if you plug the phone into a computer, it will show a notification which can be used to enable file transfer
17:45:44 <strcat[m]> different things
17:47:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Yeah the Problem is for me that it doesn't it just says in the Notification: "Charging connected device via USB"
17:47:32 <strcat[m]> it's expected for it to say that
17:47:36 <strcat[m]> part of it working
17:47:45 <strcat[m]> when you plug in a USB peripheral to the phone it's responsible for powering it
17:47:49 <strcat[m]> it considers that 'charging'
17:48:00 <strcat[m]> it would say that for a mouse too
17:48:03 <zvl12[m]> Someone solved the mystery why SMS messsages doesnt ring in a secondary profile (but only vibrates) ?
17:48:19 <strcat[m]> as far as the phone knows, the peripheral has a battery being charged, by 'charged' it means it is the device supplying power rather than vice versa or not at all
17:48:32 <strcat[m]> read it as 'supplying power' instead of 'charging' if that makes it clearer
17:50:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Oh okay, thanks
17:55:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> But yeah the file manager still doesn't show the USB-Stick
17:56:27 <strcat[m]> are you using the connector which came with the phone?
17:56:43 <strcat[m]> and it is a proper certified OTG compatible USB device? should work regardless unless it's really broken though
17:56:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Yeah
17:57:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> I've tried 2 USB Sticks from 2 different brands both won't work (If tried one before and it worked then)
17:58:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> But now it won't?
18:02:08 <strcat[m]> make sure to connect when the screen is unlocked, and check the USB accessories setting to make sure you didn'
18:02:14 <strcat[m]>  * make sure to connect when the screen is unlocked, and check the USB accessories setting to make sure you didn't disable USB peripherals completely

18:23:04 <strcat[m]> yes, it keeps open a connection
18:23:15 <strcat[m]> it doesn't poll but rather uses push, with occasional pings to keep alive the connection
18:23:20 <strcat[m]> it's far less optimized than it could be
18:23:29 <strcat[m]> it doesn't try very hard to make the pings as infrequent as possible
18:23:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Meh
18:23:51 <strcat[m]> anyways it's actual push, same implementation as what you get when the app is in the foreground
18:23:53 <strcat[m]> same code
18:24:36 <strcat[m]> it just keeps a foreground service running to continue keeping the server connection open in the background
18:25:06 <strcat[m]> foreground service is not strictly required but is a really good idea to make sure the app keeps running to keep the connection open
18:25:38 <strcat[m]> it's possible to do it with a while idle alarm without it, but sometimes the app will get killed and it won't respawn until the next alarm interval
18:26:33 <strcat[m]> there's a very reliable / efficient way to do it, which is what FCM does, and other apps need a foreground service to match that properly
18:29:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> FCM?
18:30:06 <strcat> Firebase Cloud Messaging, the API apps use for push messages on the stock OS
18:30:12 <strcat> part of Play services
18:30:58 <strcat> apps can also implement the same thing themselves: keep open a connection, run a foreground service to stay alive, listen for network change events to deal with reconnecting, and occasionally ping the connection to make sure it didn't die + deal with stuff like CGNAT dropping idle connections against TCP spec
18:31:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> I checked it already and tried the "Always" option which didn't help aswell
18:32:38 <strcat> sounds like broken USB devices then
18:34:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> I can use it without Problems on my Computer, format it, put files on it and so on
18:34:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> It doesn't seem to be broken
18:34:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> If I hide that notification, for examples make signals connection notification hidden/disabled; Will it still work
18:38:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> Anyone using White Sim??
18:38:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Probably another weird bug I got again while using GrapheneOS which can be solved by factory resetting my phone (I almost always get some type of bugs after some time while I used GrapheneOS for some reason (Something with the OS itself and not apps))
18:53:36 <strcat> @a​lpha0bit seriously doubt it's a bug, and that sounds like a *you* problem not a GrapheneOS problem
18:53:49 <strcat> suggest not messing with adb, not disabling system apps, not revoking internally used permissions, etc.
18:54:38 <strcat> when you have a unique issue only happening for you, never for others, there's usually a reason for that
18:55:03 <strcat> are those USB drives actually OTG compatible?
18:55:13 <strcat> if not, you shouldn't really expect them to work
18:55:20 <strcat> but nearly anything modern would be
18:55:42 <nnm> https://www.kryptex.org/?ref=67f397d3
18:56:20 <strcat> USB ecosystem being a mess is not a GrapheneOS issue

19:28:43 <koppfika> I have a question and i dont know if im allowed to ask here but... i have pixel 3. i followed all steps in Web installer and everything worked just as the guide explains, i lock the bootloader after everything is complete without any error.  when i pres "start" after all complete it does not boot graphene os, only normal android. i tryed this 4
19:28:44 <koppfika> times and same everythime.    i chck this video aswell, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
20:10:37 <skwisgaar[m]> @freenode_koppfika:matrix.org: I’m unable to help you with that installation issue, but do not follow that guide. You could very well end up bricking your device.
20:10:59 <skwisgaar[m]> Nvm they left lol
20:11:15 <skwisgaar[m]> That’s a shame
20:14:18 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Hey guys! Can you tell me the best way to get playstore functionality? MicroG or flash 3rd parity gapps like nikgapps? Thank you..
20:14:47 <zzxx123_> strcat I'm a troll now? OK I'll leave
20:15:24 <skwisgaar[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: You can’t install anything like that on graphene.
20:15:30 <sphinx[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: You can use Aurora Store to download apps from Play Store.
20:15:31 <zzxx123_> I don't know who the fuck is the zzxx123 on Matrix
20:15:35 <skwisgaar[m]> zzxx123_: I think someone was impersonating you
20:16:37 <fr488[m]> Nice chat
20:17:41 <skwisgaar[m]> fr488: there are some scummy people who really hate this project.
20:24:32 <jimmyneutrino[m]> any banks with apps that don't use safetynet? 🤔 tough question
20:24:33 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> And many who love it and I do but sadly cannot live without my bought apps on playstore.. So is there a way cause GrapheneOS + gapps would be better than "anything else" + gapps right?
20:24:57 <strcat[m]> zzxx123_: wasn't talking about you
20:25:02 <strcat[m]> zzxx123_: someone stole your name, among other people
20:25:17 <strcat[m]> zzxx123_: they've been harassing me with really stupid stuff and impersonating people
20:25:24 <strcat[m]> it's a continuation of Copperhead's earlier raids on the channel
20:25:33 <strcat[m]> those people are seriously screwed up
20:26:00 <strcat[m]> I think it's quite possibility one of the same people from before especially considering that they're using the same impersonation tactic
20:26:08 <strcat[m]> they abuse the Matrix display names
20:26:33 <strcat[m]> since you can set your display name to anything and then Element distinguishes between 2 people with the same display name by showing (username@server) afterwards
20:27:00 <strcat[m]> so what they do is set their name to someone else's with a fake (username@server) since Element doesn't distinguish between the trusted app UI for that and something someone set in their own display name
20:27:15 <strcat[m]> I consider that a security vulnerability just as it is in other contexts where a UI is designed wrong and can be faked
20:29:12 <strcat[m]> zzxx123_: someone on IRC left, the troll took their name, we banned them, then the person came back and we thought it was the troll (resolved that now)
20:29:14 <strcat[m]> really annoying
20:33:51 <visla[m]> It really is crazy and petty that they've been on this crusade to discredit an open source project for so long now. Just.. move on. There's a billion legislature causes to support and that's not one of them.
20:33:56 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Could this work with GrapheneOS (when rooted with magisk)?
20:33:56 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/microG_installer
20:35:11 <visla[m]> * It really is crazy and petty that they've been on this crusade to discredit an open source project for so long now. Just.. move on. There's a billion legitamate causes to support and that's not one of them.
20:35:32 <visla[m]> * It really is crazy and petty that they've been on this crusade to discredit an open source project for so long now. Just.. move on. There's a billion legitimate causes to support and that's not one of them.
20:37:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Then its not GrapheneOS anymore
20:37:46 <skwisgaar[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: you can’t root GrapheneOS. https://grapheneos.org will probably answer many of your questions about the OS.
20:48:02 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> skwisgaar[m] Sure? I'm thinking of patching the boot.img with magisk and then flash it back.. Also I read something about microg support from grapheneos but didn't understand..
20:56:04 <ulmirdin[m]> By rooting and adding microg you significantly decrease the security of the device.
20:56:31 <strcat> tgasdgasdhr45zd: there's no such thing as GrapheneOS with those things
20:56:35 <strcat> it wouldn't be GrapheneOS
20:56:54 <ulmirdin[m]> If most apps that you use don't work on Graphene—stick with stock.
20:57:00 <strcat> if you replace the boot image with something else and totally destroy the security model across the OS, that's hardly anything like GrapheneOS
20:57:23 <strcat> microG has significant security issues itself
20:57:30 <strcat> it doesn't enforce security checks properly
20:57:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> guys in GrapheneOS
20:58:00 <strcat> and then if you're going to totally wipe out a huge portion of the security model to use it... why are you interested in GrapheneOS at all then?
20:58:08 <strcat> you'd be doing more damage than the improvements you get from GrapheneOS
20:58:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> the firewall on GrapheneOS can do: Automatic discovery of IMSI Catchers and rogue base stations,  Detection of attempts to track  ,user location via SS7 or silent SMS
20:58:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> ?
20:59:36 <strcat> suggest reading the info in our FAQ
21:00:00 <strcat> those aren't actual security features with any meaning, you're listing out fake security features in scam products
21:00:07 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Okay, understand.. So what is the point of using GrapheneOS when the things I want to secure (like my banking app) won't even work on it?
21:00:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking this u refering to?
21:00:31 <strcat> yes please read that section
21:00:40 <strcat> GrapheneOS won't include fake / non-working 'security' features
21:00:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> SS7 or silent sms is not security?
21:00:51 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> I know, I should blame my bank for not providing a apk but which bank actually does?
21:00:53 <strcat> also, LTE only mode is only there for attack surface reduction
21:01:03 <strcat> @acegeorge: you're talking about fake security features
21:01:07 <strcat> read the section
21:01:18 <strcat> please read it fully and spend some time thinking about it
21:01:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> ok
21:01:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> reading as we talk now
21:03:19 <strcat> a silent SMS is literally just an SMS with a flag set that says it's a no-op
21:03:23 <strcat> i.e. no message content
21:03:48 <strcat> it doesn't have privacy/security relevance in reality
21:03:57 <strcat> and is little different from just receiving spam or anything else via SMS
21:04:04 <strcat> SMS for LTE and beyond is simply data anyway...
21:04:07 <strcat> as are calls
21:04:41 <strcat> if you're using LTE only mode (which does not increase privacy or protect communications from interception in any meaningful way, not why it exists) then you only have data
21:04:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> "Receiving a silent SMS is not a good indicator of being targeted by your cell carrier, police or government because anyone on the cell network can send them including yourself. Cellular triangulation will happen regardless of whether or not SMS texts are being sent or received by the phone. Even if an SMS did serve a useful purpose for tracking, a silent SMS would be little different than receiving unsolicited spam. In f
21:04:49 <strcat> calls and texts for LTE and above are data only
21:04:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> this is very generic and doesnt say what happens
21:04:57 <strcat> I can't see your whole message
21:05:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> if u get targeted
21:05:06 <strcat> again
21:05:18 <strcat> a silent SMS is simply a normal SMS with a flag set that it has no content, etc. and doesn't need to be shown
21:05:22 <strcat> anyone can send them, you can send them
21:05:26 <strcat> it doesn't have a privacy impact
21:05:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> it reveals ur location
21:05:41 <strcat> no
21:05:53 <strcat> you're getting misinformation from charlatans
21:06:03 <strcat> if you're connected to the cellular network, your location is known to the cellular network
21:06:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> Target phone should return its GPS coordinates and cell id and the estimated accuaracy.
21:06:11 <strcat> no
21:06:19 <strcat> not how things work
21:06:27 <strcat> read the section and read what I wrote here
21:06:36 <strcat> please don't spread misinformation
21:06:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> this is true yeah, so maybe a white sim is an added protection?
21:07:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> i dont spread, i ask !
21:07:09 <strcat> if you're connected to the cellular network
21:07:14 <strcat> it knows your IMEI and where you are
21:07:25 <strcat> the only thing that stops that is using airplane mode (where you can still use wifi, etc.)
21:07:30 <strcat> so, that's what we document
21:07:37 <strcat> it's the reality of how cell phone networks work
21:07:53 <strcat> using some random SIM gives you a different subscription, sure, but not a different IMEI which is per device
21:08:10 <strcat> airplane mode is the only thing that stops your location being known to the cellular network
21:08:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> you cant hide your IMEI?
21:08:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> or fake it
21:08:26 <strcat> you can't hide it, it's not supposed to be possible at all
21:08:33 <strcat> and cellular radios are not supposed to permit it
21:09:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> so white sim is a good added measurement ?
21:09:08 <strcat> the way it works is your IMEI identifies the radio uniquely
21:09:36 <strcat> a SIM is a secure element that authenticates you with the carrier
21:09:43 <strcat> to show you are a paying subscriber
21:09:50 <strcat> changing your SIM just changes your subscription to another
21:09:54 <strcat> they still see the radio id
21:09:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> noo
21:10:01 <strcat> they know it's the same hardware phone
21:10:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> i dont mean this normal sim
21:10:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> sec
21:10:09 <wish_i_was_real[> You can activate fly mode
21:10:11 <strcat> I know what you mean
21:10:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> https://omertadigital.com/pages/omerta-security-sim-cards-what-are-they
21:10:24 <strcat> a reprogrammable SIM is the same as swapping SIMs
21:10:25 <wish_i_was_real[> I believe it will hide you but without any conexion
21:10:28 <strcat> it doesn't hide your hardware id to the network
21:10:39 <strcat> airplane mode is the only thing stopping cellular network from knowing where you are
21:10:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> it goes through their servers first
21:11:11 <strcat> there's still an IMEI
21:11:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> So this will not help?
21:12:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> because they say that the encrypt ur data
21:12:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> ur normal voice call
21:13:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> Plus, governments for example now i just read they purchased some software & hardware that can spy on your Mobile, turn on ur mic, listen to your whatsapp,signal, viber etc...so they have to target u by ur phone number
21:13:45 <jpds> A VPN and a Signal call would encrypt your data
21:15:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> look at this : https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/j66c3m/greek_government_buys_tech_for_surveilling_signal/
21:15:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> this is from r/signal
21:15:46 <strcat[m]> so, you're just getting your information from headlines on Reddit and other non-technical places?
21:15:51 <jpds> acegeorge: Comment #1
21:15:52 <strcat[m]> and then filling in the details with assumptions?
21:16:12 <strcat[m]> acegeorge: it's just not production to go through this
21:16:17 <strcat[m]> get your information from reliable, technical sources
21:16:32 <strcat[m]> not people who don't know what they're talking about or companies selling products with dishonest marketing
21:16:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> What about Encrochat? they were E2EE
21:16:59 <strcat[m]> you can't believe anything a company selling supposedly privacy / security enhancing products tells you because the industry as a whole is largely a bunch of scams
21:17:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> and everything was leaked
21:17:04 <strcat[m]> what about it?
21:17:17 <strcat[m]> and have you actually looked at what they provided, and what happened with it?
21:17:19 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem that way
21:17:34 <strcat[m]> carrier-based calls and texts are insecure and trust all the carriers, not even just your own
21:17:52 <strcat[m]> if you care at all about privacy then you're obviously avoiding those
21:17:53 <strcat[m]> as a given
21:18:15 <strcat[m]> even transport security with a server you choose is better than those... but of course end-to-end encryption client to client avoiding trusting a server is a lot better
21:18:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> i see
21:18:34 <strcat[m]> carrier-based calls/texts do not even give you the basics of meaningful transport security
21:18:46 <strcat[m]> they're totally insecure
21:18:54 <jpds> jpds | A VPN and a Signal call would encrypt your data
21:18:56 <strcat[m]> avoiding those is a basic necessary step
21:19:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> so something like this: https://www.cryptophone.de/en/products/mobile/cp600g/
21:19:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> wont be more secure than a pixel + GrapheneOS?
21:19:47 <blacklight447[m]> Pro tip: assume any network is untrusted and act accordingly
21:20:11 <blacklight447[m]> Wifi networks, celluar networks, etc
21:20:43 <strcat[m]> acegeorge: please read all the responses already given above
21:20:55 <blacklight447[m]> Always try to opt to use atleast some form of encryption like a TLS session
21:21:29 <blacklight447[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<acegeorge> wont be more secure "> Lol no
21:21:31 <strcat[m]> acegeorge: read the FAQ section on cellular again
21:21:32 <blacklight447[m]> Stay away from any of these speciliazed "cryptophones"
21:22:07 <blacklight447[m]> Basically all of them are just scams to lure in dumb criminals which will pay big money to keep the feds out
21:22:19 <strcat[m]> also, please avoid linking to or promoting products here, and avoid linking to non-technical / untrustworthy sources of information
21:22:35 <strcat[m]> this is also the on-topic GrapheneOS channel
21:22:40 <blacklight447[m]> They assume if they have to pay alot to use it, it must be good, even if something like signal would be way better
21:23:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> ok i deleted the product
21:23:18 <blacklight447[m]> It very similar to what our friend JollyRoger calls toxic user mentality
21:23:58 <blacklight447[m]> If they havent tweaked alot on something or paid a lot of money, then it cant be secure in their mind
21:25:31 <strcat> the privacy and security industries are largely a scam
21:25:39 <blacklight447[m]> One of the recent examples woild be skyECC, which claimed to be unbreakable and be the most secure platform, and surprise surprise, it was broken
21:25:54 <strcat> paid products or not, most stuff claiming to give you privacy/security is at best usually useless
21:25:56 <strcat> and often is harmful
21:26:07 <blacklight447[m]> Stay away from them.
21:26:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !John has joined the Telegram Group!

21:34:09 <strcat[m]> you're getting your information from people pushing their ideology, products, etc.
21:34:14 <strcat[m]> and people promoting themselves as influencers
21:34:19 <strcat[m]> that's not what I was saying
21:34:32 <strcat[m]> I think this is off-topic and not productive
21:34:37 <kamesjitt616[m]> True
21:34:41 <ulmirdin[m]> kamesjitt616: Reading the GrapheneOS wiki and checking the log for this channel would be a good place to start.
21:35:01 <ulmirdin[m]> There is already a ton information available just in this chat.
21:35:15 <blacklight447[m]> Always remember to look at someones track record as well
21:35:23 <skwisgaar[m]> As strcat said, get your info from security researchers and engineers. The reason there is so much confusion is because most people consider overconfident laypersons, power users who overstate their knowledge, software developers, etc. to be good sources for security info.
21:35:34 <blacklight447[m]> For example, strcat gained my trust after the copperhead scam
21:35:38 <skwisgaar[m]> Not the case
21:35:38 <feedmeenergydrin> Hi again - I'm setting up a new GrapheneOS device with multiple profiles. I set up the first profile just fine, including installing f-droid on that profile. However, on my second profile, when I try to install f-droid it fails with the message "app not installed". Did I screw something up on the second profile, or is installing the same app on
21:35:38 <feedmeenergydrin> different profiles not allowed?
21:35:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> pixel 5 vs pixel 4a 5G have the same protection and will be developed for the same period?
21:35:50 <strcat[m]> yes
21:35:54 <strcat[m]> they're basically the same device
21:36:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> oh
21:36:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> I don't think you can install F-droid twice
21:36:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> strcat for VPN what u recommend?
21:36:16 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5 has nicer externals (wireless charging, nicer screen, nicer build, dust/waterproofing, etc.)
21:36:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> He dosent
21:36:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We don't recommend vpn
21:36:27 <strcat[m]> I don't give app or VPN recommendations
21:36:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> This is off topic
21:36:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> He trusts his canadian ISP
21:36:36 <blacklight447[m]> Seeing someone choose morality, when he could have easily made big money by selling oit like james wanted too, thats something i respect.
21:36:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Such as Jolly
21:36:45 <strcat[m]> @John: please don't make stuff up
21:36:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> oh lol ok guys dont slap me lol
21:37:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> https://t.me/grapheneosofftopic
21:37:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Or maybe it was jolly who said it
21:37:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> thanks for link
21:37:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> He said something he trusts his ISP more than some random vpn
21:37:38 <feedmeenergydrin> Ok, so even if they're on different profiles, I can still only have one copy of the same app installed across the entire device?
21:37:39 <blacklight447[m]> Same with edward snowden, guy had it all,  high paying job, luxury house on hawaii, girlfriend, brighr future, and he threw it away for what he thought was right
21:38:50 <sphinx[m]> feedmeenergydrin: You can't install an older version of an app than you have in 1 profile.
21:39:19 <feedmeenergydrin> Ahh, that makes sense then, thank you :D
21:39:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> after flashing GrapheneOS is there any good recommendation of Apps to install to harden it /protect even more?
21:39:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> other than Signal and VPN i mean
21:39:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> I don't think so
21:40:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> There is no hardening else to do with an app
21:41:09 <sphinx[m]> feedmeenergydrin: You need to download the latest F-Droid version, not the outdated one they have as the main download.
21:41:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> also GrapheneOS updates OTA?
21:41:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Yes
21:42:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> oki
21:42:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> which phone u guys use?
21:42:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Pixels
21:42:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> yeah, which model i mean
21:42:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Well I can't speak for everyone in here
21:43:00 <ulmirdin[m]> 4a
21:43:55 <chris42[m]> Pixel 5
21:43:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Oh sh
21:44:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Ive been forgetting to Update it
21:44:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Mines really Outdated
21:44:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> F-Droid doesnt update automatically?
21:46:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> Also WhatsApp is a nono install on grapheneos right?
21:46:33 <jpds> acegeorge: Works fine
21:46:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> in terms of privacy i mean
21:46:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Its all up to you if you want to use Whatsapp
21:47:19 <jpds> acegeorge: You can install whatever you want
21:47:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> But its owned by Facebook and Google so that's probably not good
21:49:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> yeah
21:54:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> grapheneos will also get updated to Android 11 too?
21:55:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> It already is
21:55:01 <jpds> acegeorge: Was ages ago
21:55:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!John> Yep
21:55:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> sorry android 12 lol
21:55:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> im an iOS user i messed up the android versions
21:55:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> lol
21:57:04 <jpds> acegeorge: Yes, cause all that comes from AOSP
21:57:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> nice 🙂
21:57:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> also F-Droid doesnt update itself?
21:58:02 <ulmirdin[m]> Android 12 will launch after August this year
21:58:28 <jpds> a​cegeorge: No
21:58:32 <ulmirdin[m]> It is still being tested
22:03:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ulmirdin[m] "Android 12 will launch after Aug"> Thanks for being so obvious
22:03:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google always releases second week of September or so
22:04:38 <Hasi123> Good Evening..
22:04:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also discussions like these are off topic
22:04:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
22:05:21 <Hasi123> What is your oppinion on root access?
22:06:24 <jpds> Hasi123: Don't
22:06:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> technically now, GrapheneOS vs Stock Android has a lot of difference in terms of security??
22:07:10 <Hasi123> Okay, but on every Linux OS I can have root and it is not insecure..?
22:07:12 <jpds> acegeorge: All covered on the website
22:07:34 <jpds> Hasi123: -> #grapheneos-offtopic
22:07:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Hasi123 "Okay, but on every Linux OS I ca"> Linux desktop is pretty insecure
22:08:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> ok
22:09:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> F-Droid is better than Aurora?
22:10:03 <zzxx123_> These questions are getting spammy tbh
22:10:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R​efaimufeer> F-Droid for open source apps which are unique for private reasons, on the other hand Aurora is for extracting the apps from Google Play store
22:11:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> ohh
22:29:33 <Xcutioner[m]> Anyone had issues installing GrapheneOS on Pixel 4A 5G
22:42:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> What kind of issues?
22:52:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> guys VoLTE and VoWiFi should be turned on or off?
22:59:31 <amicitia> Hello i see in orbot vpn setting the com.google android ac is this a part of graphene os
22:59:59 <amicitia> Can not find it in the apps systeem
23:00:43 <thestranger69> Hi, i am.using a pixel 4 and i bought a pixel 4a, how can i send all the pictures from 1 to another the east way ?
23:00:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> https://sec.eff.org/articles/recommending-tools
23:00:56 <thestranger69> Easy way
23:05:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> https://theintercept.com/2016/09/12/long-secret-stingray-manuals-detail-how-police-can-spy-on-phones/
23:05:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> does this work on grapheneos?
23:08:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​e_Is_HaZaRdOuS> with a computer?
23:21:17 <thestranger69> Yeah would those stingrays also work on grapheneos, i would like to know that to. I think only strcat knows the answer to this
23:23:53 <rny> thestranger69: this was covered numerous times, please search the logs. The discussion ends here.
23:24:42 <thestranger69> How do i search the logs, i am using irc client revolution? I can only see my own history
23:25:05 <rny> thestranger69: https://freenode.logbot.info/
23:26:57 <rny> o_O a freenode staff got k-lined
23:27:08 <strcat[m]> @acegeorge: you were linked to the relevant documentation and given extensive replies about it
23:27:58 <thestranger69> Cant find no logs about the interception, maybe i m too noob
23:28:07 <strcat[m]> okay
23:28:09 <strcat[m]> read our documentation on the site
23:28:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
23:28:32 <strcat[m]> carrier-based texts and calls are insecure, avoid them, nothing will make them secure
23:28:46 <strcat[m]> trusting networks is a mistake and completely unnecessary
23:29:12 <thestranger69> So when using encrypted communication like signal the interceptor from police is useless?
23:29:17 <strcat[m]> you do realize that avoiding interception still leaves you trusting the cellular network as a whole, including your carrier and also other carriers?
23:30:21 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: if everything at least has authenticated transport encryption, then they don't get data from it
23:30:23 <thestranger69> Well if i want to use a mobile phone i kinda have to use the carriers network, there s no way around that
23:30:30 <strcat[m]> Signal does better by having end-to-end encryption
23:30:34 <strcat[m]> not just transport encryption
23:30:46 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: it doesn't imply using their insecure calls/texts though
23:31:17 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: don't really understand you're concerned about those being interception between you and the cell tower rather than the fact that your carrier and other carriers have access to it and can grant that access to others
23:31:21 <strcat[m]> a ton of people have access
23:31:22 <thestranger69> Well as far as i read, signal is the best app at this moment for secure communication
23:31:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> @strcat because i dont understand, "trusting networks is a mistake and completely unnecessary" does that mean that 5G/4G usage of Signal can be intercepted ???
23:31:56 <strcat[m]> it's the most secure option for communicating with someone based on your phone number and theirs
23:32:19 <strcat[m]> @acegeorge: I consider what you're doing concern trolling and you'll be banned if you continue
23:32:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> i am not trolling
23:32:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> -_-
23:32:51 <strcat[m]> read what concern trolling is
23:33:06 <rny> is this person ban-evading?
23:33:31 <strcat[m]> not atm
23:33:36 <thestranger69> And is there an app that is secure like signal that doesnt need a phone number? I trief threema but it is not all open source from my understanding
23:33:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> jesus christ lol
23:34:13 <entry1[m]> <thestranger69 "And is there an app that is secu"> App suggestions by the community can be asked in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
23:34:23 <strcat[m]> @a​cegeorge: look, no matter what the topic is, you keep raising these totally baseless and irrational assumptions of the worst and it derails the discussion + misinforms others
23:35:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> strcat, can i link you a video i am watching right now that made me just jump in to the discussion?
23:35:42 <strcat[m]> don't want to see a video
23:36:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> aight
23:36:15 <strcat[m]> I already said earlier to get better sources of information
23:36:42 <strcat[m]> if you do research where you consume low quality content
23:36:45 <strcat[m]> you aren't informing yourself
23:36:49 <strcat[m]> you're misinforming yourself
23:36:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> you are right
23:37:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> but this is from a Security Engineer
23:37:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> (the video)
23:37:16 <strcat[m]> carrier-based calls/texts are insecure and trust the carrier networks
23:37:19 <strcat[m]> you don't want to do that
23:37:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> i get that
23:37:28 <entry1[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<acegeorge> strcat, can i link y"> Please follow the website's instructions. Many videos are bad/outdated sources of information. We would be happy to help you with specific questions you have, but pinging the lead developer isnt necessary. A lot of other people could help you in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
23:37:32 <strcat[m]> no interception required to get your calls/texts if you use carrier-based calls/texts
23:37:42 <strcat[m]> they are simply insecure in a bunch of ways
23:37:49 <strcat[m]> don't have any meaningful authentication or encryption
23:38:13 <strcat[m]> your connection to the carrier network is also not meaningfully authenticated, and what would it really be authenticating? just that it's your carrier's network
23:39:21 <strcat[m]> use transport encryption with forward secrecy at a bare minimum, and ideally end-to-end encryption with forward secrecy
23:39:23 <thestranger69> Does that mean that when you are connecter to carrier you are always insecure? Even using encryption apps like signal and telegram?
23:39:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> just trying to find a way to communicate when i dont have a WiFI and im not able to turn on Airplane mode
23:39:38 <strcat[m]> thestranger69: no, that's not what was said
23:39:55 <strcat[m]> also really seems like there are certain people active here right now via multiple accounts
23:40:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> i hope u dont imply me ---
23:40:39 <entry1[m]> It really seems like concern trolling, its non stop questions in the main channel.
23:40:43 <thestranger69> I am not usong accounts, i am vudu strcat i am asking honest question because i want to understand
23:41:08 <strcat[m]> well, I explained it above
23:41:44 <thestranger69> Oke thanks, but i am not trying to troll or anything i come ofter here to learn, thats all
23:43:00 <thestranger69> My english is not so great so sometimes it seems like you re talking to a dumb person, i ask question to understand better
23:43:37 <thestranger69> Dont know what phone to trust anymore everything is being hacked lately
23:44:47 <thestranger69> Even skyecc is hacked in belgium, those phone were 1500 euro i think
23:57:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> @acegeorge
23:58:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> You have been warned by a moderator and you still continue with said behaviour
23:58:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Might I add that you're also wasting time by asking to ask
23:59:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> This
