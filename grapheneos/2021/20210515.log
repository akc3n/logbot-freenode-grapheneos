00:17:52 <Ted> Hi. I'm trying to remove graphen OS but I was unsuccessful.
00:18:15 <Guest35013> I removed the non stock ley and then booted and it loaded into graphen again

00:18:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ted: ^
00:18:50 <akc3n[m]> Guest35013: > Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process described above.
00:18:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Also, what is your error messageTed
00:19:16 <akc3n[m]> Guest35013: https://developers.google.com/android/images
00:19:22 <Guest35013> No error message. It booted back to the graphen OS
00:19:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]>  Guest35013 Was talking to Ted
00:19:38 <Guest35013> I didnt have the image
00:19:44 <Guest35013> I'm ted.
00:19:47 <Guest35013> it changed my name
00:19:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Guest35013: Oh I see
00:20:16 <bearbyte[m]> <Guest35013 "I didnt have the image"> Download the stock image and flash it
00:20:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Guest35013: The process is: Download from developers.google.com/android/images, then go to flash.android.com and install using Google's installer
00:21:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Make sure you have the correct image, you back up, etc
00:21:37 <akc3n[m]> That's why the instructions in https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os clearly state that "Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process described above". And to get the factory images, you have to download them. Either buy searching for google pixel stock os factory images, or by going to https://developers.google.com/android/images and then following the
00:21:37 <akc3n[m]> instructions from the last step
00:22:21 <inf_user[m]> Hi Is there any list of phones that are unofficially supported
00:22:28 <came2complain[m]> Assuming that an adversary with physical access, unlimited amount of time and resources will eventually get access to the phone what is the best way of safely deleting data of the device? I consider writing a script that overwrites free space when the phone is charging and idle.
00:22:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Guest35013: And obviously, make sure you've done all the prerequisites for installing GrapheneOS, just apply those same principles to installing stock

00:23:17 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: The easiest way is simply to erase the profile the data was in. That will render the data it  contained permanently unrecoverable.

00:26:04 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: Just delete the profile, and don't use the owner profile except for anything except managing other profiles and turning the device on. Due to the way that SSDs overprovision, simply writing garbage data to the SSD won't necessarily do what you want it to do, and will probably have you buying a new phone just about every year.

00:26:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> came2complain: while having to reinstall every app is a pain, it's much better than risking the adversary getting data (perhaps by forcing you to unlock) or you die
00:26:49 <came2complain[m]> I can't reinstall the apps
00:26:57 <came2complain[m]> it doesn't work for me - I'd lose all contacts.
00:27:04 <bearbyte[m]> A feature like typing a special "reset all data password" would be nice.
00:27:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> came2complain: You could certainly use cloud storage and encrypt any data you want to keep, but that depends on the adversary not knowing about that
00:27:33 <came2complain[m]> I can't use cloud storage.
00:27:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If they know about it, you're f'ed
00:27:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> came2complain: Well, there's not really any other solution I know of
00:27:52 <TheJollyRoger> inf_user[m]: There is no list of phones that are unofficially supported. If you'd like to port GrapheneOS to a device that it does not officially support, you're more than welcome to and we welcome contributions! But unfortunately, you're on your own for that, especially if there are no other devices that meet or exceed the security properties of the Pixels while still allowing for third-party
00:27:54 <TheJollyRoger> rekeying of the bootloader.
00:28:03 <akc3n[m]> Ahoy, Matey TheJollyRoger üëã
00:28:06 <came2complain[m]> so why does overwriting all empty space not work in that scenario?
00:28:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy akc3n[m]!
00:28:13 <Railgun_Lover[m]> came2complain: It does
00:28:21 <came2complain[m]> let's say I run the script twice a week.
00:28:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> came2complain: But you want to keep certain data
00:28:31 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: Because SSDs often overprovision.
00:28:34 <came2complain[m]> what I keep is not "empty space"
00:28:41 <Thatcher[m]> üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
00:28:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <came2complain[m] "so why does overwriting all empt"> Oh wait I misunderstood this
00:29:17 <TheJollyRoger> So as a result, SSDs can actually hold significantly more than what they otherwise say they do, they just rotate old blocks out of use when the SSD's onboard controller determines them to be unviable.
00:29:47 <TheJollyRoger> These blocks often will contain data remnance. This is why GrapheneOS does not allow you to turn the encryption off, and the reasoning for the security chip.
00:29:54 <came2complain[m]> My app safes it's data in a dynamic encrypted db. It uses whatever it needs. The rest is empty space imho... so if I delete my chatlogs the space will eventually be freed up. With the next "wipe run" it should be overwritten.
00:30:03 <TheJollyRoger> You're not listening.
00:30:12 <came2complain[m]> If I do this twice a week the oldest logs that could ever be recovered are 4 days old.
00:31:02 <TheJollyRoger> But oh well. You do you.
00:32:06 <came2complain[m]> is there no way to "force" a ssd to not over provision?
00:33:17 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: There is, if you're alright with it randomly burning out and then eating your data wholesale... and you have access to the vendor's signing keys.
00:33:39 <TheJollyRoger> This is why SSDs are overprovisioned. If they weren't, the moment there's a bad sector, poof.
00:34:44 <came2complain[m]> and if I overwrite all free space and delete it again - wouldn't that also count eventually overwrite ALL data anyway? rotation or not, over-provisioning or not?
00:34:45 <TheJollyRoger> SSDs don't work like a conventional hard drive that stores bits. Flash memory is extremely inexact, and what's written to memory is an *approximation* of what you're writing to it. The SSD's onboard computer then pretends to the operating system that it's a hard drive, while performing transparent error correctiond, checksumming, and parity.
00:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: No.
00:35:42 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: In order to understand an SSD, you need to think of an SSD less as a bag you put things into, and a large reel of paper being rolled past a window.
00:36:19 <TheJollyRoger> By looking out the window, you get the *illusion* of a sheet of paper.
00:36:29 <came2complain[m]> if i burn the part I see through the window every once in a while eventually all paper will be burnt...
00:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> that's not your decision to make. That's the SSD's onboard computer.
00:36:46 <TheJollyRoger> The host has nothing to do with that.
00:36:56 <TheJollyRoger> So if you want to do that, the answer to do it, is thermate.
00:37:10 <TheJollyRoger> Or you can just delete the profile, which erases the keys used to encrypt data to that partition.
00:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> This is why we have hardware bound encryption on GrapheneOS and why hardware bound encryption is so important.
00:37:54 <TheJollyRoger> Because this is the mitigation for the situation you're describing.
00:37:59 <TheJollyRoger> And this is how you deal with it.
00:38:38 <came2complain[m]> can't the data eventually be bruteforced still? (assuming an adversary with unlimited resources and time)
00:38:57 <came2complain[m]>  * can't the data eventually decrypted with brute force still? (assuming an adversary with unlimited resources and time)
00:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> In the same way someone can brute force an AES key, the universe will just run out of energy before they've made even a measurable amount of progress.
00:40:01 <came2complain[m]> and again - as mentioned before - doing that I'd lose ALL contacts. So I'd have to set up a new account and physically meet up with all contacts again.
00:40:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, this is why there's SeedVault.
00:41:02 <TheJollyRoger> This is why Signal implements their own encrypted backup system, and Seedvault can back up other apps offline provided they opt into backup, encrypted with your recovery seed words.
00:43:34 <bearbyte[m]> Dry to interrupt but while there's a heated discussion I might as well ask my question again before all the pros are gone: Not sure if its a bug I have encountered: Trying to connect to a WiFi I always used to connect to with my grapheneos device. Now it just says "obtaining IP address" and after a while "saved" not resulting in a successful connection. All other devices can connect to this network flawlessly. My
00:43:34 <bearbyte[m]> grapheneos device also could but randomly it stopped working. I tried forgetting the network and typing the password again same issue. Also what might be interesting is that I cannot connect my grapheneos device to a WiFi repeater that is connected to that router... Does anyone know what's going on? I can connect to all other WiFi hotspots.
00:43:45 <bearbyte[m]> sry*
00:44:26 <TheJollyRoger> Hello bearbyte[m], not sure, WiFi works for me.
00:45:30 <GhostSplinterSix> WiFi is working fine for me.
00:46:56 <bearbyte[m]> Yeah for me as well on every other hotspot but one. Its really weird. Probably something wrong with the hotspots configuration but all other devices seem to work fine with it. Thx anyways.
00:53:11 <came2complain[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This is why Signal implements th"> maybe the safest way is to use a messenger that doesn't store the messages anywhere but in the ram :D
00:55:32 <acronym[m]> bearbyte: I have seen this lots in the past on Android in general, never on GOS however.
00:55:32 <acronym[m]> Whenever it did happen to me back in the day it always ended up being a router issue.
00:55:32 <acronym[m]> Internet search will give you many things to try.
01:02:15 <Elementoshi[m]> If I decide I don't like GrapheneOS, how hard is it to restore a Google Pixel back to factory installation?
01:02:50 <Elementoshi[m]> I'm asking because I finally just bought a 4a! \o/
01:02:53 <strcat[m]> bearbyte: sounds like your Wi-Fi network is broken
01:02:56 <strcat[m]> try clearing DHCP tables
01:03:08 <strcat[m]> maybe it's broken and doesn't clear entries to make room for new ones
01:03:10 <strcat[m]> and ran out of space
01:03:23 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: not hard
01:03:48 <strcat[m]> it's essentially the same thing as installing GrapheneOS, with the addition of needing to click a button to wipe our verified boot key (optional) if you want it fully back to the original state
01:04:57 <Elementoshi[m]> Awesome!
01:06:03 <Elementoshi[m]> Now if only there a way to get Moto Gestures on a Pixel
01:06:05 <Elementoshi[m]> There were*

01:06:19 <came2complain[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This is why Signal implements th"> Would it be possible to backup application data to another user profile? so it never leaves the device?
01:09:53 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: Seedvault backs up the data encrypted. The seed phrase should never leave your device except copied down onto a sheet of paper with a pen.
01:10:07 <TheJollyRoger> So it doesn't really matter.
01:10:32 <TheJollyRoger> The seed phrase lives in one of two places: either on your device, or on a sheet of paper you copy down with nothing more than an ordinary pen.
01:10:51 <came2complain[m]> the issue in my case is that I have no way of transferring data off my device.
01:11:47 <TheJollyRoger> You do. You can copy the seedvault backups to or even have them exist on a USB drive, or you can copy them off onto your desktop by connecting it to a USB drive. Seedvault saves a copy of the apks, then backs up their data encrypted.
01:12:24 <Elementoshi[m]> <Elementoshi[m] "Now if only there a way to get M"> Or at least an app for shaking my phone to switch the flashlight, that doesn't have ads and Google Analytics in it
01:12:42 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault even supports backup to nextcloud. Because the seed phrase should only exist stored on a sheet of paper in your physical control, the confidentialtity of the backup data is assured by the mathematical guarantee of the encryption, and the physical safety of that sheet of paper.
01:12:44 <came2complain[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You do. You can copy the seedvau"> My device is modified to not support file transfer via nfc, bt, usb it also doesn't allow adb etc.
01:12:58 <TheJollyRoger> came2complain[m]: Well, then you're on your own.
01:13:27 <came2complain[m]> But if I could backup to the device owner account and restore from there to a new user profile that might work.
01:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: the flashlight can be turned on via your quick access panel on GrapheneOS. An exception exists to allow this to be done even when the device is locked.
01:17:09 <TheJollyRoger> It's less convenient than simply shaking your phone or using a key press combination, but it is implemented and working completely fine right now.
01:31:33 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "came2complain: Just delete the p"> If i use the secondary profile as my main, then what happens to the owner profile? Will it still be able to make outside connections?
01:33:46 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: If you have installed nothing into the owner profile, there's nothing to worry about that will.
01:34:35 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: GrapheneOS makes some default connections to detect captive portals, check the time, and check for updates. These are detailed on the FAQ.
01:35:39 <came2complain[m]> can the owner profile access keys of another user profle via the android key sotre??
01:36:24 <came2complain[m]>  * can the owner profile access keys of another user profile via the android key store??
01:36:27 <TheJollyRoger> No.
01:37:43 <came2complain[m]> could a user profile export its keys temporarily to the owner profile in order to back up an apps data when deleting a profile and creating a new one? :D
01:38:23 <TheJollyRoger> I don't get why you're so interested in making Sacrifices to the Great and Terrible Machine Spirits.
01:42:39 <TheJollyRoger> You seem to be reluctant to reinstall an app, yet seem to be perfectly fine with doing something that would likely result in silent data corruption or catastrophic data loss, or having to replace your phone constantly due to the SSD burning out. You're here on a security focused Android based operating system, but are now essentially asking to knock a great big hole into one of the core facets
01:42:41 <TheJollyRoger> of the Android security model.
01:43:32 <came2complain[m]> well... I'd be totally fine with deleting a user profile and setting up a new one. But with the way the app I use is designed there is no way to back up the account data at the moment. So reinstalling the app means I need to add every single contact again. And that works only when meeting face to face.
01:46:23 <TheJollyRoger> In that case, I think you're going to need to talk to the app's publisher and ask them, or if the app is open source, submit a patch to allow for encrypted out-of-band backups, the way Signal does.
01:47:07 <TheJollyRoger> This, when done properly, is far more secure than essentially destroying half if not more of the core Android security model to just to save a bit of convenience.
01:47:48 <TheJollyRoger> Or having you buy a new phone every time your SSD fills because you've disabled overprovisioning and now have no more wear blocks.
01:47:52 <came2complain[m]> I have no intention to compromise the security model. That's why I ask my questions...
01:47:58 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Cliff: GrapheneOS makes some def"> Ok so maybe just a vpn in owner profile, but as i use the secondary profile will it still make those connections in owner profile?
01:48:00 <came2complain[m]> I'm researching

01:52:20 <Cliff[m]> Ok thnx i remember reading a while back about the updater only working in owner profile i believe. So if i use second profile as main I would like those connections to be over a VPN. Does anyone know about this?
01:56:55 <akc3n[m]> <Cliff[m] "Ok thnx i remember reading a whi"> You'd need a VPN in the owner profile then.
02:00:45 <strcat[m]> you should always set up the VPN in each profile with how it works right now
02:00:48 <strcat[m]> just use the same one for the time being
02:01:07 <strcat[m]> eventually we want to support having different VPN configuration active at the same time for each profile
02:01:18 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
02:24:49 <Cliff[m]> Alright thanks, would 2 profiles using vpn count as 2 devices being connected to my vpn? Or do they look as one connection?
02:29:48 <strcat[m]> Cliff: the active profile sets the overall VPN
02:29:51 <strcat[m]> there aren't actually per-profile VPNs yet
02:30:00 <strcat[m]> it's just configured by the active profile like the rest of the network settings

10:50:08 <alex-resist> If you're in that situation, a good approach is to not use messengers linked to your real identity. Number based messengers like Signal or WhatsApp are not a good idea because they make it very easy to send you a malicious message. SMS even more. If the attacker doesn't know how to reach you, you have created one more hurdle.
10:50:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> Like stealth sms
10:51:02 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No SIMs, less attack surface
10:51:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no phone == less attack surface
10:51:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> I know I only use wickr and Threema
10:51:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> Exactly
10:52:05 <freewilzy> But if you register signal messenger to a different number than your phone number, is that safer?
10:52:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> To be honest I don‚Äôt like encrypted apps who requires phone numbers
10:52:59 <alex-resist> freewilzy if you don't make that number public, yes. At least in the sense of creating one more hurdle
10:53:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> security by obscurity? ü§î
10:53:59 <freewilzy> And what aboit using the phone in airplane mode, connected to a second device that is only used for hotspot, or if they hack the hotspot devide they can easily also hack the device connected to it?
10:54:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS assumes the network is hostile
10:54:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> Yes that is a better way to use
10:55:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> therefore GrapheneOS <-> hotspot <-> Internet is essentially the same as GrapheneOS <-> Internet
10:55:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if i understood it correctly
10:56:19 <alex-resist> Using a hotspot means that your phone's IMEI is not exposed to the carrier, which can be desired in certain situations
10:56:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
10:56:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> Exactly
10:57:49 <freewilzy> So it s fair to say if i use 1 grapheneos device always on airplane mode and connect it to another grapheneos device and use that device only for providing a hotspot that i would reduce attack survice?
10:58:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i would say no
10:59:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but, it depends on your threat model
10:59:20 <freewilzy> Hmmm, so there is no way to use internet and be safe from those exploits
11:00:45 <mkinitbtcio[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Cliff: If you have installed not"> Just want to double check I've got this right. When I change to a separate user profile are any other user profiles or the owner profile still running in the background and able to make network connections?
11:00:52 <alex-resist> You're never safe from exploits
11:01:38 <alex-resist> But avoiding the cellular network, avoiding SIM cards, using airplane mode and obscure, not-number-based messengers will certainly reduce attack surface a lot
11:01:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yea, just put your phone in an airplane mode, disable all wireless comms like wifi and bluetooth, and put it in a faraday cage /s
11:01:44 <freewilzy> But why would it be safer to use airplane mode with wifi, because my wifi provider can also locate me and detect me right? Whats the diffrence between wifi at home and mobile carrier ?
11:01:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read the faq
11:02:24 <alex-resist> Wifi is a completely different story, especially on GrapheneOS
11:04:02 <freewilzy> Can you explain please in a way i can understand, i am not super smart with tech
11:04:31 <alex-resist> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
11:04:55 <alex-resist> Pretty much the opposite of "cellular privacy"
11:05:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if you want to understand more, read the books
11:06:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is difficult to answer these questions better than it's already done in faq
11:07:11 <freewilzy> Okey
11:07:30 <freewilzy> Thanks everyone for responding
11:09:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> we can suggest you ways how to preserve your privacy and security
11:09:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but you would need to state your threat model and use cases
11:11:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> because using a smartphone without connecting it to the internet is, at the very least, not-so-handy
11:15:58 <freewilzy> Yess i know, but somehow i always have the feeling being more anonymous using a burner sim card than my home wifi
11:16:10 <freewilzy> But i was wrong i of understood it right
11:16:18 <alex-resist> Don't mix up privacy, anonymity and security
11:18:17 <alex-resist> Your GrapheneOS device will be mostly anonymous. But if you open certain websites after authenticating to your home WiFi, that is visible to your provider. You should use Orbot or a VPN to protect your phone's connection from local observers
11:18:49 <dazinism> freewilzy: its complex theres lots to consider. It depends who you want to be private from. Who you are worried may attack you
11:19:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You can use Orbot*
11:19:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> "Should" - is up to a threat model
11:19:29 <dazinism> Having a sim card in the phone and using the cell network is fine for many peoples situation
11:19:52 <dazinism> i expect most people using grapheneOS do that
11:20:57 <dazinism> I do
11:21:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> +
11:22:40 <freewilzy> I am using vpn, that cannot be combined woth orbot?
11:23:21 <freewilzy> I have to choose orbot or vpn right?
11:24:30 <alex-resist> I think currently it's not possible to use Orbot and another VPN app as full device VPNs simultaneously. Also this usually doesn't make much sense
11:24:47 <dazinism> There are ways to use both, but its generally not advised unless you know exactly what you are doing and how everything works
11:25:03 <dazinism> Its easy to shoot yourself in the foot
11:25:06 <freewilzy> dazinism: i want to be private from the government agency, thats the most difficult
11:25:42 <dazinism> Yeah that is the most difficult
11:25:46 <freewilzy> Yes and because i dont know what i m doing i will stick to vpn
11:26:49 <alex-resist> Some more information and links: https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/vpns.html
11:30:35 <alex-resist> Another opinion: https://medium.com/@thegrugq/tor-and-its-discontents-ef5164845908
11:32:26 <freewilzy> Oke thanks everyone , it s hard because there are many different opinions
11:33:16 <alex-resist> Exactly. You have to find out yourself what suits you best
11:44:57 <GhostSplinterSix> <alex-resist "I think currently it's not possi"> Correct. Both will not run simultaneously.
12:23:37 <M7777777y[m]> Does graphene have a way to use tor with apps in a leak proof manner, i e, if tor stops working it will function like a killswitch instead of leaking your ip
12:24:21 <M7777777y[m]> Because my friend is saying they are having leaks with orbot on regular android
12:25:50 <M7777777y[m]> It would be good if certain apps can be set to "never connect through anything other than tor"
12:25:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Covered in the faq
12:26:40 <M7777777y[m]> Oh ok checking
12:27:23 <M7777777y[m]> " An app providing a VPN service can also be set as the always-on VPN via the entry in the Settings page. For app-based VPN implementations, there's also an additional "Block connections without VPN" toggle which is needed to prevent leaks when the app's VPN service isn't running."
12:27:38 <M7777777y[m]> I'm guessing in this case VPN also could mean orbot?
12:27:49 <GhostSplinterSix> Yep.
12:28:13 <GhostSplinterSix> Go to the VPN settings, select Orbot and then click on the gear icon.
12:28:34 <M7777777y[m]> Nice, I don't have graphene yet though
12:28:42 <M7777777y[m]> Waiting on a device for it
12:28:58 <GhostSplinterSix> That's fine. I was just providing guidance.
12:29:22 <M7777777y[m]> My friend has a pixel though and might switch soon
12:29:43 <GhostSplinterSix> Bring them to the lighttttt. üòé

13:28:25 <M7777777y[m]> Still don't feel good about buying a google phone even if it's degoogled :P
13:32:41 <evoran[m]> Fair. There's definitely something to that, plus with the e-waste issue I personally try to buy used
13:34:46 <sign4l[m]> <M7777777y[m] "Still don't feel good about buyi"> had the same problems.. but I bought the Pixel4a ... unpacked it and installed graphene os. Best decision in my life!

13:36:39 <sign4l[m]>  * had the same problems.. but I bought the Pixel4a ... unpacked it and installed graphene os. Best decision of my life!
13:39:31 <alex-resist> Phones are a bit overrated in terms of e-waste
13:40:02 <alex-resist> People buy electric cars and 50" TVs and are worried that their 150g phones might become e-waste at some point...
13:40:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <alex-resist "People buy electric cars and 50""> Phones have more exotic metals, etc
13:40:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And you use your mentioned electronics far longer than phones
13:41:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Phones are definitely worse
13:41:25 <alex-resist> What exotic metals are used in a phone that are not used in a Tesla?
13:41:53 <alex-resist> Especially considering that a Tesla is essentially a huge phone with wheels?
13:41:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> over-consumption is a problem
13:42:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but this is off-topic
13:42:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> has really nothing to do with GrapheneOS
13:42:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> has really nothing to do"> Yeah you're right, going to off topic
13:42:48 <alex-resist> Well, it kinda does, since we're coming from the question what environmental impact the acquisition of a new phone for GrapheneOS has
13:42:55 <alex-resist> But yeah we can continue elsewhere
13:53:59 <xd4e[m]> Anyone ever tried to include tor in the system so it could be called in the shell ?
13:54:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Konrad (@d‚Äãvd_rw) has joined the Telegram Group!
13:56:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> Hey! Is there any way to speed up notification on graphene? Many people cant call me via telegram foss. One time i set up timer for 5min, and timer starts ringing after 8min, saying "i'm not turning timer of from -3min"
13:56:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> xd4e[m]: please read the rules, your question is off-topic
13:58:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You should switch to the official telegram client, as Telegram FOSS falls behind on security updates
13:58:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Also this might or might not fix your notifications issue
14:03:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> what about timer, included in system?
14:07:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i don't know, try using a different timer app
14:07:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you sure you don't have battery saver turned on?
14:09:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> i disabled it for telegram
14:10:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i mean the global battery saver toggle
14:12:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> I cant find it
14:12:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Settings -> Battery -> Battery Saver
14:13:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or in the notification tiles
14:14:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> oh, I can see. It is disabled by default, and it's turning on below 25% of battery
14:14:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> keep it turned off forever
14:14:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> I have the same feeling right now
14:14:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> only use it when you're in a critical situation to preserve battery life
14:15:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> i have over 80% of battery, and still today my mom couldn't connect with me on telegram
14:15:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> battery saver kills most of the background tasks, even alarms
14:16:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> oh, good to know
14:16:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> again
14:16:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãvd_rw> where can I find it?

14:30:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hi!
14:30:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> currently there is no support for eSIM in GrapheneOS
14:31:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is a planned feature, but it's unknown when it will be ready
14:32:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/159
14:36:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <j‚Äãosebermejo> Many thanks for the info. I'll take a look on this.
14:37:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you're welcome!
14:52:19 <xd4e[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> xd4e: please read the ru"> It's about development, this seems pretty on-topic
14:54:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> one can install/use Orbot and set it up so that everything would go thru Tor network
14:55:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or i didn't understood your question, and you may want to elaborate

14:55:36 <ramenweekend[m]> Dumb question: I can't seem to save a new APN because it's populated with random APNs. How do I get around this?
14:55:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> * didn't understand (thnx jj1013)
14:56:55 <xd4e[m]> You diidn't understand the question. I'd like to have tor installed as a system-library like you would on a standard linux distro
14:57:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, why would you do that?
15:00:38 <xd4e[m]> To use tor as a sytem-wide transparent proxy. I find Orbot kinda of slow and buggy. Plus, having it in the sytem would mean less work for the user and alse probably better security.
15:02:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS project would never bundle unsafe apps
15:03:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> actually, this explains it better: https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
15:05:54 <xd4e[m]> im not talking about an app nor bundling it in the main project
15:06:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> welp, in this case, afaik, no one did this before
15:07:57 <GhostSplinterSix> Orbot is slow(er) for obvious reasons.
15:08:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, it doesn't really matter if it is an app or a library, afaik
15:10:54 <ramenweekend[m]> I came in at a bad time.
15:11:34 <xd4e[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Orbot is slow(er) for obvious re"> I meant the app itself is slow, not the tor network
15:11:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sorry ramenweekend, i'm not knowledgeable ebough to help you
15:12:44 <ramenweekend[m]> It's all good Hulk. I haven't tested MMS yet. Slow and steadily setting up phone.

18:21:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (facepalm)
18:21:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> unfortunately, at this point i cannot be sure how to help you
18:22:13 <blaqkbsd[m]> Following the FAQ as is. Docs didn't mention this
18:22:28 <blaqkbsd[m]> Would rebooting be risky?
18:22:33 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: You're lucky. You haven't bricked it, but you could have. You tried to flash the wrong image
18:22:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i am not qualified enough, you might want to wait for someone more knowledgeable than me
18:22:44 <blaqkbsd[m]> So I just download the bramble zip with the same procedure
18:23:12 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: No, rebooting isn't risky. You just don't have an OS to boot into. You can boot into the bootloader interface again
18:24:43 <blaqkbsd[m]> <nscnt[m] "bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: You're lucky. "> Thank god it reboots back into Fastboot
18:24:50 <blaqkbsd[m]> I need the other zip
18:25:08 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: Yes, you're lucky that you have the 4a _5G_
18:25:20 <blaqkbsd[m]> Procedure with bramble is exact the same right
18:29:19 <blaqkbsd[m]> Reason why I don't use web is that my connection is slow. Takes 1 hour to download the zip. Sucks if it hangs. And my Edge is tightened up not allowing USB and lots of tweaks. Shell is more reliable
18:30:06 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: Were you in incognito?
18:30:20 <blaqkbsd[m]> <nscnt[m] "bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: Yes, you're lu"> Would it have bricked with 5 series?
18:31:08 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: redfin is Pixel 5. Every other device would've been bricked
18:32:04 <nscnt[m]> the "normal" 4a would've been bricked
18:32:10 <blaqkbsd[m]> <nscnt[m] "bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: Were you in in"> No I have over 100 registry keys changed on Windows 10 , many Edge related. Its not a privacy friendly platform (understatement)
18:32:10 <nscnt[m]> and any other
18:33:00 <blaqkbsd[m]> <nscnt[m] "bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: redfin is Pixe"> It says "Update requires redfin" after running the installer
18:33:32 <blaqkbsd[m]> But I'm going to install bramble hm
18:34:02 <nscnt[m]> yes, because you don't have redfin
18:36:28 <blaqkbsd[m]> Silly question that :) What benefit has the ota_update zip? (from to what version). Curiosity question
18:39:20 <blaqkbsd[m]> <nscnt[m] "yes, because you don't have redf"> A rerun of the installer with bramble overwrites all partitions, no data of previous write kept in boot, modem, radio and other partitions? Thanks for your help, I should have paid attention and downloaded the right zip in the first run
18:44:05 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: ota_update.zip is the update for sideloading, to the version specified there. You don't need it unless you deliberately choose sideloading. GrapheneOS has its own updater app with delta updates
18:52:38 <blaqkbsd[m]> I turned it off for a while. Getting a lightning bolt symbol and doesn't turn back on?
18:54:30 <blaqkbsd[m]> It was fully charged
18:56:47 <blaqkbsd[m]> <blaqkbsd[m] "I turned it off for a while. Get"> [Solved] Common Pixel issue: 30 sec trick (press power button and hold)
19:09:21 <blaqkbsd[m]> Archive does not contain 'system_ext.sig' , 'system_other.img', 'vendor_dlkm.img', 'vendor_other.img' is normal in the script output? All OKAY now
19:25:32 <nscnt[m]> bÃálÃîaÕÇqÃîkÕ°bÃäsÃÖdÃè: Yes, normal
19:50:00 <applejuice543[m]> i need some help with graphene
19:55:22 <applejuice543[m]> nscnt:  i need some help with installing graphene os
19:57:14 <missfire[m]> applejuice543: hey, not an expert, but could you please elaborate about the problem?
19:57:35 <applejuice543[m]> i am trying to install graphene via the web usb
19:57:45 <applejuice543[m]> and it is not working
19:57:55 <missfire[m]> what browser are you using?
19:58:03 <applejuice543[m]> edge
19:58:37 <missfire[m]> could you try with chrome / chromium?
19:58:45 <applejuice543[m]> yeah
19:58:52 <missfire[m]> I know edge is chromium based, but still..
19:59:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <n‚Äãottheenddotinfo> Just for info: if u start with stock ROM and enable esim there it could work. An workaround exists, it is mentioned in some issue.However, no guaranteed function
20:00:05 <missfire[m]> <applejuice543[m] "edge"> for me it is working with edge, so I'm not sure, what exactly not working?
20:00:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <n‚Äãottheenddotinfo> This one: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/159
20:01:23 <applejuice543[m]> no
20:01:28 <applejuice543[m]> the device is not shwoing up
20:01:31 <applejuice543[m]> on web usb
20:03:48 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: Are you booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the computer?
20:05:09 <applejuice543[m]> no
20:05:16 <applejuice543[m]> i cant get into the bootloader
20:07:20 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: There are several ways. Try: Turn off your phone. After that, hold down the power and volume down button until you're booted into the bootloader interface. Release the power button first, then the volume down button.
20:07:34 <applejuice543[m]> ok what do i do when i am in hte bootloder
20:07:47 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: Connect to your computer
20:08:00 <applejuice543[m]> then?
20:08:41 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: Read the paragraph for Windows at https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone and proceed from there
20:09:02 <applejuice543[m]> yeah but when i try to click the unlock bootloader button the device does not show up
20:09:52 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: You are probably missing the necessary driver, which is why I asked you to read the paragraph about it
20:10:04 <applejuice543[m]> yes i checkled the update
20:10:05 <applejuice543[m]> not there
20:12:56 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: Are you in the bootloader interface and connected now?
20:13:26 <jj1013[m]> nscnt: can I DM?
20:13:49 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: Have you checked for the updates AFTER you booted into the bootloader interface and connected your phone to your computer?
20:14:05 <nscnt[m]> jj1013.: Yes
20:14:15 <jj1013[m]> OK
20:15:46 <applejuice543[m]> <nscnt[m] "applejuice543: Have you checked "> yes
20:17:49 <applejack22[m]> Hey guys, few questions, my install didn't come with a calendar, and was also wondering about Google play system update in the phone settings and if that's normal, sorry not the most tech savvy and couldn't find anything online
20:19:18 <jj1013[m]> <applejack22[m] "Hey guys, few questions, my inst"> GrapheneOS has no calendar. You can install one on F-Droid or wherever you want to get it.
20:20:55 <applejack22[m]> Okay thanks, I saw some install videos that seemed to already have one so was confused
20:21:05 <applejuice543[m]> nsct us still there?
20:21:10 <flawedworld[m]> <applejack22[m] "Hey guys, few questions, my inst"> Google Play system update refers to APEX updates delivered by the Google Play store on GMS devices. GrapheneOS does not bundle GMS and flattens APEX, meaning the 11 here just refers to the Android version.
20:21:17 <jj1013[m]> <applejack22[m] "Okay thanks, I saw some install "> They're outdated. Please don't follow them.
20:22:32 <applejuice543[m]> nscnt:  what do you think the problenm is?
20:22:36 <applejack22[m]> Awesome, thanks for the explanation, really enjoying the os too! üòÅ
20:23:37 <flawedworld[m]> <applejack22[m] "Awesome, thanks for the explanat"> If you are interested about the technical details of APEX, you may read the official AOSP documentation for it here: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/apex
20:28:01 <applejuice543[m]> can i get some help
20:28:02 <applejuice543[m]> ?
20:29:43 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: If you don't see any updates under "optional updates", you may already have them. Have you tried in the past already? The device should be displayed in the dialog that opens when you press the button. It doesn't?
20:30:05 <applejuice543[m]> how do i check if i have them?
20:30:26 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: Update history
20:30:36 <Cliff[m]> <applejack22[m] "Hey guys, few questions, my inst"> I use simple calendar pro from f droid, works great.
20:30:55 <applejuice543[m]> ok
20:31:01 <applejuice543[m]> welll it looks like i dont have them
20:31:53 <applejuice543[m]> but they dont show up
20:32:16 <nscnt[m]> applejuice543: You don't see anything in the update history under "Driver updates"? Something like "LeMobile - ... - Android Bootloader Interface"
20:32:56 <applejuice543[m]> wait
20:33:11 <applejuice543[m]> the usb settings
20:33:18 <applejuice543[m]> are set to no data transfer
20:33:26 <applejuice543[m]> what do i put the settings to
20:33:27 <nscnt[m]> ?
20:33:34 <nscnt[m]> Are you booted in the OS?
20:33:37 <applejuice543[m]> yes
20:33:55 <nscnt[m]> You shouldn't, though
20:33:56 <applejuice543[m]> do i use file transger usb tethering or midi or ptp
20:34:00 <nscnt[m]> No
20:34:08 <nscnt[m]> Follow the guide
20:34:34 <applejuice543[m]> i have tried following the guide
20:34:37 <applejuice543[m]> but it does not work
20:35:48 <nscnt[m]> It can only work if you are booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the pc. This is a prerequisite, whatever the problem is
20:36:25 <applejuice543[m]> i jsut need oem unlocking not usb debugging right?
20:36:34 <nscnt[m]> Yes
20:36:39 <applejuice543[m]> ok so
20:36:42 <applejuice543[m]> so
20:36:48 <applejuice543[m]> 1. get into the boot loder
20:36:51 <applejuice543[m]> 2.
20:37:00 <applejuice543[m]> connect
20:37:06 <applejuice543[m]> 3. press the button
20:37:12 <applejuice543[m]> this is correct?
20:37:51 <nscnt[m]> 3. should be: check for updates on Windows now and install the driver updates
20:38:11 <applejuice543[m]> then press button
20:38:14 <applejuice543[m]> ?
20:38:15 <nscnt[m]> The order is important
20:38:57 <applejuice543[m]> will the provided usb c to usb c cable work (from the box)
20:39:50 <applejuice543[m]> or does it have to be a to c
20:40:13 <nscnt[m]> Depends on the port of your PC
20:40:45 <nscnt[m]> Connection problems due to the cable/port usually only occur during flashing
20:41:00 <applejuice543[m]> ok
20:41:04 <applejuice543[m]> i am goign to try this
20:41:05 <applejuice543[m]> brb
20:42:06 <POL> Hello, brand new Grapheneos user with quick question if that's OK.
20:43:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hi POL, sure thing!
20:43:39 <POL> Is it possible to set the auto updates to occur over WiFi only and not cell data?
20:45:27 <nscnt[m]> POL: Unmetered. WiFi can also be marked as metered, but that should do it for most
20:45:28 <applejuice543[m]> yeah seems not to work nscnt

22:10:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i know)
22:10:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is the installation going well?)
22:11:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Is graphene now using its own time Server by default?
22:11:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> by default - yes
22:11:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Niceüëç
22:12:04 <blaqkbsd[m]> <applejuice543[m] "cant wait to use graphene os"> I used it on a  Pix 2 but things changed a little. I'm installing one for my boss now and getting my own next week
22:14:15 <blaqkbsd[m]> Who can tell me where the system stores thumbs of app selector previews or are these kept in mem?
22:14:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> what is an app selector preview?
22:15:01 <bambam_666[m]> Can I use  graphene os only on a pixel ? Or ca I use other fhone‚Äôs!

22:22:30 <applejuice543[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> is it stuck there?"> yes
22:22:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> how long have it been like this?
22:23:19 <applejuice543[m]> 1 min
22:23:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> give it 2 more mins, if nothing happens, write here
22:24:08 <applejuice543[m]> ok
22:26:51 <applejuice543[m]> still at it
22:26:58 <applejuice543[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg:

22:27:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> start over
22:27:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hey apple, is your 4a new?
22:27:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or is it used?
22:27:53 <applejuice543[m]> but the bar is full
22:27:59 <applejuice543[m]> new
22:28:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> restart your 4a
22:29:27 <applejuice543[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> restart your 4a"> i did it still not working
22:29:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> did it boot to the OS?
22:29:46 <_[m]3> remove the battery
22:29:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or did it failed to boot?
22:30:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> lmao _[m]3
22:30:04 <applejuice543[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> or did it failed to boot"> booted into stock os
22:30:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> now that is very strange
22:31:04 <applejuice543[m]> but i locked the bootloader
22:31:08 <applejuice543[m]> annd did the rest of the steps
22:31:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> can you double check if OEM unlocking is on?
22:31:22 <applejuice543[m]> yeah
22:31:24 <applejuice543[m]> it is on
22:31:32 <blaqkbsd[m]> <bambam_666[m] "Can I use  graphene os only on a"> Device list is documented on the website (Supported and Recommended)
22:31:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> alright let's go together step-by-step
22:32:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but first, what's the battery level?
22:32:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> on both 4a and s10?
22:32:27 <applejuice543[m]> 50 and 20
22:32:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> charge them
22:32:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> make at least 80 both
22:32:59 <applejuice543[m]> ok
22:33:05 <applejuice543[m]> but when i sleected lock bootloader
22:33:09 <applejuice543[m]> the prevuios step
22:33:14 <applejuice543[m]> said unpcking raidio
22:33:22 <applejuice543[m]> then said device disconnected
22:33:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> welp, we will go thru all of it again
22:33:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but together
22:34:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so that no mistakes would be made
22:34:13 <applejuice543[m]> ok
22:34:20 <applejuice543[m]> i need to go eat tho
22:34:36 <applejuice543[m]> will be like 15-20 min

22:36:11 <applejuice543[m]> ok
22:36:14 <applejuice543[m]> so lets start
22:36:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> anyway, you should charge your devices
22:36:28 <applejuice543[m]> yeah
22:36:40 <applejuice543[m]> i will ping u when they are full
22:36:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sure!
23:06:48 <daiyomon[m]> yo guys
23:06:54 <daiyomon[m]> thinking about getting pixel 3a
23:06:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sup
23:06:59 <daiyomon[m]> isnt it the one with long exec times
23:07:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is
23:07:27 <daiyomon[m]> ok
23:07:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> because it has a crappy storage system
23:07:32 <daiyomon[m]> o
23:07:34 <daiyomon[m]> hmm
23:07:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> basically it doesn't come with SSD
23:07:54 <daiyomon[m]> what does it run on, microsd
23:07:55 <daiyomon[m]> lol
23:08:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> afaik, eMMC
23:08:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which is very bad
23:08:47 <daiyomon[m]> hmm
23:08:49 <daiyomon[m]> i dont want to cause a civil war
23:08:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> check this out: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
23:08:51 <daiyomon[m]> ok
23:09:01 <daiyomon[m]> i was looking at it
23:09:05 <daiyomon[m]> i can only get pixel 3a
23:09:24 <daiyomon[m]> is the exec system worth it with pixel 3a for the delay?
23:09:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh, cause money?
23:09:32 <daiyomon[m]> or should i use something without eec
23:09:33 <daiyomon[m]> yes
23:09:38 <daiyomon[m]>  * or should i use something without exec
23:09:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> welp, if i were you
23:10:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> look, exec spawning is not too long, there is  a different problem
23:10:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> pixel 3a will very soon be obsolete
23:10:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> google will stop supporting it soon
23:10:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> The delay is barely noticeable
23:11:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> Literally in the milliseconds
23:11:07 <blaqkbsd[m]> <daiyomon[m] "i was looking at it"> 4x has longer support if you have the option
23:11:07 <daiyomon[m]> its only 2 yrs old..
23:11:31 <daiyomon[m]> i can deal with delay
23:11:42 <Volkoz[m]> <daiyomon[m] "its only 2 yrs old.."> android phones usually get 3 years of support
23:11:43 <daiyomon[m]> what does it matter if google dont support? will graphene stop support too?
23:11:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
23:12:02 <daiyomon[m]> really

23:12:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, GrapheneOS is not LineageOS
23:12:38 <daiyomon[m]> üòï
23:12:54 <daiyomon[m]> so when will they stop support
23:12:59 <daiyomon[m]> in 1 yr?
23:13:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> after May 2022 pixel 3a will not receive guaranteed updates
23:13:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, almost exactly 1 year
23:13:31 <daiyomon[m]> what are the graphene updates for
23:13:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> security, duh
23:14:38 <daiyomon[m]> if it will become updateless in 1yr i might have to find an alternative such as calyx üòï, i wish they didnt make the entry requirements have to be on google
23:14:41 <daiyomon[m]> 's terms
23:14:54 <daiyomon[m]> for supported graphene phones
23:15:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i mean, do whatever you want

23:15:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but if i were you, i would get myself pixel 4a or smth
23:15:42 <daiyomon[m]> would graphene do something similar to this?
23:15:49 <daiyomon[m]> or would they completely cut support
23:16:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that is unknown
