00:02:37 <edsh[m]> Is it just plain Android security?
00:02:47 <natopon> calyx has almost/same security like any other oem android rom because it supports locking bootloader, graphene has hardened malloc and many other hardenings
00:06:23 <edsh[m]> Okay. So my message is correct?
00:15:50 <edsh[m]> Please feed me with more information.
01:13:18 <sphinx[m]> <strcat[m] "@room We're migrating to upgrade"> edsh: nat join the new rooms, see the quoted message, the room description, etc.
01:14:56 <edsh[m]> Thanks.
09:57:23 <strcat> edsh[m]: natopon: no, that's not correct, CalyxOS is significantly less secure than the stock OS and we've identified local and remote code execution vulnerabilities via microG along with the ability for apps to intercept data inbound for other apps
09:57:30 <strcat> this channel is also obsolete, you should be moving to the new channels
09:58:05 <strcat> microG was not very receptive to us reporting these problems when we were initially doing that
09:58:14 <strcat> and we do not provide coordinated disclosure for hostile projects, obviously
09:58:57 <strcat> microG requires the OS to trick other apps into thinking that it is Play services but then it doesn't maintain the security model expected of those APIs
09:59:09 <strcat> allows other apps to provide them with fake data and intercept their data
09:59:15 <strcat> along with having serious, obvious vulnerabilities in their approach
10:00:59 <strcat[m]> @room We're migrating to upgraded Matrix rooms without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos-new:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org . Please join the new rooms and you can leave these legacy ones to stop being bothered by pings.
10:13:40 <strcat> edsh[m]: since CalyxOS doesn't maintain the standard app security model, it will never be supported by Auditor and even if it was, it wouldn't have the intended meaning
10:18:00 <strcat[m]> @room if you've already joined the new Matrix rooms, please leave this one so it's easier to tell how much of the migration is left to go

11:43:39 <rawtaz> &58
12:26:45 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: you can see when I post that it makes people see it and they migrate, I don't know why, I think a lot of people have buggy clients only notifying them if they are actively there using it
12:27:30 <strcat[m]> +s seems to have stopped the false flag bot spam here at least
12:37:26 <rawtaz> ok?
12:37:56 <strcat> don't really understand why you're still here instead of at least on libera.chat
12:38:16 <rawtaz> i am fully on libera :) in many channels
12:38:25 <rawtaz> but i thought you moved everything to matrix, and im not tehre
12:38:56 <rawtaz> i also think you should reevaluate the need for controlling this so much. if people want to move, they will. you dont need to spend your time working so hard to make them move
12:39:03 <rawtaz> but you dont seem to listen to that when i say this :)
12:39:19 <rawtaz> but to answer your pondering, im just here because im not on matrix, basically hehe
12:39:41 <rawtaz> lemme see if theres a grapheneos channel on librea :o
12:39:53 <rawtaz> err. dangit, i always get that name wrong.
12:40:29 <rawtaz> cool there is. i hadnt checked and i didnt know, i thought it was all matrix
12:40:41 <rawtaz> ill go there, and i guess that makes you happier too. cheers!
12:42:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Well, impossible to tell him that it is fragmented, now
12:50:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> I don't know if they read any of the notices strcpy put out lol
12:51:36 <strcat> 08:51:26               -- | Channel #grapheneos: 586 nicks (3 ops, 0 voices, 583 normals)
12:51:44 <strcat> about 50% smaller now
12:51:48 <strcat> here, I mean
12:54:43 <strcat[m]> hoping we can get most people to move over

13:46:15 <interesting[m]> any updates on eSIM?
13:47:41 <strcat[m]> no
13:47:45 <strcat[m]> please move to the new rooms
13:47:50 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-new:matrix.org
13:47:56 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org
13:48:08 <strcat[m]> the old aliases are also moved over but some clients/servers cache them
13:48:28 <interesting[m]> thanks

17:52:20 <abdulshaikhullah> Apologies in advance if I've missed so.ething extremely obvious. Pixel 3a running Graphene. After the recent OS update I no longer have a "back" button where I am accustomed to seeing one, such as in Vanadium. How do I re-enable it?
20:48:21 <sphinx[m]> > strcat made future room history visible to all room members, from the point they joined.
20:48:21 <sphinx[m]> :/
