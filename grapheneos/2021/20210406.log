00:25:00 <strcat> philogy[m]: it's a known issue with some routers that they don't clear out old dhcp entries and have a tiny table for them
00:25:07 <strcat> among other router issues
00:26:06 <rny> this is my first time hearing about dhcp entries not clearing after lease time has expired
00:26:14 <rny> what do the implementors actually expect the router owner to do?
00:26:20 <rny> do a reboot cycle every 24hr?
00:26:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> I wanna suggest something and I'm not sure this is the right place but currently Signify is used for sig verification, is there any reason not using gpg? I couldn't find a detail info about this.
00:29:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> GPG is insecure.
00:30:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> What about GPG2 with hkps or https instead of hkp or http?
00:30:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> Still insecure.
00:31:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> Daniel and other security researchers have written about this in-depth.
00:31:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OpenPGP#Issues_with_PGP
00:32:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> Thanks I haven't kept up with the news so I didn't even know about this
00:45:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> Just a sudden interest, why is it that most projects use sha256 instead of sha512? Is it for 32bit backward compatibility?
00:46:23 <Lynn[m]> osscontrib because a lot of projects use it. And it is secure.
00:46:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> SHA256 is still secure. SHA512 can be unnecessary.
00:47:35 <Lynn[m]> SHA512 is resistant to QCs, and not as hard to fuck up with like SHA256 (length extension attacks).
00:51:40 <strcat[m]> sha256 output is smaller
00:51:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> Ohh I see
00:52:09 <strcat[m]> sha256 is significantly faster on 32-bit, sha512 is a bit faster on 64-bit
00:52:48 <rny> sha3 is the way to go
00:53:09 <strcat[m]> there's a standard sha512/256 which isn't vulnerable to length extension attacks, is the same size as sha256 and is faster on 64-bit
00:53:21 <rny> no length extensions in sponges
00:53:27 <strcat[m]> just not commonly used since people don't know about those and also people care about 32-bit perf
00:59:53 <Lynn[m]> I like BLAKE2b.
01:00:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> I've been reading the issues but I can't find the info that latest gpg is susceptible to MitM other than the fact that DPI hardware can detect PGP/GPG and just know I'm using it.
01:02:28 <rny> would people just use blake instead of sha3 if they could?
01:05:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> Honestly if you're referring to the large population of people, they'll be comfortable using it as long as their distro provides the package without adding an additional repo or having to compile it themselves.
02:03:34 <p0lp0> is there something that i'm supposed to do to enable my SIM card on a pixel 3 from Google Fi?
02:40:36 <entry1[m]> <p0lp0 "is there something that i'm supp"> Physical or eSIM for Google Fi? eSIM isn't supported, but the physical SIM should work without anything needed on your end. Are you getting any functionality?
02:42:22 <p0lp0> i think it's an esim since i don't remember messing with any SIM settings during activation with Google Fi
02:42:42 <p0lp0> i did not remember this detail when flashing my firmware :/
02:42:55 <p0lp0> i did just find this though - https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159#issuecomment-765451235
02:43:50 <p0lp0> seems to be suggesting that if I reflash the factory image and reinstall grapheneOS it may be happier
02:44:53 <p0lp0> entry1[m] now to look for a factory image
02:46:09 <p0lp0> ...and looks like it was already provided for me here - https://grapheneos.org/install/web#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
02:46:30 <p0lp0> you crazy devs, what will ya think of next?? :p
02:54:36 <entry1[m]> Do you have an actual SIM card? You can get one for Google Fi so it will be compatible with the project
02:54:50 <p0lp0> entry1[m] i actually don't
02:55:08 <p0lp0> i didn't think it was even an option with Google Fi-provided pixels
02:56:33 <entry1[m]> It probably wasn't, but you can order one so it'll work for you. Believe it is around $5
02:57:12 <entry1[m]> Nvm, $10. Amazon and Best Buy have them
03:07:34 <p0lp0> too bad i already spent an hour or so setting my phone up :/
03:08:11 <p0lp0> oh well. i wish i could say "live and learn" but i seem to always do it this way and never manage to change my approach no matter what
03:10:04 <p0lp0> entry1[m], apparently Google Fi will just send me one for free
03:10:25 <p0lp0> order a free sim from them here: https://fi.google.com/ordersim
03:23:11 <p0lp0> curious. I seem to have managed to re-flash GrapheneOS.
03:23:51 <p0lp0> though if im not mistaken this seems to be suggesting it put the factory stock OS on there - https://i.imgur.com/v61wYP3.png
03:26:50 <p0lp0> but im definitely in graphene unfortunately
03:33:15 <sphinx[m]> p0lp0: the GrapheneOS web installer is obviously only for installing GrapheneOS
03:44:22 <p0lp0> sphinx[m] I took this to mean that it wasn't - "Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process described above" and managed to confuse myself
03:46:42 <sphinx[m]> p0lp0: https://developers.google.com/android/images#blueline
03:48:52 <sphinx[m]> p0lp0: click 'Flash' next to the latest version (Apr 2021)
03:49:26 <p0lp0> sphinx[m], so the blueline-factory image referenced in the screenshot i posted is not intended to refer to the pixel build, but to a graphene build?
03:51:24 <sphinx[m]> p0lp0: in the screenshot you sent you are obviously reinstalling GrapheneOS
03:52:55 <p0lp0> sphinx[m] so is the answer to my question "yes, grapheneOS uses the same name"?
03:58:22 <sphinx[m]> p0lp0: sure, `blueline` is Pixel 3's codename
03:59:34 <p0lp0> thanks! sphinx[m] for helping me get less confused
04:00:20 <b1101> mms doesn't work on fi
04:02:51 <p0lp0> b1101 good to know

07:20:17 <wiegolf[m]> <philogy[m] "Adjusted the settings so that it"> As I traveled last month I also discovered some WIFIs I could not access the Internet. On one occasion I could investigate and the problem was my DNS setting in GrapheneOS could not been processed by the router. As I changed to another DNS it worked. I use fdns2.dismail.de as my DNS server.
07:21:54 <wiegolf[m]> I have no idea how the router was configured there ...
07:24:51 <wiegolf[m]> But if it is your router I would wireshark the reason...
09:40:30 <fom[m]> <strcat[m] "GrapheneOS 2021.04.05.20 release"> Wow very fast
09:44:01 <kskdj[m]> strcat what do you think about Whitechapel?

12:11:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Lucky you)
12:12:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <philogy[m] "What do I need to configure on m"> It works out of the box usually, unless the router (more often, on work) for some reason does not accept randomized MAC every connection (this is not taking into account hardware failures on either side btw)

12:57:29 <somenerd[m]> yeah, believe that replies ping on matrix
13:00:30 <laggingleg> do chips for mobile connectivity have their own internal (writable) firmware and can this be updated remotely by the provider?
13:22:29 <dazinism> laggingleg: All component firmware is updated with the monthly security updates
13:24:03 <laggingleg> dazinism: so the firmnware is some binary on the emmc flash and part of the OS? and just loaded into the chip *RAM* ?
13:24:24 <laggingleg> iirc i read something about remote updates by the provider, not 100% sure though
13:24:56 <laggingleg> i mean "non voluntary" upgrades in this case ...
13:29:49 <manjaro-user__> Graphene os updates an hour after I try to flash my new pixel 5... I was getting issues about the wrong bootloader, would that be fixed now? My phone says r3-0.3-6873951, the install says I need r3-0.3-7051238.
13:55:53 <dazinism> laggingleg: not sure of the details, guess its either as you suggest or the baseband has its own flash memory which is updated following the OS update.  The component firmware has to be signed by the device vendor (Google).
14:12:49 <manjaro-user--> It boots! Seems it was either my cable or my (new) phone's usbc port. Regardless, holding it a tjust the right position while manually flashing each file seems to have worked.
14:41:30 <philogy[m]> In the settings of my router my phone doesn't seem to have been assigned an IP address, what can I do?
14:43:09 <laggingleg> is there any way to check if other firmware on the device, like the one for emmc,/ufs storage is the original one from the manufacturer? can you dump it somehow ?
15:20:01 <hunter5> should I be able to tell when an update has been installed? I don't get any notifications or anything and I set update networks to any and tried tapping the check for updates field
15:22:19 <nscnt[m]> hunter5: You'll receive a notification in the owner user when your device is waiting for a reboot to apply an update
15:22:35 <nscnt[m]> hunter5: The button doesn't give any feedback at the moment
15:22:51 <helloworldkk87[m> <nscnt[m] "hunter5: You'll receive a notifi"> I didnt.. Usually I do but the last update didnt give that
15:24:21 <hunter5> what is owner user exactly? I didn't set up an account or something
15:24:57 <hunter5> just a notification I guess, ok we will see if I get one then
15:28:15 <nscnt[m]> hunter5: The owner user is the first user added to the device. If you haven't been in contact with multiple users, you probably use the owner/primary user
15:28:28 <rosie> Are there any caveats with installing GrapheneOS under Debian?  I've been trying to get Arch Linux installed on my system, and I think I'm in over my head.  Trying to avoid Ubuntu if I can.
15:29:07 <hunter5> it's a recommended os if you check the installation guide
15:29:32 <rosie> I'm aware of that.  Just wondering whether there are any gotchas I need to be aware of.
15:30:10 <hunter5> nscnt: ok thanks, now I just need to get the dns working...
15:31:31 <hunter5> rosie: I just know that it works fine on qubes/debian
15:32:43 <rosie> Ok, good.  Thinking I may jump the Arch Linux ship in favor of Debian (at least for now).  Personally,  I would prefer Mint, as I'm already familiar with it, but it's not supported by the GrapheneOS install.
15:40:51 <nscnt[m]> helloworldkk87: Which update?
15:49:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hunter5: GrapheneOS updates itself automatically without user interaction
15:49:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the only proper way of knowing that it updated itself (while you were asleep) is by going to settings and checking the build number
15:50:26 <hunter5> well I didn't see no notification, that should tell me reboot to update
15:50:52 <hunter5> I installed blueline yesterday btw
15:50:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it does reboot itself if allowed in settings
15:51:10 <nscnt[m]> hunter5: Probably because there's no update
15:51:28 <hunter5> then what is that ota you can sideload?
15:51:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> OTA - over the air
15:52:07 <hunter5> so is that not an update?
15:52:24 <hunter5> I can see no reboot in my uptime
15:52:36 <nscnt[m]> It is -- for sideloading if you choose to do it this way
15:52:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> It is, and it is over the air (does not require a cable)
15:53:07 <hunter5> off to sideloading it is then
15:53:12 <nscnt[m]> No
15:53:14 <nscnt[m]> What why
15:53:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> pls don't
15:53:21 <hunter5> where is my update lol
15:53:24 <nscnt[m]> Stuff getting mixed it
15:53:27 <nscnt[m]> *here
15:53:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just check the build number
15:54:23 <hunter5> wow I am an idiot, yeah ok
15:54:37 <nscnt[m]> The OTA release is a way to sideload an update
15:54:44 <nscnt[m]> You need a cable to sideload it
15:54:54 <hunter5> yeah I thought this is an update I still need to receive
15:55:12 <nscnt[m]> If you didn't disable the Seamless Update Client, you'll get updates over-the-air

16:22:44 <mrmccall[m]> Does Vanadium do anything to randomize your browser fingerprint?
16:23:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mrmccall[m]: no, Vanadium is not Brave
16:24:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> afaik Brave is the only popular browser that does "fingerprint randomisation"
16:25:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I don't think it is a "good" feature
16:25:09 <wiegolf[m]> I use Bromite browser
16:25:19 <mrmccall[m]> Thought so. I need to switch to Brave then. But I don't think it even randomizes it unless in strict mode,right?
16:25:37 <mrmccall[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> I don't think it is a "g"> Why
16:26:39 <southron[m]> Check out Bromite first. I've been really happy with it.
16:28:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mrmccall[m]: required reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
16:28:45 <hunter5> there is no way to install addons with these right?
16:29:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> with Bromite/Vanadium?
16:29:08 <hunter5> yeah
16:29:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you really really shouldn't
16:29:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> afaik it is possible, but requires a lot of things to do (not simple at all)
16:29:47 <hunter5> what if I have multiple phones and times where I dont care about fingerprinting and just want to get rid of all theses annoyances
16:30:13 <hunter5> I didnt realize how bad it's become always using ublock etc
16:31:17 <hunter5> ok I will check again then, couldn't really find anything on the matter
16:31:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hunter5: required reading https://grapheneos.org/faq
16:31:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Long story short, of you want to block adds, just use a dns
16:32:04 <hunter5> yeah been going through that
16:32:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Or Bromite
16:32:29 <hunter5> true but what about the cookies I dont care about, or other annoyances
16:32:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Private browsing🤷‍♂
16:33:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Tor browser?
16:33:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Actually, this is pretty off topic
16:33:47 <icebergfive> No dog in the fight but this is worth knowing about Brave: https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/brave-user-agent-detection.html
16:33:59 <icebergfive> I'm also using Bromite and pretty happy so far

17:49:19 <_linux> question for anyone using proton mail apk on graphene os
17:49:44 <_linux> downloaded files seem to get saved in the abyss.  anyone have this issue?
17:50:26 <_linux> i cant find the saved anywhere in the phone ive looked everywhere except for plugging the phone into my linux pc and going through the file system that way
17:53:44 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So I unfortunately can't walk yo"> Android Studio?
17:55:14 <jj1013[m]> > <@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org> So I unfortunately can't walk you through it. I know that a few people here have compiled and run GrapheneOS in an emulator using Android Studio, but again, I haven't done that myself.
17:55:14 <jj1013[m]>  * Android Studio? Is that safe to use?
17:58:11 <r0tt0r[m]> hi, i saw reddit post about 04 5 20 release but on website its not yet publoshed?
17:58:13 <jj1013[m]> <_linux "i cant find the saved anywhere i"> Maybe you should use a different file manager.
17:59:12 <_linux> any suggestions?  i currently have only the file manager that comes on graphene by default
18:00:02 <_linux> its like the proton mail application is saving the downloaded files somewhere i cant access using the default Files app
18:01:55 <hunter5> _linux: I just got it to work using termux
18:02:31 <_linux> you use termux to navigate folder structure?
18:02:41 <_linux> and then mv the file to an accessible location?
18:03:02 <hunter5> no I just selected open with termux and it will offer to save the file for you lol
18:03:26 <hunter5> strange that proton doesnt offer a safe function
18:04:00 <_linux> im trying to save a ca-cert file from the protonmail apk but it saves somewhere i cant access
18:04:06 <hunter5> but it landed in some tmp folder for sure when you just open with a reader
18:04:07 <_linux> i will try using termux
18:04:17 <_linux> yes it is odd
18:06:04 <_linux> youre a hero lol
18:06:07 <_linux> it worked
18:06:11 <_linux> thank you !
18:06:16 <hunter5> terminals always save your ass
18:06:22 <hunter5> no prob
18:06:25 <_linux> that they do my friend
18:09:15 <_linux> is 'ls' not a termux function? lol
18:11:45 <hunter5> in termux you have to use list
18:16:17 <_linux> it required a 2nd launch. it must have installed packages on first launch and needed to be restarted. now ls works
18:16:49 <jj1013[m]> So Termux does not need root? Nice.
18:16:55 <skwisgaar[m]> Please discuss this in OT

18:23:42 <_linux> jj1013[m]: no you can download the protonmail apk direct from their website
18:23:50 <_linux> since its not in Fdroid there was no other option
18:24:13 <_linux> and i prefer the client over opening protonmail in vanadium

20:28:06 <strcat[m]> probably already a way to do it, if it's useful
20:28:28 <hunter5> great answer thanks! on another matter, shouldn't revoking sensor access to an app prevent it from detecting device orientation?
20:28:45 <strcat[m]> no because the app isn't detecting that
20:28:57 <strcat[m]> the OS is telling it if it's in portrait or landscape mode
20:29:02 <strcat[m]> not based on sensors used by the app
20:29:09 <strcat[m]> otherwise how would locking it and force rotating it work?
20:29:28 <hunter5> ahhh I see, interesting
20:29:40 <hunter5> makes sense
20:33:58 <itsokiwantogohom> <itsokiwantogohom "Interesting, I did not know that"> Guess I am stuck with either on or off on the 4a. Too bad.
20:34:09 <nextrobn[m]> Does Graphene send any information to google?
20:35:12 <hunter5> the only thing I'm aware of is connecting to a google server for the captive portal check
20:35:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Le marchand de rêves> What's Grapheneos support duration for a device?
20:35:56 <nextrobn[m]> <hunter5 "the only thing I'm aware of is c"> But no information about your device? IMEI number etc
20:36:04 <strcat[m]> hunter5: inaccurate
20:36:12 <strcat[m]> nextrobn: their statement is inaccurate
20:36:19 <hunter5> enlighten us then
20:36:31 <strcat[m]> please see https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
20:36:36 <strcat[m]> hunter5: not my job to correct people
20:39:06 <hunter5> ahh so you already gave an alternative to that, thats cool
20:44:22 <b1101> had my first p3 randoom reboot. actually didn't want to reboot at first. kept rebooting every time it reached the google logo. kept holding power, but before it turned off it finally showed me the grapheneos logo, and booted. hopefully doesn't start happening. first time I was listening to a digital radio station through vlc over wifi, and had bluetooth headphones on for 1.5 hours. after the reboot it continued to work fine though for another 1.5-2
20:44:22 <b1101> hours
20:44:55 <strcat[m]> if it's rebooting before it reaches the OS that's a hardware failure
20:45:04 <b1101> :/
20:45:46 <b1101> possibly overheating. I know the p3 batteries had issues with that
20:46:29 <b1101> I've only wireless charged the device a couple of times, but when I did it got really hot. stopped doing it after that
20:48:54 <hunter5> b1101: good to know so I can avoid that
20:49:17 <hunter5> so when the 3s reach their end of life this year, what exactly is meant by "no longer receive full security updates"
20:49:43 <hunter5> is that by the GOS project or is this still referring to the firmware and driver updates?
20:49:58 <strcat[m]> firmware and driver updates
20:50:00 <strcat[m]> look at the Pixel 2
20:50:02 <strcat[m]> covered in FAQ
20:50:04 <strcat[m]> same thing applies
20:51:01 <hunter5> I did I just found the details on what the extended support release means a bit lacking, thanks for the info!
20:52:03 <hunter5> 3 years is not great to already abandon your phone but it does make sense from their standpoint I suppose
20:54:11 <strcat[m]> the SoC is what stops being supported
20:54:18 <strcat[m]> it will be moving to 4 years from 3 for newer devices soon
20:54:34 <southron[m]> Oh nice
20:54:43 <hunter5> SoC is equal to phone these days isn't it.
20:54:59 <hunter5> or really? well I hope 3 line owners will get lucky on this one
20:55:02 <entry1> Wow, that is amazing news.
20:55:40 <ar-jan> Using GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a, I've had a strange thing happen twice where I at some point during a phone call, the other party stopped hearing me, while I could still hear them. Anyone experienced this or heard of it?
20:57:01 <hunter5> I've had this happen a lot recently using a prepaid phone. I think this could be related to network overload due to the pandemic
20:57:18 <hunter5> more so than the rom you are using,
20:57:40 <southron[m]> I had that problem on my IPhone even
20:58:21 <ar-jan> Ah so network related it is.
20:59:01 <hunter5> that being said I personally would not want to rely on a custom rom to use cell services reliably, but that's just my personal opinion
20:59:20 <hunter5> just heard too much stories about stuff like emergency calls not working properly etc
21:01:03 <ar-jan> I'd trust GrapheneOS a lot more in this respect than say some random unofficial LineageOS build or something
21:01:25 <hunter5> true but it also happened with the official build!
21:01:55 <strcat[m]> hunter5: please don't spread misinformation and FUD
21:02:03 <strcat[m]> just stop
21:02:08 <hunter5> oh you mean los being unofficial in general? then it applies all the same
21:02:22 <strcat[m]> this is the GrapheneOS chat channel
21:02:33 <hunter5> I made a disclaimer about it being stories I heard and it's just my personal opinion
21:02:45 <hunter5> it was off topic though right
21:02:45 <strcat[m]> yeah and that disclaimer doesn't make it okay
21:02:54 <hunter5> understood
21:03:21 <akc3n[m]1> #grapheneos-offtopic please.
21:03:32 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is a production quality OS with stable releases that are tested on each device
21:03:39 <strcat[m]> and a public Beta testing system
21:03:52 <strcat[m]> it isn't some automatic nightly build of a development branch done by a build server
21:04:11 <strcat[m]> also, it's an OS, built from source, not some customized version of the stock OS
21:04:44 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense to refer to an OS as a ROM and it's not a 'custom' one and can happily ship as the stock OS on a device
21:04:56 <strcat[m]> it's a common misunderstanding of what this project is
21:05:36 <strcat[m]> it's a lot clearer to people if you refer to it as what it is instead of using confusing terms from places like XDA
21:06:03 <strcat[m]> and saying positive or negative things about other OSes here is just not on-topic
21:06:07 <strcat[m]> unless it's directly related to GrapheneOS
21:06:16 <hunter5> well thanks for making that clear I am still learning about this project
21:06:22 <strcat[m]> there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
21:06:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Michael (@N​sane85) has joined the Telegram Group!
21:06:31 <joeth[m]1> <strcat[m] "it doesn't make sense to refer t"> true, i never understood the reason why people call modified android OSs 'ROMs', they're not written to ROM they're written to MMC
21:06:44 <strcat[m]> there's no eMMC anymore
21:06:47 <strcat[m]> except on Pixel 3a
21:07:04 <strcat[m]> even Pixel 1 had proper SSDs
21:07:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​sane85> Anyone else having a problem flashing with the web installer to a pixel 5 5g?
21:08:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​sane85> It times out while flashing system
21:09:10 <joeth[m]1> <strcat[m] "even Pixel 1 had proper SSDs"> I never knew that, pretty cool. Unfortunately I run a 3a so it's eMMC for me :(
21:25:32 <waffel360[m]> Hi there, I have 2 questions, 1st would be I need to get a copy of an apps files in /data/data/..... but can't seem to with adb (don't need to write)
21:34:38 <Guest14541> @thejollyroger, this is jeremy from the other day
21:35:01 <Guest14541> Error: Array buffer allocation failed
21:35:19 <Guest14541> so here is what i did; i did a clean install of Windows 10
21:35:41 <Guest14541> a complete clean slate; same error with the Web installer
21:41:38 <Guest14541> flashing graphene via the webUI just doesnt seem to work for me
21:41:59 <Guest14541> i literally wiped my computer to try
21:42:37 <hunter5> sucks to hear, well there was another guy on here
21:42:39 <hunter5> <N​sane85> Anyone else having a problem flashing with the web installer to a pixel 5 5g?
21:42:48 <hunter5> from telegram
21:43:11 <Guest14541> i worked with @thejollyroger quite a bit yeterday
21:43:33 <Guest14541> i tried a clean install of windows and got the same error at the same time; Error: Array buffer allocation failed
21:44:05 <Guest14541> flashing back to public
21:44:51 <hunter5> it could have to do with a recent firmware update I guess
21:45:01 <Guest14541> firmware of what
21:45:10 <hunter5> the phone
21:45:17 <Guest14541> i did an update to stock device prior to running the webio
21:45:19 <hunter5> I don't think the os is at fault
21:45:25 <Guest14541> web installer...
21:45:42 <Guest14541> also updated computer so everything was current
21:45:53 <hunter5> as you should but you could try flashing with the stock firmware
21:46:13 <hunter5> oh wait you cant undo those updates I think
21:46:30 <hunter5> not sure
21:46:34 <Guest14541> flashing back to public now
21:46:43 <Guest14541> so i can un brick this test device
21:47:19 <hunter5> you could also try cli route for what it's worth
21:47:33 <Guest14541> well i tried that yesterday
21:47:43 <hunter5> I didn't even bother with the firmware update and it worked really well even on an unsupported os
21:47:54 <hunter5> I don't have the 5 though
21:47:55 <Guest14541> i kept getting errors saying that my SDK was out of date, despite just downloading fresh
21:48:21 <hunter5> that sounds like some config file mismatch or something
21:48:35 <Guest14541> yeahnot sure what to do there
21:48:48 <hunter5> you also have the 5G version?
21:48:49 <Guest14541> was hoping @thejollyroger would have some tips
21:48:54 <Guest14541> yes
21:49:28 <hunter5> Hmm well good luck to you guys then
21:49:47 <Guest14541> LOL dont think he is active today
21:50:13 <Guest14541> am willing to try CLI again; just need to make sure i can return to stock
21:50:24 <strcat[m]> Guest14541: sounds like you don't have enough memory for web installer
21:50:25 <Guest14541> android flash tool seems to be working for that
21:50:27 <Guest14541> so thats good
21:50:37 <Guest14541> whats the needed memory
21:50:58 <strcat[m]> how much do you have?
21:51:13 <Guest14541> 2GB
21:52:12 <hunter5> that's exactly how much I used with Qubes but I did the tmp dir change fix to be safe
21:52:32 <Guest14541> what is that?
21:52:48 <hunter5> its a bunch of vms running on xen
21:52:56 <hunter5> with usb proxies and such
21:52:59 <Guest14541> roger
21:53:48 <Guest14541> if i do CLI should i use factory or OTA?
21:54:18 <hunter5> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#obtaining-factory-images
21:54:34 <hunter5> ota is over the air updates
21:54:49 <Guest14541> right
21:55:21 <Guest14541> if using CLI do i have to download with CURL? or cant i just download and extract the ZIP from "Releases"
21:55:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Guest14541: welcome back! do you have another phone with usb Type-C?
21:55:51 <Guest14541> no
21:55:58 <Guest14541> tried a few cables too
21:56:11 <Guest14541> currently using ANKER+
21:56:19 <Guest14541> tried different ports
21:56:28 <Guest14541> tried different (approved) browsers
21:56:31 <Guest14541> tried CLI
21:56:36 <Guest14541> im baffled
21:56:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Could be your computer's fault...
21:57:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i see, i don't think that 2gb RAM is enough, but don't take my word on this one
21:57:17 <Guest14541> iphone otherwise; bought the Pixel 5 to test for full switch
21:57:27 <Guest14541> roger on 2GB
21:57:36 <Guest14541> not above buying other CPU for testing
21:57:38 <hunter5> 2gb is minimum as per the guide
21:57:45 <Guest14541> roger
21:57:58 <Guest14541> wonder if that takes into account overhead for the Core OS
21:59:14 <hunter5> you don't need to use curl, and I guess it does but I didn't write the guide
21:59:27 <Guest14541> roger
21:59:31 <hunter5> it's a good idea to use a system with more
21:59:49 <Guest14541> haha this is becoming an expensive test
21:59:50 <Guest14541> lol
22:00:16 <Guest14541> i need to find a 2n1 that plays well with Ubuntu
22:00:53 <hunter5> the thing is you can't account for how much ram your os uses
22:01:03 <Guest14541> for sure
22:01:22 <hunter5> so if you got a heavy distro and just 2gb then I bet that's where your problem is
22:01:38 <hunter5> I thought you were also using some vm or something at first haha
22:01:42 <Guest14541> just running win 10 latest so yeah thats probably the bottle neck
22:01:50 <Guest14541> no, just a cheap netbook
22:02:02 <hunter5> there is most likely your problem
22:02:20 <Guest14541> yeah; well let me do some purchasing and more testing haha
22:02:34 <hunter5> or just load debian into ram
22:02:38 <hunter5> jk its hard
22:03:00 <hunter5> but possible I found a guide even
22:03:02 <Guest14541> lol
22:03:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> as to making this problem "less expensive" just order a new laptop/macbook, flash GrapheneOS and return the laptop)
22:03:16 <Guest14541> yeah will do!
22:03:17 <Guest14541> lol
22:03:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> overall 0$ cost
22:03:28 <Guest14541> otherwise phone return too hah
22:03:31 <hunter5> use the store notebook real quick lol
22:03:31 <Guest14541> this was the test
22:03:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hunter5: haahahahh XD
22:03:44 <Guest14541> LOL now thats a thought
22:03:57 <Guest14541> actually thats a good thought; wonder if i can pull that off
22:03:59 <Guest14541> LOL
22:04:04 <Guest14541> its web installer after all
22:04:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that's some Cyberpunk wibes)
22:04:38 <hunter5> excuse me sir while I use this display model to flash some snowden grade paranoia system onto my phone loool
22:04:44 <Guest14541> just gotta keep the GEEK Squad off me
22:07:12 <Guest14541> alright, ill report back after further testing
22:08:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> we're waiting for you Guest14541)
22:08:45 <Guest14541> :)
22:13:32 <strcat[m]> please help with testing the Beta release
22:13:37 <strcat[m]> going to need to do a new release soon anyway
22:13:55 <strcat> missed an update for 4a (5G) and 5
22:14:07 <strcat> couple camera driver fixes
22:19:06 <jj1013[m]> Does GrapheneOS have a clock app?
22:19:31 <strcat> there's one included, why?
22:21:15 <jj1013[m]> That is useful for alarms, in case I set any.
22:26:04 <waffel360[m]> Hi there, I have 2 questions, 1st would be I need to get a copy of an apps files in /data/data/..... but can't seem to with adb (don't need to write)
22:26:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> jj1013[m]: yes, GrapheneOS comes with a clock app, which has the alarm functionality
22:26:44 <strcat> waffel360[m]: adb backup, or run-as if the app is a debug build
22:27:02 <strcat> or decrypt Seedvault backup (the built-in backup service) via the tool that's available for that
22:27:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> You could have pinged me ─ what you just pinged was my Matrix user.
22:27:13 <waffel360[m]> run-as: package not debuggable
22:28:06 <strcat> waffel360[m]: so use backup support
22:28:11 <strcat> assuming app doesn't disable backups
22:28:22 <strcat> you aren't being specific with what you want to do
22:28:26 <strcat> so, that's the most help that can be given
22:36:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> katinatez (@k​atinatez) has joined the Telegram Group!
22:38:46 <hunter5> I wonder whether flight mode prevents all celltower connections even for emergency calls, so it can be used to avoid giving over positional data
22:39:43 <hunter5> not sure if that's specific to the os or can be influenced from there
22:55:31 <dazinism> https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html
23:00:35 <strcat> hunter5: https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
23:00:39 <strcat> hunter5: it disables the radio
23:01:04 <strcat> making an emergency call is explicitly choosing to disable airplane mode via the UI
23:01:15 <strcat> you obviously can't make an emergency call with the cellular radio disabled
23:02:10 <hunter5> ok I really need to read that doc word for word
23:03:16 <hunter5> I see, so that is how those calls just work even when you are in airplane mode
23:03:30 <hunter5> good to know
23:08:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <dazinism "https://security.googleblog.com/"> Cool
23:10:13 <cipherpunk2077[m> hey
23:10:38 <cipherpunk2077[m> i'm trying flash my pixel 5 in mac os big sur but this not is being detected by the automatic web installation
23:10:58 <cipherpunk2077[m> is needed enable any feature extra on my computer or phone to be detected?
23:11:09 <cipherpunk2077[m> i tried enabling the usb mode debug but the result is the same
23:23:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <k​atinatez> Hello, just installed GrapheneOS and noticed high battery drain, I read it was a bug to Signal app. So I unstalled signal to see if that helps. Any other settings to change for better battery?
23:25:19 <strcat[m]> it has great battery life
23:25:33 <strcat[m]> if you don't have great battery life you changed something or installed something that's draining it
23:25:58 <strcat[m]> Signal doesn't have a "bug" draining battery life, but rather their push implementation isn't quite as efficient as it could be
23:26:17 <strcat[m]> if you don't want Signal preventing deep idle states then simply don't give it the battery optimization exception it requests
23:26:23 <strcat[m]> it will still work... it will just have delayed notifications when the device is in deep idle
23:27:16 <strcat[m]> so, if you simply don't give it the battery optimization exception, you still have fully working Signal, you just don't get immediate notifications when device is totally idle
23:27:24 <strcat[m]> will still get them, just delayed
23:28:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <k​atinatez> thanks will reinstall and check permissions
23:40:37 <ryan[m]2> Once I had pdf viewer taking massive amounts of battery, even after a reboot. I had to disable it
23:48:44 <hitchhooker[m]> <strcat[m] "so, if you simply don't give it "> do you still receive calls through signal or are they dependent on push notifications as well?
23:49:42 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: question is wrong :P
23:49:51 <strcat[m]> I think I should add an FAQ entry on this
23:50:17 <strcat[m]> let me write an faq section and I'll link it
23:50:23 <hitchhooker[m]> cheers
23:52:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> cipherpunk2077[m: hi, do you still need installation assistance?
23:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hi cipherpunk2077[m, when you are trying to flash, is your phone in Bootloader?
23:53:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeeei, hello Peter P.-)
23:54:17 <TheJollyRoger> If your phone's not in bootloader mode, even if your phone is plugged in and your hardware and cabling is good, the web installer can't talk to the bootloader, because the bootloader's not in control of the phone, the operating system is! You'll need to make sure that that's set first, if you haven't, the easiest way is to switch the phone off, then press and hold down the Volume Down key and
23:54:18 <TheJollyRoger> then press and hold the Power button and keep those held down until you see a black screen with some white text and some red text.
23:54:23 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy @Hulk!
23:54:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Imma head out now, have a good one)
23:54:45 <cipherpunk2077[m> i fixed it already with a bit of help from strcat, thanks anyways :)
23:54:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, fare thee well @Hulk!
23:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> cipherpunk2077[m: arr, glad to hear! Welcome aboard the ship!
