00:03:09 <rny> Kribbles: boot back into recovery mode and reflash
00:04:51 <Kribbles> Well, I was stupid. I was pushing the wrong buttons to boot back into recovery mode, thanks.
00:11:49 <squarmkt[m]> <whhoops[m] "Am at the waiting for any device"> Sounds like a driver issue, you need the official drivers frombgooglenfor it to work with fastboot, I'm pretty sure. They should come with android sdk
00:12:26 <whhoops[m]> Installing Android studio
00:12:32 <squarmkt[m]> Also, are you in fastboot on the phone? It will say waiting for device if you arent
00:12:57 <whhoops[m]> Yup
00:15:07 <squarmkt[m]> Okay then seem like driver issue
00:15:15 <squarmkt[m]> * Okay then seems like driver issue
00:15:22 <squarmkt[m]> * Okay then seems like a driver issue
00:17:17 <whhoops[m]> It's still stick after getting android studio
00:17:22 <whhoops[m]> Stuck*
00:17:28 <whhoops[m]> Restart computer?
00:17:56 <TheJollyRoger> whhoops[m]: can't stay for long but there should be a page about managing the USB drivers within Android Studio. This isn't enabled by default, hang on a sec.
00:18:50 <TheJollyRoger> https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb This might give you some idea of where to go to enable the driver within the Android Software Development Kit.
00:21:56 <whhoops[m]> Ok did that restarting computer
00:25:14 <Kribbles> Cheers, successfully installed, thanks, have a good night.
00:25:41 <whhoops[m]> Didn't work
00:25:56 <squarmkt[m]> Thank you TheJollyRoger
00:26:06 <whhoops[m]> Went to device manager to pull the driver from it and wouldn't install
00:26:07 <squarmkt[m]> Still says waiting for device?
00:26:18 <whhoops[m]> Yes
00:27:04 <squarmkt[m]> Pull driver from? Android studio? Also, is everything up to date?
00:28:15 <whhoops[m]> Yes
00:29:24 <squarmkt[m]> What if you do "fastboot devices" in powershell?
00:29:55 <squarmkt[m]> And fastboot --version while were at it
00:30:18 <whhoops[m]> Returns nothing
00:31:26 <squarmkt[m]> Even "fastboot --version"
00:31:36 <squarmkt[m]> * Even "fastboot --version"?
00:31:55 <whhoops[m]> Unknown option --e
00:33:09 <squarmkt[m]> Spelled version correctly? Could you have missed the v? That seems really weird if that's what its returning
00:33:50 <rny> what exactly are you trying to do?
00:34:30 <squarmkt[m]> Install graphene, but he's stuck at unlock BC his device isn't being recognized, I'm trying to see what's working and what's not
00:34:47 <whhoops[m]> Oh whoops
00:36:02 <whhoops[m]> Returns as
00:36:02 <whhoops[m]> Fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
00:36:02 <whhoops[m]> Installed as folder loaction
00:36:26 <squarmkt[m]> Okay that's the right version
00:38:32 <squarmkt[m]> I don't know of a way to check for the drivers, but does the phone come up as mtp or the device model in file explorer
00:38:36 <BallistolEnjoyer> Is apples IOMMU more secure than Pixel/AOSP?
00:39:11 <whhoops[m]> While in bootloader it doesn't show up
00:39:35 <squarmkt[m]> What about when not in bootloader?
00:39:52 <squarmkt[m]> BallistolEnjoyer better topic for off topic
00:39:55 <whhoops[m]> In os it says pixel 4a
00:40:46 <whhoops[m]> But it has been performing normally prior to android sdk operation
00:40:59 <whhoops[m]> Installation
00:41:06 <squarmkt[m]>  Interesting, and you're sure the drivers installed successfully? Can just try fastboot devices again to check as well
00:41:26 <squarmkt[m]> What has been performing normally prior?
00:41:57 <whhoops[m]> Showing up as pixel 4a in explorer
00:43:03 <whhoops[m]> Still returning nothing
00:43:48 <squarmkt[m]> Gotcha, would you be willing to try the webusb installer? I can't think of anything else to try to help you.
00:44:46 <whhoops[m]> Is there a catch in using it
00:44:52 <whhoops[m]> .....
00:45:10 <squarmkt[m]> Its highly experimental, could not work, but you're at that point right now
00:45:23 <whhoops[m]> Sure let's go for it
00:45:39 <squarmkt[m]> https://grapheneos.org/web-install
00:45:41 <whhoops[m]> I will be guinea pig on this mint 3 hour use pixel 4a
00:45:54 <squarmkt[m]> Wonderful
00:46:59 <squarmkt[m]> I'll stay on while you go through it
00:48:22 <whhoops[m]> I'm confused
00:48:37 <whhoops[m]> I'm looking at the documentation and it's pretty bare
00:49:41 <squarmkt[m]> Yes its new, you should mostly be pressing buttons
00:52:07 <whhoops[m]> When I swear I'm not retarded just that my I have no script running and I thought the buttons didn't do anything
00:54:26 <squarmkt[m]> Lol,that might cause problems I think you need to be in chrome if you aren't already
00:54:38 <squarmkt[m]> * Lol,that might cause problems I you need to be in chrome if you aren't already
00:54:50 <squarmkt[m]> * Lol,that might cause problems I you need to be in chrome/chromium if you aren't already
00:56:57 <whhoops[m]> So browser says that no compatible devices found using another chrome profile
00:57:27 <squarmkt[m]> Another chrome profile?
00:57:32 <whhoops[m]> Yes
00:57:57 <whhoops[m]> So that extensions no extensions are enabled or there
00:59:49 <squarmkt[m]> Got it, don't know what's going on
01:00:09 <whhoops[m]> Browser detect nothing it's a ghost phone
01:01:10 <strcat[m]> whhoops: make sure you're using a proper cable
01:01:13 <strcat[m]> which OS are you on
01:01:20 <strcat[m]> don't use web-install yet
01:01:31 <strcat[m]> use the regular install process, we're still working on web-install
01:01:41 <whhoops[m]> Windows 10 anker usb cable
01:01:55 <strcat[m]> whhoops: check windows update optional updates
01:01:57 <strcat[m]> for driver updates
01:01:58 <squarmkt[m]> strcat my bad
01:02:13 <whhoops[m]> Already did windows optional updates
01:02:52 <strcat[m]> check for fastboot driver there
01:03:13 <strcat[m]> it's probably either a USB port issue or for some reason Windows didn't autoinstall the right driver as it usually does
01:03:44 <murefu> is it possible to install graphene on an original pixel phone?
01:04:23 <whhoops[m]> Lemobile android bootloader interface
01:04:24 <whhoops[m]> Lemobile android composite adb interface
01:04:24 <whhoops[m]> Get both
01:04:47 <strcat[m]> murefu: no they haven't been supported for ages
01:05:03 <murefu> ok thank. :-(
01:05:03 <strcat[m]> murefu: and Pixel 2 is only supported via extended support releases, those are end-of-life and insecure too
01:06:38 <whhoops[m]> OH MY GÓOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDD
01:06:45 <whhoops[m]> It done did it
01:07:02 <whhoops[m]> Lemobile in optional updates
01:07:23 <strcat[m]> yes it autodetects fastboot / adb and if you have automatic install of updates enabled it should just get them for you
01:07:28 <strcat[m]> which afaik, is the normal default
01:07:54 <strcat[m]> it doesn't properly realize that it's not a specific brand of device but rather a generic API
01:07:58 <strcat[m]> so it gives it some arbitrary name
01:08:02 <strcat[m]> arbitrary brand name
01:08:04 <whhoops[m]> I did have autodetect but it didn't auto install for some reasio
01:14:02 <whhoops[m]> Ok loading in
01:15:10 <whhoops[m]> Thank you Graphene Community for helping me
01:16:11 <whhoops[m]> I would like to especially thank strcat the jolly roger and squarmcat
01:17:24 <strcat> just make sure to lock after it finishes flashing
01:17:35 <noobexterminator> Yo dudesss
01:17:36 <strcat> and as long as it shows the notice that it's loading an alternate OS
01:17:43 <strcat> that means it worked properly and is being fully verified
01:17:58 <noobexterminator> Just bought my first pixel phone 1 hour ago
01:18:00 <noobexterminator> Yehzzzirrr
01:19:20 <rny> what are these optional drivers that are required on win10?
01:19:50 <strcat> rny: just the usual fastboot / adb drivers
01:20:02 <strcat> for some people, for some reason the drivers aren't auto-installed as normal
01:20:15 <strcat> and it detects it as some arbitrary brand of Android device
01:20:21 <strcat> I think it's the same driver for all of them though
01:20:37 <rny> odd
01:21:07 <rny> so microsoft windows decides that they should give android users a hard time while apple users get a seamless experience?
01:22:00 <whhoops[m]> Is anyone willing to remote audit my device
01:22:44 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: 20210123_191904-01.jpeg (296KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/lIeUeHNjkEwXWCmroPjUmAVJ/20210123_191904-01.jpeg >
01:22:51 <strcat[m]> whhoops: you can use the https://attestation.app service
01:24:54 <strcat[m]> rny: I think it's more that some people have messed up Windows installs
01:24:55 <strcat[m]> rny: most people don't seem to have the issue
01:24:56 <strcat[m]> rny: also it's only an issue for adb/fastboot
01:24:56 <strcat[m]> not mtp
01:29:24 <hashenstein[m]> Hi, I'm trying to follow the installation instructions and I'm stuck at the unlocking the bootloader step... where I'm supposed to confirm on the device. I'm in Fastboot mode on the device, but don't see a way to confirm.
01:30:19 <lodtank> the volume +/- buttons on your phone change what you want to do
01:32:28 <hashenstein[m]> My options are: Restart Bootloader, Start, Power off, BarCode, Rescue Mode, and Recovery Mode
01:33:30 <hashenstein[m]> Am I supposed to run the "fastboot flashing unlock" and THEN plug in the phone, because I already had the phone plugged in.
01:33:41 <hashenstein[m]>  * Am I supposed to run the "fastboot flashing unlock" and THEN plug in the phone? because I already had the phone plugged in.
01:36:31 <vdge[m]> I have a question, FAQ recommends DNS based adblocking with Adguard. Wouldn't using Adguard DNS along with my VPN just make me more unique? In that case, is there a better solution for systemwide ad blocking when the VPN is turned on ?
01:37:38 <tidria[m]> <hashenstein[m] "Am I supposed to run the "fastbo"> fastboot flashing unlock is done after the device is connected and in fastboot mode
01:37:59 <tidria[m]> you will be presented different options with the volume buttons at that time
01:38:09 <strcat[m]> vdge: it doesn't recommend Adguard specifically
01:38:13 <strcat[m]> it uses it as an example
01:38:27 <strcat[m]> vdge: ad-blocking will make you more unique, regardless of how you do it
01:38:36 <strcat[m]> vdge: DNS-based ad-blocking is the cleanest approach to system-wide ad-blocking
01:38:43 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "it uses it as an *example*"> Yeah yeah, I get it. I was just referring it as a good example.
01:38:47 <strcat[m]> vdge: and yes, as with *any other approach* to blocking ads, it makes you more unique
01:39:06 <strcat[m]> vdge: sites, etc. can determine that you are blocking content and enumerate which content you're blocking
01:39:24 <strcat[m]> vdge: they can also detect which DNS servers you're using, but in this case, those 2 are the same piece of info
01:39:47 <hashenstein[m]> vdge: Okay, I've powered up the device into Fastboot Mode. Then I issued the command in the terminal. The last line of text on the screen says, "Enter reason: combo key"
01:39:50 <strcat[m]> vdge: if you want to avoid standing out, use the default DNS servers, use your VPN provided DNS servers if you're using a VPN
01:40:13 <strcat[m]> consider using a VPN that has a DNS-based ad-blocking toggle built-in so you blend in with all the other users of the VPN enabling it
01:40:18 <strcat[m]> PIA has that, as one of many examples
01:40:54 <strcat[m]> hashenstein: phone needs to be plugged into the computer with a working cable then run the command to unlock
01:41:06 <puerh> Is there a good option to throw on a hypervisor? Pihole?
01:41:09 <strcat[m]> make sure to read the info it has on USB, etc.
01:41:25 <strcat[m]> puerh: unsure what you mean
01:41:29 <hashenstein[m]> I'm using the cable that came with the phone. It's plugged into my thinkpad. The terminal says, "< wating for device >"
01:41:36 <strcat[m]> hosting your own DNS server / VPN makes you stand out as completely unique
01:42:07 <tidria[m]> <hashenstein[m] "I'm using the cable that came wi"> if you do "fastboot devices" it doesnt return info about your device?
01:42:22 <strcat[m]> hashenstein: which OS are you using?
01:43:05 <hashenstein[m]> Windows 10 Pro
01:43:40 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "consider using a VPN that has a "> Aha, I use nord and it has so called cybersec. I might use that but I have one more need.
01:44:04 <strcat[m]> vdge: you said you don't want to stand out from others
01:44:13 <strcat[m]> that conflicts with wanting to filter traffic in a way that's unique to you
01:44:56 <strcat[m]> you have to choose: filter traffic with something like NextDNS, a local DNS server, etc.
01:44:58 <strcat[m]> or blend in with others
01:45:09 <strcat[m]> sites can enumerate everything you're blocking
01:45:29 <strcat[m]> and Spotify can still talk to facebook without being able to connect to facebook domains via the app
01:45:37 <strcat[m]> they can just talk to it via their app server and I'm sure they do already
01:45:41 <strcat[m]> you're not in control of that
01:45:56 <strcat[m]> if you allow Spotify to talk to the Spotify server, which is required for it to work, you allow it to talk to Facebook
01:46:01 <strcat[m]> I recommend not engaging in privacy theater
01:46:08 <strcat[m]> you will make yourself able to be tracked more easily
01:46:27 <hashenstein[m]> I wonder if I have a bad cable... it came right out of a sealed box, though.
01:46:27 <strcat[m]> and you will not in any way stop Spotify or other apps from sharing data with Facebook or others
01:46:36 <hashenstein[m]> The Windows sees the phone.
01:46:46 <strcat[m]> they can and do share data via their servers
01:47:04 <strcat[m]> don't give the Spotify app data you don't want them to have and share with their partners
01:47:07 <tidria[m]> <hashenstein[m] "I wonder if I have a bad cable.."> possible given your reports, is the USB driver up to date? Maybe it didnt automatically register
01:47:35 <hashenstein[m]> I made sure that both the pixel and windows were up-to-date before beginning.
01:47:40 <hashenstein[m]> I'll try another cable
01:47:42 <strcat[m]> if you don't want Spotify and whoever they share data with to know your music preferences, use a different app, having a local music collection would be best for privacy
01:47:59 <strcat[m]> hashenstein: check optional updates
01:48:24 <tidria[m]> <strcat[m] "don't give the Spotify app data "> if his use case is as simple as not wanting his homies to know he listened to Nickelback for 4 hours straight perhaps not hooking in with his Facebook account is the real solution?
01:49:21 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "I recommend not engaging in priv"> That totally makes sense. Thanks a lot for putting together my scrambled thoughts. Back of the mind, I did knew I was making myself more unique but my hate towards Facebook was taking hold of me. haha
01:50:03 <vdge[m]> <tidria[m] "if his use case is as simple as "> Why would i hook FB account even in my dreams to something like Spotify. :kill_me:
01:50:15 <strcat[m]> tidria: not connecting it to facebook doesn't mean they won't share data with facebook though
01:50:29 <strcat[m]> the issue is making the mistake of thinking you can stop it in the client
01:50:39 <strcat[m]> and then ending up making yourself more easily tracked by sites, etc.
01:50:44 <strcat[m]> from using custom DNS and filtering stuff
01:50:55 <strcat[m]> it's best to use a common VPN with the standard VPN DNS or a similar setup
01:51:12 <strcat[m]> if you use a VPN but custom DNS server, then you stand out from anyone else using that VPN who doesn't use that same custom DNS server
01:51:19 <strcat[m]> content filtering is the same
01:51:24 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "tidria: not connecting it to fac"> Yeah totally. I get what you are trying to say about first party data sharing :)
01:51:37 <strcat[m]> if 50% of the VPN users a VPN-provided content filtering toggle, then using that doesn't make you stand out
01:51:48 <strcat[m]> if 2% of the VPN users use Adguard DNS
01:51:55 <strcat[m]> well, now you only fit in with 2% of the users of the VPN
01:51:56 <strcat[m]> if you use that
01:52:20 <strcat[m]> hope that makes sense
01:52:56 <vdge[m]> What if the VPN provider doesn't offer any type of content filtering. Should I just give up and use it as is ? (Asking for another homie)
01:53:10 <strcat[m]> vdge: yes, or if it's something you want, use one that provides it
01:53:14 <strcat[m]> that's my recommendation
01:54:34 <vdge[m]> Gotcha! I will stick with the lord cybersec
01:54:51 <hashenstein[m]> Hmm. Okay, I've verified that I have the latest Windows updates installed. I've got a new cable and I'm using a different port. Same issue. Maybe I'm not understanding the instructions. What should I be seeing?
01:57:02 <tidria[m]> <TheJollyRoger "https://developer.android.com/st"> check that you have the correct USB drivers
01:57:36 <tidria[m]> your phone isn't being recognized and it could be a matter of interfacing correctly, follow the instructions outlined here
01:57:46 <hashenstein[m]> Am I supposed to install all the Android developer stuff before doing this?
01:58:04 <tidria[m]> there is an option to do just the google usb drivers
01:58:28 <hashenstein[m]> I was trying to follow the instruction here https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
02:00:04 <tidria[m]> <hashenstein[m] "I was trying to follow the instr"> @strcat:matrix.org: could answer this better but having read the instructions the assumption is you have the USB drivers installed
02:00:15 <tidria[m]> it is, after all, supposed to be automatic
02:01:03 <hashenstein[m]> Hmm. Okay.
02:02:28 <strcat[m]> Windows obtains the drivers
02:02:35 <strcat[m]> you don't need to install anything from a third party
02:02:40 <strcat[m]> you get them from Windows Update
02:02:43 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to be automatic
02:02:44 <hashenstein[m]> I was planning on installing Android Studio anyway. I'll just do that, and then double check that the Google USB driver is installed as well, and then try again.
02:02:55 <strcat[m]> you can manually go into Windows Update and check optional updates
02:03:00 <strcat[m]> or you can install the driver from Google
02:03:04 <strcat[m]> pretty sure it's  the same driver
02:03:11 <hashenstein[m]> Yeah, I have all of the updates from MSFT.
02:03:12 <strcat[m]> from Google may be newer though
02:03:17 <strcat[m]> hashenstein: it would be an optional update
02:03:18 <hashenstein[m]> including all optional.
02:03:23 <strcat[m]> hashenstein: check
02:03:29 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't show up until the device is plugged in
02:03:34 <strcat[m]> normally it would just go and download it by itself
02:03:36 <strcat[m]> though
02:04:02 <hashenstein[m]> Hmm. Okay, I'll try running windows update and look under optional while the device is plugged in.
02:04:45 <hashenstein[m]> Windows is so tedius sometimes. I'll try rebooting as well in case the driver is hung or something.
02:08:51 <hashenstein[m]> Aha. I did install something. "LeMobile - Other Hardware - Android Bootloader Interface"
02:09:51 <tidria[m]> Ya it showed up as LeMobile for the other guy earlier
02:10:07 <tidria[m]> Last time I installed the driver showed Samsung
02:10:31 <tidria[m]> I think someone gave an explanation why it shows a random company sometimes
02:11:50 <hashenstein[m]> Yay! Works.
02:12:39 <hashenstein[m]> Thanks for the help! I'll continue on...

03:37:55 <ch3ster> hello, I've setup pixel and just installed gos, I am at https://grapheneos.org/install#verifying-installation with Auditor. As I do not have another android device on hand, As I read the tutorial on attestation.app step 1 says to create an account from a seperate device.. so since i do not have a sepearete device, am I able to just using my laptop?
03:38:19 <zuckedone> hi, i just want to report an issue i fought with while trying to install graphene os to my pixel 4, while following the standard install instructions to the letter i got an error in fastboot in the flash-all.sh script at the line with "fastboot -w --skip-reboot update image.zip" stating the error "Setting current slot to 'a' FAILED (remote:
03:38:20 <zuckedone> 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.') fastboot: error: Command failed", i had to run "fastboot snapshot-update cancel" and rerun the command and all was good.
03:38:53 <zuckedone> if anyone with any control over the install page could add this tid bit i think it would help future graphene os installers
03:39:32 <ch3ster> Also, the next question I have before I proceed with that. in the faq section, https://grapheneos.org/faq#security-and-privacy the recommendation for high security setup, use the owner profile for managing other profiles. So should I use the owner profile to do the auditor app, or create a secondary profile that I will use on a regular basis and do the auditing from that?
03:52:25 <Albakham[m]> ch3ster wait a bit, answers will come
03:52:50 <ch3ster> okay will do, thanks.
04:02:30 <take_a_deep_brea> zuckedone: i dont think there is any issue with flash-all.sh as people regularly use that script and the installation is just fine for them
04:02:30 <take_a_deep_brea> i think there is some issue with your setup .
04:02:30 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe the usb cable you are using is not of good quality, or maybe your usb port on your la
04:02:56 <take_a_deep_brea> * zuckedone: i dont think there is any issue with flash-all.sh as people regularly use that script and the installation is just fine for them

04:03:52 <Albakham[m]> Most errors is bad hardware
04:04:14 <take_a_deep_brea> zuckedone:  even if the problem was with the script that would be a fastboot bug.not something that we fix here.
04:04:42 <take_a_deep_brea> and i dont think its a fastboot bug . the problem you reported has been seen before
04:28:45 <squarmkt[m]> <ch3ster "Also, the next question I have b"> Would use owner for auditor app esp if you are connected to the attestation server so the profile doesn't go dormant and then the server doesn't see it. I saw somewhere where only 3 profiles can be active at a time, so if you have more than that it can be a concern. Someone correct me if I'm wrong
04:30:06 <take_a_deep_brea> squarmkt: they have been answered in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:30:26 <ch3ster> active at the same time? I thought only the owner one is, while the secondary or even the 3rd profile, end session only end session and not switch?
04:32:49 <take_a_deep_brea> ch3ster: multiple profiles can be active at the same time . but the network is shared . so is the Andorid VPN service
04:33:19 <squarmkt[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "squarmkt: they have been answere"> Yeah, I was off for a while and saw this chat first
04:33:36 <take_a_deep_brea> no issues .just saving you some time .
04:33:52 <squarmkt[m]> Thank you
04:34:11 <ch3ster> take_a_deep_brea, now i complete understand. when you mention 'the network is shared'.
04:46:36 <noobexterminator> guys
04:46:55 <noobexterminator> Did yall use SDK platform tools or Minimal ADB?
04:49:03 <noobexterminator> Im confused on which one to use
04:49:10 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: the official SDK platform
04:49:41 <noobexterminator> Should i use that
04:49:42 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
04:49:52 <take_a_deep_brea> please go through that .
04:50:14 <take_a_deep_brea> and follow according to your OS setup
04:50:17 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: Minimal ADB will lead to a corrupted/softbricked device.
04:50:27 <noobexterminator> DAMN
04:50:41 <noobexterminator> Your a life saver for saying that
04:50:57 <TheJollyRoger> use it if you want to find out what an unbootable phone looks like (spoiler: it just turns off and then back on again)
04:51:15 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: could you tell me where you were told to use minimal adb
04:51:29 <noobexterminator> <take_a_deep_brea "noobexterminator3000: could you "> Techlore
04:51:53 <take_a_deep_brea> i see . only follow first party instructions for any product
04:53:18 <noobexterminator> Is there like yt video i can follow
04:53:29 <take_a_deep_brea> the techlore video does have comments below that ask you to refer to official guide first , lmao
04:53:55 <take_a_deep_brea> <noobexterminator "Is there like yt video i can fol"> none that i know of .
04:54:10 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: https://asciinema.org/a/qVCcAFPUMheCIPejb6EwjXow4 Better. Here's what installation looks like on a 4a.
04:54:21 <take_a_deep_brea> good
04:54:23 <TheJollyRoger> This is the exact workflow.
04:55:08 <noobexterminator> What if i fail
04:55:46 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: If you mess up, then you can use the web flash tool at flash.android.com  to restore your phone to a factory fresh state.
04:56:07 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: at most your device wont have an operating system image to boot from , you can always recover to stock and start again
04:56:20 <TheJollyRoger> Unless, of course, you try to do something like flash a 4a image on a 4a5G, in which case, the money is burned.
04:56:30 <noobexterminator> Its on 3a
04:57:32 <TheJollyRoger> I can't be available for a talk-down tonight, unfortunately, but if you're having trouble I think I might be available later next week.
04:57:53 <noobexterminator> Yessir
04:58:06 <noobexterminator> Thanks dude
04:59:32 <TheJollyRoger> For the 3a you'll need to check your device's codename, it's on the releases page.
05:00:31 <TheJollyRoger> Once you start the flashing process via the installation script, wait for it to either complete and exit (on Linux) or say "Finished, press any key to exit) before proceeding onto the next step.
05:01:35 <TheJollyRoger> Everything's handled via the flash-all script. The majority of problems people tend to have is with setting up their own host and in this channel, generally most of the problems people have are due to following third party guides or installing third-party software.
05:02:09 <TheJollyRoger> Second to that tends to be issues like problems like their computers not properly and fully implementing USB to the standard, or substandard USB cables which aren't fully traced.
05:02:51 <TheJollyRoger> Gotta run for now, good luck, and welcome aboard the ship in advance!
05:03:08 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: if you have a usb-c port then it is best to use that along with the usb-c to usb-c cable that came with the device
05:20:09 <noobexterminator> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxzXPaHvVkw&t=602
05:25:53 <take_a_deep_brea> what about that noobexterminator3000:  ?
05:26:17 <noobexterminator> Its probably the best tutorial out there i guess
05:27:32 <noobexterminator> <take_a_deep_brea "what about that noobexterminator"> How long did it take you to install grapheneOs
05:27:44 <noobexterminator> Like the whole proccess
05:28:31 <take_a_deep_brea> about 15 minutes if you dont take download time into account
05:28:51 <take_a_deep_brea> 25 if you add that
05:29:00 <noobexterminator> Did you use Cmd or Powershell
05:29:26 <take_a_deep_brea> that video mixes up actions done on the terminal and some file manipulation done with file manager
05:29:31 <take_a_deep_brea> that is unnecesary
05:29:37 <take_a_deep_brea> and do not use cmd
05:29:42 <take_a_deep_brea> use powershell
05:29:53 <take_a_deep_brea> cmd is a legacy terminal
05:30:48 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000:  i have an urgent work now so need to go . sorry to leave you like this in the middle  . but then you can wait if you want i should be back in an hour .
05:31:07 <take_a_deep_brea> it is very easy to just follow the official guide
05:31:40 <take_a_deep_brea> as long as your hardware setup does not interrupt the install because of bad usb cble or broken usb port
05:31:50 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: if you have a usb-c port then it is best to use that along with the usb-c to usb-c cable that came with the device
05:31:51 <noobexterminator> Before you go
05:31:54 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.01.23.03 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.23.03
05:31:58 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1353212859455590402
05:32:02 <noobexterminator> Can i just use Cmd and not powershell
05:32:07 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/l3tczt/grapheneos_2021012303_release/
05:32:11 <strcat[m]> noobexterminator3000: no
05:32:16 <noobexterminator> Ok
05:32:25 <noobexterminator> But it worked for him tho
05:32:36 <take_a_deep_brea> <strcat[m] "GrapheneOS 2021.01.23.03 release"> nice
05:35:03 <take_a_deep_brea> <noobexterminator "But it worked for him tho"> does not matter . his OS setup is a question mark for us . powershell has been widely tested . its upto you if you follow his instructions . but if later on if you have issues it will be more difficult for you to figure out and in case you come here it will be difficult for us too .
05:35:42 <take_a_deep_brea> if you face problems with official instructions then at the very least we can backtrace the problem together in case you choose to communicate the problem here
05:36:44 <noobexterminator> Ok take_a_deep_breath i will use the Official Guide
05:36:57 <noobexterminator> No youtube only official guide
05:37:07 <take_a_deep_brea> great!
05:37:08 <noobexterminator> I will follow the instructions
07:03:21 <mrk[m]> I'm looking to pentest grapheneOS, possibly fuzz common components. Are there any code entry points anyone might suggest I start to take a look at?
07:54:02 <ch3ster_> I was chatting earlier on here about multiple profiles and using only having the owner one just for auditor, vpn, and managing secondary (personal) profile and third (work) profile, I just go around to purchasing a vpn, doing the auditor for remote verification. and now i created my secondary profile, and its automatically connected to wifi (like take_a_deep_brea mentioned earlier). but there is no vpn on it, and when i do a check online, it
07:54:02 <ch3ster_> shows my home ip. did i miss understand then? I thought it was supposed to be active from the owner profile, and shared to second profile where i can see it in settings- network, vpn..
07:56:28 <deappledapple> Yeah because you disconnected it, and if you haven't toggled these (Always-on VPN, Block connections without VPN), it will leak when disconnected
07:57:36 <deappledapple> Network > VPN > Gear icon > toggle those two
07:57:56 <deappledapple> It already leaked to apps etc unfortunately
07:58:10 <take_a_deep_brea> ch3ster_: what i meant was if the VPN is on in an owner profile or the VPN is on in a user profile which is still working in background (that i syou didnt end the session ), then the VPN app in the current profile cannot use the Android VPN
07:58:29 <take_a_deep_brea>  * ch3ster_: what i meant was if the VPN is on in an owner profile or the VPN is on in a user profile which is still working in background (that is , if you didnt end the session ), then the VPN app in the current profile cannot use the Android VPN
07:59:21 <ch3ster_> deappledapple, disconnected it? What do you mean? I had everything working on the owner profile, vpn app setup and running, then in gos system -network settings, I enabled always on vpn and enabld block connection without vpn. then proceeded to create a secondary profile. when logging into it, it just connected to wifi. but im confused about what you mean that i disconnect it?
08:01:12 <datacloud[m]> Hi, is there a way to setup another search engine than default in vanadium browser?
08:02:34 <ch3ster_> take_a_deep_brea, i havent installed anything yet on the secondary profile. only in the owner profile where i installed vpn app, then set android network settings vpn section to always on and block wihtout internet. what should i do now in the secondary profile to have vpn on it? do i need to adb install vpnapp.apk now to secondary profile?
08:02:43 <nscnt[m]> data.cloud: Vanadium's Settings > Search engine ?
08:02:50 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
08:03:24 <datacloud[m]> <nscnt[m] "data.cloud: Vanadium's Settings "> But in this settings, I cannot add another one
08:03:36 <take_a_deep_brea> ch3ster_: if you want vpn in a secondary profile you can do so by installing vpn app there too
08:03:40 <deappledapple> <ch3ster_ "Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?, disco"> Oh, thought you haven't toggled that. Did your owner and secondary user profile both have VPN?
08:03:52 <deappledapple> <ch3ster_ "take_a_deep_breath, i havent ins"> Oh nvm I see why it leaked
08:04:08 <take_a_deep_brea>  * yep ( to /nscnt)
08:04:16 <take_a_deep_brea>  * yep ( to nscnt)
08:04:22 <nscnt[m]> data.cloud: If you visit a search engine that is configured correctly, it will show up there as well.
08:04:46 <take_a_deep_brea>  * ch3ster_: if you want vpn in a secondary profile you can do so by installing vpn app there
08:05:08 <ch3ster_> ohh, so like if say i get all the info from vpn service, and not use the app, and input that info into the android network vpn settings part, then it will be on all the profiles?
08:05:47 <take_a_deep_brea> no
08:06:01 <take_a_deep_brea> ok maybe
08:06:14 <take_a_deep_brea> i personally setup separately for each profile
08:07:42 <tidria[m]> If it's not an inherent function it won't pass through to the "secondary" profile
08:07:44 <ch3ster_> using an app or input you vpn config info into the android vpn
08:08:18 <tidria[m]> If memory serves privateDNS has to be configured per profile
08:08:48 <tidria[m]> For VPN you would setup your app on either profile and toggle the aforementioned options
08:09:10 <tidria[m]> You then need to flick the VPN on per instance for network access
08:11:17 <strcat[m]> Private DNS is a global setting
08:11:48 <strcat[m]> profiles can be forbidden from configuring it
08:11:52 <strcat[m]> but it's not per-profile
08:12:11 <tidria[m]> Was there a time when it wasn't? I recall having to reconfigure it twice
08:12:21 <strcat[m]> I don't think so
08:12:28 <tidria[m]> Might have been for opposing servers, I can't recall
08:13:06 <datacloud[m]> <nscnt[m] "data.cloud: If you visit a searc"> Found it, thank you!
08:14:00 <tidria[m]> VPN isn't global though right str? At a glance it's working how I outlined above right?
08:14:17 <deappledapple> VPN is per user
08:14:47 <tidria[m]> Phew, I thought I'd been wasting a ton of time there for a second
08:16:34 <take_a_deep_brea> no
08:20:26 <ch3ster_> so when it says private dns mode in android system settings on the owner profile, and its set to automatic. is that using my purchased vnp providers dns that its getting 'automatic' from the app i installed?
08:22:15 <take_a_deep_brea>  * no , you have not been wasting time
08:23:31 <ch3ster_> thanks tidria[m] strcat[m] deappledapple and take_a_deep_brea
08:24:32 <strcat[m]> ch3ster_: if you're using a VPN, the VPN is providing the network's DNS servers (other than bootstrapping the VPN)
08:24:46 <strcat[m]> the VPN is the network for everything but bootstrapping it
08:25:04 <strcat[m]> ch3ster_: 'automatic' for Private DNS means not overriding the network provided DNS servers
08:25:10 <strcat[m]> it's the default
08:25:27 <strcat[m]> it upgrades to DNS-over-TLS opportunistically - it's not really relevant for a VPN
08:25:51 <ch3ster_> wow! thanks for explaining it to me. apprecaite it strcat[m]
08:26:28 <strcat[m]> if you force a DNS-over-TLS server by manually setting one, it will communicate with it over the VPN tunnel
08:26:52 <strcat[m]> there's documentation on this in our FAQ
08:27:02 <strcat[m]> multiple sections on DNS
08:27:20 <ch3ster_> okay, thanks i will read the faq again more carefully this time.
08:37:24 <TheLoneWanderer[> I noticed that the GrapheneOS wiki states that maintainers are needed for extended device support. Who are the current maintainers (and which device)?
08:40:02 <ch3ster_> What is fused location, it suddenly appeared in my system settings under location permissions and its allowed all the time?
08:58:44 <rny> we dont even have fused location services. The only location provider is gnss
09:22:40 <ch3ster_> weird, its in my apps section under if i set it to "show system". I have location off in my owner profile, while in my secondary (personal) profile, location services is on and its showing fused location "allowed all the time"
09:24:50 <ch3ster_> rny, and both owner profile and secondary profile both have vpn app installed. I just switched over to owner profile, turned location services on, and there is 0 apps for it. Im really curious as to where it came from. i mean i did accidently in vanadium browser on secondary profile go to protonmail.com and click on android up, it took me to google play website. but i closed it right away.
09:25:01 * lezogeek[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ONJifxMCdaCUJWcgOPvClYYL/message.txt >
09:32:52 <ch3ster_> I keep seeing a message in notifications pull down menu, saying android system - charging this device via usb. but there is no usb cable plugged into phone, it wont let me clear it from notifications neither. is that normal
09:36:40 <ch3ster_> as for the fused location being allowed all the time, when i try to stop it, it says " fused locatoin is a provider of location services for this devic. location access can be modified from location settings. when i press that, it shows "see all" and nothing there, i then select show system, and there is nothing there. and rny mentioned you guys dont have fused location services. im confused as to where it came from??
09:48:54 <cb473> Hello, hope everyone is well and keeping safe. I was wondering if anyone has been successful getting the mySudo .apk working on GrapheneOS or if there is a work around?
09:48:59 <Albakham[m]> <tree79 "i open the app, i click log in, "> I had the same problem with my banking app, I suppose that's because they need some gapps verification on the phone
09:56:13 <cb473> Ah, acknowledge that, mine is failing to connect so had assumed it was gapps related. Shame as I was hoping to use my paid account (currently on an iOS device) on pixel. I'm content to change in order to get a similar VOIP capability for GOS pixel, any recommendations? Very many thanks
10:00:32 <r0tt0r[m]> strcat latest update fixed 4g calling 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
10:41:34 <rny> lezogeek[m]: the gnss location provider requires a clear line of sight to satelites
10:41:52 <rny> if you have not used it for a while, it needs to download almanacs from the gps satelites which can take a while
10:42:19 <rny> ch3ster: how to re-produce?
10:48:35 <ch3ster> rny, i dunno, i setup gos, followed the faq about profiles, owner is to manage other profiles. owner profile i download apk for ivpn, set it up, then created attenstation.app account from laptop, and setup remote scheduling through auditor app. i then created secondary personal profile, some people here explained how the networking works between profiles etc, i then downloaded the ivpn apk again on second profile installed, all was good. and
10:48:36 <ch3ster> was poking aroud in the system settings, and saw location was turned on and 2 apps have access, one of them was always on access, which as fused location. which was weird, cause i checked everything in owner profile before i setup the secondary profile, and i already had ivpn installed on owner profile. but there werent any location services on
10:49:14 <rny> if they are system apps, you do not need to be concerned
10:50:02 <rny> fused location the location service provider that "fuses" network/gps location providers to provide your location
10:50:26 <rny> in graphene os, there is no network provider, so fused provider only uses the gnss capability to resolve your location
10:50:39 <ch3ster> okay, well thats what i thought, i shouldnt be concerned, but then i asked here, and you mentioned that gos doesnt use fuse
10:50:53 <ch3ster> ohhh
10:51:00 <ch3ster> okay, i understand now
10:51:01 <ch3ster> thank you
10:51:04 <rny> obviously, so that fused provider is actually able read/update the latest location in the service, it needs location permission, otherwise it cant even use the GPS hardware
10:51:24 <ch3ster> :-)
10:52:27 <rny> apps never get location directly from hardware, they get it from the fused location service
10:52:42 <rny> and the fused location service will resolve the actual location using hardware
10:53:30 <ch3ster> i see. thank you. that's starting to make sense more, i did read about that on the site, but didnt quite understand it. thanks for clearing all this up
10:54:16 <rny> no prob
12:13:00 <precentor[m]> hi, how do you manually update graphene? i tap on "check for updates" in "system update settings" and nothing happens
12:14:30 <take_a_deep_brea> precentor:  that means there are no updates for the update channel on which you are which should be the stable  channel
12:14:47 <take_a_deep_brea> beta channel does have updates though
12:15:10 <take_a_deep_brea> but beta is more for testing wether the updates break anything
12:15:36 <precentor[m]> inst 2021.01.23.03 a stable channel release? it was released yesterday afaik
12:16:01 <take_a_deep_brea> though it does happen that a beta update is the same as a stable channel update when nothing regresses because of changes made to the OS
12:17:36 <precentor[m]> oh, 2021.01.23.03 is a beta cahnnel update, nvm then
12:17:38 <precentor[m]> thanks tho
12:17:43 <take_a_deep_brea> no not yet
12:18:08 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel
12:18:30 <take_a_deep_brea> it still says : 21-01-05
12:18:33 <r0tt0r[m]> due quality of work yet no problems with beta rollouts here
12:18:48 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
12:19:15 <precentor[m]> yeah, thats what i said, the stable channel has not received the 2021.01.23.03 update, but the beta one has ^^
12:19:51 <precentor[m]> Beta channel
12:19:51 <precentor[m]> Pixel 4a
12:19:51 <precentor[m]> Version: RQ1A.210105.002.**2021.01.23.03**
12:19:53 <take_a_deep_brea> r0tt0r: in fact thank you because i had not noticed the beta channel on the site and was only looking at the stable channel puzzled as to why i wasnt getting an update , lol
12:29:14 <r0tt0r[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "r0tt0r: in fact thank you becaus"> np the stable comes normally some time after
12:42:22 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
14:18:09 <tealopintoscom[m> What do I do if I don't seem to receive the last GOS update and tapping the check for updates doesn't pull it?
14:51:49 <lumpenqueer[m]> Are there specific USB storage devices that are compatible with graphene, or should any android compatible one work
14:52:23 <strcat[m]> ch3ster: sounds like you installed an app and granting it location access, dunno why you're confused
14:56:11 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: any OTG compatible one should work
14:56:45 <lumpenqueer[m]> <strcat "lumpenqueer: any OTG compatible "> Thank you, I really appreciate it
15:14:26 <quartz11[m]> does somebody know why fdroid doesn't install in a profile?
15:31:46 <EXODIA> What are some apps you folks really like?
16:44:07 <FChangeFSoc> Just a simple question since I can't tell by looking at the release notes. Has the Pixel 2 reached the end of support with the last version?
16:45:17 <take_a_deep_brea> FChangeFSoc: yes it has. as it does not get anymore firmware updates from Qualcomm
16:45:56 <FChangeFSoc> Ah I see. Well from my understanding even an outdated version of Graphene would be stronger than like 99% of Custom Roms and even factory images
16:48:24 <take_a_deep_brea> FChangeFSoc: that may be true , but the fact is unupdated firmware will certainlly accumulate bugs that are discovered and as time passes it wil be easier for someone to use those vulnerabilities ( not exactly easy but very much possible ) in a creative manner to exploit your system and hence it is possible to compromise even old grapheneOS images
16:49:01 <take_a_deep_brea> not something that has been done.it is very difficult do what i just said.
16:49:43 <take_a_deep_brea> but it remains very much a possibility . that is why these bugs are fixed in the first place . many of us will never notice anything wrong with the UI .
16:53:38 <take_a_deep_brea> man what was that ? wa sit so bad , lol
16:53:45 <take_a_deep_brea>  * man what was that ? was it so bad , lol

17:12:06 <somenerd[m]> hey this is quite cool
17:12:16 <eglssm[m]> Also I read that initial builds for pixel 5 and pixel 4a 5g are being tested, even more awesome
17:14:27 <eglssm[m]> I just wonder what the project would have already accomplished without wasting resources due to third party assholes continuously harming the project
17:26:15 <Albakham[m]> It is not possible to share the connexion (access point or USB) from the phone to a computer while on secondary profile, is it?
17:26:50 <Albakham[m]> I see it's only possible on the admin profile, and once I go to my secondary profile, it stops the network share
17:52:02 <Bob17> Trying to load GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4xl and message "fastboot too old" keeps coming up. Using Windows, I've set path as indicated in the install guide, but still no success. Is there a solution for this?
17:52:52 <Albakham[m]> <Bob17 "Trying to load GrapheneOS on a P"> try the web installer? 🙂
17:53:00 <dumpstak> you have to download the last version
17:53:16 <Bob17> fastboot version is 30.0.5 just downloaded
17:53:34 <dumpstak> powershell or cmd?
17:53:49 <Bob17> powershell or cmd both have same result
17:54:36 <dumpstak> where u download from?
17:54:45 <Bob17> direct from google
17:55:09 <Albakham[m]>  Is it wrong to recommand the new https://grapheneos.org/install/web ?
17:55:09 <Albakham[m]> It doesn't require fastboot, just a browser
17:55:31 <dumpstak> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
17:56:24 <Bob17> I'll try the web installer. Thanks for the tip!
17:56:27 <dumpstak> the web install is an epochal change but must be tested, is experimental
18:08:48 <AlwaysLivid> Hey, out of curiosity, are the generic builds which "work with many Android devices" GSI ROMs?
18:34:30 <take_a_deep_brea> i think so
18:46:28 <colopa> Hello, is there any news regarding Pixel 4a 5G support?
18:47:27 <colopa> Can we expect support in the next months?
18:48:11 <mynacol[m]> colopa: It's in the workings. It's ready if it is ready. So sometime soon(tm)
18:49:51 <mynacol[m]>  * colopa: It's in the workings. It's ready if it is ready. So sometime soon™
19:48:57 <BootyLover[m]> why does graphene come with google for dns, or am i missing something?
19:49:36 <mynacol[m]> BootyLover: It doesn't. Where have you read that?
19:49:55 <BootyLover[m]> i saw thru netguard, it was calling on dns.google
19:50:15 <BootyLover[m]> the requests were blocked, but it threw me off
19:50:23 <BootyLover[m]> so im confused what that was
19:51:07 <snooopy> BootyLover[m]: More details should be found here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-dns
19:51:43 <mynacol[m]> I assume DNS Daemon contacted dns.google on port 853? I have seen similar things.
19:52:30 <mynacol[m]> It could be the configured DNS server of a network each uses
19:53:46 <BootyLover[m]> thanks
19:55:28 <lodtank> perhaps a config in your router?
19:57:55 <casaouuii[m]> Hey guys, i have a question about orbot
19:58:04 <BootyLover[m]> hmm, i guess ill find out when i know more about dns
19:58:10 <casaouuii[m]> When i use it full vpn mode, a lot of things dont work
19:58:31 <BootyLover[m]> nextDNS?
20:11:38 <snooopy> casaouuii[m]: What are a lot of things?
20:20:54 <strcat[m]> BootyLover: means the router for the network gave you Google DNS as the network provided DNS server
20:20:55 <strcat[m]> assuming it's a Wi-Fi network, that probably means someone configured the router to use Google DNS instead of getting the DNS servers from the ISP
20:22:21 <strcat[m]> the default DNS-over-TLS mode is 'Automatic' meaning it still uses the network provided servers but attempts to use DNS-over-TLS to provide opportunistic protection against passive monitoring
20:22:33 <strcat[m]> unless you configured the OS to use Google DNS, it's not the OS deciding to use it
20:22:52 <BootyLover[m]> @strcat:matrix.org:  ah, i see
20:22:58 <BootyLover[m]> Thank you
20:23:30 <BootyLover[m]> i changed my dns setting, private dns to nextdns.io
20:23:51 <BootyLover[m]> i see a lot of requests going to the dns, why is that?
20:24:02 <BootyLover[m]> i didnt see that previously
20:24:05 <strcat[m]> that means it will use the network provided DNS to resolve nextdns.io and then resolve everything else via DNS-over-TLS
20:24:35 <strcat[m]> I don't think NetGuard shows regular DNS queries via the OS, it could, but doesn't
20:24:43 <strcat[m]> and worth noting an application could exfiltrate data via DNS to their own servers
20:25:02 <strcat[m]> the VPN gets to provide DNS resolution
20:25:28 <strcat[m]> Private DNS overrides the network provided DNS (including VPN provided DNS) and does DNS via TLS connections
20:25:46 <strcat[m]> so those just get routed via the VPN and it's opaque to it
20:26:11 <strcat[m]> the only thing resolved via the network provided DNS is the domain name of the configured Private DNS hostname
20:26:25 <strcat[m]> BootyLover: also you didn't say *what* was making that connection
20:26:39 <strcat[m]> an app can of course connect to Google DNS directly if it wants
20:26:44 <strcat[m]> if it has the Network permission
20:27:04 <BootyLover[m]> the log isnt showing an app for that connections
20:27:06 <strcat[m]> normal DNS resolution ends up being delegated to the OS, which uses network provided DNS servers unless you override it
20:27:24 <strcat[m]> BootyLover: anyway, definitely not GrapheneOS choosing to use it
20:27:37 <strcat[m]> AOSP / GrapheneOS use network provided DNS unless the network is broken
20:27:52 <strcat[m]> and our fallback when the network is broken and has no DNS is Cloudflare DNS not Google DNS - but few networks are that broken
20:27:52 <BootyLover[m]> i see
20:28:50 <mynacol[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I have seen the requests too. According to NetGuard "DNS Daemon" (android.dns) does request dns.google (e.g. 8.8.8.8) on port 853
20:30:01 <BootyLover[m]> im confused why i see so many of those requests going out sometimes
20:30:51 <strcat[m]> mynacol: again, read what I said above
20:31:04 <strcat[m]> if your carrier, etc. uses Google DNS that's their choice
20:31:04 <mynacol[m]> I cannot really explain that, as my mobile network operator uses their DNS server and the only WiFi connection should also use their DNS service (not 100% sure, but strange that others have seen that as well)
20:31:32 <mynacol[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I will further observe when the connection attempts happen
20:35:21 <strcat[m]> NetGuard doesn't appear to show regular DNS queries though, so you're missing those
20:35:30 <strcat[m]> it only shows the DNS-over-TLS ones
20:43:27 <tealopintoscom[m> Is there a way to clone an app more than once with any app such as shelter so that I can run multiple accounts in parallel?
20:43:37 <strcat[m]> user profiles
20:45:33 <tealopintoscom[m> Okay so in the case of user profiles is there a way to clone a profile with and apps and settings and expedite the switching process?
20:45:52 <tealopintoscom[m> E.g. fdroid, vpn apps etc
20:47:06 <mynacol[m]> tealopintoscom: No
20:47:51 <tealopintoscom[m> Got it
20:48:30 <tealopintoscom[m> So for every profile you would download fdroid then set up a vpn then the actual app you wanted
20:51:16 <mynacol[m]> tealopintoscom: And you should read up how user profiles and network access relate to each other. I don't find the right link
20:52:15 <mynacol[m]> The gist is, profiles share the same network connection sometimes
21:00:13 <strcat[m]> mynacol: port 853 is DNS-over-TLS so that's a DNS-over-TLS connection, in automatic mode that means the network is using Google DNS and it upgraded to DNS-over-TLS
21:00:57 <strcat[m]>  * mynacol: port 853 is DNS-over-TLS so that's a DNS-over-TLS connection, in automatic mode that means the network is using Google DNS and the OS upgraded to DNS-over-TLS (or is at least trying to)
21:35:00 <super_noob[m]> Hello Everyone.
21:35:35 <super_noob[m]> Trying to install grapheneOS.
21:36:15 <super_noob[m]> I've gotten to the "./flash-all.bat" step
21:36:19 <mynacol[m]> super_noob: Hi, carefully follow https://grapheneos.org/install/
21:36:50 <super_noob[m]> yep, that's the page I've  been using as my guide.
21:37:43 <mynacol[m]> super_noob 👍
21:38:23 <snooopy> super_noob[m]: Did you try the webinstall-method?
21:38:44 <super_noob[m]> No, been using powershell
21:38:57 <snooopy> okay. :)
21:40:02 <super_noob[m]> should i have used the webinstall method instead?
21:41:07 <nscnt[m]> super_noob: No, it's fine with PowerShell
21:41:33 <snooopy> No, I think your way is good, but the web installer looks like a very easy process and I'm very curious if it just works without major problems :)
21:43:05 <super_noob[m]> From what I  can tell, after enter the flash command, everything "seems"  to go fine until  "fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable."
21:43:47 <super_noob[m]> But before that,  I see"archive does not contain 'boot.sig'"
21:46:26 <mynacol[m]> super_noob: The "archive does not contain ..." errors are no problem
21:47:58 <super_noob[m]> OK, I thought perhaps  I should  move the .sig  file into the folder  for the  release file.
21:51:02 <super_noob[m]> The last error message i receive is "fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable."
21:52:25 <nux> super_noob[m]: What hardware?
21:52:43 <super_noob[m]> Google Pixle 3 XL
21:53:11 <nux> super_noob[m]: Should be good then.
21:53:26 <nscnt[m]> super_noob: And what factory image did you download?
21:54:14 <super_noob[m]> crosshatch-factory-2021.01.05.03
21:56:59 <nscnt[m]> Unsure what the issue could be
21:57:55 <mynacol[m]> strcat can you have a look at this?
21:58:51 <strcat[m]> at what?
21:59:15 <strcat[m]> unbootable userspace fastboot means vbmeta/boot/dtbo weren't flashed properly
21:59:20 <strcat[m]> sounds like a bad USB connection
21:59:41 <strcat[m]> web installer won't fix USB issues
22:00:32 <super_noob[m]> USB, as in the port, or  the cable? I'm using the original USB Cable
22:01:52 <mynacol[m]> super_noob: Then try another port if available
22:01:53 <TheJollyRoger> Could be the port, if you're using a good quality cable. Some PC vendors we've found have been extremely sloppy or careless with how they implement USB.
22:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> Since very few people will use the entire gamut of features available to USB.
22:03:00 <super_noob[m]> Hmm. laptop  only has one USB-C port, which is what the phone came with.
22:04:21 <mynacol[m]> super_noob: Do you have a good quality USB A to C cable?
22:06:45 <super_noob[m]> Afraid not. Just went looking for one.
22:07:54 <super_noob[m]> And the phone only came with a  female USB-A/Male USB-C adaptor
22:09:01 <super_noob[m]> I'd like to mention, I don't currently see  the phone on my device manager, which I have in the past. And I did have issues with "< waiting for any device >"
22:10:07 <TheJollyRoger> The USB-C implementation on that PC might be broken, buggy, or incomplete, if you've done everything else right.
22:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> NYF (Not Your Fault) we've seen this happen before where people do everything right but it's the PC that messes things up.
22:10:59 <mynacol[m]> super_noob Maybe you can use another/a friends computer?
22:11:20 <TheJollyRoger> Due to vendors being sloppy or careless about things.
22:12:20 <super_noob[m]> Do you  think it's the USB-C port driver, or the port itself?
22:12:43 <super_noob[m]> Yes, I might be able to  use another pc.
22:13:09 <TheJollyRoger> Possibly the port, or the chip that talks to the port, if everything else software side is working and up to date.
22:13:10 <lasseter[m]> I have a photo app I can get from Aurora that uses a few trackers.  The app doesn't need network access to function, however.  If I deny network access to the app from app info -> permissions, am I effectively preventing it from phoning home?  Are these permission settings a GOS thing or something that is common to Android?
22:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> lasseter[m]: The "Network" and "Settings" permission toggles are unique to GrapheneOS and downstream forks of it. They are very specifically not permitted in the Android specification, so technically GrapheneOS is breaking compatibility with Android by allowing them.
22:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> If you deny Network permissions to an app, it will deny both direct and indirect network access to the application.
22:17:27 <lasseter[m]> That is amazing.  I'm a few weeks into this experiment and loving it.  Thanks!
22:18:28 <TheJollyRoger> lasseter[m]: glad to hear you're liking GrapheneOS! (be sure to drop the devs a donation if you can and find the software useful at https://grapheneos.org/donate , the project's entirely funded on donations to keep going!)
22:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> Note that apps are not "GrapheneOS aware" and do not "know" to request or not request network and sensors permissions in their manifests,
22:19:31 <TheJollyRoger> so that's why those permissions are enabled by default, since turning them off can cause some apps to break.
22:20:20 <TheJollyRoger> Fortunately, if you're concerned about an app phoning home, Android (and by extension, Graphene) installs all apps in the "Halted" or "Stopped" state, so they can't be started unless you start them. So you can open their properties, and then deny permissions prior to first launch.
22:23:33 <hashenstein[m]> Does the ProtonMail android client work with GrapheneOS?
22:23:43 <EXODIA> I am liking the graphene, still trying to find replacements for certain apps or reduce any and all apps that having tracking built into the app as shown from aurora. Which atm, is not working anymore for me.
22:23:44 <EXODIA> Curious as to what folks are using App wise as a daily driver
22:23:49 <EXODIA> hashenstein[m] yes
22:24:30 <TheJollyRoger> hashenstein[m]: I have heard anecdotal reports that the protonmail app works, but notifications are GSF dependent. This means that while the app runs, you will not be notified of new mail until you open the app.
22:24:48 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <EXODIA "Curious as to what folks are usi"> Any specific kind of apps or just in general?
22:24:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "hashenstein: I have heard anecdo"> Can confirm
22:26:04 <TheJollyRoger> For apps, I've mostly run just Signal, FairEmail, OpenCamera, Simple Gallery, Music Player Go, and that's about it. I do have Tor Browser installed but I hardly use it.
22:26:30 <snooopy> EXODIA: yeah, leaving tracking apps behind can be hard
22:27:09 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I mostly use Signal, FairEmail, OpenCamera, Google Photos Go for gallery, Vinyl music player
22:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> I don't generally use things like Skip The Dishes, or Uber Eats, even these days, since I've got a proper convection oven and a gas stove now.
22:27:36 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I have this Element in a separate profile
22:27:52 <hashenstein[m]> I had a cool pomodoro timer app for productivity called Forest that stopped working when I switched to GrapheneOS. Still looking for a replacement.
22:28:21 <TheJollyRoger> (If you ever want to become less dependent on takeout or delivery food, you can do what I did and buy a set of really good quality cookware, pots, pans, good quality kitchen utensils, etc.)
22:28:34 <EXODIA> Android Auto is out the window obviously, but music or video streaming, car scenario apps.
22:28:35 <EXODIA> Signal I am finding hes significant delay in receiving messages for me. I switched back to the default.
22:28:35 <EXODIA> I am liking Orbot and how that gives granular control to apps.
22:28:52 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <hashenstein[m] "I had a cool pomodoro timer app "> Now I am really intrigued by what that timer does, that Grapheme caused it to stop working
22:29:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> * Now I am really intrigued by what that timer does, that Graphene caused it to stop working
22:29:53 <EXODIA> Bitwarden, osmand+, supProd, Proton, Wallpapers, Aegis atm
22:30:20 <hashenstein[m]> Yeah, me too. It just crashes on open.
22:30:43 <TheJollyRoger> hashenstein[m]: if an app crashes on opening on GrapheneOS, then there are two possibilities I can think of:
22:31:15 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <EXODIA "Bitwarden, osmand+, supProd, Pro"> Oh, yeah I am also using Aegis
22:31:25 <snooopy> Threema, Conversations, K-9 mail, Etar, F-Droid, Öffi, Nextcloud :)
22:31:33 <snooopy> and a few more.
22:31:41 <TheJollyRoger> The first possibility is that it's dependent in some way on Google Software Framework, and the app authors have not written it to function with a fallback or fail gracefully, and just let it crash.
22:31:53 <TheJollyRoger> *and just let it crash if Play Services are absent.
22:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> The second possibility is that if the app is very, very old and/or it makes an unsafe call, GrapheneOS may stop it to prevent it from attempting to exploit the operating system.
22:34:05 <hashenstein[m]> I bet that's it. I like the app enough that I'll probably open a support ticket.
22:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> This behaviour is extremely rare, I've only seen it happen maybe about twice out of a lot of the different apps I've tried off F-Droid. In both cases I remember, the apps were >5 years old at this point and were since abandoned.
22:35:11 <TheJollyRoger> But if the app makes an unsafe call it's better to stop it now, than let it turn into a vulnerability or let it try to exploit the operating system.
22:35:13 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "For apps, I've mostly run just S"> So what do you use instead of tor browser - orbit and vanadium / bromite?
22:35:22 <TheJollyRoger> Just Vanadium.
22:35:42 <TheJollyRoger> I bear in mind the rule of "Don't cross the streams" when using Tor.
22:35:57 <TheJollyRoger> Rather than just "Torify everything, lol."
22:36:09 <EXODIA> lol
22:36:34 <justanotherlurke> Ah, I see...
22:36:37 <TheJollyRoger> Note as well, I also use the defaults on everything. I very deliberately do not custom tune.
22:36:49 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I have a profile, which is using Orbot as always on
22:37:39 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I am trying to go for Qubes-like mental isolation. As in having a Personal profile, a Public profile, etc.
22:37:43 <TheJollyRoger> This is not because I'm lazy, but rather, it's because I understand that competent developers that I trust have thought things out far better than I have and often make choices in their design using elements that I possibly never thought of.
22:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> *design, taking into account elements that I possibly never thought of.
22:38:20 <TheJollyRoger> And I as an end-user, especially one that's not in a position to make these decisions, contravene their advice at my own peril.
22:38:47 <EXODIA> SkyFox[kdeorg][m good concept or line of thought for sure.. TheJollyRoger trying my best to use it as minimal as I can.
22:38:55 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
22:38:57 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "This is not because I'm lazy, bu"> That's what I see with the defaults in GOS.
22:39:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr-harr, indeed shipmate :D
22:40:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "I am trying to go for Qubes-like"> I also deny the network permission for apps in the Public profile, when they are not in use... I think I might have some mild paranoia
22:41:31 <justanotherlurke> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "I have a profile, which is using"> So do you always log out of that one when using another one to prevent leaks?
22:41:53 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Most of the time
22:42:22 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I don't log out, if I just need to check for messages in the Personal profiles
22:43:25 <justanotherlurke> As far,as I understood, apps in a background profile could/do use the foreground network ...
22:43:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Tbh, though, I probably leaked my IP with this setup. I am not an expert in this
22:44:22 <EXODIA> For open mail clients, if you have to use google for work or otherwise should you just entirely avoid having it a personal phone and opt for a dedicated work phone or can a reasonable amount of trust or countermeasures be put in place to allow gmail still on graphene through the open mail client
22:44:59 <justanotherlurke> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "I also deny the network permissi"> Does temporary removal of network permission make sense, if apps can store date and exfiltrate later?

23:07:27 <Canada_Igloo> Hello, I have a question in regards to using GrapheneOS with Pixel phones, is someone available to give me a bit of insight?
23:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Canada_Igloo, welcome aboard. What could I answer for ye?
23:09:04 <TheJollyRoger> hashenstein[m], EXODIA ccasionally, Aurora store's account gets banned for violating the terms of Play Service, and when that happens, Aurora Store temporarily goes out until they can switch to another one.
23:09:14 <TheJollyRoger> *Play Services
23:09:51 <Canada_Igloo> Thanks. I'm curious as to the usage of GrapheneOS with Pixel phones, since the whole idea is to "de-google" your phone, yet the product(s) themselves are literally Google devices. What kind of assurance is there that even if you put GrapheneOS on the phone, that there may still be some baked-in privacy concerning modules/programming/etc in the
23:09:51 <Canada_Igloo> devices hardware itself?
23:10:17 <TheJollyRoger> I get asked this question a lot, and to put it best, simple game theory:
23:11:20 <Serus> Hello
23:11:23 <TheJollyRoger> The pixels actually don't make that much money for Google. Instead, Google's revenue comes from other people and other OEMs buying into and being a part of the Android Ecosystem, while enjoying significant amounts of lenience in using the Android trademark, application stores, and support from upstream. The Google devices are a reference implementation of that.
23:11:39 <Serus> Canada_Igloo: You have to start trusting some organization somewhere
23:11:48 <TheJollyRoger> This means that essentially, Google has its pride on the line with them, and should people lose confidence in those devices, guess where they're going to be going? Probably Apple.
23:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, it makes no sense for Google to backdoor the devices at a low level. Those tend to be easiest ones to catch.
23:12:24 <Serus> You go open source, now it comes down to trusting your hardware/CPU. You go open source hardware, now it comes down to trusting the factory that makes it. etc etc
23:12:39 <Canada_Igloo> Figured it was a common question, was surprised not to see it in any of the FAQ's (unless I missed it).
23:13:34 <Canada_Igloo> Serus, I understand all that...
23:13:41 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "Secondly, it makes no sense for "> And harder to implement too, I am guessing
23:13:53 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: Yep!
23:13:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Especially if you are trying to not get caught
23:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> Google doesn't *need* backdoors. They already have people's trust and co-operation.
23:14:18 <TheJollyRoger> WHY would they want to destroy that?
23:14:43 <Serus> Please exclude this channel when you say they have the people's trust :P
23:14:45 <TheJollyRoger> Why would they gamble their entire reputation and jeopardize that, for being able to play peeping tom?
23:14:55 <Canada_Igloo> Because they can?
23:15:03 <TheJollyRoger> Especially because a hardware backdoor can't be changed after the fact.
23:15:21 <TheJollyRoger> Canada_Igloo: "because they can" doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be profitable for them in the long run.
23:15:27 <Canada_Igloo> I was just surprised to see the main recommended devices for Graphene were literally google devices themselves :P
23:15:33 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, they want projects like GrapheneOS to exist.
23:15:36 <Serus> Me too, Canada_Igloo
23:15:51 <Serus> So I have a question myself
23:15:56 <TheJollyRoger> Canada_Igloo: did you know that Google has to /pay extra/ to get Qualcomm to allow them to use rekeyable bootloaders?
23:16:00 <Canada_Igloo> I feel like if Google were to produce whatever device, they'd slip something into the hardware no matter what
23:16:38 <Serus> I've read on reddit that oneplus is not supported, but not exactly why, only that their security track record is bad.
23:16:39 <Canada_Igloo> @TheJollyRoger no, but doesn't surprise me
23:16:46 <TheJollyRoger> Canada_Igloo: You've probably come from /r/Privacy, I'm guessing. I'd probably say to tune out those SDPEs.
23:16:53 <TheJollyRoger> (SDPE
23:16:59 <TheJollyRoger> - Self Defeating Privacy Enthusiast)
23:17:13 <Canada_Igloo> No, never been to that subreddit, and I don't generally care for reddit's toxic opinions on things
23:17:15 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "Google doesn't *need* backdoors."> I also think, this is one of the reasons *Apple* is better for privacy than pretty much any  stock Android. Because they have a reputation for being this way and they want to maintain it. Otherwise people would just leave
23:17:19 <Serus> Canada_Igloo: Backdoors can be used by others too, Google wants exclusive access to your data
23:17:20 <TheJollyRoger> Good.
23:17:28 <Canada_Igloo> SDPE? Really
23:17:31 <Canada_Igloo> lol...
23:17:43 <Serus> So anyway
23:17:59 <Serus> Can anybody go more in depth on what's exactly wrong with a oneplus 6t?
23:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, Self-Defeating Privacy Enthusiasts - the type of people that tell you to turn off Windows Update and run this shady app to "Make Windows 10 Private."
23:18:21 <Canada_Igloo> @Serus I understand that backdoors can be used by others...
23:18:49 <TheJollyRoger> Canada_Igloo: The irony of buying Google to get off Google isn't lost on any of us, but I'll break it down:
23:19:23 <Serus> It's the device I am using myself, and currently I am running a custom build of lineageos 17.1 with patches to get AVB back.
23:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> One blocker is that no other vendor is willing to shoulder the cost themselves to support verified boot with third-party keys. At one time, it was hoped that OnePlus and Xiaomi would, but their implementations turned out to be so laughably buggy and insecure they didn't meet the project's standards anyways.
23:20:15 <Serus> How do I test the AVB implementation on my OP6T, TheJollyRoger?
23:21:05 <TheJollyRoger> Another one, is that vendor commitment is needed to ensure timely security updates. This means timely delivery of security updates and working closely with upstream AOSP. There aren't any other vendors that do this.
23:21:14 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "One blocker is that no other ven"> Wait, did Xiaomi try supporting 3rd party keys?
23:22:14 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: yes, a bit. It was hoped that the Mi A2 would allow verified boot support with third party keys, but the implementation turned out to be flawed. One Plus also had the same - it was found you could turn on verified boot and then boot an image unverified.
23:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> Serus: you'll have to ask someone more knowledgeable than I for that.
23:22:52 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I thought Mi A2's support was an accident
23:22:53 <Serus> I actually regret nog getting a pixel, but they're really hard to get here
23:23:02 <Serus> And I am poor lmao
23:23:24 <Serus> Would it be a lot of work to port graphene to it?
23:23:25 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not completely up to date on it unfortunately :P. But at least that's been the status of those devices here.
23:23:32 <TheJollyRoger> Serus: I'll let you in on a little secret:
23:23:53 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS can actually be compiled for devices it itself does not support.
23:24:03 <TheJollyRoger> If your goal is to "get it to boot" that's actually very easy.
23:24:09 <Serus> That's exactly what I was asking :D
23:24:16 <Serus> I don't mind compiling it myself
23:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS can indeed be compiled for devices it does not officially support, and it's been done. You'd need to port a lot of the work to it yourself, and likely you will find that there are device-specific workarounds that you'll need to do.
23:25:00 <TheJollyRoger> However, I should note:
23:25:03 <Serus> I already compile my own lineageos builds so I can have AVB and built-in fdroid-privileged extension
23:25:04 <TheJollyRoger> There's always a but.
23:25:12 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Well then you're probably already set.
23:25:36 <TheJollyRoger> For others who might have been following and wanted to hear the but:
23:26:38 <Canada_Igloo> Thanks for the insight then, TheJollyRoger.. been looking for a long while now on what to do/buy, I want to leave the android ecosystem, just not sure which device/OS is best suited
23:26:41 <Canada_Igloo> Lots of stuff still in somewhat raw stages still
23:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> It's not an exercise to be undertaken lightly. It's one thing to get an operating system to boot, but it's very much a full-time job to stay on top of security updates, host your own update infrastructure, and keep applying the device-specific workarounds and hardening. You're going to need to maintain your own key handling infrastructure, for the lifespan of the device.
23:27:28 <TheJollyRoger> This is why having enough maintainers is important and it's important they have enough time to devote to each device.
23:27:41 <Serus> oh yeah, my stuff isn't automated at all, I do it all manually
23:27:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's definitely not something I can do at this point with my knowledge.
23:28:15 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <Canada_Igloo "Thanks for the insight then, The"> AFAIK, Apple is currently the only convenient way to leave the Android ecosystem
23:28:21 <TheJollyRoger> Canada_Igloo: if you're looking to leave Android, consider an iPhone, at this moment.
23:28:34 <Canada_Igloo> lol, I'll pass on apple products, thanks though...
23:28:40 <Serus> I wouldn't go with an iphone to be honest
23:29:00 <Canada_Igloo> seems like a rather crap response when seeking privacy
23:29:06 <Serus> They have been found spying on Uyghur muslims for at least 2 months, possibly upwards to 2 years
23:29:30 <Serus> or well, an unfixed vulnerability which has been used that way
23:29:57 <Serus> Personally, if I had the money, I'd sell my current phone and get a pixel 4 and put graphene on it
23:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> Pixel 4s are good, I have one. It's a nice phone, but I just wish they were better value. They cost a lot of money and don't give you a lot of value for it.
23:30:58 <TheJollyRoger> The 4as though present some great value.
23:31:08 <TheJollyRoger> And they're newer and will last longer.
23:31:10 <Serus> eh, the privacy is a good value though
23:31:15 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed.
23:31:21 <Serus> privacy should ideally be free, but I am willing to pay for it
23:31:41 <Serus> My boss used to say that privacy would become a luxury product, and I believe him
23:32:06 <snooopy> I have a 4a and I'm very happy with it, and grapheneOS makes it even better
23:32:08 <TheJollyRoger> Well, that's what the reality is, we need to either make the transaction in one way or another. For some people, they pay with their future. For us, we pay with our wallets.
23:32:15 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: Yarr! Glad to hear!
23:33:18 <snooopy> in theory, the gdpr in europe should give privacy to us all
23:33:25 <Serus> Just wondering, can't find this in the faq, does graphene come with f-droid privileged extension?
23:33:35 <snooopy> but the system fails against facebook. :/
23:33:42 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: fingers crossed it can be leveraged better as time goes on!
23:34:09 <TheJollyRoger> Serus: GrapheneOS doesn't ship the F-Droid Privileged Extension, so you'll have to approve app installs manually.
23:34:21 <TheJollyRoger> This just means one extra tap each time you want to update or install.
23:35:08 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: yeah, and luckily, we have some people who are doing their best to give us more privacy!
23:35:12 <TheJollyRoger> This is actually a very deliberate design choice not to include the F-Droid privileged extension, since we consider F-Droid itself, and many of the apps on it to be insecure and contain large amounts of legacy code.
23:35:31 <Serus> Was about to ask
23:35:33 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: Drink to the future! P.-)
23:35:34 <Serus> Makes sense
23:35:50 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: \o/
23:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. GrapheneOS has wanted to include a first-party app store of curated apps that would be updated directly via upstream, or have in-house maintainers, but that's for the future, when more manpower or co-operation with upstream app publishers is available.
23:37:18 <Serus> What would be a cool alternative would be a quick and dirty website that shows alternatives to commonly used apps
23:37:41 <TheJollyRoger> If we did have an application store, we'd want to follow the standard Android practice of the app developers /themselves/ holding the keys to their own respective apps, so that neither GrapheneOS nor any of the other app developers become a "trusted third party."
23:37:43 <Serus> A friend of mine criticized me, when I told him I would stop using whatsapp, for going back to the "stoneage"
23:37:50 <louipc> direct links to apks
23:38:04 <Serus> But that's not true when almost everything has an open source alternative
23:38:12 <Serus> And perhaps privacy respecting too
23:38:14 <TheJollyRoger> Haha! I think there was a project for that on the EFF, but I can't remember where it was.
23:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> It may be badly out of date as well at this point so if hasn't been updated for a while if you do find it maybe only keep it around for archival only, not actually using it.
23:39:42 <Serus> Right
23:40:02 <TheJollyRoger> Serus: at the risk of coming across as spiteful, I sometimes imagine the reason why F-Droid contains so much legacy code, backwards compatibility, and apps that are compiled for old versions of the Android API, is because a lot of their userbase likely is holding out on ancient and creaking builds of LineageOS they found on XDA on rickety old devices from 2015.
23:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> And they can't afford to break their userbases' workflow.
23:40:31 <Serus> I feel called out lol
23:40:39 * TheJollyRoger turns red.
23:40:43 <TheJollyRoger> Oh god I'm so sorry! XD
23:40:55 * Serus looks at his broken oneplus one on his desk
23:40:59 <TheJollyRoger> Oh noooooo
23:41:02 <Serus> I only use that for my Chinese lessons
23:41:06 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whew!
23:41:15 <Serus> Because the teacher wants to communicate via wechat
23:41:20 <TheJollyRoger> OH YIKES AAAAAAAA
23:41:23 <Serus> And no way I am installing that on my main phone
23:41:28 <TheJollyRoger> Holy shit aaaaaugh!
23:41:43 <Serus> I am hoping I can get her to use literally anything else
23:41:49 <Serus> I even take whatsapp at this point
23:41:51 <Serus> or email
23:41:57 <TheJollyRoger> You know that video of Homer Simpson getting hypnotized and then screaming compulsively while he goes about brushing his teeth, going to work, and tipping the valet...?
23:42:09 <Serus> I'll look it up
23:42:12 <snooopy> I could take a look if I could find my 2.3.7 gingerbread android! :D
23:42:19 <TheJollyRoger> "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *gasp* here you go - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
23:42:34 <TheJollyRoger> That's my reaction whenever WeChat is mentioned!
23:42:34 <snooopy> but thankfully, I won't use this anymore
23:43:40 <Serus> haha, I'm looking at it right now
23:43:55 <Serus> yeah, that was basically my internal reaction
23:44:14 <TheJollyRoger> Serus: https://youtube.com/watch?v=l6Smk2tqDV0
23:44:19 <TheJollyRoger> Oh you found it, good, haha :D
23:45:19 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off the computer for a bit though.
23:45:22 <TheJollyRoger> See you guys later!
23:45:25 <Serus> cya
23:45:33 * Thatcher[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20210124_154352.jpg (25KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DQRbigIUEipnxnwctqSaJeRp/IMG_20210124_154352.jpg >
23:45:34 <Thatcher[m]> Anyone know what app '10042' is? It's showing up in my battery usage
23:46:14 <Thatcher[m]> Tried Googling with no success
23:46:45 <Serus> enable developer mode and ADB, connect to your PC, "adb shell pm packages list | grep 10042"
23:46:50 <Serus> See if that gets you anything
23:47:07 <Serus> inb4 adb shell is completely disable on graphene
23:47:16 * TheJollyRoger rushes back.
23:47:31 <TheJollyRoger> adb shell is allowed on GrapheneOS, set it in developer options. It is off by default.
23:47:38 <Serus> yeah
23:47:39 <TheJollyRoger> *set USB Debugging in developer options.
23:47:41 <kalbasit_> I can't find anything about support for Pixel 5 besides the generic it will be supported once we support it. Honestly, I Just found out about this OS and I'm thinking of investing in a Pixel to get my hands on it. Would a Pixel 5 be a bad investment right now?
23:47:48 <Serus> make sure to turn it back off once you got your answer of course
23:48:01 <Serus> I only enable dev mode when I need to update for advanced restart
23:48:06 <Serus> And then I turn it back off
23:48:24 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit_: Pixel 5 is entering testing right now and the kernel boots, but I don't have a time frame for you at this moment.
23:48:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, now I need to run off for a bit!
23:49:41 <kalbasit_> TheJollyRoger: I see. Perhaps I'll wait a bit until it's ready.
23:53:43 <Serus> kalbasit_: Another plus to that is that the phone will probably have dropped a bit in price at that point
23:56:26 <kalbasit_> Serus: yea it's a bit pricy. I'm thinking in the meantime maybe I can grab a used pixel 4 to get started
