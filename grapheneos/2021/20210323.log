00:09:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> @acegeorge we recommend users get the latest supported pixel device which right now is the 4a 5g and 5The regular 4a without 5g is an older phone with similar hardware to the 4
00:10:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> I ordered Pixel 5

00:12:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Even ethernet isn't really great either
00:13:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> Are there any particularly well anticipated changes coming in AOSP soon that will come down to Graphene OS as well?
00:15:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Sorry if this Question is obvious, but does Wi-Fi calling increase Security a (tiny) bit? (Even if it is extremly low)
00:15:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​lpha0bit> Or does it not really make any difference?
00:18:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't make any difference
00:19:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it might make quality worse if the wifi has higher latency than your mobile network
01:14:51 <Ted12> Hi. Can I use my pixel to change from the stock OS to Graphen OS without issue?
01:15:55 <zvl12[m]> Depends which model
01:21:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Ted12 "Hi. Can I use my pixel to change"> As long as OEM Unlock is not greyed out after connecting to internet
01:34:24 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> hey I got a pixel 2 and when I become a developer OEM unlocking is still grayed out. the phone is unlocked. why is this?
01:35:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Carrier unlocked is not bootloader unlockable
01:35:39 <Mastermind[m]> I ran into the same issue. The Verizon origin variants are locked tight.
01:37:29 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> so the carrier unlocked any sim will work but its Verizon origin and not google origin so thats why the OEM is stuck?
01:39:00 <Mastermind[m]> I tried the refurbished pixel 3 from Amazon twice . Total craps shoot. Returned both same issue. Got lucky with pixel 4.
01:39:32 <Mastermind[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "so the carrier unlocked any sim "> Yup
01:39:47 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I wanted to help someone get graphene on a pixel 2. I got it off eBay. it said unlocked but I guess its just carrier unlocked
01:40:11 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> so its a Verizon origin and can't have it. but a T-Mobile sim will still work In it then
01:40:53 <Mastermind[m]> Should yes, but wont take a custom OS.
01:42:08 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> how can you its unlocked for sure
01:42:40 <sphinx[m]> p8tuahpirua5ra: Make sure it's connected to internet per https://grapheneos.org/install/web#enabling-oem-unlocking
01:42:54 <Mastermind[m]> OEM unlocking won't unlock
01:52:29 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> yea its grayed out and I tried connecting it to the internet and trying and factory resetting
01:52:31 <M647509735485097> Contents of notifications flash when unlocking phone. Rather than being a generic Signal notification, I'm quickly able to see who and what they texted. Flashes for half a second
01:52:33 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> still grayed out
01:53:06 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I have another question. how can I tell if the pixel 2 is unlocked for carrier? it says its unlocked but I don't even know now if its true
01:54:54 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> i put a working t mobile sim card in it and it has am x. over where it normally gets service. is this not even unlocked?
01:54:57 <entry1[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "I have another question. how can"> Enter the phone's IMEI number on this site (required you to be logged into a Google account)
01:55:21 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> it shows LTE with the bar for signal with the x over the signal bar.
01:55:30 <entry1[m]> It will let you know if the device is a carrier variant or an unlocked device
01:55:35 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> okay
01:55:47 <entry1[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "it shows LTE with the bar for si"> Is mobile data enabled in settings?
01:56:12 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> it shows edge when inside down from the top bar
01:56:22 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> yea mobile data is on
01:57:29 <entry1[m]> Definitely check that site as the phone may not be unlocked
01:57:34 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> phone number shows unknown in settings about phone
01:57:37 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> okay
02:06:30 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> says Verizon on it sim enabled
02:06:44 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> its not even unlocked. said gsm unlocked
02:07:24 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> need to send it back then
02:09:47 <entry1[m]> Yeah. Ideally you want a 3a or higher. Pixel 2 is a legacy device
02:10:14 <sphinx[m]> 4a https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
02:11:01 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> you are right. this is for someone to test it
02:11:09 <entry1[m]> <sphinx[m] "4a https://grapheneos.org/faq#re"> Understood, but 3a has support until May 2022 and is much cheaper than a 4a if the individual is trying to purchase a Pixel 2. Understood though.
05:44:11 <Ted12> zvl12[m]: Pixel 4a.
05:44:37 <Ted12> I basically want to switch to stock OS to use some of the apps that wont work on Graphen.

08:48:44 <credixyt[m]> Hello! I've been using GrapheneOS for a while but I have an issue. I'd like to ask if it's possible to expose the location API to an app. My plan is to use a location spoofer and then somehow use that location in an app that would otherwise be using Google's location service. Any help appreciated
08:51:44 <dm3h[m]> <credixyt[m] "Hello! I've been using GrapheneO"> Interesting... I would like to please know more about this too. I tried a bunch of GPS spoofers from F-droid... on my pixel 3a running the latest version of GrapheneOS (android 11) but none of them worked... said they were made for an earlier version of android... and didn't work.
08:51:52 <dazinism> credixyt: location spoofing isn't robust
08:51:58 <Eddy[m]> BTW you don't have to use Google for weather
08:52:27 <Eddy[m]> <dazinism "credixyt: location spoofing isn'"> Vouch. Tried it during Pokémon days, it sucked
08:52:35 <dazinism> Apps can still get your location.
08:52:55 <credixyt[m]> Well. That's not really the concern. The aim is to have a working location in the app
08:52:57 <credixyt[m]> Real or not
08:53:07 <dazinism> A devious app may even pretend to fool for your spoofing, while knowing exactly where you are
08:53:35 <credixyt[m]> That's okay. I'm just looking to expose the API to the app
08:53:37 <credixyt[m]> So it can grab any location
08:53:39 <dazinism> *to be fooled by your spoofing
08:53:53 <credixyt[m]> Because currently it crashes because it the location API isn't found
08:55:44 <dazinism> Apps can access location. Not sure what you are seeing. Sounds like the app is broken
08:56:20 <credixyt[m]> Interesting. The exact error message is "API: LocationServices.API is not available on this device"
08:56:47 <dazinism> ... apps can access your location if you have granted the permission and location switched on
08:57:01 <dazinism> credixyt: is this a very old app
08:57:22 <credixyt[m]> rather recent
08:57:32 <dazinism> From Play store?
08:57:37 <credixyt[m]> Yes
08:57:40 <credixyt[m]> Using Aurora
08:58:12 <dazinism> Thats a bit weird then. Sounds like its doing something in a weird way/is broken.
08:58:49 <somenerd[m]> or maybe it's doing that on purpose
08:59:25 <somenerd[m]> This conversation is a bit offtopic. Maybe move to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
08:59:33 <credixyt[m]> Ok
09:58:15 <dazinism> The turns out LocationServices API is provided by Play Services, so not available on Graphene

13:14:59 <entry1[m]> Your best bet would to use Tor Browser if you need to use Google, but be ready for captchas and changing your exit node frequently
13:16:04 <entry1[m]> Google logs everything, so chances are your traffic can be easily correlated if you are looking up personal search results
13:16:55 <githubcrank[m]> Its just that DDG only offers 3,000 Page Articles when i ask a simple question
13:17:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Do you google sentences, or key words?
13:18:32 <githubcrank[m]> Sentences
13:18:43 <entry1[m]> Google is the best hands down, but yeah I think you just need to be specific and use different search queries with keywords
13:19:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Even google works better with key words

13:24:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> I've seen some people dislike startpage since system1 bought it
13:25:36 <pkgbuild[m]> i think this is an off-topic argument btw.
13:26:19 <githubcrank[m]> There is a reddit post that states that Startpage leaks your ip address even if you have webRTC disabled

14:46:14 <rawtaz> hi! im about to try install graphene on my pixel 4a, but have a laptop with usb-a connector. i did read the prerequisites docs, and understand that hubs are not wanted, but am wondering if a usb-a to usb-c adapter cable, coupled with the phone's usb-c to usb-c cable, would work fine? e.g. this one: https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/dator/kablar-adaptrar/usb/usb-c/usb-c-kablar/luxorparts-adapter-usb-a-till-usb-c-p69329
14:48:47 <rawtaz> i would guess that such a cable indeed has a chip in it, which can then be junk, but i would suspect a usb-a to usb-c cable which can be direct plugged into the laptop and phone to have the same type of chip, so i dont see how it would be different.

16:39:36 <strcat[m]> make sure to use the official guide / installer
16:39:59 <strcat[m]> you'll need to clarify what you've done so far and where you're having problems
16:40:08 <pallaf[m]> so there is no other way than connecting via adb?
16:40:17 <pallaf[m]> thats really cumbersome if you have grapheneos installed

17:20:57 <rawtaz> a brand new google pixel 4a. the Enable OEM Unlocking is greyed out, saying to connect to the internet or contact my carrier (which there isnt one, this phone is brand new from a non-carrier store).
17:21:28 <rawtaz> if i connect to the internet, wont that give google a ton of information they shouldnt have?
17:22:07 <rawtaz> the docs say "This requires internet access on devices with Google Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection" but im surprised this is the case for a phone that has never even been booted before
17:22:19 <engulf[m]> I would try to use public wifi for the first connection
17:22:24 <rawtaz> yeah
17:22:29 <rawtaz> that means another hour walk :D
17:22:39 <rawtaz> but thats good and healthy
17:23:23 <engulf[m]> And maybe even download the full OTA on your laptop and flash that offline rather than trying to download all of the updates over public wifi
17:24:06 <rawtaz> are you talking about google updates or graphene? i was planning on not connecting or doing anything with this phone, just installing graphene on it offline
17:24:09 <engulf[m]>  * And maybe even download the full OTA on your laptop and flash that offline rather than trying to download all of the updates over public wifi (before flashing GrapheneOS)
17:24:15 <rawtaz> mhm
17:24:25 <chmod700[m]> Hey guys, I'm attempting to flash with brave browser. It writes the boot and goes to "restarting device" and Google splash appears, and then grapheneos fastbootd shows up, but web installer hangs on "error unable to claim interface"
17:24:25 <chmod700[m]> Any ideas?
17:24:37 <rawtaz> engulf[m]: do you really think i need to install those google updates?
17:25:20 <rawtaz> unless im mistaken, what needs to work is the bootloader stuff so that graphene can be flashed, im thinking that should already be working
17:25:33 <rawtaz> (on a new phone i mean)
17:25:36 <engulf[m]> It is recommended to update the phone to the latest before flashing Grapheno OS
17:25:55 <engulf[m]>  * It is recommended to update the phone to the latest before flashing Graphene OS
17:26:10 <rawtaz> yeah. the docs say that but also "Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early in the installation process", so i figured it wasnt that important
17:26:23 <rawtaz> (on a new device - it's of course different with an old one)
17:27:34 <engulf[m]> "It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early in the installation process."

17:27:45 <githubcrank[m]> How do i become Mod?
17:28:47 <kamesjitt616[m]> Why do you want to become one
17:29:16 <rawtaz> githubcrank[m]: wherever you are thinking of, you'll be asked when it's relevant for you to become a mod
17:30:24 <engulf[m]> rawtaz: I didn't take any chances but I guess the chances that something unrecoverable will happen are pretty low
17:30:37 <rawtaz> probably
17:31:09 <engulf[m]>  * rawtaz: I didn't take any chances but I guess the odds that something unrecoverable will happen are pretty low
17:31:17 <rawtaz> god darnit, these phones and this OS sucks so hard (android). the fact that you have to ask someon idiot company for permission to unlock a phone you just bought, that's utterly pathethic and outrageous in every possible way
17:31:38 <rawtaz> this is why i *hate* android and iOS as well for that matter
17:34:25 <githubcrank[m]> If the NSA and the FBI had a hold of my phone do ya'll think they would be able to break in?
17:35:06 <rawtaz> githubcrank[m]: please, stop trolling
17:35:31 <githubcrank[m]> im not trolling
17:35:55 <githubcrank[m]> if i was i would've said more stupid stuff the moment i joined
17:36:02 <rawtaz> githubcrank[m]: the questions you ask are the type a troll would ask.
17:36:13 <rawtaz> githubcrank[m]: if you have such questions and are not trolling, please take them to #grapheneos-offtopic, thank you
17:36:33 <githubcrank[m]> i forgot i was in this channel
17:36:38 <githubcrank[m]> i must head to off-topic
17:36:43 <rawtaz> cheers
17:37:57 <githubcrank[m]> 👋
17:41:05 <rawtaz> im curious what information is sent to google and other parties when you connect a brand new pixel to the internet though
17:43:16 <strcat[m]> not about GrapheneOS
17:43:32 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't implement factory reset protection or carrier locking
17:44:11 <chmod700[m]> Hello
17:44:58 <rawtaz> thats good. too bad the original OS does it, and it makes you wonder what information you have to send to them evil idiots before you can make your device secure using GrapheneOS. kind of takes away a bit of the point of using GrapheneOS, doesnt it?
17:45:40 <strcat[m]> no, it doesn't
17:45:43 <strcat[m]> in any way
17:46:16 <strcat[m]> I suggest reading about what factory reset protection is
17:46:19 <strcat[m]> we have documentation on it
17:46:35 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to buy a phone that's already running GrapheneOS or already unlocked
17:46:46 <chmod700[m]> Web installer hangs and says "error unable to claim interface" while fastbootd screen is on phone
17:47:13 <strcat[m]> sounds like you have something else using the USB device
17:47:15 <strcat[m]> such as adb
17:47:21 <strcat[m]> perhaps from not starting with the official guide
17:47:24 <strcat[m]> reboot your computer
17:47:38 <strcat[m]> only open / use one copy of the web installer and don't run adb
17:47:53 <chmod700[m]> 10-4 will try now
17:47:56 <strcat[m]> or check if you have an adb daemon running and kill it
17:47:56 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: id love to read that documentation. but regardless, do you not agree that when you connect the phone to the internet in order to be able to enable oem unlocking, a bunch of information about your device is sent to various parties?
17:49:11 <chmod700[m]> Random side note, sometimes element posts my comment and keeps it at the bottom, never pushed message to the room it seems
17:49:22 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: no
17:49:31 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: stop with the misinformation and baseless assumptions / claims
17:49:33 <strcat[m]> next is a ban
17:49:47 <strcat[m]> stop spreading misinformation and claiming the project is pointless because of your FUD
17:50:07 <strcat[m]> not going to tolerate it today, far too much of this going on
17:50:24 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: stop accusing me of spreading misinformation when i am ASKING QUESTIONS
17:50:33 <strcat[m]> you're spreading FUD
17:50:36 <strcat[m]> continue and you're banned
17:50:54 <strcat[m]> you're making a false, baseless claim and claiming the project is pointless based on it
17:51:09 <rawtaz> are you serious? where in what i have written have i made inaccurate statements formulated in such a way as to affect others understanding of something?
17:51:25 <strcat[m]> yes, I'm serious
17:51:41 <rawtaz> if this is what you think, please educate me because i literaly have no idea what you are referring to that i have said that is FUD
17:51:46 <rawtaz> or rather, spreading FUD*
17:51:56 <rawtaz> again, i am asking questions.
17:52:10 <strcat[m]> falsely claiming that factory reset protection and the OEM unlocking toggle are some privacy violating thing
17:52:16 <strcat[m]> and falsely claiming it somehow defeats the purpose of the OS
17:52:28 <strcat[m]> and general disrespect for the rules of the channel and moderation
17:52:35 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: where did i formulate these things as *facts*?
17:52:47 <strcat[m]> above
17:52:47 <rawtaz> what? where did i ever disrespect any of those things?
17:52:54 <strcat[m]> right now
17:52:56 <rawtaz> how?
17:53:08 <strcat[m]> you're doing it literally right now
17:53:34 <chmod700[m]> Fawk, same problem, and double checked no adb running elsewhere
17:53:35 <rawtaz> how? i asm asking you to clarify what you say so that i understand, and you are calling this disrespecting the rules of the channel and moderation?
17:53:55 <strcat[m]> yes, it is
17:54:13 <githubcrank[m]> strcat ur dumb
17:54:22 <kamesjitt616[m]> <chmod700[m] "Random side note, sometimes elem"> Clear cache in settings
17:54:25 <chmod700[m]> I am using brave browser, chromium based. Perhaps that is the issue?
17:54:28 <rawtaz> *how*? you are being unclear as heck man. im not trying to question you, but you are saying something without actually explaining in what way this would be.
17:55:30 <kamesjitt616[m]> <githubcrank[m] "strcat ur dumb"> Do you even know who he is
17:56:20 <kamesjitt616[m]> Ah he's banned good call
17:56:59 <entry1[m]> I knew he was a troll from the beginning. This is getting so bad recently, including earlier today. Thank you strcat for remaining unfazed and helpful.
17:57:21 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: i scrolled up and read what i had written about data being sent to google etc, and there's nothing in there being spreading fud - if you *read* what i wrote, i was *asking*. please show me what quote you are thinking of when you say im spreading FUD, because i simply cannot find it above, after trying.
17:58:02 <strcat> rawtaz: misrepresenting what the OEM unlocking toggle does
17:58:10 <strcat> rawtaz: misrepresenting it as some awful thing that somehow ruins the point of GrapheneOS
17:58:24 <strcat> rawtaz: and now you're just arguing against channel rules being enforced
17:58:56 <strcat> the channel is being consistently raided by trolls, throughout each day, and people who act badly are going to be banned with them
17:59:10 <strcat> there is no way for me to differentiate between people doing this maliciously or for other reasons
18:00:19 <rawtaz> strcat: if you were to listen to what i tell you perhaps you'd see that im not actually trying to troll or question. or waste your time for that matter. but it's hard to get a clear picture when you repeatedly dont just show me what quote you are referring to. cant you just copy paste what you reacted to so i can see exactly what you mean? thats what ive been asking all along.
18:00:35 <rawtaz> you dont have to jump the gun on everyone just because there's idiots out there
18:00:46 <rawtaz> i know very well what you mean by there being trolls
18:01:11 <strcat> I've had enough of concern trolling
18:01:16 <strcat> I'm not doing that for you
18:01:49 <rawtaz> this is fo extremely unfair.
18:01:51 <rawtaz> so*
18:02:02 <strcat> I haven't banned you
18:02:06 <strcat> I'm asking you to stop doing something
18:02:14 <poisonoushydra[m> Maybe the comments that were deleted by moderators might be a clue?
18:02:18 <strcat> githubcrank has been trolling and wasting people's time for an hour
18:02:29 <strcat> and was likely the person earlier harassing me
18:02:37 <strcat> they just cycle through Matrix accounts all day
18:02:41 <strcat> no life
18:03:26 <strcat> rawtaz: there is nothing about OEM unlocking that ruins the point of GrapheneOS, and I've had enough of people doing that BS concern trolling
18:03:28 <rawtaz> strcat: does it not make sense to you that if you want someone to behave a different way (or stop doing something), you have to point to what they wrote that you didnt like? you are not clearly answering the (very simple) i ask you for clarification, and thats why i kept asking you what you are actually referring to.
18:03:37 <strcat> attention seeking by shitting on the project with FUD to get answers is not acceptable
18:03:41 <strcat> it will lead to quick bans
18:04:12 <rawtaz> poisonoushydra[m: im not sure i see comments being deleted the same way as you do, as im on the IRC (you seem to be on the matrix)
18:04:35 <rawtaz> strcat: okay wait. are you suggesting im seeking attention, too?
18:05:00 <poisonoushydra[m> rawtaz: Check the channel logs at https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos.
18:05:10 <strcat> I'm stating, as a moderator of the channel, that it is against the rules to stick hyperbole / nonsense into your questions in an attempt to get people to answer
18:05:31 <strcat> you want to ask about something? just ask, without the FUD
18:05:33 <strcat> thanks
18:06:03 <iknowlessthanjon> good evening can somebody please tell me what damage somebody with physical access to the a device running graphene OS can do? Is it possible to sideload malicious code?
18:06:19 <strcat> no, please read the documentation
18:06:24 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
18:06:29 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
18:06:33 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
18:07:16 <strcat> rawtaz: any time someone is doing the whole 'minor annoyance / irritation -> the whole project is pointless' routine it is going to lead to moderation
18:07:19 <strcat> concern trolling
18:07:47 <ryanrambharose[m> Can i install graphene os without a pc?
18:08:48 <zzxx123_> You can do web install from a phone
18:09:15 <rawtaz> strcat: im not sure you understand that i was actually genuinely asking a question. how can you not see that "doesnt X take away A BIT OF the point of Y ?" is a question and not an attempt to spread fud? with all due respect, i think you need to realize that not everyone is trying to troll. it was a genuine question, thats a fact.
18:09:41 <iknowlessthanjon> <strcat "no, please read the documentatio"> I did read the whole documentation but with my basic understanding I was not sure if an apk could be sideloaded or not. I understand that an update would have to be signed with the proper key but I wasn't sure if there is any way to write a binary or sideload an app to the device with physical access...
18:09:54 <rawtaz> strcat: and as i said earlier, me asking to understand what you are referring to is not me *questioning* you or your moderator status or the channel. i am merely yrying to understand where you're coming from, so that i can adapt. alright?
18:10:00 <rawtaz> that said im off to a meeting.
18:10:06 <ryanrambharose[m> <zzxx123_ "You can do web install from a ph"> Can you send a link

18:18:03 <zzxx123_> ryanrambharose[m if you mean just the Pixel, no. You need another phone.
18:18:40 <neo[m]1> can you install graphene on anything other than a pixel?
18:19:07 <zzxx123_> Nope
18:19:12 <ryanrambharose[m> Thanks
18:19:37 <strcat[m]> you can do the install from another phone
18:19:41 <strcat[m]> but you need another device to install from
18:19:42 <iknowlessthanjon> yes you can
18:20:31 <klarkkable[m]> <iknowlessthanjon "I did read the whole documentati"> sideloading protections are handled by the recovery which prevents replacing the OS, downgrading, etc from non-verified sources. You wouldn't be able to sideload an app/binary via recovery.

20:32:54 <Keith89> Hi there. I just got a Pixel 4a and I'm trying to install GrapheneOS on it. I'm on the install page (web version). There's a step that I don't understand. Could anyone help me understand what I'm supposed to do in order to get Windows to recognize my phone? https://grapheneos.org/install/web#booting-into-the-bootloader-interface
20:34:18 <iknowlessthanjon> you need to press ALT+F4
20:35:21 <iknowlessthanjon> if that doesn't work press the windows key type CMD - press enter - then type: format c: /fs:ntfs    and press enter again
20:35:35 <Keith89> You're not being helpful
20:35:45 <iknowlessthanjon> true
20:35:57 <Keith89> I figured it out anyway.
20:36:15 <iknowlessthanjon> but can you imagine how amazing it feels when some idiot actually falls for it :D
20:36:23 <Keith89> lol
20:36:32 <iknowlessthanjon> trollgasm
20:36:51 <bante[m]> Hi, also bruh
20:37:32 <bante[m]> Do you really need to stoop to these "troll" levels. You're going to wipe some poor souls pc that just wanted pointers and help
20:37:57 <iknowlessthanjon> well... if that poor soul uses windows... :D
20:38:12 <iknowlessthanjon> maybe he uses the chance to finally switch to linux :D
20:38:28 <bante[m]> Thinking is not for everyone
20:38:47 <bante[m]> If they have enough security enabled and dont do stupid stuff on windows let them be
20:39:28 <Keith89> I've tried to switch to Linux multiple times but the interface and window management has always been mediocre at best. That being said, if it got better I would seriously consider switching.
20:39:50 <iknowlessthanjon> which distros did you try?
20:40:18 <Keith89> Ubuntu, Mint (Mate, I think), maybe one other...
20:40:44 <iknowlessthanjon> Can't say much bad about Ubuntu 20.10
20:40:47 <bante[m]> Linux is fun but I dont like how everyone bickers over useless stuff and doesnt come together to actually fix things. There are some literal communists that go back on their morals as soon as big companies get involved
20:40:55 <bante[m]> Also the security model is awful
20:41:25 <Keith89> Really? I always understood security to be superior on Linux.
20:41:25 <iknowlessthanjon> I guess that depends on the threat level
20:41:26 <bante[m]> Besides that it can be fun, you can do vm to other oses for everything else
20:41:44 <bante[m]> Everything is connected and hacked together
20:42:02 <bante[m]> Theres a reason everyone is switching to virtualization nowdays
20:42:04 <iknowlessthanjon> I disagree
20:42:14 <bante[m]> I like linux but it all feels so bloated nowadays
20:42:20 <bante[m]> How come
20:42:57 <bante[m]> If you wanna go down to it the whole x86_64 architecture is bloated imo 😅
20:43:15 <princemachiavell> Probably should move android vs Linux to off topic channel.
20:43:38 <iknowlessthanjon> it's win vs lin not and vs lin but yes it's ot
20:44:15 <bante[m]> I guess, just registered so i dont know much yet but as a final note:
20:44:21 <iknowlessthanjon> you get 5 mod-gestapo stars be proud of yourself!
20:44:46 <bante[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/index.html - i mostly(not filly) agree with this guy
20:44:57 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> <iknowlessthanjon "I guess that depends on the thre"> true
20:45:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> test
20:46:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> test
20:47:21 <madaidan[m]> <bante[m] "https://madaidans-insecurities.g"> I agree with that guy too
20:48:11 <grapheneos_user_> <madaidan[m] "I agree with that guy too"> IDK he seems like a corporate shill
20:48:54 <bante[m]> Makes sense to me. There are new threat levels and imo nowadays we have enough processing power to not mind the performance drop of virtualization
20:49:12 <bante[m]> And since most of the stuff ever coded was coded in C sandboxing is a must atm
20:49:26 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "IDK he seems like a corporate sh"> he sells out to Microsoft, loves proprietary software, and hates open-source
20:49:56 <bante[m]> From his perspective i can see why dude
20:49:59 <Keith89> After I flashed the factory image I get an error "Error: Unable to claim interface". I can't progress to the next step: Locking the bootloader. Any ideas?
20:50:29 <bante[m]> From what i've read he gets shit on every time he tries to talk about his ideas to open source community
20:51:06 <grapheneos_user_> <bante[m] "From what i've read he gets shit"> But you don't need sandboxing, sandboxing bash is a nightmare dewd
20:51:19 <bante[m]> And the response usually is "no screw you, we only need to read the code to see if its good - we dont need preventive measures and security"
20:52:11 <bante[m]> I mean why sandbox bash? I agree with sandboxing a program but a 100 line script is something you can read by yourself
20:52:15 <iknowlessthanjon> he's recommending signal :D
20:52:24 <bante[m]> I said mostly agree lul
20:52:32 <grapheneos_user_> <bante[m] "I mean why sandbox bash? I agree"> I took the joke too far
20:52:36 <grapheneos_user_> Sorry
20:52:43 <bante[m]> Matrix seems kinda suspect too, at least element
20:52:46 <grapheneos_user_> I was repeating something someone said to him
20:53:09 <bante[m]> I'm betting my money on session,  hopefully they manage to make it work
20:53:19 <iknowlessthanjon> I only use smoke signs for long distance communication
20:53:21 <bante[m]> Oh ok lol sorry im dense sometimes
20:53:25 <bante[m]> Same dude
20:53:30 <iknowlessthanjon> session is shit

20:55:15 <iknowlessthanjon> pure p2p is the only acceptable way imho - the idiots at briar are too dumb to create a proper messenger but the concept is good
20:55:44 <iknowlessthanjon> else i think one could make xmpp via hidden services work
20:56:02 <iknowlessthanjon> so every user runs his own xmpp server as a hidden service
20:56:17 <iknowlessthanjon>  * else i think one could make federated xmpp via hidden services work
20:56:17 <grapheneos_user_> should be in off topic channel
20:56:21 <bante[m]> Imo i want something like (dont crucify me yet) macos but with mostly open source software and secure base with concrete seperation of userspace and systemspace. but without systemd 😂 i dunno its all a mess
20:56:34 <bante[m]> How many rooms are there? Just this one and offtopic?
20:58:08 <bante[m]> Anyway thx for creating grapheneos, hopefully I'll be able to get a pixel soon and join you guys. Keep up the good work ✌🏻
21:00:05 <entry1[m]> <bante[m] "How many rooms are there? Just t"> Aside from beta testing, that's correct. Hope to see you join the GrapeneOS community
21:00:29 <iknowlessthanjon> just use a virtual phone
21:02:16 <bante[m]> Haha yeah i guess thats an option

21:06:53 <grapheneos_user_> <madaidan[m] "He's joking. I am the guy in men"> yes
21:07:04 <Keith89> Got it installed. That was pretty easy. My issues stemmed from other USB devices. Once I removed everything except the Pixel it work flawlessly.
21:09:57 <Keith89> Will it show the message "Your device is loading a different operating system" every time I restart it?
21:10:12 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "Will it show the message "Your d"> yes
21:10:23 <iknowlessthanjon> @maidadan you're full of shit
21:10:26 <Keith89> Thanks
21:10:34 <iknowlessthanjon>  * @madaidan you're full of shit
21:10:49 <iknowlessthanjon>  * madaidan. you're full of shit
21:10:57 <iknowlessthanjon>  * @madaidan. you're full of shit
21:11:13 <grapheneos_user_> Keith89: It does that whenever the key flashed to the Titan M is different from the hardware key
21:11:21 <madaidan[m]> <iknowlessthanjon "@maidadan you're full of shit"> Thanks
21:11:37 <grapheneos_user_> <iknowlessthanjon "@maidadan you're full of shit"> Aren't we all
21:11:39 <iknowlessthanjon> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/vpns.html
21:11:43 <iknowlessthanjon> can't stop laughing
21:12:02 <Keith89> So it's nothing to worry about?
21:12:03 <madaidan[m]> The one thing I am always grateful for is the welcoming open source community
21:12:08 <grapheneos_user_> Keith89: yes
21:12:21 <grapheneos_user_> <madaidan[m] "The one thing I am always gratef"> Fuck you shill
21:12:36 <grapheneos_user_> Priprietary software is a blackbox
21:12:59 <grapheneos_user_> Actually the joke has been taken way too far now
21:13:52 <Keith89> Is it important to verify the installation?
21:13:53 <iknowlessthanjon> <madaidan[m] "The one thing I am always gratef"> this has nothing to do with the OS community
21:14:19 <iknowlessthanjon> you're just trying to shit on everything and bring very one-sided arguments...
21:14:21 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "Is it important to verify the in"> You mean with Auditor? Yes
21:14:26 <iknowlessthanjon> ignoring many other important factors

21:15:33 <M12punch[m]> I just got a pixel w graphene already installed. Is it possible to get a SIM card from an LG phone to work in the Pixel?
21:15:33 <M12punch[m]> I tried putting it in and it recognized the phone number but didn't get service.
21:15:35 <iknowlessthanjon> "Many VPNs have lied about their no logging polices before" a VPN can't lie... a VPN provider can

21:15:57 <iknowlessthanjon> it should work with any simcard
21:16:29 <poisonoushydra[m> 12punch: Check APN settings?
21:16:30 <iknowlessthanjon>  * it should work with any simcard did you try to activate mobile networks?

21:16:42 <grayhatter> I don't know, I've had vpns tell me they were connected before
21:16:59 <madaidan[m]> Anyway, go to OT if you want to shit on me more.
21:17:12 <M12punch[m]> APN settings...I don't think I checked that.
21:17:44 <bante[m]> Im hoping something comes out of Sentinel project and the dVPN meme :^) otherwise I'll just host my own vpn
21:18:00 <Keith89> I ran the Auditor. I'm assuming this means everything is good? "Successfully performed basic initial verification and pairing."
21:19:08 <iknowlessthanjon> <bante[m] "Im hoping something comes out of"> selfhosting ftw
21:19:24 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "I ran the Auditor. I'm assuming "> There may be an option to do more than that, maybe under "extended" something
21:19:31 <grapheneos_user_> Just in case
21:23:07 <Keith89> I'm not seeing any advanced or extended verification options. I think that's all there is.
21:23:16 <Keith89> Thanks for the help! I think I'm good to go.
21:23:22 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "I'm not seeing any advanced or e"> Then you're fine
21:23:33 <grapheneos_user_> Welcome aboard the ship!
21:23:45 <Keith89> Thanks!
21:24:04 <Keith89> I've got an old Pixel 2. It's not supported on GrapheneOS, is it?
21:24:28 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "I've got an old Pixel 2. It's no"> There are images but it won't be updated anymore
21:25:05 <Keith89> In terms of security, does that mean I should stick with stock Android? Or would Graphene still be more secure at this point?
21:25:27 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "In terms of security, does that "> Graphene is more secure
21:25:34 <grapheneos_user_> But neither receive any more updates
21:26:46 <Keith89> Right, I saw that Google stopped supporting it. Great. I'll give it a try on the Pixel 2 as well. Can I use the Web Installer for that one too?
21:27:10 <grapheneos_user_> <Keith89 "Right, I saw that Google stopped"> Think the web installer is phone-agnostic, but I haven't used it yet
21:27:35 <Keith89> Ok, thanks for all the info. I appreciate it.
21:32:21 <nscnt[m]> Keith89: If you want a genuinely secure device, you should try to upgrade to a newer phone as soon as possible
21:33:12 <Keith89> I agree. I'm just having a hard time justifying $500-$700 when my Pixel 2 is still working really well (except for security updates, obviously).
21:33:53 <iknowlessthanjon> take a pixel 4a
21:34:09 <iknowlessthanjon> they should be fair priced
21:36:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> dot (@i​dontselldrugsorguns) has joined the Telegram Group!
21:36:33 <Keith89> Yeah, my boss just had me purchase a 4a for testing GrapheneOS. It was $350. The fit and finish are amazing. It feels great in the hand. It's better than my Pixel 2. But for my personal device I would get a version that supports 5G so it more future proof.
21:37:04 <iknowlessthanjon> what would you need 5g for? LD
21:37:05 <iknowlessthanjon>  * what would you need 5g for?
21:37:22 <iknowlessthanjon> are there any plans to shut down 4g in the next 5 years in your country?
21:37:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> >Yeah, my boss just had me purchase a 4a for testing GrapheneOS.
21:37:48 <hypokeimenon[m]> Mind if I ask why>
21:37:57 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * Mind if I ask why?
21:38:00 <bante[m]> 5G is a meme
21:38:08 <bante[m]> I unfortunately fell for it too
21:38:54 <Keith89> We're testing our app on the OS. It's not ready for prime-time so I can't really share about it yet.
21:39:26 <Keith89> We expect that it may be eventually get pulled from the App Store and Play Store so we're preparing for alternatives.
21:39:28 <iknowlessthanjon> Keith is that you? I told you not to talk about the app with anyone yet!
21:39:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> Is it privacy/security related?
21:39:42 <iknowlessthanjon> you don't need to come to work again tomorrow!
21:39:46 <Keith89> :)
21:40:17 <hypokeimenon[m]>  Cool, good luck anyways.
21:40:36 <Keith89> Thanks
21:41:00 <Keith89> Hey, does GrapheneOS support swipe left to go back?

21:46:40 <QuangNguyen[m]> hello GrapheneOS group..  my pixel was recently affected by next level spyware and i believe my bootloader was affected. Is there a fix as i'm hoping to install GrapheneOS cleanly
21:47:19 <iknowlessthanjon> <QuangNguyen[m] "hello GrapheneOS group..  my pix"> did you cover the phone in tinfoil?
21:48:02 <QuangNguyen[m]> by spyware, i called it 'next level' because one of my neighbours who shares the internet at the property we rent, was under police surveillance and then arrested recently for distributing a large amount of drugs, 100kgs interstate to be exact
21:48:31 <princemachiavell> Exhibit A right here sir.
21:48:31 <QuangNguyen[m]> so no, i didn't cover it in tinfoil
21:48:45 <akc3n[m]> <QuangNguyen[m] "hello GrapheneOS group..  my pix"> What does next level spyware mean? And what's wrong with following the guide on grapheneos for " clean " install.
21:50:15 <QuangNguyen[m]> when your government decides to put someone on surveillance, that crap infects everything from our routers, to cell towers in the spot i live. i've tried several times to follow the guide and can't avoid being hijacked
21:50:24 <akc3n[m]> No body cares about your stupid drugs or exact interstate amount., people care more about the destruction of families and their communities.
21:50:24 <QuangNguyen[m]> its messing with the install
21:51:04 <QuangNguyen[m]> noone has to care, i'm asking someone with a clue for help
21:51:55 <iknowlessthanjon> <3
21:52:10 <QuangNguyen[m]> pls..
21:52:21 <princemachiavell> Rule number one. Don't get high on your own supply.
21:52:21 <QuangNguyen[m]> don't respond again
21:52:26 <princemachiavell> Post the error.
21:52:52 <iknowlessthanjon> the chances that your bootloader was modified remotely are below 0.000005%
21:53:06 <QuangNguyen[m]> princemachiavelli: true
21:53:33 <iknowlessthanjon> if someone had physical access to it then the chances are >0.000005% but still not great...

22:03:00 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: did you write a lot of the install and releases instructions on the website?
22:06:27 <strcat[m]> yes
22:06:52 <strcat[m]> I wrote 95% of the content on the website
22:06:59 <rawtaz> i can tell :-) (in a good way, if that isn't obvious)
22:07:15 <rawtaz> nice. thanks for that. these instructions are truly top-notch!
22:07:56 <rawtaz> it does seem to me like there's some deploy mechanism in place such that version numbers are automatically updated in these docs, but perhaps im mistaken? e.g. you have the right hash and version for the platform tools download
22:09:26 <afk222_> Hey I have a few questions regarding the disk encryption on grapheneos
22:10:02 <rawtaz> shoot
22:10:13 <afk222_> What passwords do you need to enter when booting the devices and getting to the normal grapheneos dashboard
22:10:36 <rawtaz> you mean when you have disk encryption enabled i presume?
22:10:38 <afk222_> Are there multiple? I.e a boot password and then a normal android pattern password
22:10:39 <afk222_> Yes
22:12:23 <rawtaz> im installing graphene for the first time in about two minutes from now so ill have to defer
22:12:27 <poisonoushydra[m> iknowlessthanjonsnow: Is calling people "retarded" and encouraging them to commit suicide in the OffTopic channel.
22:12:41 <afk222_> Oh okay.
22:12:57 <rawtaz> afk222_: stay tuned :)
22:13:15 <iknowlessthanjon> <poisonoushydra[m "iknowlessthanjonsnow: Is calling"> you're fake news
22:13:48 <rawtaz> question: what would be a good place to see the changelog or similar for what changed between the latest stable release and the latest beta, for a model (e.g. pixel 4a)?
22:14:12 <nscnt[m]> How about... the changelog?
22:14:22 <nscnt[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
22:15:49 <rawtaz> nscnt[m]: well correct me if im wrong but it looks to me like the changelog there is for stable releases, not what changed since then and is in the beta?
22:15:55 <nscnt[m]> Releases go: internal testing > beta channel > stable channel
22:16:12 <nscnt[m]> so beta and stable will be the same at some point
22:16:35 <rawtaz> yeah, obviously. but im asking about seeing what changed between the last stable and the current beta.
22:18:04 <rawtaz> (in case itäs possible in some easier to digest way than checking commit messages in various repos, that is :)
22:19:07 <nscnt[m]> read what I wrote
22:19:14 <nscnt[m]> beta and stable is the same currently
22:19:50 <rawtaz> okay, i see what you mean by that.
22:19:52 <nscnt[m]> the changelog lists all changes that has been introduced from the latest release (doesn't matter whether it's still in beta or already in stable)
22:20:35 <rawtaz> i didnt look at the version numbers for the beta, i presumed that like in most projects work is ongoing in parallel even when there's a release being made.
22:20:41 <rawtaz> gotcha
22:20:49 <rawtaz> thanks for clarifying this
22:24:00 <afk222_> Was anyone able to answer?
22:24:22 <afk222_> How many passwords are required to enter to reach the normal grapheneOS dashboard when disk encryption is enabled?
22:24:43 <dazinism> afk222_: its standard Pixel file based encryption
22:24:56 <nscnt[m]> it's enabled by default
22:25:03 <dazinism> Since Pixel 3 its backed by Titan
22:25:07 <dazinism> Security chip
22:25:34 <dazinism> Boots to system. Then enter password to load user data
22:25:44 <nscnt[m]> afk222_: 1, the primary authenticator you chose
22:26:19 <afk222_> I see and how does grapeheneOS fair to brute force attacks
22:26:40 <nscnt[m]> afk222_: Please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
22:26:46 <afk222_> Thanks!
22:28:05 <afk222_> Another quick question. Is there any noticeable performance difference when using grapheneOS with a Pixel 5 rather than a Pixel 4a
22:28:36 <afk222_> Also is it possible to employ a Tor transport proxy and VPN where all traffic is routed through Tor and a VPN
22:30:31 <Keith89> I just installed GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a. My daily driver has been a Pixel 2. In my experience the Pixel 4a has more polish and better feel. But they are both snappy with Android. The 4a is fantastic with GrapheneOS. I'm sure the 5 would be great too.
22:31:14 * rawtaz is happy to hear that as he will now boot GOS for the first time on a 4a
22:32:10 <rawtaz> question: can someone verify that when you arrive at step https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#post-installation , you can disconnect the phone from the computer?
22:32:26 <dazinism> Don't think most people would notice much difference. Think the Pixel 3a is only one that would stand out due to slower memory
22:32:41 <dazinism> rawtaz: once you lock the bootloader you are good
22:32:46 <strcat> rawtaz: once you've locked it, you're done
22:33:09 <strcat> also it's harmless to stop the flashing procedure at any point, you can pull out the USB cable at any point during installation, even when flashing firmware, and it's fine, you can just restart the process
22:33:21 <strcat> because the way it works is that it sends over all the data for an image, and then tells it to flash, then continues on
22:34:57 <rawtaz> strcat: dazinism: figured as much. im thinking one should add something like "You may also disconnect the phone from the computer at any time." as the last sentence in that section (to make it complete the step at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#connecting-phone )
22:35:27 <rawtaz> this would avoid any uncertainty on that point, even though most people probably assume what you verified
22:41:58 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: well, most people would panic about not having an OS fully installed
22:42:03 <strcat[m]> so it's not generally advisable
22:42:06 <strcat[m]> but it's safe
22:45:03 <rawtaz> sorry, im not following. at that part of the process, post-install, the os is fully installed so why would they panic if they read that the installation is complete and they can boot graphene now (and as per my suggestion that they may also disconnect the phone)?
22:47:00 <rawtaz> im not suggesting adding it before that - only when the process is complete
22:56:38 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: ah well we can tell people they can disconnect after locking
22:56:44 <strcat[m]> locking being completed is when it's finished
22:58:15 <rawtaz> yeah that might be a better place for it
23:20:07 * rawtaz noticed that the list of Default alarm sound hsa "Platinum" listed twice
23:20:37 <rawtaz> Cesium too
