00:04:40 <Pratyush[m]> there is no such issue reported afaik,
00:05:39 <Pratyush[m]> make use of auditor instead of re flashing the os.

01:19:24 <SlavWolf> Pratyush[m] for Auditor I need another Android device
01:19:48 <SlavWolf> I tried flashing previous version, same bug
01:20:15 <SlavWolf> I even tried MyLocalAccount and added contacts there instead of "Device" as a storage
01:20:26 <SlavWolf> no app see my contacts
01:21:22 <SlavWolf> does flash-all override all things from stock or some things remain?
01:40:26 <SlavWolf> well, I'll try web installer for a change
01:53:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> surfhard (@s​urfhard) has joined the Telegram Group!
02:08:32 <SlavWolf> nope, not working
02:15:27 <SlavWolf> Pratyush[m] managed to find old Android phone, Auditor shows some info after scanning QR codes that look perfectly normal
02:34:19 <mrjenkins> hey all
02:34:32 <mrjenkins> I have a question about grapheneos installation on a OnePlus 7 GM1900
02:34:45 <mrjenkins> how feasible is it
02:34:59 <mrjenkins> given adequate know-how with command-line consoles and building from source
02:35:09 <strcat[m]> you would need to port and maintain it
02:35:24 <mrjenkins> understood
02:35:41 <mrjenkins> in terms of shorter-term alternatives with similar security features, what would you recommend for this device
02:35:52 <mrjenkins> (longer term goal is to switch to a pixel phone
02:35:55 <mrjenkins> )
02:36:38 <mrjenkins> Is lineageos even close to up-to-par in terms of privacy consciousness, with additional tweaks to the kernel and so on?
02:36:46 <mrjenkins> (I am thinking kirasakura kernel on top)
02:39:50 <mrjenkins> thanks strcat I might start with that for the time being until there is a better solution available
02:40:06 <mrjenkins> gg, peace out yall talk to you very soon
02:40:06 <strcat[m]> no
02:40:10 <strcat[m]> there's nothing comparable to use
02:40:24 <strcat[m]> and trusting a bunch of sketchy projects isn't going to make it better
02:40:27 <mrjenkins> I figured, it's pure panacea
02:40:30 <mrjenkins> alas
02:40:46 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS ported to it wouldn't really be GrapheneOS
02:40:55 <strcat[m]> there ARE devices other than Pixels where it could be okay
02:40:59 <strcat[m]> but probably not OnePlus devices
02:49:25 <SlavWolf> figured it out ._.
02:49:48 <SlavWolf> when I was filling contacts I did it without country code
02:50:26 <SlavWolf> since I was cleaning up my contacts I rewrote necessary numbers to new phone instead of exporting vcf like usual
02:50:50 <taabcndefodvgkry> Awesome!
02:50:58 <SlavWolf> and looks like iPhone contacts app adds country code by default
02:51:03 <SlavWolf> but AOSP Contacts not
02:53:14 <SlavWolf> guess I can throw iPhone back to drawer and enjoy normal system
03:26:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Hello all, GrapheneOS needs testers. If you can test, maybe spare even a few minutes, please message anupritaisno1 so he can give you further instructions.
03:48:31 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: Where is it on the website?
04:01:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: message anupritaisno1
04:02:00 <dnull> ...
04:02:03 <dnull> Ok
06:00:23 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I want to swap my back and window buttons. I was reading one way to do that is to turn on developer mode, plug my phone into my computer, and run a console command. Is this required or can I just install one of the console apps from f-droid and run the command line there?
06:00:39 <strcat[m]> it's not supported
06:00:54 <strcat[m]> recommend switching to gesture mode
06:01:16 <Foxtrek_64[m]> It started on gesture mode and it was not a good experience.
06:01:28 <strcat[m]> the default isn't gesture mode
06:01:38 <strcat[m]> 2 button mode is not gesture mode
06:01:54 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Either way, putting it on three button mode was the first thing I did when I got my phone set up.
06:04:46 <strcat[m]> if you use gesture mode, you just swipe left on the bottom to go to the last app
06:04:57 <strcat[m]> don't need to use recent apps at all
06:05:14 <strcat[m]> but it's a nicer experience either way
06:05:41 <strcat[m]> and back is just a gesture too
06:05:49 <strcat[m]> that's the only supported option on the stock OS now
06:06:13 <strcat[m]> we'll likely switch the default too, would have already, just don't want to change it for existing installs which complicates it
06:06:35 <strcat[m]> aware that 2 and 3 button mode are not particularly good experiences compared to the modern way
06:07:00 <strcat[m]> it's hard to change the default only for new installs, requires a multi-step approach
06:09:23 <strcat[m]> low priority for us too
06:09:28 <strcat[m]> but we recommend using gesture mode and getting used to it
06:09:34 <strcat[m]> it's pretty much objectively better in every way
06:09:40 <strcat[m]> more screen real estate, less effort to do anything
06:10:08 <strcat[m]> legacy apps might have somewhat conflicting gestures (using the wrong swipe direction to open side menu) but it works fine anyways
06:10:36 <strcat[m]> we kept around the legacy ones but stock OS didn't and they don't get the same attention + won't
06:10:42 <strcat[m]> definitely not from us
06:11:08 <strcat[m]> maybe we should just change the default in the next release and to get it over with
06:20:53 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Reading here that it's part of the System UI apk - explains why changing the order was just an option in the settings menu in the stock OS.
06:22:47 <strcat[m]> the stock OS doesn't have that option
06:22:58 <strcat[m]> and doesn't have the legacy modes on newer devices
06:23:44 <Foxtrek_64[m]> It's there on my Galaxy and I thought I saw it on whatever Google's flavor of Android was but I'm not quite sure now.
06:24:03 <strcat[m]> a Samsung phone doesn't run the same OS as a Pixel
06:24:07 <strcat[m]> it doesn't run Google Android
06:24:09 <strcat[m]> only Pixels do
06:24:32 <strcat[m]> the stock OS on Pixels on the current generation devices only has gesture mode
06:24:37 <strcat[m]> the other modes are legacy, they are gone
06:24:49 <strcat[m]> they're only available on devices that launched before gesture mode, for Google Android
06:25:03 <strcat[m]> we go out of the way to keep them available and we don't default to the same thing as the stock OS
06:25:06 <strcat[m]> I explained above
06:25:13 <strcat[m]> gesture mode is what's recommended and what will be the default in the future
06:25:21 <strcat[m]> aside from familiarity the other modes don't really have any advantages
06:25:33 <strcat[m]> waste screen real estate, make everything take longer
06:25:48 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I see
06:26:15 <strcat[m]> we've just been reluctant to change the UI mode for existing users who don't have a user configured setting applied
06:26:21 <strcat[m]> will cause drama
06:26:33 <strcat[m]> we want to use gesture mode by default for new installs
06:26:46 <strcat[m]> if we just change the default it will change for anyone who never configured it manually
06:26:48 <strcat[m]> maybe that's fine
06:27:42 <strcat[m]> gesture mode has a more modern recent apps screen and you can just cycle through them via swipe left (go back) and right (go forward, but the active app always becomes the right-most one, and each step left is a step back in history)
06:27:47 <strcat[m]> and back is a gesture
06:29:00 <strcat[m]> swipe up is home, swipe up and hold is overview (but you don't really need that, can just swipe left / right without opening it)
06:29:18 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Honestly I hardly ever use the window mode anyways. I only use the back and home buttons, and muscle memory has trained me to know the back button is on the right. So naturally I hit that and open the window mode.
06:29:18 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Only time I really use the window mode is when I need to close an app. Otherwise I usually just go to my home screen and tap the app icon again.
06:29:34 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Gesture mode doesn't really work well with the way I use my phone.
06:29:58 <strcat[m]> gesture mode isn't what you were using
06:30:09 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Nah, I'm using 3 button mode
06:30:12 <strcat[m]> the default is 2 button mode (back, home, swipe up for overview)
06:30:15 <strcat[m]> on GrapheneOS
06:30:17 <strcat[m]> not on the stock OS
06:30:21 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Yeah
06:30:25 <strcat[m]> yeah that's not gesture mode
06:30:39 <strcat[m]> gesture mode has no buttons
06:30:40 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Right, I'm just saying that gesture mode isn't the right solution for me.
06:30:52 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I want three button mode but I want the back and window buttons swapped.
06:30:52 <strcat[m]> it's probably going to become the only option
06:31:35 <strcat[m]> probably should just change the default and stop delaying it or worrying about preserving old default for past installs
06:31:42 <strcat[m]> people can always switch back
06:34:22 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Hrm... asking settings for the current state of the secure sysui_nav_bar variable returns null. Trying to set it to `space,recent;home;back,space` tells me that home and back are inaccessible are not found.
06:34:22 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Put it back to null for now, but it loos like when you said unsupported you also meant it doesn't work period, not just that you can't help me if I do it and something breaks.
06:34:42 <Foxtrek_64[m]>  * Hrm... asking settings for the current state of the secure sysui_nav_bar variable returns null. Trying to set it to `space,recent;home;back,space` tells me that home and back are inaccessible are not found.
06:34:43 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Put it back to null for now, but it looks like when you said unsupported you also meant it doesn't work period, not just that you can't help me if I do it and something breaks.
06:34:45 <strcat[m]> it doesn't do anything
06:34:51 <catfish[m]> My problem with gesture mode is it stops the gesture behaviour in Vanadium. In the browser I can swipe forward and backward through history. In full gesture mode this seems to be overwritten.
06:36:34 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Am I just SOL then? I also tried installing an app that uses the accessibility API to give me a navbar that I could customize but it's unable to draw over the system UI and a lot of times it would disappear even though I'd set it not to.
06:38:10 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I've read enforcing RTL mode will do what I'm looking for with the navbar but it'll also change a bunch of other things that I don't want changed, so that's sort of a false option.
06:38:21 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend against using accessibility services or device managers
06:38:27 <strcat[m]> you should really just switch to gesture mode and get used to it
06:38:47 <strcat[m]> quicker to do every action and more screen real estate for apps
06:38:53 <strcat[m]> the older options are going away
06:38:56 <strcat[m]> you have to move sooner or later
06:39:19 <strcat[m]> we will not be adding back legacy navigation options and maintaining them when they're gone
06:39:22 <strcat[m]> it's not what we do in GrapheneOS
06:39:54 <strcat[m]> the stock OS only has gesture navigation now
06:40:08 <strcat[m]> we generally don't like deviating from it and enabling unsupported / legacy things
06:42:21 <strcat[m]> catfish: Chromium could override it but it chooses not to
06:46:35 <strcat[m]> catfish: it would have been neat if there was a new standard forward gesture but in general that isn't possible to have and then people would be annoyed by trying it and mostly not having it available with a few rare exceptions
06:47:08 <strcat[m]> I'll probably switch the default to gesture mode in the next release
06:47:09 <strcat[m]> I talked myself into it
06:47:33 <strcat[m]> > enable gesture navigation by default to match the stock OS (will change the mode if you haven't ever explicitly set one): swipe left/right to switch apps, swipe up to go home, swipe up and hold for the app overview, swipe from either the left/right edge of the screen to back (you can switch to the old 2-button default or the legacy 3-button navigation mode in Settings → System → Gestures)
06:48:44 <catfish[m]> Yeah it wouldn't really work in the ui. Would be nice if there was an option in chromium to change the behavior.
06:52:46 <Foxtrek_64[m]> If it breaks Chromium I'm worried about what other apps it'll break that don't set the "my gestures win" flag
06:52:54 <strcat[m]> it doesn't break Chromium
06:52:58 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Some apps require swiping left or right to even function properly
06:53:06 <strcat[m]> it has been the default since Android 10
06:53:07 <strcat[m]> it's not new
06:53:13 <strcat[m]> we're deviating from what the stock OS does
06:53:25 <strcat[m]> it's our setting that doesn't really fit into the app ecosystem anymore
06:53:31 <strcat[m]> a lot of apps know how to use the extra space at the bottom now
06:54:37 <strcat[m]> existing app gestures still work fine, it was done in a clever way
06:54:45 <Foxtrek_64[m]> All of the apps I've ever used seem to just scale, sort of like having a status bar at the bottom of a web browser vs not.
06:54:46 <strcat[m]> and that only applies to legacy apps
06:55:05 <strcat[m]> Foxtrek_64: the new thing works differently
06:55:15 <strcat[m]> they can show content at the bottom but there's an area where touch is ignored
06:55:25 <strcat[m]> so legacy apps don't automatically use some of that extra space at the bottom for compatibility
06:55:28 <strcat[m]> apps have to be taught to use it
06:55:44 <strcat[m]> it's not a big deal, either way you have more space
06:55:56 <strcat[m]> but if the apps fully take advantage of it they get more space to display stuff
06:56:29 <strcat[m]> apps scale fine to arbitrary dimensions including dynamically (split screen, free form window mode) because of that being built into the design from the start
06:56:39 <strcat[m]> (although they can make it more efficient / seamless)
06:57:07 <strcat[m]> but the OS doesn't want to screw them over by telling them there's extra space and letting them draw there but not letting users click / swipe on it, etc.
06:57:12 <strcat[m]>  * but the OS doesn't want to screw them over by telling them there's extra space and letting them draw there but not letting users press / swipe on it, etc.
06:57:39 <strcat[m]> a legacy app could theoretically put the final item entry there or something and provide no way to scroll to make it usable
06:57:57 <strcat[m]> so by default, some space is reserved
06:58:02 <strcat[m]> unless they say they know how to use it
07:01:04 <strcat[m]> not really interested in spending so much time on this, gesture mode is the way to go and will be the only option
07:01:37 <strcat[m]> we already had to make multiple changes to work around the legacy modes
07:02:01 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/43f25837bd0cecf72e80897b9ab046aa7c490333
07:02:13 <strcat[m]> 3 button mode is entirely gone for the stock OS so we have to fix any issues for it now
07:02:27 <strcat[m]> 2 button mode only exists on the older devices like Pixel 3 for stock OS
07:02:44 <strcat[m]> we probably should have at least switched the default sooner for newer gen devices
07:02:54 <strcat[m]> just going to switch the default in the next release for everything
07:03:53 <strcat[m]> really silly thing for people to fret about, gesture mode is as I said pretty much objectively superior in every way and the way it's done (at least in Android 11's 2nd quarterly release) was pretty clever to work around legacy apps
07:04:03 <strcat[m]> and modern apps are built with it in mind
07:04:47 <strcat[m]> for some reason Samsung often flipped the order around, their weird way of being different for the sake of being different, not something AOSP / stock OS ever had
07:04:54 <strcat[m]> but those buttons are a legacy thing now
07:05:16 <strcat[m]> Samsung has their own drastically different OS
07:05:41 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I'd rather have a physical button. I'm playing with gesture mode now and it's not too bad. Just doesn't work well with my workflow, so despite possibly very well being superior in every other category, this is a killer for me.
07:06:23 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Maybe I'll get used to it eventually but eh
07:06:31 <strcat[m]> you would get used to it pretty fast
07:06:38 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I still miss my hardware button honestly.
07:08:01 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Rather sad the Android community just decided "gestures or gtfo" though, especially when iPhone isn't really an option and Windows Phone is dead.
07:08:01 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Linux phones exist but they're more test beds than actual production phones.
07:08:04 <strcat[m]> the best way to switch apps is swipe left on nav bar and ignore app overview for the most part now
07:08:34 <strcat[m]> it always used gestures though
07:08:45 <strcat[m]> swipe to scroll, pinch to zoom, many others
07:09:02 <strcat[m]> having a pretty large chunk of the screen to show 3 buttons is kinda weird
07:09:37 <Foxtrek_64[m]> There's a sense of security that comes from having something there. It'd be like if Windows took away the start button or if Linux took away the dock.
07:09:38 <strcat[m]> it's because phones used to have 3 buttons down there and it was there to emulate them
07:09:45 <strcat[m]> maybe they should have just gone straight to gestures
07:11:12 <strcat[m]> the new way also makes a lot more sense when using a physical keyboard (and optionally mouse too)
07:11:31 <strcat[m]> it's pretty awkward having that huge row reserved on a tablet too
07:11:38 <strcat[m]> phones are pretty tall so it's bit less weird
07:11:44 <strcat[m]> imo it was always a weird design
07:11:52 <strcat[m]> so was apple having their single button (home)
07:11:56 <strcat[m]> that was particularly weird
07:11:59 <strcat[m]> they kept that for so long
07:12:11 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I don't know anyone who plugs a keyboard and mouse into their phone. I've seen it as a sort of novel things on Linux phones because they advertise it as "your phone is also your desktop!" but never on Android.
07:12:21 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Though I do know it is technically possible to do.
07:12:27 <strcat[m]> people use little bluetooth or wired keyboards
07:12:32 <strcat[m]> they are really tiny and fold up
07:12:42 <strcat[m]> can go in a different pocket
07:13:08 <strcat[m]> and tablets exist
07:13:23 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS works fine on tablets we just don't have a good one to support atm
07:14:06 <strcat[m]> AOSP even has a kind of desktop mode and that works well, after all that's what ChromeOS uses (via Android in a container)
07:20:00 <strcat[m]> there are keybinds for physical keyboards and mice are supported just fine too even on phones
07:32:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> IMHO GOS on a tablet would be great.As would being able to use the phone as a desktop for most normal use cases like mail, chat, browsing...One really secure device and os for almost everything instead of having to secure different device-specific os. 👍Any good place to start reading up on that?
08:36:56 <SMXfan1001> Trying to get a phone that doesn't spy on me.  But not very tech savvy.
08:46:06 <SMXfan1001> https://www.privacytools.io recommends GrapheneOS alongside calyxos.org and LineageOS.  I guess I'm looking for the one that is the most user friendly for a non-techy, but is still trustworthy.
08:46:52 <SMXfan1001> Can anyone see my chat lines?
08:58:44 <strcat[m]> yes
08:59:29 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is explained on our site
08:59:30 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
08:59:41 <strcat[m]> we focus on making substantial privacy and security improvements to the OS
09:00:06 <strcat[m]> and we don't include Google apps or services, but that's more what we don't do as opposed to what we actually work on
09:02:44 <hwzs621> I used my GrapheneOS phone for some time now but since yesterday when i boot the boot process gets stuck on the sceen showing "GrapheneOS"
09:03:10 <hwzs621> any idea what to do? There is some data on the phone which i did not back up.
09:03:55 <helloworldkk87[m> It might be installing the newest update. Is it stuck there for over 10 minutes?
09:04:13 <hwzs621> yes it is
09:06:48 <strcat[m]> hwzs621: force reboot it a few times
09:08:08 <hwzs621> just keeping the power buttom pressed so it shuts down after like 20 seconds and then powering it on again?
09:08:40 <strcat[m]> yes

09:15:34 <jdjdjsjsushwhajd> I get this message at bootup. Is this normal? Or shall i worry?
09:15:40 <helloworldkk87[m> Its normal
09:17:37 <hwzs621> any other idea besides wiping?
09:20:35 <jdjdjsjsushwhajd> <helloworldkk87[m "Its normal"> Thanks:)
09:22:24 <helloworldkk87[m> <jdjdjsjsushwhajd "Thanks:)"> Yeah its part of verified boot when loading a non-stock OS
09:45:00 <hwzs621> i am back :)
09:47:44 <hwzs621> can something be done other than wiping? -like with adb?
10:34:19 <strcat[m]> hwzs621: it sounds like it isn't booting
10:34:22 <strcat[m]> so not much you can do
10:34:36 <strcat[m]> unless you already had adb enabled and it's booting that far
10:34:45 <strcat[m]> but you wouldn't be able to really do anything
10:34:59 <strcat[m]> you could perhaps figure out what's happening
11:06:02 <SMXfan1001> bye everyone.
11:29:25 <hwzs621> what command would i need to put in to see what is going on?
11:42:30 <satrapes> GrapheneOS prospective user. The reason many of us want to switch to GrapheneOS is to get rid of Google services and tracking. Why is it that we still have to pay them money to do it? I mean I get that the hardware satisfies the requirements

11:58:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> coming back to your question, satrapes
11:58:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> long story short, you must trust your manufacturer
11:59:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> unless you build and design the hardware yourself, from ground up, there is no way avoiding that
12:00:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that's why, while using your Pixel phone, no matter which OS you are using, you must trust Google and TSMC (the manufacturer)

13:39:15 <_mo> quick question regarding "We’ll be implementing this in the near future to provide the option of using GrapheneOS builds of microG." - is there already a rough timeline for this?
13:43:45 <helloworldkk87[m> Where did you read that
13:44:51 <helloworldkk87[m> There will be stub implemention of the playservice API but no actual service.
14:06:27 <_mo> was mentioned here https://www.kuketz-blog.de/erneut-rueckmeldung-von-daniel-micay-grapheneos-entwickler/ and are quotes from Daniel Micay
14:10:30 <_mo> really Im just looking to get a working microG down the line as non-instant messenger is annoying and the country-wide taxi app not working at all (it embeds gmaps to display/track the taxi you requested) is an actual problem
14:12:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If there are essential to you apps, which don't function without Google play services, and there are no alternatives for these apps, you better off with Stock
14:14:55 <helloworldkk87[m> That is old info, first they were suppose to implement actual microg but they are not going to do that.
14:15:18 <helloworldkk87[m> Up-To-Date info on topic: https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services
14:24:43 <_mo> thanks thats helpful. Im gonna have a look if theres replacement taxi apps (had not even thought of that)
14:26:09 <_mo> The way I see it with Huawei having ungoogled their phones is hopefully a massive driver towards removing google dependencies in the future but until then its still a bit wonky to get stuff to work
14:36:18 <__Mario__> Hi!
14:36:18 <__Mario__> I have a question to ask.
14:36:19 <__Mario__> I am considering buying a Google Pixel 5 and installing GrapheneOS on it.
14:36:19 <__Mario__> However, I didn't find alternatives for Duolingo and WeChat, and which I both really need. I saw it was possible to install apps by APKs.
14:36:20 <__Mario__> As the Pixel 5 isn't a cheap phone, I want to be sure everything will be fine before buying anything.
14:36:20 <__Mario__> Did anyone got these two apps to work?
14:36:20 <__Mario__> Thanks in advance for your answers :-)
14:50:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> __Mario__: do they require Google play services?
14:50:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Specifically for the parts that you need
14:51:46 <helloworldkk87[m> According to Plexus they should work but have not tested. https://plexus.techlore.tech/
14:52:27 <orz[m]> lmao I was going to link that, then I remembered the publisher..
14:52:47 <helloworldkk87[m> I think its fine
14:56:48 <__Mario__> Railgun_Lover[m] How can I know if they require Google Play services?
14:56:55 <__Mario__> I am an iPhone user atm haha
14:57:18 <__Mario__> Thanks a lot for the website, helloworldkk87[m
14:57:31 <__Mario__> I didn't know about it
14:59:57 <__Mario__> I guess this gives me confidence that these two apps should work fine
15:02:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <__Mario__ "I am impersonating Railgun_Lover"> Google
15:02:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> xearch
15:02:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]>  * search
15:04:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If that doesn't turn up results, then
15:05:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> if you can borrow any Android phone, then borrow it, install those apps, disable Play Services, and see if it works.
15:06:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Some parts might break, but if you don't need those parts then GrapheneOS is still fine.
15:08:06 <__Mario__> Oh ok, then I will try to do that with my ereader which is an Android one
15:08:15 <__Mario__> Thanks a lot for your help
15:08:41 <__Mario__> Google didn't return any relevant result about Duolingo and Wechat
15:10:09 <__Mario__> Hopefully this works
15:20:07 <djentosaurus[m]> Jo guys, I just installed GrapheneOS on my Google Pixel phone. but when I activate the phone I get a message that says: you device is loading a different operating system (with a yellow exlamation mark). Is there a way to get rid of this?
15:30:34 <Pratyush[m]> djentosaurus:  this is expected, this is just an message that trying to say "Your bootloader is locked and your device is running with verified boot" but this is not official stock os, custom one.
15:30:34 <Pratyush[m]> don't worry about that.
15:30:51 <djentosaurus[m]> Thanks!
15:31:14 <djentosaurus[m]> So how is everybody feeling about GrapheneOs here?

16:06:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "How do I install F Droid on my p"> Download the APK from fdroid.org, hash it to make sure it hasn't been tampered with.
16:07:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> er, looks like they don't have an option to hash it, so verify it using PGP instead.
16:07:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <jello49 "trying to get grapheneos running"> You'll need to be more specific. What's the error message, which step, etc
16:19:06 <jello49> thanks for your answer. I dont get any error messages. I unlocked the boot loader with fastboot. then I downloaded the latest version of grapheneos and unpacked it into platform tools folder. when i click flash-all.bat the command line flashes and disappears. no error message. using windows 10.

16:30:57 <djentosaurus[m]> And what does PGP mean?
16:33:03 <djentosaurus[m]> What is an APK?

17:06:37 <consistent_salt_> I've got a strange request, but I was wondering if it would be possible to customize UI roundness since the nee styles and colors picker was also introduced? The roundness changes depending on the style you pick, it would be nice if those two could be made somehow independent
17:27:49 <Ornstein> Hey guys, short question: I'd like to install the Signal Messenger on GrapheneOS. Should I use the (old) APK from their website or would you recommend using the Aurora Store?
17:33:41 <dnull> Aurora is fine
17:38:18 <Ornstein> ok, thanks!
17:39:13 <satrapes_> helloworldkk87[m: you are right, I just mentioned this in short. In reality the long story is that grapheneos is geared towards privacy and security and one of the most pervasive companies threatening privacy especially is Google
18:26:23 <rng5413> Sadly I have to go back from GrapheneOS to stock on a Pixel 4a... >.<  But on the homepage it only says it's the same process (https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os). Could you pls tell me how it's done exactly? Where do I find the right image etc.?
18:29:33 <dazinism> rng5413: the easy way is to use https://flash.android.com/
18:30:42 <rng5413> ok, seems pretty easy. thanks alot!
18:30:50 <dazinism> For completeness think after its done you can use the GrapheneOS web installer
18:31:08 <dazinism> To delete the Graphene verified boot keys
18:31:43 <rng5413> allready seen the hint, yeah
18:43:40 <caleb[m]> @DValin21: feel free to include the rest of the 7 series, I own a 7 Pro and would be happy to help

19:05:27 <dazinism> Oneplus don't do a great job of securing their devices though.  The constantly mess stuff up. Anu has fixed some stuff in GlassROM, other stuff can't be fixed

Is there any trick or special setting required to get this to work? It's formatted NTFS, so maybe that's the problem. Will it only work with FAT32 or some other format?

19:17:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sorry
19:17:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should definitely not use nrfs for this
19:18:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> * ntfs
19:18:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> fat32 might do, but i don't really know
19:18:46 <dazinism> joltman: yeah fat32 works
19:19:12 <joltman[m]> or would exFAT work?
19:19:39 <dazinism> Possibly estate, if I'm not confused there was talk of it being added
19:19:51 <dazinism> A couple of years ago. Not sure if that happened
19:20:06 <dazinism> Added to android
19:20:38 <dazinism> Guess a web search would get the answers.
19:21:15 <dazinism> *possibly exfat (grrr auto spell )
19:21:23 <joltman[m]> do you have to change any settings before the pixel will recognize usb storage or will it recognize by default?
19:21:44 <helloworldkk87[m> * The point of GrapheneOS is not to de-google
19:21:46 <dazinism> Needs to be unlocked when its plugged in
19:22:00 <dazinism> Or plugged in when turned on
19:22:15 <dazinism> Unless you've changed the settings
19:22:57 <joltman[m]> That setting is unchanged...still set to the phone just needing to be unlocked.
19:23:15 <joltman[m]> Let me see if I can find another computer that will format to FAT32
19:23:37 <joltman[m]> my new laptop only does NTFS and exFAT and neither is being recognized
19:23:44 <trail_undergroun> <dazinism "Oneplus don't do a great job of "> OnePlus is kinda sketchy. Just about every company is tbh. Google & Apple are the least sketchy but thats a pretty low bar.
19:24:13 <trail_undergroun> Hey quick question, does it show that I'm still typing?
19:26:06 <joltman[m]> can win10 format anything fat32?
19:27:08 <joltman[m]> looks like i can prob do it from command line. file manager doesn't support it.
19:30:57 <joltman[m]> can't format a 128GB drive as FAT32
19:33:34 <joltman[m]> So, is it even possible to backup to 128GB USB drives with SeedVault?
19:37:10 <joltman[m]> doesn't seem like it
19:38:23 <joltman[m]> or do i need to go to linux and format as ext3 or something?
19:45:27 <annochris> Can anyone help with this, I have google play update on my phone, I have a google pixel, is that normal seen as I'm running graph
19:48:16 <annochris> Hay anyone there?
19:58:10 <dazinism> @joltman:matrix.org: i've got a 1tb external hard drive thats fat32 and works fine with my 3XL
19:59:54 <dazinism> Apparently exFAT is now supported in Android. IIRC it depends on the kernel you are running, so maybe only on newer Pixels?
20:00:11 <joltman[m]> I have 3XL also
20:00:32 <dazinism> joltman: i think ext3 and ext4 should also work
20:00:34 <joltman[m]> Was trying with a SanDisk 128GB flash drive
20:01:10 <dazinism> I haven't got anything formatted exFAT to try with my phone
20:01:12 <joltman[m]> Win10 from command prompt wouldn't format FAT32 that large
20:01:39 <joltman[m]> I formatted exFAT, but 3XL still didn't seem to recognize it
20:02:03 <dazinism> Think formatted the 1tb from some desktop linux
20:02:22 <dazinism> As fat32
20:03:14 <joltman[m]> Might need to find a small flash drive and format it FAT32 and see if it will at least recognize it, but I just left the house to get auto service and didn't bring any of the flash drives with me.
20:04:36 <dazinism> joltman: you've definitely got a good working OTG adaptor?
20:06:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D​valin21> Thanks.  I think i already need help.  I noticed that there is a "graphene" folder in vendor.  Would i need to create such folder or would i need to create a config.json file?
20:07:35 <joltman[m]> That's why i want to check a small FAT32 drive...to verify that OTG works. It's new.
20:09:49 <joltman[m]> FAT32 should go up to 4GB file size and 8TB partition
20:12:42 <joltman[m]> not sure why FORMAT command on Win10 command line was complaining the volume was too big for FAT32
20:43:54 <joltman[m]> Have a 4GB FAT32 flash drive and it is recognized so OTG adapter seems to work fine
20:44:11 <joltman[m]> Will just need to figure out why I can't format the 128GB flash drive as FAT32 now
20:47:11 <hunter5[m]> Everytime I unlock via fingerprint I also get prompted for the passphrase. That's not supposed to happen right.
20:54:03 <hunter5[m]> Ok I figured it out
21:03:16 <b1101> exfat > fat32
21:06:11 <joltman[m]> doesn't matter if pixel 3xl doesn't recognize exfat
21:07:02 <joltman[m]> it looks like I can use command line for full format of 128GB flash drive from command line, but it won't let me quick format it. gonna take a while.

23:15:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> let me help you
23:16:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which OS, browser, cable, and ports are you using?
23:16:32 <hey> Its "unpacking system" and stops halfway... 30 min now
23:17:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hey: which OS, browser, cable, and ports are you using?
23:18:43 <hey> I'm on an Raspberry PI 4B. running Debian. I installed the SDK and ADB stuff and the process works smoothly until this point.  I think it just times out.
23:19:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> alright, if i recall correctly you are using the CLI installation guide, right?
23:19:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i highly recommend you to use the web-installation method instead
23:20:17 <hey> im using the web installation method
23:20:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, it seems like you're using some unofficial guide for your installation
23:20:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you don't need neither SDK nor ADB
23:20:49 <hey> its the https://grapheneos.org/install/web#prerequisites
23:20:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> moreover, you should remove them altogether
23:21:19 <hey> it wouldnt recognize the device without those
23:21:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which means something else is wrong
23:21:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> delete everything and start over
23:22:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> don't do stuff that's not on the guide
23:22:05 <hey> well it recognized the device once they were installed.
23:22:17 <hey> Its was in the giude
23:22:41 <hey> Flashing as non-root
23:22:41 <hey> On traditional Linux distributions, USB devices cannot be used as non-root without udev rules for each type of device. This is not an issue for other platforms.
23:22:42 <hey> On Arch Linux, install the android-udev package. On Debian and Ubuntu, install the android-sdk-platform-tools-common package.
23:22:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Hulk shared a photo on Telegram with caption: 'no it's not'
23:23:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, but adb is not
23:24:03 <hey> if ADB is a program on the PI that is not needed during the installation, why would it jam things up?
23:24:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it might, and probably does, interfere with the installation
23:24:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which browser are using for the installation?
23:24:50 <hey> I'll remove that and get back to you.  how long should the flash process take?
23:25:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> depends on the phone

23:27:03 <hey> OK, next question how do I start over? phone has already been wiped and halfway into loading the system.  I can't reload the original firmware from google as that's designed for a PC
23:27:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's fine, it will rewrite everything
23:28:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but once everything is ready, you should start from https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader
23:30:55 <hey> i just removed the ADB files.  starting over now.
23:31:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i bet that the USB C port on your Raspberry is not reliable tho
23:31:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> ADB has nothing to do in the process. You need fastboot.
23:31:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Or android-dev-tools, the package the Web Install asks you to install.
23:32:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> we will see, proceed with the installation, and if the problem persist you might want to try a different host computer
23:33:39 <hey> i have installed the android-sdk-platform-tools-common
23:34:04 <hey> ok
23:49:51 <hey> hey there
23:50:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i'm here
23:50:07 <hey> i rebooted and got hung at the same spot
23:50:30 <hey> I will try my kids gaming PC
23:50:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hmm, are using the cable that came with your phone?
23:50:58 <hey> I can't be the only one trying to load Graphene from a PI
23:51:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, you also have a good probability of getting it done using another Android phone with the USB C port
23:51:25 <hey> yes
23:53:08 <hey> really? wait, just USBC to USBC and use the same web page?  off another Graphen OS phone? yes I have one.
23:53:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sure!
23:53:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's the most easiest way
23:53:44 <hey> What would I need to download onto the other phone for the process?
23:53:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> just the browser
23:54:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> default chrome would do
23:54:09 <hey> wait, its running Vanadium
23:54:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Vanadium - perfect
23:54:52 <hey> all the collection software on the chrome browser would be sending info back to google, no?
23:55:30 <hey> i'm trying to stay away from google (so i bought a google phone)
23:55:45 <hey> ok here goes
