00:00:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. I understand that a lot of people who would consider something like this are after psychological reassurance, but it's little more than that.
00:02:37 <TheJollyRoger> quipoa[m]: for best security, your best bet is to use GrapheneOS as normal, without trying to do any "power user" tuning.
00:02:54 <TheJollyRoger> The defaults on GrapheneOS have been very carefully considered, and may be used with confidence.
00:04:28 <quipoa[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you for all this information
00:04:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome!
00:36:52 <FBI[m]> Is there any way to create a Twitter account anonynously?
00:38:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hi FBI[m], this topic is not really topical to GrapheneOS, but the short answer is no, not really, they require phone number validation and will blacklist most numbers that map to prepaid mobile providers or VOIP providers.
00:38:47 <TheJollyRoger> FBI[m]: it looks like someone is trying to reach you on that subject in #grapheneos-offtopic.
00:38:48 <timetravelingman> I made mine without a phone number
00:38:54 <timetravelingman> They just push you hard to do it
00:38:57 <timetravelingman> But you don't have to
00:41:46 <FBI[m]> Nice
00:51:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> TheJollyRogerIronic, since Edward Snowden advices in removing the camera and the microphone out of the device.Though my threat model is lower so I opt not to do that.
00:53:43 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles in all honesty, just because Edward Snowden says he would do it for himself, it doesn't necessarily mean it's right for you, or that it's objectively the correct way.
00:58:29 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - for instance, the diplomatic hotline between the Kremlin and the United States, and indeed several other countries, uses the One Time Pad cipher, with keys in the forms of tapes that are delivered via diplomatic courier under armed guards. Sure, that cipher is mathematically proven to be safe against cryptanalysis with any amount of computer power. However, that doesn't
00:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> necessarily mean you're going to benefit or gain any appreciable amount of security from immediately switching to using One Time Pads to communicate with your friends.
00:58:46 <TheJollyRoger> *under armed guard.
00:59:42 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Is there any way I can get paid apps from the play store that i once purchased onto Graphene?
01:00:41 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, I don't think Ed really thought it through in that if you don't  go as far as removing the speakers or delidding the SoC and laser cutting the sensors (don't bother about this, you'd need specialized tooling to do this, and the chip is likely to only work for a few seconds after the modification afterward before dying), you're not going to be able to prevent the phone from recording
01:00:44 <TheJollyRoger> audio.
01:01:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hey mr_hebi_san[m] I don't think so, not offhand. I think paid apps do something funny with Play Services to validate paid installs.
01:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> I could be wrong though, since I'm not quite up to date on this.
01:01:54 <TheJollyRoger> (note that when I say "you need specialized tooling to delid and modify a chip post-manufacture" I mean machines and laboratory setups costing millions of dollars)
01:02:12 <skagreek[m]> TheJollyRoger: "One Time Pad cipher, with keys in the forms of tapes"   That's nuts!
01:02:52 <skagreek[m]> By "nuts" I mean, there's crazy shit going on that we never think of.
01:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> skagreek[m]: yep, it's definitely nuts!
01:11:38 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles: For instance, in that example, just because the cipher might be unbreakable, think to yourself: is your implementation good? Are your keys generated with perfect randomness? (a biased RNG completely reduces the security of the One Time Pad cipher to near-zero, so that means you almost certainly cannot use a computer that's not equipped with a TRNG to generate the keys). Are you
01:11:41 <TheJollyRoger> able to trust the transport layer for message integrity and sender authentication? (the answer to this, is "no"). What about key storage? Do you have a perimeter established and armed guards you can trust to store the materials? This is why "performative opsec" to try to gain security in some aspects, without taking into account the big picture or adequately thinking your threat model through,
01:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> will very often end badly, and you may not realize it until much later.
01:12:50 <TheJollyRoger> Doing things such as desoldering the microphones and cameras is the same way - sure, it might look good in some very, very, VERRRRRY niche situations and "in theory", but in the big picture of things, it's likely going to end you up with a phone you can no longer use because you might have touched the screen backing which is thinner than a wafer and crumbles just about as easily, rendering your
01:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> prized phone useless.
01:13:19 <TheJollyRoger> *because yo umight have touched the screen backing when you tried to open the phone - and that screen backing is thinner than a wafer
01:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hopefully, this analogy ought to shed some light on the topic of desoldering/excising the microphones/cameras from your phone.
01:20:00 <FBI[m]> <timetravelingman "I made mine without a phone numb"> How do I skip it?

01:22:36 <skagreek[m]> i better keep the political stuff out of here.
01:23:39 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Well, Twitter accounts aren't really topical to this room, but you guys can definitely continue over at #grapheneos-offtopic .
01:25:24 <FBI[m]> Ok
01:33:42 <timetravelingman> <FBI[m] "How do I skip it?"> I don't remember lmao
01:33:47 <timetravelingman> Sorry boss
01:34:58 <timetravelingman> I used my email tho
01:47:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <FBI[m] ACTION uploaded an image> ùîºùî∏ùïäùïê, ‚ÑùùïÄùîæ‚Ñçùïã?!
01:50:41 <strcat[m]> @room the CalyxOS developers are continuing to participate in Copperhead-like behavior spreading personal insults, dishonest claims and other desperate attacks on GrapheneOS
01:51:06 <strcat[m]> @room this includes participating in bullying and harassment of GrapheneOS developers targeted at people personally with their real life names
01:51:47 <strcat[m]> @room people involved in that project should leave the channel, thanks
01:52:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> strcat[m]: Astonishing that once I knew as a fair competitor is opting to go feral on their oponents.They are definitely off their trolleys.
01:52:53 <strcat[m]> we'll be starting to take a similar tact to dealing with them as we do with the comparable attacks from Copperhead, which means we'll be posting fact-based responses every time we see them doing this, which has happened throughout the day and particularly recently
01:53:25 <strcat[m]> so, going to be making some posts on Reddit similar to how we take that approach with Copperhead when they spread misinformation and attack the project/developers
01:54:01 <strcat[m]> the way this works is that if they spread misinformation and attacks on us, we write fact-based responses and show people what they have been doing
01:54:42 <strcat[m]> same as Copperhead, since the people in charge of both are quite similar personalities and are only likely to change their behavior based on self-interest
01:55:11 <skwisgaar[m]> Must say I‚Äôm surprised that they would stoop that low, my initial impression of them was very inaccurate. Thanks for the update.
01:56:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> strcat[m]: Considering that CalyxOS actively "supports" old devices, I am dissapointed at them... I overestimated them, they are no better than Copperhead.
01:57:33 <TheJollyRoger> Captain, captain no.
01:57:36 <TheJollyRoger> No dammit.
01:57:41 <TheJollyRoger> I...
01:57:45 <TheJollyRoger> Argh.
01:59:14 <sethsimmons> The paranoia is incredible, I have seen nothing to support this ridiculous claim that Calyx is attacking anyone within Graphene.
01:59:36 <sethsimmons> They have been acting and speaking without any focus on all this terrible drama in every interaction I have had with them and in every chat room.
01:59:36 <strcat[m]> sethsimmons is someone who has spread dishonest claims about GrapheneOS as part of supporting CopperheadOS
01:59:47 <strcat[m]> he made false accusations without evidence and spread misinformation about what the project has done
01:59:58 <strcat[m]> along with misleading people about the differences between GrapheneOS and those other OSes
02:00:06 <sethsimmons> The paranoia rampant in GOS is palpable and devastating to its own community and the privacy ecosystem at large.
02:00:17 <strcat[m]> I don't know why he was in the channel at all
02:00:19 <TheJollyRoger> Captain, I need to... I need to take some time off.
02:00:21 <strcat[m]> he's a Copperhead shill
02:00:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> strcat[m]: Figures... they think of us as twerps.
02:00:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'm sorry.
02:00:46 <strcat[m]> there is no paranoia
02:00:59 <strcat[m]> you can search Nick's IRC messages and see he participates daily in personal insults / bullying
02:01:06 <strcat[m]> and you can see he has supported others doing the same
02:01:17 <strcat[m]> he's the leader of the project and is pretty much just like James Donaldson
02:02:01 <strcat[m]> so, while it doesn't apply to other developers working on it, the person in charge of the project is regularly spreading misinformation and participating in bullying
02:02:16 <strcat[m]> and that definitely reflects on the project
02:02:32 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy nahman[m], welcome aboard.
02:02:35 <strcat[m]> as does their spreading of misinformation and dishonest claims which demonstrates it isn't trustworthy/reliable
02:03:18 <nahman[m]> Howdy howdy
02:04:20 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step away from the PC for a bit, will return later.
02:05:23 <strcat[m]> nahman: you've recently participated in spreading misinformation and dishonest attacks on GrapheneOS including supporting the attacks by Copperhead made on the project
02:05:43 <strcat[m]> nahman: so did you just join here to concern troll or something as part of the attacks being made on the project today?
02:05:53 <strcat[m]> nahman: or are you actually here in good faith
02:06:00 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m], no, he's here interested in the stub API.
02:06:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Tigeroz has joined the Telegram Group!
02:06:11 <strcat[m]> well, what he did in that other channel needs to be justified
02:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> He's here interested in the stubbing out of the play services API as well as the security improvements we've made to Chromium as Vanadium, and the hardened application sandboxing.
02:07:03 <strcat[m]> it doesn't excuse what they did
02:07:23 <strcat[m]> people who spread misinformation, dishonest attacks and who support bullying/harassment are not welcome here
02:07:42 <TheJollyRoger> With all due respect, Captain, it's shooting from the hip that turns popular opinion against this project.
02:07:46 <strcat[m]> so, without a response, and some way of repairing what they have done, enforcing the basic channel rules means they will be banned
02:07:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> hey guys, i'm a proud new graphene user üòÅüëç i have a question: it is possible to set up several profiles with shelter as just one work profile?
02:08:08 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I don't need to permit bullies to simply come here and participate while attacking our developers and community with misinformation elsewhere
02:08:12 <GroverWilson[m]> I have graphene installed. I was wondering about disk encryption. is that already turned on?
02:08:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy @Tigeroz, welcome aboard! It's possible to set up work profiles in multiple profiles on GrapheneOS,
02:08:35 <strcat[m]> people don't get to organize raids and spreading misinformation on our project in a channel largely used to coordinate and participate in that
02:08:39 <TheJollyRoger> we don't recommend using apps like Shelter though, because they own the data in their respective work profiles.
02:08:39 <strcat[m]> and then come here and pretend they aren't doing that
02:08:57 <TheJollyRoger> GroverWilson[m]: Ahoy there! Your question's been answered on the FAQ, let me retrieve it for you.
02:09:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> Sounds nice
02:09:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> Would be nice! :)
02:09:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> Thank you
02:09:24 <strcat[m]> multiple people there are involved in making completely dishonest claims and coordinating spreading misinformation and raiding this channel
02:09:53 <strcat[m]> going through the logs and people breaking the channel rules will be removed from the channel here
02:09:57 <TheJollyRoger> GroverWilson[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption Android, Pixels, and by extension GrapheneOS has an extremely sophisticated file based encryption setup. Plaintext is never written to the disk.
02:10:06 <GroverWilson[m]> sweet, thanks
02:10:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> strcat[m]: What is worse is that there is a wazzock directly attacking GrapheneOS on a Lemmy post, making itself the martyr.
02:10:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> What
02:10:38 <strcat[m]> I'll be making posts on Twitter and Reddit about the recent escalation of attacks and misinformation from CalyxOS today
02:11:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Lemmy = social network
02:11:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wazzock
02:11:12 <strcat[m]> they're 100% invested in taking the Copperhead route now
02:11:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> I was more confused about wazzock
02:11:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> Bri'ish
02:11:32 <strcat[m]> quite unfortunate that people are more focused on causing harm than building anything good
02:11:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> I do not see myself living in America if I ever move.
02:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> Captain, you told me a while back that bans and shooting from the hip like this is what turns people -- and popular opinion -- against GrapheneOS and to exercise discretion.
02:12:12 <strcat[m]> nahman: you're welcome to reach out and explain what you were doing and how you plan on making up for the harm caused
02:12:35 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I am being very specific in who gets banned
02:12:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Latin American but looking forward to moving to Europe.@madaidan
02:12:59 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: people who directly spread dishonest claims, supported Copperhead's attacks on the projects, participated in bullying targeted at individuals, etc.
02:13:09 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: going to be banning perhaps ~10 people
02:13:20 <strcat[m]> logs available to show why they were banned
02:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, dammit strcat[m], forget about the gimmick, I'm going to protest this. This kind of protectionism's not going to do us any favours in the long run.
02:17:27 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the rules forbid people who participate in harassment/bullying
02:17:29 <strcat[m]> and spreading misinformation
02:17:34 <strcat[m]> from simply participating in this community as if they don't
02:17:50 <strcat[m]> I have logs available for each person who gets banned showing they were involved in that
02:18:17 <strcat[m]> it's really not helpful to pretend I am doing anything inappropriate by enforcing the basic channel rules
02:18:40 <strcat[m]> scrolling through their logs today and banning people involved in it, simple
02:18:49 <strcat[m]>  * scrolling through their logs today and banning people involved in spreading misinformation and bullying, simple
02:19:19 <TheJollyRoger> I need to step off the computer for a bit.
02:21:05 <strcat[m]> btw Shipp in the CalyxOS channel is a persistent 4chan-tier troll who has harassed me and spread attacks on me based on me having depression
02:21:21 <strcat[m]> and he's welcome to participate in the CalyxOS community and to regularly make up false claims and personal attacks / bullying targeted towards me
02:21:26 <strcat[m]> and they help him with doing that
02:21:49 <strcat[m]> techlore has also repeatedly done the same including making personal attacks on me and directing harassment towards me based on me having depression
02:21:59 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS fully supports and promotes this
02:22:04 <strcat[m]> that is the level they stoop to
02:22:36 <strcat[m]> and yet people like Shipp make up stories and pretend that they are the victims
02:22:42 <strcat[m]> very similar to what Copperhead does
02:22:52 <strcat[m]> take a look at their IRC channel logs for today
02:26:45 <madaidan[m]> Shipp also constantly harasses and slanders me personally.
02:27:07 <madaidan[m]> He has some extreme obsession with Firefox and loathes that we have pointed out its security issues.
02:28:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Nice how innocently he turns out to be at first... he said, "hi, can anyone with vandium on graphene os test a css side channel attack used for fingerprinting to see if it can mitigate?". I found it at the off-topic group.
02:28:06 <fierybinary[m]> Lol, why are some people so cultish about software?
02:28:17 <madaidan[m]> The harassment towards you is significantly greater than just those comments about depression.
02:29:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> One of the very little logs actually kept on the Telegram group.
02:33:03 <zzxx123_> why are they attacking someone for having depression
02:33:04 <zzxx123_> wtf
02:33:53 <wish_i_was_real[> What happened with calyxOS?
02:34:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> zzxx123_: People should not be insulted in such a way. Neither autism nor depression should be taken as a joke.
02:34:49 <madaidan[m]> <zzxx123_ "why are they attacking someone f"> I could post screenshots but it's pretty vile.
02:35:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Those mugs turned out to be no better than Copperhead.
02:36:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> wish_i_was_real: I was replying to you btw.
02:36:51 <wish_i_was_real[> Copperhead 2.0?
02:37:13 <timetravelingman> CalyxHead

02:37:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> timetravelingman: May as well call those twunts that.
02:38:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> wish_i_was_real: People could get LineageOS for that. No big deal.
02:39:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Not that CalyxOS was absolutely hardened anyways.
02:39:49 <wish_i_was_real[> Yeah but sems that lineage is a security nightmare
02:41:09 <wish_i_was_real[> But the good thing is that lineage can't deviate from their goal after what happened with cyanogenmod
02:41:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> CalyxOS' version of Chromium is somewhat duff, or so I have heard.
02:43:19 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I would appreciate if you showed people screenshots
02:44:26 <wish_i_was_real[> I would appreciate if all of this drama is switched to the off topic channel
02:50:14 <strcat[m]> wish_i_was_real: just a temporary thing hopefully based on attacks being made on the project today
02:51:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> @madaidan Hey, somebody is calling you.

03:05:03 <matic_nick[m]> Personal attacks like this is just plain wrong
03:05:06 <poisonoushydra[m> Wow, just... wow...
03:05:53 <fierybinary[m]> Calling someone crazy/insane and naive is bad
03:06:17 <wish_i_was_real[> i say it because if is a one off i see it more of a banter but considering daniel's challenges and what he's doing i can understand that it is wrong
03:06:17 <fierybinary[m]> Calling someone that who has contributed much to open-source and makes a very secure operating system

03:07:11 <fierybinary[m]> It's not one-off banter, it's harassment and bullying

03:16:50 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: alright, I'll explain it in simpler terms then: GrapheneOS considers Play Services to be invasive, however, many third-party apps tactitly assume that Play Services are present and functioning on all handsets, and are not written to function, or are even written not to function without them.
03:17:26 <chi00[m]> so, even if they don't really need it the apps don't work without it?
03:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: Because GrapheneOS considers Play Services to be invasive, we will NOT implement them, and we will definitely not implement them via third-party handlers, even if those third party handlers are open source.
03:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: that's correct. This is why some apps, namely banking apps and some fitness apps will suddenly crash when told to connect, or when opened.
03:18:03 <chi00[m]> ah ok. No google on my device plz
03:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> Because they're asking for Google, which GrapheneOS does not have.
03:18:28 <chi00[m]> kinda shitty that they only support their phones for 3 years
03:18:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> If you want to DeGoogle you must get rid of Google Services.
03:18:50 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: Rest assured, GrapheneOS will not be implementing Play Services, BUT, what we are considering is stubbing out that functionality.
03:19:09 <chi00[m]> especially their flagships, I know they wat their money. I'd rather pay a bit more for a few more years of updates
03:19:13 <TheJollyRoger> What the stub would do, would be that GrapheneOS would return "Error 503: Services Offline" whenever an app tries to reach Google Play Services.
03:19:33 <fierybinary[m]> <chi00[m] "kinda shitty that they only supp"> Google is better than other manufacturers
03:19:51 <fierybinary[m]> Many phones get less than 2 years
03:19:52 <chi00[m]> so, it'd make the apps think the srvices exist, and this would allow some of them to function properly?
03:20:07 <chi00[m]> at least the ones that don't rely on push notifications or other stuff?
03:20:12 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: you're close. The stub would trick the apps into thinking that Google has vanished.
03:20:20 <TheJollyRoger> Or that Google's Servers are offline.
03:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> So that way, apps that crash when they don't see play services on your phone can either fail gracefully, or are forced to function offline.
03:21:33 <TheJollyRoger> *or are forced to function offline, or without them.
03:21:41 <chi00[m]> kinda off topic, but Sailfish OS has really extended the lifetime of Sony's Xperia devices
03:21:55 <TheJollyRoger> But this is preferable to the app trying to reach those libraries, not finding them, not having any exception-handling capabilities, and then simply crashing.
03:22:19 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: I'd like to direct you to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for talk about Sailfish OS.
03:22:23 <chi00[m]> That makes sense.
03:22:45 <chi00[m]> Why does settings require Location access?
03:23:05 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: Yeah. This "stubbing out" of the Play Services API is meant to allow apps that are reliant on it to fail gracefully.
03:23:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger the stub makes the app think Google is offline> So THAT is how WhatsApp works on GOS. Cool beans.
03:23:39 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - not quite. At this moment the stub has only been proposed, it hasn't been implemented yet.
03:23:46 <hitchhooker[m]> whatsapp isnt dependant on google services?
03:23:56 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - what's very likely is that WhatsApp has been written to function in the absence of Google Play Services.
03:24:19 <TheJollyRoger> This requires more work on part of the app developers to do the functionality that Play Services normally provides all on their own. This is why a lot of app developers don't do it.
03:24:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Phew. I was scared for a moment there.
03:24:36 <TheJollyRoger> Since it's easier to simply just say "Hey google, do this" than have to do it all yourself.
03:24:45 <TheJollyRoger> At least, from the programmer's perspective.
03:25:06 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, developer time is a limited resource. There's only so many hours that the programmers have in the day.
03:26:43 <TheJollyRoger> After spending eight hours in front of my PC, I need a break, too.
03:26:56 <fierybinary[m]> Yes you do
03:27:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's why developer time is usually a limited resource... they need to eat, sleep, and enjoy life as well!
03:27:42 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: so I hope this clears things up for you on the subject of Google Play Services and GrapheneOS' stance on them.
03:28:14 <chi00[m]> yes
03:28:18 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
03:28:22 <chi00[m]> thx
03:28:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Though developers seem to think everyone has the most recent technology, and newer apps end up being slower on devices from people such as Venezuelans. At the time of Windows 95, our technology apparently was not enough to run it at a decent speed.
03:28:34 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run for a bit now, so I'll have to answer other questions at a later date.
03:28:55 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles ah, crap, I'm sorry to hear that, that is a really difficult problem.
03:28:56 <chi00[m]> you should document your answers and post them in an FAQ
03:29:40 <TheJollyRoger> chi00[m]: Well, the good news is, GrapheneOS actually has a very thoroughly curated FAQ page at https://grapheneos.org/faq . I may start having to blog about some of these things though, since I'm usually answering similar questions outside of it.
03:30:02 <TheJollyRoger> But I really have to go for the moment >_<.
03:30:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Lightweight (some people call it lean) programs sometimes end up being the solution. evilWM for example.See you later. It is sleep time over here for me.
03:31:07 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, sleep well shipmate.
03:31:55 <dewthedo[m]> new guy here. Just trying to find the link for getting past the "fastboot too old" error. I downloaded the latest version today, but still getting the error
03:32:14 <TheJollyRoger> Well, looks like farewell to my break. Ahoy dewthedo[m], welcome aboard.
03:32:29 <dewthedo[m]> Thanks!
03:32:32 <TheJollyRoger> dewthedo[m], have you tried our web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web ?
03:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> (Note that if adb is running, you will need to reboot your computer so ADB is not running before you try it, then unplug and replug in your phone so it detects properly.)
03:32:51 <dewthedo[m]> I have not. I'll check it out. Appreciate it
03:33:14 <TheJollyRoger> dewthedo[m]: Yarr, it makes it much easier to install, simply click the buttons as you are instructed to.
03:33:23 <dewthedo[m]> Ah, could be the pc reboot. I unplugged and replugged the phone, but didn't think of rebooting the pc
03:33:41 <TheJollyRoger> If you have Windows, you will likely want to use either Edge, Chrome, or Chromium for it, Gecko browsers (Tor Browser, Firefox, etc) aren't supported.
03:34:19 <TheJollyRoger> dewthedo[m]: yarr, if the ADB server is running it may conflict with the functionality used with fastboot.js and webUSB, and cause it to throw an error.
03:35:10 <dewthedo[m]> I'm using Brave browser right now, but will try via Chrome
03:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> dewthedo[m]: These days we don't recommend you use the Commandline Installer, due to many people finding the commandline installation too difficult, so there's a web installer that allows you to flash GrapheneOS from any computer with Chromium, Chrome, Edge, --
03:35:19 <dewthedo[m]> I was using this list to install originally https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
03:35:30 <dewthedo[m]> Makes sense
03:35:31 <TheJollyRoger> A few people have done it with Brave although Brave is not officially supported, so I can't in good faith recommend it.
03:35:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, the web installer is safer and easier.
03:35:59 <dewthedo[m]> Got it. I'll go with Chrome and use the web installer. Excited to use Graphene, tired of bloatware
03:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> The Commandline installation process is only offered for historical purposes or for people who already have the setup for it.
03:36:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, welcome aboard the ship!
03:36:51 <dewthedo[m]> Thanks again for the help
03:37:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ye be welcome!
03:37:40 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step away from the computer about uh...
03:37:45 * TheJollyRoger checks his watch.
03:38:06 <TheJollyRoger> About a few minutes ago, but I'll be back shortly. If you have any problems, you can usually ping me or ask in the channel, usually someone's here.
03:38:33 <TheJollyRoger> dewthedo[m], I'll just give you the quick heads-up in case you run into trouble while I'm not here:
03:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> If you find that the web installer can unlock your device, then download the factory image, but then when you try to flash, it simply hangs and nothing happens,
03:39:57 <TheJollyRoger> Generally what causes that is that either your USB firmware on your motherboard, or the USB slot is broken, or your USB cable is missing the trace (the wire) that fastboot.js or fastboot uses to access the interfaces on your phone to flash the slot.
03:40:26 <dewthedo[m]> Good to know
03:41:17 <TheJollyRoger> So if you have the google branded cable, use that, and if the USB slot is broken or the firmware support is hinky on your motherboard, occasionally, switching to a different port, turning the cable *upside down* (since USB-C is actually not bidirectional, some cables and some ports which side up or down matters) might fix it.
03:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> Avoid using Incognito mode for flashing GrapheneOS as well... what generally tends to happen is that if you are in Incognito mode, Chromium/Chrome/Edge will see that your downloaded files have reached over 800MB, and go "Hey, eight hundred megabytes, you ain't gonna need this" and start clearing the cache out before installation is done, resulting in it returning "Error: Unknown" to you.
03:43:30 <dewthedo[m]> Got it. Thanks for the tips
03:44:07 <TheJollyRoger> Once you're finished installing (wait for the phone to return you to fastboot, because on the "fastbootd" screen, data is being sent to the phone!), you can test boot your phone, then return to fastboot, but you *must* lock the bootloader so that a yellow "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen shows on first boot. If you see that, the bootloader is locked. If that screen
03:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> is orange and gives you something about "Software integrity is not guaranteed! Do not use!" then the bootloader's not locked and the installation's not finished.
03:45:02 <TheJollyRoger> Once you're done installing, you can return to developer options, disable OEM unlocking to reduce the attack surface, and then disable developer options, and pair with auditor at https://attestation.app/tutorial using the attestation server to verify the authenticity of the keys which will be doing verified boot.
03:45:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome!
03:45:44 <TheJollyRoger> If you find GrapheneOS useful, please sling us what ye can spare, at https://grapheneos.org/donate - donations keep this ship sailing, oo-arr!
03:46:18 <TheJollyRoger> I must away, shipmate, best of luck with yer voyage, we'll have ye sailing with us shortly!
03:46:22 <dewthedo[m]> Will do! I'm a big fan of supporting these efforts
03:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> Thank ye! P.-D
03:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ok gotta run now!
03:46:44 * TheJollyRoger grabs his hat and leaves a dustcloud.
03:46:45 <dewthedo[m]> Have a good one
03:48:21 <TheJollyRoger> Er, correction - I just realized, the yellow screen should show on every boot therafter. It's normal and expected behaviour.
03:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> I just realized that I said "first boot" so sorry if that caused any confusion! XP
03:57:03 <M647509735485097> Sorry if not appropriate channel, but does anyone have any privacy-respecting video editors they would recommend?

05:10:40 <strcat[m]> wasn't pinging you specifically
05:11:12 <KanYe[m]> Ah gotcha. Sorry but didn‚Äôt know that went down.
05:12:47 <strcat[m]> it's unfortunate that so many people are much more interested in causing harm to others than building anything good

05:15:31 <borges[m]> strcat: what's the recommended procedure for migrating from another android variant to GOS?
05:17:18 <strcat[m]> borges: don't really have specific recommendations, Seedvault is primarily for backing up / restoring on the same OS
05:17:36 <strcat[m]> you largely can't use it to migrate to another since it checks that the app id + signing key matches to avoid causing serious problems
05:17:57 <strcat[m]> borges: you can back up the Signal database and import it via Signal's encrypted backup
05:18:02 <strcat[m]> you can export and import things like contacts
05:18:17 <strcat[m]> you can back up and restore user files in user profile home directories multiple ways including apps like nextcloud
05:18:32 <borges[m]> Could you help me understand what you mean by "checks that the app id + signing key matches"?
05:18:42 <strcat[m]> Seedvault can do backup/restore for app data and the OS itself
05:19:23 <strcat[m]> borges: it won't restore data for the Phone app on GrapheneOS from a Phone app on another OS which isn't the same thing but rather different code with a potentially different data format that's incompatible
05:19:31 <strcat[m]> and the same for the rest of the OS apps, etc.
05:25:18 <borges[m]> Ah, I understand what you mean now, that seedvault checks that appid and signing key maches. I don't think this should be a problem because my understanding is that appid won't change and neither will signing key.
05:26:21 <borges[m]> Since seedvault uses the internal backup API, in theory it should be able to use Android Backups from adb on stock (with a format transformation)
05:31:45 <borges[m]> strcat: What I'm envisioning is a tool to convert an Android Backup from stock into Seedvault format to enable easier migration and hence making the transition smoother for new folks. How big of a barrier is lack of migration, that this could solve, to GOS gaining traction do you think?
05:32:23 <strcat[m]> borges: don't think it's a big barrier
05:32:34 <strcat[m]> the biggest barrier is we don't have an app install/update system yet
05:32:39 <strcat[m]> we need that implemented
05:32:44 <strcat[m]> and eSIM support / activation app
05:33:14 <borges[m]> What's the install/update system, like our own store?
05:35:25 <sphinx[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/94
05:35:42 <borges[m]> thanks sphinx
05:35:59 <strcat[m]> borges: yes
05:36:19 <strcat[m]> borges: very minimal and robust with automatic updates, delta updates, really simple signed metadata format with the whole thing signed
05:36:25 <strcat[m]> downgrade protection for metadata too, of course
05:36:55 <strcat[m]> borges: first party repo
05:37:08 <strcat[m]> borges: and then a page in the SetupWizard for checking boxes to install apps from there during setup
05:37:17 <strcat[m]> (in the background)
05:37:31 <strcat[m]> that's what we want as opposed to bundling apps in the OS

05:55:15 <gofigga[m]> Research "triangulation" for more info
07:24:07 <zzxx123_> Or use tinfoil wrap around your phone
08:22:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just use airplane mode
08:29:23 <TheJollyRoger> <voice="whiny toxic power user"> Airplane mode? But airplane mode's too eeeaaaaassy! </voice>
08:47:37 <pizzaeater69[m]> Remove sim card and only use wifi hotspots with tor/vpn
08:58:08 <TheJollyRoger> Something to bear in mind, is that phones without SIM cards are actually still capable of calling 911. If you would like to be off the Cellular network, the best thing you can do is switch on AirPlane mode, then switch WiFi back on. The code for WiFi and the Cellular radio is separately sandboxed, so you can use one radio, the other, both, or even neither.
09:00:28 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to "Cellphone triangulation" though, I'd like to point out a simple thought experiment: imagine writing a letter to your grandmother, put it in an unmarked envelope with neither return address, nor destination, put a stamp on it, and expecting it to arrive.
09:00:50 <TheJollyRoger> Your cellphone provider must know which towers to route to, if you're going to get your service.
09:01:34 <kradav[m]> wouldnt it be better to just leave it airplanemode, with no sim, no wifi, and use ethernet? [also, i know im not mod, but isnt this offtopic?]

09:02:44 <Mario75> Is anyone active on here?
09:02:50 <TheJollyRoger> All the ways you can access the internet, rely your device being able to route traffic to the next destination. If you decide to use ethernet, well,
09:03:02 <TheJollyRoger> your ISP has to know what house they're going to plug the wires into.
09:03:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Mario75, what can I do for you?
09:03:12 <Mario75> If so I have a question. Does Threema work on Graphene OS?
09:03:31 <Mario75> it's a paid messaging app, so will I have to login to get it?
09:03:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> It works
09:03:52 <TheJollyRoger> Mario75: I haven't used Threema before, unfortunately.
09:04:08 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you, @KileXt
09:04:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Login where ?
09:04:29 <Mario75> How do you download it GrapheneOS-Teleg? is it on the Aurora Store or something?
09:04:44 <Mario75> I'm new to this, My Pixel 4 XL comes in next week. I appreciate the help
09:04:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Buy it from them directly, like that google won't receive the 30% cut
09:05:11 <Mario75> how would I do that? I don't see it on their website
09:05:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> They provide the apk ones you pay for it
09:05:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> https://shop.threema.ch/
09:05:48 <TheJollyRoger> Mario75: Yarr, welcome aboard the ship in advance, future shipmate!
09:06:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Also the app has built in auto update so no aurora needed for it
09:06:19 <TheJollyRoger> You'll be able to install using the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web - just click the buttons and let her go, no additional software needed.
09:06:21 <Mario75> TheJollyRoger Pleasure :)
09:06:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Notification works, the app just check every 15min or more foressages
09:07:07 <TheJollyRoger> Arr~
09:07:12 <Mario75> Thank you for the information :)  that's good news Yarr haha
09:07:13 <CryptGoat[m]> I'd also recommend to get a Threema license from their store.
09:07:26 <Mario75> is their store on the website?
09:07:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> There
09:07:54 <TheJollyRoger> I must be off. Fare thee well, shipmates.
09:08:17 <Mario75> Ty for helping friend, don't sleep with the fishies ;)
09:08:47 <Mario75> GrapheneOS-Teleg if you sent a link all I saw was the word "There"
09:09:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Oh
09:09:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Well its the link from before
09:10:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I was just showing it was there
09:10:05 <Mario75> oop found it. ty
09:10:42 <Mario75> interesting...if I buy more than one license, will I be able to use it on my family's devices that are not flashed into GrapheneOS like mine?
09:10:57 <Mario75> or do I have to buy theirs through the playstore
09:12:21 <Mario75> Hye sliced
09:12:27 <Mario75> *hey woops haha
09:13:21 <Mario75> GrapheneOS-Teleg I found an answer to my question "Here you can purchase Threema for Android without going through the Google Play store. This shop is only intended for those users who cannot use Google Play."
09:15:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I think they write that only because of google 30% cut. They want to avoid what happened between apple and epic
09:21:23 <CryptGoat[m]> <Mario75 "or do I have to buy theirs throu"> You cann still buy and the licenses from the website AFAIK.
09:21:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Meh I'd buy from Google
09:21:32 <Mario75> GrapheneOS-Teleg What's the best thing about GrapheneOS that you have found out about?
09:21:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Imagine giving your debit card to threema
09:21:58 <Mario75> Lol I didn't they have a bitcoin option son
09:22:03 <Mario75> ohh yeahh
09:22:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mario75: use @KileXt
09:22:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Mario75 "Lol I didn't they have a bitcoin"> Okay then
09:22:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wait 1 week for them to confirm your payment
09:27:06 <vdge[m]> Btw, can app read unique sim ID even if it's in airplane mode if 'phone' permission is granted. I'm obviously assuming it can read device ID.
09:27:25 <vdge[m]> * Btw, can app read unique sim ID even if it's in airplane mode if 'phone' permission is granted? I'm obviously assuming it can read device ID.

09:31:23 <Mario75> I think so vdge[m]
09:37:37 <sad_plan[m]> Is there any difference between 4a and 4a 5g? I mean security wise, and possibly features if any at all. The price difference on them isnt too far apart on ebay, so if theres an advantage to buy one over the other, I see no reason not to buy the better. I know 5g would have longer support though. As its newer.
09:38:37 <Mario75> one is 4G and one is 5G. that's pretty much it as far as I know
09:40:43 <pizzaeater69[m]> Hardware wise 4a 5g is more like pixel5
09:40:43 <pizzaeater69[m]> And pixel4a is pixel4a :D
09:42:28 <sad_plan[m]> And what benefits does pixel 5 bring to the table that 4a does not have? I would buy a pixel 5 but I cant really live without the audio jack port tbh.
09:43:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Newer hardware
09:43:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Longer support
09:43:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Better security
09:43:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Newer kernels
09:43:42 <pizzaeater69[m]> Right
09:47:34 <Mario75> is there an easy tool to migrate all data if our phones get outdated? example, I have a Pixel 4 XL and If they announce a newer lineup of phones like a Pixel 5 XL or 6, do we just save a device image and load it on the new OS? or would we have to manually do it app by app and setting by setting again?

09:48:34 <strcat> Mario75: manually backing up each user profile's home directory, manually backing up apps implementing their own (encrypted) backup like Signal
09:48:34 <Mario75> Seedvault...interesting....never heard of it. Looking into it now
09:48:39 <strcat> it's included in the OS
09:48:43 <Mario75> oh awesome
09:49:03 <Mario75> okay, what's the expected EOL for a Pixel 4 XL? like 3 years?
09:49:16 <Mario75> came out in oct 2019
09:49:39 <Mario75> most EOL or EOS is 5 years
09:54:54 <gofam[m]> hello
09:55:08 <pizzaeater69[m]> Hi
09:56:10 <sad_plan[m]> anupritaisno1[m]: could you be more specific about security? I mean, if theres any specifics at all than just better implentations of already implementet features.
09:56:23 <gofam[m]> im a bit confused, GrapheneOS uses google pixel, google probably knows about graphene, why wouldn't google just add a secret hardware which is specifically for grapheneos?
09:57:45 <rny> gofam[m]: google will be really busy supporting all these other android variants :/
09:57:58 <xrm33[m]> I really like the OS! Is it still being developed BTW? Will there be more used friendly updates like themes, which will make it more mainstream?
09:57:59 <rny> google is not in the business of giving out free lunches.
09:58:15 <rny> xrm33[m]: it is still being developed.
09:58:40 <xrm33[m]> Awesome!

10:29:38 <gobanana1> so what is this channel for?
10:30:03 <gobanana1> i mean its for talking about grapheneos...
10:30:45 <strcat[m]> it's not for uninformed theorizing and conspiracy theories
10:30:57 <strcat[m]> it's not productive to come here and talk about how you think China backdoored some component made there, or whatever

10:35:08 <gobanana1> thanks
10:37:23 <strcat[m]> I also think you might be confused about the purpose of GrapheneOS
10:37:35 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/ and https://grapheneos.org/features are important content
10:38:08 <strcat[m]> the purpose of GrapheneOS is to provide a very secure and private mobile OS for the best available devices which will change over time
10:38:25 <strcat[m]> and the intention is to work with companies to produce better devices for it
10:39:03 <strcat[m]> the purpose of GrapheneOS is not avoiding Google services, we wouldn't include other kinds of proprietary services baked in the OS either
10:39:35 <strcat[m]> it's a privacy and security project
10:41:11 <strcat[m]> the security and supply chain of hardware and firmware will always matter regardless of which devices are officially supported
10:41:28 <strcat[m]> the devices are chosen based on their privacy and security properties
10:42:25 <strcat[m]> there's no point in presenting your conspiracy theories and grievances against some specific company, such as say, Sony, and claiming that they must be putting a backdoor in the camera sensors, etc.
10:42:38 <strcat[m]> that kind of speculation, etc. isn't appropriate for the channel
10:43:22 <strcat[m]> discussion should be constructive and informed by facts, no point of doing things that are basically concern trolling

12:54:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hi
12:56:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> I have been graphene since yesterday and am surprised what is possible.  but have a few more questions.  is it possible to get a remote wipe function on the cell phone that can be reset remotely?  and why can I not install telegram in other profiles, but in the Armin profile?
12:57:28 <strcat[m]> you can install it on any profile
12:57:40 <strcat[m]> sounds like you're trying to install an older version on the other profiles than what you have in the main one
12:57:51 <strcat[m]> remote wipe via device admin works fine, don't recommend it though
12:57:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Probably one of the few apps that are broken maybe
12:58:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll take a look at it
12:58:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might be a similar case to termux
13:07:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> I've checked it again.  it's the same version.  it always comes the APP was not installed
13:08:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah well that's something you need to fix yourself
13:08:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Tigeroz> Do you have a link with a tutorial?

13:12:27 <strcat[m]> leaking from renderer process is not a security vulnerability in the Chromium model

13:59:44 <Milanche> thanks!
14:08:10 <rawtaz> not sure if this is on topic or not, but im curious if anyone here isnt a core developer for grapheneos, yet does fiddle with it a bit and builds and runs their own variant of it?
14:08:45 <strcat[m]> a decent number of people make their own builds
14:09:03 <rawtaz> cool. whats the most common use case for htat, i mean what do they modify and change?
14:09:15 <rawtaz> an obvious use case would be to make everything punk, but im sure there are others
14:09:21 <rawtaz> pink*
14:17:50 <strcat> rawtaz: I think the most common use case is just to have their own builds with their own keys, and in the case of some companies they brand it and sell phones with it
14:17:56 <strcat> bundle apps
14:19:16 <Rudd-O[m]> I know I myself would like to run my own builds like I did with rattlesnake back in the day.
14:19:35 <Rudd-O[m]> It's just that care and feeding the build server got to be almost a part time job.
14:19:42 <strcat[m]> and of course people who want to contribute will often be doing that
14:24:50 <rawtaz> interesting. what keys is that, something that signs the entire OS and this is what the bootloader then checks, so that if something would be fiddled with on the phone after one's installing it, this will be detected and refused to boot?
14:32:34 <strcat[m]> there are multiple signing keys
14:32:46 <strcat[m]> the OS is totally verified from the verified boot key
14:32:55 <strcat[m]> there's a chain of trust from low-level hardware through to the OS
14:33:05 <strcat[m]> for an alternate OS it uses the verified boot key flashed to the secure element
14:33:54 <strcat[m]> verified boot also performs downgrade protection, it has a 'rollback index' (typically the integer representing the security patch level) in the secure element and prevents downgrades
14:34:11 <strcat[m]> updates are similarly signed + have downgrade protection (typically based on build date)
14:34:34 <strcat[m]> and apps / APEX components are signed (since they can be updated out of band)
14:34:49 <strcat[m]> and signing keys are part of how the app security model works
14:35:25 <strcat[m]> low-level permissions (non-user-facing) can be designed to be granted based on signatures, it's a big part of how apps inside and outside the OS do secure interprocess communication
14:35:25 <rawtaz> right, lots of security levels there
14:36:05 <rawtaz> but which keys is it that people usually want to tweak?
14:36:11 <strcat[m]> so for example if you have an app where you have themes / plugins shipped as other apps you would have a signature check potentially via a signature permission or similar check
14:36:17 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: they don't tweak them
14:36:26 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: if you have your own builds, you have your own signing keys
14:36:58 <rawtaz> yeah, thats what i mean
14:37:56 <strcat[m]> I mean you inherently have to have your own
14:37:57 <rawtaz> but they do this in order to make sure that what the system verifies and allows to run is *their own* stuff, even if the default stuff would be the ones from the grapheneos project
14:38:01 <rawtaz> yeah
14:38:15 <strcat[m]> you don't have the GrapheneOS private keys, they're kept on a local GrapheneOS signing machine
14:38:20 <strcat[m]> you can't sign stuff as that
14:38:33 <strcat[m]> and your own signing keys would similarly just be yours
14:38:34 <rawtaz> yes, of course
14:38:44 <rawtaz> im just trying to understand *why* they want to do all this
14:38:45 <strcat[m]> well I don't quite know what you mean
14:38:58 <rawtaz> let me put it this way;
14:38:59 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: well if they don't want to trust our builds but rather have their own
14:39:04 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: or if they want to make any modifications
14:39:34 <rawtaz> even if they go through all the hassle of building this themselves, to get their own keys in there, its in a way pretty pointless unless they actually audit the code they build, no?
14:39:50 <rawtaz> yeah, modifications is a given, then you have to do it

16:33:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> The Firefox you get from the Debian APT repos
16:43:16 <dazinism> gochoingles: will not work with Firefox. Not sure about 32bit OS. Possibly? Ideally need a up to date chromium (or fork)
16:44:03 <dazinism> qubits: I think all the MDM stuff is intact and functional.
16:44:21 <dazinism> Except any parts that rely on Play Store
16:45:46 <dazinism> I think most MDM services use Google push for communicating with phones they are managing
16:46:52 <dazinism> Possibly they don't have to, but it's difficult to do otherwise.
16:47:03 <dazinism> So most just use Play
16:58:57 <dazinism> Looks like its the same issue as with some messengers. The MDM app would need its own push service
16:59:31 <dazinism> Due to the fact most devices have Play, most MDM apps havent bothered developing their own push.
16:59:35 <dazinism> https://github.com/flyve-mdm/android-mdm-agent/issues/795
17:10:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> dazinism: So there is support for x64?What repo should I use for Chromium?
17:17:15 <strcat> just use the normal debian chromium package
17:17:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H‚Äãandyberlin> Is it allowed to program GrapheneOS? Regards
17:17:36 <strcat> GrapheneOS is open source
17:22:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> That means "yes".
17:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles if I recall right Firefox does not implement WebUSB the way Chromium does. You'll have to use Chromium. You should be fine. You got your phone?
17:57:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !K has joined the Telegram Group!
18:10:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !abjectmusic has joined the Telegram Group!
18:19:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!K> Why GrapheneOS only avaible for Google devices?
18:21:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Apparently Google Pixels have a really well implemented Verified Boot.
18:34:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> This is clearly explained on the website.
18:35:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
18:57:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!K> So it's not possible for other devices? Or just harder to make?
19:13:20 <TheJollyRoger> @!K - not possible. Other vendors are hostile to it and will actually fail to support or even go out of their way to disable many of the bootloader security features that GrapheneOS depends on.
19:16:31 <TheJollyRoger> @!K - only Google has been welcoming of and offering full hardware support and full hardware security features for non-Google operating systems. Other vendors will only allow you to run non-vendor operating systems without verified boot, which leaves you with a device that has pre-2012 era security, and that means no verified boot, hardware backed keying, with no hardware backed keystore, and
19:16:33 <TheJollyRoger> no remote attestation nor verification of the bootloader keying and verified boot hash.
19:17:32 * TheJollyRoger heads off.
19:17:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!K> Thats sad
19:17:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!K> Thanks for the information
19:23:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, ye be welcome!
19:26:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://9to5google.com/2021/03/14/google-pixel-daylight-saving-time/
19:26:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> upstream bug, not really our fault
19:33:04 <dazinism> Actually OnePlus do try to do verified boot. Just they mess it up all the time.
19:33:40 <dazinism> Think on all their devices security implementation has been poor with loads of serious holes
19:34:44 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: did they ever properly fix the verified boot for other devices on the OP7pro
19:35:12 <dazinism> Sorry not devices.....operating systems
19:35:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dazinism "anupritaisno1: did they ever pro"> it's oneplus, make your own assumptions
19:35:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> we are literally talking about a company that ignores cves filed by security companies
19:35:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> what are you expecting?
19:36:25 <dazinism> You were thinking they may have fixed that for the OP7pro
19:36:38 <dazinism> But guess also maybe not....
19:36:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017007
19:48:13 <vdge[m]> Haha, reminds me of Kenzo days when I felt happy to flash TWRP without unlocking bootloaderüòÖ Didn't realize it was a crticial vulnerability back in the day. You can literally flash whatever fuck you want without unlocking bootloader on this device btw.

19:53:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!K> Maybe someone can explain me how to flash lineageos andriod 10 or 11 GSI one my device
19:53:59 <vdge[m]> * To this date, I didn't unlock the bootloader of kenzo but it's rocking android 10 rom in selinux permissive mode lying in my shelf! RIP

19:54:12 <louipc> try a lineageos channel
19:54:20 <vdge[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!K> Maybe someone can explain m"> This is official channel...Switch to OT at least
19:58:19 <skagreek[m]> Has Seedvault always auto-started the backup when a USB is inserted or just recently? Can't recall. I'm on RQ2A.210305.006.2021.03.06.00
19:59:23 <skagreek[m]> Once inserted, it does a backup failed, initially, then starts a running backup successfully.
20:07:21 <skagreek[m]> It didn't auto-start the backup when i inserted the 2nd time within 5 minutes. Since I only backup once a day, maybe it automated after 24 hours or when major changes occurred. But it was definitely automated upon insertion of usb.
20:12:15 <thumper54> Hi,¬†¬† waiting for stimulus money, to purchase google pixel.¬† which I plan to purchase directly from google store,¬† Question is,¬† after I get phone, I update it.¬†¬† do I put a Sim Card in it and get a number set up,
20:12:36 <thumper54> Or do I install grapheneos first
20:12:44 <thumper54> or does it matter?
20:12:56 <b1101> don't think it does
20:13:10 <b1101> you going to use tmobile?
20:13:17 <thumper54> no
20:13:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I don't know if it matters in any way.  I didn't insert a sim card first.
20:13:47 <thumper54> I have been using an Iphone 6S plus with straight talk version which does CDMA
20:14:02 <thumper54> as that works well in this area.¬† GSM¬†¬† Not so well
20:14:24 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I didn't log into any google account but the phone did require me to connect to a network at least one time before allowing me to unlock the OEM switch.
20:15:00 <thumper54> I intend,¬†¬† to say,¬†¬† GSM works very poorly here.
20:15:09 <skagreek[m]> Same here. I had to connect to wifi for it to allow OEM unlock.
20:15:28 <thumper54> hmm.¬†¬† Good to know.
20:16:26 <thumper54> I could ask "Straight Talk" to do whatever is required to move SIM card over, or I could buy another, and later move number over.
20:16:46 <thumper54> which is likely to be easier.
20:19:35 <thumper54> I guess it is not important.¬†¬† I can not put graphene on it until I use it once.¬†¬† I should just prepare myself to¬† use android for two or three days to see how well connection works
20:20:29 <skagreek[m]> which pixel are you getting?
20:20:39 <thumper54> any other warnings before I get phone.¬†¬†¬† It is likely to work on CDMA¬†¬† likely verizon substitute
20:20:43 <skagreek[m]> Been using the 4a 5G for a while and it's really good.
20:21:38 <thumper54> Pixel 4A 5 G,¬†¬† which will not do verizon 5G, but this area does not have 5g, and I am thinking I want the later phone as updates will go on longer
20:22:42 <thumper54> Also, one of the things I do with phone, is watch Amazon Prime Video.¬†¬† not very secure.¬†¬† but 4A 5g has a slightly larger screen.
20:23:17 <thumper54> I hope graphene has a good screen driver.¬†¬† I am not a fan of Android,¬† and am becoming less a fan of Apple
20:27:05 <skagreek[m]> I left apple after a long time (very early 80's user here). You'll like the 4a5G screen, excellent graphics. It's just going to take some time to get used to non-iOS and everyone and their mother being in iMessage and refusing to add signal.
20:27:24 <skagreek[m]>  * I left apple after a long time (very early 80's user here). You'll like the 4a5G screen, excellent graphics. It's just going to take some time to get used to non-iOS and everyone and their mother being in iMessege and refusing to add signal.

20:28:40 <skagreek[m]> I'll add my opinion in off topic for the reason i became an apple hater, don't want to waste space here.
20:29:00 <skagreek[m]> Maybe i better just be quiet. /end
20:29:40 <thumper54> well, I am glad to hear that the screen is excellent.¬†¬† This is a big bit of money for me.¬† hate to make a mistake
20:29:52 <thumper54> can one do messages besides Signal.
20:30:00 <thumper54> I had not looked.
20:30:07 <skagreek[m]> you'll be happy. I really like it. Yeah, i guess regular texting.
20:30:29 <thumper54> I have not found anyone else who would install signal
20:30:47 <thumper54> so I would have to give up texting
20:31:49 <skagreek[m]> yeah, only got 2 friends on signal. one is a long time android user, and the 2nd is a new GOS user.  Yeah, I tell people to email me if you don't to text in signal. Great way to avoid wasting time on useless conversations. ha
20:32:10 <skagreek[m]>  * yeah, only got 2 friends on signal. one is a long time android user, and the 2nd is a new GOS user.  Yeah, I tell people to email me if you don't want to text in signal. Great way to avoid wasting time on useless conversations. ha
20:34:26 <thumper54> I guess in one sense I agree with you.¬†¬† but I live in a country place, and most here are luddites.¬†¬† and txting is part of the pandemic for old people like me
20:34:43 <azahi> I'm trying to install grapheneos on pixel 4a. currently stuck on a "./flash-all.sh" part because the `fastboot flash bootloader blah-blah.img` command doesn't appear to do anything, it just sits idle without outputing anything. htop shows the process as "D", which I guess stands for "wait for the disk".
20:34:49 <azahi> I'm on opensuse
20:35:28 <azahi> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
20:40:11 <skagreek[m]> thumper54: Funny, use of the word luddites!
20:41:35 <thumper54> prefer no technology
20:42:03 <skagreek[m]> You over 50? I'm 50 here. Thought I was oldest here.
20:42:47 <billinmtl[m]> I'm over 50 - what's the reference ?
20:43:18 <thumper54> The Luddites were a secret oath-based organisation[1] of English textile workers in the 19th century, a radical faction which destroyed textile machinery as a form of protest. The group are believed to have taken their name from Ned Ludd, a weaver from Anstey, near Leicester. They protested against manufacturers who used machines in what they
20:43:19 <thumper54> called "a fraudulent and deceitful manner" to get around standard labour practices.[2] Luddites feared that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste, as machines would replace their role in the industry.[3] Many Luddites were owners of workshops that had closed because factories could sell the same products for less.
20:43:33 <thumper54> I am 71
20:43:58 <skagreek[m]> Yeah, i read that too. Man, 71 is amazing!
20:45:11 <thumper54> I have spend a year corona hiding.¬† I have five co morbities.¬† I am 71, had open heart surgery in 2001, diabetes, kidney disease, and I weigh too much
20:46:55 <skagreek[m]> WOW, awesome! Wishing you great health. You seem like you've survived a lot that's been thrown at you. OK i better not keep typing here since it's all off topic.
20:47:04 <thumper54> good bye
20:47:04 <akc3n[m]> There is  #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for offtopic discussions unrelated to GrapheneOS.
20:49:19 <akc3n[m]> <azahi "I'm trying to install grapheneos"> What kind of USB cable are you using?
20:51:47 <akc3n[m]> azahi:  when you did fastboot --version, what did it list as the installed directory?
20:53:46 <azahi> USB 3.0 to type C
20:54:01 <azahi> I straced the execution https://0x0.st/-ZCQ.log
20:54:11 <azahi> apparently the libraries aren't loaded correctly
20:54:33 <azahi> not sure how to approach this now
20:55:22 <azahi> akc3n[m]: Installed as /root/graphene/platform-tools/fastboot
21:03:52 <akc3n[m]> azahi:  also have a read of a previous discussion from the other day, it may help you out.

21:12:33 <azahi> ok, gonna try the web installer
21:12:43 <azahi> had to download chromium for that
21:20:10 <skagreek[m]> All this talk about proper cables is accurate. I can vouch for that.
21:21:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Is Yoobao a decent cable brand, for flashing GOS?
21:32:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I‚Äãickhitterextraordinaire> That just sounds like some Amazon cheapo brand
21:33:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I‚Äãickhitterextraordinaire> I think Anker is good for a third party cable
21:33:45 <skagreek[m]> Nothing to do with facts, but i noticed the thicker cables were more successful than the thinner cables. This is from a guy who has gone back and forth from stock OS to GOS at least 50 times.
21:35:06 <skagreek[m]> The most solid installs were using a 6 inch USBC to USBC on a macbook. Not one issue.
21:45:04 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Even different ports on the same computer can make a difference.  One USB C port completely failed to install every time with three attempts. The other installed first try.
21:45:39 <skagreek[m]> yeah, weird how that is.
21:46:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Now hunting for an Anker.
21:47:19 <skagreek[m]> Also noticed the USB A to C cables and adapters were hit or miss.
21:51:11 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I was pretty fortunate in that a USB A cable with an Anker adapter worked for all the phones I tried it with until I got an actual 4a with an actual google supplied cable.  But there's really no telling.
21:52:04 <skagreek[m]> Of all the things I tried, I never tried the stock cable yet. lol
21:52:13 <skagreek[m]>  * Of all the things I tried, I never tried the stock cable yet.
22:34:28 <Firdeus> Hello, i try to install grapheneos to Google Pixel 5, from Web Install. I have this error message: Error: Bootloader replied with FAIL: Fastboot: Invalid command update-super:super:wipe
22:35:57 <Firdeus> Can you help me please ?
22:41:26 <mynacol[m]> Firdeus: Sounds to me like you messed around with the phone while the installation was running
22:41:36 <mynacol[m]> Or maybe a USB problem
22:43:42 <albert88[m]> When I use only a secondary account for two/three days it happens that sometimes I get the main account back after unlocking the screen. Is it normal that sometimes the operating system "reverts" to the main account if you use secondary accounts for too long? And above all, when I find myself in the main account instead of the secondary account I was using, does the session end? Or does the operating system change
22:43:42 <albert88[m]> accounts without terminating the session?
22:47:47 <Firdeus> Thank you nacol, i dont use the original cable, i have usb-c to usb
