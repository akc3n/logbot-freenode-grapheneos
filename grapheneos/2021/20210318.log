00:09:59 <soulwarrior888[m> Hey all happy to be here
00:10:02 <soulwarrior888[m> does anyone use the App Wire
00:10:07 <soulwarrior888[m> on Graphene
00:10:36 <soulwarrior888[m> I am having issues receiving notifications from Wire
00:19:19 <princemachiavell> soulwarrior888 Any app that uses Google push notifications won't have notifications on GrapheneOS.
00:22:31 <gochoingles[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "I think TJR has turned in for to"> Taking a kip, I imagine.
00:22:53 <verolom[m]> princemachiavelli: do you know if signal and protonmail are not using google push notifications?
00:27:33 <akc3n[m]> verolom Signal notifications work. Protonmail notifications do not work.

00:45:00 <soulwarrior888[m> Tinfoil Enthusiast: from what I understand MicroG cannot be configured with Graphene OS
00:45:36 <soulwarrior888[m> princemachiavelli: thanks, looks like I have to find another app to use talk with family
00:47:24 <TinfoilEnthusias> Oh no not microG, I’m just trying to understand how the minimal Play services would work.
00:48:15 <soulwarrior888[m> Tinfoil Enthusiast: it looks like Graphene Os Devs are working on a minimal play services app
00:48:18 <gochoingles[m]> Is it normal that Matrix messages in general delay?
00:48:44 <gochoingles[m]> Or is it the instance's fault?
00:49:09 <gochoingles[m]> Oops, sorry. Off-topic. If anyone replies to this, reply in the OT chat.
00:49:09 <soulwarrior888[m> what app do folks use to chat with friends and family. need something secure with voice. I don't like Signal or Telegram.
00:49:12 <dannyknoll3Danny> <gochoingles[m] "Or is it the instance's fault?"> This
00:49:27 <TinfoilEnthusias> <soulwarrior888[m "Tinfoil Enthusiast: it looks lik"> Right but by the way it’s described, it looks like it’s just a way to trick apps into believing the servers are down. I’m just wondering what that achieves for apps that use play services, for notifications as an example.
00:49:29 <dannyknoll3Danny> soulwarrior888: Conversations has been mentioned here
00:49:40 <dannyknoll3Danny> Can't imagine what's wrong with Signal, certainly can't be the UX
00:50:01 <soulwarrior888[m> I don't like that it asks for a phone numbrer
00:50:09 <dannyknoll3Danny> Tinfoil Enthusiast: just the basic ability to open and use the app.
00:50:19 <dannyknoll3Danny> soulwarrior888: So use a fake one first registration, I did.
00:50:38 <TinfoilEnthusias> <dannyknoll3Danny "Tinfoil Enthusiast: just the bas"> Ah. So notifications wouldn’t actually work?
00:50:58 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> Session is OK as well. Not sure if it will work on Graphene with notifications, but give it a try.
00:51:28 <dannyknoll3Danny> Unless app has a non Google notification library as fallback
00:51:42 <TinfoilEnthusias> <dannyknoll3Danny "Can't imagine what's wrong with "> I think Signal has a ton of issues, but to their credit they’re the only decent messenger to be widely adopted.
00:52:34 <TinfoilEnthusias> But I hate that they require a phone number for seemingly no reason. I don’t like centralized services in general, especially ones based in bad jurisdictions like the US.
00:52:57 <soulwarrior888[m> Tinfoil Enthusiast: haha true on the US
00:53:00 <skwisgaar[m]> Nothing is as secure as signal atm. Other encrypted messengers leak way more metadata and have issues with their encryption.
00:53:36 <TinfoilEnthusias> <skwisgaar[m] "Nothing is as secure as signal a"> I heard Tinfoil Chat was pretty good but I never looked into the specifics.
00:53:38 <dannyknoll3Danny> <TinfoilEnthusias "But I hate that they require a p"> Easy Contact discovery for grandma = network effect = more people communicating encrypted
00:53:42 <skwisgaar[m]> Everything has tradeoffs unfortunately
00:53:47 <dannyknoll3Danny> Net win, bad battle lost
00:54:07 <soulwarrior888[m> XMPP using conversations is pretty good too
00:54:07 <dannyknoll3Danny> Steps, grasshopper ☺
00:54:34 <TinfoilEnthusias> <dannyknoll3Danny "Easy Contact discovery for grand"> Oh no I get why they’d ask for a phone number for that reason, but they should allow people who require anonymity to sign up without one.
00:55:06 <skwisgaar[m]> If you do searches for any other secure messengers, you can find str cat criticizing them with technical explanations. Wire, xmpp, session, etc.
00:55:12 <skwisgaar[m]> Never believe marketing
00:55:14 <TinfoilEnthusias> <soulwarrior888[m "XMPP using conversations is pret"> Nah I’ve heard it’s got tons of issues with metadata and XMPP clients themselves being kinda trash with security.
00:55:15 <skwisgaar[m]> Ever
00:55:57 <skwisgaar[m]> Actually I’m not sure about session, but you get the idea
00:57:28 <dannyknoll3Danny> <TinfoilEnthusias "Oh no I get why they’d ask for a"> Right, but then grandma has 3 contacts instead of 30, and she uninstalls
00:57:37 <dannyknoll3Danny> Defaults Matter™
00:58:26 <skwisgaar[m]> Yeah signal doesn’t want to make some niche app for privacy-focused people, they want “regular” people to actually use the app
00:58:41 <TinfoilEnthusias> <dannyknoll3Danny "Defaults Matter™"> Fair point.
00:59:21 <TinfoilEnthusias> <skwisgaar[m] "Actually I’m not sure about sess"> I believe Session modifies the Signal protocol to be decentralized and anonymous, but I do not believe it’s been formally verified.
00:59:37 <TinfoilEnthusias> * > <@skwisgaar:matrix.org> Actually I’m not sure about session, but you get the idea
00:59:37 <TinfoilEnthusias> I believe Session modifies the Signal protocol to be decentralized and anonymous, but I don’t think it’s been formally verified.
01:00:44 <akc3n[m]> <TinfoilEnthusias "> <@akc3n:tchncs.de> verolom Sig"> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/204
01:00:48 <skwisgaar[m]> Tinfoil Enthusiast: the signal protocol is quite good so that’s an interesting option for sure. Whether it’s implemented correctly/maintained properly is the question.
01:01:08 <skwisgaar[m]> And I am not smart enough to figure that out lol
01:02:42 <princemachiavell> <skwisgaar[m] "Tinfoil Enthusiast: the signal p"> Matrix/element should be as good if not better than Signal since the server is open source and supports verifying sessions.
01:04:56 <TinfoilEnthusias> <princemachiavell "Matrix/element should be as good"> Signal’s server is also open source, and they also support verification.
01:05:14 <skwisgaar[m]> Matrix encryption leaks way more metadata than signal unfortunately
01:05:32 <skwisgaar[m]> The security is really not comparable
01:05:54 <TinfoilEnthusias> <skwisgaar[m] "The security is really not compa"> The security is probably fine, the issue is privacy.
01:06:21 <princemachiavell> It has way more metadata to leak since it's way than just a chat protocol. If you run your own instance it's probably less bad.
01:06:44 <skwisgaar[m]> If the encryption was implemented properly it might be comparable, but that’s not the case as I understand it
01:06:55 <jpds> This is a conversation for #grapheneos-offtopic
01:07:13 <skwisgaar[m]> Oh didn’t realize what chat this was lol thanks
01:07:13 <dannyknoll3Danny> > <@serpantsauce:matrix.org> Signal’s server is also open source, and they also support verification.
01:07:13 <dannyknoll3Danny> > I don’t know if Matrix has equally secure encryption as Signal, that seems like it’d be very hard to do with the way it’s used. Not to mention all the metadata leaks.
01:07:13 <dannyknoll3Danny> Used to be
01:07:56 <soulwarrior888[m> the thing with signal is though if I don't have any contacts in my phone I cannot connect with anyone
01:08:06 <princemachiavell> Also, since element has notifications it is a good way to bridge any service/app that doesn't on Graphene.
01:09:36 <skwisgaar[m]> Should continue this in OT chat
01:09:52 <dannyknoll3Danny> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
01:10:01 <akc3n[m]> As per rule 2 https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
01:24:43 <uhsa> hello, i have succesfully installed graphene os and i would like to verify my installation but i have a hard time understanding the process. If i understand correctly i would need a different device and it doesnt have to be a graphene os device, unfortunately i dont have any of the devices on the supported devices tab. Would it be possible to do it
01:24:43 <uhsa> with just my pixel 4a graphene os device?
01:30:31 <louipc> uhsa: you can use the website https://attestation.app/
01:32:30 <uhsa> i am currently on the website i cant find where it says how to do it through the website
01:32:55 <uhsa> or would i have to visit the website on my graphe os device
01:33:18 <akc3n[m]> <uhsa "i am currently on the website i "> https://attestation.app/tutorial#scheduled-remote-verification
01:39:16 <uhsa> im sorry but how would i use the website to verify would i still need an extra android device next to my pixel graphene to verify?
01:55:17 <uhsa> i understand now how to do it, once my device has been verified do i have to do it again or only this once after installation and before connecting to internet? And once my pixel is verified can i then use it as an auditor for the next device with graphene os?
01:56:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> The two last are correct AFAIK.
02:09:58 <Naptune> Hey, I was considering getting a Pixel and using GrapheneOS but had some questions. So far it seems like most apps I currently use will still work or have alternatives, but I'm unsure about YouTube. Currently I use YouTube Vanced, would installing Micro G allow me to continue using it on Graphene?
02:13:49 <akc3n[m]> <Naptune "Hey, I was considering getting a"> Hi Naptune GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another implementation of Google services like microG.
02:14:17 <Naptune> Am I able to install it myself while using Graphene?
02:16:52 <akc3n[m]> Using Vanadium Browser, you are able to view YouTube videos.
02:16:52 <akc3n[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
02:16:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Naptune: For such a thing you need root. However, if you want to keep security and still be able to watch videos in YouTube, I would suggest you to get NewPipe.
02:18:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Naptune: You could also try Vanadium on Invidious instances.
02:18:20 <Naptune> Yeah I heard about Newpipe, but from what I could tell you can't really use the functionality of a YouTube account like making playlists. I'll definitely take a look at Vanadium or Invidious
02:18:23 <skwisgaar[m]> Naptune: you cannot install microg on GrapheneOS
02:18:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Naptune: GrapheneOS will not officially support root, it reduces security.
02:19:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Naptune: Then you could sign in YouTube in Vanadium — Invidious does not support signing in accounts.
02:19:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> *log into
02:20:03 <Naptune> Sounds good, thank you!
02:20:53 <akc3n[m]> Naptune:  is this what you are referring to when you say youtube vanced? https://vancedapp.com/
02:21:20 <Naptune> Yes that's it
02:21:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Remember you get more privacy by not using a Google account.
02:21:57 <akc3n[m]> <Naptune "Yes that's it"> The download link opens an apk for downloading/installation.
02:23:10 <Naptune> The download installs a manager which installs microg and the vanced app for you, which from the sounds of it wouldn't work with Graphene
02:23:28 <akc3n[m]> Naptune:  check out #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org as well, if you more questions about apps, etc.
02:23:56 <akc3n[m]> <Naptune "The download installs a manager "> Ahh, I see.... Okay. Sorry about that. My bad.
02:23:59 <Naptune> And I'm okay with using a few google services for the sake of convenience, I just want to avoid the system wide privacy invasion
02:24:30 <sphinx[m]> they are on freenode, so #grapheneos-offtopic
02:26:38 <Dylanger[m]> <Naptune "The download installs a manager "> Vanced works fine on Graphene
02:30:44 <KanYe[m]> How long should I expect the Pixel 4a to be supported ? Late 2023-early 2024 ?
02:43:46 <poisonoushydra[m> <KanYe[m] "How long should I expect the Pix"> https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
02:45:30 <redbeard72> Wow darn, I was hoping to get 10 years out of it :)
02:46:44 <KanYe[m]> Well. I mean it is going to last me through a fair bit of college, but after that time, maybe I can get myself the Pixel 7a or whatever Google planning on calling it, or I could get the Pinephone, assuming the software/development space is already polished.
02:56:31 <uhsa> i just installed graphene os is there a guide on how to proceed i read somewhere installing f-droid would be the next best step where can i find it?
02:58:01 <uhsa> and when i try to open the log malwarebytes blocks the url saying trojan
02:59:33 <sphinx[m]> uhsa: just use Vanadium to do it
03:01:02 <verolom[m]> <redbeard72 "Wow darn, I was hoping to get 10"> I got 8 years+ out of my galaxy s4, about to trade it in for a pixel 4a 5g on friday :)
03:02:05 <redbeard72> verolom[m]: very good. Looks like I won't be able to do the same thing running Graphene the whole time though :)
03:02:39 <uhsa> thank you how can i reply to a user in the webbrowser chat
03:02:49 <verolom[m]> <redbeard72 "verolom: very good. Looks like I"> Just compile it yourself, it's what I was doing with lineage/cyanogen when they dropped my model/carrier for a time. :P
03:03:28 <redbeard72> verolom[m]: are there graphene tutorials for that?
03:04:28 <verolom[m]> <redbeard72 "verolom: are there graphene tuto"> of course! https://grapheneos.org/build
03:06:52 <redbeard72> Cool.
03:12:29 <Thatcher[m]> <verolom[m] "I got 8 years+ out of my galaxy "> You can trade in an s4 for a 4a 5g?
03:12:57 <uhsa> i would like to install a second messenger besides signal what would you recommend? i couldnt find an apk file for wickr on their website
03:13:17 <verolom[m]> Thatcher: I was using figure of speech, no of course they won't take it, but I won't use it as my main device. Thinking of turning it into a mobile security system :D
03:14:24 <sphinx[m]> uhsa: you can use Aurora Store to download apps from Play Store, it's on F-Droid too
03:15:30 <verolom[m]> Does anyone use any sort of an app that has functionality like google auto? Does it work with GOS? Navigation too?
03:17:27 <Thatcher[m]> <uhsa "i would like to install a second"> I recommend Threema. It costs $3 but it's awesome. They have a standalone apk on their site. Lots of people don't like the $3 part.
03:18:23 <uhsa> sphinx[m] does aurora store decrease privacy by using playstore apps? i would also like to download nordvpn if it isnt in f-droid
03:19:26 <zzxx123_> Aurora is just a play store front end
03:19:32 <Thatcher[m]> uhsa you can download openvpn or wireguard client and use nordvpn through those clients
03:19:41 <zzxx123_> ^
03:20:04 <Thatcher[m]> Btw, wireguard is baked into the kernel in android 12
03:20:16 <verolom[m]> Highly recommend wireguard instead of openvpn, especially if you have a newer phone with a newer kernel that is supported. Multiple reasons, if you care I can list them.
03:21:02 <Thatcher[m]> Btw, I hate to be that guy, but we should move all the non-Graphene related chat to the off topic room
03:21:19 <uhsa> Thatcher[m] wich would you recommend for more security downloading it in aurora or f-droid
03:21:50 <uhsa> yes offcourse that is my last question
03:22:05 <uhsa> i have pixel 4a
03:22:35 <Thatcher[m]> uhsa it doesnt really matter. Just dont get any sketchy apps
03:23:42 <Thatcher[m]> * uhsa it doesnt really matter. Just dont get any sketchy apps (by unknown developers)
03:24:19 <chi00[m]> lol nor is a honeypot
03:24:21 <chi00[m]> nord
03:24:35 <chi00[m]> maybe not but its skethy
03:24:56 <chi00[m]> TheJollyRoger: I have an idea: default  profiles
03:25:05 <verolom[m]> what about protonVPN chi00
03:25:12 <chi00[m]> idk dude
03:25:28 <chi00[m]> less sketchy than nord imo
03:25:49 <uhsa> chi00[m] what would be the best way to use a vpn i use nord because i can pay with a google pay debit card for it bought in a physical store
03:26:10 <somenerd[m]> offtopic
03:26:16 <chi00[m]> that's a good choice then
03:26:17 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:26:19 <chi00[m]> i guess
03:26:40 <uhsa> thanks for the advice!
03:27:13 <chi00[m]> uhsa: checkout some of the privacy/security rooms
03:27:48 <chi00[m]> Can we disable the "End Session" button on the lockscreen of non-owner profiles
03:36:56 <uhsa> is there someway i can disable the screen when i startup saying my device is loading another operating system?
03:37:22 <zzxx123_> No
03:37:29 <somenerd[m]> I don't think so, that screen's there to protect you from a malicious OS
03:37:39 <somenerd[m]> since most people are on stock
03:38:08 <uhsa> thanks and does graphene os send out any identifiers letting it known i am using graphene os?
03:38:16 <somenerd[m]> (of course, GrapheneOS isn't malicious, but the device can't tell if it is malicious or not unless it had the keys fused in)
03:38:47 <louipc> it queries a grapheneos time server, and checks for grapheneos updates
03:39:05 <uhsa> somenerd[m] wich i read is on the roadmap a custom soc hopefully
03:39:09 <louipc> so that could be correlated
03:39:19 <somenerd[m]> other than that, it's similar to AOSP afaict
03:40:24 <uhsa> louipc and do those things also show when i use a vpn?
03:41:08 <louipc> should go thru the vpn
03:42:31 <uhsa> thanks for all the info everyone!

04:09:33 <verolom[m]> gochoingles was a figure of speech... read my reply :)
04:11:19 <D4v1d> I would like to suggest adding the rule "ASCII characters only" to this channel. Because terminal based clients won't display Unicode emojis, nor weird Zalgo (e.g. empty letter font) charcters. Thank you.
04:11:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> D4v1d: I literally said "WHAT".
04:13:27 <D4v1d> gochoingles: I am really sorry, I actually see it on Telegram but not in irssi. (Because terminal is ASCII only)
04:13:47 <louipc> D4v1d: unicode including emoji works fine with irc
04:14:01 <louipc> even with irssi.
04:14:23 <louipc> depends on your fonts and terminal

04:17:11 <D4v1d> Sorry about that. I am going to flash GrapheneOS. But unfortunately all my friends use Snapchat and no one wants to switch to Element. Welp.
04:17:20 <France162849> strcat, I reccomend you only buy elextronics in person
04:19:24 <D4v1d> So many apps are GMS and GSF dependent. That's so unfortunate that there is no FOSS alternative for such apps.
04:19:54 <chi00[m]> I doubt your threat model is NSA bugging you lol
04:20:01 <chi00[m]> accept it as a part of life
04:20:17 <France162849> i dont have to accept the nsa
04:20:30 <France162849> i only buy electronics in person, in unplanned trips
04:20:47 <France162849> to avoid selective hardware cimpromise
04:21:06 <France162849> i also use a vpn router at home, set to 5 node multihop

04:24:13 <chi00[m]> <France162849 "to avoid selective hardware cimp"> unless you're a target they aren't going to bother. Most likely everything is compromised as much as possible to begin with. They won't spend the time to target someone unless they were a high interest target...
04:24:30 <France162849> yeah i know
04:49:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> D4v1d: Try to get them to use Telegram. They will love it. Or Signal. Apparently people are switching to it because of the recent WhatsApp ToS change. Funny move, Facebook.

05:19:09 <jalfredprufrock> Hey guys! Is Moto G4 Plus supported by Graphene OS? Thank you
05:19:31 <mrbeanz[m]> Nope, check the website
05:19:33 <KONCRETE[m]> No
05:20:45 <jalfredprufrock> Oh! Thanks a lot! Is there any such Linux-based OS for my Moto G4?

05:21:33 <dannyknoll3Danny> The Moto g4 Plus doesn't support Graphene, lol — grab a cheap Pixel on eBay or Swappa, worth it just for the easy web installer
05:21:39 <dannyknoll3Danny> jalfredprufrock
05:22:38 <jalfredprufrock> haha! any similar alternatives, like Linux OSs for mobiles?
05:38:38 <j-james[m]> Yeah, take a look at LineageOS and PostmarketOS
05:40:08 <jalfredprufrock> Thanks. Lineage OS doesn't support my device (Moto G4 Plus- Athene) and Postmarket OS somehow failed to install showing me Error: 1!
05:40:30 <akc3n[m]> jalfredprufrock:  this is the #grapheneos official channel. Please take offtopic conversations to #grapheneos-offtopic and also please read https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
05:40:46 <j-james[m]> LineageOS is like a debloated version of Android, basically, while PostmarketOS is much closer to a desktop Linux distribution
05:41:08 <j-james[m]> Ah, yeah, I'd seek support in their respective forums or IRC channels
06:04:16 <kavin> <jalfredprufrock "Thanks. Lineage OS doesn't suppo"> You can try Arrow OS with Android 10: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-beta-arm64-arrowos-10-unofficial.4077253/
06:10:23 <strcat[m]> please don't use this channel for offtopic stuff
06:11:21 <strcat[m]> kavin: j-james: please don't use this channel to promote other completely unrelated projects in the future, thanks
06:11:51 <kavin> sorry, my bad
06:11:56 <strcat[m]> for one thing it misleads people by not explaining how those are not at all the same kind of thing as GrapheneOS and it's also offtopic
06:15:38 <battlepad[m]> Hey guys, using shelter for my work profile shouldnt cause any problems with grapheneOS right?
06:19:39 <pizzaeater69[m]> Using diferent profiles is better
06:23:15 <battlepad[m]> The native grapheneOS profile feature?
06:25:46 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yeah (that's on AOSP too)
06:28:26 <battlepad[m]> Ok, ill give that a try first
07:28:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Mateusz Matliński> Wow now you support Pixel 5, nice!
07:29:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Mateusz Matliński> Keep up the good work!
07:37:19 <kradav[m]> ive noticed an issue, when using signal with screen lock. when i keep signal in the foreground, as i lock the phone, upon the next unlock, it first presents signal screen lock to be unlocked and only after that im able to unlock the phone from lockscreen. this only happens with signal, so im not sure if this is a signal bug or gos bug? or is this perhaps an intended behavior and not a bug?
07:38:49 <strcat[m]> kradav: you aren't being clear enough in your writing
07:38:52 <strcat[m]> explain what's happening more clearly
07:41:11 <strcat[m]> > as i lock the phone
07:41:15 <strcat[m]> How are you locking the phone?
07:41:29 <strcat[m]> turning off the screen is only locking the phone if you have it configured that way
07:41:49 <strcat[m]> > it first presents signal screen lock to be unlocked and only after that im able to unlock the phone from lockscreen
07:41:59 <strcat[m]> that sounds very strange, is not something I've ever heard of before, and just doesn't make sense
07:42:33 <kradav[m]> im sorry. i am using signal with screen lock enabled, set to 10 minutes inactivity timeout, in signal. when i open signal and then lock the phone, either with power button or with set timeout in settings, after the 10 minutes of inactivity pass, when i attempt to unlock my phone, im first presented with signal screen lock unlock prompt and only after unlocking signal, im able to get to lockscreen and unlock the phone.
07:42:52 <strcat[m]> that doesn't make sense
07:42:55 <kradav[m]> yes, i find it strange too
07:43:09 <kradav[m]> would a video demonstration help?
07:43:13 <strcat[m]> please remove any accessibility services or device managers
07:43:14 <strcat[m]> first
07:43:33 <strcat[m]> if you have any kind of device manager, remove that
07:43:53 <strcat[m]> or at least, check to see if you have one that has access to changing lockscreen stuff
07:45:12 <strcat[m]> kradav: and again, pressing power button only locks the phone by default if you have it configured that way
07:45:32 <strcat[m]> kradav: similarly, the screen turning off does not mean the phone is locked, there is a configuration option for how quickly it locks after the screen turns off
07:45:45 <strcat[m]> kradav: you're misinterpreting those 2 things as being equivalent to locking, they aren't
07:46:28 <strcat[m]> there is a configuration menu in Settings for determining how locking works
07:46:50 <strcat[m]> by default, there's a 5 second timeout after the screen turns off before it locks, and power button is set to override that and instantly turn it off
07:47:35 <strcat[m]> also this configuration only works as you would expect via Owner account, it isn't quite fully implemented for secondary users (i.e. they should probably just have the same config as owner instead of trying to make it different)
07:48:06 <strcat[m]>  * also this configuration only works as you would expect via Owner account, it isn't quite fully implemented for secondary users (i.e. they should probably just have the same config as owner instead of trying to make it different, as it will be using the Owner settings in most cases, since Owner controls most of the lockscreen behavior)
07:48:19 <kradav[m]> yes, i have set it in settings for power button to lock instantly. lock after screen timeout is set to immediately
07:48:34 <strcat[m]> kradav: are you sure? are you in a secondary profile or the owner one?
07:49:24 <strcat[m]> kradav: and please make sure you have no accessibility services or device managers
07:49:29 <strcat[m]> and respond back about that
07:50:03 <kradav[m]> i dont have secondary profile set up. i had some accessibility service and device managers turned on, i have disabled them now and going to test if anything changes
07:52:44 <strcat[m]> accessibility services and device managers are very dangerous
07:53:53 <strcat[m]> you really shouldn't use accessibility services unless you have a disability requiring one, it's not an appropriate way to implement something like a password manager rather than using the autofill service (ideally) or at least a custom keyboard (for apps not supporting autofill services)
07:54:10 <strcat[m]> and device managers are meant for devices managed as part of an enterprise device deployment
07:54:22 <strcat[m]> when you enable a device manager, it lists out what it's capable of doing with those powers
07:54:41 <strcat[m]> and, as you can probably see from the list you agreed to, you presumably gave it control over the lockscreen which can break the security of the device
07:55:10 <strcat[m]> we strongly recommend against non-system accessibility services (except where absolutely needed) or device managers, in general
07:56:08 <strcat[m]> nothing we can do about the lockscreen being broken by a device manager that you granted the ability to modify/control the lockscreen (when enabling a device manager, it lists what device manager permissions it is requesting from you, and if it's only supposed to give you remote wipe, then the only thing that should be listed is remote wipe, NOTHING to do with lockscreen)
08:03:29 <kradav[m]> looks like you were right, after disabling accessibility services and device managers, i cant replicate it anymore and works correctly now. sorry, my bad. thank for help!
08:11:28 <poizn[m]> You can't skip using an accessibility service on the pixel 3a. The fact that it doesn't have a led means that very likely we'll miss notifications if we're not close to the phone at the point they're received.
08:12:09 <poizn[m]> Most of the apps that can help with this inconvenience require accessibility access
08:13:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not really, it's a convenience/transparency thing at the cost of security and privacy liability of an app being granted of accessibility services
08:16:19 <strcat[m]> poizn: don't know why you would need an accessibility service for that
08:16:26 <strcat[m]> poizn: and again, it's dangerous and a really bad idea
08:16:44 <somenerd[m]> that's a lot of privilege (accessibility)
08:17:01 <strcat[m]> the always on display feature works just fine
08:17:07 <strcat[m]> and notifications are shown on lockscreen
08:17:50 <strcat[m]> poizn: just be aware if you're using an accessibility service then that app pretty much has as much access as you do, and is as trusted as you are, other than it not being able to use adb
08:18:03 <strcat[m]> but it has as much access as you do to seeing all content all the screen, doing any input, etc.
08:18:13 <strcat[m]> it's a huge single point of failure that you've enabled
08:18:48 <strcat[m]> you're placing an enormous amount of trust in that app and there's a reason it's only for accessibility and other uses of it aren't allowed on the Play Store (and should not be allowed on any other app store with any kind of care for privacy/security either)
08:19:18 <strcat[m]> poizn: and, as you can see above, those things can break the security of the device such as breaking locking the device
08:19:52 <strcat[m]> and I doubt what was happening above was malicious but rather a great example of how by trusting these apps, you aren't simply trusting them to not be malicious but to be highly competent and not have any vulnerabilities
08:20:35 <mk3pi4> Hi everyone, I recently installed GrapheneOS, the install was easy (thanks Sir Micay). This OS is probably overkill for me since I'm just a random who mostly text & calls but whatever.
08:20:35 <mk3pi4> I get the calls instantly when someone calls me, but for the SMS I need to be on the phone, if the phone is idle I don't get notifications and receive the SMS only when I take my phone and go to the home screen. Is it due to my provider or the software ? (Pixel 4A)
08:21:04 <strcat[m]> don't use non-system accessibility services unless you must (our next release includes talkback, and we could include the braille one too) and don't use device managers with permissions beyond wiping, at least (and remember that if they manage a work profile, they own/control that, not you)
08:21:25 <strcat[m]> poizn: we may drop support for non-system accessibility services after bundling some more important ones
08:21:36 <strcat[m]> that's actually fairly likely
08:21:57 <strcat[m]> and if we make a device manager that's flexible enough we'd probably drop support for non-system ones too
08:22:20 <strcat[m]> and I also expect to drop support for configuring network adb in production builds
08:22:43 <strcat[m]> and just have physical access adb (required to enable network adb anyway) in production builds
08:23:45 <strcat[m]> so, doesn't really matter if people disagree with our recommendation, fully intend to make a security improvement (preventing attacker persistence via accessibility services, device managers or network adb) for verified boot (and then checking those fields in Auditor / attestation.app manually isn't needed)
08:39:01 <poizn[m]> By the way. Does the inline autofill feature work? Both my keyboard and pw manager support this feature, as I've seen from a few different screenshots, but for me it doesn't work. I don't get the account on the suggestion strip. Tried with vanadium, bromite, regular chrome and few Firefox. Does it require Google services to function properly?
08:39:43 <poizn[m]> A few Firefox based browsers*
08:41:53 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The keyboard has to support it
08:42:24 <somenerd[m]> I think that Vanadium doesn't support it
08:42:29 <poizn[m]> Using Gboard
08:43:02 <somenerd[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/11/patches/0035-disable-browser-autologin-by-default.patch
08:43:10 <somenerd[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/11/patches/0041-disable-autofill-assistant-by-default.patch
08:43:36 <strcat> somenerd[m]: not related to system autofill
08:44:01 <strcat> poizn[m]: no, OS autofill does not require Google services
08:44:03 <somenerd[m]> yeah, it's only in Vanadium afaik
08:44:20 <strcat> somenerd[m]: Vanadium does not disable system autofill support
08:44:29 <strcat> those patches are not related to system autofill
08:44:39 <somenerd[m]> oh ok
08:44:56 <strcat> I don't think system autofill is supported in Chromium-based browsers in general, and a lot of other apps don't support it either
08:45:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The autofill provided by Android is removed upstream
08:45:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> several versions ago
08:45:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (On Chromium)
08:59:07 <battlepad[m]> <kradav[m] "ive noticed an issue, when using"> Ah, so it wasn't just me. I had this issue on my googled device too since the recent signal update, read the later messages and disabling accessibility helped, thanks\
09:15:24 <strcat> battlepad[m]: which accessibility service was at fault? it's a pretty serious issue
09:15:41 <strcat> battlepad[m]: you should report the issue to the accessibility service / device manager that's at fault
09:15:58 <poizn[m]> I cannot locate the always on display on the pixel 3a. Is it something that's enabled by default/just works? I've been on graphene since Android 10 and I have always been using this accessibility service app to replace the led.
09:18:34 <btcboss2021> Hello
09:19:46 <btcboss2021> When I install graphene os in my google pixel appears always a warning message that is inializating with another OS and a link, any idea how to delete that message?
09:20:07 <catfish[m]> poizn: search in settings for always show time and info
09:20:35 <strcat> btcboss2021: that's supposed to be there when running a different OS than the stock OS on any smartphone with verified boot
09:20:50 <strcat> btcboss2021: GrapheneOS isn't the stock OS, so that is meant to be there at boot
09:21:03 <strcat> btcboss2021: you can skip the screen by double tapping power if you don't want to wait, but it doesn't wait that long anyway
09:21:29 <strcat> (nice when doing development which involves doing a lot of reboots for testing though)
09:21:39 <battlepad[m]> <btcboss2021 "When I install graphene os in my"> is normal, dont worry. always appears
09:22:00 <battlepad[m]> <strcat "battlepad: you should report the"> noted
09:22:12 <btcboss2021> strcat thanks for your answer  is not about waiting could be nice to avoid that message I guess not possible?
09:22:37 <somenerd[m]> no, it's meant to be a sort of warning
09:22:46 <somenerd[m]> (that you're not running stock)
09:22:56 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: it's supposed to be there when you're not running the stock OS
09:22:58 <somenerd[m]>  * don't think so, it's meant to be a sort of warning
09:23:05 <btcboss2021> ok thanks a lot
09:23:08 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: on a device built to run GrapheneOS, you would see that message when running a different OS than GrapheneOS
09:23:14 <strcat[m]> or your own builds of it
09:23:22 <strcat[m]> it's meant to be displayed as part of the verified boot implementation
09:23:39 <strcat[m]> red screen which blocks booting -> verifying the OS failed
09:23:54 <strcat[m]> orange screen with warning that OS is not being verified -> device is unlocked / verified boot is disabled
09:24:28 <strcat[m]> yellow screen with notice (not warning) that another OS is being successfully verified / booted -> device is locked with an alternate OS being verified with key flashed to secure element
09:24:39 <strcat[m]> no screen -> stock OS being successfully verified / booted
09:25:00 <strcat[m]>  * orange screen with warning that OS is not being verified -> device is unlocked so verified boot is disabled
09:25:28 <strcat[m]> we would still have this on our own hardware, it's just that the stock OS would be ours
09:25:39 <btcboss2021> thanks for the info if anytime you find a solution to avoid OS verification by the boot tell me please
09:25:41 <Lestat[m]> God how fucking massive is GOS source code
09:26:01 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: you really don't want to avoid it.... it's a very important security feature fully supported by GrapheneOS
09:26:05 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: I think you're confused
09:26:19 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: the message you're seeing means you're booting an alternate OS that is being *successfully* verified
09:26:23 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: it is a *good thing*
09:26:36 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that you'd want to block a message that says that the OS has been verified
09:26:42 <strcat[m]> there is no way to disable firmware verified boot and the firmware handing things off to the OS
09:26:52 <btcboss2021> Is a good thing about security but not in commercial way for customers like we have
09:26:58 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: please read what I wrote above again
09:27:11 <somenerd[m]> read what strcat said
09:27:26 <somenerd[m]> it's a good thing, even for consumers
09:27:26 <btcboss2021> ok read
09:27:30 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: GrapheneOS isn't the stock OS so therefore GrapheneOS is verified via a key flashed to the secure element, not the hard-wired stock OS key
09:27:36 <btcboss2021> noted
09:27:39 <btcboss2021> thanks a lot
09:27:45 <somenerd[m]> for example, let's say that someone flashed a malicious OS and you used stock
09:27:52 <somenerd[m]> the warning would catch it
09:27:56 <strcat[m]> btcboss2021: on a device where GrapheneOS was the stock OS, the OS key hard-wired in the firmware would be our verified boot key for that device
09:28:15 <Lestat[m]> 96% of the source code downloaded
09:28:19 <strcat[m]> therefore, on a device built to run GrapheneOS, it would be verified using the hard-wired OEM OS key, not a key flashed to secure element
09:28:25 <strcat[m]> Lestat: it's more than just the OS source code
09:28:46 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "Lestat: it's more than just the "> Ik but its still massive
09:28:46 <strcat[m]> Lestat: it's the entire history of all repositories used for the OS, SDK, and various other development tools, etc. including emulator
09:28:55 <strcat[m]> Lestat: it's the whole history of the sources
09:29:05 <strcat[m]> Lestat: of all included AOSP / GrapheneOS repositories
09:29:29 <Lestat[m]> Oh jesus
09:29:36 <Lestat[m]> Well that just ate 20% of my ssd
09:29:41 <strcat[m]> it's possible to do a lightweight sync
09:29:42 <strcat[m]> which syncs less
09:29:46 <strcat[m]> but Git is not particularly good at that
09:30:00 <strcat[m]> so it still downloads a lot more than strictly required for just a snapshot of the current sources
09:30:15 <strcat[m]> Git is meant for downloading your own copy of the ENTIRE source code repository
09:30:19 <strcat[m]> and that's what it does by default
09:30:21 <strcat[m]> for each repository
09:30:54 <strcat[m]> Lestat: so for example each Linux kernel repo has ~1.2GB of sources
09:31:06 <Lestat[m]> God damn
09:31:20 <Lestat[m]> Also daniel what was the missing permission for the notification dots
09:31:39 <strcat[m]> Lestat: there's a special access permission for notification dots
09:31:57 <Lestat[m]> Ah
09:31:58 <strcat[m]> Lestat: there's resource configuration with a list of default apps to include
09:32:06 <strcat[m]> we added our launcher to that similarly to how stock OS adds stock OS launcher
09:32:23 <strcat[m]> it's just one of many little minor resource configuration things not set up for you by AOSP
09:32:27 <strcat[m]> there's a lot more like that we need to set up
09:32:31 <strcat[m]> we deal with a lot already
09:33:02 <strcat[m]> Lestat: anyway what I was saying above was each kernel repository has ~1.2GB of current uncompressed sources for the current source tree, but then also has ~1.5GB or so of *highly compressed* deltas for the *entire history* from the beginning
09:33:06 <Lestat[m]> Well shit hope i can find some sort of reference lmfao
09:33:23 <Lestat[m]> Ive never touched the aosp source code
09:33:34 <strcat[m]> Lestat: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/308a02bc540080078afbc8a5b96d2e7ac0f43272
09:33:41 <strcat[m]> if you're asking about the notification thing in particular
09:33:54 <strcat[m]> normally a vendor would set this via an overlay rather than modifying frameworks/base directly
09:34:25 <strcat[m]> but we see ourselves as making a new base OS rather than simply a specific downstream configuration of AOSP so we modify the defaults directly rather than using overlays
09:34:51 <strcat[m]> for us, it just makes more sense to modify the defaults directly
09:35:02 <Lestat[m]> I was told i should edit the default perms yes?
09:35:13 <strcat[m]> Lestat: it's not a normal runtime permission
09:35:23 <strcat[m]> so it's not set via /etc/default-permissions
09:35:33 <strcat[m]> Lestat: you can see how defaults are set for it above, in that commit
09:35:43 <Lestat[m]> oh
09:35:50 <strcat[m]> it's a special access permission not a normal runtime permission toggle
09:35:59 <somenerd[m]> it's in config
09:36:11 <Lestat[m]> So what am i supposed to do lol
09:36:13 <strcat[m]> it's default with now for fresh GrapheneOS installs (and I guess fresh profiles)
09:36:18 <strcat[m]> Lestat: unsure what you mean
09:36:22 <strcat[m]> the notification thing is dealt with now
09:36:27 <Lestat[m]> Danny has been bribing me to contribute
09:36:34 <strcat[m]> we just haven't done a new release, and it won't change the preference for existing users
09:36:54 <strcat[m]> issue is resolved for all new users (including new user profiles presumably)
09:36:56 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "the notification thing is dealt "> im late to the party :(
09:37:02 <strcat[m]> there is a lot more to do
09:37:05 <strcat[m]> that is resolved though
09:37:36 <Lestat[m]> Ok gimme something to work on lol
09:37:47 <mk3pi4> Quick question : on GrapheneOS, if I'm only calling and receiving few SMS and I'm not browsing the internet neither installing any apps, security updates are not important, right ?
09:38:09 <somenerd[m]> it's still important
09:38:18 <somenerd[m]> ex:memory corruption bugs
09:38:39 <mk3pi4> i understand thank you
09:38:55 <strcat> security updates are always important
09:39:01 <strcat> if you don't care about security, why use GrapheneOS
09:39:48 <mk3pi4> if you don't care about security, why use GrapheneOS -> I just support things that I like
09:40:28 <mk3pi4> it's overkill for my use i know
09:40:57 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not really, it's pretty much baseline for secure and private OS
09:42:08 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> 0-day exploits turning to n-day being able to used for outdated OS (which means instead of paying to use those, it is disseminated and can be used for free) is a security hole
09:42:30 <somenerd[m]> it's focused on making structural changes to fix weaknesses in AOSP afaict
09:42:44 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Not really, it's pretty much bas"> (For that reason most OEM Android are insecure)
09:44:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Most companies can't even provide a regular security update, lowering the gate to compromise the OS by remote code execution or privilege escalation
09:44:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (Talking about Android stock OS by the likes of Huawei, Xiaomi, etc)
09:45:15 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <somenerd[m] "it's focused on making structura"> Some examples include the hardened_malloc, bionic, and the exec spawning model
09:45:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Oh, they left
09:45:45 <somenerd[m]> and the permissions added as well
09:46:53 <somenerd[m]> (network, sensors)
10:00:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​xoec> Can I reflash graphene OS on Graphene OS?
10:22:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> Why not just use internal reset feature?
10:28:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​xoec> I may have flashed with mistake the first time and currently having an issue that I can't delete any app....
10:34:41 <strcat[m]> not clear what you mean
10:35:31 <strcat[m]> sounds like you may be confused about something and are making the assumption that it has to do with not installing properly
10:36:11 <strcat[m]> if you get the proper screen on boot showing that a different OS is being loaded, rather than a warning saying that the device isn't being verified, then you have a proper installation
10:36:29 <strcat[m]> and you have strong assurances that it is bit-for-bit identical to everyone else's GrapheneOS installation on that device model
10:36:52 <strcat[m]> a corrupt/incomplete OS install wouldn't boot
10:37:07 <strcat[m]> the device being locked assures that only a fully intact and authenticated OS will boot
10:42:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​xoec> Can you please advise what may be an issue then?
10:43:37 <sphinx[m]> @Jxoec we can't see the videos that you sent

11:34:53 <jdodjrj[m]> Currently I am facing this issue with multiple apps (osmand maps for ex)
11:35:06 <strcat[m]> well sounds like something is seriously screwed up
11:35:13 <strcat[m]> did you have a device manager or just an accessibility service?
11:35:33 <jdodjrj[m]> <strcat[m] "did you have a device manager or"> No
11:36:13 <strcat[m]> and have you disabled any core OS components or done anything weird with adb?
11:36:19 <strcat[m]> seems like something along those lines
11:37:04 <jdodjrj[m]> No, not at all. I use graphene for few months and everything worked fine. I do very few things on my phone and use very few apps

11:43:51 <strcat[m]> one way is via the bug report capture tool within the OS

11:44:13 <strcat[m]> doesn't intend to contain private info but does contain a fair bit of it in practice

11:59:31 <strcat[m]> all that is enabled as expected, right?
11:59:37 <strcat[m]> all the system apps should be allowed to do it by default
12:00:04 <strcat[m]> maybe at some point you disabled it?
12:00:48 <strcat[m]> specifically make sure Package installer and Permission controller have it but all those other base system apps should have it by default
12:00:58 <strcat[m]> tbh I don't really understand why Settings even allows you to revoke stuff like this from core system
12:02:08 <strcat[m]> jdodjrj: appears that Package installer, Permission controller and/or Storage Manager (all base system components, along with all the rest additionally listed there when enabling showing system apps) have usage stats access disabled (it's enabled by default)
12:02:17 <strcat[m]> so it gets a security error trying to access stuff it needs to uninstall

12:09:37 <sphinx[m]> maybe this is unrelated but there are 3 issues reported about uninstalling that 'Vigilante' app: https://github.com/FunkyMuse/Vigilante/search?q=uninstall&type=issues
12:14:30 <strcat> sphinx[m]: issue resolved
12:14:42 <strcat> issue was that they disabled special access permissions used by base OS components
12:14:56 <strcat> jdodjrj[m]: I'd also go through the other special access perms and make sure you didn't disable anything important, etc.
12:16:32 <strcat> jdodjrj[m]: rest is probably not as important
14:05:16 <rosie48> Someone stole my nick.  Or else the system isn't recognizing me.  Oh, well.
14:07:37 <rosie48> Can microG be used with GraphenOS?  Hubby has a few apps that he would still like to run from his phone after the switch to GOS.
14:10:58 <strcat[m]> no, it can't
14:11:52 <strcat[m]> rosie48: are you sure those apps have a hard dependency on Google services? have you checked? and if they do, many apps won't work with microG anyway (especially reliably, over time, even if they work today chances are they'll break in the future at some point)
14:14:55 <rosie48> I'm not sure yet.  I'm still sorting out which ones he really wants/needs, and then I can evaluate.  He does a lot of travel for work and has some apps related to that (airlines, hotels, etc.)
14:16:11 <hidden> Is it possbile to install GrapheneOS on Oppo Reno2?
14:18:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
14:18:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please see the supported devices section on grapheneos.org
14:18:45 <rosie48> @hidden  It's pretty much just Pixels.
14:19:35 <hidden> Is there any alternatives to GrapheneOS that support oppo?
14:21:48 <rosie48> I've never even heard of Oppo.
14:22:28 <hidden> Its owned by Huawei

14:25:47 <rosie48> Basically, the Pixel is the only phone whose manufacturer isn't openly hostile to alternative OSes.
14:26:42 <strcat> rosie48: some other vendors like Sony are okay but they don't make particularly secure devices + skip making hardware security features compatible with alternate OSes
14:27:10 <rosie48> Ah, good to know.  I don't trust Sony any farther than I can throw them, though.
14:28:11 <rosie48> I found one of hubby

14:29:52 <rosie48> If push comes to shove, he can access the airline/hotel Web sites through the browser instead of through the app (which is always how I have done it anyway).  I just don't want him regretting the switch to GrapheneOS.

15:03:40 <rosie48> walter80[m] Thanks!  At any rate, I have the answer to my question now.
15:03:44 <strcat> walter80[m]: AOSP doesn't have Google Play services, CalyxOS has an alternate implementation of a subset of it
15:03:54 <strcat> walter80[m]: you're posting inaccurate info
15:04:37 <strcat> I'm not sure how taking AOSP and *adding* Google services to it makes something 'degoogled', doesn't make much sense to say that
15:05:03 <strcat> AOSP doesn't have proprietary Google apps and services, CalyxOS does have proprietary Google apps and services bundled
15:05:13 <strcat> not only via microG
15:05:27 <walter80[m]> Well I am waiting on GOS to make its own implementation to support dependent apps, like the website says :)
15:05:31 <strcat> AOSP only uses Google as the provider of certain open standard services (as does CalyxOS)
15:05:42 <strcat> walter80[m]: we are not making an implementation of Google services
15:06:18 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS is planning on making a stub implementation, which pretends that the Google servers are offline
15:07:03 <walter80[m]> Grapheneos website says you are looking into an alternative to microg, is that not correct?
15:07:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> somenerd: when will they be online /s
15:07:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> We should get hosting for our implementation from nouptime.com
15:07:23 <strcat[m]> walter80: that's not really what the website says
15:07:57 <strcat[m]> it says that we won't be including Google services in GrapheneOS
15:08:01 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not against Google services, they just don't belong integrated into the OS

15:56:12 <rosie48> Is there some way I could download the apps (contacts, camera, etc.) that come with GrapheneOS so that I can check them out while I do the prep work (buying the phone, installing Arch Linux on my computer, etc.) to get ready for the install?  I mainly want to see what they're like and get used to them before the switch.

16:01:36 <rosie48> I need a supported OS on my computer to be able to install GrapheneOS on my phone (I'm currently running Win7, which isn't supported).  I've already decided to go back to Linux, anyway, and Arch Linux is what the GOS devs use, so I figure that's my best bet.
16:02:43 <rosie48> I'm sure the included apps are easy to learn and use, but I still want to see what they're like and see what differences there are to my current ones (especially the camera).
16:05:34 <strcat[m]> rosie48: the included apps are really barebones, you'd presumably install Aurora Store, F-Droid and other apps
16:05:48 <strcat[m]> rosie48: we don't bundle 3rd party apps in general, better to have people install them
16:06:02 <strcat[m]> we do intend to make a 1st party app install/update system with a 1st party repository

16:15:02 <rosie48> Ok, good to know.  I'm aware of the not bundling thing, which is why I initially thought GOS came with NO apps AT ALL.  I guess I'll have to "go shopping" in the F-Droid and Aurora stores.
16:20:22 <dannyknoll3Danny> rosie48: don't shop too hard. More apps, more attack surface!
16:25:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> strcat[m]: So I should not install F-Droid then.
16:25:41 <M647509735485097> Found that I sometimes won't receive a text until I unlock my phone and will be time stamped from 5-10 mins ago.. Any ideas?
16:25:44 <rosie48> Of course!  My phone is a phone, not a do-all, be-all portable computer.  It will have only the apps that I need when I'm away from home.  One of the things I'm particularly interested in is whether the camera app will save in .RAW format.  After using it on my current phone, it's a must for me (yeah, I know about the file sizes and I'm ok with
16:25:45 <rosie48> that).
16:27:22 <M647509735485097> <rosie48 "Of course!  My phone is a phone,"> Stock camera does not have the ability. Unsure about Open Camera
16:27:34 <rosie48> Hmmm. . .
16:28:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> rosie48: Then why are they called SMARTphones?
16:28:46 <rosie48> To induce normies to use them as a do-all, be-all portable computer.
16:31:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Then you are looking for a old-school Nokia phone. Smaller attack surface that can be pulled out by the carrier, amirite? GrapheneOS hardens a smartphone, making a do-all be-all portable computer safe. A powerful small device, though a desktop computer can be way much more powerful than that.

17:49:37 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, darn, he just left.
17:52:53 <rosie48> TheJollyRoger  No worries--I found your post helpful.

18:22:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Is it safe to use F-Droid in GrapheneOS?
18:26:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​emtekl> I personally don't use Graphene yet. But generally, from what I know, it's safer than using playstore'apps from what I know (therefore from Aurora Store which uses an anonymous profile to get apps from play store).Always prioritize apps from F-Droid.Correct me if I'm wrong people
18:28:11 <jdodjrj[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<gochoingles> Is it safe to use "> Better use aurora store
18:28:21 <jdodjrj[m]> On any os
18:29:08 <strcat[m]> https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/03/in-wild-series-october-2020-0-day.html
18:29:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> It's safe to use F-Droid.But remember F-Droid is very slow in providing updates and lack a lot of security thenF-Droid also use very outdated api and doesn't care fixing that.So using AuroraStore and Google store apps are safer
18:29:57 <princemachiavell> Even better just use the browser to access mobile sites.
18:47:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I thought so too, but Daniel's comment freaks me out a bit.
18:47:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> <strcat[m]> rosie48: we don't bundle 3rd party apps in general, better to have people install them
18:47:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> <strcat[m]> we do intend to make a 1st party app install/update system with a 1st party repository
18:47:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> <strcat[m]> and include 1st party builds of 3rd party apps in there
18:48:00 <strcat[m]> what about that freaks you out?
18:48:02 <strcat[m]> ???
18:48:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I almost thought that F-Droid was not safe.
18:49:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> But I think it must be because when we get them, they are up to datw.
18:49:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> *date
18:49:55 <strcat[m]> not really sure what you're talking about
18:50:10 <strcat[m]> or what it has to do with those messages I sent (not the full context for them either)
18:53:05 <rosie48> Daniel, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but near as I can tell, F-Droid isn't very good about keeping their own app or their repository up to date.
18:55:26 <rosie48> Daniel's comments to me were in relation to my question about the stock apps that come with GrapheneOS, and future plans for a GrapheneOS specific repository.
19:09:00 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> probably will add fdroid to GOS repo
19:09:29 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> to avoid confusion version mismatch issue with multiple profiles
19:09:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​emtekl> Not to ne freaked out. Both use signing keys to check apps authenticité.Anyway, if it can help, I use LibreAV to check if an app is malware
19:10:09 <TheJollyRoger> rosie48: Yes, that's correct, F-Droid often lag significantly behind upstream.
19:11:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> > authenticitéOh, your main language is another one? Mine is Latin Spanish.
19:12:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: So that is why people normally use external repos when available.
19:12:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​emtekl> *Authenticity*
19:12:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I know.
19:12:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> Not needed. You can check permissions before install and if you want, virustotal can be used
19:12:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​emtekl> Check this app to get more confident in what you downlaod
19:12:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> N​emtekl shared a photo on Telegram with caption: ''
19:13:12 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> just get software from legit source
19:13:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> Using a app for checking other apps is nonsense
19:13:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I once also used LibreAV. Turns out it was not really useful because it did not detect Natrium (G Firebase).
19:16:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​emtekl> True : F-Droid and Aurora are both legit.No nom for over fear 😉
19:16:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Thanks!
19:18:39 <kokoto[m]> Does exist any security issue for ussing Aurora with anonim account rather than with my own google account?
19:19:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> NoSecurity is equal. Privacy is slightly better
19:20:55 <kokoto[m]> Thanks. Then I'll continue using an anonim account then
19:33:28 <Clutchward> I'm new to flashing an android and had wanted to try lineageOS as graphene seemed to be a big dive and eventually move to it. However I can't get lineage to work and Graphene doesn't work either.
19:33:51 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward, are you trying the web installer?
19:34:04 <Clutchward> If anyone could help I have a pixel 4a sitting here I want to get rid of as much of google as possible.
19:34:11 <Clutchward> No. CLI
19:34:23 <Clutchward> Web installer has a few buttons that are not clickable.
19:34:30 <Clutchward> I've tried different browsers.
19:34:50 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: You'll need to use either Chrome, Edge, or Chromium. Some have reported it to work in Brave although that's not supported.
19:35:00 <TheJollyRoger> Tor Browser and FireFox don't adequately support WebUSB and they will be grayed out.
19:35:06 <Clutchward> o
19:35:31 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: it's far safer, faster, and easier if you install using that. If you are having difficulty with the commandline install, I don't recommend you try and go forward with it when the web installer exists.
19:35:41 <TheJollyRoger> You will ABSOLUTELY need to read everything carefully before you begin.
19:35:45 <Clutchward> Sure.
19:36:15 <TheJollyRoger> Because there's little details in there that will make *all the difference* on whether you end up with a wonderful, working GrapheneOS installation, or if you end up frustrated with no progress at all.
19:36:33 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, the webpage will tell you "don't do it in incognito mode."
19:36:48 <TheJollyRoger> Some people ignore that and wonder why they get an error message halfway through the installation.
19:39:22 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: Also, one more thing - if you have difficulty with the Commandline install, don't go looking at other places on the internet or third-party "install GrapheneOS" guides. You're likely to end up with a compromised system that has had its system variables messed up, third party crapware installed to it, or a $400 paperweight.
19:40:55 <Clutchward> okay thanks
19:41:00 <TheJollyRoger> The web installer will not allow you to proceed unless it considers it safe to do so, and unless you seriously try to abuse the device, it won't let you brick and you can try again if it fails. (Again, unless you're trying to cause a brick like pulling the cable while it's sending the bootloader)
19:41:07 <Clutchward> I'll read this over and get chrome
19:41:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, good luck!
19:41:24 <TheJollyRoger> If you do have any difficulty, generally, what causes issues,
19:41:25 <Clutchward> Thanks. I'll be back if I come to an issue if that's okay
19:41:34 <TheJollyRoger> Of course it's alright - before you go though, I just have one tip:
19:42:07 <Clutchward> sure
19:43:43 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that your phone MUST be in Fastboot (with a black screen) in order to flash the image or unlock the bootloader. If you find that you can unlock the bootloader, but then flashing hangs and doesn't go forward, if you are using the Google Branded cable, this is usually the result of your computer motherboard's USB firmware support being lacking, or the USB slots on your motherboard being
19:43:45 <TheJollyRoger> incompletely traced. If this happens, it's nothing you did, it's because some vendors are extremely careless and only implement the barest minimum of features that the majority of people will use on USB and don't adequately implement the wiring or firmware support for niche use cases like talking to device bootloader interfaces.
19:44:38 <TheJollyRoger> If that happens, turning the USB plug upside-down, or switching to another USB slot, OR switching to another computer entirely will likely fix the issue. It's not your fault if this happens, it's simply the motherboard vendors being lazy and not adequately implementing everything.
19:44:55 <Clutchward> Fasboot is the one that syays [Locked] in green or [unlocked] in red, right?
19:45:01 <Clutchward> I  have no issues getting to that point.
19:45:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, that's correct!
19:45:19 <TheJollyRoger> Also make sure the ADB server is not running when you try the web installer.
19:45:27 <TheJollyRoger> If it is, you will get an error.
19:45:38 <TheJollyRoger> Or flashing will halt because it's busy.
19:46:03 <TheJollyRoger> (That is, if you have ADB/Fastboot)
19:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> If it is, the easiest way to stop it is to reboot the computer, and if you installed a third-party fastboot (read: anything you didn't download from the official Google android website), then you'll have to remove it first.
19:46:33 <Clutchward> not running okay. So on windows I fore close adb.exe in task mgr?
19:46:47 <TheJollyRoger> Just reboot.
19:47:01 <Clutchward> ok
19:48:58 <Clutchward> wait do I not need usb debugging for this install?
19:49:03 <Clutchward> everything always says I need that on?
19:49:57 <TheJollyRoger> You don't. You just need to switch OEM unlocking on and get fastboot up.
19:50:02 <Clutchward> >You need to boot your phone into the bootloader interface. To do this, you need to hold the volume down button while the phone boots.
19:50:08 <Clutchward> I've always had trouble there.
19:50:24 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: forget everything you have seen off of GrapheneOS.org on installing GrapheneOS.
19:50:24 <Clutchward> I get to the bootloader but the moment I unpress a button it boots up
19:50:37 <TheJollyRoger> You've been given incorrect instructions, so... let me help you out.
19:50:41 <TheJollyRoger> Switch your phone off for me?
19:50:51 <Clutchward> k
19:50:52 <Clutchward> it's off
19:51:29 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. I want you to press and hold down the Volume Down key. Once you hear the click, press and hold down the power key and keep those both held down until the phone gives you a black screen with white text on it and says something about bootloader status.
19:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> As soon as it does, let go of both buttons.
19:52:16 <Clutchward> okay im in
19:52:23 <Clutchward> this is the one with [locked] in green
19:52:29 <Clutchward> back to official guide i guess ty
19:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. The official guide will tell you everything - unofficial guides may or may not get you a $400 paperweight.
19:53:54 <TheJollyRoger> Now... if you've already set "OEM Unlocking" in your debugging options,
19:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> you can plug your phone in and begin the process in the web installer.
19:54:11 <TheJollyRoger> If not, click start and the OS will start.
19:54:22 <TheJollyRoger> *click start in fastboot by selecting it with "Volume Up/Down"
19:54:28 <TheJollyRoger> But this is how to get to the fastboot screen.
19:54:45 <Clutchward> https://i.ibb.co/tMQcWX4/image.png
19:54:48 <Clutchward> that's where I am
19:54:57 <Clutchward> the guide is dling the sunfish image
19:55:01 <Clutchward> and I'm not touching the phone
19:55:09 <Clutchward> the phone is still in fastboot mode: unlocked
19:55:14 <Clutchward> is this correct?
19:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> You're doing great, champ!
19:55:39 <Clutchward> Awesome thank you so much for the help
19:55:56 <TheJollyRoger> Keep the phone on your desk, make sure the cable is snug, don't disturb it once the flashing has begun.
19:56:26 <Clutchward> yeah I used a direct motherboard usb port
19:56:34 <TheJollyRoger> You may see it do some weird things, or go through some weird screens, and show you "fastbootd" with yellow and blue lettering and show you a strange menu. Wait until it returns to "fastboot" before you lock the bootloader.
19:56:39 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
19:56:47 <Clutchward> kk
19:57:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. while it's in "fastbootd" data is being transferred and written to the system partition slot.
19:57:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I would ask a question in OT, but nobody has posted for a good while and I am afraid I end up spamming.
19:57:39 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, yes?
19:58:06 <Clutchward> When this all finishes and I'm in Graphene as opposed to stock, what will factory reset give me? Base Graphene, or back to stock?
19:58:14 <poisonoushydra[m> I posted something 30 minutes ago...
19:58:16 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, I tell you what, ask me in the offtopic channel again, and I'll answer as soon as I'm finished here.
19:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: If you've installed GrapheneOS according to the directions, a factory reset will return you to a fresh install of GrapheneOS.
19:58:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I just got Qubes installed.
19:59:29 <Clutchward> :) okay @TheJollyRoger it's going through the auto flash dance right now. :)
19:59:40 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: great! You're on the home stretch!
19:59:50 <Clutchward> "fastbootd" this is new?
20:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Right now, data is being sent to your phone and it's being written to the system partition slot.
20:00:08 <Clutchward> k
20:00:30 <TheJollyRoger> So even though the phone will respond to you, *don't* disturb it until it finished.
20:00:51 <Clutchward> yeah I've messed with things during install processes before :P only trouble comes
20:00:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, yeah.
20:01:11 <sphinx[m]> @gochoingles seems like bridge is down in off-topic room: https://view.matrix.org/room/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org/
20:01:25 <TheJollyRoger> this can take a few minutes, depending on how fast your USB speed is. Not all computers have it equal, between differences in CPUs, firmware, motherboards, and bus speed.
20:01:42 <Clutchward> usb 3.1
20:01:48 <Clutchward> but yeah ima grab coffee
20:05:51 <Clutchward> Okay it;s back on fasboot [unlocked] and the "Flashed sunfish-factory-2021.03.06.00.zip to device." bar is full
20:06:01 <Clutchward> do I click the lock bootloader buttton now?
20:06:19 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: yes.
20:06:38 <TheJollyRoger> Optionally, you can boot it with the bootloader unlocked just to test, but if it doesn't boot, we just unlock and try again.
20:06:59 <TheJollyRoger> So click "Lock Bootloader".
20:07:10 <Clutchward> k back to fastboot [locked], just [start] now?
20:07:30 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Yes - let me know if you can see a yellow screen that says "Your device is loading a different operating system"
20:07:45 <TheJollyRoger> If you see that, that means the verified boot is on and enforcing, just that the keys are to GrapheneOS' keys, rather than Google's keys.
20:08:16 <Clutchward> ... I hit the power button to [start] it went to a screen with little text telling me aout a different operating system being loaded, then went back to fastboot
20:08:20 <Clutchward> try again?
20:08:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, try again, Unlock, and proceed through the steps one more time.
20:08:50 <Clutchward> ooo exciting
20:08:54 <Clutchward> "grapheneos"
20:08:59 <Clutchward> wow thank you so much!
20:09:02 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, you made it?
20:09:03 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:09:06 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
20:09:11 <TheJollyRoger> Now, there's just one more step that needs to be done...
20:09:15 <Clutchward> all because I used unoficial guides
20:09:16 <Clutchward> heh
20:09:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, yep! :)
20:09:23 <TheJollyRoger> One more step...
20:09:31 <TheJollyRoger> Actually, two, although one is optional but highly recommended.
20:09:38 <TheJollyRoger> The first one, is that we want to turn OEM unlocking back off.
20:09:46 <Clutchward> okay sec
20:10:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. This way, someone will need to actually have the password to your phone, *or* issue a factory reset from recovery mode (which will cause all the data on your phone to be lost) in order to get at that switch a second time.
20:10:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Blow me down. I fucked up. Qubes says in the log "Failed to start kernel modules", and it is frozen at Starting Cryptography Setup.
20:11:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Perhaps I should have stayed with Devuan.
20:11:23 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - ah, shoot, not sure what happened there, but unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to help you on this one, sorry.
20:11:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Cryptography Setup seems to be LUKS.
20:12:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Points to one of my encrypted partitions(?).
20:12:37 <Clutchward> I'm in settings and searching for oem gives me no results?
20:12:39 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: once you've got OEM unlocking switched back off, you'll be asked to reboot your phone. As soon as you can, once OEM unlocking is off, you'll want to disable debugging options and never use them again; they all raise a significant amount of attack surface and they aren't intended for advanced functionality unless you're capturing a bug report.
20:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: Go to "System -> About Phone" scroll all the way to the bottom, and tap on "build number" ten times rapidly.
20:13:18 <TheJollyRoger> This should report "You are now a developer."
20:13:24 <TheJollyRoger> After the tenth try.
20:14:28 <TheJollyRoger> That menu is hidden by default because the options in it will actually reduce security significantly. However, because we wanted to be sure if you attempted a flash and accidentally messed up, you could unlock the bootloader a second time and try again.
20:14:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Rebooting into fastboot and unlocking the bootloader from there should have been easier, no? If I remember correctly thst can be done.
20:14:56 <Clutchward> Okay OEM off
20:14:58 <TheJollyRoger> That's why OEM unlocking is set to be "on" by default.
20:15:02 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: great!
20:15:08 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - sorry, what do you mean?
20:15:44 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: last step, and this one's optional. You can visit attestation.app/tutorial to pair with the in-house attestationserver for self-monitoring of integrity and to verify the authenticity of the keys in the secure element via Android Remote Attestation.
20:15:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: I remember having heard you can unlock OEM by going into fastboot mode on the Pixel and pressing one of the volume buttons.
20:16:23 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't have a second Android phone, you'll use the in-house attestation server, which will allow you to see the audit results on the screen of your computer using your web browser.
20:16:30 <Clutchward> https://i.ibb.co/RykW3xN/Screenshot-20210318-151521.png
20:16:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Or lock it.
20:16:58 <Clutchward> USB debugging is off, what't that top toggle which is on for?
20:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles You do have to unlock and relock from fastboot, but if there's a way to get at that switch from fastboot, I'm not aware of it.
20:17:25 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: Keep USB debugging off, that's a MAJOR attack surface vector!
20:17:37 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: The toggle at the top should turn Debugging options back off.
20:17:57 <Clutchward> okay both off
20:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> So now that you've set OEM unlocking to off, slide debugging options back off and exit from those settings. Debugging options should disappear from the menu when you return to it.
20:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:18:18 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: I'd like to cordially welcome you aboard the good ship GrapheneOS!
20:18:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Clutchward: USB Debugging. Whatever device it connects to allows anyone to fetch and modify anything. This is normally only used by people that have no choice but to stay with stock ROM, such as myself.
20:18:44 <Clutchward> haha thanks! thanks for the help! use this to "warn" other newbies about using official vs nonofficial sources
20:18:58 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: yarr, ye be welcome!
20:19:15 <TheJollyRoger> If you find GrapheneOS useful, or want to support our efforts at doing things like adding more features, more research, or placing "feature bounties" out...
20:19:23 <Clutchward> last question for now, what "store" is recommended for apps? I vaguely remember one being suggested
20:19:28 <Clutchward> I think I  have the apk somewhere
20:19:36 <Clutchward> f-droid?
20:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> Please send the devs something at https://grapheneos.org/donate -- all proceeds go directly to the project, they keep this ship sailing.
20:20:07 <TheJollyRoger> Well, there's a few. F-Droid isn't really recommended but we know a lot of people do like it, so that's one of them. A lot of us use the Aurora Store, which allows you to download from Google Play Store anonymously.
20:20:39 <Clutchward> is there a good apk to get aurora store?
20:21:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you can download it direct from https://auroraoss.com/
20:21:48 <TheJollyRoger> That's probably the best way to do it; GrapheneOS follows the standard Android Certificate Pinning model.
20:22:09 <TheJollyRoger> So you want to source as many apps as you can from their respective authors, or Play Store through Aurora.
20:22:17 <TheJollyRoger> Rather than F-Droid.
20:23:49 <TheJollyRoger> F-Droid does their own third-party builds and signing of upstream's apps, so they not only lag behind upstream, but they also become a trusted third party, meaning you must both trust them as well as trust upstream, rather than simply trusting your upstream app provider.
20:25:19 <Clutchward> I'm going to try aurora store. All I really need is an mp3 player and a video player :)
20:25:33 <rosie> Wow, that's good to know!  I thought they were merely a repository of developer builds.
20:26:26 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: great!
20:26:31 <rosie> (F-Droid, that is.)
20:27:05 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: yeah, it's a small, but important little snag.
20:27:31 <TheJollyRoger> Google Play has a decentralized signing model, where each respective app developer can hold their own keys to their own apps.
20:27:54 <rosie> I thought Google was changing that model.
20:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> They allow developers to opt in to a model where Google will sign keys on their behalf, but they still publish their apps directly.
20:28:24 <rosie> I've heard they were forcing devs to start letting them (Google) hold the keys.
20:29:23 <TheJollyRoger> Don't think that's the case. They encourage it because this means it's harder to lose your keys, but it's optional.
20:31:29 <rosie> Well, not being a dev myself, I haven't followed it too closely, but I had heard some complaints from some devs about the issue.
20:31:49 <TheJollyRoger> It's encouraged, but optional.
20:33:17 <dazinism> Think they still planning to make it compulsory later this year?
20:33:42 <rosie> Well, in any case, @TheJollyRoger , this is the second time I've watched you walk someone through the GOS install, and I'm feeling more and more confident (and excited) about getting my own phones done.  Just have to do all of the prep work first. . .
20:34:00 <TheJollyRoger> dazinism: well, guess we'll see how this goes down.
20:34:16 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: yarr, it's a pretty simple process!
20:34:32 <dazinism> Yeah, a bit surprising not to hear more about it
20:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
20:34:45 <rosie> Bread and circuses. . .
20:34:47 <dazinism> There was some push back against
20:34:53 <TheJollyRoger> Because if they offer no way to keep custody of your own keys, that's a very hostile move.
20:35:28 <nescientone[m]> <rosie "Well, not being a dev myself, I "> I noticed this too. For example, the FairEmail developer wrote: ”I do not hand over the signing keys of my apps to Google. However, in the second half of 2021 I am required to hand over my signing keys to Google." From their github
20:35:58 <rosie> That's along the same lines of what I'd heard from a few other developers.
20:36:31 <TheJollyRoger> Well, GrapheneOS certainly won't be going that route.
20:37:14 <rosie> That's good!  But then, GrapheneOS isn't being distributed through the Play Store.
20:37:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Well, we'll see how this pans out.
20:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> I know that Moxie Marlinspike has been very vocal in that Play Store allows him to have a separately airgapped machine for doing the signing with a hardware security module.
20:38:01 <TheJollyRoger> So, if that becomes non-optional, we'll see where this goes.
20:38:28 <strcat[m]> Auditor will no longer be distributed via the Play Store if it requires using their hosted app signing
20:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> The Captain has spoken!
20:39:19 <rosie> Moxie is the one who wrote Signal, correct?
20:39:25 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: yep, that's him.
20:39:34 <rosie> And strcat, you also wrote Auditor?
20:40:20 <TheJollyRoger> strcat writes many things that all fall under the GrapheneOS umbrella; Auditor, Attestation server, Vanadium, the Hardened Malloc...
20:41:35 <rosie> I know that strcat is very accomplished, but I'm still learning my way around the world of GrapheneOS.
20:41:43 <TheJollyRoger> It's a big one!
20:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> I often like to describe the GrapheneOS project as not being one monolithic thing, but rather, a combination of many individual subprojects that all work together in concert with each other to increase the security, resistance to exploits, privacy, trustworthiness and transparency of the Android Open Source Project.
20:42:57 <userx2020[m]> Hi, where can I find the list of supported devices?
20:43:06 <captaintofuburge> What's the best route to grab apks for an app without play? let's just say whatever app it is, doesn't have a direct download, and it's not on f-droid. apk can be grabbed off like apkpure or something, but what's the best way to verify it?
20:43:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hello userx2020[m] the best place to look is the faq at https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
20:44:33 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: Recall that Android does certificate pinning and it trusts the first certificate it finds. If you have an older version of the APK that was signed by its legitimate author, then you can upgrade from that by installing another one overtop it. Android will not allow you to install an updated version if the certificate that signed the upgrade does not match or is not authorized
20:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> by the certificate that signed the previous.
20:45:27 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: You can use apksigner included in the Android SDK to check the SHA256 fingerprint of the signing certificate used in the APK. As long as you can trace that SHA256 fingerprint back to the individual developers, it's already signed and verified end-to-end.
20:45:40 <TheJollyRoger> THe difficult part of course, is being able to go to the app developers themselves, and find out if that belongs to them.
20:45:49 <TheJollyRoger> Air travel at this moment may be difficult.
20:46:53 <Clutchward> Is there ANY support for graphene for ANY tablets?
20:47:06 <Clutchward> I read not due to some security standard things with their builds?
20:47:09 <Clutchward> but I'm unfamiliar
20:47:56 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: no, there isn't. GrapheneOS requires full support for verified boot with non-vendor keys, remote attestation, hardware-backed keystore, security chip, and hardware-bound encryption at barest minimum.
20:48:39 <TheJollyRoger> All the devices it supports, are the devices that have that with a vendor that has been very forthcoming and has actually treated GrapheneOS as a first-class citizen with respect to supporting non-vendor operating system.
20:48:44 <Clutchward> Okay. Seems best for end user. Thanks again. I donated what I could and hope it helps.
20:49:06 <TheJollyRoger> Clutchward: Yarr! We appreciate the gold, matey! On behalf of the project, thank ye for your support!
20:49:17 <Clutchward> Sure thing!
20:50:17 <TheJollyRoger> In theory, it'd be possible to port GrapheneOS to other handsets, and one well-kept secret is that GrapheneOS actually can compile and run on handsets that aren't officially supported. But without the vendor allowing us to rekey the bootloader, and without the vendor adequately supporting the handset, the device will have security equivalent to devices in roughly ~2014 or earlier, without the
20:50:19 <TheJollyRoger> ability to lock the bootloader.
20:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> Since it'd be missing hardware security features.
20:53:04 <userx2020[m]> Is all this hardware neccessary? What are the risks of building GOS for a samsung galaxy device?
20:53:04 <userx2020[m]> Isn't it better than staying with android on that device?
20:53:18 <TheJollyRoger> Security and trustworthiness starts at the hardware, so it's best we pick handsets with the best security and the best transparency to begin with; it wouldn't be worth it for us to try to work with handsets whose vendors are actually hostile or don't adequately support us running non-vendor operating systems on them and go out of their way to cripple important security features if we try to.
20:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> userx2020[m]: Well, If you build GrapheneOS for a Samsung Galaxy Device, what'll happen is Samsung will permanently blow an E-Fuse in the bootloader which will not only forever mark the device as having a voided warranty,
20:54:27 <TheJollyRoger> but it won't allow you to boot GrapheneOS without also disabling verified boot, hardware-bound encryption, hardware backed keystore, and remote attestation, and force you to run with 2014-era security.
20:55:42 <userx2020[m]> Thank you. So you are saying I'm more secure now keeping running google (!) Android?
20:55:58 <TheJollyRoger> userx2020[m]: in the case of the Samsung Galaxy, you're faced with the choice of either having Android on the device, or having a device that's missing half a decade of exploit mitigations and advances we've made in addressing VERY REAL threats.
20:56:24 <rosie> Crud.  I have a Samsung tablet that I would like to deg00gle as much as possible.
20:56:57 <TheJollyRoger> From the purpose of harm reduction, with that Samsung Galaxy you are better off with Google in your pocket, than having a device that's virtually open to the public... including your relative that claims to be Nigerian Royalty that needs you to send him money.
20:57:04 <rosie> Is there some way to mitigate at least SOME of the bloatware, etc.?
20:57:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: E-Fuse, what do you mean by that?
20:57:37 <userx2020[m]> <TheJollyRoger "userx2020: in the case of the Sa"> Ok I don't know what that means but it sounds scary enough.
20:57:59 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: I can't speak for many of the third-party vendors and OEMs, but Google clearly outlines what data it does collect in the privacy policy. Although the defaults do favour Google, many of the more invasive aspects of Play can be opted out of, or switched off.
20:58:02 <userx2020[m]> <TheJollyRoger "From the purpose of harm reducti"> 😂
20:59:25 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - an E-Fuse is a one-time memory bit. When enough voltage is sent through the E-Fuse, the E-Fuse physically burns away.
20:59:46 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - the device is then able to physically tell that that E-Fuse has been blown.
21:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> Much like a switch that you can only set once and then it's permanent.
21:00:19 <userx2020[m]> TheJollyRoger you write fast man! 😳👍
21:00:24 <rosie> Any resources you can recommend where I can read more?  I try to keep a close watch on app permissions and such, but I'm probably missing a lot.
21:00:25 <TheJollyRoger> userx2020[m]: I try!
21:00:31 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: I can't at this moment, sorry :(
21:01:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Does it show up some kind of warning, or does it become useless?
21:02:03 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - in the case of the older Samsung Galaxy handsets, if you unlock the bootloader, even if you lock it again, it will forever display "Your device is loading a different operating system" even if you attempt to revert to the one it came with.
21:03:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Hm. Not a big deal. Though it is almost certainly much better than having to deal with the now non-existing OEM unlock option. The thing was bugging me to update it. I did so and now OEM unlock dissapeared.
21:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - Samsung are very very hostile to anything that they themselves did not come up with, and they have this attitude of "we've got your money, you've got the device, it's your problem now."
21:03:10 <joeth[m]> <strcat "microG has security holes in how"> not to mention that their official ROM, lineageos MicroG is just Lineageos (which has lacking security) with a patch which allows it to fake signatures, weakening the security even further
21:03:37 <TheJollyRoger> So it's a bit of a badge of shame, which lets them know to deny warranty to you.
21:04:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: My entire family literally thinks Samsung is a good manufacturer. They are so naive. Though here at Venezuela the official warranty is pretty much useless because there are near to zero official repair stores.
21:04:45 <TheJollyRoger> I think Samsung at one point even used their own proprietary tools for this kind of thing. As long as they remain hostile to open source efforts, I don't want to even go near them.
21:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles oh yikes, I am so sorry to hear that!
21:05:40 <userx2020[m]> I really don't care about warranty but the other security issues you mentioned are kind of scary.
21:05:40 <userx2020[m]> Shit.. I don't want google or samsung in my phone what should I do? Get a pixel? 😶
21:05:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> <TheJollyRoger I don't want to even> Sadly, I do not have a choice. Dad just had to get me a flat-screen shitty Samsung.
21:06:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> For birthday, to top it off. Great start of the year (31/1), ain't it?
21:06:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> DD/M
21:07:13 <TheJollyRoger> userx2020[m]: yes, get a Pixel. Even on the factory operating system, Google doesn't load up their images with highly privileged third-party crapware in exchange for kickbacks, and they have been the most supportive of operating systems such as GrapheneOS; they fully open source all their drivers, firmware is available if you ask for it, and they have been very diligent in efforts to support
21:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> third-party rekeyable bootloaders. They also have the best security and best-in-class modem and device isolation and IOMMU mitigations.
21:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> userx2020[m]: on top of that, if you don't want Google in your phone, you can just run GrapheneOS (this is, after all, the official GrapheneOS channel, so naturally I'll recommend that to you). GrapheneOS considers Google Play services to be invasive and as a result, we do not include or bundle them, and have zero plans to.
21:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles yikes that's unfortunate man...
21:08:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> <nescientone[m] "I noticed this too. For example,"> Yikes.
21:08:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Not sure if I convinced him, but I tried to, and he says he is going to try to find the phone after he finishes some kind of business he has.
21:08:54 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles arr, best of luck shipmate.
21:09:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Thanks...
21:09:53 <TheJollyRoger> Ye be welcome!
21:09:58 <userx2020[m]> Ok thanks for all the info TheJollyRoger good night
21:10:13 <TheJollyRoger> userx2020[m]: Arr, fare thee well!
21:10:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> userx2020[m]: Pleasant dreams.
21:11:54 <TheJollyRoger> I'd best be off for a bit as well, fare thee well shipmates!
21:12:43 <captaintofuburge> shit was on the phone
21:13:26 <captaintofuburge> cert pinning. is that just taken from the app on first install?
21:13:46 <captaintofuburge> I'm not sure how it works exactly. so in my case, this would be a new phone with no previous installs
21:14:14 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: Yes, it's taken from the app on first install. This is a trust-on-first use arrangement, because it would be too much to expect every user would go meet up their smartphone app developers in person every time they wanted to verify an app.
21:14:49 <captaintofuburge> so on a fresh install, and side loading, you would still have to verify said APKs somehow
21:18:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Hey, Peter... are there any GrapheneOS archives? I could try installing an old GOS in a Galaxy S4.
21:21:55 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: you can do so by matching the SHA256 in the signing certificate to one published by the developers using apksigner.
21:22:27 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - you could, but I don't know why you'd want to do that, the archives date back to 2014.
21:23:02 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles it's likely to be a LOT of work and you're still only going to be as secure as those handsets are, and those handsets are missing over half a decade of exploit mitigations for their SoCs.
21:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> This, you can't fix.
21:23:11 <TheJollyRoger> Not without Samsung's help.
21:23:12 <captaintofuburge> that seems like what I was trying to find. I was just googling md5 hashes to see if something would pop up. but nothing useful to *actually* tell
21:23:54 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: Signal publishes their sha256: https://signal.org/android/apk but they are one of the few that do.
21:23:57 <captaintofuburge> odds are you can grab an apk off apkpure and not give a shit. but. would rather check instead of skipping
21:24:19 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: you could contact the developers via a preauthenticated channel.
21:24:25 <captaintofuburge> yeah, they do. some of the apps I need do not. not sure what to do about google authenticator. probably should just dump it
21:24:48 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I gotta run, sorry.
21:24:57 <captaintofuburge> thx for the help, all good.
21:25:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, ye be welcome!
21:25:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> <TheJollyRoger Not without Samsung's help.> Are you talking about the permalocked bootloader? No, that one is my current device, a Samsung Galaxy A01 Core. Dad bought it because he found it at like 90$
21:26:00 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles no, I'm talking about firmware updates for the SoC.
21:26:07 <TheJollyRoger> That, you can't do without Samsung's help.
21:26:23 <TheJollyRoger> Well, Ok, that does take into account the bootloader, but there's more to it than that.
21:26:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Huh.
21:27:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. This includes things like the chiplets on the SoC which power your phone's radios, GPU, talk to the SSD.
21:27:14 <TheJollyRoger> But look I REALLY have to get off the computer.
21:27:19 <TheJollyRoger> I'll return tomorrow!
21:27:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> All right. See you later.
21:28:44 <TheJollyRoger> o7
21:59:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I will probably wait until he comes back. I will have to look for a software for encrypting files. I hope the logbot catches this properly: apparently I have only managed to install manually QubesOS without encryption.
22:08:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I hope Molly-FOSS can be used on a semi-compromised device (bloated, malware won't connect to Internet, backdoors aplenty).
22:18:09 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1372623233682452486 deployed this accounturi security feature for making WebPKI less bad, hopefully Let's Encrypt moves it to production from staging soon
22:18:39 <strcat[m]> ideally... browsers would implement enforcing DANE TLSA records (at least the subset of pinning leaf via public key hash)

22:42:49 <jjj> hello - I'm running grapheneOS fine but I have a problem with SMS spam. Through the default phone app I was able to block all calls from those not on my contacts list. No such option exists for the messenger service, though I've read that the phone setting should in some cases also affect the messenger, it doesn't in my case. Is there any way to enable that setting (basically a messenger whitelist that only admits contacts)
22:42:49 <jjj> within the default grapheneos messenger app?
22:44:09 <jjj> otherwise, are there any custom apps? I can't seem to find any. QKSMS is popular for its spam but it doesn't have the whitelist style block and much spam gets through its filters
22:45:12 <dazinism> captaintofuburge: theres a load of details about how you can verify apps here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
22:46:08 <jjj> QKSMS is popular for its spam filtering*
22:49:26 <dazinism> rosie: its possible to uninstall pre installed bloatware using adb
22:49:57 <dazinism> Its not ideal to use adb, but in some cases may be necessary.
22:50:09 <dazinism> Best avoided if at all possible
22:50:14 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/adb
22:51:07 <dazinism> rosie search for "adb shell pm uninstall" and your device name.
22:51:44 <dazinism> Thats the safest way to remove apps that you can't disable via android settings>apps
22:52:02 <dazinism> Not at all necessary on Graphene
22:52:23 <dazinism> Its strongly advised to avoid using adb if possible
22:53:06 <AntiC> f
22:53:37 <AntiC> how od I login to my username?
22:54:26 <dazinism> Not sure you need to?
22:55:33 <AntiC> Well I have Clutchward registered and I'm not sure how to get back to it
23:03:16 <uhsa> hello, i just audited my graphene os device with a friends device(auditor) and how will i know if it didnt pass the audit we did it 2 times and only the second time the screen with the results on the auditor had a green filter does anyone know why not the first time?
23:03:55 <uhsa> and would i need to repeat the process in the future?
23:06:13 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: what you're seeing is normal behaviour. The first time, it's telling you with a yellow screen because it's saying,
23:06:36 <TheJollyRoger> "I haven't seen this particular device, so I am seeing it for the first time, but it's valid."
23:06:51 <TheJollyRoger> The green screen is saying "I have seen this particular device in the past, and the attestation is valid."
23:07:00 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if you see a red screen that means "This device failed an audit."
23:07:23 <TheJollyRoger> If you clear auditor or you clear auditee pairings on either device, then you will get the yellow screen again.
23:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> So, the easy way to remember it: "Yellow = Audit data is valid, but it's the first time I've seen this device's keys. Green = Audit data is valid, and I have seen this device's keys before. Red = something is wrong."
23:08:46 <captaintofuburge> how
23:08:51 <captaintofuburge> is that easy...
23:09:05 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa - you're welcome to repeat this as often as you like. Unless you clear auditor/auditee pairings, the phones will remember each other, and rely on those particular keys.
23:09:07 <captaintofuburge> Ah yes, Y for yellow, that means "audit data is valid" because I'm a roboty
23:09:28 <captaintofuburge> but also I would assume yellow is like "maybe look at this shit" and red is like "this shit is bad"
23:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: well, it means that it's relying on the signature chain from Google, it's a trust-on-first-use arrangement.
23:10:08 <captaintofuburge> just giving you crap.
23:10:12 <uhsa> yes thank you so it is advised to not only audit the device once but keep doing it with regular intervals?
23:10:16 <captaintofuburge> for the "easy to remeber" part
23:10:42 <TheJollyRoger> captaintofuburge: well, yellow does indicate that you're seeing a device for the first time. so if it's one that you'd expect was previously paired and you haven't cleared auditor/auditee pairings, you indeed should be looking closer.
23:11:30 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: If convenience allows. GrapheneOS runs its own in-house attestation server that can do that for you every four hours as long as your device has internet access, at https://attestation.app, and warn you if the device fails to check in after around a day and a half.
23:12:09 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: but it's great to do a local pairing, with someone you trust. This way you guys can treat each other as a sort of "trust point" if you have to.
23:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: not many people here have that convenience, so you're definitely lucky to be among the ones that have a friend who also runs GrapheneOS and can pair with you, haha! That's awesome to hear.
23:13:32 <uhsa> TheJollyRoger no he had a stock android device, does that matter for the security?
23:13:58 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa, it doesn't, so long as you trust the auditing device not to lie to you about what attestation data it receives and displays
23:15:28 <uhsa> so if i understand correctly the online audit with attestation.app would be more secure? I am curious for what threat model this would be advised
23:16:27 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa, local validation will be more secure because you only have to trust the device that's issuing the challenge and showing you the results.
23:17:22 <uhsa> i am a journalist in a country that doesnt like critical journalists so in the near future i would like to make a couple devices for my colleages. My country is known in the past to have used pegasus spyware on journalists. What can you recommend to reduce risk?
23:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> With remote validation, you can trust our attestation server, but you also must trust Let's Encrypt, you must also trust our colo provider, and you must trust the transport layer security validated by the certificate authorities *in addition to* trusting the device that will be showing you the audit data.
23:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: what I would suggest consists of a few practices:
23:19:03 <TheJollyRoger> The first one is, don't mess with any of the settings in GrapheneOS, and don't try to be a "power user." The settings in GrapheneOS are very carefully and deliberately selected in order to work in harmony with the operating system's threat model to maximize security and privacy, as well as take into account the big picture such as blending into a crowd of similar devices.
23:19:41 <TheJollyRoger> Any change you make to them, is likely going to countermand these design choices and make you less secure and less private, not more.
23:21:27 * zeothgze[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tjzrycgHPsACHDxXVDZVxWRm/message.txt >
23:21:38 <TheJollyRoger> The second one is, if you're a high threat model user, keep an eye on what apps you install and what apps you trust. Generally, the way high-risk users like yourself are compromised, is that your adversary tricks you into giving data into a shady app, or bad opsec, or snooping on unencrypted communications.
23:22:18 <TheJollyRoger> Use Signal. GrapheneOS always treats the network and cellular network as hostile, with one exception: avoid calls and texts made over the publicly switched telephone network. They aren't secure because everyone wants them to retain backwards compatibility to 1986.
23:23:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> How about briar?
23:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> What about it?
23:24:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> !X: Not as widely known / intensely scrutinised.
23:24:40 <TheJollyRoger> As fascinating as it might be academically, I'm not interested in an app that is synchronous-only.
23:24:51 <TheJollyRoger> Or that doesn't have automatic contact finding.
23:24:57 <TheJollyRoger> *automatic contact discovery.
23:26:32 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, users want the lowest barrier to use. Computers are a bother to them. If they could have their thoughts appear instantly in their addressee's consciousness, most of them would.
23:26:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> Thought it might be an interesting alternative for higher-threat users, but understand your points.
23:27:00 <uhsa> TheJollyRoger thanks for the info, i will be using signal and a second messenger i think wickr or if i can purchase threema anonymously i will chose that. The only settings i changed until now are the time to 24 hours and i switched to 4g only as it said on the website to reduce attack surface
23:27:00 <captaintofuburge> !X cocknuckles
23:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> @X, yeah... it's unfortunate :(
23:27:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> Why Wickr or Threema?
23:27:30 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: Good luck out there, eh? Stay safe.
23:28:00 <uhsa> hypokeimenon[m] are the ones i know off are there more secure options
23:28:39 <uhsa> TheJollyRoger I was also planning on using nordvpn with always on or would that distinquish me from other devices
23:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> Third one, be sure to keep up to date. GrapheneOS will let you know when updates make it to the server, each month the security patches are released, and it'll download in the background.
23:29:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> I am curious where you found out about them, but this is off-topic for the room now.
23:30:19 <dannyknoll3Danny> <TheJollyRoger "uhsa, it doesn't, so long as you"> Would it be accurate to say the more (hopefully) secure devices you have verifying each other, the better?
23:30:26 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: I actually don't really bother with VPNs, this is mostly a personal choice. All a VPN really does is move the man in the middle to a third party provider... who you likely don't know, operates under a different set of laws and jurisdictions (and as a result, may have little recourse to pursue if they turn out not to be trustworthy) and aren't regulated by law. Chances are it may only be a
23:30:29 <TheJollyRoger> shady shell company run out of a post office box in Panama by someone who will rinse and repeat shady business practices, then when they get busted, simply come back under a new name.
23:32:05 <TheJollyRoger> I know it sounds like I may be joking when I say that last part, but it's a definite possibility.
23:32:36 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: yes, the more secure devices you have auditing, the better off you are!
23:32:45 <uhsa> TheJollyRoger even with a big company such as nord or proton?
23:34:42 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: Still possible.
23:35:06 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa: VPNs are one tool in a toolbox to remain secure, but they aren't, on their own, a panacea.
23:35:26 <TheJollyRoger> They allow you to essentially move your ISP, and share an IP address with other people on that VPN, but that's it.
23:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back shortly.
23:37:22 <rosegreenway[m]> For such a high risk profile, wouldn't (always-on) orbot be more effective than a VPN to provide anonymity?
23:38:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Ahoy, Peter. I have a question. I wish to prevent any more Linux installation incidents. Has anybody tested GOS installation on a Debian LiveUSB with 4 GB of RAM?
23:38:24 <TheJollyRoger> rosegreenway[m]: no, because that's mixing the modes of anonymity which is something you definitely don't want to do.
23:38:43 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, I don't think you would want to do that.
23:38:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Bear in mind I seek to WebInstall on Chromium.
23:39:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: What
23:40:23 <uhsa> rosegreenway[m] i considered it but when i use tor now i use it behind a vpn router, tor would not make me stand out more i believe
23:40:41 <uhsa> would make me stand out more*
23:40:49 <TheJollyRoger> I honestly don't know how a heavily resource constrained live version of Debian running from USB is going to behave with the web installer. At worst, it might not have enough memory to flash and you'll get an error. You can try it, but I don't know if it'll work.
23:40:54 <zeothgze[m]> <TheJollyRoger "rosegreenway: no, because that's"> Wouldn't orbot be effective in always hiding the IP address?
23:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> zeothgze[m]: Hiding your IP address is only one of many facets of remaining anonymous. Let's say you tunnel everything over Tor, including stuff that's not intended to be Tor-aware. Now everything, like your connectivity check, time check, if you have apps that assume clearnet, they might ping backends, all that going over Tor.
23:42:19 <TheJollyRoger> You're mixing anonymity modes.
23:43:02 <TheJollyRoger> This is something the Tor developers tell you very specifically *not* to do.
23:43:29 <zeothgze[m]> OK
23:43:51 <TheJollyRoger> By doing so, you mix anonymous, and pseudonymous traffic, with your clearnet traffic, and cross-contaminate them all.
23:44:28 <TheJollyRoger> I've often stressed this before but I must stress it again: if you want to be safe and secure, you MUST use the tools in the way their developers and designers intended them to be used, rather than do hinky homebrewing assuming "more is better."
23:44:43 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, they were designed for a specific use case, a specific threat model, and a specific purpose, and make specific assumptions about how they are to be used.
23:45:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Guess I will struggle to get my laptop fixed then.
23:45:12 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, I can use a framing hammer to drive in a woodscrew, but that's probably not the best thing to do if I want my house's frame to hold.
23:45:56 <TheJollyRoger> I have to head off the computer so I will return later.
23:45:58 <uhsa> TheJollyRoger Does this go for me to i use tails for work related stuff and when i connect to the internet i do it via my vpn router running ddwrt with a vpn client?
23:46:06 * zeothgze[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mxvowuRqOWsWJqxfbDWUFXcR/message.txt >
23:47:14 <TheJollyRoger> uhsa, sorry, but this isn't really topical to GrapheneOS. You might be able to ask more at #grapheneos-offtopic, and other people, myself included there might be able to help you out, but I really need to step off the computer for a bit.
23:47:31 <uhsa> oke thanks for everything i will be there later on!
23:47:39 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. See you soon!
23:47:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: If I decrypt my other LUKScrypted OS while installing Qubes, will it be added in the multiboot menu?
23:49:13 <TheJollyRoger> zeothgze[m]: WiFi calling has to be supported by your carrier. Not all carriers support it. 3gppnetwork is not a default connection made by GrapheneOS.
23:49:51 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - I'm sorry but I can't give tech support for that, since I'm not standing over your shoulder and I am being dragged away from the PC by my ankles at this very moment.
23:50:14 <TheJollyRoger> I will see you guys later, fare thee well, shipmates.
23:53:24 <uhsa> When downloading f-droid from f-droid.org i see a PGP signature how can i check this on my graphene device? and the permission asked to download unknown apps is this only a one time permission?
23:57:32 <zeothgze[m]> <uhsa "When downloading f-droid from f-"> You can either:
23:58:19 <zeothgze[m]> Does this make sense?
23:58:50 <uhsa> zeothgze[m] no i just see this from your reply:   zeothgze[m] 00:57:33
23:58:51 <uhsa> <uhsa "When downloading f-droid from f-"> You can either:
23:59:48 <zeothgze[m]> Let me try again. Looks like Element has problems with the formating...
