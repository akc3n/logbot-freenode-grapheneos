01:47:16 <bizanon[m]> What is this?
01:47:46 <bizanon[m]> What are compatible apps?
01:57:20 <akc3n> bizanon[m], eSIM/DSDS
01:57:58 <akc3n> bizanon[m], Dual SIM Dual Standby
01:59:27 <akc3n> bizanon[m], However, if you have an eSIM, GrapheneOS doesn't have a frontend app to manage or configure it at this point.

02:27:45 <bizanon[m]> My pixel 5 has a simslot. And I use a physical sim. Is there an esim module inside my pixel right now? Or do i have to enable it first?
02:28:36 <bizanon[m]> akc3n:
02:35:52 <akc3n> It's provisioned in the phone's secure element, rather than in the operating system, there is a workaround by configuring it on the factory OS and enabling D2DS. This is a hack and not a permanent solution.

02:42:51 <bizanon[m]> Why is eSIM so coveted?
02:49:30 <akc3n> I don't have experience or personal knowledge to answer that one bizanon[m]. I'm sure a simple search would show you the pros and cons though.

12:33:07 <EV-9600[m]> Will there be a version of GrapheneOS with root? I want to be able to retain the automatic updates capability, but also make some changes to the OS, so what I hoped would be possible, is to install a version with root, make the changes I want and then lock the root access, that way I'll have the best of all 3 worlds (Automatic updates, full customization and security)

12:39:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't want another discussion on how the android security model works
12:40:16 <EV-9600[m]> I'm just asking questions and you aren't answering them...
12:40:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are only 3-5 processes if ever running as root on android and even then they are heavily restricted by selinux
12:41:15 <EV-9600[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "There are only 3-5 processes if "> OK so what?
12:41:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Rooting android is the process of adding a permissive selinux domain and allowing apps to transition to it

12:41:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> That in itself introduces huge security holes
12:41:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also root completely defeats the point of verified boot

12:44:10 <EV-9600[m]> What?
12:44:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: the only way to implement this is to always keep the hole around
12:44:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can't "seal" the hole at all
12:45:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> You also don't need a password for unlocking the bootloader

13:19:53 <Pratyush[m]> > <@EV-9600:matrix.org> Why? Couldn't the VM pass the real data from the device?
13:19:53 <Pratyush[m]>  * if VM will pass the data to real device, signature won't match again because real os not running unmodified os. see the point here ?
13:19:53 <Pratyush[m]> if hardware is running different os it won't able to fake it as  unmodified Graphene unless it is signed with Graphene official keys.

16:56:11 <EV-9600[m]> I am trying to fetch the sources again and after running repo sync -j32 it is stuck on:
16:56:11 <EV-9600[m]> Fetching: 99% [2 jobs] (787/788) finished platform_system_extras
17:10:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> How many user profiles can you have open at one time , if I switch to a 3rd, it ends the session on the first
17:11:57 <cliveptr[m]> That reminds me, how can I install apps in other profiles?
17:14:47 <akc3n[m]> <cliveptr[m] "That reminds me, how can I insta"> Fdroid? Apk's, Aurora even perhaps?
17:15:20 <cliveptr[m]> I tried installing F-Droid and got the all too helpful "App not installed"
17:15:59 <cliveptr[m]> I tried installing it over ADB once, forgot exactly what happened but it didn't work
17:16:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> How many user profiles can you have open at one time , if I switch to a 3rd, it ends the session on the first
17:16:37 <akc3n[m]> cliveptr: adb install programname.apk
17:16:49 <cliveptr[m]> Ok so I just sort of figured it out lol
17:17:17 <nscnt[m]> cliveptr: The apk provided on the index page is probably a lower version than the one you currently have installed. You can't downgrade. You need to get the version >= your current version from e.g. https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
17:17:18 <cliveptr[m]> If I open the APK directly from Vanadium I can allow unknown sources and install it, but if I try from the Files app it just fails
17:17:24 <nscnt[m]> cliveptr: Don't use ADB
17:17:44 <cliveptr[m]> Why not?
17:18:06 <akc3n[m]> Ya, I was just showing as an example. nscnt is right.
17:18:19 <cliveptr[m]> And I'm pretty sure I just installed a lower version of F-Droid on this profile than what's on my main profile
17:18:33 <nscnt[m]> cliveptr: That's not possible
17:18:44 <cliveptr[m]> Double checking now
17:19:00 <cliveptr[m]> Ok so it's the same version

17:19:15 <cliveptr[m]> I downloaded the APK a while ago and though F-Droid had updated since
17:19:22 <cliveptr[m]>  * I downloaded the APK a while ago and thought F-Droid had updated since
17:23:19 <nscnt[m]> cliveptr: You expose your phone to a huge amount of attack surface and control by your "trusted" computer with adb
17:25:33 <nscnt[m]> cliveptr: adb should never be considered for a phone that you want to call secure
17:26:29 <cliveptr[m]> even when temporarily troubleshooting?
17:29:32 <nscnt[m]> yes. you're probably reaching for the wrong tool for troubleshooting (whatever that may be)
17:30:23 <cliveptr[m]> how else can i get an error message when apps won't install?
17:32:28 <nscnt[m]> You've received your error message. You just didn't know what to do with it
17:32:44 <nscnt[m]> grabbing for a developer tool like adb isn't the right approach
17:33:03 <cliveptr[m]> ??
17:33:13 <cliveptr[m]> "App not installed" isn't a real error message
17:36:30 <TheJollyRoger> 2~Uunfortunately, that's what's upstream has decided to return as an error message.
17:37:06 <nscnt[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm not arguing about the informative value of the message
17:38:30 <TheJollyRoger> So if you'd like to change it, you can send a patch upstream to AOSP. That's out of our control.
17:53:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> speedkills588 (@f​ix5000) has joined the Telegram Group!
17:54:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Hello, may I ask about the exact way a forensic team can exploit a rooted grapheneos phone that wouldn't have happened if it was remained stock as the chef intended? I mean, technically speaking.  I know "rootin iz bad" but I am interested in a bit of why
17:57:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Or another question is.... Consider a rooted graphene OS vs a rooted LineageOS... Both would be "insecure" but is it equally insecure or is it still better to have a rooted grapheneos if non root isn't an option? In some countries, without modifying the modem files and other carrier configurations, you cannot get LTE.  Don't ask me why but that's how it is with android.
17:58:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<fix5000> Or another question is"> Impossible
17:58:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just being pedantic but GOS doesn't allow root
17:59:01 <TheJollyRoger> @fix5000 - I'll try and draw you an analogy...
17:59:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But if it did, it would be better than rooted LineageOS
17:59:23 <Railgun_Lover[m]> not by much but a little
17:59:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Hmmm so a part of the concept is the actual denial of rooting attempts(which would be what a forensic team would try to do to a seized phone, correct?)
18:00:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> That makes sense if that is the case.
18:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say I build a wall around house A that's twelve feet high, one foot thick, and made of solid concrete, but I don't install a gate. Around house B, I build a wall that's twelve feet high, made of boards, and I don't install a gate. Which one keeps people from breaking down the gate better?
18:00:58 <TheJollyRoger> It's a trick question.
18:01:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Got it, so boards would be just relying on "SELinux" and the locking code rathen than the verified boot, correct?
18:01:36 <TheJollyRoger> Not quite:
18:01:44 <TheJollyRoger> The thing is, app accessible root itself is a massive, gaping security hole that's mutually exclusive with a lot of useful security measures which GrapheneOS relies on.
18:02:06 <TheJollyRoger> So you want app-accessible root. Now you have to turn off verified boot.
18:02:35 <TheJollyRoger> No verified boot? Well, now all the handset security features that depend on it, are going to be disabled. This includes hardware backed keystore, which also means no remote attestation.
18:02:51 <TheJollyRoger> You're also probably using a userdebug build, which is not intended for production use.
18:03:22 <TheJollyRoger> Userdebug builds are instead intended to be used for application testing and OS debugging, but never for use.
18:03:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I see, so that's why Micay is recommending people who want root to look elsewhere... Because there's really no benefit to Graphene if it's not what the chef intended
18:03:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Correct?
18:04:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> It's either the whole solution or nothing, no half ass
18:04:38 <TheJollyRoger> You got it; remember that if you want to run GrapheneOS, you run GrapheneOS, and complete the installation by locking the bootloader, which ensures that your instance of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical to our existing binaries which are deterministically compiled and reproducible,
18:05:07 <TheJollyRoger> and are open to audit and open to outside scrutiny.
18:05:38 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to take GrapheneOS' source code, fork it, and roll your own, you're definitely welcome to! But we can't provide you with support for that, because that's no longer GrapheneOS.
18:06:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I see. I wish I could do something about those damn mbn modems though. Without flashing some added lines to enable IMS it won't register and this is a country where 3g goes offline in a month or two.
18:06:53 <TheJollyRoger> Well, what you could do...
18:06:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Is there a way to submit Google with proper MMC MNC lines for their modem? Is it Google that asks the operator, or the operator asking Google?
18:07:11 <TheJollyRoger> I'm actually not sure about that, so unfortunately I can't help there.
18:07:40 <TheJollyRoger> But if you know what functionality you want, there's detailed instructions on the build page for you to build your own. All of the source code, and all the packages for the backend, all that's open source and freely available.
18:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> So what you could do would be to build your own build server, create a fork, rebase GrapheneOS onto the fork, provision your own signing keys, and then host your own infrastructure; this includes the update server, the attestation server, etc.
18:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> Again, it's not GrapheneOS at that point, and it won't be detected as GrapheneOS since the keying has changed. But you'd be able to do it.
18:11:03 <TheJollyRoger> (You won't be able to self-attest using attestation server. You'd need to fork AttestationServer and Auditor and replace the keying with your own keys in order to attest.)
18:11:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I see..  I don't trust myself to do it as good as the GOS team anyway so I'll just have to nudge the operator to submit Google with their data so that they can update their radio
18:11:54 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
18:11:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> If anyone has info on how that works and how Google modifies their modem.img that would be valuable.
18:12:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> One last question, stock GOS has a per-app firewall correct?
18:14:35 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has a network permission toggle. If you turn it off, it will stop an app from reaching the network.
18:15:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Nifty!!!Thanks Jolly Roger for your patience!
18:15:25 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
18:15:30 <TheJollyRoger> Anything else I might be able to answer for you?
18:16:34 <TheJollyRoger> The reason that it's all-or-nothing is because if an app can query DNS, it can still exfiltrate data by sending malformed DNS Queries; this is why GrapheneOS doesn't do things like allow blocklists; it'd be far safer to simply deny everything, rather than simply enumerate badness.
18:17:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Well this one is a bit off topic but always wondered if you planned on adding the ACC open source module to allow the phone to stop charging at X percentage
18:17:51 <TheJollyRoger> I actually have a little something for you on this.
18:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on and I'll retrieve it.
18:18:19 <TheJollyRoger> So, this wasn't intended to be released to the general public because it's a draft, but now's a good time as any.
18:18:29 <TheJollyRoger> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Peter-Easton/4982f66e93387e02dd2c1d677d71f4f2/raw/4edf9a41ca3a4d053c8ad7bf365f97c923f01c61/battery-management.txt
18:19:01 <TheJollyRoger> TLDR: stop charging at 80% if you want to murder your battery prematurely.
18:19:27 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to maximize your battery health, keep your phone plugged in and charging at 100% all the time so it goes into idle maintenance.
18:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> It's not 2006 anymore.
18:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> If you try to manage your battery like it's the mid 2000's, you ought to know you're in some cases going to *double* the amount of load on your battery, depending on how demanding you are on it.
18:24:51 <TheJollyRoger> And burn through your battery's finite charging cycles by not using idle maintenance.
18:27:34 <cliveptr[m]> Interesting read, thanks
18:27:41 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
18:29:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I'm reading that in a bit! So the gist is that it's a myth?
18:29:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> with new batts?
18:30:16 <TheJollyRoger> "Charge to 80% to maximize battery life" was legitimate back in the early to mid 2000's, it will now wreck your battery today.
18:30:40 <TheJollyRoger> Since the mid 2000's was over fifteen years ago.
18:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> There's more tips on how to maximize your phone's battery life and why there.
18:45:30 <Jens85> Hi there, today I installed graphen for the first time. It is running now, but every time I restart my pixel 4a it gives a warning "your device is loading a different Operating System", did I do something wrong? Until now I have never connected the phone to the Internet after installing graphen
18:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Jens85, this is normal and expected behaviour.
18:46:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Jens85 that's normal
18:46:49 <janjaap[m]> <Jens85 "Hi there, today I installed grap"> That6 normal. Enjoy graphene!!
18:46:50 <TheJollyRoger> What the phone is telling you is that it's loading an operating system and verified boot is on and functioning, but it's not Google's operating system.
18:46:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> It does that whenever the key flashed to the titan m is different from the burned key
18:47:01 <janjaap[m]> * That's normal. Enjoy graphene!!
18:47:04 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship!
18:50:06 <Jens85> Hi everybody, thank you for the fast response...  :-)   So that means, that the titan m can not protect the new operation system graphene like it did with the google system?
18:51:05 <TheJollyRoger> It does protect the new operating system the same way it did with the google operating system,
18:51:13 <TheJollyRoger> it's just letting you know that it isn't the Google operating system.
18:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> That's all.
18:51:51 <Pratyush[m]> Jens85:  " So that means, that the titan m can not protect the new operation system graphene like it did with the google system?"
18:51:51 <Pratyush[m]> it can and it will, but it is informing you about OS changes.
18:52:09 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that screen turns orange and you get this ominous warning about "Software Integrity is not guaranteed!" that you have to worry. If that happens, you've unlocked the bootloader.
18:53:22 <TheJollyRoger> But you're seeing the yellow screen, so all is well. This is normal and expected behaviour and will not impact the security of your device any. If you want to check that the operating system is legit, you can verify using attestation server at https://attestation.app - the hardware-bound keys in your phone are capable of cryptographically attesting to the authenticity of the system image down
18:53:24 <TheJollyRoger> to the very last 1 and 0 of the operating system. If it's not running GrapheneOS, it can warn you.
18:54:48 <Jens85> Ah ok understood! thanks a lot!
18:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome, welcome aboard.
18:57:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I wonder if the GOS team can crack Titan and cash in the 1.5 Mil
18:57:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> 😍
18:58:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> ppff
18:58:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> That's the device they use.
18:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> Well, the Titan has a comparatively tiny attack surface, I don't think it provides any turing-complete functions that we can use.
18:58:42 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not saying it's invincible, just, difficult.
19:00:27 <TheJollyRoger> Although I've delidded credit card processors before, the Titan M actually has tamper resistant circuitry that will brick the chip should I attempt to remove the casing. Mind you, the Titan is tiny, it's about the width of a few pennies.
19:13:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> That's interesting, I wonder if Google make the Titan a requirement to be able to use the android license commercially
19:14:37 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think they've made security chip mandatory, but some vendors are starting to implement their own version of Strongbox Keymaster. I think Samsung has, although details on their implementation of it, I don't know yet.
19:15:30 <TheJollyRoger> I honestly do hope though that security chip catches on, especially now with OpenTitan.
19:16:36 <TheJollyRoger> So the barriers to entry are becoming lower, even though not gonna sugar-coat this, it costs a *LOT* to cast a chip.
19:28:18 <Cal> hi
19:29:01 <cal994> Hi, I'm having trouble installing GrapheneOS.
19:29:38 <cal994> When I do the command fastboot flashing unlock it just says < waiting for any device > and hangs there
19:30:00 <cal994> adb seems to work just fine for detecting the device though
19:30:36 <helloworldkk87[m> Use the Web-Installed instead
19:30:47 <helloworldkk87[m> * Use the Web-Installer instead
19:31:48 <cal994> That just gives me No compatible devices found
19:31:58 <TheJollyRoger> cal994: You're either missing the driver or your udev rules aren't set, or your USB slot on your computer is missing a trace, or your USB cable is not the Google OEM one.
19:32:11 <cal994> I even installed the google drivers through the SDK manager
19:32:15 <cal994> I'll try another cable
19:32:23 <cal994> unfortunately I broke my official one today.
19:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> That's rotten luck.
19:32:46 <cal994> yeah lol
19:32:46 <TheJollyRoger> So - note though...
19:33:00 <deadlydata[m]> hey what apk is incharge of UI within graphene?
19:33:02 <deadlydata[m]> systemUI.apk?
19:33:12 <TheJollyRoger> It's possible for you to do everything right, but the USB slots or firmware on your motherboard to screw the process over by not supporting all the functions of USB.
19:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't your fault if so; it's that a lot of vendors really cheap out and cut off corners.
19:34:02 <TheJollyRoger> So if you can, try switching around the USB slots (make sure you are NOT using any hubs, splitters, adapters, or front ports), or even try another computer.
19:34:06 <grapheneN00b> good evening
19:35:24 <Pratyush[m]> <cal994 "I even installed the google driv"> Installing from SDK Manager does't install udev rules.
19:35:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hello.
19:36:57 <grapheneN00b> I have just installed Graphene on my new device, can I ask a question regarding everyday use?
19:37:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, what can I do for ye?
19:38:12 <grapheneN00b> So this is possibly somewhere on the website but I have read a couple times and couldn't find it. System is up and running, and I assumed to use f-droid and the like for apps. Is there a recommended way to get apps or an app-store like f-droid onto the system?
19:40:15 <TheJollyRoger> The easiest and most straightforward way is to simply download the .apk via Vanadium and sideload it.
19:42:02 <TheJollyRoger> If you have a direct web of trust connection or you've previously verified the signing certificate of the developers/publishers, you can use apksigner included in the Android Software Development Kit released by Google to check the SHA256 hash of the certificate included in the apk, but that's only worth it if you're willing to go purchase a plane ticket and go and meet the publisher in person
19:42:04 <TheJollyRoger> and they have a means to prove their identity and ownership of their app to you.
19:42:34 <TheJollyRoger> So, just download the APK via Vanadium, and tap on it. GrapheneOS will nag you about security permissions, you will need to whitelist Vanadium. You can revoke that permission at any time.
19:42:52 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: just call it installing the apk not 'sideloading'
19:43:00 <grapheneN00b> Okay, thank you. Could you explain how this is sideloading though.
19:43:01 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Yessir
19:43:11 <strcat[m]> it's a term that people misuse like "ROM"
19:43:15 <strcat[m]> grapheneN00b: it isn't it's just installing the apk
19:43:18 <strcat[m]> just download and install the apk
19:43:28 <grapheneN00b> Okay, thank you very much.
19:43:29 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Got it, I will say "install the APK" from now on.
19:43:48 <deadlydata[m]> Hey what system apk within graphene is incharge of UI?
19:43:55 <ConfusedMammalM[> I have a question.Is there a video out there for the WebUSB-based method of installing GrapheneOS?
19:43:58 <deadlydata[m]> can someone point me in the right direction please
19:43:59 <TheJollyRoger> You just download it and tap it. It will ask you for confirmation.
19:44:50 <strcat[m]> deadlydata: there is no 1 app responsible for providing the UI
19:44:53 <TheJollyRoger> ConfusedMammalM[: There isn't, but all you need to do is click the four buttons in order, after making sure that Windows has the prerequisite android drivers, which should be found if you run Windows Update with your handset plugged in and on Fastboot, and you use a proper, high-quality USB cable
19:44:54 <strcat[m]> you'll need to be more specific
19:45:01 <strcat[m]> there's SystemUI for large portions of the OS UI
19:45:27 <ConfusedMammalM[> <TheJollyRoger "ConfusedMammalM: There isn't, bu"> Ok Thanks
19:45:55 <deadlydata[m]> strcat: Ah ok i see, what is responsible for system theme?
19:46:30 <TheJollyRoger> ConfusedMammalM[: It wouldn't be very interesting. It'd just show clicking a button, watching the download bar tick, then clicking the next button.
20:26:06 <cal994> got it. it was a driver thing. just reinstalled them and it worked
20:27:59 <cal994> thanks for your suggestions anyway :D
21:10:45 <MrSenshi[m]> Just thought I might mention that when using the dark theme, the "End Session" button on the lockscreen has white text on a light gray background.
21:11:15 <MrSenshi[m]> Poor contrast and also doesn't loom particularly good.
21:11:22 <MrSenshi[m]> * Poor contrast and also doesn't loomk particularly good.
21:11:27 <MrSenshi[m]> * Poor contrast and also doesn't look particularly good.
21:27:30 <strcat[m]> we don't change it from how it looks in AOSP

21:27:54 <gc> as
21:29:05 <covid-1984[m]> Where to find the list of apps (ordered) by battery usage in GOS?
22:05:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Graphene works great so far!Just so you know, the Pinch function is avaialble in open source by now
22:05:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Planned to merge it into PX4?
22:05:24 <strcat[m]> don't know what you're talking about
22:06:14 <strcat[m]> if you want answers to questions you need to invest the effort into making them understandable
22:06:38 <Thatcher[m]> I'm guessing Pinch = squeezing the sides of the phone
22:07:27 <Thatcher[m]> Active Edge
22:08:28 <strcat[m]> not present on current generation devices, no plans to implement support for a very niche legacy hardware feature
22:08:41 <strcat[m]> and we don't have Google Assistant or an alternative to it, so what would it do?
22:08:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!hermanito> Kann hier jemand deutsch?
22:09:14 <strcat[m]> it's an english channel
22:09:29 <strcat[m]> using other languages here won't work, can't be moderated by people who don't speak it
22:09:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!hermanito> Okay  do you know some German channel
22:09:53 <strcat[m]> other languages would need their own channels and moderators
22:10:02 <strcat[m]> not for GrapheneOS
22:10:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!hermanito> Okay thanks
22:10:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Thanks str, i was talking about thishttps://github.com/ProtonAOSP/android_packages_apps_ElmyraService
22:12:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> I can but not here
22:12:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> hermanito
22:17:38 <strcat[m]> active edge was dropped on current gen devices and was Pixel-specific so we aren't particularly interested in it
22:17:42 <strcat[m]> that's not the kind of thing we do
22:18:13 <strcat[m]> our focus is current gen devices + keeping as much parity as possible with them on older ones
22:19:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Yep, makes sense.  Kudos on the true dark mode!! Seems like everyone get this wrong for some reason. Well, this has been a successful install, i'm happy. Good night there folks from Europe!
22:20:16 <strcat[m]> dark mode is a standard AOSP feature
22:20:18 <strcat[m]> not something we made
22:20:27 <strcat[m]> think you may be misunderstanding what the project does
22:20:31 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
22:20:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Oh I meant in other ROM's, the dark mode is gray.... In fact, in all other ROMs i tried.
22:21:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> but i don't know why.
22:22:04 <strcat[m]> the theme varies by application
22:22:12 <strcat[m]> there's a base device theme we slightly change to be more like the stock OS
22:22:24 <strcat[m]> just change 2 of the colors in it
22:22:40 <strcat[m]> the defaults are essentially meant to be a sample for device vendors to change
22:24:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Affirmative boss👌
22:52:53 <jjstopper[m]> Grapheneos is awesome
22:55:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> I think it's 4
22:55:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Unsure btw
22:56:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> There's actually an AOSP constant that determines how many profiles can be active at once
22:56:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We could change it if really needed
23:05:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Yeah I'd like to be able to have more to be fair
23:58:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> I love graphene on my pixel 5
