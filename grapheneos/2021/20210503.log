00:01:01 <digital_sisyphus> Well, I'm a student, and there are some apps that I use (Canvas) that I just want to make sure would still be somewhat accessible.  I also read a lot of pdfs.  My school email accounts are through outlook, but I can access them with a browser and Vanadium sounds like a good one.

(I do have a decent amt of experience with command line and have used ubuntu as my desktop OS for years)
00:13:47 <digital_sisyphus> so thanks for ur advice everyone :)
00:14:01 <dig_nerds[m]> By the way, if GOS was based on AOSP, it should also worked on Sony phones.

00:20:25 <dig_nerds[m]> I checked it, it says only pixel phones were officially supported, I thought that was because no ports or nobody tested them yet.
00:22:32 <akc3n[m]> <dig_nerds[m] "By the way, if GOS was based on "> By the way -> Devices need to be meeting the standards of the project in order to be considered as potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems, standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available. Devices also need
00:22:32 <akc3n[m]> to have decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components such as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image processor, etc., because if the hardware / firmware support is missing or broken, there's not much that the OS can do to provide an alternative. Devices with support for alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be considered. Devices need to have proper
00:22:32 <akc3n[m]> ongoing support for their firmware and software specific to the hardware like drivers in order to provide proper full security updates too. Devices that are end-of-life and no longer receiving these updates will not be supported.

01:42:22 <dig_nerds[m]> Hello, is there any open source Chinese keyboard recommend?
01:55:23 <Math[m]1> Can one get MicroG on GrapheneOS?
01:56:52 <CaptainPicard[m]> Math: No
01:57:53 <Math[m]1> <CaptainPicard[m] "Math: No"> Okay.
01:58:27 <strcat[m]> you can install it but it won't really work without OS integration for it
01:58:43 <strcat[m]> having it around makes apps try to use it
01:58:48 <strcat[m]> since they see Play services is there
01:58:49 <Math[m]1> Right.
01:58:54 <strcat[m]> they use it instead of their non-Play code paths
01:59:00 <Math[m]1> I wanted to play Genshin Impact on GrapheneOS.
01:59:20 <Math[m]1> I am using CalyxOS because of that.
01:59:34 <strcat[m]> you can install microG, it probably won't help you though
01:59:41 <Math[m]1> Right.
01:59:45 <Math[m]1> I've tried that in the past.
02:00:09 <Math[m]1> Sadly GI requires Google Play Services.
02:00:19 <strcat[m]> it's not going to baked into the OS and would just stop working anyway when we move to Android 12
02:00:34 <Math[m]1> Right.
02:00:41 <Math[m]1> Dual boot?
02:00:52 <Math[m]1> Dual boot mobile OS?
02:00:53 <Math[m]1> It's unlikely.
02:01:03 <strcat[m]> it doesn't fit into the security model and update system
02:01:18 <strcat[m]> and again, would break when we would to Android 12 since the other OS wouldn't move as fast
02:02:19 <strcat[m]> the proper solution is app developers not depending on Google services being baked into the OS in an invasive way
02:02:33 <strcat[m]> either that or anti-trust regulation forcing Google to make Play services something that works without being baked into the OS
02:02:36 <strcat[m]> it could
02:03:08 <strcat[m]> installing the actual Play services if they supported that would work fine
02:03:15 <strcat[m]> since it's the actual Play services, no need to trick apps
02:03:25 <Math[m]1> Oh, really?
02:03:29 <Math[m]1> Would taht work?
02:03:44 <strcat[m]> it likely won't work right now because they don't support it running as a regular app
02:03:54 <strcat[m]> they require deep OS integration: special SELinux domain, various things whitelisted, etc.
02:04:14 <strcat[m]> but conceptually nothing stops them just making it work within the limitations and not offering things requiring that the OS has it baked in
02:04:17 <strcat[m]> most of it could work fine
02:04:39 <Math[m]1> Okay.
02:04:39 <strcat[m]> they don't do it because they want OEMs to have to get certification and make devices meeting their standards
02:04:42 <Math[m]1>  * Would that work?
02:04:43 <strcat[m]> comply with compatibility rules etc
02:04:57 <Math[m]1> I have to choose between security and anime girls?! weaslezbrothers
02:04:58 <strcat[m]> but it's more likely that there will be a future where actual Play services works on GrapheneOS than microG
02:05:00 <Math[m]1>  * I have to choose between security and anime girls?! üò©
02:05:13 <strcat[m]> like if the EU forced them to make it work as a separate thing
02:05:20 <strcat[m]> then you could just install that and it'd work
02:05:41 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't be that hard for them to support most functionality and just use a foreground service for push like everyone else has to
02:05:53 <strcat[m]> battery optimization exception request instead of hard-wired
02:06:32 <strcat[m]> I would be more comfortable setting up something to make it so you could install Play services in a specific profile and have it largely work than microG...
02:06:52 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't require the same things that break the security model
02:07:01 <strcat[m]> apps choose to trust Play services, that's their problem
02:07:10 <Math[m]1> Is GrapheneOS hardening significantly greater than default AOSP or CalyxOS?
02:07:19 <Math[m]1> Would it protect against attacks like PRISM?
02:07:33 <strcat[m]> but if we trick them into thinking microG is Play services and it doesn't provide the same security such as ignoring signature enforcement for components, no TLS pinning then that would be our fault
02:07:52 <strcat[m]> Math: it provides significantly better privacy and especially security
02:08:09 <strcat[m]> don';t know what you mean by 'attacks like PRISM'
02:08:33 <strcat[m]>  * don't know what you mean by 'attacks like PRISM'
02:08:53 <Math[m]1> Oh.
02:09:32 <strcat[m]> if an app works with microG it hardly depends on Play services and they could easily avoid the dependency
02:09:40 <strcat[m]> best to get the app developers to do that
02:09:54 <Math[m]1> I can't do that.
02:09:59 <Math[m]1> MiHoYo is apathetic.
02:10:22 <strcat[m]> that's a chinese company?
02:10:27 <strcat[m]> don't they have a variant that works without Play?
02:10:47 <Math[m]1> No.
02:11:51 <Math[m]1> Unfortunately.
02:13:03 <strcat[m]> Math: you've tried the chinese app store variants?
02:13:12 <Math[m]1> <strcat[m] "Math: you've tried the chinese a"> Oh, I haven't.
02:13:20 <Math[m]1> OwO
02:13:27 <strcat[m]> I assume they have a version that works without Play because I see it there
02:13:34 <strcat[m]> I don't know if it has english though
02:13:36 <strcat[m]> don't really know what it is
02:14:10 <Math[m]1> I think I need to play on Chinese servers to use that.
02:14:32 <Math[m]1> I would have wasted a lot of money and playtime.
02:15:03 <Hawk1291[m]> Is there something going on woth the graphene connectivity check server? I get "no internet" errors on WiFi with the graphene connectivity server selected. If i change to google server the error goes away.
02:15:58 <strcat[m]> it's working
02:16:38 <strcat[m]> broken Wi-Fi network? we do use new TLDs: .network and .online
02:16:46 <strcat[m]> should work fine
02:17:16 <strcat[m]> is your time set wrong?
02:18:11 <strcat[m]> Math: but yeah try the chinese versions of it, or similar non-Play versions
02:18:24 <strcat[m]> Math: may be one that works
02:19:32 <Hawk1291[m]> Its worked up until a few hoirs ago. I have been using it for the past few months problem free. No changes to network or phone. Time is correct. Even reset network settings for the entire phone and reconfigured the connection.
02:19:45 <strcat[m]> I mean the server is working fine
02:19:49 <strcat[m]> I checked
02:19:51 <Math[m]1> <strcat[m] "Math: may be one that works"> I will take a look. Thanks.
02:21:25 <Hawk1291[m]> Ok well thanks for the info. I guess nobody else is having this issue then. Will keep plugging away at it. thank you again.
02:21:46 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: it's happily working for others, looking at the nginx log atm
02:23:11 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: it appears fine from nginx log
02:24:00 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: can you connect to it on your other computers?
02:24:02 <strcat[m]> same network?
02:24:17 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.network/
02:24:20 <strcat[m]> should redirect you to FAQ
02:24:29 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.online/
02:24:30 <strcat[m]> that too
02:24:46 <Hawk1291[m]> Yes everything else on the network works fine just this one phone (the only one with graphene)
02:24:58 <strcat[m]> I mean try to connect to our network check server
02:25:00 <strcat[m]> on other devices
02:25:26 <strcat[m]> https://connectivitycheck.grapheneos.network/
02:25:31 <strcat[m]> https://connectivitycheck.grapheneos.online/
02:25:40 <strcat[m]> all 4 of those should redirect you to FAQ
02:26:24 <strcat[m]> we didn't actually start using the .online one
02:26:33 <strcat[m]> so ignore that, just check the .network ones
02:28:16 <strcat[m]> the reason it has a special domain (eventually we might use the 2nd one too) is because it can't have HSTS
02:28:34 <strcat[m]> so we need some weird extra domains like those for it
02:29:02 <strcat[m]> the iOS ones are super sketchy weird domains they'd seemingly reserved for other things
02:31:13 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: we did change something yesterday on our servers but you said it started today and it's the kind of thing where I can't see how it would have broken anything
02:31:20 <strcat[m]> and it's not specific to that
02:47:24 <Hawk1291[m]> strcat well just clicking those links i only get to the faq with the .online links. I get address not found for the .network links. that's on the graphene phone and a laptop.
02:48:40 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: well sounds like your network is broken and blocking / filtering those DNS queries
02:48:46 <strcat[m]> you should look into that
02:54:38 <faxing[m]> If Google releases a tablet that stands to the same security practices as their phones, is there a chance that Graphene might come to those devices?
02:57:55 <Hawk1291[m]> strcat: interesting. well apparently the issue is with quad9 as DNS. i temporarily changed my network dns to 1.1.1.1 and now the .network links work. so i guess quad9 was blocking those.
02:58:01 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: Yes, but only on the condition that someone steps up and commits to maintaining the device for as long as it will be supported by the vendor.
02:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: The rule of thumb is this: in order for a device to be supported sustainably, one person must step up and commit to supporting it for each device of that particular family.
02:59:40 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: should report it to them
02:59:43 <strcat[m]> please
02:59:59 <Hawk1291[m]> will do!
03:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: So, for example let's say that the Huasung NebulaTab meets the requirements, that means one more person must become a maintainer to maintain it. If the Huasung NebulaTab and PlusTwo meet the requirement, this means that GrapheneOS will need two maintainers, one for each device.
03:00:11 <strcat[m]> it all seems fine to me
03:00:15 <strcat[m]> but .network is a relatively new TLD
03:00:45 <faxing[m]> Alright, that's very helpful, thank you
03:01:01 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: Remember that a large amount of work on supporting a device for Android is specific to that particular device; it will require device-specific work, exploit mitigations, and sometimes, workarounds. GrapheneOS, much like Coreboot, must be ported to each specific device, in order for it to work.
03:01:33 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
03:01:34 <faxing[m]> Too bad what's being said about the project, it makes people not want to step up to the (much needed) task even though it's almost entirely false.
03:01:54 <faxing[m]> * Too bad what's being said about the project, it makes people not want to step up to the (much needed) task even though it's all almost entirely false.
03:02:01 <faxing[m]> Really disheartening.
03:02:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:02:29 <CaptainPicard[m]> For sure
03:05:41 <Math[m]1> Maybe I don't need Genshin Impact.
03:06:01 <TheJollyRoger> If you're unable to help out technically, what we do need, is positive presence on social media platforms. Presence, breeds presence.
03:06:31 <ypm[m]> What would it take for vanadium to have extension support? iirc there's an android chromium build with extension support but idk if it's actually functional or even if it is, if it's a big ugly hack and not worth maintaining. extension support would also decrease security i would imagine so idk if it's out of scope for the project in that case
03:06:46 <TheJollyRoger> ypm[m]: Vanadium will not have extension support, this is by design.
03:07:03 <ypm[m]> security reasons i suppose
03:07:07 <faxing[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If you're unable to help out tec"> Absolutely -- wish reddit didn't ban tor users or I'd try to work more on there.  I always try to correct people and publicly support the project whenever I can
03:07:08 <TheJollyRoger> Privacy reasons.
03:07:12 <strcat[m]> ypm: privacy and security reasons
03:07:27 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: Reddit doesn't ban Tor users at all, you just have to go to old.reddit.com
03:07:35 <TheJollyRoger> It's annoying but otherwise it's perfectly doable.
03:07:36 <strcat[m]> privacy: fingerprinting and persistent state via extensions
03:07:49 <faxing[m]> I've been banned three times son three different accounts using exclusively old.reddit.com
03:07:53 <faxing[m]> That's weird
03:07:55 <strcat[m]> security: persistent state trusted to have code loaded
03:08:05 <TheJollyRoger> ypm[m]: So, with respect to this, I've got a bit of a joke for you: where do you hide an elephant?
03:08:10 <ypm[m]> <strcat[m] "ypm: privacy and security reason"> understandable
03:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> The answer is: Within a herd of elephants.
03:08:18 <strcat[m]> both privacy and security: extensions have a terrible nearly non-existent security model and many are either malicious or incompetently done including major ones
03:08:33 <faxing[m]> I've never heard that before lol
03:08:46 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium aims to have the identical software and not only that, the hardware fingerprint of the comparable handset running the stock operating system.
03:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> This is in order to maximize your anonymity set.
03:08:52 <faxing[m]>  * I've never heard that before lol
03:08:52 <faxing[m]> (in relation to the elephant joke)
03:09:03 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yep.
03:09:08 <ypm[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The answer is: Within a herd of "> yeah i agree lol
03:09:16 <strcat[m]> it's very obvious if you have a website and use a strict Content Security Policy etc. because a lot of stupid extensions mess with the site to add ads and sketchy stuff capturing user data (incredibly popular ones) and Firefox doesn't properly ignore CSP for them as intended so you get CSP reports if you enable reporting
03:09:19 <strcat[m]> for all these awful extensions
03:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> It's a good way to describe the conundrum with browser individuality.
03:09:37 <strcat[m]> CSP reporting is in fact a totally useless feature in practice
03:09:45 <strcat[m]> you just get spammed with endless stuff extensions did messing with the site
03:09:48 <strcat[m]> totally useless
03:09:56 <strcat[m]> don't use any of those reporting features anymore
03:10:03 <strcat[m]> no use getting error reports from stuff like that
03:10:26 <rny[m]> i gave up tracking csp reports
03:10:30 <strcat[m]> unless there was a way to only get them from browsers without any extension granted permission to mess with content but of course then the extensions would probably undo that
03:10:35 <rny[m]> signal-to-noise really low
03:10:38 <strcat[m]> we use particularly strict setup for GrapheneOS
03:13:23 <TheJollyRoger> ypm[m]: So the reason Vanadium does not support extensions, is to keep your anonymity set the largest it could be. Even if you can change some settings in there, we don't recommend it.
03:14:58 <ypm[m]> <TheJollyRoger "ypm: So the reason Vanadium does"> What about if I prioritize anonimity<adblocking? I read the faq and bromite is recommended(?) for that. still true?
03:15:12 <strcat[m]> ypm: we intend to add a content filtering option to Vanadium
03:15:19 <strcat[m]> using built-in filtering engine
03:15:27 <strcat[m]>  * using the built-in filtering engine
03:15:55 <ypm[m]> That's good to know
03:16:16 <strcat[m]> I think a lot of extensions are probably broken by Trusted Types being enabled on the site now which is fun
03:16:23 <strcat[m]> I guess some simply remove the CSP header outright
03:16:36 <strcat[m]> and Chromium dealt with it by just ignoring CSP for their injected scripts for the most part
03:16:46 <strcat[m]>  * and Chromium dealt with it by just ignoring CSP for their injected content for the most part

07:13:05 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: I'd prefer not to stoke drama in this channel. GrapheneOS has and always will be focused on improving the security of the Android Open Source Project, and unfortunately it sounds like some people haven't wanted to see that happen due to personal vendettas or personal grudges against our lead developer.
07:14:40 <TheJollyRoger> I don't like pointing fingers when anyone who has the time to sign up for an E-mail address (if that) can be anyone on the internet, and I'd prefer not to stoke further fires. It's a waste of developer time that could be better spent developing better features, exploit mitigations, and improvements.
07:19:50 <TheJollyRoger> Discussions about other operating systems that aren't GrapheneOS are embargoed here, and discussions about vendettas and grudges are embargoed in both our channels, due to the way they often become inflammatory.
07:26:35 <TheJollyRoger> There was a disagreement, it snowballed from there, and piling on drama, ostensibly for other people's amusement, really just exacerbates tensions and wastes time.
07:28:04 <nscnt[m]> nonie689: You are missing several updates. After the last conversation, it seems that it might be faulty storage. We cannot help you in this case

07:32:25 <nscnt[m]> Savage waters, or what else drives you here at this time of day?
07:32:26 <TheJollyRoger> Honestly, with respect to drama I'd just like my drama to remain in soap operas which I can switch off whenever I get sick of them. I'd like to just get back to finding out about and learning about cool stuff and security, and the developers to be allowed to do so without being hounded over it.

07:40:36 <alan25> Is there anyway i can edit a torrc file on tor without needing root to get to the directory needed
08:09:52 <EV-9600[m]> You can specify a different config file

08:39:00 <spicy12> I ask because CalyxOS is not a "stock OS"
08:46:42 <dallemon[m]> what is the preferred way of sending donations? already doing github sponsorship, but i am thinking of multiple slightly larger one-time donations? (approx $100 at a time)
08:57:34 <Thatcher[m]> I think he strcat prefers Monero donations, but cash is fine too
08:58:28 <strcat[m]> any of the supported donation methods is fine
08:59:04 <strcat[m]> just don't use PayPal if it forces you to mark it as a purchase (some countries) and don't mark it as one if you have an option
09:20:46 <ishikawa[m]> <dallemon[m] "what is the preferred way of sen"> I usually use XMR,

10:32:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L‚Äã73689> Can someone look into allowing more user profiles be opened at once
10:34:26 <helloworldkk87[m> Just dont press 'end session'  and the profile will stay active
10:49:27 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <helloworldkk87[m "Just dont press 'end session'  a"> Only up to two secondary user profiles can be active by default

11:43:11 <panoramics[m]> Does anyone know if apps installed from aurora store are granted all the permissions it says they would have? For example:
11:43:19 * panoramics[m] uploaded an image: (130KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VQFWChzfsYUAudTyWouKDTRT/Screenshot_20210503-134124_1.png >
11:43:41 <panoramics[m]> Or does graphene still override access?
11:44:04 <panoramics[m]> For example, prevent from sleeping, sounds like higher level access apps shouldn't just have.
11:45:56 <Pratyush[m]> <panoramics[m] "For example, prevent from sleepi"> Prevent from sleeping is not higher level one, if apps targeted api level is something 29+ .
11:46:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> By default, they only have Network and Sensors permissions
11:48:34 <panoramics[m]> And by just installing them I'm not granting all of those rights?
11:49:13 <duck[m]> <panoramics[m] "For example, prevent from sleepi"> WAKE_LOCK is not a dangerous permission
11:49:24 <duck[m]> it allows apps to keep the screen awake
11:49:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Before you start an app for the first time, they are inactive, so you can revoke any permissions before the app is launched
11:54:40 <panoramics[m]> OK cool. I still don't understand the permissions description. I get it for network access or file permission etc. But it seems some of those things are granted by default and others I have to give access to.
11:54:40 <panoramics[m]> My question is, should I be concerned about those default  permissions when installing an app or will graphene do the choices for the most important stuff
11:56:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> just read this https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview
11:57:12 <panoramics[m]> Will do. Thx
11:58:45 <shibboleth> so, i was looking at the items in /proc/device-tree/chosen/cdt/cdb2
11:58:58 <shibboleth> i assumed these items were populated by the corresponding values in /dev/block/by-name/cdt
11:59:05 <shibboleth> however, changing the values in by-name/cdt+reboot doesn't change the values. any insights?

13:25:32 <janjaap[m]> There is an F-Droid implementation.
13:25:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You could certainly give an app access to contacts, etc
13:25:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But id say it's unethical to do it without asking your contacts first, if they're ok with it

13:28:33 <Golli162IQinform> Off the top of my head, it should work since it's just BTLE, but I don't remember if the OS or the App has to have the API for it.

14:16:39 <Leo[m]5> hello
14:17:04 <Wonderfall[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't come with microG nor supports it. To my knowledge the official German contact tracing app relies on Exposure Notification, perhaps microG includes it.
14:17:04 <Wonderfall[m]> (As for the location permission, it can be used for other things, but it's not something required by the protocol itself which relies on Bluetooth.)
14:17:04 <temp-12345> Any tips for troubleshooting a "No Internet" message for a perfectly functional WiFi connection? Enabling Private DNS used to cause this, but it's disabled and both connectivity checking¬† options do not resolve the issue.

18:31:42 <strcat[m]> you're building for 32-bit arm
18:31:53 <strcat[m]> there are no 32-bit arm Vanadium prebuilts
18:31:58 <strcat[m]> you'll need to build Vanadium first if you want to do that

18:32:26 <EV-9600[m]> I was just following that guide, I don't know why it chose 32bit
18:32:27 <strcat[m]> remove `out/` and follow the instructions again
18:32:34 <strcat[m]> you didn't set a non-default build target properly
18:33:12 <EV-9600[m]> From which step to start again?

18:39:38 <EV-9600[m]> I never even have the option to choose 32 bit arm
18:40:07 <EV-9600[m]> Maybe that's because of the DEVICE / BUILD_ID I chose?
18:40:31 <EV-9600[m]> I am trying to make a build for the Pixel 4a
18:55:39 <Pratyush[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org:  don't ask these question here may be #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  or you can pm me.
18:55:40 <Pratyush[m]> you have to choose correct device after  "source script/envsetup.sh"
18:55:40 <Pratyush[m]> like if you have pixel like 4 codename flame you can run "choosecombo release aosp_flame user"
19:04:00 <nscnt[m]> The build instructions are official documentation for which support is given here
19:11:54 <nscnt[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: DEVICE would be `sunfish` and the BUILD_ID `RQ2A.210405.005` for the latest version for the Pixel 4a if you were not sure
19:12:22 <EV-9600[m]> Yeah, thats what I used
19:12:23 <EV-9600[m]> Thanks
19:12:26 <nscnt[m]> When you need to move the directories, pay attention that the BUILD_ID directory will be lowercase
19:12:42 <nscnt[m]> So don't just copy paste
19:13:01 <nscnt[m]> use completion with tab or something
19:16:19 <nscnt[m]> Just as a side note. I don't really know what all can go wrong when trying to build and how to limit the scope for its troubleshooting then. That's why I'm personally not available for troubleshooting such issues, sorry
19:18:56 <nscnt[m]> Maybe I should let more of my builds fail :^)
19:35:45 <ephemeralang[m]> Is CalyxOS exactly the same as graphene except that it emulates Google Play Services with microG?
19:35:59 <strcat[m]> no
19:36:10 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have the privacy or security hardening in GrapheneOS
19:36:13 <alex-resist> It's quite different under the hood
19:36:25 <strcat[m]> they don't completely preserve the AOSP security model either
19:36:42 <ephemeralang[m]> I forgot the name of the one that's just like graphene but with microG
19:36:49 <ephemeralang[m]> What's that?
19:36:51 <strcat[m]> there isn't one
19:36:53 <candyman187[m]> I think Graphene is the best when it comes to security and privacy.  I have 6 phones and their all graphene except 1.  Which is an iphone
19:36:58 <ephemeralang[m]> Oh dang
19:37:09 <ephemeralang[m]> I must have misremembered
19:37:32 <strcat[m]> also worth noting microG does not enforce the security model the Play services APIs are supposed to have and therefore the OS making apps think it is Play services compromises the security of the data they send through it
19:37:58 <strcat[m]> if you took GrapheneOS and added it you would have to fork that to do something about it
19:38:04 <strcat[m]>  * if you took GrapheneOS and added it you would have to fork it to do something about it
19:38:09 <strcat[m]>  * if you took GrapheneOS and added it you would have to fork it to do something about that
19:38:39 <ephemeralang[m]> My job forces me to use the Microsoft authenticator app, which requires google play services. I had to dig up an old android smartphone because it wouldn't work properly on graphene.
19:38:44 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS also makes sure that privacy features we add work properly and cannot simply be bypassed
19:39:01 <strcat[m]> we don't add features which can be bypassed
19:39:08 <ephemeralang[m]> Is there a workaround?
19:39:29 <ypm[m]> <ephemeralang[m] "My job forces me to use the Micr"> ask for a company phone if they're making you install work related stuff
19:39:34 <strcat[m]> for example with our approach to the Network toggle which we do not see as finished either
19:39:43 <strcat[m]> there are improvements necessary
19:39:49 <strcat[m]> apps like Vanadium need to have enforcement for it added
19:40:00 <strcat[m]> the OS itself handles it properly
19:40:09 <strcat[m]> unlike similar toggles elsewhere which do not really work and can be bypassed
19:40:30 <strcat[m]> we need to improve Vanadium to enforce it though
19:41:58 <ephemeralang[m]> I could have sworn that someone on matrix mentioned a fork of graphene that supported either microG or google play, was this just a figment of my imagination?
19:42:08 <candyman187[m]> your imagination
19:42:19 <ephemeralang[m]> Dang, alright then
19:42:29 <candyman187[m]> all good bro
19:47:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L‚Äã73689> Yeah can this be increased
20:00:53 <flawedworld[m]> <ephemeralang[m] "My job forces me to use the Micr"> On a typical Azure AD // O365 setup you should be able to use a 3rd party TOTP app like Aegis instead - its an option during MFA enrollment
20:13:21 <jesqow[m]> Hello, my apologies in advance if this is the wrong place for this question: I'd love to use grapheneOS as soon as possible and enjoy all of its privacy and security features. However I currently do not own a Pixel device. I want this to be a long term solution, so a smartphone for 4-6years, maybe longer. Is it maybe worth it to wait for the next Pixel devices that are coming this year? How soon would grapheneOS be
20:13:21 <jesqow[m]> available for that? There are rumors of a google made SoC, does that have any implications support for grapheneOS, and therefor my decision? What are your thoughts?
20:14:31 <candyman187[m]> Well you can wait for the mods to answer, but if you're really hurting for a graphene phone I can give you one bro.  I've been trying to promote Graphene to all of my friends but with no luck
20:14:44 <candyman187[m]> And i'm just a newb.
20:15:04 <alex-resist> The next generation of Pixels *might* be supported for 4 years - at least there is a new Qualcomm chipset which will get security upgrades for that timeframe. But I'm not 100% sure if the Pixel 6 will use that chipset. I really hope it will.
20:15:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rumors say, Pixel 6 will get Google silicon

20:44:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
20:44:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> I want to ask you guys, what are recommended password managers for grapheneOS?
20:45:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> There is no official recommendation afaik
20:45:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Do keepass forks work fine? I still have to get myself a graphene device
20:45:35 <nscnt[m]> Sounds like a question better suited for #grapheneos-offtopic / #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:45:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> KeePass and Bitwarden are commonly referred as good ones, I believe. And yes, this is off-topic
20:47:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Pardon, I'm reading the rules as of now
20:50:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> I hoped that there would be an included password manager in graphene, but I guess it is not, sorry for the little off topic then
20:51:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> I would love to know what the devs of graphene itself are using when it comes to password manager
20:51:44 <nscnt[m]> @TheOnlyRealJonathan https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
20:52:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I guess, technically, Vanadium does sort of provide a built-in password manager (that is chromium password manager basically)
20:53:14 <strcat[m]> yeah we don't have the Sync and Password Check features though
20:57:14 <TheJollyRoger> @TheRealJonathan - apps work fine on GrapheneOS so long as they aren't hardcoded to be dependent on Google and are compiled against a more recent version of the operating system. Signal works great, Telegram FOSS works, KeePassDroid, KeePassDX, those all work fine.
20:57:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Thank you, but I think I'm going for offline password managers, I don't wanna be tied to the browser
20:59:41 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. You can use KeePassDX then, or KeePassDroid as you see fit.
20:59:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Alright, similarly my current degoogled phone
21:00:14 <TheJollyRoger> The only reasons I can spot for apps not running on GrapheneOS are:
21:01:47 <TheJollyRoger> A) they're hardcoded to be dependent on Google and their app authors have written them in such a way that they have no provisions to function in Google's absence. GrapheneOS considers Play Services to be invasive and so doesn't bundle any of that. In the future, considerations are being made to stub out the API and return a "Google is offline" error to apps requesting Play Services
21:01:49 <TheJollyRoger> functionality, but this is again, for the future.
21:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> B) They're old, obsolete, compiled against a version of the API that GrapheneOS has depreciated, or they make unsafe calls. Generally the latter doesn't really happen unless you find a really really sloppily written App that hasn't been updated for years and years.
21:03:40 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, your apps should run.
21:03:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Got it, thanks
21:04:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, anything else?
21:04:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Maybe yes, one more thing
21:04:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yep?
21:06:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Do you think it's doable to use a device with GrapheneOS installed as a usb keyboard using the linux kernel configFS capability?
21:07:36 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't tried that, so unfortunately I can't answer this one for you.
21:08:20 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that!
21:08:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Thanks anyway mate :D
21:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~
21:10:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> So when you connect a graphene device using usb to a windows computer for example, you are able to see and move files just like on android, right?
21:12:00 <strcat[m]> works the same way
21:12:06 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#file-transfer
21:12:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheOnlyRealJonathan> Alright, I apologize for the noob question ^^ just wanted to make sure
21:13:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, Media Transfer Protocol works, you just need to plug it in.
22:44:21 <hasnoname[m]> I tried to install an app on my main profile that's already installed on a second profile and I got a package conflict error
22:44:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> was it Fdroid?
22:45:05 <hasnoname[m]> Why did that happen while the storage for both profiles are different?
22:45:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> app downgrade protection
22:45:32 <hasnoname[m]> Aurora droid and aurora store apps
22:45:45 <hasnoname[m]> Different profiles
22:45:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> download and install the latest version of it
22:46:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you are likely trying to install the out-dated version of the same app
22:46:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and the downgrade protection is not letting you do that
22:57:05 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: each profile has separate instances of apps and app data but the apk is shared across them
22:57:33 <strcat[m]> and you can't install an older version of an apk, there's signature verification based on the key(s) of the installed apk and downgrade protection
22:57:58 <strcat[m]> this comes up as a topic regularly, you need to install an equal or greater version than what you have installed elsewhere
22:58:01 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "and you can't install an older v"> Got it
22:58:20 <strcat[m]> it also means if you update an apk in one profile it's updated everywhere
22:58:25 <strcat[m]> just how it works, it's 1 apk install
22:58:41 <strcat[m]> separate instance of the app and app data
22:59:15 <strcat[m]> it's done that way to save a lot of space without drawbacks beyond not being able to use old versions in other profiles
23:07:10 <sphinx[m]> hasnoname: https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=&ch=grapheneos&w=a is better
23:25:29 <fosswilly> hi, new fan of grapheneos here. I couldn't find what version of android the latest grapheneos release is based on. Is it android 11?
23:27:11 <strcat[m]> yes, Android 11
23:27:15 <strcat[m]> it should quickly move to Android 12 too
23:27:19 <strcat[m]> we've started early work on that
23:27:25 <strcat[m]> could really use more help with it
