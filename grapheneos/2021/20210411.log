00:07:21 <P-G> I'm getting hostile vibes, Strcat.
00:08:56 <strcat[m]> ok
00:38:36 <chile09[m]> getting Error: The device was disconnected on Flashing factory images step
00:39:48 <chile09[m]> device is currently showing fastbootd - grapheneOS Fastboot
00:47:18 <bingusite[m]> My device isn't being recognised when in fastboot mode, is there something I'm missing?
00:49:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hi bingusite[m], there may be something:
00:49:07 <TheJollyRoger> So, first thing, are you on Windows, or Linux?
00:49:30 <TheJollyRoger> Second thing, are you using the Google branded cable, plugged directly into your motherboard's rear port? (no hubs, no adapters, extenders, etc?)
00:49:33 <timetravelingman> Linux
00:50:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do you have the udev rules for your distro installed and did you reboot (or restart udev) after installing them?
00:50:51 <bingusite[m]> Windows, I'm not using the Google cable though as I don't have USB C ports
00:51:44 <TheJollyRoger> bingusite[m]: Alright, you'll need to either use the Google cable, or buy an Anker or Aukey USB 3.1 Gen 1 or later USB-A to USB-C cable, and your computer needs to support USB 3 or later.
00:52:00 <TheJollyRoger> Some other brands /may/ work but we don't know which ones are fully traced.
00:52:14 <bingusite[m]> Hmm, the device is recognised when out of fastboot though
00:52:34 <bingusite[m]> it's only in fastboot that the device isn't recognised for some reason
00:52:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Most USB cables don't have full tracing because their vendors expect users to only transfer files and charge other devices, not talk to low level debugging interfaces.
00:52:53 <TheJollyRoger> So they don't include those wires.
00:52:57 <TheJollyRoger> Second, if you're on Windows,
00:53:19 <TheJollyRoger> Plug the device in on fastboot, and while it's plugged in and on fastboot, see if Windows Update has any optional updates for you.
00:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> You may not have the driver for the LeMobile Android Bootloader interface.
00:55:49 <bingusite[m]> Alright, I'll try that after I get the cable then since it's not being recognised while in fastboot atm
00:55:51 <TheJollyRoger> Take note: when the device is booted to fastboot, it's a completely different device than when the device is booted to whichever operating system you've installed to it.
00:55:56 <bingusite[m]> did you say this one?
00:55:56 <bingusite[m]> https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerLine-Durability-Devices-Samsung/dp/B01GN0M6NE
00:57:51 <TheJollyRoger> That one looks like it should do it.
00:57:58 <TheJollyRoger> (If not, hopefully Amazon will let you send it back!)
00:58:33 <bingusite[m]> Alright thanks, will hopefully be back then if I run into any issues afterwards
00:59:15 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck. I haven't used that cable, but if it's USB 3.0 it should work. If it doesn't, send it back.
01:08:13 <chile09[m]> An operation that changes interface state is in progress
01:08:25 <chile09[m]> could this be because of the cable?
01:08:57 <plisk> I couldnt get the web based install go complete with any of the different google provided cables I have in my collection. A to C or C to C. I had this particular Anker cable that allowed it to run successfully on a Pixel 5 just now
01:08:59 <plisk> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07213D35X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
01:09:38 <chile09[m]> why wouldn't it work with a google cable that makes no sense
01:10:36 <chile09[m]> there's something fishy about this
01:10:39 <plisk> stumped me too
01:11:06 <plisk> the c to c cable from various chargers got it farther in the flash, but would still error out. anker worked first try
01:11:47 <chile09[m]> it just seems like this is a way to sell more products
01:12:04 <chile09[m]> because in order for the flash to work you need to have cable x
01:12:30 <plisk> im not smart enough to figure that out, Im just mildly competent at troubleshooting
01:13:02 <chile09[m]> it either works or it doesn't
01:14:16 <plisk> good luck
01:14:24 <ttamttam[m]> I had issues with my c to c charger, not sure what it was. A to C cable worked but it seems one of the traces was faulty because I had to hold it in just the right spot for it to flash
01:21:01 <chile09[m]> In my case, the USB interface is intermittently connecting and disconnecting
01:21:19 <chile09[m]> from the supported browser and supported OS
01:21:51 <chile09[m]> It's a shame I liked the idea of this project
01:23:39 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: if it's intermittent, it sounds like one of the ports on your motherboard is broken.
01:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> Or it has faulty firmware.
01:29:25 <chile09[m]> It could be the cable itself but it's USB-A to USB-C; tried it on 2 different ports
01:34:25 <crottor> RANT : I was taking selfies and comparing between the Gcam and Open Camera, actually I like Open Camera better. Gcam always artificially modifies my face and makes me look like a beaver. Couldn't find a way to turn that shit off.
01:43:37 <strcat[m]> chile09: your conspiracy theory about cables is truly ridiculous
01:43:48 <strcat[m]> chile09: please read the information on the page
01:43:59 <strcat[m]> it covers in detail that you need a reliable USB connection
01:44:15 <TheJollyRoger> crottor: Glad to hear you're liking Open Camera!
01:44:25 <strcat[m]> many USB-A to USB-C cables are faulty and drop the connection repeatedly, etc.
01:44:39 <strcat[m]> fastboot protocol needs a reliable connection to work
01:44:41 <rny> crottor: HDR+ makes your face look like a beaver?
01:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> I think increasing the focal length will cause all the objects near the center of the image to become bigger, but then stretch everything around the edges out.
01:45:26 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know if GCam does that.
01:45:33 <rny> that's a lens issue
01:45:40 <TheJollyRoger> But I think that's one way people taking selfies could end up seeing themselves in weird ways.
01:45:42 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, okay.
01:54:38 <crottor> No it's not a lens issue because Open Camera doesn't have this problem at the same distance
01:54:48 <crottor> I think it's due to HDR+ yes
01:54:52 <crottor> No way to turn that shit off
01:54:59 <crottor> Most horrible selfie app
02:00:30 <chile09[m]> going to try a different cable
02:32:27 <strcat[m]> dividend_reklamator: it can be turned off
02:42:58 <dannyknoll3Danny> Is the 4 XL known to have issues with the battery sensor/displaying battery info in Graphene?
02:43:05 <dannyknoll3Danny> Or is this a (second?) bad piece of hardware?
03:00:56 <strcat[m]> no known issues
04:50:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Morbid has joined the Telegram Group!
06:11:43 <christhepanda[m]> so would ther be a way to require both fingerprint and alphanumeric passcode on the phone to unlock?
06:23:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hello christhepanda[m], it's on the issue tracker: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 . We're hoping that someone may contribute this feature, pay to have it developed, contributed, and most importantly maintained, or with enough donations, we may put out a "feature bounty" on it, which has worked before.
06:25:18 <christhepanda[m]> coolio
06:25:51 <TheJollyRoger> Features, if added, would need to be maintained; adding a feature to any large and complex computer program is not a once-and-done type affair, but rather is an ongoing process that requires maintenance.
06:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> Especially where lockscreen security is concerned.
06:26:42 <christhepanda[m]> coolio, will increase my donation then.
06:26:53 <christhepanda[m]>  * cool, will increase my donation then.
06:26:54 <TheJollyRoger> christhepanda[m]: Woah, thanks man, you rock! Much appreciated!
06:27:19 <christhepanda[m]> how much would a good price be for a 'feature bounty?'
06:27:59 <TheJollyRoger> I hate to say this but unfortunately, I'm not a developer and I'm actually unsure how much work it would be (up front, or ongoing) so I unfortunately don't know how to best estimate that.
06:28:24 <christhepanda[m]> I'm gonna need this feature in a couple months, planning on travelling overseas, and having 2-3 factor authentication with something like a usb key would be a good feature imo
06:28:33 <christhepanda[m]> so i will start saving up.
06:29:00 <TheJollyRoger> The GrapheneOS web installer actually was contributed by someone who was paid the bounty via bitcoin. It worked quite well.
06:29:12 <christhepanda[m]> yeah
06:29:31 <christhepanda[m]> the web installer will be super helpful
06:29:43 <christhepanda[m]> getting a phone tomorrow specifically for graphene
06:30:08 <christhepanda[m]> don't have to mess around in the terminal anymore, just click a few buttons
06:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> I think with respect to experienced software developers on contract or freelance work, you're looking at at the very least paying something like fifty dollars an hour. Specialized knowledge, such as Android internals (which this will be) would no doubt increase that; I think last time I asked a developer for work, the developer asked for around eighty bucks an hour... but what I was asking for
06:30:15 <TheJollyRoger> was fairly specialized.
06:30:59 <christhepanda[m]> I'm gonna guess about $500 then
06:31:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The web installer will have your back, if you have any problems, generally most issues are caused by missing the driver on Windows, or substandard cables.
06:31:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, quickly, just for reference, your computer has a USB-C port, right?
06:31:40 <christhepanda[m]> no, I'm using an a to c connector
06:32:44 <TheJollyRoger> If not, hurry and order an Anker or Aukey USB 3.1 Gen 1 USB-A to USB-C cable; we can't use adapters or hubs to install GrapheneOS, since most of them don't have all the correct wiring and while they'll transfer files and charge correctly, they often won't talk to low-level debugging interfaces necessary to talk to the bootloader and do things like flash the operating system.
06:33:32 <christhepanda[m]> yeah, that's the cable i'm using
06:33:38 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great!
06:35:05 <TheJollyRoger> so, the good news is... if you are able to find a developer, you can certainly hire a developer to get the feature landed in GrapheneOS; this is a feature that's been requested a lot, and it's been on the issue tracker since almost day one.
06:35:24 <christhepanda[m]> yeah
06:35:26 <zh35hi[m]> heya
06:35:28 <TheJollyRoger> the hard part of course, is finding people who know Android.
06:35:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy zh35hi[m]!
06:35:41 <zh35hi[m]> I am about to get Pixel 5 for me
06:35:42 <christhepanda[m]> maybe a couple people could pitch in some money
06:35:44 <TheJollyRoger> Most of the people who do know Android and the Android internals very well usually end up being hired by OEMs.
06:36:02 <TheJollyRoger> So it's a matter of finding the right people.
06:36:08 <christhepanda[m]> yeah
06:36:17 <TheJollyRoger> zh35hi[m]: yep, that's a good handset for running GrapheneOS!
06:36:49 <zh35hi[m]> I am about to get Pixel 5 for my graphene experience. I am just conflicted about waiting the next iteration: will there be a significant increase in performance with the new model?
06:37:05 <christhepanda[m]> dude, next model wont come till like august
06:37:21 <christhepanda[m]> waiting does not realy make sense
06:37:29 <christhepanda[m]>  * waiting does not really make sense
06:38:05 <TheJollyRoger> zh35hi[m]: I don't like being a downer, but it's better you buy for your needs now at this present time and date. The thing about new phones is that just because they get released, it doesn't necessarily mean they'll be supported by GrapheneOS, and there's a reason for this:
06:38:22 <christhepanda[m]> there probbably won't be too much different except for a better processor
06:38:41 <christhepanda[m]> and it usually takes a few months to develop graphene for the new phones
06:39:02 <christhepanda[m]> so realistically, it will probbably be another year until the pixel 6 gets grapheneos support
06:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> If the objective is to simply get an operating system to boot, then that's not hard at all. However, to get an operating system to run on a phone, in a way that's sustainable, and can meet (let alone exceed) the security properties of a vendor operating system, is very much a full-time job for a dedicated maintainer.
06:39:36 <christhepanda[m]> yeah
06:39:56 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, people are generally paid six-figure salaries at OEMs to do this, and the GrapheneOS team is volunteering to do this because they see a need for this project to exist.
06:40:43 <christhepanda[m]> If anyone wants to organise, i'm willing to put in about $20 a month for any feature. on my budget. if we want any features, maybe we could organise a way to pool donations?
06:40:44 <christhepanda[m]> idk
06:40:51 <TheJollyRoger> Well, the good news is...
06:41:16 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has this! Donations made at https://grapheneos.org/donate go directly to the lead developer.
06:41:52 <christhepanda[m]> yeah, i'm talking like the feature ransom stuff
06:42:08 <christhepanda[m]> I already donate $20 to the lead dev
06:42:15 <TheJollyRoger> Ohh, for the specific feature.
06:42:18 <zh35hi[m]> ok fair enough
06:42:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, huh, I dunno.
06:42:50 <TheJollyRoger> zh35hi[m]: I would suggest when it comes to computers and technology, if you decide to hold out for "what might be around the corner," then you'll never stop holding out.
06:43:16 <zh35hi[m]> I am ready to checkout. Do you people confirm being no difference between models from different regions?
06:43:17 <TheJollyRoger> So buy for what you need at the present time.
06:43:33 <christhepanda[m]> yeah, I once waited a year for this thing I wanted, and it still is not here
06:43:52 <TheJollyRoger> zh35hi[m]: If you buy from the Google Store, you will buy new and can select Carrier Agnostic/Unlocked, and you're virtually guaranteed to get one that will work with GrapheneOS.
06:44:07 <TheJollyRoger> Anywhere else, you are on your own.
06:44:32 <zh35hi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "zh35hi: If you buy from the Goog"> I would gladly partake for that kind of 100% satisfaction
06:44:46 <christhepanda[m]> or, grab it secondhand on ebay for like $50 off
06:44:46 <zh35hi[m]> but I am from Europe, where Google doesnt ship it
06:44:48 <zh35hi[m]> iirc
06:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, shoot.
06:45:45 <christhepanda[m]> i mean, you could use something like a shipping service to get it delivered
06:45:46 <TheJollyRoger> christhepanda[m]: I advise against that, vehemently. While some of us have gotten lucky or fortunate, this channel is full of horror stories of people who have gotten ripped off by unscrupulous sellers that have sent them locked phones, then either refused to take the ends back or vanished.
06:46:35 <christhepanda[m]> yeah, the trick is to get proof, and look at the phone in front of them before paying
06:46:54 <zh35hi[m]> <christhepanda[m] "i mean, you could use something "> i could, getting uneven balance in shipping and taxes :P
06:47:10 <x-seraph-x[m]> In UK, Argos sells pixels sim free / carrier free. Not sure if that's any help to you
06:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> What generally happens is the longer a phone has been out, the retailers want to shift their locked phones as quickly as possible so they don't lose all their value.
06:47:23 <zh35hi[m]> Well I'll just contact the store, checking for compatibility
06:47:45 <zh35hi[m]> <x-seraph-x[m] "In UK, Argos sells pixels sim fr"> great, I am cheking. thanks
06:47:46 <TheJollyRoger> zh35hi[m]: note that some phones can be carrier unlocked, but bootloader locked.
06:48:09 <christhepanda[m]> can't you unlock the bootloader?
06:48:18 <zh35hi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "zh35hi: note that some phones ca"> mmm, and why would the bootloader unlocking be an issue?
06:48:21 <TheJollyRoger> Sellers often will not know the difference and the staff being paid eight bucks an hour to sling phones will often just check them all in the same bin.
06:48:32 <TheJollyRoger> zh35hi[m]: if the phone is bootloader locked, you will never be able to install GrapheneOS to it.
06:49:02 <zh35hi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "zh35hi: if the phone is bootload">
06:49:08 <zh35hi[m]> A tiny particulaer
06:49:17 <TheJollyRoger> Short of you finding a privilege escalation exploit, no "if"s, "and"s, "technically"s, or "but"s. It's a flat no.
06:49:58 <TheJollyRoger> (For reference, Android privilege escalation exploits can fetch prices of more than fifty thousand dollars to an exploit broker. So it'd be cheaper for you to just buy new)
06:50:45 <christhepanda[m]> well, i'll find out tomorrow I guess.
06:50:51 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck.
06:50:58 <christhepanda[m]> the guy says he got if from jb-hifi
06:51:03 <christhepanda[m]> so I hope that's fine
06:51:44 <TheJollyRoger> 5s haven't been on the market for too long, so your odds are good you'll get what you paid for. However, the longer the phones have been out, the more likely it is that retailers will flood the market with the bad devices hoping to get rid of them before they lose all their worth... so this creates a minefield.
06:52:00 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, it's always rolling the dice. Fingers crossed for you both.
06:52:10 <christhepanda[m]> yeah
06:57:51 <christhepanda[m]> oh, taking a look at the issue page, it seems that it is impossible to add a mfa unlock system without overhauling android unlocking. I would guess that this could be done, but only with money that is not available atm. ah well. lockdown mode it is.
07:00:26 <TheJollyRoger> I'll to bed. Fare thee well, me hearties.
07:00:35 <christhepanda[m]> night, me too.
07:25:15 <helloworldkk87[m> Nighty night. I just woke up (10am here)
08:44:53 <MdShakawatHossai> My smartphone is samsung s9+, is it possible install in this phone?
08:44:53 <MdShakawatHossai> Because samsung s9+ isn't garpheneOS officially supported device.

09:02:34 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> > Because samsung s9+ isn't garpheneOS officially supported device.
09:02:34 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> No, GrapheneOS makes use of Pixel's hardware
09:14:36 <rhymecheat> Sorry for asking this again, I don't think I got a response last time: has anyone else been seeing a loss of signal for the most recent update? My phone has gone to "emergency calls only" for my Sim ever since the update and I can't seem to bring it back
09:15:49 <rhymecheat> Other SIMs don't work either on my phone but my SIM works fine on a different phone
10:14:02 <sbstnsr[m]> so i bought today a pixel and it arrives in a few days so then im going to install grapheneos i only install foss apps but i see one problem. my bank doesmt have an open source app but i need it anyway cause they have a tan feature i cant use over the browser so whats the safest way to install this app without google play?

11:05:39 <Exilion[m]> Thanks, going to take a look at this
11:23:35 <xagki[m]> Hello guys, what do you mean when you say the pixel phone is locked/unlocked? Is it a sim lock or a lock that stops you from flashing customroms? Can you flash graphene on all sim unlocked pixel phones?
11:24:56 <xagki[m]> A local store sells pixel phones in my country sim unlocked, I'm afraid I'll buy it and I can't then flash graphene. Is that possible?
11:27:19 <xagki[m]> I'm in Germany, they sell them in Saturn and Mediamarkt. Has anyone bought the phone from there who can verify that their phones are unlocked?
11:29:11 <helloworldkk87[m> Here is Finland when I bought my 4a I just asked from the store are these the locked Verizone version or the unlocked Google ones. So I sugest contacting Saturn and Mediamarkt and ask
11:30:18 <xagki[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Here is Finland when I bought my"> OK, thanks. Let's say I buy the phone used, is there an easy way to tell if it's locked or unlocked?
11:37:04 <Exilion[m]> Im not surd if it is so, maybe somebody can confirm it, but in theory you can enable developer option and see if OEM unlock option is active

11:39:26 <psychologicaldam> xagki: they're unlocked for sure
11:40:10 <psychologicaldam> Second-hand you should ask them where they bought it from, if they bought it from some carrier them I'm not 100% sure
11:40:27 <psychologicaldam> Hardware stores in Europe should be a safe bet

11:52:37 <kaymot[m]> I'm curious about the privacy potential/ramifications of using the Pixel e-sim, with an account paid for with crypto. Any thoughts on this? Would we still be trackable by IMEI, and does it introduce new risks?
11:57:05 <catfish[m]> kaymot: this is not currently available in grapheneos https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159
11:59:32 <kaymot[m]> <catfish[m] "kaymot: this is not currently av"> Thanks - good to know. In terms of the potential/risks, any thoughts on the idea?
12:10:22 <nahman[m]> Why would you want to use esim ? It's not any more secure than regular sim. At least you can remove physical sim quickly if needed
12:15:25 <kaymot[m]> Well, this is why I ask - I'm curious about any pros and cons.
12:20:12 <kaymot[m]> Also, on a related point, is IMEI tracking considered to be a concern? That's to say, even if one changes sims from time to time to reduce tracking, can you still be tracked and by the modem's IMEI? And if so, is it known whether if one buys a phone in an identifiable way, the IMEI is connected to your identity?
12:21:25 <comradeskeltal[m> <kaymot[m] "Also, on a related point, is IME"> the SIM has nothing to do with your IMEI, the IMEI is hardcoded and cannot be changed
12:22:20 <kaymot[m]> <comradeskeltal[m "the SIM has nothing to do with y"> Yes, I know that. That's why I ask if IMEI tracking is considered an issue, regardless of SIM.
12:22:58 <comradeskeltal[m> I would say yes, but I'm not knowledgable enough in that field
12:25:10 <nahman[m]> Cell tower and wifi triangulation are already a thing. If someone wants to find you they can if you have a cell phone that is turned on. Or at least get fairly close. With 5g it'll be more precise.
12:26:09 <cursedshadow[m]> Anyone know how to get to the "root" folder? Can't seem to find it on the file system. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong lol

12:29:09 <kaymot[m]> <nahman[m] "Cell tower and wifi triangulatio"> Yes,  I understand that. What I'm curious about is the degree to which it's the IMEI that's tied to your actual identity, or the SIM itself. Or, to put it another way, does changing SIM achieve much, if the IMEI is tied to you in a persistent way?

12:33:33 <comradeskeltal[m> just to be clear, we are talking about the Google logo that appears when you power on the device?
12:33:53 <Exilion[m]> <comradeskeltal[m "also not possible,a s it has not"> I think he was talking not about bootloader, but the grapheneos logo after warning and google logo at start
12:34:00 <cursedshadow[m]> Well that or the grapheneOS logo that pops up
12:34:04 <kaymot[m]> <comradeskeltal[m "No"> So, I understand how there might be complications, but IMEI spoofing to the cell towers is not a possibility, in the way we spoof wifi mac?
12:34:19 <comradeskeltal[m> google logo - no, graphene logo - technically yes
12:34:45 <jpds> kaymot[m]: You'll find that changing your IMEI is illegal in most countries

12:35:22 <comradeskeltal[m> <cursedshadow[m] "What's the catch with the geaphe"> well as mentioned before, you would need to build from scratch and only change the bootanimation

12:36:36 <kaymot[m]> <jpds "kaymot: You'll find that changin"> Yes, that could be an issue, but I think that's more to do with permanently changing IMEI, with regard to theft. I'm not sure if temporary "soft spoofing" would be a problem.
12:37:13 <cursedshadow[m]> <Cliff[m] "The catch is i think if you put "> Yeah definitely understandable. I just thought it would be cool to change it up a little. Using graphene on a "spare" phone so wanted to play around with it

12:37:51 <comradeskeltal[m> it's a logo that you see for about 5 seconds once every blue moon. what's the big deal :D
12:38:22 <Cliff[m]> <nahman[m] "Buy a new phone and don't give o"> I don't think you have a choice in giving out imei and imsi numbers

12:39:20 <kaymot[m]> <nahman[m] "Buy a new phone and don't give o"> Yes, but I can imagine it wouldn't be that hard to figure out that an IMEI is attached to you, over time. I was thinking about a more robust solution.

12:42:43 <comradeskeltal[m> <kaymot[m] "Yes, but I can imagine it wouldn"> If some extremely dedicated adversary wanted to find out about you, they wouldn't need the IMEI, they would just need to correlate factors such as movement patterns, connection times etc. to deduce a fairly accurate result
12:42:49 <nahman[m]> Y'all are being a tiny bit extreme. Graphenes focus is on Android security and privacy....not "the feds are after me" tin hat I'm a hacker man bullshit. Go rewatch mr. Robot if you want to relive that.

12:47:21 <kaymot[m]> <nahman[m] "Y'all are being a tiny bit extre"> I think that's a bit unfair. The Graphene docs talk specifically about the risks of phones being essentially tracking devices, and how to minimise it. I'm not trying to be a "tin hat hacker man", and I'm not expecting the feds to be after me. I'm just asking questions about practical steps that might reduce the risks of commonplace tracking, that harms our privacy.
12:50:49 <cursedshadow[m]> I think we are all more concerned about data collection more than being able to physically track you. In that sense, yes graphene/other Linux based OS are better since they cut out google / Facebook. But that too depends on how you use it. They're giving us the tools to stay away from the people who gather and sell user data
12:52:17 <nahman[m]> <kaymot[m] "I think that's a bit unfair. The"> Maybe but you'll have to eventually come to the conclusion that as long as you have to have a carrier outside the wifi in your home your device will always need to connect to cell phone towers to get data. That kind of tracking cannot be turned off if you want data. In the US there is also the know your customer law, so either your real name or alias will be tied to you.
12:52:33 <kaymot[m]> I would consider the tracking of location through phone triangulation to massive data collection issue, and the docs seem to recognize that as well.
12:53:38 <kaymot[m]> <nahman[m] "Maybe but you'll have to eventua"> The way to mitigate that is to use wifi as much as possible, and communicate over data, not traditional phone coms.  I'm just thinking about how to improve on that further, by making it harder to identify that you've popped up somewhere when you need to turn the radio on.
12:53:42 <nahman[m]> <cursedshadow[m] "I think we are all more concerne"> I wouldn't recommend linux in it's current state. The kernal is highly exploitable. But that's off topic.
12:55:14 <nahman[m]> <kaymot[m] "The way to mitigate that is to u"> Then the issue falls back to wifi network and your isp. What can they see...is your home network secure....etc etc...
12:55:18 <cursedshadow[m]> <kaymot[m] "The way to mitigate that is to u"> I feel like the way Volk fone said their phones would work could possibly be what you're looking for? I didn't get too into the technical side of the tech because it relied too much on everyone around you switching to volk
12:56:34 <kaymot[m]> <nahman[m] "Then the issue falls back to wif"> Yes, but I'm reasonably confident I've got that side of things taken care of. ;)
12:57:16 <cursedshadow[m]> <nahman[m] "I wouldn't recommend linux in it"> True. Hopefully better things to come. People are moving towards Linux a bit more and might give devs a bit more confidence in spending their time and money into building a more secure version

20:38:54 <hyperio420[m]> I am testing a rom, sadly not GrapheneOS, and it comes with Vanadium pre-installed. It requires contacts and storage permission for some reason, that can't be disabled, "permission required to operate". Is this normal behavior for Vanadium Browser, or is something shady going on in the background? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
20:43:42 <TheJollyRoger> hyperio420[m]: Hi there, but it sounds like something seriously shady is going on.
20:44:04 <TheJollyRoger> This channel is specific to GrapheneOS only. We can't offer support for any other operating systems that aren't GrapheneOS.
20:44:08 <nscnt[m]> hyperio420: Vanadium pre-installed, but it isn't GrapheneOS? What kind of project would that be?
20:44:27 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, Vanadium depends on many of the security properties and improvements (including the memory safety) of GrapheneOS. It's not likely to work anywhere else.
20:45:08 <TheJollyRoger> It also doesn't require permissions to run. I have contacts and storage denied to it and always have had.
20:46:04 <TheJollyRoger> What's very likely is you've picked up something that's not Vanadium. Vanadium is not published outside of GrapheneOS, because other operating systems don't provide what it depends on. Even if it did run (I've gotten it to run before on non-GrapheneOS), it's not likely you would not see any benefit because it's not running on GrapheneOS.
20:52:25 <EmeraldMasta[m]> hyperio420: seems like something shady, but you should do some research on it
20:52:53 <EmeraldMasta[m]> What ROM btw?
21:03:25 <hyperio420[m]> I just came here to ask about vanadium browser permissions, not to compare roms. But if mods allow and someone is interested, I can link the project. I'll do further research about that. And thanks for the answers!
21:05:42 <alex-resist> hyperio420 those questions are connected
21:07:36 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, you can PM me the link.
21:08:27 <alex-resist> GlassROM contains Vanadium...
21:08:50 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium actually will run quite happily without permissions, though.
21:09:22 <TheJollyRoger> As would be expected though, if you deny it network permission, it'll still run, but you won't be able to do much with it.
21:10:36 <TheJollyRoger> Since it won't be able to reach DNS, won't be able to dial out, and won't be able to receive anything back.
21:11:55 <skwisgaar[m]> Even if vanadium is installed on another OS, it still makes no sense why it would be asking for permissions like that. Sounds like it isn’t actually vanadium.
21:12:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It most definitely isn't.
21:12:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> Jaguar ROM for OnePlus seems to ship with Vanadium.
21:12:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> Might be that.

22:31:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hi doubla, try interrupting the boot sequence ten times to force your phone to roll back.
22:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> If you've however sideloaded updates...

22:34:55 <doubla> TheJollyRoger, thanks for the input. So you're saying normally boot up and force power off with the power button (x10)?
22:35:29 <TheJollyRoger> doubla: On Pixels, generally the way it works is this:
22:36:53 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say you update to January. Partition A gets flashed with the January image. The next month, Partition B gets flashed with the February image. The month after that, Partition A gets flashed with the March image, and so on.
22:37:16 <TheJollyRoger> If say, April, Partition B gets flashed with the April image, and fails to boot after ten tries, the phone goes back to partition A and tries again.
22:37:24 <TheJollyRoger> However, you've been sideloading updates.
22:38:00 <TheJollyRoger> So I don't know you've now messed up that workflow. Someone more knowledgeable than I will have to answer.
22:38:33 <TheJollyRoger> So you're going to have to try interrupting the process ten tries and hope that you didn't break the phone by doing something that should not have been done.
22:39:14 <TheJollyRoger> Power on the phone, let it try to boot, when it hangs, reboot it by holding the power button to force it off.
22:39:18 <TheJollyRoger> Repeat this ten times.
22:39:30 <TheJollyRoger> If it rolls back and GrapheneOS comes up, super, let it update on its own.
22:39:36 <TheJollyRoger> If it doesn't, you may be out of luck.
22:40:53 <TheJollyRoger> Fingers crossed for you, shipmate... I hope it works.
22:42:00 <doubla> So I'm a bonehead haha, noted. I'll try your method and see if I ended up shooting myself in the foot.
22:42:06 <doubla> Thanks!
22:42:07 <christhepanda[m]> were you on stable version?
22:42:41 <christhepanda[m]> flashing it on my phone in a few hours, would like to know.
22:42:53 <TheJollyRoger> doubla: Good luck! Fingers crossed!
22:43:56 <doubla> I was on stable when it failed originally, then I tried sideloading the stable --> didn't work, then I tried sideloading the beta --> didn't work
22:44:03 <TheJollyRoger> doubla: oh shit.
22:44:07 <TheJollyRoger> I think you may have a hardware outage.
22:44:21 <christhepanda[m]> oof
22:44:24 <christhepanda[m]> which phone?
22:44:32 <doubla> Hm well that sounds like ass
22:44:37 <doubla> pixel 3a :(
22:44:42 <christhepanda[m]> ok
22:45:16 <christhepanda[m]> please update after the boot thing.
22:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> christhepanda[m]: I'm on the beta version, I've been fine. Beta versions are tested internally before they get released. Most of the time, there are no breakages, but occasionally the beta testers will catch small things; at one point earlier, a workaround was removed that caused the Pixel 3's camera to stop working, which the beta testers caught. Last year, the beta testers had to test a fix
22:45:26 <TheJollyRoger> for the Bluetooth audio, but that was it.
22:45:51 <TheJollyRoger> doubla: oh, jeez, I see :(. Fingers crossed for you... yeah, there is a problem with the 3a; the 3as don't use proper SSDs, they use eMMC memory.
22:46:20 <TheJollyRoger> It's considerably less expensive than a proper solid state drive, but eMMC memory has fewer write cycles and doesn't last as long.
22:46:30 <christhepanda[m]> well, hope you can recover your data if this does not work.
22:46:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, same here.
22:46:52 <TheJollyRoger> Google no longer does this anymore; a lot of people complained that the eMMC was too slow, so they now use SSD on the 4a.
22:47:15 <christhepanda[m]> guess i'm lucky then.
22:47:26 <doubla> I guess this is a lesson on actually backing up my phone.... but still never had a phone do anything like this before
22:47:39 <christhepanda[m]> yup
22:47:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The drive might be starting to burn out. :(
22:47:47 <TheJollyRoger> I'm sorry, doubla... :(
22:47:55 <christhepanda[m]> i personally just keep anything important in offsite backup.
22:49:11 <grapheneos_user_> This is why you do automatic backups
22:49:20 <grapheneos_user_> Otherwise you lose data
22:50:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. eMMC for device storage should never be done... hopefully Google will never do it again. The cost savings in using eMMC rather than using SSD for the phone's onboard storage is not worth the way that the eMMC can "burn out." TLDR: the chip will die after a certain amount of use.
22:51:41 <TheJollyRoger> I really hope it isn't this, but this could likely be it if there's been more than one flashing with the same results.
22:53:02 <christhepanda[m]> well, going to pick up my phone now, wish me luck.
22:53:15 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck christhepanda[m]!
22:53:18 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard.
23:12:13 <devdev> Hey guys

23:14:55 <crottor> <strcat[m] "dividend_reklamator: it can be t"> Not as far as I know for the pixel 5. See : https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77307629?hl=en or https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/j5f6ik/hdr_controls_in_camera_app_one_the_pixel_5/

23:50:22 <P-G> Hey, TheJollyRoger. Have you found any clues about that setting I'm missing? I'm happy to look for that setting in some repo if it would help.
23:50:50 * jegbehgpe[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mammDKsjzHPvhHuhcBtsRVuz/message.txt >
23:51:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hi P-G, I haven't got an answer for you on that yet.
23:51:26 <P-G> Ok. Would it help if I looked for it?
23:51:36 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
23:51:40 <P-G> I'm just not confident I'll be able to figure out what it's doing with the network stack.
23:52:00 <P-G> Do you know which repo it would be in?
23:52:01 <TheJollyRoger> jegbehgpe[m]: if I turn Network access to "Deny" for Signal, it crashes as soon as it opens.
23:52:06 <TheJollyRoger> I don't, unfortunately.
23:52:13 <P-G> Ok. Will dig.
23:52:23 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Please let me know if you find anything.
23:52:45 <P-G> Same to you. No pressure though. :)
23:52:50 <TheJollyRoger> Will do!
23:52:55 <jegbehgpe[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jegbehgpe: if I turn Network acc"> I know because some users here where kind enough to do the test on their phone and that's what they told me.
23:53:16 <jegbehgpe[m]> *were
23:54:15 <TheJollyRoger> jegbehgpe[m]: it sounds like your version of GrapheneOS is legit, if auditor is returning that it's an unmodified official release. I'm intrigued by this, although someone more knowledgeable than I will have to help you out.
23:55:00 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Google no longer does this anymo"> OK, that is one thing I should warn my dad about. Do Google Pixels have replaceable SSDs or something?
23:55:40 <jegbehgpe[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jegbehgpe: it sounds like your v"> Yeah, strange situation! Should I wait for strcat, since he recommended that I did the Auditor test?
23:55:50 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: No, the issue with eMMC is only specific to the 3a. It's not seen on any other phone. The other phones have SSDs that should last the lifetime of your device.
23:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> jegbehgpe[m]: yes, I think waiting for now would be best, I've never seen this happen before.
23:56:52 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jj1013.: No, the issue with eMMC"> Again, can I replace a Pixel's SSD without having to replace the motherboard/CPU/some other crazy thing?
23:56:57 <jegbehgpe[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jegbehgpe: yes, I think waiting "> That's what everybody told me a few days ago when I reported my problem! :-))
23:57:17 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: No, you can't.
23:57:27 <TheJollyRoger> Got it!
