00:14:55 <jeanblanc[m]> Hello... Is it normal for the google logo to appear at bootup?
00:16:11 <skwisgaar[m]> jeanblanc: yep that is normal
00:16:54 <strcat[m]> jeanblanc: it's the OEM logo of the phone configured for the bootloader
00:17:19 <strcat[m]> we're working on finding hardware partners to produce phones where GrapheneOS would be the OEM
00:17:37 <strcat[m]> until then, there's always going to be some other logo based on which brand of phone it is
00:19:27 <strcat[m]> we won't support a device without verified boot so we won't support a device where we have the ability to overwrite the boot chain due to it not being verified
00:19:41 <strcat[m]> you can look at the code and see where it loads the logo
00:19:57 <strcat[m]> not something we can change without having a device of our own
00:22:20 <Thatcher[m]> It will be a dream when Graphene gets its own hardware. I can't wait!
00:22:44 <strcat[m]> the goal is to at least push companies to make hardware we can use
00:22:58 <strcat[m]> and ideally they want to partner with us and we can have our own variant of it
00:23:02 <strcat[m]> or it could be the only variant of it
00:23:05 <strcat[m]> if that's what they want to do
00:23:22 <strcat[m]> we're actively working on finding hardware partners
00:23:44 <strcat[m]> we won't work with a company that doesn't have aligned goals and which isn't interested in making a truly secure device that's at least as secure as a Pixel
00:23:46 <strcat[m]> which is a high bar
00:23:49 <strcat[m]> and requires effort
00:24:48 <strcat[m]> it would certainly be easier if there were malicious people trying to sabotage things on a daily basis including contacting anyone who contributes to the project and supports us to manipulate or threaten them
00:25:00 <strcat[m]>  * it would certainly be easier if there were no longer malicious people trying to sabotage things on a daily basis including contacting anyone who contributes to the project and supports us to manipulate or threaten them
00:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
00:27:23 <strcat[m]> and btw I'd like to note what I said about new accounts just a while ago
00:27:26 <strcat[m]> and keeping an eye on it
00:27:30 <jeanblanc[m]> Ah cool... Thanks for info.... So it is possible for a fella to modify the code to remove the google logo?
00:27:38 <cankerwort[m]> Question: when I donate to GOS, am I strictly funding the devs or am I also potentially helping to fund the lawsuit against said bad actors?
00:27:54 <strcat[m]> jeanblanc: sure, you can modify the code, but you can't use it due to verified boot
00:28:17 <strcat[m]> the code is available - you can change where it loads the logo in it, it's clearly visible how it does it
00:28:27 <strcat[m]> but we only support devices with proper verified boot
00:28:38 <jeanblanc[m]> <strcat[m] "and btw I'd like to note what I "> Hey I'm a new account. Fresh off apple and found this element app on fdroid
00:28:41 <strcat[m]> so unless it's our device we can't change the OEM logo from the boot chain prior to where it uses our key
00:29:16 <strcat[m]> it applies to any device
00:29:25 <strcat[m]> and if it's our device, it's still going to be the case
00:29:32 <strcat[m]> although it's quite possible our 'logo' would just be a black screen
00:29:39 <jeanblanc[m]> OK it is over my head anyway
00:29:42 <strcat[m]> or the name of the phone model
00:29:48 <rny> whats wrong with the graphene logo?
00:29:52 <rny> it looks cute
00:30:02 <jeanblanc[m]> I love the graphene os logo
00:30:05 <strcat[m]> rny: I don't want to show a GrapheneOS logo if it's going to be booting up a non-GrapheneOS OS
00:30:20 <strcat[m]> rny: better to have black screen leading into the OS showing the GrapheneOS logo
00:30:20 <jeanblanc[m]> It just hurts my heart to see google logo load up
00:30:22 <rny> disable oem unlock lol
00:30:25 <rny> :P
00:30:34 <lokidoom7[m]> So many issures and we are talking logo on boot
00:30:38 <strcat[m]> jeanblanc: that's the brand of the phone
00:30:40 <lokidoom7[m]> *issues
00:30:50 <strcat[m]> jeanblanc: if it's an HTC phone it'll say HTC
00:31:00 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure why that would bother people any less
00:31:11 <strcat[m]> I'm sure it would, but I don't understand the reasoning
00:31:23 <rny> i think it's ok if the project is focused on selling high sec phones, it may disable oem unlock
00:31:45 <rny> if the user wants to oem unlock, ask them to sign a waiver or something and mail in their phone?
00:32:05 <rny> so the project brand does not get damaged if they do silly things after the fact
00:32:06 <jeanblanc[m]> Because I'm helping my friends,/an older couple to degoogle and deapple tbeir lives
00:32:44 <strcat[m]> why specifically those 2 companies?
00:32:45 <jeanblanc[m]> I told them to buy the pixel phones since it's advised on the graphene website
00:32:45 <strcat[m]> an iPhone is quite a good choice if you're concerned about privacy and security
00:33:20 <jeanblanc[m]> Trackijg
00:33:20 <strcat[m]> what about other big companies?
00:33:21 <jeanblanc[m]> Tracking /pricacy
00:33:21 <strcat[m]> what's the rationale?
00:33:43 <jeanblanc[m]> Also they deplatform people
00:34:41 <rny> jeanblanc[m]: how do they deplatform?
00:34:48 <jeanblanc[m]> Why support a company that ruins lives and businesses
00:35:10 <strcat[m]> I mean, that can be said about a lot of companies
00:35:16 <jeanblanc[m]> Yup
00:35:33 <jeanblanc[m]> That's for different chat rooms
00:35:34 <strcat[m]> you're using computer hardware in most of your devices partly produced by slave labour
00:35:56 <strcat[m]>  * you're using computer hardware in most of your devices produced by slave labour
00:36:17 <strcat[m]> so if the OEM logo was HTC would you feel more comfortable?
00:36:19 <strcat[m]> Huawei?
00:36:27 <strcat[m]> TCL?
00:36:33 <jeanblanc[m]> No
00:36:47 <jeanblanc[m]> But the point of degoogling
00:36:51 <strcat[m]> TCL is a state owned Chinese corporation btw, they made all the recent Blackberry phones
00:37:03 <strcat[m]> and I have a feeling if we supported a TCL device
00:37:09 <strcat[m]> no one here would be complaining about the TCL logo
00:37:16 <jeanblanc[m]> Means something a little different to some other people
00:37:34 <rny> not this again
00:37:36 <strcat> our goal is privacy and security
00:37:41 <strcat> not making people *feel* better
00:37:47 <strcat> we want to make something *good* not that makes you *feel* good
00:37:49 <jeanblanc[m]> Not that
00:37:59 <jeanblanc[m]> Branding for graphene os even
00:38:18 <strcat> we're not focused on branding / marketing
00:38:25 <strcat> it's not something we care about at this point
00:38:28 <strcat> it's early on in the project
00:38:36 <jeanblanc[m]> Look, graphene os is a brand that stands for removijg Google
00:38:37 <strcat> we don't have hardware partners and our own hardware being sold yet
00:38:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you want to feel good then *******.com is an option, just saying
00:39:00 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: no it stands for making a private and secure OS with Android app compatibility
00:39:02 <jeanblanc[m]> But its the first thing people see
00:39:04 <strcat> AOSP doesn't have Google services
00:39:18 <strcat> our work is not 'removing' Google
00:39:22 <strcat> it's privacy and security work
00:39:29 <jeanblanc[m]> OK
00:39:49 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "If you want to feel good then **"> The asterisk website did not make me feel better. Misinformation.
00:39:59 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: you bought a phone called a *Google* Pixel and you should expect to see the phone hardware brand on boot
00:40:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> madaidan.: Censorship
00:40:13 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: you could have bought another phone with worse privacy/security instead
00:40:21 <strcat> you're welcome to port GrapheneOS to other things
00:40:37 <jeanblanc[m]> I am fine with it
00:41:06 <jeanblanc[m]> But I got my friends sold on the idea and they gave me pixels to install it on
00:41:12 <strcat> ok
00:41:17 <strcat> I don't see the problem
00:41:23 <strcat> you're welcome to port GrapheneOS to other devices
00:41:26 <strcat> and to buy other devices
00:41:37 <strcat> you're welcome to support our efforts to have better hardware produced
00:41:38 <jeanblanc[m]> No big deal... Some people hate google
00:41:48 <strcat> we support the available devices offering the best privacy/security
00:41:50 <jeanblanc[m]> Yes surw
00:41:52 <strcat> other devices do not even have the basics
00:42:09 <strcat> GrapheneOS is never going to attach our name to something awful
00:42:24 <strcat> we won't have official support for an insecure device
00:42:36 <strcat> there is a standard that has to be met for officially supported devices
00:42:41 <strcat> including a device built to run GrapheneOS
00:43:05 <strcat> there is no point of us having a company build a device to run GrapheneOS that offers worse privacy/security and has a price premium due to being a much smaller scale thing
00:43:20 <cankerwort[m]> <strcat "you're welcome to support our ef"> How can the average human do this at this point?
00:43:25 <strcat> we wouldn't attach our name to an insecure phone
00:44:05 <strcat> you can contribute to one of the many projects we develop, you can help counter the malicious people trying to harm the project, you can donate to support more developers
00:44:11 <jeanblanc[m]> Well all  saying is it would be amazing if one didn't see the Google logo
00:44:26 <jeanblanc[m]> I love the project
00:44:32 <jeanblanc[m]> And thank you guys
00:44:36 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: it would be amazing if we had our own device more secure than Pixels but as is Pixels are the most secure devices available to us, by far, and other devices are insecure
00:45:01 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: and we're not going to support an insecure device just so you feel better about the logo loaded by edk2
00:45:06 <cankerwort[m]> <strcat "you can contribute to one of the"> Looks like I shall continue to do 2 & 3
00:45:09 <Thatcher[m]> <jeanblanc[m] "Well all  saying is it would be "> I like the Google logo, it lets me know I'm using one of the officially supported devices
00:45:30 <strcat> I really don't see why this is a topic of conversation
00:45:31 <jeanblanc[m]> Just an FYI
00:45:37 <strcat> why not talk about the efforts to partner with hardware companies
00:45:50 <jeanblanc[m]> I discovered graphene from a YouTube video
00:45:55 <strcat> and I'm quite suspicious that in quick progression, several new people join and want to talk about this
00:45:58 <jeanblanc[m]> Braxman
00:46:04 <TheJollyRoger> jeanblanc[m]: That part, is signed and verified, we can't change it.
00:46:13 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: strongly recommend finding a better source of info
00:46:23 <Thatcher[m]> I can't stand Braxman
00:46:40 <strcat> jeanblanc[m]: that's not an expert and he regularly makes false claims, including about our project
00:46:55 <cankerwort[m]> Braxman seems to cover some basics but then quickly switches to shilling his own side gigs, never much real detail
00:47:22 <jeanblanc[m]> Well then also the title of the video was.misleading
00:48:43 <strcat> best not to talk about that here
00:48:50 <jeanblanc[m]> Degoogle... Led to subsequent internet searches, decided to go with graphene.
00:48:54 <strcat> it's not a good source of information, there are a lot of errors and a lot of bullshitting
00:49:18 <strcat> please don't link to those videos here and it's best if we talk about something else
00:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir.
00:49:37 <jeanblanc[m]> Well I am talking here on my pixel 4a running graphene os so that's good news for me
00:49:43 <rahoon_goaway[m]> I joined here because I just started using matrix after getting a pixel and installing grapheneOS on it
00:49:55 <jeanblanc[m]> <rahoon_goaway[m] "I joined here because I just sta"> Me too
00:49:59 <rahoon_goaway[m]> And I have to say, is very nice so far
00:50:07 <TheJollyRoger> That's excellent to hear!
00:50:41 <TheJollyRoger> I first joined here because I've been a fan of the project for a long time and enjoy using it as well and chatting with other people who do as well.
00:50:43 <jeanblanc[m]> I just joined the group because i wanna know more
00:50:43 <strcat[m]> jeanblanc: look at https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400
00:50:44 <jeanblanc[m]> Maybe there could be a channel for newbiea
00:51:14 <rahoon_goaway[m]>  I came from lineageOS, I'm curious if any of the LOS apps can be installed hete?
00:51:29 <rahoon_goaway[m]> Like audioFX, the equalizer app
00:51:30 <TheJollyRoger> jeanblanc[m]: Heh, well, currently the best way for newbies to start, is with the FAQs, and usually Daniel Micay's twitter page.
00:52:01 <jeanblanc[m]> OK I'll.check it out
00:52:05 <jeanblanc[m]> Thanks
00:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> jeanblanc[m]: anytime. If you have questions about the system, usually the FAQ does a far better and more accurate job at describing the nuances than I can on my IRC client.
00:53:25 <jeanblanc[m]> Hehe oki
00:53:47 <jeanblanc[m]> In was a little excited to try this
00:54:09 <jeanblanc[m]> I'll come.back after in learn morw
00:54:16 <TheJollyRoger> rahoon_goaway[m]: I've actually never used Lineage. I suppose you could try pulling the APKs from wherever their repositories are, and giving them a try, but I would not be surprised if they won't, or don't run. LineageOS and GrapheneOS are extremely different operating systems and have almost mutually exclusive goals.
00:54:21 <jeanblanc[m]> Bye and thank you so much
00:54:27 <TheJollyRoger> Cheers jeanblanc[m]
00:55:36 <TheJollyRoger> rahoon_goaway[m]: GrapheneOS is a strictly security focused project, so a large amount of efforts focus on correctness of the implementations, safe-by-default settings, restrictive security policies to mitigate and prevent exploits, and ensuring that we don't simply transfer the responsibility for safe practices onto the user.
00:57:01 <extrainordinaryt> Did grapheme abandoned the purple mountain wallpaper?
00:57:06 <rahoon_goaway[m]> <TheJollyRoger "rahoon_goaway: I've actually nev"> Well the thing is I haven't found out where they keep those.. They seem to be baked into LOS somewhere and not available separately
00:57:07 <TheJollyRoger> LineageOS on the other hand, is for people who would like to play Sysadmin with their phones, so LineageOS considers app-accessible or adb-accessible root, which destroys the Android security model, to be a desirable feature, and significantly reduces the restrictiveness of their --
00:57:37 <TheJollyRoger> extrainordinaryt: yes, we figured it was time for a change. If you've changed the default wallpaper yourself, it won't affect you, but if you haven't changed it and just left it at the default, it's now a black screen.
00:57:47 <eoo9> Hey does anyone know how to get browser notifications to show from vanadium or bromite?
00:57:59 <TheJollyRoger> The entry should be listed under changelogs.
00:58:03 <extrainordinaryt> <TheJollyRoger "extrainordinarytimes: yes, we fi"> I see thanks
00:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> extrainordinaryt: yep!
01:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> rahoon_goaway[m]: and significantly reduces the restrictiveness of their SELinux Mandatory Access Control policies in order to allow you to stuff that normally would violate the security policies and controls. This is why I say that the two projects are very different and aren't intended to compete with each other.
01:00:44 <eoo9> Is there a better channel where I should ask my question?
01:00:48 <TheJollyRoger> rahoon_goaway[m]: I wouldn't know where to start with those.
01:01:23 <Thatcher[m]> I came to Graphene and this community because I'm a fan of the project, but it has also inspired me to initiate a self-educated path toward a more computer literate set of skills for the means of contributing to open source projects and shifting my career objectives to things not specifically pertaining to fixing toilets and cleaning shitpipes.
01:01:35 <TheJollyRoger> eoo9: probably right here, and just wait until someone can get around to you. I see notifications from Vanadium just fine, when I'm downloading something, do you have them muted?
01:01:55 <strcat> btw we're doing a new Vanadium release + OS release soon
01:01:57 <TheJollyRoger> Thatcher[m]: you rock! That's awesome to hear, I'm hoping I can join you on that journey.
01:02:03 <strcat> emergency release of Chromium today
01:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, yikes. Got it.
01:02:13 <strcat> it's likely more important on Windows
01:02:25 <TheJollyRoger> o.O Oh wow.
01:18:53 <plowdownfarmon> hello.  moving from iphone to graphene pixel4a.  currently a lastpass user and looking for a program that i can run on linux and graphene so i can manually transfer info from lastpass on laptop then it syncs with the apk on phone.  make sense?  please let me know your thoughts.  thanks.
01:20:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy plowdownfarmon, you can simply transfer files from your computer to your phone using MTP.
01:20:40 <TheJollyRoger> Just plug it in, and you'll see a drop down. You want to select "File Transfer."
01:20:46 <TheJollyRoger> No apps or third-party processes needed.
01:21:23 <TheJollyRoger> Then from there you can send files to it through Windows Explorer (or GNOME Shell/xfce4/KDE what have you)
01:40:47 <plowdownfarmon> TheJollyRoger thanks so much.  i will take a look!  cheers
01:42:01 <TheJollyRoger> plowdownfarmon: of course! Hope this all works for you!
01:42:35 <strcat[m]> we're likely going to have experimental Pixel 5 and 4a 5G releases soon
01:42:45 <strcat[m]> but we're not ready to make it stable and do regular releases
01:42:49 <strcat[m]> lack resources atm
01:43:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1 is working on it
01:43:27 <thetranstocommie> congrats!!
01:44:24 <grapheneos_user_> Ayyyy!
01:44:53 <grapheneos_user_> Its a victory nonetheless, even if you cant do stable releases yet
01:45:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: no 4a 5g releases
01:45:41 <TheJollyRoger> wowww!
01:45:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't have vendor support yet
01:45:53 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you strcat[m] and anupritaisno1[m]!
01:45:56 <eoo9> TheJollyRoger: no I don't have them muted I don't see then for websites in particular Google voice
01:46:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can't work on it without the device either
01:46:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry about that
01:46:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 5 only for now
01:47:01 <grapheneos_user_> <anupritaisno1[m] "Pixel 5 only for now "> Who cares, its great that you have pixel 5
01:47:14 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Oh no worries, that's still amazing to hear. Uh...
01:47:17 <grapheneos_user_> Especially given the circumstances
01:47:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm.
01:47:27 <TheJollyRoger> Give me a minute on this one.
01:50:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> grapheneos_user_pi: I don't have a pixel 5
02:13:29 <grapheneos_user_> <anupritaisno1[m] "grapheneos_user_pi: I don't have"> I Meant you have a pixel 5 OS
02:13:44 <grapheneos_user_> So you support it is what I meant
02:45:21 <adeus[m]> For some reason Vanadium is not working every website it says is down I tried creating new profile to see if it was a setting issue it does the same thing. I checked permission it has network access .
02:46:13 * adeus[m] uploaded an image: ima_05e50ac.jpeg (48KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BEjfrYnojFVPzpeMpGhcocYA/ima_05e50ac.jpeg >
02:46:18 <adeus[m]> This is every website
02:49:03 <blabtard[m]> <adeus[m] "For some reason Vanadium is not "> All good here, same site.
02:49:09 <strcat[m]> adeus: network is broken
02:49:17 <adeus[m]> This is every website though all other apps work
02:49:39 <strcat[m]> are you using a VPN?
02:49:45 <adeus[m]> The system just updated it self as well so that work
02:49:47 <adeus[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: no
02:50:26 <adeus[m]> Happens in a fresh user profile as well
02:51:26 <strcat[m]> sounds like a network issue
02:51:55 <adeus[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: nope. Bromite works.
02:52:09 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean it isn't onwe
02:52:12 <strcat[m]>  * doesn't mean it isn't one
02:53:18 <strcat[m]> you'll have to figure out what's wrong - can't do anything more with what you've provided
02:53:21 <strcat[m]> you said it's happening in a new profile so it's not something to do with the app data
02:53:32 <strcat[m]> I don't have any idea what you've done with the network, adb, etc.
02:53:53 <adeus[m]> @strcat:matrix.org:  not much honestly I just flashed this pixel 4a last night
02:53:57 <adeus[m]> Meh I’ll just reset it
02:54:16 <strcat[m]> you should figure out what's wrong
02:54:19 <strcat[m]> chances are you'll do the same thing
02:54:22 <strcat[m]> and end with the same problem
02:54:24 <strcat[m]> see that a lot
02:55:04 <adeus[m]> It’s a system setting because in admin i have no apps installed
02:55:38 <adeus[m]> I’ll figure it out
02:55:42 <strcat[m]> did you disable apps?
02:55:44 <sphinxcat[m]> the screenshot shows Orbot is open, maybe it's related to that
02:55:56 <adeus[m]> Orbot is not in vpn mode
02:56:11 <adeus[m]> And it happens in the admin profile which does not have any apps
02:57:16 <adeus[m]> I’ve obviously done something for life of me lol I can’t think what it might be I dig in to it for little while longer if anyone has ideas plz lmk
02:59:24 <strcat[m]> keep in mind there are 3 Vanadium apps: browser, library, WebView
02:59:32 <strcat[m]> make sure network access is permitted for the browser
03:00:52 <strcat[m]> maybe you did something with adb
03:00:58 <strcat[m]> don't have any idea what kinds of things you did
03:01:04 <strcat[m]> maybe you should just factory reset if you can't remember
03:08:35 <coppercrystalz[m> Hey y'all, I'm thinking I'm going to install Graphene OS on my Pixel 4a and using the aurora store for play store apps. Because of the lack of Google Play services from my understanding you don't get notifications from Play Store apps. How big of an issue have you all found this?
03:11:18 <blabtard[m]> Not an issue...but I made it my focus to find f-droid apps. I don't use things like Uber though.
03:12:25 <tidria[m]> uber does work in web view through Vanadium
03:16:53 <coppercrystalz[m> That's good to hear. I don't use many apps like Uber either, pretty much the only app where I find notification critical is Signal which has its own play service-less notifications. Another question I have is about gcam. I'd rather not have lower quality photos with Opencam, so I was thinking about taking the APK off of my stock phone and installing it again after flashing Graphene. From my understanding you can
03:16:53 <coppercrystalz[m> use gcam with microG from Fdroid even if you revoke all permissions that microG asks for. Is there a problem with this method for getting gcam to work?
03:17:20 <coppercrystalz[m> * That's good to hear. I don't use many apps like Uber either, pretty much the only app where I find notifications critical is Signal which has its own play service-less notifications. Another question I have is about gcam. I'd rather not have lower quality photos with Opencam, so I was thinking about taking the APK off of my stock phone and installing it again after flashing Graphene. From my understanding you
03:17:20 <coppercrystalz[m> can use gcam with microG from Fdroid even if you revoke all permissions that microG asks for. Is there a problem with this method for getting gcam to work?
03:18:27 <somenerd[m]> microg has no official support in GrapheneOS
03:18:28 <somenerd[m]> so it won't work
03:20:22 <blabtard[m]> OpenCam is best I've found. Not a photographer type though.
03:28:53 <zzxx1236> coppercrystalz[m you only need https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
03:29:25 <somenerd[m]> yeah, but Gcam may cease to stop working
03:30:35 <somenerd[m]> there was an issue to remove unnecessary SELinux policies

03:31:19 <somenerd[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1292405448381997056
03:35:30 <Jojo34> Having issues installing grapheneos. Any assistance would be appreciated. TYIA
03:36:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Jojo34, are you trying the Web installer or CLI method?
03:37:28 <Jojo34> Yes, web installer. (thanks!)
03:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. What step are you on?
03:37:48 <TheJollyRoger> I think I have some ideas already, but let's retrace your steps.
03:38:00 <TheJollyRoger> What operating system are you installing from, as well?
03:38:34 <Jojo34> Ok, using windows 10.
03:38:56 <Jojo34> Getting stuck on "Flash Release"
03:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, noted... you were able to unlock successfully though, correct?
03:39:58 <Jojo34> If completes quite a few precesses, restarts a few times and then gets stuck "error; undefined"
03:40:14 <Jojo34> Yes, unlock successfully
03:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> Alright -- typically at this stage what that signifies is one of two things: A) the cable isn't fully traced, or B) if the cable you're using is the OEM cable, support for USB on that port on your motherboard is incomplete or the vendor didn't implement all the features fully.
03:42:36 <strcat> Jojo34: which device
03:42:46 <Jojo34> Pixel 3a xl
03:43:01 <Jojo34> kicks me out in fastbootd
03:43:29 <Jojo34> *into fastbootd
03:44:46 <Jojo34> So TheJollyRoger, I may need to try this on another machine. Ive tried two cables already, neither OEM.
03:45:19 * TheJollyRoger frowns and scratches his chin.
03:45:27 <somenerd[m]> try the OEM?
03:45:55 <somenerd[m]> since TheJollyRoger said this "if the cable you're using is the OEM cable"
03:46:00 <somenerd[m]>  * since TheJollyRoger said this: "if the cable you're using is the OEM cable"
03:46:22 <Jojo34> Well the OEM cable is USB C to C. This computer doesn't have a C port. My other one does so I'll give it a go.
03:46:34 <TheJollyRoger> Jojo34: great. Fingers crossed!
03:54:19 <Jojo34> Very much appreciated. Now downloading release on the other machine. (with my rural connection I should be ready to try again in about 30-40 minutes haha)
03:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> Oh man aaaargh, I feel your pain! :(
03:55:28 <TheJollyRoger> Until recently, up north didn't have cable or broadband, we had to use old style DSL.
03:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> Slow and expensive! :(
03:57:00 <Thatcher[m]> Is there any indication to inform me as to whether an app I'm using (RedReader) is opening websites in its built-in web browser or vanadium web view?
03:57:08 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just going to get a snack, I'll be back shortly.
03:57:31 <rny> TheJollyRoger: what does that mean?
03:57:41 <rny> Thatcher[m]: what does that mean
03:58:16 <entry1[m]> If I may add a suggestion for the project since this is becoming a recurring theme; other than the OEM cable for flashing (which I have no experience of using personally as I don't have a USB C port) is there a USB A to USB C cable with the highest specs/success rate that can be endorsed or mentioned on the site? I know the project tries to stay as far away from strict recommendations in an attempt to give as much
03:58:16 <entry1[m]> choice for the user, but I think it could alleviate many of the cable issues.
03:59:17 <rny> how's the project supposedly meant to give such recommendations when different countries stock different vendor/brand usb-a to usb-c cables
03:59:42 <rny> what's being sold in north america may not necessarily be sold in australia and vice-versa
04:00:36 <Jojo34> makes sense. rny I was hoping my nice Amazon Basics USB 3.o A to C cable would work, but...
04:00:45 <entry1[m]> Possibly a small list of known ones that are affordable/effective that would span US/UK/Australia
04:01:01 <rny> our friends from india? the middle-east and etc?
04:01:09 <rny> it is just not feasible
04:01:16 <Jojo34> Good idea entry1[m]
04:01:53 <rny> Jojo34: not sure why the amazon basic cable wont work
04:01:58 <entry1[m]> <rny "it is just not feasible"> I'm sure it is feasible, but I agree that you mention a good point about accessibility among all counties.
04:02:35 <entry1[m]> <rny "Jojo34: not sure why the amazon "> Are they available in all countries? If so and it has a high success rate, then that could be a start
04:03:04 <rny> i know amazon is not available in every country.
04:07:15 <entry1[m]> <rny "i know amazon is not available i"> From brief research, there are 5 countries worldwide that Amazon isn't available in. Now as strcat has mentioned before, it is possible for certain brands to have counterfeits sold. In the event that Amazon Basics did work with a high success rate with almost no complaints and meets spec requirements, it would have a very low chance of being counterfeited on their site and it
04:07:15 <entry1[m]> could serve well as a recommendation.
04:07:53 <Thatcher[m]> <rny "Thatcher: what does that mean"> When I tell RedReader to 'use the internal browser' for opening links, does that mean it uses Vanadium web view?
04:08:15 <rny> Thatcher[m]: yes
04:14:16 <strcat[m]> amazon basics stuff is trash
04:14:30 <strcat[m]> I bought a displayport cable where it was not to spec and didn't implement the claimed version properly
04:14:39 <strcat[m]> couldn't do 4k @ 60Hz...
04:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ouch!
04:15:35 <utopia[m]> Amazon basics is ok with everything besides electronics
04:17:49 <TheJollyRoger> entry1[m]: I kind of like the Anker and Aukey cables, but they're kind of not that great value. Lot of money into gimmicks and fancy plugs and stuff.
04:18:58 <blabtard[m]> Apple cables have been flawless in my experience. inb4 appletard
04:19:19 <TheJollyRoger> blabtard[m]: well, Apple maintains their own standards, so they essentially also need to be the reference example for their own standards.
04:19:30 <JTL> I've heard good luck with Anker and Monoprice cables recently.
04:23:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:24:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. PirateCable brand cables when...
04:24:35 <dakotah[m]> amazon basics has stolen from smaller companies too
04:24:43 <entry1[m]> <strcat[m] "amazon basics stuff is trash"> See, I had no experience with them (other than non-electronic items) and that is a good point to note for others to be aware of. And TheJollyRoger  I've heard of those too with high regard, but I've personally never used them either due to their higher cost (which I'm sure is justifiable if they have more quality control and better quality). I know this is probably trivial
04:24:43 <entry1[m]> discussion, but does anyone else think it is worthwhile to see if there is a well built USB cable that is recommendable? I would recommend that this cable should not be used for daily charger use as wear can compromise the integrity and longevity of the cable.
04:24:45 <TheJollyRoger> "It functions as a USB-C cable, a garrotte, an emergency rappelling line, and will safely support 750 pounds without breaking!"
04:24:51 <TheJollyRoger> "Peter, we only needed it to be a data cable."
04:24:54 <TheJollyRoger> "Oh."
04:25:58 <TheJollyRoger> entry1[m]: Well, usually the cables that come with your phone are good enough for charging, installation, and transferring files.
04:26:30 <entry1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "entry1: Well, usually the cables"> I would agree, but I would wager that most users do not have a USB C port on their computer
04:26:50 <TheJollyRoger> entry1[m]: ohhhhh, oh point, good thinking.
04:28:12 <TheJollyRoger> So far I do like the Aukey and Anker cables because they are fully traced -- I ended up having to buy a couple because they have the wires needed to do UART-to-USB debugging. Most others don't.
04:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> (not even the Pixel cables)
04:28:45 <entry1[m]> I was just throwing that out there, that way anyone mentions something about a cable, we could simply recommend it and drop the discussion there as I'm sure we are all sick of discussing them or hearing about people's issues with them
04:28:46 <TheJollyRoger> But yeah, they're money.
04:29:00 <TheJollyRoger> Good thinking, you know what I'll go look up the one I bought.
04:30:30 <entry1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Good thinking, you know what I'l"> Sweet. The ones I bought are not brand name so I couldn't recommend them, but it would be cool to come to a common community consensus if it is readily available and works well (as well as being reasonable cost wise)
04:32:02 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
04:32:26 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying to see if I still have the box it came in, buried around here somewhere.
04:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, this one came out of a brick-and-mortar store, I didn't buy it online.
04:36:11 <entry1[m]> Lol no worries. I will also move this to offtopic. If you want to, I can purchase a few and try them in multiple computers as I have two phones to test them. If other people could possibly do the same thing, we could try and just be done with this discussion and just offer a suggestion for users who do not have a USB C port w/ the OEM cable.
04:39:15 <rny> i have never ordered any amazon basics stuff
04:39:19 <rny> cant comment on the quality
04:45:33 <rahoon_goaway[m]> I have it's USB-C to A cable, seems perfectly fine so far using it for internet tethering, file transfer, and once a webcam. Though I don't know how it would work for installation, since I used the cable that came with the phone for that
04:45:50 <rahoon_goaway[m]> *it's being amazon basics cable
04:50:29 <ddsmeyer[m]> First time on Matrix. Interested in GrOS as daily driver on pixel 4xl. How can I know what google play apps will be usuable. For example, QuickBooks is essential for business.
04:51:15 <ddsmeyer[m]> Obviously I won't be using Google Play
04:52:50 <rahoon_goaway[m]> Well there is the Aurora store.. that can install most google play apps, most of them will work i think
04:52:56 <utopia[m]> you cold probably use microg if QuickBooks fails to run properly
04:53:59 * blabtard[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210204-215215.png (187KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MPUKantSYhkQLcDbZIhhFzKQ/Screenshot_20210204-215215.png >
04:54:01 <blabtard[m]> Use Aurora from Fdroid and you'll be good. Just be aware of all the trackers...which is counterintuitive to GrapheneOS
04:54:10 * blabtard[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210204-215256.png (165KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fGBPpCxKBYzXIbJaJRzqpxOV/Screenshot_20210204-215256.png >
04:54:12 <ddsmeyer[m]> I want to be all in but need some confirmariins. Before dropping $400 on pixel4xl. How can I know these things for sure?
04:54:20 <ddsmeyer[m]> Hey that helps
04:55:04 <makingaliasesisa> Use Aurora Store for google store
04:55:25 <ddsmeyer[m]> You mean QuickBooks tracks you?
04:55:28 <makingaliasesisa>  * Use Aurora Store for google play
04:56:02 <blabtard[m]> <ddsmeyer[m] "You mean QuickBooks tracks you?"> https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/69005/
04:57:16 <take_a_deep_brea> blabtard: exodus uses a frequently updated but nevertheless static list of known  tracker classes to do its job
04:57:37 <somenerd[m]> it's useful to know if trackers are there
04:57:43 <somenerd[m]> but not if trackers aren
04:57:43 <take_a_deep_brea> its not a fool proof way to determine wether an app is violating your privacy or not
04:57:48 <somenerd[m]>  * but not if trackers aren't there
04:57:56 <ddsmeyer[m]> Cool site. Well that sucks. My business runs with QB.
04:58:32 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer: we all would love it if you had a more  seamless experience with the apps you used on your previous devices
04:58:43 <somenerd[m]> 1st party tracking would also be a problem
04:58:48 <take_a_deep_brea> but from what i can see QuickBooks may have play service dependencies
04:58:51 <somenerd[m]> which exodus may not pick up
04:59:55 <ddsmeyer[m]> Yes ... This is crushing my dreams of freedom.
04:59:59 <ddsmeyer[m]> Dang QB
05:00:14 <take_a_deep_brea> blabtard:  ddsmeyer  take a look at the app permissions over here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intuit.quickbooks&hl=en&gl=US
05:00:37 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer: there is nothing final about what i said
05:00:47 <makingaliasesisa> Some times an app won't need the play services though.
05:00:58 <take_a_deep_brea> recommend to try it out on graphene
05:01:18 <take_a_deep_brea> if your workflow does not get disrupted by this
05:01:36 <ddsmeyer[m]> I wonder if I can run it in browser mode
05:02:09 <blabtard[m]> You can try that from where you are now.
05:02:14 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer:  if you still wish to adopt a more secure device for work . a recent iOS device is not bad . also it has good privacy practices when it comes to third parties
05:02:27 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer: thats a good option too .
05:02:39 <take_a_deep_brea> i mean browser
05:03:40 <somenerd[m]> you can just try it and see if it works first
05:03:54 <somenerd[m]> baseline compatibility doesn't need Google Play Services
05:04:09 <strcat[m]> you're in control of the data you give to applications, I really wonder what people think it means when they're talking about apps having 'trackers'
05:04:26 <somenerd[m]> I mean, I was personally confused for a long time
05:04:29 <somenerd[m]> still am ngl
05:04:42 <somenerd[m]> they're sandboxed
05:04:51 <somenerd[m]> soooooo idk what exactly they can track
05:05:04 <strcat[m]> lots of apps have telemetry whether or not they use 3rd party libraries
05:05:05 <somenerd[m]> except for some permissionless problems (like Packages)
05:05:36 <strcat[m]> in Auditor we have 'Submit sample data' which is basically opt-in telemetry: you choose to send a sample attestation and the system properties, runtime properties, etc.
05:05:44 <strcat[m]> it's not like there's anything sensitive in that
05:05:45 <ddsmeyer[m]> Looks like QB works in browser on android
05:05:54 <ddsmeyer[m]> Yay
05:05:59 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
05:06:43 <ddsmeyer[m]> Okay, I will take the plunge and fiddle with it for the next few months.
05:06:54 <ddsmeyer[m]> I have no hacker skills
05:07:05 <somenerd[m]> you don't need hacker skills
05:07:13 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer: just make sure all the QB features work for you on your browser
05:07:16 <ddsmeyer[m]> Is there a YouTube tutorial or something for flashing GrOS?
05:07:19 <somenerd[m]> it's meant to be a normal phone
05:07:23 <somenerd[m]> > Is there a YouTube tutorial or something for flashing GrOS?
05:07:23 <somenerd[m]> no
05:07:29 <somenerd[m]> most ones on YT are misleading
05:07:30 <ddsmeyer[m]> Good to know
05:07:36 <somenerd[m]> and have lead to bricking people's phones
05:07:42 <somenerd[m]> <ddsmeyer[m] "Good to know"> there's a web install
05:07:43 <ddsmeyer[m]> Eeeekkk
05:07:46 <somenerd[m]> you can use that
05:07:53 <ddsmeyer[m]> Can u all recommend?
05:08:01 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
05:08:17 <somenerd[m]> here's the web installer
05:08:18 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer:  graphene is a regular mobile OS which focuses on security and privacy . no frills . its meant to be usable out of the box .
05:08:26 <ddsmeyer[m]> I have seen this. Honestly it looks beyond me.
05:08:38 <makingaliasesisa> I personally would do the manual one but it is a cool idea to try the web installer.
05:08:45 <take_a_deep_brea> if something does not work for you , you are welcome to ask here
05:08:59 <strcat[m]> the web installer is our recommendation unless you are experienced with the CLI and on an OS where you actually have working fastboot/signify packages
05:09:14 <ddsmeyer[m]> Is this 24/7 support?
05:09:23 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer: it is recommended to use the web installer
05:09:47 <take_a_deep_brea> ddsmeyer: kinda . this is a regular matrix room / irc channel
05:10:11 <ddsmeyer[m]> What does irc stand for?
05:10:12 <take_a_deep_brea> no guarantees that someone will be there 24/7 but i guess someone is
05:10:24 <somenerd[m]> Internet Relay Chat
05:11:01 <ddsmeyer[m]> Does GrOS run better on unlocked pixel 4 vs 4xl?
05:11:15 <strcat[m]> IRC runs on internet time
05:11:27 <ddsmeyer[m]> What phone provider is secure?
05:11:32 <strcat[m]> when you show up at the channel it's the morning and when you're leaving it's night time
05:11:43 <ddsmeyer[m]> Lol
05:11:47 <take_a_deep_brea> lmoa
05:11:54 <makingaliasesisa> lol
05:11:56 <somenerd[m]> lol
05:11:59 <somenerd[m]> > I personally would do the manual one but it is a cool idea to try the web installer.
05:11:59 <somenerd[m]> I mean, it's only better if you know what you're doing
05:12:05 <somenerd[m]> and have the packages
05:12:19 <rny> ddsmeyer[m]: the helpdesk is closed.
05:12:20 <ddsmeyer[m]> I have noooooothing
05:12:30 <somenerd[m]> if you don't have the signify package and don't know how to use the command line, then use the web installer
05:12:35 <makingaliasesisa> yeah true. I'm adept at cli enough
05:12:44 <TheJollyRoger> ddsmeyer[m]: No phone provider is secure. The publicly switched telephone network is by design security-agnostic, so security is the task of your service provider's transport layer security, or your app's end-to-end encryption.
05:12:47 <strcat[m]> i.e. if you can do `pacman -Syu android-tools android-udev signify`, download the release, extract, verify with signify after getting pub key and checking multiple sources and you understand the instructions
05:12:59 <strcat[m]> then you have the advantage of verifying with our offline signing key
05:13:04 <strcat[m]> otherwise just use the web installer
05:13:13 <ddsmeyer[m]> Is there a data onlynprovider? I use signal now
05:13:54 <TheJollyRoger> ddsmeyer[m]: that largely varies. Some carriers do indeed offer data-only, some don't, some offer it only prepaid, some require a plan. It's very wild-west, you'll need to shop around.
05:14:19 <Jojo34> Thanks TheJollyRoger, New cable, new machine worked! OS booting now.
05:14:28 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
05:14:50 <TheJollyRoger> Jojo34: Woohoo! Glad to hear it worked, don't forget to relock the bootloader and once you get through the launcher, you'll likely want to switch OEM unlocking back off.
05:15:42 <makingaliasesisa> What i have a problem with my phone it has dead zones in the worst of places lol
05:15:43 <makingaliasesisa> and it is new.
05:15:43 <ddsmeyer[m]> What sim providers do you all use? I can start there.
05:15:46 <TheJollyRoger> ddsmeyer[m]: with respect to the 4 vs 4XL, those two phones if I recall correctly use the same chip, just the 4XL has a bigger screen and a slightly larger battery.
05:15:58 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
05:16:10 <ddsmeyer[m]> Thx
05:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Some people will like the extra real estate on the screen.
05:16:44 <Jojo34> TheJollyRoger you got it.
05:16:51 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
05:17:08 <strcat[m]> 4a is what we recommend for most ppl atm
05:17:16 <take_a_deep_brea> <ddsmeyer[m] "What sim providers do you all us"> ddsmeyer: it really depends on where you live . though if you ask questions based on your local provider you may get better responses
05:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's the "best value phone".
05:17:26 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
05:17:30 <ddsmeyer[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I don't want 5g
05:17:39 <ddsmeyer[m]> 😵
05:17:45 <strcat[m]> ddsmeyer: 4a doesn't have 5G
05:17:49 <strcat[m]> 4a 5G is a different device
05:18:04 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a does not have 5G. The 4a5G does, but it's a very different device, the chip, SoC, and everything underneath that glossy black plastic shell is different.
05:18:06 <somenerd[m]> the normal 4a?
05:18:14 <TheJollyRoger> For some reason Google decided to give it a very confusing name.
05:18:19 <strcat[m]> 4a 5G is a totally different phone
05:18:46 <TheJollyRoger> the only thing similar about the 4a5G to the 4a is the plastic case it comes in.
05:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> And the name.
05:19:44 <makingaliasesisa> very true
05:20:08 <somenerd[m]> lol yeah why did they name it that way?
05:20:14 <somenerd[m]> extremely confusing
05:20:30 <TheJollyRoger> Jojo34: Hope GrapheneOS works out for you, welcome aboard the ship! If you like the software or want to support GrapheneOS' efforts to continue the project, please chuck the devs a donation at https://grapheneos.org/donate , this ship's funded by and kept sailing by donations alone, so it really helps.
05:20:59 <TheJollyRoger> I... I have no idea. I think they were planning to make a separate device further down the line following the release of the 5 but then couldn't wait to just fart out a second one.
05:21:14 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
05:22:33 <TheJollyRoger> We're coming up to 6, so I really hope they don't start counting in George Lucas numbers.
05:22:38 <TheJollyRoger> Or we're going to end up being in trouble!
05:22:43 <TheJollyRoger> Or worse, in Xbox numbers!
05:23:03 <TheJollyRoger> Introducing, the "Pixel"! Now it's the  "Pixel 360"! now it's the "Pixel One!"
05:23:15 <TheJollyRoger> Everyone else: "Uwaah...?"
05:24:00 <somenerd[m]> 4.5a would've made sense
05:24:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:26:05 <ddsmeyer[m]> Is there a matrix group just on privacy degoogle questions?

05:28:30 <makingaliasesisa> cool thanks
05:28:47 <grapheneos_user_> Welcome
05:30:41 <cani> i wantto say thank you for the people working on the project
05:31:14 <cani> i'm teasing my friends on Samsung on how fast i just got the new update
05:32:00 <makingaliasesisa> yeah it can be insanely fast to get updates on GOS
06:44:41 <rz> hi, I'm stuck with a Pixel 3 that won't connect to usb.. have anyone been able to install it paired using wifi (wireless debugging pairing..) ?
06:45:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hello rz, I think you're going to be on your own for that, sorry. I've never tried WiFi debugging.
06:45:45 <TheJollyRoger> Installation of GrapheneOS requires the use of Fastboot.
06:46:04 <TheJollyRoger> Since it must talk to the bootloader and rekey the bootloader.
06:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> I had a Pixel 3 as well previously. The Pixel 3's USB slot is notoriously finicky, mine actually got waterdamaged. I had to take it in to get the USB slot replaced.
06:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> I figure what likely happened to mine was that water got in and damaged the USB chip or caused the pins to become rusted and stop working.
06:49:49 <rz> ok i've already ordered the usb slot, but 1week delay for the delivery, think I'll have to wait then.. did you ever had some issues with the power button? (the phone shutdown but 10sec later reboot by itself ) ?
06:50:14 <TheJollyRoger> I didn't have any issues with the power button.
06:50:27 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck on the repair, you're a braver soul than I am.
06:50:36 <rz> I just bought mine like 10h ago and just came to the conclusion that I've been screwed :(
06:51:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, yikes! :( Sorry to hear that man, that really sucks.
06:51:48 <rz> Its not bravery my friend, my wife's gonna "kill me" if I don't fix my mistake haha!!
06:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> Oh no aaaargh!!!!
06:52:18 <rz> thanks for your help, I'll wait for the parts to come in.
09:00:03 <Preload[m]> From what I know, Graphene OS disables dynamic code execution. So, will apps like Termux work on it?

10:53:43 <axlrose> Guys, what u think about grapheneos gsi? I mean on xiaomeme device, ik it still will lack of hardware and kernel(although 4.19 was ported to my device) security but it'll get userspace hardening like hardened malloc. Is it better than using device based lineageos?
10:56:16 <somenerd[m]> there's no official support
10:58:41 <axlrose> Ik that, but just ur thoughts on this compromise
10:58:58 <somenerd[m]> I mean, you'd have to build it
10:59:03 <somenerd[m]> for the device
10:59:13 <somenerd[m]> and it'd have to support verified boot to be decent
10:59:21 <axlrose> Oh, ofc

14:47:10 <fabs> hi people..i used the official doc (https://grapheneos.org/install/cli) to install graphene on pixel 4a. everything worked fine after locking the bootloader again. if i want to boot the os, it get stucked in fastboot mode with the information "no valid slot to boot". before flashing i already installed the latest ota for google android. and i
14:47:10 <fabs> already tried to find an answer by searching in the internet, but i didn't find anything. hopefully someone can support me with this issue =)
14:49:19 <fabs> after flashing, I also got the information to visit this site g.co/ABH and the google screen was shown as well..
14:55:36 <Core8452> why do not apps install when using Aurora store?
14:59:06 <utopia[m]> What happens when you try to install
15:02:47 <fabs> ok, after another flash it works! the reason was, that i didn't unplug the device after pressing "Start" in bootloader..
15:04:11 <Core8452> well nothing ?
15:04:31 <Core8452> as if nothing happened
15:06:13 <utopia[m]> So you hit the install button and it doesn't respond?

19:25:50 <Great_Mitakes> Hey awesome people of this time in human history. I have another question, although this is probably not grapheneos specific.
19:30:04 <Core8452> I'm actually genuinely impressed with this pixel 4a. She's a keeper, folks.
19:30:22 <Great_Mitakes> When I first installed grapheneos, I was delighted to notice that videos continued to play even when I went to look at other things. I just noticed that isn't happening anymore. Now they pause when I'm not looking at them. Is this perhaps a setting I didn't notice I disabled, or did the new update do this?
19:32:30 <Core8452> does it charge 18 watts without the charger too tho? seems to fill up pretty fast even just connected to laptop via USB c
19:33:31 <Great_Mitakes> Core8452 Yeah, it's not too bad, but really unlocked is the way to go unless somebody's giving it you a hand me down for free.
19:35:59 <Great_Mitakes> Core8452 I apologize for my ignorance, but What do you mean by 18 watts?
19:37:00 <nscnt[m]> Great_Mitakes: Are you talking about Vanadium?
19:37:11 <Core8452> the included charger is rated at 18 watts, was just wondering what the wattage is through USB c alone, no charger
19:41:15 <Great_Mitakes> Core8452 Oh that depends entirely on whether the USB port provides that amount of power. I don't know what the specs are, but if course 3.0 & 3.1 ports are designed for higher power output, greater bandwidth, and quicker charging.
19:44:03 <Hodge88> USB2 and USB3 are capable of ~5 watts
19:44:38 <Great_Mitakes> nscnt[m] No, I was using a different browser. I forgot to check if vanadium works now since the update. Thanks. I'll go see if it's just the browser.
19:44:53 <nscnt[m]> Great_Mitakes: Vanadium can play media in the background. It depends on the website. For example, YouTube does not allow background playback (when used with the browser).
19:47:12 <nscnt[m]> It pauses when you switch off from Vanadium if I remember correctly, but you can press play again.
19:48:47 <nscnt[m]> The Media player will be in the Quick Settings where you can pause/play the media.
19:49:38 <Great_Mitakes> nscnt[m] Thanks, duhhh, I'm such a moron dude. Yeah, it was the browser. Brave browser allows playback when I'm doing other stuff.
19:50:50 <plowdownfarmon> ok.  graphene is great and just donated only after 1 day.  who can recommend the best passsword manager from the f-droid site?  preffereably one that runs a extension on browser also.  thanks.
19:51:14 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic / #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
19:52:36 <plowdownfarmon>  i will take that as a hint to post somewhere else.  thanks.
19:53:07 <nscnt[m]> Yes, we have a few rules that are worth reading: https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
19:53:28 <nscnt[m]> The link is in the channel description.
19:53:44 <Great_Mitakes> nscnt[m], Brave browser also allows youtube to play when doing other stuff, but it did not allow two videos to play at the same time.
19:53:50 <mhnoyes> Is there a list of apps that are known to work published somewhere?
19:54:10 <plowdownfarmon> (y)
19:54:49 <Great_Mitakes> plowdownfarmon I think this is the grapheneos specific help/tech support chat.
19:56:15 <plowdownfarmon> Great_Mitakes understood.  thanks.  appreciated.

21:12:23 <mintsauce[m]>  * the way I see it is this room is for genuine bug discussion and developer stuff only really, all the rest is better off over in the Graphene off topic, whre you will also get devs helping out plenty
21:28:13 <Hodge88> The grapheneOS installation instruction page points here for assistance with installation issuues
21:28:53 <Hodge88> Which will mostly be noobs that don't know what they're doing...
21:28:58 <Hodge88> Like me
21:30:30 <rny> what issue do you have with installation?
21:30:42 <rny> i can help newbies.
21:30:50 <mintsauce[m]> fair enough, but in my experience you'll likely get faster help in the other room so maybe try both in event of installation problems, there are a lot of knowledgeable users in the other one, here too of course but the other one's busier
21:30:50 <rny> on a good day.
21:36:09 <WoC80> Any plans to add clarifications about root access to the faq ?
21:36:49 <WoC80> I would imagine I might not be the first to ask
21:37:36 <rny> WoC80: nobody should have root access on graphene os
21:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> WoC80: I actually had a draft for that, but if you'd like the lowdown, root access is mutually exclusive with GrapheneOS.
21:37:56 <TheJollyRoger> If you'd like, I can resubmit that draft.
21:38:12 <WoC80> Please do
21:38:14 <TheJollyRoger> But that could take a while so I could simply tell you: rooting won't be supported, ever.
21:38:25 <rny> in fact, there's just no superuser mode on mobile OSes
21:38:43 <rny> for the user
21:39:33 <mintsauce[m]> evenin/murrnen Cap'n
21:39:33 <TheJollyRoger> The android security model was designed with one assumption in mind: nothing, except maybe the kernel and vold will have root equivalent access; even init does not have unconstrained access. Everything is otherwise constrained to the least amount of privilege it needs, only to do its job.
21:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy mintsauce[m]!
21:39:58 <WoC80> Thanks for the clarification, just investigating currently available options for my pixel 4 xl, before I discard it
21:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> Rooting destroys that and essentially destroys the entire android security model, and is mutually exclusive with verified boot and OTA updates.
21:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> without verified boot, any security measures that also depend on it, such as Remote Attestation for self-monitoring of device integrity, hardware-backed keying, all that also end up crippled.
21:41:28 <rny> discard?
21:41:37 <blk> lol I was going to ask
21:41:48 <blk> My Pixel 3 is offended...
21:41:57 <WoC80> I presume there are no native development tools for grapheneos ?
21:42:08 <rny> the aosp tools
21:42:16 <WoC80> So, no
21:42:35 <TheJollyRoger> WoC80: there are development tools for GrapheneOS; we use the AOSP and depot tools as well as the Android SDK. There's no sense in reinventing the wheel.
21:42:58 <WoC80> Keyword native
21:43:07 <rny> i just dont understand the question
21:43:36 <WoC80> Afaik, there are no tools for arm64/aarch64
21:43:53 <rny> ahhh
21:44:03 <rny> WoC80: no, there arent any
21:44:37 <rny> you meant to ask "are there any development tools that run natively on grapheneos?"
21:44:57 <WoC80> Sorry, I thought I did
21:44:59 <blk> or he wants to build grapheneos on an aarch64 host?
21:45:07 <rny> semantically very different
21:45:10 <rny> lulz
21:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, very small change in wording, very big change in difference.
21:45:31 <TheJollyRoger> *change in meaning.
21:45:40 <WoC80> True
21:45:59 <rny> WoC80: besides a functional shell in userdebug mode, dont think there's much
21:46:07 <WoC80> Or using distcc
21:46:20 <rny> you can install aarch64 built stuff and install it in userdebug mode to use within the shell, if you must
21:46:39 <rny> but none will run appropriately within the permission model set in grapheneos
21:55:40 <Hodge88> mintsauce[m] Perhaps the installation page should point towards the chatroom that is most appropriate for newbies having difficulty installing. A newbie myself, even this IRC chat system is unfamiliar and a bit overwhelming

22:54:09 <fred`> ah - since its no 'issue' i thought its wrong there - thx blk
23:20:52 <blk> fred`: the word "issue" does not have a negative conotation in the software sense
23:22:08 <blk> issues are just topics for discussion :-)
23:24:33 <fred`> i also thought about why i'm so negative about that word :)
23:24:45 <fred`> 'conditioning'
23:34:37 <blk> I think it's fairly common in coloquial English for "issue" to be used as a synonym for "problem"
23:36:50 <blk> I think because it's a widely used euphemism
