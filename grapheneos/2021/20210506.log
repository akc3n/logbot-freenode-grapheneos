00:25:42 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * As stringcat said, copperhead has halted the attacks
00:26:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It may just be temporary, but we shouldn't talk about it
00:26:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I only posted the link because the other person asked
00:32:55 <frontman[m]> I can't get scrcpy working on my pixel 3xl. Is this a security feature?
00:35:49 <strcat[m]> no
00:37:42 <frontman[m]> Ok
00:51:37 <bizanon[m]> repo isnt available for ubuntu 20.04.
00:51:37 <bizanon[m]> how can i install it?
00:51:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which repo?
00:52:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hello bizanon
00:52:17 <bizanon[m]> repo package for building
00:52:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, I'm not knowledgeable enough on this topic, sorry
00:53:46 <bizanon[m]> is this okay to follow ? https://source.android.com/setup/develop#installing-repo
00:59:35 <Pratyush[m]> bizanon:  yes
01:03:03 <LinusSexTips[m]1> >integrate modern Android theme and wallpaper configuration
01:03:04 <LinusSexTips[m]1> this is good
01:03:06 <LinusSexTips[m]1> thank you
01:03:27 <LinusSexTips[m]1> not a fan of the default qs icons
01:03:50 <bizanon[m]> Pratyush: does the repo executable need to be in grapheneos-11 directory?
01:07:19 <bizanon[m]> nvm i got it
01:09:07 <bizanon[m]> what about git-config? do i have to use my real name and email?
01:09:44 <Pratyush[m]> bizanon: yes it need executable permission, also all these info is provided in gos build section or aosp build section.
01:41:21 <hasnoname[m]> Are we deleting chats or there hasn't been no activity or something wrong my end?
01:42:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Privateer Monkey> No activity here, either, in ~30mins
01:43:06 <TheJollyRoger> hasnoname[m]: you can see what logbot sees at the public channel log, at https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos - activity here tends to be fairly sporadic. Occasionally, there are lulls, and then bits of activity.
01:43:58 <hasnoname[m]> I see my message from few days ago obscuring the chat

01:44:48 <TheJollyRoger> hasnoname[m]: occasionally, Matrix can deliver messages out of order. It happens from time to time if the matrix bridge dies, is queued, lags out, or is dropped altogether. From time to time if the bridge craps out, then this can also happen.

02:49:42 <Cliff[m]> Is there a setting for dark keyboard theme? Can't find it.
02:51:27 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: hold down the , key until you see a gear pop up. Tap that gear. See "appearances & layouts"
02:51:48 <TheJollyRoger> From there, select "theme." GrapheneOS comes with four.
02:51:50 <bizanon[m]> what should I change the update server url to?
02:52:16 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: If you do not have an update server of your own, set it to 127.0.0.1 so it polls itself.
02:52:29 <bizanon[m]> ok ty
02:52:39 <guccigang06> bonjour tout le monde
02:53:06 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy guccigang06, unfortunately this is an English only channel, I don't think many of us speak French at this moment.
02:53:18 <guccigang06> excuse moi jai un grapheneos et jai un souci avec des aplication google il se plante au demarrage
02:53:31 <guccigang06> je utulise le traducteur
02:54:11 <TheJollyRoger> My French is pretty broken, but, "Anglais seulement"
02:54:33 <TheJollyRoger> Je m'excuse, Anglais seulemont.
02:54:36 <TheJollyRoger> *seulement.
02:56:27 <guccigang06> excuse I have a grapheneos on a google pixel 4a 5g and since the last update of grapheneos I have a google application it crashes when starting the application I do not know how to do it
02:56:50 <Cliff[m]> Can changing the languages of the keyboard make me more identifiable?
02:58:00 <TheJollyRoger> guccigang06: It is likely that the application is dependent on Google. This is a problem with the application itself.
02:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: No.
02:59:05 <guccigang06> I looked on the internet he said to remove the notification but at the beginning it works very well the application
03:00:10 <TheJollyRoger> I am sorry, I do not know how to help you with this app. I can write down that it no longer works on GrapheneOS, if you can tell me what it is.
03:00:45 <guccigang06> ces l application silent phone
03:01:02 <Cliff[m]> TheJollyRoger thanks
03:01:23 <TheJollyRoger> I will write that one down, thank you. I am sorry I can not help you with it. :(
03:01:52 <guccigang06> TheJollyRoger it is a communication application
03:01:59 <guccigang06> merci beaucoup
03:02:42 <TheJollyRoger> The app was published by Silent Circle?
03:04:13 <guccigang06> oui
03:04:24 <TheJollyRoger> merci!

03:32:00 <Dylanger[m]> <grouxy "I get following error when I try"> I'm getting the same error for Android Auto
03:32:09 <Dylanger[m]> Does anyone know why this occurring?
03:32:39 <Dylanger[m]> Looks like it could be related to malloc? The error looks like it's denying mapping a segment of memory in
03:40:35 <guccigang06> I don't really know but since the last update a lot of bugs on aplication
04:14:52 <msgraph0909[m]> Recently got graphene on an unlocked Pixel3.  But I realized though that there were some features of the original Pixel3 camera that were useful. Any chance I can get the Pixel3 camera app apk somewhere?
04:25:28 <strcat[m]> it's possible
04:25:35 <strcat[m]> you also need another app to pretend to be stuff it needs
05:25:31 <M7-x230[m]> What's the major differences between graphene and calyx?
05:26:03 <louipc> graphenos is security focused and hardened. calyx is not
05:26:53 <louipc> read more at https://grapheneos.org/faq and https://grapheneos.org/articles/
06:19:30 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
07:58:48 <noctux> msgraph0909[m]: one option would be to extract the apk from the ota image https://developers.google.com/android/ota but you also need https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider to pretend that play services are installed (at least that is how I do it on a pixel 4a. My notes on this: https://paste.xinu.at/QM5eiS/ But I believe more detailed discussion would be off topic in this
07:58:49 <noctux> channel, as it concerns thirdparty-softwarestuff)
08:16:49 <ramenweekend[m]> Does anyone have a nice list of FOSS app replacements Google-free?
08:17:50 <whiskey0111[m]> Did you already read the recommendations on privacytools.io?
08:18:07 <ramenweekend[m]> Not yet, but I'll read it now.
09:17:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> privacytools.io is not counted as a good information resource in security focused groups, afaik
09:24:02 <whiskey0111[m]> but they do have a good enough FOSS app list
09:25:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in that case, your definition of "good enough" does not meet the minimal security requirements
09:25:44 <whiskey0111[m]> Why?
09:25:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I suggest you to read and learn more on the subject of information security
09:26:16 <whiskey0111[m]> yes but why arent they a good source ?
09:27:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Because they give recommendations that value privacy in the first place, without considering the security aspect almost at all
09:27:55 <EV-9600[m]> <whiskey0111[m] "yes but why arent they a good so"> Because their view point is different then that of the Graphene people so they must be wrong
09:28:16 <whiskey0111[m]> ok
09:29:31 <whiskey0111[m]> But the apps they list are good for replacing google play apps
09:29:48 <whiskey0111[m]> that is what was asked
09:29:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> EV-9600[m]: the way you worded it is not preferable
09:31:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> again, whiskey, your definition of "good" is, at the very least, subjective
09:31:30 <EV-9600[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> privacytools.io is not c"> This is also not worded preferably
09:32:23 <EV-9600[m]> Also, any time a privacy focused group is brought up here the community here will shit on it
09:32:36 <EV-9600[m]> Which is also not preferable
09:34:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> anyway, app discussions are off-topic
10:04:17 <ramenweekend[m]> How is it off-topic? Isn't it related to adoption of the OS to have Google-free replacements? Without knowing about a viable alternative, people's hindrance to leave the empire is warranted.
10:04:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read the rules please
10:09:10 <ramenweekend[m]> Then how do I join/switch to #grapheneos-offtopic? I have no idea how to use this platform.
10:09:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can search for public rooms on matrix afaik
10:10:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and if you search for GrapheneOS you will get 2 results

17:02:13 <faxing[m]> I have

17:04:00 <faxing[m]> Not shown from lsblk
17:04:07 <faxing[m]> You mean adb/fastboot?
17:04:32 <xd4e[m]> hello, how do you flash a development build ? I first flashed a signed release, everything was working fine and now I just did 'fastboot flash system system.img' to flash the new image but the phone now says its corrupted and wont boot

17:12:49 <helloworldkk87[m> Have you looked on githubs issue tracker if others are having same problem
17:13:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> Did you update the Linux kernel and forget to reboot
17:36:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> It’s hard for us in the EU (European Union).I deleted WhatsApp for like 4 weeks but had to redownload the app. So many of my kids activities revolves around the Use of WhatsApp. The teachers and members of staff all put things in WhatsApp.Then there is our company. People in the USA don’t understand. It’s very difficult to get off WhatsApp.Is there an app or something that can mitigate the meta data that we send?
17:37:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> Does graphene have any way to protect meta data from big brother apps???
17:39:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Gabe> Use a secondary profile and limit the permissions the application can access
17:40:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> Gabe thanks. Is it possible to do on graphene os, or do I need to download a third party app?
17:42:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Gabe> This is all part of the OS

19:15:36 <panoramics[m]> https://lemmy.ml/post/62816
19:16:03 <panoramics[m]> I wonder, on my pixel 5, sensors are granted permission to every app per default. Does this include the accelerometer?
19:16:03 <panoramics[m]> Is this needed by any app really?
19:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> panoramics[m]: The reason Network and Sensors are enabled by default is because apps need to be specifically written for GrapheneOS in order to request or not to request them. Those permissions are nonstandard and specific to GrapheneOS, meaning we're breaking away from the Android compatibility specification to implement them.
19:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> As a result, apps that aren't specifically written for GrapheneOS don't know to or not to request them, and as a result they have to be there and granted by default to avoid breaking apps that users will otherwise expect to work.
19:20:50 <TheJollyRoger> At a future date, an open task for GrapheneOS is to go through the list of system apps and enumerate which ones legitimately require or don't require the network and sensors and include that into their manifest. Help would be greatly appreciated on this issue.
19:22:18 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. I've gone through my permissions and fiddled with  everything. All is running fine.
19:22:32 <TheJollyRoger> You can deny sensors permission to apps you've installed all you want, but until this is completed, deny sensors or network permission to system apps at your own peril: you may not know what functionality you may be breaking.
19:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, some apps have a legitimate need to know when the phone is pressed up against your ear so it can reduce volume, or allow the phone to wake up when tilted or moved, etc. We don't suggest you fiddle with permissions with system apps, even though anecdotally others have done it and been alright.
19:24:38 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, you're fine to fiddle with them for third-party apps that GrapheneOS doesn't come with.
19:25:08 <GhostSplinterSix> None of my apps have Sensor enabled and some have Network enabled and they all are running perfectly fine.
19:25:16 <TheJollyRoger> GhostSplinterSix: again, see above please.
19:25:48 <GhostSplinterSix> Yup. I saw.
19:26:32 <GhostSplinterSix> I was just chiming in and letting others know what the results of my tweaking app permissions were.
19:28:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I just don't recommend fiddling with system apps; the worst thing you can do on GrapheneOS is attempt to be a "power user." If there's something specific that should be changed, ideally, it should be changed at GrapheneOS' side, not on the users'. Work is ongoing on this, and I understand it's slow, but we definitely don't want to get users in the habit of trying to fiddle with system
19:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> settings.
19:28:47 <GhostSplinterSix> Oh. Of course. That's completely understandable.
19:29:01 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks!
19:29:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> I don't think editing permissions with the built in settings is a problem at all personally.
19:29:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> I also disable such features that aren't needed on system apps
19:29:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> TheJollyRoger: I went into developer options and now I have a big 60 on my screen, plus now I have perpendicular lines showing where I am tapping. What happened?
19:30:12 <Railgun_Lover[m]> (I don't but this is what happens)
19:30:51 <Cliff[m]> Is there a way to turn on the max headphone volume? So it switches to a safe max volume when i enter a headphone, i dont know if it is a AOSP feature.
19:31:09 <TheJollyRoger> @potat_o - again, I don't think that's the greatest idea, for the reasons outlined above. If you want to do that to your own phone, I won't try to stop you, but I really don't think it should be encouraged, when GrapheneOS wants to take user judgement (and remove user mistakes) from the security equation.
19:31:47 <TheJollyRoger> Railgun_Lover[m]: I don't know what you did, I think you may have turned on "show feedback" or something of the sort.
19:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: Hold the slider and turn it up.
19:32:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> TheJollyRoger: no me saying that was to parody what happens
19:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> Railgun_Lover[m]: Haha, oh.
19:32:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> Again, I think it's fine.
19:33:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> @potat_o you may think it's fine, but that's wrong
19:33:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> Or I'm right and not wrong
19:33:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Unless you know exactly what you are doing, don't mess with developer options
19:33:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Or even sensor stuff
19:34:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> Changing app permissions isn't even a developer option, it's a build in feature
19:34:26 <TheJollyRoger> @potat_o - I discourage it, for the reasons above. As I said earlier, if you want to see these permissions not show up, we need help with enumerating which apps legitimately do or don't require it, and then adding it to their manifest. The changes should be made developer-side, the users shouldn't be saddled with this choice.
19:34:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> @potat_o I said, even sensor stuff
19:34:44 <Cliff[m]> TheJollyRoger I know how to change the volume. What i meant was, i used my earbuds this morning wich i always have to use with a higher volume. I just plugged in my headphones and my ears are still ringing XD
19:34:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> For system apps, I mean
19:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> Again, there's a backlog and stuff gets done when manpower is available to.
19:35:07 <TheJollyRoger> *manpower is available to do it.
19:35:16 <skwisgaar[m]> For what it’s worth, countless people in here have caused major issues with their devices by tinkering with system apps. If you’re gonna do it, just keep a good track of what you’re doing so you can undo it later if needed.
19:35:24 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If you're going to change stuff, and refuse to take our advice of not changing it, don't come here when it breaks...
19:35:34 <TheJollyRoger> This, exactly.
19:36:08 <Cliff[m]> Is there like a safe max volume i can set up so that when plugging in a 3.5 mm Jack it doesnt exceed a max safe volume like i had on old android devices
19:36:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It would be fun if you could do automation stuff with GrapheneOS without developer options, but I get that it isn't a privacy or security feature
19:36:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> Like what
19:37:42 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: Automation like ansible or salt?
19:38:13 <dnull> Or like openqa?
19:38:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> dnull: just general stuff
19:38:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Making scripts to automate stuff
19:38:55 <dnull> Stuff being what? Compiling? Testing?
19:44:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <dnull "Stuff being what? Compiling? Tes"> General stuff for automation
19:44:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not really important tho
19:46:46 <M0s_and_1s[m]> If you are familiar with iOS think “shortcuts”. Its a framework for basic scripting capabilities
19:47:19 <M0s_and_1s[m]> Cool. But outside of the scope of Graphene
19:47:34 <M0s_and_1s[m]> * Cool, but outside of the scope of Graphene
20:07:38 <panoramics[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Once again, you're fine to fiddl"> Nice though that Graphene allows for this as well. But i assume Sensors mean also accelerometer right? Just to confirm...
20:08:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yes, that is correct
20:10:46 <panoramics[m]> Awesome. Feels amazing to have control over such things. Thats the beauty of this OS. Very Grateful for everyones work and to have this capabilities 🙏
20:27:49 <Baba[m]> Can I avoide my 2ndry profile from share media storage. I dnt want that my 2ndry profile view media which i stored in owner profile.
20:47:41 <veehem[m]> Pixel 4
20:52:33 <dnull> Railgun_Lover[m]: Ok. Good luck.
21:05:28 <Pratyush[m]> <Baba[m] "Can I avoide my 2ndry profile fr"> yes. by default it does not have access to owner profiles data including media afaik
21:09:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Is there a way to see what's been updated each time a system update occurs
21:17:04 <skwisgaar[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases shows the changes made in each update
21:32:40 <jesqow[m]> Hey, what is the safest way to download and install the element messenger apk? I was able to download the signal apk from their official website with no issues. However for element the only alternative for the Google play store is F-Droid.. should F-Droid be avoided? Thanks!
21:32:54 <BlueBerryKush2> F-Droid is generally trusted
21:33:10 <BlueBerryKush2> I havent looked to see if F-Droid does any security check of their apps
21:33:28 <BlueBerryKush2> But generally if the true app devleoper publishes their app on f-droid, you can trust it
21:33:46 <BlueBerryKush2> Just make sure the actual true devleoper posted the real app to F-Droid
21:33:54 <BlueBerryKush2> the app you see could be a fake virus apk
21:33:56 <BlueBerryKush2> potentially
21:34:41 <jesqow[m]> <BlueBerryKush2 "Just make sure the actual true d"> That is the case
21:34:53 <BlueBerryKush2> Ok, if the devleoper links to Fdroid
21:34:59 <BlueBerryKush2> then Its probably safe
21:35:03 <BlueBerryKush2> unless the repo has been hacked
21:35:07 <BlueBerryKush2> or MITM occurs
21:37:18 <jesqow[m]> The apk download is available on f-droid, but the f-droid recommends that its more sage to download the f-droid client, and then download the app from there. What are your thoughts?

21:38:22 <BlueBerryKush2> Download F-Droid
21:38:24 <BlueBerryKush2> Apk
21:38:26 <BlueBerryKush2> Update
21:38:33 <BlueBerryKush2> Then install apk from within fdroid
21:38:47 <BlueBerryKush2> I use F-Droid as my primary app market
21:38:51 <BlueBerryKush2> I dont use Google play, aurora etc

22:07:11 <magento> Hey
22:08:15 <magento> Could Firefox be made secure enough with manual tweaking?
22:08:18 <magento> Such as
22:08:52 <BlueBerryKush2> secure enough for what
22:09:05 <BlueBerryKush2> I reccomend following the FireFox Browser tweaks on privacytools.io
22:09:13 <magento> Fission, Win32k lockdown, Disabling Javascript JIT, asm.js, ion, WebAssembly

22:10:00 <BlueBerryKush2> Well
22:10:11 <BlueBerryKush2> De-Googled Chromium probably has better sandboxing
22:10:18 <BlueBerryKush2> FireFox is notorious for having sub-par sandboxing
22:10:44 <flawedworld[m]> <magento "Fission, Win32k lockdown, Disabl"> You will not be able to solve these issues by just tweaking firefox
22:11:54 <magento> Most of the things mentioned in Madaidan's article can be tweaked manually in Firefox, so

22:13:05 <BlueBerryKush2> I hope your OS is Linux to begin
22:13:12 <magento> Yeah
22:14:09 <flawedworld[m]> You are not going to be able to solve key architectural issues by tweaking firefox
22:14:19 <BlueBerryKush2> I reccomend using ApPArmor And a Firewall

22:15:22 <magento> That's such a vague term to be honest

22:19:03 <ChristopherT[m]> If I made a company which preloaded GrapheneOS on Pixels for people and charged a flat rate would I get sued? I think there is a market for preloading this OS.

22:19:42 <BlueBerryKush2> I agree Chris
22:19:59 <BlueBerryKush2> But if your computer gets hacked, then people who bought your flashed GOS phones get hacked

22:36:29 <akc3n[m]> Will do.
22:36:32 <strcat[m]> SomeOddName124 via IRC webchat, often jumps into an existing conversion, generally pretends to be an expert and is giving people advice / answering questions with incorrect answers, often conflicting with the advice from the GrapheneOS project
22:36:51 <strcat[m]> often appears to be acting in good faith but that's just part of their overall act
22:37:02 <strcat[m]> they've evaded being banned literally a thousand times and keep doing the same thing
22:37:33 <strcat[m]> they'll keep going on and on saying things that increasingly don't make sense and misinform people + lead to them making bad choices
22:38:18 <strcat[m]> they are particularly focused on certain things like LTE only mode and their concept of a 'voice print modifier' via changing the pitch of your voice to supposedly avoid surveillance rather than using encryption (makes no sense)
22:38:26 <strcat[m]> anyway, if you see them around, please ping me or TheJollyRoger
22:38:57 <strcat[m]> they pretty much take over the channels and make it all about their pet topics where they dump piles and piles of the same misinformation, over and over again, totally ignoring all past discussions / responses to it, again and again
22:39:18 <strcat[m]> there is NO POINT engaging in discussion with this person, they will totally ignore everything you say, and come back in a few minutes/hours/days to do exactly the same act
22:39:30 <strcat[m]> totally disregarding anything that was said in response, going through the same stuff agai
22:39:33 <strcat[m]>  * totally disregarding anything that was said in response, going through the same stuff again
22:39:35 <strcat[m]> they're a troll
22:40:03 <strcat[m]> they also get mad about being banned and then start doing more maliciously things in response
22:40:08 <strcat[m]> super tired of it
22:42:21 <faxing[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "faxing: are you good with adb or"> Still no dice sadly
22:44:25 <covid-1984[m]> <strcat[m] "they are particularly focused on"> Sounds like what someone would want not to hide, but to harass people anonymously over the phone (the "voice pitch modifier").
22:49:00 <lackshan[m]> I'm currently exploring the requirements for esim support. It appears that a new system app (LPA) is needed (would have to be included in the grapheneos image). Is there any possibility of including such an app if I were to build it?
22:50:43 <akc3n> lackshan[m], GrapheneOS doesn't have a frontend app to manage or configure it at this point.
22:50:57 <akc3n> lackshan[m], https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/159
22:52:41 <lackshan[m]> Yep I've read that issue 😛
22:52:55 <lackshan[m]> I'd like to create both the back end and the UI
22:53:17 <lackshan[m]> AFAIK the UI app can be a regular system app
22:53:42 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <strcat[m] "they are particularly focused on"> Bruh what
22:54:33 <strcat[m]> they have pushed their voice modulator thing 200 times
22:54:41 <strcat[m]> they've talked about it in emails to me and 100 times here
22:54:53 <strcat[m]> they see it as a valid alternative to encryption
22:55:23 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense, alright?
22:55:33 <covid-1984[m]> It makes sense if you use it for what I was saying above
22:55:39 <covid-1984[m]> To harass people
22:55:51 <covid-1984[m]> A layman would want the most secure phone to use to do it to avoid tracking

22:57:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> covid-1984: treating it as an alternative to encryption?
22:58:24 <covid-1984[m]> That's why I said layman... They wouldn't even bother to understand the distinction
22:58:41 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's not really useful anyway, and if people are giving advice to harass people, that'd be pretty bad...
22:59:35 <covid-1984[m]> I'm not sure of course, but that's my first impression of why a person would act like that and want that specific thing.
23:01:53 <lackshan[m]> akc3n Thanks! I'll get in touch once I have something concrete to show
23:02:14 <covid-1984[m]>  * A layman would Google stuff like "least trackable" and "most secure" phones to find GOS
23:03:24 <akc3n> lackshan[m], you're welcome.
23:04:30 <lackshan[m]> So to test a system app, do I have to build aosp/grapheneos
23:04:52 <lackshan[m]> Because if so I might need to get another ssd
23:08:19 <akc3n> lackshan[m], Hopefully a developer or someone with experience will be along shortly, and help answer your question. I have no experience nor am I qualified to answer that.
23:08:46 <lackshan[m]> Ah no worries then
