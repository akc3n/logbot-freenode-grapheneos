00:26:06 <ephemeralang[m]> What do you guys use to unzip file archives on android / graphene?
00:29:21 <m2tu[m]> anyone know why, when i change system.mk files in build tree it does not generate new system.img after m commadn ?
00:36:44 <BobSacmanto[m]> Was grapheneos stable release for pixel 4a first released on nov 3 2020?
00:38:05 <Ashley12396> hello
00:46:12 <rny> BobSacmanto[m]: pls check the website
00:46:14 <rny> Ashley12396: hi
00:53:04 <Ashley12396> Does 'Allow App backgorund Sync' affect SMS
00:57:47 <BobSacmanto[m]> rny: i did but it is not clear and from want I can tell it was first released on nov 3 2020
00:58:07 <rny> BobSacmanto[m]: then it was first released on 3/11/2020
00:59:40 <Ashley12396> Does 'Allow App backgorund Sync' affect SMS/Calls or just apps?
01:02:29 <Ashley12396> Hello
01:02:37 <Ashley12396> Does 'Allow App backgorund Sync' affect SMS/Calls or just apps? I disabled it to save battery
01:04:49 <rny> Ashley12396: haev you tried googling?
01:10:50 <zvl12[m]> <rny "Ashley12396: haev you tried goog"> maybe he is trying de-googling 🤪
01:18:16 <rny> wth
01:19:57 <louipc> huh
01:20:38 <louipc> you also need to kick btw
01:20:43 <louipc> oh nvm
01:24:19 <louipc> yea i think that'll work
01:35:34 <grapheneos_user_> Lmao
01:47:28 <ephemeralang[m]> Has anyone ever used avgsk d so much like?
02:18:29 <OceaniaDigital> Hi, my name is John, I am the CEO of an Australian startup MVNO named Oceania Digital
02:19:21 <OceaniaDigital> Firstly my immense thanks go to Daniel Micay for this marvellous os
02:21:12 <OceaniaDigital> We have a serious ongoing problem with a criminal entitiy who has obtained LEA grade intrusion tools and is trying desperately to compromise latest beta on pixel 4a
02:22:07 <OceaniaDigital> The recovery logs show that grapheme was attacked mercilessy
02:22:58 <nux> OceaniaDigital: How did it fare the attacks?
02:23:01 <OceaniaDigital> But its still hanging. In there in an operable state but only just,,, many system files have has their sizes
02:23:14 <OceaniaDigital> Reduced to 0kb
02:23:46 <OceaniaDigital> I have removed the sim to reduce
02:23:54 <OceaniaDigital> Attack sirface
02:24:15 <nux> OceaniaDigital: What was the attack vector?
02:24:19 <OceaniaDigital> Can someone assist remotely
02:24:34 <OceaniaDigital> Via matrix to inspect
02:24:51 <OceaniaDigital> Lol vectors include
02:25:28 <OceaniaDigital> Imsi catchers patched into the real base station
02:25:57 <OceaniaDigital> Then connected via repurposed
02:26:41 <OceaniaDigital> P2p connection using sattelite TV dish to second dish
02:27:16 <OceaniaDigital> That has a bundle of cables running into the new 5g tower
02:27:36 <OceaniaDigital> I'm on HFC connection
02:27:43 <OceaniaDigital> Currently
02:27:47 <OceaniaDigital> :)
02:28:41 <nux> OceaniaDigital: Well, good luck with all that! Only parts of it made any sense to me...
02:28:57 <OceaniaDigital> These fuckers seem to be able to obtain the keys for almost all OS for all handsets
02:29:25 <OceaniaDigital> Their IMSI catchers are able to reflash innrealtime
02:29:53 <OceaniaDigital> Using ported pixel 3 rom
02:30:20 <OceaniaDigital> They have done some minimal damage to this latest beta
02:30:55 <OceaniaDigital> Can one of you guys message someone who can remote with me
02:31:23 <OceaniaDigital> To assess patching vulnerabities
02:31:39 <nux> OceaniaDigital: Even with locked bootloader and secure boot? Sounds doubtful.  Anyway, good luck and I hope you can get the assistance you need.
02:31:55 <OceaniaDigital> Cheers
02:32:28 <OceaniaDigital> The grapheme oS took the hit like a true figjter
02:33:09 <OceaniaDigital> But some things like the auditor app were. Reduced to 0kb
02:33:53 <OceaniaDigital> @nux yea doubtful but true
02:34:07 <strcat[m]> OceaniaDigital: you're just seeing things that are totally normally and then drawing these conclusions from them
02:34:09 <strcat[m]> you see what you want to see
02:34:15 <strcat[m]> you come here daily about this and it disrupts the channel
02:34:21 <OceaniaDigital> Lol they have nation state capabilities
02:34:28 <strcat[m]> talk to someone about it in private messages, it needs to stop in the channels
02:34:44 <strcat[m]> OceaniaDigital: GrapheneOS isn't going to solve any of your problems
02:35:13 <OceaniaDigital> I come here daily do i
02:35:47 <OceaniaDigital> This is the second time I have ever been here you lam3r
02:36:22 <wasabiStuck> Wondering if anybody can help me. I am trying to get my 3a flashed. I have managed to use Techlores guide up to the point that I go to actually flash the graphene rom. For some reason when in the boot loader the phone isnt being detected, but if I restart back into the OS and adb devices, it shows up. I can then adb reboot bootloader and as soon as
02:36:23 <wasabiStuck> it does, It is no longer detected. I have tried switching ports to no avail.
02:36:29 <OceaniaDigital> And with BTW with an omertadigital sim included
02:36:49 <strcat[m]> yes, you do
02:36:53 <OceaniaDigital> Then grapheme should have zero probs
02:36:54 <strcat[m]> you switch between tons of different usernames
02:37:03 <OceaniaDigital> Bullshi
02:37:05 <OceaniaDigital> T
02:37:12 <wasabiStuck> So at this point it is showing device is unlocked, but my laptop no longer detects the phone so I cant flash. Same story with the web installer not detecting it
02:37:16 <OceaniaDigital> Who are you
02:37:21 <strcat> OceaniaDigital:  stop coming to the channel and concern trolling
02:37:25 <strcat> OceaniaDigital: just stop
02:37:32 <strcat> OceaniaDigital: you aren't permitted here anymore
02:37:42 <strcat> I will ban anyone that remotely acts like you do
02:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> wasabiStuck: I'm going to stop you right there: following Techlore's guide is going to end you up with a brick.
02:38:15 <OceaniaDigital> I  will contact Daniel directly If you ban me
02:38:17 <OceaniaDigital> Kid
02:38:22 <strcat> go ahead
02:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> wasabiStuck: I can help you a bit;
02:38:58 <wasabiStuck> Ok, so I have not yet bricked the phone lol
02:39:11 <wasabiStuck> it is unlocked and i can restart back into android 11
02:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> So, first things first...
02:41:31 <TheJollyRoger> wasabiStuck: Techlore's guide is outdated and advises you to use a third-party platform tools package which doesn't support autodetection. While I'm not saying this can't work, I'm going to say that it will end you up with a brick half the time due to it not supporting autodetection. We now suggest using the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web .
02:41:44 <TheJollyRoger> The test is:
02:42:56 <TheJollyRoger> If you can unlock your phone's bootloader while it's in fastboot, but you can't flash the operating system, then at that point what that indicates is one of three things:
02:43:21 <TheJollyRoger> A) Your USB cable is missing a trace. This is actually very common, because not even the OEM cables are fully traced (however, they are sufficient for installing GrapheneOS).
02:43:47 <strcat[m]> it's not just outdated but was harmful and incorrect from the beginning
02:43:57 <strcat[m]> and he's now malicious towards the project and is more than happy to cause users to brick their devices
02:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> Er, sorry. Yeah.
02:44:00 <strcat[m]> he's a malicious person
02:44:10 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that. Yeah.
02:45:00 <TheJollyRoger> Most USB cables actually aren't fully traced, because most vendors don't bother adding all the features, which most users won't use. This means that the majority of cables are OK for use with MTP, or mass storage, or charging devices, but aren't actually going to help you do things like talk to the bootloader interface of a phone because the vendors never fully implemented the specification.
02:45:08 <TheJollyRoger> B) The same for your USB slot.
02:45:14 <TheJollyRoger> C) The same for your USB controller's firmware.
02:45:33 <strcat[m]> nux: it's best not to try to help people like that, they are just concern trolling, look how they bring up the 'omerta digital' nonsense and misspell the OS name how James Donaldson does
02:45:56 <strcat[m]> nux: it's just not worth engaging with them, either they are seriously mentally ill and are imagining things or they're a concern troll
02:46:02 <strcat[m]> either way we can't provide help to them
02:46:26 <strcat[m]> nux: I would prefer if they didn't use GrapheneOS because it isn't going to help them with their problems which are not technical issues
02:46:34 <strcat[m]> and that's assuming good faith
02:46:43 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "he's a malicious person"> Wait what? I know his installation guide is really bad and downright dangerous, but otherwise he seems OK (though it is bad that he gave a dangerous installation guide). Though I havent looked into him much so I don't know.
02:46:48 <strcat[m]> which is pretty hard to do when we see the same pattern from these suspicious accounts over and over
02:47:01 <strcat[m]> grapheneos_user_pi: he isn't otherwise okay
02:47:16 <strcat[m]> and if you haven't looked into it at all then there's not much point in giving input on it
02:47:28 <grapheneos_user_> Yeah I guess
02:48:40 <TheJollyRoger> wasabiStuck: If you find you can't unlock your phone at /all/, then this may signify you are missing a driver. If you're on Windows, Microsoft includes the driver optionally and if I recall correctly, you can obtain it through Windows Update optional updates. You won't need to download it from a website.
02:48:52 <wasabiStuck> The web installer is saying no devices detected. I made sure windows 10 was updated, and I thought I got the fastboot and adb drivers g2g. I was on here last night asking, because I started the process on my other machine running PopOS and got unlocked, and was direceted towards the web installer.
02:49:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, thought so - you're missing the driver. It should be an optional update and there should be a way to install it through Windows Update or the Device Manager.
02:49:57 <wasabiStuck> oh my god its there
02:50:03 <wasabiStuck> be right back
02:50:07 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
02:53:35 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "and if you haven't looked into i"> Oh yeah you're right, techlore lies about what you say and trues to portray you badly
02:53:43 <grapheneos_user_> And thats just one video
02:55:07 <grapheneos_user_> * Oh yeah you're right, techlore lies about what you say and tries to portray you badly
02:56:12 <edward60> The GrapheneOS IRC Channel Rules
02:56:13 <edward60> ================================
02:56:13 <edward60> Last updated September 13 2020
02:56:14 <edward60> Hello and welcome to the GrapheneOS IRC channel, which is bridged to
02:56:14 <edward60> Matrix. We try to be welcoming and flexible and operate under the
02:56:15 <edward60> honour system as much as possible, so please don't abuse it.
02:56:15 <edward60> 0. Rule Zero or the "Don't be a dick" rule applies. Don't engage
02:56:16 <edward60> in harassment, spamming, trolling, or flame wars. Don't impersonate
02:56:16 <edward60> developers or moderators, or spread misinformation.
02:56:17 <edward60> 1. Read the FAQ at https://grapheneos.org/faq in its entirety
02:56:17 <edward60> prior to posting.
02:56:18 <edward60> 2. Don't engage in bikeshedding. Bikeshedding is the act of fussing
02:56:18 <edward60> around trivialities that soak up mental bandwidth and divert resources
02:56:19 <edward60> away from handling bigger and more important problems. This includes
02:56:19 <edward60> certain topics such as:
02:56:20 <edward60>     A) Apps, service providers, or protocols that don't come with
02:56:20 <edward60>     GrapheneOS. Services such as mail, messaging, and cloud storage
02:56:21 <edward60>     services, are outside of GrapheneOS control and off-topic.
02:56:32 <edward60> With all that said, enjoy your stay and welcome to #GrapheneOS!
02:56:59 <strcat[m]> why are you posting this?
02:57:20 <edward60> So if these are the rules why would someone get booted for reporting real patchable security vulnerabilities
02:57:34 <strcat> edward60: no one was kicked for doing any such thing
02:57:44 <edward60> Am recording screen btw
02:57:51 <strcat> and?
02:58:28 <edward60> Well why did you kick that user
02:58:46 <strcat> edward60: for concern trolling and using sockpuppet accounts for ban evasion to continue their concern trolling from multiple accounts
02:59:08 <edward60> I traced his IP and dude wasn't even using a VPN
02:59:11 <strcat> edward60: and if this is the same person, well, that's just more ban evasion and sockpuppeting and is going to result in another ban
02:59:15 <strcat> edward60: and?
02:59:49 <strcat> edward60: if they bought a phone from Omerta for real they should get help from them, not us, and who knows if they actually put actual GrapheneOS on their phones
02:59:53 <nux> strcat[m]: Yeah, I detected that he might be a troll. I was merely trying to flush him out so we'd know for sure.
03:00:12 <strcat> edward60: they were absolutely not reporting any kind of vulnerability
03:00:27 <edward60> It seems you falsely accused a genuine
03:00:51 <strcat> edward60: there are 2 possibilities: A) they have serious mental illness and repeatedly come to the channel to post about their imagined scenarios which do not make any sense and do not conform to reality, and which are not consistent
03:00:54 <edward60> Look at the back trace mate
03:01:02 <strcat> edward60: B) more likely, they are a concern troll
03:01:06 <edward60> Went to launtel
03:01:08 <strcat> edward60: either way, GrapheneOS is not helpful to them
03:01:14 <strcat> edward60: and this channel is not helpful to them
03:01:37 <edward60> I believe it is of immense use to someone like that
03:01:40 <strcat> edward60: this is not a treatment facility for schizophrenia, we cannot help people with their clearly non-reality-based delusions, sorry
03:01:42 <strcat> no
03:01:44 <strcat> it is not
03:01:47 <strcat> it makes them problem worse
03:01:51 <strcat> their problem*
03:01:59 <edward60> How so?
03:02:17 <strcat> because they do not have a technical problem they have a mental health issue that needs treatment and feeding their delusions does not help them
03:02:28 <strcat> and it's far more likely it is concern trolling anyway
03:02:45 <edward60> Have you heard of a company called first point mobile guard
03:02:52 <strcat> several very obvious signs of concern trolling there
03:03:05 <strcat> if you can't see that, it's unfortunate
03:03:22 <edward60> That user is the exclusive Australian distributor for first point
03:03:43 <edward60> He messaged me and asked me to chat to you
03:04:23 <edward60> That user has been here twice I total
03:04:28 <strcat> edward60: what I see is someone who repeatedly comes to the channel and concern trolls
03:04:29 <edward60> In*
03:04:36 <strcat> edward60: and what's happening now is more of the same
03:04:42 <strcat> if you wanted to talk to me you would have sent me a PM
03:04:44 <edward60> Not a troll in anyway
03:04:48 <strcat> not tried to concern troll more based on banning another
03:04:49 <edward60> Shape or form
03:05:14 <strcat> edward60: then they can contact me and talk to me and convince me of that, which is going to be pretty hard
03:05:18 <strcat> based on what they posted here
03:05:24 <edward60> I'll post his Australian business number
03:05:29 <strcat> not helpful
03:05:35 <edward60> So you can verify
03:05:46 <strcat> I'm not verifying anything, I don't care who they are, I care what they did
03:06:00 <strcat> I don't care if they are a 13 year old in a basement or a 65 year old CEO of a major company
03:06:05 <strcat> it doesn't matter to me
03:06:25 <strcat> they were banned based on their behavior here
03:06:39 <strcat> they did not 'report' any vulnerability and trying to portray it as them being banned for reporting something like that
03:06:47 <strcat> is just further proof that they're a manipulative concern troll
03:07:08 <strcat> edward60: as I said, this does not belong in this channel, it's off-topic
03:07:09 <edward60> That seems at face value to be a statement that would indicate you are actively preventing reporting of security vulnerabilities
03:07:17 <strcat> edward60: this is not a place to dispute bans
03:07:31 <strcat> edward60: no, that's completely dishonest and manipulative behavior and has earned you a ban from the channel too
03:07:53 <Citizen528[m]> Lol
03:08:05 <louipc> howd he even know someone was banned when he wasnt in the chan at the time?
03:08:25 <strcat> coming here and making up stories is not "reporting a vulnerability" in any way
03:08:41 <strcat> there was no vulnerability reported
03:08:48 <strcat> no bug, vulnerability, or exploit was talked about
03:09:16 <wasabiStuck> TheJollyRoger: Thank you so much. Two days later but its working
03:09:58 <louipc> somethin fishy about them
03:10:03 <strcat[m]> I will link the logs so other people can see what this dishonest concern troll has been doing via multiple sockpuppets
03:10:46 <strcat[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210213#c6894108
03:10:47 <strcat[m]> this is very clearly concern trolling
03:10:47 <strcat[m]> I can go through and explain why that's the case, but I think it's pretty obvious
03:10:54 <strcat[m]> their attempt to use yet another sockpuppet account to continue this doesn't change anything
03:11:36 <strcat[m]> there is no report of a 'vulnerability' here, there is a concern troll making up stories that are not coherent or logical
03:11:50 <strcat[m]> please, look at that, and let me know where they reported any kind of vulnerability
03:12:35 <strcat[m]> and I'd also like to point out that misspelling the OS name that way is something that the Copperhead people do to try to degrade the project
03:12:50 <strcat[m]> and they repeatedly use sockpuppet accounts to try to cause drama with concern trolling
03:13:08 <strcat[m]> please, take a look at the log for yourself
03:13:13 <Citizen528[m]> How childish
03:13:30 <strcat[m]> let us look at one specific thing they said
03:13:31 <strcat[m]> > The recovery logs show that grapheme was attacked mercilessy
03:13:35 <strcat[m]> This makes absolutely no sense
03:13:45 <nux> strcat[m]: When he first intruduced himself, my troll red flags went up, haha! :P But I figured I'd give him the benefit of the doubt. Your exchange with him confirmed my suspicions.
03:13:48 <strcat[m]> the recovery log is a log of the boot process since recovery booted and what it has done
03:13:58 <strcat[m]> they are just saying nonsense that makes absolutely no sense
03:15:01 <strcat[m]> and by the way, I have a script which tracks when people joined the channel, etc. and I can look at their past messages, the IRC client they are using, etc. and figure out when it's the same person with their sockpuppets
03:15:29 <bypass1[m]> Hey!
03:15:46 <bypass1[m]> Wait wrong channel
03:15:48 <bypass1[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:15:59 <strcat[m]> the channel is logged so people can look through the logs themselves
03:16:18 <strcat[m]> there are certain keywords used by the sockpuppet accounts and you can go back and see how they try to disrupt the channel multiple times a day
03:16:36 <strcat[m]> went through exactly this same thing yesterday, the day before, and so on
03:16:40 <nux> strcat[m]: Anyway, good on you for calling him out!
03:16:48 <strcat[m]> maybe I should just close the channel to new users for a while
03:16:58 <strcat[m]> we can make a new channel providing help to new people
03:18:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Trolls aside this is an extremely valuable channel
03:18:37 <nux> mr_hebi_san[m]: +1
03:18:37 <strcat[m]> I do not have the time available to deal with the daily attacks on it from Copperhead and others
03:18:45 <strcat[m]> and people too easily fall for their concern trolling BS
03:19:55 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it
03:20:01 <mr_hebi_san[m]> He's in off topic now
03:20:17 <strcat> I can link IRC logs from past 5 days
03:20:22 <strcat> multiple times with this same BS every day
03:26:04 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat "I can link IRC logs from past 5 "> Yes please do. Its hilarious how copperhead screams about "grapheneos community slander us! We big sad!" And then does the exact thing they say we do
03:26:27 <strcat> grapheneos_user_: that's their overall strategy: they have been continuing to escalate malicious attacks of all kinds against us
03:26:32 <strcat> including spamming the channel with gore
03:26:35 <strcat> threatening contributors
03:26:36 <grapheneos_user_> James, stop projecting.
03:26:40 <strcat> spreading false narratives with their lies everywhere
03:27:00 <strcat> reaching out to anyone who supports / contributes / partners with us and trying to manipulate / mislead them and push them away from it
03:27:12 <strcat> every day, there are multiple people spending substantial time on this
03:27:33 <strcat> some of them simply come here to concern troll and waste our time + resources and try to make it seem like we are doing something wrong with moderating it
03:27:55 <strcat> and then they push the false narrative that it is us attacking them, and us doing these kinds of things
03:28:15 <strcat> we talk about what they're doing and they copy the words and try to project that as what we're doing
03:28:17 <strcat> it's nonsense
03:28:47 <grapheneos_user_> Its ridiculous. Copperhead trolls have such boring lives if this is what they do. I know you are watching. Go do something else. Maybe go for a walk, mess around, etc instead of slandering Grapheneos channels.
03:28:49 <strcat> James has severe narcissitic personality disorder, he is very manipulative and pathologically lies about things
03:28:55 <strcat> he believes his own lies to an extent
03:29:01 <strcat> he's obsessed with me and the project
03:29:06 <strcat> he obsessively tries to cause harm to us
03:29:08 <strcat> you can see that
03:29:17 <strcat> you can see his desperate tweets on Twitter and the stuff he does to try to do that
03:29:32 <strcat> I'm currently dealing with how they've contacted a bunch of people by email spreading their usual lies
03:29:36 <grapheneos_user_> Yeah I know, he can never answer any question straightforwardly
03:29:42 <strcat> some of those people emailed me about it and I'm now dealing with that
03:29:57 <strcat> the main thing I have to spend my time on is this nonsense
03:29:58 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat "I'm currently dealing with how t"> OK what the actual fuck
03:30:03 <grapheneos_user_> Spammers
03:31:28 <bypass1[m]> What is going on?
03:31:40 <bypass1[m]> Ill just read the Chat
03:32:39 <strcat> bypass1[m]: you joined the channel right after I banned someone
03:33:54 <bypass1[m]> Bro dont be paranoid
03:34:07 <bypass1[m]> I litreally joined just now
03:34:10 <bypass1[m]> Im koodab
03:34:32 <strcat> I recommend not getting involved in this
03:34:39 <bypass1[m]> I made 2 accounts
03:34:39 <take_a_deep_brea> its OK

04:11:32 <Lighwake[m]> I think there are people who come here with a problem and aren't able to word it correctly due to their lack of knowledge in tech. In fact, I've been in the same place too.
04:11:32 <Lighwake[m]> But this person was clearly not authentic. GrapheneOS  is an awesome project. And it's sad to see it being hijacked all the time.

04:23:26 <dnull> Can I post some back?
04:23:32 <strcat[m]> dnull: no
04:23:38 <dnull> :[
04:23:40 <dnull> Shame
04:23:46 <dnull> I'd win
04:23:53 <strcat[m]> dnull: you can counter what they do by spreading word about what they are doing including https://twitter.com/filosottile/status/1358231799458103297
04:24:13 <strcat[m]> don't spam anything, don't threaten anyone, don't try to manipulate people - those are their tactics, and leave that to them
04:24:21 <dnull> strcat[m]: Totally would if I had a twitter account
04:24:31 <strcat[m]> dnull: you can link it to people outside Twitter
04:24:35 <strcat[m]> and tell people what's going on
04:24:43 <dnull> strcat[m]: Done
04:24:44 <strcat[m]> show the desperate tweets by their CEO there trying to sweet talk jack
04:24:50 <strcat[m]> he spends every day doing that stuff for hours
04:24:58 <strcat[m]> making sockpuppet accounts, telling other people to do it too
04:25:01 <grapheneos_user_> He came back? Wtf lol
04:25:05 <strcat[m]> contacting tons of people by email, etc.
04:25:10 <grapheneos_user_> Oceania did I mean
04:25:16 <dnull> Copperhead was great because of your work.
04:25:26 <dnull> Fucked up what they did
04:25:30 <strcat[m]> CopperheadOS became GrapheneOS, it was renamed
04:25:37 <dnull> I know
04:25:38 <strcat[m]> I created CopperheadOS before there was a Copperhead company
04:25:54 <dnull> I know that too
04:25:57 <strcat[m]> my public use of the trademark predates theirs and I'll happily contest their registration of that too if they want
04:26:04 <strcat[m]> and will happily contest their ownership of the old domain
04:26:15 <dnull> I aas saying it was good because of your work
04:26:21 <dnull> Was*
04:26:37 <strcat[m]> if they keep escalating attacks on us I don't know what they expect to get from it aside from me taking multiple approaches to defending us from them and putting substantial effort into it
04:26:51 <strcat[m]> dnull: well all I'm saying is that the original CopperheadOS still exists, as GrapheneOS, and is still great
04:27:02 <dnull> Agreed
04:27:07 <strcat[m]> and their shoddy closed source fork of my work with tracking added to it is not the original project
04:27:18 <strcat[m]> and reflects poorly only on them, not the original project
04:27:20 <dnull> Looking at a Pixel 4 xl so I can use it again
04:27:43 <strcat[m]> dnull: I recommend a 4a or the 4a 5G / 5 if you want a higher end device
04:27:51 <strcat[m]> 4a is main recommendation
04:28:00 <dnull> Thought it was still alpha
04:28:02 <strcat[m]> 4a 5G / 5 are a step up with somewhat better hardware
04:28:06 <strcat[m]> dnull: 4a is fully supported / stable
04:28:13 <strcat[m]> dnull: 4a 5G / 5 are experimental
04:28:15 <dnull> But I'm willing to test
04:28:21 <dnull> Ah
04:28:26 <strcat[m]> dnull: the 4a 5G / 5 releases are available now though
04:28:37 <dnull> I saw that. Danle
04:28:39 <strcat[m]> they'll only be experimental until we get enough reports of it working perfectly
04:28:43 <dnull> Grr
04:28:46 <dnull> Danke*
04:28:52 <strcat[m]> and we need to go over the new commits a few more times reviewing it
04:28:53 <dnull> Gotcha
04:28:56 <strcat[m]> making sure there are no mistakes
04:29:03 <strcat[m]> and we need to go over other things checking for missing changes / mistakes
04:29:07 <dnull> Will get that to test then
04:29:16 <strcat[m]> so until then we have to keep it flagged experimental but it does already appear to work fine
04:29:21 <strcat[m]> that's just not good enough to say it's production ready
04:29:24 <dnull> Right
04:29:30 <strcat[m]> might have missed an important change
04:37:27 <pnrxa[m]1> <dnull "Looking at a Pixel 4 xl so I can"> I got a second hand 4 XL as the specs are better but the battery life is pretty average. Excited that there are now experimental 5 builds
04:37:39 <strcat[m]> back to dealing with the mess they caused emailing people their false claims
04:37:54 <strcat[m]> ping me if they spam the channel or if more people come making up clearly false nonsense
04:38:03 <strcat[m]> or ping another mod
04:38:12 <strcat[m]> I will look into making more people into mods
04:38:18 <pnrxa[m]1> Who else is a mod here?
04:38:33 <strcat[m]> can see the list at the top of the Matrix list of users
04:38:43 <strcat[m]> some people are mods on irc side, some on the Matrix side
04:38:46 <strcat[m]> some are both
04:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> Aye sir.
04:38:51 <rny> mods hide in the shadows waiting to pounce
04:39:01 <rny> pounce on unsuspecting trolls
04:39:04 <strcat[m]> need both because you can't properly moderate matrix side from irc and you can't moderate irc at all from matrix
04:39:10 <strcat[m]> irc mod is more powerful
04:39:14 <strcat[m]> but still need matrix mods
04:39:47 <grapheneos_user_> Because of...recent events?
04:40:09 <strcat[m]> I was talking to matrix.org admins to get some stuff done but Element is terrible and I've lost the chat room among 1000 others that are open
04:40:18 <strcat[m]> need to find it and ping them
04:40:21 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <strcat[m] "show the desperate tweets by the"> I'm more amused that Jack tweeted out to boost a project about privacy and security from corporate and government overreach 😁
04:41:18 <rny> mr_hebi_san[m]: dont think the project has an agenda on corproate/government overreach
04:41:37 <rny> pls dont fuse politics into a project
04:41:48 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I suppose that's fair enough
04:49:14 <strcat> I guess that guy gave up on pretending he wasn't here to troll though
04:49:42 <grapheneos_user_> By the way, given how mentally ill Oceania digital wasstrcat expect him to come back. Im not missing it the third time lol
04:50:16 <grapheneos_user_> Cuz those ramblings were of insanity
04:50:50 <strcat> just an idiotic troll
04:50:59 <strcat> not actually crazy just stupid and making stuff up
04:52:07 <somenerd[m]> yeah
04:52:25 <grapheneos_user_> I disagree, copperhead trolls would be more manipulative in their slander. This guy was just...well...
04:52:36 <grapheneos_user_> Ya know...
04:53:18 <somenerd[m]> I mean, they could be considered as concern trolling
04:54:10 <strcat> grapheneos_user_: well they started out a lot more subtle
04:54:17 <grapheneos_user_> Please be him please be him
04:54:17 <strcat> then seemingly got really pissed that I saw through it and shut it down
04:54:47 <grapheneos_user_> Jk lol
04:54:47 <somenerd[m]> > grapheneos_user_pi: well they started out a lot more subtle
04:54:47 <somenerd[m]> yeah and now they're just saying nonsense
04:54:48 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat "grapheneos_user_pi: well they st"> True

04:57:26 <grapheneos_user_> <somenerd[m] "the bridge is screwed up ig "> Well yeah but I mean what happened to make it screwed up?
04:57:35 <somenerd[m]> it just bugs out randomly

04:57:43 <grapheneos_user_> Or whats happening
04:57:48 <grapheneos_user_> <somenerd[m] "it just bugs out randomly "> Ok

05:00:09 <strcat> don't ask me how that makes any sense, lol

05:08:33 <somenerd[m]> instead of a link
05:08:48 <grapheneos_user_> <ryan[m]4 "Did I fortunately miss some gore"> Open the log and look at Edward60 and Oceania's messages
05:09:43 <ryan[m]4> No thanks

05:12:11 <strcat> after dealing with it daily
05:12:54 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat "after dealing with it daily"> yeah that is true...its only funny if we don't have to deal with it ourselves
05:12:59 <ryan[m]4> Can we disable images in the room?
05:13:11 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat "after dealing with it daily"> It really shouldn't happen
05:13:16 <strcat[m]> ryan: you can disable previews of images in your matrix client
05:13:16 <grapheneos_user_> Optimally
05:13:20 <strcat[m]> I don't think I can disable it for the room
05:13:33 <somenerd[m]> > it's not really funny
05:13:33 <somenerd[m]> it's funny the first few times
05:13:38 <ryan[m]4> Sure, but I mean to stop people from seeing them on accident
05:13:38 <strcat[m]> Enable URL previews by default for participants in this room
05:13:40 <strcat[m]> this id disabled
05:13:41 <somenerd[m]> and then it gets repeated so many times
05:13:45 <strcat[m]> but most clients seem to enable it anyway
05:13:49 <strcat[m]>  * this is disabled
05:13:55 <somenerd[m]> can see why people get sick of it
05:14:05 <strcat[m]> toggled it on and off to try refreshing the setting
05:14:10 <strcat[m]> don't really think that setting does anything
05:14:40 <ryan[m]4> Are they linking the images or adding the image to the message?
05:15:30 <strcat> ryan[m]4: they weren't doing it today
05:15:46 <strcat> ryan[m]4: they were just making up stories / nonsense and then they started spamming some of their usual lies
05:16:35 <ryan[m]4> Oh
05:17:23 <ryan[m]4> The last time I saw spammers here it was images I still have burned into my head
05:17:41 <ryan[m]4> Some dark shit

06:26:08 <lasttryforrealsi> already in the middle of it thanks
06:26:31 <googlecookie[m]> warmjuice: Flashing Graphene could be quite exciting!
06:26:42 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
07:47:29 <darkwhite[m]> i was having trouble installing i had to modify the flash-all script to work.
07:48:08 <darkwhite[m]> kinda annoying
07:48:19 <darkwhite[m]> but its working now
08:00:50 <darkwhite[m]> also how would i compile graphene os for other devices?
08:05:13 <louipc> darkwhite[m]: what os do you use
08:05:38 <darkwhite[m]> linux
08:06:55 <somenerd[m]> guess they mean the distro as well
08:07:18 <darkwhite[m]> guess so
08:07:19 <darkwhite[m]> DEBIAN
08:07:31 <darkwhite[m]> there
08:08:12 <Joe939475493> Hello.  Suddenly grapheneos is not allowing screenshots to be saved, stating "Taking screenshots isn't allowed by the app or your organization".  I don't have any permissions I've changed that would have caused this, any ideas?
08:08:35 <rny> the app disabled screenshots
08:08:43 <rny> nothing to do with grapheneos
08:08:54 <darkwhite[m]> <Joe939475493 "Hello.  Suddenly grapheneos is n"> some apps wont allow it
08:09:05 <Joe939475493> I can't even screenshot my homepage
08:09:06 <darkwhite[m]> try digging in app settings
08:09:24 <darkwhite[m]> <Joe939475493 "I can't even screenshot my homep"> weird
08:09:28 <Joe939475493> I went through permissions and couldn't find anything that would have caused it, very confused
08:10:21 <rny> Joe939475493: you'll have to give us a lot more than just "X does not work" to help you
08:10:41 <jon_osterman[m]> Hello! 🙂 will Graphene ever support phones beside Pixels?
08:10:42 <rny> what other apps have you installed?
08:10:47 <rny> jon_osterman[m]: no.
08:10:56 <jon_osterman[m]> Tnx
08:11:12 <Joe939475493> F-Droid, Notally, K-9 email, that's it
08:11:34 <rny> Joe939475493: how did you install graphene os?
08:11:39 <rny> are you even sure you are using graphene os

08:11:57 <somenerd[m]> I mean, it depends on if the phones are meeting the requirements
08:12:12 <rny> and no other phones meet the requirements atm
08:12:15 <rny> so no :?
08:12:34 <Joe939475493> Yes, installed via webusb from https://grapheneos.org/install/web
08:12:34 <rny> ffs, if someone cannot be bothered reading the site, TL;DR NO is the right answer.
08:12:37 <somenerd[m]> I guess? I mean they said ever
08:12:51 <somenerd[m]> > ffs, if someone cannot be bothered reading the site, TL;DR NO is the right answer.
08:12:52 <somenerd[m]> which people usually don't
08:12:53 <somenerd[m]> idk why
08:13:13 <rny> thats because they arent looking for the right answers.
08:13:30 <darkwhite[m]> no its cuz im lazy af lol
08:13:43 <somenerd[m]> we weren't referring to you?
08:13:56 <rny> lazy people should be given binary answers.
08:14:24 <darkwhite[m]> oh sorry i just popped in after asking how to build graphene from source for other devices
08:14:35 <darkwhite[m]> and saw that
08:14:40 <somenerd[m]> we weren't referring to you
08:14:48 <somenerd[m]> check the messages above

08:18:35 <Preload[m]> <rny "ffs, if someone cannot be bother"> I think the best solution is to point them to the right path, in this case the official website. Eventually they will learn to research it on their own, I hope.
08:19:17 <somenerd[m]> I mean, it's a rule to read the site FAQ
08:22:07 <Preload[m]> <somenerd[m] "I mean, it's a rule to read the "> Yeah, but most people don't read them. That's why I think that it's important to actively encourage people to read before asking questions.

08:22:50 <somenerd[m]> idk
08:25:28 <somenerd[m]> > gotta make rules more visible
08:25:29 <somenerd[m]> yeah
08:28:19 <somenerd[m]> hmm
08:29:18 <somenerd[m]> sure
08:31:08 <take_a_deep_brea> <somenerd[m] "I mean, it's a rule to read the "> gotta make rules more visible
08:31:08 <Preload[m]> It's also why most YouTubers have a pinned comment that should have gone in the description. I dunno, just a guess.
08:31:08 <Preload[m]> I think the most effective way to point them towards the website is to ask if they have read the available information.
08:31:08 <Preload[m]> Continuing in offtopic.
08:32:16 <Preload[m]> Actually, nvm. Lost confidence over that brain fart of mine.
08:33:53 <take_a_deep_brea> lol

17:32:07 <g7x[m]> i recall having issues with graphene when i first started playing with it with pretty much any sim having low reception and slow data which is why i've been riding hotspots and wifi for a long time
17:36:41 <zvl12[m]> <g7x[m] "i recall having issues with grap"> i have it installed on a 4a with a tmobile sim... and its fast.. i am using a vpn on top of it... and still data is good

17:54:53 <bypassbobby[m]> Hello people I've got graphene installed and can't seem to get .apks to install on other profiles than the admin
17:57:10 <take_a_deep_brea> you mean fdroid , i hope. also there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  for discussion about apps . please ask there too
17:57:58 <bypassbobby[m]> Want to install wickr and signal on profiles that are not admin
17:58:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> bypassbobby also make sure it's a user and not the Guest
17:58:31 <sierocharlie[m]> Is it correct that Apps can only be installed once throughout all profiles? E.g. if installed in profile 1 it can't be installed nor accessed in profile 2. Because I am failing to install an app in profile 2 that is installed in profile 1.
17:59:01 <bypassbobby[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "bypassbobby also make sure it's "> It's a new user it just says can not install even though permissions are enabled
17:59:31 <bypassbobby[m]> <sierocharlie[m] "Is it correct that Apps can only"> If that's true that explains my problem
17:59:47 <bypassbobby[m]> I've got the apps installed on my admin
17:59:54 <mr_hebi_san[m]> The app version must be the same or higher in the new profile
18:00:11 <take_a_deep_brea> @sierocharlie:  what that means is that the same app installed on diff users does not correspond to diff apks
18:00:23 <sierocharlie[m]> ?
18:00:33 <sierocharlie[m]> Basically I cannot install an app already installed on another profile.
18:00:41 <sierocharlie[m]> Like I can't get fdroid on two profiles
18:01:06 <sierocharlie[m]> Or any APK for that matter, because I have a profile set-up for travelling through customs and I would still like opencamera on there
18:01:26 <take_a_deep_brea> if i have fdroid installed in both owner and a secondary profile
18:02:07 <take_a_deep_brea> then it corresponds to same apk
18:02:28 <take_a_deep_brea> fdroid has an issue
18:02:49 <take_a_deep_brea> the main download of fdroid apk available is an older version
18:03:18 <mr_hebi_san[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
18:03:43 <sierocharlie[m]> Right, so it is specifically related to f-droid. So I'd be able to have installed let's say opencamera on two profiles with the exact same version?
18:04:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> @sierocharlie go there and find the specific link I'm going to post a pic to
18:04:24 <m2tu[m]> is it possible to change bootlogo name from GrapheeneOS to Pixel3 ? from build ?
18:04:24 <take_a_deep_brea> so after a particular install of fdroid it updates to the latest fdroid build
18:04:27 * mr_hebi_san[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210212-154339_1_1.png (63KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pUncnoxWkQHOOXBGWJhFRRIz/Screenshot_20210212-154339_1_1.png >
18:04:28 <take_a_deep_brea> and so if you download same apk in a diff profile
18:04:29 <take_a_deep_brea> then because of OS not allowing app version rollback
18:04:36 <take_a_deep_brea> it wont allow the outdated apk to be installed ina user profile
18:04:59 <sierocharlie[m]> mr_hebi_san: Thanks! So it's just F-droid. But I will be able to download same APK's of other applications on multiple profiles?
18:05:30 <take_a_deep_brea> i will go mad if matrix continues to lag like this lmao
18:05:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> @sierocharlie it is like take_a_deep_breath|mare described
18:06:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> If you installed or updated an app in any profile...
18:06:52 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Then if you install that app on a different profile it must be at least the same or higher version as the highest version already installed.
18:07:07 <bypassbobby[m]> <m2tu[m] "is it possible to change bootlog"> That would be a good idea.
18:07:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Fdroid itself is one of the most troublesome because of their site UI
18:07:45 <m2tu[m]> i cant find where it is located
18:07:52 <sierocharlie[m]> But I am using f-droid 1.11 APK on one profile. And I can't install 1.11 on another profile
18:08:07 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks ayway
18:08:10 <sierocharlie[m]> anyway*
18:11:49 <bypassbobby[m]> Also if I have a VPN running on admin how can I get the other users to use that connection?
18:12:10 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Install the VPN on the other users
18:12:58 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It isn't a solution for Guest but it is fine for manually created users
18:14:58 <take_a_deep_brea> could we further carry on this discussion about apps in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  ?
18:19:48 <reanimatejoker[m> Looking to upgrade through my current carrier, sprint/tmobile. Before proceeding is it sure that the 4a 5G is oem unlockable?

21:47:00 <jcb[m]> <timetravelingman "Jacob is an extremely common wes"> I agree, and it is used in many countries. It's just my first time to encounter this situation and you know, paranoia has only too often proven in its place.
21:48:50 <jcb[m]> <timetravelingman "Screenshot_20210213-164018.png"> Now, if timetravelingman's 's name is Joe, then it's getting spooky
21:58:43 <nscnt[m]> jcb: What language have you set for the system?
21:59:44 <nscnt[m]> These example strings are fixed strings. It's the same for every user.
22:00:08 <nscnt[m]> They are different for the different languages.
22:02:40 <nscnt[m]> If you use English, it's Joe. If you use German it'll be Peter. Etc...
22:12:50 <MrJack> strcat layman here again.  i've been reading more about iommu to attempt to understand it better. According to replicant's site, "it is probably possible to isolate modems with shared memory but it could require a big amount of work and/or require fully free bootloaders with IOMMU support," and "to have enough guarantee, such hardware should have
22:12:50 <MrJack> good technical documentation and the code using it should have good peer review (It should be good enough if it is in upstream Linux). Note that some IOMMUs are very complicated to setup in a secure way."  I know that for you the pixel's iommu graphene's high standards, but how does graphene handle the bootloader aspect?
22:15:10 <MrJack> Also, according to replicant site, "a device with bad modem isolation cannot prevent the modem from accessing and controlling key parts of the hardware. For instance the main CPU's RAM, its storage, the GPS, the camera, user I/O and the microphone."    I've read that trustzone in the processor is an issue because of the master key used for the
22:15:10 <MrJack> lock screen and encryption, and some consider it to be a backdoor.  According to what i've read from you elsewhere, pixels have switched to using titan m, so this is aspect is no longer an issue then if I understand correctly?  Any good sources to reference for these things?
22:20:16 <strcat[m]> MrJack: open source and security/privacy are separate things
22:20:25 <strcat[m]> nothing is required to be open source to have proper IOMMU support
22:20:27 <strcat[m]> an iPhone has it
22:20:51 <strcat[m]> there is nothing open source about any ARM SoC
22:21:09 <strcat[m]> I'm really not sure what you think it has to do with the bootloader
22:21:58 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm publishes the EDK2 (late stage bootloader and all the functionality like fastboot, etc) and the very early boot stages are shared source and that in no way helps with anything like this
22:22:16 <strcat[m]>  * Qualcomm publishes the late stage bootloader code as open source including all the functionality like fastboot, etc. and the very early boot stages are shared source and that in no way helps with anything like this
22:22:44 <strcat[m]> MrJack: this is covered on our site
22:22:50 <strcat[m]> I don't understand what you're asking me
22:23:01 <strcat[m]> I suggest getting information from accurate, technical sources rather than inaccurate ones
22:23:40 <strcat[m]> MrJack: and what you're saying about the TEE is just FUD that's not based on how things actually work, and I won't respond to that

23:24:54 <southwest[m]> Greetings all. Anyone having issues in a secondary profile when ending session and switching to owner - the screen briefly shows the owner's homescreen with no keyboard? After a 40 seconds, then displays the wallpaper with the prompt to login.
23:27:03 <MrJack> thanks for the information strcat.  Didn't mean to make it sound like I was asserting anything about how things work or asking to be spoonfed. Just trying to clarify all these intricacies and terms that are new to me and go over my head, and I've been stumbling around the web cross referencing different sources whose credibility i'm in the dark
23:27:04 <MrJack> about.  i have a family member who recently bought a cheap android phone, and i'm not sure if my attempts to increase their privacy by degoogling/debloating their preloaded rom has any impact at all (or on any non-pixel phone for that matter), or the phone is compromised regardless.
23:27:48 <strcat[m]> MrJack: in all likelihood it's very insecure and you are quite possibly making things worse by cutting them off from the updates to components they could get
23:27:57 <TheJollyRoger> MrJack: indeed getting your family member on a "different ROM" has had an impact on their privacy: but it's the reverse of what you want.
23:28:00 <chingle[m]> <southwest[m] "Greetings all. Anyone having iss"> I'm pretty sure you have to swipe up
23:28:15 <strcat[m]> MrJack: anyway that's off-topic for here
23:28:46 <chingle[m]> southwest Then the PIN or whatever you use appears.
23:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> Mr. It's likely made it far, far, far, FAR worse because now they're on what's likely an insecure handset, that's now not getting updates, and is likely had many of its security policies disabled or rolled back.
23:28:53 <southwest[m]> <chingle[m] "I'm pretty sure you have to swip"> Yes - forgot to mention that. Even with a swipe up, there is a delay before entering in the pin.
23:29:20 <TheJollyRoger> whoops, @ MrJack
23:29:41 <skwisgaar[m]> southwest: I’ve been experiencing a similar issue for a while now.
23:29:58 <nscnt[m]> southwest: Yes, it's a known issue. See https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/435
23:30:13 <southwest[m]> Good to know. Just thought I would bring it up.  thanks
23:30:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I get it too.
23:31:00 <southwest[m]> Spent the day first wit ha factory reset then the web-installer. :-) Which is very nice by the way.
23:31:10 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship, southwest[m]!
23:31:28 <southwest[m]> Thanks ! hope to be a beta tester soon.
23:31:55 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! We definitely need some of those.
23:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> Since GrapheneOS doesn't include any crash reporting or telemetry though, it does require a bit of a commitment to send in the "It works, it's good" quickly after the beta updates go out, or "It's broken, help!" as fast as possible.
23:32:52 <southwest[m]> Just need to get faster. Then can help. TheJollyRoger
23:32:58 <TheJollyRoger> I have a small check list here: https://gist.github.com/Peter-Easton/7046760bdeccb522839c4755824160ba
23:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> Right on!
23:33:12 <southwest[m]> I really appreciate everyone here. Such good information.
23:33:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
23:33:22 <southwest[m]> Will check it out.
23:33:39 <chingle[m]> I might as well get onto the beta too.
23:34:07 <chingle[m]> Whatever helps the project.
23:34:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The more people that are on beta and are either calling back with "It works, nothing that wasn't broken before is newly broken." or "Help, this new update broke something, here's how to reproduce it!" and can file issues on Github can help with the stability.
23:35:25 <TheJollyRoger> Since the idea is, updates go to beta, and those need to be tested for new breakages in live environments before they make it to stable. Sometimes the window is extremely short, like we're talking "within less than a day" so beta testers need to be on the ball and ready.
23:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> The good news is, you don't need to do much more with your phone than use it, as you normally would: make calls, browse the internet, download and install (and uninstall) apps, check to ensure that PDFs render, listen to music, try out alarms and timers, take pictures with your cameras and video, use the microphones, try using USB devices, turn your phone on and off, etc.
23:37:07 <skwisgaar[m]> I am often in a secondary profile, so I usually miss that a beta update even installed. Might be useful if someone pinged this room for each new update.
23:37:17 <TheJollyRoger> It's important that when doing beta tests, we only check for stuff that is *newly broken*, not stuff that was previously broken, so before becoming a beta tester, take some time to get familiar with the ins and outs of your phone
23:37:32 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: Good thinking actually: I've set up a separate channel at #grapheneos-beta - that room I don't use for chatting much,
23:37:47 <TheJollyRoger> but people in it can get pings from me when new updates are going out, and I'll remind you to send in reports.
23:38:20 <southwest[m]> That's very helpful.
23:38:22 <skwisgaar[m]> Oh awesome I didn’t realize, I’ll have to join.
23:38:52 <chingle[m]> All I need to do to get the beta is change the release from "stable"  to "beta" in the settings right?
23:38:52 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. It's not bridged to matrix at the moment, so you'll have to join via Freenode's bridging.
23:39:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, all you need to do is change to "beta" and it will become effective at the next beta release.
23:39:37 <southwest[m]> Also keep up on the Issue Tracker to know what is known.
23:39:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
23:40:24 <TheJollyRoger> Try to get familiar with the phone as well, in the time leading up to then. GrapheneOS may take some getting used to, if you're previously from an Android (with Google) background.
23:41:43 <southwest[m]> Yea or (gulp) iOS
23:42:05 <TheJollyRoger> Since apps that are hardcoded to depend on Google Software Frameworks and Google Play Services may crash or may flat-out refuse to run even if installed.
23:42:48 <BobSacmanto[m]> Where can you download the official pixel ROM if you decide to restore yoir phone to the Google pixel rom
23:43:08 <TheJollyRoger> With the exception of Auditor and Vanadium, the apps aren't our bug in Graphene, since they come from different places.
23:43:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hey BobSacmanto[m] Google publishes their own factory images, let me go and get them for you.
23:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> https://developers.google.com/android/images The system images released by Google are here. Note that there is one extra step you must take while the bootloader is unlocked, and that's to erase GrapheneOS' keys from the bootloader.
23:45:03 <TheJollyRoger> That step is at the very bottom of the CLI install page.
23:45:31 <TheJollyRoger> There is also a web install tool Google has at that link, if you need to revert back to the operating system your phone came with.
23:46:21 <TheJollyRoger> Google's public key hashes are permanently fused into e-fuses in the phone's chip, so you won't need to use signify or get a GPG signature, they are verified on the phone itself.
23:47:43 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the firmware keys are burned into efuses but that's the same when using GrapheneOS
23:47:55 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the difference is for the OS verified boot keys
23:48:24 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
23:48:37 <strcat[m]> the late stage bootloader (verified from the immutable hardware root of trust) knows the stock OS verified boot key
23:48:57 <strcat[m]> for an alternate OS it uses the key that was flashed to the secure element
23:49:16 <TheJollyRoger> Oh I see, very different than I thought it was, then.
23:49:34 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the stock OS key is compiled into the late stage bootloader code
23:49:39 <strcat[m]> and that is verified from the hardware root of trust
23:49:54 <strcat[m]> the only keys that have to be flashed into efuses are the early firmware verified boot keys
23:50:20 <strcat[m]> and then everything after that can be verified via keys in the code
23:51:02 <strcat[m]> the efuse stuff is to configure what the hardware / boot ROM (i.e. firmware that can't be updated) will use
23:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Would it be more accurate for me to say something like "the phone already knows the stock OS keys" and just leave it at that, then?
23:53:41 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be right back.
23:53:47 <MrJack> Actually TheJollyRoger, I did not flash a custom rom.  I kept everything untouched besides revoking google services permissions and disabling 3rd party oem apps on my family member's phone.  It remains bootloader locked, unrooted and with the factory rom.  I'm well aware of the flaws strcat has criticized lineage and other "degoogled" roms for
23:53:48 <MrJack> having after as i've been reading up on all this best i could.  i know the graphene project takes these issues very seriously, which is why i ended up here for clarification.  This information is also helpful for me because I will be getting a new phone soon too, so i'll know better what to avoid and if graphene fits my use case.  Don't mean to
23:53:48 <MrJack> be off topic, and if this still is, just let me know and I won't say anymore about this here.
23:54:54 <strcat[m]> there's #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
23:55:00 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic on freenode
23:55:52 <strcat[m]> MrJack: and I don't know why you're saying "degoogled" about an OS like LineageOS where they don't do that
23:56:13 <strcat[m]> MrJack: best to not keep talking about off-topic things particularly when you're misinformed about them, I don't want to address it here
23:56:49 <strcat[m]> I said it's off-topic above and I want the discussion to end or at least move to the offtopic channel
23:56:56 <strcat[m]> but there is still a standard for discussions there
