00:00:12 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: what you're saying simply isn't how it behaves
00:00:27 <strcat[m]> and closing app activities is not required for permission changes to take effect
00:00:29 <strcat[m]> that's not accurate
00:00:49 <strcat[m]> they take effect immediately and if a permission is actually designed in a way that it requires an app restart the OS does that itself
00:00:54 <rny> zrtjjtaher[m]: you should reinstall
00:01:00 <strcat[m]> Network doesn't require that
00:01:07 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "did you remove permissions from "> I think I do not have enough knowledge of Android/GOS to be able to do that!! :-))
00:01:12 <strcat[m]> Network also isn't really something we created, we just made a toggle for it
00:01:27 <strcat[m]> along with proper handling for it being toggled dynamically
00:01:39 <strcat[m]> rather than just being a low-level non-user-facing install time permission
00:02:19 <strcat[m]> disabling Network disallows low-level socket access and indirect use of network via INTERNET perm
00:02:32 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "and closing app activities is no"> A user suggested to try to close the app and start it again. I had nothing to lose and tried. As you said, the test was irrelevant.
00:02:34 <strcat[m]> no app restart required (for any toggles)
00:02:59 <strcat[m]> I suggest by starting by using Auditor and making sure you do not have device managers or accessibility services
00:03:16 <strcat[m]> if you have a device policy manager or device manager then that's probably your issue
00:03:20 <strcat[m]> don't use those
00:04:30 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "I suggest by starting by using A"> what are "device managers" or "accessibility services"?
00:04:59 <strcat[m]> start by using Auditor to verify the device is running GrapheneOS without either of those kinds of things enabled
00:05:09 <nux> I just cracked open the box of a brand new Pixel 5 and am getting ready to, "GrapheneOS-ize" it! :P
00:05:30 <strcat[m]> device managers can break how the lockscreen works and permissions if you granted them those abilities
00:05:59 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <zrtjjtaher[m] "what are "device managers" or "a"> I don't think I installed special things: A 2FA app, VLC, Linphone, Signal, etc... Quite classic, I guess!
00:06:04 <sjsndnjdejd> <nux "I just cracked open the box of a"> noice
00:07:42 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "start by using Auditor to verify"> Can I use Auditor if I have not used it so far? Since I got GOS from the official site and verified it before install, I did not think I needed to use Auditor (but I am perhaps mistaken!!)
00:08:10 <nux> sjsndnjdejd: Yeah, pretty excited about it! I probably didn't need to upgrade from the 4a but the scarcity of ICs and general supply chain issues forced my hand! Who knows if/when it will be too difficult or expensive to upgrade in the near future?!!!
00:08:17 <rny> strcat[m]: the internet perm is named network in the permission toggle
00:08:18 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: you can use it at any time
00:08:34 <strcat[m]> rny: aware, and it applies to network, not internet
00:08:42 <strcat[m]> including localhost
00:09:10 <rny> should we make a internet-specific one?
00:09:17 <rny> do android apps even open sockets for localhost connections?
00:09:19 <rny> @_@
00:09:19 <rosie> @nux  Have fun!  I just installed GOS on a couple of 4as today.  Pretty easy if you use the Web installer.
00:09:50 <rny> i dont think i've used one that requires localhost sockets, should apps even do IPC via localhost sockets?
00:09:52 <rosie> The 5 is out of my price range, though.
00:10:20 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "zrtjjtaher: you can use it at an"> OK, if you tell me that Auditor may help solve my problem, I will look at it and come back if I still have the problem.
00:10:39 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Thank you very much for your support, Daniel!!
00:10:50 <strcat[m]> no it won't help your problem
00:10:51 <nux> rosie: I've done a few 4a devices via CLI but never the Web installer. I'm more comfortable with the CLI anyway. I like to see stuff at the CLI as it progresses.
00:11:06 <strcat[m]> but it will help you determine if you are actually running GrapheneOS and whether you have enabled an accessibility service or device manager
00:12:33 <rosie> @nux  I don't know whether things have changed since you last installed GOS, but the Web installer is very much the recommended method now.
00:13:10 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "but it will help you determine i"> Not sure how I could not run GOS or how a device manager or accessibility service (not sure what both of these are by the way) could have arrived in my phone but I am happy to try and learn more about the Auditor!
00:13:13 <nux> rosie: As long as the cli method is complete and functional, I'll go that route.
00:13:31 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: if you installed + enabled it in Settings
00:14:24 <nux> rosie: I have the evironment already set up on my Arch box so unless things changed drastically, it should be fine.
00:14:35 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "zrtjjtaher: if you installed + e"> Not sure what you  mean
00:15:22 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: have you disabled usage stats special access in Settings?
00:15:30 <strcat[m]> have you enabled a device manager or accessibility service?
00:15:36 <strcat[m]> you'll need to provide answers to those questions
00:15:41 <strcat[m]> as I recommended earlier, start with Auditor
00:17:17 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "have you enabled a device manage"> I don't remember having seen those terms so I guess the answer is simply "no".
00:20:00 <strcat[m]> did you use the Settings app to disable system apps and disable permissions for them?
00:20:19 <strcat[m]> it's entirely possible at the moment to break important stuff by toggling off usage stats perm for system apps, etc.
00:20:40 <strcat[m]> we have added a few things as disallowed that are inherently broken to do but it would be too much for us to go through and disallow doing anything broken
00:20:52 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "did you use the Settings app to "> That's easy! Answer is clearly NO!
00:21:29 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <zrtjjtaher[m] "That's easy! Answer is clearly N"> easy to answer, i mean
00:21:34 <rosie> @nux I fought with Arch for two days before I gave up and went with Debian.  And then I ended up using my Samsung 8 to actually install GOS because I don'
00:21:51 <rosie> I don't have a computer with a USB-C port.
00:22:08 <strcat[m]> installing from macOS and Windows works fine too
00:22:53 <strcat[m]> Arch is the easiest traditional Linux distribution to use (ChromeOS and Android via web install are easier) since it has proper packages available
00:23:15 <rosie> I don't have macOS, and my only access to Win10 is from a VM inside of Linux (which is not recommended for GOS install).  And I would still have the issue with the USB-C.
00:25:05 <rny> i wish arch had an option to not use gnu binutils
00:25:21 <rosie> In the end, using the Samsung 8 was fine (except the Samsung shut down twice because it was overheating).  After I got GOS on the first Pixel, I used that to install GOS on the 2nd one.
00:26:07 <rosie> I just couldn't make Arch work for me.
00:26:56 <rosie> It's very configurable, but it's NOT user-friendly.  And I couldn't find enough documentation that I could make sense of.
00:26:57 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <rny "zrtjjtaher: your claim about sig"> And by the way, @rny, thank you for your welcoming words! Much appreciated!!
00:28:19 <rny> are you trolling?
00:29:53 <strcat[m]> I get a strange impression from the replies and the initial story, waiting for more information such as Auditor results
00:30:45 <strcat[m]> best way to start resolving it is doing a local verification with Auditor
00:31:55 <entry1> @rny you're right 100% if network permission is denied, the app won't even open. I had no idea that would occur
00:32:47 <strcat[m]> entry1: it disallows apps from creating network sockets rather than simply making connections fail, some apps don't do proper error handling
00:32:56 <strcat[m]> it has to do work this way because it prevents leaks
00:33:04 <strcat[m]> it prevents app listening for connections even via localhost
00:33:09 <strcat[m]> and prevents them using indirect networking too
00:33:15 <strcat[m]> the typical approach doesn't work and I don't do things that way
00:33:42 <strcat[m]> you can get `adb logcat` output and report it to app developers
00:33:48 <strcat[m]> they can change their code to catch the exceptions
00:33:55 <strcat[m]> they should be doing that if they write robust code
00:34:24 <entry1> strcat very cool, my comment wasn't a complaint by any stretch. Thanks for the explanation!
00:34:30 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: are you checking with Auditor?
00:37:24 <akc3n[m]> <entry1 "@rny you're right 100% if networ"> Yup, never had an issue with that, whenever I'd disable network for signal, it wouldn't not work.
00:41:16 <strcat[m]> well, I found that discussion odd
00:42:30 <strcat[m]> so, to go into why it's so odd: they just joined the room a while before they started on this
00:42:40 <strcat[m]> so, they're a new user to the room
00:43:43 <strcat[m]> they report having a strange problem that seemingly no one else has ever encountered, which is always odd when we know people have the same small set of hardware and high assurance they have unaltered firmware + entire OS, same as everyone else
00:44:33 <strcat[m]> the use of exclamation points and the fact they knew who I was based on username is a bit strange
00:45:12 <strcat[m]> so, new user, just joined the channel, but knows who this is and calls me by my first name, which is just weird for someone who doesn't know me to do in a context where I'm not using my real name
00:45:46 <strcat[m]> now, unfortunately, this channel is being consistently raided by people aiming to concern troll by pretending to be GrapheneOS users, often with the goal of pretending something is wrong or causing drama/conflict
00:45:55 <strcat[m]> sometimes it is really hard to tell
00:46:00 <strcat[m]> but this gives me pretty bad vibes
00:46:21 <strcat[m]> someone pinged me in PM about it because it gave them bad vibes and that was before certain things like calling me by my irl first name
00:46:40 <strcat[m]> as a new user to the channel who as far as I know hasn't ever interacted with me and has little reason to call me that
00:46:54 <entry1> <strcat[m] "the use of exclamation points an"> Yeah exactly, I was in this room like a dipshit for 2 months not knowing who you were. Very low chance of a true new user. I'm glad you give everyone the benefit of the doubt initially.
00:47:24 <snooopy> I needed two/three weeks to find out who strcat[m] is. :')
00:47:34 <strcat[m]> and I wanted them to use Auditor because it would check if they are really using GrapheneOS + if there is a device manager / accessibility service
00:47:44 <strcat[m]> didn't seem to go anywhere? no questions about how to use it etc.
00:47:48 <strcat[m]> it was step 1 to do
00:48:05 <rosie> Is your IRL  identity supposed to be a secret?  I figured it out pretty quickly the first time I logged in here.  Maybe I'm just more intuitive than most?  I dunno.
00:48:11 <strcat[m]> and replies to my attempts to figure out what might be wrong were just strange and then they disappeared
00:48:23 <rny> could have read the logs
00:48:29 <strcat[m]> rosie: no, but someone who just joins the channel and is calling me by my irl first name is strange
00:48:49 <strcat[m]> calling someone by their real name which you have gotten somewhere else when you don't know them is just weird, no?
00:49:01 <strcat[m]> and I don't get pinged from someone saying that
00:49:28 <strcat[m]> unless someone knows me why would they me calling me that? you don't find that weird? cause I do
00:49:34 <strcat[m]> and it's just one of multiple weird, off things about it
00:49:35 <rosie> Fair point.  Even though I knew your identity right away, I've never addressed you that way, just because I was "brought up" that that's bad 'netiquette.
00:49:57 <strcat[m]> yeah I mean it is weird to call someone by their real name when you don't know them and they are using a username
00:50:01 <rny> strcat[m]: i'll start calling you by your first name after we meet for a coffee :P
00:50:08 <strcat[m]> I am certainly not meant to be at all anonymous
00:50:14 <rny> ☕
00:51:20 <rny> strcat is a great name, there's only so many unsafe C functions from the C standard library.
00:51:21 <rosie> I also tend to be a reader/researcher, so I've read a fair amount of the GOS history, as well.  But that also was what set my mind more at ease that I was making the right choice to go with GOS.
00:51:35 <strcat[m]> in my experience meeting people I've known online for a long time irl we still think of each other via online nicks and only awkwardly use real name to avoid confusing other people
00:52:01 <strcat[m]> not really at all weird, it's just the nickname you know them by
00:52:19 <entry1> Its odd no doubt, I'm in the same boat. It would be different if they approached the situation in a different manner too. It isn't like they called you by the first name in a normal way to how they were exposed to the project/room prior, and they didn't sound like they wanted to do your suggestion with any urgency.
00:52:20 <rosie> I generally try to avoid meeting people IRL that I met online.  Creeps me out a bit.
00:52:28 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "in my experience meeting people "> All good until someone else joins the conversation and gets confused
00:52:38 <strcat[m]> entry1: yeah I mean look back at it
00:52:42 <strcat[m]> entry1: from the start, it is weird
00:52:48 <strcat[m]> entry1: maybe it is really someone with a real problem
00:52:58 <strcat[m]> they were at least making it seem that way but they do not seem to want to get it resolved
00:53:15 <strcat[m]> look at the response to asking about accessibility service / device manager
00:53:34 <strcat[m]> totally possible it is a real issue
00:53:37 <strcat[m]> not leaning that way
00:54:05 <strcat[m]> feel like it's an attempt to claim something is wrong and then get reactions to use to attack the project as has happened repeatedly these past months
00:54:47 <strcat[m]> unfortunate that it happens multiple times a day so if someone does actually have something wrong they are viewed with suspicion
00:55:13 <strcat[m]> I also get contacted a lot by email by people supposedly compromised that is largely / entirely trolling or people with delusions
00:55:27 <strcat[m]> waste time looking into it, pretty much always clear they are making stuff up
00:55:49 <strcat[m]> they'll claim something in the UI is odd and that it means they are compromised and vans are following them around hacking their phone or whatever
00:55:57 <strcat[m]> it's a daily thing
00:56:01 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "they'll claim something in the U"> Dayum
00:56:04 <strcat[m]> waste so much time
00:56:15 <grapheneos_user_> Do they not have lives
00:56:27 <strcat[m]> a lot is trolling
00:56:41 <entry1> Yep, but you/we are giving them the benefit of the doubt still. You have a good approach and attitude because there can be anomalies and it is a mature mindset. It is a shame because you being very helpful and giving detailed explanations to people can cause a headache when there are trolls.
00:56:44 <nux> strcat[m]: Their goal is to waste your time. Unfortunate reality...
00:56:49 <strcat[m]> sometimes it is people who genuinely believe they are being hacked and have some really weird ideas
00:57:25 <strcat[m]> if someone had something truly interesting to support they'd have to deal with the fact that all these people have wasted my time and made me uninterested in looking at those kinds of emails seriously
00:57:58 <strcat[m]> btw our servers are under DDoS attacks again today
00:58:06 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really impact anything
00:58:23 <grapheneos_user_> Imagine trying to DDoS a datacenter
00:58:26 <strcat[m]> it doesn't even slow things down significantly
00:58:40 <grapheneos_user_> How stupid are these people
00:58:44 <strcat[m]> well OVH just diverts / mitigates most of it
00:59:08 <strcat[m]> and our web services are hardened against it, although need to adjust them into a DDoS fighting mode if necessary
00:59:18 <rny> strcat[m]: put them behind cloudflare
00:59:19 <rny> :P
00:59:23 <strcat[m]> the values aren't super strict by default to avoid causing problems for people on very slow connections or CGNAT
00:59:33 <entry1> Plus this project can get a lot of attention because it comes up as the most secure phone and people with schizophrenia can flock to it. Schizophrenia is a really big thing and I feel so bad for people who have it because they aren't trolling and they have no one to turn to. Good stuff being able to deter the DDoSing assholes
00:59:36 <strcat[m]> rny: don't need it and won't help if they know the IPs anyway
00:59:58 <strcat[m]> I might have to put nginx in front of the mail server since they're attacking the mail server now
01:00:20 <rny> well another upside is that our users benefit from cloudflare's edge to origin routing
01:00:33 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "calling someone by their real na"> Yes, very weird.
01:00:36 <rny> better latencies and potentially throughput on better internet paths
01:00:46 <rny> ovh peers are not great
01:00:51 <strcat[m]> rny: I'd rather set up multiple VPS for grapheneos.org around world and use geodns ourselves
01:00:51 <private99[m]> Hi
01:00:53 <strcat[m]> and still control it
01:01:13 <private99[m]> Hi guys. I have a problem
01:01:16 <snoopy> rny: Not sure cloudflare is a good idea for a project which tries to improve privacy
01:01:47 <strcat[m]> rny: we use round-robin DNS for releases.grapheneos.org now, can add more servers as needed
01:01:50 <rny> just using their network and nothing private is being communicated
01:01:58 <private99[m]> In my second profile I can't install apps I they downloading fdroid but when I go to install it says "app not installed"
01:02:09 <strcat[m]> private99: because you can't install an older version there
01:02:25 <strcat[m]> private99: it's an issue with F-Droid's site: they link an out-of-date version of the app as the main download, recommend reporting the issue to them
01:02:35 <private99[m]> Ahh OK
01:02:53 <strcat[m]> private99: go to the F-Droid page on their site and ignore the main F-Droid download link, instead download the most recent stable release
01:03:01 <private99[m]> Thank you
01:03:04 <private99[m]> Will try that now
01:03:36 <strcat[m]> https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_1011050.apk
01:03:55 <strcat[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/ see there, the "download f-droid" button is a generic link on every page
01:03:59 <strcat[m]> and gives you an out-of-date version
01:04:15 <strcat[m]> it's very strange that they are resistant to fixing this and I think more people need to report the issues it causes
01:04:18 <private99[m]> A secondary question. There is an app called "locker" on fdroid which after a certain amount of failing password entry's from the google lock screen it will wipe device
01:04:25 <private99[m]> Is that good to use?
01:04:33 <private99[m]> Or won't work eight grapheme
01:04:36 <private99[m]> Grapheme*
01:04:41 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean by google lock screen
01:04:51 <strcat[m]> private99: I wouldn't recommend using a device manager
01:04:55 <private99[m]> The lock screen when entering phone
01:05:00 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
01:05:06 <private99[m]> OK thanks
01:05:12 <strcat[m]> a software enforced limit doesn't add much
01:05:18 <private99[m]> Gonna check that out
01:05:31 <strcat[m]> even with a fully random 6 digit PIN you are secure against a brute force even if the attacker compromises the OS completely with exploits
01:05:38 <strcat[m]> they would have to compromise the hardened secure element
01:05:44 <strcat[m]> to brute force
01:05:53 <private99[m]> <strcat[m] "they would have to compromise th"> Ahh interesting
01:05:56 <strcat[m]> setting a software limit on attempts does very little
01:06:18 <private99[m]> That my main threat model which is someone phsically trying to enter the phone
01:06:39 <strcat[m]> yeah so, a software limit could be bypassed if they have exploited the OS
01:06:53 <strcat[m]> the hardware-based throttling is far more useful and already quickly throttles to 1 day per attempt
01:06:56 <private99[m]> In that scenario I would be better off using a secondary user profile for most things correct ?
01:07:17 <strcat[m]> the reason it's useful to use a secondary user is primarily because the Owner profile has to be unlocked after booting
01:07:19 <strcat[m]> in order to use the phone
01:07:26 <private99[m]> That hardware based throttling is based on the titan chip ?
01:07:43 <strcat[m]> private99: that part of it is, yes
01:08:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption explains it all
01:09:07 <rosie> Question about settings:  in Permitted Networks (for system updates), which selection do I need to force GOS to update only over wifi?  It's not clear to me from the Usage Guide.
01:09:22 <strcat[m]> the SoC encryption support provides hardware-bound, hardware accelerated key derivation
01:09:25 <private99[m]> Thanks appreciate it the info and help
01:09:26 <strcat[m]> that adds a short delay to each key derivation from a passphrase, etc.
01:09:27 <private99[m]> This is very good work and really appreciate the community and devs putting in their efforts into this .
01:09:27 <strcat[m]> it accomplishes little for a weak credential like a PIN
01:09:28 <strcat[m]> the Titan M provides a Weaver implementation which offers hardware enforced throttling growing with failed attempts up to 1 day per attempt delays
01:09:29 <strcat[m]> the OS takes your credential, derives key with scrypt
01:09:51 <strcat[m]> then it has ~10 or so uses of that derived key, for each one it trivially derives a new key with personalization string using sha512
01:10:07 <private99[m]> Interesting
01:10:17 <strcat[m]> one of the uses of the key is sending a derived key to Titan M as part of Weaver, and Titan M gives back a token that was randomly generated earlier
01:10:27 <strcat[m]> that token is an extra required input to derive the disk encryption keys
01:10:34 <private99[m]> So in that case would it be makes sense to put for the owner profile a alphanumeric password
01:10:39 <strcat[m]> if you don't provide correct credential-derived key to Titan M, it won't give back the token
01:10:47 <private99[m]> While secondary profile a 8 digit pin
01:10:49 <strcat[m]> and it throttles via a secure tamper resistant internal timer
01:11:00 <strcat[m]> private99: all depends on how you want to use it
01:11:05 <strcat[m]> private99: encryption is per-profile
01:11:10 <strcat[m]> owner profile also encrypts certain device-wide data
01:11:18 <private99[m]> Ahh
01:11:29 <strcat[m]> encryption is per-profile based on the profile's lock method
01:11:44 <private99[m]> Okok I was gonna do it so they would have to break into owner first and then try again to break into the secondary profile
01:11:45 <strcat[m]> if you have super sensitive data you rarely need to access, put it in a dedicated user profile with a strong passphrase and rarely unlock the profile
01:11:54 <strcat[m]> and use the 'end session' button when finished with it
01:12:03 <private99[m]> OK that's perfect
01:12:06 <strcat[m]> which clears away encryption keys from memory/hardware
01:12:08 <private99[m]> Thanks for the help and info
01:12:28 <strcat[m]> for most people, using Owner profile as main profile is fine, and if you have super sensitive data put it in a secondary profile
01:12:40 <strcat[m]> if you want to take maximum advantage of how things work you can use a secondary profile as your main one
01:12:55 <private99[m]> Yah I think IMA prefer that method
01:12:57 <strcat[m]> so then, you can boot up the device, unlock Owner profile, and create/delete new users, or use it for basic usage
01:13:00 <private99[m]> Secondary profile
01:13:02 <strcat[m]> and your main profile is still at rest
01:13:16 <strcat[m]> so, as an example, say you want to delete your main profile
01:13:19 <strcat[m]> if it's a secondary profile
01:13:26 <strcat[m]> you can delete it without unlocking it
01:13:38 <strcat[m]> from Owner
01:13:54 <strcat[m]> the only way to completely wipe Owner is via factory reset, although you could do via recovery wipe data
01:14:01 <private99[m]> Hmm
01:14:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption has a lot of info
01:14:16 <rosie> Where is the "end session" button?  Is that only for multiple profiles?
01:14:17 <strcat[m]> there is no best option or specific recommendation
01:14:23 <strcat[m]> rosie: it's only for secondary profiles
01:14:32 <strcat[m]> rosie: end session for Owner is reboot
01:14:39 <private99[m]> So in an emergency situation its possibpy to quickly delete the second pro
01:14:44 <rhclayto> Suppose you are using the owner profile, you put it into Lockdown mode, somebody gets physical possession of your phone. What do they need to do to bypass the lockscreen, & what does GrapheneOS do to make that job harder?
01:14:44 <strcat[m]> rosie: since Owner has data needed for other profiles to work, etc.
01:14:56 <rosie> So there's no way to close all running apps at once other than a reboot?
01:14:57 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
01:15:17 <strcat[m]> rosie: not clear what you mean by closing all running apps or why you want to do that
01:15:21 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem related to stuff above
01:15:38 <strcat[m]> by all apps do you mean all system components? seems to imply rebooting
01:16:17 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: lockdown simply disables secondary unlock methods, does not do what you seem to think, and 'bypass lockscreen' is not 'break encryption'
01:16:24 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: you'll need to read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption and ask a clearer question
01:16:25 <vanderPoel> is it recommended to install it on some older device from 2015 I wanted to first test run it on such
01:16:27 <vanderPoel> ?
01:16:34 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: lockdown != end session
01:16:38 <strcat[m]> different options
01:16:53 <strcat[m]> vanderPoel: no, recommended cheapest device is a Pixel 4a
01:16:59 <rhclayto> Hi strcat. I read that FAQ, & it was very informative, but my grasp of the encryption & security mechanisms of GrapheneOS are not I think good enough to map that information onto certain hypothetical scenarios.
01:17:26 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: well, going to be difficult to answer then, beyond the information that's already there
01:17:47 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: https://grapheneos.org/features and https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption is really all the info that can be provided
01:18:01 <vanderPoel> and there is any unofficial list of confirmed phone models ?
01:18:15 <strcat[m]> vanderPoel: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
01:19:19 <rhclayto> So in the scenario where the session is not ended, what is the procedure someone would use to bypass the lock? Those kinds of scenarios, what protection is offered (or lack thereof) in various states of locked/unlocked, session active/session inactive, would help general users grasp what is going on.
01:20:10 <rosie> you mentioned an end session button, and that brought up a question I had been wondering about.  With both my Samsung and Pixel 4a, there's a button that will bring up all running apps and let me switch among them.  With the Samsung, there is also a button to close all of the running apps at once.  I'm not finding a similar button on the Pixel
01:20:11 <rosie> 4a.  The end session button you referred to sounded similar, but apparently it's not.
01:20:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption covers it
01:20:28 <strcat[m]> rosie: that button doesn't close all running apps
01:20:36 <strcat[m]> the recent apps page are user-facing activities not 'running apps'
01:20:50 <strcat[m]> clearing them away doesn't mean stuff isn't running
01:21:05 <rosie> Ok, is there a way to close all of those user-facing activities at once?
01:21:06 <strcat[m]> and 'end session' is simply 'logout' rather than 'lock screen'
01:21:48 <strcat[m]> and since encryption is per-profile, it was designed to purge the encryption keys in RAM/registers
01:21:55 <strcat[m]> to put the profile fully back at rest
01:22:05 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: you're just not going to get better info than we have on the site
01:22:20 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: this isn't a medium where I can provide more detailed info than we do there, the info on the site is the best you are going to get
01:22:45 <strcat[m]> unclear what you want to be covered there that's not covered already
01:23:29 <strcat[m]> and I am aware it is quite detailed but that is necessary
01:24:02 <rhclayto> Well, I think it would be great if the GrapheneOS project gets to the point where it can afford to hire professional copywriters, because that FAQ might explain a lot to people who are already well-versed in security & encryption, but it leaves much to be desired for a more general audience.
01:24:41 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: I don't expect a general audience to end up with a technical understanding of how things work
01:24:57 <strcat[m]> the FAQ is answering how encryption is implemented
01:25:01 <strcat[m]> it is a technical answer
01:25:11 <strcat[m]> it is not giving advice on using the OS, that wasn't the question it is supposed to answer
01:25:20 <sjsndnjdejd> <strcat[m] "rosie: that button doesn't close"> “end session” doesn’t closes all but closes apps inside the session right?
01:25:24 <strcat[m]> if you want advice on how to use the OS, that's much different than a technical question
01:25:25 <rhclayto> Right, that is what that FAQ gives, a technical underartanding. What it doesn't give is an understanding of what the technical details mean for practical usage in various scenarios.
01:25:34 <strcat[m]> if you ask a technical question, you get an  technical answer
01:25:42 <strcat[m]>  * if you ask a technical question, you get a technical answer
01:25:57 <vanderPoel> ok one question,  I read it so if I don't have a google phone then graphene os is not for me ? Samsung galaxy 20
01:25:58 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: so, here's the problem: you're asking how it protects against something and what guarantees it provides, etc.
01:26:02 <strcat[m]> technical question -> technical answer
01:26:12 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: you're asking how it would be attacked, etc.
01:26:15 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "technical question -> technical "> Mind-blowing
01:26:17 <strcat[m]> you aren't asking for usage advice
01:26:18 <rhclayto> I asked for a non-technical explanation, actually. The FAQ gives a somewhat technical explanation.
01:26:33 <nux> Wow! GrapheneOS install on Pixel 5 was smooth as buttah! :P
01:26:36 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: you can't really get a non-technical explanation for a highly technical question
01:26:47 <strcat[m]> you'll need to ask a question that's not so technical then
01:26:52 <strcat[m]> don't ask how things work on a technical level?
01:27:08 <strcat[m]> if you ask a very broad, technical question
01:27:12 <strcat[m]> that is what you are going to get in response
01:27:37 <strcat[m]> if you ask a much more specific question that's not about the implementation details and how things work that's a different thing
01:27:37 <tor3nduser[m]> <strcat[m] "rhclayto: you can't really get a"> are you part of the graphene team?
01:27:49 <strcat[m]> why?
01:28:00 <tor3nduser[m]> you seem to know alot
01:28:07 <tor3nduser[m]> ..  why? lol
01:28:17 <grapheneos_user_> He's just a user
01:28:50 <tor3nduser[m]> no.. yes. ?
01:28:58 <strcat[m]> the FAQ answers "How is disk encryption implemented?"
01:29:06 <sjsndnjdejd> <tor3nduser[m] "no.. yes. ?"> yes, lead dev
01:29:10 <rosie> vanderPoel, Yes, that's correct.  The only phones supported are in that list.  If you believe that GraphenOS is the right OS for your phone, you have to get one that is supported, rather than try to make GraphenOS fit the phone you have/want.
01:29:10 <rhclayto> I asked what an entity who gains possession of your device in locked but session-active mode would have to do to get into your data. I guess you could call that 'technical', it's a matter of semantics, but in nay case it's not clearly answered in the FAQ you referenced.
01:29:26 <strcat[m]> it is clearly answered there
01:29:34 <strcat[m]> it's not the question it is answering but it does provide all that info
01:30:14 <tor3nduser[m]> <sjsndnjdejd "yes, lead dev"> shut up lol
01:30:37 <strcat[m]> and in the last paragraph it mentions apps being able to use the keystore to keep data at rest
01:30:39 * sjsndnjdejd  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wwErvcjyLjnhpVEORRRctVkZ/message.txt >
01:30:43 <grapheneos_user_> <tor3nduser[m] "shut up lol "> No he actually is
01:30:48 <strcat[m]> when logged in by locked
01:30:52 <rhclayto> If it is a question it answers by indirect inference, then it's not clearly answered to a non-expert audience.
01:30:59 <strcat[m]>  * when logged in but locked
01:31:04 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: it answers the question
01:31:35 <tor3nduser[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "No he actually is"> daniel micay?..
01:32:08 <tor3nduser[m]> lol no.
01:32:16 <rosie> Here we go again?
01:32:29 <grapheneos_user_> This debate could not come at a better time
01:32:46 <grapheneos_user_> Or at least a more coincidental time
01:32:57 <tor3nduser[m]> strcat is daniel micay ?..
01:33:02 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: do you understand what it means by data being at rest?
01:33:16 <grapheneos_user_> <tor3nduser[m] "strcat is daniel micay ?.."> Yes
01:33:33 <rhclayto> You guys need a PR department. I mean, insisting that everything is already explained well-enough, in the face of users who say it's not, is just really bad communication.
01:33:57 <rhclayto> No, I actually don't understand that or the implications of it.
01:33:57 <rny> rhclayto: #grapheneos is not a business
01:34:12 <strcat[m]> I consider it pretty rude to suggest it is badly written rather than it being a technical answer to a technical question
01:34:22 <akc3n[m]> <rhclayto "You guys need a PR department. I"> That's your opinion. This is a nonprofit
01:34:29 <rhclayto> I know it's not a business, but I assume it has a desire to spread its goodness to a wide audience? or just a small insider's group?
01:34:34 <strcat[m]> if you think that I cannot write documentation and explanations that are non-technical you couldn't be more wrong
01:34:41 <rny> akc3n[m]: not even, its just an open source project with loosely coordinated developers
01:34:44 <rny> :P
01:34:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d​eadlypayload> looking for someone to help me make GrapheneOS rom changes. BTC Reward available.
01:35:02 <rny> with a lead developer taht goes above and beyond to write excellent technical documentation
01:35:05 <strcat[m]> I find it pretty rude implying that the docs there are badly written
01:35:12 <rny> only to have users ignore what is being written
01:35:18 <rny> 😢
01:35:19 <strcat[m]> the question it is answering is how encryption is implemented
01:35:22 <tor3nduser[m]> i didnt see a problem with any of the documents.
01:35:22 <akc3n[m]> rhclayto: and the docs are very well written. I used to have a hard time with them at first, but like anything else in life, applying yourself and learning about what everything means...
01:35:24 <strcat[m]> not "what end users should know about encryption"
01:35:34 <strcat[m]> that's a different question
01:35:36 <tor3nduser[m]> pretty straight forward to me.
01:35:57 <strcat[m]> type of answer varies based on the question
01:36:22 <strcat[m]> you ask how stuff is implemented and how it would be attacked? that's going to inherently be a pretty technical and nuanced answer to a very broad question like that focused on technical details
01:36:49 <strcat[m]> I'm not going to give an inaccurate answer or oversimplication so ask a simpler / more specific question if you want a simpler answer
01:37:08 <strcat[m]> do you understand what it means for data to be at rest?
01:39:55 <akc3n[m]> * rhclayto: and the docs are very well written. I used to have a hard time with some technical wording at first, but like anything else in life, applying yourself and learning about what everything means...
01:39:57 <rhclayto> My goodness, you guys take this stuff personal, don't you? I actually asked a specific question, you referred me to a FAQ that does not answer that specific question, you say the answer to it can be inferrred from what is written there, I say I don't feel competent to make that inference, you say 'well, there's nothing that can be done, the documentation is as good as you're going to get', & that it's rude to question the quality of the
01:39:57 <rhclayto> documentation. It may be great documentation, for a certain audeince, but completely unhelpful to another. That is what professional copywriters do, write for their audience. it's not an insult to hope for you guys that you can hire the right people to do that job. Grow up.
01:40:21 <nux> rosie: So I'm interested to try the Web interface installer at some point, based on your comments. I think it's also interesting that you flashed a phone with a phone! :)
01:42:39 <th0mcat> <nux "rosie: So I'm interested to try "> Flashed a Pixel 3 XL a couple hours ago via the web installer.  It literally couldn't be simplier
01:42:50 <rhclayto> So nevermind.
01:42:53 <grapheneos_user_> <nux "rosie: So I'm interested to try "> Well, a smartphone is a computer after all...
01:43:16 <nux> th0mcat: Yeah, they've got it dialed in pretty well.
01:43:30 <nux> grapheneos_user_: Really? ;)
01:43:30 <grapheneos_user_> <rhclayto "documentation. It may be great d"> Chill
01:43:34 <tor3nduser[m]> <rhclayto "So nevermind."> i agree
01:43:36 <strcat[m]> rhclayto: doesn't really seem you want a question answered
01:44:28 <nux> th0mcat: I haven't tried the Web installer yet but I think I will try it on my next load.
01:44:37 <tor3nduser[m]> you know if you are really the lead dev on graphene. more power to ya really.  you guys do a great job. but my god being nicer would be cool
01:44:46 <rhclayto> No, you just can't answer it. And so . . . much . . ego.
01:45:24 <nux> th0mcat: I just used the CLI method on a brand new Pixel5 and it was very easy.
01:45:30 <rosie> @nux  the documentation does state that you can use one phone's browser to flash another phone using the Web installer, but I had initially interpreted that to mean a phone that already had GOS installed.  I would never have thought of it if one of the mods here hadn't suggested it, and by golly, it worked!
01:45:36 <grapheneos_user_> rhclayto: if you want a basic high level explanation
01:45:55 <nux> rosie: That's pretty cool!
01:47:19 <nux> th0mcat: rosie: Now I just need to wait for my Pixel 4a to backup to my Nextcloud instance so that I can import everything over to the Pixel 5.
01:47:46 <entry1> <rhclayto "So nevermind."> I think you went about this the wrong way and telling the lead developer to grow up isn't very kind. A more suitable question would be "Is there a difference with GrapheneOS data at rest (before unlock) and after first unlock, and are there any known vulnerabilities for companies like Cellebrite (who work with law enforcement) to unlock a GrapheneOS device.
01:47:57 <grapheneos_user_> <entry1 "I think you went about this the "> He's banned
01:48:00 <entry1> Nvm, sorry you're getting attacked today
01:48:13 <entry1> <grapheneos_user_ "He's banned"> Yep lol
01:48:16 <strcat[m]> think those are the same person and not acting in good faith
01:48:21 <grapheneos_user_> <entry1 "Yep lol"> Hehe
01:48:29 <grapheneos_user_> :P
01:48:36 <th0mcat> Yeah that was super concern-trolly
01:49:12 <strcat[m]> again, some very weird stuff going on there
01:49:14 <strcat[m]> similar to earlier
01:49:17 <strcat[m]> hope people can see that
01:49:17 <grapheneos_user_> How is strcat supposed to write non technical documentation for a technical answer
01:49:24 <grapheneos_user_> Makes no sense whatsoever
01:49:34 <strcat[m]> I wrote nearly all the docs on the site and there are plenty of non-technical docs there
01:50:04 <grapheneos_user_> * How is strcat supposed to write non technical answers for a technical question
01:50:11 <strcat[m]> don't appreciate someone claiming that I'm not capable of writing good documentation and teaching people things in a way they can understand
01:50:19 <entry1> He was in here yesterday and name dropped JollyRoger, but that could have been a way to seem innocent. For anyone reading the logs or who hasn't seen what was deleted, he insulted the lead developer who was trying to assist him kindly and insulted him again. Another user joined in together.
01:50:30 <strcat[m]> you can see I asked several times if they knew what at rest meant and was fully willing to explain it in detail
01:50:42 <grapheneos_user_> Wow
01:50:44 <strcat[m]> they wouldn't respond
01:50:49 <strcat[m]> entry1: who was?
01:51:05 <strcat[m]> yesterday I mean
01:51:13 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "they wouldn't respond"> "that answer can't stop me because I can't read!"
01:51:29 <grapheneos_user_> What it seems like
01:51:31 <entry1> Yes, you did strcat. Completely justified. strcat rhclayto
01:51:41 <strcat[m]> can explain what exactly happened yesterday?
01:52:14 <strcat[m]> there have been raids on the channel in the past few days, as expected
01:52:43 <entry1> He was in here and said he was referred by PeterEaston to the room. It seemed innocent enough and he could have been lying 100%
01:53:00 <strcat[m]> entry1: doesn't really seem problematic?
01:53:02 <entry1> We pointed him to the OT room as well.
01:53:38 <entry1> Trying to think exactly what he asked. No, he seemed innocent enough but today he acted very hostile towards you.
01:53:47 <sphinx[m]> <strcat[m] "you can see I asked several time"> > rhclayto
01:54:10 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> tf is going on
01:54:19 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "hope people can see that"> Ya I've been catching on to patterns lately, and thanks for laying out how they operate.
01:56:28 <strcat[m]> sphinx: and I was going to explain it in detail to them and they kept insulting my writing instead and implying I need to hire someone to write for me
01:56:32 <strcat[m]> which is actually pretty insulting
01:56:43 <strcat[m]> and by the way I got involved in open source initially by writing documentation
01:57:44 <linuxwolf[m]> would installing stock android aosp on a second device provide any type of security or is it pretty open?
01:57:58 <strcat[m]> linuxwolf: there are no official AOSP releases as a whole OS
01:58:09 <strcat[m]> unclear what you mean by 'stock android aosp'
01:58:22 <strcat[m]> stock is used to refer to what comes on the device from retail / factory
01:58:47 <strcat[m]> AOSP is the open source OS forked by vendors and others to make stock OSes and alternate OSes for the devices
01:58:51 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't have releases itself
01:59:02 <strcat[m]>  * AOSP doesn't have releases with builds itself
01:59:05 <strcat[m]> it has source code releases
01:59:37 <linuxwolf[m]> i guess i meant if you download and build aosp fro. source
01:59:41 <linuxwolf[m]> from*
02:00:18 <linuxwolf[m]> <strcat[m] "stock is used to refer to what c"> yea true lol.    i just meant nothing done to it
02:00:43 <strcat[m]> AOSP requires device support code to be added
02:00:55 <linuxwolf[m]> ah i see
02:00:55 <strcat[m]> so, you'll need to clarify more what you're trying to do
02:01:09 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> <strcat[m] "and by the way I got involved in"> archwiki administrator 0 0
02:01:12 <strcat[m]> you can't simply build AOSP for a device, you need to add the device support code for it
02:01:34 <strcat[m]> yeah I got involved in editing the Arch Linux wiki and was an administrator there
02:01:38 <strcat[m]> and I wrote a lot of the content on it
02:01:55 <linuxwolf[m]> im not trying to do anything. i just wanted to know if any security is implemented in it for my old pix 3a
02:02:01 <strcat[m]> including a lot of the install guide, etc.
02:02:06 <strcat[m]> and I've written a lot of other docs
02:02:07 <linuxwolf[m]> ah ok. i may check that out
02:02:16 <strcat[m]> some highly technical, some fairly technical, some not very technical at all
02:02:33 <strcat[m]> FAQ answers vary in how they address it based on the question
02:02:35 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "and I wrote a lot of the content"> That's pretty sweet... Never knew that, thanks! I'm on their lots.
02:02:54 <linuxwolf[m]> yea really. arch wiki is awesome 😆
02:03:07 <strcat[m]> the one about how encryption is implemented is meant to be a technical answer, avoiding saying things requiring being a developer to understand, but assuming background in understanding encryption
02:03:24 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to explain how disk encryption or key derivation work as concepts
02:03:36 <strcat[m]> it's meant to be an answer for people who want the technical details and understand those topics
02:03:47 <strcat[m]> if you don't want technical details, that isn't a question/answer for you
02:03:54 <strcat[m]> if you want advice on how to use the OS, that's not meant for that
02:03:57 <linuxwolf[m]> what documentation are you referring to?
02:04:40 <strcat[m]> I'm referring to the fact that I don't appreciate someone trying to imply that I'm bad at writing and need to hire 'professional copywriters' because they don't like the answer I gave to their question
02:04:53 <entry1> <akc3n[m] "That's pretty sweet... Never kne"> Always learn something new everyday in here. Dude is a walking book of knowledge and releases everything to the world for free and open source. Needs a book written on him, but an autobiography would be the best tbh because another author would mess it up 😂
02:05:28 <strcat[m]> that section is supposed to be technical and requires knowing encryption terms
02:05:32 <nux> Is there a GrapheneOS forum where one may post devices installed with GOS for sale? I'd list my Pixel 4a on Gazelle or Swappa but I suspect it wouldn't appeal to the average security-unconcious person with GrapheneOS running on it.
02:05:34 <strcat[m]> that's the point of it
02:06:07 <strcat[m]> it's actually quite frustrating putting so much effort into writing that stuff and then having that response to it
02:06:37 <strcat[m]> and once I put substantial effort into making content there I want to use it as an answer, that was the point of writing it
02:07:14 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications here's an example of a section that's meant to get across a lot of non-technical info while providing technical details as a bonus
02:07:34 <strcat[m]> but that encryption section is literally "how is encryption implemented?"
02:07:51 <strcat[m]> which from my interpretation what was basically what they were asking here: how is it implemented and how would it be attacked
02:07:56 <nux> Probably best just to re-flash it back to Google's OS and sell it that way but figured I'd ask.
02:08:08 <entry1> <strcat[m] "it's actually quite frustrating "> You're not falling on 100% deaf ears, I can assure you that. Can't imagine your pain when you're the epitome of a "good" person trying to better the world
02:08:13 <linuxwolf[m]> <strcat[m] "it's actually quite frustrating "> idk i think you guys did a good job.   i understand the documentation on the website..
02:08:19 <strcat[m]> I could make another encryption section about more specific things
02:08:23 <strcat[m]> I wanted to make one about the keystore
02:08:29 <strcat[m]> I do not really want to make one with 'advice'
02:08:38 <strcat[m]> because there is no one size fits all advice
02:08:49 <strcat[m]> what I can do is explain how things work, like that section
02:08:57 <strcat[m]> or provide a section on advantages/disadvantages to different approaches
02:09:06 <strcat[m]> people ultimately have to choose what's best for their needs
02:09:16 <strcat[m]> there can be more info on encryption there
02:09:26 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "I could make *another* encryptio"> Do you think you would do that then? I would love to learn from it.
02:09:37 <akc3n[m]> As I'm sure others will too
02:09:39 <strcat[m]> maybe but not as a response to this
02:09:51 <akc3n[m]> I understand. And agree.
02:09:54 <strcat[m]> stuff like this discourages me from writing it
02:10:45 <akc3n[m]> No. Please. Your writing is amazing. And extremely beneficial to everyone and anyone who wants to learn. Please don't be discouraged by idiot trolls.
02:11:04 <strcat[m]> anyway if you read that section I think you can see I did try to make a technical answer as understandable as possible but defining terms, etc. isn't in scope
02:11:17 <nux> akc3n[m]: +1
02:11:31 <grapheneos_user_> <nux "Is there a GrapheneOS forum wher"> Off topic, will answer in that channel
02:11:50 <nux> grapheneos_user_: Oh yeah, I forgot about that channel. Thanks!
02:12:01 <strcat[m]> > All data, file names and other metadata is always stored encrypted.
02:12:05 <strcat[m]> it says that pretty early
02:12:32 <strcat[m]> anyway point of the section is not to define terms or how disk encryption works in general
02:12:52 <strcat[m]> it's specifically meant to say how it is implemented in AOSP with a modern device fully providing the hardware features for it and what GrapheneOS changes
02:13:25 <strcat[m]> it is not "what is disk encryption?" "how does disk encryption work?" etc
02:13:51 <strcat[m]> and it's not "what are the security properties of the approach to disk encryption?" either
02:14:06 <strcat[m]> that's just meant to be implied, for people who understand what it's talking about
02:14:11 <entry1> The advantages and disadvantages for comparisons in opsec would be huge to read, but again you have a lot on your plate already. You could write a book(s) about the operating system and underlying security features and enhancements and I'd want to read every page. You always remain as impartial as possible, but most laypeople want "absolutes" and ultimately your opinion (even though you always specify their isn't a one
02:14:11 <entry1> size fits all approach and that it can get too technical). The website is an amazing tool and when people have questions, I always try to link it directly since it answers them better and can answer a ton of other questions that will arise.
02:14:43 <strcat[m]> yes people want overly simple answers to a very broad a nuanced question
02:15:13 <strcat[m]> if you ask a question about the security properties and how it could be attacked you really need to start by understanding that section
02:15:13 <strcat[m]> and go from there
02:15:22 <strcat[m]> otherwise I could make an overly simplified take on it
02:15:55 <strcat[m]> and I can't read minds, I can't know if someone really just wants some simple reassurance or basic explanation
02:16:03 <strcat[m]> if they ask how it works I take that as what it means
02:16:35 <strcat[m]> > GrapheneOS enables support for ending secondary user profile sessions after logging into them. It adds an end session button to the lockscreen and in the global action menu accessed by holding the power button. This fully purges the encryption keys and puts the profiles back at rest. This can't be done for the owner profile without rebooting due to it encrypting the sensitive system-wide operating system data.
02:16:54 <strcat[m]> > Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device. Even if you use the same passphrase for multiple profiles, each of those profiles still ends up with a unique key encryption key and a compromise of the OS while one of them is active won't leak the passphrase. The
02:16:54 <strcat[m]> advantage to using separate passphrases is in case an attacker records you entering it.
02:17:11 <strcat[m]> I think this is a really good explanation
02:17:16 <strcat[m]> I don't understand what is wrong with it
02:17:27 <linuxwolf[m]> question.  what is meant by "user facing" firewall.
02:17:41 <strcat[m]> linuxwolf: toggles, knobs, frills for end users to change
02:17:50 <linuxwolf[m]> ah. thanks
02:17:50 <entry1> Exactly, and you can open a can of worms because you are so often quoted. If there is misinterpretation of the person's question and an oversimplified answer given, it could lead to other people being confused and even more questions.
02:18:25 <strcat[m]> a lot of care went into writing stuff in a way that it doesn't get misinterpreted and I edit it if that's happening
02:18:35 <strcat[m]> it has to be nuanced and detailed sometimes
02:19:00 <strcat[m]> someone having your device while a profile is logged in doesn't mean they inherently get data from it
02:19:06 <strcat[m]> they would have to exploit the OS
02:19:16 <strcat[m]> and as it explains in the final paragraph apps can keep data at rest when locked
02:19:17 <strcat[m]> using keystore
02:19:46 <strcat[m]> imo those 2 paragraphs are a good answer and a lot of information beyond what they explicitly state is implied by them
02:21:02 <strcat[m]> there could be a separate question about that kind of thing but it's not going to be what people want since it's all going to have to be nuanced and detailed in the same way
02:21:30 <strcat[m]> profile logged in means the OS has access to most of that profile's data
02:21:59 <strcat[m]> not all, particularly when locked, but most, and it's up to apps to use keystore
02:22:44 <linuxwolf[m]> any plans to implement the ability to utilize the pixel 5s adaptive charging feature?
02:22:50 <strcat[m]> so, sorry for not putting misleading or dishonest marketing BS / claims on the site like nearly anyone else...
02:23:08 <strcat[m]> linuxwolf: all the normal charging stuff works fine
02:23:22 <strcat[m]> linuxwolf: no plans to implement machine learning of your habits to adjust things like brightness, charging, etc.
02:24:17 <linuxwolf[m]> i was referring to the feature where if an alarm is set then the phone will charge slower throughout that time period to reach 100% just prior to the alarm going off
02:24:33 <linuxwolf[m]> i think they call it adaptive charging
02:24:52 <rny> why'd this be something controlled by the clock app?
02:25:02 <rny> its the battery controllers job to decide how many amps to pull from the charger
02:27:10 <entry1> Thank you for being a good person. I seriously hope you don't get too overburdened with the constant trolling/attacks to just stop what you're doing overall and become probably one of the best blackhat hackers there could possibly be. You deserve more resources and help than you get.
02:33:04 <strcat[m]> linuxwolf: which uses machine learning type stuff
02:33:14 <strcat[m]> linuxwolf: and also what happens if you need to get up early and your phone is half charged
02:33:48 <strcat[m]> we have all the standard charging throttling stuff based on heat, capacity, etc.
02:33:57 <rny> 🙃
02:33:58 <strcat[m]> charges slower near max capacity, avoids making it too hot, etc.
02:34:05 <strcat[m]> standard USB-PD stuff integrated into SoC + battery
02:34:10 <strcat[m]> very sophisticated already
02:34:29 <rny> ML coerces people into 16/8 day-night cycles
02:34:31 <rny> :P
02:39:33 <linuxwolf[m]> <strcat[m] "we have all the standard chargin"> thats good to know.  i just noticed yesterday that my phone said it was rapid charging.
02:39:44 <linuxwolf[m]> which led me to look for a way to turn off rapid charge
03:25:26 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> Hi, recently I've been noticing from a certain update some apps are not adjusted to System Language. I have Japanese language set on my phone, it used to be that the software downloaded would correctly show Japanese but now they all revert to English for some reason. Noticable apps are Google Maps, Google Photos, Deezer, Shazam and many more. I would appreciate if anyone knew what went wrong. Thanks a lot
03:26:26 <TheJollyRoger> entry1: ah, crap, looks like I got back a little late. He appeared on my github asking me some questions. Some I answered, but a few I didn't exactly feel qualified to answer so I just linked the FAQ and the IRC channel. Nevermind that though, if he's been disrespectful, that has noplace here.
03:27:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ah well. In the future, I might take my old drafts down because they're only up there for historical preservation, they're not curated.
03:28:58 <TheJollyRoger> For the record, the existing documentation's much better than what I could do, with my understanding of the operating system at this point in time. I'm not sure I could break it down much further without it starting to sound condescending...

05:09:27 <hopethisisuniq> I'm running into an issue and before I submit a bug report I thought I'd ask here if anyone else has encountered this:
05:09:28 <hopethisisuniq> I installed Signal (through Aurora Store) and went through the setup and registration, including restoring messages from a backup, but within a few seconds after that the app closed suddenly. Now when I try to open it it will open to a white screen (for about a quarter of a second) and then close. In my notifications bar it tells me that Signal has
05:09:28 <hopethisisuniq> a background connection enabled. I've tried force stopping it and rebooting the phone to no success.
05:09:37 <hopethisisuniq> This is my third time trying to set up the app. I did the same thing yesterday with the same problem. I then uninstalled Signal and reinstalled it but did not restore from a backup. But because I want my old messages I then tried setting it up again today and once again restoring from a backup. Anyone have any thoughts? Or should I just submit a
05:09:37 <hopethisisuniq> bug report? Thank you.
05:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> Hello hopethisisuniq, I'm running the latest of Signal, haven't seen what you're seeing. If you have access to the developer options, you can capture and send a tombstone.
05:11:21 <hopethisisuniq> OK I'll do that
05:12:20 <hopethisisuniq> Hmmm this is happening on a secondary user account so maybe I can't activate developer options?
05:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, haven't had any problems with Signal on a secondary user account either.
05:13:48 <hopethisisuniq> I more meant that I can't seem to activate developer options from within a secondary account. I'll try to replicate this in the phone's owner account
05:14:43 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
05:50:41 <ihopethisisuniq> Hmmm... reinstalled and registered signal on my owner account and now it isn't crashing. I'll try to figure out how to replicate the problem but if I guess I'll try reinstalling it on the secondary account where I was running into the issues.
05:51:03 <ihopethisisuniq> *if I can't replicate the crashes
06:00:18 <ihopethisisuniq> OK now it's crashing again and I tried to capture a bug report but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right:
06:00:18 <ihopethisisuniq> I went to Developer options and clicked on Bug report. I then opened signal to replicate the issue and then clicked on Details under the bug report notification. I gave it a title and summary and clicked Save and then chose to share it. And then it went to a blank screen. Am I doing this right?

15:29:10 <mrx777[m]> Hello guys
15:33:34 <Stephen[m]> Sup
15:43:31 <Babe69> https://www.ebay.com/itm/333952068836
15:46:14 <cacheline> I'm interested in GrapheneOS for my personal device. But, I'm wondering if there's an easy way to figure out which of my apps do NOT use the Play Services library.  Are there any ways to determine this without first trying to install & use the app?
15:46:14 <cacheline> Also, since Project Treble is using play services to distribute OS updates, as far as I understand it, how does that work for OS updates for GrapheneOS?
15:46:15 <cacheline> And as an Android app dev, would I need to skip using a lot of the AndroidX libraries and such in order for apps to work on GrapheneOS?  Or is it strictly things like maps, gms, and other play-* maven artifacts that won't work in GrapheneOS?
15:46:45 <cacheline> Is there an easy way to install GrapheneOS on the standard emulator bundled with Android Studio, so I can test it out?
15:53:53 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> who here uses signal with grapheme?
15:54:51 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> no matter what I do I can't get it to vibrate or ring when someone texts or calls. its permanently stuck on silent. how do I get it off silent?
15:55:33 <cacheline> I haven't tried it, but have you gone to the Settings app to the Signal settings, and adjusted the notification channel settings there?
15:55:59 <Stephen[m]> <cacheline "I haven't tried it, but have you"> Yes, I would check this
15:56:48 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> its under settings accounts then signal?
15:58:08 <cacheline> Long press on the Signal icon and choose the app info option (may look like an "i" in a circle)... then click Notifications
15:58:44 <cacheline> Will look approximately like this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zpwUb.jpg
15:59:18 <cacheline> The UI tends to change slightly across Android releases, so it may look somewhat different.
15:59:29 <Stephen[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "its under settings accounts then"> Settings>apps and notifications> notifications
16:01:11 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> it's turned on
16:01:29 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> but still stuck on silent
16:02:29 <Stephen[m]> Are you getting a notification for background connection enabled on signal?
16:02:31 <cacheline> Well, it's more than just turned on.  In Android 8, they added "notification channels", so apps could have different settings for various types of notifications (vibrate, sound, blinking led, etc).  You need to adjust all the settings for the notification channel in question
16:02:38 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> yea I am
16:02:51 <akc3n[m]> <cacheline "Is there an easy way to install "> Have you checked the build page on Grapheneos.org?
16:02:54 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> it's there but its not showing right now
16:03:17 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> how do you turn it on?
16:04:31 <Stephen[m]> Mine just shows up when the signal background service is running
16:04:59 <Stephen[m]> You could try force stopping, then open the app, see if that does anything
16:05:00 <cacheline> akc3n[m] not as of yet.  So, I'll need to build for an emulator target?
16:08:11 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I restarted my phone now it shows up
16:08:49 <akc3n[m]> <cacheline "akc3n not as of yet.  So, I'll n"> Please read https://grapheneos.org/build it has all the information
16:08:54 <cacheline> Another thought occurs to me: since GrapheneOS doesn't have the Play Store, how can I obtain an app if it's not on F-Droid?  Do I have to hope the devs published an APK somewhere that I can sideload?
16:09:46 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I use apkpure
16:12:18 <Stephen[m]> Also the Aurora Store is a good opt
16:13:11 <Stephen[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "I use apkpure"> Might want to double check those apks b4 u install
16:13:49 <cacheline> Interesting.  Seems to have a few apps I use just from a basic perusal.  I even see my company's app there.  So, super curious, how do they do it?  Do they just manage to scrape the Play Store? (Not upset about it, genuinely curious)
16:14:43 <tony_l[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "I use apkpure"> apkmirror publishes hash and cert fingerprint
16:15:09 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> signal still won't allow me to get notifications
16:15:34 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> the message shows up butnit won't vibrate or ring. its stuck on silent

17:47:44 <bikeman1234[m]> Hi! I have a pixel 5 and a Pixel 4a with GrapheneOS, on both i experience some problems with SMS, but only in alternative profiles not the owner profile.  Sometimes I get a notification about SMS but i cant find the SMS, i know there should be one as I have tried texting myself. This happens almost everyday and it works again when i restart the phone, at all times the notifications only vibrates no sound even if
17:47:44 <bikeman1234[m]> the settings say it should make sound and the volume is max
17:47:58 <bikeman1234[m]> Owner profile no problems
17:52:00 <southron[m]> With the default messaging app I always receive SMS but it vibrates only in user profile.  The only time I received no notification was with 3rd party SMS apps.
17:52:24 <bikeman1234[m]> I have the default one
17:53:11 <southron[m]> The built in app is pretty ancient. Maybe it doesn't fully support user profiles or there is a setting I haven't figured out.
17:55:32 <bikeman1234[m]> I want to use signal as SMS app but it seems it cant be signed in on multiple profiles
17:58:40 <kepoff[m]> <bikeman1234[m] "I want to use signal as SMS app "> you could use something like Molly for this, which is basically hardened Signal
17:59:02 <kepoff[m]> But it might be better to ask this on the off topic channel:  #grapheneos:matrix.org
17:59:19 <bikeman1234[m]> ok

18:01:39 <odinos[m]> For the license of a paid app I need to have a certain email address registered in my OS
18:01:47 <odinos[m]> How do I accomplish this without a native email app?
18:02:33 <odinos[m]> "The Pro version will only work on Android devices where this email is registered as an Android account." it says on the paypal payment page
18:52:06 <entry1> <odinos[m] "For the license of a paid app I "> There isn't an email exactly registered in an OS. You can just have access to the email?
18:52:44 <entry1> Unlike a Google account signed in or an iOS email
18:57:10 <odinos[m]> I dont understand
18:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> odinos[m]: don't quote me on this, but if I recall correctly, paid apps are handled via Play Services. Some aspects of play services are privacy invasive and need to be deeply integrated into the operating system in order to function, so GrapheneOS does not bundle them.
18:59:20 <TheJollyRoger> In other words, the device needs to be linked to a Google account.
18:59:51 <odinos[m]> No this licensing method was specifically made for people without play services
19:00:32 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, you'll have to take it up with upstream directly, then.
19:00:49 <odinos[m]> https://yatse.tv/yatse-payment-troubleshooting
19:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you'll have to take it up with them, then.
19:01:16 <TheJollyRoger> I can't help you with that, unfortunately.
19:01:35 <odinos[m]> Well their dev is saying to contact the rom dev
19:01:47 <odinos[m]> I just need to register an email as android account
19:01:58 <odinos[m]> youre saying this is not possible? regardless of the licensing thing
19:03:43 <odinos[m]> https://community.yatse.tv/t/license-without-google-services/2270/10
19:03:48 <TheJollyRoger> Well, under settings that's handled by the app.
19:04:42 <odinos[m]> When I press add account in OS settings there is no option to enter an email
19:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That should be handled by the app.
19:04:56 <odinos[m]> what app
19:05:06 <TheJollyRoger> The app you're trying to use.
19:05:25 <TheJollyRoger> Apps like Signal, Linphone, OpenKeyChain that use account sync should populate that automatically.
19:05:57 <odinos[m]> On other roms adding an email account is handled by a default mail app
19:06:19 <odinos[m]> I'm only asking how I can achieve this in GOS
19:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I think I'm out of ideas for you, someone else is going to have to step in here.
19:07:08 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry mate.
19:07:15 <odinos[m]> okay no problem
19:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm not a developer, I'm just the channel greeter)
19:07:31 <TheJollyRoger> (So ahoy!)
19:08:16 <sizzyb> greetings. would there be a reason that my PIN is no longer working?
19:08:23 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
19:08:27 <TheJollyRoger> Your unlock pin?
19:09:29 <sizzyb> ya. my unlock PIN isn't working. I literally unlocked it, 2 seconds later attempted to turn off Location from top pulldown menu, and it requested a PIN. I entered the same PIN to unlock the device in the first place, and it's not working
19:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> Might've mistyped it?
19:10:54 <sizzyb> I'm on my  13th attempt... have meticulously entered to ensure no extra numbers, right order, etc etc
19:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> That's all I can think of. A few people here have ended up forgetting their lock pins and having to start over again by resetting from recovery.
19:11:25 <TheJollyRoger> Dunno, there's not much of a reason this would happen.
19:11:47 <sizzyb> I have no problem doing that... it's just really weird... I'll attempt to reset & see if I can replicate the problem...
19:12:02 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. If you need to reset via recovery I'll walk you through the process.
19:13:09 <sizzyb> In the absence of an online guide, that would be incredible
19:14:17 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Alright, so... first thing first, this is the only warning you will get when doing this: if we reset your phone via recovery, there is no way back, because the security chip will shred its access tokens and generate new ones. So even if you do find the password at a later date, even if the SSD is intact, the contents can't be recovered.
19:14:31 <TheJollyRoger> So try to exhaust all other options before we try this, if there's anything you value on that phone.
19:14:49 <TheJollyRoger> There is no "oops" switch.
19:15:41 <sizzyb> Understood. Luckily only installed last week, so losing valuable info is a non-issue
19:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Ok, so the first step is, we're going to reboot to the bootloader, I want you to power off your phone via the power menu.
19:16:35 <TheJollyRoger> Once it's powered off, I want you to press and hold down the VOLUME DOWN key, then press and hold the POWER key until you see the black "Fastboot Mode" screen.
19:17:25 <TheJollyRoger> Once you get there, use VOLUME UP or VOLUME DOWN to scroll through the options until you get to "Recovery mode" Select it by tapping and releasing POWER once.
19:18:09 <TheJollyRoger> You'll see the yellowscreen "different operating system" warning (you can skip it by double tapping POWER) followed by the OEM logo, and then it'll drop you at a black screen with the Green Robot lying on its back with a "!" and "No Command."
19:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> Once you see that, I want you to do this part very quickly:
19:19:21 <TheJollyRoger> You need to quickly press and hold POWER, then tap and release VOLUME UP then let go of VOLUME UP and then let go of POWER.
19:19:56 <TheJollyRoger> You should arrive at a menu labelled: "GrapheneOS Recovery" which should have several options, "Wipe Data/Factory Reset" should be near the middle of the menu.
19:20:42 <TheJollyRoger> This should get you back to a fresh start of GrapheneOS.
19:23:47 <sizzyb> Ahoy! Thanks TheJollyRoger
19:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, hope this helps!
19:41:10 <sizzyb> I couldn't replicate the issue, but I believe last boot I didn't allow apps access to location at all. This boot I allowed location upon permission

19:52:58 <osm2lis> I don't think so. How do I do that?

20:02:22 <chile09[m]> Hello
20:04:47 <chile09[m]> Is it possible to install GrapheneOS on a nexus 6P
20:05:00 <jpds> chile09[m]: No, the supported devices are on the website
20:06:12 <chile09[m]> So it's just the Google Pixel models?
20:06:33 <jpds> chile09[m]:  Yep
20:08:47 <chile09[m]> Is there something which prevents GrapheneOS from being ported to a different device?
20:10:19 <tony_l[m]> <chile09[m] "Is there something which prevent"> rtfm
20:10:47 <skwisgaar[m]> chile09: the security/privacy goals of GrapheneOS only can be accomplished on Pixel devices at this point in time. You could port it but it wouldn’t be the same.

21:55:04 <helloworldkk87[m> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Spektrum_light> Hello all; I'm "> Not in my opinion. And if you think GrapheneOS is just de-googled phone you are missing 95% of the point. GrapheneOS is to protect you from memory corruption vulnerabilities and software exploits, and contain apps you've installed on your device and prevent them from exploiting your operating system. And alot the security is tied to the hardware and only Pixels
21:55:04 <helloworldkk87[m> have it right now
21:55:27 <helloworldkk87[m> Just my opinion tho
21:55:33 <snoopy> failbetter[m]: It may be possible, but there need to be someone who puts time and effort in it to make it reality
21:55:49 <jcenny[m]> snoopy: yes, not all apps are behaving like the com.sella.bancasella. I'm trying to understand why that app is crashing.
21:56:27 <snoopy> jcenny[m]: Maybe the app got an update?
21:56:36 <jcenny[m]> nope, same version
21:56:41 <snoopy> And crashes if it doesn't find a stock android with google? :x
21:56:46 <jcenny[m]> working before grapheneos upgrade
21:57:12 <jcenny[m]> it was complaining about google services missing, but it was working fine

21:59:09 <jcenny[m]> this: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25060 is a very similar error
22:00:16 <snoopy> I assume the app isn't open source?
22:00:38 <jcenny[m]> Yes, that's not opensource
22:02:57 <snoopy> I don't see much changes in the update, not sure what could've happened here
22:06:50 <jcenny[m]> could a full crash log help in finding the problem?

22:37:47 <private99[m]> Got a question. I run graphene with mullvad VPN always on and DNS is the mullvad adblock server.
22:37:48 <private99[m]> I want to install one of those VoIP apps like textme or textfree from the aurora store . however I noticed it has a lot of trackers on it. If I download it is the app sandboxed or will it be able to report and track what I do across graphene os and websites I visit
22:37:48 <private99[m]> What information about the phone will it have  other than phone model? Will it have android I'd ?
22:51:38 <arcibald[m]> Hello. Is there any open source / trusted MDM for pixels with graphenos on them?
23:24:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hello private99[m], apps are always sandboxed, and with respect to "trackers" on Aurora store,
23:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> arcibald[m]: There aren't. We recommend against third party device administrators, they present a lot of attack surface
23:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> private99[m]: with respect to trackers on Aurora Store, something you ought to know is that just because an app includes a library such as firebase, that's not actually a sign of it being invasive or not. It's actually at the discretion of the app developers to use the librariesand what for.
23:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> Consequently, them merely being included is not a "smoking gun" of the app being invasive, nor is the lack of them an indication that the app is trustworthy.
23:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> Because it's up to the app developers to determine how they are used and what they do.
23:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> private99[m]: apps on GrapheneOS are always sandboxed, all the time, and this cannot be turned off nor disabled by you. Apps are only able to see what data you permit them to see, and they can only enumerate other apps within their own respective profile.
23:29:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sandboxing cannot be disabled by you, nor can apps "opt out" of it. Similarly, interprocess communication (which is limited to apps in the same profile) is a two-way street: even if an app was written by the NSA that whitelisted every other app in the world for interprocess communication, that wouldn't count for anything unless all the other app authors that they wanted to communicate with
23:29:52 <TheJollyRoger> became complicit.

23:53:06 <backupaccmovedto> btw why the hardened malloc?
23:53:06 <backupaccmovedto> what is the issue with the original one?
23:53:06 <jj1013[m]> <vata0[m] "Felix: pretty sure there’s a pos"> Sure thing.
23:53:23 <strcat[m]> backup acc; moved to @java:furry.lol: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/README.md
23:53:32 <chile09[m]> is LineageOS any good?
23:53:42 <vata0[m]> I thought y’all was friendly with calyx
23:53:48 <backupaccmovedto> <chile09[m] "is LineageOS any good?"> i like it a lot
23:54:03 <vata0[m]> I’ve never heard them say anything bad and I’m in there a lot
23:54:16 <Felix[m]4> <vata0[m] "Felix: pretty sure there’s a pos"> Alright, I'll check it out
23:54:29 <chile09[m]> <backupaccmovedto "i like it a lot"> The security isn't as good as graphene obviously
23:54:37 <backupaccmovedto> true
23:54:42 <backupaccmovedto> it has more user freedom
23:54:44 <backupaccmovedto> you can root it
23:54:50 <backupaccmovedto> and microg is available
23:54:54 <jj1013[m]> <chile09[m] "is LineageOS any good?"> It may be FLOSS, but it is a really big downgrade on security due to it depending on an always-unlocked bootloader.
23:54:57 <Felix[m]4> <chile09[m] "is LineageOS any good?"> Really good privacy but not as secure
23:55:07 <Superstig[m]> Depends on what you want to do with your Android ROM.
23:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hi guys, Lineage isn't topical to GrapheneOS, but I'll entertain this one.
23:55:21 <kradav[m]> <jj1013[m] "It may be FLOSS, but it is a rea"> it can work with locked bl
23:55:25 <jj1013[m]> <backupaccmovedto "you can root it"> microG is not even near deGoogled.
23:55:31 <backupaccmovedto> <jj1013[m] "microG is not even near deGoogle"> im aware
23:55:41 <jj1013[m]> Also, root is also a security downgrade.
23:55:41 <backupaccmovedto> but its useful
23:55:41 <backupaccmovedto> i
23:55:42 <backupaccmovedto>  * but its useful
23:55:43 <Superstig[m]> LineageOS trades user freedom for security.
23:55:49 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to the old security and privacy debate, I'll put it this way: Privacy is a byproduct of security, and security is a prerequisite for privacy.
23:55:51 <Superstig[m]> Just depends on what you want.
23:55:54 <backupaccmovedto> i dont think it should be in there by default
23:55:54 <backupaccmovedto> but the posibility to install it
23:55:56 <exifran[m]> <backupaccmovedto "but its useful"> Not really
23:56:07 <TheJollyRoger> That's our philosophy; GrapheneOS and LineageOS are very different projects, and are intended for two very very different audiences.
23:56:58 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to play System Administrator or Power User with your phone, be my guest on Lineage, but be aware that LineageOS sees much of the security mitigations and policies as being antithetical to their approach to cater to power users who desire to do what they want, and don't want security to get in the way.
23:57:26 <chile09[m]> <Felix[m]4 "Really good privacy but not as s"> could you explain further please; it is topical because both are Android ROMs and comparing them shows how they are different and potentially better/worse
23:57:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ultimately, I chose GrapheneOS because I learned the hard way numerous times that sometimes being a power user isn't necessarily a compliment.
23:57:33 <backupaccmovedto> <exifran[m] "Not really"> it depends on what you want
23:58:19 <strcat[m]> vata0: the leader of their organization has directly participated in bullying/harassment against me and supports / promotes a content creator who is literally obsessed with me and essentially stalks me across platforms while organizing raids on the channel + harassment
23:58:30 <kradav[m]> i wouldnt say, that it caters to different audiences. i would like to see a bigger overlap, with lineageos qol features and grapheneos security
23:58:40 <strcat[m]> vata0: it's unacceptable, and it's at the point where I'm willing to ban people simply for supporting a project engaging in that
23:59:06 <strcat[m]> the fact that they spent months putting together a bunch of lies/misrepresentations and doctored 'evidence' to misrepresent me defending myself like this against their attacks is ridiculous
23:59:08 <vata0[m]> Dam
23:59:09 <strcat[m]> they have caused immense harm
23:59:14 <strcat[m]> going forward there is zero tolerance policy
23:59:21 <Felix[m]4> <chile09[m] "could you explain further please"> Well for starters, it doesn't include Google service stuff out of the box which is good for privacy. It requires an unlocked bootloader though which is trash for security
23:59:24 <strcat[m]> if you support a project engaging in that, you aren't welcome here
