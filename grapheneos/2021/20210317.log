00:07:05 <qubits> Hi can someone explain me why get push notifications from an application in case my device is connected to power but when i disconnet i wil not get push notification untill i unlock device
00:10:19 <uhsa> hello, i just received my pixel 4a and it says it runs android 11 with the 5 december 2020 security update. Can i use the installer right away or should i connect to internet and check for updates first?
00:13:05 <tedlancer[m]> Does anyone know what's going on w calendar app that came w grapheneos? It disappeared from apps list but shows up on widget. I didn't use it since I couldn't make it to work. Just curious...
00:13:30 <sphinx[m]> uhsa:
00:13:30 <sphinx[m]> > It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early in the installation process.
00:15:17 <sphinx[m]> tedlancer: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.03.06.00
00:15:17 <sphinx[m]> > Calendar: remove launcher icon since the app exists for compatibility / testing
00:15:20 <uhsa> sorry what does best practice mean my english is not perfect
00:16:06 <mynacol[m]> uhsa: Not required, but recommended
00:16:58 <uhsa> thank you

00:48:34 <jj1013[m]1> If I almost always use my owner user for everything and other users in rare cases, would it still be safe to store important data on the owner user?
00:48:35 <jj1013[m]1> Can encrypted disks which keys are not at rest be compromised by apps such as WhatsApp, G-Mail or Hotmail?

02:59:50 <rny> wait 12h+ zzz
02:59:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> ok
03:00:31 <rny> building is such a drag

06:08:55 <strcat> rny: about to try myself for 3a
06:09:03 <strcat> rny: this makes hardened_malloc change harder
06:09:09 <strcat> since it has to only be done for the newer devices
06:09:26 <strcat> will be nice when 3, 3 XL, etc. are in ESR so we don't have to have these workarounds in the main branch
06:10:34 <rny> ESR?
06:14:36 <strcat[m]> extended support release
07:09:50 <rny> strcat[m]: at least it boots...
07:10:03 <rny> but yea, not usable.
07:11:38 <strcat[m]> rny: graphics driver all fucked up right?
07:11:44 <strcat[m]> rny: on 3a?
07:11:46 <rny> yea
07:11:58 <rny> on the first run, it was ok, after reboot its fucked.
07:12:41 <rny> is it worthwhile trying to fix this
07:12:53 <rny> and if i wanted to, how to approach this @_@
07:13:16 <rny> i got minicom attached, the logs arent really helpful...
07:16:04 <strcat[m]> rny: nah
07:16:07 <strcat[m]> not worth trying to fix it
07:16:28 <strcat[m]> rny: we just need to figure out the best way to use a different hardened_malloc configuration for devices with fucked up older generation GPU driver code
07:21:36 <strcat[m]> rny: maybe you an figure that out?
07:21:51 <strcat[m]> rny: I don't really know the best way to make Android.bp use a different set of cflags for some devies
07:23:32 <strcat[m]> rny: if you look at Android.bp
07:23:41 <strcat[m]> rny: you can see we use much smaller address space values than the Makefile defaults
07:23:59 <strcat[m]> rny: we need to change it to use the same values as the Makefile defaults on devices that are using 48-bit address space
07:24:10 <strcat[m]> should probably be opt-in (devices mark themselves as using large address space)
07:24:16 <rny> cant you use a different branch for different devices?
07:24:24 <strcat[m]> rny: that's too much work
07:24:34 <strcat[m]> rny: also makes it harder to use our sources
07:24:50 <strcat[m]> any newly added device won't have 48-bit address space til they port over kernel hardening
07:24:53 <strcat[m]> and may not work for some devices
07:24:56 <strcat[m]> similar to Pixel 3
07:24:59 <rny> ok
07:25:01 <strcat[m]> it's not strictly an 'old device' thing

16:24:05 <Jgem[m]> If graheneos had its own work profile manager app would that make it possible to implement that feature safely. And not with the intention of being as a type of sandbox implementation but as a way to have the a second instance of apps in the same user. Such as a second signal number, even too numbers using molly, whatever it is you want two of, without having to go to another user. This helps for instance because while
16:24:05 <Jgem[m]> yes you can switch users for  things, you cannot have a functioning signal app with the main signal number you use to communicate with most people, in multiple users .. With signal only activating the last install and setup you did with their for a number. So when I switch users to do something I miss signal calls that only my daily driver user gets.

16:32:33 <gochoingles[m]> I just noticed that my Telegram message took a while to come through. The bridge has some kind of delay.
16:33:08 <gochoingles[m]> * has some kind of delay for the Telegram sends.
16:33:16 <sjsndnjdejd> it goes to irc first
16:33:22 <sjsndnjdejd> 2 bridges
16:33:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Oh.
16:37:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <j‚Äã_a_m_e_z> Can you turn off just the 5G functionality with a pixel 4a (5G) & Pixel 5 (in GOS)?
16:41:17 <skwisgaar[m]> Jgem: I think it comes down to the multiple users feature already existing, along with the fact that the work profile isn‚Äôt meant to be used in the way you‚Äôre describing, even if you don‚Äôt care whether the apps are sandboxed.
16:42:11 <skwisgaar[m]> Either way I don‚Äôt think the project has enough resources atm to develop that even if it wanted to.
16:43:04 <skwisgaar[m]> And although signal is a secure messaging app, having two instances so you don‚Äôt have to switch profiles is a usability/convenience thing.
16:46:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> hey i did not get any pms
16:46:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> we need more testers
16:54:39 <dannyknoll3Danny> I'm on 3aXL beta channel
16:54:42 <dannyknoll3Danny> Anything I should be testing?
16:57:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J‚Äãxoec> How should I do that?
17:31:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> https://www.dev2qa.com/android-adb-install-uninstall-app-examples/
17:32:49 <gochoingles[m]> Greetings! I have a question about the multiple users function. If I separate untrusted apps each in their own isolated user (and log off them after I finish using my app, while still being logged on my main account), should I still set my main account as a secondary instead of owner? Can keys that are not at rest be compromised by an app in the phone?
17:33:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> https://jimcofer.com/2019/02/18/uninstalling-android-apps-via-adb/
17:33:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I haven't tested any of these
17:34:55 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: In order to compromise the encrypion keys living in the phone's memory, the app would have to break out of its application sandbox, which would require breaking the mandatory access controls set by Linux, then it would require a kernel exploit to get to root.
17:35:11 <TheJollyRoger> Both types of exploits would require breaking Linux.
17:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> There are only a very small number of processes on Android (init, and vold come to mind) which are given root-equivalent access and even then they are still confined by the SELinux Mandatory Access Controls set by the kernel.
17:37:27 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS aims to make it significantly more difficult to do something like this by removing unnecessary attack surface and further restricting the mandatory access controls, and increasing memory safety to mitigate exploits, before someone could pivot them into vulnerabilities.
17:39:28 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: welcome to the Matrix side of the bridge.
17:41:00 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: For beta testing, remember that we don't have telemetry nor error reporting in GrapheneOS, so when beta releases go out, someone (usually myself, but in the past I've been beaten to it before) will usually open a "RQ Release Beta Test results" on the issue tracker, and talk about what results we get. The long story short is, you're going to be using your phone as normal, and
17:41:02 <TheJollyRoger> just trying to tell us if you find something that is broken, that wasn't broken before.
17:41:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Ahoy, Peter! Thank you!
17:41:17 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles Ahoy shipmate!
17:41:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, hope this helps!
17:43:07 <dannyknoll3Danny> I can break shit with the best. Thanks, TheJollyRoger
17:43:23 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: Arr, good luck! Let me find you an example of one previous one:
17:43:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Considering I always will have my main account open, I have nothing to worry about.
17:44:36 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/480 I should stress, the checklist is just a *suggestion* - generally, what you should do is just try to use your phone as much as you can, in as many different ways as you can. Take pictures, take videos, install apps, remove apps, take seedvault backups, etc...
17:45:35 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: The important thing is to note if something that *wasn't broken previously* is *newly broken in this release*. Generally, some stuff has been broken from upstream, but that stuff can be safely ignored and marked as "broken before" or "broken upstream."
17:46:19 <dannyknoll3Danny> Aye!
17:46:34 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: I have a beta IRC channel at #freenode_#grapheneos-beta:matrix.org (I think I got that right?) or just #grapheneos-beta on Freenode. This channel's only used to ping notifications though, so it's fairly inactive until a beta release goes out, at which point I ping everybody and let them know an update is coming.
17:47:10 <TheJollyRoger> We only have around maybe one day, sometimes a little less, to mark stuff as stable, so it's important to start using your phone to do as much as you can during this time.
17:47:21 <TheJollyRoger> If you notice no problems, then be sure to reply "Tested, it's good."
17:47:56 <TheJollyRoger> Time is of the essence because it's important to get the security patches out as quickly as possible: the rest of the userbase is counting on the betatesters to vet things before they get pushed to the general public.
17:49:03 <TheJollyRoger> So it's something of a trial-by-fire for each release, using real-world users, using real-world use cases.
17:49:14 <gochoingles[m]> Do OS bugtesters have heavy numbers of backups or something? Venezuelans should have a hard time bugtesting, considering the limited options and storage we have for backups.
17:49:51 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: I like to use seedvault, but I also have my own Signal backups. This I can do using an ordinary 16GB thumb drive.
17:52:08 <dannyknoll3Danny> <TheJollyRoger "Time is of the essence because i"> I'm joined up and cliqued up ‚Äî thanks for your efforts
17:53:16 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: there are two levels of testing in GrapheneOS. The first is internal testing among the developers, which is *not* open to the public, and while in theory you could, I recommend you don't unless you're a developer and have resources available to handle it. The second is the beta testing channel, which you can upgrade to at any time, and downgrade to the next month. However,
17:53:18 <TheJollyRoger> occasionally you may experience minor bugs like the camera may break, because sometimes upstream makes mistakes that the security hardening measures in GrapheneOS will expose. Once the beta channel guys post in and say "Hey, everything's good, we don't see anything new that this release breaks" then the beta becomes marked as stable and goes to everybody else.
17:53:41 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: Woohoo, excellent, thank you so much and welcome aboard the beta channel!
17:54:23 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: if you're feeling apprehensive, then you can stay on the Stable channel. That's the most extensively tested version and it's recommended for production.
17:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: Stable is generally selected by default but you can view which release channel your phone is set to, by going to "Settings -> System -> System Update Settings" and ensuring you see "Release Channel" says "Stable."
17:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> If for some inexplicable reason you accidentally downloaded Beta by mistake and you see "Beta" there, you can switch back to Stable. Right now, Beta and Stable are the same thing, so at the next stable release your phone will return to Stable.
17:57:03 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS uses anti-downgrade protection, so remember that versions can go /forward/ but we cannot set them /backward/ while the bootloader is locked.
17:59:13 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise the phone will detect it as a hostile attack and block it.
18:03:02 <gochoingles[m]> <TheJollyRoger "gochoingles: I like to use seedv"> Weird. I have more GB of data than just that. I have heard there's 1-TB USB sticks. Do you think they are expensive, or really prone to bad blocks?
18:03:29 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: well, I'm a very light user, so I don't have that much data.
18:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> I actually haven't bought any of those 1TB USB drives. I generally find myself if I need storage, I tend to just buy those packaged hard drives when they go on sale on Black Friday and remove them from their enclosures using a screwdriver.
18:04:42 <TheJollyRoger> Since often for some extremely bizarre reason they're often sold for less than the sum of their parts.
18:05:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> USB flash drives being extremely prone to failure/unreliable was a thing when I was younger, so I avoid purchasing anything above 64GB USB-wise. I have seen some around with 5-year warranties so maybe that has changed.
18:05:44 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: this makes sense, they're cramming all those bits into increasingly tinier spaces.
18:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> So far, I have gotten lucky with a 128GB Corsair Voyager GTX, but it only sees fairly light and occasional use.
18:06:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> Also, they will be extremely disproportionately expensive (last post because off-topic).
18:06:25 <TheJollyRoger> Arr.
18:06:35 <TheJollyRoger> Thank'ee.
18:20:07 <rosie> I understand there are no bundled apps with GrapheneOS, but what functionality will I have immediately after installing GrapheneOS?¬† I'm envisioning a bare-bones blank screen after the GrapheneOS install with zero functionality (dialer, keyboard, file manager, etc.) that I don't find a way to install myself. Is that inaccurate?
18:21:10 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> Patiently waiting on my pixel 3a to be delivered....so excited to make the switch from lineage is. Is there anything in particular I should look out for on the install? Suggestions?
18:22:02 <M647509735485097> Are there any plans to implement ad-blocking to Vanadium?
18:23:00 <M647509735485097> <rosie "I understand there are no bundle"> It comes with all the essentials. Your first task would probably be to install F-Droid and then Aurora Store for any apps you may want
18:23:18 <Liam99> hey again
18:23:30 <Liam99> can anbody please help me here with this
18:23:31 <Liam99> Error: The requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired
18:23:41 <Liam99> occurs at the end of flashing factory images
18:23:54 <rosie> How do I go about installing F-Droid?¬† Will I have enough functionality on the phone to do that much?¬† If so, I'm home free after that.
18:25:40 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> <rosie "How do I go about installing F-D"> https://f-droid.org/
18:25:48 <Lestat[m]> F-droid aint rly liked around these parts
18:25:49 <Lestat[m]> Aurora store is the shit
18:26:38 <rosie> Yes, I know where to find it, but do I install directly from the Web site, or do I download and install?
18:26:39 <poisonoushydra[m> <t3ktn0nym0us[m] "Patiently waiting on my pixel 3a"> Make sure to follow one of the official guides at https://grapheneos.org/install/
18:27:18 <rosie> And why is F-droid not liked here?¬† (other than not the most user-friendly interface)
18:28:55 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> <rosie "Yes, I know where to find it, bu"> When you go on the site, there is a link to download. If you want to be safe, right under the link, there is the PGP signature. I'd verify the download with that
18:30:56 <rosie> Ok, so I will have the functionality to install from that download?¬† (As I said, I was anticipating a blank screen after installing GrapheneOS.)
18:31:19 <dannyknoll3Danny> <rosie "Yes, I know where to find it, bu"> The self contained web installer is being recommended at this time.
18:31:45 <dannyknoll3Danny> (I think?)
18:32:46 <poisonoushydra[m> <rosie "Ok, so I will have the functiona"> You will have a typical launcher and Vanadium browser by default.
18:33:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy rosie, welcome aboard. You'll have a web browser, auditor, a file browser, and the secure PDF viewer and a messaging and dialer and contacts app after you've installed GrapheneOS, as well as the AOSP Camera app.
18:34:18 <TheJollyRoger> If you want, you can download F-Droid from their website through Vanadium; GrapheneOS enforces basic Android Certificate Pinning policies on installation throughout the lifetime of the app, so the PGP signature is largely theatre unless you have an authenticated back-channel back to the F-Droid developers themselves.
18:34:21 <rosie> Ok, perfect!¬† Next question:¬† Playing devil's advocate here (because someone challenged me on it and I don't have an answer):¬† Why is it safer, more secure, more private to install an OS that require only unlocking, then relocking the bootloader rather than installing an OS that requires rooting and installing TWRP first?
18:35:27 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: No problem, I can answer your question: the late-stage qualcomm bootloader is treated as the root of trust on all Android devices (and guess what! It's open source). When you install it that way, and have the bootloader locked, it will ensure that your installation of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical to every other instance of GrapheneOS every boot.
18:36:19 <TheJollyRoger> Rooting on the other hand, destroys the android security model and is mutually exclusive with verified boot, meaning it'll also end up disabling all other security features that depend on it (hardware bound encryption, hardware backed keying) and leave you with no proper root of trust.
18:37:29 <TheJollyRoger> This is also why GrapheneOS at this moment, until we find a hardware partner that is willing to work with us on producing a handset, is only available for the Pixels; it's because other vendors that aren't Google are actually *hostile* to the idea of running non-vendor operating systems on it, or don't adequately support verified boot for third-party keying.
18:37:48 <rosie> That makes sense (and makes me feel better about my choice of GrapheneOS).¬† So the Android Security Model disables any possibility of a back door?
18:38:17 <TheJollyRoger> So, I'd like you to bear in mind our rule about bikeshedding, but I can entertain you for a bit about this:
18:38:46 <rosie> Bikeshedding?
18:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> Back doors don't work the way popular culture often believes them to work; if anything, that's where popular culture got things extremely wrong; the Vault7 and Shadowbrokers dumps actually showed a very different pattern to popular assumption.
18:40:05 <TheJollyRoger> Instead of having "god level" golden keys that allowed them to defeat security measures, very often government agencies and offensive hacking groups rely on low-hanging fruit, such as common vulnerabilities, but what makes them fascinating, is that they find ways to get them to work in concert with another.
18:41:09 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This is also why GrapheneOS at t"> Thank you for explaining this. Never knew this! One thing I do know is that it was Snowden who recommend Graphene and others in the privacy community that said any AOSP is fine.
18:41:58 <TheJollyRoger> "Bikeshedding" is a term describing the law of triviality; wasting mental bandwidth and time by discussing things that might seem important, but don't add up to anything of much importance in the long run. The term originates from an apocryphal tale about how when faced with the decision making of building a nuclear power plant, all the managers didn't know how to grasp the complexity of the
18:42:00 <TheJollyRoger> nuclear power plant, and spent more time fussing about what colour to paint the bike shed, because the bike shed was something accessible to them that they could easily understand and fuss about.
18:42:32 <TheJollyRoger> t3ktn0nym0us[m]: You're welcome! Yes, it's a common question we get asked here.
18:42:49 <rosie> "they find ways to get them to work in concert with one another"¬† Are you referring to the gov agencies and the hacking groups working together or the vulnerabilities working together?
18:43:27 <rosie> Thanks for the info on bikeshedding.¬† I'm still trying to get a handle on what is important from a security/privacy standpoint.
18:43:30 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: In that context, I'm referring to how they use common vulnerabilities - such as unpatched home routers, insecure smarthome gadgets, and outdated handsets - to work in concert with each other.
18:44:00 <rosie> Gotcha.¬† I'm working diligently to cover all my bases, but it's a LOT of learning curve right now.
18:44:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, heh heh, welcome aboard! It's a steep learning curve indeed, and it's very easy to end up going down the wrong path of not learning how to adequately threat model, or wasting your time on things that sound impressive, but don't give you much actual privacy in the long run.
18:46:16 <TheJollyRoger> If I could go back to when I first started my privacy journey and have five minutes to sit down and chat with my younger self, it'd be to tell my younger self that no matter how much of a badass you are, you're always a learner at the keyboard, and that humility and willingness to learn is going to get you further, and get you there faster, than tech-savviness.
18:46:17 <rosie> That's partly what makes the learning curve so steep.¬† Wish I didn't even have to think about such things, that everyone (government entities, corporations, etc.) would just leave me alone to live my life.¬† But such is our world these days.
18:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed! Well, the good news is...
18:46:59 <TheJollyRoger> The process of learning to adequately, and properly threat model and nail down the specifics will help you out there.
18:48:01 <TheJollyRoger> I often hear people say, "start small and work your way up." The same goes for learning about online privacy. If your threat model is that of your deepest, darkest, most desperate attack fantasies, you'll never be satisfied nor will you ever feel confident in what you do.
18:48:24 <rosie> I think I have a decent handle on threat modeling in general, but when it comes to tech, I'm not even sure where to start.
18:48:56 <poisonoushydra[m> This is a great place to start!
18:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> Right on, then here's where you start getting specific on your threat model and finding out how defenses fail.
18:49:00 <rosie> And I consider myself pretty tech savvy, but privacy/security is an area I'm just barely starting to touch on.
18:49:09 <dannyknoll3Danny> situational awareness is observation, gotta learn more and more to be able to adequately observe =]
18:49:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
18:49:31 <rosie> Funny--I just wrote a paper for a class on situation awareness. . .
18:49:44 <rosie> and risk management
18:50:13 <dannyknoll3Danny> Use Graphene as your thesis lol
18:50:18 <TheJollyRoger> If you're already tech-savvy on this, great, because learning how people get in (and how information gets out) is going to help you tailor your threat model more specifically... I'd wish I'd picked that up sooner, rather than later.
18:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> Well hot damn, sounds like you got all you need to get started.
18:51:10 <rosie> Haha!¬† It was more about physical safety, and the paper is already turned in, but that would make a pretty good thesis!
18:51:16 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee, it would!
18:51:30 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS welcomes academic research with open arms!
18:52:58 <TheJollyRoger> This channel's open to the public, so feel free to stick around here and enjoy the company. I'm not a developer, but I can generally answer general questions about the operating system (more specific ones though, I'll generally ask you to wait and ask someone who knows more than I) and I'm usually up for just friendly chatting in general in #grapheneos-offtopic.
18:53:07 <rosie> It seems to me that wireless technology has opened things WIDE regarding potential threats.¬† (One of the reasons I stick with wired as much as I possibly can.)
18:54:09 <TheJollyRoger> Well, with respect to that, I'd like to stress something you may find interesting about GrapheneOS and our philosophy: lately, it's become increasingly more common to ditch the old line of thought of "trusted" networks, and simply treat the network as hostile.
18:54:48 <TheJollyRoger> Since the problem with treating networks as trusted, is that as soon as one device on them goes bad, for any reason (someone opened an action-based phishing E-mail and ran my-picture.jpg.exe), that network is now suspect.
18:54:52 <rosie> And here I'm coming from a baseline thinking of "the network is hostile".
18:55:09 <rosie> And I'm a charter member of the "belt and suspenders club".
18:55:15 <rosie> Two is one, one is none.
18:55:22 <TheJollyRoger> Right on!
18:56:08 <rosie> Leave as few attack vectors as possible.
18:56:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. GrapheneOS always treats the network as hostile with one very notable exception: SMS and voice calls over the publicly switched telephone network *always* trust the network because that's unfortunately, how they operate and everyone expects reverse compatibility all the way back to 1986 with SMS messages.
18:58:19 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> SMS.. Still a challenge to get non techies to move away from and download privacy and security oriented apps
18:58:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
18:58:29 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows at the thought of that!
18:59:02 <rosie> Does end-to-end encryption of text and voice help with that, or is that just theater?
18:59:58 <TheJollyRoger> TLS encryption helps immensely with that, and end-to-end encryption helps distrust the instant messaging service provider.
19:00:30 <dannyknoll3Danny> t3ktn0nym0us: Unpopular opinion: not challenging, most people just don't want to burn the social credit of requiring encryption
19:01:13 <dannyknoll3Danny> * t3ktn0nym0us: Unpopular opinion: not challenging, most people just don't want to burn social credit by requiring encryption
19:01:14 <TheJollyRoger> TLS (Transport Layer Encryption) is mandatory for all Android Apps. So if your adversary is on the network (rogue system administrator at your cellphone carrier, Stingray Cellphone interception tower), all they see is encrypted traffic going to someplace on usually a cloud server like Amazon AWS or Azure Cloud Services, or at a Data Center.
19:01:27 <rosie> How do you sort out disinformation about specific apps, their supposed ties to "listening" entities, etc.?
19:02:39 <TheJollyRoger> If you use End to end encryption, then if your adversary is at that cloud server, such, then they might be able to see who you routing to, but can't see what you're saying. Some efforts have been made to further obfuscate the who and from; Signal has been making strides with Sealed Sender to allow the server to see where traffic is being routed to, but not where it's from.
19:03:11 <TheJollyRoger> So, end to end encryption provides a *BIG* security gain.
19:04:43 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: That's a difficult and tricky one, actually. Generally when it comes to specific apps, you're going to want to critically examine those yourselves. For instance, although recent efforts have been made to enumerate libraries and SDKs used by certain apps, simply taking those as being indicative of badness or invasiveness is not in itself a solution; even if the app contains the library
19:04:46 <TheJollyRoger> and SDK (such as for instance, Google Firebase functionality), that doesn't necessarily mean the app uses it in an invasive way.
19:06:22 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, Signal, which is the gold standard in private messaging, utilizes Google Cloud Messaging functionality to display notifications if it detects that Play Services are active and functioning on your phone, to allow the app to "sleep" in the background, then tell the app to "wake up" and retrieve messages stored on the server, then go back to sleep again. This allows it to only run
19:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> while it's actively retrieving messages, yet still function offline, without needing to use battery power while it's at it.
19:06:46 <rosie> But is the potential there for it to open a vulnerability hole?
19:07:08 <TheJollyRoger> There's potential for anything to be a vulnerability hole; the only way for a computer to not be exploited, is for it to not be turing-complete.
19:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, if a computer is not turing-complete, it's no longer a computer.
19:07:25 <TheJollyRoger> However, here's where we have good news:
19:07:43 <TheJollyRoger> Apps on Android, and indeed, on GrapheneOS, are fully sandboxed at all times. They can only see what data you permit them to.
19:07:57 <rosie> Nice!
19:08:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. I like to compare this to aviation safety:
19:08:22 <TheJollyRoger> The only way we can make it physically possible for an aircraft not to crash, is to make it so the aircraft can't fly.
19:08:29 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, that doesn't make it very useful as an aircraft.
19:08:52 <rosie> (y)
19:08:55 <TheJollyRoger> So what we do, because we don't have materials of infinite strength, is to pile on successive amounts of mitigations, safety protocols, and redundancies in aviation,
19:09:17 <TheJollyRoger> so that should one system should fail, there's another, and another, and another, and hopefully, those successive mitigations can last until the aircraft can find a safe place to land and get everyone off.
19:09:31 <rosie> Now, that's language I understant!
19:09:37 <rosie> understand!
19:10:06 <TheJollyRoger> This is why we have things like ETOPS certifications and plans; should one engine quit, the other one can last us long enough to get to dry land.
19:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS functions the same way; the only way for a phone to not be exploited, is for it to not be turing complete, but then if it's not turing complete, it's not really a programmable computer any longer. So what we do is we pile on successive amounts of exploit mitigations and security and sandboxing and containment;
19:11:42 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, there's the verified boot to guarantee authenticity of the system image, so that it matches the developers' right down to the last bit. There's remote attestation so you can prove that the keys are authentic.
19:12:45 <TheJollyRoger> There's the android sandboxing system and mandatory access controls, which ensure that even privileged system components are internally sandboxed and separate from each other in the event one turns bad. For the apps, there's also the certificate pinning to ensure that apps can only be developed by the respective developers that signed them.
19:13:14 <TheJollyRoger> Each app has its own private data storage that only it can see, which is removed if the app is ever uninstalled so that people can't be tricked into unpinning the certificate, then installing a malicious release in its stead.
19:13:59 <TheJollyRoger> By adding on more and more and more of these extra layers of security, validation, and safety checks, it's our hope that should a hole be found in one layer, the remaining layers will last us long enough for us to fix what broke.
19:14:05 <TheJollyRoger> Just like an aircraft.
19:14:14 <rosie> Very cool!
19:16:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! GrapheneOS seeks to raise the barriers to exploit potential holes even further - this is why for instance GrapheneOS rewrote the memory allocator, and spawns each new process as its own process, rather than cloning a process and then modifying it to suit; there may be a very very slight (like 1/10th of a second, except on legacy platforms like the Pixel 3a, which is a budget device with a
19:16:12 <TheJollyRoger> slower processor and storage) performance decrease in loading and initialization, but the security benefits are there to mitigate exploits.
19:16:21 <gochoingles[m]> <TheJollyRoger "starts drowning his sorrows at t"> ACTION Seriously, how do you do that???
19:16:31 <TheJollyRoger> gochoingles[m]: Rum, matey! Rum!
19:16:42 * TheJollyRoger pours gochoingles[m] rum!
19:17:15 <dannyknoll3Danny> This is actually just TJR's AlAnon group, y'all are really disrupting
19:17:26 <rosie> I don't want to short-circuit this discussion, because it's very helpful, but I have another installation question.¬† Can I use Win7 or Linux Mint to install GrapheneOS?
19:17:47 <dannyknoll3Danny> rosie: Wouldn't recommend either, really. But, yes.
19:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: We don't suggest Windows 7. Last time someone tried it here, they found it actually has a buggy driver that doesn't properly enumerate the device and it wouldn't flash.
19:18:17 * poisonoushydra[m  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BawVMYnErwYyPazelUtpzBID/message.txt >
19:18:38 <TheJollyRoger> This will not be fixed in the future, because Microsoft gave Windows 7 the "final farewell" update last year.
19:19:47 <rosie> Good to know.¬† Yeah, I refuse to downgrade to Win10 spyware (unless I find an absolute need to run it in a VM under Linux).
19:19:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> Windows 7 is EoL since January 14, 2020https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020-b75d4580-2cc7-895a-2c9c-1466d9a53962
19:20:06 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: We *have* had people actually get the install to work on Linux Mint, but unfortunately you're going to be on your own for that and we can't help you if you run into an issue.
19:20:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> nonsense. 10 isn<#
19:20:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> nonsense. 10 isn't Spyware nor a Downgrade related to 7
19:20:40 <rosie> Matter of opinion, I think.
19:20:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> 10 adds a lot security and privacy improvements
19:20:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> matter of facts
19:21:00 <rosie> I think we'll have to agree to disagree.
19:22:49 <rosie> I trust M$ about as far as I can throw them.
19:23:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> it's OT but read why Linux is a lot more insecure then Windows or MacOS:https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html
19:23:25 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> Has there been any issues installing Graphene OS on an arch system?
19:24:26 <rosie> I guess I'll look at some of the other Linux distros for my GrapheneOS install then, at least temporarily.¬† I'm most familiar with Linux Mint, though.
19:26:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> you can also use web installer
19:26:52 <TheJollyRoger> This is because GrapheneOS treats the signed and verified bootloader of the phone and the phone's security chip as its root of trust, not the computer doing the installation.
19:27:12 <rosie> I thought you still had to have one of the supported OSes in order to use the Web installer.¬† Is that not the case?
19:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> Other people have found it to work on other platforms, but I do not know which ones they are. Those are the ones that are tested.
19:28:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, looks like a few of my messages got dropped and I need to repost them.
19:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: It may surprise you that Windows 10 isn't as invasive as a lot of people make it out to be. Yes, by default the defaults favour Microsoft, but it's not doing what it's doing without consent nor being clear about it in the privacy policy.
19:28:25 <TheJollyRoger> Bashing Windows 10 on privacy is something of a meme which a lot of people like to do to build what I call "opsec nerd credit" among like-minded folks, but among people who understand the nuance and are willing to look deeper, it doesn't hold up.
19:28:32 <TheJollyRoger> If you really still would prefer not to run Windows 10, for your convenience poisonoushydra[m's enumerated the list of currently supported operating systems for the commandline method. I recommond the web installation method, since it's faster, simpler, and safer.
19:29:00 <TheJollyRoger> You may find this a bit unintuitive, but remember that GrapheneOS relies on the attestation of the hardware backed keystore for authentication, and verified boot to be secure. As a result, the computer that's installing GrapheneOS is to an extent distrusted, so it won't make a difference if you install it from Windows 10, or your ultra-secure-super-whizbang supercomputer.
19:29:10 <TheJollyRoger> That is, on the condition you're able to find a computer you trust to view the attestation data.
19:29:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> well written TheJollyRoger üëç
19:29:40 <TheJollyRoger> There we go, that's reposted.
19:29:47 <rosie> So I still should have a supported OS in order to use the Web installer?
19:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, thankee @NorwegianFrost!
19:30:26 <doittoit[m]> Does GOS installer work on Win10 with W10Privacy installed?
19:30:44 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: Yes. While you may find that it works on other hosts, the thing is we don't always know what they are. Remember that the driver that talks to fastboot is important even if you have a supported version of Chromium/Chrome/Edge or some other Chromium based browser, but we can't test everything.
19:31:09 <rosie> Brave?
19:31:11 <TheJollyRoger> doittoit[m]: The installer works on Windows 10 with edge, but I can't make any guarantees about third-party software that may or may not be doing what you may or may not assume it to be doing.
19:31:43 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: Some of our members have anecdotally reported it to work with Brave, on the condition that the fastboot driver is present and functioning on their operating system.
19:32:02 <rosie> How do I check for the fastboot driver?
19:32:13 <TheJollyRoger> Those supported Linux distributions have it.
19:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> Microsoft also makes it an optional download and will automatically install it if you plug in your phone and click on Windows Update.
19:33:34 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "rosie: It may surprise you that "> To be fair you can't just change a few buttons in the Settings program, you have to go into the Registry and Group Policy to completely disable it
19:33:34 <TheJollyRoger> Those are the Linux distributions that can be regularly tested and reported working on known good hardware.
19:33:48 <dannyknoll3Danny> TheJollyRoger: Hey friend, if I have Nitrokeys, what are my options on Graphene for using them to securely access a Gmail account? Assume privacy is secondary/not a concern.
19:34:01 <doittoit[m]> Just wondering, thanks. I think this is worth checking. As far as I know W10privacy is the only tool out there recommened (by anonymous planet project) to preseve W10 security while disabling major tracking features.
19:34:36 <grapheneos_user_> <doittoit[m] "Just wondering, thanks. I think "> No dont
19:34:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> doittoit you can do that by yourself in Group policys or just using Windows privacy settings
19:34:58 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: At this moment, if you want to use U2F to log in to accounts, Vanadium currently at this moment requires a library from Play Services to handle U2F. Other apps that do U2F on their own without reliance on the Play Services implementation can do it, but I don't know which ones they are.
19:35:36 <dannyknoll3Danny> I wonder if Gmail is one of them.
19:35:51 <TheJollyRoger> doittoit[m]: I would not use W10Privacy, it's a third party app that you don't know what it's doing. If you feel you must, do what grapheneos_user_ suggested and simply take note of which settings you modify, and change those yourself, and don't mess with updates; that's a very dangerous thing to do.
19:36:09 <TheJollyRoger> doittoit[m]: I don't want to discuss other operating systems that aren't topical to GrapheneOS here though, in this channel.
19:37:24 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: Ah, sorry, but I must confess my knowledge ends there. I don't know about the others, so far I've just had to get by without U2F on my phone. GrapheneOS fully supports YubiKeys by both NFC and USB, but Vanadium needs that library from Play Services to do U2F, we're hoping we can patch that library back into Vanadium on its own at a later date.
19:37:49 <doittoit[m]> <TheJollyRoger "doittoit: I don't want to discus"> No problem.
19:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks, shipmate!
19:39:09 <dannyknoll3Danny> <TheJollyRoger "dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro)"> This is a matter of finding a contributor?
19:39:28 <TheJollyRoger> dannyknoll3Danny: Yeah, help is definitely wanted and would be greatly appreciated!
19:42:53 <rosie> Well I guess I need to check out some Linux distros, then.¬† Arch and Debian are preferred due to the Snap package issue under Ubuntu??
19:43:39 <rosie> And what is U2F?
19:43:46 <TheJollyRoger> Well, Arch is generally preferred because that's what some of our developers use, and they properly version their software and are prompt with updates.
19:44:04 <rosie> Good to know!
19:44:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. They remain close to upstream.
19:46:41 <TheJollyRoger> U2F is a hardware authentication protocol that relies on a security key. The security key contains a secret, and can prove the authenticity of the secret without revealing it by using public-key cryptography. It does so in a privacy-preserving way and is very secure, allowing you to authenticate yourself to different websites, without those different websites being able to collaborate your
19:46:43 <TheJollyRoger> different identities to a particular key.
19:47:01 <TheJollyRoger> (ie: the secret that it produces for say, login.com, is going to be different, than say, mylogin.com)
19:47:09 <rosie> Ahh.
19:47:34 <TheJollyRoger> This is meant to guard against phishing attacks that can actually defeat One-Time Passcodes by simply relaying the one-time-passcode onto the legitimate authentication page.
19:47:44 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Well, Arch is generally preferre"> Thanks for confirmation!
19:47:55 <TheJollyRoger> t3ktn0nym0us[m]: ye be welcome, shipmate!
19:48:27 <rosie> Just saw this on the Arch Linux Web site:¬† "Chromium losing Sync support in early March"¬† Does that affect GrapheneOS/Vanadium or its installation in any way?
19:49:09 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: in the context of GrapheneOS, GrapheneOS will allow you to use U2F, but the onboard Browser in GrapheneOS currently doesn't implement it because upstream have chosen to rely on a code library that's normally in Play Services, which we don't have. So we're hoping that maybe someone might help us implement that library as a self-contained item.
19:49:18 <poisonoushydra[m> Sync allows you to share things like your browsing history and bookmarks across multiple devices.
19:49:23 <TheJollyRoger> However, other apps that do contain their own U2F code will work fine with U2F on GrapheneOS.
19:49:43 <TheJollyRoger> I don't even know if we have Sync on GrapheneOS.
19:49:55 <TheJollyRoger> *Er, I don't even know if we have Chromium Sync on GrapheneOS.
19:50:21 <TheJollyRoger> I don't see it in the menu, I can check to see if it was patched out but unfortunately I am running out of time.
19:50:42 <rosie> No worries!¬† As long as it's not a show-stopper for installation.
19:51:16 <fybb> Anyone experienced problems with webrtc connection setup when using wireguard and graphene? Most of the time there is no issue, but every now and then, the webrtc API returns an empty list for local proposals and the app (Conversations in this case) failes to establish the connection. The tunnel works fine to send/retrieve data and the problem can be fixed by toggling the VPN connection.
19:52:01 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: it shouldn't be. Sync just allows you to have bookmarks saved by an account if I recall correctly.
19:52:17 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step away from the computer for a bit though, so I'll have to see you guys later.
19:52:20 <rosie> Is that the only thing it syncs?
19:52:45 <TheJollyRoger> It also syncs passwords, history, and browser preferences.
19:52:53 <dannyknoll3Danny> fybb I don't think it's a Graphene or Wireguard thing. I think Elements and Conversations calls just suck.
19:52:55 <rosie> TheJollyRoger¬† Thanks for all your help!
19:53:03 <TheJollyRoger> Which is likely why we don't have it on GrapheneOS, since that requires trusting an account.
19:53:12 <TheJollyRoger> So GrapheneOS users are not affected by this change.
19:53:14 <rosie> Makes sense!
19:53:19 <TheJollyRoger> rosegreenway[m]: yarr, ye be welcome!

19:53:53 <poisonoushydra[m> It can sync all of these things, at least on ChromeOS.
19:54:30 <fybb> dannyknoll3Danny: The calling feature in conversations have worked great for my except for this issue that happens from time to time. Looking at the log I can see that no proposals are returned, so that explains the issue. Do not know why there are no proposals though
19:55:07 <rosie> I never use browser syncing anyway.¬† Just wanted to make sure it wouldn't cause any other issues for a GrapheneOS install.
19:56:39 <fybb> Have what might be related log entries from the device entering standby mode, which changes states for all networks with the ConnectivityManager and finally unregisteres them. When the device comes back, only the LTE network is re-registered with the ConnectivityManager (and not the VPN)
20:49:19 <LostOne> Anyone here with a Pixel 4XL, I'm having an issue unlocking the bootloader.
20:50:01 <rosie> Is the device carrier-unlocked?
20:50:43 <LostOne> From my understanding it is.
20:51:53 <rosie> Is this your device, or someone else"s?¬† Is it new? Used?¬† Refurb?
20:52:59 <LostOne> It is my device, I bought it referb from back market
20:54:48 <LostOne> Ok, dumb question, do I need to have my sim card in it before I load graphene?
20:54:53 <rosie> My guess is that it wasn't unlocked (or at least not properly unlocked) when you purchased it.¬† Have you tried the OEM unlocking procedure on the installation page of the GOS Web site?
20:56:05 <LostOne> I did, when I boot into the bootloader it says that Device state: Locked
20:57:48 <rosie> I'm in no way an expert here (hopefully the experts will chime in soon), but I would say that the device is still carrier locked.
20:58:03 <LostOne> It should be unlocked because I can use my sim in it.
20:58:38 <rosie> It's possible that it's locked to the same carrier you use.
21:00:15 <LostOne> I suppose that is a possibility, when I ordered I selected an unlocked phone, but what they sent me the fist time was locked to Spectrum, the second one I didn't have that issue.
21:03:59 <rosie> You've reached the limit of my knowledge on the subject, but hopefully someone else here will be able to help you.
21:04:09 <LostOne> lol, thanks anyways!
21:04:41 <rosie> Did you leave the SIM in the device while you were attempting to unlock the bootloader?¬† If so, maybe try it without?
21:05:28 <LostOne> I was trying without it, I'll try it with the sim card.
21:05:48 <rosie> Sounds like a plan!

22:05:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy @gochoingles. Yes, a little. I can't stay online for long today since I have to get out, but the short version is that Telegram leaks a lot of metadata that can be viewed by third party clients even if you don't add them to your contact list, and its MT-Proto cryptography is homerolled and unsafe.
22:05:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles it was audited, and the results were "plaintext recovery isn't quite yet feasible, but they made a lot of rookie mistakes."
22:05:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> Its audit was also carried out back before SHAttered.
22:05:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> Telegram's encryption is heavily reliant on SHA-1.
22:05:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> We've gotten a lot better in attacks since those days.
22:05:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> The other issue I have is that "Secret Chat" is not on by default, so very few people use it.
22:05:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> last I saw, you had to go out of your way to have a Secret Chat and it was feature crippled so nobody really used it.
22:05:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> Rather than simply being able to quickly and opportunistically enable Secret Chat on an existing conversation.
22:05:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <mazyani[m]> <Telegram-Bridge "<gochoingles> Once I get the Goo"> Molly foss is awesome
22:05:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, so I would probably suggest returning to Signal for your secure chat needs.
22:05:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Sorry if this counts as spam.
