00:01:44 <rny> the first vendor to release open hardware will also be the last!
00:02:03 <rny> since they are gonna get rickrolled so bad by all the other vendors
00:04:53 <TheJollyRoger> Argh. I really hope not.
00:22:26 <zer011[m]> Hello
00:25:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
00:29:28 <zer011[m]> Maybe you can suggest a program like I gnupg running on grapheme os
00:30:27 <TheJollyRoger> zer011[m]: if you're looking to use your Yubikey on GrapheneOS, you can download OpenKeyChain.
00:30:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yubikeys and J3H145 Dual-Interface cards will work with OpenKeyChain via NFC on GrapheneOS (although U2F is not yet implemented).
00:31:24 <TheJollyRoger> If you're looking for secure communication tools, the best you can get is Signal, which fully tested and working on GrapheneOS.
00:33:27 <zer011[m]> I am looking for such programs that I can encrypt my letter, and send to another person who would have my public key being able to read that letter
00:35:52 <zer011[m]> Yea I now try install openkeychain
00:35:59 <strcat> zer011[m]: strongly recommend using a proper secure messaging system instead of PGP
00:36:30 <strcat> PGP should only be a last resort if you can't use a messaging system with modern cryptography, forward secrecy, a reasonable trust system and UI, etc.
00:46:51 <zer011[m]> strcat: What software do you think is currently the safest? It was only my idea if I kept that secure system in an encrypted message. Wouldn't that get double protection?
00:48:07 <strcat[m]> zer011: PGP is far more likely to cause harm to you than help you
00:48:26 <strcat[m]> for example, it's unsafe to import a PGP key that you didn't create yourself
00:48:36 <strcat[m]> GPG can't handle untrusted input safely
00:48:37 <rny> strcat[m]: why would anyone do that ^?
00:48:43 <rny> @_@
00:49:14 <louipc> to check someones signature
00:49:36 <rny> importing a (private) key is how i read it
00:49:42 <strcat[m]> no
00:49:44 <strcat[m]> a public key
00:49:47 <rny> its routine to have to import someone else's public key
00:49:51 <rny> otherwise how to check!?
00:49:55 <strcat[m]> it's unsafe to import a public key from an attacker
00:49:59 <strcat[m]> yeah that's unsafe
00:50:04 <strcat[m]> GPG can't do that safely
00:50:05 <louipc> hehehe
00:50:18 <strcat[m]> rny:  you don't
00:50:42 <strcat[m]> rny:  also not supposed to use keyservers anymore largely because ANYONE can add data to other people's keys
00:50:49 <strcat[m]>  * rny:  also not supposed to use the distributed keyservers anymore largely because ANYONE can add data to other people's keys
00:51:07 <rny> ye, i got that memo
00:51:09 <louipc> plus most of them didnt even deploy tls
00:51:25 <rny> pgp is web of trust, why bother with tls?
00:51:26 <strcat[m]> rny:  yeah but I think you missed that it's unsafe to import a public key
00:51:36 <strcat[m]> those keyservers make it unsafe to import even your own public key
00:51:41 <strcat[m]> because people could have added unsafe data to it
00:51:43 <strcat[m]> and GPG can't handle it
00:51:48 <strcat[m]> that's the issue with those keyservers
00:52:00 <strcat[m]> but the source of the issue is that it can't import a key safely
00:52:13 <louipc> rny: for fun
00:52:37 <strcat[m]> the proper way to use GPG is to remove it and use a modern secure messaging system
00:52:47 <rny> gpg not being able to import a key safely, is it a standard's issue or an implementation issue?
00:52:54 <strcat[m]> and if you really have a need to sign / encrypt files on a case by case basis then use a well made tool for it
00:53:01 <rny> strcat[m]: gpg is not just for messaging though, i use it for other things
00:53:07 <strcat[m]> rny: GPG is very poorly implemented and maintained
00:53:16 <strcat[m]> PGP has standards issues such as being hard-coded to use SHA1
00:53:31 <strcat[m]> and not having stuff expected of a modern encryption system
00:53:46 <strcat[m]> rny: it's a mix of GPG issues and PGP issues
00:55:04 <strcat[m]> in general you should be phasing it out
00:55:08 <strcat[m]> find better alternatives
00:55:27 <strcat[m]> use signify, minisign or another alternative for signing
00:55:38 <strcat[m]> rny: depends on what specifically you're doing with it
00:55:39 <rny> i just use pgp for my password manager
00:57:32 <strcat> rny: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age is much better for encrypting files
00:58:14 <strcat> if you also want to sign it as coming from you instead of it being anonymous, also need signify
00:59:53 <strcat> it's still authenticated encryption without using signify but keep in mind it's anonymous (no proof it came from anyone in particular)
01:00:48 <zer011[m]> Yea you give me much information, I try it understand:) I am new in this thinks
01:01:17 <strcat> but don't use age for secure messaging - use a proper secure messaging system with forward secrecy
01:03:51 <zer011[m]> What about briar?
01:06:54 <TheJollyRoger> zer011[m]: Just use Signal.
01:07:32 <rny> lots of work to do to rewrite `pass` to use `git`, `age` and `signify`
01:08:23 <TheJollyRoger> I really hope someday, age and signify can be used to work with Trezor-Agent. That'd be boss.
01:10:11 <frostedpanel[m]> * > <@strcat:matrix.org> @room btw, due to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1194 Matrix users will be kicked after 30 days of not speaking in the channel, please just rejoin the channel if that happens, need to try to get them to prioritize fixing this
01:10:11 <frostedpanel[m]> 😀
01:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> Either that, or GnuPG needs to just "kill the baby" and drop backwards compatibility entirely and enforce strong, modern ciphers and cryptography. No more protocol negotiation back to 1993.
01:12:01 <strcat[m]> rny: just `age`, don't see a reason the others are needed for that
01:12:07 <rny> ye, i dont get what the pgp working group is thinking
01:12:28 <rny> why let broken crypto hold back pgp
01:12:34 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger:  it has no modern cryptography option at all
01:12:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:12:47 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
01:13:01 <rny> strcat[m]: what do you mean by there's no modern options?
01:13:02 <strcat[m]> and the whole keyring and trust model is terrible
01:13:07 <strcat[m]> the whole UX around it is terrible
01:13:12 <strcat[m]> rny: I mean it inherently uses SHA1
01:13:28 <rny> cant they revise the standard and drop SHA1 completely?
01:13:35 <TheJollyRoger> rny: we've been trying to!
01:13:40 <rny> and just increment the major version
01:13:56 <rny> decades old softwares often make major API revisions
01:14:00 <TheJollyRoger> Werner Koch and the others sent in a draft as RFC 4880bis, which added SHA256 fingerprints and EAX mode for the cipher.
01:14:18 <strcat[m]> rny: or we could just use `age` and do away with the mess of the GPG keyring, weird trust model, and messed up + massively overcomplicated UX
01:14:19 <TheJollyRoger> But it's... it's in limbo.
01:14:22 <strcat[m]> easier to use something good
01:14:34 <strcat[m]> rny: it has problems beyond not using modern crypto
01:14:50 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
01:14:58 <TheJollyRoger> *keeps drowning
01:15:09 <rny> web of trust is a reasonable trust model
01:15:29 <strcat[m]> it's really not, at least as meant by GPG
01:15:31 <TheJollyRoger> The thing that makes me sad about it is that I shouldn't need to write 200 pages of theory on key management in order for users to send a message.
01:15:36 <rny> so as long as everyone who participates in it knows what they are doing
01:15:41 <frostedpanel[m]> * > <@strcat:matrix.org> @room btw, due to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1194 Matrix users will be kicked after 30 days of not speaking in the channel, please just rejoin the channel if that happens, need to try to get them to prioritize fixing this
01:15:42 <frostedpanel[m]> 👀
01:15:42 <rny> which is an implicit assumption
01:15:45 <TheJollyRoger> As luck would have it, 200 pages *just simply wasn't enough.*
01:15:50 <strcat[m]> rny: which is ofc not right
01:16:02 <strcat[m]> rny: so, you verify your mom's safety number for your messaging system
01:16:08 <TheJollyRoger> I mean, I WANT to finish the book. I want to help them out, but...
01:16:13 <strcat[m]> how does that imply you trust all verifications she has done or ever will do?
01:16:19 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense as a trust model
01:16:34 <strcat[m]> and what does it even mean?
01:16:48 <strcat[m]> so, for example, if I meet someone on Matrix and have a chat with them
01:16:56 <strcat[m]> that is when I first met them
01:16:59 <strcat[m]> that is the person I met
01:17:17 <strcat[m]> if they earn my trust over time, it's that person who earned my trust, an out-of-band verification isn't useful
01:17:25 <strcat[m]> if I start a Signal conversation with them we can bootstrap it via Matrix
01:17:28 <strcat[m]> same for elsewhere
01:17:47 <strcat[m]> anyway how does it make any sense for someone else to trust my verification on Signal that it's the person I talk to on Matrix
01:17:52 <strcat[m]> there is context for that
01:17:57 <strcat[m]> I verified it's the same person I talk to on Matrix
01:18:08 <strcat[m]> it doesn't mean I trust them, or that I know them irl, or that I checked their government papers
01:18:47 <strcat[m]> GPG web of trust is basically a pretend game of "we checked your government papers" which is pretty meaningless (easy to fake, and are you even trained on verifying a passport at same shitty TSA level?)
01:18:52 <strcat[m]> and people DO NOT actually do that in practice
01:19:30 <strcat[m]> rny: I was an Arch Linux packager - that required having 3 signatures from the master keys on my key - none of them verified who I was or anything, it's just not what people actually do
01:19:57 <strcat[m]> anyway it really makes no sense
01:20:06 <strcat[m]> when I verify who someone is on Signal there is context for that
01:20:13 <strcat[m]> if I know them irl then I'm verifying it's that person I know irl
01:20:30 <strcat[m]> if I know them online, I'm verifying it's the person with that username I know on a few platforms online
01:20:45 <strcat[m]> I'm not verifying their legal identity / government papers
01:21:11 <strcat[m]> GPG has delusions that it's based on verifying people's "real" identity and outsourcing this system to a "web of trust" that's just a bunch of BS
01:21:22 <strcat[m]> rny: I'll happily go sign 1000 people's keys with a script right now
01:21:24 <strcat[m]> it's meaningless
01:21:38 <strcat[m]> why do people I've never heard of constantly sign my keys on those shitty keyservers? shrug
01:22:16 <strcat[m]> GPG web of trust is just a more messed up form of counting Twitter followers
01:23:10 <TheJollyRoger> I guess I can hang up my Reebok Pumps that I save for going to Keysigning parties...
01:23:28 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm joking)
01:23:30 <strcat[m]> also key rotations are really important and if you're going to do 1 thing on top of basic verification it should be that
01:23:40 <strcat[m]> and yet despite all the complexity GPG has
01:23:43 <strcat[m]> it can't even do that
01:23:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> For some reason seeing Reebok makes me feel old
01:24:15 <pvelli> hey folks
01:24:23 <pvelli> Im trying to install grapheneos
01:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: Bwahahaha, you know the feeling!
01:24:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy pvelli, yeah what's up?
01:24:37 <pvelli> but my fastboot isnt seein any devices
01:24:42 <pvelli> haha hey
01:24:43 <strcat[m]> pvelli: which OS
01:24:51 <pvelli> Thru windows
01:24:51 <strcat[m]> is the phone booted into the bootloader menu?
01:25:04 <pvelli> Yea i clicked volume down and power btn
01:25:14 <pvelli> im in fastboot mode on my phone
01:25:18 <strcat[m]> pvelli: what kind of cable / port is it connected with
01:25:24 <pvelli> usb c
01:26:00 <pvelli> same one that phone came with
01:26:29 <pvelli> at first i d9wnloaded repo thru command line
01:26:37 <pvelli> but then i tried from sdk site
01:26:41 <pvelli> still no go
01:28:41 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if it's missing the driver...?
01:28:45 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
01:28:58 <pvelli> got dcd
01:29:08 <pvelli> reloadin the page signed me out
01:29:18 <pvelli> did you answer anythin?
01:31:07 <TheJollyRoger> Er, not quite...
01:31:53 <TheJollyRoger> I was taking a bit of a guess, but have you got any spares? (Just in case, we've had problems with USB C to C on some platforms because of some vendors' not properly implementing USB)
01:33:39 <pvelli> spare usb c cables?
01:33:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, any A to Cs.
01:34:41 <pvelli> i have a charger cable from my othe phone
01:34:50 <pvelli> ill try connectin it
01:36:58 <pvelli> hmm stil no go
01:37:12 <pvelli> i dont think is be able to us an a cable on a 4a tho
01:37:14 <TheJollyRoger> Try to use the rear ports of your motherboard, we've had bad experiences with some motherboards and front ports before, but not sure which ones do or don't handle USB on the front ports.
01:37:19 <TheJollyRoger> A to C?
01:39:30 <pvelli> im using a laptop
01:40:45 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Uh... huh. I'm kinda out of ideas at the moment, unless the driver needs to be updated...?
01:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> (Through device manager)
01:41:08 <pvelli> yea ill see
01:41:16 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
01:45:39 <rny> You're supposedly meant to sign another person's key over coffee and a real life meetup under the web of trust model.
01:45:55 <rny> But yeah you make a fine point about people not knowing to do the right thing
01:49:44 <pvelli> weird eve when i connect my pixel 4a when its on
01:50:04 <strcat[m]> rny: still doesn't make much sense
01:50:08 <pvelli> it deosnt show another device mext to c disk
01:50:10 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense to me so it's not what I am going to do
01:50:18 <pvelli> unlike my regulsr phone
01:50:23 <strcat[m]> rny: for example, I met you online, your real life identity is not how I know you
01:50:50 <strcat[m]> if I met you irl if I wanted to verify something it's that it's the same person I know
01:52:38 <strcat[m]> seeing someone's supposed government issued ID and knowing their supposed legal name
01:52:42 <strcat[m]> doesn't make me trust them more
01:53:18 <strcat[m]> I don't sign people's GPG keys because I think it's a bunch of nonsense
01:53:49 <strcat[m]> and I don't think GPG is worth the attention of doing something like signing a bunch of keys to prove a point
01:54:21 <strcat[m]> people don't really use it aside from systems using it under the hood as an ugly implementation detail
02:11:39 <eric80> cannot get bootloader unlock phone- pixel4a?
02:12:46 <TheJollyRoger> eric80: What's going on?
02:13:50 <eric80> am trying to install grapheneos- am at point where phone is in fastboot mode but computer cannot see phone to unlock fastboot
02:14:06 <eric80> message is waiting for device
02:14:07 <TheJollyRoger> Windows, Linux, or MacOS?
02:14:13 <eric80> windows
02:16:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Yipes, someone was just in here with the same issue, but I'm out of ideas at the moment >_<.
02:16:09 <TheJollyRoger> Is device manager able to see it?
02:16:16 <TheJollyRoger> (While the phone's in fastboot?)
02:16:51 <eric80> yes but has a splat
02:17:05 <TheJollyRoger> Can device manager update the driver?
02:17:48 <eric80> not automatically
02:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> Let me search through the channel logs
02:22:56 <TheJollyRoger> Someone more knowledgeable than I is going to need to chip in on this, sorry >_<.
02:24:27 <rny> strcat[m]: you could execute a knowledge-based authentication protocol in the IRL meetup, once authenticated, you then sign the pgp public key that i give you
02:25:20 <Shane39> Hello
02:25:31 <seashield[m]> .
02:25:38 <rny> Shane39: hi
02:26:40 <Shane39> Hoping to get some assistance with a Graphene install.  Seems my device isn't being recogonized when I try to run the fastboot flashing unlock command
02:27:31 <pvelli> i installed graphene OS
02:27:40 <pvelli> it worked thru linux
02:27:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hey pvelli welcome back.
02:27:52 <pvelli> thanks
02:27:57 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear it worked on Linux, welcome aboard the ship!
02:28:09 <pvelli> btw, how come it still says google when it starts up, is that normals?
02:28:15 <pvelli> im guessing cuz its a google phone
02:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> Shane39: oh man, yipes, suddenly seems a lot of people are having the same issue.
02:28:40 <TheJollyRoger> pvelli: yeah, the "Google" screen you see when you first start up is burned into the phone's bootROM, it's not a part of GrapheneOS.
02:28:45 <TheJollyRoger> sorry,
02:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> not bootrom, Bootloader.
02:28:49 <pvelli> oh thank god
02:28:51 <TheJollyRoger> Which is signed and verified.
02:28:52 <pvelli> haha
02:28:55 <pvelli> thanks
02:29:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's normal. Your phone should display "Your device is loading a different operating system" in yellow text.
02:29:31 <TheJollyRoger> That's also normal too, because if it didn't, your phone would be loading the Google version of android.
02:29:47 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that screen turns orange and says "Software integrity is not guaranteed!" that you need to worry.
02:30:14 <TheJollyRoger> Shane39: eric80 hang on a moment, I might not be able to help you guys out since I'm not sure what's going on... might have to wait a bit for help >_<.
02:30:20 <Shane39> ok
02:32:54 <pvelli> hey at bootup if i uncheck the location permission of gathering data, i wont be able to use maps app right?
02:35:26 <rny> Shane39: what OS
02:35:32 <Shane39> Win10
02:35:47 <rny> Shane39: have you tried a different usb cable?
02:35:51 <rny> usb port?
02:36:22 <Shane39> yeah.  just got back from buying a USB a to C cable, and I tried the C to C cable that came with the phone
02:40:40 <Shane39> just sits here at "waiting for any device"
02:42:36 <pvelli> im trying to install f droid, but vinadium said "nah man, cuz security" is f-droid.org the official site?
02:43:06 <TheJollyRoger> pvelli: if you would like to sideload apps, you must add vanadium to the whitelist when it prompts.
02:44:40 <pvelli> ah true thanks
02:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> If you decide to install F-Droid or Aurora, you must similarly add them to the whitelist to sideload apps as well.
02:47:39 <pvelli> yup
02:48:28 <pvelli> btw if i use waze from aurora, i heard waze is actually google too
02:48:33 <rny> Shane39: have you tried different usb ports?
02:48:55 <rny> Shane39: you need to check if the PC actually picks up the device
02:49:18 <Shane39> yeah.  I tried both USB A ports.  Only have 1 C port
02:49:18 <rny> win10, iirc produces a jingle if the phone is connected
02:49:35 <rny> if the PC cant pick up the device, then its probably a hardware problem
02:49:41 <pvelli> Shane39 i dunno if you are having a similar problem as i had. But earlier fastboot on windows wasnt pickin up my device, i rebooted into linux and installed graphne no problem
02:50:12 <Shane39> going to restart my machine.  I'll be back
02:51:44 <pvelli> im super fascinated by how newpipe works
02:52:07 <pvelli> how the hell does it parse the site to play videos?
02:56:01 <eric80> downloading android usb driver cured problem with unlocking boot driver in windows.  woohoo up and running!!
02:56:13 <rny> pvelli: do finnicky stuff and run the js webapp to extract video URIs?
02:56:57 <rny> its offtopic btw
02:57:01 <pvelli> ah
02:57:03 <pvelli> shoot
03:07:28 <TheJollyRoger> eric80: whew! Glad to hear that worked! Welcome aboard the ship!
03:07:38 <TheJollyRoger> Don't forget to lock the bootloader!
03:10:10 <eric80> locked it- cant figure out how to include shane39 in the fix
03:14:41 <TheJollyRoger> He's disconnected from the chat, I'll let him know what your fix was when he gets back, thank you for letting me know!
03:15:36 <TheJollyRoger> I'm gonna go see if we need to add it to the instructions.
03:16:14 <eric80> Good deal.
03:30:08 <squairron[m]> What identifiers do apps I install use to make me unique and how can I reset them on Graphene?
03:32:03 <TheJollyRoger> squairron[m]: depends. For some legitimate use cases, it's your username.
03:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> Or rather, the user name you provide them.
03:32:36 <TheJollyRoger> For others:
03:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq#non-hardware-identifiers
03:33:45 <squairron[m]> Okay so just the account I use? I hope and is there a certain ID on the phone that all apps use to identify me? And if there is do I not have to worry about that on Graphene?
03:34:11 <squairron[m]> Oops I just saw the link you posted I will take a look too
03:34:15 <TheJollyRoger> Scroll to the previous answer about hardware identifiers: apps cannot extract hardware identifiers.
03:35:00 <squairron[m]> Okay thank you for the help!
03:35:41 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
03:52:17 <pvelli> Hey someone told me that grapheneos comes with nextdns preconfigured, im not seeing that to be the s
03:52:18 <pvelli> case
03:52:32 <somenerd[m]> it doesn't
03:53:01 <M1f4a9[m]> TheJollyRoger: In the archives I saw this remark by you: OEMs like Google actually have to pay qualcomm extra to have Qualcomm allow them to do user-provisionable verified boot keying.
03:53:12 <M1f4a9[m]> Is this certain or a rumor?
03:53:49 <rny> pvelli: no it does not come nextdns preconfigured
03:54:11 <TheJollyRoger> M1f4a9[m]: confirmed by one of the Google employees via Tweet, but I don't have the bookmark at the moment.
03:56:30 <M1f4a9[m]> Damn that sucks. Depending on how much it is and if per device or per license/line of devices, it would make it incredibly difficult to convince other vendors to do this.
03:58:06 <RamenLover> Hey is there a recommended network monitoring app on f droid?
03:58:09 <TheJollyRoger> M1f4a9[m]: yeah. I believe that the reason why Google pays extra to have user-provisionable bootloaders is because they want to do testing and development. The existence of open source projects like GrapheneOS that give back to upstream is worth it to them.
03:59:05 <somenerd[m]> also Google's an Android reference device
03:59:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:59:51 <M1f4a9[m]> Huawei and Samsung make phones with their own socs and could do it without paying extra, but these companies don't give a shit and are even hostile towards people that don't want their crap on their phones.
04:00:16 <M1f4a9[m]> And MediaTek is horrible with security.
04:02:26 <take_a_deep_brea> <RamenLover "Hey is there a recommended netwo"> Netguard . Although you cannot use the android VPN for anything else when Netguard is enabled.
04:04:03 <somenerd[m]> offtopic
04:04:18 <somenerd[m]> maybe move to offtopic if you want to continue on netguard
04:04:27 <take_a_deep_brea> <M1f4a9[m] "Huawei and Samsung make phones w"> Corporates are in _general_ funny that way . They are not built to give back anything . Nothing specific to software industry in this regard .
04:04:36 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah , sure .
04:05:08 <RamenLover> somenerd[m] do I create  new channel?
04:05:16 <somenerd[m]> no
04:05:26 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic
04:05:29 <RamenLover> What do you mean move to offtopic?
04:05:36 <somenerd[m]> join that channel
04:05:37 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao , no RamenLover:  there you go #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:05:44 <somenerd[m]> that's the matrix one
04:05:49 <somenerd[m]> they're on freenode
04:05:57 <somenerd[m]> so just #grapheneos-offtopic
04:06:02 <RamenLover> I see thanks
04:06:05 <take_a_deep_brea> i see
04:10:15 <M1f4a9[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "Corporates are in _general_ funn"> Samsung is just dumb because make most of their money on phone hardware sales and they can't get it through their thick heads that they'd sell more if people weren't tied to their shitty software/ecosystem.
04:10:45 <somenerd[m]> I feel that this is a bit offtopic
04:11:00 <deappledapple> Getting offtopic, for sure
04:11:11 <jameshandcockand> Off topic is two words
04:11:44 <M1f4a9[m]> I'm just brainstorming about possible alternatives to Pixels.
04:11:44 <somenerd[m]> yeah I write it like this due to the channel being #grapheneos-offtopic
04:13:48 <M1f4a9[m]> Complete reliance on Pixels and Google keeping the custom verified boot for Pixels isn't ideal.
04:14:16 <lucaszanella[m]> I've read about the plans to use virtualization and then in the future substitute the linux kernel by another kernel with a linux compatibility layer. How will the drivers work? Drivers use internal structures of the kernel. It's almost impossible to write a kernel compatible with the drivers without rewriting the entire linux kernel.
04:14:28 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS is planning to make custom hardware
04:14:47 <TheJollyRoger> Well, we hope in a distant future to.
04:14:55 <somenerd[m]> yeah
04:15:14 <M1f4a9[m]> That would be great, but given the size of the project I don't see that happening anytime soon.
04:15:21 <somenerd[m]> yeah
04:15:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:15:44 <lucaszanella[m]> <somenerd[m] "GrapheneOS is planning to make c"> Unless grapheneos creates the display, wifi, etc, I don't see how it would work since the manufacturer would probably just have drivers for linux
04:16:01 <somenerd[m]> I meant the message above
04:16:04 <somenerd[m]> not yours sorry
04:16:10 <lucaszanella[m]> oh ok
04:19:16 <M1f4a9[m]> There might be smaller Chinese companies that would be willing to make a GrapheneOS version of one of their existing products. Problem is that you would have to keep the base Android distribution up to date yourself, and just that probably takes a full time developer.
04:20:11 <somenerd[m]> people are welcome to try to build GrapheneOS for another device
04:20:46 <M1f4a9[m]> Without custom verified boot, it's not really GrapheneOS
04:21:08 <somenerd[m]> there are a few other requirements as well
04:21:11 <deappledapple> Also gotta take into account that relockable bootloader is not only the standards GrapheneOS  is looking for a hardware
04:21:18 <somenerd[m]> yeah
04:21:19 <lucaszanella[m]> <somenerd[m] "people are welcome to try to bui"> I'm planning on buying a Poco M3 to do that. I've been researching and reading grapheneOS, bought an SSD just for that, did a sucessful build
04:21:34 <somenerd[m]> might not have verified boot though
04:21:43 <somenerd[m]> or a lot of other security features
04:21:47 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
04:22:23 <lucaszanella[m]> <somenerd[m] "or a lot of other security featu"> I've chosen a cheap phone just to test and see what I can do. In the future maybe I can choose a better one (and more expensive)
04:22:27 <jameshandcockand> I feel like you should build a successful build for the Poco phone *before* you buy one
04:22:47 <jameshandcockand> So you know it can actually be done
04:23:26 <lucaszanella[m]> <jameshandcockand "I feel like you should build a s"> How would I know it works? I can build the kernel, integrate the kernel to the graphene build system, but nothing more than that. Am I right? I'd have to have the phone to do almost anything
04:23:55 <jameshandcockand> Get someone else who has one to try
04:24:06 <jameshandcockand> Are you an android developer?
04:24:29 <lucaszanella[m]> <jameshandcockand "Are you an android developer? "> I mean, I've had developed some aps, but I'm not an AOSP developer. I just want to try
04:26:57 <TheJollyRoger> lucaszanella[m]: Good luck man! I'm wanting to learn to develop stuff as well, learning experience!
04:27:10 <deappledapple> That's okay, it starts off as trying and figuring out stuffs there
04:27:24 <deappledapple> <TheJollyRoger "lucaszanella: Good luck man! I'm"> Yeah, good luck ^^
04:27:42 <lucaszanella[m]> Thanks everyone. I've been reading Gaphene's source for some days. It's going to take a while but I'm not gonna give up
04:27:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
04:34:14 <take_a_deep_brea> way to go lucaszanella: ! also , while you are at it , the various issue trackers may also benefit from your attention ( you too may , as its kind of a roadmap and will give you perspective ) https://grapheneos.org/contact#reporting-issues
05:40:47 <Thatcher[m]> I'm learning android development too in hopes of someday contributing to this project
10:10:48 <fuchser[m]> Hi Guys, I'm running graphene on my pixel3 and wonder if you guys have a good GCam port for me?
10:10:48 <fuchser[m]> i got one from https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/ but it crashes if i use the second selfi cam.
10:12:48 <take_a_deep_brea> fuchser:  this room is for discussion about grapheneOS system itself . discussion about apps dont take place here . however #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
10:12:55 <take_a_deep_brea> can be used to discuss about apps
10:13:45 <take_a_deep_brea> also the app you mentioned above , a gcam port is not supported so you at best can expect suggestions from other people in this toom and the off topic room
10:13:46 <fuchser[m]> ah, sorry and thanks!
10:13:53 <take_a_deep_brea> no sweat .
10:14:12 <take_a_deep_brea>  * also the app you mentioned above , a gcam port is not supported so you at best can expect suggestions from other people in this room and the off topic room
10:34:36 <jeronath[m]> Hello everybody ! I have installed graphene on pixel 4a a few months ago. Everything works fine except that I cannot use rpn mode with orbot. I am a newbie about these things, the different protocols and the connections between vpn orbot tor private dns etc. Do you know a good tuto for these things ? Somebody can help me ? I use expressvpn with orbot. thanks in advance. Nath a french guy (so sorry for my english😉)
10:42:12 <take_a_deep_brea> jeronath:  only one app can use Android VPN at a time. so either you can use expressVPN or orbot in VPN mode but not both at the same time
10:42:37 <take_a_deep_brea> you can still use orbot but not in its VPN mode
12:01:37 <rrr> hello everyone I m romain from France i m new here
12:02:10 <take_a_deep_brea> hello rrr:
12:02:36 <rrr> i learned only recently about privacy concerns via google and tried to install graphene os  as it seems really bad how our data are utilized
12:03:46 <rrr> Unfortunately  i run a youyube video tutorial to install on a pixel 3a. tutorial was good
12:04:12 <rrr> but my phone seems broken now i m stuck on "no commad"with a broken android robot image
12:09:33 <take_a_deep_brea> rrr: it is not the recommended way to install grapheneOS.
12:10:21 <take_a_deep_brea> you should follow this instead : https://grapheneos.org/install
12:11:32 <rrr> i unfortunately did follow the tutorial already my current issue from all the learning i have is that adb device is unauthorized but because i cannot log into my phone anymore i cannot authorize usb debugging
12:11:37 <take_a_deep_brea> * you should have followed these instructions nstead : https://grapheneos.org/install
12:12:00 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem.
12:12:19 <take_a_deep_brea> we can pick up from where your phone was left in a broken state
12:12:45 <take_a_deep_brea> but you need to tell us what you did till now step-by-step
12:13:04 <rrr> i can certainly details step by step. thanks a lot.
12:13:16 <take_a_deep_brea> that is the closest you can come to communicating the phones present state over a chat room
12:13:42 <take_a_deep_brea> could you send a link of that video ?
12:14:07 <rrr> yes i m going to detail everythin really broken down bear with me few seconds please
12:14:34 <rrr> 1 - the tutorial i sued was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6at2Dzay94
12:14:52 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem, rrr.
12:14:56 <rrr> 2 - to install adb on macos i used method one here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31374085/installing-adb-on-macos
12:15:14 <rrr> 3 - i have successfully installed and i could see my device
12:15:56 <rrr> 4 - i had downloaded the stable release for pixel 3a form the grapheneos here sargo-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
12:17:00 <rrr> 5 - i ran flash all. sh
12:18:17 <rrr> 6 - i have seen briefly seen on my phone a grapheneos  fastboot on my phone
12:18:43 <rrr> 7 - since i see fastboot mode product revision: sargo MP1.0 (ROW)
12:19:12 <rrr> bootlader version: b4s4-0.3.6863017
12:19:43 <rrr> baseland version: g670-00084-201008-b-6891501
12:20:13 <rrr> serial number: 0AGAYS0106H
12:20:21 <rrr> secure boot: PRODUCTION
12:20:29 <rrr> NOS production:yes
12:20:46 <rrr> DRAM: 4GB Micron LPDDR4X
12:20:54 <rrr> eMMC: 64GB Micron
12:20:59 <rrr> Device state: unlocked
12:21:06 <rrr> Boot slot: A
12:21:15 <rrr> Enter reason: no valid slot to boot
12:21:20 <rrr> and i m stuck there
12:23:34 <deappledapple> <rrr "2 - to install adb on macos i us"> Um... The source of platform tools caused it
12:23:58 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
12:24:07 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
12:24:43 * deappledapple sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QdHYaoNNOynDjXYkLKwOZRFm/message.txt >
12:25:37 <deappledapple> Unfortunately, gonna start over and reflash it, this time using the updated platform-tools, good luck :)
12:26:07 <rrr> reason why i did it is because this video is kind of how i learned about grapheneos
12:26:49 <rrr> now unfortunately i cannot reflash my issue is i should need to access  the phone to authorize any computer but i cannot access the phone anymore
12:27:06 <rrr> if i could i would love to use the updated platform tools oyu mentioned
12:27:19 <deappledapple> <rrr "now unfortunately i cannot refla"> If you can reboot to bootloader, you can still reflash
12:27:30 <take_a_deep_brea> they should be able to
12:28:00 <rrr> i was assuming because adb tells me
12:28:02 <rrr> List of devices attached
12:28:02 <rrr> 0AGAYS0106H	unauthorized
12:28:17 <rrr> so i was thinking my first move would be to change it to authorized
12:28:19 <take_a_deep_brea> rrr:  adb is unnecesary for installation
12:28:25 <rrr> ok !
12:28:31 <rrr> i ll start from scratch then
12:28:44 <take_a_deep_brea> what we need is the fastboot to work
12:29:18 <take_a_deep_brea> just follow the official instructions to the letter and you will have graphene running in no time .
12:29:59 <take_a_deep_brea> make sure that your setup fulfills all the requirements listed in the https://grapheneos.org/install
12:33:05 <rrr> hey i m reading all the installation page entirely. i do not understand everything as i m not advanced person  and it s first time i m using common line but it looks well detailed !
12:33:11 <rrr> my setup is compliant yes
12:34:42 <deappledapple> It's copy paste friendly pretty much
12:35:12 <deappledapple> Except for the images, just change sunfish to sargo, as you have sargo images
12:35:26 <rrr> yes it helps to feel comfortable and also i feel i m learning stufff
12:35:51 <rrr> where are you guys from ? USA ?  thanks anyway for the support
12:36:00 <rrr> also how can i tip the community ?
12:36:03 <rrr> i want to
12:36:16 <deappledapple> Various places
12:36:44 <deappledapple> Donate to GrapheneOS here:
12:36:44 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/donate
12:37:14 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Except for the images, just chan"> Rather, you have Pixel 3a
12:38:05 <rrr> i ve just made a donation via paypal thanks

12:56:30 <rrr> on the terminal on my ocmputer it looks finished but the phone shows me a big warning sign fastoot mode
12:56:43 <rrr> and at the bottom enter reason:reboot bootloader
12:57:38 <deappledapple> Looks normal
12:58:25 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/install#locking-the-bootloader would be last step before post-installation
12:59:33 <rrr> yes i was looking at this one but don t get it because installaiton guide says i should do form bootloader interface
12:59:57 <rrr> but it only tells me: the bootloader is unlocked ....
13:00:04 <rrr> i have no button to chage
13:00:09 <rrr> i can only launch graphenos

13:02:22 <rrr> no i did not managed
13:02:32 <rrr> i arrived on the graphene logo
13:03:04 <rrr> when i type in terminal fastboot flashing lock
13:03:05 <rrr> nothing happens
13:03:26 <deappledapple> Yeah, because you're not in bootloader
13:04:05 <deappledapple> reboot back to bootloader
13:04:06 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/install#locking-the-bootloader
13:05:23 <deappledapple> Did rrr left?
13:05:34 <rrr> never
13:05:51 <rrr> i would first thank you all and i also would stay to help future people like me
13:06:07 <rrr> i m just trying to figure out how to arrive to bootloader again
13:06:22 <deappledapple> Power button + volume down button
13:06:45 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Power button + volume down butto"> Advise to shut down the phone, wait for a while before doing this
13:08:22 <rrr> ok now im in bootloader
13:09:01 <rrr> but the only options are barcode/rescue mode/recovery mode/restart bootloader/start /power off
13:09:12 <rrr> nothing offering me to lock again

13:10:05 <rrr> yeah whatever i type in the terminal does nothing
13:10:13 <rrr> it like it turned into a text editor
13:10:16 <rrr> i m gonna reopen
13:10:18 <deappledapple> Just to double check, is your device detected, or is the fastboot there:
13:10:18 <deappledapple> fastboot --version
13:10:18 <deappledapple> fastboot devices
13:10:40 <rrr> no nothing happens in the terminal
13:10:44 <deappledapple> <rrr "i m gonna reopen"> You have to reset the $PATH if you do
13:10:54 <rrr> ok let me go back to that
13:13:38 <rrr> i locked it now i do have a warning message device loading different system and i arrive on grapheneos
13:14:04 <deappledapple> <rrr "i locked it now i do have a warn"> That's much better
13:14:12 <deappledapple> <rrr "i locked it now i do have a warn"> That's normal for locked bootloader
13:14:44 <rrr> ok it looks i m all set

16:21:25 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> 🤔 I'll look at scrollback

16:24:47 <hypokeimenon[m]> By the way, searching 'waiting for any device' in the room is a bit alarming.

16:27:10 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: sounds like the issue is you don't have working internet access
16:27:30 <strcat[m]> you need working internet access for it to check for updates and update
16:27:36 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: maybe you're using a broken network or VPN
16:27:43 <strcat[m]> maybe you're using a broken DNS configuration
16:27:46 <strcat[m]> up to you to figure out what's broken
16:28:02 <strcat[m]> I would suggest using the option to reset network settings in the Settings app
16:28:18 <strcat[m]> and reconnect to the network
16:28:33 <Washipp> Hello
16:28:33 <Washipp> First time joining, any rules or just the normal "dont be an asshole"?
16:28:46 <strcat[m]> jonf3n:  the OS is informing you that you don't have working network access
16:28:51 <strcat[m]> so, fix that
16:29:00 <strcat[m]>  * jonf3n:  the OS is informing you that you don't have working internet access
16:30:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Washipp "First time joining, any rules or"> Yeah, pretty much. Off topic chatter goes in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org and look up https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210120 or the Graphene OS F.A.Q. for any topics that have already been discussed
16:32:20 <frontman[m]1> Feature request: a second password that resets phone and a limit on password attempts then phone wipes (but not like with a cloth). 🙂
16:32:58 <Washipp> I haven't really found any infos on the Pixel 4a 5G except the notes in the FAQ. Are there any infos on support right now?
16:34:30 <strcat[m]> covered in the FAQ
16:34:36 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
16:34:43 <strcat[m]> sounds more like you're unhappy with the answer
16:34:49 <strcat[m]> you won't get a different answer here though
16:35:30 <strcat[m]> frontman: the OS already supports a limit on # of attempts but I suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
16:35:35 <strcat[m]> and considering what you expect that to accomplish
16:35:45 <strcat[m]> if an attacker can exploit the OS, a limit on # of attempts implemented by the OS doesn't do anything
16:36:06 <strcat[m]> frontman: so, I don't understand in what threat model that would be a useful feature
16:36:17 <strcat[m]> please read the section on encryption first
16:36:34 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <hypokeimenon[m] "^"> That worked, thanks
16:36:39 <strcat[m]> particularly the info on how attempts to derive the key are already throttled to 1 / day
16:36:49 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Would it make sense to use signify in WSL?
16:36:55 <strcat[m]> by the secure element
16:37:04 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: no, not really
16:37:26 <jonathancross> <strcat[m] "I would suggest using the option"> I reset networking, but still get the "Limited connection" warning.
16:37:35 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: yeah, so figure out why, and fix that
16:37:39 <strcat[m]> it's not an Updater issue
16:37:40 <strcat[m]> it's a network issue
16:37:50 <strcat[m]> the Updater won't run if the OS doesn't think there's working internet
16:37:57 <strcat[m]> neither will anything else that has a constraint on having working internet
16:38:08 <strcat[m]> updates are done as part of a scheduled job depending on internet access
16:38:15 <strcat[m]> if the OS is telling you that your internet access is broken, you need to fix that
16:38:28 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe they can sideload update for time being ?
16:38:37 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: disable VPN if you have one, turn off any weird filtering on your network, make sure your DNS works
16:38:45 <strcat[m]> it's not an updater issue
16:38:47 <strcat[m]> it's an internet issue
16:38:55 <strcat[m]> if they sideload the update they'll still have broken internet
16:39:09 <strcat[m]> the update client isn't the only thing not running for them
16:39:46 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah , their network settings is the issue , that will get carried over .
16:40:34 <jonathancross> I just realized that the date was wrong and it was not being updated from network (despite 500Mbps connection on device).
16:40:35 <jonathancross> Fixing that manually has triggered the update.
16:40:48 <take_a_deep_brea> i was just saying they could may be update first as it seems to be quiet some time since thehy updated
16:41:00 <take_a_deep_brea> oh nevermind , me
16:41:09 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: well that makes sense, you didn't have working HTTPS
16:41:15 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: although the time updates should have corrected that
16:41:25 <strcat[m]> but I think atm the time updates can be broken by the time being incorrect
16:41:28 <strcat[m]> ideally rny can take a look at that
16:41:42 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to ignore the time set on the device for network time updates
16:41:44 <strcat[m]> but I don't think it is
16:41:45 <strcat[m]> help wanted
16:43:29 <jonathancross> <strcat[m] "jonf3n: well that makes sense, y"> I still don't know why wifi is acting strange, other devices (laptop, pixel2) are working fine and clearly the connection works (vanadium at least).
16:44:19 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: sounds like you found the issue already
16:44:30 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: you said your time was set incorrectly, that means HTTPS wouldn't have been working properly
16:45:07 <strcat[m]> jonf3n: time has to be set correctly for encrypted connections using certificates / keys with start and end dates for validity to work
16:45:21 <strcat[m]> if your time is set to 3 months ago, then any certificates created after that point won't be considered valid
16:45:30 <strcat[m]> if your time is set to 3 months from now, a bunch of stuff will be considered expired
16:45:35 <strcat[m]> it's quite important to have the correct time
16:45:46 <strcat[m]> the OS tests whether HTTP and HTTPS work
16:45:56 <strcat[m]> it was telling you that it wasn't all working in an urgent notification
16:46:06 <strcat[m]> that was the error message you needed to address
16:51:52 <jonathancross> <strcat[m] "jonf3n: sounds like you found th"> After updating the OS, I am not seeing the Wifi connection problem message anymore... hopefully that stays :-)
16:55:47 <came2complain[m]> Good evening everybody
16:57:27 <take_a_deep_brea> good evening came2complain:  . any complaints ?
16:57:40 <came2complain[m]> yeah... fuck that lockdown
16:57:51 <came2complain[m]> what a damn year we've had ha?
16:58:57 <take_a_deep_brea> well  its been abnormal , yes . on the other hand , do you have anything grapheneOS specific ?
16:59:42 <came2complain[m]> yes - I'd like to know what it takes to avoid the google complain about loading a different OS - I assume it's because the OS isn't signed with googles key?
17:00:00 <strcat[m]> use a phone built to run GrapheneOS as the stock OS
17:00:11 <came2complain[m]> since there doesn't seem to be a bypass I assume the bootloader isn't open source?
17:00:11 <strcat[m]> so, start by making one
17:00:14 <strcat[m]> and use that
17:00:17 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
17:00:29 <strcat[m]> came2complain: it has nothing to do with open or closed source
17:00:39 <strcat[m]> the Qualcomm EDK2 bootloader is open source
17:00:48 <strcat[m]> came2complain: the device has verified boot, and GrapheneOS is not the stock OS
17:01:01 <strcat[m]> on any device that is not made to run GrapheneOS as the stock OS, that notice will be there
17:01:05 <came2complain[m]> that's the plan. I intend to copy the hw ingredients of the pixel 3a 1 to 1 - but I am sure I can't use the Titan M so I wonder if it can be replaced with a tpm from STM
17:01:13 <strcat[m]> on a device made to run GrapheneOS as the stock OS, that notice will be there if you run anything else
17:01:20 <strcat[m]> came2complain: no, a TPM has no use
17:01:31 <strcat[m]> doesn't implement any relevant APIs, doesn't have the required capabilities
17:01:47 <came2complain[m]> I'd like to prototype a device specifically built to run grapheneOS
17:01:47 <strcat[m]> I'm also unsure why you would copy a Pixel 3a
17:01:52 <came2complain[m]> couldn't find any yet
17:02:18 <strcat[m]> you're free to work on that
17:02:41 <strcat[m]> a device made to run GrapheneOS will have that same notice when running an OS other than GrapheneOS including a custom build of it
17:02:49 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to be there
17:03:15 <strcat[m]> has nothing to do with open vs. closed source
17:03:35 <came2complain[m]> well some part of the device must expect another OS
17:03:44 <strcat[m]> if you theoretically made an open hardware SoC and entirely open hardware for every single other component that notice will still be there when running anything but the stock OS
17:03:49 <came2complain[m]> that part could be changed if it was possible?
17:03:54 <strcat[m]> came2complain: and it has nothing to do with open vs. closed source
17:04:15 <strcat[m]> came2complain: yes, make a new device that has a different key (an official GrapheneOS key) for the stock OS
17:04:15 <came2complain[m]> can you please explain what part exactly is responsible for that denial?
17:04:30 <strcat[m]> the verified boot implementation
17:05:00 <strcat[m]> the late stage bootloader is responsible for verifying the core OS and handing off verification responsibility for the rest of the OS to it
17:05:25 <strcat[m]> when running anything but the stock OS via a custom verified boot key, it will show that notice, as part of the implementation
17:05:31 <take_a_deep_brea> came2complain:  thats not a denial . more of a warning , rarely seen by anybody other than people who should know what they are doing if they reached that screen
17:05:34 <strcat[m]> when you flash GrapheneOS on a device, it flashes the custom verified boot key
17:05:50 <strcat[m]> when you're using a custom verified boot key, that notice is shown
17:05:59 <strcat[m]> a device made to run GrapheneOS would work exactly the same way
17:06:09 <strcat[m]> the difference is that GrapheneOS official releases would be the stock OS
17:06:23 <came2complain[m]> and there is no way to change the expected key in the verified boot implementation of the pixel phones because that part can't be modified to expect the Graphene OS key - correct?
17:06:47 <strcat[m]> it would be a security vulnerability if you could bypass verified boot
17:06:51 <strcat[m]> and as I said, a device made to run GrapheneOS would work the same way
17:07:04 <came2complain[m]> Ok
17:07:06 <strcat[m]> if you replaced the official releases of GrapheneOS with another OS with a custom verified boot key, you would see that notice on boot
17:07:12 <came2complain[m]> I understood that.
17:07:28 <came2complain[m]> So the part is implemented by the hw vendor
17:07:30 <strcat[m]> it would be a security vulnerability with a substantial reward available if you found a verified boot bypass
17:08:01 <strcat[m]> each phone has a build of the late stage bootloader with the stock OS verified boot key set in it
17:08:17 <strcat[m]> if the phone supports custom verified boot keys, it has an implementation of dealing with those
17:08:47 <strcat[m]> if a phone was built to run GrapheneOS, we would be signing the firmware and it would be our key configured in the code
17:09:08 <came2complain[m]> ok
17:09:09 <strcat[m]> came2complain: I suggest looking at the Qualcomm EDK2 bootloader source code
17:09:22 <strcat[m]> you can see how this is configured and used
17:09:41 <came2complain[m]> I assume the Titan-M can't be purchased from google to be used in non-google products?
17:09:45 <strcat[m]> if we had our own device, we would have our own build of that set
17:09:52 <strcat[m]> came2complain: it's not available for purchase
17:10:04 <strcat[m]> another secure element would need to be used
17:10:10 <strcat[m]> implementing the APIs used by the OS
17:10:31 <strcat[m]> you cannot just use some arbitrary secure element with random APIs not used by the OS
17:10:31 <came2complain[m]> any recommendation?
17:10:38 <strcat[m]> a TPM has no use and doesn't have the necessary capabilities
17:10:43 <strcat[m]> I don't have a recommendation
17:11:00 <strcat[m]> you would need a secure element where you can put your own firmware or at least applets on it
17:11:13 <strcat[m]> and you'd need to implement the required APIs
17:11:46 <strcat[m]> Weaver, firmware updates with insider attack resistance, enforcement of bootloader / verified boot state, StrongBox keymaster (the largest portion of the APIs) including stuff like secure input
17:12:25 <strcat[m]> also I don't see any reason to copy the Pixel 3a - it's a past generation device, and there is no reason you have to copy the specs of any Pixel phone
17:13:11 <strcat[m]> you need hardware with proper fully functional AOSP support complying with the usual CDD/CTS requirements including providing the recommended security features, not just mandatory ones
17:13:26 <strcat[m]> no reason to copy Pixel specs specifically
17:15:06 <strcat[m]> so, for example, if it was an upcoming device, it would probably be using the Snapdragon 888, a bunch of memory (more than Pixels), a secure element implementing those things (Qualcomm SPU may not be capable of doing it - unclear), all the components properly configured with IOMMU containment (SoC is handled for you), etc.
17:15:06 <came2complain[m]> I assumed that there would be less work to do if the hw is the same as the one in the pixel
17:15:16 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3a is a legacy device
17:15:21 <came2complain[m]> besides the verified boot implementation and the secure module
17:15:36 <strcat[m]> a reference platform has working verified boot
17:15:46 <strcat[m]> you won't be implementing that yourself
17:16:02 <strcat[m]> you would at most be implementing secure element based storage of state
17:17:05 <strcat[m]> unless you're planning on doing something very strange, the assumption is that you're using an existing mobile SoC with the vendor provided AOSP support
17:17:30 <strcat[m]> a secure element matching Pixels is outside the scope of what they would provide
17:17:44 <strcat[m]> verified boot support is mandatory and not something you have to make
17:18:02 <came2complain[m]> ok I want a secure element in the device
17:18:21 <strcat[m]> unclear which SoC vendors provide working support for alternative verified boot keys out-of-the-box but verified boot itself is mandatory and standard
17:18:22 <came2complain[m]> it's one of the main reasons why pixels are more secure than other android devices isn't it?
17:18:38 <came2complain[m]> so there'd be the hardest work to do I guess
17:18:40 <strcat[m]> and a device meant for running GrapheneOS doesn't necessarily need to support running another OS, it's a design decision to make
17:18:52 <strcat[m]> there could be development and production variants
17:19:06 <strcat[m]> with production only supporting GrapheneOS itself
17:19:17 <strcat[m]> Pixels use the same devices for production and development once they reach the production stage
17:19:30 <strcat[m]> not mandatory to do things that way
17:21:29 <strcat[m]> came2complain: Pixels are set up as secure production devices with proper security updates provided monthly, and they provide the recommended security features from the CDD along with other improvements over what's mandatory
17:21:35 <strcat[m]> came2complain: they also have full support for the hardware security features for an alternate OS
17:21:40 <strcat[m]> which is quite unique
17:22:10 <strcat[m]> and they get day 1 updates to new major OS versions for the device as a whole
17:23:17 <strcat[m]> and they deal with other things like providing Wi-FI anonymity which may require custom requests for component vendors
17:24:37 <strcat[m]> having a proper device created to run GrapheneOS will require substantial resources - money, developers, partnerships with companies
17:24:48 <strcat[m]> it's not something someone is going to do on their own
17:25:42 <strcat[m]> need to work with a competent hardware partner
17:26:39 <strcat[m]> baseline is essentially a Qualcomm SoC reference device with the latest, highest end SoC
17:26:59 <came2complain[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not something someone is go"> I know
17:27:02 <strcat[m]> the Qualcomm SPU may be able to satisfy the secure element requirements but I'm skeptical about it currently meeting the requirements
17:27:15 <came2complain[m]> MediaTek not sufficient?
17:27:21 <came2complain[m]> They're easier to source
17:27:31 <strcat[m]> they've historically had really bad security
17:27:59 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense for us to produce a device that has substantially worse security
17:28:14 <strcat[m]> I don't think they have a competitive platform on the security front
17:28:17 <strcat[m]> and I don't see them having one
17:28:21 <came2complain[m]> ok
17:28:30 <came2complain[m]> STSAFE-A100 an option for the secure element?
17:28:35 <strcat[m]> the goal is not producing a device but producing a device that is at least as secure as a Pixel
17:29:33 <came2complain[m]> During the Trump administration the Chinese HW partners that would have been able to provide the necessary AOSP support weren't allowed to source Qualcomm Chipsets
17:30:05 <came2complain[m]> they always asked said they can only provide MediaTek
17:30:12 <strcat[m]> afaik only Huawei was forbidden from working with US companies
17:30:48 <strcat[m]> pretty sure there are manufacturers elsewhere including Taiwan, South Korea, India, etc.
17:30:54 <came2complain[m]> Trust me we couldn't source qualcomm from the Chinese partners that usually were able to provide this kind of solutions
17:31:05 <came2complain[m]> in the low volumes we require
17:32:01 <strcat[m]> low volume is a major assumption, I think if we were producing a device to run GrapheneOS we would be able to sell far more of them, and small tasks like implementing an app install / update system with our own repo, etc. would be easy to deal with
17:32:08 <strcat[m]> to make the OS more suitable for non-technical people
17:32:45 <came2complain[m]> yes
17:32:54 <came2complain[m]> that's the goal
17:33:13 <strcat[m]> seems to be a company that actually made a truly secure device at least as secure as Pixels and got the endorsements that it would get would be higher volume than Pixels themselves
17:33:38 <strcat[m]> but as soon as a company starts making compromises like using MediaTek, using an older generation SoC, not having a comparable secure element, etc.
17:33:45 <strcat[m]> I lose interest and it wouldn't have official GrapheneOS support
17:34:11 <strcat[m]> I want it to launch with a current SoC, a high end one, and a bunch of memory, we struggle with the current amount of available memory due to hardened_malloc + exec spawning
17:34:17 <came2complain[m]> that's why I'm here asking questions :D
17:34:28 <strcat[m]> proper secure element providing the same APIs as Pixels
17:34:46 <strcat[m]> and if we wanted we could add extensions
17:34:52 <strcat[m]> so, for example, see https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption about what baseline Weaver does
17:37:24 <strcat[m]> came2complain: what I want is basically a Qualcomm reference device with the highest end SoC, a ton of memory, comparable secure element, properly set up as a secure production device like Pixels (secure IOMMU configuration for peripheral components, etc.)
17:37:42 <strcat[m]> came2complain: where we control it as an OEM, our keys are the OEM keys for firmware, etc.
17:38:00 <came2complain[m]> find me the secure element
17:38:05 <came2complain[m]> the rest shouldn't be an issue
17:38:17 <strcat[m]> came2complain: and then we can build on that, such as having a sensors off kill switch turning off cameras, microphones, all the accelerometer/gyroscope/compass/proximity sensor type things, etc.
17:38:33 <strcat[m]> wire speakers in a way that they can't be used as mics
17:38:35 <came2complain[m]> to be honest I don't want gps present
17:38:38 <came2complain[m]> or front camera
17:38:43 <came2complain[m]> for the base model
17:38:51 <strcat[m]> well we want that
17:38:53 <strcat[m]> we want a normal usable device
17:38:54 <came2complain[m]> I'd go even the Snowden way and not put internal mics in
17:38:57 <strcat[m]> I don't see the issue with a GPSD
17:39:00 <strcat[m]>  * I don't see the issue with a GPS
17:39:05 <strcat[m]> came2complain: that's not what we want
17:39:14 <strcat[m]> we want a sensors off switch to disable input to the device
17:39:29 <strcat[m]> but the GPS thing is hard to understand
17:39:39 <came2complain[m]> then let's do a base model with what you want and a more paranoid model with what I want :D
17:39:39 <strcat[m]> you can determine location with cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
17:39:45 <strcat[m]> or even audio recording, etc.
17:39:50 <strcat[m]> came2complain: I don't want any security theater
17:39:59 <strcat[m]> if you have an accelerometer that's a microphone
17:40:05 <strcat[m]> if you have Wi-Fi / cellular, that's location tracking
17:40:09 <strcat[m]> audio recording is usable for location tracking too
17:40:25 <came2complain[m]> no need for an accelerometer imho
17:40:25 <strcat[m]> a sensors off switch makes sense
17:40:32 <strcat[m]> came2complain: it has to be a usable device
17:40:50 <strcat[m]> we don't want to make some niche thing without standard functionality and it should satisfy the CDD / CTS requirements
17:40:54 <came2complain[m]> My 2 model approach could satisfy everyone
17:41:01 <strcat[m]> no
17:41:05 <strcat[m]> we want 1 model of phone
17:41:32 <strcat[m]> and we won't be involved in anything security theater stuff
17:44:01 <strcat[m]> just have a hardware switch disabling audio recording - which includes turning off cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, compass, etc. because you can use all those things for audio recording
17:44:10 <strcat[m]> so, a sensors off switch
17:44:25 <strcat[m]> people use front cameras a lot including for video calling
17:44:55 <Albakham[m]> Doesn't make sense to want a unusable phone, the more paranoid approach is simply to not own a phone
17:45:19 <strcat[m]> just give people a case that covers it if they don't want it usable at all, or have a separate switch for it, but that makes things more complicated
17:45:29 <strcat[m]> and I don't want separate switches for things that do not accomplish anything
17:45:40 <strcat[m]> so for example, a microphone kill switch by itself that doesn't prevent audio recording isn't wanted
17:45:53 <strcat[m]> it should be based on meaningful semantics not implementation details
17:46:03 <strcat[m]> a GPS kill switch makes no sense - you don't need GPS to determine location
17:46:04 <strcat[m]> in fact
17:46:10 <strcat[m]> as people encounter when using location on GrapheneOS
17:46:16 <strcat[m]> GPS really sucks at quickly determining location
17:46:24 <strcat[m]> and barely works / doesn't work inside, etc.
17:46:35 <came2complain[m]> ok
17:46:49 <came2complain[m]> hw killswitch isn't that easy to implement
17:46:55 <strcat[m]> and I don't see a point in not including useful sensors when we can support disabling them
17:47:05 <strcat[m]> came2complain:  seems easy enough
17:47:34 <strcat[m]> if phones weren't so fragile and packed together with barely any room inside I could even see retrofitting them onto an existing device
17:47:43 <strcat[m]> but it's impractical to even take apart a phone
17:48:02 <came2complain[m]> STSAFE-A100 ?
17:48:12 <came2complain[m]> we need the secure element
17:48:17 <strcat[m]> came2complain: don't know anything about that
17:48:26 <came2complain[m]> the rest can be sourced
17:48:34 <strcat[m]> yes need a secure element that supports custom firmware or at least applets
17:48:44 <strcat[m]> and it needs to be able to support insider attack resistance for firmware upgrades
17:48:48 <strcat[m]> and it has to be a high quality secure element
17:49:08 <strcat[m]> also speakers need to be wired in a way that prevents using them as a mic
17:49:15 <strcat[m]> don't know what that involves
17:49:21 <strcat[m]> I'm not an electronics engineer
17:50:16 <came2complain[m]> If we want to achieve a level of security equal or greater than the pixels, we won't get around a proper secure element
17:50:33 <strcat[m]> sure
17:50:42 <strcat[m]> maybe the Qualcomm SPU on the Snapdragon 888 has advanced to the point that it is usable for it
17:50:45 <strcat[m]> I don't know
17:50:56 <strcat[m]> if it doesn't have a way to do insider attack resistance for firmware upgrades, it hasn't
17:50:57 <came2complain[m]> who knows?
17:51:00 <came2complain[m]> :D
17:51:02 <strcat[m]> and if it doesn't have a secure timer, it can't do Weaver
17:51:50 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: what do you think about the "modular phone" idea? Google had a project, forgot the name, about this...
17:52:08 <strcat[m]> opposite of what we want
17:52:15 <came2complain[m]> "Project Ara"
17:52:18 <COVID-1984> The chip/embedded experts I talked to in the valley all insisted it is a stupid idea "cuz we gotta make stuff as small & cheap as possible"
17:52:24 <strcat[m]> if anything we want to pair components like the screen like Apple
17:52:34 <COVID-1984> but I like the lego-like / desktop-computer-like idea for phones
17:53:00 <strcat[m]> if we make our own phones I expect it to be expensive and tamper resistant
17:53:21 <strcat[m]> it would be serving a specific purpose
17:53:26 <COVID-1984> The "not able to work on your own phone" seems like security via obscurity
17:53:39 <COVID-1984> like if there's a HW bug in the security chip, you could replace it
17:53:44 <strcat[m]> in what sense?
17:53:45 <COVID-1984> and the people who don't care much could just keep it
17:53:46 <strcat[m]> look at Auditor
17:53:56 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: ????
17:54:12 <COVID-1984> Right Project Ara
17:54:15 <COVID-1984> I liked that idea
17:54:29 <COVID-1984> I think it will emerge naturally if hobbyists start building phones more
17:54:42 <strcat[m]> if the phone has a hardware backdoor it's pretty crazy to think you should be just replacing a component and still using it
17:54:47 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: yeah, which is fine, and it's the opposite of what we want
17:54:56 <strcat[m]> if the secure element is a separate chip, it needs to be paired with the SoC
17:55:06 <strcat[m]> by definition it can't just be a drop in chip
17:55:11 <strcat[m]> how is it paired then?
17:55:16 <COVID-1984> you could actually look into hardware backdoors as a hobbyist without having loads of expensive equipment & time
17:55:36 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: sure, each discrete unit would make sense
17:55:37 <Albakham[m]> <COVID-1984 "like if there's a HW bug in the "> Being able to replace the security chip kills the goal of the security cjip
17:55:42 <COVID-1984> it wouldn't be like the smallest parts broken down
17:55:45 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound realistic to me
17:55:50 <COVID-1984> you'd have to replace SoC + some stuff as a block
17:55:51 <COVID-1984> like a lego
17:56:06 <Albakham[m]> * Being able to replace the security chip kills the goal of the security chip
17:56:09 <strcat[m]> I would prefer it if an attacker couldn't easily open up the phone and replace the screen with a malicious one etc.
17:56:22 <strcat[m]> the goal would not be making a general purpose mainstream device but rather a hardened one
17:56:22 <COVID-1984> Albakham[m]: if replacing teh chip kills security, then good luck if anyone has the money to replace your soldiered on chip
17:56:36 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: it doesn't kill the security
17:56:38 <strcat[m]> the point is that it doesn't work
17:56:42 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: it would be much harder because phones wouldn't be so identical
17:56:46 <strcat[m]> you bricked the phone
17:57:03 <COVID-1984> right now they could just replace the whole phone and you'd try to unlock it with your face/finger/code - and it would send it to them, they'd use it on your real phone :)
17:57:20 <strcat[m]> if you take the Titan M from one Pixel and swap it with another you bricked it if the batch keys are different
17:57:32 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: right, that's what I was trying to say to Albakham[m]
17:57:52 <strcat[m]> you could swap it back and unbrick it... but you can't just replace it
17:58:00 <COVID-1984> Not saying to get rid of that particular approach. I'm definitely not saying "modularity above everything"
17:58:25 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: right so FBI can swap and unbrick our pixels?
17:58:27 <strcat[m]> ok imagine a Pixel but the pairing isn't just between the secure element and SoC
17:58:44 <strcat[m]> but also the SoC and SSD, SoC and touchscreen, SoC and camera modules
17:58:57 <strcat[m]> etc
17:59:16 <strcat[m]> I don't want to make a modular device or a repairable device, it's not the goal for us
17:59:23 <COVID-1984> ya not trying to convince you
17:59:33 <COVID-1984> was just hoping someone with more knowledge would steelman my idea :)
18:00:02 <COVID-1984> because it is intuitive to me... and I know it doesn't necessitate bad security
18:01:13 <billzster> Hi Folks - Trying to secure my GraphenOS the best I can =. Question if I download an app from say Aurora that has tracker/logger on it but I disable all permissions - including "Network". Is it safe to use the app with confidence that it can not communicate with outside parties. Ex: "Nova Launcher" uses Google Firebase. Also can someone suggest an
18:01:13 <billzster> app to monitor what app traffic is being used.
18:01:30 <strcat[m]> and based around the assumption that it would be initially very low volume
18:01:42 <strcat[m]> and we'd still want to be using high end hardware, for security reasons
18:01:44 <strcat[m]> it would be expensive
18:02:02 <strcat[m]> billzster: GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services / Firebase stuff
18:02:30 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: yes very hard to get started... Would love to see blogs from some ex-chip-fab engineers
18:02:38 <strcat[m]> billzster: those kinds of "tracker" notices are highly misleading and inaccurate
18:02:52 <strcat[m]> billzster: you need to understand that what it does is detecting common third party SDKs which they have deemed to be tracking, often quite arbitrarily
18:03:15 <COVID-1984> Someone can just build the tools, then build a car with those tools... but for a chip, they have to build tools to make a shitty chip and slowly iterate it seems... building each set of tools along the way... now I wonder about TSMC's chip fab tools
18:03:18 <strcat[m]> billzster: it being present in the app as a library doesn't imply that the app always uses it, and doesn't imply it uses the functionality that has been deemed to be tracking
18:03:19 <COVID-1984> probably impossible to buy
18:03:34 <strcat[m]> billzster: and an app certainly doesn't need to use one of those common 3rd party SDKs to do something you would consider privacy-violating
18:03:47 <strcat[m]> they can do that entirely on their own... they don't need help from a 3rd party library
18:03:52 <strcat[m]> billzster: it's a misguided approach
18:04:04 <strcat[m]> if you don't trust the app, doesn't use it as your launcher
18:04:13 <strcat[m]>  * if you don't trust the app, don't use it as your launcher
18:04:25 <strcat[m]> best practice would be using the standard GrapheneOS launcher
18:05:06 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: cars have computers in them and can't simply be built / worked on to the same extent as 30 years ago
18:06:48 <billzster> Never knew that strcat[m]  very informative. Thank you. Is the statement true though if I use an app and block all permissions the certainly it would be more secure or can an app thats blocked still communicate outside in another way.
18:07:01 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: ya but you get my analogy
18:07:07 <COVID-1984> "car without computer" :P
18:07:17 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: also there's a lot less that can go wrong with a non-ICE car so most fixes would probably involve stuff that involves computers
18:07:24 <strcat[m]>  * COVID-1984: also there's a lot less that can physically go wrong with a non-ICE car so most fixes would probably involve stuff that involves computers
18:07:26 <somenerd[m]> imo you shouldn’t use the app then
18:07:44 <somenerd[m]> (If you don’t trust it)
18:07:52 <somenerd[m]> Even with all perms disabled
18:08:03 <strcat[m]> so for example, good luck working on a Tesla yourself - but you can expect every other car to end up that way
18:08:24 <billzster> I dont trust my self but I still have to operate. But yeah I get it
18:08:30 <strcat[m]> billzster: an app can play audio by default if it's in the foreground, there's a way to communicate with the outside world
18:08:40 <strcat[m]> billzster: doesn't have to be audible to humans
18:08:44 <somenerd[m]> Audio permission?
18:09:07 <somenerd[m]> (I mean is that even possible?)
18:09:30 <strcat[m]> billzster: Network permission disables any direct network access (even to localhost) and also indirect access via any APIs with the INTERNET permission as a requirement
18:09:44 <strcat[m]> billzster: the app can still communicate via mutual consent with other apps within the same profile
18:09:52 <strcat[m]> just can't call their APIs that require INTERNET permission
18:10:19 <strcat[m]> billzster: anyway you're talking about setting the app as your launcher, that places a fair bit of trust in it
18:10:36 <strcat[m]> billzster: really should not be using an app you don't trust as your launcher or *especially* your keyboard
18:11:21 <somenerd[m]> Yeah
18:11:58 <somenerd[m]> >billzster: an app can play audio by default if it's in the foreground, there's a way to communicate with the outside world
18:11:58 <somenerd[m]> Also, could bluetooth be a problem?
18:12:02 <billzster> Thats correct about launcher and I trust the Nova - that was just an example that showed the firebase tracker. In the end the only apps I need to trust is the email client and launcher
18:12:08 <strcat[m]> in fact that's 2 good things to add to Auditor: check if a non-system keyboard or launcher is being used
18:12:23 <strcat[m]> somenerd: bluetooth requires the user to pair devices, requires user interaction
18:12:25 <somenerd[m]> (A way to exfiltrate data)
18:12:33 <strcat[m]> somenerd: unless you have the location permission
18:12:38 <somenerd[m]> The app can’t use it?
18:12:46 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
18:12:49 <strcat[m]> the app has to ask to pair
18:12:56 <somenerd[m]> I see
18:13:11 <strcat[m]> an app can't just communicate via Bluetooth without the user letting it
18:13:35 <strcat[m]> it's not a user-facing permission because there's a case-by-case consent system
18:14:09 <strcat[m]> people misunderstand the purpose / function of the 'normal' permissions
18:20:35 <pokpo> how to do the first verification as I have not another Graphene OS phone
18:20:54 <billzster> Two questions - Probably not possible but 1. Is there a way to monitor traffic (App to Location) available. Is there a way to redirect traffic to say localhost what say app foes to firebase redirect to localhost
18:33:45 <strcat[m]> pokpo: it doesn't have to be a GrapheneOS phone
18:33:50 <strcat[m]> the Auditor can be any Android 7+ phone
18:34:14 <strcat[m]> there's also the remote attestation service https://attestation.app/
18:34:30 <aoude[m]> billzster maybe not the answer you're looking for but VPNs can be used for redirection and to monitor traffic (traffic control on fdroid)
18:34:30 <strcat[m]> billzster: you can use NetGuard but again you're mostly going to be misleading yourself
18:34:34 <strcat[m]> and feeling like you're doing something useful
18:41:53 <pokpo> Thanks
18:48:56 <billzster> I use openvpn with a vpn provider. I am aware of NetGuard but its not the same as a true VPN in my opinion. Will look at traffic control. To bad we cant just use a host file - wondering if a terminal using netstat would work
18:58:18 <billzster> Did you mean TrackerControl aoude[m] - If so - This is another VPN app - Not exactlly what I was looking for but TY
18:59:43 <strcat[m]> billzster: it's not meant to be a VPN, it uses the VPN service to route traffic through itself, which is what the feature provides
18:59:46 <strcat[m]> you can forward from it to an actual proxy
18:59:52 <strcat[m]> anyway what you're doing seems really misguided
19:00:00 <strcat[m]>  * anyway what you're trying to do seems really misguided
19:00:30 <strcat[m]> if you let the app use the internet, you're letting it talk to those services you don't want it to even if you block directly communicating with them
19:00:46 <strcat[m]> what you're trying to do fundamentally won't work because they can send the information to those from their own server
19:01:40 <aoude[m]> <billzster "Did you mean TrackerControl aoud"> Yeah TrackerControl 😅
19:01:41 <strcat[m]> it's meaningful to block internet access as a whole
19:01:55 <strcat[m]> trying to do it in a granular way doesn't work the way you seem to think
19:02:23 <strcat[m]> and you definitely don't want a 'hosts file'
19:02:47 <strcat[m]> maybe what you want to do is filter DNS in which case, the best way to do that is DNS
19:03:04 <strcat[m]> not a legacy way of doing a subset of what it provides
19:03:21 <billzster> Thanks strcat[m]  for the reply - I understand what your saying "Either Trust or Don't" no other way around it. Got It! I was over reaching
19:03:34 <strcat[m]> if an app really wanted it could just exfiltrate data via DNS itself, no need to talk to any specific host
19:03:41 <strcat[m]> here's an example
19:03:54 <strcat[m]> consider an app that queries some_data.example.com
19:03:56 <billzster> Keep going strcat[m]  love the info
19:04:10 <strcat[m]> this ends up ultimately querying the example.com authoritative DNS server
19:04:20 <strcat[m]> an app can exfiltrate data to their own servers simply via your DNS provider
19:04:30 <strcat[m]> they don't need any direct communication with their servers to exfiltrate data
19:04:34 <strcat[m]> what you're trying to do doesn't work
19:04:56 <strcat[m]> if you permit the app to access the internet, even just making DNS queries via your ISP DNS or your DNS provider of choice, it can exfiltrate data via the internet quite directly
19:05:33 <strcat[m]> when it sends a query exfiltrated_data_random.example.com to say your ISP DNS, that gets forwarded along to the authoritative DNS servers for example.com, a server that example.com chose
19:05:53 <strcat[m]> using DNS to exfiltrate data is a common approach in malware
19:06:16 <strcat[m]> that way they never make a connection to their own servers directly
19:06:26 <strcat[m]> it's a common way of doing things in a really sneaky way
19:06:44 <strcat[m]> sure, most malware is written by idiots, but stuff like this isn't hard
19:06:57 <strcat[m]> anyway, from there, they can send off data to anywhere they want
19:07:00 <strcat[m]> any third parties, whatever
19:07:15 <strcat[m]> if you permit them to access the internet at all, you permit them to exfiltrate data anywhere
19:07:21 <strcat[m]> that's just the reality
19:07:37 <strcat[m]> I suggest not giving the app data you don't want it having
19:07:56 <strcat[m]> that is what the app sandbox and permission model is based around: not giving apps sensitive data without consent
19:09:10 <billzster> Got it - I surrender - Now if like a child I installed many apps, uninstalled when realized I was not content with it but now have concluded what is bare essential for my new GraphenOS - do you recommend to unlock boot loader and reinstall GrapnenOS to have a clean install because maybe the uninstalled apps might have left some crumbs that should
19:09:11 <billzster> be rectified?
19:09:58 <strcat[m]> there's no reason to do that
19:09:59 <strcat[m]> if you really wanted you could factory reset, which is equivalent to unlocking and flashing it again, but you really don't need to do that
19:10:39 <strcat[m]> I suggest reading documentation like https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption and the other info on those pages even though it may not directly answer your specific questions because it indirectly answers a lot of it
19:10:45 <strcat[m]> as part of covering other things
19:11:46 <billzster> You Rock! All of you...TY so much for your time and educational points...
19:14:02 <r0tt0r[m]>  when systemupdate is happening does inactive partition flashed with the update and made active?
19:14:51 <take_a_deep_brea> i think thats how AB partitioning works
19:16:19 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: it writes out the update to the inactive set of partitions, if it's an incremental update, it does that by reading the active ones and calculating what it needs to write out based on the deltas
19:16:33 <strcat[m]> once it finishes writing out all the images, it verifies all of them
19:16:59 <strcat[m]> then it does post-installation work - it goes through all the apps and makes sure they are all compiled for the new release, so it'll recompile your installed apps
19:17:11 <strcat[m]> then, when it's done all that, it will mark the new update as ready
19:17:49 <strcat[m]> so, next time the OS boots, it will boot the new version instead - and if it successfully makes it to late stage boot, it will mark the new update as the active OS and the old set will be inactive (and after that point, it can't roll back anymore)
19:17:55 <strcat[m]> if it fails to boot multiple times, it rolls back
19:18:06 <strcat[m]> (until it has succeeded, then it's disabled + locked in with rollback prevention)
19:21:07 <RamenLover> Hey I asked a  question in offtopic channel, if someone who knows about aurora can take a look, would be much appreciated
19:40:19 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "(until it has succeeded, then it"> thx 👍🏻

20:59:31 <jmacnd> what's a good messenger app for grapheneOS? the native one sucks!
21:00:30 <cx7dd[m]> Try QKSMS
21:10:59 <jmacnd> I will give that a whirl!
21:28:13 <Maxattax> okay so I understand this is frowned upon in the community, but I want to understand *why* better: rooted graphene, and graphene with microg... can anyone point me to resources?
21:28:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Maxattax, I'm on my way off the computer, but I can give you a bit about why in a nutshell
21:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to rooting:
21:29:54 <TheJollyRoger> A bit of background with Android; on Android, there are only a few very specific processes with root equivalent access. The first one's init, the second one's kernel, and the third one is vold.
21:30:46 <TheJollyRoger> Everything else is, for safety, written as separate companents, entirely walled off from system with mandatory access controls and constrained to only have access to what they need to do, and *only* what they need to do.
21:31:43 <TheJollyRoger> If you make root application accessible, then that essentially destroys this security model, and not only that, it also precludes the use of verified boot, which means no more device integrity or attestation, and no over the air updating.
21:32:57 <TheJollyRoger> The idea of "the computer should do what the user tells it to do" conceptually sounds great, until we realize that you're running other people's programs on your computer, and they are just as much users as you are.
21:34:23 <Maxattax> Fair enough, thanks for explaining that. The main things I wanted root for were: ad blocking, and automatic updates. Fdroid doesn't allow auto updates without root... are there workarounds for this?
21:35:26 <Maxattax> sad that rooting is done universally, would be cool if it worked like sudo where the app asks the user if it's okay to use a permission
21:35:32 <TheJollyRoger> The other thing is that MicroG we consider to be an antifeature; our philosophy is that Google's services are invasive, requires deep integration with the operating system, and simply implementing these invasive services in a way that's been discovered via reverse-engineering is not good for the security of your device.
21:36:38 <hilly> Hello everyone i hope someone can help me with flashing grapheneos on my pixel 4a. I have been looking on the internet all day but i cant solve the problem I have. I have a W10 computer and never had any programs like platform tools in my computer before i just downloaded it this morning.
21:36:38 <hilly> I have recieve the following error when i try to flash-all.bat

21:37:25 <TheJollyRoger> Maxattax: in theory, we could bundle the F-Droid privileged extension, but F-Droid also contains a large amount of legacy code, and we also consider F-Droid to be insecure due to their security practices and their contravention of the decentralized Android app signing/certificate model.
21:37:29 <Carylmarx> do what it says, get the latest platform tools and unzip into your path

21:38:17 <hilly> it should be the most recent version
21:38:20 <Carylmarx> you need to add to your path
21:38:24 <nscnt[m]> That's not what you should do
21:38:37 <TheJollyRoger> Maxattax: App accessible root is all-or-nothing, it doesn't quite work the way you think it would work in that arrangement.
21:38:54 <nscnt[m]> hilly: Don't follow unofficial tutorials/guides
21:38:57 <TheJollyRoger> Maxattax: remember, with verified boot, even if you did root the phone, any changes you make to the system partition get undone the next reboot.
21:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> hilly: you've followed an unofficial guide. You'll need to follow the one on https://grapheneos.org/install
21:39:31 <TheJollyRoger> The computer is telling you that fastboot is not in your command path.
21:39:50 <TheJollyRoger> Either that or you've missed a step.
21:40:17 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to backtrack to find out where to set the proper command path, and from the proper directory.

21:41:23 <Carylmarx> it does.  what about the FAILED statuses?
21:42:22 <TheJollyRoger> Someone more knowledgeable than I will need to chime in on that, unfortunately.
21:42:27 <TheJollyRoger> I also have to run.
21:42:41 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
21:42:46 <Carylmarx> no worries
21:42:51 <Maxattax> TheJollyRoger: thanks for MicroG explanation and Fdroid privileged... in my own usage, I see it as a greater relative risk to not have my apps up to date consistently than it is to forget manually updating
21:49:57 <hilly> I did miss the step about the PATH
21:50:13 <hilly> But i get the same error now i added it
21:50:28 <Carylmarx> I';m looking over instructions and I see that Win10 is required.  I'm using windows 7.  Grrrr
21:50:39 <Carylmarx> perhaps that's the soufce of my issues
21:54:08 <blk> Carylmarx: what phone?
21:56:36 <Carylmarx> pixel 3
21:57:10 <blk> You're trying to flash the factory images for a Pixel 4a
21:57:24 <Carylmarx> oh
21:58:10 <blk> Please read the install guide very carefully.
21:58:56 <eric80> I have recently installed GrapheneOS and am trying to install apps.  I want to maintain privacy but there is an app- Lockdown Logic that I need to download and it says its GSF dependent?  Will it work and will it compromise security?

22:13:15 <kirby> Hi everybody
22:13:33 <kirby> im installing graphene on my pixel 3a XL

22:14:31 <kirby> getting an issue where it says Android System Theres an internal problem with your device contat your manufacturer for details
22:14:31 <qubits> mrxx i was thinking that could be the case

22:14:55 <Carylmarx> windows 7
22:15:34 <Carylmarx> bumping /tmp to 4gb
22:16:03 <Carylmarx> no error that time.  Thanks!
22:18:22 <mrxx_0[m]> kirby: after flashing GrapheneOS ?
22:19:33 <kirby> mrxx_0[m] yes i think the flash wasnt successful
22:19:51 <kirby> but I just ran the batch script again and I think it worked
22:20:14 <kirby> it was weird it was asking me to setup vanilla android again
22:23:04 <qubits> On Windows, launch a regular non-administrator instance of the PowerShell terminal. Do not use the legacy Command Prompt or administrator variant of PowerShell.
22:23:30 <qubits> Can someone explain how to launch non administrator instnance of the powershell
22:23:55 <qubits> Mhy friend is trying to install on windows 10 , i m using macbook
22:30:50 <qubits> okay it was indeed wrong path
22:53:40 <chris15> hello
22:55:01 <mynacol[m]> chris15: hi
22:55:28 <chris15> can someone help me with installing graphene os?
22:56:21 <mulbr[m]> <eric80 "I have recently installed Graphe"> You need microg probably. Not sure how to do that with graphene but you could try calyxos
22:57:12 <chris15> thank you
23:19:23 <Maxattax> mulbr[m]: is microg not possible on Graphene?
23:28:28 <dazinism> Maxattax: no
23:30:07 <dazinism> Think there are plans to implement support in a secure way(its normally not), but not sure when it would be done.
23:46:09 <Sam[m]7> Hi, long time fan of GrapheneOS, however I’m curious, I can’t seem to get GrapheneOS to connect a call in element/riot.im; since everyone here uses matrix, has anyone else found a way around this issue? Should I be using a different matrix client? It doesn’t seem to matter what server I’m on or what permissions I have enabled on my device, all calls will answer, microphone/camera permissions are enabled, yet I get
23:46:09 <Sam[m]7> audio/video
23:49:36 <Sam[m]7> Pixel 4a "sunfish" if that matters
23:52:58 <frontman[m]1> chris15: what do you need
