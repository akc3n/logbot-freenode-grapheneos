00:15:15 <thematrix5000[m]> I'm on the 3 I got it used for 100 dollars it works perfect with no scratches
00:40:40 <TheJollyRoger> Nicely done!
00:45:32 <TheJollyRoger> I've found that interestingly enough you can sometimes remove scuffs and scratches from the 3 using an ordinary Mr Clean Magic eraser. Those things work wonders.
00:45:56 <rny> is there like a epoxy syringe that will fix screen cracks?
00:46:04 <rny> like how you can repair windscreen chips?
00:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Uh...
00:46:20 * TheJollyRoger sweats.
00:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> I've never heard of one!
00:46:40 <rny> sad
00:46:57 <TheJollyRoger> I mean occasionally yeah you can sometimes use cyanoacrylate to hide cracks in polycarbonate, but that's VERY temporary.
00:50:16 <TheJollyRoger> And it's REALLY messy if you get it wrong.
01:01:07 <rny> i think im due to change phones soon
01:01:28 <rny> when is the 3xl expected to be EOL?
01:02:27 <strcat> rny: under a year
01:02:37 <strcat> 10+ months
01:03:09 <rny> time to set up bargain alerts
01:14:03 <strcat> so nice having working adb persistent keys for development again
01:14:05 <strcat> that was an annoying bug
01:15:39 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/e3e1cd5351b445a0d8df1617bbd2fc456c16cbd0%5E%21/
01:15:40 <strcat[m]> fixed upstream now
01:15:45 <strcat[m]> got more of those issues to resolve
01:15:47 <strcat[m]> :(
01:15:54 <TheJollyRoger> :(
01:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> Aargh!
01:27:40 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 / Pixel 2 XL extended support release in Beta now
01:27:42 <strcat[m]> please test it
01:28:18 <strcat[m]> pretty much the end of useful support for them even if we do some more of these releases
01:34:55 <ghost_matrix[m]> OK so an update got pushed to my phone and I clicked reboot and it gets stuck at the graphene logo.
01:34:55 <ghost_matrix[m]> I can only get into the system if I hard reset.
01:35:07 <ghost_matrix[m]> I hope its not borked
01:35:31 <ghost_matrix[m]> I have to reset it twice to get in by holding down the power button to turn it off
01:35:35 <LinusSexTips[m]> When I updated it took ~5 minutes before booting
01:35:38 <LinusSexTips[m]> And now it's fine
01:35:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> How long did you try waiting?
01:36:07 <ghost_matrix[m]> I guess I didn't wait that long. Have I ruined it now?
01:36:08 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 takes a really long time to boot the update
01:36:10 <strcat[m]> no
01:36:12 <strcat[m]> it's fine
01:36:20 <ghost_matrix[m]> I'm on pixel 4a
01:36:32 <strcat[m]> you might have rolled back the update
01:36:36 <strcat[m]> by forcing it to not boot
01:36:40 <strcat[m]> check what version you're on
01:36:49 <strcat[m]> if it fails to boot N times it rolls back
01:37:17 <ghost_matrix[m]>  RQ1A.201205.008.2020.12.12.03
01:37:26 <ghost_matrix[m]> Is that my version?
01:37:38 <strcat[m]> so you rolled it back
01:37:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah you rolled back
01:37:42 <strcat[m]> you need to update again
01:37:45 <strcat[m]> it will do it automatically
01:37:48 <strcat[m]> or you can trigger it manually now
01:37:55 <strcat[m]> give it more time
01:38:10 <ghost_matrix[m]> Oh I see so I will go back to main profile and there is a pop up that comes up that says reboot
01:39:48 <strcat[m]> the updater runs as part of the owner profile
01:39:55 <strcat[m]> it runs in the background even if you're using another
01:39:59 <strcat[m]> but you won't see the notification
01:40:10 <strcat[m]> you don't actually need to reboot via the notification, any reboot works
01:45:05 <ghost_matrix[m]> <strcat[m] "you don't actually need to reboo"> Ok pefect I will reboot and wait
01:51:43 <ghost_matrix[m]> OK it rebooted....patience was key.
01:51:43 <ghost_matrix[m]> Got worried there for a split second  lol.
01:52:28 <ghost_matrix[m]> Also is there a way to share the same vpn account or connection on different user profiles ?
01:52:35 <ghost_matrix[m]> Or the same apps?
01:52:48 <ghost_matrix[m]> I guess that defeats the whole purpose right?
02:02:27 <rny> ghost_matrix[m]: no
02:02:49 <rny> different user profiles arent meant to share anything with each other
03:00:36 <ghost_matrix[m]> <rny "ghost_matrix: no"> OK perfect
03:01:35 <ghost_matrix[m]> Also put of curiosity if anyone has a pixel 4a.
03:01:35 <ghost_matrix[m]> Are both bottom speakers supposed to play or just the far right one?
03:01:51 <ghost_matrix[m]> Not sure
03:07:38 <rny> both should!
03:07:50 <ghost_matrix[m]> Hmmm
03:08:14 <ghost_matrix[m]> I feel the air come out of one but not the other
03:08:17 <ghost_matrix[m]> The phone is new
03:13:33 <squarmkt[m]> Just right one
03:13:56 <squarmkt[m]> * Just right one for me
03:14:14 <rny> file bug issue on github
03:17:57 * ghost_matrix[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20210107_141723.jpg (145KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pKDDNoizvqQisDjFDIutrOeT/IMG_20210107_141723.jpg >
03:17:58 <ghost_matrix[m]> Nevermind
03:18:09 <ghost_matrix[m]> One is microphone lol
03:19:07 <ghost_matrix[m]> I was thinking both holes at the bottom where speakers
03:19:12 <louipc> lol
03:19:26 <ghost_matrix[m]> There is a top and bottom I believe
03:19:30 <ghost_matrix[m]> Ahaha silly me
04:05:07 <strcat[m]> any issues with the Pixel 2 beta?
04:05:09 <strcat[m]> want to get that wrapped up
04:35:38 <dakotah[m]> > <@ghost_matrix:matrix.org>
04:35:39 <dakotah[m]> > I was thinking both holes at the bottom where speakers
04:35:39 <dakotah[m]> I was wondering why my p4xl only had one working speaker
04:36:40 <strcat[m]> 4a isn't the same as a 4 XL
04:55:01 <theOne[m]> Is it fine to keep my keepassdx password database in my device external storage?
05:01:15 <louipc> would be better in app storage, but it's encrypted anyway
05:16:05 <banjo[m]> theOne: that would be useful as a lowtech way to keep your db synced across multiple profiles
05:16:48 <banjo[m]> * theOne: that would be useful as a lowtech way to keep your db synced across multiple profiles / devices
05:17:25 <theOne[m]> Ok
05:17:28 <theOne[m]> Thanks
05:36:34 <theOne[m]> Is there any recommended file manager to use with grapheneos?
05:43:29 <somenerd[m]> There should be a default one
05:48:20 <faxing[m]> File Manager? The one that comes with the device.  You can revoke all permissions except for storage I believe
05:48:29 <faxing[m]>  * File Manager? The one that comes with the device.  You can revoke all permissions except for storage I believe.
05:58:45 <theOne[m]> Ok
06:25:41 <hai[m]> Hi ! Is there a way to activate dual Sim mode and esim support ? Thx
06:30:38 <take_a_deep_brea> grapheneOS has inbuilt support for esim but wont support the third party apps by carriers that are required for esim . but i beleive an app that would work with grapheneos is in agenda but not that high a priority .so wait and watch i guess.
06:30:49 <take_a_deep_brea> i also suggest waiting for some better answers
06:40:17 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hai[m] "Hi ! Is there a way to activate "> You can activate it from stock OS, flash GrapheneOS and it'll still be there
06:41:02 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159#issuecomment-652123996
06:43:10 <FuchsiaOS_when> But for removing, configuring the eSIMs, it has hard dependency on Play services and propertiary Google priv-apps
06:46:29 <hai[m]> Thank you ! I didn't know that esim support was linked to play services

09:07:18 <nscnt> If your device wasn't recognized (i.e. "<waiting for device>"), it might have been the missing optional driver on Windows
09:07:24 <take_a_deep_brea> staycurious: imo , the installation guide is complete and does not need any modification
09:08:00 <staycurious[m]> <nscnt "If your device wasn't recognized"> All optional drivers was installed as well.

09:10:26 <staycurious[m]> I used the cable that came with the phone as well.
09:10:28 <nscnt> Probably the port, as he used the original one which is only USB C to C
09:10:37 <take_a_deep_brea> staycurious: i said what i said because someone might try what you did before following the official guid
09:11:16 <take_a_deep_brea> and that in fact might not work for them
09:13:05 <nscnt> adb isn't needed at all
09:13:12 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
09:13:53 <nscnt> These error tags are caused by not using PowerShell
09:14:44 <nscnt> *The error tag "outdatet version of fastboot"
09:14:50 <take_a_deep_brea> staycurious: dont get us wrong ,we do appreciate you wanting to share tips with us , just that the installation guide is a bit sensitive
09:17:05 <nscnt> And will result in users typing in stuff they have no idea about which makes supporting them harder because we have no idea what they did (and they don't know as well lol)

10:13:17 <leek274[m]> I have been using grapheneos for months now, that I haven't been heard of here since then is a glowing mark of quality. :)
10:13:17 <leek274[m]> I just discovered one small peculiarity recently: the stock wallpaper of GrapheneOS, those purple mountains - I kept it like that but for some reason the background recently turned black and the original stock wallpaper can't be set anymore. What happened?
10:13:54 <leek274[m]> Or is this actually OT?
10:14:10 <nscnt> leek274[m]: Default wallpaper was set to black

10:18:17 <take_a_deep_brea> <leek274[m] "Why was it set to black? I still"> replace default AOSP wallpaper with a solid black wallpaper - may get a bit fancier in the near future
10:18:21 <leek274[m]> ayaen_t: Yeah, I gotta donate a little! This is insane! A more secure an d rights-respecting OS for the masses, even a noob like myself!
10:18:26 <take_a_deep_brea> that is all i know
10:19:27 <Urija[m]> Im glad about the black wallpaper, was annoyed from setting it to black for every new user anyway.
10:19:39 <leek274[m]> Thanks for the information, I didn't keep up with changelogs and just updated. Glad to hear it's nothing problematic
10:19:52 <take_a_deep_brea> <leek274[m] "ayaen_t: Yeah, I gotta donate a "> unfortunately some people on youtube would have people beleive otherwise
10:20:22 <take_a_deep_brea> Urija: i too love the full black.
10:20:27 <leek274[m]> urija: yeah, probably thats the best way to handle it generally, I wasnt very opinionated about the bg
10:21:13 <take_a_deep_brea> leek274: afaict there may be a dark themed custom bg , mind you its a wild guess
10:22:04 <leek274[m]> Yeah, I'm just glad its all as intended. The thumbnail in the settings tool doesnt really matter. Thanks for clearing it up!
10:22:27 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem
10:23:19 <Urija[m]> I was also impressed to see the 5-Jan security update on my phone in the morning of 6th already - as european, who is a few hours early compared to the US.

11:37:00 <fuchser[m]> Hi guys, do you have a good app for syncing photos and stuff to an shared drive like sftp or WebDAV?
11:38:06 <fuchser[m]> I know that next cloud works pretty good, but I  wouldn't like to run an instance on my home server.
11:40:12 <fuchser[m]> Already thought about a rsync script run with termux. But don't know if this works as expected
12:22:51 <mynacol> Hi, had somebody here already have problems with synchronization/download of some Nextcloud files if they include some special characters? Some of my files won't sync/download if they contain a `?` (100% sure) or `:` or some unicode stuff (the three dot … symbol for example).
12:22:51 <mynacol> I did a logcat and pasted the interesting lines here: http://ix.io/2L9Q No other lines seem to be related.
12:22:51 <mynacol> I also downloaded the same file (this one contains a `?` in the filename) on another device running LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1) with the same app. No Problem there.
12:27:23 <mynacol> There are some related issues on the Nextcloud app, but with the test on the other device I see this works. In both cases the download goes to the internal storage (no filesystem limits by e.g. FAT32) and the exception is thrown in the java.io.File stuff.
13:39:37 <COVID-1984> damn just lost like 100 tabs I had - any idea how to restore?
13:39:41 <COVID-1984> phone powered off from lack of power
13:39:56 <COVID-1984> vanadium... "recently closed" only shows like 5
13:40:13 <COVID-1984> damn knew I should have figured out a way to back them up sooner
13:45:28 <COVID-1984> I realize it probably isn't GOS's fault, but this pathetic problem was common over 10 years ago too... They can't figure out how to lock a sessions file correctly?
13:45:58 <strcat[m]> pretty sure it's in an sqlite db
13:45:58 <somenerd[m]> > damn just lost like 100 tabs I had - any idea how to restore?
13:45:58 <somenerd[m]> maybe check history?
13:47:00 <COVID-1984> somenerd[m]: not sure how many would be in history - all 100+ can load into history every time vanadium is opened?
13:47:17 <strcat[m]> mynacol: app internal storage can have those characters, shared storage is more limited on purpose for compatibility
13:47:35 <strcat[m]> mynacol: set it up to use app internal storage if you can
13:47:42 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: not sure how many would be in history - all 100+ can load into history every time vanadium is opened?
13:47:43 <somenerd[m]> not too sure maybe check it just to make sure?
13:47:43 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: thought the chromium session data is in profiles dir in some kind of lastSessions file
13:48:02 <COVID-1984> somenerd[m]: well I would have no idea how to tell since it is mixed with search history
13:48:16 <COVID-1984> maybe I can connect to computer and find the old sessions file?
13:49:37 <mynacol> strcat[m]‎: So there is a restriction by GrapheneOS?
13:49:46 <strcat[m]> mynacol: no
13:49:47 <strcat[m]> mynacol: there isn't
13:49:52 <strcat[m]> there is a restriction by Android
13:50:03 <strcat[m]> you probably haver a different configuration for the app on both devices
13:50:27 <mynacol> strcat[m]‎: Moving to app internal storage defeats the purpose, as I want to sync my music library with nextcloud and play it with vlc
13:50:37 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: any idea if vanadium's profiles folder is available when adb mounts GOS on the computer?
13:51:18 <strcat[m]> mynacol: nothing in that statement implies not using app internal storage
13:51:26 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: definitely not
13:51:44 <COVID-1984> possible to see the files in GOS from the UX?
13:52:01 <COVID-1984> maybe they're still there and chromium ignores them
13:53:08 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: they're in the app's data directory
13:53:27 <COVID-1984> how can I browse to it on GOS?
13:53:34 <strcat[m]> and Chromium excludes most files from backups because they have a portable data format via sync
13:53:39 <strcat[m]> you can't because Chromium excludes them from backups
13:54:05 <COVID-1984> I can't browse to vanadium's data dir?
13:54:12 <COVID-1984> inside of GOS
13:54:20 <strcat[m]> we haven't made our own sync / backup implementation or expanded the whitelist for the OS backup
13:54:35 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: app data directories aren't directly accessible, you can obtain the data in them via OS backups
13:54:48 <strcat[m]> apps can't access each other's data
13:55:10 <strcat[m]> the files you can access via the UI are the ones in your home directory - not app data
13:55:37 <strcat[m]> unless apps specifically use their external data directory (the ones in Android/ in your home directory) for the data
13:55:40 <strcat[m]> rather than their internal data
13:55:46 <COVID-1984> so the only way I can access is a backup, but the only way to look at a backup is on GOS?
13:56:04 <strcat[m]> no
13:56:14 <mynacol> strcat[m]‎: So has Android 8-11 introduced this limitation? Under Android 7.1.2/LineageOS 14.1 these files can be downloaded. Both Nextcloud apps sync/download under /storage/emulated/0/Android/media/com.nextcloud.client/. On Android 7 this works, on GOS not. Thanks for your responses!
13:56:14 <COVID-1984> or I can decrypt/extract a GOS backup on my computer?
13:56:20 <strcat[m]> what I'm saying is that you can use adb backup and then extract the backup data
13:56:29 <strcat[m]> you could technically do it with Seedvault but there aren't tools for it
13:56:41 <mynacol> Now migrating to app internal storage to test...
13:56:43 <strcat[m]> mynacol: no, it hasn't
13:57:45 <COVID-1984> ok will try adb backup right now
13:58:03 <COVID-1984> it would have access to vanadium's profiles dir, yes?
13:58:30 <strcat[m]> mynacol: think you're not understanding what I mean
13:58:42 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: I don't think so because Chromium has a list of files to exclude
13:58:45 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: you can try
13:58:58 <strcat[m]> but I don't expect it to contain much since as I said
13:59:05 <strcat[m]> they disable it to avoid a conflict with their own sync
13:59:11 <strcat[m]> and because their own sync leaves out non-portable portions
13:59:33 <COVID-1984> damn
13:59:36 <COVID-1984> i guess I'll try anyway
14:02:39 <COVID-1984> in my view losing data because you didn't plug your phone in is ludicrous
14:03:00 <COVID-1984> even worse when google supposedly built these as 'cloud devices' - I suppose the same would happen on vanilla android
14:05:20 <COVID-1984> i did adb kill-server, adb start-server, adb devices: none recognized :(
14:07:57 <COVID-1984> enabled debugging on GOS and now it sees it
14:08:49 <COVID-1984> adb: unable to connect for backup: insufficient permissions for device
14:09:06 <COVID-1984> In USB menu I selected "file transfer" - is that incorrect?
14:09:40 <COVID-1984> If I select USB control: connected device, then it doesn't work - so I kept it at "this device"
14:10:14 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://github.com/tlambertz/seedvault_backup_parser
14:10:14 <FuchsiaOS_when> Might help
14:10:15 <FuchsiaOS_when> Did not test this myself however
14:10:55 <COVID-1984> not using seedvault cuz of what strcat[m] said above. just adb backup (which complains it is deprecated)... damn android is a steaming pile
14:11:36 <FuchsiaOS_when> Okay, I see, apologies
14:11:51 <COVID-1984> any idea why adb devices says 'no permissions'?
14:12:25 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: it's deprecated because everything is supposed to move to backup services like Seedvault
14:12:32 <strcat[m]> same low-level backup implementation
14:12:41 <strcat[m]> but adb backup still works
14:13:10 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: sounds like you're using adb on a broken Linux distribution
14:13:31 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: you could follow the instructions in the install guide for fastboot and just use adb instead of fastboot
14:13:54 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: I doubt it's going to include the data you want because I've looked at their manifest and code
14:14:03 <COVID-1984> i got adb working before on this
14:14:09 <COVID-1984> but i just forgot how on GOS
14:14:14 <strcat[m]> and what they do is disable the standard OS backups and implement their own backup service - but they only include data not covered by sync
14:14:34 <strcat[m]> so since Vanadium doesn't have sync
14:14:39 <strcat[m]> we eventually need to deal with changing that
14:15:52 <COVID-1984> ya i think we need access to our own data
14:16:03 <COVID-1984> at least bookmarks, tabs, etc (not passwords)... on the filesystem
14:16:10 <COVID-1984> then can just sync with generic stuff
14:16:27 <COVID-1984> isn't there something in GOS that can cause this "no permissions" issue in adb?
14:16:39 <COVID-1984> I enabled USB debugging in GOS to get it to show in adb's devices
14:17:01 <COVID-1984> and which selection is correct in the USB menu? "file transfer" strcat[m] ?
14:17:43 <strcat[m]> it's obviously not going to store the data in external storage
14:17:56 <strcat[m]> I think you're misunderstanding how the system works and the app sandbox
14:18:01 <strcat[m]> if you think that it's normal to put the data there
14:18:18 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: no, it is not a GrapheneOS issue, your Linux distribution is broken
14:18:40 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: adb access has nothing to do with that USB mode, it's a separate protocol from that
14:19:04 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: nothing to do with GrapheneOS
14:19:10 <strcat[m]> the permission error is for accessing the usb device in your OS
14:24:03 <COVID-1984> ok needed sudo tnx
14:27:01 <COVID-1984> backup.ab is only 4.5k
14:27:10 <COVID-1984> :(
14:29:27 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: does it matter which USB it is in? like "file transfer"?
14:32:52 <strcat[m]> no
14:33:02 <strcat[m]> adb is separate
14:34:24 <COVID-1984> I did get "Backup finished" on GOS
14:34:32 <COVID-1984> any idea why it is like nothing?
14:34:40 <COVID-1984> perhaps adb backup isn't actually supported...
14:37:19 <strcat> it is supported
14:37:24 <strcat> you have to pass the appropriate options
14:37:57 <strcat> but as I said Chromium overrides the standard OS backup implementation which includes all files
14:59:00 <precentor[m]> Hey people, I'm having some trouble flashing the os
14:59:32 <precentor[m]> I have gotten to the part where the bootloader is unlocked and i moved all the files into the adbfastboot folder
14:59:47 <precentor[m]> but when i launch the flash-all.bat file
14:59:53 <precentor[m]> cmd opens for a second then closes
15:01:22 <precentor[m]> im on windows, i just double click the file and that happens. am i doing something wrong?
15:03:41 <FuchsiaOS_when> <precentor[m] "im on windows, i just double cli"> Yeah, that is not supposed to be double-clicked
15:03:46 <FuchsiaOS_when> And not really supposed to move the file there
15:04:18 <FuchsiaOS_when> Gotta start over from scratch and follow the command sequences in grapheneos.org/install as is
15:04:34 <precentor[m]> oops, what am i doing wrong? all the tutorials ive watched do it that way (im a bit of a newb)
15:05:59 <FuchsiaOS_when> <FuchsiaOS_when "Gotta start over from scratch an"> Yeah, as quoted from the site
15:07:01 <precentor[m]> ok, going to start over again then
15:07:20 <FuchsiaOS_when> Good luck ^^
15:13:19 <precentor[m]> now ive reached where i must "fastboot flashing unlock" but its stuck at "waiting for any devices"
15:18:58 <precentor[m]> nvm ive found a way to do it outside of the powershell
15:25:00 <FuchsiaOS_when> <precentor[m] "now ive reached where i must "fa"> Welp. Could have just tried moving the usb to other ports.
15:26:04 <precentor[m]> downloading the .zip from powershell rn, its very slow haha
15:26:28 <precentor[m]> <FuchsiaOS_when "Welp. Could have just tried movi"> but it seems to be working fine, thanks
15:32:03 <FuchsiaOS_when> <precentor[m] "downloading the .zip from powers"> Depends on your internet
15:36:37 <COVID-1984> strcat: pass options to adb? any links to show how? I didn't see them in the fastboot guide
15:39:25 <COVID-1984> rrrr so I suppose the best I can do is screenshot a few dozen packages of vanadium history
15:39:28 <COVID-1984> and come back to it later
15:41:48 <COVID-1984> just gonna let go... you can't restore 100s of tabs from history, just not a solution.
15:43:37 <COVID-1984> Warning: Don't let your device run out of batteries if you expect to keep your vanadium tabs!
15:44:50 <strcat> I doubt it usually happens in that situation
15:44:57 <strcat> you ran into some edge case
15:45:02 <strcat> it has nothing to do with Vanadium specifically
15:45:06 <strcat> you're overdoing it
15:47:11 <COVID-1984> ah ya my fault
15:47:13 <COVID-1984> not
15:50:07 <strcat> never said anything like that
15:50:15 <COVID-1984> I'm overdoing what?
15:50:21 <COVID-1984> My warning is 100% true
15:50:30 <COVID-1984> you might lose all your tabs if your device runs out of power
15:50:41 <strcat> no, it's not, you haven't determined what exactly caused it
15:51:05 <COVID-1984> one doesn't need to to say what I said
15:51:07 <strcat> you're the only person to have ever brought this up as an issue, I doubt it happens any time power is lost
15:51:17 <COVID-1984> I never said any time
15:51:19 <COVID-1984> one time
15:51:21 <COVID-1984> is enough to be weary
15:51:24 <COVID-1984> and backup
15:51:42 <COVID-1984> chromium's tab storage has threads all over the web with similar issues
15:52:56 <COVID-1984> 90+% of what is in vanadium's history is not those tabs, there was no way to backup tabs that I could find for GOS/vanadium... be weary
15:53:00 <COVID-1984> pretty reasonable I think
15:53:53 <nscnt> I don't expect my web browser to keep a backup (or whatever) of my tabs. I save "important" URLs in my notes and I'm fine (which I might never open again anyway lol)
15:56:10 <strcat> COVID-1984: did you look in 'Recent tabs'?
15:56:17 <COVID-1984> Totally
15:56:22 <strcat> nscnt: it has bookmarks
15:57:06 <nscnt> Sure, but I prefer it this way
15:59:16 <COVID-1984> nscnt: cuz browsers suck... they are like a portal for the web into the user instead of a portal into the web for the user.
15:59:44 <FuchsiaOS_when> More of an www problem on that too
15:59:54 <FuchsiaOS_when> A huge web problem
16:02:47 <strcat> matrix irc bridge is so annoying
16:07:21 <COVID-1984> when can we conclude that matrix has failed or doesn't meet the cutoff?
16:31:28 <strcat[m]> they made a partial fix for this but then didn't deploy it
16:31:29 <strcat[m]> due to Matrix server performance issues
16:36:24 <precentor[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: thank you so much for your help! my pixel with graphene is working!
16:50:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> <COVID-1984 "when can we conclude that matrix"> Good alternatives? #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
16:51:07 <COVID-1984> hypokeimenon[m]: loads... considering we're talking public channels, then why not telegram? I self-host Wire
16:51:12 <COVID-1984> hypokeimenon[m]:
16:56:00 <FuchsiaOS_when> <COVID-1984 "hypokeimenon🖤‍❤️🏳️‍🌈: loads.."> Wire is decentralized?
16:59:11 <COVID-1984> FuchsiaOS_when: I don't care/believe in decentralization
16:59:18 <COVID-1984> Like I said, you cna run your own server tho
16:59:41 <COVID-1984> and make your client apps have accounts on it instead of the main one
17:07:16 <FuchsiaOS_when> <COVID-1984 "Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: I don"> Not really what I'm asking
17:17:41 <vikingthortao[m]> hey there having trouble reinstalling a fresh copy of graphene
17:18:00 <vikingthortao[m]> it gets stuck at ./flashall
17:18:05 <vikingthortao[m]> any tips?
17:19:16 <FuchsiaOS_when> <vikingthortao[m] "it gets stuck at ./flashall"> What OS?
17:20:02 <vikingthortao[m]> mac
17:20:05 * FuchsiaOS_when sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VzrCEUXzStDzHHLuyYasNdoF/message.txt >
17:20:19 <FuchsiaOS_when> <vikingthortao[m] "mac"> It's supposed to be ./flash-all.sh
17:20:21 <vikingthortao[m]> yeah the first one
17:20:51 <FuchsiaOS_when> Does it say <waiting for device>?
17:21:25 <vikingthortao[m]> well i just rebooted graphene so i need to check again
17:21:34 <vikingthortao[m]> it just said sending xxx.. and nothing
17:21:48 <vikingthortao[m]> in the tutorials it looked like more was supposed to happen
17:23:23 <vikingthortao[m]> doing adb reboot bootlaoder now
17:23:33 <FuchsiaOS_when> try and check again if you did follow as is in grapheneos.org/install
17:23:36 <vikingthortao[m]> now in fastboot mode status=unlocked
17:23:45 <FuchsiaOS_when> Hmmm
17:24:13 <FuchsiaOS_when> Try plugging the usb cable in other port and do ./flash-all.sh?
17:26:26 <vikingthortao[m]> Sending 'bootloader_a' (8369 KB)
17:26:28 <vikingthortao[m]> thats all it does
17:26:59 <vikingthortao[m]> should i just leave it
17:31:55 <vikingthortao[m]> hmm
17:32:44 <FuchsiaOS_when> Yeah
17:32:45 <FuchsiaOS_when> Gotta wait?
17:33:28 <vikingthortao[m]> still Sending 'bootloader_a' (8369 KB)
17:33:30 <vikingthortao[m]> no error message
17:33:33 <nscnt> Yes, wait
17:34:49 <strcat> vikingthortao[m]: sounds like your USB cable is not reliable
17:34:57 <strcat> or the USB port
17:35:06 <strcat> read what it says about USB in prerequisites
17:35:30 <strcat> I recommend using a better cable / port (and avoid hubs) and reboot to the bootloader menu again (it's one of the actions it can do)
17:35:32 <nscnt> Oh didn't see he has the message for 7 minutes ^^
17:35:43 <strcat> it will have screwed it up now
17:35:52 <strcat> so use the restart bootloader option
17:36:06 <strcat> and make sure to use a high quality cable
17:36:28 <vikingthortao[m]> ok thanks strcat
17:36:47 <nscnt> I even tested it with the Apple keyboard USB passthrough and it worked
17:37:01 <strcat> apple makes USB ports/hubs that follow the specs
17:37:06 <vikingthortao[m]> it was the cable
17:37:06 <nscnt> I think it's really hard to mess up on macOS
17:37:20 <strcat> nscnt: using a third party cable / hub
17:37:26 <strcat> but since their computers have USB-C
17:37:31 <strcat> much less likely someone does that
17:37:58 <vikingthortao[m]> it was a cheap cable off ebay
17:38:21 <vikingthortao[m]> i used a good cable usbc-usbc and it brought me to fastbootd screen
17:38:24 <vikingthortao[m]> thanks
17:38:49 <nscnt> I used a third party USB C to USB A cable, but seems like high quality I guess hehe
17:39:06 <nscnt> You priveleged guys with USB C ports
17:39:22 <nscnt> *privileged
17:42:24 <strcat[m]> vikingthortao: most USB-C cables are not to spec and break it
17:42:33 <strcat[m]> because they aren't actually usable to send a lot of data reliably
17:43:24 <strcat[m]> and the fastboot protocol doesn't know how to handle a broken cable by doing something like sending parity bits and retrying data sending if it fails to send a block
17:43:34 <strcat[m]> it just sends all the data and the other end tells it if it worked
17:43:46 <strcat[m]> which is fine and should work fine
17:43:55 <strcat[m]> if cables follow the spec
17:44:15 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to be a digital connection that either succeeds or doesn't
17:44:28 <strcat[m]> if it fails to send data the protocol itself is supposed to deal with it
17:44:37 <strcat[m]> but yeah broken cables
18:11:53 <randomusertester> Hey privacy conscious friends. I just installed Grapheneos for the first time and I love it so far 🥰
18:13:14 <randomusertester> Does anybody know how you can use signal and block normal calls and text messages. So nobody can contact me outside Signal without a trace
18:14:59 <bentley> take out your sim card?
18:15:05 <Snowstorm> Its in the signal settings
18:15:08 <Snowstorm> Or that
18:16:17 <Snowstorm> So uh I just updated Graphene a couple days ago, and now the default wallpaper is just black
18:16:44 <Snowstorm> I can see it in the preview, but when I select it, its black
18:17:16 <bentley> it's mentioned in the release notes
18:17:21 <bentley> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.05.03
18:20:12 <brenneke[m]> <bentley "take out your sim card?"> Sim card for sure, could also try revoking all permissions for Phone and Messaging apps.
18:23:30 <Snowstorm> Oh "*replace default AOSP wallpaper with a solid black wallpaper - may get a bit fancier in the near future
18:23:40 <strcat[m]> randomusertester: not receiving the messages won't stop people trying to send them
18:23:46 <Snowstorm> ^^^^
18:24:29 <strcat[m]> and once they send them, they can be intercepted, so it won't resolve that
18:26:22 <Snowstorm> Well does anyone know where I can redownload the AOSP  wallpaper? I liked it lol
18:27:21 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/8398e8261e451358b779514569825ae7a94ef579/core/res/res/drawable-sw600dp-nodpi/default_wallpaper.png
18:29:52 <leek274[m]> It's hours later and the discussion if the wallpaper is still ongoing? Oh my haha, sorry.
18:29:52 <leek274[m]> Another GrapheneOS-related question: how does the OS actually encrypt device data? Is it encrypted by default?
18:30:29 <strcat[m]> leek274: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
18:30:36 <Snowstorm> Fuchsia thank you!
18:30:44 <strcat[m]> disk encryption is always enabled
18:30:53 <leek274[m]> Did my message just go out twice? Sorry for that, I'm using Syphon, is that the problem?
18:31:16 <strcat[m]> verified boot is enabled once you lock the bootloader
18:32:30 <Snowstorm> Leek you message didn't double post
18:32:58 <Snowstorm> Also the wallpaper thing wasn't from earlier, I just asked about it
18:35:34 <leek274[m]> Okay
18:38:47 <anonhat[m]> Is wifi calling incompatible for security reasons, or due ot a lack of development resources for it?
18:46:16 <FuchsiaOS_when> Is that related to SIMs/carriers?
18:47:59 <strcat[m]> anonhat: VoLTE / VoWiFi work fine when the carrier sets it up properly
18:48:22 <strcat[m]> we're shipping more carrier-specific configurations for various things in the next release
18:48:57 <anonhat[m]> In the US, are there recommended carriers? I know you recommended T-Mobile yesterday for VoLTE.
18:50:42 <blk> I'm liking Mint Mobile so far. WiFi calling works so far.
18:59:39 <anonhat[m]> Mint is also based on the T-Mobile network, so that makes sense. It's a shame carriers want to have root access to your phone to provide basic features. Not to mention the fact that I pay for a plan with the "privilege" of hotspot functionality, and yet my carrier still insists on blocking it on stock android devices. Graphene doesn't have their bloatware, though, so I can actually use my hardware the way it was
18:59:40 <anonhat[m]> designed to be used if I want to.
19:00:26 <Snowstorm> I have a mint mobile trial sim getting here today :D
19:00:38 <anonhat[m]> Reminds me of when residential ISPs used to charge a "wifi" fee. It would be hilarious if it weren't so god awful.
19:01:40 <anonhat[m]> I think I'll try either Mint, T-Mobile or some other carrier with T-Mobile.
19:01:46 <FuchsiaOS_when> Not exactly root, but very privileged app
19:01:54 <FuchsiaOS_when> Sprint is like one of the worst
19:02:25 <FuchsiaOS_when> Need to have device management app (?) iirc. Basically let us backdoor you or no carrier service
19:03:53 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/364#issuecomment-710709099
19:04:36 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://gist.github.com/thestinger/171b5ffdc54a50ee44497028aa137ed8
19:06:50 <take_a_deep_brea> what the fuck is that?
19:07:12 <take_a_deep_brea> do they even need somany permissions ?
19:10:56 <FuchsiaOS_when> <take_a_deep_brea "do they even need somany permiss"> Yeah, it's quite too privileged just to get 4G
19:14:35 <FuchsiaOS_when> Imagine trusting your network that much
19:14:38 <take_a_deep_brea> weird creepy  people . or worked for so long with cell towers that they dont know what permissions an app needs.either way not very flattering.
19:16:46 <larncat[m]> <anonhat[m] "In the US, are there recommended"> Verizon VoLTE works, no WiFi calling though.
19:47:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> larncat: wifi calling will never work
19:48:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> US carriers need an app we don't plan to ship at all to enable wifi calling
19:48:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Merely including the app doesn't work either
19:48:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to mess around with the selinux policy and google doesn't document how they do it
19:48:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> * US carriers need an app we don't plan to ship at all (needed to enable wifi calling)
19:49:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Carriers in other countries don't really use that app so we can get wifi calling working on those
20:10:03 <anonhat[m]> Except that T-Mobile apparently doesn't use it either. I never thought I would become a T-Mobile subscriber, but it looks like I will now.
20:19:23 <blk> anupritaisno1: WiFi calling does work though...
20:20:16 <blk> T-Mobile WiFi calling, that is
20:25:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> We plan to do a second beta soon btw
20:25:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> We'll be testing Verizon visual voicemail and wifi calling fixes for most carriers
20:26:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please do try the beta to find any breakages
20:26:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Though we did test it for several months now
20:33:15 <blk> anupritaisno1: I don't understand. On one hand you say "wifi calling will never work" and on the other "wifi calling fixes for most carriers". :/
20:33:53 <blk> I think the feature is fairly important to many users, and as a new user myself I am excstatic that it work on Mint.
20:34:41 <blk> obviously if the carrier's implementation is a weak point, there is little to be done. But why advertise that it "will never work"?
20:52:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> <blk "obviously if the carrier's imple"> Because we are not shipping that app
20:52:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Needs a hack to work right now
20:53:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> And if carriers don't want to do this correctly it is their problem
20:54:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <blk "anupritaisno1: I don't understan"> There are many carriers where it can be fixed
21:34:19 <mulbr[m]> jameshandcockandjoe did you get banned
21:43:55 <jameshandcockand> Did I get banned?
21:45:46 <mulbr[m]> Maybe it was just somebody that sounded like you
21:45:52 <mulbr[m]> Not a mod
21:47:40 <blk> anupritaisno1: I guess I misunderstood. Seems you were talking about a specific US carrier that won't work.
21:48:50 <blk> i.e. not *all* US carriers
22:08:50 <larncat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "larncat: wifi calling will never"> Too bad. Thanks for the update. At least VoLTE and SMS-over -WiFi is working
22:09:14 <larncat[m]> On Verizon, that is
22:50:51 <Ivor> Hi! I installed GrapheneOS 2 days ago on a new Pixel 4a but the next day the wallpaper went dark!!!
22:51:31 <Ivor> How can I restore the default wallpaper?
22:53:42 <cheeriope[m]> Ivor: it is intentional as part of the recent update
22:54:08 <Snowstorm> > https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/8398e8261e451358b779514569825ae7a94ef579/core/res/res/drawable-sw600dp-nodpi/default_wallpaper.png
22:54:31 <Snowstorm> You can redownload that and set it, if you want it back
22:56:51 <Ivor> Ah okay! I thought I messed up something on my phone.
22:57:21 <thecomputercheat> Aha, I see the question I joined to ask is being answered
22:58:00 <thecomputercheat> Just put new SIM in and thought I messed something up somehow
23:49:56 <strcat[m]> jameshandcockandjoe: yes, other moderators were unhappy with your trolling, but if you stop that you can be unbanned
