00:00:31 <uhsa> zeothgze[m] I am using the browserchat
00:00:52 <zeothgze[m]> Are you able to read now?
00:01:37 <zeothgze[m]> Those are the 3 options I know
00:01:39 <uhsa> yes thanks if i download the apk file on my pc can i use the MD5 SHA checksum utility i have installed
00:02:39 <zeothgze[m]> Where did you find the MD5 SHA checksum to compare with?
00:03:25 <uhsa> zeothgze[m] im sorry i am mixing signal apk wich has a sha256 and f-droid wich has pgp verification
00:03:43 <uhsa> So it cannot be done on the device itself before installation
00:03:54 <dazinism> Can also check app fingerprint on phone
00:03:59 <zeothgze[m]> <zeothgze[m] "Where did you find the MD5 SHA c"> I mean: If the fdroid website was hacked and provided a malicious apk, I guess the hackers would also be able to put a malicious MD5 on the website!?
00:04:52 <dazinism> uhsa: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
00:04:55 <uhsa> dazinism where could i find the signal apk fingerpring i just downloaded it
00:06:02 <dazinism> Its on their website. Also on the wiki I just linked. Also the wiki details other trusted places you can find it
00:06:14 <dazinism> Also details how to verify
00:06:45 <dazinism> uhsa: you downloaded from the signal website?
00:07:20 <zeothgze[m]> <uhsa "dazinism where could i find the "> If you want to verify Signal (and not F-droid), here is their fingerprint: https://signal.org/android/apk/
00:07:20 <uhsa> dazinism yes i downloaded from the website signal.org i meant where can i find the fingerprint to compare it with on my graphene os
00:08:05 <dazinism> uhsa: look at the wiki I just linked. The verifying apps section
00:08:19 <dazinism> Its a bit of a chicken and egg situation
00:08:30 <dazinism> Have to download an app to verify apps
00:08:49 <dazinism> But there are a few to choose from.
00:09:54 <zeothgze[m]> <dazinism "Have to download an app to verif"> Not if you download on your PC, then verify on your PC, and then pass it to your phone.
00:13:57 <dazinism> zeothgze: true. Depends if you have the necessary app on your desktop
00:14:20 <dazinism> Also desktops are less secure than phones
00:15:44 <uhsa> dazinism if i understand the site correctly i would have to download ClassyShark3xodus to check before installation
00:15:47 <zeothgze[m]> <dazinism "zeothgze: true. Depends if you h"> True! :-)
00:16:38 <dazinism> uhsa: yes,
00:17:27 <dazinism> GrapheneOS will eventually have its own app store
00:17:52 <uhsa> dazinism i already installed f-droid unfortunately so there is no way to check the pgp on the device, the guide you sent has left a blank space at verifying using pgp signatures
00:17:54 <zeothgze[m]> <dazinism "Also desktops are less secure th"> That's a big assertion. I am not sure the Qubes disposable VM I used is so insecure.
00:18:14 <dazinism> Which will make it possible to get over the chicken and egg problem
00:19:00 <uhsa> dazinism Yes that would be amazing for the less technical users
00:19:03 <uhsa> like me
00:19:23 <dazinism> zeothgze: QubesOS is good, I use it, but not as secure as a iOS or a pixel
00:20:14 <uhsa> so did you both check the pgp on a pc?
00:21:00 <zeothgze[m]> <uhsa "so did you both check the pgp on"> I did for both of my stores (Aurora and Fdroid) and for Signal.
00:22:02 <dazinism> uhsa: I did initially check the pgp sig of F-Droid on a PC then move on from there.
00:22:21 <uhsa> zeothgze[m] And then transfer it via usb to where on the phone?
00:23:03 <zeothgze[m]> <zeothgze[m] "I did for both of my stores (Aur"> That said, I guess the probability to get a malicious apk from the fdroid website or Aurora website or signal website is very minimal. Depends on your level of paranoia or your appetite for security.
00:23:10 <dazinism> Anywhere. Then click on it and install
00:24:03 <dazinism> Could also download and check on another phone
00:24:11 <Lestat[m]> can i remove anything after cloning gos source tree
00:24:15 <dazinism> Get an app from the play store to checn
00:24:21 <dazinism> * check
00:24:34 <Lestat[m]> Cuz that just ate 80gb of my ssd
00:25:05 <uhsa> zeothgze[m] I wanted to download aurora store from f-droid but now i will install it from their site i believe is more secure
00:25:12 <louipc> depends on what youre doing
00:25:23 <zeothgze[m]> <uhsa "zeothgze And then transfer it vi"> If you plug your phone on your desktop and connect to your phone, folders (of your phone) will appear. Just drop you apk somewhere in a folder. Then go on your phone to find the folder and click on the apk.
00:25:57 <Lestat[m]> <louipc "depends on what youre doing"> Danny bribed me into tryin to conttibute
00:26:13 <Lestat[m]> * Danny bribed me into tryin to contribute
00:26:57 <uhsa> @dazinism ''could also download and check on another phone'' how would that work exactly?
00:28:55 <dazinism> uhsa: play store is really pretty secure. So are modern android devices
00:29:24 <dazinism> You'd be safer than using a PC and downloading apps from websites
00:29:27 <Lestat[m]> Aurora store is awesome
00:30:42 <uhsa> dazinism yes but i read on the website something about microG not being a good option so i think play store would be the same?
00:31:15 <zeothgze[m]> <Lestat[m] "Aurora store is awesome"> In my experience, it can sometimes be a bit buggy. Problem is, I don't know better to access the Google Play Store anonymously.
00:31:40 <dazinism> uhsa: use this app https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.xgouchet.packageexplorer
00:32:14 <uhsa> when i click the url it says ''We're sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server.''
00:32:43 <uhsa> what is the official site of aurora store?
00:34:06 <dazinism> Yeah just saw that its not available any more
00:34:35 <dazinism> Aurora Store is an alternative way to get apps from the Play Store
00:34:50 <dazinism> You can use it on GrapheneOS
00:36:00 <zeothgze[m]> <uhsa "what is the official site of aur"> https://auroraoss.com/
00:36:05 <uhsa> dazinism yes i wanted to download the aurora store should i download it through f-droid or on their website
00:38:07 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> does anyone here use bromite instead of vanadium?
00:39:19 <entry1[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "does anyone here use bromite ins"> Sure, what's your question?
00:39:41 <dazinism> @freenode_uhsa:matrix.org: think the best app to use would be https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux
00:40:13 <dazinism> Can use apksigner there
00:40:38 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I wanted to know if its as secure. I like it more because of adblock and dark theme. its the same pretty much right?
00:41:26 <zeothgze[m]> <dazinism "@freenode_uhsa:matrix.org: think"> What's the point of using termux to verify an app if you cannot verify termux first?
00:41:54 <dazinism> zeothgze: on another android device, get it from play store
00:42:19 <dazinism> Then use it to verify the apk of an app store
00:42:28 <zeothgze[m]> <zeothgze[m] "What's the point of using termux"> Oh right, I got your point. You trust the Play Store and, consequently, Termux on the Play Store.
00:42:33 <dazinism> Transfer the apk to your GrapheneOS device
00:42:48 <entry1[m]> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "I wanted to know if its as secur"> I like the adblocking within Bromite, but it can sometimes cause sites not to work correctly. I personally keep adblock enabled and if it is too restrictive, use Vanadium. You can create Incognito shortcuts and keep it so it won't ever remember history locally and have it open links in Incognito
00:43:02 <dazinism> zeothgze: yeah the play store is trusted. Downloads are very secure
00:43:39 <zeothgze[m]> <dazinism "zeothgze: yeah the play store is"> Well, isn't Aurora on the Play Store? If so, no need of Termux!
00:43:59 <dazinism> p8tuahpirua5ra: its not as secure.
00:44:13 <entry1[m]> Vanadium recently got rid of showing the user-agent which was great.
00:44:29 <dazinism> Vanadium is modified to take advantage of hardening in GrapheneOS
00:44:50 <zeothgze[m]> dazinism: I think your webpage lack a good GPG/PGP procedure! ;-)
00:46:00 <dazinism> Yeah, one day I'll get around to that....
00:47:01 <entry1[m]> <dazinism "Vanadium is modified to take adv"> I believe it is the WebView that is hardened, which carries across other browsers like Bromite
00:50:05 <dazinism> entry1: no, bromite doesn't use the system webview
00:50:54 <dazinism> Bromite is a complete browser. You can get an idea from the download size
00:51:12 <dazinism> Browsers that use webview are much smaller
00:52:54 <dazinism> zeothgze: no Google don't allow Aurora, FDroid or,  I think, any app store.
00:53:15 <dazinism> On the Play Store
00:53:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> It seems that even though I block Android System WebView's access to Internet, other apps can still use it. Will ASW log on me anyways?
00:56:19 <uhsa> @dazanism if i understand correctly i download termux through the appstore on another android device, then i download on that android device the apk file then use termux to verify the apk file after it is verified transfer to graphene os? How would i use termux to check the file?
00:56:31 <entry1[m]> <dazinism "Bromite is a complete browser. Y"> Interesting. Are there any browsers that would utilize the hardened webview other than Vanadium?
00:56:47 <dazinism> uhsa: yeah
00:57:06 <dazinism> In termux use
00:57:15 <uhsa> and how can i transfer the file between devices securely
00:57:19 <dazinism> pkg install apksigner
01:00:16 <dazinism> Then once you download an app store apk file use
01:00:19 <dazinism> apksigner verify -verbose --print-certs name_of_the.apk
01:00:53 <dazinism> You'll need to transfer the apk into termux. Using the android devices file manager app
01:01:40 <dazinism> uhsa: you can use a usb lead to plug one android device into the other
01:01:53 <dazinism> And transfer files
01:02:30 <dazinism> Or maybe use bluetooth
01:02:57 <dazinism> USB lead is probably most secure
01:05:08 <uhsa> @dazinism so if i have another pixel i can just use the usb c to c
01:06:53 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> will vanadium ever get dark mode and adblock?
01:07:44 <ulmirdin[m]> It already has dark modep8tuahpirua5ra
01:16:36 <dazinism> uhsa: yeah usb c to usb c
01:16:57 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> what about dark like bromite where white webpages are dark
01:17:17 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> the dark mode on there isn't as good extension wise bromites uses an add-on I thini
01:17:19 <dazinism> p8tuahpirua5ra: can turn that on
01:17:25 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> how
01:18:10 <dazinism> p8tuahpirua5ra: chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark
01:18:21 <dazinism> It makes you more unique
01:18:47 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> so that's why it doesn't use it
01:19:03 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> its to blend in with all chrome users right?
01:19:19 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> what about using an adblock with it?
01:20:13 <dazinism> p8tuahpirua5ra: use private dns is the recommended way if you want add blockinh
01:20:26 <dazinism> Use a common block list
01:20:37 <dazinism> So you blend in as much as possible
01:23:12 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> where do you type in chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark
01:24:44 <uhsa> dazinism I installed using web usb install would it be difficult to revert to stock pixel to try command line install?
01:26:17 <sphinx[m]> you don't need to install stock OS  to try it
01:26:41 <dazinism> p8tuahpirua5ra: https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking-apps
01:27:54 <dazinism> uhsa: as Sphinx says. You can install over the top of what you have now, no real advantage going back go stock
01:28:05 <uhsa> oke thanks
01:28:08 <dazinism> *going back to stock
01:28:35 <uhsa> If i wanted to use vpn would it be better downloading the vpn app from aurora store or using openvpn client?
01:28:39 <dazinism> The web install is pretty safe
01:28:42 <uhsa> more secure*
01:29:26 <uhsa> dazinism Yes and i read that you can use a graphene pixel to make another one without a pc that sounds pretty cool
01:30:02 <dazinism> Some VPN apps use wirguard rather than openvpn
01:30:32 <dazinism> Wireguard is generally considered superior, although in some cases not as good for privacy
01:30:48 <uhsa> i have nord vpn right now i think it is openvpn
01:30:51 <dazinism> The better VPN service providers address that
01:31:22 <KONCRETE[m]> <uhsa "i have nord vpn right now i thin"> You should Try Mullvad
01:31:41 <KONCRETE[m]> Nord has shady written all over...
01:32:03 <KONCRETE[m]> Or you could just use Orbot but its too slow for the daily use
01:34:24 <dannyknoll3Danny> <KONCRETE[m] "You should Try Mullvad"> If they're a honeypot, they're going to need to get the fingerprints off of a lot of people's cash 😂
01:34:44 <dannyknoll3Danny> Mullvad is cool
01:35:58 <uhsa> KONCRETE[m] Should i install the mullvad app from aurora?
01:40:22 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I use mullvad. I got it off fdroid
01:40:48 <dazinism> uhsa: I don't use VPNs much. Think I'd probably use the open VPN app if I was using nord
01:42:02 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I use the swiss server using mullvads app. I think its the best vpn
01:42:29 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> nord is shady don't use it. they're on TV so forget them
01:42:53 <mhnoyes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_virtual_private_network_services
01:43:05 <dazinism> Yeah would probably use mullvads app with mullvad (though havent researched)
01:43:18 <timetravelingman> Mullvad is probably the best right now
01:43:40 <timetravelingman> Nord is for people who know nothing about VPNs
01:43:55 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> monero or cash payments and they just send you a 16 number account and you log in with that
01:44:05 <timetravelingman> Mullvad is the Patrician Choice (TM)
01:44:15 <uhsa> dazinism I am using nord right now but wanting to switch i am going to switch to mullvad, where can i find the openvpn app for nord and if i switch to mullvad would the app be better?
01:44:35 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> the mullvad app. it uses wireguard
01:44:59 <dazinism> FDroid have the openvpn app
01:45:03 <uhsa> p8tuahpirua5ra[m Yes they have so many payment methods amazing just they are based in sweden i dont know what to think of that
01:45:20 <timetravelingman> Sweden has really good privacy laws
01:45:38 <uhsa> dazinism is that the openvpn for android ?
01:45:43 <dazinism> uhsa: guess it depends a bit where you are
01:45:52 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> they have a Swiss and Sweden vpn. they don't have Iceland though
01:45:54 <mhnoyes> https://techshielder.com/best-vpn-for-wireguard
01:45:57 <timetravelingman> Bro just look up openvpn on fdroid
01:46:03 <timetravelingman> This is so easy
01:46:34 <dazinism> uhsa: yeah
01:47:00 <timetravelingman> Also I hate when people ask "does x app work on grapheneOS" like if you're already running GOS just... Download the app and try lmao
01:47:23 <timetravelingman> Bitches be like does my niche Scandinavian credit card company app work on GOS
01:47:41 <mhnoyes> timetravelingman: It would help to have a published list of known working apps.
01:47:47 <uhsa> timetravelingman everything alright mate...
01:47:58 <timetravelingman> No I'm not alright
01:48:08 <timetravelingman> Is anyone?
01:48:08 <dazinism> Guess some people want to know to decide if they'll move
01:48:27 <dazinism> I'm alright
01:48:35 <timetravelingman> No
01:48:37 <timetravelingman> You're all left
01:48:37 <dazinism> ....sometimes
01:48:38 <uhsa> me too learned alot today thanks guys

01:49:12 <t3ktn0nym0us[m]> Made the move earlier and do not regret it!
01:50:47 <dazinism> uhsa: hope you figure it all out. Come back if you need a hand. Theres normally folks who can help
02:08:38 <rinzlerfftu[m]> <timetravelingman "Bitches be like does my niche Sc"> Can't argue with this, you won't know until you try, but some users are so noob that they require excessive amounts of hand holding.
02:09:19 <rinzlerfftu[m]> We all had to start somewhere right?
02:09:36 <assratatouille[m> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "monero or cash payments and they"> funny that they dont actually accept xmr yet
02:10:58 <assratatouille[m> you gotta go through a site like changenow to exchange to btc

02:16:36 <rny> #grapheneos-offtopic pls
02:16:36 <assratatouille[m> they dont support monero
02:16:49 <assratatouille[m> woops
02:16:53 <assratatouille[m> thought this was off topic
02:17:03 <dannyknoll3Danny> <assratatouille[m "thought this was off topic"> this
02:18:23 <rinzlerfftu[m]> <zzxx123_ "rinzlerfftu or getting too used "> I know exactly what you mean. I had to deal with this at work in a previous position. It gets to be stressful. Little birds have to learn how to fly on their own, eventually!
02:29:27 <rosie> Yeah, it pretty much IS off-topic (so is the discussion of VPNs), but apparent the mods are AFK.
02:33:49 <uhsa> I downloaded the signal app from the signal site and in the aurora store it says update? Is the signal apk on the website not the latest version and does it update itself?
02:36:20 <kiwisign> Quick question: if a purchased for cash from 3rd party Pixel3 phone (Android11) has the Enable OEM unlocking greyed out, then is all hope lost?

02:41:32 <rinzlerfftu[m]> I'm not sure if it is behind the Aurora Store or Google Play version, however.
02:41:40 <entry1[m]> <kiwisign "I have not conntected to WiFI, n"> Connect it to WiFi and restart the device. The IMEI for the unlocked variant begins with "99" I believe
02:42:28 <sphinx[m]> uhsa: the website distribution is updated last on purpose
02:43:07 <uhsa> Thanks everyone !
02:47:06 <kiwisign> IMEI does begin with 99
02:48:40 <entry1[m]> kiwisign any luck? You need to connect to WiFi and restart the device (sometimes twice) in order to enable OEM unlocking if the feature is available
02:48:44 <kiwisign> Connecting to WIFI allowed me to unlock OEM unlocking. Thank you sphinx.
02:49:25 <Clutchward> Does GrapheneOS have trusted locations tkaen out?
02:53:22 <kiwisign> Thank you entry1[m] that did the trick.  And thanks to strcat[m] for the hard work of implementing Web install. Looking over it now: Wow such streamlining
02:54:29 <kiwisign> And to all others who've helped with this project, thanks to you as well.
02:56:52 <rosie> trusted locations taken out of what?  GrapheneOS treats all networks as hostile/untrusted.
03:02:37 <Clutchward> No I mean the thing where you don't have to unlock the phone if you're in that trusted location
03:03:03 <Clutchward> I don't know what it is. I've seen others use it, I assume it's an easy way to get access to the phone so it's removed
03:03:12 <rinzlerfftu[m]> Smart Lock, no?
03:03:36 <rinzlerfftu[m]> At least I think that's what it's called. Memory is hazy from stock Pixel days.
03:04:07 <entry1[m]> <kiwisign "And to all others who've helped "> Yeah the developers are beasts. No problem and welcome to the community! Hope you enjoy your device!
03:04:49 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <rinzlerfftu[m] "Smart Lock, no?"> Doesn't seem to be in AOSP in the first place (need to confirm)
03:10:13 <kiwisign> Thanks entry1[m]. I'm gonna hang here as I check out the Web Install implementation. May have some additional questions, thanks again!

06:04:04 <rinzlerfftu[m]> You might be able to use Google TTS but I'm not sure on that one and is probably not what you are looking for anyway if you are using GrapheneOS.

06:35:25 <zooobla[m]> Anyone else have this or is my phone compromised? I get it with official google builds. Both with locked bootloaders
06:39:34 <shurke> zooobla[m]: i don't use vanadium and mine looks like the latter two screenshots
06:40:00 <shurke> an i have zero wifi usage of vanadium
06:41:12 <zooobla[m]> I get it for all apps even with usage. Just seems off to me since it worked until recently and the fact even trying android 10 didn't fix it
06:41:55 * zooobla[m] uploaded an image: (82KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wkquMxJrVVcqkDOndrTOxTlI/Screenshot_20210319-041144.png >
06:43:47 <zooobla[m]> That's now during this chat after sending all that. I can see it in WiFi but I'm wondering if anyone else has usage show up for their apps or its persistent malware trying to hide usage that survives factory image flashing and the security features of the titan chip
06:46:37 <shurke> yeah that's strange
06:46:52 <shurke> my element client shows the few mb usage i've had
06:47:40 <shurke> and under the element icon on that mobile data and Wi-Fi page is a selection for a timerange, which is missing on your screenshot
06:51:14 <zooobla[m]> I have a one plus one as well and it even survived a leaked EDL image flash. I think it got in threw the WiFi as that phone had a dead battery for a while but I'm only speculating
06:51:42 <zooobla[m]> I also seen it on every android device that was ever on my wifi so I assume it also acts as a worm
06:52:28 <zooobla[m]> It went past Samsung Knox and the titan m even on devices that just do stock like my parents
06:54:53 <zooobla[m]> My DNS was also being hijacked on all operating systems, I use gnu/Linux, chromeos, Macos, windows 7, and windows 10. It would try to keep my browsers at a lower version but funny enough I could get past it with google secure dns. Cloudflare seemed to be intercepted
06:56:33 <zooobla[m]> My chromeos  pixelbook for example says it was activated in October 2021 so they bypassed the titan c chip in that  and its brand new. They also had it so I couldn't disable JavaScript for example. I have a video of what's going on
06:58:25 <zooobla[m]> I also had a offline thinkpad t60 running temoleos and somehow they got into that and deleted all my programing work. I physically removed all networking from the device and it never left my sight. So I'm wondering if theres a hidden wireless backdoor on all devices. Unless someone broke in I guess

07:13:12 <zooobla[m]> Mine doesn't let me reinstall from the same disc I installed from. I also have 1% more CPU usage about 20 more context swaps a second
07:14:32 <zooobla[m]> I think you can tell when they get in only on something giving you all the data templeos does of the cores. I know Linux has a way for the context swaps to ve viewed but it isn't as stable as templeos and its from ring3

07:15:54 <zooobla[m]> I said all that because if I'm compromised already there's no incentive to hide what else is going on
07:16:16 <strcat[m]> you're saying a lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense

07:16:49 <strcat[m]> you posted a video from ChromeOS
07:16:57 <zooobla[m]> All my apps do that. So something is doing it to hide data since other people already said there's doesn't do that
07:16:58 <strcat[m]> what you're saying doesn't make sense and isn't a good fit for this channel
07:18:11 <zooobla[m]> Yes I understand some is unrelated to the OS but the first part of what I said is. And so is that screenshot showing all my apps aren't reporting usage

07:19:10 <strcat[m]> that's what happens if stats are reset
07:19:36 <zooobla[m]> I didn't reset the stats. Its a clean install with my usage since then
07:19:42 <strcat[m]> look, what you're saying really doesn't make sense, this isn't a sign of any compromise
07:20:03 <strcat[m]> please stop filling the channel with this
07:21:02 <strcat[m]> the fact that you're talking about templeos makes it pretty clear this is trolling
07:21:09 <zooobla[m]> You can literally see element showing usage in the screenshot than the page of the app has nothing
07:21:26 <merelyme> I most definitely want to put this on my phone but it looks like it will be stuck with Android for a little while longer. The OLED cracked and turned purple and blue the whole screen,.
07:22:28 <strcat[m]> alright, great
07:22:33 <strcat[m]> you aren't compromised and it's not appropriate for this channel
07:24:19 <zooobla[m]> So because I can program in holy-c I'm a troll? Not everyone uses that as a joke it has a fully functional public domain compiler. I was writing my own operating system when all this started. Also why is all this happening while my brand new Chromebook says it wsd activated in Oct 2021?
07:24:40 <strcat[m]> sounds like the time was set wrong
07:24:54 <strcat[m]> but as is my experience with past stuff like this you aren't a reliable narrator about what you say is going on
07:25:05 <merelyme> hmm i dont know.../..... if you bought a chromebook. wouldnt you expect it to run chrome?
07:25:43 <zooobla[m]> Chromebooks can run templeos if you put seabios on it
07:26:15 <strcat[m]> if you want to debug whatever is wrong with usage stats in GrapheneOS that's on-topic
07:26:16 <strcat[m]> the rest isn't
07:26:43 <strcat[m]> if that's genuinely happening then the reason is probably that you messed around with special access permissions for OS components
07:26:49 <strcat[m]> such as removing usage stats access from OS components
07:27:32 <zooobla[m]> No, It happened to me on my old linageos phone and on clean flashes of a factory image and playing around in them to see if that stats came back
07:27:44 <strcat[m]> and you probably did the same thing on both
07:27:56 <strcat[m]> you likely disabled usage stats for an OS component or broke something in a similar way
07:28:08 <zooobla[m]> Why would I reset usage stats if a factory image to test what is going on?
07:28:08 <strcat[m]> the common factor is that you were using both devices and very likely did the same kind of broken configuration
07:28:20 <strcat[m]> I didn't say you reset it
07:28:31 <strcat[m]> I said you probably messed with permissions of OS components, or disabled OS components
07:28:39 <strcat[m]> it sounds like that's probably what you've done
07:29:32 <zooobla[m]> Well I just had it how it booted and connected to WiFi  and played around with the system browser
07:29:53 <strcat[m]> which explains the data usage for the browser
07:30:22 <zooobla[m]> It's zero in the app usage but shows in the WiFi or cellular usage if you manually go through settings
07:30:29 <strcat[m]> ok
07:30:43 <strcat[m]> again not an indication of an compromise of any kind
07:30:55 <strcat[m]> more likely an indication you toggled off usage stats permission
07:31:06 <strcat[m]> did you change permissions in the Settings app and/or disable OS components?
07:31:11 <zooobla[m]> No
07:32:21 <zooobla[m]> I even went to google support with it  when i was testing stock and they didn't know what was otg and sent me a page to see usage in settings which is the only place it worked
07:45:47 <zooobla[m]> I was using grapheneos for a number of months and one day it just stopped showing usage in the combined app usage page. Which is when I tried factory images of aosp, stock, and grapheneos. I had to take everything off my network and use Google DNS for chrome to even let me install any of the factory images. I was using the same config the entire time and then used stock while testing
07:47:15 <zooobla[m]> Google DNS over TLS* if I didn't use encrypted DNS or used cloudflare DNS over tls it wouldn't let me download the images
07:47:23 <strcat> it sounds more like the feature not working as you expect or a configuration issue
07:47:27 <strcat> DNS thing is something else
07:47:43 <strcat> and that's out of scope of this issue
07:47:50 <strcat> it's not related
07:47:52 <zooobla[m]> It's unrelated to the feature but related to downloading and installing grapheneos
08:00:35 <zooobla[m]> I added that part to show the trouble I've had installing the operating system to actually verify it was persistent on all factory images regardless of them being grapheneos or not
08:02:31 <strcat[m]> you're really interpreting the issue in a strange way and jumping to really unjustified conclusions about things
08:02:37 <strcat[m]> and connecting all these things together
08:03:02 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's going to be productive trying to figure out what could be wrong (if anything) based on the response to my attempt to start doing that
08:03:20 <strcat[m]> don't want to hear about issues with unrelated things
08:03:31 <strcat[m]> not everything is connected
08:04:20 <zooobla[m]> It isn't strange if you're politically active and making an operating system with its own compiler nobody can get into without a hardware backdoor. I have to assume all the threats are related as they destroyed my work and intercepted my communications
08:05:22 <strcat[m]> right... they destroyed this OS you made where you had no backups
08:05:34 <strcat[m]> is this back to the TempleOS thing?
08:05:49 <zooobla[m]> They destroyed the install and the computer. I actually was writing a Linux based operating system
08:06:11 <zooobla[m]> I was porting Linux to compile with the templeos compiler and build everything from source
08:07:02 <zooobla[m]> How grapheneos comes into this is because I was using signal so they probably had to hack my phone to see what I was saying
08:08:46 <rny> trolling is off-topic in #grapheneos
08:08:55 <rny> zooobla[m]: ^
08:09:08 <rny> pls take it to #grapheneos-offtopic
08:10:35 <zooobla[m]> I'm not trolling I'm defending myself when you're saying I'm not compromised when I literally wrote an operating system that compiles itself in seconds
08:11:12 <rny> regardless whatever it is you're saying is offtopic
08:12:44 <zooobla[m]> I have to talk about the problems installing the operating system so people are aware and use secure DNS with certificate pinning and they know what to look for
08:13:32 <zooobla[m]> I couldn't diagnose the problem as persistent without reinstalling the operating system from a factory image multiple times
08:14:11 <rny> how are these issues related to #grapheneos?
08:15:10 <zooobla[m]> I couldn't install it at all without using secure DNS with pinning. My main issue was my WiFi and cellular usage doesn't show up at all. Which to me seems like flawed malware

08:17:02 <rny> collect a bugreport and send it to security⊙go
08:17:52 <rny> that screenshot doesnt really prove anything
08:18:17 <zooobla[m]> What's the best way to do that? I don't believe it's on everyone else's devices as prior in the chat people confirmed it was working for them
08:18:43 <strcat[m]> there's again no reason to think there's any compromise / malware
08:18:53 <strcat[m]> based on stats not working the way you expect
08:19:12 <strcat[m]> > I was porting Linux to compile with the templeos compiler and build everything from source
08:19:25 <zooobla[m]> So someone programs in a stats page that does nothing for a production operating system?
08:19:26 <strcat[m]> also some of the stuff you say... makes it pretty clear you are either trolling really hard or making stuff up
08:20:13 <zooobla[m]> Why would I make something up? Linux is C, templeos compiles C and C++ like gcc
08:20:30 <rny> what does ^ have to do with the issues you've just described
08:20:31 <somenerd[m]> again, what?
08:20:31 <zooobla[m]> I'm not porting a car game, I'm porting a kernel
08:21:00 <zooobla[m]> You said I was trolling. So I told you what the compiler does
08:23:20 <strcat[m]> it doesn't compile C and particularly not C++
08:23:50 <strcat[m]> you really expect us to believe that you have ported Linux to the TempleOS dialect of C, lol? and for me to take that seriously?
08:23:56 <strcat[m]> it just comes across as trolling

08:24:13 <rny> i stopped reading when author talks about HolyC and etc.
08:24:17 <zooobla[m]> You're confusing C with the standard library. It does C++ but not the standard library you are use to
08:24:22 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_A._Davis for people unfamiliar
08:24:34 <rny> zooobla[m]: are you Terry?
08:24:40 <strcat[m]> it doesn't compile C++ at all
08:24:49 <strcat[m]> anyway just comes across as trolling
08:25:00 <strcat[m]> getting tired of it
08:25:06 <zooobla[m]> Holy-C is C++ with bloat removed. He called it that because he was schizophrenic
08:25:06 <rny> or Terry's friend
08:25:24 <zooobla[m]> You can change the library to standard C++ if you choose ti
08:25:50 <strcat[m]> except it's not C++
08:25:54 <strcat[m]> and couldn't use the C++ standard library
08:26:11 <strcat[m]> anyway, in general, what you're doing comes across as someone making up stuff
08:26:16 <zooobla[m]> Not unless you are a programmer and make it your own, no
08:26:37 <strcat[m]> stubbornant: that depends a lot on the web site
08:26:40 <strcat[m]> stubbornant: for 2nd thing
08:27:04 <strcat[m]> stubbornant: different ways to play media
08:27:06 <strcat[m]> in a browser
08:27:25 <strcat[m]> stubbornant: wire is supposed to have push without Play
08:27:33 <zooobla[m]> Holy-C is because terry was schizophrenic it still doesn't take away he wrote his own compiler which is useful on its own even if you don't care for templeos
08:27:43 <zooobla[m]> He called it C+ before he was sicker
08:27:45 <strcat[m]> stubbornant: try https://wire.com/en/download/ instead of via Play Store
08:27:51 <strcat[m]> stubbornant: maybe their releases are different
08:29:33 <zooobla[m]> You shouldn't hate on someone just because you think mental illness means they can't do anything. Templeos is impressive for one person to make, even if the games are probably not going to be played and you can easily make it work in 1080p or higher if you're a programmer if you cared to use it
08:32:52 <strcat[m]> pretty sure that's just a troll
08:32:57 <strcat[m]> some weird form of concern trolling
08:34:51 <shurke> strcat[m]: i applaude your patience with such kind of people

08:44:23 <strcat[m]> it shows the logo for the hardware and then the OS logo
08:44:25 <strcat[m]> you can't remove either
08:44:45 <strcat[m]>  * it shows the logo for the hardware and then the OS boot animation
08:44:51 <strcat[m]> you could use a different boot animation if you did your own builds

09:42:27 <strcat[m]> it's still not really clear what you mean
09:42:52 <strcat[m]> and it's entirely possible a device manager screwed something up persistently
09:44:28 <strcat[m]> when you have some problem specific to you that no one else has ever encountered, it is probably something you did
09:44:43 <kradav[m]> should i reset the phone to factory settings and test it again?
09:44:54 <strcat[m]> better to figure out what is causing it
09:45:21 <strcat[m]> kradav: is this on owner profile or secondary user
09:45:22 <strcat[m]> 1st of all
09:45:28 <kradav[m]> owner
09:45:51 <strcat[m]> which device model?

10:22:48 <battlepad[m]> lads is it just me or does google translate always crash in grapheneOS without network permission?
10:23:12 <battlepad[m]> yes i know google bad but due to my work i really need a translation app that is super reliable and just works
10:23:27 <M647509735485097> If it automatically crashes I'm assuming it requires the permission
10:23:44 <battlepad[m]> also notable is that when i deny internet permissions to google translate on my huawei (emui) device, the app still functions though
10:23:51 <M647509735485097> Why not just use the web version and pin it to your home?
10:23:57 <battlepad[m]> EMUI's built in firewall
10:24:13 <battlepad[m]> <M647509735485097 "Why not just use the web version"> actl that sounds not bad
10:25:11 <M647509735485097> I do that for a bunch of apps. No need for the permissions when I can just use the browser  and not have to worry
10:26:48 <battlepad[m]> wow the PWA works pretty well for translate

13:25:10 <strcat[m]> for other things implemented by apps, that's entirely up to them, has little to do with the OS
13:25:18 <strcat[m]>  * for other things implemented by apps, that's entirely up to them, and has little to do with the OS

13:26:47 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: it is not how we would do a keyboard if it was an app that we made

13:30:12 <strcat[m]> we're well aware the AOSP keyboard is far from a modern keyboard
13:30:26 <strcat[m]> but other than in text boxes this is an app UI decision
13:30:47 <strcat[m]> in text boxes it's mostly a keyboard UI decision other than the app being able to trivially enable showing undo in the context menu
13:30:51 <mynacol[m]> zeothgze: Sorry, forgot one step. Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile connection (?) > "advanced" > WiFi Calling
13:31:00 <strcat[m]> the OS itself has undo for text boxes as a standard thing
13:32:14 <strcat[m]> Android 6 added undo/redo for text boxes including standard physical keyboard shortcuts
13:32:31 <strcat[m]> for virtual keyboards, yeah, they probably mostly don't have a ctrl key and mostly don't add buttons for undo/redo
13:32:36 <strcat[m]> or other functionality that's available
13:32:38 <strcat[m]> but it's there
13:32:45 <strcat[m]> if the keyboard has a way to do ctrl you can do undo/redo via that
13:33:09 <strcat[m]> it's just traditional undo/redo though, not some fancy undo tree feature
13:33:22 <strcat[m]> i.e. if you undo 5 times then write 1 character, you can't get back what you did
13:33:39 <zeothgze[m]> <mynacol[m] "zeothgze: Sorry, forgot one step"> Funny, I don't find those menus on my pixel 4a. :-/
13:34:10 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: anyway if it's a keyboard with ctrl it essentially has it
13:34:32 <mynacol[m]> The WiFi calling option might not be visible, exactly
13:35:04 <mynacol[m]> * zeothgze  WiFi calling option might not be visible, exactly
13:36:56 <M647509735485097> Do manufactures' create their own keyboards? Samsung, Google, etc. I did see that certain Samsung phones allow a specific kind of swipe to pull up the undo option on the stock keyboard... But is that baked into their tailored OS or a keyboard they created for their phone
13:38:52 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: most just ship Gboard but they can make their own, some do
13:39:49 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: Google Keyboard used to be an extended variant of AOSP keyboard but then they made Gboard as a cross-platform (iOS and Android) replacement
13:39:58 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: iirc it was iOS first
13:41:07 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: so, AOSP keyboard is missing a lot of useful things, like swipe across spacebar to move the cursor (useful for copy/paste), etc.
13:41:18 <strcat[m]> modern emoji support, swipe typing, etc
13:41:30 <strcat[m]> AOSP keyboard is meant to be replaced by OEMs
13:41:34 <strcat[m]> either with their own or Gboard
13:41:49 <strcat[m]> similar to most other high-level AOSP apps
13:42:04 <M647509735485097> Gotcha. Will be on the hunt for viable privacy-friendly options
13:42:06 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't really aim to provide high level apps anymore
13:42:13 <strcat[m]> since there is a huge app ecosystem
13:42:22 <strcat[m]> and it's just assumed no one really wants some shitty app from AOSP anyway
13:42:27 <strcat[m]> we just lack resources of a typical Android vendor
13:42:35 <M647509735485097> Or I'll just refuse to highlight text with fears of deletion lol
13:43:01 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: get a little bluetooth or usb-c keyboard?
13:43:06 <strcat[m]> shrug
13:43:25 <strcat[m]> we have the same modern physical keyboard support :P
13:43:43 <strcat[m]> we just need to have a new virtual keyboard made from scratch
13:43:51 <strcat[m]> privacy/security-focused one that's actually good
13:43:56 <strcat[m]> not a priority
13:44:47 <strcat[m]> the issue with replacing AOSP keyboard is that as with most other categories of apps, while there are 'better' open source ones, they tend to not care about privacy and especially security
13:44:54 <strcat[m]> and also licensing issues, on top of that
13:45:18 <strcat[m]> in general, it's going to be pretty hard to find any third party app we could bundle, due to the high standards expected
13:45:25 <strcat[m]> so we'd have to have new apps developed
13:45:32 <strcat[m]> or just not bundle that kind of app (our approach in general)
13:45:40 <strcat[m]> (but obviously not an option for a keyboard)
13:46:01 <strcat[m]> 647509735485097255950x: most third party keyboards also don't bother implementing stuff like Direct Boot support to actually be full replacements
13:46:09 <strcat[m]> i.e. they won't work before first unlock without access to their data
13:46:26 <strcat[m]> have the same issue with third party text-to-speech apps like RHVoice
13:46:54 <strcat[m]> we want to include a TTS app like RHVoice so that blind users can use GrapheneOS out of the box but they don't bother making it usable pre-first-unlock via Direct Boot
13:47:17 <strcat[m]> also just tend to have questionable security, usability issues, etc.
13:47:23 <strcat[m]> good apps are... rare

14:02:54 <SoftoLibre> Hello, I was wondering if there are plans to bring back the stock Android calendar app to Graphene. Right now, Calendar is listed in the settings menu as a system app, and you can use it via a widget, but the Calendar app is not in the launcher. The Github thread wasn't really clear as to whether or not this is just temporary or a permanent removal of the app.
14:04:02 <strcat[m]> the app exists to provide handling of viewing calendar events, etc. via other apps
14:04:07 <strcat[m]> not to be a usable calendar app for users
14:04:25 <strcat[m]> so we removed the launcher icon to avoid confusion
14:04:39 <strcat[m]>  * so we removed the launcher shortcut to avoid confusion
14:04:58 <strcat[m]> can't be removed since it's needed to provide default handling of those intents
14:05:39 <strcat[m]> and also note that it's a calendar viewer/editor, not a calendar provider
14:05:54 <SoftoLibre> Ah, okay, so if my workflow on my old device was to use my caldav server with the default Android app, should I just use a different calendar app that I download from F-Droid or something?
14:06:10 <strcat[m]> just use a proper app like Etar
14:06:24 <strcat[m]> that one is not really meant to actually be usable
14:07:19 <SoftoLibre> Okay, I will try that out and see how it goes. Thanks

14:23:36 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: that's your carrier
14:23:56 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: by default there isn't a carrier
14:24:28 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: you've inserted a SIM and therefore configured the device to use that carrier's network via the appropriate APN configuration, etc.

14:25:45 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: and note texts, calls, etc. all go via data on LTE and above, so the OS will make those connections, since the OS implements it
14:26:37 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi calling, VoLTE, and other carrier things are not activated by default since by default there's no carrier, but sure the OS uses modern data-based services whenever support by carriers
14:26:57 <strcat[m]> as required to continue having working carrier-based functionality like texts/calls headed into the future as 2G/3G support is phased out
14:27:05 <strcat[m]> no such thing as non-data-based LTE calls/texts, etc.

14:33:06 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: you can figure out which service it is based on that (try APN configuration page on the device first, or the carrier debugging menu)
14:33:43 <strcat[m]> there are generally meant to be toggles for Wi-Fi calling etc. but we don't have that entirely set up yet and also over the long term VoLTE, etc. is not optional unless you simply don't want carrier-based call support at all
14:34:00 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling are not really significantly different, and also 5G voice is the same thing too
14:34:49 <strcat[m]> zeothgze: carriers *choose* to make this all seem like different stuff for marketing and product differentiation purposes but really with LTE services like calls, texts, etc. just moved to being data-based via IMS/SIP

17:18:46 <illumanticonfirm> > GPLv3 forbids making a device with an immutable root of trust which we don't want to disallow
17:18:46 <illumanticonfirm> It doesn't, it prevents you from using it on devices you can't change the key on. Pixel phones for example are fine for gplv3 code and have security to verify the manufactures key is used vs another
17:19:38 <illumanticonfirm> There's no point of buying a locked down device you can't run alternative software on unless you're special ordering for enterprise which the gplv3 allows
17:20:28 <illumanticonfirm> IBM for example uses GPLv3 code in their distributions which are heavily used in enterprise
17:35:23 <illumanticonfirm> I believe Chromebooks ship with GPLv3 code aswell and they have some of the best consumer security out of the box. Do "bash --version" on chromeos shell

18:06:32 <illumanticonfirm> * > So i clicked reboot to bootloader and fastboot:error: failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable
18:06:32 <illumanticonfirm> That means fastbootd isn't detected by your browser or fastboot CLI
18:06:43 <pkgbuild[m]> ok i try to update it
18:08:36 <illumanticonfirm> You can manually use fastbootd with "fastboot update  ZIP" if you enter recovery to select it with CLI
18:09:07 <illumanticonfirm> Do fastboot devices to verify the device is showing up and if there is permission issues. Webusb is the easiest way to install however
18:13:14 <pkgbuild[m]> nice it also verify inside the browser im doing this to zero with web interface, fun.
18:15:13 <pkgbuild[m]>  * nice it also self verify inside the browser im doing this to zero with web interface, fun.
18:15:32 <strcat> you're not supposed to use adb
18:15:37 <strcat> and if you did run adb you need to kill it
18:15:40 <strcat> rebooting is one option
18:16:22 <pkgbuild[m]> i've been tried chief didn't worked
18:16:36 <pkgbuild[m]> im trying with chromium
18:16:39 <strcat> make sure to read what it says about USB on the page
18:16:47 <strcat> make sure you don't have an adb process running too
18:17:21 <pkgbuild[m]> right i could have leave one process behind
18:17:57 <strcat[m]> use the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes with the phone ideally
18:18:04 <strcat[m]> make sure it's plugged in snugly, try different USB port
18:18:17 <strcat[m]> if you're using a USB-A to USB-C cable chances are that's the problem, most of those are broken
18:18:30 <strcat[m]> the #1 issue people have is faulty USB cables/ports
18:19:44 <timetravelingman> I'm the guy breaking all of them
18:20:14 <timetravelingman> Nothing personal. *breaks your USB cable*
18:20:36 <pkgbuild[m]> maybe i just leave try chromium?
18:20:41 <pkgbuild[m]> its been an hour i think
18:21:55 <pkgbuild[m]> strcat: yes i am using an USB-A to USB-C but i am pretty sure to have used this with the 3a and worked well
18:22:08 <strcat> pkgbuild[m]: try diff USB port, try flipping way cable is plugged into phone
18:22:12 <strcat> and plug in really snugly
18:22:26 <pkgbuild[m]> ok 😁👍️
18:27:05 <ducinaltum> strcat: your suggestion about adb solved my installation process
18:27:15 <ducinaltum> thank you !!
18:27:17 * pkgbuild[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XGysxOGNGKnelxEPfPzcNvIR/message.txt >
18:28:24 <ducinaltum> I killed adb process and changed usb-a to usb-c and flash goes until the end (y) (y)
18:32:05 <pkgbuild[m]> oh okay i think i have the same issue of ducinaltum im stuck on androd tool 30 i will try to reboot or change pc with an usb c port
20:46:08 <chocolatebarbrai> Hi, Is location purposefully disabled in the mobile browers? I couldn't see my location in wego.here.com in vanadium or bromite, even after giving permission.
20:46:47 <strcat> no
20:47:01 <strcat> but the implementation on the sites or Chromium's implementation may have issues without Play services
20:47:04 <strcat> might need work
20:48:43 <chocolatebarbrai> that makes sense, thank you
20:58:43 <marshall10> hello guys, i have a problem to unlock my pixel 3a with web installer
20:59:15 <marshall10> im using google chrome web browser
20:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy marshall10, let me see if I can help you out a tad bit. Have you enabled OEM unlocking in the operating system?
21:00:09 <marshall10> im using ubuntu
21:00:35 <marshall10> forgot to write that detail
21:00:49 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, great, Chrome (*not* Chromium) on Ubuntu should work.
21:01:17 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to enable OEM unlocking, and then reboot to fastboot so that the website can talk to the fastboot bootloader.
21:01:22 <marshall10> phone is open for developing
21:01:33 <TheJollyRoger> Great, have you enabled OEM unlocking?
21:01:33 <marshall10> 7 times tap on the about settings
21:01:48 <marshall10> in my phone meny
21:01:49 <marshall10> menu
21:02:14 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, have you enabled OEM unlocking in the developer options?
21:02:31 <marshall10> no, can you help me to do it ?
21:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, the process is here: https://grapheneos.org/install/web , but I'll walk you through it.
21:03:16 <TheJollyRoger> First, I want you go to "Settings"
21:03:22 <TheJollyRoger> (On your phone)
21:03:32 <marshall10> yes, im alredy at that web page
21:03:44 <TheJollyRoger> Look at "Enabling OEM Unlocking"
21:03:50 <TheJollyRoger> Did you read the whole thing before you began?
21:04:34 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#enabling-oem-unlocking
21:04:38 <marshall10> yes , and try few times and didnt work ,because of that - i wanted to chat here ... il do it now as you sad
21:04:40 <marshall10> said
21:04:42 <marshall10> just a sec
21:04:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I will walk you through the process.
21:06:01 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know when you're ready to have a go.
21:06:32 <EinLurch> Hello, I just successfully installed Graphene, and checked with two other phones the auditor. Everything seems well so far, but everytime I boot, I get a message which tells me to go to g.co/ABH.
21:06:33 <EinLurch> I checked the logs and there were two people which experienced this, but they had a non-working install. Is this message expected?
21:06:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy EinLurch, yes, this is normal and expected behaviour.
21:06:56 <marshall10> oh yes i alredy did oem open
21:07:31 <TheJollyRoger> EinLurch: what the phone is telling you is that it's telling you that verified boot is on, enabled, and enforcing, but the operating system is being verified to keys that don't belong to Google's.
21:07:46 <TheJollyRoger> EinLurch: if that message didn't appear, you would be loading the Google operating system.
21:07:58 <marshall10> what to do next when my OEM is open ?
21:08:01 <EinLurch> Ah, I was afraid this is some kind of warning it failed integrity checks - maybe Ill add it to the installation docs if it is open for editing. Thank you for your explanation and time
21:08:08 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: alright. I want you to run the following command in terminal;
21:08:24 <TheJollyRoger> sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common
21:08:34 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: once you've run that, reboot your PC.
21:09:11 <EinLurch> One last follow-up: is it possible to turn off the message? I am aware this is a minor nitpick and not even an inconvenience, but it does look scary
21:09:11 <marshall10> i alredy did it, but ill did it again now
21:09:57 <TheJollyRoger> EinLurch: Yep, anytime! No, it's not possible to disable that message. Although it's ominous, it's an important bootloader security feature. It's only if it turns orange and says "Software Integrity is Not guaranteed!" that you need to worry.
21:10:23 <TheJollyRoger> EinLurch: when the project gains its own hardware, hopefully what we'll be able to do,
21:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> is to have our own keys fused to the secure element as first-party keys, rather than third party ones.
21:11:25 <TheJollyRoger> But we would need to build our own handsets for that and GrapheneOS would need to become its own OEM or another OEM would need to co-operate with us to have that happen.
21:11:40 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: Welcome back, ready to continue?
21:11:44 <marshall10> here i im. i rebooted my comp again
21:11:47 <marshall10> yes
21:12:03 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: Alright, I want you to unplug your phone and switch it off for just one moment.
21:12:04 <EinLurch> Exciting really to see where the project goes, but cooperating with a company didnt go to well iirc :D
21:12:16 <TheJollyRoger> EinLurch: Hee hee... yeah...
21:12:19 <TheJollyRoger> >_<
21:12:25 <marshall10> ok ?
21:12:42 <EinLurch> Anyway, thanks again for your swift answers and enjoy your day/night/time of day!
21:13:05 <marshall10> my phone is off
21:13:35 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: Alright, open up Chrome and go back to https://grapheneos.org/install/web on your computer. Now, on your phone, I want you to press and hold down the volume key, then once you hear the click, press and hold down the power key, and keep both of those held down, until you see a black screen with white text on it that says "fastboot." As soon as you do, let go of the buttons
21:13:49 <TheJollyRoger> EinLurch: Yarr, have a good day/night shipmate!
21:14:03 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: Let me know when you see it.
21:14:29 <marshall10> im in fastboot mode now
21:14:38 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: alright, plug it in.
21:14:49 <marshall10> ok
21:15:02 <marshall10> pluged in...
21:15:20 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: Ok, quick sanity check here. Are you using the Google branded cable, or a USB 3.1 gen 1 or later A-to-C cable made by Anker or Aukey?
21:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> Most other USB cables don't have the wire(s) that fastboot or fastboot.js on the computer needs to talk to the bootloader on the phone.
21:17:09 <marshall10> i really dont know what kind of brand it is, because i I bought it yesterday from some random guy online :)
21:17:41 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: We can still try it, but it may or may not work.
21:17:48 <marshall10> lets try
21:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Place your phone flat on the desk screen side up, and make sure both ends of the cable are plugged in nice and snug.
21:18:24 <marshall10> okay
21:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> (Note that there are other reasons that this can fail - bad USB slots on the computer, incomplete USB firmware support on the motherboard usually results in flashing failing.)
21:18:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I want you to hit "Unlock bootloader" on the website.
21:18:47 <marshall10> i saw some notification bar pixel3a when i connected it to pc
21:19:17 <marshall10> i receive some message on my phone
21:19:23 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: You won't want the operating system running when you do this. If the operating system is running, then the phone's not in its bootloader interface.
21:19:28 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, look at your phone.
21:19:32 <marshall10> and i can chose unlock or dont unlock
21:19:48 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to use the arrow keys to switch between -- yes. Choose "unlock" and tap and release the power button to confirm.
21:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> Now, if you've made it this far, you are looking good.
21:20:00 <marshall10> ok
21:20:12 <marshall10> it is unlocked now
21:20:21 <TheJollyRoger> Past this point, if the flashing fails, or is incomplete, it's either the fault of your cables, OR your PC's motherboard.
21:20:55 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, are you back on the black screen that says fastboot, but it now says something about the bootloader being unlocked?
21:21:12 <marshall10> yes
21:21:19 <marshall10> device state : unlocked
21:21:50 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Don't disturb the phone - look back at the browser. The next button "Obtaining Factory Images" I want you to click it.
21:22:07 <TheJollyRoger> It will likely ask you to interact with the Pixel 3a again -- you must NOT be in Incognito mode when you do this.
21:22:15 <marshall10> downloading....
21:22:33 <TheJollyRoger> (If you are in Incognito mode at any point along the installation, the browser will clear the cache before the operating system has been fully installed, resulting in an error.)
21:23:28 <TheJollyRoger> The file is roughly 800MB of highly compressed binary data so this can take some time depending on how fast your connection is.
21:24:18 <marshall10> how to know if im in incognito mode ? what is incognito mode ?
21:24:29 <marshall10> file downloaded....
21:25:12 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: If you're in private mode, which discards all browsing data from your computer once you close the window. The window banner at the top may be darker than normal. Edge displays "In Private" on one side.
21:25:27 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: alright, the next step, I want you to click "Flash Release" on your browser.
21:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> After you check you're not in Private Mode.
21:26:06 <TheJollyRoger> If you're in Private mode you'll need to open a new window, and do the step "Obtaining factory images" again.
21:26:38 <marshall10> my top baner in ubuntu is black color
21:26:57 <TheJollyRoger> Click "Flash release."
21:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> Now.
21:27:38 <marshall10> ok
21:27:39 <TheJollyRoger> You must NOT disturb the phone.
21:27:41 <marshall10> clicked
21:27:57 <marshall10> screend on the phone flashing
21:28:07 <TheJollyRoger> It will show several odd screens on its display, including one that says "fastbootd" and presents a menu in blue text... if you see that, that means data is being written to the phone.
21:28:15 <TheJollyRoger> *Don't* touch it while this is happening.
21:28:44 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise it won't have a chance to write down everything, and you'll end up with an incomplete install and you will need to start the process again.
21:29:08 <marshall10> okay im waiting and dont tuching my phone
21:29:19 <marshall10> it is currently in fastbootd mode now
21:29:31 <marshall10> grapheneos fastboot
21:29:38 <TheJollyRoger> Great, it's working! When it's done, it'll return you to that black fastboot screen with "device unlocked"
21:30:01 <TheJollyRoger> Don't touch it while you see it in "fastbootd" mode with the blue text, that means it's installing.
21:30:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D​4v1dH> Mozilla Firefox will never ever support WebUSB because they deem as "harmful". See https://mozilla.github.io/standards-position/#webusb for details.
21:30:28 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone will automatically restart to the bootloader when all is through.
21:30:49 <TheJollyRoger> @D4v1dH - oh sheesh, well that ends that then. Good to know, thanks for telling me.
21:30:51 <marshall10> still writing system.... on the  web installer window
21:31:06 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: yeah, this can take a while, depending on how fast your computer's USB is.
21:31:32 <marshall10> unpacking vendor...
21:32:09 <TheJollyRoger> It's got to decompress all that data containing the system images, then send it to your phone, which then writes it to the onboard storage. Given that it's a 3a, this may actually be a tad bit slower than the other comparable devices, since the 3a uses an older, slower chip and storage.
21:32:40 <marshall10> it is fastboot mode now
21:32:58 <marshall10> Flashed sargo-factory-2021.03.06.00.zip to device.
21:33:08 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
21:33:20 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, you're on the home stretch. Scroll down a bit and click "Lock bootloader"
21:33:48 <TheJollyRoger> It will show you the menu on the phone, this time you will do the reverse and lock the bootloader.
21:33:55 <TheJollyRoger> *the reverse of what you did earlier and lock the bootloader.
21:33:56 <marshall10> bootloader locked
21:34:00 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
21:34:16 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. So... last couple of steps. Unplug your phone.
21:34:20 <marshall10> phone is off now
21:34:25 <marshall10> ok
21:34:34 <marshall10> unpluged
21:34:53 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to start the phone. If it boots, great, we move onto the next step, if not, we go back and start over.
21:35:13 <TheJollyRoger> Switch your phone on. It should give you a yellow screen "Your device is loading a different operating system" caution.
21:35:22 <TheJollyRoger> If it does, you're in good shape.
21:35:34 <marshall10> starting grapheneos
21:36:11 <TheJollyRoger> If it all worked, you'll be introduced to the GrapheneOS setup launcher, which will allow you to set up your preferences, enter your wifi password, etc.
21:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> If you want you can insert your SIM card now. If you already have your SIM card in place, you're good to go with the mobile network.
21:37:31 <marshall10> thank you guys... ill try to do it now on my own....if i have any questions - i can contact you here gain ?
21:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> We're not done yet!
21:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: we still have one more step to go.
21:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> (plus an optional one)
21:37:53 <TheJollyRoger> But you are on the home stretch.
21:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to go back to Settings -> About Phone -> Build Number and tap on "Build Number" ten times until it reports "You are a developer!"
21:39:12 <TheJollyRoger> Once you do that, I want you to go back to Developer Options. You will see "OEM Unlocking" is in the place we left it, switched on. I want you to slide the "OEM Unlocking" toggle to off.
21:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> Then I want you to look at the top, where it says "Developer Options On" in the blue banner. Slide that to "Off"
21:40:03 <TheJollyRoger> Once you toggle OEM unlocking, you'll be asked to restart the phone to take effect.
21:40:43 <TheJollyRoger> This is an important step - this ensures that if someone wants to unlock the bootloader again, they'll have to either know your password, or to get your phone to recovery and issue a factory reset from recovery in order to get at that switch a second time.
21:41:18 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: once you've done that, installation is complete and you can pair with Attestation Server if you want to verify your keys.
21:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> marshall10: welcome aboard, shipmate.
21:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> Aw darn, right before I could give him the "this ship is kept sailing by donations" speech.
21:42:40 <TheJollyRoger> D'oh.
21:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ah well.
21:48:36 <strcat[m]> going to be making some bans based on people participating in bullying, harassing and spreading dishonest claims about this community and the developers in other channels
21:48:45 <strcat[m]>  * going to be making some bans based on people participating in bullying, harassment and spreading dishonest claims about this community and the developers in other channels
21:49:31 <strcat[m]> nothing major
21:49:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Linus has joined the Telegram Group!
21:49:47 <strcat[m]> but if you're wondering why it's from behavior outside the channel
21:50:10 <pkgbuild[m]> strcat: thank you like always, was the cable just changed pc and the OS was applied
22:01:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Why is the graphene dialer app so 2012 looking?
22:02:13 <strcat> not sure what you mean
22:02:18 <pkgbuild[m]> *or the android tools inside arch I wasn’t able to update it to 31
22:02:26 <strcat> it's material design and looks pretty similar to the 2021 version of the Google Dialer app
22:02:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> It feels like the stock phone app that came with android 1.0
22:02:54 <strcat> pretty sure Android 1.0 didn't use the Material design style
22:03:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Maybe, but it looks pretty darn ancient
22:03:32 <strcat> it's the AOSP Dialer app with very minor changes like setting up visual voicemail configuration
22:03:36 <strcat> it's not an ancient UI at all
22:03:45 <strcat> it looks pretty much like Google Dialer does today anyway
22:04:23 <strcat> of all topics to concern troll about this is a particularly odd one
22:05:34 <stubbornant[m]> Hi, I am waiting for an answer from Wire staff and while I was waiting I have seen that in the notification settings of the app, there is one category deleted. That's the background notification service that actually is visible in my lineage phone. Is there something I can do to fix it?
22:07:03 <stubbornant[m]> It's been driving me crazy all day 😂
22:08:32 <strcat> stubbornant[m]: that implies the app deleted it, did you toggle it off in the app?
22:08:46 <strcat> stubbornant[m]: did you silence the notification?
22:09:03 <strcat> stubbornant[m]: I suggest just clearing app data and starting over, without doing whatever you did again, if that's the problem
22:09:37 <stubbornant[m]> I just cleared all of the notification settings out of desperacy
22:09:51 <stubbornant[m]> And all of the data and cache of the app
22:10:00 <stubbornant[m]> It did not work
22:10:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Voices opinion about phone app, called troll.
22:10:30 <stubbornant[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Linus> Voices opinion about ph"> You can download simple dialer on f droid as an alternative
22:10:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Also, for some reason dark mode doesn't work in the phone app
22:10:50 <stubbornant[m]> I cannot say about security but it looks ok
22:11:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Linus> Thanks, I'll look into it
22:11:51 <stubbornant[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Linus> Also, for some reason d"> Yes that is why I told you about that app. I have to use dark mode. For me all that light is a punch in the eye 🙂
22:13:12 <stubbornant[m]> I do not mean to be rude but this OS seems to be so bad ass that we should thank the work that has been put in it
22:13:30 <stubbornant[m]> Actually is it possible to donate XMR to the project?
22:14:36 <stubbornant[m]> https://grapheneos.org/donate

23:42:01 <TheJollyRoger> @!Linus - there's a fiat to this; apps within the same profile can, if both their respective authors have whitelisted their respective apps specifically do inter-process communication.
23:42:44 <Marcelo> hola
23:42:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
23:44:02 <Marcelo> sorry
23:44:06 <TheJollyRoger> So if two apps have been installed into the same profile that have been specifically written to work together to exfiltrate data and their publishers both conspire to do so with the full co-operation of each other, one could in theory pass information to the other, which then could exfiltrate it. Interprocess communication is a *feature*.
23:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> This is how some apps, like K-9 Mail/FairEmail and OpenKeyChain work in tandem - OpenKeyChain encrypts and decrypts outgoing and incoming messages, while the mail client sends and receives them.
23:45:53 <TheJollyRoger> In that case, it's used for good. But it can be used for evil, so bear that in mind with the Network permission toggle: it's not there to increase the trustworthiness of an app that would otherwise be untrustworthy.
23:45:58 <TheJollyRoger> Marcelo: for what?
23:51:39 <guest12345467576> hey whats up guys I have graphene OS installed on a pixel 3a
23:52:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy guest12345467576, yarr, glad to hear!
23:52:14 <guest12345467576> I am having trouble getting the phone number verified via the signal app; which is already installed.
23:52:27 <guest12345467576> any ideas how to verify my phone number?
23:52:39 <Marcelo> noting
23:52:49 <TheJollyRoger> Marcelo: no need to apologize, welcome to the channel.
23:53:52 <TheJollyRoger> guest12345467576: Occasionally, if Signal's servers are congested, from time to time the activation SMS codes don't send. If that's the case, simply try again, assuming you have tested and can receive SMS messages on your phone.
23:54:02 <akc3n[m]> <guest12345467576 "any ideas how to verify my phone"> Have you tried tapping the option for signal to call you with verification code (after the timer runs out  when they text you)
23:54:05 <TheJollyRoger> It's best to give it a couple minutes inbetween before you do, just in case.
23:54:34 <TheJollyRoger> akc3n[m] good idea!
23:55:25 <akc3n[m]> guest12345467576: are you using a sim or a virtual number?
23:55:42 <kiwisine> yeah, see if signal can contact you, gues 1234567576
23:56:07 <guest12345467576> I am using a sim
23:56:16 <guest12345467576> I am using a sim
23:56:37 <akc3n[m]> <TheJollyRoger "akc3n good idea!"> Thanks, I remember a while back using an app called textnow, the SMS verification from signal would not work, hence tapping the call with verification code worked.
23:57:15 <guest12345467576> ty it appears my SMS is not working only MMS
23:57:19 <guest12345467576> that could be the issue
23:57:34 <akc3n[m]> <guest12345467576 "I am using a sim"> Okay, are you able to send and receive SMS messages from regular contacts?
23:58:21 <guest12345467576> I don't believe so
23:58:41 <guest12345467576> only MMS
23:59:23 <akc3n[m]> Honestly, I would select the option to receive verification code via call not SMS.
23:59:23 <akc3n[m]> And are you using the default aosp messaging app included with with grapheneos?
23:59:56 <guest12345467576> yes I have been using the default msging app
