01:30:45 <AppAraat[m]> stencil: Seems like I have to get a flash drive for SeedVault backups or install NextCloud and so I can't use my laptop storage for that. I can also backup to internal storage, but where would that be located at? Would I be able to see it in my file managers?

01:52:15 <stencil[m]> Not sure if a dot is all it takes to be safe from apps scanning file system
01:58:27 <Ramp23> Will be replacing my pixel 3a next year. what new pixel phones can we expect
02:00:11 <stencil[m]> Pixel 5
02:00:12 <stencil[m]> Then 5a
02:00:35 <stencil[m]> Who needs leaks we already know
02:02:17 <zed19[m]> can i use any pixel for graphene os?
02:07:19 <johngaltsbrother> will this os using pixel be usable internationally?

02:46:03 <AppAraat[m]> wtf - https://nitter.net/DanielMicay/status/1145266737883033600#m - I had absolutely no idea this was possible.
02:46:56 <enxio27> Is Win10 an absolute requirement to install GrapheneOS, or can Win7 be used instead?
02:56:06 <deappledapple> <enxio27 "Is Win10 an absolute requirement"> https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
02:56:34 <deappledapple> Windows 10 is officially supported for flashing GrapheneOS on a supported Pixel
02:56:35 <affablevegetable> win 7 would probably work
02:56:49 <affablevegetable> if not just boot ubuntu 20 on a livecd usb drive and youre good to go
02:57:29 <tut090> Hello. Anyone know if the 4a will work on the 4a 5g version?
02:57:40 <deappledapple> <tut090 "Hello. Anyone know if the 4a wil"> No
02:57:42 <affablevegetable> no it does not
02:57:47 <deappledapple> <tut090 "Hello. Anyone know if the 4a wil"> It will brick your phone
02:58:05 <deappledapple> If you flashed 4a images on 4a 5g
02:58:08 <tut090> ok. Figured as much. Just thought I'd check.
02:58:13 <bentley> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices "The Pixel 4a 5G is poorly named and isn't really a variant of the Pixel 4a. It shares more in common with the Pixel 5 and our existing Pixel 4a support isn't relevant to it.

02:58:27 <deappledapple> <affablevegetable "win 7 would probably work"> ...in practice, windows 7 may work depending on the drivers installed, and the availability of Powershell
02:59:00 <Ramp23> 5a expected relwase date ?? Sometime next year ?
02:59:39 <enxio27> What drivers should I look for?  I'll have to check on the Powershell.  I don't recall now whether I've ever tried to use it on this box, but I may have.
03:01:12 <Ramp23> Don't wana be that guy but there are plenty of video's on YouTube that will have you up and running in 20 min
03:01:41 <AppAraat[m]> uh, upon fresh install of GrapheneOS I turned night light on and now screen has gone dark :S
03:02:31 <affablevegetable> any source for cheap 4a?
03:02:31 <AppAraat[m]> guess I'll just reboot lol
03:02:38 <tut090> knew i'd regret getting the 4a 5g version over the regular 4a. hoping they have a release for the 5g version soon;
03:03:37 <affablevegetable> serious question does anyone sell non KYC google pixel 4a?
03:08:37 <deappledapple> What's KYC?
03:08:57 <squarmkt[m]> Know your customer
03:10:04 <squarmkt[m]> Used to verify who someone is, can go to a store to get one
03:10:56 <deappledapple> <affablevegetable "serious question does anyone sel"> Have you tried in Google store, if available in your country?
03:12:06 <affablevegetable> pretty sure that required KYC
03:14:42 <Ramp23> Your looking a burner pixel ?
03:15:08 <affablevegetable> just wondering if there is a source to buy them
03:15:50 <stencil[m]> <AppAraat[m] "uh, upon fresh install of Graphe"> means you should sleep
03:16:04 <Ramp23> Ebay I doubt the sellers on there are keeping phone imei and stuff
03:16:23 <Ramp23> Maybe some amazin sellers as well
03:16:29 <Ramp23> Amazon***
03:17:00 <stencil[m]> pretty sure amazon doesn't have, but you know amazon
03:17:24 <AppAraat[m]> stencil: wow, truly a next-get phone this 3a then :p
03:17:35 <Ramp23> Can you not get pay as you go ?
03:18:42 <stencil[m]> I think we lost track
03:18:50 <Ramp23> Lol
03:19:32 <take_a_deep_brea> affablevegetable: wherever you buy it from just make sure bootloader is unlockable.
03:19:53 <affablevegetable> does anyone sell preloaded phones with graphene
03:20:05 <Ramp23> Trust issue
03:20:51 <Ramp23> Its really not that hard lol
03:21:30 <affablevegetable> no its not hard but you cant get mass adoption
03:22:19 <Ramp23> You don't want mass adoption. More people use an OS bigger target it is.
03:22:42 <affablevegetable> security by obscurity isn't real
03:22:45 <Ramp23> Just the right amount of people to make it work well
03:23:03 <Ramp23> Open source google code hardly obscure
03:23:34 <affablevegetable> i was referring to the principle of being less of a target because its obscure right now
03:23:43 <affablevegetable> I do agree though most things go sour
03:23:46 <affablevegetable> but signal is a success case
03:24:02 <Ramp23> Yes
03:25:35 <stencil[m]> The best would be if we could do it ourself, but that's cost prohibitive
03:26:21 <stencil[m]> Anyway getting off track, use #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  for off topic
03:26:54 <louipcm> affablevegetable:  there are a few companies that sell phones with grapheneos. none are officially endorsed at the moment
03:27:26 <louipcm> ncrypt cellular out of australia is often mentioned though since they contribute back the the project
03:27:58 <affablevegetable> thank you for the info
03:34:04 <AppAraat[m]> stencil: I think I'll listen to my new Pixel 3a. Good night.
03:35:22 <stencil[m]> good morning
04:30:18 <mishmasher[m]> Hi I have another question. I have this app. That you give admin access too and it can monitor your unlock attempts and if the set number of attempts have been done. It erases all data on your phone. Factory reset. If I set that app on another profile then owner would it just delete the profile or would it factory reset the whole phone  including the owner profile?
04:35:21 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "Hi I have another question. I ha"> A device admin app has more control over that profile than the user themself
04:39:08 <mishmasher[m]> Shiii that's some good info thank you!

07:17:21 <Tifriis[m]> <asht "Hey, do you know how and whether"> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider/discussions/17
07:21:54 <BraveBeginner> Hi friends. I'm using linux terminal to install GrapheneOS on a pixel phone. I got to the step where I enter the command "./flash-all.sh", but now terminal is just blinking. I'm a little new to linux too. Any advice?
07:31:50 <deappledapple> Wdym by blinking
07:32:01 <deappledapple> No output or whatever, like < waiting for device > ?
07:33:01 <BraveBeginner> Exactly
07:35:38 <BraveBeginner> It didn't show me any output at first. When I stopped the command with Ctrl+Z and entered the same "./flash-all.sh" it didn't show any output either, but then it told me < waiting for device >
07:41:31 <BraveBeginner> I just tried "sudo ./flash-all.sh" and it says "fastboot not found"
07:46:11 <take_a_deep_brea> BraveBeginner: that means the fastboot is not in your PATH variable
07:46:31 <take_a_deep_brea> btw which distribution are you using ?
07:46:38 <BraveBeginner> Elementary OS
07:47:14 <take_a_deep_brea> BraveBeginner: only arch linux , debian and ubuntu are supported
07:47:43 <BraveBeginner> I see. I might have to try again with windows then.
07:48:15 <ahmouse> hello
07:48:21 <jalb> Hello, can anyone confirm if this breaks the Titan M security?: https://ninjalab.io/a-side-journey-to-titan/
07:48:31 <BraveBeginner> Will it be ok if I just shut the phone off? Will it start at fastboot mode?
07:48:34 <take_a_deep_brea> BraveBeginner: yeah sure , windows is better but do make sure it has been updates
07:49:25 <take_a_deep_brea> <jalb "Hello, can anyone confirm if thi"> titan secure keys are not closely related to titan m chip
07:49:43 <take_a_deep_brea> <BraveBeginner "Will it be ok if I just shut the"> its ok
07:49:51 <BraveBeginner> Thank you so much
07:49:51 <jalb> take_a_deep_brea, great!, can you please explain the difference?
07:50:00 <take_a_deep_brea> <BraveBeginner "Thank you so much"> but try it on window
07:50:03 <jalb> I was worried when I read it
07:50:03 <take_a_deep_brea> welcome
07:50:11 <ahmouse> im no security expert, but wouldnt it make sense for only the keyboard app to have access to the clipboard?
07:50:13 <BraveBeginner> Will do
07:50:50 <ahmouse> pasting can simply be emulated to the app as regular typing
07:51:54 <take_a_deep_brea> jalb:  i am no expert. but the titan security key is a hardware key that can be used for two gactor authentication
07:52:29 <strcat[m]> ahmouse: check issue tracker and docs 1st
07:52:38 <strcat[m]> ahmouse: you're welcome to work on planned features on the tracker
07:52:40 <jalb> take_a_deep_brea, ok thanks
07:52:56 <strcat[m]> bringing up things already filed there doesn't help, the reason things aren't implemented isn't lack of ideas but lack of work
07:53:54 <ahmouse> oh well i didnt even check the issue tracker honestly
07:54:38 <ahmouse> i see though, and perhaps ill contribute to graphene in the future
07:55:17 <heri[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "jalb:  i am no expert. but the t"> Titan M is explicitly hardened against such side-channel attacks as the one linked
07:55:54 <jalb> heri[m], thanks!
07:56:33 <ahmouse> has anyone attempt to build graphene on the oneplus 6t?
07:58:49 <ahmouse> or has any more info on adding support for other devices in general
07:59:17 <take_a_deep_brea> ahmouse: please go through https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
07:59:18 <Ramp23> So the article on titan m is lies ?
08:00:01 <somenerd[m]> > or has any more info on adding support for other devices in general
08:00:01 <somenerd[m]> I believe oneplus had broken verified boot
08:00:17 <somenerd[m]> > So the article on titan m is lies ?
08:00:17 <somenerd[m]> > titan secure keys are not closely related to titan m chip
08:00:30 <somenerd[m]> not sure tbh
08:00:49 <somenerd[m]> take_a_deep_breath said that the article wasn't about Titan M
08:00:57 <Ramp23> But the key the chip for phone and server chips are all related ??
08:01:08 <Ramp23> For the chip***
08:02:20 <somenerd[m]> I think that the Titan Security Key is a 2FA key
08:02:28 <somenerd[m]> https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key/
08:03:08 <ahmouse> thats unfortunate honestly, since the pixel 3 and 4 seem to only have better cameras relative to the pixel 2. If they had higher specs i would love to get one of them just to use graphene
08:03:13 <take_a_deep_brea> its not a lie. and has got nothing to do with the Titan M housed in a pixel
08:03:18 <Ramp23> Ahh right
08:03:30 <jalb> Ohhh!! https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key
08:03:36 <somenerd[m]> yeah
08:03:37 <jalb> So it's another product! Thanks a lot
08:03:43 <take_a_deep_brea> and this is getting kinda off topic folks
08:03:49 <somenerd[m]> it sure is
08:04:17 <jalb> Yes, sorry. I was confused by Titan
08:04:18 <take_a_deep_brea> so please move this  to off topic room
08:04:24 <somenerd[m]> > thats unfortunate honestly, since the pixel 3 and 4 seem to only have better cameras relative to the pixel 2. If they had higher specs i would love to get one of them just to use graphene
08:04:24 <somenerd[m]> sadly no other phone has good security or good support for alternative OSs
08:05:24 <somenerd[m]> (afaik)
08:06:00 <ahmouse> in terms of alternative os i think oneplus is pretty good about that
08:06:06 <ahmouse> not sure on their security though
08:07:46 <take_a_deep_brea> one plus does not have a proper verified boot if i recall rigjt from what someone said here a while aho
08:07:56 <take_a_deep_brea> *ago
08:08:14 <strcat[m]> Titan Security Key uses an NXP secure element
08:08:28 <ahmouse> ah ok, i thought that was only for the 6t
08:08:29 <strcat[m]> that issue is with an NXP secure element used in a bunch of security keys
08:08:33 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with the Titan M
08:08:58 <strcat[m]> and I think people totally misunderstand the purpose of it
08:09:00 <strcat[m]> and how it's integrated
08:09:06 <strcat[m]> if they are concerned about something like that
08:19:43 <take_a_deep_brea> well theyve even given a list of products affected.  and are very clear about the likelihood of such an attack taking place.
08:23:54 <ahmouse> is there anymore information about oneplus having broken verified boot? The latest info I could find is in regard to the Oneplus 2
08:24:15 <ahmouse> or possibly even a way to test it for myself
10:03:26 <clox[m]> Signal is decrypted
10:07:19 <stencil[m]> Off topic go to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
10:09:58 <strcat[m]> why does it matter when it hasn't gotten security updates for ages?
11:18:53 <silentresearch[m> Hi there, any android devs online? :D
11:22:05 <stencil[m]> <stencil[m] "Off topic go to #grapheneos-offt"> .
11:22:26 <stencil[m]> <silentresearch[m "Hi there, any android devs onlin"> Probably some in OT room
11:22:47 <silentresearch[m> well technically I want to add a feature @grapheneOS so might be on-topic ;)
11:28:02 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: people are online
11:28:05 <strcat[m]> should ask the actual question
11:28:12 <strcat[m]> instead of asking questions about asking it
11:28:51 <silentresearch[m> I want to increase the level of security of my device running grapheneOS with implementing an auth method that requires a series of fingerprints in a specific order.
11:28:51 <silentresearch[m> For example: pointer finer, middle finger, little finger
11:28:51 <silentresearch[m> To make this work I would need to be able to get an identifier for a specific print in the response from the biometric auth
11:29:22 <silentresearch[m> does that work with the biometric auth api today?
11:31:13 <strcat[m]> doubt it
11:31:23 <strcat[m]> don't want that kind of feature ourselves
11:31:38 <strcat[m]> suggest working on something we do want
11:32:36 <silentresearch[m> why not?
11:32:58 <silentresearch[m> and why should I care about what YOU want :D
11:32:59 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28
11:33:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> actually this is implemented by other roms
11:33:53 <Golli[m]1> <strcat[m] "https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os"> Would this include face unlock too?
11:33:56 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: it's overcomplicated and won't have a good UI
11:34:00 <strcat[m]> Golli: it can
11:34:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> might be able to take only what we want for our impl
11:34:15 <silentresearch[m> @strcat:matrix.org: it's also increasing the security
11:34:22 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: we don't want it
11:34:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: no
11:34:28 <silentresearch[m> who is we
11:34:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> lockdown toggle exists
11:34:36 <strcat[m]> work on https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 if you want to work on something we want
11:34:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> <silentresearch[m "who is we"> grapheneos
11:35:37 <silentresearch[m> why wouldn't you want a feature that increases the level of security drastically - especially if there is users that would like to have a feature like that?
11:35:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: lockdown button exists
11:36:06 <silentresearch[m> scanning 3 fingers is a lot faster than typing a damn passphrase
11:36:18 <silentresearch[m> and you can hardly bruteforce that :D
11:36:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: this has been discussed before
11:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> or maybe not
11:36:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> use a secondary profile
11:37:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> nvm i'm just out of here
11:37:09 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just work on the kernel stuff
11:37:09 <silentresearch[m> I doubt it... I had a hard time finding any info for using a series of fprints for auth
11:37:17 <rny> silentresearch[m: fork it and build your own
11:37:38 <louipcm> silentresearch:  well there's nothing wrong with you to work on novel auth methods on your own
11:37:38 <Golli[m]1> <anupritaisno1[m] "silentresearch: lockdown button "> Something nice with this would be if you press the power button with the lockdown screen open, it automatically enters lockdown.
11:37:45 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: we don't want it - we don't want a focus on biometric auth
11:37:47 <louipcm> silentresearch:  actually i seen some suggestions of using multiple pattern unlocks to try to make them more secure
11:37:55 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: work on https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28
11:37:59 <louipcm> so you could make that part of your fork too and serve multiple interests
11:38:09 <silentresearch[m> I don't want that @strcat ;)
11:38:10 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: what you're proposing is just an overly complex, worse alternative to https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28
11:38:30 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: ok, well, if you want work on it the way the project wants
11:38:40 <strcat[m]> you can't contribute
11:38:54 <rny> an unlocking method that requires (1) juggling your phone for 10 secs, followed by (2) fingerprint
11:38:55 <strcat[m]> so go do your own thing - it's not something we want
11:39:02 <rny> :upside_down smiley face:
11:39:12 <louipcm> #28 looks nice too :D why not do both
11:39:16 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 is already filed about implementing support for 2 factor unlock
11:39:21 <strcat[m]> biometric + knowledge-based
11:39:32 <rny> juggling is easier than putting in password /
11:39:33 <rny> juggling is easier than putting in password /s
11:39:41 <silentresearch[m> I read #28
11:39:43 <louipcm> rny:  pass, pin, pattern, 10 fingers, and face unlock
11:39:46 <strcat[m]> a PIN is a much more complex knowledge-based authentication method than order of fingers
11:39:53 <strcat[m]> and also
11:40:00 <rny> louipcm: add do a silly face too
11:40:16 <strcat[m]>  * a PIN is a much more high entropy knowledge-based authentication method than order of fingers
11:40:23 <louipcm> hehe
11:40:32 <silentresearch[m> you mean a mirror app?
11:40:49 <strcat[m]> the purpose of a biometric authentication method is it's something you are
11:41:00 <rny> what about a pattern of facial expressions? smile, frown, smile, angry, grin, etc etc..
11:41:07 <louipcm> im not a good juggler
11:41:32 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: you want to add a knowledge-based factor (order of fingers)
11:41:36 <rny> i'll stop with my sarcasm now.
11:41:40 <strcat[m]> a PIN is also a knowledge-based factor, but much higher entropy
11:42:05 <strcat[m]> and the UX is better
11:42:13 <strcat[m]> fingerprint reading can fail
11:42:18 <strcat[m]> and it has to learn each finger
11:42:24 <strcat[m]> and the existing way it works
11:42:26 <silentresearch[m> a pin can be entered automatically
11:42:30 <strcat[m]> is you can register any number and use any
11:42:37 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: don't know what you mean by that
11:42:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> what is fingerprint exactly
11:42:44 <silentresearch[m> it's a lot harder to chop off someones fingers and bruteforce with them
11:42:52 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: no
11:42:55 <strcat[m]> read the docs
11:42:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> still at interest area detection or is thewre somethinmg better now?
11:43:00 <strcat[m]> there is a rate limit on unlocking
11:43:04 <anupritaisno1[m]>  * still at interest area detection or is there something better now?
11:43:09 <strcat[m]> look
11:43:15 <strcat[m]> a PIN is much higher entropy and is simpler
11:43:15 <silentresearch[m> those rate limits have been bypassed before
11:43:16 <strcat[m]> the UX is much better
11:43:23 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: no they haven't
11:43:25 <silentresearch[m> they will be bypassed again
11:43:25 <strcat[m]> read the docs
11:43:28 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: no
11:43:31 <strcat[m]> they haven't
11:43:33 <strcat[m]> read the docs
11:43:38 <silentresearch[m> not for this OS
11:43:39 <silentresearch[m> YET
11:43:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: u what
11:43:57 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: if the OS is exploited
11:44:08 <strcat[m]> your fingerprint thing does nothing to protect against something more
11:44:10 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make any sense
11:44:12 <strcat[m]> and don't spread FUD
11:44:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: please read our rules
11:44:39 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: if you aren't interested in doing it the way the project wants, you aren't interested in contributing to the project
11:44:41 <rny> always something interesting.
11:44:52 <silentresearch[m> the iPhone pin was hacked with resetting the counter
11:44:54 <strcat[m]> any non-trivial PR is likely to require multiple rounds of changes based on review
11:45:11 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: not relevant - what you're talking about does nothing to protect against the OS being compromised
11:45:35 <silentresearch[m> @strcat
11:45:38 <gofigga[m]> There is also the issue of US courts forcing people to use fingerprint authentication to unlock their devices, whereas people who are using passwords/pins do not have to give that information to authorities
11:45:43 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: bringing up non-sequitur claims that aren't relevant isn't an argument against the way we want to do it
11:45:55 <silentresearch[m> you said PIN was secure
11:46:14 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: stop spreading FUD
11:46:18 <strcat[m]> stop making pointless non-sequitur claims
11:46:18 <silentresearch[m> I replied with an example where PIN auth was hacked bypassing the exact security feature you brought up as why it is safe
11:46:24 <strcat[m]> no
11:46:27 <silentresearch[m> yes
11:46:30 <strcat[m]> you're just bullshitting now
11:46:36 <silentresearch[m> I'm not
11:46:39 <strcat[m]> you are
11:46:56 <strcat[m]> what you're proposing has no defense against what you're bringing up (compromising the OS and secure element)
11:47:05 <parakeetos[m]> <silentresearch[m "I replied with an example where "> What do you research? Biology in first grade?
11:47:10 <parakeetos[m]> Bs
11:47:14 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: you're saying
11:47:18 <strcat[m]> they have compromised the OS fully
11:47:27 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: so... any code you write can be altered/replaced
11:47:30 <silentresearch[m> https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37407047
11:47:36 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: they can try orders programmatically
11:47:38 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: again
11:47:40 <strcat[m]> non sequitur
11:47:43 <strcat[m]> stop
11:48:05 <strcat[m]> you're saying an attacker exploits the OS (and secure element) to bypass limits
11:48:12 <strcat[m]> what you're proposing does nothing to address that
11:48:23 <strcat[m]> so they have each finger scanned once... and they iterate through the orders
11:48:32 <strcat[m]> what's the relevance of it to what you're talking about?
11:48:35 <silentresearch[m> I didn't say that
11:48:38 <strcat[m]> and there is no hardware enforcement of your finger
11:48:39 <strcat[m]> yes
11:48:40 <strcat[m]> you did
11:48:43 <strcat[m]> it is exactly what you said
11:49:03 <strcat[m]> you brought up an issue (attacker exploiting OS to automatically attempt unlocking)
11:49:10 <strcat[m]> that issue applies to your proposal just as much
11:49:17 <strcat[m]> so it isn't relevant
11:49:34 <silentresearch[m> it might be what you understood but it's surely not what I said
11:49:41 <strcat[m]> if you aren't willing to work on it the way we want, we don't want it, this proposal conflicts with the way that biometric auth is implemented
11:49:49 <strcat[m]> and it also has a bad UX
11:49:54 <strcat[m]> it's too complicated, the UX will be bad
11:50:03 <strcat[m]> each phase of it can fail and require redoing it
11:50:09 <strcat[m]> it's overcomplicated for too little entropy
11:50:23 <strcat[m]> also the way that fingerprint auth works is you can register multiple and use any
11:50:29 <silentresearch[m> you're entitled to have your own opinion - I didn't make a feature request
11:50:35 <strcat[m]> it's just way too complicated and conflicts with the existing way of doing it
11:50:44 <strcat[m]> a PIN is higher entropy
11:50:53 <silentresearch[m> I asked if some android-dev is online that can provide the result of the biometric.authSuccess object
11:50:57 <strcat[m]> combining a PIN with a biometric authentication method (any method that's supported)
11:51:17 <strcat[m]> has similar combination of what you are + what you know
11:51:28 <strcat[m]> but with a higher entropy knowledge-based factor
11:51:32 <strcat[m]> no conflict with how biometric unlocking works
11:51:38 <strcat[m]> not specific to fingerprints
11:51:49 <strcat[m]> and it's already planned out and filed in our tracker
11:52:06 <silentresearch[m> it also takes a lot more time if you want to use a proper PIN
11:52:06 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: and you specifically brought up implementing it for GrapheneOS to make it on-topic for the channel
11:52:36 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: a 4 digit PIN is better than some 6 finger order from 1 hand
11:52:44 <somenerd[m]> > it also takes a lot more time if you want to use a proper PIN
11:52:44 <somenerd[m]> which is why there is a 2FA request?
11:53:00 <strcat[m]> we aren't talking about this out of context
11:53:07 <strcat[m]> we're talking about it in comparison to each other
11:53:15 <strcat[m]> PIN vs. order of fingers
11:53:20 <strcat[m]> PIN + fingerprint vs. multiple fingerprints in a specific order
11:53:29 <silentresearch[m> how fast can you swipe 3 fingers on a sensor and how fast can you type in a 16 digit pin?
11:53:35 <strcat[m]> PIN + fingerprint is a nicer, simpler UX which fits with how it already works
11:53:43 <silentresearch[m> fuck nice and simple
11:53:45 <silentresearch[m> I want secure
11:53:48 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: swiping 3 fingers so... you're comparing to a 1-2 digit PIN
11:54:06 <strcat[m]> the fact that they are fingerprints does not make them higher entropy
11:54:09 <strcat[m]> if you're using 4 fingers on 1 hand
11:54:13 <strcat[m]> that's 4 possible choices per scan
11:54:15 <somenerd[m]> > I want secure
11:54:15 <somenerd[m]> it isn't?
11:54:18 <silentresearch[m> I have 10 fingers on 2 hands
11:54:21 <strcat[m]> a PIN is 10 choices per digit
11:54:23 <strcat[m]> ok
11:54:24 <take_a_deep_brea> <silentresearch[m "fuck nice and simple"> you want secure go for 20 letter random passphrase
11:54:27 <strcat[m]> so you're making the UX even worse now
11:54:35 <strcat[m]> and fine - 10 fingers on both hands, you're actually going to be swapping phone
11:54:36 <strcat[m]> between hands
11:54:40 <strcat[m]> and scanning your thumbs too
11:54:57 <silentresearch[m> secure + convenient - a series of x fprints in order y
11:55:05 <somenerd[m]> how is it secure?
11:55:14 <somenerd[m]> even if you use all 10 fingers
11:55:21 <somenerd[m]> 10! number of combinations
11:55:28 <somenerd[m]> 3.6 million
11:55:39 <somenerd[m]> and that's like an 8 digit pin?
11:55:46 <take_a_deep_brea> it involves a lot of overt action that can be caught   in some angles even casually
11:55:46 <silentresearch[m> I can then add a PIN on top of it and I'll be more secure than you with your pointer finger and a 2 digit pin
11:55:57 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: a number-only PIN has 10 digits per number, if you're actually using all 10 fingers then sure that has 10 choices too
11:56:01 <strcat[m]> using fingerprints
11:56:06 <strcat[m]> is again not inherently any higher entropy
11:56:17 <parakeetos[m]> <silentresearch[m "I want secure"> Then why insisting with a less secure system than we actually have?
11:56:22 <strcat[m]> there is no additional entropy from orders of fingers vs. the numbers
11:56:41 <silentresearch[m> a series of fprints + passphrase is more secure than what you have now
11:56:55 <take_a_deep_brea> yep finger-> a digit 0-9
11:56:56 <silentresearch[m> compare fprints to series of fprints please
11:57:00 <strcat[m]> we don't want the series of fingerprints
11:57:01 <silentresearch[m> I didn't say that I don't want to put a device unlock passphrase on top
11:57:03 <strcat[m]> we've explained why
11:57:08 <strcat[m]> we don't want the feature
11:57:18 <strcat[m]> using 1 fingerprint + knowledge factor
11:57:19 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS is for user-friendly security
11:57:21 <strcat[m]> is a lot simpler and higher entropy
11:57:32 <somenerd[m]> ok?
11:57:35 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: has been explained already
11:57:35 <somenerd[m]> not some sort of complicated mess
11:57:42 <somenerd[m]> called "secure"
11:57:50 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: for some reason you're treating a series of fingerprints as higher entropy choices when it's not
11:58:14 <strcat[m]> pretend someone actually uses a series of fingerprints choosing randomly from all 10 fingers - fine
11:58:22 <strcat[m]> so there are 10 choices - same as choosing a number from the number pad
11:58:40 <strcat[m]> if you're there, you hopefully have all 10 fingers
11:58:48 <take_a_deep_brea> silentresearch a finger has only enough entropy to cover a digit on the context of your hand
11:58:49 <strcat[m]> using a fingerprint == adding something you are
11:58:52 <strcat[m]> as a factor
11:59:00 <strcat[m]> using multiple fingerprints is not adding more of that
11:59:06 <strcat[m]> if you're there, you have 10 fingers available
11:59:09 <silentresearch[m> I repeat: compare 1 fprint to a series of fprints
11:59:11 <strcat[m]> if you're not, they're not
11:59:16 <silentresearch[m> not a series of fprints to a passphrase
11:59:18 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: that's not relevant
11:59:31 <strcat[m]> we design features based on the available options
11:59:38 <strcat[m]> the comparison is this:
11:59:46 <strcat[m]> PIN + fingerprint vs. series of fingerprints
12:00:11 <parakeetos[m]> If you need that level of security i think your least problem would be doing that system by yourself
12:00:12 <strcat[m]> either way is what you are (fingerprint confirms that) + what you know (PIN vs. order)
12:00:12 <silentresearch[m> no
12:00:26 <silentresearch[m> the comparison is PIN +fprint vs PIN + series of fprints
12:00:41 <strcat[m]> no that's just overcomplicating it massively
12:00:44 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make any sense
12:00:55 <silentresearch[m> sorry but is everything ok with you?
12:01:03 <strcat[m]> I don't think you'll be able to contribute to the project even if you find an issue you want to work on
12:01:08 <silentresearch[m> you say the comparison is pin vs s of fprints
12:01:11 <silentresearch[m> I say no it's not
12:01:17 <silentresearch[m> I came up with it so I know what I want
12:01:18 <strcat[m]> that's not what I said
12:01:24 <strcat[m]> ok, and we don't want it
12:01:40 <silentresearch[m> I love talking to open source devs
12:01:45 <silentresearch[m> arrogant and stubborn
12:01:54 <silentresearch[m> but it's a free workd
12:01:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> man i am like
12:02:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> what the fuck
12:02:06 <strcat[m]> we have an issue filed in our tracker for 2 factor authentication (what you are + what you know)
12:02:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> did you hire us for contract work or something lol
12:02:17 <strcat[m]> it's simple, it works with arbitrary biometrics in theory (face unlock, etc.)
12:02:28 <rny> how is it arrogant and stuborn when a discussion took place?
12:02:30 <strcat[m]> it fits with how the existing biometric unlock works (where you can register multiple options and use any)
12:02:33 <silentresearch[m> yes and that issue would even be better if it wouldn't require a fprint but a series of fprints
12:02:36 <rny> nobody told you to fuck off
12:02:44 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: not better than just adding more digits
12:02:46 <strcat[m]> to your PIN
12:02:52 <parakeetos[m]> <silentresearch[m "arrogant and stubborn"> The problem is yout arrogance makes you think you actually thinked *something* useful
12:03:02 <strcat[m]> instead of an order of 3 fingers just add 3 digits to your PIN
12:03:05 <strcat[m]> why overcomplicate it?
12:03:11 <silentresearch[m> <rny "how is it arrogant and stuborn w"> there is no discussion - i hear we don't want it it's stupid it doesn't make sense etc since the first question asked
12:03:13 <strcat[m]> order of fingers is a knowledge factor
12:03:13 <strcat[m]> a finger
12:03:21 <strcat[m]> is not something higher entropy as a choice
12:03:22 <strcat[m]> than a digit
12:03:26 <strcat[m]> 10 fingers, 10 digits
12:03:31 <strcat[m]> choosing one repeatedly in a series
12:03:33 <rny> silentresearch[m: nobody said its stupid, it just has lower entropy as strcat[m] pointed out.
12:03:33 <strcat[m]> that's the same entropy
12:03:43 <strcat[m]> realistically also
12:03:44 <strcat[m]> it's 3-4 fingers
12:04:07 <strcat[m]> unless you're swapping around phone between hands and scanning thumbs / pinky
12:04:08 <strcat[m]> pretty awkward
12:04:11 <silentresearch[m> nope - if your phone has a front facing fprint sensor it's fairly convenient to use 10 fingers
12:04:19 <take_a_deep_brea> <silentresearch[m "there is no discussion - i hear "> and you are still ignoring all the reasons given as to why...
12:04:19 <strcat[m]> and again, it's just a choice of 10 possible things
12:04:20 <strcat[m]> like choosing a digit
12:04:28 <strcat[m]> and if you have 1 finger, you hopefully have the rest
12:04:30 <strcat[m]> I mean
12:04:36 <strcat[m]> I hope you haven't had a few fingers chopped off
12:04:43 <strcat[m]> is that the threat model?
12:04:43 <rny> and the fingerprint scanner misses the scan quite often too
12:04:45 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
12:04:47 <silentresearch[m> and again I doubt that a series of frpints has a lower entropy than 1 fprint
12:04:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> or if you have an extra finger
12:05:01 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: it's not the comparison being made
12:05:02 <nihilarian[m]> Hi all! Hope you are doing well. I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me get graphene os installed on my pixel 4a. I have followed all the steps but when it is being installed, it will load into "fastbootd" and I get this error. Any idea what I may be doing wrong? "fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable."
12:05:16 <silentresearch[m> It is the comparison made by me
12:05:16 <strcat[m]> what you have + what you know is the proposal
12:05:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> nihilarian: let me guess, debian?
12:05:26 <strcat[m]> you want the 'what you know' factor to be done by an order of fingerprints
12:05:41 <strcat[m]> either way 'what you have' (fingers) is comparable
12:05:44 <nihilarian[m]> I was on mint at first but I have installed win 10 and tried the flash-all.bat
12:06:02 <silentresearch[m> no... you don't understand - I want the what you have factor to be done by a series of fprints and the what you know factor by a PIN or passphrase
12:06:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> nihilarian: i will be there to help out in pm in a bit
12:06:18 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: that doesn't make sense
12:06:24 <somenerd[m]> > no... you don't understand - I want the what you have factor to be done by a series of fprints and the what you know factor by a PIN or passphrase
12:06:24 <somenerd[m]> how does that work?
12:06:25 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: and it isn't what you're proposing
12:06:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> i have had too many reports of this issue suddenly so maybe there's an actual issue
12:06:37 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: you're misunderstanding how the definition of that works
12:06:45 <strcat[m]> an order of fingerprints that you remember == what you know
12:06:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> i'd want to actually find out what's up
12:06:49 <silentresearch[m> I didn't propose anything - I said I want to increase the lvl of security with moving from 1frpint to a series of fprints
12:06:52 <strcat[m]> look
12:06:55 <strcat[m]> write the numbers
12:06:57 <strcat[m]> 0 to 9
12:06:59 <parakeetos[m]> While it's just as safe than what we got is considerably more inconvenient and requieres extra job. It doesn't seems of any utility to the current users or devs. If you want that feature just do it yourself and enjoy
12:07:00 <strcat[m]> on your fingers
12:07:00 <nihilarian[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "nihilarian: i will be there to h"> Thank you!!
12:07:06 <silentresearch[m> I am not talking about 2FA
12:07:06 <strcat[m]> write 0-9 on your fingers
12:07:07 <strcat[m]> okay?
12:07:11 <strcat[m]> register them with the device
12:07:13 <take_a_deep_brea> <silentresearch[m "no... you don't understand - I w"> why doesnt adding 10 more digits serve the purpose ? or just five extra random alphabets?
12:07:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> nihilarian: pm me though
12:07:17 <strcat[m]> as fingers 0-9
12:07:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> busy with something important rn
12:07:25 <strcat[m]> now, scan them in some series, as you propose
12:07:29 <strcat[m]> do you see that what you are doing
12:07:32 <strcat[m]> is entering a PIN
12:07:48 <strcat[m]> the distinction is that sure, you're confirming, you have these fingers
12:07:55 <silentresearch[m> the longer the pass phrase the longer it takes to enter it - it's fairly quick to enter a series of fprints
12:08:06 <strcat[m]> look
12:08:07 <strcat[m]> we're not interested in this
12:08:13 <strcat[m]> explained why
12:08:28 <silentresearch[m> <strcat[m] "we're not interested in this"> trust me I understood that ;)
12:08:45 <strcat[m]> we don't want to focus on biometric unlock and in particular not one specific form of it - and it makes more sense to do the PIN input separately
12:08:55 <silentresearch[m> now - just for the fun of it -
12:09:00 <strcat[m]> rather than entering a PIN via fingerprints
12:09:04 <silentresearch[m> a series of fprints would be exactly what YOU want
12:09:07 <strcat[m]> which is what you propose, even if you don't see that's what you proposed
12:09:17 <silentresearch[m> because it can also combine the what you have and what you know at once
12:09:26 <silentresearch[m> think abou that for a moment
12:09:26 <strcat[m]> no, it isn't what we want
12:09:40 <somenerd[m]> > because it can also combine the what you have and what you know at once
12:09:40 <somenerd[m]> fingerprint+PIN already does that
12:09:41 <somenerd[m]> and is simpler
12:09:58 <silentresearch[m> fingerprint+pin needs 2 different input methods
12:10:01 <strcat[m]> there are 3 clear reasons we don't want it, explained above
12:10:11 <silentresearch[m> fprint series WITHOUT pin still does the same job but can be done easier
12:10:15 <strcat[m]> 1) far longer to enter the same amount of entropy
12:10:25 <strcat[m]> 2. conflicts with the existing way biometric unlock works
12:10:25 <silentresearch[m> <strcat[m] "1) far longer to enter the same "> false
12:10:33 <somenerd[m]> yeah but it gets less entropy
12:10:33 <strcat[m]> 3. specific to one form of biometric unlock
12:10:35 <silentresearch[m> <strcat[m] "2. conflicts with the existing w"> true
12:10:40 <parakeetos[m]> <silentresearch[m "false"> Oh boy here we go again
12:10:51 <silentresearch[m> <strcat[m] "3. specific to one form of biome"> true - the safes form of biometric unlock at the moment
12:10:54 <strcat[m]> it's definitely not false that using 10 fingers to enter each digit of a PIN (where each finger corresponds to a digit) takes longer than typing it on the keypad
12:10:58 <strcat[m]> don't bother claiming otherwise
12:11:19 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: fingerprint unlock has far less info than IR-based face scanning
12:11:25 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: much more common duplicates
12:11:39 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: iris scanning is the highest security form of biometric probably
12:11:43 <strcat[m]> and some phones have that
12:11:50 <silentresearch[m> <strcat[m] "silentresearch: fingerprint unlo"> does IR based face scanning work on pixel 3/4?
12:11:59 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: yes Pixel 4 has IR based face scanning
12:12:05 <take_a_deep_brea> silentresearch: just tried that fingerprint tjing manually  its difficult. and i use a passphrase upwards of fifteen letter
12:12:07 <silentresearch[m> ok
12:12:11 <silentresearch[m> I'm on a 3a
12:12:14 <strcat[m]> iris scanning is less convenient especially with glasses which is why they don't do that
12:12:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: first of all if you need this feature
12:12:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> let's see you secure the funds for it
12:12:37 <silentresearch[m> exactly
12:12:41 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: Pixel 4 / 4 XL don't have a fingerprint reader
12:12:46 <strcat[m]> some phones only have IR face scanning
12:12:49 <strcat[m]> some only have iris scanning
12:12:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> i can arrange a fdull time developer to work on your feature
12:12:53 <strcat[m]> some only have fingerprint
12:12:59 <anupritaisno1[m]>  * i can arrange a full time developer to work on your feature
12:13:08 <strcat[m]> the way that biometric unlock works in the OS is also that it's a secondary unlock mechanism only, for good reason
12:13:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> however that will be a separate project from, grapheneos
12:13:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> we are not interested in this feature
12:13:25 <strcat[m]> it only works after the initial unlock of a profile (until session is ended) and has a timeout, an attempt limit
12:13:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> we are not implementing it
12:13:34 <silentresearch[m> <anupritaisno1[m] "i can arrange a fdull time devel"> thx - I have one but he's down with covid-19 at the moment and I don't want to wait to see if it's doable on android LD
12:13:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> got it?
12:13:43 <silentresearch[m> > <@anupritaisno1:m.apex.to> i can arrange a full time developer to work on your feature
12:13:43 <silentresearch[m>  * thx - I have one but he's down with covid-19 at the moment and I don't want to wait to see if it's doable on android :D
12:13:51 <silentresearch[m> yes
12:13:54 <silentresearch[m> I got that
12:14:02 <strcat[m]> it isn't the way we want to approach multi-factor unlock for multiple reasons
12:14:05 <silentresearch[m> but as I said - I didn't make a feature request
12:14:13 <silentresearch[m> I asked if it's technically possible with the auth api at the moment
12:14:14 <strcat[m]> well, we don't want it
12:14:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> silentresearch: if you have someone you can ask them then
12:14:28 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: it's an OS feature
12:14:32 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to do with the API used by apps
12:14:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "we are not interested in this fe"> .
12:14:39 <strcat[m]> apps don't implement the lockscreen
12:14:46 <silentresearch[m> android biometric auth api
12:15:00 <strcat[m]> the API exposed to apps isn't involved
12:15:21 <silentresearch[m> "We are the Borg"
12:15:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <silentresearch[m ""We are the Borg""> oh boy i used to play star war5s a fair bit
12:15:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: work on the kernel stuff
12:15:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> rings back memories
12:15:51 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: need the kernel stuff done
12:15:54 <strcat[m]> I'm dealing with this
12:15:56 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be
12:16:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: it's still compiling
12:16:05 <silentresearch[m> it's about if there is a unique identifier for a fprint or not
12:16:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: make it for each kernel
12:16:15 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: timestamp + the name limit thing
12:16:15 <silentresearch[m> that's my whole question right now ;)
12:16:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: check pm
12:16:32 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: well it's not relevant to the channel
12:16:37 <silentresearch[m> and yes - if it is possible I will implement it in a graphene OS fork - you don't have to
12:16:40 <silentresearch[m> great
12:16:51 <silentresearch[m> I'll now start the same discussion in off-topic
12:17:07 <silentresearch[m> wanna join?
12:17:17 <strcat[m]> no thanks
12:17:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> no
12:17:28 <somenerd[m]> no
12:17:48 <somenerd[m]> this discussion should've started in offtopic imo
12:17:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> i need to also help this guy because this week suddenly there's a huge number of "unbootable" complaints
12:18:02 <strcat[m]> I established why we don't want it and that also explains why I have no interest in it being implemented
12:18:28 <strcat[m]> very interested in the feature we have planned getting interested
12:18:38 <take_a_deep_brea> <anupritaisno1[m] "i need to also help this guy bec"> yep
12:19:36 <silentresearch[m> @strcat:matrix.org: I totally get why you want #28 with a Pixel 4 though :D
12:20:02 <dakotah[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "i need to also help this guy bec"> What is the issue?
12:20:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> dakotah: dunno yet
12:20:47 <dakotah[m]> Dang I was hoping it was just a straightforward thing
12:21:47 <take_a_deep_brea> nope it wasnt for me atleast.
12:22:02 <take_a_deep_brea> i spent two hours with this person.
12:23:23 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: even if only fingerprint unlock existed, it's what we want
12:23:50 <strcat[m]> have explained why
12:24:04 <silentresearch[m> yes - because you are the borg
12:24:52 <silentresearch[m> let me check with my dev if we can contribute to #28 so I can upgrade to a 4
12:26:48 <makingaliasesisa> Yeah I would love that feature🙃
12:27:01 <makingaliasesisa> * Yeah I would love that feature
12:27:06 <silentresearch[m> just do me a favor and admit that a series of fprints AND a PIN have a higher entropy than 1 fprint and a PIN :D
12:27:35 * splidge[m] uploaded an image: MT-meme6894920997494873445.jpg (21KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/jbIkZBqvTTyGsbNRvGfekYcO/MT-meme6894920997494873445.jpg >
12:28:13 <somenerd[m]> > just do me a favor and admit that a series of fprints AND a PIN have a higher entropy than 1 fprint and a PIN :D
12:28:13 <somenerd[m]> depends on the PIN and fingerprints
12:28:14 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: no, entering digits via series of fingerprints does not have more entropy than entering them as part of a PIN
12:28:27 <strcat[m]> finger 1, finger 2, finger 3, finger 4
12:28:28 <strcat[m]> vs.
12:28:33 <strcat[m]> 1234 entered via keypad
12:28:46 <strcat[m]> + a fingerprint
12:28:53 <strcat[m]>  * + a fingerprint
12:29:00 <strcat[m]> we are not comparing some arbitrary thing
12:29:04 <somenerd[m]> and is kinda useless (3-4 fingerprints are the equivalent of 3-4 extra numbers)
12:29:14 <strcat[m]> we are comparing the alternative ways of entering digits
12:29:22 <strcat[m]> and we don't want to enter them that way
12:29:28 <strcat[m]> as explained above
12:29:33 <makingaliasesisa> And it would also a big pain lol
12:29:36 <strcat[m]> and we don't need a redundant way to do stuff
12:29:56 <strcat[m]> think I have made it clear why we don't want it
12:30:08 <strcat[m]> you're free to disagree but you don't determine what we are going to do
12:30:37 <take_a_deep_brea> <silentresearch[m "just do me a favor and admit tha"> it wont have higher entropy than a longer  passphrase , which is easier to do than juggle the phone between my fingers, less conspicuous too
12:32:38 <silentresearch[m> <take_a_deep_brea "it wont have higher entropy than"> don't compare apples to bananas compare 1 fprint to a series of fprints and then add either pin or pass in whatever length
12:33:25 <somenerd[m]> it's not too significant (3-4 fingerprints)
12:33:43 <somenerd[m]> probably not equilavent to a factor
12:33:44 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: just stop, it's not a valid argument
12:33:49 <somenerd[m]>  * probably not equilavent to an extra factor
12:34:23 <silentresearch[m> 1 + 2 = 3 | 3 +2 = 5
12:34:23 <strcat[m]> a series of fingerprints is just using fingerprints to enter a PIN
12:34:35 <silentresearch[m> but yeah I won't comment any further
12:34:35 <strcat[m]> stop
12:35:46 <silentresearch[m>  * 1 + 2 = 3 | 3 +2 = 5   5 > 3 = i win
12:36:05 <silentresearch[m>  * 1 + 2 = 3 | 3 +2 = 5  | 5 > 3 = I win!
12:36:31 <splidge[m]> All of my graphene phones work sweet as bruh.
12:36:40 <silentresearch[m> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 exists since 2019
12:36:49 <silentresearch[m> you sure you really want that?
12:37:02 <silentresearch[m> it doesn't look like anyone is actively working on it
12:37:04 <take_a_deep_brea> <splidge[m] "All of my graphene phones work s"> good to know
12:37:18 <splidge[m]> I luv graphene.
12:37:52 <splidge[m]> I am saving to buy another phone so my my Pixel 3a XL can be my mom's new phone.
12:38:30 <take_a_deep_brea> great! go for a 4a if you are on budget and want graphene!
12:38:51 <take_a_deep_brea> and want longest support as of now
12:38:56 <splidge[m]> Woaoh.... Mintaker.
12:39:02 <splidge[m]> Mindtaker
12:39:47 <silentresearch[m> how's the battery life of a 4a?

12:46:15 <silentresearch[m> so who is working on https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 now?
12:47:10 <strcat[m]> no one is working on it atm
12:47:28 <strcat[m]> and the issue exists from before 2019
12:47:38 <silentresearch[m> you sure you WANT that then?
12:47:44 <strcat[m]> the original is https://github.com/AndroidHardeningArchive/legacy_bugtracker/issues/451
12:47:48 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: yes... I am sure we want it
12:47:50 <strcat[m]> it was filed in 2016
12:47:59 <strcat[m]> that doesn't mean I came up with the idea then, I probably sketched it out earlier
12:48:06 <strcat[m]> that date is when I filed it
12:48:10 <silentresearch[m> so why haven't you done it yet?
12:48:19 <strcat[m]> because I don't have infinite time?
12:48:23 <strcat[m]> why haven't you done it?
12:48:29 <somenerd[m]> lower priority
12:48:40 <somenerd[m]> (probably idk)
12:48:44 <silentresearch[m> what's the estimated time frame for the implementation?
12:48:49 <strcat[m]> it's not low priority but implementing a UI is not my strength and I have to do most of the maintenance
12:48:49 <silentresearch[m> if one would work full time on it
12:48:52 <strcat[m]> and manage the whole project
12:48:56 <strcat[m]> silentresearch: don't know
12:49:04 <strcat[m]> a UI only implementation is pretty straightforward
12:49:17 <silentresearch[m> ok I'll talk to my devs and see what can be done
12:49:21 <strcat[m]> trying to come up with a way to integrate it into the keystore etc. is harder
12:49:26 <strcat[m]> not mandatory
15:29:32 <stencil[m]> You do realize dude was trolling, he/she even said it
15:30:01 <silentresearch[m> ?
15:35:10 <take_a_deep_brea> stencil: i think they were genuinely interested in their feature. perhaps a bit _too_ interested.
15:37:11 <rikkyamsterdam> Hello
15:37:26 <rikkyamsterdam> Can someone tell me
15:37:44 <rikkyamsterdam> Where i can get grapheneos phone
15:40:08 <chris42> I don't think you can buy it readily made. You will need to buy one of the supported devices (https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices) and the install grapheneOS
15:41:02 <chris42> ups sorry, that er the recommended ones. supported are: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
15:41:54 <strcat[m]> rikkyamsterdam: there are companies selling devices with it but the project itself does not atm
15:41:59 <strcat[m]> and probably won't until we have hardware produced for us
15:42:03 <fll[m]> Recommended is to buy a Pixel 4a for longest lifetime
15:42:09 <deappledapple> You can ask for help after attempting to [install](https://grapheneos.org/install) GrapheneOS on officially [supported devices](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices)
15:42:43 <deappledapple> 32 months as of this day
15:42:50 <deappledapple> (or 33)
15:44:52 <chmod700[m]> I've been daily driving this rom for over 6 months now
15:44:53 <chmod700[m]> Thank you devs!!! ❤️
15:45:26 <nscnt[m]> ... at least. It's still called minimum update and support period.
15:46:38 <deappledapple> <nscnt[m] "... at least. It's still called "> Well, you'd have no firmware updates outside that so...
15:50:02 <nscnt[m]> I'm talking about that. The official dates are a minimum period.
15:51:05 <nscnt[m]> It's just not guaranteed after that date, but they might support it longer.
15:52:14 <deappledapple> Unless there's some other motivation that they'd have Qualcomm continue their patches, I don't see it being extended that much
15:53:44 <deappledapple> For GrapheneOS, yeah, the support may extended over a bit, but Pixel 2 is already out (and is done for after two months), but that small extension may be crucial for device transition
15:54:04 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Unless there's some other motiva"> This is on upstream
16:19:18 <silentresearch[m> Did anyone ever try to run an xmpp server (prosody) on GrapheneOS?
16:19:46 <silentresearch[m>  *
16:19:46 <silentresearch[m> Did anyone ever try to run a xmpp server (prosody) on GrapheneOS?
16:57:21 <gross_papaya[m]> Didn't try it but I see no point why it should not work
18:18:51 <lumpenqueer[m]> Is this a place where one can ask questions about grapheme?
18:23:04 <ahmouse> does anyone know where I can find more info on Oneplus's verified boot?
18:23:21 <ahmouse> Since it's apparently broken
18:24:49 <lumpenqueer[m]> <ahmouse "does anyone know where I can fin"> Maybe XDA?
18:27:48 <ahmouse> hmm i found a post on the 3t having other bootloader issues, but thats irrelevant by now
18:33:00 <graphiteos[m]> <lumpenqueer[m] "Is this a place where one can as"> yes it is
18:34:19 <lumpenqueer[m]> So I was wondering about functionality with the back up system
18:34:39 <graphiteos[m]> gOS uses seedvault
18:34:55 <lumpenqueer[m]> Lemme Google that
18:35:19 <graphiteos[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS-Archive/platform_external_seedvault/releases
18:35:48 <lumpenqueer[m]> Basically my question is does the twelve word pneumonic change for every backup?
18:37:00 <graphiteos[m]> what do you mean with every backup?
18:37:13 <graphiteos[m]> I guess the awnser is no
18:37:21 <graphiteos[m]> it stays the same for every davice or I guess user profile
18:40:50 <lumpenqueer[m]> Like, if I run a backup now, and memorize the bip39 pneumonic, will I have to memorize I new one for the next backup
18:42:08 <hello-world-222> im trying to install graphene on a pixel xl 3, but the oem unlock option is greyed out
18:42:28 <hello-world-222> it says connect to the internet to unlock, but it still is locked
18:43:51 <ahmouse> do you have a verizon model?
18:45:25 <ahmouse>  if so, then you cannot unlock the bootloader
18:47:09 <lumpenqueer[m]> <hello-world-222 "it says connect to the internet "> I found that connecting it to both WiFi and a data plan made it work
18:47:30 <hello-world-222> i dont know which model, the seller said it was unlocked to all carriers
18:47:34 <hello-world-222> is there a way to check?
18:47:53 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <hello-world-222 "is there a way to check?"> Is the IMEI or Serial Number visible?
18:48:02 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Don't post it here if it is.
18:48:14 <hello-world-222> i dont see it
18:48:23 <hello-world-222> also am connected to both wifi and data
18:48:53 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Go here https://store.google.com/repair
18:48:53 <M0xC0ncord[m]> and enter the IMEI or SN and it will tell you
18:49:09 <hello-world-222> how do i find the IMEI?
18:49:26 <M0xC0ncord[m]> You can find the IMEI in Settings -> About phone
18:50:13 <hello-world-222> im there, but dont see anything labeled IMEI
18:50:26 <take_a_deep_brea> <hello-world-222 "im trying to install graphene on"> hello hello-world-222  please read this section https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking
18:50:27 <hello-world-222> nevermind, found it
18:58:31 <hello-world-222> okay I checked, it says US VZ, im guessing that is verizon?
19:01:18 <lumpenqueer[m]> I can't think of any other thing it would be, but I'm not an expert, so pls don't rely on just my word
19:02:01 <hello-world-222> well thats really a shame
19:11:09 <lumpenqueer[m]> Hi friend
19:38:51 <disjunction[m]> Since installing GrapheneOS, the background of the Google logo when booting is now black instead of white. Is this normal?
19:39:43 <take_a_deep_brea> disjunction: yes
19:40:05 <disjunction[m]> Thank you for informing me about this.
19:40:21 <take_a_deep_brea> that is so that the transition to the grapheneOS boot animation is seamless
19:57:49 <r0tt0r[m]> if you want black wallpaper with the logo i can send you the script
19:59:52 <r0tt0r[m]> or the wallpaper directly
20:03:33 <r0tt0r[m]> i use that for the lockscreen
20:10:46 <graphiteos[m]> <lumpenqueer[m] "Like, if I run a backup now, and"> no the phrase stays the same
20:30:20 <quickquestion> hi, if anyone can answer a quick question, for some stupid reason i installed then uninstalled google play store and services apps (sideloaded) on my pixel 4a with graphene os. are their effects completely removed?
20:41:09 <pikey[m]> i can't speak as an expert by any means, but if it were me I would reload graphene from scratch, to be sure
20:50:34 <notcomplex[m]> hi all - random issue popped up a while back - probably just my device (pixel 3) but perhaps someone else has experienced it: Is anyone else having trouble opening up the bluetooth/networking page in their settings? If I long press the icon in the drawer or navigate through the settings panel it takes about 30 seconds for the bluetooth page to open and select the device I want to connect to.
21:05:30 <LemmyCaution> Can Graphene OS be installed on a Pixel 2xl?
21:08:36 <bentley> LemmyCaution: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
21:09:31 <bentley> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1346720109126152192
21:11:39 <LemmyCaution> Obviously I have read the FAQ. Why there are releases available if they are not supported? I have tried installing from Windows 10 - 2 different laptops - onto a new out of a sealed box Pixel 2xl. It's running Android 10 - I saw a message that claimed Android 11 was not compatible.
21:13:02 <bentley> pixel 2s were supported for a long time. now that they receive no upstream security patches, they're not. thus, they're unsupported.
21:14:25 <LemmyCaution> Thanks Bentley  - just re-read: Why are older devices no longer supported? from the FAQ - Guess I'll have to buy a newer phone and put something else on this 2XL -
21:15:39 <bentley> i imagine grapheneos, even unsupported, will be the best choice for an out-of-date pixel 2. not like any other roms will be receiving security updates either.
21:19:00 <randomusertester> Are there any things someone should do to harden GrapheneOS after installing?
21:20:51 <LemmyCaution> Does 'Unsupported' mean 'Uninstallable'?
21:22:27 <bentley> randomusertester: it's a good idea to set up multiple profiles. the faq suggests putting all your apps in a secondary profile, and using it as your "real" profile
21:24:55 <bentley> LemmyCaution: there's a release available, so naturally it's installable
21:25:35 <bentley> but fixing bugs related to an obsolete device's hardware is probably going to be a low priority, or not done at all
21:26:21 <bentley> since time would be better spent either work that would benefit current devices, or pave the way to support on new devices
21:27:30 <bentley> things are looking up for the future: the next line of pixels will have a longer support period than previous gens have had
21:32:17 <cyberparty> Currently I'm on a Pixel 4a. Whilst using my secondary profile, I'm finding that apps seem to have a longer cold boot time (ranging from 300ms to a full second) unless the same app is also installed (not necessarily running) on the owner profile, where it has a normal (approx 100ms) cold boot time, taking into account GrapheneOS's exec spawning model.
21:32:17 <cyberparty> Is this to be expected?
21:36:15 <kkm6761[m]> hi there first time using matrix. are there any threads like in forums?
21:43:53 <LemmyCaution> Bentley - thanks - I do not see that Google has published EOL for the Pixel 3 or 4.
21:44:47 <kkm6761[m]> i am new and late to android and don't know much if anything. on the "releases" page of graphenos site, there are zip files for the pixels. i wish to build/port graphene os for a non supported device. but those have no zip files, just a link to github. what should I do? is there no generic image of grapheneos?
21:46:20 <LemmyCaution> Trying to install Graphene OS taimen-factory-2021.01.06.14.zip. Device is 'seen' by both ADB and Fastboot but hangs at Flash-all - :waiting for any device:
22:21:39 <Amvu[m]> Hi! How can I install grapheneOS on my xiaomi redmi note 8 pro?
22:23:34 <sphinxcat[m]> Amvu: it's not officially supported: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
22:30:46 <new2graphene> Hello, look for any help regarding a fresh install of Graphene that intermittently reboots, to a bootloader? boot loop
22:30:51 <new2graphene> On a pixel 3
22:55:46 <aeonius> Does anyone know if (and how) it's possible to add a dictionary to the default keyboard? It currently supports (on my device anyway) just a few languages, German, English (US), English, Spanish, French, Italian and what looks like Russian. No Dutch :(
23:17:33 <LemmyCaution> Found an answer to my question -Windows 10 - minimal recovery tools loaded - etc. Pixel 2xl >SDK\Fastboot Flash-all would hang at <waiting for any device>. Once at <wait for any device> : Boot into Bootloader: Turn power off on the Pixel 2xl, press/hold Power - then press volume down etc - Powershell SDK\Fastboot proceeds with installtion.
23:35:42 <hanetzer> question. not a grapheneos user (I don't have a supported device) but what would you guys suggest for relatively secure sms in android?
23:36:08 <jameshandcockand> SMS isn't secure ever
23:36:23 <jameshandcockand> For an open source app you could use qksms or the AOSP one
23:36:56 <cyberparty> For secure messaging, Signal and Molly are good.
23:37:57 <hanetzer> signal only available on gplay tho unless I'm missing something.
23:38:07 <Knull[m]> molly also requires phone number still though, like signal
23:38:12 <bentley> hanetzer: you're missing something: it's available as apk too
23:38:25 <bentley> https://signal.org/android/apk/
23:38:26 <hanetzer> gotcha, so adb sideload or the like
23:38:41 <bentley> or just install the apk, no adb needed
23:38:50 <hanetzer> yeah.
23:39:10 <applejuice[m]> what benefits does molly have over just the normal Signal?
