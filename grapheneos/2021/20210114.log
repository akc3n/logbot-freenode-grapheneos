00:00:33 <bowbag> great, thanks
00:03:26 <bowbag> can anyone point to a place I could grab the google stock image for a pixel 4a? if I need to flash it back
00:12:44 <deappledapple> <bowbag "can anyone point to a place I co"> https://developers.google.com/android/images
00:18:10 <bowbag> perfect, thanks
00:49:46 <narcoli[m]> started using telegram FOSS can confirm works stellar on graphene
01:35:38 <b1101> signal > telegram
01:42:35 <deappledapple> <b1101 "signal > telegram"> No disagreement, they just said it works, not much of a necessity for this imho
01:42:46 <deappledapple> Can be discussed in offtopic, feel free
01:43:35 <louipc> narcoli[m]: thanks for sharing. there's another channel #grapheneos-offtopic. its a good place to chat about 3rd party apps, or just tech in general
01:44:02 <b1101> ya, I was just about to say he's not in there.
01:53:48 <ThoughtMonster[m> Just finally got graphene os successfully installed on my pixel 4a. Failed on Ubuntu and MacOS, but Windows did the trick. I knew I needed to keep all those computers. üòÑ Just dropping in to say thank you for building it.
01:57:36 <louipc> lol nice
02:10:14 <b1101> is there any way to disable the messaging app, so I don't see it in my drawer? not allowed by default
02:12:05 <deappledapple> <b1101 "is there any way to disable the "> Nope, in GrapheneOS itself, not really
02:38:49 <TheJollyRoger> ThoughtMonster[m: yarr, glad to hear you got it working!
02:38:53 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship!
02:39:55 <ruddo[m]> <ThoughtMonster[m "Just finally got graphene os suc"> Whhat seemed to have been the problem?  I flash from a Qubes OS VM all the time, just passthrough the USB device and it just works.
02:40:34 <TheJollyRoger> Sometimes USB passthrough can vary, depending on support, kernel version, and also your hardware and the drivers.
02:40:51 <anonhat[m]> Isn't that advised against in the official documentation due to lack of reliability in the hypervisor's implementation of USB passthrough?
02:41:04 <TheJollyRoger> It is. Sometimes the quality of USB passthrough can vary, considerably, depending on what your configuration is.
02:41:46 <TheJollyRoger> I mean, it can and sometimes does work, but occasionally we run into problems with certain combinations. Since we cannot test them all we determined it would be safer to simply advise people not to flash from within a virtual machine.
02:42:26 <anonhat[m]> I wonder if Crostini works...
02:42:33 <anonhat[m]> Gonna test it.
02:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> Fingers crossed!
02:46:33 <ThoughtMonster[m> ruddo: I don‚Äôt know. In Ubuntu I got a list of ‚Äúarchive does not contain‚Äù file errors, then it would try to reboot and fail. I followed the instructions exactly, and even did a clean Ubuntu installation and retried it on that. Then the Mac gave me a different error - ‚Äúusb_write failed with status e0002ed.‚Äù
03:17:14 <RockWest> I'm trying to flash onto a pixel 4XL from ubuntu. Things went as per the instructions however it keeps stalling on the same line in the flash script
03:17:50 <RockWest> Sending sparse 'vendor_b' 1/4 (262140 KB)
03:19:44 <RockWest> Any suggestions on where to look for error codes, or more details?
03:27:32 <b1101> damn. and now I just ran into google fi issues :(
03:28:13 <b1101> can't receive mms/pictures. plain sms come with random characters following the messages
03:32:42 <qr3461> I am interested in Graphene OS. I see that the Google Pixel 4a can be used for Graphene
03:33:04 <qr3461> I noticed there were multiple Pixel 4a in the Google store, which one is the recommended one for the Graphene?
03:33:26 <qr3461> There was a Verizon, Google Fi, and an Unlocked version
03:33:51 <louipc> unlock
03:34:51 <qr3461> what is the difference between the 3?
03:35:04 <b1101> unlocked let's you use any provider
03:35:06 <qr3461> My understanding is the Verizon is not compatible with Graphene due to a locked bootloader
03:35:15 <b1101> and that ^
03:35:31 <qr3461> What about the Google Fi, version?
03:35:41 <qr3461> that only works with Google Fi I am assuming?
03:35:43 <b1101> that should be unlocked I think too
03:36:15 <b1101> but still. you're better of getting unlocked
03:36:18 <qr3461> okay, so it sounds like the Unlocked, Pixel 4a (non 5G version) is the correct choice then?
03:36:56 <qr3461> Pixel 4a should also have the longest support of the current Pixel models I am assuming, given it is the newest version?
03:43:58 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
03:55:37 <anonhat[m]> Correct. Any carrier-provided Pixel will usually have a locked bootloader, and will therefore be incapable of accepting aftermarket operating systems via Fastboot.
03:55:55 <anonhat[m]> > My understanding is the Verizon is not compatible with Graphene due to a locked bootloader
03:55:55 <anonhat[m]> Correct. Any carrier-provided Pixel will usually have a locked bootloader, and will therefore be incapable of accepting aftermarket operating systems via Fastboot.
03:57:24 <qr3461> Thank you for the info
04:49:54 <randomiser2021[m> Question regarding obtaining supported pixel devices. Do you guys buy them directly from google or is there a recommended third party for refurbished units?
04:51:30 <Thatcher[m]> I bought my Pixel 4a from Best Buy
04:53:09 <narcoli[m]> <louipc "narcoli: thanks for sharing. the"> ok good to know thanks!
04:53:29 <RockWest> I got my last two pixels from well rated ebay sellers
04:54:22 <TheJollyRoger> randomiser2021[m: generally the safest bet is to buy them from directly from Google. That's generally the safest path. Outside of that, you're on your own.
04:56:29 <TheJollyRoger> randomiser2021[m: Buying refurbished units can be a minefield. We've heard anecdotal reports of units being refurbished with substandard batteries or worse, carrier locked units being mixed up and sold as unlocked ones, or even unscrupulous sellers that use exploits to attempt to pass off bootloader locked versions of the phones as unlocked ones.
04:56:48 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, the latter case actually occurred here to one chatter here.
04:58:22 <TheJollyRoger> Generally, what tends to happen is that when the phones are taken off the google store, the resellers will then immediately try to shift the stock that they have, flooding the market with secondhand devices, which may or may not be locked. The phones might not have their original packaging anymore.
04:59:30 <randomiser2021[m> Thank you @TheJollyRoger - appreciate your input. I will order my unit from Google.
05:01:01 <squarmkt[m]> Can try best buy or something and you can check OEM unlocking
05:02:07 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. randomiser2021[m, if you can, use a credit card and make sure it's got solid buyer protection policies on it; this way, the merchants are incentivized to work with you because credit card companies can claw the money back in the case of fraud.
05:03:33 <TheJollyRoger> Usually when they do they also sting the merchant with a chargeback fee, but note that this also hurts your credit as well.
05:03:37 <TheJollyRoger> So it's the nuclear option.
06:10:50 <theOne[m]> How do I stop my device making thumbnails of every photo and screenshot??
06:15:28 <anonhat[m]> Stop taking photos and screenshots.
06:15:52 <anonhat[m]> In all seriousness, I don't think that's easily done in Android.
06:16:15 <TheJollyRoger> theOne[m]: place an empty file called ".nomedia" in the directory your media is.
06:16:29 <anonhat[m]> :O
06:16:43 <TheJollyRoger> This will signal any gallery applications or applications using the gallery to ignore the contents of that directory.
06:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure to have the leading dot.
06:18:37 <TheJollyRoger> You can then turn off "show hidden files and folders" so you don't see the ugly little ".nomedia" file.
06:20:47 <theOne[m]> Okie thanks
06:28:18 <theOne[m]> Amazing, so I put .nomedia in my Pictures folder
06:28:24 <theOne[m]> And it won't let me screenshot at all now
06:28:28 <theOne[m]> Great
06:29:04 <TheJollyRoger> That's bizarre. Let me try.
06:30:50 <theOne[m]> That's what I wanted anyway
06:31:22 <TheJollyRoger> theOne[m]: looks like it does that for me too. I remove the .nomedia and it goes away.
06:31:36 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if this behaviour is intentional or not...?
06:53:22 <RockWest> That's pretty unexpected, strange
08:33:04 <LJ80> Anyone knows which (privacy save) mail client works with Exchange
08:34:15 <take_a_deep_brea> LJ80: could you take this query to the off-topic channel ? as it is not directly relevant to grapheneOS itself ?
08:34:32 <LJ80> ok
08:38:58 <davismountain777> What are differences between bromite browser and vanadium browser grom graphene?
08:44:58 <TheLoneWanderer[> Vanadium focuses on security while Bromite focuses on privacy

10:04:40 <Sa32> Anyone able to help with Graphene install on Pixal 3?
10:06:58 <take_a_deep_brea> well i would have loved too but right now i am a bit occupied with something else . but if you stick around then i guarantee you someone will show up to help you with the installation
10:07:35 <take_a_deep_brea> just keep in mind that you will be fine if you just use the official guide : https://grapheneos.org/install
10:08:58 <take_a_deep_brea> please do not follow instructions in some youtube video  or a third-party website as it makes the installation process longer and more arduous as more often than not these sites just make things unnecesarily complicated
10:09:51 <take_a_deep_brea> and people end up here with an improperly flashed device and its more difficult to take it up from there .
10:10:25 <baldgeek123[m]> Hello everyone. I installed GrapheneOS on the Pixel 4a recently. I can make normal ( unencrypted ) phone calls very well on the Jio network in India, but when receiving calls no sound can be heard on both parties of the call.
10:10:42 <baldgeek123[m]> What shall I do to solve this?
10:10:43 <take_a_deep_brea> Sa32:  but anyways just stick around for a few hours . someone will certainly show up
10:13:58 <Sa32> Thanks!
10:14:20 <Sa32> I actually can't figure out how to update the bootloader on the phone - the grapheneos install instructions are great
10:16:01 <TheLoneWanderer[> Do you mean unlock the bootloader?
10:17:03 <Sa32> No
10:17:10 <Sa32> Device version-bootloader is 'b1c1-0.3-6623201'.
10:17:10 <Sa32> Update requires 'b1c1-0.3-6863019'.
10:17:32 <Sa32> I assume it needs flashing rather than being done inside androidOS
10:17:53 <Sa32> https://dl.msfjarvis.dev/pixel/blueline-rq1a.201205.003/
10:18:17 <Sa32> Looks like the files are here. I can follow instructions but powershell is a bit beyond my abilities otherwise
10:20:43 <take_a_deep_brea> Sa32:  all you need to do is update the stock android OS as it comes with the latest android OS , firmware updates which naturally includes the bootloader
10:21:06 <Sa32> Hmmm AFAIK I have installed all available updates
10:21:16 <Sa32> Will see if I can confirm cos that sounds like it's the answer
10:24:08 <catfish[m]> <Sa32 "Will see if I can confirm cos th"> Yes just go to system / advanced / update...   took quite a long time on mine
10:24:42 <Sa32> Yeah I can see one has been paused - that'd be it
10:24:43 <Sa32> thanks all!
10:25:54 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem.
10:42:56 <Kiwi95> Hello, just trying to install GrapheneOS and got into the "waiting for any device" problem. I saw different solutions online but wanted to make shure that I ask the right peoble. Is there a past conversation that would explain me what I have to do or could anybody here help me out? I am using Windows 10. When I put myPixel 4a in bootloader mode the
10:42:56 <Kiwi95> device doesn't show up under the "fastboot flashing unlock" command. Would be nice if anybody could help :)
10:51:17 <TheLoneWanderer[> Hey Kiwi95, you need to install the drivers. Check Windows Update
10:52:58 <Kiwi95> Hey TheLoneWanderer[ I did everything like the grapheneOS guide said. I also checked and installed the latest Windows updates
10:54:08 <TheLoneWanderer[> Did you check for optional updates in Windows Updates?
10:56:12 <Kiwi95> That might the point, I didn't. I'll try it again :)
11:11:31 <baldgeek123[m]> Do people have this issue on other carriers around the world?
11:11:46 <baldgeek123[m]> I might switch if it is limited to Jio
12:05:06 <Sa84> How do you do adblocking in Graphene?
12:05:07 <Sa84> And what method for verifying signatures of apks? (for example: This SHA256 fingerprint of the signing certificate can be used to verify the downloaded APK)
12:25:05 <yeshh711[m]> <Sa84 "How do you do adblocking in Grap"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking-apps
12:56:49 <seq4923[m]> Will the new ProtonVPN app maybe also be a good option? (currently in beta)
12:56:49 <seq4923[m]> Combining a real VPN and adblock. And I think they also take care of DNS.
13:03:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are going to start testing for pixel 5
13:04:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry. Nobody volunteered for the 4a 5g yet but if you have one pm me
13:04:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway to join the testing you can pm me
13:05:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that switching from the testing build to the official release we'll have later on will erase all data
13:06:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 4a 5g users can join the test
13:08:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it'll be a while before you'll have testing builds
13:13:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> * We are going to start testing for pixel 5/4a 5g
13:33:52 <atlas56> I have a silly question. on an out of the box unlocked Pixel¬† -can you enable OEM unlocking without having a google account? IOs user here looking to switch.
13:36:26 <jpds> atlas56: Yesa
13:37:34 <r0tt0r[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Remember that switching from the"> woaa, good to know
13:40:24 <atlas56> jpds ty.
14:14:28 <nscnt[m]> atlas56: You don't need a Google account at all. Even if you would set up stock Android.
14:20:50 <atlas56> nscnt[m] Thanks - Looking forward to Pixel 5 support. Might start with 4a and use as a validator for the auditor app.

14:30:15 <atlas56> Just ask. If someone can they will.
14:30:30 <Gladius> i have problems with flashing the google device
14:31:24 <atlas56> have you followed this https://grapheneos.org/install explicitly?
14:32:04 <Gladius> yes i did
14:32:28 <Gladius> but i got always an error when starting the bat file

14:42:29 <Gladius> k
14:43:01 <deappledapple> See again grapheneos.org/install, start over from downloading the platform tools, setting the path, and copy-paste the commands as is (with the exception for image downloading
14:43:57 <deappledapple> Just replace "sunfish" with the codename of your device)
14:45:16 <stencil[m]> I think the problem was the curl part
14:46:13 <deappledapple> Not really, it explicitly says to do this (https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal) before using curl -O

14:50:44 <Gladius> i did it how it was written on the install page
14:54:00 <nscnt[m]> It wouldn't throw an error then
14:57:55 <sb13x[m]> Gladius:  If you're getting the fastboot version error, trust me you're getting it because you have not SET THE PATH correctly.
14:58:18 <Gladius> yes you are right, now i fixed it
14:58:25 <Gladius> thx
15:00:10 <Gladius> thank you very much, now it worked!
15:09:07 <theOne[m]> Is preloading for faster browsing recommended when using vanadium?

16:36:51 <SirJarvis> Hi
16:37:12 <SirJarvis> i was looking for a help with graphene os instalation
16:37:17 <SirJarvis> yesterday
16:37:42 <SirJarvis> but i did unofficial method and due to that i had to reinstall windows etc...
16:37:57 <SirJarvis> anyway today am ready for installation
16:38:14 <SirJarvis> so if somebody could guide me lil bit that will be amazing
16:40:19 <SirJarvis> so today am doing by official method on Pixel 3XL
16:44:42 <stencil[m]> Hello! Please start by reading this once before starting http://grapheneos.org/install
16:45:21 <stencil[m]> SirJarvis: Then we can start(it's a bit long but please read once first!)
16:45:39 <SirJarvis> so now i i already read that
16:46:04 <stencil[m]> Great, so your desktop is?
16:46:29 <SirJarvis> so now am on stage when i copy into powershell curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
16:46:30 <SirJarvis> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip).hash -eq "549ba2bdc31f335eb8a504f005f77606a479cc216d6b64a3e8b64c780003661f"
16:46:30 <SirJarvis> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
16:47:20 <SirJarvis> and then i got error opening archive failed to open platform tools r30.0.05
16:47:40 <stencil[m]> You have done this right?
16:47:40 <stencil[m]> `Remove-Item Alias:Curl`
16:47:40 <stencil[m]> This one is causing lots of recent problems
16:47:44 <SirJarvis> and then i copied this one $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
16:47:55 <SirJarvis> yes that one i did before
16:48:20 <SirJarvis> and after that i tried command fastboot --version
16:48:35 <SirJarvis> and then i got red letter the term fast boot is not reco
16:48:57 <stencil[m]> Oh!
16:49:10 <SirJarvis> and after that i copied this and paste curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
16:49:11 <SirJarvis> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip).hash -eq "549ba2bdc31f335eb8a504f005f77606a479cc216d6b64a3e8b64c780003661f"
16:49:11 <SirJarvis> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
16:49:14 <stencil[m]> So is your OS fully updated?
16:49:20 <SirJarvis> yes
16:49:25 <SirJarvis> i got it all today
16:49:28 <SirJarvis> windows 10
16:49:32 <SirJarvis> fully updated
16:49:43 <SirJarvis> if you want i can shut down power cell
16:49:49 <SirJarvis> powershell
16:50:00 <SirJarvis> and start again with your help if you dont mind
16:51:23 <stencil[m]> You can try restarting, without admin mode
16:51:34 <SirJarvis> ok
16:51:34 <stencil[m]> Admin mode causes a bit of problem
16:51:55 <SirJarvis> i will restart computer now and come back to this chat
16:52:00 <SirJarvis> give me 1 min
16:55:59 <SirJarvis> here is am again
16:56:09 <SirJarvis> so everything has been updated
16:56:23 <SirJarvis> and windows 10 intalled fresh few hours ago
16:56:26 <SirJarvis> so
16:56:44 <SirJarvis> should we start with installation of graphene os
16:57:04 <SirJarvis> btw phone part with oem and usb debug is all sorted
17:01:08 <SirJarvis> btw when pixel is connected
17:01:20 <SirJarvis> i have usb preferences
17:01:30 <SirJarvis> should i leave it on no data transfer
17:01:42 <SirJarvis> or should i turn on file transfer android auto
17:02:10 <SirJarvis> and usb controled by this device or connected device
17:02:16 <SirJarvis> ?
17:06:58 <nscnt[m]> USB debugging is no where mentioned in the guide. It doesn't matter what USB preference you set, because you won't be in the OS anyway.
17:07:15 <SirJarvis> okay
17:07:35 <SirJarvis> so no i tried to check fastboot --version
17:07:41 <SirJarvis> and i got red letters

17:18:31 <SirJarvis> yes
17:18:37 <SwankyBarbecue4[> hey guys, what are the downsides of using an unsupported device like the pixel 2 over a supported device like the pixel 3 or 4? My goals are to get away from google and proprietary software.
17:19:17 <SirJarvis> so this is the first one
17:19:27 <SirJarvis> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
17:19:27 <SirJarvis> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip).hash -eq "549ba2bdc31f335eb8a504f005f77606a479cc216d6b64a3e8b64c780003661f"
17:19:28 <SirJarvis> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
17:19:33 <SirJarvis> this is the second one
17:19:36 <nscnt[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: Having an outdated device and thus it can't be considered secure anymore
17:19:45 <SirJarvis> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
17:19:56 <nscnt[m]> SirJarvis: No, the first one is only
17:19:57 <nscnt[m]> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
17:20:06 <nscnt[m]> And then you press Enter/Return
17:20:19 <nscnt[m]> Then you type in the other command
17:20:59 <SirJarvis> okay i pressed now
17:21:08 <SirJarvis> and nothing came after
17:21:21 <SirJarvis> should i press now fastboot --version
17:22:17 <SirJarvis> i pressed now that to check
17:22:23 <nscnt[m]> I'm sorry, but it feels like you're trying to waste our times. There's a guide. It gives you all the commends you need to put in step-by-step. Do it.
17:22:23 <SirJarvis> and i gotr red letters
17:22:42 <SirJarvis> am not trying to waste anybodys time
17:22:49 <SirJarvis> i just need a help with this
17:23:09 <SirJarvis> i downloaded this platform tools that you send me
17:23:17 <SirJarvis> and what should i do with that zip file
17:23:32 <atlas56> unzip it maybe?
17:23:42 <SirJarvis> and where should i copy that
17:24:20 <SirJarvis> should i keep it on desktop or?
17:27:35 <atlas56> I dont mean to be rude SirJarvis but it appears that you might be trying to bite off more than you can chew. If I were you I would wait for Gab to release the Gabphone
17:28:00 <SirJarvis> i just need help with installing this and thats all
17:28:08 <SirJarvis> like few errors i have
17:28:21 <nscnt[m]> atlas56: what
17:28:25 <SirJarvis> and am trying to fix that with help of comunity here
17:29:15 <nscnt[m]> You will have no errors if you follow the guide. No need to fix anything then
17:29:26 <SirJarvis> i follow exactly the guide
17:29:35 <SirJarvis> and this is what i get
17:29:42 <nscnt[m]> You clearly don't
17:29:43 <SirJarvis> i can start again from the begginign
17:29:56 <SirJarvis> and you will see that i will get an error
17:29:58 <SirJarvis> ok
17:30:02 <yeshh711[m]> <SirJarvis "i follow exactly the guide"> The guide is not designed for beginners
17:30:16 <SirJarvis> i will start again
17:30:55 <mynacol[m]> SirJarvis: read the guide carefully and follow it step by step
17:32:51 <yeshh711[m]> The install guide should be more clear tho.. More aimed for beginners so people would not have problems
17:33:09 <SirJarvis> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
17:33:18 <SirJarvis> when i type this
17:33:23 <SirJarvis> i get my first error
17:33:56 <nscnt[m]> All I could do to help you is pasting all the commands in here. However, that's unnecessary because it's the same as on the website.
17:34:03 <yeshh711[m]> So many people are coming here to ask about troubleshootting and the admins just say follow the guide so it would be better for everyone if the guide would be clear for noobs :D
17:34:18 <SirJarvis> error opening archive: failed to open platform tools_30.0.5-windows.zip
17:34:39 <SirJarvis> and now how to fix that error
17:34:44 <SirJarvis> thats my question
17:35:24 <yeshh711[m]> <SirJarvis "thats my question"> Stop trying these people are not going to help

17:46:08 <nscnt[m]> Let's first check for any driver updates
17:46:24 <nscnt[m]> Go to the classic Windows Update window ("Check for updates")
17:46:39 <nscnt[m]> There might be little link "View optional updates" under the check for updates button
17:46:55 <SirJarvis> i open that
17:47:13 <SirJarvis> there is few boxes
17:47:31 <nscnt[m]> A driver update?
17:47:39 <SirJarvis> from audio device,nvidia, intel, intel graphcs,and lan
17:47:46 <SirJarvis> thats all
17:47:48 <nscnt[m]> "Android Bootloader Interface"
17:47:57 <SirJarvis> nope

17:48:28 <nscnt[m]> Do you have the "View optional updates" at all?
17:48:33 <SirJarvis> yes
17:48:41 <SirJarvis> am already in that
17:48:42 <mynacol[m]> Maybe you have to "search for updates" first?
17:48:57 <nscnt[m]> Maybe you need to search for updates again first, yea
17:49:12 <SirJarvis> i pressed check for updates
17:49:19 <SirJarvis> and am up to date
17:49:48 <nscnt[m]> Is there a new driver update named "Le Mobile ... Android Bootloader Interface" now?
17:49:56 <nscnt[m]> In the optional updates menu
17:50:01 <SirJarvis> yes
17:50:09 <SirJarvis> there are 2 of them

17:50:45 <nscnt[m]> You can
17:50:52 <SirJarvis> ok i will now
17:51:00 <nscnt[m]> No restart is needed after that
17:51:06 <nscnt[m]> Do not close PowerShell
17:51:10 <SirJarvis> ok
17:51:11 <nscnt[m]> or anything else
17:51:32 <nscnt[m]> Tell me when that's done
17:51:34 <SirJarvis> i think its done
17:51:40 <SirJarvis> let me check again
17:51:59 <SirJarvis> yes when i reopen optional updates
17:52:09 <SirJarvis> they are not there anymore
17:52:20 <SirJarvis> so probably that means its downloaded
17:52:24 <nscnt[m]> Go to the PowerShell again
17:52:24 <SirJarvis> and installed
17:52:26 <SirJarvis> ok
17:52:38 <SirJarvis> should i repeat comand
17:52:43 <theOne[m]> Does grapheneos require using an antivirus at all?
17:52:46 <nscnt[m]> No

17:53:04 <SirJarvis> do not lock bootloader
17:53:16 <SirJarvis> and now i guess i can choose with volume keys
17:53:31 <nscnt[m]> Use the volume down button to switch to "unlock bootloader"
17:53:31 <mynacol[m]> <theOne[m] "Does grapheneos require using an"> No. Antivirus is useless under Android
17:53:46 <SirJarvis> ok i will press it now
17:53:47 <nscnt[m]> and press Power button to confirm
17:53:50 <SirJarvis> to unlock

17:55:17 <nscnt[m]> and press enter
17:55:35 <nscnt[m]> this will take some time
17:55:41 <nscnt[m]> is it doing its thing?
17:55:46 <SirJarvis> yes
17:55:51 <SirJarvis> its downloading
17:55:54 <nscnt[m]> ok, we need to wait
17:56:36 <SirJarvis> i guess 2 min left
17:57:57 <SirJarvis> 1 min left
17:58:07 <nscnt[m]> ok
17:58:57 <SirJarvis> done
17:59:12 <nscnt[m]> Next command:
17:59:19 <nscnt[m]> tar xvf crosshatch-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
17:59:21 <nscnt[m]> and press enter
17:59:30 <nscnt[m]> doing its thing again?
17:59:47 <SirJarvis> yes
17:59:51 <SirJarvis> this one was short
18:00:02 <nscnt[m]> next command:

18:00:26 <nscnt[m]> press enter
18:00:33 <SirJarvis> yes
18:00:45 <nscnt[m]> Next command:
18:00:46 <nscnt[m]> ./flash-all.bat
18:00:48 <nscnt[m]> press enter
18:01:08 <nscnt[m]> does it run something
18:01:14 <SirJarvis> now it runs
18:01:24 <nscnt[m]> Don't touch it
18:01:25 <nscnt[m]> Ever
18:01:27 <SirJarvis> phone is on off
18:01:28 <SirJarvis> ok
18:01:46 <nscnt[m]> It will say something like waiting for the device in the middle
18:01:50 <nscnt[m]> don't touch it
18:01:58 <nscnt[m]> It'll take some time
18:02:23 <SirJarvis> so now on powershell its running its own
18:02:31 <nscnt[m]> yes
18:02:35 <SirJarvis> and phone has screen fastbootd
18:02:42 <SirJarvis> with some choices

18:03:51 <nscnt[m]> are you in a regular prompt again?
18:04:00 <nscnt[m]> where you could write something?
18:04:04 <SirJarvis> yes
18:04:12 <nscnt[m]> Next command:
18:04:13 <nscnt[m]> fastboot flashing lock
18:04:15 <nscnt[m]> press enter
18:04:21 <SirJarvis> its actually giving me press any key to exit
18:04:27 <nscnt[m]> You'll need to confirm on the phone
18:04:33 <nscnt[m]> Yes, do that
18:04:43 <SirJarvis> wait
18:04:53 <SirJarvis> so now i will copy comand first on powershell
18:05:02 <SirJarvis> and then confirm on phone
18:05:19 <nscnt[m]> Press any key to exit in PowerShell. Type in the command and confirm the locking on the phone, yes
18:05:28 <nscnt[m]> Don't close PowerShell tho

18:06:42 <nscnt[m]> You confirmed?
18:06:47 <SirJarvis> yes i did
18:06:54 <nscnt[m]> Does it say "locked"?
18:06:58 <SirJarvis> phone is now in fastboot mode locked
18:07:14 <SirJarvis> powershell is still open
18:07:20 <mynacol[m]> SirJarvis: You are almost there

18:08:38 <SirJarvis> powershell should be closed now?
18:08:40 <nscnt[m]> Tell me when you set it up
18:08:51 <nscnt[m]> PowerShell can be closed now, yes
18:09:03 <nscnt[m]> And you can unplug your phone
18:09:54 <SirJarvis> i think i have to restart phone

18:49:40 <isou> hey guys
18:49:58 <isou> can somebody help me ?
18:50:06 <isou> im trying to install graphenos on pixel3A XL
18:50:10 <isou> i have issues here
18:50:11 <isou> ./flash-all.sh: 22: [: Illegal number: 1:81
18:50:11 <isou> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
18:50:19 <isou> im on ubuntu 20.04
18:52:38 <catfish[m]> <isou "can somebody help me ?"> Did you follow this part of the guide https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools ?
19:10:31 <Lemmy> good evening
19:30:29 <Erraverunt> Has there been any recharging power problems reported? I've got second time now phone shows I'm charging via usb tap for more options notification. But I'm not charging. And should not have any physical damage in the charging port because the phone Is quite new.
19:32:29 <jameshandcockand> Sounds like a hardware issue
19:32:59 <jameshandcockand> Try using a different charger, charging cube, or resetting your phone
19:33:45 <Erraverunt> Tried different cables both times, doesn't help but then at some point everything works normally
19:35:45 <jameshandcockand> Sounds like hardware
19:36:22 <jameshandcockand> Try cleaning out your USB-C port too maybe
19:36:45 <Erraverunt> I've cleaned it with air, doesnt help
19:37:18 <jameshandcockand> I would contact the place you bought it from
19:37:37 <jameshandcockand> You could try going back to the stock OS to see if it fixes, but I doubt that the OS is the issue
19:37:53 <jameshandcockand> It wouldn't really make sense that it is the operating system
19:37:58 <Erraverunt> Haven't checked but installing grapheneos propably voided warranty
19:38:32 <Erraverunt> Yeah was thinking the same, just hate the fact that it could be hardware issue and dont really have money and time work over a new phone
19:39:57 <jameshandcockand> I don't think it voided the warranty
19:40:09 <jameshandcockand> Even if it did you can just flash the stock OS and they'd be none the wiser
19:42:29 <Erraverunt> It gets stuck on usb controlled by "connected device" and I cant change to "this device"
19:42:48 <Erraverunt> Its like something just lingers there
19:43:33 <mynacol[m]> Even if you connect it to a wall cube/brick?
19:43:40 <jameshandcockand> Not sure what to tell you boss, try resetting your phone or flashing the stock OS, beyond that it is going to be a hardware issue
19:43:51 <mynacol[m]> We probably should move to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
19:43:59 <Erraverunt> Yeah
19:46:34 <Sam24> hi everyboady
19:46:40 <Sam24> everybody

19:48:21 <Sam24> hoecan i get¬† this phone in dev mode
19:49:02 <jameshandcockand> He's speaking the language of the gods
19:49:39 <Sam24> ?
19:51:40 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: Are you a developer? If not, don't touch the DEVELOPER options.
19:53:04 <jameshandcockand> I've never heard of that being an issue or a thing that developer options is "disabled for your own safety" but maybe someone else can chime in on this one
19:56:42 <Sam24> ¬†signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip

19:56:50 <Sam24> how can i fix this
19:57:56 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: Try to redownload factory.pub
19:58:23 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub
19:59:40 <Sam24> i have this file
19:59:50 * mynacol[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pulLIgfjMtXpaMmtkcUWKsgg/message.txt >
20:04:56 <Sam24> i fastboot mode Device stat lock
20:05:30 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: Follow the official instructions under https://grapheneos.org/install
20:06:09 <mynacol[m]> Other instructions / videos do a bad job
20:06:40 <Sam24> i use this Guid
20:07:17 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: OK. Did you do this: https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
20:07:53 <mynacol[m]> Afterwards, the device should say `unlocked`
20:07:55 <Sam24> fastboot flashing unlock
20:08:26 <mynacol[m]> Exactly
20:09:01 <Sam24> FAILED (remote: 'flashing unlock is not allowed')
20:09:02 <Sam24> fastboot: error: Command failed
20:09:40 <mynacol[m]> OK. Restart at the beginning of the guide. You missed a section.
20:09:58 <mynacol[m]> Just reboot the phone
20:10:28 <Sam24> oke i wil try
20:11:15 <Sam24> Enabling OEM unlocking
20:11:15 <Sam24> OEM unlocking needs to be enabled from within the operating system.
20:11:16 <Sam24> Enable the developer options menu by going to Settings ‚ûî About phone and pressing on the build number menu entry until developer mode is enabled.
20:11:40 <Sam24> when i do this i get This Option is disabled, for your own Safety
20:11:42 <mynacol[m]> Exactly. You missed that.
20:12:14 <mynacol[m]> Did you get your phone from a carrier? Verizon?
20:12:28 <mynacol[m]> I don't know that message
20:13:00 <Sam24> i have¬† already grapheneOS on it
20:13:09 <Sam24> i want to reinstall it
20:14:11 <mynacol[m]> Are you in the owner profile? The one where you boot into
20:14:22 <Sam24> yes
20:15:32 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: Sorry, I don't know that message or what the problem is.
20:16:33 <atlas56> Replacing GrapheneOS with the stock OS
20:16:33 <atlas56> Installation of the stock OS via the stock factory images is the same process described above. However, before locking, there's an additional step to fully revert the device to a clean factory state.
20:16:34 <atlas56> The GrapheneOS factory images flash a non-stock Android Verified Boot key which needs to be erased to fully revert back to a stock device state. After flashing the stock factory images and before locking the bootloader, you should erase the custom Android Verified Boot key to untrust it:
20:16:34 <atlas56> fastboot erase avb_custom_key
20:16:45 <atlas56> would this work?
20:17:02 <atlas56> https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
20:17:47 <mynacol[m]> atlas56: The problem is enabling developer options in grapheneos
20:18:29 <TheJollyRoger> Sam24: Remember that if your bootloader is locked, verified boot practically reinstalls GrapheneOS every time you reboot your phone (or your phone won't boot if it can't). If you want to start fresh and erase all your data, factory reset will destroy any data you've got.
20:19:10 <Sam24> how can i do the factory reset
20:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> Sam24: do you have all your data on that phone copied off of it? Nothing you don't want to lose?
20:20:58 <Sam24> yes
20:21:04 <Sam24> i have al the data
20:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. In the home screen, tap on "Settings"
20:21:25 <Sam24> i have found it
20:21:28 <TheJollyRoger> Scroll to the very bottom of the settings menu, and tap on "System"
20:21:59 <TheJollyRoger> Pop down the advanced tab and there should be "Reset Options" there, then "Erase All Data - Factory Reset"
20:22:15 <TheJollyRoger> That should get you a fresh start.
20:22:21 <Sam24> yes it s new reboten
20:22:21 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
20:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back shortly!
20:32:31 <Sam24> i still get Device state; locked
20:35:18 <mynacol[m]> Sam24: Have you enabled OEM Unlocking in the system?
20:35:23 <Sam24> yes
20:36:09 <mynacol[m]> Try `fastboot flashing unlock`
20:36:49 <isou> https://youtu.be/oO0UFZjuotg

21:11:29 <TheJollyRoger> Also, are you using fastboot version >=30?
21:11:30 <Sam24> i did nothing
21:11:53 <TheJollyRoger> You have to wait until fastboot tells you "Finished, press any key to exit."
21:12:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you disturb the phone before you get "Finished, press any key to exit" you're going to end up with an unbootable OS.

21:15:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Wait until the computer gives you "Finished, press any key to exit" before you relock the bootloader.
21:15:49 <TheJollyRoger> If you've already disturbed the phone before you got that message you're going to have an incomplete install and the phone will not boot.
21:16:12 <TheJollyRoger> If you did that, start the process again and let it run to completion.

21:17:07 <TheJollyRoger> Can you confirm, does it say PRESS ANY KEY TO EXIT?
21:17:34 <TheJollyRoger> (This is a yes or no answer. If it's anything but yes, leave it be)
21:20:46 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step away from the computer for a min.
21:24:25 <Sam24> nice its working
21:24:30 <Sam24> thanks a lot
21:24:47 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear you got it working!
21:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> Don't forget to re-lock the bootloader, that will finish the installation.
21:25:21 <Sam24> yes i did
21:25:28 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Welcome back aboard the ship, shipmate!
21:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, and as always... if you find GrapheneOS useful, please donate to the project at https://grapheneos.org/donate so that work on it can continue!
21:25:56 <Sam24> i will
21:25:57 <eglssm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "We are going to start testing fo"> You guys are awesome
21:26:06 <TheJollyRoger> Horay! Thank you!
21:26:14 <majorasparagus0[> Hi. I have had this thing lying around for a long time. Going to start using it now.
21:26:35 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome sauce!
21:26:37 <Sam24> it is not posibile to install on samsung devices
21:27:02 <TheJollyRoger> Sam24: no, unfortunately not. Samsung devices have a fuse that if you unlock the bootloader, the device will burn out a Knox E Fuse and permanently disable the bootloader security features.
21:27:10 <TheJollyRoger> Rendering the device permanently insecure.
21:27:21 <majorasparagus0[> I have a monthly github donation. So thankful for what you guys are doing
21:27:35 <TheJollyRoger> majorasparagus0[: Aw man, thank you, you rock!
21:28:19 <majorasparagus0[> Unless you're alphabet soup creating a honeypot with backdoors. But I'm not smart enough to be able to verify :)
21:28:21 <Sam24> i have to go
21:28:25 <Sam24> tmr to work
21:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> Fare thee well!
21:28:34 <Sam24> have nice evening
21:28:50 <TheJollyRoger> majorasparagus0[: hehehe, well, I'm not smart enough to verify either :P. But I trust the developers.
21:28:57 <Sam24> and stay safe
21:29:07 <TheJollyRoger> You too, shipmate. Take care of yourself in these troubled times.
21:29:21 <Sam24> thank¬† same to you
21:29:30 <majorasparagus0[> What is the preferred method of getting apps for graphene? F droid?
21:29:30 <Sam24> bye bye
21:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> majorasparagus0[: hehe, I just hit CTRL-F and search for "im_the_nsa_let_me_in{" and then go "Looks legit!" when I see zero results!
21:30:01 <majorasparagus0[> Hahaha
21:30:17 <majorasparagus0[> Never thought about that. Excellent hack.
21:30:18 <TheJollyRoger> Whoop! Hang on everybody, Matrix bridge is resetting!
21:30:55 <TheJollyRoger> Almost there...
21:31:17 <faxing[m]> <majorasparagus0[ "What is the preferred method of "> Yes.
21:31:43 <faxing[m]> Try to get apps from F-Droid and be aware of their "anti-features"(?) before installing.
21:32:07 <TheJollyRoger> majorasparagus0[: faxing[m] I actually suggest the Aurora store. The problem with F-Droid is that many of the apps on F-Droid target older versions of the Android API and significantly lag behind upstream, sometimes missing months of critical security patches.
21:33:23 <TheJollyRoger> If you can, try to find your apps from upstream, rather than relying on F-Droid. For instance, FairEmail publishes releases on their github and does a new release almost every day. Signal publishes a signed .apk file on their website (it's hidden, so you must search for it), which will-self-update and you can check the signing certificate on it if you're paranoid.
21:34:20 <majorasparagus0[> This is why I failed at adoption of the OS last year. Tough to get started for non-techie.
21:34:22 <majorasparagus0[> But worth it.
21:34:29 <majorasparagus0[> Convenience is a killer
21:34:53 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... it's a tad bit unfortunate but right now GrapheneOS doesn't have its own first-party application store with curated and secure applications, so unfortunately while F-Droid is not ideal, I recognize a lot of people will still likely be using it.
21:35:12 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
21:35:12 <majorasparagus0[> One step at a time.
21:35:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
21:37:34 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS follows standard Android security practices of trust-upon-first-use, so subsequent installations must be signed with the same certificate that signed the last, or signed the next. So either you can trust on first use, or if you have a known good version of the app, you can upgrade from that provided you follow the upgrade path that the developers intended you to (in case any of them
21:37:35 <TheJollyRoger> roll over their keys.)
21:38:11 <TheJollyRoger> *that signed the last, or validated the next by signing the last with both keys.
21:38:33 <AtlasShagged> TheJollyRoger Groovy info. Thx mate
21:38:42 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
21:40:19 <TheJollyRoger> This is also unfortunately why F-Droid sometimes is finicky: they sign their own apps. So unless the apps are built reproducibly and then F-Droid elects to use the developers' signatures and certificates, F-Droid also becomes a trusted third party or a man in the middle between you and the upstream developers.
21:42:51 <AtlasShagged> you have to ask yourself which apps are important.
21:43:06 <catfish[m]> TheJollyRoger is it any better for apps with their own repos like bromite and jitsi meet
21:43:10 <AtlasShagged> most oft the apps on my iphone i rarely use
21:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> catfish[m]: I think it would go a considerable way to reducing the problems with F-Droid if every upstream app did that, but at that rate, it would be easier if we just copied the model that Play Store uses, where each app developer signs and pushes their own apps.
21:46:07 <TheJollyRoger> I think the draw for a lot of people to F-Droid is that some people prefer to trust F-Droid more than they do upstream. I think this is mostly because of what I call "Toxic Power User mentality" though.
21:47:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, maybe "Self-Defeating Power User" would be a better way to describe it.
21:48:27 <catfish[m]> üòÇ must admit I have been that guy
21:50:50 <theOne[m]> > Ok. Wait until the computer gives you "Finished, press any key to exit" before you relock the bootloader.
21:50:50 <theOne[m]> Does this only apply to windows?
21:51:58 <theOne[m]> TheJollyRoger: see above quote.
21:59:01 <chris42> Hi there, read that you will starting to test the Pixel 5. Do you need help with that?
21:59:55 <TheJollyRoger> theOne[m]: Let me check... yep, it looks like it will only print Press Any Key To Exit on Windows.
22:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> I think I'm going to add that function to the Linux scripts then.
22:00:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a mo'
22:01:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hey chris42, the best person to ask about testing would be anupritaisno1[m]. You'll need to PM him directly.
22:04:25 * splidge[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/aSlAuDBDkKgmjnUvifIvwMBd/message.txt >
22:04:47 <TheJollyRoger> Very nice, splidge[m]!
22:04:53 <faxing[m]> <TheJollyRoger "majorasparagus0: faxing I actual"> Aurora is nice but you just get badgered back into Google's ecosystem.  On top of that, you miss out on many FOSS app alternatives that only publish to F-Droid and not the GPS. Also, apps targeting older versions of the API are the exception, not the rule, and most of them still work perfectly fine even if they do.
22:07:12 <splidge[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Very nice, splidge[m]!"> I think so too!! Graphene 4FR!
22:14:13 * justanotherlurke sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uxybhuPQwDBbgQDlorZOzWnk/message.txt >
22:21:16 <chris42> @TheJollyRoger: Ok, thanks will write him.
22:28:28 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: That's good to hear, but I still wish they'd do something about those other problems. Don't get me wrong, I do very much like the idea of a curated collection of secure and trustworthy open source apps, just, I don't think that F-droid is one at this point in time.
22:28:54 <TheJollyRoger> Still, you're right I am glad for its existence!
22:34:41 <r0tt0r[m]> <TheJollyRoger "faxing: That's good to hear, but"> but why not team up, audit the shit out of fdroid and make them close the gaps if any existing
22:37:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hey r0tt0r[m], that'd be ideal! Unfortunately, I don't know if relations between the two projects are good at this point in time.
22:38:55 <TheJollyRoger> I think at this point they're definitely pretty hostile, so I don't want to push that at the moment.
23:01:59 <AtlasShagged> hostility is love in an alternate universe
23:05:41 <Guest72> Hello hello:) ¬†Is it possible to use snapdrop with GrapheneOS?
23:10:42 <louipc> what is that
23:11:51 <Guest72> Its basically air drop but a web based version of it.
23:16:19 <Guest72> Iv tried to transfer files multiple times but it never goes through. It recognises my phone but it wont send the files. Does anyone have a solution to quickly transfer files to their computer wirelessly?
23:24:17 <justanotherlurke> <Guest72 "Iv tried to transfer files multi"> Bluetooth? WiFi direct? SSH? Brute force solution: attach to message to self?
