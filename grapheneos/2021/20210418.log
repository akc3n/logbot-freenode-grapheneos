00:12:07 <uyscuti23[m]> Hi everyone, just a quick (and probably daft) question. I‚Äôm new to this and just got a Pixel 5. I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs a good idea to backup the efs partition to avoid corruption before flashing a new os, is that necessary for GrapheneOS?
00:39:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy uyscuti23[m], it's not necessary when installing GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS is a full production operating system, and the web installer will take care of all the hard parts for you.
00:40:44 <TheJollyRoger> The only thing you need to worry about is not interfering with the bootloader, but the bootloader in a phone is signed, verified, and hard to wreck unless you try to do something like flash a 4a image onto a 4a5G handset or vice-versa. The web installer won't let you do this, so you're safe.
00:45:12 <uyscuti23[m]> Great, thank you very much I appreciate the help!
00:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! Anything else I might be able to answer for you while I'm at my desk?
00:46:30 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has a fully featured web installer, which reduces the installation (provided you have the correct hardware and software prerequisites) down to pressing a bunch of buttons on a website when prompted to... so doing weird stuff and flashing recoveries, etc, all that is not needed.
00:47:32 <TheJollyRoger> Since the root of trust is not the installing computer, but rather the remote attestation capabilities of your phone's hardware backed keystore and integrated security chip, this could even be done from a public access computer.
00:47:49 <TheJollyRoger> As long as you have a device that you trust to read the attestation data.
00:49:32 <uyscuti23[m]> I can't think of anything just now but thanks again! It seems fairly straightforward with the web installer, I had a go flashing Lineageos to an old Nexus 7 and that has led me here with my new Pixel üòÜ
00:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha, right on!
00:50:13 <TheJollyRoger> Well, welcome aboard the ship in advance!
00:52:05 <uyscuti23[m]> Thank you, it's good to be here and it's a truly great project. Amazing to think it can be installed through a web browser nowadays
00:52:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! Hehehe, it is! I was especially shocked to find out that it's even possible to install it on a Pixel from another Android phone o.O!
00:53:05 <TheJollyRoger> WebUSB has some absolutely amazing functionality.
00:54:26 <uyscuti23[m]> Absolutely!
01:12:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Deep (@N‚ÄãakedTendies) has joined the Telegram Group!
01:43:48 <GhostSplinterSix> Hello, all. How's everybody doing?
01:43:58 <grapheneos_user_> <GhostSplinterSix "Hello, all. How's everybody doin"> Great
01:44:16 <GhostSplinterSix> That's what I like to hear. üëçüèª
01:45:27 <GhostSplinterSix> I recently learned about GrapheneOS. It's definitely right up my alley.
01:46:02 <grapheneos_user_> Nice! GrapheneOS is definitely amazing
01:46:41 <GhostSplinterSix> Heck yes. I'm ready to degoogle.
02:13:58 <zvl12[m]> Hello.. I noticed since previous firmware update, my pixel 4a5g is MUCH more faster in between menus.... general feeling of all is quick without any delay
02:23:28 <GhostSplinterSix> Nice!
03:51:55 <strcat[m]> zvl12: unlikely that anything is actually faster
03:57:20 <bypassbobby[m]> Can anyone explain to me how using a secondary profile and deleting the profile is better than using the primary profile and just deleting the files?
04:04:40 <strcat[m]> the data is unrecoverable since hardware-based keys were deleted
04:04:55 <strcat[m]> data deleted off an SSD / HDD is not necessarily unrecoverable
04:15:34 <bypassbobby[m]> OK thanks for the info
05:07:21 <Zzzzzz> Hi everyone, is it possible to receive notifications from a secondary profile? I tried and it seems I can get alarm from the timer set in the second profile in the main profile, but I cannot get notifications from telegram installed in the second profile while in the main profile. Is this expected?
05:14:09 <curiousjoe[m]> Hi guys! A quick question should I go with Pixel 4 or 4a? 4 is $529 AUD and 4a is $569 AUD
05:14:20 <strcat[m]> curiousjoe: Pixel 4a, 4a (5G) or 5
05:14:27 <akc3n[m]> <Zzzzzz "Hi everyone, is it possible to r"> Might be something helpful on this issue here with your situation https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/522
05:14:28 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
05:15:59 <curiousjoe[m]> I've read the faq but it doesn't say how long those devices will be supported only that 4a will be supported longer. But I'm happy if the 4 is supported for like a year hence my question and also it doesn't make sense why the budget phone is more expensive
05:16:58 <Zzzzzz> akc3n[m]: Thanks, I don't think I have DND or battery save since I factory reset it just before, but let me double check
05:17:49 <strcat[m]> curiousjoe: about a year longer
05:17:56 <strcat[m]> at least that's guaranteed
05:18:10 <strcat[m]> 4a (5G) and 5 are the best devices to buy
05:18:17 <strcat[m]> the 4a recommendation will be dropped once the 5a is available
05:18:58 <curiousjoe[m]> Thanks strcat my budget doesn't allow me those models unfortunately
05:19:13 <akc3n[m]> Zzzzzz:  just a side note FYI, this is an excellent read about notifications on grapheneos:   https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
05:21:10 <Zzzzzz> akc3n[m]: Yeah, thanks! I've read it before, and it didn't talk about notification from another profile.
05:21:32 <curiousjoe[m]> So from what I understand GrapheneOS end of life is the same as Google end of life for support? If that's the case if I get Pixel 4 support will end next year and 4a support in 2023
05:23:50 <Zzzzzz> I just checked and I can get Telegram notifications when I'm in the second profile, just not when I am in the main profile. And I can get them again once I switch back to the second profile.
05:24:52 <akc3n[m]> Zzzzzz: ohhh, I may have misunderstood your initial inquiry. Are you asking if you can get notifications from an app that's in a secondary profile, while your in the owner profile?
05:25:29 <Zzzzzz> Yeah! That's the one thing that I really need to use grapheneos as my main phone.
05:26:47 <Zzzzzz> Telegram notification -- doesn't work this way, alarm -- works. I feel this is weird
05:30:05 <akc3n[m]> Zzzzzz: maybe have a look at https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
05:30:05 <akc3n[m]>   
05:30:05 <akc3n[m]> > The owner profile does not have access to the data in other profiles
05:32:19 <akc3n[m]> Zzzzzz:  honestly, I'm not qualified to answer your question, I only use the owner profile for remote auditor app.
05:32:47 <akc3n[m]> I apologize for misunderstanding your question.
05:34:35 <Zzzzzz> akc3n[m]: encryption -- Yeah that's what I don't get. It seems main profile is always on, but does changing back to main profile kill the second profile? If so, how was I able receive my alarm from my second profile...? But if the second profile is still active, why doesn't telegram work?
05:34:56 <Zzzzzz> oh no worries, I appreciate someone answering my question :P
05:36:19 <Zzzzzz> ... hmmm, on second thought, the alarm wasn't really a notification but a full-screen display...
05:37:42 <strcat[m]> covered in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
05:37:44 <strcat[m]> please read that
05:37:54 <strcat[m]> using "end session" kills the session
05:37:58 <strcat[m]> that's why that exists
05:38:09 <strcat[m]> if you don't do that then it keeps running up to the limit on the number of active profiles
05:41:01 <Zzzzzz> > if you don't do that then it keeps running up to the limit on the number of active profiles
05:41:01 <Zzzzzz> Thanks strcat! This is what I was looking for. I don't think the FAQ is updated with this information.
05:41:24 <Zzzzzz> But then this probably means I can't get notification from the second profile even if it is still active...
05:46:13 <Zzzzzz> but alarm does work, hmm... off topic but I wonder if it is possible to use an app to forward notifications of a second profile using alarms lol
05:58:38 <mark4o> Are https://www.instagram.com/grapheneos/ and https://www.facebook.com/GrapheneOS actually official GrapheneOS pages or are they imposters?
06:00:16 <sphinx[m]> mark4o: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/de602a2d676c1d308a9a526adcddbd20d61f324a
06:02:33 <mark4o> Ok so I guess they are new official pages, thanks.
06:10:41 <sphinx[m]> I guess it's for preventing impersonation like what happened with Linkedin and https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200807#c4673023
06:12:11 <mark4o> Ok that makes sense.
07:10:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Does wireless charging work with graphene on pixel 5
07:33:13 <akc3n> @lp4678 yes.
07:40:00 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Is there a way to back up everything(apps, files, settings, settings of apps) from GOS and use it on another phone that has graphene installed?
07:40:56 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Basically to move between models of Pixel without losing stuff.
07:45:49 <arcibald[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> https://github.com/Graph"> As I can see, there is way to make it esim works on GrapheneOS (download/install it on factory rom, then flash GrapheneOS). My question is - is this on any way some possible security flag/problem?
07:47:14 <sphinx[m]> Rahoon GOAWAY: With Seedvault, in Settings -> System -> Backup. But it can only back up the owner profile and can't back up the profile's home directory, i.e files and stuff that you see in the file manager.
07:49:47 <sphinx[m]> * Rahoon GOAWAY: With Seedvault, in Settings -> System -> Backup. But currently it can only back up the owner profile and can't back up the profile's home directory, i.e files and stuff that you see in the file manager.
07:51:25 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> The home directory is the Dewclaws, Documents,  Music, DCIM and all that right? That I can copy to a PC and move over.
07:52:18 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> So Seedvault will make a note of what apps I have, what their setting are, and allow me to put it on a different phone also?
07:52:40 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> * The home directory is the Downloads, Documents,  Music, DCIM and all that right? That I can copy to a PC and move over.
07:53:54 <akc3n[m]> Rahoon GOAWAY:   https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
07:56:19 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> ah ok thank you very much
07:56:43 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> I should have looked it up mysefl, sorry to bother
09:11:31 <covid-1984[m]> "Restoring app data will fail if its attempted on a different build of the app, with a different signature" -> is this true for build of OS too? And what does this mean in the case of no apps being installed (restoring onto a fresh OS)?
09:11:32 <covid-1984[m]> How is it possible to see 12GB of output like "BackupManagerService: File in shared storage..." But see nothing in any of the storage locations on the pixel 4a?
09:11:32 <covid-1984[m]> How is it possible to use flash drive backup/restore when the backup is more than 4GB?
09:22:53 <dazinism> People successfully use seedvault to move from one OS with it built in, to a different OS with seedvault
09:23:15 <dazinism> Seedvault backups are made up of lots of files
09:24:16 <dazinism> You don't get any files that are 4gb
09:31:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> With regards to the auditor app, how do you know where there is a problem? So if you install a dodgy app, will the auditor app detect this? And how will I know if there's a problem
09:36:28 <dazinism> The things it cam detect are if theres an app enabled as an 'accessibility service' or a 'device manager'
09:37:13 <dazinism> Its advised not to grant these to any apps, unless you absolutely have to
09:38:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <<‚ú≠·¥Ñ ∏·µá·µâ ≥…¢ ∞·µíÀ¢·µó‚ú≠>> (@c‚Äãyberghostindark) has joined the Telegram Group!
09:39:33 <dazinism> Once you have done an auditor pairing, further audits with that device give a very strong guarantee that you are running an unaltered OS
09:40:23 <dazinism> As far as dodgy apps go. Need to be careful what you install and what permissions / 'special access' you grant apps
09:41:19 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
09:41:51 <dazinism> *further audits with the paired device
09:52:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> How do you know if an app has special or accessibility permissions granted ? Where do you locate this
09:57:30 <dazinism> Accessibility services are the most tricky as once granted, an app has the power to change what you see on the screen (so can hide that you have it enabled)
09:57:34 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Accessibility_services
09:58:05 <dazinism> Using Auditor is a reliable way to look
10:03:15 <dazinism> Other stuff is in Settings > Apps > Advanced > Special app access
10:06:13 <dazinism> Best not to remove any of those from system apps as it can seriously break the OS
10:20:11 <covid-1984[m]> dazinism:  I backed up the pixel 3a using adb. Now that pixel 3a doesn't work anymore. When trying to restore using adb restore, I see all the files are copied to the pixel 4 - but absolutely nothing shows up on it when done. And I can't find any details about why.
10:20:39 <covid-1984[m]> I'm wishing I had used seed vault, but I saw Daniels post that they're basically the same... And I didn't have an adapter for the flash drive at the time.[
10:22:24 <covid-1984[m]> For example, the restoration process shows many APKs being installed - but I end up seeing zero new apps on the phone after restore.
10:29:32 <dazinism> covid-1984: been a while since I've done an adb restore, but think I always had to install the apps manually before running the restore for it to work
10:30:10 <covid-1984[m]> But the gallery app is defaultly installed
10:30:17 <covid-1984[m]> And I restored at least 4GB of files into it
10:30:22 <covid-1984[m]> and see nothing on the device
10:30:38 <covid-1984[m]> logcat shows the videos/pics being restored, for example.
10:31:01 <dazinism> Don't think gallery has files? It just displays whats in shared storage?
10:31:02 <covid-1984[m]> BackupManagerService: [UserID:0] adb restore processing complete. BackupManagerService: Full restore pass complete.
10:31:19 <covid-1984[m]> Right, I'm saying I restored 12GB into shared stored
10:31:20 <covid-1984[m]> storage*
10:31:31 <covid-1984[m]> And I see zero changes to the filesystem on the pixel
10:31:37 <dazinism> Not with adb restore you didn't
10:32:06 <dazinism> Need to use adb pull and adb push for that
10:32:08 <covid-1984[m]> logcat outputs during adb restore: "BackupManagerService: File in shared storage"
10:32:24 <covid-1984[m]> So that didn't go to shared storage?
10:32:35 <dazinism> Or just plug the device in and use the PC file explorer/manager
10:33:29 <dazinism> (May have to grant permission from notification on phone - while since I done that also)
10:33:46 <covid-1984[m]> Yes I did that each time and watched the restore happen on the phone
10:33:49 <covid-1984[m]> to zero affect
10:34:00 <covid-1984[m]> So what's this about adb pull & push?
10:34:09 <covid-1984[m]> restore & then push?
10:34:18 <dazinism> adb backup doesn't backup shared storage
10:35:01 <dazinism> So adb restore can not restore it
10:35:07 <covid-1984[m]> Well I have a 12GB backup.ab file... so whatever storage that is I have something to restore
10:35:10 <dazinism> Not sure what you are seeing
10:35:30 <dazinism> That is the internal private app data
10:35:49 <dazinism> That you can't see with the GrapheneOS file manager
10:36:02 <covid-1984[m]> But I literally see the videos & images being restored from it in logcat
10:36:15 <covid-1984[m]> Those were visible in file manager and gallery
10:36:22 <covid-1984[m]> Both of those apps are installed
10:36:32 <covid-1984[m]> But nothing from the restore is shown
10:36:39 <covid-1984[m]> Makes no sense at all
10:36:53 <covid-1984[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups I followed this guide to the tee
10:37:58 <dazinism> <covid-1984[m] "But I literally see the videos &"> I don't think you are seeing what you think you are seeing
10:38:27 <dazinism> I'm not certain. But maybe those apps keep thumbnails of your images/videos?
10:39:47 <covid-1984[m]> So the process is 1) figure out what happens I had installed 2) install them 3) adb restore 4) copy stuff back into shared storage by way of mounting / file manager ??
10:39:59 <covid-1984[m]> what apps*
10:40:24 <dazinism> You need to get the files in shared storage off the old device
10:40:38 <covid-1984[m]> By mounting and copying?
10:40:40 <dazinism> Adb backup doesn't do that
10:41:41 <mdshaheen227[m]> Is it possible for install this OS in samsung s9+? Please help me
10:41:51 <covid-1984[m]> mdshaheen227:  nope
10:42:40 <mdshaheen227[m]> Is this os only for google pixel? COVID-1984
10:42:54 <covid-1984[m]> mdshaheen227: supported hardware is on the website
10:44:47 <dazinism> covid-1984: if you have usb debugging enabled I think it may possibly interfere with the standard functionality
10:44:55 <covid-1984[m]> So even though logcat shows the APKs as being installed, they aren't really and we must install them all manually again?
10:44:55 <dazinism> Generally if you plug your unlocked phone into a PC you should see the shared storage on the phone  it as an external drive
10:44:57 <dazinism> May have to confirm you want to do that with a notification on the phone. I forget
10:45:10 <covid-1984[m]> yes it is enabled of course to use adb restore
10:45:26 <covid-1984[m]> ya got that part
10:45:35 <covid-1984[m]> What doesn't make sense is logcat showing APKs being installed from the backup.ab
10:45:51 <dazinism> Can you see the apps on the phone?
10:46:04 <covid-1984[m]> Or how I can figure out which apps I had installed before... I suppose I must guess, and then do adb restore... and just hope I got most of it
10:46:18 <covid-1984[m]> dazinism: I see *ZERO* changes to the phone after adb restore (12GB restore)
10:46:27 <covid-1984[m]> It is a fresh install
10:51:09 <dazinism> covid-1984: adb shell pm list packages
10:51:31 <dazinism> Maybe they are on the phone, just not installed on the user
10:52:13 <covid-1984[m]> And how would one "install them on the user"?
10:52:28 <covid-1984[m]> The phone they're migrating from was on the main user, same with the new phone.
10:53:33 <covid-1984[m]> <dazinism "covid-1984: adb shell pm list pa"> Must be used on the device being migrated from? It is broken... Which is why I'm restoring from backups
10:55:32 <dazinism> No it'll let you know what apps are available on the device you ran the restore on
10:56:49 <dazinism> Theres a chance the apps could be 'installed' on the device, just not 'installed' in any user
10:57:43 <covid-1984[m]> And what do I do in that case?
10:58:49 <covid-1984[m]> 'adb shell pm list packages' shows a lot... Just nothing from the old phone though
11:02:19 <dazinism> I guess they weren't restored then. As I said before I've only had it work when I've installed the apps manually before running adb restore
11:03:23 <dazinism> Whats the deal with the old device? Broken?
11:03:26 <covid-1984[m]> Can you run adb restore on the same phone more than once without messing it up?
11:03:34 <dazinism> Yes
11:03:37 <covid-1984[m]> old device in infinite boot cycle
11:03:53 <covid-1984[m]> It has zero issues... Just one day stopped booting
11:03:58 <covid-1984[m]> issues physically I mean
11:04:19 <covid-1984[m]> I backed it up weekly, which is why this restoration process is so disappointing
11:04:21 <dazinism> Can get files from shared storage using adb pull
11:04:29 <covid-1984[m]> before it boots?
11:04:34 <covid-1984[m]> dont think so
11:04:42 <dazinism> Yeah, maybe not
11:05:08 <dazinism> But then I goes adb backup also.wouldn't work from there
11:05:53 <dazinism> You have a backup from before the phone was doing that?
11:06:16 <covid-1984[m]> yes but I've not been able to restore it yet after 5 attempts so far
11:06:32 <covid-1984[m]> I guess I'll try to manually install all apps now
11:07:21 <rny[m]> covid-1984: werent you banned previously?
11:07:24 <covid-1984[m]> It would be nice to know what is happening when logcat shows "installing APK"
11:07:51 <covid-1984[m]> rny:  someone else asked me that... maybe I shouldn't use a name that is a meme
11:12:16 <covid-1984[m]> strcat: is dazinism right in saying these adb restored packages (logcat shows "installing APK") that seem to go into the abyss... Could be getting installed into another user or something?
11:12:40 <strcat[m]> I think adb backup/restore is only for owner atm
11:12:44 <strcat[m]> it used to have more functionality
11:12:45 <strcat[m]> was removed
11:12:52 <strcat[m]> is being removed as a whole, meant to use backup services now
11:12:58 <strcat[m]> stock OS has the device-to-device transfer service
11:13:01 <covid-1984[m]> Ok, so this is a backup from pixel 3a (owner) -> pixel 4a (owner)
11:13:31 <strcat[m]> it's possible the issue is that most of the OS apps have different signing keys? don't know if it enforces that for those
11:13:44 <covid-1984[m]> maybe I can convert the backup.ab to a seedvault backup? I can't just copy it to a flash drive because it is 12GB (and fat32 only does 4gb files)
11:13:45 <strcat[m]> it does enforce that for random apps
11:13:56 <strcat[m]> the OS apps have diff signing keys so it probably won't restore across diff devices
11:14:03 <strcat[m]> unsure what Seedvault does offhand
11:14:35 <covid-1984[m]> Just at a loss for clues because it is a 12gb backup that has zero effect on a fresh install to a pixel 4a (and logcat shows it is successfully restored)
11:14:57 <covid-1984[m]> Next I'm trying to install all apps manually as dazinism suggested and restore again
11:15:26 <covid-1984[m]> But I expected the gallery app (defaultly installed) to show some sign a restore has happened
11:16:06 <strcat[m]> has different signature on both
11:16:15 <strcat[m]> adb backup sucks
11:16:40 <covid-1984[m]> Does that mean there is a possible way to get this data back? The device it was from is broken
11:16:47 <strcat[m]> you should just decrypt the adb backup on the computer
11:16:57 <strcat[m]> if you want you can manually change the signing keys in it
11:17:01 <strcat[m]> to make it willing to restore
11:18:01 <covid-1984[m]> Any idea how much adb backup saves that just copying the directories when mounting the FS doesn't?
11:18:53 <covid-1984[m]> <strcat[m] "if you want you can manually cha"> I think the adb backup is already not encrypted. However, I don't know how to find the right keys and replace them.
11:19:09 <hwz588[m]> Heyüëã
11:19:36 <GhostSplinterSix> Good morning, friends.
11:24:24 <hatedone> hi there im a new bie is there a way of installing graphen os on other phones like pixel.. I myself would love to use it on my OnePlus 6T. I know how too root it but im not sure if i can install grapehn os?
11:25:30 <covid-1984[m]> hatedone: reasons not are on the official website
11:26:37 <Pratyush[m]> in short no only pixel devices is supported  https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
11:27:00 <GhostSplinterSix> ^
11:28:11 <hatedone> okay.. thats bad for me haha i guess i have to sell my device and get a pixel if i want to use it... thank you anyway for your help
11:29:51 <GhostSplinterSix> I have a Note 20 Ultra and use a Pixel 4a with GrapheneOS.
11:30:42 <hatedone> so you juse tow devices ? what are the resons for you to not switch compleately?
11:31:28 <Pratyush[m]> hatedone:   #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
11:32:54 <GhostSplinterSix> <hatedone "so you juse tow devices ? what a"> Because I bought the Note20 Ultra a month ago before I had learned about GrapheneOS üòÜ
11:33:02 <akc3n[m]> <covid-1984[m] "hatedone: reasons not are on the"> That's inaccurate. Reasons is clearly stated in the FAQ.
11:33:27 <covid-1984[m]> Ya grapheneos is the official graphene website...
11:34:40 <covid-1984[m]> Any idea where to find the keys by which to replace in the backup.ab, as strcat described?
11:35:14 <akc3n[m]> <hatedone "hi there im a new bie is there a"> Rooting destroys androids security model.

11:35:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Either way, clarifications are welcome
11:36:31 <akc3n[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "> <@akc3n:tchncs.de> That's inac"> Ohhh... Thanks for clarifying.
11:37:34 <covid-1984[m]> right
11:38:24 <akc3n[m]> <covid-1984[m] "right"> Sorry about that.
11:39:16 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <covid-1984[m] "right"> Seedvault uses the same internal API as adb backup, you might want to check the seedvault decryption tool here
11:39:49 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No guarantees it'll work, just basing it on the description of seedvault app at https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault
11:40:04 <covid-1984[m]> For how to change the keys to get a restore to work? Hmmm... Now I'm thinking I might save hours if I know the difference between a full 'adb backup' and 'just copying all directories off of a pixel when mounted'
11:40:30 <covid-1984[m]> And just restore by copying those directories onto the device after manually re-installing all the apps
11:40:56 <covid-1984[m]> But maybe adb backup has stuff that isn't included in that... I don't know
12:01:20 <r0tt0r[m]> seedvault does not include certain data, i test that
12:02:23 <covid-1984[m]> r0tt0r: I'm kind of asking the opposite, if adb backup has anything that just copying all folders off of device doesn't.
12:03:30 <r0tt0r[m]> <covid-1984[m] "r0tt0r: I'm kind of asking the o"> ye that wont work due certain data is residing on non accessible area
12:04:02 <r0tt0r[m]> fe netflix, my vpn app and others used that
12:04:26 <covid-1984[m]> OK, I'm trying to make an actual restore process out of this info so far. 1) fresh install 2) install all apps manually 3) adb restore 4) copy over files by mounting
12:04:34 <covid-1984[m]> How does that look?
12:06:38 <r0tt0r[m]> <covid-1984[m] "How does that look?"> try though some dont work depending on app, i miss full twrp backup but i accomodated to backup internal store / pictures mainly most important
12:07:10 <r0tt0r[m]> since using graphene i wont switch rom anymore, couldnt be more happy with it
12:16:31 <dazinism> covid-1984: yes thats the way. Adb backup doesn't get files from shared storage (what you can see from files app) it gets the private data from apps
12:17:04 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/storage
12:19:03 <dazinism> Actually to confuse things a bit, I think adb backup gets the apps files that you can see from file manager under the android directory.
12:19:20 <dazinism> Don't think anything else though
12:19:49 <dazinism> * Actually to confuse things a bit, I think adb backup gets the apps files that you can see from file manager under the Android/ directory.
12:23:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Nixda (@N‚Äãixda23) has joined the Telegram Group!
12:25:29 <M3useb1usasd[m]> Was there an update today? Can't see it on the website but I have a message from "seamless update client"  saying "update successfully installed - please reboot the device to run the latest OS"
12:27:07 <dazinism> 3useb1usasd: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.04.16.04
12:30:04 <M3useb1usasd[m]> <dazinism "3useb1usasd: https://grapheneos."> üôè
12:37:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> Question about new "enable support for native debugging toggle" feature:Does this help GrapheneOS itself with automatic error reporting or is it only for reporting manual bugs?
12:38:58 <covid-1984[m]> <dazinism "covid-1984: yes thats the way. A"> Thanks... Maybe the process should be added somewhere because it did take me a few days to figure out and I'm not done yet.
12:39:16 <covid-1984[m]> I guess people can google for matrix chat history? not sure
12:41:14 <missfire[m]> hey, (thanks for the amazing os! etc) is it possible to record calls?
12:53:23 <dazinism> covid-1984: theres quite a few things to consider if you want to back stuff up
12:53:23 <dazinism> Theres different places that different types of data are held. It can all be a bit confusing.
12:53:34 <dazinism>  Why I made that wiki page
12:54:16 <akc3n[m]> <missfire[m] "hey, (thanks for the amazing os!"> I know personally, using csipsimple, their is an option to record calls. However I don't think tha exists with androids built in sip?  And the legality aspect of it I believe may play a factor in different nations perhaps.
12:54:18 <dazinism>  Seedvault can make things easier - although it also doesn't get everything,
12:55:36 <akc3n[m]> * I know personally from using csipsimple, there is an option to record calls. However I don't think that exists with androids built in sip?  And the legality aspect of it, I believe may play a factor in different nations perhaps.
12:55:36 <akc3n[m]> BTW, this maybe an offtopic subject in accordance with rooms 2a rule.
12:55:36 <akc3n[m]> Check out #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
12:56:02 <covid-1984[m]> What would be extremely useful is a process that does get everything within a certain bound. Fine if it says "this doesn't get X Y & Z, but gets everything else"
12:58:08 <covid-1984[m]> And of course a tested process for restoration. I'm currently working on the above one: 1) install all apps manually 2) adb restore 3) mount and copy all files over that were originally copied off via mounting
12:58:14 <dazinism> Seedvault gets most stuff -  except for files in shared storage (which most likely includes your photos/videos)
12:58:40 <covid-1984[m]> All stuff in shared storage can be copied by mounting filesystem, right?
12:58:52 <covid-1984[m]> So the above process would cover that?
12:58:54 <dazinism> Yeah
12:59:05 <covid-1984[m]> Plus I saw a post from Daniel saying adb backup covers everything that seedvault covers
12:59:12 <covid-1984[m]> Maybe something has changed since then
12:59:54 <dazinism> Not sure if adb backup gets SMS, phone logs, locally stored contacts
13:00:08 <dazinism> Seedvault does
13:04:43 <covid-1984[m]> dazinism:  Does seedvault store to shared storage when backing up locally?
13:04:52 <covid-1984[m]> like if you do seedvault backup without flash drive
13:05:11 <dazinism> Yeah. Its hidden though
13:05:26 <dazinism> You can get file manager to show it
13:05:31 <covid-1984[m]> What dir?
13:05:53 <dazinism> In the main/root directory
13:06:07 <dazinism> Of storage
13:06:19 <covid-1984[m]> Don't think I see it... What would it be called?
13:06:21 <dazinism> If you are looking with the file manager app
13:06:41 <dazinism> Its hidden have to get file manager to show hidden files
13:06:49 <covid-1984[m]> yes I listed all hidden files
13:06:58 <dazinism> Its
13:07:10 <dazinism> .seedvault
13:07:19 <dazinism> Or something like that
13:07:32 <dazinism> Has a .  at the beginning
13:09:19 <covid-1984[m]> ok found it... 100megs
13:09:25 <covid-1984[m]> :(
13:09:42 <covid-1984[m]> adb backup is 12GB. copying all directories off is 30gb
13:11:52 <timeobo[m]> I got a question about a option in development settings that got removed the option called "mock location app"
13:12:25 <timeobo[m]> Is there way for me to get it back?
13:12:47 <covid-1984[m]> dazinism: well I'm gonna try it... So if I copy that .SeedVaultAndroidBackup dir to a flash drive, then it'll see it during a fresh install?
13:17:01 <timeobo[m]> <timeobo[m] "I got a question about a option "> Nevermind i found it
13:17:28 <timeobo[m]> My mistake.. üòí
13:20:56 <TheLynx> Hello everybody, just insatlled the newes upgrade for my Pixel 3a and haven some issues with a 2FA App for my Creditcard. The issue started reproducible right after the update. Not sure if this has someting to do with "Vanadium: disable speculative service worker start by default"
13:21:17 <TheLynx> That is the link to the app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.fiduciagad.securego.vr
13:21:39 <TheLynx> Someone has similar issues?
13:25:24 <covid-1984[m]> dazinism: my description for seedvault dir worked :)
13:26:24 <covid-1984[m]> Is there a way to get seedvault to include all of that data from shared storage (seems to be 98% of the data in my case)?
13:27:13 <covid-1984[m]> Or else I need to make a process for 1) backup with seedvault 2) backup all shared storage with syncthing (or similar)
13:31:58 <dazinism> covid-1984: yeah, seedvault and syncthing would work. Or manually transfer files from shared storage.
13:32:30 <dazinism> The work for seedvault to backup shared storage is being done
13:32:38 <dazinism> Been underway for a while
13:32:44 <dazinism> Not sure of current status
13:32:51 <covid-1984[m]> Their goal is complete backup of everything?
13:36:46 <bluecream[m]> I noticed that graphene is able to connect to wifi right after restart, when the device is still locked. (Dont know about other network), do you think this could be disabled, as i would consider wifi login data as personally identifying information.
13:36:46 <bluecream[m]> I know it would interfer with the updater, but is it really worth it?
13:37:30 <dazinism> covid-1984: yeah, as much as possible. Theres issues with some apps. You have to run the backup / export functionality in the app
13:37:42 <dazinism> As the data is encrypted to the device
13:41:03 <covid-1984[m]> Cool. The only one I care about that says "app didn't allow backup" is FairEmail
13:41:16 <covid-1984[m]> WhatsApp too, but that's 100% WhatsApps fault for being insane
13:41:52 <covid-1984[m]> I guess DAVx‚Åµ too
13:43:17 <covid-1984[m]> dazinism: interesting that the adb restore db is 12gb and the seedvault was 1gb.
13:48:23 <strcat[m]> covid-1984: seedvault doesn't include the home directory atm
13:54:53 <covid-1984[m]> Is 'shared storage' a super set of the home dir?
14:06:52 <strcat[m]> no
14:06:52 <strcat[m]> same thing
14:07:16 <strcat[m]> the actual Android name for it is 'external storage' as in 'outside of internal app storage'
14:07:41 <strcat[m]> but I don't call it that for users because it sounds like talking about an external drive
14:08:11 <strcat[m]> shared storage isn't a very good name for it anymore since apps being able to request bulk access to it is largely going away
14:08:24 <strcat[m]> should choose an official term to use for GrapheneOS to refer to it
14:08:37 <dazinism> Yeah it can get confusing. Also sometimes gets called other things for various reasons that make sense (or made sense at some time for android devices)
14:10:28 <dazinism> Like if you are looking via adb its /storage/emulated/0 for the main users storage
14:10:57 <dazinism> Also confusingly sometimes gets called usb storage
14:12:20 <dazinism> If I'm not getting confused because it used to be available at storage/usb/....
14:14:02 <covid-1984[m]> ok good to know. I also notice when mounting the pixel 4a, it mounts as: /mnt/Pixel/'Internal shared storage'/
14:14:30 <bizanon[m]> are all apps being sandboxed a unique feature of GOS ? or all androids have this?
14:15:49 <strcat[m]> it's standard but the strength of the sandbox varies a lot
14:16:06 <strcat[m]> AOSP 11 with proper security updates is a good baseline
14:16:13 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS provides a much stronger and stricter sandbox
14:16:26 <strcat[m]> most OSes based on AOSP drastically reduce the security
14:16:38 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS does the opposite
14:18:08 <bizanon[m]> if an app is installed on a regular phone, and reinstalled, they can know that it is being installed on the same device.
14:18:08 <bizanon[m]> But with graphene, when I install the same app in two different profiles, the app thinks its a separate phone
14:20:10 <dummyaccountthat> Heyhey, i already asked yesterday, but got no answer. Hipe it is ok to ask again:
14:20:10 <dummyaccountthat> Im searching a mdm to manage several grapheneos phones. I tried relution, but its buggy and i dont like that it isnt self hosted or open source.
14:20:10 <dummyaccountthat> Does anyone have experience with managing/deploying grapheneos with a mobile devices managent software?

14:36:42 <dummyaccountthat> <timeobo[m] "Accessing my two phones"> How do you access the phones? Via usb and adb?
14:58:37 <Zzzzzz> Hi all, just to report back about the idea yesterday of forwarding notifications from another user profile. It seems notification listeners like IFTTT can't get notifications from the second profile if the profile is in the background (but still active) either, although when I switch back to that profile the notification is there. I'm out of luck
15:30:20 <dazinism> Zzzzzz: I was wondering if something that had access to notifications could be used in some way.
15:30:37 <dazinism> Had access to notifications in the secondary profile
15:31:33 <dazinism> Each profile is separate and an app can't get access to notifications in another profile
15:31:53 <dazinism> Oh, they quit....
15:33:17 <dazinism> dummyaccountthatwillpropablybedeletedanyway: I think pretty much all MDM apps use Google Play push services to take commands from a remote manager
15:33:42 <dazinism> Would be interesting if someone found one that didn't
15:34:30 <dazinism> Because of that it's likely to be problematic / hard to remote manage devices
15:35:44 <dazinism> Guess it might work if you use something like Easer to launch the MDM app on a schedule
15:36:45 <dazinism> Be ready to do the remote management when the app is scheduled to start.
15:54:21 <missfire[m]> having problem with gps, using openstreetmaps (OsmAnd+) and location can't be determined
15:57:09 <strcat[m]> use SatStat to check that it's working properly
15:57:21 <strcat[m]> miss fire: are you outside and waiting long enough?
15:57:29 <strcat[m]> app has location permission + location is toggled on globally?
15:57:51 <missfire[m]> yes, yes and yes
15:57:52 <strcat[m]> also if you only give it foreground permission then it can't keep getting a lock in the background
16:00:24 <missfire[m]> ok, it suddenly started working
16:00:43 <missfire[m]> hope it will stay that way
16:00:46 <louipc> maybe u just had to get the sat signal

16:18:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> but it looks like the grapheneos website evolved
16:18:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> and im stuck
16:18:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> could anyone provide a bit of help
16:18:34 <interesting[m]> is eSIM implementation still in works?

16:19:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> lol
16:20:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> i thought it was not but since i m stuck ... i went up to the step of the unlock boatlodder but @honorablepee  if i manage once it s your time to do i ll be able to help
16:20:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> i have to say the website is really well done
16:20:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãonorablepee> Definitely, I‚Äôll pm you once I buy the device on Monday
16:20:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> i must be really dumb
16:22:01 <helloworldkk87[m> Easy if you just follow the official web install guide
16:22:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> helloworldkk87 i m doing it and actually it s somethign i ve done successfully in the past
16:23:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> but i should have written down all the steps with my own words (plus english is my second language)
16:23:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> also i think the website changed a bit i m stuck because i don t see a button flashing release anywhere
16:24:13 <helloworldkk87[m> CLI or web install?
16:24:15 <Jenna2649> Hey guys, does LTE use more power than 3G? Id like to see a 3G only mode added
16:24:37 <Jenna2649> 3G only, to prevent 2G downgrade attacks
16:24:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> helloworldkk87 weirdly enought it was said web isntall was easier but i did not figure out hwo to do
16:24:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> so im doing with the terminal
16:24:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> copy pasting command lines
16:25:17 <helloworldkk87[m> <Jenna2649 "Hey guys, does LTE use more powe"> The point of LTE only mode is to decrease attack surface. Its not there to make it secure or to be battery friendly
16:25:54 <helloworldkk87[m> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Romain> so im doing with the t"> Well if the web install wont work the CLI wont either
16:26:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> helloworldkk87 thanks so i m gonna retry from scratch web install re read everything
16:26:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> i was optimisitic as i managed to unlock the bootloader
16:27:38 <helloworldkk87[m> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Romain> helloworldkk87 thanks "> Yeah you cant skip a single word in there:D everything is there for a reason
16:28:01 <Jenna2649> nice
16:28:16 <Jenna2649> well i think 3g only would be cool too
16:28:34 <Jenna2649> the primary imsi catchers work by sending a phone to 2G mode
16:28:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> helloworldkk87 I think i found out @honorablepee  so pm me next monday i ll help you !
16:28:46 <Jenna2649> so 3g only would also reduce attack surface
16:29:26 <Jenna2649> would probably be easy to add
16:29:55 <Jenna2649> LTE/3G only would be good too, avoiding 2G is the goal
16:30:29 <Jenna2649> lte only, 3G/Lte only, and 3g only would be really nice features.
16:35:03 <helloworldkk87[m> The point of it is to remove legacy code, and 3G is part of that
16:37:51 <hiroshi[m]> Hello folks. is there any option to enable logs or output when seamless update client is running ?

Also dont use USB hubs or stuff like that. Also you cant be on incognito mode and you should use chromium as it supports WebUSB unlike ff. Ps. Your browser, phone and computer all needs to be up-to-date
16:52:01 <GhostSplinterSix> Hello, all. I saw that GrapheneOS doesn't work on the Sprint network. With T-Mobile now owning Sprint, does anyone know if the OS works on the T-Mobile network?
16:52:36 <Babbot45> please add : LTE / 3G only mode
16:52:47 <Babbot45> and 3G only mode
16:53:08 <somenerd[m]> I think that LTE only mode's already added
16:53:13 <Babbot45> yes
16:53:21 <helloworldkk87[m> <somenerd[m] "I think that LTE only mode's alr"> ^
16:53:35 <somenerd[m]> also, don't think that 3G only mode is relevant to GrapheneOS
16:53:39 <bluecream[m]> <Babbot45 "and 3G only mode"> But actually why 3g, is coverage that bad over there?
16:53:52 <Babbot45> requesting lte and 3g only mode, some places have spotty lte
16:54:20 <Babbot45> LTE/3G only mode, and 3G only mode
16:54:29 <helloworldkk87[m> That doesnt have to do with security/privacy
16:54:30 <somenerd[m]> LTE only mode's already added, and I'm not sure if 3g only mode is relevant to GrapheneOS
16:54:44 <somenerd[m]> > That doesnt have to do with security/privacy
16:54:45 <somenerd[m]> ^
16:55:01 <Babbot45> its a feature request¬† it would probably be easy to add in
16:55:03 <somenerd[m]> but you can go onto the os issue tracker if you think that it is relevant
16:55:40 <Babbot45> i prefer 3G to lte because i think 3G uses less power
16:55:52 <Babbot45> and 3G is more secure than 2G
16:56:14 <helloworldkk87[m> <Babbot45 "i prefer 3G to lte because i thi"> Again, has nothing to do with security:D
16:56:26 <Babbot45> yes it does
16:56:45 <Babbot45> basically just 2g should be avoided due to no tower autgentication
16:57:02 <Babbot45> 3g and lte should be used only
16:57:18 <somenerd[m]> Networks should be distrusted
16:57:20 <Babbot45> some places dont have lte
16:57:24 <Babbot45> yeah i knoe
16:57:36 <somenerd[m]> LTE only mode is for attack surface reduction
16:57:46 <Babbot45> but i think 3G only would be good addition
16:57:48 <nscnt[m]> hiroshi: Yes. You must enable USB debugging and view the log with Logcat while the Seamless Update Client is running. However, this isn't recommended for production devices that are supposed to be secure. Is there a problem? I doubt you need to do this in the first place.
16:57:48 <somenerd[m]> I believe you can set your preferred network type
16:57:57 <Babbot45> yes im aware
16:58:07 <Babbot45> yes preferred set to 3g
16:58:19 <Babbot45> but i can still connect to 2g
16:58:26 <Babbot45> id like 3G only mode
16:58:52 <Babbot45> probably take 5 minutes to code
16:59:03 <somenerd[m]> > basically just 2g should be avoided due to no tower autgentication
16:59:04 <somenerd[m]> It's more that 2g has a lot of legacy code
16:59:19 <Babbot45> yes, so id like 3G only mode
17:00:07 <somenerd[m]> I suggest opening an issue if you think that this is relevant to GrapheneOS, and explain why: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker
17:01:15 <helloworldkk87[m> <Babbot45 "probably take 5 minutes to code"> Well code it and send it to them. Its open source

17:11:38 <AsianFemale23843> hi
17:12:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> hello everyone, trying to install via CLI on a pixel 5 via macos i get this error message trying to obtain the factory image. it failed at 90% anyone is familiar with the error curl: (56) LibreSSL SSL_read: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL, errno 54
17:12:38 <bluecream[m]> > <@bluecream:fairydust.space> I noticed that graphene is able to connect to wifi right after restart, when the device is still locked. (Dont know about other network), do you think this could be disabled, as i would consider wifi login data as personally identifying information.
17:12:38 <bluecream[m]> > I know it would interfer with the updater, but is it really worth it?
17:12:38 <bluecream[m]> Anyone thinking this could be worth a feature request?
17:13:41 <AsianFemale23843> turn wifi off before you turn off your phone
17:13:47 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: it may be possible that it is in principle doable to monitor notifications and set alarms, and IFTTT doesn't work maybe because it's just isn't optimized for multiple profiles. But I'm not an android developer so can't really do anything about this.
17:14:31 <AsianFemale23843> also the wifi mac is random even while scanning
17:14:51 <Zzzzzz> bluecream[m]: https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy The guide says wifi privacy is good when apps don't leak info, so maybe you don't need to?
17:14:55 <AsianFemale23843> so your graphene phone spoofs the mac upon every connect
17:15:06 <bluecream[m]> <AsianFemale23843 "turn wifi off before you turn of"> Well lol it works, stupid me thx
17:15:32 <AsianFemale23843> the phone randomizes wifi mac automatically anyway
17:15:53 <AsianFemale23843> but aps could send unencrypted data once wifi xonnects
17:16:44 <AsianFemale23843> your not stupid your just learning

17:24:04 <GhostSplinterSix> <AsianFemale23843 "hi"> Hello! What's goin' on? How's it going?
17:25:47 <bluecream[m]> I was think about, someone getting hands on your phone and figuring out who you are by 1. interfering the send signal via SSID, (i dont really know if thats possible) or 2. possibly narrowing down where you live (therefore how you are by trial and error)
17:27:51 <Zzzzzz> > someone getting hands on your phone and figuring out who you are by

18:28:55 <troypatrick[m]> First update on graphene OS and it went well fyi
18:30:41 <endless_strings[> I have one last question before I go. I saw a video from The Hated One about your phone listening to you with ultrasonic cross-device tracking. I don't want my other devices listening for example to videos that I watch in NewPipe. What I understood is that the only solution at the momment would be disconect those other devices from the internet. But I need some of those devices to speak with people that does not
18:30:41 <endless_strings[> use signal for example and use whatsapp, and it could be an emergency. So, I readed a comment that said that once we get our hands on those frequencies we could run an app to play them. But I don't know when will that happen or if it's that easy. So I wanted to ask, is there another way? I thought about maybe putting in those devices some sort of material that blocks those ultrasonic frequencies. Do you know if
18:30:41 <endless_strings[> something like that exist?
18:31:40 <jj1013[m]> <endless_strings[ "I have one last question before "> ... WHAT???

If I download those apps away from Aurora, can I trust what something VirusTotal tells me?  As I understand Google owns them too.
18:32:51 <endless_strings[> jj1013.: I believe that would not solve it

18:35:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> So are you basically unable to get any app that's only available via Google store ?
18:35:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Again, Signal can be downloaded from the APK link.Any other app, you can get it from the official website or F-Droid.
18:36:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> You could as well isolate Aurora Store on its own secondary GOS profile, then the apps you don't trust (Google-only and such), isolate them on their own GOS profile, too.
18:37:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Remember to log off the profiles as soon as you stop using them.
18:37:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Yeah but what I meant is like I got the Samsung SSD app, but through apkmirror, because it's only available on Google store, does that mean by downloading it as an apk it's still bringing a part of Google into my phone ?
18:37:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> The keys are put in rest for secondary profiles, but not for the owner.
18:38:08 <endless_strings[> Oh, I actually have another question xD, is the camera that comes with graphene os safe or would you recommend me to download another from fdroid?
18:38:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Not only does it bring a part of Google to your phone, it also brings extra insecurities. Again, APKMirror binaries can be infected with malware.
18:38:14 <Thatcher[m]> endless_strings the best solution is to get rid of your devices that you think are spying on you
18:38:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Also, why would you get a Samsung SSD app on GOS?
18:38:42 <endless_strings[> Thatcher: Lamentably that's not an option
18:39:11 <endless_strings[> for me I mean
18:39:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> You can't degoogle a Samsung. If you delete apps, the OS is still propietary. It still could be sending info.

18:46:49 <dazinism> APKMirror isn't a terrible place to get apps from. Its run by the folks who do Android Police and they do check and publish the app signature fingegprints
18:47:53 <dazinism> If you want to be extra careful you can check the fingerprints of the apk you download against another source before you install the app.
18:48:45 <dazinism> Think they get all their apps from the Play Store, so generally easier / safer to use Aurora Store
18:49:18 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Verifying_apk_files_and_apps
18:50:02 <WorstResponder> endless_strings[ check out https://github.com/fhstp/SoniControl
18:50:59 <void125[m]> * True.  But what if I need a phone that I can actually use?  I need work apps like Nextiva, Teams, Outlook.  If I download those apps away from Aurora, can I trust what something like VirusTotal tells me?  As I understand Google owns them too.
18:51:27 <dazinism> Even if you don't use APKMirror to download its a  pretty good place to check what the app signature fingerprint should be for apps you are getting from other sources
18:52:07 <WorstResponder> Outlook will not work anyway
18:55:17 <WorstResponder> If you intend to use your phone the way you are used to, with proprietary apps depending on things like Play Services, maybe it's better you just stick to stock.
19:00:05 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: Hey sorry I dropped off yesterday. Are you aware of any good app that can capture notifications (in a second profile)?
19:00:14 <Zzzzzz> As long as I can capture them and forward them through e.g. tunatoda emails, it's a workaround for second-profile notification that I can live with.
19:02:08 <WorstResponder> As was mentioned before, profiles are seperated in their own space, there is no way to access one profile's data through another. That's the whole point of profiles
19:03:22 <Zzzzzz> I am aware of that, I was talking about an app that lives in the second profile that captures that profile's notifications
19:03:57 <Zzzzzz> (and has to be still functional when I'm in the owner profile)
19:04:20 <Zzzzzz> and forwards those notification through e.g. draw-on-screen, or email
19:05:51 <WorstResponder> I might be wrong since I only use 1 profile, but I think as soon as you switch profiles, the other one is logged out and data is gone
19:06:37 <Zzzzzz> I just knew this yesterday that this behavior is only when you click "end session". If you don't and just switch profile, stuff from the other profile can still run in the background
19:06:53 <Zzzzzz> You can see it in the developer tools' running services
19:07:46 <WorstResponder> I don't think apps of an inactive profile remain active in the background
19:07:58 <WorstResponder> Again, this is just speculation
19:10:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Thanks for the responses , see The Samsung SSD I have is encrypted and to unlock it on the phone when you plug it in you need the app, then it makes it look like storage
19:12:27 <Zzzzzz> WorstResponder: I checked, the second profile is active if I just switch according to developer tools. Apparently my telegram is still receiving notifications in my second profile when I'm in the owner profile. I turned on airplane mode before I switched back to the second profile, and I can still see those new notifications, meaning it was running
19:12:28 <Zzzzzz> before I turned on the airplane mode.
19:14:12 <WorstResponder> That's as much as I can tell you unfortunately, I'm not versed enough in stuff like this
19:15:54 <Zzzzzz> Thanks though, I appreciate the help. I've been trying for some time to get some second-profile notification workaround working so I can ditch iOS, but to no avail :p
19:16:29 <WorstResponder> What's the point of wanting to do that anyway
19:17:00 <Zzzzzz> second profile notification or ditching ios?
19:17:07 <Zzzzzz> ditching ios: personal grudge
19:17:39 <WorstResponder> The profile thing
19:18:33 <floralshoppe[m]1> strange question but if i took the sim card out of my grapheneos phone and put a different carrier sim card in there is there identifying device information that could be shared between both carriers.
19:18:53 <Zzzzzz> That's because I want to install dodgy IM apps like FB messenger and WeChat, and want to be reached through them since my friends use them
19:19:06 <floralshoppe[m]1> i guess imei number?
19:19:09 <WorstResponder> floralshoppe[m]1 yes
19:20:55 <WorstResponder> Zzzzzz that's sad
19:21:05 <Zzzzzz> I know...
19:22:18 <WorstResponder> I ditched "social" media about 2 years ago, never looked back. Friends who wanna reach me can do so through other means (most of them use Signal now), others who don't want to, well... They're not that important
19:24:23 <WorstResponder> At this point I would even prefer calls over the cellular network over some random chinese spyware
19:26:13 <Zzzzzz> Sadly I have to live with that Chinese spyware as long as my family consider it the gold standard of the Internet
19:27:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> Spyware is spyware, it doesn't really matter if it was originally developed in China.
19:27:50 <Zzzzzz> Yes, that's why FB messenger goes to another profile too
19:29:33 <Zzzzzz> In any case, no second-profile notification means I'm stuck with iOS for a bit longer.
19:30:30 <dazinism> Zzzzzz: could try Easer in the secondary profile for listening for notifications
19:30:43 <dazinism> Not sure what you would use to forward them on
19:30:51 <dazinism> Need something that would use network
19:31:40 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: I can try again. It was super hard to get working even with time-based triggers.
19:32:22 <dazinism> Zzzzzz: or this can act on notifications
19:32:25 <dazinism> http://projectmaxs.org
19:32:45 <Uwe> Hi everybody. I¬† just try to flash graphenOS on a 4a and I get an "< waiting for any device >" after "fastboot flashing unlock" and thts it. Do you have any idea why this could happend?
19:33:08 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: My original plan was to have it set alarms 1 minute after it captures notifications -- a bit more hacky :P
19:33:17 <Zzzzzz> > http://projectmaxs.org ooh, I should check this out. Thanks!
19:33:31 <dazinism> Zzzzzz Would send stuff via xmpp. Which I guess means you need a server set up somewhere.
19:33:49 <skwisgaar[m]> @freenode_WorstResponder:matrix.org: where did you learn that imei is shared when switching sims?
19:34:19 <dazinism> ...wonder if you could set up an xmpp server on the device in termux
19:36:57 <Zzzzzz> > set up an xmpp server on the device in termux
19:36:57 <Zzzzzz> If this were possible then cross-profile communication becomes possible, I doubt this is the case
19:37:35 <skwisgaar[m]> floralshoppe: you probably want to ask a dev whether carrier data is actually shared when switching sims
19:37:58 <WorstResponder> The IMEI is hardcoded and sent to the carrier as identification
19:38:27 <WorstResponder> It's how cellular networks work
19:38:38 <skwisgaar[m]> The question was about imei being leaked between carriers
19:38:43 <skwisgaar[m]> Different carriers
19:40:37 <Zzzzzz> ^ They will both know this particular IMEI connects through them.
19:41:19 <skwisgaar[m]> Oh I‚Äôm dumb
19:41:31 <WorstResponder> Lol
19:41:46 <skwisgaar[m]> Forgot IMEI is device specific
19:42:00 <WorstResponder> That's what I said
19:42:18 <WorstResponder> Basically
19:43:01 <neelix> Hello guys, anyone experienced some lag after unlocking the phone with fingerprint after the latest update?
19:43:36 <WorstResponder> No
19:45:59 <dazinism> Zzzzzz: the other thing you could do is use Shelter or Insular to create a work profile. Its not really  recommended as it has  security implications.
19:46:38 <dazinism> Does let you have a second profile that displays notifications on the main user
19:47:17 <dazinism> The boundary between a work and main profile is more porous than a main and secondary profile
19:47:37 <neelix> ok WokeBillKristol[
19:47:41 <dazinism> The app that sets it up defines a lot of stuff about how porous
19:53:15 <dazinism> Zzzzzz: would be neat to figure out a way to forward notifications from secondary profile. Very interested to hear if you manage
19:54:02 <jj1013[m]> <dazinism "Zzzzzz: would be neat to figure "> As far as I know, there is no way to do that.
19:56:29 <dazinism> jj1013.: was wondering about using http://projectmaxs.org
19:56:38 <dazinism> I may have to try....
19:57:13 <dazinism> Means you have to trust an xmpp server somewhere
19:57:26 <jj1013[m]> It is recommended to close secondary profiles when not using them anyways.
19:58:11 <neelix> ^
19:58:11 <kracklepop[m]> <neelix "Hello guys, anyone experienced s"> No
19:58:32 <jj1013[m]> <kracklepop[m] "No"> ^
19:59:13 <neelix> ok
20:06:11 <Alex54> TheJollyRoger: After a lot of troubleshooting, I was finally able to get the stock OS back onto my Pixel 3a XL. What I had to do was manually request the device to reboot to the bootloader using hardware keys after the stock OS was installed. If I just let my phone automatically reboot & send me to the bootloader after the OS installation, it would
20:06:11 <Alex54> give me errors when trying to start the device after removing the custom key & locking the bootloader. I feel like this should be documented on the GrapheneOS website so other people don't have similar issues when trying to revert their devices.
20:17:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Alex54, which section are you referring to, do you have any suggested wording?
20:18:25 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, I can try to emphasize to use the combo keys to reboot, rather than an automatic reboot or the reboot bootloader command.
20:18:39 <TheJollyRoger> *to boot the bootloader
20:25:31 <Xyber77> Hi, does the spellcheck connect to the internet or use a local database
20:26:03 <TheJollyRoger> Xyber77: As far as I know for the included GrapheneOS keyboard, it uses a local database.
20:26:24 <Xyber77> also requesting always on privacy mode for chrome browser
20:26:42 <Xyber77> vanadium
20:26:46 <TheJollyRoger> Xyber77: there is an existing way to do that, actually.
20:27:19 <TheJollyRoger> Xyber77: because many websites can easily detect when you are using incognito mode (which is identifying information), we leave this up to you: press and hold the Vanadium icon when you are on the homescreen.
20:27:30 <TheJollyRoger> You should see a menu pop up, one of which says "New Incognito window."
20:27:39 <TheJollyRoger> Press and hold that and drag it onto your home screen.
20:28:14 <Xyber77> if icognito mode is a local setting
20:28:22 <Xyber77> how do local sites see it?
20:28:50 <TheJollyRoger> Xyber77: simple: an easy (if inelegant) way is to attempt to write a large amount of data to cache.
20:29:03 <Xyber77> can supercookies be set on vanadium/GOS?
20:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> If that fails, then you know the browser is incognito.
20:29:12 <Xyber77> true
20:29:45 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, GrapheneOS found that out by accident, when people complained that the installer would not work in Incognito mode.
20:29:52 <Xyber77> thoughts on riseup vpn
20:30:03 <TheJollyRoger> VPNs are not topical to GrapheneOS, but you can ask in #grapheneos-offtopic.
20:30:06 <Xyber77> which installer?
20:30:36 <TheJollyRoger> Xyber77: GrapheneOS has a web-based installer that allows you to install GrapheneOS to a phone in fastboot connected to your PC (or another Android phone) by visiting https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:31:06 <TheJollyRoger> The reason it doesn't work in incognito mode is because the browser says "Hey, you're downloading a large amount of data. Nah, you ain't going to need this."
20:31:09 <Xyber77> is that new?
20:31:19 <TheJollyRoger> It's been around for several months now.
20:31:28 <TheJollyRoger> It's the recommended way of installing GrapheneOS.
20:33:05 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome back Xyber77/AlexVance7: for the record: upstream has already cracked down on the use of supercookies/Locally Stored Objects
20:33:08 <AlexVance7> if malware gets onto gos, does reformat clear most malware
20:33:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
20:33:27 <TheJollyRoger> Just do a factory reset.
20:33:29 <AlexVance7> is there anyway to securely overwrite data
20:33:39 <TheJollyRoger> Factory reset or delete the profile that the data was stored in.
20:33:52 <AlexVance7> alright
20:34:05 <AlexVance7> if i had bitcoin billions id donate 1 mill
20:34:17 <AlexVance7> gos is awesome
20:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> Every little bit helps.
20:35:03 <Alex54> TheJollyRoger: Try to emphasize that when reverting to the stock OS, after it has been freshly installed, you should manually boot the device into the bootloader using the combo keys instead of letting it automatically reboot. Then you should remove the custom key & lock the bootloader. Otherwise, you may get a message when trying to start the
20:35:04 <Alex54> device from the bootloader like "No valid slot to boot".
20:35:23 <TheJollyRoger> Alex54: sure, I will get a draft done when I get back to the computer today.
20:35:36 <Alex54> Awesome
20:36:16 <AlexVance7> it would be cool to have a systemwide tor feature
20:36:31 <AlexVance7> a systemwide transparent tor proxy
20:36:34 <Alex54> TheJollyRoger: Thank you for your help¬†(y)
20:36:38 <AlexVance7> like calyxos

20:47:20 <grapheneos_user_> TheJollyRoger Did I join at a bad time
20:47:47 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, not at all.
20:48:02 <grapheneos_user_> Saw a bunch of ban evasion stuff
20:48:26 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, nothing beyond the usual.
20:48:44 <TheJollyRoger> I've decided for logbot I should start recording parts and joins.
20:49:05 <grapheneos_user_> Ah
20:49:10 <grapheneos_user_> That's a good idea
20:52:28 <RileyReid7> what should safe browsing be set too
20:53:09 <RileyReid7> safe browsing is google botnet right?
20:54:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <RileyReid7 "safe browsing is google botnet r"> No
20:54:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's compared locally
20:55:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Not sure even if it pinged Google, how it would be a botnet
20:55:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Ah good call TheJollyRoger
20:55:53 <TheJollyRoger> RileyReid7/GrandeBiblioteca (*@185.156.175.171) has been banned for ban evasion (Adam1177)
20:58:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Fiery has joined the Telegram Group!
20:58:16 <Adam118> hi id like to apeal my 'ban'
20:58:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yes?
20:58:30 <skwisgaar[m]> Jolly working overtime today
20:58:39 <Adam118> please stop kicking me
20:58:43 <TheJollyRoger> Adam118 - I can let you back in on a few conditions:
20:58:51 <Adam118> im not spamming
20:59:19 <TheJollyRoger> A) You pick one name, and you stick with it. B) You read the FAQ and commit it to memory first and stop harassing us with feature requests.
21:00:00 <TheJollyRoger> C) You be respectful of our developers' time and stop harassing us with dumb questions.
21:00:53 <TheJollyRoger> D) When we tell you something, you listen to it, rather than ignoring it and spreading misinformation, then pretending to be "learning."
21:01:24 <Adam118> why cant i ask for features?
21:02:24 <TheJollyRoger> Because we're already working overtime, the features in GrapheneOS have been very carefully designed with a particular threat model and use case in mind, and if you want these features so badly, it's up to you to either pay someone to have them developed, or code and contribute the code yourself.
21:05:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you can agree to these conditions and to stop harassing our developers, I can put you on a one month probationary period if you can behave yourself. You get one nickname, and you stick to it.
21:07:35 <Adam118> i like choosing new nicknames, but i agree to all terms :-)
21:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, and he left before hearing what I had to say or continuing the conversation.
21:09:44 * TheJollyRoger shrugs.
21:09:50 <TheJollyRoger> Guess he didn't take it all that seriously.
21:16:15 <TheJollyRoger> His ban stands.
21:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> (Well, unless he can turn over a new leaf. Eh.)
21:20:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Hi jolly, if I was to download an app via apkmirror without checking the "checksum" and I infected my phone with malware, what would be the best option? Reflash my phone, factory reset, or anti virus software ?
21:20:42 <TheJollyRoger> Factory reset.
21:20:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> May I remind you people on the other side of the bridge can not see what Telegrammers are replying too.
21:21:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> *to
21:21:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> @lp4678
21:21:33 <TheJollyRoger> @lp4678 - Remember that you have verified boot. Each instance of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical and verified to be authentic down to the last bit every time your phone reboots, once the bootloader is locked.
21:21:44 <TheJollyRoger> So flashing your phone a second time does nothing that a factory reset won't do.
21:22:26 <TheJollyRoger> If your the system partition is damaged beyond repair to the point where the bootloader can't revert any changes to it, your phone just won't boot.
21:23:22 <TheJollyRoger> Antivirus software is mostly a scam these days; it just enumerates what's known to be bad, and usually, by the time the viruses are discovered, the malware authors have already changed them.
21:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> Even if it was theoretically perfect, remember that apps are always sandboxed individually and don't see outside their own sandbox unless you give them permission to. For antivirus software to do anything meaningful at all in GrapheneOS it'd have to countermand the Android security model, which would mean you'd end up with MASSIVE amounts of attack surface and a gaping security flaw.
21:25:09 <TheJollyRoger> Antivirus is a holdover left over from the 1990's way of thinking: there are places for it, such as on mail relaying agents, but on endpoint devices antivirus has no purpose.
21:25:27 <TheJollyRoger> *thinking;
21:26:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Yeah that makes sense I think I'm going to have to study this verifying apps part on the wiki
21:28:31 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Antivirus is a holdover left ove"> ...
21:29:25 <jj1013[m]> Soon enough maybe I find out that I am trapped in the Matrix?
21:29:47 <jj1013[m]>  * Soon enough maybe I find out that I am trapped in The Matrix?
21:29:48 <jj1013[m]> (EDIT: forgot to capitalize "the")
21:30:22 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: Antivirus can enumerate what's known to be bad, but it doesn't provide things like mandatory access controls, system sandboxing, operating system permissions, exploit mitigations, data execution prevention, and all those lovely preemptive measures that it's the responsibility of the *operating system* to implement.
21:30:54 <TheJollyRoger> the old saying is: "prevention is better than cure."
21:31:56 <jj1013[m]> Figures, why my family does not ask against a health risk until somebody gets sick.
21:32:17 <jj1013[m]>  * Figures, why my family does not act against a health risk until somebody gets sick.
21:32:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
21:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy jess.
21:33:24 <jj1013[m]> I wonder what will my Zion nickname end up being, ha ha.
21:33:35 <TheJollyRoger> I like to analogize installing antivirus, as cutting a hole in your stomach and inserting an optical tube, to inspect your stomach for bad things you've eaten. While it's doable, it causes more problems than it is worth.
21:34:26 <TheJollyRoger> Again, there are places where antivirus has its place: for instance, on a mail transfer or mail recieving agent.
21:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> But that's an extremely niche application.
21:35:39 <TheJollyRoger> And generally when you go buy antivirus, they're not selling it for that. Generally, the reason companies buy antivirus these days, is because when a compromise happens, they want to be able to say "Look, we were doing as much as we could right, see, we even paid big bucks to get this expensive antivirus, see? We did our due diligence! See? See?"
21:41:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> ahhh yes that's makes sense . So I've read the verify apps on wiki, but I don't fully under stand the process, if you were to now download an app from apkmirror, and you wanted to verify it, what would you do in order to be happy with the app
21:46:28 <TheJollyRoger> @lp4678 Well, first what you'd do would be to go get a plane ticket to the person who develops the app, and journey to meet them in-person to obtain proof of their identity, and the real SHA-256 of their certificate.
21:48:20 <TheJollyRoger> Or if you have an existing, preauthenticated back-channel to them that you trust, you ask them over that.
21:49:08 <TheJollyRoger> because Google recognizes that most of us will have neither, it trusts the first certificate it sees, and pins it in place.
21:49:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Ha I read this earlier , so is there something you can match that's provided by Google store ? So could I go on a desktop windows pc , find the app in Google play store website, would there be some sort of certificate or code provided on the Google play website that I could cross reference with the app provided by apkmirror for example ? So at least then you know what you are downloading would be the app provided by Google p
21:49:54 <TheJollyRoger> Cut off at "would be the app provided by Google p--"
21:50:24 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think Google actually provides you a way to download it unless you have a Google account, but I could be wrong.
21:51:35 <TheJollyRoger> If you found a way to download them, or download them onto a phone with Google Play, you could simply extract the SHA256 of the certificate with apksigner. But I couldn't tell you how to do that, since I don't know, myself.
21:52:28 <TheJollyRoger> The command sequence for apksigner is "apksigner verify --verbose --print certificate [name-of-the-apk]"
21:54:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Awww ok, yeah I was just wondering how other people do it because people have said "have you verified the app" so I'm just wanting to find out how other people do it
21:54:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Thanks for the replies
21:54:34 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I don't, I just download them from the author's github and hope for the best.
21:54:40 <TheJollyRoger> Or from the official site.
21:55:01 <TheJollyRoger> In this case, the mirrors (where they are stored), and the certificate authorities become trusted third parties for the initial pairing.
21:55:03 <TheJollyRoger> In a trust-on
21:55:11 <TheJollyRoger> -first-contact arrangement.
21:55:24 <TheJollyRoger> That's about as best as I can do.
21:55:57 <gdc> richard gerber
21:56:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Yeah great, most things I'm just using vanadium for, so like banking , instead of using the app I just go on vanadium, takes a bit longer but I suppose that's a better option
21:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, that's a good plan.
21:58:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> If you were to delete a user profile , does it get rid of any risk that might have been in there
22:00:29 <TheJollyRoger> @lp4678 if you delete a user profile, the security chip will turn over its token. The data in it will be gone because the token to decrypt it will no longer be around. No ifs ands or buts.
22:02:41 <TheJollyRoger> The same goes if you factory reset - and that will do it for the owner profile.
22:02:47 <TheJollyRoger> *as well as all the others.
22:04:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> That's good news, you know the original pixel 5 camera app , is it closed source?
22:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
22:04:57 <TheJollyRoger> Google Camera is proprietary.
22:10:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Google Camera is proprietary."> Nice
22:14:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãonorablepee> Is there a way to use WhatsApp in a more private way through grapheneos
22:15:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãonorablepee> It‚Äôs because I need it for business but I‚Äôm trying to cut it out
22:15:27 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: > the other thing you could do is use Shelter or Insular to create a work profile
22:15:28 <Zzzzzz> I am already using the work profile for Snapchat because it hard requires media access lol
22:15:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãonorablepee> I read about using the matrix bridge
22:16:55 <Zzzzzz> h‚Äãonorablepee: if you install it in a second profile or the work profile, you can put more restrictions on its sandbox (keep it from discovering/communicating with apps in other profiles)
22:17:37 <Zzzzzz> But, not really private in the sense they don't know who you are, because you login in the app :P
22:19:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãonorablepee> Thanks Zzzzzz. I‚Äôm trying to limit WhatsApp as much as possible. It‚Äôs a shame people are too dumb not to use better messengers
22:25:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> I've downloaded that classy shark after reading the verify apps wiki page, when you scan apps that are from f-droid or bundled into graphene os, the results usually come back with 0 trackers, however telegram has Google analytics firebase tracker , is this something to worry about it terms of security/privacy?
22:29:50 <Zzzzzz> h‚Äãonorablepee: just know that if you put it in a second profile, its notifications will be muted when you're not in that profile, and you'll have to manually switch to that profile and check. Work profile has notifications but is less secure
22:30:35 <dazinism> lp4678 : firebase is what the app developers use to monitor use of their app.
22:31:13 <Cliff[m]> Does running a secondary profile as main consume more battery?
22:31:42 <dazinism> lp4678 : apk Mirror is pretty safe. If you are worried about an app you downloaded from there you can check the sig fingerprint of installed apps
22:32:40 <Cliff[m]> <Zzzzzz "honorablepee: just know that if "> What do you mean less secure?
22:33:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> When you check the sig fingerprint , where do you find the original sig fingerprint to compare to ?
22:33:09 <dazinism> Cliff: I imagine a bit more, but don't think it  should be huge if the main profile doesn't have a load of apps also firing up and doing stuff.
22:34:15 <Cliff[m]> dazinism only vpn is it posibble to block internet connection in a single profile?
22:35:18 <dazinism> lp4678 : places I know that have a lot of fingerprints listed are apkmirror and https://exodus-privacy.eu.org
22:36:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Thank you
22:36:34 <dazinism> Cliff: multi profile and VPNs are a bit confusing. What are you trying to do?
22:37:52 <Zzzzzz> Cliff[m]: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210307#c7165648
22:38:13 <Cliff[m]> Can i run a work third profile without access to internet completely offline?
22:38:35 <Cliff[m]> But not affecting the internet acces of the rest
22:39:27 <Zzzzzz> There can be only 1 work profile
22:39:44 <Zzzzzz> If there can be multiple, I'm instantly in
22:39:47 <Zzzzzz> but no
22:40:03 <dazinism> lp4678 when I've checked apps I've downloaded via Aurora store against the fingerprints listed on those sites they've always matched. As you would expect
22:40:27 <Cliff[m]> Can the second one have no internetacces when i enable airplane mode it also blocks in the first profile
22:40:53 <dazinism> Cliff: I've done this using NetGuard
22:42:08 <dazinism> Set that as always on VPN for a profile and turn on the  'block connections without VPN' toggle
22:42:21 <dazinism> Then nothing can get network
22:42:54 <dazinism> Its a bit hacky. But with the way NetGuard functions that works.
22:43:22 <dazinism> * Then nothing in that profile can get network
22:46:02 <Cliff[m]> dazinism nice thanks!
22:47:58 <dazinism> That would be a nice simple app someone could write - NetBlock - just a toggle to block all network for a profile.
22:49:11 <dazinism> Using the VPN functionality
22:49:58 <dazinism> Cliff: I should say I've not done extensive testing
22:50:47 <dazinism> Its a bit confusing how VPNs work when changing from one user profile to another.
22:51:10 <dazinism> If its real important you may want to test
22:51:24 <Cliff[m]> Ill tr it out before storing data there thanks
22:51:30 <Cliff[m]> Try*
22:51:54 <dazinism> nextdns can be useful for checking what connections your device is making
22:56:59 <dazinism> Although also need to consider an app could connect straight to an IP address without making a dns request
22:59:39 <dazinism> Cliff: the way VPNs work when enabling one in a different profile changed in AOSP 11
23:03:19 <zvl12[m]> <jj1013[m] "You can also use https://molly.i"> can anyone share his experience with Molly ?
23:11:03 <dazinism> zvl12: its pretty nice. The developer hangs out here a bit
23:12:51 <jj1013[m]> <zvl12[m] "can anyone share his experience "> Unlike Signal, Molly (the FOSS build called Molly-FOSS) does not depend on Google Services, so it is useful for a degoogled ROM such as LineageOS or GrapheneOS itself.
23:13:43 <zvl12[m]> <dazinism "zvl12: its pretty nice. The deve"> just installed it, and its a nice way to get 2 signals app on the same profile, not so much for the encryption as GOS already providing this
23:14:14 <jj1013[m]> Even though the servers are centralized, the password you set for encrypting your messages (I had this option IIRC) makes this irrelevant, since no one who owns the server can see your messages.

23:14:45 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "> <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Unl"> Molly-FOSS can notify you when you receive a message, and not tell you what it says or who is it.
23:14:59 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "> <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Unl"> Oh, wait. Yes.
23:15:14 <zvl12[m]> so better installing the FOSS version
23:15:17 <jj1013[m]> You do need to unlock Molly if you want to see notifications...
23:15:43 <jj1013[m]> <zvl12[m] "so better installing the FOSS ve"> Yes.
23:16:36 <jj1013[m]> Just set the phone to lock immediately once you press the lock button, always lock your phone when you stop using it and use fingerprint unlock for convenience if you use a really long passphrase just like I do.
23:17:27 <jj1013[m]> I might change it when I get GrapheneOS, though... this is Linux, so my LUKS encryption passphrase may have been compromised. Who knows? I've got no QubesOS, only Debian.
23:18:56 <zvl12[m]> <jj1013[m] "Just set the phone to lock immed"> i prefer 4 digits pin code to quickly unlock than fingerprint....
23:40:05 <dazinism> jj1013.: if you've not got Google Play (or microG) on a device any version of Signal or Molly gets push notifications straight from Signals servers rather than via Googles push notifications
23:55:38 <bypassbobby[m]> Also never use face ID police recently held a phone upto someone's I knows face and unlocked there phone
