00:00:31 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: If there were large amounts of people that were doing that, that would be fantastic, but I don't think many people will have that kind of a setup.
00:01:13 <TheJollyRoger> The big thing about anonymity is that what makes it effective tends to be a large amount of people all looking the same: when Peter looks the same as Patrick, and Patrick similarly is indistinguishable from Anita, who looks like Alice...
00:01:16 <duck[m]> how does the security of arm trustzone compare to titan m
00:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> The more people join their crowd, the harder it will be, to tell Peter from Alice because the bigger their anonymity set is.
00:02:37 <TheJollyRoger> duck[m]: the Titan M is a different chip entirely, it's physically separated and it's specifically designed to isolate against things like timing attacks or side-channels.
00:03:24 <TheJollyRoger> The Titan M was designed for mobile phones specifically.
00:04:13 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "justanotherlurker: If there were"> That's why I keep suggesting it on mobile. One would get tor anonymity without ff's sandboxing shortcomings.
00:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> Timing attacks, and side-channel leaks are an issue with ARM Trustzone, which is why Google figured they would do their own security chip.
00:05:02 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: Well... ideally, the people to suggest it to would be the Tor Browser developers.
00:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> Since that way, they could roll out the change for *everyone* all at once.
00:05:57 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "justanotherlurker: Well... ideal"> But then what about desktop?
00:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> Since that's what you want: you don't want fragmentation, or you actually paradoxically end up harming your own anonymity set, *and* those of the others.
00:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> That's unfortunately what upstream is going to have to figure out.
00:06:29 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "Since that's what you want: you "> I agree.
00:06:57 <justanotherlurke> Like merging vanadium and bromide sounds great...
00:07:12 <TheJollyRoger> It's unfortunate though but Tor Browser has a *huge* amount of Firefox-specific tooling; a buddy of mine, Jeremy Rand, is in the process of porting Tor Browser to PowerPC64 Little Endian, and discovered that some of the tooling is REALLY old.
00:07:28 <TheJollyRoger> Like, we are talking bootstrapping from before the days of Debian Jessie old.
00:07:56 <louipc> ouch
00:08:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:08:23 <justanotherlurke> That's the challenge, I guess. Rewriting means throwing away most of it. Trying to fix remains trying.
00:08:41 <TheJollyRoger> And having to use reaaally old GCC binaries that are specific to the x86, that sort of thing.
00:09:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> So that's probably why Upstream Tor Browser is in a hard spot. They've invested so much effort into Firefox, but are kind of stuck.
00:11:08 <justanotherlurke> Exactly. Best combustion engine 20 years from now....
00:11:56 <yhtr654> Hello, I wanted to ask a quick question.
00:11:57 <yhtr654> I noticed that CalyxOS and GrapheneOS both take the Pixel-only route. What is it about Pixels that make them presumably the best option for a security-focused custom ROM?
00:11:57 <yhtr654> Also I see you're talking about Tor Browser's relationship with Firefox/Mozilla. I was actually talking to someone else about that. While I'm here, what are the possibilities for the future of Tor Browser? What about a switch to degoogled-chromium? Is the only option starting a project to build a new browser, engine included, from scratch, under a
00:11:58 <yhtr654> F/OSS license?
00:12:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hello yhtr654, I'll break it down a little:
00:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> In a nutshell, GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, RattleSnakeOS, and #!OS (HashBangOS) all focus on Pixel exclusively because all other Android OEM handset vendors either deliberately, or through their own incompetence, cripple the handset's bootloader security features if you run your own operating system on them that isn't the vendor's.
00:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung, for instance, will permanently blow out fusing in your bootloader if you attempt to change the bootloader lock state, and then say "you bought it, it's your problem now."
00:15:42 <yhtr654> I see...ironic that it's only Google that doesn't do that, haha.
00:16:01 <TheJollyRoger> The second reason is that the Pixels have the most diligence in terms of upstream and vendor support, and the best security features, and the best IOMMU mitigations/modem isolation.
00:16:33 <TheJollyRoger> They're also the most open; plenty of other vendors, again Samsung is a grevious offender in this, do proprietary everything, and don't play nice.
00:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> yhtr654: well, it makes sense: Google doesn't actually make that much money off the Pixel handsets. They make money off the licensing and Android Ecosystem, so they actually want people to be developing for Android and contributing to upstream.
00:17:27 <TheJollyRoger> So they make it easy for us.
00:17:47 <TheJollyRoger> From a simple game theory standpoint, when you take the "big picture" into account, it actually makes a surprising amount of sense.
00:17:52 <TheJollyRoger> They do it because it makes them more money in the end.
00:19:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Even Google appears to clamp down the bootloaders on their refurbs.  I tried two allegedly unlocked Pixel phones from refurbishers, only one of which could OEM unlock, and neither of which would respond to fastboot unlock at all.
00:20:03 <justanotherlurke> <yhtr654 "I noticed that CalyxOS and Graph"> Quoting https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html:
00:20:05 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixels are also what I'd consider a "reference implementation" of Android, so Google spends time, money and diligence on making sure their handsets are the "yardstick" by which all others are judged against in terms not just of completeness of the API, but also in software and firmware support.
00:20:16 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I assume their line of thought is that if they are going to take a loss on a device that hard, then they might as well monetize you without you getting another say
00:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: I've heard of this as well... unfortunately I can tell you the reason why this happens but it's far less conspiratorial than you think:
00:21:03 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Tell me a story, Mr. Jolly Roger
00:21:38 <yhtr654> I'd like to hear as well.
00:21:43 <TheJollyRoger> It's partially because toward the end of a handset's life, the resellers will try to bail as many devices as they can to shift the stock off their shelves, which has the effect of flooding the market with locked devices they want to get rid of before they become useless. Usually at this time, many people are trading in most of their old devices because they've paid off their tabs.
00:22:12 <TheJollyRoger> This has the effect of flooding the market with previously owned devices, many of which were sold at retail and are carrier and bootloader locked, and at that point, many of them no longer have their original packaging.
00:23:00 <TheJollyRoger> The kids being paid eight bucks an hour to box them up and ship them out aren't going to be checking.
00:23:11 <TheJollyRoger> Either to put them into their retail boxes or sort them out by SKU.
00:24:25 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Oof, the last part does make sense
00:24:34 <TheJollyRoger> So it's not that Google is running this great big conspiracy to lure you in with an unlockable handset and then bait-and-switch you to lock you in, it's because the kids being paid eight bucks an hour to sort their wares at retail aren't told the difference and don't check to see what SKU number is.
00:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> Chances are, if you send in a phone to be refurbished and get back a locked one, it's due to this: it's cheaper for them to replace an RMA'd used version with one that got sent back in and still works.
00:25:38 <TheJollyRoger> But again, the kids throwing phones in boxes don't know that there *is* a difference.
00:26:24 <TheJollyRoger> Toward the end of the phone's life, carrier locked phones essentially get bailed as waste or nearly so, and often the sellers don't know the difference anyways.
00:26:28 <TheJollyRoger> That's why.
00:31:39 <TheJollyRoger> I should stress - "Towards the end of a phone's life" generally means when people start paying off their tabs, or once the supplies of the phone start running low at Google.
00:31:56 <TheJollyRoger> In some cases this can mean as little as 6 months, to a year.
00:33:20 <TheJollyRoger> Since that's what we saw with the Pixel 4.
00:34:29 <TheJollyRoger> yhtr654: if you'd like to discuss more on Tor Browser and Chromium specifically, I'd like to cordially invite you to the #grapheneos-offtopic channel, where you'll likely find people who'll discuss it more in depth!
00:34:44 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Is that so?  I hadn't been interested in a new phone in several years and didn't realize the 4's effective attention span was so short
00:34:55 <yhtr654> Thanks for the info, and yeah I'll do that.
00:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: yeah, I was too. It's a good phone but... the problem was it just didn't deliver very good percieved value, being as expensive as it was, and I gather the impression that a lot of people did not like Google trying to turn it into the "iAndroid" especially removing the fingerprint scanner.
00:37:00 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Given this, do you suppose the support window for the 4 will indeed be as long as expected and that the project hopes for?
00:37:32 <yhtr654> But yeah one more question regarding GrapheneOS while on this topic, how much longer will Pixel 4a be supported? Is it recommended to just get an unlocked Pixel 5 instead?
00:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: It'll remain supported for three years from the day it first appeared on the Google Store, because likely Google has already paid Qualcomm for three years of firmware and out-of-tree code support.
00:37:45 <TheJollyRoger> As well as publicly committed to supporting it.
00:37:51 <yhtr654> Ah, thanks mr_hebi, lol
00:37:53 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I admit I was unimpressed when the 3 took away the headphone jack, and was less impressed that the 4 took away yet more.  The 4a was a relief
00:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> yhtr654: To get an idea of how long Pixels are supported for, look at the date that they were first released and sold publicly in the Google Store, then count three years.
00:39:44 <TheJollyRoger> That's how long they'll be supported for from upstream and from Qualcomm.
00:40:23 <TheJollyRoger> Once Qualcomm abandons the handset though, they essentially force our hand to abandon it as well, since once Qualcomm stops maintaining the handset, it is no longer going to be keeping pace with exploits.
00:40:52 <TheJollyRoger> But it's more than likely that once Google releases the handset on the store, they've already paid Qualcomm for, and Qualcomm has agreed to those three years.
00:42:04 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Fascinating, I didn't know the support hole went quite that deep
00:42:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The way it works with SoCs is... a little weird.
00:42:59 <TheJollyRoger> I should preface this with that Linux as a kernel lacks a stable driver interface.
00:43:13 <TheJollyRoger> This is, according to the kernel developers, a "feature."
00:43:36 <Lupita[m]> Is exFAT supported on GOS?
00:43:36 <Lupita[m]> I can't mount a newly formatted exFAT microsd connected via USB OTG adapter.
00:43:36 <Lupita[m]> And GOS formats the microsd as FAT32, not great for 512gb card.
00:43:56 <TheJollyRoger> So the idea is, people who want drivers to run in Linux have to write their drivers into the kernel, one way or another, or compile a stub interface into the kernel to talk to a binary driver running in kernel space, the way Nvidia does it.
00:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> Lupita[m]: I don't think so, not at this time.
00:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> So, what ends up happening is that the chip vendors (Qualcomm, in this case) design the chip to work with one kernel that they then freeze in time.
00:45:20 <TheJollyRoger> Qualcomm then tries to backport security fixes to it, and puts in a large amount of their own code.
00:45:38 <TheJollyRoger> Because Linux does not have a stable driver interface, this is what they have to do to get the kernel to support the SoC.
00:45:55 <TheJollyRoger> Couple that with the firmware: a modern phone doesn't just have one operating system, it runs dozens of them.
00:46:46 <TheJollyRoger> Phones will indeed have the firmware for the radios, but this is the same for a desktop: your SSD, your GPU, even your USB controller... all those devices need firmware.
00:47:02 <TheJollyRoger> So Qualcomm has to update those as well, and that means developer time.
00:47:21 <TheJollyRoger> So, the OEMs negotiate and come to an agreement with Qualcomm for how long Qualcomm keeps supporting their chip.
00:48:00 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> a question: does graphene's vanadium browser leak webrtc? and is firefox better?
00:48:02 <TheJollyRoger> Google negotiates and pays for three years, from their launch date. That's three years of Qualcomm committing to maintain the out-of-tree code for the kernel, and three years of them supplying signed and validated firmware updates for the SoC.
00:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> jdiidiebhdukdkks: I'll have to get back to you on WebRTC. Firefox is insecure because it is not internally sandboxed like Vanadium is.
00:49:06 <TheJollyRoger> jdiidiebhdukdkks: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing This explains the difference between Chromium and Firefox. The takeaway from it is that Firefox is insecure and has an "all your eggs in one basket" approach to security.
00:49:43 <TheJollyRoger> Some vendors pay for two years. Most of the other android phone vendors I've seen usually negotiate and pay for two.
00:50:09 <TheJollyRoger> Some pay for only one, and some don't bother negotiating for firmware and out of tree code updates, and simply release handsets that are insecure from before you've even bought them.
00:50:37 <goratellormandiv> For everyone physically blocking your camera lens, what is out there that serves as a more elegant solution than a piece of electrical tape?
00:50:39 <TheJollyRoger> So this is why some vendors (not gonna say which ones) can release phones that have insane amounts of RAM and cameras and big screens for comparatively cheap, and they seem like a bargain.
00:51:03 <TheJollyRoger> It's because all that cost is being paid for out of vendor diligence, not updating the kernel code, and not giving firmware updates.
00:51:47 <TheJollyRoger> I once read a YouTube comment that said "One Plus, I can pay $800 for a phone with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and a really powerful camera, with Google I pay $800 and I get 3GB of RAM and 64GB of storage? Why?"
00:52:26 <TheJollyRoger> That's where the money comes out of: insecure firmware, lack of attention to the kernel code, and not paying the OEM to update the firmware, and lying about security patch levels.
00:53:03 <goratellormandiv> I tried searching for one to purchase for a Pixel phone but all I found were web cam blockers
00:53:35 <goratellormandiv> I couldn't even find cases with opposable lens or camera blockers
00:54:56 <TheJollyRoger> goratellormandiv: I'm not sure. I think there are some cases that have little slides over them but can't remember who made them.
00:55:37 <goratellormandiv> Any leads on where I can get one would be wonderful
00:58:28 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I haven't got any suggestions at the moment, I just use a Spigen case because they're very protective, but they're also very inexpensive.
00:59:03 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: Is there any evidence about these issues with 3rd party providers?
00:59:37 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: well, given OnePlus' track record in this channel...
00:59:42 * TheJollyRoger grimaces.
00:59:45 <snooopy> :'D
01:00:34 <TheJollyRoger> I can't really point you to a concrete site you can read, but I can point you to that. Apparently, their implementations of verified boot are broken and so full of bugs to the point where you can boot them unverified and the phone will still say "verified!"
01:01:46 <snooopy> lets hope the EU makes the new law which should force retailer to give a garuantee for regular updates for a few years fast. that could help on that issue~
01:03:01 <snooopy> selling broken devices just because people don't see that they're broken shouldn't be allowed, but that is going faaaaaar offtopic
01:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: yeah.
01:28:57 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I gotta head off for a bit!
01:34:50 <fast1[m]> What do I need to do to ensure that apps in another user profile can't run in the background?

02:17:04 <timetravelingman> Does anyone else not have the LTE-only option anymore? After the January 23rd update?
02:17:43 <timetravelingman> For me, it basically disappeared after that, but on the flip side my phone never uses anything but LTE anyway
02:17:49 <timetravelingman> I'm on ATT
02:18:31 <SteveBallmer2456> Ill check
02:23:01 <GNUDimarik> this related with "no valid slot to boot" error. I hope it will help someone:
02:23:02 <GNUDimarik> I generated keys and extracted right vendor like described here: https://grapheneos.org/build#extracting-vendor-files-for-pixel-devices
02:23:02 <GNUDimarik> For making it work I flashed stock graphene os images before
02:23:13 <GNUDimarik> so now it works fine
02:23:29 <PsyberNetic16374> Hi
02:23:37 <PsyberNetic16374> I have LTE only mode still, yes
02:25:30 <Emvista[m]> Can the GrapheneOS camera only take photos?
02:25:58 <mr_hebi_san[m]> no, it scans QR.  I wouldn't be able to sync element if it couldn't
02:26:22 <Emvista[m]> Oh, found the switch. The video button was hidden.
02:26:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Aaah, that's a thing it can do too. :)
02:27:17 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Unfortunately I don't think any of the ROMs I've found have better or more intuitive cameras than stock
02:27:58 <Emvista[m]> It's actually pretty nice. I expected it to be worse based on the comments about it.
02:28:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Set the expectations low so they're easier to clear ;)
02:28:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I kid.  I really do notice a difference though, mostly in lower light indoors
02:30:26 <mr_hebi_san[m]> On the one hand, it's not a primary goal of this (or most) projects.  On the other hand, these sort of "superficial" things are what average users really care about.  You take away their Snapchat, their Insta, their Gmail, and now you tell them the camera's worse? 😆
02:30:52 <PsyberNetic16374> I think the camera is the same

03:31:10 <rny> and a special set of selinux policies that apply exclusively for gcam

04:18:57 <timetravelingman> <PsyberNetic16374 "I have LTE only mode still, yes"> Do you have AT&T?
04:26:28 <strcat[m]> Emvista: the AOSP Camera app has recently gotten a lot less bad due to fixes under the hood
04:26:43 <strcat[m]> and will soon properly support external USB cameras too not that it's actually useful
04:52:51 <noobna[m]> <timetravelingman "Does anyone else not have the LT"> I don't have the LTE option either

06:39:57 <TheJollyRoger> Jeremy_Rand_DT[m: oh, huh, oh wow.
06:40:05 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta admit, I kinda didn't think of that!
06:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> Glad there is some reason then o.O!
06:43:59 <strcat[m]> new release will be in beta soon
06:44:10 <strcat[m]> it just takes ages to generate deltas from 2 previous releases
06:44:23 <TheJollyRoger> \o/ Woohoo!
06:45:08 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> TheJollyRoger: the reason I remember is that they need a build container with a very old glibc, because if you build with a current glibc, the resulting binaries will fail to work properly on OS's whose glibc is older.  Tor Browser has a few users who are still on the oldest supported CentOS (I don't know why), so Tor Browser's build container needs to use a glibc that's less than or equal to the version in that
06:45:09 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> CentOS.  Which in practice means a really old Debian.
06:45:12 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> There are probably other reasons too, that's just the one I recall.
06:46:10 <strcat> lol @ self-inflicted GNU problems
06:49:02 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> In the big scheme of things there are much bigger issues with Tor Browser's build system workflow than just the usage of an old Debian.  Like the fact that no one besides a few Tor Project employees ever build it.  To the point that basically every time I poke that build system with a stick, I find a new issue, which is usually an issue that none of the Tor devs knew about.
06:51:22 <strcat> building code with old toolchains / libc is really bad
06:51:24 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> <strcat "lol @ self-inflicted GNU problem"> I actually heard a rumor that the Bitcoin Core devs are playing around with distributing binaries that are statically linked to musl.  I think this is the issue: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18110
06:51:26 <strcat> you get known vulnerabilities
06:51:37 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> Would be interesting if Tor moved in that direction
06:51:40 <strcat> Jeremy_Rand_DT[m: static linking isn't required to resolve this
06:51:44 <strcat> it's a self-inflicted issue
06:52:21 <strcat> you build Android apps with the latest SDK and dynamically link libc (generally) and it's backwards compatible with your minSdkVersion because there are API levels and new symbols are gated by them
06:52:42 <strcat> and libc has a symbol export list with API levels, as do other core libraries, and all the frameworks stuff
06:52:51 <strcat> they choose to have those issues
06:53:23 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> strcat: do you happen to have a link handy where I could read up on the vulns that show up from building with an old glibc?  I could point the Tor devs to it, maybe they'd be willing to resolve it.
06:53:53 <strcat> old toolchain is the main issue
06:56:12 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> strcat: the toolchain Tor uses is current (they build a current GCC and/or Clang from source), so if it's just a toolchain issue, Tor is fine
06:56:26 <strcat> it
06:56:32 <strcat> involves both
06:56:37 <strcat> but toolchain is more important
06:57:51 <TheJollyRoger> Jeremy_Rand_DT[m: Woah, oh wow, so that's why they're stranded on those old Debian containers and old binaries...
06:58:00 <TheJollyRoger> Oh man. That's...
06:58:04 <TheJollyRoger> Oh god.
06:59:07 <TheJollyRoger> Jeremy_Rand_DT[m: holy cow. So they're hamstrung by those last couple holdouts that are still straggling along on CentOS... 6? That's... aaargh.
07:01:36 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> strcat: if you can provide a link to reading material about the security impact that the old glibc (with a current toolchain) would have, I'd be happy to raise the concern with the Tor devs.  (This is not my area of specialty, but I enjoy learning, and I care about this.)
07:02:39 <JTL> Jeremy_Rand_DT[m: Gentoo's repositories have a bunch of scary warnings for old glibc versions, so they might know.
07:03:03 <TheJollyRoger> JTL oh hey that's a great idea. I'll go and start asking around.
07:03:14 <JTL> #gentoo or #gentoo-dev probably
07:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. I'll go join up.
07:03:57 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> JTL: I wouldn't be surprised if some of Gentoo's warnings are irrelevant here since Tor only uses the old glibc at build time (at run time the user uses the system glibc).
07:04:29 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> So I'm specifically interested in the issues that happen when an old glibc is used at build time but a new glibc is used at run time
07:04:39 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> Which is a weird enough scenario that I don't have any idea what search terms to use
07:05:23 <JTL> Without going in the further detail I'd probably figure out the rationale of whoever added those warnings in the first place.
07:07:14 <strcat> Jeremy_Rand_DT[m: at build time means they're using the old headers, runtime code, etc.
07:07:38 <strcat> so any security improvements / bug fixes in newer versions aren't there
07:10:14 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Gonna see who I can prod about this.
07:10:39 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> I guess the other question I'd have is: let's say I can convince the Tor devs that old glibc is a security problem.  Clearly they were running into some kind of compat issue when building with a new glibc.  It sounds from what strcat said that there's a more correct workaround than downgrading the build-time glibc... I am not familiar with what that workaround would be; is there documentation on what Tor Browser's
07:10:40 <Jeremy_Rand_DT[m> build scripts would need to do in order to work around it?
07:11:10 <strcat[m]> I mean, I consider using glibc and the GNU toolchain to be a problem
07:11:34 <strcat[m]> what I was saying is that glibc's compatibility issues are unnecessary and self-inflicted
07:11:54 <strcat[m]> they could have you declare the min version you support and make it work properly
07:11:57 <strcat[m]> when building with newest
07:12:08 <strcat[m]> they have to properly version when new symbols are introduced, etc.
07:12:43 <strcat[m]> and now imagine the platform is versioned that way as the old with a single simple API level: all libraries, APIs, etc.
07:13:16 <strcat[m]> not 1 library
07:13:19 <strcat[m]> all
07:13:22 <strcat[m]> and other APIs
07:16:06 <strcat> new release now in Beta
07:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> Fingers crossed!
07:19:41 <nonie689[m]> How can I set mobile to 3g and 4g only and just when it does not exist to gsm
07:20:12 <nonie689[m]> how can I Insert some apps into autostart?
07:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> nonie689[m]: You'll need to check Preferred Network under mobile data for the option. I don't know how much longer GSM will be around for since 2G is being phased out.
07:23:17 <nonie689[m]> When I set 4g (recommened) it chance sometimes to gsm - but 4g are availeble
07:24:19 <TheJollyRoger> nonie689[m]: set to "4G only."
07:25:14 <TheJollyRoger> 4G (recommended) will fall back to 3G or GSM if the signal for 4G is weak or the phone's not seeing it.
07:26:31 <nonie689[m]> I have.. but then i am sometimes without network
07:27:55 <TheJollyRoger> nonie689[m]: then there's nothing you can do. Likely what's happening is that your cellphone carrier is just being unreliable.
07:29:05 <TheJollyRoger> There are entirely innocent reasons for why 4G may drop off from time to time: your cellphone provider's problems aside, weather, network congestion, terrain, line of sight... it will depend on all that and more.
07:48:51 <nonie689[m]> And how can i add apps in autostart?
07:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> nonie689[m]: If I recall correctly the apps themselves must support it, but I could be wrong.
07:59:54 <hobo8818[m]> Any info on progress on MicroG?
08:00:04 <hobo8818[m]> Like when is it coming

08:03:18 <TheJollyRoger> hobo8818[m]: I'm sorry but I can't really commit to a firm date. It will come when more contributors step up to make a stub handler for Google services that have not been given a fallback happen.

08:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> I should stress again: GrapheneOS is not a business where you put money in and get a phone back, but rather it aims to be a collaborative open source project without a profit/monetization model. It depends on the contributions from its community to work.
08:05:36 <TheJollyRoger> If the project had enough assets it might be possible to put a bounty on certain issues, since that actually worked well for the Web Installer, but I cannot give you an ETA, since GrapheneOS is not a business or a corporation or company. It's a collaboration.
08:07:41 <hobo8818[m]> <TheJollyRoger "hobo8818: I'm sorry but I can't "> Okey thank you :) I dont know how to code so cant really help that way but will donate

09:24:35 <hobo0000[m]> For me on 4a rebooting device allows me to take about 3 photos and than breaks again and have ro reboot.. Havent found sollution
09:26:51 <certainindividua> Hmmm. That doesn't sound great. I'll try some more things and report back if I find anything.
09:32:10 <hobo0000[m]> I think I saw people reporting this problem on githubs issuetracker tho. That 4a camera isnt working
09:33:19 <certainindividua> Weird. It has been working for months now.
09:38:11 <certainindividua> It was a sensor permission thing in my case. Thought I checked all permissions. Geez. I'm sorry.
09:41:03 <hobo0000[m]> Not for me.. The camera app has all permissions but it wont work. Neither does the Signals camera
09:44:51 <certainindividua> Aww that sucks. I had all permissions set up, but Sensors just blanket over all those.

11:23:12 <hobo0000[m]> <joeski "Hey guys, what information does "> None
11:23:12 <strcat[m]> but rather just bullshits nonstop
11:23:12 <strcat[m]> so, don't do that anymore, don't get info from clueless YouTube influencers
11:23:49 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have microG and microG is not really 'anonymized' anyway
11:24:01 <strcat[m]> if that is what you are thinking, we don't include that
11:24:22 <strcat[m]> there's a whole section on the site documenting the default connections
11:24:37 <strcat[m]> once you put in a SIM and connect to a mobile network there are also connections to your carrier
11:24:46 <strcat[m]> but that's not default and that's fairly straightforward
11:25:00 <strcat[m]> some carriers may host their stuff on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. - that's a carrier choice thing

11:31:24 <strcat> yes

11:32:48 <rny> somenerd[m]: how do you brick a pixel
11:32:59 <rny> if anyone has bricked a pixel, please teach me how to brick one
11:33:05 <strcat> rny: soft bricking usually
11:33:05 <somenerd[m]> more like soft brick ig
11:33:15 <rny> what does soft bricking even mean?
11:33:18 <strcat> but it can hard brick if you flash corrupt bootloader

11:33:34 <rny> why'd anyone change the boot slot is beyond me
11:33:49 <somenerd[m]> I mean, I don't think most people know cli
11:33:52 <somenerd[m]> or bootloaders
11:33:54 <rny> cant people read the fucking cli commands?
11:34:03 <somenerd[m]> they just see a "trusted" person

12:36:57 <alex-resist> Hey folks, is it correct that the latest update (Pixel 3a XL, stable) is huge (778MB) and the download is stuttering? I thought it was just a Vanadium update
12:38:50 <mynacol[m]> <alex-resist "Hey folks, is it correct that th"> You probably didn't get the delta update. For more info see here https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates

12:40:19 <alex-resist> bonito-ota_update-2021.02.06.05.zip is 778 MB
12:45:12 <take_a_deep_brea> yep they were big . for some reason .
12:45:25 <take_a_deep_brea> sunfish here .
12:47:23 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the incrementals weren't deployed right
12:47:27 <strcat[m]> that's all
12:47:43 <strcat[m]> and was too late for downloads that already started

12:49:36 <strcat[m]> nothing odd or unusual
12:49:49 <mynacol[m]> In other words: ota update != delta update
12:49:49 <alex-resist> Will clear the app data and retry the update
12:49:54 <strcat[m]> the incrementals didn't get deployed due to a connection that died
12:50:20 <strcat[m]> there are 1000+ downloads going of the full updates so yeah you can expect it to take some time
12:50:22 <strcat[m]> not unusual
12:50:35 <strcat[m]> deltas are not always going to be provided, and some updates the deltas will be large
12:50:45 <strcat[m]> and if you miss an update there generally won't be a delta
12:51:00 <strcat[m]> you've just gotten used to us always making deltas for current-1 to current
12:51:03 <strcat[m]> and staying up-to-date
12:51:20 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah , lmao
12:51:41 <strcat[m]> the intention was to provide deltas for this update and they were generated but the upload connection died
12:51:53 <alex-resist> Ok, after clearing the seamless update client data and restarting the update, it's (quite literally) downloading 100 times faster. I guess this is now the correct file size
12:51:59 <strcat[m]> and no one mentioned it for beta
12:52:07 <strcat[m]> alex-resist:  same speed, it's just a much smaller file
12:52:19 <strcat[m]> the delta wasn't available before, now it is
12:52:22 <strcat[m]> either way it's correct
12:52:35 <strcat[m]> there are deltas for the past 2 releases to current
12:52:44 <strcat[m]> but again, they weren't available when this was pushed to beta and then stable
12:53:03 <strcat[m]> stuff needs to be reported when it's in beta, not stable, it's just an optimization so it doesn't matter though
12:53:26 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: there's absolutely no guarantee that we provide deltas
12:54:08 <alex-resist> strcat that's fine, it's just the first time the update took so long. Especially with a seemingly small update
12:55:31 <alex-resist> Now it's already finished, I can restart and enjoy my Vanadium :)
12:55:56 <strcat[m]> it's working through all the downloads
12:56:00 <strcat[m]> just an unfortunate missed optimization
12:56:02 <strcat[m]> not a big deal
12:56:54 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: once it starts downloading a full update (if incremental isn't available) it won't abandon that and switch to incremental
12:57:05 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: could have written it to do that but didn't
12:57:16 <alex-resist> It's probably a good load test for the server
12:57:41 <strcat[m]> yeah 2000+ downloads of an 800M file concurrently
12:57:46 <strcat[m]> oh well
12:58:09 <hobo0000[m]> Nice xd
12:58:14 <strcat[m]> the incrementals are finished being deployed now so anyone starting to download it from one of the past 2 releases now will get the incrementals
12:58:43 <alex-resist> Also, thank you for creating this update in the first place. That Chromium bug seemed too important to ignore
12:58:51 <strcat[m]>  * yeah 2000+ concurrent downloads of an 800M file
12:59:05 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: usually Chromium security updates are only every 6 weeks
12:59:17 <strcat[m]> this was different
12:59:42 <strcat[m]> it's not more dangerous than the usual fixed vulnerabilities but rather the difference is it was found being exploited in the wild
13:01:00 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the releases server has 2gbit bandwidth so it's fine
13:01:17 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we could add a 2nd one (or more) if needed
13:01:37 <strcat[m]> seems to be a good indication that even without incrementals the current server would be fine
13:14:40 <alex-resist> 2000 downloads on a 2 GBit connection leaves 1 Mbit per download, which is not exactly thrilling for a 800MB file. The question is how rapidly these updates should be deployed. If the goal is that everyone should receive the update within 24 hours, it's perfectly fine. If everyone should be able to receive it within one hour, it's not possible *this* time. But it's probably also wasted money to rent more servers that are only used
13:14:41 <alex-resist>  once or twice a month. I get it, it's a bit complicated
13:15:23 <strcat[m]> there are incrementals deployed now anyway
13:15:39 <strcat[m]> if people would have mentioned it during the beta (yesterday) I'd have finished the deployment
13:15:44 <strcat[m]> you brought it up too late
13:16:26 <mynacol[m]> Switched back to beta. Maybe I can catch some problems in the future
13:16:28 <take_a_deep_brea> as an aside , alex-resist: you have no idea how thrilling even 1Mbit per download can be . beleive me , lmao .
13:16:41 <alex-resist> I understand. Ideally I would have an additional device permanently on beta, but currently it's not possible :/
13:17:07 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we could add more of these 2gbit servers
13:17:20 <strcat[m]> they are like $40/month each or something
13:17:27 <strcat[m]> just easier to have 1
13:18:29 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: there were probably more concurrent downloads at peak
13:18:32 <strcat[m]> dunno
13:19:10 <strcat[m]> down to ~600 now and the newer ones are larger incrementals so they go much faster
13:20:13 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the server could reboot every 5 mins and ppl would still download it just fine - the update client is very robust
13:20:52 <strcat[m]> 3+ years ago we didn't use incrementals regularly at all
13:21:06 <strcat[m]> consider it a throwback
13:21:20 <strcat[m]> and OVH didn't used to offer more than 100mbit for a VPS
13:21:28 <strcat[m]> so imagine that
13:21:43 <alex-resist> I see I see
13:21:51 <alex-resist> We're discussing issues on a high level
13:21:52 <strcat[m]> they added the higher bandwidth tiers in 2020
13:22:09 <alex-resist> The infrastructure would have handled it fine without any further action, so that's a big plus
13:22:21 <strcat[m]> yes incrementals are just an optimization
13:22:23 <strcat[m]> not guaranteed
13:22:29 <strcat[m]> if you turn off your phone for a month
13:22:33 <strcat[m]> you're not getting an incremental
13:22:48 <strcat[m]> it's for `current - 1` to `current`
13:22:51 <strcat[m]> generally
13:22:58 <mynacol[m]> I think the current resources suffice. The 40$ can be spend better IMO
13:23:02 <strcat[m]> this time we did both `current - 2` and `current - 1` to `current`
13:23:08 <mynacol[m]> * I think the current resources suffice. The 40$ can be spent better IMO
13:23:13 <strcat[m]> so it's kinda a shame that they didn't get fully deployed
13:23:18 <strcat[m]> they actually got 100% uploaded
13:23:45 <alex-resist> strcat do you happen to know if the stock Pixels already got that Chromium update?
13:23:49 <strcat[m]> but then as the script was hashing them to check that it uploaded properly it died and I didn't notice, that's all
13:23:59 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: Chrome is updated via Play Store like other apps
13:24:05 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: they do staged rollouts usually
13:24:10 <strcat[m]> dunno if they made an exception for this
13:24:20 <strcat[m]> it usually takes a LONG time for them to push out the updates to everyone
13:24:57 <giffgaff[m]> Hi all, does Graphene OS provide any protection against active IMSI catchers? Or is there any settings OS settings to change to improve self defence against active IMSI attack
13:27:52 <mynacol[m]> <giffgaff[m] "Hi all, does Graphene OS provide"> This page answers some of your questions https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
13:28:06 <mynacol[m]> Feel free to follow-up
13:30:30 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: use encrypted communications not legacy insecure calls and texts
13:31:00 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: the LTE only mode feature offered by GrapheneOS is for attack surface reduction and LTE does NOT make it so that you should trust networks
13:31:36 <strcat[m]> LTE is not secure and networks should not be trusted, you shouldn't be assuming that if you make an unencrypted call that travels through multiple carriers, etc. that it is private
13:31:46 <strcat[m]> use encrypted communications
13:32:04 <strcat[m]> end-to-end encryption is ideal but transport encryption is enough to avoid trusting networks
13:45:16 <giffgaff[m]> From my window i have been watching the police come and go. I have seen them deploying something that looks like a IMSI catcher. They leave it in the boot of a car. I  see them coming in them coming and going to the car.
13:46:00 <mynacol[m]> giffgaff: Then you should consider turning on airplane mode
13:46:21 <giffgaff[m]> Airplane mode is turned on
13:48:06 <giffgaff[m]> Please see this video and let me know what you think?
13:49:37 <badactor[m]> Where is the video?
13:51:03 <giffgaff[m]> Hold on
13:57:05 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: networks are already insecure
13:57:05 <strcat[m]> as I said
13:57:06 <strcat[m]> use encryption
13:57:21 <strcat[m]> if you're sending data in the clear over networks it's already not private
13:58:08 <strcat[m]> don't use traditional calls and texts, they aren't secure
13:58:11 <strcat[m]> the solution is not using them
13:58:17 <strcat[m]> use Signal or Matrix
13:58:42 <strcat[m]> if someone won't install Signal to talk to you they aren't worth talking to anyway
13:59:13 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
14:02:54 <somenerd[m]> I mean, use encrypted texts
14:03:11 <somenerd[m]> that's the most suggested defense here afaict
14:04:01 <alex-resist> strcat could a mode be implemented in addition to LTE-only that is "data-only"?
14:04:38 <alex-resist> Not sure if the modem would play along though
14:05:26 <alex-resist> A mode that would protect against accidental phone calls and silent SMS
14:06:14 <strcat[m]> VoLTE is already 'data only'
14:06:15 <somenerd[m]> ?
14:06:16 <somenerd[m]> you mean Wi-Fi only?
14:06:19 <giffgaff[m]> Hold on I'm going to have to use another phone to record the screen. When I'm using android for screen recording the videos all black
14:06:44 <strcat[m]> why record the screen?
14:07:00 <alex-resist> strcat it's more about not receiving stuff. Completely deactivating legacy telephony and SMS
14:07:18 <strcat[m]> VoLTE uses data
14:07:20 <strcat[m]> it's VOIP basically
14:07:26 <Preload[m]> <alex-resist "strcat could a mode be implement"> Isn't LTE-only mode data only?
14:07:28 <strcat[m]>  * it's VOIP
14:07:48 <strcat[m]> the issue is you're trusting the networks
14:08:00 <alex-resist> Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Can a phone in LTE-only mode not receive SMS?
14:08:08 <strcat[m]> you can see the network connections that VoLTE, RCS, etc. make
14:08:19 <strcat[m]> a lot of the carriers just host that stuff via AWS / Google
14:08:27 <somenerd[m]> I'm seriously confused, wdym "data-only"?
14:08:35 <somenerd[m]> only using cellular networks?
14:08:59 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so, when using LTE to send texts and make calls
14:09:00 <alex-resist> somenerd: deactivating legacy telephony and SMS completely. Only allowing data connections via LTE.
14:09:02 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: that's SIP
14:09:14 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: texts and calls via LTE are data
14:09:19 <strcat[m]> you can see the connections
14:09:20 <somenerd[m]> isn't that just LTE-only?
14:09:28 <alex-resist> strcat Ok that's good to know, I did not know that
14:09:34 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: LTE only mode gets rid of all the legacy nonsense already
14:09:46 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: but those are still cell network based calls and texts
14:09:55 <alex-resist> I thought a phone in LTE-only mode could still receive legacy SMS, but apparently my knowledge is limited
14:10:05 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it can receive SMS, via SIP
14:10:31 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: LTE texts and calls are data
14:10:47 <alex-resist> Ok, to be more precise: would silent SMS still work with LTE-only? Or are silent SMS a legacy thing
14:10:56 <strcat[m]> so when you enable LTE only mode if you don't have working IMS, VoLTE, etc. you can't make/receive texts/calls
14:11:13 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: SMS still works with LTE only mode
14:11:20 <strcat[m]> don't understand why you're bringing up silent SMS suddenly
14:11:42 <strcat[m]> silent SMS just means marking a message as a no-op basically
14:11:46 <alex-resist> strcat because it would be desirable to deactivate SMS completely
14:11:51 <strcat[m]> why
14:12:07 <alex-resist> Well, as the other person said above, to force someone to use e.g. Signal
14:12:13 <alex-resist> No accidental phone calls, no SMS
14:12:17 <strcat[m]> you can disable the Messaging app
14:12:18 <somenerd[m]> use Wi-Fi only or something
14:12:25 <somenerd[m]> why a "data-only" mode
14:12:26 <strcat[m]> texts and calls can work via Wi-Fi
14:12:35 <strcat[m]> LTE only is data only mode
14:12:45 <strcat[m]> LTE text and calls are via data
14:12:45 <somenerd[m]> yeah, afaict it is
14:12:56 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: VoLTE is SIP, SMS via LTE is SIP
14:12:59 <strcat[m]> it's VOIP
14:13:03 <strcat[m]> VOIP via carriers
14:13:21 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode is data only mode
14:13:32 <strcat[m]> the point of it is attack surface reduction
14:13:44 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we could offer the option to disable texts, calls, etc.
14:13:50 <strcat[m]> you essentially have that at a high level
14:13:52 <strcat[m]> disable Messaging app
14:13:52 <alex-resist> strcat Ok, that's actually good to know. I'm using LTE-only mode all the time, I just never noticed because I never use my phone as a phone.
14:14:10 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you wouldn't notice - if you have working VoLTE it all works fine
14:14:30 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: a VoLTE call doesn't appear any different to a user other than not having terrible quality audio
14:14:47 <strcat[m]> if you have working VoLTE + LTE then it's using VoLTE whether or not you have LTE only mode enabled
14:15:03 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode disables using protocols older than LTE, which means all texts/calls are via data
14:15:23 <strcat[m]> without LTE only mode, if you have LTE but not VoLTE, it falls back to 3G for calls
14:15:25 <alex-resist> Ok so one way to protect against accidentally sending SMS is disabling the messaging app, which obviously makes sense. But you could still receive SMS, right?
14:15:43 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I mean, you can 'receive' them but you won't have an app for it
14:16:05 <strcat[m]> basically, it's not clear to me what you want to do
14:16:17 <strcat[m]> we could offer morea toggles for stuff for lowering attack surface further
14:16:18 <alex-resist> I wonder if it's possible to block incoming calls and SMS, even when using VoLTE
14:16:25 <strcat[m]>  * we could offer more toggles for stuff for lowering attack surface further
14:16:37 <alex-resist> Sorry, it took a while to understand the situation with LTE-only mode :/
14:16:40 <strcat[m]> the thing is to use Signal you need to have the ability to receive texts or calls
14:16:49 <strcat[m]> since it has to confirm the number
14:17:09 <alex-resist> strcat but Signal needs that only once. It could temporarily be allowed to activate Signal and then deactivated again
14:17:30 <noobna[m]> <strcat[m] "alex-resist: we could offer the "> That would be good😄
14:17:55 <strcat[m]> we could add more toggles to disable stuff but our focus will be on stuff that can be disabled by default or at least that many people would want to disable
14:18:22 <alex-resist> strcat I see, I should add that I'm really happy with LTE-only mode already
14:18:27 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you could probably disable IMS / VoLTE if you want to break being able to do calls/texts
14:18:39 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode + disable VoLTE and you won't have working calls
14:18:53 <alex-resist> strcat yes, that's what I had in mind, I just wasn't able to phrase it properly
14:18:59 <strcat[m]> (and VoWiFi but chances are you don't have working VoWiFi anyway, and both are IMS/SIP)
14:20:19 <alex-resist> I wasn't aware that LTE-only + no VoLTE might be exactly what I was looking for
14:21:47 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem
14:22:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: LTE texts, calls, etc. are all data-based via IMS
14:22:15 <strcat[m]> (LTE and later)
14:22:41 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so, essentially, disabling IMS + using LTE only gets you what you want
14:22:48 <strcat[m]> there is probably already a way to disable IMS
14:23:36 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: SMS for LTE, RCS, VoLTE, VoWiFi are all IMS-based
14:23:42 <strcat[m]> all normal data, you can see the connections being made
14:24:04 <strcat[m]> you can see a lot of carriers are just using Google's hosting for RCS, etc.
14:24:20 <strcat[m]> dunno why RCS even exists but whatever
14:24:47 <strcat[m]> makes more sense to me to abandon carrier-based texts / calls than making a new standard adding fancy stuff
14:25:49 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so, for the LTE and up world, there's only data, the difference is whether you use IMS for carrier-based communications vs. app-based stuff (Signal, Matrix, etc.)
14:26:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: IMS-based texts/calls are literally just SIP
14:26:39 <alex-resist> Ok, thanks a lot, so much stuff to read/think about
14:26:42 <duck[m]> Is VoWiFi a better choice than leaving the cellular radio on
14:27:04 <alex-resist> To me it feels that mobile telephony was a huge mistake from the beginning and we are only now starting to fix it
14:27:08 <strcat[m]> it's not any more secure of a communications mechanism
14:27:27 <strcat[m]> duck: VoWiFi still trusts the carrier networks, if you want secure calls use an end-to-end encrypted app
14:27:54 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi and cellular are both implemented in different sandboxes on the baseband
14:28:51 <strcat[m]> the advantage of Wi-Fi is that it can be more anonymous
14:28:57 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
14:29:21 <strcat[m]> duck: since our recommendation is to avoid carrier-based texts and calls, I can't recommend VoWiFi
14:29:29 <strcat[m]> use Signal or Matrix for calls
14:29:34 <strcat[m]> Signal for regular folks
14:29:54 <alex-resist> So, best solution for people who don't need anonymity is GrapheneOS + Signal + LTE-only + VoLTE deactivated (except for registering Signal)
14:30:23 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: disabling VoLTE probably doesn't disable SMS via IMS
14:30:28 <strcat[m]> you probably want to disable IMS as a whole
14:30:43 <alex-resist> strcat I see, so there is one step missing
14:30:46 <strcat[m]> IMS provides data-based calls, SMS, RCS, etc.
14:30:58 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if you disable IMS then VoLTE is gone
14:31:06 <strcat[m]> and VoWiFi
14:31:29 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it's simpler to just think of it as IMS-based (carrier) services vs. app-based services
14:31:38 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if 2G/3G are out of the picture that's all there is
14:31:49 <alex-resist> I do have several Pixel 3a here, but unfortunately no additional SIM card. I'd really be interested in trying such things
14:31:52 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: and IMS isn't strictly via cellular
14:31:54 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it works via Wi-Fi
14:32:03 <strcat[m]> you can text and call via carrier networks using Wi-Fi
14:32:44 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: that largely doesn't work on GrapheneOS because they tend to require carrier bloatware for Wi-Fi stuff
14:33:02 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: but, in theory, it works, and on the stock OS it's more widely available thanks to having carrier bloatware apps
14:33:39 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: cellular vs. Wi-Fi doesn't really impact whether you can use carrier-based texts/calls anymore when they implement all this stuff
14:33:46 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: cellular is data, Wi-Fi is data
14:33:50 <strcat[m]> IMS uses data
14:33:55 <strcat[m]> it's just SIP.
14:34:48 <alex-resist> Apart from the functionality aspect, IMS also seems like a big attack surface
14:34:48 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it's perfectly modern technology, the issue is depending on carriers to provide these services and *trusting* them since it has no E2E encryption
14:35:30 <alex-resist> Although IMS code quality is probably still much better than 2G/3G
14:35:31 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: Signal is a lot of attack surface too (WebRTC in particular)
14:35:46 <somenerd[m]> hmm
14:35:59 <alex-resist> strcat oof good point
14:36:11 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
14:36:13 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/ims/+/refs/heads/master/rcs/
14:36:20 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it's largely Java
14:36:39 <noobna[m]> Is it possible to have only cell and WiFi data and normal calls and SMS blocked?
14:36:39 <noobna[m]> For making a signal account can be done on a dumbphone still to get the code
14:37:05 <strcat[m]> noobna: LTE only mode is data only mode
14:37:15 <strcat[m]> as explained above
14:37:19 <strcat[m]> you still have carrier-based calls and texts if your carrier supports IMS (data-based calls and texts)
14:37:26 <strcat[m]> recommend reading through the conversation above
14:37:32 <strcat[m]> you can disable IMS
14:41:33 <strcat[m]> if you want to think of it this way, it's a federated communications network (carriers) with bridges to legacy networks - the issue with the whole thing is lack of end-to-end encryption so you're trusting these carriers and their security
14:41:42 <illustratorius[m> Using Graphene OS and I love it. I'm trying to get away from all things google. I discovered that many apps use google analytics for tracking crashes. Is this something that tracks my phone and information?
14:41:48 <strcat[m]> that's why we strongly recommend using end-to-end encrypted calls/texts
14:42:01 <strcat[m]> illustratorius: apps are sandboxed, not clear what you mean by tracking your phone and information
14:42:18 <strcat[m]> illustratorius: recommend reading about how the application model and permission / access grant systems work
14:42:43 <noobna[m]> <strcat[m] "you still have carrier-based cal"> I don't have LTE mode we have 4g 3g 2g only in the option here
14:42:44 <noobna[m]> Just thought would be good to have calls and SMS blocked and only use the sim for data
14:42:49 <alex-resist> Slightly offtopic, but is Signal using WebRTC only for video calls or for everything? If they're using it for normal calls, it seems like a regression in terms of attack surface
14:42:50 <strcat[m]> illustratorius: apps also definitely don't use google analytics for tracking crashes, you're mixing things up
14:43:03 <strcat[m]> noobna: so set '4G only'
14:43:09 <strcat[m]> noobna: your carrier prefers calling LTE 4G
14:43:16 <strcat[m]> same thing
14:43:30 <strcat[m]> the OS respects what the carrier wants to call it
14:43:39 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: for voice/video calls
14:43:59 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: RedPhone didn't use WebRTC, Signal uses it for voice calls too
14:44:07 <alex-resist> strcat crap ok
14:45:11 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it used to use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP and more traditional VOIP
14:45:17 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: moved to Signal protocol + WebRTC
14:45:59 <noobna[m]> <strcat[m] "the OS respects what the carrier"> I had 4g only mode on and was still reciveing msgs tho
14:46:16 <strcat[m]> noobna: yes, as I said, LTE only mode is data only mode
14:46:35 <strcat[m]> noobna: and carriers supporting modern technology have data-based calls and texts
14:46:46 <strcat[m]> so carrier-based calls and texts should still work fine in LTE only mode
14:46:48 <alex-resist> noobna I also just learned this, LTE-only does not deactivate SMS
14:47:06 <strcat[m]> it disables 2G/3G
14:47:06 <noobna[m]> Ah OK got cha😅
14:47:13 <strcat[m]> SMS via IMS still works
14:47:18 <strcat[m]> i.e. SMS via SIP
14:47:41 <strcat[m]> and similarly, VoLTE and VoWiFi still work
14:47:43 <strcat[m]> explained this above
14:48:07 <strcat[m]> disabling 2G/3G is a different thing than disabling carrier-based communication services
14:48:16 <strcat[m]> the combination of disabling 2G/3G and disabling IMS would do that
14:48:24 <strcat[m]> since LTE and up use IMS for that stuff
14:48:29 <alex-resist> So much bloat everywhere, just to appeal to mainstream users :)
14:48:30 <strcat[m]> went through all this
14:48:42 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: IMS isn't that bad it's just SIP
14:48:59 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if you weren't concerned about privacy / end-to-end encryption it's not like you'd care
14:49:21 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you probably get better audio quality with it than Signal
14:49:37 <strcat[m]> it's modern... but not private
14:49:57 <strcat[m]> we recommend against carrier-based calls/texts because of privacy
14:50:01 <alex-resist> Why is noone creating a "unified messaging system" that also features e2e?
14:50:15 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: well in theory RCS is supposed to have E2E encryption but...
14:50:33 <strcat[m]> why would you want to keep using carrier-based texting?
14:50:37 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m > <@freenode_alex-resist:matrix.org> Why is noone creating a "unified messaging system" that also features e2e?
14:50:37 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m waves from the Matrix side of the bridge
14:50:38 <strcat[m]> even if it has fancy features and E2E encryption?
14:51:00 <strcat[m]> do you really want to be limited by what your carrier feels like supporting and to be stuck using their servers?
14:51:17 <alex-resist> Such a unified system would not be confined to a carrier
14:51:24 <mynacol[m]> BTW you may block messaging on your end, but most users won't get an information that the SMS does not get received (there are delivery receipts, but they are probably off by default).
14:51:24 <mynacol[m]> So people can still send you messages
14:51:31 <alex-resist> It would be a universal standard that apps could also use as a basis
14:52:12 <somenerd[m]> well, lots of protocols attempt that
14:52:20 <somenerd[m]> to varying levels of success
14:52:26 <take_a_deep_brea> <alex-resist "It would be a universal standard"> https://xkcd.com/927/
14:52:37 <somenerd[m]> LOL
14:52:47 <somenerd[m]> yeah that comic's a good example of what happens
14:52:53 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I mean, they're using SIP for SMS and calls, that's a 'universal standard', doesn't mean they will federate with you
14:53:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: RCS, etc. is a standard you can implement
14:53:05 <mynacol[m]> When can we deprecate E-Mail? 🙄
14:53:09 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean they are going to federate with you
14:53:13 <somenerd[m]> matrix tries, XMPP tries
14:53:15 <alex-resist> I see I see :)
14:53:44 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <mynacol[m] "When can we deprecate E-Mail? 🙄"> Never, it will haunt the Internet till the end of time
14:53:46 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: RCS wasn't made by Google but it is essentially Google's answer to iMessage and is meant to end up with E2E encryption
14:53:54 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: but both RCS and iMessage are stupid
14:54:38 <strcat[m]> iMessage is arguably a lot worse since at least with RCS every carrier is allowed to use it and federate
14:54:45 <strcat[m]> anyways
14:54:47 <strcat[m]> the whole thing is dumb
14:54:53 <strcat[m]> why would you want to have carrier-based messaging
14:55:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I don't see why you want something more than what's available
14:55:17 <strcat[m]> we really don't need more messaging standards
14:55:24 <strcat[m]> we're using one right now, this is fine, please no more
14:55:37 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
14:55:52 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Well, technically, we are using 2 right now :P
14:55:58 <somenerd[m]> I mean, yeah
14:56:09 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we don't have RCS really in GrapheneOS (we have OS support but not an RCS app, similar to eSIM)
14:56:20 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it probably makes sense for us to just remove the RCS apps
14:56:22 <somenerd[m]> but no one really uses those "universal protocols" yet
14:56:30 <strcat[m]>  * alex-resist: it probably makes sense for us to just remove the low-level OS RCS apps
14:56:41 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I don't want to support RCS, it's stupid
14:56:52 <somenerd[m]> > alex-resist: RCS wasn't made by Google but it is essentially Google's answer to iMessage and is meant to end up with E2E encryption
14:56:52 <somenerd[m]> google has too many messaging apps
14:57:06 <strcat[m]> somenerd: RCS is an open standard
14:57:12 <strcat[m]> somenerd: not a specific app
14:57:12 <mynacol[m]> <strcat[m] "alex-resist: I don't want to sup"> Kill it before people depend on it!
14:57:26 <strcat[m]> somenerd: Android Messages supports RCS (NOT the AOSP Messaging app atm)
14:57:33 <strcat[m]> it looks like they are adding full RCS support to AOSP
14:57:41 <strcat[m]> mynacol: ppl can't depend on it
14:57:42 <somenerd[m]> similar to SMS?
14:57:45 <strcat[m]> I can't see Apple implementing RCS
14:57:50 <strcat[m]> somenerd: RCS is just modern SMS
14:57:51 <somenerd[m]> yeah
14:58:15 <strcat[m]> somenerd: SMS already functions via IMS (data-based), RCS is a new messaging standard with rich text, long messages and so on
14:58:15 <somenerd[m]> I mean, Apple would prefer to do away with SMS as well
14:58:26 <somenerd[m]> it's just that everyone uses it
14:58:27 <strcat[m]> yeah but RCS does not let you drop SMS
14:58:34 <strcat[m]> ppl will not just suddenly not have SMS anymore
14:58:41 <strcat[m]> and RCS is still carrier-based messaging
14:58:47 <strcat[m]> it's possible for carriers to simply delegate RCS to Google
14:58:50 <strcat[m]> T-Mobile does that, etc.
14:59:01 <hobo0000[m]> Damn you write fast strcat
14:59:47 <strcat[m]> somenerd: a lot of carriers are getting increasingly less interested in hosting this kind of stuff
14:59:50 <strcat[m]> and are just delegating it to Google
15:02:26 <strcat[m]> someone was recently complaining about it because T-Mobile uses Google for RCS, etc.
15:02:33 <strcat[m]> that is true whether or not you use Android
15:02:38 <strcat[m]> it's just how they choose to host it
15:03:33 <strcat[m]> anyway think about how much spam there is via SMS and now imagine if it was an open network anyone could federate with
15:19:54 <Emvista[m]> Will using multiple users have the same affect as using insular/shelter to set up a work profile?
15:20:37 <Emvista[m]> I need to use social media for my brand, and don't want them to sabotage my personal information.
15:20:45 <jakewise[m]> install question>>>
15:20:59 <strcat[m]> Emvista: user profiles each have their own encryption keys and are controlled by you, not an app
15:21:05 <caffiene[m]> Do I need to do anything special when my phone has the seamless update client pop up on pixel 4a?
15:21:14 <jakewise[m]> Can I use a Mac to walk through the Install instructions?
15:21:37 <Emvista[m]> <strcat[m] "Emvista: user profiles each have"> Good to know
15:21:39 <strcat[m]> caffiene: wait for it to install and then reboot when it tells you to - nothing will break if you reboot prematurely but it'll have to resume the download (or restart the install)
15:22:02 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
15:22:09 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
15:22:13 <caffiene[m]> So is that just an android update?
15:25:18 <mynacol[m]> jakewise: If not already, please follow exclusively the official installation guide https://grapheneos.org/install/ . Using other videos/guides has led to bricking devices, so be warned.
15:25:57 <strcat[m]> caffiene: it's a GrapheneOS update
15:26:04 <strcat[m]> caffiene: it's GrapheneOS, not Android, not really clear what you mean
15:26:20 <Emvista[m]> Web install was a piece of cake
15:26:24 <jakewise[m]> <mynacol[m] "jakewise: If not already, please"> Yes, that's that I'm using. IN the "Connecting the phone" section, it only refers to Linux or Windows
15:26:31 <caffiene[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I got ya, I just read what it said on the website
15:26:41 <Emvista[m]> Even easier than flashing calyx
15:26:44 <strcat[m]> caffiene: https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
15:26:45 <mynacol[m]> And about your original question: Any PC/Mac is fine. Just follow the web installer
15:26:47 <strcat[m]> has the release notes
15:27:56 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <jakewise[m] "Yes, that's that I'm using. IN t"> On macOS you just connect the phone, Linux and Windows are listed there, because they may have extra steps
15:28:44 <jakewise[m]> <mynacol[m] "And about your original question"> Thanks.
15:29:28 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yes, in the browser
15:29:31 <jakewise[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "On macOS you just connect the ph"> Thanks.
15:29:53 <strcat[m]> jakewise: yes it uses WebUSB to flash the OS on the phone from the browser
15:30:13 <strcat[m]> it will ask you to select a USB device and grant the web page access to it
15:30:58 <strcat[m]> you have to confirm unlocking on the phone and then confirm locking at the end
15:31:05 <strcat[m]> all covered there
15:31:08 <strcat[m]> it's really quite easy
15:31:19 <strcat[m]> the main issue people have is using unreliable / broken USB cables
15:31:38 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "jakewise: yes it uses WebUSB to "> Cool. I have an unlocked phone, but outside of the steps (like Enabling OEM unlocking) that explicitly are noted as doing something on the phone, everything else will be: browser-based and through the USB.
15:31:49 <strcat[m]> if you're on a Mac then I assume you have a USB-C port and can use the cable that comes with the phone so not an issue
15:32:00 <strcat[m]> jakewise: yes
15:32:11 <strcat[m]> jakewise: all you need is a browser with WebUSB support like Chrome, Brave, Edge, etc.
15:32:15 <strcat[m]> jakewise: no other software
15:32:41 <strcat[m]> we have our own JavaScript-based implementation of fastboot
15:32:44 <strcat[m]> so no need for anything else
15:33:01 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "the main issue people have is us"> This is my primary concern. I do *not* have a USB C (older mac), but have a A-C port converter and the factor cable from the Pixel 4a
15:33:18 <strcat[m]> jakewise: make sure to use a reliable USB-A to USB-C cable then
15:33:26 <strcat[m]> high quality one
15:33:51 <strcat[m]> jakewise: if you have another Android phone you could do the flashing from there, technically, although it takes substantially longer
15:34:52 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "jakewise: make sure to use a rel"> I don't have one of those, but I have regular USB 2.0 to USB C + the factory cable.
15:35:10 <strcat[m]> jakewise: if it's actually a proper cable it will work
15:35:28 <strcat[m]> jakewise: if it's something like an Anker cable it's going to work
15:35:32 <strcat[m]> if it's some sketchy off brand one, probably not
15:35:41 <strcat[m]> it won't brick the phone
15:35:50 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "jakewise: if it's actually a pro"> Is the USB-C cable that came in the box
15:36:04 <strcat[m]> the USB-C cable that comes with it is great but that's USB-C to USB-C
15:36:18 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <jakewise[m] "Is the USB-C cable that came in "> And the adapter?
15:36:18 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "jakewise: if it's something like"> It's not a cable, is just a port converter.
15:36:25 <strcat[m]> the converter it comes with is fine too but I doubt you have a cable you can plug into that
15:36:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> > <@jakewise:matrix.org> Is the USB-C cable that came in the box
15:36:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m>  * And the USB-C to USB-A adapter?
15:36:46 <strcat[m]> unless you actually have a USB-A to USB-A cable I don't see how you could use that
15:37:16 <strcat[m]> jakewise: if you don't have a device you can connect the USB-C cable to (you COULD use another Android phone to flash this one), then you need a cable for this
15:37:22 <strcat[m]> you need a cable for connecting it to your computer
15:37:25 <jakewise[m]> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079LYHNSR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
15:37:36 <jakewise[m]> ^ that is the port converter
15:37:45 <jakewise[m]> Sorry.. not advertizing
15:37:54 <strcat[m]> jakewise: it's worth trying
15:37:59 <strcat[m]> just be aware it may be garbage that doesn't work properly
15:38:06 <strcat[m]> so you may need to get another cable to complete the install
15:38:58 <mynacol[m]> In the meantime you won't have a functioning device (probably) so don't depend on it
15:39:59 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "so you may need to get another c"> Understood.
15:40:08 <loxerat[m]> sry for asking again but does the newest release mean that pixel 4 5G is supported/works?
15:40:08 <loxerat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog

15:40:49 <take_a_deep_brea> loxerat:  i think that is totally experimental
15:40:50 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "it won't brick the phone"> Just wanted to confirm... if this port converter does not work, my phone will *not* be bricked, correct?
15:41:14 <strcat[m]> jakewise: it likely won't have an OS to boot but it's extremely unlikely it would be *bricked*
15:41:22 <strcat[m]> jakewise: you'd just need to get a working cable and complete installing the OS
15:41:24 <jakewise[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> so you may need to get another cable to complete the install
15:41:24 <jakewise[m]>  * Understood.
15:41:24 <jakewise[m]> edit: just ordered.
15:41:46 <jakewise[m]> <strcat[m] "jakewise: you'd just need to get"> Cool.
15:41:59 <strcat[m]> jakewise: I don't think we've ever seen someone brick a device for real due to any issue like that
15:42:08 <strcat[m]> jakewise: what's pretty common is a cable that's flaky and drops connection
15:42:11 <strcat[m]> which cannot brick the device
15:42:21 <strcat[m]> but it would interrupt the install and it wouldn't be possible to finish
15:42:30 <strcat[m]> so there wouldn't be any fully installed OS
15:42:40 <strcat[m]> but that's not a problem can just flash it again with a working cable
15:43:07 <strcat[m]> that could happen if your web browser crashed,  cable got yanked out, etc. anyway - it's safe, just have to complete the install properly
15:43:17 <strcat[m]>  * that could happen if your web browser crashed,  cable got yanked out, etc. anyway - it's safe, just have to complete the install properly from the beginning of the flashing again
15:49:38 <take_a_deep_brea> nice.
15:50:43 <strcat[m]> what's not safe is following some third party video telling you to use a third party fastboot implementation
15:50:52 <strcat[m]> which may do things in an unsafe way and brick your phone for real
15:51:33 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
15:57:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <strcat[m] "what's not safe is following som"> Is this that techlore guy?  I have to say that after installing Graphene and spending time here his credibility is near zero at this point
15:57:45 <strcat[m]> yes, among others
15:58:01 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: he knows his video causes harm to our users
15:58:13 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: he is leaving it up out of spite even though it's wrong, always was wrong, and doesn't work properly
15:58:15 <strcat[m]> and bricks phones
15:58:29 <strcat[m]> he made a follow-up video that tells people to remove the safety check that someone ported to Windows for us
15:58:32 <strcat[m]> which checks the fastboot version
15:58:47 <strcat[m]> someone ported that to Windows for us, largely because of videos like this telling people to do things incorrectly
15:58:58 <strcat[m]> and he makes a follow-up video saying to edit the flashing script to delete the safety check
15:58:59 <strcat[m]> great
15:59:22 <strcat[m]> and that was before he was actually acting maliciously towards us and harassing developers
15:59:30 <somenerd[m]> amazing, clearly trustworthy and non-malicious behavior
15:59:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> 🤦‍♂️
15:59:44 <take_a_deep_brea> <strcat[m] "and he makes a follow-up video s"> a textbook example  of a pain in the ass
15:59:46 <strcat[m]> leaving up those videos continues causing harm to our users though
16:00:03 <somenerd[m]> he's done a bunch of other things
16:00:12 <somenerd[m]> including slightly hypocritical ones
16:01:13 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I honestly wondered if he was being paid to do this or if he was simply motivated personally
16:01:29 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: just has a grudge against us and that's how he is
16:03:02 <strcat[m]> if he cared at all about end users he'd take down the incorrect / dangerous videos
16:03:25 <strcat[m]> and if he was a decent person he'd stop spreading misinformation and trying to get people to harass me
16:03:32 <strcat[m]> go ahead and ask him if he'll do either
16:04:09 <strcat[m]>  * go ahead and ask him if he'll do any of that
16:04:15 <somenerd[m]> I mean, I asked him to change a few things in his Calyx vid...
16:04:25 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I think I would prefer to have as little contact with questionably ethical people as possible :p
16:05:12 <caffiene[m]> The video I originally followed was by (The Hated One)
16:07:37 <take_a_deep_brea> caffiene: The Hated One's video install is closer to official cli based  installation . but now the recommendation for most people is https://grapheneos.org/install/web
16:08:49 <caffiene[m]> take_a_deep_breath: yeah I messed mine up haha. So then I followed the official guide and someone here walked me through it. Very helpful community here
16:09:29 <mr_hebi_san[m]> This web based installer is impressive.  I used it, and while I do wish that the wording in the lock and unlock sections instructed a user to use the volume rocker and actually confirm on the phone instead of saying "you're unlocked" it was seamless
16:10:09 <strcat[m]> it does say to do that
16:10:19 <strcat[m]> it reports the status it gets from the phone though
16:10:28 <strcat[m]> some phones wait until the user actually unlocks to report back, others don't
16:11:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Huh.  I wonder why it didn't for me?  I already knew to look to the phone, so it wasn't a problem to me
16:11:12 <strcat[m]> it does say that
16:11:14 <strcat[m]> look at the page
16:11:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader
16:11:24 <strcat[m]> > The command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data. Use one of the volume keys to switch the selection to accepting it and the power button to confirm.
16:11:36 <strcat[m]> you got confused by it reporting the status of the command it asks the phone to do
16:11:59 <strcat[m]> it's not our choice that some phones say "OKAY" immediately in response to unlocking while others wait and report if it succeeded
16:12:12 <strcat[m]> depends on phone model
16:12:32 <strcat[m]> it's possible they gave up reporting success that way and expect you to run another command to see if it worked, don't know
16:13:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> That makes sense, and I understand the issues involved when you just have to work with the output of the phone itself
16:26:20 <mynacol[m]> strcat I just searched a bit around. With `fastboot oem device-info` you can get the current unlock status. Alternatively, fastboot may report that the bootloader is already unlocked by repeatedly sending `fastboot oem unlock` (untested).
16:26:20 <mynacol[m]> With cases for the different devices and the above methods, we could make the webinstaller even more intuitive.
16:26:41 <strcat[m]> mynacol: that's not how to do it
16:26:42 <strcat[m]> and that's outdated info
16:26:50 <strcat[m]> I know how to check the lock state
16:26:53 <mynacol[m]> Okay, sorry
16:27:36 <strcat[m]> we would need to work around the differences across devices
16:27:55 <strcat[m]> and it would be better for devices to behave consistently
16:29:32 <strcat[m]> 1st step would be figuring out how each device model behaves
16:29:45 <strcat[m]> it'd have to be hard-wired to handle them appropriately
16:29:50 <strcat[m]> not really worthwhile, I think
16:30:32 <somenerd[m]> I mean, would be nice to see if it's unlocked or not
16:30:36 <mynacol[m]> Well, I don't have the resources to test, have only a Pixel 4a
16:30:42 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it says on the phone
16:30:44 <strcat[m]> if it's unlocked
16:30:50 <somenerd[m]> oh wait lol
16:30:56 <somenerd[m]> then there's probably no need
16:31:11 <strcat[m]> they have a status line saying unlocked in red or locked in green
16:31:21 <strcat[m]> and we report a proper error
16:31:27 <somenerd[m]> maybe as a sort of frill, but nothing much more
16:31:28 <strcat[m]> if you don't unlock and try to flash
16:32:02 <strcat[m]> the way the devices return results for the unlock command is just inconsistent
16:32:08 <strcat[m]> some wait for confirmation then return result
16:32:26 <strcat[m]> others return success as meaning the prompt was triggered
16:32:57 <strcat[m]> and you'd have to check the lock state with the appropriate getvar command
16:32:58 <strcat[m]> not worth working around
16:32:58 <strcat[m]> it says how to confirm unlocking
16:33:24 <strcat[m]> the result message just thinks it unlocked already - it doesn't hide that text, it's still there, after the button and result text
16:33:58 <strcat[m]> none of the text that's there at the start is removed
16:34:10 <strcat[m]> results are shown after the buttons
16:34:20 <strcat[m]> so, right under the result for unlocking, it says how to confirm
16:35:28 <strcat[m]> basically what you're asking for is to have it wait and then check to see what the user did, to report to the user what they can see on the device screen - maybe worthwhile? but they can see it anyway
16:35:43 <strcat[m]> it's not worth it atm
16:35:47 <mynacol[m]> Alright. So its a minor nitpick
16:37:31 <somenerd[m]> mostly aesthetic
16:38:13 <strcat[m]> we did talk about it before when designing it
16:38:13 <somenerd[m]> since it shows no practical use, as strcat said
16:38:14 <strcat[m]> it just didn't seem worth doing atm
16:38:22 <somenerd[m]> makes sense
16:38:35 <somenerd[m]> would look sorta cool though imo
16:39:24 <strcat[m]> eventually plan is to have a fancier UI
16:39:33 <strcat[m]> kdrag0n has an early deployment of it
16:40:50 <somenerd[m]> cool
16:40:50 <pikaman[m]> Hey all, got an update today. Saw in the release announcements a rework of the network time updates. It doesn't seem to be immediately working over here, I have set it now manually. Is there something I should do?
16:41:52 <strcat[m]> pikaman: was it working before?
16:42:07 <pikaman[m]> Yes
16:42:27 <strcat[m]> so you set the time wrong and it's not working?
16:42:43 <strcat[m]> how did you test it and come to the conclusion it's not working, basically?
16:43:12 <strcat[m]> I just set my time wrong, then turned on network time and it fixed it
16:43:29 <pikaman[m]> Using network providing time sets it automatically back to 1st of January 1970
16:43:57 <strcat[m]> that sounds pretty change
16:44:03 <strcat[m]> and I don't really see how the change could cause that
16:44:23 <neoman54[m]> I had the same issue
16:44:41 <pikaman[m]> Is the use if network time immediately? Maybe I should wait for a bit
16:44:53 <strcat[m]> can you explain better what happened
16:44:58 <strcat[m]> you updated and it screwed up your time, or what?
16:45:05 <neoman54[m]> And I can't connect to the internet at all. via wifi or data
16:45:06 <faxing[m]> I updated this morning and don't have the bug for what it's worth
16:45:18 <strcat[m]> need a much clearer description of what happened, and what you did
16:46:32 <pikaman[m]> <strcat[m] "you updated and it screwed up yo"> Basically, it set it back to 1970. Did another reboot, but no change. To access the Internet I had to set the time manually.
16:46:51 <strcat[m]> pikaman: so you had network time enabled, and you updated, and your time got set back after the update?
16:46:59 <strcat[m]> very strange, and don't see how the change could cause that
16:47:08 <strcat[m]> it only changes how certificates are validated
16:47:14 <pikaman[m]> <strcat[m] "pikaman: so you had network time"> Yes
16:47:28 <strcat[m]> rny: ^
16:47:54 <strcat[m]> pikaman: so if you enable network time right now, what happens?
16:51:22 <pikaman[m]> It jumps back to the 1st of January 1970, time becomes 1AM
16:51:23 <pikaman[m]> Plus a few minutes I've been using the phone for
16:51:45 <strcat[m]> yeah so I don't see how the change could cause anything like that
16:51:53 <strcat[m]> you'll need to get `adb logcat` output
16:52:21 <strcat[m]> are you using any kind of strange VPN setup?
16:52:51 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/ac1c20fc1fc1a9c8add9a5be0005c97c83730f89
16:56:32 <strcat[m]> pikaman: it sounds to me like it was never actually working for you and that something is blocking / breaking the connection like TLS interception
16:56:45 <strcat[m]> and what changed is that if it fails a certain way it still tries to set the time based on it
16:56:46 <strcat[m]> which I'll fix
16:56:53 <strcat[m]> but there's something broken about your network
16:58:29 <pikaman[m]> No VPN set-up, pihole on my wifi network though
16:58:43 <pikaman[m]> let me see if I can get that logcat output
16:59:17 <strcat[m]> pikaman: sounds like you're blocking time.grapheneos.org connections
16:59:22 <strcat[m]> or doing TLS interception that breaks it
16:59:53 <strcat[m]> I do think I see an issue but it implies that must be happening for you to hit it
17:00:06 <strcat[m]> it's an issue with the new error handling code rny wrote
17:04:03 <strcat[m]> I'll do a new release but it's quite possible it's not going to resolve your issue
17:04:16 <strcat[m]> and if it does 'resolve' it, you still have the problem that your network is broken
17:04:18 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I have a question about the Graphene screenshot editor.
17:04:18 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Why does it so heavily pixelate the screenshot while editing?  It is almost unusable if I want to highlight text since I can't read anything
17:04:29 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Can I change this behavior?
17:04:33 <strcat[m]> it's the AOSP gallery app
17:04:36 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to use a different editor app
17:05:00 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Huh.  Do you have a recommendation?
17:05:07 <strcat[m]> no, I don't have a recommendation
17:05:15 <strcat[m]> you're free to use the app of your choice, rather than the AOSP gallery app
17:05:42 <Sukuna[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "Huh.  Do you have a recommendati"> Simple Gallery from f-droid ia pretty good.
17:06:08 <Sukuna[m]> * Simple Gallery from f-droid is pretty good.
17:08:04 <strcat[m]> and btw, we really need more people helping with Beta channel testing
17:08:19 <strcat[m]> not many people are using the Beta channel so not many issues are found before stuff is pushed out via Stable
17:09:00 <strcat[m]> I find blatant problems in the internal testing but we rarely get any reports from Beta testers
17:09:06 <strcat[m]> if any at all?
17:09:26 <strcat[m]> it's more work to be using the Beta channel and we could start using Stable directly if it's not adding value
17:09:31 <take_a_deep_brea> @strcat:matrix.org: i am on beta
17:10:13 <take_a_deep_brea> just that my usage is pretty vanilla . if i find something , will report
17:10:48 <strcat[m]> well, working on a new release today for this
17:11:02 <strcat[m]> essentially the issue is that if your network is broken and has never previously gotten network time since boot
17:11:08 <strcat[m]> and it breaks the connection
17:11:21 <strcat[m]> then it's possible it resets the time to Unix epoch
17:11:44 <strcat[m]> due to missing return in code that was added for improved error reporting
17:11:50 <strcat[m]> so, fixing that today
17:12:25 * jonzlo[m] uploaded an image: 3rd place MFs.jpeg (113KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nfyXUUEPcbdaEqiGDKXnysOQ/3rd place MFs.jpeg >

17:29:51 <nux> Anyone else on here use the ProtonMail app and notice that the latest version crashes when attempting to compose an email?
17:31:01 <hobo0000[m]> I am using it but doesnt crash for me
17:32:15 <Adam16628482717> Whats the latest update?
17:32:49 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.02.06.05
17:33:02 <strcat> but there's going to be a new one probably tomorrow with a couple more minor changes anyway
17:33:26 <nux> hobo0000[m]: I'm on version 1.13.25 (latest one in Aurora Store dated 02 February 2021) and when I attempt to compose emails, it crashes. What version are you on?
17:33:35 <Adam16628482717> Nice any security enchamcements
17:34:05 <Adam16628482717> Also, does LTE only mode disable GSM completely
17:34:10 <hobo0000[m]> <nux "hobo0000: I'm on version 1.13.25"> Im on same version
17:34:35 <Adam16628482717> Ive heard LTE has a GSM compatability layer
17:34:39 <strcat> Adam16628482717: it disables all protocols other than LTE
17:34:42 <strcat> no
17:34:43 <strcat> it disables older protocols
17:34:59 <Adam16628482717> Does LTE only mode disable GSM completely
17:35:06 <nux> hobo0000[m]: Have you tried to compose an email with it lately? Me and another user are experiencing the same issue on this latest version.
17:35:08 <strcat> yes, it disables all other protocols
17:35:12 <jalb> Sometimes I think that GOS should record its own video explaining how to install GrapheneOS, somethjing official, no avoid those videos out there. I see that many people are looking for videos instead of text to install it.
17:35:21 <jalb> *to avoid
17:35:42 <strcat[m]> jalb: don't need it, there's https://grapheneos.org/install/web
17:35:55 <strcat[m]> people probably shouldn't be using the CLI install guide if they aren't familiar with the CLI
17:36:16 <jalb> strcat[m], yes but people first look for a video and then...
17:36:23 <hobo0000[m]> <nux "hobo0000: Have you tried to comp"> Yeah but it works..
17:36:40 <jalb> they only find those videos
17:37:01 <strcat[m]> so we can do something to make it so you can't even start following them, like moving things around
17:37:06 <strcat[m]> don't really feel like it
17:37:07 <jalb> For those people it could be good, to be an official video, and you can change it or delete it when you wnat
17:37:11 <jalb> *want
17:37:13 <strcat[m]> there's https://grapheneos.org/install/web
17:37:20 <strcat[m]> if people choose to follow an inaccurate video, it's their fault
17:37:28 <nux> hobo0000[m]: Receiving/reading works fine. It's just composing crashes for us. We're on the latest GrapheneOS on Pixel 4a devices. What hardware are you on?
17:37:30 <strcat[m]> we say not to use them on our site
17:37:37 <jalb> ok
17:38:35 <strcat[m]> jalb: contact the people who posted the inaccurate videos
17:38:37 <strcat[m]> ask them to take it down
17:38:51 <strcat[m]> report it as harmful / misleading content
17:39:01 <jalb> I know but they won't do it and I read a lot about it here, those problems, it was only to avoid it
17:39:07 <strcat[m]> if the video is accurate and follows our guide properly then it doesn't matter
17:39:09 <jalb> But I will
17:39:26 <jalb> I will tell them
17:39:44 <hobo0000[m]> <nux "hobo0000: Receiving/reading work"> Im on pixel4a too but it works fine.. Weird
17:40:32 <jalb> Updating... I'll let you know if it happens to me what it's told about time
17:40:39 <jalb> pixel 3a
17:40:50 <jalb> Thanks for the update!
17:42:44 <strcat[m]> currently starting a new release fixing the new error reporting code for time updates
17:42:58 <strcat[m]> so no need to discuss that more, will be addressed in the next release
17:43:17 <nux> hobo0000[m]: We've uninstalled/reinstalled the ProtonMail app and we both get the same result when attempting to compose emails. The compose screen shows for a fraction of a second and then crashes. Most of the time the app recovers to the initial list of received emails page but sometimes it exits entirely. I can't believe nobody else is having the same issue! Thanks anyway though...
17:43:24 <jalb> ok
17:44:18 <hobo0000[m]> <nux "hobo0000: We've uninstalled/rein"> Thats weird..🤔🤔🤔
17:45:44 <strcat[m]> nux: check `adb logcat` for error output
17:48:59 <nux> strcat[m]: Checking now...
17:53:04 <jalb> All ok here after the update in my Pixel 3a
17:53:12 <jalb> Date is ok
17:55:18 <nux> strcat[m]: Nothing jumps out at me in the logs except for google services missing, which makes sense and has never caused the app to crash before...
17:57:12 <nux> strcat[m]: Found this --> EventSequenceValidator: Transition from INTENT_STARTED to INTENT_FAILED
17:58:22 <strcat[m]> nux: do you see anything else
17:58:28 <strcat[m]> that looks like the result of handling the error
17:58:36 <strcat[m]> rather than the error itself
17:58:38 <strcat[m]> the error itself would be earlier
18:02:41 <nux> strcat[m]: It's hard to correlate logcat output for the specific action due to so much unrelated output. Immediately before the transition to INTENT_FAILED there are a bunch of audio ralated entries. Probably unrelated though...
18:03:35 <strcat[m]> nux: it's tagged with what produced the output
18:03:37 <nux> strcat[m]: I think I can filter them on process ID. Hold on...
18:03:56 <nux> strcat[m]: Yeah, just realized that. Checking again...
18:14:27 <m2tu[m]> Does anyone know why when i  dissable some lines on Androidmanifest.xml of SystemUI ... when i build and flash the whole phone become changed and not funcionally?
18:14:47 <m2tu[m]> no status bar and power button not work to lock phone
18:17:52 <nux> strcat[m]: The two numeric fields after the date are what? I'd like to use one or both to filter the output to relevant output from the ProtonMail processes. I filtered on the first field but it seems I might be losing some relevant data.
18:19:50 <strcat[m]> nux: pid and tid
18:20:25 <nux> strcat[m]: process ID and what is tid?
18:20:33 <strcat[m]> if it actually crashes (like a segmentation fault, not an uncaught Java exception) then the traceback comes from another process
18:20:39 <strcat[m]> nux:  thread id
18:20:44 <strcat[m]> just ignore tid
18:20:51 <nux> strcat[m]: ok
18:21:02 <strcat[m]> the main thread in a process has pid == tid
18:21:11 <strcat[m]> secondary threads have the same pid but their own unique tid
18:21:30 <nux> strcat[m]: I didn't see any segmentation faults.
18:21:45 <strcat[m]> filtering by pid is probably enough
18:25:10 <nux> strcat[m]: Yeah, I now have a more concise output, that is filtered on PID, in a text file and I'm going through it now.
18:25:13 <m2tu[m]> Can i prevent bluetooth from setting on my editing SystemUI manifest file ?
18:28:04 <strcat[m]> m2tu: don't understand the question
18:28:13 <strcat[m]> can you clarify what you're trying to do?
18:29:33 <snooopy> Uh, it seems that this bug fixed itself in one of the past stable releases? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/24
18:30:09 <m2tu[m]> Im trying to edit AndroidManifest.xml of SystemUI app in build maps...  What i try to do is to block bluetooth

18:33:38 <m2tu[m]> or is it wrong app to work on
18:34:06 <zelzek[m]> hi, i'm new to the matrix instance, but not exactly new to graphene.  i was wondering if i could ask some advice on my use-case and respective applications.
18:35:49 <strcat[m]> zelzek:  ues
18:36:00 <strcat[m]> zelzek: if it's specifically about GrapheneOS this is a good channel for it
18:36:18 <strcat[m]> zelzek: if it's more general then #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org is better
18:36:24 <strcat[m]> you could ask relevant stuff here and other stuff there
18:36:30 <strcat[m]> not that important
18:36:48 <zelzek[m]> Thanks.
18:37:00 <zelzek[m]> ill ask here but if you feel it's off topic, please ask me to move.
18:39:03 <zelzek[m]> i have a pixel 4 with graphene and love it.  I work in the computer security area of research and use XMPP/Signal/Note taking/Matrix/Music/Tor/VPN (For my private mesh) daily.  My employer requires a phone number on file and likes to text/call me so I'm not sure how to handle that as a.) I don't use baseband and if i did it would be for data only. b.) I'm not sure what voip clients are availble on android/graphene.  My
18:39:03 <zelzek[m]> ask is what's a solid xmpp/matrix client and also any client that can handle Voip/Sip via Voip.ms or something else that can receive text messages for my employer.
18:40:14 <zelzek[m]> I have been looking at conversations and blabber for xmpp, i occasionally use fediverse services but having a pleroma/mastodon client is not necessary, but the main gotcha is keeping in touch with employer without having to give out a baseband e164 number
18:40:51 <wrt[m]> <zelzek[m] "i have a pixel 4 with graphene a"> beeperhq.com looks like it could
18:42:20 <zelzek[m]> <wrt[m] "beeperhq.com looks like it could"> this looks interesting, i appreciate the suggestion.

18:46:23 <gusr1727[m]> * Got it. As a temporary workaround, the date and clock can be set manually
18:46:28 <strcat[m]> gusr1727: the issue is there's something odd about your network and it's breaking time updates at least some of the time
18:46:35 <strcat[m]> and there's an issue we had to fix with how it handles errors
18:46:43 <strcat[m]> it's fixed now, being made into a new release
18:48:45 <gusr1727[m]> strcat Thanks! Sorry for the duplicates, still trying to get used to element on mobile
18:48:55 <zelzek[m]> i think all of the bridges in that repo can cover my bases especially when my phone is off and i just want to work on my laptop.
18:49:29 <zelzek[m]> for matrix is element the default client on android?  I have my own home instance for myself and friends/colleagues and never tried a mobile client before.
18:49:56 <zelzek[m]> also if there's a place i can send donations to daniel and team that'd be good.  graphene really gave me back some control of my mobile usage.
18:50:24 <nux> strcat[m]: It looks like ProtonMail compose intent requests network services and during that process, something goes wrong (ConnectivityService NetworkRequestInfo binderDied) and it goes downhill from there, eventually force killing the compose activity and recovering to main. This level of debug is beyond my capabilities at this point.
18:51:08 <nux> strcat[m]: My guess is some sort of network permission issue.
18:51:12 <zelzek[m]> as for mail, i'm not worried about that.  i only check my mail when needed and i built my own bridge from my mail server to signal for now.  but can likely be integrated into matrix.
18:51:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy zelzek[m], there is a donation address (several of them) for Bitcoin, Monero, Github sponsorship, or if all else fails, Pay Pal at https://grapheneos.org/donate ! On behalf of the project, any donations you can send are going to really help and really be appreciated!
18:52:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat you here?
18:52:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> So a user reported network activity on an app that was not granted the network permission ever
18:52:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> I told them to come here but they haven't
18:52:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> What would you tell them?
18:52:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's some random app they claim to have gotten off fdroid

19:01:08 <strcat> I really don't know what you're talking about
19:01:19 <strcat> I don't know what you're trying to do or why you think this is the way to do it
19:01:27 <m2tu[m]> when i changed it , the whole phone become unstable
19:01:52 <strcat> you do not need to build the OS to disable Bluetooth / USB debugging and if you want to prevent people from using it on a phone that you own
19:01:56 <strcat> use a device manager

19:20:38 <userman23[m]> I am not sure if this is a GrapheneOS issue, or an app issue.  But I am not getting any audio notifications from my Signal app when I get a new message... I checked my settings, and notifications are on.
19:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you strcat[m]
19:21:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Yes thank you for all this hard work strcat and everyone else
19:22:24 <strcat[m]> it will take longer than usual for this release to become available, just announcing it early to minimize more reports of the time sync error handling issue
19:22:30 <strcat[m]> hopefully the fix works well
19:22:40 <m2tu[m]> Is there a way to remove ScreenRecorder?
19:22:59 <strcat[m]> you can remove apps that are included by removing them from PRODUCT_PACKAGES
19:23:11 <alex-resist> strcat I'm gonna dedicate one Pixel 3a for testing beta releases, at least for a while
19:23:12 <TheJollyRoger> userman23[m]: Hang on a second and let me test audio alerts from Signal.
19:23:23 <TheJollyRoger> alex-resist: Beautiful!
19:23:27 <userman23[m]> thank you
19:23:33 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: the issue with the previous one is we wanted to get that Vanadium update out
19:23:36 <strcat[m]> so tested it for 1 day
19:23:40 <strcat[m]> didn't have any issue reports
19:24:00 <strcat[m]> if we only have 300 people using beta and only 50 of them are going to promptly report issues (if at all), we aren't getting much coverage from it
19:24:01 <m2tu[m]> ok thanks ;:)
19:24:20 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: a common thing is we release something in beta, wait 2-3 days
19:24:34 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: release via stable, then, within an hour, get 10 people reporting some minor issue
19:24:41 <m2tu[m]> i managed to remove face camera and left back only.... begin to love programming :))))
19:24:48 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so, clearly, we need more beta testing
19:25:53 <alex-resist> I always thought you had dozens of beta testers, but apparently that is not the case
19:25:56 <TheJollyRoger> userman23[m]: Text and calls produce audio notifications with both default and tuned settings. Custom notifications (Contact-specific alerts) are also working as expected as well.
19:26:41 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we have more than dozens
19:26:51 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: but if an issue impacts 1/300 people
19:26:53 <userman23[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you for checking.  Any ideas where to go from here?  My phone is up to date, a restart has already been done... not really sure what else to try... a re-install of the app?
19:26:58 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: and only 20% of the beta testers actually report issues they hit
19:27:06 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I think a lot of people use beta just to get it sooner
19:27:13 <strcat[m]>  * alex-resist: and if only 20% of the beta testers actually report issues they hit
19:27:25 <alex-resist> I think that is true
19:27:30 <strcat[m]>  * alex-resist: and if only 20% of the beta testers actually report issues they hit, low chance of having it reported
19:27:35 <alex-resist> People are on beta to be edgy but don't report issues
19:27:41 <strcat[m]> yeah so maybe people did hit the issue in beta
19:27:45 <strcat[m]> but we didn't hear about it
19:27:49 <alex-resist> Or they didn't care
19:28:06 <strcat[m]> well, same thing, not reported, so no reason for us to cancel releasing via stable
19:28:08 <strcat[m]> that's how it works
19:28:20 <strcat[m]> it's worked fine on all my devices
19:28:25 <strcat[m]> it's an issue with the error handling for time updates
19:28:35 <strcat[m]> if there is no error, it works fine, and we did test error handling
19:28:43 <strcat[m]> it requires the first time sync to fail, I think
19:28:47 <strcat[m]> to hit the issue
19:29:08 <strcat[m]> it's possible there's some other issue but pretty sure I fixed it properly
19:29:10 <TheJollyRoger> userman23[m]: I also have signal set for "Not optimized" so it can run in the background, if that makes any difference?
19:32:22 <alex-resist> strcat I probably wouldn't have noticed an issue with the last release because beta deployment probably was super fast. I'm on a 100 Mbit connection so I probably wouldn't have noticed the size of the update
19:32:47 <alex-resist> But I will keep one device on beta for a while and try to help whenever I can
19:32:58 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I'm talking about the time sync thing
19:33:12 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it's an edge case that's only going to happen to people with broken networks
19:33:24 <alex-resist> Ok I see
19:33:27 <strcat[m]> so we needed to have someone with that problem using the beta and actually reporting an issue when they found it
19:33:29 <strcat[m]> and we didn'tr
19:33:32 <strcat[m]>  * and we didn't
19:33:38 <alex-resist> I was talking about the update size issue, I wouldn't have noticed it even in beta
19:33:50 <alex-resist> strcat I see, there is almost no one left
19:34:22 <strcat[m]> basically if your first time sync since boot to time.grapheneos.org fails
19:34:26 <strcat[m]> it screws up the time, I think
19:34:45 <strcat[m]> because the error reporting code that was added makes it return success instead of failure
19:35:07 <strcat[m]> but then it'll fix it next time
19:35:16 <strcat[m]> so, unless your network is broken
19:35:18 <strcat[m]> it's temporary
19:39:08 <MottelMottel> Hello!
19:39:09 <MottelMottel> Many weeks ago I installed GrapheneOS on my unlocked Pixel3a.
19:39:09 <MottelMottel> I followed all instructions on their site.
19:39:10 <MottelMottel> Now I found all these Android things on my data-usage...
19:39:10 <MottelMottel> Seamless Update Client
19:39:11 <MottelMottel> Android OS

19:39:17 <MottelMottel> Android OS>com.qualcomm.qti.telephoneservice
19:39:46 <strcat> MottelMottel: those are standard OS components, mostly tied to implementing mobile data / services
19:40:18 <strcat> nothing to be concerned about there
19:41:36 <strcat> and that's just a list of stuff that's considered an OS component
19:41:58 <skrillz[m]> Firefox or chrome?
19:41:58 <skrillz[m]> Tor or VPN?
19:42:28 <strcat> skrillz[m]: it's not really on-topic for this channel unless it's specifically about GrapheneOS
19:42:34 <wrt[m]> ff and tor
19:42:51 <strcat> you can't give someone advice like that without having an understanding of their use case
19:42:59 <strcat> this is not the place to blindly promote software you like
19:43:35 <m2tu[m]> MottelMottel: You can try to remove them if u dont use them from adb
19:43:44 <strcat> m2tu[m]: no
19:44:10 <strcat> please don't advise that someone disables OS components
19:44:15 <strcat> when they don't have an understanding of it
19:44:15 <m2tu[m]> if he don't use siimcard
19:44:19 <strcat> they should not be using adb
19:44:20 <strcat> no
19:44:32 <m2tu[m]> you right :)
19:44:40 <strcat> they shouldn't have developer options enabled, it's not a good idea
19:44:49 <strcat> messing around with adb disabling stuff without knowing what it is
19:44:50 <TheJollyRoger> wrt[m]: skrillz[m] with respect to the use case of GrapheneOS, is to just use Vanadium, and to avoid Gecko-based browsers as they are not internally sandboxed. The usage guide is here: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
19:44:51 <strcat> not a good plan
19:44:54 <skrillz[m]> For data use on graphene; vanadium is a given for chrome
19:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> *the use case of GrapheneOS, the project's stance is to just use Vanadium
19:45:33 <strcat> chrome isn't the same thing as chromium
19:45:34 <TheJollyRoger> as for other use cases, productive discussion about other platforms is welcomed in #grapheneos-offtopic.
19:45:36 <strcat> vanadium isn't chrome
19:46:22 <skrillz[m]> How about for data? I found a pass through firewall with blacklists that doesn't touch dns, I can stack with a VPN or tor
19:48:41 <strcat[m]> skrillz: not clear what you mean, and you're unlikely to be getting the value you expect from an additional firewall
19:48:50 <strcat[m]> fine-grained firewall filtering isn't really something that works properly
19:49:10 <strcat[m]> if an app can make DNS queries it can exfiltrate data to anywhere
19:49:36 <TheJollyRoger> I always encourage homebrewing for the purposes of experimentation and testing. I don't however, encourage expecting privacy from something that is experimental and likely to break in strange ways. Schneier's axiom (put mildly) of "it's easy to not see the flaws in your own design" comes into play.
19:49:48 <MottelMottel> and the google logo at the beginning, no concern either?
19:50:01 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: no concern either. It just lets you know who made the handset.
19:50:01 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: it's the brand of the phone, shown at boot
19:50:14 <skrillz[m]> Just trying to block trackers on some apps. Otherwise I was thinking of a separate device for luckypatcher to remove trackers and then install the apk on graphene ; I can block at domain level dns
19:50:19 <MottelMottel> TYVM!!!
19:50:37 <strcat[m]> skrillz: not clear what you mean by 'tracker', apps are sandboxed, they have the data and access you trust them to have
19:50:49 <strcat[m]> skrillz: if you don't trust an app with data, don't give it to them
19:51:00 <strcat[m]> skrillz: filtering some of their requests is not going to stop them giving it to third parties in any way
19:51:17 <strcat[m]> skrillz: https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356400290640125952 and about trying to do fine-grained filtering
19:51:36 <strcat[m]> skrillz: and recommend reading the documentation on our site too which covers these things
19:52:12 <skrillz[m]> pDns +Ovpn and Netguard+Orbot DNS blocking without rerouting DNS
19:52:41 <MottelMottel> Can you please recommed, secured/private calendar (for reminders and todos etc.) that work well in GrapheneOS? The calendar that comes with it, it only shows the dates, no option to add anything in it. TY!!
19:53:00 <skrillz[m]> It can't perform the DNS queries if its blocked this way
19:53:44 <skrillz[m]> And its masked in the vpn,/tor BC it uses their DNS and doesn't have webrtc leaks
19:53:58 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: Etar is decent
19:54:16 <strcat[m]> skrillz: it can perform DNS queries, that's how the app works
19:54:28 <strcat[m]> skrillz: I think you're misunderstanding how DNS works and what that post says
19:54:39 <strcat[m]> skrillz: it's not talking about DNS leaks for a VPN
19:54:58 <strcat[m]> skrillz: it's talking about apps being able to send data to any party they want via DNS queries, through the OS configured DNS server
19:55:00 <MottelMottel> Thank you! is nextcloud recommended to use with GrapheneOS for a beginner?
19:55:11 <strcat[m]> they do not have to make any direct connection to the servers they're exfiltrating the data to
19:55:35 <skrillz[m]> Yes and I'm saying it can be blocked I can block requests to grapheme os on the backend
19:55:41 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: you can use it if you want, don't think there's any advice that can be given on that
19:56:00 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: It depends. Nextcloud quality of service, features, availability, and privacy varies by who's hosting it.
19:56:21 <mynacol[m]> skrillz: You know Graphene has an integrated firewall more powerful than any app solution?
19:56:23 <strcat[m]> skrillz: I think you're misunderstanding the point being made
19:56:46 <MottelMottel> TheJollyRoger do you mean the server provider?
19:56:56 <strcat[m]> the app asks the OS to resolve <data>.domain.tld
19:57:07 <strcat[m]> it sends a DNS query to your configured DNS server for that
19:57:26 <strcat[m]> which chains along to whatever DNS server is actually resolving the requests rather than forwarding
19:57:32 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: yes, the person (or group) that's providing your Nextcloud service.
19:57:43 <strcat[m]> and then that contacts the authoritative DNS server chosen by domain.tld
19:57:50 <strcat[m]> and queries <data>.domain.tld
19:58:05 <strcat[m]> which means it can send and receive (via the response) arbitrary data from any party
19:58:18 <strcat[m]> through normal DNS queries made via the normal DNS server for the network
19:58:22 <strcat[m]> or that you've chosen to override it with
19:58:40 <strcat[m]> and this applies to other things, not just DNS, but DNS is there for basic network functionality to work
19:58:44 <strcat[m]> so it's a nice example
19:59:01 <strcat[m]> skrillz: the app never connects to that server, your configured DNS server does
19:59:07 <mynacol[m]> skrillz: From the Graphene website: Network permission toggle disallowing both direct and indirect network access, superior to a purely firewall-based implementation only disallowing direct access to the network without covering inter-process communication (enabled by default for compatibility)
19:59:45 <strcat[m]> DNS allows sending / receiving data to arbitrary parties with no direct connections to them simply by querying records for their domains
19:59:57 <strcat[m]> via your usual DNS server
19:59:59 <mynacol[m]> And yes you can still use VPN/Tor/whatever if you want to
19:59:59 <strcat[m]> that's how DNS works
20:00:21 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. DNS Sidechannel.
20:00:36 <strcat[m]> not really a side channel
20:00:42 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
20:00:54 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356400290640125952
20:00:58 * skrillz[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210207-150032.png (131KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nyfabzQZDTJOAFWLcaTVcfbe/Screenshot_20210207-150032.png >
20:01:53 <skrillz[m]> DNS filter w native graphene passthrough
20:02:08 <TheJollyRoger> skrillz[m]: I don't think you're listening.
20:02:28 <skrillz[m]> Am I wrong then ? I can block the queries
20:02:36 <mynacol[m]> skrillz What is your goal? Filtering DNS requests but why? Being "anonymous"?
20:02:52 <strcat[m]> skrillz: please read that thread and the documentation on the site
20:02:57 <MottelMottel> TheJollyRoger TYVM!
20:03:36 <strcat[m]> we have official advice on this stuff
20:03:37 <skrillz[m]> It doesn't leave the device and I'm trying to block ads and tracker connections within apps . bromite has adblocking built in so that's fine but other apps dont
20:03:38 <strcat[m]> skrillz: you're using a VPN + custom DNS filtering
20:04:15 <skrillz[m]> Yes
20:04:15 <strcat[m]> skrillz: that means you do not have anonymity with the VPN, but rather, you stand out from all other users of the VPN
20:04:16 <strcat[m]> so you can be detected by every site, etc.
20:04:16 <strcat[m]> as a unique person
20:04:16 <strcat[m]> based on your unique setup
20:04:17 <strcat[m]> skrillz: we cover this on our site
20:04:43 <strcat[m]> we could more strongly recommend using the VPN provided DNS if it's not clear what the consequences are from not doing that
20:04:56 <strcat[m]> but I think we explain it pretty well
20:05:07 <skrillz[m]> Oh because I'm the only VPN user that's blocking ads I thought I'd only stand out if I used a different DNS than the vpn
20:05:14 <strcat[m]> there's official advice on this so if you want advice there's good advice on the site and that twitter thread is relevant too
20:05:36 <skrillz[m]> The DNS filter doesn't change the DNS servers though
20:05:48 <strcat[m]> skrillz: because sites can enumerate your blocking rules, they can list 20 domains chosen to detect different filters / differentiate them and connect to those (or more)
20:05:59 <mynacol[m]> skrillz: BTW your modus operandi is based on blocklists and "default allow". This is prone to failure. The following article explains this http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/
20:06:02 <strcat[m]> skrillz:  sure but they can see what you block and don't block, and that's part of your fingerprint
20:06:14 <skrillz[m]> Yeah gotcha
20:06:42 <strcat[m]> if you want to blend in with other VPN users you should use their DNS servers and don't do additional filtering, etc. beyond what they offer
20:06:49 <strcat[m]> there's a reason the Tor Browser has none of that
20:07:03 <strcat[m]> although it does nothing to stop you screwing it up
20:07:16 <strcat[m]> and they have a lot of foot guns that are present
20:07:20 <strcat[m]> easy ways to screw it up
20:08:06 <mynacol[m]> skril Youlz  You are better off using services and apps that meet your privacy needs.
20:12:48 <MottelMottel> One last question from this beginner in Privacy/GrapheneOS: Any way to protect my privacy from mobile service providers without using internet based apps such as "Signal"? Avoiding servers and internet? —using actual SMS and calls (i tried "Silence" for SMS,  but it didn't  work on the  recipients side (non-GrapheneOS)) TY!
20:13:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> mynacol: interesting article btw
20:13:59 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: don't use carrier-based calls and texts
20:14:10 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: the carriers have access to the metadata and data
20:14:22 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: not just your carrier, other carriers, other parties
20:14:30 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: You'll need to establish a clear threat model first.
20:14:51 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: not clear what you mean by 'avoiding servers and internet'
20:15:17 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: SMS and calls are implemented via servers, and on a modern connection, they are implemented via normal IP connections over data (cellular or even Wi-Fi if supported)
20:15:34 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: if you want to avoid servers and the Internet, you can turn on Airplane Mode and switch WiFi off... but this doesn't leave you with much you can do with your device.
20:15:51 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: modern implementation (LTE) of carrier-based texts and calls is over data using a variant of SIP
20:16:03 <MottelMottel> strcat[m] are you saying, only when I actually make a call and use SMS, or just by having their service activated on my grapeheneOS device even when not texting not calling?
20:16:03 <strcat[m]> either way, legacy or modern, it uses their servers
20:16:36 <strcat[m]> I'm saying that in no way do you avoid using servers / internet access by only using carrier-based calls / texts
20:17:01 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you're trying to accomplish but what you're saying is concerning
20:17:08 <strcat[m]> avoid carrier-based calls and texts
20:17:27 <skrillz[m]> Is sip over carrier data better?
20:17:28 <strcat[m]> use Signal as an easy to use baseline where's it's very easy to convince others to adopt it
20:17:39 <strcat[m]> skrillz: better than what?
20:17:44 <strcat[m]> skrillz: not clear what you're asking
20:17:54 <strcat[m]> skrillz: SIP is how SMS and calls are implemented in LTE
20:18:00 <MottelMottel> TheJollyRoger I thought even on ariplane mode they can collect data, no? Won't the decive load data to them right after going back from Airplaine mode? and arent's mics still pottentially collecting and analyzing and comparing noise enviroment to dtermine locations, etc.?
20:18:18 <strcat[m]> skrillz: the carriers have access to the data and metadata, it uses their servers, and the servers of other carriers, it's a federated network of carriers
20:18:52 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: that doesn't make sense - you're not reasoning about it in a logical way
20:19:15 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: you're talking about it as if the device is deeply compromised but yet you're also not treating it that way
20:19:48 <MottelMottel> strcat[m] i have no problem using signal, but i find many of my contacts are still using whatssapp and not Signal, so no way to send secured messages when the 2 parties do not share same app?
20:19:52 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: if you have airplane mode enabled, the cellular radio transmit/receive is disabled, you aren't connected to a mobile network
20:19:54 <skrillz[m]> Sorry I meant VoIP
20:20:16 <strcat[m]> skrillz: VOIP is how carrier-based calls work for LTE and above
20:20:43 <strcat[m]> skrillz: Voice over IP is not really a very specific thing
20:20:45 <strcat[m]> and as I said
20:20:51 <strcat[m]> carrier-based calls are not private
20:20:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: wifi calling too then?
20:21:11 <strcat[m]> what about it?
20:21:16 <strcat[m]> I think I've been really clear
20:21:57 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: if you want to communicate with them securely, get them to install Signal
20:22:10 <strcat[m]> if they won't install Signal they must not want to talk to you very much, because that's a low bar
20:22:13 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: that's correct. Your contacts must be on Signal, in order for you to use Signal with them.
20:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> Signal and WhatsApp do not interoperate.
20:22:34 <MottelMottel> are carriers collecting data (like location) even when not making calls or sending sms?
20:22:52 <strcat[m]> if you have cellular enabled, yeah
20:23:12 <strcat[m]> you're actively connected to their network
20:23:16 <strcat[m]> it knows where you are
20:23:22 <strcat[m]> and presumably you're using data
20:23:23 <TheJollyRoger> There is a legitimate need for that: they need to know which towers to transmit and recieve from.
20:24:16 <MottelMottel> so unless i use wifi, if I need internet, I must let them collect my data, correct? Or am I missing somthing?
20:24:27 <pikaman[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/releases#"> Thanks for the hard work, appreciated :)
20:24:32 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: I mean the Wi-Fi network / ISP is going to collect data too
20:24:43 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: but Wi-Fi can be used anonymously on our supported devices
20:24:51 <strcat[m]> if you AVOID doing things that uniquely identify you to networks
20:25:07 <strcat[m]> which probably means using a common VPN
20:25:11 <MottelMottel> right, but what about if i am using Orbot?
20:25:34 <MottelMottel> in VPN mode and bridges, and i enable VPN on GrapheneOS
20:25:58 <strcat[m]> considered a VPN for this context
20:25:59 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: you'll still need to adhere to basic principles of opsec even if you use the tools.
20:26:21 <strcat[m]> MottelMottel: you just have to reason about things in a logical way
20:26:27 <strcat[m]> decide what you want and think it through
20:26:54 <strcat[m]> lots of information available on our site and the Twitter accounts of the project

20:27:28 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage
20:27:40 <strcat[m]> lots of information beyond those pages too
20:27:59 <MottelMottel> got it, befire I leave you alone with my beginner questions, for today, would you recmmend sources of info for a beginner, so i can make more educated inquieres in the future? material made for beginners with no previous technical knowdlge? just a fan of technologie and new-fan of privacy
20:28:12 <MottelMottel> great thank you! those good for beginners?
20:28:23 <strcat[m]> a lot of it is
20:28:39 <MottelMottel> thank you so much, SUPER appreciated!
20:28:42 <TheJollyRoger> MottelMottel: a good place to follow is https://twitter.com/DanielMicay
20:29:30 <MottelMottel> I stoped using Twitter :/  ... but if you guys using it and Micay is in there I imagine theres a secured/private way to use it?
20:30:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> secured/private, not really
20:30:46 <strcat[m]> it's public
20:30:54 <strcat[m]> don't use twitter DMs to have private conversations on it
20:30:54 <hypokeimenon[m]> but, you can use nitter
20:30:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> https://github.com/zedeus/nitter
20:30:58 <strcat[m]> use it as a public forum
20:31:04 <strcat[m]> don't see the issue with that
20:31:58 <strcat[m]> my usage of twitter isn't meant to be private: I publish stuff through it
20:32:02 <strcat[m]> tweets, likes, etc. are published
20:32:28 <strcat[m]> I don't treat DMs as private, just a way to get other people not to jump in
20:32:53 <strcat[m]> assume they'll be leaked and will be public
20:34:22 <strcat[m]> all this stuff is getting too off-topic
20:34:34 <MottelMottel> so just having it installed, isnt that an issue? dont these apps, track and collect data by just being installed on your device? or that's incorrect (so sorry for my level of ignorance)
20:34:43 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed
20:34:47 <strcat[m]> you choose what data / access to give them
20:35:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> which apps?
20:35:08 <strcat[m]> so, of course, an app knows what data you enter into it and how you use it
20:35:31 <MottelMottel> okay strcat[m] my appologies, will leave now :)  - will do my education on provacy
20:35:35 <strcat[m]> and no one suggested using their app anyway
20:35:36 <MottelMottel> much appreciated!
20:35:39 <strcat[m]> there is mobile.twitter.com
20:35:53 <strcat[m]> don't use an app when the website is good enough - or in this case, a lot less bad
20:36:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> MottelMottel: I think the main point here is about practicing good digital hygiene and OPSEC. If you're using an application you don't want to, projects like Graphene OS give you tools to isolate it from stuff that matters more to you
20:36:09 <MottelMottel> got it! thank you SO much!
20:36:29 <skrillz[m]> Would downloading something like Snapchat or Facebook be safe in a work profile app like island ?
20:36:36 <strcat[m]> definitely don't use twitter to have private conversations
20:36:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> Assume anything you post or do on the platform will be mined, leaked or abused at some point for agendas outside of your control, and exercise due caution
20:36:46 <strcat[m]> assume they'll leak all your DMs
20:36:52 <strcat[m]> or that their employees will spy on them
20:36:57 <skrillz[m]> And would it be able to see other apps or data in the island ?
20:37:06 <MottelMottel> but for example, instagram, if one needs it for work, that only works as an app, any way around that?
20:37:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "don't use an app when the websit"> yep, this ^
20:38:00 <strcat[m]> just bear in mind that any site or app you use knows exactly what data you enter into it, how you use it (what you view, etc.)
20:38:07 * skrillz[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210207-153736.png (74KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MfoBBQYLeNRrtfMdQRpFlGMT/Screenshot_20210207-153736.png >
20:38:15 <strcat[m]> and they don't need any third party access from the client side to send that to every third party they want
20:38:39 <hypokeimenon[m]> <MottelMottel "but for example, instagram, if o"> what data do you not want to be associated with your general/personal life while you use it?
20:38:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> start from there, and then you can figure out ways to compartmentalise
20:39:03 <strcat[m]> you can also put it in a user profile
20:39:09 <strcat[m]> if it demands access to say, contacts, to work
20:39:16 <strcat[m]> put it in a user profile without any contacts
20:39:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> MottelMottel: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:39:37 <strcat[m]> if it doesn't force you to grant it access to stuff then just don't give it access
20:39:43 <strcat[m]> if it does, use a user profile
20:40:08 <MottelMottel> THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!
20:40:16 <strcat[m]> don't give an app data or access to stuff you don't want it to have
20:40:19 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, shipmate.
20:40:26 <strcat[m]> and it forces that, put it in a user profile where you're fine with giving it that access
20:40:26 <Undispelled[m]> <skrillz[m] "And would it be able to see othe"> As far as I'm aware, work profiles are limited to exist as two separate "islands". You can choose to install an app in one profile and it will only have access to data in that island
20:40:38 <strcat[m]> if it demands access to photos, put it in a user profile without any of your photos, etc.
20:40:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: pm btw it's kinda urgent
20:41:23 <Undispelled[m]> skrillz so if I install Facebook and Snapchat in the island, its like having a separate phone with those two apps, so yes, they can see each other
20:42:01 <strcat[m]> we recommend user profiles
20:42:07 <strcat[m]> which are controlled by the user, not a third party app\
20:42:11 <strcat[m]>  * which are controlled by the user, not a third party app
20:42:15 <strcat[m]> and each has their own encryption key
20:42:35 <strcat[m]> work profiles are designed for remote management of a profile via a device manager, the device manager owns it, not you
20:42:46 <strcat[m]> and you can only have 1 per user profile
20:43:11 <strcat[m]> we aren't in control of what a device manager chooses to do with a work profile
20:43:17 <strcat[m]> it could make it so that it's not properly isolated
20:43:57 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m], sometime would you like me to start a proposal or open an issue for exposing more of the profile functionality to the user, and integrating it into the settings? I typed something up like that but sort of left it and set it aside.
20:44:38 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: we did it in the past but like many things lack of help maintaining it means it goes away
20:44:41 <strcat[m]> we need a LOT more help with development
20:45:19 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Aye, captain.
20:45:32 <TheJollyRoger> I will sit on it for now!
20:46:04 <giffgaff[m]> When I type a website address into the search bar on Tor and press enter. The search begins with insecure connection

21:06:02 <giffgaff[m]> I'm running Grapheme OS. The time and date on my device changed and I was unable  connect to the internet a few hours ago
21:07:19 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: it's a known issue, a new release has been announced resolving it
21:07:29 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: you can manually fix the time for now
21:08:34 <strcat[m]> having the wrong time will break HTTPS, etc. due to certificate expiry so that's expected
21:08:35 <strcat[m]> set the correct time and it'll work fine
21:09:13 <strcat[m]> the issue wasn't detected in internal or Beta testing because it only impacts people with a broken network
21:09:14 <strcat[m]> has been fixed, new release will be available soon
21:09:15 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.02.07.17
21:10:25 <strcat[m]> we need more Beta testers to help find and report issues like this so that the Beta channel serves the intended purpose of catching these issues before they make it to Stable
21:10:37 <strcat[m]> using the Beta channel does no good if you don't report issues though
21:10:58 <giffgaff[m]> I'm using a stable channel
21:14:05 <strcat[m]> I'm explaining it for other people

21:38:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I already replied to them in detail
21:38:55 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's unhelpful to repeat it
21:38:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry a little tired
21:39:00 <strcat[m]> they need to read my response
21:39:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: okay, don't try to provide help in the channel right now then, focus on the work you're doing
21:39:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> giffgaff I understand the inconvenience it has caused you. Please wait for the release
21:39:23 <strcat[m]> you're trying to do too many things at once
21:39:26 <giffgaff[m]> Why did you remove all my photo uploads?
21:39:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can get the release faster if you wish to by opening the updater app and checking for updates
21:39:47 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I already gave a reply, it's not helpful
21:40:33 <giffgaff[m]> Calm down I was only asking the  question
21:40:46 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: did you read my response?
21:41:00 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Imagine being a web server and seeing a TLS certificate from 1970 👀
21:41:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> giffgaff: you uploaded too many photos and you need to understand that might be annoying to the other people here. Please don't take that as something else.
21:41:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your issue has been resolved and we are rolling out a fix rn
21:41:05 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: you need to set the date manually for now, then you'll get an update with a fix for the issue and you can set it to automatic again
21:41:08 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: that's not the issue
21:41:49 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: you posted several pages of screenshots after I'd given you a full explanation above, and you're asking about it as if I didn't reply
21:41:58 <strcat[m]> so I removed it because we don't need 3 pages of screenshots about it
21:42:06 <strcat[m]> the issue is known, you got an explanation
21:42:27 <giffgaff[m]> I seen your reply. I was only asking what happened with the update
21:42:30 <ted_lavender[m]> My location I am pretty much limited to T-Mobile or Verizon, can anyone reccomend one over the other?
21:42:36 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: I explained that

21:46:55 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: set the date/time correctly by hand for now
21:47:12 <strcat[m]> the new release which has been announced has a fix for the error handling issue
21:47:32 <giffgaff[m]> Its all good at my end. I done I reset and disabled the seamless client update
21:47:46 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't disable updates
21:47:55 <strcat[m]> the new update resolves the issue
21:48:10 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean by reset, but that won't have helped you at all
21:48:49 <strcat[m]> the solution was setting your date/time correctly
21:49:14 <strcat[m]> then getting the new update, and enabling network time again
21:49:15 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure why you ignored my answer, posted all that stuff, and reset...
21:49:16 <strcat[m]> and disabled updates...
21:49:36 <m2tu[m]> What are teh best dekstop setup for building  guys!
21:50:05 <m2tu[m]> i plan to buy a 12core cpu will it be enough ?
21:50:20 <strcat[m]> m2tu: sure, more cores is always better, but that's plenty
21:50:29 * giffgaff[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gysIuhRJyuQEicKzzkiBtGbh/message.txt >
21:50:37 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: nah, that didn't solve anything
21:50:41 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: and was totally unnecessary
21:50:53 <strcat[m]> the solution was going into Settings and setting the time
21:51:09 <m2tu[m]> ok.. will go for it
21:51:23 <m2tu[m]> what is normal building time generally for noraml good dekstop?
21:51:24 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: you didn't resolve anything, and by disabling updates, you're not going to get the fix for the issue you ran into 🤦
21:51:36 <m2tu[m]> right now fullbuild is about 5 houer and edit 10 minuts
21:51:53 <strcat[m]> m2tu: you aren't usually doing clean builds for development
21:51:59 <strcat[m]> you're usually doing incremental builds
21:52:36 <m2tu[m]> m target-files-package
21:52:42 <m2tu[m]> means incremental ?
21:52:47 <strcat[m]> no
21:52:54 <strcat[m]> building when you already built, without removing `out/`
21:52:57 <strcat[m]> is an incremental build
21:53:01 <m2tu[m]> ahaa.
21:53:05 <strcat[m]> the build system figures out what it has to rebuild
21:53:07 <strcat[m]> so it takes a minute
21:53:09 <strcat[m]> instead of an hour
21:53:20 <m2tu[m]> yeah thats what i do.. now takes 10-30 min to rebuild depend what i change
21:53:22 <strcat[m]> for a production release, you should ALWAYS do a clean build
21:53:41 <strcat[m]> m2tu: look at our build guide
21:53:46 <strcat[m]> it has 2 paths: production release and development
21:53:55 <strcat[m]> for production release you use target-files-package and then sign the release
21:54:02 <strcat[m]> for development, you really want a dedicated development device
21:54:05 <m2tu[m]> yeah i followed thee guide ... it was 1 misstake there bt i got around it
21:54:06 <strcat[m]> so you can avoid doing that
21:54:18 <strcat[m]> and just leave it unlocked + use non-signed builds on it
21:54:31 <strcat[m]> because then you can simply use `m` and flash the images
21:54:42 <strcat[m]> you skip assembling the target files package and the lengthy signing process
21:54:49 <m2tu[m]> ahaa.
21:55:04 <m2tu[m]> wopw so i i jsut do m .. i will nto lose my old release build ?
21:55:07 <strcat[m]> also for some things you can build for the emulator (look at the guide's coverage of those targets, etc.)
21:55:27 <strcat[m]> m2tu: if you don't remove `out/` you're reusing your existing build
21:55:38 <strcat[m]> m2tu: if you run `m` alone it just won't remake the target files package
21:55:49 <strcat[m]> the target files package is what the release.sh script uses as input
21:55:53 <strcat[m]> you only need it for signed releases
21:57:15 <m2tu[m]> yeaa i see ... i was afrid losing the old build so did not tryed yet
21:57:30 <m2tu[m]> but till do it from now, seems it will same lots of time
21:57:30 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: the 2021.02.06.05 release had a bug in the error handling code for time updates, which is resolved in 2021.02.07.17
21:57:40 <m2tu[m]> thanks so much for advises
21:57:45 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: the solution if you run into the edge case is manually setting the date/time properly and waiting for the 2021.02.07.17 release
21:57:57 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: after being on the 2021.02.07.17 release, the problem should be gone, and you can turn network time back on
21:58:35 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: that's what I explained to you, so I don't know why you wiped your data that way instead (quite odd way to reset too)
21:59:03 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: you did not resolve the issue, you may run into it again, and by disabling updates you have disabled receiving the upcoming fix...
21:59:52 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: I don't know how to make this any clearer: enable updates and if the unlikely scenario occurs that you run into the edge case again, don't reset your device, that doesn't fix it, just set the date properly
22:00:12 <strcat[m]> the upcoming update resolves the issue
22:00:31 <giffgaff[m]> I wiped the data over 2 hours ago.
22:00:35 <strcat[m]> the issue is not triggered by updating, rather, updating is going to fix it and prevent it from happening again
22:02:19 <alex-resist> strcat I see you're busy with other things, but would it be possible to announce (somewhere) when beta releases are available for testing? It might be a good idea to be able to trigger the update manually (before it happens automatically) so issues with the update process could be detected
22:02:22 <giffgaff[m]> That's for the info. I understand the issue now
22:03:11 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I did that with the past update
22:03:17 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: and left it for a day
22:03:26 <alex-resist> strcat you did it here, which I appreciate, but I might miss the announcement
22:03:46 <strcat[m]> atm my focus is on getting out the next release, which hopefully resolves the issue properly
22:03:54 <peculiarly_small> My phone has the 2021.02.06.05 release installed, but I haven't restarted my phone and fully installed it yet - will the 2021.02.07.17 release download / install over the current update it has installed? (sorry if the grammar is weird 😣)
22:03:58 <alex-resist> The current situation is that I do now have a Pixel 3a on beta, and I'm just waiting for the update to become available
22:04:03 <strcat[m]> peculiarly_small-hamster: no
22:04:05 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> alex-resist: The updates are also posted on Twitter
22:04:16 <strcat[m]> peculiarly_small-hamster: you have to boot into that first
22:04:25 <alex-resist> Pretty sure the beta availability is not announced on Twitter
22:04:28 <peculiarly_small> Okay, thank you!
22:04:37 <strcat[m]> in theory the Updater could know how to cancel an update and install another but it doesn't
22:04:45 <strcat[m]> one reason why is that if someone has a ridiculously slow connection
22:04:54 <strcat[m]> they may take ages to finish downloading one...
22:04:59 <strcat[m]> then another is released and it's cancelled
22:05:16 <strcat[m]> and I think it'd confuse people
22:05:32 <strcat[m]> for it to say the update is done, then cancel it, so if they reboot it's the same version as before the update
22:05:33 <giffgaff[m]> * Thanks for the info. I understand the issue now
22:05:52 <strcat[m]> maybe worth implementing but I think it's bad UX basically
22:08:07 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it's not really great if we get everyone to dl it all at once
22:08:17 <strcat[m]> for beta it's less important
22:08:37 <strcat[m]> so we could start explicitly asking for beta testing each release once it's pushed out to beta
22:08:58 <strcat[m]> but I'm not going to announce exactly when it's pushed to stable on twitter because it's good to have the downloads spread out over 4 hours
22:08:59 <alex-resist> strcat The situation is, I now have a separate phone on beta, and I might not notice the availability of an update because I won't be using it all the time
22:09:10 <alex-resist> strcat not announcing stable, but announcing beta
22:09:18 <strcat[m]> I know
22:09:54 <strcat[m]> I'm pretty stressed out atm from the latest round of attacks by Copperhead against us including threatening more of our contributors
22:10:08 <strcat[m]> a lot of that has been going on over the past few days
22:10:22 <alex-resist> strcat Yeah i understand, sorry to be bothering you with these petty issues. Those are just small ideas that might be worth implementing in the long run
22:10:41 <strcat[m]> we really need more help with Beta testing
22:11:24 <strcat[m]> meaning: a lot more people using the Beta channel that are going to be quickly reporting issues that are introduced in the new update to the issue tracker (not mentioning it here, reporting to the tracker, so we see it and can treat it as an issue)
22:11:41 <strcat[m]> so for example, when this new release it out
22:11:48 <strcat[m]> people who ran into that edge case are needed in particular
22:11:52 <strcat[m]> to verify it's fixed
22:12:09 <alex-resist> Ok, so a good next step for me would be to create an account so I could post issues on the tracker?
22:12:22 <alex-resist> I could absolutely do that
22:12:29 <strcat[m]> yes
22:12:49 <alex-resist> strcat ok good to know, I was always worried that this might flood you with irrelevant issues
22:13:06 <r0tt0r[m]> got the update and checked changelog, saw update to network time
22:13:08 <strcat[m]> I'll just close them if they're not relevant / wanted
22:13:20 <strcat[m]> easier than dealing with this chat
22:13:33 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: there's a new pending release coming soon
22:13:51 <alex-resist> strcat Ok good to know
22:14:31 <alex-resist> I'll try to keep a device for beta testing. I cannot run my main phone on beta because it's really important, I have Conversations, Signal, Wire etc. on that device for business purposes
22:15:50 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: there's a new pending re"> ok good to know indeed as the network time didnt work anymore
22:16:22 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: it's more likely that it wasn't working for you already
22:16:27 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: the issue is a broken error handling path
22:16:40 <strcat[m]> if it was working, you wouldn't have seen an issue with it
22:16:55 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: unless there is a bigger issue with it but most people are not running into this problem
22:17:03 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: indicates it wasn't working for you
22:17:08 <strcat[m]> or your connection is flaky
22:17:20 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: it's more likely that it"> hmm, it was working fine before though i have a ntp server in lan
22:17:39 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: it doesn't use that
22:17:52 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: we already had HTTPS-based network updates prior to the recent update
22:17:55 <strcat[m]> think you're confused
22:18:08 <strcat[m]> we don't use ntp, we didn't use ntp prior to the recent update either
22:18:16 <r0tt0r[m]> ye.i guess youre right
22:18:40 <strcat[m]> we changed how certificate validation is done and a more detailed error reporting path that was added wasn't done correctly
22:18:51 <strcat[m]> which results in it trying to use the time when it hasn't gotten one
22:18:59 <strcat[m]> that's the issue that we fixed for the next release
22:19:11 <strcat[m]> if you weren't hitting an error you wouldn't have had an issue
22:20:25 <pinguin74> after installin built 2021.02.06.05 i am welcomed as user "2", is this related to the slot a/b schema?
22:21:38 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: don't quite know what you mean
22:21:54 <strcat[m]> A/B slots have nothing to do with something like that
22:21:59 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "if you weren't hitting an error "> thx for clarifying on this. will check after next update if the time fetch in network will be fixed. appreciated much
22:22:12 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: which device are you on
22:22:18 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you could help by testing the release early
22:22:45 <r0tt0r[m]> im on beta chan, is there alpha?
22:23:04 <pinguin74> settings-->system--> "multi user" setings (dontknow the english term with english UI) there I am "logged in as 2"
22:23:21 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: I mean, you're able to rename users
22:23:29 <strcat[m]> the default user is called the Owner user
22:23:35 <strcat[m]> maybe the locale you're using has a broken string for it
22:23:56 <strcat[m]> try temporarily setting it to english
22:23:59 <strcat[m]> and see what it says
22:24:04 <strcat[m]> if it still says 2 you must have renamed it to 2
22:24:06 <pinguin74> i know, i just saw the user name changed after last update. ok, just a minor things. thanx
22:24:17 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: you could help by testin"> if brick is unlikely im directly up for it, else i need to prepare backup
22:24:30 <strcat[m]> don't need a backup
22:24:33 <strcat[m]> it just hopefully fixes time
22:24:42 <strcat[m]> may not, in which case, I'll roll back the prior change
22:24:45 <strcat[m]> and start the release over again
22:24:53 <strcat[m]> so I need to know early because that's a major deviation in what I'm working on
22:24:54 <r0tt0r[m]> ok
22:25:00 <strcat[m]> I don't want to do 12 hours of work then have to throw it away
22:25:21 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: which device?
22:25:38 <noobna[m]> <hobo0000[m] "Thats weird..🤔🤔🤔"> Proton mail is working fine for me
22:25:44 <strcat[m]> atm I have coral and sunfish built, building flame
22:25:52 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: which device?"> 4a
22:26:04 <r0tt0r[m]> sunfish
22:27:38 <r0tt0r[m]> ill just reboot with net time enable
22:28:53 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-ota_update-2021.02.07.17.zip
22:28:57 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: need to sideload I guess
22:29:15 <strcat[m]> really appreciate testing it
22:29:36 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: I think the fix should kick in as soon as you reboot
22:29:44 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you should leave network time off, before rebooting, I think
22:29:47 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: set the correct time
22:30:03 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: install the update, then enable network time after booting it up
22:30:11 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: it won't tell me anything if you don't do it that specific way
22:30:30 <strcat[m]> because if you have a broken network connection it may fail after reboot even with the fix
22:30:40 <strcat[m]> and that is what would have caused it originally
22:35:39 <r0tt0r[m]> yep ok, have the bug, time is wrong with netw time on. have set to manual now.will take some time for dl and sideload.
22:39:41 <r0tt0r[m]> short question as i never flashed the ota: just flash over or boot unlock etc needed?
22:40:29 <noobna[m]> <MottelMottel "Can you please recommed, secured"> There's proton calendar was just released today for plus users
22:48:23 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: use adb sideload
22:48:27 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you aren't flashing anything
22:48:49 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-sideloading
22:48:56 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you don't need USB debugging enabled in the OS
22:49:21 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: it would be good if you could tell me info about your network setup like if you use a VPN, Private DNS, etc. to try to figure out what caused this issue too
22:49:32 <strcat[m]> could do it in private message
22:49:34 <strcat[m]> rather than here
22:53:30 <skrillz[m]> So I set added a user profile instead of work but I can't add any apps to it, only owner is an admin
22:53:58 <strcat> skrillz[m]: that's not how it works
22:54:14 <strcat> skrillz[m]: you can install apps in a normal secondary user
22:55:00 <strcat> skrillz[m]: I think you're misinterpreting an error you're getting from trying to install an outdated version of an app when you already have a newer one installed in the existing profile
22:55:03 <strcat> you can't do that
22:55:19 <strcat> so, for example, F-Droid posts an outdated version of F-Droid as the main download on their site
22:55:39 <strcat> if you have a newer F-Droid installed you can't use that to install it in another profile, you need to download the up-to-date version
22:55:56 <strcat> if you provide more information, I can give a better answer, rather than guessing what you're doing
22:57:24 <skrillz[m]> Ah it was that from fdroid
22:57:28 <skrillz[m]> Thanks!
22:58:05 <strcat> skrillz[m]: yeah it is a gotcha with F-Droid because they don't update their download link
22:58:45 <strcat> has been that way for probably all 7 years I've worked on the project?
23:01:14 <r0tt0r[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "short question as i never flashe"> found the article on your site. went through with the update
23:01:16 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Wait... I thought it was more recent...
23:04:05 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: it would be good if you "> it works now, that was a quick time for fix
23:04:32 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: thanks for testing it
23:06:08 <strcat> r0tt0r[m]: can you also test that the seedvault ui opens?
23:06:13 <strcat> r0tt0r[m]: don't need to test that it works
23:06:25 <r0tt0r[m]> sure one sec
23:15:15 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat "r0tt0r: can you also test that t"> yes it works
23:17:20 <r0tt0r[m]> one improve: please include a search on your website would be quiet helpful as there is a lot of informations
23:19:31 <wrt[m]> Just installed - great work, thanks so much 🙏
23:20:14 <rny[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "one improve: please include a se"> whats wrong with `ctlr+f`?
23:20:48 <rny[m]> search engines also index the website, if you must just punch in quoted queries into google or something.
23:21:34 <r0tt0r[m]> <rny[m] "search engines also index the we"> oh ok if its indexed sure thats an option, ctrl f only works for current opened content
23:23:21 <rny[m]> so query: "connectivity check" "graphene os" gives very good results
23:23:30 <rny[m]> even gives some old IRC logs URL links LOL
23:23:40 <rny[m]> this is with Google Search Engine
23:24:11 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: well you can do
23:24:15 <strcat[m]> site:grapheneos.org search term
23:24:16 <strcat[m]> in google
23:24:23 <strcat[m]> and other search engines have similar
23:24:39 <strcat[m]> we can't easily include search because that's a service
23:25:00 <strcat[m]> also you'd want it to search text, not html code
23:26:16 <r0tt0r[m]> ye indeed working though i somehow mostly use the site directly and circumvent 3rd parties
23:26:38 <r0tt0r[m]> but indeed ok to use searchengine
23:33:09 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a Beta release is now available
23:33:18 <strcat[m]> should fix the time sync edge case for the few people running into that
23:33:22 <strcat[m]> testing appreciated.
23:33:43 <strcat[m]> not going to leave this stuff in Beta for long since there's already an issue to resolve
23:44:41 <strcat[m]> please test the Pixel 4a Beta, other devices coming soon
23:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> Setting my 4 for Beta, Captain.
23:53:51 <zelzek[m]> ill jump on a beta as well on my 4
23:55:05 <zelzek[m]> i have a mint 3axl that someone gave me, but unfortunately carrier locked to t-mobile as i'm assuming they didnt pay the lease so can't do much with it
23:56:42 <strcat[m]> zelzek: if you flash GrapheneOS on it shouldn't matter if it's carrier locked
23:56:47 <strcat[m]> take out the SIM before flashing
23:57:21 <zelzek[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: i pulled the sim, but when trying to hit the about 5x it won't let me unlock it.  unless flashboot will do it?
23:57:55 <strcat[m]> zelzek: try putting in another SIM and doing a factory reset
23:58:14 <strcat[m]> zelzek: also unregister it from Google account before reset
23:58:35 <zelzek[m]> it's not registered at all, i ensured of that. i have an h20/att sim lying around, standby
23:58:45 <strcat[m]> yeah so try putting in that other SIM
23:58:47 <strcat[m]> and doing factory reset
23:58:49 <strcat[m]> see what happens
