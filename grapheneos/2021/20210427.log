I have a task on a mobile phone tomake it so that there are two accounts:Admin -full access to the phone without restrictions.the admin is protected by a large, complex password.Guest-has access to the application that the Administrator will allow him.please tell me how this can be implemented?1) by means of the OS!2) using additional programs?I would really appreciate your help.

06:57:41 <SluttyAsian1> Hi
06:57:50 <SluttyAsian1> Which Pixel will have the longest security patches? Pixel 5?
06:57:54 <helloworldkk87[m> Hi
06:58:05 <SluttyAsian1> hi
06:58:13 <helloworldkk87[m> Pixel5 yes
07:00:42 <helloworldkk87[m> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
07:04:48 <SluttyAsian1> So how long will the Pixel 4A have support
07:04:51 <SluttyAsian1> compared to the 5
07:05:04 <helloworldkk87[m> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
07:05:43 <helloworldkk87[m> Check "Minimum update &¬†support periods" part of that article
07:05:50 <SluttyAsian1> Only 2 months more wilth Pix 5
07:06:10 <helloworldkk87[m> Thats the minimum
07:06:18 <SluttyAsian1> Yeah
07:06:24 <SluttyAsian1> They could stop on those days
07:06:48 <SluttyAsian1> What do you guys think will be best
07:06:54 <SluttyAsian1> Thats only like 2 year away :o
07:06:56 <SluttyAsian1> 2023
07:07:03 <helloworldkk87[m> Would wait for 5a to come soon
07:07:06 <SluttyAsian1> I think Im stuck in 2017
07:07:09 <SluttyAsian1> Why?
07:07:13 <SluttyAsian1> I dont need 5g btw
07:07:17 <SluttyAsian1> Ill set LTE only mode
07:07:24 <SluttyAsian1> is 5a cheaper?
07:07:29 <SluttyAsian1> Im seeking water resistance though
07:07:42 <helloworldkk87[m> 5a should be supported longer
07:08:14 <SluttyAsian1> True
07:08:17 <helloworldkk87[m> <SluttyAsian1 "Im seeking water resistance thou"> Oh, well 4a is not the option for you then:D not sure about 5a sence its not out there yet
07:08:27 <SluttyAsian1> It will take weeks/months to become Graphene supposed though right?
07:08:36 <SluttyAsian1> I think Pixel 5 Will be best, because of water resistance
07:08:43 <SluttyAsian1> Does Lte only mode disable 5g?
07:08:44 <SluttyAsian1> On Pixel 5
07:08:47 <SluttyAsian1> I want to turn off 5g
07:08:51 <helloworldkk87[m> <SluttyAsian1 "It will take weeks/months to bec"> Yes
07:08:51 <SluttyAsian1> and only have 4g LTE
07:08:52 <SluttyAsian1> on
07:09:05 <SluttyAsian1> I'll consider Pixel 5 Then
07:09:05 <helloworldkk87[m> <SluttyAsian1 "Does Lte only mode disable 5g?"> I think so yes but not sure
07:09:14 <SluttyAsian1> I want to avoid the 5g
07:09:21 <SluttyAsian1> Hey
07:09:28 <SluttyAsian1> I have a story on police interception of cell phone

07:29:55 <dazinism> Baha_Koks: can do something like that with Device Policy Control - theres a testing app where you can see what you can control - but the user you are trying to restrict will have access and can change the settings
07:29:58 <dazinism> https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc
07:30:41 <dazinism> I imagine there are parental control apps that use this Android functionality to achieve something like you want
07:32:26 <dazinism> I think the app you use has to have full control of the device. So you need to trust it
07:34:28 <dazinism> ...actually it may be possible to write the app so it only has control of the user profile you want to restrict
07:35:09 <dazinism> Depends how the app developers have implemented it.
07:41:18 <dazinism> Its actually not full control, but it is lots of power over the user/users

08:27:27 <Patrick[m]4> Hey! Not sure if this has been asked/answered before, but what proprietary software components remain in GrapheneOS? Is it just the firmware / drivers located on the vendor partition?
08:30:03 <starter> Is graphene os officially available for Redmi Note 6 pro?
08:30:55 <starter> I couldn't find it on website.
08:31:21 <jasperweiss[m]> starter: no it‚Äôs not. See https://grapheneos.org/faq
08:33:05 <starter> I would like to develop grapheneOS for Redmi Note 6 pro. I am totally new. No experience at all. Any tutorial or links to help me develop and how to go about it?
08:37:16 <nscnt[m]> starter: There are certain requirements for future devices so that there can be official GrapheneOS releases for them https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices

10:29:15 <jjstopper[m]> Question please. Is there anything in the latest Grapheneos update that could cause problems with a VPN? My VPN works fine on WiFi but not on cellular. Openvpn just updated this weekend too
10:35:26 <jpds> jjstopper[m]: Everything is fine with my WireGuard VPN
10:40:19 <jjstopper[m]> jpds: thanks
10:55:06 <guenni[m]> Question: VPN mode in Orbot doesn't work on my Pixel 3a, no problem on Pixel 4a. Any suggestions what's the problem?
11:00:16 <arcibald[m]> So, if I give phone with Graphene to my employee and he go on other side of earth - update can make it his phone/vpn/orbot/communication stops work. And I can't do anything remote. This don't sounds good to me. ü§î
11:03:27 <jpds> arcibald[m]: Are you referring to the messages above?
11:03:31 <nscnt[m]> arcibald: Which is probably not even true
11:03:59 <arcibald[m]> <jpds "arcibald: Are you referring to t"> Yes.
11:04:29 <jpds> arcibald[m]: Yeah, that's just nonsense, as I said, my VPN is fine
11:05:41 <arcibald[m]> I read your msg, thanks. I think and choose now between openvpn and wireguard.
11:06:17 <arcibald[m]> Maybe there is some problem with last update and openvpn. I don't know.
11:06:55 <arcibald[m]> I just don't want to be in that situation - my employee lost connection and I can do anything remote to help him.
11:08:13 <arcibald[m]> * can't
11:09:05 <jpds> arcibald[m]: Then give them a laptop as well
11:10:17 <arcibald[m]> <jpds "arcibald: Then give them a lapto"> Laptop isn't option.
11:11:04 <jpds> Well, their phone battery could simply stop working while they're overseas
11:11:17 <jpds> Anyhow, -offtopic
11:13:17 <arcibald[m]> They can recharge phone battery. I am here becouse of grapheneos, so we need mobile devices.
11:15:40 <jpds> arcibald[m]: You can't recharge a dead battery
11:16:47 <arcibald[m]> jpds: They get new device, there are small chances to that. :)
11:17:07 <arcibald[m]> Sorry for offtopic. üñê
11:17:17 <guenni[m]> VPN mode in Orbot doesn't work: the wireguard vpn has been in always-on mode, so the VPN mode in Orbot was blocked. Problem solved!
11:17:34 <jpds> arcibald[m]: Are you then going to get that employee to install grapheneos remotely?
11:18:46 <arcibald[m]> jpds: No. They will get their phones in company already installed and configured.
11:21:43 <guenni[m]> Some countries block vpn connections?!
11:29:44 <guenni[m]>  * Some countries block vpn connections
11:33:13 <secrypt[m]> arcibald: I have a custom vpn app which works with push configurations
11:45:11 <guenni[m]> <arcibald[m] "I read your msg, thanks. I think"> I'm running a wireguard server for more than 1 year and had no major issues; wireguard is modern, easier to set up and maintain, faster and more secure than openvpn (imho); but I'm using QR codes to set up the clients, don't know if there's a push service yet
11:47:59 <jjstopper[m]> Please be patient with this question. Since I'm new to Grapheneos (I love it!). Is there anything in a Grapheneos update or at least the latest update that could affect a VPN?
11:49:02 <jpds> jjstopper[m]: Doesn't look like it: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.04.22.20
11:49:24 <jpds> jjstopper[m]: You should start by looking at any log output the app gives you
11:51:10 <jjstopper[m]> jpds: thanks I'm looking into all that and have conyact with the VPN's provider. For now I switched to PIA downloading the apk and it works great. Does downloading PIA's apk present any privacy problems with a new Grapheneos install?
11:57:52 <GhostSplinterSix> <jjstopper[m] "Please be patient with this ques"> I have a VPN and everything has been running perfectly fine.
11:58:16 <helloworldkk87[m> <jjstopper[m] "Please be patient with this ques"> No

14:19:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, yes, my bad, sorry
14:21:24 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Might need to wait for somebody who builds GrapheneOS to answer, but you might want to check the sync commands done earlier in terminal and compare it to grapheneos.org/build
14:22:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hey DHFuchsiaOSwhen
14:23:53 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> My experience on syncing (in Chromium) is I had to check if the git checkout and sync is done right prior to building it
14:26:56 <deadlydata[m]> i fixed it, was package related
14:27:11 <deadlydata[m]> was building the kernal i thought i missed something
14:27:14 <deadlydata[m]> but it was something on the os.
14:29:57 <deadlydata[m]> hey
14:30:01 <deadlydata[m]> Select the desired build target (aosp_sunfish is the Pixel 4a):
14:30:21 <deadlydata[m]> would the build target for blue line be aosp_blueline

14:37:56 <deadlydata[m]> yep myself saved the day
14:38:00 <deadlydata[m]> allways the case.
14:38:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Mostly, the pattern is if it's os, aosp_{devicealias}, if kernel, {devicealias} (like what you did)
14:38:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Congrats ^^
14:39:45 <deadlydata[m]> Thanks Homie
14:51:54 <phone> Hello
14:52:32 <phone> Is there a oppertunity to push graphene to a Samsung j5 ??
14:55:36 <helloworldkk87[m> No. They need to have ability to install the OS, standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available. Devices also need to have decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components such as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image processor, etc
14:55:51 <helloworldkk87[m> Oh
15:04:46 <thomashensel[m]> Well congrats GrapheOS team with 4 Messengers and no tweaks beyond setting all apps that can to OLED/Dark Mode i get like 3+ days of battery life out of my Pixel 3a. That's quite impressive
15:05:39 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. My 4a has a lot of battery life, too. ü§ìüëç
15:12:34 <LinusSexTips[m]> yet techlore would have you believe that battery life is worse than stock lmao
15:13:38 <thomashensel[m]> I don't know what stock battery life is and i don't know how&what techlore tested. I can only say that for my usecase and setup the battery life is great
15:16:56 <strcat[m]> we enable the app compaction and app freezer options along with the same modern power management features as the stock OS
15:17:11 <strcat[m]> other non-stock OSes tend not to enable those features that the stock OS offers
15:17:31 <strcat[m]> so despite not bundling a hundred apps and Play services they reduce battery life
15:18:09 <strcat[m]> our hardening features don't increase battery usage measurably for normal use cases
15:18:14 <deadlydata[m]> hey strcat  i'm getting these warning: tag "wm_on_paused_called" (30021) duplicated in frameworks/base/core/java/android/app/EventLogTags.logtags:9

15:19:21 <deadlydata[m]> it's just warning me about duplicate files
15:19:25 <strcat[m]> probably broken change, incomplete sync, or broken build environment
15:19:32 <strcat[m]> can't really help

15:20:48 <deadlydata[m]> ah ok
15:20:53 <deadlydata[m]> awesome everything is fine then i guess
15:20:57 <strcat[m]> some log tags are defined in 2 places
15:21:06 <strcat[m]> it shouldn't be repeating that or spamming it though
15:21:13 <strcat[m]> it's just an AOSP thing
15:22:02 <deadlydata[m]> should i expect allot of warnings?
15:22:10 <deadlydata[m]> i've got lots of weird ones that don't make no sense
15:22:15 <deadlydata[m]> like unused parameter flags

16:09:20 <bluebird> is it a known issue that the update client won't update if flight mode on + wlan on?
16:27:41 <bluebird> I also noticed that if I activate the camera without unlocking the phone then turn off the screen and then if there is a missed call the phone will go back to camera mode and the screen will stay on forever
16:37:29 <strcat[m]> > I also noticed that if I activate the camera without unlocking the phone then turn off the screen and then if there is a missed call the phone will go back to camera mode and the screen will stay on forever
16:37:30 <strcat[m]> not really clear what you mean
16:38:21 <strcat[m]> the camera uses a wake lock to keep the screen on since using the camera is considered to be doing something with the device even if you aren't interacting with it
16:38:34 <strcat[m]> that happens regardless of lock screen state, other apps, etc.
16:38:38 <nscnt[m]> <bluebird "is it a known issue that the upd"> No, because it's a non-existent issue
16:39:06 <strcat[m]> the screen / device won't sleep if you're using an app that has a screen wake lock
16:39:11 <strcat[m]> like watching a movie, or using a camera app
16:39:24 <strcat[m]> you're choosing to do it
16:52:16 <bluebird> I turned the screen OFF after using the camera
17:09:31 <strcat[m]> bluebird: but it's still open, so if the screen/device turns on again, it's there, focused in foreground, with wake lock
17:09:37 <strcat[m]> that's not really unexpected
17:09:46 <strcat[m]> the Camera app would have to specifically handle that special case

17:23:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's a user error
17:23:23 <souvlaki[m]> and yeah, afaik you have to grant "Phone" permission in order to allow app to read your phone number

17:30:38 <souvlaki[m]> phone# is not a part of that, hardware identificators can be read by any apps apart of any permissions unless Daniel made some modifications to spoof them
17:31:28 <bizanon[m]> <souvlaki[m] "phone# is not a part of that, ha"> you're dodging the question. ofc even sites accessed by vanadium can identify phone hardware. not just apps
17:32:28 <souvlaki[m]> phone number is not a hardware identificator. does that answer your question?
17:32:50 <souvlaki[m]> you have to toggle phone permission for app to access it

17:39:36 <panoramics[m]> Hey guys, quick question: how would you give granular access to your pictures? For example, I have a gallery where everything sensitive is stored but I want one specific app to only access the pictures that I allow it, not all of them. Can this be achieved? Thanks a lot
17:41:13 <bizanon[m]> <panoramics[m] "Hey guys, quick question: how wo"> yea u can do app specific permission
17:41:32 <skwisgaar[m]> bizanon: https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
17:41:36 <bizanon[m]> <souvlaki[m] "file permissions have nothing to"> glad we solved our differences. I think you are right about enabling phone. I think thats what I did last time
17:43:17 <souvlaki[m]> <bizanon[m] "image.png"> Android 10 (API level 29) adds restrictions for non-resettable identifiers, which include both IMEI and serial number. Your app must be a device or profile owner app, have special carrier permissions, or have the READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE privileged permission in order to access these identifiers.
17:52:33 <panoramics[m]> <bizanon[m] "yea u can do app specific permis"> What exactly do you mean? How could I give let's say signal only permission to access certain photos?
17:53:38 <bizanon[m]> <panoramics[m] "What exactly do you mean? How co"> Oh I think one way is have all your sensitive photos inside a profile. And install signal on that profile
17:54:00 <bizanon[m]> Sorry I don't know a better way
17:59:06 <souvlaki[m]> <bizanon[m] "Sorry I don't know a better way"> don't think you have other way - Android does not allow selective permissions for certain files like ios does afaik
17:59:44 <deadlydata[m]> hi
18:00:03 <deadlydata[m]> im trying to generate a signify key for signing factory images
18:00:08 <deadlydata[m]> and i'm getting the error Signify: Unknown parameter '-G'
18:00:19 <deadlydata[m]> for the command signify -G -n -p keys/sunfish/factory.pub -s keys/sunfish/factory.sec
18:00:54 <Pratyush[m]> May be try signify-openbsd or remove -G prams
18:01:09 <deadlydata[m]> maybe i have old version of Signify
18:01:16 <deadlydata[m]> let me try getting without apt-get
18:01:21 <Pratyush[m]> If you are on ubuntu or something similar signify-openbsd is your best bet
18:01:37 <deadlydata[m]> ah ok
18:01:46 <deadlydata[m]> signify-openbsd seems to be the solution i guess then
18:01:48 <deadlydata[m]> let me try
18:02:16 <deadlydata[m]> worked
18:02:17 <deadlydata[m]> thanks
18:03:14 <Pratyush[m]> Your welcome üòâ
18:10:18 <panoramics[m]> <bizanon[m] "Oh I think one way is have all y"> Could I store pictures in different gallery's and give gallery specific access? Also probably not I guess
18:13:28 <pikey[m]> anyone know how to do new line / carriage return in SMS app?
18:36:56 <pix5> have small prob hope somebody can help me here
18:38:00 <pix5> i just tried to install graphenos on a nex pixel 5 and i got stucked with a Error: Timeout of 10000 ms exceeded
18:38:27 <pix5> Flashing factory images
18:38:27 <pix5> is where it happend
18:38:40 <pix5> any idea wat i need do now?
18:40:22 <pix5> i have had same kid of issue with a pixel 3 wat i trown away but hope somebody can heeeeelllppp
18:41:47 <pix5> i just the web installer
18:42:01 <pix5> just is used
18:48:49 <nscnt[m]> pix5: Try a different cable/port
18:49:34 <pix5> the cable is the original cable wat came with the phone
18:49:44 <nscnt[m]> Try a different cable/port
18:50:16 <pix5> but wat do i need do now start again from the beginniing or wat to do?
18:50:23 <pix5> device is unlocked
18:50:58 <nscnt[m]> pix5: You can start from to beginning, yes. It will just verify that it's already unlocked etc. It's good to make sure you have a working connection from the beginning
18:52:33 <pix5> so need refresh page and do again?
18:53:00 <pix5> cause when staying on same page its showing the error all the time
18:54:36 <nscnt[m]> pix5: Refresh would be fine, yes
18:55:24 <pix5> ok thanks trying again
19:04:51 <pix5> it just dont do annything by flashing factory images
19:05:54 <pix5> the timer down is full blue so i geus its finished but the device didnt flashed or rebooted
19:09:53 <mintsauce[m]> I am trying to install with web installer on P5. The download of redfin was really slow and now says "error undefined".  What should I do? Unplug phone, refresh page? Thanks
19:10:30 <strcat[m]> sounds like the download failed or you ran out of space
19:10:36 <strcat[m]> the servers are really fast so it's not an issue with those
19:10:55 <strcat[m]> you need to have a fair bit of memory and disk space
19:10:56 <mintsauce[m]> Thanks but definitely not run out of space on macbook.
19:11:07 <strcat[m]> don't use incognito mode
19:11:13 <strcat[m]> limits the usable space too much
19:11:13 <mintsauce[m]> Unless its actually dowblaoding to phone but even then its stock so should have space
19:11:24 <strcat[m]> it's not downloading to the phone
19:11:40 <mintsauce[m]> Fresh install of chromium just for this. Stock settings
19:12:02 <mintsauce[m]> Using a VPN on macbook but can't see that would cause issue
19:14:05 <mintsauce[m]> I clicked to download again and see what happens. I have 80mbps download speed and it was VERY slow. As in 20 mins to get download progress bar to 5-10%   then failed
19:14:24 <strcat[m]> something wrong with your connection / browser / computer
19:14:46 * strcat[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/hDbUccIpiLbYIuGToMCEusJh/message.txt >
19:15:04 <strcat[m]> 10s download, 107MB/s
19:15:29 <flawedworld[m]> <mintsauce[m] "Using a VPN on macbook but can't"> If possible try switch IP addresses // servers // location on your VPN
19:15:33 <strcat[m]> there are 2 releases servers, each 2gbit unlimited bandwidth, and there is barely any load on them atm
19:16:24 <mintsauce[m]> Thanks. Catalina running perfectly. Chromium first time user so stock install. Ethernet connection @80 download. I have a Pixel 3 running graphene now. Am I right in thinking its possible to flash it pixel to pixel to remove the macbook from the equation?
19:16:34 <strcat[m]> yes
19:16:41 <strcat[m]> you can do it from Vanadium
19:17:03 <strcat[m]> it's a bit more annoying since you have to re-authorize USB access after each reboot of the device (it's easy enough) and it's slower
19:17:04 <strcat[m]> but it works fine
19:17:05 <mintsauce[m]> Cool. Seems weird to me to use a phone for this but I am game!!
19:17:15 <mintsauce[m]> Great thanks
19:17:23 <mintsauce[m]> So USBC to USBC?
19:17:36 <strcat[m]> yes
19:17:37 <strcat[m]> and just use Vanadium, non-incognito
19:17:42 <mintsauce[m]> Roger
19:17:50 <strcat[m]> incognito issue is that it uses memory instead of disk space for the storage and it doesn't allow using enough space
19:17:59 <strcat[m]> unless you have > 128GB or so system memory
19:18:11 <strcat[m]> the arbitrary limit is just too low
19:18:34 <strcat[m]> it scales with system memory but... super slowly
19:18:40 <strcat[m]> so incognito just doesn't really work for it atm
19:22:04 <mintsauce[m]> Ah I see thanks
19:22:45 <mintsauce[m]> I am currently letting the second attempt on macbook chromium complete. Bit scared to unplug phone now. Can't afford a 400 dollar brick!
19:23:05 <strcat[m]> it doesn't do anything with the phone beyond asking it the model until you start flashing
19:23:09 <strcat[m]> and it's safe to stop at any point
19:23:15 <strcat[m]> if the USB connection drops, etc. it's fine
19:23:22 <strcat[m]> at most you just have to flash again
19:23:32 <strcat[m]> since it won't have an OS
19:24:53 * mintsauce[m] uploaded an image: (88KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ffrDSosdZXNGwocsLzduTbxM/20210427_202430_3041873741792053263.jpg >
19:25:02 <mintsauce[m]> This is after fifteen minutes at least
19:25:20 <strcat[m]> there's just something wrong with your connection / computer / browser
19:25:22 <strcat[m]> just stop it
19:25:26 <strcat[m]> it's not doing anything with the phone
19:25:43 <strcat[m]> we have no rate limits on downloads just fair load balancing
19:25:56 <mintsauce[m]> OK so stop. OK to just unplug phone while its in fast boot mode?
19:26:03 <strcat[m]> sure
19:26:07 <strcat[m]> just do it from your phone
19:26:09 <mintsauce[m]> Thanks
19:26:13 <jj1013[m]> <mintsauce[m] "OK so stop. OK to just unplug ph"> Yup.
19:28:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> panoramics[m]: still here?
19:28:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> a simple solution to your problem is "share"
19:29:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in the gallery (or files) app select the photo you want to share with signal and just press "share"
19:30:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this way you don't have to give "all files access" permission to signal
19:30:52 <jack> can new motorola phones work with gapheneos?
19:31:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> jack: hello, please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
19:36:05 <jack> thank you
19:36:19 <pix5> installing on pixel 5 with the web installer::¬† first i got a error now seccond time i did all again and it keeps writting bootloader for about 15-20 min now
19:36:34 <pix5> how long does this takes before flashing and reboot?
19:37:25 <jack> there seems to be security concerns with older phones.¬† is it highly recommended i get the pixel 5 over the 4 or 4a?
19:37:28 <strcat[m]> pix5: a minute
19:37:36 <strcat[m]> jack: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
19:37:43 <strcat[m]> pix5: sounds like you don't have a reliable USB connection
19:37:56 <strcat[m]> pix5: disconnect the phone and reboot it back to the bootloader interface, that's safe
19:38:08 <strcat[m]> don't try to keep going without rebooting it back to bootloader interface first
19:38:13 <pix5> i have put it eith original cable in my mac pro
19:38:27 <strcat[m]> pix5: well, it still seems USB connection dropped
19:38:31 <Pratyush[m]> pix5  Normally it's should not take a lot of time once rom/firmware is downloaded.
19:38:32 <Pratyush[m]> If it stuck on flashing bootloader changing usb cable or port is good fix
19:38:38 <strcat[m]> the original USB-C to USB-C cable?
19:38:54 <pix5> yes
19:38:56 <strcat[m]> the USB connection dropped if it's stalled
19:39:06 <strcat[m]> which indicates the cable or computer port is screwed up
19:39:18 <strcat[m]> or the cable wasn't fully pushed in and got disconnected
19:39:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> there was a person having trouble with installing over chromium browser before, the solution was to use the chrome browser (for some reason it worked)
19:39:51 <strcat[m]> that's not accurate unless they're on Ubuntu and use their broken Snap package
19:39:53 <strcat[m]> Chromium works fine
19:39:58 <strcat[m]> Ubuntu has a broken Chromium package
19:40:04 <strcat[m]> it's covered in the guide
19:40:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> pix5: just in case if you have any browser extensions please disable those first
19:40:31 <pix5> i am using the google chrome browser
19:40:41 <strcat[m]> also please note Chromium itself does not do releases and so distributions of Chromium are from your OS distribution, etc.
19:41:00 <strcat[m]> the guide says which OSes / browsers are officially supported
19:41:09 <strcat[m]> and say that Chromium on Ubuntu is broken (Ubuntu problem, not a Chromium problem)
19:41:21 <strcat[m]> (they provide a broken build / package)
19:41:33 <pix5> so i need disconect the phone restart and it will go again in fastboot mode?
19:41:38 <strcat[m]>  * and says that Chromium on Ubuntu is broken (Ubuntu problem, not a Chromium problem)
19:41:44 <pix5> phone is unlocked
19:42:08 <strcat[m]> pix5: disconnect the phone, then either use the option to reboot back to bootloader interface in the fastboot menu, or reboot it and hold the volume button to make it boot back to there as before
19:42:25 <strcat[m]> connect it to a different port, make sure the connector is pushed all the way in, make sure no dirt, etc. is in it
19:42:37 <strcat[m]> and just try flashing again
19:42:42 <strcat[m]> no need to download again
19:43:01 <pix5> ok will do now thanks
19:43:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jack "there seems to be security conce"> There are no security concerns
19:43:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> By buying an older phone you get shorter support periods
19:44:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also you miss out on some hardware security features a newer model would have
19:44:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> This does not automatically make older phone insecure
19:44:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> * This does not automatically make older phones insecure
19:45:12 <pix5> i am right when saying it needs to flash and reboot after writting bootloader correct?
19:45:48 <Pratyush[m]> I guess yes.
19:45:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should get the latest model that is available and supported by grapheneos for the best security
19:46:30 <jack> is 5g safe?¬† Can't anyone locate me if I use 5g?
19:46:36 <strcat[m]> pix5: it writes it (sends it to the device), then flashes it, then it'd reboot
19:46:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Networks are insecure jack
19:46:49 <strcat[m]> jack: not really 'anyone'
19:46:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> 5g doesn't change that
19:46:57 <strcat[m]> jack: read https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
19:47:09 <jack> ok thank you
19:47:26 <strcat[m]> 5G does not really add tracking concerns that were not present with 4G, it may allow more precise location detection in some cases but it could already be pretty accurate
19:47:32 <pix5> so it keeps again writing bootloader..¬† ¬†any other ideas?
19:47:59 <strcat[m]> pix5: not a reliable USB connection then, or it'd be finishing writing and then flashing it
19:48:14 <strcat[m]> reboot the phone back to bootloader interface, reboot your computer
19:48:21 <strcat[m]> try a port on the back if you're using a port on the front
19:48:41 <secrypt[m]> Don't use USBC to USBC
19:48:48 <secrypt[m]> Do USB to USBC
19:48:50 <pix5> i have a mackbook pro and only have 2 on the leftside
19:49:05 <secrypt[m]> Issue is USBC to USBC I bet.
19:49:17 <pix5> aaah ok
19:49:22 <strcat[m]> USB-C to USB-C is fine
19:49:32 <strcat[m]> most USB-A to USB-C cables are not reliable
19:49:42 <strcat[m]> USB-C to USB-C is recommended if you have proper ports
19:49:44 <pix5> lett me find a usb then
19:50:00 <pix5> its new phone and new mackbook
19:50:02 <strcat[m]> pix5: I would try rebooting phone back to bootloader interface again but reboot your computer too this time
19:50:05 <secrypt[m]> strcat I experience the opposite. Its weird best to try everything lol
19:50:10 <mintsauce[m]> Hey strcat
19:50:15 <mintsauce[m]> Panic!
19:50:17 <strcat[m]> secrypt: some computers have broken USB-C ports but not macbooks
19:50:35 <strcat[m]> and it mostly applies to early generation USB-C ports on computers
19:50:41 <secrypt[m]> mintsauce: sup
19:50:42 <strcat[m]> not current gen computers
19:50:56 <secrypt[m]> <strcat[m] "not current gen computers"> True
19:50:58 <jack> is there a good maps solution in gapheneos that has traffic data?
19:51:36 <entry1> <jack "is there a good maps solution in"> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
19:51:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google maps works without GMS
19:52:05 <mintsauce[m]> Went through exactly as described. Locked bootloader then pressed power button to start phone. Says  on phone screen 'can't find valid OS the device will not start'
19:52:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can also use it inside vanadium
19:52:23 <souvlaki[m]> osmand is fine in most cases
19:52:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> mintsauce: unlock and retry
19:53:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Rarely it can happen that the os gets corrupted during the flash
19:53:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's best practice to avoid touching or moving the phone
19:53:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mostly this is due to a bad usb cable, port or driver
19:53:46 <mintsauce[m]> Thanks. Yes we were religious. Nothing touched phone and cable definitely good. Will try again. Scary!
19:53:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> mintsauce: nothing scary about it
19:54:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw see if you can boot to recovery mode first
19:54:26 <mintsauce[m]> OK. In old days on Linux it was scary and that fear carries over!
19:54:42 <mintsauce[m]> Trying recov mode
19:54:55 <mintsauce[m]> No valid OS
19:54:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> mintsauce: there's nothing scary.
19:55:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah ok
19:55:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unlock again
19:55:17 <mintsauce[m]> So just plug in and start again!
19:55:21 <mintsauce[m]> Unlock what?
19:55:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Retry the flash from step 1
19:55:24 <strcat[m]> mintsauce: sounds like you didn't really finish flashing but rather got an error and locked despite that
19:55:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <mintsauce[m] "Unlock what?"> Turn off the phone
19:55:40 <mintsauce[m]> Ok
19:55:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Volume down + plug it in
19:55:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Restart the installation again
19:55:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> No need to panic
19:56:14 <strcat[m]> mintsauce: sounds like you only really flashed the base OS and interrupted it during fastbootd
19:56:17 <mintsauce[m]> <strcat[m] "mintsauce: sounds like you didn'"> It finished doing anything abd got to bootloadee
19:56:23 <strcat[m]> please carefully read the full flashing instructions
19:56:23 <mintsauce[m]> Thanks
19:56:49 <strcat[m]> mintsauce: once it flashes the base stuff, it boots to fastbootd mode, and then flashes most of the OS, then boots back to bootloader
19:56:53 <mintsauce[m]> <strcat[m] "please carefully read the full f"> I am more careful than you can imagine. Honest. Read three tines before starting
19:57:00 <strcat[m]> if you interrupted that by interacting with the menu it won't have finished
19:57:08 <strcat[m]> (as in rebooting from there, etc.)
19:57:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> mintsauce: unless you turn off OEM unlocking yourself after booting on a locked bootloader
19:57:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is no way to destroy your phone
19:57:29 <Thatcher[m]> <mintsauce[m] "I am more careful than you can i"> Read 4 times
19:57:31 <mintsauce[m]> What actually happened at the end is it disconnected and wouldn't reconnect no matter what
19:57:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> So just follow the installation steps again
19:57:41 <strcat[m]> mintsauce: what do you mean at the end?
19:57:44 <strcat[m]> did it say it finished?
19:57:52 <strcat[m]> it sounds like it didn't finish flashing but then you locked
19:57:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> mintsauce: ok no need for more explanation
19:58:00 <strcat[m]> you need to unlock and fully flash, then lock
19:58:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Start the flash again
19:58:12 <mintsauce[m]> Will do thanks
19:58:23 <strcat[m]> you didn't actually flash most of the OS, you just flashed base stuff, it got interrupted (maybe USB connection dropped) and then you locked
19:58:24 <strcat[m]> that's the issue
19:58:43 <souvlaki[m]> from fastboot issue "oem flashing unlock", flash, then " oem flashing lock"
19:58:46 <strcat[m]> so, it's fine, just unlock, flash again, and make sure it actually finishes
19:58:51 <strcat[m]> it will say that it finishes, it's not supposed to stall
19:58:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> souvlaki: no
19:59:02 <mintsauce[m]> Gotcha trying again thanks very much
19:59:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't recommend users to do that
19:59:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also you typed the command wrong
19:59:21 <strcat[m]> souvlaki: that's not the syntax for the command these days and it's not how they're installing (they're using web installer)
19:59:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Users should not run arbitrary commands other than what is in our guide unless specifically told to by a developer
20:00:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Users should not run arbitrary commands other than what is in our guide unless specifically told to do so by a developer
20:00:08 <souvlaki[m]> gotta check out web installer, used to flash my graphene manually from fastboot
20:00:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also fastboot oem unlock is an OEM command
20:00:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some OEMs like OnePlus implement and redirect it to fastboot flashing unlock
20:00:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it is no longer a valid or standard command
20:01:21 <souvlaki[m]> i see, i flashed mine like 9 months ago or so
20:01:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> souvlaki: anyway please don't suggest unofficial methods
20:02:08 <souvlaki[m]> all right, i'm sorry
20:02:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only developers should be doing that and only when they have decided there's a proper reason to require it
20:03:02 <strcat[m]> souvlaki: ypi
20:03:12 <strcat[m]>  * souvlaki: you're probably just misremembering the syntax
20:03:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you feel you can improve our guides then send a pull request instead
20:03:20 <strcat[m]> the way you typed it is the really old way it's done
20:03:25 <strcat[m]> souvlaki: from a few years ago
20:03:40 <strcat[m]> the `oem` went away
20:03:44 <strcat[m]> since it got standardized
20:04:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "the `oem` went away"> Oh no /s
20:04:01 <strcat[m]> `oem` is for the vendor extensions
20:04:06 <souvlaki[m]> probably, maybe i used fastboot for that
20:04:33 <souvlaki[m]> there was no web installer back then
20:04:55 <strcat[m]> souvlaki: I mean even if you did it 9 months ago it wouldn't have used `oem`
20:05:03 <strcat[m]> but that's how it was done on Nexus 5X, etc.
20:05:08 <strcat[m]> don't remember exactly
20:05:55 <souvlaki[m]> yep, i used to modify/build nexus 6p kernels much back in time, so guess i remember it that way
20:05:57 <jack43> there's no one in off topic maps...¬† Is it safe to install google maps on gapheneos?
20:06:22 <strcat[m]> they meant #grapheneos-offtopic
20:06:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jack43 "there's no one in off topic maps"> You can use it in vanadium
20:06:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> It works as a webapp
20:07:24 <souvlaki[m]> or you can use osmand which i use, it has traffic highlighting
20:07:33 <souvlaki[m]> it's in fdroid
20:07:46 <jack43> thank you
20:08:21 <pix5> hi guys just wanted lett know hat i managed to install it now after changing usbc-usbc.¬† for a usb-usbc
20:08:25 <pix5> thanks a lott
20:08:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> souvlaki jack43  #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:08:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> We had enough here
20:09:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Both of you have been asked by 2 moderators to go to OT
20:09:08 <pix5> annybody knows what is this?¬† ¬†Replacing GrapheneOS with the stock OS
20:09:25 <strcat[m]> pix5: that's if you want to remove GrapheneOS
20:09:28 <strcat[m]> don't do that
20:09:46 <strcat[m]> if you do that and then lock it won't boot because it wipes the verified boot key
20:10:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I think he did that previously
20:10:33 <pix5> aaah ok so if i want to complete wipe the phone and reinstall graphene thats the way to do?
20:10:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
20:10:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't touch that button at all
20:10:54 <pix5> lol
20:11:12 <strcat[m]> it's for doing what it says: as part of replacing GrapheneOS with the stock OS
20:11:21 <strcat[m]> because the stock OS flashing tools will not remove that key
20:11:28 <pix5> so wats a option to completly wipe the device in case somebody would want do that?
20:11:31 <strcat[m]> which isn't mandatory but we provide what is required to revert back to the stock OS fully
20:11:36 <strcat[m]> pix5: factory reset
20:11:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pix5 "so wats a option to completly wi"> You are just misunderstanding
20:11:49 <strcat[m]> either via recovery (wipe data option) or the OS (which just reboots to recovery and does that)
20:11:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos flashes the entire OS
20:12:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also you have verified boot
20:12:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> So there's no need to wipe
20:12:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> * So there's no need to "fully wipe"
20:12:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Factory reset is enough
20:12:46 <pix5> ok
20:13:31 <pix5> disable OEM unlocking cant do cause developer settings are gone
20:13:51 <pix5> is this necesarry to do regarding security?
20:14:13 <strcat[m]> it's recommended to do that and then to disable developer options again after
20:14:19 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't be there if it wasn't recommended
20:14:23 <strcat[m]> it's certainly possible
20:14:40 <strcat[m]> enable developer options again, disable OEM unlock and disable developer options
20:14:43 <strcat[m]> that's the recommendation
20:14:51 <strcat[m]>  * enable developer options again, disable OEM unlocking and disable developer options
20:14:55 <pix5> so i need enable developer options again the same way.¬† and how do i disable it?
20:15:00 <strcat[m]> it's not super important but it does slightly reduce attack surface
20:15:05 <strcat[m]> there is a switch to disable it at the top
20:15:21 <pix5> ok thank i will try
20:17:10 <pix5> done
20:17:21 <pix5> thanks a lott guys!!
20:51:12 <barfly21[m]> Hi I need help with a somewhat particular situation. My hospital got rid of our physical pagers and is now forcing us to use a proprietary app called SPOK. I can download it through aurora store, but I can only receive my pages by manually refreshing the  feed (looks like it needs google play services)
20:51:53 <barfly21[m]> one maybe useful fact is that they also send us pages to our email, but i am not sure how to make a special notification
21:47:11 <liptoner[m]> Does Graphene OS work with Chromecast?
21:47:40 <strcat[m]> liptoner: yes but it's not built-in to the OS, you can use it via VLC, etc.
21:48:06 <strcat[m]> can't mirror your screen to it
21:48:08 <strcat[m]> can stream stuff to it
21:55:37 <barfly21[m]> ok i figured how to do it
21:56:02 <barfly21[m]> http://davmail.sourceforge.net/advanced.html set IDLE folder monitory delay to 1
21:56:48 <barfly21[m]> create a rule in outlook to move to a specifial folder, create a channel on fairmail for that folder, change the default notification for that channel on fairmail
22:21:13 <eleberum[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> eleberum: make sure that"> I of course gave location permission and other permissions to Osmand and Waze and had location services turned on. It doesn't work.
22:22:34 <eleberum[m]> Anyone else have this problem?
22:25:44 <eleberum[m]> How do you guys get directions for driving? With Osmand, if so, how? Or do you guys use another app?
22:26:09 <barfly21[m]> I gave magic earth a shot, but i use osmand only now
22:26:26 <eleberum[m]> <barfly21[m] "I gave magic earth a shot, but i"> How did you make Osmand work?
22:26:44 <barfly21[m]> worked out of box for me in terms of location/gps
22:27:17 <eleberum[m]> Everytime I try to get my location it says "Position not yet known".
22:28:10 <barfly21[m]> make sure you are outdoors
22:29:22 <barfly21[m]> location on graphene works differently, since it doesn't use google location services
22:31:03 <mintsauce[m]> anupritaisno1: strcat thanks for help earlier. Second installation ran perfectly. Pixel 5is pretty neat but way neater with graphene :)
22:33:11 <eleberum[m]> <barfly21[m] "make sure you are outdoors"> I have tried it outside and it doesn't work. I live in the city of a third world country. Does that affect anything?
22:34:18 <eleberum[m]> Like does location services work better in the US or it shouldn't matter where in the world your are.
22:34:42 <barfly21[m]> not sure, i figured it was reliant on clear line of sight to GPS satellites, but maybe someone else can weigh in
22:35:40 <strcat[m]> eleberum: please try SatStat
22:35:43 <strcat[m]> so you can see what's happening
22:36:06 <strcat[m]> make sure you're using a build of OSMAnd that works properly without Play, maybe their Play Store one doesn't
22:36:30 <strcat[m]> eleberum: it will *often* work inside if you're just in a wooden house on top floor, etc.
22:36:39 <strcat[m]> no metal roof, etc.
22:41:57 <Cliff[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It works as a webapp"> Have you tried maps through browser does it work well?
23:08:33 <sklv1> does grapheneOS support automatic wipe after a certain number of failed attempts at decrypting FDE, or just exponential backoff?
23:10:50 <TheJollyRoger> sklv1: Exponential backoff; it would take roughly 650 years to completely exhaust the available keying space of a 4-digit numeric pincode. Wipe on certain number of failed attempts was only done back in the day due to the limitation of devices not having proper secure enclaves back in 2015.
23:12:24 <TheJollyRoger> Back then, those enclaves had no means to tell time internally. This has changed with the addition of the Titan M which contains its own internal counter and clock integrated within the secure chip.
23:12:29 <sklv1> that's unfortunate. the option to have automatic wipe would be a nice defence in depth against a hardware vulnerability in e.g. the timer
23:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't work that way.
23:13:30 <TheJollyRoger> If that is in your threat model, use a passphrase. GrapheneOS allows passphrases of up to 64 characters in length.
23:14:24 <TheJollyRoger> Nuke on incorrect guesses at pincode will likely never be implemented because it presents a very attractive target for attacking via denial-of-service.
23:15:02 <TheJollyRoger> Again, if you want your data on your phone to remain safe in the event the security chip has a flaw that allows extraction of the access tokens in it, use a passphrase.
23:15:17 <TheJollyRoger> That's why GrapheneOS allows 64 characters to be used, up from 16 from the factory operating system.
23:15:20 <sklv1> It should certainly be opt-in, and it's not obvious to me whether titan M supports such a thing
23:15:46 <sklv1> a long passphrase is a reasonable proposition
23:17:30 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't work the way you think it works; asking the Titan to erase its access tokens on a certain number of wipes, with the expectation that that's a mitigation against the counter being exploited and bypass is a crapshoot because it depends on the same element.
23:18:09 <TheJollyRoger> It offers nothing, aside from theatrics.
23:18:28 <TheJollyRoger> The reason this was done in the past was, again, because chips back then didn't have their own clocks and had to rely on the host clock.
23:19:29 <strcat[m]> sklv1: there isn't hardware support for it, it's supported by AOSP but isn't really useful
23:19:55 <strcat[m]> since the hardware throttling is a much harder target than exploiting the OS
23:20:56 <strcat[m]> so, sure, GrapheneOS supports a hard limit, but it's not a useful feature since even with only a random 6 digit PIN the throttling is enough and that's much harder to bypass than some OS state
23:21:21 <strcat[m]> if you don't want to rely on the secure element, you need a strong passphrase
23:21:48 <sklv1> i see you can't "wipe" the device by overwriting the equivalent of the luks header because there isn't one
23:22:02 <sklv1> does the android API at least support wiping the device?
23:22:14 <strcat[m]> what do you mean? you can wipe the device
23:22:21 <strcat[m]> please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:22:25 <TheJollyRoger> sklv1: So, with respect to that, please take a close look here : https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:22:50 <TheJollyRoger> I quote: "A unique key is derived using HKDF-SHA512 for each regular file, directory and symbolic link from the per-profile encryption keys, or the global encryption key for non-sensitive data stored outside of profiles. The directory key is used to encrypt the file names. GrapheneOS increases the file name padding from 16 bytes to 32 bytes. AES-256-XTS with the global encryption key is also
23:22:52 <strcat[m]> sklv1: also 'wiping the luks header' does not reliably wipe data
23:22:52 <TheJollyRoger> used to encrypt filesystem metadata as a whole beyond the finer-grained file name encryption."
23:22:52 <sklv1> i read it prior to coming here
23:23:04 <strcat[m]> sklv1: and it's *untrue* that you cannot wipe the equivalent, but it is not what provides reliable deletion
23:23:12 <strcat[m]> you cannot reliably delete data from an HDD / SSD
23:23:17 <strcat[m]> via wiping it
23:23:57 <strcat[m]> it's not how the storage works, if you ask to write zeroes over something it will fairly often decide to write them elsewhere
23:24:26 <sklv1> yes, it's nontrivial, I know it can do copy on write, and flash memory has many nuances, and HDDs have the threat of firmware
23:24:40 <strcat[m]> sklv1: it's not nontrivial but rather nonworkable
23:24:43 <strcat[m]> drives don't work that way
23:24:48 <strcat[m]> there is reliable deletion
23:25:00 <strcat[m]> it's not provided by zeroing data on the SSD storage
23:25:11 <TheJollyRoger> Plus, given the way SSDs work, to save wear on the memory, chances are if you ask the SSD to record five megabytes worth of zeroes, it might just record one zero, and then say "repeat this five megabytes' worth of times."
23:25:24 <TheJollyRoger> Then report five megabytes being in use.
23:25:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> *throws SSD into fire*
23:25:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah that'll wipe it
23:25:54 <rny> microwave it :P
23:26:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't need to write any data it can have the concept of zero in metadata or reuse the same zero block just like the Linux kernel does with special zero page
23:26:05 <sklv1> I'd personally use random data, but yes, there are many nuances to SSDs
23:26:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just forget the decryption key tbh
23:26:14 <strcat[m]> sklv1: HDDs too
23:26:56 <rny> isnt there a direct write flag oflag=direct or something
23:26:58 <rny> with dd
23:27:06 <rny> doesnt that write directly to the disk?
23:27:07 <strcat[m]> rny: that bypasses kernel page cache
23:27:15 <strcat[m]> rny: it avoids kernel page cache
23:27:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Cost of wiping SSD: $20-1000
23:27:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Cost of forgetting the decryption key: 0
23:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> Weren't open channel SSDs abandoned?
23:27:49 <rny> do disk controllers do unexpected things in between sync flushes?
23:28:06 <sklv1> wait, 'it's *untrue* that you cannot wipe the equivalent' - so I could build my own copy of grapheneOS that does wipe on X failed attempts, in theory
23:28:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Reminder that most SSDs themselves are SEDs
23:28:27 <strcat[m]> sklv1: GrapheneOS already supports wiping after N attempts as I said above
23:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> sklv1: I would welcome you to do it, but I'm going to caution you that there will be no hardware support for it.
23:28:33 <strcat[m]> sklv1: it is *not useful* because it's enforced by the OS
23:28:34 <strcat[m]> not hardware
23:28:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can ask them to destroy the key
23:28:47 <strcat[m]> sklv1: the hardware throttling makes it pointless
23:28:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> It would be done in hardware
23:28:51 <TheJollyRoger> So you aren't getting anything except a bit of theatrics.
23:28:58 <strcat[m]> sklv1: the timer for the throttling is not implemented in the OS
23:29:01 <strcat[m]> it's in the secure element
23:29:11 <strcat[m]> and unlike stuff in the OS is resistant to tampering
23:29:21 <strcat[m]> the application processor (the CPU) is NOT resistant to physical tampering
23:29:51 <strcat[m]> it's just meant to be fast and useful not secure against tampering beyond the difficulty of doing that kind of thing in general
23:29:54 <strcat[m]> unlike the secure element
23:31:40 <strcat[m]> sklv1: where are you going to store the state for the OS timer? an attacker, without any exploit, can keep restoring the same content to storage between boots, etc.
23:31:58 <strcat[m]> sklv1: the attempt limit in the OS is genuinely not really useful
23:32:13 <strcat[m]> yes, it's supported, but it sucks, so it's not exposed via the Settings app (it's still usable)
23:33:11 <strcat[m]> the hardware enforced rate limit quickly gets to 1 attempt / day and you need millions of dollars to potentially bypass it not just a $200 hack
23:33:23 <strcat[m]> the attempt limit in the OS exists only because enterprise deployments wanted it for their device managers
23:33:30 <strcat[m]> and it exists in a portable way
23:33:32 <sklv1> there's definitely an element of theatrics, or security by obscurity, but devices like greykey for iphone are designed to work in a narrow set of circumstances, i don't think it takes a lot to trip up something like that
23:33:33 <strcat[m]> not specific to hardware
23:33:53 <strcat[m]> sklv1: there's really no point of the OS attempt limit
23:34:09 <strcat[m]> an exploit of the firmware/OS bypasses it, restoring NAND bypasses it, etc.
23:34:13 <strcat[m]> you do not need an exploit to bypass it
23:34:32 <strcat[m]> the hardware throttling is actually very useful for the vast majority of users without a strong passphrase
23:34:52 <sklv1> absolutely, far be it from me to dispute that
23:35:11 <strcat[m]> sklv1: a hardware limit on # of attempts would be useful but that is implemented as 1 attempt / day rather a hard limit
23:35:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically just log into whatever until you hit the password limit and then set time ahead by 1 day in the motherboard, then keep hacking at the password
23:35:16 <strcat[m]> it could do both, but doesn't, at least right now
23:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to devices like Graykey, those are usually just frontends for nontechnical users to be able to run prepackaged exploits, or a guided way to run ADB and enumerate files or remove files from a device you already have the password to, or run prepackaged or "canned" exploits on a phone you already have.
23:35:27 <strcat[m]> sklv1: their focus was security by default for users without a strong passphrase
23:35:35 <TheJollyRoger> They're far from the "miracle devices" that they often posit themselves to be.
23:35:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> The OS has ntp/time sync? Just disconnect the internet
23:36:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's how useless OS limits are
23:36:27 <sklv1> TheJollyRoger: I definitely agree, i suspect they used some timing + glitching attack, to unreliably bypass the timer limit. I'm not under the impression it's a panacea
23:36:51 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't trust the security chip, the correct mitigation is to use a long passphrase. Using secondary profiles is optional, but recommended if you are diligent at hitting that "End Session" key when you no longer need the profile active.
23:37:02 <strcat[m]> it's a secure element so it's secured against tampering, unlike the application processor
23:37:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> sklv1: then you just set a long password?
23:37:03 <TheJollyRoger> Mhmm
23:37:11 <strcat[m]> it's not invincible but it's very hard to bypass
23:37:28 <strcat[m]> you think that persistent state would be harder to bypass but it isn't a fact
23:37:36 <sklv1> that's my intention, but I feel it leaves me with a weaker security model than the iphone which I want to stop using, which implements a attempt limit in hardware
23:37:37 <strcat[m]> and it is not implemented
23:37:40 <strcat[m]> so it's not on the table
23:37:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Basically just log into whatever"> Btw TheJollyRoger I actually did this on my workstation
23:37:47 <strcat[m]> sklv1: it has a stronger security model than the iPhone
23:37:47 <sklv1> (well, I'm assuming it's in hardware, let me check)
23:37:48 <rny> liquid nitrogen to freeze ram to preserve state -- timer frozen
23:37:54 <rny> https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1162
23:38:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I was kinda tired and linux locked me out because I entered the wrong password
23:38:07 <strcat[m]> rny: the secure element timer isn't like that
23:38:11 <rny> if you have that kinda threat model, just dont use a phone :P
23:38:15 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Aha! fancy that XD
23:38:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk why arch has a lockout by default
23:38:22 <strcat[m]> rny: you can't bypass the secure element timer through stuff like that
23:38:36 <strcat[m]> it's not invincible but the obvious attacks do not work
23:38:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Set the motherboard time ahead by 15 minutes and I got in
23:38:58 <strcat[m]> rny: if you freeze the Titan M your data is gone
23:39:05 <rny> strcat[m]: TIL.
23:39:13 <strcat[m]> it may still work
23:39:15 <strcat[m]> but your data is gone
23:39:20 <rny> strcat[m]: how does the electronics work that enables that
23:39:34 <strcat[m]> rny: it's set up with layers of anti-tampering stuff temperature included
23:39:43 <TheJollyRoger> I think it has its own onboard temperature and voltage sensor.
23:39:44 <strcat[m]> it's 'tamper evident' as in it fucks over your data if you mess with it
23:39:54 <strcat[m]> so for example there are circuits on it where it measures resistance of them, etc.
23:40:08 <rny> a bogey trip wire, nice.
23:40:16 <strcat[m]> look at pictures of secure elements disassembled
23:40:41 <strcat[m]> even very basic ones have stuff like long, really tiny mazes of paths on them where they measure resistance
23:40:59 <sklv1> here's a nice defcon vid about attacking TPMs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-hohCfo4LA
23:41:04 <strcat[m]> if you short circuit it, break it, change resistance too much (temperature, tampering with it, etc.) it gets wrong value
23:41:13 <rny> does that also mean i shouldnt bring my pixel to antartica if i plan to visit?
23:41:14 <rny> :P
23:41:26 <strcat[m]> sklv1: the model for the Titan M with Weaver is significantly stronger than what the iPhone does
23:41:27 <rny> you just cant win, can you.
23:41:41 <TheJollyRoger> rny: We're fine up here in the frozen north. I just put my phone in my pants pocket, rather than in the outer pocket of my parka.
23:41:48 <strcat[m]> sklv1: the Titan M has a 1 million USD bounty so if you really think it can be broken for < $25k I suggest getting that easy money
23:41:57 <strcat[m]> clearly, it can't be invincible
23:41:59 <strcat[m]> it can be compromised
23:42:20 <strcat[m]> because the model is physical access + tampering
23:42:25 <strcat[m]> but that doesn't mean it can or will be done in practice
23:43:48 <sklv1> That's fair. At the more extreme ends of the threat model spectrum you can always destroy the phone yourself if you care enough. It's not unreasonable.
23:44:01 <strcat[m]> sklv1: this has little to do with wiping
23:44:04 <strcat[m]> wiping data is reliable
23:44:17 <strcat[m]> you cannot exploit the Titan M to get back deleted data
23:44:20 <strcat[m]> I wasn't talking about that
23:44:42 <strcat[m]> if you delete a profile, the material needed to derive that key is gone
23:44:57 <strcat[m]> the only way it could not be gone is if as part of doing that you literally brick the device
23:45:03 <strcat[m]> and you'll know you bricked it...
23:45:21 <strcat[m]>  * the only realistic way it could not be gone is if as part of doing that you literally brick the device
23:45:36 <strcat[m]> i.e. it is possible that the secure storage in the Titan M fails... which bricks your phone
23:45:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw iirc mkfs.f2fs does a blksecdiscard call anyway
23:46:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> For those who are paranoid
23:46:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: doesn't provide reliable data deletion
23:46:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Aware
23:46:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Best way is to just tell the titan M to forget the keys
23:46:58 <strcat[m]> sklv1: if you delete a profile, the stuff to derive that key is gone, if you do a factory reset same for data as a whole
23:47:26 <strcat[m]> sklv1: the brute force prevention is a different thing
23:48:31 <strcat[m]> key derivation is expensive (helps with a passphrase), part of it is hardware-bound (SoC feature, helps with a non-strong passphrase that's not strong enough vs. a server farm brute force) and then there's the secure element throttling via Weaver
23:49:45 <strcat[m]> the way the secure element is integrated, it's a bonus thing, and you need the random token from it to derive the key for that profile
23:50:14 <deadlydata[m]> **(gets his logic analyser out)
23:50:15 <strcat[m]> in addition to needing the passphrase, that's why it's a bonus thing
23:50:50 <strcat[m]> the secure element receives a personalized hash of the key derived with scrypt, like other uses of that key
23:51:14 <strcat[m]> then the random token is incorporated with that and used for the main key derivation via SoC hardware accelerated / hardware bound key derivation
23:51:46 <sklv1> strcat[m]: "the model for the Titan M with Weaver is significantly stronger than what the iPhone does" - what are the differences? I am researching now
23:55:29 <strcat[m]> sklv1: it has 1 little job and relies on it holding random tokens, and you can't update the firmware of it (even with the signing key) until you authenticate as the owner account
23:56:21 <strcat[m]> sklv1: so, pretend you infiltrate Google and manage to get physical access to the HSM and whatever secrets you need to sign some evil firmware, okay, you have your evil firmware
23:56:24 <strcat[m]> say you exploit the OS on a phone
23:56:34 <strcat[m]> you cannot actually update the Titan M with that valid signed evil firmware
23:56:38 <strcat[m]> from the exploited OS
23:56:46 <strcat[m]> you need to authenticate as the owner 1st
23:57:14 <sklv1> whereas apple can update the secure enclave firmware without authenticating?
23:57:22 <strcat[m]> so it only helps you bypass the throttling for a secondary profile once you already have owner profile pass
23:57:28 <strcat[m]> sklv1: that's how it was in the past, at least
23:57:59 <strcat[m]> sklv1: Pixels got this feature with Pixel 2 (before Titan M)
23:58:03 <strcat[m]> called Inside Attack Protection
23:58:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> *insider
23:58:59 <strcat[m]>  * called Insider Attack Protection
23:59:00 <strcat[m]> typo
