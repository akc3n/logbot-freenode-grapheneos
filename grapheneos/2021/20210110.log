05:44:53 <yesman> I got Graphene OS installed and now I'm trying to install F-Droid. I downloaded and verified the .apk files on my linux system  and now I would like to transfer the file to my phone. How can I accomplish this?
05:46:56 <deappledapple> Flash drives with otg, or use the usb cables
05:47:25 <deappledapple> Then there'll be something on notifications to change from no data transfer to MTP (?)
05:48:53 <yesman> I have the phone connected via usb currently. I didn't receive any notifications when I connected the phone
05:51:14 <louipc> adb install
05:54:08 <deappledapple> <louipc "adb install"> Don't really need adb
05:54:26 <deappledapple> Just transfer the files to the phone, and install it on the files app
05:55:03 <deappledapple> That trusts less on desktop OS which is less secure than GrapheneOS
05:56:31 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah.
05:56:58 <take_a_deep_brea> dontknow, feel more queasy when i use adb with graphene
06:40:36 * stencil[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NjcqupYVKIBAQwHiqnKJhSdT/message.txt >
07:28:26 <strcat[m]> added a sentence to the encryption section of the FAQ clarifying that invalid input (above / below supported length) doesn't trigger an attempt at authentication and key derivation
07:28:29 <strcat[m]> just gets rejected by the UI
07:28:41 <strcat[m]> due to the unnecessary panic over that earlier
08:25:10 <take_a_deep_brea> whats the max supported length ?

09:11:07 <mishmasher[m]> Hi I was wondering if you lock your phone is it encrypted? Or do you really have to power it off?
09:12:56 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "Hi I was wondering if you lock y"> Have to restart to restore to before first unlock for all users. For secondary users, logout or "end session" flushes the encryption key for that user
09:13:14 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "Hi I was wondering if you lock y"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
09:13:50 <deappledapple> From "Sensitive data is stored..." paragrap
09:24:03 <mishmasher[m]> So basically the more secure way to do things is make another profile and use that for your sensitive data?
09:24:21 <mishmasher[m]> And that data is encrypted when you end session?
09:25:05 <deappledapple> Yeah, as said there
09:33:47 <mishmasher[m]> All right and if you delete user with said sensitive data, how hard would it be to retrieve that data with forensic software? Since encryption key should be deleted too right?
09:37:51 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "All right and if you delete user"> No encryption keys, no data decryption
09:38:59 <take_a_deep_brea> mishmasher:  youre better  of reading this https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
09:39:33 <mishmasher[m]> <deappledapple "No encryption keys, no data decr"> Meaning the data isn't protected and retrieve-able?
09:40:13 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "Meaning the data isn't protected"> As in they can't really do anything even if they recovered the data, they can't decrypt it iirc
09:41:05 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "Meaning the data isn't protected"> Read the Weaver token paragraph for relevant details
09:42:33 <mishmasher[m]> <deappledapple "As in they can't really do anyth"> Oh shi, I read "No encryption keys, no data ENCRYPTION" my bad. Lol.
09:42:50 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: please read the info available in the usage guide and FAQ 1st
09:42:51 <mishmasher[m]> Haven't had my coffee yet
09:43:00 <mishmasher[m]> Thank you
09:43:56 <mishmasher[m]> <strcat[m] "Thatcher: please read the info a"> I have read it just asking here to see if I got it correctly
09:46:19 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: it's about the limit of the UI, not the device manager one
09:46:29 <strcat[m]> the UI rejects overly short / long inputs
09:47:04 <strcat[m]> if you enter 2 characters and press enter, it knows that can't be an actual attempt at unlocking, since that's never allowed
09:47:15 <strcat[m]> it's straightforward
09:48:19 <strcat[m]> it simply doesn't attempt to authenticate with invalid input, it gets rejected as invalid input
09:48:44 <strcat[m]> I'm trying to use generic phrasing that applies to all lock methods
09:48:48 <strcat[m]> since it's true for all
09:49:14 <strcat[m]> if you press enter with empty / overly short input, it's just invalid use of the UI, it's not an actual unlock attempt
09:49:29 <strcat[m]> doesn't actually try to authenticate/decrypt
09:49:37 <strcat[m]>  * doesn't actually try to authenticate and derive keys
09:49:55 <strcat[m]> also perhaps I need to make the last paragraph talking about the keystore more prominent since people seem to miss that
09:50:07 <strcat[m]> it's a bit frustrating having documentation misinterpreted and people panicking about silly things
09:54:35 <take_a_deep_brea> i get it. thanks for that clarification.and also ...we seem to have become an alt-right group using a pro Truml OS briefly.... dont see how that would work.

10:20:28 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry.
10:21:02 <take_a_deep_brea> i didnt mean to discuss politics .
10:25:52 <take_a_deep_brea> will be more aware next time .
10:32:18 <olu61> Glad to join this channel
10:32:31 <deappledapple> Welcome ^^
10:34:38 <olu61> Thanks !
10:40:01 <olu61> I need some help. I'm trying to install grapheneos on my pixel 3a but it sticks at "Rebooting into fastboot"
10:40:28 <strcat> sticks?
10:41:50 <olu61> the installation is stuck, I mean
10:42:07 <olu61> Sorry English is not my first language ^^
11:38:21 <stencil[m]> OT: What's the suggested browser by daniel, Is there any verified boot laptop?
11:41:48 <Golli[m]1> Vanadium and Bromite are the only 2 browsers officially recommended.
11:42:06 <stencil[m]> *desktop
11:42:18 <Golli[m]1> And currently there's no verified boot laptop, unless you look at something like the Librem line. But this is off topic.
11:42:56 <stencil[m]> Also is there a OT grapheneos channel?
11:43:31 <strcat> Golli[m]1: Librem is anti-security and the opposite of having verified boot
11:43:36 <strcat> there ARE laptops with verified boot
11:43:45 <strcat> you've repeatedly been told that afaik
11:44:08 <strcat> Golli[m]1: a laptop that goes out of the way to break low-level security and prevent security updates is not helpful
11:44:28 <strcat> and yes, it's off-topic, but spreading harmful misinformation here is problematic beyond that
11:45:07 <strcat> and especially since they asked for what my recommendation would be that makes it even more problematic for you to use it as an opportunity to promote something that I've stated on many occasionals that I consider a scam due to repeated dishonest marketing and claims
11:46:07 <strcat> stencil[m]: m1 macbook has strong hardware security measures and a form of verified boot, which like Pixels is usable by another OS
11:46:30 <strcat> in the future ask in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
11:46:42 <strcat> #grapheneos-offtopic on freenode (can see you're on matrix though)
11:46:45 <stencil[m]> Thanks strcat!
12:06:36 * AppAraat[m] starts speaking in Bernie Sanders voice
12:06:42 <AppAraat[m]> I Am Once Again Asking for Your Support!
12:06:50 <AppAraat[m]> What is the best method to transfer app config (and data) from my old phone (Pixel 2) to a new one (Pixel 3a) ?
12:07:10 <AppAraat[m]> (It kinda saddens me that on my desktop system I can just git clone my dotfile repo and be done with it. AFAIK to this day on AOSP you have to jump through massive hoops. Unless there's a new method I'm unaware of.)
12:08:05 <take_a_deep_brea> AppAraat: you can use termux app
12:08:09 <stencil[m]> Isn'n there an included app?
12:09:00 <AppAraat[m]> strcat: also, thank you _so_ much for bringing the latest update to the Pixel 2, I didn't have time yet to upgrade to a supported one but hopefully I can do that the following day(s).
12:09:24 <AppAraat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: oh? How can Termux have access to app data of other apps?
12:09:48 <AppAraat[m]>  * strcat: also, thank you _so_ much for bringing the latest update to the Pixel 2, I didn't have time yet to upgrade to a supported phone but hopefully I can do that the following day(s).
12:10:01 <take_a_deep_brea> nevermind my suggestion
12:10:10 <stencil[m]> GrapheneOS includes Seedvault as an OS backup service which must be explicitly enabled, and it has the option to automatically restore app data when an app is reinstalled, so it wouldn't lose track of it being the same profile.
12:10:11 <take_a_deep_brea> stupid.
12:10:31 <take_a_deep_brea> <take_a_deep_brea "nevermind my suggestion"> stupid.

12:22:58 <cereal_eater[m]> Is there a way to remove exif data from photos without an app on grapheneos?
12:28:54 <AppAraat[m]> cereal_eater: I guess technically an app, but you can install `exiftool` in Termux and then point it towards your camera dir.
12:29:52 <cereal_eater[m]> <AppAraat[m] "cereal_eater: I guess technicall"> Thanks, will try that.
12:38:59 <stencil[m]> <AppAraat[m] "stencil: Under Settings > System"> Remember to actually backup to desktop or external something. No syncing between phone here(yet)
12:39:25 <AppAraat[m]> thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
12:49:27 <olu61> I'm once again asking for your support. Installing grapheneos on my pixel 3a phone and running ./flash-all.sh is stuck at fastbootd screen
12:49:37 <olu61> thanks for the support
12:52:02 <olu61> ...
12:52:14 <olu61> archive does not contain 'vbmeta_system.img'
12:52:23 <olu61> archive does not contain 'vendor_boot.img'
12:52:37 <olu61> extracting super_empty.img (0 MB) to disk... took 0.000s
12:52:47 <olu61> Rebooting into fastboot                            OKAY [  0.060s]
12:53:40 <olu61> Sorry, I don't know how to format the outcome here
12:57:57 <fll[m]> olu61: the flash-all script can't find the images it is supposed to flash onto the phone.
12:59:21 <olu61> @fll[]
12:59:24 <fll[m]> Either you didn't download the correct image or you are executing the script inside of the wrong folder....is what I can think of of the top of my head...
13:00:31 <olu61> I downloaded the image from https://grapheneos.org/releases
13:01:21 <fll[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip this is for 3a
13:02:09 <olu61> yes. and all the images are in the same folder, I moved them to the standalone platform-tools folder
13:03:09 <fll[m]> And you're not supposed to unzip the image...just in case ;)
13:04:58 <olu61> I only unzipped the factory image I downloaded
13:05:12 <JerrynDev[m]> <fll[m] "And you're not supposed to unzip"> So yo have to put the unzipped image into the platform tools folder?
13:05:38 <pacman37[m]> I don't think librem has verified boot. Also, it's not recommended here
13:07:35 <fll[m]> <olu61 "I only unzipped the factory imag"> Don't
13:10:05 <JerrynDev[m]> <JerrynDev[m] "So yo have to put the unzipped i"> And only unzip the platform-tools?
13:10:18 <olu61> ok but in this https://grapheneos.org/install it is recommended to extract the factory images and then move into the directory to run ./flash-all
13:10:32 <olu61> I am confuzed !!!
13:10:42 <olu61> X)
13:12:21 <fll[m]> Oh, it is! My bad!
13:12:41 <fll[m]> My memory failed me
13:18:41 <olu61> How can I past the outcome here in a code format ?
13:19:11 <olu61> Is it possible in this platform ?
13:20:50 <fll[m]> olu61: are you doing this on a Debian/Ubuntu derivate?
13:21:11 <olu61> No, on mac M1
13:21:30 <olu61> Maybe I should switch to macOS Catalina
13:21:46 <olu61> I am gonna give it a try and I will let you now
13:21:52 <olu61> Thanks
13:24:08 <fll[m]> I've no experience with Mac. Does fastboot devices show your phone?
13:25:21 <olu61> Yes it does (actually ./fastboot devices does)
13:27:32 <fll[m]> Just trying to cover the most common problems now:
13:27:32 <fll[m]> Phone-computer connection faulty (either through udev rules or bad USB cable or USB controller driver) or computer using the wrong (old) fastboot
13:29:01 <take_a_deep_brea> <olu61 "archive does not contain 'vendor"> olu61:  the part you pasted here is not of significance
13:29:20 <take_a_deep_brea> it also occurs in my case
13:30:13 <take_a_deep_brea> i am talking of the part of the terminal output you  pasted here in the beginning
13:30:35 <olu61> it's actually "vendor_boot.img"
13:30:53 <olu61> Yes it's the outcome ./flash-all.sh
13:32:24 <olu61> it's part of the outcome of ./flash-all.sh
13:32:58 <take_a_deep_brea> that part is fine.it does not matter.
13:34:25 <take_a_deep_brea> in case you had some error further down in the terminal output , you got to look there
13:34:49 <olu61> ok. Well ! the next outcome is : extracting super_empty.img (0 MB) to disk... took 0.000s
13:35:02 <olu61> then : Rebooting into fastboot                            OKAY [  0.060s]

17:10:36 <elmo_outlaw[m]> scratch that its ./fastboot
17:11:39 <strcat[m]> you're not following the official guile
17:11:44 <strcat[m]>  * you're not following the official guide
17:12:19 <strcat[m]> elmo_outlaw: delete what you downloaded
17:12:30 <strcat[m]> elmo_outlaw: follow https://grapheneos.org/install from top to bottom, and don't deviate from the instructions there
17:12:40 <strcat[m]> you definitely did your own thing or followed an unofficial guide if you're in the platform-tools directory
17:12:51 <strcat[m]> run only the commands given there
17:13:00 <strcat[m]> don't download it and extract it your own way
17:13:39 <strcat[m]> and don't try to work around not setting PATH as explained there by changing directories
17:15:05 <elmo_outlaw[m]> <strcat[m] "elmo_outlaw: follow https://grap"> ill start from scratch
17:15:22 <strcat[m]> make sure to download / extract it as it says and set PATH
17:15:44 <strcat[m]> and it has you check that `fastboot --version` is correct before flashing
17:18:43 <elmo_outlaw[m]> done matey thanks, my bootloader is already unlocked so i am good to go to flash-all when i reach that point?
17:20:28 <louipcm> yes
17:20:57 <randomusertester> Is it possible to use a navigation app on GrapheneOS?
17:21:11 <strcat> elmo_outlaw[m]: yes need to make sure fastboot --version gives right results at that point (after getting platform-tools set up)
17:21:20 <strcat> elmo_outlaw[m]: and then as long as you have a reliable USB connection it will work
17:21:26 <strcat> and then you just lock the bootloader and you're done
17:22:23 <elmo_outlaw[m]> <strcat "elmo_outlaw: and then as long as"> all good so far just downloading the image now
17:23:53 <louipcm> randomusertester:  i believe there are several ones that work to various degrees
17:24:47 <louipcm> randomusertester:  please join #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for chat about 3rd party apps
17:25:20 <jungle_surfer[m]> randomusertester: magic earth work really gold in grapheneos
17:25:37 <strcat> randomusertester: GPS and TTS both work well - you need a TTS app
17:25:43 <strcat> so yes works fine
17:25:50 <strcat> TTS -> text to speech
17:26:10 <strcat> and yes offtopic is better for discussing which apps are based
17:26:18 <strcat> are best*
17:26:27 <strcat> guess that typo works too if I was 13
17:27:09 <elmo_outlaw[m]> shall i choose reboot to bootloader on phone in order to lock it
17:29:09 <elmo_outlaw[m]> You guys are stars, if we ever meet your officially allowed to slap me once
17:29:16 <elmo_outlaw[m]> Thank YOU
17:31:10 <take_a_deep_brea> <elmo_outlaw[m] "shall i choose reboot to bootloa"> if you havent locked bootloader yet please type
17:31:23 * elmo_outlaw[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/csBfnJwXjkHMiHBIokDDmYAi/message.txt >
17:31:40 <elmo_outlaw[m]> i swear im not usually this rarted 🤣
17:31:49 <take_a_deep_brea> great! welcome to grapheneOS!
17:32:22 <take_a_deep_brea> <elmo_outlaw[m] "i swear im not usually this rart"> no problem , i too got never during my first flash.
17:32:38 <take_a_deep_brea> * no problem , i too got nervous during my first flash.
17:33:17 <elmo_outlaw[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "no problem , i too got never dur"> Thanks man glad to be here
17:36:42 <louipcm> did you take_a_deep_breath
17:53:27 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah kinda .
18:31:34 <OTGnoob> Hello, I am trying to install graphene OS on a pixel 4a and am having trouble with the flashing process. Does anyone have a minute to lend a hand?
18:33:50 <louipc> best to just ask questions directly
18:34:37 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris\sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03> ./flash-all.bat
18:34:37 <OTGnoob> fastboot not found; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and add it to the shell PATH
18:35:04 <OTGnoob> platform-tools are downloaded and in my directory
18:35:25 <strcat> did you run the command to set Path *before* you did cd into the sunfish directory?
18:35:29 <mrxx_0[m]> Are you following the official install guide https://grapheneos.org/install ?
18:35:38 <strcat> think you missed the $env:Path step
18:35:43 <OTGnoob> Yes I am following the official install
18:35:53 <strcat> and running fastboot --version to check that it worked before flashing
18:36:05 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris\sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
18:36:09 <OTGnoob> I did that
18:36:47 <louipc> did you verify and extract fastboot
18:36:51 <OTGnoob> and checked the fastboot version but I did have to add the platform-tools/ to get it to run
18:37:26 <louipc> hmm
18:37:33 <strcat[m]> OTGnoob: no
18:37:38 <strcat[m]> OTGnoob: you did it wrong
18:37:45 <OTGnoob> O sorry that string was wrong I tried running it again while in sunfish directory
18:37:51 <strcat[m]> OTGnoob: you were supposed to run that $env:Path command earlier, not when you did it
18:37:56 <OTGnoob> but earlier I ran:
18:38:05 <louipc> you shouldnt change directory
18:38:08 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris> "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
18:38:09 <strcat[m]> OTGnoob: close the terminal, start over (you can skip the downloads)
18:38:26 <strcat[m]> that's not the command it has you run
18:38:30 <OTGnoob> Oh so run the flash while still in users/chris?
18:38:47 <strcat[m]> no
18:38:58 <strcat[m]> the command you were supposed to run is `$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"`
18:39:13 <strcat[m]> you only used the second part which isn't a command by itself
18:39:16 <strcat[m]> it's just a string
18:39:25 <strcat[m]> close PowerShell
18:39:27 <strcat[m]> open it again
18:39:28 <OTGnoob> Yes I did that as well. I followed the install, the earlier copy paste was an attempt at troubleshooting
18:39:43 <OTGnoob> Ok closing
18:39:56 <strcat[m]> open it again, run the path command make sure that `fastboot --version` works properly (seems you skipped this) and continue with flashing
18:40:05 <strcat[m]> as before
18:40:35 <OTGnoob> Ok. one minute
18:43:53 <OTGnoob> ok I think this will work this time.  When I tried running the fastboot check last time around it couldn't find the file unless i prefaced it with platform-tools/fastboot. This time it seems to be working properly
18:44:02 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris> Remove-Item Alias:Curl
18:44:03 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
18:44:03 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris> fastboot --version
18:44:04 <OTGnoob> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
18:44:04 <OTGnoob> Installed as C:\Users\chris\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
18:44:05 <OTGnoob> PS C:\Users\chris>
18:45:59 <OTGnoob> We have lift off. Thanks strcat[m].
18:46:35 <strcat[m]> OTGnoob: the issue was you only ran the full command in another directory
18:46:49 <strcat[m]> and it references platform-tools via $pwd which means current directory
18:47:05 <strcat[m]> so just wait for flashing to finish and run the locking command and it should be good
18:50:09 <OTGnoob> Thanks!
19:04:16 <bentley> it goes without saying that apps can see the list of installed apps. but can they see things that have been added to the home screen, like webpages via vanadium?
20:09:12 <asht> Hey, do you know how and whether I can install the original Google Camera on GrapheneOS?
20:10:10 <asht> I know my friend downloaded some APK from apkmirror and Gcam-Services-Provider but it didn't work
20:19:06 <asht> She explained to me that it does open up, but then it just shows an icon of a camera
20:46:09 <cyberparty> asht: The SELinux domains for Google Camera have been removed for a while, effectively preventing it from working properly.
20:46:50 <asht> okay, is there anything I can do?
20:48:21 <asht> Do you think it's possible for me to patch GrapheneOS and recompile it with the needed rules?
20:50:55 <strcat> cyberparty: they haven't actually been removed yet
20:50:59 <strcat> not the problem
20:51:14 <strcat> the issue is it depends on Play services and they're not using the current version of that workaround app
20:51:20 <strcat> or some issue like that
20:51:32 <strcat> we do plan to remove the SELinux domains just as we removed all the Play services SELinux domains
20:52:00 <strcat> shouldn't break it just prevents it from using the DSP and Visual/Neural Core directly so it'd use software and might lose features
20:53:01 <asht> okay
20:54:50 <asht> Did this Gcam-Service-Provider work in earlier versions of GrapheneOS?
20:59:03 <cyberparty> strcat: Ah, my bad
21:00:54 <asht> Well, thank you @strcat
21:02:09 <asht> I'll see if I can implement some of Google's algorithms in the built in camera, so I could give back something to the community
21:10:30 <wsahkgjhmma[m]> > I'll see if I can implement some of Google's algorithms in the built in camera, so I could give back something to the community
21:10:30 <wsahkgjhmma[m]> That would be amazing. The Pixel camera hardware/software really does take much better photos. If it's all siloed off from network access I don't see the harm in using it.
21:10:30 <wsahkgjhmma[m]> I tried the Gcam services provider app and it's not working for me either. The latest GitHub release is from Oct 26 so I'm guessing an update since then broke it.
21:37:01 <brennev1n[m]> I'm probably gonna buy a Pixel 4XL pretty soon. Does anyone know if Mullvad VPN is working properly on Graphene?
21:37:30 <ghost_matrix[m]> <brennev1n[m] "I'm probably gonna buy a Pixel 4"> Mullvad  works great
21:37:36 <ghost_matrix[m]> I'm on pixel 4a
21:38:41 <ghost_matrix[m]> The always on VPN kill switch works as well
21:39:13 <brennev1n[m]> Sweet :) Thanks! And I suppose Signal won't be a problem as well? Since their app can be directly downloaded from their website.
21:39:20 <ghost_matrix[m]> I have not had any issus running anything on graphene.
21:39:20 <ghost_matrix[m]> I love it
21:40:01 <ghost_matrix[m]> Signal works great!
21:40:01 <ghost_matrix[m]> If you make another profile you will need to choose which profile you use it in mainly
21:42:08 <ghost_matrix[m]> And if you use signal in a user profile and not on main you you need to make messages your default messaging app.
21:42:08 <ghost_matrix[m]> So you can can get push notifications. And regular messages from non signal users
21:42:08 <ghost_matrix[m]> Its just a qwirk when using signal on another user profile
21:42:28 <ghost_matrix[m]> Still use signal of course ;)
21:43:53 <brennev1n[m]> Good to hear! Can't wait. Im having a hard time finding a Pixel 4XL in my country though (does not officially sell here). The prices are ridiculous - some up to $1,1K :/
21:43:55 <ghost_matrix[m]> It's not really an issue more of a qwirk really
21:44:35 <ghost_matrix[m]> Yeah same kinda issue I did pay a bit for for mine as well
21:45:18 <ghost_matrix[m]> But its worth the feeling of security and privacy.... Trust me
21:45:41 <brennev1n[m]> I guess that's the price you pay for better privacy.  I just have to find one :D
21:45:42 <ghost_matrix[m]> Think about how much an iPhone is.....ridiculous
21:46:19 <brennev1n[m]> Hahaha yeah. iPhones are getting really ridiculous.
21:50:04 <seq4923[m]> I wanted to buy a 4a in my country but it's sold out right now. Do you think they will come back?
21:50:04 <seq4923[m]> The 4a for me still seems to have a reasonable price compared to the others.
21:50:59 <brennev1n[m]> Have you tried looking for a used one?
21:52:29 <seq4923[m]> Yes, didn't find a used one either. And the other used model that I found were sometimes almost as high as the new one.
21:52:51 <Kurai> ghost_matrix[m] brennev1n[m]: just don't buy new, I got an 11 pro max 256gb for ~700eur
21:55:26 <ghost_matrix[m]> I would suggest trying to find a 4a as they are priced reasonable
21:55:45 <ghost_matrix[m]> I love my 4a, best phone I've ever had
21:56:08 <ghost_matrix[m]> With graphene of course
22:01:06 <rheaalleen[m]> Got a pixel 4 xl for 369€ best bang  for thw buck and grapheneos works flawless
22:01:58 <brennev1n[m]> <ghost_matrix[m] "I would suggest trying to find a"> You're right about that. Just looled up some used ones and they are about half the price! Why's that? Is the specs that much "worse"?
22:03:04 <ghost_matrix[m]> I'm not tonsure on the specs but my 4a is really good and I can't complain about anything really
22:03:07 <deetot> Seems kinda pricey. Got my 3a for 300 aud
22:03:13 <brennev1n[m]> > <@rheaalleen:matrix.org> Got a pixel 4 xl for 369€ best bang  for thw buck and grapheneos works flawless
22:03:13 <brennev1n[m]> >
22:03:13 <brennev1n[m]> Wow. You got a great deal. 64gb version i presume?
22:03:17 <ghost_matrix[m]> * I'm not to sure on the specs but my 4a is really good and I can't complain about anything really
22:03:22 <rheaalleen[m]> No, these usually have minor scratches
22:03:28 <rheaalleen[m]> <brennev1n[m] "> <@rheaalleen:matrix.org> Got a"> Yes
22:03:38 <seq4923[m]> Another benefit of the 4a is the old-fashioned headphone jack. I like having those.
22:03:56 <ghost_matrix[m]> <seq4923[m] "Another benefit of the 4a is the"> 👆
22:04:34 <rheaalleen[m]> Mine qas said to be pretty rhough, i had to find a magnifying glass to find scratches
22:04:41 <brennev1n[m]> Oh dang. Thats actually a dealbreaker if thats not on the 4XL. I hate the new "trend" with removing those. Like....why???
22:05:05 <rheaalleen[m]> I never used music, so it wasn't a problem
22:05:59 <rheaalleen[m]> And you can get an adapter if you really need to use a cable
22:11:00 <brennev1n[m]> that's too much of a hassle for me lol. The pixel 4a looks great though. Will  definitely look more into that one.
22:19:37 <OTGnoob> asht: Install all microG 'Open Source Google Libraries' components. I added it to my F-droid repository and found all the components. Then go to https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-cstark27/ and download the Gcam app.
22:21:06 <OTGnoob> microG needs to be version 0.2.4-3-g47a61d6 to get the camera port from cstark to work
22:22:01 <seq4923[m]> In which scenarios is there a real difference between gcam and the stock camera?
22:24:50 <OTGnoob> There are features like pan/global photo, time lapse, geo-tagging etc.
22:33:01 <Birdie[m]> With the Testing section on the Build page. The CTS installation and standalone SDK install instructions.
22:33:02 <Birdie[m]> What am I looking at for GB download wise of bandwidth?
22:33:02 <Birdie[m]> I only intended to play around on KVM emulator without actually installing a build on a physical pixel phone...
23:16:44 <stateofdade[m]> Can anyone help with a fastboot issue?  I have the latest version, but when trying to install the latest Graphene, it says my fastboot is out of date.  Is there a way around this?  I can't run the bat file to flash without getting past this point.
23:43:44 <louipcm> are you using powershell?
23:51:11 <stateofdade[m]> I was using cmd in windows.  I'm able to install stock images or even aosp variants without issue
