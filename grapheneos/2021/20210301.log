00:02:49 <fretegi> mr_hebi_san[m], excellent color thank you
00:04:53 <fretegi> man i think i can type better on this JA keyboard than the samsung one....
00:09:35 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, just to clarify regarding aurora.. were talking about the aurora store right? seem there is another called aurora droid, which is an alternative to fdroid?
00:12:26 <bizanon[m]> is there a video tutorial for web install?
00:12:35 <bizanon[m]> i alraedy have an old pixel 2 GOS
00:16:06 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: Unfortunately, I don't recall which it is to look for interprocess communication :(. You're likely ahead of me there, unfortunately.
00:16:15 <fretegi> bizanon[m], perhaps a video, however this is what i followed
00:16:16 <fretegi> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
00:16:34 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: yes. The Aurora store is essentially a mirror for the Play Store.
00:16:57 <bizanon[m]> so do I download the build on my pixel 2 first?
00:17:50 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: A good way to think of apps on GrapheneOS is that since GrapheneOS deliberately elects not to bundle Play Services, every app that relies on Play Software being on your phone is essentially "De-Googled."
00:18:11 <TheJollyRoger> However, if the app authors have not *designed* the app to run without Google, you may experience strange and sometimes weird behaviour.
00:18:17 <fretegi> in looking at it, im not sure it supports a pixel 2..
00:18:20 <bizanon[m]> i remember daniel explaining it was really simple if you have 2 phones to install GOS
00:18:30 <bizanon[m]> with the new web install
00:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: GrapheneOS has ended support for the Pixel 2 and 2XL.
00:18:44 <zzxx123> <bizanon[m] "so do I download the build on my"> how about you read the guide first
00:18:55 <bizanon[m]> I did read it and im still lost
00:18:58 <TheJollyRoger> Those handsets are now end of life. We no longer support them. The images on GrapheneOS.org are there for archival and historical preservation purposes only.
00:19:16 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, oh fantatic, any word on whether google maps is one of those that work?  im not using it... BUT... will get asked ha
00:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 2 and 2XL are now obsolete, the SOCs have been abandoned by their vendors, and they are both now insecure *regardless* of the operating system you install on them.
00:19:58 <bizanon[m]> gotcha im just saying I have one laying around. Thought I could web install using it
00:19:59 <TheJollyRoger> Our recommendation for any people stranded on Pixel 2XLs or Pixel 2s is to recycle those handsets and trade for a Pixel 4a, 4a5G, or a 5G.
00:20:15 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: I don't think the web installer supports the old devices anymore.
00:20:18 <bizanon[m]> web install using pixel 2 to install GOS on my pixel 5
00:20:52 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Switch the Pixel 5 off.
00:21:04 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Hold down VOLUME DOWN and POWER until the Pixel 5 starts in fastboot mode.
00:21:15 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: plug the 5 into the phone doing the installation.
00:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: visit https://grapheneos.org/install/web on the phone doing the installation.
00:22:07 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: I don't know if Google Maps will work, it may be dependent on Play Services.
00:22:31 <bizanon[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you that was clear
00:22:41 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: So, with respect to apps and strange behaviour, this is what generally happens if you install an app dependent on GSF to GrapheneOS:
00:22:43 <bizanon[m]> do I need to unlock bootloader like it says on the website?
00:23:02 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: please follow the instructions in order. It explains everything there.
00:23:17 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Google maps amazingly enough does function
00:23:44 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: The first possibility, is that the app will open, then display a warning saying "Google Play Services is missing or disabled from your phone! This app can't run!" and exit.
00:24:11 <TheJollyRoger> The second possibility, is that the app will open and run, but when asked to connect, it may suddenly crash.
00:24:26 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It has limited ability to triangulate you compared to a stock phone though, unless there is some way to allow the app to access all your surrounding WiFi, but it's not clear to me if it can send this data home without gps
00:24:41 <mr_hebi_san[m]> by gps I mean google play services... not gps satelite
00:24:47 <TheJollyRoger> These two possibilities generally happen if the app has been hard-coded by their authors to be specifically dependent on Google and have no fallabkc for when Google Play functionality is not present on the phone.
00:25:15 <TheJollyRoger> The third possibility: the app runs, but then displays no notifications, or goes inactive after you switch away from it, and then refuses to show notifications unless you open the app and start to use it.
00:25:29 <fretegi> excellent information thanks guys!
00:25:55 <bizanon[m]> TheJollyRoger: ok I got it to work. than you
00:25:56 <TheJollyRoger> Possibility 3 is symptomatic of the app authors allowing the app to run on its own, but relying on Google Play Services to tell the app to "wake up."
00:26:05 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Good!
00:26:26 <bizanon[m]> super super easy
00:26:38 <TheJollyRoger> What typically happens to these apps is that the app goes to "sleep" but then there is no Google Play to tell the app "Hey, wake up, I have messages for you!"
00:26:45 <TheJollyRoger> So it ends up going to sleep and then never waking back up.
00:27:11 <TheJollyRoger> (Phone apps are designed to "sleep" and then rely on a service to tell them to wake up, so that they don't consume more battery power than they have to)
00:27:18 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, i gotcha, cuz its completely sandboxed from everything else..
00:27:30 <TheJollyRoger> Well, this isn't a security thing, it's a battery saving thing.
00:27:46 <fretegi> ah
00:28:01 <TheJollyRoger> The improvements in phone battery lives are actually somewhat illusionary.
00:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> What really has improved phone battery life the most recently is actually software optimizations.
00:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> When the apps aren't being used, the operating system puts them in suspension, so that they aren't using more power than they have to.
00:28:51 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It's also in a way a developer time saving thing.  A centralized and well known API for everyone to use makes it easier to learn and easier for companies to hire developers to code against it.  And you don't have to build it yourself
00:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: oh yeah, huh, I didn't think of that, good point!
00:29:14 <mr_hebi_san[m]> or host the notification server
00:29:43 <TheJollyRoger> This allows the phone to "sleep" the apps and only wake up when it absolutely needs to, retrieve its messages as they arrive, and then immediately return to sleep. So that way, rather than have all the apps be running all the time and be eating up your battery, the phone only runs what it needs to.
00:30:00 <TheJollyRoger> Which leads us to possibility four:
00:30:35 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps, like Signal, are actually optimized to run without Google Play Services and have full capabilities when they do. Unfortunately, because there is no Google Play telling them "Hey wake up!" when they have to wake up, they have no choice but to remain running all the time.
00:31:10 <bizanon[m]> that makes sense
00:31:15 <TheJollyRoger> How much battery power they use will largely be dependent on how well their own respective app authors have designed them. For instance, Signal will barely use any battery power at all if it runs without Google Play Services there to tell it to wake up.
00:31:37 <TheJollyRoger> Since its authors were extremely diligent in making it conserve battery as much as it could.
00:31:44 <fretegi> funny you mention tht one in particular, im just now using that starting 2 days ago and feels like it hits battery a bit.  very little, excellent life still, just feels noticeable
00:31:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:32:29 <TheJollyRoger> However, on the other end of the spectrum...
00:32:39 <bizanon[m]> how does element compare to signal in terms of battery?
00:32:49 <TheJollyRoger> If you have an app like Revolution IRC, which must not only run in the foreground, but by design *must* remain connected to a server in order to function,
00:32:54 <TheJollyRoger> (because IRC is designed that way)
00:33:10 <TheJollyRoger> You could start the app and connect at breakfast time with a battery level of 100.
00:33:19 <TheJollyRoger> Your battery would hit zero before you even start getting hungry for lunch.
00:33:41 <TheJollyRoger> That's how dramatic the difference in software optimization is.
00:33:48 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Unfortunately, I don't know that.
00:34:21 <fretegi> wow, didnt realize it was that bad ha
00:34:25 <fretegi> so how about camera?
00:34:27 <TheJollyRoger> I do have opinions on it, but they are roughly half a year out of date.
00:34:42 <fretegi> i installed open camera, but is there one that is more inline with the google app?
00:34:42 <TheJollyRoger> What would you like to know about the camera?
00:35:03 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: unfortunately, Open Camera is about as close as you can get to Google Camera at this moment in time.
00:35:11 <bizanon[m]> ok TheJollyRoger:  After I flashed, I got a reboot notification on my pixel 2. I clicked reboot and it rebooted my pixel 2 NOT my pixel 5. Is this how it supposed to go?
00:35:11 <fretegi> copy
00:35:15 <TheJollyRoger> Although AOSP Camera is slooooowlllllly slowly slowly starting to get better.
00:35:44 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: No, that's not how it's supposed to go...
00:35:51 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: just do it using the computer.
00:36:11 <bizanon[m]> i'll try flashing again before going to computer
00:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: I cannot in good faith recommend you do anything with that Pixel 2 except send it for recycling.
00:36:43 <TheJollyRoger> It is no longer safe.
00:37:03 <bizanon[m]> yeah i never use it
00:37:11 <bizanon[m]> i just have it and wanted to try the webinstall w it
00:38:00 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: I have heard reports about people extracting the GCam .apk from a phone, and then installing it onto GrapheneOS along with some other Google applications, but that's an unsupported use case and it could stop working at any moment, should Google take their ball and go home, or should the loophole in the SELinux policy that permits it to work be removed.
00:38:30 <fretegi> and that would have to be sideloaded right?
00:38:34 <fretegi> iirc
00:38:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I haven't tried it myself and don't consider it a viable or sustainable approach, so unfortunately I can't provide any more than that and don't recommend you try it.
00:39:00 <fretegi> and all kinda stuff could break that i imagine
00:39:09 <TheJollyRoger> So unfortunately, at this moment the AOSP camera (which is included by default) and OpenCamera are probably your most solid bets.
00:39:26 <fretegi> gotcha
00:39:29 <TheJollyRoger> But I do have a good tip on OpenCamera: if you have the Pixel visual Core, OpenCamera can make use of it under settings.
00:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> Change the API to "Camera2."
00:39:53 <fretegi> pixel visual core? that a package that can be installed?
00:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> It's an auxiliary GPU on the flagship phones, it's a chip.
00:40:28 <TheJollyRoger> *it's an auxiliary chip, it's a GPU seen on the flagship phones.
00:40:32 <fretegi> ah... gotcha.. i got a cheapie 3a
00:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, yeah, you won't have the Pixel Visual Core on that one. But it will still take very good pictures nonetheless.
00:41:09 <fretegi> however... will be getting the wife a 4 now that this is working and that should work on that phone right?
00:41:52 <TheJollyRoger> Well, it's not as good as Google Camera unfortunately, but the photos do seem a tiny bit better with it.
00:41:54 <TheJollyRoger> Let me go and see.
00:41:56 <TheJollyRoger> I have a 4.
00:41:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment.
00:42:04 <TheJollyRoger> Since I haven't tested it with both ways.
00:44:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, my mistake. looks like it's almost the same. If there's a difference I cannot see it on the screen of this phone.
00:44:34 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, belay my last!
00:44:51 <fretegi> haha
00:44:59 <fretegi> we will blame it on the rum, cheers!
00:45:04 <coppermen[m]> https://www.wallstreetdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/8-26-Copper-Wire.jpg
00:45:04 <coppermen[m]> 😍         https://energymetalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Graphene-battery-feature-image.jpg 🤢
00:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> XP The rum indeed, ahahaha
00:47:19 <goodkmen[m]> How does graphene even mean?
00:47:26 <TheJollyRoger> How does what mean?
00:47:39 <goodkmen[m]> The name
00:48:02 <goodkmen[m]> Any reason why it call like that
00:48:07 <TheJollyRoger> Graphene is an allotrope of carbon which is theorized to be much stronger than steel.
00:48:27 <goodkmen[m]> Stronger than copper?
00:48:45 <TheJollyRoger> Trolling is not permitted.
00:49:21 <xx> It shows how much time they got on their hands to do stuff like that. I wish they spend their time concetracting on something more important.
00:49:31 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: Currently, 4a, 4a5G, and 5s are probably your best bet and best value for the money.
00:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> xx: yeah, really.
00:49:41 <fretegi> so just to confirm, the reset to factory option in settings > system just wipes data but keeps graphene installed right
00:49:52 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, not the 4 eh?
00:49:55 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: that's correct. Factory reset will get you a brand new installation of GrapheneOS.
00:50:13 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: yeah, the 4 is an older device by this point, and unfortunately...
00:50:17 * bizanon[m] uploaded an image: 20210228_184813.jpg (58KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qrFhPYRAbmjXkbORWewHlHnI/20210228_184813.jpg >
00:50:20 <bizanon[m]> Hey I got it
00:50:24 <bizanon[m]> Just gotta lock the bootloader now?
00:50:26 <xx> TheJollyRoger: I got it on 4a and 4XL. But since it was mentioned to stick with the newer device i reverted the 4XL back to stock
00:50:29 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Very good! Yes, lock your bootloader!
00:50:49 <TheJollyRoger> xx: well, you can stay with GrapheneOS on the 4XL, I currently run the 4 as a daily driver.
00:51:01 <TheJollyRoger> If I could say something about the 4...
00:51:04 <TheJollyRoger> It's a good phone, but...
00:51:25 <fretegi> yea Xl too big
00:51:32 <TheJollyRoger> For the money Google was asking people pay for it, it didn't present a very attractive value. A lot of people felt that for the money, it could have been better.
00:51:37 <fretegi> coming off note 8's.. just too damn big
00:51:49 <fretegi> so 5 it is
00:52:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Pixels have a supported lifespan of 3 years from the day they appear.
00:52:18 <TheJollyRoger> *appear on the Google store .
00:52:48 * bizanon[m] uploaded an image: 20210228_185230.jpg (58KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/egfSqrjZvTlrwKOCfkFVqZeQ/20210228_185230.jpg >
00:52:49 <bizanon[m]> After I locked bootloader I got this
00:53:16 <scarn[m]> Rip you
00:53:19 <strcat[m]> wasn't installed successfully
00:53:23 <strcat[m]> unlock and do it again
00:53:30 <bizanon[m]> ok
00:53:34 <fretegi> damn it
00:53:47 <bizanon[m]> <scarn[m] "Rip you"> dont scare me like that 😂
00:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Looks like the install wasn't completed, you'll have to unlock it and give it another go. The good news is though, she's not bricked, just the bootloader can't find the right image to boot from.
00:54:06 <scarn[m]> <bizanon[m] "dont scare me like that 😂"> 😋
00:55:06 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: because Pixels have a lifespan of 3 years from the day they are released, if you have the opportunity and budget to go with a newer device that is supported at the time of its release, that's generally the best.
00:55:33 <fretegi> yea i hear you
00:55:48 <fretegi> prolly right, despite my inclination to be a cheap a$$
00:55:54 <xx> I have an essential phone. Which I'm in love with its design and been using it as my work phone. But GrapheneOS is not an option for it. My main concern is privacy and tracking more than security. Any information on the option I got? Sticking with stock android is my best option?
00:56:11 <fretegi> which phone?
00:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hello xx, I'd like to refer you to #grapheneos-offtopic, the offtopic channel for discussions of operating systems that aren't GrapheneOS.
00:56:37 <scarn[m]> I remember the day i locked my bootloader with custom rom on moto g5, after that it was useless
00:57:19 <scarn[m]> Worst mistake ever
00:57:19 <xx> sorry thought this was offtopic
00:57:21 <fretegi> ha you reminded me, need to lock my bootloader.. i didnt do that step with grapheneos for that very reason
00:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> xx: no prob!
00:57:25 <strcat[m]> bizanon: must not have completed the installation
00:57:34 <TheJollyRoger> scarn[m]: Yikes that's rotten luck.
00:57:38 <strcat[m]> fretegi: really important and the install isn't finished without that
00:57:41 <bizanon[m]> strcat: im redoing it right now
00:57:44 <scarn[m]> <TheJollyRoger "scarn: Yikes that's rotten luck."> Yeah..
00:58:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Essential is a brand name for a line of phones fretegi , I think it was the line that pioneered notch designs
00:58:38 <fretegi> mr_hebi_san[m], ahhh i gotcha
00:59:30 <scarn[m]> "Notch design" pixel 3 🤔
01:03:34 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, odd, the Pixel 5 has the peephole. (I'm just looking at one right now)
01:05:10 <copperraider[m]> Im back :)
01:06:05 <TheJollyRoger> Haha, so that's what happens if we both click "ban" at the same time.
01:07:38 <bizanon[m]> "your device is loading a different OS" Think it worked now
01:07:49 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Yep, that's the screen you want to see!
01:07:49 <strcat> yes
01:07:54 <strcat> must just have not completed the install before
01:08:35 <bizanon[m]> yeah I think thats what happened. It rebooted itself before I even got a chance to lock bootloader.
01:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> welcome aboard the ship, bizanon[m].
01:09:42 <fretegi> so when i relock boot loader will it reset any data?
01:09:54 <fretegi> fine if it does. just want to take the proper precautions lol
01:09:56 <bizanon[m]> hey I've been with the ship since pixel  2 remember haha
01:09:58 <bizanon[m]> but good to be back
01:09:59 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: Yes.
01:10:06 <fretegi> oh doh!
01:10:11 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Yarr, well, welcome back!
01:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: Yeah, the secure element will change the keys. Any userdata you have left on that phone will be permanently lost.
01:10:35 <johnwicker[m]> Yes welcome back :D
01:10:51 <fretegi> and if you leave it unlocked?
01:11:00 <fretegi> other than security risks
01:11:05 <johnwicker[m]> <fretegi "and if you leave it unlocked?"> Thats fine
01:11:12 <johnwicker[m]> No risk there
01:11:45 <fretegi> kk cool thanks
01:11:49 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: if you leave the phone unlocked, all the bootloader security features will be disabled. Any security features that depend on verified boot similarly will fail to start.
01:11:57 <strcat[m]> fretegi: you need to lock to complete the GrapheneOS installation
01:12:03 <strcat[m]> fretegi: you can use Auditor to confirm
01:12:14 <strcat[m]> it's not fully functional / installed unlocked
01:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: looks like johnwicker was one of the trolls.
01:12:29 <strcat[m]> and yes, unlocking and locking wipes
01:12:36 <strcat[m]> we do our best to make sure people don't skip that step
01:12:47 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: yeah, you need to make sure the bootloader's locked.
01:13:06 <bizanon[m]> are any of you guys using payment apps like android pay or paypal on GOS? would it work or nah?
01:13:07 <TheJollyRoger> To prevent it from being unlocked again, you can go back into developer options by re-enabling them, and slide OEM unlocking to "off."
01:13:26 <TheJollyRoger> Then switch off Developer options.
01:13:36 <fretegi> and what if you leave it unlocked?
01:13:50 <TheJollyRoger> This way, if someone wants to unlock the bootloader of your phone, they must first factory reset it via recovery before they can get at that toggle a second time.
01:14:05 <fretegi> kk
01:14:51 <strcat[m]> fretegi: if it's unlocked, you haven't finished the install process and you don't have verified boot or other security features tied to this
01:15:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, don't leave it unlocked. The phone won't self-update and is insecure if it's not locked.
01:15:25 <strcat[m]> it doesn't impact updates
01:16:09 <TheJollyRoger> Er, wait, it doesn't? Oh, okay.
01:16:13 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops.
01:16:26 <meaterb[m]> Is there a way do disable  updates?
01:16:35 <strcat[m]> meaterb: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
01:16:47 <meaterb[m]> Let me check
01:17:20 <strcat[m]> are they switching between trolling and asking questions now?
01:17:52 <meaterb[m]> Can't find it
01:18:00 <strcat[m]> meaterb: read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
01:18:03 <meaterb[m]> On which page is it?
01:18:42 <strcat[m]> it's just the same troll
01:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I have to take a moment away from the computer, sorry.
01:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, invite only, okay, whew. Thanks.
01:19:20 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back soon.
01:20:10 <fretegi> got it thanks for the color guys.  ill circle back and lock boot loader
01:22:23 <SD79> Hey
01:22:51 <SD79> Can someone help me install the os?
01:23:25 <SD79> I forgot to say please sorry
01:24:21 <bizanon[m]> I just installed it on my p5
01:24:26 <bizanon[m]> u can pm me
01:24:35 <TheJollyRoger> hello SD79, I can't stay for the time being, but you can use the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web
01:25:38 <TheJollyRoger> This reduces the process down to roughly turning on OEM unlocking, rebooting your phone to fastboot by switching it off, then pressing Volume down + power, then visiting the webpage and clicking through the buttons.
01:25:55 <bizanon[m]> to use the auditor , do I need 2 GOS phones?
01:26:00 <strcat> bizanon[m]: no
01:26:05 <strcat> you can use an Android phone
01:26:13 <strcat> or you can use https://attestation.app/ service
01:26:15 <strcat> or both
01:29:35 <JohnMan> bizanon[m] I would dm you but I'm having issues making an account
01:30:30 <bizanon[m]> hmm i downloadded auditor to my other android phone but when Im trying to scan the 2nd QR code its not doing anything
01:31:41 <strcat[m]> maybe it has broken camera support
01:31:49 <strcat[m]> try centering it really well
01:31:51 <strcat[m]> in the box it shows
01:31:56 <strcat[m]> make sure there's enough light etc
01:32:30 <bizanon[m]> yeah worked with another phone
01:34:49 <bizanon[m]> so how do I know if the build is not modified? If it is successful then its good?
01:35:43 <bizanon[m]> nvm... It says "unmodified official release" duh
01:40:20 <brughehe[m]> test
01:45:51 <brughehe[m]> hello plz help
01:45:51 <strcat[m]> with what?
01:45:52 <brughehe[m]> im test matrix app
01:46:28 <brughehe[m]> thats all
01:46:30 <brughehe[m]> testing*
01:46:30 * bizanon[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gnFZgveKknSJHgjMBhZKQcNv/message.txt >
01:46:31 <strcat[m]> ok
01:46:40 <strcat[m]> bizanon: no, it doesn't
01:47:04 <bizanon[m]> ok great
01:47:14 <strcat[m]> bizanon: as I've said before, you're only confusing yourself looking at non-user-facing permissions which do not do what you think they do
01:47:27 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the Location permission controls whether apps can see location info including network names
01:48:24 <bizanon[m]> if I grant location permission control, app can see ALL AP names, even if im not connected to them?
01:49:11 <strcat[m]> the Location permission controls access to location info including list of cell towers, Wi-Fi networks, etc.
01:49:27 <brughehe[m]> @strcat i should your post on twitter with the lack  beta tester on older phones
01:49:28 <strcat[m]> the low-level permissions are required too but it's just not relevant, the Location permission is the user-facing one that matters
01:49:46 <bizanon[m]> ok i understand now
01:50:36 <zzxx123> You can just disable wifi scanning
01:50:59 <bizanon[m]> so using something like this https://f-droid.org/packages/com.wesaphzt.privatelocation/
01:50:59 <bizanon[m]> will it be able to spoof "location" ?
01:51:01 <strcat[m]> warmjuice: not relevant
01:51:05 <brughehe[m]> but how do make a copy of your android log cuz im wanting post bug with pixel 3a
01:51:25 <strcat[m]> warmjuice: disabled by default, not actually implemented and just not relevant to this
01:51:35 <b1101> I found aard2 dictionary doesn't start without network access. sits on a frozen screen.
01:51:54 <strcat[m]> b1101: report app bugs to app devs
01:51:58 <strcat[m]> no use reporting to us
01:52:10 <strcat[m]> file a bug with the app dev, clearly explain the problem to them
01:52:52 <brughehe[m]> holy shit this app is buggy as hell
01:52:57 <bizanon[m]> just to confirm, biometric data is also not accessible by new profiles I make right?
01:53:14 <bizanon[m]> if im not using biometric data on the profiles
01:53:49 <strcat[m]> not clear what you mean
01:53:54 <brughehe[m]> ✔
01:53:56 <strcat[m]> biometrics are not available to the OS in the first place
01:54:08 <brughehe[m]> ❌
01:54:24 <strcat[m]> brughehe: don't know what you're trying to say
01:54:48 <brughehe[m]> just ignore that
01:54:59 <brughehe[m]> i press wrong but
01:55:03 <bizanon[m]> im looking at the google app store, certain apps have permission to
01:55:03 <bizanon[m]> "use biometric hardware"
01:55:03 <bizanon[m]> And I setup fingerpring when I installed GOS on the main profile.
01:55:13 <strcat[m]> bizanon: again
01:55:19 <strcat[m]> the OS does not have access to biometric data
01:55:39 <strcat[m]> bizanon: and also, as I said, you're looking at the low-level non-user-facing permissions without privacy/security semantics
01:56:01 <strcat[m]> use biometric hardware permission means confirm stuff (like access to a keystore key) with it
01:56:17 <strcat[m]> the OS never has access to the biometric data, and of course an app doesn't
01:56:30 <strcat[m]> bizanon: just stop looking at the low-level perms, you're wasting your time and confusing yourself
01:56:42 <strcat[m]> the Play Store has legacy stuff because it supports pre-Android-6
01:56:45 <bizanon[m]> ok thanks for the explanation
02:00:45 <zzxx123> <strcat[m] "the Location permission controls"> isn't wifi network names for location permission provided by Wifi scanning under Location?
02:01:41 <bizanon[m]> yeah I see that setting
02:01:47 <bizanon[m]> I didn't know there was such a toggle. Very useful
02:02:10 <JohnMan> so huhh
02:02:15 <strcat[m]> warmjuice: no that's not relevant
02:02:21 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's not relevant
02:02:21 <JohnMan> I'm trying to flash the device now
02:02:23 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier
02:02:52 <JohnMan> But the flash-all.bin isn't flashing the phone
02:03:01 <JohnMan> Perhaps I have bad drivers?
02:03:20 <bizanon[m]> <JohnMan "Perhaps I have bad drivers?"> try web install its user friendly
02:03:22 <strcat[m]> JohnMan: you need to follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web (web installer, recommended) or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
02:03:36 <strcat[m]> if you're following an unofficial guide that's why it's not working
02:03:44 <JohnMan> yes
02:04:42 <strcat[m]> warmjuice: bizanon: those scanning options are for improving the OS location service, are disabled by default, and don't have an implementation anyway
02:04:50 <strcat[m]> warmjuice: bizanon: has nothing to do with app access
02:05:02 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier, Location permission controls access to location info including nearby networks
02:05:43 <bizanon[m]> then location is almost impossible to spoof right? because GPS isn't enough and it looks for APs near the phone etc
02:05:54 <strcat[m]> don't really know what you mean
02:06:06 <strcat[m]> and as I said earlier, those scanning options aren't enabled by default and aren't implemented
02:06:20 <strcat[m]> app access isn't the same as the OS providing location detection based on it
02:07:40 <bizanon[m]> my goal was to trick the app that I was at a certain location, but because of how location looks at cell towers and nearby APs and GPS and all that, its not possible is what I'm, thinking
02:08:34 <strcat[m]> bizanon: I'm not sure how that's really relevant
02:11:04 <strcat[m]> you'll get far more useful information if you ask questions based on what you want to achieve
02:11:31 <strcat[m]> instead of making assumptions and then asking really weird questions where the answer doesn't tell you what you actually want to know
03:23:52 <HowardR> The build instructions refer to an m shell command. How can I get it?
03:31:20 <strcat[m]> HowardR: it's included
03:31:30 <strcat[m]> need to set up environment properly
03:49:18 <marsgoals[m]> I've got a question on how to implement the built-in OS VPN support? Thanks :)
04:07:28 <TheJollyRoger> hi marsgoals[m], if you don't get an answer here, please don't ping me looking for one. To set up a VPN connection, your VPN service provider should tell you the settings you'll need to enter under Settings -> Network & Internet -> Advanced -> VPN.
04:08:02 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't have an app with preconfigured details for your VPN service provider, tap the "+" sign in the corner, and your VPN service provider should give you the settings that you will need to enter into it.
04:08:48 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't want apps bypassing the VPN, you should select "Always on VPN" and "Block connections without VPN"
04:10:29 <marsgoals[m]> K, I was previously setting up ProtonVPN but I saw this comment: •  21:14 strcat[m] and what I said about app based VPNs is that we do not specifically recommend them over the built-in OS VPN support.   From that comment I figured that I should probably not be using the ProtonVPN app?
04:11:34 <TheJollyRoger> Your VPN service provider should provide settings for you to connect to it. Follow that menu, and you should find where to input them.
04:11:56 <marsgoals[m]> K, will do, thanks :)
04:12:41 <TheJollyRoger> This part, I can't help you with. You'll need to take it from there once you see the menu.
04:16:46 <marsgoals[m]> K, thanks, I'll figure it out!
04:53:20 <hasnoname[m]> Is it possible to move the clear all recent to the bottom instead of scrolling all the way to the left?

06:17:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> K (@U​_can_call_me_k) has joined the Telegram Group!
06:18:51 <bushido-bol[m]> I picked up a pixel 4 xl on ebay unlocked and all, but got a network unlocked verizon phone, I sent that back and now Im thinking of just putting up for a pixel 5 to ensure I get a phone that can properly be unlocked
06:19:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> /test

06:21:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> hi
06:21:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> ok bridge works now
06:21:38 <dnull> Been on it for a week, no issues at all
06:23:02 <bushido-bol[m]> thats good to hear, I never got gps working quite right on my 3, I got around it using ddg to get a turn list but its too distracting, have you tried getting OSMand+ working on just raw gps?
06:23:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​enseiWang> bridge is going crazy in the offtopic group rn tho
06:23:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah that's because I need to restart the server to make it come up
06:23:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some bs
06:23:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just ignore
06:24:31 <dnull> Installed it but haven't used it. Gimme a sec.
06:25:03 <bushido-bol[m]> also where is the line between the main chat and off topic chat?
06:25:23 <bushido-bol[m]> dont wanna get off topic here
06:59:03 <jade22> Does using a sim card with graphene defeat its purpose?
07:00:56 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: No.
07:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: why would you think that? If you want cellular data, you need to pay the bills and your carrier needs to know who paid the bills so they can provide you connectivity.
07:01:56 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: everything you do with the internet is a transaction. Whether or not you want to take that transaction is a choice you're going to have to make.
07:02:29 <jade22> Just thinking on the premise of privacy
07:02:31 <bushido-bol[m]> given the depth of understanding in the hardware of their project, id assume they know how cell networks work
07:03:01 <bushido-bol[m]> by definition that would mean using a sim doesnt defeat its purpose
07:04:02 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS greatly improves on the security properties of the Android Open Source Project, with respect to things such as mitigating exploits, improvement of the sandboxing characteristics, and restricting application runtime environments. It improves on the privacy characteristics over the Google operating system, by not including Play Services as some of Play Services' functionality can be in
07:04:02 <jade22> Seeing how its tied to your identity unless you use prepaid I guess
07:04:04 <TheJollyRoger> many ways considered invasive.
07:04:17 <take_a_deep_brea> jade22:  graphene is a mobile OS . it is supposed to be used in the same way you would use stock Android OS . Or a device running samsung. if you feel that the Cell network service providers in your area threaten you/track your data   then yes using a SIM is clearly a problem. but otherwise you should do just fine with a regular SIM . also it is in general recommended not to use legacy phone calls /messages for
07:04:17 <take_a_deep_brea> communication and use something like Signal/Whatsapp/Threema
07:04:22 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: again, everything is a transaction. It's your choice as to whether or not you want to make that transaction or not.
07:04:40 <take_a_deep_brea> true
07:05:16 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: I'm personally fine with my cellphone service carrier knowing that I've paid my bills that month, because they provide me with a service that I want. If they didn't know that I paid the bills, they wouldn't be giving me a service and I would be tied to WiFi.
07:05:44 <TheJollyRoger> So no, it doesn't defeat the point of GrapheneOS for me, and quite the reverse: I'd consider not putting a SIM card into my phone to be defeating the point of having a phone.
07:06:09 <jade22> Good points
07:06:33 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: A phone without connectivity would not be very useful to me.
07:06:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Clearly you use one phone as a hotspot so that a wi-fi only phone can connect via it ;)
07:06:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> (its a joke :) )
07:06:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee hee
07:07:16 <bushido-bol[m]> dont laugh, i been there
07:07:18 <bushido-bol[m]> lol
07:07:32 <jade22> Lol
07:08:42 <bushido-bol[m]> anyone know anything about a wardriving script that could provide realistically reliable wifi anywhere? ive missed those projects since the wpa days
07:09:43 <TheJollyRoger> jade22: Out there in the real world, you've got to choose your battles. GrapheneOS can help you with respect to things such as avoiding the invasive aspects of Play Services, and making your phone more resistant to exploitation from malware and memory corruption vulnerabilities that Linux is usually very vulnerable to.
07:10:01 <TheJollyRoger> But it can't make life choices for you.
07:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> Similarly, gaining control over the outflow of information -- aka privacy -- is a complex and nuanced topic that multiple Ph.D thesises could be written on. Each approach is going to be as individual, as the person making it. There is no one-size-fits-all approach.
07:15:10 <mr_hebi_san[m]> TheJollyRoger: Mind if I dm a privacy question that could be better off-channel?
07:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> Sure what's up?
07:16:01 <bushido-bol[m]> if its not too private can I join in?
07:16:10 <TheJollyRoger> Alright let's go to #grapheneos-offtopic

09:36:35 <sinapius[m]> Good morning folks, I'm new to the whole Matrix thing as well as Graphene, so pardon me if I am asking at wrong channel.
09:36:35 <sinapius[m]>  Got a work profile now for my invasive apps, but I know its not the best solution to isolate and organize apps. I wonder about user profiles - can't they be integrated seamless into the Android like the work profile? How I can switch promptly between profiles, and log out quickly? Thank you. I appreciate the project.
09:48:49 <nscnt[m]> sinapius: You can quickly switch profiles by using the Quick Settings (swipe down from the top two times). At the bottom right there is a small icon representing "Users & guests" where you can select what you want to do.
09:49:33 <sinapius[m]> <nscnt[m] "sinapius: You can quickly switch"> Thanks! Appreciated.

14:06:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Or if installed on GrapheneOS, apps_packages Info
14:23:07 <hard_taffy[m]> What I'd also like to know more about is what data an app can collect that isn't controlled by permissions. For example, Pass2U Wallet* has permissions for, among others, add or modify calendar events and send email to guests without owners' knowledge; read phone status and identity; and find accounts on the device. What it be possible to use the app in a privacy-preserving way without losing core functionality? I
14:23:07 <hard_taffy[m]> guess denying the network permission would be best method unless it renders the app useless. * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.passesalliance.wallet
14:23:07 <hard_taffy[m]> 5e Companion App serves ads. Denying the network permission stops ads but seems to have prevented the app from launching unless the permission was allowed and then denied again.
14:24:31 <rny> these permission toggles are not designed for you to micromanage when your app has/does not have access
14:29:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <rny "these permission toggles are not">  apps can't just access your whole storage without the permission, can it?
14:31:12 <strcat> hard_taffy[m]: you're confusing yourself looking at low-level permissions not meant to expose any private info
14:31:18 <strcat> hard_taffy[m]: please look at the actual user-facing permissions
14:31:28 <strcat> hard_taffy[m]: don't look at the legacy listing on the Play Store designed for Android < 6
14:31:47 <strcat> please look at what the OS actually displays
14:32:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <rny "these permission toggles are not"> But yeah, you kinda have a point, developers dictate what functionalities are blocked and not blocked by what permissions, and what API or code to use
14:32:18 <strcat> for even remotely modern apps, standard Android permissions exposing private information are all disabled by default
14:32:48 <strcat> and for legacy apps, they have a prompt about it before they can launch (not going to see that much since it's for apps not updated for Android 6 and above)
14:33:58 <strcat> Network and Sensors are added by us and therefore don't work the same way because apps aren't designed around them existing
14:56:35 <hard_taffy[m]> Thanks for the information, gents.

15:50:10 <idkrn[m]1> so as long as i dont get a locked version i dont have to worry about anything?
15:51:27 <strcat[m]> idkrn: I mean in theory someone replaced the touchscreen with a malicious component
15:51:27 <strcat[m]> or w/e
15:51:35 <strcat[m]> idkrn: seems unlikely
15:53:27 <idkrn[m]1> yea i was just asking about if there were any general problems i would need to look out for
15:53:33 <entry1[m]> <idkrn[m]1 "so as long as i dont get a locke"> Technically no, the phone could be financed and the seller could stop paying the bill on it, which would cause the carrier to blacklist it from the network. Newer devices face this problem versus older ones. The price difference between the 4a new and used is about 14%, so not worth it in my opinion. Buying used should save minimum 30% if you want to do it.
15:53:46 <dannyknoll3[m]> idkrn: If your threat model includes your hardware being intercepted, find a more anonymous way/person to order. Use your imagination.
15:54:23 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The only option to avoid hardware interception is to buy the device personally on Google store
15:54:27 <idkrn[m]1> nah im not being targeted if this happened to me itll only happen by accident lol
15:54:51 <dannyknoll3[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "The only option to avoid hardwar"> and pick it up from them in person?
15:55:09 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yes
15:55:17 <idkrn[m]1> <entry1[m] "Technically no, the phone could "> ill keep this in mind
15:57:35 <idkrn[m]1> is carrier firmware replaced by graphene?
15:59:19 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yeah iirc, unless it does not allow you to unlock bootloader like Verizon
16:02:58 <idkrn[m]1> got it
16:02:59 <idkrn[m]1> * gotcha
16:26:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​roupAnonymousBot> Send me your current config file

16:26:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​roupAnonymousBot> Do we need to message the freenode people?
16:26:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Probably
16:29:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Btw a bit of a rate limit while we figure out how to do that with the bot
16:29:10 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to need to get Sigyn to exempt the GrapheneOS-Telegram bot.
16:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> Just looking that up now.
16:29:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> If you can do that we probably don't need a rate limit
16:30:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Our current rate limit seems to be 40 messages a minute
16:30:31 <ry`an> can we get a facebook bridge too

17:39:56 <thetrueperson[m]> Hey, i like do say something to the grapheneos team first off i was the person who raided this chat for a week now and i to say i will leave guys alone for good.
17:40:34 <thetrueperson[m]> And i quited my job at copperhead
17:42:02 <thetrueperson[m]> So if you ban me right now than i will leave you guys alone for good

17:44:11 <take_a_deep_brea> thetrueperson:  why you are doing ... ummm , this ^ , now ?
17:44:36 <skagreek[m]> Hi. Possible issue in beta, but I'll ask here first before posting to github. On first boot, when you try to restore a backup, if you have the wrong words or incorrect files on USB, it will give the error" No suitable backups found at given location."  Then if you reboot and try again, that same error occurs WITHOUT having a chance to even enter backup location.
17:44:45 <thetrueperson[m]> They pay me for 10 euro per hour
17:44:51 <grapheneos_user_> Damn, you really made history
17:45:04 <grapheneos_user_> But really could you give us more information?
17:46:01 <thetrueperson[m]> Like what?
17:46:01 <grapheneos_user_> Not joking this time, I legitimately want to know
17:46:01 <take_a_deep_brea> thetrueperson:  yes , like as a proof of good faith
17:46:02 <jj1013> thetrueperson: First of all, *quit. Second, why did you not enter cryptocurrency mining or faucet hunting if you really were desperate on money? I have got like 4 USD out of that. Venezuelan here, we children do not really have our own money.
17:46:02 <take_a_deep_brea> otherwise just wasting time
17:46:03 <take_a_deep_brea> trolling , even some would say
17:46:04 <grapheneos_user_> Such as thetrueperson: how many trolls there are, their tactics of trolling, etc.
17:46:40 <zzxx123> <thetrueperson[m] "They pay me for 10 euro per hour"> proof?your chat history with copperhead?

17:54:18 <jj1013> thetrueperson[m]: I thought you were the one who exposed himself just saying in the chat openly that they paid you 10 EUR... Anyway, what case (have not heard of such a thing)? Does Copperhead state if they are ever going to stop (stupid question ain't it)?
17:54:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> I don't think so, though using microg with no sigproof (so no security issues) do make a lot of apps usable
17:54:42 <thetrueperson[m]> There is more to the story that i can't tell only to scrcat
17:54:49 <jj1013> thetrueperson[m]: What social media did they find you on?

17:56:26 <jj1013> bharr01: Not a dev, but I would install adb and fastboot just in case.

17:56:54 <jj1013> bharr01: You should wait for a dev's reply.
17:57:11 <jj1013> GrapheneOS-Teleg: Telegram group? That is a new one.
17:57:11 <bharr01> @jj1013 Ok, thanks!

17:57:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> But they complain a lot about haha
17:57:53 <Miaourt> Yes, but some do hehe
17:58:51 <jj1013> bharr01: Please do not try again the installation. I did so when a smartphone's USB disconnected, then it basically became paperweight. Not sure if it was the ROM's fault, but I still would not.
17:59:00 <jj1013> It was a Samsung.
17:59:22 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <bharr01 "Hello, I'm using the web install"> Try closing other applications other than the browser with web installer on it
17:59:51 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> And plugging a high quality usb cable on other ports at the back of desktop
18:00:02 <bharr01> DHFuchsiaOSwhen: Ok, thanks.  I'll give that a try

18:03:16 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <bharr01 "CrowmacMcCarthy: I was using a M"> Documentation recommend USB A to C

18:04:12 <strcat[m]> or to believe other stuff they say
18:04:13 <strcat[m]> probably just more people from that community trolling this channel
18:04:15 <strcat[m]> I don't expect it to stop
18:05:52 <strcat[m]> jj1013: GrapheneOS doesn't have support for any Samsung devices so I don't know how you could possibly be trying to install on it
18:06:16 <strcat[m]>  * jj1013: GrapheneOS doesn't have official support for any Samsung devices so I don't know how you could possibly be trying to install on it
18:06:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Doubt we'd ever include Samsung btw
18:06:38 <strcat[m]> bharr01: use the USB-C cable that comes with the phone, and try the install process again, and make sure not to interrupt it
18:06:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> No proper kernel release either
18:06:52 <strcat[m]> bharr01: read what it says about not interrupting it by interacting with the menu it shows
18:07:04 <strcat[m]> bharr01: you could start the web install flashing process over again, and make sure to use the cable that comes with the phone
18:07:20 <strcat[m]> bharr01: reboot the device back to the bootloader interface, and make sure not to interrupt the flashing process, it sounds like you may have done that
18:07:39 <strcat[m]> bharr01: worth noting Pixel 2 is obsolete and only has legacy support but still should be possible to install on it atm
18:08:38 <jj1013> strcat[m]: No, I was trying to install a STOCK ROM on the Samsung. That is why I think it was the ROMs fault, I think I used the wrong one.
18:09:29 <strcat[m]> jj1013: I don't really understand what that has to do with them installing GrapheneOS via web installer
18:09:56 <jj1013> strcat[m]: Me telling them not to try again the installation. It could mess up the phone.
18:10:08 <jj1013> I told them to wait for a dev's reply.
18:10:14 <strcat[m]> it won't mess up the phone
18:10:17 <strcat[m]> the installer is safe
18:10:43 <strcat[m]> it sounds like it was interrupted by a faulty USB connection or them rebooting the phone from fastbootd mode
18:11:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Weird question but any way to call someone with an assurance they won't record it?
18:12:10 <jj1013> Talking about the web installer. I am going to get a Pixel 4a or 5, will the Web Installer detect if the phone is compatible (model number seems to have to do with the ROM for some phones, not sure if Pixel's the same)?
18:12:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<clannad> Weird question but any"> Wish there is such an assurance
18:12:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> The web installer will auto detect and flash the correct release
18:12:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Same as not being able to screen record or type conversations
18:13:30 <strcat[m]> jj1013: our site covers everything
18:13:36 <strcat[m]> jj1013: there is nothing to detect
18:13:58 <jj1013> strcat[m]: Thanks!
18:14:30 <strcat[m]> jj1013: the phone model for the firmware and OS is "Pixel 4a", there are no variations
18:14:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> DHFuchsiaOSwhen oh, ok
18:14:37 <strcat[m]> jj1013: for all of those phones
18:14:57 <strcat[m]> jj1013: the hardware variations are minor and do not impact what runs on it
18:15:15 <strcat[m]> jj1013: we explain there to avoid buying carrier variants of the phones, but the same OS/firmware runs on those, that's not the difference
18:15:23 <strcat[m]> and the web installer is safe
18:16:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Actually web installer is safer than downloading a script and running it for the same thing
18:16:16 <strcat[m]> and it's wrong to tell people not to redo it if the process was interrupted
18:16:17 <strcat[m]> redoing it is what they need to do
18:16:17 <strcat[m]> ideally after fixing whatever was wrong like a broken USB cable/port
18:16:40 <BrunoYerma[m]> Hi. I am a newbie here.
18:16:40 <BrunoYerma[m]> Would anyone know why apps do not install themselves in Aurora Store? I am asking to, the app store works for a few seconds, then I have to ask again to install the app. Any idea will be welcome. 😇
18:16:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> What do you mean
18:16:59 <jj1013> AFAIK, Venezuelans do not really buy carrier-locked phones. Everything sold in here, from what I see, is unlocked. Carriers do not seem to sell locked phones anymore on Venezuela these days.
18:17:10 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<clannad> Actually web installer"> ^^
18:17:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Zero chance of flashing wrong images too
18:18:07 <jj1013> Have not heard of a smartphone that was stated to be locked, in MercadoLibre Venezuela (our go-to place to buy stuff, kind of like eBay).
18:18:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> jj1013Carrier unlocking and actually being able to unlock are different things
18:18:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Unlock the bootloader I mean
18:19:11 <jj1013> I know that. It is easier to unlock the bootloader in my opinion... depending on the manufacturer.
18:19:27 <bharr01> strcat[m]: I don't touch the phone so I don't think it's getting interrupted.  It always fails at the exact same spot, Writing Vendor about 3/4 of the way through.  I've tried multiple usb cables and multiple ports on the MacBook.  I'm not sure why it keeps giving the 1000ms exceeded error

18:32:16 <strcat[m]> it's a legacy permission, there's nothing that actually requires it
18:32:37 <strcat[m]> bharr01: which browser are you using?
18:33:09 <bharr01> strcat[m]: Google Chrome on Mac OS Big Sur (Updated to latest version)
18:33:35 <strcat[m]> bharr01: and make sure it's not in Incognito mode
18:34:06 <strcat[m]> bharr01: maybe that timeout is just too short, don't know
18:34:18 <strcat[m]> it's flashing atm for me
18:35:01 <bharr01> strcat[m]: Yeah, it's not in incognito mode.  Not sure why it's failing for me.
18:35:50 <strcat[m]> bharr01: I'd recommend using CLI install for now
18:36:12 <strcat[m]> bharr01: Pixel 2 / 2 XL are legacy and I would have expected web install to work but not really surprising if it doesn't atm
18:36:31 <bharr01> strcat[m]: Ok, I'll give it a shot.  Thanks

18:42:22 <vainisha[m]> Is my first time using this type of forums, so I'm kind of dumb you know

19:20:20 <RoyValentine[m]> nullnode dazinism Aaaaand were back to SeedVault not showing up in the backups section after the last OTA release. But now it shows Backup is on in the settings but a black screen when clicking into it.
19:22:53 <RoyValentine[m]> My last successful backup of apps was the 26th and my OTA happened on the 27th. Possibly has something to do with SeedVault integration into GrapheneOS?
19:24:01 <RoyValentine[m]>  * My last successful backup of apps was the 26th and my OTA happened on the 27th. Maybe my phone OTA startup after install just breaks SeedVault.
19:26:51 <strcat> RoyValentine[m]: there's nothing special about how it's integrated into GrapheneOS
19:27:07 <strcat> need to report Seedvault bugs to the Seedvault devs
19:28:31 <strcat[m]> only heard about the issue from you though
19:28:35 <RoyValentine[m]> <strcat "need to report Seedvault bugs to"> Already did that here but there is nothing you can see that helps investigate why this is happening: https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/213
19:28:54 <strcat[m]> you'll need to figure out what it is about your setup that breaks it
19:28:57 <strcat[m]> for only you
19:29:48 <strcat> we don't make any modifications to Seedvault and aren't the developers of it
19:29:56 <strcat> you need to report bugs there
19:30:30 <strcat> <bool name="def_backup_enabled">true</bool>
19:30:32 <strcat> <string name="def_backup_transport" translatable="false">com.stevesoltys.seedvault.transport.ConfigurableBackupTransport</string>
19:30:36 <strcat> that is the extent of the OS integration for it
19:31:01 <strcat> there's nothing else beyond including the app
19:31:09 <RoyValentine[m]> Just reporting that the OTA yet again broke it for me. Obviously if no one else has reported this issue then there is something weird on my device specifically.
19:32:02 <RoyValentine[m]> The issue is that the number of things that it could be if the issue is apps being backed up, apps running on start after OTA restart, etc is just a large task and obviously very specific to my use case.
19:32:21 <strcat> I doubt the update broke anything for you
19:33:05 <strcat> just because you noticed a problem after booting up a new version of the OS doesn't mean it broke because of an update
19:33:17 <strcat> RoyValentine[m]: you'll need to work it out with the Seedvault developers
19:33:19 <strcat> it's not an OS issue
19:33:23 <strcat> we can't help
19:33:34 <strcat> we make 0 changes to Seedvault
19:33:46 <strcat> we include the unmodified upstream code
19:34:19 <RoyValentine[m]> I'm not saying it is an OS issue haha. It is just the timing of each break seems to coincide with an install of the OTA. So it is something to do with what is running on my device after the OTA finishes/restarts.
19:34:38 <strcat> or it's broken after a reboot
19:34:43 <RoyValentine[m]> Thus if somehow someone has the same problem they can see a conversation here or in the logs.
19:35:04 <RoyValentine[m]> <strcat "or it's broken after a reboot"> True and maybe I will test that out. Thanks.
19:35:06 <strcat> no one else has ever reported any similar issue
19:35:55 <RoyValentine[m]> Which is why I just reported back again. Someone, if they ever do, has the issue and comes here they can be redirected to SeedVault.
19:37:20 <strcat> you should try to get better logs to give to the Seedvault devs
19:37:28 <strcat> overly specific filter being used
19:37:59 <strcat> it's not a GrapheneOS issue or something related to how we integrate it
19:44:12 <RoyValentine[m]> <strcat "overly specific filter being use"> What do you mean by overly specific filter? What the dev wrote back on the github issue?
19:44:50 <strcat> yes
19:45:14 <strcat> RoyValentine[m]: clear logs (adb logcat -c), trigger the issue, get logs with adb logcat -d, give them the logs
19:45:26 <strcat> filter out stuff from other apps that you don't want there if desired
19:45:54 <strcat> remove more stuff and there's a lower chance of it being useful log output
19:48:34 <RoyValentine[m]> Let's say the issue exists specifically for me after a restart. How do you tail logs of the restarting device to see the issue?
19:48:57 <strcat> adb logcat
19:49:15 <strcat> you don't need to pass arguments
19:49:26 <strcat> by default it dumps all the current logs and continues showing future output
19:49:32 <strcat> -d makes it just dump and stop
19:49:43 <strcat> passing a bunch of arguments is overcomplicating it
19:49:49 <strcat> get all the logs and then search through them
19:50:13 <RoyValentine[m]> I mean you plug in the device, turn on USB debugging, restart the device? The adb session will still exist and keep looking for a device to reconnect and log?
19:50:28 <RoyValentine[m]> I haven't used adb in a long time so just wondering.
19:52:32 <interesting[m]> anyone knows if I can disable trackers for specific app I have installed on graphene through aurorastore?
19:52:39 <interesting[m]> aurorastore shows which trackers app using
19:53:49 <p1trson[m]> folks, I am now going to install graphene os on my brand new 4a 5G. I didn't even turn it on with stock OS. My question is -  do I have to? It's not mentioned in the official installation docu, so I assume I don't have to. I just wanted to double check 🤞
19:54:35 <interesting[m]> you need to enable oem unlock or something in the stock first
19:54:45 <interesting[m]> afaik
19:55:06 <p1trson[m]> I mean this as well
19:55:06 <p1trson[m]> ```It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early in the installation process.```
19:55:26 <p1trson[m]> and yes @in
19:55:55 <p1trson[m]> and yes interesting I need it for OEM unlocking ..didn't reach this part in docu. so cheers - I hope it will be smooth
19:59:46 <strcat[m]> interesting: Aurora is giving misleading information which doesn't mean what you think
20:00:00 <strcat[m]> interesting: what you should do is not give apps access to data, permissions or other access you don't want them to have
20:00:25 <strcat[m]> interesting: read past discussions if you want more info, off-topic beyond that
20:00:34 <mr_hebi_san[m]> p1trson I have always needed to at least establish a network connection before the device would allow me to toggle the OEM switch
20:01:15 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I never log into Google or set up anything on the phone beforehand though
20:01:15 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "interesting: read past discussio"> hmm for example aurora store showing 0 trackers for signal app, and 11 trackers for viber.
20:01:23 <strcat[m]> interesting: as I said
20:01:31 <strcat[m]> don't give the app data, permissions or other access you don't want it to have
20:01:42 <strcat[m]> apps don't have any of the standard permissions for accessing user data, etc. by default
20:01:43 <interesting[m]> I see thanks
20:01:47 <strcat[m]> they have to ask for it
20:01:53 <interesting[m]> I see
20:02:19 <strcat[m]> interesting: the way they are portraying apps using third party libraries providing crash analytics, etc. is highly misleading, and misleads users
20:02:28 <strcat[m]> interesting: an app not having that does not mean an app is privacy respecting
20:02:37 <strcat[m]> and an app having those libraries does not mean it 'tracks' you
20:02:54 <interesting[m]> thanks for explaining this
20:02:56 <strcat[m]> interesting: it's misleading info, and you're not considering that apps are sandboxed with you in control of what they can access
20:03:52 <interesting[m]> well now I do consider that
20:03:52 <interesting[m]> 👀
20:03:53 <strcat[m]> so, for example, if you give Signal access to your contacts, it uploads them to their server
20:03:53 <strcat[m]> you do not have to give it access to contacts
20:03:54 <strcat[m]> it works without doing that
20:03:54 <strcat[m]> it's a choice
20:04:39 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "you do not have to give it acces"> holy f*uck
20:04:39 <strcat[m]> some apps may refuse to work without giving them a certain permission they demand, in which case you can run them in a user profile where your personal info isn't available through permissions
20:04:40 <interesting[m]> wtf
20:05:02 <strcat[m]> but if that does happen (i.e. apps unnecessarily refusing to run without a permission) you should definitely file a bug report with the app dev and leave a negative review on the Play Store about it
20:05:15 <strcat[m]> interesting: you can also disable that Signal feature, and only give it contacts access after disabling it, but you can also just choose not to trust it with contacts access
20:05:19 <strcat[m]> I'm just giving an example
20:05:20 <strcat[m]> you're in control
20:05:31 <strcat[m]> you do not have to give apps access to stuff you don't want
20:05:39 <interesting[m]> thanks man
20:05:45 <strcat[m]> if they refuse to run without granting a permission, you can run it in a separate user profile where that permission doesn't give access to any data
20:06:01 <strcat[m]>  * if they refuse to run without granting a permission like contacts or legacy storage access, you can run it in a separate user profile where that permission doesn't give access to any data
20:06:23 <snooopy> I'm running signal without access to my phonebook and it works well :)
20:06:24 <strcat[m]>  * if they refuse to run without granting a permission like contacts or the legacy permission for accessing all your files stored outside of apps, you can run it in a separate user profile where that permission doesn't give access to any data
20:06:45 <strcat[m]> yeah giving an example of where you can simply say no and still use it
20:06:46 <strcat[m]> which is generally how things should be
20:07:06 <strcat[m]> and if that's not how it is, leave them a 1 star review if requiring the permission is clearly not necessary (it rarely would be) and file a bug
20:07:08 <snooopy> yeah
20:07:21 <strcat[m]> leave a 1 star review talking about their lack of respect for user consent and privacy
20:07:26 <strcat[m]> that is how people could make app devs care
20:07:34 <strcat[m]> cause if they get a ton of 1 star reviews about that, they will care
20:07:46 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "if they refuse to run without gr"> hm I need to read up on user profiles, I don't quite understand it. can I switch back and forth between profiles fast? or i'd have to reboot or something
20:07:59 <strcat[m]> interesting: you can switch between profiles
20:08:01 <snooopy> interesting[m]: It works pretty fast.
20:08:11 <interesting[m]> I see
20:08:12 <snooopy> YWithout rebooting
20:08:21 <strcat[m]> interesting: enable multiple users in Settings -> System and you can have separate user profiles with their own lock method, encryption keys, etc.
20:08:31 <strcat[m]> and each one has separate instances of apps, separate profile data
20:08:40 <strcat[m]> apps can't share data/communicate across user profiles
20:08:48 <snooopy> But if you reboot your phone, you have to log in yourself into the main user profile to get access to the others
20:09:23 <strcat[m]> interesting: so our recommendation is that for a badly behaving app which refuses to run without access to say, contacts, run that in a separate user profile if you really need to
20:09:45 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Regarding the Sensors permission that Graphene adds, it's really interesting to see.  I also get why it would be granted by default.  I'm curious though, if there are specific apps that a person would want to deny this permission to, that don't require the permission to be useful (or work at all)
20:10:02 <interesting[m]> strcat: thanks this is all really helpful
20:11:13 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: you can remove it for most apps, wouldn't recommend fiddling with permissions for base system components though
20:12:22 <strcat[m]> eventually we'll be changing it so that it only assumes it's required for user installed apps, not base system ones where we can manually add it to everything that actually needs it, but it will be a fair bit of work and will cause a bunch of regressions
20:12:58 <interesting[m]> what are sensors exactly? for example buttons for sound and power are sensors?
20:13:15 <strcat[m]> no
20:13:16 <interesting[m]> or stuff like accelerometer of fingerprint scanner? those are sensors?
20:13:20 <strcat[m]> buttons are not sensors
20:13:40 <interesting[m]> because lots of apps ask for sensors access
20:13:41 <strcat[m]> fingerprint scanner isn't considered a sensor and even the OS can't get the fingerprint scanner data
20:13:50 <strcat[m]> interesting: no apps ask for sensors access
20:13:56 <strcat[m]> sensors is not a standard Android permission
20:13:59 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "fingerprint scanner isn't consid"> 😮
20:14:13 <strcat[m]> it's added by GrapheneOS, therefore, GrapheneOS has to assume that everything requires it
20:14:38 <strcat[m]> Network and Sensors toggles are added by GrapheneOS, therefore, they are enabled by default for compatibility, unlike all the standard permissions
20:14:42 <strcat[m]> apps do not declare if they need sensors access so all apps must be assumed to need it
20:14:44 <p1trson[m]> so turned the stock OS on. It asked me for update to Android 11, I assume that's ok to do it before flashing graphene?
20:14:44 <interesting[m]> hmm
20:14:51 <strcat[m]> you can disable Sensors access for most apps
20:14:53 <strcat[m]> as I said
20:15:06 <strcat[m]> don't go fiddling with system apps (just don't toggle on showing them)
20:15:16 <gocho_ingles> <strcat[m] fingerprint scanner isn't considered a sensor and even the OS can't get the fingerprint scanner data> What. I always thought the OS would log on my fingerprint.
20:15:28 <gocho_ingles> gocho_ingles: If it wanted to.
20:15:30 <strcat[m]> the OS doesn't have access to fingerprint data
20:15:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Clarence (@E​arlOfEmsworth) has joined the Telegram Group!
20:15:51 <strcat[m]> the hardware just tells it when the user successfully authenticated with it
20:15:55 <gocho_ingles> strcat[m]: Do the apps?
20:16:00 <strcat[m]> no
20:16:02 <strcat[m]> the OS doesn't have it
20:16:06 <strcat[m]> so by definition the apps do not
20:16:17 <strcat[m]> no app can get access to fingerprint data
20:16:21 <strcat[m]> the OS doesn't have it in the first place
20:16:27 <strcat[m]> that's not how that works
20:16:56 <gocho_ingles> strcat[m]: Is it kernel-based or something?
20:16:59 <strcat[m]> it's not an IR camera used by the OS, there's a hardware/firmware implementation of fingerprint scanning, the OS just interfaces with it, doesn't deal with the details
20:17:03 <strcat[m]> no, the kernel is the OS
20:17:47 <strcat[m]> an app using the fingerprint scanner just means the app uses it to do authentication, it has no access to the data from it
20:17:50 * interesting[m] uploaded an image: cd74032f-5270-4a27-b816-80e88f470efb.jpg (43KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SFcYkPOCXkhlDUfFjcfChQJq/cd74032f-5270-4a27-b816-80e88f470efb.jpg >
20:17:52 <strcat[m]> the OS itself doesn't have that access
20:17:57 <interesting[m]> what does this mean then?
20:18:20 <strcat[m]> what does what mean?
20:18:28 <interesting[m]> it says all apps have access to sensors
20:18:29 <strcat[m]> already explained above
20:18:33 <interesting[m]> ah sorry
20:18:34 <interesting[m]> let me read
20:20:10 <p1trson[m]> so turned the stock OS on 4a 5G. It asked me for update to Android 11, I assume that's ok to do it before flashing grapheneos? (sorry for the questions, just trying to be careful for the first time)
20:20:20 <strcat[m]> Sensors and Network are toggles added by GrapheneOS, therefore, they are granted by default for compatibility since apps do not have code to check whether they are granted and request them as they do for standard permissions
20:20:32 <gocho_ingles> <strcat[m]: there's a hardware/firmware implementation of fingerprint scanning, the OS just interfaces with it> Then my fingerprint will be compromised if I use a device with intrusive *hardware*, such as devices with MediaTek and such...
20:20:35 <strcat[m]> apps already declare if they need network access though, so GrapheneOS knows which apps actually need that
20:21:21 <strcat[m]> gocho_ingles: the OS having access to it would not make things better, that clearly doesn't make any sense
20:21:52 <ry`an> gocho_ingles: you could always wear gloves
20:21:57 <strcat[m]> the OS works with fingerprints as opaque things it doesn't know about
20:22:16 <strcat[m]> it's unnecessary for the OS to have access to the actual fingerprint data, so it doesn't
20:22:28 <gocho_ingles> ry`an: Funny. The Samsung I have has no fingerprint reader.
20:22:44 <gocho_ingles> This is getting off-topic so I will shut up...
20:22:51 <strcat[m]> the fingerprint scanner sends data to secure element or TEE, and those implement fuzzy hashing of it and store the hashes
20:23:03 <ry`an> gocho_ingles: you might accidentally touch the camera
20:23:04 <strcat[m]> OS doesn't get to have the data
20:23:08 <strcat[m]> just not how it's implemented
20:23:55 <strcat[m]> the OS just has to deal with telling it when it needs to be active
20:24:07 <strcat[m]> and then dealing with the events from it
20:24:10 <strcat[m]> etc
20:25:51 <gocho_ingles> strcat[m]: I was wrong twice. Who would have thought.
20:25:57 <gocho_ingles> ry`an: Surely it will not pick anything comprehensible, the camera is potato-like.
20:26:26 <strcat[m]> it's an IR camera only really meant to scan stuff touching it not a visual spectrum camera
20:26:36 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't necessarily call it a camera at all
20:26:49 <strcat[m]> the face scanning thing is more of an actual IR camera
20:27:05 <strcat[m]> but that was exclusive to Pixel 4 and 4 XL
20:27:14 <strcat[m]> gone on the newer devices
20:27:18 <gocho_ingles> strcat[m]: I honestly never associated camera with fingerprint reader.
20:27:27 <strcat[m]> it is kinda an IR camera but not really
20:27:34 <strcat[m]> the face scanning thing is an actual 3D IR camera setup
20:28:26 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 4 IR camera stuff is actually usable by apps afaik
20:28:46 <strcat[m]> just usual camera perm

21:18:41 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 and 2 XL web install issue should be fixed now btw, they have an implementation flaw in their flash command where it returns prematurely before it's actually done, so a timeout was being triggered for the next command
21:18:48 <strcat[m]> legacy devices anyway
21:31:15 <p1trson[m]> folks just trying to
21:31:15 <p1trson[m]> ```./flash-all.sh``` on my ubunti 20.04 (after following all the preceding steps)
21:31:25 <p1trson[m]> *ubuntu
21:31:32 <p1trson[m]> it seems it's doing nothing
21:31:39 <p1trson[m]> for more than 20min
21:31:44 <strcat[m]> p1trson: you might have missed installing the udev rule package
21:31:50 <strcat[m]> it should immediately have output
21:31:51 <p1trson[m]> phone stays in fastboot mode
21:31:59 <strcat[m]> means your USB connection isn't working
21:32:03 <strcat[m]> either hardware issue or OS issue
21:32:07 <strcat[m]> broken cable, broken port, or broken OS
21:32:12 <strcat[m]> make sure you did the udev rule step
21:32:51 * p1trson[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/mlKjNXCFNARDOoXfWtcKMccb/message.txt >
21:32:52 <p1trson[m]> that's in my dmesg
21:33:33 <p1trson[m]> I did the part concerning  Flashing as non-root
21:33:50 * p1trson[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rzXgpqZcDNivjNzuCZWJZwjW/message.txt >
21:34:12 <strcat[m]> and then you have to connect the device after doing that
21:34:13 <strcat[m]> not before
21:34:37 <p1trson[m]> I did reconnect it after that
21:35:02 <p1trson[m]> the ```fastboot flashing unlock  worked as well
21:35:13 <strcat[m]> perhaps broken USB cable then
21:35:20 <strcat[m]> make sure the phone is in fastboot mode
21:35:25 <strcat[m]> try a different USB port
21:35:29 <strcat[m]> use cable that comes with the phone ideally
21:35:41 <p1trson[m]> it is in the fastboot mode and it says it's unlocked
21:35:57 <p1trson[m]> when trying different ports do I have to reboot it? (it's in fastboot mode now)
21:36:30 <strcat[m]> no
21:36:49 <strcat[m]> although you could try rebooting it (can use the option to reboot back to bootloader interface on the phone)
21:36:56 <strcat[m]> (or just reboot and hold power down again)
21:37:07 <p1trson[m]> I did that once alreadt
21:37:29 <p1trson[m]> any verification I can do from within the os to test?
21:40:42 <p1trson[m]> let me try to use the cable which came with the phone. although I don't understand why is is usbc on both sides ( right now I've used samsung one which I used to flash my Pinephone with for instance)
21:41:47 <strcat> because USB-C is the modern connector
21:42:14 <strcat> on laptops and desktops too, but desktops are less prone to going full USB-C at this point since it's more expensive and they aren't size limited
21:42:27 <strcat> sounds like you're probably using a broken cable
21:42:33 <p1trson[m]> I'll give it a try and report back 🤞
21:43:02 <strcat> ~50% of USB-A to USB-C cables are non-spec / broken
21:43:22 <p1trson[m]> so
21:43:38 <p1trson[m]> connected with original pixel cable to my usbc port on my laptop
21:43:44 <p1trson[m]> it immediately started to work
21:44:04 <hypokeimenon[m]> Are there some known good brands for USB cables?
21:44:17 <strcat> apple, google, anker, among others
21:44:34 <strcat> can't trust random cables
21:44:38 <strcat> they are also fire hazards
21:44:44 <strcat> often cut corners and are dangerous with fast charging
21:44:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> Anker
21:45:13 <p1trson[m]> but that's the fun part. the usb-c to usb-a I've used was the only one I've verified by flashing the pinephone for instance. others didn't work
21:45:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> I don't know why but that's surprising
21:45:25 <strcat> p1trson[m]: still could be broken
21:45:30 <strcat> p1trson[m]: or the USB port you were using is broken
21:45:35 <strcat> or the OS currently has some USB issue
21:45:51 <strcat> p1trson[m]: front desktop I/O panel USB ports usually broken as hell
21:46:04 <p1trson[m]> mm
21:46:06 <strcat> they usually have some really sketchy broken USB hub as part of the case
21:46:12 <strcat> dunno
21:46:14 <p1trson[m]> right now the phone is at```fastbootd
21:46:22 <strcat> p1trson[m]: yeah that's expected, just let it go
21:46:34 <p1trson[m]> ```extracting super_empty.img (0 MB) to disk... took 0.014s
21:46:34 <p1trson[m]> Rebooting into fastboot                            OKAY [  0.070s]
21:46:34 <p1trson[m]> < waiting for any device >
21:46:34 <strcat> should still be flashing then when it's done it reboots back to fastboot mode and then it's time to lock it
21:46:43 <strcat> p1trson[m]: it should wait then start again
21:46:53 <p1trson[m]> how long that should take?
21:47:03 <strcat> to reboot? a few seconds
21:47:10 <strcat> and then you just lock and it's done
21:47:46 <p1trson[m]> cheers for the support. I hope it goes fine ^^
21:49:01 <p1trson[m]> one advice - I'd put a note to the installation howto - if after starting flash-all nothing happens, it doesn't make sense to wait
21:49:18 <strcat> can do that
21:49:38 <strcat> for https://grapheneos.org/install/web it has sensible timeouts
21:50:22 <strcat> p1trson[m]: USB ecosystem is unfortunately just trash
21:50:25 <strcat> p1trson[m]: largely broken
21:50:27 <strcat> p1trson[m]: *shrug*
21:50:55 <snooopy> strcat: Oh, yeah, I love USB 3.2 Gen 2x2.
21:50:57 <strcat> and it's annoying that desktop Linux has the udev issue and that Windows needs a special driver
21:51:04 <p1trson[m]> yup heard about that. somehow I thought that this cable's gonna work. Since I had to try few to be able to flash PP too
21:51:17 <strcat> p1trson[m]: quite possible it's just the port rather than cable
21:51:22 <strcat> or OS issue
21:51:30 <strcat> it's hard to tell
21:51:37 <p1trson[m]> yup
21:53:41 <p1trson[m]> as soon as I set it up, I'll make sure to donate as well ;) I highly appreciate the whole effort put into grapheneOS
21:56:04 <p1trson[m]> offtopic - was pinephone ever considered as a target device?
21:57:31 <strcat> no, doesn't meet the privacy/security requirements, or functionality requirements
21:57:35 <strcat> can't be supported officially
21:57:51 <strcat> could make an unofficial build for it but it'll never pass CTS (missing functionality, particularly security functionality)
21:58:01 <strcat> and just isn't ever going to be suitable for official support
21:58:11 <p1trson[m]> what is missing in particular?
21:58:39 <strcat> verified boot, hardware keystores, hardware encryption support including secure element support, various SoC security features
21:58:54 <strcat> and we'd have to figure out how to ship all the firmware (assuming all components are supported and have it available)
21:59:16 <strcat> and we'd need to build a bootloader for it implementing A/B updates, etc.
21:59:31 <strcat> and there is no way to add the functionality that's missing in hardware/firmware particularly security stuff
21:59:59 <strcat> it probably doesn't have what's needed to really do proper A/B updates
22:00:42 <p1trson[m]> mm.. so back to installation
22:00:56 <strcat> p1trson[m]: https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400 is a small thread about future partnerships with hardware vendors
22:01:04 <p1trson[m]> the phone is still at fastbootd screen (grapheneOS fastboot)
22:01:09 <strcat> I don't think that vendor is interested in providing what would be needed
22:01:21 <p1trson[m]> (with options to reboot, enter recovery etc)
22:01:23 <strcat> p1trson[m]: it should just be immediately continuing to flash once it gets there unless USB conn dropped
22:01:37 <strcat> p1trson[m]: suggest trying again, ctrl-c flash-all, boot back to fastboot mode from there, try again
22:01:57 <strcat> try a different USB port
22:02:12 * p1trson[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SBwxLWRVcUIWhsgiJxqUckKZ/message.txt >
22:02:27 <p1trson[m]> but it's like that for more than 10 min with phone staying at fastbootd
22:02:38 <strcat> yeah it will just instantly continue normally
22:02:41 <strcat> no point waiting
22:02:43 <strcat> if it's not going
22:02:57 <strcat> the web installer would just say it timed out after a few seconds
22:03:18 <strcat> p1trson[m]: it's safe to cancel flashing at any point, it sends over data, then tells it to flash once the data is already sent
22:03:27 <strcat> p1trson[m]: sounds like you're still having USB issues
22:04:25 <strcat> should just try again, maybe diff usb port
22:04:54 <strcat> it's unusual to have issues when using the cable that comes with the phone though
22:05:02 <strcat> but still happens, usually not with a laptop though
22:05:20 <strcat> it wouldn't be the cable's fault tho
22:11:14 <HowardR> Working on building grapheneos how can I find out valid build and device strings?
22:11:15 <HowardR> The below probably means my build and device are wrong. I tried running
22:11:15 <HowardR> vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d redfin -b RQ1A -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor
22:11:16 <HowardR> from my grapheneos-RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.23.15 folder and got these error messages:
22:11:16 <HowardR> [-] URL not found
22:11:17 <HowardR> [-] Images download failed
22:11:32 <strcat[m]> p1trson: btw one thing you could do is that if it gets stuck after that reboot, unplug it and plug it back in
22:11:38 <p1trson[m]> hah
22:11:52 <strcat[m]> p1trson: guessing maybe a linux kernel bug
22:11:58 <p1trson[m]> using samsung cable connectedto my usb-c dock did the trick
22:12:11 <strcat[m]> p1trson: I think it's an OS issue rather than hw
22:12:16 <strcat[m]> some linux kernel bug on your laptop or w/e
22:12:29 <flawedworld[m]> <HowardR "from my grapheneos-RQ1A.210205.0"> RQ1A.210205.004 is the build number here. The rest are related to GrapheneOS.
22:12:37 <p1trson[m]> yup can be
22:13:26 <strcat> p1trson[m]: so yeah that should all go fine now then just lock -> optionally verify with Auditor after booting it up
22:13:43 <strcat> if it boots after it's locked that already tells you it's fully verified via verified boot so you know it flashed properly
22:14:06 <HowardR> <flawedworld[m]> OK, how can I find the build and device strings to use?
22:14:42 <strcat> HowardR: versions are structured like $BUILD_ID.$BUILD_NUMBER and we simply use the upstream AOSP $BUILD_ID to make it easy to tell the basis for the GrapheneOS version
22:15:17 <flawedworld[m]> <HowardR "<flawedworld[m]> OK, how can I f"> RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.26.16 you see here this tag for a release? you can see the AOSP build number here would be RQ1A.210205.004
22:15:23 <strcat> so for example the March release I'm working on has BUILD_ID RQ2A.210305.006 for the new AOSP release (Q2 means 2nd quarterly maintenance branch)
22:15:45 <p1trson[m]> seems it's booting! ^^
22:15:55 <p1trson[m]> yes will follow the rest of the docs
22:16:01 <strcat> p1trson[m]: if it shows the message that it's booting another OS means it's being verified properly
22:16:12 <p1trson[m]> yup it said that
22:16:18 <strcat> you'll just get a red error screen if there's any corruption, etc. so it's pretty easy to know it flashed properly
22:16:41 <HowardR> @strcat: I still don't understand where to get the build and device strings to use in calling execute-all.sh
22:16:55 <strcat> HowardR: RQ1A.210205.004 is $BUILD_ID
22:17:04 <strcat> device is just the codename of the device like sunfish for Pixel 4a
22:17:14 <strcat> if you're just building for the emulator / generic you skip that section
22:17:23 <strcat> generic builds don't have vendor files like firmware
22:18:09 <HowardR> It's doing something, thanks
22:18:27 <flawedworld[m]> <HowardR "@strcat: I still don't understan"> if you go here: https://developers.google.com/android/images you will see a list of device models and their respective models correlating to the codenames for Pixel devices.
22:18:44 <strcat> https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers
22:18:46 <strcat> there's also this
22:19:00 <strcat> https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds
22:19:31 <strcat[m]> but... they aren't marking stuff properly there
22:20:27 <strcat[m]> so, basically, carriers are horrifying, and you need these huge workaround config files with all the necessary carrier-specific workaround configuration
22:20:44 <strcat[m]> sometimes that stuff needs a change right before a release is going to go out, like a week before
22:20:58 <strcat[m]> and they prefer not rolling a new release to ship to everyone which would then be less tested
22:21:06 <strcat[m]> so instead they make these silly temporary carrier variants
22:21:22 <strcat[m]> and if you are using that carrier, they ship you the variant for that carrier instead, and it knows how to switch you over if you start using the carrier
22:21:36 <strcat[m]> it's just a dumb thing to deal with carriers while not violating their policy of testing releases for ages before release
22:21:46 <strcat[m]> it's the same OS
22:21:53 <strcat[m]> and you end up using the same release next month
22:22:04 <flawedworld[m]> This month the offending carrier was Virgin Media in the UK for the Pixel 5 for example
22:22:41 <strcat[m]> we just always use the generic release and ignore the carrier config bug fixes (gets rolled in next month anyway)
22:22:51 <p1trson[m]> so disabled OEM unlocking and the dev options. When booring it still says, that my device is loading different OS, that will stay there forever?
22:22:57 <strcat[m]> p1trson: yeah
22:23:05 <strcat[m]> p1trson: unless device was built to run GrapheneOS as stock OS basically
22:23:17 <strcat[m]> p1trson: and in that case, it would show it when not using official GrapheneOS release
22:23:20 <strcat[m]> it's just part of verified boot
22:23:31 <strcat[m]> using hard-wired OEM public key in bootloader -> no message
22:23:37 <strcat[m]> not verifying -> orange message
22:23:42 <strcat[m]> failure -> red (halts)
22:23:52 <strcat[m]> verifying via key in secure element -> yellow (i.e. custom OS)
22:24:17 <p1trson[m]> cheers 🙂
22:25:08 <strcat[m]> p1trson: https://us.codeaurora.org/quic/la/abl/tianocore/edk2/tree/QcomModulePkg/Include/Library/LEOEMCertificate.h?h=LA.UM.8.11.1.c1-01300-SA6125.0

22:30:51 <HowardR> Working on building grapheneos, I get this error message
22:30:51 <HowardR> ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google'

22:31:13 <strcat[m]> it's under the google namespace thus that error
22:31:50 <strcat[m]> google.protobuf
22:32:16 <strcat[m]> if we had our own hardware it'd be basically the same experience, it's just it would be green boot mode with official GrapheneOS release
22:33:43 <strcat[m]> pretty much all the same firmware, etc. though but we'd need a secure element from some other vendor + reimplementation of APIs that are used by AOSP
22:33:55 <p1trson[m]> I'm wasted, will continue tomorrow (adding apps from f-droid) tomorrow. looking forward to it!
22:34:05 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm has their SPU which some vendors are using
22:34:19 <strcat[m]> but I think it probably can't do Weaver (the thing we document in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption) yet
22:34:36 <strcat[m]> maybe they'll get that implemented and then we basically just need a Qualcomm SoC reference design phone
22:34:44 <p1trson[m]> 👋 and thanks again strcat
22:34:57 <strcat[m]> atm what makes it hard is that we'd need a secure element added on top of that with custom firmware
22:35:14 <strcat[m]> so, we can't just get a vendor that knows how to make a Qualcomm SoC phone to make a phone for us atm, we'd be missing some things
22:36:40 <strcat[m]> Pixels no longer have the visual / neural core since the SoC gained superior functionality so the main difference from just properly setup secure Qualcomm SoC phone + nicely built hardware/components is the secure element (Titan M)
22:36:54 <strcat[m]> but Qualcomm is working on that, SPU exists, just missing some stuff
22:37:04 <strcat[m]> I think main thing it needs (if not already added, unsure) is a secure timer
22:37:34 <strcat[m]> TEE (TrustZone) is basically obsolete for 99% of use cases
22:37:39 <strcat[m]> it sucks
22:37:50 <strcat[m]> it's a stupid design
22:38:30 <strcat[m]> it's still used for the legacy hardware keystore because the new API drops most cruft (doesn't have huge amount of ciphers, etc.)
22:39:12 <strcat[m]> and they still use it for DRM (widevine, etc.) but Google wants to purge all that stuff and just run that in a virtual machine and the OS in a 2nd VM to avoid using TrustZone because it sucks
22:39:21 <HowardR> Working on building grapheneos, installed python3-protobuf and now I get:
22:39:22 <HowardR> :
22:39:22 <HowardR> ** Resuming transfer from byte position 1586941083

22:39:25 <HowardR> vendor/android-prepare-vendor/execute-all.sh -d sunfish -b RQ1A.210205.004 -o vendor/android-prepare-vendor
22:39:49 <strcat[m]> and they don't actually care if DRM is secure anyway, the media companies just have to feel it is, so it's not worthy of being put on a secure element or anything
22:39:59 <flawedworld[m]> <HowardR "curl: (92) HTTP/2 stream 0 was n"> see: https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Maintainers/Common-Problems.md
22:42:32 <strcat[m]> secure element is a totally isolated thing with a minimal protocol for communication back and forth, secure storage, minimal attack surface, etc.
22:42:43 <strcat[m]> TEE (TrustZone, for ARM) is basically a CPU execution mode
22:43:07 <strcat[m]> so it's on the same CPU, but the CPU puts more effort into isolating it than simply process separation
22:43:50 <strcat[m]> and as the name implies (perhaps unintentionally), it's not really isolated but rather trusted
22:43:58 <strcat[m]> the phone vendor gets to choose what code to put in there (applets)
22:44:14 <strcat[m]> so there's a standard keymaster applet (for the hardware keystore), a widevine one, and that's most of it
22:44:27 <strcat[m]> Samsung has some weird supervisor thing to monitor the OS kernel and try to detect exploitation
22:45:05 <strcat> anyway it's just a bad idea, it doesn't even have storage itself
22:45:08 <strcat> the way storage works
22:45:15 <flawedworld[m]> <strcat[m] "Samsung has some weird superviso"> https://www.samsungknox.com/en/blog/real-time-kernel-protection-rkp
22:45:19 <strcat> TrustZone encrypts stuff with a key only available to itself
22:45:25 <strcat> and then gives the encrypted data to the OS to store
22:45:41 <strcat> that's what qseecomd mostly does for Qualcomm's TEE implementation (QSEE)
22:46:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​roupAnonymousBot> @clannad can you disable the anonymous thing here too?
22:46:08 <strcat> vs. the secure element with internal storage it can just directly reliably erase, etc.
22:47:01 <strcat> so the newer StrongBox keystore has 3 main advantages: much better isolation (from side channels, etc.), much lower attack surface and secure storage
22:47:21 <strcat> and Pixels also have advantage of a secure timer which is used for Weaver (separate API used by the OS which we document in our FAQ since it's pretty important)
23:19:26 <lumpenqueer[m]> Does graphene us a lot of background power?
23:19:26 <lumpenqueer[m]> My phone loses power hella fast, even when I'm not using it
23:22:00 <rny> lumpenqueer[m]: better question to ask "do the apps i install use a lot of power in background?"
23:22:07 <rny> the OS itself is very minimal
23:23:09 <strcat[m]> lumpenqueer: nope, definitely doesn't
23:24:23 <strcat[m]> way better battery life than stock OS, once you have something like Signal with fairly unoptimized push (they don't really care about making it good for non-FCM) then that makes it pretty much even though
23:24:24 <strcat[m]> if you install something really unoptimized and particularly if you give it a battery optimization exception then that's probably your issue
23:24:47 <strcat[m]> a lot of apps are really lazy with non-FCM push or don't bother with push at all and poll
23:25:46 <lumpenqueer[m]> Fcm?
23:26:36 <rny> firebase cloud messaging
23:28:30 <lumpenqueer[m]> My biggest battery users are signal and vanadium? Is that normal?
23:29:06 <lumpenqueer[m]> Like if I leave my phone alone at night, it pretty reliably loses around 20% overnight
23:31:44 <lumpenqueer[m]> Also does battery optimization affect it at all?
23:33:42 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: Signal is waking up the device at an interval to ping the connection to keeps open for push
23:33:56 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: and as I said, they have not been particularly keen on making an optimized implementation
23:34:19 <lumpenqueer[m]> F
23:34:33 <lumpenqueer[m]> Ty
23:34:47 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: the battery optimization exception allows it to bypass the phone being in deep sleep
23:35:07 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: essentially, the issue is that the Signal devs are not particularly interested in optimizing it much
23:35:14 <strcat> they don't care much about non-Play-services experience
23:35:22 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: it does use proper push
23:36:12 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: what they *should* do is have a system that gradually slows the rate it checks, and keep track of whether the connection died, and have it automatically end up using a longer interval between pings
23:36:17 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: especially when there's IPv6
23:36:25 <strcat> since the main issues breaking connections are IPv4 issues
23:36:34 <strcat> and it can also listen for network change events from their service to handle that
23:37:16 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: a fork like Molly could do it but ideally it'd end up upstream
23:37:27 <strcat> they just aren't very fond of even supporting non-Play-services at all
23:37:29 <strcat> so...
23:37:41 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: they still do better than most app devs :\
23:37:53 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: most don't want to bother implementing push if they can't just use FCM / APNS
23:38:33 <lumpenqueer[m]> Yeah figures
23:39:19 <lumpenqueer[m]> I feel like signal as an app is more likely to have edge case users than others, but it does make some sense why they focus on mass userbases
23:39:57 <strcat> I think what's needed overall is a library + demo app using it demonstrating a proper push impl
23:39:59 <strcat> without FCM
23:40:04 <strcat> MIT licensed
23:40:40 <strcat> and then point devs at that and get thousands of people to leave them 1 star reviews which they say they'll update to 5 stars if they fix their lack of non-FCM push in the review text
23:40:42 <strcat> lol...
23:40:43 <lumpenqueer[m]> Demo app?
23:40:57 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: I mean making a library demonstrating how to do this right + a sample app using it
23:41:08 <strcat> and have it permissively licensed so anyone (including proprietary app devs) can use it
23:41:24 <strcat> Signal is harder to deal with than simply making it better
23:41:27 <strcat> because you have to deal with moxie
23:41:33 <lumpenqueer[m]> U wanna review bomb signal?
23:41:45 <strcat> nah talking about apps without non-FCM push at all
23:41:46 <flowmast3r> hello.  can I make graphene os work with an old Samsung J3 Prime?
23:42:00 <strcat> and hey it's not review bombing
23:42:03 <strcat> it's legitimately pissed off users
23:42:05 <strcat> lol
23:42:14 <strcat> flowmast3r: not proper GrapheneOS
23:42:19 <lumpenqueer[m]> Its totally review bombing
23:42:39 <lumpenqueer[m]> I think more important would be non phone number identifiers
23:44:04 <lumpenqueer[m]> The potential for out of band harrasment enabled by inherent access to pii is so much more of an issue than excessive battery usage it not even a comparison
23:44:18 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: if you take away Signal's battery optimization exception or set it to battery saver mode overnight that would fix the issue for you
23:44:23 <strcat> battery saver will override it, I think
23:44:38 <strcat> so basically turn on battery saver when you go to sleep and just realize you won't get urgent signal calls/messages
23:45:01 <strcat> you would still get a traditional call (maybe not an SMS?)
23:45:09 <lumpenqueer[m]> <strcat "lumpenqueer: if you take away Si"> Will battery optimization affect functionality?
23:45:15 <flowmast3r> strcat: is there a version of graphene that would work with a J3?
23:45:22 <strcat> flowmast3r: no
23:45:47 <lumpenqueer[m]> <strcat "so basically turn on battery sav"> Fuck
23:45:56 <strcat> lumpenqueer[m]: no battery optimization exception -> device will go into deep sleep when idle (like when you're asleep) and won't care what Signal wants
23:46:06 <rny> dont people leave their phone to charge when they sleep?
23:46:23 <strcat> well just buy one of those Pixel stands or another wireless charger
23:46:27 <strcat> and put your phone on that when you go to sleep
23:46:28 <rny> better idea: just turn off your phone when you sleep
23:46:42 <strcat> I have a Pixel stand
23:46:51 <strcat> makes it into an alarm clock I can glance at and charges it
23:47:14 <strcat> I actually have 2, use one for fast charging phones without wearing out their USB ports (since I have 11 phones sitting here)
23:47:33 <mrbeanz[m]> Hi all, I'm fairly new to the community and GOS, but I've been absolutely loving running it on my 4a.
23:47:33 <mrbeanz[m]> Question for the group - strictly from a security perspective, would it be better to run an unsupported pixel (like the pixel 2) on the last updated build of GrapheneOS, or with the current LineageOS? And then what would be the reason for your answer?
23:47:33 <mrbeanz[m]> Do old EOL pixels ever get a GOS update if a new vulnerability is found? If not it seems to me that LOS would be better as at least the software is maintained. I know they're both horrible, but I'm curious what the consensus is for which is worse.
23:47:34 <strcat> makes me mad that 3a, 4a and 4a (5G) don't have wireless charging
23:47:38 <flowmast3r> anything I can use to de-google the J3 prime?
23:47:57 <rny> mrbeanz[m]: #grapheneos-offtopic
23:47:57 <strcat> mrbeanz[m]: Pixel 2 is insecure regardless of what you run on it
23:48:14 <rny> and read https://grapheneos.org pls
23:48:21 <strcat> mrbeanz[m]: you can look at our site and see we're still doing extended support releases for it, but unlike others, we're not going to pretend it's secure or reasonable to use it
23:48:37 <strcat> so, don't use a Pixel 2
23:48:44 <rny> flowmast3r: #grapheneos-offtopic for unsupported devices
23:48:54 <strcat> I think we do a good job of not letting our continued ESR releases encourage people to keep using it which would be bad
23:49:01 <strcat> and we'll stop that soon since it's increasingly pointless
23:50:47 <mrbeanz[m]> Thanks for the info, my apologies for using the wrong chat. I read the site as well, but must have misunderstood.
23:50:47 <mrbeanz[m]> I acknowledged that pixel 2s are horribly insecure, but was just wondering from a "better of 2 evils" perspective.
23:51:32 <strcat> mrbeanz[m]: it increasingly doesn't matter, is basically my answer
23:51:53 <strcat> insecure either way
23:52:05 <strcat> too much stuff that's not maintained anymore
23:53:14 <NSA[m]1> What medicine should I take for a stomachache?
23:54:32 <NSA[m]1> Sorry
23:54:38 <rny> O_O
23:55:24 <NSA[m]1> That was for an online chat with a doctor
23:55:44 <strcat> sure
23:59:49 <Jack8> I was just wondering if anyone got the ebay app to work
23:59:58 <b1101> Jack8: tried. nope
