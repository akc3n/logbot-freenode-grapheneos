01:41:04 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: we may have to ask the Freenode operators to put our channel in "long ban list" mode.

01:57:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: what's that

02:31:56 <johnnick2[m]> is send private number
02:32:13 <johnnick2[m]> i dont¬¥ know if i can see the number in anyway
02:32:16 <phonehome[m]> i'm sure it's okay, i'm not a staffer.  would probably be good for all to block. and have visual proof.
02:32:26 <johnnick2[m]>  * i dont¬¥ know if i can see the number in any way
02:32:38 <johnnick2[m]> <phonehome[m] "i'm sure it's okay, i'm not a st"> will do
02:35:51 <youknow313[m]> <johnnick2[m] "can i share image on here?"> this is the wrong chat, go to CopperheadOS forums for real support
02:36:27 <youknow313[m]> stop it
02:40:01 <mite1313[m]>  i wll join again again everyday for now
02:41:42 <take_a_deep_brea> lmfao
02:41:57 <phonehome[m]> <mite1313[m] " i wll join again again everyday"> yes me too.  every day i will join.  because i too am lonely
02:42:16 <timeo[m]> I think you should block new users
02:42:25 <timeo[m]> For now
02:42:30 <phonehome[m]> <timeo[m] "I think you should block new use"> then it becomes echo chamber
02:42:37 <take_a_deep_brea> this is growing old and tiresome
02:42:57 <take_a_deep_brea> dont they have anything better to do ?
02:42:58 <grapheneos_user_> @room don't feed the trolls, just focus on your own problems and support and don't pay attention to the trolls. Let them make fools of themselves.
02:43:02 <timeo[m]> <phonehome[m] "then it becomes echo chamber"> Yeah, but they will join again..
02:43:24 <phonehome[m]> <timeo[m] "Yeah, but they will join again.."> it's why we have staffers/mods
02:43:34 <grapheneos_user_> "Never argue with idiots. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience". Apply this to trolls too.
02:43:50 <phonehome[m]> eventually they will go away.
02:44:07 <take_a_deep_brea> [i may be phoning home soon]:  its a really time consuming job.  they have better things to do .
02:44:17 <grapheneos_user_> <phonehome[m] "eventually they will go away."> Press X to doubt
02:44:32 <phonehome[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "[i may be phoning home soon]:  i"> well if they need a hand eventually many of us will swing the mighty ban hammer
02:44:39 <timeo[m]> Im trying to ignore them but is so annoying
02:44:46 <grapheneos_user_> This is why you just shouldn't pay attention to them. You're playing into what they want by talking about them.
02:45:19 <grapheneos_user_> They want you to think of it, to break your concentration. The way you can win is by refusing to succumb to that.
02:45:46 <phonehome[m]> kicks goodmeant3131
02:45:51 <goodment3131[m]> ??
02:45:56 <grapheneos_user_> Let's see if you all have learnt something from what I have said.
02:45:58 <goodment3131[m]> what did i do?
02:46:35 <phonehome[m]> was just testing out regex banhammer, disregard
02:46:35 <goodment3131[m]> i about too ask something with bug on grapheneos
02:47:13 <grapheneos_user_> goodment3131: There have been lots of Copperhead trolls spamming gore in the chat, with similar number suffixes as your username.
02:47:26 <phonehome[m]> what sort of bug ? goodment3131
02:47:29 <goodment3131[m]> oh sorry for hearing that
02:47:33 <goodment3131[m]> anyway
02:47:55 <goodment3131[m]> with notication
02:48:07 <goodment3131[m]> when i change too white theme
02:48:18 <goodment3131[m]> the notations are still black
02:48:50 <goodment3131[m]>  * the notifications are still black
02:48:56 <goodment3131[m]>  * with notification
02:49:24 <goodment3131[m]>  * the notifications are still in dark theme
02:49:40 <phonehome[m]> is it specific app?  if so perhaps the app is not respecting the system theming
02:50:02 <goodment3131[m]> is a system app
02:50:18 <goodment3131[m]> like quick settings
02:50:52 * goodment3131[m] uploaded an image: image.png (243KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/CXEJaCvmcDWbycdhXADiUCml/image.png >
02:50:55 <goodment3131[m]> like that
02:51:54 <goodment3131[m]> this panel stay black even i enable white theme
02:51:55 <goodment3131[m]>  * this panel stay black even when i enable white theme
02:53:07 <phonehome[m]> what build are you on, what phone? someone may be able to reproduce it.  if not likely a good idea to file an issue
02:53:15 <zzxx123> prove you are on white theme
02:53:42 <goodment3131[m]> pixel 5, running feb build
02:54:04 <phonehome[m]> i don't have a 5 otherwise i'd try to replicate.
02:54:06 <goodment3131[m]> <zzxx123 "prove you are on white theme"> oke 1 sec
02:54:10 <grapheneos_user_> <goodment3131[m] "this panel stay black even i ena"> I think that happens on stock Android too.
02:54:17 <grapheneos_user_> Maybe I'm wrong tho, let me check
02:54:22 <matie1313[m]> hey guys

02:57:04 <goodment3131[m]> and give fake infotmation
02:57:44 <nicole> rny: TheJollyRoger already poked about it, i suspect ideally you'll want to talk to them later to catch up but the tl;dr is that you shouldn't need it just yet ‚Äì we'd be happy to enable it once it's needed, though
02:57:53 <grapheneos_user_> <phonehome[m] "grapheneos_user_pi: `2$ cash`"> Well...you beautiful bastard, you win
02:57:59 <TheJollyRoger> Aye, nicole!
02:59:21 <nicole> for now i'd say focus on dealing with the ongoing abuse, and do feel free to poke me if you run into issues
03:00:17 <grapheneos_user_> p0tat0: xxfer23xx You 2 joined just after someone was banned
03:00:50 <grapheneos_user_> xmane1313: You are a Copperhead troll.

03:05:47 <phonehome[m]> <timeo[m] "This feels like a war"> pretty fucking sparta in here today mate.
03:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> Think they've been removed from the channel.
03:06:16 <grapheneos_user_> We should let them spam gore, and simply remind the @room not to feed their delusions
03:06:28 <phonehome[m]> ^
03:06:47 <grapheneos_user_> mikemer: Who are you
03:06:55 <mikemer[m]> i think i found a issue with the settings apk
03:06:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hey rny, I'm just banning the wildcard after *

03:07:10 <grapheneos_user_> rny: ok sorry
03:07:11 <rny> please mind your own business
03:07:11 <phonehome[m]> we should make shirts:  `grapheneos:  i will join again!`
03:07:24 <grapheneos_user_> I willrny:
03:07:28 <mikemer[m]> let me explain what i mean
03:07:57 <phonehome[m]> <phonehome[m] "we should make shirts:  `graphen"> back in a sec, going to printful
03:08:25 <mikemer[m]> so, after i installed the os, i miss the copperheados logo, oh wait you guys are fake
03:09:38 <phonehome[m]> i miss the old cocacola logo
03:09:39 <nicole> TheJollyRoger: (banned that one from the network, can skip banning them i think)
03:10:11 <timeo[m]> They might use tor for this
03:10:25 <TheJollyRoger> nicole: Oh whew, thank you.
03:10:28 <nicole> TheJollyRoger: missed the /shell/ in the removal
03:10:31 <timeo[m]> Not sure tho
03:10:33 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops!
03:10:42 <TheJollyRoger> Think I fixed it XP.
03:10:46 <phonehome[m]> <timeo[m] "They might use tor for this"> i knew running 60 exits was bad for something.
03:15:46 <ladys3[m]> https://copperhead.co/ is real
03:15:49 <ladys3[m]> https://copperhead.co/ is real
03:15:50 <ladys3[m]> https://copperhead.co/ is real
03:15:51 <ladys3[m]> https://copperhead.co/ is real
03:17:14 <rny> does the +m flag propogate to matrix?
03:17:20 <TheJollyRoger> I think so.
03:18:01 <louipx> yea but no one can chat then
03:18:05 <rny> PSA: the channel has been put into invite-only mode due to abuse.
03:18:10 <jellyer[m]> dont feed the troll
03:18:44 <jellyer[m]> sorry if your guys are buzy with other things
03:18:49 <rny> there is a zero-tolerance/zero-warning policy on kickbans that will apply for busy-bodying, and any trivial rule violations.
03:19:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hey rny, it looks like the number after the x-* on Matrix is their session number, which regenerates periodically.
03:19:56 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to start using that from now on.
03:20:03 <louipcm> test
03:20:27 <TheJollyRoger> Er, I mean, I'm going to start replacing the session number with a *
03:20:42 <xx> 06:18 -!- cmode      +S     - This ensures only users that have connected via TLS/SSL (and
03:20:45 <xx> 06:18 -!- cmode               so have user mode +Z) are able to join; you can not /invite
03:20:48 <xx> 06:18 -!- cmode               them through it. It will not prevent the use of the channel
03:20:51 <xx> 06:18 -!- cmode               by any non-TLS/SSL users already present.
03:22:00 <louipx> could do registered only mode
03:22:09 <rny> louipx: blocks matrix iirc
03:22:22 <louipx> most matrix users won't bother to register on freenode
03:22:33 <louipx> yea all the spams coming from matrix
03:23:34 <timeo[m]> <louipx "most matrix users won't bother t"> Was freenode?
03:24:24 <louipx> timeo[m]: its the original IRC chat that this is linked to in matrix
03:24:32 <timeo[m]> Oh
03:25:02 <xx> I'm connecting thru irssi.
03:45:07 <methodman[m]1> To all the mods and helpers in this room THANK YOU!
03:45:35 <methodman[m]1> After going through 1000+ messages and seeing all the bans I can see it is a full time job
03:48:43 <grapheneos_user_> :)
03:50:40 <grapheneos_user_> almost 5 hours of trolling...is that a new record?
03:50:55 <timeo[m]> I think so

03:51:57 <somenerd[m]> yeah, should be fine
03:52:22 <somenerd[m]> just note that, if it worked (which it doesn't), you'd ping like 600-800 people
03:52:31 <grapheneos_user_> Lol
03:52:40 <somenerd[m]>  * just note that, if it worked (which it doesn't), you'd ping like 1100 people

03:53:43 <grapheneos_user_> Lmao
03:53:54 <grapheneos_user_> Even making the room invite-only isn't enough
03:54:15 <timeo[m]> He was talking about copperhead

03:57:51 <take_a_deep_brea> regardless of how we feel , abusive talk only feeds this kind of behaviour .
03:58:14 <somenerd[m]> yeah, it becomes us doing basically the same thing as them
03:58:33 <somenerd[m]> > methodman: Yarr, that be what I be here for, shipmate.
03:58:33 <somenerd[m]> yeah, thanks for moderating that mess
03:58:39 <phonehome[m]> you're right.  let's be the bigger people.  otherwise jolly may have to get the long sword
03:59:00 <methodman[m]1> It is very hard not to get frustrated with the spammers! But we have to rise above

04:00:52 <phonehome[m]> <timeo[m] "Where can i buy one lol"> i'll probably just make one for myself as a memory of this day.
04:01:18 <timeo[m]> We need one as well
04:01:32 <phonehome[m]> i need to ask permission to use the gos logo
04:02:02 <phonehome[m]> i didn't ask the n.s.a when i used theirs.  but i respect gos.
04:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> I once made a GrapheneOS shirt. I might do another, someday, but I don't know when.
04:03:25 <nrt[m]> How does one register for freenode? And is that a solution to stop trolls/spam?
04:03:29 <phonehome[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I once made a GrapheneOS shirt. "> do i require permission to use the logo?  can i send some buckaroos to someone?
04:03:29 <TheJollyRoger> I would really love to make a GrapheneOS hockey jersey or a baseball jersey.
04:03:40 <timeo[m]> <phonehome[m] "i need to ask permission to use "> I understand but it still will be cool
04:04:05 <phonehome[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I would really love to make a Gr"> i have a baseball jersey designed and a baseball cap. i do that when i cannot find swag for project i swoon over
04:04:39 <TheJollyRoger> phonehome[m]: I think you're in the clear to use it for your own use.

04:04:48 <somenerd[m]> A GrapheneOS sponsored team?
04:04:55 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: oh, haha, well...
04:05:22 <TheJollyRoger> I just like baseball jerseys and hockey jerseys because they often are built to last, they look good, and they also tend to be very durable.
04:05:43 <phonehome[m]> i'm a bit baseball cap obsessed
04:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> But you should never wear a hockey jersey without something underneath it, or it will itch like crazy because they aren't meant for that.
04:06:38 <phonehome[m]> ^wisdom
04:10:13 <louipc> ok try to get back to normal. keep the chat on topic. other topics can go to #grapheneos-offtopic. thanks
04:13:58 <timeo[m]> I feel bad for the users who needs real help.
05:03:41 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <Publius "Copperhead sucks donkey ballz"> Do not engage in trolling as well, despite them being a spammer or troll
05:51:16 <timeo[m]> Does Grapheneos logo has any story behind it or is it just a random design?
05:51:40 <timeo[m]> Wrong place
05:51:57 <timeo[m]> * Wrong place my bad
05:52:08 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  its a stylised view of a schematic diagram how graphene looks
05:52:14 <take_a_deep_brea>  * timeo:  its a stylised view of a schematic diagram of how graphene looks
05:53:17 <somenerd[m]> yeah I believe it's just a design looking like the element graphene
05:53:32 <take_a_deep_brea> graphene is nothing but Carbon
05:54:25 <timeo[m]> Yeah, i just look it up
05:55:20 <timeo[m]> Didnt know that graphene was a thing
05:55:58 <timeo[m]> I was more thinking of graphene as  aname
05:56:15 <timeo[m]> * I was more thinking of graphene as a name
05:56:21 <TheLoneWanderer[> chromium is an element
05:56:25 <TheLoneWanderer[> same for vanadium

Is there a solution to this or another way to verify the images before I install them?
06:12:44 <rny> SRC: please use the web installer.
06:13:13 <rny> SRC: there's probably a path issue.
06:13:25 <SRC> Does the web installer automatically verify the images before flashing?
06:14:50 <rny> SRC: it doesnt need to since the image is from the same source destination
06:15:43 <rny> and your session is protected by TLS
06:16:07 <SRC> Thanks. One more question, Qubes OS technically runs Debian in a virtual machine. I saw something about this not being recommended. Do I have to use a different OS?
06:16:17 <somenerd[m]> > Mhm again
06:16:17 <somenerd[m]> Again? Wow they're spamming so many times
06:16:21 <SRC> To install
06:16:32 <rny> SRC: just install chromium to use the web installer
06:16:33 <somenerd[m]> VM passthrough is unreliable
06:16:42 <somenerd[m]> it can work though
06:16:59 <somenerd[m]> so just use Chromium to install
06:17:29 <SRC> I use Brave browser or Firefox. This is my first attempt and I don't want to brick the brand new pixel I bought.
06:17:53 <somenerd[m]> Firefox isn't supported
06:18:33 <somenerd[m]> Chromium
06:18:33 <somenerd[m]> Google Chrome
06:18:33 <somenerd[m]> Microsoft Edge
06:18:35 <timeo[m]> <SRC "I use Brave browser or Firefox. "> Just use chrome for now
06:18:39 <somenerd[m]> these are the tested ones
06:18:46 <timeo[m]> Thats what i did
06:19:09 <somenerd[m]> (ones that are basically guaranteed to work)
06:19:31 <TheLoneWanderer[> <SRC "I am running Debian 10 on Qubes "> Probably forgot to alias signify
06:20:24 <timeo[m]> Second firefox doesn't work with web install
06:24:56 <SRC> Can I back up the pixel 3 somehow in just in case I need to revert it back to stock?
06:27:40 <rny> SRC: when you flash, device gets wiped
06:27:55 <rny> and yes, you can always revert bakc to stock
07:30:28 <dannyknoll3[m]> <SRC "Can I back up the pixel 3 someho"> Stock images are readily available
07:30:37 <nix465[m]> If I take an image on grapheneOS does it remove exif data ?
07:36:06 <Thatcher[m]> <nix465[m] "If I take an image on grapheneOS"> No
07:36:59 <Thatcher[m]> If you want to remove exif, process an image through an app like Scrambled Eggsif
07:37:24 <Thatcher[m]> Scrambled Exif*
07:38:10 <Thatcher[m]> Sending images through apps like Signal or Threema will remove exif data for the recipient
07:38:47 <Thatcher[m]> But Exif is retained if you send as a file
07:41:37 <take_a_deep_brea> <Thatcher[m] "If you want to remove exif, proc"> lmao
07:42:04 <Thatcher[m]> Did I give bad advice?
07:42:26 <take_a_deep_brea> nah the pun kinda grew on you , didnt it ?
07:42:28 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
07:42:41 <take_a_deep_brea>  * nah, the pun kinda grew on you , didnt it ?
07:42:52 <Thatcher[m]> Haha
07:42:56 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
07:48:10 <take_a_deep_brea> nix465:  grapheneOS does not micro-manage user data to improve user privacy . GrapheneOS is about developing system level hardening that makes actual, sustainable improvements to device security while making sure user experience is not hampered . I am sure exif data exists because it has certain use cases . so it would be a bad design decision if somehow exif data was discarded without user explicitly intending
07:48:10 <take_a_deep_brea> to do so .
07:53:11 <Thatcher[m]> I prefer exif data in my photos, just not when the photos end up escaping the custody of the person I sent them to
07:54:52 <take_a_deep_brea> So please take this into consideration before proposing a feature or whatever . Also the os issue tracker is a good source for understanding the matters taken into consideration before a feature is implemented  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/

08:09:36 <dar_gomml[m]> <Thatcher[m] "I prefer exif data in my photos,"> i can recommend scrambeledexif and imagepip apps in fdroid store for that purpose
08:10:11 <dar_gomml[m]> * i can recommend scrambeledexif and imagepipe apps in fdroid store for that purpose

09:35:01 <came2complain[m]> Good morning, I have a question in regards to deletion of files on grapheneOS
09:35:20 <came2complain[m]> is it possible to automatically overwrite the freed up space when deleting a file with grapheneOS?"
09:35:21 <came2complain[m]>  * is it possible to automatically overwrite the freed up space when deleting a file with grapheneOS?
09:35:28 <came2complain[m]> in order to have some secure file deletion?
09:35:54 <TheLoneWanderer[> Files are encrypted by default
09:35:58 <came2complain[m]> yes
09:36:11 <came2complain[m]> but I might be forced to give away the password at one point
09:36:34 <came2complain[m]> so it's better when there is no recoverable files on my device
09:37:09 <came2complain[m]> my wife can be very threatening when she believes there are nudes of the competition on my phone :D
09:37:36 <came2complain[m]> not to mention the Chinese and US border police
09:38:30 <TheLoneWanderer[> I don't think you can securely erase a file when considering ssds
09:38:58 <TheLoneWanderer[> Better wait for strcat
09:39:07 <take_a_deep_brea> came2complain:  please carry on this discussion #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
09:39:35 <take_a_deep_brea> discussion about threat models is best done over there
09:39:58 <came2complain[m]> I don't want to discuss the threat model I just want to know how secure data deletion is on grapheneOS
09:40:01 <came2complain[m]> but thx for the hint
09:41:29 <take_a_deep_brea> came2complain:  recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
09:52:50 <strcat[m]> came2complain: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
09:53:09 <strcat[m]> came2complain: overwriting files with data does NOT reliably delete their content with any modern HDD or SSD
09:53:45 <strcat[m]> came2complain: on the other hand, due to the hardware encryption support, you can reliably delete user profiles or factory reset the device
09:54:06 <strcat[m]> came2complain: and hardware keystore keys in the HSM can be reliably deleted, so data encrypted with those can be deleted reliably by deleting the key for recovering it
09:54:50 <strcat[m]> came2complain: the hardware keystore is the primary keystore API exposed to apps for managing keys and they're free to expose functionality using them or to use it under the hood
09:55:12 <strcat[m]> it's all covered well in that section of our guide
09:55:26 <came2complain[m]> ok
09:56:19 <take_a_deep_brea> uhoh
10:36:43 <user51[m]> Running GrapheneOS on a Pixel3a
10:37:05 <user51[m]> Seedvault  backup is available for the standard profile, but not the work profile
10:37:17 <user51[m]> do you know how to enable Seedvault for the work profile
10:51:38 <strcat[m]> user51: it would have to be implemented by them
10:52:05 <strcat[m]> also our general recommendation is to use user profiles as isolated workspaces but it's not related to this and Seedvault doesn't have support for backing those up yet either
10:53:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> user51: go to backup settings
10:53:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Select your work profile
10:53:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Does that not work?
10:54:02 <user51[m]> <strcat[m] "also our general recommendation "> so "them"=Seedvault or "them"=GrapheneOS?
10:54:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> user51: seedvault
10:54:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway
10:54:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try what I've said
10:54:33 <user51[m]> i have
10:54:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it doesn't work we can make a bug report upstream
10:54:39 <user51[m]> it says "Not available"
10:55:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> user51: what is the work profile manager?
10:55:40 <user51[m]> Shelter
10:57:19 <user51[m]> <strcat[m] "also our general recommendation "> i a m using the work profile to prevent certain apps from accessing all my contacts - ofc its always a tradeoff between security and convenience...
10:58:21 <somenerd[m]> you can use user profiles for the same purpose
10:59:15 <strcat[m]> user51: our recommendation is to use user profiles, and you could also consider not giving those apps the contacts permission
10:59:36 <strcat[m]> user51: by using a work profile you're trusting a device admin app with whatever device admins privileges it asked for along with managing the work profile
11:03:24 <user51[m]> <strcat[m] "user51: by using a work profile "> i dont have any device admin app on my phone. Just Shelter to manage the work profile. Yes, user profile would be more secure, but i need to receive notifications from apps in the profile
11:03:36 <user51[m]> dont know if that is possible with a user profile
11:04:31 <user51[m]> <strcat[m] "user51: by using a work profile "> would be nice to be able to give access to some contacts, but not all of them.
11:07:04 <strcat[m]> user51: that's fully supported
11:07:21 <strcat[m]> user51: the app is choosing to demand access to all contacts instead of using case-by-case access
11:08:08 <strcat[m]> user51: https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/activity/result/contract/ActivityResultContracts.PickContact
11:08:38 <strcat[m]> an app can use this when you press a button to send a message to someone new
11:08:43 <strcat[m]> and you choose the contact
11:08:57 <strcat[m]> and it never needs Contacts perm
11:09:07 <strcat[m]> they choose to demand bulk access, and you choose to give them it and tolerate it as many users do
11:11:43 <user51[m]> yes they do, thats why i install them to my work profile...
11:12:15 <user51[m]> it has an extra phone book with just the bare minimum of contacts
11:48:10 <Citizen528[m]> Can grapheneos still run some apps from the Google play store via aurora store/yalp store?
11:48:26 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <Citizen528[m] "Can grapheneos still run some ap"> Yes, some
11:51:46 <Citizen528[m]> Honestly all I would want is Google maps. I try to use my car GPS for everything but sometimes if I'm in a pinch I like to pull that up, although I suppose I could use it via web browser right?
11:53:26 <Citizen528[m]> Looks like I can just use it in browser. Can't navigate but I don't care about that.
11:53:54 <strcat[m]> Google Maps app also largely works on GrapheneOS anyway
11:54:00 <strcat[m]> but yeah you can use OSM-based map apps instead
11:54:03 <strcat[m]> or use Google Maps in a browser
11:54:30 <strcat[m]> most Google apps have a hard dependency on Play services but a few don't
11:54:39 <strcat[m]> they don't try to provide full functionality without it at all though
11:55:01 <strcat[m]> and of course their advertising library is one of the things they made sure to make work without needing Play services
11:55:23 <somenerd[m]> > and of course their advertising library is one of the things they made sure to make work without needing Play services
11:55:23 <somenerd[m]> lol
11:55:24 <strcat[m]> it has a lite version that depends on Play and a bigger one that doesn't
12:09:01 <vinodp[m]> i use OSM.
12:14:26 <huehuelmao[m]> If i observed correctly this is the platform to ask questions. What apps are bundled by default with graphene other than Vanadium, auditor and a default cam app?
12:34:56 <strcat[m]> huehuelmao: the user-facing apps are Auditor, Calculator, Calendar, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Files, Gallery, Messaging, PDF Viewer, Phone, Settings, Vanadium
12:35:13 <strcat[m]> Calendar is just a sample app, not useful
12:36:28 <strcat[m]> Music and QuickSearchBox are kinda user-facing, QuickSearchBox is just a sample app
12:37:10 <strcat[m]> huehuelmao: the OS itself is composed of a lot of components built out of apps but I don't think you're asking about that
12:37:37 <strcat[m]> they aren't user-facing apps

13:32:56 <[phonehome][m]> will do
13:32:57 <strcat[m]> don't use sockpuppets, don't use bots, don't spam, don't bother people about it
13:33:03 <strcat[m]> don't post it places it isn't relevant
13:33:05 <timeo[m]> "Unfortunately due to widespread violation of our license and expanding resource requirements, CopperheadOS became a paid product" lol
13:33:08 <strcat[m]> don't bring it up when it's not the topic
13:33:21 <timeo[m]> Okie
13:34:04 <take_a_deep_brea> [phonehome]:  please go through what they accuse us of
13:34:13 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont want you to convice them
13:34:22 <take_a_deep_brea> but any rash behavior only feeds them
13:34:28 <strcat[m]> think they gave up on raiding the channel for now
13:34:34 <strcat[m]> that's how it works
13:34:42 <strcat[m]> they have to learn there are consequences for them
13:34:46 <strcat[m]> and then they'll stop hurting themselves
13:34:47 <[phonehome][m]> <take_a_deep_brea "but any rash behavior only feeds"> copy that.
13:34:51 <strcat[m]> the only thing that will stop them is self-interest
13:35:21 <strcat[m]> so when they do something like raiding the channel, we are going to inflict pain on them by spreading evidence showing their harassment, threats, misinformation campaign, etc.
13:35:25 <take_a_deep_brea> and btw not targeting you or anything, just saying
13:35:37 <strcat[m]> respond to them with facts
13:35:47 <strcat[m]> politely presenting facts and tearing down their lies
13:35:56 <strcat[m]> do not engage in their behavior
13:36:06 <strcat[m]> anyone doing that kind of thing is very likely one of their sockpuppets
13:36:11 <strcat[m]> because we always tell people not to do it
13:36:26 <strcat[m]> nope they haven't given up yet
13:36:44 <take_a_deep_brea> matrix lagging like shit for me
13:36:44 <strcat[m]> Copperhead is not above making sockpuppets pretending to be GrapheneOS users/supporters trying to make us look bad
13:36:55 <strcat[m]> in reality it only makes them look bad because it's obvious
13:36:56 <strcat[m]> and we have proof
13:37:25 <strcat[m]> if they start spamming stuff just ping me
13:40:48 <penpal[m]> Copperhead's CEO is the yandere dev of android developers, stealing code, harassing others who did actual work, and living in a never ending echo chamber
13:41:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> penpal: no
13:41:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Whatever yanderedev did is his problem
13:42:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't create more enemies here
13:42:25 <penpal[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Don't create more enemies here"> You're right, apologies
13:43:09 <penpal[m]> Just saw parallels that's all
13:44:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't think that guy raided other people's channels, sent legal threats to students threw trash off his balcony at other people or start a huge misinformation campaign
13:45:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> * I don't think that guy raided other people's channels, sent legal threats to students, threw trash off his balcony at other people or start a huge misinformation campaign

13:48:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> timeo: tag Daniel when you see one
13:48:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Already explained earlier
13:48:38 <penpal[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Avoid spreading libel or slander"> Keeping that in mind from now on, I shouldn't have made that  comment.
13:49:24 <timeo[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "timeo: tag Daniel when you see o"> Anthing else? Or only that?
13:52:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Avoid replying to the trolls
13:52:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Best case they'll just ignore you. Worst case you'll say something that makes the whole community look bad
13:52:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat
13:52:46 <sundude[m]> Hey, i can really use some help
13:52:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> sundude: me too
13:53:00 <sundude[m]> With installing
13:53:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> CopperheadOS I know
13:53:16 <sundude[m]> ??
13:53:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> sundude: please see grapheneos.org/install
13:56:14 <timeo[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Avoid replying to the trolls"> you too lol
13:56:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Haha ok
14:00:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat another one
14:00:14 <somenerd[m]> wow what is happening here...
14:00:20 <take_a_deep_brea> wow
14:00:21 <timeo[m]> How do you know?
14:00:22 <somenerd[m]> everything has been removed
14:00:29 <take_a_deep_brea> look at the frickin name
14:00:32 <somenerd[m]> and so many copperhead things on freenode
14:00:32 <take_a_deep_brea> *nick
14:00:42 <timeo[m]> Oh i didnt see lol
14:00:49 <take_a_deep_brea> you think any sane person would do that lmfao
14:00:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: also that's like basically proof that James is directly involved in this attack
14:01:07 <strcat[m]> somenerd: they've been raiding the channels for 12 hours or something
14:01:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> He fucked up there
14:01:19 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: they've been raiding the channels for 12 hours or something
14:01:19 <somenerd[m]> yeah
14:01:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's a copy of madaidan's words
14:01:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Who other than James knows those lol
14:01:41 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
14:01:49 <somenerd[m]> everytime I come on, there's some or the other troll
14:01:54 <strcat[m]> please stop talking about it here
14:02:00 <strcat[m]> I will ban them when they come
14:02:03 <somenerd[m]> yeah will stop now
14:02:04 <strcat[m]> discussing of it is off-topic
14:02:15 <strcat[m]>  * discussion of it is off-topic
14:02:16 <somenerd[m]> not productive, and will basically make them succeed
14:02:32 <strcat[m]> they have earned 5 more posts of evidence on Reddit today
14:02:37 <strcat[m]> on both subreddits
14:02:41 <strcat[m]> + linking them here and on Twitter
14:02:49 <strcat[m]>  * + linking them here and on Twitter
14:03:00 <strcat[m]> if they don't leave us completely alone tomorrow, same thing
14:05:12 <strcat[m]> any attack they make on us will be met with a far more successful evidence-based response
14:05:24 <strcat[m]> they have had almost 3 years to learn this and have not yet learned
14:05:40 <strcat[m]> I hope that soon, they will finally learn that they should leave us alone and drop their attacks
14:05:52 <timeo[m]> One day they will learn, i hope lol
14:06:24 <strcat[m]> they are going to lose in court, they are going to lose on social media, and obviously they have nothing to offer of any value when it comes to technical merit
14:07:16 <strcat[m]> they just get more and more desperate
14:07:17 <timeo[m]> This just so sad
14:07:18 <timeo[m]> To do
14:07:19 <strcat[m]> look at their CEO trying to get that security researcher fired for sending them a single message with single character: a middle finger emoji
14:07:19 <strcat[m]> James is unhinged and delusional
14:07:49 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/lppfre/archive_of_copperhead_ceo_trying_to_get_ian/
14:07:50 <strcat[m]> this is completely unhinged
14:07:50 <timeo[m]> <strcat[m] "they are going to lose in court,"> When is that
14:07:52 <strcat[m]> this is what we are dealing with
14:07:53 <strcat[m]> people who spend their time repeatedly making Matrix accounts to spam
14:07:54 <grapheneos_user_> Imagine being so petty
14:07:57 <grapheneos_user_> James I mean
14:08:12 <grapheneos_user_> But it's off-topic
14:09:49 <timeo[m]> Mhm other one?
14:10:01 <strcat[m]> doesn't look like it
14:10:05 <somenerd[m]> nah
14:10:09 <somenerd[m]> probs not
14:10:14 <strcat[m]> let me deal with it
14:14:21 <timeo[m]> <strcat[m] "let me deal with it"> Your doing a good job, so a üëçfor you :)
14:14:28 <m_b_[m]> how does Copperhead have no negative reviews on the BBB
14:14:28 <m_b_[m]> https://www.bbb.org/ca/on/toronto/profile/security-consultant/copperhead-limited-0107-1363302/customer-reviews
14:14:41 <strcat[m]> m_b_: BBB is an extortion scam
14:16:25 <m_b_[m]> <strcat[m] "m_b_: BBB is an extortion scam"> fair
14:16:38 <strcat[m]> please just let me deal with the spammers and try to discuss other things again
14:18:55 <somenerd[m]> what are the differences between linux-hardened and KSPP? afaict both are basically the same
14:19:50 <strcat[m]> KSPP is the effort to upstream changes
14:20:00 <strcat[m]> linux-hardened is a downstream patch set supplementing the upstream work
14:20:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> somenerd: kspp enables upstream hardening stuff
14:20:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> And provides recommendations
14:20:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> * somenerd: kspp enables upstream hardening stuff and basically tries to get features landed upstream
14:20:48 <somenerd[m]> I see, so they're trying to replicate (or achieve parity with) grsecurity?
14:20:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> somenerd: unlikely
14:20:58 <somenerd[m]> or is it meant to be less hardened
14:21:07 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it's not *meant to be* less hardened
14:21:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a lot of internal politics going on rn
14:21:20 <strcat[m]> somenerd: the reality is that very few people are interested in building something comparable
14:21:28 <strcat[m]> somenerd: lack of contributors / resources -> no it is not going to be the same
14:21:43 <somenerd[m]> wish that grsec stayed public
14:21:58 <somenerd[m]> would've been really amazing
14:22:29 <strcat[m]> somenerd: they didn't get the support they needed
14:22:34 <yoynef[m]> I think i found a exploit but i dont know where to post it
14:22:43 <strcat[m]> somenerd: and then it all fell apart
14:22:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> yoynef: please see our responsible disclosure policy
14:23:10 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: they didn't get the support they needed
14:23:10 <somenerd[m]> yeah, don't think that upstream helped much (if at all)
14:23:14 <strcat[m]> yoynef is likely the same person as before btw
14:23:26 <strcat[m]> yoynef: substantiate that please
14:23:36 <strcat[m]> yoynef: give details and proof
14:23:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: assuming good faith that's all
14:23:39 <yoynef[m]> But i was liking to talk about it
14:23:48 <yoynef[m]> Oke
14:23:55 <strcat[m]> yoynef: ok, please send me a private message and give details/proof
14:24:33 <yoynef[m]> It has to do with a option in securty settings
14:24:45 <yoynef[m]> 1 sec
14:24:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> yoynef: you've been told to private message
14:24:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please do as instructed
14:25:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not talk about vulnerabilities in a public chat. Responsible disclosure is a thing
14:25:29 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I mean
14:25:32 <strcat[m]> they can post about it here
14:25:34 <strcat[m]> I don't really care
14:25:38 <strcat[m]> but only if they substantiate it
14:25:52 <strcat[m]> it's not permitted to make unsubstantiated claims / insinuations
14:25:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: better if it's private
14:26:05 <strcat[m]> anyway as I said
14:26:10 <strcat[m]> based on the detection script
14:26:13 <strcat[m]> likely the same person as before
14:26:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: script?
14:26:55 <strcat[m]> yoynef: I opened a private room with you, you're welcome to post all the details there and substantiate the claim
14:27:11 <yoynef[m]> Will do
14:27:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: any chance I could join?
14:27:42 <strcat[m]> just leave it be for now
14:27:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huge chance I'll have to look into it anyway
14:27:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
14:27:46 <strcat[m]> will see if there is anything to it
14:28:41 <strcat[m]> it's the same troll as before
14:28:52 <timeo[m]> Oh woah
14:29:26 * strcat[m] uploaded an image: Capture.PNG (40KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kHrckdIitRetslPmnJkHBmkD/Capture.PNG >
14:29:47 <strcat[m]> this is a nice example of how Copperhead sends people pretending to be GrapheneOS users to concern troll
14:30:17 <somenerd[m]> :/
14:30:20 <strcat[m]> this is what concern trolling means: they come here pretending to have some legitimate concern with the intent of spreading misinformation and then likely pretending they were wrongfully banned
14:30:51 <strcat[m]> I am going to be very promptly banning people who spread misinformation or unsubstantiated claims due to Copperhead heavily using sockpuppets + concern trolling
14:31:16 <strcat[m]> we have security‚äôgo for people who want to report a security vulnerability (no one has ever used that email legitimately, just to spam)
14:31:45 <strcat[m]> (people either send spam there or try to use it as a way of making their request for help / features higher priority)
14:34:15 <strcat[m]> I think it really says a lot about Copperhead that they resort to these desperate tactics
14:35:09 <strcat[m]> and, as I will continue to demonstrate, every time they attempt to harm us, we will respond with evidence-based posts about their scamming and criminal behavior
14:35:17 <strcat[m]> each time they do this, they dig their hole deeper
14:35:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I think it's really unlikely our code would have vulns tbh
14:35:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> We do focus on getting stuff done correctly
14:35:46 <dnull> strcat[m]: You spend a lot of time talking about those asshats. I get it, but let the community handle it.
14:35:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> dnull: no
14:36:15 <strcat[m]> dnull: the community is unfortunately not capable of dealing with their concern trolling
14:36:21 <timeo[m]> Just ignore it for now
14:36:42 <blacklight447[m]> strcat if you ever get harassed by users from our instance, be sure to let me know
14:36:44 <strcat[m]> dnull: I'm responding to active raids of the channels and attempts to cause harm to us
14:36:46 <timeo[m]> Lets just wait for the court day
14:37:06 <strcat[m]> dnull: if I don't deal with it people are going to fall for the concern trolling
14:37:21 <strcat[m]> I backed them into a corner and they just decided to go back to trying to hurt my feelings lol
14:37:28 <timeo[m]> We are just adding fual to the fire
14:37:45 <strcat[m]> timeo: that's a Copperhead narrative
14:37:52 <strcat[m]> timeo: they are actively spreading misinformation and causing harm to us
14:38:13 <strcat[m]> timeo: the lawsuit was filed by Copperhead primarily as a way of intimidating our contributors
14:38:14 <DFuchsiaOS_when> If they ain't waiting for the court day and spread their capping, why should they expect silence?
14:38:29 <strcat[m]> timeo: they want to scare people way from using or contributing to GrapheneOS, they repeatedly harasss and threaten people
14:38:35 <strcat[m]> timeo: their lawsuit doesn't have a legal basis
14:38:49 <strcat[m]> timeo: they cannot genuinely expect to win, you are falling for their manipulation
14:38:52 <strcat[m]> anyway, as I said before
14:38:56 <strcat[m]> I expect people to let me deal with this
14:39:02 <timeo[m]> <strcat[m] "timeo: they want to scare people"> I get that, but trolls loves this things
14:39:11 <strcat[m]> timeo: just stop, let me deal with it
14:39:16 <strcat[m]> timeo: it's you derailing the topic
14:39:25 <timeo[m]> Good idea
14:39:34 <strcat[m]> I know how to deal with it, and I don't need advice
14:39:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> timeo: it's appreciated if you stop replying. Please realise that developers are replying to you. The more our time is wasted the less time we spend doing work that actually matters
14:39:42 <strcat[m]> I told everyone in the channel how they can help already
14:39:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway I'm out now
14:40:09 <strcat[m]> people can help by spreading the Reddit posts I linked earlier with evidence of their wrongdoing
14:40:16 <strcat[m]> 5 posts (each made to both subreddits)
14:40:31 <strcat[m]> I don't need advice
14:40:41 <strcat[m]> I know far more about what's happening than any of you, and I have a lawyer who I talk to regularly
14:41:04 <strcat[m]> my lawyer's advice is CERTAINLY not that we simply let them cause harm to us and wait for the legal system to sort them out
14:41:11 <strcat[m]> so, please don't give me advice
14:41:15 <strcat[m]> you don't know what you're talking about
14:41:16 <strcat[m]> thanks
14:41:29 <timeo[m]> <strcat[m] "I told everyone in the channel h"> I sure you do but they are coming back all day and is getting to that point that we cant't chat normal anynore
14:41:39 <somenerd[m]> just let him ban
14:41:44 <timeo[m]> * I sure you do but they are coming back all day and is getting to that point that we cant't chat normal anymore
14:41:45 <strcat[m]> so stop talking about it
14:41:48 <somenerd[m]> and then move on-topic
14:41:50 <somenerd[m]> that's it
14:41:53 <strcat[m]> stop trying to give me advice and stop talking about
14:41:59 <somenerd[m]> they're succeeding if you continue talking
14:42:02 <timeo[m]> Oh sorry
14:42:15 <strcat[m]> there has no been any troll in the channel for a while
14:42:20 <strcat[m]>  * there has not been any troll in the channel for a while
14:42:35 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <strcat[m] "we have security‚äôgo "> I'm curious if there was ever a security researcher who tried to find a vulnerability in GrapheneOS?
14:42:52 <strcat[m]> yes
14:43:00 <strcat[m]> there are people who regularly help review/audit the code
14:45:08 <strcat[m]> https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ has helped with making hardened_malloc more robust recently
14:46:05 <strcat[m]> we are already very regularly reviewing / improving our own code
14:47:13 <strcat[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: we are deliberately doing things in ways that reduce risk from mistakes, etc.
14:47:42 <strcat[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: people not finding any serious issues is not an indication that they haven't been looking for them
14:48:02 <strcat[m]> it took a long time for hardened_malloc to reach v1
14:48:06 <strcat[m]> that's the most complex code we have
14:48:09 * spookyyraccoon[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/boTuJAtSdTlgFnyiwJJSssvA/message.txt >
14:48:32 <strcat[m]> spookyyraccoon: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
14:48:36 <strcat[m]> up to you if you want to use different passwords
14:48:45 <strcat[m]> they still have totally separate and different encryption keys
14:48:47 <strcat[m]> if you use the same password
14:49:04 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <strcat[m] "Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS wh"> I agree with that, I was just wondering
14:49:12 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/ has "> They're also helping with linux-hardened
14:49:15 <strcat[m]> a compromise of the device while 1 profile is logged in and a 2nd one is not would not provide access to the data in the 2nd one even if they share a password
14:49:32 <somenerd[m]> > They're also helping with linux-hardened
14:49:32 <somenerd[m]> that's cool
14:50:53 <strcat[m]> anyway that spamming seems to have stopped for the time being after their concern trolling attempt went super badly
14:51:58 <somenerd[m]> well, glad that it stopped for now
14:52:25 <strcat[m]> probably means they're moving on to other forms of attacks
14:52:30 <strcat[m]> spreading misinformation somewhere
14:52:48 <strcat[m]> keep an eye out and try to do your best to represent the community well by taking an evidence-based approach to countering them
14:52:51 <stencil[m]> Just move on
14:53:46 <strcat[m]> been going on for 12 hours so...
14:54:10 <strcat[m]> you have the freedom to stop thinking about it, I have to stay here watching the chat rooms
14:54:29 <strcat[m]> because I don't intend to close it to new people coming
14:54:33 <strcat[m]> and let them win like that
15:08:36 <sonic_the_hedgeh> Hi all. Just wanted to say thank you for all the great work. I managed to compile, sign and deploy my own version of GrapheneOS per the build manual on Debian 11. Everything looks great so far.
15:26:08 <strcat[m]> well it is the former name of the project
15:26:22 <strcat[m]> I fully intend to get the historical domain too
15:26:46 <strcat[m]> we used the name before Copperhead existed
15:27:19 <strcat[m]> and btw they do not have permission to use their logo from the person who made it
15:28:40 <sonic_the_hedgeh> Is there any way to configure GrapheneOS to deny network permissions by default?
15:28:44 <strcat[m]> sonic_the_hedgehog: no but you can go toggle it off before apps are able to launch
15:28:57 <somenerd[m]> no, it's on by default for compatibility
15:28:58 <strcat[m]> sonic_the_hedgehog: they can't launch right after being installed til you start them
15:29:29 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to make a toggle
15:29:34 <strcat[m]> for changing the default for newly installed apps
15:29:45 <strcat[m]> can't be done by default
15:30:35 <sonic_the_hedgeh> If I wantet to make such a toggle in the source, where would I start?
15:32:54 <strcat[m]> frameworks/base and look at the commit making infrastructure for special Sensors/Network permissions
15:34:01 <strcat[m]> and packages/apps/PackageInstaller
15:34:09 <strcat[m]> and then the toggle has to be in packages/apps/Settings
15:34:54 <sonic_the_hedgeh> ok, sounds great, I'll have a look.
15:36:29 <Uhrzeigersinn[m]> Would it theoretically be possible to put a toggle into the installation pop-up, so the permission can be decided each time an app gets installed?
15:36:52 <somenerd[m]> no, since the apps request the perms
15:37:34 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS can't determine if an app needs the network permission or not
15:42:44 <strcat[m]> Uhrzeigersinn: it could be a post-installation prompt
15:42:56 <strcat[m]> Uhrzeigersinn: similar to how legacy apps are handled
15:43:00 <strcat[m]> Uhrzeigersinn: but it's too complex
15:43:04 <Uhrzeigersinn[m]> <somenerd[m] "GrapheneOS can't determine if an"> I know, thats the reason for my idea. I do understand the discussion above. I'm not talking about the standard permission request pop-up, I'm talking about the little pop-up asking if I actually want to install the app. Just a little switch saying "grant network access" or so, when you hit "install".
15:43:25 <Uhrzeigersinn[m]> <strcat[m] "Uhrzeigersinn: but it's too comp"> Alright. Idea just popped into my head.
15:43:28 <strcat[m]> Uhrzeigersinn: there is a way it could be done as a post-install promopt
15:43:33 <strcat[m]>  * Uhrzeigersinn: there is a way it could be done as a post-install prompt
15:43:44 <strcat[m]> pre-API-23 apps have a prompt for their permissions list before they can launch
15:43:51 <strcat[m]> because the apps themselves do not handle runtime permissions
15:44:00 <strcat[m]> similar to how apps don't have handling of Network and Sensors existing
15:44:09 <strcat[m]> Uhrzeigersinn: but it would be too complex
15:44:20 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <strcat[m] "sonic_the_hedgehog: they can't l"> Sounds like the normal behavior, then how come some apps, sometimes like Aurora Store starts after being installed sometimes (its force stop is not greyed out)? (Is it due to it being not in force stopped state on other users with same app?)
15:44:21 <strcat[m]> Uhrzeigersinn: it's too much for us to port to each new OS version
15:44:24 <strcat[m]> beyond what we already have
15:44:47 <strcat[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: they start out force stopped, it's per-user
15:45:11 <strcat[m]> you can check with `pm`
15:46:30 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <strcat[m] "you can check with `pm`"> Okay, will do.
15:49:15 <sonic_the_hedgeh> To me having a toggle to deny network permissions to newly installed apps sounds good enough, and would fit well into my personal workflow. I would expect that the app gives some kind of feedback when it can't work because of missing network. Then can can actively decide to grant that permission or not.
15:51:49 <Publius> As a non-techie type, just wanted to say thank you to those developing/contributing to GOS project. Thanks for the hard work! GOS has been excellent so far for me.
15:52:00 <dannyknoll3[m]> <strcat[m] "and btw they do not have permiss"> hahaha.....who made it? If you're at liberty to say.
15:52:09 <Publius> And good job last night trudging through the trolls...
16:01:23 <damienrg[m]> The spell checker does not appear to use the second language that I have set in system. Is it only me?
16:06:37 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: https://twitter.com/dmix made it and Copperhead was founded as a company after he was already gone, and never had permission to use it (the open source project does)
16:07:09 <strcat[m]> anyway using the logo is pretty questionable
16:07:25 <strcat[m]> dmix owns it and the license is unclear
16:32:55 <lartiklosac[m]> Does Graphene some sort of crypto-shredding when doing a factory reset?
16:34:34 <take_a_deep_brea> larti.klosac:  Please go through https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
16:35:02 <take_a_deep_brea> it deals with how profile deletion and factory reset are handled
16:35:36 <take_a_deep_brea> > Weaver also provides reliable wiping of data since the secure element can reliably wipe a Weaver slot. Deleting a profile will wipe the corresponding Weaver slot and a factory reset of the device wipes all of the Weaver slots. The secure element also provides insider attack resistance preventing firmware updates before authenticating with the owner profile.
16:36:15 <take_a_deep_brea> just the relevant part . please go through rest of it for context .

17:43:14 <hysaag77[m]> Hello
18:44:01 <dan-is-a-bloody-> strcat: oi m8
18:44:24 <dan-is-a-bloody-> bruv, will grapheneos support android's built-in FIDO2 functionality?
18:45:34 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: Android has built-in USB, NFC and hardware keystore functionality not specifically FIDO2
18:45:45 <TheJollyRoger> dan-is-a-bloody-: There is support for NFC and WebUSB devices on GrapheneOS. However, FIDO2/U2F support on Android depends on a library normally bundled by Play Services. It's likely this library could be extracted or a cleanroom implementation could be done that could be included into GrapheneOS.
18:45:48 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: it all works properly on GrapheneOS
18:46:02 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: *some implementations* of it do
18:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Ohhhhhh, I see.
18:47:12 <dan-is-a-bloody-> boys that's proper it really is but websites want FIDO2 for passwordless login (PIN)
18:47:25 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i've tried it and now i cant go back how is FIDO2 not a standard everywhere? just fingerprint on ur phone and wham-bam-thank you m'am
18:47:40 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ur phone is always with u its so nice
18:47:49 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no need to type in the fucking OTP codes
18:48:04 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: and it works fine on GrapheneOS in an app implementing it
18:48:38 <dan-is-a-bloody-> oh i see u just need an app
18:48:49 <dan-is-a-bloody-> fuck i searched "FIDO2" on f-droid and cudnt find shit
18:49:04 <strcat[m]> not really what I'm saying
18:50:00 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: most apps choose to use the Play services library for it
18:50:04 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: oh I see, makes sense now.
18:50:19 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: which doesn't work without Play services
18:50:23 <TheJollyRoger> So if the app does it on its own, in-house, then it works, just that most apps don't do this... huh.
18:50:37 <strcat[m]> that's why it doesn't work in Chromium browsers right now
18:50:43 <dan-is-a-bloody-> strcat: no m8 i go thru the browser
18:50:55 <freestar887> we know, lol
18:50:55 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ye it needs to work in vanadium or firefox or whatever
18:50:57 <strcat[m]> yeah and Chromium only has an implementation based on Play services right now
18:51:08 <strcat[m]> it's not an OS issue
18:51:12 <strcat[m]> it's an app issue
18:51:12 <dan-is-a-bloody-> FUCK why does it always have to be so shit
18:51:20 <dan-is-a-bloody-> why cant shit just WORK
18:51:23 <strcat[m]> we don't need to implement it in the OS
18:51:26 <strcat[m]> that all works fine
18:51:41 <strcat[m]> we need to implement it in Chromium rather than using Play services
18:51:53 <strcat[m]> we can't make it work in apps choosing to implement it via Play services
18:51:58 <dan-is-a-bloody-> has anyone here ever used FIDO2? its a godsend
18:52:07 <strcat[m]> yes
18:52:09 <freestar887> yes
18:52:19 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: anyway what we need is someone to work on it
18:52:21 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: we know
18:52:24 <strcat[m]> it's an open issue somewhere
18:52:30 <strcat[m]> there's an open issue upstream in Chromium too
18:52:34 <dan-is-a-bloody-> how much money do i need to pay
18:52:37 <strcat[m]> no one working on stuff -> nothing gets done
18:52:40 <dan-is-a-bloody-> so that someone works on it
18:52:42 <strcat[m]> it's not a money issue
18:52:46 <strcat[m]> it's a lack of someone working on it issue
18:53:34 <dan-is-a-bloody-> im talking about using the android device as the FIDO2 key btw, not using an external key with NFC on the phone
18:53:46 <strcat[m]> if I had people I could trust to get work done who weren't busy
18:53:53 <strcat[m]> there are dozens of projects I would fund today
18:54:27 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: yeah that's what we would implement
18:54:55 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: we'd likely implement it as a per-app hardware keystore based feature
18:55:06 <strcat[m]> because every phone we support has 2x FIDO2 compliant keystores
18:55:16 <dan-is-a-bloody-> 2x?
18:55:16 <strcat[m]> TEE and HSM (ofc we'd use the HSM)
18:55:29 <strcat[m]> the TEE uses fingerprint reader for confirmation
18:55:35 <strcat[m]> the HSM uses power button
18:55:47 <dan-is-a-bloody-> what about entering a pin
18:56:01 <dan-is-a-bloody-> HSM seems least secure
18:56:06 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: that's not what FIDO2 spec does
18:56:13 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: HSM is far more secure than the TEE
18:56:21 <dan-is-a-bloody-> how so?
18:56:31 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i guess you're not including physical security
18:56:33 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: because it's a dedicated secure element with tiny attack surface?
18:56:47 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: it does have better physical security
18:57:01 <dan-is-a-bloody-> hsm + pin wud be perfect
18:57:04 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: a PIN doesn't make any sense
18:57:17 <dan-is-a-bloody-> why? something you have + something u know
18:57:27 <dan-is-a-bloody-> any thief can press ur power button
18:57:28 <strcat[m]> because you are entering the PIN via the OS...
18:57:31 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make any sense
18:57:32 <strcat[m]> it has 0 value
18:58:01 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: FIDO2 is usually used for 2FA auth alongside a password, you already have a password
18:58:12 <dan-is-a-bloody-> oh i see wat u mean
18:58:13 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ye phone pin + power button works
18:58:13 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: adding a PIN to FIDO2 doesn't make sense
18:58:26 <strcat[m]> unless you enter it for the HSM via secure input
18:58:31 <strcat[m]> there is no point of entering a PIN in the OS
18:58:38 <dan-is-a-bloody-> <strcat[m] "dan-is-a-bloody-legend: FIDO2 is"> no, FIDO2 is for passwordless
18:58:46 <dan-is-a-bloody-> U2F uses password
18:58:47 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: no, that's 1 option
18:58:51 <strcat[m]> you're wrong
18:58:54 <strcat[m]> nope
18:58:56 <dan-is-a-bloody-> U2F is the old protocol
18:59:05 <strcat[m]> yes, and FIDO2 is usually used with a password
18:59:23 <strcat[m]> whether or not a password is required is out of scope for us
18:59:57 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i know that the websites set if u use pw or not but the FIDO alliance specifically is pushing for passwordless whenever FIDO2 is used
19:00:09 <strcat[m]> okay but it's usually used with a password
19:00:16 <strcat[m]> and again
19:00:19 <strcat[m]> out of scope for us
19:00:29 <dan-is-a-bloody-> anyway yeah
19:00:36 <dan-is-a-bloody-> phone PIN + power button is good enough
19:01:33 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: there *isn't a way* to make it require a PIN
19:01:34 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i certainly wouldn't set a yubikey passwordless unless there's a pin on the yubikey
19:01:35 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: asking for a PIN in the OS to use it is not hardware-based security...
19:01:35 <strcat[m]> you were asking for the impossible
19:01:36 <strcat[m]> the phone does not come with a separate touchscreen for secure input on the secure element
19:02:01 <dan-is-a-bloody-> <strcat[m] "dan-is-a-bloody-legend: there *i"> there is for yubikey and other hw keys
19:02:11 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: and, again you're confused
19:02:21 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: I suggest reading about the hardware keystore
19:02:31 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: keys can be set to require that the phone is unlocked
19:02:57 <strcat[m]> the point of this is hardware-based security
19:03:11 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no there's no need to discuss cuz u already specified the phone PIN so that's good enough 4 me
19:03:13 <strcat[m]> there is no reason for us to ask for a PIN in the OS for using this... it makes no sense
19:03:15 <dan-is-a-bloody-> if the phone didnt have a PIN then it wud be pretty dangerous, someone who stole ur phone wud be able to FIDO2 into everything
19:03:30 <strcat[m]> no
19:03:43 <strcat[m]> only things using it without a password
19:03:45 <strcat[m]> and again, FIDO2 is usually used as 2FA
19:03:58 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no, FIDO2 is meant to replace passwords
19:04:14 <strcat[m]> regardless, FIDO2 is usually used with a password
19:04:16 <dan-is-a-bloody-> even if some websites aren't implementing it that way, it's the standard
19:04:21 <strcat[m]> and even if a site offers using it without one
19:04:22 <strcat[m]> they probably offer using it with one
19:04:29 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: you're incorrect
19:04:38 <Brian87> question i am trying to install grapheneos on moto g7 power (ocean) but i am not able to lock the boot loader after install anyone try to install graphene on any other device with similar issies?
19:04:45 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: I don't need you to wrongly explain a technical topic that I know well to me
19:04:49 <dan-is-a-bloody-> https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/
19:05:10 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: and?
19:05:23 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: as I said before, it's usually used with a password, and even if a site primarily uses it without one they can offer 2FA
19:05:41 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ok i get it in ur experience most websites implement FIDO2 with password
19:05:41 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: using FIDO2 as 1st factor with password as optional 2nd factor makes sense, sure
19:05:45 <freestar887> Brian87 I thought graphene can only be installed on pixel devices.
19:05:54 <entry1[m]> <Brian87 "question i am trying to install "> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
19:06:07 <entry1[m]> That device is not supported
19:06:18 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: it's not within the scope of a FIDO2 implementation to do what you are saying
19:06:37 <dan-is-a-bloody-> im not saying it should do anything, the phone is already secure with a PIN
19:07:09 <dan-is-a-bloody-> but get a hw key like a yubikey and set up a microsoft azure login and you'll see that ur hw key now requires a PIN to use
19:07:10 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: using FIDO2 as the only authentication factor is fine but sites can and should still offer 2FA as an option
19:07:13 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: and again
19:07:14 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: out of scope
19:07:26 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: and the standard certainly does not say that they shouldn't offer 2FA
19:07:28 <strcat[m]> you're very wrong
19:07:49 <strcat[m]> they're encouraged to use FIDO2 as primary authentication method
19:07:59 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i didn't say that the standard is requiring no 2FA, i'm just saying FIDO2 is meant to allow the world to transition to passwordless
19:08:03 <strcat[m]> that does not mean they are told not to offer password as optional 2nd factor
19:08:09 <dan-is-a-bloody-> which means if it gets adopted that's eventually what we'll have
19:08:13 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: yes, it's meant to allow that, not meant to *force* it
19:08:21 <dazinism> Brian87: have you made a build for the moto g7 ???
19:08:23 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i never said it meant to force it
19:08:24 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: it is not meant to *remove the option* of 2FA
19:08:30 <dan-is-a-bloody-> didnt say it did
19:08:35 <strcat[m]> you implied it
19:08:39 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no i did not
19:08:43 <dan-is-a-bloody-> you misinterpreted me
19:09:07 <strcat[m]> this is how you're supposed to implement it: you can choose between using FIDO2 or password as your primary authentication mechanism
19:09:20 <strcat[m]> now, you did that, you can choose to enable 2FA
19:09:28 <Brian87> I use graphen and a base code but leanag¬† os as a gide to put graphene on moto g 7 but i am not able to relockk the boot loader the phone goes into boot loop once i lock the boot loader
19:09:42 <strcat[m]> 2FA could be a password if your primary auth method is FIDO2
19:10:00 <strcat[m]> Brian87: so, not GrapheneOS
19:10:10 <strcat[m]> Brian87: we can't support non-GrapheneOS OSes here
19:10:21 <dazinism> Brian87: most moto phones don't allow bootloader to be locked
19:10:25 <Brian87> Yes i¬† use leanage as a fide code to i copy it
19:10:32 <strcat[m]> Brian87: we don't know about that phone, they likely don't support flashing a custom verified boot key and locking
19:10:35 <strcat[m]> Brian87: yeah, it's off-topic
19:10:38 <strcat[m]> it's not GrapheneOS at all
19:10:39 <rishabhksingh[m]> Hello, can I use the web installer on Pop!_OS?
19:10:53 <strcat[m]> rishabhksingh: not one of the officially supported/tested OSes but probably works fine
19:11:23 <Brian87> i made a build of graphne using lineage os so is graphene for moto g 7
19:11:43 <strcat[m]> that's not GrapheneOS
19:11:46 <strcat[m]> at all
19:11:47 <rishabhksingh[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: alright, thank you ^^
19:12:05 <strcat[m]> Brian87: you used some bits and pieces of our code to make a new OS
19:12:07 <strcat[m]> it's not GrapheneOS
19:12:27 <strcat[m]> we don't have any clue about the details of that phone and whether it supports verified boot / locking with an alternate OS
19:12:32 <strcat[m]> it likely does not support doing it
19:12:45 <strcat[m]> and you're not trying to install GrapheneOS on it
19:12:53 <strcat[m]> you're trying to install an OS you made, with some GrapheneOS code
19:12:55 <larsinbars[m]> what do u call it
19:13:04 <Brian87> i use lineage as a guide i did not put lineage and graphene into one OS is graphne build for moto g 7 but is not stable
19:13:13 <strcat[m]> it's not GrapheneOS
19:13:43 <Brian87> the boot loader and everything is graphene
19:13:44 <larsinbars[m]> name: Not-GrapheneOS
19:13:53 <strcat[m]> no, it's not GrapheneOS
19:14:19 <larsinbars[m]> so?
19:14:27 <strcat[m]> so, this is the channel for GrapheneOS
19:14:36 <larsinbars[m]> guess so
19:14:54 <strcat[m]> that device probably doesn't meet the requirements for a port of GrapheneOS
19:15:00 <Brian87> so id someone builds graphene for pixel 8 when it comes out its not graphene =)
19:15:17 <strcat[m]> and what he's trying to use is not GrapheneOS but rather his fork of the OS with the core components like the kernel from elsewhere
19:15:30 <strcat[m]> Brian87: a substantially different fork of GrapheneOS is not GrapheneOS
19:16:07 <larsinbars[m]> what are you actually trying to achieve? graphene stuff with something else?
19:16:13 <strcat[m]> also recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#trademark (`What about the GrapheneOS name and logo?` section)
19:16:30 <Brian87> ok i will go to android developers site to see if they can help with the boot loader issues
19:16:44 <strcat[m]> Brian87: as I said
19:16:56 <strcat[m]> Brian87: the device very likely doesn't support verified boot / locking with an alternate OS
19:16:57 <strcat[m]> most do not
19:17:05 <strcat[m]> most devices do not have the required functionality for a port of GrapheneOS
19:17:24 <strcat[m]> that device likely lacks a dozen major things that are required for official support
19:18:03 <strcat[m]> and you may think what you have is GrapheneOS but you're not using a kernel or device support code from GrapheneOS
19:18:06 <strcat[m]> it really isn't
19:19:24 <Brian87> i get that but i want graphene on my moto g 7 now so i build it myself leanage os is not as secure
19:19:31 <larsinbars[m]> what are you going to name "Not-grapgeneOS" U ARE CREATING
19:19:31 <strcat[m]> it's your own OS based on code from GrapheneOS and elsewhere
19:20:10 <d-rav[m]> ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
19:20:19 <Brian87> is open sorce how is cheating to make things work for different devices
19:20:20 <larsinbars[m]> <strcat[m] "it's your own OS based on code f"> cool
19:20:35 <entry1[m]> They both recently joined. Think theyre trolling
19:21:04 <larsinbars[m]> who are they?
19:21:16 <larsinbars[m]> I am in the mood if people here accept
19:21:19 <larsinbars[m]> üòÅ
19:22:06 <Brian87> so there is no way to lock the boot loader of moto g 7 unless i flash back to stock rom?
19:22:16 <strcat> Brian87: it may not even support that
19:22:26 <Brian87> thats bad
19:22:47 <strcat> most devices do not support verified boot / locking the bootloader with an alternate OS
19:22:53 <strcat> among other things they do not support with them
19:23:06 <strcat> many devices cannot be locked again at least realistically after using something else
19:23:25 <strcat> Brian87: do they actually offer a download of factory images to flash?
19:23:56 <strcat> you may not be able to easily fully restore it to a pristine copy of a stock OS release where you can lock it
19:24:14 <Brian87> i see
19:24:25 <Brian87> well thank you for your help
19:24:35 <Brian87> apreciate it
19:25:24 <strcat> entry1[m]: do not think Brian87 is trolling, larsinbars was and admitted to it so yeah
19:45:21 <r0tt0r[m]> <Brian87 "so there is no way to lock the b"> can only speak for moto g6, you can relock but you dont recieve ota updates anymore
19:49:43 <strcat[m]> they left already
19:53:50 <larsinbars[m]> apologize peeps, but m watching. üòÅ
19:54:30 <larsinbars[m]> * I apologize peeps, but m watching. üòÅ
20:00:01 <eyeoftiger[m]> Hello all - can we know which app does GOS use for say dialer, contacts, gallery, camera - so a list of apps that GOS has
20:00:30 <larsinbars[m]> those are all aosp guess
20:00:46 <eyeoftiger[m]> ya, want to know which one's are included in GOS
20:01:43 <larsinbars[m]> some aosp stuff, vanadium(custom chrome)
20:01:50 <larsinbars[m]> no gplay serves
20:02:08 <larsinbars[m]> rest will tell tell the peeps with expertise
20:02:12 <larsinbars[m]> üòÅ
20:03:24 <larsinbars[m]> also awesome battery backup forgot to mention
20:05:54 <strcat[m]> eyeoftiger: we're not into bundling apps
20:06:51 <strcat[m]> eyeoftiger: https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
20:08:18 <strcat[m]> eyeoftiger: Seedvault is the only externally developed non-AOSP app we bundle and only because it has to be built into the base OS and made into the backup provider for the OS to work
20:10:36 <eyeoftiger[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I got a S20 from samsung and am trying to de-google and install aosp/GOS apps
20:10:51 <eyeoftiger[m]> wish GOS was compatible/certified with S20
20:16:28 <larsinbars[m]> <eyeoftiger[m] "@strcat:matrix.org: I got a S20 "> I have an Mi A2 just working out things with custom roms ryt now, waiting for mi a2 support
20:18:59 <eyeoftiger[m]> I removed lots of bloatware and then some google.android packages and it broke the OS, had to rest to factory 3 times
20:19:18 <eyeoftiger[m]> but don't have any play services, have F-droid, arora store
20:19:33 <eyeoftiger[m]> so far seems to be good
20:26:43 <larsinbars[m]> welcome yzernik
21:29:04 <RoyValentine[m]> Hello. I previously setup SeedVault to backup on my Pixel 3A XL but at some point, probably after an update, I no longer saw backups happening.
21:29:04 <RoyValentine[m]> When I go to Settings -> System  I see that Backup says "Off" and when I click on "Backup" I am taken to a black settings screen which used to show the SeedVault page. Are there currently any issues?
21:35:51 <NewUser> Is this where lost souls end up who run into issues with the GrapheneOS installation guide?
21:36:46 <larsinbars[m]> no this is where lost souls come and fet a new life with GOS
21:36:54 <larsinbars[m]> * no this is where lost souls come and get a new life with GOS
21:39:23 <NewUser> Should I go ahead and paste the contents of my console that's been stuck flashing the same file for 20 minutes now or should I find somewhere else to ask installation questions?
21:42:36 <alex-resist> NewUser did you follow the official instructions on the GrapheneOS website?
21:43:36 * RoyValentine[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VWWsZQSXfRtHEdpVrkfTciQS/message.txt >
21:43:41 <NewUser> as best I could I followed CLI install.¬† I got to "Flashing Factory Images" before I encountered what appears to be a hang.
21:44:33 <alex-resist> What computer are you using? What USB port? What operating system?
21:45:08 <NewUser> Acer predator, USB C on the side, Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS
21:45:23 <entry1[m]> <NewUser "as best I could I followed CLI i"> Have you tried the web install? That is what is recommended.
21:46:31 <alex-resist> NewUser you could try running the web install inside Chromium/Chrome. Otherwise this might become a lengthy troubleshooting procedure
21:47:37 <NewUser> Ok, I'll do that.¬† Hopefully I won't be back.¬† Was hoping to avoid installing chromium if I could.¬† If its so strongly preferred then you may want to add it to the troubleshooting guide on the CLI page.
21:48:12 <alex-resist> "Officially supported browsers for the web install method: Chromium" is already on the website
21:48:45 <alex-resist> Chromium itself is okay, you should give it a try
21:49:06 <nullnode[m]> It does say it at the start of the CLI page
21:49:09 <nullnode[m]> "The web installer is an easier approach to installing the official releases via a browser with WebUSB support."
21:49:31 <NewUser> so it does
21:59:35 <psychologicaldam> NewUser: if you followed the instructions exactly but it still didn't work, it could be the usb-c port on the laptop (it's mentioned in the guide that it often doesn't work properly). Should work better with a usb-a to c cable
22:25:26 <eyeoftiger[m]> <alex-resist "Chromium itself is okay, you sho"> alex-resist: pardon my ignorance, so Chromium  is google chrome ?
22:49:35 <mynacol[m]> <eyeoftiger[m] "alex-resist: pardon my ignorance"> Not exactly. Chromium is the base for Google Chrome. It is open source and partially decoupled from Google. Most Linux distributions do provide chromium in their package repository.
22:55:09 <eyeoftiger[m]> ok TY,

23:36:55 <nullnode[m]> hmm I'm seeing the normal settings on my Pixel 3a, same build version
23:36:58 <dazinism> RoyValentine: in your settings menu search for seedvault
23:37:10 <dazinism> Make sure its not disabled
23:37:38 <dazinism> Maybe clear its storage?
23:37:42 <nullnode[m]> can you disable it even?
23:38:08 <nullnode[m]> clearing storage would clear his already existing backup keys wouldn't it?
23:38:41 <dazinism> If its not working think its worth a try
23:38:49 <nullnode[m]> I would plug into a device and run adb logcat, and see if and what errors are present
23:38:59 <nullnode[m]> Find the issue, before clearing the issue
23:39:15 <dazinism> Just means you'd have to write down a new restore code
23:47:41 <morepheus_x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "morepheus_x: I can't do a walkth"> Thanks for the reply, I think you meant to say, I would damage the phone.    Let me explain the situation, I've partially installed GOS. i.e. I installed twice due to disconnections and connections during the flashing process.    However, I've I can't get out of fastboot mode.   I've made several judgement decision that led me to here.  1 i was using a Debian and
23:47:41 <morepheus_x[m]> Firefox +>  So I tried the CLI method, because the buttons on web download version didn't work on Firefox.  I know that the recommended method is the webbrowser(chrome) method.   However, you must have gotten to the preferred method via trial and error.  I am sure somewhere in your compatibility testing someone has experienced what I went through.   Now, I am trying to reinstall the original OS, then perform an
23:47:41 <morepheus_x[m]> update then install GOS.   Initially, I was worried that any update after I turned on the device could comprise the device.   Silly Huh?  Updates that comprise devices?     So, now I am at the point of either trying it from a Windows machine or continue to try it from a Linux distro..
