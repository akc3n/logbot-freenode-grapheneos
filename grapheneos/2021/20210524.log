20:04:50 <strcat> For details on why we're moving away from freenode:

20:07:49 <b1101> so I can't use the same client to join those rooms correct? I use hexchat currently
22:00:38 <jelly> b1101, hexchat can connect to multiple irc networks at the same time, but it can't connect to matrix directly
22:03:29 <b1101> jelly: that's what I thought. is there a plan to close this channel? I use irc for other channels on freedone as well. what happened is sad :(
22:07:49 <jelly> I'd say it's already closed for business
22:09:34 <strcat> b1101: you should use Element and join #grapheneos:grapheneos.org / #grapheneos-offtopic:grapheneos.org
22:09:44 <b1101> I saw the post on the website a few weeks back.
22:10:11 <strcat> b1101: you can join #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat (freenode replacement from the old staff) but we aren't going to have the same kind of bridge to it
22:10:12 <b1101> I need a separate application for it
22:10:15 <strcat> and most people are on Matrix
22:10:21 <strcat> yes, you do, but it's a much better experience overall
22:10:29 <strcat> especially since most people are using it
22:11:23 <strcat> b1101: you can use web client, it's the same thing as the desktop client in a browser anyway
22:12:08 <strcat> b1101: you can join the libera.chat channels in Hexchat but Matrix will be a much better experience, especially since we aren't running the same kind of bridge again (too invasive / broken)
22:12:12 <b1101> I don't want a browser logged into an application of this sort. all my browsers run strictly on private browsing, and I close them often.
22:12:21 <strcat> well, Element desktop or mobile client then
22:12:53 <strcat> it's nicer to use Element for IRC than using Hexchat for IRC channels that are bridged to rooms on Matrix
22:12:56 <strcat> *shrug*
22:13:27 <b1101> interesting. I wouldn't mind replacing hexchat, depending on the app
22:13:33 <strcat> IRC -> Matrix largely works fine in bridged channels but Matrix -> IRC is very lossy since IRC doesn't have long messages, formatting, reacts, media, etc.
22:13:44 <strcat> Element also has end-to-end encryption with proper multi-session support
22:14:04 <strcat> proper E2E encryption with forward secrecy
22:29:39 <b1101> so is the plan to completely evacuate this channel at some point? I joined libera.chat. don't know if I'm going to have a client and run it for one channel. don't think any other channels that I idle in are moving anywhere. yet anyway
23:11:27 <strcat> b1101: Arch Linux, NixOS, Gentoo, etc. are all leaving freenode
23:11:29 <strcat> and many others
23:11:36 <strcat> b1101: smaller projects are less organized / attentive to this stuff
23:11:56 <strcat> NixOS went to Matrix, Gentoo and Arch are going to libera.chat
23:12:04 <strcat> Alpine went to OFTC
23:17:12 <b1101> I use Slackware. wonder if they will
