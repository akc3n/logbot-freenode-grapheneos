02:12:52 <faxing[m]> Weird
02:13:04 <faxing[m]> Maybe I'm missing something -- just enable Bluetooth on the settings of both phones, keep them close together, send the message. Right?
02:16:58 <VixenXY> Yep
02:22:32 <VixenXY> Just tested on 2 phones loaded with graphene (internet and over WiFi tired off) and it works

05:31:33 <sendapollo[m]> Is there a fast way to shutdown/quickly lock system? Currently only way to do this seems to be -> bring phone out of pocket -> hold side key button -> look for and click power button via touch screen.
05:31:33 <sendapollo[m]> Just seems unintuitive for security purposes.
05:40:24 <akc3n[m]> sendapollo:
05:40:24 <akc3n[m]> > GrapheneOS enables support for ending secondary user profile sessions after logging into them. It adds an end session button to the lockscreen and in the global action menu accessed by holding the power button. This fully purges the encryption keys and puts the profiles back at rest. This can't be done for the owner profile without rebooting due to it encrypting the sensitive system-wide operating system data.

13:14:19 <Reklu> I'm still amazed just how good this OS is after 18 months of daily use !
13:57:27 <rawtaz> hi. i keep having this insanely problematic issue that if i am on a call with someone, and another calls comes in, the current call is simply shut down by my phone (im not touching anything), and the incoming one is showing the screen where i can choose to answer or not (the regular one, as with any incoming call).
13:57:50 <rawtaz> i havent found a setting for this, so can someone enlighten me as to what's causing this and how to make it not close the current call?
13:58:04 <rawtaz> one day i'll be on a seriously important call and it's shut down and it will be bad :O
13:58:12 <rawtaz> it's on a pixel 4a with the latest grapheneos on it.
14:10:41 <GhostSplinterSix> That sounds like a device issue and not the OS.
14:12:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Ask your carrier, it might a setting on their side
14:27:46 <rawtaz> GrapheneOS-Teleg: i could do that. i'd be surprised if it's a carrier thing, but come to think of it it could very well be (they have the ability to shut down a call of course)
14:33:43 <rawtaz> i take it neither of you peeps here know of a setting in grapheneos to control this behavior then?
15:15:18 <marshall12> hello guys. I have installed GRAPHENEOS few weeks ago, and i still have a problem with notifications for viber, whatsapp and wickerme
15:16:22 <marshall12> i do activate all notification settings  for push messages and backround connecttions
15:16:27 <marshall12> and still notihing....
15:17:00 <marshall12> if i want to read my messages - i need to enter the app and only then - i can see my new messages
15:17:14 <marshall12> no chacne to receive my new messages in real time
15:17:56 <Golli162IQinform> For apps that rely on `Google Play services` for their notification system, you will not be able to receive live notifications.
15:19:08 <marshall12> im using ayrora store, without registration (anonimus user)
15:21:00 <marshall12> AURORA STORE
15:21:08 <marshall12> for app download
15:21:29 <helloworldkk87[m> Most apps on Aurora store needs Play Services for notifications
15:22:13 <helloworldkk87[m> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
15:22:34 <helloworldkk87[m> https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services
16:02:52 <marshall12> i use to read links you send me , but i still dont understand what should i do to activate notifications
16:02:57 <marshall12> to install google play ad ?
16:03:05 <marshall12> google play service AD ?
16:03:29 <marshall12> i did it, but still there is no real time notifications
16:04:04 <marshall12> is it necessary to register an aurora account ?
16:04:26 <marshall12> or to download google play store and register my account ?
16:05:44 <helloworldkk87[m> Google Play Services is not part of GrapheneOS and never will be. If the app depends of them the notifications will not work.
16:06:08 <GhostSplinterSix> ^
16:06:37 <jj1013[m]> <marshall12 "or to download google play store"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services
16:08:27 <marshall12> is wickerme independent of google play servicer or not ?
16:08:35 <marshall12> it is very imoprant for me
16:08:39 <marshall12> all depends of wickerme
16:09:00 <marshall12> for me and my need
16:09:03 <marshall12> needs
16:09:45 <helloworldkk87[m> I dont use it so I dont know
16:27:49 <nscnt[m]> marshall12: It's dependent
16:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> marshall12: All you can do is go to the people who write that app and either request, petition or coerce them to write their app in such a way that it no longer requires Google Play Services for full functionality. That's all you can do from your chair.
16:30:46 <TheJollyRoger> There is no app you can install, and no setting you can configure.
16:31:55 <TheJollyRoger> The developers have written their app in such a way that it is broken without Google being deeply integrated into and a part of your phone's operating system.
16:42:08 <Ed[m]> Look into something called microg, should allow you to run it
16:48:46 <annoxi[m]> Is this the correct place to ask questions about the installation process of grapheneOS?

17:18:35 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/contact#reporting-issues
17:18:59 <strcat[m]> the server configurations were tweaked a bit to deal with ongoing poor attempts at doing DoS attacks
17:19:10 <strcat[m]> one of the changes ~40 mins ago needed a little tweak to fix it
17:19:22 <strcat[m]> if someone had pinged me I'd have fixed it in 15 seconds
17:19:36 <strcat[m]> or if someone had filed an issue on the tracker for the service
17:20:03 <strcat[m]> if you don't report issues, they don't get fixed (please don't report other kinds of issues to me on Matrix/IRC, but something like that where a service is broken is fine)
17:22:04 <annoxi[m]> I have read the contact form information. I will keep that in mind. I did not want to start pinging devs here so I just asked.
17:28:43 <TheJollyRoger> annoxi[m]: on behalf of the developers, the discretion's greatly appreciated! Welcome aboard.

19:06:22 <devada[m]> Oppo f1
19:07:05 <strcat[m]> it's open source
19:07:07 <strcat[m]> you can do what you want
19:07:23 <strcat[m]> most devices do not support the requirements to provide the expected security
19:07:27 <strcat[m]> so they can't be officially supported
19:07:32 <strcat[m]> lots of info available on the site
19:07:39 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
19:07:52 <devada[m]> I know its open source but I don't know how to build for my own

19:08:14 <devada[m]> That's the problem
19:08:36 <strcat[m]> if you're asking here rather than working on it then it's probably not going to work out
19:11:05 <devada[m]> Thanks for the info
19:18:24 <deadlydata[m]> hey i noticed if you go into bootloader and click show barcode , the phone outputs imei, seriel number sim EID etc
19:18:54 <deadlydata[m]> displaying this in bootloader is very compromising
19:19:40 <deadlydata[m]> is there a way to delete this or is it one of them things that has to stay haha
19:20:52 <strcat[m]> it's regulatory compliance and isn't compromising
19:21:00 <strcat[m]> not really sure what you mean by that
19:21:09 <strcat[m]> someone who has physical access to the device can inherently obtain those things
19:21:23 <strcat[m]> it's required that devices either have it on a label or a way to display it like that
19:21:29 <strcat[m]> that's why it has an option to display it as barcodes
19:21:32 <strcat[m]> regulatory compliance
19:22:38 <strcat[m]> take out your SIM tray
19:22:41 <strcat[m]> look at what's written across it
19:22:45 <strcat[m]> the IMEI
19:22:55 <strcat[m]> and of course it could just be obtained from the hardware itself
19:23:12 <deadlydata[m]> I understand your point, good point.
19:23:21 <strcat[m]> if someone has physical access to the device they can obtain that stuff from hw
19:23:27 <strcat[m]> the SSD, etc. also has identifiers
19:23:32 <strcat[m]> hardware has serial numbers, in general
19:23:47 <strcat[m]> most of the chips probably have serial numbers written on them and also obtainable from them
19:23:52 <strcat[m]>  * most of the chips probably have serial numbers written on them and also often obtainable from them
19:24:45 <shibboleth> from where are /proc/device-tree/chosen/cdt/cdb items populated?
19:25:38 <strcat[m]> device tree is filled in by the late stage bootloader
19:26:39 <deadlydata[m]> strcat: law enforcement will rely on that bootloader screen to get the imei etc, would be so funny to put some spoofed values there
19:26:40 <deadlydata[m]> haha
19:27:26 <shibboleth> and is there a way to determine which mtdblock/offsets it reads these values from?
19:28:01 <shibboleth> the IMEI is likely stored in the EFS as per qualcomm standards, but the wifi, bluetooth mac is like simply read from a static mtd offset
19:29:24 <strcat[m]> why would that be different?
19:29:33 <strcat[m]> implemented by the same baseband chip / firmware in separate sandboxes
19:29:45 <strcat[m]> the Wi-Fi / Bluetooth implementation is on the same chip
19:30:16 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: not clear what you're trying to accomplish
19:31:19 <shibboleth> i'm trying to edit the devices bluetooth mac
19:31:21 <b1101> is there no birthday date in contacts?
19:31:37 <b1101> like a field to input the day I mean
19:31:44 <shibboleth> graphene has wifi mac randomization, but i'd like to avoid disclosing the factory bluetooth mac from ever being used
19:31:55 <shibboleth> used/disclosed, whatever
19:33:37 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: that's not how Bluetooth works
19:33:50 <shibboleth> i get what you're saying
19:33:59 <strcat[m]> what makes you think a persistent identifier is disclosed?
19:34:02 <shibboleth> but that's not entirely true
19:34:20 <shibboleth> it's not very hard to determine the actual bluetooth mac
19:34:21 <shibboleth> you
19:34:57 <shibboleth> you'd need an ubertooth or a cambridge silicon bluetooth device with patched firmware, but it's not hard
19:35:59 <shibboleth> or any of the likely umpteen bluetooth-bases solutions used in metro/retail/foo tracking
19:36:19 <shibboleth> also, also: userland (droid) may have access to the burned-in bluetooth mac
19:38:10 <shibboleth> all i wanna do is change the wifi and bluetooth mac *once* to avoid these UUIDs from being disclosed, then rely on userspace randomization from there
19:38:34 <shibboleth> and these values are stored in some mtdblock at some specific offset
19:40:55 <strcat[m]> this isn't correct
19:41:28 <shibboleth> i'm familiar with arm and device trees from openwrt and there it'd simply be a matter of looking at the device .dts to determine where these values are stored
19:41:40 <shibboleth> what isn't correct?
19:45:14 <strcat[m]> the Bluetooth MAC address isn't revealed over the air as you're implying
19:45:46 <strcat[m]> you also seem to be assuming it's still a separate chip like when Broadcom Wi-Fi/Bluetooth was used
19:45:50 <strcat[m]> it worked a lot differently
19:46:20 <shibboleth> ipq806x is an SOC just like with what we're used to in droid
19:47:10 <Guest777888> hi
19:47:26 <Guest777888> can anyone help installing grapheneos
19:47:29 <GhostSplinterSix> 👋🏻
19:47:30 <Guest777888> in pixel 3
19:48:42 <strcat[m]> use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
19:49:23 <Guest777888> what do I do when I go in to boot interface on the phone
19:49:47 <shibboleth> strcat[m], https://github.com/pwnieexpress/blue_hydra
19:50:03 <strcat[m]> Guest777888: follow the steps there
19:50:20 <shibboleth> that's for use with commodity/cots bluetooth adapters.
19:50:23 <strcat[m]> Guest777888: did you enable OEM unlocking as explained, then boot into the bootloader interface?
19:51:04 <shibboleth> sep solutions for use with ubertooth or patched csi adapters to get the full, burned in bluetooth mac/uuid
19:51:20 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: tracking them through rotations of their random addresses doesn't imply the original MAC is obtained
19:51:47 <shibboleth> as i've said: bluehydra doesn't do this with cots hw
19:52:06 <shibboleth> but with an ubertooth you really can get the permanent mac.
19:52:10 <strcat[m]> I know the way it rotates doesn't prevent tracking but there shouldn't be any leaks of the hardware address over the air
19:52:30 <shibboleth> but now we're going off on a tangent
19:53:15 <shibboleth> nvm all that, does anyone know which file/where i can find the offsets being probed to determine the wifi/bt macs by droid/late bootloader?
19:53:34 <strcat[m]> I don't know how that's a tangent
19:54:01 <strcat[m]> you're making claims about that do not appear to be accurate an I'd like to know why you're saying that
19:54:10 <shibboleth> as in: instead of answering my question you... challenge the basis for me wanting to do this
19:54:41 <strcat[m]> because what you say is the basis for wanting to do it would be a problem that should be fixed
20:01:02 <shibboleth> strcat[m], https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/ubertooth/blob/master/host/doc/ubertooth-rx.md
20:01:44 <strcat[m]> that's classic bluetooth rather than BLE?
20:02:02 <shibboleth> still bluetooth?
20:02:18 <strcat[m]> only BLE has privacy
20:02:31 <shibboleth> after a fashion...
20:02:40 <shibboleth> anyway, let's not make this a conversation about how bluetooth works, my question was re determining where in the efs/whatever these values are stored
20:02:56 <Cooligans> Sorry for interrupting, but does GrapheneOS use linux as its kernel?
20:03:30 <strcat[m]> yes
20:03:36 <Cooligans> Thanks!
20:04:15 <rny[m]> what a weird question
20:08:16 <shibboleth> "android" is, mostly a running fork of the linux kernel+userland tools
20:08:34 <strcat[m]> Android works with a mainline kernel
20:09:41 <strcat[m]> userspace stuff isn't the same as what traditional desktop/server distributions use
20:10:22 <strcat[m]> unclear what about userspace you're talking about specifically but it's not the same ALSA, *nix utilities, SELinux stuff, etc.
20:11:04 <devada[m]> <rny[m] "what a weird question"> Its weird for you but someone learning new about mobile OS , isn't .
20:12:02 <fantazma> Hi
20:12:47 <rny[m]> i thought it was weird because they just asked if its linux without any follow-up
20:16:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Can i confirm is this correct, the Mac spoofer , at my place work when I turn WiFi off and on , each time my pixel connects, the router thinks its a new device, does it change the mac address each time it connects?
20:17:21 <shibboleth> well, this also seems to be the default behavior in droid10/11
20:17:24 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
20:17:33 <shibboleth> sep option in the developer options
20:17:45 <strcat[m]> what does?
20:17:50 <strcat[m]> the MAC randomization doesn't work the same way
20:18:03 <shibboleth> not the same way, no
20:18:12 <strcat[m]> stock OS has 2 states (per-network), GrapheneOS adds a 3rd that it uses as the default
20:18:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Yeah I've read this , its actually impressive if this is true, all I can see on the router is the pixel 5 showing as unknown and a different Mac everytime it connects ?
20:18:59 <strcat[m]> the stock OS one is a persistent address lasting as long as the dhcp lease
20:19:13 <strcat[m]> please read https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
20:20:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Yeah I've read this mate but I just wanted to confirm
20:21:05 <strcat[m]> the documentation is a lot more reliable than the chat
20:22:27 <shibboleth> settings list secure | grep bluetooth
20:22:40 <shibboleth> is this one being used by graphene?
20:28:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> I agree I do like the documentation but for me to understand things I need to ask in different ways. And yes it's a pixel 5 with graphene but I didn't realise everytime the phone connects it changes the mac
20:29:56 <TheJollyRoger> @L73689 - by default, it is randomized. However, you can if you want to, change it to a per-network MAC, if say for instance, you do MAC address whitelisting on your home or workplace WiFi.
20:33:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Thanks, yeah I noticed that option, i think it will be OK for me to leave it as randomizing :)
20:34:05 <Ed[m]> btw i noticed that since installing the update, rebooting the device is faster, is this one of the things fixed in the new update?
20:34:18 <strcat[m]> no
20:34:21 <strcat[m]> there's a changelog
20:34:23 <strcat[m]> nothing about that was changed
20:34:28 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
20:34:34 <ChessGuevara> Yeah it was
20:34:41 <ChessGuevara> It was changes in March
20:34:48 <ChessGuevara> *changed
20:34:51 <strcat[m]> no
20:34:56 <strcat[m]> it wasn't
20:35:24 <strcat[m]> the changelog on the site is accurate
20:35:25 <Ed[m]> well, thats odd
20:35:46 <Ed[m]> im also assuming rebooting takes longer because of the memory hardening right?
20:36:25 <strcat[m]> it's not specifically that, no
20:36:44 <Ed[m]> then what else could it be?
20:37:13 <strcat[m]> regular reboots and rebooting after an update also really aren't the same thing
20:37:21 <strcat[m]> and the latter depends on how much the update changed
20:37:23 <strcat[m]> and how you installed it
20:38:26 <Ed[m]> well, normal reboots take pretty long
20:38:28 <Ed[m]> so idk
20:39:05 <Ed[m]> but the second reboot after i begun the install process was like way faster
20:39:20 <strcat[m]> nothing was changed that would make reboots faster
20:39:33 <strcat[m]> the changelog on the site is accurate
20:39:36 <Ed[m]> welp, guess it just werks better now
20:39:40 <strcat[m]> you don't need to ask what was changed, you can look there
20:39:45 <Ed[m]> cant complain
20:39:46 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work better now, that wasn't changed
20:40:02 <Ed[m]> <strcat[m] "you don't need to ask what was c"> true
20:40:24 <strcat[m]> you can't start measuring until the screen about booting an alternate OS goes away
20:40:34 <strcat[m]> because it pauses for 5 seconds before booting it unless you bypass the screen
20:40:44 <strcat[m]> booting really doesn't take that long
20:40:44 <strcat[m]> not really sure what you're talking about
20:41:09 <Ed[m]> also is there no way to get root access on graphene? i wanna try the out the bromite webview thing
20:41:12 <strcat[m]> depends on device model, can't compare it for the boot after an update (has to do extra work)
20:41:23 <Ed[m]> no offense to vanadium but i perfer bromite
20:41:28 <Ed[m]>  * no offense to vanadium but i prefer bromite
20:41:38 <strcat[m]> no, you can't modify the OS
20:41:44 <strcat[m]> without making your own build
20:41:51 <strcat[m]> suggest reading the docs on the site
20:42:09 <Ed[m]> <strcat[m] "without making your own build"> is there a flag in the makefile or something that would allow you to do that
20:42:22 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
20:42:25 <Ed[m]> also my hardware isnt good enough to build it myself
20:42:46 <Ed[m]> <strcat[m] "don't know what you mean"> like is there an option in the build settings to enable the root acc or soemthing
20:42:54 <strcat[m]> no
20:42:57 <strcat[m]> there is no 'root account'
20:43:10 <strcat[m]> that's not how the OS works
20:43:33 <strcat[m]> there is never root accessible to the UI / application layer, it would fundamentally break the security model
20:44:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Ed[m] "like is there an option in the b"> Android does not have anything like root
20:44:33 <strcat[m]> already explained above
20:44:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even stuff like init is put in constrained domains
20:44:36 <strcat[m]> doesn't need to be repeated
20:44:55 <Ed[m]> man google really over engineered android what the hell
20:45:06 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean by that
20:45:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Stuff like magisk works by introducing a permissive domain or making the init domain permissive and allowing untrusted_app and some other domains to transition to it
20:45:12 <strcat[m]> you appear to be concern trolling in the channel regularly
20:45:27 <Ed[m]> how exactly
20:45:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ed: there's no overengineering
20:45:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's how selinux works
20:46:21 <strcat[m]> my impression is they're being disingenuous and want to waste time
20:46:38 <strcat[m]> they're regularly here, they've seen detailed explanations for these things
20:47:12 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's productive, whether it's good faith or not
20:47:24 <strcat[m]> consider it concern trolling either way
20:49:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "consider it concern trolling eit"> Concern trolling is the new fad?
20:49:44 <strcat[m]> I don't think another detailed explanation of how the security model works is appropriate and I'm simply not interested in people derailing the channel and spreading misinformation here
21:01:38 <panoramics[m]> Is it possible that voice calls via Bluetooth headphones are not possible in grapheme OS? I tried three different pairs of headphones and none of them work on a pixel 5 whereas on other android devices, no problem
21:02:13 <TheJollyRoger> panoramics[m]: They're working fine for me and always have been.
21:02:31 <Patrick[m]4> <strcat[m] "I don't think another detailed e"> I get that, too many dumb questions are being asked here that can be answered by reading the website
21:02:50 <TheJollyRoger> I just have a bunch of el-cheapo bluetooth adapters with microphones that I use for phone calls.
21:02:58 <TheJollyRoger> Works fine.
21:03:09 <panoramics[m]> <TheJollyRoger "panoramics: They're working fine"> Care to share which ones you've been using? Having some air pods right now, not working somehow
21:03:17 <panoramics[m]> Ah ok
21:03:28 <panoramics[m]> Very strange
21:03:56 <TheJollyRoger> Taotronics TT-BR06
21:04:18 <panoramics[m]> I had exactly those before, didn't work
21:04:22 <TheJollyRoger> Again, nothing special about it, the advantage with these things is that virtually every store has them, they're a dime a dozen.
21:04:30 <strcat[m]> Patrick: the issue is more people approaching asking questions as 'make inaccurate claims and force people to refute them'
21:04:31 <panoramics[m]> Constant interruptions in connectivity. Only during calls though, not for listening to music
21:04:47 <strcat[m]> Patrick: I don't consider that asking a question
21:05:26 <TheJollyRoger> I use these for calls and music, working fine. May be a hardware issue on your end.
21:05:43 <Patrick[m]4> <strcat[m] "Patrick: the issue is more peopl"> Yeah fair
21:05:52 <panoramics[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I use these for calls and music,"> Brand new pixel 5... I'd be surprised
21:06:04 <panoramics[m]> Especially since for music, its no problem at all. I don't get it
21:06:14 <strcat[m]> it would be nice if people checked site, went with the detailed info there, and also checked for past conversations here
21:06:33 <TheJollyRoger> Well, if anyone else finds the same, hopefully they'll chime in.
21:06:43 <strcat[m]> but the issue is mainly this whole concern trolling thing
21:09:21 <strcat[m]> matrix is super broken
21:09:49 <strcat[m]> trying to unban them after talking to them
21:09:51 <strcat[m]> doesn't work

21:40:42 <strcat[m]> there are some stock OSes without Google apps/services integrated
21:45:29 <strcat[m]> AOSP is the starting point and doesn't have them
21:45:30 <strcat[m]> the stock OS adds them, AOSP doesn't remove them
21:45:30 <strcat[m]> it's the other way around from how it's portrayed
21:45:39 <GhostSplinterSix> > <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> What do you mean by "stock Android"?
21:45:39 <GhostSplinterSix> > Stock ROMs are not deGoogled, they are modified further by the manufacturer.
21:45:40 <GhostSplinterSix> ...(truncated)
22:05:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> GhostSplinterSix: I guess you've never heard of #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
22:09:53 <GhostSplinterSix> <anupritaisno1[m] "GhostSplinterSix: I guess you've"> Okay. And?
22:12:47 <strcat[m]> 'stock' refers to it being the OS shipping on the device and that's never just AOSP
22:13:39 <strcat[m]> the OS they're starting from does not have Play services or customized support for their device
22:13:57 <strcat[m]> so at a minimum they're usually adding Google's unbundled Play services / app integration
22:14:16 <strcat[m]> which overrides a bunch of resources, replaces some AOSP components with Google ones, bundles assorted apps, sets up default / privileged permissions for them, etc.
22:14:36 <strcat[m]> that's only part of the difference from AOSP -> stock OS on Pixels
22:14:39 <strcat[m]> they start from AOSP
22:14:44 <strcat[m]> they use the AOSP source tree, and add repos to it
22:15:02 <strcat[m]> they don't change the AOSP repos, but rather add more repos, in some cases set up to override components, etc.
22:15:06 <strcat[m]> low-level OS is the same
22:15:25 <strcat[m]> certain app-based components, resources, properties, etc. are overridden
22:16:21 <sfhsjr[m]> Sorry maybe I shouldve sent that in the off topic one lol
22:16:21 <sfhsjr[m]> I was wrong to say stock. I think i meant the os on the pixel phones which are owned by Google and i guess it makes sense now.
22:16:21 <sfhsjr[m]> Sorry for the confusion and thank you strcat for the details!
22:32:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s​ilentsolutions> does factory reset via settings menu also completely wipe the titan m?
22:33:08 <strcat[m]> yes
