00:19:23 <Cliff[m]> What is the best navigation app for graphene?
00:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: Apps not included with GrapheneOS are best discussed in #grapheneos-offtopic, please take conversations about those there.
00:21:23 <TheJollyRoger> Questions about those should be kept to that channel, please.
00:22:29 <eleberum[m]> Hey I cant seem to add contacts because it tells me I "need to add an account that will back up my contacts". When I press add account it goes nowhere.
00:23:08 <eleberum[m]> <eleberum[m] "Hey I cant seem to add contacts "> In the stock phone app
00:23:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hello eleberum[m], that's a bug from upstream since the contacts app is stubbed out. Hit back a few times or import.
00:26:12 <eleberum[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hello eleberum, that's a bug fro"> Hitting a back a few times didn't work. How do I go about importing?
00:26:30 <TheJollyRoger> Tap the menu item and head to settings.
00:28:09 <TheJollyRoger> Either that, or what you can do is add and provision an app like Signal, OpenKeychain, or Linphone that will provision an account (don't worry, it's not a Google account, it just makes Android shut up about having accounts on the device, it's clientside), and then that should get it to shut up.
00:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> If all else fails, do that.
00:30:41 <eleberum[m]> Thank you TheJollyRoger I got it working now.
00:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear!
00:30:51 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard!

06:12:07 <derrytavis[m]> I'm having difficulty transferring files to my phone from my laptop via MTP and a usb cord. I'm using simple-mtpfs on Arch Linux and although I can see and remove files on my phone, I get an error when I try to copy files to it.
06:39:06 <Ed[m]2> <derrytavis[m] "I'm having difficulty transferri"> i know this isnt a direct solution to your problem, but you should check out something called syncthing for file transfers in general
06:39:25 <Ed[m]2> using it myself to sync my music between my phone and linux computer, pretty comfy
06:39:44 <derrytavis[m]> I'll try that right now.
06:40:32 <Ed[m]2> <derrytavis[m] "I'll try that right now."> luke smith made a good video about it, same with chris ochcipinitii.
06:40:39 <derrytavis[m]> By the way, the problem has nothing to do with enabling file transfer from the phone. I've done that and nothing works.

06:42:40 <derrytavis[m]> I haven't tried mounting the GrapheneOS phone using another computer, no. But mounting other phones to the same computer works without any issues.
06:43:03 <Ed[m]2> well, that rules out it being a computer issue

08:26:45 <helloworldkk87[m> Morning:)
09:10:00 <GhostSplinterSix> How's everybody doing?
09:14:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> speedkills588 (@f​ix5000) has joined the Telegram Group!
09:15:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Harasho bleat.   I wanted to ask, is VoLTE force enabled in Graphene or is it just using the incomplete Google enabled carriers?
09:15:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> we can chat in off-topic, and probably should)
09:32:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://grapheneos.org/usage
09:33:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can turn on "LTE-only" mode
09:33:04 <GhostSplinterSix> What about it?
09:33:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> speedskills588 asked a question over Telegram
09:34:48 <GhostSplinterSix> Ah.
09:43:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Thanks! I am talking where the enabled list comes from, is it via vendor.xml list that is provided by AOSP/Google or is the build.prop force enabling VoLTE even for carriers that aren't on the google list?
09:43:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> For example, I don't get VoLTE on stock, only if I add lines to the build prop i can make it work, because my carriers aren't on the google list, even though the carriers have VOLTE service.
09:44:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I think you have a misconception regarding how it works
09:45:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Possibly! The key idea is that stock doesn't work, and the roms that do have it working for me have this added:https://pastebin.com/7bP8HFB2
09:45:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> On GrapheneOS, after you enable the "LTE-only" mode it completely disables 2g, 3g, etc.
09:46:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Therefore you either get VoLTE working, or it just won't work at all
09:46:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> Yes sir, my question is why does it work when I add the above code
09:47:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Idk, I'm not knowledgeable enough
09:47:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Anyway, just go ahead and try it out)
09:47:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Many carriers don't provide a proper VoLTE service
09:48:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I wonder if it's something that can be added to graphene, but since I am no expert, this may be bad in terms of usability or security or something. But generally speaking, the Apple list of "ims enabled" carriers is much more complete than googles. I wonder why Google is allowing themselves to be behind in that area.
09:49:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> AFAIK, you don't need to change anything in GrapheneOS to get a working VoLTE (given that your carrier provides this service)
09:51:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Except that you can turn on "LTE-only" mode, but this can be done in settings after successful installation
09:52:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​ix5000> I'll play around with it later today, thanks!
12:21:36 <chris38> having issues installing graphene on pixle 4, can some one help
12:22:21 <missfire[m]> chris38: hey, could you elaborate? in which step do you struggle?
12:23:43 <chris38> yes, when i click the flash icon inside the platformtools folder the cmd flash's up then closes, the phone is unlocked, and image files coppyied to the same folder,
12:24:03 <chris38> the one thing i did notice is that the platform folder is missing a 'lib' folder??
12:24:09 <chris38> could this be why
12:25:16 <chris38> and thank you for responding

16:25:51 <hasenov> Hi I have an issue with DNS, it seems that graphene is using 8.8.8.8 as my default DNS rather than the one coming from my dhcp server
16:26:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that's not true
16:26:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the default has always been "automatic"
16:26:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you (or people around you) probably changed the setting

17:17:40 <somenerd[m]> what?
17:17:51 <somenerd[m]> source?
17:18:48 <caleb[m]1> I think their point is that it's proprietary and has the capability to talk to stuff like the Modem ( in theory ?) without us (the kernel) knowing about it
17:19:59 <somenerd[m]> I mean, there's really no proof of it
17:20:24 <caleb[m]1> No, there isn't
17:21:09 <james87623> Hello, I have a question about the App Permissions settings control in GrapheneOS. I see there is the option to deny access to Sensors. What exactly does this do? I denied sensor access to a pedometer app and it was still able to track my steps. What sensors does this permission block? Thanks for the help!
17:24:40 <somenerd[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/34591c642903d77f15a92f77c139d8b52d32d266
17:24:59 <somenerd[m]> it's for other sensors not already covered under the "body sensors" permission
17:25:21 <somenerd[m]> (the app might have counted your steps using the body sensors)
17:27:13 <james87623> Thanks for the info. I denied every permission I could in the permissions settings and it was still counting steps. Is there a different area to deny access to body sensors?
17:28:59 <somenerd[m]> https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#BODY_SENSORS
17:29:04 <somenerd[m]> I think that you can't
17:29:09 <somenerd[m]> (install time permission)
17:29:13 <somenerd[m]> I'm not too sure though
17:30:19 <somenerd[m]> actually, I'm not sure about how the app recorded the permission
17:31:30 <somenerd[m]>  * actually, I'm not sure about how the app recorded the steps
17:32:34 <james87623> Ok. If I must use an app that I do not trust, say a Covid tracking app, would it be safe to install it in a separate user profile and only open that profile when I am required to show proof of the app?
17:32:57 <james87623> If the profile session has ended, will any apps in that profile have access to network, sensors, or anything?
17:33:06 <somenerd[m]> apps are already sandboxed from each other
17:33:53 <james87623> I'm not asking about app isolation. I need to know how to have an untrusted app installed and completely disabled unless I have to run it.
17:36:15 <james87623> If I am forced to install a work or government surveillance app on my phone, would installing it on a separate user be a safe way of accomplishing that? Or do I not understand what you meant about app sandboxing? I am trying to prevent an app from running in the background without my explicit consent.
17:36:17 <GhostSplinterSix> I wouldn't install an untrusted app, especially something like contact tracing on an OS like GrapheneOS. That defeats the purpose of using an OS like it.
17:36:53 <james87623> If I had the option to not install it I would not be asking these questions. I must install it and must show proof of the app from time to time.
17:37:05 <somenerd[m]> > I wouldn't install an untrusted app, especially something like contact tracing on an OS like GrapheneOS. That defeats the purpose of using an OS like it.
17:37:05 <somenerd[m]> no it really doesn't
17:37:17 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS is meant to provide a secure and private OS

Or do I not understand what you meant about app sandboxing? I am trying to prevent an app from running in the background without my explicit consent.
17:37:38 <somenerd[m]> I'm trying to find an answer
17:37:53 <james87623> Thanks!
17:38:01 <somenerd[m]> I believe that the app does stop and get disabled, but I want to confirm it
17:38:30 <caleb[m]1> I think it should be possible to prevent an app from running in the background
17:38:33 <caleb[m]1> AT least, in theory
17:39:09 <somenerd[m]> > I think it should be possible to prevent an app from running in the background
17:39:09 <somenerd[m]> I believe that Android 12 introduces app freezing
17:40:24 <james87623> I'm specifically asking if an app on a separate user that is not running can collect ANY data and save it for a bulk upload when the profile is activated. I need  a way to install an tracking app, completely isolate/freeze/close/whateveryouwantocallit so it is not collecting any data unless I explicitly choose to launch it, like during a physical
17:40:24 <james87623> confrontation where I must show proof of the app and must show it functioning.
17:40:47 <helloworldkk87[m> All apps are sandboxed tho
17:41:09 <somenerd[m]> that's not what they're trying to ask
17:41:20 <helloworldkk87[m> Oh sorry
17:41:27 <somenerd[m]> they're asking if apps are still active, even if the profile session is ended
17:41:40 <helloworldkk87[m> Riight got ir
17:41:51 <somenerd[m]> > Support for logging out of user profiles without needing a device manager: makes them inactive so that they can't continue running code while using another profile and purges the disk encryption keys (which are per-profile) from memory and hardware registers
17:42:09 <somenerd[m]> the "end session" button should stop the code from running
17:43:36 <somenerd[m]> (Source: https://grapheneos.org/features)
17:43:50 <james87623> Thanks for the info. I did come across that on the GrapheneOS page. Is there any further information on this topic? I believe this is answering my question but I'd love a few more details on this if that is possible.
17:44:07 <somenerd[m]> I'd suggest looking around on logbot

17:45:20 <james87623> Nice, didn't know you could search past chats. thanks
17:48:12 <GhostSplinterSix> Welcome to GrapheneOS. I hope you enjoy it.
18:06:41 <james87623> somenerd[m] Found this on logbot:
18:06:41 <james87623> we encourage using user profiles as isolated workspaces but bear in mind profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox.
18:06:42 <james87623> Do you understand what he means by profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox?
18:07:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that was not too long ago
18:07:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> basically apps in GrapheneOS are already sandboxed
18:08:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> using separate profiles does not make them "more sandboxed" from each other
18:08:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no, still bad wording
18:08:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> please disregard my messages
18:10:08 <Superstig[m]> They're asking if the app would continue to collect data if the profile isn't in use.
18:10:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that question was answered tho
18:10:57 <kingkong22[m]> DO
18:11:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R​edeemedSonOfGodKJV> Can you folks tell me the best way to migrate from CalyxOS to GrapheneOS. Do I have to go back to stock pixel Android 11 or just install GrapheneOS over the top of CalyxOS? Any other words of wisdom for a 64 year old newb?
18:11:44 <kingkong22[m]> Does anyone know if the wide angle camera on the pixel 5 can be used with graphene?
18:12:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> simply following the web installer is all you need
18:13:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nothing extra afaik
18:14:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> my personal recommendation: don't try to backup-restore your apps and data. It is much better to reinstall all needed apps manually, and manually move the data you really need
18:15:30 <GhostSplinterSix> I agree.
18:15:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R​edeemedSonOfGodKJV> Call logs, text messages OK to back up to USB and restore?
18:16:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> idk, never did it before (cause never never needed to)
18:17:31 <Pratyush[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<RedeemedSonOfGodKJV> Can you fo"> imo you don't have to switch back to stock os simply because Graphene already include firmware and other stuff.
18:18:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R​edeemedSonOfGodKJV> I'm hoping the GrapheneOS experience is superior to the CalyxOS experience. Must be.
18:19:04 <Pratyush[m]> Please don't compare here. it's all up to you and your goal.

22:38:11 <lpppppp> Hello. Just wondering about Graphene OS detection. I'm assuming that it has a unique user agent - which due to the very small userbase makes you really stand out. Are there ways to globally change user-agent to appear like another device (samsung for ex)?
22:41:57 <akc3n[m]> lpppppp: please read:   https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers

22:49:15 <annochris> Hi, I have installed grapheneos but every time I turn on my phone I get the ' phone is booting with a different os ' message, then the google logo appears, then the grapheneos logo appears, plus it don't let me update the version in my settings?? Is this normal?? Thanks
22:50:26 <GhostSplinterSix> <annochris "Hi, I have installed grapheneos "> That's how it loads. If there's an update, it will update on its own. At least it did for me.
22:50:51 <annochris> So you also get the google logo very time?
22:51:04 <annochris> Before the grap logo?
22:51:55 <annochris> Every*
22:52:16 <GhostSplinterSix> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
22:52:32 <annochris> OK I'll check the link
22:52:58 <annochris> ><>` here's a fish your welcome
22:54:10 <GhostSplinterSix> It's a Google phone, so the logo will be there but that's it.
22:55:12 <annochris> OK so my graph is not hacked then, thanks for the info
22:55:54 <annochris> ><>` another fish, and thanks
22:57:03 <GhostSplinterSix> You're welcome.
23:00:28 <Thatcher[m]> If you don't like the Google logo, get an iPhone
23:02:25 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "If you don't like the Google log"> That's just...cruel.
23:03:44 <Thatcher[m]> I recommend iPhone for security and there is no Google logo when booting.
23:10:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R​edeemedSonOfGodKJV> "I recommend iPhone for security"???Surely you jest, sir! There is much baked in the iPhone hardware cake that you must not be aware of.
23:12:18 <akc3n[m]> annochris: you could do your own boot animation logo too, BTW as a side note.

23:14:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> iPhones are some of the most secure phones on the market.
23:19:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R​edeemedSonOfGodKJV> That is a matter of opinion, sir. Look up Rob Braxman on YouTube. He is an Internet security expert by profession for many years. He will not leave his office with his iPhone. The problems with iPhone security are on the hardware level. Do some research..or not.
23:20:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> Rob Braxman is an idiot.
23:20:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> He doesn’t know what he’s talking about
23:21:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> Any credible security researcher you can talk to will tell you the same.
