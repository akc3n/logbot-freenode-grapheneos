02:20:56 <nomada> hello, I just installed GrepheneOS yesterday on my Pixel 3 and it's feels pretty smooth so far... I read about some issues with the camera app but everything seems to be working very well.
02:23:44 <nomada> However, I'm noticing that some apps that uses location can't load properly, of course bc they use gMaps.
02:25:05 <nomada> So, I'm wondering... is it possible to install microG on GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3? I followed this guide to install it: https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/using-google-camera-on-grapheneos/ but I'm not sure what to do later. What app from the F-droid repository shoudl I download and what should I configure?
02:32:22 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I think you'd have to use calyx if you wanted microg
02:38:18 <nomada> ok. I read about using calix instead, as it's practically a graphene based OS + microg, is that right and how much difference it is in terms of the security config from grapheneos?
02:38:26 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <nomada "So, I'm wondering... is it possi"> It's possible to install, but it will break other apps in it (as they'd opt to use firebase cloud messaging and the apps will be unable to connect to it)
02:38:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <nomada "ok. I read about using calix ins"> It'a based on AOSP, and other OS discussons fit on offtopic room
02:40:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <nomada "So, I'm wondering... is it possi"> If you need Play services APIs, better off use stock OS for complete implementation
02:41:20 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's based on AOSP, and other OS discussons fit on offtopic room
02:52:02 <nomada> I don't want a complete implementation. Actually, i don't want any kind of implementation, but there are some apps that just don't work because they depend on Google Services, for example, to show a map when sharing location.
02:59:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s‚Äãabot7> I just finished installing with the webusb interface and locking the bootloader and now it seems to be stuck in a bootloop. google logo flashes then right back to the fasboot mode bootloader screen
02:59:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s‚Äãabot7> anybody had this issue before?
02:59:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> You can use the browser and open gmaps website to share location?
03:01:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s‚Äãabot7> when I boot into recovery mode it just goes to no command
03:01:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!„Ö§> https://signal.org/blog/cellebrite-vulnerabilities/
03:01:49 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (Not sure, haven't tried, and there's not really a solution as GrapheneOS don't support any implementation of Play services (which includes sharing location) https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services)
03:03:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hello @sabot7, it sounds like either the installation was interrupted before it was completed, or your USB connection to the phone (either the cable, or the USB slots on the host) may not have had complete functionality.
03:04:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s‚Äãabot7> thanks, I assume it's perma bricked now with the bootloader relocked?
03:04:08 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, not bricked at all. Start the process again.
03:04:21 <TheJollyRoger> Connect it and unlock it.
03:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, you must never interrupt the phone while "fastbootd" is displayed on the phone. During that time, data is being written to the system partition.
03:04:48 <TheJollyRoger> Interrupting it will cause this kind of thing to happen.
03:05:02 <TheJollyRoger> Even though it's showing a menu at that time.
03:05:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s‚Äãabot7> when I try to unlock the bootloader again I get access denied, should I try via the terminal method?
03:05:04 <nomada> I had the same issue, it seems that when unlocks happens, OEM debugging desactivates so you need to enter the system and activate again, and so on on loop. I solve it installing from command line
03:06:29 <nomada> yes @sabot7 try command line mode. It worked for me
03:06:43 <nomada> thanks for the help. bye bye
03:07:14 <TheJollyRoger> Very strange, since the webUSB method is generally much safer. It's a frontend for fastboot.js, anything the commandline tools can do, the web installer can do - if there's something the webinstaller can't do, then generally neither the commandline tools can't do it either.
03:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> But at this point, can't hurt to attempt it.

06:32:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Ken has joined the Telegram Group!
07:10:58 <Billi> hlo
08:54:49 <GhostSplinterSix> Good morning, all. What apps would you recommend for those who use GrapheneOS? I know a simple web search would be able to tell me, but I'd rather see what ya'll recommend.
09:19:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> What are your needs ?
09:23:17 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic / #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
09:51:01 <X58546753> Is there any way to get rid of the google logo that comes at boot right before the graphene logo so it doesn't still feel like you're a slave to google?
09:53:05 <Thatcher[m]> No
09:53:31 <j-james[m]> a 3x1 inch strip of electrical tape
09:53:48 <j-james[m]> not without recompiling, no
09:54:55 <X58546753> Recompiling how? Like what files would you have to change before compiling?
09:55:29 <Thatcher[m]> Many files
09:57:26 <Thatcher[m]> If it bothers you that much then just put a covid-19 mask over your eyes while the phone is booting up
09:57:55 <somenerd[m]> I'm not sure if that'd work
09:58:05 <somenerd[m]> afaik the Google logo is tied to the hardware
09:58:44 <X58546753> I mean is there really not a way to peek into the file system and remove the script thats responsible for displaying that? I mean its obviously pulling the image from somewhere
09:59:47 <Thatcher[m]> It's baked into the hardware of the phone, kind of like the bios image or logo when you start a pc
10:00:19 <somenerd[m]> I'm pretty sure there isn't a way to change it, since it's tied to the hardware
10:01:39 <X58546753> Ah that makes sense then if it's down at the bios level
10:01:47 <X58546753> Kinda like Apple
10:01:53 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
10:02:17 <Thatcher[m]> üçé
10:02:21 <j-james[m]> also, if it was a part of the os, you'd basically not be able to get updates
10:04:00 <X58546753> Cause it would change the signature?
10:05:28 <j-james[m]> yeah, exactly
10:06:47 <strcat[m]> X58546753: it's the UEFI boot splash
10:06:55 <strcat[m]> it varies based on hardware
10:07:02 <strcat[m]> it can't be a GrapheneOS logo without making our own hardware
10:10:58 <lvl1user> hi guys
10:11:20 <lvl1user> i tried to be as private as possible buying a new pixel 4a
10:11:47 <lvl1user> but unfortunately i was giving the seller my real tel. so now i am unsure if that could be a larger risk
10:12:19 <lvl1user> like how likely can he as an official buyer from google be tracked down if i am using the pixel 4a with grapheneOS ?
10:12:44 <strcat[m]> not clear what you're really concerned about
10:13:02 <strcat[m]> what 'risk' is there?
10:13:02 <lvl1user> i want to d oprivate things on the pixel 4a with grapheneOS
10:13:03 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense
10:13:07 <X58546753> Did you pay with credit card?
10:13:10 <lvl1user> no
10:13:17 <lvl1user> i bough used phone with cash
10:13:30 <lvl1user> but i was giving him my tel. Nr.
10:13:33 <strcat[m]> lvl1user: it is not clear what kind of risk you think there is
10:13:40 <somenerd[m]> what type of risk?
10:13:44 <strcat[m]> so, unless you're going to explain that further, it's off-topic for this channel
10:13:46 <strcat[m]> it does not make sense
10:13:55 <lvl1user> the Id from the device could be tracked by google who bought it no?
10:14:07 <strcat[m]> what?
10:14:13 <j-james[m]> grapheneos doesn't communicate unique device indicators (more than what's required for ip), iirc
10:14:16 <strcat[m]> really not clear what you're talking about
10:14:17 <somenerd[m]> what id?
10:14:27 <lvl1user> imei or soemthing
10:14:42 <strcat[m]> every phone has an IMEI for their cellular radio
10:14:51 <strcat[m]> why is that relevant? what are you actually concerned about?
10:15:04 <j-james[m]> but even then, yeah, i wouldn't think that would constitute a security risk
10:15:04 <lvl1user> ok short question : How much can i trust graphene to not leak anything which could lead to the original buyer of the pixel 4a phone ?
10:15:13 <strcat[m]> are you going to be using the cellular network? in that case, I assume you have a cellular plan?
10:15:25 <strcat[m]> lvl1user: it's really not clear what you're talking about
10:15:40 <lvl1user> i maybe use 4g yes but i would use an anonymous sim card from croatia or something not linked to a name
10:15:49 <strcat[m]> lvl1user: if you do not think they are a sophisticated attacker tampering with the hardware before sending it to you like putting a malicious touchscreen into the phone... what are you concerned about?
10:15:50 <X58546753> Who has your number google or some random guy
10:16:12 <lvl1user> some rqndom guy who would be the last station to tzrack as he bough the phone with credit card from google
10:16:31 <strcat[m]> still not really clear what you're worried about
10:16:36 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that Google's going to target users specifically tbh
10:17:00 <X58546753> Then you're fine the problem wouldn't be graphene
10:17:21 <strcat[m]> somenerd: 'target users'? what's the relevance to how they're buying a phone?
10:17:26 <lvl1user> ok if i do something on the internet, which is considered illegal or something and some agency trying to catch me ... i have nothing to leak as i am never giving my name to any service connected to the device
10:17:46 <X58546753> No they don't use data from craigslist
10:17:48 <lvl1user> so my question is if its somehow possible to track it down to the original buyer of the phone
10:17:57 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: 'target users'? what's the relevance to how they're buying a phone?
10:17:57 <somenerd[m]> I'm not understanding what they're trying to say
10:18:07 <somenerd[m]>  * > somenerd: 'target users'? what's the relevance to how they're buying a phone?
10:18:07 <somenerd[m]> I'm trying to understanding what they're trying to say
10:18:43 <X58546753> If you used it to do something serious like murder then yeah it would be traced down
10:18:51 <strcat> what would be traced down?
10:19:05 <lvl1user> so how far can they come ?
10:19:12 <X58546753> His phone number he gave over craigslist
10:19:14 <strcat> X58546753: if you're going to say something like that here, you'll need to explain what you mean
10:19:37 <strcat> X58546753: how the hell would they have that?
10:19:58 <X58546753> They would get a warrant for the message log on Craigslist
10:20:19 <strcat> you're making a huge leap in logic that they know something came from craigslist
10:20:26 <strcat> and which message was involved in selling it
10:20:27 <X58546753> He told us
10:20:40 <strcat> they're some random irc user
10:20:52 <strcat> please just drop the topuic
10:20:54 <strcat> topic*
10:21:01 <strcat> it's off-topic and what people are saying here does not make sense
10:21:40 <lvl1user> i make it easier for you: How anon is graphene ?
10:22:59 <strcat> we have lots of docs on the site
10:23:04 <strcat> it seems you haven't read those
10:23:23 <strcat> you need to read the relevant sections of the FAQ, etc. before asking a question based on what wasn't answered by the site
10:23:37 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
10:23:48 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
10:23:56 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
10:24:18 <X58546753> I mean you have to configure it you cant just use it without setting everything up. Click through EVERY setting theres settings in settings
10:24:33 <strcat> X58546753: really not accurate
10:24:36 <strcat> the defaults are fine
10:25:21 <strcat> you do not have to do any configuration for it to be private and secure, you do have to not grant apps access to files and data you don't want them to have but that's about not doing something rather than doing something
10:25:37 <X58546753> All apps have access to sensors by default..
10:25:49 <lvl1user> ok thx i will read all the docs while installing
10:26:01 <somenerd[m]> > All apps have access to sensors by default..
10:26:02 <somenerd[m]> that's for compatibility
10:26:02 <lvl1user> is mac os catalina okay¬† too or just big sur?
10:26:04 <strcat> X58546753: only in the foreground and access to them is restricted
10:26:11 <somenerd[m]> same with network
10:26:21 <strcat> X58546753: not a privacy issue
10:26:47 <strcat> people overestimate what the network toggle achieves and miss that the actual privacy model is not granting the apps access to your sensitive data
10:26:53 <X58546753> Yeah it is? It means you're open to audio beacon cross device tracking?
10:27:02 <strcat> what?
10:27:13 <strcat> doesn't make sense
10:27:20 <strcat> apps don't have microphone access by default
10:27:27 <strcat> and I have no clue what you think network access has to do with it
10:27:46 <strcat> and microphone / sensors access only works in the foreground
10:27:48 <strcat> ever
10:27:54 <strcat> there is no way for it to work in the background
10:27:57 <somenerd[m]> audio beacon cross device tracking? there's already restrictions on this
10:28:20 <X58546753> https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2015/11/17/cross-device-tracking-via-imperceptible-audio-beacons-threatens-user-privacy/
10:28:46 <strcat> X58546753: I don't see the relevance to either of those permissions
10:28:49 <strcat> or any of the configuration
10:29:02 <somenerd[m]> doesn't work in the background
10:29:32 <somenerd[m]> so if you want to get tracked, you always have to keep the app in the foreground
10:29:50 <X58546753> https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/176566/content/Shetty_asu_0010N_16594.pdf
10:30:43 <strcat> sensors access is available in the foreground by default
10:30:47 <strcat> like iOS, Android, etc.
10:30:52 <m2tu[m]> I have longtime wondered what "Trusted credentials" are used for ?? I see forexample Buypass AS class 2 and class 3 certificates, and and Goverment Root certifications authority ??
10:31:04 <X58546753> Their backdoors
10:31:09 <strcat> m2tu[m]: you're welcome to go read about Web PKI
10:31:13 <strcat> and CAs
10:31:23 <m2tu[m]> is it secure to remove them ?
10:31:28 <X58546753> Yes
10:31:31 <strcat> you will break TLS connections
10:31:40 <somenerd[m]> "secure"?
10:31:44 <strcat> you can't remove CAs without breaking TLS (HTTPS)
10:31:46 <somenerd[m]> it'd probably break a lot of things
10:32:13 <X58546753> Iv'e removed them and I'm still alive
10:32:13 <strcat> apps can select the CAs they want to trust, or pin keys
10:32:25 <m2tu[m]> ok i see... so no one can be removed
10:32:36 <strcat> if you remove CAs you're breaking TLS connections to the servers using certificates issued from those
10:32:44 <m2tu[m]> i did in fact tryed once removed one and keyboard not worked anymore
10:32:50 <strcat> that doesn't make any sense
10:33:00 <strcat> has no impact on stuff like that at all...
10:33:19 <m2tu[m]> ok. so they are not backdoors , than its no problem having them
10:33:21 <strcat> you're making your own builds with a lot of changes, so you probably broke it another way
10:33:31 <j-james[m]> actually, out of curiousity, where would be a good place to learn about tls and general internet security?
10:33:35 <strcat> m2tu[m]: they are the CAs that are included by default
10:34:05 <strcat> the CA model is definitely seriously flawed but disabling them case-by-case is quite pointless
10:34:20 <strcat> ideally apps pin keys
10:34:30 <strcat> sites can pin keys too via TLSA records but browsers don't check it atm
10:35:14 <strcat> a sophisticated attacker only need Let's Encrypt
10:35:34 <m2tu[m]> hmm i see.. so they re mostly used for websurfing / webview
10:35:36 <X58546753> I mean it doesn't even matter what you change the hardware is already backdoored
10:36:28 <m2tu[m]> X58546753: it maight be but i dont think they use thopse backdoors to hunt normal users
10:36:39 <m2tu[m]> terrorist suspectes maby
10:36:44 <somenerd[m]> > I mean it doesn't even matter what you change the hardware is already backdoored
10:36:44 <somenerd[m]> what?
10:36:51 <GhostSplinterSix> Thank you, Strcat.
10:36:58 <strcat> I banned them, tired of their unsubstantiated claims and bad advice
10:37:16 <strcat> this is a place people rely on to get useful and accurate information
10:37:31 <strcat> not people's conspiracy theories and bad advice
10:37:42 <Thatcher[m]> <X58546753 "I mean it doesn't even matter wh"> I just checked the back of my phone and found no doors.
10:37:55 <m2tu[m]> Thatcher: haha
10:37:56 <strcat> people are asking for help and advice
10:38:08 <GhostSplinterSix> *tips hat* I'm not very tech savvy and enjoy hopping in here and learning from others.
10:38:15 <strcat> what they want is not security nihilism and concern trolling
10:38:52 <strcat> there is no perfect security and you always have to trust a certain subset of people involved in the supply chain (software, hardware) for the device
10:38:56 <somenerd[m]> and advice that could break stuff
10:39:03 <strcat> so deal with it and stop whining about it
10:39:13 <strcat> really don't see the point in unproductive security nihilism whining
10:39:19 <strcat> no place for it in either of the channels
10:39:36 <strcat> do it on twitter and maybe 4 people will follow you wanting to listen to it, not here
10:40:02 <m2tu[m]> btw.. i made a build especially meant to be used for cryptocurrencies... in which i did removed sdcard so the phone has no disk at all in theory... is this secure way ot can that breake any of encryuptinon?
10:40:17 <strcat[m]> m2tu: that's not what that means
10:40:22 <m2tu[m]> i cant save anything from web, nor even any fotos
10:40:43 <strcat[m]> most data is not stored in the profile's home directory
10:41:01 <strcat[m]> you disk not remove 'disk access' or whatever it is you're saying
10:41:12 <strcat[m]> it's not on-topic for the channel
10:41:18 <lvl1user> i must say the web install is really advanced shit , heads up guys this is futuristic :D
10:41:40 <m2tu[m]> ok
10:48:22 <strcat> and btw about the audio beacon stuff: there is not currently a permission for *playing audio* so it is not really addressed yet beyond turning off audio (for foreground apps at least, more research required into it)
10:49:24 <strcat> sensors access is usable as a very *crude* and *low frequency* microphone, but like camera and microphone access, sensors access is only ever permitted in the foreground
10:49:52 <strcat> if I did not have to spend so much time dealing with concern trolling, ban evasion, etc. we could have more privacy and security features to address more issues like better control over playing audio
10:50:00 <strcat> and I could write up more stuff for the documentation
10:50:18 <strcat> currently working on an important fix for the upstream INTERNET implementation
10:50:30 <strcat> any nonsense in this channel directly harms the project and the users of it
10:54:24 <lvl1user> sounds like a single point of failure:P
10:54:39 <lvl1user> but thx for the support in here :D
10:57:27 <strcat[m]> more people are welcome to contribute to the project
10:57:30 <strcat[m]> we're looking for more developers to hire
10:57:42 <strcat[m]> we have funding but a lack of people to hire with it
11:02:10 <Thatcher[m]> It really sucks that ban evaders and concern trollers get to ruin it for the rest of us by wasting your time. We really want to see the greatest potential of this project and your incredible work.
11:03:06 <Thatcher[m]> And dammit, if I could program, I'd be all over it
11:09:20 <hypergenesis[m]> strcat:  Are there any moderators that you could delegate the policing of the channel to so you can focus on more important things?
11:09:41 <hypergenesis[m]> I guess that answers my question
11:09:50 <somenerd[m]> lol
11:28:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Hi I posted this question yesterday but couldn't see a reply, does the user profiles compartmentalize like qubesos? So for example 5 profiles is like 5 seperate phones ?
11:29:13 <strcat> that's essentially how user profiles work
11:29:23 <strcat> they aren't separate OSes but they are isolated from each other that way
11:29:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l‚Äãp4678> Ok great that's what I wanted to clarify
11:30:10 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm brand new to GrapheneOS but once I'm familiar with it, I'll be more than happy to assist in whatever way I can.
11:37:59 <iccedlemontea[m]> Hey strcat  what skillset would be a great starting point for someone who wants to contribute to grapheneOS? (C/C++/kotlin/python/java? Android architecture knowledge? Etc etc)
11:38:32 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of different areas to contribute
11:38:49 <strcat[m]> you do not need a long list of skills to contribute
11:39:15 <strcat[m]> you don't need to be able to do work across a lot of the OS unless you expect to do device maintenance
11:40:19 <iccedlemontea[m]> I understand it may be a very general question, but ideally what would you say is the bare minimum of stuff the contributor must know?
11:40:52 <iccedlemontea[m]> What programming languages for example?
11:41:26 <strcat[m]> you do not need to know all the programming languages used by the OS to contribute to it
11:41:31 <strcat[m]> as I said above, there are many areas to contribute
11:41:37 <strcat[m]> you only need the relevant skills for the areas you contribute
11:42:20 <strcat[m]> you want a list of languages used throughout the project? you do not need to know all the languages used to contribute
11:42:22 <strcat[m]> not how it works
11:42:29 <strcat[m]> huge difference between contributing and maintaining the OS

11:44:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãandicraftsman> Ohai! Building graphene for qemu atm... If this will work, gonna try building it for my phone
11:45:56 <iccedlemontea[m]> Noted, thanks
11:46:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> gl hf)
11:46:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãandicraftsman> For 48 minutes already, because building on an Athlon 3000g haha
11:50:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãandicraftsman> My phone is Galaxy a30s btw, so this is why i am building the rom
11:56:07 <m2tu[m]> iccedlemontea: I have been checking the source code and learned to build Graphene , i can say that mostly are Java or XML that are relevant, i could make big changes on the of my experiments just by changing small piece of code !
11:57:36 <iccedlemontea[m]> Ah thanks for looking it up, i have some java/kotlin experience so i may be able to contribute
11:59:37 <m2tu[m]> i did not have any knowledge at all in java i can tell u that.. but with help of devs here they supported me . and after few weeks i got much more understanding.  I recomend u start building ur self so u can see a deeper view.
12:05:08 <strcat[m]> do not need to know/use Java or Kotlin to contribute
12:05:16 <strcat[m]> plenty of areas to contribute using other languages too
12:05:38 <strcat[m]> it's wrong to say you need to know a specific language to contribute
12:06:06 <strcat[m]> you can do work on C code, C++, Rust, Java, Kotlin, Rust and there is plenty outside the OS itself too including JavaScript, etc.
12:06:30 <strcat[m]> you do not need to know a list of things... you need to know what's relevant for the area you're contributing, and I assume you would choose the area based on your knowledge and interests
12:14:32 <GhostSplinterSix> Amen to that.
12:24:53 <njana[m]> I'm using Debian testion on my laptop. After successfully flasing graphene OS on pixel 5 I'm not able to transfer files via USB between my phone and laptop.
12:24:53 <njana[m]> To be more precise the laptop is not showing anything is connected.
12:24:53 <njana[m]> Can anyone help me out please. ?
12:25:58 <m2tu[m]> njana: U have to choose file transfer i guess
12:26:04 <m2tu[m]> on the phone screen
12:26:51 <njana[m]> m2tu I did that already but no luck.
12:27:14 <m2tu[m]> can u see the phone  with "lsusb"
12:27:39 <m2tu[m]> if not can try reconnect the cable
12:27:51 <m2tu[m]> or try diff usb port
12:28:27 <njana[m]> I can see the phone with lsusb.
12:30:23 <m2tu[m]> did it help to remove cable and reconnect it
12:32:32 <strcat[m]> njana: you need mtp support
12:37:14 <njana[m]> m2tu nope.
12:37:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> hello everyone how are yu doing ?
12:37:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> since i changed form android to grapheneos to my pixel 3a the headphone don t work anymore. does anyone has a clue why ?
12:38:04 <njana[m]> strcat: I've mtp selected on my phone? Is there anything to be done with my laptop?
12:38:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> also does anyone knows how i can replace the default photo application when i click on the button  ?
12:41:19 <strcat[m]> njana: yes, it needs to have support for mtp set up properly
12:41:24 <strcat[m]> macOS and Windows have that working out of the box
12:42:04 <strcat[m]> there's no default photo application
12:42:09 <strcat[m]> if you install another one it will ask you which one to use
12:42:15 <strcat[m]> there is a bundled one but it's not set as a default
12:42:27 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to change the home screen to your liking if that's what you're talking about
12:43:00 <strcat[m]> you'll need to give more details about the headphones, doubt it's related to GrapheneOS unless you're just confused by connecting new USB devices being disallowed when locked by default
12:44:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> strcat[m]> re:headphone it s the ones i got purchasing the pixel. i connect via usb c. i also have another set which was purchased alongside huawei p20. both work on the huawei  but none work on my pixel 3a since i changed to grapheneos
12:46:31 <strcat[m]> please read my response
12:47:31 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS does not permit connecting new USB devices while locked (with an exception at boot, since the user has not entered credentials yet, and has the option to reboot if their device was unattended)
12:48:07 <strcat[m]> you cannot connect USB headphones while locked, you need to unlock first, or have them connected from boot
12:48:17 <strcat[m]> you also cannot use analog USB-C headphones, only digital ones, since analog USB-C audio is not supported (same as the stock OS)
12:48:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Romain> oh thanks a lot
12:59:56 <rawtaz> hi
13:00:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> speedkills588 (@f‚Äãix5000) has joined the Telegram Group!
13:00:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãix5000> Is Graphene using the stock google VoLTE enabled carrier list?
13:01:17 <rawtaz> i have something that strikes me as odd. if im in a call on my grapheneos phone (updated automatically), then a lot of the times, i'd say at least 3 our of four times, when i get another incoming call, the call im currently in is cancelled and the new one starts rining (waiting for my accept). im very surprised that the current call is hung up, and havent found a setting for it.
13:01:54 <rawtaz> COULD it possibly be something like me hitting the power button when that other call comes in, and this hangs up the current call? thats the only thing i could thing of having happened, because i did accidentally hit that button last time it happened.
13:02:14 <rawtaz> otherwise, does anyone know why on earth the current call would be hung up right when another one comes in, and how to prevent that?
13:02:43 <b00n> Hi there, thanks a lot for that great OS, which I'm new to. I kindly wanted to ask, if you consider to introduce some kind of 'mobile data & wi-fi'-management, like CalyxOS seems to have introduced with their "Datura Firewall": https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/platform_packages_apps_Firewall This helps to modify the network connectivity (i. e. background
13:02:44 <b00n> data) of all installed apps on a single place, instead of of going through the properties app by app.
13:03:58 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> An app cannot restrict an internet access more than an integrated permission model in OS
13:06:51 <b00n> @DHFuchsiaOSwhen sure, I don't want more restrictions, just a more comfortable way to setting them.
13:11:11 <b00n> The description of the CalyxOS integrated "Firewall"-app is: "Makes the existing Wi-Fi / Mobile / VPN / Background data toggle easily accessible." I would love to see somethin' similar in GrapheneOS.
13:12:22 <nscnt[m]> b00n: And you don't think the Permission manager is enough?
13:12:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <b00n "Hi there, thanks a lot for that "> If you're referring to toggling all apps with Network permissions at once, it's not possible at the moment
13:12:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/503#issuecomment-799928315
13:13:08 <njana[m]> strcat: can you guide me on this? Since I'm a newbie.
13:17:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <b00n "data) of all installed apps on a"> Otherwise, Permission Manager is at settings > privacy > permissions manager > Network
13:17:50 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> As nscnt said
13:25:10 <b00n> Ah, thanks @nscnt[m] & @DHFuchsiaOSwhen for that hint (Permission Manager), I didn't knew. This seems to be a good equivalent.
14:11:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> njana[m]: please stop pinging mods/devs
14:12:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> there are some knowledgeable people here that can help you, but you should wait for help
14:12:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> pinging/distracting people from their lifes is not polite
14:18:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hulk let's not backseat mod here either
14:18:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> This don't ping devs is getting toxic
14:19:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yesterday I came from an alt as I had no access to matrix and some guy told me to stop pinging str cat
14:19:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> And let me be clear
14:19:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> How the hell do you expect to get a dev's attention without tagging them?
14:20:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you expect us to read the entire scrollback all the time?
14:20:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I know Daniel does that but a couple things to understand
14:20:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> If we do read the scrollback we're doing it when we are free
14:20:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> By then the user might even have left the channel
14:21:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> They need to tag us if they want our attention in that case
14:25:00 <entry1> I mean the guy is asking Daniel for a guide, plus for many questions the community can answer instead of a dev directly. We can give more context when saying to not ping devs for smaller issues. Also, how would anyone know that you were randomguy43? Why not just put your normal user under freenode? I get your point though, just putting that out there that it makes sense to not have everyone pinging Daniel all the time for
14:25:00 <entry1> simple questions. Agreed for things needing a dev's attention, it should be more than appropriate to ping
14:25:35 <lvl1user> lvl1user: is f-droid a good store to use ?
14:25:42 <lvl1user> is f-droid a good store to use ?
14:25:50 <lvl1user> and is it a good idea to use orbot for anonymous tor browsing?
14:26:04 <lvl1user> or is there a better solution?
14:26:17 <lvl1user> exposing ip (not doing anything) is a bad idea for privacy i guess
14:26:18 <rawtaz> people should absolutely not ping Daniel directly, unless they know that he's fine with them pinging him about that specific thing. for anything general that isnt something that he alone can answer, leave the man alone!
14:26:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> entry1: also discussion about moderation is off topic here
14:26:38 <rawtaz> that's basic logic and proper netiquette to not overload a project owner like this guy
14:26:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Apps usage are better off at off-topic room
14:27:15 <rawtaz> lvl1user: there's an #fdroid channel thats really good
14:27:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also rawtaz  there's a higher chance of some self proclaimed expert here accidentally giving wrong information
14:27:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <lvl1user "is f-droid a good store to use ?"> Not that great, but if you want to use it, Foxy Droid is a good minimal modern client
14:27:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then you'd waste development time by having the devs clear misinformation
14:28:54 <lvl1user> so whats the recommended way installing apps than ?
14:29:20 <rawtaz> anupritaisno1[m]: thats a risk thats lower than the chances of not burning out daniel and that others in here actually can help with most questions, so not pinging daniel and instead just asking whatever you want to know right here in the channel to the general public is still the right way to do it.
14:29:45 <m2tu[m]> lvl1user: i would use wireless LTE wireless router installing tor or vpn on it and connect to that if u dont trust ahvign apps installed
14:30:08 <rawtaz> anupritaisno1[m]: it's of course expected that people don't answer questions in a way that gives wrong answers. if theyre unsure about something but think they know then obviously they should say that "im not sure, but i *think* ... - but you need to make sure to verify this or take it with a grain of salt".
14:30:25 <rawtaz> this stuff works in every other channel, so it will of course work in here too.
14:30:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <lvl1user "so whats the recommended way ins"> Getting from the github releases is a way, or when you need Play store apps, Aurora Store (Network permission suffice there)
14:30:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Getting from the github releases"> But not a recommendation
14:30:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Just listing some ways
14:30:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> rawtaz: OK look here
14:30:53 <rawtaz> lvl1user: i only use fdroid to install apps on my phone :)
14:30:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't want anyone directly telling other people who not to tag
14:31:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> If there are any serious violations and repetitive tagging then you can go ahead
14:32:22 <rawtaz> anupritaisno1[m]: i dont think anyone is here to dictate so im with you on that :) all im saying is that everyone in here should realize that if they have questions, just ask them to the general public in the channel. if people ping daniel all the time, this will cause burnout in the end, and thats why one does not do that by default.
14:33:01 <rawtaz> in my experience not everyone understands that, especially those who arent regulars and that came her at some point and got help from daniel or whoever. they often ping that same person again next time :D
14:34:15 <lvl1user> m2tu[m]: so how do you install apps ?
14:34:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> lvl1user: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org also this is covered in the usage guide on our website
14:34:44 <lvl1user> its not that i dont trust installed apps but i want some more like elemnts for chatting or orbot for ip
14:35:09 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <anupritaisno1[m] "lvl1user: #grapheneos-offtopic:m"> #grapheneos-offtopic in freenode
14:38:55 <Alain[m]> Hi. Anyone here knows if GrapheneOS is using ZRAM for the swap space?
14:39:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Alain[m] "Hi. Anyone here knows if Graphen"> Yes. We are using zram
14:39:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why
14:39:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> We only change security related stuff
14:40:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> We leave stuff like zram that google added untouched
14:41:19 <Alain[m]> Good to know.
14:41:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've seen manufacturers create a swapfile on /data too sometimes
14:41:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> If they do that, we aren't removing it
14:42:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless there's a security issue with how it was done
14:43:09 <chile09[m]> Are there any steps that can be taken to further harden GrapheneOS?
14:43:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
14:43:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos is secure out of the box
14:44:17 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> and private as well
14:44:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> The only thing you might want to change is turning off native debugging if you want to
14:50:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: Pixels use zram + zram writeback
14:50:52 <strcat[m]> pages that are in zram for an entire day without anything using them get written out to zram writeback (once per day)
14:51:27 <chile09[m]> How to turn off native debugging
14:52:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> AFAIK, step one is to build the OS yourself (cause I don't think there's a toggle for that)
14:53:17 <lvl1user> what do you mean by graphene is private by default ? having clear ip adresses isn#t that private no ?
14:53:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> No "home calling"
14:54:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Also, you're asking many questions that have proper well-written answers on the main website
14:55:34 <nscnt[m]> <chile09[m] "How to turn off native debugging"> Settings > Security > Enable native code debugging
14:55:39 <nscnt[m]> only available for owner user
14:56:20 <timetravelingman> So what was the deal with the internet permission on a secondary profile issue?
14:56:40 <timetravelingman> What was happening
14:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: Pixels use zram +"> Ah yeah I keep forgetting
15:03:30 <Cliff[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Getting from the github releases"> You mean directly getting apks from github? Whats the downside of using f-droid store on graphene in your opinion?
15:07:07 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> mostly their practices on app building (the v1 signature issue will get fixed soon for all targetSdk), and outdated APIs and targetSdk on client side
15:12:26 <Alain[m]> Here's a question for which I can't find an answer on the main website: is anyone maintaining a list of apps that won't work without play services?
15:14:40 <timetravelingman> Google techlore plexus project
15:14:54 <timetravelingman> Or duckduckgo search that
15:16:04 <GhostSplinterSix> That's quite the task to compile...
15:18:46 <Alain[m]> Maybe some list that grows over time, maintained by the community, would be useful.. Like what winehq is doing for example.
15:19:09 <Alain[m]>  * Maybe some list that grows over time, maintained by the community, would be useful. Like what winehq is doing for example.
15:28:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Pretty much, personally prefer to have somebody else to handle it though, not some third party
16:35:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> whorrible (@w‚Äãhorrible) has joined the Telegram Group!
18:08:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Gui Do (@G‚ÄãuiDoPro) has joined the Telegram Group!
18:26:27 <princemachiavell> <Alain[m] "Here's a question for which I ca"> Yes. Search plexus. It's not super complete but it's OK.
18:33:09 <helloworldkk87[m> Some of the data on Plexus is wrong tho.. Like it says snapchat works with microg but yeah you can open the app and "use" it but you cant actually make an account or log in:D
18:45:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> You can !
18:45:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I was able to get it working
18:46:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Using microg on a shelter work profile it worked
18:47:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I can't remember well but I think I had to download an older version of snapchat and it did the trick
18:47:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!„Ö§> I use Snapchat without Microg
18:47:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!„Ö§> Signed in fine.
18:47:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> There is some luck to it
18:58:44 <doktorzhivago[m]> Are there any nice open source skins/themes for grapheneos?
19:02:21 <ananteris[m]> Anyone been able to get orbot working on gos?
19:08:24 <Pratyush[m]> <doktorzhivago[m] "Are there any nice open source s"> there is a pull request on github related to theme support expect proper first party theme support soon, within next months update may be.
19:11:33 <TheJollyRoger> antholop[m]: Orbot has been tested and is fully working on GrapheneOS.
19:15:29 <dnull> I've yet to have an issue with it yet
19:15:30 <TheJollyRoger> No missing features, no broken functionality, no crashes, works fine.
19:33:23 <njana[m]> Guys, what is your review on Calyx VPN?
19:33:23 <njana[m]> Do they collect any data like all other free VPNs.
19:34:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> off-topic
19:43:59 <flashdance> Just popping in here to say the web installer is very cool
19:57:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Welcome on-board!
20:16:39 <flashdance> Interesting, I also ran into this issue (https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210421#c7715080) with the web installer and the stock pixel charging cable (usb-c to usb-c). Switching to a third-party usb-a to usb-c cable (same fix identified earlier) resolved the issue. I am running an unsupported OS so maybe it's related to that.
20:17:28 <flashdance> is it worth opening up a github issue with steps to reproduce, or is that going to waste everyone's time?
20:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hi flashdance, glad to hear you solved the problem. It's only worth it if you can precisely reproduce the issue and know exactly what's causing it on your specific hardware.
20:18:12 <flashdance> My brain is not big enough for that
20:18:31 <flashdance> I appreciate you getting back to me though!
20:18:41 <TheJollyRoger> It's likely that one of your USB-C slots are broken in some way; this could range to one of the pins or traces being not properly wired, to defective firmware on your platform.
20:18:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, anytime! Glad to hear problem's solved, welcome aboard the ship!
20:19:12 <flashdance> Yeah, I figured it might be something obscure, clearly its not impacting most users and I'm running opensuse which isn't even officially supported
20:19:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
20:19:59 <TheJollyRoger> flashdance: it's likely this is no fault of your own, the issue is that USB is the wild west.
20:20:08 <flashdance> Yee-haw!
20:20:56 <TheJollyRoger> Them thar vendors ain't consistent batch to batch. Everyone of them durn does it their own ways!
20:22:11 <Thatcher[m]> Yarr
20:22:32 <flashdance> Do you work for this project? or is it mostly volunteers?
20:22:36 <TheJollyRoger> So all y'all will get sumthin' that'll work right summa the time, an' the other ain't gonna work no matter what y'all do to the durn thing.
20:22:43 <TheJollyRoger> Thatcher[m]: Ahoy shipmate!
20:22:50 <flashdance> I appreciate the piracy.
20:23:34 <TheJollyRoger> flashdance: I definitely don't work for GrapheneOS. All of the people at GrapheneOS, the lead developer included, are volunteers.
20:24:02 <flashdance> Yeah, figured the github sponsor revenue wasn't enough for salaries :)
20:24:32 <TheJollyRoger> There's one exception: occasionally, funds will be used to put out as "Feature Bounties", which is something like "if you submit and maintain this code, you can win this cryptocurrency."
20:24:45 <TheJollyRoger> Which has worked great in the past, and there might be more in the works later.
20:25:14 <flashdance> I only accept DOGE. Truly, a cryptocurrency that is innovative.
20:25:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha!
20:25:39 <flashdance> I feel like that joke was funnier when people weren't getting ruined from DOGE
20:25:54 <flashdance> Certainly didn't expect that on my 2021 bucket list.
20:26:36 <flashdance> Anyways, you all have a good one.
20:26:40 <TheJollyRoger> Everyone who contributes to the project is a volunteer. The reasons vary from person to person, but generally it's a combination of a few different ones: originally the lead developer wanted to have something he could use for his own personal use, and many of the other volunteers see the same value in contributing to GrapheneOS as a way to get stuff they want added to something they also make
20:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> use of. Some do it for ideology, to have freedom, security and privacy.
20:26:44 <TheJollyRoger> *in mobile devices
20:26:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, if you've got to run, fare thee well, shipmate. Return anytime you like!
20:27:48 <flashdance> Oh, I don't have to run. Just feel like I'm getting a bit off topic.
20:27:57 <TheJollyRoger> Ah! Got it!
20:28:13 <flashdance> I really do believe in this project, I had a copperhead pixel 2 in the past but had to get a refund after the schism.
20:28:36 <TheJollyRoger> Wow, you've been around since the early days, welcome back!
20:28:58 <flashdance> Yeah I had the pleasure of getting into an argument several years ago with strncat on reddit
20:29:09 <TheJollyRoger> My own reasons for staying with the project are that I've made a lot of friends here and while I may not have the technical skills to contribute source code yet, but I like to help answer questions and greet people when they come into the IRC channel.
20:29:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha!
20:29:17 <flashdance> When the librem 5 was announced I was fanboying pretty hard, and he brought me down to earth lol
20:29:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, I did the same XD (mine was Black Phone 2)
20:29:48 <flashdance> Those are great reasons
20:30:10 <flashdance> Yeah there's lots of security theatre out there
20:30:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
20:30:37 <GhostSplinterSix> I was going to buy a Librem 5 lol
20:31:01 <flashdance> I pre-ordered 1 day one lmfao
20:31:08 <flashdance> I actually have it lying around somewhere
20:31:14 <TheJollyRoger> XP Wow
20:31:19 <flashdance> (It is not a usable phone)
20:31:28 * Cliff[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/dCHfSdcuUbVbJJZkgIhyVTnL/message.txt >
20:31:28 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
20:31:33 <flashdance> But it is an interesting project. It's just not what it's hyped to be.
20:31:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
20:32:04 <GhostSplinterSix> They are still trying to fulfill the backer orders, so I know that I wouldn't get mine for a long time.
20:32:41 <flashdance> I had to wait a few years for mine
20:33:16 <GhostSplinterSix> You must be a patient person lol
20:35:26 <TheJollyRoger> In the future, ideally what we'd like to do would be to get an ODM to produce us something built on a Qualcomm reference platform. Something off the shelf.
20:35:43 <flashdance> I'm not a patient person. It was hell.
20:36:10 <flashdance> I know the lead dev is Canadian, same for you all?
20:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> Since the Pixels are close to Qualcomm reference devices. Google may be abandoning Qualcomm for greener pastures though, so we'll see what changes happen.
20:36:43 <GhostSplinterSix> <flashdance "I know the lead dev is Canadian,"> I'm in the US. West Virginia.
20:37:08 <flashdance> Very cool. I'm in the glorious capital of canada.
20:37:41 <Thatcher[m]> Take me home
20:37:43 <TheJollyRoger> I'm also a very proud Canadian, but the rest of the developers are from all around the world. GrapheneOS doesn't actually have and never had a physical office, our Github organization and the IRC channels are essentially a virtual office.
20:37:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, cool!
20:38:07 <GhostSplinterSix> Nice. Nice. I grew up right outside of my country's capital, hah.
20:38:19 <flashdance> Yeah, super cool project!
20:38:32 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "Take me home"> Country road. üòÅ
20:38:34 <flashdance> Okay, I'm going to go and transfer my signal backup to my new phone
20:38:40 <flashdance> Wish me luck
20:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
20:38:45 <Thatcher[m]> Mountain momma
20:38:54 <Thatcher[m]> Haha
20:38:56 <TheJollyRoger> That shouldn't be hard!
20:39:26 <faxing[m]> Looking at carriers and wondering if anyone has any information on Visible on GrapheneOS?
20:39:29 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm waiting for T-Mobile to call so that we can activate my Pixel 4a that has GrapheneOS installed on it. üòéüëçüèª
20:39:42 <faxing[m]> I know they didn't work when I switched a while back, but just asking if anything's changed
20:40:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hey faxing[m], I don't know yet, but I think some other people here might be able to answer you, fingers crossed.
20:40:14 <GhostSplinterSix> <Thatcher[m] "Mountain momma"> ü•∞‚ù§
20:58:37 <faxing[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hey faxing, I don't know yet, bu"> Alright, thanks
21:09:20 <GhostSplinterSix> What apps do y'all recommend for GrapheneOS?
21:09:58 <noax8[m]> F-droid apps
21:10:27 <noax8[m]> And most of the repositories in F-droid too
21:10:53 <GhostSplinterSix> I've been recommend the following: Bromite, Firefox, Vanadium, Vinyl music player, Infinity/Redreader, Nextcloud, Snapdrop, Newpipe, Blokada, Shelter, Access dots, Molly, Simple Calendar, Book Reader and KeepassDX.
21:12:02 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm brand new to GrapheneOS, so I thought I'd get a few more opinions.
21:13:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I've been recommend the followin"> Avoid Firefox, the other browsers are good, Newpipe and nextcloud are good, idk about the others
21:14:29 <GhostSplinterSix> Noted. Thanks for the reply.
21:15:14 <skwisgaar[m]> GhostSplinterSix: you want to avoid shelter as well, many people find it useful but it is not a great idea for security. Would recommend searching the chat for a good explanation of why that is.
21:16:28 <skwisgaar[m]> I use keepass and infinity, both are good apps
21:18:04 <GhostSplinterSix> Awesome. I appreciate it.
21:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hi GhostSplinterSix, Signal is definitely a must-have, or you can run Molly as some have suggested. Avoid Gecko based browsers like Firefox, because Firefox has chosen to take an "all-your-eggs-one-basket" approach, and does not internally sandbox, the way Chromium does, and Vanadium improves upon.
21:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> If you need a 2FA One Time Password App, consider looking into Aegis, and for E-mail, FairEmail works great, it's updated very often and the maintainer is really on the ball with keeping it up to date.
21:28:24 <TheJollyRoger> Although AOSP Camera has been getting better, OpenCamera does offer more features than it does and takes better quality pictures. If you want to avoid Zoom, Jitsi works great.
21:29:37 <vdge[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I've been recommend the followin"> Don't use access dots. It requires accessibility permission which is really dangerous.
21:42:30 <GhostSplinterSix> TheJollyRoger vdge I'm about to fire up my Pixel 4a with T-Mobile. Can y'all repost your message once I'm back in here?
21:44:39 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
21:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> Or I can link you to the logbot!
21:46:34 <TheJollyRoger> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210422#c7738577
21:55:05 <Alain[m]> Can apps using maps be tricked to believe they are available, or are there alternatives?
22:05:49 <dazinism> Alain: you mean using Google Maps?  It does run on Graphene. Guess your app may need Play Services as well, so still may not function.
22:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Alain[m], the answer is "it depends." If the app simply checks for the existence of another app, then quite possibly it might be doable to implement a stub API that returns "yes, this app is present." In the future, GrapheneOS would like to stub out the Play Services API that would tell apps "Yes, Google Play is here, but 502 error: Google's servers are offline." However, if that app
22:05:51 <TheJollyRoger> legitimately has a need to use the APIs provided by or communicate with the other app, then that's not possible without it there, is it?
22:06:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, good to know that, dazinism!
22:06:47 <dazinism> I'm pretty sure people have installed it, not tried myself.
22:07:31 <dazinism> Alain: the other thing you could try is see if the service also has a website you could use, rather than the app.
22:08:26 <Alain[m]> Yeah, I can do that for the weather radar map I used to.
22:12:30 <Alain[m]> I guess I'll look for alternatives using OpenStreetMap.
22:14:58 <Alain[m]> BTW, my cli installation from archlinux went like a breeze.
22:25:56 <GhostSplinterSix> So...this is what it feels like to be degoogled...üòé
22:31:39 <ananteris[m]> TheJollyRoger: weird.. VPN mode doesnt work for my orbot
22:31:53 <ananteris[m]> Instantly turns itself back off when I try to use it
22:34:55 <southron[m]> Do you have a VPN running in another profile?
22:39:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Only Jesus Saves - John 14:6 KJV (@R‚ÄãedeemedSonOfGodKJV) has joined the Telegram Group!
22:42:31 <Alain[m]> Is there an alternative to Google Pay or is this considered an evil thing to use on a smart phone?
22:43:58 <Alain[m]>  * Is there an alternative to Google Pay or is this considered an evil thing to use on a smart phone (and it very well  may be...)?
22:44:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <R‚ÄãedeemedSonOfGodKJV> I'm about to transition to GrapheneOS from CalyxOS tonight. I'm aware of the microg difference. Anything else I should be aware of? I am planning on going to the Android 10-based version of GrapheneOS because I need my vzw visual voicemail to text to absolutely work. Anything I should know about this being fixed on the current version of GrapheneOS or any other caveats before I jump?
22:50:59 <faxing[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I've been recommend the followin"> Switch
22:51:00 <faxing[m]> other than that it seems ok
23:06:26 <Thatcher[m]> faxing why not Molly?
