00:12:09 <k4n30[m]> Happy to be corrected by someone who knows more
00:19:04 <etksf[m]> any chance grapheneOS will add the feature "tap to sleep"? basically double-tap the notifications/status bar to turn off the screen and lock the phone.
00:20:23 <etksf[m]> it's a useful feature in lineageOS
00:41:51 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound particularly useful and we'd rather use gestures for more useful things
00:42:42 <strcat[m]> don't get how that's more convenient than pushing the button
00:43:09 <strcat[m]> makes more sense to use a gesture to do something that cannot trivially be done another way
00:44:44 <Golli162IQinform> What're your thoughts on something like pressing the power button 5 times quickly to emergency shutdown the device?
00:46:35 <entry1[m]> <Golli162IQinform "What're your thoughts on somethi"> Just soliciting my opinion, but you can shut off the device in under 2 seconds normally. Seems rather trivial to add imo
00:55:30 <strcat[m]> there's already a double press action we'd have to remove to support that
00:55:57 <strcat[m]> it could be done when holding down the button for 5 seconds or something like that
01:06:27 <phone[m]> i find holding the power button down and tapping shutdown to be more dexterity-friendly than hitting the power 5x.  that reminds me of turning on a vape box and missing a rapid-press
01:30:43 <M647509735485097> the shutdown prompt literally appears less than a second after holding the power button
04:39:27 <etksf[m]> <strcat[m] "doesn't sound particularly usefu"> years ago there was a design flaw with the nexus 5 phones where the cable connected to the power button would wear out. so then the user couldn't power on/off their phone anymore.
04:40:11 <etksf[m]> * years ago there was a design flaw with the nexus 5 phones where the cable connected to the power button would eventually wear out. so then the user couldn't power on/off their phone anymore.
04:40:11 <etksf[m]> having a tap to sleep helps mitigate that kind of wear and tear
04:41:28 <etksf[m]> and its not like it would wear out after > 5 years or anything. in my case it wore out after less than 2 years
04:44:55 <etksf[m]> point is minimizing use of moving parts will, in general, extend the life of a device

08:46:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> etksf[m]: I had the same thoughts about this issue when I first installed GOS
08:47:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but later on i realized that a feature like a "double tap to sleep" is not a priority, nor does it improve the security of a phone (if not makes it worse)
08:49:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> after pressing the physical power button, you can be sure that your device is locked (given you set a pin/password) without looking at it
08:52:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> while the double tap to sleep feature requires you to look at your phone (or at least hear the locking sound, which is not very loud) in order to make sure that your device is locked
08:54:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Longevity of a phone is not the goal of GrapheneOS, security is (longevity is the goal of LineageOS)

16:17:57 <strcat[m]> we do, exec spawning
16:18:11 <daiyomon[m]> but it adds 1 second to opening times
16:18:12 <daiyomon[m]> right
16:18:13 <strcat[m]> it's a secure spawning mode for applications
16:18:14 <strcat[m]> no
16:18:15 <strcat[m]> it doesn't
16:18:22 <strcat[m]> that's misinformation spread by people who attack the project with dishonest claims
16:18:27 <daiyomon[m]> ü§î
16:18:28 <strcat[m]> it adds ~150ms to cold start app spawning time
16:18:36 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 3a uses old eMMC memory, which is slower and inefficient. It's only really noticeable on the 3a.
16:18:40 <strcat[m]> ask the many people who use the OS here
16:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> On the 3, and 4, I don't even notice the difference.
16:19:02 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <TheJollyRoger "The Pixel 3a uses old eMMC memor"> And even then, it's not that long
16:19:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
16:19:12 <themadsloth1[m]> Its not very noticeable on the 4a, what I use

16:19:30 <TheJollyRoger> But the 3 and 4 have more modern SoCs, and the 4a uses a proper SSD rather than eMMC.
16:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> People complained to Google that the eMMC in the 3a was hamstringing the phone's performance, which is why they ditched that for the newer -a series phones after the 3a.

16:24:47 <TheJollyRoger> It's a gross misrepresentation of Exec spawning, using a specific handset that had issues - such as use of eMMC - that aren't related to GrapheneOS.
16:24:54 <strcat[m]> you aren't going to find a YouTube video explaining the privacy/security features we offer
16:25:09 <strcat[m]> and yes, some of those features require using extra memory or CPU time in order to offer substantially better privacy/security
16:25:11 <TheJollyRoger> In other words, the circumstances for it were specifically and selectively hand-picked.
16:25:24 <strcat[m]> our exec spawning model fixes serious security issues with the standard spawning model along with privacy issues
16:25:29 <strcat[m]> it is more than worth it
16:25:35 <strcat[m]> and it's one small feature among many
16:25:36 <TheJollyRoger> Then presented as fact across the entire family of devices.
16:25:44 <hypokeimenon[m]> There are good explanations of the features and enhancements in past conversations in this channel which you can search with logbot

17:14:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <u‚Äãlmirdin> I get full 2 days, depends on how you use it.
17:15:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> It depends on how many background apps are running on the device.
17:15:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <u‚Äãlmirdin> Check apps running in the background, cpu intensive apps, etc.
17:15:44 <stubbornant[m]> The notifications not showing signal message previw on lock screen for signal is driving me nuts. Does anybody know how to show the preview when the phone is locked?
17:16:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <u‚Äãlmirdin> Search for 'show sensitive notifications' in the settings.

17:26:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <u‚Äãlmirdin> Tor is a specific tool with a specific purpose. It should not be used for casual day-to-day browsing.

17:30:36 <strcat[m]> please look above, and don't needlessly repeat the discussion
17:30:39 <strcat[m]> it's not 'competition'
17:30:46 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is a privacy/security hardening project

17:31:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> @ulmirdin It is "ducking".
17:31:12 <baldgeek123[m]> Ah they are uninstalled apps
17:31:33 <strcat[m]> you could call Copperhead competition (although they primarily just take out code), or perhaps iOS, but I don't see how it applies to them for anyone who actually understands the purpose of GrapheneOS
17:31:35 <ultimateextras[m> I actually did look it up, but it seems to be a tough find to find anyhting that isn't just "It's super secure and google-free" so I figure why not ask the community?
17:31:44 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features

17:35:31 <ultimateextras[m> strcat: I actually did also look at CalyxOS, but it reads a bit too much like a Mozilla Ad to make any real sense of. With that in mind, what are the differences between GrapheneOS and CalyxOS?
17:36:16 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m], ultimateextras[m I'll handle this inquiry.
17:36:17 <strcat[m]> already answered multiple times above
17:36:19 <strcat[m]> please stop
17:36:22 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, okay.
17:36:39 <strcat[m]> "ultimateextras" Don't invite me to your rooms, I'll leave. [CERTIFIED PEDOSLAYER]: did you look at the answers above, from before when you asked?
17:36:48 <strcat[m]> just so you're aware, this doesn't come across as genuine
17:37:19 <strcat[m]> did you look at https://grapheneos/features ?
17:38:57 <ultimateextras[m> <strcat[m] ""ultimateextras" Don't invite me"> How long ago was it? I didn't see anything, I assumed this question wasn't asked recently enough to find by just scrolling up enough. Search only works for things you've loaded in the GUI. (Yes, I've seen GrapheneOS's Feature page (Also fix your link)).
17:41:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!LOL> There f.e.At least some points

17:43:42 <strcat[m]> "ultimateextras" Don't invite me to your rooms, I'll leave. [CERTIFIED PEDOSLAYER]: so, you've seen the features page, that's a partial overview of how GrapheneOS improves privacy and security
17:43:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!LOL> Ah. Thanks.
17:44:04 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS exists to substantially improve privacy and security through those kinds of enhancements
17:44:08 <strcat[m]> that's the purpose of the project
17:44:37 <strcat[m]> and unlike other aftermarket OSes, it doesn't bundle proprietary apps/services, or reduce privacy and security through poking holes in the security model or adding a bunch of attack surface
17:45:01 <strcat[m]> it is quite unique, other than the attempt to fork it into a closed source commercial product
17:45:18 <ghbcoma[m]> > GrapheneOS exists to substantially improve privacy and security through those kinds of enhancements
17:45:18 <ghbcoma[m]> it's also made me appreciate having a mobile device again.
17:46:25 <ghbcoma[m]> i came from an ios ecosystem and was not happy that i could not control the device the way i wanted.  gos solves many of these problems.  plus imho the pixel hardware i much nicer.
17:48:28 <M011100110110110> do u use yr device rooted or no? are there any cons?
17:49:15 <TheJollyRoger> M011100110110110: GrapheneOS will never support app-accessible root. It destroys the Android security mode, it is mutually exclusive with OTA updates and verified boot, and essentially means if you get compromised, that compromise can now persist across reboots.
17:50:16 <TheJollyRoger> M011100110110110: On Android, only vold, kernel, init, and other low-level system processes required for the device to initialize should ever have root equivalent access, and even then they're constrained via the SELinux mandatory access controls.
17:50:22 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <M011100110110110 "do u use yr device rooted or no?"> GrapheneOS ain't rooted tho
17:50:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Rooting breaks security (and privacy) model of your OS
17:50:39 <M011100110110110> how toenforce fw rules then?
17:50:40 <ultimateextras[m> Is there any sort of place to get information on how GrapheneOS (or any OS, for that matter) handles in certain threat models?
17:50:40 <M011100110110110>  * how to enforce fw rules then?
17:50:41 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No idea, not the correct room to ask that, at least iirc
17:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> M011100110110110: so, yes, there are huge cons: rooting your operating system sets you back in terms of security and privacy roughly fifteen years or more.
17:51:38 <ultimateextras[m> How does GrapheneOS compare to something like Qubes?
17:51:59 <TheJollyRoger> M011100110110110: Not sure what you mean by "fw rules." If you're talking about enforcing system memory management mitigations, GrapheneOS only supports devices that have been very carefully configured for best in class modem isolation.
17:52:44 <skwisgaar[m]> "ultimateextras" Don't invite me to your rooms, I'll leave. [CERTIFIED PEDOSLAYER]: most of your questions have probably been answered already in this chat. You can search the IRC logbot or do a search in element for them.
17:52:47 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: so, with respect to Qubes, GrapheneOS already fully sandboxes each app individually. Qubes has to sandbox each operating system running within it, and makes no efforts to internally sandbox within the respective domains.
17:53:02 <dazinism> "ultimateextras" Don't invite me to your rooms, I'll leave. [CERTIFIED PEDOSLAYER]: GrapheneOS has the extras listed in features on the website
17:53:36 <dazinism> That builds ontop of the AOSP security model, which is already pretty strong
17:54:02 <ultimateextras[m> <skwisgaar[m] ""ultimateextras" Don't invite me"> (The Element Search is ineffective if you haven't manually scrolled up to see more.)
17:54:05 <dazinism> This paper has the details of how Android/AOSP security worls
17:54:08 <dazinism> Works

17:54:17 <M011100110110110> TheJollyRoger: thx, for reply. 'fw rules' = firewall rules
17:54:17 <M011100110110110> I used to forbid apps to made any remote calls
17:54:17 <M011100110110110> not sure how to do this on GOS
17:54:46 <dazinism> "ultimateextras" Don't invite me to your rooms, I'll leave. [CERTIFIED PEDOSLAYER]: you can search at https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
17:54:49 <TheJollyRoger> The two are apples to oranges. Qubes is a hypervisor that's been disguised as a desktop operating system, and unfortunately it's on the x86, for which security was never a big focus and efforts at hardware security have been provisional at best. GrapheneOS is a mobile operating system, and is ported to each specific device with full support for all of the hardware security features of each
17:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> respective handset, including hardware-bound encryption, hardware backed keystore, and remote attestation.
17:54:56 <skwisgaar[m]> Logbot is better anyway
17:54:59 <ultimateextras[m> Thank you. dazinism

17:56:20 <TheJollyRoger> M011100110110110: GrapheneOS has the network permission, which will prevent an application from dialing out. Remember that if you simply block certain domains, as long as an app can dial out to DNS, it can simply exfiltrate data via sending malformed DNS queries so simply blacklisting specific domains (or even whitelisting known good ones) doesn't adequately address the threat model you've
17:56:21 <TheJollyRoger> likely got in mind.
17:59:09 <TheJollyRoger> Also remember that blocking advertising domains makes you really really stand out, as by enumerating which domains you have blocked, websites can quite easily tell your browser apart from the others that don't.
18:01:37 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: I think this is one of the biggest mistakes people make when trying to improve their privacy. The whole ‚Äútracker blocking‚Äù obsession has got to go
18:01:57 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: yes, totally agree!
18:02:07 <anupritaisno1> okay i need help
18:02:12 <anupritaisno1> wrong channel
18:02:37 <TheJollyRoger> This is why Tor Browser deliberately makes no effort to implement adblocking, and neither does GrapheneOS; we don't want sites enumerating which domains you have blocked via a little bit of clever pixel embedding, remembering which visitor blocks which, and then using that to distinguish individual visitors at a later date.
18:02:43 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1: er, what's up...?
18:03:23 <TheJollyRoger> That's an attack that someone could do without needing JavaScript, only just a little bit of basic html.

18:32:38 <pukilo> okay and how to build it for samsung galaxy s7
18:32:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <pukilo "how to be sure Graphine OS dont "> This is not mentioning the Updater app unable to get serial number of its users and rejects any serialno-related updates

18:43:51 <pukilo> what is required to build image for non supported devices ?
18:44:23 <panoramics[m]> Hello folks! Just wanna share some love for graphene, really loving the overall experience so far! This might sound really stupid but I have a question concerning microphone access. I've gotten quite paranoid recently about having intimate conversations next to my phone. On a scale of 1 to 10, how concerned would you be using a brand new pixel 5 with fresh graphene install in that regards? Is it a non issue due to
18:44:24 <panoramics[m]> system architecture? Thanks!
18:45:04 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <pukilo "what is required to build image "> It's also in the site (https://grapheneos.org/build) but on hardware, around 200GB storage and 32GB RAM?
18:45:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <panoramics[m] "Hello folks! Just wanna share so"> It's a nonissue using a new Pixel device assuming you can unlock its bootloader
18:46:03 <pukilo> luckily i have 32 gig ram!
18:47:27 <panoramics[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "It's a nonissue using a new Pixe"> I remember being asked to lock it after install? You mean it should stay unlocked?
18:48:44 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <panoramics[m] "I remember being asked to lock i"> Nah, you need to be able to unlock bootloader to relock it

19:00:12 <madaidan[m]> <pukilo "let users decide what is correct"> User choice doesn't dictate reality.
19:00:13 <pukilo> why how was ur experience PNK
19:00:32 <PNK[m]> I usually stay out of internet drama i just found this through someone else liking this tweet
19:00:34 <strcat[m]> he spent weeks/months putting together a bunch of dishonest claims and spin
19:00:43 <strcat[m]> misrepresenting a bunch of things out of context and lying about what they show
19:00:53 <pukilo> 3 pros and cons about this os?
19:00:55 <strcat[m]> it will take time to have people go through it and put together a response
19:00:58 <strcat[m]> not going to happen today
19:01:02 <strcat[m]> pukilo: https://grapheneos.org/features
19:01:07 <anhingas> Hey everyone, I'm new, installing graphene right now on a Pixel 3a via the web installer.¬† is it normal for the "writing vendor" step to take more than 30 minutes?
19:01:13 <parlen-colen> Hi everyone. I have a Pixel3A that is stuck on headphone mode. I tried installing an APK to force it to go over speakers, and it works for some seconds, to then go back over headphones. Do you know what can I do to solve the problem, or to force the OS to go over speakers? I barely use headphones, so no issue for me if it goes always over speakers
19:01:17 <strcat[m]> anhingas: no, means USB connection dropping
19:01:17 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <anhingas "Hey everyone, I'm new, installin"> Nah
19:01:26 <PNK[m]> <pukilo "why how was ur experience PNK"> literally fine. lol
19:01:34 <strcat[m]> anhingas: read info it has at the top about USB cables, etc. and make sure to use a reliable cable
19:01:39 <strcat[m]> anhingas: many USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
19:01:44 <strcat[m]> non-spec-compliant
19:01:48 <strcat[m]> and they drop connection
19:01:57 <strcat[m]> make sure to use a high quality cable that's fully pushed in on both ends
19:02:00 <anhingas> roger that and thanks for the feedback
19:02:06 <strcat[m]> and consider that USB ports may be broken / faulty
19:02:14 <anhingas> I'll try a different cable
19:02:24 <strcat[m]> it advises using the rear ports on a desktop and avoiding the front ports for that reason
19:02:26 <pukilo> its one hour long video... he should explain in short how this os is this bad
19:02:29 <strcat[m]> the ports provided by a case are often broken
19:02:39 <PNK[m]> yeah this is schitzo ranting for an hour lol
19:02:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Liam (@l‚Äãdfmitchell) has joined the Telegram Group!
19:02:45 <strcat[m]> pukilo: really not a good topic for the channel
19:02:51 <strcat[m]> this person has been maliciously attacking us for a long time
19:02:53 <strcat[m]> it's nothing new
19:03:05 <strcat[m]> I would really appreciate if people didn't propagate his nonsense further
19:03:21 <strcat[m]> it is going to take away substantial time from working on building privacy and security technologies as it is
19:03:30 <pukilo> this is my first time seeing people attack on different projects even today
19:03:47 <PNK[m]> sorry i brought it up :)
19:03:54 <madaidan[m]> <pukilo "its one hour long video... he sh"> His problem never was with the software itself. He has a personal grudge against the developers and community.
19:03:54 <strcat[m]> I was intending to spend time today working on reducing hardened_malloc memory usage, going through the old SELinux policy work and figuring out how to restore more of it, and going through the old Bionic hardening work and figuring out how to port that forward
19:04:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <pukilo "this is my first time seeing peo"> That's self-interest for 'ya
19:04:15 <strcat[m]> and I was going to try to see where people were at with enabling certain miscellaneous AOSP features and try to get some review of that done
19:04:18 <strcat[m]> the theme stuff
19:05:04 <pukilo> anywhy he has 126K subs... its gonna harm the project i guess,
19:05:21 <strcat[m]> was also going to take a look at anupritaisno1's work on the kernel LTS branch stuff (i.e. going back to us quickly applying all the upstream LTS patches instead of getting the security ones via the monthly security updates and then regular rollups of the rest via quarterly AOSP releases)
19:05:23 <strcat[m]> pukilo: aware
19:05:43 <strcat[m]> pukilo: definitely going to cause harm to the project, and to me, and on a bigger scale than what he has done in the past
19:06:10 <strcat[m]> pukilo: what he did in the past already caused a lot of bullying and harassment directed towards the project developers and a lot of what he's trying to do is to claim that us defending ourselves from these attacks is us causing drama
19:06:28 <strcat[m]> there are people who build things, and sadly, also people who spend most of their time trying to tear stuff down and cause harm to others
19:06:44 <pukilo> woah!
19:06:46 <strcat[m]> overall, people are supportive of our work
19:07:04 <strcat[m]> however, unfortunately, there are certain small groups of people who have tried to cause harm to the project on a consistent basis
19:07:10 <strcat[m]> they've waged a war on us for multiple years
19:07:29 <strcat[m]> it's going to take time to go through the latest deluge of BS and write a response to it
19:07:49 <strcat[m]> the fact that it's in video format makes it more difficult to quote and respond to it
19:08:04 <strcat[m]> and I do not think that's really going to do much to reduce the harm it will cause so it's not a particularly high priority
19:08:52 <strcat[m]> us trying to defend ourselves from these relentless attacks on the project is being misrepresented as us being the ones causing drama, it's such nonsense
19:10:25 <strcat[m]> again, I would really appreciate it if people did not disrupt the channel and take away from developer time from the project by propagating these nonsense attacks from malicious people
19:11:01 <strcat[m]> received 30 messages like https://twitter.com/lyckaform/status/1378039290979094529 today already and expect a lot more of that and more raids on the channels as they've organized in the past
19:11:08 <strcat[m]> that is the intent
19:11:30 <strcat[m]> it is what happened based on far less drastic attacks that person made in the past, and so I expect harassment on a much bigger scale now
19:11:34 <strcat[m]> that's what they intend to do
19:11:52 <strcat[m]> they personally target and harass people and claim that those people are the ones at fault for trying to defend themselves
19:13:02 <strcat[m]> and yes, I struggle with depression, and I am not good at dealing with these people waging a war against the project and against me, but it is not me causing any drama, I am defending myself from them
19:13:07 <strcat[m]> I'm not seeking fights with them
19:13:18 <strcat[m]> they do this stuff and I have to figure out how to defend us and respond to it
19:13:32 <strcat[m]> that is not causing drama, it is responding to attacks inflicted on us
19:14:01 <strcat[m]> so, you can screencap this and claim out of context that I'm trying to stir up drama but it's simply not true
19:14:07 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "received 30 messages like https:"> What even goes through these peoples' heads? They say someone needs mental help... so they attack and insult them? Like what????
19:14:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <madaidan[m] "What even goes through these peo"> Yeah, messed up.
19:14:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not surprised from the perpetrator itself
19:14:58 <strcat[m]> and yeah, based on all the bullying and harassment directed towards me on a daily basis, I do probably need help with my depression
19:15:05 <somenerd[m]> > What even goes through these peoples' heads? They say someone needs mental help... so they attack and insult them? Like what????
19:15:05 <somenerd[m]> that's some really odd tweet
19:15:12 <strcat[m]> based on what Copperhead and techlore (primarily) have done over the past couple years
19:15:21 <somenerd[m]> who goes and tweets "I hate you, switching from your OS"
19:15:30 <somenerd[m]> what's the use?
19:15:52 <strcat[m]> it has made my depression much worse, and it's largely based on these attacks on me, not on anything else in my life
19:16:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <somenerd[m] "who goes and tweets "I hate you,"> Given that they ban users for criticizing their videos and mods claiming it is rightful to do so.
19:16:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Don't expect anything good out of them, even worse than atheists smh
19:16:39 <strcat[m]> the war that Copperhead started against me 3 years ago has destroyed my life
19:16:56 <strcat[m]> it is not my choice that anything of this happened
19:17:14 <strcat[m]> I have done my best to continue the project through all of this and to defend myself and other project members from their attacks
19:17:24 <strcat[m]> I spend $3000/month on legal fees dealing with it
19:17:51 <strcat[m]> it is not something that I sought out
19:18:15 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "it has made my depression much w"> I am really sorry to hear that this is all happening to you. It makes me sad. You are an amazing human being, and thank you for everything you do. I sincerely, and humbly appreciate you, this community and all the knowledge I learn from you and others here.
19:18:15 <strcat[m]> I have no energy left to deal with anything else after dealing with all of these endless attacks
19:18:19 <strcat[m]> all the misinformation people spread
19:19:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Given that they ban users for cr"> (Just some of them, please don't reach them out and get emotional at them)
19:22:15 <strcat[m]> believe me I don't want to deal with the war on the project by Copperhead, the nonsense caused by a certain subset of the cryptocurrency community tied to that, malicious people like techlore aiming to stir up drama and bully/harass me out of spite and for views, etc.
19:22:25 <strcat[m]> have to deal with far more than that
19:24:06 * strcat[m] uploaded an image: (190KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GraXUzHkMTMNFCNMGsrAvBUZ/ddos.png >
19:24:19 <strcat[m]> I need to take a look at what's happening with this first
19:24:39 <strcat[m]> unusual amount of BS to deal with today
19:25:05 <strcat[m]> and to clarify those are DDoS attacks past the level that trigger OVH to mitigate them by redirecting network traffic away from our servers
19:25:25 <strcat[m]> that's not something that has happened for months
19:28:14 <grapheneos_user_> Hmmm...
19:28:22 <grapheneos_user_> I wonder who did that...
19:28:43 <skwisgaar[m]> I can‚Äôt imagine the strength required to deal with everything going on right now. There is so much evil in the world. But to stand up to that evil and keep moving is part of why we are here.
19:29:26 <strcat[m]> and btw I have to have these go to my old gmail address because my @grapheneos.org email is hosted via the infra
19:29:35 <strcat[m]> so can't have the infra send email to itself about itself
19:29:43 <strcat[m]> not a good idea
19:29:44 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Mostly just people whose attitude "I got mine" messes this up.
19:30:55 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "so can't have the infra send ema"> Lol
19:34:41 <gensu[m]> strcat If all this drama is effecting you in a bad way why not take a step back let others you trust do more moderation? Take some self and health time and do what makes you happy?
19:35:51 <strcat[m]> it will still impact me even if I ignore it
19:36:32 <gensu[m]> You can't defend yourself against every attack people throw your way.
19:37:28 <gensu[m]> Sure it will but will that impact be more or less on yourself if you get involved?
19:42:25 <gensu[m]> I know you likely perceive TL as antagonistic toward you and your project at this point. Why not make peace take responsibly for anything you or GOS didn't do as well as you could and try and have a good relationship moving forward?
19:42:43 <strcat[m]> gensu: we didn't do something wrong to him
19:42:51 <strcat[m]> he has been bullying/harassing me for a long period of time
19:43:00 <strcat[m]> and he's spinning us defending ourselves from them as us causing drama
19:43:10 <strcat[m]> he's misrepresenting a bunch of stuff, not presenting it honestly
19:43:30 <strcat[m]> gensu: if you support someone that engages in harassment/bullying of our developers, including myself, you aren't welcome here
19:43:31 <gensu[m]> I found GOS because of TL and thought that the whole performance comparison was silly bc I don't care about milliseconds. I care about security ect.
19:43:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <gensu[m] "I found GOS because of TL and th"> Until he fixes his behavior, it's highly unlikely
19:44:10 <strcat[m]> gensu: that video misrepresented what happened, made personal attacks on me, accused me of this nonsense conspiracy and is part of his overall bullying campaign
19:44:15 <gensu[m]> I'm not saying you did anything wrong. I am saying if u did.
19:44:18 <strcat[m]>  * gensu: that video misrepresented the facts, made personal attacks on me, accused me of this nonsense conspiracy and is part of his overall bullying campaign
19:44:34 <strcat[m]> he's the one waging a war against us
19:44:48 <strcat[m]> we haven't done anything to him beyond defending ourselves including explaining to people what he has been doing when it comes up
19:44:51 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <gensu[m] "I'm not saying you did anything "> And that warranted the misinformation campaign?
19:44:51 <strcat[m]> such as right now
19:45:26 <strcat[m]> he has a grudge against me because to me he was some random person messaging me and I didn't treat him as royalty based on him having a substantial social media following
19:45:35 <strcat[m]> so I didn't give him moderation powers, I didn't help him make content for his channel, etc.
19:45:51 <strcat[m]> I didn't have a reason to trust him or invest substantial time in working with him, he'd never contributed anything
19:45:58 <strcat[m]> I didn't even know he had a YouTube channel
19:46:14 <strcat[m]> I regularly spend substantial time helping people and mentoring them
19:46:25 <strcat[m]> he just wanted me to make content for him and promote his content
19:46:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> If there was a true intent to help, I doubt it will reach at this point
19:46:36 <strcat[m]> all he has wanted from the start is views / subscriptions and attention
19:46:43 <strcat[m]> that's what all this about, and I think that's easy to see
19:46:59 <strcat[m]> I'm not going to give him any of the attention he craves
19:47:30 <strcat[m]> at no point is the @GrapheneOS account or website going to mention some dishonest YouTube influencer trying to get views
19:47:35 <pukilo> how to build asop
19:47:53 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build is our guide on building GrapheneOS and other aspects of development
19:48:06 <strcat[m]> plan on improving the emulator documentation soon to cover making standalone images for use in the emulator
19:48:20 <gensu[m]> From an outsiders perspective its a shame that you guys couldn't work together.
19:48:23 <strcat[m]> rather than only the existing documentation on using `emulator` from the GrapheneOS source tree (from AOSP)
19:48:37 <madaidan[m]> gensu: It's impossible to reason with Techlore. The guy is incredibly closed minded and always goes in circles. My friends and I have tried to reason with him multiple times before.
19:48:47 <strcat[m]> gensu: I'm unsure why we'd want to work with a narcissistic YouTube influencer who spreads misinformation
19:48:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <gensu[m] "From an outsiders perspective it"> There was no way to make it work anyways, as madaidan said
19:48:59 <strcat[m]> gensu: we aren't going to collaborate with someone like that, sorry
19:49:01 <somenerd[m]> > gensu: It's impossible to reason with Techlore. The guy is incredibly closed minded and always goes in circles. My friends and I have tried to reason with him multiple times before.
19:49:01 <somenerd[m]> yeah, he likes to ban people who critisize him
19:49:04 <strcat[m]> he'll have to eventually get over that
19:49:10 <somenerd[m]> not open minded really
19:49:27 <strcat[m]> his whole grudge is based one the fact that I didn't invest time and resources into working with him
19:49:30 <strcat[m]> I did not ignore him
19:49:33 <strcat[m]> I responded to him
19:49:51 <strcat[m]> I simply wasn't interested in making an install video with him or otherwise participating in making content for his channel
19:50:03 <strcat[m]> and I'm glad we didn't
19:50:07 * madaidan[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qmRKOFBeHwVroRKPqTLWoWnH/message.txt >
19:50:09 <strcat[m]> I'm glad we aren't associated with him
19:50:19 <madaidan[m]> And yet, he claims we're the toxic community.
19:50:26 <strcat[m]> I would like to work with people who make that kind of content
19:50:31 <somenerd[m]> > He even banned one of his own mods for criticising the lack of action being taken against known bigots and trolls.
19:50:31 <somenerd[m]> wow
19:50:41 <somenerd[m]> banned one of his own mods?
19:50:52 <strcat[m]> people with integrity and honesty who are interested in making quality, accurate content
19:51:08 <urrrrmm[m]> GropheneOS is the most toxic community, you guys have some next level superiority complex, where you don‚Äôt even listen to constructive criticism
19:51:13 <strcat[m]> I'll happily spend substantial time working with someone who makes videos, podcasts, etc.
19:51:20 <madaidan[m]> <somenerd[m] "banned one of his own mods? "> Nearly all of the original mod team has been banned or has resigned.
19:51:32 <skwisgaar[m]> That was mature lmao
19:51:49 <strcat[m]> they regular use sockpuppet accounts and encourage raids on our channel
19:51:51 <strcat[m]> please just ignore it
19:51:57 <strcat[m]> don't interact with people participating in raiding the channel
19:52:05 <strcat[m]> if moderators aren't around, ping us, and we can come here and ban them
19:52:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <urrrrmm[m] "GropheneOS is the most toxic com"> Ah yes, the toxic community didn't accommodate the consideration to have own builds on microG and the all-good influencer savoring on taking credit on it
19:52:29 <gensu[m]> OK I don't need to get into all the details. I think it might be wise to not have to get into the muck all the time because it will wear you down.
19:53:20 <lolrepeatlol[m]> <strcat[m] "they regular use sockpuppet acco"> what about the screenshot on his video though, where a higher up on grapheneos encouraged to make fake twt/reddit accounts for example? (i'm genuinely curious to hear your side of the story)
19:53:23 <madaidan[m]> <gensu[m] "OK I don't need to get into all "> It's not exactly easy to just ignore a constant stream of vicious attacks on your character.
19:54:35 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <lolrepeatlol[m] "what about the screenshot on his"> Oh that, I guess using virtual phone numbers is fake account now?
19:54:38 <skwisgaar[m]> gensu: much of the information in his new video is highly misleading and ignores things which have been clearly explained in this channel hundreds of times. Techlore has a grudge and is using misleading tactics to paint himself as a victim.
19:54:38 <somenerd[m]> > It's not exactly easy to just ignore a constant stream of vicious attacks on your character.
19:54:38 <somenerd[m]> or people spamming in the channel
19:54:55 <somenerd[m]> derailing conversation
19:55:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Oh that, I guess using virtual p"> I mean, it's my first impression
19:55:12 <strcat[m]> lolrepeatlol: no one involved in GrapheneOS encouraged anyone to make fake Twitter accounts, that is a lie
19:55:13 <madaidan[m]> <lolrepeatlol[m] "what about the screenshot on his"> He never encouraged making sockpuppets. The messages were taken out of context and misrepresented. Using a virtual phone number does not imply creating sockpuppets, particularly in a privacy-focused community. If the entire context was given, you'd see that using sockpuppet accounts was explicitly banned.
19:55:27 <strcat[m]> lolrepeatlol: people in this channel were encouraged to help us respond to Copperhead spreading misinformation on Twitter
19:55:32 <strcat[m]> suggest looking at the thread on Twitter
19:55:50 <strcat[m]> it was requested of people in this channel because we wanted our actual users, real people, to help us respond with their own words / views
19:55:52 <lolrepeatlol[m]> i see, thanks, do you have a link? :)
19:55:57 <strcat[m]> that is the opposite of using sockpuppets
19:55:58 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "I mean, it's my first impression"> I don't think it's wise to use your real phone numbers in face of defending against misinformation
19:56:00 <lolrepeatlol[m]>  * i see, thanks, do you have a link to the thread? :)
19:56:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Using a virtual phone number != Make sockpuppets
19:56:39 <madaidan[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "gensu: much of the information i"> It's ironic, considering he always used the "you're just victim playing" card against me.
19:56:39 <strcat[m]> lolrepeatlol: https://twitter.com/jack/status/1355295732836626432 there is the thread, you can see @_copperj (CopperheadOS CEO) spreading misinformation and trying to use this to harm us

19:57:30 <strcat[m]> our community are not the kind of people who use social media sites like Twitter

19:58:16 <strcat[m]> and they're succeeding
19:58:22 <strcat[m]> people falling for their misinformation/lies is unfortunate
19:58:35 <strcat[m]> their claims are very plainly false and refuted by looking at the details

20:02:09 <pukilo> are all with [m] in the name dev?

20:02:20 <somenerd[m]> those are matrix users
20:02:25 <strcat[m]> no [m] is what Matrix sticks at the end of your IRC username by default
20:02:25 <pukilo> ok
20:02:33 <strcat[m]> but you can change the username it uses on IRC
20:02:38 <strcat[m]> so [m] isn't always going to be there
20:02:45 <strcat[m]> it's just what it uses as your default name on the IRC side
20:02:52 <strcat> I'm here on IRC too
20:03:01 <strcat> I just tend to be using Matrix because I have it open in a browser tab
20:03:08 <pukilo> irc and matrix are connected ?
20:03:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> strcat: Thought it was good enough to have it open as the desktop app.
20:03:22 <strcat> so it's closer than pressing super key + down arrow to switch to the weechat window
20:03:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Telegram too
20:03:28 <strcat> yes Matrix / IRC channel is the same channel
20:03:30 <strcat> it's bridged

20:03:42 <strcat> this is the Telegram bridge
20:03:43 <pukilo> i never tried matrix myself btw
20:03:48 <strcat> the bridge bot for Telegram is a single user
20:04:00 <pukilo> got it
20:04:01 <strcat> Matris creates an IRC user for each person on Matrix
20:04:06 <strcat> and a virtual Matrix user for each person on IRC
20:04:10 <strcat> to make a more seamless bridge
20:04:33 <pukilo> u can make discord bridge bot too
20:04:36 <strcat> we have an IRC channel, and a Matrix room, and the bridge makes them act as 1 room
20:04:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pukilo "u can make discord bridge bot to"> No

20:05:12 <KanYe[m]> Vandium?

21:11:15 <strcat[m]> we'll continue choosing supported devices based on what makes sense
21:11:47 <strcat[m]> the project is in no way strongly tied to Pixels, they have simply been the best devices for us, and other devices have not met basic standards
21:11:56 <strcat[m]> the long term project goals do not involve using Pixels
21:12:16 <zvl12[m]> what other devices might suit ?
21:12:37 <strcat[m]> future devices we'd consider supporting aren't released yet so we can't really answer that

21:23:02 <hades123[m]> I read daniel is parraniod
21:23:44 <madaidan[m]> <hades123[m] "I read daniel is parraniod"> Then you read bullshit
21:24:03 <psychologicaldam> <hades123[m] "I read daniel is parraniod"> And why write about it here? Just form your own opinion
21:24:19 <hades123[m]> Wy not
21:24:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Clearly not paranoid enough
21:24:47 <madaidan[m]> <hades123[m] "Wy not "> Your insults aren't particularly on-topic
21:24:56 <hades123[m]> It is the tru he must be relax that wy i say it
21:25:34 <hades123[m]> He can better focus on graphene os and not to that bullshit
21:25:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Wai u speak like diz, yu gave a mental disability yes
21:26:46 <Guest43520> I just rebooted phone and privacy > permission manager now shows the detail (not loading anymore). But weird thing is many system apps are listed now had just been exp
21:28:13 <strcat[m]> hades123: suggest trolling elsewhere
21:29:53 <Guest43520> Oooops wrong button. Like sensors list 153 of 173 apps allowed even though i have hide system set. I had just been exoerimenting with blocking system apps in netguard. I dont recall my sensors ever being that high
21:31:44 <strcat[m]> illiterate, lowlife trolls harassing people probably don't have any disabilities resulting in what they do but rather they are that way because they simply choose to be awful people with no skills
21:31:56 <strcat[m]> not something a disability makes you do
21:32:01 <strcat[m]> so, please, no need for that
21:33:06 <strcat[m]> that's why I removed that Telegram message
21:33:08 <strcat[m]> unnecessary
21:35:58 <nextrobn[m]> Hi guys, I need some help!
21:36:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> No worries, I totally understand why you'd delete my belitteling message to them. I just think you can expect something like that when you go around trying to waste people's time, so might aswell have some fun with it
21:38:17 <psychologicaldam> No, you are stirring drama and wasting even more time that way. You should find other ways to have fun üôÇ
21:38:47 <strcat[m]> nextrobn: just ask about what you need help with and you'll probably get help
21:38:57 <nahman[m]> <psychologicaldam "No, you are stirring drama and w"> Just now I did yes. But this is the last time baby I swear I love your I'll never hit you again.
21:40:20 <nextrobn[m]> Every time I try to cmd and install Graphene on my 4a, the cmd window just disappears.
21:40:48 <dnull> Why are you not using the web installer?
21:41:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> nextrobn[m]: You could use the Web Installer to make things much easier.
21:41:29 <nextrobn[m]> I get an error. Something about some files are missing
21:42:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> nextrobn[m]: You probably also downloaded the wrong thing. Avoid guides outside of https://grapheneos.org
21:43:49 <eric> hello, i read the phone checks for updates every 4 hours in the background but i have not received the 2021-03-30 update yet does anyone know how long it takes to get it?
21:43:56 <nextrobn[m]> The web installer was able to findy phone,  so I just download the image from there.
21:44:57 <strcat[m]> nextrobn: use web installer for the whole thing
21:47:10 <southron[m]> Make sure you use recommended browser for web install also
21:47:14 <nextrobn[m]> I'm doing that. :)
21:47:14 <nextrobn[m]> When I press on 'flash release' I get an error, when its unpacking the image.
21:47:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Using Firefox is a bad idea because of the lousy WebUSB implementation.
21:47:57 <nextrobn[m]> <southron[m] "Make sure you use recommended br"> I use Edge  in "privatemode" üòÅ
21:48:08 <southron[m]> Take off private mode
21:48:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> The guide asks you not to use Incognito.
21:48:21 <southron[m]> For the install
21:49:18 <nextrobn[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<gochoingles> The guide asks you"> I've also tried that, but I will try again :)
21:50:11 <southron[m]> I would disable any addons you have also if it isn't working
21:50:57 <nextrobn[m]> In normal mode I get an error ' unable to claim interface, but in incognito it was fine
21:51:35 <nextrobn[m]> <southron[m] "I would disable any addons you h"> I don't have any addons
21:54:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> TheJollyRoger: we could use some help over here.
21:55:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> nextrobn[m]: You should wait for a dev to reply.
21:55:47 <nextrobn[m]> <nextrobn[m] "In normal mode I get an error ' "> I found the problem. I forgot to close the incognito tab. I don't have that error anymore
21:56:13 <nextrobn[m]> I think its working now!!
22:07:21 <brixx[m]> Hey Guys, I just installed Graphene OS on a Pixel 4a to get rid of Big Brother. So far I have only installed Apps from FDroid and Aurora for my basic needs.
22:07:21 <brixx[m]> Now my bold question ... is there a way to watch Netflix on Graphene OS without spoiling the whole endeavour?
22:08:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> What constitutes spoiling the endeavour?
22:09:25 <brixx[m]> Staying as private as possible and  not leaking data/personal information to Google
22:10:10 <kepoff[m]> Will answer this in  #grapheneos-offtopic
22:10:29 <brixx[m]> Kk, THX omw
