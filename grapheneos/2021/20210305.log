00:01:16 <idkrn[m]1> <strcat[m] "and then you can use something e"> something wrong with signal?
00:02:14 <jay46> Since i started playing with a phone again.. I have only used shelter with a work profile. I made a 2nd user lastnight and it auto loaded up connected to a wifi i used once. I just ran ipleak in that user just to double check and with the vpn only installed on admin it did not work for user ..  I just thought it was at least a possibility that
00:02:14 <jay46> graphene would make it so a vpn setup in admin could be universal across all users.
00:04:59 <strcat[m]> jay46: it is possible to do that
00:05:03 <strcat[m]> but by default they are per-user
00:05:21 <strcat[m]> it's possibly to use a device policy manager to force all users to use a certain vpn basically
00:05:25 <jay46> Okay.. I am reading the links you sent right now.
00:05:32 <strcat[m]> for personal use
00:05:39 <strcat[m]> I would recommend just setting up some VPN app in each
00:05:46 <strcat[m]> make it always on + block connections not through it
00:05:56 <strcat[m]> and then when you're on that user, you have the UI to switch the server endpoint etc
00:06:01 <jay46> setting up the vpn app in each isnt really that big a deal also.
00:06:04 <strcat[m]> similar to Wi-Fi etc
00:06:29 <strcat[m]> we fixed always-on to work properly across profiles / when switching profiles and then got upstream to fix it
00:06:33 <strcat[m]> so it works right in AOSP now
00:06:37 <strcat[m]> jay46: basically it's just flexible
00:06:41 <strcat[m]> it's not really a problem
00:07:01 <pinkylittlecat[m> i'm here because i'm pissed with my bank, they rely on google play services to run their app. i've read in a few places that there's a development going regarding using a microG-like approach to do a signature spoofing specifically to only google play services (if i understood it right, because enabling signature spoofing globally is absolutely terrible in a security-wise view)
00:07:01 <pinkylittlecat[m> is this right?
00:07:23 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services explains our plans
00:07:43 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: we want to make a GrapheneOS 'Play services' app which appears to be signed with Google's key instead of our GrapheneOS Play services signing key
00:07:49 <strcat[m]> but it would not actually implement Google services
00:07:56 <strcat[m]> and we don't have plans to do anything with microG anymore
00:08:10 <strcat[m]> it would just exist to make apps work that are capable of running without Google services being available but require Play services
00:08:21 <strcat[m]> our 'Play services' would just report that nothing is available / nothing works
00:08:26 <strcat[m]> all servers down
00:08:34 <strcat[m]> Google was wiped off the face of the planet, sorry app
00:08:51 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so a lot of apps would start working with that, but without functionality that depends on Play
00:08:57 <strcat[m]> if they require Play just for login etc. then it won't work
00:09:17 <strcat[m]> pretty good chance your banking app won't work even with actual Play services if it uses SafetyNet to enforce using stock OS
00:09:49 <jay46> I just thought, when I first startup a fresh user, its at least to some extent a fresh entity, but if it instantly has net access without going thru a vpn, theres a bit of a link between the system and the net without the vpn, which allows for some lessening of a fresh entity. ..  if I wrote that to make sense. Though the idea is that your OS isnt
00:09:49 <jay46> instantly trying to do anything anyways right when I create a new user.
00:09:54 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: I'd recommend just using their site and use desktop mode in the browser to bypass them trying to force you to use their app if they do that
00:10:09 <strcat[m]> that's also how I recommend using YouTube
00:10:11 <strcat[m]> etc.
00:10:17 <strcat[m]> use desktop mode browser for YouTube
00:10:19 <strcat[m]> plays HD video just fine
00:10:37 <strcat[m]> mobile browser gets crippled 360p or w/e
00:10:40 <strcat[m]> to force you to use the app
00:10:56 <strcat[m]> and they purposely don't support the API that allows background media playback in the browser
00:11:04 <strcat[m]> and don't support it in their app either
00:11:09 <strcat[m]> unless you pay for premium service
00:11:15 <strcat[m]> just standard stuff companies do shrug
00:11:18 <strcat[m]> Reddit is similar
00:12:00 <strcat[m]> jay46: you can flip on airplane mode b4 creating a user if you care
00:12:14 <strcat[m]> jay46: this is an area likely to improve in AOSP each major release
00:12:31 <strcat[m]> jay46: user profiles are getting better too, upstream, and we plan to add some extra frills for them
00:14:56 <justinhsa[m]> Hello, is it recommended to run Auditor in owner profile? Currently I am using a secondary profile as my main, and running remote attestation service from there. But I'm wondering if I should run it in my owner profile instead.
00:15:17 <jay46> How about a way to backup the entire phone. I know I brought this up yesterday but it just, to me, seems like a good thing to be able to setup the entire phone, multiple users/profiles/purposes, all the apps, accounts whatever it is I want setup, then backup the entire Phone/Data/Users/Setup and after using the phone for awhile, I can always wipe
00:15:17 <jay46> it and go back to that original fresh install. Just feels like giving the phone a wash, in case random stuff is there, or just if it gets taken unlocked somehow, less data leakage in phone.
00:19:49 <pinkylittlecat[m>  * i'm here because i'm pissed with my bank agency, they rely on google play services to run their app. i've read (ie. grapheneOS's official website) that there's a development going on regarding using a microG-like approach to do a signature spoofing specifically to only google play services (if i understood it right, because enabling signature spoofing globally is absolutely terrible in a security-wise view)

00:28:31 <jay46> Another thing that would be useful, as opposed to anyone who got a hold of a phone unlocked, they can go to switch and see one list, and yes they might not get passwords, or say you are forced to unlock for them, or just can because thats not where your most sensitive stuff is.  .. Because some other sequence leads to a list of hidden users you
00:28:31 <jay46> can switch to but you cant get to that spot to switch to those users unless you knew where they were hidden.

00:30:01 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't want to make any privacy or security feature which doesn't actually work
00:30:09 <strcat[m]> and only gives users a false sense of privacy/security
00:31:13 <dazinism> With main user unlocked you can enable adb and get full lists of everything through that. Even if you could hide stuff in the UI
00:31:16 <jay46> People in some countries might be forced to unlock phones under threat of violence. So if you can unlock phone, unlock users, but there is a hidden user somewhere with the most sensitive profile in it, they could appear to cooperate while maintaining their most sensitive user profile locked hidden away... something like that
00:32:01 <strcat[m]> we won't implement a feature that doesn't work if the attacker knows the feature exists

07:27:53 <jay46> Hi, Trying to install graphene right now on a pixel 5. Using the web install. A the part where I boot into the bootloader interface. I restart phone, hold volume down key and it turns on into the fastboot mode, but when I hit the "Unlock Bootloader" button the web install it gives me this Error: The device must be opened first.
07:34:50 <lodtank> did you unlock the device in the current running android?
07:35:01 <lodtank> afair by clicking on the build number?
07:35:54 <jay46> ya, opened developer mode and enabled oem unlocking
07:37:31 <jay46> the udev rules comment about having to have it enabled is something I am unfamiliar with and trying to read about... the step before the unlock the bootloader says "On Linux, you'll need to do this again if you didn't have the udev rules set up when you connected it."
07:45:58 <jay46> no one else around for advice... i have tried repeating the steps repeatly and get the same "Error: The device must be opened first."
08:03:32 <jay46> can anyone help with this issue... trying to install graphene right now on a pixel 5. i turned on developer options and the oem and ive restarted into fastboot but when I hit the web install button to unlock the bootloader I get this error ...  Error: The device must be opened first.

08:20:07 <pizzaeater69[m]> <jay46 "can anyone help with this issue."> "use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports on a laptop. Many widely distributed USB cables and
08:20:07 <pizzaeater69[m]> hubs are broken and are the most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS."
08:24:15 <jay46> I am using an old computer .. no usb c ports, but using a usb a to usb c cord it does recognize the pixel 5 but gives me that error about the device must be opened..

08:29:04 <dontdisturbme[m]> After creating a secondary user profile, I'm unable to install FDroid or other apps that are present in main profile. Is this a standard limitation for multiprofile?
08:29:44 <jay46> ya, thats when that error message pops up. So if I refresh the web install page, get that little window to popup to connect the pixel 5, click on the phone, hit connect, right in that part of the install, that error message pops up in red lettering
08:30:05 <pizzaeater69[m]> <dontdisturbme[m] "After creating a secondary user "> You can install like Foxydroid from dfroid to your main profile and than delete fdroid. and then fdroid to the secondary profile

09:07:40 <pizzaeater69[m]> Our recommendation for a high security setup is to use the owner profile only for managing other profiles. Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device.

11:38:06 <mtcw[m]> jay46: .
11:41:27 <dazinism> dontdisturbme: you have to somehow install the app in each user, but once they are installed doing an update in any user updates it for all users
11:42:10 <dazinism> Have to be careful when installing an app to use the same version or newer if its installed elsewhere
11:43:41 <dazinism> Also has to have the same signature (eg. Not the same app from FDroid and Play - which would have different sigs)
12:23:33 <dontdisturbme[m]> <dazinism "Have to be careful when installi"> Not sure how that is possible since the apps are supposed to be isolated from each profile yet it doesn't allow the same app to be installed in each profile. I earlier tested uninstall FDroid from main profile and was able to successfully install to a secondary profile. Installing a second copy with older version doesn't work either.
13:01:24 <dazinism> dontdisturbme: think you are a bit confused. It is a bit confusing
13:01:30 <dazinism> Maybe this will help
13:01:33 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
13:02:12 <dazinism> There are ways to share/sync a password manager file across user profiles
13:02:45 <dazinism> Using network
13:03:38 <dazinism> Think Nextcloud may work well for that.
13:04:47 <dazinism> The way I operate user profiles I don't want/need access to the same passwords in different user profiles
13:05:31 <dazinism> Different profiles can have their own password manager with the passwords used in that profile

13:37:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Yes
13:38:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Anyway if somebody actually wants to help getting this done we won't turn them away from it
13:38:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Just that we focus more on privacy and security improvements
13:38:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> It'd also need to be tested on every device and we'd need to know that we aren't breaking anything
13:39:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Of course I understand and I bet we all appreciate that here!
13:41:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Yeah so the best would be for them to improve it directly in AOSP. Let's hope they come up with that in a future android release

15:00:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> You can use it on a browswr

15:16:19 <chris42[m]> Is there a way to deactivate the fingerprint reader when the screen is off? I too often turn the phone on in my pocket, by accidently touching the reader.
15:17:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​xoec> I didn't ask you an advise on that

15:27:38 <entry1[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Jxoec> But you can change that"> Because it is a built-in feature to AOSP and has nothing to do with connecting to a cell network. Spoofing an IMEI would mean using someone else's as they are all registered to a device. Mac addresses can be spoofed to anything within the parameters.

17:14:30 <jay46> I am trying to load graphene onto my Pixel 5 using the web installer. I followed the steps up to the unlock bootloader. I click on that unlock bootloader button and the little windown pops up, I plug in my Pixel 5 and it shows up, I pick it, and hit the Connect button, .... then on the webpage of the web installer at the bottom of the sub section
17:14:31 <jay46> for unlocking the bootloader, an error message shows up in all red letters saying "Error: The device must be opened first."   I have tried repeating steps multiple times and get same error. Would appreciate some help. Thank you.
17:16:25 <faxing[m]> Your device is unlocked when you run that step, yes?
17:17:01 <jay46> yes. opened developer options, enabled oem, restarted the phone into fastboot mode
17:19:36 <strcat[m]> jay46: make sure you don't have something like adb running in the background
17:19:43 <strcat[m]> make sure you have a single instance of the web installer open
17:20:02 <strcat[m]> I suggest rebooting both your computer and the phone in case you've done something to screw this up
17:20:41 <jay46> single instance of web installer for sure, how do I make sure I dont have adb running in background?
17:21:19 <jay46> phones even been reset since I unlocked bootloader and relocked it with fastboot... i guess i actually never rebooted the laptop so I will try that in a second
17:22:33 <jay46> seems simple enough to know how to make sure adb is not running but i dont, but well, i dont . ;)  im on ubuntu too
17:25:24 <jay46> i hit ps aux and didnt see anything that looked like adb but not 1000 percent certain.. ill restart my computer and see what happens this time
17:34:45 <sjsndnjdejd> <jay46 "single instance of web installer"> adb kill-server
17:35:50 <jay46> in terminal i typed      adb kill-server  and it gave me -- cannot connect to daemon at tcp:5037: Connection refused
17:37:14 <zzxx123_> This means adb is not running
17:37:26 <jay46> restarted computer and went into web installer and go the same error when picked pixel 5 in the small unlock bootloader window it gave me in red text Error: The device must be opened first.
17:37:34 <jay46> ok
17:38:24 <Rin[m]> jay46 tried "adb devices"
17:39:14 <Rin[m]> Also, might wanna enable usb debugging in developer options
17:39:22 <jay46> i am nervous to try following the instructions on the command line installation instructions instead, even though I got fastboot to unlock and relock the bootloader last night..  a touch nervous since having this error with web installer ill have some other issue following the command line install and some slight posibility i get a bricked phone
17:40:10 <jay46> i actually tried that lastnight but ill try it again.. since i reset phone to factory settings by unlocking and relockign bootloater with fastboot i havent tried it so i will agan but last night when i was going through this that didt work
17:40:11 <Rin[m]> Does your phone show up when you do : ad devices in console/cmd
17:40:25 <Rin[m]> adb devices*
17:40:36 <Rin[m]> * Does your phone show up when you do : adb devices in console/cmd
17:42:05 <jay46> just type into terminal "adb devices" and get response list of devices attached and then a blank line and command prompt again
17:42:32 <jay46> so nothing there.. but it shows it in the little window in web installer and lets me pick the pixel 5 but gives hat error when i hit connect
17:42:52 <jay46> unless i am not doing that adb devices into command prompt thing you asked me to try right
17:43:59 <jay46> fuck me.. this web installer seemed like it was going to be smooth... been making sure i had everything on my phone backed up and ready to do this... and then shit just has to be difficult for me
17:44:31 <strcat[m]> you are not supposed to use adb
17:44:44 <strcat[m]> jay46: please stop what you're doing
17:45:07 <strcat[m]> jay46: you aren't following the official guide, this is your problem
17:45:20 <jay46> thats not true.. what are you talking about i read every single word like 10 times
17:45:26 <jay46> followed every single instruction
17:45:36 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be using adb
17:45:42 <jay46> the only adb anything i did is what someone just asked me to try.. on this help forum
17:45:56 <strcat[m]> not everything people say here is correct or advisable
17:46:07 <strcat[m]> you need to start by rebooting your computer and the phone
17:46:23 <strcat[m]> remove whatever adb / fastboot stuff you installed and make sure it's not running
17:46:24 <jay46> everythings been rebooted ... phone more times that i can remember.. laptop i just did
17:46:27 <strcat[m]> that's likely your issue
17:46:49 <strcat[m]> jay46: use the web installer
17:48:40 <jay46> how do i remove adb ..... i havent used linux a ton.. i know its on there but i dont know the simple command to remove adb
17:48:58 <jay46> or fastboot...
17:49:39 <strcat[m]> how did you get them?
17:50:00 <strcat[m]> do you have macOS or Windows?
17:50:06 <jay46> command line install.. i ubuntu
17:51:19 <strcat[m]> the CLI install isn't going to resolve any issues for you
17:51:33 <strcat[m]> you'll hit whatever problem you're hitting via the web install
17:51:46 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't sound like you're familiar with CLI so you're making things harder
17:52:15 <strcat[m]> I recommend using the web installer and making sure to follow everything it says
17:52:29 <strcat[m]> you haven't made it clear if you've done that
17:52:39 <strcat[m]> did you deal with this? https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-as-non-root
17:52:51 <strcat[m]> did you read the info about USB here? https://grapheneos.org/install/web#prerequisites
17:53:04 <strcat[m]> use web installer + provide more info that's needed to help
17:53:08 <strcat[m]> need to say what you've done
17:53:13 <jay46> I promise you i have followed every single word and step of that install... its not that complicated
17:54:43 <jay46> computer has prerequisites... i have adk tools package.. i set OEM in developer tools ... everything
17:54:55 <strcat> jay46: so can you please clarify that? do you have the udev rules? how are you connecting it with USB?
17:56:13 <jay46> android-sdk-platform-tools-common is already the newest version (27.0.0+12).
17:56:27 <jay46> is making sure that is there... same as making sure i have the udev rules?
17:56:46 <strcat[m]> okay so how are you connecting it with USB
17:56:47 <strcat[m]> ?
17:56:56 <strcat[m]> what kind of computer is it, what kind of USB cable are you using, what kind of port are you using?
17:56:59 <strcat[m]> that's necessary info
17:57:01 <jay46> I have a cable usb-c to usb-a that says right on a package I still have USB DATA CABLE Fast Transmission
17:57:09 <strcat[m]> okay so that's probably the issue
17:57:26 <strcat[m]> if possible use the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes with the phone
17:57:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f​lyingduckall> I just procured two cheap second hand pixels to convert for a friend and myself this weekend,  here to give a shout-out to strcat saying thank you for obvious reasons. That's all, happy secure android weekend y'all.
17:57:38 <strcat[m]> otherwise you need to have a high end, made to spec USB-A to USB-C cable
17:57:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Granville (@G​ranvilleGutkowski) has joined the Telegram Group!
17:57:51 <strcat[m]> most USB-A to USB-C cables do not actually work properly
17:57:57 <jay46> fuck me.. my computer has no Usb C input
17:57:57 <strcat[m]> so that's probably your issue
17:58:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​ranvilleGutkowski> is this official now?
17:58:09 <strcat[m]> you need a proper USB-A to USB-C cable then
17:58:15 <strcat[m]> Telegram is semi-official right now
17:58:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​ranvilleGutkowski> what does that mean?
17:58:37 <jay46> even if the phone will let me use fastboot to unlock the bootloader...  ???  that doesnt mean anything as for the cable working?
17:59:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​ranvilleGutkowski> i saw daniel's tweet about the telegram group
17:59:56 <GJMFS> Anyone know of a recent issue with Signal notifications not working since the most recent patch yesterday? Rebooted to apply the update and Signal notifications have not worked since.
18:00:34 <strcat[m]> there's no issue with it
18:01:01 <strcat[m]> sounds more like you have notifications disabled for Signal or via DnD
18:01:58 <jay46> ill try someone elses computer that has a usb-c cable ... think i can do that in the next little while and hopefully it works... thanks for time..

18:29:13 <marsgoals[m]> Hello all, I've done plenty of research on using a VPN w GrapheneOS and I still have not landed on a best solution. I know that it is recommended to enter the credentials from my VPN provider (mine is ProtonVPN) into the settings on the phone. I know that I should turn on 'always on VPN & 'Block connections not using VPN'. Doesn't that solution make it difficult to switch between servers if the server gets bogged
18:29:13 <marsgoals[m]> down? How do I see if it is bogged down? Should I enter multiple addresses from my VPN provider into the phone settings so I can easily switch? Do I have to do the same type of setup for every user on my phone? Or, should I setup 'Orbot: Tor for Android' for each user and just leave it at that? Thanks :)
18:31:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​xoec> Allow data transfer via usb
18:32:07 <usernumber33[m]> <jj1013 "usernumber33: So I can not set t"> So the user doesn't "set" the encryption key for file encryption. It derived by the OS.
18:33:32 <strcat[m]> marsgoals: if you want to switch between servers use their app and enable always on + block connections
18:44:45 <marsgoals[m]> Thanks strcat. I'm trying to set phones up for some friends also. I know that you don't like to recommend specific providers, I get that, but I'd like to have a standard format that I can use to set up phones for others who may not have a paid VPN provider as I do. I'd also like to assure others that I've done everything possible to give them the absolute best setup. There seem to be so many options that people are
18:44:45 <marsgoals[m]> using here; IVPN, OpenVPN, Orbot, using the phone VPN settings, the list ends at infinitum. lol. What is the best solution??? Thanks
18:45:29 <bizanon[m]> Someone posted freezer music app here. Just wanted to say thank you for that. Its an awesome app
18:46:46 <strcat[m]> marsgoals: it's off-topic for this channel, VPN provider recommendations don't belong here
18:46:55 <strcat[m]> and I won't give you a VPN provider recommendation
18:47:22 <strcat[m]> or ipsec (with a provider properly supporting it in a secure way) or wireguard
18:47:28 <strcat[m]> won't recommend a provider
18:50:58 <chris42[m]> Is there a way to deactivate the fingerprint sensor when the display is off? I too often turn the phone on by mistake
18:51:02 <marsgoals[m]> OK. So the only recommendation is to use the VPN in he phone settings? Thanks :)
18:52:07 <marsgoals[m]> Adn what channel should I be using for questions? What specifically is this channel for?
18:53:27 <alex-resist> There is #grapheneos-offtopic
18:53:29 <strcat[m]> marsgoals: use ipsec (built-in) with a provider that uses it securely, or use the wireguard app
18:53:57 <strcat[m]> marsgoals: or use a high quality VPN provider app presumably using wireguard if you want more configuration
18:53:57 <strcat[m]> and yeah
18:54:01 <strcat[m]> off-topic as stated earlier

19:01:38 <jay46> think i just broke my phone trying to install grapheneos
19:01:49 <strcat[m]> jay46: doubt it
19:01:57 <jay46> it had an error during install
19:02:04 <strcat[m]> alright, doubt you broke the phone
19:02:08 <strcat[m]> no reason to think that you did
19:02:24 <strcat[m]> jay46: as I said earlier, use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
19:02:28 <strcat[m]> please read the information there on USB
19:02:29 <jay46> i tried and tried to install it but during writing system ext it had an error: timeout exceeded 2500ms
19:02:34 <braxtono[m]> Has anyone managed to break a graphene phone yet?
19:02:38 <jay46> but this is where i fucked up
19:02:42 <jay46> i mean bricked it
19:02:43 <strcat[m]> > You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports on a laptop.
19:02:43 <strcat[m]> Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.
19:02:50 <strcat[m]> jay46: it's not bricked
19:03:02 <strcat[m]> jay46: go back to the bootloader interface, complete the install with a proper USB cable
19:03:07 <jay46> i used someone elses computer...  and cord worked usb c to usc b
19:03:16 <jay46> a new macbook pro
19:03:33 <jay46> but after having that error multiple times this is where i did the dumbest thing
19:03:54 <jay46> i thought i cant just keep boring this guys computer he has to work... it looks maybe like it could of actually installed.. so i locked bootloader
19:04:08 <jay46> and now it says no operating system wont boot and wont be recognized by computer any more
19:04:19 <strcat[m]> jay46: it's not bricked
19:04:34 <jay46> thank god if you are right and please help me.. and I am sorry
19:04:35 <strcat[m]> jay46: follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web again
19:04:46 <strcat[m]> jay46: nothing extra we can tell you here that's not in the guide
19:04:55 <braxtono[m]> One thing I noticed, if flash fails halfway it needs the same os to refinish ie if I started Linux and it failed to reconnect after resetting during flash I was stuck in fastboot menu and couldn't use windows to finish ; was unrecognizable so I needed another Linux (or Ubuntu) to finish . dunno if that's a difference between fastboot versions
19:05:00 <strcat[m]> jay46: you need to start at the beginning again since you locked, so you need to unlock again
19:05:01 <chris42[m]> <catfish[m] "Settings > Display > Lock Screen"> Thx. I activated that toggle. But it does nothing? Text says it will enable an BB option. Where is it then?😳
19:05:12 <strcat[m]> braxtono: that's definitely not accurate
19:05:22 <strcat[m]> braxtono: you didn't follow the guide properly on Windows
19:05:28 <strcat[m]> following the guide correctly is how you install
19:05:33 <strcat[m]> you cannot skip sections or important info
19:05:47 <jay46> Wont leave a black screen which says cant find a valid operating system.  It will not bring up the bootloader screen at all. Will not boot the phpne.
19:05:56 <strcat[m]> you skipped installing the driver on Windows and didn't have automatic optional updates enabled
19:06:01 <strcat[m]> so, yeah, it didn't work
19:06:06 <strcat[m]> totally expected, and covered there
19:06:22 <strcat[m]> jay46: it's not bricked, you're just not booting it into the bootloader interface
19:06:29 <strcat[m]> jay46: stop panicking, stop deviating from the guide
19:06:32 <jay46> sorry.. i freaked.
19:06:36 <usernumber33[m]> <chris42[m] "Thx. I activated that toggle. Bu"> Hold down the power button for a few seconds
19:06:39 <strcat[m]> jay46: okay, follow the guide
19:06:54 <jay46> i am sorry. i got the fastboot screen back up with the volume down.. i just figured the worst could happen to me if it happens!
19:07:01 <strcat[m]> jay46: would almost certainly have worked properly from a macbook with the cable that comes with the phone
19:07:02 <jay46> going to go back and just try again...
19:07:11 <strcat[m]> jay46: which phone model is it
19:07:20 <jay46> should of but three times with i went to the install part it did that timeout error .. Pixel 5
19:08:01 <strcat[m]> were you interrupting the install by doing something with the menu on the phone?
19:08:09 <jay46> Writing System . does that for a bit then ERROR: Timeout 2500 ms exceeded       -- and it just stops. I can repush that level of instal, did 3 times, same error
19:08:13 <strcat[m]> make sure to leave the browser tab with the installer open and active
19:08:27 <jay46> didnt touch phone and made sure even the computers screen wouldnt go to black
19:09:07 <jay46> did that too.. doing nothing at all on the computer but watching it
19:09:20 <jay46> one graphene install page watching progresss
19:09:23 <jay46> on
19:09:55 <strcat[m]> plug it into a different USB port
19:10:06 <strcat[m]> reboot the phone to the bootloader interface, reboot the computer
19:10:10 <strcat[m]> use one of the supported browsers
19:10:35 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Don't use incognito mode
19:10:52 <jay46> I can go in there one more time, reboot the computer, okay, ill go one more time at it and come back hopefully with good news... sorry for freakout..
19:11:03 <jay46> be back soon hopefully only good news
19:11:15 <Rin[m]> Disable any plugins that might cause issue as well
19:13:22 <chris42[m]> <usernumber33[m] "Hold down the power button for a"> Turn off screen now has a lock option and three dots, which will show screenshot. But no additional options
19:15:37 <catfish[m]> chris42 should have Lockdown option which turns off fingerprint sensor
19:17:55 <marsgoals[m]> Thank you :)
19:20:24 <interesting[m]> are there tutorial on how the backup works? on graphene website.
19:20:24 <interesting[m]> there's this backup with 12 words passphrase, but i'm afraid to proceed before I read tutorial on how to do it or something
19:20:49 <strcat[m]> interesting: it's an app called Seedvault
19:20:58 <strcat[m]> which is integrating as the backup service in the OS
19:20:59 <chris42[m]> <catfish[m] "chris42 should have Lockdown opt"> Nope, I have emergency, lock, on/off and three dots that offer screenshot
19:21:09 <interesting[m]> can i read up on it somewhere
19:21:15 <strcat[m]> it backs up OS and app data for the main profile, you have to back up your user files yourself
19:21:33 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "it backs up OS and app data for "> I see. so it's encrypted with this passphrase?
19:21:53 <strcat[m]> interesting: yes that's a BIP39 seed phrase, which provides a 128-bit entropy seed to make the keys
19:22:02 <interesting[m]> very cool
19:22:04 <strcat[m]> you write that down and it's used to decrypt when restoring
19:22:11 <interesting[m]> I see
19:22:21 <strcat[m]> I proposed doing it this way and someone in our community made the initial implementation of it
19:22:22 <interesting[m]> but i still need to save the backup file?
19:22:27 <strcat[m]> which has now evolved into Seedvault
19:22:34 <strcat[m]> interesting: yes, you would generally plug in a USB flash drive
19:22:34 <interesting[m]> I see
19:22:35 <strcat[m]> and back up to there
19:22:42 <interesting[m]> thanks
19:22:46 <strcat[m]> or use a cloud provider it supports like nextcloud
19:23:04 <strcat[m]> and then to restore, copy it from there to a USB flash drive, which you use when setting up the phone again (in SetupWizard)
19:23:18 <strcat[m]> it supports backing up to app-based storage providers
19:23:21 <strcat[m]> like nextcloud
19:23:26 <interesting[m]> can I restore it on another phone? or only same model
19:23:30 <strcat[m]> so you can have automatic encrypted backups of OS/app data to there
19:23:36 <strcat[m]> interesting: can restore on another phone, the backups are portable
19:23:41 <interesting[m]> wow
19:23:46 <interesting[m]> very nice
19:23:57 <strcat[m]> just keep in mind it only does OS data and also app data for the main profile atm
19:24:20 <interesting[m]> i see
19:24:20 <strcat[m]> you have to back up your home directory (user files you see in the file manager) yourself
19:24:20 <strcat[m]> or with an app that supports it
19:24:54 <strcat[m]> it should eventually gain support for backing that up too
19:24:58 <strcat[m]> and for backing up other profiles
19:25:05 <strcat[m]> it's a very actively developed app
19:25:14 <interesting[m]> I see
19:25:22 <strcat[m]> you'd have to set it up in each user profile you want backed up
19:25:28 <strcat[m]> atm it only supports the main profile
19:25:36 <strcat[m]> but I mean, in the future
19:25:47 <interesting[m]> main profile is fine
19:30:17 <catfish[m]> <chris42[m] "Nope, I have emergency, lock, on"> Can't help more bud, works here
19:31:04 <Rin[m]> Btw People, how do you feel graphene is vs stock in terms of performance? I've heard it's a bit slower but less battery drain as well
19:31:23 <chris42[m]> <catfish[m] "Can't help more bud, works here"> No worries, thx. Is it device specific? I am on a Pixel 5
19:32:11 <dannyknoll3[m]> Rin: No noticeable lag on, well, anything, and the days of battery would make me CHOOSE some lag even if there was.
19:40:05 <strcat[m]> Rin: https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning
19:40:27 <strcat[m]> we use a secure application spawning model resulting in apps needing a bit more time to start in order for each app to be better isolated
19:40:38 <strcat[m]> but that only adds a bit of time to cold start
19:40:44 <strcat[m]> once it's started/cached, doesn't have a performance impact
19:41:15 <strcat[m]> memory usage per app is significantly higher due to security features requiring memory usage (memory quarantines) so not as many things can be cached, the phones have so much memory now though
19:41:50 <strcat[m]> and C and C++ code that is heavily bounded by malloc (vast majority of code is not) is slowed down as part of hardening against memory corruption
19:41:51 <strcat[m]> some other features have a minor cost too
19:41:53 <strcat[m]> anyway that's the point of GrapheneOS
19:41:58 <strcat[m]> suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/features
19:42:10 <strcat[m]> if you don't want privacy and security enhancements like these, probably not the OS for you
19:43:12 <strcat[m]> the standard application spawning model is faster because it takes a shortcut leaking sensitive info to apps
19:44:17 <strcat[m]> the 3 major initial GrapheneOS features when it was first started as a project in 2014 were the secure application spawning model, OpenBSD malloc (now replaced with our superior in-house malloc implementation) and PaX kernel hardening
20:03:38 <strcat[m]> going to be making a new release soon with the new Vanadium and other changes
20:18:35 <jay46> Got GrapheneOS Installed !!
20:19:42 <strcat[m]> nice
20:19:44 <jay46> On the macbook pro I used, it has two left side usbc ports, and it just took switching to the one furthest back to get the writing sys ext timeout error to stop
20:21:16 <jay46> When i was previously getting that error, over and again, I was bothering someone for their comptuer when they needed to work, so i locked the bootloader and hoped it would load or even to stock, and when it didnt, it seemed like I bricked the phone for a moment because it wasnt on fastboot any more.. freaked out like you saw, then just did the
20:21:17 <jay46> volume down button thing and got it back...
20:22:21 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "going to be making a new release"> Oh what of changes do you have in mind?
20:22:35 <blacklight447[m]> The only i thing i personally miss one vanadium is an always private browsing mode
20:22:47 <jay46> thanks for your help.
20:22:51 <blacklight447[m]> Tldr if i close the browser or tab, the data saved locally is gone
20:22:57 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: that's wanted and just hasn't been implemented yet
20:23:16 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: always incognito is different than a clear on exit feature btw
20:24:38 <bill_in_mtl[m]> <strcat[m] "blacklight447: always incognito "> Clear on exit would be good
20:25:56 <mcrabble> First time user, just opened the calendar app and...  literally don't know how to use it.  It's a calendar app, what am I missing?
20:26:52 <strcat[m]> mcrabble: it's not meant to be used
20:27:02 <strcat[m]> we're hiding the launcher icon in the next release to avoid confusion
20:27:14 <strcat[m]> install the calendar app of your choice like Etar and use that
20:27:22 <skagreek[m]> strcat: Hi. Curious if the new Vanadium might get a bookmark import? Would love to ditch Brave. Thanks.
20:27:28 <strcat[m]> skagreek: no
20:27:35 <skagreek[m]> OK thanks.
20:27:35 <strcat[m]> you can see what changes I was talking about
20:27:48 <strcat[m]> there isn't some major list of arbitrary changes
20:27:53 <strcat[m]> no need to ask what changed you can look
20:28:18 <skagreek[m]> Will do.
20:29:26 <mcrabble> strcat[m]: cool, thanks.  Also just as an aside, the documentation on the website is great, kudos
20:30:07 <mr_hebi_san[m]> mcrabble almost every app on Graphene is the AOSP default version.  Reading up on the default AOSP apps would be illuminating.
20:30:39 <strcat[m]> skagreek: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/ac72936ed10ca7aced7e3a0e7d34eaf50b5fd00b/static/releases.html#L435-L445
20:30:45 <strcat[m]> you can also look at the pending changes for the next release
20:30:54 <strcat[m]> since they're added to that repo as they're landed in the main branch
20:31:19 <skagreek[m]> Awesome, was looking for it in the element search. Appreciate it.
20:36:01 <strcat[m]> skagreek: you can look at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/static/releases.html (most recent revision) at the part where changelogs are added
20:36:05 <strcat[m]> and the pending one is there
20:37:34 <strcat[m]> recently we've been heavily focused on defending against the attacks on the project and on infrastructure stuff
20:37:44 <strcat[m]> so not much actually happening with privacy/security work on the OS lately
20:37:45 <strcat[m]> unfortunately
20:37:47 <strcat[m]> but that will change
20:50:06 <Lestat[m]> So im here about hardened_malloc
20:52:36 <Lestat[m]> im working on void linux security and i wanted to use hardened_malloc (before you say its offtopic Daniel has shown interest in helping with building musl and glibc with hardened_malloc). The best way to do that would be to build musl with hardened_malloc. Sadly when i tried doing that it wouldnt compile and give errors about stuff like stdatomic.h not existing (didnt happen when i built it alone) so i decided to seek
20:52:37 <Lestat[m]> some help here
20:53:48 <Lestat[m]> I personally currently work on a hardened kernel but i would gladly add musl with hardened_malloc to the list
20:56:03 <madaidan[m]> There's an off topic channel.
20:57:02 <dannyknoll3[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org

20:57:51 <Lestat[m]> Ok
21:00:16 <kevinpigar> Hi
21:00:16 <Lestat[m]> Sorry!
21:00:44 <kevinpigar> Im new with pixel (pixel5) I have just installed GrapheneOS and when I try to verify it says my device is not locked but in fact it is
21:13:18 <strcat[m]> well unfortunately they left prematurely
21:13:24 <strcat[m]> can't help people if they don't give time to respond
21:13:53 <strcat[m]> if Auditor says the device isn't locked it presumably isn't locked
21:14:03 <rinkamin[m]> Man our country online ID for banking and other stuff warned it would work withoutnplau services, clicked away the warning and it worked anyway.
21:14:07 <strcat[m]> maybe a mistake during the installation process where they thought they locked it but didn't
21:14:19 <strcat[m]> rinkamin: that's pretty common
21:14:19 <rinkamin[m]> The warning starts every time you boot the app but still worka
21:14:27 <rinkamin[m]> * The warning starts every time you boot the app but still works
21:14:33 <strcat[m]> rinkamin: there's a standard warning boilerplate apps reuse
21:14:35 <strcat[m]> copy paste
21:14:52 <rinkamin[m]> I wouldn't have been able to stay on graphene without it working
21:14:53 <pinkylittlecat[m> none of my bank apps work, what a great world we live in -_-
21:14:54 <strcat[m]> they probably don't actually have a hard dependency on the functionality but rather just certain features do
21:14:54 <rinkamin[m]> Xd
21:16:09 <pinkylittlecat[m> how do you guys get around this? i wanted to centralize all my personal things into a grapheneOS phone, i suppose i am not supposed to use bank apps then? or maybe i just like in a very shitty place without decent banks
21:16:20 <rinkamin[m]> Here its extremely common to use an app called swish. As long as two users have the app, they can send money to each other, without fee, instant transaction, just by knowing each others phone nr
21:16:26 <rinkamin[m]> Dunno
21:16:37 <rinkamin[m]> Maybe use them in browser?
21:19:40 <rinkamin[m]> Or a secondary, really cheap phone for banking appa
21:19:47 <rinkamin[m]> * Or a secondary, really cheap phone for banking apps
21:19:56 <rinkamin[m]> Like one of those 50$ once
21:23:38 <dannyknoll3[m]> <rinkamin[m] "Maybe use them in browser?"> If your bank doesn't have a webapp at this stage, or their app has Google Services hard dependency, I'd be concerned and switch.
21:26:06 <rinkamin[m]> The issue in my case would have been if the app used for authorization (basically your ID card in your phone) wouldn't have worked. I would have to carry around

21:53:16 <rinkamin[m]> Its support my language layout but no spell checking/dictionary
21:57:57 <Thatcher[m]> Can system updates be applied in Secondary User profiles, or do I have to switch back to owner profile?
22:00:32 <HowardR> What does it mean and what can I do if my Pixel5 redfin build output looks like this https://i.imgur.com/ObFE9hO.png
22:08:45 <fast1[m]> <jay46 "theres no getting rid of that no"> Just disable it
22:10:39 <sjsndnjdejd> <HowardR "What does it mean and what can I"> mean you probably built the wrong target
22:20:20 <nscnt[m]> Thatcher: It'll work if you're in a secondary user. You won't get any feedback while being in the secondary profile, though.
22:20:24 <bbhead[m]> How/Where do I report issues for beta on 4a?
22:21:24 <nscnt[m]> bbhead: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues

22:33:23 <rinkamin[m]> * Kinda wish some of the stock apps like phone/clock etc wasn't 10 years old
22:38:50 <Thatcher[m]> <rinkamin[m] "Kinda wish some of the stock app"> Those apps may be old, but they served a great purpose during George Washington's presidency.
22:52:05 <strcat[m]> kitbanza: those are both actively maintained in AOSP so don't know what you mean by that
22:52:59 <strcat[m]> bbhead: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/478 could be a symptom of us removing the workaround for the audio ordering bug which we thought must have been solved upstream
22:53:09 <strcat[m]> we've repeatedly asked for feedback on whether everything is working fine
22:53:15 <strcat[m]> bbhead: how long has this not been working for you?
22:53:26 <strcat[m]> we barely get feedback from people so it's very hard to know if us dropping that workaround was fine
22:53:47 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.02.23.15
22:53:55 <strcat[m]> it was 2021.02.23.15 where we dropped the workaround
22:54:09 <strcat[m]> we added back the Pixel 3 and 3 XL camera one, but not the audio ordering one, because we had no reports of issues
22:54:26 <strcat[m]> the problem is now, it has been a significant time since that release, so now it's pretty hard to know what caused it
22:54:29 <strcat[m]> that's why we need quick feedback
22:54:41 <strcat[m]> can't really do much to address it now beyond starting over with the debugging process
22:54:47 <strcat[m]> even though it could simply be the same issue as before
23:08:29 <strcat[m]> @room we need feedback on whether external audio devices are working properly for people since the 2021.02.23.15 release particularly using assorted Bluetooth devices, headphones, etc.
23:08:54 <strcat[m]> @room we aren't getting the feedback necessary and I need people to report whether they are having problems with their Bluetooth audio devices or whether it is working fine
23:09:46 <Elmo[m]> <strcat[m] "and you won't be able to use tha"> My Airpods have been working perfectly.
23:10:00 <AppAraat[m]> strcat: I did have trouble making an external DAC work through a microUSB <-> USB-C adapter, though I'm unsure whether it's even supposed to work.
23:10:10 <codebam> I'll grab my wireless headphones and test right now
23:10:26 <Elmo[m]> My Airpods have been working perfectly.
23:10:26 <isavotoast[m]> ^
23:10:40 <Stephen[m]> <strcat[m] "@room we aren't getting the feed"> All typical bluetooth devices for me are working
23:10:41 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: that sounds like something non-standard / broken, either the adapter or DAC is broken, also make sure to plug it when unlocked
23:10:41 <cyberparty> Charging my headset now
23:10:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Whats the best way to give you feedback ?
23:10:58 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: it's more likely that's a USB issue or the device is broken
23:10:59 <tidria[m]> I've tested two different USB C DACs and one BT Speaker without issue. I have a BT headset with a mic I can test tonight
23:11:07 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: just because USB is so screwed up
23:11:17 <Stephen[m]> USB DAC working ok for me
23:11:18 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: i.e. if it's not actually a USB-C digital audio DAC I wouldn't expect it to work anyway
23:11:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Same
23:11:40 <strcat[m]> also keep in mind USB devices need to be plugged in when unlocked (or currently, at boot) on GrapheneOS
23:11:46 <AppAraat[m]> strcat: device itself works when connecting to laptop, but yeah the way I understood is that external DACs under Android is a hit or miss game.
23:11:51 <codebam> working fine with my sony bluetooth headphones
23:12:04 <codebam> pixel 5
23:12:04 <AppAraat[m]> oh, I haven't tried plugging it in at boot, hmm...
23:12:09 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: well it deliberately focuses on standard USB-C digital audio rather than non-standard stuff requiring drivers
23:12:15 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: no you don't need to plug it in at boot
23:12:34 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: I'm saying you need to plug it in when *unlocked* by default, with the *exception* that it will also work if already plugged in at boot
23:12:46 <AppAraat[m]> oh I see
23:13:08 <strcat[m]> because the threat model for that feature is defending the device after profiles are unlocked / made active post-boot
23:13:08 <AppAraat[m]> Stephen: which one do you have?
23:13:24 <Stephen[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Stephen: which one do you have?"> 3xl
23:13:27 <falkensmaze[m]> Airpods 2nd gen (2019) work just fine on Pixel 4a
23:13:50 <AppAraat[m]> <Stephen[m] "3xl"> Hmm, I have a Chord Mojo. Does yours work in class compliant mode?
23:14:05 <strcat[m]> does anyone use Bluetooth car audio, does that work fine since 2021.02.23.15?
23:14:17 <strcat[m]> it seems to me that if we still needed that workaround more people would be having issues than just 1 report so far
23:14:26 <chris42[m]> USB headset is working for me on Pixel 5. Mic and audio. Remote functions like volume as well
23:14:38 <strcat[m]> because back when we added the workaround, a lot of people had problems with external audio, maybe primarily bluetooth audio
23:14:47 <chris42[m]> For Bluetooth I need to check tomorrow
23:14:50 <strcat[m]> the issue people used to have was audio playing out of wrong speakers primarily
23:15:07 <strcat[m]> also btw
23:15:16 <strcat[m]> please test after rebooting, and then again after rebooting, etc.
23:15:18 <strcat[m]> as many times as you can
23:15:37 <strcat[m]> the issue that used to happen is the AOSP audio system had an ordering bug where it depended on malloc address order
23:15:54 <strcat[m]> so hardened_malloc fine-grained randomization would randomly break it and it'd play out of wrong speakers
23:16:06 <strcat[m]> need to know if anyone is having that issue again since 2021.02.23.15 (or similar issues)
23:16:27 <dannyknoll3[m]> <strcat[m] "does anyone use Bluetooth car au"> I do not, but will temporarily on my partner's car, to test ASAP.
23:16:27 <strcat[m]> it seems like no, so far, and that this new bug report (may not be a bug) is unrelated
23:16:36 <strcat[m]> but remains to be seen really
23:16:39 <donkykong[m]> I've got the latest update and both the USB hands hands free and audio jack hands free is working good😁
23:16:46 <Stephen[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Hmm, I have a Chord Mojo. Does y"> I just have the default pixel USB DAC that comes with the phone
23:16:57 <strcat[m]> oh and most important thing to test would probably be phone calls while using Bluetooth audio
23:17:07 <strcat[m]> that seems to be the main thing people used to have issues with
23:17:18 <Stephen[m]> strcat will test tonight
23:17:33 <cyberparty> My Sony Bluetooth headphones appear to be fine.
23:17:38 <AppAraat[m]> <strcat[m] "the issue people used to have wa"> Oh! This reminds me of a bug with Element Android. If I'd enable audio via speakerphone, it would stay stuck that way until reboot. I always thought it was an Element client bug.
23:17:47 <cyberparty> (Pixel 4a, latest build)
23:17:58 <cyberparty> Will test bluetooth phonecall
23:18:04 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: that's probably an Element bug
23:18:23 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: this prior issue was it'd play out of USB instead of phone speakers, or vice versa, or similar with Bluetooth
23:18:41 <strcat[m]> I don't think speaker phone type stuff was impacted since that's more of an application thing not an OS audio thing
23:18:42 <DC[m]> No problems with Bluetooth on latest stable on Pixel 4.
23:19:27 <AppAraat[m]> strcat: but it would also affect stuff like normal phone calls.
23:19:28 <strcat[m]> well it does sound like it's working for most people and I'd expect it'd be broken for more people if the old issue was back
23:19:44 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: yeah but what I mean is the old issue was an issue with external audio devices
23:19:51 <strcat[m]> Element is really buggy and that just sounds like an application issue
23:20:23 <AppAraat[m]> oh ok, hmm. I'll try to find some BT audio devices and test those then.
23:21:11 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: so basically issue was there was a list of audio devices
23:21:17 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: and the active one is supposed to be 1st
23:21:29 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to be ordered a certain way
23:21:33 <isavotoast[m]> Blue tooth earbuds work just fine for thorium ,the peer tube client
23:21:35 <strcat[m]> and it expects that order to be reliable
23:21:48 <strcat[m]> and if it isn't, then it'd play audio (or record audio) out of the wrong device
23:22:02 <strcat[m]> and I mean device like phone, USB headset, bluetooth headset, bluetooth speakers, etc.
23:22:15 <strcat[m]> if the device has multiple mics/speakers, there wasn't an issue with choosing the right ones
23:22:17 <donkykong[m]> <strcat[m] "oh and most important thing to t"> Yea blue tooth calls works good also 4a latest build
23:22:19 <isavotoast[m]> Could try with my blue tooth Bose and Milwaukee speakers if y'all want
23:22:19 <strcat[m]> the issue was with using right device
23:22:25 <strcat[m]> so we applied a workaround
23:22:27 <strcat[m]> kept it for a long time
23:22:28 <isavotoast[m]> Or another app
23:22:32 <strcat[m]> and recently last month removed the workaround
23:22:38 <strcat[m]> just trying to figure out if it was correct to remove the workaround
23:22:48 <cyberparty> Just tested phone call on my sony bluetooth speakers on Pixel 4a on latest build. Everything works fine, including microphone and speakers.
23:22:51 <strcat[m]> I think it seems that it isn't causing issues for most people
23:22:59 <strcat[m]> so the bug is probably fixed as we thought
23:23:13 <strcat[m]> the new bug report may not actually be a bug, may be just Bluetooth sucking
23:23:17 <isavotoast[m]> This is via pixel 5. Someone ping me if you want
23:23:28 <strcat[m]>  * the new bug report may not actually be a bug, may be just Bluetooth devices suck
23:23:39 <strcat[m]> isavotoast: yeah it'd be good to test
23:24:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Would using a hardware key for stuff like OTP using an OTG cable work on android aswell or should I ask that in offtopic?
23:25:13 <bill_in_mtl[m]> I use my Bluetooth ear pods everyday - no issues to report
23:25:14 <AppAraat[m]> Unrelated: My P3a was still on RQ1A.210105.002 - Only now did it show me there was an update after manually going to system updates and checking.
23:25:31 <bill_in_mtl[m]> * I use my Bluetooth ear pods everyday - no issues to report - pixel 4a
23:25:41 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: the new release is fairly new
23:25:51 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: the Updater automatically checks for updates every 4 hours unless you force stopped it
23:25:58 <strcat[m]> so you should have gotten it by now, that's kinda weird
23:26:03 <strcat[m]> maybe you force stopped it?
23:26:24 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: is it possible it did the update and you just weren't on the owner profile to see the notification? *shrug*
23:26:44 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: release you're talking about is quite old... that's January
23:26:56 <AppAraat[m]> Did not force stop it. Also only have 1 profile. Could the update process be battery optimized?
23:27:06 <SkyKing> f droid refuses to attempt to download/install nextcloud
23:27:12 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: it has battery optimizations disabled
23:27:17 <strcat[m]> SkyKing: refresh F-Droid repositories
23:27:22 <AppAraat[m]> Hmm, that's pretty weird then.
23:27:25 <fomijafi[m]> <strcat[m] "@room we aren't getting the feed"> Bluetooth audio in my vehicle working fine on Pixel 3. Haven't tested a phone call tho
23:27:27 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: did you have battery saver mode on? it's possible that would cause it
23:27:39 <SkyKing> good idea didn't know you had to manually do that. let me check.
23:27:40 <skwisgaar[m]> No issues with bluetooth headphones on 3 XL
23:27:55 <AppAraat[m]> I did not switch it on, but I do remember it automatically switching on after low battery (but that was ages ago)
23:28:22 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: it just sounds like you must have force stopped it
23:28:24 <strcat[m]> at some point
23:28:50 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: force stop unregisters scheduled jobs (which it re-registers after each reboot)
23:29:10 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: and I mean 2 months ago
23:29:17 <strcat[m]> and then not rebooted since then?
23:29:27 <AppAraat[m]> I also rebooted my phone multiple times during these 2 months.
23:29:48 <strcat[m]> well that's pretty strange can't explain why the automatic check every 4 hours wouldn't be working
23:30:31 <AppAraat[m]> What is the automatic updater process called?
23:30:44 <dannyknoll3[m]> Any options used in Permitted Networks/ disabling on metered connections used, AppAraat ?
23:31:36 <AppAraat[m]> Permitted networks: Any
23:32:20 <strcat[m]> the permitted networks thing applies to 'check for updates' too
23:32:26 <strcat[m]> check for updates just schedules a job to run ASAP
23:32:45 <strcat[m]> it already has a job scheduled to run every ~4 hours (when conditions for it are acceptable)
23:34:30 <AppAraat[m]> ok so, Seamless Update Client has all necessary permissions and is not battery optimized, but Dynamic System Updates is battery optimized. Is this expected?
23:35:16 <strcat[m]> DSU isn't a thing we use
23:35:44 <strcat[m]> we plan to further disable it beyond just not using it + removing the trusted keys for it (which we already did since it was introduced)
23:35:58 <strcat[m]> low priority
23:37:13 <AppAraat[m]> ok, so system updates happen over Seamless Update Client then? If that's the case, then I'll be monitoring it closely over the coming days.
23:52:16 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: yes, it registers a periodic job at boot, every ~4 hours, with the constraints you have configured
23:52:25 <strcat[m]> if you change constraints, it registers it again
23:52:57 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: I guess it's possible you updated and missed/dismissed the notification
23:53:04 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: and just didn't reboot but...
23:53:12 <strcat[m]> you did say you rebooted a couple times since then
23:53:14 <strcat[m]> so, doesn't make sense
