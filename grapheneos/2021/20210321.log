00:23:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> bridge server is going to reboot rn
01:16:44 <habwixnwh> hi
01:16:58 <habwixnwh> I suggest a feature
01:17:15 <habwixnwh> Tor system wide proxy
01:17:42 <habwixnwh> Tor System Wide Proxy, Network sock
01:18:17 <habwixnwh> I think Calyx OS has the Tor system Wide feature
01:18:45 <habwixnwh> pls add tor system wide
01:23:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!𝙹𝙹𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟹> Is that not already possible with Orbot?
01:24:28 <habwixnwh> ill look, Id prefer a Graphene Os perfected network condiguration
01:24:36 <habwixnwh> configuration
01:25:49 <habwixnwh> My goal is Tor system wide proxy, then connect to VPN
01:26:20 <habwixnwh> So like a 'Transparent' Tor proxy, then I can connect to a VPN
01:31:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Matt has joined the Telegram Group!
01:40:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!𝙹𝙹𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟹> I think that is not possible. Android is not developed for that.
01:52:06 <imlistic[m]> habwixnwh: couldn't you just use orbot?
02:09:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!𝙹𝙹𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟹> THAT IS JUST WHAT I SAID.
02:10:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!𝙹𝙹𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟹> habwixnwh: Orbot is already good enough.
02:51:12 <ulmirdin[m]> Routing everything through tor would make you unique, I don't think this aligns with the thread model of this project.
02:51:51 <ulmirdin[m]> This is my opinion, I don't speak for the project.
03:07:47 <undergrover[m]> Hi, recent update has the change "set GrapheneOS launcher as a default notification listener on fresh installs so that the default enabled notification integration is permitted by default like the stock OS (existing users still need to manually enable the permission for the built-in launcher)"
03:08:05 <undergrover[m]> But I am wondering where in the settings I go to enable the permission on the beta
03:13:11 <sphinx[m]> undergrover:
03:13:11 <sphinx[m]> > long press home screen, press the notification dots option, enable it
03:32:43 <hard_taffy[m]> <strcat[m] "cstrrider: app compaction / free"> How do they work? Are they automated or require interaction from the user?
03:51:39 <undergrover[m]> "qubits joined and left and joined"
03:51:39 <undergrover[m]> Truly the principle of superposition
04:11:29 * grapheneos_user_  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/CwcSOhzMzlkapmhmofFTLxkC/message.txt >
04:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> ulmirdin[m], yup, you are correct; simply forcing everything into Tor does something that should never be done, and that's to mix anonymity modes, which the Tor developers themselves say never to do. Apps that aren't Tor aware that are forced to dial out alongside apps that are can pollute your anonymity by mixing what's tactitly assumed to be clearnet over the same exit that activity assumed
04:16:22 <TheJollyRoger> to be anonymous is. This is a Very Bad Thing.
04:17:59 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS does its best to avoid implementing features that will mislead, confuse, or encourage users to do the wrong thing or make it easy to screw themselves over, so we most definitely won't be doing something like that.
04:21:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!𝙹𝙹𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟹> <habwixnwh: I think Calyx OS bas the Tor> You should also stop shilling Calyx.
04:24:16 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed. Fortunately, he seems to be disconnected!
04:29:19 <grapheneos_user_> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!𝙹𝙹𝟷𝟶𝟷𝟹> <habwixnwh: I th"> IDK I don't really think he was shilling it, just saying a feature that is in calyx
04:29:28 <grapheneos_user_> Though orbot does the same thing
04:33:48 <grapheneos_user_> And it's a bad idea anyway
04:39:24 <generalgorl> My phone didn't pass the authenticator App, I'd like to reinstall GrapheneOS, but I'm not sure how?
04:39:41 <generalgorl> *test
04:39:53 <TheJollyRoger> generalgorl: did you lock the bootloader?
04:40:11 <generalgorl> after installing it the first time, yes
04:40:46 <generalgorl> well actually i just unlocked it but it's not appearing on Chrome
04:41:11 <TheJollyRoger> generalgorl: Are you seeing a yellow text saying "Your device is loading a different operating system" when you reboot or start the phone, or an orange "Software integrity is not guaranteed" text?
04:41:26 <generalgorl> yellow
04:42:08 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Check that the clock is set correctly, I take it you're using attestation.app?
04:43:08 <TheJollyRoger> Once you're logged in to remote integrity monitoring, try reloading the page.
04:44:00 <generalgorl> oh shoot, it's set to midway island time zone, I'm not sure what any of that means, I'm not THAT technical, I did the web-based install'=(
04:44:44 <TheJollyRoger> generalgorl: No problem at all, the web-based install is how we recommend people do it these days, the commandline install is only there for historical purposes/backwards compatibility.
04:45:20 <generalgorl> oh cool
04:45:34 <TheJollyRoger> Large amounts of clock skew, or even shaking the phone a lot while it's reading the QR code can actually cause invalid results... so make sure your clock is set correctly.
04:46:13 <generalgorl> oh snap okay
04:46:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:48:35 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run, if you run into any problems there should be some others here that can help you!
04:55:20 <generalgorl> of course my other android is dead :P
05:07:42 <Eddy[m]> I never figured out the web install
05:07:51 <Eddy[m]> Buttons are hard for this boomer here
05:08:02 <Eddy[m]> CLI on top!
05:26:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Hmm
05:51:25 <zzxx123_> Clicking 4 buttons is hard work
07:07:26 <strcat> hard_taffy[m]: don't require interaction
07:08:13 <strcat> just reduces resource usage by compacting memory of bg apps and freezing CPU usage when they're not supposed to be running per existing restrictions
07:25:49 <linuxhelper> Does anyone know if their is an option for the GrapheneOS keyboard for special characters to display on the QWERTY keys (long press)?
07:25:54 <linuxhelper> there*

08:37:43 <stubbornant[m]> Hi guys, does any of you know of an open source app that I could use to shred files on my phone?
08:40:51 <Thatcher[m]> <stubbornant[m] "Hi guys, does any of you know of"> Put your phone in a Blendtec blender and turn to high speed
08:41:51 <Thatcher[m]> Or use separate user accounts for sensitive files
08:43:32 <stubbornant[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Or use separate user accounts fo"> If you use a separate user account and then delete the account, in the event that someone forces you to unlock your phone, can they see the files that were in it?
08:46:04 <Thatcher[m]> No
08:47:25 <stubbornant[m]> <Thatcher[m] "No"> I mean connecting the phone to a computer, not just opening the file manager 🙂
08:48:45 <stubbornant[m]> The adversary is not my wife 😂. I mean some bad organized  people
08:49:16 <Thatcher[m]> If it were as easy as just connecting the phone to a computer to see the data from a separate user account, the separate user would be a bit pointless
08:49:58 <Thatcher[m]> A deleted one
08:52:19 <stubbornant[m]> <Thatcher[m] "If it were as easy as just conne"> Ok that's cool. So even a forensic software could not find them if I understood you well.
08:53:31 <Thatcher[m]> <stubbornant[m] "Ok that's cool. So even a forens"> I don't know. Maybe you should try getting in trouble and reporting back here with how successful the forensic software was.
08:55:11 <Thatcher[m]> Forensic software/hardware is supposed to be cutting edge technology. No one here really knows what it is truely capable of on consumer devices like these.
08:56:17 <Thatcher[m]> Talking about shredding files and forensic software gives me a bad feeling about what's on your phone
08:56:43 <Thatcher[m]> And is off topic
08:58:32 <sphinx[m]> stubbornant: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
08:58:47 <strcat[m]> please read the FAQ section on encryption
08:59:09 <stubbornant[m]> Nothing really bad dear Thatcher, unfortunately not all the people with forensic software are Captain America 🙂
08:59:19 <stubbornant[m]> <strcat[m] "please read the FAQ section on e"> Ok thanks
09:30:08 <krosse[m]> HI. http://v.ht/lkNf29
09:30:47 <mynacol[m]> strcat
09:39:03 <stubbornant[m]> <sphinx[m] "stubbornant: https://grapheneos."> Thanks, that's clear.
09:43:40 <sphinx[m]> stubbornant:  F-Droid has an outdated apk as the main download on their site. You can't install an older version of F-Droid than you have in 1 profile.
09:47:47 <sphinx[m]> stubbornant: So download it from f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid and report to them how having and out-of-date apk as the main download link is confusing for people using profiles.
09:49:36 <stubbornant[m]> <sphinx[m] "stubbornant: So download it from"> I will tell them, they also are awesome
09:53:45 <stubbornant[m]> 1.11 is not installing either
09:57:18 <sphinx[m]> stubbornant: Hmm did you tap the 'Download apk' rather than the blue button 'DOWNLOAD F-DROID'?
09:57:46 <stubbornant[m]> Yes
10:00:54 <stubbornant[m]> <sphinx[m] "stubbornant: Hmm did you tap the"> Nono my bad I downloaded the right version and it works
10:00:57 <stubbornant[m]> Thanks
10:32:20 <Thatcher[m]> What's the bluetooth timeout feature in the new update?
10:33:10 <dazinism> If nothing is connected bluetooth turns off
10:34:12 <Thatcher[m]> Awesome
10:35:32 <Thatcher[m]> Also, is the new camera/mic indicator from aosp or is that a Graphene exclusive?
10:37:11 <strcat[m]> AOSP
10:37:24 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: bluetooth thing isn't enabled by default, it's just an option
10:53:54 <Guest1072> hi, i installed grapheneos on my pixel 3a the other day and a newer version has been released since, but it hasn't updated automatically and when pressing "check for updates", nothing happens either
10:56:34 <billinmtl[m]> <Guest1072 "hi, i installed grapheneos on my"> I believe the latest release is still in beta - the stable version usually is a day or two later
10:58:42 <strcat[m]> Guest1072: https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
10:58:55 <strcat[m]> and look at the listing of the releases in the 2 public release channels
11:00:21 <Guest1072> thanks!
13:15:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <j​_a_m_e_z> I suppose a different way to ask might be: can merely the 5G protocol be disabled in the 5G phones?
13:18:27 <strcat[m]> yes
13:18:31 <strcat[m]> normal LTE mode setting
13:18:42 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode is to also disable 2G/3G (added by GrapheneOS)
13:20:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a​cegeorge> LTE is more safe than 2g/3g?
13:23:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> yes, see https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
13:32:34 <katapulsator> is it possible to use the internet connection of my laptop on the pixel 4 via cable?
14:11:43 <chocolatebarbrai> Does grapheneos prevent Bluetooth/WiFi tracking in retail stores, or does the Bluetooth/Wi-Fi radio need to be manually disabled?
14:13:54 <dazinism> chocolatebarbrain: system WiFi and bluetooth both act to preserve privacy.
14:14:30 <dazinism> I think theres possibly ways a store or even shopping center could track your route though
14:15:15 <dazinism> If they have many WiFi access points with the same ID
14:15:34 <dazinism> Shopping center / mall
14:16:17 <chocolatebarbrai> Even if I don't connect to their WiFi?
14:16:27 <dazinism> I'm not an expert on tha,  not totally sure how that would be handled if you don't connect and I way be getting confused.
14:16:38 <dazinism> *I may be
14:18:42 <dazinism> Certainly next time you came to the shop they wouldnt know.it was you
14:19:20 <dazinism> Guess the safest is turn off WiFi when you not using it
14:20:51 <chocolatebarbrai> OK thank you
14:23:12 <dazinism> Not sure of any details of bluetooth privacy. But know generally its ahead of WiFi.
14:24:36 <dazinism> chocolatebarbrain: saved this link, but bot sure I've read it
14:24:39 <dazinism> https://duo.com/decipher/understanding-bluetooth-security
14:25:52 <dazinism> With the latest release, which is rolling out now, theres an option to have bluetooth turns off automatically if you aren't actively using it
14:27:28 <dazinism> If I remember correctly Briar aren't sure about using bluetooth LE because of privacy concerns
14:29:59 <chocolatebarbrai> Honestly makes me nervous to even carry my bluetooth headphones into the store

15:18:52 <captainepoch> chocolatebarbrai: why?
15:35:35 <freedomofspeech> This post is to just advise grapheneos that since I was banned last week for expressing my freedom of speech while answering another friendly post about installing grapheneos by expressing my dislike for using another OS, being unjustly and viciously called a troll by a moderator, and then hiis banning me from your grapheneos node, that I have
15:35:35 <freedomofspeech> decided to abandon my efforts to install grapheneos, as well to abandon my plan to make a significant donation to the grapheneos project, should it have installed and worked properly.  Have a bad day!
15:38:11 <louipc> sorry to see you go. these chans are not really a place to express freedom of speech though.
15:40:21 <timetravelingman> <freedomofspeech "This post is to just advise grap"> You have freedom of speech in context of a government institution, not a Matrix/IRC channel for an operating system lmao
15:41:00 <freedomofspeech> It was a simple disagreement with someone's suggestion that I needed to update my PC to Windows 10 immediately.  Not a real political issue.
15:41:50 <timetravelingman> Okay, well no one said you have freedom of speech here like you do in context of the government
15:43:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Oh nvm, it was supposed to be on IRC side on banning

16:13:50 <strcat> once you have looked there, if you still have a question, ask that
16:14:25 <strcat> and please don't ask for estimates on when stuff will be implemented, the real question is when are you going to help with it, because it's an open source project
16:14:40 <somenerd[m]> Some sound sorta worrying (factory reset after some amount of time, for example)
16:26:32 <m2tu[m]> strcat: sorry i did missunderstood that, thought GrapheneOS-Teleg said those are goin to be mplented

17:25:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> m2tu: grapheneos-teleg is a bot

17:34:21 <strcat[m]> it does

18:44:26 <Jgem[m]> I went into admin user and to network but swear I can't find the way to change to LTE only on my pixel 5. It shouldn't be complicated  .. I read where to look further back in chat. I clicked on every possible thing in settings. ? ???

19:10:48 <pixel-rush[m]> Is there a trash location that I can recover images from?Just deleted an image that I need back
19:11:56 <strcat> pixel-rush[m]: not unless you deleted it in an app providing that
19:12:30 <pixel-rush[m]> no, just from the gallery
19:13:10 <strcat> so, basically, the MediaStore APIs have a trash API
19:13:16 <strcat> so apps can move to trash instead of deleting
19:13:20 <strcat> but most don't
19:14:03 <strcat> pixel-rush[m]: Gallery probably just deleted it, unless you edited it with it in which case I think it makes backups in a hidden .aux directory
19:15:06 <strcat> so, look for .aux with hidden files shown
19:15:11 <strcat> but it is probably gone
19:15:14 <pixel-rush[m]> Thanks. Just looking thru the file manager to see if there was a location they were dumped to
19:15:26 <strcat> the Gallery app just isn't very good
19:15:34 <strcat> a modern app would have move to trash
19:15:50 <strcat> pixel-rush[m]: they only added the official trash API in Android 11, previously apps had to do it themselves
19:16:06 <pixel-rush[m]> its more of a central viewing location
19:24:38 <M647509735485097> Its really a shame Vanadium doesn't feature an adblocker
19:31:57 <pizzaeater69[m]> It focuses on pure security
19:43:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> <M647509735485097 "Its really a shame Vanadium does"> An adblocker is a bit like anti-virus software: https://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/
19:49:57 <Oneover[m]> any way to get the phone/dialer in dark theme?
19:51:02 <M647509735485097> More of a convenience factor. Haven't watched an ad in like 5 years so was just a little surprised. Thankfully Bromite is recommended
20:03:23 <dazinism> Oneover: only way is to install an alternative dialler app
20:03:42 <dazinism> ... or you can invert colours for everything 😃
20:03:55 <Oneover[m]> Harsh
20:11:30 <interesting[m]> will seedvault backup work if I first backup it to the device (not cloud), and then save on thumb drive. later I will put it back on a device and restore. will that work?
20:19:04 <interesting[m]> the .SeedVaultAndroidBackup folder is only 154 kb, is that normal? where's the actual backup then? I have backed up a lot of apps with their data
20:20:48 <spiderlips[m]> I have a question. In the latest release there's a voice that says
20:20:48 <spiderlips[m]> "set GrapheneOS launcher as a default notification listener on fresh installs so that the default enabled notification integration is permitted by default like the stock OS (existing users still need to manually enable the permission for the built-in launcher)"
20:20:48 <spiderlips[m]> How is this possible? I can't find the setting under settings..
20:25:34 <strcat[m]> spiderlips: long press home screen, go to settings, and it'll guide you to the right place to enable the notification permission
20:26:42 <strcat[m]> alternatively, Settings -> Apps & notifications -> Special app access (in Advanced) -> Notification access -> select the app (that's where the Launcher settings menu sends you)
20:29:23 <spiderlips[m]> <strcat[m] "alternatively, Settings -> Apps "> Thanks!
21:04:36 <Jgem[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Jgem Settings > Network & intern"> I can go    Settings > network & internet > Mobile Network
21:05:45 <interesting[m]> I can't add nextcloud in the seedvault settings after choosing to save backups locally. "Account not available. Set up one (or disable passcode)"
21:05:48 <Jgem[m]> Either it has to do with verizon prepaid? Or what? It seemed like it was an option built into the OS so I should be able to change the preferred network type no matter how the phone is activated.
21:06:08 <interesting[m]> this option is greyed out, I can't do anything about it. I tried changing recovery code words, but it doesn't help
21:16:47 <princemachiavell> Jgem:  you can still configure it using the *#*#INFO#*#* menu.
21:19:30 <princemachiavell> Shoot, there are suppose to be * characters but I'm not sure how to escape them in element.
21:24:00 <Jgem[m]> <princemachiavell "Jgem:  you can still configure i"> Sorry not sure what you mean
21:24:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> *#*#
21:24:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> *#*#4636#*#*
21:25:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Disable markdown editing
21:25:50 <Jgem[m]> Okay.. I will give it a shot... Actually on hold right now on the phone so I will have to try that after this call
21:27:43 <Jgem[m]> Thank you..
21:27:44 <Jgem[m]>  Is it a grapheneos issue that the preferred network type option is not available in my Pixel 5??  Something worth filing an issue ?
21:28:04 <strcat[m]> not worth filing an issue
21:28:08 <strcat[m]> not a Pixel 5 issue
21:28:15 <princemachiavell> I think it may depend on which carrier you use.
21:28:15 <strcat[m]> it's carrier quirk
21:28:15 <Jgem[m]> <strcat[m] "not worth filing an issue"> Ok
21:28:34 <strcat[m]> carriers have different configuration available, it's determined by them for the standard configs
21:28:46 <Jgem[m]> Got it.. Thought it might be verizon.. See what is written here about them
21:28:46 <strcat[m]> but you can't just ignore it or stuff is broken
21:28:53 <strcat[m]> yes Verizon is terrible
21:29:45 <strcat[m]> and btw we're interested in feedback about whether the latest release has made tethering available / working for people who have nasty carriers wanting it disabled
21:30:06 <strcat[m]> some may have detection of tethered traffic via TTL but you can configure the laptop or whatever to have 1 higher TTL than usual to deal with that
21:30:21 <Jgem[m]> I learned post activation .. After some months learning about grapheneos I plan on getting a new pixel 5 to start over new imei etc knowing more how to use the phone and will get a new carrier next time..
21:30:34 <Jgem[m]> I will try to tether sometime today.
21:56:58 <M647509735485097> I am on Verizon and successfully tethered today (pre-update). Initially connected to the network via my iPad but was unable to get WiFi working. I disabled the hotspot, forgot the network on my iPad and tried again and used it all day without issue
21:57:29 <M647509735485097> I only say pre update cause I updated this very second but throughout work tethered all day
21:58:03 <strcat[m]> only need to know if the new update improves things for people who had issues + doesn't make things worse
22:07:35 <ffff> Are there any settings to change in order to get Bromite or Vanadium to get GPS working within the browser? I've already allowed GPS when the website asks for permission. I see GPS working fine in MagicEarth, but not those browsers.
22:10:03 <justawfulgamer[m> Speaking of GPS, can anyone get tts to work in osmand? According to osmand its a device issue, I already installed google tts but that hasn't seemed to work
22:26:45 <dazinism> justawfulgamer: think you probably need to enable TTS in the android accessibility settings
22:27:09 <dazinism> It is a bit of a dance to get TTS working in OSMand
22:27:56 <justawfulgamer[m> OK I'll look into it. Thanks!
22:28:40 <dazinism> I've got it working fine with RHVoice TTS app although that app appears to be randomly problematic to set up for a few people
22:32:27 <ffff> My GPS started working within Bromite after I updated to the March GrahineOS release. I can't see what exact version it is though on the `About phone` page. I also restarted my phone, and toggled the GPS on/off settings and retried and it works
22:35:34 <strcat[m]> dazinism: it works fine but people are confused by the UI in TTS settings
22:35:50 <strcat[m]> dazinism: since it shows it as selected (due to the way the UI working always showing one thing selected) when it isn't yet enabled
22:36:02 <strcat[m]> so they're confused by that and think it's set as the enabled TTS when it isn't
22:36:10 <strcat[m]> has to be pressed to enable it
22:38:42 <Malkmus> Would the seamless update client still check for and download updates if automatic system updates was off in developer options?
22:38:48 <strcat[m]> yes
22:38:54 <strcat[m]> that doesn't do anything
22:39:00 <strcat[m]> developer options are for developers
22:39:11 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
22:40:34 <Malkmus> Hypothetically if someone wanted to disable auto updates they would disable background data usage in the seamless client?
22:42:35 <strcat> no
22:42:44 <strcat> please read the information in the section I linked
22:43:45 <Jgem[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "*#*#4636#*#*"> When I enter this into dialer..as soon as I type in the last asterisk the digits vanish from dailer line and nothing happens.
22:44:01 <strcat> Jgem[m]: not doing it right
22:44:21 <strcat> or, perhaps Verizon disables it
22:44:32 <strcat> more likely a typo
22:44:49 <Jgem[m]> The astericks didn't show up in the copied reply I just used above but?
22:45:05 <strcat> princemachiavell: anupritaisno1[m]: Jgem[m]: please note the hidden carrier debug menu does NOT provide a way to configure actual LTE only mode
22:45:23 <Jgem[m]> Entered *#*#4636#*#*
22:45:28 <strcat> that's only a temporary toggle of the preferred mode which is not persistent and does not reduce attack surface since dropping network reverts it
22:45:34 <strcat> Jgem[m]: it doesn't let you do it anyway
22:45:48 <strcat> Jgem[m]: the info above was incorrect
22:46:07 <strcat> the debug menu only allows you to temporarily turn on a different mode in a way that doesn't reduce attack surface since it reverts if network drops
22:46:20 <strcat> it's not functionality that's available in AOSP / stock OS
22:46:28 <strcat> that menu doesn't provide it
22:46:31 <strcat> ppl are just wrong about it
22:46:44 <strcat> common misconception that it provides a working implementation of this
22:47:37 <Jgem[m]> Okay. So no LTE only on a pixel 5 when using Verizon at all it appears .. Got it. Thank you.
22:52:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Pablo (@t​hebiglez) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:09:28 <Jgem[m]> I tried to tether my Linux laptop to my Verizon pixel 5 and it didn't work. I'm not all that good with Linux but I searched online and found a command to change my TTL. I changed it and the tether worked.
23:09:28 <Jgem[m]> Though when the laptop connects to hotspot even though my VPN is always on on the phone the connection from laptop bypasses that.
23:09:28 <Jgem[m]> When I tried to start my VPN again on the laptop using the protonvpn-cli it says no internet connection found.
23:10:20 <Clutchward> How come Osmand maps always gives me a weird error that says it's downloading  but never does? I h ave my location downloaded and GPS works, satstat works, but not osmand
23:14:40 <faxing[m]> What are the "App Freezer" and "App Compaction" features that are listed in the newest Graphene update?
23:21:05 <strcat> Jgem[m]: phone VPN isn't supposed to apply to tethered device
23:21:22 <strcat> so that the tethered device isn't forced to use that VPN and can use another etc
23:21:29 <strcat> standard way it works on ANdroid
23:21:40 <strcat> faxing[m]: resource saving features for background apps
23:23:36 <Jgem[m]> <strcat "Jgem: phone VPN isn't supposed t"> Sorry I got that right away but would be nice if it did.
23:23:41 <faxing[m]> Ah so stuff to improve battery when background apps run?
23:24:40 <faxing[m]> I like the camera and mic indicators as well -- hard to see what app used them if it was just for a second since they disappear when they're no longer in use, but they'
23:24:44 <faxing[m]>  * I like the camera and mic indicators as well -- hard to see what app used them if it was just for a second since they disappear when they're no longer in use, but they're still awesome
23:31:37 <strcat> faxing[m]: app compaction reduces memory usage from GC heap, freezing reduces CPU usage for apps not meant to be running
23:32:00 <strcat> faxing[m]: only foreground apps with the permissions can use the camera, microphone or sensors
23:32:22 <strcat> there's no camera/microphone/sensors access by background apps in modern Android
23:33:06 <faxing[m]> alright
23:33:12 <faxing[m]> thank you very much for the information
23:33:37 <faxing[m]> <strcat "faxing: only foreground apps wit"> That's good to hear -- it was always a bit of a concern of mine
23:34:17 <strcat[m]> that's why it says 'allow while in use' for granting camera/microphone (we haven't made that change for our added Sensors permission yet)
23:34:42 <strcat[m]>  * that's why it says 'allow while in use' for granting camera/microphone (we haven't made that UI change for our added Sensors permission yet but it's already how sensors work for modern Android)
23:35:05 <klarkkable[m]> who's the contact point for joining the testing group/program? I noticed a few weeks back that you were looking for pixel 3a XL owners and finally got one from a friend
23:47:24 <Jgem[m]> Sorry if this is just not considered a priority but any idea on getting the issue fixed where SMS  notifications in secondary users do not make the notification sound..... ??
