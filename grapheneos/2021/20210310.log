00:06:17 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: you just aren't giving it enough time when in airplane mode
00:06:30 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: GNSS (GPS, etc.) just by themselves takes a LONG time
00:07:16 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: GPS works in airplane mode, it just takes way longer without having the ability to bootstrap it from the carrier
00:07:58 <strcat[m]> with no internet access at all it literally takes minutes to get a GPS lock with clear view on the sky in a field
00:08:12 <strcat[m]> internet access speeds it up since it gets to fetch supplementary data via internet connection
00:08:16 <strcat[m]> the app can trigger it to do that ASAP
00:08:38 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: being connected to a cellular network with working SUPL is what really speeds it up and makes it take 15-30s
00:08:43 <strcat[m]> (when outside)
00:08:57 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: none of that is really specific to GrapheneOS
00:09:31 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: you're just used to having Apple/Google services submitting nearby Wi-Fi networks, cell towers and Bluetooth devices to their servers and getting back a guess on your location from that
00:09:46 <strcat[m]> and then GPS kicks in to provide a more reliable location after some time (separate from that)
00:10:21 <strcat[m]> we don't have network-based location, we just have the standard A-GPS support (downloading supplementary GPS data from Qualcomm + using carrier-based SUPL)
00:11:33 <juanjulio[m]> Ok, thanks for confirming what I thought.  I think it's the location faker that's not playing nice. I've been in airplane mode with wifi on and literally after 10 minutes still no location.
00:11:47 <strcat[m]> are you outside?
00:11:48 <dannyknoll3[m]> anupritaisno1: PM sent!
00:12:53 <juanjulio[m]> Turning off location faker gets me a location in 30 seconds to 2 minutes. I'm indoors by a window
00:13:31 <juanjulio[m]> Are you aware of a location faker that works?
00:43:31 <jay46> In trying to get SMS notifications to make noise I went as far as to factory reset back to original graphene install and still no sound. I don't know what else to do. All I put in my admin user was a VPN app. Im in a second user and on fresh reset in second user zero sound for SMS notifications. I've checked every notification and sound setting and
00:43:31 <jay46> can't figure anything out.
00:57:51 <dannyknoll3[m]> <jay46 "can't figure anything out."> Seems so
00:58:06 <dannyknoll3[m]> Send screenshots of sound settings? May be overlooking something
00:58:29 <dannyknoll3[m]> Are notifications for SMS happening at all?
01:44:55 <jay46> Dannyknoll3: never use this kind of chat.. How do I send screenshots.. If you're still there
01:52:05 <strcat[m]> you can attach an image
01:52:06 <strcat[m]> or just link to one elsewhere
02:12:50 <jay46> strcat: On a totally fresh Grapheneos Factory reset, the Admin user will make a sound when an sms comes in, but in a second user, the notification will come up at the top and the phone will vibrate, but it will make no sound at all.
02:13:30 <jay46> No one else is having this issue ?
02:14:10 <jay46> I am following the grapheneos.org site recommendation on a more secure setup, and not using the admin user for anything but to host another user.
02:15:15 <jay46> A pretty big deal, needing to hear when I get a message.
02:19:46 <TheJollyRoger> jay46: nope, not having that issue unless I turn the notification volume way down or have it set to "vibrate only."
02:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> Oh for a second profile.
02:20:00 <TheJollyRoger> Let me check.
02:20:07 <jay46> ya second..  thanks for checking
02:21:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Is the primary user admin?
02:21:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Can multiple users have the same pass?
02:22:10 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - multiple users can have the same password. This *DOES NOT* affect the strength of the encryption, since profiles *DO NOT* share keys.
02:22:43 <jay46> Theres a whole part in the www.grapheneos.org FAQ section about the users and passwords .. It helped me to reread the FAQ twice and the second time really slow and carefully.. then I went on to reread every word on the website.. which also helped me..
02:22:44 <TheJollyRoger> jay46: I am seeing what you are seeing.
02:22:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Phew. That is a relief.
02:23:03 <jay46> @thejollyroger: AHHH!!! so its not just me!
02:23:41 <TheJollyRoger> jay46 - I'm a tad bit occupied right now, but you can file an issue on the issue tracker, or I can file it on your behalf.
02:23:45 <TheJollyRoger> When I get back later.
02:24:34 <jay46> its a good start to know its not me... I wasted a lot of time by trying a factory reset and wiping away all the time i put into the setup I spent a few days putting together after my install.. I will look for the way to file an issue on issue tracker right now
02:25:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Search to make sure there's not a duplicate, first.
02:25:28 <jay46> never done anything like that but going to site to figure it out..
02:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> jay46: be sure to include the exact process that you took, and the step-by-step process to reproduce, that will help immensely.
02:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> When filing a bug, what I like to do is list:
02:26:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I have heard somebody say we should always use secondary users for everything. Why would that be, I wonder.
02:26:47 <TheJollyRoger> "Expected behaviour" "Observed Behaviour" "Steps to reproduce bug"
02:26:58 <jay46> Hard to tell the exact issue category. OS Issue Tracker?
02:27:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, OS Issue Tracker.
02:27:11 <jay46> I will follow your advice .. got it.. thanks ...
02:27:30 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - it's not a matter of always, it's a matter of threat model, and  many people here like to say they have high threat models.
02:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - Some reasoning why people might do that include:
02:28:08 <TheJollyRoger> A) They want to keep apps that require or request more permissions/more access than they should separated from their primary contextual identity
02:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> B) They want to be able to render the data in that profile safe by putting it at rest when they do not require it to be in use by using "end session"
02:29:18 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles those are the reasons why.
02:29:36 <jay46> Isnt it also.  you can also delete that user, so that data from within that user is wiped and since it had been encrypted its a better wipe, then say just deleting an app from within your main/primary/admin user?
02:30:12 <TheJollyRoger> jay46: ah, yes, secure deletion. Yes, if you want to securely delete something without needing a factory reset, then yes, you can do that.
02:30:16 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, I forgot about that.
02:31:24 <jay46> that part is easiest for me to wrap my head around, because other people in here debated how separated the apps really are in separate profiles..  but the secure deletion seems agreed across board...
02:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. When a profile is deleted its keys are discarded.
02:32:21 <jay46> I get that. That is useful.
02:34:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I would normally use the closed-source or intrusive apps inside different users.Take Minecraft as an example. Closed source, little auditing experience, will use Wi-Fi? Better isolate in a different user.
02:34:57 <tiki> hello i am having trouble removing graphene OS
02:35:10 <tiki> i follow all the steps and at the end i erase the key and then it wont let me boot up
02:36:15 <strcat> tiki: sounds like you're just installing GrapheneOS again
02:36:21 <strcat> tiki: you have to go install the stock OS
02:36:26 <strcat> and erase the GrapheneOS key
02:37:08 <HowardR> Building grapheneos with sdk_phone_x86_64 worked great, thanks!!
02:38:30 <HowardR> I'm thinking the next step toward contributing free programming would be to set up some kind of debugging environment. Is there a guide for that? If not how might I do that?
02:38:30 <tiki> where do i find the stock OS?
02:39:03 <tiki> i guess im just confused because it says the process is the exact same until the end where u erase the custom key
02:39:34 <strcat> tiki: the exact same, but with the stock OS
02:39:38 <strcat> you don't have the stock OS anymore
02:39:40 <strcat> you have GrapheneOS
02:39:40 <akc3n[m]> <tiki "where do i find the stock OS?"> https://developers.google.com/android/images
02:40:41 <tiki> thank you i will try this
02:41:59 <jay46> strcat: Did you see the above discussion with thejollyroger that he also has the same issue, secondary users will not make a notification sound for new sms messages
02:44:20 <strcat[m]> yes, I saw, probably an AOSP Messaging app issue
02:44:46 <jay46> I am filing a issue. Ive never done that before but I am trying to write it clear and concise.
02:51:20 <jay46> @thejollyroger: I posted the issue. Think I wrote it up clearly.
02:52:08 <akc3n[m]> <jay46 "I am filing a issue. Ive never d"> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sms
02:52:53 <akc3n[m]> * https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sms
02:52:54 <akc3n[m]> Some examples... Perhaps...?
02:55:15 <tiki> got it to work. THANKS EVERYONE :)
02:56:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Such FLOSS programs as F-Droid, NewPipe, Telegram, IMO should go on the primary account, for me.
02:56:32 <jay46> akc3n: I think I wrote it pretty clearly. Its up now..
02:56:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Sorry, programs ONLY from F-Droid and no antifeatures.
02:58:46 <TheJollyRoger> jay46: awesome, I see it now! Looks good.
02:58:59 <jay46> thanks
03:00:02 <jay46> Glad you recommended I do it, so I could familiarize myself with the process/looking there for any issues first
03:00:22 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome!
03:07:39 <timetravelingman> Half the time when I get an SMS in a secondary profile, the message doesn't show up in the app and I'll only get a notification for it
03:08:07 <timetravelingman> Well, like 20% of the time probably
03:09:56 <timetravelingman> I don't really care though because if I'm getting an SMS it's probably from someone I don't feel the need to urgently respond to
03:11:55 <jay46> I get all the messages instantly like its supposed to work, and notifications show at top of screen and vibrate, just no chiming sound..
03:12:49 <jay46> gotta roll guys.. gnite
03:26:51 <bizanon[m]> <strcat[m] "don't want to change the default"> Thanks for the reply. What do you mean by opt-in?
03:28:20 <strcat[m]> bizanon: why not run a VPN on the clients?
03:28:28 <strcat[m]> and then you aren't forced to correlate them together
03:28:49 <bizanon[m]> I haven't tried that yet. Thanks for suggestion
03:59:01 <peter98> hi guys
03:59:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
03:59:16 <peter98> having a hell of a time installing graphene on my pixel 4a
03:59:27 <TheJollyRoger> What be yore problem, matey?
04:00:00 <peter98> alright I tried to flash all and it says waiting for device, i'm stuck there
04:00:08 <peter98> I unlocked fastboot as well
04:00:36 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I'm going to ask you a couple questions which might help narrow things down a bit...
04:00:39 <TheJollyRoger> But I think I know what it is.
04:00:45 <peter98> much apreciated
04:00:49 <TheJollyRoger> First question: have you tried the web installer?
04:01:03 <peter98> well it should work but its not finding the device
04:01:18 <peter98> I trid factory rom via the google web page and it was working just fine
04:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, second question, if you type in "fastboot --version" what does it return to you?
04:02:13 <TheJollyRoger> Third question, if you type in "fastboot devices" does it return your device serial number? (Don't tell it to me, that information is for you and you alone to know)
04:02:16 <peter98> sec
04:02:55 <peter98> fastboot version 31.0.0-7110759
04:03:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, good, and with the phone plugged in, and on the fastboot screen, does "fastboot devices" return your device serial number?
04:03:39 <peter98> fastvoot devices turns nothing
04:03:44 <peter98> adb devices retrns the device
04:03:48 <peter98> boot*
04:04:09 <TheJollyRoger> Quick sanity check: when you run fastboot devices, the phone is on the fastboot black screen saying "unlocked", correct?
04:04:21 <peter98> its not
04:04:23 <peter98> i can get there
04:04:24 <peter98> sec
04:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, set the phone to fastboot. Hold down the volume key and the power key at the same time once the phone is off.
04:04:52 <peter98> ok now it shows
04:05:01 <peter98> platform-tools>fastboot devices
04:05:02 <peter98> 06191JEC200085  fastboot
04:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Now try running ./flash-all
04:05:10 <strcat[m]> peter98: you need to follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
04:05:15 <strcat[m]> you're having problems because you aren't doing that
04:05:41 <strcat[m]> peter98: it looks like you're following one of the inaccurate/misguided third party guides
04:05:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It needs to be on fastboot, in order for anything fastboot to work.
04:05:57 <strcat[m]> peter98: I strongly recommend stopping that, closing it, undoing what it had you do and following one of the official methods
04:06:09 <strcat[m]> you're only going to waste more time and potentially screw up your computer and the phone with unofficial guides
04:06:30 <peter98> thats the problem was following youtube videos
04:06:34 <strcat[m]> yes
04:06:35 <strcat[m]> so stop that
04:06:36 <strcat[m]> close it
04:06:39 <peter98> i'm using the web page, lets see
04:06:39 <strcat[m]> clear away what you downloaded
04:06:43 <strcat[m]> follow one of the official methods
04:06:49 <strcat[m]> either web installer or our official CLI guide
04:06:54 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, you were following the youtube videos? Yeah, that'll end you up with a potentially unbootable device.
04:06:56 <strcat[m]> third party guides are largely wrong / dangerous
04:08:31 <peter98> seems to be working
04:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> Fastboot talks to the bootloader, when the phone is on the bootloader, before the operating system is running. ADB talks to Android, while the operating system is running, after the bootloader has loaded the operating system.
04:09:38 <TheJollyRoger> peter98: yarr, welcome aboard.
04:12:47 <peter98> wicked
04:13:07 <TheJollyRoger> peter98: don't forget, you *must* lock the bootloader to finish the installation.
04:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise the installation's not finished.
04:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure you see a yellow "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen when the phone turns back on.
04:13:37 <peter98> so that was a breeze but your website could really improve on the UI/UX side of things. I'm a ui guy if you ever need a hand. there was a few pain point areas where you get a lot of people dropping off and being even more confused
04:13:38 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Fastboot talks to the bootloader"> Good clarification
04:13:49 <peter98> thanks for all the hard work folks, looking forward to the revolution :)
04:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> peter98: yarr, that be good to know!
04:14:18 <TheJollyRoger> peter98: welcome aboard the ship, make sure the bootloader's locked,
04:14:26 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: arr, I got a bit confused with the difference too.
04:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> peter98: After you see the yellow screen, you can skip it by tapping the power button twice and letting it go quickly, but make sure you do see it. If you get an orange "Software integrity is not guaranteed" warning, the installation's not done and you'll need to go back and finish that step to finish the installation.
04:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Locking the bootloader is required for all security features dependent on the verified boot to function, including the hardware-backed keying and attestation.
04:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> While the bootloader is unlocked, all those security features are switched off. You can reenable developer options, switch OEM unlocking off, and then switch developer options back off once again to help to make sure that if someone wants to unlock your bootloader again, they'll have to issue a factory reset from recovery to get at that switch a second time.
04:20:45 <TheJollyRoger> This offers a little bit of extra protection, just in case.
04:35:15 <KanYe[m]> Hello everyone — how will the model number G013A will fare with the grapheneOs installation.
04:35:15 <KanYe[m]> It’s a used Pixel 3 with 128GB of storage, and according to the specs sheet, it’s a GSM only phone, no CDMA version.
04:35:15 <KanYe[m]> I want to be able to use Mint Mobile with it, which does use the T Mobile Network which I’m currently under. Can it work, and if so can I install Graphene OS and have it be working ?
04:37:44 * entry1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KmnwDVScrhYxMrPapVcstXCl/message.txt >
04:38:44 <entry1[m]> Certain GSM models can be unlocked, but not all of them.
04:38:51 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Be aware that the pixel 3 is an older device too, and that it is closer than the other supported devices to being at the end off its supported lifetime
04:39:33 <entry1[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "Be aware that the pixel 3 is an "> Yep May 2022
04:41:07 <mr_hebi_san[m]> If you don't already own the device, it's good to know how long is left on its support window before you decide on a good price.
04:41:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
04:41:47 <KanYe[m]> Dang. So that means that the Pixel 4, 4a and 5 is pretty much my option right now for future proofing ?
04:43:42 <entry1[m]> <KanYe[m] "Dang. So that means that the Pix"> 4a and 5 get almost an additional year of updates more than the 4.
04:44:22 <TheJollyRoger> KanYe[m]: yes. The Pixel 3 will be EOL in a few months.
04:44:48 <TheJollyRoger> KanYe[m]: Don't buy it.
04:45:33 <KanYe[m]> Alright I won’t. I’ll try to save up for the Pixel 4a then. Thanks for the help and I’ll contact you guy again once I can get it on my hand
04:45:50 <TheJollyRoger> KanYe[m]: generally what happens is toward the end of a device's life (generally after the phone is de-listed from the Google Store), the retailers will flood the market with bootloader locked devices in an effort to get rid of the stock they have, before it becomes worthless, flooding the market with locked devices, many of which will have lost their original packaging, or be mixed in without
04:45:52 <TheJollyRoger> regard to whether or not they are unlockable or not.
04:45:56 <TheJollyRoger> Often the sellers will not know the difference themselves.
04:46:33 <TheJollyRoger> As a result, chances are if you buy a Pixel 3 or 3a this late in the game, you're extremely likely to be ripped off.
04:46:53 <strcat[m]> they get the bootloader/carrier locked ones at a discount which is why they want to buy and reseller as unlocked
04:49:17 <TheJollyRoger> KanYe[m]: generally we encourage people to buy their own devices direct from Google Store, and click "unlocked device" at checkout. This is the safest way unless you can physically travel to the store equipped with a laptop and they let you plug it in, open the debugging menu and get the read-only boot property for the carrier ID.
04:52:07 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: need you to test something
04:52:16 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: yeah what can I do for you?
04:53:21 <strcat[m]> first can you install RHVoice and set it up (set up English then go enable it by pressing on it in the configuration menu and accepting dialog)
04:53:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir!
04:54:59 <TheJollyRoger> Just a moment.
04:56:12 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: do you want me to do a screen recording?
04:56:20 <strcat> no
04:56:26 <strcat> I know RHVoice works
04:56:31 <strcat> just set it up as a prerequisite
04:56:42 <strcat> and make sure TTS works for you
04:57:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, one moment. Downloading "Alan"
04:57:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I'm getting "If you can hear this message, then the voice is installed and working"
04:59:25 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: okay now enable it in the OS accessibility (or language) settings
04:59:29 <TheJollyRoger> Roger.
04:59:42 <strcat> you need to press the radio button for it (it misleadingly shows it as already selected)
05:00:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. I hit "OK" to the "This speech synthesis engine may be able to collect all the text data that will be spoken etc etc..."
05:00:53 <TheJollyRoger> Language is set to "Use system language."
05:01:06 <TheJollyRoger> When I hit "play" it replies "This is an example of speech synthesis in English."
05:01:57 <TheJollyRoger> What next?
05:02:20 <TheJollyRoger> Should I try seeing if I can get it to read a PDF or something...?
05:09:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, don't see Select To Speak under Accessibility.
05:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> I'll keep the app on. Let me know what else I should do.
05:19:21 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: you did the right setup now
05:19:25 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: wait a sec
05:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> Aye sir.
05:20:50 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: which device are you on again?
05:21:27 <TheJollyRoger> Just flame, last one.
05:22:12 <TheJollyRoger> Going to take a quick backup.
05:25:59 <TheJollyRoger> Just taking a quick backup right now.
05:30:45 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: pm
06:21:43 <snikita[m]> is there a way to add emojis to the grapheneos keyboard?
06:25:44 <strcat> not without modifying the sources but you can use a different keyboard
06:25:47 <snikita[m]> haha oh im dumb i figured it out. gotta slide on the "send" button
06:26:13 <snikita[m]> its there i just didnt know how to use it at first, sorry
06:26:49 <strcat> snikita[m]: it depends on the app
06:26:53 <strcat> the keyboard has different modes
06:26:57 <strcat> I thought you meant adding new emojis
06:27:08 <strcat> since it doesn't have all the fancy newer generations of them
06:27:15 <strcat> or the stuff like modifying their skin tone and gender
06:28:00 <snikita[m]> ah yeah sorry i wasnt clear. yeah im coming from ios so some things im not sure if its an android thing, or specifically a grapheneos thing, still getting used to it
06:32:18 <jay46> Can anyone recommend an app I use for chatting in forum like this. I've just come to it as webchat thru grapheneos website. I think I'd rather have an app setup so I can go back and read things.
06:33:00 <jay46> Instead of just picking app curious what people here like
06:43:33 <kamesjitt616[m]> You can join through matrix

08:51:17 <rain_cloud[m]> I don't have a pixel with graphene on it yet, but the next phone I get will def be that
09:12:17 <pizzaeater69[m]> We love to hear that:)
09:18:59 <gobananas> hello, somebody knows if fingerprint scanner supported in graphene?
09:22:06 <dannyknoll3[m]> gobananas: yes.
09:22:16 <dannyknoll3[m]> For system auth
09:22:45 <dannyknoll3[m]> Not for Google Pay etc that depends on Google Services
09:29:00 <gobananas> dannyknoll3: ok thanks
09:29:45 <gobananas> also, i saw when launching an app on graphene it takes like half a second to react, is it still a thing?
09:29:54 <gobananas> at least on pixel 4a 5G?
09:35:03 <nscnt[m]> gobananas:  You only experience the GrapheneOS exec-based spawning security feature when cold-starting an app. It's not noticeable on devices other than the old budget Pixel 3a.
09:36:31 <Preload[m]> .
09:36:54 <gobananas> nscnt: i understand
09:37:26 <gobananas> but i dont get one thing, if grapheneos has like hardened sandbox and so on, why google is not implementing that in their android?
09:38:04 <gobananas> i mean, if there is security issues with the standard android, then google probably already knows about that
09:39:19 <nscnt[m]> gobananas: It's not without drawbacks. Google has to serve a much larger user space. Thus, more politics are involved.
09:39:55 <nscnt[m]> gobananas: Google fixes security issues. It's not an issue per se. It's just not as hardened as it could be.
09:40:05 <nscnt[m]> GrapheneOS does that
09:40:15 <nscnt[m]> If you want that, you can get it
09:43:40 <pizzaeater69[m]> Btw is there documentation on how is the sandobx hardened? Features page just says it is but doesnt say how
09:44:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Martin (@m​aruide) has joined the Telegram Group!
10:02:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <pizzaeater69[m] "Btw is there documentation on ho"> Check out sepolicy repo (on Mandatory Access Control part of sandboxing improvements iirc)
10:07:12 <pizzaeater69[m]> Thank you

11:07:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> We don't need join/leave messages anyway it only clutters the chat
11:12:33 <pizzaeater69[m]> Could GrapheneOS website also have onion site
11:14:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's unnecessary
11:14:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just visit grapheneos.org over tor
11:16:34 <pizzaeater69[m]> Right
11:21:03 <alex-resist> Why is it unnecessary? Onion addresses are self-authenticating. If Let's Encrypt ever goes bust or there are other major issues, an onion service would still allow to use the website securely.
11:53:14 <M3manu31[m]> Is there a way to enable both fingerprint and pattern?
11:56:48 <nscnt[m]> 3manu31: Yes. Pattern is a primary authentication while fingerprint, as a biometric, is a secondary authentication.
12:00:02 <M3manu31[m]> Yea, I see but a want a 2FA. i. e. Unlock device only with fingerprint and pattern
12:01:06 <M3manu31[m]> * Yea, I see but I want a 2FA. i. e. Unlock device only with fingerprint and pattern
12:06:21 <nscnt[m]> 3manu31: No, that's not possible

12:07:09 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Nope
12:07:12 <came2complain[m]> and duress password
12:07:38 <came2complain[m]> I disabled pattern though because PIN/PW is more secure
12:07:39 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Nvm, maybe?
12:07:39 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not recommended, password + fingerprint as weaker is better
12:07:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> * Nvm, maybe?

14:32:03 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Once the SoC vendor stops providing security patches, no OS can make that phone secure against firmware exploits, and it'll be unpatchable

16:04:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Are carrier-locked phones permanently bootloader-locked?
16:06:49 <mynacol[m]> That's highly carrier dependent. To be safe, you should not buy a bootloader locked phone in the first place.
16:13:07 <nscnt[m]> *carrier-locked
16:13:28 <dannyknoll3Danny> <came2complain[m] "will contain the stuff that nobo"> That's a bold claim.
16:13:40 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles That's going to depend on who your carrier is, but generally the customer support staff won't know the difference between carrier and bootloader locked, so it's best to simply buy your phone direct from the Google store unless you can visit the retailer in person, plug your laptop in, switch on USB debugging, and obtain the read only properties of the phone to see for yourself.
16:16:36 <dannyknoll3Danny> came2complain: Why combative? If you're committed, could be some beautiful cooperation, here
16:19:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Then I should get a unlocked (carrier) phone.I imagine bootloader unlock prevention only works with carrier-locked then.Though it also depends on the manufacturer — off-topic, I discovered an update my Samsung made because of it bugging me to update just deleted the option to unlock the bootloader. Figures.
16:20:36 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - you should buy a new, unlocked device directly from the Google Store, that's the only way to be sure. Most retailers will think "oh it's carrier unlocked, therefore it's bootloader unlocked" but this is incorrect because it's possible for phones to be carrier unlocked, while still being bootloader locked.
16:21:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Uh-oh.
16:22:02 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - most of the time the guys being paid seven bucks an hour to sling those phones at retail will not know the difference and won't care anyways.
16:23:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Does that depend on model number?
16:23:46 <TheJollyRoger> No, not really.
16:24:18 <TheJollyRoger> Like I said, if you aren't willing to take the risk that you could be ripped off, have to return it and pay a restocking fee, buy direct from the Google Store.
16:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> *or have to return it and pay a restocking fee
16:25:09 <TheJollyRoger> The model numbers don't tell you if it's bootloader unlocked or not.
16:25:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Phew. My dad is going to get pissed off if I tell him it should be bootloader-unlocked.Probably will have to explain to him that unlocking the bootloader does not void warranty.
16:26:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Does it appear on the G Pixel 4a 5G manual or something?
16:26:18 <TheJollyRoger> As far as I know, there isn't official documentation on which SKU numbers are and aren't unlockable. You might find reports and reviews from other users on the internet, use that information at your own risk because it's submitted by people you will never know.
16:27:03 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles simply revert to stock and that warning goes away.
16:29:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> No, we have not got it yet.Though I have heard of a certain warning when you change OS. That is apparently normal.I want to show my dad the source in which Google claims that unlocking the bootloader does not void warranty. That will definitely give him peace of mind.
16:32:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Got it but not really. It is a journal article.

17:19:54 <HelpPixel4> Hello there
17:20:04 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: Play services are not planned on GrapheneOS, what's being *discussed* at this moment is a stub implementation which will return an error code to tell the app Google is offline.
17:20:06 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy HelpPixel4
17:20:20 <HelpPixel4> I tried to find help for this but I couldnt come in all the time
17:20:25 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: Right now, help is wanted there.
17:20:32 <TheJollyRoger> HelpPixel4: yes, what's up?
17:20:42 <HelpPixel4> I am trying to flash graphene OS on the pixel from tails (debuntu)
17:20:47 <HelpPixel4> But its giving me alot of problems
17:20:54 <HelpPixel4> I came so far to unlock the boot loader
17:21:11 <HelpPixel4> But I am stuck with flashing it to the phone
17:21:18 <TheJollyRoger> HelpPixel4: you'll want to use one of the supported operating systems, TAILS is not one of them.
17:21:31 <HelpPixel4> Its debuntu based
17:21:39 <HelpPixel4> So it not possible at all you say?
17:22:00 <HelpPixel4> Cause I had problems unlocking the boot loader but i coul figure this out
17:22:10 <TheJollyRoger> It might be, but if you're having trouble we don't want you to end up with a $500 paperweight.
17:22:28 <HelpPixel4> Why can that be?
17:22:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not standing over your shoulder, so I can't see what you're doing or what your setup is.
17:22:39 <HelpPixel4> Thats true
17:23:21 <TheJollyRoger> This abundance of caution is because you're dealing with a device that could cost you a lot of money to replace, and unofficial guides, unofficial instructions, workarounds, or third-party ways of doing that can result in that outcome.
17:23:43 <TheJollyRoger> Even though some people may have found ways to get them to work, or made them work in hinky, roundabout ways.
17:24:19 <HelpPixel4> Yes ofcourse I understand what you mean, I didnt realise it wasnt possible a the system is debian based
17:24:27 <TheJollyRoger> Since TAILS is purported to live entirely in memory, you may encounter problems with not enough space or the operating system aggressively cleaning out cache.
17:25:01 <TheJollyRoger> Worst case scenario, the system clears cache while flashing boot.img, and you end up with a permanent brick.
17:25:06 <TheJollyRoger> Pack it up and buy a new phone.
17:25:37 <HelpPixel4> Thats why..  Thats now what we want, I hope I didnt damage it yet then now with unlocking the boot loader
17:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> Odds of that happening are relatively small but it's abundance of caution why.
17:25:55 <HelpPixel4> Thanks for your help wil just go for windows then
17:25:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​ackintosh5WasTaken> flashing boot.img would never cause a permanent brick unless the corruption caused hardware problems or somehow erased the bootloader
17:26:04 <TheJollyRoger> So please just use the official web installer.
17:26:07 <HelpPixel4> Yes Ofcourse
17:26:12 <HelpPixel4> Thanks
17:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> If you have problems with the webinstaller, I or one of the others will be around!
17:26:30 <HelpPixel4> Thanks, bye
17:26:47 <devnull[m]> <HelpPixel4 "Thanks for your help wil just go"> good luck installing windows on a phone lol
18:04:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> You can not install Windows on an Android-powered phone.
18:05:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Oops, sorry. Meant to reply devnull.
18:21:17 <devnull[m]> that was sarcasm
18:31:14 <m2tu[m]> can anyone help me with this problem
18:31:15 <m2tu[m]> error: .repo/repo/: contains uncommitted changes
18:41:19 <sjsndnjdejd> you modify some files in that repo
18:42:10 <sjsndnjdejd> You can use git reset to revert
18:42:18 <sjsndnjdejd> * you modified some files in that repo
18:53:16 <m2tu[m]> i did reset it helped
18:53:20 <m2tu[m]> but when i do git satus
18:53:32 <m2tu[m]> i see lots of red folders
18:53:46 <m2tu[m]> shall i do git add folder name for all ?
18:54:13 <m2tu[m]> or are there other way to get hard reset on thoose
18:56:58 <Robert65> has anyone had the issue of when flashing your phone you get the error of transfer error?
18:58:52 <m2tu[m]> can u show more logs , and whe does it happen?
18:59:37 <Robert65> I'm using the web install tool and all i get is error: transfer failed after it goes to the fastboot screen
19:12:49 <borges[m]> m2tu: delete all those red folders, or clone another local repo from that repo and it should be clean
19:20:26 <borges[m]> Anyone know what tag or commit hash GOS 210305 is using for seedvault? I see in app info its version 11-1.0, but I'm looking at a stacktrace from seedvault and line numbers aren't matching up for master, 1.0.0 tag, or android 11 branch.
19:30:31 <Gui_Do> hi guys, are graphene developers using windows or linux machines?
19:35:33 <TheJollyRoger> Gui_Do: building GrapheneOS on Windows and MacOS is not supported. Building GrapheneOS on Linux is.
19:35:53 <TheJollyRoger> Gui_Do: as for what they do for personal use, that's up to them.
19:38:06 <Gui_Do> i ask because there are some hints in this channel that some linux disties are not supportet, but in my experience nearly all distros are able to install graphene
19:39:30 <Gui_Do> i did it on arch/manjaro, opensuse, debian...it ever worked
19:40:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> Not supported for what?
19:40:43 <Gui_Do> for installing graphene
19:42:35 * hypokeimenon[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/jzDHNHNfgnXiugetfmqUkSjj/message.txt >
19:43:21 <flawedworld[m]> <Gui_Do "i ask because there are some hin"> Theres a difference between support and it working on it. I have built and installed the OS on Fedora for example. Other distros are going to get support at best on a 'best effort' basis if you have problems.
19:43:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's a question of workload. Nothing stops you from doing it on other platforms if you know what you're doing.
19:44:58 <Gui_Do> thx for answer
19:45:06 <Gui_Do> got it

22:46:23 <strcat[m]> Forbo: try plugging in the phone again
22:46:51 <strcat[m]> maybe you don't have proper sessions so the udev rules aren't working
22:46:54 <strcat[m]> on your computer
22:53:31 <ManwithArrow[m]> Hi. This may be a dumb question, but is there a way to forcefully trigger IMS provisioning? Or force IMS-related toggles to appear in system settings?
22:55:23 <ManwithArrow[m]> Forbo: you could try installing via terminal. I found the WebUSB installer to be hit or miss.
22:56:36 <Forbo[m]> Tried unplugging and re-plugging, relaunched browser, same result. I'm going to see if I can dig in to the udev rules. It's showing up in lsusb so that's good. Thanks for the nudge strcat. Much appreciated. Man with Arrow I might give that a run if this ends up not leading anywhere. Thanks!
22:57:04 <ManwithArrow[m]> @forbo:matrix.org No problem. The terminal install isn't complex at all :-)
22:57:50 <strcat[m]> Forbo: it sounds like the udev rules aren't working for you
22:58:00 <strcat[m]> Forbo: don't know how that could happen
22:58:21 <strcat[m]> Man with Arrow: the web installer works as well as CLI, that advice really won't help
22:58:28 <strcat[m]> Man with Arrow: they'll have the same issue there
22:59:04 <strcat[m]> if the browser doesn't have permission to use it, neither would CLI tools running with the same privilege level
22:59:12 <Forbo[m]> Would an `apt purge android-sdk-platform-tools-common && apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common` be a good first step?
22:59:43 <ManwithArrow[m]> <strcat[m] "if the browser doesn't have perm"> Could be. Maybe I had my permissions configured differently. Maybe a login-logout / reboot would force reloading udev rules and make it work?
23:00:57 <Forbo[m]> Tried a reboot before. I just purged and reinstalled, I'm going to reboot again and see if that makes a difference.
23:01:09 <strcat[m]> Forbo: I don't think that would help, I think your sessions in your OS are messed up
23:01:13 <strcat[m]> it's an OS problem
23:01:16 <strcat[m]> it will impact CLI install too
23:01:33 <strcat[m]> Forbo: how did you install Chromium?
23:01:54 <Forbo[m]> If I remember rightly, `apt install chromium-browser`.
23:05:24 <Forbo[m]> But apparently it's a redirect to a snap now? Joy.
23:06:20 * Forbo[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/WejCEFZegYLBeeSkxrfeKEKO/message.txt >
23:06:46 <strcat[m]> Forbo: probably snap is broken
23:06:57 <strcat[m]>  * Forbo: perhaps snap is broken
23:07:14 <Forbo[m]> As in snapd or the Chromium snap?
23:07:25 <strcat[m]> I doubt snap has any way to delegate permission to read USB devices so they probably either have to allow it or not
23:07:28 <strcat[m]> and I guess they didn't allow it
23:07:45 <strcat[m]> it's not like Android where there's an actual working permission system and the OS prompts you if you want to let Vanadium etc. access USB
23:08:24 <Forbo[m]> Alright, so in this instance going the CLI route might be better if I'm understanding correctly.
23:09:51 <strcat[m]> if they don't offer a working Chromium-based browser
23:09:56 <strcat[m]> you could just use Chrome
23:10:25 <strcat[m]> Linux distributions often have broken packages, Ubuntu has broken fastboot, etc. packages inherited from Debian
23:10:39 <strcat[m]> they use their own homegrown broken build system and some ancient development snapshot release of fastboot
23:10:51 <strcat[m]> doesn't surprise me if they have a broken Chromium snap now
23:11:13 <strcat[m]> we can start recommending against using Ubuntu's Chromium package if it's the problem
23:12:49 <sjsndnjdejd> should just recommend against deb distros altogether
23:13:06 <rny> should just recommend against linux in general
23:13:26 <sjsndnjdejd> <rny "should just recommend against li"> Nah arch is fine
23:13:27 <Forbo[m]> Looks like doing it with Google Chrome worked. Thanks. Bootloader unlocked. Sorry for the inconvenience, much appreciated. I'll be kicking some moneroj your way once I've got this all done and running. Thanks again!
23:28:19 <ManwithArrow[m]> <ManwithArrow[m] "Hi. This may be a dumb question,"> Asking becuase my carrier has a very limited list of devices it provisions for IMS (pretty much just iPhones and Samsung flagships).

23:49:10 <visla[m]> My Pixel just arrived and I'm about to start setup
23:49:30 <visla[m]> I'm quite excited
23:49:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Dominik> Funny, I just had with the same problem, ubuntu chromium, now with chrome it works
