00:06:35 <lazy_pr1est[m]> I need help troubleshooting my phone's constant crashes. Where do I need to go/post to start this process?
00:06:41 <matt80> I skipped it. Installation was successful!
00:06:57 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: Fantastic! Glad to hear!
00:07:25 <TheJollyRoger> Once the operating system's booting and locked, you can go into developer mode and switch OEM unlocking to "off" if you prefer.
00:07:26 <matt80> I don't have a sim card in the phone yet so will just play around with it for now.
00:07:31 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
00:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> lazy_pr1est[m]: Likely the first thing to do is to check that it's not hardware. Each instance of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical across all installations on a given device, so first wait around here and see if anyone else complains of similar.
00:10:11 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: If you've got a reliable WiFi connection, you can try pairing with auditor at https://attestation.app/tutorial , using the project's own attestation server for integrity monitoring.
00:10:43 <TheJollyRoger> Once it's paired the first time the attestation server will pin your phone's keys. If they ever change or the phone fails to check in, it should dispatch an alert to you after a day and a half.
00:11:30 <matt80> ok, I'll do that.
00:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's really handy, if your phone doesn't check in or checks in wrong, you'll have a way of telling if something's wrong.
00:18:41 <matt80> that seemed to work ok.¬† So, the question now is installing apps. Would like to start with Signal and an email client.
00:19:03 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
00:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> With an E-mail client, I actually like FairEmail because it's updated very frequently, almost every single day.
00:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> The best place to get it at is from Github. The F-Droid version isn't updated nearly as often and lags behind significantly.
00:20:59 <TheJollyRoger> Signal has a signed and verified self-updating release at https://signal.org/android/apk . If you do install Aurora Store, you should blacklist Signal because Aurora will update Signal with the Play Store version, which while compatible, will not self-update (They're signed by the same certificate though so they're both genuine)
00:21:42 <TheJollyRoger> I used to like K-9 Mail because it was simpler but Fairemail is kept more up to date.
00:22:06 <TheJollyRoger> Note that if you download them via vanadium, you will need to add Vanadium to the whitelist.
00:22:16 <matt80> So, github has the .apk ?
00:22:18 <TheJollyRoger> By default, GrapheneOS does not add any apps to the whitelist to sideload.
00:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Let me go and retrieve it for you...
00:22:57 <matt80> I'm still on my laptop...
00:23:20 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/releases will have the APKs. You'll want to bookmark this page and return to it frequently.
00:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, if you're on your laptop then you can save the .apks to the laptop and install them later.
00:25:03 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: At the moment the Calendar app in Graphene is a stub, it's there because some Android APIs need it there, but its functionality has been disabled for the moment, so you might have to find a calendar app to replace it.
00:25:13 <matt80> I need to poke around and get familiar with moving files back and forth.
00:25:29 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. GrapheneOS supports Media Transfer Protocol, Windows 10 should as well.
00:26:13 <matt80> I don't tend to use a Calendar anyway so should be fine for the time being.
00:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: are you coming from an iPhone background, or have you used Android in the past?
00:27:24 <matt80> Had Android for many years...wife convinced me to try the iPhone about a year ago but all things considered am more comfortable with Android
00:27:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, got it!
00:28:29 <matt80> It's funny...for the life of me I can;t remember what I used as an email client on my previous androids.
00:28:45 <TheJollyRoger> A lot of things have changed since a year ago, now scoped storage is enforced, so apps compiled for a modern version of the Android API can't simply go willy-nilly with the storage permission.
00:28:46 <matt80> I tend to be a Thunderbird guy
00:28:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, I use Thunderbird too!
00:30:08 <matt80> I'm still draggin around my old Samsung S5 as a burner phone. Old Old version of Android.¬† Lot's of things will not run on it
00:30:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:31:25 <matt80> I'll need to connect to my ProtonMail account.
00:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. The Protonmail app take note, it *is* GSF Dependent but it will *run* without it. Just, anecdotally some members here who also use Protonmail have noted that without GSF, the Protonmail app will not display notifications for new messages until you open the app.
00:32:40 <TheJollyRoger> Since there's no GPlay to tell the app "Wake up, you have new messages."
00:33:38 <matt80> Good to know.
00:34:26 <matt80> Actually, that is one of the things I really dislike about my iPhone.¬† It is the same way.
00:35:51 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, darn.
00:36:17 <TheJollyRoger> This is why Signal must run in the foreground in GrapheneOS, in order to display notifications properly.
00:38:30 <matt80> Hmmm....ProtonMail's website keeps wanting to send me to the PlayStore.
00:39:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You might need to use Aurora Store (Turn on Custom tokenizer, their default one is broken) to get the APK.
00:40:38 <chmod700[m]> I've been daily driving graphene for 8 months now, very happy. Give me some monero addresses so I can send some thank you üòÅ
00:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hey chmod700[m] ! Welcome back aboard! Glad to hear you've been really enjoying GrapheneOS, arr! :D
00:41:30 <TheJollyRoger> There is now an official monero donation address at https://grapheneos.org/donate ! I think it should be two down from the top.
00:41:53 <matt80> I'm going to bail out for now and explore. Thanks for the help!
00:42:10 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: Glad to hear! If you find GrapheneOS useful, please donate to us, it keeps this ship sailing!
00:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, and fare the well, shipmate!
00:43:57 <chmod700[m]> Ty jolly, my mining pool paid out today so I'll send it üëå
00:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> chmod700[m]: woah, you rock! Thank you so much!
00:46:57 <ephemeralang[m]> Hey, guys. I know the signal messenger app has some dependency on Google Play Services, and worry that it could be a security issue. Does using Signal on a device without Google Play Services or Firebase prevent the associated code / access from working? Such as on Graphene OS?
00:47:24 <madaidan[m]> Signal falls back to using websockets if Play Services isn't available.
00:47:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hi ephemeralang[m], Signal uses GCM only for push notifications - this is so on handsets with Google Play Services, what it can do is "sleep" in the background, use no battery, and rely on Google Play to tell it "Hey, Signal, wake up, you have messages to retrieve."
00:48:35 <ephemeralang[m]> What do you think about this? If you had to run Signal on a regular android device.
00:48:35 <ephemeralang[m]> https://www.twinhelix.com/apps/signal-foss/
00:48:38 <TheJollyRoger> If your handset lacks Play Services, Signal functions without it and will instead run as a foreground service so it'll display notifications properly.
00:48:59 <TheJollyRoger> ephemeralang[m]: I think it's redundant.
00:49:13 <TheJollyRoger> The old adage "Cruft flows downstream" applies.
00:49:24 <ephemeralang[m]> Isn't it theoretically possible that Google Play Services could be surreptitiously monitor your cleartext messages?
00:49:47 <TheJollyRoger> No. They're encrypted. GCM is used only to tell Signal to wake up and display notifications while it's otherwise hibernating.
00:49:50 <TheJollyRoger> I'll explain why this is done:
00:50:59 <packetup> BIG NAME DROP
00:51:06 <packetup> @strcat:matrix.org: prepare your site.
00:51:08 <packetup> https://twitter.com/jack/status/1355295732836626432
00:51:13 <TheJollyRoger> In a study by the University of Bonn (Germany), University College London (United Kingdom), and Stanford University (United States), researchers identified that significant battery drain proved to be such a massive deterrent to users that were actively seeking a secure communication platform that it was identified as a very large obstacle toward adopting secure communication tools
00:51:48 <TheJollyRoger> packetup: woah let's... holy shit.
00:52:10 <louipc> TheJollyRoger:yep we seen this some time ago
00:52:18 <TheJollyRoger> louipc: yeah.
00:52:46 <louipc> also head of microsoft security is a fan hehe
00:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> ephemeralang[m]: They also noted that there was a big difference in the way users behaved with respect to spontaneous and planned conversations based on usage patterns of the app.
00:54:10 <TheJollyRoger> ephemeralang[m]: So what Signal did, was they decided to follow standard practices for battery optimizations, and that's to have the app "hibernate" in the background and go inactive, so it uses significantly less battery power and runs less risk of frustrating the users. The messages are first off, encrypted when they leave your phone or leave your contacts' phones. The only thing GCM is
00:54:12 <TheJollyRoger> doing, is it's telling the app to "wake up and retrieve messages from Signal's Servers."
00:55:05 <TheJollyRoger> ephemeralang[m]: I strongly suggest you simply use Signal as it is.
00:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> And keep up to date with it.
00:55:41 <TheJollyRoger> When installed onto phones without Play Services, those parts don't function because your phone won't have Play Services. It's as simple as that.
00:55:43 <narcoli[m]> https://twitter.com/jack/status/1355295732836626432?s=20
00:55:44 <narcoli[m]> jack mentionned graphene
00:56:26 <packetup> We saw. It's crazy.
00:56:54 <narcoli[m]> yup congrats everyone
00:58:03 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you can see why I just assume everyone's problem is USB now
00:58:05 <strcat[m]> usually is
00:58:20 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: that makes sense, after all this, argh.
00:58:28 <strcat[m]> either missing the Windows USB driver, missing the udev rules to make USB work on Linux or more likely using a broken port / cable
00:59:59 <TheJollyRoger> D'oh. :(
01:00:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeahh....
01:00:16 <TheJollyRoger> I'm guessing a lot of the vendors don't implement USB properly, or don't implement the full features available to USB3.1.
01:35:57 <hypokeimenon[m]> Did they contact Graphene OS to warn them of the mention?
01:38:27 <snooopy> uhm, who is @jack? :)
01:39:01 <louipc> ceo of twitter
01:39:47 <snooopy> oh.
01:39:49 <snooopy> yay :)
01:56:30 <jd1jd[m]> So I set up GrapheneOS on a pixel 4a just to test it out. If I wanted to get a larger phone such as the pixel 4 xl can I do a backup of my config to install on the new phone, or do I just need to do a clean install?
02:01:52 <TheJollyRoger> hi jd1jd[m], what you can do is take a backup using SeedVault, store it on a USB drive, then when you get a different phone, restore the seedvault backup when your new phone is first run.
02:03:05 <jd1jd[m]> <TheJollyRoger "hi jd1jd, what you can do is tak"> Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôm assuming that is after I install GrapheneOS on the phone?
02:03:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
02:04:02 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to back up everything else on the shared storage (photos, files, videos) separately.
02:04:10 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault does not back that up, only your apps and appdata and phone settings.
02:04:45 <TheJollyRoger> Note that as well there are some things that Seedvault *can't* back up.
02:04:55 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps, like Signal, use Strongbox.
02:05:00 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault can't back those up.
02:05:08 <TheJollyRoger> So Signal provides its own backup system.
02:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> Same with some other apps which set a "Please do not back me up!" flag - Seedvault has to respect those app preferences.
02:05:41 <jd1jd[m]> Thanks, anyone know is the 4XL the largest supported phone?
02:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> I think so, at the moment. The 3XL and 3aXL are going to be on the way out soon. We no longer recommend people get those.
02:08:02 <jd1jd[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I think so, at the moment. The 3"> There is no 5xl out yet correct? And no other manufacturers supported either right?
02:08:21 <TheJollyRoger> Google won't be making a 5XL.
02:08:43 <TheJollyRoger> As far as I know.
02:08:59 <jd1jd[m]> Interesting, thanks. The 5 is smaller than the 4xL so I guess the 4XL is the newest large device
02:09:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it looks like the 4XL is going to be the biggest you'll get.
02:09:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:10:19 <jd1jd[m]> As for just general privacy. If I must use some apps that I would have to get from aurora and need a cell connection is GrapheneOS that much more ‚Äúprivate‚Äù than iOS using security precautions. Can anyone speak to that?
02:10:59 <TheJollyRoger> jd1jd[m], there's a lot of nuance in that question, I don't think I can give you a simple answer on any of it.
02:11:23 <jd1jd[m]> LOL
02:11:40 <jd1jd[m]> Any general responses. I am not a total Nube
02:12:08 <TheJollyRoger> If you have to use apps you get from Aurora that are GSF dependent and don't have a fallback to run without GSF, they likely won't run at all.
02:12:08 <jd1jd[m]> But I am new to GrapheneOS only about two weeks
02:12:45 <jd1jd[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If you have to use apps you get "> Right so far I find that I can work around most of those just maybe no push notifications etc
02:12:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:13:19 <TheJollyRoger> One of the developers was saying, a good way to think of apps installed to GrapheneOS is that they're all "Ungoogled", because if they need to talk to Google they do so via Play Services, which GrapheneOS doesn't have.
02:13:40 <jd1jd[m]> But having a cell connection live all the time exposes location data to a cell provider the same on Graphene correct?
02:14:08 <TheJollyRoger> Well, your cellphone provider knowing which towers to hand off your connection to is just how the cellphone network works.
02:14:14 <strcat[m]> see https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
02:14:21 <strcat[m]> you have to use airplane mode
02:14:39 <strcat[m]> you can toggle Wi-Fi back on in airplane mode
02:14:44 <strcat[m]> it keeps the cellular radio off though
02:15:03 <jd1jd[m]> Right I understand that, that‚Äôs part of my question. There is no difference in that regard between Graphene and say iOS
02:15:07 <strcat[m]> basically airplane mode means force cellular off + toggle other radios off (but the user can turn those back on)
02:15:30 <strcat[m]> jd1jd: not really any major difference in this specific regard
02:15:43 <strcat[m]> jd1jd: we don't send nearby cell towers to an Apple / Google server to get location information though
02:16:23 <strcat[m]> we do plan to make our own form of that using a local db, inspired by other attempts at that, but more robust / user-friendly
02:17:08 <jd1jd[m]> Interesting
02:17:56 <jd1jd[m]> I am just having fun testing Graphene and differences between what I can achieve on iOS
02:19:15 <jd1jd[m]> I wish we had a bootrom exploit for iPhone 12 and could install GrapheneOS because I love my hardware ü§£
02:20:20 <louipc> yea but whos gonna port it to that phone
02:21:07 <jd1jd[m]> Just sharing wishful thinking
02:21:42 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't support a phone in an insecure and incomplete way
02:36:56 <jd1jd[m]> I‚Äôm curious, do people in here use sms with Graphene or only other services like signal or telegram
02:37:09 <koodab[m]> Signal
02:37:27 <koodab[m]> Well i use signal
02:37:38 <chmod700[m]> Only signal
02:38:14 <TheJollyRoger> jd1jd[m]: Just Signal.
02:38:16 <koodab[m]> A lot of people say telegram isnt safe
02:38:50 <jd1jd[m]> <koodab[m] "A lot of people say telegram isn"> I have heard that
02:39:25 <koodab[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWMZ17Iyu3o&t=6
02:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> Telegram uses shaky, homebrewed, unproven crypto and leaks copious amounts of metadata. What's even more embarassing is that they forgot there's a difference between a hash function and a key derivation function when they borught about "Telegram Passports" which was handling people's personal information.
02:40:27 <koodab[m]> I guess the only issue with Signal is the Phone Number
02:41:56 <jd1jd[m]> <koodab[m] "I guess the only issue with Sign"> Yeah I started a signal group chat and someone left instantly when they saw the phone number leakage LOL
02:42:18 <jd1jd[m]> It would be great if they allowed phone usage not tied to a phone number
02:42:19 <koodab[m]> Because if i was a law enforcement i would just enter you're phone number in a database and get Signal Popping up and Make a Relationship map even which i dont think signal uploads contacts and i think they hash numbers
02:42:29 <koodab[m]> Or something like that
02:42:58 <koodab[m]> XMPP for strangers Signal for youre relatives and Briar for invisible conversations
02:43:04 <TheJollyRoger> I hate to keep bringing this up again and again, but anyone who's read the study "Obstacles to adoption of secure communication tools" by the University of Bonn, Stanford, and University College London actually will know why the use of phone numbers is deliberate, even though now they're looking at ways to have more anonymous means of using the service.
02:43:42 <TheJollyRoger> You guys might balk at this, but the masses who are at their most vulnerable won't.
02:44:06 <jd1jd[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I hate to keep bringing this up "> I have not read this. Thanks
02:44:30 <koodab[m]> I reccomend Session but its in its early stages and it dosent support audio calls or video chat so we will have to see
02:44:42 <TheJollyRoger> jd1jd[m]: Yeah, it's "Obstacles to the Adoption of Secure Communication Tools" by those three universities, in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There was even a presentation about it.
02:45:01 <TheJollyRoger> Anybody who wants to criticize Signal should first read that study to understand *why* Signal was designed the way it is.
02:45:37 <TheJollyRoger> Because one of the points that that study stressed was that there is a *massive* disparity between what users want out of a communication tool, and what *we the geeks* believe them to want.
02:46:24 <jd1jd[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Because one of the points that t"> This is so true
02:46:45 <koodab[m]> Signal should have a Phone Number or Username option when you create an account it think they are working on Making Username Log in i heard it from someone but i dont know who
02:47:11 <TheJollyRoger> koodab[m]: yes, Signal has wanted to reduce reliance on phone numbers and they're starting to lay groundwork for it.
02:48:00 <jd1jd[m]> Plus I would say the majority of those interested in privacy just want to keep their information private and away from mass collection in the easiest way possible but still ‚Äúoperate normally‚Äù
02:48:01 <TheJollyRoger> jd1jd[m]: Yeah. A lot of the time people like us, who will go the extra mile to use alternative phone operating systems, we have developed a certain way of thinking. It's hard for us to transpose ourselves back into the perspective of someone who hasn't.
02:48:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:48:11 <koodab[m]> Yeah
02:49:14 <koodab[m]> Before switching to Graphene i used a Samsung and it had like 300 plus things about Bixby Gallery Samsung Galaxy Store Google play location services and all that bloatware
02:49:25 <koodab[m]> People need to start switching to Graphene
02:49:35 <jd1jd[m]> I have always operated with one foot on each side of the line.... but lately finding myself drifting further into self sovereignty as the world turns the way it is
02:49:54 <koodab[m]> People call me Paranoid
02:50:10 <jd1jd[m]> <koodab[m] "People call me Paranoid"> My family does for sure LOL
02:50:21 <koodab[m]> Wow not only me
02:50:44 <TheJollyRoger> It may surprise you to learn that confidentiality of information exchanged does not drive adoption among the majority of users. This is because most "regular average" users simply don't have faith in encryption and percieve secure communication as being futile. So this is why the way to win over userbases is network effect, because users don't /want/ more apps, more accounts, and more
02:50:46 <TheJollyRoger> passwords.
02:51:50 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, funny thing but a majority of the users that they interviewed in that study actually did not use encryption: they relied on obfuscation techniques like putting stuff into MS word documents, putting a password on the document, and then sending the document via E-mail and then phoning their recipient over a landline to tell them the password.
02:52:25 <TheJollyRoger> As strange as it's going to sound, this is what the study found.
02:52:41 <koodab[m]> Thats so dumb
02:53:00 <koodab[m]> Like really dumb
02:53:35 <TheJollyRoger> koodab[m]: yep, but that's the kind of mindset that many users end up having.
02:53:43 <TheJollyRoger> Because they don't know what you guys know.
02:54:00 <TheJollyRoger> This is why confidentiality of information exchanged does /not/ drive adoption.
02:54:20 <koodab[m]> I wouldnt trust calling over the phone i dont know if you can wiretap or if youre service provider is recording every phone call you make also any email isnt safe due to the Metadata Left
02:54:29 <TheJollyRoger> koodab[m]: Again, the users don't know that.
02:54:36 <koodab[m]> Yeah
02:55:49 <jd1jd[m]> Most average users have NO IDEA how things work technically
02:55:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:56:04 <jd1jd[m]> They just want it to work
02:56:37 <koodab[m]> I wonder what phone el chapos son have
02:56:38 <koodab[m]> I think they use Blackberries
02:56:43 <somenerd[m]> this is quite offtopic
02:56:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. They also expect contact finding to be transparent, automatic, and work with something they already have and have a high degree of confidence in. Most users aren't aware that to get your number ported out just requires convincing the kid being paid eight bucks an hour to say "Have you tried turning it off and back on again?" to port your number out.
02:56:48 <jd1jd[m]> Also now days, most people just expect everything is free or cheap because they have gotten used to being the product
02:56:51 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, yeah, haha, whoops.
02:56:57 * TheJollyRoger scoots to #grapheneos-offtopic
02:57:15 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: you're doing a better job of catching me than I am at catching myself!

04:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy phenix0! You might want to try out the new graphical installer!
04:44:37 <phenix0> Huh. Okay. Is it safe to just Ctrl+C out of the flash-all process?
04:45:19 <strcat[m]> phenix0: make sure you have a reliable USB cable
04:45:21 <b1101> depends. where is it stuck?
04:45:30 <strcat[m]> it's likely you'll run into the same issue with either cli or web install
04:45:37 <strcat[m]> phenix0: did you successfully unlock already?
04:45:39 <b1101> if it can't even start flashing for some reason, then most likely you're ok
04:45:51 <strcat[m]> you can't really screw it up with ctrl-c
04:46:06 <strcat[m]> the way it flashes is it sends a bunch of data for the image over, then tells it to flash it
04:46:28 <phenix0> strcat[m] The cable is fine. USB-C, the original that came with the phone.
04:46:33 <strcat[m]> the only risk of actually bricking it is flashing the firmware and if you cancelled sending it, it'd never attempt to flash, etc.
04:47:00 <strcat[m]> so you could brick a device by someone sending corrupt data if it fails to verify it first
04:47:11 <strcat[m]> but only for that firmware that it flashes early on
04:47:17 <strcat[m]> and you can't really cause anything like that with ctrl-c
04:47:20 <phenix0> I have launched the flash-all script fifteen minutes ago. No output in the terminal, no activity on the phone.
04:47:30 <strcat[m]> sounds like it's not working then just cancel it
04:47:44 <strcat[m]> phenix0: you successfully unlocked, right?
04:47:55 <phenix0> The bootloader? Yes.
04:47:57 <phenix0> No problem
04:48:02 <strcat[m]> run `fastboot devices` and see if it shows up
04:49:20 <TheJollyRoger> We've been encountering a lot of problems with USB - some motherboard vendors and laptop vendors don't implement all the features USB is supposed to have, some of which fastboot seems to need.
04:50:09 <phenix0> "fastboot" devices outputs a weird alphanumeric string and the word "fastboot"
04:50:20 <phenix0> "fastboot devices"*
04:52:43 <TheJollyRoger> That alphanemeric string should be your device serial number... so fastboot is enumerating devices.
04:52:56 <phenix0> Okay
04:53:00 <TheJollyRoger> Might be that the USB implementation on your motherboard is broken.
04:53:04 <TheJollyRoger> This is going to sound strange but...
04:53:21 <TheJollyRoger> you might have to try switching USB ports until you find one that works.
04:53:32 <phenix0> Heh, fair enough
04:53:45 <phenix0> Only one USB-C port though, so I'll use the USB-A
04:53:46 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't at all atypical: I've heard of laptops that have no ability to boot from USB until you find the *one* port that enabled booting via USB.
04:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, that's probably more dependable.
04:57:18 <phenix0> How long should I wait for any output before switching to the next port?
04:58:20 <user36288978[m]> I was reading up on installing graphene os before i buy a pixel and was wondering some guides said I need to install the usb driver is this necessary?  Also for a noob like me would using the new gui be prone to less issues?
04:58:53 <somenerd[m]> use the official installation guide
04:59:04 <somenerd[m]> also the WebUSB may be helpful
04:59:10 <somenerd[m]> (possibly buggy though)
04:59:22 <user36288978[m]> Got it thanks
04:59:56 <strcat[m]> user36288978: it's a Windows-specific issue: some users get the driver automatically, others need to either install it via Windows Update OR the driver from Google
04:59:58 <strcat[m]> either works
05:00:07 <strcat[m]> our recommendation is going to be Windows Update
05:00:09 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: er... just a minute or so, normally you see it start almost immediately. If after a minute you get nothing, CTRL-C it out.
05:00:12 <strcat[m]> just haven't had time to add it into the guide yet
05:00:26 <strcat[m]> if you're on Linux or macOS the driver is already part of your OS (generic USB driver)
05:00:29 <phenix0> TheJollyRoger: Thanks
05:00:47 <user36288978[m]> Thanks u guys are very helpful. :)
05:01:12 <strcat[m]> user36288978: https://grapheneos.org/install/web is working quite well now but it's still quite new and is marked experimental since it hasn't been used by a ton of people regularly
05:01:26 <strcat[m]> you could use it
05:02:19 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: Good luck! Let me know if one of those ports works.
05:02:56 <phenix0> And, um... If they don't?¬†'=D
05:03:22 <phenix0> Heck, I'd just use my work computer
05:03:37 <TheJollyRoger> If uh... if they don't, then yeah, try another device.
05:03:39 <phenix0> That one's bound to have at least one decent USB port
05:03:59 <TheJollyRoger> The good news is that GrapheneOS is signed and verified so we can always use attestation to verify it even if the installing computer might not be as trustworthy as we'd like it to be.
05:13:57 <phenix0> *sigh* Well, that was the last port...
05:14:46 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, crap.
05:14:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... fire up the work PC? :(
05:15:02 <phenix0> Yep, gonna do that now.
05:17:02 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
05:19:48 <phenix0> Okay, I'm back on my work PC
05:20:37 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
05:20:40 <TheJollyRoger> Here we go.
05:31:32 <phenix0> Ayyyy, it works!! ^^
05:31:38 <phenix0> First try
05:31:56 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: Woohoo! Welcome aboard the ship!
05:32:19 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: be sure to lock the bootloader! You should see the yellow "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen, once it's locked.
05:32:22 <phenix0> Well, I'm still not done yet)
05:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> Got it!
05:32:42 <phenix0> Of course, locking the bootloader is a very importan step =)
05:32:50 <phenix0> important*
05:33:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
05:34:58 <phenix0> Bootloader locked. Booting into Graphene...
05:35:20 <TheJollyRoger> Here we go!
05:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> Once you boot into Graphene, you can also turn off OEM unlocking, it's on by default once you install GrapheneOS the first time.
05:35:53 <phenix0> Yep ^^ Will do
05:36:06 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
05:36:42 <TheJollyRoger> You can also pair with the project's attestation server at https://attestation.app/tutorial , which should verify the integrity of the installation, and allow you to self-monitor the integrity of your phone's system partition while it's online.
05:42:19 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: how's it looking?
05:54:07 <phenix0> Looking great ^^ Sorry, got a bit lost)
06:04:15 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: Excellent!
06:19:00 <phenix0> Thank you very much one again ^^
06:19:03 <phenix0> once*
06:19:16 <phenix0> Everything works perfectly fne.
06:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> phenix0: Yarr-harr, splice the mainbrace!
06:20:51 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear it's working, if you need any help with apps or something you can also join the #grapheneos-offtopic channel, usually there's pretty active discussion there with things unrelated to GrapheneOS.
06:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> Like app stores, which apps to use, which apps work, that sort of thing,
06:21:15 <phenix0> Thanks a lot =D
06:21:25 <phenix0> Take care of yourself ^^
06:21:44 <phenix0> Have a good day)
06:21:46 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! If you find GrapheneOS useful or want to support our work, drop us something at grapheneos.org/donate ! This ship's funded entirely by donations, it keeps thi svessel sailing!
06:21:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, you too, shipmate!

08:16:11 <mistazaki[m]> Hi, How to install applications on other users. Im check vanadium browser cant enable install unknown app.
08:17:09 <b00mi[m]> Is there any possibility to use a smartwatch with GrapheneOS? Guess the most need google play services !?
08:17:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hello mistazaki[m], you must allow Vanadium to install other apps first:
08:17:59 <TheJollyRoger> Settings -> Apps & Notifications -> See All Apps -> Vanadium -> Advanced -> Install Unknown Apps (Set to "Allowed")
08:18:19 <TheJollyRoger> Apps you install through Vanadium MUST be the same version OR NEWER VERSIONS as apps installed in other profiles.
08:19:15 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hello mistazaki, you must allow "> Hi TheJollyRoger  it says disable by admin
08:21:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, very strange. I don't see that here.
08:22:15 <TheJollyRoger> b00mi[m]: Huh, never tried that actually.
08:33:42 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Apps you install through Vanadiu"> Im aready allow vanadium with owner acc. But when i go other user, still cant on.

08:36:56 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi mistazaki, Understood, let me"> Ok.
08:40:38 <TheJollyRoger> mistazaki[m]: do you have any Device Admin apps installed?
08:41:11 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mistazaki: do you have any Devic"> No. What admin app apk?
08:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok - just wanted to rule that out first...
08:43:13 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ok - just wanted to rule that ou"> So what i need to do?
08:43:22 <TheJollyRoger> I'm stumped. I don't know yet.
08:44:27 <mistazaki[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'm stumped. I don't know yet."> ü§£
08:44:48 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
08:53:43 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run for the night.
16:58:57 <lms5> Trying to download graphene os on a new unlocked pixel 4a. Won't flash, gets stuck on "waiting for any device". tried using minimal adb, sdk platinum tool, usb driver update, powershell, can't get it to work. Disclaimer: Im not that techy. Pls help. Thanks!
17:01:52 <Chicomsstolemylu> Try running powershell as admin
17:04:07 <lms5> I saw that option, but the instructions said not to
17:05:26 <lms5> tried that, says the item i selected is unavailable
17:21:08 <entry1[m]> <lms5 "Trying to download graphene os o"> Most likely it is an issue with the USB cable you are using if you are getting that error. Also could be the USB port. Do you have some other cables to test out? Preferably the one that came with the device?
17:23:03 <lms5> I'm using the cable that came with the device, I also tried a different cable. unfortunately, this comp only has one usbc port
17:28:56 <nick30012021> Hi guys, having similar problem when trying to flash current sunfish-factory-2021.01.23.03 to new Pixel 4a, flashing fails with console error¬† "fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable.". If anyone has an idea what is the cause, please let me know. Thanks for any tips.
17:34:09 <silicon_jim[m]> What command are you running right before this?
17:35:04 <silicon_jim[m]> Off topic - is there anyway to get cash app or robinhood running on non google play services builds like graphene?
17:35:44 <lms5> maybe aurora store?
17:35:45 <Pratyush[m]> nick30012021  are you on windows ?
17:35:58 <nick30012021> yep, I m on windows
17:36:10 <nick30012021> running standard ./flash-all.bat
17:37:02 <martin90> hi, I just messed up the installation on a pixel 4a ... as it turned out I had not enough space on my hard disk, so the installer stopped

17:38:24 <silicon_jim[m]> Boot into recovery and start fresh? Recover your backup
17:39:01 <martin90> Just want to install grapheneOs
17:39:24 <silicon_jim[m]> Oh you mean on your computer hard drive
17:39:51 <martin90> yes, thats why the update failed
17:39:59 <martin90> I can make some space on my computer
17:40:05 <martin90> but should I start the script again?
17:40:16 <silicon_jim[m]> What's the phone doing?
17:40:29 <martin90> I'm in the bootloader I Think
17:40:34 <martin90> it says fastboot mode
17:40:39 <martin90> and device state: unblocked
17:41:01 <martin90> didn't do any think since it failed
17:41:43 <silicon_jim[m]> <nick30012021 "Hi guys, having similar problem "> Try a different computer? I had trouble getting adb to work on a dell but had success on a different model
17:43:23 <nick30012021> @silicon_jim - ok, will try that, thanks, but my old pixel 3 worked without any problems on this PC&setup
17:44:27 <martin90> fastboot -w --skip-reboot update image-sunfish-2021.01.05.03.zip is this the command which failed?

17:46:53 <martin90> Or It could be any place, I do not know at which step it failed
17:48:38 <Pratyush[m]> martin90  When device reboot while flashing do you press any button on device if yes please don't
17:48:52 <martin90> no didn't press any button
17:49:35 <Pratyush[m]> Looking into console output
17:51:12 <Pratyush[m]> wait a sec?
17:51:12 <Pratyush[m]> archive does not contain 'recovery.img'
17:51:12 <Pratyush[m]> Are you sure your download is fine ?
17:51:53 <martin90> I hope so
17:53:17 <martin90> image-sunfish-2021.01.05.03 thats the name of the image
17:54:02 <Pratyush[m]> Does not look to me.
17:54:02 <Pratyush[m]> I will recommend you download it fresh in some other folder and extracting it on same folder and retry.
17:54:02 <Pratyush[m]> Something like desktop/gosfresh
17:54:41 <Pratyush[m]> Or you might be downloaded ota file instead of full firmware.
17:55:47 <martin90> I'm downloading again
17:57:44 <martin90> https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2021.01.23.03.zip
17:57:44 <martin90> this is what I'm downloading, and what I was downloading before, but I'll check , maybee something got corrupted
17:58:02 <martin90> however could it be related to the fact that I did not have enough space on my computer harddisk?
17:58:25 <martin90> when I checked I only had 200mb left, and I thought maybee thats the reason why I screewed up
17:58:57 <martin90> but how do I proceed then
17:59:02 <martin90> the batch file was allready running
17:59:13 <Pratyush[m]> Hmmmm i don't know how it even possible because every build include recovery.img and your output says not found which is not what i expected.
17:59:13 <Pratyush[m]> So there is a good chance your download is half finished or you may moved file from extracted dir
18:00:00 <Pratyush[m]> <martin90 "however could it be related to t"> yes that might be the case, free up some space about 1gig or so and re extract the file and try again
18:00:43 <martin90> Okay, but can I rerun the entire batch file? Or do I need to start at specific command?
18:01:11 <Pratyush[m]> <martin90 "the batch file was allready runn"> Close that terminal clean up extracted folder, make some free space at least a gig or two and re-extract the downloaded file and try again
18:01:39 <martin90> okay thank you I'll try that
18:02:15 <Pratyush[m]> <martin90 "Okay, but can I rerun the entire"> No bootloader or system can be flashed again and again no problem with that so basically you should do from start
18:21:00 <martin90> I tried it again, this is what happened: https://pastebin.com/5mACJvLA
18:21:58 <martin90> I redownloaded the zip file, and this time I had enough space on my computer harddisk
18:42:23 <martin90> Now I did run it again, this time the process was not aborted by an error
18:42:23 <martin90> https://pastebin.com/8Y7FiaQF
18:42:24 <martin90> Only what is confusing me are these messages saying "archive does not contain..." I hope this is nothing crucial. I will now proceed with locking the bootloader again
18:47:56 <martin90> Pratyush[m] thanks for your help. It booted now and graphene os is running
18:51:01 <take_a_deep_brea> nice .
18:51:56 <dan-is-a-bloody-> hey all
18:52:34 <dan-is-a-bloody-> got a quick Q for all da privacy kings üëëüëëüëëüëë
18:53:35 <dan-is-a-bloody-> how sure r we that the fuzzy fingerprint hash stored on the phone isnt sent anywhere?
18:55:16 <dan-is-a-bloody-> and here's anotha Q
18:55:35 <dan-is-a-bloody-> is there any hope for GPay ever being available for GrapheneOS users?
18:57:43 <TheJollyRoger> lms5: Please do not use minimal adb... unless you want to cause a brick.
18:59:50 <TheJollyRoger> lms5: Minimal adb or those third-party ADBs, ADBs that are packaged via your operating system (except on Arch and Manjaro) are liable to brick your device, cause security issues, or other nasty things. You may want to simply use the web installer. Note that installing GrapheneOS uses the entire feature set available to USB, which some motherboard vendors don't adequately implement, so you may
18:59:52 <TheJollyRoger> need to try switching the ports, using different cables, or worst comes to worst, trying on a different computer. Use a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable.
19:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> You could consider getting one from Anker that properly implements the USB 3.1 specification, since most USB cables are cheap, shoddy affairs that only support the barest minimum needed by some devices and most vendors are looking to pinch pennies wherever they can. I've actually found that the cables that come with Pixels, while they are adequate for installing the operating system, aren't
19:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> actually fully traced either.
19:03:37 <TheJollyRoger> dan-is-a-bloody-: Your biometrics aren't transmitted anywhere. Google Pay most likely won't be brought to GrapheneOS if it relies on Play services, which this project considers invasive.
19:03:50 <TheJollyRoger> (or rather, some elements of it are, and as a result it won't be included)
19:04:12 <dan-is-a-bloody-> TheJollyRoger: thx for da info bruv
19:04:38 <sliplov9[m]> Hey again! Am installing the os on a 4a and got the following error: Failed to boot into user space fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable. Rebooting into bootloader
19:04:50 <TheJollyRoger> sliplov9[m]: Have you tried the web install?
19:05:08 <sliplov9[m]> No. Is that what you would recommend now?
19:05:36 <TheJollyRoger> sliplov9[m]: yes. It recieved some updates last night that should increase its stability.
19:06:13 <sliplov9[m]> The phone is still connected to the computer and is currently in  Fastboot mode with the bootloader unlocked. How should I proceed?
19:06:29 <dan-is-a-bloody-> are there any good GPay alternatives my bruvs, ones that work on our phones
19:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> We've been having a large number of people come in with problems after following a shady, outdated video that advises to use a third party fastboot with may brick your phone, edit a persistent system variable, so the web installer is a harm reduction/ease of use measure.
19:07:10 <sliplov9[m]> Go straight to the the web install?
19:07:59 <sliplov9[m]> That's a good measure. In this case I just filled the guide as instructed. It's worked for me before - I'm setting this one up for someone else
19:08:07 <sliplov9[m]> Followed*
19:08:16 <TheJollyRoger> sliplov9[m]: go to https://grapheneos.org/install/web and start at the step where you left off.
19:08:35 <sliplov9[m]> OK. Thanks! I'll update soon.
19:09:02 <TheJollyRoger> sliplov9[m]: note that the web install process is a tiny bit slower. You must NOT disturb the phone until it returns to the bootloader menu.
19:09:21 <TheJollyRoger> sliplov9[m]: while it's in fastbootd, data is being sent to the phone to populate the update slot.
19:09:28 <TheJollyRoger> sliplov9[m]: so don't disturb it while this is going on.
19:10:52 <TheJollyRoger> dan-is-a-bloody-: Not really. The merchants have to accept it. In interim, you could use a credit card or if you don't want to register and open an account with a financial institution, a charge card.
19:17:53 <sliplov9[m]> I wasn't able to click on the buttons using the web install. It did however finish without error when I tried again using the command line guide
19:18:07 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ye TheJollyRoger m8 i know i can use a card thx for da recommendation ü§£
19:18:07 <dan-is-a-bloody-> its fine, its not a big deal to carry the card
19:18:28 <dan-is-a-bloody-> just a minor QoL improvement not to have to carry it
20:27:44 <hobo8818[m]> Do you sugest using VPN or Orbot
20:54:36 <fatrightbobama[m> hobo8818: neither.
21:02:26 <fatrightbobama[m> If you need torrenting in a country with bad laws, sure VPN can be handy. Or if you find yourself trapped too often in airports/hotels etc.
21:03:00 <fatrightbobama[m> Otherwise, a tor browser is all you need for that ‚Äúextra protection‚Äù
21:03:18 <fatrightbobama[m> I personally use NextDNS too.
21:05:28 <alex-resist> Hello, just wanted to say that I successfully flashed a Pixel 3a from a 3a XL today. It took quite a bit longer than usual, but that was expected, and everything is working fine now. Yesterday it didn't work (got stuck) so it is an obvious improvement.
21:05:41 <louipc> nice

21:09:12 <koodab[m]> Yes
21:09:25 <koodab[m]> I do
21:10:09 <rafff[m]> do you use the provided Magickeyboard to allow any copy/paste to/from the clipboard to be deleted after being used?
21:10:23 <koodab[m]> No
21:10:51 <rafff[m]> does the GoS keyboard already provide this functionality?
21:11:41 <koodab[m]> i don't know all i do is copy and paste my password from a HTML file then paste it to my keepassdx to access my passwords
21:12:40 <rafff[m]> ok...Magickeyboard is supposed to do that and then delete it after being used
21:12:52 <rafff[m]> just wanted to confirm if anybody is using it
21:14:05 <koodab[m]> Do you use Protonmail?
21:14:54 <koodab[m]> im having trouble signing up anonymously it asks for a phone number or a gmail
21:15:39 <rafff[m]> no sorry
21:15:49 <rafff[m]> try tutanota
21:16:09 <rafff[m]> it has an apk on fdroid too and has a free account option

21:17:29 <louipc> hey guys. checkout #grapheneos-offtopic for more chat about nongrapheneos services and apps and stuff
21:17:56 <koodab[m]> Okay
21:18:18 <louipc> koodab[m]++
21:18:35 <rafff[m]> can the clpiboard be deleted?
21:18:45 <rafff[m]>  * can the clipboard be deleted?
21:18:46 <koodab[m]> No
21:26:21 <lms5> TheJollyRoger I deleted the minimal adb and sdk i previously downloaded. When looking at the official instructions, i noticed that there's a dl.google.com address to download fastboot from. However, i keep getting a 404 message when trying to go to that page.
21:30:52 <strcat[m]> lms5: use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
21:34:16 <lms5> strcat[m] i tried that but there's no option to unlock the bootloader
21:34:25 <strcat[m]> there is
21:34:33 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader
21:34:35 <strcat[m]> it's there
21:34:41 <strcat[m]> lms5: make sure you're using a browser with WebUSB support
21:34:52 <strcat[m]> on Windows you can use Edge
21:34:54 <strcat[m]> you already have it
21:37:09 <lms5> strcat[m] im on google chrome, just downloaded last night for this
21:37:32 <strcat[m]> that works too but Edge is fine for this
21:37:33 <strcat[m]> either works
21:37:44 <lms5> all i see is start, rest. bootloader, recovery, rescue, barcode and off
21:37:56 <strcat[m]> lms5: you do it from the web page
21:37:57 <strcat[m]> not the device
21:38:07 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader
21:38:12 <strcat[m]> you press the button there, then confirm it on the phone
21:39:22 <lms5> holy shnap lol. okay, i just did that. it says there's no compatible device
21:39:57 <strcat[m]> lms5: make sure you have the driver https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
21:41:50 <lms5> strcat[m] i downloaded the usb driver, is that what you mean?
21:42:25 <strcat[m]> yes
21:42:34 <strcat[m]> lms5: what kind of cable are you using
21:42:44 <strcat[m]> the most common issue is using a low quality USB cable or port
21:45:52 <lms5> native union usb a to usb c
21:52:28 <beep_beep> Hi, new install on Pixel 4a here. Is it normal on boot to have a black screen with yellow text that says "other operating system"
21:52:47 <beep_beep> followed by the google logo, then finally the grapheneOS logo?
21:54:28 <strcat[m]> beep_beep: yeah, that's what you should expect
21:54:28 <silicon_jim[m]> Yes. I see that ad well
21:54:29 <strcat[m]> the brand of the phone is a Google Pixel and the bootloader shows the logo for that
21:54:29 <Chicomsstolemylu> Yep
21:54:30 <strcat[m]> if we had our own device it could have a GrapheneOS OEM logo
21:54:30 <silicon_jim[m]> If you double click it speeds up
21:54:56 <strcat[m]> either way same bootloader code
21:54:56 <strcat[m]> (mostly)
21:55:03 <strcat[m]> verified boot shows a notice that you're using a custom OS - it means it's working and that you locked properly if it's yellow and says booting another OS
21:55:12 <strcat[m]> that means it's verifying with the GrapheneOS verified boot key that was flashed
21:55:23 <beep_beep> Got it, thanks!
21:55:28 <strcat[m]> and yeah if you really want you can press power 2x to pause and unpause to make it go faster
21:55:32 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much difference
21:56:25 <beep_beep> By the way, the logo and animation from the "welcome" or setup sequence look fantastic
21:56:34 <beep_beep> they might look really good on startup
21:56:56 <beep_beep> Or, i would get a lot of satisfaction out of seeing that animation more often
21:58:02 <strcat[m]> https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/abl/tianocore/edk2/tree/QcomModulePkg/Include/Library/LEOEMCertificate.h?h=LA.AU.0.0.1_rb1.22
21:58:06 <strcat[m]> basically in our own device
21:58:19 <strcat[m]> this would have our verified boot public key
21:58:48 <strcat[m]> so then for official GrapheneOS (stock OS) it wouldn't have a notice
21:58:57 <strcat[m]> https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/abl/tianocore/edk2/tree/QcomModulePkg/Library/BootLib/DrawUI.c?h=LA.AU.0.0.1_rb1.22
21:59:04 <strcat[m]> and we'd have our own logo for it to draw when loading the OS
21:59:37 <beep_beep> is that in the works?
22:00:35 <strcat[m]> in early stages of figuring out a hardware partnership
22:00:43 <strcat[m]> it's a very long term thing
22:02:02 <lms5> i have the option to download two dif possible updates for fastboot: android composite adb or android bootloader. Do either of these sound right?
22:03:27 <strcat[m]> bootloader
22:04:27 <lms5> it worked!
22:10:15 <louipc> nice
22:11:46 <lms5> and i didnt even need the $20 usba to usbc cable i ran out and bought
22:13:15 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "https://source.codeaurora.org/qu"> woa that would be awesome
22:14:11 <strcat[m]> lms5: just make sure to lock after flashing then it's all done
22:14:11 <strcat[m]> and gets verified when booting so you know it worked properly
22:22:04 <lms5> Worked like a charm. Grapheneos is installed. dont take this the wrong way, but i love you üòÇ
22:30:23 <madaidan[m]> Daniel is taken
23:14:46 <mishmasher[m]> Anyone here using Orbot as full time VPN? I have a question. Every time I don't use my phone for hours orbot freezes and refuses to make a connection to the internet. I have to force shutdown the app in settings and then start it to get it working again. I have removed it from the battery optimization list and was wondering if there is something else that I can do in the settings?
23:15:48 <mishmasher[m]> I don't like having developer settings open but, perhaps there is something there I can do?
23:22:15 <silicon_jim[m]> In just curious the motivation for routing all traffic via tor
23:22:25 <silicon_jim[m]> I would switch to nextdns instead
23:22:48 <silicon_jim[m]> If you're worried about ISP spying
23:25:29 <silicon_jim[m]> But don't feel obligated to address my curiosity. perhaps you could set a cron job to periodically restart orbot using tools in the f droid store
23:25:46 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> It might also be about hiding your IP from the sites you visit
23:25:59 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Or, I guess, any servers your apps connect to in this case
23:26:54 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I have my Public profile routed through Orbot, but I don't have it for that long usually, so something like this hasn't happened to me
23:27:07 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I will probably transfer that profile to just a VPN, tbh
23:27:30 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And maybe route only some things through Tor
23:28:11 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Now, if only Coinbase verified my account
23:28:26 <silicon_jim[m]> I mean it would make sense to route only onion destined traffic via it. But I'm interested in how you accomplished routing only your public profile traffic via it
23:29:03 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I have Orbot enabled as an always on VPN in the public profile and I log out of other profiles, when I go there
23:29:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And that profile is logged out, when I am in some other profile too
23:30:12 <silicon_jim[m]> And you're using multiple profiles setting to accomplish that?
23:30:20 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yes
23:30:27 <silicon_jim[m]> Interesting
23:30:31 <silicon_jim[m]> Good stuff
23:31:16 <silicon_jim[m]> I know a lot of sites block for traffic, so would be interested in knowing if this causes issues w connectivity
23:31:28 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yeah, and logging out of profiles when not using them is an important step, since apparently Android can't do different VPNs at the same time even if they are for different profiles
23:31:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "I know a lot of sites block for "> My public profile doesn't have such services
23:31:54 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I usually use those in other profiles
23:32:06 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Like for example my banking app is in my personal profile
23:32:17 <silicon_jim[m]> Just seems like a lot of manual leg work to rely on
23:32:25 <mishmasher[m]> I just like all my traffic routed through tor rather then any other VPN that's the main reason.
23:32:45 <silicon_jim[m]> If we could specify which public IPS are allowed to various services at the service level - that would be ideal
23:32:56 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I mean, it's just a few button clicks: end session -> go to profile menu -> choose another profile -> enter the password
23:33:08 <silicon_jim[m]> Its just that I feel like you may be attracting more ATTN doing so
23:33:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "Its just that I feel like you ma"> That's most probably true
23:33:52 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Again, I will probably transfer the public profile to using a VPN, since I mostly care about servers just not seeing my IP
23:33:54 <silicon_jim[m]> But then again, always on TOR w n JavaScript running in the apps, might not be a bad idea
23:34:08 <mishmasher[m]> <silicon_jim[m] "Its just that I feel like you ma"> Bridged
23:34:09 <silicon_jim[m]> Browser apps
23:34:52 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Again, I will probably transfer "> I want to get Mullvad, which I why I am waiting for Coinbase to verify my account
23:34:59 <silicon_jim[m]> So when I configure orbot in vpn mode, all traffic goes thru that or only the apps you select?
23:35:18 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> You can have only selected apps go through Orbot
23:35:25 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Or system-wide
23:35:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> You can't have Orbot as a VPN, if you are using another VPN, of course
23:36:03 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> But you can still route apps that have their own proxy settings
23:36:14 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Or are aware of Orbot on their own
23:36:14 <mishmasher[m]> <silicon_jim[m] "But don't feel obligated to addr"> But, this is interesting. Got any recommendations?
23:36:20 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Or are aware of Orbot on their o"> Like F-Droid
23:37:27 <mishmasher[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: but, you are not experiencing this problem I have?
23:37:52 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> As I said, I usually don't have the public profile running for long
23:38:19 <silicon_jim[m]> Something like script manager
23:38:37 <silicon_jim[m]> Or terminal emulator and modify cron ?/
23:38:40 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I think, madaidan. mentioned running Orbot, maybe he knows
23:39:01 <mishmasher[m]> Aah dang it, wish I could solve this cause I am forcing all my traffic through orbot
23:39:18 <mishmasher[m]> So when it freezes I don't get notifications
23:39:41 <silicon_jim[m]> Vpn made sense when http was still a thing. I suppose the ISP can still ascertain the SNI in the request of a https request but beyond that, were talking deep level inspection
23:40:06 <silicon_jim[m]> You're already encrypted with modern tls sites
23:40:14 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "Vpn made sense when http was sti"> Well, in my case, I want to specifically hide the IP from the destination
23:40:23 <silicon_jim[m]> Makes sense
23:41:05 <silicon_jim[m]> I mean if you're that concerned, maybe look at tails or qubes
23:41:35 <mishmasher[m]> <silicon_jim[m] "I mean if you're that concerned,"> I use both
23:41:51 <mishmasher[m]> But need a mobile variant
23:41:56 <silicon_jim[m]> I don't like the idea of running sensitive ops on. a device that has an embedded  microphone and camera
23:42:50 <mishmasher[m]> <silicon_jim[m] "I don't like the idea of running"> Neither do I. Lol.
23:42:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Well, laptops also have that
23:43:06 <silicon_jim[m]> Go analog. Chromebook or Linux box with that crap physically disabled. Cash ofc
23:43:19 <silicon_jim[m]> No ties are the best
23:44:07 <madaidan[m]> <mishmasher[m] "Anyone here using Orbot as full "> In my experience, visiting specific websites (particularly news sites) makes it die.
23:44:43 <silicon_jim[m]> The issue with VPN service is that you have to pay for it somehow. All CC transactions  ediscoverbale. All BTC traceable
23:44:57 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "The issue with VPN service is th"> But Monero isn't

23:45:35 <silicon_jim[m]> Tru. But not aware of any mainstream VPNs that accept it
23:45:36 <mishmasher[m]> I agree but, in certain cases you have to use a phone. So might aswel make that aspect as secure as possible
23:45:44 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Or rather requires much more eff"> So anyone tracing Monero just for me is out of the threat model

23:47:29 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "But for me, I need cash app and "> I have Gmaps in the Work profile, since that profile has Google, or should have Google (Gmail doesn't even start, lol), anyway
23:47:48 <silicon_jim[m]> That's the limiting factor in all this

23:48:04 <silicon_jim[m]> I need to have authy
23:48:10 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Well, you can enable IMAP support in your account settings
23:48:19 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And then use FairEmail
23:48:30 <silicon_jim[m]> You can't go off the grid entirely on mobile yet from what I've gathered
