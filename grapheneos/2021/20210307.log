00:02:52 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "the signature is checked"> Only upon installation. Apps can still be persistently compromised.
00:03:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> madaidan.: not really
00:03:31 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "madaidan.: not really "> How so?
00:03:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> if you believe otherwise you're welcome to replace apps with adb root and see if they even launch
00:04:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> anyway if you're adb root there's other ways to do that anyway
00:04:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> i could just copy the application data, uninstall and install a malicious version and restore the data
00:04:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> mostly works
00:05:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> but then again madaidan.  how does verity solve this?
00:05:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> there is no root of trust for apps anyway
00:05:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> unlike the os
00:05:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> also v4 is strictly installation time rn
00:06:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> a v3 or lower signature is still required
00:10:01 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "if you believe otherwise you're "> That doesn't answer the question. When exactly are signatures being verified then?
00:10:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "That doesn't answer the question"> installation time only for v4
00:10:54 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "installation time only for v4"> You just said, "not really" after I said they're only verified upon installation.
00:11:06 <madaidan[m]> sar
00:11:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "You just said, "not really" afte"> out of context tbh
00:12:43 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "out of context tbh "> I'm confused. What exactly prevents an app from being persistently compromised by an attacker?
00:13:30 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: signatures are verified at install time and also for certain other operations to do with the apk
00:13:44 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: what v4 provides is that it can do continuous verification when reading the blocks of the apk
00:13:49 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: based on first party source
00:14:36 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/FileIntegrityManager
00:15:14 <madaidan[m]> strcat So apps can be persistently compromised unless they're a first party app using v4 signatures?
00:15:26 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: an app can't write to the app's own apk
00:15:28 <strcat[m]> so no
00:15:41 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the app doesn't get to write to their apk / libraries
00:15:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> madaidan.: no
00:15:51 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: this is about verified boot, i.e. if the OS is compromised
00:15:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> v4 is just to install an app incrementally
00:16:06 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no it's not just for that
00:16:31 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: there's already fs-verity used for an out-of-band priv-app update, etc.
00:16:39 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: this makes it more generally available
00:16:43 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: an app can't write to"> Ah, that makes sense. Thanks.
00:16:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> so the platform keeps the signature file?
00:16:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> ah
00:16:59 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: if you compromise an app, you can't write to the apk / libraries
00:17:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> so they are using fs-verity
00:17:15 <strcat[m]> yes this already existed
00:17:22 <strcat[m]> for a subset of system apps (for out of band updates)
00:17:29 <strcat[m]> this is a standard API for external apps to benefit
00:17:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: aware tbh
00:17:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> i have an implementation on op7
00:17:43 <strcat[m]> if the v4 signature is just from the app devs then it does little good in this regard
00:17:59 <strcat[m]> the point is that say, for our first party repo
00:18:06 <strcat[m]> we are making the v4 signatures
00:18:19 <strcat[m]> and we include our certificate for that as a 1st party source of v4 signatures
00:18:20 <strcat[m]> in the OS
00:18:59 <strcat[m]> and then for example, a user could toggle on only running code from trusted sources, enforced this way
00:19:09 <strcat[m]> and it's better enforcement than just install time, it's continuous verification
00:19:11 <strcat[m]> when reading blocks
00:19:27 <strcat[m]> similar to the existing verified boot for the OS, but for all code/data in apks of user installed apps from the 1st party source
00:19:33 <strcat[m]> it can also be used for apps signed by others
00:19:44 <strcat[m]> and it's useful for those too
00:20:01 <strcat[m]> it's basically verified boot for components not part of the base OS
00:20:14 <strcat[m]> fs-verity was already used to do verified boot for priv-app updates, etc.
00:20:23 <strcat[m]> and APEX has verified boot for out-of-band OS component updates
00:20:36 <strcat[m]> this is for things not part of the OS in any way with a stable, standard API
00:20:52 <strcat[m]> it gives you what you need to provide better security than iOS code signing if you desire
00:20:57 <strcat[m]> because it covers the whole apk
00:21:38 <strcat[m]> if you wanted you could only support apps with 1st party v4 signatures and then you'd have a superior take on this than iOS but ofc we can't do that for our general usage version of the OS
00:21:49 <strcat[m]> anyway the OS infrastructure for that is present now
00:22:23 <strcat[m]> we need to get our own app install/update system implemented (would help if people realized not just how flawed F-Droid is but how much more can be done via being able to leverage all this stuff)
00:23:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat i dunno if the infrastructure is present yet btw
00:23:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> fs-verity is enabled 4a and newer afaik
00:23:33 <strcat[m]> it is
00:23:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> f2fs cannot be updated to support verity either
00:23:48 <strcat[m]> the infrastructure is there
00:23:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> you have to format it with the verity option
00:23:51 <strcat[m]> it doesn't matter if the older devices don't have it
00:24:12 <strcat[m]> and this is beyond the existing fs-verity usage from before Android 11
00:24:32 <strcat[m]> it opens it up to being leverage for stuff not bundled with the OS, not just out-of-band updates for OS apps
00:24:36 <strcat[m]>  * it opens it up to being leveraged for stuff not bundled with the OS, not just out-of-band updates for OS apps
00:24:59 <strcat[m]> also not sure this is fs-verity based
00:25:00 <strcat[m]> APEX isn't
00:25:04 <strcat[m]> you're assuming that
00:28:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> apex is dm-verity
00:34:16 <strcat[m]> yeah since it has a nested filesystem
00:34:34 <strcat[m]> haven't looked closely into the v4 signature implementation

02:25:23 <Anon20938[m]> Are there any GrapheneOS pixel phones being sold?
02:25:40 <strcat[m]> yes
02:25:43 <strcat[m]> not by the project
02:25:44 <case_[m]> Hi, not about grapheneos but I was wondering, is it possible to uninstall all gapps on a pixel? Just stay with android stock without gapps and if I needed install microg?
02:25:59 <Anon20938[m]> But where though?
02:26:22 <strcat[m]> case_: microG requires OS integration and provides an implementation of Google services as part of implementing a subset of the OS APIs
02:26:28 <strcat[m]> so you definitely can't use that there
02:26:41 <strcat[m]> case_: it's off-topic for this channel overall
02:27:10 <strcat[m]> Anon20938: there are multiple companies selling phones with GrapheneOS, and individuals selling them
02:27:10 <case_[m]> Thanks for the reply
02:27:16 <Anon20938[m]> Do you know where it's being sold?
02:27:41 <strcat[m]> I know of a dozen vendors selling them, sure, have you looked?

02:29:52 <k5L37> Can confirm. It really is very easy.
02:41:27 <chi00[m]> couldn't be any easier
02:49:09 <oooohshini[m]> Does grapheneOS use ntp for time sync? Can it be disabled even for gps?
02:52:03 <redbeard72> Howdy. Is it possible to import a Contacts CSV file into the default phone app? (I can't find a way)
02:52:20 <ulmirdin[m]> Yes, do it through the contacts app
02:52:27 <k5L37> https://time.grapheneos.org/ for ntp
02:53:14 <k5L37> That's default but can be disabled in settings
02:53:26 <madaidan[m]> <oooohshini[m] "Does grapheneOS use ntp for time"> No, GrapheneOS securely connects to grapheneos.org and extracts the time out of the HTTP header. It does not use NTP due to security and privacy concerns.
02:54:06 <madaidan[m]> <k5L37 "https://time.grapheneos.org/ for"> NTP isn't used at all.
02:54:48 <madaidan[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
02:55:04 <k5L37> I stand corrected
02:55:53 <dnull> redbeard72: Looks like you can import vcf
02:55:53 <redbeard72> ulmirdin[m]: google contacts only lets me export a CSV file and looks like the contacts app only accepts a VCF file. Any advice?
02:56:48 <dnull> redbeard72: https://www.textcompare.org/csv/csv-to-vcard
02:56:52 <dnull> Maybe?
02:58:48 <ulmirdin[m]> <redbeard72 "Howdy. Is it possible to import "> My bad. I meant importing VCF files. It's late, getting the letters all messed upüôÉ

03:13:18 <redbeard72> dnull: I tried https://www.textcompare.org/csv/csv-to-vcard, when I tried import the file it produced the contacts app told me "couldn't import vCard. The format isn't supported." Any other tips?

03:21:17 <strcat[m]> oooohshini: obtaining time zone from carrier isn't NTP (neither is the unused functionality of using the carrier provided time in AOSP)
03:21:44 <strcat[m]> time zone doesn't actually change the stored time either just determines the offset for display, etc.

03:25:20 <strcat[m]> it is UTC at a low-level
04:08:16 <fred56> Hello. I have some questions about using multiple users with Graphene. Anyone care to chat?
04:08:55 <rny> just ask your questions
04:10:11 <fred56> OK, I'm new, just three weeks with the phone. What is the strategy behind using multiple users? Why do people choose to do it. What do they get out of it?
04:10:44 <bauershades[m]> Does GrapheneOS (and strcat ) what to have more exposure and blog post about GOS or is it better to keep it kind of low profile?
04:10:50 <strcat[m]> fred56: they're isolated workspaces with separate instances of apps, with separate app and profile data
04:11:39 <strcat[m]> bauershades: that's fine but would be nice if people actually understood and communication the purpose of the project rather than getting it all wrong and thinking it's about removing Google apps/services from an OS (AOSP) that doesn't have those in the first place
04:11:47 <strcat[m]>  * bauershades: that's fine but would be nice if people actually understood and communication the purpose of the project rather than getting it all wrong and thinking it's about removing Google proprietary apps/services from an OS (AOSP) that doesn't have those in the first place
04:11:56 <strcat[m]>  * bauershades: that's fine but would be nice if people actually understood and communicated the purpose of the project rather than getting it all wrong and thinking it's about removing Google proprietary apps/services from an OS (AOSP) that doesn't have those in the first place
04:12:29 <fred56> Ok, Why would I choose to use the to activate the work profile rather than just use regular users?
04:13:08 <strcat[m]> our recommendation is using user profiles as isolated workspaces
04:13:21 <strcat[m]> fred56: also read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
04:13:33 <strcat[m]> each user profile has separate encryption keys protected by their lock method
04:14:39 <fred56> What would be a typical strategy for different users. What apps would you want to isolate?
04:15:19 <strcat[m]> fred56: apps are already sandboxed either way
04:15:33 <strcat[m]> the purpose is being able to have separate workspaces with separate instances of apps and profile data
04:15:58 <fred56> And why would you want that?
04:16:04 <strcat[m]> many reasons
04:16:09 <strcat[m]> start by reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
04:17:02 <fred56> Ok, thanks I will. I'm new to Linux, Graphene, and this is my first irc chat! I appreciate your time.
04:17:36 <sjsndnjdejd> <fred56 "And why would you want that?"> some apps won't launch and force you to give access for things
04:42:42 <mishmasher[m]> And if I would delete an user profile encrypted with a strong password, would that data be retrieve-able with forensic tools?
04:43:53 <mishmasher[m]> Law enforcements for example would they be able to retrieve the data from the encrypted profile
04:44:34 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encrypted please
04:44:38 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: no
04:44:46 <strcat[m]>  * read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption please
04:45:22 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: if you delete a user profile with a weak 4 digit PIN it won't be recoverable
04:45:35 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: it's covered there, don't really understand what you're confused about
04:46:18 <strcat[m]> the encryption keys are randomly generated and encrypted by key encryption keys that are never stored
04:46:27 <strcat[m]> key encryption keys use lock method as one input
04:46:39 <strcat[m]> I don't really know how to cover it better than what we have there
04:50:02 <mishmasher[m]> strcat: worst part of this is I have read all of that. I assumed it would be amazingly hard to retrieve that data but, some words I just don't understand haha
04:50:28 <strcat[m]> it isn't retrievable, a high entropy token needed to derive the key is wiped
04:50:58 <mishmasher[m]> Thank you!
04:51:01 <strcat[m]> if you use a strong passphrase then even if you don't wipe anything it's not obtainable without that no matter what exploits they have, that's the point of using a strong passphrase
04:51:30 <strcat[m]> if you use something like a random 6 digit PIN then it's secure but depends on the secure element's security so if they can compromise that they can bypass it
04:51:39 <strcat[m]> think we cover it all well there
05:01:29 <mishmasher[m]> Thanks strcat this is much clearer language for someone like me haha. I'm going to re-read the site and research the "techy" words I don't understand this time haha
05:01:57 <strcat[m]> because the site has to cover more
05:02:02 <strcat[m]> not just a very specific question
05:07:19 <mishmasher[m]> True. Either way bless you for taking the time to always explain.
06:01:00 <IRCX6[m]> Ahhhh thanks strcat

Ive been looking around and I havent seen many people talking about putting something like manjaro arm on their phones so I was wondering if this is even possible
06:30:05 <strcat[m]> sure but only GrapheneOS is on-topic for this room
06:30:50 <snikita[m]> can you point me to a good resource about using alternative mobile distros? i cant seem to find much
06:31:01 <strcat[m]> this is one
06:31:28 <snikita[m]> > only GrapheneOS is on-topic for this room
06:31:49 <strcat[m]> yes and GrapheneOS is an alternative mobile Linux distribution
06:32:14 <snikita[m]> i meant alternative to android. i was wondering if anyone puts other linux distros on their phones besides android based ones
06:32:22 <strcat[m]> other OSes could support the same flashing method, take advantage of verified boot and other hardware security features, etc.
06:32:27 <strcat[m]> they don't have to be Linux-based at all
06:32:34 <strcat[m]> there's no inherent reason they have to be
06:32:41 <snikita[m]> i know theres been a lot of development on manjaro ARM, and some other ones because of the pinephone, so im wondering if those distros can be used on a pixel

I need some guidance here, if someone can help...i've successfully enabled developer mode and oem unlocking. and i've booted into the
10:18:58 <iOSconvert4help> bootloader interface. but when i connect the device to my computer (win10 pro - updated last night) and click "unlock bootloader," the webusb interface does not see the pixel 4. The error message is: "No compatible devices found." that's as far as i can get. thinking that it could be a driver issue, i did as the instructions suggested, and
10:18:58 <iOSconvert4help> installed all Optional Updates in windows update, too. Same result. Please advise. Thanks.
10:28:23 <catfish[m]> Can you try a different usb port or cable? That is the most common issue.

10:52:51 <iOSconvert4help> donkykong[m] - regrettably, this is my day.... but i take your point.
10:54:19 <catfish[m]> There is this part some people miss in the guide. Connect the phone to the computer. On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot now: In Windows Update, click Check for updates. After that there might be a link "View optional updates." Download and install any driver updates.
10:55:10 <iOSconvert4help> catfish[m] -did that after it failed the first time.
11:00:27 <catfish[m]> Another common problem is using the browser in incognito mode but don't think that is your problem. I'd recommend rebooting everything and starting again following the instructions exactly.
11:19:14 <iOSconvert4help> catfish[m] - not in incognito mode; will try restarting devices and taking the instructions from the top. thanks.
11:38:27 <mynacol[m]> iOSconvert4help: Connect the phone after you went into the bootloader interface, then manually search for Windows updates. Maybe then the right driver pops up.
11:39:33 <mynacol[m]> iOSconvert4help: And the original USB cable should be fine. Maybe switch USB ports on the computer or try on an entirely other one (if the driver stuff didn't work)

17:03:51 <gnome_giga_vegan> i am running grapheneos on a pixel3  it does not seem to be fast charging.  i have tried plugging in and using wireless charger.  is a limitation of the os?
17:05:56 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: No. Fast charging is fully supported on GrapheneOS and it works fine for me on Blueline.
17:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Check to ensure your charger and cable combination fully support Qualcomm Fast Charging.
17:06:40 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: many problems relating to USB in GrapheneOS happen as a result of substandard USB cables which don't adequately or fully support charge negotiation or chargers that don't either.
17:07:45 <gnome_giga_vegan> everything worked on my previous phone a samsung s9plus using regular android
17:08:07 <gnome_giga_vegan> i bought this pixel3 second hand is there a possibility there is something wrong with it?
17:09:05 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: quite possibly, yes. Toward the end of a phone's life,
17:09:25 <TheJollyRoger> what generally happens is that the resellers flood the market with handsets in an effort to cut their losses and prevent the stock from going stale.
17:09:26 <gnome_giga_vegan> if i replace battery could that help?
17:09:47 <TheJollyRoger> This not only includes carrier/bootloader locked devices, but also refurbs, which many shady sellers won't tell you are refurbished.
17:10:05 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: You might also need to replace the USB slot in case the prongs are broken or the USB chip has malfunctioned.
17:10:07 <gnome_giga_vegan> mine was a used phone from a individual so i knew it was used
17:10:18 <TheJollyRoger> Doing so is about the the cost of a Pixel 4a.
17:10:32 <TheJollyRoger> Roughly $300 Canadian for the replacement of the USB slot, and more for the battery.
17:10:48 <gnome_giga_vegan> how can i verify it is charging fast or regular?  maybe i am misreading the phone is there a section where it would say "fast charging"
17:11:09 <demonmachina[m]> dang 4a.... just a littttttttle bigger in the hand and it's annoying. This up and down game with phone sizes is irritating. 3a size was perfect.
17:11:18 <demonmachina[m]> really the 3 for that matter
17:11:20 <TheJollyRoger> That's a rough deal, because this October, that phone will be EOL and stop getting firmware updates from Qualcomm, stop getting security updates from upstream, and we will be forced to discontinue support for it.
17:11:51 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: it will say "charging rapidly." Note that it will only charge rapidly if the phone detects it is safe to do so, and automatically select the speed that's best for the health of your battery.
17:12:22 <TheJollyRoger> It will also automatically select what capacity of the battery (ie: when to go into idle maintenance/trickle) to prolong your battery health far better than you ever could.
17:13:41 <TheJollyRoger> So, speaking hypothetically, if the previous owner did stuff like what we did to gadgets in the 2000's or early 2010's such as only charging to a certain threshold and then unplugging the phone or not leaving the phone plugged in, that can actually damage the battery.
17:13:42 <gnome_giga_vegan> it just says "charging wirelessly" at the bottom of the screen when locked...
17:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: Plug it in to something that supports qualcomm fast charging.
17:16:17 <gnome_giga_vegan> says "charging" when plugged into usb c cable
17:17:07 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: If your phone's battery is low, and you're charging it like this, it's phone's detecting your charging setup's unsafe to use full speed charging.
17:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> *your phone's detecting that your charging setup's unsafe to
17:17:39 <gnome_giga_vegan> okay i will fully charge and then let it go down a little and then retry,  at that point it should fast charge is available?
17:18:02 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: Let it go to 50% and then try with the official Google branded charging cable and charger.
17:19:25 <TheJollyRoger> gnome_giga_vegan: note that in order to fast charge wirelessly, you MUST use an official Google wireless charger

18:57:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> That bot bug is now fixed
19:02:03 <harrisonford[m]> im a newbie. not sure if this is the right group here, but maybe someone can point me in the right direction-- if i download an app from google play store into Graphene (i want the BETA of AnySoftKeyboard since it has Swipe, but they push it thru Google store) does that compromise my now degoogled phone and let google in?
19:09:38 <pizzaeater69[m]> I think you can get Anysoftkeyboard from f-droid. If not then from Aurora store that you can get from f-droid.
19:09:39 <pizzaeater69[m]> It should not compromise your device
19:11:53 <noustfurkuphater> Any linux distro I can run on a pixel that is in similar security level to graphene?
19:12:52 <pizzaeater69[m]> Not really
19:13:18 <noustfurkuphater> darn
19:13:25 <harrisonford[m]> > <@pizzaeater69:matrix.org> I think you can get Anysoftkeyboard from f-droid. If not then from Aurora store that you can get from f-droid.
19:13:25 <harrisonford[m]> > It should not compromise your device
19:13:25 <harrisonford[m]> yes, i can get the alpha version in Fdroid but it doesnt have swipe, which i use all the time. if i want the Beat which has swipe they send me to Googel PLaystore. now that im finally getting free from Google i want to make sure the BETA wouldn't be reporting back to the google mothership :)
19:14:48 <r0tt0r[m]> <noustfurkuphater "Any linux distro I can run on a "> i didnt try on gos but anlinux app from fdroid allows running linux on android
19:14:56 <mr_hebi_san[m]> You can't really know unless you examine the source code.  Its open source, so you could.  It looks like you could even just build it yourself and not have to use what's on Play or on Fdroid
19:18:37 <dannyknoll3[m]> Good riddance, jesus
19:22:05 <ulmirdin[m]> Is it just me or calendar app disappeared after the beta update?
19:23:10 <dannyknoll3[m]> ulmirdin: There is no usable calendar app, it was a placeholder, probably shortcut removed.
19:24:12 <bill_in_mtl[m]> it's in the beta changelog - shortcut removed
19:24:24 <ulmirdin[m]> I know. I was just used to it being on my app list lol.
19:28:53 <strcat[m]> it's still present for users who don't install another calendar app so that when apps try to open calendar events there is something to handle it
19:29:05 <strcat[m]> so it works for the intended purpose without confusing people now
19:29:25 <strcat[m]> i.e. if you install a calendar backend other apps can show you events, create events, etc. via this app
19:29:36 <strcat[m]> but we aren't going to lead people to using it anymore
19:29:39 <strcat[m]> because it's nearly useless
19:29:52 <strcat[m]> so people don't have to be concerned with the fact that it's present
19:30:10 <strcat[m]> if you install another app it'll give you a choice between them when an app wants to view a calendar event and people can choose the one they installed instead
19:30:12 <strcat[m]> it's a simple change
19:39:19 <ulmirdin[m]> I remember when I first install grapheme and tried to make a calendar event in the app. I was like how the hell do you use this thingüòÖ
19:39:31 <ulmirdin[m]> * I remember when I first install graphene and tried to make a calendar event in the app. I was like *how the hell do you use this thing*üòÖ
19:39:57 <strcat[m]> basically: we are not inclined to bundle any third party apps in the OS
19:40:02 <strcat[m]> for reasons I've explained before
19:40:08 <ulmirdin[m]> Removing it was a good decision.
19:40:20 <strcat[m]> only launcher icon is removed
19:40:25 <ulmirdin[m]> * Removing it from the app list was a good decision.
19:40:42 <strcat[m]> we are going to have our own app install/update system and we can make first party packages of apps in there and take advantage of the new verified boot feature extending it to a first party repository
19:41:06 <strcat[m]> and then we can add a SetupWizard page with a list of those apps and you can check a box next to them to install them as part of the initial setup
19:41:19 <strcat[m]> and that way if we decide to remove an app all we have to do is remove the suggestion
19:41:43 <strcat[m]> vs. being stuck bundling it in the OS forever since removing a bundled app would make users lose their data since suddenly the app is gone
19:42:06 <ulmirdin[m]> I believe Calyx does something like this. It's definitely a great thing to have.
19:42:07 <strcat[m]> same approach as how the stock OS now encourages you to install certain apps as part of their setup wizard
19:42:43 <strcat[m]> ulmirdin: they bundle a bundle of third party apps including ones with major privacy/security issues
19:42:47 <strcat[m]> and I prefer not talking about that here
19:42:56 <strcat[m]> also F-Droid is totally unacceptable for inclusion or as a way to do this
19:43:27 <strcat[m]> at most it can be packaged in our repo
19:43:29 <ulmirdin[m]> <strcat[m] "and I prefer not talking about t"> Copy that
19:43:29 <bizanon[m]> That sounds amazing
19:43:29 <strcat[m]> but... it can't because it doesn't meet the minimum standards that will be enforced for that
19:48:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "at most it can be packaged in ou"> Never tbh
19:50:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need high quality apps to be there
20:03:44 <Duxy[m]> I just use pen and paper as my calendar :)
20:05:00 <pizzaeater69[m]> Good, I use papermap and compass as maps :D okey I live in Finland so here this is normal
20:06:45 <Duxy[m]> I have OsmAnd installed but barely use it
20:12:56 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Great I'll put in a feature request for GOS to deliver a paper calendar and pencil for the next update :)

20:21:01 <skagreek[m]> strcat: Hope you're well. Can't remember this, but I recall being forced to use the recovery code on my first backup last month. I installed a new OS and did a fresh backup (as if I was new), and it didn't ask to create a recovery code. I still forced it to use, but curious if something changed, or if I forgot.

21:18:49 <maxikskwefsgsg> vanadium sends information due safe browsing to google! what is that for a policy????
21:19:39 <strcat[m]> no it doesn't
21:19:51 <strcat[m]> please stop making stuff up, thanks
21:20:03 <strcat[m]> it has safe browsing disabled by default and anyway... it isn't implemented right now
21:20:12 <strcat[m]> the toggle for it doesn't do anything on GrapheneOS
21:21:04 <maxikskwefsgsg> well it shows "no protection" (not recommended)
21:21:19 <strcat[m]> as I said
21:21:24 <strcat[m]> safe browsing is disabled by default in Vanadium
21:21:44 <strcat[m]> and the toggle doesn't do anything atm because we don't have Play services and that's how it's implemented
21:22:00 <maxikskwefsgsg> and standard protection says: vanadium MAY send URL (...) to Safe Browsing...
21:22:16 <strcat[m]> can you please read what I've written?
21:22:58 <maxikskwefsgsg> i do not understand, why you give the option even if it is not implemented
21:23:26 <strcat[m]> so you're upset because we haven't removed the configuration option, which is disabled by default?
21:23:37 <strcat[m]> we want to provide an implementation of it which doesn't depend on Play services
21:23:53 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure why you're so upset about having the ability to turn something on
21:24:00 <strcat[m]> sorry for wanting to leave you with a choice
21:24:07 <maxikskwefsgsg> just confused me an lead me to a false accusation. sorry for that
21:24:26 <strcat[m]> we disable it by default because for the time being we haven't overhauled/changed it
21:24:38 <maxikskwefsgsg> alright, thx for the explanation
21:24:38 <strcat[m]> but it depends on Play services on Android anyway so it does nothing atm
21:24:51 <SRC> Did an update just go out a bit ago?
21:25:02 <strcat[m]> SRC: https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
21:26:35 <maxikskwefsgsg> love your work, by the way. ciao
21:26:43 <SRC> That is dated 3/6 yesterday. Any idea why I wouldn't get until just now? I'm in the US
21:26:59 <strcat[m]> SRC: read https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
21:27:19 <strcat[m]> SRC: are you aware that releases go through a testing channel, then the Beta channel, before getting to the Stable channel?
21:27:30 <strcat[m]> they're announced right before being pushed out via Beta
21:27:36 <strcat[m]> it's all covered there
21:28:27 <skagreek[m]> Does seedvault force encryption and the use of a phrase by default?
21:28:50 <strcat[m]> it only does encrypted backups
21:29:07 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use a passphrase, it uses a seed phrase to generate a high entropy key
21:29:12 <strcat[m]> don't really understand what you're asking
21:29:46 <skagreek[m]> Yeah, it was weird, my last backup (with no records of prior backups, new usb), didn't give me the phrase like my last time. All new install and usb, etc.
21:30:09 <strcat[m]> you seem confused
21:30:09 <skagreek[m]> i could be :)
21:30:10 <strcat[m]> what exactly are you asking?
21:30:12 <strcat[m]> it never does unencrypted backups...
21:30:19 <skagreek[m]> right.
21:30:33 <strcat[m]> skagreek: you restored a backup, why would you need a new seed phrase?
21:30:39 <skagreek[m]> my first time using seedvault, it gave me the 12 words and forced me to save it and type it.
21:30:47 <skagreek[m]> no, this is all fresh.
21:30:48 <strcat[m]> because you restored the backup
21:31:02 <skagreek[m]> didn't this time, i deleted my entire backup history
21:31:19 <strcat[m]> I don't really understand what you're confused about
21:31:50 <skagreek[m]> lets say i'm a first time user, new install. doesn't it present you the 12 words?
21:32:00 <strcat[m]> if you set it up
21:32:46 <skagreek[m]> i remember the first backup i did, it showed me the 12 words and i saved it. this time, with a completely new install and no backups, it didn't present me the phrase.
21:32:59 <skagreek[m]> i know it's frustrating to hear from us users.
21:33:01 <strcat[m]> skagreek: I really don't know what you're confused about
21:33:06 <strcat[m]> it's not frustrating to hear from users
21:33:33 <strcat[m]> skagreek: it is NOT supposed to show you seed words during the initial setup
21:33:40 <strcat[m]> it's not enabled by default
21:33:49 <skagreek[m]> ok.
21:33:49 <strcat[m]> it is opt-in
21:34:11 <skagreek[m]> i'll take this one as early Alzheimer's. Totally forgot my first setup.
21:34:13 <strcat[m]> Seedvault backups are only enabled if you manually set it up
21:34:28 <strcat[m]> it doesn't prompt you to set it up during the initial setup wizard
21:34:57 <skagreek[m]> Ok that makes sense now. Sorry to trouble you for that one. I'm really forgetting things.
21:35:15 <skagreek[m]> I'm not that dumb btw. lol
21:35:22 <skagreek[m]> (maybe slightly)
21:37:52 <skagreek[m]> one more question. How many devices do you usually mess with, for fresh installs and testing?
21:38:08 <SRC> I am unable to add any events or reminders to the calendar although I have both events and reminders enabled in calendar settings?
21:38:24 <strcat[m]> which calendar?
21:39:04 <strcat[m]> there's no bundled calendar provider
21:40:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I‚Äãickhitterextraordinaire> Ooo what's in the new update
21:40:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> I am happy that Vanadium exists. I wonder if it is better than Bromite ‚îÄ does it have always-on incognito by default?
21:40:20 <mr_hebi_san[m]> SRC: If you haven't updated yet, the old AOSP calendar is gone.  It was more or less read-only anyway and it never allowed you do actually add anything to it
21:40:28 <strcat[m]> it's not gone
21:40:44 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Fair, it does exist, but the icon is gone
21:42:37 <gapheneuser001> Hi there, has the most recent update broken the system UI for anyone else? Userdata seems fine and the phone is mostly functional but the UI reverted to a white theme, I can't access quick settings, other user profiles, ringtone was reset etc. I initially thought it was a bad update, because when I clicked reboot the screen went black but never
21:42:37 <gapheneuser001> rebooted. UI was still responsive based on sound and haptic feedback but there was no display. I hard rebooted after a few more minutes but the boot was very quick, didn't seem like an update was installed and the UI was having problems. I tried flashing the OTA manually through ADB but nothing changed.
21:42:49 <strcat[m]> no, it hasn't
21:43:31 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: are you sure you have a proper install of GrapheneOS?
21:43:38 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: bootloader is locked, and it passes verification?
21:44:15 <gapheneuser001> Yep, it has been stable since the initial release of graphene.
21:44:28 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: that's not really an answer to the question
21:45:06 <gapheneuser001> Oh sorry, yes the bootloader is locked and it was passing attestation fine so I assume that means it passed verification...
21:48:03 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: I don't think whatever is wrong for you is connected to anything with the update
21:48:12 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: and it's not possible to have a 'bad update' where it doesn't get properly installed
21:48:49 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: recommend reading about how the update system works
21:49:14 * zrtjhzjarh8694[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qKoceTjFKDSfXBXDZCMPrpRg/message.txt >
21:49:27 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: the update is installed in the background by the update app, and then it tells you when installation is completed
21:49:33 <strcat[m]> it's already installed at that point
21:49:41 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: it doesn't
21:50:17 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: the Network permission disallows direct and indirect network access, it doesn't change the state of unrelated controls like those
21:50:49 <strcat[m]> they aren't relevant when an app doesn't have network access
21:51:29 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: sounds like the result of doing something with adb, a device manager, etc.
21:51:34 <jalb> I lost the fingerprint in the last update to 3a, but no problem. Only that
21:51:47 <jalb> I did it again and solved
21:51:59 <strcat[m]> jalb: don't think that was connected to an OS update
21:52:19 <jalb> strcat[m]: it was only after the last update, I don't know
21:52:25 <strcat[m]> people frequently associate things with an OS update which are really not tied to it because it's the reason they rebooted
21:52:25 <jalb> Never happened bedore
21:52:29 <jalb> *before
21:52:31 <zrtjhzjarh8694[m> <strcat[m] "they aren't relevant when an app"> OK, thanks for the clarification.
21:52:41 <strcat[m]> jalb: no real reason to think it's connected to the update
21:52:43 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: as I said
21:52:49 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: not relevant when the app doesn't have network access
21:52:56 <jalb> ok, maybe another reason, idk
21:53:10 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: I don't really understand what you're asking
21:53:18 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: the switch wouldn't be there if it didn't work
21:54:07 <strcat[m]> jalb: when was the last time you rebooted before the last update? probably the previous update
21:54:11 <gapheneuser001> Yeah I assumed the internal update did a verification much like the side loading verification. It's just that the problem only began after I tapped reboot from the updater. I only accessed the device though ADB after the problem occurred and only using the adb devices and sideload command. Would a backup with seedvault be able to restore my
21:54:12 <gapheneuser001> userdata if I reflash the OS?
21:54:22 <jalb> strcat[m]: only after the previous update
21:54:39 <strcat[m]> jalb: yeah, so any problem that you would only notice after a reboot you are only going to notice after an update
21:54:43 <jalb> but in these days we received some udpated, not too long
21:54:44 <strcat[m]> does not mean that it's tied to updates
21:54:52 <jalb> that's true
21:55:10 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: it doesn't just do verification
21:55:15 <jalb> is it normal to lose the fingerprint after rebooting?
21:55:24 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases and https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
21:55:41 <strcat[m]> jalb: if there is something wrong with it then it is possible it got deleted during verification of data on boot
21:55:48 <jalb> ok thanks
21:55:59 <strcat[m]> jalb: I don't know how that could happen in practice
21:56:11 <jalb> anyway it's not important
21:57:47 <jalb> I also saw that in my 2 profiles, in 1 of them the 3 button changed but not in the other profile
21:57:54 <jalb> I changed it and no problem
21:58:12 <strcat[m]> jalb: that's a known issue with user profiles
21:58:18 <strcat[m]> jalb: not related to updates in any way
21:58:22 <strcat[m]> user profiles can lose certain settings right now
21:58:24 <jalb> ah interesting :)
21:58:32 <jalb> didn't know, thanks
21:58:37 <strcat[m]> there's an open issue and it's an AOSP issue
21:58:51 <strcat[m]> an issue is filed upstream about the main form of the issue
21:58:57 <zrtjhzjarh8694[m> <strcat[m] "zrtjhzjarh8694: the switch would"> If I understood correctly the discussion here above, the "safe browsing" option does not work even if enabled because it requires Google Services (which are not available in GOS).
21:58:58 <jalb> strcat[m]: does the calls and messages work ok in profiles?
21:59:04 <jalb> I never tested
21:59:29 <gapheneuser001> I just read through them and I understand that they use signature verification so it shouldn't be related, and yet I'm still having these UI issues. Any ideas for how I might go about fixing these issues? Would a backup with seedvalt, reflashing and restoring potentially work?
21:59:42 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: now you're turning the discussion into something completely different and it doesn't make any sense
21:59:53 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: that is not what you were talking about and isn't what we were talking about
22:00:05 <strcat[m]> why are you talking about Vanadium and that previous discussion now?
22:01:04 <zrtjhzjarh8694[m> I was merely wondering if that switch was another one that had no impact if on or off.
22:01:05 <zrtjhzjarh8694[m> You answered. Thanks!!
22:01:38 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: it wouldn't be there if it had no impact, as I said
22:01:53 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: I don't understand what this has to do with the previous discussion
22:02:13 <strcat[m]> Vanadium has that toggle because it does have support for using it but on GrapheneOS the support isn't available
22:02:30 <strcat[m]> you can't compare the situation of that app with some completely unrelated thing in the base OS itself
22:02:57 <strcat[m]> jalb: yes it works as designed
22:03:09 <SRC> So what is a recommended secure calendar to replace the aosp calendar and where should it be downloaded from?
22:03:11 <jalb> thanks!
22:03:38 <jalb> never said enough: thanks for your great work strcat[m]
22:03:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> <SRC "So what is a recommended secure "> Use the one that comes with the OS
22:04:06 <jalb> and all the team, of course
22:04:29 <ruach> Is voice input disabled in GOS? I searched the board and didn't find much. When I hit the mic on my keyboard I get "Voice input is not installed on your device".
22:04:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> gapheneuser001: did you ever do anything with adb?
22:05:13 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: I don't really understand what issue you're having but it's definitely not connected to the update and you were already having the issue before booting up the new OS as you explained: it did not reboot (when running the old version)
22:05:15 <zrtjhzjarh8694[m> <strcat[m] "Vanadium has that toggle because"> For a new user (like me), it is difficult to distinguish if/when GOS provide support for functionalities. You answered my question. Thanks for your time & answer!
22:05:48 <gapheneuser001> No, only when I installed the OS and just an hour ago when I followed googles OTA update guide to flash the 3/6 GOS OTA.
22:06:01 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: considering how you acted when you first came in the room with the false claims about that toggle
22:06:13 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: and now the fact that you are trying to find ways to keep talking about it and complaining about it
22:06:16 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: looks like concern trolling to me
22:06:39 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: it is not confusing to new users, rather, you are still trying to create an issue out of us having that toggle offered in Vanadium
22:06:51 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: and at this point, it has crossed the line over what I'm willing to tolerate
22:07:22 <strcat[m]> also the switch of username made it unclear that this was the same person
22:08:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> gapheneuser001: OK
22:08:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can you try booting to safe mode?
22:08:41 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: as you said above, you were running a previous version of the OS (you hadn't booted up the new version) and it didn't shut down / reboot properly
22:08:48 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: so, that's a clear indication the issue was not the OS update
22:08:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Could be one of your apps breaking something
22:08:54 <strcat[m]> gapheneuser001: you already had some issue previously
22:08:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: don't think so
22:09:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <amnesiadroid> I'm not a grapheneos user yet but I wonder if IPv6 privacy extensions are enabled by default?
22:09:31 <strcat[m]> please see https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
22:09:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: don't think so"> There's terrible apps that do nonstandard stuff and cause system ui crashes
22:09:45 <gapheneuser001> Thanks, good to know there's no issues with the update! Something is still definitely broken for me though, I'd be happy to try and explain it in more detail but I'm not sure how much good that'll do. I'll attempt a full backup and reinstall and report back if it doesn't work. Oh I didn't try safe mode, I'll try that and report back before the
22:09:46 <gapheneuser001> reinstall. Thanks for all the help!!
22:09:48 <strcat[m]> IPv6 privacy extensions are enabled by default but the Linux kernel implementation of them doesn't work well
22:09:52 <strcat[m]> recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
22:09:56 <SRC> I was just told the calendar in the OS is gone or no longer included. I still have it in my phone but it's useless if you can't add events/reminders to it
22:10:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example reporting a null state to system ui
22:10:14 <strcat[m]> SRC: you're misunderstanding
22:10:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <amnesiadroid> Alright, i'll have a read. Thanks
22:10:38 <strcat[m]> SRC: GrapheneOS does not include a calendar provider, and that isn't a recent change
22:11:04 <strcat[m]> SRC: it includes the infrastructure for calendar providers and a very basic UI for other apps to use to view events, etc.
22:11:12 <Lotus[m]> you can use etesync for syncing calendar
22:11:40 <strcat[m]> SRC: there was previously a launcher icon for the basic viewer, etc. but that was remove because users were confused by having it as an app they could launch
22:11:40 <SRC> So what should I use for a calendar? I don't want to install something that is insecure
22:11:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just hang a physical calender in your room
22:12:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Very secure
22:12:11 <strcat[m]> because people wrongly thought that the AOSP Calendar app actually provides a calendar rather than providing a way to view calendars provided by other apps
22:12:13 <SRC> Lol
22:12:19 <strcat[m]> so we addressed that by removing the launcher icon
22:12:19 <zrtjhzjarh8694[m> <strcat[m] "also the switch of username made"> Didn't change my username. Just reading here to try to learn more about GOS.
22:12:21 <strcat[m]> to avoid the confusion
22:12:52 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Recommendation for apps should probably be in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org anyway
22:13:01 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: the concern trolling is inappropriate for the channel
22:13:17 <pinguin74> hi there, is there issues with weather apps on gos? using "your local weather", granted location permission, the app can often not detect location....
22:13:20 <strcat[m]> zrtjhzjarh8694: if you didn't change your username then what you're doing makes even less sense
22:13:33 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: no, there isn't
22:13:45 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: GNSS-based location takes some time to get a lock
22:14:10 <strcat[m]> we don't send nearby Wi-Fi networks, cell towers, Bluetooth devices to a server which returns back a guess of your location like Play services
22:14:11 <skagreek[m]> Try WEAWOW weather app, pretty coool
22:14:11 <strcat[m]> and we won't
22:14:21 <jalb> wow receiving new update now :D
22:14:25 <strcat[m]> so you'll just have to accept that it takes some time to get a location fix
22:14:31 <pinguin74> ok, gnss differs from gps ?
22:14:35 <strcat[m]> and some apps wrongly assume that they can get a rough estimate really quickly
22:14:36 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: no
22:14:39 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: GNSS includes GPS
22:14:56 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: GPS and the other GNSS implementations take some time to get a location fix
22:15:00 <strcat[m]> it isn't instant
22:15:06 <pinguin74> ok, thought gnss stands for glonass ;-)
22:15:10 <FBI[m]> <pinguin74 "hi there, is there issues with w"> You can try Geometric Weather from F-Droid it dosent need any permissions except network
22:15:21 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: no GNSS includes GPS, GLONASS and other implementations
22:15:36 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: the devices can use more than GPS
22:16:12 <strcat[m]> if you aren't connected to the internet or cellular network at all, then it would be completely normal for GNSS (GPS, etc.) to take 10 minutes to get a location fix
22:16:25 <strcat[m]> being connected to the internet allows fetching GPS almanacs which speed it up
22:16:32 <pinguin74> "your local weather" uses "local mls" and "nominatim"
22:16:36 <strcat[m]> being connected to a cellular network with working SUPL further speeds it up
22:17:08 <strcat[m]> so it can end up taking < 1 minute to get a location fix but it does take a bit of time
22:17:24 <strcat[m]> it won't just nearly instantly return a guess based on nearby Wi-Fi networks, etc. since we aren't sending that data to a service
22:17:35 <ruach> When I hit the mic on my keyboard I get "Voice input is not installed on your device".¬† I get the option to download from the store but that goes nowhere.
22:17:43 <strcat[m]> some apps are broken and don't support waiting long enough to get a location fix
22:17:55 <pinguin74> thnx for explaining !
22:17:59 <strcat[m]> ruach: an implementation of voice input isn't included in the OS
22:18:10 <strcat[m]> you would have to install one
22:18:59 <jalb> is it ok to stop some apps that communicate to internet (messaging apps, email...) when switching to another profile to avoid some "leaks" or it's nonsense?
22:19:03 <ruach> Thank you.
22:19:27 <strcat[m]> jalb: you can end session for a secondary user profile as a whole
22:19:34 <strcat[m]> jalb: it's not clear why you think it would help to do that
22:19:43 <strcat[m]>  * jalb: it's not clear why you think it would help to do that in the context you mention
22:19:59 <jalb> strcat[m]: I do, but when using the other profile, if they share wifi, I was worried about connecting in the background
22:20:03 <jalb> Maybe a nonsense
22:20:06 <strcat[m]> jalb: disabling internet access for an app and then allowing it later would accomplish what?
22:20:20 <jalb> I don't know...
22:20:31 <strcat[m]> jalb: why would it matter if it connected?
22:20:39 <strcat[m]> jalb: if you're just going to allow it to connect again later?
22:20:47 <jalb> are the apps in the main profile continue sending information to the internet?
22:20:56 <strcat[m]> you can end session on a user profile or force stop apps but I do not think what you're talking about makes sense
22:21:05 <jalb> strcat[m]: I use another server in the vpn of the other profile
22:21:08 <strcat[m]> there is a reason to end session on a profile
22:21:16 <mynacol[m]> Also wanna throw another weather provider in the ring: https://v2.wttr.in/New%20York
22:21:25 <strcat[m]> jalb: the owner profile always runs
22:21:36 <jalb> strcat[m]: that's what I mean,
22:21:45 <jalb> so, stopping some apps don't help?
22:21:46 <strcat[m]> jalb: you can end session on secondary profiles
22:21:54 <strcat[m]> jalb: you don't have to do stuff in the owner profile
22:22:07 <strcat[m]> beyond the initial unlock and managing other profiles or global device settings
22:22:18 <strcat[m]> jalb: no, that's not what I'm saying
22:22:26 <strcat[m]> jalb: it's not a good way to approach what you want
22:22:28 <jalb> strcat[m]: I mean if I do something in another profile but I'm afraid the main profile sendind information of who I am
22:22:46 <strcat[m]> jalb: you've got a misunderstanding on how you should be approaching things
22:22:48 <jalb> Email, etc
22:22:54 <jalb> Yes, that's why I ask
22:23:00 <jalb> maybe it's nonsense
22:23:05 <strcat[m]> jalb: yes but you're asking the wrong kind of questions
22:23:13 <strcat[m]> you're asking about how you think it should be done in a very specific way
22:23:15 <jalb> what could I do, then?
22:23:19 <strcat[m]> instead of about what you're trying to accomplish
22:23:26 <strcat[m]> that makes it hard for people to answer and leads to bad answers
22:23:28 <jalb> yes
22:23:33 <jalb> ah ok
22:23:40 <strcat[m]> ask about what you want to achieve not about how you think it should be done
22:23:44 <strcat[m]> I've figured out now what you want to do
22:23:46 <strcat[m]> so I can give an answer
22:23:59 <jalb> I want to change to another profile and not being identified by what's sending the main profile
22:24:09 <strcat[m]> jalb: make a secondary profile to use as your main personal profile
22:24:09 <jalb> is it possible?
22:24:23 <strcat[m]> jalb: your issue is using the owner profile as your main personal one
22:24:29 <jalb> oh
22:24:32 <strcat[m]> instead of a secondary profile with end session available
22:24:38 <jalb> great idea!
22:24:47 <jalb> a lot of work to move things but interesting
22:24:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Sounds to me that GrapheneOS can do a lot of things without root. Man, I wish I had a Google Pixel.
22:25:02 <strcat[m]> jalb: you could also force stop all relevant apps
22:25:07 <strcat[m]> jalb: but...
22:25:10 <strcat[m]> that's pretty error prone
22:25:19 <strcat[m]> jalb: that seems way too hard
22:25:28 <jalb> yes, true
22:26:09 <jalb> I must think to use another profile as my main profile, thanks
22:26:28 <strcat[m]> the owner profile always has to run because it's where system stuff runs
22:26:44 <strcat[m]> the low-level term for the owner profile is system profile
22:26:48 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "instead of a secondary profile w"> Btw, do you still recommend to use secondary profile as the main profile in AOSP which doesn't have the logout function. Are there any practical benefits doing that in AOSP ?
22:26:53 <jalb> and avoid apps connecting to internet in the unusued main profile
22:26:57 <vdge[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> instead of a secondary profile with end session available
22:26:57 <vdge[m]>  * Btw, do you still recommend to use secondary profile as the main profile in AOSP which doesn't have the logout function. Are there any practical benefits in doing that in AOSP ?
22:27:15 <jalb> strcat[m]: thanks
22:27:19 <strcat[m]> vdge: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption still gives another reason that you might want to do that
22:27:36 <strcat[m]> jalb: you don't really have to avoid apps connecting to the internet just ones doing it in a way that would be problematic for what you want
22:27:47 <strcat[m]> jalb: it doesn't matter that stuff like Updater runs in the owner profile and will still be connecting
22:27:51 <jalb> yes, that's true
22:28:07 <jalb> avoiding messaging apps, email, etc
22:28:14 <strcat[m]> vdge: if you reboot the device, you have to unlock owner
22:28:36 <strcat[m]> vdge: so, pretend you boot up the device somewhere you don't want to have your personal data not at rest
22:28:49 <strcat[m]> vdge: or don't want to enter the passphrase to unlock it
22:29:00 <strcat[m]> vdge: that's a reason to use a secondary profile as your main personal profile
22:29:16 <strcat[m]> same reason as wanting to take advantage of end session
22:29:29 <strcat[m]> the reason: the owner profile has to be active for the device to be usable
22:29:51 <jalb> interesting
22:30:00 <strcat[m]> secondary users depend on the owner profile being active since it handles certain system wide things
22:31:00 <strcat[m]> for example, most stats, etc. are stored encrypted in the owner profile
22:31:17 <strcat[m]> there's a lot of system wide stuff that needs somewhere to store sensitive data
22:31:22 <strcat[m]> that place to store sensitive data is the owner profile
22:31:33 <strcat[m]> the device isn't fully active until you've done the initial unlock of the owner profile
22:31:40 <strcat[m]> that's why you can't login to a secondary user until you've done that
22:32:23 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "vdge: so, pretend you boot up th"> Hmmm that makes sense. Kinda like soft plausible deniability. Wish AOSP adopts the 'end session' feature.
22:32:41 <strcat[m]> vdge: AOSP has the feature but it's only for enterprise device deployments
22:32:54 <strcat[m]> we're just making a fancy enterprise feature available to end users
22:33:02 <strcat[m]> we didn't really implement it
22:33:04 <strcat[m]> it's already there
22:33:11 <vdge[m]> Yep, read your previous message about that saying only device managers are allowed to do it. right ?
22:33:41 <strcat[m]> vdge: a device policy manager can do it (I should start being clearer about that terminology) and can enable the button
22:33:51 <strcat[m]>  * vdge: a device policy manager can do it via an API (I should start being clearer about that terminology) and can enable the button
22:33:56 <strcat[m]>  * vdge: a device policy manager can do it via an API (I should start being clearer about that terminology) and can also enable the button
22:34:01 <strcat[m]> all we do is enable the button by default
22:34:43 <Thatcher[m]> This is awesome stuff to learn about. Time for me to switch to secondary user as my main.
22:35:06 <strcat[m]> just 1 thing to keep in mind: Seedvault only supports the owner profile atm, sadly
22:36:41 <vdge[m]> and also developer options I suppose if anyone needs that
22:38:07 <TheJollyRoger> @ anupritaisno1[m] @clannad, can you register the nicknames for GrapheneOS-Teleg and such?
22:38:17 <TheJollyRoger> I can set the channel flags for them.
22:38:27 <strcat[m]> vdge: those are generally global options though, you can still use the Owner profile to configure stuff
22:38:32 <strcat[m]> vdge: not really comparable
22:38:40 <strcat[m]> you always have to use the Owner profile to configure global stuff
22:38:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It's very nice that we have this option to separate apps we may like to use, but do not trust to have access to eg: Contacts or files, to put them in a separate profile
22:38:57 <strcat[m]> other than specific things where the active profile is allowed to configure it (generally network stuff)
22:39:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Or even if we do trust them but just don't think it's their business
22:39:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> They should already be registered
22:39:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, hang on a sec.
22:40:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger
22:41:15 <jalb> strcat[m]: what I'm afraid if that secondary profiles will experiment some failures from time to time and using one of them as the main profile
22:41:42 <jalb> *if secondary profiles
22:42:05 <strcat[m]> jalb: the issue I was mentioning isn't really specific to secondary profiles
22:42:14 <strcat[m]> it occurs when switching between profiles including the owner one
22:42:24 <TheJollyRoger> @clannad, looks like the Freenode staff are coming to help! Whew.
22:42:32 <jalb> oh ok strcat[m]
22:43:06 <jalb> I don't use seedvault, so it's great to do this
22:43:19 <jalb> I'll do it asap
22:43:37 <jess> hello
22:43:47 <jess> did someone say: freenode staff
22:43:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
22:44:18 <jess> oh nicole is on it
22:44:19 <jess> lovely
22:44:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hi jess, yeah, I'm just talking to nicole so that we can set the GrapheneOS-Teleg bot so that Sigyn doesn't kline it when there's
22:44:26 <TheJollyRoger> a lot of activity on the other side.
22:44:26 <jess> aint she nice
22:44:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:44:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
22:45:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I think what happened was that I put it in +v mode but then the connection went out so it lost the +v, so I'll set it for a flag and then hopefully this should fix it.
22:45:15 <TheJollyRoger> *hopefully this fix from Nicole should fix it.
22:45:44 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: / @clannad will the bots always connect from the same IP address?
22:45:46 <jalb> great talk, thank you, bye
22:46:37 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "vdge: those are generally global"> Ahhh, tried to configure a remote phone using USB debugging(scrcpy) but it didn't work across profiles.
22:47:47 <strcat[m]> we're likely to disable network-based adb in production (`user`) builds anyway
22:50:46 <TheJollyRoger> Must have left his desk.
22:54:23 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Oof.  Could make life harder on the developer who wants to target and debug for the 2 users on the planet who play their unity game on GrapheneOS. :)
22:55:50 <strcat[m]> I don't see how it's relevant
22:56:00 <strcat[m]> think you're misunderstanding how that feature is meant to be used and the serious downsides of it
22:56:09 <strcat[m]> which is part of the problem and why it needs to be disabled in production builds
22:56:11 <strcat[m]> it's dangerous
22:58:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> Yes
22:58:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> Same ipv6 address
22:58:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger
22:58:54 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: ok!
22:59:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> 2a03:a140:10:7c2::1
23:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: nicole added those IP addresses to a "Sigyn exempt list"
23:00:08 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
23:00:21 <TheJollyRoger> Should be fixed!
23:12:20 <noustfurkuphater> with no permission other than network while running in a work profile, does graphene contain a program I want to install but cannot trust?
23:12:36 <noustfurkuphater> as in well enough
23:14:52 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: don't use work profiles. Use separate user profiles.
23:15:25 <TheJollyRoger> Data in a work profile is owned by the service managing the work profile. If you use shelter, that means a third-party app gets to control that data.
23:15:58 <noustfurkuphater> running an entire different user profile seems unproductive
23:16:04 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Peter-Easton/3af0af2d1c4c2eca24a9e324e0a22145/raw/80ce39ed46897fa328e3fcb983e133b1ed3d922f/NSA%2520Social%2520&%2520AndroMail Maybe this may help explain things.
23:16:06 <noustfurkuphater> I need to sign out of current then don't I?
23:16:17 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: just switch between them.
23:16:32 <noustfurkuphater> <TheJollyRoger "noustfurkuphater: just switch be"> yes but how fluid is it?
23:16:57 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: as fluid as entering your password, and/or using your biometrics identification for biometrics unlock.
23:17:09 <noustfurkuphater> I want to eg message a friend on molly and then check on the other program and back under eg 10 sec
23:17:24 <noustfurkuphater> <TheJollyRoger "noustfurkuphater: as fluid as en"> that seems okay
23:18:00 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: we discourage the use of Work Profiles as managed by third party apps like Shelter or Island. The work profile functionality in Android is intended to be owned and managed by the organization administrating the work profile.
23:18:03 <TheJollyRoger> Meaning
23:18:04 <TheJollyRoger> IT
23:18:06 <TheJollyRoger> IS
23:18:08 <TheJollyRoger> NOT
23:18:10 <TheJollyRoger> YOURS.
23:18:24 <TheJollyRoger> So it's much better to simply use a secondary profile, it's a little bit of extra load,
23:18:38 <TheJollyRoger> extra load, to be switching back and forth using your finger to tap on the different name,
23:18:50 <noustfurkuphater> extra load?
23:18:58 <noustfurkuphater> Can my phone really take that?
23:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> extra mental load.
23:19:13 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone can take it no problem, the question is, are you willing to tap on "switch users"?
23:19:36 <TheJollyRoger> If you are, then that's a much, much, much safer way to manage different contextual identities and isolate apps you don't feel are entirely trustworthy.
23:19:42 <noustfurkuphater> I already get incredibly poor performance from my OS with freezing and if I look at htop on termux, I am nearly always maxed on memory when I've opened literally no program
23:20:05 <noustfurkuphater> <TheJollyRoger "Your phone can take it no proble"> doesn't sound bad
23:20:18 <noustfurkuphater> how heavy will this be on memory usage though
23:20:20 <TheJollyRoger> That's because htop on termux is not doing what you think it's doing. Your phone is cutting termux's performance to save battery.
23:20:29 <noustfurkuphater> <noustfurkuphater "how heavy will this be on memory"> that is critical to my decision
23:20:39 <noustfurkuphater> <TheJollyRoger "That's because htop on termux is"> oh
23:20:51 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: not very. If you want, you can simply hit "end session" from the lockscreen and that causes the secondary profile to be frozen.
23:20:59 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: the OS is supposed to fully use all memory on the phone
23:21:04 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: that's the normal state of things
23:21:10 <noustfurkuphater> why is that?
23:21:12 <TheJollyRoger> It will eject the cryptographic keys from memory, and close all processes that user opened.
23:21:24 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: it's supposed to use all memory, that's just how it works, dunno what you're confused about
23:21:42 <strcat[m]> why have the memory to just not use it?
23:21:44 <TheJollyRoger> noustfurkuphater: precaching. Remember, a phone operating system isn't a desktop. It doesn't work the same way as a desktop.
23:21:54 <TheJollyRoger> Memory that's not in use, is memory that's being /wasted./
23:22:05 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "noustfurkuphater: it's supposed "> because it just seems like android is far too heavy as I get constant freezes and lag (not just in opening of apps)
23:22:10 <strcat[m]> a desktop doesn't really work that much differently but doesn't try to cache applications
23:22:16 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: it's not
23:22:20 <strcat[m]> and you're not running GrapheneOS
23:22:26 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "why have the memory to just not "> use to when you need. Why use all cosntantly?
23:22:30 <strcat[m]> and you just seem like another concern troll or the same person from earlier
23:22:45 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: because it's there and meant to be used
23:22:47 <noustfurkuphater> <TheJollyRoger "Memory that's not in use, is mem"> why is that?
23:23:02 <strcat[m]> if you're not running GrapheneOS you're in the wrong channel
23:23:08 <strcat[m]> this channel is for GrapheneOS
23:23:13 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "and you're not running GrapheneO"> what? I am.
23:23:22 <strcat[m]> you implied you weren't
23:23:49 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "if you're not running GrapheneOS"> I said I am
23:23:51 <strcat[m]> so, first of all, the design of AOSP is that it caches apps in the background
23:23:56 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "you implied you weren't"> where?
23:24:01 <strcat[m]> and the design of the Linux kernel is that it uses all available memory
23:24:08 <strcat[m]> although not proactively
23:24:22 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "so, first of all, the design of "> I mean fresh from a reboot?
23:24:26 <strcat[m]> yes
23:24:38 <strcat[m]> you can't judge anything based on the used memory you have to look at how it's used
23:24:44 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to use it
23:24:46 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "and the design of the Linux kern"> I don't see that on arch
23:24:52 <strcat[m]> yeah you do
23:24:56 <strcat[m]> as I said just not proactively
23:25:01 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "you can't judge anything based o"> how can I look at that?
23:25:04 <strcat[m]> without running some thing to do readahead
23:25:12 <noustfurkuphater> How can I monitor what is causing poor performance?
23:25:32 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "as I said just not proactively"> hmm uhhh I don't understand
23:25:48 <strcat[m]> yes, clearly you don't
23:26:01 <noustfurkuphater> may you explain?
23:26:08 <strcat[m]> I did above
23:26:46 <strcat[m]> it's also intended that GrapheneOS will use ~120M more per app
23:26:49 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "and the design of the Linux kern"> why
23:26:51 <strcat[m]> for hardened_malloc quarantine
23:27:00 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: because the memory is supposed to be used
23:27:02 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "it's also intended that Graphene"> wow!
23:27:04 <strcat[m]> it is there, why wouldn't it be used?
23:27:32 <strcat[m]> the kernel caches pages
23:27:38 <strcat[m]> it will purposely use all available memory
23:27:42 <strcat[m]> once it has read enough stuff to cache
23:27:49 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "it is there, why wouldn't it be "> well what is it being used by? Fresh reboot and I still get poor performance. Phone I am using is second hand but still.
23:27:51 <exquisitehalo> http://kod6ulul5meacjnnnjvlcrqalkeprqy6mybha3vcwsxj7p7ia6w66uid.onion/
23:28:08 <noustfurkuphater> ooh a onion
23:28:11 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: I don't know why you're making the assumption that whatever issues you're having are caused by memory usage
23:28:41 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "noustfurkuphater: I don't know w"> I saw htop in termux but I guess that isn't accurate
23:28:49 <noustfurkuphater> then where can I find out?
23:29:22 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: the memory is supposed to be used
23:29:27 <strcat> it's not an indication of anything wrong
23:29:31 <strcat> so, move on from that
23:29:47 <noustfurkuphater> yes okay but what system monitor can I look at then?
23:30:00 <noustfurkuphater> I want to understand what is causing poor performance.
23:30:04 <strcat> and I suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/features and https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc if you want to understand why GrapheneOS uses ~120M per app extra
23:30:07 <strcat> which is on purpose
23:30:17 <strcat> it intentionally has a quarantine for memory allocations
23:30:27 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: you'll need to clarify what about performance is poor and what exactly is going wrong
23:30:45 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: it sounds like you might have an issue like failing storage where the OS repeatedly fails to write to it due to I/O errors
23:30:46 <strcat> and stalls
23:31:03 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: I recommend taking a bug report capture
23:31:06 <strcat> after it starts happening
23:31:09 <strcat> and investigating it through that
23:31:15 <strcat> use the bug report capture tool in developer options
23:31:29 <strcat> there are other tools there you can use but that's the best way
23:31:51 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "noustfurkuphater: you'll need to"> So fresh reboot and I open say fluffy chat. It will obviously start and I will message various people and then my touch input stops and my android system freezes up forcing me to do a hard reboot or will recover and do all my touch inputs very quickly after
23:31:58 <noustfurkuphater> not just that app
23:32:09 <strcat> that's very abnormal and I don't know why you're blaming Android
23:32:19 <noustfurkuphater> happens in newpipe, molly, anything
23:32:21 <strcat> or claiming it's overly heavy, etc.
23:32:39 <strcat> first of all you're running GrapheneOS
23:32:41 <strcat> not Android
23:32:51 <strcat> and that's not a normal behavior on GrapheneOS or something we hear about people having often
23:33:09 <strcat> so there's a pretty good chance you have a more serious problem than you realize like storage hardware failure
23:33:19 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "that's very abnormal and I don't"> I am? I didn't mean that. Either poor hardware or android being heavy. I just want to understand the bottleneck or what magical background process.
23:33:23 <strcat> you should capture a bug report with that tool and look through the massive amount of data it provides
23:33:39 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: you're just doing it again
23:33:48 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: that's obviously not how the device/OS normally behaves
23:33:51 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "not Android"> I mean... come on. AOSP. It has android in the name and graphene is based on it.
23:33:52 <strcat> other people aren't experiencing that
23:33:54 <strcat> you get that, right?
23:34:04 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "and that's not a normal behavior"> oh well it's happening for me
23:34:12 <strcat> yeah, it's happening for you, and not others
23:34:18 <strcat> so what about your setup / device is different than others?
23:34:22 <strcat> that is what you have to figure out
23:34:31 <strcat> so I'm recommending you use the bug report capture tool in dev options
23:34:36 <strcat> it also has other tools you might find useful
23:34:44 <strcat> but a bug report gives you a *massive* amount of data already
23:34:48 <strcat> far more than you actually want
23:35:18 <strcat> there's also a tool there showing average and max memory usage by apps
23:35:30 <strcat> and bear in mind GrapheneOS massively increases that for hardened_malloc intentionally
23:35:40 <strcat> it's possible to use hardened_malloc without a memory usage increase
23:35:48 <strcat> in fact it's actually very lightweight if configured that way
23:36:07 <strcat> but we use it in a very hardened configuration where there are quite large quarantines to help mitigate vulnerabilities
23:36:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Does not matter since you need to hook up the computer to the phone first to get it working.
23:36:27 <noustfurkuphater> is the bug report creator published to a web server or stay to my phone? If it does upload, to what level of information?
23:36:36 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: doesn't upload anything
23:36:48 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: it captures a bug report and then has you send it somewhere via an email app or other app
23:36:52 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "noustfurkuphater: doesn't upload"> oh ok that sounds good
23:37:16 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "noustfurkuphater: it captures a "> oh. Can't I just save it as a file on my phone to read with a text editor?
23:38:04 <strcat> noustfurkuphater: it's a lot more data than you're going to want to dig through on a phone screen
23:39:06 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat "noustfurkuphater: it's a lot mor"> oh olay
23:39:12 <noustfurkuphater> well I think I just took one
23:39:17 <noustfurkuphater> where is it exactly?
23:39:41 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: it shows a notification
23:39:46 <noustfurkuphater> did in developer options with full
23:39:46 <strcat[m]> when it's done it gives a prompt to give it to an app
23:39:53 <strcat[m]> look at the notification
23:39:55 <noustfurkuphater> <strcat[m] "noustfurkuphater: it shows a not"> I don't see a notification
23:39:56 <strcat[m]> if it's done it will say so
23:40:02 <strcat[m]> then you didn't do it
23:40:12 <noustfurkuphater> huh wait lemme try again
23:40:24 <strcat[m]> you need to have an app that's willing to accept the file
23:40:29 <strcat[m]> an email client will work
23:40:37 <strcat[m]> it makes you choose an app
23:40:38 <strcat[m]> to give it to
23:40:52 <strcat[m]> when it's done and you click on it
23:41:09 <noustfurkuphater> I've done it!
23:41:21 <noustfurkuphater> I'll read through tomorrow morning
23:41:30 <strcat[m]> also you can see there's a way to view app memory usage there
23:41:48 <noustfurkuphater> it's a little bit... large
23:41:52 <noustfurkuphater> almost 9MB
23:42:00 <noustfurkuphater> a lot more than I expected
23:42:04 <strcat[m]> yes it's a huge amount of data
23:42:13 <strcat[m]> it gives you a huge amount of hardware diagnostics
23:42:22 <strcat[m]> and it gives you summaries of all recent crash dumps
23:42:35 <strcat[m]> so any recent apps, processes, etc. that crashed you have summaries of the crash dumps
23:42:49 <strcat[m]> and it gives you a bunch of logs from current boot
23:43:05 <strcat[m]> it's basically anything that could possibly be obtained to help with debugging arbitrary stuff
23:43:12 <noustfurkuphater> Well I did have a freeze up again while typing a few minutes before taking the report so it should show something useful
23:43:29 <noustfurkuphater> yay epic
23:43:34 <strcat[m]> which device is it?
23:43:44 <noustfurkuphater> 4
23:43:54 <strcat[m]> it really sounds like a hardware problem
23:44:02 <noustfurkuphater> darn
23:44:05 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 4 has way more memory, etc. than really needed / used in practice
23:44:15 <strcat[m]> even with hardened_malloc
23:44:15 <noustfurkuphater> well that's the cost I pay of grtting it second hand
23:44:32 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: it's possible a factory reset could fix it but check out the logs first
23:44:34 <strcat[m]> unclear what is wrong
23:44:37 <strcat[m]> it sounds like I/O errors to me
23:44:45 <strcat[m]> noustfurkuphater: like it is trying to read a block off storage
23:44:46 <strcat[m]> failing
23:44:55 <strcat[m]> and repeatedly trying to read over and over getting I/O errors
23:44:55 <noustfurkuphater> I will read
23:44:59 <strcat[m]> that's one possibility
23:45:20 <strcat[m]> really hard to know what is wrong without looking through that tho
23:45:26 <noustfurkuphater> anyways I can generally live with the crashes and freezes but sometimes it is just very much a problem like a phone call drop
23:45:36 <noustfurkuphater> phone completely froze up that time so I hard reboot
23:45:42 <strcat[m]> there was 1 other person who reported something similar
23:45:43 <strcat[m]> in recent past
23:45:47 <strcat[m]> but it's just 1 other persobn
23:45:50 <strcat[m]>  * but it's just 1 other person
23:45:53 <strcat[m]> not a normal thing
23:46:00 <strcat[m]> it's hard to know what the cause could be
23:46:40 <strcat[m]> we do certainly increase memory usage substantially per app but I don't think it has anything to do with memory usage, and there's no 'swap' as you seemed to think
23:46:55 <strcat[m]> when it starts to run out of memory it starts killing cached apps
23:47:07 <strcat[m]> it caches apps in case you're going to use them soon
23:47:10 <strcat[m]> just what AOSP does
23:47:22 <strcat[m]> caching them as in they are spawned but asleep
23:47:34 <strcat[m]> it has a ton of easily available memory from killing them
23:47:51 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use all memory for that since it allows the kernel to have a bunch for caching other stuff
23:48:12 <noustfurkuphater> okay well goodbye and thank you for the aid
23:48:15 <strcat[m]> we do increase memory usage per-app but we also have way fewer apps than stock OS
23:48:19 <noustfurkuphater> :-)
23:49:37 <Lestat[m]> my workstation is quad core i5-4960k, ssid, 8gb ram
23:49:47 <Lestat[m]> How long would u say gos would take to compile
23:49:51 <Lestat[m]> roughly ofc
23:50:26 <goblinslayer[m]> <Lotus[m] "you can use etesync for syncing "> protoncalander is also in beta access atm
23:53:49 <strcat[m]> Lestat: 8GB ram not really enough and not nearly enough to compile the Linux kernel with LTO
23:54:04 <strcat[m]> Lestat: so maybe you could build the OS using the prebuilts but you couldn't build the kernel
23:54:08 <Lestat[m]> im waiting for my 16gb
23:54:11 <strcat[m]> also it'd take ages, that's a really bad CPU for doing it
23:54:16 <strcat[m]> would not be practical
23:54:19 <Lestat[m]> Ah damn
23:54:26 <Lestat[m]> Well thats that
23:54:27 <strcat[m]> you could build it
23:54:33 <strcat[m]> it would take probably 6 hours
23:54:35 <Lestat[m]> Im gonna go cry now cuz i cant contribute
23:54:44 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "it would take probably 6 hours"> Oh thats fine
23:54:45 <strcat[m]> you don't need to be able to build the OS efficiently to contribute
23:54:52 <Lestat[m]> I thought we were talking longer
23:54:59 <strcat[m]> Lestat: well it'll take probably 6 hours for initial build then maybe 3 minutes for small incremental builds
23:55:04 <strcat[m]> Lestat: on a CPU that bad
23:55:28 <strcat[m]> Lestat: so you'd have a really bad experience doing anything that required doing clean builds, or doing incremental builds requiring rebuilding a lot of code
23:55:29 <Lestat[m]> i bought it a while ago for gaming and it was plenty lol dont cpu shame me
23:55:37 <Lestat[m]> Anyways 6 hours is fine
23:55:51 <strcat[m]> Lestat: so basically you could sync stable release, work with that
23:56:01 <strcat[m]> and then each new stable release should probably clear out/ and make a clean build to start from again
23:56:08 <strcat[m]> so 6 hours waste each stable release
23:56:14 <strcat[m]>  * so 6 hours wasted each stable release
23:56:15 <madaidan[m]> It takes me 8 hours to compile the Linux kernel alone
23:56:19 <strcat[m]> Lestat: it's just not very practical
23:56:27 <madaidan[m]> Unless I'm using a really stripped down config
23:56:31 <Lestat[m]> Danny told me to try to contribute to gos....
23:56:34 <Lestat[m]> Thats why i asked
23:56:42 <strcat[m]> Lestat: well you can build it
23:56:47 <strcat[m]> just explaining it's going to be a rough experience
23:57:00 <strcat[m]> Lestat: you can contribute in areas that don't require building the whole OS
23:57:10 <strcat[m]> you could contribute to OS dev itself if you really wanted
23:57:16 <strcat[m]> and can tolerate how awful it's going to be on that hardware
23:57:44 <strcat[m]> I'm about to make a new workstation because this trash one from 2016 is no good anymore
23:57:47 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "you could contribute to OS dev i"> This maybe in the future :D im not a decent C dev rn...im still studying C.
23:57:54 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "and can tolerate how awful it's "> This i can do tho
23:57:59 <strcat[m]> 10 core / 20 thread CPU @ 5GHz, 64GB DDR4, 2TB NVMe SSD
23:58:00 <strcat[m]> no good
23:58:06 <HowardR> Is this what my development (11) build for Pixel5/redfin should look like?¬† https://imgur.com/1FuiSXI.jpg
23:58:31 <Lestat[m]> I have multiple machines so 1 machine going for 6 hours aint a worry for me
23:58:40 <Lestat[m]> It aint gonna stop my productivity
23:58:46 <strcat[m]> HowardR: if you're going to be testing in the emulator you should just use x86_64 generic builds
23:58:57 <strcat[m]> HowardR: not sure what exactly  you're asking
23:59:21 <strcat[m]> Lestat: yeah I just mean it's a lot nice when a clean build takes 20 mins and an incremental build takes 30 seconds
23:59:34 <strcat[m]> Lestat: as opposed to 6 hours and say, 3-4 minutes for incremental
23:59:43 <strcat[m]>  * Lestat: yeah I just mean it's a lot nicer when a clean build takes 20 mins and an incremental build takes 30 seconds
