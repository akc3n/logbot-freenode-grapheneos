03:23:44 <BobBraxboi[m]> <JohnMayer "Graphene on the Pixel is fantast"> I don’t think there’s any laptop counterpart for Graphene. If you’re just looking for something that’s relatively free and secure, you can look into Qubes.
03:25:44 <JohnMayer> Is there hardware that offers anything similar to the secure boot of the pixel, that could run chrome os?
03:26:12 <gofigga[m]> This is probably a discussion for #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:26:26 <JohnMayer> OK
03:36:00 <bauershades[m]> Is it possible to back up with a full encryited usb (veracrypt)?

04:10:31 <krocker[m]> I am very excited to install Graphene on Pixel 5, but when I try to unlock bootloader, I repeatedly receive message "Error: access denied". I have allowed OEM unlocking. Does anybody have any tips for me?
04:10:31 <strcat[m]> it does encrypted backups itself
04:10:31 <strcat[m]> krocker: sounds like you're on a desktop Linux distribution and missed https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-as-non-root

04:58:29 <Guest94534> Ahoy.
04:59:20 <sjsndnjdejd> yo
04:59:46 <Guest94534> When I attempt to install GrapheneOS to my Pixel using the webinstaller it gives me the following error when I attempt to flash the release: "Error: Failed to construct 'Worker': Access to the script at 'https://grapheneos.org/js/fastboot/dist/vendor/z-worker-pako.js' is denied by the document's Content Security Policy."
05:05:45 * sjsndnjdejd sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/siMMyaczugJwaPEJuaJhuvov/message.txt >
05:06:14 <sjsndnjdejd> if you installed the pkg you should related udev rules under /lib/udev/rules.d/
05:06:34 <strcat[m]> not seeing any reason there would be a CSP error with the web installer
05:06:44 <strcat[m]> unless someone has a really messed up browser extension screwing with HTTP headers
05:06:49 <strcat[m]> which some browsers extensions do like doing
05:07:19 <sjsndnjdejd> * if you have installed the pkg correctly you should see related udev rules under /lib/udev/rules.d/
05:07:45 <Supriem> I did not download any packages before attempting to install GrapheneOS.
05:08:27 <Supriem> I also just downloaded Chrome because it listed it as an official browser, so I have no extensions.
05:08:56 <strcat[m]> Supriem: you're at https://grapheneos.org/install/web right?
05:09:02 <Supriem> Yes.
05:09:09 <strcat[m]> can you open the web console
05:09:14 <strcat[m]> and then start the flashing process
05:10:23 <Supriem> I can unlock the bootloader and download the release, but I cannot flash the release.
05:10:36 <strcat[m]> open web console so there's more of a log
05:11:30 <Supriem> Alright
05:11:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> You can check if you have weird extensions installed by default in browser settings btw
05:12:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Some programs like to auto inject extensions
05:13:20 <strcat[m]> Supriem: what's logged there? with some more context
05:15:53 <strcat[m]> and which version of the browser?
05:17:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> He just installed chrome and chrome always gets the latest version so...
05:17:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Btw why install chrome when edge is basically the same thing
05:18:04 <strcat[m]> it's not clear to me how they would get a CSP error others don't get
05:18:09 <strcat[m]> if they just installed the standard Chrome
05:18:19 <strcat[m]> so, waiting for more information right now, no point speculating
05:18:21 <Supriem> codec-pool.js:117 Refused to create a worker from 'https://grapheneos.org/js/fastboot/dist/vendor/z-worker-pako.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "child-src https://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com wss://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com". Note that 'worker-src' was not explicitly set, so 'child-src' is used as
05:18:21 <Supriem> a fallback.
05:18:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Yep
05:18:38 <strcat[m]> Supriem: you have security software doing TLS interception
05:18:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Antivirus breaking stuff
05:18:40 <strcat[m]> and breaking the site
05:18:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Unsurprising
05:18:54 <strcat[m]> Supriem: it's injecting something into the browser changing things
05:19:20 <strcat[m]> and I guess they did it wrong
05:19:30 <Supriem> What's the best way to end its interrupting methods?
05:19:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Uninstall it
05:19:47 <strcat[m]> Supriem: maybe you can disable the TLS interception feature of kaspersky?
05:19:52 <strcat[m]> Supriem: I assume you can just disable it
05:20:54 <strcat[m]> Supriem: https://superuser.com/questions/981959/how-to-disable-kaspersky-antivirus-javascript-injection
05:21:36 <strcat[m]> Supriem: well, anyway, you know what the problem is now: AV software messing with the browser by injecting code and intercepting TLS connections
05:21:39 <strcat[m]> to modify the site
05:21:59 <Supriem> Yes. Thank you.

05:24:05 <strcat[m]> rny: nah it's a yubikey
05:24:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Thanks I'll use that token to bypass 2fa
05:24:10 <rny> lol
05:24:13 <strcat[m]> if you push the button it spews out those one time password things
05:24:19 <strcat[m]> ccccccrtuvlntugfligficrhnheuugbfrlevenegdvrr
05:24:26 <strcat[m]> and it ends it with <enter>
05:24:40 <strcat[m]> did it by accident
05:24:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> I actually use those lol
05:24:48 <rny> whats the common prefix
05:24:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> ccccc
05:25:16 <strcat[m]> rny: https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/OTPs_Explained.html
05:25:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Your yubikey has an internal counter for these codes btw
05:25:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> So if you disclose the code by accident
05:25:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Log in with the key and increment that counter
05:25:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> For the server
05:26:02 <strcat[m]> I don't use that anyway
05:26:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Then the old OTP will be rejected
05:26:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> It's pretty useful imo
05:26:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Because google wants to close fido u2f and couple it with gms
05:27:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> This stuff just works
05:27:12 <strcat[m]> I only have the YubiKey as an easy backup
05:27:15 <strcat[m]> it's not quite the same
05:27:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> You can use the yubikey personalization tool to disable it btw
05:27:40 <strcat[m]> they only did it in Play services because it was the way to bring it to pre-APEX Android
05:27:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> There's also different triggers for long and short taps
05:28:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> So you can move OTP generation to a longer tap
05:28:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> And also disable stuff like GPG, OTP, etc for NFC
05:29:47 <rny> funnily re: my mail server the only client bothered enough to use TLS1.3 and a different cipher is also the fkin spammer that's brute forcing my password
05:30:06 <rny> same for mail.grapheneos.org?
05:31:03 <strcat[m]> lots of other mail servers use TLSv1.3 for me
05:31:17 <rny> and google uses it too
05:31:42 <rny> not many TLS1.3 patrons for me
05:32:08 <rny> never seen anyone TLS negotiate with chacha
05:32:12 <rny> so sad
05:32:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <rny "never seen anyone TLS negotiate "> Glassrom did
05:32:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> We used to prefer chacha20 first in the past
05:33:16 <rny> glassrom never send me love letters
05:33:20 <rny> :(
05:33:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> But we are also not very good people about it
05:33:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> The moment TLS 1.3 became a spec
05:33:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> We dropped TLS 1.2
05:34:05 <rny> has all clients even adopted tlsv1.3?
05:34:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> And ignored TLS 1.2 users, forcing them to upgrade browsers
05:34:11 <rny> lol
05:34:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> We didn't care lol
05:34:25 <rny> 👏
05:34:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Glassrom is not primarily concerned about the user
05:36:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> If necessary we'll throw away backwards compatibility for security, even if it means kicking out 99% of the user base
05:36:49 <rny> anyone knocked on your server with DES-CBC3-SHA?
05:36:53 <rny> :P
05:37:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> This was never supported
05:37:25 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: nice disabled it
05:37:28 <strcat[m]> no more spewing stuff
05:37:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> TLS 1.2 with AEAD only
05:37:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Was the bare minimum
05:38:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> I did enable 0rtt at first
05:38:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Disabled it later
05:38:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> I thought it'd be fine because I wasn't handling login data
05:39:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it's just a terrible idea overall
05:39:39 <strcat[m]> rny: you can set it so chacha will be used
05:39:49 <strcat[m]> if for some reason you want it
05:39:52 <strcat[m]> it's slower than hardware AES
05:39:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: really don't recommend it btw
05:40:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> For some reason pushing chacha first breaks a lot of stuff
05:40:20 <strcat[m]> rny: in postfix set `tls_preempt_cipherlist = yes` and just order ChaCha20 first
05:40:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it shouldn't break anything
05:40:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> It did though, lol
05:40:54 <rny> i read some stupid clients will break
05:41:23 <rny> but that's with tls_preempt_cipherlist set to yes anyways
05:41:37 <strcat[m]> rny: if you have `tls_preempt_cipherlist = yes` WITHOUT having ChaCha20 first then nothing will ever use it without both sides having BoringSSL with client not supporting hardware AES
05:41:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <rny "i read some stupid clients will "> I guess chrome is chad then
05:42:27 <rny> huh? chrome broke with server preferred cipher list?
05:42:34 <rny> thats quite bizarre
05:42:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Breaks stupid clients by putting a nonexistent cipher TLS_GREASE
05:42:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <rny "huh? chrome broke with server pr"> No, chrome breaks the server
05:42:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: TLS grease has nothing to do with having ChaCha
05:42:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's the other way around
05:42:57 <strcat[m]> and it's a standard thing that's required
05:43:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: TLS grease has no"> Aware, just sarcasm
05:43:31 <rny> anyways, i was just amused
05:43:38 <rny> nobody bothers to use chacha20
05:44:07 <rny> when CF has been shilling it on their blog non-stop
05:44:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Except wireguard
05:44:18 <rny> better mobile performance!
05:44:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Honestly I want someone to show me real world diff
05:44:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm on gigabit with wireguard rn
05:44:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> No performance impact
05:45:10 <rny> anupritaisno1[m]:
05:45:18 <rny> there is performance
05:45:18 <rny> https://blog.cloudflare.com/do-the-chacha-better-mobile-performance-with-cryptography/
05:45:18 <rny> AES-128-GCM:   41.6ms
05:45:18 <rny> ChaCha20-Poly1305:  13.2ms
05:45:18 <rny> For example: decrypting a 1MB file on the Galaxy Nexus (OMAP 4460 chip):
05:45:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> If anybody wants to flex how they can encrypt 100gb in a second using AESNI
05:45:38 <rny> cherry-picked a broken chip :/
05:45:43 <strcat[m]> rny: that's on hardware without hardware AES
05:45:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Afaik the fastest ssd is 5GBps
05:45:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> So yeah gg
05:46:25 <strcat[m]> rny: arm64 has standard CPU AES/SHA instructions as an extension supported by Snapdragon, Exynos and anything else that matters
05:46:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just use chacha20, be happy
05:46:52 <strcat[m]> and then they also have the Crypto Engine for offloading it to a secondary processor specialized at doing it in bulk
05:47:01 <strcat[m]> and disk encryption is now inline encryption
05:47:07 <strcat[m]> happens as part of the storage controller
05:47:19 <strcat[m]> so it's zero overhead, essentially
05:47:33 <rny> hw-accelerated AES ops would use less power?
05:47:34 <strcat[m]> since it has inline decryption of the blocks
05:47:42 <strcat[m]> rny: it's way faster
05:47:44 <rny> i noticed with WG VPN turned on, my battery drains like mad
05:47:51 <strcat[m]> rny: and yes more efficient
05:48:15 <strcat[m]> rny: most efficient would be kernel ipsec with AES since it's hardware accelerated
05:48:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Screw chacha20 imma implement AES in under an hour
05:48:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh no, why are there cryptographers outside my door with guns
05:48:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> /s
05:49:13 <strcat[m]> rny: on a more powerful CPU it doesn't matter as much
05:49:58 <strcat[m]> rny: I get much less spam now that I don't accept unencrypted connections
05:50:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: how secure is poly1305 exactly?
05:50:30 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: AES128
05:50:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Documentation says that to break AES-POLY1305 you must break AES itself
05:51:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I couldn't find a technical explanation of how poly1305 works on wikipedias
05:51:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> * But I couldn't find a technical explanation of how poly1305 works on wikipedias article
05:51:19 <strcat[m]> that's not the poly1305 that's in ChaCha20 in TLS though
05:51:19 <strcat[m]> iirc
05:51:23 <strcat[m]>  * that's not the poly1305 that's for ChaCha20 in TLS though
05:51:26 <rny> why not read bernstein's webpage?
05:51:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh, he has one
05:51:46 <rny> https://cr.yp.to/mac.html
05:52:17 <rny> why dont all cryptographers write like this
05:52:28 <rny> so much more accessible
05:52:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: when will WiFi implement chacha20 though
05:52:38 <strcat[m]> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539#section-2.6
05:52:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll literally be an early adopter
05:53:32 <rny> looks simpler than DES
05:53:34 <rny> lol
05:54:22 <strcat[m]> the Poly1305 in the TLS cipher uses ChaCha20 for that
05:54:23 <strcat[m]> not AES
05:57:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <U​_can_call_me_k> Is bitrot possible with verified boot?
05:57:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> K: no not really
05:58:59 <strcat[m]> verified boot verifies that all firmware and and OS images are bit-for-bit identical to what they are supposed to be
05:59:04 <strcat[m]> with cryptographically secure verification
05:59:24 <strcat[m]> for the large portions of it, if verification of a block fails, it tries fixing it with parity data and verifying again
05:59:42 <strcat[m]> it's not particularly useful on devices with a proper SSD with good error correction algorithms
06:16:19 <strcat[m]> btw I could probably fix that Kaspersky issue by setting a no-op `child-src 'self'` and then they'd probably understand to preserve that
06:16:23 <strcat[m]> the issue is that they don't understand CSP
06:16:42 <strcat[m]> they're making a `child-src 'self'` policy without considering that when not present it falls back to `script-src` and then `default-src`
07:54:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: how is a local root CA even secure?
07:54:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like I'm pretty sure it's not even stored on an HSM
07:55:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> So malware is also free to steal the cert and mitm pages
07:55:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like wtf
07:55:14 <strcat[m]> they're public keys
07:55:17 <strcat[m]> not private keys
07:55:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh
07:55:53 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: oh you mean the AV? well, on Android, it *could* use the keystore
07:55:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I thought you just meant adding a root
07:56:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> On windows not really
07:56:06 <strcat[m]> the root store only has public keys
07:56:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> The root cert privkey is definitely stored in a well known path
07:56:33 <strcat[m]> don't want to think about it any more
07:56:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the root store is pubkeys
07:56:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> For the AV
07:56:49 <strcat[m]> yeah but that's not about the root store
07:56:53 <strcat[m]> anyway off-topic now

13:09:54 <wafflez1> Hey. First time here. What's the fuss with nicknames ending with "[m]"?
13:13:25 <xx> I think it means matrix.org clients
13:13:43 <xx> but thats for #grapheneos-offtopic
13:16:18 <wafflez1> Anyway, I'm here because I use GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3a. To this day I did have "spotify downloader" installed on my phone, uninstalled it few minutes ago because somehow I just don't trust this app. I deleted all storage cache and application configuration before removing the app itself. Any other steps that I can do to make sure that it did not do some nasty things with the OS itself, or there is
13:16:24 <wafflez1> nothing to worry about?
13:17:29 <wafflez1> xx: thank you, makes sense. I thought it stands for "mobile". I need to start using matrix also. Sorry for offtopic.
13:22:02 <smctwo> is it possible to add both fbe and fde if yes how?
13:22:52 <robb1e_rotten> hey
13:24:57 <robb1e_rotten> is grapheneOS vulnerable to cellebrite UFED or other softwares like this?
13:28:36 <bauershades[m]> <robb1e_rotten "is grapheneOS vulnerable to cell"> Would like to know as well if their are any cases of a seized phone running GrapheneOS by law enforcement
13:39:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> If you can see this channels history or use its search functin for the term UFED, this question has been discussed yesterday evening in detail.
14:21:54 <maestro11> I am confused by the removal of the calendar  app icon in the launcher?
14:26:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> I think it says in the release notes, that the icon was removed to actually avoid confusion, because the calendar app included in the OS is only a non-functional stub, not providing any calendar functionality, but included to that other apps that require some kind of calendar don't crash. You are supposed to install any calendar you like to use yourself.
14:27:42 <maestro11> Ah, nice. That's not exactly what the release note says but I will take your assumptions as correct. :)
14:28:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> Probably due to my incomplete understanding, sorry.
14:28:58 <maestro11> nah, no worries. I think you know more than me. :)
14:29:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> Only what I read here, and I seem to remember the topic being discussed recently.
14:30:00 <maestro11> That works then. Thank you for your help!
14:31:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Use ClamAV.
14:34:44 <ulmirdin[m]> <maestro11 "I am confused by the removal of "> It's used for testing. Icon was removed because users usually confuse it with a calendar app and try to use it (and obviously fail).
14:35:44 <dannyknoll3[m]> <maestro11 "Ah, nice. That's not exactly wha"> maestro11: What changelog were you looking at, lol?
14:36:31 <ulmirdin[m]> It provides a way to view calendars provided by actual calendar apps.

15:25:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Yep, it works perfectly, I haven't found a bug yet
15:28:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Does anybody know if GOS has some kind of max. battery saving mode?
15:30:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Not yet at least. Just the basic one turning on dark theme and restricting network synchronization
15:33:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> "network synchronization"?
15:33:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Yeah I mean background sync
15:33:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Calendar, mails and stuff
15:33:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Where does it sync to?
15:34:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Depends
15:34:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> I am talking about your mail client, signal or some service that you are running
15:35:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Graphene has no telemetry if thats what scares you
15:35:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Oh. Apps using Internet in the background.
15:36:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Yes

15:57:27 <jay46> New sms messages do not make any notification sound at all. I did everything possible to get them too.... even just factory reset my phone and still they wont make a sound.

16:13:06 <sjsndnjdejd> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<alpha164> What is the best sour"> Whatever is easier for you to update
16:31:15 <jay46> sjsndnjdejd: My phones acting weird.. any ideas on this... Notifications for SMS messages wont make sounds.. I even factory reset. But whats also weird.. Is at one point prior to factory reset.. when I had multiple users.. I disabled Calendar in one of the users, and Calendar disappeared from all users, even when I re-enabled in it the user I had
16:31:15 <jay46> disabled it in. It just would not come back as an app. Now... after factory reset, and SMS messages, while coming up at top notifications, still do not make a sound... but also after factory reset, the Calendar App is just missing, I can see it in all system apps in settings as there, but it wont come up as a clickable icon.  ...  Shouldnt a
16:31:16 <jay46> Factory Reset be something you can count on to go back to full original install ?
16:33:09 <ulmirdin[m]> Calendar icon was removed in the latest update.
16:33:31 <jay46> ok.. that explains that part... I was hella confused.. !! ha...
16:33:46 <jay46> just happened to change that in update a couple days after initial install for me..
16:34:56 <jay46> well... any ideas from anyone on why SMS messages wont make a sound ???  I mean.. it shouldnt take a tutorial to fix.. but I even read some of those online for any ideas if I missed anything.. and I cant figure it out...  If I install an App from Aurora, after the install a notification comes up and it makes the default notification sound... But
16:34:57 <jay46> I cannot find any way to make an incoming SMS make a sound..
16:36:03 <ulmirdin[m]> The SMS app doesn't work as well on a secondary profile.
16:36:34 <ulmirdin[m]> I don't know about notification sounds exactly.
16:36:53 <ulmirdin[m]> * I don't know about notification sounds specifically.
16:37:45 <jay46> One of the big pointers on the GrapheneOS site is just to use the main Admin to manage other users. So the only thing I added to Admin users was the VPN I use, but immediately just setup in a secondary user. Definitely need SMS sounds though..
16:38:37 <jay46> thanks for at least making me aware of the calendar... that had me tripping like I needed to install grapheneos all over again, which seemed weird and not to make sense.. just the timing of that update change thru me off.. thank you for that info tho

17:09:53 <bizanon[m]> `test`
17:09:59 <bizanon[m]> ```test```
17:11:06 <bizanon[m]> How do in type code block here😅
17:11:55 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: like you did the second time, but ``` as top and bottom and test in between
17:12:19 <bizanon[m]> ```
17:12:20 <bizanon[m]> Test

17:12:41 <bizanon[m]> ``` test ```
17:12:44 <nscnt[m]> huh
17:12:59 <nscnt[m]> ```
17:12:59 <nscnt[m]> test
17:12:59 <nscnt[m]> ```
17:13:28 <bizanon[m]> * ``` test
17:13:38 <nscnt[m]> the first test should work
17:14:48 <bizanon[m]> ```
17:14:48 <bizanon[m]> test
17:14:48 <bizanon[m]> ```
17:14:51 <nscnt[m]> lol, open an empty room for testing
17:15:12 <nscnt[m]> direct message with yourself
17:15:49 <bizanon[m]> Not working 😑
17:18:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Does anybody know if GOS can be installed using a magnetic port and cable?
17:18:51 * bizanon[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PKXnvktbNNyRmerOBDVgfKPI/message.txt >
17:19:15 <bizanon[m]> I can't modify built.prop cause gos is not rooted right?
17:20:25 <bizanon[m]> I'm trying yo bypass T-Mobile hotspot throttle
17:32:15 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - we recommend using the official Google branded cables for installing GrapheneOS, or a 3.1 Generation 1 or Generation 2 USB A to C Cable from Anker or Aukey. Any other cables, you are on your own.
17:33:48 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - of course, you can let us know what results you get here if you try, but we just can't guarantee it'll work with any others.
17:35:06 <Hooly[m]> The USB-A to USB-C cable that comes with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller worked without problems for me.
17:35:36 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: App-accessible root will never be allowed on GrapheneOS. Not even netd has root equivalent access, I think only kernel, init and vold do and the kernel will still enforce the mandatory access controls.
17:35:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hooly[m]: good to know that!
17:35:54 <bizanon[m]> Gotcha
17:36:14 * bizanon[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210309-113415.png (134KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/OEXdSNQSyOWKYmggkZTMsylu/Screenshot_20210309-113415.png >
17:36:15 <bizanon[m]> Still figuring out how I can bypass this limit
17:36:58 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Pay your smartphone carrier more money.
17:37:33 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: I don't know what the laws are where you are, but here, you can be charged for Theft Of Services which can be a misdemeanour, or a felony depending on how much you stole.
17:37:41 <Hooly[m]> This is their infrastructure you're using. They can do whatever they want.
17:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> I will not encourage you to do so.
17:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hooly[m]: yeah, nailed it.
17:38:48 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: likely they do their own accounting on their end as well. Even if you did find some way of bypassing a clientside check, it's likely that their terms of service probably includes a clause that in the event of a disparity between your device and their accounting, their tally on your data usage will be taken as correct.
17:38:58 <TheJollyRoger> So you're not doing yourself any favours.
17:38:59 <Hooly[m]> Plus, you are connecting with your SIM-card and they know exactly who you are.
17:38:59 <Hooly[m]> Just don't.
17:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, unless you want to get cut off.
17:40:36 <TheJollyRoger> This is not topical to GrapheneOS and has to do only with you and your cellphone service carrier.
18:28:53 <morepheus[m]> * FYI https://70.schedule.icann.org  ICANN pre-week is this week.  Topics coveted ISP, DNS, privacy and others. We are stake holders which are affected by their policies.  Don't mind the graphics, it's a blunder.
19:12:57 <criticalcomposer> Does Graphene provide a way to disable trackers or loggers on a per-app basis? I used to use Warden for this (awesome software from the Aurora team) but as it uses root it isn't an option.
19:12:57 <criticalcomposer> I'm anticipating the "just don't use apps with trackers” argument, which is 100% valid in a graphene chat room, but I'm curious if it has the functionality baked in or if its even on the roadmap
19:13:33 <kiwi_62> help
19:15:15 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: it's misguided
19:15:28 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: all apps are sandboxed, you have control over what data you give them and grant them access to
19:15:55 <glass_sky[m]> thanks for ban strcat
19:15:59 <glass_sky[m]> now why did you?
19:15:59 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: you're looking at the output of enumerating badness apps where the authors have fairly arbitrarily classified certain 3rd party libraries as 'trackers' without reasonable criteria
19:16:14 <strcat[m]> glass_sky: don't know who this is but ban evasion isn't appropriate
19:16:20 <strcat[m]> glass_sky: contact via direct message rather than evading bans...
19:16:59 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: an app using third party libraries does not grant it capabilities it doesn't already have, it's just more code
19:17:51 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: also suggest reading https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356400290640125952
19:18:12 <strcat[m]>  * criticalcomposer: an app using some third party libraries does not grant it capabilities it doesn't already have, it's just more code
19:18:17 <strcat[m]>  * criticalcomposer: an app using some of those third party libraries does not grant it capabilities it doesn't already have, it's just more code
19:18:58 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: in most cases the libraries being flagged by the enumerating badness apps are stuff like crash reporting, telemetry (reporting statistics on how the app is used), etc. and in almost 0 cases will any of them do anything without the app explicitly using them and setting them up
19:19:41 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: here's the problem: you don't trust the app with certain libraries, but you do with them disabled?
19:19:47 <strcat[m]> the app devs can do anything those can do in their own code
19:19:56 <strcat[m]> and they already have to set those up and call into them from their own code
19:20:09 <strcat[m]> they could also simply rename the library package name and then you wouldn't see it in a list
19:20:35 <strcat[m]> literally just looking at the output of checking for certain class paths based on a very arbitrary, poorly done list of 'tracking' libraries
19:20:57 <strcat[m]> don't give apps you don't trust sensitive data / access
19:21:25 <strcat[m]> and using sketchy third party code is certainly a valid reason to not trust an app but I don't see how disabling certain bits of it you don't like makes it something you would trust with data
19:23:12 <criticalcomposer> A bit of the terminology went over my head but I understand the concept of sandboxes. I have one single app who's function I desire but isn't found 100% working in a safer app. I'll look into the app itself sometime this week and see what's being utilized and what data is being sent and see how that works within my personal threat model.
19:23:22 <criticalcomposer> Thanks a ton for the detailed response.
19:24:18 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: if you don't trust the app, don't give it sensitive data or grant access to it
19:24:46 <strcat[m]> criticalcomposer: the app will change from update to update and you're certainly not going to be identifying exactly what it does based on analyzing every bit of code
19:24:57 <strcat[m]> you couldn't even do that for a specific version
19:25:01 <strcat[m]> it's just not how stuff really works

19:26:25 <worldatlarge[m]> good day
19:28:16 <nscnt[m]> Don't know... Supports the decision
19:28:19 <strcat[m]> and they went on to ban evade one more time
19:28:25 <strcat[m]> probably going to keep making more accounts here too
19:28:41 <strcat[m]> pretty sure they were a sockpuppet account of someone I had banned earlier in the first place
19:29:06 <strcat[m]> don't know why they're even here, they're just here to mislead people with dishonest claims they know are wrong
19:29:29 <strcat[m]> they're here to tell people they don't need secure hardware/firmware or updates for it, essentially
19:29:34 <strcat[m]> over and over, on a daily basis
19:29:37 <strcat[m]> from multiple accounts
19:29:38 <strcat[m]> no thanks
19:32:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> OK.
19:32:50 <gtkharlem0[m]> this is way too intense of a room
19:36:47 <strcat[m]> tired of people with enough time to make endless sockpuppet accounts and raid the channel
19:37:29 <strcat[m]> I hope everyone can now understand based on their little demonstration of why they had to be banned
20:03:26 <gnujihad[m]1> I disagree with ur statement
20:04:07 <gnujihad[m]1> I feel as though you’ve got a slight superiority complex
20:05:10 <Thatcher[m]> I consider him superior to me
20:05:25 <gnujihad[m]1> Well that’s tragic
20:05:40 <strcat[m]> oh look it's the same troll on another sockpuppet
20:05:42 <strcat[m]> look at the username
20:06:04 <strcat[m]> they have a bunch of sockpuppets here and having been causing problems over the past week

20:09:32 <Thatcher[m]> Would be nice if these chats had some kind of subscriber mode so only paid accounts can chat, like Twitch or something. That would end the trolling immediately.
20:10:27 <madaidan[m]> Bruh I'm not paying for a matrix room
20:10:34 <alex-resist> Or people have to apply and then there's a 24 hour or 7 day waiting period. That would be very frustrating for trolls, too
20:10:43 <alex-resist> Idk if that's possible on IRC/Matrix though
20:11:17 <vdge[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Would be nice if these chats had"> We poor bruh
20:11:28 <strcat[m]> this guy made ~10 accounts, and has been causing problems across them for days
20:11:45 <strcat[m]> I suspected it was the same person or a group of them already
20:12:12 <strcat[m]> sometimes people just make sockpuppets because they like talking to themselves and agreeing with themselves from other accounts to make it look like there's a consensus on what they say
20:12:17 <strcat[m]> it's pretty sad
20:12:31 <strcat[m]> looking back in logs can see them talking to themselves
20:13:26 <Thatcher[m]> That's really sad
20:13:41 <Thatcher[m]> Wtf is wrong with those people
20:15:00 <unknown01234[m]> That's just sad
20:15:06 <bill_in_mtl[m]> I'm not sure if adding steps for the overall base of users who are here for good reason is a good solution.  Manage the exceptions which appears to be what is happening.  I do not have to agree or disagree with how these individuals are managed - that's what moderators are for, no ?
20:25:41 <Lotus[m]1> Well the problem with the main matrix homeserver is that make signups email optional
20:25:45 <Thatcher[m]> Some form of verification would be nice. If it were at least a $1 to chat premium option then the trolls would have to ask their mothers to borrow the credit card so they can make another troll account.
20:27:28 <Lotus[m]1>  * Well the problem with the main matrix homeserver is that make signups email optional. It would be better if they required a valid email for signing up. This would also effectively reduce the load on the homeserver.

20:36:38 <case_[m]> Hi all, quick question, does GOS supports notifications?
20:37:17 <strcat[m]> yes, ofc
20:39:12 <case_[m]> I has the idea that notifications had to go through google messaging system
20:39:21 <case_[m]> * I had the idea that notifications had to go through google messaging system
20:39:32 <strcat[m]> no, that's not true at all
20:39:42 <strcat[m]> first of all, there isn't really any Google notification system
20:40:16 <strcat[m]> case_: baseline Android does not include proprietary Google apps and services in the first place
20:40:27 <strcat[m]> case_: baseline Android doesn't have Play services
20:40:34 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't remove those, they aren't there to begin with in AOSP
20:40:52 <strcat[m]> notifications obviously work fine in Android without Play services, as does all other base OS functionality
20:41:35 <strcat[m]> case_: in order to provide notifications of events from a server in the background, apps need to implement some way of checking the server or having the server inform them of events
20:42:12 <strcat[m]> so, traditionally, they can either poll (inefficient and lack of immediate notification) or use 'long polling' aka push where they keep open a connection and at a less frequent rate than normal polling ping it to keep it active
20:43:11 <strcat[m]> case_: as an optimization, Play services has a push system that always goes through their servers, the app server instead notifies Google's server and it wakes up the app with an event, it is not specifically for 'notifications' as in the user-facing concept of a notification though
20:43:29 <strcat[m]> and there are other ways to do things
20:43:49 <strcat[m]> case_: there is no problem with notifications or with push on GrapheneOS, it works fine, as it does on Android
20:44:47 <strcat[m]> case_: if apps have a hard dependency on Play services for ANYTHING then they aren't going to have full functionality on AOSP / GrapheneOS, or the app won't work at all if they completely can't handle it not being there
20:44:57 <strcat[m]> it is not specific to any particular Google service offered by Play services
20:44:59 <strcat[m]> it's a general thing
20:45:55 <strcat[m]> bizanon: I don't think tether_dun_required (TETHER_DUN_REQUIRED) does anything

20:46:29 <juanjulio[m]> Hi! I’m concerned about some apps identifying who I am after installing/uninstalling. Reading the FAQ’s I read that for most modern apps this data is deleted. Can anyone confirm if this is true for apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and dating apps or can they sneakily hide stuff like they do on IOS?
20:46:50 <strcat[m]> what do you mean 'identifying who I am'?
20:46:57 <strcat[m]> you'll need to clarify what you mean
20:47:04 <strcat[m]> it's ambiguous / vague, can't be answered
20:47:40 <juanjulio[m]> You're right- I mean can they leave their own UDID like tag on device
20:47:50 <juanjulio[m]> so they know it's being reinstalled on same device
20:48:00 <juanjulio[m]> sorry just waking up!
20:48:18 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: if they target modern Android, no, they can't leave data on the device
20:48:48 <strcat[m]> if they don't, then they can store stuff in their external storage directory, which you would have to manually clear
20:48:52 <strcat[m]> the directories in Android/
20:48:57 <strcat[m]> in your profile's home directory
20:49:15 <strcat[m]> modern apps can store stuff in their directory there too but it's cleared when removing it
20:49:47 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: an app can't identify that it is being reinstalled on the same *device* regardless, but an app can know it is being installed again on the same user profile as before
20:50:06 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: apps don't have access to hardware/device identifiers
20:50:50 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: also if you give it write access to say, contacts, then of course it can store something in there
20:50:51 <strcat[m]> since you granted it permission to do that
20:52:14 <juanjulio[m]> Thanks for the great explanation. GrapheneOS was the reason I bought a Pixel so I'm quite new to android!
20:52:51 <juanjulio[m]> Two more questions if anyone can help!
20:52:52 <juanjulio[m]> GrapheneOS includes Seedvault but I tried enabling backup and it’s asking me to backup to a USB drive or some cloud service. It does NOT offer to backup on your phone as shown on the demo on the seedvault website. Is this normal? Would be great if backed up locally so I can restore apps when needed.
20:53:29 <strcat[m]> you can back up locally on your phone
20:54:15 <juanjulio[m]> I see it now! Duh
20:54:32 <juanjulio[m]> One last question
20:55:03 <juanjulio[m]> I realize that user profiles are a great way to isolate apps. Whats the best way to “share” data within the phone between different users (photos, text snipets/ files)?
20:55:10 <strcat[m]> network
20:55:33 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: they can't share data / communicate other than via network
20:55:36 <strcat[m]> it can be done via localhost
20:55:58 <strcat[m]> so, a network-based file sharing app, or even just something like ssh
20:56:21 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to go via some server
20:56:29 <juanjulio[m]> Is there something like files that mounts network drives?
20:56:34 <strcat[m]> you could just send yourself stuff on element in an end-to-end encrypted chat for example
20:56:46 <strcat[m]> but you could also do it via localhost
20:57:18 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: yeah there are apps supporting network drives but that's probably not a great way to do this since you don't really need a server involved
20:58:33 <strcat[m]> juanjulio: for an app targeting modern Android (scoped storage mandatory) the only non-exploitative way it can detect it's the same user profile is the per-app-signing-key, per-user-profile id (ANDROID_ID) which we intend to tweak to work a bit differently
20:58:37 <strcat[m]> just haven't gotten to it yet
20:59:25 <juanjulio[m]> Awesome thanks for all the great info!
21:20:02 <H1d[m]> Remember that there are normal people that are minors and they can't ask even for that 1$.
21:20:02 <H1d[m]> I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that doing this would stop many people even if they aren't trolls
21:22:43 <strcat[m]> no one involved in channel moderation or the project has suggested anything like that
21:25:19 <juanjulio[m]> Hey again! Silly question. Playing with user profiles for the first time. I just created one, dowloaded the f-droid apk, enabled access for valerium tried to install, pressed install, and it says installing then app not installed. Am I missing something?
21:27:34 <juanjulio[m]> *vanadium
21:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> juanjulio[m]: this is a problem with F-Droid, the version on their website is out of date.
21:28:34 <TheJollyRoger> juanjulio[m]: what happens generally,
21:28:59 <TheJollyRoger> is that someone installs the F-Droid app in one profile, then updates it, then attempts to install the same version on F-Droid's website to another profile.
21:29:29 <TheJollyRoger> Because Android will NOT let you install out of date versions (anti-downgrade protection), you need to go to the repository where the latest version of F-Droid is, and install it from there.
21:30:07 <TheJollyRoger> juanjulio[m]: Apps installed into another profile *must* be the same version, or newer.
21:31:40 <juanjulio[m]> TheJollyRoger: Thanks makes perfect sense. Just need to find latest apk!
21:32:06 <case_[m]> I am currently with lineage os, if i take GOS for a spin will i be able to reinstall LOS if i want?
21:32:28 <case_[m]> I have a pixel 3
21:32:30 <madaidan[m]> <case_[m] "I am currently with lineage os, "> Yes
21:32:57 <case_[m]> Thanks
21:33:38 <TheJollyRoger> juanjulio[m]: yep, you need to find the same or newer.
21:33:57 <TheJollyRoger> case_[m]: yes, you can always revert back to stock if you aren't satisfied with GrapheneOS.
21:34:13 <TheJollyRoger> And from there, you can install Lineage.
21:34:58 <Thatcher[m]> Isn't 1.11 the latest stable build of F-Droid?
21:34:58 <Thatcher[m]> https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_1011050.apk
21:35:30 <Thatcher[m]> https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
21:36:13 <bill_in_mtl[m]> I have version 1.12-alpha1
21:37:52 <Thatcher[m]> * Isn't 1.11 the latest stable build of F-Droid?
21:41:25 <Thatcher[m]> * If you want the latest version from F-Droid's website --> https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
21:44:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it has to be either the same version, or newer. Android will not allow you to downgrade or change certificates UNLESS a future certificate is authorized by a previous one.
22:02:14 <dan-is-a-bloody-> Hey everyone
22:03:20 <dan-is-a-bloody-> just wanna ask a quick Q for all da security beasts like TheJollyRoger  and of course strcat  : is it safe to keep bluetooth on all the time on a phone running grapheneos? i understand it increases the attack surface but is it a realistic concern?
22:03:59 <dannyknoll3[m]> What is your threat model?
22:04:12 <dan-is-a-bloody-> normal life pretty much tbh
22:05:41 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i currently religiously keep bluetooth off whenever i aint using it 4 connecting to a bluetooth speaker or smth
22:05:54 <dan-is-a-bloody-> but i was told its not a big deal to keep it on all the time
22:06:10 <dan-is-a-bloody-> from a security standpoint is that true for your average user?
22:06:42 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i assume u'd need to keep it off in places with a higher risk factor such as at the airport or train station?
22:07:31 <dannyknoll3[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: Difficult to be definitive on "not a big deal". If you're concerned, flick it off, mate lol
22:07:45 <dannyknoll3[m]> * dan-is-a-bloody-legend: Difficult to be definitive on "not a big deal". If you're concerned, flick it off mate, lol

22:13:31 <nick87234> all the used pixels I've purchased have not come with a C to C cord.
22:13:40 <came2complain[m]> I'll update and create a PR as soon as it's optional not mandatory
22:13:48 <strcat[m]> nick87234: that's odd, the factory cable is USB-C to USB-C
22:13:54 <strcat[m]> nick87234: there is no factory USB-A to USB-C cable.
22:14:02 <strcat[m]> nick87234: so, that's not an original cable
22:14:17 <strcat[m]> nick87234: and therefore what we say about most USB-A to USB-C cables being broken applies
22:14:34 <dan-is-a-bloody-> strcat: can u offer no opinion on the bluetooth security for the average user question? wats the worst that can happen for a hijacked bt on a google pixel? doesnt it have isolation or smth?
22:14:41 <nick87234> sorry, factory samsung C/A cable. my used pixels came with junk C/A cords
22:15:00 <dan-is-a-bloody-> any hardening from graphene when it comes to bluetooth?
22:15:09 <strcat[m]> nick87234: use a high quality USB-C to USB-C cable ideally
22:15:27 <strcat[m]> nick87234: can't fix your cable / adapter with troubleshooting, just need a proper cable
22:15:42 <strcat[m]> nick87234: most Android OEM cables are broken

22:16:35 <came2complain[m]> ..
22:16:55 <Dylanger[m]> They'll know you're tethering via the TTL hop count
22:16:57 <nick87234> ok. thanks. the web installer is working great from edge right now. very excited!
22:17:00 <Dylanger[m]> That's one way anyway

22:21:20 <dannyknoll3[m]> Why not?
22:21:27 <Lotus[m]1> bluetooth surprisingly does not consume much battery when left on, for the average phone
22:21:28 <dannyknoll3[m]> <dan-is-a-bloody- "to avoid cold memory attacks?"> That too.
22:21:41 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
22:23:51 <dan-is-a-bloody-> strcat: thats about disk encryption not bluetooth, it doesnt even mention bluetooth
22:24:02 <dan-is-a-bloody-> unless im missing something
22:24:08 <Lotus[m]1> I think he was answering your question on cold memory attacks
22:24:11 <dan-is-a-bloody-> oh i see
22:24:39 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no im not worried about cold memory as much as keeping bt on
22:24:51 <dan-is-a-bloody-> but dan says its the same as keeping wifi on basiaclly
22:25:00 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i guess thats good news
22:25:30 <dan-is-a-bloody-> the wifi and bluetooth radios are on the same chip arent they
22:25:41 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: yes but having both on has more attack surface
22:25:46 <strcat[m]> and there's Bluetooth handling in the OS too
22:25:52 <strcat[m]> if you're not using it ideally disable it
22:26:11 <dan-is-a-bloody-> right, but its not as insecure as adobe flush is what ur sayin
22:26:38 <dan-is-a-bloody-> cuz i keep readin bout these bt exploits all the time and it feels like its as bad as adobe flush
22:26:43 <Dylanger[m]> How much would a BT 0day go for these days? Like 60k?
22:27:02 <Dylanger[m]> Priv escalation another 100?
22:27:15 <Dylanger[m]> Lateral to AP, like 120k?
22:27:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> we are working on a bt auto turn off feature
22:27:20 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i dont think i read about wifi exploits as often as i read about bt exploits
22:27:28 <dan-is-a-bloody-> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<clannad> we are working on a bt"> oh that'd be great m8
22:27:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> i read th4e calyx implementation but that isn't very minimal
22:27:49 <rny> dan-is-a-bloody-: KRACK?
22:28:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> we'd want to ideally reuse some of our preexisting code
22:28:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> so we can maintain it more easily
22:28:22 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no im not sayin there's no wifi exploits just sayin it doesnt seem to happen as often as bluetooth
22:28:24 <rny> if anything, i've found wifi vulnerability to be just as bad as BT vulnerabilities
22:28:30 <bizanon[m]> It seems to me that hotspot WiFi doesn't use the VPN forwarded traffic. Is this correct?
22:28:30 <rny> in terms of impact.
22:28:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> wifi is shit tbh
22:28:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> really bad crypto
22:28:49 <dan-is-a-bloody-> better use 5g?
22:28:53 <dan-is-a-bloody-> with no crypto?
22:28:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> no
22:28:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> just as bad
22:29:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> 5g has crypto and NLA
22:29:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> not very strong though
22:29:23 <dan-is-a-bloody-> bluetooth 5 has good crypto no?
22:29:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> not really
22:30:00 <dan-is-a-bloody-> jesus fuck only tethered connection is safe?
22:30:11 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no wifi hardening possible?
22:30:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> not really
22:30:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> can tap into wires, lol
22:30:22 <rny> not really either. ethernet firmware might be wonky
22:30:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> yes. don't
22:30:27 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ugh
22:30:33 <dan-is-a-bloody-> how to be safe??
22:30:36 <rny> 🙃
22:30:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> most wifi hardening like mac filter is security theater
22:31:02 <rny> anupritaisno1[m]: i'd say it thwarts script kiddies
22:31:12 <rny> but doesnt stop a determined adversary
22:31:13 <rny> that is out and about to fuck you
22:31:27 <dan-is-a-bloody-> so layer 1 security is trash in all possible protocols
22:31:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> just turn off wep, tkip, wpa and if you can wpa2
22:31:38 <dan-is-a-bloody-> so one must encrypt at the application level
22:31:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> it's still terrible
22:31:42 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: networks should not be trusted, in general, and GrapheneOS does not trust networks
22:32:03 <dan-is-a-bloody-> u can say that again dan
22:32:16 <dan-is-a-bloody-> jesus fuck how is shit so fucked up after 30 years still
22:32:24 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i get it in the 90s nobody knew what a crypto was
22:32:33 <strcat[m]> should have proper authentication
22:32:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> daniel is a legend yes
22:32:45 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: securing the network is the wrong approach anyway
22:32:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> he made secure phone os
22:32:48 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: should be using authenticated encryption even on a local network
22:32:48 <dannyknoll3[m]> <dan-is-a-bloody- "jesus fuck how is shit so fucked"> Consumers aren't educated enough to demand better.
22:33:04 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: devices can have proper pairing etc. instead of just blindly trusting local networks

22:33:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> i haven't tried it myself

22:33:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: k
22:33:32 <rny> dannyknoll3[m]: dont think its reasonable to expect users to be security experts just to use a phone safely
22:33:37 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: stronger Wi-Fi encryption won't change that the local network does not provide any meaningful security boundary
22:33:41 <strcat[m]> and shouldn't be trusted to do that
22:33:43 <strcat[m]> it doesn't

22:34:50 <strcat[m]> trusting networks is wrong and misguided
22:34:52 <strcat[m]> just leave it there
22:35:03 <strcat[m]> should be using authenticated encrypted even on a local network
22:35:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> wireguard good?
22:35:20 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i wish encryption was layer 1
22:35:21 <strcat[m]> should not be blindly trusting a local network which also implies trusting every device that has ever been connected

22:35:31 <strcat[m]> networks are not meaningful security boundaries
22:35:37 <strcat[m]> I'll just keep repeating it
22:35:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> no, wireguard for AE

22:35:58 <dan-is-a-bloody-> networks are not security boundaries
22:36:07 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're just falling into the same trap I just described above

22:36:23 <dan-is-a-bloody-> #MyNetworkIsNotYourSecurityBoundary
22:36:43 <strcat[m]> if the application doesn't have authenticated encryption, it's doing it wrong

22:37:28 <juanjulio[m]> Hey, playing with multiple user profiles for the first time, and since you can't turn on developer options for secondary users, I was wondering since I user location faker on my main profile if that info gets passed on to the secondary users or only real gps coordinates? Any workarounds as I want to run certain apps in isolation but don't want them to know where I am
22:37:32 <strcat[m]> it should have authenticated encryption to access it with some pairing mechanism like scan a QR code on your phone off it

22:38:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> LOL
22:38:36 <strcat[m]> > Telesforo Aviles, a 35-year-old former employee of home and small office security company ADT, said that over a five-year period, he accessed the cameras of roughly 200 customer accounts on more than 9,600 occasions—all without the permission or knowledge of customers. He said he took note of homes with women he found attractive and then viewed their cameras for sexual gratification. He said he watched nude women an
22:38:36 <strcat[m]> couples as they had sex.

22:39:27 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): treat them as totally untrusted and assume that interception is happening, sure
22:39:32 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): in general, avoid them
22:39:37 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): applies in general
22:39:51 <dannyknoll3[m]> Sorry — whatever new hotness is https =]
22:40:00 <strcat[m]> Chromium totally dropped support for mixed content so either TLS is used or not
22:40:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> google: The connection to this site is encrypted and authenticated using QUIC, X25519, and AES_128_GCM. dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro)

22:40:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: ah nice
22:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> should uninstall https everywhere then
22:41:10 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: righto! So: any defense in depth value to moving up from WPA2 Personal — or no?
22:41:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> well yes
22:41:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> wpa2 is dated crypto
22:41:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> so do get rid of it
22:41:43 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): your local network isn't secure, regardless and isn't a meaningful security boundary
22:41:47 <dannyknoll3[m]> * strcat: righto! So: any defense in depth value to moving up from WPA2 Personal (for example) — or no?
22:41:54 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): is there a reason not to just treat your local network with as much trust as your ISP network?
22:41:57 <strcat[m]> why trust your local network at all?
22:41:59 <strcat[m]> just don't
22:42:03 <strcat[m]> there you go, saved you a bunch of effort
22:42:20 <dannyknoll3[m]> I don't want to trust it, but I don't want to save an attacker any effort, either
22:42:35 <rny> what does that mean ^
22:42:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> most of our current crypto issues are because people insist on using shit like tls1 or ssl3
22:43:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> get rid of dated crypto like wpa2 at least
22:43:09 <dannyknoll3[m]> It means, I know my network still shouldn't be trusted — but still want to do meaningful best practices.
22:43:13 <Lotus[m]1> I wish people would stop calling TLS "SSL"
22:43:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> wpa3 isn't great fyi
22:43:20 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: stronger Wi-Fi en"> Of course your devices should not be trusting the network but that doesn't mean you shouldn't at least try to secure it — it can still be useful for defence in depth.
22:43:42 <dannyknoll3[m]> * Should I apply this to using Vanadium by refusing to use sites without HTTPS?
22:43:52 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: a lot of ppl are just using a VPN anyway
22:44:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> anyway i gotta go back to work, bye
22:44:57 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: if someone is using a VPN which doesn't allow leaks then they can't even accidentally access their local network anyway
22:45:10 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "why trust your local network at "> I think Danny meant to ask if there would be any advantage in securing the network *in addition to* your devices distrusting it for defence in depth.
22:45:16 <rny> so VPNs are trustworthy?
22:45:26 <strcat[m]> who said that?
22:45:34 <rny> ok, just double-checking
22:45:41 <mynacol[m]> Regarding the auto-Bluetooth-disable feature: There is Greentooth https://gitlab.com/nbergman/greentooth Untested !
22:45:45 <rny> 🙃
22:45:49 <strcat[m]> > networks are not meaningful security boundaries
22:45:57 <strcat[m]> > trusting networks is wrong and misguided
22:46:03 <rny> 👏 for consistency.
22:46:19 <strcat[m]> a VPN is just gateway to another untrusted network
22:46:29 <strcat[m]> useful for the purpose of blending in with other users via shared IP
22:46:38 <strcat[m]>  * a VPN is just tunnel to another untrusted network
22:47:00 <rny> even an authenticated vpn setup using wg?
22:47:02 <strcat[m]> keeping in mind that the VPN provider could do logging and distinguish between who is using it, or could be compromised
22:47:12 <rny> not talking about shared vpn providers.
22:47:13 <strcat[m]> rny: still just a tunnel to another untrusted network
22:47:19 <strcat[m]> rny: even if it's your own network
22:47:30 <dannyknoll3[m]> Just had the System UI epic crash on 3aXL — will attempt to find logs/reports now
22:47:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): which
22:47:48 <strcat[m]> rny: the VPN is just giving you a secure tunnel to another insecure network
22:47:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> pm me the logs
22:48:04 <Lotus[m]1> strcat:  that'd be different, if you had a VPN tunnel on a physical server used to access a localhost IP on that server
22:48:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> an approaximate time when it happened is required
22:48:17 <anupritaisno1[m]>  * an approximate time when it happened is required
22:48:20 <dannyknoll3[m]> anupritaisno1: Just lmk which ones you want, friend - haven't pulled any in some time
22:48:44 <strcat[m]> /dev/null: trusting localhost is bad too, not as bad, but still bad
22:48:53 <bizanon[m]> Hey is the forwarded VPN traffic being broadcasted out as AP? I think it does.. Just trying to figure out why the speed of my connected devices on the AP are being throttled any ideas? ISP should not be able to differentiate between phone VPN browsing vs. External device VPN browsing.
22:48:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> ok but send me the time it happened too so i can just read the part where it happened
22:49:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Depending on the provider.
22:50:11 <strcat[m]> /dev/null: stuff on localhost should really have authentication too, better off using unix sockets that are appropriately restricted
22:50:41 <rny> strcat[m]: you must be strongly opposed towards services that terminate TLS at a https proxy
22:51:16 <strcat[m]> TLS should be terminated as the endpoint handling stuff
22:51:18 <strcat[m]> TLS is lightweight
22:51:29 <strcat[m]> it's just misguided to have some TLS unwrapping thing, what's the point?
22:52:08 <strcat[m]> I don't see how people can hope to speed things up by putting an extra layer in between
22:52:15 <strcat[m]> and you just create weaknesses and a single point of failure
22:52:53 <bizanon[m]> Hey actually I just tested it, and after I enabled VPN, and turned on my WiFi hotspot and connected my laptop, I checked the IP, and it wasn't the VPN IP. Hotspot traffic is separate from vpn on the phone.
22:52:54 <strcat[m]> say that this is your setup: clients -> nginx load balancer -> app servers
22:53:15 <rny> in a sense, it is a single point of failure
22:53:17 <strcat[m]> the connections to the app servers should really be TLS connections
22:53:24 <rny> if the load balancer goes down, the entire stack is down
22:53:34 <strcat[m]> and nginx should ideally not be terminating TLS and then making new connections
22:53:56 <strcat[m]> rny: nginx can do load balancing without terminating TLS
22:54:01 <rny> strcat[m]: well i agree with you
22:54:10 <rny> but im just saying many firms terminate TLS at a https proxy.
22:54:20 <strcat[m]> you can even send stuff to different endpoints based on the SNI name
22:54:22 <strcat[m]> without terminating TLS
22:54:23 <strcat[m]> http://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_ssl_preread_module.html
22:54:38 <strcat[m]> you only need to terminate TLS if you want centralized caching, etc.
22:54:47 <strcat[m]> which of course, is a single point of failure for security
22:54:54 <rny> i think that's quite recent being able to send stuff based on SNI at the TCP level
22:55:21 <strcat[m]> rny: nginx in front of app server makes a ton of sense, terminating TLS with nginx is fine too *within the same VM/container as the endpoint*
22:55:36 <strcat[m]> not to make unencrypted / unauthenticated connections to the backend
22:56:02 <strcat[m]> rny: so for example in that load balancer case
22:56:09 <strcat[m]> what I'm saying people should be doing is:
22:57:11 <strcat[m]> clients -> [ nginx load balancers ] -> [ nginx on app servers -> app server backends ]
22:57:17 <strcat[m]> where [ ] are the separate instances
22:57:30 <strcat[m]> and the connections from clients -> load balancers and load balancers -> backend are ofc secure ones
22:58:17 <strcat[m]> rny: anyway you can start off just using DNS round robin with your app servers, then you can switch to DNS round robin for load balancers in front later
22:58:20 <rny> wait till you talk to microservices fanbois
22:58:24 <strcat[m]> rny: it's not like most services are Google scale stuff
22:58:39 <strcat[m]> rny: as long as they do proper authenticated encryption between all of them
22:59:04 <rny> there's a view that AE itself is a microservice
22:59:07 <rny> LOL
23:10:55 <strcat[m]> if people are interested in contributing please look through https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues, https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues, https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/issues, https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer/issues, https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/issues
23:10:55 <strcat[m]> etc
23:11:18 <strcat[m]> we need more contributors and we're interested in funding work on standalone projects, such as what we did with the web installer
23:11:23 <Anondye> Could someone help me with a install on GOS. I keep coming across an issue. Bootloader is unlocked I'm trying to ./flash-all but keep getting an error saying fastboot too old
23:11:53 <strcat[m]> and once someone is contributing (included a funded project) maybe we can start paying them to do full time work (depends on cost of living where you are, etc. though)
23:12:10 <strcat[m]> Anondye: follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web (recommended) or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
23:12:16 <strcat[m]> sounds like you tried to use an unofficial guide
23:12:23 <strcat[m]> we recommend the web installer for people not experienced with CLI
23:12:58 <strcat[m]> if you did follow an unofficial guide, strongly recommend stopping that immediately, removing / undoing anything it had you do, and going to the official install guides
23:13:48 <Anondye> the download was from the offical GOS site.
23:13:56 <strcat[m]> I'm not talking about the download
23:14:23 <strcat[m]> Anondye: it appears that you're following unofficial guides and may have installed third party fastboot software
23:14:33 <strcat[m]> Anondye: you should stop following any unofficial guide if you were doing that
23:14:53 <strcat[m]> remove anything it had you install, undo any changes it had you make and reboot to make sure something like adb from it isn't still running
23:14:53 <Anondye> following the cli on GOS
23:14:59 <strcat[m]> the official guide?
23:15:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
23:15:32 <Anondye> there we go now its working
