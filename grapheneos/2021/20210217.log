00:25:15 <m2tu[m]> ok thanks
00:28:35 <bypassbobby[m]> Does anyone have any methods for using password managers to login to apps. Would having a profile for password managers then a profile for apps be the most secure?
00:31:54 <bypassbobby[m]> Or a profile for an app and its corresponding password manager in the same profile?
00:43:43 <Thatcher[m]> I use a password manager with corresponding trusted apps in the same profile. No need to make it more complex then it should be. For apps you don't trust, use a different profile with a password manager for those apps.
00:44:48 <Thatcher[m]> I use KeePassDX with the Magic Keyboard to avoid copying sensitive information to the clipboard
00:46:48 <Thatcher[m]> * I use a password manager with corresponding trusted apps in the same profile. No need to make it more complex then it should be. For apps you don't trust, use a different profile with a separate password database for those apps.
00:47:20 <bypassbobby[m]> <Thatcher[m] "I use a password manager with co"> Thanks for the tip whats magic keyboard?
00:48:29 <Thatcher[m]> MagicKeyboard is a special keyboard that is part of the KeePassDX app that allows filling in your credentials without exposing your credentials to the clipboard
00:50:23 <Thatcher[m]> You can summon the keyboard at a credential screen by pressing a button that allows you to switch to the MagicKeyboard
00:54:38 <Thatcher[m]> It's pretty awesome, but keep a separate database with untrusted apps in another profile to avoid accidentally cross-contaminating credentials at the login screens.
00:54:46 <bypassbobby[m]> <Thatcher[m] "You can summon the keyboard at a"> Which button do you press? I can only get it to use standard clipboard
00:55:08 <Thatcher[m]> You have to go into the options of KeePassDX and enable the MagicKeyboard
00:59:57 <bypassbobby[m]> <Thatcher[m] "You have to go into the options "> Figured it out. Thanks
01:01:34 <Thatcher[m]> Takes a bit getting used to, but much better opsec than copying to clipboard
01:01:46 <bypassbobby[m]> I noticed I could see the default password length i use in my keyfile in the settings of keepass when I wasn't even logged in

03:17:21 <hasnoname[m]> Can I ask for a feature request? To be able to still connect within lan when network for the app is set to off?
03:28:27 <grapheneos_user_> <hasnoname[m] "Can I ask for a feature request?"> I dont think thats feasible, since once an app has network access, whether it can access the internet is in the router's hands. But I could be wrong too
03:30:35 <grapheneos_user_> Maybe the os could access 192.168.x.x IPs though
03:31:51 <grapheneos_user_> * Maybe the os could allow access to 192.168.x.x IPs though
03:32:52 <take_a_deep_brea> hasnoname:  its alright to ask for a feature . but there are a few things that need to be done . you need to justify the feature and if so inclined describe how do you think you would go about it .
03:33:38 <take_a_deep_brea> but first i would say you better come up with some compelling reasons for this feature .
03:33:56 <grapheneos_user_> <take_a_deep_brea "but first i would say you better"> Home automation

03:35:00 <grapheneos_user_> If home automation software is privacy-unfriendly, then allowing only LAN access allows software to be used while maintaining privacy.
03:35:50 <grapheneos_user_> Not the most compelling reason I know
03:36:21 <take_a_deep_brea> and also i suggest further discussion about this take place in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  #grapheneos-offtopic as you can go on there uninterrupted

04:14:24 <gimme5g> hello?
04:15:11 <gimme5g> Do I need to activate my SIM before installing Graphene or can I activate after installing Graphene?
04:16:24 <take_a_deep_brea> well if its a regular SIM then yes you can activate your SIM after installation
04:17:11 <take_a_deep_brea> it also helps to confirm with this room wether your carrier is supported or not as some need apps with weird priviliges to function and so are not usable with graphene
04:17:55 <gimme5g> Mint
04:19:23 <gimme5g> I don't know if it needs an app to set up the service.
04:20:35 <take_a_deep_brea> gimme5g:   till someone answers you directly you can search for "Mint" in the logs https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos unfortunately i myself wont be able to tell you
04:21:02 <take_a_deep_brea> rather https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos&q=mint
04:21:03 <gimme5g> Thanks!
04:21:13 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem .
04:37:37 <gimme5g> Does anyone know if giftcards from the US work on protonmail? I need an e-mail just for the phone?
04:38:22 <gimme5g> Or is it overkill for average person
04:39:27 <TheJollyRoger> gimme5g: service providers that aren't a part of GrapheneOS aren't topical to this channel. I would refer you to the #grapheneos-offtopic channel for that.
04:40:21 <TheJollyRoger> You won't need an E-mail address to use your phone, although having an E-mail address is necessary if you want to use Remote Integrity Monitoring with Auditor and pair with Attestation Server.
04:42:14 <gimme5g> E-mail is needed for the service provider accounts
05:19:56 <southwest[m]> <gimme5g "Mint"> I can confirm Mint works on Graphene. Just install their app (Aurora store) and follow the instructions. Proton Mail has free accounts.
05:36:27 <miketanner[m]> Pls help me.. I have this idea stuck in my head that getting a pixel and installing graphene is going to make the perfect experience on a secure platform.
05:36:28 <miketanner[m]> Can someone bring me back to earth? What's it really likely to be like?
05:37:22 <take_a_deep_brea> well unless you have some apps that wont run wothout play services and you need them for work or somethinglike that you should be fine on graphene
05:39:13 <take_a_deep_brea> also make sure your carrier is found to cause no issues on graphene as some carriers require highly invasive apps to be installed whoch wont work out oon grapheen
05:40:00 <miketanner[m]> Oh yea that could be an issue.. where's the list? I have Verizon
05:40:17 <gimme5g> I think it'll be fine if you put in the work. The Reddit page shows good maps and e-mail apps that work.
05:40:52 <take_a_deep_brea> well there is no list that we keep , but someone should be able to confirm
05:41:27 <take_a_deep_brea> and also you need to make sure your  device can have its bootloader unlocked
05:41:51 <miketanner[m]> Yea that could be an issue too. I'd be getting a Pixel 5
05:46:08 <take_a_deep_brea> miketanner:  ideally get a device from the google store
05:48:49 <miketanner[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "miketanner:  ideally get a devic"> Oh versus getting from verizon?
05:49:12 <take_a_deep_brea> versus getting it from ANYWHERE else , lol
05:49:15 <take_a_deep_brea> no seriously
05:49:53 <take_a_deep_brea>  * no , seriously
05:50:02 <gimme5g> Are you in the USA? Bestbuy and Amazon sells unlocked
05:50:21 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Is it worth waiting for Pixel 5 support or just grab a 4?
05:50:35 <take_a_deep_brea> well they claim its unlocked . not the same thing  .
05:51:03 <miketanner[m]> Yup, USA. I'd wait for a 5, I need the features
05:51:58 <take_a_deep_brea> <tacticalnewfy[m] "Is it worth waiting for Pixel 5 "> pixel 5 will be supported . right now its experimental but should become stable eventually . you can ask around , people are already on graphene on a pixel 5 . well , some are .
05:53:22 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Yeah... I'm looking to get my first one. I was on the fence about waiting for the 5... or grab a cheap unlocked 3 or something off eBay and use that first. Test the waters and get used to it. Then when 5 us fully supported move over.
05:54:05 <miketanner[m]> tacticalnewfy: i love that idea. How much are 3s going for?
05:54:27 <tacticalnewfy[m]> I've seen some on ebay for $160ish
05:55:10 <gimme5g> given the 3 year expected support a 4a make more sense financialy
05:55:43 <take_a_deep_brea> true and 4a may be supported for as long as 4a 5G ,5 anyways
05:56:32 <tacticalnewfy[m]> If there was a warranty issue with the phone could you flash it back to Google easy enough?
05:56:55 <miketanner[m]> Yea but as a learning setup the 3 would be fine I'd think
05:57:29 <miketanner[m]> <tacticalnewfy[m] "If there was a warranty issue wi"> Because graphene would void the warranty?
05:57:41 <entry1[m]> 4a is clear cut winner value wise for longevity. August 2023 is a nice length. I wouldn't get a 4 personally and the 5 is too costly. miketanner 3a is till May 2022 so its a great value. Just make sure you get the G020G model
05:57:43 <take_a_deep_brea> google pixels are made keeping AOSP developers in mind so no you can flash and reflash as many times as you want and your warranty wont be void because of that
05:57:44 <somenerd[m]> it wouldn't
05:57:51 <somenerd[m]> afaik it doesn't void the warranty
05:58:29 <tacticalnewfy[m]> fair enough... the newer pixel phones are pretty solid these days anywho I'm not to worried
06:00:45 <miketanner[m]> <entry1[m] "4a is clear cut winner value wis"> 4a 5G version I assume?
06:01:20 <take_a_deep_brea> well if you are planning on installing graphene : https://grapheneos.org/install is the way to go . please read the website  carefully before starting the procedure and also there is a webUSB installer that can be used from up-to-date  chromium/chrome/Edge browser
06:01:41 <take_a_deep_brea> i am saying this now cause we still have people who come over here after following obsolete , misleading videos on youtube
06:02:44 <take_a_deep_brea>  * well if you are planning on installing graphene : https://grapheneos.org/install is the best way to go . please read the website  carefully before starting the procedure and also there is a webUSB installer that can be used from up-to-date  chromium/chrome/Edge browser

06:03:47 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Yeah I spent a bit of time on the website it's got a pretty good guide. I might just get a cheap pixel phone to practice on haha... it's been so long since playing to flashing phones. Used to do it all the time back in the day when android sucked but now it's so good I haven't needed to. Well till big brother came along haha
06:04:38 <miketanner[m]> Wait.. pixels don't take microsd cards to expand storage?
06:04:50 <miketanner[m]> (Found this comparing 4a to 5)
06:05:14 <take_a_deep_brea> well 128GB is enough for most of us lol
06:05:21 <take_a_deep_brea>  * well 128Gb is enough for most of us lol
06:05:38 <gimme5g> its GrapheneOS you won't be needing that much.
06:06:28 <miketanner[m]> I have 256G and they're nearly full. Kids.. pics and vids galore
06:06:52 <miketanner[m]> Is graphene that much smaller?
06:07:12 <take_a_deep_brea> its as big as a pixel would provide
06:07:23 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Until Pixel gets a 108MB camera like some of the other ones the 128GB will be fine haha. Until I got into taking 16MB+ pics 128GB was always good enough haha
06:08:23 <TheLoneWanderer[> You guys take pics?
06:10:11 <miketanner[m]> Well ok guys, imma sleep on it, but the 4a is in consideration
06:10:20 <miketanner[m]> Thanks for your help all
06:12:11 <entry1[m]> <miketanner[m] "4a 5G version I assume?"> Nope, 4a is till Aug 23 and 4a 5g is till Nov23. No real reason to get the 4a 5g imo as I'm convinced 5g isn't impressive nor useful to the average user.
06:21:08 <strcat> 4a (5G) isn't really a 4a with 5G
06:21:29 <strcat> it's a different, newer generation device, it's unlikely to be supported significantly longer than the 4a though
06:21:35 <strcat> remains to be seen, it's possible
06:21:55 <strcat> Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 are pretty close to each other, Pixel 5 is a bit fancier
06:22:20 <strcat> they should have called the 4a (5G) something else
06:22:44 <strcat> like calling it a Pixel 5 and calling what they called the Pixel 5, Pixel 5+ or something
06:23:12 <strcat> some kind of strategic marketing choice
06:23:33 <strcat> Pixel 4a got extremely good reviews based on it being almost as good as a high end Pixel at such a low price
06:23:51 <strcat> so I think they are trying to capitalize on that good marketing by having a newer more expensive device called a "4a (5G)"
06:24:04 <strcat> and also it encourages people to upgrade to the 'Pixel 5' because it sounds newer generation than "4a (5G)"
06:24:18 <strcat> basically typical marketing department decision making
06:24:41 <strcat> 4a (5G) and 5 are same generation, same SoC, same kernel source tree
06:25:30 <strcat> or they could have called the 4a (5G) the Pixel 5a, and then called what's coming as the 5a the 5.5a, lol
06:26:32 <take_a_deep_brea> they do complicate things dont they , lmao
06:26:47 <take_a_deep_brea>  * they do complicate things , dont they ? lmao
06:28:36 <somenerd[m]> > some kind of strategic marketing choice
06:28:36 <somenerd[m]> I call it the 4.5a
06:29:22 <somenerd[m]> > or they could have called the 4a (5G) the Pixel 5a, and then called what's coming as the 5a the 5.5a, lol
06:29:22 <somenerd[m]> .5 series now (maybe the a series could be the .5 series)
06:30:01 <somenerd[m]> >I call it the 4.5a
06:30:01 <somenerd[m]> lol didn't read the message that strcat typed when I typed this
06:31:43 <rny[m]> i call it the 4.9 since its so close in spec to the 5
06:31:55 <strcat[m]> somenerd: the actual "4a" is basically "4.2a" because it's a slightly newer but lower end SoC than the "4"
06:32:07 <strcat[m]> somenerd: similar for "3a" iirc
06:32:10 <entry1[m]> Yeah I was fascinated when you mentioned the Pixel 5 has more in common with the 4a 5g than the 4a does with the 4a 5g. To me, the budget "a" series seems to be the best way to buy a Pixel device as of now in terms of cost and value per dollar/support length. It is great how GrapheneOS supports them over time and consistently. Plus the budget series has the headphone jack
06:32:29 <strcat[m]> somenerd: btw at one point these device names were roughly based on screen size
06:32:43 <strcat[m]> Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X + Nexus 6P
06:32:46 <strcat[m]> was based on screen size
06:32:54 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: the actual "4a" is basically "4.2a" because it's a slightly newer but lower end SoC than the "4"
06:32:54 <somenerd[m]> 4.25a
06:33:06 <strcat[m]> Nexus 7 (2012), Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 10, Nexus 9
06:33:13 <strcat[m]> all screen size for those
06:33:14 <strcat[m]> and the phones
06:33:29 <strcat[m]> was a pretty stupid way of naming phones
06:33:35 <somenerd[m]> lol
06:33:35 <strcat[m]> they should really just say
06:33:59 <somenerd[m]> yeah, the 4a 5G is confusing though
06:35:12 <somenerd[m]> maybe even more than the Nexus
06:37:14 <somenerd[m]> decimal names are the future
06:37:16 <somenerd[m]> (lol)
06:38:52 <strcat[m]> also Nexus were legitimately LG, HTC, Samsung, etc. devices and they'd actually brand them as such and sell them on their own too
06:38:56 <strcat[m]> that is the kind of arrangement we need
06:39:26 <somenerd[m]> would be cool
06:39:44 <somenerd[m]> > also Nexus were legitimately LG, HTC, Samsung, etc. devices and they'd actually brand them as such and sell them on their own too
06:39:44 <somenerd[m]> so they just had rebranding?
06:39:50 <somenerd[m]> nothing else was different?
06:41:37 <strcat[m]> somenerd: Google had requirements for it being Nexus
06:42:12 <strcat[m]> somenerd: but it was largely designed by the vendors to fit those requirements
06:42:30 <strcat[m]> somenerd: and they had mixed branding
06:43:02 <strcat[m]> a Nexus 5 says nexus and LG on the back
06:43:05 <strcat[m]> not Google
06:43:11 <strcat[m]> and you could buy them from LG
06:43:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "a Nexus 5 says nexus and LG on t"> It says brickbug tbh
06:43:35 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: Nexus 5X was the trash one not Nexus 5
06:43:36 <somenerd[m]> believe that Nexus had unlockable bootloaders
06:43:48 <somenerd[m]> so those LG phones could have alternative ROMs flashed?
06:43:59 <strcat[m]> the main issue with Nexus 5 was the completely trash build of the phone body and USB port
06:44:00 <somenerd[m]> or was that a Google-only requirement?
06:44:22 <strcat[m]> somenerd: the Nexus specific thing was being able to lock bootloader
06:44:30 <strcat[m]> and have verified boot (once that was supported)
06:44:32 <strcat[m]> for an alternate OS
06:44:41 <strcat[m]> Nexus 5X and 6P are the initial devices with full verified boot
06:44:51 <strcat[m]> they always had full security functionality for alternate OSes
06:44:56 <strcat[m]> you could lock bootloaders before then too
06:45:10 <strcat[m]> but it didn't actually have verified boot for the OS before 5X/6P
06:45:51 <strcat[m]> Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 had dm-verity but not verified boot from the bootloader IIRC
06:45:52 <strcat[m]> I can't remember entirely
06:46:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "you could lock bootloaders befor"> the bootloader just didn't verify anything afaik?
06:46:11 <strcat[m]>  * Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 had dm-verity but not verified boot from the bootloader to the OS IIRC
06:46:11 <strcat[m]> so Nexus 6 and 9 had verified boot for firmware
06:46:12 <strcat[m]> and the kernel did verified boot for userspace
06:46:15 <strcat[m]> but they had a missing link from late stage bootloader -> OS
06:46:24 <strcat[m]> which 5X and 6P addressed and provided full verified boot
06:46:37 <strcat[m]> and that's where that 'booting alternate OS' screen was launched
06:46:56 <strcat[m]> since it always supported full functionality for an alternate OS
06:47:03 <strcat[m]> before and after full verified boot
06:47:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then came AVB 2.0
06:47:27 <braxtono[m]> How does one add anonymized DNS relay to orbot?
06:47:29 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the boot chain verified itself, just didn't have a way to verify the boot image of the OS to bootstrap OS verified boot
06:47:46 <strcat[m]> braxtono: using Orbot as a VPN sends DNS via Orbot, as with other VPN services
06:48:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: the boot chain ve"> Oneplus would like to know your location
06:48:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oneplus didn't even verify the bootloader, people managed to boot custom bootloaders
06:49:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> It was only fixed when Google mandated verified boot
06:50:17 <strcat[m]> in Qualcomm terminology 'Secure Boot' is the term for the root of trust verifying the SoC firmware from hardware (key burned into fuses)
06:50:24 <braxtono[m]> https://anonymousplanet.github.io/thgtoa/guide.html#your-dns-requests adding anon DNS would help with cleartext or http
06:50:46 <strcat[m]> so Nexus 5, 6, 9 had 'Secure Boot' (i.e. SoC firmware verified) as did earlier Nexus devices
06:50:54 <strcat[m]> 6 and 9 had dm-verity
06:51:04 <strcat[m]> 5X and 6P bridged the gap between those to provide full verified boot
06:51:16 <strcat[m]> and then Pixel 2 onwards is Android Verified Boot 2.0
06:51:23 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 onwards uses secure element as part of enforcing it
06:51:50 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 onwards has hardware-based attestation, Pixel 3 onwards has HSM-based implementation (secure element)
06:52:23 <strcat[m]> most Android devices have not caught up to the 5X and 6P in this regard (those are from 2015 btw)
06:53:50 <strcat[m]> because unlike the 5X and 6P they don't support doing it for an alternate OS
06:54:17 <strcat[m]> compared to AVB, the 5X / 6P implementation sucks, but it did work
07:10:13 <blacklight447[m]> Does the pixel 5 have any real security benifit against something like the pixel 3/3a?
07:10:33 <strcat> yes
07:11:11 <strcat> due to Titan M, Pixel 3 / 3a did get secure element improvements, although newer generations probably have better physical anti-tampering
07:11:19 <strcat> but the SoC generations bring improved security
07:11:26 <strcat> in hardware/firmware/software
07:18:09 <blacklight447[m]> Would you say those improvements are significant?
07:22:05 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: yes
08:22:29 <goblinslayer[m]> mm how often does google bring out a new phone
08:22:35 <goblinslayer[m]> every 6 or 7 -8 months>?
08:24:50 <strcat[m]> the release cycle is yearly
08:25:22 <strcat[m]> 2 high end phones near October/November, 1 mid-ranged phone near August
08:25:53 <strcat[m]> it's how nearly every company does it
08:25:59 <strcat[m]> the SoC release cycles are yearly
08:26:14 <strcat[m]> Linux kernel LTS branches are yearly
08:29:08 <goblinslayer[m]> wouldnt call them high end yet
08:29:12 <goblinslayer[m]> though I am satisfied
08:30:06 <goblinslayer[m]> does one of the 4 or 5 models actually have some decent battery
08:30:50 <goblinslayer[m]> I hate this shit the companies pull with those little ass batteries
08:31:07 <neelix> goblinslayer[m], just dont consume much :)
08:31:18 <goblinslayer[m]> I am not fully convinced it's because 'the customer' wants a flat phone
08:31:26 <goblinslayer[m]> all the way you know
08:31:29 <goblinslayer[m]> welp
08:31:35 <goblinslayer[m]> what else is there to do
08:32:27 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5 is 4080 mAh
08:32:50 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 was 2800 mAh, Pixel 4 XL was 3700
08:33:14 <goblinslayer[m]> oh thats quite good 4080
08:33:16 <goblinslayer[m]> are any  of the higher hertz?
08:33:23 <strcat[m]> bigger phones generally have better battery life unless you're talking about battery life during GPU-based workloads
08:33:50 <strcat[m]> goblinslayer: the Pixel 5, 4 and 4 XL are 90Hz
08:34:06 <strcat[m]> the software switches between 60 and 90Hz
08:34:20 <strcat[m]> we haven't set up the configuration option for it in Settings yet
08:34:28 <strcat[m]> may just need to set a boolean to enable it
08:35:11 <goblinslayer[m]> I am curious to see how noticable it is in phones
08:35:21 <goblinslayer[m]> haven't had any with 90 hertz as a daily before
08:35:23 <goblinslayer[m]> meanwhile
08:35:31 <goblinslayer[m]> ps5 and xbox one x one one
08:35:34 <b1101> 5 will probably be my next phone.
08:35:41 <goblinslayer[m]> are just on 60 frames
08:35:53 <goblinslayer[m]> it's insane
08:36:03 <b1101> they are?
08:36:09 <goblinslayer[m]> and then the framerate isn't even met so often
08:36:24 <goblinslayer[m]> because "fidelity needs to be pushed"
08:36:26 <goblinslayer[m]> yj
08:36:30 <goblinslayer[m]> yh
08:36:50 <goblinslayer[m]> not that I have any
08:37:07 <goblinslayer[m]> nor do I feel the need to atm
08:37:18 <goblinslayer[m]> do have the ps4 though
08:38:14 <goblinslayer[m]> <strcat[m] "goblinslayer: the Pixel 5, 4 and"> thanks for letting us now ( well me for certain ; ])
08:43:51 <darkwhite[m]> will graphene come to nexus devices?
08:45:21 <strcat[m]> no they've been obsolete and end-of-life for a long time
08:45:26 <strcat[m]> they were supported in the past
08:45:33 <strcat[m]> they were dropped ages ago
08:46:17 <strcat[m]> Nexus 5, Galaxy S4, Nexus 9, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL were previously supported
08:46:59 <strcat> Nexus 5 was the first supported device
08:47:23 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#legacy-devices
08:47:40 <darkwhite[m]> wow i had no idea
08:47:43 <darkwhite[m]> thanks
08:48:17 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 and 2 XL are end-of-life and we don't consider them officially supported but we still do extended support releases for them on an irregular schedule
10:39:45 <mtcw[m]> is the worst case scenario for web installer is a soft-brick? got the 4a 5g today so gonna install it
10:39:57 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
10:40:20 <mtcw[m]> got an anker cable + arch + chromium, should be prepared
10:40:42 <take_a_deep_brea> same holds for cli if you are following the official guide and dont confuse 4a 5g for 4a and vice versa
10:41:06 <take_a_deep_brea> <mtcw[m] "got an anker cable + arch + chro"> good luck ! yes you should be set
10:41:22 <take_a_deep_brea> just make sure you thoroughly read the page
10:41:56 <mtcw[m]> alright, well im updating the stock os atm, not sure if "should" or not but i'll report back later if success or an issue occured
10:42:03 <take_a_deep_brea> like installing udev rules still need to be done manually
10:45:33 <mtcw[m]> just having `android-udev` installed enough for arch?
10:46:39 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
10:48:30 <take_a_deep_brea> the installation page is very explicit , you really dont need  to confirm anything with me as i am no better source of info .
10:48:30 <take_a_deep_brea> just read the web installer page even though there is not much you need to do like in the CLI installer .
10:50:13 <mtcw[m]> fair enough, im going through it now
11:02:10 <mtcw[m]> i did it! this web installer is real nice btw
11:07:54 <take_a_deep_brea> nice , welcome aboard!
11:08:19 <take_a_deep_brea> make sure you  lock the bootloader though.
11:08:44 <mtcw[m]> yeah done that
11:09:33 <take_a_deep_brea> good.
11:10:30 <take_a_deep_brea> also in case you arent aware there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  for discussion about apps and anything else you need to knwo
11:10:38 <take_a_deep_brea> * also in case you arent aware there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  for discussion about apps and anything else you need to know
11:10:46 <take_a_deep_brea> to set up yoir phone
11:10:52 <mtcw[m]> already in that channel
11:11:08 <take_a_deep_brea> great , then .
11:11:23 <mtcw[m]> well i guess now is just figuring out what stuff to move, etc., thanks for your support :)
11:12:09 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem .
11:48:49 <strcat[m]> @room https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26145127 this person is repeatedly spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS
11:48:52 <strcat[m]> they claim to be someone that's in the channel
11:48:56 <strcat[m]> I'd like to know who it is
11:49:15 <strcat[m]> they are repeatedly making false claims about it and lying about the connections that it makes by default
11:49:37 <strcat[m]> they claim to have done research and work on it that they clearly have no actually done beyond skin deep searching through the code and making bad assumptions about that
11:50:02 <strcat[m]>  * they claim to have done research and work on it that they clearly have not actually done beyond skin deep searching through the code and making bad assumptions about that
12:05:18 <snooopy> strcat[m]: Sad to hear that you have to deal with misinformation beside your great project maintaining work :/
12:34:15 <Nikos[m]> I upvoted your response to his post so that HN puts your refutation right below (hopefully).
12:36:51 <strcat[m]> Nikos: I posted more responses there
12:41:21 <Nikos[m]> OK, missed them before, Ctrl+F to the rescue :)
12:42:56 <take_a_deep_brea> @strcat:matrix.org:  if its someone lurking in the channel we'll never know . unless they open their mouth and spell pine64 or de-Googled  here .
12:43:31 <take_a_deep_brea> i am looking at other places they have posted , just in case
12:46:25 <mtcw[m]> huh i refreshed the release page and now both 4a5g + 5 are now marked as new instead of experimental
12:55:15 <tillets> hello, just install on my Pixel 3 XL, first time) Just discovering it. What apps do you recommand? For texting via internet firstly. And how to import my google contacts? Thanks in advance))
12:56:24 <tillets> If I'm in the wrong place, tell me)
12:56:59 <mynacol[m]> tillets: Hi and welcome to GrapheneOS 🙂 As your questions are not directly relevant for Graphene, I ask you to join #grpaheneos-offtopic, where I will gladly answer your questions.
12:57:11 <tillets> thanks
12:57:20 <mynacol[m]> * #grapheneos-offtopic
12:59:21 <zvl12[m]> <mtcw[m] "huh i refreshed the release page"> nice ! Was there any changes between the experimental and the stable version that will be updated on the Pixel (automatically I guess) ?
13:02:10 <strcat[m]> zvl12: it's not a new version
13:02:12 <strcat[m]> it's a change to the site
13:02:31 <strcat[m]> there's nothing in the releases that says they are experimental, it was stated on the site
13:02:56 <strcat[m]> I still want people to interpret "new" as meaning not very polished / battle tested
13:15:28 <entry1[m]> <strcat[m] "@room https://news.ycombinator.c"> You replied and countered everything he wrote. That is class right there and you didn't even have to insult him like he did to you, I have no clue why the user wouldn't address it in this room that you would have gladly answered his concerns in here considering you are very active. Thank you for your patience and guarding the project.
13:16:18 <strcat[m]> if someone wants to help me with auditing /r reviewing code and documenting things we need to change + figuring out how to change them + changing them
13:16:21 <strcat[m]> they are more than welcome to do that
13:16:55 <strcat[m]> if someone wants to help me figure out how we should handle the SUPL fallback when location services are enabled + there's a mobile network + carrier does not provide the servers
13:16:57 <strcat[m]> I welcome help on that
13:17:01 <strcat[m]> we have to provide it
13:17:05 <strcat[m]> it's required for emergency calls
13:17:18 <strcat[m]> we could set it in a mode where it only works for that if it isn't already
13:17:31 <strcat[m]> can already be seen that it DOES NOT make any connections from the OS though
13:17:41 <strcat[m]> it is a carrier configured feature on the radio
13:18:03 <strcat[m]> we could override what the carrier wants
13:18:11 <strcat[m]> but generally it's supposed to use their server
13:18:22 <strcat[m]> after all... they know about their network best
13:18:46 <strcat[m]> I do not think that it's possible to provide the expected quality based on something like a public cell id db
13:18:53 <strcat[m]> I don't think even Google can do it
13:19:07 <strcat[m]> that is just a fallback
13:20:09 <strcat[m]> and I'm sorry for giving nuanced responses and not running a regex over the code removing references to google.com that are not problematic
13:20:23 <strcat[m]> this is a long term project
13:20:33 <strcat[m]> we had to revive it after a disaster in mid 2018
13:21:02 <strcat[m]> an ongoing one btw
13:23:26 <the-real-johndoe> Does the pixel 5 have security benefits over the 4a/4a 5g
13:23:45 <strcat> the-real-johndoe: Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 are essentially the same phone
13:24:27 <the-real-johndoe> Oh rip i meant just the 4a
13:24:52 <the-real-johndoe> * Does the pixel 5 have security benefits over the 4a
13:25:06 <strcat> the-real-johndoe: slightly, yeah
13:25:22 <strcat> the-real-johndoe: 4a (5G) and 5 are a newer generation than the 4a
13:25:28 <strcat> both are slightly better
13:25:39 <strcat> but 4a (5G) / 5 are the same phone in terms of security
13:26:00 <strcat> same SoC, same components other than battery/touchscreen
13:26:23 <strcat> you could easily run the same OS build on both and it'd just use a diff touchscreen driver on 1
13:26:36 <strcat> (it's not how we want to do things, rather than specialized hardened builds, but it'd be entirely possible)
13:28:53 <dumbirc> anybody here
13:29:01 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
13:29:19 <take_a_deep_brea> there are quiet a lot of people and the channel is active
13:29:19 <dumbirc> oh great ...
13:29:45 <dumbirc> im new to irc
13:30:38 <the-real-johndoe> <strcat "the-real-johndoe: slightly, yeah"> Hmm okay okay im asking this because i actually wanted to buy the 4a (mostly because of the headphone jack) but idk if it is a good tradeoff. Headphone jack > security sound a bit dumb to me.
13:30:46 <take_a_deep_brea> understandable , just ask whatever you want to about graphene OS , we dont stand on ceremony here ; p
13:32:06 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: you can still use wired headphones via USB-C on a Pixel 5 and can charge it wirelessly at the same time
13:32:29 <strcat[m]> imo the reason to get a 4a is cost
13:32:43 <strcat[m]> the 4a (5G) / 5 aren't a big improvement for security, just an incremental one in certain ways
13:33:35 <strcat[m]> certain things are also a mixed bag
13:33:48 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5 uses 4.19 LTS kernel branch, Pixel 4a uses 4.14
13:33:51 <strcat[m]> 4.14 isn't necessarily worse
13:33:55 <strcat[m]> it has lower attack surface / complexity
13:34:29 <strcat[m]> long term have to keep upgrading the LTS branch
13:34:35 <strcat[m]> ideally all devices would be on the same one
13:34:37 <strcat[m]> regardless of what it is
13:34:46 <strcat[m]> for ease of development for us
13:34:54 <the-real-johndoe> <strcat[m] "the-real-johndoe: you can still "> Oh really, i didn't even know wired headphones via USB-C existed. Probably because all the companies are marketing Bluetooth headphones
13:34:56 <strcat[m]> the way it works atm is Linux does 1 LTS per year
13:35:21 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: wired USB-C headphones exist, and the phone also comes with a DAC to attach analog headphones
13:35:33 <strcat[m]> could just leave them attached to the headphone cable
13:35:38 <strcat[m]>  * could just leave it attached to the headphone cable
13:35:44 <strcat[m]> it works with a laptop, etc. too
13:35:54 <strcat[m]> it's not Pixel specific in any way just a generic digital USB-C audio DAC
13:36:05 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: note that Pixels only have digital USB-C audio though
13:36:10 <strcat[m]> headphones need to have a DAC in them
13:40:08 <the-real-johndoe> Thanks for the info and helping me decide to pick a phone! I going to make a donation for the project this week!
13:41:34 <strcat[m]> so a good way to look for headphones might be looking for ones made for use with a macbook
13:43:21 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: there are not a *lot* of USB-C headphones but there are some good ones
13:43:31 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: the issue is just that there is a major trend to wireless and then the more traditional ones
13:43:55 <strcat[m]> and also there are stuff a lot of USB-A / USB 2.0 headphones
13:44:02 <strcat[m]>  * and also there are still a lot of USB-A / USB 2.0 headphones
13:44:22 <strcat[m]> so sennheiser has a bunch that are unfortunately still USB-A
13:44:48 <strcat[m]> they actually have some really nice ones and you'd get better sound than with an analog cable because they give you a nice DAC
13:44:56 <strcat[m]> for whatever reason it largely hasn't migrated to USB-C yet
13:45:24 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: I'd expect that what an audiophile would do regardless is have a USB-C DAC that's high quality and then plug in their fancy headphones
13:45:38 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: can do that on any phone, USB-C just has standard digital audio support
13:45:54 <tidria[m]> there are some decent OTG DACs that are USB-C to 3.5mm though it may not be the solution everyone wants
13:46:35 <strcat[m]> the nice thing about it is you can actually hear what people are saying in movies
13:46:47 <strcat[m]> the DACs that come in phones are pretty garbage
13:47:18 <strcat[m]> digital USB-C audio means it's entirely up to the external DAC / headphones (usually the DAC is just part of the headphones)
13:47:44 <tidria[m]> agreed, there are some slick OTGs that even support MQA, its pretty good from the audiophile vantage point
13:47:57 <alex-resist> Would USB-A headphones work via the USB C<->USB A adapter?
13:48:11 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: probably but that'd be awkward
13:48:25 <strcat[m]> I mean you can literally plug a mouse into your phone
13:48:26 <alex-resist> Yeah, mechanical stress
13:48:27 <strcat[m]> and use a phone cursor
13:48:28 <strcat[m]> try it lol
13:48:44 <strcat[m]> you can use USB ethernet, etc.
13:48:47 <alex-resist> I've used a mouse and even an external Thinkpad keyboard with Trackpoint. Works reasonably well
13:49:19 <strcat[m]> it is awkward on the tiny screen
13:49:26 <strcat[m]> and it's not in the keyboard/mouse focused mode for the UI
13:49:29 <strcat[m]> which does exist
13:49:35 <strcat[m]> keyboard works well
13:49:41 <strcat[m]> mouse... less well
13:50:32 <the-real-johndoe> <strcat[m] "I mean you can literally plug a "> Can a mouse that is infected with some kind of malware affect grapheneOS
13:51:06 <strcat[m]> well a mouse can certainly be infected with malware
13:51:14 <strcat[m]> and it could try to exploit the OS, but we harden against that kind of thing
13:51:26 <strcat[m]> FYI you're supposed to update mouse firmware
13:51:27 <strcat[m]> lol
13:51:36 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
13:51:39 <the-real-johndoe> xD
13:51:48 <strcat[m]> fwupd can update logitech mice instead of using their software
13:52:18 <strcat[m]> in the future I expect a lot of hardware uses WebUSB for firmware updates
13:52:32 <strcat[m]> i.e. visit vendor's site
13:52:44 <strcat[m]> give access to the product you got from them
13:52:44 <the-real-johndoe> Im asking becuz last week a Nigerian prince sended me a box with a mouse in it
13:52:47 <strcat[m]> and it sends it an update which it'd ideally verify with a pubkey
13:53:21 <strcat[m]> and then alternatively gets it via OS
13:54:04 <alex-resist> Could WebUSB do some form of signature verification for GrapheneOS in the future?
13:56:03 <take_a_deep_brea> i wonder wether we could augment current webUSb installer to ba able to sideload an update ?
14:05:06 <take_a_deep_brea> nvm i dont think this will have any advantages
14:05:14 <take_a_deep_brea>  * nvm, i dont think this will have any advantages
14:11:34 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I mean the releases come from the same infra as the WebUSB installer itself
14:11:48 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so... it can't really do anything to further verify
14:11:57 <strcat[m]> unless you mean shipping it outside of our site
14:11:58 <somenerd[m]> And the js as well
14:12:03 <strcat[m]> like having a zip download with the web installer
14:12:05 <strcat[m]> which is itself signed
14:12:11 <strcat[m]> and then verifies the signify signature of releases
14:12:17 <somenerd[m]> So a malicious server could fake a check ig
14:12:26 <strcat[m]> but then you up needing people to verify the web installer with signify and unzip it
14:12:28 <strcat[m]> and open that in a browser
14:12:40 <strcat[m]> so, it has become a partial CLI thing again
14:13:04 <strcat[m]> it could 100% work as a locally opened file
14:13:15 <strcat[m]> we'd need to adjust the releases server config probably
14:13:18 <strcat[m]> CORS
14:13:56 <alex-resist> strcat perhaps a conventionally installed GrapheneOS could verify the OS download, which could then be used by the webUSB installer. But I don't know if that's possible, as that would require components outside the browser
14:14:26 <alex-resist> Also the installer could be malicious, of course. So yeah maybe it's pointless :)
14:15:21 <alex-resist> I guess that's essentially what you said above
14:15:30 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: we could just make an app
14:15:35 <strcat[m]> that includes the WebUSB installer in a WebView
14:15:46 <strcat[m]> we could bundle an app with GrapheneOS for installing GrapheneOS on more devices
14:15:59 <strcat[m]> or make it available in our first party repository that we plan to make
14:16:08 <strcat[m]> and then it'd be able to have a chain of trust from the existing GrapheneOS sure
14:16:15 <alex-resist> That sounds like a good idea
14:16:19 <take_a_deep_brea> that sounds  cool
14:16:35 <alex-resist> However that app would also be present on unverified GrapheneOS installations, so people might confuse the status of their own phones
14:16:59 <strcat[m]> you can use Auditor
14:17:25 <take_a_deep_brea> perhaps not bundling it and just making it available as an apk would be better
14:17:27 <somenerd[m]> >and then it'd be able to have a chain of trust from the existing GrapheneOS sure
14:17:27 <somenerd[m]> Sounds like a good idea
14:17:30 <alex-resist> Ok, perhaps audited GrapheneOS would enable that app (or remove a warning) and automatically(?) give the freshly installed OS also verified status
14:17:33 <somenerd[m]> Easier upgrading
14:17:43 <somenerd[m]> Maybe integrate a backup?
14:17:49 <somenerd[m]> Or transfer?
14:31:47 <Joe99> Hi, I have just installed grapheneOS on Pixal 4a. Everything is good except I can't get notification dots on icons to work. I have the setting enabled. Any suggestions?
14:33:54 <strcat[m]> Joe99: home settings -> press notification dots -> grant it access
14:33:59 <strcat[m]> we could probably set something to grant it by default
14:34:05 <strcat[m]> pull request for that welcome
14:37:02 <Joe99> Thanks for the reply! Enjoy your day!
14:48:03 <refraction[m]> Not sure if it is a common issue, but has anyone been experiencing freezing and reboots whenever unplugging a USB device?
14:51:21 <qwewerert[m]> I have a question for this room; anyone can answer.
14:51:38 <qwewerert[m]> What will GrapheneOS do about push notifications?
14:52:14 <qwewerert[m]> I don't want Daniel Micay or anyone else to make any security compromises in GrapheneOS whatsoever. I think it's only logical to not allow microG as CalyxOS is allowing.
14:52:45 <somenerd[m]> Plan to make a compat layer
14:52:56 <somenerd[m]> That acts as if google servers are offline
14:53:05 <qwewerert[m]> However, for certain apps that people may need in a work environment that have no alternative, and that only have in their source code the Google push notifications, it really hurts work not to have push notifications with GrapheneOS
14:53:07 <somenerd[m]> May make apps use another notif system
14:53:25 <qwewerert[m]> Which ones are available that are FOSS?
14:54:09 <qwewerert[m]> Oh I see -- so you're planning to make a compability later for the push notifications?
14:55:05 <strcat[m]> yes but push notifications do work fine in apps not sending them via Google servers
14:55:14 <strcat[m]>  * yes but push notifications do work fine in apps supporting not sending them via Google servers
14:55:18 <strcat[m]> they can support both FCM and non-FCM push
14:55:22 <strcat[m]> a bunch of apps do both
14:55:27 <strcat[m]> some things simply can't use FCM push
14:55:50 <strcat[m]> how do you use FCM push with arbitrary email servers? you can do push via IMAP IDLE, but random email servers can't push notices of new messages via FCM
14:55:59 <qwewerert[m]> I installed GrapheneOS, and set everything up properly, and I was completely pleased with everything it has to offer. Even the default keyboard replacement and other design features were absolutely perfect. The one thing it did not have that is a complete road-block was the push notification system.
14:56:19 <qwewerert[m]> If I can't get timely ProtonMail push notifications, for example, I can't do what I do effectively.
14:56:29 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: push works on GrapheneOS when app devs choose to not only support Google servers for push
14:56:50 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: push works for email with simply IMAP using a client that supports using IMAP IDLE (IMAP's standard push implementation)
14:56:56 <strcat[m]> there are email clients available with that
14:57:03 <strcat[m]> FairEmail is one, there are lots of others
14:57:35 <strcat[m]> I'd question why a supposedly privacy-focused email provider only supports push via a third party service requiring deeply integrated proprietary services
14:57:49 <somenerd[m]> Yeah wonder why
14:57:53 <strcat[m]> Gmail has push without FCM btw
14:57:56 <strcat[m]> lol

14:58:01 <qwewerert[m]> None of the other options are best. It would be terrible to just change the entire email infrastructure to get push notifications to work properly.
14:58:03 <somenerd[m]> Especially if they’re marketed as an alternative
14:58:04 <mynacol[m]> lol
14:58:11 <somenerd[m]> >Gmail has push without FCM btw
14:58:11 <somenerd[m]> LOL
14:58:14 <strcat[m]> like if you use FairEmail with Gmail
14:58:16 <strcat[m]> it has push
14:58:24 <qwewerert[m]> Proton Technologies AG is a company all about privacy, they're working on their own push notification system, but even they are having trouble producing one that doesn't drain the battery and is scalable to more than 4 million users.
14:58:31 <m2tu[m]> u think this is functionable for os11 ar old code from -10
14:58:33 <strcat[m]> a normal email server has IMAP IDLE
14:58:44 <strcat[m]> if you simply run dovecot even on something ancient like RHEL or Debian stable
14:58:46 <qwewerert[m]> I don't use Gmail, and a lot of the people who care about privacy using GrapheneOS don't use about Gmail either
14:58:46 <strcat[m]> it has push
14:59:04 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: what I'm saying is that even Google supports push for email without Google Play services
14:59:24 <qwewerert[m]> I do understand what you mean.
14:59:29 <strcat[m]> you should be asking protonmail why they don't offer push without FCM
14:59:33 <strcat[m]> we don't make that app
14:59:38 <strcat[m]> we can't implement it for them
14:59:50 <strcat[m]> there is absolutely nothing we can do to make their app have push that doesn't use FCM if that's all they provide
15:00:05 <qwewerert[m]> Protonmail is just 1 example, there are dozens of other applications that many rely on for work that will never offer non-FCM push notifications
15:00:11 <strcat[m]> their server sends push notifications via Google servers
15:00:20 <qwewerert[m]> Because they would be catering to a niche audience and there's no monetary incentive for them to do so.
15:00:26 <qwewerert[m]> Fighting that battle is a losing battle.
15:00:29 <strcat[m]> okay well we're never having built-in FCM
15:00:48 <strcat[m]> they could choose to provide an alternate FCM implementation in their app if they insist on using FCM
15:00:48 <mynacol[m]> qwewerert: Thats always the app's fault. Or Google for not providing a standard API in android.
15:00:56 <qwewerert[m]> I don't want you to have any FCM code
15:00:56 <strcat[m]> or they could use non-FCM push when the OS doesn't have FCM
15:01:11 <strcat[m]> okay so we can't do anything then, the app / server uses FCM
15:01:13 <mynacol[m]>  * qwewerert: It's always the app's fault. Or Google for not providing a standard API in android.
15:01:17 <qwewerert[m]> I don't want you to make any compromises whatsoever, I completely agree with you
15:01:37 <qwewerert[m]> But there has to be some sort of work-around someone can think of to get these apps to work with push notifications beyond the way that MicroG is doing it
15:01:37 <strcat[m]> it's not a compromise but rather we are not including a proprietary push notification or other proprietary services like that in the OS
15:01:39 <strcat[m]> it belongs in apps
15:01:43 <qwewerert[m]> One that can be used in GrapheneOS
15:01:50 <mynacol[m]> qwewerert: Then go with this knowledge to apps that don't provide an alternative
15:01:53 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: yes, the app devs can implement non-FCM push
15:02:05 <strcat[m]> or they can provide an FCM implementation themselves if they insist on using it
15:02:13 <strcat[m]> both options, 2nd option doesn't make much sense
15:02:14 <strcat[m]> but is possibler
15:02:18 <strcat[m]>  * but is possible
15:02:27 <strcat[m]>  * both are options, 2nd option doesn't make much sense
15:02:38 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: you're asking the wrong people to implement it
15:02:43 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: go ask the protonmail people
15:02:44 <strcat[m]> not us
15:02:55 <strcat[m]> we don't make that app, or more importantly their server
15:03:12 <strcat[m]> if their server only does push via FCM there is not way to get push notifications from it another way
15:03:20 <strcat[m]>  * if their server only does push via FCM there is no way to get push notifications from it another way
15:03:35 <strcat[m]> I think you're not understanding what push is and how it works
15:03:40 <qwewerert[m]> It's not just ProtonMail, it's many other companies in certain sectors.
15:03:42 <qwewerert[m]> To compell the devs of at least a dozen large corporations to do so would require a dramatic uptick in GrapheneOS usage, in my estimation. There has to be an audience for it.
15:03:46 <strcat[m]> the server pushes data through a connection to the client
15:04:00 <strcat[m]> if they use FCM, they push it to the client THROUGH Google servers
15:04:04 <qwewerert[m]> I do, I've looked into it, and how MicroG works also
15:04:06 <strcat[m]> their server talks to Google, not the client
15:04:24 <strcat[m]> okay so then you are aware we are not capable of making their server + app do it another way
15:04:25 <strcat[m]> only they are
15:04:58 <mynacol[m]> qwewerert: It's still the app developers fault for depending on FCM. With the whole Huawei thing more and more phones don't have FCM.
15:04:58 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: the 'compromise' that you're talking about will also never work reliably or keep working after major upgrades / app upgrades
15:05:31 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: we're far from the only AOSP-based OS without Play services
15:05:43 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: they are missing out on a substantial audience by not supporting it
15:05:52 <qwewerert[m]> I agree
15:06:02 <qwewerert[m]> What are we going to do about it? What can I do?
15:06:10 <strcat[m]> so a 'dramatic uptick in GrapheneOS usage' is in no way required to push app devs to do anything
15:06:17 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: go ask the app developers for push support
15:06:17 <mynacol[m]> qwewerert: Go to protonmail and complain
15:06:18 <strcat[m]> send them emails
15:06:40 <qwewerert[m]> But there has to be a coordinated campaign. Just one person doing it isn't going to do anything.
15:06:52 <strcat[m]> okay but a coordinated campaign involves many individuals doing it
15:07:02 <strcat[m]> so you should start
15:07:04 <qwewerert[m]> There have to be some common frameworks or methods for doing it. It's too inventive for app developers to just have to figure out their own way
15:07:15 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: there is little to figure out, really
15:07:18 <strcat[m]> it's not that complicated
15:07:37 <strcat[m]> it's harder to align things vertically with CSS
15:07:48 <strcat[m]> I can spend 10 minutes writing a little demo of what push is
15:07:48 <qwewerert[m]> Some ways are more effective than others
15:07:50 <zvl12[m]> VPN question : is there any added value having a VPN on all the time ? not only for surfing, but I am mainly using the phone for Wifi Calling (via Tmob).
15:07:58 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: okay for example, with email
15:08:03 <strcat[m]> the standard IMAP protocol for fetching email
15:08:07 <strcat[m]> it has push support standardized
15:08:11 <strcat[m]> called IMAP IDLE
15:08:23 <strcat[m]> all IMAP servers that are not trash support it
15:08:23 <qwewerert[m]> @strcat:matrix.org:
15:08:30 <strcat[m]> a normal email server supports push
15:08:43 <strcat[m]> they don't have push support because they did something harder by not using an existing protocol
15:09:16 <strcat[m]> I used the example of Gmail because you have Google themselves supporting push on GrapheneOS for email
15:09:26 <strcat[m]> but a privacy-focused email provider requires FCM + Google Play services
15:09:37 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
15:12:08 <qwewerert[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: There are also proprietary messaging apps used by organizations in different sectors (law enforcement, medicine/healthcare, environmental health, sanitation, offshore oil), there's Signal, Wire, non-privacy apps like WhatsApp, Outlook... All of those for many people their jobs depend on using those apps.
15:12:31 <strcat[m]> push literally just means you open a TCP connection, and leave it open
15:12:32 <qwewerert[m]> I do get your point when it comes to ProtonMail and these other privacy-focused companies
15:12:37 <strcat[m]> and when the server has events to give the client
15:12:43 <strcat[m]> it sends them down the connection
15:12:46 <strcat[m]> it used to be called 'long polling'
15:12:50 <strcat[m]> 'push' is a trendier name
15:13:07 <qwewerert[m]> But to maintain a persistent connection requires a lot of battery consumption, or it would at least appear that way
15:13:13 <strcat[m]> no
15:13:14 <strcat[m]> it doesn't
15:13:17 <strcat[m]> that's literally what FCM does
15:13:38 <qwewerert[m]> Yes I do know that, it's a centralized manner of handling it
15:13:38 <strcat[m]> there is no battery cost to keeping a connection open, zero, but you do need to occasionally wake up to check if it died
15:13:49 <strcat[m]> on IPv6 it is quite efficient because it generally shouldn't be dying
15:13:54 <qwewerert[m]> That's what I mean, the pings/packets to keep it alive
15:13:58 <strcat[m]> you can listen for network change events
15:14:05 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: you need to send a ping like every 15 minutes
15:14:07 <strcat[m]> on IPv6
15:14:24 <qwewerert[m]> But if you multiply that by several million users it becomes problematic
15:14:29 <strcat[m]> and if apps use the same timer the OS schedules them all together
15:14:32 <qwewerert[m]> So convincing a company to do that is difficult
15:14:36 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: not really
15:14:40 <strcat[m]> that's not why they don't do it
15:14:55 <qwewerert[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: Do tell me more
15:15:19 <strcat[m]> do you think most of these apps you are talking about have even considered whether the app works without Play services?
15:15:22 <strcat[m]> and they depend on it for more than FCM
15:15:45 <strcat[m]> if they want the app to work without Play
15:15:53 <strcat[m]> implementing push is not that much work
15:16:02 <strcat[m]> it is really pretty trivial to implement
15:16:14 <strcat[m]> it's a day of work for someone that knows Android development and basic networking
15:16:17 <strcat[m]> 1 day of work for 1 dev
15:16:23 <strcat[m]> now compare that to something like say
15:16:32 <strcat[m]> implementing machine-learning based image recognition
15:17:12 <strcat[m]> implementing an equivalent to FCM for an app is not a big project
15:17:15 <qwewerert[m]> So say you're me, and you have a proprietary messaging app your company relies upon (and if you approach the c-levels with what we're talking about, in order for you to use GrapheneOS, you're labeled as a paranoid cooke), so you approach the company that makes the messaging app.
15:17:15 <qwewerert[m]> What would you yourself say to convince them to provide a non-FCM option?
15:17:32 <strcat[m]> you mean, a non Play services options?
15:17:40 <strcat[m]>  * you mean, a non Play services option?
15:17:45 <qwewerert[m]> Just for push notifications, yes
15:17:47 <strcat[m]> FCM is one tiny part of Play services
15:18:10 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: so you're telling me the app works fine without Play services in every other way and the developers are testing that and keeping it working
15:18:23 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: but they cannot be bothered to do a push implementation? sounds like something is wrong
15:18:53 <qwewerert[m]> Yes, the app works just fine, the only thing that doesn't work are push notifications, which is the very thing that it needs to function as a messaging app
15:19:05 <qwewerert[m]> Say your job is dependent on those push notifications
15:19:29 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: either get them to switch messaging systems or get the messaging app to implement it
15:19:32 <strcat[m]> has nothing to do with us
15:19:36 <strcat[m]> I don't see what we could possibly do
15:19:48 <strcat[m]> seems off-topic for this channel
15:19:51 <qwewerert[m]> For instance, in healthcare, if you're working as a nurse, a patient's life might depend on timely pushes (I'm not a nurse)
15:19:54 <strcat[m]> don't think it's going anywhere
15:19:57 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: ok
15:20:01 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: so either the app dev implements it
15:20:04 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: or you use another app
15:20:11 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: the conversation can end there
15:20:14 <qwewerert[m]> I'm thankful for the time you spent explaining it to me, it makes sense
15:20:54 <qwewerert[m]> I think though that that's what may hold a lot of people like myself back from GrapheneOS - who will respect and recommend it, but can't use it on a work phone, only on a personal one
15:22:18 <mynacol[m]> qwewerert: If you write to app developers you can throw in OpenPush as alternative: https://github.com/UnifiedPush/android-connector
15:22:29 <qwewerert[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: Is there a sample of code somewhere of a recommended way to do this that I can send to the DEvs?
15:22:44 <qwewerert[m]> That's exactly what I was going to ask, thanks a lot
15:22:53 <mynacol[m]> Only one way to do it
15:24:29 <qwewerert[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: mynacol : Is OpenPush similar to UnifiedPush? Are both options equal?
15:24:42 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: when Play services is unavailable, make a foreground service, keep open connection to their server through it, and use an OS timer to wake and deal with it
15:24:50 <strcat[m]> and listen for network change events to deal with those separately
15:24:51 <mynacol[m]> Sry it is UnifiedPush /:
15:25:03 <strcat[m]> and adjust the timer based on the reliability of the connection particularly for IPv6 where it should work better
15:25:19 <mynacol[m]>  * qwewerert: If you write to app developers you can throw in UnifiedPush as alternative: https://github.com/UnifiedPush/android-connector
15:25:25 <strcat[m]> and ask user for battery optimization exception
15:25:36 <strcat[m]> FCM has one built into the OS on an OS with Play services
15:25:38 <strcat[m]> this is how it works
15:25:52 <strcat[m]> the phone gets a message over this connection when asleep and it wakes to handle it
15:26:29 <mynacol[m]> Yes the names OpenPush and UnifiedPush are used for the same technology 🙈
15:31:03 <qwewerert[m]> @strcat:matrix.org:  Thanks for the breakdown
15:31:32 <qwewerert[m]> So if I were approaching a dev, I'll tell them about this method this way. Should I point to UnifiedPush and OpenPush for code samples?
15:31:55 <strcat[m]> mynacol: sound like diff things
15:33:02 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: doesn't sound actively developed and it's way more complicated than what an app needs to do this themselves
15:33:11 <strcat[m]> they don't need some fancy federated system where users pick a push service
15:33:16 <strcat[m]> qwewerert: it is not complicated
15:33:30 <qwewerert[m]> I see what you mean
15:33:55 <qwewerert[m]> Is there like a ready-made code method, or an app whose code I could point to for implementation?
15:34:35 <strcat[m]> dunno
15:34:44 <strcat[m]> I know how I would do it myself but I'm not going to spend my time on
15:34:50 <strcat[m]>  * I know how I would do it myself but I'm not going to spend my time on that
15:34:53 <strcat[m]> don't have a use for it
15:35:41 <qwewerert[m]> I see, thanks for the insight, however
15:38:28 <qwewerert[m]> There's so much to offer by using GrapheneOS, has its own malloc and other security features. I think this is the real challenge of getting people on-board and convincing them to use it. It's fine for people who only use like 4 main apps.
15:39:29 <qwewerert[m]> Lots of companies are adopting a dark mode into their apps. Hopefully they'll do the same for push notifications if the demand is high.
15:40:25 <strcat> sure so start pestering them and getting others to do it
15:40:28 <strcat> bother them not us
15:40:29 <strcat> please
15:40:34 <strcat> it's their app with the issue
15:41:06 <nscnt[m]> There are apps with a fallback. It's not magic. GrapheneOS is not responsible for how an app is developed.
15:41:17 <zvl12[m]> <zvl12[m] "VPN question : is there any adde"> I am sorry to push again that question, not sure if browser ecluded, there is any advantage using a VPN
15:44:05 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
15:44:30 <zvl12[m]> <nscnt[m] "There are apps with a fallback. "> this is why it would be good to have somewhere some kind of app list "approved for GOS", myself very careful installing anything that could be a nuisance or counterproductive
15:46:13 <qwewerert[m]> @zvl12: https://plexus.techlore.tech attempts to do this, but unfortunately they sometimes don't distinguish the features that don't work in the CSV file on GitHub
15:47:48 <qwewerert[m]> https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/src/data/Plexus.csv
15:51:50 <brenneke[m]> <qwewerert[m] "What are we going to do about it"> Stop giving them money and tell them why.
15:56:17 <qwewerert[m]> brenneke: That may be somewhat persuasive with some smaller companies, but for most that would mean they would just be out of a job. It's a bit impractical to do that for a half dozen main apps. I agree with you, however I think there should be some coordinated campaign rather than on an individ level.
15:58:16 <qwewerert[m]> Doing it anonymously is even harder.
15:59:03 <qwewerert[m]> Just obtaining a Pixel phone with an unlockable bootloader anonymously took a lot of resources, let alone approaching the devs in these companies
16:05:21 <Albakham[m]> Yubikeys work on GrapheneOS? Better to use NFC or USB-C?
16:05:32 <Albakham[m]>  * Do Yubikeys work on GrapheneOS? Better to use NFC or USB-C?
16:10:47 <Wonderfall[m]> It works well, I have no issues with USB-C. But unfortunately U2F implementation in apps and Chromium rely on Play Services atm.
16:11:59 <zvl12[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "It works well, I have no issues "> this means there is no use of Yubikeys on GOS ? Or for some stuff yes ?
16:12:43 <Wonderfall[m]> Well you can use still use a Yubikey for other stuff (OTP for instance, if you want that)
16:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> Albakham[m]: Yubikeys work on GrapheneOS if the app supports them by both NFC and USB, so if you have an app like OpenKeyChain (yeah, I know, don't use PGP and all...) they are tested and working. However, U2F is not functioning in Vanadium at this moment due to U2F on the stock android OS being handled via a play services library, and it must be done via WebUSB.
16:17:34 <strcat> it'd be a lot simpler for us to implement a U2F/FIDO2 implementation via the HSM
16:17:37 <strcat> the HSM supports it
16:17:45 <strcat> it has 1 bit confirmation via physical button
16:18:00 <strcat> and has full support of what's needed for U2F/FIDO2
16:19:01 <Albakham[m]> okay thanks
16:19:29 <TheJollyRoger> Albakham[m]: because some aspects of Play Services are invasive, GrapheneOS will not include it.
16:19:55 <Albakham[m]> hell yeah, I don't want play services ;)
16:20:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr
16:26:32 <strcat[m]> if it wasn't invasive
16:26:35 <strcat[m]> it would work as a user installed app
16:26:51 <strcat[m]> the EU should just make them do that
16:27:07 <strcat[m]> and make them support everything it does for other alternatives
16:27:26 <strcat[m]> anti-competitive to have them get all these vendors to bundle it and restrict functionality to it
16:30:18 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
16:43:50 <Blackbeard> @TheJollyRoger: (off-topic, but how did you add the comment in italics?)
16:45:15 <TheJollyRoger> Blackbeard: you can add the italics and show your nickname in the channel buffer by prefacing what you're about to send with the "/me" command. Go ahead and try it in the offtopic channel.
17:01:27 <spamx101[m]> Is there any work being done ATM by devs (GrapheneOS or other outside parties) to provide U2F/FIDO2 support without relying on play services? Would people consider this a useful and important function or under a more "frivolous feature" category?
17:02:36 <strcat> spamx101[m]: it would be useful to implement a way to do that for Vanadium
17:02:56 <strcat> could be done as a library usable by other applications
17:03:06 <strcat> or it could be an app + library
17:03:35 <TheJollyRoger> spamx101[m]: it would be extremely useful, U2F is very secure authentication technology and currently that's a bit of a weak link in establishing trust between client and server.
17:08:54 <spamx101[m]> strcat: Thanks; I believe I understand that important distinction now between support for Vanadium specifically as a browser app versus support for other applications. So is there work addressing this ATM or any plans to?
17:09:03 <spamx101[m]> TheJollyRoger: I understand and thus glad that it's the case that you would consider it extreemly useful and relevant. I own a pair of Yubikeys ATM (one as backup) and have been wanting to start using them for U2F/FIDO2 in addition to OTP for whatever doesn't support U2F/FIDO2 yet, but I did not realize there was not support for this in Android *without* play services. Quite unfortunate.
17:10:39 <TheJollyRoger> spamx101[m]: Well... right now the developers are really attending to much more pressing and urgent matters, bear in mind that people at OEMs are usually paid $150,000 to do what the GrapheneOS developers are doing out of altruism. The issue's open on our issue tracker, we're hoping that someone else might contribute and maintain the code for it.
17:10:51 <strcat[m]> spamx101: well if we implement a generic way to do it
17:10:52 <strcat[m]> and publish it
17:10:58 <strcat[m]> it doesn't mean any app devs will adopt it
17:10:59 <strcat[m]> other than us
17:11:22 <TheJollyRoger> Either that, or with enough donations, it might be possible to put a "code bounty" on it, which is an approach that actually worked very well in the past.
17:13:21 <spamx101[m]> Understood; makes sense. Thank you both. I won't bother y'all more on the matter right now and will look for the open issue and keep an eye on it.
17:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> spamx101[m]: Sure. Usually the issue tracker's the best place to check for planned or desired features, usually that's where we put things like enhancements, planned features, the wishlist...
17:15:56 <strcat[m]> Vanadium is not really one of our focuses yet
17:16:05 <strcat[m]> we have a lot of other base OS stuff to work on
17:17:03 <spamx101[m]> TheJollyRoger: Yes, sorry for taking up mental energy here - I just thought I could follow up quickly with the previous conversation in the thread. Although I seem to be having trouble finding the issue in question searching for "U2F" or "FIDO2" or "2FA", etc... This is the right place, right? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
17:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> spamx101[m]: hey no apologies needed, mate! Yep, that's the issue tracker for the entire GrapheneOS project. Some sub-projects also have their own issue trackers, although generally we try to consolidate them there.

17:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> Just it may take a while.
17:20:37 <spamx101[m]> Ah, got it, makes sense. Thank you!
17:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. GrapheneOS is a pretty large project as a whole, but it contains lots of little sub-projects that all come together under the GrapheneOS umbrella. Vanadium is one of them.
17:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> AttestationServer and Auditor, Vanadium, hardened bionic, hardened allocator, the hardened kernels, etc.
17:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> So too, does Vanadium have its own subprojects: its implementation of the Secure PDF Viewer is also a part of Vanadium since Vanadium provides the sandboxing for it.
17:23:22 <spamx101[m]> Yup, it's my bad for not looking under Vanadium too. I was still thinking for the OS as a whole versus also just the feature for Vanadium specifically in this case as strcat graciously explained.
17:23:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it can get a little confusing from time to time!
17:24:10 <spamx101[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So too, does Vanadium have its o"> Oh, I did not know that. Quite interesting!
17:25:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Really neat stuff!
17:25:30 <blu_g5> Hi all, I'm here after two days of not finding an answer. I'm trying to install graphene on a cheap blu g5 phone. I can't unlock the flashing. I haven't been able to find a solution or a work around. Can anyone help point me in a direction?
17:25:30 <blu_g5> fastboot flashing unlock
17:25:31 <blu_g5> FAILED (remote: 'Not implemet.')
17:25:31 <blu_g5> fastboot: error: Command failed
17:25:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hello blu_g5, you can't do that, unfortunately. We don't support the Blu G5.
17:26:15 <TheJollyRoger> If you do succeed in flashing it onto the Blu G5, you'll have created yourself an expensive paperweight.
17:26:26 <blu_g5> oh...
17:26:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. The bootloaders are written to be specific to each phone.
17:27:21 <blu_g5> is the pixel 2 the least expensive option I can go with if I return this phone?
17:27:28 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to run GrapheneOS, you'll want to buy a device that GrapheneOS officially supports. Right now, the phone that we consider "best value for the money" is the 4a.
17:27:32 <shibboleth> is adb accessible through graphene recovery?
17:27:45 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: The Pixel 2 is no longer supported. Your best bet is the 4a.
17:27:50 <blu_g5> I see
17:27:51 <blu_g5> Thank you
17:28:00 <blu_g5> I wish I had come on here sooner, but much appreciated
17:28:01 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: We support sideloading OTAs via recovery.
17:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Anytime!
17:28:27 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: I can explain a bit about why this is:
17:29:03 <TheJollyRoger> When Google orders the chips from Qualcomm, they pay Qualcomm for and Qualcomm commits to three years of firmware support. Google in turn, then commits to 3 years of software support.
17:29:08 <shibboleth> yeah, i need to be able to look around /efs as root somehow, is this totally not possible in graphene or graphene recovery?
17:29:53 <TheJollyRoger> That means they continue supplying us with the source code for driver updates for that time. However, once Qualcomm says "Alright, the contract's fulfilled, bye" then essentially, that means Qualcomm will no longer support the device and the SoC becomes insecure.
17:30:06 <TheJollyRoger> After that, there is no point in Google continuing to supply patches to upstream.
17:30:34 <m2tu[m]> which file can i change to prevent GPS tunring on when making system restore ?
17:30:46 <blu_g5> got it, so should I expect a 3 year cycle of renewing phones even if I get a 4a?
17:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> And thus, they force our hand to mark a device as "End of Life" because no matter what we do, the SoC itself will be insecure because Qualcomm is now no longer updating the firmware.
17:30:50 <m2tu[m]> seems its default mode on allways if system is restored
17:31:11 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: App-accessible root is not supported in GrapheneOS, at all.
17:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Yes. It's three years, starting at the day that the phone first appears on the Google Store.
17:31:57 <shibboleth> TheJollyRoger, i'm talking adb or adb in recovery
17:32:19 <blu_g5> TheJollyRoger: thanks,
17:32:25 <blu_g5> very helpful
17:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Google is probably the best at this, they pay Qualcomm for three years of support. Other vendors usually pay for only two, some pay for only one. Some don't even bother negotiating a contract with Qualcomm at all, and simply release insecure handsets with the attitude of "we've got your money now, it's your problem."
17:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> *"we've got your money, now it's your problem."
17:33:39 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: Yes. You shouldn't be able to gain root via adb on GrapheneOS, since we use full production builds rather than release userdebug builds. As for recovery, I've never dealt with that unfortunately, sorry.
17:33:43 <blu_g5> TheJollyRoger: last question: any particular concerns I should have with purchasing refurbished phones?
17:34:05 <mynacol[m]> <m2tu[m] "which file can i change to preve"> During setup wizard you should be able to enable/disable location.
17:34:31 <PNDMT12345[m]> What's the best method to keep contacts synced with my computer?
17:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Yes. You should be worried about getting ripped off, or worried that the dudes and dudettes being paid eight bucks an hour to sling phones didn't check the labels between which phones are unlockable or not and just threw them all in the same bin.
17:35:32 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Buy refurbished phones at your own peril. Best case scenario, you might get what you paid for. Likely scenario, you might just end up with a carrier locked phone that will not be bootloader unlockable no matter what you do. Worst case scenario, you get a phone with a refurbished or generic whitelabel battery that will be dead soon at best, or short out and wreck your device at worst.
17:35:39 <m2tu[m]> mynacol:  so in setupwizard build file i can edit to to make it unckeked automaticlyy?
17:35:43 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Your safest bet is to buy a phone directly from the Google Store.
17:36:04 <TheJollyRoger> blu_g5: Order it new, unlocked and carrier agnostic. You will have the option to choose.
17:36:50 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: if you need to extract files from the GrapheneOS system image, you should be able to download our system images, decompress them, and mount them as sparse ext4 images.
17:37:47 <shibboleth>  /efs is not in hthe system image
17:38:16 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: Sorry, I won't be able to help you further here, unfortunately. I'm at the end of my knowledge here.
17:40:54 <mynacol[m]> <m2tu[m] "mynacol:  so in setupwizard buil"> idk. But whyy?? What's the problem with GPS? Afaik no data gets transmitted through GPS (the thing the pixels can do)
17:42:02 <qwewerert[m]> The privacy tradeoff with buying it directly from Google is that Google then in turn knows which person is associated with which phone, is it not?
17:42:22 <TheJollyRoger> qwewerert[m]: not really.
17:42:48 <qwewerert[m]> TheJollyRoger: Care to explain?
17:43:23 <TheJollyRoger> qwewerert[m]: Even if they WERE associating the IMEIs or hardware identifiers with the customer purchasing information, they don't have a way to extract those unresettable hardware identifiers from your phone.
17:43:34 <TheJollyRoger> Not without breaking Linux.
17:43:36 <d11263x[m]> if i wanted to  install a messenger like signal or session a  4/5 times on graphene would i need to make a different user account for each messenger app  ?  or this a better way ?  ty in advance.
17:43:53 <d11263x[m]>  * if i wanted to  install a messenger like signal or session a  4/5 times on graphene would i need to make a different user account for each messenger app  ?  or there a better way ?  ty in advance.
17:43:58 <thetranstocommie> Hey I found a bug. Plugged in a physical keyboard with a type c to a adapter, and unplugging that adapter caused a hard crash, which rebooted my entire device.
17:44:18 <m2tu[m]> mynacol:  i try to strip it as much as possible and stuffs i do not use, to get battery and more efficent device
17:44:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hi thetranstocommie, could you file it under the issue tracker?
17:44:52 <TheJollyRoger> qwewerert[m]: Since Android 10, only privileged system apps that are absolutely *necessary* to maintain cell connectivity with the towers can access those nonresettable hardware identifiers, and they do nothing else.
17:45:33 <m2tu[m]> i lose about 1-2% battery over 1 night now from 5-7% before after much edit
17:46:08 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: yes, if you want to have five separate Signal instances operating on your phone concurrently, you will need to install them in five separate user accounts.
17:46:31 <mynacol[m]> m2tu: If you turn off location, you should achieve the same. (In this particular case)
17:46:31 <thetranstocommie> <TheJollyRoger "Hi the trans to commie pipeline,"> doesn't look like its reproducible
17:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: Huh, very strange. If you do figure out how to reproduce it, that's definitely a high-priority issue to file.
17:47:30 <d11263x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "d11263x: yes, if you want to hav"> Thank you for your response.  Do you know what the maximum number of user accounts that can run without the phone crashing or is there a limit set by android ?
17:47:54 <mynacol[m]> d11263x: I think 3 can run at the same time
17:48:16 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: sixteen, the limit is sixteen. In theory, it's possible to run work profiles for each one, but I don't recommend that, because in a work profile, the data in the apps is owned by whatever is managing the work profile (usually the app that controls the work profile), and not you.
17:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> *sixteen total, sorry.
17:48:56 <mynacol[m]> Exist (but not running actively) can 10+ iirc
17:49:01 <TheJollyRoger> mynacol[m]: thanks, sorry, you're right, only a certain number can run at the same time.
17:50:14 <TheJollyRoger> qwewerert[m]: If you order from a reseller, you're instead shifting the trust onto your reseller *and* onto Google. This doesn't shift the trust away from Google, it sure as hell does introduce another third party you have to trust though.
17:51:05 <thetranstocommie> <TheJollyRoger "the trans to commie pipeline: Hu"> I'll report it. it could be a matter of first use of a physical keyboard.

17:57:21 <m2tu[m]> can this be inplentet in pixel devices ??
17:57:57 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: It's legacy and obsolete.
17:58:36 <TheJollyRoger> This arrangement dates back to the days when phones were not encrypted by default and the entire disk was encrypted with only one key, which lived in memory the entire time the phone was on.
17:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't do what you think it does.
17:59:39 <m2tu[m]> ahaaa, i see thanks so much for ur answer
17:59:43 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
18:00:49 <qwewerert[m]> <TheJollyRoger "qwewerert: If you order from a r"> I see, thanks
18:00:53 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: the proper way to do "separate passwords" now, is to do what we suggest on the FAQ, and simply use the owner account to switch the device on and manage profiles, then use a separate profile to do your work in, with a different password for the separate profile. The owner profile is still encrypted, and the files for it are device encrypted.
18:01:44 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: This arrangement allows you to close the second profile when it's not in use, so the files in it can be put at rest and remain encrypted when not in use.
18:02:07 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: going back to the old ways would simply mean the entire phone now needs to be decrypted when it's switched on, no ifs ands or buts.
18:03:18 <d11263x[m]> what is the opinion of the pixel devices itself .  i understand that graphene os is rated highly for its security measures.  but what about on a firmware level for things like the lte modem , wifi , bluetooth, baseband etc.  surely these functions require dozens of proprietary blobs to even work .  How do we know what potential security vulnerabilities exist or possible supply chains backdoors.   I would hate to think
18:03:19 <d11263x[m]> somehow one of these elements could undermine the security that graphene os brings.  I am seriously considering to buy a pixel to install graphene.
18:03:45 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: the Pixels are the best in class for this.
18:04:22 <TheJollyRoger> They are reference devices from Qualcomm and are the best in the industry for IOMMU/SMMU mitigations for isolation of the radios, wifi, SSDs, GPU, that sort of thing, and the drivers for them are all open source.
18:04:37 <TheJollyRoger> That's why we picked them.
18:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> Firmware for them is available even, although you have to ask nicely for them.
18:04:57 <TheJollyRoger> *ask them nicely for it.
18:05:37 * mynacol[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/RDMDCNLOzcvrgzoiKYpwjuNl/message.txt >
18:05:43 <TheJollyRoger> They also have insider access protection, which means an adversary can't confiscate your phone and Google can't issue a rogue update for them that disables the security chip without your password.
18:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> Correction: *firmware sources are available even, although you do have to ask them nicely for it.
18:08:48 <TheJollyRoger> Other vendors don't hold a candle to this. Samsung takes the approach of "we'll just vendor sign everything and if you so much as THINK about doing things your own way, we void your warranty and permanently disable bootloader security features in your phone."
18:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> OnePlus takes the attitude of "Security? Let's look that up in a dictionary, let's see... S... E... K... huh, it's not here."
18:15:14 <d11263x[m]> I have good faith in the pixel and graphene .  Apparently the iPhone was another good contender but i would feel i would never really own the device never mind how lock down it was with its immediate security policies.  another reason why i would rather the graphene / pixel  device is because of the ability to run users accounts meaning multiple messengers wouldn't be an issue.  Ios your just with whatever apple allows

18:17:42 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: yarr, that be the best value for yer gold, matey.
18:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to firmware, I can offer you a few reassurances there:
18:19:09 <TheJollyRoger> First up, the firmware on those elements actually isn't state-carrying, the operating system actually initializes those devices.
18:19:47 <TheJollyRoger> Because the host does firmware initialization, coupled with the device's memory management units, this effectively means the host can control the devices you're worried about.
18:20:09 <TheJollyRoger> It also means that the device can only read and write to the memory that the driver explicitly allows them to.
18:21:39 <TheJollyRoger> Because the host operating system (ie: GrapheneOS) takes care of firmware initialization, this not only means the firmware can be updated to mitigate exploits, but also, with verified boot, it means if those devices DO turn bad, rebooting your phone can restore them to a previous state.

18:24:49 <TheJollyRoger> So it's not like these things are "THE BACKDURR PROSSESSURR!" that people trying to generate buzz and hype often puff them up to be.
18:25:20 <TheJollyRoger> qontinuum[m]1: Are you using the web installer?
18:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> Or the CLI one?
18:25:49 <TheJollyRoger> If fastboot hangs, despite being able to enumerate the device, and unlock the bootloader,
18:26:06 <TheJollyRoger> Then this is usually indicative of one of two things:
18:26:13 <qontinuum[m]1> <TheJollyRoger "Or the CLI one?"> The CLI one
18:26:40 <TheJollyRoger> qontinuum[m]1: does "fastboot devices" list your device once it's plugged in and on fastboot?
18:27:06 <qontinuum[m]1> Yup
18:27:15 <TheJollyRoger> qontinuum[m]1: Ok, I know what the problem is:
18:27:47 <TheJollyRoger> Generally what the issue is that causes this, where fastboot hangs once you start the script tends to be one of two things:
18:28:54 <TheJollyRoger> A) The cable is missing a trace/wire. Most USB cables only do the bare minimum of the functions required by most users for day to day tasks like transferring files or Human Interface Devices, and they don't do anything else. If you're using the Google branded cable, then move to...
18:29:44 <TheJollyRoger> B) Your motherboard's USB port, or your motherboard's firmware support for USB is faulty for the same reasons. Try switching ports because usually the vendors do have at least *one* USB port that's fully traced and supports all the features implemented by USB that fastboot needs.
18:29:51 <TheJollyRoger> If worst comes to worst, try another computer.
18:31:01 <qontinuum[m]1> Okay, going to try this thank you ^^
18:31:43 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck qontinuum[m]1! Thank you for trying out the experimental images - we wholeheartedly encourage you to report any bugs you find that weren't broken before, or if you don't, to let us know that the builds are working.
18:32:18 <TheJollyRoger> It's kinda unfortunate, but we've found a *ton* of vendors are very lackadaisical about fully implementing the USB standard. Most of them don't do such a great job at it.
18:32:58 <TheJollyRoger> (Had one guy a bit back who had the misfortune of having TWO separate computers that had faulty implementations of USB on all their ports... if I recall right he had to borrow a friend's computer and then finally lucked out with that.)
18:33:28 <TheJollyRoger> So it's not your fault, this is typically caused by vendors being lazy.

21:51:04 <d11263x[m]> orbot vs whonix . i am pretty sure whonix would win all day in my opinion.   i would not trust orbot not to leak ip address
21:55:25 <d11263x[m]> timetravelingman:  thumbs down ? i am asking an opinion ? what is the problem ?
21:57:41 <nscnt[m]> Well, it looks like he has made his opinion known
21:58:18 <pnrxa[m]1> This discussion also feels like it would be better in off topic
21:59:24 <d11263x[m]> I dont see how its off topic. i am wanting to know the best way to use graphene anonymously.  or is this not a graphene group / page.
22:00:24 <pnrxa[m]1> More a general question, not GrapheneOS specific
22:01:11 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
22:01:18 <d11263x[m]> So a user can not ask a question unless its specifically on how to configure graphene itself.  ok no problem
22:04:10 <timetravelingman> Bruh if you have a cellphone it isn't anonymous
22:04:29 <timetravelingman> GrapheneOS can't help with making your carrier
22:04:43 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: so, with respect to cellular networks, remember that the connection needs to terminate somewhere, before it gets passed onto the next handling agent that will send your TCP request or route your UDP packets to the next one.
22:04:44 <timetravelingman> Respect your privacy
22:05:08 <TheJollyRoger> If you're using TLS/SSL to connect, such as for instance, let's say you're connecting to grapheneos.org,
22:05:52 <d11263x[m]> <timetravelingman "Bruh if you have a cellphone it "> haha that is your reply.   i clearly stated with the cellular modem disabled.  ( meaning no carrier network is used ) ( wifi only ) is the same as any pc connected through wireless.
22:05:53 <TheJollyRoger> Even though your cellphone connection to either your cell carrier, or perhaps, to to the Starbucks Public Wifi router is done in a security-agnostic way, it's still encrypted.
22:06:11 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: if you lend an ear, I'll answer your question.
22:06:16 <TheJollyRoger> Also!
22:06:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy blacklight447[m]! Good to see you!
22:07:14 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: If you're using Tor to connect to say, for example, GrapheneOS.org,
22:08:19 <TheJollyRoger> even if you're going via a security agnostic protocol, such as your cell carrier, your traffic is still encrypted to the guard, within that, your traffic is still encrypted to your relay, within that, your traffic is still encrypted to your exit, and because GrapheneOS.org enables HTTP Strict Transport Security, it's still encrypted to /us./
22:09:00 <TheJollyRoger> So the cell modem actually matters far less than you think it does.
22:10:05 <d11263x[m]> I %100 know cellular networks are non anonymous.  I  am talking about a graphene pixel connected to a torified wireless network %100 of the time with the cellular modem perma disabled perhaps even physically removed from the phone .
22:10:19 <TheJollyRoger> Certainly, your cellphone provider knows you are using Tor. The same goes for the Starbucks Public Wifi, but they can't actually see what's in it.
22:10:28 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: now you're mixing anonymity modes.
22:10:36 <d11263x[m]> i think that is pretty solid setup  in terms of anonymity combined with graphene security
22:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: Congratulations, you just mixed anonymity modes.
22:11:04 <TheJollyRoger> You've just done exactly what the Tor developers will tell you straight up not to do.
22:12:07 <TheJollyRoger> Now your exit node knows that someone is pinging connectivity.grapheneos.org to detect captive portals and can see your DNS Queries, because rather than use Tor topically and implementing proper stream isolation as Tor is intended to do, you just shovelled everything over the same connection.
22:13:20 <TheJollyRoger> This is what happens when you try to custom tune without knowing the consequences of what you are doing.
22:13:25 <d11263x[m]> I understand for stream isolation but i thought the sys whonix deal with that problem efficiently.
22:13:52 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: Whonix implements stream isolation because the WS virtual machine is configured to respect it and work co-operatively with the GW virtual machine.
22:14:37 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: ideally, the LESS custom tuning you do, the better off you are.
22:14:41 <TheJollyRoger> Not more.
22:15:22 <TheJollyRoger> Because there are subtle nuances that aren't accessible to the end user, which often end up breaking things in weird ways if you try to do things in a way that the developers did not intend the tools to be used.
22:15:46 <d11263x[m]> Ok i understand  a whonix workstation passed through to a pixel device would not provide. correct stream isolation was with the relationship between the workstation and the gateway .   correct ?
22:15:47 <d11263x[m]>  * Ok i understand  a whonix workstation passed through to a pixel device would not provide. correct stream isolation as with the relationship between the workstation and the gateway .   correct ?
22:16:18 <d11263x[m]>  * Ok i understand  a whonix workstation with its network passed through to a pixel device would not provide. correct stream isolation as with the relationship between the workstation and the gateway .   correct ?
22:16:27 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: how about this: use the tools as they are intended to be used.
22:17:02 <TheJollyRoger> Rather than try to score "nerd credit"
22:17:05 <d11263x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "d11263x: how about this: use the"> because i want whonix level anonymity on the graphene.  but seems like i cant achieve it.
22:17:50 <d11263x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "d11263x: how about this: use the"> is not about nerd credit . i genuinely need it for my setup  if you understand.  i need the portability and full anonymity too .
22:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: You achieve that by being humble enough to use Tor Browser on GrapheneOS as it was intended to be used.
22:18:10 <TheJollyRoger> Because that implements the features of Tor correctly.
22:18:39 <TheJollyRoger> Remember what makes a system secure is how well it's been tested, not merit.
22:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> Your custom tuned solution? You're now not only the end user, but you're also now the tester, developer and sole maintainer of the entire system yourself.
22:19:22 <TheJollyRoger> That's a MASSIVE burden to undertake and you don't know what assumptions the other packagers have made.
22:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> Or how your system is going to conflict with those assumptions.
22:19:44 <TheJollyRoger> Drop the toxic power user mentality.
22:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> Because that is how people end up getting fucked.
22:21:12 <TheJollyRoger> You ever notice how in those talks about "How Tor Users Got Caught" it was in those cases it was A) failure to upgrade in a timely manner (the exploit that people love to bring up repeatedly about the FBI zero day happened back when Tor Browser did not self-update, nobody mentions this), B) Custom tuning Tor, C) Bad Opsec.
22:21:19 <TheJollyRoger> You ever notice that?
22:21:24 <d11263x[m]> its not about some mentality or nerd cred.  everyone knows a whonix gateway ( full network level torification ) is far superior then some standalone tor browser even orbot.
22:22:11 <TheJollyRoger> Again, because whonix is properly set up by developers who know and test the system and they do so with full understanding of what the system does and what assumptions are made.
22:22:52 <fast1[m]> <d11263x[m] "its not about some mentality or "> It's not far superior unless you expect leaks somewhere
22:23:24 <TheJollyRoger> They release it as a comprehensive package that is designed to have its elements work in concert, and that's what makes it work.
22:23:32 <zvl12[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Again, because whonix is properl"> full understanding is exactly the point ... most of the times we try to make it better without sufficient knowledge and result is worse..
22:23:41 <fast1[m]> Does the Tor browser often leak your real IP? I don't think so
22:23:48 <d11263x[m]> <fast1[m] "It's not far superior unless you"> how can single instance tor along side regular traffic be better then a torification on a network adapter level.   the  later has 0 ip leaks.
22:24:46 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: because you're not mixing anonymity modes.
22:25:20 <fast1[m]> If you are that concerned then just use a physical Tor router
22:25:36 <TheJollyRoger> I suggest you read up on the theory of the modes of anonymity and why "tor all the things" is a terrible approach, because now you're channeling things into Tor that should NOT be associated with Tor usage.
22:26:00 <TheJollyRoger> It's the same reason why Clark Kent doesn't wear his superman costume to work.
22:26:10 <TheJollyRoger> Sure he's anonymous in his Superman costume, but now he's mixing anonymity modes.
22:26:42 <d11263x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "d11263x: because you're not mixi"> i respect your verdict however this was discussed by the whonix maintainers / dev on there own group and they didnt mention once this mixing anonymity modes issue,.  The issue they point out was wireless networks outside of the torified one potentially deanonymising  in some way .
22:27:32 <d11263x[m]> X YZ (Telegram)
22:27:32 <d11263x[m]> Even a perfectly working torified hotspot would also need to keep the list of surrounding WiFi networks secret to avoid inferred de-anomyzation by localization, right?
22:27:35 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: because they assume you're not mixing anonymity modes within that Workstation and they've taken measures to address it at the system levels.
22:28:16 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, it was on their wiki - Don't mix the modes of anonymity.
22:29:19 <TheJollyRoger> https://whonix.org/wiki/DoNot/ <- Look.
22:29:51 <d11263x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "d11263x: because they assume you"> all good anyway . cheers for your input and the info on the firmware earlier too ( appreciate it )  .   i will leave you guys back to your graphene chat incase i am upsetting anyone who feels i am offtopic lol
22:33:31 <TheJollyRoger> d11263x[m]: It's offtopic, but I'm not as big a stickler as some. I suggest though that you just use Tor Browser, keep it up to date, and don't fall into the "performative opsec" trap, because THAT is what gets people fucked. Remember Schneier's axiom: You can easily design a system that you yourself cannot see the faults in. Designing a system that OTHER people cannot see the faults in is a
22:33:32 <TheJollyRoger> much, much, MUCH harder thing to do, and piling on more packages without understanding what the designer's assumptions are, what the tradeoffs are, or how these systems are designed to interoperate won't make you safer, although it will often make you significantly less.
22:35:54 <TheJollyRoger> If you indeed are a high risk user, use the tools as they are intended to be used, and read the *developer* documentation on them, that's your best bet at staying safe.
22:38:27 <d11263x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "d11263x: It's offtopic, but I'm "> I have very good opsec. all my machines are corebooted running qubes and disposable hardened services. So in that respect i have no need for a tor browser bundle  my sys whonix deals with everything.   With regards to the pixel i am still learning and have yet to obtain a device  yet so that is why i came to this group today to get some more information about firmware
22:38:27 <d11263x[m]> and possibly using it anonymously before i bought one.   thanks again
22:39:21 <TheJollyRoger> Use the tools as they are intended to be used.
22:39:44 <TheJollyRoger> So if that's whonix, use it as it's intended to be used. If that's Tor Browser on GrapheneOS, use it as it's intended to be use.
22:39:46 <TheJollyRoger> *used.
22:40:13 <d11263x[m]> yes i here your point i just wanted the best of both worlds i suppose.
22:40:13 <TheJollyRoger> But don't try to cross the two over thinking that one will increase the safety/privacy of the other, because it really won't work that way.
22:40:22 <d11263x[m]>  * yes i hear your point i just wanted the best of both worlds i suppose.
22:42:03 <TheJollyRoger> Instead, they will conflict. GrapheneOS must make default connections because it needs to make those default connections to ensure regular users who want a usable device can do connectivity checks, detect captive portals (and properly address those), and get timely updates. On Whonix, that's not done because the Whonix developers understand that the VMs are updated out-of-band by the Qubes
22:42:04 <TheJollyRoger> centralized update system.
22:43:27 <TheJollyRoger> This is also why turning *off* some default connections on GrapheneOS start making you stand out more from the crowd, because now your phone is no longer making them.
22:44:18 <rIMpossible> Hello :)
22:44:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
22:44:57 <rIMpossible> Can I build the OS for OnePlus Nord ?
22:46:22 <rIMpossible> Or is there a list with devices, where the OS was successfully build for?
22:46:26 <TheJollyRoger> rIMpossible: GrapheneOS has compile time options for devices that it itself does not officially support. However, you will be on your own for that.
22:46:55 <TheJollyRoger> I actually welcome research into other devices and maintainers to step up!
22:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> But unfortunately, I don't know how much help I'll be there - I'm not a developer.
22:48:29 <rIMpossible> TheJollyRoger: ok, thank you
22:48:50 <TheJollyRoger> One problem we've found with OnePlus devices is they've been plagued by poor firmware security and poor support from the vendor in terms of firmware updates, security patches. It's possible to do it, but I don't know how suitable it would be for production or actual use.
22:48:57 <TheJollyRoger> *Some problems we've found
22:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> *firmware updates and security patches.

22:59:45 <d11263x[m]> That is why graphene tor browser its not equal even with orbot.
23:04:21 <mynacol[m]> I think about application-level modifications. Ever heard of Browser Fingerprinting? No for router or for system will help you there. If you use Toe Browser, it tries to mitigate it to great extents
23:04:58 <duck[m]1> bromite + orbot is preferred over tor for android
23:05:20 <duck[m]1> has more of an emphasis on anti-fingerprinting than vanadium
23:05:39 <mynacol[m]> Only because your table has more check marks for whonix than for browser doesn't make it "better" in all disciplines or threat models
23:07:00 <mynacol[m]> duck: But does things different than For Browser. These differences are detectable by websites, so you are probably the only one who uses tor and bromite instead of Tor Browser
23:07:10 <mynacol[m]> * duck: But does things different than Tor Browser. These differences are detectable by websites, so you are probably the only one who uses tor and bromite instead of Tor Browser
23:07:57 <mynacol[m]> You are hurting yourself instead of just installing For Browser and not messing too much with settings
23:08:06 <mynacol[m]> * You are hurting yourself instead of just installing Tor Browser and not messing too much with settings
23:08:25 <duck[m]1> <mynacol[m] "duck: But does things different "> i can guarantee you i am not the only one using bromite and orbot
23:09:00 <mynacol[m]> But probably the only one on a particular exit node. The majority uses For Browser
23:09:07 <duck[m]1> tor browser on android only has the app sandbox
23:09:08 <d11263x[m]> <mynacol[m] "I think about application-level "> whonix uses tor browser too ? the same tor browser configured to use a system tor.  and fingerprinting is age old everyone knows about it .
23:09:10 <mynacol[m]> * But probably the only one on a particular exit node. The majority uses Tor Browser
23:09:58 <duck[m]1> <mynacol[m] "But probably the only one on a p"> the number of tor browser users on android is also very low
23:10:24 <mynacol[m]> No expert regarding whonix. But your self-baked solution with orbot and bromite stands out
23:14:59 <rimpossible[m]> 'lo
23:15:02 <duck[m]1> doesn’t stand out any more than tor browser for android already does with different screen sizes
23:39:39 <madaidan[m]> <mynacol[m] "Only because your table has more"> Whonix uses the Tor Browser. Its web browser fingerprint is no different than that of any other Tor Browser user. The table above is comparing using Tor Browser standalone vs using Tor Browser within Whonix.
23:57:29 <ab2919392> i've got a question, if i enable orbot and force all connections through it via the vpn  setting and make all requests not able to be sent without vpn working, are there any other types of leaks that can happen?
