00:08:34 <jpp53> Trying to install graphene os for the first time I got these errors when I tried ./flash-all.sh

00:08:39 <jpp53> Rebooting into bootloader
00:08:40 <jpp53> Finished. Total time: 0.080s
00:08:40 <jpp53> The instructions made it sound as though I was supposed to install the "correct" Full OTA Image which on the site for pixel 4 for "flame" do I instead need "sunfish" which it says is for 4a?
00:17:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hello jpp53, the instructions list sunfish as the example because a majority of people are using the 4a because of its lower cost and good value. It sounds like you have a 4XL, which is a different device.
00:17:14 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to download the image, not the OTA.
00:17:56 <TheJollyRoger> Each image is slightly different, because each device will have slightly different kernels, different drivers, and different device-specific work.
00:43:46 <strcat[m]> jpp53: follow the official guide but change "sunfish" to "flame" in all of the commands
00:43:51 <strcat[m]> sunfish is used as an example
00:44:08 <strcat[m]> don't try to download / extract it your own way, follow the guide, just change the command as appropriate
00:44:16 <strcat[m]> alternatively, try https://grapheneos.org/install/web
01:28:48 <matt80> Working through the install process. Question: when connecting the Pixel 4a to my computer how do I set the USB settings on the phone? USB controlled by: Connected Device and File transfer?
01:30:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hello matt80, you're going to be connecting your phone in Fastboot mode. There is no USB settings.
01:30:38 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: if you are installing GrapheneOS, at no point after enabling OEM unlocking are you working with the phone's operating system. Everything past that point is done in Fastboot.
01:31:07 <matt80> Ok.  It connected in Charging mode.  So, I'll just drive on with the fastboot instructions and see how it goes.
01:31:15 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: please ensure you've got the proper fastboot from Google. If you are using any third-party "minimal adb" or third-party fastboot obtained through any other way, you risk a brick.
01:31:47 <TheJollyRoger> So please go to the installation page at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli and read everything there before you begin. Not just the commands, also the rationale behind them and the warnings.
01:32:23 <matt80> Running the process on my Windoze 10 box.  Yes, I am reading from the official instructions.
01:32:28 <TheJollyRoger> I won't be available tonight for a talk-through, but the commands there tell you everything you need to know to install the operating system, and why and how to do them, as well as which ones are relevant to your host operating system.
01:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:33:09 <matt80> sunfish is for pixel 4a without 5G correct?
01:33:41 <TheJollyRoger> You are correct, Sunfish is indeed for the vanilla 4a without 5G. If you attempt to flash a 4a image onto a 4a5G, that phone is now a $500 paperweight.
01:34:08 <matt80> good to know. mine is the vanilla one.
01:34:11 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:34:35 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a and 4a5G may look similar to one another, but underneath the 4a5G is actually a different device; different SoC, different kernel, different everything.
01:35:45 <matt80> And $150 lighter wallet
01:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yes, that too.
01:36:59 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like the Matrix bridge just blew up again. Everyone hang on.
01:54:52 <matt80> Will this stop exploding with so-and-so has joined?
02:13:34 <snooopy> matt80: most IRC-clients are able to hide joins/quits
02:14:08 <Latvia617849> Hi, my power button isnt working after latest update
02:14:15 <matt80> ok, thanks for that.  Turned it off.
02:14:32 <Latvia617849> When the phone is on, my power button doesnt lock the screen or prompt for shutdown options
02:14:49 <Latvia617849> I can always turn the phone on though, and it seems to fix itself over time.
02:14:56 <Latvia617849> Google Pixel 4A
02:15:21 <Latvia617849> For the past 5 minutes my power button is inert and i cant lock screen or shutdown phone
02:15:39 <Mruser42> Hey
02:15:46 <TheJollyRoger> Latvia617849: sounds like the power button may have water damage.
02:15:50 <TheJollyRoger> Or may have dust.
02:15:55 <TheJollyRoger> Mruser42: Ahoy!
02:18:44 <Mruser42> Can anybody give me some Infomation especially about a release Date for Graphen OS on Pixel 4a 5G bacause I stand betreen
02:19:09 <snooopy> Mruser42: There is no release date, its done when its done, sorry :/
02:19:12 <TheJollyRoger> Mruser42: Sorry, I can't give you an ETA at this point in time.
02:19:20 <matt80> Stuck in the install process.  Executing the fastboot flashing unlock command but getting <waiting for any device> Have placed the Pixel 4a into Fastboot mode. Nothing is happening. Tried disconnecting phone and reconnecting. Still nothing...
02:19:49 <snooopy> My power button works fine :o
02:19:51 <TheJollyRoger> Mruser42: If another maintainer stepped up to help with the workload, this would likely allow us to give a better estimate.
02:20:42 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: You may be missing the driver. Since you're on Windows 10, check for optional updates in Windows Update. Microsoft works with Google and should make this process automatic, but your computer may not have downloaded the optional update.
02:20:52 <Mruser42> Is it presumably that I will give a relaese at all.
02:21:16 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: do NOT attempt to source the driver from a third-party website, unless you want to risk a security compromise or a brick.
02:21:47 <Latvia6178497> Hi
02:21:58 <TheJollyRoger> Mruser42: it's contingent on another maintainer being present. Remember, people at android OEMs are being paid six-figure salaries to do this full time, our maintainers are currently all volunteers.
02:22:03 <Latvia6178497> Alright
02:22:10 <Latvia6178497> Hi
02:22:23 <Latvia6178497> My power button randomly stops working
02:22:25 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Latvia6178497, we see you. It's likely that your phone has a hardware problem.
02:22:26 <matt80> There is an optional update - Feature update to Windows 10, version 20H2
02:22:36 <Latvia6178497> Why do you think so?
02:22:44 <Latvia6178497> Its only been the latest version
02:22:49 <Latvia6178497> Of graphene
02:22:50 <Mruser42> Ok thats traceable. Thank for the fast request
02:23:09 <Latvia6178497> And when the power button is working , it works pefectly
02:23:29 <Latvia6178497> Is has sessions when it doesnt work at all, then it works perfectly
02:24:18 <TheJollyRoger> Latvia6178497 - all instances of GrapheneOS across a given device are signed, verified, and bitwise identical, down to the last bit. If the error isn't noticed on another person's device, it may be hardware, especially if the problem isn't noticed when the phone's "cold" but then becomes noticeable when the device becomes active.
02:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> Again, this is just a guess though so don't quote me on this.
02:24:41 <Latvia6178497> Well, when its working it works 100%
02:24:53 <matt80> Crap...needs a restart. Back in a bit
02:25:09 <TheJollyRoger> Latvia6178497: well, stick around and let's see if anyone else notices the problem.
02:25:15 <Latvia6178497> Id expect a faulty button to work 50% of the time fotever,
02:25:47 <Latvia6178497> It feels like a software issue, i can always turn on the phone first time
02:26:00 <Latvia6178497> And when its working its 100% reliable
02:26:06 <TheJollyRoger> Latvia6178497: well, then as I said, let's keep an eye out and see if anyone here experiences that.
02:26:12 <Latvia6178497> Have you?
02:26:16 <TheJollyRoger> No.
02:26:20 <Latvia6178497> Ok
02:26:28 <TheJollyRoger> While your client was disconnected someone else said no, as well.
02:26:39 <TheJollyRoger> Aw shoot, here comes the tide again. Brace yourselves, Matrix flood in a few.
02:26:41 <Latvia6178497> I think the physical button is fully functional
02:28:18 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: Oh, just if I see you here... do you think I should file this as an issue? https://a.uguu.se/KkXvinfN.png
02:29:05 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: not sure what you're getting at...?
02:32:12 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: This is the screen I get in phone -> settings -> Calls and it looks pretty hard to read, for me.
02:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: the font size?
02:33:10 <TheJollyRoger> Wow, we're having a really bad day with the matrix bridging at the moment.
02:33:16 <TheJollyRoger> All across Freenode.
02:35:24 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: Yeah the fon size.
02:35:55 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy it looks like the settings and landing screen of the contacts app and phone app seem to ignore the light/dark colour scheme setting and just assume light. If we update or change the phone or contacts app, might be able to look into that.
02:36:33 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: you should be able to change the font size somewhere in Display Options. Drag the slider to the right, it's under settings -> Display -> Font Size
02:36:34 <matt80> Well, Optional Updates installed, rebooted, set the PowerShell environment back up, executed "fastboot flashing unlock" powered up the Pixel 4a in fastboot mode.  Still get <waiting for any device>.  Sigh...it's an older PC. I am assuming that it should "just connect" and offer me a prompt on the Pixel 4a to confirm?
02:37:13 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: changing the display size will also change the font size a little, so you may have to experiment to find the settings you want. It'll change the font size across the entire phone.
02:37:17 <Latvia6178497> Plug in the device then flash
02:38:12 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: If it says <waiting for any device> then what it's saying is that it's missing the driver. You may need to update the driver via device manager via "update driver" while your phone is plugged in.
02:38:24 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: whatever you do though, don't install third-party drivers.
02:38:51 <matt80> Ok, no 3rd party drivers...got it.
02:39:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's how you end up bricking.
02:39:14 <matt80> Under Device manager it shows up under Other Devices with a warning symbol
02:39:42 <TheJollyRoger> Great, looks like it's detected that the driver is missing. Can you check to see if Device Manager will update the driver?
02:39:43 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: Yeah but the global font size is right for me, it looks like this if I go via phone -> settings -> sounds and vibration: https://a.uguu.se/TWiUGrJV.png
02:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: ohhh, wait a minute, I see. That's a screenshot itself, the one you sent earlier? I thought it was taken externally, my bad.
02:42:11 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: yeah, file an issue with those two screenshots explaining that the Call Settings screen under the Phone app has a blurred font.
02:42:20 <matt80> Device Manager is unable to find any drivers.
02:42:53 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: Yeah, and this is the result if the font is at the smallest setting: https://a.uguu.se/yFfwUEo.png
02:43:44 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: I see, I see now. Yeah, post all those screenshots for comparison, for a while I wasn't sure what I was looking at.
02:44:07 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: thy, will do :)
02:44:47 <matt80> The odd thing is when the phone is powered up normally the Win10 OS see it as a Portable device and I can browse the storage using the File Manager
02:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: It doesn't find any for "Android Bootloader Interface?"
02:46:13 <matt80> No, not seeing that.
02:47:04 <matt80> There is an ADB interface but it's for an older Samsung S5 I used to have
02:47:09 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: I'm out of ideas at the moment, stick around and once this join/part storm is over maybe someone more knowledgeable than I might be able to sort you out.
02:48:06 <matt80> I thought to Win10 box might be simpler but obviously not. I have a laptop with Linux Mint on it.  I think I'll try it from there instead.
02:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: Currently we recommend Ubuntu 20.04, although a few people have done it on Mint. Make sure you use the official adb. The adb included with mint and Ubuntu will result in an incomplete install and unbootable OS. You'll need the android udev rules to permit fastboot to talk to the phone through udev.
02:50:50 <TheJollyRoger> If this situation with matrix doesn't get any better, I'm going to have to find someone to complain to, this is like a denial of service attack on some channels.
02:52:07 <matt80> ok, will install the official adb
02:52:41 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: Good luck. I'll be unavailable for a talk through tonight, but the instructions on the install guide should include the part about udev rules.
02:54:04 <matt80> this is all it says: The udev rules on Debian and Ubuntu are very out-of-date but the package has the rules needed for Pixel phones since the same USB IDs have been used for many years.
02:55:03 <matt80> Doesn;t say I need to edit anything so assuming it will just work.
02:56:45 <matt80> @TheJollyRoger thanks for the help.
02:56:51 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: you'll need to follow the instructions for Linux. There is one extra step for distributions that use udev.
02:57:28 <dan-is-a-bloody-> the one thing i miss about copperheadOS was the aswesome glitchart logo
02:57:29 <dan-is-a-bloody-> some mrrobot shit that was
02:58:25 <matt80> ok, apparently it is just this step: sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common
02:59:10 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: yep, you got it. Good luck!
02:59:41 <TheJollyRoger> dan-is-a-bloody-: heh, maybe in the future we'll get some nicer boot logo to show off. We'll see!
03:00:55 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ye obviously
03:02:52 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: What is useful to include in the issue report? Build number and device model?
03:03:12 <snooopy> Or kernel verison? :)
03:04:43 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: definitely include device model and release version, the kernel version should already be known here, along with the system app version.
03:05:37 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run for a bit. See you in a bit!
05:11:42 <foolosofist[m]> Hey how come phones like poxel 4a and other premium phones arent made to work with prepaid sims?
05:11:54 <foolosofist[m]> * Hey how come phones like poxel 4a and other premium phones arent made to work with random prepaid sims?
05:19:33 <strcat[m]> should work fine with any SIM
05:23:31 <foolosofist[m]> <strcat[m] "should work fine with any SIM"> So i can go to walmart buy a sim and have no identiy tied to my phone?
05:30:08 <methodman[m]1> <foolosofist[m] "So i can go to walmart buy a sim"> Yes
05:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> You can go to a gas station, buy a SIM card there for cash, activate it, and use it with your GrapheneOS phone.
05:30:15 <methodman[m]1> I have a prepaid sim in my phone now
05:31:13 <foolosofist[m]> Holy shit
05:31:25 <foolosofist[m]> I dont know why i thought i couldnt do that
05:31:29 <TheJollyRoger> I do the same, but not for anonymity; I do it because I find it much nicer to have my phone carrier say "Oops, Jolly, you ran out of minutes, please top up to continue using data." than stealthily go "...MUAHAHAHAA NOW WE WILL GOUGE HIM FOR EVERY BIT HE USES OVER THE ALLOTMENT!"
05:32:12 <TheJollyRoger> (Billshock is a depressingly real thing here.)
05:32:16 <methodman[m]1> <TheJollyRoger "I do the same, but not for anony"> Haha I don't use data on mine, just WiFi
05:32:29 <foolosofist[m]> How do you top up? With bitcoin or spmethin?
05:32:47 <TheJollyRoger> With a credit card, but I'm not trying to be anonymous, remember.
05:33:15 <foolosofist[m]> Yea i feel you, but im wondering if i have to buy a new sim every month
05:33:25 <Knull[m]> are there esims that take crypto?
05:33:35 <methodman[m]1> <foolosofist[m] "How do you top up? With bitcoin "> You can top up at a gas station for some suppliers
05:33:45 <somenerd[m]> this is offtopic
05:33:45 <TheJollyRoger> Well, in some places places, you can simply buy a voucher for cash at the counter, and then you use a kind of carrier-specific code to enter it onto your phone to top up.
05:33:47 <methodman[m]1> With cash
05:33:52 <somenerd[m]> maybe move to the offtopic channel?
05:33:57 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, sure, point. Oops!
05:33:59 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
05:34:06 <foolosofist[m]> Ok im going there now
05:34:18 <methodman[m]1> <somenerd[m] "maybe move to the offtopic chann"> Sorry Sir!
06:27:12 <eoo9> Anyone know of a good solution for getting notifications from a Google Voice number while on Graphene OS? When I'm logged into Google Voice in Bromite or Vanadium new messages don't generate onscreen notifications. Any thoughts are welcomed! Thanks in advance and happy Friday
08:51:02 <FANOFYOU> Hello, I would like to send some ideas / requests for improvements for the future of the project .
09:03:42 <backfield-violin> Hi All - I would like to use gesture typing if possible. I tried AnySoftKeyboard but the gesture typing is at the beta stage currently. I saw this post [1] that describes installing proprietary library libjni_latinimegoogle.so from opengapps, to /system/lib64. Even if this works, is it s bad idea anyway: would it reduce privacy and security? Thanks, I'm new to this sort of thing but am thankful for the grapheneos
09:03:42 <backfield-violin> team. [1] https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/150439/enable-gesture-swipe-input-on-fairphone-2-without-google-keyboard
09:08:29 <take_a_deep_brea> backfield-violin: in order to install a library file just like that to /system/lib64 you will need access to the filesystem root which is not possible on Android itself without compromising the security model .
09:10:39 <take_a_deep_brea> and also as this is essentially a third party library and keyboard apps ususally have greater access to user data (user input) i dont think its a good idea to install this even on a rooted android device as it means placing significant amount of trust in unknown sources.
09:10:57 <backfield-violin> ok that makes sense - thanks
09:11:06 <take_a_deep_brea> it is better to go with gboard .
09:11:14 <somenerd[m]> or use the default
09:11:39 <somenerd[m]> you have to trust keyboards a lot
09:13:15 <backfield-violin> Yeah I know its not a big deal really, but I really like the fact that I can one hand gesture type replies easily. With typing, I find I have to stop and use two hands (what a burden, my life is so hard! 🙃).
09:13:49 <backfield-violin> is there any way I can contribute to the development of this feature with the default keyboard (AOSP)?
09:14:28 <backfield-violin> I know you can't always pick and choose such things but it would be cool to have it by default, but I don't know how or where to suggest this.
09:15:27 <backfield-violin> by contribute, I mean money, because I don't know how to code 🙂
09:21:52 <take_a_deep_brea> backfield-violin: the project has many privacy and security enhancing features that are in the pipeline and that take precedence : https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen
09:21:52 <take_a_deep_brea> ofcourse the end goal is enhancement of user security , privacy and **experience**
09:27:58 <take_a_deep_brea> and while donations are gladly accepted for the project as a whole  they cannot be made in order to spur development for a particular feature . you are welcome to get any developer you may know to contribute this feature for the grapheneOS keyboard
09:30:31 <backfield-violin> > <@ayaen_t:matrix.org> backfield-violin: the project has many privacy and security enhancing features that are in the pipeline and that take precedence : https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen
09:30:31 <backfield-violin> > ofcourse the end goal is enhancement of user security , privacy and **experience**
09:30:31 <backfield-violin> Thanks that makes sense. I have made a donation yesterday because I am pleased with the overall experience so far. I wonder where a developer could be found for such a thing. Do you have any thoughts?
09:47:08 <take_a_deep_brea> i am not a developer myself . but i can say that it is a feature complicated enough to implement . as you can see it is still proprietary and does not come with the AOSP keyboard . it may be possible to build an apk that will install libjni_latinimegoogle.so in the relevant directory and hence get support for gesture .
09:47:08 <take_a_deep_brea> but in my knowledge grapheneOS has always respected software licenses be they open sourced or closed source , and hence this kind of an hack will never be maintained as a part of the project itself
09:47:54 <take_a_deep_brea> this also being one of the main reasons why microg is yet to be added into the project .
10:06:14 <take_a_deep_brea>  * i am not a developer myself . but i can say that it is a feature complicated enough to implement . as you can see it is still proprietary and does not come with the AOSP keyboard . it may be possible to build an apk that will install libjni_latinimegoogle.so in the relevant directory and hence get support for gesture .
10:06:14 <take_a_deep_brea> but in my knowledge grapheneOS has always respected software licenses irrespective of the development model , and hence this kind of an hack will never be maintained as a part of the project itself
10:07:48 <rny> feature implementation needs to be maintained going forward
10:08:05 <rny> its not a matter of it being implemented then you can forget about it
10:08:12 <take_a_deep_brea> true
10:08:29 <take_a_deep_brea> quality of support is equally important
10:08:49 <rny> like the custom toggles, everytime daniel updates the entire tree, it may break then devs who maintain them need to do work to update the source to make them work
10:09:15 <rny> especially features that do not necessarily get upstreamed, we need to maintain them
10:09:51 <take_a_deep_brea> and we are basically just day dreaming if we expect our own implementation of gesture typing to be without any bugs
10:10:20 <take_a_deep_brea> and AnySoft is a good keyboard alternative
10:10:36 <take_a_deep_brea> and they are working on that feature
10:10:54 <rny> i just use google keyboard
10:11:40 <take_a_deep_brea> nice . i too may make that move .
10:12:28 <r0tt0r[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "and AnySoft is a good keyboard a"> it is but horrible to setup. you get through somehow but imho config should be redone
10:13:30 <backfield-violin> Thanks for this insights! So broadly speaking, the options are (1) AnySoft, perhaps throwing support behind them (2) Install google keyboard
10:13:41 <take_a_deep_brea> r0tt0r: lmao true . but i got tired so i just use graphene keyboard
10:22:27 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m thinks gesture typing in uncomfortable
10:22:33 <somenerd[m]> probably the best option
10:22:46 <take_a_deep_brea> which one ?
10:22:51 <jpds> OpenBoard is great
10:22:52 <somenerd[m]> default
10:23:16 <somenerd[m]> gboard is decent too, but with privacy problems
10:23:28 <somenerd[m]> other keyboards may have both privacy and security problems
10:23:36 <somenerd[m]> and they have to be trusted a lot
10:36:34 <backfield-violin> > * <@skyfox:kde.org> thinks gesture typing in uncomfortable

11:51:18 <dakotah[m]> I use gboard too because I like the swipe controls too much such as the swipe on spacebar to move cursor. There is chrooma keyboard though with all of that which is open source.

12:56:32 <rock> First Time installer - don't get my pixel 4a listed when typing "fastboot devices" which is preventing install.
12:56:39 <rock> do I need a win10 driver of some sort?
12:57:09 <rock> any help would be appreciated
13:13:38 <whitebear> evening all, i keep getting Error: An operation that changes the device state is in progress. come up. anyone know why? i'm using the web install
13:21:02 <rock> First Time installer - don't get my pixel 4a listed when typing "fastboot devices" which is preventing install via my win10 machine.  Do I need to install any win10 driver for this?
13:21:19 <rock> any assistance is appreciated
13:23:31 <eoo9> rock: when that happened to me it was a driver issue
13:24:11 <eoo9> Check device manager and see I'd you have a yellow triangle icon on your pixel device
13:24:14 <eoo9> Lmk
13:30:15 <rock> I do
13:31:20 <rock> searching for driver - installed Media Feature Pack for N and KN versions of Windows 10 - but didn't help.  still looking
13:32:33 <eoo9> Yeah so I had to install the android SDK (not android studio) to get the driver issue to go away
13:33:45 <eoo9> rock: after that I think you should be good driver wise
13:58:22 <gUser> Was anyone successful using the webinstaller with the latest sunfish-factory-2021.01.23? The Pixel 4a boots fine as long as the bootloader stays unlocked. If it's locked you get "can't find valid operating system". Shouldn't the right key be flashed as well when using the webinstaller? Thank you.
15:48:57 <chuy23[m]> I'm on Windows as well, following the official instructions and I get to flashing the images (./flash-all.bat) and it doesn't recognize the file name or path. I even tried double clicking flash all" in the power tools folder and it causes the command prompt to flash and then nothing happens.
15:51:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> What file name/path does it not recognize?
15:52:02 <chuy23[m]> I get to the end (on windows w/ pixel4a) where I flash the images (./flash-all.bat) and it does nothing..says it can't find it or unrecognizable, check path or name, etc.
15:54:01 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> chuy23: Are you running ./flash-all.bat from the same shell where you unlocked the bootloader?
15:56:39 <chuy23[m]> > chuy23: Are you running ./flash-all.bat from the same shell where you unlocked the bootloader?
15:56:39 <chuy23[m]> Yes
15:57:00 <chuy23[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "What file name/path does it not "> ./flash-all.bat
15:57:19 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Did you `cd` into the folder with `flash-all.bat`?
15:57:45 <chuy23[m]> I'm not sure if I did or not, I followed the guide on grapheneos website
15:58:38 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Type `ls` in the shell and see if it lists flash-all.bat
16:00:06 <chuy23[m]> Ok it listed the folders "documents, downloads, links, music, pictures" etc. Etc
16:00:58 <chuy23[m]> I was gonna say I think it's a path issue, especially after that I'm thinking I need to include the folder the powertools folder is in as a path...does that seem right?
16:01:23 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Is there a folder that starts with `sunfish-factory`?
16:01:57 <chuy23[m]> Not on this list, but I do have that folder on my pc
16:02:42 <chuy23[m]> The directory is c:\user\"name of my computer"
16:02:48 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I suggest you restart the install and follow the instruction very carefully
16:02:53 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m>  * I suggest you restart the install and follow the instructions very carefully
16:03:26 <chuy23[m]> Ok should I delete powertools and sunfish folder
16:03:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I guess
16:03:56 <rock> might as well - only issue I had was that I needed to find the google USB driver.  Once I had that, no issues.
16:04:01 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> If downloading them again is not a problem
16:04:03 <chuy23[m]> Also, how do I know I'm not using an administrator powershell session? I think that might be one part I looked over initially
16:04:12 <rock> which, BTW, is available here:  https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
16:04:33 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <chuy23[m] "Also, how do I know I'm not usin"> Did the admin prompt appear when you opened PowerShell?
16:05:11 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <rock "which, BTW, is available here:  "> The drivers can be installed via Windows Update
16:05:15 <chuy23[m]> Downloading sunfish again might be an issue bc I'm in a rural area on a hotspot and it kept failing, so I downloaded it to my other phone and transfered the files to my pc via USB.
16:06:01 <chuy23[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Did the admin prompt appear when"> No

19:20:18 <Chris86> Good Morning. I purchased a pixel 3a used and is unlocked. I installed graphene after doing updates. Once Graphene was competed the screen is still showing light red colored demo start screen in the background? How do I turn that off?
19:23:05 <strcat[m]> Chris86: not at all clear what you mean
19:23:06 <strcat[m]> make sure you lock
19:28:46 <Chris86> Thanks it was locked after. Thinking I need to possibly reload. The screen is small red window that pops up in the background and is visbal on white screen settings. Its lik eit was a demo phone from a dealer. I bought it on Walmart

20:08:27 <strcat[m]> please don't advertise scams here, thanks
20:11:12 <strcat[m]> Chris86: doesn't really sound like you've installed GrapheneOS properly including locking it
20:11:15 <strcat[m]> verify it with Auditor
20:23:11 <jniles> How to fix "no valid slot to boot"
20:23:12 <jniles> ?
20:24:00 <strcat[m]> follow the installation process again
20:24:08 <strcat[m]> make sure you have a reliable USB cable and don't miss steps
20:24:13 <strcat[m]> it means it wasn't installed properly
20:29:48 <jniles> thanks
20:30:00 <jniles> How far back in the steps should I go?
20:30:09 <jniles> Redownload ROM?
20:30:16 <jniles> Or just new cable and re-flash?
20:33:39 <strcat[m]> reflash
20:33:47 <jniles> Same problem with new cable. I am quite certain that I have all steps down
20:34:05 <strcat[m]> use the cable that comes with the phone
20:34:21 <jniles> I don't have a USB C port to work with
20:34:27 <jniles> On my machine
20:34:34 <strcat[m]> then you need a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable
20:34:39 <strcat[m]> most are not to spec and don't work properly
20:34:52 <strcat[m]> you may not have one that works properly
20:35:02 <jniles> Hmm, well it's nice to think that its just a cable problem
20:35:41 <strcat[m]> it's the most common issue and is why we have information covering it in both install pages
20:36:03 <jniles> Yeah, I noticed that
20:36:19 <strcat[m]> you could also try https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:36:24 <strcat[m]> but I think it's a cable issue
20:36:32 <strcat[m]> and the same issue will likely happen either way
20:36:43 <jniles> So, if Google logo flashes before getting to the fast boot screen, it probably did not work, right?
20:36:53 <strcat[m]> not related
20:37:04 <jniles> And, when on the fastboot screen, I want to reboot system now?
20:37:12 <jniles> Or return to boatload?
20:37:41 <strcat[m]> jniles: does it successfully boot into the GrapheneOS userspace fastboot mode and flash stuff there, then boots back to the bootloader menu?
20:37:43 <strcat[m]> after it finishes
20:37:48 <strcat[m]> jniles: don't know what you mean
20:37:54 <jniles> I may not have been letting it finish
20:38:06 <strcat[m]> jniles: you are just supposed to wait
20:38:19 <strcat[m]> it boots itself back to the bootloader menu when it's done with the userspace fastboot
20:38:25 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you were interrupting it before it flashed the rest of the OS
20:38:40 <jniles> yeah
20:38:44 <jniles> I think so
20:38:47 <jniles> ok
20:38:48 <strcat[m]> it flashes the firmware images, then the core OS images, then boots into a minimal form of the OS for flashing the rest of the OS
20:38:57 <strcat[m]> then it boots back to the bootloader menu so that you can lock
20:38:58 <jniles> So, I still have a red triable
20:39:01 <jniles> triangle
20:39:02 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to interact with any menu
20:39:09 <strcat[m]> jniles: just flash again and let it finish
20:39:12 <jniles> "Enter reason: reboot boot loader"
20:39:30 <strcat[m]> after ./flash-all.sh you just wait until it's ready for you to do fastboot flashing lock
20:39:47 <strcat[m]> you don't interact with the device except to confirm unlocking and then later to confirm locking
20:39:53 <strcat[m]> don't do anything it doesn't say to do
20:39:55 <jniles> Will terminal print any kind of status when it's done?
20:40:08 <strcat[m]> it will show that the command is finished
20:40:13 <strcat[m]> and then it's time to lock
20:40:22 <strcat[m]> you have to wait until it finishes
20:40:45 <jniles> Ok. It runs multiple processes and says "finished" several times which I guess confused me
20:41:12 <strcat[m]> leave it until it shows a prompt to enter a new command
20:41:25 <jniles> Ok great. This is super helpful
20:41:27 <strcat[m]> don't interact with the device until you run the `fastboot flashing lock` command and need to confirm it
20:41:42 <strcat[m]> nothing else needs to be confirmed other than unlock and lock, you don't interact with the device other than those confirmations
20:41:56 <jniles> beautiful
20:44:28 <jniles> Ok, I think it worked!
20:44:41 <jniles> I'm a MF hacker!
20:44:54 <jniles> Thanks @strcat1
20:45:12 <jniles> My impatience would have doomed me to repeat that process forever
20:56:05 <strcat[m]> jniles: I can clarify it in both pages
20:58:50 <adeus[m]> Hey what is the link to that non official GrapheneOS wiki with useful info and tips ?
21:04:59 <jniles> You rule. Thanks for making a great product. Ciao
21:18:22 <whitebear> Mprning all, I'm getting Error: An operation that changes the device state is in progress come up when i try and flash factory images on the web install. any ideas?
21:20:50 <whitebear> pixel 4a if that helps?
21:25:48 <strcat[m]> whitebear: which OS / browser
21:27:22 <whitebear> using chrome
21:29:02 <whitebear> its gone through the steps after restarting the web install but now the phone says cant find operating system. the device will not start
21:29:08 <whitebear> windows 10 OS
21:32:01 <whitebear> have I turned it to a brick?
21:42:07 <whitebear> do i need to do anything when the phone gets to the fastbootd screen?
21:51:17 <strcat[m]> no, you haven't turned it into a brick
21:51:21 <strcat[m]> you just need to successfully flash the OS
21:51:29 <strcat[m]> whitebear: no, if you're doing something there that's the issue
21:51:37 <strcat[m]> you need to wait until it finishes and boots back to the bootloader menu
21:51:38 <strcat[m]> then lock
21:56:31 <strcat[m]> whitebear: restart the bootloader, start the flashing process again, make sure to let it fully complete
22:10:26 <strcat[m]> whitebear: did it work for you?
22:11:52 <nux> strcat[m]: Thank you for your efforts!
22:15:03 <whitebear> ill try again mate. I've already done it once and the same thing happened
22:15:39 <TheJollyRoger> whitebear: You'll need to make sure that you let the flashing script run to completion before you disturb the phone. As tempting as it may be, or as inactive as the phone looks,
22:15:54 <TheJollyRoger> wait for Fastboot running on the computer to tell you when it's done.
22:16:14 <nux> strcat[m]: I know it can be a thankless endeavor but rest assured, many are benefiting and are truly thankful...
22:16:32 <whitebear> ok starting the flash again
22:16:47 <TheJollyRoger> whitebear, set the phone flat on the desk, screen-side-down.
22:17:04 <TheJollyRoger> Don't disturb it until the desktop you're installing from tells you it's OK to.
22:17:05 <whitebear> why screen side down?
22:17:11 <whitebear> ah yep roger
22:17:22 <TheJollyRoger> So that way you aren't tempted to think "oh it's presenting a menu, maybe it's done."
22:17:22 <strcat[m]> you don't have to do that, just don't do anything until it says it's done on the computer
22:17:39 <strcat[m]> there are 2 points where you interact with the device: confirming unlock, then confirming lock
22:17:47 <strcat[m]> at no point do you interact with the device between those
22:17:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah or that.
22:18:03 <whitebear> I haven't touched it the last two times until it came to locking and unlocking
22:18:26 <strcat[m]> the flashing process will end up booting it into a userspace flashing mode and needs to be allowed to finish flashing and then it will reboot back to the bootloader interface
22:18:42 <strcat[m]> I just added a clarification that it shouldn't be interrupted - adds more text though, so people will think it's more complicated now
22:18:54 <whitebear> I just wasn't sure whether I did have to touch something. ah yep sweet as.
22:19:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-factory-images
22:20:36 <whitebear> ok it has come up as flashed on the web install

22:21:09 <strcat[m]> now lock
22:21:24 <strcat[m]> then it should be all good
22:21:27 <strcat[m]> after confirming lock
22:21:50 <whitebear> its back in the fast boot mode
22:21:59 <whitebear> do i just press power button to start?
22:22:00 <strcat[m]> yeah, so use the lock action and confirm lock
22:22:07 <strcat[m]> and then if it says locked
22:22:09 <strcat[m]> press power to start
22:22:10 <whitebear> yes device is locked
22:22:35 <whitebear> nope comes up with same thing
22:23:22 <strcat[m]> comes up with what?
22:23:44 <whitebear> can't find valid operating system.
22:23:50 <whitebear> the device will not start
22:24:15 <strcat[m]> what kind of USB cable are you using?
22:24:24 <whitebear> usb to usb c
22:24:41 <whitebear> i dont have a usb c port on my laptop
22:25:22 <whitebear> its in one of the SS ports
22:27:12 <strcat[m]> whitebear: you should unlock again
22:27:22 <strcat[m]> whitebear: the issue is probably that you're using a broken USB cable
22:27:28 <strcat[m]> you need a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable
22:27:36 <strcat[m]> most of those cables are very low quality / not to spec
22:27:48 <whitebear> ah roger. ill go find another one
22:31:01 <whitebear> ok trying again with a different cable
22:31:16 <mike-of-earth> wth
22:31:45 <mike-of-earth> When I join, can you guys see the IP I join with?
22:32:21 <mike-of-earth> hmm
22:32:47 <mike-of-earth> looks like you can. Thanks VixenXY for quitting to show me :)
22:33:32 <TheJollyRoger> mike-of-earth: yes, if you haven't registered with most IRC networks, your IP address is generally visible unless you have a registered nickname and set an IP cloak with nickserv.
22:34:07 <mike-of-earth> Oh, that's it! IP cloak. Thanks! Still working on setting up this IRC thing... it's been years since I used IRC.
22:34:25 <mike-of-earth> Loving weechat
22:35:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you can also set CERTAUTH as well. You can join us in the #grapheneos-offtopic channel for more IRC discussion stuff and tips if you like!
22:36:19 <mike-of-earth> thanks!
22:38:38 <whitebear> tried with a new, better quality cable and still coming up with the same error
22:41:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, wonder if we'll need to do a manual install.
22:41:53 <strcat[m]> whitebear: there's a known issue that should be fixed soon, recommend waiting a bit
22:41:59 <whitebear> that's my only thoughts now. I'm not overly sure how to do the manujal install
22:42:33 <TheJollyRoger> I can guide you through it later, if all else fails.
22:42:46 <strcat[m]> whitebear: wait an hour or so
22:42:58 <strcat[m]> I'll let you know when to force refresh and try again
22:43:21 <whitebear> thanks mate legends!
22:45:47 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
22:48:24 <strcat[m]> whitebear: force refresh the page (ctrl-f5) and try again
22:48:42 <whitebear> ok will do now
22:49:58 <whitebear> starting to flash again
22:52:39 <whitebear> i don't need a sim card or anything in do I?
22:53:56 <TheJollyRoger> whitebear: don't think so, you shouldn't need a SIM card at all.
22:54:28 <whitebear> device is loading
22:54:40 <whitebear> looks like we're on a winner!
22:54:45 <foolosofist[m]> Hey regarding triangulation
22:55:03 <foolosofist[m]> on graphene, if my wifi is turned off then it cant scan?
22:55:24 <TheJollyRoger> whitebear: woohoo!
22:55:39 <foolosofist[m]> I dont fully rember what Rob Braxman said, but i think he said wifiscannin is done in phones even in airplane mode
22:55:54 <whitebear> I'm in! thanks heaps guys
22:56:17 <TheJollyRoger> whitebear: glad to hear it! Don't forget to lock your bootloader, and then afterwards once it's successfully running you can switch "OEM Unlocking" to off.
22:56:41 <whitebear> awesome thanks mate
22:57:16 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, welcome aboard the good ship GrapheneOS, shipmate!
22:57:22 <TheJollyRoger> Today, we set sail for privacy!
22:57:54 <TheJollyRoger> f you find GrapheneOS useful or want to support the work, help us out at https://grapheneos.org/donate . To avoid conflicts of interest, GrapheneOS doesn't have a corporate sponsor so the project's funded entirely by donations, so that keeps this ship sailing!
22:59:05 <whitebear> thanks mate ill be sure to flick some xmr your way
22:59:22 <strcat[m]> @room https://grapheneos.org/install/web had an important fix applied so if you weren't succeeding with it earlier, try again now - should work fine everywhere but flashing from Android now
22:59:35 <strcat[m]>  * @room https://grapheneos.org/install/web had an important fix applied so if you weren't succeeding with it earlier, try again now - should work fine everywhere but flashing from another Android device now
22:59:38 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! Splice the mainbrace!
22:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> whitebear: Yarr, thank'ee!
23:00:13 <strcat[m]> still experimental but it's getting more robust and that fix appears to have gotten it working properly again
23:00:27 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome, thank you strcat[m]!
23:05:46 <strcat[m]> flashing from another Android device needs some additional work to work reliably
23:06:00 <strcat[m]> everywhere else, it should work properly now, at least with a reliable cable
23:06:00 <mynacol[m]> <foolosofist[m] "I dont fully rember what Rob Bra"> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
23:06:15 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: it's not
23:06:35 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: as I said frequently, find a better source of information than non-technical YouTube influencers poorly interpreting news articles from non-technical journalists
23:06:47 <strcat[m]> and those news articles are largely broken telephone coverage of other news articles by non-technical journalists
23:06:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> uses unreliable $0.5 cable connected to an extension cable
23:07:00 <strcat[m]> it is not a good source of information, especially when you're getting it filtered through multiple levels like that

23:07:14 <strcat[m]>  * foolosofist: as I've said frequently, find a better source of information than non-technical YouTube influencers poorly interpreting news articles from non-technical journalists
23:07:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway guys I need to bring something important to your notice
23:07:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> So lately there has been a bunch of misinformation being spread by CopperheadOS on Wikipedia pages
23:08:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> People who read these pages often are misled and only see a biased version that one party wants you to see
23:08:28 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: read my message to you
23:08:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need competent people who can edit Wikipedia in a way that is completely neutral
23:11:30 <strcat[m]> please DO NOT go and edit Wikipedia on behalf of our project in a biased way - yes, it is problematic that Copperhead is having people edit those articles
23:11:43 <strcat[m]> but it's not appropriate to be directing this community to go and violate their policy in the same way
23:12:05 <strcat[m]> I don't know what the solution is to what they are doing
23:13:34 <madaidan[m]> <foolosofist[m] "I dont fully rember what Rob Bra"> Rob Braxman is the worst person to get your information from...
23:14:01 <packetup> This has probably been asked a million times but does the GrapheneOS release for the 4a work with the 5g version?
23:14:39 <strcat[m]> packetup: no
23:14:49 <strcat[m]> packetup: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
23:15:13 <packetup> I see.
23:15:14 <TheJollyRoger> packetup: if you attempt to use the 4a on the 4a5G, you will end up with a permanent brick.
23:15:46 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a5G might look like a 4a, it might feel like a 4a, but underneath, the chip, the kernel, all the drivers, they're very different.
23:15:46 <foolosofist[m]> <strcat[m] "foolosofist: as I said frequentl"> But isnt Rob an engineer himself thats been doing it his whole life?
23:16:07 <packetup> I was not aware. Thank you.
23:16:44 <madaidan[m]> <foolosofist[m] "But isnt Rob an engineer himself"> No, he's full of shit.
23:16:48 <TheJollyRoger> packetup: yeah, it's... it's not your fault. Google was out to lunch when they named thedevices, they should have called it something like the 5b or something like that because it's more closely related to the 5 than the 4 is.
23:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> I suppose they named it the 4a5G because they figured they'd just copy the design from the 4a, use a different chip, and because most people don't change their phones around, they likely wouldn't notice. For most of the users who simply buy their phones, use them out of the box, then trade them away once they pay off their carrier tab, that's likely the case, although for us it gets tricky :(
23:18:00 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: are you really that gullible? :\
23:18:24 <strcat[m]> he nonstop spreads misinformation on his channel and feigns expertise he doesn't have
23:19:01 <strcat[m]> regularly see people citing totally ridiculous claims from him here
23:19:05 <tidria[m]> <TheJollyRoger "packetup: yeah, it's... it's not"> I recall nintendo doing something similar twice in the same decade
23:19:07 <strcat[m]> or warped interpretations of things
23:19:20 <tidria[m]> wii > wii u and 3ds > new 3ds
23:19:20 <madaidan[m]> Braxman's messenger is still vulnerable to countless trivial exploits.
23:19:24 <foolosofist[m]> <strcat[m] "foolosofist: are you really that"> Its easy for you to speak with your experience and knowledge, but for someone new to privacy and security and all the bullahit big tech does, its hard to know what to believe
23:19:27 <strcat[m]> like misunderstanding what Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning is / does and presenting a warped interpretation of it
23:19:32 <madaidan[m]> It's not even E2EE.
23:19:41 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: well you're listening to a scammer YouTube influencer
23:19:47 <TheJollyRoger> tidria[m]: oh sheesh, I see.
23:20:19 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: just stop getting information of any kind from people on YouTube
23:20:41 <foolosofist[m]> I dont see how he is a scammer tho. Majority of what he says is true
23:20:45 <mynacol[m]> foolosofist: You can read everything on grapheneos.org
23:20:46 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: no, it isn't
23:20:47 <madaidan[m]> <foolosofist[m] "Its easy for you to speak with y"> Listen to actual experts that provide evidence and solid reasoning for their claims, not random YouTubers.
23:20:59 <madaidan[m]> <foolosofist[m] "I dont see how he is a scammer t"> Majority of what he says is nonsense.
23:21:00 <foolosofist[m]> And whatever else i personally jus dont know enough to speak on
23:21:26 <mynacol[m]> That will help you understand what is going on, why Graphene works like it does...
23:21:32 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: most of what he says is regurgitated misinformation / talking points
23:21:35 <foolosofist[m]> Yea some random dude ina chatroom?
23:21:38 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: and he has products to sell
23:21:39 <madaidan[m]> I've argued with him personally before. He is the perfect example of the dunning kruger effect.
23:21:48 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: look, if you promote scams here you get banned
23:21:52 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: final warning
23:22:00 <foolosofist[m]> Im supposed to veliev that? At face value?
23:22:18 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: if you continue to promote a scammer here, you will be banned from the community
23:22:19 <foolosofist[m]> Im not promoting lol, jus asking, but w/e ill leave it alone
23:22:43 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: you said yourself you don't know much but you're trying to argue with the a Whonix developer and the lead GrapheneOS developer about it
23:23:15 <strcat[m]> he's a scammer misinforming you and trying to sell products
23:23:16 <strcat[m]> you fell for it
23:23:33 <strcat[m]> most of the privacy and security industry consists of scammers
23:24:00 <BallistolEnjoyer> How to I harden my balls against a brute force attack
23:24:01 <foolosofist[m]> I didnt buy anythin from him lol
23:24:21 <strcat[m]> foolosofist: but you fell for his whole shtick that he's an expert of some kind
23:25:05 <strcat[m]> and it has derailed discussion in the channel
23:25:44 <ephemeralang[m]> Hello, everyone. I know that there's a way to use a socks or http proxy in the phone's settings menu, but I don't see an option within the vanadium browser. I have different mobile browsers for different profiles / purposes. Is there a way for each to use separate network settings or separate proxy servers?
23:27:36 <mynacol[m]> ephemeralang: For strong isolation between your profiles you should use the profiles feature of Graphene
23:27:59 <foolosofist[m]> <strcat[m] "foolosofist: but you fell for hi"> Yea im not the first, im learnin and ill know the truth when get more expwrience
23:28:15 <foolosofist[m]> * Yea im not the first, im learnin and ill know the truth when get more habds on expwrience

23:29:35 <packetup> @strcat:matrix.org: Any major roadblocks for Pixel 5 or 4a with 5g support besides porting and maintainer efforts
23:29:53 <strcat[m]> packetup:  needing developers to work on it is a major roadblock
23:30:23 <strcat[m]> I also need a new workstation and wasn't able to source the parts I wanted for it
23:31:00 <packetup> What kind of workstation?
23:31:08 <packetup> Talos II? hehe
23:35:15 <matt80> I've switched over to my Linux Mint computer and trying to install the Graphene OS on the Pixel 4a. However, seem to be stuck in the same place as last night. Executing "fastboot flashing unlock" and just get <waiting for any device>.  What am I supposed to do on the phone to move things along? The only options I see are changing the menu; Start,
23:35:16 <matt80> Power Off, Bar Code, Rescue Mode, Recovery Mode, Restart Bootloader
23:35:45 <strcat[m]> matt80: did you do https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#flashing-as-non-root ?
23:35:57 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to do anything on the phone
23:35:58 <matt80> Yes, did that
23:36:10 <strcat[m]> matt80: likely an issue with the cable that you're using
23:36:23 <strcat[m]> if you have Windows 10, I recommend installing from there, it's easier
23:36:37 <strcat[m]> you're making things harder rather than easier by using a Debian-based Linux distribution instead
23:36:49 <matt80> That could be.  I tried Win10 last night and got same results. MAybe the cable...
23:37:03 <strcat[m]> matt80: did you make sure that you had the driver there?
23:37:07 <strcat[m]> don't know what help you were already given
23:37:43 <matt80> JOllyRoger was helping me. It seemed the driver was not there on the Win10 box.  Did all Optional Updates but no luck
23:38:38 <strcat[m]> you need to check for the update after plugging it in with the bootloader interface active
23:38:49 <strcat[m]> you could also get the driver from Google but it's not necessary
23:38:55 <strcat[m]> matt80: it sounds like your USB cable doesn't work though
23:39:05 <strcat[m]> I recommend trying on Windows again but seems you need a proper cable
23:39:11 <strcat[m]> if you're not using the cable that came with the device, it's likely the issue
23:39:22 <strcat[m]> most USB-C cables do NOT work properly, especially USB-A to USB-C cables
23:39:22 <entry1[m]> <matt80 "JOllyRoger was helping me. It se"> Waiting for any device is normally an issue with the cable (just encountered it this week). The cable I've been using for a long time went randomly. I had to use another cable.
23:39:23 <BallistolEnjoyer> Is it possible to make storage not shared like iOS? I know AOSP doesn't have it by default but is it possible as a custom mod
23:39:32 <strcat[m]> BallistolEnjoyer: unclear what you mean
23:39:37 <strcat[m]> BallistolEnjoyer: storage is not shared by default
23:39:55 <strcat[m]> apps only have access to their own internal app directory and their app-specific directory in the profile's home directory under Android/
23:40:15 <matt80> I'll try and find another cable. Need to go from USB 2.0 to USB-C
23:40:36 <strcat[m]> matt80: try to get a high quality USB-A (not USB 2.0) to USB-C cable
23:41:11 <matt80> That's what I meant...USB-A.
23:45:10 <lodtank> i'm always wondering wether to cry or laugh when someone says to me how easy it is since usb, only one adapter needed anymore....
23:48:17 <BallistolEnjoyer> <strcat[m] "BallistolEnjoyer: storage is not"> I was told that iOS doesn't have access to storage on other apps but when you grant aotrage access on android the app can see other apps' storage
23:48:42 <BallistolEnjoyer> * I was told that iOS doesn't give am app  access to storage on other apps but when you grant aotrage access on android the app can see other apps' storage
23:48:57 <BallistolEnjoyer> * I was told that iOS doesn't give an app  access to storage on other apps but when you grant aotrage access on android the app can see other apps' storage
23:49:17 <BallistolEnjoyer> * I was told that iOS doesn't give an app  access to storage on other apps but when you grant storage access on android the app can see other apps' storage
23:50:04 <matt80> Well!  progress. I plugged it into a different USB port and it woke up and found the device.
23:50:10 <BallistolEnjoyer> I could be completely wrong about that as I don't really understand how iOS handles storage permissions compared to AOSP
23:50:41 <matt80> bootloader is now unlocked
23:51:57 <matt80> Do I need to install signify or is that optional?
23:53:09 <entry1[m]> Optional if you do not want to verify the file you downloaded before installation
23:53:24 <matt80> ok, thanks
23:55:00 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: it's optional only if you already have signify. If you don't, then you can simply use the attestation server to verify post-installation. The Attestation server has the genuine keys pinned, so it has the verified boot keys pre-authenticated.
23:56:07 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't already have signify as a preauthenticated, signed and verified build included in your operating system's trusted repositories, simply skip it and go to the next step.
