00:03:55 <poisonoushydra[m> I got some weird messages a few nights ago from an EvanR21 so I reported it to freenode.
00:06:18 <nullnode[m]> <strcat "seems we're being spammed again"> at least you know you're doing something right for these peeps to attack you
00:06:35 <nullnode[m]> they fear GrapheneOS.
00:06:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> okay so my pixel is plugged into the USB-C port in my laptop
00:06:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> but the web installer is not detecting it
00:07:24 <strcat> make sure to follow the instructions on the page about USB ports/cables and the additional instructions for Windows and desktop Linux
00:07:38 <strcat> you'll need to provide more details on your OS and what you've done, we can't help without more information
00:07:48 <strcat> you haven't made it clear if you've followed the guide sections leading up to that point

00:17:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> okay so on my phone it has the fastbootd menu, what option do I choose
00:17:06 <zzxx123> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<KileXt> Seriously, worst bridge"> use Matrix or somethinh lol
00:17:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Reboot system nowEnter RecoveryReboot to BootloaderPower off
00:23:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> Telegram is infinitely better than Matrix
00:24:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> guys...
00:24:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> did I just break my phone
00:24:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Can't find valid operating system
00:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> @Iickhitterextraordinaire no, you haven't broken it. What typically causes this is if the phone was interrupted during the installation process.
00:28:30 <TheJollyRoger> Fastboot is telling you the installation is incomplete.
00:28:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> my computer doesn't detect it anymore
00:28:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> the phone just has an error message on the screen
00:28:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> The (@T​heGreyGhostPhantom) has joined the Telegram Group!
00:28:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> telling me to go to g.co/ABH
00:29:07 <TheJollyRoger> @Iickhitterextraordinaire - unplug your phone, plug it back in.
00:29:11 <TheJollyRoger> Get it to fastboot.
00:29:36 <TheJollyRoger> Return to fastboot, start the process again.
00:29:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> it won't
00:29:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> it won't do anything
00:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> You must have interrupted it while it was in fastbootd.
00:30:03 <TheJollyRoger> While it's in fastbootd, data is being written to the OS partition.
00:30:17 <TheJollyRoger> You must NOT disturb the phone until it reboots of its own accord!
00:30:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> so is it broken
00:30:36 <TheJollyRoger> Iickhitterextraordinaire, unplug your phone from the computer and switch it off.
00:30:43 <TheJollyRoger> Switch it back on to fastboot.
00:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> Is your phone off?
00:30:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> THERE IS NO FASTBOOT
00:31:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> computer doesn't detect it, there is not fastboot menu
00:31:16 <TheJollyRoger> @Iickhitterextraordinaire, is the phone showing no sign of life?
00:31:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> nothing
00:31:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> it has a message on the screen that says can't find valid OS, phone will not start
00:31:51 <TheJollyRoger> @Iickhitterextraordinaire ok, sit tight, switch the phone off.
00:32:03 <TheJollyRoger> Switch the phone off, is it off?
00:32:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> it is not turning off
00:32:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> ok
00:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> Press and hold the power button and hold that sucker down for ten seconds.
00:32:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> it is off now
00:32:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. I want you to press VOLUME DOWN and hold it. Once you've held down volume down, press and hold POWER and hold both of them down until the phone starts.
00:33:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> okay
00:33:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> done
00:33:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Tell me what you see.
00:33:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> okay phew
00:33:18 <TheJollyRoger> Transcribe it.
00:33:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> no I think I see the issue now
00:33:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> thank you
00:33:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> holy shit I was scared
00:34:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I locked the boot loader too early
00:34:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> so when it is on the fastboot menu
00:34:39 <TheJollyRoger> @Iickhitterextraordinaire: Unlock bootloader and start the process again.
00:34:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> just let it sit
00:34:47 <TheJollyRoger> You MUST NOT disturb the phone while it is in fastbootd.
00:34:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> okay
00:34:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> thank you
00:35:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> sorry, it was just sitting there so I thought I had to interact
00:35:08 <TheJollyRoger> You must wait for it to reboot on its own and return you to the fastboot screen.
00:35:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> how long does it typically take
00:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> A few minutes.
00:35:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> okay cool
00:35:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> hooooooooooly crap was I scared
00:35:37 <TheJollyRoger> Are you doing it via the WebUI or the CLI?
00:35:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Web UI
00:36:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I'm so retarded I'll fuck even that up lol
00:36:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Leave it until it fully finishes flashing and returns you to fastboot.
00:36:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> sounds good
00:36:47 <TheJollyRoger> Do *not* touch the phone while it is in fastbootd. That's when the data is being written to the partition.
00:37:07 <TheJollyRoger> I recommend going and getting a drink while it's being written.
00:37:21 <TheJollyRoger> That should give it plenty of time.
00:37:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I understand now, maybe write something about that in the instructions because it just shows the progress bar full on "restarting the device..."
00:37:43 <TheJollyRoger> If it fails, just do exactly what I said earlier, switch the phone off, unplug it, and start it using that key combination I told you to.
00:37:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> so maybe just write that this is normal
00:38:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> and to wait
00:38:04 <hughbee> Hi guys (and JollyR), i am having trouble connecting to fdriod on one of my handsets, wondering if there are any known issues that I could work around ? Cheers :)
00:38:18 <TheJollyRoger> hughbee, can you describe exactly what you are seeing?
00:39:33 <TheJollyRoger> hughbee: no trouble observed here. Check to ensure the app has network permission set to "allow."
00:40:32 <TheJollyRoger> Will return in a bit.
00:40:34 <hughbee> Ill double check but im pretty sure I gave full permission. I recently put graphene OS on a few friends phones and i didn't come across this issue
00:40:48 <TheJollyRoger> sorry, must go afk for a sec.
00:40:50 <hughbee> No worries :)
00:40:56 <hughbee> im not in a hurry anyway :))
00:43:57 <hughbee> Ok so fdiod has network permission on.
00:55:45 <greennick> Hello friends, I've been trying to install Graphene OS on my Pixel 4a for a few hours now, and unfortunately I'm completely stuck and have no idea what to do.
00:56:42 <greennick> Whenever I use my USB C cord (the one that came with the phone) in Fastboot mode for unlocking the bootloader, every time I click on the button it simply says "no compatable devices found"
00:57:24 <greennick> I've tried automatically and manually updating my drivers multiple times, plugging it in, re-plugging it in, re-plugging it in before I reboot, re-plugging it in after I reboot, etc.
00:57:32 <greennick> Don't know how to get it to connect at this point.
00:57:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I had a similar problem, go into windows update, click optional updates, and download anything you see there. Should work
00:57:49 <greennick> Already did, unfortunately :(
00:57:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> damn
00:58:22 <strcat> greennick: you're on Windows?
00:58:33 <greennick> Yes. Sorry, failed to mention that
00:58:37 <strcat> greennick: you probably need to do the driver install bit, can't skip that if it didn'
00:58:41 <hughbee> Have you used the command adb devices to see if its attached?
00:58:43 <strcat> didn't get auto installed
00:58:51 <strcat> adb is not used as part of the installation process
00:58:56 <strcat> and they're using the web installer anyway
00:59:03 <strcat> adb is not used as part of CLI installation though
00:59:12 <strcat> greennick: you're likely missing the driver, need to do that
00:59:32 <greennick> Trying to figure out how to get the driver, I've already tried manually updating my drivers and manually installing the MTP USB driver
00:59:45 <greennick> every time I try to automatically find it it just comes up short for no reason
00:59:51 <greennick> note this is a new machine
00:59:55 <greennick> *computer
01:00:22 <greennick> and sometimes it doesn't even show up in the devices menu at all
01:01:10 <greennick> *device manager menu, sorry again
01:01:42 <strcat[m]> this isn't related to MTP
01:01:58 <greennick> It does seem to work when I boot up normally however and just have it plugged in btw
01:02:00 <strcat[m]> greennick: please look at the section on connecting the device
01:02:29 <strcat[m]> greennick: it needs to be booted into the bootloader interface, and plugged in, before you check for updates
01:02:50 <greennick> right, as I mentioned before, I've done that, done it in every single order I can
01:03:07 <greennick> booted it first, then plugged in, then checked, or plugged in, then boot, then check, etc
01:03:59 <greennick> when in fastboot mode it simply does not register as a device and if it does, it says that the proper drivers are not installed, but when I ask microsoft for what drivers I should install, it says that it cannot find any compatable
01:05:30 <strcat[m]> follow the instructions
01:05:34 <strcat[m]> use Windows Update
01:06:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> been in the fastbootd menu for like 30 mins now, just makin sure that's normal
01:06:37 <greennick> my friend, I'm trying to tell you that I already have
01:06:53 <greennick> I have followed the instructions to the T.
01:07:24 <greennick> the parts about manually re-installing the drivers is me just spitballing at this point because the instructions are not working
01:10:31 <greennick> My computer is going to die, I'll return later, thanks for the help so far anyhow
01:10:45 <southron[m]> Try different USB-C cables/ports.  They can be finicky.
01:12:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s​aucebrigade> If you're on newer version of Windows 10 then try installing drivers through "optional updates" in Windows updates.
01:12:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I am using the factory google cable
01:15:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​am090421> Can some one tell me if there any phone with GOS already pre installed in it?
01:17:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s​aucebrigade> In case of Pixel 4a the driver name is LeMobile fastboot drivers. Unfortunately newer versions Windows doesn't automatically install some drivers.
01:18:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> wait so

01:19:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> is this normal
01:19:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> and it just takes a long time

01:26:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> should I switch to edge
01:28:09 <ulmirdin[m]> Try turning off all the blocking done by brave and make sure you're not in incognito mode.
01:28:47 <ulmirdin[m]> If it doesn't work, then switch to edge or chrome.
01:29:21 <ulmirdin[m]> I'm assuming you already installed the optional update driver right?
01:29:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> yes
01:29:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> oh
01:30:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> it is

01:57:05 <ulmirdin[m]> There is an off topic chat for these question☝
01:57:15 <ulmirdin[m]> * There is an off topic chat for these questions☝
01:57:37 <sphinx[m]> It's @grapheneosofftopic for Telegram.
02:33:59 <simmered[m]> Is it a "bug" or just not an implemented feature that the always-on display doesn't change with the blue light filter? I know base android does it, so I'm not sure why my pixel 4a with graphene doesn't. Just curious if you wanted me to submit on github or not
02:35:49 <strcat[m]> base Android is AOSP which is what GrapheneOS is based on
02:36:28 <simmered[m]> Hmmm weird that it doesn't work, then. My pixel 3a does (stock)
02:36:58 <strcat[m]> stock isn't pure AOSP, it replaces components like SystemUI with extended Google versions
02:37:07 <strcat[m]> so you're not comparing GrapheneOS to baseline Android
02:37:10 <rny> seamless update crashed midway thru installing
02:37:11 <strcat[m]> you're comparing it to that
02:37:19 <rny> big update?
02:37:21 <strcat[m]> and you don't actually know if baseline Android does what you think it does
02:37:33 <strcat[m]> rny: what do you mean crashed?
02:37:44 <rny> service got oom-killed
02:38:00 <rny> midway through install
02:38:02 <rny> it was a very slow install
02:38:08 <strcat[m]> the service hardly does anything
02:38:13 <strcat[m]> so that's pretty strange
02:38:18 <rny> i will check again
02:38:20 <strcat[m]> it's not tied to the size of the update
02:38:20 <rny> in the logs
02:38:21 <simmered[m]> Oh, I see. Fair enough. I definitely knew I couldn't compare to my galaxy s10 since it has oneUI and all sorts of other garbage piled on top. I thought the stock pixel was more like it but youre right it's still not base. Any place I could request that as a feature? I know it's really low priority, so no worries either way.
02:38:36 <strcat[m]> simmered: we don't take those kinds of feature requests
02:39:04 <simmered[m]> No problem
02:39:04 <strcat[m]> unless it's something that's in AOSP and isn't working for us due to lack of overlays/configuration or something like exec spawning interfering it that's not within the scope of the project
02:39:32 <strcat[m]> some things like that are simply newer features than the current AOSP version provides and will be in the next major release
02:39:35 <strcat[m]> don't know what the case is here
02:39:43 <strcat[m]> if you have an interest in it the best thing you can do is research
02:39:49 <strcat[m]> and only come to us when you have actual details
02:40:06 <strcat[m]> i.e. what AOSP does, whether we need to enable something to get it, etc.
02:40:18 <strcat[m]> as is it's not a feature request we would accept
02:40:57 <simmered[m]> No worries, I know it's a very small thing. I will look more into it on the AOSP side and report back if I find anything solid.
02:41:58 <simmered[m]> Thank you for the info :)
02:54:02 <bizanon[m]> strcat: is there a way to assign permission to app so that it can only access internet thru WiFi but not mobile network or only mobile network buy not WiFi? If not, is this something that might come in the future? Thanks
02:55:26 <strcat[m]> bizanon: no, it's not possible to do it in a way that is meaningful for privacy/security
02:55:47 <strcat[m]> not within the scope of the project
02:56:10 <strcat[m]> INTERNET is a binary toggle, on or off
02:56:18 <strcat[m]> that's what the ecosystem implements
02:56:48 <strcat[m]> there is not a separate permission for different kinds of networks and that's too fluid anyway
02:57:39 <strcat[m]> bizanon: can you explain what you're trying to accomplish rather than asking about how you think it would make sense to do it?
02:57:50 <strcat[m]> asking indirect questions like this isn't very productive
02:57:56 <strcat[m]> what is your goal?
03:03:46 <bizanon[m]> Yeah okay. I'm using my mobile data at compromised locations under owner profile (I.e. my house). I'm using apps like discord and element etc. These servers will log the IP of my mobile provider. Even if I use VPN, I'm placing trust on VPN servers so I don't bother to do that at compromised locations.
03:03:46 <bizanon[m]> I dont have wifi at home. Just today, I turned on airplane mode and I went to a discrete safe location (crowded place like uni library) and turned on my anonymous lte hotspot and connected to the wifi. I accidently checked my element chat app from profile 1.
03:03:46 <bizanon[m]> I know I can compartmentalize with profiles but accidents like today can happen. So I thought if I set app permissions to make sensitive (already ID compromised apps like discord/element) to only use mobile data, then I don't have to worry about "contamination" of my compromised apps within safe anonymous work environments. Hope that makes sense strcat
03:05:11 <strcat[m]> okay, I really don't understand what you're trying to accomplish or why you think this is the way to do it
03:05:21 <strcat[m]> we're not implementing that feature and it doesn't have privacy/security value
03:05:32 <strcat[m]> think you need to rethink how you approach and think about these things
03:06:12 <bizanon[m]> Which aspects should I rethink?  Trying to learn here
03:06:29 <strcat[m]> you're just not approaching it in a way that makes any sense
03:07:03 <strcat[m]> bizanon: I'm not available to help with this sorry
03:07:10 <strcat[m]> you're making things overcomplicated / strange
03:09:19 <strcat[m]> making it more complicated isn't going to help you
03:09:48 <strcat[m]> you're suggesting we add a feature that you can further drastically complicated a non-workable way of doing things in a way that makes it more non-workable
03:09:51 <strcat[m]> you're not asking for what you want
03:10:00 <strcat[m]> you're asking for a convoluted way of making something more convoluted
03:10:12 <strcat[m]> bizanon: I don't think it's going to be productive to discuss further
03:10:25 <strcat[m]> my recommendation is tossing out the entire thing is starting over with a simpler approach
03:11:09 <strcat[m]> use a VPN globally, regardless of what form of it you decide to use, don't use it for some profiles and not others
03:12:16 <strcat[m]> and bear in mind the owner profile and base OS stuff always runs
03:12:31 <strcat[m]> and other profiles remain active unless you end the session or go over the active limit
03:12:52 <strcat[m]> don't understand what you mean by saying you accidentally checked an app
03:13:03 <bizanon[m]> <strcat[m] "and bear in mind the owner profi"> OK thanks for that reminder
03:14:35 <bizanon[m]> <strcat[m] "don't understand what you mean b"> What I mean is that I was only supposed to check discord/element using mobile data only. The WiFi is reserved for anonymous stuff which is why I bought the LTE hotspot using a drop and which is why I enabled airplane mode UST to drive up to the safe workspace
03:14:58 <bizanon[m]> * What I mean is that I was only supposed to check discord/element using mobile data only. The WiFi is reserved for anonymous stuff which is why I bought the LTE hotspot using a drop and which is why I enabled airplane mode just to drive up to the safe workspace
03:15:48 <ulmirdin[m]> I mean, your apps can still make connections in the background unless you kill them.
03:16:29 <strcat[m]> bizanon: you're making an overcomplicated, fragile system that is not enforced and cannot be
03:18:01 <strcat[m]> the feature you're asking for would not make that workable
03:21:11 <bizanon[m]> So I think just keep the owner profile empty and have a home(compromised profile) and a separate (safe workspace) profile. And never turning on hotspot at home only using mobile data. And at safe workspaces, turning on airplane mode. Something like that
03:21:24 <ulmirdin[m]> <bizanon[m] "What I mean is that I was only s"> If you only want your phone to connect to wifi, then turn off your mobile data. I don't get what you're trying to do.

03:23:18 <bizanon[m]> ulmirdin: using airplane mode turns off mobile data. That's what I did
03:24:21 <ulmirdin[m]> Are you trying to hide your IP address?
03:25:46 <bizanon[m]> Hide? No I'm trying to create a safe anonymous workspace. That's why I bought an LTE hotspot to use that for WiFi and shipped it to a drop in the first place.
03:26:37 <bizanon[m]> I am using a VPN on top of the hotspot yes. I'm hiding my web activity from the cell company
03:27:24 <ulmirdin[m]> https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/
03:28:37 <ulmirdin[m]> VPN doesn't make you anonymous. Tor does.

03:29:39 <bizanon[m]> I'm only using VPN to hide my we activity from the hotspot providor. I'm already anonymous because I'm using airplane mode at a crowded location

05:34:21 <jay46> Its been years since I rooted a phone.. and backed it up to be able to play around and load full backup again if I wanted.
05:34:39 <jay46> about to put on graphene and wanted to back up the phone setup I have right now first ..... whats the current best way to do that?
05:36:22 <jay46> any help appreciated. I have the pixel 5 and a ready to put on graphene but figured Id backup my full phone first. And I wanted to know how to do this so once I put on graphene I will backup the phone on a fresh install before I start playing around with it. thanks for any advice.
05:40:50 <mynacol[m]> <jay46 "any help appreciated. I have the"> Backing up the stock os is tricky. As the bootloader is probably locked, you won't be able to use TWRP or sth similar. The stock OS has only support to back up to Google.
05:42:48 <cstrrider[m]> <zzxx123 "https://freezer.life/"> Does freezer only include open source music?
05:43:49 <mynacol[m]> jay46: There is no point in backing up the system partition (especially after clean installation). With verified boot on stock OS and Graphene, the system will be bit-for-bit identical on any phone.
05:44:31 <mynacol[m]> jay46: For user data there is SeedVault included in Graphene.
05:44:32 <jay46> even with the pixel 5 where you can unlock developer mode you still cant easily back up the full phone ? I thought unlocking developer mode was same as unlocked bootloader
05:44:44 <strcat[m]> rick89: what are you talking about with the home screen?
05:45:12 <cstrrider[m]> Also I'm new to Graphene. I have it all set up and so far so good. A couple years ago I ran  /e/ and had trouble with push notifications, specifically texts, sometimes taking so long to go through that people thought I was dead
05:45:30 <cstrrider[m]> Any recommendations to not miss too many notifications?
05:45:33 <jay46> been 7 years since I rooted a phone or backed up one. Just remember I could save the entire phone to a sdcard and easily backup full phone and reload from any backup i wanted
05:45:38 <mynacol[m]> jay46: Nope, unlocking bootloader disables verified boot. Using developer mode is sth very different
05:45:45 <strcat[m]> cstrrider: notifications work fine
05:46:20 <cstrrider[m]> Signal with the websocket seems to be fine so far
05:46:26 <strcat[m]> cstrrider: as long as the app implements push without a hard dependency on Play, it works fine
05:46:31 <mynacol[m]> And unlocking the bootloader will wipe any user data irrecoverable
05:46:36 <strcat[m]> some apps like WhatsApp require that you toggle on the option for it
05:46:38 <cstrrider[m]> * Signal with the websocket seems to be fine so far bit emails aren't great
05:47:13 <strcat[m]> jay46: it's not clear what you mean by 'backup full phone'
05:47:45 <strcat[m]> jay46: suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption as a starting point
05:47:54 <strcat[m]> there's a lot of documentation available
05:48:05 <cstrrider[m]> <strcat[m] "some apps like WhatsApp require "> Thanks!
05:48:21 <jay46> I dont know how to put backup full phone better. Like press backup phone in whatever app, maybe it was titanium I used ages ago, and if I wanted  to go back to a prior backup it was the entire ROM i was playing with and all the settings, everything
05:48:48 <cstrrider[m]> Any recommendations for an open source news aggregator preferably with a widget to replace my google feed addiction?
05:49:13 <strcat[m]> jay46: suggest reading  https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption and other documentation that's available
05:49:21 <mynacol[m]> jay46: On locked bootloader not possible.
05:49:24 <strcat[m]> jay46: if you want to read about backups there's information on that available
05:49:30 <cstrrider[m]> Preferably not an RSS reader
05:49:35 <strcat[m]> mynacol: it's not possible period
05:49:36 <rick89[m]> Hey
05:49:47 <strcat[m]> mynacol: read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption and other docs that are available
05:49:56 <rick89[m]> I cant find hackers keyboard on fdroid
05:50:24 <strcat[m]> rick89: can you explain what issue you have with the launcher homescreen? you can certainly change the wallpaper if that's what you mean...
05:50:55 <rick89[m]> Not wallpaper the square icons and all that
05:51:07 <rick89[m]> Grids etc
05:51:24 <strcat[m]> the launcher uses the same icon mask as the OS
05:51:32 <strcat[m]> it's not something launcher-specific
05:51:44 <strcat[m]> if the launcher did have configuration for that... it wouldn't match the OS if you changed it
05:51:47 <strcat[m]> it'd be inconsistent
05:51:56 <strcat[m]> so I don't think that's what you really want anyway
05:52:43 <strcat[m]> AOSP has some basic theme overlays which are available but the theme settings thing isn't set up in AOSP
05:52:50 <strcat[m]> so you can only use it via adb and it's not advisable
05:53:10 <strcat[m]> we're open to providing it but it's not within the scope of what the project works on
05:53:24 <strcat[m]> so someone would have to provide a properly implemented configuration for it
05:53:29 <strcat[m]> as a set of PRs
05:53:29 <rick89[m]> Also the clipboard doesn't work on android anymore...any help?
05:53:32 <mr_hebi_san[m]> rick89 fdroid hackers keyboard in ddg took me right to something claiming to be hackers keyboard on fdroid
05:53:39 <strcat[m]> rick89: not clear what you mean
05:54:56 <rick89[m]> I mean the clipboard apps don't work on android anymore
05:55:21 <jay46> Okay, similar question then...  Once I put on GrapheneOS, and set it up like I like it, but before I start really using it, can I make a backup of that, for example, I put a few open source apps I like on it, setup my email in an app, things like that, and then can I take a backup of that setup, even if just a surface how the apps are setup
05:55:22 <jay46> excetera. Im on probation for cannabis and its possible when I go into probation appointments she might ask to see my phone, just personally look at it, not plug it in, I would maybe reload the backup I made for things like that, back to the initial setup I made. ..... super out of practice with any of this stuff.. was locked up for 7 years for
05:55:22 <jay46> growing and transporting cannabis
05:56:34 <rick89[m]> Jay46 woah
05:56:38 <jay46> yup
05:56:43 <strcat[m]> Seedvault provides backup/restore of OS data and owner profile / app data other than the profile home directory
05:56:58 <strcat[m]> it doesn't yet support backing up the profile home directory but you can do that with MTP
05:57:04 <strcat[m]> or another app
05:57:27 <strcat[m]> or just copy it over to the drive / storage provider you're using with Seedvault
05:58:22 <jay46> i guess I just need to dive in and start playing around.. bought the pixel 5 when I got out before graphene came out for it.. knowing I wanted graphene.. and just have been busy... and need to just dive in and put it on and start playing with it..
05:58:26 <strcat[m]> and the other main limitations of Seedvault is that it doesn't yet support the device-to-device backup mode to backup apps disabling remote backups, and it doesn't work with secondary profiles yet
05:58:58 <jay46> secondary profiles meaning a work profile wont get backed up?
06:01:08 <strcat[m]> I was talking about secondary user profiles
06:01:38 <strcat[m]> but sure it probably won't backup a work profile either, wasn't talking about BYOD managed profiles for enterprise deployments though
06:03:23 <jay46> i have just been using a work profile on the stock setup using Shelter and putting the couple apps I decided to use like netflix in the work profile to somewhat have it separated and able to be frozedn.
06:04:17 <strcat[m]> not how we recommend doing things
06:05:20 <jay46> as in not let a single app like that on the phone at all, ever?
06:06:24 <strcat[m]> no
06:06:38 <strcat[m]> as in we don't recommend that people enable / trust device managers or accessibility services
06:06:46 <strcat[m]> and work profiles are designed for BYOD managed profiles
06:06:53 <strcat[m]> they're owned by the device manager, not you
06:07:57 <strcat[m]> we encourage using user profiles as isolated workspaces but bear in mind profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox
06:08:00 <strcat[m]> it isn't their purpose
06:08:21 <strcat[m]> their purpose is providing a separate instance of apps, each profile separate from the others, without shared data / communication between them
06:08:30 <strcat[m]> although that's more about user profiles
06:08:48 <jay46> Okay, interesting, even though Shelter is an open source, the separate user profiles in the recommended method
06:08:54 <strcat[m]> work profiles have semantics determined by the device manager, it can allow communication between the user profile and nested work profile
06:09:02 <strcat[m]> jay46: open source does not mean well implemented or secure
06:09:17 <strcat[m]> open source doesn't magically make something privacy respecting or secure
06:10:01 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't make that a good feature for this
06:11:55 <jay46> stoked to learn more right now.. so thank you.. How many user profiles can you have ? If I decide I want to use a non open source app because I really am not doing anything ultra secure on my device other than wanting a degoogled, more secure, experience.. Would I have a separate user profile for each non open source app?
06:12:27 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "we encourage using user profiles"> Can you provide more info on this comment?

06:16:11 <strcat[m]> you're being disruptive in this channel
06:16:34 <rick89[m]> Ok
06:17:03 <skwisgaar[m]> What are the reasons why using a VPN only on certain profiles might be inadvisable?
06:18:06 <strcat[m]> because you aren't going to always remember to end profile sessions before switching and you might care about the OS data itself
06:18:08 <jay46> I got the idea that the device manager, shelter, could allow communication between the user profile and nested work profiled..... got that... So I thought the next question was different. How many separate user profiles can you setup with graphene, and is the idea you have a separate user profile, for different.  ...................  But I get
06:18:08 <jay46> it,... Its been awhile since I read the site and maybe even missed parts. I do appreciate the time.
06:18:10 <strcat[m]> just use the VPN everywhere
06:18:33 <strcat[m]> jay46: it has issues beyond that
06:18:45 <strcat[m]> rick89: using developer tools on a device meant to be secure is not advisable
06:19:00 <strcat[m]> rick89: trusting a computer with adb access makes it a development device that's drastically less secure
06:19:09 <strcat[m]> rick89: messing around with stuff in adb is not advisable
06:19:31 <strcat[m]> I recommend doing a factory reset of the device and starting over if you've messed around with adb, device managers or accessibility services but need the device to be secure
06:19:54 <rick89[m]> Ok
06:20:01 <rick89[m]> I will do it myself
06:20:03 <rick89[m]> Thanks
06:20:13 <strcat[m]> do what yourself?
06:20:35 <strcat[m]> if you've read the FAQ then you know that clipboard access is only permitted for the focused app and active keyboard
06:20:43 <rick89[m]> Ok
06:21:11 <strcat[m]> clipboard management is supposed to be done by the keyboard
06:21:15 <strcat[m]> if desired
06:23:28 <rick89[m]> My keyboard doesn't have a clipboard
06:23:43 <rick89[m]> And I use an app for that
06:24:16 <rick89[m]> But Google released an update which made clipboard apps unusable
06:24:38 <rick89[m]> I was able to fix it on calyx os
06:24:43 <rick89[m]> But doesn't work for graphene

06:30:24 <strcat[m]> and I'd also like to point out that in the middle of their trolling, a CalyxOS developer who has engaged in harassment and who was supposed to be banned from the channel left the channel
06:30:59 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure why they were here, but I think Matrix must have wrongly preserved moderation privileges for someone who was formerly trusted and banned
06:31:22 <strcat[m]> and it was used to remove most of the bans from our channel
06:31:54 <strcat[m]> not sure what happened to the bans

06:33:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Thank you for your answer, I'll try it that way then
06:33:51 <strcat[m]> they've supported a harassment and misinformation campaign against us for their own benefit
06:34:00 <jay46> To somone who has been far removed from this world, even what I could read just through cut and pasted net searches sent to me as emails while I was locked up, its apparent the that the narrative the guys involved with graphene tell is the truth. Seems like a crazy battle you have to deal with.
06:34:15 <strcat[m]> and they encourage their users to raid our channel with concern trolling, get banned and then post about it there to further promote themselves
06:34:26 <strcat[m]> it's accepted and supported by them
06:34:29 <strcat[m]> therefore they are part of it
06:34:32 <pizzaeater69[m]> Privacy community is 5% of people and still we are fighting against each other instead of trying to get those 95% to the boat xD
06:35:00 <strcat[m]> we're going to need to implement some stricter rules for involvement here
06:35:33 <strcat[m]> if you're in channels of projects / communities engaging in harassment and spreading misinformation to harm GrapheneOS and GrapheneOS developers, a bot is going to be removing you from our channels
06:35:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> You mean the Calyx project did that?? I really don't believe they'd do so
06:36:03 <strcat[m]> yes, they have done it on multiple occasions
06:36:05 <donkykong[m]> Isn't what Cali doing is different anyways they don't focus on the security side as much?
06:36:22 <strcat[m]> they don't do privacy/security hardening, and they include Google services / apps
06:36:27 <strcat[m]> so yeah, it's different
06:36:34 <strcat[m]> their focus is on providing customization and bundled apps
06:37:01 <strcat[m]> their community has been highly malicious and hostile towards us with the support of their developers
06:37:04 <strcat[m]> and is no longer welcome here
06:37:06 <strcat[m]> this was the final straw
06:37:15 <strcat[m]> if you want to participate in our community, you don't participate there anymore
06:37:18 <strcat[m]> a bot will be enforcing the rule
06:37:32 <strcat[m]> too much harassment, misinformation, concern trolling and other attacks
06:37:43 <strcat[m]> their community is used to organize raids and benefit from trolling here
06:37:45 <BobBraxboi[m]> <donkykong[m] "Isn't what Cali doing is differe"> Yeah, from what I gather Calyx is more focused on usability and Graphene is more focused on security. Not sure why they’d bother attacking Graphene though.
06:38:28 <donkykong[m]> They might be sick of people on there side saying graphene is better lol
06:38:48 <pizzaeater69[m]> <donkykong[m] "They might be sick of people on "> Truuuue
06:38:53 <BobBraxboi[m]> <donkykong[m] "They might be sick of people on "> Still, it wouldn’t be appropriate to respond with spam
06:38:55 <strcat[m]> does someone know when the bans in this channel were removed?
06:39:04 <strcat[m]> on Matrix, not talking about IRC
06:39:18 <strcat[m]> most of the bans are missing, which seems to imply someone removed them
06:39:32 <strcat[m]> Matrix has an issue with giving people back moderation powers that were removed earlier
06:39:54 * Dylanger[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/JdYHqKBeyiSwryQgBYTaKYTl/message.txt >

06:41:23 <strcat[m]> maybe it reacted to events on irc
06:41:53 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah appservice is what will usually enable/disable PLs based on when users join/leave
06:41:56 <strcat[m]> it seems like all matrix bans older than 1 day or so are gone
06:42:11 <strcat[m]> I'm talking about all the bans that were made here by moderators
06:42:14 <strcat[m]> which are suddenly missing
06:54:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> So you're telling me that you are going to ban me from this group only because I'm taking part in a CalyxOS telegram group as well??That's the most extreme and authoritative measure I've seen to this day on a telegram group! It would be devastating for GrapheneOS reputation. it's also an invasion of people's privacy to track their participation in other groups.I'm interested im different custom rom projects and k
06:56:17 <strcat[m]> I'm telling you that if you support projects engaging in harassing our developers and spreading misinformation about the project, you won't be welcome here
06:57:01 <strcat[m]> I'm disabling the Telegram bridge for the time being
06:57:45 <strcat> I spoke earlier about concern trolling and now we see more of it
06:58:01 <strcat> not surprising, really consistent form of attack on our community/project from there
07:01:18 <strcat[m]> just reinforces what has to happen
07:05:39 <strcat> Telegram bridge has been set +q on IRC so messages from Telegram will no longer be received here
07:06:32 <strcat> will need to start using Telegram to be able to deal with the other end of the bridge
07:21:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Since my participation in the CalyxOS telegram group id public, you can have full access to my interventions. You will see that in some of my latest ones I have actually been praising GrapheneOS (without having been bashed in return). So please don't mistake anyone for your enemy
07:22:14 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Is the plan to abandon Matrix?
07:22:27 <strcat[m]> no don't know where you get that idea
07:23:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat gm, just woke
07:23:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need something to be done telegram side?
07:24:07 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I am just confused regarding the forums here.  I'll just stick with Matrix then unless we all should switch to a different software
07:24:32 <strcat[m]> don't know what you're confused about
07:24:48 <strcat[m]> we have not announced or implied anything that would indicate we are getting rid of Matrix
07:25:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Hi Le marchand de rêves
07:25:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Hi!
07:25:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> What's going on lol
07:27:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> I got scared seing that message and that a bot is going to enforce that.
07:27:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> No need to worry about that tbh
07:29:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Le marchand de rêves I think you're misunderstanding something
07:29:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> That's great news then! Thank you about that because it got me worried
07:29:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> There is no bot that's going to check if you're in calyx communities and then auto ban
07:31:03 <Sparty> hola
07:31:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Thank you for the clarification, then yeah I totally misunderstood. It looked that way though haha
07:32:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Tl;dr
07:32:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> No bot is going to auto ban you
07:41:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> strcat you see this message?
07:41:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> I've talked with Le marchand de rêves
07:42:10 <strcat> yes
07:42:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> So let's just not act hastily and take bad decisions
07:44:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Thank you about that @clannad
07:44:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Look
07:45:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We are banning people who actually come to this chat with the intention of causing harm
07:45:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Nobody is auto banning huge amounts of people
07:46:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> That is perfect then, community management as it should be

09:49:35 <heychaffa[m]> Hi all, just testing to see if this works.
09:49:55 <strcat> works fine
10:42:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Where can I enable tabs to to be always incognito in Vanadium?
10:43:43 <mynacol[m]> @Le marchand de rêves currently not available
10:44:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Thank you for your answer. What is the reason for that?
10:45:02 <mynacol[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/65
10:46:08 <mynacol[m]> That's all I know
10:46:34 <Real[m]> Does vanadium clear cookies by default or do I have to fiddle in settings?
10:47:14 <Real[m]> And are there any good add-ons?
10:48:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rêves> Thank you anyway! I really hope it will be implemented since it is available on Bromite, it should be possible
10:48:44 <mynacol[m]> <Real[m] "And are there any good add-ons?"> There is no support for add-ons for good reason. Most add-ons are detectable by websites making you unique.
12:03:19 <Gustavo> Hi, folks!
12:03:19 <Gustavo> I need some help with the installation process. I'm following the web installation and, at the moment, I'm stuck at the “Flashing factory images”. At the middle of the flashing procedure, the following error appeared: “Error: Unable to claim interface”.
12:03:20 <Gustavo> What do I do now?
12:04:28 <Gustavo> I have a Pixel 5 phone, and I'm using Chromium from a Linux installation with Opensuse.
12:13:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Are you doing this on windows?
12:13:27 <Gustavo> No. On Linux. Opensuse.
12:30:21 <mynacol[m]> Gustavo: Sounds like another adb/fastboot daemon is running on your computer. Try restarting both devices and open the installation page only once.
12:35:42 <Gustavo> So, it's safe to start the process again from the beginning?
12:37:06 <Gustavo> Because my phone is now in an intermediary state since the flashing procedure did start but didn't go till conclusion
12:45:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Reboot the computer
12:45:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> And retry
12:55:52 <Gustavo> It worked this time! Thanks!!
13:04:39 <george[m]3> Hello, I'm at the moment using fingerprint + backup PIN. Is using password instead of PIN big improvement to security?
13:07:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Depends on your threat model, is physical attack part of it ?
13:08:43 <entry1[m]> <george[m]3 "Hello, I'm at the moment using f"> Makes a big difference if you use a PIN with "random" numbers versus numbers that have an association with you. Opting in for 6 digits or more is great. This would be considered a question for #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
13:13:02 <george[m]3> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<KileXt> Depends on your threat "> I wouldn't think so, maybe the better question would be does GOS use that pin or that password to encrypt privavate keys that are used to encrypt OS?

13:22:35 <entry1[m]> <george[m]3 "So is this room then only for in"> Just inquiries directly related to the features in operating system, installation issues, building issues, etc. The OT room is for discussion about what others do for their OpSec, advice on non-system apps, etc
13:25:38 <george[m]3> I guess this would be considered question for android in general then. Thanks for replys
13:26:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
13:28:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> What I meant is that if you always keep your phobe close and don't consider physical access as a threat then a simple pin is fine

15:09:50 <dannyknoll3[m]> Can you tell me more about what are some of these "base OS" stuff so I get an idea?
15:09:54 <dannyknoll3[m]> Are they like system time /  WiFi / Bluetooth / location. Any other less obvious ones? Thanks strcat
15:10:44 <zzxx123> <grayhatter "glad to see matrix is still tryi"> It’s worse If multi-line messages are forwarded to IRC directly.
15:11:19 <dannyknoll3[m]> But yes, Matrix<->IRC bridge is not a great compromise. Need modern clients with collapsed long messages.
15:11:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> For the base OS, you can get some idea from looking at apps_Packages Info with pink  "System" font color
15:11:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> On what components/apps always run

15:14:40 <dannyknoll3[m]> lickhitterextraordinaire: Pass/Fail, with some additional details
15:15:06 <dannyknoll3[m]> Green is good. Yellow is neutral/no way to know if good yet, red is bad.
15:15:34 <dannyknoll3[m]> Never seen red, so I'm just presuming it exists 😝
15:16:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> The only way to get "red" is to build your own system and try an attestation
15:16:53 <pizzaeater69[m]> Dumb question but what do you mean with feature "Stronger app sandbox" like how is it stronger?
15:17:11 <dannyknoll3[m]> anupritaisno1: You've never done thaaaat 😊
15:26:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​J1013Telegram> Are the GrapheneOS devices selected because the hardware has open-source components or because the hardware has great power?
15:27:14 <grayhatter> zzxx123: no it's not
15:27:58 <dannyknoll3[m]> JJ1013: Neither. Security. Please read GrapheneOS.org FAQ (and rest)
15:28:00 <grayhatter> there's either user data, or a link to user data that I can't access from my terminal... one is clearly superior
15:28:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​J1013Telegram> OK
15:28:27 <jay46> I walked away for a moment and got logged out.. did anyone answer what the reduced functionality for Google maps is in graphene ..
15:29:17 <dannyknoll3[m]> Willing to bet it's background functionality type stuff, jay46
15:29:42 <dannyknoll3[m]> I use it as a friggin webapp without major pain, lol, you'll be alright

17:05:50 <jay46> I am going to take the time to put grapheneos on my pixel 5 for first time this weekend..  question for anyone ... What's the best way to setup multiple phone numbers on the device. I've been using the textplus and a talkatone apps from aurora in shelter work profile and just unfreeze to use. I get that on graphene I will use user profiles that
17:05:50 <jay46> can  be frozen.. but even if I used these apps if not used regularly the number is lost or to pay they want you to subscribe only thru Google play store.  There's got to be a better way and I thought asking here could send me in the right direction.. maybe a better and open source app for voip service that can be paid for with a prepaid visa or
17:05:51 <jay46> something ??
17:12:59 <jpds> jay46: That's one for #grapheneos-offtopic
17:13:38 <jay46> I was just wonder that.. if it was related enough or off topic ..
17:22:24 <tom-griffin[m]> I heard of a story where law enforcement got signals message history on a locked smartphone would that be possible on graphene?

Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device.
18:15:36 <interesting[m]> this is from graphene os faq on encryption, what does "puttin at rest" mean? regarding profile

18:17:14 <strcat[m]> and you'd have to enter passphrase again for the OS to have it

18:20:21 <ulmirdin[m]> Does "putting at rest" happen by ending a secondary user session?
18:20:44 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "and you'd have to enter passphra"> I see
18:20:55 <timetravelingman> <ulmirdin[m] "Does "putting at rest" happen by"> Yes
18:22:41 <interesting[m]> I currently have all my apps, contacts and everything in the owner profile. is it unsafe? I better create another profile and install all apps and move all data there?
18:23:38 <strcat[m]> no it's not unsafe
18:23:42 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed just as well without profiles
18:24:07 <strcat[m]> profiles are to have isolated workspaces, as in no shared data / communication between them, and separate encryption keys for each
18:24:48 <interesting[m]> okay
18:58:03 <SRC> How does one roll back and update?
18:58:18 <SRC> *an update
18:59:34 <strcat[m]> can't
18:59:56 <strcat[m]> it's not possible in general since data gets migrated to new formats, etc. and it's also prevented for security reasons
19:00:00 <strcat[m]> it works the same way as it does in AOSP
19:00:40 <strcat[m]> the update system at a low level enforces downgrade protection: new build date must be newer than existing one or it rejects it, unless the update was explicitly marked and signed as a downgrade update
19:00:56 <strcat[m]> verified boot also provides downgrade protection and that's based on security patch level
19:01:10 <strcat[m]> but that's not reachable without the OS being exploited
19:01:22 <strcat[m]> or an an attacker trying to write stuff out to the SSD via physical access
19:01:59 <strcat[m]> verified boot is the final line of defense, to protect you from a deep form of persistent compromise after a remote exploit or via physical access
19:03:31 <SRC> I don't keep my data enabled at all times and yesterday when I turned it on it started automatically downloading something that said 'seamless client' and I turned it off again before it completed. Now any letters on a colored background like the clock and texts have a black border around it which is odd.
19:03:59 <SRC> Seems something was changed but it reboots normally
19:05:56 <strcat[m]> why would you cancel the update?
19:06:02 <strcat[m]> if you're not updating you're going to be insecure
19:06:22 <strcat[m]> sounds like you blocked the March security update
19:06:46 <SRC> I wanted to be sure it was a legitimate update being pushed to the phone for one thing
19:06:51 <strcat[m]> SRC: sounds like you enabled some weird accessibility stuff
19:07:05 <strcat[m]> SRC: I suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
19:07:27 <strcat[m]> SRC: updates are signed and verified with downgrade protection, the update server isn't a trusted party
19:07:51 <strcat[m]> SRC: https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog is a changelog and that page has an atom feed with the same content https://grapheneos.org/releases.atom
19:08:05 <strcat[m]> SRC: if you don't want updates from us... don't use GrapheneOS
19:08:16 <strcat[m]> you can disable updates... and you'll be insecure
19:08:20 <strcat[m]> so why use it at all in that case?
19:10:21 <SRC> I haven't yet read about the updates and it just caught be off guard so I wanted to verify first before letting it update. Just kind of a knee jerk reaction from having updates mess stuff up on other phones I've had.
19:10:49 <strcat[m]> > Now any letters on a colored background like the clock and texts have a black border around it which is odd.
19:11:01 <strcat[m]> this really sounds like you enabled an accessibility setting
19:11:03 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with an update
19:11:24 <strcat[m]> the more you tinker with stuff, the more problems you're going to have and generally you'll have less privacy and security too
19:11:27 <strcat[m]> the defaults are solid
19:12:13 <SRC> I haven't tinkered with anything to cause that to change
19:12:45 <strcat[m]> SRC: do you have dev options on?
19:12:54 <strcat[m]> SRC: try turning it off, which resets most of those dev option settings
19:13:22 <skagreek[m]> Are popular launchers fairly safe, especially with network blocked under settings?
19:13:43 <strcat[m]> skagreek: mostly the same question as with any other app
19:13:58 <strcat[m]> recommend using the standard launcher, it's not like it's missing anything essential
19:14:12 <skagreek[m]> True, thanks.
19:14:31 <SRC> I turned developer options off after installation per instructions
19:14:36 <strcat[m]> it's not like the keyboard where it'd be nice to use the OS one but it's not very good yet
19:15:04 <skagreek[m]> Yeah, gboard makes me so paranoid. lol
19:15:42 <mr_hebi_san[m]> How often is aosp keyboard improved?  I assume that with Gboard that Google has no interest in the stock IME
19:16:44 <dannyknoll3[m]> mr_hebi_san: What's there to improve?
19:17:08 <dannyknoll3[m]> I feel like the only one not hindered by it
19:17:28 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Emoji search?
19:17:57 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: it isn't actively developed, just bug fixes
19:18:07 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: it's assumed it will be replaced by an app chosen by the OEM
19:18:20 <skagreek[m]> got use to swipe, but not a big deal to be missing.
19:18:23 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Probably like the calendar
19:18:38 <strcat[m]> not quite like calendar
19:18:43 <strcat[m]> that exists solely for testing
19:18:52 <zzxx123> For me it would be non-Latin lanaguage support, swipe, and better themes
19:19:27 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Fair.  Aosp keyboard is at least useful for input instead of being read only
19:20:23 <interesting[m]> is "network-provided time" in  settings --> system --> date and time provided by graphene os? if I disable it phone will get time updates from cellular network instead. did I understand it correctly?
19:21:43 <zzxx123> <interesting[m] "is "network-provided time" in  s"> Yea GrapheneOS has it’s own time server
19:22:49 <interesting[m]> so I better leave it on then, so that time is fetched from graphene server right?
19:23:29 <strcat> interesting[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
19:24:36 <spart> guys how are you doing with that one app that requires play services or microg? in my case it is the banking app :(
19:24:51 <strcat[m]> use their website
19:25:09 <spart> website requires biometrics from phone :@
19:25:23 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding what that means
19:25:50 <johnk347[m]> Find a new bank.
19:25:54 <strcat[m]> it's not possible for an app or website to obtain a registered fingerprint
19:25:57 <strcat[m]> that's not what that means
19:26:10 <strcat[m]> even the OS doesn't have access to it
19:26:39 <strcat[m]> although we haven't yet added the planned feature of disabling fingerprint unlock while having one registered
19:26:40 <spart> no, it is an in-app two factor that can be used with biometrics as well
19:26:45 <strcat[m]> which is a feature supported for face unlock
19:27:25 <spart> and iḿ migrating from iphone, so iḿ not even sure how it does on android
19:27:30 <interesting[m]> <strcat "interesting: https://grapheneos."> yes that's what i'm reading. but I don't I still don't fully understand. what's "date header". do I leave "network-provided time" on? so that it keep fetching it from graphene server. or this settings mean it will fetch it from cellular network?
19:27:54 <strcat[m]> interesting: all covered in the section
19:27:56 <strcat[m]> read through it again
19:28:03 <strcat[m]> I don't think it will help to state the same stuff here
19:28:27 <strcat[m]> interesting: my suggestion is not to tinker with settings you don't understand, the defaults are solid
19:28:39 <strcat[m]> reconsider anything you might have already changed
19:29:36 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "interesting: my suggestion is no"> thanks
19:30:00 <interesting[m]> i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_dog.png
19:30:20 <spart> strcat[m] repetita iuvant
19:30:46 <spart> so, is anyone using microg at all?
19:31:33 <zzxx123> <interesting[m] "so I better leave it on then, so"> Do you trust getting time from GrapheneOS?
19:32:31 <interesting[m]> <zzxx123 "Do you trust getting time from G"> yes
19:32:54 <interesting[m]> that's what I wanted, instead of cellular network. I just double checked what that setting mean
19:36:33 <strcat[m]> interesting: we disable getting time from cellular or NTP and replace it with this
19:36:41 <strcat[m]> if you disable the setting, network time is just disabled
19:36:54 <strcat[m]> AOSP / stock OS prefer mobile network > NTP
19:37:15 <strcat[m]> because NTP is totally insecure, and mobile network is just insecure + unnecessarily trusted source for time
19:40:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​J1013Telegram> Would having a really slow Internet speed damage the updates?
19:40:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> No
19:44:31 <timetravelingman> Even if an update was damaged somehow, which isn't really even possible because of internet speed, it just wouldn't update and nothing would happen
19:45:53 <zzxx123> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<JJ1013Telegram> Would having a "> File integrity is checked by digital signature
19:46:11 <strcat> please read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
19:46:19 <strcat> if the update is corrupted/tampered it deletes it and will try again later
19:46:26 <strcat> but it's downloaded via HTTPS
19:46:36 <strcat> so it's not going to get corrupted unless you have faulty RAM or storage
19:46:45 <strcat> if the connection dies
19:46:48 <strcat> it resumes the download
19:46:51 <strcat> doesn't start over
19:48:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​J1013Telegram> That is really nice. 😁
19:51:18 <bill_in_mtl[m]> Just two quick comments.  1. Am very impressed with the speed of updates - especially security updates only days after the official release, and 2.  I've read through the FAQ and Wiki a few times now and not sure if I am not absorbing the info, but I understand better from the answers on this board.  Thank you for both !
19:52:35 <strcat> if you use the Beta channel to help with testing and reporting issues you'll get updates 1-2 days sooner
19:52:47 <strcat> don't use it simply to get them sooner though
19:52:50 <strcat> use it to hel
19:52:52 <strcat> help
19:53:55 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: are the beta channel releases, while potentially buggy still good for daily use ?
20:07:11 <strcat> yes
20:07:18 <strcat> they are also tested internally before going to Beta
20:07:28 <strcat> issues with them aren't really common
20:07:32 <strcat> nearly all end up going to Stable
20:09:10 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: since I am on stable now, I would need to flash a beta to be eligible for OTA's, correct ?
20:09:54 <strcat[m]> no
20:09:54 <jpds> bill_in_mtl[m]: No, you can just select beta and it'll pull down a beta OTA
20:10:04 <strcat[m]> it's the same OS, different release channel
20:10:08 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
20:10:17 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
20:10:28 <strcat[m]> a release goes through internal testing, then is pushed out via Beta, then is pushed out via Stable
20:10:33 <strcat[m]> it's the same release, same OS
20:10:43 <strcat[m]> release channels just determine how soon you get the update
20:11:00 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: my bad, I did read that and saw it on the screen
20:11:03 <strcat[m]> and if problems are found, the update would be cancelled and rebuilt + re-released via internal, then Beta, then it actually gets to Stable
20:11:22 <strcat[m]> the purpose of the internal testing and then Beta is to catch issues before the release is pushed out via Stable
20:11:34 <strcat[m]> most of the time, Beta and Stable have exactly the same release
20:11:42 <strcat[m]> it's only when a release is in progress that Beta is different
20:11:44 <strcat[m]> temporarily
20:12:10 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: feedback is processed how ?
20:12:31 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker
20:12:41 <strcat[m]> although we plan to make a separate tracker for non-bug-report Beta feedback
20:13:45 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: I believe I will give it a go, one way I can support
20:26:11 <SRC> I assume Graphene is way more secure than Lineage OS
20:27:02 <dannyknoll3[m]> <strcat "issues with them aren't really c"> I did not realize this. May switch to beta channel
20:27:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> huntell (@h​untell) has joined the Telegram Group!
20:28:30 <strcat[m]> SRC: we preserve the baseline privacy and security (quite contrary to how things work there) and focus on improving privacy/security substantially
20:28:37 <strcat[m]> SRC: please see https://grapheneos.org/features
20:28:43 <strcat[m]> please don't talk about other OSes here though
20:28:44 <strcat[m]> it's offtopic
20:29:08 <SRC> K thanks
20:34:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <J​J1013Telegram> I just learned the Google Pixel does not have its warranty void if the bootloader is unlocked.That is nice, for somebody who wants to install GrapheneOS on their device and still have it pure.
20:37:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Google might be a bich when it comes to privacy, they do know how to make great products
21:08:49 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Hey guys!
21:09:19 <Guest66694> hey friends - this is my first time using this. i need some help troubleshooting my new pixel 5 installation of grapheneOS. anyone around here that can lend a hand?
21:09:44 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Has GrapheneOS a function random mix the numbers on lockscreen pin entry?
21:10:28 <strcat[m]> yes
21:10:33 <interesting[m]> <tgasdgasdhr45zd "Has GrapheneOS a function random"> there's pin scramble option
21:10:36 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
21:10:46 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Oh cool, thank you :)
21:11:17 <Guest66694> When I was trying to flash the newest release 'redfin' i was able to get to the point where i was flashing the new build
21:13:26 <Guest66694> when i ran flash-all.bat the command line would open and immediately close and not run any commands. i opened it with wordpad and individually input all the commands in the command line. all of them seemed to work fine, but when i had entered the last one and i tried to start the new OS , the bootloader screen would just go black for a second and
21:13:26 <Guest66694> then go right back to the bootloader screen and not start the OS. any ideas?
21:14:25 <nscnt[m]> Guest66694: Following the official guide would be a good first step
21:15:53 <nscnt[m]> Consider using the WebUSB-based installer. There's not much reason not to if you're on Windows
21:18:42 <Guest66694> i tried my best to use the installation guide on the official page. i could not get it to work so i looked elsewhere. i did not try the webUSB. thank you for the recommendation i will try that.
21:38:29 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> How can other Custom-ROMs can "update" security patch level for old devices? Is this kind of "fake" or not the whole truth? If I understand right, security patch of Pixel 2 will stay on 11.2020 even if you further support it..
21:38:48 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: they don't, they just lie
21:39:06 <strcat[m]> the overall security patch level covers everything, not just AOSP patches
21:39:11 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Oh, straight words :)
21:39:15 <strcat[m]> nearly every alternate OS lies about the patch level
21:39:22 <strcat[m]> and they are aware they are lying, but do it for promotion/marketing reasons
21:39:31 <strcat[m]> and they harm users since the users don't know they are insecure
21:39:44 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> So it is basically a string which can be set to whatever one want..
21:39:54 <strcat[m]> yes nothing checks it, you're just supposed to be honest
21:40:10 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> That's why I'm asking cause I'm caring about security lately..
21:40:18 <strcat[m]> the monthly AOSP updates increment it but if the device doesn't provide that patch level you're supposed to set it to the actual provided patch level
21:40:24 <strcat[m]> so, that's what we do
21:40:29 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Thinking of selling all my android phones and just get pixel in the future..
21:40:32 <strcat[m]> we have a Pixel 2 branch we create based on the main branch
21:40:41 <strcat[m]> and the MAIN thing it does is setting patch level string back to actual value it provides
21:40:50 <strcat[m]> along with adding back the old AOSP repos for Pixel 2 which were dropped
21:41:14 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_build/commit/241572d02d8d7aa533b06ce08bb7aa5e563ba2e5
21:41:44 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: if we didn't need to do this it could really just be in the same branch, although it may need hacks sometimes and we do not want to have the actual official OS having hacks to support legacy devices
21:42:41 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Sounds good, thanks for the detailed explanation!
21:43:06 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Are you one of the devs?
21:43:10 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to do a small subset of the device-specific patches Pixel 2 needs
21:43:11 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: yes
21:43:25 <strcat[m]> but basically it's not a good use of resources and is not actually something that can be done beyond a small subset
21:43:30 <strcat[m]> cannot get new firmware
21:43:35 <strcat[m]> cannot realistically fully maintain all the kernel drivers
21:43:56 <gamrix> Pixel 3a will be soon in the same case ?
21:44:02 <strcat[m]> cannot realistically maintain all the userspace stuff especially when closed source stuff would need to be binary patched, rewritten or replaced with available open source reimplementations
21:44:38 <strcat[m]> gamrix: I mean, it depends how you define soon
21:44:40 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Of course..
21:44:51 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> May 2022 if I'm right..
21:45:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices is a really strong recommendation to only buy 4a, 4a (5G) and 5
21:45:05 <strcat[m]> and a big reason for that is support time
21:45:19 <strcat[m]> > The recommended devices with the best hardware, firmware and software security along with the longest future support time are the Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5. We strongly recommend against purchasing older devices. The Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 will likely be supported for at least a bit longer than the Pixel 4a.
21:45:49 <gamrix> yeah i understand it, but i have a pixel 3a xD So, GrapheneOS can maintain the pixel in the same date of Google ?
21:46:08 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Pixel 4a (5G) has the longest support from google
21:46:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Kind of useless if you only use wifi though
21:46:52 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> GrapheneOS-Teleg ?
21:47:11 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> What is useless if only using wifi?
21:47:18 <strcat[m]> gamrix: you can see what we've done for the Pixel 2
21:47:43 <strcat[m]> gamrix: we provided all the upstream updates and then continued doing an unofficial ESR branch for it providing partial security updates, while setting an honest security patch level documenting it is insecure
21:48:10 <gamrix> Ok so better than no security at all like Google, thanks!
21:48:24 <strcat[m]> it isn't really much better than nothing
21:48:31 <strcat[m]> we don't want people to think that it is
21:48:51 <strcat[m]> once devices are EOL I would really recommend moving to a current gen budget device
21:48:54 <strcat[m]> currently 4a
21:48:56 <strcat[m]> soon 5a
21:50:03 <gamrix> Ok!
21:51:24 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Are there any encrypted messengers which you guys recommend? (myself started using threema as they opensourced it lately)
21:55:50 <zzxx123> <tgasdgasdhr45zd "Are there any encrypted messenge"> Signal is the default answer
21:57:16 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Okay, also Signal user for years but I hate providing a phone number for it to work.. Kind of kills anonymity in my oppinion..
21:58:01 <b1101> you're not anonymous. your messages are just encrypted
21:58:24 <b1101> the signal servers still have a record of who contacted who, they just don't know wtf they said
21:58:25 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> I know that's what I said.. But I think with Threema I could go anonymous..
21:59:00 <zzxx123> Use Telegram or Matrix with internet people
21:59:08 <zzxx123> Signal isn’t for that
21:59:26 <strcat[m]> Signal is to replace carrier calls and texts
21:59:31 <strcat[m]> for your contacts you have using phone numbers
21:59:45 <strcat[m]> it's to totally migrate away from carrier calls/texts
21:59:46 <strcat[m]> every contact
21:59:47 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Okay, don't see any advantage of Telegram over Signal cause I have to provide phone number too
22:00:09 <b1101> also telegram has cloud blackups of everything don't they?
22:00:23 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Using Telegram too but only for tech talk..
22:00:32 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Not for private communication..
22:00:37 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: do carrier calls have to be from one signal user to another ?
22:01:33 <strcat[m]> bill.in.mtl: I don't understand the question
22:01:40 <zzxx123> <tgasdgasdhr45zd "Okay, don't see any advantage of"> the advantage over Signal is you don’t have to give your phone to random
22:01:43 <strcat[m]> Signal doesn't do carrier-based calls and texts, it's a replacement for it
22:01:48 <strcat[m]> that's what I'm saying
22:02:03 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> @zzxx123 ah I see but I have to give it to them..
22:02:05 <strcat[m]> the purpose of Signal is to replace carrier-based calls/texts where all the carriers are trusted and can see all data and metadata
22:02:13 <strcat[m]> the point is that you install it
22:02:13 <zzxx123> * the advantage over Signal is you don’t have to give your phone number to random people
22:02:26 <strcat[m]> tell all your contacts in the phone number address book to install it
22:02:31 <strcat[m]> and then you use that for your texts and calls
22:02:42 <strcat[m]> it's to bring end to end encryption to the existing social network of phone number contacts
22:02:47 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> @zzxx123 I meant you have to give it to Telegram..
22:03:07 <bill_in_mtl[m]> okay I think I get it, but the encrypted part is only between signal users, right ?
22:03:33 <strcat[m]> where data is end-to-end encrypted, metadata is extremely limited (end to end encryption covers profiles, etc. too) and the remaining metadata isn't available to carriers, etc.
22:03:50 <strcat[m]> bill.in.mtl: Signal call only call another Signal user, or text another Signal user (unless you make it your SMS app, which I wouldn't recommend)
22:04:00 <strcat[m]> bill.in.mtl: you need to get your contacts to install it
22:04:02 <strcat[m]> it's not hard to do
22:05:23 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: agreed, tried to get contacts to install it - that did not go very well.  So, for regular SMS, while not recommeded - the stock app is as good as any ?
22:05:41 <strcat[m]> yes
22:05:48 <strcat[m]> you could install a fancier SMS app but you should be avoiding SMS
22:05:59 <strcat[m]> so I'm not sure it's a good thing to make it fancier and nicer to use
22:05:59 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> SMS is the worst shit
22:06:11 <strcat[m]> I haven't ever had trouble getting ppl to use Signal
22:06:41 <strcat[m]> my lawyer already had Signal, we started out with it
22:07:00 <strcat[m]> just about the only thing I get via SMS is spam or notifications from some business like a dental office
22:07:12 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: tbh, my family - which is for the most part my contacts think I have fallen down a rabbit hole with all the privacy stuff 😄
22:07:24 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> I tried to get a friend to install Signal, took me half an hour he was not convinced.. Then I mentioned Snowden.. Guess what?
22:07:45 <zzxx123> <tgasdgasdhr45zd "I tried to get a friend to insta"> Still not convinced
22:07:46 <strcat[m]> you need to do a better job convincing them
22:07:57 <strcat[m]> tell them the people working at the carriers are likely looking through their texts and otherwise abusing their powers
22:08:03 <strcat[m]> link them to stories about that kind of stuff happening
22:08:40 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: agreed, that's why I'm here - learning and getting info together
22:08:44 <strcat[m]> https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/home-alarm-tech-backdoored-security-cameras-to-spy-on-customers-having-sex/
22:08:47 <strcat[m]> there you go
22:08:48 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> strcat[m] I agree it is not the best idea to set signal as sms app but it helps to convice people, cause it doesn't feel like having another messenger when you hide sms app afterwards..
22:08:55 <strcat[m]> tell them people who work at carriers are like that too
22:09:05 <strcat[m]> now you have the easy ticket to getting ppl to install Signal
22:09:12 <strcat[m]> they don't care about government mass surveillance etc.
22:09:19 <strcat[m]> they will care about some perv looking at their texts
22:09:53 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Good Idea, but for most of my contacts Elon did the dirty work lately.. :'D
22:10:02 <strcat[m]> they trust not just their own carrier, or even just their carrier + the carrier of the other person but other carriers too, by using carrier-based texts
22:10:17 <strcat[m]> they trust all those people working there with access to it or who could obtain access
22:10:22 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: I know it's off topic, but majority of family are apple users - is their messaging system any more secure than android ?
22:11:02 <strcat[m]> iMessage has end-to-end encryption but in a normal configuration most users have automatic backup to iCloud (not E2E encrypted)
22:11:16 <strcat[m]> and that's only for messages between Apple users
22:11:32 <strcat[m]> and there are a lot more weaknesses in it
22:11:42 <zzxx123> 'We Spoke To a Guy Who Got His Dick Locked In a Cage By a Hacker' https://m.slashdot.org/story/381304
22:11:55 <gamrix[m]> What is the problem to use signal at default SMS app ?
22:12:36 <strcat[m]> gamrix: I recommend not mixing insecure messaging with secure
22:12:37 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> You could send a sms by mistake!
22:12:42 <strcat[m]> and focus on avoiding insecure messaging
22:12:50 <strcat[m]> also Signal is not actually very good as an SMS bug and has some major bugs
22:12:57 <strcat[m]> and it's really not a priority for them to fix / improve SMS
22:13:05 <strcat[m]> so if you actually want a good SMS app using Signal is not that
22:13:12 <strcat[m]> not that a good SMS app can even exist
22:13:18 <strcat[m]> because SMS is so trash in every way
22:13:22 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: so the back-up feature is where they drop their security ?  I can use that
22:13:30 <strcat[m]> bill.in.mtl: not the only way
22:13:49 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> They tried to improve it back in the days with "TextSecure" but saidly there is no encrypted SMS anymore in Signal..
22:13:50 <strcat[m]> one of them though, yeah
22:14:02 <strcat[m]> encrypted SMS Is just not a good idea (anymore)
22:14:10 <strcat[m]>  * encrypted SMS is just not a good idea (anymore)
22:14:15 <strcat[m]> still gives the metadata to the carriers
22:14:29 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> I know but it is better than unencrypted sms
22:14:32 <strcat[m]> and it's a really bad experience with desync issues, all the usual issues of SMS delivery, slow messages, etc.
22:14:39 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: and it only works if you can get them to install the app
22:14:43 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> If there is a rare situation where a sms is the only way..
22:14:46 <strcat[m]> so what's the point?
22:14:54 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: for 4G and later, SMS just goes over data anyway
22:14:55 <gamrix[m]> OK thanks !
22:15:15 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: there's only non-data-based SMS for 2G/3G
22:15:25 <strcat[m]> 2G is quickly on the way out now
22:15:27 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Okay
22:15:36 <strcat[m]> and 3G will fade away too
22:15:57 <strcat[m]> anyway even if you don't have 4G access everywhere... data works fine on 2G/3G
22:16:13 <usernumber33[m]> If we changed the default settings in vanadium is there a way to reset to the default?
22:16:17 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> So SMS = obsolete
22:16:19 <strcat[m]> just pointing out non-data-based SMS doesn't even exist for modern networks
22:16:26 <strcat[m]> usernumber33: clear app data will wipe everything
22:16:43 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: yes, SMS is obsolete as long as you can get people to install a compatible messaging app
22:16:50 <usernumber33[m]> Thank you
22:16:52 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: SMS is just a universal, really horrible fallback
22:17:09 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: i.e. if you have a phone number you can send an SMS
22:17:27 <strcat[m]> RCS is a modern replacement for SMS but it has the same flaw of being carrier-based and trusting them
22:17:33 <strcat[m]> and Apple is unlikely to implement it
22:17:50 <strcat[m]> and thanks to being carrier-based, it's a mess of non-interoperable implementations/networks atm
22:18:05 <strcat[m]> with varying feature support, some only work within the same carrier, etc.
22:18:09 <strcat[m]> RCS seems really pointless
22:18:13 <strcat[m]> just use Signal
22:18:28 <strcat[m]> we're fairly likely to disable the OS RCS support completely
22:18:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> If anything
22:18:48 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> I see so I'm going for signal with my primary phone and for anonymous communication threema in combination with vpn and public wifi on another phone without sim..
22:18:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> RCS can cause more complexity
22:18:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> And sometimes cause messages to be lost
22:19:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because the other party can deregister from it and it won't reflect on the other side for a while
22:19:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Because the other party can deregister from it and it won't reflect on your side for a while
22:19:46 <strcat[m]> my recommendation is use Signal as your way of dealing with normal people and just force them to get it
22:19:58 <strcat[m]> and then you can use something else for technical people and people you meet online
22:20:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> points gun install signal, or else...
22:20:09 <strcat[m]>  * my recommendation is use Signal as your way of dealing with most people and just force them to get it
22:21:07 <bill_in_mtl[m]> strcat: thanks for the recommendations
22:21:13 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Yeah my initial question targeted the "something else for technical people and people you meet online" category
22:21:39 <strcat[m]> I would still use something using the Signal protocol so you still have forward secrecy, etc.
22:21:39 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Using Signal for years instead of SMS and Whatsapp (which is main messenger in my country)ä
22:22:08 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> You ever heard of threema?
22:22:58 <skwisgaar[m]> strcat: could you explain in a bit more detail why I wouldn’t want to have a VPN running on one profile but not another? Was thinking about your answer from the other day and I’m still confused why that could be an issue. Wouldn’t that depend on the purpose of using the VPN?
22:23:03 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> https://threema.ch/en/open-source
22:26:12 <strcat[m]> skwisgaar: sure but the VPN of the currently active profile applies to everything
22:26:16 <strcat[m]> it may not work the way you think
22:27:14 <skwisgaar[m]> Ohh I was not aware of that. So in a secondary profile, using a VPN will route all OS data through it?
22:27:16 <strcat[m]> the currently active profile gets to set up the network unless the user management stuff has been used to disable that
22:27:21 <strcat[m]> skwisgaar: yes
22:27:35 <strcat[m]> and similarly other network changes like which Wi-Fi network you're using is global
22:28:20 <strcat[m]> VPN functionality could get more advanced particularly around profiles
22:28:23 <strcat[m]> but that's how it works atm
22:28:43 <strcat[m]> largely based on how it works in the linux kernel without using network namespaces for everything
22:29:08 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Is tor integration a future topic?
22:29:46 <strcat[m]> no
22:29:48 <skwisgaar[m]> Ok I was confused then. Thanks for clearing that up.
22:29:51 <strcat[m]> it doesn't need to be integrated in the OS
22:29:58 <strcat[m]> the VPN service feature serves that purpose
22:30:21 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Okay and is TOR over VPN possible?
22:30:24 <strcat[m]> VPN service feature + block traffic not via VPN
22:30:28 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: it's not "over VPN"
22:30:32 <strcat[m]> it's "via VPN service feature"
22:30:44 <strcat[m]> the VPN service feature provides the ability for an app to route all traffic through itself
22:30:48 <strcat[m]> recommend reading our FAQ
22:30:58 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
22:31:09 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Okay, will read it!
22:37:05 <donkykong[m]> I mainly use the user profile
22:37:06 <donkykong[m]> Should I set the VPN in owner or user profile?
22:39:04 <strcat[m]> start by setting it up in owner
22:39:09 <strcat[m]> and then you can play around with that and see how it works
22:42:05 <spamx101[m]> What messengers would be more appropriate for technical people that still use the Signal protocol w/ forward secrecy, etc.?
22:42:27 <donkykong[m]> What's the advantage of having it set into owner rather then the user one with the apps I use daily?
22:42:44 <spamx101[m]> <spamx101[m] "What messengers would be more ap"> Off-topic but replying to the thread above
22:45:21 <bizanon[m]> If you enable hotspot WiFi, does the cell carrier ever get info on Mac addresses of devices connecting to the hotspot?
22:47:21 <strcat[m]> donkykong: I'm just suggesting doing that to learn how it works
22:54:37 <bizanon[m]> strcat:  can you answer my question when u get a chance pls 🙏
22:55:22 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's a misguided question
22:55:25 <strcat[m]> and don't need to ping me
22:55:29 <strcat[m]> other people can answer too
22:55:42 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi is over-the-air radio traffic
22:55:48 <strcat[m]> anyone can see which devices are talking to which devices
22:56:00 <strcat[m]> no, the OS does not tell your carrier which devices connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot, no reason it would do that
22:56:06 <strcat[m]> but it's visible over-the-air as Wi-Fi traffic
22:56:18 <bizanon[m]> OK got it thank yoi
22:56:23 <bizanon[m]> * OK got it thank you
22:56:23 <strcat[m]> although read https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
22:56:27 <strcat[m]> about Wi-Fi privacy in general
23:01:43 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Did you guys heard about EncroPhone / EncroChat?
23:05:19 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> I mean it is a crazy story, why would all those criminals with tons of money use such a untrusty thing?
23:06:45 <strcat[m]> most privacy and security products (and even open source projects) don't have substance
23:06:58 <strcat[m]> and are often some form of scam
23:07:16 <strcat[m]> tgasdgasdhr45zd: people are *still* buying phones from sketchy 'secure phone' companies
23:07:20 <strcat[m]> didn't learn their lesson
23:14:45 <jay46> whats the recommended email client to use with grapheneos?
23:15:41 <snooopy> strcat[m]: Yeah, sadly, "security" is used too often in marketing :/
23:16:18 <madaidan[m]> <tgasdgasdhr45zd "I mean it is a crazy story, why "> They're stupid
23:17:29 <strcat[m]> jay46: we don't really have a recommendation ourselves but there are a couple popular open source apps used by a lot of people in the community
23:18:20 <jay46> thought that might be the answer, being I didnt read anything specifically. K9 seems to be mentioned more than the others.
23:19:01 <strcat[m]> FairEmail is popular among our users
23:19:06 <strcat[m]> we don't have a specific recommendation
23:19:23 <jay46> i read of it too. Ill check it out more. Thank you.
23:19:24 <snooopy> jay46: Try and look what feels better for you
23:21:48 <jay46> The goal is to make the shift on my pixel 5 this weekend from stock to grapheneos. Did i understand correctly from the faq the idea is to not really use the admin user, and pretty much for any use immediately switch to another user.
23:22:26 <strcat[m]> jay46: it's fine to use the Owner profile
23:22:33 <strcat[m]> the issue is not that the Owner profile is privileged
23:22:57 <strcat[m]> jay46: but rather, there is an advantage to using secondary profiles which can be put at rest with end session, rather than rebooting
23:23:02 <strcat[m]> that's all we say in the FAQ on encryption
23:23:17 <strcat[m]> and also when booting up the device you must unlock Owner
23:23:25 <strcat[m]> and as implied above, it remains active until reboot
23:23:37 <strcat[m]> that's what we try to explain the encryption faq section
23:23:49 <strcat[m]> you can decide what makes sense for you
23:26:59 <jay46> I am currently using protonvpn. .. Am i right that I have to install that in each user? That you cannot just have it setup in the admin to cover system wide such as in the background?
23:54:39 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <jay46 "I am currently using protonvpn. "> Yes, that's correct
23:54:54 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> You can simply check the external IP of the user to see if VPN is used..
23:55:39 <strcat[m]> jay46: try installing it owner to start, set it as always on VPN there
23:55:41 <strcat[m]> jay46: and try it out
23:55:53 <jay46> will do.. thank you..
23:57:04 <tgasdgasdhr45zd> Good night guys and thank you strcat[m] for your time.. Great project btw..
23:57:42 <strcat[m]> jay46: also always use always-on VPN mode (it's simply implied for ipsec support etc. that's built in)
23:58:15 <strcat[m]> which blocks traffic not going through the app (such as before the app starts, if the app service dies, etc.)
23:58:37 <jay46> I always have it set to always on.
23:58:51 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/vpn#service
23:58:54 <strcat[m]> this explains it a bit
23:59:44 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/vpn#always-on
