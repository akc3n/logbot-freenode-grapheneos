00:00:39 <jj1013[m]> I see.
00:00:54 <retracey[m]> Do you recommend Vanadium? Or should I go with firefox
00:00:57 <jj1013[m]> In the end, did you have to do signature spoofing or?
00:01:02 <retracey[m]> I can't seem to set searx as a default search engine
00:01:23 <retracey[m]> <jj1013[m] "In the end, did you have to do s"> I had just installed MicroG and it worked. I remember signature spoofing not being enabled but it is uninstalled now
00:01:34 <jj1013[m]> <retracey[m] "Do you recommend Vanadium? Or sh"> Vanadium is best.
00:02:09 <retracey[m]> That's a real problem with firefox on andorid? How have I not heard of that
00:02:14 <jj1013[m]> <retracey[m] "I had just installed MicroG and "> Would suggest factory-reset or reflash to make sure you got rid of that thing.
00:03:05 <jj1013[m]> <retracey[m] "That's a real problem with firef"> You probably have been around in r/degoogle or privacy enthusiasts, but apart from privacy there should also be security, which they don't mind about. That's why they prefer using things such as LineageOS or Linux phones.
00:03:43 <jj1013[m]> Madaidan suggests using Chromium instead of Firefox due to its great sandbox design.
00:03:59 <jj1013[m]> Chromium can be degoogled by merely changing the You & Google options, according to him.
00:05:12 <jj1013[m]> Forks such as ungoogled-chromium are not recommended because they lag behind on updates (which are important for security), and in the case of ungoogled-chromium, all you get is a simple default config change.
00:05:14 <retracey[m]> <jj1013[m] "You probably have been around in"> Actually no, I came here because I am interested in Linux/FOSS and my google phone was bugging me lol. I am a complete noob to android and android tweaking. What even are the benefits of graphene over something like LineageOS? Just the de-googling?
00:06:30 <jj1013[m]> <retracey[m] "Actually no, I came here because"> GrapheneOS has Verified Boot, so in case you install a compromised update, the device does not boot.
00:06:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> Firefox has significantly more issues than just the broken sandboxing.
00:06:50 <jj1013[m]> You don't need to tweak security settings ─ all the security stuff is handled in the background.
00:06:57 <strcat[m]> jj1013.: you can't install a compromised update, there are signature checks
00:07:00 <jj1013[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<madaidan> Firefox has significa"> Such as the horrible memory leakage.
00:07:01 <strcat[m]> that's not the purpose of verified boot
00:07:19 <jj1013[m]> <strcat[m] "jj1013.: you can't install a com"> Oh, yes ─ the system also checks the updates' signatures.

03:39:51 <retracey[m]> Is there any google spyware possibility if I use gboard with network permissions off
03:51:22 <somenerd[m]> If there are any other google apps on your phone with network access, they could exfiltrate data through IPC
03:52:45 <somenerd[m]> If you distrust gboard completely (assuming it’s malicious, not just privacy invading), then it’s not a good idea to use it as your keyboard
04:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> retracey[m]: somenerd[m] nailed it. The Network toggle is NOT meant to allow you to use apps you don't trust in place of highly privileged system utilities such as the keyboard. Never do this.
04:11:00 <TheJollyRoger> qubits: GrapheneOS isolates the devices attached to the host via system memory management. It's not 2010 anymore.

06:50:30 <christhepanda[m]> Yes. https://developers.google.com/android/images
06:51:30 <Thor[m]> OK, thanks! Just wanted to make sure that I can sell the device again
06:51:47 <christhepanda[m]> Yup.
06:53:55 <Thor[m]> Currently I'm using a Sony Xperia XA2 (Snapdragon 630) with Sailfish OS, but I'm not satisfied with the speed of the device (browsers are slow). I guess the Pixel 4a would be far ahead.
07:17:31 <christhepanda[m]> It is great.
08:14:44 <fakhx[m]> Is it just me or the phone is charging slowly after last update ? (It says 11 hrs until full now) and im using 18w usb c charger
08:16:10 <christhepanda[m]> Which one?
08:21:27 <fakhx[m]> Are you asking which phone or which update ? , 4 xl , latest update , but it might have been something in the port obstructing , basic PEBCAK lol
08:28:34 <christhepanda[m]> Which phone
08:29:44 <christhepanda[m]> I find a basic alcohol port flushing could help. Isopropyl alcohole on a q tip and then stick it in front of the fan for a minute could help.
08:36:11 <strcat[m]> based on their behavior in offtopic, @christhepanda:matrix.org is clearly a troll who was here to spread attacks on the project from a YouTube influencer who publishes misrepresentations and misinformation about the project
08:42:20 <fakhx[m]> I used a toothpick to clean the port , it doesnt seem anything was in the port , im still getting very slow charging though  (says charging rapidly 4 hrs until full ) , although i am using quality usb cable and charger (that worked perfectly before and still work with other devices)
08:42:20 <fakhx[m]> Anyone else having slow charge issue ?
08:42:20 <fakhx[m]> or/and is there a way to troubleshoot the battery ?

08:56:23 <strcat[m]> it's likely they're one of the people doing it elsewhere too
08:56:54 <strcat[m]> in my experience people who do this stuff are quite prolific with it and if they use 1 sockpuppet they probably have many more
08:58:06 <strcat[m]> a small group of people have serious obsessions with causing harm to the project and unfortunately they work together and coordinate creating false narratives and misinformation to cause damage
09:06:36 <strcat[m]> ban evasion from another sockpuppet, they say they'll stop but that would be a shock

09:48:05 <bar37> what should i do?
09:50:20 <Pratyush[m]> i am bit confused. you are trying to install Graphene os on pixel 5 using web installer and it's keep saying "download" again and again.
09:50:21 <Pratyush[m]> right ?
09:54:16 <bar37> yes
09:56:18 <Pratyush[m]> may be device is getting disconnected during download
09:57:01 <Pratyush[m]> make sure once unlocked, device stay connected while download complete
09:57:53 <Pratyush[m]> and may be consider using original usb cable and direct connect to pc/laptop
10:04:27 <bar37> thats what i have been doing but it still asks me to download the release before flash and i have been doing that
10:08:00 <Pratyush[m]> i not sure why, can you send a screenshot of error or something ? may be check browser console for error if there is any
10:09:57 <helloworldkk87[m> You are trting to flash Pixel device right? bar37

10:19:27 <strcat[m]> it didn't
10:19:31 <strcat[m]> you did something and wrongly think it helped
10:19:38 <helloworldkk87[m> Right
10:19:40 <strcat[m]> the update was probably just not pushed out to the channel yet
10:20:08 <strcat[m]> need to also realize there are multiple update servers now, not just 1, and the replicas have to sync from the main one
10:20:28 <helloworldkk87[m> Right got it
10:20:42 <strcat[m]> if you disable the app it stops the update check job
10:20:46 <strcat[m]> same as force stop
10:21:12 <strcat[m]> Zwiebel: make sure the updater is enabled, make sure you haven't disallowed it from running through the settings and reboot
10:21:31 <strcat[m]> Zwiebel: check the version of the OS that you're on after rebooting and check the version in the channel you're using
10:21:40 <strcat[m]> Zwiebel: and keep in mind it only runs in the Owner profile not secondary ones

14:48:05 <strcat[m]> jackson: it doesn't seem they support it with arbitrary devices if it doesn't work
14:48:08 <strcat[m]> which carrier is it?
14:51:48 <jackson[m]> it's a carrier in europe. they said that it should be supported.
14:52:17 <strcat[m]> we have good support for VoLTE and VoWiFi with non-US carriers

15:10:23 <GhostSplinterSix> I appreciate the response. It's Google, so I wanted to ask first, hah...
15:14:16 <Baloo> does GrapheneOS have support for esim yet?

15:21:14 <cacheline> Just installed GrapheneOS on my new device.  Where's a reliable link for downloading the Aurora app store apk?
15:23:01 <came2complain[m]> aurora-bd.gov.cn
15:23:33 <covid-1984[m]> <came2complain[m] "aurora-bd.gov.cn"> are you joking?
15:23:45 <cacheline> covid-1984[m] yeah, I'm not that gullible :-P
15:23:50 <covid-1984[m]> must be :)
15:23:57 <covid-1984[m]> All good, I like humor
15:24:13 <cacheline> I'm trying a link from f-droid.org
15:28:02 <Baloo> only place you should be downloading APKs is through F-Droid
15:32:32 <entry1> <Baloo "only place you should be downloa"> Plenty of other alternatives to F-Droid
15:35:15 <cacheline> I plan to just use Aurora to make my life easier :-P
15:35:51 <cacheline> My only concern is as an app dev, what will that do for when I need to test an app with GMS type stuff.  Might need to stick to emulator only.
15:39:00 <helloworldkk87[m> <Baloo "only place you should be downloa"> F-Droid is not recommended. This is due to F-Droid having accumulated large numbers of apps that are now unmaintained and target much older versions of the Android API all the way back to before Android 6, and not warning the user that the apps are written and compiled for older versions of Android.
15:39:49 <Baloo> so where do you all get FOSS apps without the security issues?
15:40:07 <Baloo> I've been using a combination of F-Droid and Aurora store for 3 years now
15:41:15 <helloworldkk87[m> Aurora store is a good place. And foss doesnt mean private/secure. I do personally use fdroid (FoxyDroid) but its just not recommended
15:43:57 <cacheline> Does the default keyboard have a swype type feature?
15:49:08 <signalarch[m]> <cacheline "Does the default keyboard have a"> It does not
15:51:23 <cacheline> Bummer.  I was hoping it had something privacy minded that could do the basics
15:52:19 <cacheline> Also, I'm seeing exactly how many of my normal apps have "Requires GSF" in the Aurora store.  What's the recommended approach if you really need such apps and there's not security/privacy minded alternatives or web interfaces that'll work well?
15:53:06 <helloworldkk87[m> Usually just some features in those apps are broken
15:53:12 <helloworldkk87[m> Like maps or logins
15:53:36 <ananteris[m]> It doesn't look like disabling network for an app actually blocks it from internet access.. What does it do then?
15:53:38 <cacheline> OK, so what if a particular feature I need is broken though?  Should I setup a specific user profile to use them in and sorta-kinda sandbox it?
15:54:21 <cacheline> ananteris[m] maybe it means no access to cellular networks, but WiFi is still allowed?  That's a total guess on my part though, lacking more context.
15:55:12 <ananteris[m]> That's not the case actually, they still have access over mobile data.. at least in my testing
15:55:48 <helloworldkk87[m> <cacheline "OK, so what if a particular feat"> Profiles wont offer stronger sandbox. All apps are sandboxed anyways. The only solution for broken apps is wait or help make the Play services compatibility layer
15:56:52 <cacheline> helloworldkk87[m I was using "sandboxed" loosely.  I'm aware that apps live in a sandbox from each other & all that. ;-)
15:57:27 <helloworldkk87[m> Roger that
15:57:56 <cacheline> What dialer apps do y'all tend to use?  Trying to look for an alternative that's private/secure, but also usable.
15:58:18 <cacheline> Same question on contacts too... THAT much, I could write an app for myself, but I'd rather not take the time to do so :-P
16:04:46 <cacheline> helloworldkk87[m where do I find info on helping with the GSF compatibility layer?
16:11:46 <helloworldkk87[m> <cacheline "helloworldkk87 where do I find i"> I think in their Github https://github.com/GrapheneOS
16:12:05 <akc3n[m]> <cacheline "helloworldkk87 where do I find i"> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/204

16:13:05 <ananteris[m]> "GrapheneOS adds a user-facing Network permission toggle providing a robust way to deny both direct and indirect network access to applications. It builds upon the standard non-user-facing INTERNET permission, so it's already fully adopted by the app ecosystem. Revoking the permission denies indirect access via OS components and apps enforcing the INTERNET permission, such as DownloadManager. Direct access is denied
16:13:05 <ananteris[m]> by blocking low-level network socket access."
16:13:17 <ananteris[m]> This is broken AF
16:20:40 <dazinism> ananteris: it does block an app getting network access. Another app with network access can still relay a network connection for the blocked app.
16:22:20 <cacheline> thanks all
16:22:31 <dazinism> The app with network access would have to be going out of its way to enable this, or be poorly implemented
16:25:59 <dazinism> ananteris: guess its most likely that the two apps are from the same developer. Interesting you are seeing this. What app?
16:26:15 <ananteris[m]> dazinism: every single app I've tested still gets network access
16:26:24 <dazinism> Theres stuff you can run to see which apps are making connections
16:26:45 <ananteris[m]> Maybe that's because I have a VPN enabled?
16:26:47 <dazinism> ananteris: weird. Works fine for me
16:27:32 <dazinism> ananteris:  I really don't think a VPN would make a difference
16:29:02 <dazinism> ananteris: actually maybe a VPN app could have stuff poorly implemented. Which VPN app are you using?
16:29:19 <ananteris[m]> let me try a relogin.. Tor browser works for example.. 4chan reader, google translate
16:29:23 <dazinism> Theres many been found to be rubbish or just plain malware
16:31:06 <ananteris[m]> That doesn't explain an OS level isolation failing
16:31:28 <ananteris[m]> If the malware works.. GrapheneOS network perms have failed
16:32:07 <ananteris[m]> There should be warnings on the wiki
16:32:21 <ananteris[m]> That it doesn't actually provide hard isolation from the internet
16:32:34 <dazinism> Installing dodgy apps on any android device and granting them the powers they need to do dodgy stuff will get any android device owned
16:33:12 <dazinism> By granting an app power to act as your VPN you give it complete control of your network
16:33:21 <ananteris[m]> Which permission would those apps need?
16:33:34 <ananteris[m]> Its probably openvpn then
16:34:02 <dazinism> You are using the official openvpn app?
16:35:02 <ananteris[m]> The only special perm openvpn has is network access
16:35:18 <ananteris[m]> I'm using the open source one from the google store if that's what you mean
16:35:27 <dazinism> You are using the official openvpn app? Where did you get it from?
16:35:48 <dazinism> You got it using Aurora Store?
16:36:33 <ananteris[m]> Yeah, its signed nonetheless but I got it from aurora
16:45:38 <catfish[m]> ananteris: other users have had this issue https://matrix.to/#/!omAJrepvwSfkXJrqbK:matrix.org/$16182709765933727bRRtj:matrix.org?
17:06:42 <ananteris[m]> None of those things I have modified, AFAIK I haven't messed with anything crazy either
17:06:54 <ananteris[m]> There really should be a warning on the wiki a out tgat
17:07:04 <ananteris[m]> * There really should be a warning on the wiki a out that
17:07:51 <ananteris[m]> I can try an app perm reset across my profiles but if that doesn't fix it it really shouldn't be listed as a feature
17:09:01 <strcat[m]> it's not broken as far as we know
17:09:14 <strcat[m]> users change things with adb and Settings which break the permission model, aware that it's an issue
17:09:27 <strcat[m]> we've slowly started restricting what can be done with those to mitigate the issue
17:09:36 <strcat[m]> i.e. disabling system apps, removing permissions / access from them, etc.
17:10:54 <strcat[m]> so, before claiming it's broken, consider what you might have broken yourself
17:12:01 <ananteris[m]> which should be literally nothing, fresh install, never paired ADB, disabled sensors in some preinstalled (non system) apps and that's it
17:12:53 <strcat[m]> > disabled sensors in some preinstalled (non system)
17:12:56 <strcat[m]> non-system?
17:13:02 <ananteris[m]> It does seem that slowly but surely everything except for browser stopped working, it does still work though. I guess it not being instantly disabled is another issue
17:13:20 <strcat[m]> should always be instant
17:13:24 <ananteris[m]> Ehh sensors disabled for contacts and the like
17:14:13 <strcat[m]> there are 2 people who have experienced the issue now
17:14:21 <strcat[m]> and both were disabling permissions for system apps before it occurred
17:15:02 <strcat[m]> it's possible there's an issue but then it's pretty strange it has only happened for very few people and it has not been possible to replicate
17:15:26 <strcat[m]> also nothing special about how it applies to Vanadium
17:16:06 <strcat[m]> ananteris: which device are you on
17:19:11 <ananteris[m]> Pixel 4XL
17:20:47 <ananteris[m]> Resetting app perms didn't fix for tor browser specifically, or google translate afaict
17:21:51 <ananteris[m]> I'll have another device to audit with at some point but don't have one on hand 🤷‍♂️
17:23:19 <strcat[m]> have you rebooted? it sounds quite strange
17:23:36 <strcat[m]> the internet permission does work in a somewhat special way via netd
17:25:02 <strcat[m]> same way it works on stock OS
17:26:23 <ananteris[m]> I did, I had too, resetting them broke openvpn
17:26:39 <strcat[m]> resetting what?
17:26:46 <ananteris[m]> App perms
17:26:54 <ananteris[m]> On owner and secondary user
17:28:14 <strcat[m]> can you please describe the setup and what exactly isn't working
17:28:17 <strcat[m]> reboot first
17:28:19 <strcat[m]> then describe it
17:28:55 <strcat[m]> the feature works properly in the general case, and works for most people, so there is something strange about your case
17:29:08 <strcat[m]> ananteris: were you using 'end session'?
17:32:07 <ananteris[m]> Okey donkey, fully updated GODS, rebooted.. Owner profile has always on VPN enabled (openvpn for android), second profile has always on VPN enabled as well (openvpn for android).. Have network/sensors disabled for Tor browser.... Yet it still works
17:32:25 <ananteris[m]> * Okey dokey, fully updated GODS, rebooted.. Owner profile has always on VPN enabled (openvpn for android), second profile has always on VPN enabled as well (openvpn for android).. Have network/sensors disabled for Tor browser.... Yet it still works
17:32:38 <ananteris[m]> * Okey dokey, fully updated GOS, rebooted.. Owner profile has always on VPN enabled (openvpn for android), second profile has always on VPN enabled as well (openvpn for android).. Have network/sensors disabled for Tor browser.... Yet it still works
17:33:03 <strcat[m]> Sensors access works or just network access?
17:33:09 <ananteris[m]> * Okey dokey, fully updated GOS, rebooted.. Owner profile has always on VPN enabled (openvpn for android), second profile has always on VPN enabled as well (openvpn for android).. Have network/sensors disabled for Tor browser in second profile.... Yet it still works
17:33:17 <strcat[m]> network access on modern devices is enforced by netd same as on the stock OS
17:33:21 <strcat[m]> it's more dynamic than it used to be
17:33:25 <strcat[m]> used to be based on uids
17:33:35 <strcat[m]> there's a service that listens for permission changes and informs netd that it changed
17:33:40 <strcat[m]> ananteris: have you rebooted, first of all?
17:33:44 <ananteris[m]> For tor browser both are disabled
17:33:55 <ananteris[m]> I did
17:34:14 <ananteris[m]> Rebooted after wiping app perms on owner and second profile
17:34:26 <ananteris[m]> And a second time to be sure
17:34:37 <strcat[m]> and if you toggle it again, that doesn't work?
17:36:20 <ananteris[m]> Yeah, toggling network for TB on in my second profile it still works, off it still works
17:36:29 <ananteris[m]> It always works
17:36:51 <strcat[m]> and does toggling other permissions work>?
17:36:54 <strcat[m]>  * and does toggling other permissions work?
17:37:16 <ananteris[m]> I guess I can try with location
17:37:17 <strcat[m]> ananteris: were you using end session? I asked earlier
17:37:35 <strcat[m]> end session has some serious upstream bugs
17:37:58 <strcat[m]> ananteris: it sounds like the app's state is somehow corrupted and it's hard for me to remotely debug that
17:38:04 <dazinism> Wonder if its anything to do with having always-on VPN set it two profiles
17:38:10 <strcat[m]> reinstalling the app would resolve it but I need to know how it happened
17:38:24 <strcat[m]> ananteris: do not think anything about Network toggle is broken
17:38:30 <strcat[m]> there are other bugs in AOSP though
17:39:14 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base.git/+/master/services/core/java/com/android/server/connectivity/PermissionMonitor.java
17:39:16 <strcat[m]> this is the relevant code
17:39:32 <strcat[m]> that's where we add support for dynamically toggling Network, but it doesn't sound like the issue is with dynamic toggling
17:39:34 <strcat[m]> sounds like it's not working at all
17:41:10 <strcat[m]> so, I don't think that's the issue
17:41:16 <dazinism> Isn't there some strange stuff about how android handles the VPN when a VPN is switched on in multiple profiles and people switch between them?
17:41:19 <strcat[m]> and Sensors / Network have a similar implementation
17:41:22 <strcat[m]> if that was the issue Sensors should be broken too
17:42:00 <strcat[m]> ananteris: it would be helpful to get logs and see if anything goes wrong but it's unclear what's happening in the first place
17:42:12 <dazinism> Guess its somewhat unlikely VPN functionality weirdness would effect Network permission though
17:42:13 <strcat[m]> it sounds like the app's state is corrupted but somehow resetting it doesn't fix it
17:42:22 <strcat[m]> dazinism: not really unlikely
17:42:30 <strcat[m]> it's implemented in netd
17:42:36 <strcat[m]> and involves the permission monitor code
17:43:03 <strcat[m]> I just don't see what could be wrong with this to cause that kind of issue and it's strange that it's some extremely rare issue which has impacted only a couple people
17:43:16 <strcat[m]> both of whom were using secondary profile where it broke and toggling system app stuff
17:44:43 <dazinism> Having read the logs its not clear to me that either was toggling system app permissions? but maybe I missed it.
17:46:02 <strcat[m]> it appears to be a profile issue
17:46:06 <strcat[m]> not an issue with the permission per se
17:46:07 <TheLoneWanderer4> After reading the chat I'm experiencing the same issue
17:46:47 <strcat[m]> I think it's a secondary profile issue
17:46:52 <strcat[m]> triggered by an upstream bug
17:46:54 <strcat[m]> I'll work on it
17:47:18 <strcat[m]> toggle off the permission in the main profile for the app
17:48:05 <strcat[m]> netd doesn't handle the secondary user properly
17:48:06 <strcat[m]> afaict
17:48:59 <strcat[m]> anyway I'll work on it
17:49:01 <tempname1> Sorry to interrupt the conversation, I just wanted to say I've been using Graphene OS for about a week now and I'm loving everything about it. Really great work, keep it up! :)
17:49:08 <strcat[m]> one of the recent AOSP security updates probably broke it
17:51:08 <ananteris[m]> It looks like for other apps location correctly will re-ask with the popup UI if it has been disabled.. Couldn't get TB specifically to even ask
17:51:42 <strcat[m]> ananteris: try installing it in Owner profile and disable Network there
17:51:47 <strcat[m]> I think it's an AOSP netd bug, we'll work on it
17:52:03 <strcat[m]> keep in mind all we do is add the toggle, it's functionality that's already in AOSP other than that
17:53:17 <ananteris[m]> Alright
17:54:41 <strcat[m]> AOSP user profiles have a fair bit of issues right now we need to resolve
17:54:51 <strcat[m]> we fixed the VPN issue and then got it fixed upstream
17:56:36 <ananteris[m]> strcat: boom.there.it.is
17:56:37 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "AOSP user profiles have a fair b"> Like?
17:56:45 <strcat[m]> end session race
17:56:47 <ananteris[m]> Has to be disabled in owner profile
17:57:03 <strcat[m]> ananteris: yeah, we'll fix it
17:57:14 <strcat[m]> regression tied to something with Android 11
17:57:23 <ananteris[m]> Ty sir
17:57:37 <ananteris[m]> <3 gos btw
18:18:23 <strcat[m]> ananteris: we're aware of an AOSP bug that causes issues like this (ran into it previously) and may be causing this problem
18:18:32 <strcat[m]> looking into the cause
18:18:42 <strcat[m]> it's a regression in AOSP that happened at some point, this isn't the only issue
18:27:46 <strcat[m]> not yet
18:27:46 <strcat[m]> need to figure out more about it 1st
18:34:25 <ananteris[m]> If you have a ticket system I'm more than happy to file a general ticket
19:07:33 <ItsPronouncedTOR> Hello
19:14:48 <entry1> <ItsPronouncedTOR "Hello"> What's up
19:15:19 <ItsPronouncedTOR> Well, the Earth is constantly rotating, and for all we know, we are 'upside down' in the universe, simply held to the Earth by Gravity
19:15:33 <ItsPronouncedTOR> So Up for Earth humans is always changing as the Earth rotates
19:15:58 <ItsPronouncedTOR> Up simply means above though
19:16:05 <ItsPronouncedTOR> so whats Up, is the atmosphere
19:16:07 <ItsPronouncedTOR> :)
19:17:02 <entry1> hilarious
19:17:46 <ItsPronouncedTOR> I am actually in cyrogenic sleep
19:18:45 <panoramics[m]> Quick question im hoping to get some help with: lets say I wanted a second profile for banking that needed microG to run. If I install microG on that profile, will the main profile be untouched by this? Does this work or is it nonsense?
19:19:19 <ItsPronouncedTOR> Just use the web browser to access online jew slavery banking system
19:19:49 <entry1> strcat  or mods ^
19:20:02 <ItsPronouncedTOR> *puts on new mask*
19:20:11 <ItsPronouncedTOR> its true
19:20:13 <ItsPronouncedTOR> Why do you defend the Jew?
19:20:27 <panoramics[m]> My bank requires me to either use a push tan or I have to carry a tan generating device.
19:20:45 <panoramics[m]> Would love to avoid the second option
19:20:49 <ItsPronouncedTOR> tan?
19:20:59 <ItsPronouncedTOR> temporary authentication number?
19:21:06 <panoramics[m]> Yeah
19:21:11 <panoramics[m]> In order to verify its me
19:21:19 <panoramics[m]> Kind of a 2FA
19:21:23 <ItsPronouncedTOR> yes
19:24:40 <panoramics[m]> So I guess my question is: is micro g installed system wide or is it like an app, contained within the profile
19:25:37 <darkestcabbage[m> How can I backup my data to restore it following the ROM's flashing
19:25:39 <darkestcabbage[m> ?
19:26:54 <nahman[m]> Installing micro g will unbuckle the security model GrapheneOS is trying to build
19:27:01 <nahman[m]> It's not supported
19:27:23 <nahman[m]> No one will advise you to use micro g here
19:28:01 <panoramics[m]> I get it. Was just hoping that profiles were a way to get around that
19:28:43 <nahman[m]> If you can use a hardware token do that. That way you are not limited to one device
19:29:33 <panoramics[m]> Makes sense
19:31:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> What's a hardware token ?
19:34:35 <troypatrick[m]> Look up yubikeys
19:37:04 <panoramics[m]> <nahman[m] "No one will advise you to use mi"> Still wondering though, is it a purist approach which is totally valid or does it really break something systemwide. In that sense, my question still stands: profiles are not good here in that case, is that what is being said?
19:39:02 <strcat[m]> the issue isn't that you can't install it
19:39:04 <strcat[m]> you can install it
19:39:15 <strcat[m]> but it isn't granted special capabilities or the ability to trick apps into thinking it's Play services
19:39:18 <strcat[m]> it mostly won't work
19:39:31 <strcat[m]> simply by being present / enabled apps will try to use Google services
19:43:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> I've got a yubikey but I've just seen this convo now so wondered what you meant
19:46:32 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "simply by being present / enable"> This is totally true. You can take that crappy tik tok as example. It crashes with microg and works fine without it because it tries to utilize firebase UI thinking play services are present on the device.
19:46:40 <panoramics[m]> <strcat[m] "it mostly won't work"> I think there was a list somewhere where you could look up what works and what doesn't. But yeah, I get it
19:47:36 <vdge[m]> per profile microg implementation will be the best whenever implemented. Hopefully soon.
19:47:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ㅤ> I run dummy tiktok, insta and Snapchat all in a separate user.  No prob

19:49:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ㅤ> Yeah
19:49:19 <vdge[m]> Yes, they work fine without microg. Snapchat(Checks for safety net if play services are present) & tiktok won't work with it.

21:01:13 <partman8989[m]> Hello everyone -  I recently installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 5, and it worked flawlessly.   I then tried to re-flash the stock Android image onto the phone, but I forgot to remove the GrapheneOS verified boot keys.  So when I flashed the Android image with fastboot, the phone went to reboot, and never powered on again.   I cannot get it to power on again.   How screwed am I?
21:03:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <partman8989[m] "Hello everyone -  I recently ins"> If it didn't power on, that's a hardware issue
21:03:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> As far as I know you can wipe the phone and it should work
21:04:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Don't do that yet though, wait for someone to corroborate it
21:07:49 <dazinism> partman8989: can you get back into fastboot?
21:08:51 <partman8989[m]> No,  the phone doesn't seem to power on at all,  so when I plug it into the computer, it doesn't even see it as a USB device
21:11:45 <dazinism> partman8989: could it of run out of power? Maybe plug it into a charger?
21:12:18 <partman8989[m]> definitely not,   it was near 100%, and i've plugged it in and left it for hours just to be sure.
21:13:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Don't worry, you're not screwed
21:13:13 <dazinism> Guess you tried holding power and volume down (and maybe up?)
21:13:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can sell it, don't need to mention the damage
21:13:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> :P
21:13:51 <partman8989[m]> Yes.   tried to hold power and volume all combinations,  for minutes at a time.  I even brought the phone to a ubreakifix  and they were not able to get it turned on.   Although i didn't tell them that I was messing with the bootloader
21:14:01 <strcat[m]> partman8989: not removing GrapheneOS verified boot key doesn't break flashing stock
21:14:08 <strcat[m]> it just still trusts the verified boot key for GrapheneOS too
21:14:58 <partman8989[m]> So  what you're saying is that  not removing the GrapheneOS verified boot key   can't cause  this issue i'm seeing with the phone not powering on?
21:16:11 <kracklepop[m]> <partman8989[m] "Yes.   tried to hold power and v"> Oof, RIP 😔
21:18:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <partman8989[m] "So  what you're saying is that  "> Well you'll still have to flash GrapheneOS, but yes
21:19:37 <noax8[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!ㅤ> Yes"> Thanks
21:19:58 <strcat[m]> partman8989: it can't cause that
21:20:06 <strcat[m]> having the GrapheneOS key flashed means GrapheneOS key is still trusted
21:20:06 <strcat[m]> that's it
21:20:11 <strcat[m]> it is not why your phone is not booting
21:20:20 <strcat[m]> and it's only an extra trusted key for the OS
21:21:14 <partman8989[m]> Ok,  but just to be clear,   it had the GrapheneOS key, but the stock Google Android bootloader was flashed onto it  right before the phone shut off
21:21:56 <strcat[m]> has nothing to do with the GrapheneOS verified boot key
21:22:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Konrad (@d​vd_rw) has joined the Telegram Group!
21:22:08 <strcat[m]> sounds like you somehow flashed the wrong thing or it somehow broke the device
21:22:16 <strcat[m]> it's not related to the GrapheneOS key
21:22:22 <strcat[m]> you can happily flash stock OS without removing the key
21:22:25 <strcat[m]> removing it is OPTIONAL
21:23:55 <partman8989[m]> oh, i see.    Okay sounds like my device is hard bricked then.   Thank you for the clarification
21:24:42 <strcat[m]> partman8989: maybe it is, maybe it isn't
21:24:49 <strcat[m]> but that key isn't relevant and wouldn't have stopped flashing stock
21:25:04 <strcat[m]> we just explain how to remove it for completeness so people can fully return the device to stock state
21:25:14 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't trust our verified boot key anymore
21:25:22 <strcat[m]> the yellow boot state is only available if there's a key flashed to secure element like that
21:25:27 <strcat[m]> if there isn't, it's not available
21:25:40 <strcat[m]> but it's still possible to have green boot state with the key flashed, doesn't break ti
21:25:44 <strcat[m]>  * but it's still possible to have green boot state with the key flashed, doesn't break it
21:26:18 <partman8989[m]> That makes sense.   Thanks!
21:28:16 <onyxrubber> so... will it be repaird?
21:28:39 <onyxrubber> I mean.. I have problem on pixel 4a 5g. While i taking screenshot, and try to edit, the screenshot is very blurry
21:31:12 <GhostSplinterSix> <onyxrubber "I mean.. I have problem on pixel"> Even after you're done editing it?
21:31:53 <onyxrubber> after editing, the screenshot is clear
21:32:09 <onyxrubber> ...and sharp enough
21:32:29 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. That's how it normally goes.
21:35:21 <onyxrubber> GhostSplinterSix on my previous phone there was no this effect
21:38:10 <strcat[m]> ananteris: confirmed that granting / revoking permission works fine for both Network and Sensors in secondary user and right uid, etc. is passed
21:38:13 <strcat[m]> ananteris: so it's an AOSP bug
21:38:15 <strcat[m]> need to investigate more
21:38:34 <strcat[m]> Sensors works fine in secondary users
21:38:41 <strcat[m]> the flaw is the netd management code in AOSP
21:38:46 <strcat[m]> unclear what exactly atm
21:38:51 <strcat[m]> the way INTERNET is implemented got changed
21:43:27 <GhostSplinterSix> I wish I was as intelligent as you, strcat.
21:44:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!nahman> Nah dude. Stive to be better. Envy is worthless.
21:59:54 <strcat[m]> ananteris: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/73444c4cbdcfaaf499d23e12ea61c79dd151666b
21:59:56 <strcat[m]> think it's fixed
21:59:57 <strcat[m]> AOSP bug
22:00:08 <strcat[m]> will do a release with it tomorrow
22:00:25 <strcat[m]> older devices use gid-based permission instead of netd
22:07:09 <strcat[m]> still needs to be tested
22:07:10 <strcat[m]> may not fix it
22:07:10 <strcat[m]> think I might just be misunderstanding that flag
22:07:10 <strcat[m]> but anyway the problem is in this code somehow
22:09:47 <strcat[m]> yeah that's not it
22:10:29 <strcat[m]> I see the issue though
22:42:53 <entry1> No big deal as it looks like a small period of time and can't access anything. When switching profiles, does anyone get a view of the home screen of the locked profile (in my case the owner profile when I leave a secondary profile) they are switching to? It's happened to me a few times and you could see any apps installed on the homepage without logging in. I'm on the 3a and its not like it is a risk as no real information
22:42:53 <entry1> is exposed, just curious. I'm running GrapheneOS on the Pixel 3a
22:43:44 <entry1> Its essentially stuck on the lock screen and I have all my profiles password/passcode locked

22:46:53 <strcat[m]> it's a known upstream bug they've acknowledged as a minor security issue and are fixing if you mean with end session
22:49:50 <entry1> Thank you for the information!! strcat
