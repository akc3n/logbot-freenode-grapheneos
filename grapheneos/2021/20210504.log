00:05:07 <sklv1> anyone can confirm whether this https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/164674874492 or any other USBC to 3.5mm adapter will work with pixel4a / grapheneOS?
00:06:00 <sklv1> I know it has a 3.5mm jack, but in my experience, when running/cycling, the female 3.5mm socket contacts get worn down, resulting in intermittent sound, so I'd like to use a USB-C adapter if possible
00:14:00 <sklv1> i see it needs to include a DAC based on reading the github issue. I will try this: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/174149704314
00:19:02 <strcat[m]> only digital USB-C audio accessories will work
00:19:07 <strcat[m]> not analog one that expect analog USB-C audio support
00:19:12 <strcat[m]>  * not analog ones that expect analog USB-C audio support
00:19:19 <strcat[m]> ideally analog USB-C audio would not exist....
01:07:49 <CryptoAnonym1> All traditional voice calls analyize the speakers voice print, a unique pattern on their voice.
01:07:50 <CryptoAnonym1> Therefore, voice alone can be fingerprinted just as accuratly as a fingerprint.
01:07:50 <CryptoAnonym1> Therefore, we must obfuscate/mask our voice using a System-Level Voice Changer to change the pitch, and tone, with multiple passes. Example, one pass layers over the voice, raising pitch, another layer lowers pitch to a different level.p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; }
01:08:19 <CryptoAnonym1> Using Signal for all calls is ideal, best case, but isn't always possible, say when calling a Utility company
01:08:29 <CryptoAnonym1> Therefore, an integrated voice changer would mask our voice print
01:08:33 <CryptoAnonym1> And keep our voice anonym
01:08:41 <CryptoAnonym1> Please add a system level voice changer
01:08:45 <CryptoAnonym1> I just donated $2 XMR btw
01:10:05 <strcat[m]> 2 XMR or $2 worth of XMR
01:10:16 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> There's no escrow in sending money in GrapheneOS, iirc. It's always treated as donation
01:10:40 <CryptoAnonym1> $2 worth of XMR
01:10:57 <CryptoAnonym1> Voice Print Analysis occours Globally by NSA
01:11:04 <CryptoAnonym1> Masking the voice print is an important ability
01:11:14 <CryptoAnonym1> A simple Audio-FX filter layer over our raw voice
01:11:19 <CryptoAnonym1> to allow pitch modulation
01:11:22 <CryptoAnonym1> would be sufficient
01:11:32 <CryptoAnonym1> =)
01:12:01 <strcat[m]> we're not adding stuff like that, said many times before
01:49:04 <strcat[m]> lots of nice changes for the new release
01:50:29 <Math[m]1> <strcat[m] "lots of nice changes for the new"> When is it out? :o
01:50:34 <Math[m]1> I want to try it!
01:54:54 <certificategos[m> Hi, I'm trying to import a CA certificate with Setttings --> Wifi --> Wifi preferences -->Advanced --> Install certificates without much success. My CA certificate is a xxxx.cer. When I click "install certificate", I can click on the certificate I want to import and then to give it a name. And then... Nothing. The screen become grey until I go back with the arrow (bottom left of the screen). I first tried with a
01:54:54 <certificategos[m> secondary profile, then with the owner profile. No success. What I am missing? Thanks!!
02:00:13 <strcat[m]> certificategos: maybe it's not valid? don't know
02:01:18 <Math[m]1> Welcome, f3lliot!
02:01:49 <certificategos[m> got it from mitm.it (mitmproxy) for my tests.  The pem certificated went all right into the iphone I have to test
02:06:21 <certificategos[m> Do the installation of the CA certificates must be done with the owner profile? Or any profile is ok?
02:10:40 <strcat[m]> try owner, unsure if that has per-profile configuration
02:10:51 <strcat[m]> some things that could in theory be configurable per-profile are not
02:10:57 <strcat[m]> fairly likely that's one of them
02:12:50 <certificategos[m> OK, I'll try to regenerate one and see if I have better luck. Thanks for your help!
02:19:26 <GrassFedBooks79> 1000 people in Graphene IRC :O
02:22:32 <GrassFedBooks79> I wish I had mined bitcoin in 2009
02:22:37 <GrassFedBooks79> And I'd donate $100,000 to Graphene
02:23:54 <rny[m]> if you mined in 2009, you'd be donating more than 100K
02:23:55 <rny[m]> :P
02:25:58 <GrassFedBooks79> true
02:26:02 <GrassFedBooks79> I almost mined btc
02:26:06 <GrassFedBooks79> I just had to download the software
02:26:18 <GrassFedBooks79> It was the day bitcoin released, I considered mining it
02:26:24 <GrassFedBooks79> If I had mined BTC, id be a billionare
02:26:30 <GrassFedBooks79> I could donate $1 bill to gos
02:26:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Can't do much about that now
02:27:06 <rny[m]> its ok, when a friend told me about it in 2011, i thought it was a fkin scam.
02:27:28 <GrassFedBooks79> yeah I kow I just keep reliving that day
02:27:40 <GrassFedBooks79> I could of mined $2 million worth of btc per day
02:27:42 <GrassFedBooks79> Just by leaving my pc on
02:27:59 <rny[m]> it kinda was, it was explained to me in the context of needing to use mtgox and mtgox sounded really sus. to me.
02:28:01 <GrassFedBooks79> Now Im considering becoming a Truck driver to make $900 per week maybe
02:28:07 <GrassFedBooks79> It was sus
02:28:09 <rny[m]> alas, funds was lost
02:28:11 <GrassFedBooks79> Its just a cryptocoin though
02:28:18 <GrassFedBooks79> I bought 1 BTC back in 2012
02:28:21 <GrassFedBooks79> When 1 BTC = $100
02:28:27 <rny[m]> yea, but that wasnt communicated really clearly through the friend.
02:28:42 <rny[m]> it was sort of along the lines "oh there's this magical token you can buy from mtgox"
02:29:25 <GrassFedBooks79> Andyeah
02:29:35 <GrassFedBooks79> it would of been 5 minutes to earn 1 billion
02:30:27 <GrassFedBooks79> 1. Download BTC Wallet. set password and encrypt wallet file. 2. Download BTC miner and input address, click start mining. 3. Wait 3 years until CPU mining becomes impracticle due to scaled difficulty. 4. Wait 8-10 years. 5. Pay 50% in taxes and cash out, buy private island and bunker, etc.
02:30:41 <GrassFedBooks79> the interesting thing is
02:30:49 <GrassFedBooks79> Theres really nothing unique about bitcoin compared to any other coin
02:30:53 <GrassFedBooks79> Its just digital information
02:31:05 <GrassFedBooks79> Monero is just as valuable as bitcoin
02:31:08 <GrassFedBooks79> practically
02:31:17 <GrassFedBooks79> its the value people perceive that makes bitcoin valuable
02:33:43 <rny[m]> ok i think thats enough talk on cryptocurrencies
02:33:49 <rny[m]> it is offtopic in #grapheneos
02:33:54 <GrassFedBooks79> alright
02:45:38 <GrassFedLobster> Hi
02:45:43 <GrassFedLobster> I think the 'attacks' on Graphene
02:45:47 <GrassFedLobster> are 99% drama
02:55:56 <amsterdam2> I think the best idea is to just ignore or block the calyx hoes.
02:56:03 <amsterdam2> no need to waste money on them

04:47:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hi guys. I'm just going to set +m for a bit so I can concentrate, for a little bit.
05:28:37 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Iphone question.  Is apps that uses the secure enclave still protected when the phone is unlocked?
05:28:37 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Like if an app says that it stores the credentials in the secure enclave and uses an separate code from the lock screen code, is it then protected or does the lock screen code give access to everything stored in the enclave?
05:45:15 <akc3n[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org seeing as how this is #GrapheneOS on android and not iPhone. Your question is perhaps better suited for the offtopic room.
05:46:07 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Sorry my bad. Was meant for the off topic
06:52:36 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.05.04.01 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.05.04.01

07:29:32 <MrSenshi[m]> Wonderful release, should we expect the OTA to be out and available already?
07:33:17 <strcat> no
07:33:27 <strcat> in testing channel, then when that's done beta channel
07:33:33 <strcat> for at least 12 hours
07:35:47 <MrSenshi[m]> Makes sense. Looking forward to this one, backups for secondary users and changes to the wallpaper system were very needed.
07:36:18 <MrSenshi[m]> As for "integrate modern Android theme and wallpaper configuration."
07:36:18 <MrSenshi[m]> Does that mean we will be able to set accent colours?
07:41:15 <strcat[m]> yes
09:04:55 <helloworldkk87[m> Not getting the update but maybe it will arrive soon
09:16:39 <somenerd[m]> it's in the testing channel apparently
09:16:41 <somenerd[m]> > in testing channel, then when that's done beta channel
09:26:57 <helloworldkk87[m> Oh right
10:24:18 <graphen> How much risk I will be going through if I use Firefox as my daily browser?
10:24:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> how do you measure this? Xd
10:25:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> just read this https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
10:26:06 <graphen> Already read that
10:26:10 <graphen> that's why I'm asking
10:26:44 <johntheripper[m]> <graphen "How much risk I will be going th"> depends on your threat model
10:27:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can't really say "oh i'm 10 times more secure on chromium then on firefox"
10:27:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> because you can't really measure security
10:27:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so your question makes no sense :P
10:33:29 <alex-resist> Firefox' engine is particularly lacking on mobile, so you shouldn't use it. Sole exception is Tor Browser, which has unique privacy features, but is unfortunately not very secure even with heightened security settings
10:37:49 <alex-resist> I wonder how many people are using Orbot + Vanadium and whether there are any striking downsides to that combination
10:41:19 <alex-resist> In other news, looking forward to beta test 2021.05.04.01 and give feedback before it ends up in stable, for once
10:42:00 <alex-resist> It should be out today, right?
10:59:41 <helloworldkk87[m> <alex-resist "I wonder how many people are usi"> Should not be combined at least according to Jolly Roger
11:04:51 <alex-resist> But why?
11:06:42 <helloworldkk87[m> Will make you stand out
11:07:07 <dazinism> Guess the number of people using vanadium with orbot is pretty low.
11:07:17 <helloworldkk87[m> Yeah
11:08:11 <sklv1> in my experience madaidan is very bias, makes numerous uncited claims and literally suggests using Windows
11:08:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <sklv1 "in my experience madaidan is ver"> No, he's not and stop attacking him
11:09:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> He cites all his claims
11:09:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just because you don't like some of them doesn't make him false
11:15:18 <sklv1> I never said his claims are false. I won't be drawn into further discussion as it's likely offtopic, but a concrete example of an uncited claim is "VPNs will only ever give a security benefit when you're browsing a site lacking HTTPS which is rare." - for a start it is based on the false assumption that browsing sites are the only thing that people do over a VPN.
11:15:49 <dazinism> alex-resist: yeah think beta will be out soon. See the room logs 4 hours ago
11:15:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> sklv1: well VPNs don't really give any security benefit
11:16:21 <alex-resist> security, privacy and anonymity are different things
11:16:47 <sklv1> anupritaisno1[m]: do you not think that's a highly subjective claim? does it not depend on who you do and don't trust?
11:18:17 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: (112KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/gwqDAWjMdKoAvmgxibMWlZPf/IMG_20210504_164805_674.jpg >
11:18:19 <sklv1> If I have an ISP I don't trust, that mines DNS queries for data that's then used against me, and a VPN prevents that happening, is it really as simple as saying "VPNs don't really give any security benefit". I think not

11:18:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some credits to TheJollyRoger and strcat for this information
11:19:56 <sklv1> "why do you think your VPN provider's network is more secure than your isp's" - because it's based in a different country, and in a different legal jurisdiction with different consequences.
11:21:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <sklv1 ""why do you think your VPN provi"> Legal jurisdictions don't care about computer network design
11:21:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I did not know making laws made code more secure
11:22:22 <sklv1> Well, as an example, the US government can compel $US_COMPANY to turn over my traffic, but can't compel $RUSSIAN_COMPANY to do the same.
11:23:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <sklv1 "Well, as an example, the US gove"> I mean you'd probably already be in trouble at that point
11:23:59 <sklv1> As another example, the UK has a DNS query based register of what sites people access, and when. All kinds of agencies have access to this data including healthcare providers for example. Using a VPN goes some way to mitigating this concrete security threat.
11:25:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> <sklv1 "As another example, the UK has a"> I don't see any security threat here
11:26:05 <flawedworld[m]> thats not a security issue, thats a privacy issue
11:26:36 <sklv1> IMHO while they are different concepts, they're not mutually exclusive, as in that case.
11:27:11 <flawedworld[m]> and a VPN doesnt really solve the snooper laws in the uk either, as they log traffic by bandwidth use
11:27:19 <flawedworld[m]>  * and a VPN doesnt really solve the snooper laws in the uk either, as they log traffic by bandwidth use additionally
12:15:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Don has joined the Telegram Group!
12:18:48 <alex-resist> dazinism shouldn't Orbot + Vanadium look identical to Orbot + Chrome on stock? That should increase the anomymity set quite a bit
12:19:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Vanadium does not look like stock Chrome
12:20:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> *vanadium does not look like stock Chrome mobile
12:20:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> AFAIK (from my own experience), it looks more like desktop/mobile chromium on Linux to the websites you're visiting
12:21:56 <dazinism> alex-resist: yeah, unfortunately, due to the hardening, its possible for sites to 'fingerprint' it as being vanadium. They can also see the device model
12:21:59 <alex-resist> I thought one of the goals of the Vanadium project was to not stand out from the stock browser
12:22:06 <alex-resist> Hmm ok
12:22:15 <dazinism> As much as possible it is
12:22:51 <helloworldkk87[m> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> Vanadium does not look l"> It does but if a website does enough digging they can spot that you are on GrapheneOS Vanadium
12:23:50 <Pratyush[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "It does but if a website does en"> can you provider a explanation for this claim ?
12:23:58 <Pratyush[m]> > <@helloworldkk87:matrix.org> It does but if a website does enough digging they can spot that you are on GrapheneOS Vanadium
12:23:58 <Pratyush[m]>  * can you provide a explanation for this claim ?
12:25:06 <helloworldkk87[m> "It's worth noting that the Vanadium canvas / WebGL / audio fingerprints match 100% with Chrome on the stock OS for the same device family (based on SoC). "
12:25:06 <helloworldkk87[m> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/ciizae/vanadium_and_bromium_privacy/
12:26:00 <flawedworld[m]> floc is disabled, do not track is enabled, no drm enabled - that alone makes you stand out a little bit more from just plain old chrome as those arent the defaults
12:26:09 <alex-resist> I guess Tor Browser still has an advantage there
12:27:39 <alex-resist> Perhaps the only real solution is to use the web as little as possible
12:27:40 <Pratyush[m]> <flawedworld[m] "floc is disabled, do not track i"> yes but brave, ungoogled chromium and other browser do the same, yes it's not 100% match with chrome (stock chrome).
12:28:24 <helloworldkk87[m> Even if a website detects you are on GrapheneOS Vanadium you would still blend in with the rest of Vanadium users
12:28:43 <sklv1> I can't imagine it's a very high number
12:28:58 <alex-resist> Even on Graphene not all people use Vanadium
12:29:01 <helloworldkk87[m> Well true xd
12:29:41 <flawedworld[m]> things like this are why Safari on iPhone is great when it comes to not sticking out
12:30:02 <alex-resist> I guess it also depends on the threat model. The recommendation is probably different for a person worried about local observers (ISP, carrier, police) than the websites identifying individual users
12:30:05 <sklv1> and if you happen to dislike ads, your only option is to go home
12:30:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> here is an explanation to my claim, when i logged-in my google account thru Vanadium, in the log-in history it showed up as a "Chrome on Desktop Linux"
12:31:31 <Pratyush[m]> User agent might be a reason
12:31:55 <Pratyush[m]> https://medium.com/naver-fe-platform/prepare-for-client-hints-freezing-user-agent-9c0ea1ddd02c
12:32:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah maybe, idk
12:36:18 <alex-resist> Ok, so the best for non-Tor, non-VPN anonymity would be to just install Signal, leave everything else as it is, and then use public WiFis with MAC randomization? :P
12:40:30 <dazinism> alex-resist: guess it depends who you want to be anonymous to. If on the local end, may want to change all the connections to Graphene servers
12:40:41 <dazinism> captive portal, network time checks and turn off OS update checks?
12:41:22 <alex-resist> True, although my suggestion was to remain in the anonymity set of all Graphene users
12:41:47 <alex-resist> There's probably a three digit number of users in my city
12:44:06 <alex-resist> It's surprisingly difficult to stay really anonymous, even with all the advanced technology that is available these days
13:07:48 <sklv1> most technologies cater to users who don't care about anonymity, as that's where their profits opportunities are. the resources invested in deanonymising technologies far outstrip the resources invested in anonymising technologies.
15:10:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <sklv1 "I never said his claims are fals"> You're implying that his claims are ridiculous
15:11:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Most people use VPNs for browsing
15:12:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And anyway you should stop being pedantic
15:20:17 <minodesign> hallo dev
15:20:42 <minodesign> I am checking an old Nexus 5
15:21:00 <minodesign> ...there was once a version of Graphene OS for it?
15:21:48 <minodesign> Actually I have Android 6 on it
15:24:24 <flawedworld[m]> <minodesign "...there was once a version of G"> Historically under the former sponsor (Copperhead). It has not been supported since the end of 2016? something like that
15:24:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yes, but it's already EoL
15:28:24 <minodesign> oh no. If it's called Copperhead no
15:28:44 <minodesign> '=D  I will use the stock ROM so
15:29:25 <flawedworld[m]> We wouldn't recommend the device on the whole to be quite honest, it no longer gets security updates. https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705
15:35:03 <minodesign> yes it's for a retro review
15:35:16 <minodesign> but it makes more sense t ouse the stock. Thanks!
15:36:11 <flawedworld[m]> no worries, some of the former source code from that era can be found here: https://github.com/AndroidHardeningArchive if you wish to reference it. The former changelogs can also be found here: https://grapheneos.org/history/legacy-changelog
15:41:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Btw while I agree that vpns are not a perfect solution (probably a perfect solution will never exist), and I agree that it's annoying when script kiddies think that just enabling a vpn makes them instantly 100% anonymous and untraceable, and while we should remember them that this not how it works and that there are downsides to using vpns too, won't you agree that there are at least a bunch of respectable vpns 
15:45:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Sorry for the essay, I would also love to hear what you guys think of a configuration like this:me --> vpn1 --> TOR network --> vpn2 --> facebook
15:45:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Why not Tor Browser -> facebook ?
15:45:44 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Don't
15:45:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> This way my ISP/government would not see I'm using tor, and the website I'm trying to reach would also not be able that I use tor
15:46:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Why not just facebook ?
15:46:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Some governments are starting to target tor users. Also many websites have troubles with tor nodes, and don't allow them to connect to the website
15:46:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> True
15:46:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> .
15:46:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<TheOnlyRealJonathan> This way m"> VPNs can't hide that fact well
15:47:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> At most, you can avoid your ISP being like CRIMINAL
15:47:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not really though. Traffic analysis is a thing
15:47:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> It was an example. Let's say I'm a journalist in a targeted countrym
15:47:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The NSA will find out easily
15:47:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> You have to login on facebook, at this point they don't care about your ip
15:47:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> I see
15:47:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Not really though. Traffic analy"> I know I'm saying VPNs cannot hide that fact for anything more than basic detection

15:48:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But once they see the metadata, you're done
15:48:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> I would sag Whonix is your best bet
15:48:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> I do agree with you, just replying on hiding Tor traffic
15:48:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "I do agree with you, just replyi"> Yes
15:48:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Which is impossible
15:48:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Yes, but I don't want the government to see I use tor, I prefer it to see I'm using a bpn
15:49:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> And my vpn only knows I'm connecting to tor
15:49:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<TheOnlyRealJonathan> Yes, but I"> You'll never be able to prevent it
15:49:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> And after tor the vpn provider number 2, only see connection coming from tor
15:49:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And that's ignoring gov forcing VPN to log your Tor traffic
15:49:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> No no no
15:49:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Tor already routs your connection through multiple IPs
15:49:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Clap clap
15:50:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You don't need to add a VPN
15:50:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It doesn't help
15:50:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> I don't want the website I'm reaching or my gov to know that I'm using tor
15:50:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Adding a VPN at the beginning COULD prevent IP based tor detecion
15:50:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Izumi Sena (@I​zumiSenaSora) has joined the Telegram Group!
15:50:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> The only solution I know of is using a proxy or vpn before, and after tor
15:50:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But it's easy to see metadata
15:50:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Better if the vpn provider before and after are 2 different vpn providers
15:50:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> VPNs do not hide that metadata
15:51:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And anyone watching can figure out Tor from metadata
15:51:26 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<TheOnlyRealJonathan> Better if "> NO NO NO
15:51:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Listen to what I am saying
15:51:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And adding a VPN after Tor completely ruined it
15:52:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They know who is connecting, and IP address is just one way of seeing that
15:52:53 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You had to log in
15:52:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And what's the benefit anyway?
15:53:06 <helloworldkk87[m> This sounds like a thing where human errors will occur very easily... I would just keep it simple and use Whonix or Tails and not bother with this stuff
15:53:22 <Railgun_Lover[m]> helloworldkk87: whonix, tails, or Tor
15:53:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Browser
15:53:35 <helloworldkk87[m> Yeah keep it simple
15:54:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I never understood why people want VPN with tir
15:54:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Until gov starts breaking doors of tor users
15:54:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Specifically, VPN after Tor
15:54:29 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<TheOnlyRealJonathan> Until gov "> Again, read what I said
15:54:32 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I'm not repeating it
15:54:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> I read, and I used whonix and tails 5-6 years ago already
15:54:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And you should be upfront with Tor usage anyway, you're doing nothing wrong
15:54:58 <EV-9600[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "And what's the benefit anyway?"> Many sites block Tor, sometimes Tor+VPN is your only optiob
15:55:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> There are hidden bridgea for that
15:55:08 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <EV-9600[m] "Many sites block Tor, sometimes "> Then just use VPN
15:55:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Hidden bridge is a good addition to my proposed configuration
15:55:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> you're unnecessarily slowing your connection and ruining anonymity
15:55:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> me --> vpn1 --> TOR network --> vpn2 --> facebook
15:56:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> You're right in part, I think the main downside is slow connection of course, but I think this is much better than tor alone
15:56:41 <EV-9600[m]> The best way to achive this is by buying several VPSs from providers like bitlaunch from different accounts, then tunneling through a different one for every new Tor route
15:56:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> I am aware of the possible consequences of using vpn over tor and stuff like that, I read the tor docs, but in this case, using it before and after, I think would be actually better
15:57:39 <EV-9600[m]> This is quite pricy, will require you to set up your own VPN and some sites also block VPN/VPS traffic so won't even always work
15:58:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I don't see how this topic is GrapheneOS related, therefore please move to off-topic room
16:00:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Please read the rules of the room, as this is getting close to the violation of rule 2 D.
16:17:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> True dat
16:35:17 <Forbo[m]> I have some questions regarding the System Update UX. Is that a Graphene specific thing, or is that something that was inherited from AOSP?
16:35:38 <Forbo[m]> If it's the latter, I'll likely move discussion to off-topic.
16:42:02 <strcat[m]> it's a GrapheneOS developed app
16:42:07 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't have one
16:48:43 <Forbo[m]> Cool cool. Wondering if mine is working correctly, as when I manually tap the "Check for updates", there's not really any UI feedback that it is actively checking for an update. I get the highlight on the menu item showing that I tapped it, but then there's no indication that an update check is happening or has happened. I searched on here and read on https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates but couldn't find anything
16:48:43 <Forbo[m]> pertaining to that. I suppose I should also have searched GitHub to see if there was an issue related to this, I suppose I'll do it now.
16:51:19 <Forbo[m]> Ah, searching GitHub comes up with these, so it looks like it's already been brought up. Sorry to bother!
16:51:19 <Forbo[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/issues/19
16:51:19 <Forbo[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/issues/23
16:51:52 <Forbo[m]> Hopefully by talking about it, this will now show up in chat history when someone searches for it.
17:02:33 <helloriasgremory> Is there any plans on getting the google camera app working in graphene?   Got the pixel 5 but can't use the wide angle camera  without the google camera app.
17:03:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can try this: https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
17:03:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's not officially supported nor recommended
17:11:04 <janjaap[m]> <helloriasgremory "Is there any plans on getting th"> I use the app with success on my 3a. It only works when microg is installed.
17:14:30 <withinfire[m]> Apologies, first time attempt at installing GrapheneOS, likely a stupid question (couldn't find it in the log), but how long does the process take? And how big are the factory images?
17:16:21 <helloworldkk87[m> About 1gt and if everything goes well (with Web-Installer) it takes about 10 minutes max
17:16:40 <withinfire[m]> > About 1gt and if everything goes well (with Web-Installer) it takes about 10 minutes max
17:16:40 <withinfire[m]> thank you!

17:29:37 <withinfire[m]> annoying, for some reason this brand new Pixel 4a 5G seems stuck on the February security patch. It seems to keep trying to install a new security update (of various sizes) but doesn't appear to succeed.. would have thought it would download everything in one go? guess I'll finish this first
17:33:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is that stock?
17:33:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> try rebooting
17:33:49 <nscnt[m]> withinfire: It's all incremental on stock OS
17:34:30 <withinfire[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> is that stock?"> yeah
17:34:42 <withinfire[m]> <nscnt[m] "withinfire: It's all incremental"> oh... i'll shut my silly mouth then. thank you!
21:45:45 <loadsas[m]> @luddi:matrix.org: Did you solve this problem? Because I have the same issue.
21:46:54 <strcat[m]> what issue?
21:47:01 <loadsas[m]> I talk about the spotify connect/zeroconf stuff
21:50:07 <loadsas[m]> Spotify doesn't find devices which don't use any credentials e.g. librespot

22:13:33 <strcat[m]> are you importing it into the owner profile?
22:13:42 <certificategos[m> yes
22:23:55 <certificategos[m> And I have confirmation that the certificate I used yesterday was not bogus. I did the test with an Iphone and I was able to install it.
23:00:27 <certificategos[m> OK, so the certificate coming from the procedure here above cannot be activated on the iphone. I guess an extension is missing.
23:01:07 <certificategos[m> Summary: The certificated delivered by mitmproxy can be installed in an Iphone but cannot be install in my GOS

23:08:38 <m4g3nt4[m]> The beta release 🥳
23:10:08 * certificategos[m posted a file: (1KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/COFKFRbpmOIVGQdYdkwDWqag/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer >
23:10:44 <certificategos[m> Here is the certificate delivered automatically by mitmproxy if somebody wants to try to reproduce
23:11:40 <certificategos[m> openssl x509 -in mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer --text
23:11:40 <certificategos[m> ... if you want to see its content before installing
23:12:51 <certificategos[m> This certificate gets correctly installed on an Iphone but not on GOS here
23:15:23 <certificategos[m> But maybe it is a lot to ask to install a CA certificate on one's phone in such a security oriented group!? :-))
23:16:32 <certificategos[m> Just to try to reproduce the problem, though! Please remove it just afterwards. Just to test if  one "GOS phone" can install a certificate
23:17:16 <certificategos[m> Settings-->Network & internet-->Wifi-->Wifi preferences-->advanced-->install certificates
23:25:15 <gqz5> hello
23:25:34 <Dylanger[m]> <certificategos[m "mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer"> Lol
23:26:00 <certificategos[m> why lol?
23:26:41 <gqz5> What are the current reports of police trying to read out a locked screen grapheneos phone with a long password?
23:27:14 <gqz5> the main profile was running and the screen was locked.
23:37:48 <strcat[m]> recommend reading the documentation
23:38:25 <certificategos[m> Did I miss something about the certificates installation??
23:43:22 <gqz5> strcat[m]. the different profile-functionality was not used. The phone was at AFU state when it was taken by police.
23:46:49 <strcat[m]> okay? as I said, recommend reading the documentation to understand what the project is about and what it does
23:52:07 <gqz5> i know https://grapheneos.org/features and https://grapheneos.org/usage . I would like to know if there was any reported success in unlocking a GrapheneOS Phone in AFU state.
23:53:30 <strcat[m]> so, you're asking for random anonymous people here to make stuff up?
23:53:34 <TheJollyRoger> gqz5: Currently not to our knowledge; an exploit capable of bypassing the lock screen, according to Zerodium, would be worth up to $100,000 USD as of last month.
23:53:36 <strcat[m]> is it trolling?
23:53:51 <strcat[m]> you won't find a better resource than the documentation on the site including the FAQ
23:54:21 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: that's not about GrapheneOS
23:54:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir, sorry about that.
