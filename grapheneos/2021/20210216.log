00:18:35 <demonmachina[m]> PSA: I've been flashing GOS for a hot minute on used phones. Just did it for the first time on a brand new device through TMobile (US). It took a few days, but if bought in cash, and a quick call to customer service, all is well.
00:18:35 <demonmachina[m]> They will carrier unlock immediately, but it takes ~96 hours to unlock the bootloader.
00:19:43 <demonmachina[m]> FWIW, called google as well to inquire as to why I couldn't unlock immediately...neither TMobile nor Google gave an answer.
00:33:37 <demonmachina[m]> [TheJollyRoger](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org) can you post a link to your testbench, please?
00:36:46 <Jaywest44> I've had a pixel for 2 months waiting for a release for it. Anyone try it and know how it works?
00:36:50 <Jaywest44> pixel 5
00:41:43 <akc3n[m]> <Jaywest44 "pixel 5"> Its status is experimental - https://grapheneos.org/releases
00:45:18 <Jaywest44> i read experimental but I its a bit unclear how experimental. I am not a developer but looking forward to using grapheneos
00:50:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hello demonmachina[m], I don't actually have a link to my test bench anymore, but I can briefly describe to you how I made it.
00:50:55 <TheJollyRoger> I do have some documentation about setting up for CTS though, let me go and retrieve it.
00:52:20 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Testers/The-Compatibility-Test-Suite.md This is it.
00:52:36 <serpantsauce[m]> <Jaywest44 "i read experimental but I its a "> You can use it, it just might not be as stable as say a Pixel 4a. From what I've heard most people don't have issues with it though.
00:53:36 <TheJollyRoger> Jaywest44: it might have the occasional bug or breakage. The developers are looking for people to test it, use it as normal (browse the internet, make calls, run and install apps) and see if stuff in it that wasn't broken before has become broken before they mark it as "stable."
00:55:48 <TheJollyRoger> demonmachina[m]: Aside from your computer and a generously long USB cable, you'll need a large desk lamp, and something at least a foot (ideally, two feet) away on either side of the phone that both the front and the rear cameras can focus on. The cover art of a book tends to work alright. If you have a mitten drying rack or a bookend, you can use that to hold the phone on its side so both the
00:55:50 <TheJollyRoger> front and rear cameras can see in opposite directions. If the phone is lying flat face up, or lying flat face down, it won't work.
00:56:35 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure that it's somewhere where that phone will not be disturbed, and can remain undisturbed for long periods of time, because some of the tests can run for a very long time.
00:56:49 <TheJollyRoger> You'll also want to get the test suite for Android 11, as needed.
02:36:09 <^Spyda^> hi guys, I'm looking for some troubleshooting advice, specifically how to lock bootlocker - after installed Graphene, it is stuck on (greyed out). Thanks in advanced :)
02:43:03 <brenneke[m]> <serpantsauce[m] "Also does anyone here use SIP nu"> Sipnetic
02:43:24 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: I think you may have missed a step.
02:43:57 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: can you do me a quick favour, and return to fastboot? Power the phone off, then press and hold down Volume Down and Power together until fastboot comes up.
02:44:21 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me if you see something that looks like "Bootloader: Locked" or "Bootloader: Unlocked"
02:44:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw
02:45:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wrong chat, sorry
02:45:04 <TheJollyRoger> Either that or if your phone boots and you see an orange screen like "Software Inegrity not guaranteed" then your bootloader is not locked and you've missed a step.
02:45:13 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: heh, I do that all the time.
02:45:27 <TheJollyRoger> *Software integrity not guaranteed"
02:45:57 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: if indeed you see either unlocked, or that orange screen, return to https://grapheneos.org/install/web and see the section on locking the bootloader.
02:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> You must lock the bootloader from the fastboot screen.

03:00:56 <XiloPhone1> Graphene OS is Awesome! Donate Thousands of MONEROJ to Graphene OS!!
03:02:05 <^Spyda^> ThJollyranger: I used 'fastboot flashing lock' command in terminal and it just said "waiting for devices"  and yet when I run  "adb devices", it gives me my device's number (it recognises its there)

03:03:58 <XiloPhone1> Â *Flexes in AI*
03:04:11 <XiloPhone1> YOur welcome *zooms off to Elon musk space-sphere*
03:05:29 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: The phone will have to be in Fastboot for any fastboot commands to work.
03:05:43 <StVM[m]> <^Spyda^ "ThJollyranger: I used 'fastboot "> Maybe because you have adb running so fastboot cant connect to your phone. I am not to sure better wait for more expert.
03:07:52 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: if you already are in fastboot mode when you're running those commands, there are a few possibilities:
03:08:43 <^Spyda^> Im all ears!! :) Thanks for taking the time to think this through with me, really appreciate it - even if we can't solve it but *fihgers crossed*
03:08:45 <^Spyda^> :)
03:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> A) The first possibility: you're missing the driver. If you're on Windows, plug your phone in while it's on Fastboot, and then check your optional updates in Windows updates, or for an Android Bootloader device in Device Manager.
03:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> Microsoft package the driver themselves, no third-party downloads are necessary.
03:12:25 <TheJollyRoger> The second possibility: your USB cable, or your computer's USB port, or your computer's USB slot doesn't actually have the necessary traces/wiring or firmware support for issuing Android Bootloader debugging commands; it's important to note that not all USB devices are created equal. The sign that this could be the case generally tends to be if fastboot enumerates the devices and often can lock
03:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> or unlock them, but flashing hangs.
03:12:45 <TheJollyRoger> So we'll start with possibility A first and try and get you that driver.
03:13:18 <^Spyda^> Im using OSX
03:13:55 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, got it, can you reboot your phone to the bootloader, and then see if fastboot will enumerate the device while the device is booted into the bootloader for me?
03:14:03 <^Spyda^> I think the cable is fine, its a new belkin cable which I purchased as part the same thought process as you just raised
03:14:20 <TheJollyRoger> Better yet, you can use the Web Flasher at https://grapheneos.org/install/web
03:14:22 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
03:15:13 <TheJollyRoger> But the handset will need to be in fastboot for this. It won't work if not, because the fastboot program, or fastboot.js talks only to fastboot on your phone.
03:15:45 <TheJollyRoger> Once the operating system is running, you're no longer in the bootloader so fastboot won't "see" your phone because it's no longer in the bootloader.
03:15:47 <^Spyda^> yeah its in fastboot mode
03:16:06 <^Spyda^> boot loader ver 25-0.3-6835615
03:16:17 <^Spyda^> Device state: unlocked
03:16:19 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Do you see something about "locked" or "unlocked?"
03:16:39 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, the install isn't finished then. Alright, so, quick question...
03:16:43 <^Spyda^> and there is Recovery Mode, Bar mode, restart boot loader and rescue mode
03:16:58 <^Spyda^> ahh ok
03:17:06 <TheJollyRoger> Inbetween the time you flashed, and now, did you store anything on that phone? Any pictures, 2FA token seeds, apps that you don't want to lose?
03:17:32 <^Spyda^> zero
03:17:51 <^Spyda^> I was just finishing up what I thought was a successful installed, when I noticed that the boot loader lock was greyed out
03:17:53 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Ok, you're all set. Plug your phone in and on the web flasher, there should be a button to lock the bootloader after installation.
03:18:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Locking the bootloader is the last step to the installation.
03:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's a small, but *crucial* piece of the installation.
03:18:14 <^Spyda^> So i tried to trawl the web for answer before giving up to IRC :)
03:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> Well, you've come to the right place!
03:18:28 <TheJollyRoger> So, I'll briefly explain why this is:
03:19:01 <^Spyda^> What mode should i Select for loading it up this time? Recovery mode, Safe mode, etc?
03:19:26 <TheJollyRoger> Each instance of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical across every single device type that runs it and can be remotely attested to. If you have a 4a, it doesn't matter if you live anywhere else, my device running a 4a will be identical to it right down to the last 0 and 1.
03:19:32 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, just plug it in, and set the phone down on your desk.
03:19:40 <TheJollyRoger> *plug it into your computer, and set the phone down on your desk.
03:19:50 <TheJollyRoger> The computer's going to handle the next step.
03:20:49 <TheJollyRoger> When it's locked, the bootloader will ensure that the keys work, and the image is verified. locking the bootloader is important for the security features on your phone to operate, without the bootloader being locked, GrapheneOS is considered "incomplete."
03:21:20 <TheJollyRoger> So, once your phone's plugged in and showing fastboot, click on the "Lock Bootloader" button.
03:21:20 <goblinslayer[m]> when can I expect the 3a to be labelled as 'outdated' no longer supported; is there any estimate on it?
03:21:27 <^Spyda^> So i should tun the phone on and log in?
03:21:58 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: no, do exactly what I said, leave it on fastboot, plug it in while it's on fastboot, and visit https://grapheneos.org/install/web#locking-the-bootloader
03:22:08 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: click on "lock bootloader"
03:22:25 <^Spyda^> no worries
03:22:41 <StVM[m]> <goblinslayer[m] "when can I expect the 3a to be l"> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cnexus-devices%2Cpixel-phones
03:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> This will only work if you're in that fastboot screen, with "unlocked" showing. If you go start doing onther things or start the phone, it isn't going to work.
03:23:13 <TheJollyRoger> goblinslayer[m]: there is: Look at the month that the phone was first released on the Google Store, then count three years.
03:23:21 <^Spyda^> It says 'error no device selected'
03:23:34 <^Spyda^> And i am in the fastboot mode screen on phones startup
03:23:48 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: ok, do you have fastboot the commandline app still pathed and ready?
03:24:19 <TheJollyRoger> Can you tell me if it returns anything if you enter the command
03:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot devices
03:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> ?
03:24:44 <^Spyda^> yes but it always says 'waiting for devices'
03:25:10 <^Spyda^> Which seems like its also not communicating properly, however it is detected by doing the add devices command
03:25:49 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: no, I asked for the command "fastboot devices" - if it's not detecting a phone it should produce an empty line.
03:26:15 <TheJollyRoger> Can you copy and paste the command output (zero out your device's serial number) so I can see it, please?
03:27:03 <TheJollyRoger> goblinslayer[m]: If I recall correctly, the 3a and 3aXL were both released on May of 2019. So unless I'm mistaken, this means those devices will be EOL at the end of May 2022.
03:27:12 <^Spyda^> Sure thing doing it now
03:27:30 <^Spyda^> 'e$ fastboot devices
03:27:30 <^Spyda^> 0B231JEC205752	fastboot'
03:27:48 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: ok, now let me know if it does the same thing when you do "fastboot flashing lock"
03:28:01 <TheJollyRoger> Since it's enumerated the device successfully.
03:28:40 <TheJollyRoger> Look at your phone once you've hit return.
03:29:02 <^Spyda^> fastboot flashing lock
03:29:02 <^Spyda^>                                                    OKAY [  0.153s]
03:29:02 <^Spyda^> Finished. Total time: 0.154s
03:29:06 <goblinslayer[m]> <TheJollyRoger "goblinslayer: If I recall correc"> thanks for your answer, I might look into buying a more high end model to have longer support when I get the financial means to do so
03:29:16 <^Spyda^> Looks like it worked
03:29:19 <TheJollyRoger> goblinslayer[m]: You're welcome!
03:29:30 <^Spyda^> Coz it says 'if you lock the boot loader, you will not be able to install customer operating system software n this phone'
03:29:49 <goblinslayer[m]> fun thing is not that usually the latest model get's more expensive for some reason when a new one releases
03:29:57 <goblinslayer[m]> at least where I am from
03:30:02 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: yep! Now the important test... can you unplug your phone for me, and on Fastboot, can you select "start" and confirm with the power key?
03:30:16 <TheJollyRoger> Wait for a moment, and can you confirm that orange screen has now changed to a yellow one with "Your device is loading a different operating system?"
03:30:47 <TheJollyRoger> You can skip it by rapidly tapping and letting go of the power key twice in rapid succession, but can you confirm you see it?
03:31:01 <^Spyda^> The only option that comes up is 'Lock the boot loader' or 'do not lock the bootloader'
03:31:09 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: select "Lock the bootloader"
03:31:16 <TheJollyRoger> And use the power key to confirm.
03:31:32 <TheJollyRoger> Then give it a few seconds. Eventually it'll return you to the bootloader.
03:31:36 <^Spyda^> Now its loading saying locked
03:31:54 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: can you confirm you see the yellow "Your device is loading a different operating system?"
03:32:30 <^Spyda^> Its just back to the fostboot mode screen
03:32:35 <TheJollyRoger> goblinslayer[m]: Yeah, the high price of phones is a hard one to swallow.
03:32:40 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: ok, can you hit start now?
03:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> Use the volume up/down keys to change options.
03:33:00 <^Spyda^> now its saying the 'Your device is loading a different operating system'
03:33:01 <TheJollyRoger> Once you see start, tap power once and immediately let go.
03:33:09 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: Welcome to GrapheneOS. The installation's finished.
03:33:13 <^Spyda^> oh and as i was typing that off the screen, it started to boot up by itself
03:33:22 <^Spyda^> now its at the grapheneOS load screen
03:33:34 <^Spyda^> Dude
03:33:37 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: there are now two remaining steps you can take, which are both optional BUT are recommended.
03:33:38 <^Spyda^> You're a life saver
03:33:51 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: Yarr harr, that be what I be here for, shipmate!
03:33:53 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship!
03:34:22 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: the first thing you're going to want to do, once you get past the welcome tutorial, is to go back into developer options, and switch "OEM Unlocking" back to "off."
03:34:23 <^Spyda^> Yeah man, I'm so stoked to be off apple :)) Im about to start buying these phones to sell to all of my mates at cost price, to try and get as many ppl as I know onto graphene. :))))
03:34:43 <TheJollyRoger> Then disable Developer options and don't use them unless you're going to be developing/debugging or sending in a crashreport.
03:34:45 <^Spyda^> Im about to do my second one now, so thanks!!! You've def added at least me and my fam to graphene fam :))
03:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: Yarr-harr, splice the mainbrace!
03:35:11 <take_a_deep_brea> ^Spyda^:  welcome to the community ! we generally recommend iOS to people who dont want to get their hands dirty on setting up graphene or have app compatibility issues!
03:35:29 <TheJollyRoger> The other optional step to do is to pair with auditor at https://attestation.app for integrity self-monitoring. Again, this is optional and it's up to you if you do or don't want to do it.
03:35:53 <TheJollyRoger> However, since you have two devices, you could use them to verify each other, using the second one to verify the install with AUditor by downloading it from Google Play.
03:36:07 <TheJollyRoger> Then once you know that the first one is good, flash the other, then use the first one to verify the second.
03:36:17 <^Spyda^> Man
03:36:33 <^Spyda^> I'd LOVE to do that.. I was going to take the lazy option but if you suggest I do it then I will
03:36:33 <somenerd[m]> yeah it's a cool feature
03:36:39 <^Spyda^> Plus, im sure its a great thing to learn.
03:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, I'll walk you through it. Can you get the other phone out and switch it on?
03:37:11 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to go to get Auditor off Google Play, that's the safest place to get it from *unless* you already have it.
03:37:24 <^Spyda^> Its still a virgin google phone though, just in case you weren't clear on that. But yes, ill get it now
03:37:25 <TheJollyRoger> *unless you have a known good previous version
03:37:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! That's exactly what I need.
03:37:53 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to use the Google OS to start the process.
03:38:06 <TheJollyRoger> Since it already has Play Store on it.
03:39:05 <TheJollyRoger> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.attestation.auditor&hl=en_US&gl=US This is it.
03:39:32 <^Spyda^> Cool, ill just finish the first phone, then all go there.
03:39:41 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
03:39:57 <^Spyda^> is it safe to use biometric stuff do you think?
03:40:04 <TheJollyRoger> The other alternative is to use the attestation server, but doing a local pairing is awesome, because that way you can see the results with no middle man.
03:40:05 <^Spyda^> I typically avoid all of that stuff but...
03:40:16 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: Perfectly.
03:40:18 <^Spyda^> Yeah, lets do the local one!! :)
03:41:00 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, I prefer biometrics identification to unlock my phone because what if I need to open my phone it on the bus? Or worse, on a subway train full of cameras looking down on me from about three different angles?
03:41:10 <TheJollyRoger> *to open my phone on the bus?
03:41:33 <TheJollyRoger> Or you know, about three different people looking over my shoulder?
03:41:41 <somenerd[m]> > The other alternative is to use the attestation server, but doing a local pairing is awesome, because that way you can see the results with no middle man.
03:41:41 <somenerd[m]> both is cool lol imo
03:41:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha, yeah it's fun to do both.
03:41:51 <somenerd[m]>  * > The other alternative is to use the attestation server, but doing a local pairing is awesome, because that way you can see the results with no middle man.
03:41:51 <somenerd[m]> both are cool imo
03:42:02 <somenerd[m]> since 1 is for the first verification on if it
03:42:09 <somenerd[m]>  * since 1 is for the first verification on if it's GrapheneOS or not
03:42:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:42:44 <somenerd[m]> and the other one is for automated verification
03:43:34 <somenerd[m]> so that you can tell when it's compromised (GrapheneOS) and reboot accordingly
03:43:53 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: you'll also want to make sure you un-pair your Google phone from Play Services before you start the process of installing Graphene. Otherwise you won't be able to factory reset or unlock.
03:44:27 <somenerd[m]> didn't they finish installing?
03:44:30 <somenerd[m]> or is this lag
03:44:49 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: They've got two phones, we're going to use the stock phone to verify the one they just installed.
03:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> Then once we know that one's good, flash the second one, and use the first one to verify the second.
03:45:15 <TheJollyRoger> So this way the workflow is:
03:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> A) Stock Google OS verifies GrapheneOS via remote attestation
03:45:51 <TheJollyRoger> B) Google OS phone is wiped, then GrapheneOS is installed to it.
03:46:02 <TheJollyRoger> C) Existing verified GrapheneOS phone verifies fresh install.
03:46:06 <somenerd[m]> Flash 1st > Verify 1st with 2nd > Flash 2nd > Verify 2nd with 1st (in terms of phones)
03:46:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
03:46:13 <somenerd[m]> right?
03:46:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you got it!
03:47:55 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just going to get myself a snack, so I'll be back in a bit...
03:51:55 <^Spyda^> good point regarding the biometrics - i'd never thought about the real possibility for bad actors to spy on you using cameras on public infrastructure
03:52:07 <^Spyda^> I was always so worried about apple stealing it and using it for their evil deeds
03:52:34 <^Spyda^> with the google play auditor program; dumb question but download on my handset or on my PC?
03:52:52 <somenerd[m]> handset
03:53:54 <^Spyda^> Cheers somenerd :) Im powering the new one up now!
03:53:54 <take_a_deep_brea> ^Spyda^: its just an android app
03:54:11 <take_a_deep_brea> great!
03:55:05 * TheJollyRoger returns with a sandwich that stands about a foot tall
03:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> There we go.
03:55:14 <^Spyda^> awesome. Ill brb too, back in appx 20 - my dogs been very patient throughout this process as its eaten into his usual ball throwing time
03:55:24 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Go get 'em.
03:55:26 <^Spyda^> Food rechargeeee :)
03:55:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, of course!
03:55:33 <^Spyda^> Good time to do it while phone charger :)
03:56:40 <TheJollyRoger> A recharge for the phone, and a recharge for humans!
04:40:59 <^Spyda^> a'igghhtt! Im back again, new phone at setup screen - il wait to hear from you :)
04:47:37 <njha> the way https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/94 is written makes it sound like grapheneos will have its own package repository format
04:47:56 <njha> did I interpret that correctly? Or would the F-Droid repository format be acceptable with a different client
04:47:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hey ^Spyda^, go through the process of obtaining Auditor, the way you normally would.
04:48:43 <njha> I'm thinking about starting an implementation for this- finally annoyed enough at manual updates :)
04:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> njha: it's likely we'll continue using .apk format for apps. It's a good design, we just won't be doing it using F-Droid.
04:49:09 <^Spyda^> Doing that now :)
04:49:16 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: great!
04:50:51 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: so there is one extra step before installing GrapheneOS on the second phone: that's that if you log into Google on your second phone, before you install GrapheneOS on it, you may need to un-set the account from the phone after you're done, before you try to unlock it. That can be done via the Accounts page in the Settings dialog.
04:50:58 <njha> TheJollyRoger: Well yeah, .apk format for apps. I meant the F-Droid repository format: /index.xml, etc.
04:51:08 <take_a_deep_brea> njha:  i suggest you follow DanielMicay on twitter as he has frequently discussed the project in there
04:51:11 <TheJollyRoger> njha: ohhhh, sorry about that, yeah, I misunderstood.
04:52:11 <njha> I've been piecing through information from danielmicay on twitter/reddit but it's very fragmented and difficult to find :(
04:52:32 <take_a_deep_brea> true
04:52:34 <njha> I'll take another look though, thanks
04:52:36 <take_a_deep_brea> but its worth it
04:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... I gotta figure out if there's a way I could download all the tweets together, and then maybe try to organize them into some easily searchable format.
05:00:16 <^Spyda^> A'right, affirmative regarding the de-selecting account before I flash, and auditor app running
05:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: okay, great! Ok, so, put both phones on the desk in front of you and switch both of them on.
05:02:16 <TheJollyRoger> So, on the one running the stock OS, tap "Auditor, Device performing verification"
05:02:23 <TheJollyRoger> It should pop you up a QR code.
05:02:36 <TheJollyRoger> Now I want you to go to the GrapheneOS phone, and tap "Auditee, Device being verified."
05:02:54 <TheJollyRoger> It will ask you for a permissions prompt to use the camera when you do this, it's perfectly OK to grant it permission to use the camera.
05:03:10 <TheJollyRoger> What's going to happen is that the auditing device is going to issue a challenge to the other phone via QR code.
05:03:36 <TheJollyRoger> The other phone is going to need to scan it, and it's going to generate attestation data from the attestation keys contained in its security chip.
05:04:37 <^Spyda^> Got it, ill try to do it now
05:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> The initial pairing is going to be trust-on-first-use, but the good news is, it's not alone: the attestation key will be validated by the hardware key in the phone, which has been pre-validated all the way back to a self-signed certificate belonging to Google to certify that this is indeed a proper Android device, by a known vendor, which has been okayed by Google itself.
05:05:43 <TheJollyRoger> Once the auditee has scanned the challenge code, tap on the auditor's QR code using your finger, and it will prompt you to scan a (much larger and more complex) QR code on the auditee.
05:05:46 <TheJollyRoger> Now --
05:05:51 <TheJollyRoger> is your phone a 4a5G, or a 5?
05:05:59 <TheJollyRoger> I forgot, I should've asked this before we started.
05:06:05 <TheJollyRoger> *are either of your phones a
05:08:41 <TheJollyRoger> After the keys are established the first time, from that point, the auditor will remember the phone it audited until you instruct it to "clear auditor pairings" at which point the data is deleted.
05:09:16 <TheJollyRoger> So that way even if someone tried to change the keys on you, Auditor would realize "Hey hold it! Something's not right!"
05:09:29 <^Spyda^> ok i think I've completed that it now reads (on the google auditee) phone 'Successfully performed basic initial certification and pairy
05:09:34 <TheJollyRoger> Perfect!
05:09:53 <^Spyda^> Wow, this is so hectic. This tech is mind blowing haha
05:10:01 <TheJollyRoger> So what that phone is telling you...
05:10:14 <^Spyda^> and also im using Pixel4a (4g)
05:10:24 <TheJollyRoger> "I've just recieved a key for the first time from this phone, but it's a legitimate image of either GrapheneOS *or* the Stock Pixel OS."
05:10:32 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Okay, whew.
05:10:43 <^Spyda^> it says  stock unmodified official release
05:10:47 <^Spyda^> OS ver 1.1.0.0
05:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a5G and the 5 are supported, but they need an update for that, because the update was only published yesterday.
05:11:09 <TheJollyRoger> So that's why I had to ask first :P.
05:11:21 <^Spyda^> Yeah I noticed that when I was doing my research, hence i decided to stick with the hardware that supported a more stable version
05:11:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:12:06 <TheJollyRoger> If you repeat the exact process you did previously, you will notice now the screen will turn green.
05:12:24 <TheJollyRoger> this will indicate "I have verified this phone before, and I know its keys, it looks good."
05:16:03 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor can do some very amazing things: if something changes your system partition while it's online it can detect that.
05:16:04 <^Spyda^> it just did the same thing again
05:16:07 <TheJollyRoger> Because then the signatures won't match.
05:16:10 <^Spyda^> and then I did something else and i said mismatch
05:16:18 <^Spyda^> then i did it again and it went back to the yellow screen
05:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Which phone were you trying to verify?
05:16:38 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Did you clear the attestation pairings?
05:16:45 <^Spyda^> Yeah I did actually
05:16:47 <^Spyda^> Whoops
05:16:50 <^Spyda^> Forgot to add that
05:17:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, yeah, if you clear them, the phones won't know each other anymore.
05:18:24 <TheJollyRoger> So... note one important thing:
05:18:43 <TheJollyRoger> Each challenge, and each response to it, uses a unique cryptographic value.
05:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> So it's impossible to save the response, and use it a second time. If the process is interrupted, you'll need to start over because each challenge, and the correct response to it is unique.
05:19:28 <^Spyda^> Interesting ok cool
05:20:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. This is to prevent a "replay" attack.
05:21:34 <^Spyda^> Nice ok got it
05:21:45 <^Spyda^> Now the green screen has arrived
05:21:53 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo!
05:22:19 <^Spyda^> !!! :))
05:22:23 <TheJollyRoger> So now, we know that that phone you've just verified with GrapheneOS, it's legitimate, that's a legitimate system image that's signed, validated and authenticated.
05:23:34 <TheJollyRoger> So what you can do now that we know that phone is good, is to wipe that Google phone (if you logged into an account wit hit, you'll need to remove the account, before the reset), and you can install GrapheneOS to it the same way.
05:23:50 <TheJollyRoger> Then you can use the known good GrapheneOS phone to audit the other one the same way, once the installation is finished and completed, and the bootloader is locked.
05:24:06 <^Spyda^> NICEEEE!
05:24:12 <^Spyda^> Thats fkn awesome
05:24:16 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome to GrapheneOS :D
05:24:19 <^Spyda^> Man, thanks so so sSOO much
05:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
05:24:36 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship, ^Spyda^!
05:24:48 <^Spyda^> Thanks man! Im really glad to be aboard
05:25:14 <^Spyda^> Rob Brax got me onto this and The Hated One - both good youtube channels for ppl wanting to learn this stuff imo ;)
05:25:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! Hey, and if you find GrapheneOS useful, please send Daniel Micay a donation, at https://grapheneos.org/donate - we're kept sailing by donations, since we don't associate with a business or something along those lines, that keeps this voyage going!
05:25:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hey right on, lots of people coming in from YouTube.
05:26:32 <TheJollyRoger> For future reference, just in case...
05:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> Just in case you need to repeat this process, but you don't have a second phone handy,
05:26:43 <^Spyda^> lol iw as just duck ducking that now
05:26:43 <thetranstocommie> <^Spyda^ "Rob Brax got me onto this and Th"> I'm gonna be 100% honest with you, I'd stay away from brax. its awesome you're getting into digital privacy, but he specifically isn't super great.
05:26:50 <^Spyda^> Does he take crypto, was my question :)
05:27:12 <TheJollyRoger> He does! He takes Bitcoin, and Monero!
05:27:35 <^Spyda^> Oh man, he has BTC. What a legend.
05:27:52 <grapheneos_user_> <^Spyda^ "Does he take crypto, was my ques"> Might not want to give crypto at the moment. Its great in the long term but it will crash soon in the short term.
05:27:54 <TheJollyRoger> If you need to repeat the process, but you're in the unfortunate position where you don't have one more phone to do it with, GrapheneOS maintains a remote attestation server at https://attestation.app . There, the attestation server runs pairing and integrity monitoring.
05:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> What's really neat about Attestation Server is that it can be set up to do recurring E-mail alerts.
05:28:35 <^Spyda^> Man, I need to buy some XLM, it pumped so hard the other day and I bet it will in the future too + the ideology behind it is obviously very appealing
05:28:54 <TheJollyRoger> You basically set a "Check in with my phone every X hours" and "If my phone fails to check in after Y hours, warn me."
05:30:08 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone will need to have data/wifi to answer the challenge.
05:30:39 <TheJollyRoger> I recommend if you do self-monitoring, to use an E-mail address that is not accessible from the device that you are monitoring.
05:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor checks for intrusion/system image compromise, so if say, your phone actually did get compromised, and something modified your system image, if your E-mail is accessible from the same device you are auditing, a compromised device could simply choose to hide the notification dot and erase the E-mail from your inbox before you can reach it.
05:34:22 <TheJollyRoger> In the future, Attestation Server might be made more easily self-hosted or support multiple attestation servers, but for now, GrapheneOS hosts its own, in-house.
05:34:44 <TheJollyRoger> Very, very handy feature.
05:34:55 <somenerd[m]> > In the future, Attestation Server might be made more easily self-hosted or support multiple attestation servers, but for now, GrapheneOS hosts its own, in-house.
05:34:55 <somenerd[m]> you can self host
05:37:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's possible, but you'll also need to change some stuff.
05:58:38 <^Spyda^> Ok donation made!! I did a solid trade last night so Dan can have it :)) Woohoo. Hope he keeps it up
06:00:08 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: Woohoo! Thank you so much man, on behalf of the project, we really appreciate the help.
06:00:11 <^Spyda^> Wow that super interesting !!!
06:00:16 <^Spyda^> Re attestation
06:00:17 <^Spyda^> Amazing
06:00:40 <^Spyda^> My pleasure and thanks for the awesome support!!!! You are definitely the reason why I doubled my donation :)
06:00:51 <^Spyda^> Love great customer support :)
06:00:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! Remote Attestation I think was originally done for securing payments and such for things like Google Pay and possibly for other things like secure logon in the future... but Auditor repurposed it for intrusion detection.
06:01:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, that's what I'm here for :)
06:01:16 <somenerd[m]> it's quite cool (remote attestation) imo
06:01:18 <somenerd[m]> really like it
06:01:30 <somenerd[m]> especially the compromise detection
06:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> In the future if I ever write a smartphone app, I want to use Remote Attestation for logging into your account without needing a password.
06:01:56 <strcat[m]> Auditor also strictly uses hardware-based attestation and also uses pinning of the certificate chains + hardware-backed key
06:02:06 <strcat[m]> so it's much different than weak software-based attestation which can inherently be bypassed
06:02:34 <^Spyda^> Amazing
06:02:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, good to see you, captain. I gotta head off the computer for a bit though X(
06:02:42 <^Spyda^> I actually order some yubikeys the other day
06:02:47 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet is software-based attestation with opportunistic usage of hardware-based attestation without any pinning, so if hardware-based attestation is unavailable it still passes as software verified
06:02:56 <strcat[m]> Auditor is a much different thing
06:05:02 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, so that's what that is...
06:06:59 <^Spyda^> Interesting info strcat!!!
06:07:01 <^Spyda^> Thanks!!!
06:07:10 <^Spyda^> Jolly, have a good break mate! peace :)
06:09:05 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks! Fare thee well~
06:41:46 <^Spyda^> Does anyone know what it means when you are trying to install graphene by " "Enter reason: no valid slot to boot"
06:42:10 <^Spyda^> When I press start, on this new phone, just just flashed and won't let me proceed
06:45:41 <^Spyda^> If i do recovery mode it just brings me to a scene with a green dead android and the words "no command"
06:50:04 <TheJollyRoger> ^Spyda^: just sneaked back for a sec, I think I got a better idea - you may have an old version of fastboot installed, but...
06:50:15 <TheJollyRoger> You can install GrapheneOS *from* GrapheneOS if you have a USB C to C cable.
06:50:20 <TheJollyRoger> It may be easier for you.
06:50:57 <TheJollyRoger> On the phone we just verified, open Vanadium, and use it to navigate to the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web . Plug your other phone into it.
06:51:01 <^Spyda^> I did that.. I just have done something wrong but I just followed https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
06:51:12 <^Spyda^> Did i permanently destroy this second phone?
06:51:33 <^Spyda^> because it can't be detected by adb anymore
06:51:49 <TheJollyRoger> It's not permanently destroyed, but it's been flashed by a version of fastboot that did not support autodetection.
06:52:09 <TheJollyRoger> Please use the web installer, go from GrapheneOS to GrapheneOS.
06:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> You can install GrapheneOS from GrapheneOS, it's probably the most robust solution.
06:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> Just use the web installer, you will find it much easier.
06:52:54 <^Spyda^> https://grapheneos.org/install/web ?
06:52:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
06:52:57 <^Spyda^> There?
06:53:01 <^Spyda^> It never works
06:53:11 <^Spyda^> Thats why I used the command instructions for the other install
06:53:17 <^Spyda^> It just says error no device selected
06:53:25 <TheJollyRoger> Try it from GrapheneOS, not from your desktop.
06:53:34 <^Spyda^> From the handset?
06:53:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
06:53:39 <TheJollyRoger> From handset to handset.
06:53:45 <^Spyda^> You can do that?
06:53:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
06:53:53 <TheJollyRoger> Note that the installing handset MUST be in fastboot mode for it to work.
06:53:58 <TheJollyRoger> Which... you can now only boot into.
06:54:39 <^Spyda^> So the installing and the installer handset both have to be in fastboot?
06:54:43 <TheJollyRoger> No.
06:54:53 <^Spyda^> just the one that im trying to install it ono?
06:54:54 <^Spyda^> *now
06:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. The handset that's already running GrapheneOS must be online and have Vanadium open.
06:55:33 <TheJollyRoger> The handset that it's being installed to must be online and be on fastboot.
06:55:46 <TheJollyRoger> You must be in the bootloader interface for it to flash, unlock, or relock.
06:55:49 <TheJollyRoger> Just as we did before.
06:55:49 <^Spyda^> Ok
06:55:55 <TheJollyRoger> If it's in any other state, fastboot can't talk to it.
06:55:59 <TheJollyRoger> And THAT'S why you get that error.
06:55:59 <^Spyda^> Well the new handset is in fastboot mode now
06:56:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Plug it in.
06:56:10 <TheJollyRoger> USB-C to USB-C.
06:56:21 <^Spyda^> it just flashed not recognised
06:57:00 <^Spyda^> Whats Vanadium?Should i research it now?
06:57:17 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium is the GrapheneOS web browser, it has a logo that looks like Chromium's except it's gray and silver.
06:58:00 <TheJollyRoger> I can't stay though. I have to be off now.
06:59:35 <TheJollyRoger> The installer's been extensively tested, be sure to read everything very carefully. Often there are small, but subtle things that you must do (or must not do) that trip people up.
06:59:37 <^Spyda^> ok all done
06:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> All finished? :)
06:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> Bootloader's locked and all?
06:59:58 <^Spyda^> i mean the two phones are connected
07:00:05 <^Spyda^> i had to connect to my other other phone for internet
07:00:17 <^Spyda^> Im on duckduckgo now lol
07:00:24 <^Spyda^> On the installed phone
07:00:29 <^Spyda^> and the broken phone is just sitting there
07:00:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. The installed phone, let it sit.
07:00:43 <TheJollyRoger> Er,
07:00:46 <TheJollyRoger> The broken phone, let it sit.
07:00:49 <^Spyda^> lol
07:00:49 <^Spyda^> ok
07:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> If you go into recovery, or other options, etc, then it's no longer in fastboot.
07:01:01 <TheJollyRoger> And you will get an error.
07:01:06 <TheJollyRoger> You MUST leave it in fastboot.
07:01:13 <^Spyda^> on the installed phone?
07:01:16 <^Spyda^> or broken one?
07:01:22 <TheJollyRoger> On the broken one, let it sit in fastboot.
07:01:34 <^Spyda^> yeah just just sitting there in fastboot mode
07:01:58 <TheJollyRoger> On the working phone, open up Vanadium and go to https://grapheneos.org/install/web and follow the instructions from there. Note that if you are in Incognito mode, it will fail.
07:03:13 <TheJollyRoger> I have to go. Good luck!
07:03:15 <^Spyda^> whys that?
07:03:19 <^Spyda^> Ok dude thnx!
07:03:28 <TheJollyRoger> The installer image is roughly 900 MB.
07:03:58 <^Spyda^> Ahhh it wont download my phone
07:03:59 <^Spyda^> lol
07:03:59 <TheJollyRoger> If you are in Incognito mode, what happens is the browser will typically go "Who the heck needs 900 MB for an incognito session? Nah, you're never going to need this..."
07:04:05 <^Spyda^> WhyYYyYY is this happening lol
07:04:16 <TheJollyRoger> and starts throwing out the files before fastboot.js is done using them.
07:04:50 <somenerd[m]> > If you are in Incognito mode, what happens is the browser will typically go "Who the heck needs 900 MB for an incognito session? Nah, you're never going to need this..."
07:04:50 <somenerd[m]> lol
07:05:09 <^Spyda^> Now it just won't connect at all on my phone hahaha
07:05:16 <^Spyda^> Oh wait
07:05:21 <^Spyda^> I think i n00bed out
07:05:32 <^Spyda^> In addition to my other n00b mistakes heheh
07:06:23 <^Spyda^> Thanks again Jolly!!!
07:06:46 <^Spyda^> At least im learning a bunch!!! Despite it being frustrating :P
07:09:25 <TheJollyRoger> Glad it's working!
07:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I gotta sleep. Night!
07:09:40 <TheJollyRoger> *klunk*
07:09:43 <TheJollyRoger> ZZZzzzz
07:56:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: good night
08:32:04 <thetranstocommie> ik there might not be a real answer to this, but is there a timeframe on when the google play services stub will be implemented? a couple of strictly necessary apps I have to use require it and I'd like to know if I should keep a burner phone for those.
08:49:10 <take_a_deep_brea> well  imo you should first check wether those apps you need work with play services disabled
08:49:23 <Thatcher[m]> There is no answer to that. Only Daniel knows, and his response would probably be something like this: When it's ready.
08:50:48 <Thatcher[m]> Or "You're welcome to start working on it"
08:52:00 <Thatcher[m]> It's a lot of work and probably not on the highest of priorities to bring Google functionality to a system that is anti-gapps
08:52:12 <strcat[m]> it won't provide any Google functionality
08:52:19 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
08:52:43 <strcat[m]> it will provide a disabled by default app with stub implementations of the APIs that don't do anything aside from reporting errors
08:53:06 <Thatcher[m]> * It's a lot of work and probably not on the highest of priorities to bring play cervix functionality back to Graphene
08:53:19 <strcat[m]> the way it's implemented can be based on what makes apps work but it won't actually do anything
08:53:21 <Thatcher[m]> * It's a lot of work and probably not on the highest of priorities to bring play service functionality back to Graphene
08:53:26 <take_a_deep_brea> <take_a_deep_brea "well  imo you should first check"> thats why i am asking them to check
08:53:51 <take_a_deep_brea> ok i think i too am mistaken
08:54:14 <take_a_deep_brea> disabling and then testing wont really help them
08:57:14 <Thatcher[m]> I do hope that stub implementation does come soon though, just for the sake of inhibiting talk of 'Cow Licks OS'
08:57:26 <take_a_deep_brea> <take_a_deep_brea "disabling and then testing wont "> as disabling play services isnt the same as simulating existence of play services which are temporarily unavailable
08:58:28 <take_a_deep_brea> Thatcher:  pmed you ,if you dont mind
09:00:22 <take_a_deep_brea> Thatcher:  you have a setting that disables sending encrypted messages to unverified session
09:00:29 <take_a_deep_brea> so unable to read your message
09:00:39 <Thatcher[m]> Lemme change that
09:00:54 <take_a_deep_brea> or use a verified session
09:04:06 <somenerd[m]> I think that means that you need to verify
09:04:08 <somenerd[m]> not them
09:04:58 <take_a_deep_brea> somenerd: its a strange message as this session is verified for me
09:05:40 <somenerd[m]> huh
09:06:01 <strcat[m]> it's their client that won't send messages to an unverified session
09:06:05 <strcat[m]> not your client that won't receive them
09:06:20 <strcat[m]> generally means they're using an out-of-date or broken (non-Element) client
09:06:31 <strcat[m]> Element is the only client that remotely works properly
09:06:37 <strcat[m]> and it's pretty broken itself so yeah
09:07:44 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah that makes more sense
09:19:13 <somenerd[m]> > Element is the only client that remotely works properly
09:19:13 <somenerd[m]> thought it was a setting lol
10:36:34 <nix0000[m]> Hey all, just wondering if you have a pixel phone linked to a specific SIM carrier, does it affect the installation at all ?
10:37:52 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <nix0000[m] "Hey all, just wondering if you h"> It does, carrier-locked phones usually have disabled the ability to unlock bootloader
10:40:53 <nix0000[m]> <DFuchsiaOS_when "It does, carrier-locked phones u"> With my sim carrier, there is an option on their website to actually unlock the phone after owning for a certain period so it may possibly work if I can unlock the bootloader ?
10:41:18 <DFuchsiaOS_when> Nah, unlocked carrier is not enabled to unlock bootloader
10:41:54 <DFuchsiaOS_when> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210214#c6912152
10:42:35 <DFuchsiaOS_when> You can use the command `adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid` to determine if bootloader is unlockable. It is unlockable if it shows all 0
10:43:45 <nix0000[m]> ahh awesome, Ive actually purchased the phone used and its on its way today, ive been looking around on some XDA threads and apparently the bootloader is unlocked on pixel phones with my carrier
10:44:05 <nix0000[m]> but I guess I'll see when it gets here :)
10:47:32 <nix0000[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: if the bootloader is unlocked but there is a carrier SIM lock, would that affect anything, Im new to grapheneOS, coming from lineageOS :D
10:48:25 <DFuchsiaOS_when> Not sure if such phone exists, but if the bootloader is unlockable, should be able to flash GrapheneOS
10:50:10 <nix0000[m]> okay i get you, thanks for helping me out :), yeah its strange Ive seen some info that my carrier has sold pixel phones with the ability to unlock the bootloader so it may work
10:51:37 * Thatcher[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xVrPrhkkNBNIZHQUAEGDkAmn/message.txt >
10:53:27 <nix0000[m]> ahh nice, yeah ive been looking for my carrier and I can call up and they will simply unlock it since I have purchased the phone used (pixel 3a)
10:53:35 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <nix0000[m] "okay i get you, thanks for helpi"> Just to be sure, ask the seller to run the command "adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid"
10:55:03 <nix0000[m]> <DFuchsiaOS_when "Just to be sure, ask the seller "> The phone was purchased from a company that buy/sell a bunch of different tech, but will check myself when it arrives, if not I can always just return and purchase an unlocked phone

11:38:01 <c4c3[m]> hey, is anyone on a 4a/4a xl?
11:41:05 <c4c3[m]> Is there an option for changing the vibration intensity? The default is way too high for me. I've looked through the settings but failed to find such an option. It was adjustable back on the 3a xl. Any ideas?
11:41:06 <Pratyush[m]> yes
11:41:21 <Pratyush[m]> <c4c3[m] "Is there an option for changing "> No i guess
12:00:46 <strcat> c4c3[m]: you can change it to some extent in Settings -> Accessibility
12:00:58 <strcat> Vibration & haptic strength option there
12:01:08 <strcat> you can lower the intensity for notifications
12:01:52 <strcat> and separately for touch feedback
12:02:08 <strcat> such as back button/gesture
14:06:37 <darbubu> I read here in chat that the eSIM works with GOS when it was set up under other firmware. I set up my eSIM under Stock. that worked. Then I flashed GOS, the eSIM did not work. Then I flashed CalyxOS, the eSIM works there. Also as DualSIM with another nanoSIM together it works. Tried GOS again today. the eSIM is without function :(
14:08:56 <DFuchsiaOS_when> It may be dependent on some carrier app bundled on other OS that's not on GrapheneOS
14:10:46 <quartz11[m]> <darbubu "I read here in chat that the eSI"> you need to activate d2ds
14:10:52 <quartz11[m]> <darbubu "I read here in chat that the eSI"> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159#issuecomment-765451235
14:12:13 <strcat> darbubu: because they include and use Google services and use Google's eSIM activation app
14:12:34 <strcat> darbubu: we don't take that approach so we have to fund the development of an open source eSIM app instead of using a closed source Google eSIM activation app and Play services
14:37:33 <darbubu> thank you! i will flash GOS again now and activate d2ds :)
14:51:50 <strcat[m]> Standalone hardened_malloc version 6 released: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/releases/tag/6
14:52:29 <alex-resist> Is there a substantial security benefit of deactivating JS in Vanadium? Or is its overall hardening sufficient so that having JS activated doesn't make much of a difference?
14:56:02 <madaidan[m]> alex-resist: Disabling JS would massively reduce attack surface.
14:58:29 <nix0000[m]> what would be best to use to install grapheneOS on a pixel 3a, CLI or the web install, or are they both the same
14:58:53 <somenerd[m]> Depends on if you want to verify the signature of the OS image
14:59:12 <somenerd[m]> (and have trusted cli packages)
15:06:29 <strcat[m]> nix0000: https://grapheneos.org/install/ explains the potential advantage of CLI install
15:06:42 <strcat[m]> if your OS doesn't provide usable fastboot and signify packages itself then there's no advantage for CLI
15:37:17 <nix0000[m]> thanks, id like to verify the signature so will go with CLI when I get my phone unlocked :)
15:37:36 <darbubu> d2ds activation works great:) Â i am happy, that i have Graphene OS with 2 SIMs:)
15:38:18 <nix0000[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: hey, just an update, the oem unlocking option is greyed out on my pixel, but called the carrier and I just have to wait 3 days for an unlock code :D
15:50:12 <HozerTech[m]> nix0000:  how did you talk the carrier in to unlocking? I have the same issue, oem unlocking is greyed out...
15:51:33 <thetranstocommie> <HozerTech[m] "nix0000:  how did you talk the c"> I've read just telling them you're a developer who needs it for work usually gets it done.
15:53:16 <HozerTech[m]> Huh. I'll give it another go.
15:53:16 <HozerTech[m]> Last time around i was told its for my own protection.... Needless to say, the conversation went south from there.
15:54:37 <thetranstocommie> its a total crapshoot as to whether or not they'll let you, which is why I try to buy unlocked.
15:55:16 <zvl12[m]> never buy a phone from a carrier....
15:58:46 <HozerTech[m]> So i have learned
16:05:25 <codebam> what's the difference between beta and stable?
16:07:47 <nscnt[m]> Internal testing > Beta > Stable
16:07:58 <nscnt[m]> Stable is... Stable
16:09:37 <nscnt[m]> Least likely where you'll run into issues
16:10:28 <codebam> are there new features in beta that aren't in stable?
16:11:30 <nscnt[m]> If there's a new beta, yes
16:11:58 <codebam> right now I'm on stable and I went into the updater and switched my release channel to beta. then I clicked check for updates but it didn't pull in the beta
16:12:02 <nscnt[m]> Beta and stable can overlap, though
16:12:05 <codebam> does that mean that stable is the same as beta right now?
16:12:48 <nscnt[m]> You can always have a look at the Release webpage
16:13:08 <codebam> yeah that's what I was looking at. how would I know if they're the same?
16:13:53 <codebam> they have the same date so I guess they're the same
16:13:55 <nscnt[m]> Version number
16:14:12 <codebam> actually yeah they download the same file
16:14:17 <codebam> cool. thanks for the info!
16:28:58 <bilto4433[m]> Hello. I'm trying to install Graphene on a Pixel 4a, and the flash script seems to be stuck. It's been on "Sending sparse 'system_a' 3/4" for at least 30 minutes.
16:29:32 <bilto4433[m]> I assume I'll have to stop the script and start again, but I want to make sure I stop it safely. Any ideas? Thanks.
16:31:27 <strcat[m]> bilto4433: ctrl-c stops it safely
16:31:31 <strcat[m]> it's designed in a way that's safe
16:31:41 <strcat[m]> bilto4433: sounds like you may have a broken USB cable / port
16:35:09 <bilto4433[m]> Yep, I saw in logs to try a different USB cable. I'm using the USB-C to C that came with it, but I can try another. Could also try the /tmp directory trick.
16:37:41 <bilto4433[m]> <strcat[m] "bilto4433: ctrl-c stops it safel"> I tried Ctrl+c, then Enter in the terminal. That didn't seem to do anything for a few minutes, so I did it again. Still nothing.
16:38:34 <bilto4433[m]> Unfortunately, I'm not all that familiar with what are probably basic terminal commands.
16:40:30 <strcat[m]> bilto4433: why are you using the CLI guide then?
16:41:30 <nix0000[m]> <HozerTech[m] "nix0000:  how did you talk the c"> with my carrier they actually allow you to unlock the phone for a small fee (in my case 8.99)
16:41:32 <bilto4433[m]> I figured I could follow the instructions there. And I don't use a browser compatible with the USB protocol, or whatever was required for the other option.
16:42:02 <nix0000[m]> > <@hozertech:fairydust.space> nix0000:  how did you talk the carrier in to unlocking? I have the same issue, oem unlocking is greyed out...
16:42:03 <nix0000[m]>  * with my carrier they actually allow you to unlock the phone for a small fee (in my case 8.99), I called them up and they have said they will send me an email in 3 days to pay for an unlock code
16:43:28 <nix0000[m]> as I have purchased this phone used but is locked to the same carrier I use currently I just called them up, gave them my IEMU number, and they said they will get back to me so hopefully they wont be long lmao

17:32:50 <nix0000[m]> seems like my carrier wont unlock my phone smh
17:33:07 <zzxx123> verizon?
17:33:19 <nix0000[m]> think I might purchase a pixel 4a, I just need it to be unlocked right ?
17:33:32 <nix0000[m]> <zzxx123 "verizon?"> the carrier for my pixel is EE
17:33:37 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: Yes, the easiest way to ensure you get an unlocked phone is to order it directly from Google Store.
17:33:55 <nix0000[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nix0000: Yes, the easiest way to"> ah okay cool ill have a look now
17:33:57 <TheJollyRoger> When you order it, you'll be asked whether you want a carrier or an unlocked version. Just select unlocked and you should be good.
17:34:47 <morepheus_x[m]> If i am not mistaken, unlocked pixels are available at Bestbuy.
17:34:56 <nix0000[m]> I was using lineageOS but want more privacy, as ive managed to make my setup to a decent level of privacy, only thing id do extra now would be using a laptop with opensource boot firmware lol
17:35:51 <TheJollyRoger> My own personal stance on this is: "don't gamble with a reseller or a refurb. You don't know where that phone has been, who sold it, or how well they'll actually honour their return policy, or if the kid being paid eight bucks an hour to sling those phones actually read the labels. Brand new from Google Store is your safest bet to avoid getting ripped off/cheated/left with a device you can't
17:35:54 <TheJollyRoger> use."
17:36:18 <nix0000[m]> <TheJollyRoger "My own personal stance on this i"> yeah thats the mistake I have made in this case
17:36:28 <TheJollyRoger> Aaargh, jeez that sucks man, sorry to hear it!
17:36:43 <nix0000[m]> no worries, I think I can still return it for a refund so should be fine
17:36:47 <TheJollyRoger> Whew!
17:37:44 <nix0000[m]> need a higher level of privacy for my mobile device lol, plug ill order a pixel 4a which will be updated for longer than the 3a
17:37:50 <nix0000[m]>  * need a higher level of privacy for my mobile device lol, plus ill order a pixel 4a which will be updated for longer than the 3a
17:38:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, the 3a will be on its way out in around a year, so the 4a will give you a better return on the investment.
17:38:29 <TheJollyRoger> Plus it will have slightly better security by merit of having a newer SoC.
17:39:07 <nix0000[m]> ahh nice
17:39:30 <nix0000[m]> does graphene OS do anything to mitigate cellular tracking ?
17:40:02 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: You can use airplane mode, then switch your WiFi back on.
17:40:37 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking A more detailed explanation is here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
17:40:49 <nix0000[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nix0000: You can use airplane mo"> ahh okay cool, yeah I really dont like using SMS/calling but its hard to convince people to use more secure/foss apps lol
17:40:57 <TheJollyRoger> The pain is real!
17:41:41 <nix0000[m]> its like that for various forms of communication
17:42:06 <nix0000[m]> if the other person doesnt care about privacy then your privacy can be impacted in the process
17:42:06 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to cellphone location, it's unfortunate, but your cellphone provider knowing which towers to route to is a fundamental way of how thecellphone network operates.
17:42:24 <TheJollyRoger> To do without it, would be like putting a letter in a mail without a destination or a return address.
17:42:58 <nix0000[m]> <TheJollyRoger "With respect to cellphone locati"> yeah thats true, EU privacy laws help too when it comes to what SIM providers can actually do with whatever data they collect so thats a benefit
17:43:12 <nix0000[m]> nice analogy :)
17:43:21 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: you got it! I've often said this before, but your privacy is determined via a co-operative, team-work effort, rather than individual competence/skill.
17:44:19 <nix0000[m]> yeah exactly, I just wish people around my took it more seriously,
17:44:25 <nix0000[m]>  * yeah exactly, I just wish people around me took it more seriously,
17:44:35 <nix0000[m]> you can only do so much to protect your privacy on your own
17:44:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
17:45:24 <bilto4433[m]> <bilto4433[m] "I tried Ctrl+c, then Enter in th"> Not sure if Ctrl-Break did anything. Ctrl-z worked, gave me a new prompt. I tried a different USB-A to C cable. I reran the script, and that seemed to work, and booted into Graphene. Probably would've been fine there. Just to be safe, I rebooted to the booloader and ran the flash script again with the new cable. Seems to be good now. Don't entirely understand what
17:45:24 <bilto4433[m]> Auditor does, but I ran it, and it seems to be good too.
17:46:09 <TheJollyRoger> Hi bilto4433[m], I can give you a brief rundown on Auditor if you like, although the best place to read about auditor is actually https://attestation.app/about here.
17:46:43 <nix0000[m]> the grapheneOS project seems great though, great way to provide a secure/private OS to end users, that isnt too difficult to install either
17:46:59 <bilto4433[m]> Thanks @strcat:matrix.org for the help. The website's install instructions were good. I'm just new to Linux/terminal, so my basic troubleshooting isn't great.
17:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> If you're in a hurry or this seems confusing, Auditor is a program that uses hardware-backed attestation (from the phone) to prove to another computer that the system image is signed, verified, and authentic against a known good digital certificate, the private key of which belongs to Daniel Micay.
17:47:48 <TheJollyRoger> So you can prove, with a high amount of certainty, that the version of GrapheneOS you've installed, is the one that Daniel Micay actually authored and digitally signed, on his own personal workstation/build server, right down to the last bit.
17:48:10 <TheJollyRoger> And that it hasn't been modified. Auditor does this *while the operating system is actually running!*
17:49:30 <TheJollyRoger> So even if the operating system tries to lie about its own authenticity, or gets compromised by something that tries to spoof its own authenticity, Auditor can still catch it red handed, because only Daniel Micay has the right set of keys to mark the operating system image as being the real one.
17:49:43 <m2tu[m]> Jolly this means, if someone setup fake dns and sent an update to the phone which we accept
17:49:54 <m2tu[m]> it will not acceptet that update ??
17:50:29 <m2tu[m]> does veryfied boot not also make this prevent ?
17:50:32 <strcat[m]> m2tu: read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
17:50:38 <strcat[m]> covered well there
17:50:47 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: Yes. There's an additional layer of protection in that even if someone hacked into the update server, and replaced the update images, the phone can't accept them anyways because it will be verified against the verified boot keys.
17:50:49 <strcat[m]> updates are signed and verified with downgrade protection
17:51:28 <strcat[m]> there's an update signing key (the OS releasekey) and then that's also used to sign the update_engine payload
17:51:28 <strcat[m]> and there's verified boot
17:51:29 <TheJollyRoger> The updates are cryptographically signed and verified, end-to-end, between you, and Daniel Micay. There are no middle men or trusted third parties.
17:51:43 <m2tu[m]> i we tryed to understad this better .. but i got it now ... its very powerfull tool
17:51:50 <TheJollyRoger> It's very powerful.
17:56:47 <nix0000[m]> TheJollyRoger: do you have to use auditor to verify the download file with the signature or could you use something like GPG
17:56:52 <m2tu[m]> do you guys think by disabling isntalling packages, forexample deny package isntaller from installing can rise security?
17:58:23 <nix0000[m]> I just read through the docs you use signify to verify the image if im not wrong
17:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: Nope, you don't, you use Auditor once the image has been installed on the phone. It functions once it's been installed, not prior to the installation. The attestation server or the auditing device uses the hardware backed keys and remote attestation for authenticity to a root of trust that's already authenticated, so it's not required to do it beforehand.
17:58:45 <bilto4433[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi bilto4433, I can give you a b"> No big hurry. Instructions suggested to run Auditor before network use, and it was pretty easy to do. So I just ran it before thoroughly looking into it. Thanks for the explanation too.
17:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: I would not mess around with the permissions to system apps. Those are already set by the developers, messing around with the permissions to them won't get you any extra security. They may break your operating system though.
17:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Or cause it to behave in weird ways.
17:59:39 <TheJollyRoger> bilto4433[m]: anytime, glad to hear she's working!
18:00:32 <nix0000[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nix0000: Nope, you don't, you us"> ahh I get you sorry, should have looked into it more, is using the auditor necessary to ensure system updates are verified or is it just to ensure that the image you have flashed onto the phone hasnt been modified ?
18:00:32 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: we do encourage you to use Signify if you have it in your operating system's signed and verified trusted repositories, but this is optional if you want the extra assurance beforehand. It's meant to suppliment the attestation model though, not replace it.
18:01:11 <m2tu[m]> I know but i mean if the phone cannot install any packages, what are the dangerous thats been left ??? remotecode exetution 0days  ?
18:01:20 <bilto4433[m]> if I want to reinstall stock Android, the stock factory images are found here, correct?
18:01:20 <bilto4433[m]> https://developers.google.com/android/images
18:01:33 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: Well, Auditor doesn't handle the updates, that's up to the update client, which functions on its own. Auditor though can do quite a lot more, actually. It's intrusion detection, which allows you to self-monitor your device.
18:01:37 <strcat[m]> bilto4433: yes
18:02:26 <nix0000[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nix0000: Well, Auditor doesn't h"> ah thats really cool, ill have to read into it more
18:02:38 <TheJollyRoger> bilto4433[m]: you got it. If you do want to revert back to stock, the same workflow applies, but there is one extra step and that's to remove the GrapheneOS keys while your bootloader is unlocked. You can do this at any time, of course bearing in mind that doing so will cause all the data stored on your phone to be lost.
18:04:32 <m2tu[m]> Jolly... but Auditor cannot detect spyapp ?
18:04:39 <TheJollyRoger> nix0000[m]: it's really great. If you're worried about your phone doing funny things while you're not looking, is to pair it with GrapheneOS' in-house attestation server, which you can ask to challenge the phone periodically to prove that it hasn't had its system image compromised, and then to warn you if it is
18:04:53 <m2tu[m]> forexample if u visit website and autoisntall .apk file ?
18:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: It can detect the presence of rootkitware that attempt to alter the system image or attempt to spoof the attestation data.
18:05:27 <m2tu[m]> ok
18:05:28 <TheJollyRoger> But it won't warn you if say, you install an app that contains trackers but otherwise plays by the rules.
18:05:44 <TheJollyRoger> And you give it permission to use the cameras, use location, search your contact list, etc.
18:07:16 <strcat[m]> m2tu: no such thing as 'auto installing' an apk
18:07:21 <TheJollyRoger> So for instance, if you try to gain root with Magisk, which functions like rootkitware, Auditor can actually detect that.
18:07:48 <TheJollyRoger> But it won't stop you from installing say... WeChat.
18:07:51 <TheJollyRoger> or TikTok.
18:08:11 <strcat[m]> please read https://attestation.app/about
18:08:11 <TheJollyRoger> nor will it care if you've got those apps installed.
18:12:09 <TheJollyRoger> I believe both WeChat and TikTok are invasive, but as far as I know they don't attempt to gain superuser/root access on your device.
18:12:36 <TheJollyRoger> But that's a topic for another time.
18:13:00 <grayhatter> TikTok downloads code from the mothership and runs it locally
18:13:20 <TheJollyRoger> grayhatter: Ohhhhhh yeooowwwwch that's preeeeetty terrifying.
18:16:59 <grayhatter> if you ever insteall tiktok, you should assume your phone has been pwned, and act accordingly
18:20:08 <nix0000[m]> <grayhatter "if you ever insteall tiktok, you"> microwave the phone
18:39:15 <zzxx123> download code?
18:42:11 <TheJollyRoger> Well, to be fair, so does the browser. Apps on android are always sandboxed though, and breaking out of the sandbox would require a kernel exploit.
18:42:17 <rafff[m]> Hi, I have created a second user (X). I am trying to install signal on this user X. It requires during signal setup that I receive an sms, but I do not receive the sms. My setup is using a vpn + airplane mode on + wifi on. I succesfully installed signal in the owner profile. Any ideas how to solve this?
18:42:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hi rafff[m], turn off Airplane mode.
18:42:50 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise you won't recieve SMS on profiles that have the phone permission.
18:43:28 <rafff[m]> do I need to turn on mobile data too?
18:43:44 <TheJollyRoger> No, but I'm not understanding the threat model here.
18:43:57 <TheJollyRoger> You need to be able to recieve SMS in order to get the text.
18:45:57 <TheJollyRoger> Turning off cell data but with airplane mode off will still allow you to send/recieve SMS and phone calls, but I don't understand what the concern is here, unless you pay by the minute and need to make sure your cell data is kept to an absolute minimum to avoid billing shock.
18:47:28 <TheJollyRoger> Incoming SMS messages will be received in profiles that have been granted access to the phone.
18:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> The owner profile always has access to the phone.
18:50:24 <rafff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The owner profile always has acc"> I finally managed to finish the setup in signal. But I realized during this process that the sms does not arrive at the new created user (X) but it arrived at the owner.
18:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
18:52:10 <rafff[m]> Thx for support JR.
18:52:24 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!

19:16:36 <nix0000[m]> seem to have an issue purchasing from the google store not sure why, looking on other websites, does SIM free necessary mean that the phone is unlocked or that it just doesnt come with a sim card ?
19:16:54 <nix0000[m]> some of these mobile phone descriptions dont tell much aha
19:19:14 <carbonatom[m]> You can also purchase it through amazon. And I guess sim free means without their esim, but I'm not sure.
19:19:45 <penpal[m]> Hey guys! is it ok to ask a noob question about the pixel 4a 5g in this channel?
19:20:02 <nix0000[m]> yeah true, on amazon some sellers have asked about the phone being unlocked and people have replied saying yes
19:21:12 <carbonatom[m]> What version are you purchasing?
19:23:27 <nix0000[m]> google pixel 4a
19:23:41 <nix0000[m]> seems like a good choice for long term security updates
19:23:48 <carbonatom[m]> https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-4a-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B08CFSZLQ4?ref_=ast_sto_dp
19:23:54 <carbonatom[m]> This one comes unlocked
19:24:06 <carbonatom[m]> Purchased it myself a few months ago
19:25:37 <nix0000[m]> ahh nice, its not available in my region, the current one im looking at says for "wireless carrie = unkown wireless provider type"
19:25:47 <nix0000[m]>  * ahh nice, its not available in my region, the current one im looking at says for "wireless carrier = unknown wireless provider type"
19:26:05 <nix0000[m]> in the questions, people say the device is unlocked
19:27:24 <nix0000[m]> https://www.amazon.co.uk/Google-Android-Mobile-battery-Nightsight-Just-Black/dp/B08F7ZM2G4/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=google+pixel+4a&qid=1613503631&s=electronics&sr=1-4
19:27:58 <carbonatom[m]> Everything that comes from Google Store or their Amazon Store will be unlocked.
19:28:09 <m2tu[m]> The optimal system protecting would be fingerprinting guard which guard all apps installed and acepted, then alarm for every change thats made, is there such of app ?
19:28:59 <nix0000[m]> ahh I didnt even see it was from the google store lmao my bad
19:29:04 <nix0000[m]> ill order it now :D
19:29:50 <carbonatom[m]> nix0000: Hope you enjoy it. It's a great phone considering it's price.
19:30:31 <nix0000[m]> thanks :), I'm going to enjoy walking around with a bit of extra privacy in my pocket
19:32:55 <timeo[m]> i kinda need some help with installing grapheneos
19:33:11 <timeo[m]> im trying do install it on my pixel 5
19:33:28 <strcat[m]> timeo: use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
19:33:36 <timeo[m]> i did that
19:33:42 <timeo[m]> but i got a issue
19:34:32 <timeo[m]> it wont start flash-all.bat
19:35:12 <timeo[m]> when click on it it start for a moment and then it close cmd
19:35:21 <timeo[m]>  * when click on it it start for a moment and then it the close cmd
19:36:15 <carbonatom[m]> You'll be better off doing web install
19:36:20 <carbonatom[m]> It's much easier
19:36:38 <timeo[m]> web install?
19:36:41 <timeo[m]> was that
19:37:11 <nix0000[m]> is the only difference that you cant verify the signature beforehand, you can only verify afterwards using auditor if done using web install ?
19:48:02 <Justauser> Hi how are you. I bought honor 10 lite and I found that I can't unlock bootloader
19:48:03 <Justauser> Is there anyway to do that please?
19:48:17 <Justauser> I want to install your Os.
19:50:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Justauser, please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
19:50:33 <TheJollyRoger> As well as https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
19:51:46 <TheJollyRoger> It's likely even if you do find a way to unlock the bootloader, you won't be able to rekey it with full support and full hardware security features for non-vendor operating systems. Only Google devices fully support that with full co-operation from the OEM. Your best bet is to return the Honor 10 and go buy a Pixel 4a.
19:53:04 <Justauser> Even if not fully supported, I don't like Huawei os
19:53:18 <Justauser> I read that on this article
19:53:25 <Justauser> GrapheneOS also supports generic targets, but these aren't suitable for production usage and are only intended for development and testing use. For mobile devices, the generic targets simply run on top of the underlying device support code (firmware, kernel, device trees, vendor code) rather than shipping it and keeping it updated. It would be
19:53:25 <Justauser> possible to ship generic system images with separate updates for the device support code. However, it would be drastically more complicated to maintain and support due to combinations of different versions and it would cause complications for the hardening done by GrapheneOS. The motivation doesn't exist for GrapheneOS, since full updates with
19:53:26 <Justauser> deltas to minimize bandwidth can be shipped for every device and GrapheneOS is the only party involved in providing the updates. For the same reason, it has little use for the ability to provide out-of-band updates to system image components including all the apps and many other components.
19:54:08 <TheJollyRoger> Justauser: First line: development and testing use. Unfortunately, you are on your own for that.
19:54:55 <TheJollyRoger> Some people here may be able to help you, but I doubt that handset you bought will be adequate because it likely doesn't support bootloader unlocking.
19:55:42 <Justauser> :(
19:55:56 <m2tu[m]> have u tryed to sideload stock image ?
19:56:05 <m2tu[m]> not flashing ?
19:57:18 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: Not possible without an exploit, or if the verified boot implementation is broken.
19:57:33 <Justauser79> Idk this is my first time on this phone
19:57:40 <TheJollyRoger> In the case of the latter, that indicates an insecure handset that is likely defective by design.
19:57:59 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you do get the bootloader unlocked, it likely won't support relocking with 3rd party keys.
19:58:19 <Justauser79> :'(
19:58:34 <TheJollyRoger> Justauser79: I suggest returning the handset for a refund and buying a Pixel 4a if you would like to run GrapheneOS.
19:59:05 <Justauser79> Anyway thank you
19:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
19:59:12 <Justauser79> Yeah I will do that
19:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! Your safest bet is to buy directly from the Google Store.
20:18:07 <docJ> I'm needing help with APN on my 4a.
20:18:38 <docJ> does anyone know how to add a new APN and get it to save?
20:21:44 <timeo[m]> flash-all.bat still doesnÂ´t work
20:21:57 <rny> timeo[m]: use the web installer
20:21:58 <timeo[m]> it only start for a sec
20:22:15 <rny> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:22:21 <sphinxcat[m]> timeo: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:22:21 <timeo[m]> im not 100% sure how that works
20:22:49 <rny> timeo[m]: you just need to press the buttons on the page
20:24:07 <timeo[m]> i see now and i did follow all the steps
20:25:02 <timeo[m]> install adb, unlock bootloader, moved all files
20:31:29 <rny> you are not following the web installation steps
20:31:40 <rny> does not say you need to install adb
20:32:16 <timeo[m]> i did follow it and i watch a video
20:32:19 <kepoff[m]> <timeo[m] "flash-all.bat still doesnÂ´t work"> have you tried running it as admin?
20:32:47 <timeo[m]> im making a short video do show

20:34:06 <rny> timeo[m]: what video.
20:34:17 <rny> we dont have a video tutorial
20:34:30 <kepoff[m]> <timeo[m] "2021-02-16 21-29-47.mkv"> try right-clicking flash-all.bat and running it as admin
20:34:58 <take_a_deep_brea> kepoff: please stop right there .
20:35:05 <take_a_deep_brea> no clicking needs to be done
20:35:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <kepoff[m] "try right-clicking flash-all.bat"> strcat delete
20:35:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please read our official guide
20:35:53 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  please follow the official guide on the website
20:36:07 <strcat[m]> timeo: follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:36:20 <timeo[m]> <rny "timeo: what video."> i know but i was looking for some help on youtube
20:36:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or use the webusb installer
20:36:29 <strcat[m]> timeo: don't, those are inaccurate and unsafe
20:36:37 <strcat[m]> timeo: if you follow an unofficial guide from youtube, you can't get help here
20:36:47 <strcat[m]> timeo: you need to remove all the stuff they told you to download/install
20:36:48 <strcat[m]> undo it
20:36:54 <strcat[m]> follow our official guide
20:37:01 <strcat[m]> if you follow a video from youtube, you can't ask for help here
20:37:06 <strcat[m]> you have to go ask the video author for help
20:37:19 <timeo[m]> first off, i follow the guide on the site
20:37:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "undo it"> *system restore noises*
20:37:53 <timeo[m]> i was just look how other people did it
20:38:07 <timeo[m]> and i did install grapheneos before on my pixel 3a
20:38:14 <timeo[m]> that work
20:38:54 <strcat[m]> timeo: adb is NOT used for the installation process
20:39:05 <strcat[m]> timeo: no files should be moved
20:39:10 <timeo[m]>  i know and i remove that
20:39:20 <strcat[m]> you're following inaccurate unofficial guides and I really hope you did not install that third party adb they suggest
20:39:27 <strcat[m]> 'minimal adb / fastboot' is unsafe third party software
20:39:37 <strcat[m]> timeo: please just follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:39:58 <strcat[m]> timeo: all you have to do is connect the device in bootloader interface mode, install the driver in Windows Update optional updates, push buttons and wait
20:40:14 <timeo[m]> google drivers as well?
20:40:20 <strcat[m]> just do exactly what's there
20:40:23 <strcat[m]> nothing else is required
20:40:29 <strcat[m]> there is no need to do anything no in the official guides
20:40:36 <strcat[m]> both web and cli guides are complete
20:40:37 <strcat[m]> web is easier
20:41:10 <timeo[m]> i guess im just a unlucky windows user
20:42:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Minimal adb also installs conflicting drivers btw
20:42:55 <timeo[m]> i removed adb and i followed the guide
20:43:01 <strcat> timeo[m]: Windows works fine, following unofficial guides was a big mistake and has now made things harder
20:43:07 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  its alright , you will be fine just do what strcat said above , follow the official installation guide , preferably the webusb one if you have Edge browser  and if you have any issues you can ask help here
20:43:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Add the fact that there is no way to even tell who made it
20:43:23 <strcat> timeo[m]: please do not follow any other unofficial guides
20:43:33 <timeo[m]> <strcat "timeo: Windows works fine, follo"> i havenÂ´t change anthing do my device yet
20:43:37 <strcat> timeo[m]: you now potentially need to uninstall drivers they uninstalled via device manager
20:43:37 <timeo[m]> only on windows
20:43:48 <strcat> timeo[m]: I don't know what you did per unofficial guides
20:43:50 <timeo[m]> i can just reinstall windows
20:43:59 <strcat> timeo[m]: just follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:44:29 <timeo[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
20:44:32 <timeo[m]> still the guide
20:44:35 <timeo[m]> i follow
20:44:47 <timeo[m]> on my pixel 3a it work fine
20:45:26 <timeo[m]> i followed this video on youtube
20:45:43 <rny> that techlore video hasnt aged well
20:45:43 <timeo[m]> you know what let met start over
20:45:45 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  do not follow unofficial videos
20:45:49 <rny> ð
20:45:59 <take_a_deep_brea> if you look below that video at the comments
20:46:11 <take_a_deep_brea> even he recommends following the guide
20:46:17 <thetranstocommie> id just follow the written instructions on graphene's website. they work much better in my experience.
20:47:47 <xx> timeo[m]: I don't know about windows but when I tried to flash on linux couldn't find my device or get it connected through the web install on any browser.. But chrome worked fine for me. I don't know if its just or chrome must be used but i'm just telling you my experience.. Maybe the guys here will be more of a help.
20:48:08 <xx> Also the only time i installed GOS on windows was through chrome.
20:48:20 <chmod700[m]> Heard grapheneOS mentioned on Michael bazzle's privacy and OSINT podcast. But he uses iPhone as primary, I wonder why
20:48:36 <xx> I'm no expert just telling you my experience.
20:48:43 <zzxx123> ok
20:48:46 <take_a_deep_brea> and someone please remove the video link lol
20:49:07 <thetranstocommie> if you're installing through Linux and using the web installer, you need to use a chromium based browser, and in my experience flatpaks don't work, and I wouldn't be surprised if snaps didn't either.
20:49:12 <timeo[m]> i can use linux as well
20:49:28 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  windows works just fine for installation
20:49:37 <timeo[m]> not for me
20:49:42 <timeo[m]> windows sucks sometime
20:49:52 <xx> windows worked fine for me the first and only time i tried it on windows through chrome
20:49:56 <take_a_deep_brea> all you need is a good usb port good usb c-c cable and Edge or chromium
20:50:22 <timeo[m]> yeh, but my issue is cmd doesnÂ´t start up
20:50:26 <xx> use the ports that are direct to the mother as the ones in the I/O
20:50:37 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  use the web installer
20:50:48 <xx> web installer doesn't require and cmd commands
20:50:50 <take_a_deep_brea> and  you are not supposed to use cmd anyways
20:51:02 <take_a_deep_brea> powershell
20:51:18 <take_a_deep_brea> is what is needed for windows cli installation
20:51:25 <timeo[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "timeo:  use the web installer"> im doing that right now
20:51:31 <take_a_deep_brea> great
20:53:32 <xx> good luck!
20:53:55 <timeo[m]> Â¨On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot.Â¨
20:54:01 <timeo[m]> is it fasboot and adb the same?
20:54:36 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo: you dont need adb for installation
20:54:59 <take_a_deep_brea> the driver should be available as an optional windows update
20:55:06 <xx> exactly
20:55:23 <timeo[m]> okay, i did all step so far
20:55:32 <zvl12[m]> i think i found a mini bug on 4a5G experimental : receiving a text message on main profile : it rings and vibrate, but receiving on secondary profile, it vibrates only (and all is set correctly to ring as well).... or maybe i am the bug !?
20:55:40 <timeo[m]> im at flashing part
20:55:54 <take_a_deep_brea> good
20:56:10 <xx> profile as in shelter? or you mean as alt-user?
20:56:23 <xx> or second user?
20:56:28 <Thatcher[m]> <chmod700[m] "Heard grapheneOS mentioned on Mi"> He uses iPhone because the MySudo app won't work without Google Play services
20:56:50 <penpal[m]> zvl12: hey howâs the experience with graphene on the 4a 5G apart from that bug? Does it feel pretty experimental?
20:57:09 <zvl12[m]> <xx "profile as in shelter? or you me"> main user : works fine, adding a secondary user : only vibrates (but phone call does ring)

20:59:56 <strcat[m]> timeo: stop doing that
21:00:12 <strcat[m]> timeo: you are absolutely not supposed to do that
21:00:28 <timeo[m]> oh why so?
21:00:30 <strcat[m]> timeo: as said above, you need to stop following unofficial guides
21:00:49 <strcat[m]> timeo: please follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web

21:01:21 <timeo[m]> i dont know anymore
21:01:21 <strcat[m]> timeo: follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web - at no point do you download and extract that
21:01:29 <chmod700[m]> <Thatcher[m] "He uses iPhone because the MySud"> Interesting. I think he also uses a mic blocker, so whatever iPhone he has, has a headphone jack

21:07:50 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: either that or get the driver from Google, your choice
21:07:58 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: you don't have the fastboot driver, that's why it doesn't work
21:08:03 <strcat> you can either get it from Windows Update or Google
21:08:14 <strcat> it will show a random vendor name in Windows Update

21:12:08 <strcat[m]> that's why it doesn't work
21:12:16 <nscnt[m]> It doesn't say Google Driver in Windows Updates as already said. It's a weird sounding vendor name
21:12:20 <strcat[m]> you have 2 choices: follow what our guide says, or follow what Google's USB driver says

21:12:31 <strcat[m]> you haven't done either, so it won't work
21:12:34 <strcat[m]> until you do it, it won't work
21:12:39 <strcat[m]> I recommend following what our guide says
21:12:47 <strcat[m]> install the bootloader interface update from Windows Update
21:12:48 <strcat[m]> it will work
21:13:17 <tedlancer[m]> <strcat[m] "you have 2 choices: follow what "> yeah i did the lemobile one as u suggested
21:13:25 <strcat[m]> edge is fine
21:13:52 <tedlancer[m]> it worked!
21:13:57 <tedlancer[m]> thank u guys
21:14:13 <tedlancer[m]> so the fastboot was the issue
21:14:32 <tedlancer[m]> sorry this might sound moronic but i m new to this
21:14:43 <tedlancer[m]> i might have to pop up again for help
21:15:49 <docJ> I'm having trouble setting up a APN with this OS. Does anyone know how to allow user access to APN Setting in Graphene?
21:16:41 <timeo[m]> after reading guide again, and now i understand it
21:16:56 <timeo[m]> but it cant find the device with edge
21:17:04 <timeo[m]> any tips?
21:17:26 <strcat[m]> docJ: asked if you had a device manager, need to check that in Settings -> Security -> Device admin apps
21:17:33 <strcat[m]> timeo: you need to install the driver as it says
21:17:47 <strcat[m]> timeo: someone else just had the same issue above, but you followed third party guides that may have screwed stuff up
21:18:11 <docJ> I dont have anything under device damin apps
21:18:19 <docJ> Device admin apps
21:18:48 <timeo[m]> <strcat[m] "docJ: asked if you had a device "> thanks for the help so far, let me check :D
21:18:56 <strcat[m]> docJ: are you in the Owner account atm?
21:19:13 <strcat[m]> timeo: the device admin thing was not in reply to you
21:19:16 <docJ> yes
21:19:28 <timeo[m]> i know
21:25:16 <docJ> I'm the owner account but I dont have any device admin apps
21:26:35 <timeo[m]>  so far it looks fine
21:27:00 <timeo[m]> im using chrome with installing it
21:27:05 <strcat[m]> timeo: did you flash and then lock the bootloader?
21:27:16 <timeo[m]> not yet im wating for downloading
21:27:22 <strcat[m]> okay
21:27:34 <strcat[m]> once it finishes downloading and you start flashing, make sure not to do anything until finishes
21:27:39 <strcat[m]> then proceed to locking it once it finishes
21:28:53 <timeo[m]> oh i didÅt know that it lock automatic after  the fashliing
21:28:55 <timeo[m]> thats cool
21:29:05 <timeo[m]>  * oh i didÅt know that it lock automatic after  the flashing
21:29:38 <timeo[m]> i thought i had do locked it thats how i did it last time
21:29:49 <warmjuice[m]> timeo:
21:29:50 <take_a_deep_brea> timeo:  no , you need to lock it
21:29:56 <timeo[m]> i know
21:30:23 <take_a_deep_brea> well , errr , good then .
21:32:22 <timeo[m]> since last time i thought it was a bit hard for me do unsterstand the guide on the site but is kinda easy
21:32:33 <timeo[m]>  * since last time i thought it was a bit hard for me do understand the guide on the site but is kinda easy
21:33:03 <docJ> strcat[m]:Â Â I'm the owner account but I don't have any device admin apps not sure what to do from here
21:40:20 <docJ> Does anyone know how to allow user access to APN Setting in Graphene?
21:42:24 <strcat> it works by default
21:42:40 <strcat> unless it's not supported by the carrier
21:43:17 <timeo[m]> oke im done flashing
21:44:03 <strcat> now lock with the lock button
21:44:06 <strcat> and confirm it
21:44:09 <strcat> and make sure it's locked
21:44:36 <timeo[m]> it worked!!
21:44:48 <timeo[m]> thanks do you all

21:50:53 <zvl12[m]> on 4a5G : entered Aurora store to update Signal, and got in the phone notifications : org.thoughtcrime.securesms SUCESSFULLY INSTALLED ?? Is this related toSignal that I just installed or is this a direct hit on GOS from Aurora ?
21:51:53 <zvl12[m]> <zvl12[m] "on 4a5G : entered Aurora store t"> seems to be the packet name for Signal ... i was already aaaaaaa
22:21:50 <the-real-johndoe> Hi guys, after the pandemic is over, i want to go and travel allot and take memorable pictures. The only issue i have with that is, what can i do about the airports going through my phone without even needing a consent for it? It is easy to go into a country while u have a clean install running of grapheneOS. But how do i get out without they getting getting a copy of the pictures i made while being there?
22:24:01 <strcat> the-real-johndoe: take them all in a secondary profile
22:24:12 <strcat> the-real-johndoe: encrypt them and upload them somewhere
22:24:22 <strcat> delete the secondary profile so the data is irreversibly gone
22:24:51 <strcat> the-real-johndoe: or just factory reset if there is really nothing on the device to lose
22:25:00 <strcat> but deleting a profile reliably wipes all data in it
22:25:06 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
22:27:22 <nrt[m]> Hey guys I have a pixel 3 and when I end session on a user profile, tap to wake and raise to wake sometimes fails to wake screen. Anyone else experience this? Thanks
22:28:50 <mmcblk0[m]> yes me too, and sometimes loged without promt authentification ...
22:28:50 <the-real-johndoe> <strcat "delete the secondary profile so "> Oh wow that was really easier than i thought thank you so much for ur explanation!
22:45:45 <strcat[m]> the-real-johndoe: a factory reset will also do that for the device as a whole
22:45:50 <strcat[m]> including owner profile data
22:46:02 <strcat[m]> but it's a lot more convenient generally to just delete secondary profiles which were created for specific things
23:01:50 <zvl12[m]> <the-real-johndoe "Oh wow that was really easier th"> or do a third profile ONLY for pictures...
23:03:28 <zzxx123> or just turn it off
23:10:50 <zvl12[m]> <zzxx123 "or just turn it off"> some modern border controls or you give the phone and password, or it is being seized (with you sometimes), that's why the plausible deniability has its value
23:14:05 <zvl12[m]> <zvl12[m] "some modern border controls or y"> the other "Monica" profile ? ah thats my ex GF ... (or BF)
23:14:53 <xfil> would it have been too difficult to phrase that question in a way that doesn't scream "I plan to go molest children in a third world country and take photos"?
23:16:56 <xfil> it would be nice to have some kind of hidden profiles though
23:17:45 <the-real-johndoe> <xfil "would it have been too difficult"> My bad im just gonna travel with my wife
23:19:06 <the-real-johndoe> * My bad im just gonna travel with my wife and if u would do that she would probably kill me twice
23:19:41 <xfil> I hope your wife is a consenting adult
