00:11:19 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <strcat[m] "@room we need feedback on whethe"> My BT earbuds are working fine
00:11:35 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> * My BT earbuds are working fine (Pixel 3XL beta)
00:15:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Not ignoring this request, I don't yet have a USB DAC in hand, and only Bluetooth audio in the car, which I haven't driven in a while. :(
00:34:14 <skagreek[m]> Got a couple bluetooth devices. On RQ2A.210305.006.2021.03.02.10 and everything works. Even connects using LDAC.
00:35:40 <skagreek[m]> BTW, the newer Pixel's bluetooth have excellent range.
00:36:20 <strcat[m]> skagreek: Wi-Fi / Bluetooth is provided as part of the SoC these days
00:36:24 <jay46> b4 putting grapheneos on. I was using stock and separating the few apps like netflix and pandora into shelter work profile. I was advised to use a second user instead of a work profile. So I am going to try that. But I still want to get calls when i am listening to pandora in the 2nd user profile. Is the idea that without stock phone/contact apps
00:36:24 <jay46> if am app tried to Query for that information it wouldnt even find it?
00:36:36 <strcat[m]> skagreek: baseband really has cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in different sandboxes on it
00:37:35 <strcat[m]> jay46: that's not really the advice
00:38:10 <strcat[m]> and we recommend using secure calls and secure messaging
00:38:13 <jay46> its hard for me to figure out.. to not totally give up on having an ap like pandora... what the best way is to still have it.. or spotify .. to still have all that music with me wherever
00:38:14 <strcat[m]> rather than carrier-based calls/texts
00:38:20 <jay46> i have signal
00:38:51 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you're talking about in terms of not having stock phone/contact apps
00:38:55 <strcat[m]> or what you think that has to do with profiles
00:39:02 <jay46> ttry to get as many contacts as possible to use it.. I am doing the best version of what I can.. but nothing but wanted the best privacy i can get at my level.. so still use a few convenience things but not sure best way to go about it
00:40:02 <jay46> the grapheneos Phone app and Contact app are different I thought.. or setup different, but fuck do i know.. trying to learn though, thought maybe think i got that wrong though about contact/phone
00:41:13 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed without profiles
00:41:20 <strcat[m]> profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox
00:41:22 <strcat[m]> not their purpose
00:41:43 <strcat[m]> the purpose of profiles is that each one has separate instances of each app and separate data
00:41:49 <strcat[m]> without shared data / communication across them
00:42:14 <jay46> okay...   Where can I read about how grapheneos has apps sandboxed
00:42:16 <strcat[m]> so yes, there is a separate contacts database for each profile, separate instance of the contacts app too, just like with all other apps and profile data
00:42:29 <strcat[m]> that's the purpose of profiles
00:43:03 <skagreek[m]> <strcat[m] "skagreek: baseband really has ce"> Cool, just looked it up. Didn't know it's all part of the baseband proc.
00:43:40 <jay46> I would understand the advice would be to not put a single app like Spotify or Pandora on the device. But since I just want the most private device I can get, so I got the pixel 5 for graphene, but still want to have that much music in my palm, just was wondering the safest ways to add those type of apps to the phone
00:43:43 <strcat[m]> skagreek: it's a specialized processor handling all the radio stuff in separate sandboxes
00:44:04 <strcat[m]> skagreek: used to be there was a separate baseband for Wi-Fi / Bluetooth
00:44:19 <strcat[m]> jay46: that's not our advice
00:44:26 <strcat[m]> you're making incorrect assumptions about what we advise
00:44:43 <jay46> I guess I misunderstand then. Sorry.
00:46:20 <skagreek[m]> strcat: Pretty amazing. Learning some neat stuff here daily!
00:47:06 <strcat[m]> skagreek: Wi-Fi / BT was almost always 1 baseband though
00:47:10 <strcat[m]> not separate
00:48:57 <skagreek[m]> strcat: 5G and bluetooth on one chip, woulda never guessed. But I guess it's really all the same and same frequency ranges.
00:55:36 <skagreek[m]> strcat: Quick question. I realized the stable and beta builds are the same on my beta install. Is it because there is no beta released to test yet? i'm on this: RQ2A.210305.006.2021.03.02.10
00:59:23 <sjsndnjdejd> @freenode_jay46:matrix.org using privacy offending apps one a separate profile to a  daily use profile does make you more private. Recommend reading the profile section on the website.
01:00:06 <jay46> i going to go look for that section
01:01:25 <skagreek[m]>  * strcat: Quick question. I realized the stable and beta builds are the same on my beta install. Is it because there is no beta released to test yet? i'm on this: RQ2A.210305.006.2021.03.02.10 (maybe a dumb question lol)
01:02:59 <strcat[m]> skagreek: https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
01:03:17 <strcat[m]> > Releases are tested by the developers and are then pushed out via the Beta channel. The release is then pushed out via the Stable channel after being tested by some users using the Beta channel. In some cases, problems are caught during Beta channel testing and a new release is made via the Beta channel to replace the aborted one. In general, it's not possible to downgrade unless a downgrade update package is
01:03:17 <strcat[m]> generated, so use the Stable channel if you cannot tolerate dealing with temporary issues while a new release for the Beta channel is being created.
01:03:21 <skagreek[m]> I had a shirt 20 years ago, said RTFM. Thanks for the link.
01:03:34 <strcat[m]> Beta and Stable usually have the same release
01:03:42 <strcat[m]> when a release is in progress, it starts in internal testing, goes to Beta, then Stable
01:03:51 <strcat[m]> unless a non-trivial problem is caught requiring making a new release
01:04:01 <skagreek[m]> Got it, thank you.
01:04:06 <strcat[m]> and then that new release goes through internal testing, Beta, then Stable, as before
01:04:22 <strcat[m]> when you get a Stable channel release
01:04:36 <strcat[m]> the exact release you get was already tested in the internal channel and then publicly via Beta channel
01:04:39 <strcat[m]> that's the point of the channels
01:05:46 <skagreek[m]> besides knowing that i clicked and installed beta, is there a way to know in the OS?
01:12:18 <jay46> I read the Security and Privacy - How disk encryption is implemented - Section. Thats seems to be the spot talking about how high security users would only use the main profile for managing other profiles. For me .. It seemed like my level security - I would only add a few open source apps to the main user, such as vpn/email/note taking app/task
01:12:18 <jay46> app/ maybe a couple other things from Fdroid tops. And make a second profie/user for Music, and another separate one for Instagram which I use for jewelry business stuff with an anonymous (as much as possible) account. The question I was trying to ask...  When I setup another profile it asks if I want to let it make phone calls, well.. I could be
01:12:19 <jay46> in music user for a long time listening to music on Pandora and I cant miss calls, so I set it up for calls, and I wondered if by doing that, and even loading contacts in, whether or not Pandora could without me wanting it to, capture call and contact information.
01:17:11 <sjsndnjdejd> If don’t grant it the perms it won’t
01:20:06 <sjsndnjdejd> Honestly I would use only 2 profiles, anything more than that starts to feeling like getting out of hand
01:20:33 <jay46> okay... i just feel like these apps are fucking sneaky. When I was using shelter and a work profile on my stock setup I could wrap my head around them(privacy offending apps) being boxed away from my calls and contacts. I feel it would be helpful to be able to have a work profile within a second user, main profile of that second user is just there
01:20:33 <jay46> for calls and txts, and work is for that non private app or two.
01:21:11 <jay46> and with the work profile shelter app I felt I really was able to for 100% freeze an app and only unfreeze one at a time when i wanted to use it
01:22:50 <jay46> maybe in graphene i can be more confident when I close out an app in the second profile but am still using that second profile for another app, that whatever app I have closed out, is for sure not persistant in the background
01:25:50 <sjsndnjdejd> profile sessions can be ended safely in the global action menu by holding the power button
01:28:38 <jay46> right I got that part for sure I understand that. I meant if I have a few apps, netflix, pandora, spotify, instagram, in a Second User, that they really are not running in background or communicating with each other. If I only have one open at a time, and close it before opening another. In shelter I would only unfreeze one app at a time. Without
01:28:38 <jay46> that freeze option, in a second user, I just wondered how well these type of apps actually shut down, when I close one to use another, but staying in that 2nd user to use other aps, as opposed to what you just wrote totalling ending session and going bak to admin.
01:33:20 <strcat[m]> jay46: again, apps are sandboxed
01:33:29 <strcat[m]> jay46: again, profiles do not provide a better sandbox
01:33:52 <strcat[m]> if the app has a sandbox bypass (i.e. a serious exploit for the OS) profiles do not do anything to protect against that
01:34:02 <jay46> Is there some reading material on the aps being sandboxed
01:34:06 <strcat[m]> jay46: you do not give an app access to your contacts, etc. by installing it
01:34:17 <strcat[m]> jay46: profiles rely on the *same app sandbox* as usual
01:34:30 <strcat[m]> any trust you have in profiles is based on the same app sandbox that's always there
01:34:51 <strcat[m]> I already explained above that the purpose of profiles is that they are a separate workspace, with separate instances of apps and profile data
01:35:19 <strcat[m]> they do not make the app any more sandboxed
01:35:24 <strcat[m]> same sandbox
01:35:48 <strcat[m]> jay46: you do not do anything special for apps to be sandboxed, there is no way for you to install an app that is not sandboxed
01:36:05 <strcat[m]> what you choose is what data to enter into it, which permissions to grant it, what access to grant it other than that
01:36:35 <jay46> i guess I just felt its hard to trust the software to not let data slip ...
01:36:41 <jay46> trust any software
01:36:50 <strcat[m]> jay46: you seem to misunderstand what profiles are
01:36:55 <strcat[m]> jay46: they do not provide a better sandbox
01:37:01 <strcat[m]> an app like Shelter does not provide any sandbox at all
01:37:14 <strcat[m]> the app sandbox is always there, for every app you install
01:37:16 <strcat[m]> same app sandbox
01:37:48 <jay46> shelter seemed like it created a world where if an app tried to look at your contacts or phone calls or internet history it would only see in that profile.. yes unless it was some major exploit i could get that
01:37:54 <strcat[m]> no
01:38:03 <strcat[m]> Shelter does not provide any sandbox of any kind
01:38:09 <strcat[m]> the only sandbox is the OS sandbox
01:38:17 <strcat[m]>  * the only sandbox is the OS app sandbox
01:38:47 <strcat[m]> jay46: I've explained what profiles are, there are 2 forms of profiles: user profiles and work profiles
01:39:00 <jay46> i get that
01:39:00 <strcat[m]> jay46: both are implemented by the OS, both are relatively similar
01:39:07 <strcat[m]> but work profiles are owned by the device manager app, not you
01:39:30 <strcat[m]> and the device manager app is responsible for their semantics and how isolated they are from their parent user profile
01:39:39 <sjsndnjdejd> <jay46 "i guess I just felt its hard to "> Sessions are profile based not app based. You can create an invidual profile for an invidual app if you want.
01:39:43 <strcat[m]> and also device managers tend to have scope creep where they demand a bunch of other privileges
01:39:48 <strcat[m]> beyond work profile management
01:40:12 <strcat[m]> for unclear reasons when they claim to be about that
01:40:35 <jay46> i guess i also think in terms of say... on a linux computer I could make a Virtual Computer with a specific purpose.. One Virtual Computer per each specific purpose. So it seems like that would be a useful thing on a phone, have multiple virtual phones within one device each with separate purposes.. if that makes sense
01:41:17 <jay46> I took your previous advice against Device Managers and looked at all the privileges one wants and can see what you are saying.. to the degree of my understanding
01:41:48 <strcat[m]> jay46: please read what was already stated about user profiles
01:41:59 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you aren't understanding
01:42:27 <strcat[m]> jay46: already explained in detail that user profiles are isolated workspaces
01:42:27 <jay46> I think I am. I was just writing ideas right there.. not going back to saying I thought user profiles worked like virtual computers
01:42:32 <strcat[m]> jay46: all apps are sandboxed regardless
01:42:50 <strcat[m]> jay46: no, you're stating something that demonstrates you haven't read and understood most of what I've written
01:42:53 <strcat[m]> over a long period of time
01:42:59 <strcat[m]> so I suggest going back and reading all of it
01:43:03 <jay46> fuck me.. maybe :)
01:43:08 <strcat[m]> and I'm now going to be unwilling to continue this since I feel you aren't reading
01:43:22 <jay46> I swore you were saying no point to making separate users
01:43:49 <strcat[m]> that's absolutely not what I said
01:44:08 <strcat[m]> jay46: you seem to *wrongly* think that you need profiles to get sandboxing which you absolutely don't
01:44:18 <strcat[m]> jay46: apps are sandboxed either way, with the *same* sandbox
01:44:20 <snikita[m]> hey all, im following the instructions on the grapheneos cli installation docs, and im at the step where im running `./flash-all.sh` but there is no output in the terminal, and looking at htop, the process is using 0% cpu and 0% memory. my phone doesnt look like its doing anything, and i watched a video where someone installed grapheneos and it looked like there is supposed to be some output.
01:44:20 <snikita[m]> Could i be doing something wrong, or should I just keep waiting for it? its been 10 minutes and I havent seen any output yet
01:44:32 <strcat[m]> snikita: yes, you're doing something wrong
01:44:39 <strcat[m]> snikita: it has output right away if it's working
01:45:04 <strcat[m]> snikita: I assume you're on a Linux distribution? make sure to read what was stated in the guide about udev rules and about USB
01:45:10 <strcat[m]> you should be using the USB cable that comes with the phone
01:45:13 <strcat[m]> if you aren't, that's likely your issue
01:45:27 <jay46> Okay.. I think some confusion may be that I was not on point some times in my typing/writing above and using the word Profile when I meant User.   I totally gave up on the work profile thing after your advice yesterday.
01:45:42 <strcat[m]> jay46: there are 2 kinds of profiles: user profiles and user profiles
01:46:02 <graphenehelpplea> Can I get some help installing? I'm using the web installer in google chrome on Ubuntu 20.04. At the "Flashing factory images" step, I clicked and it did some stuff but now installer web page says "Error: Unable to claim interface." Device is on "fastbootd". Is there a common errors page I can look though?
01:46:05 <strcat[m]> jay46: apps are sandboxed regardless, and profiles do not provide a better sandbox
01:46:16 <strcat[m]> graphenehelpplea: means something else is running like adb
01:46:35 <strcat[m]> graphenehelpplea: make sure adb isn't running
01:46:47 <graphenehelpplea> hmm.. no terminals open.
01:46:50 <strcat[m]> graphenehelpplea: reboot the phone back to the bootloader interface and reboot your computer
01:46:55 <snikita[m]> strcat: I installed udev following the instructions: `sudo pacman -S android-udev`, did I need to do something else in addition to that? I didnt see any other instructions besides to download that package
01:46:57 <strcat[m]> graphenehelpplea: adb runs as a service in the background once you use it
01:47:04 <strcat[m]> graphenehelpplea: if you used adb at any point it is running in the background
01:47:17 <graphenehelpplea> Oh, I see. Ok I'll restart. Thanks!
01:47:25 <strcat[m]> snikita: no, that's it, but you also need to plug in the phone after doing that
01:47:32 <strcat[m]> snikita: and make sure to use a USB cable that works
01:47:40 <strcat[m]> snikita: majority of USB-A to USB-C cables are defective and don't work
01:47:49 <snikita[m]> oh maybe i had it plugged in before i did that. that might be it. and yeah im using the stock phone cable
01:47:52 <strcat[m]> snikita: read the section it has on USB
01:48:04 <strcat[m]> snikita: try a different port
01:48:21 <snikita[m]> @strcat so should I unplug the device, reboot device, and reboot my computer and try again? is it safe to do that if the command is hanging?
01:48:32 <strcat[m]> snikita: it's safe to stop flashing at any point
01:48:42 <strcat[m]> snikita: and it didn't start, anyway
01:49:03 <strcat[m]> you can ctrl-c the flashing at any point and it's safe
01:49:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "jay46: there are 2 kinds of prof"> strcat before they've had some coffee lol
01:49:10 <strcat[m]> you just won't have an OS installed
01:49:35 <strcat[m]>  * jay46: there are 2 kinds of profiles: user profiles and work profiles
01:55:06 <jay46> strcat - I reread everything.. think I am getting it better. Workspaces for separate workspaces - different instances of apps etc. The FAQ say "Our recommendation for a high security setup is to use the owner profile only for managing other profiles." so there is something to at least making my daily driver phone setup in a secondary user if I
01:55:06 <jay46> understand that correctly.
01:57:14 <pinkylittlecat[m> <strcat[m] "they probably don't actually hav"> unfortunately they do have a hard dependency in the login system, which sucks a lot.
01:58:24 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it's not completely blocked if having it makes that work
01:58:44 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it's pretty common for apps to have a hard dependency on Play services
01:58:58 <pinkylittlecat[m> how much work would be necessary to have that google play services mock? im so pissed that i might as well help developing this
01:59:01 <strcat[m]> what I'm saying is that for many of those apps, they don't actually truly have a hard dependency on it
01:59:11 <strcat[m]> so if there is a stub Play services
01:59:15 <strcat[m]> even though it provides nothing
01:59:18 <pinkylittlecat[m>  * how much work would be necessary to have that google-play-services-mock-thing? im so pissed that i might as well help developing this
01:59:23 <strcat[m]> many apps can start working because they don't truly need it
01:59:26 <strcat[m]> they just didn't handle it not being there
01:59:39 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: really not a lot of work to just get started on it
02:00:27 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: even just a completely non-functional stub app with no APIs that's simply called the right thing (i.e. the app id of Play services) already is enough to make some really stupid apps work
02:01:01 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so, then the next step is GrapheneOS publishing that and signing it with a key we consider our GrapheneOS stub Play services signing key
02:01:14 <strcat[m]> which we then have the OS show other apps to be the Play services key
02:01:26 <hypokeimenon[m]> What does "on my LineageOS with google completely blocked" mean?
02:01:34 <hypokeimenon[m]> Does it have microG?
02:01:38 <strcat[m]> so now they see it as actual Play services and it passes the signature check, while not reducing security, since we're just trusting our own first party key to appear to be that key
02:01:46 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon🖤‍❤️🏳️‍🌈: microG is certainly not that
02:01:50 <strcat[m]> microG is literally Google services
02:01:55 <strcat[m]> a less secure implementation of them too
02:02:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> "Google completely blocked" doesn't make sense to me.
02:02:22 <strcat[m]> I already questioned that
02:02:29 <strcat[m]> don't need to continue it beyond what I said
02:03:05 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so baseline is stub Play services + stub Play store apps, signed with special first party keys we then make the OS show to other apps as being the Google keys
02:03:24 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: i.e. app is signed with our Play services key -> show other apps it's signed with Google's Play services key
02:03:34 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: needs to be done in a very specific way like that to avoid breaking the security model
02:03:42 <strcat[m]> or trusting other parties
02:03:54 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: then next step is starting to fill in all the APIs with stubs
02:04:05 <pinkylittlecat[m> <hypokeimenon[m] "Does it have microG?"> no, gms nano i guess, i dont remember which one i installed but it was the minimal real google play services package. the "completely blocked" part means i eliminated all permissions it could possibly use to reach the internet, and i usually monitor the network traffic to make sure this shit wont ever see the internet. playstore is disabled but google play services needs
02:04:05 <pinkylittlecat[m> to be enabled for stuff to work
02:04:18 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it's a library though
02:04:30 <strcat[m]> so, it being present will allow apps to do stuff with it even if it can't connect to network itself
02:04:36 <strcat[m]> it's both a set of libraries + services
02:04:46 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: some stuff ends up being done in context of app using it
02:05:11 <pinkylittlecat[m> <strcat[m] "pinkylittlecat: needs to be done"> i understand. i've a very strict view on security, like.. doing memory scans on my own to make sure a password was not really leaked because of the garbage collector from C# (example from work lol).
02:05:13 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so for example there's the Google AdMob library for displaying ads in apps, it has both full and lite versions, most apps use lite version
02:05:31 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: the difference is that the full version has everything needed bundled with the app
02:05:32 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: the lite version requires Play services to deduplicate the code
02:05:37 <pinkylittlecat[m> > <@strcat:matrix.org> pinkylittlecat: needs to be done in a very specific way like that to avoid breaking the security model
02:05:37 <pinkylittlecat[m>  * i understand. i've a very strict view on security, like.. doing memory scans on my own to make sure a password was not really leaked because of the garbage collector from C# due to internal usage of String types (example from work lol).
02:05:43 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: a LOT of Google libraries like that only really use Play services for code deduplication
02:05:44 <strcat[m]> it's dumb
02:06:42 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so as an example there, a stub Play services will make an app that demands working AdMob via Play services, it just won't do anything for the app, it'll act as if it can't connect
02:06:50 <strcat[m]>  * pinkylittlecat: so as an example there, a stub Play services will make an app work that demands working AdMob via Play services, it just won't do anything for the app, it'll act as if it can't connect
02:06:58 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: same for many other things, like FCM
02:07:05 <strcat[m]> it just has to say oh hey can't connect to FCM
02:07:08 <strcat[m]> the app will work fine
02:07:11 <strcat[m]> unless it's really badly implemented
02:07:37 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so hopefully that makes sense, and then ideally we do mostly auto-generated code via a text format we make specifying the APIs
02:07:44 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: since most stubs will look similar
02:07:53 <pinkylittlecat[m> <strcat[m] "pinkylittlecat: so baseline is s"> "we then make the OS show to other apps as being the Google keys" <- this would be the signature spoofing i suppose, which is strictly only used in this scenario, and only this scenario, right?
02:07:56 <strcat[m]> and we want to stub out 100% of the APIs basically
02:08:37 <pinkylittlecat[m> btw im not sure if this chat is bridged to matrix, but i noticed a small delay
02:08:39 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: yeah, but we would have a specific 'Play services' key and the only spoofing is to make the GrapheneOS Play services key work as the Google Play services key
02:08:56 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: Matrix is just laggy
02:09:12 <strcat[m]> (not specifically matrix.org, all the servers)
02:10:05 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: a surprising amount of apps will work with just stub Play services + stub Play Store with 0 actual API stubs implemented just from them appearing to be around
02:10:10 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: and then it goes from there
02:10:36 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: and not actually trying to reimplement the functionality makes it much easier to do it properly + robustly + securely
02:11:15 <strcat[m]> microG skips doing stuff like key pinning for TLS and other forms of it for local app components, etc.
02:11:18 <strcat[m]> among other issues
02:11:44 <strcat[m]> I feel like they are somewhat ideologically opposed to doing things securely in some cases
02:11:52 <strcat[m]> it's just not worth dealing with it
02:13:52 <pinkylittlecat[m> yeah i sense a kind of "making things right" rather than "making things work" here
02:14:13 <pinkylittlecat[m> which is good
02:20:59 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: yes so similarly we decided the web installer was the right approach to the install method for most people and CLI for experienced users in a way that they can verify the code before running any script
02:21:44 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so people got annoyed at us for not doing some kind of installer script to curl into bash before we got that done but now it's done
02:22:41 <strcat[m]> also the reason we don't bundle F-Droid and intend to make our own app install/update system
02:23:10 <strcat[m]> don't want to take shortcuts with serious issues or that just aren't workable long term
02:24:22 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: too infeasible to fork microG, make it secure, and make it work substantially better, plus it'll keep being unavailable for each new major release for a period of time
02:24:44 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: and it's a tiny subset of the functionality, apps can depend on more functionality at any point, and the existing functionality it implements bitrots
02:25:01 <strcat[m]> it's so much simpler to aim for 100% API coverage where nothing works on purpose
02:25:20 <strcat[m]> and since it just reports errors, etc. don't need to deal with much security / privacy concerns
02:26:13 <strcat[m]> and it has simple semantics: it doesn't provide functionality / doesn't 'work' so app functionality using Google services, etc. won't work but the app gets errors reported to it and has the library dependency satisfied
02:28:23 <strcat[m]> ultimately want apps that the developers intend to work on Android rather than only Android with Play services (not included in baseline definition of Android)
02:29:24 <strcat[m]> anything less is a workaround, but there can be a robust and secure workaround, which you can depend on to do what it's supposed to do (i.e. report errors to the app, pretend Google was wiped off the planet with nukes)
02:38:22 <ted_lavender[m]> I am wondering how well GrapheneOS can isolate trackers found in apps downloaded on Aurora? I need to use several apps that contain tons of trackers, are these isolated to run only when the app they are contained is runs?
02:39:09 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: think you're misunderstanding how the application model, permission model, etc. work
02:39:16 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: all apps are sandboxed, you can't install an app that isn't
02:39:33 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: apps cannot run code outside of their sandbox
02:40:11 <strcat[m]> apps cannot access personal data that you or another app in their profile doesn't give to them (if you give an app data, you trust it not to give that data to others)
02:40:22 <strcat[m]>  * apps cannot access personal data that you or another app in their profile doesn't give to them (in general if you give an app data, you trust it not to give that data to others)
02:40:57 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: you'll need to define what you actually mean by 'tracker' and what you are trying to accomplish
02:42:00 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: I'm not sure how a third party library for say, reporting crashes is a tracker especially if the user has to consent to uploading it, so maybe just don't buy into the misleading labelling made by those apps
02:42:37 <strcat[m]> an app doesn't need some third party library to use data you provide it in a way that is privacy violating
02:42:49 <strcat[m]> third party libraries are just more code, that works the same way as the code they wrote
02:42:55 <strcat[m]>  * third party libraries are just more code, which works the same way as the code they wrote
02:43:49 <strcat[m]> so, it's simply misleading to label apps based on common third party libraries they contain without knowing how they use that code, and similarly it wrongly implies that apps not including those common third party libraries are good
02:44:48 <strcat[m]> so, say app A uses a third party crash reporting SDK to upload crashes to a third party service with user consent
02:44:49 <ted_lavender[m]> A few trackers as identified by the Aurora Project include Facebook Analytics (com.facebook.appevents), Braze (com.appboy), and New Relic (com.newrelic.agent).  My primary concern is that these trackers could collect and send data from my device while the app is not in use.  I understand your point and appreciate your explanation.  I haven't been able to find much information online.
02:45:10 <strcat[m]> app B has no third party libraries like that but rather simply uploads your data to their server then gives it to facebook
02:45:25 <strcat[m]> app A is labelled as having a third party 'tracker'
02:45:26 <strcat[m]> app B is not
02:45:40 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: all apps are sandboxed
02:46:07 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: again, apps don't have access to personal data not given to them by you or indirectly by you by another app in the profile you gave it to
02:46:35 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: if they simply rename the library package names, etc., it won't be detected as a 'tracker' by what you're looking at
02:47:04 <strcat[m]> it's just looking at what libraries they include with certain classified as trackers
02:47:22 <strcat[m]> it doesn't know how the app uses it
02:47:30 <strcat[m]> it may be opt-in, you may have to consent to submitting usage data
02:47:38 <strcat[m]> it can't know that from looking at which libraries they include
02:47:44 <strcat[m]> it's a bad way to judge apps
02:48:06 <strcat[m]> you're just misleading yourself into thinking apps with those are bad and those without aren't
02:48:49 <strcat[m]> see app A and app B examples above
02:49:01 <ted_lavender[m]> Honestly, if all apps are strictly sandboxed then my concerns are over
02:51:05 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: they only get some basic information on the system properties (device model, OS) and global configuration (like locale and other things obviously exposed to apps)
02:51:09 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: see our FAQ for more details
02:51:21 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: they have to request access to personal data from you
02:51:32 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: and note apps within a profile can communicate with mutual consent
02:52:14 <strcat[m]> across profiles requires using the network
02:52:58 <strcat[m]> ted_lavender: those analytics SDKs are tracking your usage of the app itself, and they do not need a third party analytics SDK to do that
02:53:27 <ted_lavender[m]> Thanks for your detailed response, I am checking out the FAQs now
02:53:36 <strcat[m]> including one of those third party libraries doesn't give them any more capabilities it's just more code inside their app sandbox
02:54:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> OH.
02:54:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I really did not know that.
03:43:18 <snikita[m]> strcat: btw it ended up working. i used the web installer which worked fine. thanks for your help
03:45:21 <mr_hebi_san[m]> You can even communicate with some of these analytics services without using official SDKs.  Nothing is stopping you from writing your own NewRelic communication code, for example.  Its just a data blob in a format they recognize.
03:46:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Then Aurora stores report wouldn't even find the call to NewRelic.  It would just be com.mystuff.analytics which they don't know about and which makes web requests to newrwlic
03:51:25 <Guest44882> Heya, I was wondering if anyone knew about why the Pixel 4XL won’t be supported for long? I just got it for installing GrapeneOS, and feel stupid for missing the part under the recommended devices.

05:34:17 <chi00[m]> do multiple mobile devices on a network share the same IP?
05:35:03 <snikita[m]> depends. if youre talking about a typical home setup where those devices all share the same router, then usually yes they have the same public ip
05:37:27 <zzxx123_> search whats my ip  you'll know
05:37:43 <chi00[m]> Sorry, mobile devices ona carrier network
05:37:51 <zzxx123_> still
05:38:43 <snikita[m]> i dont know much about wireless phone networks but id assume each device has its own ip, probably ipv6
05:39:07 <snikita[m]> and yeah zzxx123 makes a good point, if you ever wanna check, just search "whats my ip"
05:40:54 <chi00[m]> yeah Ill check now then check in a few days. I read that mobile data IP addresses refresh each time you connect or disconnect
05:41:36 <snikita[m]> yeah its not as simple as home networks thats for sure.

10:16:46 <Ca> Hej everybody, I am installing graphene os with ubuntu. when I tried to flash, nothing happens on the terminal nor on the phone. The terminal is stuck and the phone keeps on showing the fastboot mode mit all the information including that the device state is unlocked. I am scared to break the device. Do you have any ideas how to proceed from here?
10:16:47 <Ca> That would be wonderful
10:17:23 <strcat[m]> follow the official guide
10:17:35 <strcat[m]> web installer (recommended): https://grapheneos.org/install/web
10:17:42 <strcat[m]> CLI install: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
10:18:11 <strcat[m]> Ca: if you were following an unofficial guide, remove everything it told you to install / download and reboot to make sure you don't have any of it left running
10:18:13 <Ca> that is what I did.
10:18:40 <strcat[m]> Ca: okay, so you've read the content about USB ports, USB cables, and about udev
10:18:43 <Ca> I followed the official guid
10:18:49 <strcat[m]> you aren't providing enough information
10:19:11 <strcat[m]> Ca: so have you read and followed those instructions?
10:19:33 <Ca> I read everything about the cables and ports. I followed the instructions.
10:19:56 <Ca> Unlocking the bootloader functioned well.
10:20:46 <Ca> But now everything is stuck.
10:21:10 <strcat[m]> okay, so provide more information about those topics
10:21:11 <strcat[m]> USB
10:21:13 <strcat[m]> udev
10:21:32 <strcat[m]> you need to explain what you've done in more detail
10:21:44 <strcat[m]> are you using the USB cable that comes with the phone as recommended?
10:21:49 <strcat[m]> did you install the udev rules package?
10:21:54 <strcat[m]> more info
10:22:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​ehilisticBluesman> ?
10:22:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​ehilisticBluesman> hi guys, why grapheneos uses prebult kernel while building, not like e.g. los, building it from source with os?
10:22:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​ehilisticBluesman> afaik aosp from google built same way, but why
10:22:44 <Ca> I though the udev rules package was preinstalled. I use an usb cable from sony.
10:23:29 <strcat[m]> the Linux kernel isn't built with the AOSP build system
10:23:52 <strcat[m]> components not build with the AOSP build system are built separately rather than running a non-properly-integrated build system nested within it in a way that screws up incremental builds
10:24:32 <strcat[m]> why would you run that make command nested inside in a way that doesn't use the build environment appropriately and screws up incremental builds?
10:24:40 <strcat[m]> question seems backwards, since we do it the standard way
10:25:02 <Ca> ok, I have little clue what that means, but I will research that. Do you think I can disconnect the phone now or shall I reboot ubuntu.
10:25:06 <strcat[m]> Ca: use the USB cable that comes with the phone as recommended, and no the udev rules aren't preinstalled, there's coverage there on it
10:25:35 <Ca> I am a beginner.
10:25:36 <strcat[m]> Ca: if you *have to* use a USB-C to USB-A cable due to lack of a USB-C port, you will need a high quality one that's to spec
10:25:40 <strcat[m]> most USB-C to USB-A cables are broken
10:26:00 <strcat[m]> Ca: recommend the web installer and make sure to follow everything there
10:26:05 <Ca> ok. my usb cable did not fit my laptop
10:26:23 <Ca> ok thanks for this recommendation
10:26:49 <Ca> do you think I can unplug the phone now?
10:26:55 <strcat[m]> you'll need a USB-C to USB-A cable that works properly then
10:26:59 <strcat[m]> Ca: you can unplug the phone
10:27:17 <strcat[m]> you can stop the flashing process at any time, you just won't have an OS installed on it if you partially completed flashing
10:27:39 <Ca> and shall I restart it then or lock the bootloader before
10:28:15 <Ca> thank you very much for your advice.
10:28:55 <strcat[m]> no point in locking
10:28:57 <strcat[m]> just start over
10:29:05 <strcat[m]> you need a high quality cable
10:29:08 <strcat[m]> issue was probably your USB cable
10:30:27 <Ca> thank you!
10:30:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <k​evinpigar> Yes sorry, Have just seen it
10:31:32 <Ca> it was the USB port! I tried it with another one
11:36:20 <interesting[m]> strcat: cat are the plans to enable eSIM for pixel 4a in future?
11:37:31 <strcat[m]> see issue tracker
11:37:45 <strcat[m]> please don't ping me for something you can look up or in general that isn't urgent
11:46:57 <interesting[m]> <strcat[m] "please don't ping me for somethi"> sorry.

16:58:05 <dannyknoll3[m]> Highly recommend looking at their documentation and evaluating their team if you're going to trust their tool.
16:59:15 <dannyknoll3[m]> Apps that have Google analytics in them will have it regardless of where or how they're downloaded.

17:07:34 <qieko[m]> 👍👍👍👍
17:09:21 <Guest3231> So I installed Graphene, but then the phone never launches into the OS, any help?
17:09:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Stuck on Graphene logo ?
17:10:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> For how long ?
17:10:14 <Guest3231> No, I'm stock in the bootloader
17:10:19 <Guest3231> *stuck
17:10:55 <qieko[m]> does it launch into stock rom?
17:11:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Web installer ?
17:11:12 <Guest3231> Yeah, I managed to reinstall Android
17:11:47 <Guest3231> I tried the install with the command line, which resulted in my current issue, then I tried the Web Install, which gave me the same issue
17:12:34 <Guest3231> Pixel 5, btw
17:12:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I would have used the Web Installer first.
17:13:24 <Guest3231> Ah, I see, well, even after reinstalling Android, I still got this issue :(
17:14:00 <Guest3231> What I mean, is that I retried reinstalling Graphene, but there was the same error
17:14:10 <Guest3231> Android works like it should
17:15:58 <Guest3231> I got the phone directly from Google, but - to my knowledge - there isn't any lock on the devices, since it isn't from a carrier
17:18:07 <Guest3231> Is there any advice at to what I should do?
17:18:13 <Guest3231> *as to what
17:18:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> What error exactly ?
17:18:23 <bauershades[m]> Anyone else problems with calling or getting calls after last update?
17:18:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Nope
17:18:56 <bill_in_mtl[m]> No problems here
17:19:31 <Guest3231> That's what strange. There isn't a stated error, just that it won't boot from the boot loader. I tried generating a tmp file with the error in Windows Powershell, but it didn't work
17:20:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> What happens when you start the device ?
17:20:13 <qieko[m]> are you flashing from the latest firmware?
17:21:14 <Guest3231> It flashes to the google symbol, then back to the bootloader, saying "restart bootlader" which I did. Then I started the device again, but it resulted in the same thing
17:21:50 <qieko[m]> do you have logs from flashing?
17:22:27 <Guest3231> I apologize, as I am new to the command line and flashing and such. How would I go about generating the logs?
17:22:57 <qieko[m]> i just wondered if it said failed at some point
17:23:05 <qieko[m]> that happened to me
17:23:13 <qieko[m]> when it didnt work
17:23:41 <Guest3231> From what I could see, I didn't get any "failed" message
17:25:19 <Guest3231> I'm trying again, using the web installer, and if it doesn't work this time, I have no idea
17:28:02 <Guest3231> "Error: Bootloader replied with FAIL: Fastboot: Invalid command update-super:super:wipe"
17:30:34 <Guest3231> Does that error point towards anyting?
17:30:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Refresh the page
17:30:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Make sure you're in the bootloader
17:30:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ans try again
17:30:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guest3231: yes
17:31:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> It means that you are booted into the bootloader
17:31:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should be booted into userspace fastboot for that command
17:31:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is probably a bad mistake or not following the installation guide correctly
17:31:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> * This is probably a bad usb cable, some mistake or not following the installation guide correctly
17:31:57 <Guest3231> I did exactly as the installation guide told, following very carefully
17:32:13 <Guest3231> Let me try another cable, I suppose
17:37:40 <Guest3231> Now "Error: Unable to claim interface."
17:38:16 <Guest3231> I'm at the fastbootd screen
17:41:59 <Guest3231> I would really appreciate help
17:43:05 <Guest3231> These errors come up, despite me following the install guide quite carefully
17:46:09 <Guest3231> Is there a reason why I'm not receiving help?
17:46:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> yeah
17:46:29 <Guest3231> I apologize, but I don't see what I've done wrong
17:46:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> sorry i'm busy with development rn
17:46:39 <Guest3231> That's fair
17:47:19 <Hooly[m]> <Guest3231 "These errors come up, despite me"> Which OS did you use to flash your phone?
17:47:32 <Guest3231> Windows
17:49:21 <Hooly[m]> You could try using a Linux live system and See if that works better.
17:49:21 <Hooly[m]> I used Linux Mint 20.1 and a USB-A to USB-C cable from my Nintendo Switch.
17:49:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> not recommended
17:49:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> there are memory constraints on live systems
17:50:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> if you don't have enough ram, gg
17:50:58 <Hooly[m]> I See, Guest3231 do you happen to have a spare storage drive at your disposal?
17:51:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> take a moment to look at the error
17:51:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> his device isn't booting into fastbootd
17:51:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> try to find out what the device is doing
17:51:38 <Guest3231> Yeah, I have a USB
17:52:14 <Guest3231> Well, it does go to fastbootd, but then it doesn't launch the OS
17:52:28 <Guest3231> I tried a different USB cable, but that didn't seem to help
17:53:24 <Guest3231> And, strangely, I successfully reinstalled Android, which doesn't make me think that the cable is at fault or the port
17:53:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Was it carrier-locked when you boughr it?
17:54:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> *bought
17:54:25 <Guest3231> No, I bought it directly from Google, so it *shouldn't* be locked
17:55:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> This does not seem good.I am having flashbacks of the atrocity I have done to my Samsung Galaxy Fame by flashing the wrong model's ROM.
17:56:29 <Guest3231> I flashed the Pixel 5 Graphene ROM. I mean... it shouldn't be wrong...
17:56:38 <Guest3231> On a Pixel 5, of course
17:58:09 <Guest3231> It's just a really strange error. I don't exactly know what the problem is, since I *seemed* to have followed the steps correctly
18:04:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> reall;y angry at this community tbh
18:08:04 <bill_in_mtl[m]> What are you angry about ?
18:09:33 <Real[m]> Who is angry?
18:12:32 <mynacol[m]> Guest3231: To fix the "unable to claim interface" error, you should restart the computer and open the web install page only once (or try in one single terminal the CLI install). There is some other daemon/program trying to access the phone as well.

20:17:30 <mishmasher[m]> Hi all I'm trying to install f-droid on another user profile but, when I do it just says "Didn't install" I'm assuming this has to do with the version of android running on my owner profile
20:19:20 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> correct
20:31:12 <mr_hebi_san[m]> mishmasher: It's the version of f-droid, not the version of Android.  Make sure the new apk is at least the same version number or higher
20:54:09 <entry1[m]> <mishmasher[m] "Hi all I'm trying to install f-d"> Version 1.10 is what you downloaded and it updates to 1.11 (have to download that in the second profile)

21:09:11 <mishmasher[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "mishmasher: It's the version of "> I meant version of F-droid not android, typo haha. I'm downloading the latest version from f-droid's site. There are also no updates available in the f-droid app on the owner profile... Hmmm
21:09:56 <sphinx[m]> mishmasher: the main download link is an outdated apk
21:11:49 <sphinx[m]> mishmasher: download it from https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/ - ignore the blue button
21:12:19 <mr_hebi_san[m]> yep, worst UI choice ever :)
21:14:14 <mr_hebi_san[m]> They seem to think that it's better to let people use a "more stable" version that is better tested, but that very same version almost immediately prompts the user to update, and 99.999% of all users will just auto-install the update, so the first and only thing anyone does with that "stable version" is update away from it
21:19:17 <strcat[m]> if they're concerned about stability they would support beta channels
21:19:23 <strcat[m]> anyway we'll have that for our own app update system
21:22:18 <mynacol[m]> They do have support for beta channels and use them (for fdroidclient)

21:52:38 <jay46> anyone have an idea if any of the Second Phone Number apps you can get from the aurora store, actually work on still in grapheneos?
21:57:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need pixel 4/4xl tester. Please pm me
22:11:13 <Jack8> I'm having a lot of issues getting notifications from just about every app. I put the apps on the "not optimized" list for the battery power saving but the notifications aren't coming.
22:12:02 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't put random apps as not battery optimized
22:12:04 <Jack8> 5 min after opening the app, it seems to go to sleep and no notifications come for some of them.
22:12:07 <strcat[m]> undo that
22:12:23 <strcat[m]> it only makes sense for an app that is designed to function in the background
22:12:38 <strcat[m]> Jack8: sounds like you're expecting apps without push notifications (or polling) to have it
22:12:44 <strcat[m]> Jack8: you can't ask the OS to implement a feature for an app
22:12:52 <strcat[m]> if they don't have push (or polling) they don't have it
22:13:00 <Jack8> The options are 1) I can fix notifications on GOS or 2) I have to uninstall GOS and go back to stock.
22:13:10 <strcat[m]> Jack8: there's nothing wrong with notifications on GrapheneOS
22:13:12 <strcat[m]> you're confused
22:13:15 <Jack8> The apps all worked before I switched to GOS
22:13:26 <Jack8> Can you help me then?
22:13:28 <strcat[m]> because the apps you're talking about probably used Google servers (FCM) for push
22:13:31 <strcat[m]> via Play services
22:13:46 <strcat[m]> and don't have another implementation of it like Signal, WhatsApp, etc. do
22:13:56 <strcat[m]> or at least, you haven't toggled it on, if they require a toggle for it
22:14:30 <Jack8> Some of them, the notifications work but only for a few minutes and then the app goes to sleep it seems
22:14:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> btw need some pixel 4/4xl testers
22:14:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> pm
22:14:54 <strcat[m]> Jack8: enabling battery optimization isn't magical, it won't give an app background push (or polling) that doesn't have it
22:15:01 <strcat[m]> Jack8: the app doesn't have the functionality you want
22:15:06 <Jack8> Yes it does
22:15:07 <strcat[m]> the OS can't do anything to provide it for the app
22:15:10 <Jack8> It worked before GOS
22:15:15 <strcat[m]> no, it doesn't
22:15:16 <strcat[m]> Jack8: again
22:15:19 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote in response
22:15:43 <Jack8> You wrote that the probably used FCM.
22:15:57 <strcat[m]> I explained that the apps likely use Play services to send notifications via Google servers
22:16:22 <strcat[m]> the app registers with FCM to listen for pushes, and their server sends the message to Google's FCM cloud
22:16:28 <Jack8> And I'm explaining to you that the apps do indeed have notifications that come through on GOS.
22:16:30 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS does not have Play services
22:16:34 <Jack8> And then they stop working
22:16:38 <Jack8> Are you listening?
22:16:42 <strcat[m]> Jack8: so, see what I explained above
22:16:43 <strcat[m]> yes
22:16:45 <strcat[m]> you aren't listening to me
22:17:12 <strcat[m]> when the app is in the foreground they likely establish a connection to their server since they need to talk to their server
22:17:15 <Lestat[m]> Ahem Jack8 u should chill
22:17:30 <strcat[m]> the apps you are talking about do not have an implementation of keeping that connection open when idle
22:17:39 <Jack8> I've bent over backwards and put in a great amount of effort to make GoS. Like I said, it took me a month or two to get to this point. I had to try 3 different Pixel 4 XL's before I got a good one. This isn't about me not listening.
22:17:40 <strcat[m]> the OS can't magically provide an implementation for them
22:17:49 <strcat[m]> it is you not listening
22:17:54 <strcat[m]> please read what I wrote above
22:18:18 <Jack8> If the app is the problem, how come they worked just fine on the stock Android?
22:18:24 <strcat[m]> this is not something uncommon or unexpected, it's fully expected that various apps from the Play Store are going to have some functionality depending on Play services which is not available
22:18:26 <strcat[m]> Jack8: explained above
22:18:27 <strcat[m]> read
22:18:27 <strcat[m]> thanks
22:18:40 <Lestat[m]> <Jack8 "If the app is the problem, how c"> Because stock android has google play services
22:18:47 <strcat[m]> stock Android has Play services, GrapheneOS does not and will not have it
22:18:53 <Jack8> But this app isnt using Google Play Services
22:19:04 <strcat[m]> what makes you say that?
22:19:08 <Lestat[m]> It probably is
22:19:12 <strcat[m]> please just read what I wrote above
22:19:20 <Jack8> Omg
22:19:20 <Lestat[m]> Most apps use play services for notifications
22:19:23 <Jack8> You're not listening
22:19:25 <Lestat[m]> Very few dont
22:19:25 <strcat[m]> you don't seem to like the answer so you're ignoring what I said and denying that it could be the case
22:19:38 <Jack8> The apps notifications work on Grapahene OS
22:19:39 <Jack8> Without google play services
22:19:46 <Jack8> But after 5 min, the stop.
22:19:50 <strcat[m]> Jack8: it's standard practice to open a connection to the app server when app is in use and use FCM to wake the app when idle
22:19:51 <strcat[m]> yeah
22:19:53 <strcat[m]> as I said above
22:20:10 <strcat[m]> that is totally normal because many apps do not bother to implement maintaining a background push connection when FCM is unavailable
22:20:13 <Jack8> Ok I'm sorry but the only option for me then is to get rid of GoS.
22:20:13 <strcat[m]> it's easy for them to do it
22:20:16 <strcat[m]> it's ~150 lines of code
22:20:22 <Jack8> I have to have this work. There is no other option for me.
22:20:23 <strcat[m]> Jack8: okay, do that then
22:20:34 <Lestat[m]> Well then u have to do that
22:20:43 <Lestat[m]> Install calyx if u need it
22:20:59 <Lestat[m]> Ok :(
22:21:15 <Jack8> What is Calyx?
22:21:16 <strcat[m]> if they need Google services work reliably they need to use the stock OS
22:21:19 <strcat[m]> please stop giving bad advice
22:21:33 <Jack8> Calyx is bad advice?
22:21:35 <strcat[m]> and don't promote or discuss projects making malicious attacks on GrapheneOS developers here
22:21:38 <strcat[m]> Jack8: yes, it's bad advice
22:21:42 <Lestat[m]> but microg has the push service implementation?
22:21:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> can i just get testers for 4/4xl?
22:21:48 <strcat[m]> Jack8: you need Google services to work reliably, so use stock, it is more secure and works reliably
22:21:54 <strcat[m]> Lestat: is insecure and does not work reliably
22:21:56 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "and don't promote or discuss pro"> Oh theyre doing that
22:22:00 <Lestat[m]> shit i didnt know
22:23:10 <strcat[m]> microG is only an implementation of a small subset of Play services, and FCM push does not work reliably, which is what they are saying they need
22:23:26 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "microG is only an implementation"> Okay sorry then
22:23:30 <strcat[m]> and it's a less secure implementation, it's missing important key pinning for TLS and local components
22:23:32 <strcat[m]> among other problems
22:23:43 <Lestat[m]> Good to know
22:23:47 <zzxx123_> Calyx attacks GOS seriously?
22:23:56 <strcat[m]> zzxx123_: yes and please drop it
22:23:59 <strcat[m]> I already said not to talk about it here
22:24:03 <Lestat[m]> <zzxx123_ "Calyx attacks GOS seriously?"> news to me too
22:24:05 <strcat[m]> bans coming for people who continue
22:24:06 <zzxx123_> ok

22:42:05 <strcat[m]>  * per https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/24#issuecomment-792069571 supplementary location providers do not appear to have much real world use beyond getting a super inaccurate ~1km coarse location
22:42:36 <strcat[m]> GNSS is already very good especially when you're connected to a mobile network with a carrier providing a good SUPL implementation
22:42:54 <strcat[m]> think we can safely cancel this
22:58:22 <Jack8> strcat[m] are you the lead developer?
23:00:27 <Lestat[m]> Strcat is Daniel
23:00:37 <Lestat[m]> Found this out today :P
23:01:00 <Jack8> Sorry idk who Daniel is
23:01:12 <Lestat[m]> Daniel Micay
23:01:21 <Jack8> Lead developer
23:01:25 <Jack8> Got it
23:05:48 <qieko[m]> by the way how long does my pin need to be for security? it is unclear to me because of 'weaver'
23:06:55 <ulmirdin[m]> 4 digit pin will be sufficient.
23:08:02 <ulmirdin[m]> It will be easier to hit you in the head with a stick until you tell your pin than brute force it.
23:08:12 <strcat[m]> qieko: if you want to rely on the secure element, a *random* 6 digit PIN is fine
23:08:38 <ulmirdin[m]> All depends on your thread model
23:08:41 <strcat[m]> not much point in using something between that and a strong passphrase, if you want to avoid depending on the secure element, you need a strong passphrase
23:09:23 <strcat[m]> so, for example, a random 12 digit PIN still depends entirely on the secure element to be secure
23:09:46 <pinkylittlecat[m> hm what happens if the "optimizing battery usage" setting is turned off for those apps that are not showing notifications?
23:10:13 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: won't change anything for most apps
23:10:17 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it only makes a difference if the app actually attempts to run a background connection or do polling in the background
23:10:29 <qieko[m]> okay thank you, is it similar to LUKS if not using the secure element
23:10:32 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: and most of those apps should know how to request the battery optimization exception from you if they need it
23:10:46 <strcat[m]> qieko: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:10:54 <strcat[m]> and you're always using the secure element and other hardware support
23:11:08 <strcat[m]> I'm simply saying that if you don't want to depend on that, you need a strong passphrase
23:11:29 <strcat[m]> best thing you can do is read the detailed section in the documentation
23:11:51 <qieko[m]> i meant the entropy calculation
23:12:03 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading that section first
23:12:15 <qieko[m]> ahh will reread thank you
23:12:31 <pinkylittlecat[m> i cant reliably test it
23:13:05 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so, for example, Signal keeps open a background connection, and it pings it at an interval (an overly aggressive / inflexible interval, so it's not very efficient) to keep it alive
23:13:20 <Kizzlecake> not sure if this is a good spot for this question but is there something that can work in place of android auto on GrapheneOS?
23:13:29 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: in order to avoid it not working during idle states, it asks for a battery optimization exception
23:13:48 <strcat[m]> Kizzlecake: Bluetooth audio + use UI on the phone with a stand?
23:14:13 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: so, that's one example (push) which also applies to an email client using IMAP IDLE (push)
23:14:34 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: crappier apps may do polling at some interval instead of having push to get the notification right away
23:14:57 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: either way, they should be asking for battery optimization exception if they need it and the user can decide if they want to give it to the app
23:15:15 <Kizzlecake> strcat:  looking for something that works with GM infotainment/radio. Not sure if one exists
23:15:55 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: if an app is not designed to either support push (maintaining a connection to the server) or polling in the background then battery optimization exception isn't going to be any use for it
23:16:05 <strcat[m]> Kizzlecake: Bluetooth audio probably works fine
23:16:12 <strcat[m]> I assume they support that
23:16:42 <strcat[m]> buy a stand for the phone and control it via the phone
23:18:10 <Kizzlecake> strcat: would like to have the phones navigation and music etc on the car's touchscreen
23:18:22 <Kizzlecake> hope that makes sense
23:18:40 <strcat[m]> I don't think there's an implementation of that available

23:20:24 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: battery optimization just won't make any difference for most apps
23:20:38 * pinkylittlecat[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xzaOXMYUcmuLqHcLDIIHXyaI/message.txt >
23:21:16 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it does 2 main things: A) the app can use the network when the phone is in idle states rather than only in specific maintenance windows for periodic jobs requiring network access, B) the app can use fine-grained, more precise alarms to wake itself during app / device idle states
23:21:31 <pinkylittlecat[m> so.. maybe tell people to disable battery optmization in order to fix the unreliable notifications?
23:21:41 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: no
23:21:42 <strcat[m]> it won't help
23:22:28 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: if the app doesn't implement their own push or polling, it doesn't accomplish anything to give it more lenient rules for their push/polling
23:22:43 <strcat[m]> and if it does implement push/polling itself then chances are it knows how to request the exception
23:22:46 <strcat[m]> like Signal does

23:23:24 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: for WhatsApp, it has a toggle (at least in the non-Play-Store version) to toggle on a background connection rather than only keeping the connection open in the foreground
23:23:36 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: and then you can give it a battery optimization exception to make that work in idle states
23:23:58 <strcat[m]> but for most apps, if they support it, they'll do it automatically when Play isn't available
23:24:01 <strcat[m]> and they'll ask for the exception
23:24:37 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: if the apps only connects to their server in the foreground and relies on Play services to wake it when idle, a battery optimization exception won't make any difference, it simply doesn't know how to do idle push notifications another way
23:24:58 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: some apps may even rely on it even more than that and use it in the foreground too
23:26:08 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: this is something that has to be implemented by app devs, and people need to talk to them, not us
23:26:18 <strcat[m]> people are reporting it and asking for help in the wrong place
23:27:56 <Jack8> FWIW I sent an email to Schlage about their SchlageHome app.
23:28:03 <Jack8> This is their response:
23:28:03 <Jack8> "Good Afternoon,
23:28:04 <Jack8> Thank you for reaching out to Schlage Support! I would be happy to assist. However there is no way to implement an alternative to Google FCM. I do apologize for any frustration or inconveniences this may have caused."
23:28:24 <strcat[m]> that's completely inaccurate
23:28:50 <strcat[m]> I suggest sending more emails and linking to Signal and WhatsApp as examples of apps supporting keeping open a background connection
23:29:07 <strcat[m]> anyway the app developers are the right people to report it to
23:29:09 <Jack8> Ok I'll keep that in mind for next time
23:29:13 <strcat[m]> if they don't want to do it, they don't want to do it
23:29:42 <strcat[m]> app developers love making up inaccurate excuses for why they require unnecessary permissions, access and why they have dependencies on Google services
23:29:52 <strcat[m]>  * app developers love making up inaccurate excuses for why they require unnecessary permissions, access and why they have hard dependencies on Google services
23:31:00 <strcat[m]> an app can do exactly the same thing that FCM does itself
23:31:29 <strcat[m]> the only extra thing it needs to do is run a foreground service for reliability
23:33:02 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Speaking as an Android developer this is accurate
23:34:07 <strcat[m]> oh and apps distributed only outside the Play store (a lot of those apps people like from F-Droid) tend to do things that are completely inappropriate and disallowed for Play Store apps
23:34:19 <strcat[m]> and users just accept it without caring about lack of respect for user consent / privacy
23:35:24 <strcat[m]> Play Store requires targeting API 29+ or you can't release the app or a new version of the app through it
23:35:48 <strcat[m]> most of the changes required to target newer API levels, especially the major changes, are privacy/security improvements
23:36:10 <strcat[m]> F-Droid has no expectation that apps target modern API level and does not do that itself
23:36:27 <strcat[m]> people just assume that an open source app cares about privacy/security or even prioritizes it just because devs pay lip service to it
23:38:18 <strcat[m]> any new app or app update on Play Store targets API 29+ (i.e. Android 10+ privacy/security improvements)
23:39:03 <strcat[m]> F-Droid itself targets API 25 (Android 7.1+ privacy/security improvements) and of course a lot of apps being added/updated in it are worse
23:39:23 <strcat[m]> we'd like to actually set a hard limit of 28+ at some point
23:39:35 <strcat[m]> and the problem is not proprietary apps but rather ones like that
23:40:04 <strcat[m]> just one symptom of not actually prioritizing privacy/security btw
23:40:28 <strcat[m]> and it really is all about priorities, not lack of resources
23:41:00 <strcat[m]> when the Play Store forces you to do something, that becomes your #1 priority obviously, since you can't release the app without doing it... and it's not like the Play Store has strict standards or review but at least they do this 1 thing
23:41:26 <strcat[m]> adopting privacy/security improvements/restrictions within 1 year after their release is... not a high expectation
23:41:52 <strcat[m]> and it's not even usually that strict, there are multi-year, multi-API level deprecations/removals of stuff
23:41:56 <strcat[m]> for the more major cases
23:42:18 <strcat[m]> so for example Android 7 added the more secure v2 signatures and Android 11 disallowed not using v2+ for apps targeting the new API level (30+)
23:42:44 <strcat[m]> i.e. you had over 4 years to adopt it (because it was available before Android 7 was released in the preview releases)
23:42:57 <strcat[m]> and then an extra year to adopt API 30+
23:44:05 <strcat[m]> anyway F-Droid kept using v1 signatures despite this being a substantial security improvement, and they even kept using them for API 30+ apps, which was broken, and people saw it was broken on the Android 11 previews, but nothing was done for months, and then weeks more after the stable release
23:44:32 <strcat[m]> so when stock OS, GrapheneOS and other users updated to Android 11, these broken apps from F-Droid became unavailable since API 30+ forbids v1 signatures
23:44:34 <strcat[m]> people may remember that
23:45:09 <strcat[m]> but it's worse than people probably realize: the security improvement was from 2016, not 2020
23:45:28 <strcat[m]> Android 7 released as stable in August 2016 and had previews with this months earlier, SDK supported it long before the stable release
23:45:34 <strcat[m]> v2 is backwards compatible
23:45:38 <strcat[m]> (as is v3, etc.)
23:46:22 <strcat[m]> current signatures are v4: https://source.android.com/security/apksigning/v4 and support extending verified boot to apps for a first party app source
23:47:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> verified boot for first party apps is very cool
23:53:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> hypokeimenon🖤‍❤️🏳️‍🌈: it's not really verified boot
23:53:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> they use it to quickly install large apps
23:54:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> all apps technically already have verified boot
23:54:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> the signature is checked
