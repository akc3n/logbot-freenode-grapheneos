00:03:27 <rny> hi whatever
00:05:32 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> strcat ty didnt know
01:10:53 <thegameisrigged> Hi, i have a question about users profile
01:12:09 <thegameisrigged> If I understand correctly the user profile work as a compartment, so is like "qubeos"? more or less
01:12:41 <dazinism> thegameisrigged: kind of yeah
01:13:15 <noobexterminator> When will GrapheneOS stop updating the Pixel 3?
01:13:23 <rny> when google stops
01:13:31 <thegameisrigged> Can i have more profiles? And do a really good Compartmentalization?
01:13:43 <noobexterminator> smart man
01:15:33 <dazinism> thegameisrigged: you can have a fair few (16 maybe?)
01:16:24 <dazinism> Unlike QubesOS you can only have one user profile active on the display at a time
01:17:15 <dazinism> Also you only get notifications when you are in a user profile
01:17:32 <dazinism> Theres some info here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
01:22:32 <thegameisrigged> Thanks, ill read, but if one of them is compromized, the other are still good like in qubes?
01:28:53 <thegameisrigged> I Have to go, if somone can answer my last question thanks a lot, i will read it later in the public log.
01:43:29 <dazinism> thegameisrigged: its not really like that. Android is significantly harder to exploit than the linux appVMs running in QubesOS
01:43:59 <dazinism> Graphene harder still
01:47:47 <noobexterminator> Guys if i want a pixel 3 a Xl running GrapheneOs does the phone need to be Factory Unlocked?
01:50:51 <jameshandcockand> Yep
02:11:27 <strcat[m]> noobexterminator3000: strongly recommend against getting a Pixel 3 at this point
02:11:28 <strcat[m]> get a 4a
02:11:37 <strcat[m]> read the information on the site before buying a device
02:13:43 <dummy> Hello, good day.
02:14:05 <Guest26236> hello
02:15:00 <Guest26236> here is a low and dirty. verizon pixel3. greyed out oem unlocking. fastboot cant unlock, flash etc. anyway around it?
02:15:20 <Guest26236> USB debug on, developer mode on
02:15:33 <Guest26236> host is linux running pop
02:17:19 <dazinism> Guest26236: most likely not possible. Could try giving the phone internet access which can help
02:18:40 <Guest26236> tried that, but oem is still greyed out
02:18:44 <dazinism> If its a proper Verizon device. Rather than a generic phone with a Verizon Sim I don't think its possible
02:19:12 <Guest26236> its actually has been purchased from google. it came with verizon sim(reasons)
02:19:25 <Guest26236> it is unlocked for another sims(tried)
02:20:47 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: SmartSelect_20210121-202014_eBay.jpg (118KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YWFGGOKRqhOXuXCSYDJOsraJ/SmartSelect_20210121-202014_eBay.jpg >
02:21:03 <noobexterminator> Should that be able to run GrapheneOs?
02:22:16 <Guest26236> not sure what your question is... that phone is listed on grapheneOS website as supported.
02:22:41 <Guest26236> issue I am having is that i cant get into bootloader since i cant put my finger on how exactly it was locked
02:23:16 <Guest26236> since technically its android programming for oem locking, but i am going one level below and technically should be able to unlock flashing of it
02:23:16 <noobexterminator> No, like im asking if theres anything wrong with the Title
02:23:42 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000:  sure it can . assuming that by network unlocked they mean carrier unlocked
02:23:58 <noobexterminator> Yesssirrr
02:23:59 <Guest26236> GrapheneOS has official production support for the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a.
02:24:15 <noobexterminator> I will buy it tommorrow
02:24:27 <take_a_deep_brea> although you do realise that device will only be supported for a little more than a year
02:24:32 <take_a_deep_brea> right?
02:24:43 <noobexterminator> I got a s9+ rn
02:24:50 <noobexterminator> It also ends in 2022
02:24:51 <Guest26236> what do you mean by that?
02:24:56 <Guest26236> that the build is raw?
02:25:46 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000:  i meant pixel 3a only gets updates and new versions till next year march or something
02:26:02 <louipc> yea the manufacturer will stop updating it
02:26:02 <noobexterminator> S9+ is so good but my phone has so much bloatware and bixby vision and bixby that and more samsung bloatware
02:26:29 <louipc> then when new bugs are discovered it will be more and more likely that your phone can be cracked
02:26:40 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: i understand that. i am talking about the pixel here buddy
02:27:06 <noobexterminator> I know that updates will stop on 2022 on the pixel 3 a
02:27:12 <louipc> noobexterminator: lol i guess pixel will be better than that
02:27:20 <noobexterminator> Yeah
02:27:22 <take_a_deep_brea> i have a samsung phone too. an absolute pain to look at.
02:27:22 <louipc> samsung
02:27:29 <louipc> lol
02:28:26 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: any particular reason you dont prefer 4a ? mind sharing with us ?
02:29:33 <noobexterminator> I only got $300 and im 15
02:30:10 <louipc> nice
02:30:34 <noobexterminator> I dont want to waste all of my money cuz my mom gonna get mad that i wasted all of it on a phone and i already got a phone so she dosent understand
02:30:34 <Guest26236> ok, back the question
02:31:16 <Guest26236> no one knows of anyway of unlcoking bootloader
02:31:29 <louipc> Guest26236: use fastboot
02:31:43 <Guest26236> fastboot dont
02:31:44 <Guest26236> work
02:31:53 <Guest26236> give FAILED command
02:31:55 <noobexterminator> Have you tried googling it
02:32:00 <louipc> are you trying to install grapheneos?
02:32:08 <Guest26236> yes, yes
02:32:13 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: its great that you came to know of graphene this early.
02:32:38 <louipc> you need the correct version of fastboot too
02:32:48 <louipc> also boot into bootloader
02:33:07 <technoph0bian[m]> <Guest26236 "it is unlocked for another sims("> I'm very confused. Is it permanently locked because you put a verizon sim in it or does it still work with other sims?
02:33:13 <louipc> and make sure the computer can see the device
02:33:32 <louipc> all the instructions are here https://grapheneos.org/install
02:33:34 <Guest26236> it still works with other sims
02:33:48 <louipc> please read them and follow carefully
02:34:04 <Guest26236> louipc, I dont mean to insult anyones intelligence but i can read install guides
02:34:20 <Guest26236> this is an unanswered google issue
02:34:36 <Guest26236> no one clearly knows where the lock is
02:34:54 <Guest26236> so i was going to the source on this chat to see if anyone has dealt with this
02:35:24 <Guest26236> and yes i do have correct fastboot
02:35:28 <technoph0bian[m]> <louipc "also boot into bootloader"> I think he said oem unlocking in dev options is greyed out
02:35:39 <Guest26236> correct
02:35:51 <louipc> ohok.. a lot of people have problems from not following properly. so just covering that
02:36:29 <noobexterminator> Im just going to follow the hated ones install guide becuase it feels easier
02:36:30 <Guest26236> its not my first ROM. its my first ROM on this specific pixel3
02:37:22 <technoph0bian[m]> Why can't you use the other sim to unlock it, install graphene and put the old sim back in?
02:37:48 <Guest26236> tried...
02:37:51 <Guest26236> same greyed out bs
02:37:58 <Guest26236> tried without sim just on wifi
02:38:01 <TheJollyRoger> Guest26236: once the phone is booted, connect to it with android debug bridge and run "adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid". Tell me what the answer is.
02:38:11 <Guest26236> tried reset to factory not even install load to bootloader
02:38:16 <noobexterminator> Well, Goodluck Guest26236
02:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> If it's 0000001, which I strongly believe it will be, than there's nothing we can do: that carrier ID is set in the read only partition. Unless you have a multimillion dollar chip forensics device or an android zero day I wouldn't count on it.
02:39:26 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000: its up to you what guide you follow. but remember that only the official guide is supported . and so as much as.we try to help you out with you flashing with instructions from youtube we can only help you to a limited extent in case you do get stuck while flashing
02:39:46 <Guest26236> adb server version (39) doesn't match this client (41); killing...
02:39:47 <Guest26236> * daemon started successfully
02:39:47 <Guest26236> adb: no devices/emulators found
02:40:15 <noobexterminator> <take_a_deep_brea "noobexterminator3000: its up to "> Thanks dudeüëç
02:40:22 <Pratyush[m]> Are you running adb as root or not ?
02:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> Guest26236: usb debugging needs to be on and the phone must be set to trust your computer's RSA fingerprint.
02:40:35 <Guest26236> shit hold on
02:40:39 <TheJollyRoger> You also need udev rules to properly allow adb to communicate through udev.
02:40:59 <TheJollyRoger> Or to run adb as root (not recommended, but it's your computer)
02:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> If the result is anything but "0000000" then you're not going to be unlocking that phone.
02:41:42 <Guest26236> i had the same thing with rsa trust
02:42:16 <Pratyush[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You also need udev rules to prop"> For me it's easy to install and configure udev rule but everyone don't like it so i go with root options for other.
02:42:16 <TheJollyRoger> gotta go.
02:42:20 <Guest26236> let me try it
02:42:22 <Guest26236> thnx
02:43:05 <Guest26236> let me fix my adb
02:43:26 <Guest26236> its not seeing the phone after this factory reset
02:45:13 <TheJollyRoger> The carrier ID is permanently set, so it's burned into the chip. Short of lasering the chip open, filling the E-fuse, and then resealing it (life expectancy of the chip will be reduced to seconds immediately afterwards). You could either find or buy a full privilege Android zero day if that's the case and you have roughly $300,000.
02:45:42 <TheJollyRoger> *$30,000 to $300,000.
02:45:50 <Pratyush[m]> <Guest26236 "its not seeing the phone after t"> If you rested you phone you need to turn on dev option and usb debugging again
02:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, now I really need to go. See you guys.
02:46:51 <take_a_deep_brea> see yaTheJollyRoger !
03:04:15 <eggs72> I'm having issues enabling OEM unlocking on a new carrier-unlocked pixel 4a
03:04:58 <eggs72> I've got it connected to wifi and the cell network but the option in developer options is still greyed out
03:05:14 <eggs72> Has anyone seen this happen?
03:05:58 <deappledapple> <eggs72 "I'm having issues enabling OEM u"> Yeah, carrier-unlocked does not mean bootloader unlockable
03:06:35 <deappledapple> There's a way to determine this
03:06:41 <deappledapple> Let me grab that on the logbot for a sec
03:07:13 <eggs72> I just bought it off amazon supposedly from the google store, is there a different source you're supposed to order from?
03:07:42 <deappledapple> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210122#c6615862
03:09:12 <deappledapple> <eggs72 "I just bought it off amazon supp"> amazon does not ensure the authenticity of the package delivered unfortunately
03:09:38 <eggs72> adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid returns 00000000
03:10:01 <deappledapple> Oh it's unlockable
03:10:08 <deappledapple> Perhaps try updating your OS
03:10:42 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Perhaps try updating your OS"> The stock OS
03:11:38 <eggs72> Alright, there's an update to android 11 in the system update menu so I'll try that
03:56:43 <b1101> didn't know there was a command way to determine whether a phone is bootloader unlockable. I asked sellers if the phones imei started with 99, as those were from google
03:56:53 <b1101> for pixel 3 anyway
03:58:03 <eggs72> Updating the 4a didn't work by itself, but after doing that and a factory reset I can unlock the bootloader now, thanks
04:05:17 <awwadd> Hey there everybody. I am currently looking for a little help, or rather, clarification about GrapheneOS and the installation process. Am I able to ask this here?
04:05:36 <somenerd[m]> you can ask this here
04:08:10 <awwadd> Ok great. I have recently completed the installation process for my Pixel 4, and all seemed to work fine. The only problem now is that the installation has completed, however my phone is reading out 'Can't find valid operating system¬† - The Device will not start'. I have tried recovery mode, rescue mode and a range of others, but nothing seems to
04:08:11 <awwadd> budge it from it's current state.
04:08:29 <josh[m]1> eggs72 did it actually work or just appear to?
04:08:41 <awwadd> I believe something went wrong during the actual flashing of the Flame Factory image onto the phone.
04:08:45 <awwadd> No, I don't believe it worked.
04:08:59 <awwadd> There were lots of
04:08:59 <awwadd> XXXX [Failed]
04:09:00 <awwadd> YYYY[Failed]
04:09:10 <josh[m]1> I ask because I had a pixel2 "replaced" by Google and they sent me a Verizon bootloader-locked phone and it acted like it worked but didn't really
04:09:56 <awwadd> Oh, interesting. Well it's a bit of a bother. I'm starting to fret that I've paperweighted the Pixel here.
04:10:39 <awwadd> The fastboot mode is still unlocked, however I can't seem to actually flash the device with Graphene Correctly.
04:10:45 <awwadd> Or at least, It doesn't want to work.
04:13:10 <technoph0bian[m]> <josh[m]1 "I ask because I had a pixel2 "re"> Theirs was carrier unlocked but for some reason had oem unlocking greyed out from what i've seen.
04:14:12 <technoph0bian[m]> awwadd: are you using a high quality usb-c cable?
04:14:55 <awwadd> technoph0bian[m] Yes, I believe so. I just bought it yesterday. Thought it is long [ 3 meters ]
04:14:57 <awwadd> though*
04:15:36 <eggs72> josh[m]1: The unlock worked, I just finished installing
04:17:33 <technoph0bian[m]> What os are you flashing from?
04:18:19 <technoph0bian[m]> Yesterday someone was having a problem flashing from Linux
04:20:41 <eggs72> fwiw I just flashed the 4a from Ubuntu 20.04 without issues after getting the unlock figured out
04:22:22 <technoph0bian[m]> Recent kernels are usually fine, but this person was able to flash fine after trying from Windows
04:23:58 <awwadd> Windows 10
04:24:30 <awwadd> I tried to flash on my laptop with Ubuntu, but it wouldn't recognize my pixel.
04:25:58 <b1101> awwadd: permission issue possibly? did you try as root?
04:26:20 <awwadd> Yes sir I did. But my laptop doesn't appear to find my device at all.
04:27:16 <b1101> :/
04:27:39 <technoph0bian[m]> If Windows drivers are up to date, then i would say try a different usb-c cable if available.
04:28:51 <awwadd> So, initially, the flash-all.sh command was not working at all. However I read a fix that was to open up the flash-all code in sublime text, and remove everything above and below a certain point. Once I did that, the installation began to run, but as it turns out, it failed.
04:32:28 <technoph0bian[m]> Where did you get this fix?
04:32:56 <technoph0bian[m]> Does flashing stock firmware work?
04:33:04 <awwadd> Techlore's youtube page on troubleshooting. Around the 5 minute mark.
04:33:04 <awwadd> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG6x4q1Ugz0&t=304s
04:33:26 <TheJollyRoger> awwadd: you just came close to bricking your pixel.
04:33:47 <awwadd> Oh dear..
04:33:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
04:33:58 <awwadd> Can this be.. remedied, by any chance?
04:34:26 <TheJollyRoger> That safety check there is to stop flashing from going ahead if the script detects something's amiss.
04:34:37 <rny> lol
04:34:52 <TheJollyRoger> You're lucky that your phone had the correct slot selected, otherwise you would've found out what a corrupted install would have looked like in a hurry. This wasn't an "oh it worked" - you just got lucky that this time the stars aligned.
04:35:25 <awwadd> Good lord. After the 2020 I had, a bricked Pixel would have broken me.
04:35:27 <rny> i dont think it'd brick
04:35:28 <TheJollyRoger> Please don't remove that safety check or advise others to, that's playing with fire.
04:35:35 <rny> it would just stuck in reboot loop
04:35:35 <TheJollyRoger> It wouldn't brick permanently, but it would be unbootable.
04:35:42 <rny> and boots back to fastboot mode
04:35:49 <awwadd> Ok, ten-four, good advice and I'll be sure to fix.
04:35:54 <awwadd> Pass on to others*
04:36:03 <rny> i still dont know how to brick the phone to this day
04:36:18 <awwadd> Are any of you fine people able to possibly walk me back through how to get it back to square 1, at least, even to stock android?
04:36:48 <awwadd> It current can't get out of Fastboot mode [unlocked].
04:37:00 <TheJollyRoger> awwadd: sure. The easiest way to get back to "factory fresh" condition is to use Google's online flash tool, at https://flash.android.com .
04:37:46 <awwadd> Ahh! So! I tried to use this last night, however it couldn't 'find' my phone either.
04:37:59 <TheJollyRoger> awwadd: I unfortunately can't be here for a talk-down at this moment though, sorry. I have to get rolling again >_<.
04:38:18 <awwadd> Heart breaking!
04:38:36 <rny> awwadd: on linux
04:38:39 <rny> ?
04:38:42 <awwadd> Windows 10
04:38:50 <rny> sorry, dont know how to help
04:38:53 <awwadd> Tried on Linux, but the Laptop wouldn't recognize the phone.
04:38:55 <technoph0bian[m]> Did you get the out of date fastboot error mentioned in the techlore video?
04:41:09 <awwadd> Actually yes, yes I did.
04:42:09 <awwadd> But when I tried to click fastboot or flash-all or anything like that, the command wouldn't stay open.
04:43:16 <technoph0bian[m]> I haven't encountered this error, but definitely try going back to stock so you have a usable device for now
04:43:45 <technoph0bian[m]> https://developers.google.com/android/images
04:43:45 <technoph0bian[m]> Instructions are here
04:43:48 <awwadd> Interesting!
04:43:48 <awwadd> I will try my hardest to get my phone back to stock.
04:44:04 <strcat[m]> installing stock is not any easier than installing GrapheneOS
04:44:08 <strcat[m]> and DO NOT use any techlore videos
04:44:35 <awwadd> Rats. Too late I learn that Techlore is not the guide to follow.
04:44:39 <somenerd[m]> yeah please don't use them
04:44:46 <somenerd[m]> they're recommended against
04:44:50 <awwadd> Rats.
04:45:00 <strcat[m]> his videos are inaccurate but I doubt he'll update them or take them down since he's malicious towards the project now
04:45:10 <strcat[m]> causes people to brick their devices
04:45:11 <strcat[m]> and mess up their OS
04:45:20 <strcat[m]> getting some sketchy third party fastboot iirc
04:45:25 <strcat[m]> oh well
04:45:29 <strcat[m]> the official guide says not to do it
04:45:39 <technoph0bian[m]> Are you sure you are using up to date fastboot?
04:45:57 <technoph0bian[m]> <strcat[m] "his videos are inaccurate but I "> ?
04:46:00 <somenerd[m]> > his videos are inaccurate but I doubt he'll update them or take them down since he's malicious towards the project now
04:46:00 <somenerd[m]> I guess ask him ig
04:46:08 <somenerd[m]> cuz I believe he is in good faith
04:46:08 <awwadd> I just downloaded fastboot again from the SDK Platform tools. Is that about right?
04:46:15 <strcat[m]> no
04:46:17 <somenerd[m]> but incredibly misleading
04:46:19 <strcat[m]> follow the official guide
04:46:28 <strcat[m]> do not download, install, extract, etc. anything on your own
04:46:39 <strcat[m]> remove whatever you previously downloaded/installed
04:46:50 <technoph0bian[m]> Yeah he is definetly in good faith
04:47:02 <strcat[m]> at the time, not anymore
04:47:04 <strcat[m]> he's malicious
04:47:07 <somenerd[m]> I wouldn't be too sure about that
04:47:13 <awwadd> Ok, strcat[m], I've deleted everything.
04:47:15 <somenerd[m]> > Yeah he is definetly in good faith
04:47:20 <somenerd[m]> this one btw
04:47:27 <awwadd> I tried to follow theoficial guide. But it seemed slightly more geared towards Linux than W10 for me.
04:47:31 <somenerd[m]>  * replying to this
04:47:35 <strcat[m]> it isn';t
04:47:38 <strcat[m]>  * it isn't
04:47:46 <strcat[m]> it has exactly the same support for Linux, Windows and macOS
04:48:12 <strcat[m]>  * it has exactly the same support for Arch Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Windows and macOS
04:48:22 <strcat[m]> it works on all of them copying the commands
04:48:23 <awwadd> Alrighty, ten-four, I'll have another go, sir.
04:49:18 <strcat[m]> Debian and Ubuntu don't have a proper package for fastboot so it's not any easier
04:49:37 <technoph0bian[m]> Btw, just because he made a video comparing speeds that you didn't agree with doesn't make him malicious
04:49:54 <eagle> used live pop os to do the flash
04:50:14 <strcat[m]> technoph0bian: that isn't what he did in that video
04:50:19 <strcat[m]> technoph0bian: and he is malicious
04:50:24 <strcat[m]> he's a dishonest, manipulative scumbag
04:50:44 <technoph0bian[m]> Please explain
04:50:49 <somenerd[m]> that's not the problem
04:50:54 <somenerd[m]> he spins things
04:50:57 <strcat[m]> he's a dishonest bully who has personally targeted me\
04:51:03 <strcat[m]> and directed harassment towards me
04:51:04 <somenerd[m]> makes GrapheneOS seem non user friendly
04:51:17 <somenerd[m]> and the stupid dr.frankenstein joke
04:51:19 <strcat[m]> and I will just ban you from the channel for supporting someone spreading misinformation, manipulating things and harassing me
04:51:22 <strcat[m]> it is not up for debate
04:51:36 <strcat[m]>  * he's a dishonest bully who has personally targeted me
04:51:45 <strcat[m]> if you support someone who harasses me and pushes misinformation maliciously
04:51:52 <strcat[m]> you're not welcome in the GrapheneOS community
04:51:55 <technoph0bian[m]> That doesn't seem like something he would do, but ok
04:53:20 <somenerd[m]> I can see why he's malicious
04:53:28 <somenerd[m]> he could've added a bit of nuance
04:53:31 <somenerd[m]> and fixed things
04:53:32 <somenerd[m]> but nope
04:53:35 <strcat[m]> not about lack of nuance
04:53:45 <strcat[m]> it's about deliberately spreading misinformation, directing people to harass me
04:54:02 <eagle> thank for the feedback
04:54:05 <eagle> about techlor
04:54:05 <strcat[m]> anyone trying to support him will be permanently banned from the GrapheneOS community, same goes for supporting anyone harassing any of the others developers etc.
04:54:14 <eagle> me as a non tech
04:54:32 <eagle> i thought he is good now i will stop watcahing his videos
04:54:42 <eagle> may i ask about some trust channels
04:54:57 <strcat[m]> just a youtube influencer making up BS and causing drama to get subscribers
04:54:59 <eagle> trusted*
04:55:08 <strcat[m]> but he went particularly far with what he did to this project
04:55:20 <strcat[m]> and has caused substantial harm and directed substantial harassment towards me
04:55:27 <eagle> so i can keep self educating about security and privacy
04:55:29 <strcat[m]> and he doubled down on it rather than doing anything to correct it
04:55:46 <strcat[m]> you're not educating yourself by watching videos from those kinds of people
04:55:56 <eagle> i agree
04:56:04 <eagle> but since i don't know any better
04:56:24 <strcat[m]> youtube is in general a bad source of information
04:56:41 <eagle> still verifying the sources on the go
04:57:26 <eagle> i'm more of audio visual learner but flexiable enough to learn other ways and try always to find new sources
04:58:37 <eagle> now i just deleted that guy i don't like manipulative people specially if they took advantage of people like me who are literate and they pretend to educate me
05:02:18 <strcat[m]> he knows his old GrapheneOS videos are inaccurate and cause people to brick their devices
05:02:22 <strcat[m]> they never followed the official instructions
05:02:27 <strcat[m]> they're far worse now
05:03:05 <strcat[m]> eagle: he has repeatedly personally targeted me with attacks / conspiracy theories and has directed substantial harassment towards me
05:03:34 <strcat[m]> and he deliberately posted very misleading content about GrapheneOS out of spite
05:03:56 <strcat[m]> aside from that it's simply a consistently bad source of technical information
05:04:19 <strcat[m]> and you aren't well served getting info from someone who bases his videos around who spends time flattering him and helping promote his channel
05:04:29 <eagle> i feel so bad knowing how fooled i was
05:05:00 <strcat[m]> youtube influencers are generally a bad source of info
05:05:37 <eagle> that's why i'm so happy with configured system like Graphene
05:06:02 <eagle> a system my lack of knowledge wouldn't affect how it works
05:06:13 <strcat[m]> I reached out to him privately before talking about any of this publicly asking him to stop what he was doing and he didn't
05:06:20 <awwadd> Hey strcat[m] I just finished the installation process again, this time following the guide perfectly, and using Powershell commands and such. It all installed fine, and everything seemed perfect, however the phone rebooted a few times and now has an image of the Android Robot with a red '!' coming from his tummy. My powershell is left on < waiting
05:06:21 <awwadd> for any device >
05:06:23 <strcat[m]> just ignored me, said nothing in response to a bunch of stuff I wrote
05:06:46 <somenerd[m]> he makes you seem like you're crazy for some reason (afaict)
05:06:54 <somenerd[m]> even though the effects say otherwise
05:07:36 <awwadd> My phone simly reads 'No Command' underneath the image of the robot.
05:07:41 <awwadd> simply*
05:07:44 <strcat[m]> awwadd: that's recovery mode
05:07:53 <strcat[m]> maybe you interrupted the install process early
05:07:56 <strcat[m]> turn it off and do it again
05:08:28 <strcat[m]> make sure to read what it says about USB
05:08:33 <strcat[m]> and don't interrupt the process early
05:08:38 <strcat[m]> it sounds like that might be what you did
05:10:05 <awwadd> Hmm alright, which part of the USB reference are you refering to?
05:10:05 <awwadd> I'm not sure what I would have done to interrupt it.
05:10:36 <awwadd> The last thing my powershell did was
05:10:37 <awwadd> 'Extracting super_empty.img (0 MB) to disk ...
05:10:54 <awwadd> Could it be that my brand new, 3 meter long USB C to USB A cable to unfit for purpose?
05:12:02 <awwadd> Now it says,
05:12:03 <awwadd> 'fastboot: error: failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one of more components might be unbootable.'
05:16:38 <strcat[m]> sounds like the installation process isn't completing
05:16:43 <strcat[m]> USB cable is probably faulty
05:16:55 <strcat[m]> most USB A to USB C cables are faulty / non-spec-compliant
05:16:57 <strcat[m]> lose data
05:17:04 <strcat[m]> fastboot protocol can't handle it
05:17:11 <strcat[m]> it expects a working connection
05:17:37 <strcat[m]> the install guide has information on USB cables / ports
05:17:56 <awwadd> I see I see, well that'd a darn shame. Thanks for all of your help. I'll kep trying.
05:18:45 <M0n30v3rb04rd[m]> Try a dif USB Port
05:19:26 <awwadd> Oh hey wow, it just booted to Graphene.
05:19:30 <awwadd> From that Android little robot window.
05:19:34 <awwadd> I just re-tryed and it came through?
05:19:58 <awwadd> I WONT question it..
05:20:24 <strcat[m]> awwadd: did you lock the bootloader?
05:20:27 <strcat[m]> make sure it's locked
05:20:34 <strcat[m]> it really doesn't sound like it worked right
05:20:46 <strcat[m]> if you didn't lock it's not done being installed
05:21:05 <awwadd> Ok, well I am in the area now where I enter in my wifi and time zone etc.
05:21:20 <awwadd> I typed in Fastboot flashing lock, but it just says 'Wait for any device'
05:21:35 <strcat[m]> you need to be in the bootloader menu
05:21:57 <strcat[m]> you're not done installing and if it didn't complete properly it may be a good idea to reinstall
05:22:02 <strcat[m]> you're not making it clear what happened
05:22:10 <strcat[m]> you are not done installing though
05:22:38 <awwadd> Ok sure, should I turn the phone off and try the entire process from scratch?
05:22:50 <awwadd> All I know is that I ran the process again, and it all just seemed to.. work.
05:23:34 <strcat[m]> awwadd: if you did it again and it all worked
05:23:36 <strcat[m]> all you need to do is lock
05:23:44 <awwadd> Ok sure,
05:24:08 <strcat[m]> maybe the USB cable lost packets on your 1st try but not 2nd
05:24:20 <strcat[m]> just lock and if it verifies properly after that you're done
05:25:25 <awwadd> Ok, I have just locked the bootloader
05:27:19 <awwadd> Booting up now. All seems to be in order?
05:29:05 <awwadd> Just to confirm here.
05:29:06 <awwadd> A properly installed, new suite of Graphene should open to a blank, black background with no apps. Is that correct?
05:29:52 <strcat[m]> it has apps there
05:30:02 <strcat[m]> the first boot should do SetupWizard
05:30:15 <strcat[m]> if it said it's locked it's all good
05:30:20 <awwadd> Sorry, I mean, no apps currently placed on the home screen.
05:30:39 <strcat[m]> it has apps placed there
05:30:43 <awwadd> Hmmm.
05:30:45 <awwadd> Interesting.,
05:31:05 <strcat[m]> if there aren't apps there something is wrong
05:31:09 <awwadd> Mine only has the phone, messaging, chrome and the camera on the bottom pedestal
05:31:11 <awwadd> Is that right?
05:31:16 <strcat[m]> yes
05:31:27 <strcat[m]> you can verify the install with Auditor
05:31:34 <strcat[m]> but if you actually locked and it said 'booting another OS' on boot
05:31:42 <strcat[m]> that mean it verified the whole OS
05:31:46 <awwadd> Yes that's what it said.
05:34:11 <strcat[m]> I just thought you meant literally no apps
05:34:13 <strcat[m]> when you said none
05:36:27 <awwadd> Oh, no, sorry. I have 13 apps here.

05:37:23 <awwadd> Sorry, DC's there.
05:37:30 <take_a_deep_brea> how come telegraph?
05:37:55 <awwadd> Sorry, did I say Telegraph?
05:37:58 <awwadd> I meant Telephone
05:38:03 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
05:38:06 <awwadd> I DC's there and didn't see any answers after my last message.
05:38:11 <awwadd> But does that App list sound ok?
05:38:29 <take_a_deep_brea> sure
05:38:40 <awwadd> Phew!
05:38:54 <take_a_deep_brea> awwadd:  which device?
05:39:04 <awwadd> Pixel 4
05:39:14 <take_a_deep_brea> a good one .
05:40:05 <strcat[m]> awwadd: it's all good I just got worried when you said there were no apps
05:40:21 <strcat[m]> the OS is being verified fully on boot since it's locked successfully
05:40:42 <strcat[m]> you can use Auditor a further way of verifying
05:42:55 <awwadd> Thanks very much for all your help strcat[m] , really apprecaite it.
05:43:15 <somenerd[m]> > anyone trying to support him will be permanently banned from the GrapheneOS community, same goes for supporting anyone harassing any of the others developers etc.
05:43:15 <somenerd[m]> I think that you banned him in a bit of haste, I think that they were trying to see what you meant
05:43:33 <somenerd[m]> but were quite shocked as they were the person that introduced them to Graphene
05:43:41 <somenerd[m]> in the first place
05:44:09 <strcat[m]> they're free to message me
05:44:57 <strcat[m]> somenerd: I have a pretty low tolerance for people putting words in my mouth and misrepresenting my statements
05:45:07 <somenerd[m]> I can see why honestly
05:45:16 <somenerd[m]> I'm trying to reach out to techlore
05:45:35 <strcat[m]> I reached out to him before there was a public conflict and he just ignored me
05:45:45 <strcat[m]> and doubled down on directing harassment towards me
05:46:22 <strcat[m]> I don't really see a point in messaging him
05:46:35 <somenerd[m]> I didn't message him personally
05:46:41 <somenerd[m]> the person you banned
05:46:58 <somenerd[m]> was talking about it
05:47:24 <somenerd[m]> when he said that you were a bit abrasive and banned in haste
05:47:28 <somenerd[m]> in techlore's room
05:47:41 <somenerd[m]> should I dm this?
05:48:23 <somenerd[m]> it feels unnecessary to post this here
06:12:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> somenerd: you have to ask me, not strcat
06:13:11 <somenerd[m]> oh ok should I pm you?
06:13:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
06:13:32 <somenerd[m]> sure
07:02:21 <Tyler> Hello
07:02:36 <somenerd[m]> hi
07:02:40 <Tyler> I am currently trying to flash Graphene
07:05:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tyler: read the install guide
07:05:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Good luck
07:05:49 <Tyler> Thank you
07:05:50 <Tyler> I have
07:05:59 <take_a_deep_brea> Tyler:  good for you . also https://graphenos.org/install
07:06:11 <take_a_deep_brea>  * Tyler:  good for you . also https://grapheneos.org/install
07:06:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I actually wanted to make a video I could update as needed to tell people how to install
07:06:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> But webusb will make it useless
07:06:32 <somenerd[m]> also don't use third party videos
07:06:36 <take_a_deep_brea> Tyler:  just in case you were folowing some other guide
07:06:41 <Tyler> Consistently receiving error

07:07:13 <somenerd[m]> > I actually wanted to make a video I could update as needed to tell people how to install
07:07:13 <somenerd[m]> maybe do it, a lot of people are using third party videos
07:07:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nice
07:07:33 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ngSfsihUiEIvFDeSJIvaSsvK/message.txt >
07:08:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's like 10 fps or so btw
07:09:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Was kind of hard to pull this on my pc btw
07:10:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> (I had to disable windows firewall and the SRP)
07:10:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mostly because my firewall settings block curl and srp would not allow adb to execute from an untrusted path
07:11:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> (I mostly have full W^X enforcement on my windows)
07:12:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> However most users don't enable these features so they're safe
07:12:55 <Tyler> Windows firewall does get in my way sometimes lol
07:14:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tyler: no
07:14:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> I blacklist a lot of executables I don't use
07:15:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example when is the last time you used curl in powershell?
07:15:13 <Tyler> That's fair
07:15:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Before this guide
07:15:26 <Tyler> I recently started using linux
07:15:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> If anything it could be used as a lolbin
07:15:54 <take_a_deep_brea> whats lolbin?
07:16:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> take_a_deep_breath: you use OS executables itself to attack the system
07:16:50 <take_a_deep_brea> ok just looking that up on my duck search
07:16:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Most badness enumerators can never classify this as malicious
07:17:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because in their eyes a program is legitimately using the system
07:17:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Often best to block stuff like ms office on windows
07:17:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or file explorer
07:17:22 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao , Golang had some issue with windows
07:17:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or using the system to download a payload
07:18:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Again, badness enumerators will think this is perfectly legitimate
07:27:03 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20210122_125644_229.PNG (147KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/NqXKsBRvbiARGpANXiHJWsXQ/IMG_20210122_125644_229.PNG >
07:27:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> What would actually happen
07:27:55 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> anupritaisno1: Any guides on this?
07:27:55 <take_a_deep_brea> i see
07:28:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: no
07:28:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> You get a person to design a policy for you. It's quite hard for users to write their own
07:29:27 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Any chance you could share yours?
07:29:56 <take_a_deep_brea> Group policy is what ,something like selinux ?
07:29:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: no not really
07:30:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mine is just too strict
07:30:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'd block legitimate applications too
07:30:43 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah .
07:31:45 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Does that prevent from sharing? :P
07:31:45 <somenerd[m]> this is a bit offtopic
07:31:45 <somenerd[m]> and by a bit, I mean a lot
07:38:37 <ffddrrooiidd> he guys. I think I've managed to install it correctly on my pixel 4a. However one thing I am not sure of. When I restart the device I am getting a message: You are trying to load a different OS", followed by an Image of Google and then it starts graphene. Is this normal behaviour?
07:40:19 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yes
07:42:23 <ffddrrooiidd> glad to hear that :)  thanks skyfox
07:44:42 <take_a_deep_brea> ffddrrooiidd: that is because an alternative OS like graphene is not the Stock Pixel OS  . as custom keys are flashed for verified boot , the device detects this and shows up that warning .
07:46:06 <ffddrrooiidd> Yeah I suspected this as well, but I am not a geek so I needed confirmation from you guys....I feel liberated :)
10:09:32 <bitc0d> Hi there
10:09:43 <bitc0d> Is it this os without any google services available for P5?
10:16:02 <AppAraat[m]> uhm, OS is letting me know that certain permissions (Phone) were automatically removed from CarrierDefaultApp, is this good? Y/N
10:18:45 <take_a_deep_brea> AppAraat:  if everything works as expected for you , then it should be fine .
10:19:25 <AppAraat[m]> kinda hard to test that, isn't it? ;)
10:22:54 <take_a_deep_brea> well sorry for that shallow comment but could you give more details ? like did you toggle Remove permissions if app isnt used ? in App permissions ?
10:25:22 <take_a_deep_brea> AppAraat: Carrier default apps are notorious for asking too many permissions
10:26:02 <take_a_deep_brea> one of the reasons why it is harder to support a wide variety of carriers on graphene
10:26:53 <AppAraat[m]> > did you toggle Remove permissions if app isnt used
10:26:53 <AppAraat[m]> I think that's enabled for me for all apps (by default?)
10:27:21 <AppAraat[m]> But I guess I'll see whether it breaks anything and report back.
10:53:49 <COVID-1984> What's with all of the timeouts?
10:54:11 <pichtron> netsplit
10:54:21 <pichtron> servers desynchronisation
12:47:26 <nscnt[m]> AppAraat: I think this could be an issue if you change carriers. Otherwise it's not a problem
13:18:03 <hai[m]> Hi !! Is there a way to share the screen of the telephone ? I plugged a usb-c switch with HDMI to my TV but nothing appeared. Thx !
13:19:00 <mynacol[m]> ◊ó◊ô: I think we had this discussion yesterday. Currently, Grapehe does not support video out (iirc)
13:20:27 <hai[m]> Thx ! I read the messages today but not yesterday üòÖ
13:56:01 <frontman[m]> take_a_deep_breath: that would be neat if it was customized to say "you are loading a ((((non authorized)))) operating system" haha
15:15:58 <claytoncarney> Just flashed my phone with sargo-factory-2021.01.05.03. Setting.Display.Dark Theme is On. However, several of the stock apps (Phone, Messaging, Contacts, etc.) are not running in Dark Mode. Any idea why?
15:20:53 <mynacol[m]> claytoncarney: Yeah, they don't support dark mode. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/406
15:22:06 <claytoncarney> thank you mynacoi
15:30:44 <zknshfr[m]> Will GrapheneOS implement 'Ask me every time' fort Network feature?
15:30:54 <zknshfr[m]> * Will GrapheneOS implement 'Ask me every time' for Network feature?
15:32:37 <somenerd[m]> probably not
15:33:01 <somenerd[m]> the app could just store data until it gets the permission
15:33:15 <somenerd[m]> also apps can't really ask for the network perm
15:33:32 <somenerd[m]> (not made to, as it's solely a GrapheneOS feature)
15:34:15 <somenerd[m]> > the app could just store data until it gets the permission
15:34:15 <somenerd[m]> and then exfiltrate it
15:57:10 <zknshfr[m]> Got it
16:38:19 <baldgeek123[m]> Does secure start up work in GrapheneOS? It doesn't appear as an option when setting a password on the Google Pixel 4a.
16:43:57 <claytoncarney> I've turned off every vibrate setting I can find, but the GrapheneOS keyboard still vibrates. Very annoying. Any ideas?
16:44:25 <take_a_deep_brea> baldgeek123: if by secure startup you mean being prompted for password on reboot then that is a redundant feature as filesystem based encryption is enforced and if you set a password then the only way to make use of all system features is by deriving the encryption key which canot be done without your password / pin
16:44:58 <take_a_deep_brea> the key being necessary to decrypt system files
16:48:33 <baldgeek123[m]> Okay thanks!

18:43:13 <tyler> Hello
18:43:40 <tyler> Would this be the appropriate channel for GrapheneOS install questions?
18:46:08 <lodtank> yes, you're right
18:46:48 <tyler> Awesome
18:47:34 <tyler> I have been trying to flash the latest release onto a Pixel 4a on pop os and keep running into the same issue
18:47:44 <tyler> Setting current slot to 'b'¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† FAILED (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')
18:48:21 <tyler> I haven't been able to find good documentation on this issue
18:52:30 <keruss0[m]> is there a way to search for previously asked/answered questions?  Would hate to repeat something already commented on.
18:54:26 <tyler> I second that
18:57:01 <obi[m]> <tyler "I haven't been able to find good"> I have a 4a and am running PopOS as well. Followed official install instructions and had no problems. I haven't even seen that error before. Sorry
19:01:49 <tyler> Well at least I can rule out PopOS potentially causing problems. Thanks!
19:57:22 <tyler> fastboot snapshot-update cancel
19:57:40 <tyler> this command fixed my issue. Excited to start using Graphene!
20:11:13 <jcypher> Does anyone know how to import a .vcf file for contacts, on a Pixel 4 without getting the 'Couldn't import vCard" error?
20:14:45 <delllaptop[m]> <jcypher "Does anyone know how to import a"> Where/how did you create it? Usually just works...
20:16:51 <jcypher> delllaptop[m] I exported all my contacts from ProtonMail. I then uploaded to the .vcf my cloud service, pCloud, as well the phone itself. I wasn't able to import into the contacts app using either method.
20:19:20 <delllaptop[m]>  I have regularly imported vcf from Thunderbird/Google calendar works great. Open vcf in text editor to see if there are any formatting errors.
20:42:37 <jcypher> Thank you, delllaptop[m]. Looks like ProtonMail added some additional fields in the .vcf. I'll reformat it and try again.
20:53:32 <delllaptop[m]> If possible open a bug report at proton mail. Likely the overlap between graphene and proton are more.
21:01:35 <ih8x509[m]> With GrapheneOS, what google software (if any) remains on the device (ie via firmware)? If such software remains, what risk does this pose to the user? Is it possible that malicious firmware can exfiltrate data from the filesystem, microphone, or camera? I've tried to look into these more paranoid questions online but I've had trouble finding answers
21:06:22 <TheJollyRoger> ih8x509[m]: no risk. The firmware is controlled by the host and initialized by the host, and under host control via SMMU; the firmware is also not a state-carrying element and rebooting the device should restore it to the previous condition. The firmware can only write to or read from data that the driver in the kernel explicitly allows it to.
21:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> There are no closed source drivers on the Pixels.
21:07:19 <ih8x509[m]> That's awesome, thanks for the quick reply!
21:07:40 <TheJollyRoger> Keep your firmware updated. While the firmware is a highly privileged component of any modern handset, the firmware is a small portion of the big picture.
21:08:26 <TheJollyRoger> There are no google services in GrapheneOS.
21:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> That said,
21:08:35 <TheJollyRoger> if you're concerned about using Google software, don't use Linux.
21:09:13 <TheJollyRoger> Use Windows or MacOS instead.
21:09:21 <ih8x509[m]> I probably should have said "proprietary" instead of "google" lol
21:09:29 <dakotah[m]> <TheJollyRoger "if you're concerned about using "> What?
21:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> dakotah[m]: For the past half-decade at least, Google has been one of the top ten contributors of code to the Linux Kernel.
21:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> They've also been one of the biggest driving forces behind security improvements in the Kernel and the initiative behind Syzbot which has exposed countless bugs in the kernel that upstream missed.
21:11:05 <dakotah[m]> oh I thought concerned meant like Google software can't be used on it. I still feel that is an unwarrented statement
21:11:19 <TheJollyRoger> Most toxic power users forget this fact, so I like to joke about it :)
21:11:28 <TheJollyRoger> *toxic power users/self-defeating privacy enthusiasts
21:15:54 <TheJollyRoger> ih8x509[m]: sooner or later, you have to trust someone. Zero trust computing doesn't exist. Nevertheless, there are steps in place to try to provide mitigations, and this is why GrapheneOS chooses the pixels; it's because they have the strongest isolation and mitigations there, with respect to isolating the host from the devices.
21:18:34 <ih8x509[m]> Indeed. These mitigations fascinate me and the GrapheneOS community so far has been the first to show me them.
21:18:34 <ih8x509[m]> So, what about taking this up a notch and talking about hardware backdoors? Is it possible that some chip could read data or utilize components of the device, then utilize the WiFi, baseband, or Bluetooth to exfiltrate data unbeknownst to the OS? Is the architecture known enough to rule this out or does trust need to start here? Lol
21:19:30 <ih8x509[m]> I think supermicro had a known issue with this, servers were calling back to China or something
21:19:40 <mynacol[m]> ih8x509: Read the rules in the channel info
21:20:01 <TheJollyRoger> ih8x509[m]: I'm not averse to having discussions about backdoors in offtopic, so long as it doesn't devolve into bikeshedding.
21:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> Truth be told though, a backdoor doesn't work like you think it does.
21:20:22 <ih8x509[m]> Will do, apologizes if I broke a rule. I can move this to off topic
21:22:26 <TheJollyRoger> It's no problem, just, we don't do speculation.
22:12:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's unlikely that such back doors exist in the pixel hardware, but maybe someone more knowledgeable can give a more detailed answer.
22:12:50 <mynacol[m]> cyborgninjaneer: You should look into the off topic chat. We discussed it there already.
22:17:53 <TheJollyRoger> ty mynacol[m]
22:20:30 <mynacol[m]> TheJollyRoger: On your command, Cap'n
22:22:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> Ah yes, I see some good info in there
