00:09:11 <RunniingMan> Question. I know the Pixel XL from Verizon can not be with GrapheneOS. Will the Pixel 5 from Spectrum Mobilegg work with GrapheneOS? Don‚Äôt know if this matter, Spectrum is an MVNO using Verizon‚Äôs network. Thanks.
00:18:43 <M0s_and_1s[m]> What sensor permissions are safe to disable in Graphene without breaking things?
00:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> M0s_and_1s[m]: only for apps you install.
00:19:39 <M0s_and_1s[m]> Okay. I‚Äôve just kept the default for now so I‚Äôm glad that I did
00:20:13 <TheJollyRoger> Don't do it for apps that come preinstalled. The only reason why the GrapheneOS permissions (sensors and network) are still shown for system apps is because we would need to go through every single one of those system apps and then have them added to the manifest, app by app, on a case by case basis.
00:20:57 <TheJollyRoger> So it's safe to leave them as they are for system apps and for apps that come preinstalled with GrapheneOS.
00:23:49 <M0s_and_1s[m]> Good to know. I just realized Graphene will deny permissions for apps that have been unused for a few months. That‚Äôs a great feature
00:23:58 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed!
00:24:56 <M0s_and_1s[m]> I used to use bouncer to manage android permissions, but now that ‚Äúallow while using‚Äù is an option theres no need for that anymore
00:26:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. GrapheneOS will also show you when the camera and microphone are active, in the top right hand corner of your screen.
00:28:36 <M0s_and_1s[m]> Yep just like in iOS. Speaking of which, I‚Äôd love to see comparison of the security features between the two. I know that Micay has said they ‚Äútrade blows‚Äù but a write up on that would be awesome
00:31:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:38:21 <Yourmomuwu[m]> <M0s_and_1s[m] "Yep just like in iOS. Speaking o"> that was also year or two ago. we need new info
00:44:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> "We need new info", implies strcpy is obligated to provide that sort of in-depth analysis, which they aren't.
00:44:50 <rny> im strstr btw
00:45:26 <jjstopper[m]> Why does an app like AntennaPod for podcasts get sensors permission when I install it? And if it has sensors permission what does that allow?
00:45:32 <hypokeimenon[m]> I'll call you anything you like strstr
00:45:51 <strstr> im gonna register this nick
00:46:06 <strstr> LOL
00:47:42 <gkajdlfjaksldjfa> Hi, I was wondering if anyone could tell me of a multi device 2fa that works on Graphene? I usually use authy because I can put it on my ios mobile, android, windows and linux.
00:47:56 <strstr> aegis
00:48:24 <strstr> or you mean cross-platform?
00:48:39 <strstr> pls ask in #grapheneos-offtopic
00:49:10 <gkajdlfjaksldjfa> ya, cross platform
01:35:38 <jabs> Hi all, this may seem like a dumb question, but if I install an apk with Google Firebase/Crashlytics, is there a way to prevent it from phoning home or strip these trackers out?
01:43:34 <evdevd> no
01:45:08 <jabs> Ok, thanks
02:03:42 <methodman[m]> <jabs "Hi all, this may seem like a dum"> You can block sites via DNS. Using a blocklist/blacklist. Pihole, nextdns or several other providers can do this
02:04:46 <methodman[m]> There are apps like netguard that can block the app completely
02:05:39 <methodman[m]> DNS66 app can also block trackers if you aren't using the VPN function. (Dns66 uses the VPN function)
02:22:11 <strcat[m]> use the Network toggle
02:22:13 <strcat[m]> nothing else truly works
02:22:32 <strcat[m]> if you don't disallow network access, an app can send data anywhere if it wants, including via DNS
02:40:48 <bizanon[m]> Is it possible to export cookies from vanadium to another vanadium or desktop chrome?
02:42:28 <TheJollyRoger> No, it isn't, if the app doesn't provide you with tools to export data and disallows that data to be backed up, plundering the app's private data storage is very specifically forbidden by the Android security policy.
02:42:59 <bizanon[m]> I see thanks
02:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
05:38:36 <KoryMac> Hi everyone
05:38:40 <KoryMac> How are you all doing
05:39:41 <KoryMac> I'd like to ask if there are any decent community builds of Graphene for a non-google phone.
05:40:31 <KoryMac> I understand that only pixels are currently targeted by the main release channel, and I'm sure that there are good reasons for that. But I really don't like google.
05:51:17 <fuzzy828[m]> This is a bit of a stupid question im sure...but since im considering grapheneos, is there a way to back up the device? Like smart switch almost?
05:51:24 <Dylanger[m]> <KoryMac "I'd like to ask if there are any"> There is not, and there are no plans of bringing support to a non-Google device
05:54:45 <buyabez[m]> Hi there. I have some trouble installing GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a 5G. My host OS is Ubuntu 20.04, and I'm using the latest version of Google Chrome. In the Web installer "Flashing release" runs into a timeout during the step "Writing system..."
06:11:40 <nscnt[m]> buyabez: It might be worth trying a different cable/port
06:12:47 <buyabez[m]> cable is the one that came with the phone. The phone/cable is pretty new, so I would not expect that it has any issues
06:13:21 <nscnt[m]> buyabez: Port?
06:14:43 <buyabez[m]> there is only a single USB-C port on my workstation
06:15:41 <buyabez[m]> @nscnt: is it worth looking into the BIOS settings? since you mentioned the port
06:15:51 <nscnt[m]> buyabez: No, not worth it
06:15:54 <sphinx[m]> fuzzy828: GrapheneOS includes [Seedvault](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/) for backing up / restoring app data and the OS itself. If you are talking about migrating data from another OS... then no, you wold have to do what you can manually.
06:19:49 <nscnt[m]> buyabez: Connectivity issues are the biggest problem for users during installation. In this case, we can poorly provide support and the user is left on their own to try different ones. It would be worth trying with a different cable and port
06:20:25 <sphinx[m]> s/wold/would
06:21:35 <buyabez[m]> nscnt:
06:21:55 <buyabez[m]> nscnt: Does the command line installer provide any additional debug messages?
06:23:17 <nscnt[m]> buyabez: No. If the WebUSB-based installer doesn't work, the CLI installation doesn't work either
06:25:45 <buyabez[m]> nscnt: ok thanks...
07:36:54 <fikaso> i have tryed looking for an app or a way to change app icons, ex i want to change wickr icon for gmail icon. The only way i have found so far is trough nova launcher but does this lowers security or in some way makes the system more vulnerable ?
07:37:12 <fikaso> using pixel 3
07:37:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
07:37:51 <fikaso> ok damn. found apk editor but doesnt work with latest android
07:39:44 <fikaso> also looking for maybe an app to add a second pin code to wipe the phone as extra security but even there prob lowers security on the phone

11:23:31 <pikey[m]> Hi all. I have Pixel 3 running Graphene, finally have a bit of cash for the P4a, not sure whether to make the jump or not. This P3 works very nice but I do miss the 3.5mm audio jack! The only problem I have with it is the camera crashes (Open Camera and native Camera app). Does anyone know if the cameras work better on the P4a? Thanks
11:32:39 <lodtank> i'm not very experienced, but didn't have any camera problems on my 4a yet
11:32:45 <lodtank> haven't used a 3 though
11:36:42 <pikey[m]> thanks. had problems for a good year or more. its not too often to make it unusable, but i do fear the day i need an important clip and it crashes. the way it happens, you dont actually know it crashed until you press the button to stop recording, until then it looks like it's recording. if the 4a doesn't have this problem then it would definitely help me make the move! How are you finding the 4a? any problems OS wise?
11:37:49 <lodtank> i didn't use it much... so perhaps wait for some more answeres here regarding pictures/videos
11:38:03 <lodtank> besides that i can't really complain, neither hardware nor software side
11:38:11 <lodtank> works pretty fine
11:57:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> I just use a gcam 7.4 and gcam 8.1 port on my Graphene pixel 4a
11:59:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> Using this additional APK -https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
12:02:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> So basically same Pixel camera functionality without GMS
12:04:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hmmm, is it possible to confine it within a user profile?
12:08:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> I haven't tried it - I did check permissions and it requires none
12:12:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> I know from my own experience that this APK, also allowed me to install and use the Recorder app for dictation and transcription
12:12:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> Which luckily also works offline
12:18:12 <mUncheR> I just use Signal Note to self.
12:18:45 <mUncheR> That encrypts the recording

15:07:57 <onyxrubber> Pixel 4a 5g - system color accents (can't find)
15:07:58 <onyxrubber> How to change the color of the system accents, such as the toggles in notifications area, or toggles and check boxes in the system settings (they are affected by the same setting). I tried to find the setting, but couldn't.
15:07:58 <onyxrubber> Android version 11 (grapheneOS)
15:09:55 <nscnt[m]> onyxrubber: You cannot find it because the setting doesn't exist
15:10:19 <yes25> why ? it is present in stock android
15:10:51 <nscnt[m]> GrapheneOS is based on AOSP, not the stock OS
15:11:08 <yes25> then is there a way to change the accent colors ?
15:11:27 <yes25> with a 3rd party app perhaps ?
15:12:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> 3rd party launchers might help here, but you will increase your attach surface significantly by using one
15:12:32 <lain[m]1> offtopic
15:12:39 <yes25> launchers do not affect the notification area
15:13:17 <yes25> launhcers can only change the homescreen
15:14:03 <yes25> is there something that can change the accent color ?
15:15:07 <somenerd[m]> > launhcers can only change the homescreen
15:15:07 <somenerd[m]> yeah, that still adds to attack surface
15:15:22 <yes25> i dont want to change the homescreen at all
15:15:34 <yes25> i only want to change the system accent color
15:17:05 <yes25> only the color of the toggles in the notification area and system settings
15:17:08 <yes25> thats it
15:17:20 <yes25> can this be done ? blue is really irritating
15:17:47 <nscnt[m]> yes25: No, you can't. It's currently not supported
15:18:03 <yes25> is it at least planned ?
15:19:27 <nscnt[m]> Not sure. Some is planned to implement it to mirror the stock OS. But not sure about that one
15:19:52 <nscnt[m]> mirror *more of the stock OS
15:21:24 <yes25> so its reasonable to expect it in the next update ?
15:21:36 <yes25> *major update
15:21:38 <nscnt[m]> no
15:21:46 <yes25> next year ?
15:22:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes25: there much more important things to be done first
15:22:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Your best bet would be if AOSP themselves do it first (which they probably won't)
15:23:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Please stop asking about it, as it does not improve security nor privacy

20:06:55 <senecow[m]> * I have calyx on a 4a and want to try graphene. Would it be OK to install graphene directly? Or should I go back to stock android, then install graphene?
20:19:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hi there senecow[m], you can just install overtop Calyx, the procedure is the same.
20:19:24 <TheJollyRoger> Your seedvault backups you took on Calyx should be restorable to GrapheneOS.
20:21:38 <TheJollyRoger> senecow[m]: Take your backup to a USB drive and write your recovery code words on something like a sheet of cardboard, then go back to the developer menu to enable OEM unlocking, reboot, and reboot to the bootloader using the combo keys. Plug your phone in the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web should handle the rest from there via any compatible browser that supports WebUSB;
20:21:40 <TheJollyRoger> adb, fastboot, and flashing scripts are not required.
20:24:25 <senecow[m]> Thankyou!
20:25:20 <TheJollyRoger> Once your installation is finished and bootloader's locked, you should be good to go and the GrapheneOS launcher will give you the option to restore your seedvault backup the first time you launch the phone. You should restore it then. Although there are ways to use debugging mode to trigger the launcher afterward, I don't generally recommend that because seedvault assumes you will be restoring
20:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> into an empty profile, and will restore some of your system settings... so it's not recommended to do that in production.
20:25:26 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome! Welcome aboard the ship!
20:26:44 <TheJollyRoger> senecow[m]: one thing I should caution you about: Seedvault only backs up the owner profile, and only the apps, and appdata for apps that specifically allow themselves to be backed up.
20:27:12 <TheJollyRoger> Your photos, movies, music, the contents of your shared storage, and depending on your version of seedvault, the contact list, that's on you to back up on your own.
20:27:36 <TheJollyRoger> As well as any other profiles, those you'll need to back up separately.
20:29:28 <senecow[m]> Good to know. I don't have anything to back up, so I'm not too worried. Just got this phone.
20:29:32 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:35:21 <bluelightbulb[m]> Is there a native option to reset Graphene to completely wipe all data from the phone or do I have to manually uninstall an reinstall it?
20:35:21 <bluelightbulb[m]> I did a first test and installed all sorts of stuff (/shit) but now want to make Graphene my daily driver. That's why I need a clean phone again.
20:35:45 <TheJollyRoger> bluelightbulb[m]: If you're already running GrapheneOS, you may do a factory reset to wipe all data.
20:36:29 <TheJollyRoger> There are several degrees of "resetability" that you're afforded:
20:36:47 <TheJollyRoger> Go to "Settings -> System -> Reset Options"
20:37:32 <TheJollyRoger> You can choose to reset only your WiFi, Mobile & Bluetooth pairings, your application preferences, or you can choose to reset the phone which will be equivalent to a full reinstallation of the operating system and get a fresh start.
20:38:10 <TheJollyRoger> As would be expected, a factory reset will wipe all data, there is no "oops" switch, even if you remember the password.
20:41:21 <bluelightbulb[m]> Thank you, I was unsure about this option as it is called "factory" reset and Graphene is not what can be considered out of factory.
20:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Well, the good news is, that now because GrapheneOS is installed to the system partition, and the bootloader is now locked (if you completed the installation!) with the GrapheneOS keys, GrapheneOS is now considered "factory" for your phone.
20:42:23 <bluelightbulb[m]> So when I do the factory reset (Graphene is running on the device already) I will still be on Graphene but it will just wipe all the data from the phone?
20:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to get it back to the operating system that it came with, you would need to install the Google operating system back to it.
20:42:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you will return to a fresh install of GrapheneOS, not GoogleOS.
20:43:00 <bluelightbulb[m]> Awesome, thanks!
20:43:07 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome, hope this helps!
20:44:01 <bluelightbulb[m]> Getting Google back? Never ever üôÇ
20:44:16 <bluelightbulb[m]> Graphene works so extremely well
20:44:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehehe glad to hear that! P.-)
20:44:35 <bluelightbulb[m]> Yes it did help a lot, thanks again!
20:44:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~

22:04:23 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "senecow: one thing I should caut"> Can i only migrate my keepass.kdbx file i don't need the backup the rest of the phone
22:04:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Cliff[m], if that's all you need.
22:05:37 <TheJollyRoger> Just, anytime you unlock or relock the bootloader, the phone's tokens used to decrypt the drive are shredded, so anything on the SSD will be lost.
22:05:48 <TheJollyRoger> *or issue a factory reset.
22:06:49 <TheJollyRoger> A few people, myself included, have had data loss accidents this way, so that's why I always stress it ahead of time.
22:08:51 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "*or issue a factory reset."> Where can i find seedvault when searched settings i only see app info
22:09:35 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]:  Seedvault is under Settings -> System -> Backup.
22:10:24 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Cliff:  Seedvault is under Setti"> Thanks!
22:11:56 <sphinx[m]> Cliff: isn't the keepass file stored in the home directory?
22:16:07 <Cliff[m]> sphinx what is home directory it is stored in downloads for me
22:22:27 <TheJollyRoger> KeePassDroid allows you to choose where you store your keepass database file.
22:28:13 <sphinx[m]> Cliff: I don't think Seedvault can back that up at the moment, just do it yourself
22:28:18 <metalwind[m]> New to Graphene couple of questions,
22:28:18 <metalwind[m]> Is it just me gesture navigation doesn't work for? I can't swipe from the edges to go back?
22:28:18 <metalwind[m]> And I can't cleared the cache on media storage is that graphene or android 11?
22:30:35 <skwisgaar[m]> dhainfvaidmska: idk about media cache but I‚Äôve been using gesture navigation for a while now and it works fine
22:30:56 <skwisgaar[m]> Maybe try restarting the device/profile and see if it works if you just changed it
22:32:27 <Punisher79> hello
22:32:39 <Punisher79> i habe a litle problem with instalation
22:37:54 <sphinx[m]> Punisher79: what problem?
22:39:05 <Punisher79> why make this $ env: Path = "$ pwd \ platform-tools; $ env: Path"
22:39:47 <Punisher79> because when make fastboot devices
22:40:32 <Punisher79> no devices back again for platform tools
22:48:20 <TheJollyRoger> Punisher79: Please use the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web . The commandline installation is only offered these days for historical preservation purposes, and should not be used if you're not already familiar with the process.
22:48:54 <TheJollyRoger> Note that if you have any problems with the web installer, you will have the same problems with the commandline installer.
22:49:15 <Punisher79> i can t ~web installer not reconet my phone
22:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> Then the commandline installer won't help.
22:50:13 <TheJollyRoger> You may be missing the driver; please read the instructions in their entirety to find out how to get Windows update to detect that the driver's missing and install it via Windows update.
22:50:37 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, if the web installer doesn't work, the commandline installer won't work either.
22:51:49 <Punisher79> i see
22:52:10 <TheJollyRoger> The instluctions on https://grapheneos.org/install/web will tell you what you need to do to get the missing driver and what state your phone must be in in order for it to be detected.
22:52:13 <TheJollyRoger> *instructions
22:53:34 <Punisher79> i install¬† all
22:53:55 <Punisher79> when i make fastboot flashing unlock
22:54:03 <Punisher79> waiting for any device
22:54:21 <TheJollyRoger> There isn't anything you need to install to install GrapheneOS. If you've followed a third party guide and installed third-party software, uninstall it, or you may be heading for a brick.
22:55:13 <TheJollyRoger> Punisher79: either the phone has not been connected in fastboot, your motherboard firmware or USB cable does not have the wiring low-level device debugging, or your operating system is missing the driver.
22:55:21 <TheJollyRoger> Please view the instructions on getting the driver.
22:55:29 <Punisher79> the phone is new
22:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> Please view the instructions on getting the driver.
22:55:45 <TheJollyRoger> You are missing the driver.
22:56:25 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
22:57:08 <TheJollyRoger> Plug your phone in, and with the phone connected, check for updates.
23:01:02 <TheJollyRoger> It must be in fastboot and plugged in, to tell the computer that it needs the driver.
23:01:08 <TheJollyRoger> Windows update can install the driver.
23:01:15 <TheJollyRoger> Punisher79: That's the sign of a missing driver.
23:27:49 <pikey[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<TheGreyGhostPhantom> I just use"> Don't know what 'port' means but thanks, if you're saying I could get gcam working on graphene i might try that, although open camera does what I need if that works stable on 4a  so i may try that first.

23:36:33 <endless_strings[> Hello everyone, I bought a pixel 3a and I was following all the steps of the official website to install it on windows with powershell, everything worked except the ./flash-all.bat , it says it does not recognize the name as a cdmlet, function, archive of a script or executable program. Does anyone know why this could be happening to me?
23:38:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> endless_strings[: please, just use the web-installer
