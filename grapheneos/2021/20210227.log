00:02:35 <manug[m]> <strcat[m] "manug: there's verified boot"> Thanks yes that is what I meant. It says it can do regular checks and do email alerts. Doesn't matter. Thanks buddy
00:59:52 <peculiarly_small> If a user was to factory reset their phone in settings would that data be recoverable? I'm asking because I'm looking to sell my phone
01:01:25 <TheJollyRoger> peculiarly_small: If you factory reset your phones, the data's gone. The secure element in the phone will change its keys.
01:01:29 <TheJollyRoger> Everything will be lost.
01:03:08 <TheJollyRoger> the Pixel handsets have a very sophisticated file and metadata encryption system (there's more about it in the FAQ), and the tokens in the phone's secure element is used for key derivation. Even if someone got your phone and found out the password you used back when you used to use it, they can't recover the information from your phone, because the tokens in the secure element are gone.
01:03:58 <peculiarly_small> I see, thank you :)
01:04:09 <peculiarly_small> I have one more kinda weird question
01:04:38 <peculiarly_small> Is there a weight difference in each pixel 3a? Because one of mine is heavier than the other
01:04:46 <peculiarly_small> It's odd
01:04:52 <TheJollyRoger> I... I don't think so?
01:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> Unless...
01:04:59 <TheJollyRoger> Unless one was refurbished.
01:04:59 <peculiarly_small> And it's noticeably heavier
01:05:19 <peculiarly_small> Hmm, I got it new
01:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> We've heard reports of this happening,
01:05:50 <TheJollyRoger> Where someone buys a phone that's either secondhand or refurbished, and the refurbishment was done with a whitelabel battery, typically one that's not the same.
01:06:10 <peculiarly_small> Both phones were new from a local phone carrier
01:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hm, alright.
01:06:23 <TheJollyRoger> I'm shocked then, never heard of that happening before.
01:06:33 <peculiarly_small> Hmmmm
01:06:55 <ismellcap45[m]> If the FBI had a hold of my device would they be able to crack into my Phone? My password is a Pin 9 digits
01:08:31 <ismellcap45[m]> Pixel 3a
01:08:56 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: Well, there's are specialized tool used for extracting those, they're called thumbscrews, pins, rubber hoses, and pain-compliance holds.
01:09:03 <TheJollyRoger> *there are specialized tools
01:09:16 <peculiarly_small> Lol
01:10:03 <ismellcap45[m]> No like get into my phone
01:10:22 <ismellcap45[m]> You know how on Iphone there's cellubrite
01:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: This discussion has been had before; with respect to UFED unlockers, they are simply a guided way to run android debug bridge.
01:10:52 <TheJollyRoger> For people who don't know how.
01:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> They work on devices that are already unlocked or that you have the pincode for.
01:11:08 <TheJollyRoger> A device being supported by them is not in itself that interesting.
01:11:11 <TheJollyRoger> Now...
01:11:35 <TheJollyRoger> There are some that contain canned exploits for devices that are not recieving security patches and have not been switched off or rebooted.
01:11:45 <TheJollyRoger> But that's a niche use case
01:11:47 <TheJollyRoger> .
01:12:03 <ismellcap45[m]> So is my phone FBI proof
01:12:13 <ismellcap45[m]> Mann I'm dumb
01:12:57 <Dylanger[m]> Not quite, usually these devices contain 0day, devices can be in a locked state, exploit the device and pull everything
01:13:23 <Dylanger[m]> The ones in-field look like little raspberry pi looking things
01:14:57 <TheJollyRoger> This is why security updates are important.
01:19:57 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: in the end, your phone keep up to date. If you're worried about your phone being breached while it's switched on, do your work within a second profile and end the session when it is no longer needed.
01:21:11 <Dylanger[m]> Yes, but not in the context of ismellcap45's question, a 0day vs an up-to-date device, 0day still gonna win
01:21:11 <Dylanger[m]> > do your work within a second profile and end the session when it is no longer needed.
01:21:11 <Dylanger[m]> Yes, this should evict the keys from memory, that's a good way to go
01:21:25 <Dylanger[m]> Evicting keys üëçÔ∏è
01:23:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: fortunately for you...
01:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> As of right now there are no publicly known exploits against the Pixel's key derivation. at this moment, it's understood that a 4-digit numeric pin code on a Pixel 3, 4, or 5 (including 'a' variants) would take roughly 650 years for the key space to fully be exhausted.
01:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> Assuming that that pin code is not something like your birthday, or your high school graduation year, or the last four digits of your first crush's phone number.
01:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> Barring the possibility of finding a cure for death, I think we'll probably be all gone by that point.
01:28:23 <TheJollyRoger> *all be gone by that point
01:29:04 <Elementoshi[m]> Speaking of which, is there a good way to generate a base 10 pin number using 6 sided dice?
01:30:01 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: That's actually a great question. I'll have to get back to you on that, since the moment I start introducing multiple dice, it produces a normal distribution.
01:30:12 <TheJollyRoger> I'll puzzle that out later.
01:30:19 <Elementoshi[m]> alright
01:30:32 <Elementoshi[m]> wait a minute
01:30:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes?
01:30:47 <Elementoshi[m]> I wonder if there's a way to get a possible number of combinations that is divisible by 10
01:30:55 <Elementoshi[m]> hmm
01:31:20 <TheJollyRoger> Probably are! I just haven't thought about that at all.
01:31:37 <TheJollyRoger> Since I generally just use the password manager to generate word passphrases. They're easier for me to remembe.
01:31:38 <TheJollyRoger> *remember.
01:32:10 <TheJollyRoger> It's easier for me to remember and to type "wrong donkey fuel attachment" than base64.
01:57:47 <SRC> I got the Pixel 3 factory image installed and booted using the command line. Can I update the system over wifi or how do I apply the blueline-ota_update-2021.02.26.16.zip?
01:59:34 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: yep, you can update over wifi!
01:59:56 <SRC> Sweet
02:00:16 <TheJollyRoger> The Seamless Update Client will check in for new updates roughly every four hours or so.
02:00:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you're on the Beta channel, a new update was just pushed today.
02:00:51 <TheJollyRoger> That goes out to the Beta testers first, and once the Beta testers say "she's good!" it gets marked for stable and goes to production.
02:01:43 <SRC> Great, thanks
02:03:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If you are on a very very limited cell data allotment, you can set the update client to only download on unmetered, but this is usually superfluous, because the delta upgrades only take a couple megabytes each, it's not much.
02:12:18 <b1101> had issues with the camera on p3. new update fixed it :D
02:13:24 <TheJollyRoger> b1101: glad to hear!!
02:14:01 <b1101> 1st real "issue" I've had
02:15:59 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear it's fixed!
02:37:46 <SRC> Just installed on a pixel 3 and have a few questions: Checked for updates and it says Android 11; that is fully up to date? Are there any setting I should enable or change to 'harden' the system? I honestly through the OS would be slicker looking. It is very basic and looks like an earlier version of Lineage OS.
02:43:01 <SRC> No offense but the stock ringtones sound like they're from 1990
02:46:05 <simmered[m]> I saw the update link posted in here earlier today, how can I force the update on my device? Just going to system updates doesn't do much. Says tap to download asap but doesn't seem to.
02:47:39 <simmered[m]> Is the "build number" in about phone what will correlate?
02:52:37 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: yep, it's up to date. You can look in the build number to check to see what your latest release is. Note that stable is usually a little bit behind Beta.
02:53:34 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: Yep, we know it's a little bit bare-bones, right now, the developers are focusing all their efforts into things such as memory safety (right now they've brought back slab canaries on the Pixel 3 and 3XL) and security hardening that's under the hood.
02:54:18 <TheJollyRoger> There are only two things you should need to do to "harden" the system. The first one is: *turn off OEM unlocking*. The second one, is turn off Developer options and make sure not to disturb them.
02:54:45 <TheJollyRoger> It's been a big, big, BIG goal of GrapheneOS to have secure-by-default settings on everything; the defaults are secure and may be used with confidence.
02:54:58 <SRC> Nice
02:55:53 <TheJollyRoger> simmered[m]: Currently, the update is in Beta, they're just making sure that the update didn't break something else. When it gets marked as stable, your device should automatically ping (it checks the update server every four hours, network connectivity permitting), the update server, and download the delta updates and install them.
02:56:19 <TheJollyRoger> Once it's finished, the owner profile will get a banner notification near the top "Reboot to update."
02:56:49 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: yeah, if you like, you can download other ringtones, and use them! I like to have sound clips play for my phone, haha.
02:57:01 <TheJollyRoger> I have the Nokia 3310 ringtone on mine for ultimate hipster appeal :D
02:57:25 <TheJollyRoger> "BEEDEEDEEDEE BEEDEEDEEDEE BEE DEE DEE DE DEEEE"
02:59:33 <TheJollyRoger> simmered[m]: the "build number" in About phone should tell you the release version. You can indeed compare it with the one on the website.
02:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> Currently, if you guys are on the stable channel, yours will end in "-02.23.15"
03:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, wait, looks like Stable is pushed.
03:00:22 <TheJollyRoger> Give it some time, it should update automatically.
03:00:45 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, my bad, stable is now marked "-02.26.16" for Crosshatch and Blueline.
03:02:06 <TheJollyRoger> If it doesn't, you can sideload the update, but it's easier to simply let it take care of itself.
03:05:01 <simmered[m]> <TheJollyRoger "simmered: the "build number" in "> Thank you! This is perfect. Appreciate the info.
03:05:42 <simmered[m]> Mine is indeed 02.23.15 at the moment but I can be patient.
03:06:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome! If it doesn't update in a few hours, if you really want to update it fast you can go to the update settings and tap to force it to check now. When it finds a delta update it'll download that.
03:07:48 <simmered[m]> I'm really happy with this so far. I didn't know what to expect, but everything has been smooth and only a very small handful of apps haven't worked so far. Great work guys, seriously. Feels amazing to look in "accounts" and not see google.
03:08:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! \o/
03:09:01 <simmered[m]> I only need to figure out how to get davX working on my old phone and transfer contacts over then I'll move my sim card!
03:13:32 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome, awesome!
03:27:42 <b1101> after getting grapheneos, I switched to tmobile prepaid. I never really used data, and went with a  15$ flat/month plan. buy refills on ebay for even less. never paid this little for a phone plan
03:37:56 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Cool
03:58:48 <SRC> ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Does Graphene have cell broadcast alerts installed? Can't find it in settings
03:59:03 <SRC> Hopefully not
03:59:58 <b1101> SRC: are you talking about emergency alerts?
04:00:33 <SRC> Yes
04:00:47 <b1101> yes. they're there
04:01:14 <SRC> Where are they located? I disable them usually
04:01:24 <b1101> wireless emergency alerts
04:01:45 <SRC> Thanks
04:02:38 <b1101> I think they're more useful than they are annoying
04:03:04 <b1101> only get them from amber alerts, and really really bad weather warnings
04:06:20 <SRC> I noticed when the phone boots up it first displays the old school multicolor Google logo, before the graphene os screen loads. Is that correct?
04:07:37 <SRC> https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/08/google_logo_black-100769125-large.jpg
04:07:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's just the OEM's logo. It's a part of the late-stage qualcomm bootloader, but that part of the firmware is signed and verified. We can't change that portion.
04:08:17 <TheJollyRoger> But it's purely cosmetic.
04:08:26 <TheJollyRoger> It's an annoyance, but it's only a cosmetic one.
04:10:47 <SRC> No worries, just making sure that's how it's supposed to be
04:11:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:46:06 <bigsstonks> Thos log chats that Daniel posts on Reddit are flagged as mailcious. is there supposed to be "webchat" before the rest of the url?

09:13:03 <Shoan[m]> all sorted out now, the issue seemed to be with the auto-detection of device after bootloader restarts - after a few manual restarts of bootloader, managed to finally install via CLI method

16:08:30 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic : It's not part of GrapheneOS and GrapheneOS is not in control of it, pretty much.
16:10:24 <nscnt[m]> You don't go to Apple/Microsoft/... support when you ask for recommendations for apps or whatever. So you don't do it here either

16:32:31 <super_noob[m]> Morning folks. I switched to GrapheneOS and I loving it. I've been preaching the gospel of G-OS like crazy.  I have a question. There's a keyboard app, I used to use with my old phone: SwiftKey, which has been purchased by Microsoft. I'm having  hard time adjusting to the behaviour of the default keyboard, and really miss the SK behaviour. Can anyone recommend an f-droid keyboard that saves your words locally and
16:32:31 <super_noob[m]> predicts the next word, as well as works/behaves the same way as swiftkey?
16:37:39 <dazinism> Think you can change settings to get saving and predicting words (maybe does it automatically after a bit of use?? Can't remember)
16:37:40 <dazinism> If you are after Swype typing the only open source keyboard with that is AnySoftKeyboard
16:37:41 <louipc> hi super_noob[m] glad youre enjoying grapheneos. I don't know of any, but you might be able to get suggestions at #grapheneos-offtopic room/channel where there's discussion about 3rd party apps/services
16:38:08 <dazinism> Maybe doesn't work as well
16:38:17 <dazinism> Also not as secure as using the default keyboard
16:38:36 <dazinism> Keyboard is important as it knows everything you type

18:01:18 <BusyTee> junoslukan[m] Thank you for your answer. I think i found the problem as i was using a non root user. It seems sudo didnt work on that account to install the package. With the root user i was able to install the package. I will try to work it out with that. Is there an advantage using the standalone platform tools?
18:02:09 <BusyTee> sorry still working out the tweaks of this chatroom

18:27:35 <junoslukan[m]> <BusyTee "junoslukan Thank you for your an"> No worries! The main question would be the version of `fastboot`. In the CLI installation instruction, it says:
18:30:20 <junoslukan[m]> Since I haven't used the Web Install, I am not sure what else you need the platform tools for in that case. But if it's only for udev rules, then it should be fine, see:
18:30:20 <junoslukan[m]> > The udev rules on Debian and Ubuntu are very out-of-date but the package has the rules needed for Pixel phones since the same USB IDs have been used for many years.
18:51:54 <zzxx123> you can edit then udev rule
18:52:18 <zzxx123> and get correct ids using lsusb
18:54:30 <zzxx123> but again, I would just use Manjaro
19:22:39 <stinkytoes[m]> Hello! I‚Äôm thinking about purchasing a Pixel and installing Graphene OS. I have a question about VPN connections. Is there a way in Graphene OS to set up and actual VPN killswitch. The killswitch feature on iOS is horrible... I‚Äôm looking for something like if even I disconnect the VPN the device lose all connectivity.
19:24:33 <methodman[m]2> <stinkytoes[m] "Hello! I‚Äôm thinking about purcha"> Yes there is a setting under connections where it does not allow internet without VPN active

19:26:39 <methodman[m]2> stinkytoes there is a screenshot
19:27:02 <anonxyz[m]> Hello does anyone know how to make a new sip dialer app appear as an option for default call manager?
19:27:16 <methodman[m]2> Keep in mind though during phone start up it is recommended to be in airplane mode to avoid leakage
19:28:01 <ismellcap45[m]> You should turn on airplane mode
19:28:10 <ismellcap45[m]> Instead of switching off the mobile data
19:29:21 <methodman[m]2> <ismellcap45[m] "Instead of switching off the mob"> Huh? Were you referring to what I said? I said airplane mode
19:30:26 <ismellcap45[m]> <methodman[m]2 "Huh? Were you referring to what "> No I'm looking at your Top Notification Bar and mobile data is off of you really want to keep your "mobile data off" you should turn on airplane and only use wifi
19:31:02 <stinkytoes[m]> That‚Äôs a good thing to keep in mind! I guess my threat here is a hostile wifi network. I‚Äôll be visiting my parents and cell signal isn‚Äôt too good where they live and their ISP logs too much. Does Graphene OS have a feature to change wifi mac addresses?
19:31:23 <methodman[m]2> <ismellcap45[m] "No I'm looking at your Top Notif"> The original question was about kill switches though. I was showing to have that setting on so you are always using the VPN data
19:31:25 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: on GrapheneOS, your WiFi MAC address is random by default.
19:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: if you prefer, you can set a randomly determined MAC address specific for that network, so for instance, if you go to work and your Work Sysadmin will freak if he sees one new device joins the guest wifi every day.
19:32:14 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: I prefer the passphrase as a lock screen password. It is easier for me to type.
19:32:33 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: it is also easier for me to remember.
19:33:02 <stinkytoes[m]> <TheJollyRoger "stinkytoes: if you prefer, you c"> GrapheneOS sounds super awesome!
19:33:04 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: If you are using a VPN with GrapheneOS, you can set it with the operating system's built-in VPN functionality and set the "Always On VPN" toggle to "yes."
19:33:42 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: If you set "Always on VPN" to checked, then GrapheneOS won't allow the app to connect without first going through the VPN: "killswitches" or other theatrical effects added on after the fact are not necessary.
19:34:56 <stinkytoes[m]> Does that work with all VPNs? On iOS somethings ProtonVPN disconnects, it blocks internet while trying to connect but it the connection fails then it just lets my traffic go through.
19:35:13 <stinkytoes[m]> <TheJollyRoger "stinkytoes: If you set "Always o"> Got it. It‚Äôs a better feature then!
19:35:18 <TheJollyRoger> ismellcap45[m]: on GrapheneOS, password space has been increased from 17 characters to 64, so you can use long passphrases rather than have to rely on randomized 16 digit passwords.
19:35:25 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: yep, it is good design.
19:36:00 <stinkytoes[m]> Thanks, all!
19:36:03 <TheJollyRoger> As always, it's easier for me to remember "correct horse battery staple" than "48krE1!u*6X"
19:36:54 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: Your VPN service provider should provide the settings for you to connect.
19:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: under Settings, I want you to go to "Network & Internet -> Advanced -> VPN"
19:38:09 <TheJollyRoger> You won't see any entries there at first, but you can add one. Press the "+" in the top righthand corner of your screen.
19:38:34 <TheJollyRoger> Most VPN apps will also show up here if you install them, a few of our members have confirmed that the PIA app works here.
19:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't have an app for your VPN, tap the + and use the settings your VPN provider told you to.
19:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> As long as you check the "Always On VPN" and your VPN provider supports the correct settings for it, you can check "Block connections without VPN"
19:40:53 <TheJollyRoger> This should do it.
19:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: Hope this helps?
19:44:37 <stinkytoes[m]> Thanks! This is very helpful. I‚Äôll try this later today once I get my Pixel and GrapheneOS installed.
19:45:02 <stinkytoes[m]> Just curious, is that native support OpenVPN?
19:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> stinkytoes[m]: fantastic :). Welcome aboard the ship, shipmate!
19:46:15 <TheJollyRoger> Not sure. It does support PPTP, IPSec, IKE, L2TP and a bunch of other VPN types that OpenVPN does though.
19:46:56 <TheJollyRoger> But if I recall correctly OpenVPN uses OpenSSL for the crypto library, I don't think that's the case with Android.
19:50:05 <nullnode[m]> There is an OpenVPN app in F-Droid
19:50:48 <franken-sword-us> FWIW - just installed on Pixel 4a using Brave on MacOS Catalina -- no hiccups, seamless process....well done on the installer; used the WebUSB installer
19:53:39 <TheJollyRoger> Hey franken-sword-us, that's good to know!
19:53:42 <TheJollyRoger> nullnode[m]: Also good to know!
19:56:34 <pokimonz[m]> Is wiregaurd better than open VPN
19:57:19 <pokimonz[m]> Is always running VPN necessary?
19:57:34 <pokimonz[m]> Do you guys utilize multiple numbers on your systems?
19:57:55 <MachX[m]> <pokimonz[m] "Is wiregaurd better than open VP"> depends on your usecase
19:58:46 <MachX[m]> I believe OpenVPN can bridge ethernet segments
20:00:02 <MachX[m]> Wireguard is typically faster and more simple for just a simple tunnel into your home network. OpenVPN is definitely better for corporate remote access solution.
20:04:53 <MachX[m]> feel free to disagree with me. I'm sure you can use wireguard as a corporate remote access solution.
20:05:57 <welt[m]> Just wanted to say if there's any devs in the chat thank you and I hope you have a nice day (or night). I've heard about the crap that's been going on by a certain metal noggin company and I can relate to it (on a much smaller scale). Thank you all and I wish you the best :)
20:13:23 <TheJollyRoger> welt[m]: On behalf of the developers, it's heartwarming to hear that!
20:13:40 <pokimonz[m]> You guys are the best. Your work is very motivating wish I could help
20:14:27 <TheJollyRoger> pokimonz[m]: there are many ways you can!
20:14:36 <welt[m]> :)
20:15:31 <TheJollyRoger> The easiest way is to run the beta channel, and as soon as updates are posted, download them, use your phone for the next couple hours as heavily as you can, and reply to the github "Beta Report" threads to let us know that the update didn't break anything for you, or if it did, what it was.
20:15:56 <TheJollyRoger> Once there's enough confidence in the beta updates, then they can be marked as being stable.
20:16:26 <TheJollyRoger> Another way, is to stick around in here and be a helpful and welcoming part of the community!
20:17:07 <SRC> So if anything were to be altered in the OS the verified boot should alert you on the next reboot? Has this ever happened to anyone?
20:17:26 <madaidan[m]> metal noggin is my new favorite term
20:17:50 <madaidan[m]> It's up there with coomerhead
20:18:13 <strcat[m]> SRC: if the firmware/OS was modified in any way, it won't boot unless it can be undone
20:18:35 <pokimonz[m]> Everytime I boot it tells me I'm booting a non stock rom. Stupid question, but that's normal given that it's true? Not sure if Gos is supposed to not have a warning message
20:19:02 <strcat[m]> pokimonz: that is expected on any device not built to run GrapheneOS as the stock OS
20:19:04 <TheJollyRoger> pokimonz[m]: Yep, that's normal and expected behaviour.
20:19:18 <strcat[m]> part of the verified boot implementation
20:19:28 <strcat[m]> means it is using the key flashed to the secure element, not the hard-wired stock OS key
20:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> It's an important security feature, the yellow screen basically means "Verified boot is on and enforcing, but it's not to Google's OS."
20:19:57 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that screen turns orange and gives you this threatening message about "Software integrity is not guaranteed! Don't use this phone!" that you need to worry.
20:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> If you do get that message, then that means the bootloader has been unlocked.
20:20:58 <TheJollyRoger> You can switch bootloader unlocking back off after you've installed the OS by entering developer options, switching "OEM Unlocking" to "off" and then switching developer options back off and letting your phone reboot.
20:21:19 <MachX> hi
20:21:21 <TheJollyRoger> This way, someone will have to factory reset your phone via recovery in order to get at that toggle a second time.
20:21:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
20:21:30 <SRC> Anyone's ringer ever go on vibrate only by itself? Kinda weird, maybe I somehow did it.
20:21:42 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: sure, if the volume's turned way down.
20:22:43 <SRC> Text chime was on then about an hour later I looked at the phone and had gotten some texts and it was on silent/vibrate
21:58:16 <jurhho2> looking to completely replace traditional calling and SMS on grapheneos?
21:58:42 <jurhho2> i know certain apps like mysudo rely on google services--any suggestions?
22:00:54 <strcat[m]> Signal
22:01:00 <strcat[m]> don't use carrier-based texts and calls
22:01:18 <strcat[m]> an app-based implementation of that is still insecure carrier-based texts and calls
22:06:13 <jurhho2> signal is good for communicating with other signal users, but how about a way to call/text any number? can a softphone app like linphone work well on grapheneos with a voip service?
22:07:45 <TheJollyRoger> jurhho2: if it uses the publicly switched telephone network or something mapped to it, it's still insecure.
22:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> You can use a VOIP with linphone, but again that's just going to be connecting to the PSTN.
22:09:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> I found hushed to be decent for my needs
22:13:10 <jurhho2> thanks - high-level security is not a priority, just a way to avoid giving a real mobile number out to the public
22:14:05 <joshepete> Has anyone had issues with GrapheneOS battery saver considering sms notifications a background process, and not notifying you?
22:14:32 <jurhho2> anupritaisno1[m] -- does hushed work well without google apps and services?
22:14:36 <joshepete> I'm on the default messenger, and I only get message notifications when I open the phone
22:24:24 <strcat[m]> battery saver is for when you really need to avoid battery use at all costs
22:24:29 <strcat[m]> it's not for regular use
22:24:35 <strcat[m]> it's intended to result in that kind of bad UX
22:24:37 <strcat[m]> that's the point
22:24:41 <strcat[m]> that's why it's not the default
22:26:02 <dannyknoll3[m]> <jurhho2 "anupritaisno1 -- does hushed wor"> Watching this thread....have someone asking me about this, too
22:27:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk how you'd do that btw

23:22:43 <grapheneos_user_> If you prefer Google Maps and are OK with less privacy, you can still use it albeit less functionality even without GPlay Services.

23:25:48 <matrix_with_tele> While Magic Earth isn't available at F-Droid (only at Google Store - using AuroraStore helps), it's much better then maps.me or osmand
23:31:33 <grapheneos_user_> daimuata: Yeah it works. Just, next time, if your question isn't directly related to GrapheneOS, go to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org instead.
