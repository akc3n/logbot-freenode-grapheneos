00:05:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Alex> Literally all I do I'm this group.  Read whilst I'm "working" and make notes lol
00:12:38 <GhostSplinterSix> 🤓
00:13:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Privateer Monkey> same. love this, just for funsies reading
00:46:17 <auspiciouslink[m> Is there no way to activate grayscale mode in the Android 11 version of GrapheneOS?
00:46:17 <auspiciouslink[m> My (admittedly limited) understanding is that that feature may have moved to the "Digital Wellbeing" app in stock Android, which can normally be downloaded and made accessible through Settings, but does that mean we lose the ability to use that feature altogether?
00:46:17 <auspiciouslink[m> Or is there some other way to activate it?
00:48:27 <strcat[m]> I can't recall that ever being a feature in the base OS
00:49:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ㅤ> Greyscale gets enabled at bedtime on stock droid if I remember correctly.  Must be a setting somewhere for the entire OS to acknowledge it.
00:51:01 <auspiciouslink[m> It had been tucked under "Accessibility Features" on Android 9 and 10 and I had used it pretty extensively.
00:51:01 <auspiciouslink[m> Now I can't find it anywhere, and I think it may be because Google moved it into the Digital Wellbeing app (which includes the "Bedtime Mode" setting) and out of accessibility 😢
00:51:52 <auspiciouslink[m> Clarification: I used it on the Android 9/10 versions of GrapheneOS.
00:52:24 <b1101> "digital wellbeing" another app google just decided to make a non-removable app because fuck you
00:53:53 <auspiciouslink[m> I can move this to the off-topic room if necessary to try to find another solution, but since it was originally part of the accessibility features of the OS itself, it seemed like this was the right place to start to find out if that feature is just totally gone now.
01:02:51 <strcat[m]> I don't think it was ever part of the base OS
01:02:59 <strcat[m]> I don't think we ever had that feature
01:03:27 <auspiciouslink[m> I successfully used grayscale from the accessibility settings for almost a year on GrapheneOS.
01:05:04 <auspiciouslink[m> (I won't pretend to know if that means it was definitely "part of the base OS." All I do know is that it used to work and I used it a lot and now I can't.)
01:06:12 <auspiciouslink[m> To clarify, I didn't use "Bedtime mode." There wasn't a way to turn it on automatically on a schedule.
01:06:12 <auspiciouslink[m> But I could always go into the Accessibility settings and manually turn it on alongside the color correction modes for colorblindness, and it isn't there anymore.
01:08:31 <strcat[m]> are you sure that was on GrapheneOS and not the stock OS?
01:10:41 <strcat[m]> which device model?
01:11:02 <auspiciouslink[m> Absolutely sure. I never ran the stock OS on this device (Pixel 3a). I bought it specifically and solely to run GrapheneOS on it.
01:15:11 <strcat[m]> auspiciouslink: you can turn it on in dev options but I don't see code for more than calling out to some other package in the normal settings
01:15:17 <auspiciouslink[m> It's not the end of the world or anything for me if it's gone forever.
01:15:17 <auspiciouslink[m> I just wanted to make sure it wasn't simply that it had moved somewhere else in the settings and I couldn't find it.
01:15:32 <strcat[m]> it's simulate color space in dev options
01:16:48 <strcat[m]> auspiciouslink: I could probably easily add an option in Color correction
01:17:36 * auspiciouslink[m uploaded an image: (104KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/hKYrDYXRNbqpIGfWBflfUhdj/Screenshot_20210425-211643_1.png >
01:17:41 <auspiciouslink[m> Do you mean here?
01:17:43 <strcat[m]> Monochromacy
01:18:26 <auspiciouslink[m> I can work with that!
01:19:19 <strcat[m]> if you look at the color correction page again
01:19:21 <strcat[m]> in the regular settings
01:19:28 <strcat[m]> you can see it's just a 4th mode for that
01:19:35 <strcat[m]> try toggling it off and on
01:20:21 * auspiciouslink[m uploaded an image: (119KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uxyrqJSyTXobwVuZMFnwtAWe/Screenshot_20210425-211957.png >
01:20:34 <strcat[m]> yeah try toggling color correction on/off
01:20:43 <strcat[m]> you can see what you've done in dev options is set this to a 4th hidden setting
01:20:59 <strcat[m]> so the setting could just be added there
01:21:06 <auspiciouslink[m> Oh that's great! I can work with a hidden 4th setting!
01:21:10 <strcat[m]> auspiciouslink: I just don't see where the code would have been for an old setting
01:21:13 <auspiciouslink[m> Thank you so much for finding it!
01:21:16 <strcat[m]> I see grayscale code
01:21:25 <strcat[m]> but it just calls out to some other activity that hasn't ever been provided
01:21:59 <strcat[m]> auspiciouslink: was it a mode here?
01:22:02 <strcat[m]> or a separate option
01:22:27 <auspiciouslink[m> Yeah, that's where it used to be, and where I was sad to see it wasn't anymore.
01:22:57 <strcat[m]> was it a 4th mode there?
01:23:02 <auspiciouslink[m> Yeah
01:23:16 <strcat[m]> okay that helps me
01:23:21 <strcat[m]> I thought you meant it was a separate option
01:23:22 <auspiciouslink[m> And now I guess it's just hidden 🤷
01:23:22 <auspiciouslink[m> But it works, so I'm a happy camper 😄
01:24:01 <auspiciouslink[m> Oh, no, it was always in those accessibility settings as a color mode like the colorblindness ones.
01:24:11 <auspiciouslink[m> Same list.
01:24:29 <auspiciouslink[m> I really appreciate your help!
01:25:02 <strcat[m]> I just don't see where it would have been removed
01:26:08 <strcat[m]> history on file for the menu goes back to 2013 (features existed before)
01:27:42 <auspiciouslink[m> I enjoy using GrapheneOS a lot, but I won't pretend I know how to dig around in the code and help with that question 😅
01:27:43 <auspiciouslink[m> I'm not really sure why four options show in developer options and only three in accessibility 🤷
01:27:58 <auspiciouslink[m> Especially when the toggle in accessibility can control the 4th option.
01:42:04 <strcat[m]> auspiciouslink: are you sure you didn't use it from dev options before?
01:44:16 <strcat[m]> auspiciouslink: https://www.guidingtech.com/android-color-correction/ that's how it used to look apparently
01:45:50 <strcat> auspiciouslink[m: anyway I'll add the option so people don't have to use dev options
01:46:01 <strcat> I just don't see how the option could ever have existed before

02:32:45 <Fratzel93> Hello, at first thank you really for the effort you take in developing this project :). I have a question regarding the full disk encryption, i am using a Pixel 3a with Graphene OS. Is the security of my data the same when i boot my phone, use it and then just lock my profile instead of shutdown the phone totally? Or can the data of my apps, images
02:32:45 <Fratzel93> etc. be extracted with the help of forensic tools by 3rd partys if the profile is only locked but phone is not shutdown?
02:33:35 <Fratzel93> I am not using a 2nd profile, just put my phone away after using and when i want to use it again i have to unlock it with a passphrase.
02:42:33 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Fratzel93: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
02:43:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Plz read faq first, that goes for everyone new here, if not answered in faq then look in logs

02:53:20 <Wonderfall[m]> <Fratzel93 "Hello, at first thank you really"> GrapheneOS uses file-based encryption (not FDE), so that each profile has their encryption keys.
02:54:24 <Wonderfall[m]> > <@freenode_Fratzel93:matrix.org> Hello, at first thank you really for the effort you take in developing this project :).

02:54:24 <Wonderfall[m]>  * GrapheneOS uses file-based encryption (not FDE), so that each profile has their own encryption keys.
02:54:24 <Wonderfall[m]> Regarding your question, cold boot attack is technically possible once a profile is unlocked but this isn't viable, and very hard to do without going into the details. Note that if you use secondary profiles, ending a session would eject their keys from memory. As a rule of thumb, reboot your phone regularly and keep it powered off where you don't need it/shouldn't use it.
03:06:40 <Fratzel93> Thank you for the answers, i have read the FAQ so far and also checked the logs, but didnt found an answer to my specific question that if i only use the main profile and have it locked so i need to enter the passphrase to use the phone again, and i dont have any other profile aside, is the data secured as if i would have used a secondary profile
03:06:41 <Fratzel93> with ending the session of it?
03:06:42 <Fratzel93> I only found the info that, logically, the operating system data cant be encrypted when locking the main profile, but this doesnt affect the personal data on the main profile so the personal data is encrypted still?
03:10:10 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The option where the app is encrypted when locked depends if the app implements it. Safe option is to reboot after using the phone (this flushes the encryption key from the memory) and do not unlock until you need to use it again
03:10:58 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Oh, it was mentioned already
03:16:06 <Fratzel93> Okay, do you know if signal for example implements it? And personal data like images is also probably safe without reboot but locked? Thanks for the fast support here :)
03:32:37 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Fratzel93 "Okay, do you know if signal for "> Would need to see signal website, personal data is safe enough afaik because filesystem based encryption
03:33:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Could always reboot if you want to be careful

11:46:54 <blackmailing_fer> is GrapheneOS ready as a daily driver?
11:46:54 <blackmailing_fer> Is it a retarded Idea to install some kind of gapps? (Or MicroG?)
11:47:55 <blackmailing_fer> also: Do you feel that there is enough developer contribution for the project or are you lacking manpower?
11:47:59 <duck[m]> if you want gapps use stock
11:49:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> There are other secure roms out there which works with microG
11:50:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> No there aren't
11:51:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> I've heard of Ca"lx
11:51:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Microg itself is insecure
11:51:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> They break the security model and spread lies about how they preserve it
11:51:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> And you can go and see the endless amount of code they take from lineage along with all the weird apps they ship right into system along with microg
11:52:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> who needs cert pinning 😎
11:52:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> They also introduce Google applications into the system. It's not just a microg problem
11:52:27 <johntheripper[m]> Isn't microg optional?
11:52:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Not really
11:53:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> They ship Google applications that would constantly keep crashing if microg was absent from the system
11:53:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> It is optional there, and, https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html#microg-signature-spoofingIt isn't that bad
11:53:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> > worsens security
11:53:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> @madaidan reviewed calyx' implementation of signature spoofing and not microg itself
11:54:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> blackmailing_fer: yes, grapheneOS is a production quality OS, ready and stable to use as a daily driver
11:54:12 <johntheripper[m]> They should give users choice, if they want clean or with microg and other apps
11:54:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Microg has to be there on calyx otherwise some of the apps they add will continuously crash
11:54:25 <johntheripper[m]> That way it might suck less
11:54:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> Hmm
11:54:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> i don’t know why you would use calyx without microg
11:54:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> it’s a headline feature
11:54:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We are not shipping an insecure implementation of GMS on grapheneos
11:55:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Also a reminder that this is the grapheneos chat
11:55:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Why are you discussing about calyxos here?
11:56:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Do you go to calyxos chats and talk about grapheneos there?
12:03:11 <blackmailing_fer> OK, so my question regarding MicroG/Gapps is sufficiently answered. "We are not shipping an insecure implementation of GMS on grapheneos" sounds like clear priority on security over everything else
12:03:24 <blackmailing_fer> is GrapheneOS ready as a daily driver?
12:03:24 <blackmailing_fer> also: Do you feel that there is enough developer contribution for the project or are you lacking manpower?
12:03:37 <blackmailing_fer> thanks so far for the discussion :)
12:04:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> No it doesn't
12:05:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> You are just misrepresenting what is being said as something entirely different
12:05:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> There are many actual security issues with having microg apart from just signature spoofing
12:06:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Shipping the app in system itself can be considered breaking the security model
12:06:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We will eventually make our own implementation that pretends Google services are offline
12:16:31 <blackmailing_fer> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<clannad> Shipping the app in sy"> not sure if you are referring to what I said.
12:17:08 <blackmailing_fer> which is fine with me.
12:17:08 <blackmailing_fer> I'm just looking for more information on the status (and goals) of GrapheneOS
12:18:07 <nscnt[m]> blackmailing_ferret: Have you read what's on the website already?
12:18:16 <helloworldkk87[m> The point of GrapheneOS is max security. No compromises.
12:19:38 <blackmailing_fer> nscnt: I've been through the FAQ
12:21:43 * itsokiwantogohom  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pnPoajPBSqKiuAyYgubdgezT/message.txt >
12:22:11 <itsokiwantogohom> * Daily driver, absolutely. If you don't use apps where GMS is essential. Essential as in the app would not work or crash without it. Many apps use GMS for push notifications. If you can live without push notifications or if there are non-GMS versions available, you're fine.
12:24:07 <itsokiwantogohom> <itsokiwantogohom "> <@blackmailing_ferret:matrix.o"> You can install GApps. If they work without Google Play services, ypu can use them. If not, as was mentioned, do not use microG. Which GApps are essential to you anyways? Can you replace them?
12:24:50 <itsokiwantogohom> * You can install GApps. If they work without Google Play services, you can use them. If not, as was mentioned, do not use microG. Which GApps are essential to you anyways? Can you replace them?
12:24:50 <itsokiwantogohom> Sorry, this is probably for offtopic chat.
12:28:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> @oleanderxoxo1 That's referring to Calyx's restrictions on signature spoofing which is less bad than some other implementations but doesn't completely negate the attack surface of microG / signature spoofing.
12:28:44 <souvlaki[m]> what's the point of installing Graphene if you want to use GApps?
12:29:19 <rridley[m]> i dont know if it is, i mean security is all about compromise and graphene takes a very uncompromising stance on security vs convenience
12:29:49 <rridley[m]> if that uncompromising stance doesn't fit well in your model then it's probably not for you
12:30:08 <souvlaki[m]> yep, that's exactly how it works
12:35:29 <nscnt[m]> You can use GrapheneOS as you like
12:36:34 <souvlaki[m]> basically, what i like about GrapheneOS is that it takes no shit
12:36:53 <souvlaki[m]> no shady GSF implementations, no compromises
12:38:13 <souvlaki[m]> so yes, the point is if you want to use google services - don't use microg, use stock Android rom
12:38:17 <nscnt[m]> ﻿blackmailing_ferret: Each version is tested internally, then moved to the beta channel and then to the stable channel. The project has been in active development for more than half a decade. I think that should speak for its "readiness"? There are 2 full-time developers and many part-time contributors. Help is generally always welcome
12:38:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> Hmm, less bad. Does it makes it insecure? How exactly if I may ask
12:39:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> You can answer me in DM if you not here as it is a Graphene chat not Caylx chat
12:39:21 <blackmailing_fer> thanks for the discussion so far!
12:39:21 <blackmailing_fer> I have to think through my phone usage with that in mind and see whether or not I can live without GMS
12:39:21 <blackmailing_fer> It might very well be the case that i'll be onboard Graphene soon :)
12:39:45 <blackmailing_fer> I'll be sure to drop an adequate donation when things work out :)
12:40:00 <blackmailing_fer> I'll think through my usage first :)
12:40:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​leanderxoxo1> I think you can, I am also living without GMS/GApps from last 3 years 😉
12:41:19 <rridley[m]> yeah i pretty much only use open source apps
12:41:31 <souvlaki[m]> same, never had any troubles since i use foss alternatives
12:42:08 <souvlaki[m]> and for the bs i can't avoid like slack, only notifications don't work as they rely on GSF
12:42:49 <nscnt[m]> blackmailing_ferret: You can always revert to the stock OS or whatever you prefer if GrapheneOS isn't for you (assuming you'd still like to use the Pixel you bought, even if it's not GrapheneOS)
12:43:53 <somenerd[m]> > what's the point of installing Graphene if you want to use GApps?
12:43:53 <somenerd[m]> A secure and private OS?
12:44:07 <somenerd[m]> The reason that GApps aren't insalled are because they have high privilege
12:44:19 <somenerd[m]> within the system
12:44:27 <somenerd[m]> so it's a problem, both security and privacy wise
12:44:39 <somenerd[m]> same reason why microg isn't included
12:45:25 <somenerd[m]> if Google allowed installation of GApps without deep integration into OS, and without special perms, GrapheneOS could theoretically allow it
12:45:34 <somenerd[m]> but this is highly unlikely
12:46:07 <somenerd[m]> actually, they probably won't at all
12:46:08 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services
12:46:22 <souvlaki[m]> isn't it true that if GApps is a stopper, the only way to enable needed functionality is installing stock Google rom?
12:46:41 <covid-1984[m]> <souvlaki[m] "what's the point of installing G"> You can't differentiate between an App being a private or security risk and an entire OS being one?
12:46:52 <covid-1984[m]> > <@souvlaki:privacytools.io> what's the point of installing Graphene if you want to use GApps?
12:46:53 <covid-1984[m]>  * You can't differentiate between an App being a privacy or security risk and an entire OS being one?
12:46:56 <somenerd[m]> stock is the best way to guarantee compatibility, yes
12:47:00 <souvlaki[m]> which has *enough* security by default (not privacy)
12:47:14 <somenerd[m]> > You can't differentiate between an App being a privacy or security risk and an entire OS being one?
12:47:14 <somenerd[m]> I mean, GApps are integrated into the OS, soooo
12:47:26 <somenerd[m]> they can't be installed without integration afaik
12:47:40 <souvlaki[m]> <covid-1984[m] "You can't differentiate between "> stock android isn't much of a security risk tho
12:47:53 <somenerd[m]> > Ideally, Google themselves would support installing the official Play services as a regular Android app, rather than taking the monopolistic approach of forcing it to be bundled into the OS in a deeply integrated way with special privileged permissions and capabilities unavailable to other service providers competing with them.
12:48:01 <somenerd[m]> (from the section that I linked)
12:48:15 <covid-1984[m]> <souvlaki[m] "stock android isn't much of a se"> It is just an empty statement...
12:48:17 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS won't include Google services
12:49:40 <souvlaki[m]> <covid-1984[m] "It is just an empty statement..."> do you see hundreds of CVEs with PoC published every day with huge exploitation in the wild rates?
12:49:57 <covid-1984[m]> Straw man argument
12:50:08 <covid-1984[m]> That isn't even an argument
12:50:14 <covid-1984[m]> Not taking the bait
12:50:28 <somenerd[m]> this is an offtopic discussion, suggest moving to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
12:51:22 <nscnt[m]> and be nice
12:52:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah
13:38:08 <Guest19270> How long can you use a GrapheneOS phone before it wears out somehow and you have to buy a new phone?
13:40:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's in the FAQ https://grapheneos.org/faq#legacy-devices
13:41:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Also here https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
13:41:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <k​evinpigar> Did the last update drain the battery on pixel 5? i got -50% in a morning when I usually get -20
13:42:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Something else cause this most probably
13:42:43 <rny> 3-ish years from day0 of release
13:43:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <k​evinpigar> It says telegram but I use telegram FOSS and no updates
13:43:11 <somenerd[m]> I think they meant just wear and tear, not just updates
13:43:24 <Guest19270> Ah ok
13:43:51 <Guest19270> <somenerd[m] "I think they meant just wear and"> I mean the updates are important too
13:44:07 <rny> wear and tear questions are impossible to answer
13:44:10 <Guest19270> Wear and tear probably depends on how gently I treat the charger port
13:44:17 <somenerd[m]> yeah, for updates, 3 years
13:44:20 <somenerd[m]> > wear and tear questions are impossible to answer
13:44:20 <somenerd[m]> agreed
14:27:04 <faxing[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> to install GrapheneOS us"> Sorry, I didn't know -- I'd hardly call it "spreading misinformation", though
14:27:06 <faxing[m]> Sorry either way.
15:16:24 <polardroid> good morning, any special drivers needed for c to ethernet adaptors?
15:32:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW just a moderator warning here. Don't discuss about microg or calyx here
15:33:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why? Because the information about microg is already covered by our FAQ and this is the grapheneos chat
15:34:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Further in this specific case I have evidence that at least one person was arguing in bad faith. I'm not going to take any names since but the next time they do so they are out of here
15:34:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> I would advise stopping further discussion to avoid feeding trolls here
15:35:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Further in this specific case I have evidence that at least one person was arguing in bad faith. I'm not going to take any names but the next time they do so they are out of here
15:35:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> * I would advise stopping further discussion about these topics to avoid feeding trolls here
15:37:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> souvlaki: since when did CVEs become a measure of security?
15:38:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> CVEs are just a measure how many people are looking at the code
15:38:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't say much about the security of the software
15:39:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> souvlaki: grapheneos has far better security and privacy than the stock ROM. I don't know what you're trying to prove here
15:40:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "same reason why microg isn't inc"> Microg is a privileged system app with poor security practices in many cases. We wanted to ship it as a user app to reduce the attack surface but even then it is terrible
15:41:09 <alwaysr[m]> Turned of GPS, fused location uses battery what is fused location?
15:41:40 <souvlaki[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "souvlaki: grapheneos has far bet"> i'm not trying to prove that graphene has weaker security, i'm trying to prove that if you want to use google services, you should use roms with google services
15:41:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> The problem with GMS is not only the invasiveness but also that we'd lose out on a lot of hardening features just trying to add GMS into grapheneos
15:42:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <nscnt[m] "﻿blackmailing_ferret: Each versi"> I would say more than a decade now
15:42:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <rridley[m] "i dont know if it is, i mean sec"> We are not taking any uncompromising stance. Wtf
15:43:22 <somenerd[m]> An uncompromising stance would probably do a lot more security hardening
15:43:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> rridley: we don't do anything to break your apps. If the apps rely on play services that's something the developer needs to deal with
15:43:55 <somenerd[m]> (no third-party apks, for example)
15:46:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "(no third-party apks, for exampl"> Glassrom P edition says hi
15:46:05 <somenerd[m]> yes
16:45:30 <p0lp0> is there an additional step i need to take in order to get grapheneOS to work with Intune?
16:46:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> No. Are you having issues?
16:46:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Microg is a privileged system app with poor security practices. We wanted to ship it as a user app to reduce the attack surface but even then it is terrible
16:47:25 <p0lp0> anupritaisno1[m], sure am. failing a 'basic integrity check' and 'certified device check'
16:48:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's something to do with google play services
16:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should contact Microsoft for that
16:49:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basic integrity is a field in safetynet attestation
16:49:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> And CTS profile match is another
16:49:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Those are implemented by google apps
16:49:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Which we don't have
16:49:58 <p0lp0> weird. i would have assumed it was something i missed in the config
16:50:17 <p0lp0> i don't have any google play svcs installed. this is in a fresh user profile
17:07:58 <strcat[m]> p0lp0: they're trying to use Play services software attestation APIs that are not present
17:08:01 <strcat[m]> report the problem to them
17:08:22 <strcat[m]> they should use hardware-based attestation directly when available if they want to do that, and nothing stops them from adding the GrapheneOS keys
17:08:25 <strcat[m]> please report app problems to app developers
17:08:32 <strcat[m]> absolutely nothing we can do about app deficiencies like that
18:13:00 <Holo87> Absolute newbie here. I have questions:
18:14:53 <Holo87> 1. How to install apps without Play store - where to get them?  2. How to uninstall Graphene and reinstall Android
18:15:18 <GhostSplinterSix> <Holo87 "Absolute newbie here. I have que"> I'm fairly new myself. Have you browsed the website especially the FAQS section?
18:17:54 <Holo87> Thanks for reply. Yes, I have read the website carefully "Loads of apps" it says, but no info on where to get them. No info on uninstalling - possibly reset the phone, if that ability is still available after Graphene is installed.
18:20:25 <Jacobsin[m]> fdroid is a good place to get apps.
18:21:07 <GhostSplinterSix> https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
18:22:18 <GhostSplinterSix> https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft
18:28:04 <Holo87> Thanks, I'll try fdroid.
18:28:32 <nscnt[m]> Holo87: The installation of the stock OS works the same way as the installation of GrapheneOS

18:29:02 <nscnt[m]> https://flash.android.com/welcome
18:29:53 <Holo87> GhostSplinterSix - I have previously read those FAQs - bundled apps does not have a list of the apps, and anti-theft explains why Graphene doesn't have a reset function
18:33:09 <Holo87> nscnt[m]  Thank you - now I know what "the stock OS" means!
18:33:33 <nscnt[m]> Holo87: What reset function? You can factory reset GrapheneOS
18:38:50 <skwisgaar[m]> Holo87: if you are looking for play store apps, aurora store is a good option
18:42:27 <Holo87> nscnt[m] That's reassuring. I have a Pixel 2 I'm not using, so I might give it a try.
18:46:06 <bluebird> unlocking the phone using ones face is quite convenient, but is there a way to quickly lock it more securely so it would require the same password as at startup?
18:47:11 <Holo87> Thanks everyone for your help... I have to leave now.
18:48:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> bluebird: long press power button -> Lockdown
18:49:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is AOSP feature
18:49:19 <nscnt[m]> ^ needs to be enabled first
18:50:49 <nscnt[m]> Settings > Display > Lock screen > Show lockdown option
18:52:44 <bluebird> thanks!
18:59:51 <GhostSplinterSix> <Holo87 "GhostSplinterSix - I have previo"> All good. I was mainly sharing those two links since one mentions F-Droid and Aurora for downloading apps and the other mentions factory reset. 👍
19:01:04 <GhostSplinterSix> Oh. They left. 😆 I was on my way out the door to head home when they first sent a message in here.
19:17:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> csagan5: thanks for all your work on Bromite
21:13:08 <yourfinger> Unlocked Pixel 3  - trying to use the Web installer, on the fastboot screen, connected to (driver updated) laptop, clicked on "Unlock Bootloader" button, it connects to the Pixel3, but gives a timepout error then "Error: Bootloader was not unlocked, please try again!" - which does not work....Help
21:20:28 <Pratyush[m]> you mean you bought "Unlocked Pixel 3"?
21:20:28 <Pratyush[m]> Few question did you enabled oem unlocking from developer option?
21:20:43 <Pratyush[m]> do you see any prompt on your mobile screen ?
21:25:19 <yourfinger> yes. bought unlocked Pixel 3. in developer options the "OEM Unlocking" is greyed out. it will not let me access it. and  prompt on my mobile screen? no?
21:34:19 <metacrisis[m]> <yourfinger "yes. bought unlocked Pixel 3. in"> Means it was likely from Verizon and can't be flashed unfortunately
21:36:40 <yourfinger> ? help me understand why please.. i understand what you are saying, but why verizon..... i bought it on woot. your probably correct. but how do i move forward from here?

22:03:42 <doktorzhivago[m]> <yourfinger "? help me understand why please."> https://www.wikihow.com/Unlock-a-Verizon-Phone
22:04:27 <doktorzhivago[m]> Sounds like if it was not reported stolen you can unlock
22:10:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> doktorzhivago: he left
22:11:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * doktorzhivago: thats network unlocking
22:11:43 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What matters is bootloader unlocking
22:12:54 <doktorzhivago[m]> Ah, sorry for the disinfo
22:14:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <doktorzhivago[m] "Ah, sorry for the disinfo"> You're fine
22:14:54 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Easy mistake to make, especially when people sell locked phones as unlocked and waste people's money...grrr
22:17:43 <doktorzhivago[m]> That is super annoying, Verizon will not unlock a phone like that?
22:24:04 <GhostSplinterSix> Hm...I'd be curious to know the answer to that.
22:25:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> [redacted] (@P​residentjoe) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:27:45 <bizanon[m]> I realized that max number of profiles you can have is 16. Is there a reason for this limit?
23:31:08 <IPFreely> 1 byte is 8 bits, so it would appear that someone has allocated 2 bytes to the profiles functionality. There were no more bytes left to give. :p
23:32:49 <bizanon[m]> So is it not possible to increase the limit? IPFreely
23:34:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> The limit is increased
23:34:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> AOSP has a lower limit on max number of profiles
