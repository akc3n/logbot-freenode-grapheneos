01:44:28 <squarmkt[m]> Anyone have an error, where if you go into a secondary profile and open an app that gives a no gapps installed message crashes if you don't hit okay the first time. It then shut the phone down and then on first restart went into recovery, but booted when I just said start normally
01:50:05 <akc3n> Hi squarmkt[m] just a quick fyi, as per rule 2a for the channel/room's rules (located in the topic for your convenience). Your question perhaps is better suited for #grapheneos-offtopic. "Apps, service providers, or protocols that don't come with GrapheneOS. Services such as mail, messaging, and cloud storage services, are outside of GrapheneOS control and off-topic."
01:51:49 <squarmkt[m]> Since it crashed the os and caused it to go into recovery, I thought it'd be better suited here, but I'll put it over there

05:57:21 <akanepal[m]> Hi, I'm having an issue where the mouse pointer disappears in landscape orientation. I can still click and scroll, but the pointer is invisible. Am I the only one with this issue? I'm on a 3a XL. I've tried other mice, rebooting ...

06:01:50 <depechesilence[m> Should I worry? Its just condensation
06:12:22 <Cliff[m]> <depechesilence[m "Screenshot_20210511-070131.png"> I had this once a while ago, it disappeared after something like an hour.
06:13:07 <depechesilence[m> <Cliff[m] "I had this once a while ago, it "> Ah I see. Okay. So it maybe coincidence. It didn't go near liquid if at all condensation due to heat
06:13:36 <Cliff[m]> For me it was moist from my hand after wearing gloves lol
06:15:18 <depechesilence[m> Is the 4a supposed to be a bit warm when playing loud music? Always had it.
06:17:25 <depechesilence[m> Anyway it'll be in my pocket for the next 7 hours so good luck Pixel
06:18:02 <Cliff[m]> Dont know about that, i did notice pixel has great audio en double speaker. I can feel my screen vibrate if i turn up the volume.
06:18:11 <depechesilence[m> I can too
06:18:51 <depechesilence[m> How are you today Cliff?
06:19:56 <Cliff[m]> Good, just starting my day i have to go now

06:35:58 <covid-1984[m]> You guys have any idea how YouTube knows what country a SIM card is from? I'm pretty sure I didn't watch YT vids in Vanadium over LTE - but I might have. Anyway, I had a SIM in from another country for a day or so - and now all YouTube video ads are in that language/for that country :P I don't really care; just a curious phenomenon.
06:36:49 <covid-1984[m]> strcat: I'm curious if you think (some of the) improvements you made to Vanadium could be added to ungoogled-chromium (by their maintainers).
07:15:49 <somenerd[m]> I'm not sure if they have the same goals
07:15:53 <somenerd[m]> offtopic discussion though.
07:24:02 <somenerd[m]> also I believe that the security of Vanadium partially depends on other enhancements within the OS

15:38:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hi there
15:39:11 <the0n3> i have a few questions?
15:39:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> check the rules before asking)
15:39:42 <the0n3> i am building graphene and want to change the boot image, is this possible?
15:40:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, but you would need to build it yourself
15:40:24 <the0n3> huhh where are the rules to read them.
15:40:40 <the0n3> i am building it by meself
15:40:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
15:41:14 <the0n3> i have build already but can"t find flash-all.sh?
15:41:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, this is the building guide https://grapheneos.org/build
15:42:11 <the0n3> i have already read the build guides, but its little bit confusing for me.
15:43:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this is where my knowledge ends, unfortunately. please wait for someone else to help you
15:44:45 <the0n3> okay i will wait
15:45:19 <the0n3> but it is possible to create my own boot image, when building my own graphene os?
15:48:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, it is possible
15:50:56 <the0n3> can I send a screenshot on this chat?
15:51:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> jpg or png are fine
15:51:19 <the0n3> png
15:51:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> go for it
15:51:33 <the0n3> how do i upload them?
15:52:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> idk, i've never used IRC
15:52:23 <the0n3> okay

17:14:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> guys, my second-hand pixel 4 xl just arrived. but the microphone doesn't work. is there any way for me to fix it or replace the mic?
17:16:31 <floralshoppe[m]1> anyone use a tap to pay app on their graphene phone?
17:17:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> As a temporary work around you can use a bluetooth headset. The mic can probably be replaced. You might try flashing the stock firmware to see if it fixes anything the previous user may have screwed up.
17:18:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> i just updated to android11 but the problem still persists. i think it's hardware-related. so I'll probably have to replace the mic.
17:19:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> but i don't even know where the microphone is located 😩
17:20:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <p​otat_o> I would be very surprised if there aren't "breakdown" videos on youtube for your phone
17:24:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Look after Tiny holes in your frame
17:48:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​tlantistux> Hi, I'm planning to buy a Google Pixel but I'm hesitating between the Pixel 4A 5G and the Pixel 4A, I would like to know if there is anyone among you who has these 2 models under GrapheneOS and if there is a difference in the general performance of the phone
17:51:51 <rawtaz> i use 4a, neer touched 4a 5G
17:51:54 <rawtaz> never*
17:52:08 <rawtaz> what performance do you need or are you concerned about?
17:54:22 <rawtaz> even if the 5G is faster it's also much bigger and therefore cant be handled properly, causing you slowdowns that mitigate any performance benefit :-)
17:54:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​tlantistux> I want to keep my phone as long as possible, and I am afraid that in 4 - 5 years I will feel the first slowdowns ^^"
17:55:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​tlantistux> Maybe the snapdragon 765G will last longer
17:59:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​tlantistux> Another question, are there differences on the speed of the opening of certain applications between these 2 models (4A and 4A 5G) under GrapheneOS ?
18:27:59 <Rob12> hey I flashed grapheneos on my Pixel 4a. followed the install guide. after the flashing and locking the device again I can't start it. "no valid slot to boot" any suggestions? thank you for your help
18:38:45 <rawtaz> odd. is there any part of the installation instructions that you could have made a mistake on?
18:41:46 <Rob12> well, I don't know.
18:48:30 <rluch[m]> hello. I'm attempting to install on my 4a 4g using web installer from ubuntu 20.04 in Google Chrome. At the flashing factory images step phone is stuck in fastbootd menu and browser says "Error: Unable to claim interface.". Since I already bricked one 4a my pride and economy would like your opinion on how to proceed :) thanks
18:53:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rluch[m]: hello! are you on a live-USB?
18:54:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Rob12: hi, try starting from the beginning
18:55:17 <rluch[m]> @!Hulk Nope. Running Ubuntu as my primary OS on a X1 with plenty of (free) ram and disk :)
18:56:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rluch[m]: does your PC come with USB C port?
18:57:34 <rluch[m]> Yes. It is connected with USB-C in both ends.
18:57:37 <rawtaz> flashing a mobile phone firmware using one's web browser seems a bit outrageous :-)
18:58:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rawtaz: Google does the same https://flash.android.com/
18:58:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rluch[m]: have you set the udev rules properly?
19:01:46 <rluch[m]> @!Hulk I believe so. I installed the android-sdk-platform-tools-common package and rebooted afterwards.
19:01:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> keep in mind that you only get ~3 years of updates
19:02:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rluch[m]: make sure there is no other program that might interfere
19:03:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> adb can sometimes interfere with the installation
19:04:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en
19:04:40 <rluch[m]> @!Hulk thanks! I will try again after a fresh PC reboot, with nothing open besides Chrome. How do you suggest I proceed with the phone? I have several options in fastbootd, amongst them reboot sys and reboot to bootloader
19:05:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, you just don't touch your phone
19:06:22 <rluch[m]> @!Hulk Thanks a bunch! Should I just retry the "Flashing factory images" after reboot?
19:06:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
19:06:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you better-off to start at unlocking the bootloader
19:07:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> doing these steps twice is ok, and might fix the first attempt
19:08:39 <rluch[m]> Awesome. I will not touch the phone, reboot PC and start from unlock bootloader step. Thanks a bunch!! I will be back with results shortly 😇
19:10:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sure, keep us posted 👍
19:12:43 <rawtaz> Hulk: yeah and it's still madness :D it's like changing tyres on your car using your fridge ;)
19:12:57 <rawtaz> it CAN be done, it's just not kosher
19:13:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you might have a point rawtaz)
19:14:16 <rawtaz> :D
19:21:29 <rluch[m]> @!Hulk you are an absolute life (and money) saver! I successfully completed the flash and bootloader locking step! I am extremely appreciative and can't wait to get going with graphene! For privacy!! Thanks to all of you
19:22:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rluch[m]: welcome aboard!
19:23:22 <rluch[m]> rawtaz:  I partly agree as well, why I chose CLI (as the 1337 h4x0r I saw my self as). Distractions and ill preparation left me with a bricked phone, whereas the web version worked very well, and with help from !Hulk I just hit the goal 😂
19:26:04 <rawtaz> rluch[m]: ah you did the web one? nice. im surprised your first one is bricked though, i thought the basic boot loader stuff was always workable, isnt there like two copies of it so if you mess up one the other one still works, or something like that?
19:26:48 <rawtaz> really nicely guided by Hulk
19:29:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rawtaz: there is only one bootloader
19:30:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> iirc, flashing a wrong image permanently bricks there phone (because of the partition table??)
19:30:30 <rawtaz> hm ok
19:30:36 <rawtaz> too bad :<
19:31:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> System update using A/B is a different thing
19:31:04 <rluch[m]> Indeed. I decided to take no chances this time around, and Hulks guidance was fast and magnificent. I flashed the wrong version first time around, entirely my own fault, although the online instructions could perhaps be better tailored for not-so-thoroughly-reading people like me.
19:38:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> my previous message is wrong. correction: flashing a wrong image permanently bricks the phone, but, afaik, because the firmware gets replaced
19:44:40 <rluch[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> my previous message is w"> Is the only recovery option to have it replaced?
19:45:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> replace the whole phone? I think yes
19:46:10 <rluch[m]> Thanks. I figured as well. Still worth a shot :)

20:03:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Are you using the web-installer?
20:05:05 <Foxtrek_64[m]> <Usersk "Hello everyone. May I ask for in"> Don't ask to ask. Just ask.
20:05:59 <Usersk>  I have a problem at the very beginning. The bootloader is not unlocked via the web installer
20:06:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Have you enabled the OEM unlocking?
20:06:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#enabling-oem-unlocking
20:07:50 <Usersk> Yes. But my browsers do not see the device. Win10
20:08:42 <Usersk> Fastboot - is this the correct mode?
20:08:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Make sure you have the necessary drivers https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
20:10:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Does your PC come with USB-C port
20:10:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ?
20:10:48 <Usersk> no, only USB3
20:11:52 <Usersk> what driver is needed for the google pixel? yellow exclamation mark is lit
20:12:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I recommend you to use a different host
20:12:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Do you have any other computers nearby?
20:12:37 <Usersk> most likely this is the case
20:12:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> An Android phone with a USB-C port would do
20:12:58 <Usersk> not another computers
20:13:19 <Usersk> android phone maybe
20:13:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Try it using an Android phone
20:14:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Use the Google's cable to connect them
20:16:08 <Usersk> and if i install driver for Google Pixel BootLoader Interface
20:16:14 <Usersk> &
20:16:19 <Usersk> ?
20:34:22 <rawtaz> oh yeah, that matrix thing is working that well again. lol
20:37:04 <trttl> nice
