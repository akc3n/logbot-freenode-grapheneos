00:10:56 <alex-resist> I do not need Play services for anything so I'm just an observer
00:11:57 <alex-resist> Apps that require play services are not really trying anyway, so I don't really care about them
00:13:05 <alex-resist> People who need them can just switch to "the other" OS and they'll be fine probably
00:36:23 <strcat[m]> I'm updating the section on the site
00:36:28 <strcat[m]> to better explain the new plan
00:36:46 <strcat[m]> which is essentially just that we are choosing a specific one of those 2  approaches and not doing the other one
00:51:59 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services has been updated to remove one of the 2 planned approaches and to expand details on the chosen approach
00:52:28 <strcat[m]> > We're developing a minimal Play services compatibility layer as a regular app without any special privileges. The app will provide a stub implementation of the entire Play services API pretending the servers are down and the functionality is unavailable. It will always be disabled by default since apps will detect Play services is available and will try to use it rather than alternatives. As an example, Signal would
00:52:28 <strcat[m]> try to use a non-functional FCM implementation rather than their own server push implementation. The intention is that users will only enable this in profiles dedicated to running apps with an unnecessary hard dependency on Play services. We'll likely prevent enabling it in the owner profile to help users avoid those kinds of pitfalls.
00:52:30 <k68> hi all! working through graphene installation to pixel 4a via web ui...hit a snag while attempting to unlock bootloader. Have fastboot installed on Windows 10, USB C cable recognizing phone...but modal launched by graphene web page "unlock bootloader" button tells me "no compatible device found"
00:52:34 <strcat[m]> > Our Play services app won't have any special privileges or whitelisting in the OS like Play services or microG. There will be no support for bypassing arbitrary signature checks like the microG signature spoofing patch since it substantially compromises the OS security model and breaks other security features like verified boot. Instead, our app will be signed with a GrapheneOS Play services key and the only OS
00:52:34 <strcat[m]> support for the app will be presenting the GrapheneOS Play services key as the Google Play services key.
00:52:36 <k68> any thoughts/experience on this hiccup?
00:52:51 <strcat[m]> k68: https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
00:52:52 <k68> also, am I in the right channel to ask? yell at me if not :)
00:52:57 <strcat[m]> k68: make sure to do this with Windows Update
00:53:03 <strcat[m]> after connecting it in the bootloader interface mode
00:53:53 <k68> strcat[m] tx for the answer...not clear on advice.
00:54:03 <k68> Run Windows Update? Is that the advice?
00:54:15 <k68> And thanks for the link...that is the install page I'm trying to use
00:55:43 <k68> ...
01:00:25 <KEI[m]1> @strcat:matrix.org: yt?
01:00:52 <strcat[m]> KEI: read the 2nd paragraph in https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
01:00:59 <strcat[m]> > On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot. You can obtain this via the Windows Update optional updates if you don't already have it.
01:01:12 <KEI[m]1> right tx
01:01:24 <KEI[m]1> so, I believe I have fastboot installed...but thanks for the advice, i'll try again
01:01:24 <strcat[m]> I could reorder some stuff to make it clearer how to do this
01:01:28 <KEI[m]1> lol
01:01:33 <KEI[m]1> hey, it's pretty clear imo
01:01:41 <KEI[m]1> i'm assuming error between user and keyboard on my part
01:02:04 <strcat[m]> KEI: you aren't supposed to install any software but rather go into Windows Update after connecting the phone
01:02:04 <KEI[m]1> guess i'll just run all the win updates and see if that address it
01:02:09 <strcat[m]> and go to optional updates
01:02:12 <KEI[m]1> ah
01:02:18 <strcat[m]> and install the bootloader interface driver it shows
01:02:21 <KEI[m]1> okay then, yeah that wasn't clear
01:02:22 <KEI[m]1> thanks!
01:02:29 <KEI[m]1> so bring up Win Update in settings after connecting
01:02:37 <strcat[m]> and go to optional updates in there
01:02:38 <KEI[m]1> and then, to be explicit: what do i see there?
01:02:40 <KEI[m]1> ok
01:04:04 <KEI[m]1> so, seeing a series of op updates: Bluetooth, net, System, and a feature update v20H2 which I assume is a rollup
01:04:13 <KEI[m]1> advice is to just install all and see what flies?
01:04:51 <KEI[m]1> or should i be seeing a fastboot labeled update?
01:09:42 <bethefriction[m]> Can you enter developer mode on another profile user?
01:10:13 <bethefriction[m]> I tried and it won't let me but not sure if there is a work around
01:12:38 <bethefriction[m]> I'm trying to connect and access files from a USB in another profile but need to access developer mode to enable USB file transfer
01:12:48 <strcat[m]> enable it in the owner profile
01:12:54 <strcat[m]> you can then use adb
01:12:55 <bethefriction[m]> It is
01:13:06 <strcat[m]> so you should be able to use adb regardless of which profile is active
01:13:21 <strcat[m]> the owner profile is in charge of setting up those kinds of global settings
01:13:30 <strcat[m]> commands like `pm` have a user parameter
01:13:32 <bethefriction[m]> OK let me double check what I have enabled
01:15:41 <KEI[m]1> <strcat[m] "and go to optional updates in th"> Thanks! Understood the flow, totally worked. Appreciate the explanation
01:16:04 <KEI[m]1> Didn't realize I needed to launch Unlock Bootloader modal, keep open, before visiting Optional Updates
01:16:11 <KEI[m]1> My muddle :)
01:16:16 <KEI[m]1> Amped for Graphene, tx again
01:16:16 <strcat[m]> KEI: you don't need to keep it open like that
01:16:31 <strcat[m]> KEI: the device just needs to be plugged in while in the bootloader interface mode and then the optional update should show up
01:16:38 <strcat[m]> the browser doesn't have to be involved yet
01:16:38 <KEI[m]1> cool
01:16:39 <KEI[m]1> did work
01:16:40 <KEI[m]1> tx
01:17:14 <KEI[m]1> fyi: the web page ui is slick. while i could do command line, this is super quick. tx for all those who put it together
01:19:10 <borisdpython> howdy folks...any suggestions on a different build I can use this GrapheneOS is not going to work for me..really cool concept, too barebones...
01:19:32 <borisdpython> I feel like I got my phone onto an island I can't get off of now
01:19:35 <bethefriction[m]> So in my USB settings I have file transfer enabled. But that isn't working to access in other profiles. Should I be selecting another option?
01:36:32 <bethefriction[m]> I tried every setting under USB configuration but nothing allows me to access USB in another profile.
01:39:12 <akrugosei[m]> <borisdpython "I feel like I got my phone onto "> Lmfao - sounds like stock Android is more for you then
01:40:35 <bethefriction[m]> <borisdpython "howdy folks...any suggestions on"> Have you tried CalyxOS?
02:00:50 <strcat[m]> bethefriction: please don't promote that here
02:02:54 <strcat[m]> bethefriction: every time you connect the device to a computer, you need to change the mode from charge only to the desired mode, same as with AOSP / stock Android
02:03:26 <strcat[m]> bethefriction: the USB peripherals setting we add inside the Settings app is an unrelated thing for connecting peripherals to the phone
02:04:14 <strcat[m]> bethefriction: the mode you choose when using the phone as a peripheral itself is not something persistent but rather each time you want to do that, you have to select the desired mode
02:04:23 <strcat[m]> same as stock/AOSP
02:04:41 <strcat[m]> you plug in the phone to a computer and select file transfer instead of charge only
02:05:21 <strcat[m]> it's not a setting that's saved, it's a choice for the current connection only
02:25:54 <rny> strcat[m]: have you considered just applying for ARIN membership and just outright maintaining an AS for graphene os?
02:26:25 <louipc> what
02:26:32 <rny> no more ip blacklisting shenenigans and can control your own routing :P
02:27:03 <rny> i envy ARIN membership, it cheap, compared to APNIC
02:28:58 <louipc> is there .os tld?
02:29:48 <louipc> nope
02:29:59 <rny> DNS names are IANA
02:30:14 <rny> this is specific only to internetworking.
02:30:54 <louipc> i mean that would be another cool thing to have lol
02:30:57 <rny> huge price and effort just to avoid ip blacklisting :/
02:31:00 <louipc> full control over a tld

02:43:52 <hasnoname[m]> Is it normal to be able to skip initial login screen after reboot?
02:46:13 <Lighwake[m]> Happened to me a few times. Not sure why exactly tho.
02:48:18 <Lighwake[m]> Maybe because you have multiple users turned on.
02:48:23 <hasnoname[m]> <Lighwake[m] "Happened to me a few times. Not "> I remember this feature from nexus 6p and some other phone. But this login comes way before in the boot process.
02:49:13 <Lighwake[m]> I saw a setting "use one PIN" or something like that. That should fix that.
02:50:18 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: don't see anything being skipped
02:50:51 <strcat[m]> doesn't look like GrapheneOS
02:51:42 <strcat[m]> not GrapheneOS
02:52:01 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "doesn't look like GrapheneOS"> Oh no, it is gos
02:52:25 <strcat[m]> 1) nothing is being skipped, 2) not GrapheneOS (or at least not *current* GrapheneOS)
02:52:25 <hasnoname[m]> I can may be send another video showing the logo
02:52:33 <strcat[m]>  * 1) nothing is being skipped, 2) not GrapheneOS (or at least not _current_ GrapheneOS)
02:52:54 <strcat[m]>  * 1) nothing is being skipped, 2) not GrapheneOS (or at least not current GrapheneOS)
02:53:00 <Lighwake[m]> It did happen to me once or twice. Maybe the update fixed it.
02:53:10 <strcat[m]> nothing is being skipped
02:53:29 <strcat[m]> I can tell that's not a (recent) release of GrapheneOS too
02:54:07 <strcat[m]> I don't understand the claim that something is being skipped
02:54:45 <rny> he probably meant whats with a different keyguard UI displaying
02:54:57 <strcat[m]> that's not anything being skipped
02:55:02 <strcat[m]> that's the OS completing loading of more stuff
02:55:04 <take_a_deep_brea> me too . dont understand . and the initial PIN UI is not even recent aosp if i remember correctly
02:55:17 <rny> agreed, nothing is being skipped.
02:55:26 <strcat[m]> yeah that is not (current) GrapheneOS
02:55:33 <rny> that being said, i dont know why a different keyboard display appeared
02:55:38 <rny> i have never seen that happen on my phone
02:55:38 <strcat[m]> so either it's not GrapheneOS, or it's a very old version of it
02:55:46 <rny> *keyguard
02:55:48 <strcat[m]> doesn't look like GrapheneOS to me
02:56:04 <strcat[m]> maybe you think you're using GrapheneOS but that doesn't seem to be GrapheneOS
02:56:36 <Lighwake[m]> <strcat[m] "so either it's not GrapheneOS, o"> If I recall correctly, it happened to me 3 days ago. A few days after I flashed gOS.
02:56:52 <strcat[m]> lighwake: what happened?
02:57:07 <Lighwake[m]> Exactly like in the video
02:57:11 <strcat[m]> which is what?
02:57:24 * hasnoname[m] uploaded an image: image.png (58KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GjnYoxwrxMeHhkohnEhAjVzo/image.png >
02:57:52 <Lighwake[m]> Request for a PIN, I was able to bypass it by skipping. Than the normal PIN was requested.
02:57:57 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: except from that lock screen that's not what GrapheneOS looks like since a while
02:58:02 <hasnoname[m]> On gos and latest version
02:58:10 <strcat[m]> lighwake: that doesn't make any sense
02:58:15 <strcat[m]> lighwake: there is nothing being skipped
02:58:30 <take_a_deep_brea> lighwake:  using another keyboard ?
02:58:46 <Lighwake[m]> Different UI
02:58:54 <Lighwake[m]> Not regular PIN UI
02:59:00 <strcat[m]> a different UI is not anything being skipped
02:59:03 <strcat[m]> I don't know why that's being claimed
02:59:22 <rny> hasnoname[m]: can you re-ask your question properly.
02:59:28 <rny> and withdraw your claim that anything has been skipped.
02:59:44 <Lighwake[m]> But you can bypass it by swiping back.  I guess it can be called "skipping"
02:59:52 <strcat[m]> you aren't bypassing or skipping anything
02:59:53 <take_a_deep_brea> lighwake: bypass would mean you didnt have to submit a pin/password ? dont understand .
02:59:56 <rny> Lighwake[m]: it is not skipping, it is going back.
03:00:19 <rny> Lighwake[m]: please get the vocabulary correct.
03:00:33 <take_a_deep_brea>  * lighwake: bypass would mean you didnt have to submit a pin/password  .dont understand .
03:00:44 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "a different UI is not anything b"> I usually get asked twice to enter the password after a reboot. Few days ago I tried to enter the password even before the black ui screen came up and was able to login. Today I tried to press back when that black ui came up and it took me to normal login screen.
03:01:09 <Lighwake[m]> It happened right after a boot. So going "back" doesn't make sense.
03:01:13 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: no, you don't get asked the password twice
03:01:20 <strcat[m]> you seem quite confused about how the OS works
03:01:38 <hasnoname[m]> <rny "lighwake: it is not skipping, it"> Is that black screen ui that asking for password is optional?
03:01:43 <strcat[m]> you're using multiple profiles seemingly without realizing it
03:01:54 <strcat[m]> either that or this is concern trolling
03:02:15 <rny> i use multiple profiles, the other profiles dont prompt until they are switched to
03:02:27 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
03:02:42 <rny> hasnoname[m]: afaik, the keyguard UI prompt is user-initiated, on boot, it doesnt just appear.
03:02:55 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "you're using multiple profiles s"> Do not have other profile not even guest
03:02:59 <Lighwake[m]> I haven't had that problem after I switched off multiple users. That's not my concert.
03:02:59 <take_a_deep_brea> @strcat:matrix.org:  i think they are just puzzled and didnt word their concern properly
03:03:08 <somenerd[m]> odd claims though...
03:03:21 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "either that or this is concern t"> I honestly not. I have had this doubt for a while
03:03:26 <rny> regardless, i dont think its graphene os either
03:03:35 <rny> the keyguard UI just doesnt pop up like that without user-initiation./
03:03:59 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS has a blue accent color, the OS in the video did not
03:04:01 <rny> unless it was some old version that uses full disk encryption
03:04:16 <Lighwake[m]> I'm just trying to explain what happened. Obviously there were at least two people on Graphene who had the same experience recently.
03:04:27 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound like it
03:04:32 <strcat[m]> and it looks more like concern trolling to me
03:04:39 <strcat[m]> video posted is not GrapheneOS
03:04:47 <strcat[m]> and nothing was bypassed or skipped
03:05:05 <rny> anyways, since its concluded that its likely not grapheneos. its now offtopic
03:05:17 <rny> please move the discussion to #grapheneos-offtopic
03:05:35 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS simply doesn't look like that
03:05:35 <somenerd[m]> > I'm just trying to explain what happened. Obviously there were at least two people on Graphene who had the same experience recently.
03:05:35 <somenerd[m]> what?
03:05:40 <take_a_deep_brea> lighwake: not really sure how you could conclude two people
03:06:11 <somenerd[m]> I mean, a sample size of 2 isn't much
03:06:15 <somenerd[m]> 3-4, maybe
03:06:27 <Lighwake[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "lighwake: not really sure how yo"> The messages are already deleted. I just said I had the same experience with the user that introduced this.
03:07:01 <somenerd[m]> yeah I saw it, but still, two people isn't much
03:07:13 <somenerd[m]> also file a bug on the os issue tracker
03:07:14 <somenerd[m]> why here?
03:07:16 <rny> nothing gets deleted here. they are logged.
03:07:22 <somenerd[m]> who's gonna listen or care here?

03:08:17 <somenerd[m]> not here
03:08:22 <take_a_deep_brea> somenerd:  they think its an OS issue . lighwake  please get your wording right bypassing authentication is not a trivial matter . also the UI does cause doubt and what strcat said about accent color
03:08:43 <somenerd[m]> also if it was, why would most people send it here?
03:08:54 <strcat[m]> lighwake: you made a false claim that appears to me to be concern trolling
03:09:05 <strcat[m]> lighwake: and you're just convincing me with the further messages
03:09:15 <somenerd[m]> look, if anyone wants to make a claim or something, this is the wrong place

03:10:20 <strcat[m]> and what was claimed by both of you is not shown in any way by the video
03:10:27 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "lighwake: that video is not of G"> I'm upto date. I can send you another video or can do a video chat. I'm not trolling
03:10:48 <somenerd[m]> then go onto GitHub or something
03:10:49 <strcat[m]> super odd to have 2 accounts claiming something that's clearly not the case
03:10:53 <Lighwake[m]> Sorry to bother anyone. I merely   said it happened to me to, but it seems its "concern trolling"
03:11:02 <somenerd[m]> then go onto GitHub
03:11:13 <somenerd[m]> no one's stopping you from filing an issue
03:11:21 <somenerd[m]> instead of taking up people's time
03:11:23 <strcat[m]> GitHub issue tracker is not a place to ask questions / get support, there's no indication of any bug in GrapheneOS
03:11:29 <strcat[m]> the issue tracker takes my time too
03:11:32 <somenerd[m]> I meant the bug apparently
03:11:39 <strcat[m]> no indication of any bug
03:11:44 <somenerd[m]> yeah
03:11:49 <strcat[m]> the video shows trying to enter a PIN, going back, and then trying to enter PIN again
03:11:57 <strcat[m]> I have no idea why anyone is claiming to have bypassed a PIN
03:12:07 <somenerd[m]> and if there was, they wouldn't waste time here
03:13:12 <strcat[m]> when you boot the device, it's locked
03:13:21 <strcat[m]> you enter the lock method of the owner profile and it's unlocked
03:13:22 <strcat[m]> that's it
03:13:27 <strcat[m]> there are not multiple PINs
03:13:34 <take_a_deep_brea> hasnoname: lighwake:  if you make a claim or support one its upto you to substantiate it . all we saw is one clippomg with doubtful UI . if you feel its not concern trolling like has happened in this room so many time before please substantiate the claim further .

03:13:53 <strcat[m]> a profile has 1 primary lock method
03:13:58 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "I have no idea why anyone is cla"> Not saying it's bypassed. I usually need to enter the pin twice to get in. That black ui then the regular ui
03:14:00 <strcat[m]> and unless you have a SIM PIN that's the only thing to enter
03:14:24 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: there is 1 primary lock method for a profile not 2
03:14:30 <strcat[m]> you don't enter the lock method 2x
03:14:54 <strcat[m]> if you want I can list out what's wrong with that image which makes me say that it is not GrapheneOS
03:15:01 <strcat[m]>  * if you want I can list out what's wrong with that video which makes me say that it is not GrapheneOS
03:15:37 <take_a_deep_brea> seriously SIM PIN UI is a lot different
03:15:52 <Lighwake[m]> I will try to recreate what happened later. If it happens again I will take it to the issue tracker with a more detailed explanation and proof. If not, than even better.
03:16:15 <Lighwake[m]> No one had to worry about anything.
03:16:22 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "you don't enter the lock method "> That's the confusion. After I restart, I see the normal login screen then after few seconds it takes me to that black ui. I enter the pin and then it goes back to the normal login screen where I enter pin again. Don't have sim lock
03:16:23 <take_a_deep_brea> i rebooted just to check that
03:16:24 <Lighwake[m]> * No one has to worry about anything.
03:16:55 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: that's not normal and your video is not GrapheneOS
03:17:03 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: you have something else
03:17:12 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have that green accent color anymore
03:17:22 <take_a_deep_brea> hasnoname: i have rebooted countless times . i have never seen anything like this . and i am on the beta release
03:17:25 <strcat[m]> you think you're using GrapheneOS but I don't think you are
03:17:34 <strcat[m]> maybe you should be concerned about that
03:17:46 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't look like that
03:18:05 <strcat[m]> I mean, totally possible you've got some weird device management stuff that makes it look like that

03:20:59 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: and you *should* be concerned both about that and about the deviations from the standard GrapheneOS UI

03:22:19 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: I think it's doing something very strange
03:22:30 <strcat[m]> and I recommend that people avoid device managers and accessibility services
03:22:40 <strcat[m]> disable both and see what happens
03:22:52 <strcat[m]> password managers should use autofill service / keyboard
03:22:54 <strcat[m]> not accessibility service
03:23:12 <strcat[m]> and accessibility service is really inappropriate for anything but a must have accessibility feature where it can't be provided any other way

03:28:05 <strcat[m]> that's really weird
03:28:31 <strcat[m]> a device admin can certainly do weird stuff like that but it depends on what privileges they request and you can see a list
03:29:17 <strcat[m]> that's really not a normal UI
03:29:18 <hasnoname[m]> Sorry for the confusion. I wasn't sure if it was normal and thought that ui was a part of security after login

03:31:20 <strcat[m]> that's not a keyboard

03:32:32 <Lighwake[m]> I agree that It was not GraphineOS UI
03:32:38 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: what was happening there is actually pretty concerning
03:32:39 <mr_hebi_san[m]> That's probably for the best
03:32:54 <Lighwake[m]> Then what was it?
03:32:57 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: it looks like it's using device management features to partially roll back to some older screen lock UI in a broken way
03:33:07 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: whatever it's doing is really broken
03:33:13 <strcat[m]> and I don't know why Island would mess with the lock screen
03:33:19 <strcat[m]> those are pretty concerning privileges
03:33:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Yes that UI can be found in the phone.
03:34:01 <strcat[m]> yes but not there
03:34:03 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Go to biometrics and try to set a fingerprint
03:34:11 <strcat[m]> I know it's a standard UI

03:38:37 <strcat[m]> use a VPN app
03:38:44 <strcat[m]> if you really want you can send only 1 app's traffic through it
03:38:49 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "hasnoname: it's not"> Figured that

03:40:50 <strcat[m]> whatever it was doing is messed up
03:41:02 <strcat[m]> I don't know if they intend to do that but I find it pretty weird they request those lockscreen permissions
03:41:09 <strcat[m]> what valid reason would they have to be messing with the lockscreen UI?
03:41:29 <strcat[m]> and why would they need to be able to wipe the device, etc?
03:41:38 <strcat[m]> seems like some serious feature creep beyond managing a work profile
03:41:54 <strcat[m]> and there's a reason we recommend using user profiles and not trusting a third party app to manage a work profile
03:42:02 <strcat[m]> the app is in charge of the work profile
03:42:10 <strcat[m]> they can disable it being isolated from the main profile if they want
03:42:21 <strcat[m]> the device manager app owns the work profile
03:42:23 <strcat[m]> not you
03:44:13 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "and there's a reason we recommen"> I know. I had to put apps like Google maps and Spotify in work profile. I needed those apps to work along with main profile
03:44:42 <hasnoname[m]> With multiple profiles, I can only share phone calls but not calls like from signal
03:45:08 <somenerd[m]> well, signal doesn't have a way to tell that it's the same phone
03:48:49 <hasnoname[m]> Well the main problem with maintaining multiple profiles is that I can't simultaneously use them both. Like talking on signal on one profile and using maps on another profile.
03:48:49 <hasnoname[m]> It's nothing to do with graphene os.
03:49:34 <honbunpun[m]> I'm trying to install f droid on a new profile, but it won't install, what's wrong?
03:50:04 <Lighwake[m]> You're installing an old version
03:50:22 <Lighwake[m]> It must match the one you have on your owner
03:50:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <honbunpun[m] "I'm trying to install f droid on"> You can't use the version on the main site.  You have to specifically go to the page in fdroid with the latest version
03:50:51 <honbunpun[m]> I downloaded the apk from f droid though
03:51:17 <somenerd[m]> it's within the site
03:51:21 <somenerd[m]> (apparently)
03:52:04 <mr_hebi_san[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
03:52:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Yeah you have to specifically download the latest version, which they tuck away in that page.
03:53:14 <Lighwake[m]> They don't make it easy :)
03:53:38 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Graphene will not allow you to install an downgraded app on a different profile when you have installed a higher version else where.
03:54:23 <honbunpun[m]> I see.. I will try this link then, thanks
03:55:29 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I've been wondering about this actually. Is the package installer privileged in ways that other parts of Android are not?  If the user profiles are strictly sandboxed then is there one and only one package installer that all of them must use?
03:56:43 <strcat[m]> > Graphene will not allow you to install an downgraded app on a different profile when you have installed a higher version else where.
03:56:51 <strcat[m]> it's how Android works
03:56:53 <strcat[m]> AOSP is the same way
03:57:23 <strcat[m]> the package manager verifies the signature of every package before installing it and prevents changing the key without a key rotation authorized with the old key
03:57:28 <strcat[m]> and prevents downgrading the versionCode
03:57:54 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: the base system stuff like the package manager isn't simply an unprivileged app
03:58:03 <strcat[m]> it's not an app running within a profile
03:59:04 <take_a_deep_brea> @strcat:matrix.org:  isnt there a way to expose the work profile feature through the settings app ? is it necessar to have a third party app to do this ?
03:59:24 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: the whole point of work profile feature is that it's a work profile owned by your company's device management app
03:59:28 <strcat[m]> that's the purpose of the feature
03:59:33 <strcat[m]> it's not meant for how people are using it this way
03:59:44 <somenerd[m]> User profiles are meant for that
03:59:46 <take_a_deep_brea> i understanf
03:59:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> That's interesting stuff.  This also seems related to the play store and its requirements for versioning
03:59:50 <take_a_deep_brea> *d
03:59:52 <strcat[m]> it's for BYOD where the user owns the device and the device manager owns this work profile
03:59:53 <somenerd[m]> (since they are managed by the OS)
04:00:12 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to be used as a way for the end user to isolate apps
04:00:21 <strcat[m]>  * it's not meant to be used as a way for the end user to have an isolated workspace
04:00:31 <strcat[m]> simply not how it's designed
04:00:46 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to make a form of nested profile which was meant to be used that way but that is really not what work profiles are
04:01:24 <take_a_deep_brea> also it makes sense to trust a companys device manager app as you trust them to pay you and other stuff
04:01:46 <take_a_deep_brea> no brainer to trust a third party app with device manager priviliges
04:02:33 <somenerd[m]> I mean, probably shouldn't lol
04:02:39 <somenerd[m]> but it's advertised like that
04:02:56 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: well also it doesn't need to ask for those other privileges
04:03:05 <strcat[m]> it could just take control of the work profile
04:03:08 <strcat[m]> and not ask for anything invasive
04:03:13 <strcat[m]> like fucking with your lockscreen
04:03:19 <strcat[m]> I dunno why it even wants to do that
04:03:36 <strcat[m]> it does give you a list of what privileges it's going to grant to the device manager
04:03:55 <strcat[m]> so for example if it was a remote wipe tool it'd ask for wiping privilege but presumably nothing else
04:04:14 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "it would be possible to make a f"> It'd be great if there's that functionality
04:04:32 <somenerd[m]> well, it's unneeded
04:04:37 <strcat[m]> anyway I've never seen that UI and I still don't know why hasnoname's accent color is green
04:04:44 <somenerd[m]> user profiles are already there
04:06:26 <take_a_deep_brea> hasnoname:  i understood . the point is that is not the right way to improve app isolation . if apps need to be isolated that should not build on work profile feature .
04:07:05 <strcat[m]> there is underlying infrastructure that makes sense to reuse
04:07:13 <strcat[m]> but the work profile feature itself is just not suited to it
04:07:29 <strcat[m]> it can be used to make an isolated workspace but having an app owning that rather than the user controlling it via the OS is just odd
04:07:35 <take_a_deep_brea> also suggest next time you have an issue make sure an app with absurd priviliges is not present
04:07:37 <strcat[m]> and then you depend on this app to set it up properly
04:07:41 <strcat[m]> since it can be used in different way
04:07:53 <strcat[m]> and yeah this app asking for ability to mess up the lockscreen
04:07:56 <strcat[m]> is really weird
04:08:03 <take_a_deep_brea>  * hasnoname: also suggest next time you have an issue make sure an app with absurd priviliges is not present
04:08:11 <strcat[m]> I don't know why they are even displaying that prompt
04:08:33 <strcat[m]> they are asking the OS to authorize the user... before unlocking?
04:08:41 <strcat[m]> why not just leave it alone and let them unlock?
04:08:42 <strcat[m]> don't get it
04:08:45 <somenerd[m]> I mean, it having control over the profile is still a bit extreme
04:09:32 <mr_hebi_san[m]> There is one difference: I can screenshot the normal unlock pin
04:09:53 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I cannot screenshot that crazy pin screen
04:09:56 <somenerd[m]> lol
04:10:09 <somenerd[m]> idk why though
04:10:24 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Seriously the screenshots eben reveal the afterglow from the button presses
04:10:30 <somenerd[m]> probably won't leak your password...
04:10:31 <somenerd[m]> what
04:10:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Try it :)
04:11:14 <somenerd[m]> not going to
04:12:46 <Lighwake[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "Try it :)"> Is it when setting up biometrics?
04:12:53 <honbunpun[m]> Did they take standard notes off fdroid? Can't find it
04:13:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> No, that biometric one cannot be screenshot
04:13:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> The standard lock screen with the fancy touch animations can be
04:14:32 <honbunpun[m]> Is there a way to transfer some apps from owner profile to new profile or do you have to redownload them again?
04:15:05 <Lighwake[m]> <honbunpun[m] "Is there a way to transfer some "> Not through the phone. They are entirely separate.
04:15:43 <honbunpun[m]> <Lighwake[m] "Not through the phone. They are "> Okay thanks
04:16:11 <Lighwake[m]> * Not through the phone. Their storage is separate.
04:17:12 <mr_hebi_san[m]> God I wonder if you can screenshot the gesture unlock 😨
04:18:03 <take_a_deep_brea> honbunpun: the whole point of user profiles is isolating data . wont it be self defeating if the OS provided a straightforward way to transfer data between them ?
04:19:13 <bethefriction[m]> I'm trying to do that with a USB but my other profiles can't read it, can't figure out why
04:20:30 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: really thought you just weren't using GrapheneOS because never seen any app using device management perms to do something so weird
04:20:47 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: don't understand why your accent color is green tho
04:23:44 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat[m] "hasnoname: don't understand why "> Where do you see it green? I see blue.
04:25:16 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: in the original video you uploaded

06:14:06 <strcat[m]> louipc: it would be interesting but gl with that

06:16:01 <strcat[m]> it's 185k to have your tld evaluated

06:16:09 <strcat[m]> and other costs
06:16:09 <somenerd[m]> how about something like graphene.os or something
06:16:15 <strcat[m]> and you have to pay for all the infrastructure etc.
06:16:19 <somenerd[m]> instead of a whole tld lol
06:16:30 <strcat[m]> somenerd: yeah that's like 200k + 50k/year since the tld doesn't exist
06:16:47 <strcat[m]> plus paying people to maintain infra
06:16:49 <strcat[m]> and paying for infra
06:16:56 <strcat[m]> paying for required partnerships
06:17:05 <strcat[m]> a lot of these tld companies are going to go bankrupt
06:17:07 <strcat[m]> it's a bubble
06:17:16 <somenerd[m]> well, safe to say that no one's gonna use that for masquerading as GrapheneOS
06:17:18 <strcat[m]> there are a bunch of new companies based around gtlds
06:17:26 <strcat[m]> they're screwed imo

07:06:30 <somenerd[m]> quite rare though, as they do listen to responses and read docs
07:15:17 <pnrxa[m]1> There are a couple that struggle trying to follow 3rd party documentation and need to be pointed in the right direction
07:15:45 <somenerd[m]> yeah
07:17:37 <strcat[m]> the 3rd party docs are mostly wrong
07:17:41 <strcat[m]> so that's the issue
07:17:53 <somenerd[m]> yeah and third party installation guides
07:19:38 <somenerd[m]> (which are quite wrong)
07:52:12 <hard_taffy[m]> Does anyone else have a rare issue where the Clock app (version 11) resets and you lose all alarms, clocks, timers, and settings? I've had it happen today and in the past, but I don't know how to reproduce the issue. I'm using GrapheneOS 2021.02.07.17.
07:55:32 <take_a_deep_brea> to my knowledge thats the first time someone has brought this issue up
08:47:01 <rhythm>  hi everyone
08:47:26 <rhythm> Im unable to flash latest image through command process on my sargo anymore. Dont know why. It showing an error on terminal then crashes. Also i cant use web installer because i don't have wifi connection. Then what to do any solution please help
08:49:11 <strcat> are you trying to install GrapheneOS?
08:49:17 <strcat> not clear what you're trying to do
08:49:27 <strcat> rhythm: do you already have it installed?
08:49:28 <mynacol[m]> rhythm what is the error message? From what OS are you installing?
08:49:55 <rhythm> Now im stock
08:50:01 <rhythm> Windows 10
08:50:33 <strcat> why can't you use the web installer exactly?
08:50:38 <strcat> you don't have internet access?
08:50:39 <rhythm> I installed graphene January perfectly. But now i cant
08:50:54 <rhythm> I don't have wifi
08:51:21 <mynacol[m]> rhythm: Are you following https://grapheneos.org/install/cli ? What is the error message? On what step?
08:51:46 <rhythm> Does anything changes in normal installation process?
08:52:33 <mynacol[m]> Just follow the official guide. We cannot provide support for third-party guides or videos
08:52:47 <rhythm> Yes...
08:53:45 <rhythm> When im going to click flash all then terminal open 2 to 3 sec then chashes
08:53:58 <rhythm> Crashes
08:54:08 <mynacol[m]> You are not following the official guide
08:54:54 <mynacol[m]> The easiest way would be to give your PC temporary internet access
08:56:24 <rhythm> Anything changes in flashing process for command based flashing? Im not talking web installation process
08:56:29 <mynacol[m]> Is this possible?
08:56:49 <strcat[m]> rhythm: there's no point where you're supposed to click flash-all
08:57:00 <strcat[m]> rhythm: there never has been
08:57:02 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
08:57:04 <rhythm> Because i previously installed graphene on sargo. And long term user
08:57:26 <rhythm> What
08:57:26 <strcat[m]> use exactly the commands there with `sunfish` replaced with `sargo`
08:57:48 <rhythm> I always did
08:58:00 <strcat[m]> the official guide has never involved clicking on flash-all
08:58:02 <rhythm> Okok
08:58:28 <strcat[m]> it's really important to do the CLI approach exactly as documented there
08:58:43 <strcat[m]> we recommend the web installer for most people because CLI requires carefully following those instructions exactly as written
08:59:39 <somenerd[m]> also needs a lot of packages
08:59:59 <rhythm> Actually i already downloaded latest image. I don't have wifi connection. Sadly
09:01:56 <mynacol[m]> rhythm: Do you have `platform-tools` downloaded?
09:02:02 <rhythm> Yes
09:02:13 <rhythm> Also image
09:02:19 <rhythm> Then unzipped
09:02:47 <rhythm> Moved all files into platform tools folder
09:02:57 <rhythm> Then i use flash all
09:03:01 <mynacol[m]> Great
09:03:06 <mynacol[m]> <rhythm "Then i use flash all"> No
09:03:12 <rhythm> Y
09:03:25 <rhythm> I always use this bt it worked
09:03:44 <rhythm> But from February its nt working anymore
09:04:00 <mynacol[m]> Right-click in the platform tools folder and select "open power shell here" (or sth like that)
09:04:08 <rhythm> Ol
09:04:11 <rhythm> Ok
09:04:14 <rhythm> Then
09:04:43 <mynacol[m]> First of all: follow what I say, don't deviate, don't add extra steps
09:04:51 <mynacol[m]> Promise
09:04:52 <rhythm> Ok
09:05:19 <rhythm> Im following just say what to do step by step...im noob
09:05:27 <rhythm> But i love graphene
09:06:39 <mynacol[m]> So you are in Powershell (blue background) and the path is sth like C:...\platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows\
09:06:52 <rhythm> Ok then
09:07:45 <mynacol[m]> Are you? (forgot the question mark)
09:09:04 <rhythm> Just tell me
09:09:21 <mynacol[m]> Are you in Powershell?
09:09:27 <rhythm> Yes
09:09:27 <mynacol[m]> (blue background)
09:09:31 <mynacol[m]> OK
09:09:32 <rhythm> Yes
09:09:45 <mynacol[m]> Tyoe "dir" and press enter
09:09:51 <rhythm> Ok
09:09:56 <rhythm> Then
09:10:01 <mynacol[m]> You should get a list of files
09:10:06 <rhythm> Ok
09:11:22 <mynacol[m]> You have to see fastboot.exe, flash-all.bat, image-sargo-2020.12.12.03.zip and more
09:11:42 <mynacol[m]> (Oh the date in the sargo zip is wrong)
09:12:24 <rhythm> Yes..
09:12:27 <rhythm> Wait
09:12:29 <mynacol[m]> OK
09:12:54 <rhythm> No option to open powershell
09:12:59 <mynacol[m]> Now enter: $env:Path = "$pwd;$env:Path"
09:13:19 <mynacol[m]> <rhythm "No option to open powershell"> Wait a sec
09:13:26 <mynacol[m]> have to start my windows 10 vm
09:14:27 <rhythm> Ok
09:14:50 <mynacol[m]> <rhythm "No option to open powershell"> You can try holding shift while right-clicking in the explorer window
09:15:12 <rhythm> Oh i forgot the process
09:15:30 <rhythm> Wait i rebooted my pc
09:15:58 <mynacol[m]> No problem
09:16:11 <rhythm> Thnks for helping me
09:16:28 <rhythm> Ihv trying fr 1 week
09:16:29 <mynacol[m]> Open the folder where you unzipped platform tools and the sargo factory image
09:16:36 <mynacol[m]> (again)
09:17:01 <mynacol[m]> then hold shift while right-clicking in the explorer window
09:17:03 <rhythm> Yes
09:17:16 <mynacol[m]> and select "open powershell window here"
09:17:54 <rhythm> Done
09:18:08 <mynacol[m]> Now you have a window with blue background?
09:18:16 <rhythm> Yes sir
09:18:29 <mynacol[m]> Type "dir" now and press enter
09:18:45 <rhythm> Yes done
09:18:45 <mynacol[m]> what do you see?
09:18:53 <rhythm> Showing many file
09:19:26 <mynacol[m]> Do you see fastboot.exe, flash-all.bat, image-sargo-2021.02.07.17.zip and more
09:19:29 <rhythm> Mode / lastwritetime/ length / name
09:19:43 <rhythm> Wait
09:19:59 <rhythm> Yes
09:20:09 <mynacol[m]> All 3?
09:20:13 <rhythm> Yes
09:20:19 <mynacol[m]> OK
09:20:42 <mynacol[m]> Now type: $env:Path = "$pwd;$env:Path"
09:20:53 <mynacol[m]> (everything agter the first colon)
09:21:31 <mynacol[m]> (I mean the ":")
09:21:33 <rhythm> Wait if i goto fastboot mode tgen i cant talk to u...coz i dont have wifi...so please mind it
09:21:46 <rhythm> Im following wait
09:21:59 <mynacol[m]> Do you have any other device with internet?
09:22:10 <rhythm> No
09:22:15 <rhythm> Sir
09:22:21 <mynacol[m]> OK
09:22:29 <rhythm> Yh
09:22:49 <mynacol[m]> let's try testing fastboot
09:22:58 <mynacol[m]> Type: fastboot --version
09:23:05 <mynacol[m]> what do you get?
09:23:22 <rhythm> Wait
09:24:34 <rhythm> That command nt working
09:24:47 <rhythm> That path command
09:25:02 <mynacol[m]> What was the output?
09:26:20 <rhythm> Nothing
09:26:49 <strcat[m]> there's not supposed to be output
09:27:36 <rhythm> $env:Path = "$pwd;$env:Path"
09:27:46 <rhythm> Is it correct
09:28:38 <mynacol[m]> yes
09:28:39 <mynacol[m]> Nontheless, I have to warn you. During install problems can arise (e.g. faulty usb cable). If you dont have any other device with internet connection, we cant help you. Worst-case you are stuck in fastboot mode on your device until you find the culprit and remove it. Until then, your phone cannot be used normally. Are you aware of the above and know the risks?
09:29:10 <rhythm> Yes..i can flash stock
09:29:15 <rhythm> Then
09:29:26 <rhythm> Just tell me wht to do
09:29:55 <rhythm> $env:Path = "$pwd;$env:Path"
09:30:02 <mynacol[m]> If you have a faulty usb cable or port, the flash can fail mid-way and neither flashing to stock nor flashing to Graphene may fail.
09:30:18 <rhythm> No no i have new one
09:30:49 <rhythm> I use it daily
09:31:39 <mynacol[m]> There is still a possibility
09:32:15 <rhythm> Fastboot version is 30.0.5
09:32:41 <rhythm> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
09:32:52 <mynacol[m]> you might end up with a non-working device (which may be fixed, but we cant help you)
09:33:09 <rhythm> Its ok
09:33:19 <rhythm> Now what to do
09:33:23 <mynacol[m]> OK
09:33:50 * mynacol[m] posted a file: GrapheneOS install instructions.html (25KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/mynacol.xyz/iaecQiEkMqGgzCuYNcqLypsY/GrapheneOS install instructions.html >
09:34:18 <mynacol[m]> Here is the webpage as a file. Please transfer it to your PC first
09:34:51 <rhythm> Done sir
09:35:10 <rhythm> Yeah i already saved it
09:35:18 <rhythm> Thnks.
09:35:24 <mynacol[m]> So you have the webpage on the PC
09:35:26 <mynacol[m]> ?
09:36:13 <rhythm> I mean i saved the installation process page as a offline
09:36:28 <mynacol[m]> On the PC I assume
09:36:39 <rhythm> Yes
09:36:58 <rhythm> Now what to do next step
09:38:39 <mynacol[m]> You can now follow the install instructions from "Connecting the phone" onwards. Good Luck!
09:41:12 <rhythm> I have unlocked bootloader. Now
09:45:28 <mynacol[m]> rhythm: The commands you have to enter are "fastboot flashing unlock", "./flash-all.bat" and "./flash-all.bat". But also read the instructions around it
09:45:57 <mynacol[m]> rhythm: The commands you have to enter are "fastboot flashing unlock", "./flash-all.bat" and "fastboot flashing lock". But also read the instructions around it
09:46:15 <rhythm> Okok
09:46:20 <rhythm> Got it
09:48:58 <happy-1[m]> <NewPerson "Hello - I'd be grateful for some"> Happen to me I click left then right on web page and it then worked after that so refreshed the page

11:56:12 <strcat> testing bridge
11:57:31 <Albakham[m]> Really strange, I cannot send nor receive calls
11:58:56 <Albakham[m]> When I call someone, the screen gets black and nothing happens
11:59:18 <Albakham[m]> When someone calls me, they get instantly my voicemail
12:00:05 <strcat> your screen going black sounds like the proximity sensor is blocked
12:00:07 <somenerd[m]> well, the bridge works
12:00:10 <strcat> by a faulty screen protector perhaps
12:00:14 <strcat> somenerd[m]: works here, not in offtopic
12:00:23 <somenerd[m]> huh
12:00:32 <somenerd[m]> amazing and consistent quality
12:00:36 <strcat> somenerd[m]: just send you a message on offtopic
12:00:36 <Albakham[m]> <strcat "your screen going black sounds l"> Oups
12:00:49 <strcat> Albakham[m]: calls not working sounds like a separate issue from that
12:01:07 <strcat> some screen protectors are faulty and block the proximity sensor
12:01:10 <strcat> *shrug*
12:01:13 <Albakham[m]> I may have disabled the permission
12:01:40 <somenerd[m]> <strcat "somenerd: just send you a messag"> nope did not see anything lol
12:01:43 <somenerd[m]> curious as to what the message was lol
12:02:03 <Albakham[m]> Mmh, no that's not it
12:02:51 <Albakham[m]> When I make a call, it says call terminated ("appel terminé" in french)
12:04:16 <strcat[m]> Albakham: go into permission manager and make sure you didn't disable Phone, etc. for relevant system apps?
12:04:21 <strcat[m]> Albakham: make sure Phone app has Sensors perm?
12:05:02 * Albakham[m] uploaded a video: screen-20210211-160407.mp4 (7821KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/tedomum.net/vHaoXimPIYTwdUzfYcbcobiA/screen-20210211-160407.mp4 >
12:06:01 <strcat[m]> Albakham: check those permissions
12:06:08 <strcat[m]> for system apps in general
12:13:05 <Albakham[m]> I didn't change those...
12:13:05 <Albakham[m]> I don't have phone calls notifications either, it's like I'm on offline mode
12:13:52 <strcat[m]> Albakham: did you turn on LTE only mode?
12:14:00 <strcat[m]> Albakham: perhaps without having working VoLTE on your carrier?
12:14:13 <Albakham[m]> <strcat[m] "Albakham: did you turn on LTE on"> So I just found out, yes that's it
12:15:18 <strcat[m]> Albakham: which carrier is it
12:16:22 <Albakham[m]> Zeop, on the Réunion island, you probably don't know it ;)
12:16:52 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
12:17:28 <strcat[m]> Albakham: but yeah I guess they don't have VoLTE
12:17:28 <strcat[m]> at least not that works for us
12:17:59 <Albakham[m]> Yep
13:51:10 <bethefriction[m]> <strcat[m] "so you should be able to use adb"> I've installed adb on my windows computer and can see my device in the command prompt window with the owner profile active. However, when I switch users it says the profile is not authorized to be in USB debugging mode.
16:43:32 <savetheplanete8[> When graphene os is coming to Pixel 4a 5G?
16:48:49 <TheJollyRoger> Hello savetheplanete8[ , at this moment I can't give you an ETA. Preparations are being made in the source tree, but we don't have any accurate estimates on when.
16:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> I know this "it'll be ready when it's finished" answer sucks to hear, but I want to be realistic about this and not write a cheque that the dev team can't cash.
16:52:19 <savetheplanete8[> Okay I understand till that I'll stay with CalyxOS.
16:52:54 <savetheplanete8[> Thanks for the update 🤞
18:37:52 <m2tu[m]> JollyRoger ur name says u lovet o smoke weed
18:37:53 <m2tu[m]> is taht true or not
18:41:44 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: It's not. So far I have randomly encountered about five people named some variant of "Jolly Roger" on Freenode IRC, and many different people over the internet have used the name.
18:41:47 <TheJollyRoger> It's a very common name.
18:41:55 <TheJollyRoger> So you're likely confusing me with someone else.
18:43:05 <m2tu[m]> probally, or i seen a coffe shop in amsterdam with same name :)))
18:43:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hahahaha well, unless someone were to bequeath me one, I'm not running a coffee shop in Amsterdam :P
18:50:03 <SwankyBarbecue4[> Hey guys! How long should I expect to wait for the Pixel 4a 5G/ Pixel 5 to be supported? Sounds like the latest release works with these devices? Has that been confirmed?
18:51:11 <Publius> It does not
18:51:22 <Publius> And there isn't an ETA on support.
18:51:35 <Publius> If you're in a hurry, you should get a Pixel 4
18:53:31 * entry1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210211-135218.png (123KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qyzyFAOJtiUbSyIkIArhWsbA/Screenshot_20210211-135218.png >
18:53:35 <entry1[m]> Pixel 4a gets nearly an extra year in support. Much better than the 4 tbh
18:54:00 <entry1[m]> * Pixel 4a gets nearly an extra year in updates. Much better than the 4 tbh
18:54:38 <Publius> To be fair, by "pixel 4", I really meant the 4, the 4xl or the 4a
18:54:42 <Publius> But you make a great point
18:55:07 <entry1[m]> For sure! Just wanted to point that out
18:59:27 <take_a_deep_brea> pixel 4 is a good device. pixel 5 however is a really bad deal imo .
19:01:24 <entry1[m]> Pre-owned 3a costs $120 and the Pixel 4 is $240 (5 months longer updates for double the price). I would definitely recommend people use the 3a then upgrade to the 4a for $300
19:01:42 <entry1[m]> But Pixel 4s are a nice phone nonetheless
19:02:01 <entry1[m]> * But Pixel 4's are a nice phone nonetheless
19:02:43 <Publius> Aren't you comparing pre-owned 3a to a new 4a though
19:02:54 <Publius> That's not a fair comparison...
19:03:15 <mrbrownbadger[m]> i wish there was a big screen pixel with a huge battery.
19:03:35 <entry1[m]> Used 4a is $280-$300, new is $350 but price will decrease in coming months
19:03:37 <SwankyBarbecue4[> entry1: wouldn't be 15, not 5 months between the 3a & 4a?
19:03:49 <mrbrownbadger[m]> got the 4a5g and the screen looks tiny
19:04:03 <entry1[m]> <SwankyBarbecue4[ "entry1: wouldn't be 15, not 5 mo"> 5 months between 3a and 4
19:04:16 <Publius> entry1: Gotcha. I think it'd be really dumb to "save" $50 buying a used 4a instead of a new one...
19:04:20 <SwankyBarbecue4[> oh, my bad!
19:04:38 <entry1[m]> <Publius "entry1: Gotcha. I think it'd be "> Agreed, they have held their value quite well
19:04:48 <mtcw[m]> thinking of buying the 4a5g and waiting for grapheneos release for it
19:05:01 <mtcw[m]> the sale on right now is tempting
19:05:08 <Publius> If $50 means that much to you, you should prolly buy the used 3a for $120!
19:18:43 <m2tu[m]> anyone can help me with this :
19:18:44 * m2tu[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rAYmhuOLfcOUIZbKDGXLhRvz/message.txt >
19:19:08 <m2tu[m]> if i set this to 5242 isntead = 10 times less
19:19:27 <m2tu[m]> will this effect the apps usage. in any negative way?
19:26:01 <Grappy777> Installing graphene for the first time but installation (web) seems stuck on 'restarting device'
19:26:50 <Grappy777> It's been about 15 min since last visible progress
19:29:58 <Grappy777> Last screen on phone was some kind of menu, it said "bootd" or something like that, but now it has been black for a while. Should i interact somehow to make it progress?
19:32:45 <Grappy777> Instructions says i shouldn't interact until device is back to bootloader menu but it jasn't return to the original bootloader menu. Does graphene have a different looking bootloader menu?
19:33:25 <Grappy777> hasn't returned to*
19:36:20 <Grappy777> Touched the device and the fastbootd menu is still there. It look like i can manually reboot to bootloader. Should i do it?
19:36:27 <nscnt[m]> Grappy777: You are probably right if you think something is wrong. However, it's hard to say at a glance what it is and how you could solve it.
19:37:10 <nscnt[m]> Grappy777: You shouldn't have to manually reboot into the bootloader, no.
19:37:36 <nscnt[m]> Maybe let's begin with some more information... What operating system are you on?
19:38:03 <Grappy777> I'm on debian, raspi400
19:38:28 <Grappy777> Flashing a 4a
19:39:41 <Grappy777> First time flashing an android
19:40:12 <nscnt[m]> I never heard of the Raspberry Pi 400. Taking a quick glance, I wouldn't be surprised if it's a connection issue because the whole pc is a keyboard, isn't it?
19:40:51 <Grappy777> Yeah it's like an old amiga, just a keyboard ;)
19:41:11 <take_a_deep_brea> oh , wow
19:41:30 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont think usb will be supportef
19:41:39 <take_a_deep_brea> *d
19:41:51 <take_a_deep_brea> do you have another modern smartphone ?
19:42:30 <take_a_deep_brea> * do you have another recent android device ?
19:42:37 <take_a_deep_brea> * do you have another recent android device ?
19:43:13 <Grappy777> Have an old samsung but also a macbook
19:43:51 <Grappy777> What do you mean by usb not supported?
19:44:11 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe
19:44:30 <nscnt[m]> Grappy777: The fastboot tool expects quite a flawless connection. It can't handle any corruption when transferring data, etc.
19:44:44 <take_a_deep_brea> i am not sure if the raspi usb is good enough .
19:45:15 <take_a_deep_brea> <Grappy777 "What do you mean by usb not supp"> its my fault , my wording .
19:46:03 <Grappy777> Perhaps i should just manually select 'Reboot to bootloader' and see what happens?
19:46:35 <nscnt[m]> A poor or non-existent connection between the phone and the PC (caused by bad cables, drivers, ...) is the most common problem when trying to flash.
19:47:00 <take_a_deep_brea> not a good idea . the installation does not require manual intervention untill the end
19:47:03 <Grappy777> Got it, seems likely
19:47:22 <Grappy777> So how do i proceed?
19:47:36 <take_a_deep_brea> try using the mac
19:48:11 <take_a_deep_brea> and if you have chrome on it try web installer
19:48:43 <Grappy777> will try that, thanks
19:50:12 <Grappy777> trying a second time on the r400 first, let's see how it goes
19:50:40 <take_a_deep_brea> chrome/chromium/
19:50:41 <take_a_deep_brea> also try and use the cable that came with the device .
19:50:52 <Grappy777> have been using web usb on it before and it handled it without issues
19:52:27 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
20:37:50 <Grappy777> installed via macbook without any problem, thanks for the guiding
20:43:22 <grabba[m]> Is there a way to freeze other users when using profiles?
20:45:20 <take_a_deep_brea> grabba:  on the lock screen just press end session
20:46:26 <take_a_deep_brea> else press power buton like you wanna poweroff the device then ina user profile you will see end session option there too
20:55:13 <josephsmith> hey i have a question re installation of grapheneos
21:05:19 <Thatcher[m]> josephsmith go for it
21:12:12 <Guest60060> I noticed the latest stable release is for Pixel 4a does this also include 4a 5g
21:15:18 <grabba[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "else press power buton like you "> Should I keep the admin acc blank? I notice when I swap into a user the admin connects to the internet and throttles the user connection ( replicate via VPN always on and block without, then swap to a user and compare the speed vs turning off the admin VPN so all connection is blocked and switching to a user
21:15:25 <grabba[m]> Couple times there's been memory issues running out in the user too
21:15:45 <grapheneos_user_> <Guest60060 "I noticed the latest stable rele"> No, 4a 5g has more in common with pixel 5 than 4. Pixel 4 support is irrelevant about 4a 5g
21:17:04 <Guest60060> Thank you most appreciated!
21:39:09 <Mruser42> Hello
21:39:13 <Mruser42> One Question
21:40:12 <Mruser42> is it easy to use the original "Google"-rom after I flashed my Pixel 4a with the webInstall ?
21:40:59 <Mruser42> Or should i keep something in eyes ?
21:42:38 <grabba[m]> Would this open source encrypted photo app harden grapheme? Aes256 and no network needed
21:42:39 <grabba[m]> https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/repo/dev.leonlatsch.photok
21:44:27 <TheJollyRoger> Mruser42: If you have to return to the original Google operating system, it's the same workflow to return back at https://flash.android.com
21:44:53 <nullnode[m]> <Mruser42 "is it easy to use the original ""> You can switch back and forth, but you gotta wipe your phone whenever you switch between the Google Stock ROM and the GrapheneOS ROM
21:45:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: no
21:45:40 <mynacol[m]> <grabba[m] "Would this open source encrypted"> I doubt it. Storage is already encrypted and apps are strongly sandboxed
21:45:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> You must erase the avb key
21:46:02 <Mruser42> ok thanks
21:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: the android flash tool doesn't automatically unprovision third party avb custom keys?
21:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
21:46:20 <nullnode[m]> <grabba[m] "https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/r"> who made it? has it been audited? is it updated regularly? who maintains it? who is providing you the updates?
21:49:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just get a life tbh
21:49:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's just a photo editor and there's no real advantage to double encryption
21:50:16 <nullnode[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just get a life tbh "> Don't be that mean weeb
21:50:36 * TheJollyRoger starts wondering about meet-in-the-middle attacks for people who try to double up on ciphers.
21:51:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> * It's just a photo gallery and there's no real advantage to double encryption
21:52:06 <nullnode[m]> > * <@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org> starts wondering about meet-in-the-middle attacks for people who try to double up on ciphers.
21:52:06 <nullnode[m]> that's what I'm thinking in the greater threat model
21:53:00 <nullnode[m]> Layering encryption may be dangerous at times
21:53:33 <nullnode[m]> Anyone have a math/crypto background that could provide some insight?
21:54:19 <TheJollyRoger> I couldn't tell you unfortunately, math and cryptography is beyond my level of understanding. We do know though that meet-in-the-middle attacks were known academically as far back as the late 1970's.
21:55:09 <TheJollyRoger> *the math involved in cryptography is beyond my level of understanding
21:55:52 <nullnode[m]> I always thought chaining crypto is fine, but that's in the same linear decryption routines, I try not have crypts in crypts
21:55:58 <nullnode[m]> but I've done it, never seen an issue with it
21:56:07 <Bughat33> Can anyone offer any pointers on using Fedora 33 to install. I was able to unlock the boot loader of a Pixel 4 using Fedoras stock adb but the version doesn't report the same way as Debian based systems.
21:56:09 <nullnode[m]> just gotta never use the same keys/passwords
21:56:31 <TheJollyRoger> Bughat33: Stop right there. You're about to cause a brick.
21:58:23 <TheJollyRoger> Bughat33: Please install Chromium (Fedora includes it in their OS repositories) and use the web install at https://grapheneos.org/install/web . Fedora's included version of adb is liable to flash the wrong slot and result in an unbootable OS since it most likely doesn't support autodetection and is incorrectly versioned. You don't want this to happen.
21:58:24 <grapheneos_user_> Bughat33: adb is not used in the installation process and whoever told you that is a dangerous rogue. Adb often causes bricked devices and it is dangerous for people **ahem techlore** to go around telling people to install GOS using adb.
21:59:47 <grapheneos_user_> Use either the command line instructions at grapheneos.org/install or the web installer as our resident pirate has linked.
22:00:39 <Bughat33> I have tried the web install on Chromium but it says device not found.
22:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> Bughat33: you are likely missing the udev rules/permissions.
22:01:54 <TheJollyRoger> One moment.
22:02:27 <Bughat33> Ah I did have to install specific device rules in rules.d to be able to recognize the device with adb.
22:03:15 <TheJollyRoger> Bughat33, ok then, quick sanity check: is the device on fastboot when you attempt to install?
22:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> If so, this leaves two possibilities by way of elimination:
22:03:43 <TheJollyRoger> A) your USB cable is missing a trace, if you are not using the Google branded cable.
22:05:01 <Bughat33> The device is on fastboot but the cable is Type-c which I normally connect an external Nvme drive for backups.
22:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> B) Your motherboard's USB slot is missing one or more required traces, is broken, or your BIOS/firmware doesn't implement all the necessary features that fastboot requires to talk to the device. Most motherboard vendors don't properly implement USB across all their slots or sometimes only implement the bare minimum features that they expect the majority of users to use like media transfer
22:05:16 <TheJollyRoger> protocol, human interface devices, and mass storage... but not the functions required for debugging a bootloader.
22:06:14 <TheJollyRoger> So the fact that it works for doing the most common tasks is not really a good indicator of it being good enough to install GrapheneOS.
22:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> This is true for both the cable itself, and the plug it's inserted into.
22:07:19 <Bughat33> I do have an expanscion card for usb 3.p with a type-c port. I just assumed the motherboard type-c was closer to the bone, so to speak.
22:07:55 <Bughat33> Sorry I meant 3.0 type-c
22:08:22 <TheJollyRoger> Bughat33: Try a few different ones. Try changing cables and/or ports, systematically. Usually for the majority of people, this tends to fix things because some vendors include one working port, but they often don't label which one it is.
22:09:27 <TheJollyRoger> If you've downloaded and provisioned the correct udev rules, and you've restarted or properly reloaded the rules, and you're absolutely confident of that, if it still doesn't talk to fastboot,
22:09:28 <Publius> Listen to TheJollyRoger; he knows wtf he's talking about
22:09:43 <TheJollyRoger> or it allows you to unlock the bootloader but *not* to flash the OS, it's one of these two.
22:10:57 <nscnt[m]> Bughat33: How did you install the udev rules? Fedora 33 has pretty bad packages or non at all.
22:11:26 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, thanks Publius. I have to get rolling for now, but this should get you started; note though we've had a few users in here who have had the misfortune of having laptops or motherboards that have all of their USB slots broken.
22:12:10 <Bughat33> Ok I'll tinker with that. I have to resize a btrfs filesystem to make room for a more Debian based system. I think I may have a problem with the export path.
22:12:26 <TheJollyRoger> In which case, they've had to solve the problem by trying another computer, or another, until they find both one with a slot and a cable that fully implements the full and complete USB specification which allows fastboot to talk to the phone.
22:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> But generally it boils down to these three problems. Udev, cables, and USB support on the motherboard.
22:13:50 <zvl12[m]> Generic question : If you shoud GUESS bases on past developmets, how much time will it take for the Pixel 5 to go from Experimental stage to Stable release ?
22:13:55 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I gotta run, thanks for the help guys, and nscnt[m] good to know, I'll mark that down in case anyone else on Fedora has a similar issue... not the first time the package maintainers end up being behind, certainly won't be the last.
22:14:48 <zvl12[m]>  * Generic question : If you should GUESS bases on past developments, how much time will it take for the Pixel 5 to go from Experimental stage to Stable release ?
22:15:02 <zvl12[m]>  * Generic question : If you should GUESS based on past developments, how much time will it take for the Pixel 5 to go from Experimental stage to Stable release ?
22:15:35 <TheJollyRoger> Before I go: zvl12[m] Sorry, we don't know, I'm unwilling to write a cheque the devs can't cash, and each device, as well as the support they require for full support, is unique.
22:16:02 <Bughat33> I hand bombed SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="<MyPixelDeviceMajorMinorNodes>", MODE="0666" into a file called 51-android-rules. done remember the actual digits at the moment.
22:16:06 <TheJollyRoger> So it will be done, when it is finished.
22:17:40 <TheJollyRoger> Bughat33: it's a tad bit kludgy but try the following:
22:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules && sudo mv 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules && sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
22:18:51 <TheJollyRoger> If after a reboot, fastboot.js in the browser is still unable to talk to your phone and unlock the bootloader and/or flash the installation it's your hardware at that point.
22:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Need to go.
22:19:16 <TheJollyRoger> *and by hardware, I mean the cable or the computer's USB slots.
22:19:20 <Bughat33> Ok thanks for all the help.
22:23:07 <Bughat33> I'll make the udev changes and test on my other type-c port and if that doesn't work I see if I can pick up an official pixel type-c cable.
22:29:18 <Bughat33> I tried your kludge and the web install is downloading the image. Thanks a whole bunch.
22:30:19 <Bughat33> Bye, I might be back depending on outcomes.
22:51:47 <warmjuice[m]> bye
