00:02:09 <chile09[m]> Is it even possible to turn the cell modem off without a hardware switch?
00:21:30 <timetravelingman> <chile09[m] "Is it even possible to turn the "> Yeah you just smash your phone to pieces
00:21:44 <timetravelingman> That's what I did, and so far no one has hacked my Gmail account
00:24:08 <chile09[m]> I mean without destroying the phone or removing the battery
00:34:54 <jj1013[m]> <chile09[m] "I mean without destroying the ph"> By that, he means that there is no way.
00:53:16 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: airplane mode.
00:54:19 <TheJollyRoger> That's what airplane mode does.
00:55:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's funny how everyone loves certain phones because of hardware kill switches
00:55:17 <Railgun_Lover[m]> When you can do the same thing by pressing a button
00:56:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hardware switches are a gimmick. If your phone is compromised or insecure to the point where you can no longer trust the operating system and need to physically excise components from it, you should not be using that phone.
00:57:53 <TheJollyRoger> The rest is bikeshedding.
01:03:22 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hardware switches are a gimmick."> Shouldn't the device always be considered compromised? Actors can pop whatever they want, whenever they want, having the ability to say, cut the mic seems like a great feature?
01:30:49 <skwisgaar[m]> Dylanger: doesn’t that create a tricky situation though? If you always assume your device is compromised, would you want to use your phone at all?
01:39:40 <chrysalis[m]> Hardware switches are also great since you might not trust yourself. The possibility of you mistakenly taking a photo or recording an audio is significantly lower with them
01:41:58 <chrysalis[m]> I have hardware restrictions not because of software, but because of humans
01:59:30 <chile09[m]> TheJollyRoger: what does airplane mode do exactly
02:01:44 <chile09[m]> So what does GrapheneOS do exactly to disconnect from baseband modem
02:04:17 <chile09[m]> Is the librem 5 better than a grapheneOS phone because of the hardware switch
02:07:38 <senecow[m]> <TheJollyRoger "@lp4678 if you delete a user pro"> Is the work profile less secure because it uses the same token as the user profile?
02:37:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> The new pixel 5 is a little out of my price range. I’m thinking of getting the pixel 4 or 4xl. If I bought a pixel 4 instead of a 5, how long would support for the device last?
03:06:39 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: if the device is always considered compromised, then there is no point in having it, that's the thing.
03:07:48 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Airplane mode stops the cellphone modem from broadcasting or recieving, and no, the Librem 5 is going to give you roughly 2005 era security with no mandatory access controls, no meaningful security model, and an extremely out of date SoC.
03:22:42 <chile09[m]> Why doesn't grapheme have FSF street cred?
03:22:58 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: because the FSF live in the past.
03:23:37 <TheJollyRoger> They assume that binary firmware is perfectly OK as long as it's permanent, because they consider that "bootROM".
03:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> Nevermind that we live in an era where microcode updates are NECESSARY to mitigate hardware level vulnerabilities because exploits are only going to get better.
03:30:19 <lynn_stephenson[> <TheJollyRoger "Hardware switches are a gimmick."> Isn't a hardware based switch fine for such cases where the OS may be compromised and you may not know?
03:30:42 <TheJollyRoger> lynn_stephenson[: If you don't know, how are you going to activate the countermeasure?
03:30:53 <lynn_stephenson[> It is a permission model, at the hardware
03:30:56 <somenerd[m]> I mean, if the OS is compromised, your camera is the least of your problems
03:31:07 <lynn_stephenson[> <somenerd[m] "I mean, if the OS is compromised"> Not in all cases.
03:31:18 <somenerd[m]> Example?
03:31:37 <TheJollyRoger> lynn_stephenson[: it's nice to think about in theory, but in practice, it falls apart once you realize a compromised phone can simply decide to wait until it gets network again before exfiltrating what it needs to exfiltrate.
03:32:19 <somenerd[m]> Camera might be ok though, and afaik sound can be recorded using the sensors
03:32:27 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "lynn_stephenson: it's nice to th"> It can't control time, say if you were talking to someone, it can't "just wait" until you re-enable the mics etc
03:33:01 <Dylanger[m]> Having the option, is better than not having the option
03:33:22 <TheJollyRoger> Sure it's nice to have the option, but it's not a panacea, nor does it allow you to distrust the device.
03:33:41 <Dylanger[m]> It gives the user more control over what the device is privy to
03:33:41 <Dylanger[m]> Again inb4 screen, sensors etc can be used as mics
03:33:52 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Sure it's nice to have the optio"> You should always distrust the device
03:33:54 <Dylanger[m]> Always
03:34:43 <timetravelingman> Hey guys just dropping by to ask a question real quick, should I always distrust the device?
03:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: if I wanted to distrust the device, I would throw it in a fire and go live on a sustenance farm somewhere out in the country.
03:35:29 <Dylanger[m]> Go on then
03:35:40 <Dylanger[m]> There's always a compromise
03:35:44 <timetravelingman> Dylanger agrees, he's sending Matrix messages via carrier pigeon
03:36:51 <chile09[m]> Its really just about distrust of the baseband and cell modem
03:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: The fact that I'm not doing that right now, shows that I trust my devices to an extent.
03:38:24 <chile09[m]> If you can't trust the cell modem you should be able to disconnect it
03:38:34 <Dylanger[m]> "To an extent", the ability to physically cut mics etc would allow for that "extent" to be changed
03:39:13 <chile09[m]> Its really just the cell modem
03:39:28 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: Like I said, it'd be nice, but without a clear threat model, it's not a panacea.
03:39:39 <chile09[m]> Because that's what creates an untrusted connection
03:40:22 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Again, the cell modem is isolated via a System Memory Management Unit, and all Android apps require the use of TLS. Only SMS and texts, and websites that are in plaintext are unencrypted.
03:41:04 <chile09[m]> Can you explain the SMMU
03:41:07 <TheJollyRoger> If you own a chip forensics device, you're welcome to laser cut the traces on the die between the radio processor and the host, but that's up to you.
03:41:11 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: Again, the cell modem i"> Technically the Kernel brings the Modem up, could be possible for Graphene to not bring the modem up at all
03:41:22 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: yeah, it'd be possible.
03:42:46 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: So, with memory management, the way it's done is that memory access outside the host is emulated via the driver in the kernel. So this means, the cell processor actually doesn't have direct access to memory. It can see what the driver in the kernel presents it with, or write to what the driver in the kernel allows it to write to.
03:43:19 <TheJollyRoger> In essence, its access to host memory is virtualized.
03:44:03 <TheJollyRoger> System Memory Management has been standard on most android phones since the early to mid 2010s, but most privacy enthusiasts haven't got the memo yet, because this is a popular thing for marketing to hang its hat on.
03:44:15 <TheJollyRoger> Since it sounds SCARY AND IMPRESSIVE AND DANGEROUS!
03:45:04 <Dylanger[m]> I wanna row hammer from the modem now
03:45:38 <TheJollyRoger> In any case, the cellular modem is distrusted by the operating system, and if you want to harden the driver, the code is available to do so, it's in the kernel.
03:46:38 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you were to compromise the cell modem, on GrapheneOS the cell modem is not state carrying, so given the phone's verified boot, you could simply reboot the phone and that should revert it to a known good state.
03:50:30 <sphinx[m]> @honorablepee why not the 4a? It will be supported a bit longer than 4 / 4 XL and it's among the recommended ones: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
03:50:32 <TheJollyRoger> In any case, chile09[m] just remember that with respect to baseband exploits, it's not 2010 anymore.
03:50:41 <TheJollyRoger> That was eleven years ago.
03:50:54 <chile09[m]> What if you just want to turn the cell modem off
03:51:04 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: then use Airplane mode.
03:51:22 <TheJollyRoger> That's what it's there for.
03:51:41 <chile09[m]> So that turns the cell modem off?
03:52:00 <TheJollyRoger> It turns it off for cell frequencies, but allows you to use WiFi.
03:52:04 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: then use Airplane mode."> AP doesn't power down the modem
03:52:31 <TheJollyRoger> You're correct, the code for it is separately sandboxed for WiFi and Airplane Mode. If it turned the radio off entirely there would be no WiFi.
03:52:56 <TheJollyRoger> As Dylanger[m]  has suggested, you could fork GrapheneOS, and skip modem bringup which would leave the radio dead. But that would mean you would need to use an external WiFi dongle.
03:53:24 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "In any case, chile09 just rememb"> Also what's this insinuating?
03:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: That phones have mitigations for baseband-to-host exploits.
03:54:56 <Dylanger[m]> Ahhhhh right, fair enough, indeed they did, it's still a shame memory is shared with the AP
03:55:19 <TheJollyRoger> A more expensive solution would be for you to pry the phone open, ask Qualcomm for the mask or reverse-engineer the chip, delid it, then laser-cut the traces between the modem chip and the CPU, then reseal it. I can't guarantee that the chip would work for very long post-modification.
03:55:49 <TheJollyRoger> It might work for a few seconds to a couple minutes at full power, depending on how lucky you get.
03:55:52 <Dylanger[m]> <TheJollyRoger "As Dylanger  has suggested, you "> WNCSS != MSS, WiFi would would fine, you'd just need to be creative with MAC Addresses
03:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> So you might need a large stack of them.
03:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> Dylanger[m]: huh, I see.
03:57:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> I’m thinking battery life and performance overall as well
04:30:27 <astroanax> Is there a CI for vanadium available somewhere?
05:18:53 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: If you're still here -- I tried MAXS as a workaround for second-profile notification, and it has the same problem as IFTTT. It can capture notification when I'm in the second profile and would send me a message. But when I'm in the first profile, it does not capture the notification, despite the notification showing up when I switched
05:18:54 <Zzzzzz> back to the second profile (I even turned on airplane mode before I switched back, so the notification must came before I switched). When I'm in the first profile, I can talk to the bot which runs in the second profile. So it must be a failure of capturing notification rather than communication.

05:22:54 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> I have a concern that dsn't that impartant here ^^
05:24:02 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> The quick settings tile menu doesn't pull all the way down, which I have seen happen on other androids
05:26:17 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Where is this behavior controlled from? Can it be modified while runninng or is it something at/before build time?
05:46:06 <nikdimitry[m]> Hi all,
05:46:06 <nikdimitry[m]> Is there any experience with building grapheneos (and running it successfully afterwards) on any latest Samsung Note Devices?
05:54:14 <Heuristik[m]> Rahoon GOAWAY: I believe that is dependent on the android skin. Where you using e.g. samsung device before?
06:03:10 <TheJollyRoger> nikdimitry[m]: I unfortunately can't stay to discuss this, but Samsung is hostile to running any operating system on their devices that is not their own. Samsung devices have an E-Fuse that will be burned out and forever mark your device as having unlocked its bootloader as a badge of shame and will not allow relocking of the bootloader on third-party operating systems, which disables verified
06:03:13 <TheJollyRoger> boot and virtually all handset security features that depend on it including hardware bound encryption and keystore.
06:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> So even if you did compile GrapheneOS for that particular target, assuming you could also port the proprietary drivers for the stylus to the kernel and get them to work, the device would be permanently insecure.
06:06:27 <TheJollyRoger> nikdimitry[m]: If you'd like to know what handsets GrapheneOS supports or could be made to support, the best place to visit is https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support and give that a read; the requirements for supporting GrapheneOS include a rekeyable bootloader with full vendor co-operation and support for doing so. You won't have any success with that on the Samsung Note series, because
06:06:29 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung has gone out of their way to ensure that that won't happen.
06:18:40 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> <Heuristik[m] "Rahoon GOAWAY: I believe that is"> I've seen it on samsung and huawei phones before. I also had a lineageOS LG-G2 that did that.
06:22:09 <Heuristik[m]> Rahoon GOAWAY Samsung customized Android so it does that. AOSP (on wich Graphene is based) keeps the quick settings on top, though.
06:30:06 <nikdimitry[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nikdimitry: I unfortunately can'"> Thanks for a detailed explanation! I know that Page, but didnt know about efuse and loosing security Features on newer Samsungs after rooting.
08:15:45 <dazinism> Zzzzzz: thats a bit disappointing and somewhat unexpected. Wonder exactly how its getting stuck.
08:16:46 <dazinism> I think its something that some people would use if it could be fixed.
08:17:29 <dazinism> Think it could be good to open an issue it the GrapheneOS tracker
08:17:47 <dazinism> Could maybe explore further with logcat.
08:18:02 <dazinism> See what gets logged when
08:18:46 <dazinism> Guess theres a chance may even be able to get it fixed upstream in AOSP
08:22:28 <dazinism> Android Users are designed for multiple people to use a device rather than for the same person to compartmentalize their activities.
08:23:32 <somenerd[m]> Don’t think that upstream would fix it, due to the purpose of profiles
08:24:01 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS could include a toggle of some sort, to enable notifs appearing on the owner
08:24:47 <somenerd[m]> Which requires a password from each profile to allow notifs to appear on the owner profile
08:24:51 <dazinism> Yeah maybe not. But its not completely unreasonable to think a secondary user may want to set something up to react to a notification, as the main user does
08:25:49 <dazinism> The fact that AOSP keeps everything running and they are arriving etc. just some small part stops apps seeing them
08:26:20 <dazinism> Given AOSP is designed for all kinds of devices
08:26:51 <somenerd[m]> >Yeah maybe not. But its not completely unreasonable to think a secondary user may want to set something up to react to a notification, as the main user does
08:26:51 <somenerd[m]> True
08:26:59 <dazinism> Auto, Internet of Things etc. etc.
08:28:38 <dazinism> I'm thinking it may not be huge amounts of work to change things so this worked, as everything is basically there.
08:29:00 <somenerd[m]> Secondary profile notifications?
08:29:14 <somenerd[m]> Or them appearing on the owner profile?
08:30:42 <dazinism> Yeah appears to get stuck where an app with permission to read notifications doesn't get to see them till the user is foregrounded.
08:31:00 <dazinism> Even though they have arrived and the app with permission to view is active
08:31:32 <somenerd[m]> After ending the session?
08:32:20 <dazinism> No. Just switching to a different user. This secondary profile still running in background
08:33:33 <somenerd[m]> I think that this is more relevant to AOSP, there might be an issue on their gerrit
08:33:34 <dazinism> If you read the message from Zzzzz three hours back they explain
08:38:48 <somenerd[m]> I’m thinking the reason why the notification didn’t work was because the profile was frozen in some way (maybe due to being in the background)
08:39:25 <somenerd[m]> Not sure though
08:40:21 <dazinism> Thing is the way they've tested they've confirmed the notification arrives before they switch - because the turned on aeroplane mode before switching
08:41:47 <dazinism> Also the can talk to the bot/app that should be receiving the notification while the phone is switched to a different profile
08:43:22 <dazinism> If this worked it provides a way to make multi-user more useful just by adding apps
08:43:52 <somenerd[m]> I think that OS support would be preferable
08:44:13 <dazinism> Stand alone apps are a better  way to bring extra functionality rather than deep OS changes
08:44:46 <somenerd[m]> The app would be a bit privileged though (but that wouldn’t be a big problem imo)
08:45:34 <dazinism> As any GrapheneOS changes to the OS components could break as AOSP changes
08:45:56 <dazinism> If its core functionality that needs fixing before updates can be released
08:46:02 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, would need to be maintained as well (due to the breakage)
08:46:21 <dazinism> Makes it much harder to move quickly to new android version
08:46:27 <somenerd[m]> Depends on how simple the code is to add support
08:47:30 <dazinism> Theres no telling what will change with a new AOSP version and its always a whole load of work to port GrapheneOS
08:48:45 <dazinism> Adding functionality by independent apps, that use standard AOSP features means theres no extra work when porting time comes
08:49:42 <somenerd[m]> I think that code still needs to be added to support background notifs though
08:49:46 <dazinism> Or if there will be there will be loads of notice. AOSP doesn't make changes that will break apps without giving a load of notice
08:50:07 <ChristopherTrimb> I'm interested to see how the GrapheneOS team evaluates a Google's new CPU vs. Qualcomm, if these rumours are true.
08:50:07 <ChristopherTrimb> https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/everything-we-know-google-whitechapel-gs101-pixel-6/
08:50:28 <ChristopherTrimb> * I'm interested to see how the GrapheneOS team evaluates Google's new CPU vs. Qualcomm, if these rumours are true.
08:50:28 <ChristopherTrimb> https://9to5google.com/2021/04/09/everything-we-know-google-whitechapel-gs101-pixel-6/
08:50:48 <dazinism> somenerd Yeah I guess ideally can get that changed in AOSP
08:50:49 * somenerd[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/JYJGgHmyOBvPwDSbLHwYJRIw/message.txt >
08:51:06 <dazinism> I imagine they will
08:51:30 <dazinism> Its something they take a lot of effort to make possible
08:51:41 <somenerd[m]> Most of the motivation for alternative OS support probably came from Google
08:52:45 <somenerd[m]> >somenerd Yeah I guess ideally can get that changed in AOSP
08:52:45 <somenerd[m]> Something better could be to get notifs in owner profiles, but that would place trust in the owner, and should be implemented securely
08:53:31 <somenerd[m]> Probably won’t be implemented in AOSP, given the purpose of profiles
08:53:53 <dazinism> https://nitter.snopyta.org/shawnwillden/status/1281355422432141313
08:55:26 <dazinism> somenerd: yeah think its unlikely to get that functionality built in. But we are basically talking about making it possible to write an app to make that possible.
08:55:57 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, it would probably need some form of OS code change though
08:57:13 <dazinism> Make that a system app and it ends up being pretty much the same thing as it being built in. Many/most core functionality in AOSP is done by system apps
08:58:09 <dazinism> Functioning as other apps do, using the permission model etc.
08:58:47 <dazinism> Some have higher privileges than a user installed app can ever get
08:59:29 <somenerd[m]> Could work, would probably need some form of consent from the other profile
08:59:29 <dazinism> But they still act in the same environment
08:59:56 <somenerd[m]> To avoid increasing trust in the owner profile
09:01:27 <dazinism> Everything is there pretty much. Just need an app to use the local (on device) networking to securely send the notifications to another app (I guess a different instance of the same app) in the profile where you want to receive them
09:02:22 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, an app could work
09:02:34 <somenerd[m]> (Specifically a system app)
09:02:56 <dazinism> Could also enable file transfers between profiles in a similar fashion
09:04:13 <dazinism> Just need to free up where  notifications are currently getting stuck in the secondary user

12:03:38 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend moving to something that works properly
12:04:31 <GhostSplinterSix> Legacy?
12:04:31 <GhostSplinterSix> Bummer. I have a Sprint tower (literally) across the street from my house. What provider(s) would you recommend?
12:05:46 <strcat[m]> https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/28/t-mobile-warns-sprint-customers-of-upcoming-legacy-cellular-network-shutdown/
12:05:51 <strcat[m]> Sprint is a legacy network that's being shut down
12:05:57 <strcat[m]> and is no longer meaningfully supported
12:06:22 <strcat[m]> not relevant to us anymore
12:06:36 <strcat[m]> if you're on Sprint you need to move on whether you use GrapheneOS or not
12:06:44 <Camel41> Hey! In the back of my head somewhere there is this memory of custom roms not being able to produce nice pictures since some prop. code that does image magic. Is that still a thing? (Pixel 4a 5G if relevant)
12:07:21 <strcat[m]> picture quality in any given app has always been the same as the stock OS for GrapheneOS
12:07:24 <strcat[m]> since it started in 2014
12:07:35 <Camel41> Yeah my memory is back from Cyageon iirc
12:07:48 <Camel41> Was that a thing once or does my memory serve me ill?
12:07:54 <strcat[m]> not relevant to GrapheneOS
12:07:57 <strcat[m]> channel is about GrapheneOS
12:07:58 <strcat[m]> not other OSes
12:08:09 <Camel41> Right. Thanks for the straight answer
12:08:52 <strcat[m]> most camera apps don't match the features of Google Camera but that's not about the OS
12:09:08 <GhostSplinterSix> <strcat[m] "if you're on Sprint you need to "> What provider would you recommend for GrapheneOS?
12:09:11 <strcat[m]> same app, same image / video quality
12:09:33 <strcat[m]> GhostSplinterSix: regular T-Mobile network is fine
12:09:36 <strcat[m]> Sprint is not
12:09:49 <strcat[m]> any other carrier should be fine for basic functionality
12:09:54 <Camel41> Okay cool, thank you. Is all the image processing done by the app or does the OS have something to say about it as well?
12:10:19 <strcat[m]> Camel41: the hardware does most of the work
12:10:32 <strcat[m]> the OS exposes the hardware capabilities
12:10:32 <strcat[m]> some apps take better advantage of them than others
12:10:34 <strcat[m]> some apps do a lot of work in software
12:10:40 <strcat[m]> same app, same image / video quality
12:10:48 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS vs. stock OS is the same image / video quality in any given app
12:10:52 <strcat[m]> since it started in 2014
12:10:54 <strcat[m]> no differences
12:11:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Camel41: the OS doesn't really affect your picture quality
12:11:22 <Camel41> Yeah I got that. Was just curious about the general (hardware) process of taking a image. Might be the wrong irc to ask that
12:12:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have the same HAL that stock uses and we don't modify it
12:12:15 <GhostSplinterSix> <strcat[m] "GhostSplinterSix: regular T-Mobi"> I thought said T-Mobile doesn't really support it?
12:13:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google camera app on stock is a special app with access to some extra hardware features
12:13:10 <strcat[m]> GhostSplinterSix: I don't understand what you're claiming now
12:13:12 <strcat[m]> a detailed answer was given
12:13:28 <strcat[m]> don't use Sprint, the network is being shut down and it always had messed up proprietary bloatware requirements
12:13:37 <strcat[m]> you have to stop using Sprint whether or not you use GrapheneOS
12:13:50 <strcat[m]> it's dead, sorry, not a relevant topic for the channel beyond that
12:14:19 <fomijafi[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I thought said T-Mobile doesn't "> He meant T mobile doesn't support the legacy sprint network. But t mobile's network works fine with grapheneos
12:14:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !The has joined the Telegram Group!
12:14:45 <GhostSplinterSix> <fomijafi[m] "He meant T mobile doesn't suppor"> Ah, okay. I appreciate it.
12:14:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!The> Hello
12:15:04 <Camel41> anupritaisno1[m]: Sounds like a very monopolistic thing to do. Just to not call it a dick move.
12:16:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Camel41: yes it is
12:16:55 <Camel41> Is it a goal or target for Graphene to expose those functions to apps or is it not relevant since no gain for security/privacy
12:17:52 <strcat[m]> it's not safe to expose that functionality to arbitrary apps
12:18:12 <Camel41> Sounds like a very clear no. Understandable if its not safe
12:18:15 <strcat[m]> we plan to remove it for Google Camera eventually
12:18:32 <Camel41> May I ask what the potential issues might be?
12:18:54 <strcat[m]> it's privileged functionality not designed to be exposed to untrusted code
12:19:01 <strcat[m]> it's not safe to expose that to arbitrary apps, we won't
12:19:13 <strcat[m]> it's not "monopolistic" that they didn't expose unsafe functionality to arbitrary apps
12:19:28 <strcat[m]> Google Camera is only for Pixels...
12:20:31 <Camel41> The Pixel is my first Android, I am not aware of any other camera apps than the one from google for now
12:21:10 <Camel41> Google Camera requires the play services and is therefor not available on Graphene right?
12:21:47 <strcat[m]> the channel is about GrapheneOS
12:22:13 <dazinism> Camel41: there are hacky ways to get old versions working, but safest/best bet is to use Open Camera
12:22:16 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you aren't using GrapheneOS
12:22:51 <Camel41> I am thinking about switching to it, I read all the website and found nothing about the Google Camera, hence my quesion
12:23:02 <dazinism> Its not quite as polished / nice to use as Google Camera, but can still take great photos
12:23:09 <Camel41> Thank you!
12:23:10 <strcat[m]> Camel41: it's not clear what you're actually asking
12:23:20 <alex-resist> Camel41 did you see this: https://grapheneos.org/usage#camera =
12:23:57 <Camel41> Yes, and there was no mention of the google camera, thats why I was asking if it is possible to install or not, but dazinism already answered that. Thank you dazinism!
12:24:54 <strcat[m]> it's possible to install Google Camera
12:25:00 <strcat[m]> it won't work without hacks though
12:25:16 <strcat[m]> and we don't recommend doing it since it's likely to break in the future in a way that can't be hacked around
12:25:26 <Camel41> Which would probably compromise something, got it
12:25:32 <strcat[m]> the ability for it to use the special hardware capabilities will also be dropped
12:26:34 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not specifically meant for Pixels, I think people are confused about that and misunderstand the project
12:40:19 <dazinism> Guess the camera and Google Camera app quality and features are a big selling point of the phone that Google put a load of work into developing and promoting
12:42:00 <dazinism> In a way its a bit sad to not benefit from all that if you use a Pixel, but clearly GrapheneOS isn't a project that has the goal of providing the best smartphone camera experience possible
12:43:13 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's a side effect of Google making their apps with hard dependency with Play services
12:43:26 <dazinism> Even so, when using Open Camera you still get amazing photos on a Pixel
12:43:26 <helloworldkk87[m> I dont even use camera
12:44:06 <dazinism> When I look back at smartphone photos I took 5-10 years back
12:44:23 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> * It's a side effect of Google making their apps have hard dependency with Play services
12:44:46 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> <Heuristik[m] "Rahoon GOAWAY Samsung customized"> Where is this customization done?
12:44:54 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Or more likely there's something important I'm missing
12:46:04 <dazinism> Rahoon GOAWAY: I don't think its possible to change the way the notifications area and quick tiles work/display by installing an app.
12:46:22 <dazinism> ....actually guess it kind of could
12:46:46 <dazinism> But it would need high privileges to be able to offer all that functionality
12:47:29 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Aaaha so it would need be rooted....
12:47:39 <dazinism> No
12:47:47 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Hmm?
12:47:57 <dazinism> Just the app that was supplying all that would have to be full screen
12:48:15 <dazinism> Read notifications
12:48:35 <dazinism> Have high privileges to be able to turn on aeroplane mode
12:49:01 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Oh OK, like an overlay thingy instead of actually changing the base program that is the notification shade
12:49:17 <dazinism> (Think would need to be enabled as an 'accessibility service' to be able to do aeroplane mode)
12:49:58 <dazinism> Granting an app the ability to act as an accessibility services gives it more power over the phone than you
12:50:27 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> OK, and that is a security risk, right?
12:50:39 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> even if the app is open-source and you can verify the code
12:50:50 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Accessibility_services
12:51:42 <dazinism> It means you have to trust the app developer not to be malicious. Also to be careful not to be compromised, or have bugs in their app that could be compromised.
12:52:00 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Well what about actually chaning the program that does it then? Like it was there in LOS for example
12:52:38 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> So could I find where that piece of code is in Lineage, replace Graphene's current thing with that, and build?
12:53:28 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> *using lineage as an example here, I'm just wondering if there is a way to change this thing that seems to be "baked in"
12:55:18 <dazinism> Rahoon GOAWAY: its possible, but would likely take a bit of work. Then you need to build every new release of Graphene yourself and update. Also would need to build Auditor app yourself and run a remote attestation server if you use them (they are useful)
12:55:39 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> whoa ok
12:56:21 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> If I manage to do it, what would be the chances that I could get it merged with the grapheneOS project?
12:57:08 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Do they pay much attention to things like this or all focus is on privacy and security?
13:01:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> For how long will a 4a be compatible?
13:01:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> Excuse me I meant to say how long will I have support if I buy one?
13:03:25 <helloworldkk87[m> GrapheneOS supports it as long as Google supports it
13:05:41 <catfish[m]> 4a is August 2023 https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705
13:08:36 <helloworldkk87[m> Should rather get Pixel5
13:08:36 <helloworldkk87[m> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
13:08:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> I can second this , I was using a USB a to USB c cable because the pixel 5 comes with a double ended USB c cable. I had problems , so changed to a better quality cablsnd it was sorted
13:20:49 <dazinism> Should note dates are minimal guaranteed,  there is some chance may get longer. 5 only gets a few month more than 4a
13:24:39 <dazinism> Rahoon GOAWAY: That kind of stuff really isn't a priority. The benefits are limited as is developer time to review and maintain changes.  If it was clean / minimal changes there is some chance it could be merged, but not at all certain.
13:30:04 <hypergenesis[m]> Is it likely that GrapheneOS will support the upcoming Pixel 5a?
13:32:25 <Zzzzzz> dazinism: >Think it could be good to open an issue it the GrapheneOS tracker
13:32:25 <Zzzzzz> > Could maybe explore further with logcat.
13:32:26 <Zzzzzz> Sure! I'm no Android dev, so... no idea how to logcat for this. But I can open an issue and see what people think
13:32:29 <helloworldkk87[m> I think so yes
13:33:06 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> OK I see.
13:33:06 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Thanks for all the help and explanations dazinism.
13:35:24 <chile09[m]> How is it possible to write code for the cellular baseband if it's closed source?
13:35:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> Too expensive for me. Unless the performance is a big difference
13:35:53 <chile09[m]> Was the binary reverse engineered?
13:40:00 <Blechpirat[m]> hi everybody, I just flashed the Google Stock ROM on my Pixel 5, added a phone number to the esim, checked that the phone is working, used webinstaller to install graphene and graphene thinks i have no mobile connection. What did I do wrong?
13:46:32 * akc3n[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YSZJWzCpRSfupQvnvTdiUIHy/message.txt >
13:48:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> Is the performance difference that big for grapheneos on a 4a?
13:51:11 <Guest87827> howdy
13:51:55 <Guest87827> I am in the process of trying to install bramble onto a pixel 4a with 5g
13:52:46 <Guest87827> time before it hung.  I have gone back and restarted flash
13:53:16 <Guest87827> I think what happened is the computer did the stop screen.
13:53:33 <Guest87827> powersaving devices are a pain for working at lower level installs
13:54:05 <Guest87827> now I have gotten to flashed bramble  to device
13:59:36 <Guest87827> ah,  working.  You might add to the screen regarding how to for web install that the little boxes are not instructions, but buttons.  I guess I am the only one slow enough not to release that was what was going on.
14:00:11 <Guest87827> off to fiddle with graphene OS on phone.  got passed setting a screen display pin
14:00:16 <Guest87827> bye all
14:01:38 <helloworldkk87[m> Umm ok
14:03:44 <Blechpirat[m]> I was missing a step with my esim. Didn't know that I had to turn on D2DS. After turning it on, everything seems to work.
14:07:04 <g405t[m]> quick question guys, if theres tampered hardware in my pixel is graphene able to detect it ?
14:09:14 <helloworldkk87[m> Not sure about the hardware but Auditor app can detect things like if youre bootloader is unlocked etc, check out https://attestation.app/about
14:16:23 <g405t[m]> yeahh I know the auditor app but Just wondered if some bad actor is putting tampered pixels on the market would there be a way to figure it out
14:23:00 <cc53> trying to load grapheneos on a Pixel 4a and having problems getting started.  Using Window 10, Chrome browser and the web install process but can't find the Pixel that is connected via USB.  Any suggestions?
14:25:29 <cc53> I didn't see any optional updates for fastboot.  the phone is in fastboot mode.
14:27:48 <cc53> selecting unlock returns no compatible device found.  I hear the USB recognition sound when I plug into the USB-C cable.
14:30:18 <pkgbuild[m]> check the logs! you should probably install the USB drivers
14:30:53 <nscnt[m]> cc53: Did you check for the updates *after* you booted in the bootloader menu and connecting the device to the pc?
14:32:52 <pkgbuild[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
14:33:09 <Blechpirat[m]> something else is weird this time. everytime I reboot, I'm told that I installed a different operation system (check g.co/ABH) - i need to click power twice to actually boot.
14:33:25 <Blechpirat[m]> wasn't that way the first time I played around with graphene.
14:33:34 <Blechpirat[m]> Did I forget something?
14:36:04 <pkgbuild[m]> you shouldnt click at all
14:37:11 <pkgbuild[m]> it is a normal info if you click once it give you the time to read carefully, twice to continue, if you don't click it just goes. read the FAQ's
14:38:24 <Blechpirat[m]> thanks!
14:38:31 <pkgbuild[m]> it happen always with whatever ROM you install on your pixel devices, it is a security notification gived by google anyway
14:39:25 <Blechpirat[m]> i can't remember seeing it the last time I tried graphene, that's why I'm wondering. and that was just last week...
14:40:04 <pkgbuild[m]>  * it happen always with whatever ROM you install on your pixel devices, it is a security notification given by google anyway
14:47:25 <troypatrick[m]> Hey since the latest graphene update my phone has no cellular connection.  Only seeing emergency calls
14:47:36 <troypatrick[m]> Any tips on troubleshooting that
15:00:45 <signalarch[m]> troypatrick the cellular data toggle is on correct? I know mine has randomly turned off and it confuses me for awhile. You might look through this and see if there's anything helpful https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/538
15:02:28 <troypatrick[m]> Will check it out thanks for the link
15:10:41 <DerrickSchwabe[m> Also having cell connection issues after installing the latest update!  (Fido, Canada)
15:22:10 <dazinism> Something you can try is check the Access Point Names in Settings > Network > Mobile Network
15:22:28 <dazinism> You may have a choice and a different one may work
15:22:52 <dazinism> Randomly happened to a friend recently. They hadn't done an OS update
15:23:01 <dazinism> Guess their network changed something
15:26:54 <DerrickSchwabe[m> thx, I tried changing to the one other alt APN it showed but to no avail :/
15:27:27 <troypatrick[m]> Ya derrick I'm having same problem since latest update
15:27:51 <troypatrick[m]> Tried all trobleshooting to no avail
15:27:52 <troypatrick[m]> I'm on Rogers network (canada)

16:14:44 <jjj> I realize this isn't an urgent privacy/security issue, but after the last update all custom gcam mods stopped working (hangs on loading screen)
16:15:08 <jjj> did this happen to anyone else? any ideas why?  tried reinstalling and double checking permissions
16:15:57 <jjj> or should such a question go to graphneneos-offtopic

17:38:29 <lunch> hi all
17:38:36 <lunch> question
17:39:18 <lunch> I just installed grapheneOS and got it mostly working on straight talk CDMA (verizon) network.  the plan I have has unlimited data.
17:39:38 <lunch> data is not flowing yet.
17:40:12 <lunch> I can do WiFi on it.
17:40:21 <fretegi> i tihnk mobile data is disabled by default
17:40:35 <lunch> I had the same issue with Android when I first started.
17:40:36 <strcat[m]> no
17:41:02 <fretegi> settings > network & Internet > mobile network > Mobile data, is that one?
17:41:11 <fretegi> on*
17:41:17 <lunch> I also see, when powering up.  Your phone is starting another operating system
17:41:19 <entry1> <lunch "I just installed grapheneOS and "> Did you confirm you have the right carrier APN settings?
17:41:30 <lunch> I only have one APN
17:41:43 <entry1> <lunch "I also see, when powering up.  Y"> That is correct, it will say that.
17:42:12 <lunch> I seem to recall that starting up is correct.  I can live with it
17:42:12 <entry1> <lunch "I only have one APN"> Correct, did you make sure you have the right carrier APN settings?
17:45:27 <lunch> tracfone vzwentp
17:46:15 <lunch> the question is,  I could ask straight talk technical, but I am not sure if they would not get weirded out when they looked down the line.

17:51:48 <lunch> thanks
17:52:12 <lunch> I suspect, all I need to do is wait overnight.
17:52:34 <lunch> however thanks
18:56:40 <jahway603[m]> I'm new to GrapheneOS but wanted to say thank you to all those who developed this as it has been an amazing experience so far. 😄
19:06:04 <GhostSplinterSix> <jahway603[m] "I'm new to GrapheneOS but wanted"> I'm new, too. 😄
19:08:33 <arcibald[m]> So, is there any secure/trusted app for remote control pf devices with GrapheneOS? I need it to remote wipe some phone if needed.
19:09:48 <Xcutioner[m]> Has anyone had problems with the straighttalk service with data?  I have tried both Verizon and ATT sims with no Data for either.
19:19:33 <dnull> Xcutioner[m]: Do you have the correct APN info?
19:44:19 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <arcibald[m] "So, is there any secure/trusted "> You can just keep your phone with you🙄
19:44:42 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Like 90% of ppl do
19:46:50 <arcibald[m]> <CrowmacMcCarthy[ "You can just keep your phone wit"> Sometimes you can lose your phone, one way or another.
19:47:19 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Wiping your phone remotely is more likely to fail than wiping it physically
19:47:52 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Plus if it is encrypted, losing it shouldn't matter too much

19:55:25 <strcat[m]> arcibald: an attacker that obtains your phone will turn it off, first thing
19:55:52 <strcat[m]>  * arcibald: an attacker that obtains your phone and wants to prevent it connecting to a network can remove the SIM card or turn it off
19:56:23 <strcat[m]> arcibald: so it's pretty pointless to assume there will be a network connection, even a non-technical phone thief will know to remove SIM and/or turn it off
19:56:24 <Blechpirat[m]> I'm trying to use an usb cable  to connect my graphenos-phone to a win10 box - want to copy over some music. But win won't detect the phone as a drive.
19:57:02 <strcat[m]> arcibald: if they intend to exploit the device then they probably wouldn't turn it off
19:57:07 <strcat[m]> but they could still remove SIM
19:57:22 <strcat[m]> and it's not like it'll be connected via Wi-Fi if it was taken from you
19:57:47 <entry1> <Blechpirat[m] "I'm trying to use an usb cable  "> Have to enable data transfer. Pull down on the top of the phone and change the connected settings
19:57:53 <arcibald[m]> <strcat[m] "arcibald: so it's pretty pointle"> I have Pixel 5 and GrapheneOS on it, esim works fine. So, if my phone is locked and without real sim - he can't do anything.
19:58:14 <Blechpirat[m]> @entry1 thanks, I did that of course, but to no avail.
19:59:16 <entry1> <Blechpirat[m] "@entry1 thanks, I did that of co"> Hmm. Did you check to see if your Windows machine has all the OS updates? That could be the issue, or the cable itself
19:59:22 <arcibald[m]> And sorry about misinformations. I do not claim anything. I just thinking and research.
19:59:35 <strcat[m]> arcibald: they can put it in a faraday bag
20:00:17 <strcat[m]> or they can turn it off (if they don't mind losing the opportunity of exploiting it when a profile was active)
20:00:43 <strcat[m]> ideally they obtain the device when it is already turned off (or freshly booted and not logged into any profile)
20:01:06 <strcat[m]> arcibald: strongly recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
20:01:06 <Blechpirat[m]> <entry1 "Hmm. Did you check to see if you"> It worked just fine with the stock rom. also works (same cable, too, on my xiomi with lineage on it.
20:02:09 <entry1> Can you try a different USB port? I've personally never encountered any issues with accessing the device's storage. The device is currently unlocked correct?
20:02:35 <Blechpirat[m]> its unlocked (if you mean the lock screen, not the boot loader)
20:02:49 <Blechpirat[m]> I tried different ports allready, also different cables
20:03:56 <entry1> Yeah if you enabled data transfer and the phone is unlocked connected to the computer using a good cable, you should be able to find the phone storage in Windows Explorer no problem. Maybe try rebooting your Windows computer and double checking you have it up-to-date with updates.
20:04:11 <arcibald[m]> <strcat[m] "arcibald: they can put it in a f"> Ok, I understand what you want to say. Thank you for your answers. I am new GrapheonOS user and have many questions. :)
20:04:32 <Blechpirat[m]> @entry1 brb, rebooting all devices.
20:04:55 <gout[m]> Hello :)  I’ve got a question:
20:04:56 <gout[m]> I've tried to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3 via Windows; afaik I followed all the steps correctly: via ADB I got in the bootloader menu, and did fastboot flashing unlock. So far, so good. I copied the all the extracted files in the ADB folder and hit the flash-all batch data file. My command line pops up shortly but closes a few seconds. Apparently nothing happened. Any ideas what to do? I'm not a tech expert, so
20:04:56 <gout[m]> forgive me if I've made any silly mistakes or missed something obvious ^^
20:05:00 <entry1> Blechpirat gl. Keep us posted
20:05:23 <nscnt[m]> gout: You aren't following the official guide at all
20:05:43 <gout[m]> <nscnt[m] "gout: You aren't following the o"> Okay, what did I do wrong?
20:05:43 <nscnt[m]> gout: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
20:05:53 <nscnt[m]> follow that if you're on windows
20:07:32 <Blechpirat[m]> <entry1 "Blechpirat gl. Keep us posted"> yeah, well, after rebooting both phone and pc, nothing changed.
20:08:17 <entry1> Hopefully someone else can give some insight. Sounds like you are doing everything right for sure
20:09:08 <Blechpirat[m]> Just retried with the lineage-phone - no problem there.
20:09:23 <strcat[m]> gout: you're following an incorrect unofficial guide
20:09:42 <strcat[m]> gout: reboot your computer and remove all the stuff you installed / extracted
20:09:48 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to use adb for anything, among other things
20:10:12 <strcat[m]> gout: sounds like you're following one of the very incorrect and dangerous unofficial install videos
20:10:14 <strcat[m]> please do not use those
20:10:16 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "you aren't supposed to use adb f"> okay, my mistake, thanks for the advice
20:10:33 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "please do not use those"> you hit the nail on the head
20:10:38 <strcat[m]> either use the web installer (recommended) at https://grapheneos.org/install/web or the official command-line install guide at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
20:11:01 <strcat[m]> gout: reboot (to make sure adb daemon isn't running), remove that stuff, uninstall stuff if it made you install stuff
20:11:09 <strcat[m]> and use either web installer or official command-line install guide
20:12:03 <entry1> <gout[m] "you hit the nail on the head "> Don't worry, a lot of is have too. A big tell is when people mention adb or try to do the command line installation steps in command prompt instead of Powershell
20:12:25 <entry1> * Don't worry, a lot of us have too. A big tell is when people mention adb or try to do the command line installation steps in command prompt instead of Powershell. Definitely read the guides in detail
20:16:15 <Blechpirat[m]> okay, everything works on my windows laptop, THAT is weird.
20:16:27 <Blechpirat[m]> So why did my desktop stop talking to my pixel?
20:25:56 <entry1> <Blechpirat[m] "So why did my desktop stop talki"> Do you have all Windows updates installed?
20:26:09 <Blechpirat[m]> yes.
20:26:34 <entry1> Does the desktop recognize the phone at all when plugged in?
20:27:47 <troypatrick[m]> Double check the windows updates
20:27:49 <Blechpirat[m]> device manager sees a google nexus adb interface
20:27:55 <troypatrick[m]> Make sure u select the optional ones to be installed
20:28:01 <troypatrick[m]> Sometimes people overlook that
20:29:08 <Blechpirat[m]> everything is up to date, even the optional ones.
20:29:43 <Blechpirat[m]> can you check how the windows device manager shows your phone?
20:29:53 <Blechpirat[m]> adb interface does not sound right.
20:30:40 <Blechpirat[m]>   but then, the lineage phone is shown as android composite adb interface.
20:30:45 <Blechpirat[m]> and that one works just fine.
20:31:48 <strcat[m]> you should not see anything to do with adb unless you have adb enabled
20:31:58 <strcat[m]> and even if you do that's unrelated to what's used for file transfer
20:32:12 <entry1> If you plug your phone into your computer, it should say Pixel in the windows explorer (even if you didn't unlock it or enable data transfer). Shouldn't have to go into adb interface or anything different. If your desktop is missing this step, then it is either a software or hardware issue with your desktop. If it is recognizing other phones, then your desktop has a software issue.
20:32:19 <strcat[m]> production device shouldn't have adb enabled and you shouldn't be doing stuff with adb at any point, really
20:33:00 <Blechpirat[m]> i deleted the device in the device manager, and now it works like it should.
20:33:10 <Blechpirat[m]> must have been some kind of driver problem on the windows side.
20:33:24 <entry1> Glad you got it
20:36:19 <Blechpirat[m]> @strcat its not a production phone, but one to fiddle around with.
20:36:37 <Xcutioner[m]> @grAc3tus$uzkC
20:45:21 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "and use either web installer or "> thx, now I've  tried to follow to web installer. OEM unlocking is enabled, Pixel 3 is recognised by PC but when I'm now clicking "unlocking bootloader" I get the error: no device selected. Could that be because I followed an unofficial video installer?
20:47:40 <strcat[m]> gout: what do you mean it's recognized?
20:47:57 <strcat[m]> did you follow the earlier instructions to boot the phone into the bootloader interface?
20:48:37 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "gout: what do you mean it's reco"> I mean first my PC just recognised MTP media device; after i deinstalled the drivers - my PC recognised the phone as Pixel 3

20:52:31 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "did you follow the earlier instr"> than I'm instantly in fastboot mode - that should probably not be the case, should it?
20:53:21 <strcat[m]> gout: you aren't following the instructions there afaict
20:53:25 <strcat[m]> please follow them in order
20:53:29 <strcat[m]> don't skip to pressing the first button
20:55:40 <Cliff[m]> Is there a way to turn on the android 10 password attempt wipe feature on my pixel?
20:56:49 <southron[m]> I don't believe so currently
20:57:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> Didn't even know they existed
21:00:15 <strcat[m]> Cliff: nothing relevant to that was added in Android 10, don't really know what you mean
21:00:50 <strcat[m]> Cliff: first of all, please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
21:01:40 <strcat[m]> there's a rate limit on unlock attempts, with hardware enforcement
21:01:51 <strcat[m]> it quickly throttles to 1 attempt / day
21:03:11 <Xcutioner[m]> dnull I have the correct settings for ATT, but I get no LTE icon or data
21:03:15 <strcat[m]> if you're concerned about someone brute forcing, they can't really do that without being a very sophisticated attacker with a way to exploit / tamper with the secure element, and if they can do that, some software limit on attempts in the OS is not really relevant
21:04:40 <jj1013[m]> Do you know how much security are Samsung devices designed with?
21:04:46 <jj1013[m]> (oops, sorry, should have asked off-topic)
21:05:09 <jj1013[m]>  * (oops, sorry, should have asked in off-topic)
21:06:36 <Cliff[m]> strcat then i believe it is a samsung feature i had it on my old android 10 phone and also on ios
21:06:41 <strcat[m]> the OS does have an internal way to set a limit on unlock attempts but it isn't really useful and there isn't a standard UI for it
21:06:56 <strcat[m]> Cliff: it's not useful due to the existing rate limit, which is implemented in hardware, not just software
21:07:24 <Cliff[m]> Yes i understand i have read up on the titan chip
21:07:36 <strcat[m]> if you even just have a random 6 digit PIN then a brute force is not feasible without compromising the hardware
21:07:41 <strcat[m]>  * if you even just have a random 6 digit PIN then a brute force is not feasible without compromising the secure element
21:07:59 <strcat[m]> which is certainly a lot harder than only compromising the OS / application processor
21:08:15 <strcat[m]> so, don't really see why you'd want an OS enforced limit
21:08:46 <jj1013[m]> Is there any reliable sources to check what smartphones have unpatched exploits or backdoors?
21:08:57 <Cliff[m]> strcat so the feature on other phones is not useful?
21:09:02 <strcat[m]> jj1013.: there's a security patch level
21:09:23 <Cliff[m]> Doesnt it add to security to have it on hardware and software?
21:09:27 <strcat[m]> Cliff: it's not useful with a random PIN due to the rate limit
21:09:46 <strcat[m]> Cliff: the rate limit is respected by the software, doesn't add any security
21:10:32 <strcat[m]> the software doesn't let you make another attempt until the hardware rate limit expires, that doesn't add security
21:10:34 <strcat[m]> it's a UI feature
21:10:45 <strcat[m]> so you know how long to wait and can't attempt before it is allowed
21:10:47 <jj1013[m]> <strcat[m] "jj1013.: there's a security patc"> What's the most recent? Apparently Samsung classifies security patches by date. Mine has a date of February IIRC.
21:10:57 <strcat[m]> jj1013.: there are monthly security patches
21:11:00 <strcat[m]> recommend reading about it
21:11:57 <strcat[m]> 2021-04 is the current month, so the current patch level is 2021-04-05 (2021-04-05 means fully patched, 2021-04-01 means latest SOC driver, SoC firmware, etc. patches missing)
21:12:08 <strcat[m]> patch levels include all prior patch levels by definition
21:12:21 <strcat[m]> 2021-04-01 includes 2021-03-05, 2021-03-01, etc.
21:12:24 <strcat[m]> again recommend reading about it
21:12:40 <strcat[m]> https://source.android.com/security/bulletin
21:13:04 <strcat[m]> that's for AOSP and a lot of standard hardware component firmware / OS support
21:13:37 <strcat[m]> it does not cover all the code / changes vendors add themselves, or hardware/firmware, etc. that's not coordinated as part of it
21:13:55 <strcat[m]> vendors need to have their own monthly bulletins / patches too, beyond the baseline Android ones
21:14:07 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "please follow them in order"> Starting from the first point concering OEM unlocking, it says bootloader is already unlocked. Is that okay?
21:14:44 <strcat[m]> gout: okay so continue on
21:15:04 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#booting-into-the-bootloader-interface
21:15:21 <Cliff[m]> <strcat[m] "Cliff: the rate limit is respect"> I meant the wipe function doesnt it improve security to have 10 attempts to guess a character pass word then the phone wipes itself than a timer?
21:16:15 <strcat[m]> recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
21:16:18 <strcat[m]> look at what it does
21:17:20 <strcat[m]> consider what 1 day / attempt means with even a random 6 digit PIN
21:17:35 <came2complain[m]> <strcat[m] "recommend reading https://graphe"> if you'd get a $ for every time you had to quote this you'd be damn rich
21:18:12 <strcat[m]> Cliff: a max # of attempts enforced by the OS is not really going to make things better
21:18:51 <strcat[m]> exploiting the OS bypasses any OS limits
21:19:06 <strcat[m]> the whole point is that it's encrypted so that doing something like that doesn't get the data
21:19:11 <gout[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/install/w"> I did
21:19:29 <Cliff[m]> <strcat[m] "exploiting the OS bypasses any O"> This makes sense thanks
21:19:39 * gout[m] uploaded an image: (159KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cONcoMvVtHVJfwpYCBsIQPxC/signal-2021-04-19-231741.jpeg >
21:19:55 <strcat[m]> gout: so, keep going, next section about connecting the phone
21:20:01 <strcat[m]> which is not just about connecting the USB cable
21:20:49 <strcat[m]> Cliff: the rate limit of 1 day per attempt (it quickly ramps up to that) is already very limiting even with fairly weak lock methods like a random 6 digit PIN
21:35:55 <Cliff[m]> strcat i read the cryptographic keys for the second profile are deleted from ram after end session are they also overwritten?

23:20:02 <jj1013[m]> Older versions of GCam run without GApps.
23:20:44 <retracey[m]> yeah but it is going to be hard to find a safe APK
23:24:19 <entry1> I never thought I'd ever see so much about the gcam. Really don't see what the big deal is; just to use opencamera... Are the results that significantly different? I don't get it

23:29:36 <retracey[m]> <entry1 "I never thought I'd ever see so "> on pixel 4a yes
23:47:18 <retracey[m]> <jj1013[m] "It is, unless you are using a Ca"> How old?
23:50:31 <retracey[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
23:50:34 <retracey[m]> this looks promising
23:53:52 <retracey[m]> Yep, that works!
23:54:11 <jj1013[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Pengu_Gone_Complicated> Gcam-Se"> Here's a comment from someone
23:54:47 <retracey[m]> Yes and it works great
23:55:00 <retracey[m]> Now I don't need to use microG lets go
23:55:42 <jj1013[m]> <retracey[m] "Now I don't need to use microG l"> Great.
23:56:08 <retracey[m]> wdym?
23:56:24 <retracey[m]> GOS=GrapheneOS? I installed with the website's installer
23:58:54 <jj1013[m]> <retracey[m] "wdym?"> How did you get MicroG working then?
23:59:07 <retracey[m]> It didn't work for anything other than the camera
23:59:23 <jj1013[m]> There is no way to get it working without root ─ with which you achieve signature spoofing.
23:59:42 <retracey[m]> It didn't work for other apps like youtube and said I didnt have google play service
23:59:49 <retracey[m]> It only helped me use google camera
23:59:51 <retracey[m]> when I had it
