00:12:24 <TheJollyRoger> BobSacmanto[m]: I'm in the process of answering over at the other channel.

00:29:42 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: If you got as far as being able to unlock your bootloader, but fastboot is hanging, this typically indicates that you have a faulty/improperly traced cable that doesn't have all the wires fastboot needs, or your motherboard's USB slots or firmware support for USB is faulty or incomplete.
00:33:04 <damienrg[m]> TheJollyRoger: I tested on 2 different PC and 2 different USB cable (stock Pixel 4a 5g cable and another one)
00:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: Hopefully this isn't the case but one member we had here ended up with two computers that had broken USB slots... so it's not impossible, although it is unlikely, since those cables are probably good.
00:35:10 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: stick around, hopefully we'll find something for you.
00:42:02 <damienrg[m]> TheJollyRoger: I am trying with a different USB driver on windows.
00:51:02 <damienrg[m]> <damienrg[m] "TheJollyRoger: I am trying with "> Same problem: stuck at `Writing vendor...`
00:51:51 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: Yeah, I'm out of ideas at this point, unfortunately.
00:52:19 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: please stick around, we have lots of people who are more experienced than I in this.
00:52:25 <TheJollyRoger> we'll get you running GrapheneOS!
00:53:13 <BobSacmanto[m]> Does GrapheneOS come with a smart button(those buttons in the nav dropdown such as wifi,airplane mode, flashlisht) that toggles mobile data connection on/off
00:54:06 <TheJollyRoger> BobSacmanto[m]: Yes.
00:54:17 <TheJollyRoger> BobSacmanto[m]: pull down the top screen, you should see it there.
00:54:27 <TheJollyRoger> *put your finger on the top of the screen and slowly pull down.
00:54:34 <damienrg[m]> TheJollyRoger: Is it possible to retry only a step of the installation?
00:55:26 <damienrg[m]> TheJollyRoger: in command line install?
00:56:01 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: it is. They're in the script, but I don't recommend running the commands manually. You may want to paste the entire output to a pastebin service, and maybe keep that on hand for someone else to help out.
00:56:13 <TheJollyRoger> g2g
00:57:03 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. I have to step away from the PC.
01:58:27 <hughbee> Hi Jolly, wanted to checkin and et you know that i successfully installed GrapheneOS on my second handset yesterday!!
01:58:32 <hughbee> Thanks again for your assistance!!!!!
02:07:26 <TheJollyRoger> hughbee: Yarr, glad to hear it all worked! Welcome back aboard the ship!
02:20:18 <timetravelingman> Can android have kernel panics
02:20:25 <timetravelingman> If so, what would happen
02:20:38 <timetravelingman> Would the phone explode
02:21:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> timetravelingman: yes android has kernel panics
02:22:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> When a kernel panic happens the system will auto reboot
02:22:19 <timetravelingman> Ah okay, cool
03:29:31 <Fragen> -_-
03:30:31 <Fragen> Any tips on improving security beyond the normal Graphene OS usage? For example, limiting the use of certain apps or features. Perhaps I am thinking too hard and there is no point?
03:40:40 <yeh> Is there a way to uninstall any of the stock apps?
03:42:03 <take_a_deep_brea> no
03:42:12 <take_a_deep_brea> you can disable some of them
03:42:32 <take_a_deep_brea> but its not ususally a recommended thing to do
03:44:30 <yeh> why, what's wrong with disabling an app?
03:47:08 <somenerd[m]> it may break functionality
03:48:59 <take_a_deep_brea> which app in particular do you have in mind when you talk of disabling ?
03:49:22 <yeh> functionality of the rest of the phone outside of the disabled app?
03:49:51 <yeh> valadium the browser
03:50:13 <yeh> I want to uninstall it if possible
03:51:53 <take_a_deep_brea> yeh:  do you mind joining #grapheneos-offtopic as i wish to discuss this further with you and we will end up going off-topic
04:08:48 <RaulDuke> anyone have issue getting notification badges to work on icons?Â  Specifically on Signal, but I'm not seeing it on any icons
04:09:24 <BamBamBigYellow> Hello! Quick question for all y'all. Which filesystem is supported on Graphene when plugging a USB key? I'm trying to get exFat to work and it doesn't recognize my key. Is only Fat the format that's recognized? I can't find that information.
04:13:06 <BamBamBigYellow> Found this reddit thread, that seems to answer my question: https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fv6jgc/grapheneos_and_usb_peripherals_external_usb/
04:13:07 <BamBamBigYellow> Doesn't seem to be supported for the time being!
04:31:16 <Lupita[m]> Correct only FAT is supported for external drives. I had the same issue.
05:04:31 <cjh> Just starting CLI GrapheneOS install on Pixel 4 XL. On prerequisites, instructions state to enable OEM unlocking. When I tap Settings -> About Phone and press and hold on build number, all that happens is an option to copy build number to the clipboard, NOT enable developer mode. Please help.
05:05:14 <TheJollyRoger> cjh: tap it repeatedly, you need to tap it ten times rapidly in quick succession.
05:05:26 <cjh> Thank you.
05:05:29 <TheJollyRoger> cjh: I do not recommend you use the CLI install. Please use the web install at https://grapheneos.org/install/web
05:06:01 <TheJollyRoger> cjh: the web install is a safer and more reliable way for you to do it. Follow the instructions. I have to head off, but if you run into trouble usually someone is here that can help you out.
05:06:36 <cjh> Joy from tapping several times. Thanks again.
05:08:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, bon voyage, future shipmate, and an welcome in advance onboard the ship!
05:37:56 <Delta[m]> Woah. Had no idea that web install was a thing.
05:38:38 <take_a_deep_brea> well , its just awesome . you could install graphene on a pixe; from another decent android device
05:38:48 <Delta[m]> I've neglected the community for a while and only check up on things occasionally
05:38:58 <Delta[m]> That's crazy
05:57:33 <nazgulc[m]> Hey guys,
05:57:33 <nazgulc[m]> I am trying to understand why google maps doesn't work as flawlessly as on regular android than GrapheneOS..
05:57:34 <nazgulc[m]> Can someone explain what is different in GrapheneOS? I don't know the technical difference..Just want to educate myself.
05:58:09 <nazgulc[m]> I guess it has to do something with location backend, reverse geocoding or something...
05:58:37 <nazgulc[m]> Just if someone can explain that would help clear my doubts technically.
06:09:03 <lodtank> i'm not saying anything against your webinstall, it just for me doesn't sound right to flash a phone over a browser;)
06:09:50 <take_a_deep_brea> lodtank:  google set the precedent for this , if you weren't aware , with flash.android.com .
06:10:02 <lodtank> take_a_deep_brea: thx, didn't know that yet
06:10:06 <take_a_deep_brea> besides its supposed to be used on chromium
06:10:06 <sphinxcat[m]> nazgulc: it's explained in the site: https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
06:10:14 <lodtank> i'm not saying you're webinstall is wrong, don't take me wrong:)
06:10:16 <take_a_deep_brea> a higly reliable browser
06:10:22 <take_a_deep_brea> nah , we didnt
06:10:39 <lodtank> i just come from a time where browsers were absolutely not good software:)
06:10:57 <take_a_deep_brea> we are just hoping to make a point in its favor and convince of  its coolness , lol
06:10:58 <lodtank> and well, from a time where browsers were made for browsing. :)
06:12:24 <lodtank> i didn't take a closer look yet, because i think when i flashed my phone, the website still recommended the cli method, which worked fine here
06:12:33 <lodtank> it sounds very userfriendly anyway
06:12:33 <take_a_deep_brea> totally understandable . but its possible to just download the website and run it locally on a chrome/chromium/safari/edge instance

06:12:57 <strcat[m]> @room Copperhead continues spreading misinformation about us, they have a core group of people who are working with them which you can see from the likes/retweets on what I replied to
06:13:19 <strcat[m]> @room be aware that these people are spreading misinformation and trying to project what they do to us onto us, as if we are the ones waging this escalating war

06:14:50 <strcat[m]> @room there is nothing wrong with people having 1 account on a site and posting in support of us along with countering misinformation and we'll continuing to ask our community to support us in countering the false claims made about the project
06:15:51 <nullnode[m]> Who are the sockpuppets James talks about?
06:16:03 <strcat> nullnode[m]: people like you who argue with him on twitter
06:16:16 <nullnode[m]> When I worked with him closely both me and him ran our own little sockpuppet networks
06:16:29 <strcat> there is *nothing* wrong with people having an account on hacker news, reddit, twitter, etc. and helping to fight their misinformation war against us
06:16:33 <nullnode[m]> I remember smoking weed with him while he coded it out of the provided code in the back of a 2600
06:16:49 <strcat> we've asking people to help support us without violating any site rules
06:16:52 <strcat> been asking*
06:17:09 <nullnode[m]> I've opted out of corpo internet, I at least don't hold accoutns anymore. public view only.
06:17:27 <nullnode[m]> it's not possible not to violate site rules
06:17:46 <nullnode[m]> james is an open con/fraud, the canadian courts are just stupid enough not to snag him.
06:18:02 <nullnode[m]> or intendedly stupid
06:18:28 <cjh007> Performing CLI GrapheneOS install. Put Pixel 4 XL in developer mode, and enabled OEM Unlocking. Started phone holding power button and volume down simultaneously. This put phone in fastboot mode. Is that the same as bootloader interface? I ask because even though Windows 10 show Pixel 4 XL connected, adb says no devices found. Thus, fastboot
06:18:28 <cjh007> flashing unlock command simply hangs and have to use Ctrl C to stop. Any help is appreciated.
06:18:41 <nullnode[m]> after knowing him since 2012 IRL, I can say he's as greasy as they come, and I wouldn't be suprised if he was a handled asset of a intellgence agency at this point
06:19:04 <nullnode[m]> so Seth Simmons, self censoring prior posts, shows me more evidence of that
06:19:26 <nullnode[m]> I always saw Monero as a backdoored agency run honeypot, know I know a couple related projects.
06:19:56 <strcat[m]> cjh007: please follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web (recommended) or https://grapheneos.org/install/web including making sure to install the correct driver
06:20:19 <strcat[m]> cjh007: carefully read the sections on booting it to the bootloader interface and connecting the phone
06:20:29 <strcat[m]> cjh007: use the web install if you aren't familiar with CLI
06:23:42 <cjh007> Familiar w/CLI. Think I read pretty carefully. Downloaded fastboot, confirmed install w/hash, and added path (even though I'm in platform-tools directory with nonadministrator powershell and removed curl alias),
06:27:13 <cjh007> Followed instructions on booting phone by holding both power button and down volume. But as I said, the screen says fastboot mode, not bootloader interface. Can toggle between different boot modes with volume buttons, etc. So, seems like bootloader interface, but confirmation would be helpful since adb and fastboot aren't executing on the phone.
06:30:14 <strcat> cjh007: 'fastboot mode' is the bootloader interface
06:30:17 <strcat> please, follow the instructions there
06:30:33 <strcat> cjh007: adb is not used as part of the installation process, you will not be provided with support here if you use unofficial guides
06:30:39 <strcat> cjh007: you need to follow the official guide
06:30:51 <strcat> cjh007: you need to follow the rebooting to bootloader interface and connecting the phone sections
06:30:58 <strcat> cjh007: close whatever unofficial guides / information you're following
06:31:07 <strcat> follow those 2 sections whether it's the web install (recommended) or CLI install
06:31:47 <strcat> cjh007: https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone this section has what you have to do
06:31:52 <strcat> I can't say it better here
06:31:56 <strcat> > On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot now: In Windows Update, click Check for updates. After that there might be a link "View optional updates." Download and install any driver updates. If there are no optional updates, simply continue with the installation instructions.
06:33:59 <cjh007> Thanks. Not following any unofficial guides. Checked Windows Update. No drivers under optional updates.
06:34:30 <cjh007> Again, Windows 10 shows device is attached to USB port.

06:37:54 <joe84747929> Chj007 I just joined and can't see your previous posts but your last one sounds like you're having the same install prob I did.Â  Check through all your windows update settings and turn on the radio button for downloading "related" services or software
06:38:33 <cjh007> Thanks Joe, will do.
06:39:19 <hardbrick> Hello
06:39:51 <hardbrick> Noticed the bramble release.
06:40:11 <hardbrick> Just installed and working well. But noticed something.
06:41:53 <hardbrick> During the auditor check. I encountered a invalid verified boot key fingerprint.
06:41:55 <cjh007> An "Intel - Other Hardware" showed up this time. Doubtful it's related, but will do update. So signing off for now to install and reboot computer. Thanks.
06:43:21 <sphinxcat[m]> hardbrick: make sure Auditor is up-to-date
06:44:29 <cjh007> Is there a sign-out, or does one just close the browser?
06:45:26 <joe84747929> For this channel? Just close
06:45:36 <cjh007> Thanks. Bye.
06:46:15 <hardbrick> I'll check on the 3a
06:46:53 <sphinxcat[m]> hardbrick: Auditor version 24 added support for bramble
06:47:50 <hardbrick> Ahh I see. Version 23 on sunfish. 24 on bramble
06:48:30 <hardbrick> Well besides that its working well.
06:53:44 <joe84747929> Anyone have any idea?Â  Sorry for the duplicate post:
06:53:50 <joe84747929> Looking for some opinions from the graphene zeitgeist...being an extremely secure, minimalist OS, is there any permanent security risk or tracking when installing and then removing aurora store apps?  In other words, does temporarily using apps with trackers compromise the security and/or anonymity even after the app is removed?  Thanks for any
06:53:51 <joe84747929> input you can provide.
07:06:40 <nullnode[m]> I would think using any external app will compromise your security, or at least build up your overall threat risks
07:07:19 <nullnode[m]> f-droid is probably the riskest a smart person would want to go
07:07:36 <nullnode[m]> Google Play apps... you never really know what an app dev has put in it.
07:07:50 <nullnode[m]> or what Google did to it before publishing it
07:16:43 <take_a_deep_brea> joe84747929: what you are saying is highly incosistent , how come a secure minimalist OS be comromised by apps with trackers in them
07:17:34 <take_a_deep_brea> its true i may end up using  a flashlight app which does  something with my data on me giving it permissiom
07:17:35 <somenerd[m]> wdym "tracking"
07:17:41 <somenerd[m]> tracking what you do in the app?
07:17:46 <take_a_deep_brea> but nothing otherwise
07:17:54 <sphinxcat[m]> they left / timed out
07:17:55 <somenerd[m]> it can only get what you give permissions to
07:18:09 <take_a_deep_brea> sphinxcat: thanks for that
07:20:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw we need people who can help us against misinformation. Please PM me
07:20:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> I am a developer and I might be busy with fixing something so I might not be able to reply right away. Please be patient after you pm me
07:20:50 <nullnode[m]> I think he makes an interesting question, when an app is uninstalled, can the app perform any last duties during the uninstall? like send a network ping?
07:21:48 <somenerd[m]> I mean, they probably have to gain some sort of privilege in order to really do any damage
07:22:04 <somenerd[m]> have to be malicious instead of not privacy respecting
07:23:41 <nullnode[m]> well even a network ping that states, time and date of uninstall along with any sort of fingerprint might be a major compromise at the least.
07:24:17 <nullnode[m]> but having DNS/IP firewall policies passive enough to allow random traffic outbound is a much wider hole to worry about
07:24:24 <somenerd[m]> I mean, if it was permissionless, it could only do so much
07:24:32 <somenerd[m]> offtopic though
07:24:41 <nullnode[m]> it was a question
07:25:45 <somenerd[m]> maybe get the list of packages and send that as a fingerprint?
07:35:50 <sunfish[m]> Is it a bug or a feature?
07:35:50 <sunfish[m]> Hi all, just a question. Using the email client K9 (wonderful tool) I'm facing the problem that it's not possible to save an attachment on my Pixel 4a running the latest GrapheneOS. If I choose to save it I can see a file with the correct name, however, the size is just 0 Byte. And more confusing is that it is possible to view it with the original PDF app.
07:35:50 <sunfish[m]> Next question: is it intended that one can not save the document viewed with the PDF app from GrapheneOS?
07:36:36 <strcat[m]> @room important threat: https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1362658541023158272 and sorry for pinging you, but this is really important and I'm just exhausted dealing with this daily
07:36:50 <strcat[m]>  * @room important thread: https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1362658541023158272 and sorry for pinging you, but this is really important and I'm just exhausted dealing with this daily
07:37:10 <thelonelyone> Hi everyone! Not sure if this is the right place to seek help. If not, please let me know.
07:37:10 <thelonelyone> I've been using GrapheneOS for quite a few months and I'm loving it. Everything has always worked exactly the way I need it to. But within the past few days, I've had trouble with charging my phone. Can't tell if it's a software or hardware issue.
07:37:11 <thelonelyone> From what I can tell, the phone itself is charging. However, once it's charging, the number reported by the phone at the battery percentage doesn't move and acts like it isn't being charged (the charge appears stationary, no matter which charging cable I use or socket). At first I thought it was a problem with my charger, but I soon learnt is was
07:37:11 <thelonelyone> with my actual phone. If I then restart my phone, it boots up again and it reports the percentage at 50% with unknown time until the battery dies. It will then remain at 50%.
07:37:12 <thelonelyone> Has anyone else experienced this problem before? Any ideas on how I can fix it? Thanks all.
07:37:33 <cjh007> It was Windows 10 driver issue. GrapheneOS up and running on Pixel 4 XL. Thanks strcat & Joe.
07:40:11 <cjh007> Is Google Play the best place for apps?
07:43:50 <Urija[m]> You can try FDroid. I'm not even sure if Google Play Store works on Graphene, since it doesnt have Play services.
07:44:26 <sphinxcat[m]> People use Play Store via Aurora Store.
07:44:31 <lasseter[m]> Many folks use Aurora Store for google play
07:48:13 <cjh007> Thank you. I'll look into FDroid and Aurora Store. Any thoughts on apps for email, messaging, (gonna use Signal for phone & messages), syncing contacts with icloud, maps, etc.?
07:55:32 <danielk[m]> Aurastore works great! Especially if u have to use your banking apps ;) most of them do not need google play service in background
07:55:43 <TuxKruger> Did someone ping me?
07:56:05 <ruski[m]> k9 for email. magic earth for maps
07:56:29 <TuxKruger> OsmAnd~ is good for maps as well
07:57:03 <take_a_deep_brea> TuxKruger:  the whole room was pinged
07:57:13 <TuxKruger> Oh
07:57:40 <take_a_deep_brea> its about copperhead , you know , just scroll up
07:58:00 <TuxKruger> Meh, nvm I don't like Copperhead anyway
07:59:11 <take_a_deep_brea> anyways  it was about how they did their latest thing on twitter , it was from strcat
07:59:59 <cjh007> Just looked at some email apps. K9 was rated highly, so too with Spark Mail. Anyone tried Spark Mail (looks good to me because of universal inbox. I segregate topics by different emails, so integration is helpful). Will also check out Magic Earth and OsmAnd for maps.
08:01:07 <TuxKruger> FairMail is also good for email
08:01:10 <TuxKruger> Tho I personally use K-9
08:03:54 <cjh007> Does K-9 have universal inbox? Any good syncing software for contacts with iCloud?
08:04:42 <cjh007> Syncing both ways, and just updates, not rewriting entire database occasionally...
08:11:38 <Jens[m]> <TuxKruger "BTW I have a weird question. How"> Yes, according to whatsapp this should work: https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-restore-your-chat-history/?lang=en
08:12:26 <Jens[m]> > <@tux-kruger:matrix.org> BTW I have a weird question. How can you backup whatsapp messages without Google Drive? (Don't kill me, my school's group made by teachers is on WhatsApp, so I can't really stop using it anytime soon) I also want to degoogle my life but small things like this are interfering a lot
08:12:26 <Jens[m]>  * Yes, according to whatsapp this should work: https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-restore-your-chat-history/?lang=en
08:12:26 <Jens[m]> i pulled the backup when switching to graphene but never bothered to restore, as i do not plan to install it at all :)
08:22:50 <Urija[m]> TuxKruger: You can also consider installing Whatsapp in a seperate user profile. Whenever you end the session of that profile, Whatsapp can't track you anymore until you return to that profile to use it. (Keep in mind you also recieve messages only when that user profile is active).
08:43:50 <mdtkje> hi newbee here. Â I want to buy a pixel 5 for grapheneos is that ok?
08:47:42 <mdtkje> Ok I find it

12:02:01 <strcat[m]> damienrg: use the cable that ships with the phone
12:02:11 <strcat[m]> or a high quality one from a trustworthy brand
12:02:22 <strcat[m]> you're probably using a broken non-spec-compliant USB-A to C cable
12:02:25 <strcat[m]> 50% are broken

12:25:07 <Jens[m]>  * I got exactly the same when trying to install on my Linux desktop. Swapping cables and ports changed "how far" the installer got.
12:25:07 <Jens[m]> Using the USB C cable supplied with the pixel 4a on the Windows computer of my wife (mine does not have usbc) it worked perfectly fine on the first try.
12:25:07 <Jens[m]> so most likely usb cable or port
12:36:21 <zvl12[m]> Auditor is only necessary at GOS installation, or it can be used on regular basis to check if nothing was compromised ?
12:36:59 <strcat> zvl12[m]: it's never *necessary*, it's always useful
12:37:09 <strcat> zvl12[m]: it's more useful after the initial pairing
12:37:15 <strcat> zvl12[m]: https://attestation.app/about
12:37:35 <strcat> you can set up the https://attestation.app/ service for automatic scheduled remote verification
12:37:57 <strcat> and it can send alert emails if the device fails to give a valid attestation for a given time period
12:39:41 <zvl12[m]> <strcat "and it can send alert emails if "> what time interval for scheduled tasks do you recommend ?
12:45:09 <somenerd[m]> it's your choice
12:45:19 <strcat> zvl12[m]: default is fine
12:45:24 <somenerd[m]> I mean, depends on how often you want attestation to occur
12:49:01 <zvl12[m]> <strcat "zvl12: default is fine"> every 4 hours ?
12:51:34 <strcat> zvl12[m]: yeah default is fine
12:51:45 <strcat> zvl12[m]: you can set it as low as 1 hour if you're fine with it waking hourly to do it
12:52:05 <strcat> it won't bypass Doze, etc. though, if the device is in deep idle it won't interrupt that (except always at least once a day)

15:47:49 <strcat[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: the cool thing is that Pixel 4 and newer will be using LLVM toolchain for the kernel for everything but the assembler
15:47:49 <timeo[m]> this is the one thing i hate about privacy the abuse of people
15:48:06 <timeo[m]> and making so many fakes accounts
15:48:10 <strcat[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: Pixel 3 / 3a doesn't use ld.lld for the target linker atm but maybe we could get it to work
15:48:13 <strcat[m]> doesn't really matter
15:48:48 <strcat[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_redbull/blob/11/build.sh
15:49:05 <timeo[m]> but anyway, i had question about backu
15:49:12 <strcat[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: so the remnant of the GNU toolchain is basically just the assembler, and only for the kernel
15:49:14 <timeo[m]>  * but anyway, i had question about back up
15:49:40 <strcat[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: which is quite nice since LLVM toolchain targets anything LLVM supports
15:49:50 <strcat[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: GNU toolchain needs separate cross-compilation toolchains for each target
15:49:54 <strcat[m]> separate build of each tool etc
15:49:58 <timeo[m]> how  does it work with restoring a backup?
15:50:05 <strcat[m]> so you have 1 version per type of target platform
15:50:42 <strcat[m]> it's ridiculously painful to deal with and the limitations of it hold back supporting a new platform like say, RISC-V
15:51:12 <strcat[m]> hopefully over the next couple years LLVM assembler for the Linux kernel starts being viable
15:51:19 <strcat[m]> rather than a messed up experimental option
15:53:17 <timeo[m]> like restoring messages, calling history
15:53:47 <strcat[m]> timeo: Seedvault for app data, contacts, etc. and manual backup of your profile's home directory
15:53:56 <strcat[m]> unfortunately Seedvault doesn't have user profile support yet
15:54:14 <strcat[m]> timeo: some apps have manual data export/import too
15:54:28 <strcat[m]> for Signal you need to use Signal's encrypted backup / restore
15:54:38 <strcat[m]> because the way they store data is incompatible with an external form of backups
15:54:39 <timeo[m]> i know, but i was more looking for restoring calling history
15:55:06 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <timeo[m] "i know, but i was more looking f"> Seedvault supports that iirc

17:34:25 <penpal[m]> Hey guys! Just got my pixel and wanted ask in the event I need to switch back to stock pixel os after flashing graphene, is it difficult?
17:35:01 <shibboleth> no, fastboot unlock, flash stock?
17:35:06 <alex-resist> penpal: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
17:35:32 <shibboleth> fastboot unlock will wipe /data, but you're looking to factory reset it anyway
17:36:05 <shibboleth> does grapheneos offer partition backup/restore in a twrp-ish manner?
17:36:09 <shibboleth> in recovery
17:36:37 <strcat> shibboleth: no we have Seedvault for backups
17:36:44 <penpal[m]> <alex-resist "penpal: https://grapheneos.org/i"> Awesome thanks!
17:36:50 <strcat> which is a secure encrypted backup feature using the OS backup infrastructure
17:36:54 <strcat> it has a lot of room for improvement
17:38:10 <strcat> atm main limitations are it doesn't back up the profile's home directory for you, doesn't support secondary user profiles yet and doesn't mark itself as a device-to-device backup to bypass allowBackup="false" for modern apps where that has changed meaning to disabling remote backups (apps can still blacklist files not meant to be backed up such as a cache, device-specific data, etc.)
17:38:11 <shibboleth> lemme guess, this only covers stuff in /data and is more of an.. "export/import" than backup/restore?
17:38:18 <strcat> it's backup/restore
17:38:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> ride: hello, we don't have a lot of users who use that
17:38:25 <strcat> I Don't know what you mean by only covers stuff in /data
17:38:31 <strcat> what else would you back up? all your data is in /data
17:38:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can try to set it up on a raspberry Pi or something
17:38:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> And get back to you
17:38:45 <strcat> the OS images are verified and bit-for-bit identical across every install, same as firmware
17:38:53 <shibboleth> does it tar the filesystem of a partition, like twrp?
17:38:56 <strcat> no
17:39:05 <strcat> it backs up app and OS data as I said
17:39:11 <shibboleth> or is it some convoluted "export data, store differently", like "windows backup"
17:39:13 <strcat> you have to backup your profile's home directory manually for now
17:39:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> ride: please file an issue on our issue tracker
17:39:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Provide relevant logs, screenshots, steps to reproduce, wifi AP configuration, grapheneos version, device name

17:39:59 <penpal[m]> Oh also sorry to pop in again but is it ok to ask a question about an appâs compatibility from aurora in this room? Or should I ask offtopic?
17:40:01 <strcat> shibboleth: it backs up the data in the form that it's stored by the apps and OS for the most part, other than certain cases where data is stored in a non-portable way and there's an explicit implementation of a portable format
17:40:07 <strcat> shibboleth: it's portable between devices / installs
17:40:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Give us as much information as possible so we can help you out
17:40:16 <ride[m]> I will do that later today. Thanks!
17:40:20 <shibboleth> ok, can it back up /persist?
17:40:23 <strcat> shibboleth: as I said above, at the moment, it doesn't yet mark itself as a local backup feature
17:40:36 <strcat> shibboleth: there is no user data in there, it's not accessible to the OS either
17:41:28 <strcat> shibboleth: I think you may be confused about how the partition setup works on the supported devices
17:41:53 <shibboleth> really?
17:42:14 <shibboleth> is there *any* conceivable way of me being able to use grapheneos and be able to edit some files in /persist once in a while?
17:42:21 <strcat> no
17:42:26 <shibboleth> bummer
17:42:31 <strcat> what stuff in persist would you edit?
17:42:55 <shibboleth> can grapheneos co-exist with twrp if twrp is flashed before re-locking the bootloader?
17:44:31 <strcat[m]> no
17:44:32 <strcat[m]> you can't use a custom recovery with GrapheneOS
17:44:40 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: it wouldn't boot, there's verified boot
17:44:45 <shibboleth> right
17:45:11 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: even if it could GrapheneOS updates will replace all the OS + firmware partitions with the latest ones (the updates would fail to apply with delta updates, you'd miss updates until there was no delta available)
17:45:25 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: updates ship all the OS / firmware images
17:45:41 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: there's no recovery partition nowadays anyway
17:45:43 <shibboleth> yeah, i was afraid the otas/sideloading them would be messing with recovery
17:45:46 <shibboleth> oh
17:45:59 <strcat[m]> recovery is part of boot image
17:46:25 <strcat[m]> and there's a userspace fastboot mode (fastbootd) that's basically a mode of recovery
17:46:43 <strcat[m]> the bootloader fastboot mode only handles low-level OS partitions now
17:47:04 <strcat[m]> and then fastboot boots up the userspace fastbootd mode after flashing those to flash the higher-level images
17:47:13 <strcat[m]> makes the bootloader much simpler + decoupled from format of the higher level images
17:47:17 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have to know how that works
17:51:06 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: and btw for an app like Signal it uses hardware keystore to encrypt the database so you have to back up via Signal itself
17:51:10 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: an app doing that kind of thing *could* implement a local-only backup service override (i.e. override the default of backing up all the app files directory) and it'd work with Seedvault
17:51:41 <strcat[m]> they choose not to though
17:51:43 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: also seedvault doesn't mark itself as a local backup service yet, I think it likely will soon
17:51:46 <strcat[m]> local backup service -> allowBackup="false" is ignored for API 30+ apps
17:52:21 <strcat[m]> the meaning of allowBackup="false" changes to disallowing remote backups
17:52:26 <strcat[m]> for API 30+
17:52:34 <strcat[m]> so, that's available already, but Seedvault doesn't take advantage yet
17:52:36 <strcat[m]> there's an open issue
17:59:05 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: in near future tho Seedvault should be ignoring allowBackup="false" for modern apps
17:59:28 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: (just keep in mind they can still blacklist files, which they only do for caches, session tokens, device-specific stuff, etc.)
18:00:21 <shibboleth> i don't really bother with "appdata", i want "partition" backups/a time machine
18:01:00 <strcat[m]> that's what it backs up: the OS and app data
18:01:19 <strcat[m]> the partition is useless to you, you wouldn't be able to decrypt it anywhere else
18:01:20 <shibboleth> graphene looks great, except i need access to /persist
18:01:36 <strcat[m]> you couldn't decrypt the userdata partition even on the same device after a factory reset
18:02:06 <strcat[m]> the ability to do that is gone without the HSM and TEE stored portions of what's needed to derive the keys
18:02:23 <strcat[m]> those are wiped on factory reset / lock / unlock
18:02:40 <strcat[m]> shibboleth: I don't understand what you need in /persist
18:02:58 <shibboleth> to be able to to manipulate the bluetooth mac for one thing
18:05:29 <shibboleth> i get that there's wifi mac randomization, but i want to make sure that neither the factory wifi or bluetooth mac are broadcast even once
18:05:50 <shibboleth> the only way to do that is to change them in /persist before flashing graphene
18:06:34 <shibboleth> also, to be able to discard/change them on demand
18:08:08 <timetravelingman> You can't, sorry.
18:08:17 <shibboleth> yeah, got that
18:08:27 <timetravelingman> :D
18:08:44 <paranoidroid> Hi everyone, I'm looking into getting a new GrapheneOS phone, which would be the way to go? I read in the recommended devicesÂ  https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices there's mentions up to Pixel 4 and no mention of the Pixel, 5 but I saw in the releases there's a stable Pixel 5 version?
18:12:16 <timetravelingman> You can use Pixel 5
18:14:17 <paranoidroid> Ok thanks, are there any drawbacks I should be aware of? any reason why 5 is not listed in recommended devices?
18:27:30 <strcat> paranoidroid: it is
18:27:54 <strcat[m]> paranoidroid: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
18:28:01 <strcat[m]> just haven't removed Pixel 4 and 4 XL yet
18:29:06 <strcat[m]> I'll update the previous section
18:30:00 <Knull[m]> 4xl not recommended anymore? that's mine.. ð
18:31:37 <strcat[m]> just won't be recommended to purchase as a new device for GrapheneOS
18:31:41 <strcat[m]> nothing wrong with 4 and 4 XL
18:31:57 <strcat[m]> they just won't be supported as long as 4a or particularly the 4a (5G) and 5
18:32:26 <strcat[m]> there's little reason to upgrade from 4 to 5 for strictly security reasons
18:32:39 <strcat[m]> does have a much bigger battery though
18:36:51 <purple69> Hi
18:37:52 <purple69> I just saw the website on graphene, and as I am about to get another cell phone,Â  very interested
18:37:53 <strcat[m]> paranoidroid: updated https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices you need to force refresh to see it probably
18:39:36 <purple69> I do one or two things which are not very privacy, security.Â Â  I use Prime Video.Â Â  I would guess there might be a container to run something like this. I thought I would ask before spending hours reading and still being unsure.Â Â  a bunch of money to put out
18:40:00 <paranoidroid> Thanks strcat[m] !
18:41:40 <strcat[m]> paranoidroid: so, basically, 4a is a good choice for a budget device, 4a (5G) and 5 are more expensive but have nicer hardware and will be supported a bit longer
18:41:48 <strcat[m]> 4a is the oldest device you should buy
18:42:00 <strcat[m]> was $349 at launch
18:42:09 <strcat[m]> 4a (5G) is closer to 5 than 4a
18:42:23 <penpal[m]> <strcat[m] "paranoidroid: so, basically, 4a "> also the 4a 5g is discounted to almost the exact same price as the 4a on google's site
18:42:28 <strcat[m]> 5 is like a 4a (5G) with nicer screen / slightly bigger battery basically, and some fancier stuff
18:43:08 <strcat[m]> 4a (5G) doesn't have wireless charging or the same dust / waterproofing

18:44:31 <strcat[m]> it won't implement any Google services
18:44:56 <strcat[m]> the purpose of it will be to make apps work that only work when Play services is present but do not actually have a hard requirement to use Google services
18:45:12 <strcat[m]> i.e. if the app can work with all the Google servers down, etc. it would work with that stub app
18:45:52 <purple69> amazon puts out a prime video app.Â  not sure if you are saying I do not need google play store to run it..
18:46:20 <strcat[m]> this isn't a feature yet
18:46:22 <strcat[m]> it's a planned feature
18:46:33 <strcat[m]> (disabled by default)
18:47:15 <purple69> I would have thought it was a I could use some apps inside a container.
18:47:30 <purple69> strcat are you speaking to me
18:47:57 <strcat[m]> the stuff about Play services wasn't in reply to you but the last 3 lines were
18:51:01 <purple69> well, I can not afford at home internet.Â  and prime video takes up a for what entertainment I can get,Â  I am 71 and rona hiding.Â Â  I guess this puts graphene out of the picture for me now

18:56:25 <purple69> what apps usually work on graphene.Â Â  I am not complaining, I think it a good idea to block a lot of things that are convenient and fun to use
18:57:12 <nscnt[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't block any apps.
18:57:20 <take_a_deep_brea> well any app that works on android OS without having any dependency on the existence of play services should work

19:09:01 <strcat[m]> Preload: it's a specific signature from a first party OS key that's treated as the Google Play services key, there will absolutely not be any generic signature spoofing since it breaks the OS security model
19:09:20 <purple69> thanks for the information.Â  I have hope
19:09:36 <strcat[m]> Preload: we also won't be reimplementing Play services just stubbing out the APIs
19:09:52 <strcat[m]> so we're not going to have a significantly less secure implementation of Play services, as others are doing
19:10:10 <strcat[m]> it won't have network access, etc. it's not going to be doing anything other than returning errors
19:10:46 <strcat[m]> what microG does is reimplementing a small subset of Play services in a hacky way, and with less security, because they don't implement the same pinning and security checks
19:11:01 <strcat[m]> so, some apps can work if it covers what they use
19:11:03 <strcat[m]> others won't
19:11:22 <strcat[m]> and the apps that work can stop working at any time, if they start using more of the APIs, or microG's implementation stops working with Google's servers
19:11:26 <strcat[m]> it cannot be relied upon
19:11:35 <strcat[m]> it also has to have major porting to each new major OS release which takes a long time
19:11:51 <strcat[m]> for multiple reasons, it doesn't fit into what GrapheneOS wants to accomplish
19:12:04 <strcat[m]> we looked at it and there are serious security and maintainability issues with the approach
19:12:20 <r0tt0r[m]> <warmjuice[m] "clear cache and data"> thx, 3.2.9 didnt work,v4 beta works again
19:12:40 <strcat[m]> so, we're taking an approach that does not add any substantial attack surface, is far easier to maintain and can realistically be 'complete'
19:12:44 <strcat[m]> not 10% done and chasing a moving target
19:12:51 <strcat[m]> to just stay 10% done
19:13:12 <strcat[m]> we will not be providing an implementation of any Google services, that's not what it is about
19:13:38 <strcat[m]> the point is getting apps working which unnecessarily require Play services to be present but do not actually need to use Google services and rather just weren't written to handle Play services not being around
19:14:38 <strcat[m]> basically, pretend that Google services are down, or unavailable (China), that is what our app is going to mimic and pretend is happening
19:14:41 <r0tt0r[m]> <purple69 "thanks for the information.Â  I h"> so amazon prime installed and starting, i could login though have no account yet. might take some time to gather one

20:02:45 <mynacol[m]> ride: Regarding the WPA-Enterprise network: I use one, but with TTLS and PAP. But also for me I had to enter a domain and an anonymous identity. The domain is for certificate checking, so not entering it will allow man-in-the-middle attacks. So please do enter the right domain. You should get the data from your IT department. Alternatively, there may be an app available, which helps connecting. For eduroam there is
20:02:45 <mynacol[m]> `eduroamCAT`.
20:02:45 <mynacol[m]> If you really want to, you should be able to change CA-Certificate to "not validate" or sth. in this direction.
20:07:39 <mynacol[m]> ride: I repeat the dangers by citing from Wikipedia: A CA certificate must be used at each client to authenticate the server to each client before the client submits authentication credentials. If the CA certificate is not validated, in general it is trivial to introduce a fake Wireless Access Point which then allows gathering of MS-CHAPv2 handshakes. (

21:08:17 <mynacol[m]> Nontheless, I guess the problem is a bad usb cable or port

21:54:36 <poisonoushydra> I wonder what their end goal is considering how erratic their behaviour seems to be.
22:00:36 <skwisgaar[m]> poisonoushydra: cause as much damage and suffering as possible, because if they canât have nice things then this project shouldnât (in their minds) be allowed to either.
22:14:33 <r0tt0r[m]> <poisonoushydra "I wonder what their end goal is "> someone today brought it up, open their website and see the marketing, open gos and see a lot of technical explanations and wisdom. that says it in short words. money is the target imho

22:25:30 <zvl12[m]> <zvl12[m] "Pixel 4a5G  all settings good bu"> see here settings - i dont see any reason why it doesnt ring (same problem on 4a and 4a5G)
23:11:17 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "to what you hear from him now, w"> "Graphene stole our changes!" Dude, your os is proprietary and every feature that you make comes several months after grapheneos implements the same thing
23:11:32 <grapheneos_user_> How do people fall for this BS?
23:14:58 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <grapheneos_user_ "How do people fall for this BS?"> Some people believe in flat earth
23:15:11 <grapheneos_user_> <DFuchsiaOS_when "Some people believe in flat eart"> Very true

23:39:43 <warmjuice[m]> Every time I went go Jamesâs Twitter, my mind reads his tweets with the voice of Lew from Unbox Therapy
23:42:24 <strcat[m]> Preload: I don't see anything professional and collected about his behavior particularly his recent deranged series of tweets everywhere including trying to get https://twitter.com/iangcarroll fired for sending a message with s middle finger emoji
23:42:52 <strcat[m]> the stuff he says and does is actually pretty deranged
23:45:13 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/_copperj/status/1356303734691819524
23:45:15 <strcat[m]> look at this
23:45:19 <strcat[m]> and tell me that's not deranged
23:45:35 <strcat[m]> > Hi @jack. Fellow CEO here.
23:45:44 <strcat[m]> > I'm sure you can understand the struggles of being a tech CEO
23:46:16 <strcat[m]> it's not normal to sweet talk people like this, it's disturbing that he does this all the time
23:46:30 <strcat[m]> calling every woman he meets "dear" including a waitress
23:46:46 <strcat[m]> that's how he is all the time
23:46:59 <strcat[m]> and yeah I guess some people want to be sweet talked by someone very openly trying to manipulate them
23:49:14 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/_copperj/status/1358252959096840195 he tries to use the terms people use in reference to give abusive behavior in ways that don't even make any sense
23:49:43 <ismellcap45[m]> CopperheadOS
23:49:44 <ismellcap45[m]> SUCKS
23:50:09 <ismellcap45[m]> Well their community sucks
23:50:22 <ismellcap45[m]> Some of their community
23:51:04 <strcat[m]> I think I come across as someone that has had enough of this person with narcissistic personality disorder obsessively trying to harm me for years and to destroy the project that I spend most of my time on
23:55:29 <ismellcap45[m]> <strcat[m] "I think I come across as someone"> Just file a police report or something
23:56:10 <strcat> don't see what that would accomplish
23:56:56 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <ismellcap45[m] "Just file a police report or som"> There's already a counterclaim lawsuit filed btw
23:57:06 <DFuchsiaOS_when> If I phrased that correctly
23:57:56 <jeff[m]5> I'd tentatively assume closed source forks of open source security projects exist at east in part to support some back door anyways, but..  There multiple examples of hacker types who "went a bit (more) unhinged" after what is likely to be the FBI forcing them to become a CI, or in this case forcing them to install back doors.  It's narcissistic behavior of course, but as users we should take his behavior as further
23:57:56 <jeff[m]5> evidence that copperhead is likely to contain backdoors.  It's not like there is any shortage of backdoored security products, Crypto AG, Juniper, etc
23:58:41 <ismellcap45[m]> So the harassment will stop once he dies

23:58:59 <ismellcap45[m]> Sad
23:59:20 <louipc> as far as i know copper works/has worked with police
23:59:37 <louipc> but don't quote me on that. only hearsay
