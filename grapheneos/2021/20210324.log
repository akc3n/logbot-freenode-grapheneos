00:19:36 <AnonymISP> Hi
00:20:52 <johndoe454[m]> Hi
00:21:38 <AnonymISP> You guys saw how Mullvad partnered with firefox
00:21:42 <AnonymISP> Mullvad vpn
00:21:58 <AnonymISP> It makes me think either Mullvad is a good privacy VPN, geniunily benefiting the users
00:22:06 <AnonymISP> or Mullvad is a data-mining FED Vpn
00:22:15 <johndoe454[m]> Lmao
00:22:19 <AnonymISP> It could be either way
00:22:22 <johndoe454[m]> Firefox is glowie non sense
00:22:25 <AnonymISP> i know
00:22:30 <johndoe454[m]> Anything partnering with it is ass
00:22:35 <AnonymISP> thats why Im suspiscious about mullvad now
00:22:44 <johndoe454[m]> Use an open sourse vpn
00:22:47 <AnonymISP> Such as
00:22:48 <johndoe454[m]> That's stored on ram
00:23:03 <AnonymISP> AirVPN, IVPN, and Cryptostorm are all top rate imo
00:23:08 <AnonymISP> thats my top shelf vpn reccomendation
00:23:15 <AnonymISP> But this community deserves to have privacy.
00:23:26 <johndoe454[m]> Everything deserves privacy
00:23:45 <AnonymISP> i wish i had $1 mill, Id double to size of the tor network
00:24:06 <johndoe454[m]> Tor is alright
00:24:15 <AnonymISP> its open source
00:24:20 <AnonymISP> so i dont think it has a backdoor
00:24:21 <johndoe454[m]> Too many people use it and don't know how it works
00:24:23 <KONCRETE[m]> Are y'all referring to Orbot?
00:24:28 <AnonymISP> Tor in general
00:24:29 <johndoe454[m]> I've coded a bit for tor
00:24:36 <AnonymISP> I think thats good, the more tor users, the more anonymity
00:24:37 <johndoe454[m]> But nothing crazy
00:24:50 <KONCRETE[m]> What about Riseup VPN?
00:24:58 <johndoe454[m]> Rise up is good
00:24:59 <johndoe454[m]> But
00:25:04 <AnonymISP> i think tor is possibly a really secure system, with some vulnerabilities that only the gov knows about
00:25:09 <AnonymISP> i think riseup may be a fed honeypot
00:25:11 <KONCRETE[m]> It gets better speeds than Orbot usually does
00:25:11 <akc3n[m]> There is  #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org and/or #grapheneos-offtopic for irc.
00:25:12 <akc3n[m]> https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
00:25:12 <johndoe454[m]> I don't belive it supports torrenting
00:25:25 <johndoe454[m]> Nah
00:25:28 <sphinx[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org / #grapheneos-offtopic
00:25:30 <johndoe454[m]> Riseup is open sourse
00:25:34 <johndoe454[m]> Even if
00:25:37 <AnonymISP> I asked riseup 'Are you a fed honeypot' and they said 'the only answer here is no'
00:25:49 <johndoe454[m]> Its stored on ram right?
00:25:49 <KONCRETE[m]> Orbot is unusable with its speeds
00:26:15 <johndoe454[m]> If its stored on ram then there's nothing that can be done about it
00:26:38 <AnonymISP> they can MITM and patch downloads and https with malware
00:26:44 <AnonymISP> https traffic
00:26:50 <AnonymISP> i want to trust riseup
00:26:54 <AnonymISP> but im suspiscious of it
00:27:12 <AnonymISP> i trust tor only because its fully open source and involves multiple parties
00:27:21 <AnonymISP> which is the entire anonymity priciple of tor
00:27:37 <AnonymISP> but there could be vulnerabilities in the random number generators etc
00:27:38 <KONCRETE[m]> The speeds AnonymISP..
00:27:44 <AnonymISP> i use a tor router actually
00:27:55 <AnonymISP> its actually quite fast
00:28:11 <elemental> Hi, I have a question about backup. What's the best way to transfer contacts and data from an iphone when setting up Graphene?
00:28:14 <KONCRETE[m]> The KiloBytesss
00:28:53 <AnonymISP> write down the names and phone numbers onto paper
00:30:58 <johndoe454[m]> Yeah
00:31:07 <johndoe454[m]> Having as much shit on paper you can
00:31:11 <johndoe454[m]> Is optimal
00:31:13 <AnonymISP> yes
00:31:15 <pkgbuild[m]> Maybe off topic?
00:31:41 <johndoe454[m]> You can swap phone OS on iPhone anyway
00:31:46 <johndoe454[m]> Can't*
00:32:51 <johndoe454[m]> Iphones are a bunch of proprietary garbage anyway
00:33:57 <johndoe454[m]> I'd like for a good Linux phone to be released
00:34:02 <johndoe454[m]> Ipsum 5 is garbage
00:34:10 <johndoe454[m]> So is pine phone
00:34:55 <AnonymISP> Purism phone soon?
00:34:57 <AnonymISP> AweSIM
00:34:59 <AnonymISP> =)??
00:35:11 <AnonymISP> FreePhone
00:35:13 <akc3n[m]> <elemental "Hi, I have a question about back"> Export contacts from icloud.com, save them to desktop, then transfer them to gos phone via usb, nexr open contacts, settings, import.
00:37:17 <elemental> Thanks!
00:38:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hello elemental, the good news is, if you can export contacts from iCloud, the GrapheneOS contact app will accept .vcf formatted files.
00:38:48 <elemental> Awesome, that's what I was hoping for. Thanks!
00:39:01 <TheJollyRoger> The .vcf (Virtual Card File) format can be edited in a text editor, if worst comes to absolute worst.
00:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome!
00:41:30 <johndoe454[m]> Why do you need to explain basic shit
00:41:38 <johndoe454[m]> Like whatba vcf file is
00:41:45 <johndoe454[m]> * Like what avcf file is
00:41:51 <johndoe454[m]> * Like what a vcf file is
00:41:56 <AnonymISP> google it
00:42:01 <AnonymISP> duckduckgo search it
00:42:06 <johndoe454[m]> There we go
00:42:20 <johndoe454[m]> I was gonna give you the inb4 google
01:07:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Fiery has joined the Telegram Group!
01:39:58 <rawtaz> i dont suppose there's a way to get the default Contacts app to display both name and title/company for each contact? i realize this might be a generic android question and not so much about graphene..
01:41:45 <timetravelingman> Not on the AOSP contacts app
01:42:59 <rawtaz> figured :)
01:44:06 <timetravelingman> <johndoe454[m] "Too many people use it and don't"> You don't need to, and shouldn't, know how Tor works to use Tor. The whole point is it is very accessible for staying anonymous
02:06:36 * rawtaz just chipped in with a small donation, and encourages everyone else to do the same to show their appreciation for this hard work that GrapheneOS is
02:08:02 <rawtaz> here: https://grapheneos.org/donate
02:10:42 <TheJollyRoger> rawtaz: Thank you so much, we really appreciate the donation, it keeps this ship sailing.
02:12:49 <rawtaz> youre welcome, it was genuinely in support, nothing to thank for. i installed graphene this evening and it just worked. it's still android so there's a lot to be said about usability, but that has nothing to with graphene. i think it's very impressive, this software. i wouldnt even know where to begin creating something like this :o
02:13:22 <rawtaz> and again the docs for installing cant be better
02:15:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, an operating system is a pretty complex beast!

12:07:55 <palmetto_moon[m]> So Graphene does a good job of sandboxing apps to prevent them from accessing other parts of the phone right? That plus if I use a VPN that blocks trackers, could I download apps with trackers like google firebase analytics and essentially subvert the trackers?
12:13:33 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed
12:13:41 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading the information on our site
12:14:11 <strcat[m]> palmetto_moon: you've been mislead by misleading / wrong information, so you're starting from a bad place
12:15:23 <jdodjrj[m]> <strcat[m] "I recommend reading the informat"> Please share a link
12:15:28 <jdodjrj[m]> About sandbozing
12:15:58 <strcat[m]> I recommend starting from the information available on our site
12:16:03 <strcat[m]> and if you want there's also the AOSP documentation
12:18:02 <palmetto_moon[m]> So I read the site info along with a very long reddit post from whoever manages that account but I'm asking the question to try and understand it better. So if I were to download TikTok for example how well could they still track me on Graphene?
12:18:28 <somenerd[m]> also just because there isn't any "trackers" listed on a tracker scanner, doesn't mean there aren't any trackers
12:18:30 <strcat[m]> palmetto_moon: it's really not clear what you mean by "track"
12:18:46 <strcat[m]> palmetto_moon: apps are sandboxed, you're in control of what permissions, data and other access the apps are given
12:19:02 <strcat[m]> palmetto_moon: you'll need to ask a much clearer question where it can be understood what you mean
12:19:27 <strcat[m]> palmetto_moon: and I'm not sure why you would be concerned about which third party libraries TikTok uses rather than the app as a whole
12:19:49 <strcat[m]> palmetto_moon: you've been misled by inaccurate information from people that aren't technical / knowledgeable about these topics
12:19:55 <strcat[m]> so as I said earlier, you're starting from a bad place
12:20:03 <strcat[m]> and you need to throw away these misconceptions and learn how stuff really works
12:20:41 <palmetto_moon[m]> Well I don't ever plan on using TikTok I was just trying to think of a good example of an app that tracks what you do and makes a profile, etc
12:21:01 <strcat[m]> the app has access to the permissions you explicitly choose to grant it
12:21:06 <strcat[m]> data you explicitly enter into it
12:21:11 <strcat[m]> other access you explicitly grant it
12:21:17 <strcat[m]> that's how things work, and that's straightforward
12:21:28 <strcat[m]> if you don't want the app having data, don't give it the data
12:21:47 <strcat[m]> you are presumably giving it network access for it to work and network access is fundamentally on or off
12:21:56 <strcat[m]> any amount of network access allows exfiltrating to anyone
12:22:11 <strcat[m]> fine-grained filtering fundamentally does not work and is not how things work
12:22:14 <somenerd[m]> if you remove all permissions (on AOSP, btw) they can only track what you do in the app (the activities in the app)
12:22:40 <strcat[m]> apps start without permissions
12:22:57 <strcat[m]> the only exceptions are the Network and Sensors permissions added by GrapheneOS since they're non-standard extensions
12:23:30 <strcat[m]> you don't need to remove all permissions but rather don't grant them in the first place, or other forms of data access like explicitly granting it access to files/directories in your profile's home directory
12:23:48 <strcat[m]> you're in control of what the app has access to
12:23:52 <strcat[m]> you decide what they have
12:24:10 <strcat[m]> no need for privacy/security theater stuff like fundamentally not working fine-grained filtering stuff
12:24:36 <strcat[m]> if you give TikTok data, and presumably it has network access to work, then obviously they can send that data to their server and anyone else regardless of what fine-grained filtering you try to do
12:24:40 <strcat[m]> it makes no difference and doesn't work
12:24:55 <pizzaeater69[m]> No need to start explaining anything deeply but are you planning to have more permission toggles other than network and sensors?
12:25:11 <palmetto_moon[m]> No I'm not
12:25:14 <strcat[m]> there are no plans to add more non-standard permission toggles
12:25:26 <pizzaeater69[m]> Right got it

13:07:39 <Jibber> When I use multiple user account I can only install fdroid in one or the other account.
13:08:03 <Jibber> If I try to install in both it refuses to install.
13:08:48 <strcat[m]> Jibber: common upstream F-Droid issue caused by them publishing an out-of-date app version as the main download on their site
13:09:03 <strcat[m]> you can't install an older version of an app in another profile
13:09:07 <strcat[m]> part of downgrade protection
13:09:22 <strcat[m]> Jibber: tell them to fix it, they'll only do it if a lot of people express that this is problematic
13:09:26 <Jibber> OK thanks. I was sure I had it working last time in tried.
13:09:43 <strcat[m]> Jibber: probably because you installed the out of date version in one, then in the other
13:10:00 <strcat[m]> Jibber: if you update to the latest version via F-Droid then you can't install the out-of-date version in another profile
13:10:17 <strcat[m]> Jibber: you need to specifically download the latest version rather than using the main out-of-date download link on their site
13:10:21 <strcat[m]> it really doesn't make sense that they do this
13:10:33 <Jibber> OK got it. I will give it a crack
13:10:52 <strcat[m]> they claim that it's better to have people download an out-of-date version because the new one may have new bugs, but they just update everyone to that anyway... and if they want to have a beta channel they should implement that
13:11:00 <strcat[m]> rather than screwing up usability and giving people an out-of-date app version
13:11:09 <strcat[m]> file a bug with them
13:11:12 <strcat[m]> raise the problem in their community
13:11:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe don't use fdroid
13:12:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you serve an outdated version to your users because you fear the new one may have bugs for almost a year
13:12:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kinda shows incompetence
13:12:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do you really trust such people?
13:13:09 <Jibber> ....
13:16:17 <jpds> strcat[m]: f-droid does indeed offer a alpha/beta channel for their app: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
13:16:58 <strcat[m]> jpds: not really a 'channel'
13:17:32 <jpds> strcat[m]: It is, cause you have to explicitly choose to install the non-"suggested" version in their app
13:18:27 <strcat[m]> it's not what I'm referring to as a release channel
13:19:13 <strcat[m]> it doesn't function as one either in terms of what those releases are
13:19:22 <strcat[m]> or how opting in to them works
13:19:25 <strcat[m]> it isn't what I'm talking about
13:19:58 <strcat[m]> and again, if they don't think the latest normal release is stable enough to have people install that first, they should really set up release channels
13:20:05 <strcat[m]> rather than crippling usability and causing confusion
13:20:09 <strcat[m]> which creates a major support burden for us
13:22:45 <j-james[m]> Re. F-Droid, I noticed that updates to the Auditor app seem to ship through there before the background updater
13:22:47 <j-james[m]> Is that normal?
13:23:02 <strcat[m]> j-james: sounds like you're using izzy's repository
13:23:04 <somenerd[m]> Auditor's on F-droid?
13:23:09 <somenerd[m]> oh yeah, the repo
13:23:10 <strcat[m]> he ships our upstream Auditor releases
13:23:30 <somenerd[m]> should come in a similar amount of time
13:23:30 <strcat[m]> so yeah, you can install the official releases from any source as long as they are the proper official release + signed with same key
13:23:45 <strcat[m]> we don't do a new OS release immediately just because there's a new Auditor release
13:24:14 <strcat[m]> you can get the Auditor release from the Play Store, GitHub (both officially uploaded) or that unofficial repository sure
13:24:53 <strcat[m]> we aren't going to make our own F-Droid repositories
13:25:09 <strcat[m]> rather we're going to be funding work on making a modern / robust app install/update system as a replacement
13:25:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have a first party app update system planned
13:25:13 <j-james[m]> Ah, that's probably it, yeah
13:25:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Volunteers are welcome to work on it
13:25:44 <strcat[m]> we're looking for developers to work on various projects including this and we have a lot of funding available to fund a bunch of these projects
13:25:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It can be used to update stuff like auditor and ship high quality apps without needing a full blown OS update
13:25:55 <strcat[m]> we also have funding available for work on the OS and migration to Android 12
13:25:58 <strcat[m]> among other things
13:26:33 <j-james[m]> Are updates safe regardless of the source (F-Droid, etc) if they're signed?
13:26:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> j-james: yes
13:27:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> We use rsa4096 keys for our own apps
13:29:25 <strcat[m]> j-james: an *update* to an existing app is safe
13:29:37 <strcat[m]> the OS package manager performs signature verification, pinning and downgrade protection for every app
13:29:38 <strcat[m]> always
13:29:51 <strcat[m]> j-james: this does not mean unofficial repositories are safe in general
13:30:14 <strcat[m]> but sure installing an update to Auditor is safe because the OS package manager is verifying it
13:30:19 <strcat[m]> same for other apps
13:30:29 <strcat[m]> installing a new app is trusting the repository and F-Droid
13:30:43 <j-james[m]> That makes sense
13:31:08 <j-james[m]> Thanks for the explanation strcat and anupritaisno1
13:31:14 <strcat[m]> it all fundamentally has to go through the OS package manager which has signature verification, downgrade protection and the keys are pinned for any installed app
13:31:23 <strcat[m]> a key rotation has to be authorized by the previous key(s)
13:31:40 <strcat[m]> it's possible to move to a new app signing key but you have to sign the rotation with the old key
13:35:31 <IPFreely> hi
13:36:48 <IPFreely> Does microg 'break' privacy/security ?
13:40:06 <pizzaeater69[m]> <IPFreely "Does microg 'break' privacy/secu"> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html#microg-signature-spoofing
13:40:58 <somenerd[m]> it's been mentioned quite a few times before
13:40:59 <strcat[m]> IPFreely: in some ways, sure
13:41:07 <somenerd[m]> I'd suggest going through the logs: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
13:41:15 <strcat[m]> IPFreely: the typical way of integrating it has serious security consequences and severely damages the security model
13:41:35 <strcat[m]> IPFreely: a more careful and secure way of implementing it avoids most of that but not the other issues with it
13:41:59 <strcat[m]> IPFreely: it's inherently a very incomplete and much less robust/secure reimplementation of Google services and is focused on getting the subset they implement working rather than it being secure
13:42:15 <strcat[m]> and in some cases they seem against implementing the usual security checks
13:43:11 <strcat[m]> IPFreely: if you don't want to be pervasively using Google services, such as apps sending push messages through Google, then you wouldn't want to use it anyway
13:43:36 <strcat[m]> and if you do want that... well, it is problematic in various ways
13:50:21 <IPFreely> Thanks for the info. Well I want to Ungoogle, but in reality I might have to keep using Maps :/
13:53:27 <strcat[m]> IPFreely: a lot of the Google Maps app functionality works without Play services
13:53:32 <strcat[m]> and of course it can be used via a web browser
13:53:46 <strcat[m]> there are alternatives available based on OpenStreetMaps including ones with decent navigation
13:55:06 <IPFreely> That sounds good. Last time I tried OSM it was barely usable as daily navigation tool.. but that was some years ago, I hope things have improved. :)
14:02:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> Depends where you are based and whether there have been contributions
14:03:46 <IPFreely> Well, the location data was alright but the UI was rather counterintuitive.
14:04:38 <IPFreely> BTW is there a device list for compatibility?
14:04:52 <IPFreely> I have a Oneplus5T
14:05:21 <jpds> IPFreely: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
14:06:24 <IPFreely> thanks jp
14:09:40 <IPFreely> Ironic that a Google device is used to ungoogle :)
14:11:15 <strcat[m]> I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of GrapheneOS
14:11:21 <strcat[m]> recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/features
14:12:18 <pizzaeater69[m]> <IPFreely "Ironic that a Google device is u"> The point of GrapheneOS is not to ungoogle
14:13:03 <IPFreely> I see. Yeah, it was my goal to ungoogle. But definitely also to attain more privacy and security.
14:13:34 <strcat[m]> we don't include Google apps and services but we are not specifically against those services but rather bundling those kinds of things into the OS at all
14:14:02 <strcat[m]> we aren't going to bundle something like Protonmail any more than we would bundle Gmail
14:14:11 <strcat[m]> there aren't going to be third party apps and services built into the OS
14:14:28 <strcat[m]> we intend to offer our own hardened builds of certain third party apps in a first party repository
14:14:34 <strcat[m]> but we are not going to bundle them as system apps
14:15:24 <IPFreely> more user-customised experience that is
14:16:08 <strcat[m]> we're fine with people choosing to use Google services
14:16:13 <strcat[m]> but they won't be built into the OS
14:16:19 <strcat[m]> they won't have special privileges and capabilities
14:16:31 <strcat[m]> they are like any other third party service
14:17:18 <strcat[m]> Google could choose to make Play services into a user installable app not requiring deeply invasive integration/privileges
14:17:29 <strcat[m]> make it able to function in the usual app sandbox
14:17:45 <strcat[m]> no fundamental reason they can't
14:18:02 <strcat[m]> unlikely for them to choose to do that though, rather than being forced to do it via antitrust laws
14:18:51 <strcat[m]> the purpose of GrapheneOS is privacy, security and independence from any particular third party service providers, etc.
14:19:02 <strcat[m]>  * the purpose of GrapheneOS is privacy, security and to a much lesser extent independence from any particular third party service providers, etc.
14:19:09 <strcat[m]> which includes Google but is hardly limited to Google
14:19:30 <IPFreely> I like the idea of that
14:20:25 <strcat[m]> it shouldn't be the OS deciding which third party apps you use and bundling them into every OS update in the OS images, etc.
14:20:46 <strcat[m]> we do plan on making a first party repo with some useful apps, and we'll add a way to install apps from there as part of the initial setup wizard process
14:20:49 <strcat[m]> but they won't be bundled
14:20:52 <strcat[m]> and it will be opt-in
14:20:54 <strcat[m]> per app
14:21:27 <pizzaeater69[m]> Coool
14:30:45 <IPFreely> nice!
14:31:17 <IPFreely> Now I need to buy a Pixel 4a :D
14:31:36 <IPFreely> Got too many phones already
14:31:50 <IPFreely> But I just found out about this OS today.
14:51:48 <Xcutioner[m]> I got GrapheneOS installed yesterday and the calling and texting works great, but not data.  It found my Starightalk APN, but I can't get out with data.  Anyone have a similar issue?
14:52:14 <strcat[m]> make sure the APN is set up correctly
15:13:49 <johndoe454[m]> <IPFreely "Now I need to buy a Pixel 4a :D"> Bleh
15:13:53 <johndoe454[m]> Don't give google even more money
15:14:15 <johndoe454[m]> This is a solid OS but I doubt its worth buying a phone over
15:14:37 <strcat[m]> can you not concern troll here?
15:14:38 <strcat[m]> thanks
15:14:49 <johndoe454[m]> ?

15:22:32 <strcat> why???
15:22:47 <strcat> maybe they'll come back and start spamming / harassing me again
15:23:26 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not sure why they waste their time on some grudge

15:24:04 <somenerd[m]> (if it's Adam)
15:24:12 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Lmao, that ain't GrapheneOS job tho
15:24:26 <somenerd[m]> and they were told that quite a few times
15:24:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Or rather, the OS responsibility (and there are more higher priority projects anyways)
15:25:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> In which that self-proclaimed video that made 2FA supposedly work never appeared here again and made a PR
15:25:25 <somenerd[m]> and arguing in the channel isn't a good way to implement anything
15:25:38 <somenerd[m]> or saying it multiple times
15:25:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No rush anyways, prefer getting that right than breaking stuff by using what just "works"
15:26:27 <somenerd[m]> this is a bit offtopic though, maybe it's better to go to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
15:26:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yeah
15:47:44 <just-a-bugger[m]> From what i've viewed, people who review GrapheneOS tend to say that it has better battery life than the preinstalled OS they were using before. is there anything in particular GrapheneOS does to achieve this or is this just a side effect of not bundling apps or services
15:49:20 <ulmirdin[m]> Google stuff just drains the battery more
15:49:38 <strcat[m]> just-a-bugger: some of the security improvements such as disabling the Android Runtime JIT compiler and using full AOT compilation improve performance for Java/Kotlin code and reduce battery life
15:49:52 <strcat[m]> our hardening against memory corruption has overhead for C and C++ code
15:49:58 <strcat[m]> but most of what actually runs if Java/Kotlin
15:50:05 <strcat[m]>  * but most of what actually runs is Java/Kotlin
15:53:34 <damienrg[m]> Any direction to solve https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/483?
15:54:25 <damienrg[m]> Is it a problem in Messaging app of AOSP or somewhere else?
15:55:07 <strcat[m]> probably a Messaging app issue
15:55:15 <strcat[m]> the way to solve it, like other things, is for a developer to work on it
15:55:22 <strcat[m]> it's a low priority for us, so someone has to step up to do that
15:55:40 <strcat[m]> an alternative would be someone developing a better messaging app with compatible licensing, a focus on minimalism and security
15:55:59 <strcat[m]> and which understands that SMS, or even RCS, are undesirable legacy insecure things which should be phased out
15:56:04 <strcat[m]> rather than promoted
16:02:12 <damienrg[m]> OK. So I have to download AOSP source, code compile it and execute it. Can it be done in an emulator?
16:02:34 <damienrg[m]>  * OK. So I have to download AOSP source code, compile it and execute it. Can it be done in an emulator?
16:03:24 <strcat[m]> sure but you'd need to figure out how to test SMS in emulator, we don't have a guide on that and probably won't ever
16:03:29 <strcat[m]> can probably be done
16:12:50 <Xcutioner[m]> How do you Add APN's to GrapheneOS?  I don't see the option to add

16:27:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just don't
16:27:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Secure dns is theater
16:27:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're still sending SNIs unencrypted anyway
16:27:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> And really you're just encrypting connection to an RR
16:27:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> RR->Auth NS is unencrypted
16:27:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not use esni either
16:27:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Cloudflare and Mozilla went ahead and stupidly implemented a draft they call esni
16:28:23 <Xcutioner[m]> I heard about that
16:28:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> It isn't secure or private to use esni. It is an incomplete feature
16:29:10 <exm[m]> Goodevening,a question,
16:29:10 <exm[m]> Is there a MDM available to install on GraphenOs ?
16:29:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> ESNI has been superseded by ECH: https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/
16:29:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> exm: you can use any third party mdm that doesn't need GMS
16:29:47 <Xcutioner[m]> I wish I get update my APN settings.  Is there an option that blocks updates??

16:31:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Xcutioner[m] "I wish I could get my APN settin"> We don't implement any such option
16:32:10 <Xcutioner[m]> So how do you add or change your APN settings??
16:32:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> However we update APNs every security patch release and with these updates some carriers can set preferences to not allow users to change the APNs
16:32:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are aware of a few US carriers doing this
16:33:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't remove their restrictions. You should contact your carrier as to why they decided to implement those restrictions in the first place
16:33:54 <Xcutioner[m]> I don't care about the restrictions, I just want my data to work
16:33:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Often a carrier changes some stuff with their APN
16:34:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Xcutioner[m] "I don't care about the restricti"> Is it not working for some reason?

17:04:17 <strcat[m]> an issue with background stuff that started happening after last release is likely an app freezer incompatibility

17:21:56 <strcat[m]> you said 3a
17:22:14 <strcat[m]> 4a is a lot better than non-XL 3a
17:22:22 <szechuan2003[m]> yeah I was just curious, currently running Calyx on a 4A but I wanna move to Graphene. No reason not to use Graphene
17:22:38 <strcat[m]> better battery life than you have now
17:22:43 <strcat[m]> since we enable modern power management
17:22:49 <strcat[m]> despite the overhead of hardening
17:23:22 <szechuan2003[m]> Is there a point to charging to 100% before flashing to Graphene?
17:23:29 <strcat[m]> the hardening doesn't really hurt battery life unless you're running something pegging CPU usage at 100% and it happens to be the type of C or C++ code with performance hurt by the hardening against exploitation

17:51:56 <Vlu> Hi! I'm trying to flash GrapheneOS on Pixel 4a following the official CLI guide on ArchLinux. I was able to unlock the bootloader using fastboot. I downloaded, verified and extracted the images and ran "flash-all.sh". It is stuck without output, also after 1,5h and the phone still shows the bootloader screen (while lsusb still shows the phone). ps
17:51:56 <Vlu> shows that there is a process "fastboot flash bootloader b" (using 0% CPU) which I guess is the first command in the script. I tried aborting with Ctrl-C, but even that doesn't work. I guess I have to kill the process. Any ideas what the problem is / what I should do?
17:52:15 <strcat[m]> it immediately starts going
17:52:33 <strcat[m]> please read the info there about needing a reliable USB connection
17:52:45 <strcat[m]> and make sure you don't have adb running too (not meant to use it as part of installation)
17:52:52 <strcat[m]> Vlu: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
17:52:56 <strcat[m]> make sure to follow this, NOT an unofficial guide
17:53:09 <strcat[m]> Vlu: the #1 issue people have is an unreliable USB connection so make sure to read what's there about that
17:53:19 <strcat[m]> flashing takes a couple minutes
17:53:24 <Vlu> Yes, I read everything.
17:53:29 <strcat[m]> there's no reason to wait for it if it's stalled due to dropped USB connection
17:54:14 <Vlu> So (temporarily) dropped USB connection can show in no output?
18:02:18 <strcat[m]> Vlu: sure, you have an unreliable USB connection
18:02:29 <strcat[m]> Vlu: are you using the USB-C cable that came with the phone? or something else?
18:09:17 <Vlu> After switching the USB port it worked now (even the already running command started directly). For reference: It is a USB-A to C (Laptop has no C), I actually tried two different, and I used one of the cables realiably for Android debugging/adb with another phone [adb is not running now]; and I was able to unlock the bootloader on the Pixel with
18:09:17 <Vlu> it. The Pixel is also constantly shown under lsusb. This is why I do not really think it is the cable.
18:13:33 <Vlu> (I go confused by there not being any output while the phone shows connected in lsusb - maybe it could be worth a hint in the guide that no output and command being stuck can also be a sign of USB problems (of whatever sort...))
18:14:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> Hello all,Thanks for having me
18:14:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h​onorablepee> 😎
18:30:51 <jdodjrj[m]> Hehehheh
18:30:55 <jdodjrj[m]> I shit my pants
19:03:10 <Vlu> Sorry for having to ask again regarding installation - while flashing with fastboot seems to work fine now (flash-all.sh runs fine up to flashing custom key) there is a specific error regarding bootloader version:
19:03:11 <Vlu> Checking 'version-bootloader'                      FAILED
19:03:11 <Vlu> Device version-bootloader is 's5-0.3-6835615'.
19:03:12 <Vlu> Update requires 's5-0.3-7062598'.
19:03:12 <Vlu> So apparently a newer bootloader is needed on the device - but where should I get that from? I updated Android to the newest version from within the stock Android installation.
19:04:27 <strcat[m]> Vlu: the flashing process already installs the latest bootloader
19:04:44 <strcat[m]> Vlu: there's something going very wrong for you, I'd guess it's a USB issue
19:05:42 <Vlu> Very strange.
19:06:58 <Vlu> At which step does it install the bootloader?
19:37:06 <strcat[m]> first
19:37:17 <strcat[m]> so, I assume you're getting error messages
19:37:26 <strcat[m]> the AOSP flashing script isn't as robust as our web installer
19:37:49 <strcat[m]> it stop when it starts getting errors
19:37:57 <strcat[m]> you're getting errors because your USB connection doesn't work
19:38:32 <strcat[m]> ah, they left
19:38:54 <strcat[m]> anyway, it's the common issue of using a non-spec-compliant USB-A to USB-C cable
19:39:05 <strcat[m]> if you use a USB-A to USB-C cable it needs to be one that actually works properly
19:39:11 <strcat[m]> ~50% don't work properly
19:49:02 <Vlu> Here is how it worked out for me with flashing with fastboot: I executed each of the fastboot command from the flash-all.sh script manually, while rebooting to fastboot mode from the phone, and reconnecting USB each time. Apparently when using the script before, I got "fastboot: error: Failed to identify current slot" which was actually from the
19:49:02 <Vlu> bootloader flashing command, so the bootloader was not updated, and only the next steps succeeded, until failing at the last.
19:59:37 <json> I installed graphene a while ago with no issues, however, just a couple minutes ago, the phone started a boot loop (shows "Your device is loading a different operating system", flashes Google logo, and restarts). I can not turn the phone off; holding down the power button for +20s does not work. Could not find any info about this in the FAQ. Any
19:59:38 <json> resources on where to start? Its a Pixel 3 xl.
20:03:49 <strcat[m]> json: that sounds more like a hardware failure, not an OS thing
20:04:06 <strcat[m]> not the kind of thing that would be covered in the FAQ since it wouldn't be from GrapheneOS
20:04:32 <strcat[m]> json: you could see if it can boot recovery
20:05:04 <json> strcat[m] oh that sounds fun ... alright, ill give recovery a shot. thanks!
20:05:20 <strcat[m]> json: if the issue is a partial failure of the NAND flash in the SSD, you could potentially partially recover (temporarily at least) by sideloading the current version as an update to recovery
20:05:28 <strcat[m]> so that it writes out a full copy of the OS and switches over to using that
20:05:36 <strcat[m]> in case the current install is corrupted or something
20:05:48 <strcat[m]> if you can't boot recovery then there is not much hope of recovering your data
20:06:02 <strcat[m]> but chances are, if the storage still works at all, you can boot recovery
20:06:14 <strcat[m]> since it's just the kernel + initial ramdisk, pretty tiny
20:06:26 <json> good to know, thankfully most is backed up into nextcloud
20:07:12 <strcat[m]> ~1% or so of hardware fails and I have enough experience with it to guess what has gone wrong
20:07:41 <strcat[m]> this typically only happens with a 3a or 3a XL though due to the cheaper SSD
20:08:19 <json> I purchased second hand so that may also play into it
20:20:24 <strcat[m]> json: dunno, the type of failure isn't really what I'd expect to see based on it being second hand
20:21:03 <strcat[m]> fall damage / water damage tends to break camera sensors, USB port, and similar damage like that
20:21:08 <strcat[m]> this is something like the SSD failing
20:21:27 <strcat[m]> the most common issue from fall damage is that the OS can't connect to the camera anymore
20:21:28 <json> so i just ended up unlucky i guess
20:22:06 <strcat[m]> json: you might be able to *partially* recover
20:22:14 <strcat[m]> but I wouldn't trust the hardware from this point onwards
20:22:31 <strcat[m]> ideally recovery boots
20:22:34 <strcat[m]> and can successfully sideload update
20:22:42 <strcat[m]> and then maybe that boots by having a non-corrupt OS
20:22:45 <json> given that I have no way of getting the phone to shutdown, i am not too sure, adb will not be able to find the device
20:23:05 <json> (to attempt a foce shutdown)
20:23:08 <strcat[m]> json: is it stalled, or boot looping?
20:23:09 <Hank[m]2> Hi, I tried the official webUSB install and at the Flashing Factory Images step at one point it says 'Error:timeout of 10000 ms exceeded'. Can I just ignore that since I'm already at fastbootd screen?
20:23:14 <json> boot looping
20:23:15 <strcat[m]> if it's boot looping, hold volume down
20:23:17 <strcat[m]> and it'll boot fastboot
20:23:35 <strcat[m]> you go to fastboot by holding volume down when it boots, not actually with a key combination involving power
20:23:41 <strcat[m]> and then from there you can boot recovery
20:23:57 <strcat[m]> Hank: no, you can't ignore that
20:24:06 <strcat[m]> Hank: you've just barely started the installation at that point
20:24:14 <strcat[m]> Hank: you need a reliable USB connection, that's the issue
20:24:23 <Hank[m]2> <Hank[m]2 "Hi, I tried the official webUSB "> This is on PopOS and Chrome
20:24:24 <strcat[m]> the connection is dropping
20:24:36 <strcat[m]> either a program on your computer is interfering by grabbing the USB device
20:24:37 <json> strcat[m]: i can get to fastboot, but the options (volume up and down) send the phone back into looping
20:24:42 <strcat[m]> or more likely your USB port / USB cable is unreliable
20:25:06 <strcat[m]> json: yeah so then it's totally broken, to the point that it can't even successfully run the bootloader without the OS being involved at all
20:25:16 <Hank[m]2> Oh shoot. It's the official cable directly on a USB C port, I'll try another one
20:25:22 <strcat[m]> json: so, at that point, it's basically a brick
20:25:41 <json> lol, wonderful, well thanks for your help!
20:26:10 <strcat[m]> json: I haven't actually heard of this happening
20:26:28 <json> well there is a first for everything i guess
20:26:43 <strcat[m]> json: broken to the point it can't even cycle through that menu somehow
20:26:48 <strcat[m]> but not broken enough that it can't boot to there
20:26:49 <strcat[m]> weird
20:26:55 <json> indeed
20:27:40 <strcat[m]> maybe actually something worse than storage failure then
20:28:15 <strcat[m]> json: it's be worth opening it and seeing if something bad happened via fall damage
20:28:31 <strcat[m]> json: pretty slim chance of getting it working though
20:28:53 <strcat[m]> json: maybe try the fastboot thing again? it could be a loose connection or something
20:28:59 <strcat[m]> like the power disconnects
20:29:00 <strcat[m]> if you fiddle with it
20:29:05 <strcat[m]> shrug
20:30:25 <json> tried the fast boot a number of times, same result
20:30:41 <json> never dropped the device personally, purchased it openbox so no clue beforehand
20:31:26 <json> placing it on the changer for a bit just for the hell of it
20:32:03 <json> if nothing else, ill tear the thing apart once a replacement comes in
20:42:23 <Hank[m]2> <strcat[m] "the connection is dropping"> Can I continue on another computer? I tried swapping out cables and ports, but I have a Windoes 10 laptop from work I can try
20:43:45 <strcat[m]> sure
20:44:10 <strcat[m]>  * json: it'd be worth opening it and seeing if something bad happened via fall damage
20:54:36 <json> strcat[m]: ill be sure to do that
21:37:05 <vini28> hey. is there any way of uploading files using adb without getting the message "remote secure_mkdirs failed: Read-only file system"
21:37:08 <vini28> ?
21:42:12 <princemachiavell> Push to file to /sdcard/ ?
21:42:21 <princemachiavell> * Push the file to /sdcard/ ?
21:44:32 <vini28> thanks, that worked :)
21:58:25 <sierocharlie[m]> Hi all! I saw this in the release notes
21:58:25 <sierocharlie[m]> set GrapheneOS launcher as a default notification listener on fresh installs so that the default enabled notification integration is permitted by default like the stock OS (existing users still need to manually enable the permission for the built-in launcher)
21:58:25 <sierocharlie[m]> How exactly do I enable this permission and what permission does it refer to?
21:58:36 <sierocharlie[m]> For the grapheneOS launcher I only see file storage permission that I can grant.
22:11:13 <sphinx[m]> @sierocharlie: https://matrix.to/#/!omAJrepvwSfkXJrqbK:matrix.org/$1616424332309066QbHyU:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=tchncs.de
22:11:18 <strcat[m]> it's a special access permission
22:12:52 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks a lot! Didn't know. Appreciate the update
22:13:21 <sphinx[m]> eww Matrix links are ugly
22:25:21 <pkgbuild[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a special access permission"> So we should activate it?
22:26:10 <Pete> Hello, So the Auditor app checks the integrity of the Graphene os device, what would cause the integrity to fail?
22:26:19 <Pete> malware perhaps?
22:27:48 <flawedworld[m]> <pkgbuild[m] "So we should activate it? "> If you want to have notification dots, sure
22:28:32 <pkgbuild[m]> Dots nice 😁
22:41:04 <flawedworld[m]> <Pete "Hello, So the Auditor app checks"> An example of a failure would be a downgrade of the OS or the bootloader being tampered with. Another way it could fail would be if it fails to check in with the attestation server after a given time or the responses to the server are incorrect.
22:43:11 <Pete> flawedworld[m] I am doing the local verification, so it has no anti malware use ?
22:46:41 <flawedworld[m]> <Pete "flawedworld I am doing the local"> Local verification is still going to be performing OS verification.
22:50:14 <Pete> flawedworld[m] Sorry english is not my main language, what do you mean?
22:50:19 <Xcutioner[m]> Can anyone provide a screenshot of the network & internet setting?  I can't get my network data to work for anything.  I spent and hour on the phone with straighttalk and it seems like I'm missing some settings?
22:55:10 <flawedworld[m]> <Pete "flawedworld Sorry english is not"> When you use another android device to perform verification, you are still attesting the device integrity.

23:06:27 <IPFreely> Hi. could I get some suggestions which browser to install ?
23:07:06 <bypassbobby[m]> Thanks

23:09:03 <skwisgaar[m]> sphinx: my bad. I don’t use it so wasn’t really sure.
23:09:06 <IPFreely> nice one!
23:09:17 <Pete> flawedworld[m] thanks, if auditor doesnt detect malware would installing something like a malwarescanner add to security?
23:09:20 <IPFreely> Vanadium != Vivaldi Browser ?
23:10:20 <skwisgaar[m]> IPFreely: no connection
23:11:50 <IPFreely> Alrighty
23:12:53 <flawedworld[m]> <Pete "flawedworld thanks, if auditor d"> Malware scanners typically won't do much on the whole, and really the average malware scanner is just going to hunt for your average malware android app the user installed by mistake which asks for access to your contacts and sends them to the adversary once they grant it permission (just as a crude example). best thing i can suggest is to really just remain vigilant.
23:12:53 <flawedworld[m]> malware scanners also rely on the proven to not be not great concept of badness enumeration.

23:26:36 <southwest[m]> Molly 5.4.12 has auto update available right from the app. (under Advanced) Use the github link from flawedworld above, download the apk and you are set.
23:40:15 <Pete> @flawedworld doesnt malware make changes to the integrity of the graphene os device?
23:44:26 <flawedworld[m]> <Pete "@flawedworld doesnt malware make"> it depends, malware could be anything from a sketchy app the user installed to a full persistence exploit chain that opens a reverse shell on your phone. Not all malware will trigger it.
