01:41:36 <jjstopper[m]> Hello. In Grapheneos are users blocked from adding APN's?
02:16:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Privateer Monkey has joined the Telegram Group!
02:16:44 <lukasthegreat> Hii so I've been reading the FAQ, if I was to create a profile and use only Snapchat, no sim installed and a VPN used. Would Snapchat be able to spy on me and identify me
02:19:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Privateer Monkey> sorry for in and out fast hobby question: used phone security risks? Ive been trying to read up, but in short don't have time. Im curious if tampering at firmware level is plausible so that, say, graphene would no longer be secure.
02:20:42 <lukasthegreat> If I was to create a user profile, no sim card inatallled, use only WiFi over VPN, and only install Snapchat and only use Snapchat on that profile with limited permissions , what data would snap chat be able to see in terms of identifiers
02:21:46 <TheJollyRoger> It'd be able to see its own app ID, and enumerate other apps in that profile. It'd be able to tell that you are missing Play Services and have them disabled.
02:22:28 <TheJollyRoger> *or have them disabled
02:22:53 <TheJollyRoger> If it requested your IMEI or your SIM card serial number or subscriber ID or any other nonresettable hardware IDs, it would get an error.
02:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> Or it would get an empty value.
02:23:21 <TheJollyRoger> Android past version 10 does not allow apps to know non-resettable hardware IDs.
02:23:29 <lukasthegreat> But if in the user profile it was only Snapchat that was installed and only used for snap,would it be able to identify info used on owner profile?
02:23:47 <TheJollyRoger> No.
02:24:23 <TheJollyRoger> Profiles are separate workspaces. Nothing goes between them.
02:24:31 <lukasthegreat> Thanks that's good news
02:24:33 <TheJollyRoger> No data, no files, nothing.
02:24:52 <TheJollyRoger> If you wanted to move a file from one to the other, you'd do it the same way you would move files to another phone.
02:25:23 <lukasthegreat> Anyone know about wireguard vpns such as mullvad? Recommend? or better vpn
02:25:34 <TheJollyRoger> ie: register two accounts of an instant messaging or file sharing service, one in the owner profile and one in another, and then send it via that, or save it to a USB drive.
02:25:47 <lukasthegreat> Thanks jolly, much appreciated
02:25:54 <TheJollyRoger> VPNs are not topical to GrapheneOS. I'd recommend you ask in #grapheneos-offtopic, you're more likely to get answers there.
02:26:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, anything specific to GrapheneOS I could help you with?
02:27:35 <lukasthegreat> OK cheers, last question , encryption, if I've got my phone screen lock password set to about 20 characters and my phone was stolen , would a hacker be able to get into it?
02:28:00 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: so, with respect like questions like that...
02:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> Please understand when I answer that, it's very much like asking "Jolly, can you predict the future?"
02:28:22 <TheJollyRoger> So I'm going to say this:
02:29:28 <TheJollyRoger> If you end the session of a profile, it ejects the keys from memory for the given profile, and anyone who gains control of your phone must know the password to be able to derive the keys to that profile again.
02:30:18 <TheJollyRoger> So even if they took the phone apart, froze the RAM in liquid nitrogen and cold-imaged it, they can't extract the keys in this way because the keys for that profile aren't in memory.
02:30:42 <TheJollyRoger> At this moment, Zerodium lists a lock screen bypass exploit bounty as being "up to $100,000 USD."
02:31:13 <TheJollyRoger> Meaning that Zerodium, as an exploit broker, has decided that if you can find a way to bypass the lockscreen, it's worth about that much.
02:32:08 <lukasthegreat> Great news , I did ezp
02:32:29 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, remember that bypassing the lockscreen does nothing if the keys aren't in memory.
02:32:48 <lukasthegreat> Great news , I did expect this sort of answer I just don't know a lot about android lockscreen and encryption
02:33:21 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixels (and by extension, GrapheneOS) have a very very sophisticated hardware-bound encryption system which is detailed on the FAQ.
02:33:50 <TheJollyRoger> Because the encryption is uniquely bound to the hardware, the drive can only be decrypted on the phone that has encrypted it.
02:35:00 <TheJollyRoger> Because the security chip has its own internal clock buried deep within that tiny chip (if you want to know how tiny, it's a fraction of the diameter of a penny), it can enforce progressively lengthening timeouts.
02:35:26 <TheJollyRoger> So this way, even a 4-digit pin code would take roughly 650 years for the keying space of that 4 digit pincode to be completely exhausted.
02:36:12 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS allows you to go have up to 64 digit passphrases if you should so desire, because it's easier to remember "correct horse battery staple" rather than four random numbers that don't make sense.
02:36:44 <TheJollyRoger> And also it allows you to have a fallback to the cryptographic strength of your password, in the event a hypothetical exploit to the security chip is found a few years later.
02:36:48 <TheJollyRoger> However, I cannot tell you the future.
02:37:33 <TheJollyRoger> *64-character passphrases
02:37:40 <TheJollyRoger> I hope this might shed a little light on the situation for you.
02:38:11 <lukasthegreat> Yeah ive read the faq but i like to ask questions and get an answer in a conversation such as this. Ohhhh it makes sense now about 650 years,OK so let's say, logged into owner profile, if in a fantasy world ,phone is switched on and stolen, if someone knew how to freeze and remove the ram, would they then have access to the keys? But if the phone
02:38:12 <lukasthegreat> is turned off, does that mean they can't access the keys without password or future exploiting the chip?
02:38:48 <lukasthegreat> Yes ita great information for me thanks
02:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> If the phone is switched on, and the profile has been logged into, then, yes, the keys for the disk will be living in memory.
02:39:38 <TheJollyRoger> If the phone is turned off, or you have hit "END SESSION" on the profile, then the keys are flushed from memory.
02:39:49 <TheJollyRoger> Non-owner profiles can be ended this way.
02:40:04 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say you have a main profile called "Lukas" but then you have a second profile you have called "George."
02:40:28 <TheJollyRoger> when you start the phone, Lukas must be logged in, because Lukas contains important system configuration files which are essential to the operating system.
02:40:35 <TheJollyRoger> It can't run and have all its features without them.
02:40:43 <TheJollyRoger> However, what you /can/ do...
02:41:17 <TheJollyRoger> Now, remember that Lukas, no matter what, cannot see inside George. Sure, Lukas can *delete* George, or he can grant or deny George's access to the device's Phone number and SMS text messages.
02:41:32 <TheJollyRoger> *to use the device's Phone or send and recieve SMS text messages and access call logs.
02:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> But he can't do anything else.
02:42:06 <TheJollyRoger> So you could just use Lukas to boot the phone, then use George to do all your important secret confidential information, then when you are done, hit "END SESSION" on George.
02:42:19 <TheJollyRoger> At which point, George's keys are flushed out of memory.
02:42:39 <lukasthegreat> Ah yes I saw this when making a new user profile , fascinating information this
02:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
02:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> So let's say you do this...
02:42:53 <TheJollyRoger> and you have another profile called John, which you use for Snapchat.
02:43:24 <TheJollyRoger> And because we assume that John's information is public (but of course, that you don't want some rando on the street to see!) you leave John logged in all the time.
02:45:02 <TheJollyRoger> One day, a van pulls up beside you, and ninjas jump out, grab your phone, and make off with it before you have a chance to hit "power off." They take it to a secret lab, where the phone's memory is frozen with liquid nitrogen and they use all sorts of forensics devices and multimillion dollar chip engineering machinery (which may or may not exist in the real world) to extract the contents of
02:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> the memory.
02:45:41 <TheJollyRoger> John's keys are living in memory, so they find what was in John. Lukas was logged in, but you had nothing in Lukas that wasn't already available on the publicly switched telephone network (remember, publicly switched telephone network calls and texts are insecure)
02:45:59 <TheJollyRoger> But they won't find the keys for George because you kept logging George out when you were finished using the profile.
02:46:47 <TheJollyRoger> Note that this assumes they will never find, nor crack George's password.
02:48:06 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: hope this clears things up a bit for you?
02:49:10 <lukasthegreat> Ha yeah very good examples :) makes perfect sense yeah and very reassuring
02:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, glad it clears things up! P.-)
02:53:01 <lukasthegreat> So I've seen the Linux qubesos that uses compartmentalization and it seems this does too with user profiles, if you deny access to phone and SMS ofcourse. I would like to ask a question about using what's app in graphene but is this not the right place ?
02:55:16 <TheJollyRoger> Well, with respect to apps, it's generally done in the offtopic channel, but it depends on context. Although this is some time out of date, I have heard reports that WhatsApp works on GrapheneOS, if you can find the .apk.
02:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> Apps are fully sandboxed at all times, and can only see the information you permit them to, and can only communicate with apps that have opted in and whitelisted them specifically for inter-process communication. So even though you do have the app on your phone, it's still caged.
02:57:49 <TheJollyRoger> Apps are *always* sandboxed.
02:59:10 <lukasthegreat> Well I despise social media to be fair I am trying to get friends and family to move to telegram. But alot of people are sticking to whats app, however I don't mind using what's app on here providing its caged, I just wasn't sure if installing what's app would risk security and privacy
03:01:29 <TheJollyRoger> Installing it in and of itself doesn't risk privacy or security, it's giving the app information or granting it access to information that you don't want it to have.
03:06:29 <lukasthegreat> Yeah that makes sense. You know the vanadium browser, I'm happy using it but I usually use a password manager such as last pass, however I'm tempted to use this browsers save password feature or an offline password manager from fdroid. Any thoughts on the password feature in this browser ? Is there any information to look at regarding hardening the
03:06:30 <lukasthegreat> use of vanadium
03:06:54 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to hardening vanadium, this can be summed up in two words:
03:06:57 <TheJollyRoger> "You don't."
03:07:46 <TheJollyRoger> The thing with Vanadium is that great attention has been placed to make it appear to other websites as the same browser fingerprint as Google Chrome on the regular android, with Play Services and invasive DRM disabled.
03:09:23 <TheJollyRoger> Some of these options are applied at compile time; the source code has also been patched to make it more privacy preserving; for instance, rather than not sending the battery status of the phone, which would allow sites to request the battery level (and then could allow them to track via the battery status, or determine your browser is not sending information it should), it stubs the battery
03:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> out and makes it appear as if it's at 100% and charging.
03:09:53 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium takes advantage of the memory and sandboxing improvements in GrapheneOS to improve the sandboxing and isolation.
03:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> with respect to fingerprinting, browsers are very complex state machines. Your best hope is to blend in with existing traffic, not deviate from the norm.
03:11:01 <TheJollyRoger> Essentially, think of it this way:
03:11:09 <TheJollyRoger> Old joke: "Where do you hide an elephant?"
03:11:11 <TheJollyRoger> The answer is:
03:11:15 <TheJollyRoger> "In a herd of elephants."
03:14:26 <lukasthegreat> Yea ha makes sense, it would just be refreshing to be able to use a browser without getting advertisements everywhere or using a phone where you are having a verbal conversation with friends about dogs in person and then dog food pops up on advertisements
03:15:14 <TheJollyRoger> Of course. The reason we don't allow adblocking extensions in Vanadium is because generally that's how websites track your activity; they enumerate the advertising domains that you've blocked.
03:16:39 <TheJollyRoger> When people install apps like privacy badger, which learns by you choosing to hand-add more domains to it, that's tracking gold.
03:18:01 <strcat[m]> jjstopper: no, you aren't blocked from adding APNs, but some carriers disable it
03:18:18 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "ie: register two accounts of an "> Can i use a usb to transfer my keepass file for after factory reset how do i do that
03:18:58 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: Yes, you can use a USB drive. Look in the box your phone came in and you will find an adapter.
03:19:22 <TheJollyRoger> They will need to be formatted by the Android as FAT. I forget which variant of FAT it is.
03:19:55 <lukasthegreat> Yeah makes sense and crazy how its the opposite, next question and I think this might be my last, sorry for the questions but I'm seizing the moment. WiFi calling , if I use airplane mode, VPN and wifi calling , does the phone call route through the VPN?
03:20:13 <strcat[m]> yes
03:20:15 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: Yes.
03:20:40 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: if you want, you can check "Always On VPN" to make sure that the phone can't fall back to function without it.
03:20:49 <strcat[m]> VPN routes all traffic through it other than the low-level traffic for making the network / VPN work
03:21:44 <TheJollyRoger> Airplane mode will stop your phone from reaching the cellular network entirely; the code for the WiFi and the Cell radio is separately sandboxed.
03:22:55 <lukasthegreat> This is the mind boggling bit, if call is done by WiFi calling through VPN, its still going to be intercepted (if they were actually bothered) by the carrier , its not an encrypted phone call like using telegram is it ?
03:23:44 <TheJollyRoger> So, remember that calls routed to the publicly switched telephone network, are always going to be insecure.
03:24:10 <TheJollyRoger> They have to maintain reverse compatibility to touchtone telephones, after all, which have been around since what... 1980?
03:24:29 <TheJollyRoger> So even if your device is perfectly secure, your recipient's won't be.
03:24:45 <lukasthegreat> Yeah makes sense
03:25:03 <TheJollyRoger> So, use an instant messaging application, my go-to is Signal.
03:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> Android mandates that all apps use TLS, which protects all traffic from client (your phone) to server (the backend).
03:26:07 <TheJollyRoger> And when sent through the Signal network, all the messages are end to end encrypted, and use Sealed Sender to minimize metadata leaks.
03:28:58 <lukasthegreat> Oh great yeah , if I was to send a text via signal and the receiver doesn't have it, my carrier wouldn't see that I've sent a text to my friend but would my friends carrier would see what I've sent if they didn't have signal ?
03:29:55 <TheJollyRoger> If you were to send a text via Signal and the reciever doesn't have it, then Signal must fall back to unencrypted SMS which everyone on the cellular network can see. It will warn you with a gray button and "Send Insecure SMS?"
03:30:12 <TheJollyRoger> Some people for this reason, prefer to have a different app handle plaintext SMS, and not allow Signal to fall back in this manner.
03:30:18 <TheJollyRoger> But this varies from user to user.
03:30:32 <TheJollyRoger> Some like to have separation of application, some like to have it all in one.
03:31:25 <lukasthegreat> Is that so they have a clear reminder that they aren't sending secure by using a separate app
03:31:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
03:32:06 <TheJollyRoger> You can disallow Signal to send SMS if you want.
03:33:27 <lukasthegreat> Yeah I used to use it ,I'll try again , SMS don't work in airplane mode do they ? Unlike wificalling
03:34:19 <TheJollyRoger> No, it can't.
03:35:12 <TheJollyRoger> (If I recall right!)
03:35:31 <lukasthegreat> Is there a problem using a USB c - 3.5mm Jack for use with aux cable? If I plug in aux this way on pixel 5 it says anologue audio detected and can't be used
03:35:45 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "They will need to be formatted b"> Will graphene format the usb to FAT when i plug in a new usb?
03:36:04 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: there is. The USB adapter *must* support digital audio.
03:36:15 <TheJollyRoger> If it only does analogue, it won't work.
03:36:32 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: If it can't detect what format it is or the format is not compatible, you will be presented with the option to do so.
03:37:09 <Cliff[m]> TheJollyRoger out of curiosity why do you use signal and not something like molly
03:37:11 <lukasthegreat> Oh OK ive ordered official Google one as I was using huawei
03:38:33 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: Personal preference, that's all.
03:38:40 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: That should do it!
03:39:35 <lukasthegreat> What's molly
03:40:06 <TheJollyRoger> lukasthegreat: Molly is a fork of Signal which is maintained by one of the members here. He's added some of his own improvements to it, which many users here might like.
03:40:39 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "lukasthegreat: Molly is a fork o"> Ooo what sort of improvements?
03:40:50 <TheJollyRoger> You'll have to ask in #mollyim
03:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off for the night. I'll see you soon.
03:41:43 <TheJollyRoger> Fare thee well, shipmates.
03:42:44 <lukasthegreat> Cheers night
04:46:21 <communist_carpet> Hi everyone! Anyone willing to answer some of my questions?
04:47:16 <rny> just ask
04:48:26 <communist_carpet> I want to install Graphene, but I don't know if certain apps will work. I know its a privacy breach, but would apps like slack or a banking app still function?
04:48:49 <communist_carpet> (I assume no notifications from closed-source apps work on graphene)
04:49:13 <communist_carpet>  * I want to install Graphene, but I don't know if certain apps will work. I know its a privacy breach, but would apps like slack, discord, or a banking app still function?
04:50:48 <strcat[m]> > I assume no notifications from closed-source apps work on graphene
04:50:49 <strcat[m]> not accurate
04:51:03 <strcat[m]> > I know its a privacy breach
04:51:05 <strcat[m]> what?
04:51:12 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean by that
04:51:14 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed
04:51:27 <strcat[m]> security model doesn't work differently based on whether an app is open source or not
04:51:31 <strcat[m]> and open source != secure
04:51:36 <strcat[m]> open source != privacy respecting
04:51:47 <communist_carpet> <strcat[m] "not accurate"> I should clarify that, I assume no notifications from closed-source apps work on graphene for planning purposes, as I've heard its quite spotty sometimes
04:51:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
04:51:57 <strcat[m]> it's not accurate
04:51:59 <strcat[m]> please read the documentation
04:52:17 <communist_carpet> Ah, gotcha. Forgot there was documentation 🤦‍♂️ thanks!
04:52:29 <strcat[m]> it has little to do with whether an app is closed source but rather whether they have a hard dependency on Google's servers to deliver push messages
04:52:50 <strcat[m]> you're attributing things to apps being open vs. closed source that are unrelated
04:53:11 <strcat[m]> whether they are open or closed source only impacts whether the source code is available and licensed under an open source license
04:53:14 <communist_carpet> Yeah, thats my (wrong) assumptions that open source automatically mean secure & private, mb
04:53:25 <strcat[m]> does not make the app more secure, more privacy respecting or impact whether they use FCM as the only option for push
04:53:41 <strcat[m]> and the OS security model works regardless
04:53:44 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed
04:54:02 <communist_carpet> Awesome, so there would be no need for something like Shelter?
04:54:28 <strcat[m]> there is never a "need" for using profiles
04:54:30 <strcat[m]> please read the docs
04:54:44 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed, Shelter does not provide a better or stricter app sandbox, that is not what profiles do
04:55:06 <strcat[m]> taking advantage of profiles is useful but the purpose of it is not sandboxing, not what it does
04:55:23 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed, regardless, and that's not something specific to GrapheneOS
04:55:44 <communist_carpet> Ah, that makes more sense. Thanks for the help! I look forward to reading the docs :)
05:42:59 <phikoen[m]> Hey there! Are there any plans to include a TTS engine on the upcoming releases? I am using OSMand+ for navigation and the only feature which I'm missing is TTS.
05:56:35 <phikoen[m]> <phikoen[m] "Hey there! Are there any plans t"> Found a TTS engine on f-droid which is called espeak-ng. Working like a charm! 😁
06:00:38 <strcat[m]> TTS doesn't have to be bundled to work
06:16:25 <strcat[m]> espeak-ng is GPLv3 so we wouldn't consider bundling it
06:17:00 <strcat[m]> also missing Direct Boot support, just filed an issue about that: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/issues/917
06:22:44 <jalb> Hi!, one question: if I use a VPN in some profiles, do I need to use a VPN in the admin/main profile too for privacy reasons?, I don't know if the admin profile could be saying who I am when I'm connecting to a VPN in another profile. Thanks
06:26:02 <strcat[m]> you should set up the VPN in each profile
06:26:06 <strcat[m]> for when you switch profiles
06:26:20 <strcat[m]> ideally it would work a bit differently than it does
06:26:30 <strcat[m]> ideally it would be a per-profile VPN instead of the active profile controlling the VPN
06:26:43 <strcat[m]> I think the intention is for it to move towards that
06:27:42 <jalb> thank you strcat[m]
06:28:10 <jalb> And the same country or could it be a different country in each profile?
06:30:13 <helloworldkk87[m> Doesnt really matter
06:30:45 <strcat[m]> jalb: you can use a different VPN / different configuration for each profile
06:30:56 <strcat[m]> just be aware the active profile configures the network for the whole device, including VPN
06:31:07 <strcat[m]> it is not (yet) separate per-profile
06:31:23 <strcat[m]> but I do think it's intended to become that way, eventually, but I think it's a pretty low priority for them
06:31:40 <strcat[m]> we want to have it per-profile, but actually per-profile, not just configured by the active one
06:33:39 <jalb> ok, thanks a lot
06:35:16 <jalb> "just be aware the active profile configures the network for the whole device, including VPN
06:35:39 <jalb> do you mean to avoid leaks and avoid connections without the VPN?, I do that
06:48:07 <noax8[m]> I just want to say thank you so much for the work to the developers. Awesomeness!!!!
06:52:34 <jalb> yes, thank you all!

08:33:11 <Susi> Hi
08:35:06 <Susi> how are you? I'm dealing with problems to install GrapheneOS on my phone. Maybe someone can help me with this?
08:37:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Susi: are you using the web installer?
08:44:28 <Susi> Yes I want to use it, but when I klick on the "unlock the bootloader" button only "Error: No device selected." occurs. GrapheneOS is searching for connection
08:46:24 <strcat[m]> did you follow the instructions leading up to that?
08:46:30 <strcat[m]> please explain what you've done so far in detail
08:48:31 <Susi> At the "connecting  the phone" they say that I may need to install fastboot on windows and that I should have a look at the windows optional updates. As there were no Updates provided I went on to the next section"unlocking the bootloader. I also already downloaded the platform tools (adb and fastboot) from
08:48:31 <Susi> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
08:49:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can install the google usb driver manually
08:49:39 <strcat[m]> Susi: no, that's incorrect
08:49:53 <strcat[m]> Susi: are you using the web installer or the CLI install guide?
08:49:56 <strcat[m]> please follow one, not both
08:50:13 <strcat[m]> and please do not use third party guides, they're nearly all incorrect and dangerous
08:50:33 <strcat[m]> the fact that you're talking about platform-tools while using web installer is concerning especially since you mention adb, which is not involved in the installation process
08:50:48 <strcat[m]> this indicates you've been misled by unofficial guides and may have screwed up the computer
08:51:00 <Susi> ah okay sorry as there was no connection I downloaded platform tools to try to get a connection
08:51:10 <strcat[m]> Susi: please follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web exactly as documented there
08:51:17 <strcat[m]> remove whatever you've done from other sources
08:51:24 <strcat[m]>  * remove whatever you've done based on other sources
08:51:35 <Susi> ok, then i will delete platform tools
08:51:51 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
08:51:59 <strcat[m]> the part about the driver there is important
08:52:01 <strcat[m]> you can't skip that
08:52:21 <strcat[m]> the phone is supposed to be booted into the bootloader interface and connected to the computer at that point
08:52:25 <strcat[m]> you must do things in order as it explains
08:52:28 <strcat[m]> can't skip anything
09:04:40 <Susi> ok, I got through the install guide once again. (Updated my phone, looked if my browser is up to date, enabledOEM unlocking, got into bootloader interface on my phone, connected my phone to the computer At the "connecting the phone" section it says i have to install fastboot and therefore look at Windows Optional Updates. But there are no drivers
09:04:40 <Susi> available to install. So I will skip as mentioned in this section.
09:05:50 <Susi> by the way. Thanks for helping me! :)
09:08:19 <Susi> The device state is locked now. I will go on to the "unlocking the bootloader" section.
09:10:58 <Susi> Now I clicked on the unlock the bootloader button, but there is only the " GrapheneOS wants to establish a connection. No compatible devices found." Popup and "error: no device selected.
09:11:23 <organicmints[m]> Why graphene os only on Pixel ( a Google phone). I am new to this sorry for the naive question
09:11:54 <Susi> I bought a new Pixel 4a in a store on tuesday :)
09:12:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> With molly version of signal , what is difference for molly and molly staging on fdroid
09:22:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> @lp4678 you have been asked to go to the offtopic chat before by an admin
09:43:13 <Susi> should i manually install Google USB Driver or where should i get the fastbootdriver from, if my i don't get any drivers from windows update -->optional updates --> driver
09:43:45 <strcat[m]> Susi: you shouldn't skip that section
09:43:51 <strcat[m]> and it sounds like your USB connection may not be working
09:44:04 <strcat[m]> please read what it says about using the cable that comes with the device or a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable
09:44:05 <Susi> but from where do I get the drivers?
09:44:09 <strcat[m]> most USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
09:44:12 <strcat[m]> it explains how to get it
09:44:31 <strcat[m]> it won't show up if the device isn't connected with USB
09:44:39 <strcat[m]> perhaps you're using a charge-only cable or a broken cable/port
09:44:41 <strcat[m]> it covers that
09:44:43 <Susi> hmm I bought a 56kOhm USB A-USB-C cable from anker
09:45:19 <strcat[m]> use a different USB port
09:45:28 <strcat[m]> reboot the computer
09:45:31 <Susi> I can connect my phone to the computer, when i start the google android which is preinstalled
09:46:24 <Susi> okay, I will try using a drifferent port and reboot
09:46:26 <Susi> thanks
09:48:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> Oh yeah sorry I keep forgetting

14:00:10 <luddi> Hello everyone.
14:00:10 <luddi> I noticed that with grapheneos Spotify connect does not find devices I am not directly logged in to. A quick search suggests that it relies on zeroconf. Are zeroconf/link-local addresses disabled in graphene? Or is there another reason or maybe a way to fix this?

18:20:30 <failbetter[m]> Hey folks, is there a way to move files between user profiles on graphene?
18:22:29 <strcat[m]> failbetter: network, like transferring them with an E2E encrypted Element chat with yourself, or another network-based approach
18:22:37 <strcat[m]> you can do it over localhost
18:22:55 <strcat[m]> there isn't a way other than using the network or something like moving to/from a flash drive with the file manager
18:23:12 <strcat[m]> no way for apps to share data or communicate between profiles (aside from network)
18:23:21 <failbetter[m]> Interesting approach!
18:24:43 <failbetter[m]> Is there a good way of telling applicaitons they have access to things like location but they actually don't
18:28:33 <grapheneos_user_> <failbetter[m] "Is there a good way of telling a"> No, they can detect access
18:28:43 <grapheneos_user_> At most you could give false location
18:29:07 <failbetter[m]> That's what I mean is it possible to fake location?
18:29:09 <strcat[m]> that doesn't really work because they can look at the detailed GPS info etc
18:29:16 <strcat[m]> failbetter: yes but apps can detect it
18:29:17 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "that doesn't really work because"> Ah
18:29:25 <strcat[m]> the feature doesn't try to hide that it's active (mock location)
18:29:38 <strcat[m]> it deliberately exposes that it's active (can see location is being mocked)
18:29:42 <strcat[m]> and even if it didn't you could do that
18:29:43 <grapheneos_user_> <strcat[m] "that doesn't really work because"> Unless you spoof the detailed info :P
18:29:54 <grapheneos_user_> But yeah there are so many ways around it
18:30:11 <strcat[m]> look at SatStat for an example of the data that's available
18:30:23 <strcat[m]> you can get detailed info on the GPS, GLONASS, etc. sats
18:30:26 <bluecream[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "Unless you spoof the detailed in"> Didnt the guardian project wrote an app for that porpuse?

18:31:12 <grapheneos_user_> Can't avoid it

If I try to restore via flash drive instead, then I don't see how considering the backup.ab is 12GB and fat32 only supports 4gb
18:43:48 <failbetter[m]> I assume you can't get notifications form another profile?

18:50:13 <covid-1984[m]> and AuroraDroid works well for FDROID apps
18:50:45 <DemiMarie> <covid-1984[m] "Demi Obenour: idk what you mean "> My question is mostly about security and the quality of the AuroraStore implementation.

19:01:09 <covid-1984[m]> I see Daniel said "Either wait until the in-development Backup up is completed and included or use adb backup / adb restore which requires developer options and is aimed at developers. It's the same underlying backup system infrastructure as a backup service app though."

22:56:43 <Alex54> Hello everyone. I'm having an issue reverting my Pixel 3a XL (Bonito) from GrapheneOS to Stock Android. My device boots into the bootloader & says "no valid slot to boot". I followed the CLI guide on the main website step by step while using the stock system image files provided by Google. Please help!
23:29:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Alex54, you should use the web tool at https://flash.android.com, and use the "remove key" button at https://grapheneos.org/install/web to distrust the GrapheneOS AVB key. This is much safer and much easier than using the commandline guide.
23:29:52 <TheJollyRoger> *than using the commandline method.
23:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> You will need a supported browser like Chrome.
23:30:59 <Alex54> TYSM for your response TheJollyRoger! I'm going to try this right now.
23:31:12 <TheJollyRoger> Alex54: great!
23:32:05 <TheJollyRoger> so, there's one extra step: you'll need to use the "Remove AVB Key" button from the GrapheneOS web installer before you lock the bootloader with the Google OS installed. That just tells the secure element to get rid of the unneeded GrapheneOS keys if you are no longer running GrapheneOS.
23:32:21 <TheJollyRoger> That's the only difference. The Android web flash tool will take care of the rest.
23:33:12 <TheJollyRoger> Note that if for some reason the web flash tool fails, do not immediately go about trying the commandline method, because the web flash tool is much more robust. If it should fail and you have a supported OS and a supported browser, then you've got a problem with either drivers on your computer, your computer hardware itself, or your cable.
23:34:33 <Alex54> TheJollyRoger: Got it!
