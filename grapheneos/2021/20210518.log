00:00:35 <M7777777y[m]> I also wanted to use the VPN mode where it uses orbot to route tor to certain apps, and have it set to always on and block non-vpn(tor) connections
00:00:48 <M7777777y[m]> However I find this to be unusable unless I'm routing every app through tor because it doesn't allow non tor apps any internet
00:01:04 <M7777777y[m]> When really it would be nice to have only certain ones always forced through tor
00:02:11 <dazinism> Yeah, as you worked out, thats not possible.
00:02:35 <M7777777y[m]> Is there a technical barrier to this? Because I can't imagine I'm the only one who would want this
00:03:24 <dazinism> Can use a secondary user profile though with orbot vpn always on, and blocking connections
00:03:59 <M7777777y[m]> That was my backup plan
00:04:01 <M7777777y[m]> Although a bit clunky
00:04:34 <dazinism> In that case probably best to have your 'main' user be another secondary user
00:04:48 <M7777777y[m]> Hulk I will read that link now, thanks
00:07:59 <dazinism> The other thing you could do is use app network permissions, only allow them when orbot is active
00:08:35 <dazinism> Secondary user is likely easier/safer though
00:10:48 <M7777777y[m]> I didn't see any options like that, I imagine that is some kind of manual configuration?
00:11:00 <dazinism> I think best to logout/end session on your main secondary user before switching to the orbot secondary user
00:12:08 <dazinism> 7y: network permission is in android settings with other app permissions
00:15:29 <M7777777y[m]> Oh you mean to like manually go and do it only when orbot is active
00:17:00 <dazinism> Yeah

02:46:17 <_johnson> GrapheneOS-Teleg Hi there! I booted my pixel into bootloader interface, connected it to another pixel, and unlocked the bootloader.
02:47:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeeii
02:47:14 <_johnson> I clicked download release, and let the factory image download for and hour or so....
02:47:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> proceed to the next step
02:47:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you're not using incognito mode, right?
02:47:49 <_johnson> but before it completed, it stopped and said: "Error: undefined"
02:47:57 <_johnson> no I'm not.
02:48:08 <_johnson> It's done this twice¬† now.
02:48:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> huh strange
02:48:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> lets clear the chrome browser first
02:48:58 <_johnson> I'm not sure what to do about it.
02:49:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you don't have any important data in the chrome browser right?
02:49:27 <_johnson> no, it's a brand new phone.
02:49:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> good, then go ahead and clear everything up
02:49:56 <_johnson> will the other phone be fine since it's unlocked?
02:50:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, it's fine
02:50:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nothing bad will happen, you can even unplug it for now
02:50:54 <_johnson> Okay, so what exactly should I do with Chrome?
02:52:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> go to privacy setting inside of the chrome
02:52:35 <_johnson> okay...
02:52:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> clear all history, caches, everything
02:53:04 <_johnson> done.
02:54:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> now quit chrome
02:54:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> long press the icon
02:54:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> app info
02:54:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> clear all data
02:55:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (this is to ensure that all settings are at their defaults)
02:55:31 <_johnson> clear storage and cache?
02:55:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
02:56:04 <_johnson> done.
02:56:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> now make sure that it is connected to wifi or smth
02:56:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> connect the phones and try again, from the beginning
02:57:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (try unlocking the bootloader again, just to make sure)
02:57:29 <_johnson> okay...it'll take another hour or so.
02:57:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> why?
02:57:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the download should be pretty quick
02:58:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's only a ~1.5gb image
02:58:20 <_johnson> It took about 1 hour for the download to get 75% done...
02:58:51 <_johnson> and you want me to "unlock" it even though it already is?
02:59:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, unlock again
02:59:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's a sanity check
02:59:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> maybe you better find a more reliable network?
02:59:55 <_johnson> okay... I'm opening Grapheneos now.
03:02:07 <_johnson> i clicked download release and it says "downloading blueline-factory etc."
03:02:28 <_johnson> and it looks like it will take the same amount of time as before...
03:03:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> alright, as you are using pixel to install GrapheneOS on pixel, by using Google's cable
03:04:07 <_johnson> so just let it go on downloading?
03:04:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should be facing no troubles in terms of installation issues
03:04:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, but keep an eye on the phone downloading
03:05:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> at some point while sleeping it might doze, and therefore it would kill the background task of downloading
03:05:10 <_johnson> it's already been through about 2.5 hours of downloading and the battery is at about 40% now...
03:05:51 <_johnson> I set the sleep to the maximum of 30 minutes and try to keep an eye on it...
03:06:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the whole installation procedure from the very beginning takes about 15 mins
03:06:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this includes the download time
03:06:39 <_johnson> Is there any other way I can try doing it?
03:06:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if it fails to download again, find a better wifi/ sit closer to your router
03:07:15 <vdh7[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> try looking here as well"> I saw there's an app compatiblity list !
03:07:36 <_johnson> okay.... can I unplug it from the other phone and start charging it while it loads?
03:07:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ask people that use your wifi, to temporarily stop using it
03:07:47 <_johnson> okay.
03:07:58 <vdh7[m]> but what's the threshold for gold/silver list?
03:08:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> actually, yes, you can unplug and charge!
03:09:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you might even want to use 4G / 5G to download the image
03:09:40 <vdh7[m]> I see google maps is even listed as gold tier. Does someone know what the google maps app leak without google play services?
03:10:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> vdh7[m]: your questions better suited in off-topic room
03:11:11 <_johnson> I can switch over to a 5G network.
03:11:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, go for 5G instead
03:11:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> waiting hours for a small download is unbearable
03:12:28 <_johnson> okay so when I switched over it threw the same error code.... I'll restart the download.
03:13:59 <_johnson> I put it by the router and it sill seems to be as slow as ever.
03:15:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is it still as slow, when you are using 5g?
03:16:03 <_johnson> yes.
03:17:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that's sad
03:17:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> anyway, i'm off to sleep
03:18:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> most peeps here will be able to help you
03:18:13 <_johnson> okay. Thanks for the help!
03:18:26 <_johnson> okay.
03:18:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> just tell them these keywords: "installing from pixel to pixel using web"
03:18:52 <_johnson> do i just leave my phone in unlocked bootloader?
03:18:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and they will know exactly what to do
03:19:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can turn it off till the download is finished
03:19:40 <_johnson> by toggling to the power off?
03:19:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> btw, you're not using some sort of vpn or anything, right?
03:19:59 <_johnson> no.
03:20:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, select the power off
03:20:08 <_johnson> done.
03:20:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, good
03:20:22 <_johnson> btw, where do I ask that question?
03:20:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> good luck have fun!
03:20:31 <_johnson> "installing from pixel to pixel using web"
03:20:41 <_johnson> Thanks!
03:20:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> here, in this room
03:20:59 <_johnson> alrightly! i appreciate it!
03:22:13 <_johnson> To anyone who can answer this: How do I install Grapheneos on one pixel from another pixel?
03:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hi _johnson, the way you do it is simply connect the two of them together with the USB-C-to-C cable in the box.
03:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> Then you boot one to the bootloader, and use the web installer on the other.
03:24:53 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need the USB-C-to-C cable that's in the box to do it, or one by Anker or Aukey.
03:25:47 <TheJollyRoger> Goodnight @Hulk, sleep well.
03:26:45 <_johnson> Hi @TheJollyRoger, I did everything you said; I used the included USB-C-to-C, booted into bootloader, and tried the web install, but everytime I tried downloading the factory image, it took about 1 hr and failed in the end saying "Error: undefined."
03:26:57 <_johnson> I'm not sure why>
03:27:03 <TheJollyRoger> _johnson: are you in incognito mode when you do this?
03:27:24 <_johnson> No.
03:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> And you're using Vanadium...?
03:27:57 <TheJollyRoger> (Just a quick sanity check!)
03:28:37 <_johnson> No, I'm using Chrome. (The phone I'm working off of is new and still running Android.)
03:28:54 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, Chrome should work... that's really bizarre.
03:29:21 <TheJollyRoger> I'm stumped, someone in here more expert than I might have to help you out :(.
03:29:39 <_johnson> Right now I'm going to try the process off of a windows10 laptop... we'll see if it works.
03:29:55 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. That should do it, if you run into any problems, holler.
03:30:05 <_johnson> I'll do so. Thanks!
03:30:09 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
03:32:41 <bt1[m]> Why arepoplane mode is preferable option? What types of security and privacy issues do I avoid?
03:32:43 <bt1[m]> * Why arepoplane mode is a preferable option? What types of security and privacy issues do I avoid?
03:33:20 <TheJollyRoger> Airplane mode stops the phone's radios from transmitting, although you can switch WiFi back on if you want.
03:33:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <bt1[m] "Why arepoplane mode is preferabl"> Airplane mode will turn off any radios, and turning off the cellular radio prevents cell tower triangulation
03:34:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Cell tower triangulation is basically:
03:35:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> A cell tower sees how far you are, and can make a circle showing your possible locations
03:36:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Then another cell tower sees that you are a certain distance away from it, and it makes a circle showing your possible locations
03:37:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The circles intersect at 2 points: your 2 possible locations
03:37:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Repeat with one more cell tower, and the intersection point of all three circles is your location
03:38:21 <_johnson> @TheJollyRoger I can't get any device, other than the other pixel phone, to connect or recognize my device, so I'm not sure what to do.
03:39:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hey _johnson, that is really bizarre. On Windows 10, you may need to plug in the phone and run Windows update and check for an optional update to get the Android bootloader driver... but that's the only thing I can think of.
03:41:06 <_johnson> Okay.. well I'll try that.
03:41:39 <TheJollyRoger> *plug in the phone while it's in Fastboot mode
03:41:43 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
03:41:44 <TheJollyRoger> fingers crossed!
03:41:55 <_johnson> okay. Hahaha
03:42:01 <TheJollyRoger> That did it? :O
03:42:09 <bt1[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Repeat with one more cell tower,"> Oh I see and who can access to this information? Expect the police of course. And is this process doing continuously?
03:42:13 <TheJollyRoger> Heads up... it may or may not ask you to reboot if it does.
03:42:48 <_johnson> no...i'm just trying now.
03:42:59 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
03:43:34 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step off the computer for a bit, but this channel's usually fairly active at night, if not there's usually someone around tomorrow during the day.

03:44:28 <_johnson> Great, thanks!
03:44:38 <TheJollyRoger> Luck!
03:44:45 <_johnson> thank you!
03:45:36 <bt1[m]> <bt1[m] "Oh I see and who can access to t"> And is cellullar triangulation the only possible threat?
04:15:40 <_johnson> If I've unlocked my bootloader but haven't flashed anything, can I relock the bootloader and be fine?
05:12:14 <sb13x[m]> <_johnson "If I've unlocked my bootloader b"> Yes, so long as nothing has been flashed the original stock ROM should still be present.

07:05:51 <strcat[m]> @slowthink you're misunderstanding how memory works
07:08:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s‚Äãlowthink> I know how memory works but i have almost nothing opened
07:09:19 <strcat[m]> so, you don't know, because the OS always tries to use 100% of memory
07:09:26 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure why you think that's a problem
07:10:55 <strcat[m]> all memory is used for kernel caches (file data and metadata) and cached apps
07:18:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Why does a OS that? Im a newbie
07:18:39 <strcat[m]> the memory is there, it's supposed to be used
07:19:05 <somenerd[m]> to improve performace probably
07:19:07 <strcat[m]> adding more memory primarily provides more room to cache more things
07:19:22 <somenerd[m]> there's no use keeping unused memory and having worse performace
07:19:24 <strcat[m]> there would be no point of going from 4GB -> 6GB -> 8GB memory on the phone other than caching more things
07:19:29 <somenerd[m]>  * there's no use keeping unused memory and having worse performance
07:19:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Hmm Ok

10:42:58 <GhostSplinterSix> Okay.
12:06:53 <tasanox[m]> Hello all! I've recently started eying GrapheneOS for my next phone, however, I like to pay with my phone with NFC and that doesn't seem to work without Play Services. Is there a way of getting Google Pay or something else working? Or is that just a compromise you have to make?
12:12:25 <TheJollyRoger> Hi tasanox[m], it's just a compromise you'll have to make. Some aspects of Play Services are considered to be invasive and they need to be deeply integrated into the phone and given special privileges, both of which are mutually exclusive with GrapheneOS' goals, so as a result GrapheneOS will not bundle Play Services. GrapheneOS supports the use of NFC, but Play Services are a no-go.
12:13:03 <tasanox[m]> I figured as much. Is there anything similar that doesn't need Play Services? Like PayPal?
12:13:15 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure, I haven't tried it. There's a bit of nuance on this:
12:14:35 <tasanox[m]> I'm using a LineageOS phone to test what works without Play Services and what doesn't before I buy a Pixel device later this year, and PayPal crashes on startup for me... hmm
12:14:41 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS supports the use of NFC provided the apps bundle their own functionality for it; upstream Chromium (and Vanadium) actually use a library in Play Services for NFC, so they don't currently work with NFC. However, apps like OpenKeyChain do work with NFC because OpenKeyChain bundles its own, rather than using Google's. We're hoping that sometime in the future someone may contribute the
12:14:44 <TheJollyRoger> library.
12:15:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, unfortunately some apps are hardcoded to be dependent on Google's services, and then don't function in their absence.
12:16:02 <tasanox[m]> Is there any progress on the Google stub mentioned on GitHub? Or is that far off in the future?
12:21:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It'll be there when it is commited into the source code
12:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> It's still on the to-do list, we're hoping someone might be able to contribute it.
12:21:50 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> * It'll be there when it is committed into the source code
12:24:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, nature of open source, my friend! Everything is dependent on volunteers and contributors stepping up to do their part, what we collectively put in, the whole world gets out.
12:26:42 <tasanox[m]> Ah, well sadly all I can contribute is some money every month. I kind of wished you could donate money to specific projects
12:26:43 <somenerd[m]> >Yeah, unfortunately some apps are hardcoded to be dependent on Google's services, and then don't function in their absence.
12:26:43 <somenerd[m]> As well as many APIs needed in the OS
12:26:55 <somenerd[m]> Which then need to be filled in by GrapheneOS
12:27:00 <TheJollyRoger> tasanox[m]: Hey, thanks for your support!
12:28:09 <tasanox[m]> No problem!
12:28:09 <tasanox[m]> What's the recommended desktop OS by the way? If there is one, I mean
12:28:16 <TheJollyRoger> Usually most projects (GrapheneOS included) do have a digital tip jar; GrapheneOS accepts bitcoin and monero, but I think a few other projects usually just list their bitcoin address on their github accounts.
12:28:43 <TheJollyRoger> Well, desktop operating systems aren't topical to GrapheneOS, but! we do have a #grapheneos-offtopic channel and you're very likely to get some good, high-quality answers there.
12:29:01 <tasanox[m]> Will check that out! I thought this was the only room
12:29:25 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome, nah, we do have a couple others, this is just the one that's usually the place to go for questions directly relating to the project itself.
12:29:45 <somenerd[m]> >Awesome, nah, we do have a couple others, this is just the one that's usually the place to go for questions directly relating to the project itself.
12:29:45 <somenerd[m]> There are more than 2?
12:30:05 <somenerd[m]> Or are you including private rooms?
12:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> Well there's the beta-testing channel, but that's only used for me to broadcast "heads up, update coming!"
12:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> So that beta testers can be ready.

13:48:05 <TheJollyRoger> Endermen1094: Android Open Source Project is our upstream provider. GrapheneOS aims to improve the security and privacy characteristics of AOSP and make the result into a fully production-ready, day-to-day usable operating system and has accomplished numerous goals to meet that end.
14:03:01 <TheExplorer[m]> Are there any downsides in using another launcher than GrapheneOS' launcher ? I recently discovered open launcher and it's a lot better in terms of customizability
14:15:19 <thebiblelover7[m> <TheExplorer[m] "Are there any downsides in using"> there's also LawnChair which is what I use
14:31:58 <TheExplorer[m]> <thebiblelover7[m "there's also LawnChair which is "> Yea but it's not fully open source and doesn't have as many features
14:34:37 <TheExplorer[m]> It doesn't answer my question though...
14:47:36 <yolandheroux[m]> Hello
14:47:36 <yolandheroux[m]> Witch Pixel is better to use Graphene?
14:47:36 <yolandheroux[m]> Thank you!
14:49:43 <GhostSplinterSix> They are all good. The newer the Pixel, the longer it will be supported.
14:50:04 <yolandheroux[m]> Thank you
14:50:51 <tasanox[m]> Personally I'm hoping the rumors about the Pixel 6 are true. That it will get longer support than 3 measly years
14:51:04 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
14:51:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> They're all good indeed, newer ones are recommended
14:51:35 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <tasanox[m] "Personally I'm hoping the rumors"> That's kinda expected of a Google-made chip, but it will depends how it'll turn out. Nothing is set on stone on longer support yet
14:51:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Would make sense, since its qualcom that limits soc support for 3 years i guess, they want to build their "own" soc in Corporation with samsung
14:52:00 <tasanox[m]> I mean it's Google we're talking about there. Would anyone really be surprised if the support stayed the same? :D
15:12:39 <TheJollyRoger> I would be. For years, Google has been cajoling, pleading, and begging with Qualcomm: "please let us run mainline or stable!" and Qualcomm have refused. Google makes more of their money through advertising and services, and want to set an example using the Pixels. Although it does make them some revenue, they have more of a vested interest in showing off how good Android *can* be with their own
15:12:41 <TheJollyRoger> handsets to generate publicity and good press for the Pixels, than cheaping out and throwing more shovelware handsets onto the market which is already oversaturated and overcompetitive from low-end OEMs.
15:13:04 <TheJollyRoger> So I would be very very surprised if Google did not go for an extra year of support.
15:13:43 <TheJollyRoger> *to generate good publicity and good press using the Pixels, than cheaping out
15:15:31 <TheJollyRoger> So it makes sense from a business standpoint that they would give an extra year. Again, nothing's written in stone and I don't want to metaphorically count the chickens before they hatch, but I'd be surprised.
15:15:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> Has any body some experience to download Threema from Apk
15:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> I think a few people here have. You might get better luck in #grapheneos-offtopic about Threema, I recall a number of people there talking about it.
15:17:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚Äãodolamundo> We‚Äôre can I find it
15:18:20 <TheJollyRoger> I'm actually unsure how to do it via Telegram, but it's #grapheneos-offtopic on IRC and Matrix.org.
15:27:10 <_johnson> GrapheneOS-Teleg FYI, I got both phones switched over to Grapheneos. When I tried again this morning everything worked fine. I greatly appreciate all your time and help yesterday!
15:29:46 <BusterBoy> Hey all, new to Graphene. Does it update OTA ? For example, I have the 5/4/21 release, will it update the next one automatically?
15:32:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Yes
15:33:29 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
15:33:35 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
15:39:41 <BusterBoy> Cool appreciate y'all. I guess even tho it was 'released' on the reddit, it is not official stable channel yet?
15:39:49 <BusterBoy> Thanks for an amazing project...
15:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> BusterBoy: Yes, the beta testers are the second in line (after internal testing) to test and report back in order to make sure nothing's broken, before it goes to Stable.
15:44:42 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has no automatic error reporting or telemetry, so it's entirely reliant on the beta testing community to catch and identify anything that breaks before the images go out to stable.
15:45:47 <TheJollyRoger> *before the OTA update packages go out to stable.
15:54:42 <_johnson> What's a preferred secure messaging app for grapheneos?
15:55:05 <surveillexxxx[m]> briar, signal
15:55:27 <_johnson> okay.
15:55:32 <_johnson> Thanks!
15:59:56 <BusterBoy> _johnson I've been using Signal as my default SMS + Signal app
16:00:20 <BusterBoy> Really the only complaint I have with the Signal app is the CALL button defaults/mandates to a Signal call rather than doing a Voice call...

16:15:34 <alex-resist> Is it ok to try out Android 12 on a supported Pixel and go back to GrapheneOS from there? Or would it be better to flash stock Android 11 as an intermediate step?
16:19:42 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The latter is preferred, historically
16:20:58 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The latter is preferred, rather (though it shouldn't matter too much?)
16:22:29 <lackshan[m]> <bt1[m] "I read it but I didn't understan"> All calls and SMS can be read as they're not encrypted
16:22:35 <alex-resist> Yeah, I would like to know that as well. Also how important is it really to update every Pixel to the latest stock OS before flashing Graphene. Sometimes it takes an hour to update a Pixel, when it's a couple of months behind. But I also don't really want to risk anything

Second, you are free to use any launcher, but you significantly increase your attack surface by doing so, as launchers are apps with special permissions.

20:25:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That's not how it works trttl
20:25:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Launchers require a permission to be a launcher

21:45:53 <curioussoldier> Hi, quick question regarding support of the Pixel 3, 3 XL, 3a and 3a XL. Is the end-of-support date known for these devices?
21:46:26 <aks3n> curioussoldier, https://endoflife.date/pixel
21:47:21 <curioussoldier> Thank you for the quick reply, that answer made me sad :(
21:49:16 <TheJollyRoger> Hi curioussoldier, yeah, the easy way to know when the current bunch of Pixel devices end is to look at the month and year they were released, then add three years to the year they were released. That will give you the end of life date. Some speculation and rumours have circulated that Google may in the far future move to its own chips for the phone and possibly stretch their support by another
21:49:19 <TheJollyRoger> year but those are just rumours at this point.
21:49:25 <aks3n> curioussoldier, also check out https://grapheneos.org/faq#legacy-devices and https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices as well as https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
21:51:16 <TheJollyRoger> *three years to the month that they were released
21:52:28 <curioussoldier> Thank you to both of you, your answers are appreciated! I was about to go buy another Pixel 3 XL, but now knowing support is ending in less than 6 months, I have to reconsider... I will have to look for a 4a instead.
21:52:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, the 4a is currently good value for the money.
21:53:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hope you enjoy GrapheneOS, welcome aboard!
21:54:33 <nebulawn[m]> Hi I have recently found out about Graphene OS and was wondering what a good model would be
21:54:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hello nebulawn[m], what do you mean "a good model?"
21:55:13 <nebulawn[m]> A good Pixel
21:56:06 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to that, the rationale is generally "Buy the newest supported Pixel you can afford." Newer devices are supported for longer (at the present time, it's 3 years from the day they were released), and by nature of having newer chips, often have slightly better security.
21:56:43 <nebulawn[m]> Thank you
21:57:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome! Welcome aboard!
21:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: The easiest way to see which ones are supported is by checking out https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices , which lists the currently supported phones, so be sure to check there, before you put the money down.
22:12:31 <nebulawn[m]> The Adaptive Battery lasts up to 24 hours [1] as it learns your favorite apps and reduces power to the ones you rarely use google admitted it
22:13:16 <strcat[m]> there's documentation available on how power management works
22:13:23 <nebulawn[m]> What image for the 4a should I download
22:13:47 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: The 4a is Sunfish, and the 4a5G is Bramble. Never try to mix them up!
22:14:10 <nebulawn[m]> sunfish-factory-2021.05.04.01.zip
22:14:26 <nebulawn[m]> is this the correct image
22:14:27 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: be very careful. Flashing the 4a image onto a 4a5G, or the other way around, will cause a permanent brick, so you must be sure you get the right one, for the right phone.
22:15:13 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: You should consider installing using the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web .
22:16:12 <TheJollyRoger> It's faster, easier, safer, and just as secure as the commandline method.
22:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> The only advantage to the commandline method is that you get that nebulous "1337 h4X0r" feeling of watching computer-gibberish fly past, little of which means anything if you're not debugging the install process or are a developer.
22:22:11 <nebulawn[m]> is there a video on installaltion
22:25:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> The is no video (you're supposed to be able to read XD)
22:25:23 <strcat[m]> use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:25:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> * There is no video
22:25:26 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: no, there isn't. Most ones on YouTube are misleading and will end you up with a bricked device. Fortunately, the Web Installer is very much "plug your phone in, follow the instructions on the screen, click the button, wait for the progress bar in the popup to finish, then do the same for the next two steps.
22:25:46 <nebulawn[m]> those buttons do stuff
22:25:59 <nebulawn[m]> I clicked them and they did nothing
22:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, when your phone is plugged in. Note that you will need to use Edge, Chromium, Chrome, or a supported browser on a supported OS, while the phone is plugged in.
22:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> Read everything before you begin.
22:26:27 <nebulawn[m]> firefox
22:26:32 <nebulawn[m]> is that supported
22:26:34 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <nebulawn[m] "firefox"> NO
22:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: Mozilla has decided they don't want to support WebUSB, so it never will be.
22:26:59 <nebulawn[m]> so use google chrome
22:27:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> WHAT
22:27:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nebulawn: Mozilla has decided th"> Wait they
22:27:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> What do they have against it?
22:27:10 <TheJollyRoger> Railgun_Lover[m]: I have no idea.
22:27:45 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: yes. Use Google Chrome, Edge, or Chromium.
22:27:45 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <nebulawn[m] "so use google chrome"> Yes, that works
22:28:04 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: read everything on the website before you begin.
22:28:16 <TheJollyRoger> *on the web page of https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:28:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> nebulawn: Please read grapheneos.org/install/web and the instructions
22:28:24 <nebulawn[m]> its ironic that it takes so much google to make a smartphone not google
22:28:24 <TheJollyRoger> It will guide you through the exact process.
22:28:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Everything you're asking is documented there
22:28:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <nebulawn[m] "its ironic that it takes so much"> No, not really
22:28:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If your only goal is avoiding Google you can just use iOS
22:29:07 <nebulawn[m]> thats what im trying to get away from
22:29:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> nebulawn: anyway that's unimportant
22:29:49 <TheJollyRoger> nebulawn[m]: Well, if you think about it... Google is the only smartphone vendor that allows full utilization of all the security features on operating systems that aren't their own. They actually actively support third party operating systems and encourage their development, unlike other Android OEMs that force you to disable security features if you want to run an operating system that isn't
22:29:51 <TheJollyRoger> theirs.
22:30:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Google software is often excellent for privacy, contrary to what people think
22:30:49 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It's mostly their consumer-level goodies that are invasive
22:31:12 <TheJollyRoger> They want their phones to be the standard against which all other Android devices are measured against, so they go the extra mile in ensuring that they work with upstream, their devices are the first to recieve security patches,
22:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> all their drivers are open source, and they even make firmware sources available if you ask nicely.
22:32:46 <M7777777y[m]> On that note do you think open firmware would ever be available for a pixel?
22:32:58 <TheJollyRoger> M7777777y[m]: yes.
22:33:33 <M7777777y[m]> They would be very valuable if that happened
22:33:46 <M7777777y[m]> But I doubt it
22:34:11 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Pretty sure much of the firmware is open source already
22:34:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> That's what I read somewhere, at least
22:34:19 <M7777777y[m]> Why would google allow us to have a phone that's actually good
22:34:46 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Because It isn't some evil Satan-esque demonic hellhole? I'm not sure what you're saying
22:35:13 <TheJollyRoger> Because they want other OEMs to use the android ecosystem and pay them great big fat royalties in order to do so. In order to do that, they have to demonstrate that they've got an ecosystem worth being a part of.
22:35:38 <M7777777y[m]> That's not exactly what I'm saying no, but it wouldn't be too far off either
22:35:50 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Pretty sure much of the firmware"> Oh wait what am I saying, Jolly confirmed it
22:36:32 <M7777777y[m]> Which firmware is not open yet then?
22:36:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <M7777777y[m] "That's not exactly what I'm sayi"> ?
22:36:51 <M7777777y[m]> This is the first I've ever heard of it
22:39:24 <FieryBinary> M7777777y[m]: Titan M is proprietary, but that's negligible
22:40:49 <strcat[m]> FieryBinary: every x86 and ARM SoC is proprietary
22:41:19 <FieryBinary> strcat[m]: Ah that's right
22:42:06 <FieryBinary> I've heard that much Pixel firmware is open source - is the "closedness" in the fact that one can't verify that it's the one running?
22:42:26 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
22:42:33 <strcat[m]> that's not what closed source means
22:43:30 <FieryBinary> I thought the hardware could be based on an open standard, etc. but because it's so complex it's a black box
22:44:17 <strcat[m]> hardware implementing an open standard ISA / APIs can be closed source
22:44:19 <strcat[m]> different things
22:44:29 <FieryBinary> I see, thanks
22:44:35 <strcat[m]> a RISC-V SoC can be and usually is closed source hardware
22:44:53 <strcat[m]> hardware being open source doesn't make it more verifiable
22:45:05 <strcat[m]> and open source != more private or more secure
22:45:07 <strcat[m]> that's not what it means
22:45:11 <strcat[m]> it means open source, that's igt
22:45:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, the biggest adoption of RISC V to this date is in NVIDIA graphics cards to replace the older generation falcon chip. Sure the ISA may be open, but the ISA is a sheet of paper.
22:45:13 <strcat[m]>  * it means open source, that's it
22:45:27 <FieryBinary> Right, was never trying to portray it as more private or secure
22:45:30 <strcat[m]> the ISA is just the API software uses to talk to it
22:45:36 <FieryBinary> Ohhhhhh
22:45:50 <M7777777y[m]> If pixel has some open firmware does graphene actually reflash some of this?
22:45:50 <TheJollyRoger> It's entirely dependent on the goodwill of the manufacturer to make the device auditable, or transparent.
22:46:01 <strcat[m]> 7y: please read docs
22:46:04 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS ships all the firmware
22:46:18 <strcat[m]> has nothing to do with which parts are open or not
22:46:26 <strcat[m]>  * has nothing to do with which parts are open source or not
22:46:27 <Wonderfall[m]> Nice read on RISC-V and what it really means: https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1366631459000258565
22:46:57 <strcat[m]> 7y: we provide full security updates, that includes updating/shipping all the firmware
22:47:02 <strcat[m]> it's a given
22:48:00 <strcat[m]> and again open source means open source, either way you have the code that runs on the hardware and can inspect it because it's not encrypted or anything like Intel CPU firmware
22:48:41 <strcat[m]> source code isn't what you actually run, it's the source code which you compile into the code you run
22:48:52 <strcat[m]> you still have the code that you run and can inspect it for closed source software
22:49:00 <strcat[m]> serious misunderstanding that many people have about it
22:50:08 <M7777777y[m]> Yeah I understand
22:51:11 <M7777777y[m]> Nice
22:51:37 <M7777777y[m]> I thought ALL of the firmware on pixel was closed source
22:53:32 <GhostSplinterSix> ü§î
22:57:40 <strcat[m]> 7y: no, not at all
22:58:36 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier though every ARM and x86 SoC is pretty much entirely closed source (the hardware and low-level firmware)
22:59:48 <assa> any word on how google switching to their own chipset might impact security and likelihood / worthiness of grapheneos support of pixels in the future? or is there not enough information yet
22:59:52 <M7777777y[m]> Well that is the most important part
23:00:08 <strcat[m]> assa: rumours aren't useful information to comment on
23:00:25 <assa> assa: yeah figured thanks
