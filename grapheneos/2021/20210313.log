00:30:18 <Thatcher[m]> <strcat "Thatcher: you're using an app li"> Thanks for that info. Now it all makes sense!
00:31:17 <Kyle> Newbie here I'm getting this error on the web installer on the flash releaser part. "Error: A transfer error has occurred.
00:31:18 <Kyle> "
00:31:36 <strcat> Kyle: read info it has on USB ports/cables
00:31:41 <strcat> you have an unreliable USB connection
00:31:57 <strcat> you need to use a computer, port and cable providing a reliable connection
00:32:07 <strcat> that info is really important and is the #1 cause of issues installing by far
00:33:11 <Kyle> I am using the original c to c in a c slot on my laptop. Should I try a different cable anyways?
00:34:26 <strcat[m]> your laptop's USB port is probably non-spec-compliant/broken
00:34:30 <strcat[m]> try a different port
00:34:40 <strcat[m]> maybe your OS has broken USB support
00:34:48 <strcat[m]> a lot of Linux distributions have broken USB stacks
00:34:52 <Jgem[m]> Kyle: I had issue where even one c slot had error and the other c slot worked
00:34:56 <strcat[m]> especially newer USB standards
00:35:11 <strcat[m]> USB-C ecosystem is full of broken products
00:35:24 <strcat[m]> broken ports, broken hubs (often some ports use internal hubs too), broken cables
00:35:41 <strcat[m]> the cables that come with the phones are great but many USB-C ports and OS implementations of it are broken
00:36:06 <Kyle> it does do a lot of stuff and restart it a bunch but eventually it sits at the unlocked bootloader saying its restarting the device
00:37:07 <strcat[m]> broken USB cable / port
00:39:40 <Kyle> Can i use a usb to c?
00:41:03 <strcat[m]> USB-A to USB-C? sure but most cables for that are broken
00:41:09 <strcat[m]> it's all covered in the guide
00:41:13 <strcat[m]> please read the information on this there
00:44:25 <jcb20> hello..
00:44:54 <jcb20> I am installing Graphene on a pixel 4xl.. WIth the WEB tool.. Stuck at the Flashing Factory Images with this error (Timeout 10000 ms exceeded)  phone is waiting on the Fastbootd screen
00:45:09 <jcb20> any suggestion?
00:45:28 <strcat[m]> jcb20: the information there on USB is important
00:45:36 <strcat[m]> make sure to read what it says about USB in the prerequisites section
00:45:44 <strcat[m]> you have an unreliable USB port / hub / cable
00:45:55 <strcat[m]> it's a hardware issue
00:45:55 <jcb20> i am directly connected to a mac
00:46:05 <strcat[m]> jcb20: with the cable that comes with the phone?
00:46:09 <strcat[m]> jcb20: use a different USB port
00:46:28 <strcat[m]> and use the cable that comes with the phone
00:46:31 <jcb20> ok...
00:46:41 <strcat[m]> also make sure adb isn't running
00:46:42 <jcb20> I have a solid cable...
00:46:49 <strcat[m]> use the cable that comes with the phone
00:46:51 <strcat[m]> not some other cable
00:47:03 <jcb20> its a refurbished phone
00:47:19 <strcat[m]> what makes you say it's a solid cable? have you used testing equipment to verify it's a proper USB-C implementation?
00:47:39 <strcat[m]> jcb20: the issue is the USB cable or port
00:47:46 <strcat[m]> Macbook ports are fine unless damaged
00:47:52 <strcat[m]> so it's almost certainly a cable issue
00:48:03 <jcb20> its an Imac
00:48:07 <strcat[m]> nothing beyond using a working, spec compliant cable will resolve it
00:48:17 <strcat[m]> jcb20: should be fine, issue is the cable in all likelihood
00:48:26 <strcat[m]> nothing can be done to help beyond using a proper cable
00:48:44 <jcb20> i think its a good cable because of its price.. but you are right.. not objective
00:48:57 <strcat[m]> high price doesn't mean good
00:49:10 <strcat[m]> plenty of bad stuff is sold at expensive prices
00:49:31 <jcb20> the original cable was/is worse, was not even able to charge
00:49:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "high price doesn't mean good"> This lol
00:49:45 <jcb20> its refurbished so its not the original cable
00:50:20 <strcat[m]> most USB-C products are non-spec-compliant / broken
00:50:24 <strcat[m]> they take shortcuts / are incompetent
00:50:29 <jcb20> ugreen Cable..
00:50:31 <strcat[m]> just the reality of USB-C
00:50:36 <strcat[m]> jcb20: ugreen isn't a good company
00:50:46 <jcb20> ok.. how can I get a good one?
00:50:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "jcb20: ugreen isn't a good compa"> Thanks for letting me know
00:50:52 <strcat[m]> also a lot of company made bad cables in the past and still have lots of bad inventory
00:50:52 <jcb20> where?
00:51:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> I was almost going to get one of their
00:51:03 <strcat[m]> jcb20: Apple ones are fine, Google ones are fine, Anker is fine
00:51:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> * I was almost going to get one of theirs
00:51:12 <jcb20> ok
00:51:12 <strcat[m]> jcb20: I would return that cable
00:51:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw have had decent experience with OnePlus cables
00:51:25 <strcat[m]> jcb20: it's possible it's the USB port that's broken
00:51:31 <strcat[m]> jcb20: try another USB port if you have others
00:51:32 <jcb20> it was fine for its other tasks.. :)
00:51:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> But watch out, they are usb2
00:51:37 <strcat[m]> jcb20: also it's possible only half the cable is broken
00:51:40 <strcat[m]> jcb20: that's normal
00:51:45 <jcb20> yes.. will try other ports..
00:51:47 <strcat[m]> jcb20: so try a diff USB port
00:51:47 <jcb20> have 4
00:51:54 <strcat[m]> and try plugging in the cable the other orientation
00:52:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw entirely possible the port on the motherboard is broken
00:52:12 <strcat[m]> USB-C cables are 2 ways they can be plugged in and it's not just connected physically to the same thing
00:52:23 <strcat[m]>  * USB-C cables have 2 ways they can be plugged in and it's not just connected physically to the same thing
00:52:35 <strcat[m]> a lot of bad USB-C products have one orientation partially/totally broken
00:52:39 <strcat[m]> due to cutting corners
00:52:51 <strcat[m]> you can try flipping it on both ends
00:52:54 <strcat[m]> because both ends are different
00:53:10 <strcat[m]> a lot of companies make broken trash
00:53:10 <jcb20> but if its broken it would not be able to send the instructions and I would not be this far.. No?
00:53:21 <strcat[m]> jcb20: it's definitely a USB connection issue
00:53:33 <strcat[m]> jcb20: if you had another kind of issue you wouldn't be able to unlock and start flashing
00:53:38 <jcb20> cannot flip.. on the mac its not USB C..
00:53:41 <jcb20> old machine
00:53:42 <strcat[m]> the connection is dropping or not being picked up again
00:53:55 <strcat[m]> jcb20: ah well, it's almost certainly the cable then
00:54:00 <strcat[m]> jcb20: so try flipping it on the phone end
00:54:12 <strcat[m]> > 50% of USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
00:54:17 <jcb20> ok
00:54:19 <strcat[m]>  * at least 50% of USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
00:54:26 <strcat[m]> the issue is less bad for USB-C to USB-C cables
00:54:30 <jcb20> will try that after the ports
00:54:34 <strcat[m]> but still a lot of them are broken products
00:54:56 <strcat[m]> jcb20: it has to transfer gigabytes of data reliably
00:55:02 <strcat[m]> and reconnect reliably at various points
00:55:05 <jcb20> yes.. all the image
00:55:07 <strcat[m]> so the cable really has to work 100%
00:55:19 <strcat[m]> a lot of cables are broken and you wouldn't notice in most cases
00:55:23 <strcat[m]> but for flashing you will
00:55:30 <jcb20> ok
00:55:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw if it just doesn't work
00:55:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pm me
00:55:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have workarounds for broken cables
00:55:58 <jcb20> thanks a lot
00:56:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't share them publicly though
00:56:22 <jcb20> ok.. just flipped the side on the phone
00:56:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because if you have a broken cable
00:56:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> No software workaround is 100% going to work
00:56:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Keep that in mind
00:57:05 <jcb20> agree.
00:57:31 <jcb20> if the cable works. does it take a long time?
00:57:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it is taking a very long time
00:57:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like more than 10 minutes
00:58:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Looking at a cable/port/driver issue
00:58:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Could also mean that you're installing from a VM and VM runs at like usb 1.1 speeds
00:58:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't know what you're doing so good luck
00:58:40 <jcb20> i am using the installer from the web interface
00:59:08 <jcb20> but looks like no matter where i run it from, the USB issue is the same

01:21:10 <grapheneos_user_> <greenfield12[m] "image.png"> Web installer is recommended, but if you must use CLI: just use .\fastboot
01:21:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> grapheneos_user_pi: no

01:21:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tell them they forgot to set the path correctly
01:22:29 <grapheneos_user_> greenfield12: grapheneos.org/install also you didn't set the path correctly
01:23:11 <grapheneos_user_> greenfield12: Disregard what I said before
01:23:58 <greenfield12[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "greenfield12: Disregard what I s"> i tried to follow the guide as close as possible and do not know my mistake.
01:24:04 <greenfield12[m]> which path should it be?
01:25:29 <grapheneos_user_> greenfield12: You should use the web install

01:34:42 <grapheneos_user_> greenfield12: That could be a bad port or cable
01:35:52 <grapheneos_user_> Are you plugging it in directly into the port, rather than using a hub or front panel USB?
01:36:33 <greenfield12[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "Are you plugging it in directly "> yes directly into the motherboard
01:36:57 <grapheneos_user_> <greenfield12[m] "yes directly into the motherboar"> Yeah then it's probably a bad port/cable
01:36:59 <greenfield12[m]> and i also was able to unlock the bootloader before
01:37:09 <greenfield12[m]> additionally i see the phone in the directory of "this pc"
01:37:28 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: do you see the phone, or Android bootloader interface?
01:37:46 <TheJollyRoger> Because if you see the phone, you are doing it incorrectly.
01:37:49 * greenfield12[m] uploaded an image: (3KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/otxveOpfFHZzeGLKLSPRBhCy/image.png >
01:38:16 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: reboot to fastboot and try again.
01:38:23 <TheJollyRoger> The phone is on, not in bootloader.
01:38:31 <TheJollyRoger> If it's not in bootloader, you can't talk to the bootloader.
01:38:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I have heard somebody say I should not use Debian for flashing GOS.Why is that?
01:39:02 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: Please switch your phone off. Once it's off, I want you to hold the VOLUMEDOWN and POWER keys simultaneously until it brings you to the fastboot screen, then try flashing.
01:39:23 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - Debian's version of fastboot will leave you with an unbootable device.
01:39:55 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - Many people are not aware of that, and obtain the Debian package of fastboot, then wonder why it bricked their device.
01:40:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Will Ubuntu do better?
01:40:36 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - most of the time when this happens, it's not permanent, it just flashes the wrong slot and leaves the device unbootable, but this is reversible. Nevertheless, for many people this can be an extremely nasty scare.
01:40:42 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles Windows does it best.
01:41:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Shit. I would hate to get Windows 10.Though my earlier question was not replied. Would Ubuntu do any better?
01:42:07 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles No, but if you follow the official instructions, or use the WebUI with Chrome, that's best on either.
01:42:09 <greenfield12[m]> <TheJollyRoger "greenfield12: do you see the pho"> i can also see it here
01:42:10 * greenfield12[m] uploaded an image: (2KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uJPIrZbohOzTodkVApguSINz/image.png >
01:42:25 <grapheneos_user_> greenfield12: DO NOT USE ADB
01:42:25 <greenfield12[m]> with its serial number
01:42:52 <grapheneos_user_> Sorry for the caps lock but adb is not used during installation
01:42:55 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: yes, I know. Please do as I say and reboot your phone to fastboot.
01:43:05 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: fastboot CANNOT talk to android while the bootloader is not running.
01:43:50 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: fastboot talks to the bootloader interface, BEFORE the operating system is running, and is useless once the operating system has booted. Android Debug Bridge talks to Android while the operating system is running, AFTER the phone has passed the bootloader.
01:43:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> So if I use Debian + Chrome, I will not get the device bricked?I was not going to do it with CLI. I have a lot of money to lose, so I will use Web Install.
01:44:27 <greenfield12[m]> <TheJollyRoger "greenfield12: fastboot talks to "> nice got it ;)
01:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles If you use debian + chrome, you will not brick the device. If you use third-party versions of fastboot, don't follow the official instructions, and use third party guides, you may brick.
01:45:02 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: Please unplug your phone, reboot your phone to fastboot, and plug it back in.
01:45:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Perfect.Would do anything to not get the device bricked.Thank you.
01:45:42 <greenfield12[m]> <TheJollyRoger "greenfield12: Please unplug your"> i did. it is downloading the factory image
01:45:56 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: Great.
01:46:19 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - yep, and follow the instructions exactly. Read everything before you begin, and take note of any fine details that the instructions may mention.
01:46:30 <TheJollyRoger> If it tells you not to use Incognito mode, don't use Incognito mode.
01:46:46 <TheJollyRoger> (This won't cause a brick, but it will cause the flashing to fail with "error unknown" halfway through)
01:47:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Aye, will keep in mind.
01:48:22 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - most people causing bricks are people who follow dangerous YouTube guides which encourage use of dangerous and obsolete thirdparty software, messing with system variables, and disabling security checks.
01:49:03 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - the process is simple, follow the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/install/web to the letter. If it says that your device should be on fastboot, then your device should be on fastboot.
01:50:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I have heard in this group to definitely not follow YouTube guides due to the risk of being outdated.
01:51:42 <greenfield12[m]> is it possible to get back to andoroid if i might not like graphene after this step:
01:51:43 * greenfield12[m] uploaded an image: (33KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/GepGbgSOtdnTtzqqTdmPKeBw/image.png >
01:51:58 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles Some of them are extremely questionable: one of them even recommended editing out an important safety check in the installation script that prevents the process from going forward if it detects you're about to brick.
01:52:25 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: You can go back to factory Android at any time you wish.
01:53:10 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: that button is only used to distrust and remove GrapheneOS' Verified Boot keys from the secure element if you want to go back to the way your phone used to be when it came from the factory.
01:53:22 <TheJollyRoger> So don't touch it if you want to run GrapheneOS.
01:54:19 <greenfield12[m]> ahh ok
01:56:18 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: If you wanted to go back to the Google OS, what you would do would be to first unlock the bootloader, then click that button, and then go to flash.android.com and use Google's web flashing tool to finish it and then lock the bootloader again.
01:56:29 <TheJollyRoger> That will return your phone back to the way it came.
01:58:15 <greenfield12[m]> great thanks
01:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're welcome!
01:58:28 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship.
01:58:39 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: Make sure you lock the bootloader after installation finishes.
01:58:45 <greenfield12[m]> last step veryfing :) let me check i have problems :)
01:58:47 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise the installation process is incomplete.
01:58:50 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> You can optionally set OEM unlocking back to off by going back to developer options (you'll need to reenable them), switching OEM unlocking to "Off", and then switching off developer options.
01:59:44 <greenfield12[m]> yes i set everything off
01:59:48 <TheJollyRoger> This will make it so that if someone wants to get at that switch a second time, they must either have your password, or must boot your device to recovery and issue a factory reset from recovery in order to get at that switch again.
01:59:51 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:59:51 <greenfield12[m]> usb debugging oem unlocking and ...
02:01:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Oh boy. What a prat.
02:02:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Soooo... can the recovery mode be accesed easily?
02:02:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> No password, no nothing?
02:03:36 <greenfield12[m]> ah verification was very quick
02:03:39 <greenfield12[m]> thats it?
02:03:55 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles Recovery can be accessed without a password and given a VALIDLY SIGNED UPDATE, but the phone cannot be unlocked nor modified without the password.
02:04:14 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles it's really not a problem.
02:04:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Good enough.
02:06:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If it wasn't for recovery, and you forgot your password, your phone's essentially a brick that can light up.
02:08:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Boy does it feel weird to wait for things.I do not have a Google Pixel yet and I am acting like I have it on my hand ready to flash.Pretty daft, ain't it.Anyway, I just hope GPixels have an USB-C to USB-A (the ones mid-age desktop computers have) adapter.
02:08:35 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, they don't. They only come with USB C to USB C.
02:09:01 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, you could buy an Anker or Aukey USB 3.2 Gen 2 USB C to USB A cable.
02:09:47 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles, I would recommend those two. Cheaping out on USB cables may result in you getting a cable that only does File Transfer and charging, but is lacking the traces needed for to fastboot to access the interfaces on the Pixel to install the operating system.
02:09:51 <TheJollyRoger> At best.
02:10:18 <TheJollyRoger> At worst, a cheap cable could fray, then short your phone and kill the phone's battery.
02:10:49 <grapheneos_user_> One should make sure the cable is actually good though, regardless of the price.
02:11:16 <grapheneos_user_> Something being expensive doesn't mean it's good, so expensive cables could still be bad.
02:12:01 <TheJollyRoger> Replacing the battery on a Pixel is almost as expensive as a new device, so it's better to get ripped off buying an overpriced Anker cable with no more value than the pretty blue nylon sheath and the sticker on the box, than having to head on down to drop roughly $350 at UBreakIFix to replace the battery.
02:12:15 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: Oh yeah, true, well said!
02:13:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Heh heh... I do not know what manufacturer is that...Probably something that has been rarely brought over to Venezuela.Dad is definitely not going to buy me that, he will get really mad at me instead.Either I attempt to get the work done by using a chinese adapter and pray it works, or get the job done by using this smartphone which will obviously be in vane because it is not officially supported.Hopefully it ends up be
02:13:48 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles could you repost everything past "ends up be--" it got cut off there?
02:14:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Hopefully it ends up being a fluke and everything goes well.
02:14:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Will search it up on MercadoLibre.
02:14:45 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - before trying to use an adapter, maybe try asking around to find out if anyone you know has a laptop with a USB C port.
02:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> As long as you can view the attestation on a computer you trust, each installation of GrapheneOS is bitwise identical, signed and verified.
02:15:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Well, the only computer I know that has an USB-C port is the GPD-Win, heh heh.
02:15:40 <TheJollyRoger> And you can use attestation.app to make sure that the installing computer didn't say, give you a rogue key that signed a backdoored version of the operating system.
02:15:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> And I sure do not have the GPD-Win.
02:15:55 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Replacing the battery on a Pixel"> Damn I thought the price was $100 or so?
02:15:58 <TheJollyRoger> So the security/privacy of the computer doing the installation is actually a nonissue.
02:16:14 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: it depends on where you go. Here in Canada, UBreakIFix will often really gouge you on parts.
02:16:28 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "grapheneos_user_pi: it depends o"> Ah that makes sense.
02:16:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I have always wondered if I can do the auditing without a secondary device.
02:16:46 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles yes, you can. You use https://attestation.app
02:16:54 <TheJollyRoger> You will need an E-mail address and a password.
02:16:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Thanks!
02:17:09 <TheJollyRoger> Don't lose your password, it can't be reset.
02:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> So if you lose your password you're essentially going to be locked out of your own attestation data.
02:17:43 <TheJollyRoger> And your attestation settings.
02:18:02 <greenfield12[m]> i have a further question. when i download paypal or microsoft one note via the auora store is there anything to care about?
02:18:09 <greenfield12[m]> is this even good to do or either not ?
02:18:22 <TheJollyRoger> You must have internet on your phone to do remote pairing with attestationserver.
02:18:47 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: Nothing to worry about, however take note that some apps that are hard-coded to be dependent on Google may malfunction without it.
02:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> This malfunction could range to the app simply refusing to run and delivering an error saying "Google Play Services are not present on your phone! Goodbye!" when you try to launch the app, crashing when the app tries to function, or not displaying notifications until you open the app in the foreground.
02:19:43 <greenfield12[m]> ok and do i see if thoose apps gather data of myself?
02:20:12 <greenfield12[m]> for example if i download facebook (which i will not do :D)
02:20:21 <sjsndnjdejd> Lol
02:20:35 <TheJollyRoger> greenfield12[m]: apps on Android, and indeed, on GrapheneOS are fully sandboxed, they only see what apps you give them permission to have. Whether they exfiltrate that data regularly to a third-party, or a first-party, is up to the individual app authors to decide.
02:20:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Gottem'.https://tinyurl.com/ygvhvdgoEasy buy.
02:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> Even if they include Firebase or other proprietary libraries, it's up to the app authors to use the functionality provided by those libraries.
02:21:42 <greenfield12[m]> who is the app author? I?
02:21:54 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, the app author is the person who wrote and compiled the app, then published it.
02:22:01 <TheJollyRoger> In that case, it's Facebook.
02:22:55 <TheJollyRoger> In the case of the Facebook app, it's Facebook.
02:23:29 <greenfield12[m]> ok
02:23:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Do you know of any high-quality magnet smartphone to USB-A cord?
02:23:44 <greenfield12[m]> but when i install facebook in this device i also have data loss
02:26:16 <rawtaz> hm. both install methods documentation says that macOS Big Sur is supported. if im on Mojave, am i out of luck or does it work equally fine to install grapheneos on a phone?
02:31:51 <rawtaz> im not seeing any steps in the install instructions that strikes me as needing Big Sur, looks like you basically just need fastboot and the images

06:58:26 <tryptaminegod[m]> Hey, after flashing GraphenrOS I was unable yo re-lock the bootloader. Any ideas for fixes? OEM unlocking is toggled on and greyed out if that's relevant
07:00:53 <strcat> tryptaminegod[m]: you're supposed to lock it in fastboot mode
07:00:59 <strcat> tryptaminegod[m]: installation isn't complete until you do that
07:01:06 <strcat> tryptaminegod[m]: boot back into fastboot mode and lock
07:01:30 <strcat> tryptaminegod[m]: you shouldn't use it in an unlocked state, installation isn't complete and locking it to complete it will wipe data
07:02:05 <strcat> tryptaminegod[m]: you're not giving any details on what makes you 'unable' to do it, I suggest just following the instructions and locking it
07:03:08 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat "tryptamine.god: you're supposed "> Oh OK I believe I already have it in fastboot mode, yeah I followed the installation guide with no luck
07:06:13 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you don't, based on what you said about OEM unlocking toggle
07:06:26 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you've deviated from the instructions
07:06:38 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you followed which installation guide?
07:06:57 <strcat[m]> you're not supposed to boot the OS before you've finished installing, which includes locking
07:08:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-factory-images immediately after flashing you should lock
07:09:09 <strcat[m]>  * tryptamine.god: you aren't, based on what you said about OEM unlocking toggle
07:10:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw I'm most likely going to be the pixel 5 maintainer soon
07:11:16 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you need to explain what you mean by being 'unable' to do it
07:11:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> So yeah 2 devices now here
07:11:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> We could use more volunteers btw
07:11:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pm me, more device maintainers is always a good thing
07:11:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Testers too
07:12:11 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: it gives an error? if so, what error?
07:41:23 <battlepad[m]> hey lads, does seedvault support backing data up to a NAS network share?
07:41:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> You know
07:41:53 <battlepad[m]> like connecting directly to a network share
07:42:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Just backup to internal storage
07:42:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Move the thing to your NAS
07:42:30 <battlepad[m]> ah ic, that works as well
07:48:06 <strcat[m]> battlepad: it supports storage providers
07:48:19 <strcat[m]> so it can backup directly to a storage provider supporting that
08:02:37 <battlepad[m]> i backed up the data to the device
08:02:57 <battlepad[m]> what is the directory that seedvault puts the backups in?

08:19:13 <akc3n[m]> battlepad :
08:19:14 <akc3n[m]> > Are you showing hidden files/folders when you are looking for the backup?
08:19:14 <akc3n[m]> You should find the .SeedVaultAndroidBackup directory in the location you set for the backup.
10:57:58 <kradav[m]> is anyone else experiencing wifi dropouts on 4a?
11:02:32 <tencarsb[m]> I can't find this topic by searching: in order to force to kill an APP, long-press back button, I cannot find it in the system developers setting. Any clues?!
11:09:01 <Arnob[m]> Hello, I am new to GrapheneOS, I plan to switch to GrapheneOS as my current phone isn't supported by LineageOS anymore. Can I use F-Droid on it? Which Pixel phone will have the longest support? Thank you.
11:10:59 <kradav[m]> im using fdroid on it right now, just fine. afaik, support depends on end-of-life support set by google as vendor of pixel phones
11:11:00 <strcat> Arnob[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
11:12:39 <Arnob[m]> strcat: Thank you.
11:18:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Pixel 5 or pixel 4a 5g, the latter has a minimum update support until october 2023 and the former september 2023
11:23:07 <tencarsb[m]> Trying again, force to quit an APP, used to be in the developer settings. Is it gone in graphene OS?
11:24:08 <strcat> tencarsb[m]: force stop is in the normal UI
11:24:16 <strcat> and it's not simply 'force quit'
11:24:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> So when google end active development on a specific device, so does Graphene? I didn't know that, cool.
11:24:35 <strcat> it removes all their jobs, alarms, etc. and puts them in the STOPPED state so they can't start automatically again until started by the user / another app
11:25:02 <tencarsb[m]> <strcat "it removes all their jobs, alarm"> Thank you!
11:25:06 <strcat> when a security no longer has full security updates, GrapheneOS ends official supports and will only do extended support releases
11:25:12 <strcat> you can see that in the FAQ and on the releases page
11:25:27 <strcat> Pixel 2 hasn't had full security updates available since October 2020
11:25:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Extended support meaning just cooking in the latest Android security patches, no features changes etc correct?
11:26:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> That's totally fine... One has to assume that a phone is stable after 2 years of official development. from there on security patches is just fine
11:26:49 <strcat[m]> no that's not what it means
11:27:23 <strcat[m]> the extended support releases are based on the official releases
11:27:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Gotcha, so Graphene on Pixel 2 for example is still on 2020 security ver?
11:27:35 <strcat[m]> they simply add back support for the device and set the security level appropriately
11:28:10 <strcat[m]> any OS on the Pixel 2 is at most 2020-11-01 patch level
11:28:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> i see, and Graphene keeps it at that you say.
11:28:32 <strcat[m]> of course it's just a string and nothing stops an OS from lying about the patch level which most alternate OSes do
11:28:58 <strcat[m]> that's the final obtainable patch level
11:29:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> So if I want to stay most secure, say I prepare a phone for a journalist in Syria, I want him on the latest Pixel every year correct?
11:29:51 <strcat[m]> yes but they get at least 3 years of security updates from launch
11:29:59 <strcat[m]> you don't need to replace it yearly to get security updates
11:30:08 <strcat[m]> but there are yearly security improvements in hardware/firmware
11:30:19 <strcat[m]> and device support code in software too
11:30:22 <strcat[m]> that's a separate topic
11:30:29 <strcat[m]> you may not have intended to but you changed the topic
11:30:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Got it. Superb. So I shall keep this Telegram coomunity and just update here whenever new stuff comes along
11:31:04 <strcat> so for example Pixel 3 added substantial kernel mitigations, other firmware/hardware security improvements
11:31:31 <strcat> including moving from the limited NXP security chip on the Pixel 2 to the more secure and more useful Titan M on the Pixel 3
11:32:01 <strcat> so there are generational improvements in hardware/firmware/software
11:32:13 <strcat> and then separately from that devices are eventually end-of-life/unsupported
11:32:26 <strcat> and GrapheneOS is honest with users about whether a device still has full security updates available
11:33:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Right, that's pretty neat I like that. So 3 is still supported I see but not for much longer.
11:33:05 <strcat> and part of that is we declare it as no longer officially supported and switch to only doing extended support releases since the security patch level needs to be lowered to what it provides and support needs to be added back for the device
11:33:14 <strcat> Pixel 3 is still officially supported
11:33:24 <strcat> after October 2021, the guaranteed support is over
11:33:42 <strcat> so at least within a couple months, it will likely no longer be officially supported, and will only get our extended support releases
11:34:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> After support is over, one can still use the ROM just the security will start declining from there on, correct?
11:34:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> yes
11:35:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Very nice. Well, let's hope you find a factory and make your own Graphene hardwware lineup
11:35:26 <strcat> Pixel 2 is insecure (regardless of what you run on it)
11:35:34 <strcat> we still do extended support releases for it
11:35:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> I'd rather pay Graphene than Google for hardware
11:35:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> we will soon
11:36:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> By the way, hardware wise, Pixel 3 and Pixel 5 have the exact same Titan circuitry?
11:36:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> or did they improve the chip rev for 5
11:37:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> I can already tell you that a premade Graphene phone with OTA servers will be like hot buns in my company
11:42:47 <hungrybungry[m]> Im currently waiting for my phone to get to my house. Is there any specific client that is preferred for this chat?
11:42:58 <hungrybungry[m]> Im on iOS if that matters
11:45:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> @hungrybungry i use Telegram which is connected by team via Bridge IRC/ Matrix
11:49:36 <hungrybungry[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<NorwegianFrost> @hungrybungry i"> The graphene subreddit recommended riot.im which became element
12:08:43 <Duxy[m]> I use Element
12:09:06 <Duxy[m]> Never tried anything else though
12:09:21 <Duxy[m]> * Never tried anything else tho
12:19:49 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat[m] "you're not supposed to boot the "> Used the  install page on the grapheneos site. Firstly, I could not get past the "flash.all" segment of the install, my command window just closed. Tried dozens of fixes. So, I ended up using the online usbbased installation also on the official Grapheneos site. I was able to flash the image that way but was stuck at locking bootloader. Other than that the phone
12:19:50 <tryptaminegod[m]> works fine. It was a couple weeks ago so don't remember the error msg. Just backed up and will reinstall tomorrow. So you're saying it must be in fastboot mode, and locked using adb command fastboot flashing lock?
12:21:01 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you weren't following the guide
12:21:09 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: the guide never says to open that file
12:21:16 <strcat[m]> so you clearly weren't following it from the start
12:21:38 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: the mistake you made is using inaccurate unofficial guides, and in doing so you took major security risks among others
12:22:17 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: adb is not used by the official CLI install guide and there's certainly nowhere that it has you open anything in the system file manager
12:22:22 <strcat[m]> it definitely doesn't have you open flash-all.bat
12:22:34 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you weren't following it, and therefore, you didn't get a completed/working install
12:23:01 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: our recommendation (which is on the site) for most users is to use https://grapheneos.org/install/web and the CLI install guide is for people experienced with CLI
12:23:24 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/ is the initial install landing page and says web install is recommended
12:23:38 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli also mentions the web installer
12:23:50 <strcat[m]> and it certainly doesn't say to do the things you're talking about
12:24:10 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use adb at all, doesn't use system file manager, doesn't ever tell you to open flash-all.bat (which is wrong to do)
12:24:14 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/install/ "> After failing with my initial install i used the web based, still couldnt lock bootloaaderI
12:24:28 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you followed unofficial guides first
12:24:38 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: so, you messed up the computer and the phone
12:24:54 <strcat[m]> the installation isn't going to work if you launched adb and have it running in the background
12:25:20 <strcat[m]> really important to follow the official guides and not misguided/inaccurate unofficial ones
12:25:38 <strcat[m]> it explains everything that went wrong for you: the connection not being picked up again, etc.
12:25:42 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat[m] "tryptamine.god: so, you messed u"> My computer is fine. How do I fix it? Reinstall with web based installation?
12:25:51 <strcat[m]> no, it's not fine
12:25:56 <strcat[m]> you messed it up following the unofficial guide
12:26:03 <strcat[m]> that's why it wasn't working for the web installer
12:26:12 <strcat[m]>  * you messed it up following some unofficial guide
12:28:38 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat[m] "that's why it wasn't working for"> My computer is fine. Using adb tools may have caused the error on my phone but it was not making any changes to the PC. I'm not here to argue, how do I fix this?
12:29:14 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: sounds like you're here to argue and that initial post for this conversation said you followed the official CLI guide when you didn't
12:29:27 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: you don't want to listen, so there's not much more to be said
12:31:30 <billinmtl[m]>  I've only used the CLI install option ( a few times now as I went back and forth with stock OS ) .  On my first attempt, I misread the instructions as to what terminal to open on Windows 10.  I opened the terminal app - instead of the windows powershell terminal which ended with numerous errors and a failed install.  Since catching my initial mistake and only using the windows powershell terminal - I've had zero
12:31:30 <billinmtl[m]> issues, as noted - with numerous installs
12:31:57 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat[m] "tryptamine.god: you don't want t"> The only differences in opinion regards the functionality of my PC which only I am the judge of.. I'm simply asking how to fix my errors.
12:32:42 <strcat[m]> as I said, you messed up the computer with following unofficial guides
12:32:58 <strcat[m]> my suggestion is to do the install from a computer where you haven't done who knows what based on unofficial videos, etc.
12:33:31 <strcat[m]> you're talking about using adb and opening flash-all.bat so it's really clear that you were NOT following the official guide
12:33:48 <tryptaminegod[m]> <billinmtl[m] " I've only used the CLI install "> Ahh, that makes sense - I was using cmd. But the web based is the route I'll take as a noon, if I can.
12:34:05 <strcat[m]> tryptamine.god: no, it doesn't explain it
12:34:12 <strcat[m]> you already admitted above to clearly not following the official guide
12:34:23 <strcat[m]> I'm well aware of what you did and why everything went wrong
12:36:45 <tryptaminegod[m]> <strcat[m] "I'm well aware of what you did a"> Oh my god you're aware! What am I to do? Find help from someone who isn't a rude and unhelpful as yourself. You seem to be taking this personally. Any ELSE have any ideas?
12:37:52 <strcat[m]> don't see the point in someone asking for help that's not going to be honest and doesn't want to listen to advice
12:38:08 <strcat[m]> waste of everyone's time/effort
12:39:01 <billinmtl[m]> I will delete my reply above
12:42:01 <strcat[m]> and I do take it really personally that someone gets a substantial amount of my time to help and is unwilling to listen or to be honest so they were right about that
12:42:38 <strcat[m]> they asked for help yesterday, they got help, and didn't listen
12:50:48 <stripperscokenos> <strcat[m] "they asked for help yesterday, t"> Uhh hi I'm new here. Please don't ban me but the dude just seemed like he was looking for help, he kept on asking and only disagreed that his comp wasn't wrecked lol. Are you Dan Micray by chance?

13:01:17 <strcat[m]> I spent a bunch of time helping him
13:01:25 <strcat[m]> I helped previously, this was his response to my previous help
13:01:30 <strcat[m]> yesterday
13:01:51 <strcat[m]> wouldn't listen, and was determined to pretend they'd only followed the official guide when it clearly wasn't true
13:02:08 <strcat[m]> don't see the point in that
13:02:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Anyways, it's here: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210313#c7240809
13:03:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Breaks rule #0
13:09:29 <hungrybungry[m]> Dude had to be a troll
13:11:39 <strcat[m]> btw the 2nd one contacted me and admitted they are just going to ban evade (presumably same person anyway)
13:12:34 <rawtaz> i havent been following, but there's only one thing that should be done when someone is trolling or misbehaving excessively: everyone just ignore them. problem solved, and that is the ONLY approach that actually works on people like that. they will evade everything else.
13:12:51 <strcat[m]> does anyway really believe that the 2nd person to join with the same style of name, etc. was disconnected from the 1st?
13:13:09 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: well the issue is they originally weren't trolling, just being incredibly disrespectful of the substantial time spent trying to help them
13:13:22 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: and going out of the way to be dishonest about what had happened for no explicable reason
13:13:40 <strcat[m]> thought they were just remembering wrong / making a mistake but they made it really clear it was intentionally
13:14:05 <strcat[m]> this is continued from yesterday, for context
13:15:12 <strcat[m]> they asked for help yesterday, wouldn't really answer the questions that were asked to try to help, got a lot of information/advice regardless, then replied today with a length message disregarding that and presenting a clearly inaccurate story (which I interpreted as a mistake / bad recollection of what happened, until they flat out admitted it wasn't)
13:15:31 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: maybe they were just trolling the whole time
13:15:46 <strcat[m]> intending to waste people's time
13:16:27 <strcat[m]> I don't really think that's what happened
13:18:26 <strcat[m]> I think they really did want help but weren't willing to answer the questions and read/listen
13:19:11 <strcat[m]> and didn't want to admit that the reason it went wrong is they followed an unofficial guide even though knowing that is pretty important to providing the right help
13:19:29 <strcat[m]> I know what went wrong: they had adb daemon running
13:19:50 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: i hear you. i see that pretty much every day or so. people just being idiots. but the ignore thing applies to them too, even if they are trolling unknowingly :D
13:19:53 <strcat[m]> tried to tell them that they'd screwed up the computer they were installing from doing that stuff
13:20:00 <strcat[m]> didn't want to listen
13:20:23 <rawtaz> i think youre right. people are just too dumb to have any common sense or to have any logical thinking or to realize that if they want help they should answer questions theyre being asked, etc.
13:20:40 <rawtaz> anyway, best is to just ignore them, there's really no other way, tehy cant be talked sense into
13:20:50 <rawtaz> time for a walk outside :)
13:21:52 * rawtaz &
14:11:15 <lavonni[m]> hey no pressure if you don't already have them publicly accessible. is there a financial report on what donations are used for?
14:11:34 <lavonni[m]> of course if there isn't, I'm not asking you to make one
14:14:18 <rny> i can go on record to say that i got a pixel3a for dev purposes.
14:17:26 <hungrybungry[m]> How does one go about starting learning dev shit, specific to this project
14:28:04 <pizzaeater69[m]> I think people start by learning the simple stuff like HTML and javascript, memory stuff etc  and after year(s) of that they might be able to help. But I dont think people start learning how to make Grapheneos better because starting with that is too complex
14:29:24 <strcat[m]> there isn't a high barrier to entry to contributing because there are a bunch of standalone projects to work on
14:29:35 <strcat[m]> and even working on the OS itself there is a ton of stuff to work on, a lot of it is simple
14:29:38 <strcat[m]> and in a bunch of languages
14:30:29 <rny> find something you wanna add/fix
14:30:57 <hungrybungry[m]> I know that ive briefly looked over a list of stuff that was being requested for graphene, but it was all way above my understanding
14:31:31 <hungrybungry[m]> Also months ago. I do some programming, but it doesn’t translate to anything outside work lol
14:38:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Is wireless flashing support being planned for WebInstall?
14:39:09 <strcat[m]> no? that's not possible
14:39:23 <nscnt[m]> WebUSB -- wireless ?
15:06:10 <Real[m]> Hey
15:18:25 <Real[m]> Many apps are asking for sensor permission
15:18:35 <Real[m]> Whys that?
15:19:39 <Real[m]> And one wireless emergency alerts app has both phone and SMS permissions which cant be changed.
15:19:54 <Real[m]> On graphene
15:20:30 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://grapheneos.org/usage#bugs-uncovered-by-security-features
15:20:30 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> 2nd paragraph
15:20:56 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Real[m] "Many apps are asking for sensor "> Oh, the one on settings? For compatibility reasons, every single app includes OTHER_SENSORS permission, and is enabled by default
15:20:57 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Real[m] "And one wireless emergency alert"> as the repo of this app is not forked on GrapheneOS, it is the default configuration as is on AOSP
15:21:01 <Real[m]> Alright thanks
16:12:35 <strcat[m]> Real: Network and Sensors are added by GrapheneOS
16:12:54 <strcat[m]> Real: that's why those are enabled by default, rather than requested at runtime by apps, because apps aren't written specifically for GrapheneOS
16:13:17 <strcat[m]> Real: apps declare if they need network access so the permission only appears for apps that actually say they need it
16:13:29 <strcat[m]> Real: that's not the case for sensors, apps don't declare if they need that for standard Android
16:13:37 <strcat[m]> so, therefore, GrapheneOS has to assume EVERY app needs sensors
16:13:51 <strcat[m]> in the future we can special case system apps and manually add the permission to all apps that actually need it
16:14:17 <strcat[m]> Real: also, you're really wasting your time and likely screwing things up by messing with core OS component permissions
16:14:32 <strcat[m]> Real: those things are part of the base OS
16:14:58 <strcat[m]> Real: strongly recommend only changing things for user-facing apps (don't toggle on showing system apps, which are base OS components)
16:24:51 <Duxy[m]> I enabled the "Sensors Off" option in Developer Options.
16:26:31 <mrsenshi[m]> Is there a "Best Practices" page or anything of the sort? I've got unmodified GrapheneOS, the bootloader is locked, I disabled OEM unlocking to enable full device protection, I used the auditor app to verify everything, I've setup user accounts and won't use the admin account.
16:26:31 <mrsenshi[m]> Anything else I should look out for?
16:26:44 <mrsenshi[m]> * Is there a "Best Practices" page or anything of the sort? I've got unmodified GrapheneOS, the bootloader is locked, I disabled OEM unlocking to enable full device protections, I used the auditor app to verify everything, I've setup user accounts and won't use the admin account.
16:26:45 <mrsenshi[m]> Anything else I should look out for?
16:28:39 <strcat[m]> using the owner account isn't a problem
16:28:39 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: don't do that. That's not going to get you any more security, and in fact having developer options on and futzing with developer options is likely to get you significantly less.
16:28:50 <strcat[m]> think you misunderstand why we encourage using secondary profiles
16:29:07 <strcat[m]> secondary profiles don't need to be unlocked to use the device and their sessions can be ended without rebooting
16:29:14 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: we STRONGLY recommend against using developer options, they don't do what you think they do for the reasons you want.
16:29:28 <TheJollyRoger> mrsenshi[m]: there is a usage guide at https://grapheneos.org/usage
16:30:20 <mrsenshi[m]> Thanks, isn't using a separate user account for everything useful to prevent access to developer options?
16:31:52 <mrsenshi[m]> Developer Options are not accessible through the secondary user profiles, and this means I can't access any of those options without unlocking using the admin profile, right?
16:32:47 <strcat[m]> mrsenshi: developer options should be disabled, and enabling it requires entering the lock method separately from unlocking
16:32:57 <strcat[m]> mrsenshi: when you first boot the device, you have to unlock the owner profile
16:33:02 <strcat[m]> mrsenshi: then, you can unlock secondary profiles
16:33:29 <strcat[m]> it's useful to use multiple user profiles because they act as isolated workspaces with separate instances of apps, app data and profile data like contacts / user files
16:34:02 <strcat[m]> it's useful to use a secondary profile as your main everyday usage one if you want to take advantage of 'end session' and not needing to unlock it to use the device after boot
16:34:21 <strcat[m]> keep in mind only Owner profile is notified of updates being downloaded/installed (at least atm)
16:34:40 <mrsenshi[m]> Right, fair enough. What's the rationale behind keeping developer options disabled? Surely forcing dark mode and speeding up the animations slightly isn't going to expose more attack surface?
16:35:54 <Duxy[m]> TheJollyRoger: thanks for telling me. I only had it enabled to activate the sensors off option. Otherwise I have to disable it every for every single app manually. But I disabled the developer options now.
16:35:56 <strcat[m]> mrsenshi: forcing dark mode will make lots of UIs unusable, that's why it's in developer options
16:36:11 <strcat[m]> mrsenshi: developer options are for experimental, broken, unsupported things
16:36:13 <strcat[m]> and developer tools
16:36:21 <strcat[m]> a lot of the options are dangerous even if users don't realize it
16:36:25 <strcat[m]> adb is very dangerous
16:36:36 <strcat[m]> enabling adb and trusting a device drastically reduces your device's security
16:36:51 <strcat[m]> enabling developer tools requires entering the owner lock method
16:37:03 <strcat[m]> if you already have it enabled and someone snatches your device while unlocked they have adb access
16:37:17 <strcat[m]>  * enabling developer options requires entering the owner lock method
16:37:23 <mrsenshi[m]> I'm aware that forcing dark mode breaks some things, and I'm also not aware of there being any concerns regarding screen animations.
16:37:30 <mrsenshi[m]> I also have ADB disabled.
16:37:39 <strcat[m]> well I just explained why having developer options enabled reduces security
16:37:41 <mrsenshi[m]> (i think)
16:37:51 <strcat[m]> even if you enable 0 stuff through it
16:37:55 <strcat[m]>  * even if you enable 0 things through it
16:38:20 <mrsenshi[m]> Alright, fair. Can I achieve faster animations in any other way?
16:38:24 <strcat[m]> if options were ready to be exposed to users... they would be elsewhere in Settings
16:38:33 <strcat[m]> stuff is in developer options because it's unsupported/experimental/broken
16:38:36 <Duxy[m]> I knew a guy that had ADB enabled so he could extract the data from his phone if the screen ever broke lol. I mean, you could just make a backup...
16:39:10 <mrsenshi[m]> And there's no way whatsoever to somehow make the animations less painfully sluggish without compromising security?
16:39:33 <mrsenshi[m]> None?
16:39:40 <mrsenshi[m]> No weird trick?
16:39:54 <strcat[m]> Duxy: it's when you actually trust a computer (which he presumably did for that) that it drastically reduces security
16:40:16 <strcat[m]> dunno what you're doing that you see those animations for any substantial amount of time
16:42:36 <Duxy[m]> strcat: he didn't really care about security. He basically trusted everything. And it wasn't because he was stupid. He knew a lot of stuff. Just couldn't be bothered with it.
16:53:43 <fybb> I'm setting up an environment for building releases of GrapheneOS and would appreciate recommendations for how to handle the signing keys. Ideally they would be hosted offline, but the current build instructions seems to require the keys to be available to the user doing the build and that the build machine is online. Anyone here who have thought about this or have ideas?
16:54:25 <battlepad[m]> hey guys, not sure if its just me but ive been trying for the past 4 hours to get seedvault to backup using nextcloud
16:54:43 <battlepad[m]> for some unknown reason, seedvault keeps coughing up "backup failed"
16:54:49 <battlepad[m]> what steps can I take to troubleshoot this?
16:57:21 <nscnt[m]> mrsenshi: You can disable animations in the accessibility settings
17:40:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> btw when pm-ing developers with issue reports
17:41:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> please file an issue on the issuetracker too
17:41:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> pms are just to share extra data you can't upload publicly on the issue tracker
17:42:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> pms should not be the only way to report us bugs. unless they are in the issue tracker we are not going to be able to efficiently track those
17:50:27 <visla[m]> Is anyone aware of an issue with installing apps from the Aurora Store on GOS? I'm in a secondary profile, the app downloads, says it's installing, and then just doesn't. The Aurora Store has permission to install apps.
18:05:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Timon has joined the Telegram Group!
18:08:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Timon> Is anyone experiencing problems with connecting to their WiFi? I'm facing this issue since a few days now... Can't establish a connection to my router for more than a few secondsCan anyone help or at least tell me, that I'm not the only one with that problem?
18:26:43 <pizzaeater69[m]> <visla[m] "Is anyone aware of an issue with"> You allready have the app in the main profile

18:29:02 <pizzaeater69[m]> Hmmm..
18:31:28 <pizzaeater69[m]> I can check issue tracker if I find something
18:36:59 <pizzaeater69[m]> I do have the same problem sometimes when trying to update an app. Try to clear app cache and reboot device? That usually works for me

19:05:22 <xrm33[m]> Hi guys, is it possible to make the app icons in GrapheneOs to show full names of the files? I find it rather annoying 😓
19:06:08 <visla[m]> pizzaeater69: that seemed to fix it, thank you! I can't believe I didn't turn it off and back on again 🤭

20:12:11 <catfish[m]> xrm33: turn the phone to landscape

20:26:32 <xrm33[m]> Not the power button? I did press the digital button that shows all apps but nothing happened

20:42:28 <qubits> Hello is there any solution to get notifications on grahpeneos
20:50:26 <Thatcher[m]> I get notifications just fine in Graphene
20:52:31 <rawtaz> any swedes here using Mobilt BankID on Graphene?
20:54:07 <Jgem[m]> qubits: what notifications not working?
20:54:29 <qubits> from some apps that i have installed
20:54:35 <qubits> i dont get notifications
20:55:28 <qubits> if the device is locked
20:56:13 <pizzaeater69[m]> <rawtaz "any swedes here using Mobilt Ban"> Im from Finland and banking apps here work
20:56:48 <rawtaz> pizzaeater69[m]: yeah, but you dont have that specific one i guess? what do you have in finland? Mobilt BankID is this national ID app pretty much everyone uses here
20:57:20 <pizzaeater69[m]> Yeah I dont but in general banking apps dont need Google Play Services
20:57:27 <pizzaeater69[m]> Usually
20:58:38 <pizzaeater69[m]> <qubits "Hello is there any solution to g"> Most apps like ProtonMail and Discord needs GooglePlayServices to deliver notifications
20:59:31 <Jgem[m]> qubits: my only problem that is an issue that's been logged is notifications for SMS come in visually and vibrate but no sound when in any user but admin. I have no experience with what you're saying is happening sorry..
20:59:53 <rawtaz> pizzaeater69[m]: i'll just have to see. if it doesnt work im thinking i should try to apply microG and hope that solves it. it seems by https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/duq5qm/anyone_with_experience_with_mobilt_bankidswish/ that id doesnt work
21:00:28 <Jgem[m]> qubits: oh ya.. I just dont get notifications at all for protonmails app.. Needs play services until they hopefully change that
21:00:43 <rawtaz> so does graphene uses install their apps from third party APK stores, or do they usually download them from app store separately and install them manually on the mobile?
21:05:15 <Thatcher[m]> rawtaz I get most of my apps from F-droid mainly for convenience and direct from github for apps with auto-update. I avoid using Aurora Store. For apps that require verification like Signal's apk, downloading on a pc might be a better option.
21:06:04 <kradav[m]> <pizzaeater69[m] "Most apps like ProtonMail and Di"> id only add to this that in some cases, like with discord, notifications work without google play service, when its in foreground[but its not really gos related, dont want to go too offtopic]
21:06:07 <rawtaz> isnt there a high risk of fishy apps from f-droid?
21:06:33 <rawtaz> Thatcher[m]: ^ and also what type of verification are you referring to? sorry if these are noob quesitons
21:09:00 <Thatcher[m]> rawtaz I'm referring to verifying that the  signing certificate matches the SHA256 fingerprint of the apk to make sure it's a genuine copy and not a malicious hacker-inserted build of Signal
21:10:21 <Thatcher[m]> Verifying signing certificates is something that should not be ignored especially when downloading operating systems and chat apps
21:11:50 <rawtaz> Thatcher[m]: yeah. do you run some tool on the pc to do that? i understand the concept and dabble with signatures etc, im just not sure what the conventional way to verify an apk is
21:11:54 <Thatcher[m]> And yes, fishy apps can make their way into the F-droid repo. Make sure you are not downloading a ton of apps by random new developers
21:12:32 <rawtaz> ok. im thinking that getting an anonymous account on Google Play and then downloading the APKs from there would work too, or is that not feasible for some reason?
21:13:25 <Thatcher[m]> If you want to download apps from the Google Play store then get Aurora OSS store
21:13:59 <kradav[m]> shouldnt we move this to offtopic instead? its not exactly related to grapheneos afaik
21:14:17 <Thatcher[m]> kradav you are right
21:23:28 <osund> rawtaz: I'm a swede using Bank-ID
21:23:37 <osund> on grapheneos
21:24:06 <rawtaz> osund: oh my, cool! may i PM you or could you perhaps sum up how you installed and set it up in the offtopic channel?
21:24:20 <osund> rawtaz: sure, PM
21:24:26 <rawtaz> thanks :)
21:26:18 <qubits> wich app can you recommend me for work profile
21:26:36 <qubits> I installed Shelter
21:28:40 <borges[m]> qubits: check the logs. I've seen it discussed before and iirc, none are recommended because they aren't any better than a secondary user and you're giving a lot of control to that app which might have its own issues
21:29:14 <qubits> yes but notifications will work then for my apps
21:30:39 <qubits> Notifications are important for me and a lot of apps i uses doesnt get notifications on grapheneos
21:32:08 <borges[m]> yep, understandable, I'm fairly new so don't have anything to add
21:33:10 <borges[m]> On another note, is there a way to install an apk for all users? I see references elsewhere that on stock adb install does install for all users, but not seeing that in GOS. And if there's a non-adb method better
22:12:09 <catfish[m]> xrm33: search in settings for 'allow home screen rotation'
22:17:21 <xrm33[m]> <catfish[m] "xrm33: search in settings for 'a"> Yep this worked, thanks
22:17:51 <xrm33[m]> But in portrait mode still doesn't show full names
22:18:03 <xrm33[m]> I guess it's just the way it is
22:39:15 <thephonexper[m]> Hi is it possible to enable airplane mode 'forever' and lock it?
22:53:19 <akc3n[m]> <thephonexper[m] "Hi is it possible to enable airp"> Once airplane mode is set as active. It will remain active after rebooting, or powering on/off.
22:54:39 <thephonexper[m]> Yes i understand but I want to lock it so it cant be turned off? Is that even possible?
22:56:58 <akc3n[m]> thephonexper:  if your phone is locked and someone tries to swipe down and tap on active airplane mode to disable it, it will ask for the lock screen password/pin/biometric.
22:57:11 <akc3n[m]> Try it and see for yourself.
23:05:35 <thephonexper[m]> I want to use my phone only in airplane mode, is it possible to lock the option to turn it off with a password or something? I want to make sure that it stays on
23:36:32 <ulmirdin[m]> You can just take out your sim.
23:40:23 <quipoa[m]> hello it is possible to block access to the settings ?
23:42:05 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy quipoa[m], unlike a desktop operating system, apps do not have access to their own settings. There would be little to gain in adding a second password to access settings, given the presence of the profile functionality which allows multiple contextual identities or users to coexist on the same phone.
23:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> There would be little gain except for theatrics, and GrapheneOS has pledged to avoid theatrics when it comes to settings, frills, and tunables.
23:43:11 <TheJollyRoger> thephonexper[m]: if you want, you can turn on Airplane Mode, then remove the Toggle from Quick Access.
23:44:39 <TheJollyRoger> quipoa[m]: so, apps cannot change or set their own permissions, change persistent systemwide settings, etc.
23:46:04 <quipoa[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you for replying, and it is possible to have access like SuperUser for example ?
23:46:59 <TheJollyRoger> quipoa[m]: Ahoy and welcome aboard. By default, you'll have the owner profile. The owner profile can add and delete other profiles. However, app-accessible root will never be considered on GrapheneOS.
23:47:32 <TheJollyRoger> Only init, vold, and kernel should have root-equivalent access on any Android-based system. There may be a few others that I'm not familiar with, but the list is a short list.
23:48:23 <quipoa[m]> TheJollyRoger:  ok thanks 👍️
23:48:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, anything else I might be able to help you with?
23:49:51 <quipoa[m]> TheJollyRoger: if I have any questions I will ask you, thank you
23:50:00 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, ye be welcome.
23:53:56 <quipoa[m]> if I unsolder components like the camera, microphone and sim card reader of the motherboard, is there a risk of compromising the safety or stability of graphene?
23:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> quipoa[m]: We get this question a lot, and my answer for it is that the security gains are going to be extremely to nonexistent, for the cost and risk of cutting up your phone.
23:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> *extremely small to nonexistent
23:55:33 <TheJollyRoger> The threat model for permanent disablement of the peripherals is if you feel the device has been compromised, but at that point, there is no point to even using it.
23:56:25 <TheJollyRoger> So you're essentially going to be slashing up your phone for no real gain, and even if you removed the microphone, remember a phone that is compromised to the point of the attacker being in complete control of the hardware (let's consider this as a thought exercise) could reverse the polarity on the speakers to act as a crude microphone.
23:57:51 <TheJollyRoger> Will it compromise the stability of Graphene? Well, taping over the camera doesn't, or if you microphone breaks, that's no problem. However, it's not an increase in security, and won't give you any extra security, even if it might score you Opsec Nerd Credit.
23:59:11 <quipoa[m]> TheJollyRoger: yes it seems to be risky and unnecessary indeed.
