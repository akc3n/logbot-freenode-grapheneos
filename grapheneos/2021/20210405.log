00:00:07 <TheJollyRoger> Type in "/me does something" in Matrix.
00:00:24 <anupritaisno1> TheJollyRoger can you set +v on me
00:12:21 <sizzyb> where is the developer settings? I'm trying to disable OEM unlocking
00:13:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sizzyb: you can search for it in the settings app
00:14:17 <TheJollyRoger> hi sizzyb, you'll have to reenable it. I want you to go to Settings -> System -> About Phone and tap on "Build Number" ten times with your finger.
00:14:23 <grapheneos_user_> <sizzyb "where is the developer settings?"> Same place where you enabled it
00:14:25 <TheJollyRoger> It should report "You are now a developer!"
00:14:29 <sizzyb> ha i did nothing showed. May it have turned off automatically?
00:14:38 <sizzyb> Oh gotta activate it again first
00:14:45 <TheJollyRoger> sizzyb: yes, you have to reactivate it. It's off by default on GrapheneOS.
00:15:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> damn, Pete, you do type fast XD
00:15:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> gj)
00:15:19 <TheJollyRoger> Heh heh, a little!
00:16:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Welcome aboard, sizzyb!
00:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> Once you slide OEM unlocking back to off it may ask you to reboot. Once you get past that you can turn developer options back off using the slide toggle at the top.
00:16:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
00:16:40 <TheJollyRoger> Since developer options aren't designed to be used on a daily use/production device, they often will introduce additional attack surface.
00:17:55 <TheJollyRoger> This should shut the menu back off once you exit it, and prevent accidental/inadvertent activation.
00:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> Since not all developer options are reset/disabled once you switch off dev options.
00:18:20 <m2tu[m]> Jolly.... Is it possible to set a preinstalled password on a build ?
00:18:31 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: I don't think so.
00:18:40 <m2tu[m]> ok
00:19:18 <sizzyb> TheJollyRoger boom! operation GrapheneOS completed. Thanks for the help guys happy to be aboard
00:19:39 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! Tonight we sail for privacy and security, shipmate!
00:20:11 <sizzyb> TheJollyRoger¬† ;p
00:20:40 <TheJollyRoger> If ye find GrapheneOS useful, please sling the devs a donation at https://grapheneos.org/donate if you can, it keeps this tub sailing!
00:22:35 <TheJollyRoger> If you have any questions, feel free to ask, and hopefully I might be able to find you an answer.
00:23:44 <seashield[m]> TheJollyRoger Hi Jolly, mind if I pm you?
00:30:01 <TheJollyRoger> seashield[m]: go ahead.
00:45:56 <jj1013[m]> <sizzyb "TheJollyRoger boom! operation Gr"> Cheers, governor!
00:47:45 <sizzyb> i wish yall accepted bcash lol

00:48:50 <TheJollyRoger> There ya go!
00:49:08 <jj1013[m]> üòÅ
00:49:16 <TheJollyRoger> sizzyb: ah, oh noooo, haha! Incompatibility continues to be a downer!
00:50:05 <jj1013[m]> <sizzyb "i wish yall accepted bcash lol"> Exchanges are always a thing. =)
00:51:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha! I unfortunately can't help there, sadly. I'm not a cryptocurrency guy; some people have FOMO, I have what I call FOBSCO - Fear Of Being Screwed Over.
00:52:34 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ahaha! I unfortunately can't hel"> I have FOLAD ‚îÄ Fear Of Losing A Dip
00:53:00 <m2tu[m]> Jolly pls one more quest...  regarding to init.hardware.rc
00:53:08 <southron[m]> BTC ‚ö°Network ftw
00:53:12 <m2tu[m]> can i set chmod rules here for /sdcard/
00:53:22 <jj1013[m]> Hooray for Monero.
00:53:30 <m2tu[m]> i want to set chmod 0444 /storage/sdcard0
00:53:43 <m2tu[m]> but dont know where ot in wichih file i shall put this one
00:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: ah, that's unfortunately something I can't help you with at the moment, sorry.
00:55:14 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: yes, very much so, haha.
00:55:38 <m2tu[m]> TheJollyRoger: alright
00:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: good luck!
00:56:13 <jj1013[m]> Hey, TheJollyRoger, is there an user-friendly way to run a GrapheneOS emulator? I may want to use GrapheneOS in my desktop computer while I earn the money for a GPixel.
00:56:43 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: I've been told that there is a way to do it, but unfortunately at this time I haven't tried that myself, sadly.
00:57:12 <TheJollyRoger> So I unfortunately can't walk you through it. I know that a few people here have compiled and run GrapheneOS in an emulator using Android Studio, but again, I haven't done that myself.
00:57:42 <sizzyb> TheJollyRoger lawllll I guess I could use stealthex.io
00:57:46 <TheJollyRoger> Because I haven't done it myself I think I'll have to bow out of this question, hopefully someone who has can help you more than I.
00:57:56 <TheJollyRoger> sizzyb: as always, be careful and good luck!
01:06:48 <sizzyb> omg I just downloaded and used W10Privacy... windows really be raping you
01:09:35 <strcat[m]> off-topic
01:31:52 <b28> hello
01:41:31 <fretegi> evening folks
01:41:39 <fretegi> having some trouble restoring a nextcloud backup
01:42:06 <rny> whats the problem
01:42:14 <fretegi> fresh install, when it asks to restore, i click nextcloud. but nohting happens..
01:42:43 <fretegi> if i continue setting up the phone and manually setup nextcloud, then it seems to want to just do a backup of the new device, i dont see a restore option anyway
01:42:49 <fretegi> anywhere*
01:43:29 <rny> can you film it or log it?
01:43:55 <fretegi> which part?
01:44:22 <rny> from trying to restore
01:44:46 <fretegi> i can try
01:44:52 <rny> iirc the setup wizard flow has a page that lets you pick restore from backup
01:45:00 <fretegi> it does
01:45:07 <rny> and what happens when you click on it?
01:45:21 <fretegi> then asks where the backup is, its on nextcloud.. i tap that and nothing happens
01:45:32 <rny> have you installed nextcloud?
01:45:38 <rny> oh
01:45:40 <rny> lol
01:45:50 <rny> you cant since its part of the setup flow
01:46:04 <fretegi> see at that point nc is not installed.  so if i skip, then install next cloud, i dont seem to have a location to restore
01:46:18 <rny> i get what you mean now
01:46:20 <fretegi> i can setup a new backup .. gives a new 12 work code etc.
01:46:20 <rny> ahha
01:46:55 <fretegi> i have tried a new code, and the code from the old phone that i backed the data up from, neither seems to have a restore option, unless im just missing it ha
01:48:21 <fretegi> so how do you restore once the phone is running i guess is really the question ha
01:48:26 <rny> can you try to download your backup from NC, then adb push it to the phone
01:48:43 <fretegi> actually trying to manually log into the nc acct now
01:49:14 <rny> actually dont use ADB, just use the standard Android MTP to move the backup files onto the phone if possible
01:49:45 <fretegi> can i just use a usb drive?
01:50:29 <rny> yes, you need to toggle the usb peripherals in settings though
01:51:05 <fretegi> hmmm
01:52:12 <fretegi> sheesh
01:52:25 <fretegi> so i see directories in NC from seedvault
01:52:40 <rny> there's auto-restore
01:53:07 <fretegi> but none seem to have any data.. seems odd, the old phone took a long while to run the backup sequence
01:53:59 <fretegi> yea i see it
01:54:24 <fretegi> but u just toggle it on, i mean what if u make a change and want to restore right now, then what do you do?
01:54:35 <fretegi> this is the first time i played with the backup process
01:55:20 <fretegi> in this case i have the old phone and can just re-run the backup... BUT, i did actually want to undo some changes by restoring an old backup...
02:00:11 <rny> no snapshoting capability unfortunately
02:00:24 <fretegi> so in this case ill just deal with manually playing with a USB.. but for my own knowledge, whats the deal with the 12 word thing
02:00:40 <fretegi> so is it referencing that device or a backup
02:00:44 <rny> the 12 words are used to derive a key that encrypts your backups
02:01:07 <fretegi> so the backups are simply tied to the user acct on NC then?
02:01:22 <fretegi> seedvault just grabs whats there then?
02:01:24 <rny> the backups are encrypted and stored on NC
02:01:50 <rny> seedvault just grabs wtv backup files that can be found where you pointed the app to
02:02:35 <fretegi> gotcha, so what im trying to figure out is, can i backup multiple phones using one NC user id? if so, how do i tell graphene which to grab
02:02:54 <rny> use different directories in the same NC account
02:02:58 <rny> for different phones
02:04:29 <fretegi> that makes sense, but never get prompted to choose a directory when backing up... hmm..
02:04:42 <fretegi> ill pay more attention on this run, gonna try to restore form a usb now
02:09:29 <fretegi> backup should pull over all settings right?
02:09:49 <fretegi> gestures, timezone, time format etc.
02:10:18 <redbeard72> Anybody know if putting Graphene on the Pixel4A(4G) void the warranty?
02:10:58 <mefistofeles> oh, that shouldn't be, but I'm dubious
02:52:29 <redbeard72> ok, thanks.
02:55:14 <fretegi> mefistofeles, yea seems like many of the apps i have to reload data for
03:05:04 <fretegi> well still much faster than starting from scratch ha.  well thanks for the help!
03:05:13 <fretegi> love this product
03:27:29 <jake79> hi all
03:28:04 <jake79> may i ask a question re: the .flah all.bat command
03:28:13 <jake79> flash*
03:28:45 <jake79> on a pixel 4a and am using adb fatboot 1.3
03:29:03 <rny[m]> please use the web installer
03:29:15 <jake79> it keeps having errors
03:29:24 <rny[m]> what are the errors?
03:29:25 <jake79> downloading¬† the image
03:29:54 <jake79> you must be able to do it manually if your not a muppet
03:30:36 <jake79> does anyone here have experience doing it
03:30:37 <jake79> ??
03:30:51 <rny> what?
03:30:57 <rny> did you just call me a muppet?
03:31:21 <jake79> i actually havea slight problem with a provisioned device tat has a esim that stays when the device is reflashed
03:31:26 <jake79> no mate
03:31:27 <jake79> me
03:32:00 <jake79> i didnt install an esim so why does it have one in the barcode section
03:32:23 <rny> do you wanna share some screenshots?
03:32:29 <rny> so we understand better
03:32:40 <jake79> umm yea sheesh
03:32:51 <M---------------> There is nothing new at https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog, but Seamless Update Client wants me to reboot. Is the page not up to date or what is happening?
03:33:17 <rny> M---------------: latest release was 30.03.2021
03:33:25 <rny> maybe you just downloaded this release
03:37:04 <M---------------> I believed I did that several days ago. Turns out I'm still at one earlier.
03:37:04 <M---------------> I connect daily to the net. How do I not recieve the update until now?
03:37:04 <M---------------> Anyways... I'll reboot now.
03:41:06 <M---------------> Alright, should have checked the build number in the settings before disturbing you... sorry.
03:45:39 <rny> no prob üòâ
03:52:15 <localstorm> Hi GrapheneOS enthusiasts! I followed a CLI-based instructions to install GrapheneOS on Pixel 4a and I am witnessing the following: the first thing is the message "This device is loading a different OS, press power to pause". Then when I don't press pause it shows Google logo, then GrapheneOS logo and then it boots just fine. I thought the verified
03:52:16 <localstorm> boot is supposed to make OS image "trusted" and not show the warning at boot time. Does anyone know what I can do about this issue?
03:53:03 <localstorm> it's consistently happening, I am sure I wasn't hacked :)
03:53:06 <rny> normal
03:53:18 <rny> yellow triangle is fine
03:54:20 <localstorm> hm.. how'd I identify tampering then? Isn't it supposed to show up only if the OS image signature is different?
03:55:06 <localstorm> Or maybe the right question is what does it mean different? Different from factory image or what? :)
03:57:29 <rny> part of the CLI step involves installing the factory image public key
03:57:47 <rny> *avb_custome_key
03:58:48 <rny> as part of verified boot, the boot process checks if the image can be verified against this key
03:59:59 <localstorm> Rny, the only section mentioning this keu in https://grapheneos.org/install/cli is about restoring original image: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
04:00:15 <localstorm> Rny, the only section mentioning this key in https://grapheneos.org/install/cli is about restoring original image: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
04:00:55 <localstorm> > as part of verified boot, the boot process checks if the image can be verified against this key
04:00:56 <localstorm> I was hoping to see no warning every time
04:01:23 <rny> you will always see the yellow triangle warning if you're not booting Google's official vendor image
04:02:07 <rny> localstorm: https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/boot-flow
04:02:26 <rny> localstorm: https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/device-state
04:04:53 <rny> you should see the `fastboot flash avb_custom_key` step in the flash all script
04:04:56 <localstorm> I see, Rny. Thank you for your guidance
04:05:05 <rny> iirc
04:05:09 <localstorm> I think this settles it
04:05:46 <rny> no prob üòâ
04:05:53 <localstorm> love this community:) ¬†Cheers
04:06:00 <rny> another satisfied customer, NEXT!
04:08:02 <jake79> umm yea sheesh how to sendan image of the esim barcode this laptop has been adninistrator restricted to disabke the camera
04:08:18 <jake79> how do i attach an image in here
04:09:14 <rny> upload to imgur then share the URL here
04:09:45 <jake79> cheers

05:15:36 <jake79> in barcode section
05:17:34 <jake79> how to remove
05:17:55 <jake79> device was provisioned without consent
05:20:51 <jake79> sorry wrong link

05:23:22 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Have you used stock OS and setup eSIM there?
05:23:36 <jake79> no
05:23:58 <jake79> never was booted as a stock pixel
05:25:54 <jake79> https://imgur.com/gallery/2m2sg0s
05:26:30 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <jake79 "no"> Yeah, me neither
05:26:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> And I also have all those barcodes
05:27:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's working as intended tbh, those are hardware identifiers, which are not accessible anyways by user apps, and system apps without READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission
05:27:35 <jake79> why is there an esim assigned to my device i didnt order one nor¬† pay for one
05:27:49 <jake79> buyllshuit
05:27:56 <jake79> if you read the recovery logs
05:28:33 <jake79> it says the device has been proviioned and the esim is not able to be deleted when then device is reset
05:28:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <jake79 "device was provisioned without c"> It's not really provisioned though, without setting up an eSIM without stock
05:28:43 <jake79> because of the assignment
05:28:47 <jake79> of the number
05:29:09 <jake79> that dictates whether it is erased duringdevice reset
05:29:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <jake79 "if you read the recovery logs"> Proof?
05:29:38 <jake79> yea they were highly suspicious
05:29:49 <jake79> in terms of their content
05:29:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Proof?"> I mean, can you send me the logs you are speaking ofm
05:30:08 <jake79> so it must be in the firmware
05:30:29 <jake79> and if somneone programmed it in that manner there must be a way to rewrite it'
05:30:52 <jake79> yea i have like a twenty minute video of it
05:31:25 <jake79> they have now actually been removed but i still have the usb key
05:31:36 <jake79> i copied the vid on otg
05:32:56 <jake79> is there any info available on rewriting the barcode setings in fastboot'
05:33:16 <jake79> you should be able to either customise itor rewrite it
05:33:24 <jake79> its not locked by fuse
05:33:27 <jake79> i dont believe
05:33:58 <jake79> the pixel device offers to download you a esim from a provider when it syrats up
05:34:06 <jake79> it would not already have a imsi
05:34:10 <jake79> ???????????????????????/
05:34:33 <jake79> eSIM EID
05:34:43 <jake79> what does that stand for
05:35:20 <jake79> because my device has tghe ability to turn on data settings with no sinm in it
05:35:29 <jake79> it attempts to obscure the menus but
05:35:32 <jake79> its there
05:35:55 <strcat[m]> jake79: that does not mean you have an eSIM...
05:36:21 <jake79> what is an eSIM EID
05:36:28 <strcat[m]> jake79: can you please explain why you think you have an eSIM set up?
05:36:37 <jake79> what specifically does that stand for'
05:36:50 <jake79> go and check the images
05:36:55 <strcat[m]> it's the id of the secure element implementing eSIM
05:37:05 <strcat[m]> does not mean you have an eSIM set up
05:37:18 <jake79> so its like an additional imei
05:37:26 <jake79> or actually an imsi
05:37:39 <jake79> it identifies the esim imsi
05:37:40 <strcat[m]> the SoC has a secure element which among other features provides an environment to run an eSIM applet
05:38:06 <strcat[m]> carriers choose to trust certain secure elements to run their eSIM applets
05:38:06 <jake79> why does it havea barcode to scan
05:38:18 <strcat[m]> it's just a barcode representation of that number
05:39:26 <strcat[m]> https://www.gsma.com/services/eis-euicc-identifiers/
05:39:39 <strcat[m]> > All GSMA eSIM compatible devices following the industry GSMA eSIM Specifications as defined in SGP.01, SGP.02 and SGP.21, and SGP.22 require a unique, persistent and secure EID to identify an embedded or removable eUICC.
05:40:04 <jake79> https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/dpy9fm/download_your_eid_to_your_pixel_4_4xl/
05:40:14 <jake79> nope
05:40:47 <strcat[m]> I gave you the answer
05:40:52 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with
05:41:16 <jake79> https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/17/esim-on-t-mobile-postpaid/
05:41:23 <strcat[m]> read what's on the GSM association site
05:41:41 <strcat[m]> it's unclear why you're linking these things
05:41:48 <strcat[m]> it's unclear what you're trying to do or what you're concerned about
05:42:07 <strcat[m]> you're going to need to read the information linked above and clarify what you want if there is still something beyond that
05:43:03 <jake79> its a second imei
05:43:05 <jake79> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10402530?hl=en
05:43:27 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading https://www.gsma.com/services/eis-euicc-identifiers/
05:43:34 <jake79> hmmm
05:43:53 <strcat[m]> EID is a distinct thing from the IMEIs
05:44:09 <strcat[m]> the radio has 2 IMEIs because it is dual SIM (can use both SIM and eSIM at the same time)
05:44:09 <jake79> still doesnt do much for the privacy of omeera digitals encrypted esims
05:44:24 <strcat[m]> this isn't Omerta
05:44:27 <strcat[m]> we aren't involved with them
05:44:28 <jake79> but at least there esims delete when the phone resets
05:44:39 <jake79> i know
05:44:59 <jake79> i never said you were
05:45:08 <strcat[m]> the secure element environment where the eSIM applet runs has an id (EID)
05:45:12 <strcat[m]> and there is a 2nd IMEI for it
05:45:18 <strcat[m]> this is required by the standard
05:45:23 <jake79> ok
05:45:28 <jake79> understood
05:45:46 <strcat[m]> cellular networks don't offer a way to use them anonymously, at most they are pseudonymous
05:46:01 <strcat[m]> it's not like Wi-Fi
05:46:10 <jake79> well unless you use an x-cellular device
05:46:23 <jake79> which changes its imei at will
05:46:55 <jake79> and extracts the encryption key from the sim and makes an alternate one but rretains the phone¬† nnumber
05:47:15 <jake79> have a look at youtube imsi chnage
05:47:16 <jake79> r
05:47:18 <jake79> changer
05:47:32 <jake79> they are designed primarily for law enforcement use
05:47:42 <jake79> imsi changer
05:48:40 <jake79> I'm the exclusive distirbutor for their products in a certain country
05:49:21 <jake79> also if you look at the sim technology first point mobile guard
05:50:27 <jake79> you may understand that here legitimate flaws in the cellular system which compromise many thibgs inclusive of safety and privacy as welkl as contravene the gdpr
05:50:43 <jake79> medical

05:51:34 <strcat[m]> don't understand what any of this stuff has to do with the channel
05:51:42 <jake79> there are 15 first point mobile guard mvno just in the iot arena in the eu
05:51:51 <jake79> cough
05:52:12 <jake79> supposedly grapheneos is a privacy oriented phone os
05:52:33 <jake79> it has a major problem with ss7 and sigtran
05:52:44 <jake79> not to mention imsi catchers
05:53:28 <jake79> i mean why even bother making something resilient to have information and security and privacy engineered to be more robust
05:53:36 <jake79> when the problem is the network'

05:54:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
05:54:19 <jake79> the first point mobile guard system operates by adding addition java applets to the sim
05:54:23 <jake79> euither ota
05:54:26 <jake79> or in a new sim

06:03:23 <jprince602[m]> yeah its the same conclusion I came to but figured I'll ask.
06:03:33 <jprince602[m]> Wickr or Signal?

13:39:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> somenerd: the only devices with properly implemented security features and support for an alternative OS are Google Pixels.
13:39:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> The main question being asked was basically that: if Google design a chipset from the ground up, collaborating with Samsung, would they have any real motivation to provide support for an alternative OS.
13:39:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> If we assume Qualcomm is largely responsible for laying the foundations for that support, and see that Google have worked with Nvidia and Intel on hardware with no interest in alternative OS support, then we might assume that Graphene OS would be more interested in Qualcomm reference devices as a development platform (when their SPUs are up to speed in required features vs. Titan M)

14:42:41 <Guest938> Thanks for your answers regarding no need to use anti-virus on grapheneos. Also, I read only that instead of using anti-virus, the best thing to do to increase security is to activate attestation service instead. What does it mean?

15:35:30 <M---------------> <Anri "I'd like to know more about Grap"> Yes, via Aurora Store for example. Not all will work because of dependencies to Google Software, but many will.
15:35:39 <mynacol[m]> Anri: You can't have the Play Store (the app), but many here use Aurora Store, another app installing apps from the Play Store (the app database)
15:41:53 <Anri> I'm currently have xiaomi mi 6x with Firefox Lite, Orbot, Signal, Tutanota, Tresorit, and Fair Email installed along with banking apps in Indonesia which I use.. My next question is whether the banking apps will be available on the Aurora Store. I'm currently saving to buy a Google Pixel 4a. Apologies for my questions since I'm a newbie at this
15:44:32 <Anri> Hi does one use the Aura Store anyway?
15:49:03 <Anri> I'll come by again once I've bought the Google pixel 4a. It would be interesting to know how Google pixel 6 with its own SoC fares. For the time being, as long as I can use Pixel 4a with Graphene OS, I'll stick to it. Thanks for bearing with me
15:50:24 <M---------------> Anri: They should be available, but I can't tell wether they will function. If the app depends on Google services, possibly not.

17:45:41 <arnaldo88> Hello
17:46:25 <arnaldo88> I am trying to figure out how to restore my grapheneos from the seedvault backup that I created. I stored the backup on an flashdrive
17:46:43 <strcat[m]> during setupwizard run on owner profile
17:46:49 <arnaldo88> it's a flashdrive with USB-C connection
17:46:55 <strcat[m]> keep in mind seedvault backs up OS and app data
17:47:08 <strcat[m]> you need to back up your profile's home directory yourself (the files in file manager)
17:47:17 <strcat[m]> and doesn't cover secondary profiles yet
17:47:23 <strcat[m]> arnaldo88: you plug in the flash drive
17:47:26 <strcat[m]> while going through setup
17:47:28 <arnaldo88> oh, so I have to format the phone first?
17:47:33 <strcat[m]> there's an adapter that comes with the phone
17:47:40 <strcat[m]> arnaldo88: yes unless you do it in an advanced way
17:47:45 <strcat[m]> what exactly do you want to restore?
17:48:10 <strcat[m]> there is technically a way to do a full restore without that
17:48:17 <strcat[m]> but it requires an advanced method for developers for now
17:48:26 <arnaldo88> I just want to bring back my phone to the state that it was back them. I changed many apps
17:48:35 <strcat[m]> arnaldo88: if you enable the option for it, it will restore app data for an app when reinstalling an app
17:48:50 <strcat[m]> arnaldo88: and keep in mind some apps disable backups for whatever reason
17:49:18 <strcat[m]> arnaldo88: I recommend plugging it is and using the feature for restoring app data when reinstalling an app
17:50:24 <arnaldo88> ok!
17:50:28 <arnaldo88> thanks :)
17:50:48 <arnaldo88> I try to format and then restore
17:50:53 <arnaldo88> will try
17:51:34 <strcat[m]> not my recommendation
17:51:48 <strcat[m]> please fully read what I wrote above about needing to back up your home directory yourself
17:55:03 <arnaldo88> sure
17:55:23 <arnaldo88> thanks for your help
18:14:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!–∫–∞–ø—é—à–æ–Ω> Hello everyone how are you can someone explain to me if I can change the Google animation when my Google pixel starts up just before the GrapheneOS animation?
18:17:57 <strcat[m]> that's the boot splash for the hardware
18:17:59 <strcat[m]> can't change that
18:18:11 <strcat[m]> you could port GrapheneOS to a different phone or help work towards having one built to run it
18:27:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!–∫–∞–ø—é—à–æ–Ω> Ok thank u üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
18:37:27 <wiegolf[m]> So glad I could find this room. I am so happy to have invested in my privacy and a Pixel4 with GraphenOS! Thank you for building this software and make it available!
18:37:34 <nogorono> Downloading bonito-factory-2021.03.30.02.zip... and then stucks error unandetified i have updated windows and chrome but i dont use oficial google pixel cable besause my laptop doesnt have sutch a port maybe this is the problem??
18:37:50 <nogorono> in web instaler all these
18:44:04 <waltercool> Is possible to make GrapheneOS work as a Project Treble build?
18:47:41 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't be GrapheneOS
18:47:42 <strcat[m]> so no
18:47:58 <strcat[m]> you can use a subset of GrapheneOS that way but it isn't GrapheneOS as the OS
18:48:02 <strcat[m]> just a piece of it
18:48:33 <strcat[m]> Treble is already used everywhere so I'm interpreting your question in the way that makes sense to me
18:48:34 <waltercool> oh :(  So, only for Pixel phones
18:48:48 <strcat[m]> so the question I'm answering is "Can you use GrapheneOS as a Generic System Image?"
18:48:59 <strcat[m]> waltercool: no
18:49:09 <strcat[m]> waltercool: but using it only for the system image is not GrapheneOS
18:49:26 <waltercool> you mean due Kernel modifications?
18:49:30 <waltercool> and recovery
18:49:40 <strcat[m]> and beyond that
18:49:50 <strcat[m]> it also depends on hardware and firmware security
18:49:51 <strcat[m]> and those have to be updated
18:50:04 <strcat[m]> and vendor has to be hardened to the extent possible too
18:50:15 <strcat[m]> we ship our own SELinux policies for vendor and build a lot of it
18:50:25 <strcat[m]> could be building most but we haven't had resources to put into that
18:50:36 <waltercool> that make sense, and a common problem on LineageOS builds
18:50:44 <wags> hey everyone
18:50:58 <strcat[m]> there has to be per-device hardening too
18:50:59 <wiegolf[m]> Hey
18:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy nogorono: most commonly that error appears if you are in incognito mode. Are you in incognito mode?
18:51:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
18:51:13 <strcat[m]> a lot of devices are missing most of the standard AOSP hardening that's more device specific
18:51:18 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy wiegolf[m], welcome to the channel!
18:51:22 <strcat[m]> and we can't do anything about insecure hardware, firmware, etc.
18:51:35 <strcat[m]> and we depend on hardware security features being present and properly implemented
18:51:38 <wags> Has anyone had any issues with Bitwarden on a 4a5g? Works fine on my 4a.. but just get stuck on the grey 'Bitwarden' screen on my 4a5g
18:51:45 <waltercool> strcat[m]: Agree, and worries me as well, blobs issues can't be fixed
18:52:15 <strcat[m]> ideally we would have our own device
18:52:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy wags, I see you're crossposting from the offtopic channel. You'll probably get better results in that channel, since there we're cleared to discuss topics not topical to GrapheneOS.
18:52:21 <strcat[m]> keep in mind our goal is not broad device support
18:52:29 <strcat[m]> our goal is not giving people a way to make arbitrary devices less insecure
18:52:52 <wags> got ya Jolly, thanks
18:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> arr, ye be welcome wags, good luck!
18:53:15 <strcat[m]> our goal is making the most private/secure phone we can without losing any important functionality from AOSP
18:53:16 <waltercool> yep, agreed
18:53:30 <wags> cheers, I'll hang here a bit too
18:53:35 <strcat[m]> part of that is choosing hardware wisely, reporting issues to the vendor (which we do), device-specific hardening work
18:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, ye be welcome to!
18:53:46 <strcat[m]> we do a lot of work on working around or resolving device-specific issues uncovered by mitigations
18:53:48 <strcat[m]> each device is a lot of work
18:53:52 <strcat[m]> and will only become more work as we do more
18:54:02 <waltercool> strcat[m]: There is some guide for that? Or community for it?
18:54:05 <strcat[m]> ideally we would be exclusively supporting hardware made to run GrapheneOS
18:54:20 <waltercool> The website only mentions Pixel phones, but I guess that's because those are "official" builds
18:54:29 <strcat[m]> waltercool: https://grapheneos.org/build covers a lot of stuff but it can't really go that much into detail on what's required
18:54:43 <strcat[m]> someone working on device maintenance has to do a very broad range of things
18:55:01 <strcat[m]> we are not doing everything we used to do atm because of our resources being spent elsewhere, dealing with a lot of attacks on the project
18:55:14 <strcat[m]> we're missing a lot of important things we used to do
18:55:18 <TheJollyRoger> Well, to back that up; it's relatively simple to get an operating system to just boot on a device, but to actually do it in a way that's sustainable and matches and meets the security properties of a full production release done by a vendor, let alone exceed them, is a very difficult commitment.
18:55:35 <wags> strcat: looking to have your own device made to your specs like System 76 ish?
18:55:48 <strcat[m]> not like that
18:56:02 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why Pixels were chosen is because Google is the only vendor that has thus far been willing to work with and engage with open source efforts, and offers full vendor support for non-vendor operating systems.
18:56:27 <TheJollyRoger> Other handset vendors are either hostile to this, or don't give this adequate thought nor adequate support and simply have an attitude of "you bought it, we've got your money, it's your problem now."
18:56:37 <strcat[m]> most phones disable hardware-based security features for alternate OSes
18:56:38 <waltercool> strcat[m]: I wil ltake a look about that, seems like an interesting and bit underrated project. At least make sure some Samsung devices could be covered, as they own huge part of Android market
18:56:41 <strcat[m]> they also lack proper security updates
18:56:52 <strcat[m]> and don't ship all the recommended hardware-based security features
18:57:00 <strcat[m]> and have serious flaws in how they handle things
18:57:11 <strcat[m]> waltercool: Samsung doesn't make phones that are viable targets
18:57:12 <TheJollyRoger> waltercool: unfortunately, Samsung is hostile to us; they have an E-Fuse that burns out if you attempt to unlock the bootloader, which permanently disables some security features of the handset.
18:57:29 <strcat[m]> waltercool: unless you convince them to start supporting security for alternate OSes and providing proper support for AOSP
18:57:58 <waltercool> What about Sony? They have an AOSP team on their side
18:57:59 <strcat[m]> waltercool: effort put into a port to a device that does not meet the standards will never be official / actual GrapheneOS
18:58:08 <strcat[m]> waltercool: Sony has good AOSP support
18:58:14 <strcat[m]> waltercool: they don't support security features with an alternate OS
18:58:19 <strcat[m]> among other problems
18:58:44 <waltercool> likely due commercial agreements, hmm
18:58:46 <strcat[m]> they also have issues moving to new major releases in a timely fashion
18:58:54 <strcat[m]> waltercool: no, likely not due to commercial agreements
18:58:59 <strcat[m]> they skip doing proper support for alternate OSes
18:59:06 <strcat[m]> most people who want it do not care one bit about lost security
18:59:11 <ultimateextras[m> <strcat[m] "they skip doing proper support f"> PS3 anyone?
18:59:18 <waltercool> lmao
18:59:42 <waltercool> to be fair with Sony, their Playstation brand isn't very close to their mobile team
18:59:56 <ultimateextras[m> <waltercool "to be fair with Sony, their Play"> Same Megacorp...
19:00:29 <TheJollyRoger> Vendor support is required for alternative operating systems to work on a platform, and as the PS3 showed, they can just as easily take it away, should they either decide to become hostile at a future date, or should they decide to not bother with the extra maintenance burden required to make it viable.
19:00:50 <waltercool> yeah, but their areas don't talk properly each other. Reason why for multiple years their phones had crappy cameras, but Samsung/Apple had good Sony cameras lol
19:01:10 <TheJollyRoger> Google has been extremely helpful and forthcoming with vendor support for running operating systems that aren't their own, on their devices.
19:01:38 <TheJollyRoger> Other vendors have not been anywhere near this level of support, or have even been hostile to it.
19:01:51 <waltercool> I won't give money to Google, to be fair. I don't support their business model
19:02:55 <waltercool> they are nice in relative terms
19:03:48 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I can give you a bit of perspective on what it would take to fork and port GrapheneOS to another device, assuming you can find a device that supports full bootloader security features, with a non-vendor operating system.
19:03:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <u‚Äãlmirdin> Well, maybe if you support Google by spending money on their hardware, they will be less inclined to selling users data in the future.
19:04:16 <TheJollyRoger> waltercool: My estimate is that you would be looking at $100,000 per year, minimum.
19:04:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you can't do this yourself.
19:04:54 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, people who do know what it takes to get this stuff done, tend to work for Android OEMs and be paid six-figure salaries to do so.
19:05:26 <waltercool> I will check the build process, and see what can I do
19:05:31 <TheJollyRoger> You'd likely need at least one dev dedicated to full time support, specific to your chosen device, working for you full time.
19:05:32 <TheJollyRoger> Anything less,
19:05:54 <TheJollyRoger> and you're going to have to start cutting corners somewhere, and remember the old joke: "security is a cost."
19:06:44 <TheJollyRoger> So chances are, anything less than the diligence and knowledge of someone that's going to be able to demand a salary like that, and you're probably going to have to be cutting corners somewhere on doing things like implementing device specific workarounds/security hardening/exploit mitigations.
19:07:04 <wiegolf[m]> <waltercool "I won't give money to Google, to"> It was also not easy for me to buy a Google hardware product... but I am also a developer and understand the complexitvity of the bootloader and i do not regret my investment. In order to have a strong code foundation it benefits only to have one lineup: 3 3a, 4, 4a, 5 and future 5a, 6.....
19:07:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hey wiegolf[m], wow, that's awesome, glad to have you in the channel, then!
19:08:51 <waltercool> wiegolf[m]: I stopped using Google devices after JBQ thing, that's lot of time lol
19:12:05 <nogorono> ¬†in web installer ..Downloading bonito-factory-2021.03.30.02.zip... and then stucks error unandetified i have updated windows and chrome but i dont use oficial google pixel cable besause my laptop doesnt have sutch a port maybe this is the problem?
19:13:05 <wags> I envy the build quality of apple over the pixel, but i can see that improving eventually. (i hope)
19:14:18 <entry1[m]> <wags "I envy the build quality of appl"> Once you slap the case on, nothing matters much except the screen quality. Pixels are very underrated
19:14:28 <wags> cant think of better travel phones than the 4a or 4a 5g tho.. still has a headphone jack too so I don't have to use bluetooth in airports
19:14:50 <wags> fair point entry
19:15:41 <p0lp0> hey all. do i need to so anything special to get the Edge browser to discover my connected Pixel3?
19:16:41 <p0lp0> hm. wait, do i need this installed on my Windows machine first? https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
19:17:03 <southron[m]> Not for web install
19:17:25 <southron[m]> Windows update should get what you need
19:17:30 <wiegolf[m]> Back in february when I installed GrapheneOS I did not use the browser Installation tool
19:18:18 <p0lp0> it didn't seem to prompt me to install anything from windows update
19:18:52 <p0lp0> when i connect the phone in fastboot mode though it comes up as Unspecified in Devices and Printers
19:19:08 <p0lp0> when its booted normally it shows as a regular device
19:20:06 <p0lp0> the only optional updates i have are ancient drivers from 2016
19:21:15 <southron[m]> I would try different cables and/or USB ports if possible
19:21:19 <wags> that browser tool is so slick
19:21:28 <fom[m]> <p0lp0 "hey all. do i need to so anythin"> I don't think so. I mean, you will probably need to download Edge to your phone
19:21:51 <wags> def use the USB that came with the phone like others mentioned
19:21:52 <fom[m]> you don't really have to mind, but Edge is pretty a pretty good privacy violator
19:23:39 <p0lp0> i'll see if i can find it
19:23:44 <p0lp0> i've tried all the ports
19:25:44 <southron[m]> Have you tried using Chrome?
19:26:40 <pkgbuild[m]> download the drivers
19:29:32 <pkgbuild[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
19:31:50 <wiegolf[m]> You need the drivers
19:35:29 <p0lp0> thank you! that was the problem
19:35:39 <p0lp0> pkgbuild[m], i didn't have the drivers
19:38:29 <p0lp0> fom[m] what browser do you recommend?
19:39:41 <p0lp0> i noticed that we're at the point where I don't even ever have to sign in to YouTube (or install Chrome, or anything) for it to know who i am
19:39:48 <p0lp0> on a totally different computer
19:42:14 <p0lp0> open to all suggestions of course
19:42:37 <p0lp0> also does anybody know how / if Google Fiber is used in tracking personal data?
19:59:51 <fom[m]> <p0lp0 "i noticed that we're at the poin"> i would suggest Firefox, in the beginning its not the most privacy focused browser, but the thing is its very adjustable. for instance, in chromium based browsers you cant disable WebRTC without an extension, when firefox can just by going to about:config and changing it in seconds
19:59:58 <fom[m]> > <@freenode_p0lp0:matrix.org> i noticed that we're at the point where I don't even ever have to sign in to YouTube (or install Chrome, or anything) for it to know who i am

20:03:23 <strcat[m]> inaccurate
20:03:25 <strcat[m]> and off-topic
20:10:31 <wiegolf[m]> p0lp0: Google fiber will track everything
20:11:58 <strcat[m]> off-topic stuff needs to stop

20:23:35 <strcat> we don't have plans to develop a camera app

20:23:50 <strcat> you're welcome to contribute to one

20:28:15 <fom[m]> People can do it alone but its a nice gesture.
20:28:39 <strcat[m]> Google Camera isn't an open source app, so no, we can't
20:28:44 <strcat[m]> and hacking something together is not viable
20:28:53 <strcat[m]> it can break at any moment such as by depending on more of Play services
20:28:56 <strcat[m]> and isn't going to fully function
20:29:03 <strcat[m]> we can't support or include that for obvious reasons
20:29:23 <strcat[m]> just because some hack currently works does not mean it will keep working
20:29:59 <strcat[m]> this is not the kind of project that's going to rely on a temporary hacks where it's known it's going to stop working at some point and has serious drawbacks even before then
20:30:10 <strcat[m]> if you want Google Camera and similar features, I'd suggest using the stock OS
20:30:30 <strcat[m]> that's the only way you will ever have it reliably working long-term without serious flaws
20:31:58 <fom[m]> Of-course.
20:31:58 <fom[m]> But (correct me if im wrong) you (third-view) can't really use the full advantage of a camera without seeing the code behind it.
20:33:32 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what you mean
20:33:41 <strcat[m]> the camera works fine
20:33:46 <strcat[m]> all the OS support for the camera is present
20:33:49 <ComradeSkeltal> why is fom[m] sending the same 3 messages over and over
20:33:55 <strcat[m]> you just want a better app, which is not within the scope of GrapheneOS
20:34:15 <strcat[m]> as I said above, I suggest contributing to a camera app project
20:34:35 <strcat[m]> I explained why Google Camera is not a viable approach for an alternate OS particularly one without Play services
20:34:36 <fom[m]> So the photos from google camera and the stock one on Graphene is the same?
20:34:46 <strcat[m]> please read the response above
20:35:05 <strcat[m]> the OS support is the same
20:35:11 <strcat[m]> same app? same results on both
20:35:35 <strcat[m]> we are unlikely to make our own camera app
20:35:42 <strcat[m]> at most we would bundle a different one
20:36:02 <fom[m]> So what did you mean by taking full advantage of the camera hardware?
20:36:08 <fom[m]>  * So what did you mean by taking you can't get full advantage of the camera hardware?
20:36:17 <strcat[m]> so, you should be bringing this up to a project that makes a camera app
20:36:20 <strcat[m]> and putting in resources there
20:36:22 <strcat[m]> not here
20:36:22 <fom[m]>  * So what did you mean by you can't get full advantage of the camera hardware?
20:36:22 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS has the same OS support for the camera as the stock OS, it works the same
20:36:27 <strcat[m]> same app, same results
20:36:37 <strcat[m]> beyond that it's off-topic
20:36:42 <ComradeSkeltal> he'a doing it again. what's going on?
20:36:58 <strcat[m]> put resources into Open Camera if you want it to get better, or fork it, or make a more modern alternative
20:37:05 <strcat[m]> not something that involves GrapheneOS
20:37:12 <fom[m]> OK. Thanks for explainingüëçÔ∏è
20:37:16 <strcat[m]> unless there is a better alternative to bundle, it's not up to us
20:37:22 <strcat[m]> and I don't think there is
20:37:41 <sphinx[m]> <ComradeSkeltal "why is fom sending the same 3 me"> they are editing the message from Matrix which just sends the message again and again to IRC
20:37:49 <strcat[m]> there is a serious lack of people stepping up to work on stuff and making good apps, that is why there aren't better apps available for things like this
20:38:06 <strcat[m]> do not recommend relying on some temporary hacks to get Google Camera partly working
20:38:07 <side_land> But with all the goodness that grapheneOS has, do we really need to complain about the camera?
20:38:19 <strcat[m]> it's going to stop working repeatedly
20:38:21 <strcat[m]> and we cannot support it
20:38:30 <strcat[m]> they'll depend on more of Play services
20:38:39 <anupritaisno1> the camera is already good enough as it is
20:39:33 <side_land> Exactly
20:40:12 <ComradeSkeltal> ty sphinx, that's what I thought
20:41:39 <Thatcher[m]> As long as I can scan QR codes for 2fa purposes and such, the default camera app does everything I need.
20:44:15 <fom[m]> The stock Camera app lacks some features, like Night Sight
20:45:15 <fom[m]>  * The stock Camera app lacks some features, like Night Sight.
20:45:15 <fom[m]> Just was interested to know if there is plans about improving it.
20:45:27 <strcat> no, we aren't going to be making a camera app
20:45:29 <fom[m]>  * The stock Camera app lacks some features, like Night Sight.
20:45:30 <fom[m]> Just was interested to know if there are plans about improving it.
20:45:32 <strcat> because it doesn't need to be developed by us
20:45:44 <strcat> there is no advantage to us doing it
20:45:49 <strcat> rather than an external open source project
20:46:08 <strcat> if you provide us 100k and find 2 people to work on it we could do that but... why don't you just do that externally?
20:46:12 <strcat> why do we need to be involved?
20:46:14 <strcat> what's the advantage?
20:46:21 <fom[m]> Yes, I got that. Just was answering to those guys earlier.
20:46:43 <strcat> we'll happily bundle a better camera app, let us know when you've made one that's at least as private/secure as the standard one with a focus on minimalism/correctness
20:47:29 <fom[m]> No advantage, just was interested to know. If I would know how to make one I would, but unfortunately no.
20:48:01 <strcat> if there's no better option available, I see nothing for us to do
20:48:17 <strcat> we don't have infinite resources and we'll be spending most of our resources countering attacks on the project unfortunately
20:48:30 <strcat> we can't afford to develop random standalone apps not tied to the OS
20:48:58 <w9e2> quick question, how do i turn off auto updates?
20:49:10 <fom[m]> Of-course. I understand. Don't mind
20:49:20 <w9e2> i want to manually check for updates every once in a while, instead of auto check
20:50:25 <strcat> w9e2: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
20:50:34 <strcat> it's designed to do automatic updates, you can disable the app as a whole
20:50:48 <strcat> there isn't a toggle to specifically turn off automatic updates beyond disabling the updater
20:50:52 <strcat> not planned
20:51:23 <w9e2> so i would turn off the auto updater app, and then turn it back on when i want to check for updates?
20:54:05 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
20:55:34 <Thatcher[m]> I would leave it on though
21:01:14 <w9e2> i mostly an interested in dsiabling it for privacy reasons. do you know if its designed to protect privacy?
21:01:35 <w9e2> does it run uniformly throughout the day or only when the phone is in use?

21:18:55 <strcat[m]> if you're having an issue with Wi-Fi it's due to your Wi-Fi network / router
21:18:58 <philogy[m]> My Phone can't seem to connect to the internet properly via WiFi ever since the update. Other devices not running GrapheneOS work fine on the same network
21:19:12 <strcat[m]> very unlikely to have anything to do with the update
21:19:28 <strcat[m]> more likely your router is broken and rebooting + connecting again is what demonstrated that
21:19:45 <strcat[m]> there's no issue with Wi-Fi, it's not an issue others are having and there is nothing that will be done to change it
21:20:10 <strcat[m]> suggest checking if your router is broken copes badly with devices connecting with a new MAC each time
21:20:23 <strcat[m]> it's a network issue on your end
23:32:00 <philogy[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a network issue on your end"> Adjusted the settings so that it keeps the same MAC address every time, still the same issue. Definitely seems to be a GrapheneOS problem since my other devices have no problem whatsoever with the network.
23:34:59 <strcat[m]> it's not going to fix the router if it's already screwed up
23:35:04 <strcat[m]> philogy: it's not a GrapheneOS issue, it's a router issue
23:35:18 <strcat[m]> check the router configuration, check if it has bad handling of DHCP in the presence of MAC rand
23:45:35 <p0lp0> Wow. Have to say I really like this app
23:46:09 <p0lp0> I haven't gotten the sim card working yet but seems cool
