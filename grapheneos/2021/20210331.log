00:12:14 <ryanrambharose[7> can i disable sensors completly?
00:12:35 <ryanrambharose[7> completely*
00:21:00 <sphinx[m]> ryanrambharose: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210313#c7242451
00:22:20 <strcat[m]> ryanrambharose: I suggest not touching it for apps bundled with the OS
00:23:00 <strcat[m]> ryanrambharose: eventually we'll find someone to help us go through all the code for sensors API usage and set up marking which system apps need it so we can disable needing to assume that apps need it for the built-in components
00:23:14 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make much sense for each person to do that by hand
00:23:20 <strcat[m]> stick to worrying about permissions for user installed apps
03:55:38 <Eddy[m]> <smartycope "Well dang it. This sucks. I'm ju"> You can install adb and start removing google junk, disabling micro g, and installing f droid
03:56:25 <smartycope> I installed f droid. What's micro g?
03:56:34 <Eddy[m]> There's a neat little video on YouTube by a guy called CTT who shows how to do it
03:56:47 <smartycope> nice. I'll look into that.
03:56:57 <Eddy[m]> <smartycope "I installed f droid. What's micr"> Micro g is essentially a bunch of Google spyware that's in every android phone
03:57:28 <Eddy[m]> Graphene os by default removes all the Google junk
03:57:35 <Eddy[m]> Ur gonna have to so some work tho
03:57:45 <TheJollyRoger>  Eddy[m], with respect to Google junk:
03:58:06 <Eddy[m]> But watch out if you brick anythibg, you can't re install ROM since bootloader is locked so
03:58:07 <TheJollyRoger> The android open source project (AOSP) that serves as an upstream provider for GrapheneOS does not contain any Google junk.
03:58:28 <Eddy[m]> Tread carefully, only remove all the things you know you can for %100
03:58:46 <smartycope> noted
03:59:09 <TheJollyRoger> By default, AOSP is actually Google free. Google, as well as the other Android OEMs later adds their own proprietary play services to it and releases it with their handsets to comply with the Android compatibility specifications that Google publishes.
03:59:31 <Eddy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The android open source project "> OEM's also slap their spyware on the phones. Android is honestly a blessing and a curse. At least its Foss, which means we can fix it
04:00:20 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: yes, many OEMs that aren't Google also include their own stuff, often in exchange for kickbacks from other third-parties.
04:01:44 <Eddy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Eddy: yes, many OEMs that aren't"> smartycope remove those too if you can, for example of you have a Samsung phone grep for all the com.samsung stuff
04:02:02 <Eddy[m]> * smartycope remove those too if you can, for example if you have a Samsung phone grep for all the com.samsung stuff
04:02:11 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't topical to GrapheneOS, so I'll only touch on it here: Google's software includes Play Services. MicroG is an open-source handler for some certain, limited functions of Google Play, but it's been discovered via reverse engineering. Some other projects like it because they want some Google play functionality, but at GrapheneOS, the view held here is that Play Services are considered
04:02:13 <TheJollyRoger> invasive, and simply implementing them in an open source way, doesn't make that any less invasive.
04:02:54 <TheJollyRoger> Because MicroG must also countermand significant assumptions of the Android security model, GrapheneOS will never include it.
04:05:13 <TheJollyRoger> Non-GrapheneOS operating systems, handsets, and other hardware or software that's not topical to GrapheneOS aren't on-topic here, but I'll invite you to join #grapheneos-offtopic (Matrix users, for you that's #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org), which we set aside for discussions of those things provided they remain productive. ^_~
04:07:48 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org also points to the room
04:08:02 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Thanks, somenerd[m]

09:38:01 <oikos[m]> hi folks. I just acquired a pixel 5 for the specific purpose of installing grapheneOS on it. I'll try to use it as my daily driver. the only thing that could possibly be a bummer would be the impossibility of using my banking apps. anything else I should expect, either good or bad?
09:39:43 <pizzaeater69[m]> Banking apps usually work without googleplayservices (most of them anyways)
09:40:24 <oikos[m]> ah that's good to know. hopefully mine will
09:40:41 <oikos[m]> I thought they all implemented safetynet
10:14:43 <torpirate[m]> <oikos[m] "I thought they all implemented s"> It should pass it even without google play services because you can lock your bootloader.
10:15:29 <torpirate[m]> Atleast banking apps that i use never liked root or unlocked bootloader but now they work with grapheneos bootloader locked
10:19:12 <oikos[m]> oh, great! that was my biggest concern. I can live if other apps break, I try to  maximize my usage of fdroid apps anyway
11:42:28 <Hea> Hello I have a question, should I make a full backup of the system before installing GrapheneOS (Pixel 4a)? I know this from other Android Samrtphones e.g. to back up DRM keys.
11:43:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X‚Äãa_bi> Its not a sony phone, no backup needed other than personal data
11:52:01 <Hea> Thank you :)
11:57:23 <xytel87> There are any other phone besides pixel where I can flash custom rom and reloack bootloader?
12:01:20 <xytel87> *relock
12:23:44 <Pratyush[m]> <xytel87 "There are any other phone beside"> There is but no one maintain any rom for those devices. just for example oneplus device supported self signed rom in my knowledge (not 100% sure).
12:44:02 <xytel87> yes I saw one plus allows to flash avb_custom_key for some models

13:17:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X‚Äãa_bi> Op5 allows custom keys
13:18:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X‚Äãa_bi> Not so sure about how secure the bootloader is but there s an option for it
14:16:27 <benoliver999> Say I deleted an app by mistake, but I did a seedvault backup. How do I restore its data?
14:24:35 <akc3n[m]> <benoliver999 "Say I deleted an app by mistake,"> Hi benoliver999 I'd take a look at the issues on the seedvault github repo.
14:26:10 <polardroid> does the grapheneos keyboard save history ?
14:33:02 <benoliver999> akc3n[m]: Thanks. Looks like auto-restore might do it, I'll give it a spin
14:40:31 <benoliver999> Well I *think* it worked. Uninstalled app, reinstalled it with flash drive plugged in, settings are still there
14:40:43 <benoliver999> Tried it without pen drive, settings were not there
14:41:15 <benoliver999> It's a bit like those cars that lock when you walk away. Never quite feels like you can test it properly
15:59:28 <mefistofeles> hello, is there a way to get back to the factory OS image from the pixel phone? In case grapheneOS doesn't meet my needs?
16:02:19 <indianajonestheo> yes, see at the end of the page ;
16:02:19 <indianajonestheo> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
16:03:20 <mefistofeles> ah thanks, was trying to find that
16:04:30 <mefistofeles> indianajonestheo: oh, then the question is where to get the pixel stock os images?
16:05:20 <mefistofeles> https://developers.google.com/android/images
16:05:23 <mefistofeles> I guess that works

17:40:43 <reallynot[m]> I wanted to suggest a modification to the sound controls
17:41:21 <reallynot[m]> It'll be great if the call and notification sliders can be separate
17:41:52 <reallynot[m]> I like to keep sound on for calls but vibrate-only for notifications

17:44:04 <entry1[m]> reallynot  Already available. Standard AOSP functionality. Also not recommended to ping the lead developer for a question like that
17:44:10 <reallynot[m]> Oh sorry what I meant was ring volume
17:45:27 <reallynot[m]> And sorry for the ping

17:46:29 <entry1[m]> All good, it may be possible I'm thinking to add vibration for certain apps
17:46:53 <entry1[m]> Can't confirm until I get notifications though
17:48:26 <visla[m]> I just want to say thanks to the people who answer questions in here every day. It's above and beyond to help support this amazing project. Thank you.
17:52:19 <reallynot[m]> <entry1[m] "All good, it may be possible I'm"> Okay but can the ring and notification sliders be separated?
17:56:33 <entry1[m]> reallynot  Not to my knowledge. Possible to add "no sound" to certain apps it appears so you can have it vibrate only while the call will go off, but many apps don't breakout all their different types of notifications. That would most likely be an upstream issue for AOSP to see whether they'd like to add that in. Unsure if an issue already exists for it or a better work around.

18:03:37 <entry1[m]> reallynot  see if this works by changing your default notification sound to none and keeping your ringtone on
18:03:55 <entry1[m]> We'll move this to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  for future discussion
18:09:55 <reallynot[m]> The workaround worked. Thanks a lot
18:33:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Should system update > check for updates do something?
18:33:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> It lets me click it but nothing happens
18:44:57 <DrFastbuck> Newb here. Got a new Pixel 5 from Visible (Verizon). Is it still possible to load the GrapheneOS?
18:46:26 <entry1[m]> <DrFastbuck "Newb here. Got a new Pixel 5 fro"> As long as your phone has OEM unlocking available in settings, it will be able to run GrapheneOS. I have not heard people being able to use Visible successfully on GrapheneOS, but someone can correct me if they haven't experienced any issues with that carrier.
18:52:37 <grapheneos_user_> <DrFastbuck "Newb here. Got a new Pixel 5 fro"> Check if OEM unlocking is grayed out. If it is, you can't install GOS. Verizon phones tend to be locked but I don't know if the Visible line is different.
18:53:41 <grapheneos_user_> The safest option is to just get it factory unlocked straight from Google.
18:57:47 <Eddy[m]> All Verizon google phones do not allow the bootloader to be unlocked from what I heard
18:58:02 <Eddy[m]> Your safest option is getting the international version of the phone
18:58:30 <DrFastbuck> Thanks for the info. I was able to successfully unlock and relock the bootloader.
18:59:38 <Eddy[m]> Well, guess what I heard is not entirely true then
18:59:51 <Eddy[m]> Did you manage to install graphene
19:02:27 <Eddy[m]> I have a question, is the bootloader supposed to whine about the operating system that's being booted not being official or something
19:05:55 <sh4d0w_h34rt[m]> I've been trying off an on for over a month now to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a. Got to the point of installation after unlocking last night then got the Fastboot too old error. My system and tools are all up to date as is the phone. I've repeatedly replaced to fastboot and adb version with current but problem continues.
19:11:31 <dankovsky[m]> Hey everyone! Which usb c to a cable would you guys recommend? On the website it says that a high quality one is needed, but I‚Äôm unsure which one I should get? (They sell a Samsung one, would that be fine?)
19:15:19 <strcat[m]> the one that comes with the device is recommended (USB-C to USB-C) otherwise Apple, Google, Anker, etc. for a USB-A to USB-C cable are fine
19:15:42 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure how much faith I'd have in Samsung making a spec compliant one
19:15:51 <strcat[m]> they probably do make some good cables but also bad ones
19:16:06 <Eddy[m]> <strcat[m] "the one that comes with the devi"> Does cable length affect the time in which it takes to flash?
19:16:12 <dankovsky[m]> Thanks! My pc doesn‚Äôt have usb c to usb c. I‚Äôll check Apple then.
19:16:27 <strcat[m]> Eddy: unlikely but the cable's implemented USB spec certainly does
19:16:29 <dankovsky[m]> Glad I asked then, I‚Äôm buying the phone and cable tomorrow!
19:16:40 <dankovsky[m]> Thank you
19:16:57 <strcat[m]> Eddy: unless it's poorly implemented / overly long for how they implemented it that shouldn't matter much
19:17:11 <Eddy[m]> <strcat[m] "Eddy: unlikely but the cable's i"> Aight, cuz personally I've had some issues with the USB cable I used so
19:17:17 <strcat[m]> there isn't going to be a difference between a high quality 10cm cable and a 40cm one
19:17:26 <strcat[m]> Eddy: probably broken / non-spec-compliant then
19:17:34 <strcat[m]> > 50% of USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
19:17:40 <strcat[m]>  * \>
19:17:40 <strcat[m]> 50% of USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
19:17:44 <Eddy[m]> Also does anyone know of any theming apps for graphene, I.e custom themes/skins
19:17:51 <strcat[m]> not supported
19:18:04 <Eddy[m]> Unfortunate
19:18:09 <strcat[m]> there will be the built-in color scheme support but never third party ones
19:18:14 <Eddy[m]> What about custom icons?
19:18:14 <strcat[m]> that would break the security model
19:18:23 <strcat[m]> Eddy: you can use a different launcher
19:18:31 <strcat[m]> the System UI does not and will not support custom icons
19:18:36 <Eddy[m]> <strcat[m] "there will be the built-in color"> Where is it? Can't find it
19:18:37 <strcat[m]> and neither will the built-in launcher
19:18:47 <strcat[m]> Eddy: it's not currently exposed via the Settings app
19:18:51 <strcat[m]> it's intended to be exposed in the future
19:19:04 <strcat[m]> don't recommend using adb to use it in an unsupported way which may break
19:19:11 <strcat[m]> just wait for it to be supported
19:19:41 <sh4d0w_h34rt[m]> I've been trying off an on for over a month now to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a. Got to the point of installation after unlocking last night then got the Fastboot too old error. My system and tools are all up to date as is the phone. I've repeatedly replaced the fastboot and adb version with current but problem continues.
19:20:08 <strcat[m]> adb isn't used as part of the installation process
19:20:14 <strcat[m]> sounds like you have followed inaccurate third party guides
19:20:20 <Eddy[m]> <sh4d0w_h34rt[m] "I've been trying off an on for o"> Reinstall fasfboot?
19:20:31 <Eddy[m]> Use the official guide too.
19:20:45 <strcat[m]> sh4d0w_h34rt: if you aren't using https://grapheneos.org/install/web or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli that's the problem and we don't offer support for third party guides / approaches to installing here
19:20:47 <TheJollyRoger> sh4d0w_h34rt will need to uninstall any third-party fastboot he installed first and reboot the computer.
19:20:50 <strcat[m]> sh4d0w_h34rt: please use the official guide
19:21:04 <strcat[m]> sh4d0w_h34rt: stop following whatever unofficial guide you have followed
19:21:17 <strcat[m]> which had you use adb (not used by the GrapheneOS installation process) and had you install out-of-date tools
19:21:20 <TheJollyRoger> sh4d0w_h34rt[m]: If you're getting "fastboot too old" what the computer's telling you is "Stop! The version of fastboot you've downloaded could result in bootlooping or a brick."
19:21:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> sh4d0w_h34rt: It is probably a better ides to provide more detail on your issue, the errors, the hardware and software you are using and versions etc. rather than repeat the same question again.
19:21:39 <hypokeimenon[m]> In general.
19:21:42 <sh4d0w_h34rt[m]> I have and it's inaccurate or broken. About to say screw it and install something else.
19:21:52 <strcat[m]> please just start over with either https://grapheneos.org/install/web or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
19:21:56 <strcat[m]> sh4d0w_h34rt: it's not inaccurate or broken
19:22:20 <strcat[m]> sh4d0w_h34rt: please do not blame issues caused by not following the official guide on our documentation
19:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> sh4d0w_h34rt[m]: Can you tell me the output of "fastboot --version" please?
19:22:30 <strcat[m]> the official guides work well for most people
19:22:36 <sh4d0w_h34rt[m]> Screw it something else it is. Thanks for being as clear as mud.
19:22:38 <strcat[m]> and I think most people find the web installer to be quite easy to use
19:22:50 <TheJollyRoger> Oh well.
19:22:55 <Thatcher[m]> Troll
19:23:29 <strcat[m]> concern trolling is not an appropriate way of seeking help
19:23:55 <strcat[m]> if someone genuinely wants help and they seek it by doing that kind of thing, they'll get a ban instead of help
19:24:06 <strcat[m]> we aren't desperate for more users
19:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir.
19:24:24 <strcat[m]> if people don't respect the folks helping them and the project then I don't want them trying to get help here
19:24:42 <dankovsky[m]> That‚Äôs very understandable
19:25:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
19:26:16 <strcat[m]> they probably started with an unofficial guide, installed legacy fastboot, and were missing a step like setting `PATH` or were trying to use a new shell
19:26:27 <strcat[m]> would have been easy to resolve the issue or to use the web installer instead for a simpler approach
19:27:04 <TheJollyRoger> Guess TPU's gotta do everything the hard way.
19:27:08 <strcat[m]> it won't actually matter if you have legacy fastboot or some weird third party one if you actually follow the guide properly
19:27:21 <strcat[m]> because it puts the one it has you download at the front of PATH so it's found first
19:27:34 <strcat[m]> if it ends up finding the old one you don't have PATH set up properly
19:27:42 <strcat[m]> it's easier for people not familiar with CLI to use the web installer
19:27:46 <strcat[m]> which is why we recommend it
19:27:59 <strcat[m]> CLI guide works properly if you copy-paste each command with the device codename modified to the one you're using
19:28:11 <strcat[m]> but people are likely to mistype something, miss a command, etc.
19:28:19 <strcat[m]> we made the web installer for a reason
19:28:26 <Eddy[m]> BTW what's the whole thing with tmpfs warnings on the CLI install page
19:28:34 <Eddy[m]> What's the thing with that
19:28:53 <Eddy[m]> * What's the reasoning behind that
19:29:19 <strcat[m]> Eddy: fastboot CLI utility uses TMPDIR (falls back to /tmp when not set)
19:29:26 <strcat[m]> Eddy: /tmp is often tmpfs
19:30:09 <strcat[m]> tmpfs is backed by RAM/swap and by default is set to half the size of the physical RAM
19:30:26 <strcat[m]> so if you have 16GiB of RAM /tmp is generally an 8GiB tmpfs filesystem
19:30:38 <strcat[m]> it's easy for that to get filled with cruft from other applications or simply be too small to hold stuff
19:30:58 <strcat[m]> it's a pretty bad design since at least without swap anything apps randomly decide to put in there is stuck in RAM until they delete it if ever
19:31:21 <strcat[m]> it's world writable, anything can stick stuff in there
19:31:29 <strcat[m]> really bad design, really
19:32:10 <strcat[m]> a lot of stuff also uses it insecurely rather than proper secure approaches to creating and using files there without races, since it's world writable, stuff has to be designed to cope with malicious stuff doing attacks through it
19:32:55 <m2tu[m]> do we know how many grapheneos users are there ? i feel it grows in popularity more and more last 2 years
19:34:38 <strcat[m]> m2tu: well the project was only renamed to GrapheneOS in 2019, it had different names before that
19:34:46 <strcat[m]> and unfortunately due to the events that happened we lost a lot of the momentum from earlier
19:34:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/history
19:35:00 <torpirate[m]> Eh how do i update to latest grapheneos?
19:35:21 <strcat[m]> torpirate: updates automatically, see https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases and https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
19:35:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Do fabric-locked bootloaders automatically lock themselves when the stock ROM updates?
19:35:33 <strcat[m]> check the releases page to see the latest version in the release channel (stable or beta) that you're using
19:35:40 <torpirate[m]> <strcat[m] "torpirate: updates automatically"> Alright thank yoj
19:35:46 <torpirate[m]> You*
19:35:55 <strcat[m]> releases go through internal testing -> Beta -> Stable
19:36:03 <strcat[m]> a release is announced right before it's pushed out via Beta
19:36:18 <strcat[m]> so that the changelog is available when the update is available
19:36:21 <strcat[m]> it'
19:36:30 <strcat[m]>  * it's not announced after pushing it out via Beta
19:36:47 <m2tu[m]> strcat: yeah sadly for what happent.. but i think better it did that time earlier than later.. those guys was dangerous ones fro the project and just thought about money.
19:36:55 <strcat[m]> and sometimes releases are in Beta for 3-4 days for non-security releases like the most recent one
19:37:13 <strcat[m]> m2tu: well, early on, it did well, but the company screwed things up over time
19:37:26 <strcat[m]> m2tu: things are finally rebuilt now
19:37:36 <strcat[m]> it took time to properly revive the project and in some ways that's not fully completed
19:37:52 <strcat[m]> the site is still missing tons of old content, there are still past features that need to be ported to most recent major version, etc.
19:40:15 <m2tu[m]> strcat: i see must been very hard to rebegin. I really hope this project will keep going and growing.
19:40:31 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: er, when you get the chance, let me know about my inquiry, please?
20:05:56 <Eckoko> Hello everyone, I'm discovering GrapheneOS right now on a pixel 4a, loving it so fat but i'm just sad for one thing : the styling options from AOSP are missing, is there any reason for this ? Just missing my colors haha
20:14:17 <strcat[m]> Eckoko: those aren't set up by AOSP
20:14:28 <strcat[m]> Eckoko: it isn't implemented because no one has done the work to set it up and AOSP doesn't do that
20:14:39 <strcat[m]> you're mistaken that the feature is present in AOSP
20:14:49 <strcat[m]> rather, AOSP provides what's necessary to offer it, but doesn't offer it
20:28:01 <Eckoko> Ah ok, thought it was AOSP since it's on default pixel rom and lineage. Saw an issue relating this on github, saying there wasn't enough hands on the project to focus on this kind of questions. Well thank you, hope more hands come to help !
20:29:08 <nscnt[m]> the stock OS on Pixels isn't AOSP
20:31:25 <nscnt[m]> many changes on the stock OS
20:39:37 <strcat[m]> Eckoko: well, as I said, AOSP provides what's necessary for it, but AOSP does not have that feature set up / enabled
21:26:26 <zagebo[m]> i have a carrier device. am i boned? any tips for unlocking?
21:27:57 <Thatcher[m]> zagebo ü¶¥'d
21:28:40 <zagebo[m]> :(
21:45:44 <strcat[m]> zagebo: which carrier
21:45:51 <strcat[m]> zagebo: Verizon ones are permanently locked
21:46:00 <strcat[m]> for others you can generally get carrier to remove the locking
21:47:03 <zagebo[m]> ATT

21:48:59 <zagebo[m]> 4a 5G, idk what relevant info is
21:49:42 <zagebo[m]> would it just be the general customer support line?
21:50:30 <strcat[m]> are you sure it's locked? that sounds odd
21:50:39 <strcat[m]> zagebo: yeah guess so
21:50:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Did you attempt to unlock the bootloader already by connecting to the Internet, enabling developer mode and taking a look at the "Unlock OEM" setting?
21:51:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> zagebo[m]: If it is grayed out, it is useless doing it all by yourself.
21:51:52 <zagebo[m]> yeah the oem unlocking option is greyed out
21:53:13 <zagebo[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<gochoingles> zagebo: If it is g"> do u mean its not worth trying to install graphene or useless to proceed without getting the carrier to unlok it
21:53:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Try getting the carrier to unlock it for you. If that does not work, ü¶¥d.
21:53:27 <zagebo[m]> thanks
21:54:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> <zagebo[m]: do u mean its not worth trying to install graphene> It isn't just not worth it, you just can not install GrapheneOS without unlocking the bootloader ‚îÄ that is the only way you can install virtually any OS that is not the stock.
21:55:26 <dazinism> zagebo: were you connected to internet?
21:55:34 <dazinism> Was the phone?
22:01:30 <zagebo[m]> it was connected to wifi

22:01:49 <zagebo[m]> shitty on purpose out of spite
23:15:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> You should either have the seller let you check the device before buying or get it from the Google Store ‚îÄ the guys at Google are more clear about what is OEM locked and what is not.
23:16:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> zagebo[m]: Replying.
23:17:21 <zagebo[m]> already have the phone oops will keep in mind for next time i guess
23:17:29 <zagebo[m]> planned obsolescence is a bitch
23:50:29 <m2tu[m]> does anyone know why if i disable sdcardfs , and restart the phone i cant select any ringtone anymore.. the sounds app in settigns become also slow and crashes?
23:54:51 <iceman4455> Anyone hear about this new android third party repo attack? My one question is am I safe?
23:56:51 <iceman4455> Here's a link https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-android-malware-hides-as-a-system-update-app-to-spy-on-you/
23:58:31 <TheJollyRoger> iceman4455: you're safe, as long as you don't go downloading it and installing it yourself, then granting it permissions.
23:59:50 <iceman4455> And to verify, on the pixel 3a there was an update over the weekend?
