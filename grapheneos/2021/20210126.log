00:03:49 <Essjay[m]> Just use the built-in profiles. No need for shelter
00:04:15 <FreeWillie> Thanks Essjay! even better.
00:05:57 <Essjay[m]> Profiles are securely isolated from each other.
00:06:22 <Thatcher[m]> For the device attestation service, is verification interval once a day sufficient? Or should  i leave it at the default every 4 hours?
00:07:02 <Essjay[m]> You can find more info here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
00:09:43 <Essjay[m]> <Thatcher[m] "For the device attestation servi"> I always side with leaving things default. Daniel and team put a lot of thought in their decisions. Is every 4 hours causing you a problem?
00:23:13 <FreeWillie> Thanks for the link Essjay - explains it well.
00:27:18 <Thatcher[m]> Does the Auditor app require unrestricted background data and battery use for the attestation service to verify the system?
00:36:40 <Essjay[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Does the Auditor app require unr"> I would start here : https://attestation.app/about
00:45:12 <Thatcher[m]> I will answer my own question from above: Auditor and Attestation communicate with each other via network, so the Auditor app must have unrestricted access to the network and also unrestricted background battery usage. Correct me if I am wrong!
00:46:06 <Thatcher[m]> In other words, the attestation service cannot verify my device if I deny Auditor app of Network privilege
00:50:07 <Thatcher[m]> I know I don't need to state the obvious here, but I'm trying to wrap my dumbass brain around this fascinating technology and feel good about myself for properly understanding it.
01:05:01 <amtec> Hi, I need to remove not disable a default app. Is this possible?
01:12:51 <Essjay[m]> <amtec "Hi, I need to remove not disable"> There is no simple way. What are you trying to remove and why?
01:13:34 <amtec> I'm attempting to dumb my phone down. If needed I will reinstall a default android is but wanted to see how I  might go in graphene
01:13:45 <amtec> Namely would be removing default browser
01:16:02 <Essjay[m]> You want to remove vanadium? Why? It's specifically built for Graphene by the Graphene team. Kind of defeats the purpose of going with Graphene in my opinion
01:17:02 <amtec> I wouldn't be using a browser on the phone. Only maps, notes, signal
01:17:22 <amtec> And some other default applications.
01:18:58 <Essjay[m]> What's wrong with disabling it?
01:19:28 <Essjay[m]> This is becoming and off topic conversation BTW. Might want to move it to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
01:20:13 <amtec> Hey that's OK. It seems like there is no simple answer to my question so I'll revert back to a default is and go from there.
01:21:01 <Essjay[m]> * This is becoming an off topic conversation BTW. Might want to move it to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
01:21:03 <amtec> And just lastly to answer your question, I would re enable it at certain times and am looking to remove that option
01:22:04 <strcat[m]> amtec: you can disable the Vanadium browser app
01:22:15 <strcat[m]> you should leave the Vanadium library and WebView enabled so apps still work
01:22:28 <strcat[m]> amtec: you can't modify the OS - there is verified boot
01:22:38 <strcat[m]> without building and signing your own releases at least
01:22:58 <strcat[m]> the stock OS has Chrome built in so what you're saying doesn't really make much sense
01:23:17 <Essjay[m]> Can he create a limited profile where the account using that profile can't re-enable a disabled app?
01:23:17 <amtec> OK thank you for the response. Sorry for going off topic. I'll come back to graphene once my impulse control is better
01:23:36 <strcat[m]> the stock OS has Chrome built-in
01:23:39 <strcat[m]> don't really understand
01:23:57 <strcat[m]> what's wrong with just disabling the app if you aren't going to use it?
01:26:08 <amtec> On stock os I can use tools to remove default applications. Just disabling the app has to do with impulse control. I cab disable it then re enable it a week later when I need it and im looking to remove that option so I can step into a different way of living
01:34:46 <nullnode[m]> <amtec "On stock os I can use tools to r"> But... Internet... Smartphone.... Why not just go without then and get a landline?
01:35:18 <nullnode[m]> You're gonna at least need the webview for most apps to even work.
01:35:44 <amtec> I feel like people are asking a lot of questions. I am happy to answer if you like but it is off topic to my original question
01:36:01 <nullnode[m]> Sorry
01:36:31 <nullnode[m]> Only way to get a build without the browser would be to compile the whole project without the packages.
01:37:10 <amtec> OK thank you. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the responses everyone
02:13:15 <Br1003> Hello everyone! quick question. I have a pixel 4a and Verizon am I able to wifi call? I have wifi call on and airplane mode on with my wifi but it says I need to turn off airplane mode off or connect to a wireless network?
02:36:03 <countermeasure> I've read this which talks about stingrays downgrading connections to 2G to exploit security flaws in 2G:
02:36:07 <countermeasure> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/your-phone-vulnerable-because-2g-it-doesnt-have-be
02:36:49 <countermeasure> And this seems to talk about disabling 2G/3G:
02:36:52 <countermeasure> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
02:37:10 <rny> dont even have umts on pixel 3 anymore
02:38:22 <rny> *gsm
02:38:52 <countermeasure> The options in my "Preferred network type" menu are "4G (recommended)", "4G only" and "3G".
02:39:47 <countermeasure> Does that mean that my phone (Pixel 3a) can't ever connect by 2G anyway?
02:40:02 <countermeasure> So I shouldn't be worried?
02:40:42 <rny> the pixel radio has a limited set of frequency bands
02:41:50 <rny> and depending on where you reside, cellular providers in your country might already have stopped GSM service provision
02:43:13 <rny> for example, in australia, GSM/2G services have completely shut down
02:43:22 <rny> 3G is due to shut down by 2024
02:43:41 <rny> those frequency bands are being reprovisioned for other services
02:44:05 <countermeasure> rny: I'm thinking of stingrays, not network providers.
02:44:25 <rny> cant stop ham radio from causing harm also, so (shrugs)
02:44:34 <rny> just use LTE only then
02:45:01 <countermeasure> rny: What I mean is, could a stingray force my Pixel 3a to downgrade to 2G?
02:45:13 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: so can a thick wall.
02:45:27 <rny> not if you use LTE only
02:46:33 <countermeasure> TheJollyRoger: So I should add thick walls into my risk matrix? ;)
02:47:41 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: no, what I'm saying is that cellphone reception can drop or downgrade for entirely innocent reasons: if you walk out of line of sight from a tower it will usually downgrade. This tends to be why hilly terrain and cellphones don't mix well.
02:47:56 <countermeasure> rny: How do I ensure I only use LTE?
02:48:08 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: GrapheneOS adds a setting for it.
02:48:25 <TheJollyRoger> Note though that this does NOT increase trust in the network - for that, you need to use TLS, because that's what TLS was designed to do.
02:48:54 <countermeasure> TheJollyRoger: Hmm, you've still got me worried about those thick walls. The sound menacing :)
02:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee
02:50:05 <countermeasure> TheJollyRoger: Where's the LTE-only setting you mention?
02:51:01 <rny> network > preferred network type > 4G ONLY
02:51:03 <rny> zzz
02:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> Settings -> Network and Internet -> Mobile Network -> Preferred Network Type
02:51:29 <TheJollyRoger> Set for "LTE Only."
02:52:04 <countermeasure> Thanks. My options in the "Preferred network type" menu are "4G (recommended)", "4G only" and "3G".
02:52:26 <rny> 4G only
02:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, yes, 4G only.
02:52:34 <countermeasure> The "4G (recommended)" is selected, so I guess it's the default.
02:52:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, since not everyone has reliable access to 4G.
02:52:51 <rny> not everyone lives in a 1st world country
02:53:02 <countermeasure> What's the diff between "4G (recommended)" and "4G only"?
02:53:23 <pixeluser> Better security with 4g only
02:53:28 <rny> countermeasure: 4g (recommended) allows downgrade where 4g is not available
02:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> Where I am, if I get in my car, pick a random direction, and drive for around an hour and a half on a good day, 4G drops out because there's no towers out there.
02:54:07 <rny> 4g only, you will lose connectivty if there arent 4g reception
02:54:13 <rny> even if there is 3g reception
02:54:16 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: wheras 4G Only will instead say "Nope, no reception at all" if it doesn't find anything else.
02:54:29 <TheJollyRoger> Beat me to it. :P.
02:54:36 <countermeasure> Aha, I'm beginning to understand.
02:54:38 <pixeluser> It protects you against some old school attacks on 2g 3g where someone can intercept your calls
02:54:48 * rny closes helpdesk
02:55:10 <countermeasure> So will "4G (recommended)" allow downgrading all the way to 2G?
02:55:24 <pixeluser> Yes
02:55:55 <countermeasure> Now it all makes sense to me.
02:56:30 <countermeasure> I didn't see any explicit references in that menu to 2G, so I wasn't sure where it fitted in until now.
02:56:39 <countermeasure> Thanks everyone:)
02:57:31 <countermeasure> ---
02:57:50 <pixeluser> I would be interested in what apps everyone is using on grapheneos if you want to meet me on the off-topic channel, as I've found an excellent app I didn't know existed
02:58:16 <countermeasure> And on a different yet related note, has anyone had any experience using stingray detection apps like SnoopSnitch?
03:01:36 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: they don't work.
03:02:22 <TheJollyRoger> countermeasure: if stingrays are in your threat model, you should be ensuring that your apps, and the communications you use, use TLS/SSL.
03:02:34 <TheJollyRoger> With strict certificate validation enforced and no fallback to plaintext.
03:02:50 <TheJollyRoger> And avoid calls via the publicly switched telephone network, using an encrypted messaging system.
03:03:22 <countermeasure> TheJollyRoger: You know, I thought that would probably be the answer :)
03:03:24 <countermeasure> Thanks!
03:03:32 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, yep.
03:03:52 <TheJollyRoger> TLSv1.3 was designed to assume that the network is hostile and is designed to deter even active adversaries on the network, so that's what your best vector is, even if your adversary decides to monitor you at the service provider.
03:03:59 <TheJollyRoger> Now...
03:04:18 <TheJollyRoger> if the *remote server* you're connecting to needs to be distrusted, there's little I can help you with there realistically except tell you to use an end-to-end encrypted messaging system.
03:04:50 <countermeasure> Yep, copy that :)
03:06:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. TLS v1.3, try to avoid STARTTLS unless you're sure that your client and server is enforcing certificate validation.
03:07:09 <TheJollyRoger> But the good news is that virtually everything uses TLS nowadays, so you're pretty safe.
03:09:11 <pixeluser> How do I make sure my apps are using TLS/SSL
03:09:48 <TheJollyRoger> pixeluser: usually the only apps I've seen that aren't, are the ones that give you the opportunity to turn it off entirely, such as mail clients.
03:10:22 <Br1003> does anyone have a pixel 4a and verizon? If so are you able to make wifi calls?
03:10:49 <Br1003> I made them when i had an iphone but its not working now
03:11:26 <pixeluser> Don't think it works on that network buddy
03:11:32 <Br1003> ok
03:11:38 <Br1003> good to know
03:11:52 <Br1003> going crazy here trying to get it to work
03:11:56 <Br1003> thanks

04:39:18 <faxing[m]> entry1 wasn't one that was spamming
04:39:19 <faxing[m]> lol
04:39:34 <faxing[m]> if we keep talking then they'll just be scrolled off and it won't be a problem
04:39:41 <faxing[m]> it worked perfectly on my desktop though
04:39:48 <faxing[m]> no delay whatsoever
04:39:55 <faxing[m]> same on my graphene 3axl
04:40:16 <Essjay[m]> Didn't work for me either.
04:40:48 <somerand0m[m]> Ah thanks. I was doing it hastily and thought I clicked the right people.
04:41:47 <faxing[m]> <somerand0m[m] "Ah thanks. I was doing it hastil"> Yeah I almost blocked him as well
04:41:53 <faxing[m]> oh

04:44:18 <faxing[m]> o ok
04:44:23 <deappledapple> Oh sorry, i mistaken his pic
04:45:50 <Essjay[m]> Looks like @somerand0m also got banned. He wasn't spamming either
04:46:31 <faxing[m]> No I think he just left

04:50:30 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
04:50:47 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome back guys!
04:51:00 <faxing[m]> Welcome back!
04:51:59 <deappledapple> Welcome back ^^
04:52:23 <take_a_deep_brea> welcome back ;-)
04:53:26 <deappledapple> <entry1[m] "20210125_231013_9164159628351881"> Not sure how this happened, on what phone this happened?
04:55:35 <deappledapple> <entry1[m] "Stuck on this on a Pixel 4a. Fla"> Are you sure that is not 4a 5G phone?
05:01:50 <deappledapple> It looks the similar issue to flashing sunfish images into bramble phone. Can you reboot to bootloader?
05:01:53 <deappledapple> Or is it pitch black?
05:03:08 <entry1[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: that's correct. Not a 5g model. I will try on a different computer tomorrow with a different USB cable. So dumb that the pixel has to come with a USB C to C instead of B to C
05:03:25 <entry1[m]> Just never had an issue with the cable in the past and have the OS updated too
05:03:41 <strcat[m]> you don't want B
05:03:49 <strcat[m]> C to C is a lot more useful than A to C these days
05:04:03 <strcat[m]> once we finish the web installer you'll also be able to flash one phone from another
05:04:14 <entry1[m]> Pardon me, I meant USB A to C
05:09:29 <entry1[m]> Very cool. I've done a bunch on the 3a without issue and love it. Will be donating more as well for everyone's hard work. Just was making sure I wasnt doing something dumb. Its nice having C to C for new computers and to set a standard, but I don't have machines with USB C ports atm. I will update tomorrow for anyone else who searches that issue as I tried to look at other suggestions. Goodnight everyone.
05:24:23 <iam_shadow[m]> hey so I have usb debugging on, bootloader unlocked already when I click on flash all.bat fastboot is not recognized.  Nothing happens cmd screen pops up and instantly goes away.  I'm using pixel 4a and  adb devices recognizes me when my phone is on android OS just not when I'm in bootloader I tried 3 different usb to C cables and wont have access to the original cable for another 6 hours so if you think thats it
05:24:23 <iam_shadow[m]> ill wait to trouble shoot till then. Thanks in advance  first time using this chat and first time installing roms in 7 years.
05:29:09 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to enable USB debugging
05:29:18 <strcat[m]> and you aren't supposed to click that script at any point
05:29:25 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
05:29:39 <strcat[m]> adb isn't used as part of the installation process
05:33:01 <iam_shadow[m]> ok was I watched three different youtube videos and one of them was recent and he had the 4a as well I followed along as best I could with the guide ill read again and slow it down. thanks for the advice
05:35:07 <strcat> don't follow unofficial guides
05:35:14 <strcat> they're largely inaccurate, dangerous and out-of-date
05:35:28 <strcat> if they were clicking flash-all.bat, that guide is incorrect
05:38:35 <strcat[m]> once the web installer is finished (support for all devices and robust enough) we'll start doing what we can to get those videos taken down
05:39:23 <strcat[m]> they should either update them to use the official CLI guide, the web installer or take them down
05:40:13 <strcat[m]> never should have had the situation where people were posting unofficial guides inventing their own installation approach and recommending running third party tools, etc.
05:40:57 <strcat[m]> has caused substantial harm: lots of confused users, bricked devices, countless hours of time spent resolving issues caused by people following them, etc.
05:41:33 <strcat[m]> development work specifically to add more checks to detect mistakes in those unofficial guides (like using some weird third party fastboot that bricks devices)
05:43:59 <strcat[m]> please undo anything you've done based on unofficial guides and follow https://grapheneos.org/install
05:44:11 <strcat[m]> otherwise contact the authors of the unofficial guides and ask them for help or to correct their videos
05:44:14 <strcat[m]> maybe do that anyway
05:46:23 <iam_shadow[m]> yea luckily I'm in good shape no major harm my data wiped from phone but that was expected and I have unlocked bootloader is all but I can still boot up android.
06:21:23 <a24678247> Hello, is there a way to download F-Droid on multiple user profiles? For some reason, I am unable to download F-Droid via the apk on another user profile after having installed it an updated it on a different profile
06:22:54 <strcat[m]> you can't install an older version of an app in another profile
06:23:08 <strcat[m]> that's what's happening because F-Droid has an outdated apk as the main download on their site
06:23:27 <strcat[m]> recommend reporting it to them and explaining that this is a usability issue for people using profiles
06:24:00 <a24678247> strcat[m], I really appreciate your dedication to GrapheneOS. You've been here every time I've come to this channel. Thanks for everything you and the team do
06:24:02 <a24678247> I will let them know
06:24:38 <strcat[m]> browse packages on their site and get the latest version of it from the normal package page
06:24:42 <strcat[m]> ignore their main download link
06:28:42 <a24678247> That worked without a problem, thank you

09:09:08 <bentley> however, i can't find any way to tell graphene to use a usb microphone
09:09:22 <bentley> does that work?
09:10:11 <bentley> the mic is a snowball which is afaik standard usb audio

13:46:43 <fdroid-gpg-check> Hi. First time here and new to grapheneos. How can I verify fdroid's GPG signature for its APK (both available under f-droid.org) on grapheneos before installing? Thanks!!
13:48:22 <deappledapple> Can verify sha256 cert by apps_packages Info
13:48:28 <deappledapple> As listed on https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#App_stores
13:48:45 <deappledapple> For gpg not sure
13:49:00 <somenerd[m]> also you kinda have to know that the gpg is lefit
13:49:04 <somenerd[m]>  * also you kinda have to know that the gpg is legit
13:49:23 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Can verify sha256 cert by apps_p"> This is crucial due to Android pinning this cert when updating the app
13:49:46 <deappledapple> <somenerd[m] "also you kinda have to know that"> Any way to do that? Not sure how
13:50:06 <deappledapple> ...without desktops
13:50:21 <fdroid-gpg-check> Let me ask the quetion differently. When you have a brand new GrapheneOS install, how do you install a VERIFIED Fdroid apk?
13:50:34 <somenerd[m]> go to the official site
13:50:44 <somenerd[m]> and mostly trust https
13:51:18 <somenerd[m]> if you expect an https mitm, you also have to check that the GPG you verified it legit
13:51:32 <somenerd[m]> rather than a fake one
13:52:16 <somenerd[m]> (again, you can't use the site's GPG because you expect it to be compromised)
13:53:55 <fdroid-gpg-check> https is one thing. I'd like a stronger mecanism. That's why fdroid gives a pgp signature for the apk on its homepage. They dont explain how to use it though. I know perfectly how to verify with pgp on a pc but I am really new to android.
13:54:26 <somenerd[m]> yeah but the PGP could also be replaced
13:54:27 <fdroid-gpg-check> I suggest we do not begin a conversation on the benefits of GPG vs https ;-))
13:54:46 <somenerd[m]> no it's not a conversation
13:54:52 <take_a_deep_brea> fdroid-gpg-check:  i suggest you use aurora store.
13:54:57 <somenerd[m]> the signature itself also has to be verified
13:55:10 <somenerd[m]> so you still trust https
13:55:19 <jpds> fdroid-gpg-check: Then check it on your PC and copy the APK to your phone with USB
13:55:19 <deappledapple> Aurora Droid you mean?
13:55:26 <take_a_deep_brea> also this is pretty much off-topic so , #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
13:55:36 <take_a_deep_brea> please
13:55:50 <somenerd[m]> yeah it is
13:56:17 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic on freenode
13:56:29 <take_a_deep_brea> man i keep doing this lmao
13:58:07 <fdroid-gpg-check> @jpds I thought of the USB way. But I was wondering if it was the only option. Meaning: If I want to verify with PGP, do I have to go through a PC? There is no way with GrapheneOS only to "gpg verify"?
13:58:22 <jpds> fdroid-gpg-check: No, there isn't
13:59:37 <fdroid-gpg-check> jpds, Thanks!! That's exactly the info I was looking for!!
14:00:05 <deappledapple> Nice
14:00:07 <fdroid-gpg-check> I would have preferred another answer but that's irrelevant! ;-)
14:00:08 <somenerd[m]> > Any way to do that? Not sure how
14:00:09 <somenerd[m]> possibly check other sources?
14:00:18 <somenerd[m]> other signatures or places
14:00:31 <somenerd[m]>  * other signatures or places where something was signed
14:01:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't really support fdroid or pgp here
14:01:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are too many issues with that store and it's a security nightmare. PGP is also quite a flawed verification method
14:02:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> We use signinfy instead of PGP for a reason
14:02:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Go to the offtopic chat for such discussion. This chat is for grapheneos
14:02:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not for fdroid, PGP or any third party apps you have on
14:03:53 <fdroid-gpg-check> Well, you can't do that much with a new install of GrapheneOS without any application. I thought I was not off-topic asking how you guys installed your apps in a secure way on a system meant to be secure as GrapheneOS.
14:04:09 <somenerd[m]> it's a tangential topic
14:04:16 <somenerd[m]> not directly related
14:04:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> fdroid-gpg-check: our FAQ already covers this question
14:04:32 <fdroid-gpg-check> how really???
14:04:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have our own app store planned in the near future as well
14:04:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> fdroid-gpg-check: yes
14:04:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't make any recommendations on app stores
14:05:00 <take_a_deep_brea> fdroid-gpg-check: you are welcome to ask questions . this  room is meant for topics directly related to grapehenos so if you dont mind join the off-topic room
14:05:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> * We don't make any recommendations on app stores however
14:05:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> They are just examples
14:05:46 <fdroid-gpg-check> could you send me the link to the specific topic of the FAQ? Because I read them but did not find an answer
14:05:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> I personally use the aurora store

14:07:07 <take_a_deep_brea> nvm
14:53:21 <Nerve> Is it fine to ask an installation question here?
14:54:09 <take_a_deep_brea> this is the place
14:54:12 <take_a_deep_brea> for that
14:54:17 <take_a_deep_brea> dont hesitate
14:54:41 <Nerve> Okay, thanks
14:54:45 <Nerve> Trying to install on my Pixel 3a. Have it connected to my Manjaro PC. OEM unlocking enabled, bootloader unlocked, everything but flashing works. I can use "fastboot reboot-bootloader" just fine; even "fastboot devices" shows the correct serial number displayed on the bootloader. However, "fastboot flash bootloader bootloader_image.img" is
14:54:45 <Nerve> straight-up hanging. It does nothing. Terminal becomes unresponsive. Phone does not react.
14:55:17 <Nerve> Not sure what to do. Hope that latest Android update didn't brick this thing.
14:56:35 <take_a_deep_brea> no . the updates have nothing to do with any installation issues
14:56:36 <take_a_deep_brea> and pixels cant be bricked just like that so dont worry
14:57:19 <Nerve> Well, I mostly meant in terms of flashing capability. If there's a way around this, I'm all ears.
14:59:21 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve: the official guide works just fine . i think its an issue with the connection . are you using the cable that came with the device on a usb-C port ?
14:59:40 <Nerve> Yup
15:00:32 <Nerve> Well, it's not new, it's refurbished. Seems to have shipped with a third-party cable. Is there any reason other fastboot commands would work on a third-party cable but not flashing?
15:00:55 <take_a_deep_brea> check the usb-c port if you are not confident about its quality .
15:03:15 <Nerve> No issues with it as far as I can tell
15:03:39 <take_a_deep_brea> a poor connection will hold up against simple fastboot commands like reboot-bootloader . but for large data transfers like in when an OS image is being flashed a weak connection will start showing
15:04:35 <Nerve> I may have another cable around, let me see
15:04:49 <take_a_deep_brea> that is not necessary
15:04:54 <jin61> I fohnd the fix for fastboot
15:05:13 <take_a_deep_brea> the google cables are upto the standardss
15:05:14 <jin61> Is it that fastboot is too old?
15:05:53 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve: if you have followed the installation guide here : https://grapheneos.org/install word-to-word then you shouldnt be faced with anything else other than a hardware connection issue
15:06:26 <Nerve> I have been following it word-for-word. fastboot version is 30.0.5
15:06:46 <take_a_deep_brea> ok .
15:07:13 <jin61> I couldn't install Graphene no matter what I tried.....Then I modified the fastboot script and it installed normally
15:07:39 <take_a_deep_brea> jin61: yours maybe an edge case .
15:08:19 <take_a_deep_brea> that guide has worked on all sorts of devices , and its not really recommended to modify the script .
15:08:52 <deappledapple> Besides, Manjaro is not officially supported
15:09:17 <Nerve> "fastboot flash bootloader bootloader_image.img" is still hanging with a different cable.
15:09:23 <jin61> I followed the instructiins word for word and couldn't get it....It would just fail.
15:09:24 <Nerve> Manjaro is Arch, same packages.
15:09:25 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve: do you have access to  a windows system or a mac ?
15:09:42 <Nerve> Not at the moment
15:10:23 <jin61> It's up and running now. Graphene is much faster than I had read
15:10:28 <Nerve> I do have a second machine to try this from
15:10:31 <take_a_deep_brea> if you can lay hands on one you are better off trying to use them . i dont see why Manjaro would cause an issue
15:11:22 <take_a_deep_brea> seeing as fastboot worked for you already
15:12:05 <noobexterminator> Is CopperheadOS safer than GrapheneOS?
15:12:20 <somenerd[m]> CopperheadOS is a scam
15:12:29 <somenerd[m]> and is copying GrapheneOS code
15:13:07 <somenerd[m]> they also harass GrapheneOS devs
15:13:18 <somenerd[m]> and have attacked the community several times
15:13:36 <noobexterminator> Wtf
15:13:46 <noobexterminator> Bruh i didnt know that
15:13:52 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000:  https://grapheneos.org/#history
15:13:52 <noobexterminator> Thanks @somenerd
15:15:53 <gibsonk[m]> enjoying graphene so far, really fast.  im migrating from ios/apple services- next solution is replacing icloud.....
15:16:14 <Nerve> Same hanging behavior from "fastboot flash" on another machine. Laptop, also Manjaro.
15:16:32 <Nerve> fasboot devices and fastboot reboot-bootloader both still work fine
15:16:48 <deappledapple> <Nerve "Same hanging behavior from "fast"> Ummm
15:16:58 <deappledapple> Nowhere it says you do fastboot flash?
15:17:28 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Nowhere it says you do fastboot "> It's in the script already in ./flash-all.sh iirc
15:17:37 <take_a_deep_brea> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: i think they were reffering to terminal output
15:17:45 <deappledapple> Oh
15:17:57 <Nerve> I'm just referring to the fact that the actions the flash-all.sh script takes are all "fastboot flash". Done both ways, with the script or replicating the commands manually one by one, I get the same behavior.
15:18:32 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve: how do you replicate sleep commands ? in the script ?
15:18:43 <deappledapple> Does it say "<waiting for device>"
15:18:52 <deappledapple> * Does it say `<waiting for device>`
15:18:59 <take_a_deep_brea> please execute the script . as is .
15:19:03 <Nerve> Couldn't you replicate sleep commands by just...waiting? No, it does not say <waiting for device>
15:19:49 <deappledapple> Just hangs? Try un
15:19:58 <Nerve> Let me be clear before I continue getting attacked as if I'm continuing to run the commands one by one. I AM using the script.
15:20:13 <take_a_deep_brea> ok
15:20:15 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry
15:20:27 <Nerve> I have simply tested both methods to make sure it's "fastboot flash" that is exhibiting the hang behavior
15:20:33 <take_a_deep_brea> we dont mean to attack you or anything .
15:20:50 <deappledapple> Not really, just recommending the grapheneos.org/install (as it has been tested on the officially supported OS)
15:21:09 <Nerve> That is exactly the page I am referencing to the letter
15:21:27 <somenerd[m]> maybe Manjaro is the problem?
15:21:31 <Nerve> Let me repost my OP
15:21:36 <deappledapple> Try unplugging and replugging the usb?
15:22:04 <Nerve> Trying to install on my Pixel 3a. Have it connected to my Manjaro PC. OEM unlocking enabled, bootloader unlocked, everything but flashing works. I can use "fastboot reboot-bootloader" just fine; even "fastboot devices" shows the correct serial number displayed on the bootloader. However, the "fastboot flash bootloader bootloader_image.img" step of
15:22:04 <Nerve> flash-all.sh is straight-up hanging. It does nothing. Terminal becomes unresponsive. Phone does not react.
15:22:17 <Nerve> I've replugged many times. Same behavior
15:24:06 <Nerve> Should Secure boot be "PRODUCTION"?
15:24:06 <deappledapple> Not sure what else to advise than use the other official recommended OS
15:24:14 <deappledapple> <Nerve "Should Secure boot be "PRODUCTIO"> Yes
15:27:01 <Nerve> Solved: After killing the flash-all.sh job, that seems to terminate fastboot's connection. Re-running flash-all.sh displays <waiting for device>. While that was in the prompt, I unplugged and replugged, and it immediately flashed.
15:27:05 <Nerve> That is...bizarre.
15:27:43 <take_a_deep_brea> apparently fastboot is not a very reliable protocol
15:28:01 <deappledapple> It's weird
15:28:27 <take_a_deep_brea> i have heard strcat discuss this before
15:28:39 <take_a_deep_brea> *i have read
15:28:42 <deappledapple> It's on logbot
15:29:10 <take_a_deep_brea> yep . i dont expect it will look pretty if i typed fastboot
15:29:14 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
15:30:40 <Nerve> Took barely a minute or two to flash. Locked the bootloader, Graphene is loading just fine.
15:40:55 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve: sorry if i seemd hostile earlier . at any rate i will keep this fastboot issue in mind
15:41:25 <strcat[m]> fastboot depends on USB working properly
15:42:18 <Nerve> Sorry for being testy, I literally live in the terminal and tend to react poorly to being advised basic troubleshooting steps
15:42:31 <Nerve> But there's no way you guys can know that
15:44:39 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve:  its OK .
15:46:54 <take_a_deep_brea> Nerve: a lot of people come here after trying to flash using some  youtube video as a guide or some obsolete instructions that address non existent problems in the official guide .
15:47:11 <Nerve> Ah, I see
15:47:22 <somenerd[m]> yeah
15:47:31 <strcat[m]> the web installer will be ready for use soon
15:47:34 <noobexterminator> Somebody at graphene needs to make a video
15:47:35 <strcat[m]> and then we can tell people to use that
15:47:45 <strcat[m]> noobexterminator3000: no
15:47:47 <strcat[m]> not happening
15:47:51 <take_a_deep_brea> <noobexterminator "Somebody at graphene needs to ma"> videos are a clunky medium .
15:47:54 <strcat[m]> it's a bad format for it and ridiculously hard to maintain
15:47:59 <somenerd[m]> WebUSB is a lot cleaner
15:48:08 <strcat[m]> as you can see from all the people who made them not updating their videos or fixing mistakes in them
15:48:12 <strcat[m]> since they would have to make them again
15:48:15 <take_a_deep_brea> you have to make one more if you update the instructions
15:48:17 <strcat[m]> and avoid making any new mistakes
15:48:23 <somenerd[m]> > it's a bad format for it and ridiculously hard to maintain
15:48:23 <somenerd[m]> yeah also probably hard to redirect people to the newest version of the vid
15:48:32 <Nerve> Text guides are just far easier to maintain, and in a CLI context, follow
15:48:43 <strcat[m]> if someone can't follow the CLI guide, they should be using the WebUSB installer once it's ready
15:48:53 <snooopy> strcat[m]: oh, the web installer is not useable?
15:48:55 <strcat[m]> either way I don't see how a video can help
15:49:00 <strcat[m]> snooopy: it is usable
15:49:09 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work for most of the devices yet
15:49:26 <strcat[m]> it needs to gain support for userspace fastboot
15:49:36 <strcat[m]> and it needs support for reconnecting automatically to fastboot
15:49:40 <strcat[m]> after a reboot etc.
15:49:58 <strcat[m]> we say that it's experimental and doesn't work for most devices yet on the site
15:50:32 <strcat[m]> it will be ready soon enough and then it will be recommended as the normal approach
15:51:07 <strcat[m]> it's being worked on
15:51:10 <strcat[m]> help is welcome
15:54:10 <Nerve> Anyways thanks for the help, everything is working flawlessly!
15:55:25 <Nerve> Good luck with that buggy fastboot behavior. That's probably out of your hands, but ah well.
15:56:38 <snooopy> strcat[m]: ah, thx for clarification :)
15:59:20 <strcat[m]> fastboot isn't buggy
15:59:30 <strcat[m]> it depends on a reliable USB connection
15:59:37 <strcat[m]> USB is supposed to be a reliable protocol
15:59:47 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to be a digital connection that handles lossy links etc.
16:02:17 <take_a_deep_brea> i see .
16:14:31 <somenerd[m]> > Text guides are just far easier to maintain, and in a CLI context, follow
16:14:31 <somenerd[m]> true

16:21:54 <noobexterminator> Forget the Cinversstifstiin
16:22:35 <Chicomsstolemylu> Now this is definitely off topic
16:22:46 <somenerd[m]> no it's just trolling
16:23:44 <noobexterminator> <Chicomsstolemylu "Now this is definitely off topic"> What are we supposed to talk about tgen
16:24:14 <somenerd[m]> I'm quite convinced that this is a troll

16:24:44 <noobexterminator> Nah
16:26:26 <strcat[m]> noobexterminator3000: you're consistently doing what a concern troll would do
16:26:30 <strcat[m]> on 20 different occasions
16:26:34 <strcat[m]> most of your posts in either channel
16:27:42 <somenerd[m]> maybe one legit post
16:27:47 <noobexterminator> Do i ask dumb questions or what
16:27:51 <somenerd[m]> the rest is all trolling
16:27:51 <noobexterminator> Are they that dumb
16:28:04 <somenerd[m]> you asked one question
16:28:06 <somenerd[m]> that's it
16:29:08 <noobexterminator> Okay guys remember to lock the bootloader when your done flashing grapeheneOS either with the power keys and volume keys or through a Command
16:29:56 <noobexterminator> Use Vanadium or Fenecc
16:30:16 <noobexterminator> Dont use Telegram
16:30:37 <noobexterminator> Uninstall instagram facebook and delete all youre gmail accounts
16:31:04 <noobexterminator> And yes you can use a Gmail accoun Sudo anonymously
16:31:39 <noobexterminator> You just need google voice
16:31:57 <noobexterminator> Im pretty sure you can get temp numbers for like 89 cents
16:32:12 <noobexterminator> Use KeepassDX or Bitwarden
16:32:17 <somenerd[m]> stop
16:32:34 <noobexterminator> Slide as a Reddit alternative
16:33:21 <noobexterminator> Use GrapheneOS
16:33:25 <somenerd[m]>  * what?
16:47:34 <hypokeimenon[m]> Can you keep this in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  please
16:58:54 <noobexterminator> Ok

17:36:50 <charlie67j[m]> Greetings. I'm wondering if anyone has a good option for an NVMO that runs on AT&T or Verizon for use with GrapheneOS. I've been making the moves to reduce the footprint that we leave for my family and me. We have been GoogleFi subscribers for about two years and we now all have factory unlocked Pixel 3a XLs ready for GrapheneOS and and a mobile operator. I have a Visible Wireless SIM coming today to test with, but
17:36:50 <charlie67j[m]> I'm not committed in any way outside the month of testing .  After some reading here it looks like Visible may not be a good option. I appreciate any constructive guidance if at all possible.

We use Signal and Nextcloud Talk within our small groups, but due to signal issues on our farm, most phone calls go out over WiFi
17:46:03 <charlie67j[m]> currently.
17:46:09 <faxing[m]> solid recommendation
17:46:16 <mike-of-earth> cool, thx
17:48:04 <battery-horse-st> Hi everyone :]  I've just installed grapheneos on my pixel 3a today. It works really well. I've made a paypal donation by way of thanks. (y) I went to open.spotify.com to try and play some music. On visiting the site in vanadium, I receive a request to allow my "device's identity" to be verified by google. I guess this is some sort of DRM. I'm
17:48:04 <battery-horse-st> unsure of what is shared if I click allow. Can google identify who I am personally with this verification would you think? Apologies If this infringes on rule 2a.
17:48:33 <mike-of-earth> non-sequitor: When running Graphene, what's the safest way to pull apk's from the likes of play store? My trust in apkmirror is low, aurora store 'seems' better but it doesn't always work. I've used raccoon in the past and that worked well. Thoughts?
17:48:42 <faxing[m]> <charlie67j[m] "Greetings. I'm wondering if anyo"> I personally love mint mobile, though they're on tmobile, not att. Verizon is hard on Graphene. I used to have Visible, and I can tell you that it doesn't work (or at least it didn't in late september). While I can't really speak to any carriers other than mint for graphene, I've heard good things about the compatibility of RedPocket. Again, don't quote me on RedPocket,
17:48:42 <faxing[m]> I've just seen some people saying that it works for their att plan.

17:49:34 <faxing[m]>  * I personally love mint mobile, though they're on tmobile, not att. Verizon is hard on Graphene, including MVNOs - I think it's due to forced carrier bloat.

17:50:49 <charlie67j[m]> <faxing[m] "I personally love mint mobile, t"> Thanks! That's a place to start looking. My limited experience with GrapheneOS so far is outstanding. It almost seems a shame to ruin the experience with a mobile operator.
17:53:24 <faxing[m]> <charlie67j[m] "Thanks! That's a place to start "> No problem!  Yeah, I switched from an iPhone and have never looked back, Graphene is just amazing.  Exactly, I keep my sim out 99% of the time because there's WiFi almost everywhere anymore lol.
17:54:37 <faxing[m]> Oh also - I think I heard that Wing works. (again, don't quote me on it) They're a little more expensive but they have group saving, wifi calling, etc

17:59:29 <blk> charlie67j[m]: why AT&T or Verizon ?
18:00:05 <charlie67j[m]> They are the only towers close enough for signal to my farm.
18:00:44 <blk> OK. I was just curious because you said you were on Google Fi previously
18:02:22 <blk> FYI T-mobile seems to be one of the better US carriers for compatibility with native WiFi calling and Visual VM.
18:02:36 <charlie67j[m]> Like I mentioned, we have GoogleFi currently and use WiFi calling on the farm, no problem as I have the whole farm covered in Ubiquiti gear. Since googleFi uses T-Mobile/Sprint we have a poor experience. If you pinned my down, I would say that we could probably stay with one of those as well and continue to leverage the WiFi calling. The other thing to note is that our internet service is via LTE using a home brew
18:02:36 <charlie67j[m]> setup with an AT&T MVNO.
18:03:05 <blk> gotcha
18:03:57 <charlie67j[m]> No easy answer really. Maybe Starlink will be better when it becomes available...
18:04:27 <blk> RedPocket may be worth a shot. If WiFi calling didn't work at least you would have LTE
18:05:59 <blk> Mint mobile offers a 7 day trial as well if you wanted to test a T-mobile only MVNO
18:06:20 <charlie67j[m]> Worth the gamble I think. They don't want to make it too easy to break free.
18:07:42 <charlie67j[m]> It is the one nice thing about the GoogleFi service leveraging both T-mobile and Sprint. I'm not sure which of those actually has better coverage where I am. Obviously, I'm quite rural....
18:08:08 <blk> worth noting, those carriers are in the process of merging
18:08:45 <charlie67j[m]> Indeed.
18:10:33 <charlie67j[m]> Thanks for the info. I'll give both a try and see what sticks.
18:14:27 <blk> otherwise, maybe you can see if T-mobile will put a tower on your farm :-)
18:17:08 <blk> (I am also quite rural, and we wouldn't havre any cell signal at all if it wasn't for the tower lease on a negihbors farm land.)
18:32:59 <charlie67j[m]> <blk "otherwise, maybe you can see if "> We actually looked into it. We're far enough away that there was no interest. I had an idea to become my own WISP which would require putting up a tower to provide internet service to the surrounding area. Allot of work and red tape, but I was moving that direction. Then Musk announced the Beta for Starlink. That service has some real potential. I pushed pause on my plans
18:32:59 <charlie67j[m]> since it could very well be the end of the small WISP business model. We'll see....
18:41:03 <a24678247> Is there a way to disallow all permissions by default when an apk is installed? I currently install apps while on airplane mode as many are installing with network permissions by default
18:44:07 <take_a_deep_brea> a24678247: thats a nice move.but denying permissions by default is still not a thing in android
18:44:52 <take_a_deep_brea> you can always review app permissions though before starting the app for the first time .
18:46:10 <a24678247> Alright, I'll make sure to review permissions before starting the app. Is there any possibility of the app running without me starting it after being installed?
18:46:26 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont think so.
18:46:43 <a24678247> Thanks
18:46:53 <take_a_deep_brea> an app has to be started manually atleast on the first run
18:47:53 <take_a_deep_brea> you can review the app permission by searching for it on the play store web site or fdroid .
18:58:10 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath:  what do you mean? runtime permissions *are* disabled by default
18:58:23 <strcat[m]> why are you saying that it's not a thing?
18:58:50 <strcat[m]> when you install an app on Android, it doesn't have any dangerous permissions granted
18:59:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> a24678247: our official advice is to use separate user profiles
18:59:05 <strcat[m]> dangerous permissions have to be requested at runtime
18:59:14 <strcat[m]> they left the channel already
18:59:18 <strcat[m]> also I don't think that advice is relevant
18:59:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> When you grant a permission to an app you are basically giving it full trust to use that permission
18:59:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example let's say you grant the SMS permission to an app
19:00:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then that app can send an SMS on behalf of others by having other apps pass the message to it
19:00:14 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: Network and Sensors are permissions we've added, and they have to work differently than the standard ones
19:00:26 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: because apps do not know how to check for them and request them when needed
19:00:35 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: apps DO NOT get dangerous permissions granted at install time
19:00:50 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: you're confusing our Network and Sensors permission behavior with how standard permissions work
19:01:09 <take_a_deep_brea> ok .
19:01:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or some app with the contacts permission can share your contacts with other apps that don't have the permission
19:01:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the advice is ideally use separate profiles to isolate apps
19:01:46 <strcat[m]> yes but an app doesn't get those permissions (or any standard dangerous permissions) when you install it
19:01:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is our recommendation for high risk users
19:01:50 <strcat[m]> you have to explicitly grant it at runtime
19:01:55 <strcat[m]> and the question was about that
20:11:36 <Jimmal> donated twice this month...good luck with the trial my friend
20:16:59 <a24678247> What considerations do I need to take into account when connecting my phone with GrapheneOS to a Linux computer via MTP?
20:17:23 <a24678247> I'm getting issues that usually occur when phones are locked, however, my phone is unlocked. I have tried connecting to various unlocked user profiles with no luck
20:20:04 <a24678247> You know what, I think I may have solved the issue. I don't think I allowed file transfer on my phone
20:20:29 <a24678247> Yes, that was the issue.
20:30:39 <theychuckthisfro> In terms of Messaging apps, what's a good replacement to the one that comes on Graphene without being bloated?
20:31:19 <noobexterminator> Wdym
20:31:37 <a24678247> Do you mean for SMS or things like Messenger, Signal, WhatsApp?
20:31:42 <noobexterminator> use signal i guess but it has a phone number so that isnt so good
20:32:01 <a24678247> They're working on being able to sign up without a phone number
20:32:01 <noobexterminator> If you dont want to put a Phone number try Session
20:32:14 <noobexterminator> No way dude
20:32:22 <noobexterminator> Thats Amazing
20:32:51 <a24678247> I've heard it will be username/password
20:33:07 <a24678247> If you're concerned about privacy/anonymity, I recommend using a username that is completely unrelated to anything else you use or will use
20:33:31 <noobexterminator> Yeah if that happens im probably going to generate some random letters and words
20:33:37 <theychuckthisfro> For SMS.
20:34:07 <a24678247> As far as I know, if anything about signal is leaked, and someone somehow unhashes (or whatever the correct term is) your phone number, all they will know is that you use Signal
20:34:11 <theychuckthisfro> I use Session, but trying to get people to get on it is hard.
20:34:13 <a24678247> they won't have any conversation information or anything else
20:34:58 <theychuckthisfro> I'm using Signal right now just to replace the default Messages.
20:35:09 <a24678247> the default SMS messages?
20:35:13 <theychuckthisfro> * I'm using Signal right now just to replace the default Messaging app.
20:35:30 <a24678247> You may already know this, but just in case, using Signal for SMS messages only helps to consolidate all of your messages. It doesn't provide any additional security for SMS
20:35:38 <a24678247> it only provides security when you're talking to another user with Signal
20:35:43 <theychuckthisfro> Yes.
20:35:51 <theychuckthisfro> No, I know.
20:36:34 <theychuckthisfro> I'm just using it as an alternative to the default Messaging app for now.
20:48:29 <kalbasit_> how long should ./flash-all.sh take? It's been 30-ish minutes flashing the bootloader
20:53:12 <strcat[m]> kalbasit_: a few seconds to do that
20:53:46 <strcat[m]> kalbasit_: probably a broken USB connection, or you're on Linux and it's not set up to work as non-root per the instructions
20:53:53 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: hmmm
20:54:09 <kalbasit> oh you know what. I forgot to restart after adding myself to the group :facepalm:
20:54:15 <kalbasit> ok I'll do that now.
20:54:41 <strcat[m]> you don't need to add yourself to a group
20:54:50 <strcat[m]> the udev rules have `uaccess` which gives all local sessions access
20:55:02 <strcat[m]> you do need to plug the device in again after getting the udev rules so it applies it to the device
20:55:06 <kalbasit> I do on my Linux distro as I don't add the udev rule by hand
20:55:26 <kalbasit> logout/login also works it's been months since I restarted so wth lol
21:14:11 <quartz11[m]> <a24678247 "I'm getting issues that usually "> i have the same issue here, do you use KDE?
21:14:41 <kalbasit> Well restart did not help. For some reason the USB stack in the kernel is crashing. Switching to my Mac instead...
21:29:11 <kalbasit> Hurray! First install! I use Signal as the Messaging app. Anyway to remove the included messaging app?
21:37:15 <strcat[m]> worth noting Signal as the SMS app doesn't work right in secondary profiles
21:37:25 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: you can disable the built-in app
21:37:57 <strcat[m]> it will remain available in the OS image but you can remove it from a profile / globally
21:38:26 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: any documentation on doing that? I don't know much about profiles
21:39:10 <strcat[m]> if you want to disable the app just go into settings -> apps and disable it
21:39:53 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: yes I'm aware of how to disable apps. But I'm not sure I know what profiles are. It makes me wonder if I can have a work profile (which is google apps unfortunately)
21:41:01 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: user profiles
21:41:17 <strcat[m]> Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple users
21:41:32 <strcat[m]> also read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption which explains a bit about them as do some other sections on that pages
21:41:47 <strcat[m]> user profiles are isolated workspaces with their own instances of apps, and communication / sharing data across them isn't permitted
21:42:11 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: work profiles are a kind of profile owned by a device management app - we fully support them, but user profiles are what we recommend for people to use
21:42:12 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: oh nice
21:42:30 <strcat[m]> each user profile has a separate encryption key protected by their lock method
21:42:48 <strcat[m]> and secondary user profiles can be put back at rest with 'end session' (encryption key purged from memory/hardware)
21:42:58 <strcat[m]> they're underused
21:43:48 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: nice
21:44:41 <kalbasit> I created a work profile. I went to Settings -> Accounts. When I click on Add account the screen flashes. How to add a google account there for work?
21:45:23 <strcat[m]> Settings -> Accounts is for app-based accounts
21:45:26 <strcat[m]> not user accounts
21:45:34 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: System -> Advanced -> Multiple users is for user profiles
21:45:47 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: once you create one, you can switch between them with the icon in the notification tray
21:46:01 <strcat[m]> work profiles are something created by a device manager
21:46:06 <strcat[m]> none of this is related to a Google account
21:46:50 <kalbasit> IIRC to get the device manager installed I have to start by adding the google account and login to it. Is there another way?
21:47:08 <kalbasit> Sorry for all the noob questions, been a samsung user for a long time, and did not give any of this much thought
21:49:52 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: there are non-Google device managers
21:50:14 <strcat[m]> our recommendation for isolated workspaces is using user profiles generally, though
21:51:03 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit go to "Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple Users"
21:51:12 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: sure and after I created the user profile I have to get some stuff for work there, mainly their google email, slack app etc.. I guess I need an email client of some sort?
21:52:16 <TheJollyRoger> I used to use K-9 Mail, but then I took a Fairemail in the workflow.
21:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> Note that apps *need to be the same version* to be installed across profiles.
21:53:24 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise it will reject the installation.
21:54:07 <strcat[m]> or a newer version
21:54:12 <kalbasit> thank you for the recommendation and the heads up
21:54:18 <TheJollyRoger> er, sorry, whoops.
21:54:54 <kalbasit> I'm trying to pull apks and store them and manually install them (starting 1st with signal and bitwarden) and learning about this stuff. Hopefully, I will build my workflow around installing same version across profilse and updating the same way
21:56:24 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: don't need update separately
21:56:39 <strcat[m]> the apk itself is installed once, globally
21:56:50 <strcat[m]> whether or not it is installed in an actual profile is up to that profile
21:57:05 <strcat[m]> that's why you can't install an older version than the one that's already used by other profiles
21:57:31 <strcat[m]> because the OS prevents you installing an update to an app with a lower version or mismatched signing key
21:57:45 <kalbasit> that makes sense
21:58:28 <kalbasit> is `adb sideload something.apk` supposed to work out fo the box? Wondering if it's computer problem or phone problem because it said no devices found
21:58:37 <strcat[m]> similarly just because an app is available in the OS image doesn't mean profiles have to use (thus disabling apps)
21:58:56 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: adb isn't enabled by default and I would recommend getting the apk on the OS and installing it via the OS UI
21:59:20 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: using the browser or another way?
21:59:24 <strcat[m]> the owner profile is also known as the 'system profile'
21:59:28 <strcat[m]> kalbasit: sure, that works
21:59:37 <strcat[m]> go to Signal site in Vanadium, download the apk
21:59:44 <strcat[m]> then from that point on you're getting notified of updates by Signal
22:00:09 <strcat[m]> the OS verifies the signing key of apps when installing and pins the key once it's installed
22:00:24 <strcat[m]> it's possible to rotate the signing key by including proof that the rotation is authorized by the previous signing key
22:00:37 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to add Signal and Vanadium to the whitelist of special permissions for them to sideload apps. This is at this moment a somewhat clumsy workaround, but it's necessary to install apps you download, until GrapheneOS gets a first-party app store.
22:00:37 <strcat[m]> and the OS prevents installing a version with a lower versionCode
22:01:01 <strcat[m]> so, basically all you need to know is you can't install an older version of an app on one profile
22:01:09 <strcat[m]> and any profile can update the overall installation of the app
22:01:40 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: just allowed Vanadium to install unknown apps, trying now
22:01:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Signal will also be needed to be added to the whitelist, so it can update itself.
22:02:02 <kalbasit> strcat[m]: thansk for all the details, this will definitely help my oh shit stuff broke moments lol
22:02:24 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: Ah I see. Sure I'll do that. Is that for every app or only specific apps?
22:02:41 <TheJollyRoger> Only those two. The Signal APK version is different than the Play (and by extension, Aurora) store version, in that it has functionality to self-update.
22:03:00 <TheJollyRoger> This was done to give non-GPlay phone users something of a source to remain current.
22:03:12 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: I see
22:03:14 <TheJollyRoger> (So people stopped sourcing random-ass APKs from third party sources, and then never updating them)
22:03:23 <strcat[m]> note that when you permit an app to install apps, you still always have to confirm each installation
22:03:27 <kalbasit> That makes sense
22:03:30 <strcat[m]> including updates
22:03:47 <strcat[m]> only the OS itself can auto-update apps without confirmation and we don't currently have our own first party repo + app using it
22:04:19 <TheJollyRoger> However, self-updating your app out of band is a big no-no on Google Play - if Google catches you doing that they will suspend your account. So that's why the versions of Signal released on Google Play and the APK are not the same.
22:04:37 <TheJollyRoger> (as in, they will suspend the publisher's app, not yours)
22:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> (this is why Signal has to do this)
22:04:56 <kalbasit> it makes sense. they want control over the whole thing
22:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> There's more nuance to it than that;
22:05:42 <TheJollyRoger> it's because it normalizes an extremely dangerous and harmful behaviour that shouldn't be done by people who aren't responsible enough to know the difference.
22:05:47 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: since no first-party store right now. Do you recommend grabbing apks manually from various sources or is there a store available to install and have it take care of that. One that you trust obviously
22:06:48 <TheJollyRoger> So self-updating your app encourages users to place random apps they download on the whitelist and normalizes an *extremely* harmful behaviour by allowing those apps to install other applications, even if they can't override the mandatory access contorls.
22:07:54 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit: you can try with the Aurora store (If you use the website release of Signal, please add Signal to the update blacklist in Aurora), it's a mirror of the Google Play Store.
22:08:58 <nullnode[m]> Molly.im works great and imports Signal backups no matter what Version
22:08:59 <nullnode[m]> uses the same Signal servers in the backend as well
22:09:45 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: Thanks, I'll try it out!
22:09:56 <kalbasit> nullnode[m]: Yes on my list to try out as well
22:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit: Yeah, there's more nuance to Google doing things they way they do than "they want to control everything." The Play store, coupled with the design of the Android certificate pinning model, is an example of good design.
22:11:19 <TheJollyRoger> Since the decentralized signing model ensures that the author of one app cannot push updates for apps they themselves don't have the keys for.
22:13:36 <TheJollyRoger> This trust-on-first-contact arrangement ensures that Google actually does not become a trusted third party in the way apps are distributed. If Google themselves wanted to compromise an app that the author of the app personally signs, they would either need to steal the keys, or need to compromise it retroactively, since not even Play services can override the mandatory access controls set by
22:13:38 <TheJollyRoger> the kernel on the Google OS.
22:13:58 <TheJollyRoger> This way, application signing is not centralized on Play.
22:14:22 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: I'm sure FB would love to get their hands on more permissions than they're allowed. I don't know much about how it works, I'm fully aware of how private/public certs and TLS work I'm just saying specifically the play store as I'm not an Android developer myself so not necessarly exposed to it
22:15:02 <TheJollyRoger> I'm sure they would! I still haven't forgotten the time they "accidentally" requested root access :D.
22:15:50 <kalbasit> lol
22:16:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you need/want to, you can install the apps you don't like/don't trust into a separate user account. GrapheneOS adds an "end session/log out" key to the lockscreen, so once you're done using those apps, you can end the session, and the operating system will halt that profile and eject the encryption keys from memory.
22:18:03 <kalbasit> TheJollyRoger: I don't install FB or its apps but that's good to know
22:18:20 <kalbasit> Are the profiles a native android feature or graphene feature?
22:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
22:18:38 <TheJollyRoger> The profiles are a native Android feature, but the "end session" command is unique to GrapheneOS.
22:18:50 <TheJollyRoger> As are the "Network/Sensors" permission toggle.
22:19:06 <kalbasit> nice
22:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> Network and Sensors permissions are granted by default, since apps have no way to ask for them because regular Android's not supposed to have those.
22:19:40 <kalbasit> Regarding Aurora store. I got to the login screen. Choosing anonymous fails to login. Have you taken the risk of using your google account instead?
22:24:32 <TheJollyRoger> I don't have one.
22:26:01 <TheJollyRoger> I think the tokenizer might be down, you may have to enable Aurora's tokenizer instead.
22:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> Gotta run though, good luck!
22:26:19 <kalbasit> Thank you!
22:53:44 <noobexterminator> OHH YEAHHH
22:53:46 <noobexterminator> I know the fix
22:53:54 <noobexterminator> Just press the Back button bruh
22:54:33 <noobexterminator> I had the same issue on my J2
22:55:16 <noobexterminator> Just spam the Back button and youll go to the Apps Section and all that
22:56:33 <noobexterminator> And if that dosent work Enable the Tockenizer option
22:57:09 <noobexterminator> And if thay also fails try downgrading the version but i wouldnt recomend it
22:59:21 <noobexterminator> kalbasit
23:11:45 <iduno8912> Does Graphene OS allow me to install a working MicoG via F-Droid?
23:13:38 <zknshfr[m]> <iduno8912 "Does Graphene OS allow me to ins"> Yes
23:14:24 <zknshfr[m]> But it's not prefered, at least install it in other profile and remove permissions
23:14:43 <zknshfr[m]> Works for the pixel camera port
23:16:56 <zknshfr[m]> Question: Is there an option to turn off the automatic updates? (I can't seem to find it and found nothing on FAQ)
23:20:02 <iduno8912> zknshfr[m]: After installing GmsCore, under microG self-check it says my "ROM has no native support for signature spoofing"
23:24:41 <iduno8912> is there a guide somewhere for using Graphene + micoG + Play Store Apps
23:25:26 <iduno8912> or what is the best way to get apps relying on Play Services to run on Graphene?
23:25:56 <sphinxcat[m]> <zknshfr[m] "Question: Is there an option to "> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-disabling
23:29:46 <hashenstein[m]> Yay! Thanks @sphinxcat!
23:37:29 <kalbasit> noobexterminator: Thank you! I'll try that out
23:58:28 <hashenstein[m]> Is there an app for editing photos that does basic image correction like exposure, contrast, shadows, etc, and runs well on GrapheneOS?
