00:00:05 <HoGiHung> I see, I need the sargo one.  /slap head!
00:00:25 <Pratyush[m]> HoGiHung You're welcome.
00:10:47 <frontman[m]1> <b1101 "hope pixel 5 support comes withi"> I will have to go with 4xl because the 4a doesn't have wireless charging.
00:12:46 <Pratyush[m]> I have both 4 (non xl), i don't know about you but i use it as tool never mind charging for 3 hour or so btw 4a battery is solid and 4xl face id is oswm.
00:12:46 <Pratyush[m]> In any case with Graphene you can not go wrong with any.
00:16:16 <frontman[m]1> I use it as a tool, and I try to reduce how often I have to stick a thing into a thing. Much easier to smack it into a cradle mounted on my dash.
00:18:35 <b1101> I'm currently on the p3. Will definitely use it until the end of the year, if not longer. also p5 price needs to drop
00:37:25 <HoGiHung> thanks again Pratush, I'm up and running now.  :)
00:41:17 <CaptainBlackton> How safe is it to use a GrapheneOS device with a SIM card? Can that security flaw that allows remotely accessing the device through the SIM be activated even if the data is kept off? And do I need a SIM card in order for the GPS location service to work?
00:45:44 <snooopy> CaptainBlackton: GPS works without simcards
00:46:48 <Pratyush[m]> <CaptainBlackton "How safe is it to use a Graphene"> Not known one yet, and hopefully not possible unless some major security flaw discovered in os or kernal.
00:54:36 <anonymous821[m]> <bigpawg "Same on 3aXL. "> were you able to find out what the issue was?
00:55:23 <xcfe_100> i have successfully installed graphene. what should I know about it now that I have it installed?
00:55:39 <xcfe_100> are there any best practices, how often should I check for updates, etc?
00:58:50 <curios12345[m]> Which "developer options" does grapheneOS have active by default?
00:59:32 <curios12345[m]> Or are they all disabled?
00:59:39 <Pratyush[m]> <xcfe_100 "are there any best practices, ho"> On gos website you will find some tips, update are set to auto update you will get notification if internet is available in your device.
01:01:15 <Pratyush[m]> Check out #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
01:01:15 <Pratyush[m]> For discussion on topic where people will go seriously deep into topic related to privacy and security
01:48:05 <TheJollyRoger> CaptainBlackton: GrapheneOS isolates the devices from the host via system memory management. Devices like the phone's modem and radios (cellular baseband, GPU, SSD, et al) can only acess the memory that the driver in the kernel allows it to.
01:49:00 <TheJollyRoger> Since roughly 2012, phones have separated devices such as the baseband, the radios, and such from host memory by SMMU.
01:54:49 <TheJollyRoger> mynacol[m]: Well, the drivers are all open source, but with Linux not having any type of stable driver interface, I don't think it would be very easy to do that. It would be a ton of work, that's for sure.
02:04:41 <Vanessa> Hi
02:04:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
02:04:52 <Vanessa> Hello, I have a Pixel 2XL device with GrapheneOS "RQ1A.210105.003.2021.01.06.14 (taimen-factory-2021.01.06.14.zip)" on it, but it still shows Android Security Update as Nov 1, 2020. Any idea why?
02:05:43 <TheJollyRoger> Whew, glad you asked! The Pixel 2 is now out of service. It's no longer being updated, what the maintainers did was they shipped a last update as a migration strategy to buy people that were still stranded on Pixel 2s a bit more time to migrate off them.
02:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> The patch level is permanently frozen at November of 2020, since upstream has dropped support for the device, and so has qualcomm.
02:07:13 <Vanessa> Thanks Jolly for your reply, but does that mean that it won't receive any further GrapheneOS updates or security patches?
02:07:53 <TheJollyRoger> You're correct. The update that the project maintainers shipped back last week is a "fond farewell" update.
02:08:11 <Vanessa> I imagine you're talking about firmware updates since you mentioned Qualcomm, but are we still going to get software patches/updates from AOSP upstream?
02:09:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, upstream has abandoned the handset, there will be no further security patches from them.
02:09:30 <Vanessa> Ah, ok... I was so hopeful that this magnificent device can last for another year with updates from Graphene. It's a bit sad, but understandable of course. It requires a lot of efforts.
02:10:07 <Vanessa> I really appreciate your reply. Thank you.
02:10:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's depressing watching perfectly good phones become poptarts, but you're right, once Upstream abandons it, the effort to maintain the device skyrockets immensely.
02:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! Anything else I might be able to help you with?
02:11:58 <Vanessa> May be any idea, what other OS can keep this going?!:)  I can't seem to find any practical OS other than GrapheneOS. Other efforts like Ubuntu touch (and similar efforts) look like half baked and not suitable for a real life usage!
02:12:07 * TheJollyRoger thinks.
02:13:27 <TheJollyRoger> I... I really don't know actually. Once the device is no longer being maintained, I don't think it's safe to use. What I like to do with my old phones that have reached their end of life is to permanently put them into Airplane mode, and use them as cheap MP3 players or "decoy" phones for going to wherever needs music played, or for riding my skateboard.
02:14:09 <Vanessa> You know, that's actually a very nice idea. I might do the same! Thanks for the suggestion.
02:14:19 <TheJollyRoger> since that way if I wipe out and smash ass-first onto my phone down concrete steps, then at the very least I'm not smashing a phone it's going to cost me seven hundred dollars to replace!
02:14:43 <TheJollyRoger> Or if someone at the gym decides to steal the phones left out to use the music system!
02:14:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hey anytime!
02:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> Vanessa, if you're looking for a replacement device, the 4a is probably the best value for the money at this moment in time.
02:18:35 <rny> or 4a 5g
02:18:37 <Vanessa> I have Pixel 5 already as an upgrade of my main phone (Pixel 2XL). But I really wanted to keep this phone going for another year or 2. Was thinking about KaiOS but it's not that OS you would want to actually use.
02:18:44 <rny> the 4a 5g uses the same chipset as the 5
02:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. The 5 is currently in closed beta testing right now, I don't know an ETA though.
02:19:10 <Vanessa> I wonder why Google provide 7 to 8 years of support for their new Chromebooks and only 3 for the Pixels!!!
02:19:23 <TheJollyRoger> I think it has to do with Qualcomm, all in.
02:19:38 <Vanessa> But Chromebooks also have Qualcomm, some of the at least.
02:20:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The thing is though, how long they support the chip depends on how much Google negotiates with them for support. I suppose that laptops tend to be used for longer, but phones generally most people replace once they've paid off their tabs.
02:20:35 <TheJollyRoger> As awful as this is :(
02:20:48 <XenoProteins18> Hi
02:20:49 <XenoProteins18> https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/01/cell-phone-location-privacy.html
02:21:08 <XenoProteins18> "We all know that our cell phones constantly give our location away to
02:21:09 <XenoProteins18> our mobile network operators; that’s how they work. A group of
02:21:09 <XenoProteins18> researchers has figured out a way to fix that. “Pretty Good Phone
02:21:10 <XenoProteins18> Privacy” (PGPP) protects both user identity and user location using the
02:21:10 <XenoProteins18> existing cellular networks. It protects users from fake cell phone
02:21:11 <XenoProteins18> towers (IMSI-catchers) and surveillance by cell providers."
02:21:12 <XenoProteins18> Looks HAWT =)
02:23:18 <TheJollyRoger> I'll give that a look in a bit!
02:23:57 <XenoProteins18> It looks like the technology is 100% working, but getting all major cell carrier to actually impliment it, likely wont happen, do to the government wanting to track everybody
02:24:22 <XenoProteins18> Similar to how GPS are now mandatory on all mobile phones
02:24:24 <XenoProteins18> https://news.yahoo.com/fcc-mandate-gps-phones-2018-161433457.html
02:24:43 <XenoProteins18> Is there a way to disable the GPS at a firmware/lower level way on Graphene?
02:25:04 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know offhand.
02:25:16 <XenoProteins18> It basically makes the SIM just provide a hashed token, which is changed every so often
02:25:27 <XenoProteins18> Instead of Phone Serieal number and other specific information
02:25:50 <XenoProteins18> Is there some way to track phones in airplane mode?
02:25:57 <XenoProteins18> Such as by beaming a radio at the phone
02:26:05 <TheJollyRoger> Though that said, note that because firmware is initialized by the host, in theory it would be possible to get the host to not initialize the firmware if you know which one to not load.
02:26:05 <Scott78> Hi, I am trying to replace grapheneOS with stock OS, but getting hung up on one fastboot command via the directions.  On the flashing factory image step, moving into the directory.  Not sure what to include in the command "cd xxx" - for grapheneOS the cmd is "cd sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03" - I am trying to load 11.0.0 (RQ1A.210105.002, Jan
02:26:05 <XenoProteins18> Like how a mirror reflects light
02:26:06 <Scott78> 2021) -  appreciate help.
02:26:20 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: sure, it's called a flashlight and your eyes.
02:26:33 <XenoProteins18> cd sunfish just moves the directory to the Graphene Folder
02:26:47 <XenoProteins18> I mean, can the NSA just beam some signal at a phone and the phone absorbs the signal
02:26:52 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Scott78, I can do a walkdown for you if you prefer.
02:26:54 <XenoProteins18> And therefore radiates some signal
02:27:14 <XenoProteins18> Like a radiated cantelope fruit
02:27:23 <XenoProteins18> You can radiate a fruit then detect its radiation from far away
02:27:32 <XenoProteins18> Can the GPS be backdoored?
02:27:38 <XenoProteins18> Have covert remote access?
02:27:40 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: I think you're going far, far, far above the threat model GrapheneOS assumes, man.
02:27:51 <XenoProteins18> I mean this is all how the NSa works
02:28:00 <XenoProteins18> Fly drove above populance, Gorgon Stare style
02:28:09 <XenoProteins18> Beam onto off phones
02:28:20 <Scott78> that would be helpful TheJollyRoger - I've got the stock downloaded in fastboot, just stuck on the next steps, trying to run the flash-all.bat cmd is not working
02:28:21 <XenoProteins18> Possibly some phone GPS backdoor to remotely awaken
02:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: Your best defense would be is to radio Han in the Millennium Falcon to come rescue you.
02:28:55 <XenoProteins18> For Example
02:28:56 <XenoProteins18> The GPS requirement is so emergency 911 responders can track a caller’s location to more accurately send assistance.
02:29:09 <XenoProteins18> During 911 calls, the 911-call center operater can see your exact location
02:29:16 <XenoProteins18> Some sort of E911 system geolocation GPS-based
02:29:30 <XenoProteins18> Therefore Im thinking that E911/GPS system probably has a remote silent backdoor access.
02:29:45 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: Sure, hang on a second - I can try to do a walkdown for you in a bit. What's your host?
02:29:47 <XenoProteins18> How do 911 calls work on Graphne? Does the 911 operater still see current location?
02:29:56 <TheJollyRoger> I'm assuming it's Windows, are you in PowerShell?
02:30:08 <Scott78> yes, windows in powershell
02:30:16 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: 911 calls work on Graphene Via the publicly switched telephone network, and yes, the 911 Operator can see your location if you call 911.
02:30:33 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: great, can you post me the output of "fastboot --version" please?
02:31:03 <XenoProteins18> "he 911 Operator can see your location if you call 911." do you know the exact firmware/hardware/software involved in the 911-GPS location finding
02:31:03 <Scott78> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
02:31:08 <XenoProteins18> Id like to scan for backdoors, remote access
02:31:29 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: It's not that: It's that you're near a cellphone tower.
02:31:53 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: if you want to stop cell tracking, please turn on airplane mode, turn off your WiFi, Bluetooth, and mute your sound. Done.
02:32:14 <TheJollyRoger> Put your phone on Do Not Disturb because if the phone rings and you're walking around people can hear you.
02:32:24 <TheJollyRoger> And put it in your pocket.
02:32:40 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: Okay, great. You're using 4a?
02:32:49 <Scott78> yes
02:33:00 <XenoProteins18> I mean during a 911 call
02:33:12 <XenoProteins18> How exactly does the phone and 911 operator see my GPS location
02:33:26 <XenoProteins18> Is the GPS-911 Location Firmware/hardware based? Whats the firmware called?
02:33:29 <XenoProteins18> E911 Firmware?
02:34:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, Scott78, can you run the following for me:
02:34:23 <TheJollyRoger> Remove-Item Alias:Curl
02:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> Then hit return. It should return you to the Powershell Prompt.
02:35:07 <TheJollyRoger> (Make sure you see the little "PS" next to "C:\" - if you don't see that, let me know.
02:35:21 <Scott78> got the following message: Remove-Item : Cannot find path 'Alias:\Curl' because it does not exist.
02:35:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great, that's OK.
02:35:40 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like it's not aliased.
02:35:48 <TheJollyRoger> Try now:
02:35:50 <TheJollyRoger> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
02:36:13 <xcfe_100> im having some trouble with my wifi on graphene, I can connect to my mobile hotspot but cant connect to my local wifi networks
02:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> If this produces a redtext "not the name of a command" error, let me know, because if it does then something's wrong with your pathing or powershell session.
02:36:33 <xcfe_100> any chance this is graphene related or is it probably some issue with my wifi?
02:36:34 <XenoProteins18> Perhaps local networks dont support on-by-default MAC Address Randomization
02:36:45 <XenoProteins18> Does your local WIFI have MAC Address Whitelisting enabled?
02:36:55 <xcfe_100> i have no idea
02:37:01 <XenoProteins18> By Default, Graphene OS randomizes your Graphene Pixel MAC Address every connection
02:37:07 <XenoProteins18> If your just a casual home user, it should be connecting
02:37:15 <xcfe_100> its a pretty old router
02:37:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hi xcfe_100, might be your local wifi.
02:37:19 <XenoProteins18> double check your wifi passphrase is correct, try restarting your wifi router and the phone =)
02:37:28 <xcfe_100> i actually tried all 3
02:37:40 <Scott78> it downloaded the file
02:37:41 <xcfe_100> is there a way to temporarily disable to randomization and see if that works?
02:37:52 <XenoProteins18> yes go to wifi settings
02:37:56 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: ok, great, next step:
02:37:57 <XenoProteins18> I doubt wifi randomization is causing issues
02:38:05 <XenoProteins18> Look for mac randomization settings
02:38:10 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to unzip the archive:
02:38:14 <TheJollyRoger> tar xvf sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
02:38:16 <XenoProteins18> or search for "mac" "Randomiation"
02:38:23 <XenoProteins18> "Randomization"
02:38:29 <xcfe_100> ill try it with it disabled and see the results
02:38:41 <Scott78> done
02:38:51 <XenoProteins18> aLRIGHT
02:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: you now should be able to move into the directory: punch in:
02:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> cd sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03
02:39:56 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know if that works or doesn't.
02:40:04 <Scott78> worked
02:40:31 <Scott78> so now go ahead with ./flash-all.bat?
02:40:33 <xcfe_100> also if this makes a difference it seems i can connect to the router and have the passphrase right, but cant connect to the internet
02:40:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hold it, not yet.
02:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> Get your phone out, and switch it on to the bootloader for me?
02:41:11 <TheJollyRoger> you've enabled OEM unlocking, and unlocked bootloader?
02:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> Before you hit flash-all there's a few things I need you to do first on your end, just to make sure it goes alright.
02:42:38 <xcfe_100> okay changing the randomization didnt do anything, still not working
02:42:43 <Scott78> yes, phone bootloader is unlocked
02:43:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, plug it in and set it somewhere where it won't fall. If your motherboard has a rear port, use that, we've found that some motherboard vendors don't adequately implement proper tracing into the front ports, so use the rear ones if you're on a desktop.
02:43:58 <Scott78> good to go
02:44:15 <XenoProteins18> Try connecting to WIFI, then using a VPN
02:44:19 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: Once we start the process, you're going to need to make sure to let it run to completion - it will get you to fastbootd, while it writes the slot. A lot of people think it's done at that point, but it isn't,  if you interrupt it it will leave it incomplete.
02:44:28 <XenoProteins18> Try restarting the router
02:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> So you must not disturb the phone until you see "Finished. Press any key to exit", ready?
02:44:45 <xcfe_100> what would connecting to the VPN do?
02:44:58 <Scott78> ready
02:45:13 <TheJollyRoger> As tempting as it is, we should not disturb the phone until it prints that warning. Make sure both ends of the cables are plugged in tight and then hit "./flash-all.bat" and press return.
02:45:37 <TheJollyRoger> *er, until it prints that confirmation.
02:45:51 <XenoProteins18> I mean Im just telling you what has worked for me
02:46:05 <XenoProteins18> Sometimes Ive had VPN connections/daemons on when I turned off my phone
02:46:15 <XenoProteins18> Then I had to disconnect and reconnect to the VPN to restore normal internet access
02:46:19 <XenoProteins18> Normally due to a VPN-Only firewall
02:46:21 <XenoProteins18> Just try it
02:46:26 <XenoProteins18> Connect to WIFI, then VPN
02:49:36 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: once it prints that confirmation, you can either boot the phone to check that GrapheneOS installed, and lock the bootloader, or you can lock the bootloader immediately.
02:50:52 <TheJollyRoger> But don't unplug her just yet.
02:51:09 <rny> xcfe_100: are you living in an apartment complex?
02:52:21 <Scott78> so i got the confirmation; phone went to load (i guess) and now getting message Can't find valid operating system.  The device will not start, pretty sure that's not good.
02:52:23 <xcfe_100> rny, yes, so unfortunately cant manually restart the router
02:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: Hey wait up a sec.
02:53:03 <TheJollyRoger> Shoot.
02:53:16 <rny> xcfe_100: could be interferrence or a stupid troll neighbour mounting random deauth attacks
02:53:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment.
02:54:13 <xcfe_100> i dont think they have the technical skill to be doing deauths
02:54:30 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: unlock the bootloader, let me see if I can figure out what went wrong...
02:55:06 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78 you're able to confirm there's no other fastboot versions, no "minimal adb", or third-party fastboots on your computer?
02:55:52 <xcfe_100> also have an unrelated question, what exactly is the auditor app?
02:55:56 <Scott78> there is not; i can't get to the bootloader screen now
02:56:14 <Scott78> nevermind, just got back to it
02:57:17 <TheJollyRoger> This is weird. The version of fastboot is correct, it shouldn't have flashed the wrong slot...
02:57:33 <TheJollyRoger> rny, anupritaisno1[m], er, do you guys have any input on this?
02:58:12 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: the device is not ruined (we can always turn back via Google's web flasher if worst comes to worst), just I'm not sure why this happened.
03:00:05 <rny> Scott78: did you follow the instructions on the website verbatim?
03:00:23 <rny> if you have downloaded files from previous months, please re-download the latest
03:00:35 <rny> bootloaders get updated sometimes.
03:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> rny: I did a walk-through with him.
03:01:02 <Scott78> thank you! and I did along with TheJollyRogers help; should I try flashing again?
03:01:11 <TheJollyRoger> So I'm kinda shocked, this is the first time this has ever happened to me.
03:01:17 <rny> reflash stock, then re-attempt the Graphene OS steps
03:01:38 <rny> if issues continue to arise, please come back
03:02:02 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: there are a few ways we can get your device back to stock condition: the easiest way is via Google's Android Flash tool.
03:02:20 <rny> could be in an inconsistent state now
03:02:26 <rny> so reflashing stock will fix it
03:03:47 <TheJollyRoger> Scott78: the android flash tool should be here, at https://flash.android.com/ . This is the easiest and fastest way to revert back to the way it used to be.
03:04:08 <Scott78> thank you
03:05:29 <Scott78> I really appreciate the help; I'll use the tool and try again, will come back if I have issues
03:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> Of course! And you're always welcome to stick around too, heh heh.
03:06:00 <Scott78> XD
03:06:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
03:09:31 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know how it goes.
03:09:36 <TheJollyRoger> xcfe_100: oh yeah, Auditor...
03:09:50 <TheJollyRoger> xcfe_100: The Auditor app is an integrity self-monitoring tool;
03:10:33 <xcfe_100> what exactly does it do, it seems you need multiple phones?
03:10:39 <TheJollyRoger> A bit of background on it: starting with handsets that first shipped with Android 8.0 and every handset that followed in their footsteps, Android devices actually contain the capability to self-attest to their verified boot keying with a secret key that's buried within the phone's secure enclave
03:10:47 <TheJollyRoger> xcfe_100: lemme get to that in a second :)
03:11:17 <TheJollyRoger> This allows the phone to prove, to another device, with a high amount of certainty, what operating system it is running, and what keys its bootloader is currently verifying to.
03:11:58 <TheJollyRoger> My guess is that this was originally done for secure payment processing, but what Auditor did was repurpose the capability to allow you to find out if you're running the real GrapheneOS or not, and if it's been tampered with since you installed it.
03:12:38 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to do local verification (ie: verify in your hands), then yes, you will need another Android device that can run the app - it doesn't have to be one capable of remote attestation itself though to read the audit data.
03:13:52 <TheJollyRoger> The other thing you can do is remote verification. GrapheneOS maintains its own Attestation server that already has the authentic verified boot keys pre-loaded into it, at https://attestation.app/tutorial
03:14:37 <TheJollyRoger> So what you can do is set your phone up to pair with the in-house attestation server, and for it to send "Hello phone, prove to me that you're running GrapheneOS" at a set number of hours.
03:15:20 <TheJollyRoger> If the phone fails to check in after a set number of hours, the Attestation Server can dispatch a warning to an E-mail address you've arranged ahead of time, to let you know the device isn't checking in, or has checked in wrong.
03:15:43 <strcat> xcfe_100: the challenging (Auditor) side gives a random value (challenge string), the Auditee has to respond with an attestation response proving various things
03:16:20 <strcat> the overall attestation response is signed with the hardware backed key (i.e. stored in the HSM, cannot be exported) they made for the initial pairing
03:16:30 <strcat> (so that part only gets useful after the initial pairing)
03:16:49 <strcat> and it includes inside it the public key certificate chain for that hardware backed key
03:17:21 <strcat> public key certificate for the key it generated -> attestation key provisioned on the HSM at the factory -> intermediate -> attestation root
03:17:37 <strcat> (that's a signed certificate chain)
03:18:02 <xcfe_100> wow, thats a pretty cool feature, would never even think something like this would exist
03:18:05 <strcat> and inside the public key certificate for the key it generated, the HSM adds various attestation data fields including the OS verified boot key, OS patch level, etc.
03:18:34 <strcat> and it also includes an important set of data from the OS: the application id and signing key fingerprint(s) for the app which made the key
03:18:45 <strcat> so this allows chaining trust to the app
03:19:05 <TheJollyRoger> xcfe_100: yeah, when I saw it demonstrated the first time, it blew my mind. It's really cool!
03:19:19 <strcat> xcfe_100: so, lets say an attacker makes an evil Auditor app to install on GrapheneOS - they cannot even fake *application-level* checks because the hardware is chaining verification to the app through the OS
03:19:34 <strcat> they would have to compromise the OS and gain deep access just to fake application-level checks
03:19:47 <strcat> and having root / kernel access in the OS would NOT allow faking the hardware-based checks
03:20:03 <strcat> unless they compromise the boot chain firmware, they can't fake the OS verified boot key, OS patch level, etc.
03:20:22 <strcat> in early boot the OS patch level is sent over to the HSM
03:20:29 <TheJollyRoger> hot damn, I didn't know that part!
03:20:56 <strcat> on Pixels, the HSM is actually where the verified boot key (for an alternative OS) is stored
03:21:01 <strcat> it isn't necessarily where it is
03:21:51 <strcat> so during the initial pairing the Auditor side (app or server) stores the public key certificate chain for the hardware-backed key and pins it
03:22:39 <strcat> and from then on, it enforces that this persistent hardware-backed key the app generated is used to sign the attestations, and that all future attestation messages have the same certificate chain for the new 'fresh' keys it makes to get new hardware key attestations
03:23:43 <strcat> also that challenge string is contained in the public key certificate with the other attestation info (and that certificate is signed by that cert chain via the key provisioned on the device)
03:23:56 <strcat> the purpose of the challenge string is to prevent reusing an attestation from before
03:24:19 <strcat> so when you do this locally, the initial QR code you scan is the challenge, then the one the Auditee makes is the attestation response
03:24:32 <strcat> the protocol we use is a wrapper around the key attestation system basically
03:24:37 <strcat> documented in the source
03:25:13 <strcat> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/attestation/auditor/AttestationProtocol.java#L119-L151
03:25:20 <strcat> that's what the QR codes actually contain
03:26:29 <strcat> oh and need to update those docs because we *do* provide backwards compatibility for protocol changes (and then drop support for the old protocol eventually)
03:27:21 <strcat[m]> it basically negotiates a version (Auditor sends max supported version, Auditee uses the highest version it supports not beyond that)
03:27:35 <TheJollyRoger> Let me see...
03:27:37 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/attestation/auditor/AttestationProtocol.java#L1012-L1013
03:28:05 <strcat[m]> so in protocol version 2, we support different attestation roots, so it sends an extra certificate
03:28:20 <strcat[m]> it started at version 0 for the revived attestation app again, so there have been 3 protocol versions since then
03:29:10 <strcat[m]> technically had more protocol versions but we had to redo everything when we got fucked over by a narcissistic sociopath so yeah... I took the opportunity to start the version code of the app at 1 and the protocol version at 0
03:29:14 <xcfe_100> still having trouble with my wifi, tried troubleshooting a few things, could it be the DNS settings on graphene or something?
03:29:35 <xcfe_100> this is so weird, my mobile hotspot works, but the routers will not connect
03:30:14 <strcat[m]> what kind of trouble?
03:30:20 <strcat[m]> exactly
03:31:35 <xcfe_100> i can connect to my routers, but then cant connect to the internet
03:31:45 <xcfe_100> but it works when I connect to a mobile hotspot
03:32:20 <somenerd[m]> possibly a router problem?
03:33:00 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I'll go and see if I can get this updated for you.
03:35:04 <xcfe_100> strcat, maybe but when I was installing graphene on google android, I was able to connect using my router to download updates
03:35:11 <xcfe_100> thats what strange about it
03:41:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hey strcat[m], once a phone has been paired successfully, the auditee cannot be "rolled back" to an earlier version, right?
03:43:33 <TheJollyRoger> If so I can update the doc here.
03:46:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'll just update this one sentence for now and put it in different PRs.
03:48:52 <joofar> Hello, Im having trouble flashing grapheneos
03:49:08 <joofar> when I do ./flash-all.sh
03:49:17 <joofar> all it says is < waiting for any device >
03:49:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hello joofar, it sounds like you're on Linux, do you have your udev rules properly set (and if you set them, did you reboot your computer or reload the udev rules first?)
03:50:06 <joofar> yes i rebooted
03:50:36 <TheJollyRoger> Quick sanity check: is your phone plugged in and on fastboot, not booted to the operating system?
03:51:16 <TheJollyRoger> What do you get when you do "fastboot devices" and "fastboot --version" ?
03:51:50 <joofar> no output for fastboot devices
03:51:51 <joofar> fastboot --version
03:51:51 <joofar> fastboot version 30.0.5
03:51:52 <joofar> Installed as /usr/bin/fastboot
03:52:09 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I presume you're running Arch or Manjaro?
03:52:16 <joofar> arch
03:53:57 <rny> xcfe_100: try using the google wifi-connectivity check
03:54:04 <rny> and see if it "successfully" connects
03:54:15 <rny> do you see limited connectivity when you connect to your wifi?
03:54:55 <TheJollyRoger> joofar:, you've got android-udev installed, right?
03:55:11 <joofar> yes
03:55:22 * TheJollyRoger thinks.
03:55:38 <TheJollyRoger> Running out of ideas, but try switching cables? Sometimes that does it.
03:56:17 <TheJollyRoger> Or ports. Since sometimes not all cables conform to the USB standard, some vendors (especially on front USB ports) don't implement full tracing on all of them.
03:56:27 <TheJollyRoger> that's all I've got so far, unfortunately.
03:57:25 <joofar> im using the one from the pixel box
03:57:33 <joofar> im trying another now
03:57:44 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
03:57:51 <joofar> didn't work
03:58:10 <TheJollyRoger> Crap. Hmm. I'm outta ideas.
04:01:01 <joofar> what should the usb preferences be. I have it on File transfer/Android Auto
04:01:16 <TheJollyRoger> Hey wait up, you should be in fastboot.
04:01:24 <TheJollyRoger> Not in the operating system.
04:01:36 <TheJollyRoger> punch in "adb reboot bootloader" in bash and let it reboot.
04:02:01 <joofar> that says  error: no devices/emulators found
04:02:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do the combo key then. Switch your phone off.
04:02:35 <TheJollyRoger> Now I want you to press and hold down VOLUMEDOWN, then press and hold down POWER and hold that down until you see the phone come to life in fastboot.
04:02:44 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah. uh...
04:02:47 <TheJollyRoger> Before we go any further,
04:02:58 <TheJollyRoger> Is there anything on that phone you cannot afford to lose?
04:03:04 <joofar> Its doing something
04:03:08 <TheJollyRoger> Pictures, contact lists, 2FA seeds...?
04:03:10 <joofar> seems to be working
04:03:24 <joofar> I backed up everything before
04:03:36 <TheJollyRoger> Because this is going to cause the phone to turn over the tokens in its secure enclave. We can't change them back afterward so this is the last chance to turn around and save whatever you have left on that phone.
04:03:38 <TheJollyRoger> OK great!
04:03:57 <TheJollyRoger> Do you see something that says something like "Fastboot, phone status: locked" ?
04:04:03 <TheJollyRoger> Black screen with white and red text on it?
04:05:38 <joofar> In fastboot mode, Device state: unlocked, Enter reason: no valid slot to boot
04:05:56 <TheJollyRoger> I...
04:06:00 <TheJollyRoger> Wait what did you just do?
04:06:29 <joofar> I went into the bootload mode with the power button and volume, then did ./flash-all.sh
04:06:39 <joofar> I already had it unlocked
04:07:32 <TheJollyRoger> the flashing script returned you to the prompt, you didn't switch out of fastbootd, did you...?
04:08:52 <joofar> between unlocking it, and now yeah
04:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> If you let the script run to completion, you can start it to check that it installed correctly and boots.
04:09:38 <TheJollyRoger> BEFORE you lock it.
04:13:24 <joofar> It works thank you for your help
04:13:32 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
04:13:36 <TheJollyRoger> joofar: before you go any further,
04:13:41 <TheJollyRoger> return to fastboot, and lock the bootloader.
04:13:51 <joofar> will do!
04:13:51 <TheJollyRoger> Use the combo keys to get there.
04:14:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Once you have, can you confirm it's displaying a yellow "Your device is loading a different operating system" in yellow text?
04:14:16 <TheJollyRoger> (When you switch her on?)
04:15:09 <joofar> yes
04:15:10 <TheJollyRoger> After that, you'll want to go back into your phone's developer options and switch off OEM unlocking, and optionally pair with Auditor at https://attestation.app before you start using the phone.
04:15:12 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
04:15:29 <TheJollyRoger> Install's finished then, once you see that yellow screen. Welcome aboard the ship.
04:16:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you find the software useful or just want to support GrapheneOS, please donate to us at https://grapheneos.org/donate , 100% of donations go directly to support the project.
04:23:49 <joofar> will checkout auditor
04:27:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's one heck of an app. Just minutes before you got in it was discussed in detail, you can go and check out the logs on logbot.
04:31:55 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off for a little bit. Welcome aboard the ship.
04:32:26 <ffff> Is there a 4a 5G testing specific channel? I saw on the logs that #grapheneos-testing mentioned but it doesn't exist? Is there a test build available on github?
04:36:56 <TheJollyRoger> Urf.
04:36:58 * TheJollyRoger staggers back in.
04:37:12 <TheJollyRoger> ffff: you'll need to message anupritaisno1[m] for details on the testing builds for the 4a5G.
04:38:28 <TheJollyRoger> Testing is a bit of a committment, so just bear that in mind.
04:38:40 * TheJollyRoger stretches and yawns.
04:39:03 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off, I'll see you later! Welcome aboard the ship!
04:55:24 <M1f4a9[m]> Thank you to whoever added the "END SESSION" button to GrapheneOS!
05:53:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> ffff: you can only join over matrix
05:53:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Freenode is unsupported as we use e2ee for the channel
06:00:01 <CaptainBlackton> Thanks <TheJollyRoger>, and sorry if this question constitutes off-topic. I thought my question was "GrapheneOS" topic because it's about how to use the OS. It sounds like you're saying that putting a SIM card in should be safe, but I can also move to off-topic if that would help. I think it would really help to clarify for all users what exactly this channel is for, or add some simple criteria for deciding
06:00:01 <CaptainBlackton> when your topic is becoming too tangential for this channel, so users can learn to self-censor better. Scanning through the chat history here, I see a LOT of requests to move to off-topic, but I feel that many of them probably did not think their was off-topic when asked.
06:00:58 <rny> CaptainBlackton: the crtieria is already pretty simple
06:01:22 <rny> if the user asks questions about how to use a particular OS feature or to seek clarification about a specific OS feature/issue, its on-topic
06:01:47 <rny> if its beyond the scope of the OS and goes on a tangent to discuss implications of specific issues that is covered beyond the scope of the OS, then it is off-topic
06:03:41 <somenerd[m]> sometimes people move earlier than expected if they feel that the topic would move off topic
06:14:12 <oldman_newuser> Hello all.  I have a question about releases.  Currently on https://grapheneos.org/releases the beta release seems to be the sames as the stable release for pixel3xl.  is this true ?
06:16:37 <rny> oldman_newuser: when beta has been sufficiently tested, stable will match it
06:18:38 <oldman_newuser> thanks for the reply.  Currently both versions state Version: RQ1A.210105.003.2021.01.05.03.  So are they the same ? My goal is the wait for a release that has this commit in it .  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Dialer/commit/0d8292da5563eec6014986a126bc7affcd0a0310
06:19:36 <oldman_newuser> trying to figure out if I need to installl 'beta' or 'stable' when it finally hits.  they both look the same to me currently.  I am sure I am missing something
06:22:04 <CaptainBlackton> OK, <rny>, maybe I'm not looking at the right topic then; when I join the channel, it tells me the topic is: "GrapheneOS Official Channel." Not sure where you are getting all of those criteria out of those three words, but maybe there is somewhere else I should be looking that goes into more detail on what the topic is. Assuming this is the case, I'm just suggesting that it be clearer to people joining the
06:22:04 <CaptainBlackton> channel where to read the more detailed topic requirements.
06:23:13 <take_a_deep_brea> CaptainBlackton: you could refer to the irc-rules.txt
06:23:35 <rny> CaptainBlackton: Rule #2 in the rules URL
06:23:50 <take_a_deep_brea> that makes the distinction between the rooms more clear , although in an indirect manner .
06:24:42 <rny> in any case, the advice served to redirect questions to the offtopic channel is almost always given without hostility.
06:24:57 <take_a_deep_brea> yes.
06:29:16 <squairron[m]> Would you guys recommend putting closed source apps like Spotify or Instagram in a separate user profile?
06:30:42 <rny> squairron[m]: it'd depend on your threat model, if you are concerned about an app learning about what other apps you have installed, yes you can put them in a separate user profile.
06:32:01 <take_a_deep_brea> squairron:  it depends on the app itself . you can always check what kind of permissions the app requests in the play store website if its available there  . in case the app asks for too many questionable permissions then sure . this is true regardless of wether the app is open/closed source
06:32:01 <rny> apps can call `getInstalledApplications()` to learn what other apps you have installed in the current user profile
06:32:25 <squairron[m]> Okay thank you guys
06:34:57 <take_a_deep_brea> i recommend not trusting apps based on the way they are developed . the only thing that matters is permissions used by the app , target sdk version , how actively the app is developed , and how open are  the devs to feedback from users .
06:36:06 <take_a_deep_brea> there are open sourced apps out there that suck at most of these things .
06:36:33 <squairron[m]> Okay thank you! And I have two more questions that are unrelated, 1. Is there a way to duplicate a profile, so I don't have to configure all of my preferred preferences? 2. Is there a way to have Vanadium never save the history/always be in incognito
06:39:29 <rny> 1. no way to duplicate. 2. use incognito mode
06:40:21 <squairron[m]> Okay thank you and I meant a setting to have incognito by default so I don't have to open a incognito tab everytime
06:40:22 <rny> 2. when you open an incognito tab, there will be column of incognito tabs
06:40:24 <take_a_deep_brea> if that is a feature you absolutely need you can use bromite browser
06:40:39 <take_a_deep_brea> for incognito browsing by  default .
06:40:55 <rny> when you're actively using the incognito tab, all new tabs you open will be incognito
06:41:28 <squairron[m]> Oh okay true and thank you for both of your suggestions
06:41:58 <CaptainBlackton> OK, thanks <rny>. I have distinctly been looking out for hostility here, as I came here from a very hostile experience at LineageOS. But I am glad to say that I have not sensed hostility in this channel, from your or anyone else. Sometimes it's hard to tell someone's tone by reading text, so I hope no one thinks I am trying to be hostile either.
06:42:31 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that people are thinking that you're hostile
06:42:41 <take_a_deep_brea> though there is an  issue  for vanadium  with enhancement tag that does the same thing  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/65
06:44:45 <take_a_deep_brea> CaptainBlackton:  my own personal experience in this room has been great and  can vouch the same for you . just that sometimes people ignore the second rule and get over-emotional when reminded of the same .
06:46:09 <take_a_deep_brea> as far as i know no one has ever been snubbed for asking a question that was answered in the FAQ (while they knew the FAQ  existed , i've done that too ) which is a violation of Rule #1 .
06:47:20 <somenerd[m]> yeah my own experience has been pretty good
06:47:37 <rny> idk why the enchancement is necessary when it already has that capability once you create the first incognito tab
06:48:03 <louipc> CaptainBlackton: type /topic to see detailed channel topic btw
06:48:04 <rny> and its a fair assumption that most users default to browsing in cognito mode
06:48:23 <rny> otherwise, it'd be terribly inconvenient to browse with a forgetful browser
06:48:37 <somenerd[m]> > CaptainBlackton: type /topic to see detailed channel topic btw
06:48:37 <somenerd[m]> it gets it on irc too?
06:48:38 <somenerd[m]> cool
06:48:41 <take_a_deep_brea> rny:  i try to ignore it but its a bit of a pita to open incognito every time . especially when clicking on links from other apps
06:48:49 <louipc> somenerd[m]: yes
06:49:16 <somenerd[m]> I think that the irc-matrix bridge is the best one
06:49:25 <somenerd[m]> retaining a majority of the features
06:49:28 <somenerd[m]> offtopic though
06:49:38 <rny> the webview is incognito no?
06:50:13 <rny> oh nvm, take_a_deep_brea i understand what you mean
06:50:36 <take_a_deep_brea> <rny "otherwise, it'd be terribly inco"> one way  i have found to handle that is to have a text file somewhere with urls you like to have around for later. anything you dont save there does not matter to you
06:50:45 <take_a_deep_brea> > <@freenode_rny:matrix.org> otherwise, it'd be terribly inconvenient to browse with a forgetful browser
06:50:45 <take_a_deep_brea>  * one way  i have found to handle that is to have a text file somewhere with urls i like to have around for later. anything you dont save there does not matter to you
07:09:24 <take_a_deep_brea> having too many tabs open does not add much value imo . it only adds to the startup time of browser .
07:09:53 <somenerd[m]> yeah but it's mostly like "I may want to switch to this tab soon"
07:11:09 <CaptainBlackton> And thank you <take_a_deep_brea> for the irc-rules. I just read that and it was very helpful. And I have actually read the FAQ several times, but have not always understood the ramifications. Such as the question I just asked about using a SIM card. I understood that calls and texts should not be considered secure, but I wasn't clear if having a SIM card could be a risk beyond just having calls overheard or
07:11:10 <CaptainBlackton> whatever.
07:11:48 <CaptainBlackton> OK, one other question, which I hope is on-topic. Is a SIM card required for location?
07:11:55 <somenerd[m]> no
07:12:24 <somenerd[m]> also the other docs are also helpful, you may want to read them
07:12:33 <CaptainBlackton> Oh, what other docs?
07:13:09 <somenerd[m]> I meant the rest of the website
07:13:33 <somenerd[m]> and the auditor docs
07:14:16 <CaptainBlackton> What are the auditor docs?
07:14:31 <take_a_deep_brea> well the https://grapheneos.org https://attestation.app/about
07:15:04 <take_a_deep_brea> these two sites cover a lot of ground by themselves
07:15:25 <somenerd[m]> the android dev site and the source site are decent too
07:15:36 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
07:16:45 <CaptainBlackton> OK, thanks <take_a_deep_brea>! I started reading, and will take a deeper look later. At first glance it looks really interesting/useful.
07:16:45 <somenerd[m]> hello
07:18:09 <take_a_deep_brea> welcome.
07:22:24 <CaptainBlackton> BTW, I read something like, "don't expect this OS to make your battery last any longer," but my battery just lasted about 3 weeks. I had unplugged it to go take on a vacation back in December, then forgot it in my car until just this week, and it still had 9% battery left! That is amazing, and I would say unheard of! Good work getting rid of all that wifi-scanning and whatever else usually eats up the battery!
07:22:50 <somenerd[m]> where did you read it?
07:23:16 <somenerd[m]> AOSP is fully degoogled, so the changes are mostly hardening
07:23:45 <CaptainBlackton> I can't remember, as it was maybe a month or two ago, but I remember wondering why it WOULDN'T make the battery last longer. Apparently it has though!
07:25:22 <CaptainBlackton> Well I also have a LineageOS phone with similar specs as my GrapheneOS phone, but that one dies in less than a day.
07:27:47 <mynacol[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mynacol: Well, the drivers are a"> Thanks for the answer. At least the drivers are open source
07:50:13 <squairron[m]> Should I worry about Vanadium's unique fingerprint? I would use Tor Browser, but people say that there are security issues. Is the fingerprint a big deal when it comes to privacy?
07:59:42 <take_a_deep_brea> squairron:  maybe this will help you https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
08:02:22 <squairron[m]> Thank you I will take a look
08:03:43 <take_a_deep_brea> in case it does not answer your query you are (ofcourse) free to ask here again.
08:04:30 <pichtron> gps synchronise with google servers on grapheneos ?
08:05:28 <pichtron> or grapheneos maintain a ping on a google servers where online ?
08:05:37 <pichtron> totaly degoogled ?
08:05:58 <pichtron> NTP servers google ?
08:07:12 <mynacol[m]> pichtron: Look here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
08:07:52 <squairron[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "in case it does not answer your "> Thank you! It cleared up a lot of my questions! What browser do you use daily? And is the security difference between Vanadium and Bromite significant? What are the chances that Bromite will fail to offer the same protection and Vanadium?
08:08:04 <pichtron> thank you very much mynacol[m]
08:09:28 <take_a_deep_brea> squairron: we are better off discussing this in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:10:03 <squairron[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "squairron: we are better off dis"> Okay sounds good I moved there
09:22:46 <sierocharlie[m]> How to disable the screen time out?
09:22:59 <take_a_deep_brea> lock screen time out ?
09:23:13 <sierocharlie[m]> Let me correct myself, I mean the clock that appears. I just want a dark screen.
09:23:55 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont understand , the clock that appears on lock screen ?
09:24:09 <sierocharlie[m]> No, the clock that appears after inactivity.
09:24:19 <take_a_deep_brea> that is a part of screen saver
09:24:33 <take_a_deep_brea> you can disable screen saver
09:24:43 <take_a_deep_brea> entirely.
09:24:48 <sierocharlie[m]> My screensaver is off
09:24:52 <sierocharlie[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "entirely."> How?
09:25:25 <mynacol[m]> @sierocharlie It's always on display
09:25:40 <mynacol[m]> In the settings is a switch
09:25:51 <take_a_deep_brea> settings > display> screen saver
09:26:10 <sierocharlie[m]> When to start: Never is enabled
09:26:20 <take_a_deep_brea> lol .
09:26:30 <take_a_deep_brea> then i have no clue .
09:26:47 <take_a_deep_brea> could you send a screenshot or something
09:27:55 <sierocharlie[m]> My screensaver is set to clock. (you cannot unclick that.)
09:27:55 <sierocharlie[m]> Then when to enable is set to: Never
09:27:55 <sierocharlie[m]> On the display settingspage it even says. Screensaver: Off
09:28:08 <sierocharlie[m]> Yet, I get the clock after 1 minute of inactivity.
09:28:41 <sierocharlie[m]> The clock after inactivity doesn't seem to be related to the screensaver setting as even though I for example set the screensaver to display colors of a photo album it will still show the clock.
09:28:57 <sierocharlie[m]> So my question is: How do I disable the clock that appears after inactivity (not touching your screen)
09:29:00 <mynacol[m]> Display -> lock screen -> always on display
09:29:09 <take_a_deep_brea> hmm yeah .
09:29:47 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks mynacol
09:47:44 <datacloud[m]> The name of this room has changed, why?
09:50:02 <take_a_deep_brea> what do you think it was before ? i am not sure that it has changed.

09:53:53 <datacloud[m]> If I'm not wrong,  this is the GraphenOS room, but the name has changed. I'm not possible to change it ; -)
09:55:19 <somenerd[m]> it's probably a bug
09:55:33 <somenerd[m]> matrix is really bugged
09:57:28 * Pratyush[m] uploaded an image: PXL_20210119_094806202.jpg (60KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cRagBksNAgGSkRzEpBKeQfWX/PXL_20210119_094806202.jpg >
09:58:01 <Pratyush[m]> Oh boy, received new pixel put graphene on it. Now i am done with life.🤩
09:59:21 <take_a_deep_brea> some would say your life just started . well , great to have one more  graphene user !
10:01:18 <take_a_deep_brea> data.cloud:  i was thinking along the lines of some chhange in spelling or capitalization. i dont remember such a radical change.
10:44:12 <datacloud[m]> ?
10:45:59 <take_a_deep_brea> data.cloud: i meant the name never changed from the one you think it was to GrapheneOS. it has always been GrapheneOS .
10:55:08 <datacloud[m]> Now is back, everything is good. Maybe a client issue. Sorry
10:56:00 <somenerd[m]> yeah element is sorta buggy
11:07:35 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem , data.cloud: .
11:40:03 <datacloud[m]> Does anyone know when GraphenOS will support the new Pixel 5? I heard about delay, but no information about planned schedule...
11:41:20 <somenerd[m]> there is no planned schedule
11:41:36 <somenerd[m]> it depends on maintainers stepping up to test GrapheneOS
11:42:42 <datacloud[m]> There is no roadmap or similar?
11:42:47 <rny> no roadmap
11:43:15 <rny> roadmaps require salaries
11:43:22 <rny> heh
11:44:04 <datacloud[m]> I don't think, more "time management" :-D
11:44:55 <chris42[m]> No hands no cookies... Time management can't compensate for missing programmers and maintainers
11:52:06 <rny> if its a critical feature, someone would have implemented it already
11:52:26 <rny> or offered a lot of money to make it happen

13:24:38 <nick_bk[m]> <frontman[m]1 "nick_bk:  4: modify os keyboard "> fuck passwords.
13:27:54 <Golli[m]1> Recently, I've been using printed off QR codes to store my stupidly long passwords on and it's working great.
13:27:55 <Golli[m]1> Having something like an "on boot" or profile unlock system for QR codes would be quite nice.
13:27:55 <Golli[m]1> But then again, I also want things like dummy pin's which delete phone/profile data and open a "dummy" profile.
13:29:39 <somenerd[m]> > With point 2, do you mean that if you enter a specific pin that it'll show a different/other specific user?
13:29:39 <somenerd[m]> I remember strcat commenting on point 2
13:29:44 <somenerd[m]> one min let me check logbot
13:30:31 <somenerd[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201025#c5588637
13:30:37 <nick_bk[m]> there is ARM TEE to store passwords, all you need to secure is phone access
13:32:12 <somenerd[m]> in short it's not deniable after decrypting everything else
13:43:35 <nick_bk[m]> <somenerd[m] "in short it's not deniable after"> what do you mean?
13:43:48 <somenerd[m]> read the messages
13:43:59 <somenerd[m]> there would be remaining encrypted content
13:44:06 <ogre> hey everyone
13:44:32 <somenerd[m]> hello
13:45:04 <ogre> so im installing grapheneos for a pixel 3a and im stuck at "< waiting for device >" when inputting "fastboot flashing unlock"
13:45:08 <ogre> any clues?
13:52:52 <darkharbingeroft> Would you back a phone built from the ground up for security and privacy running GrapheneOS?
13:53:03 <somenerd[m]> sorry idk how i can help
13:53:08 <somenerd[m]> I'd wait for more people to come
13:53:14 <darkharbingeroft> If it came up on Kickstarter
13:53:21 <somenerd[m]> > Would you back a phone built from the ground up for security and privacy running GrapheneOS?
13:53:22 <somenerd[m]> it's actually in the roadmap
13:53:28 <somenerd[m]> so if you donate to GrapheneOS
13:53:37 <somenerd[m]> it indirectly helps with custom hardware
13:54:04 <darkharbingeroft> I wanna help more directly
13:54:28 <frontman[m]1> nick_bk: nah, I don't like u2f or pattern
13:55:02 <somenerd[m]> > I wanna help more directly
13:55:02 <somenerd[m]> there isn't a kickstarter yet afaik
13:56:18 <Albakham[m]> It'd be great if some company decided to work with you
13:56:18 <Albakham[m]> I definitely don't imagine Google though
13:57:09 <Albakham[m]> <darkharbingeroft "I wanna help more directly"> You can develop for grapheneos!
13:57:14 <frontman[m]1> Golli: I want a dummy PIN. thats a great idea.
13:58:42 <somenerd[m]> that actually doesn't work if the person decided to investigate further
13:58:47 <somenerd[m]> check strcat's comment here
13:58:53 <somenerd[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201025#c5588637
14:01:33 <somenerd[m]>  * that actually doesn't work apparently if the person decides to investigate further
14:30:52 <Golli[m]1> I'm not terribly familiar with the way FBE works, but would you not be able to "format" that section of storage?
15:11:02 <theOne[m]> Hello
15:15:38 <theOne[m]> Is it possible to flash grapheneos using a virtual machine? And if so, can it be setup in such a way where my device doesnt infect the host via the usb?
15:28:05 <deappledapple> Not recommended, but you can go try it yourself. Verified boot, then Auditor catches if there was tampering done in OS flashing anwyays
15:28:20 <deappledapple> See: grapheneos.org/install
15:29:09 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Not recommended, but you can go "> https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites, second paragraph rather
15:39:51 <theOne[m]>  Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: im asking because i still managed to pass the boot, and then the tampering seemed to get worse. Now its failing audit i'd like to flash again but not pass anything to the machine.
15:40:31 <theOne[m]> Edit: i still managed to pass the initial audit.
15:40:50 <deappledapple> Oh, welp, try flashing it from the bare OS (no VM and stuff)?
15:41:13 <theOne[m]> I mean my first flash was without a vm
15:41:53 <theOne[m]> Hmm ill try and update my results
15:42:05 <theOne[m]> Ive already sent samples remotely hoping it helps
15:42:55 <deappledapple> What does the error say?
15:43:16 <deappledapple> <theOne[m] "Ive already sent samples remotel"> Remote samples are for new device support in Auditor iirc
15:43:54 <deappledapple> https://attestation.app/tutorial#expanding-device-support
15:43:59 <deappledapple> Oh, I mixed it up nvm
15:44:05 <deappledapple> You mean remote attestation then?
15:44:12 <theOne[m]> Yes
15:44:55 <theOne[m]> Pretty sure they'll see it all
15:45:57 <deappledapple> Need to send two successful remote attestation
15:46:10 <deappledapple> Set it to 1hr for fastest result of the 2nd pairing
15:46:29 <theOne[m]> Ok
15:46:37 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Set it to 1hr for fastest result"> attestation.app/about
15:49:07 <theOne[m]> Whats funny is , the remote pairing result doesnt say anything is wrong
15:49:11 <theOne[m]> The local one is
15:49:28 <theOne[m]> I just noticed it now
15:50:09 <theOne[m]> Amazing
15:57:12 <fll[m]> <theOne[m] "Whats funny is , the remote pair"> Maybe it's me not understanding correctly, but the attestation can only see tampering after the first pairing. So if you paired the remote after the local one was already complaining it wouldn't see it.
15:59:42 <fll[m]> <fll[m] "Maybe it's me not understanding "> first=initial
16:02:46 <theOne[m]> Anyways, i will see how i go. If anyone has any experience with safely plugging a device without passing problems to the machine and network, please feel free to mention me so i get the notification. Thx
16:03:31 <theOne[m]> I may go and get a pixel 4 instead. The 3 xl only has a year of support left
16:04:15 <wesder4[m]> Will the 5 be supported by the end of support for the 3xl?
16:04:51 <theOne[m]> I hear the 5 has great battery life compared to the 4
16:05:52 <strcat> theOne[m]: the remote service shows you the last successful attestation
16:05:55 <strcat> it doesn't show failed ones
16:06:04 <strcat> it can't currently tie those to a specific device
16:06:13 <strcat> it's not supposed to show failed ones atm
16:06:28 <strcat> the purpose of it is to warn you if the device stops sending successful attestations
16:06:53 <theOne[m]> strcat: that explains everything
16:06:57 <theOne[m]> Thanks
17:01:52 <println> Hi everyone, I want to ask a question about graphene (actually i think android in general).  If i don't give access (mic/cameras) to apps, there is other ways somone can use them? (without having phisical access to the phone)
17:02:16 <println> if this is offtopic i switch immediatly
17:11:15 <nscnt[m]> println: No, there's no other way someone can use them. There could be an exploit in any way, but due to all mitigations on Android, it's very very unlikely.
17:12:20 <nscnt[m]> Maybe through IPC, but your question wasn't very specific.
17:12:49 <nscnt[m]> Not sure who "someone" should be
17:13:09 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont think there is not much point in a permission toggle if it couldnt disable all possible ways to access that resource.
17:15:01 <nscnt[m]> That's part of the platform's security model. The user needs to give his consent. If he doesn't, X won't happen
17:20:41 <println> ok this ^ help me, so if somone doesnt  install a malicious app or give it  information / granting it access to sensitive permissions, it's not possible to take control of the phone (I'm talking really in general, like defense from a cyberattak or a journalist that need to protect sensitive data), i can't be more precise
17:24:16 <banjo[m]> println: well Putin uses mechanical typewriters for sensitive stuff in Kremlin. that shiul tell you what you need to know.
17:24:33 <banjo[m]> * println: well Putin uses mechanical typewriters for sensitive stuff in Kremlin. that should tell you all you need to know.
17:24:42 <nscnt[m]> It's not able to take control over the phone, yes. There are several reasons for it. Apps are running in a sandbox, each app has its own storage, they aren't able to read/write data without the user's explicit consent, etc.
17:24:47 <println> not that sensitive i guess
17:24:53 <println> but yeah
17:25:32 <nscnt[m]>  * It's not able to take control over the phone, yes. There are several reasons for it. Apps are running in a sandbox, each app has its own storage, they aren't able to read/write shared storage without the user's explicit consent, etc.
17:28:12 <strcat[m]> @room btw, due to https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1194 Matrix users will be kicked after 30 days of not speaking in the channel, please just rejoin the channel if that happens, need to try to get them to prioritize fixing this
17:28:41 <strcat[m]> it does NOT mean the moderators kicked you, Matrix IRC bridge bot kicks anyone who doesn't speak for 30 days, it sucks, I know
17:29:09 <faxing[m]> oh
17:29:10 <faxing[m]> weird
17:29:10 <strcat[m]> channel would be a lot bigger if it wasn't an issue
17:29:10 <johnschmidt[m]> Ok
17:29:17 <crog[m]> Ok
17:29:45 <strcat[m]> lot of ppl message me wondering why they got kicked
17:30:58 <JeremiahK[m]> Resetting my 30 days
17:30:59 <take_a_deep_brea> well , that is unfortunate .a suggestion : add it to irc-rules.txt ?
17:31:37 <banjo[m]> then they go around saying that the community is hostile lol
17:32:13 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
17:32:33 <theOne[m]> You guys are toxic :)
17:32:46 <theOne[m]> Thats what i read somewhere
17:33:12 <take_a_deep_brea> where ? please link such things .
17:33:12 <subtleparty[m]> .
17:33:22 <M109ftw[m]> Bot is toxic trying to kick us all. This is how it begins, skynet is next.
17:33:35 <strcat[m]> you can just rejoin after it kicks you but it's a real annoyance for people who lurk
17:33:42 <banjo[m]> theOne: stop reading all you read
17:33:44 <strcat[m]> since every 30 days they get kicked and have to rejoin
17:33:45 <strcat[m]> and a lot of ppl seem to think mods kicked them
17:33:46 <theOne[m]> No need. I said it with humor, i don't wish to make it trouble
17:33:51 <strcat[m]> when the bridge bot does it
17:34:00 <edgar1[m]> N
17:34:03 <strcat[m]> @appservice-irc:matrix.org bot
17:34:05 <take_a_deep_brea> nah , we understand, theOne:
17:34:19 <ruski[m]> only such bad hackers like grapheneos can write a bot that does something toxic like automatically kicking people from the chat!
17:34:34 <take_a_deep_brea> ruski: a joke , right ?
17:34:45 <theOne[m]> Lol
17:35:12 <banjo[m]> yeah we chill homie
17:35:16 <theOne[m]> Its nice to know its not a channel full of bots at lest
17:35:27 <ruski[m]> i'm a bot too
17:35:35 <Mathijs[m]> <strcat[m] "@room btw, due to https://github"> Yeah, that's a freenode limitation, not a matrix one
17:36:05 <banjo[m]> on soviet matrix the bots kick you
17:37:10 <theOne[m]> Where do i check for updates on new bugs or vulnerabilities in the OS with each release?
17:37:36 <lolrepeatlol[m]> okay thanks
17:37:48 <theOne[m]> Do i have to be on github
17:42:16 <take_a_deep_brea> theOne: no need to have github account
17:42:40 <take_a_deep_brea> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
17:43:56 <take_a_deep_brea> btw this is not per release
17:45:39 <take_a_deep_brea> for stuff thats been fixed this https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog should be useful
18:13:14 <frostedpanel[m]> <strcat[m] "@room btw, due to https://github"> I have spoken 😀
18:13:33 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: it's not a freenode limitation
18:13:42 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: freenode doesn't require that they kick idle users or specify how to do it
18:13:49 <Fragaria[m]> .
18:14:07 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: the current issue is that they have performance issues with the bridge so they didn't ship the fix avoiding kicking idle users
18:14:26 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: the Matrix developers at one point said something about freenode but they were mixing up freenode with *channel moderators*
18:14:56 <strcat[m]> it's certain channel moderators who don't want people being able to see the channel without being shown to be in the channel
18:15:24 <strcat[m]> that's why Matrix doesn't simply remove your username from IRC while letting you stay on the Matrix side, and then reconnect your username to IRC if you say something
18:15:25 <strcat[m]> that would be the ideal fix
18:15:27 <Mathijs[m]> <strcat[m] "Mathijs: freenode doesn't requir"> It's part of the agreement between matrix and freenode
18:15:31 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: it's not
18:15:49 <strcat[m]> the freenode admins responded and said it wasn't
18:16:31 <strcat[m]> they don't require Matrix to kick idle users, Matrix could remove them from the channel on the IRC side without kicking them (and reconnect them if they say something)
18:16:47 <strcat[m]> certain channel moderators don't want that - but we'd be fine with that, and it's a lot better than people being kicked
18:16:58 <strcat[m]> also they don't have to kick idle users per any agreement but rather they have a limited number of permitted connections
18:17:09 <strcat[m]> they can choose what is considered idle
18:17:36 <strcat[m]> that issue I linked above is about treating sending read receipts as not being idle, and they implemented it (please look at the issue) but they didn't ship it due to performance issues with the Matrix IRC bridge
18:17:47 <strcat[m]> so it seems they won't ship it until they optimize it which doesn't look like a priority for them
18:18:04 <strcat[m]> and even then it's still going to kick idle users but at least it won't kick people for not speaking if they ship that fix
18:19:02 <strcat[m]> Mathijs: it's a Matrix issue, and part of the issue is them not distinguishing between what freenode wants (limited # of connections) and what *certain* channels want (not letting people see the channel without being visible in it - which just seems weird to me, it's a public channel people can log / share)
18:19:47 <strcat[m]> they could make the logging thing an option and channels not caring about it could avoid having people kicked (rather, just disconnected from the IRC channel, but still able to see everything and talk - which would reconnect them on the IRC side)
18:20:04 <strcat[m]> it's part of the general issue of Matrix having a lot of usability issues
18:20:10 <strcat[m]> it cannot be blamed on freenode
18:20:20 <strcat[m]> freenode admins replied and clarified
18:50:03 <jonmonty[m]> Quick question. Once a device is no longer supported by Graphene what is the best option to continue using that device. Should lineage be flashed so the device can still receive newer android versions? Or should I stay on the last build of Graphene?
19:02:21 <strcat> we don't drop support for devices until they've become totally insecure
19:02:30 <strcat> the only good option is using a secure device
19:03:13 <strcat> if you're talking about the Pixel 2, the last possible patch level is 2020-11-01 (2020-10-05 was the last stock OS patch level)
19:03:20 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/releases#taimen-stable we've still been doing releases for them
19:03:24 <strcat> but it's insecure
19:03:29 <strcat> we can't fix that
19:03:36 <strcat> no amount of work we do could
19:05:56 <banjo[m]> this is why I like this project. straight cold truth. concise and to the point. no bullshit maybe and perhaps.
19:08:00 <jonmonty[m]> <strcat "we don't drop support for device"> Got it just gotta upgrade. Thanks
19:08:34 <strcat[m]> jonmonty: we still essentially 'support' the Pixel 2 but it doesn't meet the requirement to be considered official GrapheneOS support and it's a really low priority
19:08:56 <strcat[m]> when I have time, I update the special extended support release branch for it based on the main one and make a release
19:09:02 <strcat[m]> but it's separate from the official releases and isn't secure
19:09:18 <strcat[m]> people could contribute to fixing more stuff for it but... nothing that can be done will make it secure
19:09:44 <strcat[m]> could continue doing the extended support releases until Android 12 but I don't want to encourage people to keep using it
19:09:51 <strcat[m]>  * could continue doing the extended support releases for a long time but I don't want to encourage people to keep using it
19:10:45 <jonmonty[m]> <strcat[m] "could continue doing the extende"> OK so it would be best to to continue to use Graphene until you can upgrade asap
19:11:01 <jonmonty[m]> Right?
19:11:07 <strcat[m]> yeah for now we are still doing releases for it, but it's insecure
19:11:11 <strcat[m]> it won't be better to use something else
19:11:32 <strcat[m]> we've dropped support from the main branch and any hacks needed to support it are in a separate 11-wahoo branch for it
19:11:38 <strcat[m]> and it's considered unofficial support now
19:11:42 <strcat[m]> not real GrapheneOS anymore
19:11:58 <strcat[m]> because it can't meet our standards
19:12:00 <strcat[m]> that's all
19:12:26 <jonmonty[m]> Got it and its insecure cause Google is no longer pushing new builds of aosp for it yes?
19:12:47 <strcat[m]> doesn't have to do with AOSP
19:12:52 <strcat[m]>  * doesn't really have to do with AOSP
19:13:03 <strcat[m]> jonmonty: the SoC is no longer supported
19:13:22 <strcat[m]> the stock OS no longer has releases for it, there isn't any active development or support for firmware, drivers, etc.
19:13:40 <strcat[m]> we can't replace / update firmware ourselves even with substantially more resources
19:14:01 <strcat[m]> in theory could take over maintaining drivers with a bunch of full-time devs but why?
19:14:03 <strcat[m]> it's insecure regardless
19:14:14 <strcat[m]> and the device is aging in terms of security expectations anyway
19:14:23 <strcat[m]> even if it was supported, it doesn't meet our current standards for devices
19:14:48 <jonmonty[m]> <strcat[m] "even if it was supported, it doe"> Is that partially because it's lacks the Titan M chip?
19:15:17 <curios12345[m]> Is NextDNS the best privacy oriented dns? Or is better cloudflare 1.1.1.1?
19:15:38 <strcat[m]> jonmonty: partly
19:15:43 <strcat[m]> it has a secure element but it's only used for Weaver with insider attack protection
19:15:55 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have StrongBox keystore, etc.
19:16:00 <strcat[m]> not the only reason though
19:16:29 <jonmonty[m]> BTW thankyou for such an in depth reply I really appreciate the transparency and communication
19:16:35 <strcat[m]> also it's possible the NXP secure element it has is vulnerable to those NXP secure element issues that were discovered - although that's just a physical security issue and I'm unsure what chip it uses and if that's relevant to it
19:16:56 <strcat[m]> it MAY weaken the protection it provides against brute forcing passphrases with physical access though
19:17:36 <strcat[m]> the bigger issue is that it's missing firmware updates and support for the software device support
19:23:30 <XenoProteinz> Hallo
19:46:38 <JJ1013> Greetings...
19:50:57 <Half-Shot> aha, here i am
19:51:00 <Half-Shot> here now Mathijs
19:51:33 <JJ1013> I have a question about GrapheneOS. Since it is only officially compatible with Google Pixel, does it neutralize the backdoors and surveillant microcode from the SoC/CPU of the Google Pixel?
19:53:04 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> Do you have proof or backdoor on the pixels?
19:55:53 <TheJollyRoger> There aren't backdoors and surveillant microcode on the Pixels. It would make no sense for Google to put them there.
19:59:17 <matthias-beep[m]> going with conspiracy theories only someone that has a particular interest in having surveillant microcode on the pixels would said such a thing ;)
20:00:40 <matthias-beep[m]> #tinfoil
20:00:47 <TheJollyRoger> Well, you're more than welcome to port it to the Altair 8800.
20:03:49 <strcat[m]> the SoC is a Snapdragon anyway, we would likely have the same SoC if we had our own device
20:04:15 <strcat[m]> we'd probably always use the highest-end one though because the cost would be insignificant compared to other things
20:05:02 <TheJollyRoger> If we were going to make our own hardware, let me know what form factor you want, what components we're going to work with and I'd love to do a couple designs.
20:07:40 <TheJollyRoger> I have a few ideas for a diecast magnesium alloy skeletized frame with a molded 35% glass filled polypthalamide body. It won't be the prettiest thing around but far likely to shatter into pieces like a glass body if it falls out of your pocket while running down the concrete steps of your front apartment for the bus in the morning.
20:07:55 <TheJollyRoger> *but far less likely to shatter into pieces
20:10:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: android TV running grapheneos
20:11:07 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Out of curiosity, would you consider it a selling point if I designed it so that it doubles as a ballistic shield?
20:11:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sure why not
20:11:40 <blk> anupritaisno1: +1
20:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> Bwahahahahaha :D
20:12:29 <TheJollyRoger> Depending on how much coverage you guys want I think I could get it to around NIJ level III/A before it becomes too awkward to carry.
20:13:35 <TheJollyRoger> Mind you though, the screen covering is going to need to be at least 3/4" thick ballistic polycarbonate, with around a 1" thick bezel (polycarbonate is only bullet proof if it's properly fixtured, so I can't make the screen bezel-less.)
20:14:19 <TheJollyRoger> To prevent the screen from scratching I can add 1/8" thick tempered glass overtop for optical clarity and to keep the dust off the polycarbonate.
20:19:22 <Albert> has anyone been successful installing GraphenOS on their Pixel 2 XL?  nothing happens when i click on flash-all
20:19:47 <blk> click on?
20:19:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Albert, many people have, but you need to follow the instructions properly.
20:20:14 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 2XL is also now end of life, it is no longer supported, and its patch level is now at November 2020.
20:20:22 <TheJollyRoger> So I would suggest not using it anymore.
20:20:55 <Albert> ok, i'll stick with LineageOS, thanks
20:20:55 <TheJollyRoger> Both the vendor and upstream have since abandoned it, the only reason GrapheneOS shipped an update to it last week was to buy more time for existing 2/2XL owners to buy a newer device.
20:21:09 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck.
20:21:13 <Albert> thanks
20:23:53 <blk> strcat was recently talking about the possibility of a web-based replacement for fastboot. Is that idea still incubating?
20:24:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> blk: yes
20:24:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have a working demo
20:24:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hey blk, help is wanted there, desperately, if you're able to help with it, or you know someone who can, it'd be greatly appreciated!
20:25:00 <blk> Is the demo available? Sounds very interesting
20:27:04 <strcat[m]> blk: there's someone that's going to be working on it now
20:27:23 <strcat[m]> the demo just does unlock / lock
20:27:26 <strcat[m]> doesn't flash anything
20:34:41 <Callahan> Does anyone have any recommendations for Contact apps? I think the simplest option is for the contact app to store locally and then I handle the backup via other means. However, all the contact apps I have used, seem to store the contacts in an SQLite or similar DB and in a location I can't easily find. Anyone have any contact apps they're happy
20:34:41 <Callahan> enough with?
20:35:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Callahan, I uh... I just use the one that came with GrapheneOS. Since that one gets backed up by Seedvault. I know it isn't as pretty as the others and really kills the quality of contact photos but it's easy to export and synchronize.
20:37:05 <Callahan> Ah, didn't know about the Seedvault. I shall keep quiet and go look into it more before asking :-)
20:37:09 <Callahan> Thanks
20:37:16 <TheJollyRoger> Sure!
20:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS comes with SeedVault, to go use it, go to SETTINGS -> System -> Backup.
20:37:41 <TheJollyRoger> You will need two things before you do though:
20:37:46 <TheJollyRoger> Er, three.
20:38:13 <TheJollyRoger> The first thing is you're going to need a sheet of durable, thick paper, if you have something like heavy duty cardstock or paperboard, that's ideal.
20:38:53 <TheJollyRoger> The second thing you're going to need is a permanent ink pen, or an archival grade ink pen.
20:39:12 <TheJollyRoger> Don't use gel pens or rollers. Those pen inks are water base and they WILL smear.
20:39:27 <TheJollyRoger> *are water based
20:40:06 <TheJollyRoger> The third thing you're going to need is either a USB drive or a Nextcloud account. Look in the box your phone came in and you should find a USB A to USB C adapter plug for your phone.
20:40:20 <taptapbingo[m]> Hello guys, I'm sorry for my English, can someone integrate one feature, it's be very cool, if we can setup second password and when use these password it will do factory reset
20:40:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hi taptapbingo[m], we've got an issue open for that, help is wanted though.
20:41:47 <TheJollyRoger> taptapbingo[m]: the easiest way to see a feature landed in GrapheneOS is to submit the code to the project, either doing so yourself, or by sponsoring the project by hiring a developer to work on it. Remember, it's an open source project, where everyone sends in code, and the project grows collaboratively as a result, so everyone can use it for free.
20:42:16 <taptapbingo[m]> In my country only this can work
20:44:10 <taptapbingo[m]> TheJollyRoger: thanks I'm try to find someone who can
20:45:54 <TheJollyRoger> taptapbingo[m]: Awesome, good luck! We really would appreciate the help, since this feature has been requested a lot.
20:47:02 <eenno[m]> Callahan: Not a contact app, but check out etesync for syncing contacts (and calendar). That will will work with any calendar app.
20:48:45 <jonmonty[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If we were going to make our own"> Is there any chance of a Graphene OS build for devices like the PinePhone or the Librem 5? Or do those devices not meet the security requirements?
20:49:10 <jonmonty[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I have a few ideas for a diecast"> Original Graphene hardware would be incredible
20:49:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jonmonty[m] "Is there any chance of a Graphen"> They don't
20:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> jonmonty[m]: Those devices don't meet the security requirements, unfortunately. They never will; the Librem5 has its precompiled binary firmware permanently fused into read only memory.
20:51:52 <TheJollyRoger> So even if we wanted to, it's by design an insecure phone.
20:52:59 <Callahan> Thanks eenno[m]
20:53:30 <sierocharlie[m]> By insecure do you mean it doesn't meet the requirements for GrapheneOS to be secure, or that the Librem5 in general is an insecure phone?
20:53:42 <TheJollyRoger> Callahan: make sure you've gotten those things before you use Seedvault, you must not lose the seed! If you do, say goodbye to your backups!
20:54:29 <Callahan> TheJollyRoger: 2 years in Crypto hodling, I'm all over that side of things ;-)
20:54:56 <Callahan> 3 in fact, that last year kinda wizzed past.....
20:56:08 <frontman[m]1> taptapbingo: that would be super neat.
20:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> sierocharlie[m]: I mean both, actually. The Librem 5 is defective by design as an insecure phone. Even if it wasn't for the issue of it using permanently fused firmware to try to game the definition of "Free Software", it doesn't support verified boot, remote attestation, hardware-backed keystore/hardware bound encryption, insider access protection, weaver/strongbox... it's an older chipset and
20:56:12 <TheJollyRoger> may not even support SMMU
20:56:44 <TheJollyRoger> Callahan: whew, good!
20:57:03 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks!
20:57:19 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, yeah, 2020 didn't feel like much of a year, it felt too long in all the wrong ways and felt too short in all the wrong ways too!
20:57:36 <TheJollyRoger> sierocharlie[m]: Anytime! Yeah, the thing is kind of funny...
20:57:59 <sierocharlie[m]> I thought so too! Especially considering the things they "claim" it to be.
20:59:20 <HollowAtom> Yay i did it!
20:59:41 <TheJollyRoger> The FSF say that BootROM is out of spec, so what Purism did was essentially hide all the vendor binaries in read-only memory, load it outside of the host, and declare it to be "BootROM" and therefore out of spec, so they could cheat the definition. But the problem with this is that now you can't update the firmware anymore so that means that the device is essentially permanently vulnerable once
20:59:42 <TheJollyRoger> a vulnerability is found.
21:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> HollowAtom: Ahoy! I presume you just installed GrapheneOS? Welcome aboard the ship!
21:00:33 <HollowAtom> yeah, it took me about 3 hours to figure it out, but i got it!
21:00:43 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
21:00:48 <sierocharlie[m]> 3 hours??
21:00:51 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure you've locked the bootloader after installation!
21:00:53 <HollowAtom> (at work)
21:00:55 <HollowAtom> lol
21:00:56 <sierocharlie[m]> Congrats on installing btw! Start of something great..
21:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
21:02:00 <sierocharlie[m]> TheJollyRoger, do you use the default keyboard?
21:02:03 <TheJollyRoger> Now that you're aboard, you can try out Auditor if you want to use the Attestation server at https://attestation.app/tutorial, or if you have a second device.
21:02:03 <HollowAtom> I made a few mistakes, but it wasn't that bad.  I heard about the os on a podcast so i figured i would check it out.
21:02:08 <TheJollyRoger> sierocharlie[m]: yeah, I just use the default keyboard.
21:02:16 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! Where from, if I may?
21:02:32 <HollowAtom> The bottom of Louisiana. 30 miles from the gulf.
21:02:42 <sierocharlie[m]> I find that the keyboard on my Pixel 4a is kind of small compared to my previous phone (which had a smaller but wider screen).
21:02:45 <TheJollyRoger> Er, oh, hahaha ah sorry I meant which podcast, sorry XD
21:02:53 <sierocharlie[m]> lmao
21:02:55 <TheJollyRoger> *blush*
21:04:31 <HollowAtom> No Agenda. The best podcast in the Universe.
21:05:12 <TheJollyRoger> No Agenda! I'll have to go look them up later and tune in!
21:05:36 <HollowAtom> I think you would like it.
21:05:37 <jmacnd> how do I change my callerid from Test to something else in graphene?
21:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent!
21:07:30 <HollowAtom> Is there a FAQ for research available for general questions like the one jmacnd asked?
21:07:51 <TheJollyRoger> There's a faq, just a sec... I don't think it has anything on callerID, I'm just looking now.
21:07:54 <TheJollyRoger> The official FAQ is:
21:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq
21:08:21 <jmacnd> i looked, didn't see anything
21:08:24 <jmacnd> in the FAQ
21:08:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's not there unfortunately, I'm trying to see if that's handled at your carrier.
21:08:37 <jmacnd> plenty of info about android but I don't see the prompts that they talk about
21:09:17 <TheJollyRoger> Since Caller ID is handled by my carrier, I don't think I can actually actually change it from my end, but I don't know about yours. >_<... hopefully someone more knowledegable than I might be able to chime in.
21:10:00 <banjo[m]> <HollowAtom "No Agenda. The best podcast in t"> thanks for that. nice stuff
21:10:06 <HollowAtom> i can change mine on the carrier website, but i was hoping there was a spoofer in there.
21:11:18 <HollowAtom> who is your carrier jmacnd?
21:11:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I unfortunately don't know much about that part :(
21:12:17 <HollowAtom> i had a little fun changing my sons caller id to "mr sparkles"
21:12:23 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
21:12:26 <TheJollyRoger> Oh man that's hilarious.
21:12:27 <banjo[m]> HollowAtom: you might like this

21:12:46 <rny> caller id spoofing is now illegal in some countries
21:12:51 <rny> due to abuse
21:13:03 <banjo[m]> hiding is not
21:13:13 <banjo[m]> in most europe
21:13:43 <HollowAtom> is that an att mvno?
21:13:51 <sierocharlie[m]> There's a difference between spoofing and spoofing with malicious intent.
21:14:10 <HollowAtom> the number is the same, just not the name. That is what makes it the most fun.
21:14:19 <HollowAtom> some might call it abuse....
21:14:37 <sierocharlie[m]> The latter one being illegal in most countries. Spoofing is actually commonly used for many legitimate purposes. Such as your bank calling you from different numbers but it will show you XZY bank
21:14:40 <HollowAtom> agreed.
21:15:01 <HollowAtom> we all know our automobiles extended warranty is expired
21:15:08 <sierocharlie[m]> It can also be abused to call people as their bank while not being their bank in an attempt to gain something. Which is obviously done with malicious intent and is illegal.
21:15:12 <rny> sierocharlie[m]: that is not spoofing
21:15:45 <HollowAtom> I'm not trying to go to jail right.
21:15:52 <rny> that is assuming an identity with authorisation. Spoofing on the other hand is very specific
21:15:55 <HollowAtom> right now
21:16:03 <HollowAtom> Mr sparkles maybe could sue me
21:18:32 <sierocharlie[m]> <rny "@sierocharlie: that is not spoof"> Fair enough.
21:19:48 <rny> spoofing is almost always abused when used in the public network
21:19:58 <rny> and its such a nuisance
21:20:49 <sierocharlie[m]> Is it possible to hide profiles from the lockscreen?
21:20:56 <TheJollyRoger> It happens here a lot, unfortunately.
21:21:59 <sierocharlie[m]> And is the expected result of pressing "Check for updates" for nothing to happen at all unless there's an update? Not even a message that you are all up to date?
21:22:07 <strcat[m]> yes, for now
21:22:16 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks.
21:22:18 <TheJollyRoger> sierocharlie[m]: yeah, for now, the update client doesn't report anything when it checks.
21:22:38 <banjo[m]> if you like sleeping in your own bed, rule of thumb: if it's not yours don't hack it.
21:23:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah really o.O
21:23:32 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/issues/23
21:24:26 <TheJollyRoger> The courts in the United States seem to enjoy making a point of flexing their muscle every time there might be a crime if computers are involved!
21:24:45 <sierocharlie[m]> It is hilarious
21:26:33 <sierocharlie[m]> <sierocharlie[m] "Is it possible to hide profiles "> So this isn't possible?
21:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think so...?
21:26:55 <TheJollyRoger> (But I don't know)
21:28:43 <sierocharlie[m]> Couldn't find a setting for it. Would be cool to be able to hide it from the lockscreen. But hey, I (fortunately) never find myself in countries or situations where people can force me to unlock things.
21:32:18 <HollowAtom> What are the most common apps or functions used that are unique to the OS?
21:33:41 <strcat> unclear what you mean
21:33:45 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/features
21:40:54 <TheJollyRoger> HollowAtom: most of the improvements in GrapheneOS aren't actually user-facing, you won't see them, they're mostly under the hood. A large part of the GrapheneOS philosophy is that security must be transparent; there is no need for it to put on a show for the user.
21:41:33 <HollowAtom> Its not like noscript where you have to allow 10000 things per website? :)
21:42:09 <jonmonty[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The FSF say that BootROM is out "> And what about the pinephone? I thought pine64 keeps all their firmware open
21:43:26 <TheJollyRoger> Many of the improvements have gone into improvements of things like application sandboxing: for instance, one thing exclusive to GrapheneOS is that it spawns new processes rather than simply initialize them the way Zygote does, to prevent processes from leaking secrets to each other. You won't notice this, but it's there.
21:44:30 <TheJollyRoger> jonmonty[m]: It's more or less the same story with Pinephone.
21:45:47 <TheJollyRoger> Many vendors have engaged in systematic openwashing, shading the truth and stopping just short of saying "fully open" knowing that clueless people who want to believe will go the rest of the way for them.
21:48:01 <jonmonty[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Many vendors have engaged in sys"> So the pixel phones have more open and free software than Linux phones? That's ironic
21:50:14 <sierocharlie[m]> Just remembered something, on the topic of caller id. Not actually callerid but anyway. If you have ever called the emergency number with airplane mode on you probably were asked a ton of questons. I did it once at like 2 AM and the operator was all confused why all she could see was the IMEI number.
21:50:25 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome to what's beneath the fine print. Yes, Google phones require signed firmware for the modem, the radios, the SSD, the GPU, etc... but so does *EVERY OTHER PHONE* in existence and anyone who says otherwise is lying to you.
21:51:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, I know that some devices, like Replicant devices, don't have signed firmware; but that was in a much earlier time.
21:52:05 <TheJollyRoger> But in the case of most phones running Replicant, some of them can't use their radios -- or need to plug in external ones -- because the firmware for them isn't free either.
21:52:12 <jonmonty[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Welcome to what's beneath the fi"> If Graphene made its own hardware could if be 100% free?
21:52:44 <jonmonty[m]> *it
21:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> jonmonty[m]: If we started at the level of "go to the beach, scoop up a bucket of sand, and start from there", possibly, but that'd be a huge amount of money.
21:54:36 <TheJollyRoger> Let me put it this way: even my Talos II which I can modify the self-boot engine for (the very first instruction that runs during power-on)
21:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> And re-fuse the FPGA used for power sequencing?
21:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> And that came with several *thousand* pages of documentation detailing exactly how the board works, and the Power ISA reference manual?
21:55:39 <TheJollyRoger> I certainly didn't delid the chips, take them apart layer by layer, and go over them with an electron microscope.
21:56:54 <TheJollyRoger> https://raptorcs.com/content/base/products.html
22:06:47 <strcat> jonmonty[m]: there's no such thing as an open ARM SoC and the same applies to other components used in smartphones in practice
22:06:52 <strcat> jonmonty[m]: fully closed hardware and firmware
22:07:06 <strcat> is presented as 'open' based on shipping with an open source OS on top of entirely closed source components
22:07:09 <strcat> but it isn't open
22:07:14 <strcat> it's just presented that way
22:07:27 <strcat> and in fact in the case of Purism they substantially lock down the devices and prevent users from upgrading it
22:07:30 <strcat> along with obfuscating it
22:07:40 <strcat> making it harder to inspect and preventing securing it
22:07:49 <strcat> a lot of what they do is pretty much sabotage of security
22:08:03 <strcat> it's directly counter to what we want
22:08:53 <strcat> anyway it's off-topic for this channel
22:09:05 <strcat> and people need to read the information on the site first
22:11:26 <rny> maybe with risc-v you can have open hardware
22:11:49 <rny> but porting android to risc-v, i doubt it'll happen anytime soon
22:11:51 <strcat> RISC-V is an open source ISA (as a base)
22:12:08 <TheJollyRoger> But as for the chips, they're only ever going to be as open as the vendors allow, right?
22:12:16 <strcat> it's permissively licensed and most hardware for it that's on the scale of a smartphone SoC will likely be closed source
22:12:24 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: yes, most RISC-V hardware will be closed source
22:12:28 <strcat> entirely, or mostly
22:12:32 <rny> not sure if any soc designers are happy to give away ip for free
22:12:34 <rny> kek
22:12:43 <rny> it is their livelihoods after all
22:12:44 <strcat> the only part that's open is the ISA unless vendors choose to open source their hardware
22:13:00 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense. I think the biggest deployment of RISC-V is in NVIDIA Graphics cards to replace the old era Falcon processor, so they don't need to keep paying royalties for the Falcon chip.
22:13:11 <strcat> RISC-V isn't 'open hardware' itself but rather 'open API for software to talk to hardware'
22:13:29 <strcat> with ARM, you can't make open hardware
22:13:44 <strcat> with RISC-V, you could, but it doesn't mean it will be common or that high-end chips usable for a smartphone are likely to exist any time soon
22:14:15 <strcat> also even if the whole SoC design is open
22:14:22 <strcat> that doesn't imply that the end result of what's produced is open
22:14:43 <strcat> do you think the manufacturing process is going to be open? that's a whole separate thing
22:14:49 <rny> strcat: do you know much about the upcoming risc-v board -- sifive?
22:17:53 * banjo[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ccCRssWEmuRgptiQbFCRpTuH/message.txt >
22:18:22 <charuto> in a few decades you'll be able to print your own smartphone at home
22:18:38 <strcat> I mean a company like TSMC has a closed source manufacturing process and you can't simply replicate what they do
22:18:41 <strcat> you give them your SoC design
22:18:44 <strcat> they produce it
22:18:48 <strcat> you don't have the technology to do it
22:19:24 * banjo[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YSyTcAfAzpPBlzxihAilrpdt/message.txt >
22:19:26 <strcat> even with a fully open source SoC design - which is not really a thing right now - it doesn't mean that the end result is open, because the technology to go from that to what was produced is closed source
22:20:21 <strcat> and RISC-V certainly does not mean an open SoC, or even an open source CPU core design (which is just one part of an SoC)
22:20:30 <strcat> is the memory controller open source? there are a ton of other components on there
22:20:47 <strcat> RISC-V is just an ISA - the API software uses to talk to the hardware
22:21:02 <strcat> RISC-V is not an open source CPU / SoC, that's not what it is, you can make one with it
22:21:09 <strcat> you can also make a closed source one
22:21:22 <strcat> or a mix
22:21:36 <strcat> can use an open source CPU core, and closed source components for other things
22:21:45 <rny> it is an incremental step towards an open platform?
22:21:48 <strcat> and the manufacturing process, etc. is pretty likely to all be proprietary secrets
22:21:52 <strcat> rny: yes
22:22:12 <strcat> rny: and an incremental step to more closed platforms? *shrug*
22:22:30 <rny> cant be more closed than x86 can it?
22:22:34 <rny> kek
22:22:34 <strcat> rny: it's permissively licensed, it fully permits doing entirely closed source stuff based on it
22:22:37 <strcat> other than the ISA
22:23:00 <strcat> the ISA being open or closed is basically about whether someone can make a compatible CPU
22:23:05 <strcat> RISC-V makes that part open
22:23:14 <strcat> anyone can make a RISC-V CPU, closed or open, without approval/permission
22:23:16 <strcat> that's the point of it
22:23:25 <strcat> it doesn't make anything else open - although it *enables* doing it
22:23:52 <strcat> and, as always, open does not mean private or secure, it doesn't improve those things in any direct way
22:24:18 <strcat> it enables a company to make an SoC focused on those things that's compatible with the rest of the ecosystem - to some extent (there are all kinds of extensions, etc.)
22:25:57 <rny> x
22:26:04 <rny> s/x/ok/
22:26:59 <rny> i think most people, including myself are just extrapolating what could happen under risc-v's royalty-free and permissive model
22:27:39 <rny> i.e. the potential to develop more open hardware which (hopefully) attracts more voluntary security audits by the open-source community
22:27:42 <strcat> I think a lot of people are wrongly thinking a RISC-V CPU is an open source CPU when that's usually not the case
22:27:51 <strcat> not you, but others
22:28:12 <rny> i'm perfectly aware that there's no way that foundry manufacturing can ever be open
22:28:13 <strcat> I mean, the open source community is hardly doing any security work
22:28:15 <strcat> or audits
22:28:17 <strcat> that's not really a thing
22:28:19 <strcat> it's imagined
22:28:23 <rny> unless everyone happens to have a billion dollars in their pocket :/
22:28:31 <strcat> and especially for something really complex and requiring a lot of knowledge it's unrealistic
22:29:53 <rny> strcat: you dont think that projects that are open source (such as android) yield better security outcomes when compared to closed-sourced ios? undiscovered 0-days in android seems to be detected sooner and also patched sooner versus undiscovered/exploited 0-days in ios?
22:30:41 <strcat> a project being open source doesn't imply it gets any of the attention that android does
22:30:50 <strcat> and android being open source is not necessarily why that's the case
22:31:48 <strcat> and no I don't think it has been shown to yield better results
22:32:27 <theOne[m]> Well now i know exactly whats in my phone
22:32:50 <theOne[m]> And the  disclaimer on all the software licences
22:33:06 <theOne[m]> Says its the NSA
22:33:38 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
22:33:40 <TheJollyRoger> *gulp*
22:33:42 <TheJollyRoger> *gulp*
22:33:44 <TheJollyRoger> *gulp*
22:33:58 <theOne[m]> The entire list of every file in my fone
22:34:02 <theOne[m]> They inserted
22:34:04 <theOne[m]> Is all here
22:34:20 <strcat> theOne[m]: if you're going to make extraordinary claims like this repeatedly
22:34:26 <strcat> start showing some actual evidence for it please
22:34:30 <theOne[m]> Jesus
22:34:36 <theOne[m]> Just ask
22:34:55 <rny> ask who? Jesus?
22:35:04 <rny> i dont have a hotline to Jesus
22:35:10 <theOne[m]> I dont really give a rats ass about the NSA i dont know how i copped this for so long
22:35:16 <theOne[m]> I took a screen recording
22:35:22 <theOne[m]> You can go thru it yourself
22:35:29 <strcat> a screen recording?
22:35:40 <theOne[m]> Its on my damn phone
22:35:45 <strcat> what is?
22:35:50 * rny smells a troll
22:36:09 <strcat> a screen recording of what?
22:36:14 <theOne[m]> No im not trollong
22:36:38 <theOne[m]> Ive spoken to daniel over email a little
22:37:07 <theOne[m]> And he was a little confused about the url fragments showing in my browser
22:37:31 <theOne[m]> And trying to explain how much trouble this has been for me just gets too much i dunno where to begin
22:37:41 <strcat> so explain something
22:37:52 <strcat> you just raise something you think is concerning with vague details
22:37:58 <theOne[m]> So i dunno when or where
22:38:25 <theOne[m]> Nah because the last time i tried to talk
22:38:29 <strcat> usually don't really finish talking about something, just mention something, start a vague explanation, and it's not finished
22:38:32 <theOne[m]> It was everyone trolling me
22:38:50 <strcat> signal:noise ratio is really low
22:39:02 <theOne[m]> Ill give you credit that you answer the questions
22:39:11 <strcat> you're saying you think you're compromised with no details on why
22:39:15 <strcat> as before
22:39:47 <theOne[m]> Its because I don't even know to what extent
22:39:55 <theOne[m]> But now i have it here in front of me
22:40:01 <theOne[m]> Under the settings
22:40:05 <theOne[m]> Touch about phone
22:40:26 <theOne[m]> Then i touch legal information
22:40:32 <theOne[m]> And third party licences
22:41:10 <theOne[m]> And a list of certain files in ny system folder show there
22:41:44 <theOne[m]> I accidentally zoomed out when i ran my fingers over while distracted
22:41:51 <theOne[m]> And it zoomed out the entire list
22:42:00 <joltman[m]> files unique to you or system files?
22:42:13 <strcat[m]> that's a normal UI
22:42:20 <strcat[m]> the build collects all the licenses and puts them in a big list
22:42:25 <theOne[m]> Of all the script files and everything that's not graphene
22:42:28 <strcat[m]> to comply with attribution requirements
22:42:34 <strcat[m]> that's part of the OS
22:42:42 <theOne[m]> Cos the ones not grapheneos
22:42:44 <strcat[m]> it's the same for every install
22:42:47 <theOne[m]> Are highlighted
22:43:32 <theOne[m]> You see
22:43:33 <theOne[m]> You start explaining before i finish
22:43:33 <strcat[m]> I don't understand why you're worried about the software licenses list
22:43:43 <theOne[m]> Nevermind
22:43:52 <theOne[m]> Im just trolling
22:44:15 <strcat[m]> ????
22:46:00 <rny> can we ban the user?
22:46:12 <fomijafi[m]> Just finish your explanation.
22:46:24 <joltman[m]> one more reason we can't have nice things
22:46:56 <sierocharlie[m]> What a morron.
23:39:00 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah. Uh... sorry, I missed the conversation from earlier. strcat[m]: the SiFive's memory controller is not open, it is proprietary.
23:41:47 <TheJollyRoger> I was excited too until I found that out.
23:43:16 <strcat[m]> just one example
23:43:59 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, ah, sorry.
23:47:33 <louipc> oh dang lol is there an open one
23:47:42 <louipc> wait why we talkin bout this here
23:56:12 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, my bad!
