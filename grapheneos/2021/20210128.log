00:00:17 <noobexterminator> Im trying to install graphene
00:00:42 <strcat[m]> follow the official guide at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli then
00:00:44 <strcat[m]> don't do whatever it is you're doing with Windows Explorer
00:01:30 <noobexterminator> But when i hold the Power and Volume key and it redirects me to the Bootloader unlock section it just exits me out and goes to the Google power on
00:01:30 <strcat[m]> the web installer may be ready later today for initial use with current gen devices
00:01:53 <strcat[m]> you're releasing volume before power
00:02:07 <strcat[m]> you can also just hold volume down and plug in the cable
00:02:18 <strcat[m]> you don't have to press power, you just have to power it on while holding volume down
00:02:27 <noobexterminator> Ohhh
00:02:29 <noobexterminator> Ok
00:02:32 <noobexterminator> Thanks dude
00:02:34 <strcat[m]> if you continue holding the power button and release volume down you're forcing it off again
00:02:36 <noobexterminator> I will try rn
00:03:54 <illustratorius[m> Bit of advice for those of us new to Graphene OS. Make sure you relock your bootloader BEFORE using the phone. I relocked and it wiped everything.
00:03:54 <illustratorius[m> Whoops.
00:04:03 <noobexterminator> BROOO
00:04:05 <noobexterminator> THANKS
00:04:15 <void9> I just tried to install. after flashing my pixel 4a, the phone screen went black, and the cmd pompt says <waiting for any device>

00:05:03 <noobexterminator> strcat
00:05:11 <noobexterminator> THANKS
00:05:52 <strcat[m]> void9: not supposed to use command prompt, follow https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
00:06:26 <strcat[m]> illustratorius: yeah, it has to do that since the data from before locking is untrusted
00:06:44 <void9> i used powershell
00:06:57 <strcat[m]> illustratorius: we explain that at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#locking-the-bootloader
00:07:15 <strcat[m]> and https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#flashing-factory-images mentions that it's important to lock right away
00:07:29 <strcat[m]> it's also the only way of knowing that the installation worked properly and it's not corrupted
00:09:44 <strcat[m]> void9: make sure you're in the bootloader menu on the phone
00:10:20 <void9> i cant get the phone to respond anymore
00:12:08 <noobexterminator> Yo
00:12:08 <noobexterminator> I used command prompt

00:12:17 <noobexterminator> Flash-all isnt working dude

00:13:59 <noobexterminator> I already have the bootloader unlocked i already pasted the files into the Platform tools folder
00:14:24 <noobexterminator> And when i click on flash-all it shows a bunch of red text for 1 milisecond then it exits out
00:14:45 <noobexterminator> Idk if its my usb cable
00:14:53 <noobexterminator> Im going to go change it
00:15:35 <noobexterminator> Dosent work still

00:18:25 <void9> soooo, is there a way to fix it, or is it just a paperweight now?
00:23:25 <TheJollyRoger> void9: Did you attempt to flash a 4a (Sunfish) image on a 4a5G?
00:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> I really don't like to be the bearer of bad news but... if you attempted that kind of a stunt, go and start seeing if you can get a Return Merchandise Authorization, that phone is toast.
00:24:06 <void9> it is a 4a 5g
00:24:10 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
00:24:14 <TheJollyRoger> I'm... I'm sorry.
00:24:34 <TheJollyRoger> But the 4a5G for some reason doesn't have the bootloader signature check.
00:24:39 <TheJollyRoger> It's a--
00:24:42 <TheJollyRoger> Oh shoot hang on everyone!
00:25:23 <noobexterminator> AHHHHH
00:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> void9: I'm sorry but... attempting to flash a Sunfish (4a) image onto a 4a5G will permanently hardbrick the phone.
00:26:57 <zknshfr[m]> Is the network cut 100% of the time when you turn the permission off, from boot time?
00:27:03 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a5G might look like a 4a. It might have the same outside, but... the chip underneath is very different. It requires a different kernel, different drivers, different everything, and different bootloader image.
00:27:45 <void9> if i take it somewhere, can they fix it?
00:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> zknshfr[m]: As far as I know yes.
00:27:50 <TheJollyRoger> void9: I don't know.
00:28:38 <TheJollyRoger> I think the best thing you can do now is attempt to see if you can report your device as having been dead on arrival and return it for a refund. Your credit card company may have an "extended warranty" period, so check with them.
00:29:23 <void9> Ok, thanks
00:29:28 <noobexterminator> <TheJollyRoger "The 4a5G might look like a 4a. I"> Yo i need mega help
00:29:34 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: yes?
00:29:43 <noobexterminator> <TheJollyRoger "noobexterminator3000: yes?"> read the old chats

00:30:09 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: you need to follow the directions. You aren't supposed to click flash-al.l bat, it doesn't work that way.
00:30:30 <TheJollyRoger> It needs to be run via powershell, the way the directions explain.

00:31:12 <noobexterminator> Im right here dude can i still follow the directions
00:31:16 <noobexterminator> Or am i screwed
00:31:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on noobexterminator you're not screwed. If you still see fastboot come up, the phone's fine.
00:32:18 <TheJollyRoger> I'm available to do a talk-down for you, but I only do talk-downs on the condition that you follow my directions exactly and don't attemp to ad-lib, do things your own way, or add an extra step.
00:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> Because remember, I can't see your screen, nor am I standing beside you to watch your workflow.
00:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> So I'm flying blind.
00:33:04 <TheJollyRoger> So if you deviate from the instructions, you screw up the entire workflow and likely it won't work.
00:33:21 <TheJollyRoger> If you get ahead of me, then I can't help you.
00:33:46 <noobexterminator> ok dude im in the opening terminal section in grapheneOS's page
00:33:59 <noobexterminator> I have my usb plugged in my pixel 3a
00:34:08 <noobexterminator> And ny phones on the fastboot mode
00:34:13 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I can talk you through the instructions. First, we're going to do a small sanity check.
00:34:20 <TheJollyRoger> You're running Windows 10, correct?
00:34:25 <noobexterminator> Yes
00:34:37 <noobexterminator> My schools laptop
00:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> Your device is a 4a Sunfish, NOT a 4a5G, or any other device?
00:34:58 <noobexterminator> No its a pixel 3a
00:35:07 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great.
00:35:31 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, so you've unlocked so far, but first, we're going to do some quick sanity checks:
00:35:39 <noobexterminator> ok
00:35:40 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to open up Powershell.
00:35:54 <noobexterminator> Non admin or admin
00:36:01 <TheJollyRoger> Non-admin. Once you do, can you confirm you see "PS C:\Users\[yourname\>"? The "PS" is important.
00:36:20 <noobexterminator> How do i run non admin
00:36:27 <noobexterminator> Is it by default non admin
00:36:46 <noobexterminator> Yes i see PS
00:36:47 <TheJollyRoger> Do you see "Administrator: Powershell" in the top-left corner, where the window title should be?
00:37:11 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: 20210127_183653_8837054291034221479.jpg (60KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tiNYHkNYcMWOtfgWPURIVjha/20210127_183653_8837054291034221479.jpg >
00:37:20 <noobexterminator> It says Windows Powershell
00:37:47 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great, you got it.
00:38:18 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, first sanity check, I want to check if you've got any third-party versions of fastboot installed to the computer to make sure we don't end up causing a conflict which could brick your device.
00:38:39 <noobexterminator> How do i check that
00:38:47 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to enter in the following command, and if it produces a red text error that says something like your command is not recognized, that's a good sign.
00:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
00:38:55 <TheJollyRoger> Enter that, and press return.
00:39:27 <noobexterminator> It says not recognized
00:39:31 <noobexterminator> Do i exit
00:39:33 <TheJollyRoger> If it gives you a red text error and says "The term fastboot is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, etc etc etc, that's a GOOD sign.
00:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> No. Don't do anything until I tell you to.
00:39:45 <noobexterminator> YESIR
00:39:49 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, if you get ahead of me, this throws off the workflow entirely.
00:39:53 <TheJollyRoger> Because I'm not sitting next to you.
00:40:03 <noobexterminator> Ok
00:40:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm flying /blind/.
00:40:22 <TheJollyRoger> So. If you get ahead of me, I won't know what's happened and likely will tell you the wrong instructions because of that.
00:40:32 <noobexterminator> Ok
00:40:47 <noobexterminator> Ill follow youre instructions step by step
00:40:50 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. The second thing you're going to need to do - do you have Windows automatic updates on?
00:41:09 <TheJollyRoger> Do you have any optional updates?
00:41:26 <TheJollyRoger> Open up the Windows Update settings, and keep that window in the background.
00:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> You may need it later.
00:41:31 <noobexterminator> It says pending updates
00:41:54 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: 20210127_184139_7411045401767620709.jpg (81KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bqHvQAWRhBjqNmiuyrMmiCsG/20210127_184139_7411045401767620709.jpg >
00:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> We may need to use this later.
00:42:27 <fred`> It would be nice to able to select which biometric-auth-entry (multiple fingerprints added) exactly is allowed to 'unlock phone' or 'in-app-biometric-auth'
00:43:12 <noobexterminator> Also do i close the Powershell i just opened
00:43:23 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: not until the installation is done, we're going to need it.
00:43:32 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to set the alias for curl with this command:
00:43:37 <TheJollyRoger> remove-item alias:curl
00:43:39 <noobexterminator> The one you told me to type fastboot --version
00:43:41 <noobexterminator> Ok
00:43:55 <TheJollyRoger> Don't close it until after GrapheneOS is installed or you're going to mess up the entire process.
00:44:05 <noobexterminator> Do i just type it in the powershell
00:44:06 <TheJollyRoger> This command will produce no output.
00:44:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, type it into powershell and press return. It will produce no output and simply give you another line.
00:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> But it allows us to do the next step. We're going to test if you did it right.
00:44:44 <noobexterminator> ok it gave me another line
00:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> Step two, we're going to test curl. I want you to type into powershell:
00:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> curl --version
00:45:00 <TheJollyRoger> and press return.
00:45:12 <TheJollyRoger> It should say something like "Curl 7.55.1 (Windows) and some other gibberish.
00:45:25 <TheJollyRoger> Can you confirm it says something like that?
00:45:30 <noobexterminator> Yeah it says that
00:45:34 <noobexterminator> 7.55.1
00:45:44 <TheJollyRoger> Great. We're going to get you the correct Fastboot now. Step three:
00:46:04 <TheJollyRoger> type in this command into Powershell:
00:46:07 <TheJollyRoger> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
00:46:10 <TheJollyRoger> And press return.
00:46:13 <TheJollyRoger> Wait for it to finish.
00:46:51 <noobexterminator> Whats the website for
00:47:15 <TheJollyRoger> That's where the official platform-tools is located. You do not need to visit it in a browser, just enter that command.
00:47:17 <noobexterminator> It says no url soecified
00:47:29 <noobexterminator> Ok wait let me type the command
00:47:41 <TheJollyRoger> You must enter the command *exactly* or it will error out.
00:47:56 <TheJollyRoger> Note that the -O is a capital O, not a 0.
00:48:00 <TheJollyRoger> It is case sensitive.
00:48:06 <noobexterminator> Ok
00:48:10 <noobexterminator> In typing ok
00:48:14 <noobexterminator> *im*
00:49:18 <noobexterminator> Okay im done typing the command
00:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hit return. This can take a while depending on how fast your connection is. Curl will reach out and download the files to your computer.
00:49:48 <noobexterminator> Where do i press return
00:49:50 <TheJollyRoger> we are doing this through curl because this way, I'll know exactly where it will save the files to and I can properly path it.
00:49:58 <TheJollyRoger> This should all be done in PowerShell.
00:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> Do NOT use a web browser.
00:50:13 <TheJollyRoger> All of this is done in PowerShell.
00:50:18 <noobexterminator> Im using powershell
00:50:27 <noobexterminator> I already entered the commabd
00:50:37 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Hit return and let it download.
00:50:45 <noobexterminator> Its done
00:51:07 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. We're going to verify it now. Step Four, in Powershell, enter the command:
00:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> (Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip).hash -eq "549ba2bdc31f335eb8a504f005f77606a479cc216d6b64a3e8b64c780003661f"
00:51:21 <TheJollyRoger> And hit return.
00:51:31 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know what it says.
00:52:01 <noobexterminator> uhh wait
00:52:01 <TheJollyRoger> It should say "True."
00:52:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yes?
00:52:11 <noobexterminator> Im going to go to element on pc to copy and paste it
00:52:16 <TheJollyRoger> Okay.
00:52:34 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just going to pour some tea while you go and log in.
00:52:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ping me when you're ready by typing in "TheJollyRoger" to continue.
00:53:02 <TheJollyRoger> (by typing in "TheJollyRoger" into Element, I mean)
00:53:26 <noobexterminator> I forgot my password
00:53:32 <noobexterminator> Wait let me remember
00:55:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, waiting.
00:55:48 <noobexterminator> I FORGOT MY PASSWORD
00:56:04 * TheJollyRoger starts playing a tune on the Harpsichord as his idle animation.
00:56:07 <noobexterminator> <TheJollyRoger "Yep, waiting."> yo
00:56:10 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, sheesh.
00:56:14 <TheJollyRoger> You found it?
00:56:21 <noobexterminator> No
00:56:29 <noobexterminator> Im going to join in a different account
00:56:51 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
00:56:58 <noobexterminator> Ill be bacj in 30 seca
00:57:02 <noobexterminator> Seconds
00:57:12 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. You may need to log out to prevent your old inactive account from becoming a zombie.
00:57:28 <TheJollyRoger> Or you might be able to add your e-mail address and reset the password.
00:58:08 <yoitsmeextermina> yooo
00:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
00:58:11 <yoitsmeextermina> wadupp
00:58:13 <TheJollyRoger> Fixed?
00:58:22 <yoitsmeextermina> yes
00:58:24 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
00:58:36 <yoitsmeextermina> ok im going topaste the command
00:58:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ok!
00:59:02 <yoitsmeextermina> it says True
00:59:06 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
00:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> If it says "True" then we know that the hash is valid. So next step, Step Five, we're going to unpack it.
00:59:31 <yoitsmeextermina> okay
00:59:32 <TheJollyRoger> So in Powershell, I want you to type:
00:59:36 <TheJollyRoger> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
00:59:52 <TheJollyRoger> And hit return - it's going to spew out a *lot* of text, but as long as it's not an error message, you should be OK.
01:00:03 <yoitsmeextermina> its going
01:00:11 <yoitsmeextermina> like a bunch of text
01:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. This can take some time depending on how fast your computer is.
01:00:23 <TheJollyRoger> Since it has to decompress all those files.
01:00:33 <yoitsmeextermina> done
01:00:46 <yoitsmeextermina> wait dude
01:00:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yep?
01:01:02 <yoitsmeextermina> i already have SDK tools installed and i unzipped them along time ago
01:01:27 <yoitsmeextermina> and i also have another folder with the Pixel 3a stable version sargo-factory
01:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> Even if you do, the thing is, I can't know for certain if you downloaded the right version, have it up to date, and also, where it is.
01:01:42 <TheJollyRoger> So it's actually paradoxically faster for me to walk you through from the beginning.
01:01:47 <TheJollyRoger> Even if it's not as efficient.
01:01:48 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:01:53 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:01:56 <yoitsmeextermina> yes
01:02:28 <TheJollyRoger> So step six, we need to set the command pathing properly - at this point, DO NOT CLOSE the Powershell window! If you do we'll lose the command pathing and you'll have to redo step six.
01:02:53 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:03:12 <TheJollyRoger> So the next command, Step Six:
01:03:16 <TheJollyRoger> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
01:03:19 <TheJollyRoger> And hit return.
01:03:32 <TheJollyRoger> This should return you to a blank line.
01:03:33 <yoitsmeextermina> it gave me another line
01:03:39 <yoitsmeextermina> it did
01:03:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! Now we're going to see if it worked, I want you to test...
01:03:50 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
01:03:52 <TheJollyRoger> and hit return.
01:04:04 <TheJollyRoger> It may say something like Fastboot version 30.0.5 installed under...
01:04:14 <yoitsmeextermina> Installed as C:\Users\eb0303076\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
01:04:21 <yoitsmeextermina> it gave me that
01:04:25 <TheJollyRoger> The important thing is that it says version 30.0.5 - does it say that?
01:04:29 <TheJollyRoger> or version 30?
01:04:40 <yoitsmeextermina> my bad and yes it did give me fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
01:04:46 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:04:51 <yoitsmeextermina> Good
01:04:53 <TheJollyRoger> We're heading in the right direction.
01:04:59 <yoitsmeextermina> yessir
01:05:20 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Your phone's already unlocked, so for this, we're going to skip the unlocking.
01:05:33 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to get you the archive.
01:05:38 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> You said you're using a 3a, not a 3aXL, just a regular 3a?
01:06:00 <yoitsmeextermina> regular 3a
01:06:19 <TheJollyRoger> Alrighty. We're going to retrieve the archive with Step Seven:
01:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2021.01.23.03.zip
01:06:41 <TheJollyRoger> Enter the command into PowerShell and hit return.
01:07:12 <yoitsmeextermina> its downloading
01:07:13 <TheJollyRoger> This is going to download the entire image. It's fairly large at 1.2GB so it can take a while depending on how fast your connection is.
01:07:27 <yoitsmeextermina> is it the stable version
01:07:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, this is the stable version.
01:08:06 <yoitsmeextermina> i believe you dude
01:08:14 <TheJollyRoger> Just to make sure, we can check after the install.
01:08:30 <yoitsmeextermina> its done
01:08:34 <yoitsmeextermina> it gave me a blank line
01:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:08:58 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, now here we're going to unpack the archive...
01:09:03 <TheJollyRoger> Step Eight:
01:09:09 <TheJollyRoger> tar xvf sunfish-factory-2021.01.23.03.zip
01:09:12 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops
01:09:14 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry,
01:09:16 <TheJollyRoger> Ignore that last one.
01:09:21 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:09:45 <TheJollyRoger> tar xvf sargo-factory-2021.01.23.03.zip
01:10:00 <TheJollyRoger> It should give you a blank line but it should change your prompt window to say "sargo-factory -something-something"
01:10:05 <TheJollyRoger> Er,
01:10:10 <TheJollyRoger> sorry, it should unpack the files, d'oh.
01:10:12 <TheJollyRoger> I'm getting ahead of myself.
01:10:18 <yoitsmeextermina> do i copy and paste that
01:10:24 <yoitsmeextermina> tar xvf sargo-factory-2021.01.23.03.zip
01:10:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, copy and paste it into Powershell and hit return.
01:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> It should unpack the archive.
01:10:48 <TheJollyRoger> Wait until it's done, it's a fairly big one.
01:10:56 <yoitsmeextermina> its done
01:11:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, next we're going to move into the directory:
01:11:05 <TheJollyRoger> Step nine:
01:11:15 <TheJollyRoger> cd sargo-factory-2021.01.23.03
01:11:23 <TheJollyRoger> Copy and paste that into powershell, and press return.
01:11:35 <TheJollyRoger> Now, there's one last step we're going to need to do before we begin the process.
01:12:00 <yoitsmeextermina> wait
01:12:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yep?
01:12:23 <yoitsmeextermina> im stuck
01:12:25 <yoitsmeextermina> here
01:12:26 <yoitsmeextermina> PS C:\Users\eb0303076\sargo-factory-2021.01.23.03>
01:12:34 <TheJollyRoger> Let's see... yep, that's good!
01:12:41 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:12:49 <TheJollyRoger> You got it. Now, there's one last little thing we should do.
01:13:17 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone is on that screen, and it's plugged into the computer -- are you on a desktop, or a laptop?
01:13:35 <yoitsmeextermina> laptop that you can carry around
01:13:46 <yoitsmeextermina> my phone scren is in the fastboot mode and plugged in my computer
01:14:07 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Lay the phone screen-side-up flat on your desk. Double-check all those cables, make sure they're in nice and snugly.
01:14:27 <TheJollyRoger> We have one last sanity check to do to make sure your fastboot on your computer can talk to your phone.
01:14:41 <yoitsmeextermina> ok the cable is plugged in good
01:14:45 <TheJollyRoger> Once we start the process though, we must *not* disturb the phone until Fastboot tells us: "Finished, press any key to continue."
01:15:00 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone will flash strange things and go to a menu that's called "fastbootd" at one point.
01:15:11 <yoitsmeextermina> okay
01:15:22 <TheJollyRoger> But we *must* not disturb the phone until fastboot tells us it's finished, or fastboot hangs before it starts the process.
01:15:27 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, it could corrupt the installation.
01:15:36 <TheJollyRoger> So make sure that phone is located where it won't fall or won't get snagged.
01:15:51 <TheJollyRoger> And we must not navigate any of the buttons until the phone is done.
01:16:10 <TheJollyRoger> So, with that in mind, let's see if fastboot can talk to the phone. Step ten:
01:16:13 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --devices
01:16:29 <yoitsmeextermina> its good
01:16:29 <yoitsmeextermina> in a safe place
01:16:40 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Enter that command into powershell and hit return. If it's working, it will return your phone's Serial Number onto the screen of your PC.
01:16:52 <TheJollyRoger> Then it will give you a blank line.
01:17:05 <yoitsmeextermina> C:\Users\eb0303076\platform-tools\fastboot.exe: unknown option -- devices
01:17:10 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, sorry.
01:17:11 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot devices
01:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, my bad, that was my fault.
01:17:23 <TheJollyRoger> It's "fastboot devices"
01:17:27 <TheJollyRoger> No dashes.
01:17:37 <yoitsmeextermina> it gave me some numbers
01:17:45 <TheJollyRoger> Great. We're on the home stretch now.
01:17:48 <yoitsmeextermina> and fastboot next to it
01:17:52 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
01:18:02 <TheJollyRoger> Take a deep breath, and step twelve:
01:18:03 <yoitsmeextermina> YES
01:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> ./flash-all.sh
01:18:12 <TheJollyRoger> Enter that and hit return.
01:18:15 <TheJollyRoger> Ah
01:18:16 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> FUck
01:18:19 <TheJollyRoger> srory,
01:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> abort
01:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> ./flash-all.bat
01:18:24 <yoitsmeextermina> Nooo what
01:18:29 <yoitsmeextermina> ok
01:18:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's ./flash-all.bat
01:18:52 <TheJollyRoger> This can take a while depending on how fast your USB is.
01:18:56 <TheJollyRoger> *your USB interface is.
01:19:15 <noobexterminator> Yo
01:19:18 <noobexterminator> My phones going crazy
01:19:50 <TheJollyRoger> What does Fastboot say?

01:20:18 <noobexterminator> Its just running lines
01:20:20 <noobexterminator> <TheJollyRoger "What does Fastboot say?"> Idk
01:20:30 <TheJollyRoger> Leave it be. Don't touch the phone.

01:20:50 <noobexterminator> Ok
01:21:14 <TheJollyRoger> The first thing it's going to do is send a new bootloader to the phone.
01:21:16 <TheJollyRoger> It's working.
01:21:24 <TheJollyRoger> It's writing the system partition.
01:21:28 <noobexterminator> Okay dude
01:21:35 <noobexterminator> It says press any key to exit
01:21:41 <noobexterminator> What do i press
01:21:47 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, Don't unplug your phone. On the keyboard of your computer hit return.
01:22:05 <noobexterminator> U dont have the return key
01:22:08 <noobexterminator> I
01:22:16 <TheJollyRoger> Does it say "press any key to continue?"
01:22:21 <noobexterminator> I have backspace
01:22:23 <noobexterminator> Tes
01:22:26 <noobexterminator> Yes
01:22:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Hit a key. Does it return you to the prompt?
01:22:52 <noobexterminator> Im going to press E
01:23:05 <noobexterminator> Ok i did it
01:23:14 <noobexterminator> It gave me a blank line
01:23:15 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, don't close the window yet and don't unplug your phone just yet... we will need it.
01:23:26 <noobexterminator> Ok
01:23:26 <TheJollyRoger> Look at your phone. Is it back on fastboot, or fastbootd?
01:23:39 <noobexterminator> Fastboot mode

01:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, I want you to look at the volume keys. Press up or down until it says something like start or power on.
01:24:32 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Can you just tap the power key once and let it go?
01:24:44 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: 20210127_192426_6189752434840990990.jpg (62KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/beaCYJNiWXmPUFkoxxhgNaaA/20210127_192426_6189752434840990990.jpg >
01:24:48 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to do a test boot of the operating system *just once* to see if she boots.
01:25:02 <noobexterminator> Ok im going to press the power button
01:25:12 <TheJollyRoger> Just tap and release, don't hold it or it will switch the phone off.
01:25:13 <noobexterminator> It says start ok
01:25:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
01:25:35 <TheJollyRoger> We're just going to test boot the phone *before* we finalize the installation.
01:25:39 <TheJollyRoger> Just to make sure it boots.
01:25:44 <noobexterminator> YOOO
01:25:52 <TheJollyRoger> It boots? :)

01:26:07 <noobexterminator> GrepeneOs
01:26:17 <TheJollyRoger> Don't unplug it yet, we have to finish the installation... but we're almost there.

01:26:41 <noobexterminator> Ok
01:27:00 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I want you to (without unplugging your phone) switch it off by using the power button.
01:27:13 <noobexterminator> How
01:27:19 <noobexterminator> Do i hold it
01:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> Press and hold the power button for a second, let it go, it and the power options should appear.
01:27:38 <TheJollyRoger> You should see a "Power Off" key appear on screen.
01:27:53 <noobexterminator> It shut off
01:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Ok, now I want to reenter Fastboot mode - hold down the "Volume Down" key and squeeze the power button and hold them both down until Fastboot appears.
01:28:24 <noobexterminator> Wait
01:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
01:28:44 <noobexterminator> My phone went to the Unlocjed booterthing and now its off
01:28:50 <noobexterminator> Now its charging
01:29:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, whoops, you let go of the key at the wrong moment. If you have trouble with the combo keys we can reboot it to the bootloader using adb, but can you get it back to fastboot?
01:29:59 <noobexterminator> Its just charging
01:30:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Can you hold down the volume down key, then hold down the power key, then keep them held down together until the phone starts, then release them simultaneously?
01:30:53 <TheJollyRoger> So long as the operating system isn't running this should get us back to fastboot.
01:30:57 <noobexterminator> Yes ok
01:31:10 <noobexterminator> Wait
01:31:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
01:31:17 <noobexterminator> On what screen do i realse the keys
01:31:25 <TheJollyRoger> Once it says "Fastboot mode."
01:31:30 <noobexterminator> On the grapheneOs screen or the google screen
01:31:44 <TheJollyRoger> If it boots to the GrapheneOS screen, we'll do this through adb.
01:31:52 <noobexterminator> Ok im here
01:31:55 <noobexterminator> Let me send pic
01:31:58 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.

01:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> Great. I want you to type into powershell:
01:32:36 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot flashing lock
01:32:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hit return and then look at your phone.
01:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> It will ask you if you want to lock bootloader.
01:33:00 <TheJollyRoger> Here you're going to want to confirm you want to lock the bootloader.
01:33:06 <noobexterminator> Do i lock the bootloader
01:33:08 <TheJollyRoger> This can't be done through your computer, it must be done using the volume keys.
01:33:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you will want to lock the bootloader at this point.
01:33:20 <noobexterminator> Ok

01:34:05 <noobexterminator> Its locked now
01:34:16 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Can you see the green text that says "Locked" under bootloader?

01:34:27 <noobexterminator> Yes
01:35:20 <noobexterminator> What do i do now
01:35:23 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Unplug your phone, and press "Start"
01:35:33 <noobexterminator> Are you sure dude
01:35:33 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome to GrapheneOS, the installation has finished.
01:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
01:35:45 <TheJollyRoger> Can you confirm that a yellow screen says,
01:35:51 <TheJollyRoger> "Your device is loading a different operating system?"
01:36:08 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: 20210127_193554_8926164792365375354.jpg (20KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cfGVeyvBcBRFNvAemHnvSDDe/20210127_193554_8926164792365375354.jpg >
01:36:21 <TheJollyRoger> If it does, and GrapheneOS boots, you can now use attestation.app to

01:37:08 <noobexterminator> Wait in setting the phone up
01:37:08 <TheJollyRoger> The first display of the "Google" logo is a part of the bootloader, it's permanently there. We can't change that, but it's just branding of the handset.
01:37:22 * noobexterminator uploaded an image: 20210127_193714_2969697514598481748.jpg (37KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nfJsYwlhKwNhVeCrUekeLJii/20210127_193714_2969697514598481748.jpg >
01:37:35 <TheJollyRoger> So about that yellow "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen... that's OKthat's normal behaviour, it means the verified boot is working, just you're not loading the Google OS.
01:38:48 <noobexterminator> YOOI
01:38:54 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: yep, you're finished. Welcome aboard the ship.
01:39:18 <void9> will there be a grapheneos for the 4a5g in the future?
01:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> If you like, for extra security, you can use https://attestation.app/tutorial with remote attestation to verify the integrity and genuineness of the installation post-install

01:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hi void9, welcome back. There may, since the developers have been testing and working on it, but I can't offer any date on when.
01:40:35 <noobexterminator> <TheJollyRoger "Hi void9, welcome back. There ma"> Thank you so much bro🙏
01:40:55 <void9> Ok, im getting my phone replaced, hopefully its too fudged up for them to know
01:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: Yarr, welcome aboard the ship!
01:41:04 <TheJollyRoger> void9: whew. Glad to hear you could get a new one!
01:41:08 <noobexterminator> Couldnt have been done without you dude👍
01:41:11 <TheJollyRoger> for now you'll have to use the factory operating system.
01:41:18 <noobexterminator> TheJollyRoger
01:41:23 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: you're very welcome! Welcome aboard the ship ^_^.
01:41:40 <TheJollyRoger> If you find GrapheneOS useful, please donate to us at https://grapheneos.org/donate <- all proceeds go directly to the developers.
01:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> The project's funded entirely by donations, they keep this ship going!
01:42:25 <noobexterminator> I will try through paypal but i got to ask my mom
01:42:26 <TheJollyRoger> Today, we set sail for secure and private Android! Yarr harr, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!
01:42:37 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
01:43:00 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: from here, the most difficult parts are finished, you'll be able to navigate the operating system using the phone.
01:43:10 <TheJollyRoger> If you want, you can now enter developer options, and switch OEM unlocking off.
01:43:20 <theychuckthisfro> I'll donate once I get some more money.
01:43:22 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, that's a really important step, you don't want someone unlocking the bootloader without your password.
01:43:34 <TheJollyRoger> theychuckthisfro: Awesome, thanks in advance!
01:43:48 <noobexterminator> Do i use a Pin or Password
01:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> We really appreciate the help, guys. ^_^.
01:44:29 <noobexterminator> Also Thanks again TheJollyRoger
01:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: you can use what you prefer. I personally like to use a password, since the XKCD wordlist approach of "correct horse battery staple" is easier for me to memorize than four numbers.
01:44:33 <noobexterminator> 🙏
01:44:37 <TheJollyRoger> Hey anytime, that's what I'm here for.
01:44:46 <TheJollyRoger> But the good news is...
01:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> Google actually took a very pragmatic approach with the security chip. GrapheneOS fully uses the Weaver API for disk encryption.
01:45:27 <noobexterminator> Ok
01:45:33 <TheJollyRoger> So even if your pin code is short (provided it's not easily guessable), the secret contained in the Titan M security chip should be able to bolster the length of a short pin.
01:45:58 <TheJollyRoger> After 140 incorrect attempts at a guess at the pin, the phone will only permit one guess at the pin code every 24 hours.
01:46:02 <noobexterminator> Ok i got a question
01:46:08 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web should now work for all supported devices
01:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> The Titan M contains its own timer that doesn't respond to the host clock, so it can enforce this timeout.
01:46:12 <strcat[m]> still experimental
01:46:19 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Yarr-harr, splice the mainbrace!
01:46:24 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: yep, what can I help you with?
01:47:02 <noobexterminator> If i take a picture does anybody know i took that picture is going to some shady google server or collected by the Nsa
01:47:30 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: only if you share it unencrypted on the Internet.
01:47:46 <noobexterminator> Hmm ok
01:47:49 <TheJollyRoger> Or if someone you share it to shares it unencrypted on the internet.
01:48:06 <noobexterminator> Im going to install my apps on GrapheneOS
01:48:23 <TheJollyRoger> Or if your apps which you grant permission to, short of an exploit, share it unencrypted on the internet.
01:48:35 <noobexterminator> Will it be safe to insert my Sim card?
01:48:45 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS does not do cloud backups - by default, what's on GrapheneOS, stays on GrapheneOS.
01:48:55 <b1101> haha
01:48:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, it's now safe to insert your SIM card.
01:49:10 <noobexterminator> Ok i will insert it in a couple while
01:49:20 <noobexterminator> BRO IM HAPPY
01:49:25 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard :)
01:49:40 <TheJollyRoger> Feel free to stay around in the channel, we enjoy having lots of people around!
01:50:16 <noobexterminator> YESSIR
01:50:27 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: Now, the hard part is... you'll need to find your apps. Your apps on GrapheneOS will not self-update by default, because we don't have Play Services.
01:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS considers a number of Play Services to be privacy-invasive and require deep integration into the operating sysetm, so as a result we don't include them.
01:51:00 <noobexterminator> Damn
01:51:11 <noobexterminator> Ok
01:51:26 <noobexterminator> Ill be using aurora store
01:51:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. At this moment we don't have our own app store, so you'll have to find the apps yourself, either via the Aurora Store, or finding them directly from upstream.
01:51:33 <TheJollyRoger> Oh good, good, that should save you a lot of trouble.
01:52:12 <TheJollyRoger> So note -- because we don't include Play Services, this means that some apps won't like GrapheneOS, because they might be dependent on Play Services.
01:52:15 <noobexterminator> YES
01:52:23 <noobexterminator> SIRRRRR
01:52:34 <TheJollyRoger> If this is the case, for those apps, they may run in some unpredictable ways.
01:52:34 <TheJollyRoger> Arr ^_^.
01:52:50 <TheJollyRoger> Some may crash when you open them, others may run, but then complain that they can't connect, or that GSF is missing. Some may run fine, until they try to dial out to Google, get no answer, and then either crash or exit.
01:53:00 <ImLost> I am trying to install right now but running into a hang up when flashing. It's my first time messing around with custom roms. I have the bootloader unlocked, usb debugging and oem unlocking. I have control through adb and fastboot and can flash different stock roms with no problem.  When attempting to flash the grapheneos the results are:
01:53:04 <ImLost> PS C:\Users\toddm.DESKTOP-5RQSI1S\Desktop\Phone\platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows\platform-tools> .\flash-all.bat

01:53:08 <ImLost> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
01:53:23 <TheJollyRoger> Hi ImLost, looks like you followed an unoffcial guide that had you install a third-party version of fastboot.
01:53:29 <strcat[m]> ImLost: you're not following the official instructions
01:53:41 <noobexterminator> Ok ight imma go Setup my Phone with GRAPHENEOS GANG GANG
01:53:56 <strcat[m]> ImLost: please use either https://grapheneos.org/web/install (GUI web installer) or https://grapheneos.org/cli/install
01:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: I can give you a talk-through, but first you're going to need to uninstall that old version of fastboot.
01:54:05 <noobexterminator> Man i love grapheneOs
01:54:07 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: Congrats! :)
01:54:20 <strcat[m]>  * ImLost: please use either https://grapheneos.org/install/web (GUI web installer) or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
01:54:30 <strcat[m]> made a typo in the URLs
01:54:41 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: so if some apps don't run, it's probably because their authors didn't design them to function without Google, and they're crashing because they're trying to reach Google, find nothing, and have no fallback to function without it.
01:54:46 <noobexterminator> Listen to TheJollyRoger  he helped me setup GrapheneOS from step 1
01:54:49 <strcat[m]> in fact let me just add redirects for when I do that again
01:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe ^_^.
01:55:59 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: Some apps may experience weird behaviour, like your apps not displaying notifications until you open them, or needing to run in the foreground to properly display alerts. This is just due to the model that smartphone apps assume, of sleeping in the background until a server at Google says "hey wake up!" - which can't happen without Play Services.
01:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> So if you can, try to find apps that are not dependent on Google's Software Framework.
01:57:08 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: having people try https://grapheneos.org/install/web makes sense now
01:57:23 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: aye captain!
01:57:26 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: just note they still may need to install the driver via Windows Update
01:57:31 <strcat[m]> if they don't have it install automatically
01:57:40 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. The optional update!
01:58:36 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: I'm available for a talk-through, but as strcat[m] says, we include a graphical installer that may help you through.
01:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> Or rather, the GrapheneOS website does, haha.
01:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> If you still need help, I can do a talk-through.
02:01:56 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: don't forget to turn off OEM unlocking. You can do this by opening the developer options, and sliding the slider to off, then switching developer options "of."
02:01:57 <TheJollyRoger> *off"
02:02:16 <TheJollyRoger> You can always turn it back on later if you need it.
02:04:09 <ImLost> I've been trying to familiarize myself with android and this process over the past couple days and have flashed a couple different stock roms and custom recoveries.  Softbricked it lol saved it and now I'm here.  I'm starting to catch on.  I was following the instructions but I guess I left it with a different version of fastboot.  I imagine I
02:04:10 <ImLost> can flashing another version?  Before I go look into that though what version of android should I be trying to flash graphene from?
02:04:35 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: since GrapheneOS does not do cloud backups, it includes SeedVault. Look in the box your phone came in and there should be a USB-A-to-C plug in there, if it came with all its original accessories. If you have a spare USB drive, you can use SeedVault to back up your apps and contact list, although you must back up your shared storage separately.
02:04:59 <rny> TheJollyRoger: could technically, if the backup provider supports cloud backup
02:05:17 <rny> or to be more concise "the app provider for the backup provider"
02:05:22 <rny> what a mouthful
02:05:25 <TheJollyRoger> rny: oh yeah, ack.
02:05:47 <rny> i cant imagine explaining these things in speech, it is an invitation for error
02:05:50 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: correction, if you have a NextCloud account, that can do cloud backups.
02:05:55 <TheJollyRoger> Eech, yeah.
02:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: sorry, what are you trying to do?
02:06:55 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: the backups (but not the apps) are stored encrypted. So you must write down the recovery sentence, and if you lose it, say goodbye to your backups, they're gone for good if you don't have the recovery sentence.
02:07:35 <ImLost> I guess I need a different version of fastboot. I'll look elsewhere for that info but what version of android can I flash to graphene from. is the latest android 11 rom ok to flash from?
02:08:13 <TheJollyRoger> So take care of your recovery memnonic. It is used to regenerate the encryption keys and can't be reset.
02:08:29 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: try "fastboot --version" to see your version.
02:08:41 <TheJollyRoger> Note that versions that are incorrectly versioned, or out of date, will result in a brick.
02:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> Since they don't support autodetection.
02:08:59 <ImLost> 30.0.5-6877874
02:09:10 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: ok, looks like your version is good. Were you running from cmd?
02:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> Because if you were, you'll get that error since the installation uses powershell.
02:09:49 <ImLost> no I'm in power shell
02:09:55 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: try the Web installer then.
02:10:42 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
02:11:14 <ImLost> ok. I'll give it a shot and see where that takes me. Thank you.
02:11:21 <TheJollyRoger> ImLost: good luck!
02:12:03 <TheJollyRoger> If you still have trouble, let me know. I'm here somewhat sporadically but I usually do respond to pings.
02:12:31 <ImLost> Sounds great. Thank you again.
02:13:14 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, if ye wish to sail with us, welcome aboard the ship in advance!
02:17:29 <ke345> I got new pixel 3. It wants to upgrade to Android 11. Should I do it before installing graphene os or should I leave it in version 10?
02:17:52 <TheJollyRoger> ke345: yes, you should upgrade to the latest before installing GrapheneOS.
02:18:08 <ke345> OK. Thank you.
02:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise you may get a "bootloader too old" error.
02:47:55 <strcat[m]> we do flash the bootloader, etc.
02:48:18 <TheJollyRoger> One of these days, I want to write a satire on "Why we hate GrapheneOS, by the NSA" and make it say stuff like, "The defaults are safe and the security works transparently! We can't trick 'power users' into self-pwning by encouraging them to do unsafe things like sideload updates on unlocked bootloaders and then blaming the users!"
02:49:01 <rny> many power users do trade off security for convenience
02:49:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:49:07 <rny> despite knowing the risks
02:49:32 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. My old shame was back in my "Power User" days I would switch off the User Account Control, run as the administrator, and turn off Windows Update.
04:21:35 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1354615001638707200
04:29:44 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: yarr, splice the mainbrace!
04:32:09 <iam_shadow[m]> hey so I'm knew to flashing roms bear with me please, Im on windows with pixel4a opened up power shell by right clicking sunfish factory folder it is unzipped, when I type fastboot --version it says the term fastboot is not recognized.
04:32:46 <TheJollyRoger> iam_shadow[m]: You'll need to get the correct version of fastboot and start at the top.
04:33:39 <TheJollyRoger> iam_shadow[m]: you'll need to read everything on the installation guide very carefully, since you've skipped some steps, some of which start with setting your powershell aliases, then using curl to retrieve, verify, and unpack the official platform tools and add it to your command path.
05:29:05 <oldman_newuser> Hello.   Trying to restore a seedvault backup using nextcloud.  I can see the option as available and it says 'click ok to install'.  When I click there the screen backs up one to 'restore apps and data'.  so my question is ' does grapheneos support restoring a backup via nextcloud ?
05:29:34 <oldman_newuser> I am able to restore using a usb drive, so it is not a big deal just did not know what is supposed to work
05:30:31 <oldman_newuser> this is latest stable install on a pixel3xl.  and i realize that the config of all the apps will not restore do to the limitations of 'adb backup' or whatever it is called.  thanks
05:32:18 <oldman_newuser> Note that once a phone is up and running it is possible to backup via nextcloud.  it is the restoring that is not working for me.
09:22:16 <yippyyee> Does GrapheneOS have any particular concerns that require additional things out steps if I'd like to root it on my phone? It seems like magisk is the program people use for this. Can I just root GrapheneOS the same way one would the google stock rom?
09:27:33 <deappledapple> It's not officially supported
09:28:38 <bosch-0> Hello, I was having an issue with my fresh GrapheneOS install. I'm unable to add an account in the accounts menu
09:28:49 <bosch-0> any suggestions as to why this would be happening?
09:31:49 <oldman_newuser> bosch-0 you talking about a 'user account' or an external account that is in the account menu section
09:33:46 <bosch-0> user account
09:34:08 <bosch-0> in Settings > Accounts
09:34:48 <oldman_newuser> settings --> system --> multiple users .  you have to enable it.  then you still dont add them in settings --> accounts
09:35:26 <bosch-0> geez I fully missed that
09:35:36 <bosch-0> thanks so much!
09:35:42 <oldman_newuser> no problem .  I did too first time around
09:36:41 <yippyyee> So, has anyone ever rooted or failed to root grapheneos?
09:39:48 <oldman_newuser> yippyyee  brother I'm  just a lurker here but pretty sure the opinion of running rooted grapheneos is an anithesis to the goal of grapheneos.  YMMV.  I have never tried
09:41:14 <yippyyee> I run GrapheneOS for privacy. I want to root it so that I can have more control over how the phone works and if course just because.
09:44:21 <yippyyee> I guess I'll just have to do it and l co
09:45:04 <yippyyee> and I'll have to come back and let everyone know if it worked.
09:45:20 <take_a_deep_brea> yippyyee:  i personal messaged you.
09:46:12 <take_a_deep_brea> mind talking to me as i want to discuss things not relevant to the room ?
10:09:18 <somenerd[m]> > I run GrapheneOS for privacy. I want to root it so that I can have more control over how the phone works and if course just because.
10:09:18 <somenerd[m]> how would it increase privacy though
10:09:25 <somenerd[m]> if anything, it'd decrease privacy

11:18:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hi
11:18:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are some problems with shipping pixel 5 releases rn
11:19:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> So for the while I'll be doing unofficial releases for the 5
11:19:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you flash these you'll have to wipe data when moving to official
11:20:18 <somenerd[m]> and wipe while moving to the unofficial ones as well, right?
11:20:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> They will not be labelled as grapheneos either, I'm going for naming like
11:20:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> "hardened android based on GrapheneOS"
11:21:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some features like auditor and background updates won't be available
12:31:07 <tamqcrg[m]> Can I get into the off topic chat please?
12:37:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> so when can you expect my builds?
12:38:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> next security patch, probably a week after that
12:50:51 <yoge67855[m]> how do i make this in android studio?
12:51:41 <yoge67855[m]> get*
13:03:58 <Obskurius> Hi I hope this is the right place to ask this: I just flashed GrapheneOS (sunfish-factory-2021.01.23.03.zip) on my new Pixel 4a. I followed all steps of the official install page (https://grapheneos.org/install/cli) after locking the bootloader I am unable to boot the device/it always reboots into the bootloader. On the bottom it says: "Enter
13:03:58 <Obskurius> reason: no valid slot to boot" Does someone have an idea why?
13:48:54 <Obskurius> while executing ./flash-all.sh when it says "Wait for any device" and the phone shows the fastbootd menu should I select "reboot system" now or "reboot to bootloader" Does it make a difference?
14:00:59 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Obskurius: You shouldn't be running flash-all if fastboot says "Waiting for any device"
14:01:24 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Have you unlocked the bootloader successfully or did it also say "Waiting for any device"?
15:05:28 <Obskurius> SkyFox[kdeorg][m Sorry I meant that after executing flash-all when it comes to the point where it says "Waiting for any device". At this point i see the fastbootd screen on my phone and have the options "reboot", "reboot to bootloader", "shut down" and "recovery mode" (not certain with the last two but something like that). The flash-all process
15:05:29 <Obskurius> wont continue until I select one of these options.
15:05:29 <Obskurius> Yes it was possible to unlock the bootloader.
15:06:39 <Obskurius> I noticed the following error message in my terminal (sorry have overlooked it before): fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable.
15:07:04 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Does it output anything before "Waiting for any device"?
15:08:15 <Obskurius> Yea quite a lot. The bootloader reboots a few times.

15:16:32 <Guest0> it looks normal
15:16:51 <Guest0> is it done yet?
15:18:28 <Obskurius> no. After that I'm stuck at the bootloader. When i select "Start" it returns to the bootloader because "Enter reason: no valid slot to boot"
15:21:56 <Obskurius> I also tried the webUSB based installer: there it said after flashing: Invalid command update-super:super:wipe
15:22:06 <Guest0> recommend rebooting to recovery, sideloading stock OS OTA update with adb sideload and then trying to flash again with a better USB connection
15:24:19 <Obskurius> ok testing another usb port before that won't work? What ist adb sideload? I guess the OS OTA is the stock android from google for the pixel 4a right?
15:24:31 <Obskurius> thanks for the help :)
15:27:32 <Guest0> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-sideloading
15:28:18 <Obskurius> ok thanks
15:50:25 <jellybelly> Hi everyone, i have a question, when i have my screen locked with grapheneos pixel 4a, you can see for example signal and other apps that are running on the background, dont know how 2 post a picture,. Now yesterday my signal logo on lockscreen was red colored? What does that mean?
15:50:51 <jellybelly> Normally all apps that are active i see white on lockscreen, yesterday signal was red
15:53:56 <take_a_deep_brea> you mean signal like in tower signal strength ?
15:54:28 <jellybelly> Sorry, signal messenger app
15:54:53 <jellybelly> Normally when i get a messege on graphene i see a blue signal logo , this time it was red ?
15:58:35 <mynacol[m]> strcat So I narrowed the connections to dns.google/853 (8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8 and two ipv6 addresses) down to this scenario: Disable WiFi, enable Airplane mode. Then enable WiFi and wait until connected. Somewhere now NetGuard reports in the protocol and under DNS Daemon connection to the mentioned addresses. Will now try to do a packet capture
16:08:27 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <mynacol[m] "strcat So I narrowed the connect"> You should check router settings to see if it's using Google DNS, imo
16:15:11 <mynacol[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "You should check router settings"> I forgot to mention: 1. I am not the administrator of the used WiFi connection. 2. I am _very_ sure the network's configured DNS server (advertised through DHCP and router advertisements) is the one of the router, which forwards requests to the university DNS server. I can even check this by visiting https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ or similar sites. Alternatively,
16:15:11 <mynacol[m]> sniffing the connections of my PC with Wireshark. The network does not use Google's DNS servers.
16:23:51 <mynacol[m]> The same happens after disabling wifi and cellular connections you re-enable cellular connectivity (with mobile data on, of course). Then there are DNS queries to google DNS servers.
16:24:33 <mynacol[m]> But I just checked the NetGuard source code, and it seems to use the four detected Google DNS servers as type of fallback.
16:25:13 <mynacol[m]> Sorry for the confusion ☹️
16:29:33 <mynacol[m]> And probably during network setup when the network-provided DNS servers are not available, NetGuard uses the fallback, Google DNS servers.
16:44:29 <adeus[m]> Happy days! Downloading GrapheneOS sunfish from Graph servers at 14.8kb/s
16:44:39 <adeus[m]> At this rate I can have GrapheneOS ready by next week
16:44:55 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
16:45:03 <adeus[m]> Is a snail mail option?
16:45:55 <take_a_deep_brea> so your device is pixel 4a'.' right ?
16:45:59 <take_a_deep_brea> just checking cause we had two people recently flashing the other device and ....

16:47:53 <ixl4[m]> Hi all. After years on unsecured Samsung's then 3 years of apple I'm finally here. 4a on grapheme and quite frankly it feels liberating.
16:49:13 <ixl4[m]> Trying to adjust to using other apps and being on Linux for the last 2 its easier than I thought it would be. The mindset is already there.
17:08:59 <thestranger69> Hi, i just cant get waze app running on graphene, anyone knows what te problem could be?
17:09:36 <thestranger69> I want to mavigate with waze but it just doesnt work on graphene or i am doing somethibg wrong
17:11:56 <tidria[m]> pretty sure Waze has a play service dependency if I recall correctly
17:12:29 <thestranger69> It use 2 work few months ago
17:13:51 <tidria[m]> I'm sorry I'm not sure what changed then, if you need an alternative OsmAnd~ is good
17:19:18 <thestranger69> Okey thanx i ll try osmand
17:43:29 <bearded1[m]> I believe Google Maps is working without Google Play Services (GPS) now. It used to have a hard deny without GPS, now it just prompts you that you'll have a better experience but can choose to use without.
17:44:37 <bearded1[m]> I personally use OSMand~, but I won't claim that it is as good as Google Maps. IMO it can be useful to have Google Maps in a Shelter profile for availability when in a bind or if you needed traffix info, etc.
17:46:41 <bearded1[m]>  * I personally use OSMand~, but I won't claim that it is as good as Google Maps. IMO it can be useful to have Google Maps in a Shelter profile for availability when in a bind or if you needed traffic info, etc.

18:40:55 <entry1[m]> My bad, this is OT
19:02:28 <oldman_newuser> regarding waze I had to flash an older version, llike maybe a year ago, then was able to update to the latest.  I have moved on to something called 'magic earth'. works for me but I am not a road warrior
19:05:07 <oldman_newuser> this waze worked on grapheneos with pixel3xl com.waze_4.64.0.1-1022030_minAPI16(arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a)(nodpi)_apkmirror.com.apk
19:11:28 <oldman_newuser> Hello.   Trying to restore a seedvault backup using nextcloud.  I can see the option as available and it says 'click ok to install'.  When I click there the screen backs up one to 'restore apps and data'.  so my question is ' does grapheneos support restoring a backup via nextcloud ?
19:58:27 <adeus[m]> I have installed on arch Linux latest version of android tools followed the udev option I have also enabled oem unlocking but fast boot won’t recognize my pixel 4
19:59:39 <adeus[m]> Do I enable usb debugging ?

20:02:02 <adeus[m]> I can’t do
20:02:04 <nscnt[m]> You missed a step
20:02:13 <adeus[m]> Oh shit I missed that line
20:02:18 <adeus[m]> Thank you
20:51:38 <strcat[m]> mynacol: so yeah sounds like if you want that to change you have to ask NetGuard to switch their own fallback to something like Cloudflare DNS
20:51:45 <strcat[m]> I'm sure they have similar requirements
20:52:00 <strcat[m]> has to be a high availability public DNS server with anycast and servers around the world probably

21:25:08 <strcat[m]> the ongoing attacks on GrapheneOS by Copperhead have a substantial impact on you as a GrapheneOS user
21:25:28 <AppAraat[m]> https://nitter.net/GrapheneOS/status/1354124835849449473 - For people who don't like Twitter's interface.
21:25:40 <strcat[m]> over half of our expenses are covering legal fees for the ongoing legal conflict, and a substantial portion of developer time is taken up countering their escalating attacks against us
21:25:52 <strcat[m]> they're quite literally paying and bribing people to push their false narrative
21:26:12 <strcat[m]> they're identifying people that are 'thought leaders' in some way (bloggers, podcasters) and buying them phones, involving them in the business, etc.
21:26:41 <strcat[m]> they're making persistent attacks against us across multiple platforms: Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, etc. using a bunch of sockpuppet accounts
21:26:58 <strcat[m]> they have more time and they've been incredibly manipulative and sneaky with how they've approached it
21:27:24 <strcat[m]> and they're trying to misrepresent our attempts at defending ourselves as us somehow being the aggressors when they keep escalating this and are the ones who made it a legal conflict
21:27:25 <Stampy[m]> Who CopperheadOS?
21:27:38 <strcat[m]> please read the thread that's linked as a quote
21:27:59 <Stampy[m]> copperhead is better than graphenOS
21:28:08 <Stampy[m]> Lol its a joke

21:29:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah this fucking troll
21:30:37 <AppAraat[m]> well I'm kinda broke right now (and getting evicted soon), so I can't really donate anything of value, but pretty much every time I have a conversation about Android security with someone I always mention GrapheneOS.
21:31:14 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: the main thing we need help with is countering their false narrative across a bunch of platforms
21:31:28 <strcat[m]> I started this project in 2014 and I have never assigned copyright in any way to them
21:31:32 <strcat[m]> I was not an employee of that company
21:31:36 <strcat[m]> I own 50% of Copperhead
21:31:47 <strcat[m]> Copperhead was supposed to be sponsoring my work
21:32:01 <strcat[m]> James Donaldson manipulated me for years and used me as a tool for trying to enrich himself
21:32:09 <strcat[m]> and then once he decided I wasn't useful for that he screwed me over
21:32:22 <strcat[m]> and stole a huge amount of money people had contributed to my project in donations
21:32:25 <mishmasher[m]> Damn but, isn't copperhead discontinued? And even if it isn't how do they find the time to do all of this bullshit?
21:32:28 <strcat[m]> and then used that money to try to harm me in any way that he can
21:32:37 <JeremiahK[m]> So what can be done?
21:32:40 <strcat[m]> mishmasher: no, they forked my fork and fraudulently present it as the original
21:32:41 <AppAraat[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: has anything from the initial lawsuit become public so far?
21:32:48 <JeremiahK[m]>  * So what can be done by us?
21:32:54 <strcat[m]> they filed fraudulent copyright claims over it (luckily this is meaningless) falsely claiming I assigned copyright to them
21:32:58 <JeremiahK[m]> Donations?
21:33:01 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: yes
21:33:10 <strcat[m]> Jeremiah K: donations help
21:33:16 <strcat[m]> we also need people to spread the word about what they're doing
21:33:30 <strcat[m]> they're doing everything they can to cause harm to GrapheneOS, myself and the other developers
21:33:44 <strcat[m]> they are running misinformation campaigns against us
21:34:19 <AppAraat[m]> Interesting, I would very much like the documents that became public from that lawsuit.
21:34:19 <strcat[m]> spreading a false narrative and trying directing people to harass us
21:34:21 <strcat[m]> a few days ago they were raiding this channel spamming gore again which drove some of the community away
21:34:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw I'd like if you could pm me if you want to help against misinformation
21:34:22 <strcat[m]> they have paid people to do this stuff, including giving them phones and having them sell phones to people they dupe
21:34:24 <mishmasher[m]> And what are you guys doing to counter them?
21:34:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please do not go and try something by yourself
21:34:31 <strcat[m]> they take our work, our documentation, our blog posts, our research and posts on Twitter, etc,.
21:34:35 <strcat[m]>  * they take our work, our documentation, our blog posts, our research and posts on Twitter, etc.
21:34:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> You might make the situation worse. There is a proper way to do this
21:34:40 <strcat[m]> and then try to present that as something they did
21:34:41 <JeremiahK[m]> Is it written up somewhere?  A blog post?  Something easy to share to raise awareness?
21:34:48 <strcat[m]> this is how they prop themselves up and continue going
21:34:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Jeremiah K: I'm working on it
21:34:59 <strcat[m]> Jeremiah K: yes, multiple threads on my Twitter account, and there's a longer form legal document published on our site
21:35:03 <strcat[m]> which will be updated to the new revision soon
21:35:15 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/legal/Micay_%20Copperhead_%20Statement%20of%20Defendant%20and%20Counterclaim.pdf
21:35:20 <strcat[m]> that will be updated soon
21:35:36 <strcat[m]> to cover additional things such as their registry of grapheneos.ca and grapheneos.net which they redirected to their site to confuse people and trick them
21:35:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway guys for help against misinformation please pm me
21:36:00 <strcat[m]> it doesn't cover most of what they've been doing to harm us because it isn't relevant to our legal case
21:36:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Doing anything rash yourself will worsen the situation
21:36:09 <strcat[m]>  * it doesn't cover most of what they've been doing to harm us because it isn't relevant to this legal case
21:36:17 <strcat[m]> yes, be friendly, don't harass people, stick to facts
21:36:24 <strcat[m]> but please help with countering their misinformation campaign against us
21:36:30 <AppAraat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Jeremiah K: I'm working on it "> If you could also then link to the official public documents from the lawsuit as sources, that would be great. Also, if you decide to post that article somewhere (like on HN) then let me know so that I can upvote.
21:36:48 <strcat[m]> when you see people mention CopperheadOS explain to them how they've copied our work without credit, falsely claimed to be the authors/owners of it, etc.
21:36:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't want an angry mob going and harassing CopperheadOS and we do not intend to harass anyone like they are right now
21:36:59 <strcat[m]> that applies to the OS work, the documentation, blog posts, all kinds of other stuff
21:37:05 <AppAraat[m]> I would very much like to be informed about something when countering misinformation about said something.
21:37:11 <strcat[m]> they threaten volunteers and others working on GrapheneOS
21:37:26 <mishmasher[m]> Is there something you can do legally against their harassments campaigns?
21:37:31 <strcat[m]> look at this as one example: https://renlord.com/posts/2020-03-25-copperheados-legal-threat/
21:38:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "when you see people mention Copp"> Also please pm me for an example. There are ways you can do this that will make the other party actually listen to you
21:38:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't just go in and say "hey CopperheadOS is a fucking scam"
21:38:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> That hardly helps
21:38:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> If anything it harms us
21:40:47 <strcat[m]> explain to people that I started this as an open source project in 2014, the work was done by me and owned by me the entire time and that was an explicit agreement with them from the start
21:40:52 <strcat[m]> and I also own 50% of Copperhead to this day
21:41:02 <strcat[m]> I am speaking as the co-owner of the company, this is what happened
21:41:09 <strcat[m]> the company was founded in late 2015
21:41:37 <strcat[m]> and it was explicitly agreed upon that my open source project would remain mine, and that the company would maintain proprietary variants of it for clients as needed
21:41:45 <strcat[m]> when what I wanted for the project didn't align with their needs
21:41:48 <strcat[m]> that was an explicit agreement
21:42:03 <strcat[m]> it was also an explicit agreement that the donations were being made to my open source project and were mine to allocate
21:42:09 <strcat[m]> I have chat logs proving this too
21:42:21 <strcat[m]> and that was the understanding of people who donated, that is what they were told
21:42:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might want to mention how much was stolen btw
21:42:57 <strcat[m]> and yet at the end when they decided to attempt a takeover against the terms that had been agreed upon, an amount of money worth hundreds of thousands of dollars now was stolen from the project
21:43:09 <strcat[m]> donated money
21:43:16 <strcat[m]> including from people still around in this community
21:43:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also pm
21:45:35 <mishmasher[m]> Wooow what a dirty world. It's always amazing projects like this that suffer from corporate greed...😒
21:45:38 <strcat[m]> @room we really need help with these escalating attacks on the project by Copperhead, the expenses are enormous and their focus is entirely on harming us rather than building anything - we don't have time as developers of the project to focus on countering what they're doing
21:46:10 <strcat[m]> as a GrapheneOS user: we would have 3 additional full time developers (or more, if they were in very low cost of living countries like anupritaisno1) if we did not have to cover these monthly costs on lawyers
21:46:54 <strcat[m]> we currently have 2 full time developers and a dozen part time ones contributing when they have free time, but full time developers are a drastically different thing
21:47:08 <strcat[m]> they are attacking the project in multiple ways
21:47:31 <strcat[m]> they're trying to present themselves as victims and try projecting what they have been doing onto us based on us trying to defend ourselves from them
21:47:35 <mishmasher[m]> <strcat[m] "as a GrapheneOS user: we would h"> But, is there a chance to get money from court? Suing them for the damage done?
21:47:48 <strcat[m]> don't be fooled: they make an extremely expensive and poorly implemented closed source ripoff of our work
21:47:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> mishmasher: we are doing that, please read the counterclaim
21:47:55 <strcat[m]> they spend very little of their resources actually building anything
21:48:02 <strcat[m]> their focus is on harming the open source project they continue ripping off
21:48:08 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <mishmasher[m] "But, is there a chance to get mo"> The counter-claim includes this, iirc
21:48:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: please pm me
21:48:21 <strcat[m]> yes and it includes more in the latest revision which I'll upload soon and publish
21:48:27 <strcat[m]> for now refer to the existing revision
22:01:58 <tempest2478[m]> I'm cheering for graphene os and Daniel. Copperhead has gone too far.
22:08:50 <ruski[m]> that behaviour is totally unacceptable. they steal open source code and then try to ruin the reputation of those from whom they stole?
22:08:58 <ruski[m]>  * that behaviour is totally unacceptable. they steal open source code and then try to ruin the reputation and project of those from whom they stole?
22:09:02 <strcat[m]> ruski: yes
22:09:09 <strcat[m]> ruski: their entire project is just a poorly done ripoff of my work
22:09:15 <strcat[m]> they don't even understand most of it
22:09:27 <strcat[m]> they've stripped my name off my blog posts, documentation, etc.
22:09:41 <strcat[m]> and those don't even apply to their product but they use them to make it seem like they have technical know how
22:10:04 <strcat[m]> and they keep parroting stuff that I write / say (poorly, and showing a lack of understanding to people who know about it)
22:10:05 <saucy-salamander> So what's the best way to help if you are not a developer or have "influence". I assume donate?
22:10:19 <strcat[m]> donating helps, as does helping to counter their false narratives when you see them
22:10:44 <saucy-salamander> <strcat[m] "donating helps, as does helping "> Consider it done.
22:10:46 <strcat[m]> my open source project was started in 2014 and I have always owned and controlled it, the GrapheneOS repositories are still the original repositories from way back then
22:10:52 <strcat[m]> I never assigned any copyright to them
22:10:57 <strcat[m]> and they forked the project after screwing it over
22:11:17 <strcat[m]> to create a CLOSED SOURCE product with license enforcing (DRM)
22:11:31 <strcat[m]> which they have poorly maintained and they simply keep copying our work
22:11:47 <strcat[m]> while trying to destroy the project through threats and baseless legal threats / lawsuits
22:11:58 <strcat[m]> they reach out to anyone heavily involved in the project and community
22:12:04 <strcat[m]> try to manipulate them or intimidate them
22:12:10 <strcat[m]> they reach out to our supporters / partners doing the same
22:12:11 <ruski[m]> how would they even maintain their project if they ruin yours?
22:12:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> ruski: you ever hear of that story of the man who cut the tree branch they were sitting on?
22:12:39 <ruski[m]> that's cutting off your nose to spite your face
22:12:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> CopperheadOS is that man
22:12:57 <strcat[m]> ruski: they just coast by on their BS marketing / branding - they just have a less private and secure variant of AOSP with a 12 year old's concept of a hacker aesthetic (just look at their site - green text on black, flashing / flickering things, glitching)
22:13:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: tbh if I saw my phone glitching
22:13:25 <strcat[m]> for an idea of how much of a joke the company is, their CEO spends his time on Telegram, Twitter, editing Wikipedia himself via sockpuppets / VPNs
22:13:25 <ruski[m]> know if they're doing the same to calyxos?
22:13:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'd be like "hey GPU, are you alright?"
22:13:37 <strcat[m]> ruski: no they don't care about it
22:14:17 <strcat[m]> and they've successfully used their community as a tool to harm us, they're actively involved there with sockpuppets
22:14:23 <madaidan[m]> <ruski[m] "know if they're doing the same t"> They're pining after Calyx rn
22:14:32 <strcat[m]> and the developers, etc. don't care that it's happening
22:14:43 <strcat[m]> would rather not talk about that atm
22:15:03 <ruski[m]> man that's really heartbreaking and i hate that this is happening to you
22:15:09 <faxing[m]> So, what prompted Copperhead to start doing all of this?
22:15:20 <faxing[m]> Cause I know it's been a long term ongoing thing
22:15:20 <ruski[m]> i will do anything i can to help
22:16:08 <strcat[m]> faxing: the CEO decided that the arrangement of sponsoring the open source project wasn't a good way for him to get himself money anymore
22:16:20 <fire_free[m]> <strcat[m] "and they forked the project afte"> In summary they are pure shit
22:16:22 <strcat[m]> faxing: and decided to try coercing me into turning over ownership and control of my project to him
22:16:43 <strcat[m]> faxing: he broke all our agreements, he used his control of the domain registration, etc. to hijack the infrastructure
22:16:57 <strcat[m]> he stole all the donations, which he'd tricked me into letting him handle in order to offload work from me unrelated to development
22:17:10 <strcat[m]> he spent multiple years manipulating and tricking me
22:17:25 <strcat[m]> pretending to be my friend
22:17:33 <strcat[m]> pretending he cared about me as a friend
22:18:23 <faxing[m]> Oh shit
22:18:26 <faxing[m]> That's so fucked
22:18:53 <strcat[m]> faxing: and then they forked all my projects and turned it into a shitty branding-based closed source product
22:19:14 <strcat[m]> and they tried to pay cheap contractors to port it forward and develop DRM for license enforcement
22:19:16 <strcat[m]> etc
22:19:20 * alex_9836472[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QEqXentzxYvaaXqomaOTSZnP/message.txt >
22:19:27 <strcat[m]> they totally failed at it and ended up having to keep copying our work
22:20:10 <strcat[m]> so even today, they continue copying the work that we do
22:20:11 <strcat[m]> they spend nearly all their resources / time trying to harm us in any way that they can
22:20:14 <strcat[m]> you can see the CEO just spends all his time on Telegram and other platforms trying to manipulate people and cause harm to GrapheneOS, myself and the other developers
22:20:22 <fire_free[m]> All kidding aside, they're really shitty 🤢🤢
22:20:27 <strcat[m]> spends all day reaching out to people, concocting schemes to manipulate people
22:20:33 <madaidan[m]> <fire_free[m] "In summary they are pure shit"> Shit sits still. Copperhead is subshit at this point.
22:20:43 <strcat[m]> they've been buying people phones / bribing them and having them post blog posts and talk about them on podcasts etc
22:20:44 <strcat[m]> paid content
22:20:45 <strcat[m]> not marked as such
22:21:01 <mynacol[m]> alex_9836472: What is the output so far? Maybe <Waiting for device>
22:21:07 <strcat[m]> they've done this with 'thought leaders' in the Bitcoin privacy world - i.e. people with blogs, podcasts, etc. that people follow
22:21:17 <strcat[m]> they've involved some of them in selling phones for ridiculous prices
22:21:21 <mynacol[m]> * alex_9836472: What is the output so far? Maybe `<Waiting for device>`
22:21:35 <strcat[m]> you can see if you look into it that most of the people supporting them are from that world
22:21:54 <strcat[m]> it's kinda funny how cryptocurrency people are so easily and consistently scammed / duped
22:21:59 <alex_9836472[m]> <mynacol[m] "alex_9836472: What is the output"> There is no output at all.
22:22:11 <strcat[m]> kinda funny, but also really not funny, because of all the harm they are doing
22:22:22 <ruski[m]> is there a platform that they are using for harass you?
22:22:35 <ruski[m]>  * is there a platform that they are using to harass you?
22:22:44 <alex_9836472[m]> Previously it was <Waiting for device> but I think I have since resolved that by moving the fastboot to the usr/local/bin
22:22:46 <strcat[m]> ruski: they're spreading attacks on me across multiple platforms
22:22:50 <strcat[m]> ruski: primarily Telegram, Twitter, etc.
22:22:58 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "it's kinda funny how cryptocurre"> You would think they'd be wary of scams at this point
22:23:02 <strcat[m]> ruski: and then as a result of that I get harassed by their followers
22:23:21 <strcat[m]> ruski: they're heavily invested in spreading attacks about GrapheneOS and the developers
22:23:38 <mynacol[m]> alex_9836472: So what is the output of `fastboot --version`?
22:23:51 <strcat[m]> and they try to misrepresent the limited time we spend trying to defend ourselves from all this as us being the ones perpetrating it
22:24:08 <strcat[m]> they're regularly spreading false narratives about what happened and using tons of sockpuppets to promote it
22:24:09 <mynacol[m]> alex_9836472: And from what OS are you installing?
22:24:09 <alex_9836472[m]> Can I cancel the running script to run `fastboot --version`?
22:24:17 <alex_9836472[m]> PoP OS (Ubuntu)
22:24:18 <ruski[m]> what kind of people use their OS if they're so easily manipulated?
22:24:25 <strcat[m]> alex_9836472: please just use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:24:29 <mynacol[m]> <alex_9836472[m] "Can I cancel the running script "> Yes
22:24:53 <strcat[m]> alex_9836472: install the package with the udev rules (covered there) and use the web installer
22:25:11 <strcat[m]> make sure to use a high quality USB cable
22:25:25 <ruski[m]> alex_9836472: the only way i managed to get it to work was by running everything as sudo
22:25:48 <ruski[m]>  * alex_9836472: the only way i managed to get it to work was by running everything as root
22:25:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <ruski[m] "alex_9836472: the only way i man"> That's probably because of missing udev rules
22:26:20 <strcat[m]> ruski: means you didn't have the udev rules or didn't reconnect device after installing them
22:26:26 <alex_9836472[m]> I saw that it was experimental so opted to use the cli. I would need to download a chromium browser to try the web guide so I would prefer to try it with the CLI as people appear to be kindly offering to help
22:26:28 <strcat[m]> there's a section on it in both guides
22:26:54 <alex_9836472[m]> I have installed the udev rules
22:27:04 <strcat[m]> make sure to use a reliable USB cable / port
22:27:13 <strcat[m]> USB C cable that comes with the phone or a high quality USB A to USB C cable
22:27:17 <mynacol[m]> <alex_9836472[m] "I have installed the udev rules"> And reconnected the device?
22:27:20 <strcat[m]> possible you have a bad USB C port on computer
22:27:42 <alex_9836472[m]> Thank you - I am using a high quality cable and have reconnected the device after installing the udev rules
22:28:17 <alex_9836472[m]> Ok, I shall try with USB C - USB C
22:28:18 <strcat[m]> alex_9836472: don't move fastboot to /usr/local/bin
22:28:26 <strcat[m]> just run exactly the commands it has listed
22:28:50 <strcat[m]> alex_9836472: do the 'obtaining fastboot' section again in a fresh terminal and make sure fastboot --version shows the right one
22:28:56 <strcat[m]> don't skip the PATH command
22:29:12 <strcat[m]> and don't open a new terminal after doing that - you have to continue using the one where you set up PATH to point at the platform-tools directory
22:29:37 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you unlocked with fastboot already then did something like closing the terminal and starting over without PATH set up
22:29:48 <alex_9836472[m]> Ok - I will do the obtaining fastboot section again.
22:34:49 <alex_9836472[m]> I have done that and get fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874. When I run ./flash-all.sh I get < waiting for any device >. Does this suggest that it is a USB issue?
22:36:00 <alex_9836472[m]> When I try a different USB C port there is no output in the terminal
22:36:03 <mynacol[m]> alex_9836472: You are in the bootloader? And you have already unlocked the bootloader?
22:36:23 <alex_9836472[m]> Bootloader is unlocked
22:36:51 <alex_9836472[m]> The screen says Fastboot Mode
22:37:01 <mynacol[m]> Alright
22:38:28 <mynacol[m]> The most probable problem is the USB port or cable. I don't see much space for another reason
22:38:37 <alex_9836472[m]> At one point about an hour ago I ran the first command from the flash-all bash script and I think it worked because the screen cycled on and off then rebooted.
22:38:37 <alex_9836472[m]> Since then I have been trying to just run the flash-all script properly
22:39:15 <alex_9836472[m]> <mynacol[m] "The most probable problem is the"> Thanks, I will try another USB
22:40:46 <mishmasher[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: man... Ready all of this has angered me and gave me a disgusting feeling in my gut... Especially since this is a project that helps people.
22:41:43 <alex_9836472[m]> 3rd usb port and cable combination worked!
22:41:56 <alex_9836472[m]> Thank you for your help
22:43:01 <mynacol[m]> alex_9836472: Alright. Congrats! 🎉
22:44:11 <mynacol[m]> alex_9836472: Don't forget to follow the additional steps. Lock the bootloader again, check the integrity with the Attestation app and you may want to disable OEM unlocking in the settings again

23:00:54 <alex_9836472[m]> Is there a guide for how to install apps? Is the typical way to install FDroid apk?
23:04:02 <nora[m]1> It's how I do it for most of the apps
23:06:17 <pacman37[m]> <alex_9836472[m] "Is there a guide for how to inst"> The project leaves that part for the users. They choose the sources they trust.
23:07:27 <nora[m]1> First message here, I'm gratefull for your work !
23:07:27 <nora[m]1> I've used LineageOS for a long time and since my last phone died I'm on Graphene and I'm loving it!
23:11:40 <TheJollyRoger> nora[m]1, alex_9836472[m], Yarr, welcome aboard the ship! If you find GrapheneOS useful, please consider helping us out at https://grapheneos.org/donate - the project is funded entirely by donations, and that keeps this ship sailing!
23:11:50 <TheJollyRoger> mishmasher[m]: woah, you rock! Much appreciated!
23:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> alex_9836472[m]: There's several ways you can install apps without an app store. The easiest way is to simply open them via the file manager on GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS will follow the standard android certificate model, where updates to an app, must be signed by the certificate that installed the previous update or was authorized by the previous update, all the way back to the certificate used
23:12:56 <TheJollyRoger> to first install the app.
23:13:45 <TheJollyRoger> Note that if you obtain the APK from another application, such as Aurora Store, or Vanadium, by default, GrapheneOS does not have them whitelisted to sideload other apps, so you'll need to give it permission by adding it to the whitelist the first time.
23:14:41 <alex_9836472[m]> Thank you
23:14:47 <TheJollyRoger> Because GrapheneOS does not have any privileged extensions and is set to "deny all" at this moment, unattended app installations are not allowed, so you'll be asked to confirm if you want the app or an update to be installed. There's nothing big for this, it just asks you for your consent first.
23:16:09 <TheJollyRoger> alex_9836472[m]: you're welcome! Something you may need to take note of: if you use multiple user profiles, apps installed in one profile, must be the same version *or* newer versions than the ones that are in the others. This is to avoid downgrade or "roll back" attacks where an attacker loads an older and more vulnerable, but legitimately signed version of the app.
23:17:21 <TheJollyRoger> So if you manually consent to an app being installed and your handset replies Error: App Not Installed! in response, it may be because it believes you are trying to install an older version, or the certificate doesn't match.
23:19:41 <TheJollyRoger> This can happen to some apps on F-Droid that are incorrectly versioned, or follow a strange and nonstandard versioning scheme that Android doesn't like.
