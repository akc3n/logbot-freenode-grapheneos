04:03:40 <TheJollyRoger> SwankyBarbecue4[: What would happen is that when the 4 becomes obsolete, it essentially will remain where it is frozen at that point in time, while exploits continue becoming better.
04:05:09 <SwankyBarbecue4[> Hey TheJollyRoger ! Good to see ya!
04:05:12 <TheJollyRoger> Lineage is significantly less secure, since they use userdebug builds and don't support verified boot, attestation, and they reduce the restrictiveness of the mandatory access controls.
04:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hey SwankyBarbecue4[, likewise! It looks like the bridge is fixed now, so I can see you again.
04:06:17 <SwankyBarbecue4[> hahaha you always have good jokes :)
04:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe :)
04:07:14 <TheJollyRoger> I've always considered Lineage and GrapheneOS to be two very very different projects with very very different and mutually exclusive goals; Lineage aims to be very permissive and cater to people who would like to play system administrator with their phone.
04:08:33 <TheJollyRoger> Wheras GrapheneOS aims to reduce the attack surface, cage the bugs, restrict software to prevent it from running amok on your system, and mitigate exploits before they become vulnerabilities.
04:09:36 <deappledapple> <TheJollyRoger "I've always considered Lineage a"> Do you mind answering why is this the case or conclusion? (On https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210114#c6531834)

04:22:21 <TheJollyRoger> The difference between a malicious app and an insecure app just comes down to intent. Of course, intent is not a practical matter when it comes to computer security given that a computer just runs code, it doesn't gauge the intentions of who tells it what to run.

04:32:08 <strcat[m]> what step are you on, what have you done so far
04:33:01 <Sam7> I installed fastboot on my pureos system. Verified version is 30.0  enabled OEM unlock. But Fastboot Flashing Unlock is not working
04:33:22 <strcat[m]> is the phone in the bootloader menu?
04:33:27 <strcat[m]> and connected with a proper USB cable?
04:33:45 <Sam7> yes. using the cable that came wit phone. I'm at bootloader menu
04:34:10 <Sam7> menu has options for barcode, recovery mode, rescue mode, etc.
04:34:52 <Sam7> I did update phone to android 11 before starting
04:37:29 <strcat[m]> Sam7: well, you're not on a supported OS for installing
04:37:38 <strcat[m]> read the info on udev rules
04:37:45 <strcat[m]> try as root if you're missing that

04:41:22 <TheLoneWanderer[> They mean you should be using an OS like Ubuntu/Debian
04:42:08 <Sam7> Well, PureOS is debian based. I've got everything installed they wanted. Signify, etc.

10:14:56 <deappledapple> <Thatcher[m] "I really want to lock down and h"> Anything that can be disabled won't affect it more or less (most of the time)
10:15:26 <deappledapple> Like it can function without that permission (such as AOSP Music Player without storage permission)

12:22:13 <deappledapple> <eric80 "I would like to contact someone "> You can just ask here, and the commands in official installation guide (https://grapheneos.org/install) can work pretty much copy paste for the most part except for obtaining images, where you just change sunfish with your device's codename

13:24:29 <COVID-1984> strcat[m]: how do you keep track of new tracking-related stuff added to chromium that's taken out of vanadium? I'm wondering about a CI approach with wireguard where something like this happens: 1) new version built 2) new version smoke tested with wireguard running: a) open some known websites b) detect certain known google URLs and/or IP blocks 3) fail or succeed the "new tracking" test.
13:34:43 <strcat[m]> COVID-1984: it doesn't have tracking to remove
13:35:00 <strcat[m]> there are other things that should be disabled
13:35:03 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to work on that
13:35:23 <strcat[m]> not much point in doing CI to test something that is known to not be done yet
13:43:49 <COVID-1984> Can you point me to where those two things are listed? I was more talking about Google squeezing things into the releases...
13:44:25 <COVID-1984> I figured a test like that could catch stuff that many have missed.
13:45:50 <chris42> What logging option are there actually in GrapheneOS. I am right now used to apps like Matlog with root access. What is the Graphene way?
13:52:58 <strcat[m]> logging as in the logcat logs? that doesn't require root access
13:53:02 <strcat[m]> it's for development though
13:53:33 <strcat[m]> if you're a developer then you should probably get familiar with adb shell and the utilities it provides
13:54:04 <strcat[m]> you can grant development permissions (including logcat access) to apps with adb
14:11:24 <chris42> yeah, I use adb logcat. Thought that it might be the way left. Thx
14:11:50 <strcat[m]> chris42: you can also grant development permissions including logging to apps
14:11:53 <strcat[m]> there are apps supporting that
14:12:17 <strcat[m]> there's absolutely no need for them to use app-accessible root access for logcat access, there's a permission for it...
14:14:32 <chris42> oh ok... will need to check that. So far I always thought each app can only see their respective logging... hence the root requirement
14:16:14 <strcat[m]> chris42: again, there are development permissions only available via adb
14:16:27 <strcat[m]> chris42: official Android has no such thing as app-accessible root
14:16:35 <strcat[m]> userdebug builds have su for adb shell and adb root, never that
14:21:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is a read logs permission btw
14:28:03 <strcat[m]> already said that multiple times
14:28:28 <strcat[m]> it's a development permission that has to be granted via adb shell
14:28:50 <strcat[m]> there are a few other permissions that can be granted as developer option permissions
14:29:25 <strcat[m]> don't understand why what I said in my initial answer is being ignored
14:31:14 <chris42> ? what is ignored? Did I?
14:33:29 <strcat[m]> both you and anupritaisno1 are talking about it as if I didn't give the answer in my initial response
14:34:04 <strcat[m]> I wasn't responding to you there
14:34:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: yeah I deleted that message, ignore it
14:36:00 <chris42> all fine.. no worries here... sometimes it can take a while to get things right via a chat... especially if you are non native speaker, like me... just because I ask to clarify it doesn't mean I doubt what you say

16:14:52 <mbr0025> New graphene user here and ran into an issue attempting to install graphene onto a pixel 4a using Arch Linux. Following the official guides, I got the phone unlocked and the bootloader is ready to go. However, at the next step, which is to run ./flash-all.sh, the command hangs, i.e. it has been stuck at ./flash-all.sh for the past 12 hours with no
16:14:52 <mbr0025> output. I've also run this command both as sudo and as root.  I can communicate with the phone by issuing the command "fastboot devices" which returns the serial number of the phone. The phone remains at the bootloader main screen where the device state is "unlocked". I have tried running the first command in flash-all.sh individually as well, and
16:14:53 <mbr0025> that hangs too. Any suggestions? Thanks!
16:19:12 <dar_gomml[m]> <mbr0025 "New graphene user here and ran i"> also stuck here

16:43:46 <mbr0025> catfish[m] this worked! installation is now proceeding!
16:44:57 <mbr0025> catfish[m] i think the guide should include this tip
16:48:37 <catfish[m]> mbr0025: think it's peculiar to Linux but I had to do that on 3 installations the other night. Perhaps strcat could update the guide.
16:48:38 <catfish[m]> Follow rest of the guide though. Wait for it to complete then lock your bootloader 😀
16:54:46 <mbr0025> catfish[m] install is complete, bootloader is locked, and i'm in. thanks for the help!
16:59:43 <strcat[m]> that shouldn't be required
16:59:59 <strcat[m]> the guide stresses the importance of a working / reliable USB stack
17:00:08 <strcat[m]> OS USB implementation, USB controller / port, USB cable
17:00:25 <strcat[m]> I don't want it to become a USB troubleshooting guide
17:04:35 <TheLoneWanderer[> Is there an alternative to using Windows Updates for drivers?
17:07:52 <mbr0025> strcat[m] If it helps, the equipment I was using included a Lenovo Thinkpad x1 carbon, Arch Linux with all the latest updates, Pixel4a with all latest updates installed previous to flashing, and using the factory supplied USB-C cable
17:08:53 <mbr0025> running Arch, 5.4.67-1-MANJARO
17:11:35 <dar_gomml[m]> <strcat[m] "I don't want it to become a USB "> yeah this seems fundamental, as each time i installed Graphene OS I ran into problems with fastboot/usb. i tried 4 different devices succeed..
17:12:00 <dar_gomml[m]> run fact: the oldest device (MBP) worked
17:12:53 <dar_gomml[m]> * fun fact: the oldest device (MBP) worked
17:19:04 <strcat[m]> mbr0025: manjaro isn't arch
17:19:44 <strcat[m]> perhaps it would be best if we recommended against using Linux distributions due to hardware support issues
17:19:56 <strcat[m]> the guide works well for most people
17:20:12 <strcat[m]> it's not capable of covering all of the possible ways that your USB stack could be broken
17:20:19 <strcat[m]> and I don't want to include strange workarounds in it
17:20:26 <strcat[m]> rebooting the device between each step is not needed
17:20:30 <theychuckthisfro> Does Debian work?
17:20:31 <strcat[m]> and the flash-all script does not do that...
17:20:38 <strcat[m]> the flash-all script runs multiple fastboot commands
17:20:47 <strcat[m]> so I don't see how it can be claimed that rebooting between each command is needed
17:20:55 <strcat[m]> when the script successfully ends up running 12 of them
17:21:12 <strcat[m]> theychuckthisfromyou: the guide covers the supported distributions where it is regularly tested
17:21:21 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
17:21:36 <strcat[m]> covers everything needed to install successfully - at least for most people
17:21:41 <theychuckthisfro> Got it.
17:21:46 <strcat[m]> the vast majority of people who follow it don't experience issues
17:22:08 <strcat[m]> a lot of people don't follow it and use unofficial guides with serious issues
17:22:35 <mbr0025> strcat[m] understood and appreciate your decision... in my case the interesting thing was that i only had to reload the bootloader a single time, and all subsequent fastboot commands in the script ran successfully after that; i think this differs from the other user who reported having to restart the bootloader for each step
17:23:50 <strcat[m]> restarting for each step doesn't make sense
17:24:05 <strcat[m]> mbr0025: it's possible to end up in a situation where fastboot has pending data in either direction that wasn't handled
17:24:13 <strcat[m]> due to faulty USB connection, faulty USB stack in the OS, etc.
17:24:24 <strcat[m]> it isn't good at resetting it back to a working state once it's screwed up
17:24:42 <strcat[m]> it's a really simple protocol and depends on USB actually working as specified
17:24:47 <dar_gomml[m]> <strcat[m] "restarting for each step doesn't"> it really does not i know, however it did the trick
17:25:03 <strcat[m]> you know the flash-all.sh script runs a dozen fastboot commands?
17:25:10 <strcat[m]> it does multiple erases, flash commands, etc
17:25:17 <strcat[m]> it boots to fastbootd, flashes more stuff
17:25:23 <strcat[m]> boots back to bootloader at the end
17:25:38 <strcat[m]> it's quite strange if that all works fine but yet you need to reboot between steps like unlocking and starting the flashing
17:25:44 <strcat[m]> that isn't required
17:25:56 <strcat[m]> sounds like your USB connection doesn't work
17:26:15 <strcat[m]> perhaps rebooting deals with that by resetting the connection, but we can't give that kind of advice
17:26:55 <strcat[m]> I think most people are going to experience problems with their USB connection during the flashing
17:27:10 <strcat[m]> not for unlocking - that's a tiny amount of data back and forth
17:27:17 <strcat[m]> 1 packet to the phone, 1 packet back
17:27:32 <strcat[m]> if you can't do that reliability, it's hard to see how flashing could work
17:27:36 <strcat[m]>  * if you can't do that reliably, it's hard to see how flashing could work
17:29:09 <strcat[m]> we could give the advice that if your USB connection breaks or cuts out somehow, you might want to try rebooting the bootloader menu
17:29:21 <strcat[m]> but it isn't something that should be happening
17:29:41 <strcat[m]> definitely not required to install via working hardware / OS
17:44:08 <strcat[m]> and if you have such an unreliable connection to the phone, the WebUSB installer we're making is going to have a lot of trouble, since something more automated will be harder to coax into working with broken hardware
17:44:19 <strcat[m]> (or broken hardware support - which is common with the Linux kernel on random hardware)
17:45:03 <dar_gomml[m]> <strcat[m] "we could give the advice that if"> that be helpful for those: a note saying if anything strange happens during fastboot commands the cable/hardware pairing has some issues. strange things like, sometime commands work/sometimes not/interruptions of transfers, etc...
17:45:30 <strcat[m]> we do talk about USB a fair bit already
17:45:34 <strcat[m]> it's hard to cover everything about that
17:45:46 <strcat[m]> and I don't want it to be brought up repeatedly throughout the guide
17:46:05 <strcat[m]> > You need a USB cable for attaching the device to a laptop or desktop. Whenever possible, use the high quality standards compliant USB-C cable packaged with the device. If your computer doesn't have any USB-C ports, you'll need a high quality USB-C to USB-A cable. You should avoid using a USB hub such as the front panel on a desktop computer case. Connect directly to a rear port on a desktop or the ports on a laptop.
17:46:05 <strcat[m]> Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.
17:46:21 <strcat[m]> > Installing from an OS in a virtual machine is not recommended. USB passthrough is often not reliable. To rule out these problems, install from an OS running on bare metal. Virtual machines are also often configured to have overly limited memory and storage space.
17:46:34 <strcat[m]> dar_gomml: so we could further elaborate and note that the Linux kernel on a lot of hardware doesn't have reliable USB support
17:46:48 <strcat[m]> how much more information can we really give on USB though?
17:47:48 <strcat[m]> dar_gomml: I just don't really see it as within the scope of the guide to have a whole bunch of instructions on debugging USB hardware / OS issues
17:49:32 <dar_gomml[m]> <strcat[m] "dar_gomml: so we could further e"> not necessary, just name a few symptoms, that would have been helpful.
17:49:40 <dar_gomml[m]> wrong answer quotet
17:49:50 <dar_gomml[m]> * wrong answer quoted
17:50:05 <strcat[m]> it's usually because people are on Linux and don't have the udev rules + are running it as a regular user forbidden from accessing USB devices without specific rules permitting it
17:50:23 <strcat[m]> since that's how desktop Linux distributions handle things (i.e. not setting up automated handling for it)
17:51:14 <strcat[m]> I'm curious if that will be an issue with WebUSB
17:53:58 <TheLoneWanderer[> Does the lead GOS dev. frequent this server?
17:56:27 <Albakham[m]> That's him just before you
17:56:57 <TheLoneWanderer[> well that's awkward
17:57:22 <TheLoneWanderer[> Thanks
17:58:54 <dar_gomml[m]> <strcat[m] "dar_gomml: so we could further e"> when reading "reliable" most people will think their hardware is qualified because it usually works the way they want it to. in connection with fastboot stuff the meaning of the word reliability is much more than that and may surprise people.
18:08:32 <MIKE140> hello i followed the install tutorial but flash-all.sh is stuck since 10 minutes..i see it spawned the "fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-sunfish-s5-0.3-6835615.img" command but is not doing anything..what to do? pixel 4a and ubuntu
18:08:57 <MIKE140> phone screen is on the bootloader black screen that says unlocked in red..didnt flash or anything
18:10:48 <MIKE140> no output on terminal...just the cursor waiting for flash-all.sh to exit
18:10:59 <mrxx_0[m]> MIKE140: You follow the tutorial here : https://grapheneos.org/install ?
18:11:09 <mrxx_0[m]> What USB cable do you have ?
18:12:43 <MIKE191> sorry i got disconnects
18:12:55 <MIKE191> im mike 140 with the issue on flashing
18:13:41 <banjo[m]> perhaps you could try another usb port. on my laptop one of the ports happens to be moody sometimes.
18:14:00 <mrxx_0[m]> Yes MIKE191 try another usb port
18:14:13 <MIKE191> but should i interrupt/stop the flash-all.sh process? im afraid it will brick the device
18:14:46 <MIKE191> i see on gnome system monitor that fastboot flash bootloader command is running (and is stuck i think)
18:18:17 <banjo[m]> wait a bit more
18:22:31 <MIKE191> is over 30 minutes now
18:23:02 <MIKE191> fastboot shows 0 cpu time status uninterrupible on
18:24:43 <strcat> MIKE191: it's safe to stop it
18:24:51 <strcat> MIKE191: and since you're cancelling it you need to restart the device
18:24:57 <strcat> that's expected
18:25:03 <strcat> MIKE191: read the advice in the guide on USB
18:27:27 <MIKE191> ok
18:28:20 <initsuj> Hello. I was attempting to install sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03 on my pixel 4a. Following the directions at https://grapheneos.org/install, I made it to the ./flash-all.bat step. It shows that it completed the "Writing 'bootloader_b' step and tried 'Rebooting into bootloader', but the phone is just black. After 30 minutes, I cancelled the script
18:28:20 <initsuj> execution. I get a notification in windows when connecting/disconnecting the phone, but no activity on the phone display and fastboot doesn't detect it. Is this a known issue or has it been bricked?
18:30:58 <joe93> I'm attempting to install sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03 on my pixel 4a and running into an issue obtaining the "verified" result when running "signify -Cqp factory.pub -..."
18:32:25 <joe93> Instead of "verified," I get "-bash: signify: command not found". I got an "untrusted" result when I entered the public key
18:37:12 <bentley> initsuj: is it a 4a or a 4a 5g?
18:38:32 <initsuj> 4a 5g
18:39:02 <bentley> yeah they are completely different phones
18:39:18 <bentley> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
18:39:19 <bentley> "The Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 aren't currently supported. The Pixel 4a 5G is poorly named and isn't really a variant of the Pixel 4a. It shares more in common with the Pixel 5 and our existing Pixel 4a support isn't relevant to it.
18:39:23 <bentley> "
18:39:30 <initsuj> no possibility of recovery at this point?
18:39:39 <bentley> i don't know. someone else might
18:40:12 <initsuj> Thank you. I should have read further, obviously.
18:40:16 <take_a_deep_brea> initsuj:  you could test 4a 5g builds
18:40:17 <bentley> joe93: that's a sign you didn't follow the install guide correctly
18:40:20 <bentley> https://grapheneos.org/install
18:40:45 <bentley> if you're using another guide, or a video, don't. use the official guide
18:41:19 <initsuj> I would love to test a 5g build if the fact that fastboot no longer detects the phone is not a barrier to entry.
18:41:31 <MIKE191> i tried it again, doublechecked everything but is still hangining on the fastboot flash bootloader step
18:41:39 <joe93> bentley I am following the official guide carefully
18:41:57 <bentley> how did you install signify?
18:42:20 <MIKE191> should the flash-all.sh output something to the terminal, also should fastboot take this much (up to 30 minutes)? on ubuntu with 16g of ram and 8 cores
18:42:40 <joe93> signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip.sig && echo verified
18:43:08 <bentley> that doesn't install signify, that runs signify once it's already been installed
18:43:11 <bentley> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-signify
18:45:23 <MIKE191> or maybe the flash-all.sh needs to be run with sudo? thanks
18:46:08 <MIKE138> i got disconnects im the same mike with pixel 4a issues (fastboot flash bootloader stuck)
18:46:22 <mrxx_0[m]> MIKE138: Did you try using another port ?
18:46:50 <MIKE138> another usb port? yes i got two and the behave the same..cable is brand new paid 15eur
18:47:11 <strcat> MIKE138: issue may be the cable
18:47:27 <mrxx_0[m]> initsuj: pixel 4a 5g is not the same as pixel 4a they are completly different
18:47:39 <MIKE138> fastboot devices does show the pixel4a connected (is not the 5g version)
18:47:55 <strcat> initsuj: we don't have releases for the 4a 5G - you really shouldn't use the 4a releases with it
18:48:02 <strcat> initsuj: you may have to return the device as broken
18:48:15 <mrxx_0[m]> MIKE138: But it looks like your cable can't handle the flow of data the install process needs
18:48:21 <strcat> we're considering adding a check to the flashing script to prevent trying to flash the wrong images
18:48:30 <strcat> it appears the 4a 5G doesn't prevent people from bricking it by doing that...
18:48:46 <MIKE138> is a "power and data cable" usb a to usb c 2.0
18:49:12 <strcat> yeah the issue is probably that cable
18:49:22 <initsuj> @strcat That is about what I figured. Thanks.
18:49:46 <MIKE138> how can i know if is the cable? seems weird
18:50:17 <mrxx_0[m]> It's a known issue, 3rd parties cable are not that good as they pretend
18:50:48 <MIKE138> i have the original cable from google but is usb c only and i cant connect it to the laptop so i got one from the store
18:51:27 <strcat> lots of USB cables are not to spec / low quality
18:51:29 <MIKE138> is better to get an adapter usb c -> usb a? so i can use the original cable?
18:51:33 <strcat> the fact that it's presented as USB 2.0 is suspicious
18:51:57 <strcat> MIKE138: get a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable
18:52:03 <strcat> I would return the one you got
18:52:11 <strcat> and try to get a high quality one from a company like Anker
18:52:15 <MIKE138> is the most expensive ive found in the store (unieuro)
18:52:25 <MIKE138> not sure what to do now
18:52:26 <strcat> but it's USB 2.0
18:52:31 <strcat> which indicates it's cheap
18:52:34 <strcat> since that's an old standard
18:52:53 <bentley> is it a usb 2.0 port maybe?
18:52:55 <strcat> well, also worth keeping in mind that I mean high quality, not 'expensive' per se
18:52:55 <MIKE138> i just noticed it says 2015 on the box
18:53:02 <MIKE138> so is to old i guess is right
18:53:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat "but it's USB 2.0"> might be a developing country
18:53:11 <strcat> MIKE138: I would return the cable
18:53:21 <strcat> MIKE138: try to get a better one
18:53:22 <Albakham[m]> Is it possible to receive sms in not-admin profiles?
18:53:29 <MIKE138> ok will get a newer one..got a recomendation?
18:53:42 <bentley> Albakham[m]: you can toggle calls/sms when managing profiles from the admin profile
18:53:47 <strcat> MIKE138: I recommend a current gen Anker one as a good default - not that Anker is particularly good, but I know they make working cables
18:53:57 <strcat> Anker is somewhat overpriced but... it works
18:54:08 <strcat> and that's more than what can be said for most USB cables
18:54:10 <strcat> which cut corners
18:54:23 <strcat> MIKE138: I think what you have is just an old cable (as you said, from 2015) which wasn't spec compliant
18:54:32 <strcat> MIKE138: early USB-C cables/adaptors were particularly bad
18:54:45 <strcat> MIKE138: maybe it was expensive because they are running out of them as opposed to it being good
18:55:05 <MIKE138> will get one from amazon then..do you know one that surely works? thanks
18:55:27 <mrxx_0[m]> MIKE138: as suggested : Anker
18:55:35 <strcat> MIKE138: any first party anker usb-a to usb-c should be fine
18:55:53 <strcat> I could try to come up with some other brands that are fine
18:56:27 <MIKE138> like this one? is in italian the page sorry https://www.amazon.it/dp/B01M3NB6FB/
18:57:12 <strcat[m]> MIKE138: yeah that should be fine
18:59:28 <MIKE138> thanks
19:00:08 <MIKE138> does trying to flash-all.sh with a bad cable (like im doing) damage the phone? or is ok to flash it again with the new cable when is delivered?
19:04:09 <larncat[m]> Hello, I'm having trouble with location on web sites like openstreetmap.org using Vanadium. I get a general location but can't get a precise one despite giving permission. Apps work fine and I have a GPS lock.
19:04:09 <larncat[m]> Am I missing something?
19:12:42 <larncat[m]> This is probably a feature. 😁
19:14:15 <larncat[m]> There's 1 use case where the web app is broken by this.  maps.google.com just spins endlessly on 'show location'
19:14:16 <strcat[m]> larncat: did you allow Vanadium to access location, and you enabled location in the OS?
19:14:22 <strcat[m]> use SatStat to see if you're getting a GPS lock
19:14:55 <strcat[m]> mentioned on the other channel that we don't have a supplementary location service so you need an actual GPS lock
19:14:56 <strcat[m]> which can take some time
19:14:58 <strcat[m]> and may not work inside
19:17:46 <larncat[m]> strcat yes, I allowed location in Vanadium and enabled in system. SatStat gives a lock.
19:19:11 <larncat[m]> Tried on a clean installation and same result. So far I've tried Bromite which has same behavior. I'll test some more browsers.
19:23:22 <shardiame[m]> How strong is the isolation between two user profiles on GrapheneOS? Is mixing two identities on the same device just a bad idea, or a completely and utterly reprehensible idea?
19:23:37 <strcat> there isn't shared data or communication between apps across profiles
19:23:42 <strcat> but they share a network connection
19:23:56 <strcat> the active profile is in charge of the network connection
19:24:01 <strcat> if other profiles are still active, they'll use it
19:24:15 <strcat> you can make sure to end your sessions in other profiles
19:24:17 <strcat> before switching
19:24:31 <strcat> atm there isn't a way to set profiles as not being able to run in the background but we could add a toggle
19:24:45 <strcat> shardiame[m]: profiles are isolated workspaces
19:24:52 <strcat> it's reasonable to use them as such, that's the point of them
19:25:05 <strcat> shardiame[m]: just keep in mind that by default they will run in the background
19:25:15 <strcat> shardiame[m]: and that the active profile is in charge of setting up networking
19:25:28 <strcat> because the VPN is for the OS as a whole, not just a profile
19:25:53 <strcat> you can use 'end session' before switching though
19:32:46 <shardiame[m]> Hmmm.  That sounds risky then.
19:33:35 <shardiame[m]> Thanks for that though.  That helps!
19:34:58 <larncat[m]> strcat Firefox works with precise location. It asked more permission inside the browser (twice). This solves my outlier use case.
19:34:58 <larncat[m]> I actually prefer Vanadium's behavior in every day usage. Bromite and csagan's Chromium build match Vanadium's behavior. It would be useful to give fine location permission on a per-site basis.
19:35:42 <strcat> larncat[m]: you should be able to enable GPS
19:36:02 <strcat> larncat[m]: there might be an issue stopping Chromium's location support from working properly atm
19:37:19 <larncat[m]> strcat gotcha, thank you. I'll keep an eye on this.
19:39:09 <strcat[m]> larncat: I'd recommend contacting Bromite's developer and talking to him - he probably knows more
19:39:17 <strcat[m]> it might not work properly without Play services location service atm
19:39:21 <strcat[m]> just based on implementation issues
19:40:51 <larncat[m]> strcat Roger, will do. Firefox was from Aurora store.
20:18:01 <MIKE138> does trying to flash-all.sh with a bad cable (like im doing) damage the phone? or is ok to flash it again with the new cable when is delivered?
20:25:31 <AtlasShagged> Does anyone know if  google navigation and android auto work on GrapheneOS? Or is this a google play services buzzkill?
20:27:38 <banjo[m]> AtlasShagged: google maps lite app works
20:28:57 <banjo[m]> * AtlasShagged: google maps go works
20:31:08 <banjo[m]> *  google maps go works
20:32:22 <AtlasShagged> Thanks - Julien seems to love it https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.mapslite&hl=en_US&gl=US
22:38:24 <Ron99> having problems flashing. Pixel 4a bootloader is unlocked but flash-all not working. I'm using a non-oem cable because my laptop does not have usb-c. Is this the problem?
22:48:55 <deappledapple> Perhaps, if you have tried plugging it to other usb ports and still not working
22:53:18 <r0tt0r[m]> also running the flash all does not show anything in general. therefor i recommend.proceeding manual way of.flashing. i had issues coming from some custom rom back to stock google and had to replug usb when entering fastboot it recognized. was quiet weird issue but after stock was back all was working as usual

23:00:37 <deappledapple> <r0tt0r[m] "also running the flash all does "> Wdym? It does show stuffs normally
23:08:26 <r0tt0r[m]> <deappledapple "Wdym? It does show stuffs normal"> i referred to the flash.sh from stock. i sit there half an hour for recognizing it didnt do anything because fastboot didnt show connect, after replug it started till next reboot and sit there again. therefor i do steps manually.

23:25:59 <Sam94> Hi, I'm excited to have grapheneOS running on my new pixel 4a. Is there a list of what apps will run on graphene without microG?  Like will Signal app run? or the protonmail app?
23:27:14 <TheJollyRoger> Sam94: Signal will run. Go and sideload it from https://signal.org/android/apk . GrapheneOS will run most apps that don't have a hard dependency on GSF.
23:28:26 <snooopy> Sam94: a lot of apps from the f-droid repo don't need GSF
23:31:12 <deappledapple> <Sam94 "Hi, I'm excited to have graphene"> Quick answer, ProtonMail will run, but no notifications
23:35:53 <catfish[m]> If anyone wants to play with Briar here's my link briar://aany5bslsqdbhgtzmtwvq3xxj2u4d55urvvr6omh2jxe6tk6ctqwe
23:35:53 <catfish[m]> Heads up connecting over the internet took 4 hours with one of my buddies! The website says wait 48 hours 😂 anyway it would be nice to try with more people
23:52:20 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> I love the concept of Briar. However the path to mass adoption seems extremely long
23:53:36 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> We live in a world where most people think Telegram and WhatsApp are secure and private
23:54:04 <louipx>  catfish[m] u29601mg6ba93j[m please join #grapheneos-offtopic for more general chat about tech and stuff
