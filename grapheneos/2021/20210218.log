00:09:58 <zvl12[m]> "GSF dependent" on Aurora Store means app will not work on GOS ? Looking to see if some bank apps will function.
00:11:19 <ab2919392> cheers mate
00:11:54 <ab2919392> anyone here going to CrikyCon australia this year?
00:47:06 <gosinstall> when installing GOS on my 4a, it hangs at the "fastbootd" interface on the device after flashing the avb keys - is this normal?
00:48:21 <gosinstall> when using the web install I get this error: "Error: The requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired."
01:05:37 <HomeWIre> someone get Failed to boot into userspace fastboot message?

01:21:00 <b1101> is that the last line where it gets stuck?
01:21:16 <HomeWIre> yes
01:22:24 <b1101> could be the port or cable.
01:23:16 <HomeWIre> ok thats probably i was thinking off.. thanks for the advice ill try other cable + port
01:23:41 <HomeWIre> and sorry again for this paste..
01:24:29 <b1101> np. also windows 10? drivers installed with windows update I'm guessing
01:24:34 <HomeWIre> no
01:24:43 <HomeWIre> i donwloaded the driver from google
01:24:47 <b1101> even better
01:24:51 <b1101> than ya, try the cable
01:24:54 <b1101> and port
01:25:19 <HomeWIre> thank you for you help! going to try this and come back later
01:25:31 <b1101> I mean you can idle for a bit :/
01:36:00 <case_[m]> Hey, I'm thinking of buying a pixel 3 and install grapheneos, is there anyone who has it and can share the experience? Is it easy to install? Is the phone good? Thanks in advance
01:36:31 <rny> Get the latest device.
01:37:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> The latest you can reasonably afford.
01:37:24 <b1101> ^
01:37:55 <b1101> I'm on p3. while I love it, I know support will end at the end of the year, so I'm looking for at getting a p5 when the price drops
01:43:46 <case_[m]> Yeah pixels are expensive for what they are packing imo that's why I'm aiming at the P3
01:44:42 <case_[m]> Only going for them for the ease to use grapheneos or other degoogled rom
01:44:47 <b1101> they drop in price when the new models release
01:47:51 <warmjuice[m]> Buying a phone with 2 years of support left is 💩
01:48:47 <hypokeimenon[m]> There were some okay deals on the latest Pixels last year. Nothing spectacular.
02:04:08 <b1101> I really hope prices drop by at least $100 on p5 when new ones are announced/released
02:07:02 <case_[m]> Yeah, but still a bit expensive
02:07:43 <case_[m]> Brand new phones 700/800 usd, 3y support
02:08:44 <case_[m]> That's the price of a laptop, that will have all the support one needs
02:08:48 <zzxx123> It’s actually more expensive to buy a last gen P5 at 100 discount. Consider that fact that it has a year less of support. Pixel 5’s MSRP is 700 USD. Here a simple math: 700/36=19.4/month; 600/24=25/month.
02:12:45 <b1101> I mean I could get it for under $600 on ebay now
02:13:09 <grapheneos_user_> <zzxx123 "It’s actually more expensive to "> Except there is also the used market in which prices drop by at least $200, usually more simply for being used.
02:14:05 <grapheneos_user_> If you find one that has a scratched back but nothing on the screen, you just put a case on it and it is like new
02:14:09 <zzxx123> b1101  logic is if you wait a year just to save $100 is not worth it.
02:14:16 <grapheneos_user_> But much lower price
02:15:03 <b1101> yup.
02:17:25 <zzxx123> grapheneos_user_  go away, your argument missing the whole point
02:20:36 <b1101> anyone know the pixel 5 sku I want. there is GA01316-us or GD1YQ; which supports mmwave from what I've read
02:21:38 <b1101> or are those the same thing :/
02:23:01 <elvis1cat[m]> With the 5 not officially supported, how difficult is it to install GrapheneOS?
02:23:39 <b1101> elvis1cat[m]: the builds area already up. it'll work minus maybe some bugs from what I've read
02:24:50 <elvis1cat[m]> sorry must've missed that
02:26:05 <elvis1cat[m]> I have a 4a installed and working, but I miss the larger screen.  Waiting for the 4XL prices to drop... $1000 is way to high
02:28:29 <grapheneos_user_> <zzxx123 "grapheneos_user_pi  go away, you"> Dafuq? You said it would be more expensive to buy last gen, I said it would actually be less expensive even considering support.
02:31:42 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "Dafuq? You said it would be more"> Not sure how that misses the whole point.
02:36:36 <grapheneos_user_> * Dafuq? You said it would be more expensive to buy last gen, I said it would actually be less expensive even considering support, when you account for the used market.
03:53:23 <b1101> found someone on ebay with the p5 that's local. asked if they would be willing to sell it directly at discount. hopefully :)
04:01:09 <b1101> also found out that when you get tmobile prepaid, and use either cards or ebay sellers that directly refill, the cost is exactly what's shown. not sure if that's how tmobile does it, but I was happy when it was $15 flat without fees.
04:23:58 <jlwtformer[m]> Tmobile will also lock your bootloader for up to 45 days. Source: me
04:24:52 <b1101> jlwtformer[m]: you mean if you buy the phone directly?
04:25:06 <b1101> err. from them*
04:29:29 <rny> jlwtformer[m]: do they eventually unlock and how?
04:31:07 <jlwtformer[m]> Yes if you buy from them. You can after 45 days if you do a sim unlock. I have had my 4a 5G for a few months now, haven't had time to try.
04:49:23 <zzxx123> so they do modem and bl unlock at once?
04:50:07 <jlwtformer[m]> I think? I haven't read too far into it.
04:52:02 <zzxx123> tell them you are traveling out of the country, they will unlock immediately
04:52:39 <zzxx123> I've tried this with att and tmo both worked
06:26:29 <jojo30> Hi
06:26:41 <take_a_deep_brea> hello
06:28:53 <jojo30> I know this has been asked numerous times, but I can't seem to find an answer for it... or figure it out.
06:28:54 <jojo30> I am trying to install grapheneOS on a pixel 4a.
06:28:54 <jojo30> However, when I get to the part where I am using the flash-all.bat (using it in CMD), I get the prompt of "fastboot too old"
06:28:55 <jojo30> I have verified the version of fastboot being the newest from google 30.0.5
06:28:55 <jojo30> In I've moved all the files into the current directly to be in the same "shell" or environment
06:29:11 <jojo30> I'm using windows 10 ** sorry forgot to clarify that
06:30:19 <jojo30> I'm using a standalone, so there is no install... there is no previous install versions on my computer
06:33:29 <sphinxcat[m]> jojo30: you are not supposed to use cmd or manually move files. Follow the official instructions: https://grapheneos.org/install/
06:33:58 <jojo30> I followed that guide, and no dice
06:34:35 <jojo30> i used the CLI install
06:35:32 <nscnt[m]> You didn't. Using the legacy CMD causes this error. You should use PowerShell. Started from the "Start Menu". No files need to be moved.
06:36:04 <jojo30> okay let me read through it again
06:45:36 <jojo30> thank you nscnt, that was the problem. Sorry I missed the powershell. I used legacy command prompt for flashing my pixel 2 to original ROM before and figured it would be the same well.
06:49:53 <jojo30> Thanks again. Good Night.
06:50:38 <strcat[m]> issue above is they were using command prompt so they weren't setting up PATH (since it's done differently there)
06:50:56 <strcat[m]> and they have an out-of-date fastboot globally installed, probably from following one of the inaccurate third party guides in the past
06:51:01 <strcat[m]> which recommend installing third party tools
06:51:10 <strcat[m]> otherwise the fastboot they had globally would likely be up-to-date enough
06:53:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just use arch
06:53:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Literally has a package to install exactly the same adb as the platform tools has in the aur
06:54:36 <take_a_deep_brea> true , but then you will have to then guide them through installing arch , lol
07:20:34 <strcat[m]> or rather just use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
07:20:48 <strcat[m]> don't really understand why people unfamiliar with CLI are still trying to do the CLI install and then getting entirely stuck
07:22:20 <take_a_deep_brea> i think the issue is that people tend to skip lines/paragraphs  in the CLI installation thinking they have it all figured out . so for ex. the guy who just left most likely a CMD window before even reading the guide
07:22:48 <take_a_deep_brea>  * i think the issue is that people tend to skip lines/paragraphs  in the CLI installation thinking they have it all figured out . so for ex. the person who just had this issue most likely opened a CMD window before even reading the guide
10:36:36 <nix465[m]> does anyone use banking apps on their grapheneOS device ?
10:37:17 <nix465[m]> I typically just use online banking or just go into the bank itself to sort stuff out but just curious as most banking apps are closed source
10:38:30 <take_a_deep_brea> nix465:  please continue this discussion in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  as apps are off-topic  for this room
10:38:42 <nix465[m]> ahh okay sorry about that
10:39:06 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem
10:39:31 <nix465[m]> my pixel 4a is coming today excited to get graphene installed and setup :D
10:56:48 <DFuchsiaOS_when> Nice
10:57:17 <Device_Manager[m> <nix465[m] "my pixel 4a is coming today exci"> Its much easier then everyone is making it out to be, follow the web installer for a hassle 0-free install...
10:57:35 <Device_Manager[m> * Its much easier then everyone is making it out to be, follow the web installer for a hassle-free install...
10:59:46 <nix465[m]> <Device_Manager[m "Its much easier then everyone is"> ahh dont worry about that :) Id like to verify the image before install so will use the CLI
11:00:07 <nix465[m]> but have experience installing android ROMs before (mainly lineageOS)
11:12:25 <strcat[m]> nix465: it's easy to use the CLI install as long as you have CLI experience and can accurately follow the instructions without deviating at all
11:12:38 <strcat[m]> nix465: but for anyone without CLI experience, etc. we recommend the web install
11:14:44 <strcat[m]> also, it'd be pretty helpful if the community spread the word about the web installer
11:14:54 <strcat[m]> we need a lot of links to it from all over
11:15:00 <strcat[m]> it needs to rank above everything else in searches
11:15:21 <strcat[m]> we need people finding that, not sketchy third party videos using a messed up broken approach to CLI install not based on our official guide
11:16:28 <Device_Manager[m> <nix465[m] "ahh dont worry about that :) Id "> I meant to say its not as hard as every1 us making it out to be, havent had any issues besides being remotely accessed, definitely viewing, cannot tell whether they have control....yet.  Do the Devs kno if Ghost Framewprk was patched yet?  If so what or where are other possiblities?
11:18:13 <nscnt[m]> Wrong room
11:20:24 <nscnt[m]> Already feels like it'll turn into some FUD
11:21:04 <strcat[m]> it already is
11:21:51 <Device_Manager[m> I waa not on stock long enough for them to gain shyt, but it seems after 4 days or so, device off most of the time, for device tio    become comprimiseded.  I dont know where or how, the more i am able to jump ROMs, the clock starts over.
11:22:08 <strcat[m]> ADB existing is not an exploit
11:22:14 <strcat[m]> it is not something to be patched
11:22:18 <strcat[m]> it is functionality that's available
11:23:06 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: I doubt you are being compromised, and if you were, then the most likely scenario is that the device you are using to install the OS was compromised and you didn't actually install what you think
11:23:30 <strcat[m]> but, even that is pretty unlikely
11:23:37 <strcat[m]> do /join #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org and talk about it there
11:24:00 <strcat[m]> don't think it's a good topic for this channel especially since it primarily doesn't seem to be about GrapheneOS

11:49:49 <Device_Manager[m> Sorry I don't know what's going on with this goddamn talk-to-text
11:50:33 <somenerd[m]> Go to offtopic
11:50:38 <somenerd[m]> Please
11:51:04 <Device_Manager[m> <strcat[m] "we recommend having ADB disabled"> What are you speakin of and adb is off
11:51:21 <Device_Manager[m> BLs lockes'd
11:51:33 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: you're talking about 'ghost framework' which is tooling based around ADB for controlling a device
11:51:56 <strcat[m]> ADB can be configured to listen on a port, if ADB is disabled, then that isn't relevant
11:51:58 <somenerd[m]> At this point, don’t think they know what they’re saying
11:52:13 <strcat[m]> and ADB cannot be configured to listen on a port with at minimum having ADB access already
11:52:20 <Device_Manager[m> <strcat[m] "Device_Manager: you're talking a"> Okay I was just making sure like we were on the same page that's all is there anything else that you know of that can access I'm not an amateur so please don't treat me in that fashion take that out of context either
11:52:42 <strcat[m]> use Auditor to verify the device
11:52:51 <Device_Manager[m> I know the basics to know with the love for I didn't download or click anything I shouldn't click you know those are my apps make sure everything that there should be
11:53:11 <strcat[m]> okay so what makes you think you are compromised in the first place?
11:53:12 <somenerd[m]> How do you know that it’s compromised?
11:55:30 <somenerd[m]> ???
11:55:52 <Device_Manager[m> <somenerd[m] "How do you know that it’s compro"> Chinese secret if i told ya...
11:56:23 <strcat[m]> so, if you don't want to talk about it here, best to switch to another topic then?
11:59:58 <somenerd[m]> I guess so?
12:00:38 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: you're welcome to explain why you think your device is compromised
12:00:49 <strcat[m]> but if you are going to talk about a house, etc. then please #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
12:26:18 <nix465[m]> <strcat[m] "also, it'd be pretty helpful if "> yeah ill be doing it cli now, just updating the phone :), I may have convinced my friend who has a pixel 4a to switch to grapheneOS as he wants to become more privacy oriented
12:35:23 <nix465[m]> what is the equivalent android-udev package for fedora ?
12:36:15 <take_a_deep_brea> nix465:  why dont you try https://pkgs.org
12:37:04 <nscnt[m]> nix465: Fedora has bad packaging
12:37:22 <nscnt[m]> udev is non-existent iirc
12:37:33 <nscnt[m]> as a package
12:37:59 <strcat[m]> nix465: the upstream project is https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules or you can make a simple little 5 line config yourself
12:38:10 <nix465[m]> ahh should I not use fedora for installation ?
12:38:38 <nix465[m]> I have a windows machine I could use, what would you suggest ?
12:38:52 <take_a_deep_brea> better use arch linux
12:39:09 <take_a_deep_brea> or sorry windows is better if you are not big on signature verfication
12:39:26 <nscnt[m]> It just doesn't make sense with Fedora's awful packaging
12:39:36 <take_a_deep_brea> as it will take you half an hour minimum to set up arch
12:39:49 <nscnt[m]> I would go for Windows 10 and WebUSB-based installation
12:39:53 <strcat[m]> there's no point in installing another OS to install GrapheneOS
12:39:59 <strcat[m]> use web installer on Windows
12:40:14 <strcat[m]> it only makes sense to use CLI install if you're on an OS with proper packages for it
12:40:16 <blacklight447[m]> I trust fedora a heck of a lot more then most other big distros
12:40:20 <blacklight447[m]> Much more then say debian
12:40:45 <take_a_deep_brea> blacklight447:  kinda of-topic dont you think ?
12:40:54 <strcat[m]> it's easiest to install GrapheneOS via web install on macOS
12:41:08 <strcat[m]> no issues there
12:41:34 <strcat[m]> linux distributions have the udev security theater and USB issues
12:41:35 <take_a_deep_brea> let me guess : good usb-c so less chances of hw problem ?
12:41:51 <strcat[m]> Windows needs a fastboot USB driver which is an annoyance
12:42:20 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: no need for special driver (has a generic one like the Linux kernel) and high quality USB-C ports, and no driver issues with USB, etc.
12:42:39 <take_a_deep_brea> niice
12:43:05 <strcat[m]> main issue with Windows is needing a special driver
12:43:11 <strcat[m]> for many people, it automatically installs the driver
12:43:13 <strcat[m]> so it just works
12:43:28 <strcat[m]> but a lot of people for some reason need to manually install it via Windows Update optional updates
12:43:47 <strcat[m]> and it has an issue where it chooses some random vendor variation of the fastboot driver (which works, but is odd)
12:44:04 <strcat[m]> anyway other than that + hardware issues it works
12:44:43 <strcat[m]> linux distributions have the udev security theater nonsense (which actually reduces security in reality due to the results of it) and issues with USB beyond just in hardware
12:45:08 <strcat[m]> so, yeah, on a distribution with proper packaging like arch linux on proper hardware that's properly supported by the linux kernel
12:45:24 <strcat[m]> it's easy, and you can do CLI install with the distro fastboot + signify packages
12:45:38 <strcat[m]> and verify the release with signify, and you don't need any non-distro-packaged software
12:46:23 <strcat[m]> and needing the android-udev package in order to use the device is pretty silly regardless of it being easy to install
12:47:02 <strcat[m]> a local user at a physical session has access to the USB devices... tagging them uaccess should be the default, not something that you need special rules to set up which hard-wire the vendor ids of each kind of usb device
12:47:17 <strcat[m]> look at what that android udev package actually does
12:47:17 <somenerd[m]> Maybe it’ll be easiest (and most secure if it’s implemented as an app and has sig verification) to instal GrapheneOS from GrapheneOS lol
12:47:20 <strcat[m]> it's stupid as hell
12:47:30 <strcat[m]> it hard-wires a big database of vendor ids of fastboot devices
12:47:44 <strcat[m]> to tag them uaccess (and set them as owned by a group, but you only need the group for remote access)
12:47:59 <strcat[m]> USB devices should just be tagged uaccess by default... really
12:48:21 <strcat[m]> it's the usual issue of traditional distributions having no real security model and confusing security theater + painful nonsense with security
12:48:28 <nix465[m]> im gonna have to use windows 10 in this case, it says I need to install a driver for fastboot from the optional driver updates, do you guys know what I need to do for this or which optional update is required
12:48:37 <strcat[m]> Android and ChromeOS: a local user can use USB devices, but has to authorize apps to access them
12:49:11 <strcat[m]> desktop Linux: a local user cannot use most USB devices by default, but rather needs to use root access to set up rules hard-wiring vendor ids to make them usable, and then every application can access them without the user granting any permission since there's no security model
12:50:07 <strcat[m]> nix465: it calls it 'bootloader interface' with a random vendor name
12:50:21 <strcat[m]> nix465: you have to connect the device in bootloader interface mode and then check for updates and it shows up
12:50:30 <strcat[m]> nix465: in many cases, it will automatically install the driver
12:50:45 <strcat[m]> nix465: we have to include those instructions for people who for some reason don't get the driver automatically for reasons unclear to us
12:50:51 <nix465[m]> ahh okay so I connect my phone to windows and then check for optional driver updates
12:50:58 <nix465[m]> in case it comes up in there
12:51:00 <strcat[m]> nix465: do it exactly as it says in the guide
12:51:09 <strcat[m]> you don't just connect it without it being in the proper mode
12:51:22 <strcat[m]> it won't show up if you just connect it booted into the OS
12:51:35 <nix465[m]> oh yeah I understand that, boot into the bootloader interface and then connect
12:51:54 <strcat[m]> I'd say there is a 50% chance you do not need to install the driver manually
12:52:02 <strcat[m]> just Windows things
12:52:03 <strcat[m]> shrug
12:52:31 <nscnt[m]> there's /shrug btw
12:52:36 <nscnt[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
12:52:53 <strcat[m]> shrug is superior except that Matrix is really dumb and removes the asterisks when sending it over to IRC via the bridge
12:53:03 <strcat> *shrug* is what I am typing
12:53:30 <strcat> dunno why it doesn't pass through markdown formatting when the whole point of markdown was that it copies the syntax people use informally on IRC and in plain text email
12:53:58 <somenerd[m]> Also /shrug is inconsistent sometimes
12:54:02 <strcat> (with the additional of a really bad syntax for marking up URLs which ignores that ( and ) are valid characters in URLs and that you're supposed to use < and >)
12:54:05 <somenerd[m]> /shrug
12:54:20 <somenerd[m]> Did it work? Well I sure can’t tell
12:54:29 <nscnt[m]> It just says "/shrug"
12:54:34 <somenerd[m]> Looks like it didn’t
12:54:35 <somenerd[m]> Yeah
12:54:46 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
12:55:00 <nscnt[m]> Did it work for me earlier? (^-^°)
12:55:58 <somenerd[m]> it did
12:56:51 <strcat> irc can do cool things too
12:57:07 <nscnt[m]> wew
12:57:17 * nscnt[m] sends confetti 🎉
12:57:25 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
12:58:14 <somenerd[m]> well, matrix can too... thing is that for every time it works, it also breaks
12:58:57 <strcat[m]> you know irc must be good because when you join freenode they port scan you and probe your client for vulnerabilities
12:59:11 <somenerd[m]> What lol
12:59:23 <strcat> they don't allow you to join if you have a known vulnerable client / compromised machine
13:00:07 <strcat> 05:22:52 freenode  -- | freenode-connect (frigg@freenode/utility-bot/frigg): Welcome to freenode. To protect the network all new connections will be scanned for vulnerabilities.
13:00:08 <strcat>                       | This will not harm your computer, and vulnerable hosts will be notified.
13:00:31 <somenerd[m]> Cool
13:00:37 <somenerd[m]> Matrix does no such thing lol
13:00:54 <somenerd[m]> It’s an e2ee IRC replacement for non technical people
13:00:57 <strcat> it's because if say, irssi has a vulnerability, it is a pretty big issue if ppl can be mass exploited
13:01:00 <strcat> and then used to spam freenode, etc.
13:01:26 <somenerd[m]> which is buggy (matrix)
13:01:28 <strcat> matrix servers *could* do that
13:01:40 <strcat> i.e. forcing you to upgrade clients (if it has a way to see the client name + ver at least)
13:02:49 <somenerd[m]> I mean, people usually use the WebUI
13:03:01 <somenerd[m]> Which is sorta up to date
13:03:11 <somenerd[m]> But maybe it can see the browser?
13:04:11 <brace_> strcat: freenode does not probe you for that kind of vulnerabilities
13:04:58 <brace_> by "vulnerabilities" they mean proxies
13:05:31 <strcat[m]> brace_: they do ban old clients though
13:07:50 <strcat> lol matrix
13:07:59 <brace_> strcat: really? I'm able to connect with an irssi version from 2001 without any issues
13:08:32 <brace_> I've only seen the frigg version check used against spambots
13:09:44 <strcat[m]> brace_: they might not care about such old versions vs. certain newer ones with vulnerabilities found, afaik they do check in some cases
13:14:13 <brace_> the widely exploited bitchx version seems to work fine too, as does a vulnerable xchat version
13:14:39 <brace_> all the recent irc client bugs I can think of were really annoying to exploit
13:15:57 <strcat[m]> brace_: I don't think they do it all the time, but rather when news of one comes out
13:16:17 <strcat[m]> as a temporary thing
13:16:52 <brace_> Maybe, never seen it. They've been doing network-wide notifications about such in the past though
13:18:33 <nix465[m]> do I need to boot into the bootloader interface before connecting to my pc ?
13:18:48 <nix465[m]> cant seem to get webusb to recognize it
13:18:58 <strcat[m]> nix465: make sure you have the driver
13:19:00 <nix465[m]> windows is fully up to date/no optional updates
13:19:21 <strcat[m]> does it say no optional updates when phone is connected in bootloader interface mode?
13:19:32 <strcat[m]> you have to run a check for updates
13:19:36 <strcat[m]> after it's connected
13:20:22 <nix465[m]> checking for updates now
13:21:40 <nix465[m]> no updates are there, just checked update history and there is a "LeMobile - other hardware - android bootloader interface"
13:21:43 <nix465[m]> so it is installed
13:25:56 <strcat[m]> nix465: should be working now then
13:26:00 <strcat[m]> nix465: needs to be a browser with WebUSB support
13:26:10 <strcat[m]> Edge works
13:26:31 <nix465[m]> restarted chromium and is working fine now :)
13:27:20 <strcat[m]> nix465: did it install the driver for you automatically btw?
13:27:27 <fast1[m]> Is it possible to use yubikeys to log into websites in vanadium?
13:27:46 <strcat[m]> fast1: not via U2F/FIDO2 yet because the standard implementation is via a Play services library
13:27:48 <strcat[m]> so we need to reimplement it
13:27:59 <strcat[m]> and they don't provide their own library, etc.
13:29:18 <fast1[m]> Does it work for apps like OpenKeycahin? Or do the apps all use the Play Services implementation?
13:29:39 <fast1[m]> I guess that's smartcard stuff so it's different
13:38:06 <strcat[m]> fast1: it's only U2F/FIDO2 library used by certain apps that's not present
13:38:19 <strcat[m]> fast1: the functionality of the hardware is fully supported for apps using it
13:38:32 <strcat[m]> fast1: issue is that Chromium uses it via a library that's not present
13:43:17 <nix465[m]> got it all setup strcat :), just ran auditor, it just says verified device information, is that all I need to do or do I need t compare the boot hashs or something (sorry im not too sure lol)
13:50:26 <strcat[m]> nix465: nah you're done
14:07:14 <nix465[m]> <strcat[m] "nix465: nah you're done"> awesome thanks for your help I appreciate it, just wondering how would I go about transferring music to my device from linux, I have it connected, it comes up as pixel4a, when I click on it its just empty
14:07:37 <nix465[m]> would I just drag the music folder into it or do I have to do something on grapheneOS
14:09:00 <fomijafi[m]> <nix465[m] "would I just drag the music fold"> You have to enable file transfer in the USB Preferences menu
14:09:14 <fomijafi[m]> And then yes, you can drag files over
14:09:21 * Platypus[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZmvuHsUEnasOuATbKrJngmiQ/message.txt >
14:09:55 <nix465[m]> <fomijafi[m] "And then yes, you can drag files"> gone onto usb preferences and its all greyed out
14:12:13 <fomijafi[m]> nix465 what's selected for USB controlled by?
14:16:07 <nix465[m]> <fomijafi[m] "nix465 what's selected for USB c"> its all done now, I reconnected the usb c cable to my pc and it fixed it
14:16:17 <nix465[m]> wasnt picking up my pc for some reason on my device but all working now
14:34:19 <nix465[m]> when I reboot my device I get a warning message stating your device is loading another operating system is this normal ?, ive followed the installer exactly
14:34:43 <nix465[m]> sorry for all the questions btw, first time using graphene :)
14:35:57 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <nix465[m] "when I reboot my device I get a "> That's normal, the yellow warning
14:36:25 <nix465[m]> yeah thats it, thanks
14:55:55 <strcat> nix465[m]: it's part of verified boot when loading a non-stock OS
14:56:08 <strcat> nix465[m]: so, for example, on a device that was built to run GrapheneOS, you would have that when *not* using GrapheneOS
14:56:38 <strcat> it means it's using the verified boot key flashed to the secure element to verify
14:56:42 <strcat> rather than the hard-wired stock OS one
15:01:12 <strcat[m]> i.e. it means verified boot is enabled as opposed to it saying the device is not being verified due to being unlocked
15:01:35 <strcat[m]> it waits for 5s to make sure you see it can double tap power to skip it
15:01:39 <strcat[m]> if you really care
15:03:48 <take_a_deep_brea> dont worry thats just me checking out  tchncs.de
15:04:06 <somenerd[m]> lol k
16:33:54 <konrad[m]> What is the cheapest phone that supports graphene?
16:34:43 <elvis1cat[m]> <konrad[m] "What is the cheapest phone that "> New?  Pixel 4a
16:36:21 <konrad[m]> Thats 500 bucks
16:39:00 <TheJollyRoger> konrad[m]: Which is amortized over the lifespan of the device to the day it becomes EOL.
16:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> That's still two years out.
16:40:38 <konrad[m]> Never ever i amwasting 500 on a phone.
16:41:46 <nscnt[m]> It's not 500 bucks everywhere btw, which is probably the reason why he recommended it. It's 345 € here
16:42:17 <TheJollyRoger> Your choice. Remember that the previous generation phones might look like a bargain, until they become a pop tart when Qualcomm says "Ok, our contract's fulfilled, goodbye" and forces both upstream and us to abandon the handset.
16:42:37 <TheJollyRoger> This will be a matter of months now.
16:43:35 <TheJollyRoger> So don't go thinking of buying a 3 or earlier, because that $350 you spend on a 3 now will be amortized over just ~7 months.
16:43:42 <konrad[m]> 345 is still ridiculous. Thats definitely not the cheapest
16:44:30 <nscnt[m]> It's the cheapest recommended phone
16:44:36 <take_a_deep_brea> konrad:  it is for a pixel 4a
16:44:59 <take_a_deep_brea> i mean maybe you can get one for second hand for lesser
16:45:03 <TheJollyRoger> It's the best value for your money if you want to run GrapheneOS.
16:45:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah - but secondhand, you roll the dice.
16:45:19 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
16:45:27 <nscnt[m]> if you want to run a secure phone in general
16:45:45 <take_a_deep_brea> then you got to pay for the hardware
16:45:54 <TheJollyRoger> You could end up with what you wanted, but more likely you're going to just end up with a bootloader/carrier locked phone that you can not unlock and cannot return.
16:46:04 <take_a_deep_brea> we are lucky to say the least that atleast the software is free lol
16:46:51 <TheJollyRoger> Or worst case, you end up with a phone that's been seller refurbished with substandard parts.
16:47:34 <nscnt[m]> konrad: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
16:48:30 <konrad[m]> Ok i think i got graphene confused with another that also recommended xiaomis
16:48:34 <konrad[m]> Maybe calyx
16:49:49 <TheJollyRoger> At one point it was hoped that the Mi A2 would be the next device that'd support GrapheneOS, but it turned out that its verified boot implementation is broken.
16:50:17 <TheJollyRoger> (Please take note that discussion of non-GrapheneOS operating systems is embargoed in this channel.)
16:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> When other OEMs offer phones for a lower price point than the Pixels, if they're not cheaping out on the obvious like using older processors, less RAM, and less storage, and cheaper cameras, what they generally start cutting is how long they negotiate with Qualcomm for for firmware/device support, and cheaping out on developer time when it comes to firmware/bootloader security.
16:52:47 <TheJollyRoger> Or both, neither of those are mutually exclusive.
16:54:53 <super_noob[m]> Hey folks. Not a tech issue (G is running great!) I've run into my first "ponder" as a result of de-googling. How many of you continue to use google to save your contacts?
16:55:13 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: Glad to hear it's running well for you!
16:55:54 <thetranstocommie> <super_noob[m] "Hey folks. Not a tech issue (G i"> hey, welcome to the light side! i remember exporting my contacts from google contacts, and at that point you can import that file into the stock grapheneos contacts app
16:56:57 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: I just back up my contact list using SeedVault onto a USB drive at night when I leave the phone to charge on a wireless charger at night. Or, you can do what thetranstocommie suggested, and export them to .vcf files, which you can import into any program that supports them (most do), or even open in a text editor if you need to.
16:58:41 <super_noob[m]> <thetranstocommie "hey, welcome to the light side! "> Yes, I was aware that I can export from Google, and import. But does anyone back up anywhere?
17:00:40 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "super_noob: I just back up my co"> .vcf ... got it. That one I didn't know.
17:02:09 <thetranstocommie> <super_noob[m] "Yes, I was aware that I can expo"> seedvault, the built in backup app you can get to in settings>system>backup, can backup your contacts, apps, and more to Nextcloud really simply and easily
17:03:18 <thetranstocommie> i personally just backup to a USB thumb drive, but the option for nextcloud is there.
17:04:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. SeedVault backups are encrypted with a 12-word recovery cryptographic seed, so they're safe to be stored on a server even if you don't trust it.
17:04:26 <TheJollyRoger> Note though, if you export to a .vcf, .vcf files are NOT encrypted! So treat your contact list with care.
17:05:52 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yep. SeedVault backups are encry"> Awesome!! Thank you. This  perfectly addresses my concerns.
17:07:02 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: whatever you do, don't lose that seed. Stow it in a safe place. If you lose the seed and there is no "second chance" or "reset", the data will be lost.
17:08:15 <TheJollyRoger> *if you lose the seed, there is no "second chance"
17:10:17 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "super_noob: whatever you do, don"> 👍️
17:29:40 <nodevicefound> i would like to install Grapheneos on Oneplus 7, can any tell me how to do that and is it working properly with this os ?
17:30:41 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicefound: No, you cannot install GrapheneOS on One Plus 7.
17:30:50 <TheLoneWanderer[> Not supported
17:31:27 <TheJollyRoger> Each device needs to have the operating system ported to it specifically and individually maintained. Unfortunately, the OnePlus 7 does not meet the security requirements for GrapheneOS.
17:31:54 <nodevicefound> thanks for quick response
17:32:52 <nodevicefound> have a nice day ahead
17:33:53 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicefound: Please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support on device support. Your best bet if you would like to run GrapheneOS is to buy a Pixel 4a. That's the best value for the money.
17:53:52 <elvis1cat[m]> <nodevicefound "thanks for quick response"> you can buy a 4a via the Google store at amazon for about $350 USD
18:04:59 <nix465[m]> <strcat[m] "i.e. it means verified boot is e"> Ahh okay cool I understand now cheers
18:05:59 <nix465[m]> I'm loving grapheneOS much more than lineage tbf
18:08:25 <thjrwg2236[m]> Hey, I forgot the login password for my grapheneOS google pixel 3 XL phone. Sadly I have it locked and cant unlock it via the settings as usual. What options do I have? Can I reset it to the normal android 11 again somehow?
18:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> nix465[m]: Welcome aboard the ship!
18:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> thjrwg2236[m]: If you've forgotten the password, there is one way out from this:
18:09:36 <TheJollyRoger> Reset from recovery.
18:09:48 <TheJollyRoger> I will walk you through the process.
18:09:53 <thjrwg2236[m]> Yeah I tried but then GrapheneOS starts again
18:10:11 <TheJollyRoger> I said, I will walk you through the process.
18:10:33 <TheJollyRoger> First off, standard disclaimer applies: I regret to say that I can't save your data at this point, if the password has been lost.
18:10:52 <thjrwg2236[m]> Yeah I dont really care about the data. Thank you!
18:10:56 <TheJollyRoger> So everything onboard that phone will be lost and there is no way we can retrieve it, even if you do somehow find or remember the password at a later date.
18:11:07 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great. First step, I want you to switch the phone off completely.
18:11:23 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to return to recovery using the combo keys.
18:11:54 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know when your phone has shut down. I'm going to go through the same on mine with you so I can keep track, but I'll stop just short of resetting.
18:11:56 <thjrwg2236[m]> Okay done
18:12:10 <TheJollyRoger> So just give me a sec since I need to shut down too.
18:12:54 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, first step, I want you to hold down the volume key, and keeping it held down, press and hold down the power key until you return to fastboot.
18:13:56 <thjrwg2236[m]> Done
18:14:17 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. I want you to use the volume keys to select "Recovery"
18:14:50 <thjrwg2236[m]> Done
18:15:03 <TheJollyRoger> There should be a picture of the Android with its belly open and a !, lying on its back.
18:15:22 <TheJollyRoger> Now, there's a little trick you have to do with the buttons, let me just figure it out for a sec, I forget this part.
18:16:17 <thjrwg2236[m]> On the tutorial I read it was: held power button + volume up, but then grapheneOS just started again
18:16:39 <thjrwg2236[m]>  * On the tutorial I read it was: held power button + volume up, but when i tried it grapheneOS just started again
18:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> thjrwg2236[m]: Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what the combo key was, since I've unfortunately had to do  this before. It does work though, hope is not lost.
18:18:25 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, think I got it, let me just check to confirm.
18:19:32 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I got it, thjrwg2236[m], press power, and quickly tap and immediately release volume up, then a split-second later let go of power.
18:19:40 <TheJollyRoger> You should enter the GrapheneOS recovery menu from there.
18:20:17 <TheJollyRoger> It requires a bit of a trick to do it, the trick is don't hold it for too long or the operating system will boot and you'll need to start over.
18:21:00 <TheJollyRoger> Once you get there you should see the option for a factory reset.
18:21:22 <thjrwg2236[m]> I actually just held the button too long before. Thank you really much for your help!
18:21:27 <Publius> For reference, JollyRoger - your explanation worked for me
18:21:31 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
18:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> Publius: whew, excellent!
18:21:47 <TheJollyRoger> I'll mark this down in the event that anybody else gets locked out.
18:25:16 <Publius> Is it known how many web installations and/or how many GOS image downloads have occurred so far?
18:26:07 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, sorry, I don't know that.
18:27:03 <Publius> I'm guessing it is purposely unknown - keeping track of such "metadata" kinda flies in the face of the GOS project, I'd think...
18:27:38 <Publius> Still, just for grins, I'd be curious to have an estimate of how many GOS devices are in use
18:28:39 <TheJollyRoger> It might be possible (and still privacy respecting, not at all invasive) to tell on the server how many times the installer has been accessed, or the last time it was accessed, or how many times the latest update OTA package has been accessed, but I'm not privvy to that, heh heh.
18:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> The update client doesn't actually transmit any unique information to the server, so each device that checks in to request and download the latest update package will look the same from our end. We don't have any way to distinguish who gets what.
18:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> But that might be one way of finding out how many GrapheneOS devices are in the wild, without being at all invasive.
18:32:18 <TheJollyRoger> It will check for incrementals in order to download delta updates (so you don't have to download large amounts of files, only the bare minimum of what's needed, to conserve your data allotment) but that's it.
18:33:50 <TheJollyRoger> And obviously, what device it's for, but it doesn't do an adversary as much good to know if a target device is a Pixel 4, or 4a, or 3 since those aren't unique.
18:34:00 <TheJollyRoger> *what family of device release it's for
19:13:16 <plate> I'm trying to install graphene through web install, but whenever I click download release, it says error: undefined
19:13:28 <plate> wait, do i need the driver
19:15:00 <nscnt[m]> plate: If you were already able to unlock the bootloader, the driver shouldn't be the issue.
19:15:16 <plate> damn. do you know what the issue may be?
19:15:40 <nscnt[m]> Unlocking was successfull?
19:15:57 <plate> Yes
19:16:07 <nscnt[m]> What phone do you have?
19:16:30 <plate> pixel 4a 5g
19:17:15 <nscnt[m]> Mh... I'm not sure whether that's already available to the WebUSB-based installation
19:17:44 <plate> Got it, so command line it is. Thanks for you help
19:18:04 <nscnt[m]> Don't quote me on that, though
19:19:08 <plate> It's alright. I've changed my rom on my oneplus 3t before. This shouldnt be too different. The web thing seemed easier and quicker though
19:28:15 <nscnt[m]> Should be available, as far as I can see. He's already gone, though.
19:41:03 <nscnt[m]> ok nvm still unsure. Hope someone can clear it up
19:42:25 <nscnt[m]> Does the release just need to be on the release server and it's available for the WebUSB-based installation, or...?
19:59:24 <nscnt[m]> ok i think i found the right code snippet and it seems to be enough
20:08:14 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Hi.  What's the easiest method to return a Pixel to stock.
20:08:33 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Just got an 4A, want to give my 3A to a family member but in its normal state.
20:11:43 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Flash.android.com should work with no problems./
20:11:49 <al3xth3k1d[m]> * Flash.android.com should work with no problems?
20:16:34 <sphinxcat[m]> <al3xth3k1d[m] "Flash.android.com should work wi"> yes but it doesn't remove the custom AVB key to fully restore back to stock
20:17:19 <al3xth3k1d[m]> What's the best method mate
20:17:28 <sphinxcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os if you want to do it
20:18:17 <al3xth3k1d[m]> <sphinxcat[m] "follow https://grapheneos.org/in"> So use the flash tool and then run that command before relocking right?
20:18:37 <al3xth3k1d[m]> I'm then gonna try and flash my new pixel from my old pixel using WebUSB for science lol
20:18:56 <sphinxcat[m]> <al3xth3k1d[m] "So use the flash tool and then r"> yes
20:19:58 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Awesome.  Right gonna need to install GalliumOS on the ChromeBook again it seems.
20:20:15 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Thanks for the help
20:22:08 <al3xth3k1d[m]> The crostini passover I don't really trust.
20:32:50 <zizari[m]> Hello, does anyone have a minute to help a beginner?
20:35:01 <zizari[m]> I have an app that I need for work that looks to be blocked by GOS.  Doing its job, but I need to have it for my job pretty urgently.
20:35:24 <al3xth3k1d[m]> If it needs google services you are out of luck mate.
20:35:38 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Far as I'm aware MicroG etc doesn't work on gOS
20:35:47 <zizari[m]> Indeed, I was thinking that was the case and hoping that there was a work around.
20:37:01 <zizari[m]> It is firebase, which is a google thing.  I got the phone specifically for the un google nature, but I thought there were sandboxing aspects that allowed me to use some of the google services.
20:37:57 <Albert> i just installed grapheneos on pixel 5, however, i'm getting error messages when trying to play videos from NewPipe.  anyone else experiencing this?
20:41:48 <r0tt0r[m]> <Albert "i just installed grapheneos on p"> guru meditation?
20:43:40 <r0tt0r[m]> try 0.20.10 if on older version, could be the usual cat & mouse game from youtube, and btw offtopic topic
20:44:19 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Yeah happens regular with NewPipe.  I updated today and its working fine
20:53:12 <badactor[m]> What's the easiest way to flash my pixel 4a back to stock android?
20:54:07 <al3xth3k1d[m]> <al3xth3k1d[m] "So use the flash tool and then r"> This.
20:54:51 <al3xth3k1d[m]> <sphinxcat[m] "follow https://grapheneos.org/in"> Sorry.  This
20:57:11 <banjo[m]1> badactor: depends. do you still have warranty?
20:58:19 <shibboleth> how (un)likely is it that they'll add functionality for bluetooth mac address randomization?
20:58:25 <al3xth3k1d[m]> <banjo[m]1 "badactor: depends. do you still "> Why is warranty relative?  Cause I'm about to flash a 3A back to stock now.
20:58:59 <badactor[m]> shibboleth: it's less than a year old
20:59:05 <shibboleth> ?
21:00:06 <shibboleth> ofc, any existing pairings will be broken, but imo you should be able to change it at least once, so that you're not spamming a non-ephemeral UUID to anyone within earshot
21:01:47 <badactor[m]> banjo: what's the best method?
21:02:21 <DanielePinna[m]> Hello everyone.... sorry to disturb with potentially a trite question. Will there ever be support for the Pixel 5? I can't find anything recent on the internet about it.
21:02:43 <banjo[m]1> badactor: brick it and request a new one.
21:03:21 <badactor[m]> banjo: doesn't seem easy haha

21:03:59 <kepoff[m]> > <@dpinna:matrix.org> Hello everyone.... sorry to disturb with potentially a trite question. Will there ever be support for the Pixel 5? I can't find anything recent on the internet about it.

21:05:16 <DanielePinna[m]> <kepoff[m] "https://grapheneos.org/releases#"> Thank you so much!
21:07:53 <banjo[m]1> badactor: quite a few people bricked their 4a5g s by flashing 4a image the consensus being that they should send them back under warranty. couldn't tell you the success rate tho.
21:09:30 <badactor[m]> banjo: I have the regular 4a, I had read here that there was a simple way to re flash stock image with some sort of web tool
21:11:30 <banjo[m]1> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
21:39:29 <badactor[m]> banjo: I've done everything in the list except flash it. I still have original powershell open. I have the factory image folder on my desktop. How do I move into correct directory before I flash
21:41:58 <badactor[m]> Can anyone help with this part?
21:43:38 <Publius> Don
21:43:51 <Publius> Not sure I'm qualified to answer...
21:44:06 <Publius> But wouldn't you just key in the command: cd sunfish-factory-2021.02.07.17
21:44:26 <Publius> Only replace sunfish-factory-xxxxxxx  with the actual file name of the stock OS image?
21:44:52 <badactor[m]> Publius: yes, but I'm using the stock Android. So that's how to do it?
21:51:14 <badactor[m]> Publius: you were correct, thanks for the help
21:51:53 <Publius> thumbs up!
22:35:45 <damienrg[m]> Hi, I am trying to flash a 4a 5g image via cli but the process is stuck after the phone reboot to fastbootd.
22:36:26 * damienrg[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/WqlXsGdCeZPSgSDBPXWlvSmy/message.txt >
22:36:42 <damienrg[m]> Any idea?
22:42:15 <damienrg[m]> If I reboot I got: `fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable.`
22:42:44 <Publius> My bet would be your data cable
22:42:57 <Publius> Try a different cable and/or USB slot on your PC
22:43:23 <shibboleth> i'm asking yet again, the only other person present yesterday did not know: is it possible to get a root sdb shell in grapheneos recovery?
22:43:26 <shibboleth> adb shell
22:43:40 <shibboleth> in *recovery*, not system
22:44:25 <Publius> It is common for some USB cables to work fine for transferring files - and even begin the flashing process - but yet not be able to fully complete the flash. In fact, this same thing happened to me.
22:45:44 <Publius> Regarding root in recovery: I don't think so. The project developers do not want there to be any root access at any level of the device, for security purposes. I'm no expert on this, so I could be wrong... but having hung out around here awhile, I don't think you can do the root adb shell
22:54:47 <shibboleth> ok, i need to manipulate a file in efs (/persist), any ideas?
22:56:23 <shibboleth> anyone have grapheneos running, mind firing up adb shell and check permissions on /persist?
22:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: Hang on a minute, I will do tha.t
22:58:38 <shibboleth> ty
23:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> shibboleth: Looks like if I run "adb shell ls -lah | grep persist" it returns:
23:01:50 <TheJollyRoger> l??????????      ? ?         ?        ?              ? persist -> ?
23:02:05 <shibboleth> hmm :)
23:02:11 <shibboleth> cd /persist
23:02:13 <shibboleth> ls -al *
23:02:35 <TheJollyRoger> It replies: "/system/bin/sh: cd: /persist: Permission denied."
23:02:53 <shibboleth> right, so it's root:root 700
23:03:26 <shibboleth> what about "mount | grep persist"
23:03:32 <TheJollyRoger> You could do it using a userdebug build, I think.
23:03:44 <TheJollyRoger> Here we are:
23:03:45 <shibboleth> of graphene?
23:03:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
23:04:09 <rny> why are you asking
23:04:11 <TheJollyRoger> "/dev/block/sda2 on /mnt/vendor/persist type ext4 (rw,seclabel,nosuid,nodev,noatime,data=ordered)"
23:04:50 <shibboleth> right. are these builds offered as first-party downloads?
23:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> No, you'd have to build it. We don't release internal userdebug builds since they should never be used in production.
23:06:14 <TheJollyRoger> However, there is documentation on GrapheneOS.org for building the operating system.
23:06:24 <shibboleth> sure
23:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/build the easiest way is here, using Arch.
23:06:55 <TheJollyRoger> I'm curious, what are you trying to do?
23:07:24 <TheJollyRoger> Since userdebug builds shouldn't ever be used for anything but debugging and testing.
23:31:02 <ride> Hello! I am having trouble connecting to a wifi network that uses 802.1X Enterprise with PEAP and MSCHAPV2.
23:31:02 <ride> The settings menu requires me to put in a domain, which should be optional.
23:31:40 <ride> I believe it is a Graphene issue, as I am able to connect from my computer without inputting a domain and other people with android phones are able to connect.
23:54:30 <BobSacmanto[m]> Is there a way to make LineageOS more secure like disabling debug settings, securing selinux policies, prevent rollback on updates?
