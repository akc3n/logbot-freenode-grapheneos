00:57:18 <qubits> hi
01:07:59 <Guest38> Hi guys, I've just started using GrapheneOS and I a few questions. Is there anyway to increase the number of volume steps? And does GrapheneOS resample 44.1 khHz audio to 48 kHz?
01:43:08 <role> Hi i get message cant find vaild opariting systhem, what can do i this situation?
01:44:31 <strcat[m]> follow the installation process
01:44:32 <strcat[m]> and finish it
01:44:41 <strcat[m]> don't try to boot before it's done
01:44:46 <strcat[m]> if you get an error, don't try to boot
01:44:52 <strcat[m]> it means you didn't finish installing
01:45:00 <strcat[m]> you either got an error and ignored it or interrupted the installation process
01:45:08 <strcat[m]> go back and follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web
01:52:19 <role> Error: Unable to claim interface.
01:56:21 <strcat[m]> sounds like you have adb or another instance of the web installer / something else running
01:56:32 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to use adb even with our official CLI install guide
01:56:37 <strcat[m]> if you followed an unofficial guide, that's the issue
01:56:48 <strcat[m]> I recommend rebooting both your phone (back to bootloader interface) and the computer
01:57:09 <strcat[m]> make sure to only try to use 1 instance of the web installer (close the existing tabs, just start over with a new one after reboot) and don't use adb, etc.
02:11:47 <faxing[m]> Is it true that you should avoid Orbot for things like Graphene due to deanonymization from personal information sent in requests?

02:18:30 <faxing[m]> "Things like Graphene". By that I meant custom ROMs , but I suppose the question would apply to all Android.  Just didn't know if it'd be different cause of Google phoning home on non degoogled phones, hence why I phrased my question the way I did.  So yes, Orbot should be avoided for system-wide use?
02:19:21 <faxing[m]> A: could you maybe elaborate a bit on why? Or was my reasoning correct?
02:19:21 <faxing[m]> B: would a trustworthy VPN be better?
02:19:57 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> I use mullvad and orbot
02:20:04 <faxing[m]> (Sorry for all the questions, just trying to learn as someone who's used Orbot almost as long as they have Android)
02:21:22 <Pratyush[m]> Depends on use case, if you don't have any invasive apps (like spotify, WhatsApp or something similar).
02:21:22 <Pratyush[m]> Stock Graphene without any logged in account, in that case you can use orbot.
02:21:23 <Pratyush[m]> Otherwise big NO for system wide use case.
02:22:45 <faxing[m]> So if I someone sticks to like Masto, Element, and Signal for example, Orbot's fine?
02:22:59 <faxing[m]> Also again, would a VPN be better for a more general use case?
02:23:20 <faxing[m]> * So if I someone sticks to like Masto, Element, and Signal for example, Orbot's fine?
02:23:20 <faxing[m]> (Not my real use anymore necessarily, just an example)
02:23:54 <faxing[m]> * Also again, would a "trustworthy" VPN be better for a more general use case?
02:23:54 <faxing[m]> (I'm aware of their shortcomings)
02:24:36 <Pratyush[m]> Again signal have your ids and mixing it with no ids system (anonymous) is going to create problem.
02:24:36 <Pratyush[m]> Even if you trust signal it's kind of against the anonymity rules.
02:24:36 <Pratyush[m]> Also for long running QNA or discussion please ask in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org .
02:25:43 <faxing[m]> Okay so Signal use is a no over tor, got it
02:26:01 <faxing[m]> * Okay so Signal use is a no over orbot, got it
02:26:08 <faxing[m]> Thank you
02:26:16 <faxing[m]> I appreciate the help greatly
02:26:35 <Pratyush[m]> If you have created and always used your element/matrix account on tor then it's fine to use it with tor. Otherwise big NO.
02:26:58 <faxing[m]> Okay, thank you.
02:27:33 <faxing[m]> I'll try to re-ask my VPN question in the offtopic room. Thanks again

02:44:25 <jjstopper[m]> Hi. I don't know if this is a Pixel question or a Grapheneos question. When the Pixel finishes booting up Grapheneos there is a notification sound I cannot seem to turn off. I cannot find it in settings. Does anyone know if this is something that cannot be turned off? Thanks
02:47:17 <raska> I love this OS, my only & I mean ONLY gripe & it's not really a gripe is that I would love to see the google bootsplash on my pixel flash de-googled ! That would be sweet !
02:48:19 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <raska "I love this OS, my only & I mean"> This has been answered before, please look through the logs before asking (this goes to everyone)
02:48:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But to answer your question
02:48:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> The bootsplash is a hardware thing
02:49:04 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You can't change it
02:49:31 <raska> jjstopper[m]- I would say it's a settings thing ?
02:49:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If a Google phone, it displays a Google bootsplash, OnePlus then OnePlus bootsplash
02:50:01 <jjstopper[m]> raska: I cannot find it in settings
02:52:37 <raska> Railgun_Lover[m]I'm sure it's not the first time & it wont be the last. Just would be the cherry on top of the icing !
02:55:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> raska: if you can wait 3 years, maybe a little longer, GrapheneOS will release custom hardware
02:55:25 <raska> jjstopper[m what have you got on in the Sound-advanced_?
02:55:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Then you'll have Graphene bootsplash
02:55:51 <raska> Railgun_Lover[m] Now you have me excited !!!
02:56:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <raska "Railgun_Lover Now you have me ex"> Good
03:02:01 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Welcome role
03:02:47 <jjstopper[m]> raska: I turned on do not disturb and restarted the phone and didn't get a notification. It would be a pain to do that everytime. All the "other sounds and notifications" are turned off
03:03:32 <raska> Railgun_Lover[m] The only issue with custom hardware is it so hard to keep up with the big players, though I don't think it would worry most of us already using Graphene, the hardware side would be a BIG bonus !
03:04:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> jjstopper: what notification are you getting
03:04:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Oh wait
03:04:52 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Just the sound you're getting
03:05:24 <jjstopper[m]> Railgun_Lover: when I start or restart my Pixel 4 it makes a notification sound when its done booting up. Can't seem to turn it off without do not disturb
03:05:30 <Railgun_Lover[m]> I think that's just standard booting up noise, I get that on stock too
03:06:10 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Check if there's an "on startup" setting or similarly named
03:06:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> raska: grapheneos thrives on lots of memory so expect a powerful machine
03:07:01 <jjstopper[m]> Well if do not disturb can disable it maybe we could get an option to disable it? I'm not saying that option doesn't exist I just haven't found it
03:07:51 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <jjstopper[m] "Well if do not disturb can disab"> Yeah I don't know how you can disable it without do not disturb
03:08:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But let me check (on stock)
03:08:07 <Thatcher[m]> You can change the sound to no sound
03:09:13 <jjstopper[m]> Thatcher: how?
03:10:34 <Thatcher[m]> Settings > Apps & Notifications > Notifications > Advanced > Default notification sound
03:11:06 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Settings > Apps & Notifications "> Wait doesn't that make all notifications silent
03:11:23 <jjstopper[m]> Thatcher: OK... I'll restart see what happens
03:13:08 <jjstopper[m]> Thatcher: that didn't work. Still got that annoying notification the phone is finished booting
03:13:26 <Thatcher[m]> It does work
03:14:13 <Thatcher[m]> Set the default notification sound to none
03:14:20 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Thatcher: doesn't that make all notifications silent
03:14:27 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
03:14:33 <Thatcher[m]> All system notifications
03:15:36 <jjstopper[m]> Thatcher: you're right sir thanks. My bad. I thought I got it set to none but apparently didn't
03:16:05 <Thatcher[m]> You'll still get notifications from apps you use. You just won't get notified of system updates and stuff
03:16:34 <Thatcher[m]> Audible notifications that is
03:17:00 <jjstopper[m]> Thatcher: but I'll still see an update icon at the top right?
03:17:06 <Thatcher[m]> Yes
03:17:12 <jjstopper[m]> Thanks!
03:17:14 <Thatcher[m]> The only thing that is affected is the sound
03:17:22 <Thatcher[m]> You got it buddy

06:20:20 <markonak> hi all, i'd like to ask, how to prevent apps to auto start / auto run on boot?
06:20:34 <markonak> is there any control for this behavior?
06:49:29 <strcat[m]> background restriction toggle to reduce background activity and force stop to fully prevent it
06:49:53 <strcat[m]> background restriction toggle is not meant to be a meaningful privacy/security feature
06:50:00 <helllo> Hello everyone, I got a bootloop after the last Lineage OS 18.1 Update (dipper). Can some one help me please?
06:50:06 <strcat[m]> stopping apps from starting on boot, etc. does not stop them running
06:50:13 <strcat[m]> helllo: this is not a channel for LineageOS
06:50:57 <helllo> Sorry. Because nobody ever answer... on their channel. Thanks anyways.
06:51:04 <markonak> why is that strcat?
06:51:45 <strcat> markonak: because that's not how the security model / permission model works, it's designed to prevent access to sensitive data, not rely upon apps not running
06:52:03 <strcat> markonak: and stopping an app from running in the background much is not the same thing as preventing it running in any possible way
06:52:26 <strcat> markonak: if you don't want it able to run, force stop works, but perhaps you should just be uninstalling the app
06:52:51 <strcat> background restriction is a distinct thing from force stop
06:53:08 <strcat> and you can still start up a force stopped app, it just can't start itself
06:53:25 <strcat> if you don't want it in that profile, why do you have it installed in that profile?
06:54:35 <helllo>  does waze works without google service ?
06:55:35 <drstone> hi, i am new to grapheneos. i would like to install my email client, protonmail. i downloaded a bin file from their website but then how do i install it ?
06:56:38 <strcat> please use 1 account
06:56:38 <helloworldkk87[m> You need the .apk
06:56:47 <strcat> do not create a bunch of different nicknames here
06:56:52 <strcat> use 1 account or you will be banned
06:57:11 <strcat> stop asking things from different nicknames, use 1
06:58:13 <drstone> if i go to their website it states that its apk download. in fact i am getting bin file instead
07:02:06 <strcat[m]> be specific about what you're downloading
07:02:46 <drstone> https://protonapps.com/protonmail-android
07:03:15 <drstone> trying to get apk from android section
07:03:45 <strcat[m]> okay and that's a .apk not what you're saying
07:04:53 <helllo> @drstone try aurora store from fdroid ?
07:04:54 <drstone> not really. once i download it vsaves the file with .bin extension
07:06:31 <strcat[m]> nope, you're just doing it wrong then
07:07:03 <strcat[m]> also doesn't seem specifically related to GrapheneOS
07:07:07 <strcat[m]> suggest getting support from them
07:07:33 <strcat[m]> are you actually using GrapheneOS? are you downloading it with Vanadium?
07:08:04 <drstone> i use duckduckgo browser
07:08:14 <strcat[m]> use Vanadium
07:09:28 <drstone> true. that solved the problem
07:09:38 <drstone> thank you
07:10:02 <strcat[m]> DuckDuckGo browser just uses Vanadium WebView anyway
07:10:14 <strcat[m]> they probably implement downloads wrong (one of the few things they have to implement themselves)
07:11:06 <drstone> good to know. switching back to Vanadium then
07:29:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Does the location GPS not work ? I've tried magic earth and it's not working

09:05:29 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> I have an app permission security question, I'm on grapheneOS but idk if this specifically would apply to it.
09:05:29 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> A pomodoro timer and tracker app asks for accessibility permissions to block certain applications(which the user selects) while the timer is running. This seems to work by 'redirecting' those apps to the timer app. ie when you tap the app, it opens timer app instead.
09:05:29 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> How much, if at all, is this a security risk? The app doesn't have network or storage permission but does it leave the phone vulnerable in other way?
09:07:53 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> Here is a link to the appliction itself:
09:07:53 <RahoonGOAWAY[m]> GetFlow: https://f-droid.org/packages/org.wentura.getflow
09:23:06 <Guest38> How do I increase the number of volume steps on GrapheneOS? Audio is always either too soft or too loud for me
09:23:11 <princemachiavell> If the app became compromised it could be used to redirect any app to any app... It would also could open malicious URLs. And anything else the accessibility permission allows. It increases the attach surface. It comes down to how much you trust the developer and f-droid to prevent malicious code from getting in.

13:24:53 <Xatian> Hello, so when I install a apk on grapheneOS, start the app and later uninstall it --> what can the app do to my phone? I am asking specifically about data (temp-files, logs, databases) ... will some data created by the app remain on the phone when the app is uninstalled or is everything purged?
13:36:16 <Jasper[m]1> Once you uninstall the app there’s nothing it can do to your phone unless it somehow bypassed the sandbox that apps live in
13:37:38 <Xatian> what about the files it created on my phone while it was installed and running ... will these files be deleted when I remove the app?
13:38:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> G (@h​kfdjvv) has joined the Telegram Group!
13:38:55 <Jasper[m]1> If they’re located inside the apps internal storage, yes.
13:38:55 <Jasper[m]1> Suppose it has access to shared storage (if that’s still a thing) or say your photo library and it puts a photo there then yes obviously that would still be there once you delete the app
13:39:38 <Pratyush[m]> madaidan.:  i think you are right in this case, because really it have no practical benefit in security regards.
13:39:38 <Pratyush[m]> i think i have seen this question.
13:40:12 <Jasper[m]1> <Xatian "what about the files it created "> There’s no executable code left behind if that’s what you’re asking
13:43:23 <Xatian> no the executable code is not the issue ... I would assume that all of it is gone when I uninstall the app :-). I am more interested in the garbage that is usually left behind when uninstalling an app --> like on linux where a lot of apps write to some hidden folder in the home directory and even if you remove the app via apt files there remain
13:43:24 <Xatian> most of the time
13:44:18 <Xatian> my question is not about the stuff I can see in the user directories like photo library you mentioned ... but more about the hidden / system folders I normally don't look at.
13:48:43 <Pratyush[m]> Xatian:  It's completely depends on the app, afaik if app target newer API version and don't opt in to legacy storage permission.
13:48:43 <Pratyush[m]> then everything app have created got wiped unless you choose to keep storage data (you will get an option while uninstalling).
13:48:43 <Pratyush[m]> but again not all app at this time target newer API level and some apps opt in to use legacy storage permissionmodel.
13:49:33 <Pratyush[m]>  * madaidan.:  i think you are right in this case, because really it have no practical benefit in security regards.
13:49:33 <Pratyush[m]> i think i have seen this question.
13:49:33 <Pratyush[m]> edit: my bad not in this group*
13:50:12 <Xatian> i understand ... thank you!
13:52:30 <Jasper[m]1> <Xatian "my question is not about the stu"> No it can’t access directories beyond its own app storage. That’s the beauty of Android when compared to traditional Linux desktop systems. Applications can’t just leave junk all of the place and they can’t mess with files and directories they’re not supposed to.
13:53:16 <Jasper[m]1> Apart from select API’s that you explicitly give access to..
13:57:13 <Guest38> How do I increase the number of volume steps on GrapheneOS? Audio is always either too soft or too loud for me

14:07:30 <Xatian> Jasper[m]1 nice. thank you!
14:17:28 <nscnt[m]> Guest38 (IRC): You've got an answer 10 hours ago already. You can always change the volume with the slider instead of the buttons.
14:17:51 <Guest38> The slider has the same steps as the buttons
14:18:01 <Guest38> Tried myself
14:18:15 <Guest38> IOS is a different story
14:28:04 <nscnt[m]> Guest38 (IRC): There's no other setting
14:30:43 <Guest38> Oh.. Could a setting be implemented sometime down the line? Also about the Android resampling of 44.1 kHz audio to 48 kHz, does Graphene do the same?
14:34:38 <nscnt[m]> Guest38 (IRC):  There are no changes in how audio is handled compared to AOSP. It's not a priority
14:35:29 <Guest38> Yup
18:17:10 <emacsen> hey all. As a new Graphene user, I guess the Mozilla Location services are no beuno?
18:19:46 <lapse[m]> big no bueno
18:20:40 <strcat[m]> emacsen: it's not supported and is quite flawed anyway
18:20:49 <strcat[m]> we'll be adding geocoding support
18:21:09 <emacsen> strcat[m], I'm not asking about geocoding as much as geolocation
18:21:23 <strcat[m]> geolocation doesn't require that kind of service
18:21:35 <strcat[m]> there's GNSS and A-GPS via cellular network
18:22:03 <strcat[m]> we're not going to add a service that sends your location info to a third party server
18:22:10 <emacsen> strcat[m], my apps never find the location, no matter how long they're on :(
18:22:10 <strcat[m]> or even our own server, we don't want to have that
18:22:29 <strcat[m]> emacsen: make sure location services are enabled
18:22:37 <strcat[m]> use SatStat to verify that it's working
18:22:45 <emacsen> they're on for the apps I want
18:22:49 <strcat[m]> it's possible you're using broken apps or apps that only support the Play services location APIs
18:22:54 <strcat[m]> emacsen: no there's not just a permission
18:22:59 <emacsen> OSMAnd
18:23:04 <strcat[m]> emacsen: there's per-app permission *and* you need to have location services enabled globally
18:23:15 <strcat[m]> emacsen: the Play Store version of the app may not work properly without Play services
18:23:27 <strcat[m]> emacsen: please follow my suggestions including using SatStat to check that it's working
18:24:04 <strcat[m]> and if you want it to work better either give the app background access rather than only foreground or leave it in the foreground until it gets a lock
18:24:37 <emacsen> running satsat now... compass seems to be working so far
18:25:20 <emacsen> OSMAnd said it got a GPS location... Satsat doesn't see anything yet though
18:26:49 <emacsen> and location is on (I don't see explicit GPS permissions anywhere). Yet nothing in satsat
18:28:27 <strcat[m]> there is no GPS permission, permissions are about types of data
18:28:31 <strcat[m]> Location is the type of data
18:28:45 <emacsen> okay, well it's on and this app has permission, but it's not finding any satelites
18:28:58 <strcat[m]> whether it comes from GNSS (more than GPS is supported), / A-GPS, nearby Wi-Fi networks, nearby cell towers, nearby Bluetooth devices
18:29:02 <strcat[m]> that's all Location, for a reason
18:29:14 <deadlydata[m]> woah thats cool, i wish i could make my location services not work at all. i hate it.
18:29:17 <strcat[m]> emacsen: you have it open in the foreground, with the permission?
18:29:22 <strcat[m]> deadlydata: just turn it off...
18:29:24 <emacsen> yes, both
18:29:44 <strcat[m]> emacsen: both?
18:29:52 <strcat[m]> emacsen: by foreground I mean actively open / visible on your screen
18:30:16 <strcat[m]> anyway if you're outside and GNSS isn't working your hardware is broken
18:30:22 <emacsen> I'm inside
18:30:33 <emacsen> but need to go now, will have to debug later
18:30:34 <strcat[m]> emacsen: try going to a window at least then
18:30:54 <emacsen> strcat[m], need to run but will try later.
18:30:58 <strcat[m]> emacsen: you probably don't have GNSS reception and A-GPS won't simply guess based on cell networks alone
18:31:21 <strcat[m]> it uses nearby cell networks to greatly reduce time to get a proper lock but it doesn't guess solely based on those
18:34:54 <ExtrovertedNerd> I am having issues with the mobile hotspot being painfully slow. I am on the Pixel 4XL, on Verizon. I did two back to back speed tests. On the phone I got nearly 200Mbps, and right after that, through a device connected via the hotspot, I got 0.45Mbps. Through the hotspot I alwasy get just under half a Mbps, no matter how fast the phone's data
18:34:54 <ExtrovertedNerd> connection really is. My guess, Verizon is throttling me. But, how do they know when I am using hotspot vs not? And, how do I hide that from them? NordVPN did not work. Was still throttled to 0.45Mbps.
18:35:45 <strcat[m]> via TTL
18:35:55 <strcat[m]> set TTL one higher on the device that's tethered
18:35:57 <strcat[m]> and try that
18:36:24 <strcat[m]> we'll have a way to work around this later on at the expense of losing hardware acceleration (lower battery life, higher CPU use)
18:41:22 <strcat[m]> btw next release has backup support in secondary profiles among other nice changes
18:47:02 <ExtrovertedNerd> Okay. Just learned what TTL is. That's nifty. I've found a few resources explaining how to modify it. I'll come back if that doesn't work. Thank you for your quick response.
18:50:26 <nikoleos[m]> <strcat[m] "btw next release has backup supp"> Does backup and restore can  be done from one device to another ?
18:50:51 <strcat[m]> yes
18:51:35 <nikoleos[m]> is there a file to store on an external drive ?
18:51:45 <strcat[m]> you can backup directly to an external drive
18:51:57 <strcat[m]> or move it there
18:52:01 <strcat[m]> I think it's pretty straightforward
18:53:34 <nikoleos[m]> Ok thanks , nice 😁

19:05:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!:)> Hi there
19:05:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!:)> Is there a way to mirror with an hdmi
19:18:29 <Pratyush[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!:)> Is there a way to mirror w"> pixel officially does not support hdmi output afaik,
19:23:57 <c66> hi all absolute monkey here here trying to get graphene on my pixel 4 using the super simple web installer mode, couldnt get past the "flashing factory image" part it would just sit on "restarting device" on the web installer and have me sat in fastbootd on my device, the instruction say wait which i tried for a very long time and it never launched
19:23:58 <c66> back into the bootloader, as a result i eventually selected power off on fastbootd on my pixel and it launched into bootloader, i thought perhaps it worked and i locked the bootloader only for my pixel to say it cant find a valid operating system and its no longer picking up when i plug it in to my pc try restart the process, where do i go from
19:23:58 <c66> here? hope i haven't bricked it or something
19:36:30 <ah___> I'm no expert, but can you still launch the bootloader?
19:38:27 <c66> no just stuck on the cant find a valid operating system screen
19:39:22 <c66> i turn it off/on same result, volume and power same result not sure what else as even my pc cant pick up that its plugged in
19:40:07 <Pratyush[m]> c66:
19:40:08 <Pratyush[m]> there is good chance your usb is slow because once firmware/image has been downloaded it does not take to long flash.
19:40:08 <Pratyush[m]> simple solution for you is try flashing again from unlocking steps.
19:41:16 <c66> hi yeah i waited hours its not a slow usb, but again i cant restart as the flashing process as i can no longer pick up my phone on my pc
19:41:43 <Pratyush[m]> windows or linux ?
19:42:07 <c66> windows
19:43:40 <Pratyush[m]> try running fastboot devices, is it show you any devices?
19:43:40 <Pratyush[m]> or do you get any new devices in device manager when you connect your device?
19:43:40 <Pratyush[m]> and last question, i hope you did't installed old legacy fastboot or adb
19:44:04 <Pratyush[m]>  * try running fastboot devices, is it show you any devices?
19:44:04 <Pratyush[m]> or do you get any new devices in device manager when you connect your device?
19:44:04 <Pratyush[m]> and last question, i hope you didn't installed old legacy fastboot or adb
19:44:57 <nscnt[m]> c66: You must be booted into the bootloader interface. Are you?
19:46:42 <nscnt[m]> c66: It sounds like you had a bad connection when flashing. Try a different cable/port
19:47:00 <c66> okay so nothing in device manager, i installed via this guide: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
19:49:48 <c66> okay im not in the bootloader on the phone dont think either, looks similar but just says "cant find valid operating system device wont start" and my only option is the the power button which says "press power button to power off"
19:50:02 <c66> turning on and off gets me back to this same screen
19:50:13 <nscnt[m]> c66: Boot into the bootloader interface again
19:50:29 <c66> how would i do that?
19:50:42 <nscnt[m]> The same way as before
19:50:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​oyerx> I have the same problem.
19:51:23 <c66> like i said already that way doesnt work nscnt
19:51:48 <nscnt[m]> c66: It does work. Turn off your device and boot into the bootloader interface again
19:53:10 <c66> it wont do that nscnt
19:53:16 <c66> just back to this screen
19:53:30 <nscnt[m]> c66: You aren't booting into the bootloader interface
19:53:31 <Pratyush[m]> in other word press your power button and vol - at same time and wait for fastboot interface
19:53:36 <c66> power button and vol just bring me back here
19:53:46 <c66> yeah i know
19:54:40 <Pratyush[m]> <c66 "just back to this screen"> can you send a screenshot or something? "remember to mask you private info on screen"
19:55:28 <c66> ill see if i can get a photo the only camera i have is this phone lol
19:56:27 <nscnt[m]> c66: Press and hold the power button and volume down button until you're booted into the bootloader interface. Release the power button first, then the volume down button.
19:57:01 <nscnt[m]> The fact that you don't have a valid operating system is irrelevant. You don't boot into the bootloader interface the right way
19:57:40 <c66> dont get me wrong im a dumb ass hence getting in the situation using the dummy ver web installer, but yeah its genuinely not loading into bootloader  i know how to do it as thats how this situation started
19:58:24 <c66> yeah gotcha i know it inst an instant thing let me try get a pic/vid for you gotta track down something with a camera lol
19:58:35 <Pratyush[m]> just relax, we are here to help if you try to get into bootloader everything will be fine
20:00:39 <c66> i am dont worry just thrown why bootloader wont launch
21:07:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Sal (@S​alimium) has joined the Telegram Group!
21:10:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​alimium> Hello all,I'm trying to understand differences in kernels between this project and sultan, elemental, proton etcIs it possible or advisable to try a 3rd party kernel for battery saving / wireguard support whilst retaining strong GrapheneOS-designed security? Looking to become a patron if suitable. Many thanks for any help
21:13:40 <Railgun_Lover[m]> @Salimium Are you trying to use GOS without the Linux kernel?
21:13:56 <Railgun_Lover[m]> If so you can't
21:14:48 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Everything in GOS needs the Linux kernel to function, syscalls, etc
21:15:35 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You'd need to port everything to another kernel which takes a long time
21:15:52 <Railgun_Lover[m]> And then it's not GOS
21:20:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!duck> no
21:20:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!duck> grapheneos bundles a hardened kernel
21:38:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​alimium> Thank you all, this is the answer I was looking for. I'll just use the web installer and benefit from the GOS kernel
21:45:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!:)> How to mirror on the TV trough the uabc c and an HDMI adapter?
21:45:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!:)> Is there any app?
21:45:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!:)> That actually works
21:45:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!:)> Or any accessory

23:04:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> Thanks from me, too - just happened to have asked a similar question in GOS-OT.
23:15:08 <dig_nerds[m]> Hi all! Can I ask some questions here?
23:15:31 <dig_nerds[m]> I am flashing GrapheneOS into my phone right now
23:16:19 <Pratyush[m]> dig_n  erds   yes you can.
23:17:19 <dig_nerds[m]> Sorry I fixed it, but I will definitely come back
23:18:37 <dig_nerds[m]> Your web flash is way way much better than Ubport's installer tool.
23:20:00 <doittoit[m]> On pixel 4xl GOS, having come from a Sam Note 9. With same behavior patterns I have noticed a huge loss in call quality using WiFi calling. Unfortunately, the phone is not usable right now for my needs.
23:20:00 <doittoit[m]> Any facts to share, or help on this?
23:24:06 * Pratyush[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UsGMbNbhhTrKmVbtelMhnNoN/message.txt >
23:24:18 <Pratyush[m]> * Some carrier like to do shady stuff, include better support there closed source app that need to included otherwise there service work but might not as well as might on some other device including that closed source apps.
23:24:18 <Pratyush[m]> In any way it's completely depends on carrier and your WiFi, for me it's work great for airtel but jio is kind of hit and miss.
23:24:18 <Pratyush[m]> Graphene doesn't make any changes related to calls it's same as what we get in AOSP.
23:25:09 <Pratyush[m]> * Some carrier like to do shady stuff, include better support in there closed source app that need to included as system app otherwise there service work but might not as well as might on some other device which included that closed source apps.

23:38:01 <dig_nerds[m]> Is GrapheneOS developed by Russia company?
23:38:57 <strcat[m]> no...
23:39:08 <strcat[m]> it's not developed by a company and it has no connection to Russia
23:41:11 <dig_nerds[m]> When I got last error
23:41:27 <dig_nerds[m]> The error message was written by Russian
23:43:33 <digital_sisyphus> 😬
23:45:32 <strcat[m]> dig_nerds: error from what?
23:45:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> K / free software hater (@U​_can_call_me_k) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:45:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <U​_can_call_me_k> @clannad unban me yeet
23:46:07 <dig_nerds[m]> strcat: Wait, oh no!
23:46:29 <dig_nerds[m]> Sorry I messed... The error message is not from the GOS
23:46:45 <dig_nerds[m]> That message showed up by web-installer
23:46:54 <dig_nerds[m]> But was from bootloader
23:47:04 <strcat[m]> the bootloader isn't russian either
23:47:10 <strcat[m]> can you just be clear about what you're talking about
23:47:13 <strcat[m]> what message
23:47:48 <strcat[m]> if your locale is set to russian then some errors will be russian because the browser, etc. provides them
23:47:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> dig_nerds: you must have seen the recovery screen
23:48:09 <dig_nerds[m]> An error message from bootloader written by Russian I don't know, I fixed it simply by refresh web page.
23:48:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Afaik there's a place the recovery can read locale prefs off
23:48:17 <dig_nerds[m]> anupritaisno1: Yes
23:48:24 <dig_nerds[m]> strcat: Nope, never ever
23:49:10 <strcat[m]> unless you had the device configured to use russian
23:49:17 <strcat[m]> I don't see how you got anything in russian
23:49:26 <dig_nerds[m]> strcat: Thats what I was thinking
23:49:49 <dig_nerds[m]> But I don't even read Russian, so I do not...
23:50:33 <dig_nerds[m]> anupritaisno1: Pretty much you are right...
23:50:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> dig_nerds: there's no real need to worry
23:52:01 <dig_nerds[m]> anupritaisno1: Thank you :)
23:52:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you are still concerned
23:52:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can retry the installation
23:52:44 <dig_nerds[m]> I suspect it was just got into a random locale
23:52:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> That'd give you peace of mind
23:53:37 <dig_nerds[m]> Russian characters does not take away the peace of the mind lol
23:54:25 <dig_nerds[m]> They have a lot of good stuff like Kaspersky and Telegram
23:55:49 <dig_nerds[m]> Got my GOS installed successfully!
23:57:38 <dig_nerds[m]> I was trying to install Ubports yesterday... It was not as smooth as GOS installation lol.
23:57:52 <digital_sisyphus> Hi, I'm thinking of using grapheneOS for a brand new phone I've just gotten.  Do you guys mind if I ask some general questions about what using it on a daily basis is like?  I checked the website but didn't see anything quite like that posted
23:58:34 <digital_sisyphus> main question being, are there any basic file types / common apps that one would usually encounter that don't work well?
23:59:12 <dig_nerds[m]> Please allow me to extend your question a little bit
