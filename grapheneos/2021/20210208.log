00:02:12 <zelzek[m]> will do, charging it up now and hoping to find the sim tray. always something on a sunday
00:03:12 <TheJollyRoger> All backed up.
00:03:17 <TheJollyRoger> Just in case.
00:03:26 <zelzek[m]> that exchange with smuggler was comical
00:03:44 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: if we find no issues, anything we should say/do?
00:04:09 <strcat[m]> let me know but so far it looks good
00:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok!
00:04:50 <TheJollyRoger> Phone's set on "Beta", it's plugged in and got WiFi and data. Ready!
00:06:01 <snooopy> TheJollyRoger: Did you do that with your production phone?
00:06:05 <zelzek[m]> there's always that guy that wants espionage level privacy/anonymity/security.  while they may intersect, absolutely disparate models
00:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> snooopy: Only one I have at the moment.
00:06:41 <snooopy> okay, with a backup that sounds safe enough~
00:06:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:07:02 <snooopy> and if it helps strcat[m], I'm in too..
00:07:04 <snooopy> :)
00:07:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
00:07:39 <snooopy> -installing-
00:08:31 <TheJollyRoger> I'll come back and tap "Check" every couple of minutes or so.
00:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. I parked a channel for beta testers a bit back. Maybe now I should reactivate it?
00:09:23 <TheJollyRoger> I have an idea.
00:09:44 <TheJollyRoger> Anyone who's running beta, can you join #grapheneos-beta for the moment?
00:10:42 <Citizen528[m]> What's up. I've used lineageos for 5 ish years now. Looking at getting a pixel 4 so I can use grapheneos. What impact is there on the camera from using grapheneos? Is it not as good as with factory google android on it?
00:11:42 <Citizen528[m]> Also I read that the pixel 4 has the fingerprint sensor disabled for grapheneos, is this true? Is there an easy way to enable it and use it? I do NOT want to use facial scanning.
00:11:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Citizen528[m], the AOSP camera app isn't as nice nor feature-rich as Google Camera is. OpenCamera comes close, although it's not as flashy.
00:12:14 <sphinxcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#camera
00:12:23 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: the Pixel 4 doesn't even have a fingerprint sensor at all.
00:12:29 <Citizen528[m]> Is the camera driver open source or is something the community has created? IDC about the actual app honestly.
00:13:01 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: the Pixel 4 never has, never has had, and never was designed to have a fingerprint scanner. The easiest way to get a fingerprint scanner would be to get the 4a, its successor/budget device.
00:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: there are no closed-source drivers on the pixels, at all.
00:14:24 <Thatcher[m]> <Citizen528[m] "Also I read that the pixel 4 has"> While Pixel 4 lacks a fingerprint reader, the Pixel 4a fingerprint reader works flawlessly
00:15:30 <Thatcher[m]> with GrapheneOS that is
00:15:54 <snooopy> ^ can confirm
00:16:40 <Citizen528[m]> Weird. The project owner talks about it here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
00:16:40 <Citizen528[m]> >On the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, support for fingerprint unlock as a secondary unlock mechanism has been removed and replaced with IR-based 3D facial scanning.
00:17:29 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: Yes. The 4a and 4 are different devices. The 4a is a cost-reduced version of the 4 which was released after the 4.
00:17:39 <Citizen528[m]> Hmm well I'll look into the 4a then
00:18:01 <zelzek[m]> finding your old sim tray from a phone you thought was binned is like waldo
00:18:10 <Citizen528[m]> Does grapheneos have the covid tracing framework crap built in?
00:18:20 <Thatcher[m]> <Citizen528[m] "Does grapheneos have the covid t"> Hell no
00:18:52 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: The 4a and 4a5G too, are also different devices. Google named the 4a5G a confusing name; in practice, the 4a and 4a5G have nothing to do with each other, they are entirely different devices and attempting to flash a 4a image onto a 4a5G will result in permanent and irreversible damage to the phone.
00:18:59 <strcat> Citizen528[m]: no that's Play services, we don't have Play services or any reimplementation of it built in
00:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: GrapheneOS does not, and will not bundle play services. COVID tracing apps depend on play services to run, and as a result, with Play Services absent from the phone, they won't run.
00:19:39 <zelzek[m]> and that makes me happy that there's no play api.. thing is a nuisance
00:19:44 <Citizen528[m]> I'll be honest, having an active matrix chat for discussion of this time is a major plus. LOS has an unofficial room and their main forum is on reddit which I despise.
00:19:45 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a Beta releases are not available
00:19:47 <strcat[m]> please help test
00:19:52 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 Beta coming soon
00:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I'm ready.
00:20:24 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: Yarr, well, welcome aboard this ship!
00:21:13 <Citizen528[m]> <strcat[m] "Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a Beta rel"> Hold up, so there is no non-beta release for these devices? Only beta? That's not what I've read.....
00:21:33 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: not what I said
00:21:42 <Citizen528[m]> Or are you talking about for a new version of grapheneos
00:21:47 <strcat[m]> a new version
00:21:52 <TheJollyRoger> Citizen528[m]: the beta release is just for the update at this moment, before it becomes stable.
00:21:59 <strcat[m]> all new versions go through Beta channel before going to Stable
00:22:01 <bbhead[m]> I would see about doing beta, but not sure what you want for feedback.
00:22:13 <TheJollyRoger> Updates are is tested first, then get sent to be further tested by the beta, BEFORE they are marked stable.
00:22:23 <strcat[m]> bbhead:  if anything is broken that wasn't before
00:22:24 <Citizen528[m]> <strcat[m] "all new versions go through Beta"> I gotcha. Thanks
00:22:50 <bbhead[m]> Okay. I'll see about switching to beta when in get home.
00:23:31 <bbhead[m]> Any special apps you want tested?
00:24:06 <TheJollyRoger> bbhead[m]: I think a fairly good routine might be something along the lines of:
00:25:07 <TheJollyRoger> Send and recieve text messages, make and recieve calls, check the clock (set an alarm, let the phone sleep, check to see if the alarm sounds), browse the internet, open and close apps, see if any of the bundled apps malfunction, take pictures and video, browse files.
00:25:19 <TheJollyRoger> Basically, just check to see if something new has broken.
00:25:33 <zelzek[m]> tried a cricket, att/h20, and tmo clean sim no unlock.  found a trick that might work by resetting, skipping everything for setup besides wifi, let it update for a while, and see if it'll carrier unlock
00:25:34 <TheJollyRoger> When testing the camera make sure to test both the front facing and rear-facing cameras.
00:25:40 <bbhead[m]> Okay. Sounds easy. Ish
00:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:25:58 <TheJollyRoger> Just basically try to use your phone as much as you possibly can, for tasks that normal people would use their phones for.
00:26:17 <TheJollyRoger> The trick is, if something's already broken, it's not worth reporting. If something *NEW* has broken though, that's an issue to raise.
00:26:28 <TheJollyRoger> If you do find one, the thing to do is immediately file the issue on the issue tracker, and include:
00:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> - A description of the issue that was broken, and as much information as possible.
00:27:15 <bbhead[m]> Okay. Will read up some more on it and sign up for beta release.
00:27:17 <TheJollyRoger> - Your device type (whether it's a Pixel 4, 4a, 3, or 3aXL, etc etc)
00:27:56 <TheJollyRoger> I have a channel for beta testers at #grapheneos-beta
00:28:48 <TheJollyRoger> However, that channel's not for general chatting/asking questions, it's only really used for beta testing, that's it. I'll go around asking you guys to test or file results if you found any.
00:29:40 <bbhead[m]> Okay.
00:30:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back in a bit.
00:39:42 <zelzek[m]> guess i'll update this thing and let it sit for a while and go for a walk.  likely it's not going to be able to be unlocked.
00:46:51 <strcat> new release for Pixel 4, 4 XL and 4a is now available in Beta
00:46:53 <strcat> please help test
00:56:17 <zelzek[m]> will load 4beta in a few.
01:04:52 <signalarch[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I have a channel for beta tester"> Bridged to matrix?
01:16:03 <zelzek[m]> let's see if we can se t-mobile to unlock ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
01:23:12 <Device_Manager[m> <zelzek[m] "let's see if we can se t-mobile "> Took me 7 Pixel 4XLs to finally get a customer service rep to Carrier Unlock the Device.  I told them I am part of a Dev Team that makes Custom ROMs, Kernels and other MODs for the device.  I didn't even open or activate the device yet, he was going to Whitelist the IMEI I was currently on, I said I was just sent a replacement and I didn't take it out the box incase
01:23:12 <Device_Manager[m> I had to shoot for #8
01:23:29 <braxtono[m]> When switching users on graphene does it log them off in the background or eat up memory?
01:24:01 <Device_Manager[m> Does Graphene still monitor Reddit?
01:25:00 <Device_Manager[m> <TheJollyRoger "However, that channel's not for "> Where at?  On Element or TG?
01:26:34 <strcat> braxtono[m]: you choose if you want to end session
01:26:42 <strcat> braxtono[m]: there's an end session button in 2 places
01:27:00 <strcat> you choose if you want to use that or switch users and leave it running (can have 3 running in bg atm maximum)
01:27:41 <strcat> luckily whoever it was complaining that their kids keep pressing end session stopped complaining about it
01:27:56 <zelzek[m]> and...... unlocked.
01:28:06 <zelzek[m]> thank you nice mr t-mobile rep, you're a pal
01:36:46 <Jaysan> Hi all!¬† I'm a newb at all this, just working my Pixel 3.¬† got pretty far along the instructions, but stalled at the flashing part.¬† when i double click flash all, a black command prompt flashes, then nothing happens at all.¬† so i tried to just type flash-all.bat in the command prompt, and i get this in response.¬† anyone have any ideas on

01:40:57 <strcat> would have answered
01:41:07 <strcat> need people to stop using unofficial guides
01:41:37 <strcat> they're wrong and dangerous
01:43:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Jaysan: please use the official guide only
01:43:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you use an unofficial video you will not get support here
01:43:27 <strcat[m]> they timed out
01:43:29 <strcat[m]> not here anymore
01:43:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> We literally have a webusb installer
01:43:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's wrong with these people
01:44:03 <strcat[m]> yeah and it's also mentioned in first paragraph of CLI install guide now
01:44:08 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: they don't look at our docs
01:44:12 <strcat[m]> they follow these unofficial guides
01:44:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also we did have an unofficial guide that at least wasn't harmful
01:44:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: a couple people made proper guides
01:44:58 <strcat[m]> but it's better for people to use WebUSB installer
01:45:00 <strcat[m]> if they can't follow ours
01:45:02 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Would a YouTube video help, I wonder?  I feel like some people go there first
01:45:17 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: use the official CLI guide or the web installer
01:45:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://youtu.be/jNAR4eKeIdg
01:45:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> mr_hebi_san: here
01:45:26 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: you're using an incorrect unofficial guide and you risk bricking your device
01:45:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> I did pay someone to do a proper YouTube video
01:45:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> It was never released because the webusb installer came
01:45:45 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
01:46:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> mr_hebi_san we did have a guide that I personally looked over and it involved just copy-pasting everything from the official guide
01:46:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> But that is just not needed anymore
01:47:24 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I'm just testing the Pixel 4 Beta build right now. Last test is the timer/alarm clock test. In a few more minutes, I'll see if that one finishes, and then I'll have a report on my gist shortly. Everything else works.
01:47:37 <Jaysan> oh wow... i was following mikethetechsavy guide on youtube.¬†¬† bad call?
01:47:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can use webusb installer and push a few buttons to install the OS. It is also far safer than the method of downloading a script
01:47:46 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: use our official pages
01:47:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Webusb only gets access to one device
01:47:50 <mr_hebi_san[m]> You'd be surprised anupritaisno1
01:47:51 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: use the web installer
01:47:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Jaysan: read the official guide/use webusb installer
01:48:02 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: yes. Unofficial guides result in bricked devices.
01:48:14 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: https://grapheneos.org/install/web you don't have to do any CLI stuff or install any software
01:48:24 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: you can open https://grapheneos.org/install/web in Microsoft Edge and do the install by pressing buttons there
01:48:27 <Jaysan> gotcha.¬† thanks for this.¬† i will use the web guide now
01:48:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> mr_hebi_san: anyway we have a proper unofficial video guide ready, it's just that webusb is a far more practical and safer way
01:48:35 <Jaysan> thanks!!
01:48:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> You don't need to download anything for webusb
01:48:42 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: Edge, Chrome, Brave, etc. all work
01:48:44 <mr_hebi_san[m]> A simple video with a cheerful narrator doing the web install steps could prevent people from finding these outdated videos
01:48:56 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: it won't unless we pay someone famous to do it
01:49:10 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: there is no use in someone with 1k subs making one
01:49:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> You don't need to mess with windows registry to flash it (enterprise edition users will know the pain)
01:49:23 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: it's not that simple. Most of these outdated install guides are from people who get a lot of views on YouTube and as a result, are ranked very highly in search engine optimization, so a lot of people end up going there.
01:49:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> It only gets access to one device and you can attest immediately after that
01:49:44 <strcat[m]> I did get Google to remove one of them as an infobox search result
01:49:51 <strcat[m]> via a complaint of it being inaccurate and bricking devices
01:50:02 <strcat[m]> but doesn't make things much better
01:51:04 <NicolasWest17838> Hi, i changed my phone number via SMS, but my about phone still shows my old numbet
01:52:17 <Jaysan> OMG THIS LOOKS SO EASY
01:52:32 <Jaysan> i nearly killed myself using the command prompt lol.. wow.
01:52:35 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: it is as long as you have a quality USB cable
01:52:46 <Jaysan> i just bought a new one.
01:52:57 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: new doesn't mean quality :P, but hopefully it is
01:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: Use the cable that your cellphone came with, for best results, or make sure it's a high-quality, fully-traced one. I have had the best luck with Aukey and Anker cables because they are fully traced.
01:53:42 <Jaysan> question though... i'm already part way through, i already unlocked the bootloader, and my phone is sitting in the fastboot mode "unlocked".¬† should i just skip that step and keep going with the download and flash?
01:53:48 <TheJollyRoger> Note that the majority of problems most people have with the Web Installer tend to be caused by substandard/improperly traced cables, or the firmware on your motherboard not properly implementing all of the features that USB has to offer which the fastboot protocol makes use of.
01:53:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw TheJollyRoger I might need advice getting new cables
01:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: just go to the download and flash section.
01:53:59 <Jaysan> lol
01:54:06 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: yeah, what's up?
01:54:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Both Amazonbasics cables I got are dead lol
01:54:26 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: o.O
01:54:27 <strcat> amazon basics are shit tier
01:54:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ok hang on a second.
01:54:33 <strcat> never buy amazon basics products
01:54:38 <TheJollyRoger> *beep beep beep*
01:54:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I didn't
01:54:44 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: good news, the timer works.
01:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I bought them...
01:54:52 <Thatcher[m]> amazon basics is diarrhea
01:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> T_T
01:54:56 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
01:55:16 <strcat> amazon basics exists so that you can get counterfeit quality products without the counterfeiting
01:55:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ill say it in pm
01:56:51 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: they ripped me off too
01:56:58 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I bought 2 cables from amazon basics
01:57:01 <strcat> returned both
01:57:02 <strcat> not to spec
01:57:06 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
01:57:11 <TheJollyRoger> So it's not just me, either.
01:57:14 <strcat> bought displayport with current version and usb
01:57:15 <strcat> both bad
01:57:17 <strcat> returned both
01:57:36 <strcat> they also make the worst knives ever
01:57:44 <strcat> steak knives that are like butter knives
01:57:45 <TheJollyRoger> What happened with mine was that the little rubber sleeve where the jacket connects to the plug popped out.
01:57:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well they died
01:57:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> I thought my board had died
01:57:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oops
01:57:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also TheJollyRoger that cable almost bricked my phone lol
01:58:04 <TheJollyRoger> o.O Holy shit.
01:58:14 <strcat> avoid amazon basics for real tho
01:58:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> It errored out right after flashing the bootloader
01:58:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> If it was just one second earlier
01:58:32 <TheJollyRoger> Holy cow.
01:58:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Would have bricked
01:58:40 <TheJollyRoger> YIKES
01:58:56 <fbzdfvb> Is there any way to check a cable is legit or not?
01:59:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not blaming you but that happened
01:59:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> fbzdfvb: ideally use what's in the box
01:59:39 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Er, are you going to send a PM?
01:59:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> For me oneplus cables work too
01:59:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> But watch out, oneplus has usb 2 cables only
02:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: https://gist.github.com/Peter-Easton/14d4df792b6006d458a582b49f0609c3 For you. Beta test on the Pixel 4. Nothing broken that wasn't broken before.
02:00:58 <Jaysan> Thanks Strcat and @jollyroger!¬† just flashed it... and going to lock it now.¬† my cable is from a company called insignia.¬† seems to be working ok so far
02:01:11 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: excellent!
02:01:27 <strcat[m]> Jaysan: see way easier
02:02:23 <Jaysan> super easy
02:02:54 <Jaysan> I've got a bunch of friends who want this done to.¬† YES to privacy!
02:08:13 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: Welcome aboard the ship!
02:08:56 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Generally speaking, is it the case that a USB cable that works for app development in Android Studio should also work for ROM flashing?
02:09:25 <strcat[m]> no
02:10:06 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: if you and your pals find GrapheneOS useful, and/or want to support the devs' efforts, please consider donating at https://grapheneos.org/donate, the project's funded entirely by donations, they keep this ship sailing and allow the work to continue as an independent open source project that won't have to answer to corporate monetization or venture capitalism! It helps, greatly.
02:11:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <strcat[m] "no"> Not surprising given what I've learned these past weeks.  I've been fortunate it seems.  Thank you for all the good information.  I'll continue to donate regularly at this rate.
02:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: You rock! On behalf of the project we really appreciate the aid!
02:19:47 <Device_Manager[m> <TheJollyRoger "Jaysan: if you and your pals fin"> What is the average donation amount?  I'm used to donating new devices
02:20:21 <TheJollyRoger> Device_Manager[m: I actually don't know, I'm not privvy to that and I don't think that data's even enumerated.
02:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> Device_Manager[m: if you are good with bitcoin, it's possible to look up the bitcoin address on the website since bitcoin transactions are all made publicly, but I can't help you there since I'm not a HODLer.
02:22:51 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <Device_Manager[m "What is the average donation amo"> In don't think there is any set standard.  I donated about as much as In would expect to pay for a commercial OS license.
02:23:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> * I don't think there is any set standard.  I donated about as much as I would expect to pay for a commercial OS license.
02:23:46 <Device_Manager[m> <TheJollyRoger "Device_Manager: if you are good "> O ok, na don't mess with bitcoin, I should have many years ago, if you didn't buy years ago, not worth it.
02:25:30 <strcat[m]> it's currently worth 4x what it was feb last year
02:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> Wow, really shot up.
02:26:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mr_hebi_san: You rock! On behalf"> You all really work hard to earn the support IMO.  This is one of the most supportive, knowledgeable, and dedicated crews I have seen
02:26:18 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: yay~ It warms my heart to hear that~~
02:33:23 <Lighwake[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "You all really work hard to earn"> I've only been here one day, and I'm REALLY impressed!
02:33:34 <TheJollyRoger> \o/
02:33:45 <snooopy> strcat[m]: My beta report, build on TheJollyRogers template: https://daten.reisen/plis17
02:34:01 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! 4a and 4 accounted for! Anyone else have any more...?
02:34:27 <TheJollyRoger> The more, the merrier, the more people testing the Beta reports, the more likely we'll catch any of those hidden bugs before they go to Stable!
02:41:25 <timetravelingman> I have a bug, I keep getting text messages from my dad saying he's disappointed in me
02:41:29 <timetravelingman> How to fix?
02:51:11 <squarmkt[m]> <ted_lavender[m] "My location I am pretty much lim"> Just from listening to others T-Mobile seems to work better, but Verizon isn't bad, voicemail and LTE only dont work for me yet, but its not unusable
02:52:16 <zzxx123> timetravelingman get a new dad
02:55:41 <squarmkt[m]> <strcat "never buy amazon basics products"> Sounds like I got lucky then
02:56:18 <zelzek[m]> <timetravelingman "I have a bug, I keep getting tex"> don't dissapoint your dad?
02:57:26 <timetravelingman> Spoken like a true abusive dad
02:57:29 <timetravelingman> Godspeed
02:58:13 <zelzek[m]> never met my father, so wouldn't know a thing about parenting.
02:59:22 <zelzek[m]> <TheJollyRoger "strcat: https://gist.github.com/"> confirm the same.
03:01:22 <zelzek[m]> <Device_Manager[m "Took me 7 Pixel 4XLs to finally "> i just told the rep in india i'm a neurosurgeon that dropped his phone and needs vital information.  he said it sounded important.  got it taken care of.
03:03:27 <Device_Manager[m> <squarmkt[m] "Just from listening to others T-"> I swear by TMO, happy with their service and even happier with their customer service.  FYI : TMO Help on twitter has more authority then Customer Care #. BUT be prepared to spend a lil extra time because the reps are handling multiple customers at one time....
03:03:58 <zelzek[m]> the online reps are defintely more potent
03:04:17 <Device_Manager[m> <zelzek[m] "i just told the rep in india i'm"> Are you?  I honestly work with several Dev Teams for several devices.
03:04:40 <zelzek[m]> yes, but i didn't drop my phone
03:05:12 <zelzek[m]> retired 5 years ago, now i just tinker with security and programming (hobby)
03:06:41 <Device_Manager[m> <TheJollyRoger "The more, the merrier, the more "> Flashing one of my 4a(s) shortly.  I've been a Android user since 2010, and I like to research first.  I don't understand what is so difficult and why so many are having issues,  just bad cables?
03:09:44 <timetravelingman> They're retards
03:21:40 <zzxx123> Wow calm down bro
03:26:59 <zelzek[m]> getting a little bit pre-school here.
03:40:51 * happy-1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XCCHJeFpCaIMogRYtFsWHHmO/message.txt >
03:42:56 <somenerd[m]> probably network time things
03:43:15 <somenerd[m]> believe that it uses the location
03:43:20 <somenerd[m]> can't confirm yet though
03:44:29 <happy-1[m]> Is it because I loaded graphene os from a computer in my city and its some how saved that info in the background I would of thought a factory reset would delete everything tho?
03:45:31 <somenerd[m]> it's nothing like that, that's almost certain
03:46:46 <somenerd[m]> pretty sure that it used the approx location to set the time
03:46:53 <somenerd[m]> and that should mostly be it
03:47:18 <somenerd[m]> still can't confirm completely though
03:47:43 <happy-1[m]> Its saving or finding my city location some how even with no WiFi and no sim
03:47:43 <happy-1[m]> My language set to Indian English and next setting was choose your time which it already knew some how
03:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> happy-1[m], don't forget that phones all have GPS, you should be able to use your phone to find your location on the planet.
03:50:10 <somenerd[m]> it's just network time or something right?
03:50:36 <TheJollyRoger> I think so, in addition to that, but I'm not sure.
03:50:49 <happy-1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "happy-1, don't forget that phone"> That must be it then so the GPS is actually still tracking in the background
03:51:04 <somenerd[m]> no
03:51:06 <TheJollyRoger> happy-1[m]: You can switch it off once you've got your phone set up.
03:51:11 <somenerd[m]> it's just tracking for the time
03:51:14 <happy-1[m]> <somenerd[m] "it's just network time or someth"> Yes its the 2nd option after a wipe
03:51:16 <somenerd[m]> and then you can shut it off
03:52:14 <redbeard72> Howdy, if I buy a Pixel 4 that says "Verizon Locked" should I be able to unlock it? (I heard Verizon phones have no sim card, so not sure if that will effect being able to use it on any carrier)
03:52:17 <TheJollyRoger> Device_Manager[m: The problem with cables is that most consumer grade cables actually aren't fully traced. They're often missing one or more wires, because most vendors simply implement the bare minimum of features that most users will use, and disregard all the rest, to save money.
03:52:34 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: No, you will not be able to unlock it.
03:53:17 <redbeard72> so glad I asked before buy it :) Is that only for "Verizon locked"? or for other carriers too?
03:53:42 <redbeard72> phones locked* to other carriers
03:54:14 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: The difference is in the bootloader: locked variants set a "carrier ID" value in the phone's read only partition to a value of 1 or more. This cannot be changed.
03:54:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, if a phone is locked, you should not buy it. You'll need to make sure you get a *bootloader unlocked* device.
03:54:40 <happy-1[m]> It also happens when installing signal even on a swiss VPN it knows what number code your country your in is
03:54:40 <happy-1[m]> With all the time and language set to different country's
03:55:33 <happy-1[m]> Signal must some how tap into your GPS?
03:55:44 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: the safest way to make sure you don't get ripped off is to actually buy the phone directly from Google Store itself. This is going to sound ironic, but it's actually the safest way. Many resellers actually don't know the difference between "carrier locked" and "bootloader locked" and sometimes it's possible to get a phone that's bootloader locked without being carrier locked.
03:56:13 <redbeard72> TheJollyRoger: ok. But then what are all the "unlock your phone" videos about?
03:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> happy-1[m]: It's more likely that you've got the language and regional preferences set, and the app is respecting your preferences.
03:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: In the old days, there were sometimes ways to ask your phone carrier to unlock the /modem/ of your device so you could use it with another carrier, and sometimes, people have discovered exploits to be able to bypass the operating system's check and respect for the persistent carrier ID.
03:57:57 <TheJollyRoger> These don't always work though and it's likely by the time you learn of them, they've already been patched and will no longer work.
03:58:19 <TheJollyRoger> Plus, even if you do find one that's working, it could *stop* working at any moment, so I would not choose to rely on exploits.
03:58:55 <redbeard72> ok. how do you auto complete a nick without doing what I just did?
03:59:07 <TheJollyRoger> You probably pressed TAB
03:59:12 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: I strongly do not recommend you look at any of these instructional videos on YouTube for phone unlocking,
03:59:12 <redbeard72> correct
03:59:17 <TheJollyRoger> You're more than likely to end up bricking your phone
03:59:41 <happy-1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "happy-1: It's more likely that y"> If the signal app was respecting my preference it would be starting the number log in part with a swiss code or if going off time settings would be Malaysia or language would be India its some how knowing I'm in aus?
03:59:45 <redbeard72> got it. I will avoid that. What do I press to auto complete a nick in hexchat?
04:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: type in the first three or four letters of a nickname, and press TAB.
04:00:12 <Jaysan> ¬†Thanks again TheJollyRoger and strcat for your help.¬† everything installed well.¬† wish you guys a great night :)
04:00:25 <TheJollyRoger> Jaysan: Yarr, fare thee well shipmate!
04:00:37 <Jaysan> :)  !
04:00:59 <redbeard72> ok that works. Strange that it auto posts every nick in the room beginning with "T" if I press "T" + Tab
04:01:01 <Applebaum273894> My 'about phone' shows an old number
04:01:16 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: try typing in "thejo" and pressing tab.
04:01:21 <Applebaum273894> How to i get my about phone to update
04:01:35 <TheJollyRoger> I have to go and will return later.
04:02:01 <redbeard72> Fare thee well, thanks for the help.

04:14:21 <Adam258633674> The about phone section is supposed to show my current phone number
04:14:38 <Adam258633674> But shows my old number

04:14:59 <take_a_deep_brea> i meant i am not sure what had gone wrong .
04:15:26 <Adam258633674> I can change my number via SMS

04:32:33 <git[m]> Mine has been the same for months. Don't think it's a GOS issue, more an issue with the provider. Doesn't affect anything other than being a minor annoyance
04:34:40 <bbhead[m]> Aurora store may have to enable or disable 'custom tokenizer' in settings under network. Thread about it in their github
04:35:29 <Adam2586336742> Any1 know how to refresh or update the about phone info

04:48:37 <happy-1[m]> Just to update before it was this background app giving my real location
04:49:18 <happy-1[m]> Not sure how it happen after wipe tho as I didn't have internet
04:49:38 <strcat[m]> happy-1: factory reset doesn't wipe the time
04:50:08 <strcat[m]> the time zone you set is saved
04:50:09 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "happy-1: factory reset doesn't w"> Ah OK got it thanks
04:50:56 <strcat[m]> it's not location but rather configured time zone
04:51:05 <strcat[m]> you must have chose to use the America/CityName time zone or whatever
04:51:09 <strcat[m]> like America/Toronto
04:51:15 <happy-1[m]> I did the signal again with setting changed and location was unknown
04:52:14 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "you must have chose to use the A"> They where set to Asia pretty sure was the background app
04:52:37 <strcat[m]> it sets your time zone to what your mobile network says by default
04:52:41 <strcat[m]> you can choose to set it manually
04:52:49 <strcat[m]> time and time zone are set automatically by default
04:52:53 <strcat[m]> and they are saved in hardware
04:53:06 <strcat[m]> you can override them
04:53:34 <strcat[m]> factory reset doesn't wipe out time / time zone and start at some filler value
04:53:37 <strcat[m]> it'll still have the right time
04:54:26 <strcat[m]> it could, but it doesn't do that, just not really what it's supposed to do
04:55:23 <happy-1[m]> Strange cause before the wipe it was already set to Manuel and other country's
04:55:23 <happy-1[m]> It knew location on reset setting up device
04:55:26 <strcat[m]> also you said you set the language
04:55:43 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "also you said you set the langua"> Yea to India
04:55:57 <strcat[m]> so if you want to play with it reset again
04:56:01 <strcat[m]> and set it to american english instead
04:56:12 <strcat[m]> it probably picks you a new timezone based on language
04:56:17 <strcat[m]> rather than giving you one in america
04:56:55 <strcat[m]> I could look at the code and tell you how it guesses
04:57:02 <happy-1[m]> I'm pretty sure is like you 1st said its saved my location from the background system app ( not the language or time zone )
04:57:20 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have your location if you factory reset
04:57:22 <strcat[m]> that's not what I said
04:57:29 <strcat[m]> what I said is that it gets time zone from mobile network by default
04:57:50 <strcat[m]> factory reset again and choose american english
04:57:56 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "happy-1: factory reset doesn't w"> ?
04:58:35 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "what I said is that it gets time"> There was no sim install and I wasn't on a WiFi tho
04:58:48 <strcat[m]> but you put a language tied to a region
04:59:06 <strcat[m]> so simply based on that it's likely going to not be starting the default time zone as america
04:59:26 <strcat[m]> factory reset and choose american english and see what time zone it gives you
04:59:28 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "but you put a language tied to a"> Yea was India before the wipe then India just after wipe I'm in aus and it knew this?
04:59:29 <strcat[m]> or choose british english and see
05:00:31 <strcat[m]> happy-1: you know you could look and see
05:00:35 <happy-1[m]> <happy-1[m] "Yea was India before the wipe th"> When it suggested time zone it said aus and also my city which I can't understand
05:00:50 <strcat[m]> mobile network
05:01:09 <peculiarly_small> Is there any way to change the accent color from blue to something else?
05:01:12 <happy-1[m]> No sim in tho and no WiFi was connected
05:01:34 <strcat[m]> happy-1: no SIM in != airplane mode on
05:01:35 <happy-1[m]> Yes
05:02:02 <strcat[m]> you can see make an emergency call without a SIM
05:02:03 <strcat[m]>  * you can still make an emergency call without a SIM
05:02:03 <happy-1[m]> <happy-1[m] "Yes"> Actually no
05:02:04 <happy-1[m]> Aeroplane was not on as I just wiped it
05:02:17 <strcat[m]> that's what I'm saying
05:02:24 <happy-1[m]> Yea maybe that's it then makes sense
05:02:45 <strcat[m]> so what you are saying is that it chose the right time zone again?
05:03:38 <happy-1[m]> After the wipe it knew my city even after choosing India as my language and it was no sim in and was not connected to wifi
05:04:58 <strcat[m]> you can read what it says for the time zone default setting
05:05:03 <strcat[m]> it chooses it based on mobile network
05:05:28 <strcat[m]> it has no other way of getting it automatically
05:05:31 <strcat[m]> that's the only way it has
05:05:47 <strcat[m]> so either it guessed it based on the saved time offset
05:05:54 <strcat[m]> or it got it again from the mobile networks
05:06:09 <strcat[m]> more likely mobile networks
05:06:12 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "it has no other way of getting i"> So must get from the emergency service right as I didn't have a sim in?
05:06:23 <strcat[m]> no SIM != no mobile service
05:06:25 <Adam25863367422> Any1 know how to refresh or update the about phone info
05:06:40 <strcat[m]> Adam25863367422: open it again
05:06:40 <Adam25863367422> My about phone is showing an old number
05:06:56 <strcat[m]> open the page again
05:07:00 <Adam25863367422> Ok, still showing old phone number
05:07:11 <strcat[m]> so that's what the network is saying is your phone number
05:07:57 <strcat[m]> happy-1: mobile networks say the region they're in
05:08:03 <strcat[m]> happy-1: as in the time zone
05:08:11 <Adam25863367422> When i call people though, thry see a different number
05:08:28 <strcat[m]> happy-1: so, normally, what happens on AOSP / stock is that the device gets both time and time zone from mobile networks - we don't get time from it, still get time *zone*
05:08:47 <strcat[m]> Adam25863367422: sounds like a mobile network issue
05:08:55 <strcat[m]> Adam25863367422: turn off the device for a minute and then boot it again
05:09:02 <strcat[m]> maybe that makes your mobile network give new data
05:09:10 <Adam25863367422> Ive restarted already
05:09:12 <strcat[m]> you'll have to take it up with them if there are issues with their network
05:09:27 <Adam25863367422> Everything is working, calls sms data
05:09:27 <strcat[m]> the OS just gets that from your carrier
05:09:40 <Adam25863367422> Just the phone info is showing my prior number
05:09:40 <happy-1[m]> <strcat[m] "happy-1: so, normally, what happ"> Understand I've set that to all off now but at time of wipe there was no sim which can't work out how the phone knew my city
05:09:41 <strcat[m]> if they return the wrong value, it'll show the wrong value
05:09:45 <strcat[m]> all it knows is what they say
05:09:57 <strcat[m]> happy-1: no SIM != no mobile service
05:10:41 <strcat[m]> at least atm we don't set airplane mode by default, doesn't really seem useful when it's not the OS shipping from the factory anyway
05:10:45 <strcat[m]> we could if we really wanted
05:10:56 <strcat[m]> just one more thing for users to get confused about though
05:11:02 <strcat[m]> with no clear benefit
05:11:08 <take_a_deep_brea> true
05:11:33 <Adam25863367422> Airplane mode should be on upon installation, and allow us to set LTE only mode while airplane mode is still on
05:12:00 <Adam25863367422> So the first xonnection to the network is lte only
05:12:19 <take_a_deep_brea> <strcat[m] "at least atm we don't set airpla"> Adam25863367422:  .
05:12:43 <Adam25863367422> Also, whats the Hostname gos uses on wifi?
05:12:47 <strcat[m]> we could set airplane mode by default - it would make sense for our own devices
05:12:59 <strcat[m]> Adam25863367422: https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
05:13:00 <Adam25863367422> Mac is randomized, but whats the hostname
05:13:17 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy-associated specifically
05:13:26 <strcat[m]> > The DHCP client uses the anonymity profile rather than sending a hostname so it doesn't compromise the privacy offered by MAC randomization.
05:13:32 <strcat[m]> same as AOSP
05:13:44 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use a hostname
05:13:58 <Adam25863367422> Great
05:14:11 <Adam25863367422> Does my laptop need to use a hostname
05:14:49 <strcat[m]> nothing needs to set one
05:15:05 <strcat[m]> if you were running a port of GrapheneOS on your laptop it wouldn't be setting one
05:15:12 <strcat[m]> (or AOSP)
05:15:25 <Adam25863367422> Nice, ill set a really generic mac on my laptop then like "linksys"
05:15:27 <strcat[m]> your laptop's Wi-Fi card probably leaks identifiers
05:15:34 <Adam25863367422> True
05:15:36 <strcat[m]> Adam25863367422: you can avoid setting one altogether
05:15:49 <strcat[m]> setting it to a specific, weird value like that reduces privacy
05:15:59 <Adam25863367422> Just a blank hostname " "
05:16:04 <strcat[m]> no
05:16:11 <strcat[m]> blank is not the same as not providing one
05:16:21 <strcat[m]> anyway as I said
05:16:38 <strcat[m]> your laptop Wi-Fi card likely leaks identifiers
05:16:42 <strcat[m]> shrug
05:24:05 <Adam238683274732> hi
05:24:12 <Adam238683274732> My About phone is showing an old number
05:24:16 <Adam238683274732> and i just changed my number again
05:24:24 <Adam238683274732> And verified my new number with caller ID test phone number
05:24:32 <Adam238683274732> But About phone is showing old number
05:26:06 <Adam238683274732> Also, my phone is getting Stingrayed/IMSI catcher'd, I've set LTE-Only mode, but do you know any other defences? I suspect I'm being targeted by civilian hackers because of my Prominence in my community.
05:27:09 <Adam238683274732> My LTE Signal drops, as my phone connects to the IMSI Catcher Base station
05:27:22 <Adam238683274732> Then, the LTE IMSI Catcher rejects my phone, and then I connect to the real network again
05:27:35 <Adam238683274732> But, its annoying and I'd like to prevent IMSI catching further, beyond using LTE only Mode
05:27:53 <Adam238683274732> So, Im hoping, can I set a specific CELL SITE ID, so I can connect only to "Trusted Whitelisted" Cell phone towers
05:28:10 <Adam238683274732> so the IMSI catcher would have to spoof the Legtimate cell site ID, in order for my phone to connect to it
05:28:18 <Adam238683274732> ¬†A cell site ID whitelist would be great
05:28:25 <Adam238683274732> Even though Cell Site ID can be easily spoofer
05:28:26 <Adam238683274732> spoofed
05:28:41 <Adam238683274732> Id would be 1 additional step for the IMSI catcher to spoof, to IMSI-catch my cell phone.

05:32:44 <Adam238683274732> Living inside a human host
05:32:46 <Adam238683274732> ;)
05:33:04 <rny[m]> you come in here everyday without fail to remind us and school us about stingray.
05:33:30 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
05:35:27 <rny[m]> if you're really that "prominent", you should hire a full time security engineer to maintain a fork of AOSP for you and just you alone.
05:35:44 <rny[m]> otherwise, you're pretty deluded to think that you're that prominent.
05:36:15 <Adam238683274732> Point is, im being Stingrayed/IMSI catchered
05:36:37 <Adam238683274732> So im trying to harden my phone further
05:36:42 <Adam238683274732> beyond LTE only mode, VPN, and GOS
05:36:44 <rny[m]> do it!
05:36:47 <Adam238683274732> Such as, CELL SITE ID whitelisting
05:36:57 <rny[m]> no one is stopping you
05:37:08 <Adam238683274732> seeking advice and ideas
05:37:14 <take_a_deep_brea> Adam238683274732:  any scheme of things that involves making a list is bound to fail .
05:37:24 <rny[m]> advice has been given, just do it and maintain your own fork
05:39:36 <Adam238683274732> What advices have you guys said recently?
05:39:39 <braxtono[m]> You need to swap phones . sell or barter online if needed. New sim under alias
05:39:54 <Adam238683274732> im using LTE only mode to prevent "Protocol IMSI catcher downgrade attacks", VPN and GOS
05:39:57 <rny[m]> Adam238683274732: the advice give was "just do it"
05:40:02 <Adam238683274732> Brax, Ive had over 100 phone in my lifetime
05:40:06 <Adam238683274732> But I live in the same house
05:40:09 <braxtono[m]> Gos?
05:40:15 <rny[m]>  * Adam238683274732: the advice given was "just do it"
05:40:21 <Adam238683274732> So the network monitoring FEDs can just see my phone phone geolocated to my house proximal area
05:40:28 <Adam238683274732> Telco monitoring feds*
05:40:35 <braxtono[m]> LTE stingrays are out btw
05:40:41 <Adam238683274732> can you link me to info reguarding them
05:40:52 <Adam238683274732> Ive seen LTE stingrays that can capture the IMSI, phone number
05:41:15 <Adam238683274732> "LTe hailstorm" imsi catcher can apparantly "Remotly implant malware onto phones"
05:41:22 <Adam238683274732> That was 2015 technology too
05:41:26 <braxtono[m]> It was posted in another matrix room earlier
05:41:36 <Adam238683274732> What I can confirm is I Am getting stingrayed with LTe only still
05:41:38 <braxtono[m]> I've seen certs getting pwned
05:41:52 <Adam238683274732> LTE to tower connection crypto certs? or
05:41:59 <rny[m]> you two should stop
05:42:06 <rny[m]> this is not related to graphene os and is off-topic
05:42:09 <Adam238683274732> We should keep talking about Stingrays
05:42:16 <Adam238683274732> alright, moving to offtopic
05:42:26 <rny[m]> thanks
05:42:41 <Adam238683274732> brax please continue convo in offtopic
05:42:44 <braxtono[m]> Social engineered bad agent. Set persistent malware and pwnd a graphene

05:43:38 <braxtono[m]> üê≠üê≠üê≠
05:43:38 <Adam238683274732> The persistant malware stayed on GOS? Was the malware able to read texts, record microphone, even with sandboxing etc?
05:43:45 <Adam238683274732> Phone rat? Ok
05:43:54 <Adam238683274732> What were the rats capabilities, given GOSs sandboxing
05:44:18 <rny[m]> offtopic pls
05:45:37 <braxtono[m]> I've had a grapheneOs pwned and the leftover fragments persisted flashes
05:46:11 <braxtono[m]> But it was done through physical access / eviltwin attacks
05:48:59 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
05:50:19 <rny> üî®-ready.
05:50:39 <LTE-Only-Mode1> Why did you ban us? Chill out, your supposed to Foster, and encourage conversation
05:50:42 <LTE-Only-Mode1> Silence is useless

06:25:03 <Preload[m]> Hi, just so you guys know, some troll just went batshit crazy in the offtopic room. Please be aware of trolls like him spreading FUD. Just a PSA.
06:25:24 <strcat> Preload[m]: they mostly did it here
06:25:32 <strcat> Preload[m]: it was Adam238683274732
06:25:35 <strcat> aka WhiteHackHAX
06:25:42 <strcat> aka Applebaum273894
06:25:44 <somenerd[m]> keeps changing their name
06:25:54 <strcat> I could give you 25 other nicks
06:26:00 <strcat> just by searching the logs for voice modulator
06:26:11 <somenerd[m]> or LTE only mode
06:26:20 <strcat> oh yeah LTE-Only-Mode1 was them too
06:26:22 <strcat> just now
06:30:20 <Preload[m]> https://postimg.cc/zLTZQ8h1
06:31:14 <strcat> anyway, even if it is in good faith, we have enough problems of our own
06:32:14 <strcat> I can offer technical advice, and this does not seem to be about technical things
07:01:27 <hobo0000[m]> Is there a way to make the seedvaultapp backup actual files? Because it feels kinda useless now..
07:01:41 <hobo0000[m]> Like photos documents files etc
07:02:05 <strcat> hobo0000[m]: it backs up app data, that is backing up files
07:02:24 <hobo0000[m]> Ooooh got it
07:02:26 <strcat> hobo0000[m]: you seem to be asking can it back up data stored in the home directory, i.e. not app data - no, because the focus was backing up app data
07:02:34 <strcat> because you can't back that up yourself without it
07:02:44 <strcat> and you can back up the profile home directories without it
07:02:44 <hobo0000[m]> Oh okey thanks
07:03:03 <strcat> seedvault gives you something you can't do without it (other than via adb backup)
07:03:36 <hobo0000[m]> Right
07:42:53 <AndrewBrewmaster> Hi, please set the Chromium Browser to have a 'Permanant Private Mode' so its always on Incognito Mode by default all the time, as a setting.
07:43:15 <AndrewBrewmaster> having to set each tab to incognito, and clear browsing data and cookies gets tiresome, a permanant incognito mode would be best practice, thanks.
07:43:20 <AndrewBrewmaster> Donating to Graphene OS soon =)
07:46:13 <figbert> I'm developing a cross-platform mobile app with Godot, and wondering if I can run GrapheneOS instead of Android on my testing device without breaking compatibility with mainline devices
07:52:17 <take_a_deep_brea> AndrewBrewmaster: take a look at this https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/issues/65
07:53:33 <AndrewBrewmaster> Yes Always Incognito mode is perfect

09:33:38 <take_a_deep_brea> owgrant: please try out https://grapheneos.org/install/web
09:33:54 <take_a_deep_brea> owgrant: no need to be embarassed about it .
09:33:56 <pnrxa[m]1> nothing to be embarrassed about
09:35:20 <owgrant[m]> thank you guys so much i really appreciate the quick help and the friendliness

09:36:01 <strcat> owgrant[m]: follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web rather than the CLI guide and you'll have a much better time

10:16:20 <hobo0000[m]> Cool
10:16:36 <hobo0000[m]> Again system update?? Tf
10:20:14 <Visionz[m]> Since the last update my phone reception isn't working anymore.
10:20:20 <Visionz[m]> Is that a known thing?
10:22:33 <Visionz[m]> nvm, a few reboots fixed it üëç
10:42:05 <strcat> Visionz[m]: likely just hadn't connected after reboot yet
10:42:24 <strcat> hobo0000[m]: can read the changelog at https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
10:42:37 <strcat> hobo0000[m]: releases are announced well in advance of getting to the stable channel
10:43:11 <somenerd[m]> also updates are quite frequent
10:43:14 <somenerd[m]> (afaict)
10:47:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> I am https://t.me/clannad on telegram btw
11:16:58 <strcat[m]> there were going to be at least 3 updates this month: security update, Chromium security update, update near end of month to push out the work throughout the month
11:17:18 <strcat[m]> there had to be an extra one because of needing to fix a broken edge case with the HTTPS-based network time update improvement
11:17:35 <strcat[m]> there are almost always 2 updates per month at minimum
11:18:05 <strcat[m]> security update -> update near end of month to push out changes and get prepared for the next security update (we don't want to have changes we need to beta test with the security update)
11:18:50 <strcat[m]> made https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel a bit fancier btw
11:18:56 <strcat[m]> it updates itself without refreshing the page now
11:19:05 <strcat[m]> if you're watching for the update being pushed out
11:19:24 <somenerd[m]> wait really?
11:19:28 <somenerd[m]> that's extremely cool
11:19:35 <strcat[m]> it just checks every 5 mins
11:19:38 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/static/js/releases.js
11:19:51 <strcat[m]> could make it check more
11:19:54 <strcat[m]> 5 mins seemed fine
11:20:09 <Device_Manager[m> Pixel 4a üß± by web-version
11:20:40 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: doubt it's bricked if that's what you're saying
11:20:43 <strcat[m]> just finish the install
11:20:52 <strcat[m]> make sure to use a high quality reliable cable
11:21:02 <strcat[m]> go back to the bootloader menu
11:22:05 <strcat[m]> good into bootloader menu via volume down + power on again
11:22:22 <strcat[m]> if it didn't finish installing the OS, you can't boot the OS, but you can still boot up the bootloader and flash properly
11:22:38 <Device_Manager[m> <strcat[m] "Device_Manager: doubt it's brick"> Browser was stuck on Bootloader Flash for a while I moved mouse around and page refreshed.  Attempted manually, boots back to fastboot
11:23:03 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: make sure to use a reliable cable
11:23:09 <Device_Manager[m> I am
11:23:15 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: it's not bricked as long as it can boot up the fastboot menu
11:23:25 <Device_Manager[m> I use the same cable for 4 devices
11:23:45 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: i.e. the other flashes were successful?
11:24:13 <Device_Manager[m> Well I tried switching slots, tried flashing back to stock, nada
11:24:19 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you just need to do it again
11:24:21 <Device_Manager[m> Yes
11:24:39 <Device_Manager[m> Not on web version on Fastboot flash
11:24:56 <Device_Manager[m> I did it 4 times
11:25:52 <Device_Manager[m> I been using and flashing since 2010, flashing A/b since OG Pixel.  Im no noob
11:25:56 <strcat[m]> and make sure fastboot / adb isn't running
11:26:19 <Device_Manager[m> Wait what
11:26:20 <strcat[m]> adb daemon will race with web installer to connect to the device
11:26:23 <strcat[m]> and block it from connecting
11:26:39 <strcat[m]> so that could explain it stalling
11:26:49 <Device_Manager[m> It isn't flashing manually web ain't flashing
11:27:06 <strcat[m]> what's not working specifically?
11:27:07 <strcat[m]> what's the error?
11:27:07 <Device_Manager[m> Can't book stock either
11:27:15 <Device_Manager[m> None
11:27:19 <strcat[m]> flashing stock wouldn't be any easier than GrapheneOS
11:27:39 <Device_Manager[m> At the end something about didn't fully fornat
11:27:49 <strcat[m]> can you show the output?
11:28:09 <Device_Manager[m> No shit, tried unbricking
11:28:24 <Device_Manager[m> If I flash again
11:28:40 <Device_Manager[m> Are u a Dev?

11:34:19 <somenerd[m]> I think to a school network
11:34:22 <somenerd[m]> afaict
11:34:23 <rny> ImaR0b0t[m]: please learn how to ask a proper question
11:34:27 <ImaR0b0t[m]> School wifi
11:34:35 <ImaR0b0t[m]> Sorry
11:34:48 <rny> ImaR0b0t[m]: please talk to your local school IT and ask them how to connect to the WiFi

11:34:56 <Device_Manager[m> <strcat[m] "can you show the output?"> Web version won't recognize device
11:35:04 <somenerd[m]> it's probably not a GrapheneOS feature
11:35:42 <somenerd[m]> (entering a domain name)
11:35:55 <rny> ImaR0b0t[m]: sounds like you need to install a certificate to the trust store or something and they strip and replace certificates
11:36:00 <ImaR0b0t[m]> <somenerd[m] "it's probably not a GrapheneOS f"> My other friend with stock Android didnt had to do this. Thats why it confuses me

11:36:42 <rny> ü§∑ maybe your friend installed the requisite certificate to the trust store.
11:36:45 <SaltyKimchi> I'm pretty sure i going to get targeted for saying this lol
11:36:51 <rny> my advice is, dont use the school wifi if you can
11:36:56 <rny> its fkin useless
11:37:08 <rny> probably does more harm than good.
11:37:41 <rny> and do a presentation on why the school wifi suck and present it as a security seminar to your class
11:37:49 <rny> nobody should use it at all
11:38:01 <ImaR0b0t[m]> <rny "its fkin useless"> I know but it sucks with a limited data plan
11:38:23 <rny> anyways, it is offtopic and unrelated to the proper functions of graphene os

11:38:37 <rny> please take it to #grapheneos-offtopic to discuss the security implications of bad school wifi.
11:39:05 <rny> im sure many of our community members have stories to tell about how shit their university/school wifi is and how much spying they had to go thru in the hay days
11:39:07 <somenerd[m]> lol
11:39:24 <ImaR0b0t[m]> <rny "please take it to #grapheneos-of"> Ok
11:39:37 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
11:39:42 <somenerd[m]> for matrix users
11:39:55 <fll[m]> lol, you should always asume that all networks are bad. Not different for school networks
11:40:14 <rny> the school (more broadly) enterprise ones are **particularly** bad
11:40:15 <somenerd[m]> root certs
11:40:21 <rny> because they give you a false sense of security
11:40:29 <rny> and strip/replace certs with their own ones
11:40:32 <rny> to mitm you
11:40:37 <rny> it is insane
11:40:38 <somenerd[m]> oh yeah the passwords are useless as well
11:40:45 <rny> so so bad.
11:40:53 <somenerd[m]> > and strip/replace certs with their own ones
11:40:53 <somenerd[m]> yeah
11:41:03 <somenerd[m]> I think only cert pinning blocks this
11:41:07 <rny> ^ yep
11:41:11 <rny> and the internet will break on you
11:41:13 <rny> LOL
11:41:18 <somenerd[m]> yeah
11:41:30 <SaltyKimchi> <rny "anyways, it is offtopic and unre"> sorry didnt know about offtopic chat
11:41:35 <somenerd[m]> "encrypted traffic that I can't read?"
11:41:37 <somenerd[m]> "not allowed"
11:42:02 <somenerd[m]> anyways, this is offtopic
11:43:00 <rny> ImaR0b0t[m]: tell your friend, their teacher is looking/reading their messages
11:43:24 <rny> or that creepy IT manager is doing so.
11:43:48 <somenerd[m]> unless they use something like signal (cuz there's two layers of encryption and cert pinning)
11:43:51 <somenerd[m]> right?
11:44:26 <somenerd[m]> but they're probably reading all web traffic
11:44:47 <somenerd[m]> and if the school is compromised...
11:45:21 <rny> thinking about it is really gross, with all the indecency that occurs around school/uni these days
11:45:31 <rny> üò®
11:45:43 <rny> and its only the tip of the iceberg
11:46:05 <rny> it is these people that need **good** security/privacy most.
11:46:23 <somenerd[m]> also making a security pres on this may not be a good idea
11:46:49 <somenerd[m]> since the teachers may be mad
11:47:01 <rny> the audience and staff should be aware what kinda risk they are exposing themselves to
11:47:13 <rny> most of the time teaching staff dont even know how wifi works
11:47:19 <rny> its the IT manager that can abuse it
11:48:25 <somenerd[m]> and it's even larger than that
11:48:30 <somenerd[m]> if the root cert gets leaked
11:49:53 <somenerd[m]> basically everything is compromised (even https)
11:50:03 <somenerd[m]> if the cert is still installed on the phone
11:54:08 <wrt[m]> Is the stock Calendar read only?
11:54:37 <wrt[m]> Having a senior moment unable to add an event...

12:46:15 <bearsecured[m]> Pixel 3 still the king :D
12:46:41 <ikhwanarif[m]> Hello everyone. A little backstory. I've been using GrapheneOS for almost a week. I like it and I like what you're doing. I have a question; I've received 2 seamless updates in a row, yesterday and today and I'm wondering if this is normal?
12:47:26 <bearsecured[m]> <ikhwanarif[m] "Hello everyone. A little backsto"> Ye
12:47:31 <rny> ikhwanarif[m]: there was a fix for the network time stuff that i botched.
12:47:37 <rny> you can read the changelog
12:48:18 <rny> when an SSL connection to the time server failed, there was a UX problem that may have caused unix time on your phone to reset to 0.
12:48:54 <rny> to be clear, it is not a security issue and there's nothing to worry about, it was just very bad user experience therefore warranted an immediate fix
12:48:55 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: I'm guessing it got in some weird state where it was halfway through a transaction and didn't want to move on
12:48:55 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: was doing other stuff and missed your progress on it
12:49:01 <ikhwanarif[m]> <rny "ikhwanarif: there was a fix for "> Thank you. Where do I read the changelog? I don't have a computer background.

12:50:18 <rny> m2tu[m]: repo sync again
12:50:19 <ikhwanarif[m]> <rny "ikhwanarif: https://grapheneos.o"> Thank you very much üëçÔ∏è Much appreciated.
12:50:36 <strcat[m]> m2tu: repo sync again, just be aware it might wipe away changes you made depending on how you did them
12:50:37 <rny> ikhwanarif[m]: no prob. sorry for wasting your bandwidth. :/
12:50:38 <m2tu[m]> i did that , but files ar not recovring back
12:50:56 <strcat[m]> m2tu: repo init + repo sync again
12:51:11 <strcat[m]> run `repo status`
12:51:13 <m2tu[m]> ok i try again
12:51:14 <strcat[m]> after doing that
12:51:24 <strcat[m]> if it says there are dirty git repos
12:51:30 <m2tu[m]> if i change my info from repo init email
12:51:35 <strcat[m]> got into them and just do `git reset --hard` if you want to drop pending changes
12:51:54 <rny> ^ üò±
12:51:57 <strcat[m]> but yeah beware you may have changes clobbered by repo sync
12:52:00 <rny> why not `git stash` them
12:52:08 <rny> all that hard work
12:52:09 <strcat[m]> rny: too safe
12:52:39 <m2tu[m]> allright i do a try
12:52:39 <strcat[m]> rny: I see git differently after mostly maintaining downstream patch sets that only make sense to rebase heavily
12:53:12 <m2tu[m]> what happnt if git stash ?
12:53:13 <strcat[m]> rny: git history is doing git commit --amend over and over again and then looking in the reflog
12:53:27 <Device_Manager[m> <strcat[m] "Device_Manager: I'm guessing it "> I ended up trying web version again, it wouldn't detect device, I accidentally hit flash release which was obviously already downloaded.  I looked down and seen unlocking BL message, and said F it, can't get worse .... Followed threw with it and she booted
12:54:02 <strcat[m]> Device_Manager: well as long as it all verifies after locking it
12:54:05 <strcat[m]> must have worked properly
12:54:20 <strcat[m]> wonder what happened
12:54:30 <strcat[m]> I've seen people have it get interrupted halfway through part of it and then it doesn't want to start again
12:54:35 <strcat[m]> cause it says a transaction is pending
12:54:38 <strcat[m]> there's a way to cancel it
12:54:41 <Device_Manager[m> Ya know I didnt check, imma check now
12:55:04 <rny> strcat[m]: what does that mean? RE: git history is doing git commit...
12:55:57 <Device_Manager[m> I'm guessing there isn't anything we can do about the "Loading different Software" message?
12:56:11 <strcat[m]> rny: you know about the reflog right?
12:56:15 <rny> yes
12:56:46 <strcat[m]> rny: so basically the way I tend to use git these days is while working on stuff I repeatedly git commit --amend over and over to make sure all my stuff is saved in the reflog
12:56:48 <strcat[m]> that's what I mean
12:57:00 <strcat[m]> rny: I don't value the actual history very much
12:57:17 <strcat[m]> I value having tons of reflog stuff to find previous bits I discarded while working on it etc
12:57:26 <rny> that's an interesting way to use git
12:58:35 <strcat[m]> rny: you should see how bad git is at handling Chromium's code
12:59:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> I do the same tbh
12:59:26 <strcat[m]> rny: one of the big issues is that git doesn't track renames in history
12:59:45 <strcat[m]> rny: it has to dynamically guess every time you do something like look at log, cherry-pick, rebase, etc
12:59:53 <strcat[m]> rny: and sometimes... it guesses wrong
12:59:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> I keep huge reflog lists and actively switch between those
13:00:01 <strcat[m]> and for chromium it gives up because there are too many files
13:00:09 <strcat[m]> you have to raise the configured limits
13:00:15 <strcat[m]> or it just can't properly work at all
13:00:23 <strcat[m]> it can't properly cherry-pick or apply a patch etc
13:00:33 <strcat[m]> since it won't find renamed files
13:00:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: you mean that merge.renamelimit?
13:00:41 <rny> what about the other VCS?
13:00:44 <rny> mercurial?
13:00:45 <rny> :P
13:00:56 <strcat[m]> even worse
13:01:03 <strcat[m]> hg branches are horrifying
13:01:16 <strcat[m]> I've used svn too
13:02:11 <strcat[m]> rny: I find git pretty unusable with non-linear history
13:02:41 <strcat[m]> rny: it's nice for my own projects where I can have a strictly linear history, no merges, and any set of changes has to be cleanly rebased before cleanly applying it on top
13:03:03 <strcat[m]> and I follow the rule of every commit being supposed to build + work
13:03:17 <strcat[m]> so if stuff is split up into pieces it shouldn't break the build then fix it
13:03:37 <strcat[m]> so then you can actually properly do stuff like bisect
13:03:43 <strcat[m]> but dealing with other's people mess
13:03:47 <strcat[m]> ugh
13:03:50 <strcat[m]> makes me hate git
13:04:08 <strcat[m]> rny: the way OpenBSD is going to use Git is what I like
13:04:38 <strcat[m]> rny: they're going to use a subset of Git via their own tool basically as cvs, lol
13:04:51 <strcat[m]> rny: http://gameoftrees.org/
13:06:25 <rny> lol
13:06:35 <rny> a subset of git is very reasonable
13:06:46 <strcat> rny: they're making their own command with a sane UI
13:06:47 <rny> i cant even remember to use more than a handful of git commands
13:06:54 <strcat> rny: same file format on storage
13:07:03 <strcat> so, it's interoperable
13:07:11 <rny> not accounting for all the riduclous cli flags
13:07:13 <rny> shitz
13:07:38 <strcat> git checkout best command
13:07:42 <strcat> does 20 different things
13:10:24 <rny> strcat: LOL
13:10:26 <Albakham[m]> Since the last grapheneos update, my phone has trouble getting the right time from the network, it keeps setting the date as 01 january 2007
13:10:26 <rny> indeed.
13:10:41 <rny> should be 01 jan 1970
13:10:45 <rny> not 01 jan 2007
13:10:47 <strcat[m]> Albakham: make sure you're on the most recent release
13:10:54 <strcat[m]> Albakham: there was another today
13:11:03 <strcat[m]> should fix the issue with that
13:11:12 <rny> if its 01 jan 2007, it is a different problem completely
13:11:15 <rny> and we need to look at that
13:11:26 <strcat[m]> Albakham: which version are you on?
13:11:50 <Albakham[m]> it's 1970*
13:12:02 <strcat[m]> Albakham: manually set time correctly and update
13:12:03 <rny> Albakham[m]: excellent.
13:12:04 <strcat[m]> it'll fix it
13:12:12 <strcat[m]> Albakham: after updating you can enable network time again
13:12:42 <Albakham[m]> okay, if it's expected then no problem :)
13:13:20 <strcat[m]> Albakham: well it was a known issue we fixed in the next release
13:13:21 <strcat[m]> Albakham: bug in added error reporting code
13:19:36 <Albakham[m]> it's back, thanks ;)
13:23:01 <Leroy> Hi guys, anybody here with some time right now? I'm trying to install GrapheneOS on Pixel 3a, but I cant even get past the flashing bootloader part. I bought a fresh Pixel 3a, updated it completely, to Android 11 and some other updates that were required to have it fully updated. Then booted into fastboot mode. "fastboot flashing unlock",
13:23:01 <Leroy> downloaded and signified all files needed for Pixel 3a. And when I do "./flash-all.sh" nothing happens, also tried doing "sudo "./flash-all.sh"
13:29:29 <neelix> Leroy, adb and fastboot install properly?
13:29:52 <neelix> are you getting output messages or completely nothing?
13:30:07 <Leroy> yes, fastbood version 30.0.5
13:30:36 <Leroy> no output, compeltely nothing, blank terminal after I type in sudo ./flash-all.sh
13:31:12 <neelix> does it recognize your phone? Try doing 'adb devices' and see if you get output
13:32:10 <Leroy> recognizing my device, while device still in fastboot mode?
13:33:38 <AshB[m]1> <Leroy "Hi guys, anybody here with some "> Try using the Web Installer? I did that and it worked like a charm.
13:34:16 <neelix> ah its in fastboot
13:34:32 <neelix> never tried the web installer, but like AshB[m]1 is saying try it out
13:35:16 <Leroy> well yeah, after I do "fastboot flashing unlock" it's supposed to be in fastboot mode when doing ./flash-all.sh, correct?
13:35:39 <Leroy> or should I boot it up to do thee flashing?
13:36:11 <neelix> The bootloader is unlocked i assume?
13:36:55 <Leroy> yes, that worked instantly no problem, but after that, basically the next step doesnt
13:39:11 <Leroy> Ahh, one second, I might have an idea, because unlocking bootloader wipes the phone completely, right? But I unfortuantely rebootet again after unlocking, so maybe USB-debugging needs to be enabled again?
13:42:49 <Leroy> that was it! seems to be running now
13:43:01 <Lighwake[m]> Or you could just try the web installer, it's much easier‚Äîjust click a few buttons and you're done.
13:44:38 <neelix> Good Leroy
13:45:12 <neelix> gave my 3a away, my 4a will arrive in a few days :D

What happens if in that delay I unlock my profile? I did that and expected the initial lock will reappear but it didnt. Also didnt notice any difference in system. So curious what happens here
14:55:24 <Lighwake[m]> Happened to me once. I just swiped back and it disappeared.

15:34:37 <Leroy> Hey guys, it's me again with the Pixel 3a. Unfortunately it only started to look good, but it seems to not be able to flash the device once the flashing script is running. I tried the CLI and the Web-Version now, at some point it just stops running and won't do anything after all.

15:42:12 <delphi11[m]> hi, i have a 3a/4/4a that i use graphene on for basic secure communications.  i was wondering if anyone would be open to answering a question on a sim
15:43:35 <delphi11[m]> my primary comms with my colleagues is signal and xmpp which i have covered via signal/conversations.  right now i tether off of ethernet or a wireless network i control.  but when going mobile i was wanting to use cellular
15:44:07 <delphi11[m]> will an android/grapheneos phone take a data-only sim? i don't need phone/sms capabilities just data.  or would i perhaps have to alter the apn somehow
15:45:49 <delphi11[m]> i have my own asterix system for voice calls if someone needed to reach me, but it's nice not to be tethered on the go, but getting better data pricing with a bit of privacy
15:55:56 <M0n30v3rb04rd[m]> Anyone using voyager exchange without force closing?
16:03:21 <delphi11[m]> i'm thinking that a data-only sim would work, but curious if anyone has done this.  i can get better rates with a pre-paid data sim from an mvno
16:16:59 <TheMadOne[m]> Hi. I want to flash graphene on a pixel 3a but the computer doesnt find the device although its connected to it
16:17:12 <TheMadOne[m]> what can i do?
16:17:44 <delphi11[m]> TheMadOne:  check in the developer options that you have usb debugging turned on and allow trust between your host machine and the phone
16:18:22 <delphi11[m]> of course you'll need to hit the oem unlocking first and the usb debugging by tapping 5x on the about pixel/build number (I believe it is)
16:18:32 <delphi11[m]> then follow the cli guide and it should get you there
16:19:37 <TheMadOne[m]> I did
16:19:50 <delphi11[m]> what is your host system?  windows/linux?

16:44:12 <TheMadOne[m]> Okay
16:44:41 <nscnt[m]> You're in fastboot. It doesn't matter what you've set in the OS.

16:45:22 <Publius> Have you unlocked bootloader yet?
16:45:27 <nscnt[m]>  * You're in the bootloader interface. It doesn't matter what you've set in the OS.
16:45:28 <TheMadOne[m]> Yes
16:45:56 <nscnt[m]> TheMadOne: What do you use now? CLI or WebUSB?
16:46:05 <TheMadOne[m]> Web usb
16:46:12 <Publius> From command prompt, within platform-tools folder, if you issue command "fastboot devices", does the device respond with its serial number?
16:46:33 <nscnt[m]> ^ that's nothing you should do
16:46:41 <Publius> What?
16:46:53 <nscnt[m]> TheMadOne: You were able to unlock the bootloader with the WebUSB?

16:52:57 <Lighwake[m]> The only thing I had done before installing Graphene is update USB drivers on my phone when flashing CalyxOS.

16:54:14 <Lighwake[m]> TheJollyRoger said I'm good to go. If nothing, try that.
16:54:26 <nscnt[m]> TheMadOne: Where are you right *now*? Do you try to install GrapheneOS with the WebUSB or what's your plan?

16:57:38 <TheMadOne[m]> <TheMadOne[m] "i unlocked the bootloader before"> So know i wanted to select download release but the browser said no compatible devices found
16:59:09 <nscnt[m]> TheMadOne: In Windows Update, search for updates now. You might get a tiny link "View optional updates" where you'll find the optional driver updates to get it to work.
16:59:23 <nscnt[m]> I assume you're in the bootloader interface and connected to the pc.
16:59:58 <TheMadOne[m]> <nscnt[m] "I assume you're in the bootloade"> Wait
17:32:51 <filly> info
18:12:09 <zzxx123> Just follow the official instructions ffs
18:13:53 <zzxx123> People following random instructions else where, got screwed, and then write another long piece of text, when they can simply refer to the official instructions.
18:23:49 <Drew> Running windows 10 on a Surface. Having trouble installing graphene on Pixel 4a. When Pixel is connected to laptop normally, it appears and is accessible, so likely not a usb cable issue. Have downloaded and installed platform tools from Android. ADB recognizes phone when on normally (not in fastboot). Fastboot version is correct. But, when I
18:23:49 <Drew> reboot into fastboot, no device is found. Anyone have any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
18:25:56 <nscnt[m]> Drew: First thing: Have you considered using the WebUSB-based installer? Second: The problem you have sounds like a missing driver. If you're in the bootloader interface, check for updates in Windows Updates. You might get a link "View optional updates" where you can download and install the driver for the Android Bootloader Interface.
18:26:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <Drew "reboot into fastboot, no device "> In fastboot mode you should be using the `fastboot` command, not `adb`
18:27:29 <blk_> Drew: while the phone is connected and in the bootloader update the device drivers
18:28:55 <Publius> Drew, I had same problem. In the end, I discovered I needed to use the "ADB Debugging Interface" driver to gain connectivity with the device when it was in fastboot mode
18:29:36 <Publius> BTW, that driver does NOT work when device is fully booted and running on the OS. For that, I need to use "MTP media device" driver
18:31:02 <Publius> Also, just because your cable works to transfer files between PC and device, that does NOT mean the cable can be used to successfully flash... I had that issue, too.

18:35:02 <mrbrownbadger[m]> where can i find  the build for 4a5g?
18:35:24 <Hardbrick> Good morning, afternoon, and goodnight.
18:35:45 <Publius> There isn't a build yet for the 4a5G
18:36:26 <mrbrownbadger[m]> Publius the release note states otherwise
18:36:47 <Hardbrick> @JollyRoger RMA was authorized through google. Getting a refurb.
18:36:57 <Hardbrick> Wanted to update
18:37:01 <Publius> Yeah, just noticed that.
18:37:34 <Hardbrick> Yeah dont flash Sunfish to Brambo! end up hardbricking. OOOppps
18:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hardbrick: glad to hear it's not a writeoff!
18:38:55 <TheJollyRoger> mrbrownbadger[m]: Just because some changes have been made to the underlying code tag in anticipation of a release, it doesn't mean Bramble is ready to reach experimental, much less production yet.
18:38:57 <Hardbrick> Not sure what to do with the device since keeping privacy is important. may just let it sit till there is a release for it
18:39:29 <Hardbrick> Opps yeah Bramble haha
18:40:29 <TheJollyRoger> Hardbrick: make sure to check upon arrival that it's not a Verizon one. Generally refurbished phones lack their original packaging, and the kids being paid eight bucks an hour to sling those phones don't check their SKU numbers even if they do have their original packaging anyways.
18:40:58 <Drew> nscnt[m] Thanks! The driver tip worked!
18:41:03 <Hardbrick> Got it. Will update on that one too.
18:41:06 <TheJollyRoger> You can do this with the adb debugging command "adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid"
18:41:18 <TheJollyRoger> (USB Debugging mode must be enabled)
18:41:40 <TheJollyRoger> If it returns a string of zeroes, there is no carrier ID and the bootloader is unlockable.
18:41:58 <Hardbrick> Write that down!
18:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> If it returns anything but zeroes, then that phone has a carrier ID fused into its write-protected read-only partition, and the phone cannot be unlocked.
18:43:37 <Hardbrick> Hopefully it will be a T-Mobile variant or just unlocked to start with!
18:44:25 <TheJollyRoger> Drew: glad to hear it's working for you. Something to take note of for future reference that could be useful is that most USB cables don't have all the wires they should, only wires for stuff that the majority of users use the device for. This is especially common in OEM cables where they're trying to cut down costs anywhere they can. It may even surprise you, that Google branded cables, while
18:44:27 <TheJollyRoger> they are perfectly suitable for installing the OS, are actually missing at least one wire.
18:46:20 <TheJollyRoger> Since fastboot uses a number of features that aren't common to what most users use, this is why often USB cables and also the ports that they're plugged into, as many motherboard and laptop OEMs do the same with the ports, are the first thing this channel usually ends up suggesting people check.
18:47:09 <Publius> Preach!
18:48:02 <TheJollyRoger> This is often why even after someone has done everything right, sometimes cables will work perfectly for transferring files to the device and charging it, connecting peripherals, but not access debugging interfaces, such as for instance, talk to the bootloader on your phone via fastboot.
18:48:15 <TheJollyRoger> Or the same for USB slots.
18:49:08 <Publius> I'll also add I had a seemingly-good cable that did everything ok, except finishing the flash. It would get about 1/2 way through and eventually fail.
18:49:21 <TheJollyRoger> Publius: oh yikes, jeez, that's the worst case scenario.
18:49:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hope everything went ok for your install!
18:49:43 <Publius> Yep, up and running good!
18:49:50 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear, welcome aboard the ship!
18:50:35 <Hardbrick> Back to work. Will update when the device comes in. Have a good day, afternoon, and night! PRIVACY!!!!!
18:50:49 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, Hardbrick
18:50:57 <TheJollyRoger> Aw darn, too slow.
19:18:33 <AppAraat[m]> https://teddit.net/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/levv4h/copperhead_is_tracking_users_and_manipulating/
19:28:36 <jakewise[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This is often why even after som"> Perhaps this isn't the right forum for suggestions, but outside of the best practice of using the factory cable (likely a USB C to USB C), there are *many* trying to move to GrapheneOS that might not have a laptop with a USB C port.
19:30:35 <jakewise[m]> And, for what it's worth, a big part of *critical mass* (e.g., being able to say to anyone "Oh, you don't have to use iOS or Android. You can use GrapheneOS and do everythign you need to do. And not give up your privacy and security") is ^ those kinds of things.
19:32:21 <jakewise[m]> I guess that's general marketing. And, while you probably wouldn't want me to help with the code base, there is an area (new user onboarding?) that seems to be ripe to be addressed. And I'm happy to contribute
19:34:49 <Publius> jakewise: I fully agree
19:35:54 <Publius> A lot of the folks here are really experienced and really smart - so installation/flashing and stuff is super easy for them. But there's a lot of people, like me, that are not computer techie types, and none of this was that straightforward for my lizard brain
19:36:55 <Publius> The concept of the web installer is awesome, but it didn't work for me.
19:37:49 <Publius> Anything we can do to make GOS easier for non-techies to install would be good.
19:37:55 <nscnt[m]> jakewise: macOS is supported and it's written in the guide.
19:38:32 <Publius> nscnt: he wasn't claiming MacOS was unsupported
19:38:44 <r0tt0r[m]> <Publius "Anything we can do to make GOS e"> thats the point of webinstaller
19:39:20 <Publius> He was saying most people (wrongly) think there are two basic choices for a smart mobile device OS: iOS and Android
19:39:40 <nscnt[m]> Publius: What's the point then? MacOS is exclusive to a Mac.
19:40:00 <jakewise[m]> <nscnt[m] "jakewise: macOS is supported and"> Ok. When I read the Install page > Web USB, it refers to Linux and Win. I asked here and was confirmed that Mac is fine.
19:40:12 <mr_hebi_san[m]> The relentless pursuit of ease is one of the factors that led to the dominance of Windows and Apple.
19:40:24 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I love that you've done as much as you have
19:40:50 <r0tt0r[m]> web installer is fresh so help to make it better and error free apreciated from all sides
19:40:56 <nscnt[m]> "Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS."
19:41:06 * jakewise[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cHfKnrBlceNiNyBNUGsZpBGc/message.txt >
19:41:51 <nscnt[m]> "On Linux, in order for to connect to a device as non-root, the appropriate udev rules need to be set up. This is not an issue on either **macOS** or Windows."
19:42:11 <Publius> I'd love to help improve web installer, but I'm likely unqualified to diagnose issues.. I can report that it was unable to connect to any device - despite my device being connected with proper drivers
19:42:24 <Publius> (which worked fine for the command-line installation procedure)_
19:43:01 <jakewise[m]> <nscnt[m] ""Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Arch"> Yes. I read that. But, there is some context to specific actions that seem to exclude Mac.
19:43:20 <r0tt0r[m]> <Publius "I'd love to help improve web ins"> that is fine, you as a user shouldnt debug. did you try different browsers?
19:43:50 <Publius> Tried it both in Chrome and Brave
19:46:06 <jakewise[m]> <nscnt[m] ""On Linux, in order for to conne"> Again... making things more accessible. That' the point of my comment. This passage is written in the negative not the affirmative.
19:46:08 <Publius> I REALLY don't mean to nitpick, and I'm REALLY grateful to Daniel M and all the other supporters of the GOS project... But constructive criticism would also point out that the official instructions say to "open an instance of powershell". I'm sure that is 1st grade stuff to many of you. But to someone like me, it means nothing
19:47:15 <Publius> So to jakewise's point, that makes GOS less accessible and less "main-streamable" to joe-the-plumber types like me.
19:47:45 <frontman[m]1> Publius: takes less than 1 min of searching to learn about
19:48:09 <jakewise[m]> <Publius "I REALLY don't mean to nitpick, "> I'll join the chorus on your comment.
19:48:14 <frontman[m]1> I've restarted for the latest update twice and it still says to restart. Normal?
19:48:21 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Meanwhile Apple takes 0 searching.
19:48:29 <Publius> frontman: ok, but it is still a hurdle/obstacle for the mainstreaming of the GOS project
19:48:59 <Publius> It's also an issue that there are several youtube videos that are either obsolete, or perhaps simply wrong
19:49:31 <frontman[m]1> Publius: the main hurdle I've found among my friends and family is they don't understand the need to dump google. The ytube vids do suck I agree.
19:49:32 <jakewise[m]> <frontman[m]1 "Publius: takes less than 1 min o"> Again, I believe Graphene is the way. You believe that Graphene is the way.
19:49:32 <Publius> I was considering making my own video aimed at computer dummies like me - but I'm afraid it may too become obsolete and mislead folks in the future
19:49:43 <mr_hebi_san[m]> From my standpoint there's hardly an easier way to do this.  However I'm paid to keep Android Studio on a machine and I known what it does :)
19:49:52 <mr_hebi_san[m]> But I'm not normal.
19:50:29 <Publius> Even getting to this chatroom for help is intimidating/overwhelming to regular joe's
19:50:41 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <Publius "I was considering making my own "> Maybe if you made this video and offered it to the project they could host it on their own page?
19:51:02 <jakewise[m]> <frontman[m]1 "Publius: the main hurdle I've fo"> And, let's be honest, that takes some effort.
19:51:11 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Even if no "influencer" posts it, they still coild have it embedded
19:51:41 <Publius> I'm more than willing to make a video. Production value/quality won't be great, but I'm an engineer and detail oriented - so i believe the content would be good
19:51:43 <TheJollyRoger> jakewise[m]: I've sent in a troubleshooting PR.
19:52:07 <TheJollyRoger> We'll see how this is received.
19:52:17 <r0tt0r[m]> <Publius "I REALLY don't mean to nitpick, "> you can always ask for someone helping, though currently gos tries to cover the webusb install and giving beginner users easy proceed option,
19:53:45 <r0tt0r[m]> but i agree indeed weird that commandline woeks as the webusb should go the same path
19:54:05 <r0tt0r[m]> * but i agree indeed weird that commandline works as the webusb should go the same path
19:54:30 <delphi11[m]> what sim/telco providers do people recommend in the states?
19:55:14 <delphi11[m]> i dont use voice or sms but would like some data to go mobile with my pixel.
19:55:17 <Publius> Now that I'm up and running on GOS, and I've shown to my friends, I believe they'll be purchasing 4a devices soon and I'll have chance to do installation a few more times. I'll try the webinstall again, and make videos
19:55:56 <Publius> I'll gladly offer to the project for them to post - but won't post to YT unless I get the project's buyoff. I DON'T want to mislead anyone in the future with bunk instructions
19:56:06 <jakewise[m]> For the record, this channel is extremely helpful. Just saying that some of the embedded/assumed/discussed knowledge make its way to the projects Install (https://grapheneos.org/install/web) or FAQ (https://grapheneos.org/faq) page.

22:49:27 <strcat> or if it was factory reset already then it's going to ask for it in the setup wizard
22:49:42 <strcat> SwankyBarbecue4[: that's a standard thing when selling a used iPhone or Android phone
22:49:46 <strcat> the account has to be removed
22:49:50 <strcat> or the new owner can't use it
22:50:02 <strcat> due to anti-theft protection from tying it to the account
22:51:42 <SwankyBarbecue4[> I see, so the phone must be unlocked prior to flashing Graphene?
22:52:12 <strcat> SwankyBarbecue4[: OEM unlocking has to be turned on or you can't unlock
22:52:19 <strcat> unlocking is part of flashing GrapheneOS
22:52:28 <strcat> and then after flashing you lock again
22:54:21 <SwankyBarbecue4[> strcat: thanks!
22:54:30 <Device_Manager[m> <SwankyBarbecue4[ "I see, so the phone must be unlo"> Yes

23:01:37 <m2tu[m]> strcat:  is there any way to download files manualy ? like systemUI?
23:01:50 <strcat[m]> I really don't know what you mean
23:01:54 <strcat[m]> use git to undo your changes
23:02:03 <m2tu[m]> can i download the source code of SysteumUI
23:02:05 <strcat[m]> you need to use git within repositories
23:02:15 <strcat[m]> you have it
23:02:16 <strcat[m]> run `repo status` at the top level
23:02:18 <strcat[m]> it will tell you what you've changed
23:02:23 <strcat[m]> go into repositories you've changed
23:02:27 <strcat[m]> if you want to undo all your changes
23:02:52 <strcat[m]> use `git reset --hard` and it will remove all changed files and restore removed ones (won't delete files you created that aren't tracked)
23:03:00 <strcat[m]> you could also check out specific files again etc
23:03:05 <strcat[m]> you need to learn to use git
23:03:20 <m2tu[m]> hmm
23:03:29 <m2tu[m]> so if i go to the dir of systemui
23:03:37 <m2tu[m]> i can try git reset --hard ?
23:04:09 <strcat[m]> run `repo status` at the top level first
23:04:30 <m2tu[m]> how do i do that ?
23:05:33 <m2tu[m]> i did run once and it got stuck in one place
23:05:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> m2tu: system ui source code is in frameworks/base afaik
23:06:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's not in a separate repo like other apps
23:07:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also
23:07:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> ```
23:07:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> repo forall -vc "git reset --hard; git clean -fdx"
23:07:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Cleans up everything
23:07:31 <m2tu[m]> hmm mine is located at frameworks/base/packages
23:09:36 <m2tu[m]> i run this repo forall -vc "git reset --hard; git clean -fdx"repo forall -vc "git reset --hard; git clean -fdx"
23:09:46 <m2tu[m]> thanks so much
23:14:43 <m2tu[m]> anupritaisno1:  the code will cean all changes i made for systemui
23:15:06 <m2tu[m]> or also eveything else so i get clean files now ? its till working
