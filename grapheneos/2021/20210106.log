01:28:10 <lovestory[m]> Hi all
01:28:23 <lovestory[m]> Is that new update gonna be OTA
01:28:42 <thematrix5000[m]> is there a way to make the bottom bar buttons smaller on the back and homepage section
01:29:35 <jonmonty[m]> theOne I just got it over OTA you have to select Beta in update settings
01:31:00 <lovestory[m]> Oh its a beta update?
01:31:14 <lovestory[m]> Any issues so far
01:32:08 <jonmonty[m]> tytydestroi Pixel 5 specs are lower than the Pixel 4 or 4 xl as far as processing speed is concerned. However the battery life for Pixel 5 is much much better and the pixel 4 has a manufacturer defect that cause the battery connector inside to damage itself from normal use cause the phone to shut off randomly and exhibit odd battery behavior.
01:32:59 <jonmonty[m]> tytydestroi my bad I completely missed the fact that you asked specifically about hardware security. They both have the titan M chip so
01:33:50 <jonmonty[m]> theOne I believe it is beta. And I've never had any issue with beta graphene os and I've always used beta over stable for about 6 or 9 months now
01:34:36 <jonmonty[m]> Except that one issue a while back where the clock was optimizing battery usage and it killed my alarm. But that was patched next day thankfully
01:37:29 <Xilophone1588> Hi
01:37:46 <Xilophone1588> How do I upgrade graphene and check my version
01:37:49 <jonmonty[m]> Today's update running great OTA updated and rebooted just fine I like the choice for blue accent color and more dark mode support.
01:37:50 <jonmonty[m]> I'd love to see full dark mode support across apps like contacts and dialer
01:38:26 <Xilophone1588> How do I update, I tap check for updates but nothing appears to happened
01:38:59 <jonmonty[m]> Xilophone1588 open settings go to the bottom open system then click advanced settings then click system update settings tap check for updates.
01:39:07 <Xilophone1588> Yes
01:39:17 <Xilophone1588> I tap it but nothing happens
01:39:21 <jonmonty[m]> Xilophone1588 if you want today's update change to the beta release channel
01:39:29 <Xilophone1588> How do I check my version
01:39:47 <jonmonty[m]> Go to about phone and scroll to the bottom
01:39:49 <Xilophone1588> I'll just wait for stable release
01:40:14 <Xilophone1588> Beta can contain bugs
01:40:20 <jonmonty[m]> Or tap on the android 11 section of about phone
01:40:58 <jonmonty[m]> It could however I've found beta to be very stable. Up to you
01:41:51 <Xilophone1588> It will eventually be pushed into stable right?
01:47:27 <jonmonty[m]> I believe so
01:54:24 <lovestory[m]> Beta update took away that pink wallpaper
01:59:32 <lovestory[m]> Is there a need to use auditor after updates
02:07:02 <rny> pink wallpaper best wallpaper
02:08:16 <TheJollyRoger> lovestory[m]: not strictly speaking. However, Auditor is very nice to have as a bit of extra security, knowing that every couple of hours, your phone can attest to the authenticity of its system partition, and give you a cryptographic assurance that it hasn't been tampered with.
02:09:48 <lovestory[m]>  TheJollyRoger: will remote auditing be suffice? Or will I need to do a local pairing again?
02:10:35 <TheJollyRoger> lovestory[m]: Once you've paired the first time, both Attestation Server and your local device will have saved and pinned the certificate they first saw.
02:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> Remote attestation will ping automatically after a certain amount of time, and warn you if the device fails to check in (or something has changed) after 32 hours. You don't need to do anything else once it's set and ready except have an E-mail address accessible from a device you trust (and preferably, not accessible from the same device that's submitting the attestation data!)
02:11:52 <TheJollyRoger> So it's entirely transparent.
02:13:12 <TheJollyRoger> Local verification is much more secure, but obviously it requires a second device *and* it requires you to go through the fuss and hassle of remembering to do it and scanning the codes yourself, so it's a matter of convenience: using the Attestation server is great because it's entirely transparent and functions without any sort of intervention on your behalf once you've set it up, so I vote to
02:13:14 <TheJollyRoger> keep it going.
02:13:44 <TheJollyRoger> Plus, once you've paired the first time, the certificate is pinned, so subsequent attestations will always be specific to that phone's keys.
02:43:50 <lovestory[m]> Sounds good thanks
02:45:13 <strcat> any issues with the latest Beta?
02:45:19 <strcat> probably pushing out via Stable soon
02:48:50 <rny> no issue since it rebooted
02:49:05 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat "any issues with the latest Beta?"> Timely question. Just noticed something weird.
02:50:51 <organicpumpkin[m> My navigation went back to being the "2 button navigation", so I went into the settings but in there it was still on gesture navigation which I had selected.
02:50:51 <organicpumpkin[m> Fix: tapped on 2 button, then on gesture again and it's back to normal.
02:53:22 <ayaen_t[m]> its been good so far.everything that worked for me before , still works for me .
02:53:38 * organicpumpkin[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/dWjVRbjeXKWHsnHEyYsSrxPU/message.txt >
02:54:06 <strcat> organicpumpkin[m: doesn't seem related to our changes
02:54:18 <strcat> does anyone else have the issue of gesture navigation setting being reverted?
02:54:23 <ayaen_t[m]> i am on a 4a with gesture nav and no such issues
02:54:45 <rny> gesture nav working on my end 3XL
02:54:48 <rny> no change
02:54:55 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: not sure how that would have happened but don't think it has to do with what we changed
02:55:15 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: if it still thought gesture nav was enabled that seems to imply it was still configured
02:55:30 <strcat[m]> maybe a reboot would have fixed it without toggling it again
02:55:32 <strcat[m]> but it's odd
02:55:45 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "OrganicPumpkin: not sure how tha"> Sounds good. The update was the only thing that changed on my end to make it happen, so I thought I would let you know :)
02:55:46 <strcat[m]> did this happen across user profiles?
02:56:04 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "did this happen across user prof"> Yes
02:56:11 <strcat[m]> what I mean is
02:56:14 <strcat[m]> when switching profiles
02:56:20 <strcat[m]> perhaps with different nav configuration across them
02:57:00 <strcat[m]> there are some races when switching user profiles that we've reported upstream and they're fixing it because we framed it in a way that it's a security issue (nothing particularly important but I came up with a good way of reporting it for enterprise device management use cases where they have to prioritize fixing it)
02:57:54 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "perhaps with different nav confi"> So I just switched profiles now, I have 4 in total, my setting is for gesture nav in all 4 before update.
02:57:58 <rny> strcat[m]: must every issue be framed as a security issue to get attention from upstrema?
02:58:06 <strcat[m]> rny: yes
02:58:15 <rny> strcat[m]: how sad
02:58:23 <strcat[m]> alternatively submitting a patch via gerrit which requires fixing it ourselves
02:58:44 <strcat[m]> rny: well that issue tracker is flooded with requests from their billions of users
02:58:54 <strcat[m]> rny: they made it harder to figure out how to report issues which probably helps
02:59:03 <rny> LOL ^
02:59:10 <rny> that's what i was about to say
02:59:18 <rny> you need to jump thru so many hoops just to report an issue
02:59:24 <strcat[m]> if you don't mark it as a security issue it takes a long time for them to even come triage it and they are basically in "assume everyone is an idiot" mode and might misinterpret it
02:59:37 <strcat[m]> and then no guarantee it gets given to any relevant developers or dealt with at all
02:59:44 <strcat[m]> probably no dev ever sees it
02:59:53 <strcat[m]> vs. reporting as security issues they triage pretty fast
03:00:03 <strcat[m]> so I have to come up with a security threat (a real one) from a bug
03:00:20 <strcat[m]> it's good to look at what device managers are supposed to be able to enforce and frame it as an enterprise security issue
03:00:24 <strcat[m]> been trying to do this lately
03:00:58 <strcat[m]> rny: basically reporting it as a security issue gets it fixed in ~60 days and shipped in ~90-120
03:01:06 <strcat[m]> rny: not doing that? uhhh good luck
03:01:10 <rny> linux has billions of users too, they dont seem to have that kinda complex when it comes to dealing with reported issues
03:01:20 <strcat[m]> it takes them maybe 14 days to come triage it
03:01:22 <rny> is this specific to google?
03:01:39 <strcat[m]> linux kernel has no bug tracker at all
03:01:44 <strcat[m]> so that makes things simpler, they just ignore bugs
03:01:55 <rny> :upside_down_smiling:
03:01:55 <strcat[m]> the linux kernel bug tracker is unofficial and basically 99.9% ignored by maintainers/developers
03:02:05 <strcat[m]> you cannot really report a linux kernel bugh
03:02:08 <strcat[m]>  * you cannot really report a linux kernel bug
03:02:19 <strcat[m]> so for example there are at least 2 bugs impacting hardened_malloc
03:02:22 <strcat[m]> a VMA merging bug
03:02:39 <strcat[m]> and also mlockall seems incredibly stupid and tries to lock all of the clean, PROT_NONE mappings it has made to reserve address space
03:02:45 <strcat[m]> causes problems with chrony and cryptsetup so far
03:02:52 <strcat[m]> and what can I do about that?
03:02:56 <strcat[m]> there isn't really a bug tracker
03:03:04 <rny> strcat[m]: you can complain in LKML?
03:03:06 <strcat[m]> I could send an email to an overcrowded mailing list where it gets lost
03:03:17 <strcat[m]> rny: yeah alongside the 10000 messages per day
03:03:18 <strcat[m]> or whatever it is
03:03:31 <strcat[m]> rny: the point is it won't become an issue that is tracked
03:03:42 <strcat[m]> I would have to pick specific people to email that can be considered responsible for it
03:03:49 <strcat[m]> and if it appeals to them as something to work on
03:03:57 <strcat[m]> maybe they take a note of it in some text file on their computer
03:04:00 <strcat[m]> and maybe they fix it one day
03:04:04 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "there are some races when switch"> strcat related to this topic - the biggest issue for me in user profiles is the lack of seedvault backup, any hopes of getting this feature? (https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/332)
03:04:06 <strcat[m]> that's linux kernel bug tracking system
03:04:19 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: you could use adb backup / restore for now
03:04:27 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: we updated Seedvault
03:04:33 <strcat[m]> in the latest release
03:04:39 <strcat[m]> maybe it's available now, maybe it isn't
03:04:45 <strcat[m]> need to talk about that upstream
03:04:55 <strcat[m]> file an issue about user profiles upstream if it still isn't available / working by default
03:05:07 <strcat[m]> there's one about work profiles (link to it in the issue you file to make it clear you're filing it as a separate thing)
03:05:57 <strcat[m]> wish OVH had a better distribution to use for servers
03:06:20 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "maybe it's available now, maybe "> Just checked, still isn't :)
03:06:34 <organicpumpkin[m> <strcat[m] "OrganicPumpkin: you could use ad"> Perfect. I will do that!
03:06:36 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: check upstream issues, file one for user profiles if there isn't one
03:06:42 <strcat[m]> and link to the work profile issue since it's related
03:06:53 <strcat[m]> OrganicPumpkin: we don't want to override the upstream defaults
03:07:08 <strcat[m]> so if it's an experimental / broken setting we probably won't override a default of having it disabled
03:07:13 <strcat[m]> if it's  ready they should enable it by default
03:07:55 <organicpumpkin[m> Sounds good, will do that.
03:10:55 <strcat> annoys me so much that nginx is open core and sticks really important things in the $2500/month PER INSTANCE closed source product
03:11:01 <strcat> $2500/year I mean
03:11:08 <strcat> still bad lol
03:11:19 <rny> strcat: profiteering off open source contributions ;)
03:11:22 <rny> best business model
03:11:33 <strcat> they don't really get (or take, I guess) contributions much
03:11:51 <strcat> the open source project barely has much development at all - and not just because it's quite mature, etc.
03:12:09 <strcat> it has a modular design and most work probably happens in the modules overall
03:12:15 <strcat> including the closed source ones
03:12:32 <strcat> rny: you want to see something hilarious
03:12:35 <strcat> rny: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html
03:12:37 <strcat> open source nginx
03:13:17 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QCGmQWPzJnsfhIuWIXnOoqpd/message.txt >
03:13:33 <strcat[m]> as an example on the releases server right now
03:13:48 <strcat[m]> rny: https://demo.nginx.com/
03:13:49 <strcat[m]> nginx plus
03:13:53 <rny> this is not a paid module is it?
03:13:56 <rny> for something so fkin simple
03:13:59 <strcat[m]> look how pathetic the stats are for the open source one
03:14:06 <strcat[m]> rny: nah I'm saying this tiny stats output
03:14:09 <strcat[m]> is 100% of what you get with open source
03:14:18 <strcat[m]> you cannot get any more stats (aside from log analysis)
03:14:21 <rny> oh lulz
03:14:33 <strcat[m]> you can't check how much memory you're using of things with memory configuration like the conn limit module
03:14:37 <strcat[m]> aside from patching the code I guess
03:14:40 <rny> why dont you use something like traefik?
03:14:42 <strcat[m]> to printf it
03:15:10 <strcat[m]> it would mostly just be nice to be able to check that stuff when under a DoS attack etc
03:15:18 <strcat[m]> rny: https://demo.nginx.com/#shared_zones
03:15:52 <strcat[m]> rny: it would be nice if the open source one just spewed a bunch of stats out here
03:16:08 <strcat[m]> and you needed the product only for the API and fancy UI at least
03:16:14 <strcat[m]> anyway open core is inherently like that
03:16:25 <strcat[m]> it means if you submit patches improving stuff that's part of their product it'll probably just rot away
03:16:35 <strcat[m]> there are popular nginx forks adding stuff
03:16:54 <strcat[m]> rny: don't really care much about the stats
03:17:13 <strcat[m]> rny: the main issue is the `queue` feature for upstream servers (backends) not being available without NGINX Plus
03:17:35 <strcat[m]> rny: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#queue
03:17:46 <strcat[m]> > This directive is available as part of our commercial subscription.
03:18:02 <strcat[m]> rny: you can see that peppered throughout the docs
03:18:50 <strcat[m]> rny: for stats I think they must have code added to core in the closed source one, not just a module, although maybe it can actually hook stuff enough already to do that in a module
03:19:19 <strcat[m]> rny: there are third party modules but I get the impression that there's missing core functionality in the open source one for stuff like this and other things
03:19:34 <strcat[m]> also it seems so silly to need to fork the upstream module into a third party one with that added
03:19:39 <strcat[m]> it's probably 50 lines of code
03:20:01 <strcat[m]> rny: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#resolver_timeout
03:20:09 <strcat[m]> rny: so, how do they decide what to paywall? lol
03:22:10 <strcat[m]> rny: I like nginx but it just sucks that it's open core
03:22:33 <strcat[m]> you can use it as a reverse proxy for email too, thinking about doing that to avoid dealing with postfix and dovecot TLS configuration and it'll protect them from DoS
03:23:26 <strcat[m]> rny: the way they do send timeouts is broken btw, probably the biggest overall issue with it: https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-curious-case-of-slow-downloads/
03:23:42 <strcat[m]> rny: Cloudflare published a patch, unfixed upstream
03:23:59 <rny> i use traefik as a TCP proxy
03:24:06 <strcat[m]> rny: Cloudflare also made a dynamic TLS record patch which helps spin up the connection better
03:24:13 <strcat[m]> not upstream
03:24:32 <strcat[m]> rny: https://istlsfastyet.com/#server-performance
03:25:15 <strcat[m]> rny: I can at least get reasonable *current* connection stats from Linux itself
03:25:42 <strcat[m]> and of course there are the logs
03:39:44 <CanadaisCold1> Hi
03:39:52 <CanadaisCold1> How is the latest update? *Puts on anonymous mask*
03:42:21 <FuchsiaOS_when> Looks fine, and that monthly update was fast
03:43:07 <CanadaisCold1> When is the latest update going into stable release?
03:43:56 <lovestory[m]> Just out of curiosity, the device details that appear on attestation.app, will it cause any problems if they were leaked to anyone?
03:44:24 <CanadaisCold1> It contains device-specific information
03:44:55 <CanadaisCold1> just look at the info and decide
03:45:29 <ayaen_t[m]> CanadaisCold1: it should be as soon as enough people have used beta and dont find anything breaking for them .
03:45:55 <CanadaisCold1> Nice1
03:46:36 <FuchsiaOS_when> Anybody tried TTS now in latest beta?
03:46:48 <ayaen_t[m]> theOne: i sure dont want people knowing that my device failed attestation , assuming that the information is in hands of someone who knows what auditor does
03:47:15 <CanadaisCold1> I think you should just re-install Graphene on a New Computer
03:47:18 <CanadaisCold1> or Reformat your PC
03:47:26 <CanadaisCold1> I find a failed attestation test concerning
03:47:37 <CanadaisCold1> As that should rarely happen
03:47:55 <ayaen_t[m]> you meant from a New Computer right?
03:48:19 <CanadaisCold1> Yeah, thats what I'd do
03:48:26 <lovestory[m]> take_a_deep_breath: solid point lol
03:48:41 <CanadaisCold1> Reformat Graphene, then enable OEM unlock
03:48:52 <CanadaisCold1> On new PC, or reformat current OS
03:50:32 <lovestory[m]> This may be off topic. If I'm using wireguard, do I leave the private DNS on automatic in the OS settings or should I specify the hostname such as quad9?
03:51:09 <strcat[m]> just leave it be
03:51:12 <strcat[m]> use the VPN provided DNS
03:51:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> theOne: do not change it at all
03:51:19 <strcat[m]> automatic is fine
03:51:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Changing it makes you stand out
03:51:25 <CanadaisCold1> Does the VPN over-ride the private DNS settings?
03:51:32 <lovestory[m]> OK thanks
03:51:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> CanadaisCold1: the other way around
03:51:55 <CanadaisCold1> What DNS does the Private DNS user?
03:51:57 <CanadaisCold1> use?
03:52:02 <CanadaisCold1> Id prefer to use my VPNs DNS
03:52:07 <strcat[m]> this is covered in the FAQ
03:52:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> CanadaisCold1: you don't need private dns for a vpn
03:52:10 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: leave it on automatic then
03:52:32 <strcat[m]> there are a bunch of FAQ sections on this
03:52:37 <strcat[m]> it's one of the best covered things in the FAQ by far
03:52:39 <strcat[m]> please read those
03:52:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Private dns just encrypts your queries, something that already happens when you use your VPN's dns
03:53:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember your transport to your vpn provider's dns is encrypted by the vpn already
03:53:14 <CanadaisCold1> yes
03:53:16 <strcat[m]> Private DNS uses DNS-over-TLS, 'Automatic' uses it opportunistically when the network provided servers (including VPN provided servers) have it
03:53:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Private dns is just bad for privacy as it'll make you stand out
03:53:24 <strcat[m]> leave it on automatic to avoid standing out
03:53:35 <strcat[m]> since it's the default
03:53:49 <strcat[m]> it only overrides anything if you set a specific Private DNS server
03:54:08 <strcat[m]> in which case it only uses the network provided DNS to bootstrap connecting to the configured DNS-over-TLS server which it authenticates
03:54:08 <CanadaisCold1> Awesome, thanks.
03:54:20 <CanadaisCold1> "Private dns is just bad for privacy as it'll make you stand out" How so?
03:54:28 <CanadaisCold1> Encrypted DNS is preferable due to encryption
03:54:40 <strcat[m]> benefits and disadvantages covered in the FAQ
03:54:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> <CanadaisCold1 ""Private dns is just bad for pri"> A website can tell what dns you are using
03:55:10 <CanadaisCold1> Yeah but DNS is neccessary
03:55:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's very easy really
03:55:22 <CanadaisCold1> So how is DNS bad for privacy
03:55:30 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: your ISP, etc. still sees all your connections (IP addresses, and generally hostnames due to encrypted SNI being an incomplete standard not generally used - but usually it can be determined from IP anyway)
03:55:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> U wot m9
03:55:35 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: you seem confused
03:55:47 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: read the FAQ sections
03:55:49 <strcat[m]> come back here once you have
03:56:02 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-dns
03:56:46 <CanadaisCold1> Yea just read it, Cloudflare is a pretty FED-ran company
03:56:52 <CanadaisCold1> I'll set private dns to off and just use a VPN
03:57:08 <strcat[m]> we use the network provided DNS like AOSP
03:57:17 <strcat[m]> all we change is the fallback
03:57:52 <strcat[m]> there aren't a lot of public, high availability DNS servers with a reasonable privacy policy to choose from for fallbacks
03:57:56 <strcat[m]> the Quad9 one certainly isn't reasonable
03:57:58 <CanadaisCold1> So even with private DNS mode ON, the DNS queries will be encrypted
03:58:13 <CanadaisCold1> to standard cell carrier?
03:58:19 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: unsure what you mean
03:58:22 <strcat[m]> it's covered in the FAQ
03:58:25 <CanadaisCold1> If I have Private DNS ON
03:58:28 <CanadaisCold1> What DNS is used?
03:58:34 <CanadaisCold1> Carrier set DNS? Encrypted yes/no?
03:58:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "there aren't a lot of public, hi"> Google dns
03:58:50 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: enabling it requires setting a specific server
03:59:02 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: there are 3 settings: automatic, disabled, enabled with a specific hostname
03:59:08 <CanadaisCold1> So Automatic just uses carrier DNS, unencrypted
03:59:09 <strcat[m]> your question isn't about something that you can do
03:59:09 <CanadaisCold1> ?
03:59:14 <strcat[m]> no
03:59:17 <jonmonty[m]> <strcat "probably pushing out via Stable "> No issues at all with beta so far
03:59:19 <strcat[m]> automatic uses network provided DNS
03:59:29 <CanadaisCold1> is that connection encrypted?
03:59:34 <strcat[m]> and upgrades it to DNS-over-TLS when available
03:59:37 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: if that's available, yes
03:59:37 <CanadaisCold1> Ok great
03:59:56 <strcat[m]> it doesn't provide any protection from an active attack since it upgrades it only when available
03:59:58 <strcat[m]> it's covered in the FAQ
04:00:13 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#private-dns-ip
04:00:17 <jonmonty[m]> <strcat "does anyone else have the issue "> Gesture nav on pixel 4xl working fine no changes
04:00:18 <strcat[m]> > By default, in the automatic mode, the Private DNS feature provides opportunistic encryption by using DNS-over-TLS when supported by the DNS server IP addresses provided by the network (DHCP) or the static IP configuration. Opportunistic encryption provides protection against a passive listener, not an active attacker, since they can force falling back to unencrypted DNS by blocking DNS-over-TLS. In the automatic
04:00:18 <strcat[m]> mode, certificate validation is not enforced, as it would provide no additional security and would reduce the availability of opportunistic encryption.
04:00:20 <CanadaisCold1> thanks
04:00:22 <strcat[m]> > When Private DNS is explicitly enabled, it uses authenticated encryption without a fallback. The authentication is performed based on the hostname of the server, so it isn't possible to provide an IP address. The OS will look up the hostname of the Private DNS server via unencrypted DNS and then force all other DNS lookups via DNS-over-TLS with the identity of the server authenticated as part of providing
04:00:22 <strcat[m]> authenticated encryption.
04:00:43 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: when using a VPN, the VPN is the network provided DNS
04:00:51 <CanadaisCold1> Installing Beta update!
04:00:55 <strcat[m]> it will be using the VPN provided DNS servers
04:01:18 <strcat[m]> and presumably those are provided by the VPN on their own network and then query their ISP
04:01:18 <CanadaisCold1> What protection does Graphene OS have, against FBI Malware on Update serverS?
04:01:20 <CanadaisCold1> servers
04:01:29 <strcat[m]> covered in docs

04:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Read the rules please
04:02:22 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: look at the update security section and the other one about releases
04:02:32 <CanadaisCold1> Alright thanks
04:02:37 <CanadaisCold1> What Datacenter is hosting the update server?
04:02:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> CanadaisCold1: please read the rules
04:02:44 <strcat[m]> updates are signed and verified with downgrade protection
04:02:48 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: covered in the 3rd link I posted
04:02:48 <CanadaisCold1> Amazing
04:02:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louipc/grapheneos.org/irc/static/irc-rules.txt
04:03:16 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: an attacker with control of the update server can't ship a malicious update, it will just be rejected since it's not signed with the offline signing keys
04:03:40 <strcat[m]> and they can't ship an old update either since there's a build time check by Updater and update_engine
04:03:53 <CanadaisCold1> Beautiful
04:03:57 <strcat[m]> and verified boot also authenticates all of the images and has downgrade protection itself
04:04:02 <strcat[m]> verified boot validates all firmware and the OS
04:04:53 <strcat[m]> even if an attacker exploits the OS and gains root they can't modify the firmware or OS
04:05:00 <strcat[m]> it'll fail to boot
04:05:11 <ayaen_t[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "https://raw.githubusercontent.co"> what honor system does it refer to ? right at the top its given...
04:06:43 <CanadaisCold1> Awesome

04:07:28 <ayaen_t[m]> <somenerd[m] "and more of expecting people to "> i figurred as much.just asked in  case they had something more specific in mind
04:07:45 <CanadaisCold1> Remote backdoor
04:07:58 <somenerd[m]> no proof of a backdoor
04:07:59 <ayaen_t[m]> CanadaisCold1: clearly you have not been through what anupritaisno1  posted
04:08:14 <somenerd[m]> and yes, go through the rules
04:08:28 <ayaen_t[m]> please do so https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louipc/grapheneos.org/irc/static/irc-rules.txt
04:08:50 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: no evidence / sign of any backdoors and no there isn't something like Intel ME
04:09:41 <strcat[m]> TrustZone firmware is not encrypted or obfuscated and can be inspected as assembly
04:09:47 <strcat[m]> if we were an OEM we would control it
04:09:55 <strcat[m]> not like Intel ME where Intel controls it
04:09:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> When did intel me become a backdoor tho
04:10:03 <strcat[m]> it isn't a 'backdoor'
04:10:13 <strcat[m]> this is offtopic
04:10:51 <somenerd[m]> I think the convo should be stopped here imo
04:11:09 <somenerd[m]> ME is attack surface more than anything
04:11:18 <rny> can we ban CanadaisCold1
04:11:26 <somenerd[m]> no need for that
04:11:43 <ayaen_t[m]> rny: i figured they are new
04:12:12 <strcat[m]> rny: no just leave it be
04:12:13 <somenerd[m]>  * no need for that imo
04:13:17 <rny> surprisingly nobody has suggested that the fabs would install backdoors on SoC along the supply chain
04:13:27 <rny> always the same old parroted attack vectors
04:13:34 <rny> nothing novel/interesting
04:14:09 <rny> happened to trendmicro!
04:14:53 <rny> s/trendmicro/supermicro/
04:15:41 <strcat[m]> once we have more specialized hardware to target, made by a hardware partner
04:15:49 <strcat[m]> it probably still makes sense to support more standard devices to blend in more
04:16:21 <strcat[m]> and that includes it being far less likely that they'd be targeted for that kind of thing than something purchased specifically as a high security device
04:17:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will we have 8k 360fps display on a phone?/s
04:24:51 <CanadaisCold1> "surprisingly nobody has suggested that the fabs would install backdoors on SoC along the supply chain"
04:25:20 <CanadaisCold1> Its called "Supply Chain Compromise" Electronics Hardware Manufacturer implanting tiny hardware rootkit or backdoored firmware
04:25:32 <CanadaisCold1> Its probably how China Hacks most companies, at least, its the most guaranteed
04:25:33 <ayaen_t[m]> CanadaisCold1: i think that was sarcasm
04:25:52 <ayaen_t[m]> and this discussion is already off topic
04:25:59 <CanadaisCold1> a Grain of Rice Sized hardware rootkit implanted within another component, would be hard to detect even looking at the motherboard.
04:26:19 <ayaen_t[m]> whats your point?
04:26:27 <ayaen_t[m]> what do you want us to do?
04:26:43 <ayaen_t[m]> or are you just bored?
04:27:38 <ayaen_t[m]> please do read  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louipc/grapheneos.org/irc/static/irc-rules.txt . we look forward to a stimulating discussion about future grapheneos h/w .
04:28:24 <ayaen_t[m]> not speculation about backdoors.
04:28:50 <ayaen_t[m]> if you have a Proof of one , we are all eager to know.
04:29:54 <banjo[m]> those rules should be posted on channel description. it's the first time I see them.
04:31:02 <banjo[m]>  CanadaisCold1: those are topics for #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:31:56 <banjo[m]> *  CanadaisCold1   those are topics for #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:32:12 <ayaen_t[m]> banjo: i think the off topic room is for discussing privacy security best practices , apps compatibility , and such. sure talk of backdoors even . provided its an informed discussion.
04:33:41 <ayaen_t[m]> im not sure the one  CanadaisCold1:  wanted to have was an informed one .
04:36:57 <strcat[m]> people are free to talk about almost anything in the offtopic channel but based on reality, evidence, etc.
04:37:21 <strcat[m]> so go ahead and talk about how awful x86 is as a platform there and all the bad firmware security and over-engineering / unnecessary complex
04:37:25 <strcat[m]>  * so go ahead and talk about how awful x86 is as a platform there and all the bad firmware security and over-engineering / unnecessary complexity
04:37:31 <strcat[m]> including stuff like Intel ME
04:37:47 <strcat[m]> but don't make claims about stuff being a backdoor without evidence / reasoning
04:38:09 <strcat[m]> and don't repeat talking points, etc. or make claims about stuff without an actual reasoning behind it
04:38:47 <strcat[m]> in general, means you should probably not be talking about most areas of politics, economics, etc. where the entire thing is bullshitting - that's not a good fit for our offtopic channel
04:38:59 <strcat[m]> if a discussion veers off into nonsense it should just be stopped
04:39:08 <strcat[m]> people don't have to be banned for stuff like that
04:39:20 <strcat[m]> banning is for people who deliberately break the rules and don't listen to moderators
04:39:37 <strcat[m]> there is a LOT of leeway for someone that is unintentionally being an annoyance or creating problems
04:40:06 <strcat[m]> but people PRETENDING to be that are going to be quickly caught - and there might be some false positives for banning concern trolls, but so be it
04:42:11 <lovestory[m]> I can see why my dumb questions were seen as trolling now
04:45:46 <strcat[m]> there is a major issue of people coming here and concern trolling
04:46:01 <strcat[m]> it's a concerted, organized effort by 2 hostile communities
04:46:10 <somenerd[m]> 2?
04:46:14 <strcat[m]> yes, 2
04:46:19 <somenerd[m]> which ones?
04:46:23 <somenerd[m]> Copperhead and?
04:47:05 <somenerd[m]> nvm
04:47:22 <strcat[m]> don't really want to talk about it here
04:47:42 <somenerd[m]> fair
05:18:55 <CanadaisCold1> Donate to Graphene OS ! :-)  =-)
05:19:20 <anonhat[m]> About to install on my 4A. When I do, I plan to donate 50 USD.
05:19:38 <CanadaisCold1> Great, Graphene is well worth it! I donated $15 so far, recently.
05:20:09 <CanadaisCold1> set LTE-Only mode if your carrier supports VoLTE, LTE-Only mode makes your phone more resiliant against IMSI catcher, protocol downgrade 2g imsi catcher attacks.
05:21:16 <anonhat[m]> Meh, E2E encryption of voice calls is ideal, but VoLTE helps, yes.
05:22:01 <CanadaisCold1> Yes Signal App is the gold standard
05:22:24 <CanadaisCold1> Today, a majority of the IMSI catchers work by jamming LTE,4G,3G, and spawning a police/fed/hacker controlled 2G basestation.
05:22:43 <CanadaisCold1> Because most Phones are set to networking mode automatic, phones will lost LTE, and connect to the 2G
05:23:08 <CanadaisCold1> So LTE only mode, means you'll just lose signal when LTE is jammed, and WONT connect to the 2G basestation =-)
05:23:13 <CanadaisCold1> Its beautiful
05:23:51 <CanadaisCold1> If you need installation assistance, just ask
05:23:56 <CanadaisCold1> I've installed Graphene OS 3+ times
05:24:57 <CanadaisCold1> Has Graphene looked at FreePhone hardware
05:25:03 <CanadaisCold1> Or PinePhone
05:25:05 <CanadaisCold1> As a base for Graphene
05:25:19 <CanadaisCold1> I think the Google Titan M security chips are unique to google,
05:25:37 <CanadaisCold1> But perhaps an open source variant of Titan M, secure boot etc can be coded using signature matching/validation and verification.
05:27:01 <strcat> CanadaisCold1: we have answers to this elsewhere
05:27:32 <strcat> CanadaisCold1: no, we won't support insecure hardware, and the firmware and hardware components are not open on those
05:27:53 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
05:28:00 <strcat> we require that devices meet our security requirements
05:28:19 <strcat> CanadaisCold1: the Titan M is far from the only secure element, we have no specific dependency on the Titan M
05:28:42 <CanadaisCold1> Thanks for Graphene =)
05:28:49 <CanadaisCold1> What are the future of Graphene OS looking Like?
05:30:49 <strcat> we would be interested in an *actual* open hardware device *meeting the security requirements* and ideally exceeding them
05:31:07 <strcat> in response to the earlier thing, not your most recent question
05:31:09 <CanadaisCold1> Maybe you can design it
05:31:17 <CanadaisCold1> And start a patrion
05:31:19 <strcat> we want to work with a hardware partner that has aligned goals
05:31:26 <CanadaisCold1> Ask Purism maybe
05:31:28 <strcat> no
05:31:31 <strcat> they don't have aligned goals
05:31:46 <strcat> CanadaisCold1: you keep bringing up things that you've previously been told are inappropriate
05:31:46 <CanadaisCold1> You may have to be the intelectual figurehead
05:31:51 <strcat> you're doing the thing about LTE only mode again
05:31:56 <CanadaisCold1> Im just trying to help
05:32:24 <CanadaisCold1> Yeah telling a new graphene user the security benefits of LTE only mode, should be fine, Im talking about the OS feature set :O  But ok Ill lurk in off-tipic
05:32:28 <strcat> it's not helpful to propose we work with people who propagate misinformation and have done substantial harm to the industry
05:32:34 <anonhat[m]> I'm getting together some capital to hopefully develop a decent phone with an Open Titan based security chip. It's still an early project, but I'll likely come back here with updates once something materializes.
05:32:51 <CanadaisCold1> A crowdsourced funding may work
05:32:53 <strcat> the secure element is one piece of puzzle
05:33:02 <CanadaisCold1> Tor-ROuters got hundereds of thousands of $
05:33:05 <CanadaisCold1> yes
05:33:20 <strcat> what we'd want for an initial generation device is launching it with a new Qualcomm SoC to have 4 years of support and current generation hardware mitigations / hardening
05:33:21 <CanadaisCold1> I think lots of people would donate to a 'secure phone' project
05:33:32 <strcat> a secure element that's comparable to the Titan M and provides Weaver, StrongBox and the other features
05:33:33 <CanadaisCold1> Basically the Pixel but open source?
05:33:43 <strcat> it's not realistic to make an open hardware phone
05:33:44 <CanadaisCold1> Maybe ask google for an open source variant?
05:33:51 <CanadaisCold1> ok
05:33:54 <strcat> an ARM SoC phone is not going to be open
05:33:57 <strcat> it's not possible
05:33:58 <anonhat[m]> I'm taking a gradual approach due to the high cost of hardware development. I want to eventually re-implement everything, including with a custom RISC-V SoC and IOMMU sandboxable open source baseband.
05:34:13 <strcat> it's not realistic to make a custom RISC-V SoC meeting all the requirements and security standards right now
05:34:21 <anonhat[m]> And I agree, I'm targeting Snapdragon 700-800 series SoCs currently.
05:34:22 <strcat> not just a CPU but a full blown SoC
05:34:25 <strcat> have to start gradually
05:34:28 <strcat> and incrementally improve things
05:34:42 <strcat> simply *meeting* the hardware security standards set by Pixels for a generation 1 device
05:34:43 <CanadaisCold1> Is the Pixel 4a Baseband open source/secure ?
05:34:44 <strcat> is a high bar
05:35:03 <bentley> different questions
05:35:05 <strcat> CanadaisCold1: it's quite secure, especially relative to the other options
05:35:11 <bentley> "is it open source?" "is it secure?"
05:35:22 <strcat> CanadaisCold1: there isn't an open source baseband for production use in a phone
05:35:30 <strcat> there isn't an open source SoC for production use in a phone
05:35:43 <CanadaisCold1> Wow , the baseband should be open source..
05:35:43 <strcat> so the answer to whether either is open is no, regardless of which phone you ask about
05:35:48 <anonhat[m]> Like I said, I'm taking a gradual approach. The short term roadmap includes an open source security module, open board design, and hardware killswitches for mic/camera/etc. Long term, more custom silicon developed in an open source manner is my plan. But I need a lot of capital to make that happen. So it's not going to happen quickly.
05:35:52 <strcat> it isn't open source for any smartphone
05:35:54 <strcat> neither is the CPU
05:35:57 <strcat> or GPU
05:35:58 <CanadaisCold1> How many Baseband manufacturers are there? Maybe we can ask
05:35:59 <strcat> or other components
05:36:08 <strcat> they aren't going to make you an open source baseband based on your asking
05:36:16 <CanadaisCold1> I mean its the same code, just readable
05:36:19 <CanadaisCold1> Compared to obfuscated
05:36:23 <strcat> there are essentially 0 open source chips used in any smartphone
05:36:49 <anonhat[m]> No, you have to develop your own open baseband. OsmocommBB exists, but there are several reasons why it's a bad idea to use as a basis for an open baseband project.
05:36:56 <strcat> I don't think there's any existing open source secure element available
05:37:03 <strcat> Trezor is developing one (they don't use a secure element right now)
05:37:24 <anonhat[m]> OpenTitan is inspiring. Still a lot of work to do though.
05:37:36 <strcat> Open Titan project is developing one (Google is part of that, and it will presumably replace their existing Titans across platforms)
05:37:43 <strcat> yeah
05:37:53 <strcat> anonhat[m]: and doesn't appear to have an implementation of the Android APIs
05:38:01 <bentley> even targeting components with foss firmware would be difficult enough, compared to actual open source chips
05:38:03 <rny> strcat: open source secure element -- https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox02-firmware?
05:38:07 <strcat> StrongBox, Weaver, verified boot / bootlocker lock state integration, insider attack protection
05:38:33 <strcat> rny: that's a partly open source hardware wallet, not an open source secure element
05:38:41 <strcat> the secure element and main SoC are both closed source
05:38:51 <strcat> there's a difference between running open source code on closed hardware and open hardware
05:39:53 <strcat> rny: so for example, the Pixel 2 code that ran on the secure element was open source
05:40:00 <strcat> rny: but it was a proprietary, off the shelf NXP chip
05:40:19 <strcat> rny: so it wasn't open at all, really, the only thing that was open was the code run on it for Pixels
05:40:42 <strcat> similar to AOSP being open source but nearly any hardware you could run it on not being open
05:41:04 <CanadaisCold1> Strcat, what Operating System for Laptops do you reccomend for base, maximum security?
05:41:12 <CanadaisCold1> Arch Linux With Firewall and Snort IDS?
05:41:16 <strcat> it's offtopic and not something I want to talk about
05:41:18 <somenerd[m]> offtopic
05:41:33 <anonhat[m]> Once I get everything together, I want to work closely with the Graphene devs on this. Probably even arrange some sort of donation or sponsorship program. The key is to get a good foundation of developer support in order to sustain an ecosystem around GrapheneOS.
05:42:42 <CanadaisCold1> Perhaps start a patrion or crowdsourced funding
05:45:21 <anonhat[m]> I'm day trading to raise the capital right now. So far I have ~$100k after a few months of it. The goal is ~1.5 million USD, with possible pre-order campaign to raise additional funding. But I want to get plans together for a decent hardware platform now, and start working on the best/tightest integration with GrapheneOS possible.
05:47:00 <squarmkt[m]> Interesting strategy, but I like it
05:49:48 <rny> anonhat[m]: good luck
05:59:59 <methodman[m]> I just installed grapheneOS on a new 4a. I had previously had it for over a year on a 3xl. I followed the instructions using arch. The only way I could get graphene on the phone was to enable USB debugging. However it is not in the instructions
06:00:05 <methodman[m]> Did I do something wrong?
06:00:40 <strcat> methodman[m]: yes, did something wrong
06:00:50 <strcat> USB debugging is only for the OS, has no impact on fastboot
06:00:53 <strcat> USB debugging is adb
06:00:58 <strcat> which is not used for the installation process
06:01:15 <strcat> methodman[m]: what issue did you have? did you have trouble with the button combination to boot to the bootloader menu?
06:01:21 <strcat> that's the only thing you could possibly do with adb
06:01:55 <methodman[m]> I OEM unlock. Then boot to bootloader. Fast book unlock phone.
06:02:05 <methodman[m]> Then try to run the flash file and nothing
06:02:28 <strcat> methodman[m]: USB debugging wouldn't have any impact on that
06:02:34 <methodman[m]> Then I boot into google os and USB debugging . then to bootloader and flashed fjne
06:02:36 <strcat> it's a toggle for the OS to enable adb
06:02:41 <strcat> it has absolutely no impact on that
06:02:47 <strcat> so yes, you did something wrong
06:02:59 <strcat> maybe you were using an unreliable USB cable or didn't have the driver on Windows
06:03:12 <strcat> what you think resolved the issue is not what actually resolved it
06:03:38 <strcat> similar to how people install an update and then notice a problem for the first time that they already had and associate it with the update
06:03:41 <strcat> but in fact it usually isn't
06:03:52 <strcat> just because you did that before you resolved it
06:03:56 <strcat> doesn't mean it was the solution
06:03:59 <methodman[m]> So I got graphene installed. Should I try again? I am using arch Linux and followed the instructions for fastboot and the Dev download
06:04:05 <strcat> the solution may have been more snugly attaching the usb cable on either end
06:04:16 <strcat> or maybe Windows had time to fetch a driver update automatically
06:04:47 <strcat> methodman[m]: you could try again if you really want but as long as it's locked it's a proper installation
06:04:56 <strcat> methodman[m]: it's just not necessary to enable USB debugging
06:05:06 <strcat> and if you weren't on Windows it wouldn't have been driver-related
06:05:18 <strcat> so just about the only possibilities are related to broken USB
06:05:19 <methodman[m]> <strcat "methodman: you could try again i"> OK thanks! I will try again for fun and switch my USB slot/cable
06:05:42 <strcat> methodman[m]: on Arch Linux, you just need android-udev + android-tools and fastboot
06:05:51 <strcat> adb / USB debugging aren't used / useful anywhere
06:06:15 <strcat> the only reason you might use adb / USB debugging (which just means enabling adb on the device) is for 'adb reboot bootloader' rather than holding volume down while booting
06:06:31 <strcat> but even if someone has trouble with holding power + volume down and releasing power first as soon as it boots to the menu
06:06:39 <strcat> they can just hold volume down + plug in the device
06:06:56 <strcat> since what actually triggers booting to the bootloader menu is holding volume down when booting - either via power or plugging in
06:07:18 <methodman[m]> <strcat "methodman: on Arch Linux, you ju"> All I downloaded with pacman was the 2 things you have on the site. I'll try the install again just to see where I fucked up.
06:07:32 <methodman[m]> Just to confirm I run the flash file on the bootloader screen?
06:07:32 <strcat> methodman[m]: I don't think you screwed up
06:07:35 <strcat> I think your USB port just sucks
06:07:51 <methodman[m]> <strcat "I think your USB port just sucks"> Haha very likely even though it is OEM
06:07:53 <strcat> methodman[m]: try turning your computer off and on again 1st
06:08:00 <strcat> for real
06:08:02 <strcat> may fix it
06:08:05 <strcat> not reboot
06:08:08 <strcat> power off
06:08:09 <strcat> wait 5s+
06:08:11 <strcat> power onb
06:08:18 <strcat> otherwise lots of components won't lose power and actually reset
06:08:35 <methodman[m]> <strcat "otherwise lots of components won"> OK good idea
06:08:43 <strcat> you know lots of modern cables
06:08:47 <strcat> actually have little computers in them
06:08:48 <methodman[m]> Fuck is graphene faster on the 4a. The 3xl was much slower
06:08:53 <strcat> some even with something that can be considered an OS
06:08:56 <methodman[m]> And thanks for the work!
06:09:07 <strcat> apple has a video adaptor cable that runs a version of iOS
06:09:17 <strcat> and updates itself from the Mac you attach it to
06:09:23 <strcat> it does on the fly video re-encoding
06:09:25 <strcat> inside the cable
06:09:37 <strcat> USB cables are also more fucked up than you might realize
06:09:49 <anonhat[m]> Like the O.MG cable...
06:09:50 <strcat> I would say *most* USB cables are broken / not to spec
06:10:13 <methodman[m]> <strcat "some even with something that ca"> I always kill power(unplug) when done with computer and put laptops/phones in Faraday bags when not in use. Just because!
06:10:42 <Knull[m]> <methodman[m] "Fuck is graphene faster on the 4"> it's fast on my 4xl too
06:10:54 <strcat> look at https://twitter.com/nyan_satan/status/1155148789977636864
06:11:05 <strcat> and you'll start to understand why cables / USB hubs are so fucked up
06:12:38 <methodman[m]> <strcat "and you'll start to understand w"> Jesus! That is fucked. Something ape would do for sure
06:12:51 <methodman[m]> How do we avoid all this sneaky shit?
06:13:18 <methodman[m]> <Knull[m] "it's fast on my 4xl too"> I may get that phone for the wife, that is if I can convince her to run GrapheneOS
06:13:45 <strcat[m]> methodman: just giving an example
06:13:53 <strcat[m]> of how cables can be a lot more complicated than people realizing
06:13:57 <strcat[m]>  * of how cables can be a lot more complicated than people realize
06:14:15 <strcat[m]> they need to use the right kinds of resistors etc. and often don't
06:14:19 <strcat[m]> lots of different kinds of problems
06:14:46 <strcat[m]> standard USB-C cables have 2 different sets of connections but only 1 set of cables running through them
06:14:57 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to figure out which connections it should be using based on the orientation
06:15:27 <methodman[m]> Is there a USB cable that is recommended? OEM cables good or is there something better?
06:15:34 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/beaugunderson/status/1132520255325007872
06:15:42 <CanadaisCold1> I just use a high quality USB A to USB C Cable
06:16:00 <strcat[m]> methodman: the ones that comes with Pixel phones are high quality - both the adaptors and USB-C cables
06:16:06 <strcat[m]> you can get high quality cables elsewhere
06:16:12 <strcat[m]> don't buy cheap ones from unknown brands
06:16:18 <strcat[m]> major brands often screw it up too
06:16:29 <strcat[m]> you really don't want to buy a cheap USB-C cable
06:16:35 <strcat[m]> it's actually dangerous due to fast charging
06:16:37 <strcat[m]> it's a fire hazard
06:16:39 <anonhat[m]> I wonder... has anyone tired to use hardware 2FA keys with grapheneOS via USB? Like a FIDO/U2F key?
06:17:03 <strcat[m]> anonhat:  they work, the issue is that for U2F/FIDO2 most apps use Play services to implement it
06:17:06 <strcat[m]> but they can do it without it
06:17:20 <strcat[m]> using the devices from an app for other things works finer
06:17:21 <anonhat[m]> Does Vanadium work?
06:17:24 <strcat[m]>  * using the devices from an app for other things works fine
06:17:30 <strcat[m]> no we haven't reimplemented it in another way
06:17:34 <strcat[m]> help wanted
06:18:37 <methodman[m]> May be a dumb question but can I go usb-c to usb-c for install?
06:19:08 <methodman[m]> Never mind read the top of the page
06:19:14 <methodman[m]> I will use c to c
06:19:30 <anonhat[m]> I've heard of people having issues with USB-C to USB-C. But it was probably due to a bad connector on the laptop.
06:20:23 <strcat[m]> if you use the cable that comes with the phone
06:20:37 <strcat[m]> you know that at least the problem is extremely unlikely to be the connection to the phone or the cable itself
06:20:43 <CanadaisCold1> I used a USB A to USB C cable, Anker Brand, it worked =)
06:20:45 <strcat[m]> I have a bunch of those cables since I have a bunch of those phones
06:21:01 <strcat[m]> I have some Anker USB-C to USB-A cables that work properly
06:21:08 <strcat[m]> most other USB-C cables I have encountered do not work properly
06:21:29 <strcat[m]> I have a infrared camera with a particularly broken one as a charging cable
06:21:52 <methodman[m]> Again thanks to the Devs!
06:21:55 <strcat[m]> it melted a bit when I used it to attach a phone
06:21:59 <strcat[m]> by accident
06:22:05 <methodman[m]> Oh and fuck copperhead
06:22:05 <strcat[m]> (it looks like the other cables I use)
06:22:41 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend avoiding cables that come with most phones - they're often not standards compliant
06:22:50 <strcat[m]> and are actually dangerous to use as standard USB-C cables
06:22:53 <strcat[m]> they're a fire hazard
06:22:56 <strcat[m]> for real
06:23:10 <strcat[m]> the Pixel ones are standards compliant and can be used for other things
06:23:11 <CanadaisCold1> yes
06:23:22 <strcat[m]> other than that, get expensive overpriced stuff that's widely used and tested
06:23:40 <strcat[m]> because of fast charging particularly
06:23:44 <strcat[m]> you don't want a non-spec cable
06:23:49 <anonhat[m]> If it's the only shit that works, maybe it's not overpriced...
06:23:50 <strcat[m]> they cut corners and use the wrong resistors etc.
06:23:54 <strcat[m]> or really bad wires
06:24:16 <strcat[m]> anonhat: well it is overpriced but the problem is you can't really tell which cables are properly made / spec compliant
06:24:30 <strcat[m]> so the easy way to deal with that is buying a widely used, well reviewed Anker cables or whatever
06:24:33 <strcat[m]> bear in mind though
06:24:39 <strcat[m]> Anker has released non-spec-compliant cables
06:24:48 <strcat[m]> I am not really recommending Anker specifically
06:25:03 <Knull[m]> <anonhat[m] "If it's the only shit that works"> lol true
06:25:13 <strcat[m]> there used to be someone who reviewed USB cables on amazon with proper testing equipment
06:26:02 <anonhat[m]> I got a j5 USB C cable a while back and it seems fine. I think I paid ~$20 US for it. 6 ft. Never heard of the brand, though.
06:28:28 <strcat[m]> oh also worth noting
06:28:33 <strcat[m]> Amazon has huge issues with counterfeits
06:28:42 <strcat[m]> you can buy from the company itself like Anker on Amazon
06:28:44 <strcat[m]> and get a counterfeit b
06:28:47 <strcat[m]>  * and get a counterfeit
06:28:52 <strcat[m]> because of how Amazon handles the stock
06:29:03 <strcat[m]> Amazon mixes stock for the same item between different vendors
06:29:11 <strcat[m]> there may be 15 vendors for a given item
06:29:20 <strcat[m]> Amazon will fulfill your order from stock provided by any of the 15 vendors
06:29:24 <strcat[m]> they don't care which one you bought it from
06:29:30 <strcat[m]> just something to be aware of with Amazon in general
06:29:43 <anonhat[m]> Avoid Amazon counterfeiting by only buying items stocked and sold directly by Amazon. Don't buy an item that isn't exclusively sold by Amazon. And while you're at it, use Amazon Smile to support the EFF.
06:29:44 <strcat[m]> if the closest one is from the sketchy counterfeiter, that's what they ship you
06:30:02 <CanadaisCold1> "kust something to be aware of with Amazon in general" thanks mate =-)
06:30:08 <strcat[m]> it is possible for a vendor to use Amazon's own labelling system for products
06:30:14 <strcat[m]> and then they won't mix their stock with other vendors
06:30:22 <strcat[m]> if they don't specifically label things with Amazon labels
06:30:27 <strcat[m]> i.e. they just use the standard box the product comes in
06:30:39 <CanadaisCold1> Yes, I suspected as much =-)
06:30:40 <strcat[m]> then Amazon mixes it with stock from all vendors offering the item
06:30:43 <entry1[m]> <strcat[m] "just something to be aware of wi"> Good point. Could purchase at Best Buy and get them to match Amazon's price
06:31:15 <strcat[m]> so for example, consider a hardware wallet for Bitcoin sold via Amazon
06:31:19 <strcat[m]> a third party can start selling them
06:31:22 <strcat[m]> and they can backdoor them
06:31:29 <strcat[m]> and the stock they provide will be mixed with the other vendors selling it
06:31:34 <strcat[m]> so even if you buy it from another vendor
06:31:38 <strcat[m]> you can get a counterfeit one
06:31:46 <strcat[m]> through no fault of the vendor you bought it from
06:32:14 <strcat[m]> the 1st party vendor of a product is able to opt-in to using special Amazon labels which avoids having their stock mixed with other vendors
06:32:25 <strcat[m]> but a third party vendor can't do that
06:32:35 <strcat[m]> so all third party vendors are at the mercy of others when it comes to this
06:32:49 <entry1[m]> Ebay sellers are selling empty wallets to unsuspecting xbt newcomers and drain their wallets once they get a balance since they have the seed phrase. Its disgusting
06:32:49 <strcat[m]> you can buy from vendor C and get a counterfeit from vendor F through no fault of vendor C
06:33:05 <strcat[m]> thanks to how Amazon fulfills orders
06:33:18 <strcat[m]> so something to keep in mind with stuff like cables that are heavily counterfeited
06:33:25 <strcat[m]> you may think you got a high quality cable
06:33:36 <strcat[m]> and got some non-spec-compliant garbage in a box made to look official
06:33:36 <CanadaisCold1> Can you link to some known hardware wallet sellers?
06:33:39 <CanadaisCold1> Entry
06:34:00 <CanadaisCold1> Thats good to know, thanks
06:34:11 <somenerd[m]> what
06:34:11 <entry1[m]> OT
06:34:16 <entry1[m]> Or dm
06:34:17 <somenerd[m]> is the bridge bugged?
06:34:25 <strcat[m]> somenerd:  Matrix is always broken
06:34:31 <strcat[m]> it would surprise me if it was working properly
06:34:34 <strcat> test
06:34:38 <strcat[m]> seems fine atm
06:34:46 <somenerd[m]> it worked?
06:34:55 <strcat[m]> yes I see the messages I send via Matrix on IRC
06:34:56 <somenerd[m]> > Entry
06:34:56 <somenerd[m]> this message was before entry's
06:35:00 <strcat[m]> and messages I send on IRC via Matrix
06:35:10 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it has substantial lag and doesn't reorder things based on actual time
06:35:29 <ayaen_t[m]> true
06:35:30 <strcat[m]> somenerd: also try refreshing, Element has a broken UI and sometimes reorders messages
06:36:05 <ayaen_t[m]> has it got do with their ui or the protocol itself?
06:36:22 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath: the element issue I'm talking about is just a UI bug
06:36:26 <strcat[m]> fixed by refreshing
06:36:30 <ayaen_t[m]> ok
06:37:00 <strcat[m]> the way the protocol works, it is possible to get messages in different orders
06:37:05 <somenerd[m]> yeah matrix is bugged
06:37:13 <strcat[m]> and the sent date isn't what is used to order it since that can be forged
06:37:18 <somenerd[m]> it feels like it's in beta
06:37:18 <strcat[m]> it orders it based on when you receive it and it's federated
06:37:24 <CanadaisCold1> Does anybody have statistics on how widespread VoLTE is working in usa?
06:37:37 <strcat[m]> well I guess when your home server receives it
06:37:56 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: it's broadly offered but generally requires carrier phones or at least their carrier bloat on your phone
06:38:28 <strcat[m]> CanadaisCold1: VoLTE mostly don't work with GrapheneOS in the US, we'll have it working nearly everywhere else in the next release with CarrierConfig configurations from the stock OS
06:38:46 <strcat[m]> the carriers really need to stop requiring their bloatware remote management apps
06:38:51 <strcat[m]> they like to be able to change some of your settings
06:39:08 <strcat[m]> basically, the way they see things, if you use their network, they get to sysadmin your phone
06:39:11 <CanadaisCold1> VoLTE works for me with Graphene On Simple Mobile/Tmobile network
06:39:23 <strcat[m]> T-Mobile is one of the few sane options though
06:39:28 <CanadaisCold1> Nice
06:39:37 <CanadaisCold1> 60 Gigs of LTE high speed for $50, best data package ive found
06:39:41 <strcat[m]> Sprint (which thankfully is being killed off due to the T-Mobile merger) is totally broken for GrapheneOS, doesn't work at all
06:39:56 <strcat[m]> Verizon has a lot of missing functionality that requires their bloatware apps
06:40:09 <CanadaisCold1> What are the best mobile carriers in your experience?
06:40:34 <strcat[m]> Sprint requires a remote management app (in a sense it's a backdoor but it can't do anything, just mess with certain network settings, etc.)
06:40:38 <somenerd[m]> T-mobile (according to the previous message)
06:40:41 <strcat[m]> to even activate on their network
06:40:56 <entry1[m]> Seems like GSM is the way to go. No issue with any of their MVNOs
06:41:05 <strcat[m]> T-Mobile works well in the US
06:41:11 <strcat[m]> Verizon requires bloatware to fully work
06:41:23 <strcat[m]> and their MVNOs often seem to have broken configuration setups
06:41:27 <strcat[m]> and it's hard for us to fix
06:41:36 <strcat[m]> because we can't simply copy the stock configurations when they depend on bloatware apps
06:42:04 <strcat[m]> so in our CarrierConfig changes, we're omitting the Verizon / Verizon MVNO configurations via the script including the configurations
06:42:07 <strcat[m]> because they depend on apps we don't have
06:42:13 <strcat[m]> and we don't know what subset of the configuration is tied to the apps
06:42:23 <strcat[m]> so for example if we enable VoLTE without the apps
06:42:26 <strcat[m]> maybe it breaks completely
06:42:43 <strcat[m]> it's so stupid that they don't just use standard protocols
06:42:53 <CanadaisCold1> Perhaps email them
06:43:12 <entry1[m]> That would be such a shame if they push out bloatware for T-Mobile. They are getting absolutely huge now and gaining market share. Luckily they seem very consumer conscious and busy with other projects as well. Plus they can see the shortcomings of Sprint
06:43:30 <methodman[m]> strcat who is a good provider in Canada? Or is there one?
06:43:53 <methodman[m]> Also used the pixel USB cable and install went as per instructions. Thanks
06:44:27 <CanadaisCold1> Just to confirm, T-MObile VOLTE works 100% for me in USA
06:44:32 <CanadaisCold1> And I live in a small town
06:44:41 <CanadaisCold1> with Graphene
07:06:27 <ctrl> hi, how can i disable automatic updates for grapheneos on my pixel?
07:08:34 <strcat> ctrl: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-disabling
07:09:05 <strcat> ctrl: note that it means you won't be notified of them at all since there isn't a separate toggle for that atm
07:09:20 <strcat> you can enable it when you want to update
07:09:34 <ctrl> thank you
07:10:06 <strcat> there are different things people might want: still checking and notifying but not downloading + installing, or maybe just not installing
07:10:10 <strcat> atm we keep it simple and it's on or off
07:10:17 <strcat> less that can go wrong
07:11:26 <strcat> going to build perhaps the final Pixel 2 / 2 XL release right now
07:11:58 <strcat> unless people are interested in stepping up to maintain non-officially-supported extended support that's strongly recommended against
07:21:45 <ctrl> strcat, are you expert in coding android/java?
07:22:12 <strcat[m]> in a lot of areas, sure
07:22:17 <strcat[m]> not for making UIs
07:28:36 <hazel[m]> is changing the accent color back to green an option
07:28:58 <hazel[m]> it's a nitpick, just happened to think the green looked nice :p
07:30:54 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hazel[m] "is changing the accent color bac"> Not really
07:30:55 <hazel[m]> figured as much lol
07:31:29 <nux> Just rebooted after the latest update and getting, "Private DNS server cannot be accessed" when activating ProtonVPN. Private DNS is pingable and indeed provides name resolution as normal with no VPN active. Any thoughts?
07:32:00 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/133
07:32:00 <hazel[m]> ah there you have it then
07:32:01 <FuchsiaOS_when> Dynamic themes are incompatible with more secure and private app spawning model
07:33:06 <hazel[m]> well aware the point of GrapheneOS isn't customization
07:33:50 <nux> Please disregard my question. It appears to be working now. Probably a ProtonVPN issue. :)
07:34:04 <malicoye[m]> Why suddenly blue icons instead of Android green? Did I miss something big?
07:34:49 <hazel[m]> circumstances, apparently
07:37:34 <FuchsiaOS_when> <malicoye[m] "Why suddenly blue icons instead "> The accent color was changed recently
07:38:11 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.05.03
07:38:24 <FuchsiaOS_when> And also, wow it's already at stable
07:38:36 <malicoye[m]> Is this Graphene related thing or AOSP?
07:38:42 <malicoye[m]> I mean colors
07:39:36 <FuchsiaOS_when> More likely an initial GrapheneOS theming change
07:42:19 <ayaen_t[m]> yeah mostly.
07:43:31 <dar_gomml[m]> is there a way i can help with voltesupport on my domestic carrier? or I can diagnose what s wrong?
07:48:14 <Jibbler30> So I followed the Installation guide a few times and I keep getting "Your device has loaded a different operating system."
07:48:15 <strcat[m]> dar_gomml: there will be a new Beta release in a week or two with more carrier-specific configuration beyond just having updated APNs
07:48:20 <strcat[m]> will need testing
07:48:24 <strcat[m]> Jibbler30: that's what you want
07:48:42 <strcat[m]> Jibbler30: that's how it will be on any device not specifically made to run GrapheneOS
07:48:58 <strcat[m]> means verified boot is enabled and it's using our verified boot key flashed as part of installation
07:48:59 <Jibbler30> a pixel 4a?
07:49:07 <strcat[m]> yes
07:49:20 <strcat[m]> only a device made to run GrapheneOS as the stock OS would not have that screen
07:49:26 <Jibbler30> ah
07:49:48 <strcat[m]> it means it's using the key flashed onto the secure element rather than the hard-wired stock OS key
07:50:35 <Jibbler30> i must've completely missed the part where that notice was just Normal then but looking at videos now, yeah it totally is
07:50:39 <lovestory[m]> That's what I see
07:50:45 <lovestory[m]> When I boot up grapheneos
07:51:18 <lovestory[m]> And I'm passing the attestation audit
07:52:26 <Jibbler30> is there any ramifications for it? if I were to switch to a diff OS like calyx and try to do idk banking or smth
07:54:59 <lovestory[m]> What will I need to flash to correct the error, "Your device has loaded a different operating system"
07:55:31 <Jibbler30> apparently nothing
07:55:41 <Jibbler30> that's normal behavior
07:55:50 <Jibbler30> unless you've flashed back to stock
07:56:09 <ayaen_t[m]> theOne: its what is supposed to show up
07:56:42 <ayaen_t[m]> > it means it's using the key flashed onto the secure element rather than the hard-wired stock OS key
07:57:51 <lovestory[m]> Ok
07:59:20 <ayaen_t[m]> first time i saw that , didnt feel right either
08:03:51 <Jibbler30> i feel like they should put it in bold in the installation guide because I gotta imagine this question is just constantly coming up
08:04:11 <Jibbler30> considering i asked the same thing not two minutes before lol
08:06:48 <strcat[m]> we're working on a new installation guide that doesn't require using the CLI or any other software beyond your browser
08:07:09 <strcat[m]> for people who are not going to verify the signature with an OS-provided signify anyway
08:07:19 <strcat[m]> no security disadvantage to just doing the install via the browser
08:07:28 <strcat[m]> using WebUSB
08:07:40 <Jibbler30> ah neat
08:07:51 <strcat[m]> (and this could be run from local files opened in your browser too)
08:07:59 <strcat[m]> early in development atm
08:08:01 <strcat[m]> contributions welcome
08:08:07 <Jibbler30> for the record, i did find it very helpful
08:08:13 <strcat[m]> it has support for locking, fetching device name from the device and unlocking atm
08:08:35 <strcat[m]> needs to have code written to download the zip and use Chromium's filesystem api or something to store it
08:08:51 <strcat[m]> extract files with a zip implementation, and then flash them with the same fastboot protocol it's using for the rest
08:11:01 <banjo[m]> I was planning to get a new black cable, but after reading the above posts I guess I'll just paint the original one.
08:11:02 <banjo[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ITGM1XILb4&t=133
08:14:37 <strcat[m]> just don't make the mistake of buying anything from https://www.moddiy.com/
08:16:00 <strcat[m]> fake 5 star reviews on everything, fake claims about which companies/organizations use it (reminds me of Copperhead) and one time I actually bought a part I couldn't find anywhere else from them and I'm pretty sure they leaked by credit card info - had to have that card replaced
08:16:37 <strcat[m]> only time I've ever had that issue, 99% sure it was them
08:24:21 <anonhat[m]> Gotta get that Privacy.com subscription
08:36:55 <cyberneticanime> Donate to graphene os! =-)
09:22:29 <joni> Hi everyone, I've just updated my pixel 3a and I've noticed my default wallpaper is gone. I've seen in the changelogs that it's normal but I would like to get the former one back. What's his name and how can I find it ?
09:28:37 <FuchsiaOS_when> Try looking at commit on github.com/grapheneos that changes it, then look for the upstream equivalent at android.googlesource.com
09:33:43 <joni> Hi FuschiaOS, I can't find it on github between all repositories
09:33:57 <joni> I've already give it a try
09:38:09 <fakhx[m]> https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/best-google-pixel-4-deals/
10:08:25 <lodtank> hello, just a little question/hint: if i go there https://grapheneos.org/releases#release-announcements the twitter link just goes to twitter.com, not the grapheneos account. is this supposed to be that way?
10:11:31 <ayaen_t[m]> lodtank: the one right at the bottom , you mean?
10:13:40 <FuchsiaOS_when> <joni "I've already give it a try"> https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_frameworks_base/blob/android-11.0.0_r28/core/res/res/drawable-nodpi/default_wallpaper.png
10:14:58 <FuchsiaOS_when> yeah,it was on github mirror apparently
10:15:14 <FuchsiaOS_when> Can't see it in android.googlesource.com
10:17:30 <FuchsiaOS_when> <lodtank "hello, just a little question/hi"> Not really
10:17:54 <FuchsiaOS_when> Or rather, it is not supposed to be the case
10:27:35 <lodtank> FuchsiaOS_when: i mean the link in the text "Releases are announced on this page including via an atom feed, via our @GrapheneOS Twitter account"
10:27:50 <lodtank> on "@GrapheneOS Twitter account"
10:28:38 <ayaen_t[m]> lodtank: good catch
10:28:42 <ayaen_t[m]> i too have same issue
10:28:52 <ayaen_t[m]> thanks
10:32:56 <FuchsiaOS_when> <ayaen_t[m] "i too have same issue"> Yeah, it's just twitter.com
10:33:35 <ayaen_t[m]> well we'll have to report this
10:38:29 <nscnt> The link goes to the GrapheneOS twitter account for me
10:39:03 <nscnt> ah
10:39:05 <nscnt> already fixed
10:39:08 <nscnt> that's why
10:42:13 <ayaen_t[m]> yep . it got fixed
10:42:27 <ayaen_t[m]> lodtank: it shoulde be ok now.
10:42:43 <ayaen_t[m]> thanks again for pointing that out.
10:45:58 <timeistruevalue[> I flashed my pixel 4a (5g) and bricked it lol. Forgot it was 5g version 😬. Make sure u don't forget like I did 🙏
10:46:29 <ayaen_t[m]> you mean soft bricked right?
10:48:03 <timeistruevalue[> No matter what I do, the screen won't give a output
10:49:10 <ayaen_t[m]> you should probably ask around . have you tried putting it in fastbootmode ? or trie dbringing up the bootloader?

10:59:50 <ayaen_t[m]> a handsome paperweight.
11:06:30 <lodtank> ayaen_t[m]: you're welcome, works now fine here
11:07:30 <lodtank> i think i read the camera app is not really supposed to be used? so i should switch to another one? any suggestions?
11:09:02 <strcat[m]> using the Camera app is fine
11:09:05 <strcat[m]> it's just very barebones
11:09:08 <strcat[m]> if that's fine for you, use it
11:10:03 <christian-h> Regarding the stock camera, it appears to smooth faces is there a way to disable that?
11:12:58 <strcat> I don't think it does that, at least not itself
11:20:57 <nscnt> oof
11:40:16 <user73629[m]> Good job sneakily changing the system color scheme in the latest update heh
11:40:50 <user73629[m]> It is less hard on the eyes doe
11:50:42 <strcat[m]> it's in the release notes
11:51:03 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.05.03
11:51:07 <strcat[m]> default theme: use blue accent color
11:51:13 <strcat[m]> can tweak other colors like the settings ones later
12:06:10 <Yurimazu> Hi! I just finished the Graphene installation on a device and after the shell gave me a message of "Rebooting into bootlader - OKAY - Finished." only "<waiting for any device>" showed up. Have not been able to boot the Pixel any more, neither in fastboot nor regular boot. Any help on this - or have I just created a 500$ brick?
12:06:47 <Yurimazu> Would be really grateful for any advice / hint about that.
12:08:34 <strcat> Yurimazu: by finished which part are you talking about?
12:08:38 <strcat> the locking step is the final step
12:09:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: wew
12:10:12 <Yurimazu> strcat could not do that. It went all black after the shell threw me the "Rebooting into bootloader".
12:10:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's like objectively the best color combination
12:10:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Yurimazu "Hi! I just finished the Graphene"> What device
12:11:31 <Yurimazu> Pixel 4a 5G :-(  And yes, that is based on "a friend recommended".
12:12:00 <strcat[m]> we don't support the Pixel 4a 5G
12:12:25 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
12:12:32 <strcat[m]> we only support the original Pixel 4a
12:13:08 <Yurimazu> Yes, I am aware of that after I checked the site. That is why I asked here if anyone has any idea on how to fix that.
12:13:23 <strcat[m]> sounds like you flashed our sunfish (4a) release on the 4a 5G (bramble)
12:13:42 <Yurimazu> Yes, that seems to be the case.
12:13:47 <strcat[m]> Yurimazu: don't know, I'd suggest trying to get their to replace it
12:13:55 <strcat[m]>  * Yurimazu: don't know, I'd suggest trying to get them to replace it
12:15:25 <Yurimazu> Thanks... not great news, but I really appreciate a well-founded advice on that. Thank you.
12:18:40 <strcat[m]> we could start adding sanity checks for device type
12:18:48 <strcat[m]> but they don't have them in the AOSP / stock images beyond what's already done
12:21:29 <Yurimazu> Yes, I thought I checked about the device before I started, to be better safe than sorry. But not thorough enough.
12:40:15 <Yurimazu> Well, have a great non-sleeping phase y'all, bye, bye.
12:50:39 <COVID-1984> How is it that YouTube adverts in Vanadium are able to keep playing when Vanadium is put in the background, but the actual YouTube videos aren't? Happens often because I reflexively stop the ads from playing (I don't have the GOS recommended adblocking setup yet).
12:55:10 <strcat> it supports playing videos in the background
12:55:14 <strcat> youtube doesn't
12:55:39 <FuchsiaOS_when> Unsure, but Youtube and Chromium are designed by Google
12:55:50 <strcat> it's youtube that doesn't support background video playback
12:56:03 <strcat> it's part of the premium subscription
12:56:28 <strcat> chromium supports it just fine
12:56:34 <strcat> you have to use the proper API for it
12:57:30 <FuchsiaOS_when> <COVID-1984 "How is it that YouTube adverts i"> Oh I assumed this is on Vanadium (youtube on Vanadium, as Youtube app itself depends on Play services?)
12:58:09 <strcat> youtube just chooses not to support background video playback on mobile
12:58:13 <strcat> either in the browser or the app
12:58:18 <strcat> unless you pay for the premium version
12:58:22 <strcat> the subscription
12:58:39 <strcat> it's not an issue with the browser at all
12:59:08 <strcat> unfortunately the Pixel 2 extended support release is not working
12:59:12 <strcat> so that's cancelled for now
12:59:21 <strcat> unless a Pixel 2 maintainer steps up we probably won't do another release
12:59:49 <strcat> could try to see if it's something obvious
13:00:38 <theOne[m]> Does the calendar have no option for me to add events or reminders?
13:01:06 <strcat> theOne[m]: it's a sample app for testing
13:01:15 <strcat> it's not meant to be used
13:01:27 <strcat> we have an issue open about hiding the launcher icon
13:01:38 <strcat> it needs to be tested that it still passes tests if we do that
13:01:52 <strcat> theOne[m]: use Etar or another calendar app
13:02:41 <theOne[m]> Sweet, I'm still trying to import my contacts from google contacts
13:03:43 <besamim5781[m]> <theOne[m] "Does the calendar have no option"> In fact the sample calendar app syncs with existing account but you can't make your own entries
13:03:57 <besamim5781[m]> * In fact the sample calendar app syncs with existing accounts but you can't make your own entries
13:04:20 <strcat> theOne[m]: export them and then import that
13:04:56 <theOne[m]> I've tried exporting then importing however the transition didn't go so well
13:05:32 <banjo[m]> @freenode_Yurimazu:matrix.org:  4a 5g is not supported :(
13:06:30 <banjo[m]> do you have warranty?
13:23:04 <COVID-1984> ah so no wonder ads on YT can continue playing then... can't wait to get adblocking setup as described on GOS FAQ :)
13:51:41 <tealopintoscom[m> Does the 'always use dark firmware theme' in the new update mean I can't force it back to white theme?
13:52:41 <FuchsiaOS_when> <tealopintoscom[m "Does the 'always use dark firmwa"> More of the "Google" part when you reboot. Test it, reboot while not being in dark mode
13:58:51 <strcat> tealopintoscom[m: it doesn't impact dark mode in the OS
13:59:38 <strcat> since we're going to have a boot animation with a black background, the screen leading to it should be black
13:59:48 <strcat> regardless of what's used in the OS
14:24:03 <hiroshi[m]> hello folks. is any option in grapheneOs to disable the front camara ?
14:24:31 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hiroshi[m] "hello folks. is any option in gr"> Tape it
14:25:02 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hiroshi[m] "hello folks. is any option in gr"> Or have a slider kind of sticker on it
14:25:18 <strcat[m]> hiroshi: in terms of the OS you can disable apps from accessing it
14:25:18 <hiroshi[m]> haha that is an epic hack but the display in a google pixel 4a is a problem for the tape
14:25:34 <strcat[m]> and the ones you allow to access it can only do that in the foreground
14:25:43 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hiroshi[m] "haha that is an epic hack but th"> Yeah, was about to say that doesn't apply to 4a
14:25:58 <strcat[m]> so if the question is about the OS go into the permission manager
14:26:06 <strcat[m]> make sure only the Camera app has it (already the case, probably)
14:26:45 <hiroshi[m]> strcat: I'm checking that right now
14:26:47 <hiroshi[m]> thanks
14:27:03 <strcat[m]> yeah new Pixel 2 builds are not booting
14:27:16 <strcat[m]> so need someone in the community that cares about Pixel 2 extended releases to step up and help
14:27:23 <hazel[m]> you can prolly make a circular cutout from electrical tape
14:27:35 <hazel[m]> (don't actually do this please)
14:27:54 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hazel[m] "you can prolly make a circular c"> That'll not stick that long
14:28:09 <hazel[m]> twas a joke
14:28:23 <nscnt> Actually
14:28:53 <nscnt> I got it working with a sticker that you put between pages of sheets on a Pixel 3a
14:29:13 <nscnt> And it didn't came of
14:29:20 <nscnt> *come
14:29:29 <FuchsiaOS_when> <nscnt "I got it working with a sticker "> Just generic sticker?
14:29:54 <strcat[m]> [   90.324960] c5      1 init: starting service 'vendor.thermal-hal-2-0'...
14:29:57 <strcat[m]> that looks like the cause
14:30:28 <nscnt> Yes, the ones you but between pages. I cut something out of the part that has glue on it and it works :D
14:44:45 <hasnoname[m]> 4xl doesn't show Ota update
14:45:22 <strcat> it's available
14:45:32 <FuchsiaOS_when> <hasnoname[m] "4xl doesn't show Ota update"> What version are you on?
14:45:33 <strcat> check what version you're on
14:45:35 <faxing[m]> new update is awesome
14:45:49 <FuchsiaOS_when> Check your build number, might have been updated in a reboot
14:45:58 <faxing[m]> (mostly the colour scheme lol)
14:46:49 <strcat> think I probably figured out the issue for the Pixel 2 extended support release
14:46:50 <strcat> hopefully works
14:46:52 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat "check what version you're on"> I'm on latest. Thanks. But I did not even know an update had happened
14:47:20 <FuchsiaOS_when> <faxing[m] "(mostly the colour scheme lol)"> (True haha)
14:47:32 <FuchsiaOS_when> Early security patches are awesome too
14:47:45 <FuchsiaOS_when> Speedy shift to stable channel too
14:48:32 <FuchsiaOS_when> <FuchsiaOS_when "Early security patches are aweso"> Quite nice changes and updates (on some apps)
14:49:49 <FuchsiaOS_when> <FuchsiaOS_when "Quite nice changes and updates ("> (Seedvault especially)
14:50:42 <strcat> hasnoname[m]: did you disable notifications from Updater?
14:50:46 <strcat> you must have rebooted to be on it
14:50:57 <strcat> maybe you just didn't realize
14:52:14 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat "hasnoname: did you disable notif"> I didnt modify anything related to updater
14:53:06 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat "maybe you just didn't realize"> Probably. I usually reboot my phone just before I sleep and leave it on a counter. Must have happened then.
14:55:15 <strcat[m]> hasnoname: it auto downloads / installs when Updater is enabled
14:55:23 <faxing[m]> <hasnoname[m] "Probably. I usually reboot my ph"> Check your version number
14:55:33 <strcat[m]> so yeah you probably just rebooted
14:55:34 <faxing[m]> Open settings, scroll down, click about, scroll down again (i think)
14:55:40 <strcat[m]> and it boots into the new version
14:55:53 <strcat[m]> and then if it succeeds at booting it activates that as the new active OS version
14:55:59 <strcat[m]> if it fails to boot a few times, it rolls back
14:56:06 <faxing[m]> RQ1A.210105.002.2021.01.05.03  ->  new version
14:56:38 <strcat[m]> if you enable the idle reboot option in Updater it will actually reboot after an update too
14:56:44 <strcat[m]> so it can keep itself updated indefinitely
14:56:48 <strcat[m]> but it's not very convenient
14:56:57 <strcat[m]> since then your phone won't be logged in and you won't have noticed
14:57:28 <strcat[m]> we probably need to add a notification after the idle reboot to make it very noticeable
14:57:40 <strcat[m]> anyway it's a fairly niche option
15:06:00 <blkqi[m]> how does one access the updater app?
15:07:19 <strcat[m]> blkqi: iSettings -> System -> System update settings
15:07:22 <strcat[m]>  * blkqi: Settings -> System -> System update settings
15:07:30 <strcat[m]> it's a standard location for it in AOSP
15:07:39 <strcat[m]> the Updater app just implements what makes it show up there
15:07:49 <FuchsiaOS_when> For owner users
15:08:10 <blkqi[m]> understood thanks. My device updated seamlessly anyway, but wasn't sure where the controls were
15:08:29 <strcat[m]> atm the way to disable it is simply disable Updater as a whole
15:08:42 <strcat[m]> we haven't implemented more granular toggles for that
15:08:57 <strcat[m]> changes to Updater need to be done very carefully
15:09:03 <strcat[m]> and it's important to preserve the way it works as the default
15:09:24 <hazel[m]> was alarmed at how easy updating was tbh. used to it being complex in my former experience with custom ROMs
15:10:32 <hazel[m]> then again my last experience with postmarket firmware was when Android version decimal points meant something
15:11:09 <strcat[m]> now there are just quarterly releases
15:11:16 <strcat[m]> usually they don't really increase the user-facing version for them
15:11:21 <strcat[m]> and the yearly major updates
15:11:36 <strcat[m]> I don't know why they don't do .1, .2, .3, etc. for quarterly
15:11:43 <strcat[m]> probably because the changes are usually tiny
15:11:55 <strcat[m]>  * probably because the user-facing changes are usually tiny
15:12:09 <strcat[m]> it's mostly about backporting under the hood improvements
15:35:57 <tealopintoscom[m> Is it normal that the "finishing system update" notification is still on for a few hours after the restart?
15:37:09 <faxing[m]> Not a few hours
15:37:19 <faxing[m]> Mine was there for like 30 seconds
15:41:30 <tealopintoscom[m> So what should I do?
15:44:20 <strcat[m]> tealopintoscom: which device
15:48:05 <wisconsinova> Has anyone get the installation done on the S9+?
15:49:29 <tealopintoscom[m> <strcat[m] "tealopintoscom: which device"> Pixel 4a
15:50:08 <FuchsiaOS_when> <wisconsinova "Has anyone get the installation "> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
15:50:22 <FuchsiaOS_when> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
15:52:13 <FuchsiaOS_when> <wisconsinova "Has anyone get the installation "> Not really worth the effort as the baseline security will not be maintained at all
15:55:18 <strcat[m]> tealopintoscom: I'd suggest just rebooting so it does it again
15:55:24 <strcat[m]> it does it in a transactional way
15:55:28 <strcat[m]> unsure why it wouldn't have finished
16:00:58 <Mother> I have app that crashes on Android11 and also on Graphene, is there way to locate Android10 version of graphene.zip for pixel4xl?
16:05:54 <FuchsiaOS_when> <Mother "I have app that crashes on Andro"> Have you tried getting a logcat of the crash?
16:07:00 <Mother> I have not, I just installed legit Android 10 to see if that fixed the crashes and it did, that is as far as I have gotten.
16:07:30 <Mother> Since app crashed on Graphene and Android 11, I assumed that it was an incompatibility issue.
16:10:23 <FuchsiaOS_when> Did you deny any permissions as you open the app (Sensors denied is normally acceptable, Network denied can crash some apps)?
16:11:37 <Mother> I enabled everything I could find, even file system access.
16:12:16 <FuchsiaOS_when> <Mother "I enabled everything I could fin"> Maybe it's something caught in the hardened malloc and libc
16:12:17 <Mother> I also enabled everything on Android10

16:23:08 <FuchsiaOS_when> <Mother "So... from the machine I used to"> Yeah
16:23:19 <Mother> OK, thank you.
16:32:33 <nscnt> It doesn't look like an GrapheneOS issue. As you've stated, your app didn't work on stock Android 11 as well. Contact the app developer
16:38:04 <telum[m]> <CanadaisCold1 "Just to confirm, T-MObile VOLTE "> On this, I think we should make an unofficial support doc somewhere with anecdotal info on which providers work with GOS, and where. It would be good to see international info too.
16:38:35 <strcat> telum[m]: once we add the expanded carrier configuration from the stock OS, it will mostly only be an issue with some US carriers
16:38:58 <strcat> and eSIM since the usual implementation depends on Google services for activation and we need a new eSIM activation app
16:39:07 <strcat> we have eSIM support in the OS which works properly
16:39:09 <strcat> but not an activation app
16:39:20 <telum[m]> An additional benefit would be learning which carriers' prepaid options have semi anonymous payment options. (I.e. can pay cash, doesn't require real name, etc)
16:39:58 <telum[m]> That way we can direct people there, and have more info than we could remember alone.
16:41:53 <Mother> nscnt my hope was to install GrapheneOS10 if I can get version of it.
16:50:58 <al1> Hello
16:51:44 <take_a_deep_brea> al1: hello
16:51:44 <take_a_deep_brea> Mother grapheneOS only supports aosp android 11
16:52:02 <take_a_deep_brea> Mother: could you share the name of this app
16:52:19 <Mother> OK, that's what I was kinda thinking since I could not find previous version.
16:52:29 <Mother> ATAK is the app.
16:52:56 <take_a_deep_brea> ok
16:54:04 <take_a_deep_brea> Mother : is it ATAK-civ that i find in playstore
16:54:16 <Mother> It is...
16:54:29 <Mother> You can also download via civtak.org
16:54:45 <Mother> So no need to get from playstore.
16:57:30 <take_a_deep_brea> ok
16:57:59 <wisconsinova> fuchsiaos_when: Why?
16:59:43 <wisconsinova> FuchsiaOS_when: why would the baseline security fall down in a S9+ device?
17:02:49 <strcat> wisconsinova: it won't support the hardware-based security features with an alternate OS
17:03:16 <strcat> and also that's not the current gen, we wouldn't ever add a past gen device as a newly supported one
17:06:59 <take_a_deep_brea> Mother: for some reason it wont allow me to view the website . are you involved asa healthworker orsomething ?
17:07:45 <Mother> Negative, I am just a regular dude.
17:08:02 <take_a_deep_brea> okcool app tho
17:08:28 <Mother> If you are outside of the US you may not have access.
17:09:51 <take_a_deep_brea> Mother: on playstore it shows its compatible with my 4a
17:16:38 <Mother> It just requires Android 5 or newer.
17:17:05 <Mother> I think it should be compatible, but tanked on my 4xl
17:17:39 <PirateOfthe7Seas> Hello
17:17:43 <PirateOfthe7Seas> New Update is good.exe
17:17:57 <wisconsinova> Okay: no surprises.
17:18:12 <take_a_deep_brea> PirateOfthe7Seas:  welcome
17:18:23 <take_a_deep_brea> to the room
17:19:08 <take_a_deep_brea> Mother: yep . if i could have gotten hold of the apk i would have done some tinkering sorry
17:19:24 <Mother> No worries.
17:19:43 <Mother> I'll tinker with it some more today.
17:25:08 <justanotherlurke> Please advise on: How to backup / restore a secondary user profile?
17:25:08 <justanotherlurke> The recommendation I read here several times was to use adb backup, but I fail to get adb access to my secondary profile. There is no developer option when I am logged in into that user, and enabling it in the owner profile, logging into the secondary profile on the phone and trying adb only brings me to the owner's files.
17:25:08 <justanotherlurke> What am I doing wrong? 🤔
17:29:34 <take_a_deep_brea> try enabling in owner and then switch to secondary profile
17:30:19 <take_a_deep_brea> aorry
17:35:05 <dazinism> justanotherlurker: I've bot tried adb backup of a different profile.
17:35:40 <dazinism> But if you connect adb to the device you can pull and push to the storage of any profile
17:35:57 <dazinism> Theres some info about backups here
17:36:12 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups#adb_backup
17:38:10 <dazinism> Theres a link to some info about using seedvault to backup secondary users, not tired that.
17:43:41 * dazinism sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xkjLpRZMBbibMYpTdRbEJqbY/message.txt >
17:44:09 <dazinism> You can find out the user number of any profiles you have using
17:44:17 <dazinism> `adb shell pm list users`
17:44:53 <dazinism> --user 0 is the main user profile
17:45:15 <dazinism> Normally the next ones are 11, 12 etc.
17:47:27 <faxing[m]> Is it worth it to enable WiFi talk and text?
17:48:05 <faxing[m]> It improves privacy by not connecting to LTE but would worsen privacy as you need to put in your address, city, state, zip, etc. for the "Emergency 911 information"
17:59:37 <PirateOfthe7Seas> Yeah Id rather use LTE with cell tower triangulation than wifi
18:00:16 <PirateOfthe7Seas> LTE-Only mode, I reccomend you use *yoda voice*
18:01:00 <faxing[m]> alright, thank you so much for the information haha
18:10:14 <Yzordderrex[m]> How come the default dialer app does not have a dark theme? Same goes for the Contacts app.
18:12:12 <justanotherlurke> <dazinism "justanotherlurker: I've bot trie"> Thanks for the information, then I probably just did something in the wrong way. Will read up on the Wiki and try again.
18:13:39 <justanotherlurke> <dazinism "Normally the next ones are 11, 1"> From seeing my files in /storage/emulated/10/... I guess my secondary user is 10?
18:19:13 <nscnt> Yzordderrex[m]: These apps are unmaintained
18:22:42 <ihateblue> me want back green how go blue away
19:09:29 <idiot6> how do I revert to stock?

20:17:05 <nscnt> lul
20:17:12 <TheJollyRoger> Pick one name and settle on it, please.

20:19:30 <QubesWhonix1> I dont see you 'disciplining' other users
20:19:35 <QubesWhonix1> Can you just, leave me alone
20:19:36 <nscnt> Here guys is an example what mixing identities means. While you change your username, you're still sticking out by the same spamming
20:20:18 <take_a_deep_brea> yep.
20:20:20 <TheJollyRoger> QubesWhonix1: I don't pursue other users, because generally, they respect my requests or depart the channel.
20:20:38 * TheJollyRoger glances at his watch and starts the timer.
20:20:57 <take_a_deep_brea> please stop dawning things so loudly if yoi want to be anonymous
20:21:14 <TheJollyRoger> take_a_deep_brea: sssh... you'll tip him off, hehehe.
20:21:29 <TheJollyRoger> take_a_deep_brea: looks like Matrix is finally talking to Freenode, I can see your messages now.
20:21:46 <take_a_deep_brea> great
20:25:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, from time to time this weird thing happens where for some unlucky users on the Matrix side of things, IRC doesn't realize they've joined or it goes out of sync, so some people end up seeing them, and some people don't. I have no idea why this happens or how to work around it, only that sometimes if we wait it out it eventually resolves.
20:26:46 <take_a_deep_brea> TheJollyRoger: well never used irc before . so would it make life easier overall to use irc ?
20:28:43 <TheJollyRoger> take_a_deep_brea: I think for now if you're comfortable where you are, then stick with it. I prefer IRC since I have some compatibility issues, but there are some downsides to IRC, namely being that Matrix does have to implement some workarounds for IRC's lack of modern messaging features such as attachments and inline images, and these often aren't very convenient on IRC.
20:30:15 <nscnt> And IRC isn't nice for asynchronous messaging out of the box
20:30:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
20:31:08 <take_a_deep_brea> being on both atleast gives a complete picture
20:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I used to be on both, although at this moment I've had a few problems so I'm down to one >_<
20:32:25 <justanotherlurke> Which file systems does GrapheneOS support on external USB stick? (E.g. for OTG-data transfer.)
20:32:25 <justanotherlurke> And is there any recommended encryption for such external USB devices that works well with GrapheneOS?
20:32:53 <thematrix5000[m]> is there a way to show more than 4 apps running on the top status bar
20:33:29 <TheJollyRoger> Hi justanotherlurke, if I recall correctly when you format a USB drive from GrapheneOS it's going to be File Allocation Tables. I have a spare drive here, want me to check?
20:33:44 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: when plugged into your desktop though, it's going to be Media Transfer Protocol.
20:35:29 <nscnt> thematrix5000[m]: Not sure what you mean
20:37:27 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: just going to check now.
20:38:32 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "Hi justanotherlurker, if I recal"> Hi TheJollyRoger: and first of all thanks for all the informative replies I have read from you here over the last weeks.
20:38:32 <thematrix5000[m]> the top by the time on the left shows the apps running
20:38:56 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: hey, anytime, that's what I'm here for.
20:39:26 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: Looks like if you format a USB drive on GrapheneOS, it will come out as FAT32.
20:39:40 <justanotherlurke> TheJollyRoger: It's very much appreciated. And I learned a lot by just reading stuff here and on the website.
20:40:08 <TheJollyRoger> Heh heh, well, strcat writes virtually all of the website!
20:40:59 <TheJollyRoger> If you're interested in drive encryption (which is very pragmatic, since USB drives tend to have this uncanny ability to vanish off of desks, out of backpacks, and out of pockets, and sometimes they don't always return to the bottom of the washing machine), I know some members here, myself included, have found good luck with EDS Lite.
20:41:15 <justanotherlurke> And he does that in a way that makes reading it interesting. If a little challenging to a non-dev, though, due to the whole lot of information condensed into a few sentences.
20:41:42 <TheJollyRoger> EDS Lite can open up, read from, and write to Veracrypt-encrypted and LUKS-encrypted drives and drive volumes.
20:42:07 <take_a_deep_brea> <justanotherlurke "And he does that in a way that m"> thats true. sad thing being people think him unfriendly.
20:42:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah :(
20:42:21 <justanotherlurke> TheJollyRoger: EDS Lite is for the phone or the PC?
20:42:31 <take_a_deep_brea> <TheJollyRoger "EDS Lite can open up, read from,"> good to know.
20:42:52 <take_a_deep_brea> well justanotherlurker ,TheJollyRoger  im off for the night!
20:43:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, EDS Lite is for the phone. Veracrypt will be for your desktop; it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, although if you have Linux, chances are you will have Cryptsetup, which can also read and write to Veracrypt encrypted drives and volumes.
20:43:08 <TheJollyRoger> take_a_deep_brea: yarr, sleep well shipmate!
20:44:02 <TheJollyRoger> However, some people, myself included, find Cryptsetup somewhat difficult to use because it's a commandline app. There are graphical frontends to it like ZuluCrypt, which offer Graphical functionality overtop Cryptsetup, although I haven't used ZuluCrypt before so I can't vouch for it.
20:44:04 <take_a_deep_brea> aye!
20:44:16 <justanotherlurke> <take_a_deep_brea "thats true. sad thing being peop"> My impression is "right to the point and no bullshit" - which some people always misinterpret as unfriendly, because they do not like the "naked truth". Not to mention being told they are wrong and should do the research. 😉
20:44:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee, yeah.
20:45:13 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "However, some people, myself inc"> I am fine with cryptsetup on the cl, been using LUKS encrypted volumes for a while. Will take a look at EDS.
20:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:45:26 <justanotherlurke> take_a_deep_breath: Good night and secure dreams. 😉
20:45:51 <TheJollyRoger> I think you've got just about everything you need then!
20:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> Just going to try one last thing... I got a USB drive that's formatted in ISO9660.
20:46:55 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, interesting. Looks like GrapheneOS can read to it although I can't test writing to it at this moment.
20:47:10 <TheJollyRoger> *read from it, although I can't test writing to it at this moment since I need this drive.
20:48:07 * justanotherlurke sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/WdiQuupkSKSvUPPKYVjoUhOS/message.txt >
20:48:40 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Yeah, that should be it!
20:49:09 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "*read from it, although I can't "> Don't think writing would work oob, 9660 is intended as dvd on usb, iirc?
20:49:39 <TheJollyRoger> Once you create the drive you'll just need to make sure it's formatted as FAT32, but just one moment, I'm going to try a small experiment and see if I can get it to read ext4-formatted USB drives...
20:51:01 <TheJollyRoger> Since if I recall correctly, if you open up the .zip file containing the images, you end up with a bunch of sparse ext images.
20:51:30 <justanotherlurke> ext4 would be better for large files, say a mkv-movie I want to watch on the phone. Although that would probably be shrunk in file size for the screen size anyway ... not much experience with that.
20:51:30 <justanotherlurke> Which brings up another question: What is the format of the internal storage, is there a size limit for files, too?
20:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, shucks, looks like it doesn't if I just format the entire drive. Let me try seeing if I format it with MBR and then try.
20:52:08 <justanotherlurke> Will dig up an empty USB stick and experiment a little with it over the weekend.
20:52:21 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic, man!
20:52:49 <TheJollyRoger> Just reformatting the thing to MBR right now... going to try it in a partition.
20:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> Since it looks like if I format the drive on Graphene, it comes out with MBR.
20:53:25 <justanotherlurke> Compliments, btw, to all devs: First live update I did on my GOS went through without any glitches. (Same as the original install following the guide which some people seem not to read ... 🙄)
20:53:58 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "Since it looks like if I format "> Instead of GPT you mean?
20:54:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, instead of GPT.
20:54:16 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, darn, looks like I can get that one to work either. Shucks.
20:55:00 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like for the time being you'll have to use VFAT. I'm not sure what the internal storage is formatted as but I was under the impression it was ext. I will have to dig into it and get back to you on that though.
20:56:28 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, missed your earlier message, yes, ISO9660 is the CD/DVD ROM file format. So interestingly enough this does mean that GrapheneOS can read CDs. I think this may be because Android is used in some media players and likely that capability is still carried forward.
20:56:48 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: *yeah, 9660 is.
20:57:03 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "Looks like for the time being yo"> Don't worry, I can look up what AOSP does - don't think the fs will have been changed for GOS. And I have a solution for USB now, thanks to your help, too.
20:57:10 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:58:09 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "Whoops, missed your earlier mess"> Linux distributions can mount ISOs, so that might explain why GOS (and probably AOSP) has this capability, too.
20:59:16 <justanotherlurke> Anyway, gotta run now, thanks for your help so far. 👍️
21:08:02 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: you're welcome, take care!
21:26:09 <fakhx[m]> I am having issues with aurora store after last update : cant build google play api , anyone else have same ?

23:31:02 <strcat> Pixel 2 / 2 XL extended support release seems to be working now
23:31:22 <strcat> near the end of the road for those
23:31:48 <TheJollyRoger> Hey strcat, oh.
23:31:56 <TheJollyRoger> I... oh wow. I thought that the October release was the last one.
23:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you for the one last update... I guess this will be the "fond farewell" update for the 2/2XL?
23:38:22 <strcat> we already did a nov 1st sec update for them
23:38:24 <strcat> this is still nov 1st
23:38:51 <strcat> but there were a final set of updates in december as a special update later than the monthly update for other devices
23:38:59 <TheJollyRoger> Oh I see.
23:38:59 <strcat> covering some things like GPU firmware
23:39:11 <strcat> and we're shipping the OS changes we've had since then
23:39:15 <TheJollyRoger> Oh!
23:39:54 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: it's still at 2020-11-01 patch for good
23:40:05 <strcat> so there are diminishing returns to extended support releases
23:40:05 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see.
23:40:41 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, whew. I've been trying to encourage people to ditch their 2s and quickly upgrade to 4as as quickly as possible, since I don't know how long those handsets will hold.
23:41:54 <strcat> yeah they are EOL
23:41:59 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
23:42:02 <strcat> 2020-11-01 patch level forever isn't good
23:42:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
23:42:08 <strcat> no more firmware updates etc now
23:42:26 <strcat> they are mostly only missing January stuff
23:42:31 <strcat> after the Dec update
23:42:39 <strcat> but they are missing some nov 5th stuff
23:42:43 <strcat> so they can't go higher than 1st
23:43:19 <strcat[m]> builds done just waiting for a test release for testing update path
23:43:20 <TheJollyRoger> I wonder if there's a way to make those phones display something like "Your device is EOL. It will no longer be updated. Please replace it" when people log in. I'll try to see if I can write that up, that'd be a good first issue for me, maybe.
23:43:28 <TheJollyRoger> If... if you're OK with that?
23:43:43 <strcat[m]> could do that somehow
23:43:49 <strcat[m]> make a notification on boot
23:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
23:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> I'll... uh... I'll start digging but I could be a long time.
23:44:53 <TheJollyRoger> For now I'll just try to steer anyone who asks toward a 4a.
23:45:53 <strcat> also needed these updates to reduce update server load with that change
23:46:57 <narcoli[m]> just updated graphene can confirm everything is running well

23:47:34 <TheJollyRoger> I'm also on the 3 right now, it's running great for me too.
23:47:54 <narcoli[m]> very nice!
23:49:56 <TheJollyRoger> I'm... I'm going to miss my Pixel 3, when it's EOL.
