01:30:34 <Elementoshi[m]>  * Is there something similar to Moto Gestures for GrapheneOS? I like being able to turn on the flashlight on my phone with just a simple flick of the wrist
04:06:13 <vee81> hey guys, i tried installing graphene os on my pixel 4a but it doens't seem to go thorugh and now the phone is stuck in fastboot mode
04:06:15 <vee81> https://pastebin.com/4MaBdLdk
04:06:19 <vee81> that is the pastbin log
04:06:50 <vee81> can anyone help?
04:08:56 <take_a_deep_brea> have you been following the instructions here : https://grapheneos.org/installation
04:09:04 <vee81> yes sir
04:10:00 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry that was supposed to be *install not *installation . and i am no sir . just a regular person here. nice to meet you vee81:  .
04:10:18 <vee81> nice to meet you too!
04:10:38 <take_a_deep_brea> ok so , are you using  the usb-C to usb-C cord that came with the device ?
04:11:28 <vee81> im using a usb to usb c
04:11:44 <vee81> my laptop does not have a usb c port unfortunately
04:13:16 <take_a_deep_brea> okay . so the issue may be because of the cable  .  i have seen this happening with quiet some people even though the instructions were followed  .
04:13:40 <vee81> ah shoot.
04:14:19 <take_a_deep_brea> i did say may .
04:15:14 <take_a_deep_brea> where do you obtain fastboot from ? sorry i need to ask this as people sometimes follow instructions only partially
04:15:22 <vee81> the sdk site
04:16:36 <take_a_deep_brea> good. it is all good on your end.
04:16:54 <take_a_deep_brea> the usb connection may be to blame .
04:17:58 <vee81> let me try on a mac
04:18:02 <vee81> it has usb c on both ends
04:18:05 <take_a_deep_brea> you are on windows , using official SDK fastboot , and as far as i see the device does respond appropriately to the first few fastboot commands in the script
04:18:37 <take_a_deep_brea> vee81: please do so .
04:18:49 <take_a_deep_brea> i am sure that will work out just fine
04:23:54 <vee81> lets hope
04:24:00 <vee81> i just hope i didn't brick hte phone lol
04:27:10 <take_a_deep_brea> vee81: it is very difficult to brick a pixel. just make sure that the factory image you download is named **sunfish**
04:27:44 <vee81> it is
04:27:44 <take_a_deep_brea> it is a guaranteed method to brick  if you flash 4a image on 4a 5G or vice versa
04:28:03 <vee81> its still gave the same error about missing boot other img and odm.img
04:29:56 <take_a_deep_brea> great then at most you can soft-brick the device. that is if something goes wrong then you wont have an OS to boot and use like a normal user . but you can still access the device with fastboot and properly flash the stock OS if you desire to do so
04:31:33 <take_a_deep_brea> <vee81 "its still gave the same error ab"> those terminal output that go like "does not contain " are not relevant . you can ignore them
04:31:50 <take_a_deep_brea> vee81: watch out for fastboot error
04:32:53 <vee81> it looks like it worked!!!!!
04:32:55 <vee81> i guess the issue was the darn cable!
04:33:17 <take_a_deep_brea> weird
04:33:40 <take_a_deep_brea> they could have conirmed once with us .
04:33:47 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
04:34:09 <take_a_deep_brea> well they anyway seemed to know their way around .

04:45:44 <melodiousowls> First time installing GrapheneOS. Just got an unlocked Pixel 4a. Using OSX 10.15.7 I'm trying to unlock the bootloader. I already enable OEM unlocking in developer settings. When I try to restart the phone with vol down and power I don't have an option in the menu of unlocking the bootloader.
04:51:26 <melodiousowls> hello world?
04:52:00 <take_a_deep_brea> oh dear
04:52:59 <somenerd[m]> the install guide doesn't support older MacOS versions
04:53:05 <somenerd[m]> only Big Sur
04:53:22 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
04:53:34 <somenerd[m]> >Windows 10, macOS Big Sur, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS. You should make sure your operating system is up-to-date before proceeding with these instructions. Older versions and other Linux distributions usually work, but if you encounter problems try using one of the officially supported options.

06:29:31 <ephemeralang[m]> Hey, guys, what's your preferred method of "securing" + encrypting your DNS queries on Graphene OS?
06:32:14 <take_a_deep_brea> ephemeralang:  https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-dns and the sections following it describe the recommended setup
06:39:37 <take_a_deep_brea> ephemeralang:  graphene OS strives to have secure defaults while not breaking user experience . so if there is anything that needs to be set up securely  first take a look at the defaults then read whats said in https://grapheneos.org  and you will most of the time be served well . and then ofcourse we ask questions all the time ! i am just suggesting ways that could save you some time .
06:49:20 <ephemeralang[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "ephemeralang:  graphene OS striv"> Thanks, I appreciate it.
07:02:43 <ephemeralang[m]> Just to clarify that I understand correctly: even though the private DNS option has to initially look up the DNS provider hostname IP using your network's default dns, you should still be safe from MITM via DNS poisoning?
07:03:07 <ephemeralang[m]> Because of cert chains?
07:08:09 <strcat[m]> if you set a specific private DNS hostname, it authenticates the server
07:08:29 <strcat[m]> if you use the default 'automatic' mode, that only provides opportunistic protection against passive monitoring
07:08:57 <strcat[m]> the reason it has you enter a hostname rather than an IP is so that it can authenticate the server
07:10:30 <strcat[m]> ephemeralang: as it explains there, DNS-over-HTTPS/DNS-over-TLS don't really over much privacy or security
07:10:43 <strcat[m]> if a connection uses authenticated encryption, it's secure without this
07:10:49 <strcat[m]> if it doesn't, it's insecure regardless
07:31:04 <jonmonty[m]> F droid or GMS or individal apk downloads from browser to get apps? Whats the safest/ most secure and whats the most private?
07:31:51 <take_a_deep_brea> jonmonty: what do you mean by GMS /
07:31:53 <take_a_deep_brea> *?
07:32:13 <somenerd[m]> I think they're asking where to souce apps from
07:32:22 <somenerd[m]> and GMS is google play?
07:32:24 <somenerd[m]> afaict
07:32:30 <take_a_deep_brea> probably
07:32:36 <strcat> you can use Aurora Store to download apps from the Play Store
07:32:50 <strcat> jonmonty[m]: there isn't really a best option
07:33:18 <somenerd[m]> also this is kinda offtopic, care to join #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
07:33:19 <somenerd[m]> ?
07:33:20 <strcat> I expect many people will use both F-Droid and Aurora Store
07:33:23 <take_a_deep_brea> atleast play store apps get regular updates
07:33:50 <take_a_deep_brea> in comparison to their fdroid counterpart
07:33:55 <somenerd[m]> > I expect many people will use both F-Droid and Aurora Store
07:33:56 <somenerd[m]> true
07:34:10 <somenerd[m]> and there is more centralised trust with F-droid
07:34:18 <somenerd[m]> unless you use a lot of repos
07:35:44 <jonmonty[m]> <somenerd[m] "and GMS is google play?"> Sorry yes GPS
07:36:55 <jonmonty[m]> <somenerd[m] "also this is kinda offtopic, car"> Sorry will ask in off topic more specifically
07:36:56 <take_a_deep_brea> jonmonty:  this site lists good security/privacy criteria for selecting apps https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
07:37:12 <somenerd[m]> yeah you may want to take a look at that article as well
07:39:15 <jonmonty[m]> <somenerd[m] "yeah you may want to take a look"> Thanks
08:05:33 <bitc0d> Is it there an unoficial release for pixel 5?
08:05:37 <bitc0d> I'ld like to try this OS
08:30:26 <bitc0d> Also ... I noticed that pixel 5 has the code name of pixel 4a on your build page
08:30:51 <bitc0d> Why? ... as the code name for pixel 5 it is not bramble but redfin
08:30:57 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that there are builds yet, let me check
08:31:26 <somenerd[m]> there aren't apparently
08:31:46 <bitc0d> https://grapheneos.org/build
08:32:02 <bitc0d> There arent ... but the names are not correct
08:32:07 <somenerd[m]> yeah that's to build it yourself
08:32:15 <somenerd[m]> not official/unofficial builds
08:33:08 <bitc0d> aosp_redfin (Pixel 4a 5G) - experimental and incomplete
08:33:09 <bitc0d> aosp_bramble (Pixel 5) - experimental and incomplete
08:33:18 <bitc0d> I'm refering to this as piel 5 is actually redfin
08:34:26 <bitc0d> Is it there an eta for pixel 5 release (as beta at least)?
08:34:40 <bitc0d> As I'd like to try it but I don't think I will be able to build it myself and try it
08:39:47 <bitc0d> So ... with thta in mind ... the repo from github with redfin name is for pixel 5 (as it should) or for pixel 4a 5G ?
08:42:38 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that there's a eta yet
09:06:57 <noob> can graphene os be easily uninstalled back to factory google android?
09:07:57 <strcat> yes same process as installing it with an extra erase command to get rid of the GrapheneOS verified boot key
09:08:08 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
09:08:17 <strcat> not strictly required to run that extra command
09:08:23 <strcat> but it's needed to get back to a totally stock state
09:09:06 <noob> do I need to download the original android from somewhere or is it stored on the device somewhere?
09:09:50 <noob> I guess I'm asking where do I get the factory images?
09:34:52 <bitc0d> How can I see old messages?
09:35:16 <bitc0d> As I was disconected by the browser and don't know if somebody asked something to my questions :-(
09:35:27 <bitc0d> asked=responsed *

14:15:12 <tree79> hello friends. could anyone here help me with troubleshooting an app not working on grapheneos?
14:16:49 <tree79> it’s a norwegian cash app. here’s the google play link for reference: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.dnb.vipps
14:17:48 <tree79> i’m unable to pass the registration stage. i’m requested to input a phone number, but regardless of what i input, an unknown error occurs
14:18:46 <tree79> i’m wondering whether it might not have internet access as it fails immediately
14:20:42 <Elementoshi[m]> Is there something similar to Moto Gestures for GrapheneOS? I like being able to turn on the flashlight on my phone with just a simple flick of the wrist
14:21:15 <snooopy> tree79: What is the "unknown error"?
14:22:14 <tree79> i’ll be happy to take it to the offtopic channel if anyone has the possibility to help
14:23:58 <tree79> snooopy: it simply says «Something went wrong.»
14:24:36 <tree79> in a previous version it seemed to suggest there was a network error
14:27:03 <tree79> i open the app, i click log in, and input any properly encoded number (example: 47 47 47 47 will work), but it immediately fails and no more progress can be made
14:42:38 <newhere> hello guys
14:42:49 <newhere> i bought a used pixel 4 and flashed graphene os
14:42:54 <newhere> so happy with it
14:43:07 <newhere> but i have  problem
14:43:13 <newhere> when someone calls me
14:43:25 <newhere> i can't answer from the 1st swipe
14:43:39 <newhere> i have to repeat it 4-5 times until it work
14:44:01 <newhere> any suggestions
15:01:45 <adam69> hello, I keep getting this error: FAILED (Write to device failed (No such file or directory))
15:01:56 <adam69> I cannot figure out how to fix this error :/
15:07:21 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> which os are u using?
15:08:11 <adam69> pixel 4xl, was running the generic os
15:08:23 <adam69> halfway through i started getting that error
15:08:26 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> nono, the pc
15:08:30 <adam69> mac os
15:08:40 <adam69> ive done this before without the error
15:08:51 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> same usb cable?
15:08:55 <adam69> yup
15:09:54 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> all the files are in the same directory?
15:11:58 <adam69> just re-added them to the same directory, now stuck on 'waiting for device'

15:12:06 <John83> Hello
15:12:53 <John83> just bought a pixel 5, any news on the pixel 5 release?
15:13:10 <mulbr[m]> newhere: you use at&t someone had an issue with calls thru them
15:13:44 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> adam69 can u try a different port?
15:14:30 <newhere> mulbr[m] not at&t  not even in us
15:14:40 <newhere> it seems that the phone stuck
15:15:06 <newhere> when someone calls it keeps rigning but swipping up doesn't open the line
15:15:17 <adam69> ArrayIndexOutOfB still the same error..
15:15:25 <newhere> after 3-4 seconds only and 5 swips
15:15:32 <newhere> only it answers
15:15:33 <mulbr[m]> John83: in testing phase now
15:15:33 <mulbr[m]> Refer to chat rules re devices support
15:16:23 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> macos is update?
15:16:42 <newhere> Shall i go to off topic
15:16:49 <mulbr[m]> newhere: no idea, good luck!
15:17:36 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> adam69 try a different cable if you can
15:18:14 <adam69> havent updated my mac os, but the graphene is updated to the latest version and latest platform tools
15:19:04 <mulbr[m]> newhere: if no ones knows now, prob try back later. (5-10 hrs) This room should be the one
15:19:53 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> try to change cable if you can, than try update os
15:20:46 <newhere> mulbr[m] thanks
15:34:42 <adam69> ArrayIndexOutOfB now the device is not even being detected
15:34:45 <adam69> at all
15:35:04 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> do you upgrade the os or cable?
15:35:09 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> switch
15:35:25 <adam69> im gonna try on an entirely different machine
15:36:09 <CMike> Trying to install Graphene on a Pixel 4a (fully updated to Android 11 and all updates). Am doing this on Windows 10 and "fastboot --version" returns "30.0.5-6877874" but when I issue the "fastboot flashing unlock" command it just sits at "< waiting for any device >" indefinitely.
15:36:25 <CMike> Any suggestions?
15:36:49 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> try to change port/cable
15:38:30 <CMike> I did... using the USB-C port on my Lenovo P50 and using a premium Apple cable (the one for connecting to the 87W power supply for a MacBook Pro)
15:39:05 <adam69> ArrayIndexOutOfB just realised my problem.. i was installing the wrong version of graphene.. ive got a pixel 4 xl, and was trying to install the 4a version
15:39:12 <CMike> I gather I'm supposed to confirm something on the Pixel but no prompt shows up.
15:39:39 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> @adams :shrug:
15:41:00 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> CMike laptop cant find the pixel, so cable or port problem
15:41:28 <CMike> Laptop sees the Pixel when I plug it in, asks me what I want Windows to do with it (I choose "nothing")
15:41:32 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> or trying to install wrong version
15:42:25 <CMike> is there a particular USB mode the phone should be in ?
15:45:08 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> do you have OEM unlock the pixel?
15:45:28 <CMike> That's what I bought from the Google Play Store
15:45:50 <CMike> "Pixel 4a (128GB, Just Black, Unlocked)         Pixel 4a (128GB, Just Black, Unlocked) "
15:46:34 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> Before installing grapheneos you have to OEM unlocking the phone
15:46:45 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking follow this
15:47:34 <CMike> Yes, I did that (enable developer mode, toggle on "OEM unlocking"
15:48:52 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> Can u try to change machine/cable/port?
15:51:47 <CMike> Same result.  USB Preferences have the options "File Transfer/Android Auto", "USB tethering", "MIDI", "PTP", and "No Data Transfer" with the last one, No Data Transfer selected by default.  My suspicion is that this is incorrect.
15:53:09 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> W10 is updated?
15:53:14 <CMike> Yes
15:54:50 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> Do you try the pixel cable too?
15:55:15 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> The one packaged with the device
15:55:37 <CMike> Yes
15:56:39 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> Do You have a USB-C to USB-A cable to do a last try? with different port/cable
15:57:21 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> idk why it doesnt detect (look if you are installing the right graphene version)
16:00:43 <CMike> I haven't even gotten to installing Graphene yet; trying to get "fastboot flashing unlock" to work.
16:04:32 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> do you install dome driver before?
16:04:54 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> *do you install some driver before
16:05:13 <CMike> On Windows? No.
16:06:04 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> if you do everything in the official guide is a cable problem
16:32:17 <mynacol[m]> CMike: Go to Windows Update and search for updates. Afterwards, there should be a small Optional Updates button
16:33:50 <mynacol[m]> Under there, you will find some ... android ... driver. Install that and try again the grapheneos install
16:34:25 <CMike> I overlooked a critical step... "First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons."
16:37:33 <mynacol[m]> Well, that step is quite important 😏
16:47:58 <moomootootoo[m]> I've been having this weird issue where sometimes sms and calls don't show on a second profile but when I toggle back over to the admin profile I can see the missed call or text. Ita probably something I'm doing that's causing it but I'm not sure what it is since I'm not switching around and using the owner profile for anything.
16:52:26 <fomijafi[m]> <moomootootoo[m] "I've been having this weird issu"> Do you have phone calls & SMS switched on in the secondary profile settings?
16:54:51 <moomootootoo[m]> Yeah
17:08:57 <mynacol[m]> I think this is a known problem
17:44:48 <CMike> Okay -- Success!!!

18:36:55 <tidria[m]> Hello all, relatively new GrapheneOS user. I just got a Pixel 4a (5G) and wanted to ask if it uses the same channel as Pixel 4a in spite of minor hardware differences?
18:37:33 <jonmonty[m]> The 4a 5g is closer the the pixel 5 than the pixel 4a
18:38:06 <snooopy> tidria[m]: Sadly, no. iirc is the hardware like jonmonty[m] wrote, more like the pixel 5 than pixel 4a. :/
18:38:07 <jonmonty[m]> Graphene isnt released officially for the 4a 5g or pixel 5 yet
18:39:07 <strcat[m]> tidria: it's not minor hardware differences
18:39:07 <tidria[m]> Ok so the channel to watch for (assuming it doesnt get a dedicated channel) is the 5 then?
18:39:12 <strcat[m]> no
18:39:25 <Essjay[m]> <tidria[m] "Hello all, relatively new Graphe"> It does not share with the 4a. Don't try it. 4a 5G is under development. Reach out to anupritaisno1  if you want to help test.
18:39:27 <strcat[m]> if it's supported there will be a 4a 5G release
18:39:33 <strcat[m]> don't use the release for another device or you'll brick it
18:39:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> no please don't reach out to me
18:39:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> i have enough testers for pixel 5
18:40:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> what i need is a volunteer for pixel 4a 5g
18:40:25 <Essjay[m]> That's what he has
18:40:27 <tidria[m]> Thats what I have
18:40:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> if all goes well i should have a pixel 5 kernel booting today
18:41:31 <tidria[m]> Thanks for clarification by the way guys, wasn't finding much info for the 4a 5G on other avenues. anupritaisno1 if you need 4a 5G testign let me know
18:41:46 <tidria[m]> I should have the phone in hand around this time tomorrow
18:42:51 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
18:42:51 <strcat[m]> the best place to look for information is the official site
18:42:53 <strcat[m]> it's covered there
18:43:05 <strcat[m]> > The Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 aren't currently supported. The Pixel 4a 5G is poorly named and isn't really a variant of the Pixel 4a. It shares more in common with the Pixel 5 and our existing Pixel 4a support isn't relevant to it.
18:44:04 <tidria[m]> Ahh ya just found this, kind of stumbled into ownership of this device so I hadn't checked for updates to that section
18:44:05 <tidria[m]> thanks
18:48:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> 4a 5g and the 5 are the same processor
18:48:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> there is nothing similar between the regular 4a and the 4a 5g
18:49:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> flashing a 4a image onto a 4a 5g will brick the device
18:49:57 <blacklight447[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "flashing a 4a image onto a 4a 5g"> are we talking soft bricking or hard bricking here?
18:50:45 <strcat[m]> hard brick
18:50:49 <strcat[m]> probably
18:51:11 <strcat[m]> the 4a 5G is new and the firmware doesn't stop you bricking it like this atm
18:51:26 <strcat[m]> there's a reason we encourage people to update before flashing
19:07:23 <o9l[m]> hiya, i just wanna ask y'all, in case i need to uninstall graphenos and put the stock os back on my phone, how would i do that?
19:08:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hi o9l[m], you'd do it the same way you got GrapheneOS on there in the first place except for two things:
19:08:49 <TheJollyRoger> The first one is that you'd be using an image downloaded from Google, not GrapheneOS.
19:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> The second one is that to run GrapheneOS, the GrapheneOS installation script will give your bootloader the GrapheneOS verified boot key. Once your bootloader is unlocked, you must tell the bootloader to erase the key with the command at the bottom of the installation page where it talks about reverting.
19:10:07 <TheJollyRoger> The other way (easy way) is to visit https://flash.android.com and there is a webapp there that will walk you thorugh it.
19:10:57 <TheJollyRoger> Google's verified boot keys are permanently fused (physically burned) into non-erasable E-Fuses on the phone, so your phone can't "forget" them, and the update will be verified onboard your phone itself.
19:11:40 <TheJollyRoger> *and the image, and all subsequent updates to it, will be verified onboard
19:12:52 <o9l[m]> i dont expect to do this, i just want to make sure its possible, thank you. i hope to be using graphene here in an hour or so
19:13:39 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Make sure to read the entire install guide, end to end, top to bottom, before you begin. There's a lot of subtle (but highly important) parts in there that tend to result in nasty snags if you miss them.
19:14:04 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship in advance!
19:15:31 <o9l[m]> ahh, the chat broke on firefox, had to install chrome
19:16:10 <o9l[m]> thank you! i absolutely will, don't want to mess anything up
19:16:43 <TheJollyRoger> When your phone boots GrapheneOS, it should display a yellow "Your phone is loading a different operating system." If you see that and GrapheneOS comes up, all is working and well, and you can verify the installation (post install) using the attestation server.
19:16:45 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
19:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that warning turns orange and you get this ominous error about "Software integrity is not guaranteed" do you have to worry - if you see that screen, it means the bootloader has been unlocked and you can now make changes to the bootloader and system partitions bypassing all security checks. This is an important step to installing GrapheneOS, but the phone must not be left in this
19:18:00 <TheJollyRoger> state if you plan to use it.
19:18:58 <o9l[m]> thank you, i'll make sure to look out for that
19:19:40 <TheJollyRoger> If you have any apps, pictures, your 2FA Password seeds, or photos or anything of the sort left on that phone, back them up right now - once the phone is reset or the bootloader lock state is changed it will turn over the encryption keys in the secure element and all data on the phone will be lost.
19:19:56 <TheJollyRoger> *all data on the phone's SSD will be lost.
19:20:20 <o9l[m]> this is my first android phone and it just arrived, still getting used to the button placements haha
19:20:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha well then welcome to Android!
19:20:47 <o9l[m]> <TheJollyRoger "*all data on the phone's SSD wil"> no problem, nothing's on it
19:20:52 <TheJollyRoger> Whew!
19:25:34 <Toves> Hello everyone. I'm making a second attempt to install GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a, using a different Windows computer and after doing a factory reset of my phone. I'd like to ask for help in finding authentic up-to-date drivers for Windows 10. Last time I installed old unofficial drivers off the Internet, and was told that this was a big mistake. I don't know where to get proper drivers
19:25:34 <Toves> from, though.
19:26:28 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> from microsoft site?
19:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Toves, welcome back.
19:27:02 <Toves> I'll take a look at the Microsoft site.
19:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> I'm actually unsure myself. It looks like there's a way to obtain them and install them direct from the Android SDK manager.
19:27:25 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> no wait, it depend which driver?
19:28:03 <Toves> By the way, this time I'm following the official instructions to the letter. Ended up with the same problem though, probably due to the lack of drivers.
19:28:16 <TheJollyRoger> Toves: but you'd better wait for someone to confirm that, since I'm pretty useless on Windows beyond installing a video game.
19:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> for someone more knowledgeable than I, at the very least.
19:32:45 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> Toves https://www.qasimtricks.com/2020/04/fixed-fastboot-not-detecting-your-android-device.html
19:33:25 <Toves> Great!
19:34:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hold it, stop right there.
19:34:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, nevermind.
19:36:14 <Toves> I haven't done anything yet.
19:36:39 <TheJollyRoger> Nah, belay my last, it's just me getting a bit paranoid :P.
19:37:07 <TheJollyRoger> What I'd probably say though,
19:37:11 <TheJollyRoger> is to do it through the Android SDK.
19:37:25 <TheJollyRoger> This way, you're getting stuff direct from upstream.
19:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> Actually, no, shit, yeah, that website lists a driver on a shady filesharing site.
19:37:58 <TheJollyRoger> I wanted to read a little closer, glad I did.
19:38:00 <Toves> I was going to ask about that.
19:38:08 <Toves> I was a bit apprehensive.
19:38:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, do it through the Android SDK.
19:38:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a second.
19:38:43 <Toves> Are there instructions for installing Android SDK on the official page, or just wing it?
19:38:49 <TheJollyRoger> https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
19:39:00 <Toves> Okay
19:39:18 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to get the android SDK, here:
19:39:42 <TheJollyRoger> https://developer.android.com/studio/install
19:39:55 <Toves> Thanks
19:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> From there, you'll need to follow the steps to get it or keep it up todate.
19:40:00 <TheJollyRoger> *up to date.
19:41:06 * TheJollyRoger lets out a long, loud breath.
19:41:49 <Toves> (If this doesn't work, I'm going to switch to my Linux Mint computer, but I'm a noob with Linux.)
19:42:30 <TheJollyRoger> Toves: I'd probably suggest Ubuntu 20.04 -- if you do decide to go this route, it's very important that you don't use the adb included with Ubuntu, and you add the udev rules.
19:42:43 <Toves> Okay.
19:42:44 <TheJollyRoger> (the adb/fastboot included with Ubuntu will result in a softbrick)
19:43:26 <Toves> Okay, let's try the windows route first...
19:43:28 <TheJollyRoger> The udev rules are required to permit the computer to talk through udev to the fastboot, otherwise it will hang at "<waiting for device>"
19:43:36 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
19:43:49 <TheJollyRoger> I have to go for the time being.
19:43:52 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck.
19:44:00 <Toves> That's what I've been getting all along... "Waiting for any device." Thanks for the help!
19:44:35 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome. Good luck, and welcome (back) aboard the ship in advance!
19:47:20 <Toves> It looks like the link that TheJollyRoger gave me is for a Windows installation of both fastboot and adb. That's okay, right? As long as I don't attempt to flash the OS using adb?
19:51:56 <mulbr[m]> Sure, just follow the instructions and copy paste
19:57:28 <TheJollyRoger> Just jumped back on for a sec. Toves - you won't be able to flash using adb. ADB is for talking to the operating system. Fastboot, is for talking to the bootloader. They are two separate tools, for two separate jobs.
19:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> Think of it as like using a screwdriver for turning a screw, and a wrench for turning a nut.
19:59:20 <TheJollyRoger> adb can help in that it can make one step easier: rebooting to your boot loader, so you don't have to use that annoying combo key.
19:59:31 <TheJollyRoger> Outside of that, it plays no role in installing GrapheneOS.
19:59:48 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, two steps: it can tell you if your phone is the type that can be unlocked.
20:00:17 <TheJollyRoger> But outside of that, it's all on Fastboot to do the flashing.
20:00:47 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, I have to run. Be back later.
20:02:20 <TheJollyRoger> Er, to answer your question, whoops, aside from the extra couple of megabytes of space it takes up, there is no consequence to having adb installed. It won't interfere with the process, but it won't help outside of those two use cases.
20:05:51 <mike_of_earth> So... anyone tried to build for the pixel 5 yet? I think I noticed the build targets list is updated and now includes the 5?
20:52:41 <freeasfreedom69> Hi everyone , can I ask you if create an user profil to browse and then deleting it everytime, give you the same anonimity as TOR
20:54:29 <strcat[m]> apples to oranges comparison
20:57:20 <freeasfreedom69> Can I ask you why , because I'm really ignorant , I'm trying to educate myself but it takes a lot , age is not on my side ahah
20:58:15 <strcat[m]> Tor is an onion routing network
20:58:23 <strcat[m]> wiping a profile is wiping data
20:58:41 <strcat[m]> it's like asking if using Incognito mode or wiping the browser data achieves the same thing
20:58:45 <strcat[m]> apples to oranges comparison
20:59:02 <strcat[m]> you're comparing 2 totally different things
20:59:44 <tidria[m]> What is the use case? it at least gives insight into why one offers value over the other
20:59:59 <strcat[m]> they aren't alternatives
21:00:04 <tidria[m]> but like previously mentioned there is no overlap in the application
21:00:05 <strcat[m]> it's an apples to oranges comparison that doesn't make sense
21:01:28 <freeasfreedom69> but everything that tracks the user will eventually track nothing? When i delete?
21:02:30 <tidria[m]> I think you need to be clear on "what" you believe you are deleting
21:02:51 <freeasfreedom69> Yes please
21:02:57 <tidria[m]> deleting the profile would delete local files not clear a digital footprint you made while using it
21:03:20 <freeasfreedom69> ah ok
21:03:53 <strcat[m]> deleting the profile as a whole is just a more reliable way of wiping all the local data permanently
21:03:53 <tidria[m]> using tor could safeguard you in your digital footprint- pretty reductive explanation though
21:03:54 <strcat[m]> if you used incognito mode it wouldn't have stored that data in the first place
21:03:54 <strcat[m]> the Tor Browser uses a mode like that by default
21:06:17 <strcat[m]> you can also just wipe the data stored by the app, the advantage of wiping a profile as a whole is preventing it from ever being physically recovered
21:06:39 <freeasfreedom69> aaaaaa I see
21:06:41 <strcat[m]> see https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption which explains this
21:07:09 <strcat[m]> using the same network connection from different profiles will still let you be identified based on your network connection
21:07:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> btw srcat check the dev chat
21:07:38 <strcat[m]> the purpose of user profiles is that they are each an isolated workspace with their own app data, profile data and apps can't share data or communicate across them
21:07:58 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound relevant to what you are talking about
21:08:08 <freeasfreedom69> Perfect
21:10:42 <freeasfreedom69> I actually read the FAQ before , but I misunderstand this string  "Sensitive data is stored in user profiles. User profiles each have their own unique, randomly generated disk encryption key and their own unique key encryption key is used to encrypt it"
21:10:54 <seashield[m]>  strcat  anupritaisno1   I want to report a potentially concerning bug. When I switch from a secondary profile to the owner profile by tapping end session, I get a freeze on the lock screen of the last window that was open in the secondary profile.
21:11:23 * seashield[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210123-174013.png (321KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TMmSQpklnOghoxNfbPWoFRtC/Screenshot_20210123-174013.png >
21:11:25 <strcat> seashield[m]: it's a minor upstream display issue
21:11:35 <strcat> seashield[m]: has already been reported upstream and is being worked on for AOSP
21:11:41 <strcat> this isn't a good place to report issues
21:11:58 <strcat> should use the issue tracker and check for existing issues first
21:12:13 <seashield[m]> OK, good to know. Thanks.
21:12:49 <strcat[m]> it switches profiles while it's killing off the old profile and there's a display issue where a race can happen
21:13:03 <strcat[m]> it's because of how end session works
21:13:15 <strcat[m]> it doesn't wait long enough for it to finish before switching the displayed profile
21:13:22 <strcat[m]> it's not a major issue
21:13:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> something something porn shows on screen i bet
21:13:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> lol
21:14:59 <seashield[m]> anupritaisno1 luckily, I was "studying" the GOS website when this happened.
21:15:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <seashield[m] "anupritaisno1 luckily, I was "st"> yep. salacious, you are
21:15:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> anyway i gotta go
21:15:54 <strcat> just keep in mind that end session sometimes leaves the currently displayed screen due to it prematurely switching to displaying another profile
21:15:54 <seashield[m]> strcat thanks for the info, reassuring to hear it's not a major issue.
21:16:02 <strcat> it's already reported to AOSP by us
21:16:47 <strcat> and was acknowledged as a legitimate issue with minor security implications that is being worked on
21:17:03 <strcat> just need to be patient, usually takes ~80 days to fix an issue like this upstream for a stable release
21:17:10 <strcat> don't remember when we reported it
21:18:16 <freeasfreedom69> Saying that user profile can  work "similar" to qubes , is correctly?
21:18:34 <sahelea[m]> Hey guys, just out of interest, does someone of you own Cellebrite UFED ? I am curios what this tool would be able to extract out of a pixel with graphene os.
21:18:53 <strcat> sahelea[m]: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
21:19:08 <strcat> also, in general, those devices require unlocking, enabling developer options, enabling adb and whitelisting the key
21:19:46 <strcat> think you're misunderstanding what it offers them, it's not a magical tool that has exploits for every device, it can primarily only actually exploit devices without security updates
21:19:53 <sahelea[m]> Hm thank you, good to know but How does police etc read out phones them?
21:19:56 <strcat> so, don't use devices without full security updates
21:20:12 <strcat> sahelea[m]: by entering the password to unlock, enabling dev options, enabling adb and whitelisting the device to perform extraction
21:20:14 <strcat> as I said
21:20:22 <sahelea[m]> Oh ok thanks
21:20:56 <strcat> look at their documentation which has been published in various places - that's what they refer to as their extraction capabilities
21:21:13 <strcat> having an exploit for a device is above and beyond the usual baseline of what it offers
21:21:35 <strcat> and as I said, they usually don't have that for an up-to-date device, so all the more reason to not use devices without full security updates
21:21:46 <strcat> and to make sure you're updating promptly
21:22:24 <strcat> the whole point of GrapheneOS is improving privacy/security of the OS and that includes preventing exploitation of common classes of vulnerabilities, etc.
21:22:42 <strcat> so in a case where they actually do temporarily have an exploit, a lot of what GrapheneOS does is aimed at stopping that from working for it
21:22:53 <strcat> but you seem confused about what their capabilities actually are and what they offer
21:23:36 <strcat> as usual, I recommend not getting information on technical things from non-technical sources that are primarily spreading press releases, misinformation and misunderstandings
21:23:39 <strcat> and then propagating that from each other
21:24:02 <strcat> you aren't educating yourself by reading the news and following what non-experts say about topics
21:24:15 <strcat> and not just when it comes to phone security
21:24:49 <strcat> find experts that are actually knowledgeable, who acknowledge the limits of their expertise and are good at communicating it
21:25:21 <strcat> journalists are usually a terrible source of information - they rarely have a good understanding of the topics and most news stories, etc. are just based on each other, propagating information via broken telephone
21:25:29 <strcat> whole lot of misunderstanding about what these extraction tools actually do
21:25:42 <sahelea[m]> Cool, thanks a lot. Yeah i could find much information about cellebrite or what tools police is using.
21:26:40 <strcat> they list support for devices where they can perform extraction after the password is entered
21:27:25 <strcat> exploiting the OS to extract data without that is a separate thing
21:27:54 <strcat> by supporting extraction from a device, what they are saying is if the police enter the password, and follow their instructions, it can extract data with adb / local backup support
21:28:02 <strcat> it is not an interesting capability
21:28:11 <strcat> it's just a guided way of using adb for clueless people
21:31:45 <sahelea[m]> Hm, wow
21:32:03 * sahelea[m] uploaded an image: Imagepipe_6.jpg (55KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XQawFvyPdwqBOgNqQqziBwkD/Imagepipe_6.jpg >
21:32:12 <sahelea[m]> This is what they claim on their website
21:32:23 * sahelea[m] uploaded an image: Imagepipe_5.jpg (16KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gavppxWuPrRnJODlyXhQVIqW/Imagepipe_5.jpg >
21:34:52 <strcat> sahelea[m]: which doesn't say conflict with anything I just said
21:35:33 <strcat> exploiting devices without security updates applied, similar exploits via adb access to obtain more data than they're supposed to be able to via adb, etc.
21:36:16 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Vanadium doesn't support extensions, does it?
21:36:25 <strcat> doesn't and won't support extensions
21:37:01 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Then why would you use it if you can't even have uBlock Origin on it?
21:37:15 <strcat> the aim is improving privacy and security, including implementing anti-fingerprinting
21:37:21 <strcat> extensions are counter to the purpose of it
21:37:40 <strcat> content filtering belongs built-in
21:37:47 <strcat> recommend looking at the planned enhancements for it
21:37:49 <dxrwzy9y[m]> While not allowing adblock which prevents tracking?
21:37:54 <strcat> you're welcome to contribute
21:38:04 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: read what I wrote
21:38:04 <quartz11[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Then why would you use it if you"> you can use bromite which has an adblock
21:38:14 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: read what I wrote and look at the planned enhancements for it
21:38:16 <strcat> you're welcome to contribute
21:38:18 <sahelea[m]> So does this mean the device has to be in an unlocked state or just in the State after rebooting?
21:38:30 * sahelea[m] uploaded an image: Imagepipe_8.jpg (40KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UZUPzKzinSjFkwzVoDiOgJwh/Imagepipe_8.jpg >
21:38:37 <strcat> extensions are in no way required to support content filtering
21:38:45 <strcat> and are not how we are going to approach things like that
21:38:55 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Right but how is it better than just using Firefox/Fennec then? Which does support extensions.
21:39:07 <strcat> read the information available on the site
21:39:12 <strcat> Firefox is incredibly insecure
21:39:20 <strcat> extensions are in no way required to do content filtering
21:39:31 <strcat> content filtering does not fundamentally improve browser privacy either, it is enumerating badness, like antivirus
21:39:44 <strcat> Tor Browser doesn't do it for a reason: it would hurt anonymity by enabling fingerprinting
21:39:53 <strcat> and fundamentally isn't a workable approach to privacy
21:40:34 <strcat> blacklisting things is unworkable as an approach to privacy/security beyond harm reduction in the short term
21:40:47 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <strcat "Firefox is incredibly insecure"> By extensions you're saying Tor Browser is insecure then lol
21:40:48 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: please read the information on our site 1st
21:40:51 <strcat> it suggests Bromite
21:41:00 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: you're not supposed to install more extensions in Tor Browser
21:41:03 <strcat> or change configuration
21:41:10 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Does Bromite support ublock?
21:41:10 <strcat> it defeats the purpose of it
21:41:17 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: it has built-in content blocking
21:41:18 <freeasfreedom69> dxrwzy9y[m] secure and privacy are different
21:41:31 <strcat> freeasfreedom69: that is not what was my response said
21:41:34 <strcat> again
21:41:36 <strcat> 16:40:34          @strcat | blacklisting things is unworkable as an approach to privacy/security beyond harm reduction in the short term
21:41:40 <strcat> 16:39:30          @strcat | content filtering does not fundamentally improve browser privacy either, it is enumerating badness, like antivirus
21:41:42 <strcat> 16:39:44          @strcat | Tor Browser doesn't do it for a reason: it would hurt anonymity by enabling fingerprinting
21:41:43 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <strcat "dxrwzy9y: you're not supposed to"> I know that, you said Firefox as a whole is insecure which Tor Browser is based on.
21:41:44 <strcat> 16:39:53          @strcat | and fundamentally isn't a workable approach to privacy
21:41:46 <strcat> freeasfreedom69: please read what I wrote
21:41:52 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: Tor Browser has very bad security
21:41:59 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: it can be used to bypass the anonymity it attempts to provide
21:42:02 <strcat> it's a problem
21:42:08 <freeasfreedom69> strcat was answer "By extensions you're saying Tor Browser is insecure then lol"
21:42:31 <strcat> you aren't supposed to install extensions in the Tor Browser
21:42:33 <strcat> or change configuration
21:43:00 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Again I know, it's still Firefox though which you claim to be insecure.
21:43:02 <strcat> it's a serious UI issue with it that they make it so easy and comfortable to break the anonymity it attempts to provide by doing that
21:43:04 <freeasfreedom69> I think tor browser IS insecure but is the best browser for privacy (i can be wrong)
21:43:07 <bypassbobby[m]> Everything should be left as is to avoid finger printing.
21:43:17 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: which I already elaborated on in my response
21:43:29 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: please read the information on our site before bringing it up here
21:44:01 <strcat> and don't concern troll
21:44:26 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Would you say the same is true on desktop then? Do you suggest we all use Brave?
21:44:33 <Elementoshi[m]> Is there something similar to Moto Gestures for GrapheneOS? I like being able to turn on the flashlight on my phone with just a simple flick of the wrist
21:44:40 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I don't really get the Mozilla hate these days.
21:44:50 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: yes, the same thing is true elsewhere, and no that doesn't mean I recommend BRave
21:45:12 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: explaining that Firefox has bad security and that extensions are problematic due to fingerprinting and various other privacy/security issues is not 'Mozilla hate'
21:45:23 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: concern trolling and misrepresenting other people's statements will result in a ban from this channel
21:45:36 <Elementoshi[m]> How does the Tor Browser have bad security?
21:45:47 <strcat> Elementoshi[m]: please read the information available on our site and elsewhere
21:46:03 <Elementoshi[m]> About the Tor Browser/
21:46:07 <strcat> yes
21:46:22 <strcat> we can't repeat what we write in our documentation and more thorough answers for each person that asks
21:46:23 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <Elementoshi[m] "How does the Tor Browser have ba"> Yeah that's what makes this hard to understand to me.
21:46:24 <strcat> it's impractical
21:46:35 <Elementoshi[m]> Okay. Is it just about Tor Browser for Android, or Tor Browser for desktop too?
21:46:38 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: please read the information that's available
21:46:44 <freeasfreedom69> For the record , I said security and privacy are different to answer dxrwzy9y[m] "By extensions you're saying Tor Browser is insecure then lol"
21:46:50 <strcat> Elementoshi[m]: in general, but *particularly* on mobile
21:46:54 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: the TLDR is that Firefox doesn't do internal sandboxing, and has an "all your eggs in one basket" approach to processes. It makes no effort to segregate them from each other.
21:47:02 <strcat> freeasfreedom69: it's a misleading statement
21:47:06 <strcat> and misrepresents what I was saying
21:47:12 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <freeasfreedom69 "For the record , I said security"> Okay but ideally you wanna have both.
21:47:23 <TheJollyRoger> For more details and nuance, you can read about what he's written.
21:47:24 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: it is a misrepresentation of what I was saying
21:47:31 <strcat> and is misleading, as I said
21:47:51 <freeasfreedom69> I was not answer your speech, separate sorry if it looks like
21:48:08 * Elementoshi[m] begins searching through https://grapheneos.org/ for information about the Tor Browser
21:48:09 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is it possible to use Bitwarden in Vanadium btw?
21:48:35 <strcat> Elementoshi[m]: there's a section on web browsing where Vanadium and Bromite are the recommended browsers
21:48:40 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Or do you have to manually copy/paste?
21:48:42 <strcat> and it explains why
21:49:02 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: password managers can implement a keyboard or autofill service
21:49:06 <strcat> they don't need a browser extension
21:50:41 <freeasfreedom69> When he says "By extensions you're saying Tor Browser is insecure then lol" , I just answer my point of view (which i think is true) and was not related at what you were saying
21:50:53 <strcat> Vanadium is intended to provide similar functionality as Bromite but it will take time to develop in a way that we consider appropriate
21:51:22 <strcat> you can use Bromite for now to have a secure browser with features like content filtering and more aggressive (not necessarily in a positive way) anti-fingerprinting
21:51:35 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <strcat "Vanadium is intended to provide "> What are the differences between them?
21:52:14 <strcat> Vanadium is specifically for GrapheneOS and is taking more time to implement the same desired features because we have stricter constraints on how we want it to be done
21:52:21 <strcat> we share ideas and patches with the Bromite project
21:52:32 <dxrwzy9y[m]> What about the DuckDuckGo app btw?
21:52:35 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium aims to camouflauge itself by passing itself off as a regular Pixel Handset in order to blend in better and provide cover traffic. It is very closely matched with the operating system for this reason.
21:52:35 <strcat> see the Vanadium issue tracker for some of the planned features
21:52:48 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: much less secure and doesn't really have advantages
21:52:57 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: that's covered in the docs on the site
21:53:05 <strcat> WebView-based browsers are covered
21:53:28 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: in the long term we'll stop doing that though but we don't have a million users atm
21:53:32 <TheJollyRoger> The worst thing you can do is attempt to custom tune, which makes it quite obvious to a site that actually /is/ hostile that you're spoofing or have custom tuned.
21:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: understood.
21:54:02 <strcat> and it will always be important for it to avoid having a different fingerprint between users - including varying configuration, extensions, extension configuration, extension state, etc.
21:54:07 <freeasfreedom69> Actually in part was related beacuse i said , as you  , that beacuse firefox is insecure, then TOR is insecure too, BUT is the best browser to have privacy
21:54:08 <strcat> extensions cause a lot of privacy and security issues
21:54:18 <strcat> freeasfreedom69: no, it's not really the best browser for privacy
21:54:22 <strcat> it's a lot more nuanced than that
21:54:52 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <strcat "extensions cause a lot of privac"> Depends on the specific extension though, no?
21:55:11 <TheJollyRoger> freeasfreedom69: he didn't say that Tor itself is insecure. Tor and Tor Browser are two components of the overall bundle.
21:55:15 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: an extension that's doing anything with site content is inherently hurting privacy via fingerprinting
21:55:40 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: and is adding substantial attack surface - and they don't fit properly into how browsers do isolation between sites, etc.
21:56:08 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: so, for example, Chromium has site isolation: sites run in isolated processes, even if an attacker successfully exploits the renderer, if the site is appropriately configured it remains isolated from other site data, etc.
21:56:13 <freeasfreedom69> TheJollyRoger if Firefox is insecure by implication TOR browser is insecure?
21:56:18 <strcat> but extensions bypass site isolation
21:56:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: check matrix dms
21:56:29 <TheJollyRoger> freeasfreedom69: The browser is insecure.
21:56:45 <strcat> an extension with access to site data has that across all sites, via one extension process
21:56:48 <freeasfreedom69> TheJollyRoger I write tor meaning tor browser i conceed
21:56:51 <strcat> extensions don't fit properly into the sandboxing model
21:57:00 <strcat> even if properly written, they open up side channel privacy leaks
21:57:02 <dxrwzy9y[m]> What do you use on a desktop then that doesn't require extensions to block trackers? The only thing that comes to mind is Brave which had it's fair share of controversies.
21:57:06 <strcat> and inherently cause fingerprinting issues
21:57:18 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: enumerating badness is not a viable approach to achieving real privacy
21:57:22 <EXODIA> Good Evening
21:57:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy EXODIA
21:58:01 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: real privacy is achieved through properly splitting site data based on origins, mitigating fingerprint and using a shared network connection with other users with the same fingerprint
21:58:15 <strcat> the last part is what Tor / VPNs attempt to provide
21:58:17 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I mean seriously, what do you recommend to use on desktop? What do you personally use?
21:58:29 <strcat> I don't make recommendations about desktop usage
21:58:33 <strcat> particularly not in this channel
21:58:50 <TheJollyRoger> dxrwzy9y[m]: you don't, since that itself opens you up to be enumerated by which trackers you've blocked.
21:58:54 <strcat> if you use a port of GrapheneOS on your desktop, then my recommendation is Vanadium or Bromite
21:59:10 <Elementoshi[m]> Does Vanadium use Tor?
21:59:13 <TheJollyRoger> *opens you up to being tracked by enumerating which trackers you've blocked, or attempted to.
21:59:20 <strcat> Elementoshi[m]: you can use it with Tor, it doesn't inherently use it / integrate it
21:59:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> ah yes let's build vanadium x86-64
21:59:29 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: we have a prebuilt for x86_64
21:59:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "anupritaisno1: we have a prebuil"> not for windows also just sarcasm
21:59:57 <strcat> Vanadium essentially has official releases for both arm64 and x86_64
22:00:10 <strcat> it's intended to be used in GrapheneOS though
22:00:14 <EXODIA> Question on https://grapheneos.org/install.. using pshell (non-admin) i get all the way to running ./flash-all.bat however i get the following text..

22:00:38 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: yes lot of people pinging me and messaging me
22:00:42 <EXODIA> im guessing update requires sunfish and im on coral
22:00:47 <EXODIA> obviously
22:00:47 <TheJollyRoger> EXODIA: which handset are you connecting?
22:00:53 <EXODIA> pixel 4xl
22:00:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> for some reason it forgot the host key and i need to upload to testers
22:00:59 <strcat> EXODIA: you should be using the coral releases then
22:01:01 <strcat> not sunfish
22:01:06 <EXODIA> dur
22:01:08 <TheJollyRoger> You are using the wrong image. Sunfish is for 4a.
22:01:09 <EXODIA> my bad
22:01:11 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <strcat "Vanadium essentially has officia"> Has anyone ported it yet?
22:01:23 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: Vanadium has official arm64 / x86_64 support
22:01:24 <EXODIA> (slams head in desk)
22:01:26 <strcat> it works fine there
22:01:34 <strcat> I don't know if Bromite does
22:01:36 <TheJollyRoger> EXODIA: really good that you didn't try this on a 4a5G, the 4a5G doesn't do auto detection, and doing this with the 4a5G will result in a permanent hardbrick.
22:01:37 <EXODIA> (Re-trying)
22:01:39 <strcat> Vanadium is for use in GrapheneOS
22:01:42 <freeasfreedom69> strcat [22:54:18] <strcat> freeasfreedom69: no, it's not really the best browser for privacy
22:01:42 <freeasfreedom69> [22:54:22] <strcat> it's a lot more nuanced than that
22:01:47 <strcat> Bromite is for use more broadly on any Android compatible OS
22:01:59 <EXODIA> TheJollyRoger thank god.. retrying with correct image now
22:02:03 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is there any reason why it isn't available on F-Droid?
22:02:09 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: which?
22:02:23 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Vanadium
22:02:25 <strcat> Vanadium depends on GrapheneOS changes, it's not intended to be used elsewhere
22:02:36 <strcat> also it's not up to us what F-Droid includes in their official repo
22:02:44 <TheJollyRoger> It likely won't work properly on operating systems that aren't GrapheneOS.
22:03:00 <TheJollyRoger> Or if it does, it may not operate the way it was intended to.
22:03:02 <o9l[m]> wait im about to flash and i read that now im paranoid
22:03:07 <o9l[m]> coral is 4xl, yes?
22:03:12 <strcat> yes
22:03:15 <o9l[m]> ok
22:03:16 <strcat> it says on the releases page
22:03:16 <TheJollyRoger> o91 Coral is 4XL.
22:03:18 <o9l[m]> good
22:03:42 <o9l[m]> i know but i read "hard brick" and my heart rate went up
22:04:03 <strcat> we have information on browsers on the site and there are important reasons for why we have the recommendations that we do
22:04:10 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: you'll be fine as long as you match the correct image to the correct device.
22:04:29 <strcat> it can make sense to use the Tor Browser but be aware of it being particularly vulnerable to exploitation
22:04:49 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: and make sure you don't disconnect or interrupt the phone before it's done. If you're on Windows, wait for Fastboot to tell you to press any key to exit.
22:04:52 <strcat> and Tor makes you into a target for exploitation - either via an exit node or an onion service that's malicious/compromised
22:04:53 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay fine, I guess I'll give Vanadium a try then. Never really used it as I'm a big FF fan haha
22:05:06 <TheJollyRoger> dxrwzy9y[m]: I know, it can be a bit of a shock, I felt the same way at first too.
22:05:06 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: you'll probably be happier with Bromite if you want content filtering today
22:05:18 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: Vanadium has a roadmap that includes supporting it
22:05:35 <strcat> we may collaborate more closely with Bromite to get this stuff done
22:05:47 <strcat> we have stricter requirements
22:05:48 <dxrwzy9y[m]> It'll just come bundled in a Graphene update, right?
22:05:50 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: place your phone flat on the desk and make sure the connections are nice and snug. As tempting as it may be, don't disturb the phone until Fastboot in the console tells you it's done and to press any key to exit.
22:05:51 <strcat> for the features
22:05:54 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: yes
22:06:03 <o9l[m]> on linux, making sure not to press any keys in the terminal because if i mess this phone up
22:06:07 <strcat> dxrwzy9y[m]: Bromite uses the built-in content filtering engine
22:06:09 <strcat> which is what we want to do
22:06:13 <strcat> but the approach is not quite what we want
22:06:18 <strcat> and we take the time to do things the right way
22:06:20 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: Got it, on Linux it will exit for you and return to the shell.
22:06:23 <strcat> we avoid taking shortcuts, generally
22:06:28 <o9l[m]> sounds good
22:06:34 <strcat> one problem with doing that and then people lose interest in helping to get it done
22:06:42 <strcat> because they'll accept an 80% solution with issues
22:06:52 <strcat> we care a lot about doing things properly
22:06:59 <strcat> means we need more time to get stuff done
22:07:16 <strcat> so, for example, I think people will be really impressed with our GrapheneOS installer when that's published soon
22:07:17 <o9l[m]> is it supposed to just not say anything?
22:07:38 <strcat> avoids needing to run any additional software beyond our site
22:07:38 <o9l[m]> its not printing anything out to the terminal
22:07:42 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: hang on a sec.
22:08:39 <freeasfreedom69> strcat adding video tutorial on the site is a viable option? asking for a friend
22:08:40 <TheJollyRoger> https://asciinema.org/a/qVCcAFPUMheCIPejb6EwjXow4 Here's the entire process, actually.
22:08:57 <TheJollyRoger> freeasfreedom69: see the link on asciinema.org, I've just posted it.
22:09:08 <TheJollyRoger> That's a live process of the installation.
22:09:17 <freeasfreedom69> IS this telepathy?
22:09:37 <o9l[m]> uhh, literally nothing is being printed out
22:09:42 <o9l[m]> its just stuck
22:09:57 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: hit CTRL-C and wait for it to exit. It may have hung.
22:09:59 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Should I disable do not track? Heard it can be used to fingerprint people.
22:10:08 <freeasfreedom69> TheJollyRoger This trip me more than lsd
22:10:09 <o9l[m]> okay
22:10:26 <o9l[m]> scared to do that cause i didnt want anything bad to happen
22:10:50 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: she should be alright if fastboot has taken no action.
22:10:59 <TheJollyRoger> Could you do the following for me, with your phone plugged in and switched onto Fastboot:
22:11:08 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version && fastboot devices
22:11:17 <TheJollyRoger> This will print your device serial and username,
22:11:18 <o9l[m]> i hit control c and its not doing anthing
22:11:23 <o9l[m]> it just printed control c
22:12:48 <TheJollyRoger> Give it a minute or so. If it won't become unstuck, close the command window but don't unplug your phone.
22:12:59 <o9l[m]> okay
22:13:17 <o9l[m]> its been like 3 minutes, is it safe to just force quit the terminal window now?
22:13:19 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Should I disable do not track? H"> ?
22:13:20 <strcat[m]> freeasfreedom69: no, we're not going to have a video tutorial, it's impractical to update it for every change that's made to the guide
22:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: before you do, look at your phone, is fastboot still on?
22:13:36 <strcat[m]> freeasfreedom69: we're going to have an WebUSB-based installer for people uncomfortable with using the CLI
22:13:45 <o9l[m]> it says fastboot mode so i think so
22:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: you're OK then.
22:14:06 <o9l[m]> okay
22:14:15 <strcat[m]> and it makes more sense to use a WebUSB-based installer for anyone that's not using fastboot / signify from their OS provider to verify and flash without relying on third party software
22:14:39 <strcat[m]> if you're trusting the instructions and the download from our server
22:14:39 <strcat[m]> you might as well just the performing the flashing with the web page
22:14:42 <strcat[m]> which is what we're going to be offering
22:14:47 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: It may have hung because fastboot is not being allowed to talk to the device.
22:14:58 <strcat[m]> avoids needing to run any software beyond your browser, avoids trusting additional parties
22:15:05 <TheJollyRoger> We can run a quick sanity check with the following command:
22:15:09 <strcat[m]> avoids all these misguided unofficial guides with sketchy third party software and workarounds
22:15:12 <o9l[m]> ok
22:15:15 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version && fastboot devices
22:15:27 <TheJollyRoger> Note that fastboot *must* be in your command path in order to do so.
22:15:34 <o9l[m]> fastboot version 30.0.5
22:15:34 <o9l[m]> Installed as /usr/bin/fastboot
22:15:34 <o9l[m]> 98251FFBA000C3	fastboot
22:15:54 <freeasfreedom69> strcat my dream, only worst than having a device ready on your online shop in a few year :P
22:16:01 * TheJollyRoger frowns.
22:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> freeasfreedom69: we don't sell devices at this point in time, unfortunately. It's a bit of a hassle and liability to handle people's personal information, and then have to worry about the occasional device getting lost or stolen or charged back.
22:17:22 <o9l[m]> should i just try again? what step would i pick up on if i do?
22:17:28 <freeasfreedom69> TheJollyRoger u will have in a few year i'm sure
22:17:45 <EXODIA> that did the tricks boys, looking good so far...super stoked on this build.. been a long time since i did any of this.. last time was.. samsung galaxy s2 days..
22:17:55 <freeasfreedom69> becuase when a project is built well it can only succeed
22:18:09 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: I think someone more knowledgable than I will have to help you out unfortunately. Version 30.0.5 is correct, and it looks like it's detected the phone right...
22:18:22 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "TheJollyRoger: in the long term "> Do you have a rough estimate of the current amount of GrapheneOS users?
22:18:30 <TheJollyRoger> You're using Arch or Manjaro, I'm assuming?
22:18:38 <o9l[m]> yes, manjaro
22:18:42 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I could make a rough estimate based on checks for updates but I don't
22:18:45 <o9l[m]> how'd ya nkow?
22:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> EXODIA: Yarr, welcome aboard the ship!
22:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: Only Arch (and distributions based on it) correctly version and have up-to-date fastboot packages and package them for the OS.
22:20:02 <TheJollyRoger> So I can see you've got the right one installed to /usr/bin.
22:20:03 <o9l[m]> ah, that makes sense
22:20:51 <TheJollyRoger> I'm a tad bit stumped - sometimes this kind of thing gets caused by the computer wigging out on certain USB ports, or not implementing full traces on USB-C.
22:20:56 <TheJollyRoger> So as odd as this is gonna sound...
22:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> Try switching cables or USB ports.
22:21:13 <TheJollyRoger> If you can, use an A-to-C port.
22:21:15 <o9l[m]> question from someone very uninformed:  when i was using my phone in my car for the first time, i noticed something called "android auto". does that work with grapheneos or is it a google services thing
22:21:21 <TheJollyRoger> That's the only idea I have at this point.
22:21:30 <strcat[m]> o9l: Play services thing although it could potentially be reimplemented
22:21:41 <strcat[m]> o9l: since it's a standard that doesn't really depend on Play services
22:21:58 <strcat[m]> o9l: it's basically an alternate UI + a way to screen cast it
22:22:06 <o9l[m]> hm ok, i only have the one usbc cable. what do i need to do to be safe to unplug my phone?
22:22:14 <TheJollyRoger> Er, sorry, o9l[m] I mean, use a USB-A to C cable, plugged directly into the back of your computer, if you are using a desktop.
22:22:32 <strcat[m]> o9l:  it's safe to unplug if you're not currently in the process of flashing
22:22:34 <o9l[m]> <strcat[m] "o9l: it's basically an alternate"> oh thats pretty cool, be sick to see that work one day. spotify in the car is a must have haha, but i can do it through usb
22:22:44 <strcat[m]> o9l: if you've already had issues occur during flashing then I recommend rebooting back to the bootloader menu
22:22:46 <EXODIA> TheJollyRoger Much appreciated.. now to transition from all my gmail to proton..fun
22:23:00 <strcat[m]> because the state of the fastboot interface will have been messed up by an incomplete flash
22:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> You're safe now. The only reason I didn't want you to unplug your phone was because I wanted to try to see if it was talking to your device.
22:23:12 <strcat[m]> so you need to reboot back to the bootloader menu
22:23:19 <strcat[m]> if it has been screwed up and you need to start over
22:23:33 <o9l[m]> ok, so just restart the phone like normal? do i need to re lock the bootloader?
22:23:36 <strcat[m]> not strictly necessary but a good way to eliminate the previous issue from continuing to cause problems
22:23:44 <strcat[m]> o9l: I'm confused by what you're asking now
22:23:46 <TheJollyRoger> EXODIA: Good luck!
22:23:50 <strcat[m]> you're trying to flash GrapheneOS, right?
22:24:04 <o9l[m]> yes
22:24:06 <strcat[m]> reboot back to the bootloader menu, plug it into a different port and go through the flashing instructions again
22:24:14 <strcat[m]> you don't need to lock again
22:24:16 <strcat[m]> until you finish flashing
22:24:22 <strcat[m]> only lock when you finish flashing
22:24:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. we've found that some vendors don't actually adequately trace their USB ports. I don't know why this is, but sometimes stuff gets really wiggy with USB.
22:24:44 <o9l[m]> okay, sorry i've never used android or done anything like this before. rather inexperienced
22:24:55 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: no problem! Just take it slowly.
22:26:09 <o9l[m]> ok, i've plugged my phone back in. anything need to be done again or am i save to just go back to typing flash all
22:26:17 <strcat> o9l[m]: make sure the cable is unplugged in really snugly to the computer
22:26:30 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure both ends are really snug and set the phone flat on your desk.
22:26:31 <o9l[m]> sure is
22:26:41 <strcat> o9l[m]: yes just try again
22:26:51 <o9l[m]> okay, wish me luck
22:26:56 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, luck!
22:27:41 <freeasfreedom69> TheJollyRoger in the tutorial did you use ubuntu?
22:27:45 <o9l[m]> hm, not doing anything yet...
22:28:11 <TheJollyRoger> freeasfreedom69: Ah that's not me in the tutorial.
22:28:50 <o9l[m]> yeah it seems like its hung again
22:29:46 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, I'm stumped.
22:30:36 <o9l[m]> well, another question i guess. i know this phone has radar features. do those work on grapheneos or nah. not that i can get them to work on the stock os anyways 🙃
22:31:21 <TheJollyRoger> Come to think of it I never checked...
22:32:48 <mrmccall[m]> How does CalyX compare to Graphene?
22:34:02 <TheJollyRoger> mrmccall[m]: Calyx aims for compatibility with apps dependent on Google's services. At GrapheneOS, the view is more that Google services are invasive, and implementing a handler built via reverse-engineering is not a viable alternative to them.
22:34:58 <o9l[m]> semi-related: i got one of those privacy screen protectors so people cant see my phone from the side and its one of the best phone accesories i've ever bought
22:35:03 <o9l[m]> it works wonderfully
22:35:11 <TheJollyRoger> Calyx also aims for more compatibility, with GrapheneOS holding the view that we should not permit insecure applications, and that it's OK to ditch backwards compatibility to mitigate exploits, reduce attack surface, and disallow insecure API calls.
22:35:51 <freeasfreedom69> Do somone know if somone is selling smartphone case that cover cameras? (pixel), i heard of it a lot but can't find it
22:36:14 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS aims to do deep, thorough hardening of the software stack, including a complete rewrite of the way memory is handled and processes are spawned to prevent apps from stealing each others' secrets and exploiting the OS. Calyx doesn't do this, because in Calyx's philosophy, such changes would interfere with compatibility.
22:36:25 <o9l[m]> ok so i wanna just boot back into the stock os for now, can i just restart and type the command to lock the bootloader?
22:36:31 <o9l[m]> until someone can help me
22:36:49 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m], yes.
22:36:58 <o9l[m]> okay cool
22:37:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's likely that fastboot didn't see your phone, silently errored out, and did nothing.
22:37:25 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know why this happened yet :(
22:37:39 <mrmccall[m]> Okay, makes sense. Thanks.
22:39:01 <o9l[m]> agh, now i have to add my contacts again so i can text people whilst im waiting
22:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: sorry to hear it didn't work out this time!
22:39:54 <TheJollyRoger> You should be able to import and export your contact lists via import/export to vcf in both the contact apps in GrapheneOS and the Google OS.
22:40:15 <o9l[m]> ah thats ok, all my contacts are on my iphone anyways
22:40:22 <tidria[m]> Ya was going to chime in with that, export the vcf and it makes that easy at least
22:41:44 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: those polarized privacy screens to guard against shoulder surfing sound pretty neat! I should consider getting one, possibly!
22:42:08 <o9l[m]> yeah it got it off amazon for a fiver, super nice
22:42:13 <TheJollyRoger> Beautiful!
22:42:25 <o9l[m]> darkens your screen a tiny bit but i think its hardly noticable
22:43:46 <TheJollyRoger> freeasfreedom69: with respect to smartphone cases that cover cameras for the Pixel, I don't think I know of any offhand, but an easy and low cost solution is to use a piece of electrical tape, and then replace the tape whenever the glue loses its tackiness.
22:44:51 <tidria[m]> dbrand actually has a cool looking "teardown" one
22:45:05 <tidria[m]> just a vinyl though, not a case
22:45:06 <o9l[m]> guess i'll install some apps whilst i wait. who/what should i wait on for assisstance?
22:45:40 <TheJollyRoger> Electrical tape (at least high quality electrical tape) should leave less residue than duct tape. Please don't use solvents like Goo-B-Gone, that can attack the glues holding your phone together.
22:46:01 <TheJollyRoger> o9l[m]: I'm not sure yet, sorry.
22:46:28 <o9l[m]> that's cool
22:46:36 <o9l[m]> i can handle google for a day or two
23:07:49 <o9l[m]> should i try and just boot ubuntu on my spare pc and see if that works? i feel its a manjaro thing not a phone thing
23:12:37 <tidria[m]> worth a shot if it isn't putting you out to do so
23:12:50 <o9l[m]> nope, spare mac mini with nothing on it
23:12:53 <o9l[m]> not mac os so
23:13:04 <o9l[m]> might as well just boot ubuntu and give it a go
23:13:15 <o9l[m]> probably tomorrow though
23:43:30 <whhoops[m]> I need help
23:43:48 <whhoops[m]> Powershell won't enable fastboot unlock
23:44:10 <whhoops[m]> It doesn't dtect the phone.......
23:55:27 <whhoops[m]> Anyone?
23:56:06 <whhoops[m]> I tried to update device drivers
23:56:43 <whhoops[m]> Am at the waiting for any device section
23:57:48 <rny> wow nice, web-usb merged
23:59:32 <Kribbles> I don't know if my previous message sent or not, internet died while sending it. If not, I was following the grapheneos installation process, thought I installed the OS properly, locked fastboot, booted the system and I have no OS. Is there a way to unbrick my phone?
