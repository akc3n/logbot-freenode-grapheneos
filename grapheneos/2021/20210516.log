00:00:19 <applejuice543[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg:
00:00:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> are you doing it locally?
00:00:27 <applejuice543[m]> yes
00:00:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no internet is required in this case
00:00:46 <applejuice543[m]> what do umean loccaly?
00:01:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://attestation.app/tutorial
00:01:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Local verification vs Scheduled remote verification
00:05:28 <applejuice543[m]> the audtiro app is not going well
00:05:31 <applejuice543[m]> i needf some halp
00:05:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sup
00:05:43 <applejuice543[m]> ight
00:05:46 <applejuice543[m]> so
00:05:53 <applejuice543[m]> i am trying to pair them
00:06:05 <applejuice543[m]> and it says error enocunted generating attensation
00:06:13 <applejuice543[m]> challegne message not expected size
00:06:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which phone says that?
00:06:37 <applejuice543[m]> another android phone
00:06:43 <applejuice543[m]> as the s10 was not supported
00:07:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is it supported, your other phone?
00:07:46 <applejuice543[m]> yes
00:08:00 <applejuice543[m]> should i clear both of there stuff etc
00:08:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, so you installed Auditor from Google Play
00:08:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> correct?
00:08:35 <applejuice543[m]> yes
00:08:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> good
00:09:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which one of them was Auditor and which one of them was Auditee?
00:09:42 <applejuice543[m]> the graphene one had the error
00:09:45 <applejuice543[m]> the other phone was stock
00:10:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> apple, which one of them was Auditor and which one of them was Auditee?
00:10:36 <applejuice543[m]> graphene is audittee i think
00:10:37 <applejuice543[m]> and stock is
00:10:39 <applejuice543[m]> audtior
00:10:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> correct
00:11:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, clear the data they created already
00:11:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and start over
00:11:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> stock = AuditorGrapheneOS = Auditee
00:12:27 <applejuice543[m]> done
00:12:28 <applejuice543[m]> both cleared
00:13:58 <applejuice543[m]> nvmbro
00:14:07 <applejuice543[m]> thanks for help
00:14:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> did auditing go well?
00:16:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if it didn't go well, try remote verification
00:19:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> anyway, i'm out
00:20:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> welcome aboard apple!
00:21:02 <returnnullptr[m]> im new to this matrix shit. but this is really fucking cool. nice convo :)
00:23:10 <akc3n[m]> returnnullptr: check out #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org too
00:34:07 <vdh7[m]> when I check exodus there plenty of permissions that seem granted to apps that we don't really have control in the system settings. Does this means that there is no where to turn that off?
00:35:25 <dazinism> vdh7: they are install time permissions. Their names can be a bit confusing, they don't always do what you would imagine
00:35:58 <dazinism> You can't deny them, they are more for auditing an app
00:36:30 <dazinism> If you have a proper understanding of what they mean
00:47:12 <dazinism> vdh7: This paper gives a good overview of how the security works on android
00:47:16 <dazinism> https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05572
00:47:41 <dazinism> Page 7 has details about different types of permiasions
00:51:16 <dazinism> vdh7: theres some advice about things to look out for when installing apps here
00:51:23 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
00:51:54 <vdh7[m]> dazinism: thank you very much for the resources
00:52:19 <dazinism> No problem
01:02:30 <Adam217> hi
01:03:26 <Adam217> my non graphene os phone
01:03:34 <Adam217> can receive text messages while on airplane mode
01:03:39 <Adam217> Im worried my airplane mode doesnt work
01:05:42 <dazinism> On wifi?
01:06:19 <Adam217> no
01:06:28 <Adam217> Just airplane mode, wifi off
01:06:39 <Adam217> I can still get text message and voicemail notificiations in real time
01:06:42 <Adam217> WIFI calling is off
01:06:58 <dazinism> That shouldn't happen.
01:07:28 <vdh7[m]> dazinism: So Exodus shows the full lists of permissions required by the app, but it's not possible to know at that level of detail which ones are actually denied and authorized after I tweaked the in system settings? I guess we can only guess at the high level ?
01:07:50 <Adam217> normally you can see exact permissions on each app
01:07:55 <Adam217> microphone, camera etc per app
01:08:50 <dazinism> Yeah, for user facing (also known as 'dangerous')permissions thats the case
01:09:17 <dazinism> Aka runtime permissions
01:10:08 <dazinism> Others are automatically 'granted' when you inatall
01:10:19 <dazinism> Install an app
01:10:36 <felipe_cl> Hey guys, I'm starting with grapheneos, reading and learning. Do you have some lecture or tutorials recommendaded ??
01:11:18 <dazinism> felipe_cl: see the links i posted above. Also read all the GrapheneOS site
01:11:44 <felipe_cl> thank you!!!
01:11:49 <vdh7[m]> <Adam217 "normally you can see exact permi"> yeah but I meant knowing at a deeper level like I see for example that my Mi Fit app has FLASHLIGHT under the CAMERA permission like WTF?
01:14:04 <Adam217> Just dont install any apps
01:14:14 <Adam217> except for like  , VPN, Signal messenger, f droid etc
01:16:41 <vdh7[m]> yeah well I'm just at the start of my journey towards privacy, I'm only starting to realize the shit that has been going with apps >.<
01:18:22 <AndrsBS[m]> Good morning/night folks, I got a question:
01:18:23 <AndrsBS[m]> If I disable OEM unlocking, will I still be able to re-flash any system image as long as it is signed under the same key?
01:18:38 <AndrsBS[m]> I didn't want to disable it in case I got soft-bricked
01:20:30 <AndrsBS[m]> (*flash from fastboot)
01:21:03 <dazinism> Andrés B.S.: i think you need it OEM unlocked, but i could be confused
01:21:28 <AndrsBS[m]> strictly needed, not
01:21:28 <AndrsBS[m]> but it does enhance seurity
01:22:05 <AndrsBS[m]> ahhh I thought you meant I needed it on to be able to run at all, my bad :')
01:24:37 <vdh7[m]> if I want to like to go private. Do I have to new make accounts for all websites/apps account at the same time? While switching to new hardware and phone number? I'm thinking that if like I change only some of the things, there will always be so identifier tying to me?
01:25:48 <AndrsBS[m]> So so
01:26:04 <vdh7[m]> like do we need to do a complete reset or is it enough to just change a few things there and there
02:01:20 <AndrsBS[m]> on Graphene OS, not really, on others, yes
02:01:42 <AndrsBS[m]> I meant, on Graphene OS you don't need to
02:02:32 <AndrsBS[m]> I suggest you take a look around the [feature list](https://grapheneos.org/features) and the [FAQ](https://grapheneos.org/faq)
02:05:11 <M7777777y[m]> vdh7: You should start by doing a bunch of research
02:05:46 <M7777777y[m]> Consider the surface level of things and also the technical backend of these
02:05:56 <M7777777y[m]> There are certain things that are going to be tied together
02:06:18 <M7777777y[m]> If facebook has determined what your youtube account is
02:06:37 <M7777777y[m]> And also your twitter
02:06:40 <M7777777y[m]> Or whatever else things you have
02:06:45 <M7777777y[m]> And you get rid of most
02:06:47 <M7777777y[m]> And then keep one
02:07:05 <M7777777y[m]> And then that one gets linked to others somehow, you could leave a trail.
02:07:12 <M7777777y[m]>  * And then that one gets linked to new ones somehow, you could leave a trail.
02:07:28 <M7777777y[m]> You should start with compartmentalizing the old ones and separating them from the new ones
02:07:54 <M7777777y[m]> You don't have to do them all at once, do them gradually but keep them completely separate until you're done
02:32:54 <ramenweekend[m]> <dazinism "ramenweekend: some carriers bloc"> dazinism: I was reading this:

02:35:44 <vdh7[m]> <ramenweekend[m] "Pixel 6 😂 hoping for an I/O ann"> isn't the next google conf about announcing 5a only?
02:36:31 <ramenweekend[m]> We'll see on Tuesday.

02:36:51 <thegleefultroll[> Pixel 6 already???
02:36:52 <thegleefultroll[> damn
02:37:46 <ramenweekend[m]> I'm confused strcat.
02:38:04 <M7777777y[m]> Hopefully the old pixels don't go out of production yet
02:38:12 <M7777777y[m]> Because the new ones are probably going to be less good
02:38:42 <vdh7[m]> <AndrsBS[m] "I suggest you take a look around"> I bought a pixel 4a this week and started by installing calyxos. I'm considering trying grapheneos next before settling
02:39:42 <ramenweekend[m]> I would guess the 3XL would be next on the chopping block to be dropped.
02:44:56 <strcat> AndrsBS[m]: it's not clear what you're concerned about
02:45:09 <strcat> AndrsBS[m]: you should have the OEM unlocking toggle disabled
02:45:11 <strcat> there is no risk in that
02:45:45 <strcat> I think you're misunderstanding what it does because you can still sideload properly signed update packages (with the usual signature and downgrade protection) and can still wipe data via recovery
02:47:54 <strcat> vdh7[m]: please stick to discussing GrapheneOS here
02:49:17 <vdh7[m]> ah sorry for mentioning another os
02:49:18 <strcat[m]> vdh7: low-level permissions do not have a privacy or security purpose
02:49:19 <strcat[m]> vdh7: only permissions marked dangerous do
02:49:31 <strcat[m]> vdh7: mentioning another OS is generally fine but you're promoting a malicious project here
02:49:53 <strcat[m]> you're promoting a project which has been actively engaged in causing harm to us in underhanded ways
02:50:01 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure why you're bringing that up here
02:50:12 <strcat[m]> you're also spreading misinformation about low-level permissions
02:51:17 <strcat[m]> I suggest not using broken / inaccurate third party 'privacy' and 'security' apps
02:52:14 <strcat[m]> in general, they aren't useful, they live in the app sandbox and can't really do much of any use beyond looking at the code in other apks statically and making inaccurate guesses about what's used and what it does
02:52:59 <strcat[m]> a library being included in an app for crash reporting via a third party service, etc. does not imply any privacy issues or that it's even used by default without opt-in
02:53:26 <strcat[m]> low-level permission model does not offer privacy/security features accomplishing anything
02:53:32 <strcat[m]>  * low-level permission model also does not offer privacy/security features accomplishing anything
02:53:40 <strcat[m]> they aren't displayed in the normal UI because they aren't meaningful
02:54:12 <strcat[m]> they are grouped into meaningful permissions and toggles, not all in the permission menu, such as the toggle for restricting the ability for apps to run in the background to reduce battery usage
02:54:37 <strcat[m]> many of them simply provide the ability to request something from the user
02:54:45 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding what they are
02:54:55 <strcat[m]> and you're demonstrating why the app you're using is inaccurate, poorly made and actively harmful
02:55:17 <strcat[m]> because it gives highly misleading information and doesn't try to explain it, and actively engages in misleading people to make them concerned
02:55:32 <ramenweekend[m]> Was I not referring to APN problems and linking to a closed issue tracker?
02:55:37 <strcat[m]> both about permissions and about libraries that are used
02:56:11 <strcat[m]> ramenweekend: you were referring to making derivatives of GrapheneOS which is outside the scope of the channel
02:56:19 <strcat[m]> ramenweekend: it has nothing to do with GrapheneOS
02:56:23 <strcat[m]> or the issue you linked
02:56:51 <strcat[m]> derivatives of GrapheneOS should be discussed in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
02:57:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> thegleefultroll: nice name
02:57:07 <ramenweekend[m]> Is that not the right github issue tracker? I've been reading the wrong project?
02:58:30 <M7777777y[m]> I seen some of those attacks against graphene and strcat but when I come and look more into this project myself it seems to be the most dedicated one by far and I can respect that, all the hostility does not make sense to me
02:59:45 <strcat[m]> ramenweekend: no, that's not what I'm saying
02:59:58 <M7777777y[m]> Some people get so sensitive when they're told to "go read the manual" or something haha when it is usually the best thing to do
03:00:24 <ramenweekend[m]> That's not even remotely what I'm saying. I will read it. I just need to know I'm reading the right one.
03:00:37 <strcat[m]> ramenweekend: the channel is about GrapheneOS and that includes people talking about contributing to GrapheneOS / working on it
03:00:49 <strcat[m]> ramenweekend: but does not include people getting help for their forks or discussing them
03:00:57 <strcat[m]> unless the intention is to land their changes upstream
03:01:14 <ramenweekend[m]> But I'm having an APN problem with the OS. Is that considered off-topic?
03:01:55 <strcat[m]> ramenweekend: it's on-topic if you stick to discussing it in the context of GrapheneOS which could mean contributing a patch rather than talking about making a fork of GrapheneOS
03:02:16 <strcat[m]> a fork/derivative of GrapheneOS is not on-topic here
03:02:36 <ramenweekend[m]> I was not wanting to fork it. I just been reading issues from the github channel.
03:03:34 <ramenweekend[m]>  * I was not wanting to fork it. I just been reading issues from the github channel. Not sure if I can contribute a patch in any way. Which might be the wrong github page.
03:03:40 <thegleefultroll[> <M7777777y[m] "I seen some of those attacks aga"> long history of heated disagreements between communities
03:03:58 <strcat[m]> none of this involves a heated disagreement

03:07:39 <thegleefultroll[> ok, thanks for info.
03:17:41 <strcat[m]> received information from someone about thegleefultroll being involved in a community focused on attacking GrapheneOS and it appears that's what they were here to do particularly if they're going to confirm it like that

03:46:18 <ineedhelp> o/. I'm trying to install grapheneOS on my pixel 4a and I'm running into some issues, would anyone be able to help? I keep getting that my fastboot is too old despite being the latest version when I try to flash the OS. Thanks
04:00:03 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <ineedhelp "o/. I'm trying to install graphe"> Apt name
04:00:25 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But to the point
04:00:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You should use the web installer, it's far easier
04:02:39 <strcat[m]> ineedhelp: you probably aren't using the official guide and you're using an older version without realizing it
04:02:49 <strcat[m]> please use https://grapheneos.org/install/web (recommended) or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
04:03:02 <strcat[m]> remove anything you installed / downloaded based on unofficial guides, particularly inaccurate videos from YouTube
04:07:20 <ineedhelp> thanks! I went ahead and just manually used the commands I saw in the .bat file and I have everything up and running. I'll keep this in mind. I was going off the newest install page that you linked.
04:07:33 <ineedhelp> Railgun_Lover[m] thanks :)
04:14:07 <strcat[m]> ineedhelp: you're not done if you didn't lock
04:14:26 <strcat[m]> ineedhelp: it sounds like you didn't set the `PATH` variable and therefore the script was unable to find the correct fastboot
04:14:32 <strcat[m]> and you have another older legacy fastboot installed that is in PATH
04:14:36 <strcat[m]> you missed the PATH step
04:15:28 <strcat[m]> i.e. you have some outdated fastboot installed perhaps via some messed up third party installer, and that is in PATH (i.e. if you open a fresh terminal and run `fastboot --version` it is presumably there)
04:15:51 <strcat[m]> and you didn't set PATH properly to point at the up-to-date fastboot
04:16:05 <strcat[m]> you were perhaps using some incorrect unofficial approach / workaround
04:16:21 <strcat[m]> can't see what you were doing so don't know for sure but not setting PATH is a common mistake
04:16:41 <strcat[m]> including closing the terminal, opening a new one, and not setting PATH again
04:17:21 <strcat[m]> particularly by opening a new terminal with a different working directory rather than one in the default directory as the instructions say
04:43:50 <ineedhelp> strcat[m] yep! you're right, I guess it wasn't setup correctly since opening a terminal and checking the version nets an error/ no fastboot. Also, I did make sure to lock and finish up, but thanks for checking in on that!

11:45:01 <fomijafi[m]> Whereas on stock I believe play services assists in getting location
11:50:05 <strcat[m]> GPS doesn't take that long if you're actually outside + connected to cellular network
11:50:09 <strcat[m]> since it uses A-GPS via cellular
11:50:28 <strcat[m]> it takes a while if you aren't connected to cellular since then it only has GPS almanacs via network
12:03:03 <fomijafi[m]> Thanks. I've read you talking about this before but I was too lazy to look up the full explanation
12:14:54 <safetyissues[m]> Good day. Can someone ELI5 what exact risks I have if I use the owner profile for my sensitive chats on any messenger app?
12:22:15 <helloworldkk87[m> The point of using secondary profiles is the ability to put them at rest when not in use. Not really a risk to use owner profile for daily usage. If that is what you were asking
12:32:34 <somenerd[m]> > The point of using secondary profiles is the ability to put them at rest when not in use. Not really a risk to use owner profile for daily usage. If that is what you were asking
12:32:34 <somenerd[m]> also to have seperate workspaces
12:33:07 <somenerd[m]> (for example, if you don't want an app to access contacts, you can keep it in another profile and give contacts access there)
12:33:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Mostly on secondary users it's a relatively lower risk, as the encryption keys are per profile, which flushed when logged out (secondary users) or rebooted (owner user), and owner profile is always running when the OS is booted
12:34:52 <somenerd[m]> also, the app can't communicate across the profiles with other apps
12:36:56 <hitchhooker[m]> gos still possible to install on pixel3?
12:37:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <hitchhooker[m] "gos still possible to install on"> Yes
12:37:50 <somenerd[m]> I believe so

13:04:44 <strcat1> MrSenshi[m]: what do you mean?

14:20:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Wilm> Hi,does grapheneOS remove the Google Firmware from the Pixel phone before installing? My worries are that there maybe is some Google tracking code embedded? Or does graphene block the Firmware somehow?Cheers
14:21:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!.> https://grapheneos.org/faq#google-services
14:23:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Wilm> Thx, but i dont mean the play service. I was thinking about the phone calling home before graphene is startend. Maybe some code running directly on the chips.
14:28:54 <KennyWalther[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Wilm> Thx, but i dont mean the"> that is something that i'm aware too
14:33:54 <dazinism> Wilm: theoretically its possible, but its unlikely and as far as I'm aware hasn't been recorded.
14:34:23 <dazinism> Theres various ways of looking at what network connections a device is making
14:35:19 <dazinism> Lots of other things are theoretically possible, also unlikely.
14:39:26 <dazinism> Its pretty much impossible to get a modern computing device in which you don't have to have to trust a whole load of organisations
14:40:48 <dazinism> The cost to these organisations, if they are found to break that trust, acts to reduce the chance they will do so.
14:48:28 <southron[m]> I think the GOS setup is about as secure and private as you could reasonably expect. If I was concerned about some sort of backdoor I'd be using burner phones only.
14:48:59 <dazinism> Most Pixel phones operate with full Android and generally collect a whole load of data from their users. This is documented and users grant permission -although probably often don't read the small print
14:49:57 <dazinism> Them adding undocumented covert data collection would be an ** interesting ** business move
15:07:14 <hyper_reality[m]> I'd just like to give some praise for the graphene web installer. It was incredibly smooth and easy, great job.
15:12:57 <lasseter[m]> GOS user here on a Pixel 4a looking to migrate to a Pixel 5.  Is there a procedure to do so or will I have to set everything up by scratch again?
15:14:29 <dazinism> lasseter:  its possible to backup most things
15:14:32 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups#Backup_secondary_user_and_work_profiles
15:15:02 <nfp[m]> How long will the Pixel 3 be supported again?
15:15:38 <dazinism> Think its - at least till October
15:16:19 <dazinism> Likely to get a bit longer from Google
15:18:00 <dazinism> Also may get 'obsolete' releases from GrapheneOS for some months after that
15:18:55 <dazinism> Pixel 2 ended guaranteed support last October and still gets 'obsolete' GrapheneOS updates
15:20:39 <dazinism> There aren't full security updates and its recommended to move to a device with full support.
16:03:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Hello, sorry for bringing up an old discussion, I was interested in buying a yubikey, but I read that on android the FIDO2 passwordless login won't work without play services, so I was reading those messages and thinking, if the yubikey is supported, but FIDO2 is not, what else can you use it for? I guess TOTP still works using yubikey on grapheneOS? Are there other use cases?
16:14:33 <lackshan[m]> You can use it for OTP and Challenge response
16:15:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Thanks, so even without playservices those 2 works
16:15:02 <lackshan[m]> Challenge response will require the ykdroid app
16:15:18 <lackshan[m]> Yep but very few apps actually support challenge response
16:15:30 <lackshan[m]> So realistically only otp
16:15:41 <lackshan[m]> But keepassdx may add it in V3
16:15:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T​heOnlyRealJonathan> Ok thanks mate
16:17:49 <MrSenshi[m]> <strcat1 "the safe audio hard limit is alr"> Odd, I have an Apple USBC to Headjack dongle and everything is quiet coming through it... Except for on PC.
16:27:26 <covid-1984[m]> Any idea why I can't call or receive calls? I do have a SIP account... I should try deleting it I guess. But even checking the balance via *111# says "connection problem or invalid MMI code"
16:35:04 <covid-1984[m]> Wow... Fixed it
16:35:11 <covid-1984[m]> The only thing I could think of was network setting
16:35:11 * MrSenshi[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LgEtRwhuKRCKPOjIbmQFnKDj/message.txt >
16:35:54 <covid-1984[m]> So in my case I couldn't receive or make any calls... or send SMS codes. Now that I turn of "LTE only" (changed to LTE recommended) - it works
16:36:08 <covid-1984[m]> I just didn't notice for weeks cuz I don't often receive or make calls
17:01:31 <strcat[m]> MrSenshi: as I said we already disable safe volume
17:02:06 <MrSenshi[m]> Right, thanks.
17:29:40 <applejuice543[m]> i have a question
17:29:42 <applejuice543[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg: hey teleg
17:30:19 <strcat> covid-1984[m]: LTE and beyond only support calls via data (SIP via IMS)
17:30:29 <strcat> covid-1984[m]: so, sounds like your carrier doesn't support that
17:30:40 <strcat> requiring it to drop to 2G/3G for calls
17:31:34 <applejuice543[m]> hey strcat
17:31:43 <applejuice543[m]> can you but paretnal controls on graphene os
17:31:56 <applejuice543[m]> if so are there any open source parental control apps out there?
17:32:05 <applejuice543[m]>  * if noy are there any open source parental control apps out there?
17:32:09 <applejuice543[m]>  * if not are there any open source parental control apps out there?
17:36:35 <strcat[m]> you'll need to clarify exactly what you mean
17:36:51 <strcat[m]> you want to make them a restricted user profile or restrict the device as a whole?
17:36:54 <surveillexxxx[m]> <applejuice543[m] "if so are there any open source "> you can install malware on the phone
17:36:58 <strcat[m]> either way you can use a device manager
17:37:44 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <applejuice543[m] "GrapheneOS-Teleg: hey teleg"> Lol
17:41:40 <lackshan[m]> Can anyone point me to a guide explaining how to create a system app for aosp with the new Soong build system?
17:42:12 <lackshan[m]> I'm having trouble including the material design library
17:45:44 <strcat> lackshan[m]: look at Updater
17:47:58 <lackshan[m]> strcat Will do. Thanks!
18:12:35 <yodawins[m]> akc3n:  Regarding the wiki: I cant find it on grapheneos.org
18:16:54 <yodawins[m]> Also, duckduckgo let me down :p
18:17:35 <akc3n[m]> <yodawins[m] "akc3n:  Regarding the wiki: I ca"> dazinism is the maintainer of the https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home iirc and it is a community wiki.
18:22:12 <yodawins[m]> Okay, then I got you wrong, tougth you said it was listed @ faq/source, my bad.
19:11:47 <yodawins[m]> "Printing services" should it be on/off default in Graphene? What do you think?
19:25:53 <akc3n[m]> <yodawins[m] ""Printing services" should it be"> Personally, I would not recommend messing with the system services. I've seen so many people over time here change up system services and then forget what they did, and some stuff just stops working. Then they want everyone to figure it out for them
19:37:36 <yodawins[m]> Okay, I see
20:06:24 <DemiMarie> What is the status of the app repository?
20:18:31 <akc3n[m]> Hi Demi Obenour 👋 check out https://mobile.twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1393820238601494528
20:19:45 <akc3n[m]> I know I didn't really answer your question. But just a reference side note.
20:25:49 <yodawins[m]> Maybe a stupied question, but what does the dot/circle in status bar mean?
20:33:27 <akc3n[m]> <yodawins[m] "Maybe a stupied question, but wh"> Notification Dot
20:34:46 <akc3n[m]> It means you have more notifications icons in overflow
20:35:46 <yodawins[m]> Ah, thank you.

22:54:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Moctezuma (@M​0ctezuma) has joined the Telegram Group!
22:55:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Hello 😇
22:55:47 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<M0ctezuma> Hello 😇"> Heaveno
22:55:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hi!GrapheneOS Official Channel | Log https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos | Rules https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt | Related Channels: @grapheneosofftopic
22:57:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Last week i read about conversations.im is storing plaintext logs in an unencrypted database... is this an issue in grapheneos, too?
22:57:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this is completely unrelated to GrapheneOS
22:58:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Ok, because...m
22:58:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS does not make insecure communications secure
22:58:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's all up to app developers
22:59:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS only makes sure that the app won't break/infiltrate/crack/hack/... your system
23:00:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is Android Hardening Project
23:01:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> NOT Android-Fix-All-Apps-Project
23:01:57 <vdh7[m]> is it normal to get a message that f droid was developed for an older version of android when installing f droid?
23:02:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i recommend you to use Aurora Store for most apps
23:03:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and maybe Foxy Droid if you really need it
23:04:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (note that i am not a dev, nor mod)
23:05:24 <vdh7[m]> but looks like foxy droid only bring some cosmetic changes compared to f droid?
23:05:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Yeah but my question is, if i have conversations app installed, like its recommended by many privacy focused blogs etc, then an attacker will be able to get all my (even deleted) messages from the unencrypted sql db sitting in data/data/eu.siacs.conversations/history
23:06:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read the faq on encryption
23:07:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> I read aurora is more likely to have malwared apps because its a shady appstore??
23:07:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should def check your sources
23:08:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or you're misrepresenting Aurora Store with a different product that has a name Aurora in it
23:09:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Aurora Store is basically a Google Play Store frontend, which does not require google play services to be present unlike the original Play Store
23:13:15 <vdh7[m]> why does vanadium always have a dot on the icon?
23:14:35 <vdh7[m]> makes me think that I have something to check ? >.<
23:14:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> means you've got a notification
23:15:08 <vdh7[m]> oh right thx
23:15:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Yeah sorry for that. But with aurora there are legality issues.
23:16:35 <vdh7[m]> what issues?
23:16:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> btw, sorry that i didn't understood your first question initially
23:16:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> F-Droid: Freie und quelloffene Apps – Take back control! Teil5 ⋆ Kuketz IT-Security Bloghttps://www.kuketz-blog.de/f-droid-freie-und-quelloffene-apps-take-back-control-teil5/
23:17:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> At the end
23:17:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Kuketz writes about legality issues with aurora. Maybe its only für germany
23:17:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i thought you meant unencrypted database on a distant server
23:18:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Nono it is stored directly on the phone
23:18:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, i realized that only later on
23:18:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Local, In the apps folder in data/data/eu.siacs.conversations/history
23:19:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> And so does xabber
23:19:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Too
23:19:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is encrypted with file-based-encryption
23:19:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Yeah
23:19:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> by the system
23:19:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> doesn't matter if it's GrapheneOS tho, stock does the same encryption by default
23:19:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> M​0ctezuma shared a file (application/pdf) on Telegram with title: 'One_key_to_rule_them_all_Recovering_the_maste_2021_Forensic_Science.pdf'.
23:20:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> 😅
23:21:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> interesting🧐
23:22:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> I hate all those publications claiming to test modern phones and then you read "we use android 4" or as in this case, pixel xl. Are u fkn kidding me?
23:23:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> So tomorrow i will set their toollkit up and tamper with my pixel 3 xl
23:24:34 <vdh7[m]> but your blogger doesn't elaborate
23:25:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> lol, they did use Nexus 5X and Pixel XL
23:25:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Bro this was published in science direct journal
23:25:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> "proof of concept" kinda research
23:25:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in 2021
23:25:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Yeah last month
23:26:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> we should probably move to off-topic tho
23:26:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> All these publications in this topic are, arent they?
23:26:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> they are only implicitly GrapheneOS related
23:27:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> not explicitly
23:27:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <M​0ctezuma> Or do you know some other sources for explicit pixel or graphene testing / research?
23:27:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, i guess so, i haven't read many
