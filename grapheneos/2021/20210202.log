00:57:52 <mishmasher[m]> Is there a reason why I can't install keepassdx on a secondary profile? I have it on the owner profile too, might this be the problem?
00:58:33 <mishmasher[m]> I have also updated to latest version
02:23:10 <jjjhhhkkklll> jjjhhhkkklll: hi
02:46:48 <deappledapple> <mishmasher[m] "Is there a reason why I can't in"> Github version and Play store version have different signature
03:01:57 <mishmasher[m]> <deappledapple "Github version and Play store ve"> I only use F-droid but, I think it the problem is with the download not the installation.
03:05:00 <b1101> deappledapple: what app are you talking about?
03:07:30 <b1101> My vpn provider provides a better apk directly and/or through fdroid than they do on the playstore, as it has an antitracker feature; which if it was included on the playstore, would probably be taken down
03:09:29 <pnrxa[m]> Sounds like PIA or at least they do that too
03:11:43 <b1101> pnrxa: no. ivpn. left pia late last year. they got bought by a sketchy company
03:11:52 <b1101> pnrxa[m]: ^
03:12:21 <pnrxa[m]> b1101: I've been meaning to but waiting until 3 year membership expires
03:12:58 <b1101> also wireguard :D
03:13:50 <pnrxa[m]> Wireguard is amazing
03:14:03 <mishmasher[m]> Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?: aah I figured it out had to delete cache of F-droid and updated repos. Works like a charm now thanks
03:29:40 <zzxx1236> Does GrapheneOS kernel have the wireguard module?
03:33:55 <zzxx1236> Ok just read a news Google will include wireguard in A12 kernel
03:38:29 <zzxx1236> can we currently load a dkms module ?
03:38:55 <rny> no
04:00:24 <jb76> Hey everyone. I am installing Graphene for the first time. Having an issue where the flash-all.bat doesnt work for me. Says im using a old fastboot.
04:00:44 <jb76> check version and it shows current/correct version.
04:01:34 <jb76> I did have about 4 other fastboot files from different times that I went back and removed.
04:03:40 <jb76> fastboot : The term 'fastboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
04:03:41 <jb76> Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

04:05:12 <jb76> Its a pixel 4xl, installing on windows 10
04:09:33 <strcat> sounds like you aren't following the official instructions
04:10:01 <strcat> jb76: either use the installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web or the official CLI instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
04:10:05 <strcat> don't use unofficial guides
04:10:38 <strcat> zzxx1236: having the kernel module doesn't accomplish anything without userspace integration
04:10:42 <somenerd[m]> would the web install be the first recommendation?
04:11:01 <strcat> somenerd[m]: yes, for users not on an OS with working fastboot/signify packages at least
04:11:37 <somenerd[m]> also, if https is mitmed, wouldn't they change the PGP key as well?
04:14:26 <strcat[m]> somenerd: there's no PGP key + don't really know what you mean
04:14:38 <somenerd[m]> oh wait it isn't PGP
04:14:45 <somenerd[m]> the key used for verification
04:14:59 <somenerd[m]> normally this is used to verify beyond the security of https
04:15:02 <strcat[m]> read what it says at https://grapheneos.org/install/ and https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
04:20:38 <jb76> Alright, I am using the web installer. I was hoping to get some ideas into fixing the problem. I dont really learn anything by clicking a button.
04:25:33 <strcat> jb76: the install guide is not really intending to teach people how to do stuff but rather have them copy the instructions precisely and adjust device name to the one they have
04:28:51 <strcat> if you're familiar with CLI stuff it makes sense though
04:31:02 <jb76> @strcat I m not. Just started getting into the phone stuff a few months ago. Shame, I couldn't even make the copy and paste stuff work. I guess I should be happy there is a web install
04:32:55 <TheLoneWanderer[> You probably forgot the "Add to path" step
04:33:36 <strcat[m]> jb76: maybe issue is you closed it and reopened it
04:33:42 <strcat[m]> jb76: so you lost the path configuration
04:33:54 <strcat[m]> jb76: it's just easier to tell people to use the web installer now
04:34:45 <jb76> It clearly is. Its done already and I am looking at the os now.
04:36:28 <take_a_deep_brea> very nice !
04:37:48 <jb76> Kind of fun to see the google logo get taken over by the graphene logo.
04:40:53 <take_a_deep_brea> yes .
04:42:56 <jb76> Sweet. I am glad I purchased the pixel for this. I was happy with the e.foundation stuff on a op6t but had to try this.
04:44:22 <b1101> I switched from google fi to tmobile to use graphene without issue
04:46:44 <bn365[m]> hello, someone has solve <Waiting for any device> error during flash of install? final ask for help from maybe a project developper, I cannot do more troubleshooting anymore. unlocked Pixel 4a. I have tried this: ASUS Ubuntu 20.04, macAir catalina OS, HP Win10. i have follow CLI exact ver batim many times, doing web install as well. i try OEM USB A-C cable, and i purchase INSIGNIA USB A-C cable also. i have tried to
04:46:44 <bn365[m]> install the Arch Linux but it is too advanced. i have done factory reset of phone and start it over. nothing is working, same error always during flash command <Waiting for any device>. so far 2.5 weeks to troubleshoot, 500$ cost so far.
04:47:23 <strcat> bn365[m]: sounds like a USB issue
04:47:51 <bn365[m]> <strcat "bn365: sounds like a USB issue"> 2 different usb cable, 3 different computer
04:47:57 <strcat> bn365[m]: do it on the macbook air with web installer and the USB-C cable that comes with it
04:48:01 <strcat> the one that comes with the phone
04:48:19 <strcat> bn365[m]: so probably both those USB-A to USB-C cables are bad
04:48:30 <bn365[m]> i have purchase a second usb from bestbuy which also did not work
04:48:42 <strcat> use the one that comes with the phone
04:48:52 <strcat> purchasing a new cable somewhere doesn't guarantee you get a working USB cable
04:49:00 <strcat> most USB-A to USB-C cables are not to spec and are broken
04:49:18 <strcat> bn365[m]: the phone is booted into the bootloader menu, right?
04:49:21 <bn365[m]> i have tried oem and aftermarket cables. the aftermarket is rated 'data transfer'
04:49:30 <bn365[m]> bootloader screen always
04:49:51 <strcat> bn365[m]: does your macbook have a USB-C port? use that with the cable that comes with the phone
04:49:54 <strcat> and web installer so it's easy
04:50:12 <jb76> web installer is easy
04:50:45 <bn365[m]> i do not have access to macair. i had borrow from a friend. i tried both cable, the web install, the CLI when i had borrowed. always stops on FASTBOOTD screen of 4 option. web installer stuck at 'restarting device'
04:51:10 <TheLoneWanderer[> I'm quite amazed at the web install. I wasn't expecting anything like it
04:52:11 <strcat[m]> The Lone Wanderer: was my plan for a long time, didn't have any interest in having people download some OS specific executable mess because this makes more sense
04:52:40 <take_a_deep_brea> true .
04:55:05 <jb76> Whats a good irc client app  to use?
04:59:08 <bn365[m]> thank you to all who have help to troubleshoot. no bad feeling, i appreciate. 500$ dollar waste ☹️ follow every guidance i receive, nothing is work. good luck other person hope you have success
05:12:20 <TheLoneWanderer[> Have you tried the CLI method?
05:17:42 <jb76> Just donated.. Thanks for the help..
05:19:02 <take_a_deep_brea> great !
05:19:33 <strcat> bn365[m]: I think you need to try the web installer with the USB-C cable that comes with the device - your other cables are very likely not working ones
05:19:46 <strcat> bn365[m]: or buy a proper USB-A to USB-C cable from Anker or whatever
05:22:53 <strcat> more time than usual for today's update since we also need a Vanadium rebase onto the latest Chromium stable release
05:34:00 <Lithuania2478845> Hello, fellow graphene os peoples
05:34:11 <rny> hi
05:34:38 <Lithuania2478845> My CIA handler is requesting a built in voice changer
05:34:45 <Lithuania2478845> To be added to graphene
05:34:57 <Lithuania2478845> Just a simple pitch modulator
05:35:10 <strcat[m]> Lithuania2478845: no
05:35:16 <strcat[m]> Lithuania2478845: no more of that please
05:35:16 <Lithuania2478845> Raise pitch, apply filter to voice data before sending over airwaves
05:35:28 <strcat> use end to end encrypted calls
05:35:33 <Lithuania2478845> It seems extremely easy to impliment
05:35:42 <Lithuania2478845> Just a pitch modulation
05:35:50 <somenerd[m]> but it's not wanted
05:35:50 <strcat> not useful
05:35:55 <strcat> we don't do security theater
05:36:06 <strcat> use end to end encrypted calls
05:36:38 <Lithuania2478845> Changing the voice pitch allows ones voice to mismatch/evade "Voice Print Analysis".
05:36:48 <strcat> no
05:36:51 <strcat> not interested
05:36:56 <strcat> please, don't have time for this anymore
05:37:09 <Lithuania2478845> Yes, at a technological level thats how it would work.
05:37:20 <somenerd[m]> look
05:37:22 <Lithuania2478845> It would take like 1 day
05:37:36 <rny> LOL
05:37:43 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS is NOT INTERESTED
05:37:44 <Lithuania2478845> Its just a pitch modulation filter appllied to voice data
05:37:49 <Lithuania2478845> Why not?
05:37:54 <rny> Lithuania2478845: ask your cia handler to buy you a voice modulation device
05:37:59 <somenerd[m]> don't care if it takes one second
05:38:02 <rny> k, thx, bye
05:38:13 <Lithuania2478845> Operating system integration would be best
05:38:33 <Lithuania2478845> Can i code the feature into the os myself?
05:38:35 <rny> i'll do it if your cia handler can front some money on bountysource
05:38:43 <somenerd[m]> ask purism
05:38:46 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: you're free to make your own builds
05:38:52 <somenerd[m]> they like theatr
05:38:59 <somenerd[m]>  * they like theatre
05:39:02 <strcat> somenerd[m]: would prefer not even bringing it up
05:39:05 <take_a_deep_brea> Lithuania2478845: that has no use case for a regular user . as if i dont want someone to recognize my voice **i **dont** **talk** **to** **them**
05:39:11 <somenerd[m]> lol ok
05:39:22 <Lithuania2478845> You guys have used mp3 tone and pitch changers right? So you can make bass sound like treble etc, same idea just apllied to voice instead of mp3 data
05:39:28 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: we aren't implementing it
05:39:39 <strcat> or shipping it
05:39:42 <strcat> use end-to-end encryption calls
05:39:47 <strcat> insecure calls are deprecated
05:39:52 * rny laughs out loud.
05:40:08 <Lithuania2478845> Yeah i know  it would just be useful for standard calls
05:40:21 <strcat> *insecure* calls
05:40:24 <strcat> and they would still be insecure
05:40:26 <somenerd[m]> no what?
05:40:31 <strcat> so why not just use a secure call
05:40:31 <Lithuania2478845> Voice print analysis is hard to evade ans widespread
05:40:40 <strcat> use Signal or Matrix for calls
05:40:56 <Lithuania2478845> Calling utility services, businesses that obly have standard calls
05:41:12 <strcat> tell them to install Signal
05:41:24 <Lithuania2478845> A voice modulator would allow for privacy
05:41:29 <strcat> no
05:41:36 <strcat> just tell them to install Signal
05:41:40 <Lithuania2478845> Then they cant recognize my voice as easily
05:42:24 <somenerd[m]> but they know who you are?
05:42:38 <Lithuania2478845> The voice modular would benefit the use cases where you have to make an insecure call
05:42:55 <Lithuania2478845> Then with the VoiceMod your pitch can be changed slightly
05:43:01 <strcat> we don't want it
05:43:03 <strcat> told you 100 times
05:43:12 <Lithuania2478845> Making automated nsa bulk surveillience harder to match the voice
05:43:26 <Lithuania2478845> Its a legit security feature
05:43:30 <take_a_deep_brea> Lithuania2478845: graphene OS can not implement these features as firstly they are too niche and secondly it really is not a fool proof way to guarding ones identity
05:43:42 <rny> strcat: oh no
05:43:45 <Lithuania2478845> I dont understand why your so opposed to it
05:43:47 <strcat> it doesn't work
05:43:49 <rny> are you preparing a new release?
05:43:53 <strcat> rny: yes
05:44:00 <strcat> rny: not started yet building kernels and Vanadium
05:44:06 <strcat> and need to rebuild kernels with madaidan[m]'s changes anyway
05:44:07 <rny> strcat: can you review the PR
05:44:09 <rny> when i rebase
05:44:11 <strcat> yes
05:44:13 <strcat> probably
05:44:24 <take_a_deep_brea> <Lithuania2478845 "I dont understand why your so op"> we are trying to explain why we are not interested
05:44:25 <strcat> going to be a huge amount of work for this release
05:44:28 <TheLoneWanderer[> pinf
05:44:42 <strcat> I forgot to do a depot_tools thing and had to redo builds for Vanadium
05:44:46 <strcat> really annoying
05:44:48 <take_a_deep_brea> Lithuania2478845:  dont make it look like we are being blunt
05:45:07 <strcat> take_a_deep_brea: they've brought up the same thing 100 times before
05:45:10 <Lithuania2478845> Automated voice print identification is occuring all the time on non encrypted calls
05:45:15 <strcat> they've brought it up in the channel and emailed me about it
05:45:18 <strcat> 100 times
05:45:30 <Lithuania2478845> It was like 2-5 times
05:45:39 <Lithuania2478845> Realistically
05:45:45 <somenerd[m]> people get sick of these things
05:45:51 <strcat> okay 5 times where you mentioned it 20 times
05:45:54 <strcat> this doesn't count as 1 time
05:45:56 <somenerd[m]> I think everyone knows that he's being hyperbolic
05:46:03 <strcat> I'm not actually
05:46:08 <Lithuania2478845> Im not sick, i want a voicemod bevause it prevents voiceprint analysis
05:46:12 <strcat> count how many times it's mentioned here
05:46:19 <strcat> it's at least like 10 right
05:46:23 <somenerd[m]> welp yeah
05:46:36 <somenerd[m]> so approx 100 times
05:46:40 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: we're not going to start wanting it
05:46:46 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: we don't want it, for good
05:46:51 <Lithuania2478845> Why?
05:46:57 <Lithuania2478845> It should be easy
05:47:03 <strcat> it doesn't provide meaningful protections
05:47:11 <strcat> and the correct approach is using secure calls
05:47:26 <Lithuania2478845> Voice modulation is safer more private than using raw voice
05:47:27 <strcat> insecure calls and texts become less and less important
05:47:32 <somenerd[m]> even if it is good
05:47:32 <somenerd[m]>  * even if it is easy
05:47:33 <somenerd[m]> a lot of things are easy
05:47:33 <somenerd[m]> but we won't implement them
05:47:51 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: look, we're not doing it
05:48:05 <Lithuania2478845> I mean what if i pay you $40 ? :-)
05:48:10 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: it belongs in an app even if it was a reasonable idea
05:48:19 <Lithuania2478845> Ok
05:48:19 <strcat> the amount of time I've spent replying here in this conversation
05:48:23 <strcat> is already more than $40
05:48:55 <strcat> if you actually want to get it implemented then be prepared to pay some developer $5000 and we are not doing it in GrapheneOS
05:49:08 <Lithuania2478845> I mean i can do it with an app
05:49:09 <rny> strcat: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/56/commits/a03d8d461010cc9e2cde9c1c913e7b14d29df0c7
05:49:34 <Lithuania2478845> But inlined with os is more reliable
05:49:38 <take_a_deep_brea> Lithuania2478845: any feature added is basically non trivial amount of code added . its like an increase in attack surface . so any feature has to justify its existence as it means extra work for every release if it has to be to the projects standards . and lets face it , voice modulation i am certain has many workarounds
05:49:40 <somenerd[m]> no
05:49:41 <somenerd[m]> bye
05:49:43 <strcat[m]> rny: did you test the various error cases with it?
05:49:44 <somenerd[m]> stop please
05:49:51 <somenerd[m]> (Lithuania)
05:49:51 <strcat[m]> rny: time set way back, way forward
05:49:53 <rny> past/future yes
05:50:01 <strcat[m]> rny: can you test that the build date check works too?
05:50:03 <strcat[m]> if you didn't
05:50:05 <strcat[m]> hmm
05:50:10 <strcat[m]> guess that's hard
05:50:25 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: belongs in an app
05:50:32 <strcat> Lithuania2478845: everything that can be done in an app should be done in an app
05:50:50 <strcat> unless there is some actual reason to stick it in the base OS and there isn't
05:50:54 <strcat> and we don't want it regardless
05:51:09 <rny> maybe its a good time to discuss grapheneos-specific feature unit tests
05:51:18 <rny> and a standard-ish way to do them across the project
05:52:02 <Lithuania2478845> Any way to update graphene os via TOR
05:52:18 <Lithuania2478845> To prevent targeted update attacks
05:54:25 <rny> big troll
05:54:48 <take_a_deep_brea> weird guy

07:22:58 <strcat[m]> bubba77safe: sounds like your internet connection isn't working properly
07:23:12 <strcat[m]> bubba77safe: are you getting a warning from the OS about that?
07:23:23 <strcat[m]> how are you connecting to the internet? Wi-Fi? mobile data?
07:23:29 <strcat[m]> have you tried changing that?
07:34:02 <bubba77safe[m]> My wifi connection is good. I have 2 routers and tried both. Both showing good connection.......the only recent change i made was under permissions. I denied access to a load of sensors. Even if this play a role then a reset should have fixed it........i have not yet inserted a sim card as am still in the process of switching over from iOS device.
07:34:49 <strcat[m]> bubba77safe: well, definitely sounds like your network connection is messed up
07:34:57 <strcat[m]> maybe something wrong with your Wi-Fi network, or something that you changed
07:35:27 <strcat[m]> try putting in the SIM to see if mobile data works, will save a lot of time
07:35:33 <strcat[m]> will take a while to connect
07:40:08 <bubba77safe[m]> @strcat:matrix.org Before doing a sim swap, the device can connect to cnn.com but not bromite or duckduckgo
07:40:36 <strcat[m]> okay sounds like your DNS is broken
07:40:49 <strcat[m]> it's most likely your Wi-Fi network that's the problem
07:41:02 <strcat[m]> or your ISP DNS
07:41:16 <strcat[m]> or the router's local forwarding DNS
07:41:17 <strcat[m]> to that
07:41:36 <strcat[m]> bubba77safe: or your time is set totally wrong and you're getting certificate errors
07:41:55 <strcat[m]> you're not saying what kind of error
07:43:42 <bubba77safe[m]> The browser says ‘site cannot be reached’ and below ‘bromite.org is unreachable’ and on bottom of screen inside browser says ‘ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE’
07:44:35 <strcat[m]> your network is just broken
07:44:52 <strcat[m]> don't know why, but it is, maybe it's only IPv6 that's broken - don't know, you'll need to debug it
07:45:01 <strcat[m]> I doubt you'll have issues with other Wi-Fi networks or with mobile data
07:48:52 <bubba77safe[m]> Put in sim card. Error says ‘duckduckgo.com server IP address could not be found’ and below ‘ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED’
07:51:43 <bubba77safe[m]> My daily driver (iOS) device works fine w/ and w/o sim card. Unfortunately this is the second 4XL this happened on. I didn’t go about changing settings in a scientific way but anecdotally this issue appeared after i made changes in permissions - in sensors section
07:52:59 <strcat> bubba77safe[m]: turn off Wi-Fi
07:53:07 <strcat> your Wi-Fi network appears to be broken
07:53:34 <strcat> bubba77safe[m]: this isn't an issue with GrapheneOS or the phone, your network is broken
07:53:48 <strcat> don't really know how else to say it
07:54:11 <strcat> another device working on it doesn't mean the network isn't broken
07:54:46 <strcat> it means that other device manages to work around the breakage or doesn't do things in a way that hit it - maybe they use IPv6 less aggressively or whatever the issue is that's being uncovered
07:54:54 <strcat> you have no problem with your OS / phone
07:55:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I can debug ipv6 if you need it
07:55:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have access to an ipv6 only network afaik
07:55:31 <strcat> bubba77safe[m]: if you changed something that might have broke it just factory reset again and this time don't mess with those settings
07:56:15 <strcat> bubba77safe[m]: connect to your network, don't mess with settings especially for system apps, maybe you turned off Network access for something important, don't know, but either you messed it up or the network is broken
07:56:29 <strcat> more likely seems to be that the network is broken
07:56:37 <strcat> DNS not working, IPv6 not working, something like that
07:56:54 <strcat> disable Wi-Fi and get connected to the mobile network to try mobile data
07:57:02 <strcat> if that works, that's good, then try another unrelated Wi-Fi network
08:43:37 <TheJollyRoger> This is so weird. "all checks have failed" and then suddenly" "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch" How strange!
08:44:05 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: those are different things
08:44:07 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: checks is the CI stuff I put in place
08:44:12 <strcat[m]> where it runs validate_static and process_static
08:44:29 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Uh...
08:45:23 <TheJollyRoger> I'll go and take a closer look. I wonder if it got interrupted when I renamed the whole thing since it was in the process of validating when I renamed it due to a typo.
08:47:00 <TheJollyRoger> I decided I would break it up into separate commits, I decided to add your existing stuff first, then put the ones that immediately came to mind in place after it.
08:48:54 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, weird, no error, but it's still marked as an X. Might've been what happened when I interrupted it.
09:00:18 <TheJollyRoger> There goes the tide again.
09:00:27 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, nevermind. Just the ones that were idle for thirty days...
09:03:54 <strcat> still sucks
09:04:01 <strcat> they need to fix that
09:04:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, really...
09:04:06 <TheJollyRoger> Rrgh.
09:04:23 <strcat> wonder if we can get that prioritized somehow
09:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I don't know, honestly, I'll go see if I can find out what it'd take to upgrade the room without losing all our history.
09:08:09 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: I'm kinda kicking myself over not doing this earlier before the web installer, but... I decided I'd add that troubleshooting page, it's just a stub at the moment, if it's still needed.
09:09:05 <strcat[m]> web installer is really good
09:09:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
09:09:17 <strcat[m]> we need to deal with all the legacy install videos not following the proper CLI guide somehow
09:09:29 <strcat[m]>  * we need to deal with all the legacy third party install videos not following the proper CLI guide somehow
09:09:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm...
09:09:54 <strcat[m]> either they need to be updated to follow the official CLI guide (most never followed even the older versions of it)
09:09:56 <strcat[m]> or they should be taken down...
09:09:57 <somenerd[m]> > we need to deal with all the legacy third party install videos not following the proper CLI guide somehow
09:09:57 <somenerd[m]> the WebUSB can help a lot
09:10:04 <TheJollyRoger> That, I'm currently out of ideas on, unfortunately.
09:10:06 <strcat[m]> the videos are causing a lot of issues
09:10:18 <somenerd[m]> and some guide creators aren't exactly cooperative
09:10:38 <strcat[m]> it would be fine if they actually followed the CLI guide and referenced it + told people to have it opem
09:10:41 <strcat[m]>  * it would be fine if they actually followed the CLI guide and referenced it + told people to have it open
09:10:46 <strcat[m]> for people to read the info they leave out
09:10:48 <somenerd[m]> some are pretty decent though
09:10:56 <strcat[m]> yeah but many aren't
09:11:06 <strcat[m]> and all of them age and become worse over time unless the creator keeps it updated
09:11:11 <somenerd[m]> the 2 popular ones are like polar opposited
09:11:20 <somenerd[m]> one actually references the guide
09:11:31 <somenerd[m]> and the other makes people install random third party packages
09:11:41 <somenerd[m]>  * the 2 popular ones are like polar opposites
09:11:55 <strcat[m]> other uses third party software, bricks devices, and then has a follow up telling you to remove the version check someone spent time porting to Windows for us
09:12:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
09:12:20 <somenerd[m]> and makes a troubleshoot guide
09:12:24 <somenerd[m]> and attacks devs
09:12:33 <strcat[m]> but yeah hopefully the web installer alleviates a lot of this
09:12:36 <somenerd[m]> again, sorta polar opposites
09:12:41 <somenerd[m]> > but yeah hopefully the web installer alleviates a lot of this
09:12:42 <somenerd[m]> probably will
09:12:43 <strcat[m]> it's really good
09:13:03 <TheJollyRoger> I hope so! I really like it, I can't wait to try it out if/when I get another device.
09:13:03 <somenerd[m]> it looks amazing and is gonna change a lot of things
09:13:04 <take_a_deep_brea> true
09:13:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
09:13:10 <strcat[m]> if you have a spare device it's worth trying just cause it'
09:13:13 <strcat[m]> it's pretty cool
09:13:18 <strcat[m]>  * if you have a spare device it's worth trying just cause
09:13:20 <take_a_deep_brea> should lower barrier to adoption
09:13:35 * TheJollyRoger looks at his USB SSD where his seedvault backups are kept.
09:13:41 * TheJollyRoger looks at his last remaining phone.
09:13:48 * TheJollyRoger looks back at his USB SSD where his seedvault backups are kept.
09:13:57 <TheJollyRoger> Aaargh I'm so tempted!
09:14:34 <nullnode[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "should lower barrier to adoption"> That's not always the best thing
09:15:35 <nullnode[m]> If too many ill equipped people start running grapheneos it might bog down the advancement focusing on usability and accessibility.
09:16:35 <nullnode[m]> If too many ill equipped people start running grapheneos it might bog down the advancement focusing on usability and accessibility.
09:17:21 <nullnode[m]> When normal mom and dads get thrown onto devices running GrapheneOS they may have to do unsafe things to reach the usability they are familiar with.
09:17:35 <nullnode[m]> Apps without proper update paths etc
09:17:37 <take_a_deep_brea> nullnode:  wdym by ill equipped?
09:17:42 <strcat[m]> I really want hardware partnerships so we need to get more attention for the project
09:17:46 <strcat[m]> which includes resolving some like
09:17:55 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
09:17:59 <nullnode[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "nullnode:  wdym by ill equipped?"> Knowledge and skills wise, basic security smarts.
09:18:00 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
09:18:07 <strcat[m]> need to get an eSIM application implementation and an app install/update system with automatic updates and a first party repo
09:19:11 <strcat[m]> and also we really need to resolve the issue of Copperhead continuously trying to harm the project, developers, contributors and supporters
09:19:11 <nullnode[m]> I can get IMSI/KI's for eSIM testing possibly
09:19:35 <nullnode[m]> <strcat[m] "and also we really need to resol"> That's gonna take the RCMP bud
09:19:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ack.
09:19:55 <take_a_deep_brea> RCMP?
09:20:10 <TheJollyRoger> take_a_deep_brea: the RCMP is the equivalent of Canada's federal police.
09:20:12 <nullnode[m]> Royal Canadian Mounted Police, our FBI rides horses.
09:20:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
09:20:23 <digiscales[m]> <strcat "wonder if we can get that priori"> Is there any plan to implement an alternative push message system on GOS?
09:20:32 <strcat> digiscales[m]: many apps do
09:20:47 <strcat> digiscales[m]: they don't need us to provide something
09:20:48 <nullnode[m]> I think he means an MDM admin app
09:20:49 <TheJollyRoger> Although unfortunately the old-style campaign hats, and the big red coats and puffy pants are kind of well, those are the dress uniforms for tourists, they don't actually wear them all the time like on TV :P
09:20:52 <mishmasher[m]> Lmao at the voice change dude🤣
09:20:55 <strcat> and us providing something does no good without apps using it
09:22:06 <nullnode[m]> Would MDM functions possibly be a future feature for attestation? Make sure device complies with basic policy sets, etc
09:22:25 <mishmasher[m]> Really don't see a benefit in the voice change feature, and if you really want it that bad buy a voice changer from aliexpress its like $10🤣
09:22:43 <nullnode[m]> Only think I miss from stock is my Group Policy sync from Azure AD
09:23:21 <strcat> mishmasher[m]: he's a regular
09:23:26 <strcat> not the only thing he wants
09:23:29 <strcat> always a new username name
09:23:38 <strcat> can always tell it's the same person within a couple messages
09:23:41 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately yes.
09:24:13 <strcat> always using a VPN, making a new account, instantly seen to be the same person
09:24:28 <strcat> mishmasher[m]: I really do not think they're a troll
09:24:34 <strcat> and I don't think they're trying to cause trouble
09:24:43 <strcat> they have issues
09:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> So far I've found that broken-record conversation works wonders on him though.
09:25:02 <strcat> that's why I don't ban them, despite them being super annoying at times
09:25:09 <strcat> often he seems to come to an understanding
09:25:11 <strcat> and agrees
09:25:15 <mishmasher[m]> strcat: hahaha but, gotta admit the CIA handler part was funny🤣
09:25:16 <strcat> and then next day he's back on the same topic
09:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> "We discussed this yesterday/last week. My answer has not changed since then." CTRL-C, then CTRL-V it as often as you need.
09:25:49 <strcat> I think (hope) he gets LTE only mode now and isn't going to keep hyping it as making cellular network texts/calls secure
09:26:07 <strcat> lol I just don't get why he seems to understand
09:26:10 <strcat> then goes back to the same thing
09:26:18 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat "always using a VPN, making a new"> strcat's skill is so high-level, he knows when someone is using a VPN 👀
09:26:21 <nullnode[m]> Lol, secure communications throw a cell network, roflmao
09:26:32 <TheJollyRoger> I've been able to get him to stop plugging Libreboot and Trisequel using the "Broken record" method.
09:26:44 <TheJollyRoger> At least, temporarily.
09:26:57 <TheJollyRoger> So... use it as much as you need.
09:27:54 <nullnode[m]> Libreboot is pretty good... If you got an old lenovo that has 100+ Intel vulnerabilities painted on the silicon, lol
09:27:56 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Why would you even plug Triqsuel?
09:28:02 <strcat> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: well he uses IRC, it tells you his IP
09:28:05 <TheJollyRoger> I mean, if he's going to be a broken record as us, might as well do the same.
09:28:13 <TheJollyRoger> nullnode[m]: hahaahaha yes XD
09:28:19 <nullnode[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Why would you even plug Triqsuel"> Richard Stallman told me to at HOPE in NYC
09:28:37 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: I think he does because he's the embodiment of a Self-Defeating Power User.
09:28:40 <nullnode[m]> "What can I do Mr Stallman?"
09:28:40 <nullnode[m]> "Do more."
09:28:54 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Why would you even plug Triqsuel"> I mean, if we are talking about Libre distros, then Guix at least looks interesting and unique
09:29:21 <strcat> rny: I'll do a new release soon with your ntp stuff, was just too close to this one and I'd started already
09:29:33 <TheJollyRoger> Go strcat, go!
09:29:47 <Ruby[m]1> Hi, all. I am noob, and have a question. Porting GrapheneOS to any non-Pixel devices is not easy?
09:29:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "SkyFox [kde.org]: I think he doe"> They are playing 5D chess with their own system!
09:30:11 <strcat[m]> Ruby: see https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
09:30:23 <strcat[m]> most devices don't have what's needed and none that are available offer comparable security
09:30:37 <strcat[m]> you can run an incomplete port on anything that can run an AOSP build
09:30:46 <strcat[m]> but it's not really going to be a real port without the proper hardware support
09:31:10 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Ruby[m]1, it's what people at OEMs are usually paid six figure salaries to work on full time. GrapheneOS will compile for and run on devices it doesn't officially support, but vendors that aren't Google actually do not allow us to use important security features like verified boot.
09:31:13 <strcat[m]> also see https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400
09:32:06 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung, for instance, is actively *hostile* to this and will permanently blow a Knox fuse in your device and void your warranty if you unlock the bootloader,  in addition to disabling important security features like verified boot for other operating systems.
09:32:40 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: Hee hee, computer security jenga too! How high can you go before it comes crashing down!
09:33:11 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
09:33:45 <Ruby[m]1> Oh.. I didn't know that, despite of having in mind that I wish to port it to Samsung Galaxy..
09:35:05 <strcat[m]> we want to work with hardware vendors to have them at least make their regular devices better
09:35:21 <strcat[m]> ideally, we'd have hardware partners making devices suiting our needs
09:35:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ruby[m]1: In theory, with the right programming skills it might be possible to compile your own OS for a Samsung Galaxy, but Samsung won't let you lock the bootloader on your own keys, meaning you'll be walking around with a device that has no security features.
09:35:28 <strcat[m]> built to run GrapheneOS
09:35:52 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: well, missing most of the hardware-based security features
09:36:07 <TheJollyRoger> Ack, whoop, yeah.
09:36:17 <strcat[m]> verified boot, attestation, proper hardware keystore functionality, hardware encryption support, other HSM functionality and so on
09:36:34 * TheJollyRoger hurriedly straightens his hat nervously.
09:36:36 <strcat[m]> and they have kernel security features done in a different way that's more heavily tied to their hw
09:37:01 <TheJollyRoger> Wh-what's the likelihood they also have precompiled binary drivers, as well...? Just kinda curious.
09:37:06 <strcat[m]> they use their own sketchy CFI instead of Clang CFI and have stuff like TEE-based integrity protection and a hypervisor for approving page table changes
09:37:17 <strcat[m]> mostly not enabled on consumer phones
09:37:29 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: dunno, doubt they do, all their kernel drivers are probably open source
09:37:33 <strcat[m]> at least the ones shipping with it
09:37:49 <strcat[m]> I'm sure they add more proprietary userspace libraries
09:39:10 <TheJollyRoger> That kinda makes sense. I know someone who has one of their Note phones and it has this weird proprietary stylus pen on it, which is pretty nice, but the funny thing is that that pen doesn't work anywhere else and they mentioned it's something unique to Samsung, so I started wondering if it needed some weird driver package that's not common to Android or something.
09:40:33 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: their pens are fancy stuff that needs to charge
09:40:51 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: another device wouldn't be able to charge it let alone use it
09:41:12 <TheJollyRoger> Wha-- woah. Ohhhh oh wow it's like an active pen...
09:41:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yipes. I didn't realize that at all.
09:41:44 <strcat> it also updates the firmware on it
09:41:54 <TheJollyRoger> Wow. Makes sense.
09:42:09 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-s-pen-the-ultimate-guide-925944/
09:42:16 * TheJollyRoger hurriedly reads.
09:42:21 <strcat[m]> they add a ton of code to AOSP
09:42:28 <strcat[m]> this is just an overview of the pen stuff
09:42:35 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: they reinvent lots of wheels
09:42:41 <strcat[m]> add their whole own implementation of lots of stuff
09:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> Oh good gravy.
09:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah! Yeah that's it, that's the exact one in that picture, I think.
09:43:02 <strcat[m]> this is why despite having immense resources it takes them so long beyond the release of a major OS to move to it despite their very early access to it
09:43:37 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, wait, no it's not. The one I saw is an older one... but it looked kinda similar.
09:43:40 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, sheesh.
09:44:59 <strcat[m]> love how they have a social network based on the S-Pen
09:45:45 <TheJollyRoger> Good gravy.
09:45:52 <take_a_deep_brea> weird
09:46:15 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: often they make something useful but it's usually designed in a really janky way with a really sketchy implementation
09:46:20 <strcat[m]> they add tons of stuff
09:46:30 <strcat[m]> a lot eventually gets added to AOSP in a much better way
09:46:51 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: people who like their stuff like having the ridiculous amount of features despite all the janky / sketchy stuff
09:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> That's a pity, when something that's actually kinda useful just isn't a good design.
09:48:00 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: they also have alternatives to most Google apps / services of their own so you have 2 versions (or more) of everything out of the box
09:48:04 <strcat[m]> and tons and tons of bundled stuff
09:48:18 <strcat[m]> often facebook app as a system app, stuff like that, too
09:48:23 <strcat[m]> and system properties for it
09:48:24 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yuck!
09:48:27 <strcat[m]> facebook OS integration
09:49:59 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
09:50:27 <TheJollyRoger> Man. Really glad I didn't go down that road back in ~2016 when I was starting to look for a phone.
09:50:30 <take_a_deep_brea> its absolutely ridiculous amount of bloat . i know cause my whole family uses samsung .... what an eye sore
09:50:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yikes.
09:50:43 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
09:50:44 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Not to mention all the preinstalled apps in their ROM
09:50:44 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat[m] "TheJollyRoger: they also have al"> Aren't they shipping MS apps?
09:50:45 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Also make that 3 version in countries like Russia, where they also ship Yandex stuff
09:50:45 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m>  * Also make that 3 versions in countries like Russia, where they also ship Yandex stuff
09:50:56 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Iirc, Russia pretty much requires OEMs to ship Russian apps now
09:50:57 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
09:51:03 <take_a_deep_brea> MS stuff too
09:51:04 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> So Yandex, VK, MailRU, etc.
09:51:05 * TheJollyRoger turns a shade of green and his cheeks bulge.
09:51:10 <TheLoneWanderer[> Why though? Why spend time and money just to reinvent the wheel?
09:51:28 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> To have copyright
09:51:50 <strcat[m]> Samsung has the ambition of making phones without Google apps and services
09:51:57 <strcat[m]> it would be great if they actually did it
09:52:02 <strcat[m]> and others
09:52:21 <strcat[m]> so then apps would be forced to implement alternatives to Play services
09:52:36 <strcat[m]> need more other vendors  shipping Android compatible OSes without Play services
09:52:43 <strcat[m]> so app devs actually have to target Android
09:52:50 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yeah, this is probably why Google isn't pushing more security features or custom keys to OEMs. Because they'll just leave
09:52:54 <strcat[m]> not Android + Play services (Play is not included in baseline Android)
09:53:19 <COPE> There is over 1000 people on here chatting about GrapheneOS?
09:53:27 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Yeah, this is probably why Googl"> Chinese OEMs pretty much already have their own services and stores in China
09:53:33 <TheLoneWanderer[> Good to know
09:53:43 <strcat[m]> COPE: yes unfortunately Matrix kicks users who don't talk for 30+ days - otherwise there would be more
09:53:53 <strcat[m]> COPE: trying to get that resolved
09:54:16 <strcat[m]> COPE: most people aren't currently active, of course
09:54:41 <COPE> How many people are talking right now?
09:54:46 <strcat[m]> but a lot will read some of the scrollback
09:55:21 <strcat[m]> COPE: IRC / Matrix is quite asynchronous so any of the people in the channel could read something and reply later
09:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: yeah, I heard that after Huawei burned their bridge with Google they decided to start their own ecosystem. I don't know what's become of that though and I don't think it's really relevant to what we do.
09:55:30 <strcat[m]> can't really answer that
09:55:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "SkyFox [kde.org]: yeah, I heard "> Some have started releasing apps on their App Gallery
09:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, huh, well that's interesting, on second thought!
09:56:08 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And it wasn't really Huawei who burned the bridge
09:56:17 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow, it was Google? :O
09:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> Oh damn! I didn't realize that!
09:56:25 <strcat[m]> the US federal government
09:56:31 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> ^
09:56:32 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
09:56:39 <strcat[m]> put them on a list of companies US companies aren't allowed to do business with
09:56:41 <TheJollyRoger> OHHHH this had to do with the ban, right, right, now I recall.
09:56:41 <strcat[m]> even indirectly
09:56:53 <TheJollyRoger> D'oh.
09:57:00 <TheJollyRoger> Guess I'm a bit more drunk than I thought right now, ha.
09:57:05 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> But yeah, Xiaomi have their own store and services too
09:57:15 * TheJollyRoger whistles appreciatively.
09:57:18 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: meanwhile you know those 'blackberry' phones? they are made by TCL (they just bought the brand) and TCL is literally owned by the Chinese government directly, it's not independent
09:57:27 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: and US is happy to use those
09:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: Hohohohohoho man.
09:57:36 * TheJollyRoger laughs way too hard.
09:57:50 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Huawei bad because 5G
09:57:51 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCL_Technology
09:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> I knew Blackberry killed their hardware division and instead started buying imported handsets, scratching the labels off, and throwing their own branded homebrewed Android fork onto it, but damn that's ironic.
09:58:27 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: seems BlackBerry can start making phones with their brand again at some point
09:58:29 <strcat[m]> or license it elsewhere
09:58:37 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "But yeah, Xiaomi have their own "> I bet other Chinese OEMs have as well. Then you also have Samsung
09:59:16 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Blackberry is stuck in the past with the design, imo
09:59:16 <rny> strcat[m]: samsung would do that and they'd chain their users to their own samsung ecosystem
09:59:20 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> No one wants the keyboard
09:59:30 <rny> RE: samsung wants to build without google apps/services
09:59:54 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: so seems they don't have the BlackBerry brand anymore but they have Palm now
10:00:07 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the whole thing is just so weird
10:00:22 <strcat[m]> fearmongering about 1 Chinese company while being fine with other state owned or largely state controlled ones
10:00:29 <rny> wow, i havent seen a palm for like decades
10:00:40 <rny> i still remember one of those palm PDA devices
10:01:02 <strcat[m]> rny: https://palm.com/
10:01:06 <strcat[m]> rny: TCL owned brand now
10:01:19 <rny> is this the same palm as the one that manufactured PDAs?
10:01:30 <strcat[m]> rny: they bought the brand
10:01:32 <strcat[m]> rny: it's the same brand
10:01:37 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with the old company
10:01:52 <strcat[m]> same as the new Nokia
10:01:56 <strcat[m]> and the TCL BlackBerry phones
10:02:11 <strcat[m]> new Nokia is not old Nokia
10:02:15 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat[m] "fearmongering about 1 Chinese co"> Tbf, Huawei was a more independent company at the time, imo. They even had their own SoCs
10:02:15 <strcat[m]> rather they bought the brand
10:02:18 <TheJollyRoger> I still remember those palm devices, and having to do things like draw weird heiroglyphics to produce an "a" and then having to draw in one way to produce a "b" and then if you drew it wrong you'd end up with a "j"
10:02:38 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: what a double standard >_<
10:02:39 <rny> kirin is a decent soc
10:03:03 <rny> but the fabs boycott huawei and wont build their socs anymore
10:03:11 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> But now ARM can't or won't do business with Huawei
10:03:25 <somenerd[m]> > I still remember those palm devices, and having to do things like draw weird heiroglyphics to produce an "a" and then having to draw in one way to produce a "b" and then if you drew it wrong you'd end up with a "j"
10:03:25 <strcat[m]> rny: Qualcomm just bought a ARM CPU design company  btw
10:03:25 <somenerd[m]> lol wut
10:03:38 <strcat[m]> rny: with a bunch of former Apple A series people
10:03:52 <rny> strcat[m]: O_O
10:03:57 <strcat[m]> so likely in ~2 years their CPUs will start being decent again
10:04:03 <rny> whats wrong with qualcomm as is?
10:04:08 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I still don't think Qualcomm will put in 100% of the effort
10:04:12 <strcat[m]> rny: they just ship the ARM Cortex designs
10:04:23 <strcat[m]> they're meh and just the same as everything else
10:04:24 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: it's a separate CPU division they bought
10:04:26 <rny> the snapdragon is still the best of socs in the class
10:04:30 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "I still don't think Qualcomm wil"> Afaik, they have no real competitors
10:04:32 <strcat[m]> not being dissolved or anything
10:04:45 <strcat[m]> rny: yeah but the CPU is just a standard ARM Cortex core
10:04:50 <strcat[m]> as opposed to everything else that's really good
10:05:06 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: oh yeah, if you had one of those old palmtop PDAs, you had to use the pen input on the "drawing area" to do certain combinations to enter letters, and some of them depended on which direction you moved the stylus, I couldn't get the hang of it as a kid.
10:05:09 <strcat[m]> really good GPU, best radios, best DSPs, etc.
10:05:41 <rny> ok, hopefully their new line of socs dont cost an arm and a leg
10:05:43 <strcat[m]> rny: they're missing a proper high end SoC with a competitive CPU not just everything else best in class
10:05:48 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Afaik, they have no real competi"> Apple won't sell their SoCs to anyone else, and among those who do sell SoCs Qualcomm outperforms everyone afaik
10:06:01 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm wants to make server CPUs
10:06:16 <strcat[m]> so they bought this ARM server CPU focused company but they'll be using it for mobile too
10:06:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, fancy that, and meanwhile CloudFlare wants to abandon the x86 and go to ARM. How convenient!
10:06:36 <rny> meh, x86 can afford to drop prices
10:06:46 <strcat[m]> Intel CPUs are so bad now
10:06:51 * TheJollyRoger snickers.
10:07:02 <rny> this latest generation seem to be more price-competitive
10:07:07 <rny> re: intel chips
10:07:23 <strcat[m]> rny: amd is still destroying them especially for a workstation / server
10:07:37 <rny> true
10:07:41 <strcat[m]> rny: and it's not like the AMD CPUs are really that amazing, Intel is just doing horribly
10:07:48 <rny> can always get a beaten down xeon if you dont care about spectre
10:07:52 <strcat[m]> their fab stuff failed completely
10:07:53 <rny> :P
10:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee hee
10:07:59 <strcat[m]> they are 2 gens behind on fabricating CPUs
10:08:11 <somenerd[m]> > can always get a beaten down xeon if you dont care about spectre
10:08:11 <somenerd[m]> wonder how many people care here...
10:08:20 <somenerd[m]> this being a privacy and security related room
10:08:22 <TheJollyRoger> I've got high-apple-pie-in-the-sky hopes for POWER10 and POWER11!
10:08:34 <rny> if its offline and you run software that you vet, you can probably turn off all mitigations
10:08:46 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: well, for a cheap headless build server, it might actually be a fairly viable idea.
10:08:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And all the while M1s outperform x86 in almost everything that matters to regular consumers
10:09:09 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: well, for a cheap headless build server, it might actually be a fairly viable idea.
10:09:09 <somenerd[m]> I mean, if it's meant to be secure though...
10:09:18 <somenerd[m]> for example for GrapheneOS builds
10:09:21 <TheJollyRoger> And OpenPOWER is likely going to be eating Intel's lunch from the top end.
10:09:22 <somenerd[m]> (unofficial)
10:09:26 <rny> when we talk about secure
10:09:31 <rny> secure against what?
10:10:03 <somenerd[m]> targeted attacks
10:10:11 <rny> if you're building offline with software you've already vet and confident does not do funny things, then dont see why turning off spectre mitigations is a bad idea.
10:10:19 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: well, if it's only running executables you're sure are legitimate, then you're still alright... the issue though is if you run something like a web browser.
10:10:22 <rny> you squeeze as much juice out of your CPU as possible
10:10:28 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: well, if it's only running executables you're sure are legitimate, then you're still alright... the issue though is if you run something like a web browser.
10:10:29 <somenerd[m]> hmmm
10:10:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <rny "you squeeze as much juice out of"> Exploits won't run, if there's no CPU time left
10:11:18 <TheJollyRoger> So that's why in a very niche situation like an offline build server, if you're on a budget, it's not the end of the world and you might be able to get it for a good price, in a pinch.
10:11:19 <rny> ha, never yield the cpu
10:11:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hahahahahahaa
10:11:32 <somenerd[m]> lol
10:12:26 <somenerd[m]> Imagine if that becomes a security strategy
10:12:35 <rny> terrible ux though
10:12:41 <somenerd[m]> "if you run 1000 apps, malware can't run"
10:12:45 <rny> if you ran a program that is unstable and it never yields :/
10:12:52 <rny> reboot is the only way
10:13:02 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: This is why for some servers that are only running executables that are vetted, it's not the end of the world. But Spectre *screwed* cloud service providers in such an insanely bad way, because those cloud service providers are running virtual machines, which are most definitely not going to be running executables that everybody trusts, vets, and controls.
10:13:08 <rny> never yields and ignores all signals
10:13:12 * rny face palms
10:13:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "somenerd: This is why for some s"> Hehe, C goes brrrrr
10:14:00 * TheJollyRoger snickers!
10:14:08 <somenerd[m]> lmao
10:14:35 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Hehe, C goes brrrrr"> Maybe not directly with Spectre, but definitely goes brrr
10:15:17 <somenerd[m]> Xen go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
10:15:32 <TheJollyRoger> Someday, I would like to see what it'd take to get the Android Toolchain to work on POWER, but it's likely that that is going to take a *lot* of work.
10:15:42 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Xen goes "relinquished VGA control" :(
10:16:52 <TheJollyRoger> The good news is, Clang works just fine and Golang works perfectly. rustc will *build* for POWER and some code will compile but unfortunately rust is missing a number of libraries for POWER.
10:17:22 <TheJollyRoger> As would be expected, Java and Python work on POWER although I'm missing some modules.
10:17:35 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Does Android use Rust in its toolchain?
10:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think so, but I know that GrapheneOS may in a future date start using Rust as a replacement for C in some areas.
10:18:20 <somenerd[m]> and most new code is meant to be written in Rust
10:18:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
10:18:43 <TheJollyRoger> Right now I'm following efforts to get Ada to work on POWER.
10:18:58 <TheJollyRoger> In little Endian.
10:19:00 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <somenerd[m] "and most new code is meant to be"> Ah, _the Windows policy_
10:19:23 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Ah, _the Windows policy_"> At least for drivers :P
10:19:50 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "Right now I'm following efforts "> 🤔 I'd expect the GNU compiler to work
10:20:06 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: so far, I haven't had any problems with it!
10:20:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "SkyFox [kde.org]: so far, I have"> I mean, the Ada GNU compiler
10:21:21 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Or is something else not working?
10:21:24 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah. It works in glibc Little Endian, I think right now there are just a few kinks to work out for musl.
10:21:29 <TheJollyRoger> To get it to bootstrap.
10:22:04 <TheJollyRoger> After that it should be OK. It'll probably work right now as it is, but I'm not on musl.
10:26:26 <TheJollyRoger> In the future, I think it would be kinda nice if I figured out how to use the computer as a build server. Maybe in the future when there's Talos III, or something.
10:27:15 <somenerd[m]> would be cool if someone made an alternative GrapheneOS server
10:27:44 <somenerd[m]> (by that I mean builds, attestation server, and update server)
10:27:54 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
10:28:14 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> The Build Federation
10:28:18 <somenerd[m]> but they'd have to be a dev or trusted person
10:28:24 <somenerd[m]> > The Build Federation
10:28:24 <somenerd[m]> yeah, basically
10:29:24 <TheJollyRoger> I think if I was going to do it I'd just be easier to give s`trcat the keys, honestly, that way it would remove me from the trust equation.
10:29:36 <somenerd[m]> that may not help
10:29:49 <somenerd[m]> cuz the reason I said this is to decentralize trust
10:30:02 <somenerd[m]> so one person being compromised doesn't affect others
10:30:27 <rny> like bitcoin gitian builds?
10:30:29 <TheJollyRoger> I don't think that actually works out that well in theory: what happens if I turn evil and attempt to subvert the project or abuse the trust placed in me?
10:30:30 <rny> hehe
10:30:52 <somenerd[m]> > I don't think that actually works out that well in theory: what happens if I turn evil and attempt to subvert the project or abuse the trust placed in me?
10:30:52 <somenerd[m]> I mean, you're sorta trusted
10:31:02 <somenerd[m]> and you have a bit of rep in the GrapheneOS community
10:31:06 <TheJollyRoger> The thing is, I'd be /another/ person you'd have to trust, and rather than distribute the trust, that simply adds /another/ person who can sieze control.
10:31:08 <rny> there's an invalid assumption here though, the builder needs to also vet the source code, otherwise root of trust still rests with strcat[m]
10:31:14 <somenerd[m]> hmm
10:31:17 <somenerd[m]> yeah
10:31:23 <somenerd[m]> the other builders have to vet the code
10:31:24 <rny> you'd need to articulate what trust you're decentralizing
10:31:27 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZsOEHWfgqoAkisvufxTtFGOK/message.txt >
10:31:30 <somenerd[m]> lol
10:31:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. "Decentralize" and "distribute" isn't a magical solution.
10:31:48 <somenerd[m]> hmm
10:32:00 <rny> in bitcoin's case, it is a combination of the source code being vetted (much smaller code base) and the toolchain used by builders aren't broken
10:32:01 <somenerd[m]> > you'd need to articulate what trust you're decentralizing
10:32:01 <somenerd[m]> mostly infrastructure
10:32:14 <somenerd[m]> ex: if the attestation server was compromised
10:32:25 <somenerd[m]> or if something else like the keys were
10:32:51 <somenerd[m]> and yes, the code would have to be vetted a lot in order for it to be properly decentralized
10:33:26 <rny> its probably possible to just vet the delta commits on top of aosp
10:33:33 <rny> but to vet aosp, its non-trivial
10:33:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The only problem is... it doesn't really work out that way in practice, especially when we open up the possibility for insider threats to become a very real thing - adding more people into the equation also increases the likelihood of an insider threat or social engineering occurring.
10:33:44 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m thinks just how much resources you'd need to build Android with fully-homomorphic encryption
10:34:03 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: if I think too hard on that, I think my brains will start to dribble out my nose.
10:34:11 <somenerd[m]> > its probably possible to just vet the delta commits on top of aosp
10:34:11 <somenerd[m]> I meant the delta commits
10:34:26 <somenerd[m]> since vetting AOSP is extremely difficult
10:34:36 <TheJollyRoger> Now granted... if we really really really REALLY had to...
10:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> I've actually considered the cost of colocating the Morgan's Revenge.
10:34:59 <somenerd[m]> > Yeah. The only problem is... it doesn't really work out that way in practice, especially when we open up the possibility for insider threats to become a very real thing - adding more people into the equation also increases the likelihood of an insider threat or social engineering occurring.
10:34:59 <somenerd[m]> hmmmmmmm
10:35:02 <somenerd[m]> quite true
10:35:03 <TheJollyRoger> Or purchasing a second one.
10:35:15 <somenerd[m]> since technically, the point of trust doesn't change
10:35:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, that's correct - ultimately, you're not distributing trust, you're adding it.
10:35:48 <somenerd[m]> unless the person is quite good at vetting
10:35:56 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "I've actually considered the cos"> Is that the name of your workstation?
10:36:07 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: yep, the Morgan's Revenge be me ship.
10:36:11 <somenerd[m]> which, to be honest, I don't really know who here could do that
10:36:20 <somenerd[m]> (vet the code)
10:36:36 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Category:Gallery A few pictures of her!
10:36:45 <somenerd[m]> and it would need a considerably large community
10:37:09 <somenerd[m]> (to find other really good AOSP devs who can vet the code)
10:37:25 <TheJollyRoger> Colocating one of these would be doable, but it wouldn't be cheap. I'd need a 4-Unit rack space to fit the thing.
10:37:25 <somenerd[m]> mostly a distribution of infrastructure trust
10:37:30 <somenerd[m]> than trust in general
10:37:50 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "SkyFox [kde.org]: https://wiki.r"> Looks cool
10:38:13 <somenerd[m]> I think we're moving a bit offtopic
10:38:20 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic?
10:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> But that'd be a BIG drain on resources.
10:38:28 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: hehe, it's social hour :P.
10:38:36 <somenerd[m]> lol ok
10:39:03 <TheJollyRoger> Generally as long as we're not displacing on-topic chat, if there's no on-topic chat I'm usually fine with a bit of offtopic banter :)
10:39:21 <somenerd[m]> yeah
10:39:34 <somenerd[m]> <somenerd[m] "since technically, the point of "> decent idea for the future ig
10:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> Distributed builds have actually been discussed a bit in the past, but I think the issue with them is that they suffer from a lot of "but it looked good on paper" factor.
10:39:53 <TheJollyRoger> It is!
10:39:56 <somenerd[m]> once we get from 800 community members to like, maybe a few million people
10:40:03 <somenerd[m]> cuz we can find legit devs
10:40:05 <TheJollyRoger> And I really hope in the future it might be doable.
10:40:11 <somenerd[m]> same
10:40:32 <TheJollyRoger> But there's a big problem with things like for instance, let's say we have an m-of-n signature scheme.
10:40:58 <TheJollyRoger> Say... 3 of 4 people need to sign, we'll say Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dan.
10:41:03 <somenerd[m]> ok
10:41:09 <TheJollyRoger> What happens when Alice, Bob, and Charlie conspire to cut Dan out of the picture?
10:41:52 <somenerd[m]> so if 3 builders conspire to cut out another builder?
10:41:52 <TheJollyRoger> Or what happens when there's a critical security problem, and Alice is MIA and Bob's on holiday without access to his computer?
10:41:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
10:42:22 <somenerd[m]> yeah but with only Alice, if Alice is MIA
10:42:27 <somenerd[m]> the whole thing is shut down
10:42:41 <TheJollyRoger> Then we have an impasse.
10:42:46 <TheJollyRoger> or a deadlock.
10:43:06 <TheJollyRoger> During which, no security updates get pushed. Development stalls. The phones don't get updated.
10:43:08 <strcat> people are welcome to start making their own builds + update server + attestation server
10:43:24 <somenerd[m]> yeah I'm just theorizing
10:43:49 <somenerd[m]> as I don't know how to self host properly, let alone audit anything
10:43:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! Nothing wrong with that, I should stress! Just that there are a lot of hard questions that we'd need to ask ahead of time.
10:43:59 <strcat> if they want to implement and use some kind of multisig signing but stuff is largely designed around having 1 key
10:44:07 <somenerd[m]> true
10:44:08 <strcat> so you'd probably need to use some way of partitioning keys
10:44:15 <somenerd[m]> yeah I'm mostly talking about multiple servers
10:44:21 <somenerd[m]> versus multiple keys to sign
10:44:22 <TheJollyRoger> Since we don't ask them going into it, then we'll have to answer them later... and it gets significantly harder to answer them later.
10:44:31 <somenerd[m]> the 2nd one is harder
10:44:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh like High Availability services?
10:44:44 <somenerd[m]> yeah
10:44:47 <somenerd[m]> sorta like that
10:44:52 <strcat> for example there's inherently 1 verified boot key but maybe there's some way you can still split that
10:45:05 <somenerd[m]> where there are multiple servers and builds around
10:45:27 <strcat> do you want multisig for only updates
10:45:30 <somenerd[m]> so if say, Alice is compromised, the others can still be safe
10:45:31 <strcat> or also all the signatures in the OS?
10:45:37 <somenerd[m]> > do you want multisig for only updates
10:45:37 <somenerd[m]> no this isn't about multisig
10:45:40 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah, yeah, that's perfectly doable... strcat, there's a mirror somewhere else right...?
10:45:44 <somenerd[m]> slight misunderstanding
10:45:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha, whoops! Sorry somenerd[m]!
10:46:06 <somenerd[m]> yeah I meant mirrors
10:46:11 <somenerd[m]> should've mentioned that lol
10:46:13 * TheJollyRoger blushes
10:46:15 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that XP.
10:46:20 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat "for example there's inherently 1"> Splitting is probably not the problem, the problem is how to sign with the whole key without revealing all the parts to someone, I'd guess
10:46:30 <strcat> also it does no good to have other people to build if you don't have people to make something to build in terms of the availability thing
10:46:31 <strcat> raised earlier
10:46:56 <somenerd[m]> yeah
10:47:16 <somenerd[m]> which is why this would probably happen when the community has a large amount of users and community members
10:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: I think there is a strange (and very messy) way to combine multiple RSA signatures into the same one, but I don't quite remember how to do it, I think the DNSSEC root key does something of the sort but I don't know.
10:47:35 <somenerd[m]> like 20-30 extremely active members
10:47:41 <somenerd[m]> (like mod level active)
10:49:18 <somenerd[m]> multisig seems interesting, but suffers from a problem that you already mentioned before
10:49:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
10:49:58 <somenerd[m]> <somenerd[m] "like 20-30 extremely active memb"> this is probably a needed prerequisite
10:50:11 <somenerd[m]> since the members have to be trusted
10:50:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
10:50:21 <somenerd[m]> (and maybe know AOSP development well)
10:51:51 <TheJollyRoger> T_T. I seem to never have enough computers!
10:52:22 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Relatable
10:52:26 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
10:53:52 <TheJollyRoger> Well, someday, when I have more time and money.
10:54:01 <TheJollyRoger> But for now... I need some more sleep o.O
10:54:39 <TheJollyRoger> G'night, shipmatesh... *hic* or good morning depending on where you are at thish time of the d-day.
10:54:51 <take_a_deep_brea> good night !
10:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> *klunk*
10:54:54 <TheJollyRoger> Zzzzzzz
10:55:13 <somenerd[m]> Good night
10:58:38 <rny> someday in the future, we will have an annual signing ceremony?
10:58:39 <rny> lol
10:58:53 <rny> the grapheneos summit
10:59:27 <somenerd[m]> sounds cool
10:59:45 <somenerd[m]> everyone meets up and signs each other's keys
10:59:50 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
10:59:53 <somenerd[m]> talks about the latest GrapheneOS audit
11:09:05 <stencil[m]> <rny "someday in the future, we will h"> Seems like the most boring ceremony ever
11:09:36 <somenerd[m]> eh
11:09:41 <somenerd[m]> depends on the events
11:09:51 <somenerd[m]> a talk on GrapheneOS may make it decent
11:09:58 <rny> r00d
11:10:22 <somenerd[m]> also do pings work on irc?
11:10:28 <rny> yes, ctcp
11:10:58 <somenerd[m]> cool then
11:11:06 <somenerd[m]>  * a talk on GrapheneOS may make it nice
11:11:14 <somenerd[m]> > a talk on GrapheneOS may make it nice
11:11:14 <somenerd[m]> or maybe some other events
11:11:26 <somenerd[m]> for a future and bigger community though
11:15:14 <stencil[m]> The signing part
11:16:59 <somenerd[m]> yeah makes sense
11:46:24 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <somenerd[m] "everyone meets up and signs each"> What is this? PGP Web Of Trust?
11:46:42 <somenerd[m]> lol
11:46:52 <somenerd[m]> I mean, sorta?
11:47:11 <somenerd[m]> > someday in the future, we will have an annual signing ceremony?
11:47:20 <somenerd[m]> this idea, except extended
11:47:25 <somenerd[m]> sorta

17:45:39 <strcat> GrapheneOS 2021.02.02.09 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.02.02.09
17:45:44 <strcat> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356659919949299712
17:49:40 <adeus[m]> Good morning :)
17:52:18 <adeus[m]> I have a question or feature request. A major concern and limitation with Android devices encryption is the device data is in unlocked state most of the time. User profiles help contain this but a really great mitigation measure would be to allow the admin to set a time that if a user does not authenticate within given time period “x hours” the profile will logout automatically and go to encrypted state. You can then
17:52:19 <adeus[m]> like a security scale set different time limits based on your threat level. For people who understand the limitations of full disk encryption this would be a very welcome improvement to those limitations!
17:53:37 <strcat> adeus[m]: that's an issue with encryption in general, not Android, and please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
17:55:15 <aokiepokie[m]> Very interesting
17:55:43 <aokiepokie[m]> That is actually a really good idea
17:56:59 <adeus[m]> I have read this issue and I see that GrapheneOS makes a lot of improvements on the Android model so I offered this suggestion because the fact is encryption is meaningless on devices that are on 24/7 and I think this solution can harden against some of attacks that take advantage of that
17:57:47 <strcat[m]> it's not meaningless and you seem to misunderstand the implementation
17:57:56 <adeus[m]> <strcat "adeus: that's an issue with encr"> Yes, the problem is a limitation of full disk encryption in general. But in same way the profile feature you i troduced help mitigate this.
17:58:24 <strcat[m]> there's a "dead man's switch" issue filed on the tracker
17:58:28 <strcat[m]> it's not a new idea
17:58:28 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not meaningless and you see"> Sorry my English is not 100% I mean limited in fact it is in decrypted state post first boot authentication
17:58:53 <strcat[m]> adeus: it's not at rest, but it's still encrypted
17:59:10 <strcat[m]> it's never not encrypted
18:00:10 <adeus[m]> I refer to the research published by John Hopkins recently on limitations of full disk encryption on mobile devices and how forensic equipment is able to access it
18:00:26 <adeus[m]> I believe author name is Matt Greene
18:00:32 <strcat[m]> you're referring to research from people who lack an understanding of Android and published inaccurate information on it
18:00:45 <strcat[m]> I suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
18:00:55 <strcat[m]> including the last paragraph
18:01:25 <strcat[m]> a known source of misinformation on Android is not a reliable source of info on how encryption works and what the limitations are
18:01:37 <strcat[m]> we have accurate information available on our site
18:02:13 <strcat[m]> and there's an issue on the tracker filed about a "dead man's switch" feature for a timeout to put data at rest (it was actually filed to say "wipe data" but that's not what we would do as the default mode)
18:02:32 <strcat[m]> it's an existing idea, but ideas are just that, ideas
18:02:36 <strcat[m]> someone has to implement it
18:02:52 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/206
18:03:09 <strcat[m]> I'm sure there was a version filed in ~2015-2016 on the legacy bug tracker
18:06:26 <strcat[m]> adeus: someone who is repeatedly told something but continues to claim a falsehood without ever acknowledging it (multiple falsehoods) isn't an accurate source of info
18:06:42 <strcat[m]> adeus: so, please disregard 'research' that is deliberately overlooking things and presenting false info
18:07:01 <strcat[m]> our site actually accurately describes how it works (in contrast to that) and what the limitations with it are
18:07:42 <strcat[m]> and we also say what the differences are from AOSP so you can see how AOSP works from that too
18:07:44 <strcat[m]> not that much different
18:08:56 <adeus[m]> The paragraph you are referencing is about application level encryption
18:09:54 <adeus[m]> You could implement a feature at the OS level that would not rely on collective motivations wide group of developers to implement app level encryption.
18:10:04 <adeus[m]> This would be ideal solution I agree
18:10:26 <strcat[m]> it's an OS feature supported via hardware
18:10:42 <adeus[m]> But OS level mitigation to help safeguard data when threat level calls for it would be more attainable and realistic
18:10:58 <aokiepokie[m]> I would be willing to donate for this feature!!
18:11:03 <strcat[m]> there's an HSM providing the hardware keystore API to apps including support for requiring that the device is unlocked for a key to be available
18:11:05 <aokiepokie[m]> $500
18:11:09 <adeus[m]> aokiepokie: lol
18:11:10 <strcat[m]> aokiepokie: there's not such thing as donating for a feature
18:11:14 <strcat[m]>  * aokiepokie: there's no such thing as donating for a feature
18:11:32 <strcat[m]> aokiepokie: you can donate to support the project and no service or product is provided in return for donations, that's the definition of a donation
18:11:42 <strcat[m]> it would not be legal to provide a product or service in exchange for a donation
18:11:47 <strcat[m]> that's not a donation
18:11:55 <strcat[m]> that's contract work
18:12:48 <aokiepokie[m]> That makes sense
18:13:23 <strcat[m]> so you could find a developer to pay to implement the dead man's switch feature
18:13:47 <strcat[m]> but I'm not available for that, and GrapheneOS itself doesn't facilitate that kind of thing, it's entirely donation supported
18:14:45 <jakewise[m]> <fatrightbobama[m "Can we bundle the Facebook app w"> Are you serious, or trolling?
18:14:51 <strcat[m]> the only way to donate to support development of a feature is if we ran a fundraising campaign for a specific feature which we're very unlikely to do
18:14:52 <strcat[m]> and then hired someone with that money
18:15:04 <strcat[m]> jakewise: it's just trolling, ignore it
18:16:44 <fatrightbobama[m> It wasn’t trolling, it was a healthy joke as I mentioned immediately afterwards. Jake is as wise a always.
18:18:14 <jakewise[m]> <fatrightbobama[m "It wasn’t trolling, it was a hea"> Didn’t see the follow up. Haha. But I mean, I do hear this kind of stupidity, and far too frequently.
18:19:10 <fatrightbobama[m> XD
18:22:11 <fatrightbobama[m> Sorry If I offended anyone with my zucker humor 😅. BTW. I plan to use Signal. How are the notifications working with the websocket? Reliable? Battery friendly? Pixel 4a
18:22:12 <fatrightbobama[m> Ty
18:33:26 <downdownwithit> hello?
18:45:02 <debbiedoesdallas> anyone here?
18:45:22 <debbiedoesdallas> Do not know if this is working for me or not...
18:46:20 <r0tt0r[m]> welcome
18:46:25 <TheJollyRoger> Hello debbiedoesdallas, what are you having an issue with?
18:46:45 <debbiedoesdallas> Nothing, I just did not see any activity and I was not sure if I was connected to the IRC or not.  Hello!
18:46:51 <debbiedoesdallas> New to IRC.
18:46:52 <TheJollyRoger> fatrightbobama[m: Notifications work, but the app has to support sending notifications without Play Services.
18:47:04 <TheJollyRoger> debbiedoesdallas: well! Welcome aboard the ship, then!
18:47:17 <debbiedoesdallas> Thank you @TheJollyRoger!
18:47:44 <TheJollyRoger> debbiedoesdallas: Usually a lot of people will sign onto the IRC, and then leave it running in the background, then check it when they want to or check it sporadically.
18:48:02 <debbiedoesdallas> Loving Graphene btw.  Put it on a Pixel 3XL.
18:48:11 <debbiedoesdallas> Gotcha.
18:48:27 <TheJollyRoger> So it's pretty typical for the channel to have "flurries" of chatting activity, and then go through "lulls" occasionally, rather than there being a constant stream of banter going back and forth.
18:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! Glad to hear you're finding the software useful!
18:48:43 <strcat> also if someone asks a question important for them to wait a while for someone to answer
18:48:45 <strcat> might take an hour
18:48:52 <strcat> instead of asking, waiting a minute and leaving
18:49:24 <debbiedoesdallas> Sent Daniel some BTC!  Fantastic project.
18:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Even though there might be a lot of people here, most of them like to idle and then catch up on scrollback later.
18:49:49 <TheJollyRoger> debbiedoesdallas: On behalf of the project, that's greatly appreciated, you rock!
18:50:14 <debbiedoesdallas> I wish I could contribute more, but my treasure is all I can offer...
18:50:40 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, well look after yourself too.
19:05:45 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> hey guys. i just finished flashing grapheneOs on my new pixel phone. I'm glad i now have the most secure mobile OS
19:06:39 <TheJollyRoger> hdjudubebbdj[m]: Yarr, welcome aboard the ship!
19:06:51 <r0tt0r[m]> <hdjudubebbdj[m] "hey guys. i just finished flashi"> congrats and welcome
19:07:45 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> thank you. i used lineageOs before but then i read it's insecure because of the unlocked bootloader
19:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, this is definitely the case.
19:08:03 <debbiedoesdallas> Is it normal for the messaging app to have the 'old version prompt'?
19:08:32 <TheJollyRoger> debbiedoesdallas: for now, yes. The Messaging app in GrapheneOS is an older version from upstream. A good drop-in replacement for it is Signal.
19:08:58 <mhnoyes> TheJollyRoger: Does Element work?
19:09:10 <debbiedoesdallas> Yes, that is what I am using.
19:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> mhnoyes: Element has been confirmed to work on GrapheneOS -- ha, and there you go! :)
19:09:20 <mhnoyes> debbiedoesdallas: Thanks.
19:09:31 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> it's so great not to have all those unnecessary spy apps from google on your phone anymore xD
19:09:31 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> btw i mostly use telegram and signal for messaging. which other messenger apps would you guys recommend that's privacy friendly?
19:09:32 <debbiedoesdallas> mhoyes ... have you tried session messenger as well?  works OK.
19:09:51 <TheJollyRoger> hdjudubebbdj[m]: Right now generally the go-to is Signal.
19:10:13 <mhnoyes> debbiedoesdallas: I haven't installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3 yet.
19:10:39 <TheJollyRoger> mhnoyes: Hehe, you'll be able to use the new web install!
19:11:11 <debbiedoesdallas> mhoyes ... gotcha.  I put it on a 3xl a few days ago.  It was very easy and seamless following the directions for command line on Ubuntu
19:11:34 <mhnoyes> debbiedoesdallas: Debian user here.
19:11:40 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> me too
19:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> mhnoyes: Before you begin, make sure you've exported your contact list and any photos, videos, backed up your 2FA Authenticator tokens, etc. Anything you do not want to lose.
19:12:08 <mhnoyes> TheJollyRoger: Thanks for the suggestion.
19:12:36 <debbiedoesdallas> Anyone here using Session Messenger?
19:12:55 <TheJollyRoger> If you're already using Signal, use the backup function, so you can save your contacts and safety numbers offline.
19:13:57 <TheJollyRoger> debbiedoesdallas: I think a few people have been, although you might have better luck with the inquiry over at #grapheneos-offtopic , there's more discussion along instant messaging apps and such there, when the channel begins to warm up.
19:14:17 <debbiedoesdallas> Thanks @thejollyroger
19:14:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, anytime!
19:14:47 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> <debbiedoesdallas "Anyone here using Session Messen"> yes i have it installed
19:15:15 <debbiedoesdallas> I will drop in later.  Thanks again any dev's out there!  More BTC will be flowing your way.
19:15:30 <TheJollyRoger> debbiedoesdallas: You rock! Thank you in advance, see you soon.
19:17:30 <mhnoyes> TheJollyRoger: Speaking of 2FA, what are people using instead of Google Authenticator?
19:17:44 <hdjudubebbdj[m]> <mhnoyes "TheJollyRoger: Speaking of 2FA, "> i use aegis
19:17:57 * mhnoyes looks
19:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> mhnoyes: Some have also had good luck with FreeOTP.
19:18:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I am also using Aegis
19:18:56 <TheJollyRoger> Sounds like Aegis is the way to go then :)
19:18:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And there's also AndOTP
19:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, wow, sure are a lot of them!
19:19:18 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> You could also use some KeePass client
19:19:23 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Maybe KeePassDX
19:19:27 <mhnoyes> Thanks everyone, I only use software based 2FA when Yubikey isn't supported.
19:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, makes sense.
19:19:48 <mhnoyes> SkyFox [kde.org]: I use KeypassX daily.
19:19:56 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> 👍️
19:20:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> The andOTP developer recommends using Aegis as well. Not sure if that position has changed though.
19:20:11 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I use KeePassDX on Android
19:20:38 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I am considering moving to 1Password, though
19:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> Right now NFC does work on GrapheneOS, but there is a catch: U2F/WebAuth on Android for some reason depends on a Play Services library, which we don't have, hopefully in the future someone will be able to send in that lib.
19:22:40 <mhnoyes> <mhnoyes "SkyFox [kde.org]: I use KeypassX"> Correction KeePassXC
19:23:14 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yeah, I am also using that one on desktop
19:23:22 <TheJollyRoger> Same here.
19:24:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys - for discussing apps and such, you might have better luck over at #grapheneos-offtopic, might want to head over there for the time being for password managers and 2FA apps.
19:27:04 <randomfreespeech> I tried GrapheneOS a few months ago but notifications didn't want to work (for any app). Is this a known issue or a feature? Pixel 3XL.
19:28:55 <strcat> notifications work fine
19:29:06 <Lupita[m]> I had issues only with apps that relied on Google's Messaging Service, which ofc isn't included in graphene
19:29:17 <strcat> some apps use FCM for push, others support alternatives to it
19:29:21 <strcat> but notifications themselves work fine
19:29:27 <strcat> no issues
19:29:50 <strcat> GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services / FCM ofc, just like AOSP
19:31:19 <TheJollyRoger> randomfreespeech: Likely those notifications are dependent on Play services. Protonmail's app, for instance, I've heard does not display notifications unless you open the app, because they run the app in the background where it can hibernate (so as to not use battery power), then rely on Play services to tell the app to "wake up".
19:31:53 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: rather, they *don't* run the app in the bg
19:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, ah whoop, sorry.
19:32:07 <strcat> an app implementing their own push keeps open a TCP connection to their own server
19:32:25 <strcat> and then when the server has new data available it pushes a notice (or the data itself)
19:32:42 <strcat> lots of protocol have this such as IMAP IDLE for IMAP
19:32:57 <strcat> FCM just outsources the whole thing to Google
19:33:04 <TheJollyRoger> Oh I see.
19:33:08 <strcat> Play services keeps open a connection to Google's FCM servers
19:33:12 <randomfreespeech> Yes PM was one of them for me. Thanks for the prompt help!
19:33:23 <strcat> and the app developer has to have their server send a message to Google's server
19:33:36 <strcat> randomfreespeech: that app is choosing to send notifications via Google
19:33:46 <strcat> randomfreespeech: without implementing an alternative
19:34:10 <strcat> there are mail apps implementing push via IMAP IDLE (many just do polling, but there are plenty with proper push)
19:34:15 * m2tu[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xLBduLNjZYTcFFvxSjgPurFm/message.txt >
19:34:57 <m2tu[m]> can this be fault with the scrpt tring to read /etc/
19:35:25 <m2tu[m]> because i dont see anyy build.prop etc folders in the release graphene system?
19:36:15 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: oh huh.
19:36:23 <strcat[m]> m2tu:  not clear what you're trying to do and what you think is an issue
19:37:01 <m2tu[m]> i did the last command script/release.sh blueline
19:37:15 <m2tu[m]> building .. and i got this errors
19:37:17 <strcat[m]> it
19:37:21 <strcat[m]> it's not an issue then
19:37:30 <strcat[m]> those aren't errors
19:38:01 <m2tu[m]> ah ok i wiat until finish then  . thanks for answer
19:53:36 <Aviators> hi
19:53:44 <Aviators> I own a google pixel 4, I would like to know if I install Graphene OS, is there any way to install google services and also playstore? Some work apps take advantage of these systems.
19:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Aviators, google services and Play Store can't really be used on GrapheneOS, Play Services require deep integration with the operating system.
19:55:25 <TheJollyRoger> Since we consider some aspects of Play Services to be invasive, we don't bundle it.
19:55:30 <Aviators> ok. thanks.
19:56:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If I recall correctly it needs to be integrated into the operating system, and it can't simply be "strapped on" afterward.
19:56:52 <Kurai> Aviators: keep an eye on https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/50
19:57:39 <Aviators> Thanks ;)
19:57:42 <Aviators> i read ;)
20:07:12 <strcat[m]> Kurai: microG is a very small subset of Play services, it will only make some apps work and they may not keep working
20:07:18 <strcat[m]> and that PR isn't going to merged as is
20:07:33 <strcat[m]> we would have to make a fork of microG and our own builds of that
20:07:41 <strcat[m]> and it's certainly not going to be bundled with the OS
20:07:46 <strcat[m]> suggest reading what has been written about it
20:08:20 <strcat[m]> it's a side project and a low priority - we have much higher priorities, and the other approach we give to compatibility with a broader range of apps choosing not to support Android (but rather just supporting Android + Play services) is preferred
20:08:48 <strcat[m]> i.e. the plans for the option to install a stub implementation of Play services in a profile which pretends the services are unavailable
20:08:56 <strcat[m]> that is our preferred approach and what we're going to focus on, I think
20:09:04 <strcat[m]> and regardless
20:09:12 <strcat[m]> the focus is on apps from developers supporting the platform
20:09:26 <strcat[m]> not apps requiring hacks which are always going to be at risk of breaking at any time as they adopt new APIs etc
20:09:34 <h3rb_> Hi. Does GrapheneOS have Vowifi? After the last update I see that VoLTE is working.
20:09:35 <strcat[m]> if it's not clear, none of this is ever going to be built in
20:09:44 <strcat[m]> h3rb_: yes, it does
20:10:00 <strcat[m]> perhaps your carrier doesn't support it without bloatware apps
20:10:23 <strcat[m]> VoLTE worked fine prior to the previous update
20:10:41 <h3rb_> Ahh I understand. So if it not natively support will my carrier help me get that functionality?
20:10:51 <strcat[m]> the previous update just added more carrier specific configurations working around their broken implementations
20:10:52 <h3rb_> Supported*
20:11:08 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS has native support for VoWiFi and VoLTE and it isn't a recent thing
20:11:17 <strcat[m]> carriers don't follow the standards
20:11:20 <h3rb_> Yes for me it just started after the previous update
20:11:38 <strcat[m]> because your carrier has a broken implementation that had to be worked around
20:11:39 <strcat[m]> it worked before the last update
20:11:55 <h3rb_> How do I work around this for vowifi?
20:12:09 <h3rb_> Because it looks like that option is not working for me
20:12:13 <strcat[m]> you don't, your carrier probably requires a bloatware app to be built into the OS as a privileged app
20:12:21 <strcat[m]> we're not doing that
20:12:24 <strcat[m]> switch carriers
20:12:39 <strcat[m]> contact them about it
20:12:44 <h3rb_> Ok I understand
20:12:52 <h3rb_> Thank you.
20:13:06 <strcat> most US carriers require a proprietary app to do VoWiFi
20:13:18 <strcat> should work fine with most other carriers around the world now if they support it properly
20:13:37 <h3rb_> I ll find out from my carrier if there is an app that can help me use vowifi
20:17:26 <strcat[m]> there won't be, it would have to be built into the OS
20:17:49 <h3rb_> Strcat I just spoke with them and they said vowifi calling will work directly there is no app that needs to be configured. The options for vowifi is in settings but I was not able to find that option
20:18:31 <strcat[m]> which carrier
20:18:42 <h3rb_> Airtel Indian carrier
20:18:44 <strcat[m]> h3rb_: their support people are unlikely to know what's required
20:19:42 <strcat[m]> I think you're misunderstanding what I've said
20:19:43 <strcat[m]> suggest going back and reading it again
20:19:44 <strcat[m]> I never suggested that there would be an app that needs to be installed
20:20:22 <strcat[m]> I don't think there's anything else to cover on this topic
20:20:53 <h3rb_> Ok got it. Thank you for your time.
20:20:53 <strcat[m]> if a carrier has working VoWiFi without stuff like Google's activation app, it will work now
20:21:04 <strcat[m]> many require stuff like that
20:21:06 <strcat[m]> so it won't work
20:21:27 <h3rb_> Got it.
20:21:32 <strcat[m]> it's not an app that you can install, it's an app that would have to be built into the OS, and isn't, we don't ship Google Play services and Google apps, including Google's carrier support apps
20:21:40 <strcat[m]> many carriers choose not to follow the standards
20:21:49 <strcat[m]> and choose to depend on Google apps / services for stuff like that
20:22:05 <strcat[m]> (some depend on Google services in a way that follows standards and works without special apps, etc. though)
20:23:14 <h3rb_> Ok got it thanks for the explanation.
20:24:39 <strcat[m]> I think we do need some kinds of settings overlays to expose more configuration but if they supported VoWiFi that worked out of the box it'd already work fine
20:24:45 <strcat[m]> you just might not have a toggle to disable it atm
20:24:56 <strcat[m]> due to lack of some carrier-specific configuration options
20:25:13 <strcat[m]> unlikely that would help you with anything
20:29:46 <h3rb_> Ok yes when I also do a *#*#4636#*#* ut says that wifi calling provisioned option is powered off and greyed out
20:55:45 <m2tu[m]> Succeded with the build and sucessfully installed+locket bootloader.
20:55:58 <m2tu[m]> now i wonder if i rmove or add some apps.
20:56:13 <m2tu[m]> shall i do some special command bfor i rebuild ?
20:56:51 <m2tu[m]> or i just do delete the directors from out tagert folder the ones i rmove from mk fles ?
21:10:19 <jcb[m]> Error when pressing the camera icon in Jami's chat: "Error taking picture: No Activity found to handle Intent { act=android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE flg=0x3 clip={text/uri-list {...}} (has extars) }." Any ideas of the problem and a possible solution?

22:04:52 <niky> hello everyone
22:05:21 <niky> i just installed aurora store and its not working
22:05:44 <niky> i did try that token custom from the network settings
22:05:52 <niky> but its still not working
22:06:02 <niky> i even tried reinstalling the app
22:06:39 <niky> Also i asked for help in off topic but didnt get any response so looking for help here
22:08:17 <kalbasit[m]> strcat: just came back from PTO and catching up to the story with Copperhead (I believe that's the company that was supporting the project at some point, right?)
22:08:28 <kalbasit[m]> strcat: where/how can I pitch in some cash?
22:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> hello kalbasit[m], that's awesome to hear you're interested in pitching in! We really appreciate it, GrapheneOS has a donation page available, at https://grapheneos.org/donate . Recurring monthly donations are best set up through GitHub, or one-time donations can be sent via PayPal, or if you prefer to be a bit more anonymous you can use Bitcoin or Monero there.
22:13:13 <kalbasit[m]> TheJollyRoger: I setup monthly through GitHub. It's not much but I hope it helps...
22:13:39 <grapheneos_user_> kalbasit: to add to what jolly Roger said, even if you want to make a one time donation you could break it up over a couple months and do github sponsors
22:13:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hello niky, right now I think Aurora's Tokenizer might be broken, not sure if it's fixed on their end yet.
22:13:57 <grapheneos_user_> Gothub matches donations so projects get twice the money
22:14:04 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit[m]: You rock! On behalf of the project, we really appreciate it, every buck counts!
22:14:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, right now the Github Sponsorship has ended, they're no longer matching donations since it ended, BUT! we were able to get a good run out of it though!
22:14:44 <kalbasit[m]> TheJollyRoger: absolutely. Spreading the word as well hopefully more people support you. This project is awesome!
22:14:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, I'll drink to that, shipmate!
22:15:12 <niky> is there any alternative to aurora store, i really need whatsapp and zoom asap
22:15:17 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Ah, right now the Github Sponsor"> I see, maybe if it starts again we can post on social media about that
22:16:20 <TheJollyRoger> niky: you're in luck! Zoom actually has a web release apk for people who don't have Google Play. It's tested and working on GrapheneOS.
22:16:27 <TheJollyRoger> It should be available on their website.
22:17:03 <TheJollyRoger> As for WhatsApp... I'm not sure where to get it at the moment, short of third-party APK mirroring sites.
22:17:11 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "niky: you're in luck! Zoom actua"> Just out of curiosity, is it possible to build GrapheneOS with Gplay services?
22:17:54 <grapheneos_user_> If you need security but are willing to give up privacy if you need Google play apps
22:17:57 <niky> Okay so is the problem that im facing with aurora store not only with me?
22:18:02 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: In theory, it would be, but it would require deep integration with the operating system, and you'd likely have to know and be able to do some amount of coding.
22:18:22 <TheJollyRoger> niky: no, it's not just you; Aurora Store is somewhat unreliable at times. It occasionally breaks.
22:18:53 <niky> should i use my google acc and login in?
22:19:04 <niky> will that make a difference?
22:19:13 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "grapheneos_user_pi: In theory, i"> OK, so its possible but difficult. Maybe I can try it and see if it works, using AOSP as a guide. Thanks
22:19:25 <TheJollyRoger> niky: I honestly don't know, sorry. Using Aurora Store isn't officially allowed by Google, they might frown on that.
22:19:57 <niky> is there any alternative to aurora store?
22:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: good luck! Please keep us updated; even if Google Play won't ever be supported in GrapheneOS, having that knowledge would come in handy for stuff further down the road.
22:20:00 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <TheJollyRoger "niky: I honestly don't know, sor"> Yeah, afaik, they might block the account
22:20:23 <mynacol[m]> niky: You should be able to download the WhatsApp apk from their website https://www.whatsapp.com/android/
22:20:38 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: oh yikes that's pretty terrifying.
22:20:44 <TheJollyRoger> mynacol[m]: whew, APK to the rescue!
22:21:59 <mynacol[m]> It's hidden, they mostly want to send you to the play store...
22:22:30 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense... generally we want to avoid normalizing sideloading, especially for the majority of users.
22:23:58 <niky> can anyone send a download link for zoom just like mynacol[m] sent for  whatsapp
22:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec.
22:25:57 <TheJollyRoger> I don't use Zoom, but I looked up their APK for reference, let me see if it's still here.
22:26:34 <niky> i couldnt find it and their sites was redirecting to play store
22:26:54 <niky> so an apk would be great
22:27:32 <TheJollyRoger> They might've removed it.
22:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> :(
22:28:22 <niky> :(
22:28:48 <niky> any alternative to aurora store?
22:29:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, looks like my old bookmark's directing to an empty page.
22:29:11 <blk> https://zoom.us/download?os=android
22:29:45 <TheJollyRoger> Oh hell. blk, you are zoomsaver. Thanks.
22:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> XP.
22:30:33 <blk> :-P
22:30:37 <grayhatter> running zoom on graphene... isn't that like installing a screen door on a sub?
22:30:53 <TheJollyRoger> grayhatter: yes :P.
22:30:54 <blk> LOL. yes
22:31:10 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
22:32:30 <niky> Thank you mynacol[m], TheJollyRoger, blk
22:34:31 <blk> Actually if I had to run Zoom, Graphene would probably be my best option.
22:34:43 <blk> makes it very easy to sandbox
22:34:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Denying permissions when not in use, and all.
22:40:30 <TheJollyRoger> Still, I do find it kinda funny :p.
22:41:58 <b1101> waiting for the new update ota :)
22:43:43 <kalbasit[m]> <kalbasit[m] "TheJollyRoger: absolutely. Sprea"> https://twitter.com/kalbasit/status/1356734837126651905 please RT
22:44:02 <m2tu[m]> I did installed a build by m self
22:44:25 <m2tu[m]> and now i try auditor , it says invalid verified boot fingerprint ?
22:44:50 <m2tu[m]> auditor app works only with release version?
22:45:10 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit[m]: Awesome, thank you for the tweet! \o/
22:45:12 <grapheneos_user_> <kalbasit[m] "https://twitter.com/kalbasit/sta"> Just remember, there are going to be a lot of copperhead trolls in your post. Do be aware of that.
22:46:03 <grapheneos_user_> So if people that reply and like/retweet it also look for copperhead trolls, that would be great
22:46:11 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: It's because now you're no longer running GrapheneOS or the Google OS, you're running your own version of the OS. Remember that each instance of grapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical.
22:46:21 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: did you also comment out or change the URL of the update server?
22:47:15 <m2tu[m]> i comented out the update server
22:47:36 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: whew, thanks.
22:47:37 <kalbasit[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "Just remember, there are going t"> https://media.giphy.com/media/vEcyRJ5yysqk/giphy.gif 😃
22:47:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hoho
22:47:58 <m2tu[m]> allright, can i add my fingerprint to auditor in some way? or that just for release only
22:49:10 <m2tu[m]> i will go back to realease version of course...  i do think release much more safer .. i just love making expriments and learn about coding.
22:50:27 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: For now you'll be on your own, for that. You're going to have to fork Auditor and AttestationServer and maintain those in parallel. If you do, please send any new features or maintenance you add upstream, and that could be merged, but at this moment it's likely that you'll want to get properly set up to release full production images, for Auditor to merge your keys.
22:50:53 <grapheneos_user_> kalbasit: https://giphy.com/gifs/pawsr-cat-running-towards-camera-f9RuFaYaZO9OZ3qLjZ
22:52:28 <m2tu[m]> aha i see what u mean :))) well that will be some bit overkill i think :)
22:53:00 <m2tu[m]> anhow , auditor is mostly made to chekc for temperng
22:53:24 <m2tu[m]> i mean if anyone load a spyapp on my device auditor will not recinize that anyhow ?
22:53:37 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> guys, every time i restart my pixel phone i get the message that i have a different ROM installed. the message only goes away when i press volume up or down and then it boots. is this normal?
22:54:02 <m2tu[m]> did u locked bootloader ?
22:54:06 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> yes
22:54:21 <m2tu[m]> ther eis a message allways on google phones
22:54:32 <m2tu[m]> thats nothing to care about
22:54:36 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> so it's normal? ok thx
22:54:51 <TheJollyRoger> jdiidiebhdukdkks: Yes, seeing the yellow screen "Your device is loading a different operating system" is normal and expected behaviour.
22:55:12 <TheJollyRoger> It's good, it means the verified boot is on and enforcing, and you are loading an operating system that's not Google's.
22:55:18 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> <TheJollyRoger "jdiidiebhdukdkks: Yes, seeing th"> thank you
22:56:03 <TheJollyRoger> Only if it turns orange and says something like "Software integrity is not guaranteed, bootloader is unlocked" do you need to worry. If that happens, it means the bootloader is unlocked and many of your phone's hardware security features (and all software security features that then depend on them) have been switched off.
22:56:35 <TheJollyRoger> jdiidiebhdukdkks: to prevent it from being switched off, you should switch off OEM unlocking in Developer now that you have finished installation.
23:00:48 <m2tu[m]> anyone knows whats diffrence from copperhead and graphene ?
23:01:18 <grayhatter> m2tu[m]: I think there's a comparison on the website isn't there?
23:01:27 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: Copperhead is simply stealing and reselling previous work from way back when Graphene was partnered with them.
23:01:37 <m2tu[m]> i know they steal code from Gr and becomae enemys because they are Mony focused
23:01:56 <m2tu[m]> so the have nothing more to give than graphene os
23:02:00 <grayhatter> I'm not sure you can fairly say it's stealing
23:02:02 <m2tu[m]> just tke money?
23:02:11 <m2tu[m]> Firewall & network hardening
23:02:15 <m2tu[m]> i seen this in ther web
23:02:18 <TheJollyRoger> Old, outdated code done by outsourcement, months of missing security patches...
23:02:27 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: it's puffery.
23:02:36 <m2tu[m]> ouchh
23:03:02 <m2tu[m]> i hope ppl realize who they are
23:03:19 <TheJollyRoger> I hope so too.
23:03:46 <m2tu[m]> I wish one more thing :)))))
23:04:01 <m2tu[m]> That grapheneoS had its own crpto coin aswell

23:07:20 <TheJollyRoger> We'll continue with Bitcoin and Monero. I personally don't really see a need for us to roll our own when that's more code to maintain, and more to attend to, for very little gain.
23:08:36 <m2tu[m]> I did not known they had it .

23:44:22 <MrPenguin> Hello, I'm currently in what seems to be in a pickle of a situation. I've just received my Pixel 4a, did all the updates on it. Then followed the WEB guide from the website, installed the latest sunfish version (2021.01.23.03) and I got an error in the webpage saying "undefined" and now things are going a-wire.
23:44:57 <MrPenguin> I can't reboot my device, it says no working OS. I've been able to reach the GrapheneOS Recovery screen and I'm not sure what to do from here :/
23:45:13 <MrPenguin> My bootloader is unblocked, any help is appreciated!
23:51:17 <badactor[m]> MrPenguin: I had the same problem because I unplugged my cable too early
23:52:33 <MrPenguin> Very interesting, I'm confident that I didn't unplug my device. Additionally, I have USB-C to USB-c directly from my computer. I read in the FAQ that bad quality cable or back port may cause issue, but to the best of my ability that doesn't seem to be the problem here... badactor[m] what have you done to fix it?
23:53:57 <badactor[m]> I originally followed a youtube guide and that was a mistake
23:54:27 <badactor[m]> I went back and followed the official way to do it from the grapheneos website
