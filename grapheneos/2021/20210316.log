00:35:47 <AndroUser2> Hello all. I heared first time for grapheneOS few days ago and I am first time here. It's verry nice to see many members here, hope you are not all bots. :)
00:36:01 <ultimateextras[m> Welp, I'm not.
00:36:28 <AndroUser2> Nice to hear that. Hello from Serbia! üñêüôÇ
00:37:10 <AndroUser2> I have one question: will some open source xmpp chat client work on graphene os?
00:37:36 <AndroUser2> Anybody test that? Anybody think about that?
00:39:05 <louipc> AndroUser2: yes. conversations should work at least
00:39:34 <AndroUser2> Great, thank you!
00:39:35 <louipc> please join #grapheneos-offtopic for more chat about apps
00:40:27 <AndroUser2> One more question, please: anybody test graphene on some other devices or it just work well od pixel?
00:40:39 <AndroUser2> * on
00:40:42 <louipc> only pixel
00:41:07 <louipc> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
00:41:21 <AndroUser2> Why only pixel? Why they are so special? They are from Google. We can trust them?
00:41:54 <louipc> AndroUser2: please read the FAQ
00:42:18 <Rhinos> Hello, which settings in netguard must be enabled/unblocked to become ota Updates for my Pixel 4a?
00:42:20 <AndroUser2> Ok. Thank you once again! Regards. üí™
02:36:53 <timetravelingman> <Rhinos "Hello, which settings in netguar"> You'd have to figure it out or ask the Netguard devs, GOS has nothing to do with Netguard
02:38:32 <timetravelingman> If I had to take a guess, it would have something to do with not restricting the package seamless update client
02:39:33 <Jim[m]1> GrapheneOS-Teleg: any ways to hide navbar and status bar?
02:40:13 <timetravelingman> Not the status bar, but you can use gesture navigation
02:40:47 <timetravelingman> Basically hides most of what would be considered a navbar
02:40:57 <Jim[m]1> Just avoid screen from burn in
02:41:07 <timetravelingman> Which pixel?
02:41:14 <Jim[m]1> 3a
02:41:19 <timetravelingman> Shouldn't be a problem on more recent ones
02:41:21 <timetravelingman> Ah yeah
02:41:24 <timetravelingman> Fair enough
02:42:58 <timetravelingman> Honestly at this point with the 3a not getting security updates for a great deal longer, I would just try and upgrade if you could
02:44:14 <timetravelingman> A good 8 months left
02:45:17 <timetravelingman> Actually its a year and two months, my bad
02:46:15 <Jim[m]1> Yeah   Consider getting 4a or 5a next yearüòç
03:15:43 <Mush> hey friends
03:16:17 <Mush> need some help. I just installed GrapheneOS and i'm not getting notifications for texts over verizon network. Is there a solution?
03:29:27 <whaddyahear> Does anyone know how to increase the night light/ blue light dimming function? Available apps all require root as far as Ibcan teoo
03:29:47 <whaddyahear> I can tell*
03:30:07 <strcat[m]> Mush: on the owner profile or a secondary one?
03:30:18 <whaddyahear> Owner
03:30:41 <strcat[m]> was in response to Mush not to you
03:31:01 <Mush> Owner Profile I suppose I don't know how to check that
03:31:02 <strcat[m]> whaddyahear: you mean beyond what the intensity setting in the Settings app provides for night light?
03:31:13 <whaddyahear> I see now, sorry about that
03:31:25 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend against using an app-based implementation... they depend on being an accessibility service and drastically reduce security
03:31:34 <strcat[m]> also a lot of performance overhead compared to the hardware implementation
03:32:01 <Mush> it's the default app that grapheneOS came with for messaging
03:33:00 <Mush> is there a reccommendation for an app that can recieve messages from users whaddyahear
03:33:03 <whaddyahear> Strcat yes that is what I mean
03:33:16 <Mush> sorry strcat i mean
03:33:36 <strcat[m]> Mush: the default app works fine
03:33:51 <strcat[m]> Mush: not sure what problem you are having but sounds more like a carrier issue than an OS or app one
03:34:17 <strcat[m]> SMS obviously works fine for the vast majority of people...
03:34:18 <Mush> I use threema but it can only text other users who are on the same network. I should be getting messages then. However, I am on Verizon, so I don't know if they have to enable a setting in their system for the OS.
03:34:42 <strcat[m]> Mush: are you sure your number doesn't have RCS or iMessage enabled?
03:34:42 <Mush> they had to do that for my Razer Phone 2
03:34:54 <strcat[m]> Mush: people can send you SMS just fine
03:34:58 <strcat[m]> no need to change anything on either end
03:35:06 <strcat[m]> again, it's extremely unclear what issue you're actually having
03:35:07 <Mush> the sim was never used in an iPhone
03:35:11 <strcat[m]> you need to start over and explain it better
03:35:17 <Mush> i'm sorry i'm very distracted
03:35:23 <strcat[m]> SMS works fine on GrapheneOS
03:35:27 <Mush> i'll explain again in one second
03:35:36 <strcat[m]> the default app works fine, it just isn't a nice app
03:40:55 <Mush> 1. I moved my sim from my old phone which received notifications and when I installed GrapheneOS onto the new Pixel 4 XL, I cannot recieve messages, only send messages SMS.
03:40:56 <Mush> 2. Battery saver is off
03:40:56 <Mush> 3. It is a verizon Network unlocked phone.
03:40:57 <Mush> 4. I am using the default application.
03:40:57 <Mush> 5. My best guess is that I need to contact my carrier and see if they can fix it. Don't you think strcat
03:41:32 <Mush> *moved my sim to my new pixel 4a when it had GrapheneOS installed
03:41:56 <strcat[m]> okay so it's not about notifications but rather receiving messages at all
03:42:02 <Mush> yes
03:42:08 <strcat[m]> Mush: it sounds like you must have RCS or iMessage enabled for the number
03:42:10 <strcat[m]> probably RCS
03:42:14 <strcat[m]> since you say no iPhone
03:42:24 <strcat[m]> Mush: definitely something you should take up with your carrier
03:42:26 <Mush> Yeah, the only way to disable that is to call them I think
03:42:38 <Mush> When I had a Razer Phone 2 they had to enable that setting I think
03:43:09 <Mush> but it did not affect my previous phone of which I switched my razer phone 2 to, my samsung Galaxy A50
03:43:19 <Mush> strcat
03:43:26 <strcat[m]> well, it sounds like a strange carrier-specific problem
03:43:29 <strcat[m]> Verizon is a problematic carrier
03:43:59 <strcat[m]> I recommend switching to T-Mobile if you want everything to work on an OS without a partnership with the carrier and bundled carrier apps from them
03:44:35 <Mush> I don't think I get tmobile in my area, I live in a rural area.
03:44:38 <Mush> i'll look into it
03:44:47 <Mush> strcat thank you for your help
03:45:45 <strcat[m]> Mush: anything is better than Verizon / Verizon MVNOs
03:46:17 <strcat[m]> T-Mobile seems to be the least bad US carrier (and MVNOs based on it mostly seem fine too)
03:46:53 <KanYe[m]> How is mint mobile for Graphene OS ? It‚Äôs is a T-Mobile based and seem like a pretty good deal on paper.
03:50:03 <strcat[m]> KanYe: think it works well
03:51:45 <BitcoinComics[m]> is there any good options for phone carriers in Canada?
03:52:29 <louipc> not really. but thats a topic better discussed in #grapheneos-offtopic
03:54:02 <tomzion[m]> Hi, is it possible to have a cryptocurrencies Wallet up-to-date on GrapheneOS?
04:05:33 <strcat> tomzion[m]: sure, why not?
04:06:11 <somenerd[m]> I mean, which part is the question?
04:06:17 <somenerd[m]> getting a wallet?
04:06:22 <somenerd[m]> or keeping it up to date
04:06:30 <somenerd[m]> believe that both are possible
04:06:33 <somenerd[m]>  * or keeping it up to date?
04:06:42 <tomzion[m]> both
04:06:55 <somenerd[m]> can't recommend any specific wallet, but I believe you can
04:09:11 <rny> if you're receiving the cold shoulder, its likely that your question/what you're talking about belongs in #grapheneos-offtopic
04:09:21 <somenerd[m]>  * can't recommend any specific wallet (since I haven't used any), but I believe you can
04:09:46 <tomzion[m]> <rny "if you're receiving the cold sho"> ok thanks
04:09:53 <rny> cryptocurrency wallets are offtopic in #grapheneos
04:10:29 <somenerd[m]> I mean, the only thing on-topic for this room is GrapheneOS lol
04:13:24 <Mush> need some help getting my ICCID number
04:13:38 <Mush> do you guys know how to do this on Graphene?
04:15:38 <Mush> I found it
04:37:25 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> is it possible to use discord on graphene? I'm trying to join a room and it won't let me. I tried vanadium and bromite
04:38:09 <strcat[m]> sure, think it works fine
04:44:15 <jciferno[m]> Does anyone have an good feed back for backing up the phone's entirety? I was looking into TWRP but graphene doesn't have it enabled.
04:47:01 <TheJollyRoger> jciferno[m]: you can use seedvault to back up the apps in your owner profile, and then copy the contents of the shared storage to your computer via USB (Media Transfer Protocol).
04:48:37 <TheJollyRoger> Or, you can buy one of those USB SSDs and then transfer your stuff to it.
04:49:32 <somenerd[m]> I believe that seedvault doesn't backup the home directory
04:49:46 <somenerd[m]> > then copy the contents of the shared storage to your computer via USB (Media Transfer Protocol).
04:50:02 <somenerd[m]> so you have to do this in order to back the home directory
04:50:53 <strcat> you can back it up another way
04:50:59 <strcat> like copying it with the file manager to the USB drive
04:51:11 <somenerd[m]> yeah
04:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it doesn't back up the shared storage, you'll have to do that yourself. It just backs up the apps, the contact lists, and the app data for apps that opt-in to allow backups.
04:51:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:51:21 <strcat> it will be adding support for that though
04:51:27 <TheJollyRoger> Whew, that's good to hear!
04:51:52 <TheJollyRoger> I've been hoping that in the far future there would be a "tarsnap" for mobile, and it sounds like seedvault is moving in that direction.
04:51:59 <somenerd[m]> would be cool if there was an app to upgrade GrapheneOS to another phone
04:52:25 <somenerd[m]> (like an app to install GrapheneOS to another Pixel, verifying the signature)
04:52:46 <TheJollyRoger> Well... the web installer can install GrapheneOS from GrapheneOS...
04:53:45 <somenerd[m]> > Well... the web installer can install GrapheneOS from GrapheneOS...
04:53:45 <somenerd[m]> yeah, don't think that the signature is verified though
04:53:52 <TheJollyRoger> So in theory, let's say September comes around and your Pixel 3 is about to go EOL but you just got a shiny new Pixel 5, you could plug the two phones in together, then use the 3 to install GrapheneOS to it...
04:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> Well, then you use Auditor afterward.
04:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> And do local verification using the QR codes.
04:54:23 <sjsndnjdejd> <p8tuahpirua5ra[m "is it possible to use discord on"> Just download the app
04:54:25 <TheJollyRoger> Once you've got that you're in the clear.
04:54:29 <somenerd[m]> > And do local verification using the QR codes.
04:54:29 <somenerd[m]> actually that may work
04:54:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:54:43 <somenerd[m]> > Once you've got that you're in the clear.
04:54:43 <somenerd[m]> and seedvault to use a backup
04:54:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:55:22 <TheJollyRoger> It's a tad bit hinky, but it's doable.
04:55:31 <jciferno[m]> somenerd: strcat TheJollyRoger: so when backing up by either copying the home directory or using seed vault, does it back up the general settings and apps for each of the users?
04:55:53 <TheJollyRoger> If I figure out how to make a darn app I should work on that...
04:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> jciferno[m]: at the moment, unfortunately seedvault doesn't back up other profiles, only the owner profile. We're hoping that upstream will address this in the future.
04:56:30 <somenerd[m]> would be cool if this whole process (verifying with auditor, backing up, installing) could be done with one app
04:56:49 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: yeah, like a "Migrate GrapheneOS forward" app?
04:56:54 <somenerd[m]> yeah
04:57:15 <somenerd[m]> "Upgrade" app, I guess?
04:57:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
04:57:49 <TheJollyRoger> Right now I'm taking my first forays into writing an app... so far progress is damn slow though.
04:58:26 <jciferno[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you for the clarification, Is there a potential solution for copying the entirety of the OS between phones for say an upgrade or is it just not possible?
04:58:47 <TheJollyRoger> jciferno[m]: it's a tad bit ugly, but...
04:58:58 <TheJollyRoger> Plug in a USB drive.
04:59:00 <strcat[m]> jciferno: that's not possible and fundamentally wouldn't work
04:59:20 <strcat[m]> jciferno: suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
04:59:25 <strcat[m]> and also the OS images are per-device-model
04:59:32 <strcat[m]> so I don't really know what you want to copy
04:59:34 <TheJollyRoger> You can copy the shared storage of other profiles onto the USB drive, if you're OK with crossing the streams.
04:59:49 <TheJollyRoger> Then plug them in again later into the device you want to restore to.
05:00:13 <strcat[m]> jciferno: Seedvault is the backup implementation, any limitations of backups are something that Seedvault needs to improve
05:00:42 <strcat[m]> jciferno: it backs up OS and app data in a portable, robust way that can be restored on another device or after a factory reset
05:01:32 <TheJollyRoger> It's ugly, but it will allow you to save and restore the shared storage of your other profiles or transfer files between them, by saving them to a USB drive first.
05:01:42 <strcat[m]> jciferno: it has some limitations which need to be fixed: doesn't support secondary profiles yet, doesn't support backing up profile home directories yet (just OS and app data), doesn't support device-to-device backup feature for API 30+ where allowBackup="false" is meant to be defined as only disabling remote backups
05:01:56 <strcat[m]> jciferno: all stuff that has to be addressed by Seedvault
05:02:03 <strcat[m]> there is not another way to backup OS or app data
05:02:31 <strcat[m]> it has to be done via the backup service infrastructure by a backup service included in the OS
05:02:37 <strcat[m]> that's how the OS security model works
05:03:10 <strcat[m]> jciferno: if you DID have some way of backing up the data directly from storage... that would be no good to you since all data is encrypted
05:03:16 <strcat[m]> data and metadata is encrypted
05:03:24 <strcat[m]> you can't decrypt it elsewhere, even with the passphrases for the profiles
05:03:33 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
05:03:37 <jciferno[m]> strcat:
05:05:04 <strcat[m]> lots of data is stored in a non-portable way, is inherently specific to the install, is specific to the device model, etc.
05:05:41 <strcat[m]> the OS has backup infrastructure which deals with all that
05:05:42 <strcat[m]> by default, it backs up the entirety of an app's data
05:05:43 <strcat[m]> the app can manually exclude files like caches, session tokens, etc. which shouldn't be backed up
05:05:57 <strcat[m]> and an app can implement an override of the backup service for themselves where they convert data to and from a portable format for backup/restore
05:06:27 <strcat[m]> unfortunately, many app developers are very lazy and historically have set allowBackup="false" to avoid thinking about which files they should exclude, etc.
05:06:41 <strcat[m]> for API 30+, allowBackup="false" is meant to be interpreted as only disabling remote backups
05:06:47 <strcat[m]> to work around app developers
05:06:58 <strcat[m]> Seedvault doesn't implement that yet
05:07:20 <strcat[m]> and the fact that it doesn't back up secondary profiles yet or the profile home directories is entirely a Seedvault limitation that needs to be addressed
05:08:03 <strcat[m]> anyway, that's how backups work, there won't be another way to do it, and you're welcome to read about encryption, the OS security model, and also look into why data is often inherently tied to a device / install
05:08:04 <Mush> does Verizon work with Graphene?
05:08:25 <strcat[m]> Mush: yes, but it doesn't have all the modern functionality
05:08:35 <Mush> such as?
05:08:45 <strcat[m]> Mush: seems to be a continuation of the same thing from before, didn't we already go through this?
05:08:53 <chi00[m]> if you buy through verizon isnt it locked?
05:09:00 <strcat[m]> Mush: SMS works fine on Verizon, if you're having issues it's not something shared by other people
05:09:15 <jciferno[m]> strcat: okay, I see what you are saying so for my general application, ill have to wait for more development progress. Ill see what I can do for my current objective using current functionality of seed vault. Lots of info to digest, ill read more into the encryption and see what I can learn! Thanks for the help!
05:09:19 <strcat[m]> chi00: different thing than *using* Verizon rather than buying a phone from them
05:09:21 <battlepad[m]> Hey guys is there any way to sync notifications from a googled phone to grapheneOS? Not receiving protonmail/banking push notifications can be quite a pain sometimes
05:09:38 <Mush> yes I understand how troubleshooting works. But I was just thinking about moving over to T-Mobile since you guys suggessted
05:09:42 <Mush> it
05:09:50 <battlepad[m]> I can't seem to find any open source notification sync apps
05:09:54 <strcat[m]> Mush: so for example I doubt VoLTE, VoWi-Fi, etc. work with Verizon
05:09:57 <strcat[m]> but it does with T-Mobile
05:10:08 <strcat[m]> Mush: I just would expect a better experience on T-Mobile in general
05:10:16 <strcat[m]>  * Mush: you can expect a better experience on T-Mobile in general
05:10:29 <strcat[m]> Verizon is hostile towards bringing your own device and hostile towards devices without their bloatware bundled
05:10:44 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m]: I think the easiest way to do what you are hoping to do, is to ask the app authors to implement their own fallback to make their own push notifications in the absence of play services.
05:10:45 <strcat[m]> compared to other carriers where if something doesn't work it's generally just their incompetent
05:10:49 <strcat[m]>  * compared to other carriers where if something doesn't work it's generally just their incompetence
05:11:07 <strcat[m]> Mush: so, Verizon works, but they deliberately cripple it
05:11:10 <battlepad[m]> <TheJollyRoger "battlepad: I think the easiest w"> I doubt they will which is why im looking for other alternatives
05:11:28 <strcat[m]> battlepad: use different apps, there are email apps with push
05:11:41 <somenerd[m]> I mean, protonmail purposefully uses their own notif system afaik
05:12:01 <somenerd[m]> I believe that it was to get people to buy the subscription for the email client beidge
05:12:05 <somenerd[m]>  * I believe that it was to get people to buy the subscription for the email client bridge
05:12:06 <strcat[m]> and I'd seriously question how privacy friendly a provider could be if they force you to have deeply integrated Google services to receive notifications
05:12:55 <battlepad[m]> I have no choice but to use a few apps that use GMS, but im keeping them in my spare googled phone with my grapheneOS as my main phone
05:13:27 <strcat[m]> it's possible for an app to request access to listen to notifications
05:13:35 <strcat[m]> and it could send those notifications to another phone via a server with push
05:13:48 <battlepad[m]> it isn't very practical to bring 2 phones everywhere so I was wondering if i could get notified on my grapheneOS if i had any important notifications from my googled phone
05:13:48 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean that such an app exists
05:13:54 <strcat[m]> seems like an incredibly niche/specialized thing that probably does not exist
05:14:07 <strcat[m]> you would have to pay a developer to make you it, in all likelihood
05:14:10 <strcat[m]> seriously doubt it exists
05:14:18 <somenerd[m]> may require leaking notifs to a service, if it does
05:14:23 <strcat[m]> just because it's entirely possible to make doesn't mean it exists (it is definitely possible to make)
05:14:26 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it could use E2E encryption
05:14:33 <battlepad[m]> <strcat[m] "it's possible for an app to requ"> XDA bridge, but sadly it requires google services
05:14:38 <strcat[m]> somenerd: show QR code on device sending notifications, scan it from device receiving notifications
05:14:43 <somenerd[m]> yeah, that's why I said may lol
05:14:54 <TheJollyRoger> At that rate, I would start to wonder if it would be easier just to pay a developer to contribute code directly to the app to make it do its own push polling.
05:15:11 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it has to be implemented by the server
05:15:13 <strcat[m]> and it's not polling
05:15:19 <strcat[m]> polling is a different thing from push
05:15:24 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, whoops, sorry.
05:16:34 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> isn't the discord app invasive? I don't know if it would work because it uses google doesn't it?
05:16:39 <somenerd[m]> I think that proton doesn't use it on purpose
05:17:01 <strcat[m]> p8tuahpirua5ra: all apps are sandboxed + don't know what you mean by invasive
05:17:03 <somenerd[m]> > isn't the discord app invasive? I don't know if it would work because it uses google doesn't it?
05:17:03 <somenerd[m]> I mean, some apps break, but others only lose notifications
05:17:13 <strcat[m]> and others work perfectly fine without it
05:17:16 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> okay
05:17:16 <strcat[m]> because they have fallbacks
05:17:25 <strcat[m]> it is not mandatory to use FCM for push
05:17:26 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> so I can use the discord app then?
05:17:27 <strcat[m]> you can do push without it
05:17:46 <strcat[m]> p8tuahpirua5ra: the best thing to do is try the app you want to use
05:17:50 <strcat[m]> and see if it works yourself
05:18:16 <p8tuahpirua5ra[m> okay
05:18:19 <dannyknoll3Danny> <strcat[m] "Mush: so for example I doubt VoL"> Oh, VoLTE works ‚Äî just, when it wants to. I'm at a 50% success rate with Verizon programming success, lol
05:19:31 <sjsndnjdejd> how much different does it make using web instead app when you are required to login
05:20:30 <battlepad[m]> not much difference usability wise
05:20:44 <sjsndnjdejd> privacy wise
05:21:19 <battlepad[m]> privacy wise it's always better as it cant access your phone directly or ask for any permissions
05:21:28 <strcat[m]> it makes a big difference in terms of security, the app sandbox has far more attack surface
05:21:36 <battlepad[m]> im not sure how to properly phrase this, but techlore/the hated one did a video on this
05:22:02 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, but if the app is e2ee, there may be problems with using the web interface
05:22:17 <somenerd[m]> (don't think that they were referring to e2ee apps though)
05:22:20 <strcat[m]> in terms of privacy, if you don't grant it access to any sensitive data, it mostly gets to see a bit more of your device configuration and which other apps are in the profile
05:22:48 <battlepad[m]> <strcat[m] "in terms of privacy, if you *don"> ah yes this was what i was trying to say, yup this is the tldr of it
05:22:56 <strcat[m]> so, huge security difference, but limited privacy difference when not granting it additional access through it being an app
05:23:49 <strcat[m]> so, if it's not exploiting anything, the privacy difference is mostly it gets to see additional configuration + which other apps are around in that profile
05:23:59 <Mush> okay so support team has been on this for 2 hours and they have tested all features of the network messaging issue and they have made 0% progress. Looks like i'm switching over to to T-Mobile tomorrow strcat
05:24:03 <strcat[m]> web pages do get told your time zone, locale, etc.
05:24:41 <strcat[m]> by the browser
05:24:47 <Mush> they have tried toggling RCS and iMessage with no luck. And my phone on their network shows as "FREE CELL PHONE"
05:25:06 <strcat[m]> it's probably a carrier issue on their side
05:25:13 <strcat[m]> haven't heard of this specific problem before
05:25:17 <strcat[m]> seems pretty weird
05:25:29 <strcat[m]> so they can probably fix it but... you'll be happier on T-Mobile overall anyway
05:25:34 <Mush> I think it is...but I was looking into what are APNs and I noticed a github repository from like 2019 about this issue
05:25:59 <strcat[m]> it could be you have a really old SIM that has some really old carrier id, etc.
05:26:04 <strcat[m]> and they still partially support it via backwards compat
05:26:16 <Mush> ^ you make a good point.
05:26:22 <Mush> it's about 3 years old sim
05:26:31 <Mush> so T-Mobile will work better anyway
05:26:32 <strcat[m]> so for example, I have a SIM from Mobilicity, which no longer exists
05:26:45 <strcat[m]> and the actual carrier it is now implements backwards compatibility for it
05:26:53 <Mush> oh wow
05:27:01 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilicity
05:27:22 <Mush> interesting you live in canada and they do that.
05:27:30 <strcat[m]> I should move to something better but it is kinda nice having unlimited data for $30/month instead of $100/month
05:27:44 <Mush> yeah Verizon Price gouges
05:27:54 <strcat[m]> canada has among the most expensive cell phone plans / internet in the world
05:28:03 <Mush> damn
05:28:10 <Mush> hey strcat do you have Threema?
05:28:15 <somenerd[m]> > so for example, I have a SIM from Mobilicity, which no longer exists
05:28:15 <somenerd[m]> lol
05:28:31 <strcat[m]> https://www.rogers.com/plans
05:28:34 <strcat[m]> look at this garbage
05:29:01 <Mush> what in the fu**
05:29:31 <strcat[m]> so yeah at some point I should probably move to one of those plans
05:29:49 <strcat[m]> just annoying paying 3x as much just because they purposely crippled my carrier
05:30:12 <strcat[m]> I have a grandfathered plan that they purposely crippled including breaking LTE
05:30:16 <strcat[m]> basically
05:30:26 <Mush> yikes bro that sucks
05:30:57 <sjsndnjdejd> <strcat[m] "https://www.rogers.com/plans"> That‚Äôs cheaper than Verizon. Single line plan unlimited everything (LTE) 70USD
05:32:19 <Mush> it's literally $45 for TMobile Unlimited
05:32:22 <Mush> wow
05:32:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, in Canada we get GOUGED hard for internet.
05:33:02 <Mush> $540/year T-Mobile vs $840/year for Verizon
05:33:09 <Mush> yeah i'm switching
05:33:23 <Mush> for one phone smh
05:33:50 <Mush> ok gn guys ty for the help
05:33:55 <TheJollyRoger> Sleep well, me hearty.
05:34:49 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: man that's awful, re crippling LTE on an otherwise good plan >_<.
05:35:21 <strcat[m]> yeah I need to switch carriers
05:35:23 <strcat[m]> just a hassle
05:35:29 <strcat[m]> since I'd want to keep the number
05:36:50 <sjsndnjdejd> <Mush "$540/year T-Mobile vs $840/year "> When you terminate with vzn in the middle of the month, do they bill half month or whole month?
05:47:37 <TheJollyRoger> I had to get my number ported out when I switched to Freedom Mobile. Back then I remember all you had to do was fill out a form and wait for a little bit, but unfortunately this meant you had to visit a retail location, so that's a big no-go right now...
05:50:24 <Eddy[m]> Dude buying a pixel phone and then praying its not the Verizon version is tough
05:50:36 <Eddy[m]> Rough*
05:51:06 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: yeah, as the months pass, and the devices begin to get older, after a while the resellers start to flood the market with locked devices, as well, to get rid of them before they become worthless.
05:51:33 <TheJollyRoger> So your safest bet is to actually buy direct from Google, since the kids slinging phones at the retailers won't be checking what's in the box.
05:51:38 <TheJollyRoger> Or knowing that there's a difference.
05:52:09 <Eddy[m]> I already bought mine and got lucky
05:52:16 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Glad to hear!
05:52:18 <Eddy[m]> I'm on graphene rn
05:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> \o/ Welcome aboard!
05:53:07 <Eddy[m]> How do modern phone users cope with being literally milked like cows with ads and attention based tracking and shit
05:53:09 <Eddy[m]> Like
05:53:16 <Eddy[m]> What
05:53:21 <Eddy[m]> Install graphene
05:54:29 <zzxx123_> same for everyone so it must be fine
05:56:26 <Eddy[m]> That's the cope
05:56:46 <Eddy[m]> >TFW gets bullied for not being a slave
05:57:02 <Eddy[m]> Just use an iPhone
05:57:06 <Eddy[m]> They say
05:57:17 <Eddy[m]> Its privacy respecting! They say
06:01:51 <Real[m]> <Eddy[m] "How do modern phone users cope w"> Let me tell you
06:02:01 <Real[m]> Yesterday I checked my dads phone
06:02:28 <Real[m]> And even the homescreen was full of Ads
06:03:27 <Real[m]> He uses the banking app on that phone...imagine
06:04:18 <Real[m]> He told me he has 2FA and he doesn't care about data as long as his banking app is safe
06:05:02 <Real[m]> OK boomer
06:16:39 <Jgem[m]> I bought a carrier unlocked .. But then put it on Verizon prepay because they have the best service in various rural and mountain areas in California, and I had never heard this specific talk against Verizon over the other big names
06:18:11 <Jgem[m]> Got grapheneos on this pixel 5 and seems to work awesome.. And love it
06:19:48 <Eddy[m]> <Real[m] "Let me tell you"> Dude that's nothing my moms truecaller ap literally occasionally disrupts her workflow and randomly shows an add on her screen
06:19:59 <Eddy[m]> Doesn't even matter if she's using the app or not
06:39:09 <Mush> hey strcat i figured out my text message issue. It was not working because signal needs google services to send over the carrier network.
06:39:55 <strcat[m]> Mush: huh?
06:40:11 <strcat[m]> Mush: the default Messaging app and Signal both work without Play services
06:40:23 <strcat[m]> and you said you were using the default app, didn't you?
06:40:54 <Mush> i don't know why but if a user tries to send me a message on signal in which I was already a member of on my previous phone, then their message won't go through to me on my pixel 4 XL
06:41:18 <Mush> Yes I was using the default GrapheneOS app.
06:41:39 <Mush> and it works with the default if someone messages me with their default messaging app or another messaging app. Just not signal....
06:42:25 <Mush> I have not tried it with an iPhone message though...so going to look into that. It should be ok. All testing has been done with android strcat
06:43:01 <strcat[m]> Mush: doesn't sound like the issue has anything to do with Play services
06:43:11 <Mush> yeah I relaized that after I wrote it.
06:43:23 <Mush> i think it's my account on signal I registered
06:43:31 <strcat[m]> Mush: Signal works without Play services
06:43:32 <Mush> maybe if I deactivate or delete it, it will work
06:43:32 <strcat[m]> SMS works fine without Play services
06:43:36 <strcat[m]> Mush: it sounds like you had a contact on Signal, who was sending you messages over Signal, not SMS messages, and you don't have Signal anymore?
06:43:44 <strcat[m]> Mush: Signal works fine without Play services
06:43:47 <strcat[m]> do you have Signal installed?
06:44:00 <Mush> I still have signal, but it's installed on my PC as well as my old phone
06:44:07 <Mush> I have to transfer it over to see if it makes a difference
06:44:10 <strcat[m]> well, then the messages will go to your old phone
06:44:15 <strcat[m]> Mush: they're sending you Signal messages
06:44:16 <strcat[m]> not SMS
06:44:28 <strcat[m]> Mush: so, yeah, that makes sense, your Signal messages go to where you have Signal
06:44:36 <strcat[m]> Signal messages aren't SMS
06:44:47 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with Play services or SMS
06:44:58 <Mush> yeah I get that now. Thank you for clearing it up. So in theory it should work if I delete my signal account
06:45:02 <strcat[m]> Mush: you can use Signal's encrypted backed feature to back up and restore
06:45:08 <strcat[m]> Mush: why do that?
06:45:17 <Mush> because I use Threema
06:45:19 <strcat[m]> just backup Signal, transfer over the backup
06:45:23 <strcat[m]> install it and launch it
06:45:25 <strcat[m]> and it will restore
06:45:42 <strcat[m]> Mush: having them send you SMS instead of Signal messages doesn't sound like an improvement
06:45:45 <Mush> nah, threema is better IMHO
06:45:59 <Mush> i've backed it up before and messed with that setup
06:46:08 <Mush> https://threema.ch/en/
06:46:29 <strcat[m]> regardless of what you think is better SMS is totally insecure and downgrading chats to SMS by forcing people not to use Signal to contact you is a major step backwards
06:46:58 <strcat[m]> Mush: Threema lacks E2E encryption with forward secrecy among other serious problems BTW
06:47:22 <Mush> no it doesn't. It has E2E. where do you see that?
06:47:30 <strcat[m]> that's not what I say
06:47:30 <Mush> i'm actually curious
06:47:36 <strcat[m]> I said it lacks E2E encryption with forward secrecy
06:47:37 <strcat[m]> that's a fact
06:47:45 <strcat[m]> read their own FAQ
06:47:50 <Mush> forward secrecy...
06:48:07 <Mush> hmm..reading
06:48:23 <strcat[m]> https://threema.ch/en/faq/why_secure presents it as them having forward secrecy only for the transport layer
06:48:26 <strcat[m]> pretty serious limitation
06:48:41 <strcat[m]> a proper E2E encryption protocol has forward secrecy
06:49:08 <strcat[m]> doesn't simply rely on TLS having transport layer forward secrecy (i.e. your traffic has no forward secrecy in regards to the server)
06:49:18 <strcat[m]> and that's just an obvious thing that's super wrong
06:49:20 <Mush> hmmmm
06:49:32 <strcat[m]> anyway downgrading chats to SMS
06:49:34 <strcat[m]> is not a good plan
06:49:39 <Mush> https://www.securemessagingapps.com/
06:49:47 <strcat[m]> if you have contacts who use Signal to contact you, why would you downgrade it to SMS?
06:49:49 <Mush> i'll get signal back then
06:50:01 <Mush> I was going to switch them to threema
06:50:20 <strcat[m]> Mush: so, it says right there it doesn't have E2E encryption with forward secrecy
06:50:22 <Mush> but you have to use your phone number with signal so it's not annonymous
06:50:49 <strcat[m]> this contact has your phone number
06:50:51 <Mush> interesting I see that now
06:51:00 <strcat[m]> why would you have them send you SMS instead of secure E2E encrypted messaging?
06:51:05 <strcat[m]> just doesn't make sense to me
06:51:16 <Mush> I wasn't planning on doing that
06:51:20 <strcat[m]> the whole point of Signal is transparency replacing carrier-based calls/texts for your existing phone number based contacts
06:51:35 <strcat[m]> you don't have to use it for contacts who don't have your phone number
06:51:42 <strcat[m]> but I would strongly suggest using something that has a secure E2E encryption protocol with modern cryptography
06:51:49 <strcat[m]> and that includes forward secrecy among other things
06:52:06 <Mush> so forward secrecy is a big deal...
06:52:23 <strcat[m]> yes, among other things but not having it is a sign that things are seriously wrong
06:52:42 <strcat[m]> so, for example, use Matrix E2E encrypted chats, just be aware Matrix leaks a lot more metadata than Signal
06:52:54 <strcat[m]> use Signal for your contacts who have your phone number
06:53:01 <strcat[m]> replace carrier-based calls and texts with it
06:53:03 <Mush> i'm facepalming so hard rn
06:53:09 <Mush> lmao
06:53:15 <strcat[m]> use something like Matrix E2E encrypted chats for other people who you don't want to give your phone number
06:53:22 <strcat[m]> Element works fine
06:53:31 <Mush> I was going to use Element acutally
06:53:51 <strcat[m]> doesn't have proper push yet (has to poll) but works fine
06:54:11 <Mush> interesting.....so should I invest in Element or keep using signal?
06:54:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Why not both?
06:55:07 <Mush> you make a good point, but most people like to have only one client for everything DHFuchsiaOSwhen
06:55:28 <somenerd[m]> I mean, you can use Signal for people you know
06:55:34 <trismous[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Why not both?"> And use certain one with some people and the other with the rest of them
06:55:37 <somenerd[m]> and for people who you trust with your phne number
06:55:41 <somenerd[m]>  * and for people who you trust with your phone number
06:55:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Can't do public chats without Element, and some people prefer using Element over Signal for not giving phone numebrs
06:55:51 <somenerd[m]> and Element for other people
06:56:20 <Mush> hmmm I see. That's some good info. So i'll get Element and go back to signal then
06:56:36 <Mush> got it
06:56:40 <trismous[m]> Both of these apps have different but partially overlapping use cases
06:57:00 <Mush> but I never knew about perfect forward secrecy?
06:57:12 <Mush> that's something really big
06:57:32 <Mush> and threema has no seld destructing messages
06:57:37 <Mush> self*
06:57:52 <pizzaeater69[m]> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy
06:58:38 <Mush> So now I got to go onto threema and remove the apps....nice
06:58:51 <Mush> *sigh*
06:59:08 <Mush> it really does pay to do more research. thanks friends
06:59:24 <trismous[m]> <Mush "and threema has no seld destruct"> You still can screenshot those messages and self destruct is therefore useless
06:59:35 <Mush> Element + Signal it is then
06:59:56 <Mush> trismous yeah that's the best part! haha
07:00:00 <strcat> Mush: forward secrecy combined with self deleting messages is really useful
07:00:17 <strcat> my recommendation overall is to use Signal to replace carrier-based texts/calls, and get your real life contacts to use that, since it's super easy
07:00:39 <strcat> and use Element with for E2E encrypted private/group chats with others
07:00:45 <Mush> yeah. I will do that. I have friends over seas that use telegram and I want them to switch over to Signal
07:00:51 <strcat> and it has calls too
07:00:58 <Mush> now that's nice
07:01:27 <Mush> but does element have forward secrecy? time to find out
07:05:49 <strcat> Mush: yes
07:06:45 <strcat[m]> Matrix basically has a clone of the Signal protocol (not entirely the same)
07:07:02 <strcat[m]> Mush: just keep in mind Element supports non-E2E encrypted chats too, such as this room, since it's public anyway
07:07:34 <strcat[m]> Mush: it has good support for E2E encrypted chats though including cross-signing sessions and syncing data across them and uses it by default
07:07:46 <old_dog69[m]> Just signed in to inform of a possible bug, I have a 4a5g, if you set Mobile Preferred network type to "LTE only" then you can not place/receive calls (caller thinks you are busy).. I turned to 5G and everything is ok now
07:09:13 <old_dog69[m]> (EU network with 5G capability)
07:10:56 <Mush> thank you strcat, I was able to get a refund for both apps
07:11:05 <Mush> sorry* app
07:11:19 <Mush> I had 2 family members who had it and I got their refund
07:14:28 <donkykong[m]> <pizzaeater69[m] "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/"> Thx I'm learning something new üòÅ

07:28:16 <pizzaeater69[m]> Right:D
07:28:58 <tedlancer[m]> Hey why does the user profile not able to install any apks?
07:29:08 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: clarify what you mean

07:29:16 <tedlancer[m]> Anything I need to change in settings
07:29:17 <strcat> secondary user profiles can

07:29:24 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: clarify what you mean
07:29:29 <strcat> where are you trying to install the app, which app
07:29:33 <strcat> how are you trying to install it
07:29:37 <strcat> more info needed or help can't be provided
07:30:00 <tedlancer[m]> Fdroid app on new user not guest profile
07:30:13 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: you're running into an upstream F-Droid issue
07:30:16 <pizzaeater69[m]> <tedlancer[m] "Fdroid app on new user not guest"> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/c5szco/on_new_user_profile_cant_install_fdroid/
07:30:19 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: they publish an old version of the app on their site
07:30:44 <strcat> tedlancer[m]: you cannot install an older version of an app in another profile than you already have installed, that's the issue
07:31:03 <strcat> download the latest version, not the old one they list as the main download link on their site
07:31:11 <strcat> it's very unfortunate that they do this and don't care about how user hostile it is
07:31:19 <strcat> I recommend filing an issue on their tracker
07:31:29 <strcat> and explain exactly why this was confusing and problematic
07:31:53 <strcat> what needs to happen is every person who runs into it needs to tell them it's a problem and then eventually they will realize it's a bad idea to inflict this on users
07:32:14 <tedlancer[m]> OK I'll try that
07:32:30 <tedlancer[m]> It did the same w bromite slso
07:32:33 <somenerd[m]> > what needs to happen is every person who runs into it needs to tell them it's a problem and then eventually they will realize it's a bad idea to inflict this on users
07:32:33 <somenerd[m]> why would they do that though?
07:33:11 <somenerd[m]> (the f-droid team)
07:33:27 <strcat[m]> they have some weird reasoning about the latest version of the app not being as well tested
07:33:32 <strcat[m]> but as soon as you install it, you get updated to that
07:33:35 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make any sense
07:33:48 <strcat[m]> a lot of their decision making and prioritization doesn't make any sense
07:33:50 <somenerd[m]> > they have some weird reasoning about the latest version of the app not being as well tested
07:33:50 <somenerd[m]> then why have the version of that app released lol
07:34:02 <strcat[m]> security and usability suffer for political reasons with F-Droid
07:34:04 <strcat[m]> somenerd: unclear
07:34:17 <strcat[m]> I don't know why they wouldn't just add support for proper beta channels that are opt-in if they want to have beta testing that's actually used
07:34:23 <Mush> is apple music better than spotify?
07:34:29 <Mush> in terms of privacy
07:34:35 <strcat[m]> somenerd: anyway they can't be reasoned with about these usability issues, just as they can't be reasoned with about all kinds of security issues
07:34:45 <strcat[m]> somenerd: no point trying to apply rational thinking to it
07:35:02 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: anyway they can't be reasoned with about these usability issues, just as they can't be reasoned with about all kinds of security issues
07:35:02 <somenerd[m]> like having 4 year old apps...
07:35:05 <pizzaeater69[m]> <Mush "is apple music better than spoti"> I install music from NewPipe to mp3 form and play it from mp3 player, saves battery when on the fly
07:35:07 <strcat[m]> somenerd: their reasoning == the latest F-Droid is too unstable / untested, so they have people install an old version, and then get upgraded to the one they didn't want them to install
07:35:26 <somenerd[m]> >  then get upgraded to the one they didn't want them to install
07:35:26 <somenerd[m]> wow
07:35:30 <pizzaeater69[m]> * I install music from NewPipe to mp3 form and play it from mp3 player, saves battery when on the fly because I can have device on airplane mode
07:35:51 <strcat[m]> imo if people just keep filing bugs about the serious usability issue with profiles they will eventually give in and start listing the latest version they provide as a normal update as the normal app download...
07:35:56 <Mush> pizzaeater69[m] that is nice....too bad my Pixel 4 XL has no expandable storage
07:36:33 <strcat[m]> if it was on the Play Store my recommendation would be leave a 1 star review but the Play Store doesn't currently allow alternate app stores and F-Droid doesn't meet the privacy/security requirements of an app uploaded on the Play Store since it's not API 29+
07:36:39 <strcat[m]> so, yeah
07:36:40 <strcat[m]> but in general
07:36:53 <strcat[m]> file bugs, leave 1 to 3 star reviews explaining what went wrong if it's on the Play Store
07:37:02 <strcat[m]> and if enough people do it they will start to stop being user hostile
07:37:11 <strcat[m]> if an app demands permissions it could do without, leave a 1 star review, file an issue
07:37:22 <strcat[m]> explain it is privacy violating and doesn't respect user consent
07:37:34 <strcat[m]> applies to pretty much any app forcing you to use the legacy Storage permission approach
07:38:09 <pizzaeater69[m]> <Mush "pizzaeater69 that is nice....too"> You can you internal storage imo
07:38:09 <Mush> did you guys know that spotify family plans use geolocating to validate family plans?
07:38:12 <Mush> lmao
07:38:16 <strcat[m]> as another example, a lot of apps demand bulk Contacts permission access
07:38:36 <strcat[m]> instead of allowing you to not use the system contacts but rather manage it inside the app
07:38:57 <strcat[m]> and the OS supports having the user pick a specific contact to use, rather than needing the bulk access permission, anyways
07:39:05 <strcat[m]> also applies to camera access, etc.
07:39:46 <strcat[m]> unless the app must have a custom user interface for taking pictures it can avoid the permission and instead have the user take a picture for it themselves
07:39:50 <strcat[m]> applies to a lot of things
07:40:01 <Koba[m]> How to fix battery drain?
07:40:05 <strcat[m]> what needs to happen is putting pressure on app devs to start caring at all about privacy and user consent
07:40:12 <strcat[m]> Koba: too vague / general of a question

14:23:44 <mynacol[m]> <ultimateextras[m "Question, how well would Graphen"> The system is quite secure. I think it mostly depends on how you use it and which apps you use.
14:24:48 <mynacol[m]> Extra configuration is needed if you want to hide that Graphene is running on the phone.

16:26:21 <Real[m]> <JacksonS "Possible to reflash to delivery "> Yes it is possible but I havent tried it yet.
16:26:41 <Real[m]> But you're surely spoiling the warranty so do it at your own risk
16:28:18 <JacksonS> My goal: I want to test the GrapheneOS on Pixel 5 and if I don't like it, i will undo everything and send the phone back to seller.
16:28:54 <Real[m]> Yes possible
16:29:04 <Real[m]> But make sure you dont brick the phone
16:29:07 <JacksonS> what backup tool i should use?
16:29:40 <ultimateextras[m> I've been doing a bit of research here and there, supposedly you can't root GrapheneOS without it being a special installation. I understand the rationale involving security (even though the whole principle of "don't give them the power to blow themselves up" isn't really something I would agree with fundamentally, but that's not the subject of this (I know there's actual reasons beside this)), what exactly would
16:29:40 <ultimateextras[m> one do in order to achieve a GrapheneOS setup with rooted access?
16:30:06 <Real[m]> Like I said I havent tried that yet but you can use TWRP recovery.
16:33:04 <JacksonS> I think this Tutorial will restore the default setting with bootloader. I am right?
16:33:04 <JacksonS> https://developers.google.com/android/images
16:34:34 <Real[m]> Yeah this will help too but you should make a backup just in case
16:34:39 <JacksonS> I thin i dont need a backup when i can flash Factory Image
16:35:01 <Real[m]> Alright you can do it but get your files first
16:35:06 <JacksonS> No personal data available on the phone.
16:35:22 <Real[m]> Only then proceed
16:35:24 <JacksonS> i bought the phone today.
16:35:34 <Real[m]> Nice
16:35:36 <JacksonS> only for GraphenOS
16:36:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äãcosk> @clannad why Vanadium contain gms code (i talk within knowledge)?
16:36:27 <Real[m]> Why do you want to return the phone then?
16:36:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> What.
16:36:56 <JacksonS> I will try GraphenOS
16:37:20 <JacksonS> when not good with the Pixel then i will return to seller.
16:37:22 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: that's not why it's not supported
16:37:56 <Anon20938[m]> Pixel 2 is the only outdated one.
16:38:04 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: there's no such thing as GrapheneOS with app-accessible root access and it's fundamentally incompatible with the security model, features like verified boot and security basics like the principle of least privilege
16:38:07 <Real[m]> Alright
16:38:17 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: it has little to do with what you said above
16:38:52 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: if implies trusting the entire UI and application layer with root access, which is normally constrained to a few very core system processes
16:38:58 <Real[m]> <JacksonS "when not good with the Pixel the"> Its a decent phone with a great camera...keep it unless you're getting an iPhone you know.
16:39:05 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: also implies trusting persistent state if you expect it to be some kind of setting and something you can grant
16:39:36 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: and I think you're overlooking that it's an irrevocable grant of trust to anything that it's given to, and it's implied that it's given to the UI / application layer of the OS if it's possible for you to grant it to anything else from there
16:40:11 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: i.e. an application simply being able to misdirect user input as an one off thing can gain permanent root access, and verified boot won't work since you're trusting persistent state with that
16:40:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> #grapheneos:matrix.org
16:40:29 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: anyway, if you want that, you don't want what GrapheneOS is all about providing, or even the standard AOSP privacy/security model
16:40:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Installing twrp on grapheneos will brick the device and we will not provide support. You assume full responsibility for the mess you create
16:41:22 <strcat[m]> ultimateextras: and you probably aren't considering that it's a horrible way to actually implement anything in practice, and is a lazy/incompetent shortcut developers take rather than actually implementing things properly by making a privileged component in the OS guarded by a permission and then having apps use that
16:41:56 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense for the application / GUI layer to have root access, and the privileged component hardly ever needs anything like that either, just access to what it actually needs
16:42:22 <strcat[m]> so for example, netd needs CAP_NET_ADMIN to manage the network, and exposes APIs through the system to apps building on that functionality
16:42:48 <JacksonS> When i read the tutorial then i understand that i dont¬† need to install twrp
16:42:51 <strcat[m]> which is how stuff like the Network toggle (INTERNET permission) in GrapheneOS work via netd, and that's how the OS is designed as a whole in general
16:42:56 <strcat[m]> sandboxing, privilege separation, etc.
16:43:11 <strcat[m]> you throw away most of the security model if you do what you want
16:43:14 <strcat[m]> and it wouldn't be GrapheneOs
16:43:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> <JacksonS "When i read the tutorial then i "> Read above
16:43:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Installing twrp on grapheneos wi"> .
16:43:19 <strcat[m]>  * and it wouldn't be GrapheneOS
16:43:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can almost certainly guarantee you it'll brick
16:43:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since our kernel doesn't support the insecure bs twrp needs to work
16:43:51 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is the official source tree and the official releases of the code built from that
16:44:01 <strcat[m]> if you make a fork of the OS, that's a different OS, not GrapheneOS anymore
16:44:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And we are not going to provide support if you brick while installing twrp
16:44:30 <strcat[m]> and I don't really see the point if you regress privacy/security more than GrapheneOS enhances it over AOSP
16:47:54 <ultimateextras[m> (I don't especially *need* root access, but generally speaking. Not everything would need root access, (This is a serious issue with Android in my opinion, there's virtually no straightforward way to say "I, the administrator." without needing *everything* to have root access) most applications you run on GNU/Linux don't always need access besides their own directory, let alone Root access.)

19:23:54 <b1101> brake1110[m]: google provides security updates for 2 years from release, so you can figure out when support will end approximately. the 4 doesn't have a fingerprint scanner. not sure if you like having it
19:24:56 <b1101> you could get a pixel 5; unless it's out of your price range
19:25:24 <ulmirdin[m]> Pixel 4 updates until October 2022, Pixel 4a updates until August 2023.
19:25:40 <ulmirdin[m]> Pixel 4a is just newer
19:26:49 <ulmirdin[m]> And honestly, if you're not playing games on it‚Äîyou won't notice a difference.
19:27:24 <brake1110[m]> <b1101 "you could get a pixel 5; unless "> 5 probably out of price range at the moment. How much longer would it be supported for?
19:28:43 <nscnt[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
19:28:44 <ulmirdin[m]> A few more months than pixel 4@

19:28:53 <ulmirdin[m]> * A few more months than pixel 4a
19:29:15 <brake1110[m]> <ulmirdin[m] "Pixel 4 updates until October 20"> Thank you great info. Do like fingerprint so was a consideration as well.
19:30:15 <ulmirdin[m]> It's nice to have, but I don't personally use it.
19:31:16 <brake1110[m]> <nscnt[m] "https://support.google.com/pixel"> So its about google support period not just graphene os and how long they decide to support a device?
19:31:54 <b1101> yup
19:32:51 <nscnt[m]> Once supported, GrapheneOS strives for the same timeframe
19:35:21 <brake1110[m]> Thanks everyone for the great into. You're all legends. Makes it easy now. 4a as save money over 5 and supported much longer than 4.  Really appreciate it
19:36:52 <b1101> :)
19:38:35 <brake1110[m]> Is this the best place to come back to once im up and running for app questions etc? Will likely need help with getting camera set up correctly etc
19:38:46 <b1101> camera?
19:38:57 <b1101> it just works. though I would suggest getting opencamera
19:39:01 <nscnt[m]> We have #grapheneos-offtopic / #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
19:39:43 <brake1110[m]> <nscnt[m] "We have #grapheneos-offtopic / #"> Perfect thank you
19:40:15 <brake1110[m]> <b1101 "it just works. though I would su"> Awesome. Sort of info im after.
19:45:58 <brake1110[m]> While I think of it. Is there a good way to access gmail etc on device running graphene os
19:45:59 <brake1110[m]> mm
19:46:16 <b1101> ya. google camera doesn't function. also doesn't show up in aurora store for some reason.
19:47:31 <b1101> brake1110[m]: imap with one of the open source email apps. I use k9.
19:49:57 <brake1110[m]> While I think of it is there a good way look at gmail etc on grapheneos that doesn't compromise the purpose of having grapheneos. Same for facebook etc.¬†is it best to just use web browser for these or even multiple web browsers
19:52:57 <gofam[m]> <jj1013[m]1 "If anyone is wondering, I am @go"> Hey @gochoingles the Telegrammer
19:53:01 <gofam[m]> Welcome to the circle
19:53:08 <strcat[m]> using an email app to access an email provider gives it a lot less power than a web site
19:53:25 <strcat[m]> IMAP is certainly a lot simpler than running a web page
19:55:10 <rny> imap does so much more than internet mail it is a protocol that is incorrect named.
19:55:13 <rny> [o/t]
19:56:35 <brake1110[m]> <strcat[m] "using an email app to access an "> Ok great thanks
19:59:22 <strcat[m]> 48-bit address space confirmed to work on Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a so far
19:59:29 <strcat[m]> doing Pixel 4a (5G) / Pixel 5 next
19:59:38 <strcat[m]>  * 48-bit address space confirmed to work on Pixel 4 / Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a so far
20:00:02 <strcat[m]> expect it breaks on Pixel 3 / Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 3a / Pixel 3a XL
20:03:22 <rny> time to change phones
20:03:26 <rny> :(
20:05:13 <katapulsator> what can i do to play games on grapheneos, game apps not working...
20:16:47 <b1101> if they're play services dependent you're out of luck
20:17:07 <katapulsator> and with mircrog?
20:17:17 <katapulsator> microg
20:17:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> What app is this?
20:17:31 <rny> its offtopic
20:17:39 <katapulsator> yea
20:18:30 <katapulsator> thanks anyway
20:50:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äãcosk> No answer?
20:50:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äãcosk> Is a feature from a reversing tool
21:01:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H‚Äãandyberlin> Who could help me reprogram GrapheneOS?  I will of course pay
21:09:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> I don't think they can see the video in IRC
21:09:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Cellebrite?
21:09:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m‚Äãadaidan> What
21:10:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äãcosk> Jajajajaa noooo
21:10:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H‚Äãandyberlin> Can yoh write me i cant write to you
21:10:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> HodlNodl (@h‚Äãodlnodl) has joined the Telegram Group!

21:11:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> What's the name
21:12:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äãcosk> MT Manager, possibly a scam chinese app
21:12:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äãcosk> Only i use it on my old phone.
21:12:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãodlnodl> Is this the best place to get some help with a new installation of GrapheneOS on a Pixel 5?
21:14:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Oof I was hoping it was something FLOSS
21:14:57 <strcat> use https://grapheneos.org/install/web for installing
21:16:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãodlnodl> I have successfully installed. The issue I have is the keyboard haptics/sounds are switched off in settings but doesn't work.
21:17:25 <dannyknoll3Danny> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Dcosk> MT Manager, possibly a s"> Take this to off-topic please. Interesting topic, though.
21:33:07 <johnk347[m]> What do I lose upgrading to pixel 4a 5g over pixel 5? I am on a 3a XL currently.
21:33:45 <b1101> 90hz screen. battery life
21:33:58 <rny> johnk347[m]: more battery life on 4a 5g no?
21:34:08 <rny> and also wireless charging
21:35:03 <b1101> nope
21:35:24 <b1101> 3885 to 4080
21:35:34 <rny> but 90hz saps more no?
21:35:44 <johnk347[m]> Slightly less battery
21:35:45 <b1101> doesn't mean you have to run the phone at 90
21:35:53 <Eddy[m]> Hello there
21:36:04 <johnk347[m]> But way more than I have now.
21:36:09 <Eddy[m]> Is it possible to become root using termux on graphene?
21:36:36 <b1101> I'm curious what the 6 is going to have.
21:36:54 <johnk347[m]> And the headphone jack is tempting too.
21:37:11 <johnk347[m]> <b1101 "I'm curious what the 6 is going "> Same.
21:37:27 <flawedworld[m]> <Eddy[m] "Is it possible to become root us"> No, this would violate the security model of Android and GrapheneOS.
21:37:36 <rny> i hope they include a mini nuclear reactor in the pixel 56
21:37:53 <b1101> lol
21:38:08 <johnk347[m]> <rny "i hope they include a mini nucle"> Pixel 76*
21:38:49 <strcat> rny: you can toggle off 90Hz
21:38:54 <strcat> it's optional
21:40:33 <strcat> johnk347[m]: Pixel 5 has nicer screen (not just 90Hz), nicer build, wireless charging, proper dust/waterproofing, 2GB more memory
21:40:50 <strcat> more memory really useful for GrapheneOS
21:42:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> <rny "i hope they include a mini nucle"> hopefully we won't need nuclear energy anymore by the time we get to the pixel 56
21:53:04 <nscnt[m]> hand crank dynamo Pixel :^)
21:54:53 <johnk347[m]> strcat: is it worth twice the price?
21:54:53 <johnk347[m]> I can get a 4a 5g for 349 right now brand new.
21:55:19 <strcat[m]> same SoC, same security
21:55:25 <strcat[m]> up to you if those things listed above are worth the money
21:58:29 <johnk347[m]> strcat: thanks.
22:12:29 <came2complain[m]> where can you get the 5g for 349?
22:13:11 <hasnoname[m]> Secondary profiles cannot use a third party sms client?

22:17:15 <borges[m]> Is there a way to remove the default messaging app from the app drawer? In app info the disable action is itself disabled...
22:18:54 <borges[m]> hasnoname: I'm using QKSMS and I (believe) I am getting sms messages
22:20:06 <hasnoname[m]> <borges[m] "hasnoname: I'm using QKSMS and I"> Is it in secondary profile?
22:20:11 <borges[m]> I have noticed this message in logcat: "SmsApplication: com.android.mms.service does not have OP_WRITE_SMS:  (fixing)". I see that for phone and sms too.
22:20:18 <hasnoname[m]> <borges[m] "Is there a way to remove the def"> You can disable it with adb though
22:20:34 <borges[m]> hasnoname: missed the secondary profile part, no, haven't tried that
22:20:58 <hasnoname[m]> <borges[m] "hasnoname: missed the secondary "> It worked with primary profile
22:21:07 <hasnoname[m]> Not with secondary
22:24:00 <borges[m]> hasnoname: is com.android.messaging the one I need to disable via adb?
22:25:31 <hasnoname[m]> <borges[m] "hasnoname: is com.android.messag"> I don't know the name of the package.
22:25:51 <hasnoname[m]> Do a pm list packages or find it in netguard app
22:29:27 <borges[m]> hasnoname: ok that's the right app id, but "adb shell pm disable --user 0 com.android.messaging" returns an error
22:29:35 <borges[m]> Exception occurred while executing 'disable':
22:29:35 <borges[m]> java.lang.SecurityException: Shell cannot change component state for com.android.messaging/null to 2
22:29:50 <borges[m]> So, I don't think it can actually be done via adb
22:30:45 <hasnoname[m]> <hasnoname[m] "Secondary profiles cannot use a "> Also the ringtone for carrier calls on secondary profile is different to what I set.
22:31:21 <borges[m]> <hasnoname[m] "Also the ringtone for carrier ca"> Different to what you set in the secondary user profile?
22:31:33 <hasnoname[m]> <borges[m] "Different to what you set in the"> Yes
22:32:15 <borges[m]> Sounds like a good candidate for a filing a bug report
23:56:23 <coolphone> Anyone know if 5G can be reliably disabled on a pixel 5 with a 5G carrier? Maybe LTE only mode?
