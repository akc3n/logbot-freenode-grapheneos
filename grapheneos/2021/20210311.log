00:12:32 <strcat[m]> it sounds like they tried to fix their Chromium package at one point
00:12:41 <strcat[m]> please file a new bug with them
00:12:55 <strcat[m]> and I really mean it, please go file a bug with them about it
00:13:30 <strcat[m]> they're likely to fix whatever is wrong with it since they want to promote snaps
00:15:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Dominik shared a photo on Telegram with caption: ''
00:15:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Dominik> Anyone know why, ans how to avoid, it comes up when writing system,
00:19:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Dominik> Probably someone had the same issue
00:29:05 <bauershades[m]> Lil bug: if I try to trim a video in the gallery app the video keeps stuttering
00:32:28 <strcat[m]> gallery app is an AOSP app
00:32:31 <strcat[m]> not something we develop
00:32:37 <strcat[m]> and I'd recommend just using something better
00:40:32 <bauershades[m]> <strcat[m] "and I'd recommend just using som"> Used signal üôè
00:45:07 <luberlufte[m]> Is the USB web installer mentioned on the grsphene docs available somewhere?
00:45:26 <luberlufte[m]> Is it like the one on the Calyx site?
00:45:39 <flawedworld[m]> <strcat[m] "they're likely to fix whatever i"> ```sudo snap connect chromium:raw-usb```
00:46:50 <flawedworld[m]> strcat: its not broken, but it seems they just intend for you to manually give it access when needed
00:47:19 <flawedworld[m]> might be worth adding to docs
00:48:01 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: it needs root? seems pretty bad
00:48:16 <strcat[m]> there should be a way to grant it access to a specific USB device and it should be able to just request it and have a dialog
00:48:20 <strcat[m]> that's how it works on Android...
00:48:46 <flawedworld[m]> agree, snap isnt exactly the best way to confine things...
00:48:54 <strcat[m]> I'll just tell people to avoid Chromium on Ubuntu, running a CLI command isn't an acceptable part of the guide
00:49:06 <strcat[m]> or I'll drop Ubuntu as officially supported for the web installer
00:49:44 <flawedworld[m]> understood
00:50:32 <strcat[m]> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/chromium-browser/+bug/1905457
00:50:37 <strcat[m]> it's just broken
00:50:46 <strcat[m]> it permits all kinds of arbitrary things that are not based on filesystem access
00:51:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Canonisoft strikes again
00:51:35 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: so their regular Chromium package is a Snap now?
00:51:43 <strcat[m]> I'll just tell people to avoid it, the workaround is unacceptable
00:52:31 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: can you check that for me?
00:52:40 <strcat[m]> I'll just say that Chromium is only supported on Debian and Arch Linux
00:52:43 <strcat[m]> and explicitly not Ubuntu
00:52:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Yes this is why I don't advise people to use Ubuntu anymore. They just shove snap down your throat
00:52:51 <flawedworld[m]> I'm looking into it rn for you strcat
00:53:07 <strcat[m]> thanks
00:53:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> Oofbuntu
00:54:34 <madaidan[m]> Uwubuntu
00:54:51 <flawedworld[m]> strcat: they seem to have fully moved to snapd for 20.04 and newer
00:54:56 <sjsndnjdejd> <strcat[m] "flawedworld: so their regular Ch"> Yes
00:55:09 <flawedworld[m]> 18.04 packages traditional chromium still
00:56:07 <bauershades[m]> <strcat[m] "gallery app is an AOSP app"> Doesn't that make the os vulnerable if you download a random video or something? Or does the sandboxing take care of that ü§î
00:56:42 <flawedworld[m]> <bauershades[m] "Doesn't that make the os vulnera"> Don't get what you mean. Nothing inherently vulnerable about it being an AOSP app.
00:56:56 <sjsndnjdejd> Almost Linux Mint dropped chromium package entirely because of this
00:57:05 <strcat[m]> bauershades: I don't understand how you jump to that kind of weird conclusion
00:57:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> Try not to download stuff from shady sources anyway
00:57:29 <sjsndnjdejd> * Linux Mint dropped chromium package entirely because of this

00:57:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> <sjsndnjdejd "Almost Linux Mint dropped chromi"> Oh yeah.

00:59:38 <flawedworld[m]> btw strcat nexus launcher has android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS on stock which currently I am guessing is what is being used to grant notification permissions. I don't see where they are doing notification access explicitly.
00:59:59 * flawedworld[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YcIQxjbKuSTDLLSjEOuLqCeY/message.txt >
01:00:05 <flawedworld[m]> unsure tho tbh
01:01:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> * Oh yeah. https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3906
01:01:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <i‚Äãmabug> does anyone know any way to get notified of lives on youtube? since they stopped sending emails, I have not found an alternative to it
01:03:14 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: privileged permission whitelists don't do what you think
01:03:25 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: they just allow the app to have the permission it declares in the manifest if it's a `privileged` permission
01:03:46 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: doesn't do anything for non-`privileged` permissions and it only does something for a `priv-app` which it isn't
01:04:22 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: the sole purpose is to require that a `priv-app` has `privileged` permissions whitelisted in a central place rather than being able to obtain any via the fact that they are `priv-app` and declare it in their manifest
01:05:13 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: the reason for it is because the OS supports out-of-band updates for app components and a vendor may bundle third party apps as priv-apps, but they shouldn't be able to get more privileged permissions through app updates
01:06:06 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: if it's not a permission marked `privileged` that's obtained through being a priv-app then it just doesn't do anything, it's not a way to grant default permissions or other kinds
01:09:49 <flawedworld[m]> Ahh I see. This certainly clears up things for me, will be putting that in my notes straight away. Thank you for the explanation strcat
01:31:33 <sjsndnjdejd> <Gui_Do "hi guys, are graphene developers"> You can tell by looking at the fonts on his screenshots btw
02:22:55 <strcat> sjsndnjdejd: I use Windows-style font rendering on Linux so it doesn't look that much different
02:23:54 <strcat> same monitor (2x) for both which is ~161dpi (4k, 27 inch)
02:24:59 <strcat> Windows style font rendering isn't going to look good in a screenshot since it's doing subpixel hinting, etc.
02:25:21 <strcat> if I had 300dpi monitors then I'd probably turn that stuff off
02:25:40 <strcat> like how Android renders for high dpi screens
02:25:55 <strcat> (or macOS/iOS)
02:28:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Gabe> hi m8, your photo didnt come thru on matrix, are you using  a pixel 2 device by any chance? For reference to anyone on matrix, WebUSB installer timed out after 10000ms in the screenshot on telegram.

04:29:35 <bard66> Trying to install graphene, but having issues with the flashing step. I have the latest platform/img/etc. The bat just opens and instantly closes. No error/messages or anything. Any ideas? (windows 10os)
04:32:50 <manjaroborker> Anyone in here right now?
04:33:23 <manjaroborker> Had a few questions about graphene OS
04:34:46 <manjaroborker> What is the best U.S Tmobile 4G phone that I can use with Graphene OS? Most of them seem to have a locked bootloader.
04:35:10 <manjaroborker> Also does Graphene come with F-Droid already installed?
04:38:26 <TheJollyRoger> bard66: What's happening there is you're not following the instructions. You'll want to go to https://grapheneos.org/install/web if you can't use the commandline.
04:39:12 <TheJollyRoger> We recommend the web install method as a harm reduction strategy: too many people have disregarded the official instructions, or followed incorrect, hinky, and outdated third-party installation guides and ended up with bricked/unbootable devices.
04:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> manjaroborker: The best phone for running GrapheneOS is the 5, carrier unlocked, and purchased directly from the Google Store, or if you are on a budget and money is tight, the 4a. If T-Mobile does not require privileged management drivers to be installed from your carrier, or T-Mobile allows Bring-Your-Own Devices, it should work. We don't recommend resellers since many of them sell you locked
04:40:49 <TheJollyRoger> devices and don't tell you until it's too late.
04:41:27 <TheJollyRoger> manjaroborker: GrapheneOS does not come with an application store. If you want F-Droid, you'll have to download and install it yourself, and add it to the "install other apps" permissions whitelist.
04:43:30 <TheJollyRoger> bard66: If you want to install via the commandline, you must follow the official instructions, or risk a brick. The commandline installation method is now only intended for reverse compatibility with users who have preexisting setups. You get no advantage from using it except for the warm fuzzy feeling of feeling like a Linux nerd. It is faster, easier, and safer for you to simply use the Web
04:43:32 <TheJollyRoger> Installer.
04:43:36 <bard66> your web version gives me the error "Error: Failed to construct 'Worker': Access to the script at 'https://grapheneos.org/js/fastboot/dist/vendor/z-worker-pako.js' is denied by the document's Content Security Policy."
04:43:51 <bard66> when trying to flash
04:44:06 <strcat[m]> bard66: sounds like you have broken extensions / antivirus software
04:44:16 <strcat[m]> bard66: open up the web console there and see what the error is
04:44:19 <strcat[m]> copy paste it here
04:44:28 <strcat[m]> try again, copy-paste the few lines of context with the error
04:44:53 <strcat[m]> bard66: the official CLI guide is https://grapheneos.org/install/cli and you shouldn't expect that incorrect unofficial guides will work
04:44:54 <TheJollyRoger> bard66: If it gives you more than three lines, don't copy paste the entire error message or you may trip Freenode's antispam protection system.
04:45:31 <bard66> lol yes I'm following directly from the website .-.
04:45:33 <TheJollyRoger> If it does, you may want to use a paste service, to avoid being klined from freenode by the automated anti-spam bot.
04:45:55 <TheJollyRoger> bard66: the official instructions tell you you will need to use powershell, not to click on the flash all script.
04:45:59 <strcat[m]> bard66: you said you were opening the bat file which isn't what the instructions say to do
04:46:25 <strcat[m]> bard66: use web console to get a more detailed error for us from the web installer
04:46:31 <strcat[m]> as I said, you have broken extensions and/or antivirus software
04:46:53 <strcat[m]> they're injecting code into the site and breaking it since they incorrectly modify the Content-Security-Policy header
04:47:53 <bard66> I used powershell and got errors as well:) ¬†I will try turning off my av and using turning off extensions
04:48:25 <strcat[m]> bard66: you didn't provide that here though, what you said earlier was that doing something not in the guide which can't work (opening the script) wasn't working
04:48:30 <strcat[m]> the CLI install guide works when followed
04:48:39 <strcat[m]> if you improvise or use unofficial guides, it won't work
04:49:30 <bard66> Tried the install guide, and powershell wouldn't flash, tried to follow a recent guide from youtube to see if I was messing up something, didnt work, so came here:) ¬†Will turn stuff off and come back
04:49:33 <bard66> Thanks
04:49:46 <strcat[m]> YouTube guides are nearly all wrong and often dangerous
04:50:06 <strcat[m]> you probably missed a step or something like that with the official guide
04:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> bard66: The youtube guides will usually end you up with a bricked device. You dodged a bullet.
04:50:11 <strcat[m]> would need to see the error to know
04:51:06 <bard66> Unless grapheneos is insanely different install process than any other OS, I was just doing the general steps (following the guide and comparing to google)
04:51:27 <TheJollyRoger> Most of them also tell you to download a shady thirdparty "minimal adb" or installing shady third party drivers. Don't know what they contain, and they also ask you to run the installer as administrator.
04:51:54 <bard66> yeah don't trust random links .-.
04:51:54 <TheJollyRoger> This minimal adb usually won't support autodetection. In some cases it might work, in most others, it usually just flashes the wrong slot and leaves the device unbootable.
04:52:02 <strcat[m]> bard66: it's important to precisely follow the install guide
04:52:11 <strcat[m]> bard66: it's not different from installing the stock OS
04:52:27 <strcat[m]> following the general steps and skipping stuff isn't going to work though
04:52:39 <TheJollyRoger> bard66: you'll want to disregard any other advice anywhere else, and just rely on the official guide. Read it carefully before you begin, in its entirety.
04:52:41 <strcat[m]> you probably missed something like adding the platform-tools directory to `PATH`
04:53:01 <TheJollyRoger> The devil is in the details, and they're all carefully explained there.
04:54:44 <TheJollyRoger> Got to go for a bit.
05:07:16 <bard66> Error: Failed to construct 'Worker': Access to the script at 'https://grapheneos.org/js/fastboot/dist/vendor/z-worker-pako.js' is denied by the document's Content Security Policy.
05:07:26 <bard66> Disabled AV, disabled all extensions, any other ideas?
05:07:49 <bard66> oh yeah error code
05:08:49 <strcat[m]> bard66: open web console
05:08:53 <strcat[m]> show what it outputs there
05:08:58 <strcat[m]> more context
05:09:09 <strcat[m]> it shows the policy that got violated
05:27:04 <bard67> zzz got disconnected, not sure if you responded or not
05:29:55 <sphinx[m]> bard67: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210311#c7212322
05:30:29 <bard67> Oh you didnt see my msg?
05:31:34 <bard67> hmmm switched to brave and seems to be working
05:36:13 <bard67> Yup, worked like a charm....
06:20:33 <manjaroborker> TheJollyRoger: Sorry I'm back now, had to go eat. Now when you say the best phone is the "5", I take it you mean the Google Nexus 5? That's the only 5 I've really heard of before
06:21:56 <manjaroborker> Next question - Is there a supported list of phones somewhere? Looking around on the site, I don't see one readily available. (i assume any phone on such a list would be known to have an unlocked bootloader)
06:24:04 <sphinx[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
06:24:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
06:29:16 <manjaroborker> So no qualms with using a google product? The OS is hardened and more secure, but what about the phone's hardware? Seems like google would be happy to make the entire hardware one big spy machine. Like intel's management engine built into the CPU's.
06:30:44 <manjaroborker> There's also the issues with using 5G. Knowing what I know about it, I want to stay with 4G as long as humanly possible because 5G just makes it super easy for them to invade your privacy.
06:33:28 <strcat[m]> manjaroborker: I suggest reading the information on the siter
06:33:31 <strcat[m]>  * manjaroborker: I suggest reading the information on the site
06:33:35 <strcat[m]> we choose the most private and secure available hardware
06:33:48 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure how you think 5G reduces privacy
06:34:17 <strcat[m]> I suggest finding reliable, trustworthy sources of information
06:36:13 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode exists for attack surface reduction
06:43:18 <manjaroborker> strcat: Do you know much about 5G? It's much easier to determine your exact location within about 3 feet. Often times, you'll be the only one making use of a particular beam. Meaning they know where you are, and when.
06:43:57 <strcat> not at all something specific to 5G
06:44:08 <strcat> and again you can use either LTE and below or LTE only
06:46:07 <nonie689[m]> How can I support grapheneos strcat

07:09:25 <strcat[m]> nonie689: all you've really done is make it so I need to spend 15 minutes closing these
07:13:58 <pizzaeater69[m]> :D
07:14:49 <megan-riley> strcat do you know of any good texting apps for grahene, since the one which comes installed is dated? I was lookng for one besides Signal because there is a large group of elderly folks that I text, and I can't get them to load Signal.
07:15:17 <strcat[m]> doesn't really need to be addressed to me

07:20:30 <strcat[m]> nonie689: we're not really looking for feature requests, there's a lot planned already
07:20:46 <strcat[m]> nonie689: I reworded https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/488 and left it open but I don't really think we want that so it'll probably be closed
07:20:49 <megan-riley> akc3n[m] Thanks. Yes, I noticed that after I had already posted. I'm a n00b, so a little leeway by all would be much appreciated by me.
07:20:55 <strcat[m]> the Bluetooth auto-turn off feature is already planned but has to be cleaned up
07:21:11 <strcat[m]> the rest I think doesn't make sense or isn't wanted
07:21:28 <strcat[m]> what we need are developers to help with implementing the features, including doing projects that we can fund
07:22:39 <pizzaeater69[m]> Im studying software engineering.. I hope im able to help in 1-3 years in actual developing and not just helping people in here
07:25:16 <akc3n[m]> <megan-riley "akc3n Thanks. Yes, I noticed tha"> If you do by chance end up joining the offtopic channel on your irc client, I maybe able to help contribute with answering your question about text messaging. I don't want to clutter up this main channel IMHO with different app suggestions or discussions.
07:57:04 <battlepad[m]> Just flashed GrapheneOS to my new pixel, thanks Daniel and the team for making it so easy via the web installer!
07:57:04 <battlepad[m]> As this is my first custom ROM, I have a few questions to ask
07:57:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy battlepad[m]! What do ye wish to know?
07:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the good ship GrapheneOS!
07:57:57 <rhythm[m]> when we will get system wide dark mode like stock????
07:58:38 <TheJollyRoger> rhythm[m]: Pull Requests and code submissions are open for that, they'll happen when someone adds the functionality to the remaining apps that don't respect dark mode, such as dialer and the contacts app.
07:58:50 <nscnt[m]> rhythm: What do you mean? The system has a dark theme and apps are responsible for themselves.
07:59:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, what nscnt[m] said.
07:59:14 <rhythm[m]> <TheJollyRoger "rhythm: Pull Requests and code s"> calculator
07:59:52 * battlepad[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QHpNYPGoToWHWNYSQxYSLNBb/message.txt >
08:00:04 <rhythm[m]> <nscnt[m] "rhythm: What do you mean? The sy"> pitch black like stock
08:00:19 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m], I'll answer yer questions in order!
08:00:42 <strcat> rhythm[m]: there is a system wide dark mode
08:00:53 <strcat> toggle in the same place
08:01:20 <TheJollyRoger> 1: Yarr, it be perfectly normal for your phone, when running GrapheneOS, to say it be loading a different operating system. THis should happen every time you boot, as long as you are running GrapheneOS. What the phone is telling you, is that it has keys in the secure element that are verifying the authenticity of the system image, but the keys, rather than belong to Google's, belong to someone
08:01:22 <TheJollyRoger> else, in this case, they belong to Daniel Micay.
08:01:42 <battlepad[m]> ahh i see
08:02:13 <TheJollyRoger> You can verify that they are indeed Daniel Micay's keys, by either using Auditor's remote attestation, or local validation if you have another phone that's Android 7.0 or later and can obtain the app from Google App Store, or sideload from Github.
08:02:18 <TheJollyRoger> As for 2:
08:02:21 <battlepad[m]> to add on for question 2 regarding the auditor app, are there any possible alternate solutions for me?
08:02:26 <TheJollyRoger> Yes there are!
08:02:36 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS runs its own in-house attestation server that can do remote pairing.
08:03:01 <TheJollyRoger> In this arrangement, rather than be done over a QR code and a camera, your phone will be instead paired, remotely, via the internet.
08:03:11 <battlepad[m]> Oh so even without a phone that supports the auditor app, I can just use the attenstation server to scan my phone?
08:03:28 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to use a QR code to set up the initial pairing, along with a username, a password, and an E-mail address that supports server to server TLS.
08:03:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
08:03:50 <battlepad[m]> Cool, for an email that supports server to server TLS would protonmail suffice?
08:03:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
08:04:40 <TheJollyRoger> What will happen is that the Attestation Server will expect your phone to contact it periodically to respond to a challenge that it sends. If the phone fails to check in, or it checks in and the responses it gives to the challenges are incorrect, it will dispatch an E-mail to your E-mail address to let you know the phone is failing attestation.
08:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> This allows you to self-monitor your device to ensure that there's no funny business involved: nobody's switched the keys on you, your phone's system image hasn't been altered or compromised by malware, etc.
08:05:43 <nscnt[m]> rhythm: The system dark theme is pitch black
08:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> With the Attestation Server, no news is good news.
08:06:13 <nscnt[m]> If you run the latest release
08:06:36 <TheJollyRoger> You can then log in with your username and password to view your attestation/audit history.
08:06:59 <TheJollyRoger> When the device was asked to attest to the authenticity of its operating system, and what information it returned.
08:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m]: One more thing I forgot to mention with respect to your first question:
08:07:32 <nscnt[m]> rhythm: The dark theme should be the same as stock OS at this point
08:08:45 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that warning screen turns orange and gives you an ominous "Software integrity is not guaranteed" warning do you have to worry. That means that the bootloader's unlocked and all the bootloader security features have been disabled. If you want to take an extra safeguard to prevent that from happening, what you can do is you can go back into developer options, and slide "OEM Unlock"
08:08:46 <TheJollyRoger> back to "Off", then switch off developer options, and reboot the phone.
08:09:34 <TheJollyRoger> This will ensure that if someone wants to unlock your bootloader, if they don't have your password, they will have to factory reset your phone by rebooting to recovery and doing the factory reset from recovery before they can get at that switch again.
08:10:12 <rhythm[m]> i dont have extra phone. how to get auditor server link
08:10:19 <TheJollyRoger> This does add some protection, so it's highly advisable to take that extra step even if it means one extra reboot. No data will be lost in this process.
08:10:34 <TheJollyRoger> rhythm[m]: You'll have to go to https://attestation.app/tutorial and scroll to the part about remote attestation.
08:10:52 <rhythm[m]> <TheJollyRoger "rhythm: You'll have to go to htt"> thnks
08:11:10 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need an E-mail address and a password to talk to the attestion server, and for it to talk to you.
08:11:14 <TheJollyRoger> Don't lose the password, we can't reset it.
08:11:32 <TheJollyRoger> *Don't lose the password, you can't reset it.
08:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> Rrrrgh, come on Freenode Tor Gateway...
08:14:28 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m]: I don't think the default GrapheneOS Keyboard height is adjustable at this point in time. Unfortunately, we don't have many options there, and we recommend that you simply use the GrapheneOS keyboard that the operating system comes with. Other keyboards may not be nearly as trustworthy, and the keyboard sits in an extremely privileged position, given that it handles your passwords
08:14:30 <TheJollyRoger> and personal information.
08:14:44 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m]: do you have any other questions?
08:15:20 <battlepad[m]> noted
08:15:34 <battlepad[m]> that's all my questions for now, thanks for the prompt replies!
08:15:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! Ye be welcome!
08:16:14 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship, if ye find GrapheneOS helpful, please consider donating at https://grapheneos.org/donate - donations keep this ship sailing on its voyage to a more secure and a more private tomorrow!
08:22:20 <battlepad[m]> oh yeah, for the remote verification i made an account, and added an alert email. Then, using the auditor app i used enable remote verification and scanned the QR code on screen
08:22:34 <battlepad[m]> is that all? or did i miss any steps
08:22:43 <battlepad[m]>  * oh yeah, for the remote verification i made an account, and added an alert email and clicked Set configuration. Then, using the auditor app i used enable remote verification and scanned the QR code on screen
08:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m]: nope, that's about it. Your device data should appear in your account in attestation.app.
08:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> You can log in and then go and check it out.
08:25:14 <battlepad[m]> ah, i refreshed the page and scrolled down, saw all the device info
08:25:18 <battlepad[m]> nice
08:25:19 <TheJollyRoger> It will show you a series of things such as "Verified Device Information" which includes your device, the operating system, the operating system version and patch level, the vendor patch level, and boot patch level.
08:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
08:25:40 <TheJollyRoger> Now - verified boot hash will change from time to time. Each time the operating system is updated, that will be different.
08:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> "Security Level" will tell you how secure the attestation is: on Pixels, they use the Strongbox keymaster API, and all the cryptographic operations take place within a physically isolated, secure coprocessor, the Titan M Hardware Security Module.
08:27:42 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor and Attestation Server can audit other devices, but depending on the OEM, some OEMs don't use the same measures. Some use the ARM TrustZone, or other ways of storing the keys.
08:28:16 <strcat[m]> we also haven't been adding other devices lately
08:28:35 <strcat[m]> hardly anyone was using the support we added for more devices
08:28:46 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much sense to invest substantial effort into it while getting nothing back
08:28:50 <TheJollyRoger> Finally, it'll also tell you a bit about the operating system status -- a few things like whether or not you have device administrators, or have debugging features active, since those can have a *big* impact on security.
08:28:53 <strcat[m]> (auditing stock OS on broader range of devices)
08:29:30 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see :(
08:30:49 <battlepad[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Finally, it'll also tell you a b"> Yup, I find these info fields quite useful
08:31:25 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent!
08:32:18 <strcat[m]> the reason it has those is so you have a reliable way of fetching them not requiring trusting the UI on the phone
08:32:22 <strcat[m]> we plan to add more of that
08:41:10 <battlepad[m]> sounds great, looking forward to it
08:41:46 <battlepad[m]> although a small feedback i can add to the remote verification is maybe send an email saying "you've successfully added your device" might be a nice touch
08:42:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. If I recall right, we've got an issue for that open, hopefully we'll be able to get some headway on that soon, since that's a good UI thing to have.
08:43:39 <battlepad[m]> yup, also on the website the wording regarding remote verification was a little unclear so had to ask here
08:43:47 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
08:44:53 <battlepad[m]> perhaps rephrase it to "If you don't have access to another phone that officially supports the auditor app, you can remotely verify your phone from our remote verification service"
08:45:01 <rhythm[m]> fdroid or aurora or foxy - which one shld i use on graphene?
08:45:08 <battlepad[m]> fdroid/aurora
08:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> battlepad[m]: Sure, I'll see what rewording I can send in.
08:45:26 <rhythm[m]> thnks
08:45:35 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off for the night though, so I'll see you guys later. Sleep well, shipmates!
08:45:56 <battlepad[m]> both are good. however from my experience aurora has some hiccups from time to time so go settings > network > enable custom tokenizer
08:46:09 <battlepad[m]> thanks for all the help, good night TheJollyRoger
08:50:34 <rhythm[m]> <battlepad[m] "both are good. however from my e"> what everythng fine fr me. just use nightly
09:03:35 <pizzaeater69[m]> It works most of the time but somethimes have to enable custom tokenizer to get it working

12:00:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> I've downloaded the release, flashed it. but see the bootloader screen
12:00:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> I can run the GrapheneOS only on UNLOCKED bootloader, when I lock it ‚Äî getting android can't find valid operating system

12:06:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> Yeah, I think faced same problem. Restarted installation but it is still on Restarting device state
12:14:55 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound like you're completing flashing
12:15:06 <strcat[m]> you have to complete flashing before you can lock
12:16:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> I think the problem could in in brave, because after I've locked it ‚Äî stupid async promises were resolved and error appeared. Will try the edge now
12:17:30 <strcat[m]> doubt it was a browser issue
12:17:40 <strcat[m]> probably either have a broken USB cable / port
12:17:46 <strcat[m]> or you interrupted the installation process
12:18:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> It was stuck on ` Restarting device ...` state
12:18:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> And just nothing happened
12:20:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> Maybe someone have already installed via web-install and faced same things?
12:20:45 <strcat[m]> the web installer works fine
12:20:50 <strcat[m]> you interrupted the installation
12:21:01 <strcat[m]> it was only just started and needed to finish
12:21:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> so the Restarting device is good state?
12:21:08 <strcat[m]> you can't lock before it finishes
12:21:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> It was stucked for 20 mins
12:21:19 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to restart the device
12:21:23 <strcat[m]> it only takes a few seconds
12:21:26 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier
12:21:31 <strcat[m]> you probably have a faulty USB cable/port
12:21:35 <strcat[m]> it's covered in the guide
12:21:46 <strcat[m]> if you're not using the cable that came with the phone that's very likely the problem
12:22:15 <donkykong[m]> It got stuck for me one time also I refreshed the page and then it loaded
12:22:22 <strcat[m]> there's no reason you need to wait more than 5 seconds without progress
12:22:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> I'm using the original cable with the USB-C port
12:22:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> Ok, thanks, will try smth
12:22:38 <donkykong[m]> Other then that web install has been flawless
12:22:39 <strcat[m]> the port is probably broken then
12:22:47 <strcat[m]> donkykong: again sounds like a USB issue
12:22:54 <strcat[m]> if the USB connection drops it will stall unless it recovers
12:23:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> so in the edge case I can try to replug the usb?
12:23:27 <strcat[m]> the guides cover the importance of having a reliable USB connection and the fact that this is a common (the most common) source of issues
12:23:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> Or it will broke the installation
12:23:52 <strcat[m]> unlikely you can do that
12:23:58 <strcat[m]> you need a reliable USB connection
12:24:08 <strcat[m]> I suggest using a non-broken computer, or at least using a different port
12:24:14 <strcat[m]> read the section it has in prerequisites on USB
12:24:17 <strcat[m]> it's important
12:25:28 <strcat[m]> > Many widely distributed USB cables and hubs are broken and are the most common source of issues for installing GrapheneOS.
12:25:33 <strcat[m]> this applies to USB ports on computers too
12:25:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <v‚Äãovaputin1488> Ok thanks, I'll try. Couldn't it be the problem with drivers also? I have installed official once from google developers
12:25:55 <strcat[m]> often laptops will have some more native USB ports and some that go via a broken hub
12:26:13 <strcat[m]> it's a USB cable/port issue
12:26:25 <strcat[m]> the USB connection is dropping
12:26:40 <strcat[m]> I'd recommend rebooting the computer, booting the phone back to bootloader interface
12:26:43 <strcat[m]> use a better USB port

14:25:33 <entry1[m]> Vlacid
14:26:29 <entry1[m]> Certain apps take a little while for it to recognize once you install. May have to let it load or reboot. If you use GPS apos, I would recommend downloading the maps

16:10:46 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Which specific APIs in Graphene fall under the Sensors permission?  Gyroscope?  Magnetometer? Compass?  Barometer?  Or is it biometric like pedometer?
16:11:11 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Accelerometer?
16:12:13 <mynacol[m]> mr_hebi_san: Anything not covered by an existing permission, e.g. camera, microphone, location
16:12:39 <mynacol[m]> And obviously being some sort of sensor, so everything you named.
16:17:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Hmm... Then how is it that the Angulo and Tri-Angulo apps are able to work with Sensor permission turned off?
16:17:06 <sdk-free-os[m]> Hello
16:17:20 <sdk-free-os[m]> I am new to Graphene
16:17:41 <sdk-free-os[m]> I understand it is only supported by google pixel phones?
16:19:27 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices At this moment, until better hardware can be found.
16:20:04 <TheJollyRoger> Other vendors do not provide adequate support for, or even cripple device security features for operating systems that are not their own.
16:21:47 <sdk-free-os[m]> I see
16:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - I prefer IRC.
16:22:08 <sdk-free-os[m]> would it be possible to remove some non essential hardware from the pixel phone?
16:22:52 <nscnt[m]> Why would you put unessential hardware in a phone?
16:23:10 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: You'll be on your own for that.
16:23:30 <sdk-free-os[m]> No one already tried?
16:23:35 <mr_hebi_san[m]> To be more clear, Anglo and Tri-angulo are apps that entirely rely on sensors to function.  They determine orientation in space.  I don't recall revoking their permissions but their permissions to Sensors are denied...  Yet they both still function and both can access all Sensors
16:24:17 <mr_hebi_san[m]> At least to my knowledge they are accessing them
16:24:23 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: I assume you're talking about the microphones and cameras, and if you're considering that, you're on your own.
16:24:39 <hasnoname[m]> Is there a way to automatically reboot the phone at a specific time?
16:25:09 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: If you're talking about stuff like the GPS and radio processors, you would need to delid the SoC to laser cut the pipelines on it.
16:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: one of these machines would likely cost you several million dollars.
16:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> *to laser cut the pipelines on it, then reseal the chip.
16:25:42 <TheJollyRoger> After which, the chip is likely not going to run for longer than a couple seconds at best.
16:25:44 <sdk-free-os[m]> i think that won't be feasible
16:26:18 <sdk-free-os[m]> does grapheneOS hide hardware identifiers?
16:26:25 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: The devices however, are isolated from host memory via SMMU, meaning they're only capable of accessing host memory that the driver in the kernel allows.
16:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: Please read the FAQ, your question is answered here:
16:26:46 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
16:26:55 <TheJollyRoger> TLDR: hardware identifiers are not accessible to apps.
16:27:04 <sdk-free-os[m]> thanks i'll read that
16:27:04 <nscnt[m]> hasnoname: No there isn't. It's a system app privilege and we don't have an app that schedules automatic reboots other than the Updater when the device is idle (which is at no specific time).
16:27:16 <nscnt[m]>  * hasnoname: No there isn't. It's a system app privilege that is needed and we don't have an app that schedules automatic reboots other than the Updater when the device is idle (which is at no specific time).
16:27:47 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: the FAQ in its entirely is required to participate in this community, I highly recommend it. It's your best source for high-quality answers on GrapheneOS.
16:28:12 <nscnt[m]> I mean... Yes there's a way... Hold down the power button everyday at the same time and tap reboot lol
16:28:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <nscnt[m] "hasnoname: No there isn't. It's "> And that app does not even use READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE
16:28:42 <ModernSlave> Well if you dont mind giving system privilege to an automation app its possible
16:28:44 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> besides that the source code rejects any serial code targeted updates in general
16:28:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I‚Äãickhitterextraordinaire> Turn off the brave shield, that worked for me
16:29:36 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: with respect to removing items like the camera and microphone from your phone, the threat model for that tends to be extremely niche, more niche, and far more narrow than you realize, since removing the microphones doesn't actually prevent the phone from recording audio via reversing polarity on its speakers, or by the phone's sensors. If your phone is compromised that badly,
16:29:38 <TheJollyRoger> then you have bigger problems and shouldn't be using the device at all.
16:30:27 <sdk-free-os[m]> you are right
16:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: so as a result, it might win "Reddit Nerd Credit" or "Opsec Nerd Points" but it's largely performative, theatrical, and gives you no real-world benefit... in addition to *severely* gimping the usability of your device and very likely risking permanently damaging the phone.
16:32:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hardware Kill Switches or disconnectable peripherals are nice, but without an adequate threat model, or the assurance that a compromised device won't simply resume its functionality or for denial of networking capabilities exfiltrate data when you switch them back on.
16:35:03 <TheJollyRoger> Given the choice between scoring Reddit Snowden Credit and Opsec Nerd Points, and having a usable device that I can expect all the functionality of a modern device on, I'll take the latter anyday. Besides, most of the Reddit Snowdens are more concerned about /looking/ secure and showing that off to others, rather than actually /being/ secure, if you catch my drift.
16:37:27 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to hardware identifiers, bit of trivia: Modern apps compiled for modern versions of Android that request the IMEI, your SIM card serial, handset serial, or other hardware identifiers get a "SecurityException" error in response. Apps compiled for older versions of Android simply get a bunch of zeroes. This has been the case ever since Android 10, on all Android handsets.
16:38:12 <sdk-free-os[m]> that is good to know, thank you for helping me out
16:38:25 <sdk-free-os[m]> I just saw it in the FAQ
16:38:31 <TheJollyRoger> Only *legitimate system components* used to negotiate with your cell service carrier have access to those, on a strictly "need-to-know, need-to-function" basis.
16:38:34 <nscnt[m]> TheJollyRoger: "null", not zeros
16:38:46 <nscnt[m]> or well, some placeholder data
16:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> nscnt[m]: are you sure? I thought that that was done for reverse compatibility, for older versions of the API only to prevent the apps from simply crashing or throwing an exception.
16:39:53 <TheJollyRoger> sdk-free-os[m]: yarr, ye be welcome.

16:40:02 <TheJollyRoger> AH!
16:41:01 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see, yeah, you're right, it's null or placeholder data.

17:08:40 <TheJollyRoger> kkm6761[m]: GrapheneOS avoids frills and theatrics, and each mitigation has a specific threat model. What I'm talking about, are people who cannot threat model, and simply do things based on "but it sounded cool" factor, which, our guest had asked about.

18:42:58 <jimbo101aa[m]> My threat model is govt baseband attack via cell provider. Can grapheneos help?
18:44:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> jimbo101aa: you can prevent that attack even on the stock rom
18:44:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> pixel phones have a proper iommu for the radio
18:44:50 <madaidan[m]> What does "baseband attack" even mean
18:45:07 <madaidan[m]> You mean exploiting the code on the baseband? Cell tower triangulation?
18:45:41 <jimbo101aa[m]> I think I mean the former
18:46:31 <madaidan[m]> Pixel devices have decent hardening and an IOMMU to isolate it.
18:46:46 <dazinism> borges: vanadium and other chromium forks don't allow backups.
18:46:58 <jimbo101aa[m]> At least, I am given to understand that cell providers can push code to a mobile device radio
18:47:04 <dazinism> Google uses their own services to backup and sync data between Chrome on different devices
18:47:25 <madaidan[m]> <jimbo101aa[m] "At least, I am given to understa"> Not true.
18:47:56 <dazinism> Sorting out backups for Vanadium is something thats desired, but will take some work.
18:48:16 <dazinism> You can use another app to keep bookmarks
18:48:45 <dazinism> Save links and back that up instead
18:49:01 <jimbo101aa[m]> Thx for replies
18:49:51 <dazinism> Some US carriers can push code to stock Android devices, but that stuff isn't included in GrapheneOS
18:51:01 <dazinism> Why sprint doesn't (didn't?  Think they are due to drop this requirement ) work on GrapheneOS

18:55:08 <dazinism> Older devices also. Pixel 3 got the Titan which is a step up to previous devices
18:55:46 <dazinism> *was the main step up from previous devices
18:58:47 <ManwithArrow[m]> <ManwithArrow[m] "> <@man-with-arrow:matrix.org> A"> Bump? Don't want to be spammy, further discussion would be much appreciated :-)
19:02:19 <dazinism> Man with Arrow: I'd imagine it is likely to be to do with the carrier configurations. There was work done recently to GrapheneOS which would have got this kind of stuff working on many devices
19:02:34 <dazinism> Gave me VoLTE and wificalling
19:03:15 <dazinism> Trouble is theres loads of carriers and, as I understand it, they all set stuff up in different ways
19:03:29 <ManwithArrow[m]> It's a mess, that's for sure.
19:04:44 <ManwithArrow[m]> I've done quite a bit of reading and testing, and this is how I figure it works:
19:04:44 <ManwithArrow[m]> Assuming the carrier's infastructure supports IMS, and your device supports it, *and* your account (i.e.) SIM is flagged as IMS-enabled - it comes down to carrier config.
19:05:04 <dazinism> Think its likely to need someone using that carrier to put the work in to make changes and test
19:06:32 <ManwithArrow[m]> <dazinism "Think its likely to need someone"> The problem is the carrier doesn't support IMS on non-iPhones / Samsung flagships at all. That doesn't mean it doesn't work - I've forcefully enabled (see here: https://gist.github.com/chenshaoju/ec18f2081cb12f85752f4c8259b54b9a) the settings toggles on a Oneplus 3T and it works perfectly.
19:06:39 <dazinism> Then submit a pull request. Either that or keep you fingers crossed that your carriers configs get changed in stock and it starts working for you
19:07:17 <dazinism> (That wasn't a direct reply, but me continuing )
19:07:50 <dazinism> Ideally you'd make your own build with the changes and test
19:10:10 <ManwithArrow[m]> <dazinism "Ideally you'd make your own buil"> Oh definitely, I figured I'd ask here before I did that (it's my main device). Also not sure if it's something the project leads would care for (having the toggles always present in the settings)... It would be a solution, just kinda hacky
19:13:21 <dazinism> Man with Arrow: ah yeah, not sure about the toggle. Guess a change to just enable it for your carrier  may be best.
19:14:18 <dazinism> Think opening an issue to discuss may be the best way to proceed
19:14:35 <ManwithArrow[m]> Much appreciated, I'll do that. Thanks!
