00:01:33 <strcat[m]> fo98: which OS are you on
00:02:24 <strcat[m]> fo98: it's easiest to install on Windows, so if you installed Ubuntu just to install GrapheneOS, you're only making your life harder
00:02:46 <strcat[m]> especially since Debian and Ubuntu have out-of-date packages so you can't simply use the OS packages as would be recommended otherwise
00:03:40 <Essjay[m]> I did it on windows yesterday. It was very straight forward.
00:04:36 <strcat[m]> fo98: you'll need to know how to install a package to follow the instructions on a Linux distribution because that's how we tell people how to get the udev rules
00:04:52 <strcat[m]> and ideally, fastboot, but Debian/Ubuntu package is both broken and horribly (many years) out of date
00:12:15 <XenoProteins12> Thats why the standalone packages are useful =)
00:13:20 <disjunction[m]> I believe the latest version of fastboot can be downloaded here: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
00:14:15 <strcat[m]> the official guide is the only thing people should follow
00:14:19 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
00:14:35 <strcat[m]> if you follow anything else, please ask for support from the person giving you unofficial instructions, not here
00:15:19 <Essjay[m]> <strcat[m] "the official guide is the only t"> The only additional step I needed that wasn't in the guide was downloading the Google USB driver. Otherwise fastboot didn't recognize my 4a. Adb worked fine without it.
00:15:55 <rheaalleen[m]> Same problem with fastboot, same solution
00:16:10 <rheaalleen[m]> Adb works, fastboot somehow not
01:04:33 <nscnt> Google USB drivers are *not* needed
01:04:58 <nscnt> The issue is, that the driver doesn't get updated by normal Windows updates
01:06:25 <nscnt> When you first connect your phone to a Windows 10 computer, you'll get a little link in the Windows Update section to download and install an update for the Android Bootloader Interface
01:06:32 <nscnt> If that's installed, it works
01:06:52 <nscnt> I hope that gets added to the official guide eventually
01:07:53 <nscnt> It's easy to miss the optional update link
01:09:14 <nscnt> The link says "View optional updates" and there you can find the driver update, to be more specific
01:10:37 <brenneke[m]> <nscnt "I hope that gets added to the of"> Careful man....
01:10:54 <nscnt> That would be the preferred way probably
01:35:00 <Liakdeuser[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Iwillpay: pixel 5 is ready alrea"> have a maintainer already for Pixel 5?
01:39:44 <tealopintoscom[m> Is there any way to use swipe keyboard on GOS?
01:40:18 <Liakdeuser[m]> Install a keyboard that supports swiping?
01:41:15 <LinusSexTips[m]> <tealopintoscom[m "Is there any way to use swipe ke"> You can use gboard and disable network access
01:41:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> And iirc AnySoftKeyboard has swiping as well
01:51:02 <tealopintoscom[m> Cool that works well thanks
02:17:12 <the5000[m]> Hey if I install graphene in 30 minutes with powershell can someone help me step by step it's on windows 7 and another thing is I keep getti g an update every day with Android 11 will I still get that on graphene?
02:17:22 <the5000[m]> I mean it's on windows 10
02:17:36 <the5000[m]> I got the update for it it worked
02:19:26 <the5000[m]> There's even another update for Android it's like 180 mb
02:19:32 <Thatcher[m]> Is it possible that a Graphene device with Auditor verify itself, or does the process require two different phones?
02:19:35 <strcat[m]> the5000:  not really clear what you're talking about
02:19:48 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: the whole point is using another device to verify it
02:19:55 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: verified boot is already used to verify itself
02:19:57 <Thatcher[m]> <strcat[m] "Thatcher: the whole point is usi"> Gotcha
02:20:20 <strcat[m]> Auditor would be meaningless without using another device
02:20:39 <strcat[m]> it can be used with https://attestation.app/ for automated remote attestation, not just verifying locally with another phone
02:20:46 <strcat[m]> https://attestation.app/about
02:20:51 <strcat[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial
02:22:08 <Thatcher[m]> Thanks !

02:23:08 <the5000[m]> These updates are happening every day on Android 11
02:24:53 <nscnt> When I got my new phone today, I had like 4 updates in a row on stock Android
02:26:31 <strcat> the5000[m]: the stock OS has *monthly* updates, you probably just started behind if it's a new device
02:26:45 <strcat> they don't release more frequent updates outside of extremely rare, exceptional circumstances
02:26:57 <the5000[m]> Okay I'm going to get them all yes it's back to stock Android so once theyre done I will get graphene
02:27:21 <brenneke[m]> <the5000[m] "These updates are happening ever"> Finish updates and flash GOS.
02:27:31 <strcat> you can do it in a single step by sideloading the latest full over-the-air update for the stock OS but it may be faster to just finish updating with the incrementals now
02:27:47 <the5000[m]> Okay perfect
02:27:54 <strcat> they prefer having you update via incrementals multiple times rather than shipping you a large full update directly to the latest version
02:28:19 <strcat> GrapheneOS always does a direct update: either there's an incremental from the version you're on to the latest release, or it ships a full update
02:28:48 <strcat> that means if you fall behind on updates, it needs a lot of bandwidth to catch up, but it's a lot simpler and more convenient
02:29:06 <the5000[m]> Alright I'll keep restarting after the updates and keep going until there's no more
02:29:25 <strcat> or just sideload the latest full OTA
03:36:15 <evillizzard[m]> can someone help me do a complete walkthrough with installing graphene i already set oem unlocking and became a developer i never used powershell
03:40:35 <evillizzard[m]> i just copy the text into powershell right?
03:40:38 <strcat> evillizzard[m]: start at the top of https://grapheneos.org/install and ask questions about what you don't understand
03:41:05 <evillizzard[m]> im at the first step with curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-windows.zip
03:41:21 <evillizzard[m]> i copy that entire space into powershell
03:41:28 <strcat> yes
03:41:46 <strcat> evillizzard[m]: you'll need to edit the device name to the one for the device you're installing on once you get to the commands referring to a device (unless you happen to be installing on the Pixel 4a)
03:42:04 <evillizzard[m]> im on a pixel 3
03:42:35 <evillizzard[m]> and ive never ran powershell before i just went into the search and it came up with powershell developer tools im in the window now but its not a terminal
03:42:51 <strcat> open up powershell itself
03:43:00 <strcat> search for powershell and open that
03:43:27 <evillizzard[m]> it just brings me to the settinhs every time
03:43:53 <strcat> open powershell, not developer tools
03:45:34 <evillizzard[m]> its not even there i just see the settings its supposed to look like a terminal right
03:46:04 <strcat[m]> you're opening the wrong thing
03:46:10 <evillizzard[m]> how do i even open it
03:46:21 <strcat[m]> are you on Windows 10?
03:46:25 <evillizzard[m]> yes
03:46:40 <strcat[m]> press the windows key, type powershell
03:46:52 <strcat[m]> open Windows PowerShell (1st result), not the stuff further down
03:47:00 <evillizzard[m]> thats what i did
03:47:04 <strcat[m]> try again
03:47:10 <strcat[m]> show a screenshot if that's not what you see there
03:48:43 * evillizzard[m] uploaded an image: powershell.png (1126KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/upyIEqRpCYBySlqVSJbyFswK/powershell.png >
03:52:07 <evillizzard[m]> just search and install windows 10 powershell i thought it came with it
03:52:43 <strcat[m]> Microsoft's own documentation says this:
03:52:45 <strcat[m]> > Windows PowerShell comes installed by default in every Windows, starting with Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
03:52:56 <strcat[m]> evillizzard: is this Windows 10 S, or perhaps a managed work machine, or something like that?
03:53:04 <strcat[m]> seems like it has PowerShell explicitly disabled
03:53:11 <evillizzard[m]> this is windows 10 its a fresh computer
03:53:13 <strcat[m]> it's on every Windows install by default since Windows 7
03:53:20 <evillizzard[m]> it was just booted up 30 minutes ago
03:53:22 <strcat[m]> evillizzard: is it Windows 10 S perhaps?
03:53:27 <evillizzard[m]> yes
03:53:34 <evillizzard[m]> i got that pop up when i started it
03:53:49 <strcat[m]> need to upgrade it from S mode probably
03:54:04 <evillizzard[m]> can i just go to the microsoft site and download it?
03:54:45 <strcat[m]> don't think you need to download anything
03:55:02 <evillizzard[m]> how do i upgrade it i have never been on windows 10 ive never seen this s mode
03:55:15 <strcat[m]> can't really provide support on that here, you'll need to figure that out
03:55:27 <strcat[m]> https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/switching-out-of-s-mode-in-windows-10-4f56d9be-99ec-6983-119f-031bfb28a307
03:56:11 <evillizzard[m]> says its not running in s mode i disabbled it earlier
03:57:16 <strcat[m]> make sure to update with Windows Update and look at what optional updates it offers
03:58:02 <strcat[m]> these are really Windows questions and we aren't equipped to handle those here
03:58:17 <strcat[m]> you should find a support channel for Windows perhaps
03:58:17 <evillizzard[m]> okay
03:58:18 <evillizzard[m]> ill be back when i find out
04:05:04 <evillizzard[m]> okay i am back i have it opened
04:05:49 <evillizzard[m]> so copy the first text in there for windows
04:06:13 <evillizzard[m]> its downloading it now
04:06:57 <evillizzard[m]> upstream revision is the last thing thats on there its done
04:08:16 <evillizzard[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
04:08:20 <evillizzard[m]> this is next to copy right
04:08:30 <louipc> yes
04:08:31 <Essjay[m]> Yes
04:09:12 <evillizzard[m]> next is this fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
04:09:13 <evillizzard[m]> Installed as /home/username/platform-tools/fastboot
04:09:23 <strcat> yeah
04:09:27 <evillizzard[m]> i typed that in there and nothing came up with the last step
04:09:36 <evillizzard[m]> so now plug in the phone
04:09:41 <strcat> no output expected with path
04:09:45 <strcat> did you run fastboot --version?
04:09:49 <strcat> that's showing the expected output
04:10:23 <evillizzard[m]> 30.0.5
04:10:34 <evillizzard[m]> installed as platform tools/fast boot
04:10:41 <strcat[m]> so `fastboot --version` works?
04:10:43 <strcat[m]> make sure you ran that command
04:11:04 <strcat[m]> the block below that is an example of the output
04:11:10 <evillizzard[m]> now its stuck at waiting for any device
04:11:13 <evillizzard[m]> i skipped that step
04:11:19 <strcat[m]> plug in the phone
04:11:21 <strcat[m]> and look in windows update
04:11:30 <strcat[m]> make sure you have all updates including optional ones
04:12:03 <evillizzard[m]> okay im downloading the latest updates
04:12:23 <strcat[m]> there may be an optional update for the fastboot drivers that you need
04:12:41 <strcat[m]> (from Windows Update)
04:12:45 <evillizzard[m]> okay
04:17:20 <evillizzard[m]> after the windows update should i restart the computer
04:20:17 <strcat[m]> shouldn't need to atm
04:20:22 <evillizzard[m]> okay i updated it
04:20:23 <strcat[m]> does fastboot connect now?
04:20:38 <evillizzard[m]> how do i tell if it does
04:21:11 <evillizzard[m]> i have to use the mode where i use the power button and the volume down?
04:21:50 <strcat[m]> yes, on the phone
04:21:58 <strcat[m]> need to boot it into the bootloader menu mode
04:22:38 <evillizzard[m]> every time i do that it comes back ato the normal google screen  it stays there for one second
04:23:41 <strcat[m]> not doing it right
04:23:44 <strcat[m]> turn it off
04:24:05 <strcat[m]> hold power + volume down and hold them, both should be held down, then release power once it boots into the bootloader menu
04:24:12 <strcat[m]> (and release volume down right after)
04:24:39 <evillizzard[m]> okay im in it now
04:25:23 <evillizzard[m]> so now plug the phone in
04:25:53 <strcat[m]> yes
04:26:05 <evillizzard[m]> type fastboot flashing unlock in powershell right
04:26:15 <evillizzard[m]> it still says waiting for any device
04:27:41 <evillizzard[m]> okay i typed it in there and i got a new message on the phone
04:27:54 <evillizzard[m]> saying if you unlock the bootloader you will be ale to install custom os on it
04:27:57 <strcat[m]> you need to use the volume + power button to accept unlocking
04:28:13 <evillizzard[m]> okay so power on unlock the bootloader
04:29:00 <strcat[m]> does it say it's unlocked on that screen now?
04:29:10 <evillizzard[m]> yes in red
04:29:18 <strcat[m]> yes so now move on to the next section
04:29:23 <strcat[m]> obtaining factory images
04:29:48 <evillizzard[m]> type Remove-Item Alias:Curl
04:30:01 <evillizzard[m]> then curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/factory.pub
04:30:15 <strcat[m]> you can skip that since you can't get signify from Microsoft
04:30:37 <evillizzard[m]> where do i go from here if i skip it
04:30:43 <strcat[m]> `curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip` is all you need to run from that section
04:30:51 <strcat[m]> with the appropriate device name
04:31:00 <strcat[m]> crosshatch for Pixel 3 XL, blueline for Pixel 3, etc.
04:31:15 <evillizzard[m]> how do i do that
04:31:22 <evillizzard[m]> i type in curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
04:31:32 <strcat[m]> replace `sunfish` with the appropriate device name
04:31:37 <evillizzard[m]> okay
04:31:40 <strcat[m]> which device are you using
04:31:49 <evillizzard[m]> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/blueline-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
04:31:50 <evillizzard[m]> pixel 3
04:31:52 <strcat[m]> yes
04:31:56 <strcat[m]> so that's for non-XL Pixel 3
04:32:18 <evillizzard[m]> i typed it
04:32:38 <evillizzard[m]> it says supply values for the following parameters:
04:32:39 <evillizzard[m]> uri:
04:32:48 <strcat[m]> you didn't run the curl thing earlier
04:32:51 <strcat[m]> press ctrl-c
04:33:06 <evillizzard[m]> okay
04:33:08 <strcat[m]> you need to run `Remove-Item Alias:Curl` from earlier
04:33:27 <evillizzard[m]> okay i got it
04:33:31 <strcat[m]> then the curl command to download it again
04:33:32 <evillizzard[m]> its downloading
04:33:56 <strcat[m]> so once it finishes you continue on with the flashing factory images section
04:34:22 <evillizzard[m]> okay
04:34:27 <evillizzard[m]> so type cd sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03 once its done
04:34:35 <evillizzard[m]> ./flash-all.bat
04:34:39 <evillizzard[m]> even with the period in it
04:35:21 <strcat[m]> you need the unzip command first
04:35:30 <strcat[m]> and you need to adjust them to blueline
04:35:41 <evillizzard[m]> tar xvf sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
04:35:46 <strcat[m]> yes
04:35:50 <evillizzard[m]> replace it with blueline instead of sunfish
04:36:01 <evillizzard[m]> tar xvf blueline-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
04:36:07 <strcat[m]> yes
04:44:36 <evillizzard[m]> tar xvf blueline-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
04:44:44 <evillizzard[m]> okay it shows some stuff down there
04:44:49 <evillizzard[m]> now from there type in the cd
04:44:53 <strcat[m]> yes
04:45:14 <evillizzard[m]> cd blueline-factory-2020.12.12.03 once its done
04:45:59 <evillizzard[m]> cd blueline-factory-2020.12.12.03
04:46:05 <evillizzard[m]> this one shows red text
04:46:14 <evillizzard[m]> is it normal?
04:47:29 <strcat[m]> did something wrong
04:47:37 <strcat[m]> did you run it once or twice
04:47:59 <evillizzard[m]> i typed in sunfish originally
04:48:05 <evillizzard[m]> then after that typed in blueline
04:48:17 <evillizzard[m]> it showed some files after that
04:48:41 <strcat[m]> talking about the `cd` command
04:49:04 <evillizzard[m]> okay i got it this time
04:49:05 <evillizzard[m]> i changed it
04:49:15 <evillizzard[m]> now flash all with the period in front of it right
04:49:27 <strcat[m]> yes
04:49:57 <strcat[m]> and that should take a while to run, leave it running, don't interrupt it
04:50:14 <evillizzard[m]> wait
04:50:20 <evillizzard[m]> i got the menu
04:50:22 <evillizzard[m]> its in yellow
04:50:29 <evillizzard[m]> fastnbootd graphene os fastboot
04:50:36 <strcat[m]> leave it running
04:50:36 <evillizzard[m]> gives me 4 options
04:50:41 <strcat[m]> don't do anything with that
04:50:43 <evillizzard[m]> okay dont touch it
04:50:46 <strcat[m]> just leave it, watch output on the computer
04:52:16 <evillizzard[m]> okays says finished press any key to exit
04:53:28 <evillizzard[m]> now just press a key?
04:54:41 <strcat[m]> yes and then do `fastboot flashing lock` per the next section
04:55:05 <evillizzard[m]> okay i did
04:55:10 <evillizzard[m]> it said finished
04:55:11 <strcat[m]> and confirm it on the device
04:55:25 <strcat[m]> need to select yes and press power to confirm
04:55:29 <evillizzard[m]> with lock bootloader and hit the power?
04:55:43 <strcat[m]> select lock with volume then hit power to accept
04:55:48 <strcat[m]> then make sure it says LOCKED instead of UNLOCKED
04:55:57 <evillizzard[m]> yes it does
04:56:07 <strcat[m]> now press power with START selected (default) to boot it
04:56:19 <strcat[m]> and it should say "booting another OS" with a yellow icon when booting
04:56:27 <evillizzard[m]> yes
04:56:31 <strcat[m]> k so you're done
04:56:59 <evillizzard[m]> now enable  oem unlocking right
04:57:03 <evillizzard[m]> on the phone
04:57:18 <evillizzard[m]> i can unplug it right
04:59:00 <evillizzard[m]> im on the white screen with the symbol
04:59:10 <evillizzard[m]> i can unplug it from the computer at this point right
05:00:30 <strcat[m]> yes
05:00:40 <strcat[m]> you can disable OEM unlocking now
05:01:04 <evillizzard[m]> alright thanks for hte help and waiting so long
05:26:30 <methodman[m]> Is there anyway to give cash for the lawsuit against GrapheneOS/Daniel Micay? Just prefer that over an online payment if possible.
05:28:16 <strcat[m]> buy Bitcoin or Monero with cash in person and donate it
05:30:01 <methodman[m]> OK
05:37:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> methodman: the only 2 supported payment methods are:
05:37:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bitcoin/monero
05:37:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Paypal
05:37:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> * methodman: the only 2 supported payment methods are:

05:37:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Paypal
05:40:11 <methodman[m]> OK thanks. I'll use one of those methods
05:41:41 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: there are 4: Bitcoin, Monero, PayPal, GitHub Sponsors
05:51:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: hmmm yeah forgot GitHub sponsors
08:50:22 <Thatcher[m]> <evillizzard[m] "alright thanks for hte help and "> Welcome to the club!!!
09:20:07 <thematrix5000[m]> I'm on grapheme now
09:20:35 <thematrix5000[m]> And google sucks
09:31:18 <pumpkineater69[m> <thematrix5000[m] "And google sucks "> Yep
12:43:45 <Thatcher[m]> <thematrix5000[m] "And google sucks "> thematrix5000: hell yeah!
13:16:07 <lovestory[m]> Sorry this might be the wrong place to ask, but are instant apps good or bad? Does it pose any risk for grapheneos
13:18:26 <ayaen_t[m]> theOne:  what do you mean by instant apps ? could you give an example
13:20:33 <lovestory[m]> take_a_deep_breath: can I send a screenshot here?
13:20:48 <somenerd[m]> Add to home screen?
13:21:10 <ayaen_t[m]> maybe thats what they mean
13:21:24 <somenerd[m]> This is a bit offtopic though
13:21:39 <strcat[m]> theOne: we don't have support for instant apps
13:22:01 <strcat[m]> theOne: 'add to home screen' in a browser has nothing to do with instant apps
13:22:02 <lovestory[m]> OK
13:22:35 <strcat[m]> 'add to home screen' is just an alternate way of using a website where it has the UX of an application
13:22:48 <strcat[m]> instead of needing to keep a tab open in the browser
13:22:58 <strcat[m]> it runs in the same browser renderer sandbox, etc.
13:23:13 <somenerd[m]> oh ok
13:23:17 <lovestory[m]> That tells me my flash went wrong.
13:23:27 <strcat[m]> theOne: unsure what you mean by that
13:23:36 <strcat[m]> theOne: what do instant apps have to do with your flash going wrong?
13:23:39 <strcat[m]> very confused now
13:23:40 <lovestory[m]> My settings must be wrong
13:23:51 <strcat[m]> what are you actually talking about?

13:24:04 <lovestory[m]> That
13:24:35 <strcat[m]> it doesn't matter since we don't have support for instant apps
13:25:07 <strcat[m]> you have no way to use an instant app beyond the developer tools / adb
13:25:25 <lovestory[m]> OK thanks
13:28:47 <lovestory[m]> I really don't like pixel 3 XL.. Which pixel device is best for this OS?
13:29:02 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
13:29:36 <strcat[m]> once they're supported, and there's no timeline for that, the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G will be recommended instead of the 4 / 4 XL
13:29:41 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a will remain the recommended budget device
13:29:48 <lovestory[m]> Amazing
13:30:32 <lovestory[m]> Thank you

14:57:57 <nscnt> I'm wondering why the Auditor app has the permission USER_FINGERPRINT declared. Is there a way of locking Auditor and unlocking it with it? I don't see it. Am I missing something?
14:59:05 <nscnt> *USE_FINGERPRINT
15:13:15 <nscnt> I figured it out, even though I'm unsure about the end goal ^_^
15:14:14 <ayaen_t[m]> nscnt:  what is it im curious to know
15:16:28 <nscnt> ayaen_t[m]: You want to check whether at least one fingerprint is enrolled. And what's done with it is something I still try to figure out. There's a lot going on
15:16:29 <harry_mcmerkin[m> 2 questions for phone login-  1) is there way to use a pin for the login, but use fingerprint id for apps after initial phone login?  2) is there a way to enable wiping the phone after X number of failed login attempts?
15:22:46 <nscnt> harry_mcmerkin[m: You'll always need to type in your pin for the inital login. Fingerprint is just a "second" unlock mechanism
15:22:53 <nscnt> harry_mcmerkin[m: Whether you can enable biometric unlocking for an app is up to the app developer
15:26:22 <nscnt> harry_mcmerkin[m: Re: 2). Not that I know of. It's just not recommended. The way it is now, is a good security measure if you use a strong passphrase
15:36:22 <nscnt> ayaen_t[m]: Not sure if that's just to pass the information to the user as "Enrolled fingerprints" is listed, too
15:37:03 <nscnt> ... in the output of the verification
15:38:00 <nscnt> But then I'm not sure why that information would be interesting
16:42:48 <Guest59024> hello
16:43:15 <ayaen_t[m]> hello Guest59024
16:44:10 <Guest59024> reddit told me this is the place to go for help with GrapheneOS, but it's not a forum. Don't know what this is
16:45:30 <Guest59024> Reddit doesn't allow me to post, it directs me here, but I'm just seeing a chat area with 818 people, and no conversation
16:46:56 <ayaen_t[m]> Guest59024:  its just that you came in and its quiet . its a coincidence
16:47:33 <Guest59024> Is there a listing of previous  questions and answers?
16:47:33 <ayaen_t[m]> if you stick around for a while then you will see people come and go
16:48:51 <Guest59024> I see
16:49:13 <ayaen_t[m]> Guest59024:  you can use the search function
16:49:13 <Guest59024> Should I just post a question on here as part of a chat?
16:49:56 <ayaen_t[m]> have you used something like whatsapp telegram?
16:50:16 <Guest59024> I have not
16:50:32 <ayaen_t[m]> no problem
16:50:57 <ayaen_t[m]> just fire away on the text field
16:51:01 <Guest59024> I don't even see a search function, aside from next tto where it says 818 people, which is for searching who's in attendance I believe
16:51:10 <Guest59024> I'll copy what I put in reddit
16:51:15 <Guest59024> I had a hell of a time getting GrapheneOS installed, but after about 7 hours I got it. I ended up getting it installed with the help of driver software on Max Lee's High on Android website. Drivers and stuff that I downloaded from Google and everywhere else just weren't working for some reason. Anyway, now that it's running I was able to start
16:51:15 <Guest59024> installing some apps, but have a few questions.    I noticed that GrapheneOS doesn't include a voicemail app. Do you all just call your voicemail to listen to your messages, or is there a reputable open source app for that?    I followed a webpage that offers some guidance on post installation tips, and installed Signal. Not necessarily for the
16:51:16 <Guest59024> privacy aspect, but rather because I was told it offers functionality in terms of backups, and is also a call and messaging app. After installing it, I went to use it to make a call, but it opens my regular phone messaging app rather than a Signal calling page (is that how it's supposed to work). I'm not set on using signal, but I'm looking for a
16:51:16 <Guest59024> somewhat secure calling app, that can block numbers based on area code (highly important), and possibly offer ability to schedule text messages. (I used to use mood for this in Android, but it's just for text messaging and doesn't allow blocking of calls in tandem nor call/messaging blocking by area code). Does anyone have advice on a safe, secure,
16:51:17 <Guest59024> buglesss app (or separate messaging and call apps) for this functionality?Thank you
16:53:18 <Guest59024> I've got to go out for about a half hour, and can just leave this chat open until I get back I guess. Otherwise I won't know how I'll see answers to it since I don't see the search/find function
16:56:39 <somenerd[m]> >I don't even see a search function, aside from next tto where it says 818 people, which is for searching who's in attendance I believe
16:56:39 <somenerd[m]> You can go on logbot and search there
16:58:28 <somenerd[m]> freenode.logbot.info
17:04:38 <nscnt> Guest59024: Sounds more like a question suited for #grapheneos-offtopic
17:21:50 <dazinism> Splurged on a used ASUS displaylink screen got GrapheneOS on a big screen!
17:23:24 <louipc> cool
17:25:02 * dazinism uploaded an image: IMG_20210101_172337.jpg (127KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/cnryQwfFAIbMmAdKMmCaOXtR/IMG_20210101_172337.jpg >
17:25:33 <dazinism> Works on multiple users (need the displaylink app on each and have to plug/unplug)
17:26:02 <dazinism> Some apps don't allow their screen to be displayed on the external display
17:26:12 <louipc> you use it as a server?
17:27:12 <dazinism> Password store, OTP, also vanadium (and other chromium fork ) incognito tabs
17:27:14 <dazinism> louipc: no
17:27:51 <ayaen_t[m]> niiiiice
17:28:38 <Guest59024> Thanks nscent and somenerd, I see from freenode.logbot.info search that voicemail is a known issue with GrapheneOS, I guess I'll have to wait for a solution. Still glad to be getting away from Google and Apple. Sorry, though, I'm not familiar with this user interface.
17:29:27 <ayaen_t[m]> Guest59024:  its ok.
17:34:18 <Guest59024> By chance, siince my issues with google and apple are more than a privacy thing, and since I just don't want to support them in general, it's still counter intuitive to have to pay Google for a Pixel that they are making money off of. I've tried other options, such as a PinePhone, with all the different supported OSs, but it's not ready to be a DD,
17:34:18 <Guest59024> which led me to the Pixel and Graphene.   I realize GrapheneOS website says supported devices are Pixels, but also see the guy above saying he installed on a ASUS displaylink. Are there phones that aren't manufactured by Google that I could install Graphene on?
17:38:03 <buffmuffin[m]> Graphene Reaps the hardware benefits of the pixel to increase security
17:38:13 <louipc> Guest59024: that's just a screen attached to the phone
17:38:46 <Guest59024> Maybe even through the use of something like QEMU or another emulator to simulate a pixel or other compatible device on a non supported phone?
17:39:02 <Guest59024> buffmuffin, you just answered part of my question after I typed it
17:39:12 <dazinism> Yeah it's just an external screen you attach to via usb
17:39:52 <hasnoname[m]> <Guest59024 "By chance, siince my issues with"> From some statistics I remember seeing in 2019, what Google makes on pixels or their hardware is drop in the ocean. Their main ecosystem is suite of software and data collection and ad serving
17:39:56 <Guest59024> louipc and dazinism, that makes snese
17:40:14 <dazinism> Unfortunately no other android phone maker does as good a job of security as Google does
17:41:11 <dazinism> For a start, very few allow verified boot (an important security feature) for an alternative operating system
17:43:17 <Guest59024> I'm sure most other companies don't have the resources to devote to R&D for security features to the same extent. I understand that, but they still take everything they can from customers for their own benefit
17:43:33 <dazinism> But there is much more. The titan secure enclave. The general quality of coding and care to implement stuff securely is notably sadly deficient from most android device manufacturers
17:44:54 <louipc> relockable bootloader with custom key
17:46:50 <Guest59024> I see it as being like cable companies, you pay them for cable (like you pay for a phone), but that's not enough, because the cable companies then shove greater than 50% of their channels as commercials that they can make money off of, just like google takes your info and capitalizes off it. My concern is less the privacy aspect (it's still some
17:46:50 <Guest59024> concern), but rather fighting against an oligopoly. That's why I also tried out the pinephone and linux operating systems designed for mobile, but too buggy
17:48:50 <Guest59024> Graphene OS is the only OS I've found as an alternative to Android that is functional. I guess I'm stuck with the Pixel for now
17:50:37 <Guest59024> definitely happy with the pixel/graphene combo over IOS and android though. It's a step in the right direction for sure
17:59:31 <louipc> cool. Guest59024 there's also #grapheneos-offtopic channel where people are welcome to chat about other tangential topics not specifically grapheneos
18:01:05 <Guest59024> I just went there and posted to it. Thank you. I have one other question. Is there a channel for the pixel? I mean in terms of hardware?
18:02:10 <louipc> not that I'm aware of. I would guess ##pixel if any
18:02:55 <Guest59024> Thank you louipc
19:17:17 <analtenderloin[m> Heard about the lawsuit, fuck the copperhead team
19:58:06 <donstalkmepls> yeah came here after hearing about this
21:17:04 <bruhbro> Whenever I run the ./flash-all.bat file it just closes immediatley. If I do it in powershell it just says my 'fastboot' is too old. Any solutions?
21:19:52 <louipc> bruhbro: please read the instructions carefully it has all the required steps
21:56:07 <bruhbro> I keep getting prompted with this error "fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html" even though I have fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
22:21:19 <louipc> bruhbro: are you downloading in powershell or browser?
22:22:18 <bruhbro> I have tried both. When I download with powershell I have to go find the .zip file  but its the same version
22:23:00 <bruhbro> I may just try an older version, maybe "newest" version of fastboot is my issue
22:23:04 <louipc> you need to follow the steps and copy paste the commands into the powershell
22:23:24 <louipc> no the version is fine, its just that you need to follow the steps
22:23:32 <louipc> and put the commands all into the same power shell
22:23:42 <louipc> please read the instructions carefully
22:24:49 <bruhbro> Ok. I will attempt to do it all with powershell. Does the command $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path" have an output?
22:24:59 <louipc> no
22:25:08 <bruhbro> Ok
22:26:01 <bruhbro> I am opening up powershell, running as admin, and now pasting fastboot download in
22:28:42 <bruhbro> Ok, it has downloaded, I am not setting the path IN THE SAME powershell. (im just documenting this so if I do something wrong it can be diagnosed)
22:28:54 <bruhbro> now*
22:29:40 <louipc> did you do the verify and extract
22:30:21 <bruhbro> crap, I thought the command did those things for me.
22:30:31 <louipc> theres 3 commands
22:30:48 <louipc> you might have i dunno
22:31:14 <bruhbro> no way those command lines are 3 seperate commands
22:31:22 <bruhbro> ok, lemme try
22:32:53 <bruhbro> fastboot --version is not giving me an output
22:33:10 <louipc> did you do the path
22:33:25 <bruhbro> yes
22:33:26 <bruhbro> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
22:34:00 <bruhbro> the path hasnt changed in the terminal, its still just C:\Windows\system32>
22:34:18 <louipc> sure
22:35:09 <bruhbro> Sure?
22:36:09 <louipc> do dir platform-tools
22:36:11 <jellybelly> Hi everyone, i am using multiple usrrs on my geaphene, but when lockscreen you can see the user icon on the right top of the screen, u can even switch profiles without password ao everyone can see u are using more profiles, is there a way to hide this?
22:37:02 <bruhbro> $env:Path = "$dir\platform-tools;$env:Path"
22:37:04 <bruhbro> like this?
22:37:13 <louipc> no
22:37:27 <louipc> just type: dir platform-tools
22:38:31 <bruhbro> Ok, it looks like that outputed the files in platform-tools
22:38:41 <bruhbro> I dont think it changed it though
22:39:12 <louipc> fastboot --version should work then
22:39:55 <bruhbro> no output :(
22:40:54 <bruhbro> Should I just close the terminal and open powershell in the platform-tools folder instead? resume there?
22:41:17 <louipc> not sure what to say. delete everything. maybe try again in your home folder without administrator
22:41:39 <louipc> maybe you copy pasted something wrong
22:42:05 <bruhbro> ok, round 2, here we go
22:45:18 <bruhbro> ok, so when I open powershell, it doesnt matter what directory I open it in at the beginning? Im gonna do a no admin run
22:45:31 <louipc> no it doesnt
22:45:45 <bruhbro> Ok, opening powershell without admin
22:46:44 <bruhbro> Individually executing fastboot commands
22:47:28 <bruhbro> The file-hash outputs true
22:48:40 <bruhbro> Executed the PATH command. Not looking promising because my directory location idd not change
22:48:57 <louipc> thats fine
22:49:00 <bruhbro> FASTBOOT OUTPUTS!
22:49:05 <bruhbro> SUCCESS
22:49:09 <bruhbro> Next step
22:49:36 <louipc> skip signify
22:49:42 <justanotherlurke> Hi all, happy new year! 😀🎆
22:49:42 <justanotherlurke> My first question in 2021 (and most likely not the last one 😉): Does KDE Connect somehow break GrapheneOS's security features, or would it be safe to install and use to comfortably link phone and PC?
22:49:42 <justanotherlurke> Or what is the recommended way to do that (e.g. for easy file transfer) with GOS?
22:49:47 <bruhbro> My phones boot loader is already unlcoked from a previous attempt, and skipping signify
22:50:15 <bruhbro> Ok, now onto obtaining factory images
22:50:37 <bruhbro> executing Remove-Item Alias:Curl command
22:51:15 <bruhbro> downloading factory.pub
22:52:06 <bruhbro> How do I check the content of factory.pub
22:52:14 <louipc> justanotherlurke: hmm.. looks like the capabilities increase your attack surface, but that's your choice
22:53:16 <bruhbro> nvm, I just did ./factory.pub and opened with notepad. Looks like a match, we are good here
22:53:55 <bruhbro> Ok, downloading the factory image
22:54:41 <justanotherlurke> <louipc "justanotherlurker: hmm.. looks l"> Thanks for your opinion. KDE Connect allows remote access to the phone and its file system. On the other hand, if the client on the phone is sandboxed ...
22:55:06 <louipc> yea i guess you could only give it the permissions you want
22:55:37 * uhzykydori[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/JaTbQoArkiKHjDgHLKSHxcaW/message.txt >
22:55:40 <louipc> anyway its better discussed at #grapheneos-offtopic
22:57:28 <bruhbro> ok, the factory image is finished downloading
22:57:54 <bruhbro> Now flashing the factory image with cd sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03
22:58:15 <louipc> is that what your phone is
22:58:25 <bruhbro> yes, pixel 4a
22:58:43 <louipc> good
22:59:01 <bruhbro> MOMENT OF TRUTH
22:59:06 <bruhbro> it is time to flsh.bat
22:59:20 <louipc> huh
22:59:35 <justanotherlurke> <louipc "anyway its better discussed at #"> OK, sorry ... still not really clear on what questions belong in which channel. Since I asked about breaking GOS security, I thought it was correct here.
22:59:44 <bruhbro> LOUI IT WORKED
23:00:02 <bruhbro> Thnk you!
23:00:30 <louipc> have fun
23:00:37 <Thatcher[m]> bruhbro Welcome to the club!
23:00:39 <bruhbro> :)
23:02:41 <Thatcher[m]> bruhbro now relock the bootloader and disable oem unlocking
23:02:44 <louipc> justanotherlurke: no prob. i think it's more about kdeconnect or how you use it. if you install some app that you give all permissions, thats your choice, its not grapheneos security that was broken
23:03:12 <bruhbro> Thatcher[m] on it!
23:04:41 <louipc> you know what i mean. like you can't go on facebook with grapheneos and post your credit card, then say grapheneos leaked your credit card.
23:13:06 <justanotherlurke> <louipc "justanotherlurker: no prob. i th"> You are right. 👍️
23:41:50 <guest67> howdy, I am trying to flash grapheneOS onto my pixel 3a, but I am stuck for some reason. I got through everything except the last step when I need to run the flash-all command. when I run it it says that fastboot is too old but I am certain that it is not
23:41:55 <guest67> I am on Windows fwiw
23:42:03 <guest67> anybody know why that would happen?
23:42:56 <guest67> I ensured fastboot has the PATH requirement, I tried running as admin, redownloading platform-tools etc. but nothing
23:43:50 <Liakdeuser[m]> <guest67 "I ensured fastboot has the PATH "> You sure you are on Powershell?
23:43:55 <guest67> yeah
23:45:09 <guest67> I tried opening Powershell as admin and cding into the platform-tools directory and then into the image folder, I also tried shift-click opening powershell directly inside and using the comman PATH command on the grapheneOS install page instructions
23:47:48 <guest67> maybe I am following the steps incorrectly? I am in the sargo-factory.... folder (unzipped), which I have in the same folder as the platform-tools folder and I run ./flash-all.bat
23:47:52 <guest67> is that right?
23:49:32 <guest67> 'PowerShell' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
23:49:37 <guest67> that is my exact error message
23:51:13 <louipc> hmm another person had problem as admin too
23:51:17 <louipc> try as non admin
23:55:37 <guest67> no dice
23:55:54 <guest67> thanks though
23:58:50 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be using PowerShell as an admin and improvising your own installation approach in general
23:58:59 <strcat[m]> guest67: delete what you've downloaded
23:59:10 <strcat[m]> guest67: start at the top of https://grapheneos.org/install from scratch
