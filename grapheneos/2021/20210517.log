00:07:29 <vdh7[m]> is there configuration/hardening to me made with vanadium browser or is it good go from start?
00:19:41 <TheJollyRoger> vdh7[m]: It's good to go from the start. Any options you set in Vanadium are likely to reduce your security/privacy, not increase it.
00:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> vdh7[m]: If I could say one thing about how to make the most of GrapheneOS, the most important thing I would have to say about it is simply: "don't try to be a power user." It's been a goal from the start of GrapheneOS that the user should not be burdened with the responsibility of doing a developer's job. As a result, the defaults on GrapheneOS are set for the best security and privacy, and
00:21:38 <TheJollyRoger> trying to "custom tune" them is going to degrade this.
00:22:34 <vdh7[m]> thanks, I see for example that safe browsing is off by default in vanadium
00:23:02 <vdh7[m]> activating it would make me more fingerprint-trackable due to more specific configuration?
00:23:03 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, most people don't realize that by default, Vanadium is actually very closely designed taking into account the hardware and the rest of the software, to mirror the exact appearance of Chrome on the regular Google operating system, so as to maximize your anonymity set.
00:23:37 <TheJollyRoger> Safebrowsing relies on Google, if I recall right.
00:23:58 <TheJollyRoger> So this is one area where it was decided that it would be OK to deviate from the norm.
00:24:08 <vdh7[m]> ah you mean it checks their dns for malicious websites?
00:24:53 <TheJollyRoger> It checks with their safebrowsing service.
00:27:12 <vdh7[m]> but even if vanadium is tweaked as best as possible I would still need other browsers for the purpose of compartimentalization?
00:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to this:
00:28:24 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium is internally sandboxed and uses the memory safety improvements specific to GrapheneOS in order to improve the security characteristics and isolation of the Chromium sandbox. Sites can't steal each others' cookies or information, without breaking the sandbox.

00:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you, @Hulk!
00:29:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it ain't much, but you're always welcome!
00:29:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> o7
00:29:47 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to separate contextual identities, such as if you have one account with my-social-site.com as Alice, and one account with my-social-site.com as Bob, feel free to use another profile,
00:29:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr~
00:30:25 <TheJollyRoger> But on GrapheneOS we don't generally recommend any other browsers.
00:30:49 <TheJollyRoger> They're going to be significantly less secure and Gecko based browsers (such as Firefox) make no effort to internally sandbox on Android.
00:30:54 <TheJollyRoger> As of this time.
00:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> **clarification: one account with my-social-site.com as Alice and another account as Bob, and you want to keep them logged in at the same time, but don't mind them sharing an IP address.
00:34:26 <TheJollyRoger> Have to run for a bit. See you guys later.
00:35:16 <vdh7[m]> my concern was more about the use case of doing like web browsing anonymous stuff on one browser, and doing for example e-commerce on another to prevent being tracked all other the places more than the double logging on the same website with two accounts
00:35:47 <vdh7[m]> but I guess your previous answer explained that I should stick with vanadium  for that?
00:36:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, stick with Vanadium. You can use Incognito mode if you don't want to save history/cookies.
00:37:36 <vdh7[m]> ok thanks
00:37:57 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard!
00:38:21 <surveillexxxx[m]> I actually think that google chrome collects more data while in incognito, just a theory that me and my professors made up though.
00:39:18 <vdh7[m]> I don't know if they collect more but i think I read that it doesn't stop the collecting at all?
00:39:20 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium is not Google Chrome, and does not include any aspects of the downstream Chrome project that would be considered invasive.
00:39:28 <vdh7[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Welcome aboard!"> tx !
00:39:34 <surveillexxxx[m]> oh sorry
00:39:38 <surveillexxxx[m]> I didnt mean it that way
00:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr P.-)
00:39:53 <surveillexxxx[m]> I know its not, I was just saying that out of the blue
00:39:59 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, no problem surveillexxxx[m], I getcha.
00:40:30 <surveillexxxx[m]> I like the private chromium browser because it makes me look like a normie in public
00:40:44 <vdh7[m]> are there features of google that are embedded in the chromium core that you can't remove?
00:40:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, that it does. It even appears that way to the server you're dialing into!
00:42:23 <surveillexxxx[m]> im thinking of putting android hardware inside of the shell of an iphone and making my own android OS that looks like IOS
00:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> vdh7[m]: Chromium in itself actually doesn't contain all that much stuff with Google in it, and all of that can be removed. Most of the invasive stuff is added further downstream when it's packaged and released as Google Chrome.
00:44:57 <TheJollyRoger> For instance, we could hide the toggle for Google Safebrowsing entirely. Would we though? Probably not, there's not much to gain out of hiding it, because it's already off by default and most of our users probably won't be turning it on. Vanadium already removes the stuff that has to do with accounts.
00:47:25 <vdh7[m]> <TheJollyRoger "vdh7: Chromium in itself actuall"> ok understood, thx
00:47:45 <surveillexxxx[m]> anyone here a long time QubesOS user?
00:47:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Some people actually might use it, so... no sense in doing things like hiding that toggle entirely.
00:48:23 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: I am, but QubesOS is not topical to GrapheneOS and you're likely to get better answers from the community at #grapheneos-offtopic.
00:48:39 <surveillexxxx[m]> sorry
00:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> No problem!
00:50:53 <vdh7[m]> I just saw that sensors permissions seems to be by default enabled for all apps?
00:50:56 <vdh7[m]> is that normal?
00:51:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
00:51:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> check faq and usage pages
00:59:39 <vdh7[m]> WebView-based browsers use the hardened Vanadium rendering engine, but they can't offer as much privacy and control due to being limited to the capabilities supported by the WebView widget. For example, they can't provide a setting for toggling sensors access because the feature is fairly new and the WebView WebSettings API doesn't yet include support for it as it does for JavaScript, location, cookies, DOM storage and
00:59:39 <vdh7[m]> other older features. For sensors, the Sensors app permission added by GrapheneOS can be toggled off for the browser app as a whole instead. The WebView sandbox also currently runs every instance within the same sandbox and doesn't support site isolation.

00:59:47 <vdh7[m]> is that what you wanted me to read?
01:00:26 <vdh7[m]> I'm not sure to understand everything.  I should keep sensors permissions to all apps?
01:03:47 <TheJollyRoger>  vdh7[m]: Sensors permissions are enabled for all apps because Sensors and Network toggles for GrapheneOS are specific to GrapheneOs.
01:03:48 <TheJollyRoger> *OS
01:04:07 <TheJollyRoger> So we're breaking compatibility from the Android specification in order to expose them to the user.
01:04:42 <TheJollyRoger> This has the unfortunate side effect of meaning that apps that legitimately do require them to operate and won't function in their absence, have no way to request them in their manifest, without those apps having their manifests being specifically written for GrapheneOS.
01:05:26 <TheJollyRoger> As a result, to keep them from breaking other people's apps, in interim, they're always permitted, however, when apps are first installed, you can turn Network and Sensors off before running them, as the apps are always installed in a stopped state and need to be started by you.
01:07:06 <TheJollyRoger> However, I do not recommend you mess with the Network and Sensors toggles for apps that the operating system comes with or legitimate system apps. This can sometimes cause weird behaviour, which isn't documented at this moment, but for legitimate system apps that GrapheneOS comes with, there is no harm in leaving them enabled.
01:07:23 <TheJollyRoger> Hope this helps!
01:11:17 <vdh7[m]> ok understood, at first I thought it was body sensors because that's what we see in other distributions
01:11:54 <vdh7[m]> but then I saw sensors and body sensors
01:11:58 <vdh7[m]> so I guess it refers to gyroscope, accelerometers and such
01:12:49 <vdh7[m]> I guess I'll play around with the sensor toggle it with apps that I installed
01:13:21 <vdh7[m]> I think I read some papers than said you these sensors can give an awful lot of information?
01:16:38 <TheJollyRoger> You're correct - the sensors are the tilt and gyroscope and motion sensors. If you turn them off, it sets all those to zero and gives the phone the impression it is lying perfectly flat, perfectly level, and perfectly still. You're also correct, in that this can be used for inertial navigation and tracking and to in some ways record fine movement. This is why GrapheneOS allows you to toggle
01:16:39 <TheJollyRoger> them.
01:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> Again, for apps that you've installed, that's not a problem, although note that some apps, namely fitness apps such as apps like pedometers which count the number of steps you walk in a day, or games that use the tilt sensor like Super Tux Kart, will become broken if you do so.
01:17:44 <TheJollyRoger> Since now they're being fed that the phone is perfectly flat, level, and still, not jogging up and down in your pocket.
01:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> Super Tux Kart especially uses the phone's tilt sensor as the steering wheel, so if you deny it sensors, you can't steer, or you'll have to use your finger on the screen to steer, rather than use your phone.
01:19:52 <TheJollyRoger> *rather than use the tilt sensor of your phone.
01:21:21 <TheJollyRoger> But it's definitely nice to have that option, since indeed the tilt, gyroscope, and motion Sensors are capable of being used for much more than just determining the tilt of your phone, with a little bit of clever computer programming.
01:27:38 <vdh7[m]> thanks it's very clear. I'm learning so much, I'm going to call you jollyroger senpai haha
01:28:34 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe P.-)
01:29:45 <TheJollyRoger> Glad I could help you!
01:34:07 <vdh7[m]> I thought firefox was secure until I read the faq
01:35:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's unfortunate, but Firefox never implemented internal sandboxing on Android, it's reliant on the Android sandbox instead, so it takes an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach.
01:36:27 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run for a bit (this time for real!) but I should be back from time to time.
01:36:32 <TheJollyRoger> I'll see you then!
01:36:41 <vdh7[m]> see ya !
01:48:23 <timetravelingman> What's up GrapheneOS Gang
02:32:26 <dimethyltryptami> Hey guys, first off thanks to Micray for the project and making it easily accessible. I have some questions about various apps which only show themselves under specific circumstances, like when using net guard.
02:33:39 <dimethyltryptami> One of the apps which shows up called SetupWizard is for LineageOS. Any idea what its doing there?
02:35:33 <dimethyltryptami> Also, there's a suspect app called 'nobody' whose settings I cannot access. I'm not sure if these are parts of the Grapheme system or im just paranoid.
02:36:27 <dimethyltryptami> Again, can only see these strange apps through 3rd party software like netguard. Should I.be worried?
02:40:01 <surveillexxxx[m]> sonds phishy
02:40:11 <surveillexxxx[m]> you should be able to delete any app
02:57:14 <strcat> dimethyltryptami: you're just misleading yourself
02:57:35 <strcat> Netguard doesn't provide an accurate view of network traffic and nothing about stuff like setup wizard is hidden
02:57:56 <strcat> the base OS is composed out of a lot of app-based components
02:58:03 <strcat> those aren't user-facing apps and you shouldn't be messing with them
02:58:33 <M7777777y[m]> Stuff like setupwizard is also shown in orbot
02:58:41 <M7777777y[m]> Must be some sys app
03:00:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> afaik, setupwizard is an app that you use for the first-set-up of the phone
03:01:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do not mess with system apps
03:04:42 <M7777777y[m]> brb going to sudo rm -R /sys
03:08:59 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <M7777777y[m] "brb going to sudo rm -R /sys"> delete system32
03:10:18 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Salt water significantly increases PC performance, your computer basically sweats and gets cooler so throw salt water on it
03:10:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> :P
03:27:35 <dimethyltryptami> <strcat "those aren't user-facing apps an"> Gotcha. So lineageOS setup wizard is safe and meant to be part of the system?
03:29:05 <dimethyltryptami> Lineage wasn't hidden, the mysterious app "nobody" is hidden
03:31:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's no application called nobody
03:31:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please stop using weird apps like netguard
03:31:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> They are easily bypassed and grapheneos has a far better network toggle anyway
03:32:26 <surveillexxxx[m]> im pretty sure you just got pwned dimethyltryptamiine
03:32:34 <dimethyltryptami> OK. I'm glad to hear its a netguard issue.
03:33:21 <dimethyltryptami> Also, this is a total noob question, as I'm still learning so please bear with me.
03:34:06 <rny[m]> how does netguard even guard when it has no permissions to tamper with iptables
03:39:43 <dimethyltryptami> Is GrapheneOS exploitable or 'hackable'? I chose it was my main driver due to near universal praise for its security (and privacy?) So I'm not too worried but I have to be on edge as the last 2 phone/numbers I had were victims of MITM and possibly IMSI catching hardware. Wont to down that rabbit hole.
03:39:44 <dimethyltryptami> <rny[m] "how does netguard even guard whe"> Unfortunately your knowledge is beyond mine at the moment.
03:43:22 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: GrapheneOS implements exploit mitigations and systemwide hardening. The idea is to make it much more difficult to exploit.
03:43:31 <dnull> rny[m]: My understanding is routes traffic through a local vpn so it can apply rules before forwarding it off
03:43:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dimethyltryptami "Is GrapheneOS exploitable or 'ha"> Networks are not secure
03:43:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should not be trusting networks
03:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to IMSI catchers, we consider that a bikeshed topic; GrapheneOS always considers the network to be hostile, and this is precisely why android apps enforce transport layer security. Some even use pinned certificates to mitigate CA compromise.
03:44:41 <TheJollyRoger> As a result, the security of the network is not a big concern because data sent over it if you use an encrypted messaging application, is encrypted, so the network is distrusted.
03:45:52 <rny> dnull: ah ok
03:46:25 * dimethyltryptami uploaded an image: (160KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pBJxzMSmobZrIPDKsNmBMsyd/Screenshot_20210516-204446.png >
03:46:30 <TheJollyRoger> We've always stressed: calls and texts made to the publicly switched telephone network or use of SMS are security agnostic and are to be avoided, because they need to maintain backwards compatibility to devices and networks that existed before 1986. Avoid them, don't use them. Use an encrypted messaging app, and the security of the network becomes irrelevant.
03:47:05 <surveillexxxx[m]> <dimethyltryptami "Screenshot_20210516-204446.png"> port 9999?????
03:47:09 <surveillexxxx[m]> that sticks out
03:47:23 <surveillexxxx[m]> what have you installed?
03:47:32 <surveillexxxx[m]> did you remember installing this app?
03:47:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> surveillexxxx: moderator warning. You are spreading FUD
03:47:45 <TheJollyRoger> surveillexxxx[m]: it's a netguard issue.
03:47:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Advised to stop
03:47:50 <dimethyltryptami> <anupritaisno1[m] "You should not be trusting netwo"> That's the impression I've been getting.
03:47:52 <surveillexxxx[m]> oh
03:47:56 <surveillexxxx[m]> sorry
03:48:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dimethyltryptami "Screenshot_20210516-204446.png"> The "nobody" you see in this screenshot isn't an app
03:48:38 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: Don't use apps like Netguard. GrapheneOS includes a network permission toggle that is sanely and securely implemented.
03:48:50 <surveillexxxx[m]> I did not know, I apologize with upmost respect TheJollyRoger anupritaisno1 .
03:49:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's a user created and managed by the system
03:49:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> You shouldn't touch it
03:54:29 <dimethyltryptami> <TheJollyRoger "dimethyltryptamiine: Don't use a"> Thank you for the tips. Will be working with the built in components as much as possible.
03:54:56 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: yep, that's how you should do it. The best piece of advice I can give to newcomers to GrapheneOS is simple: "don't attempt to be a power user or sysadmin your phone."
03:56:07 <TheJollyRoger> A core part of the security philosophy held by GrapheneOS is that hardening is something the developers should be doing, defaults should be opinionated, tools should be included in the operating system with a clear threat model, and the system should work as it is delivered; the users shouldn't be saddled with this responsibility.
03:56:53 <TheJollyRoger> Nor should the system present misleading and confusing false positives that make users make bad choices or get mislead, or overwhelmed.
03:59:02 <dimethyltryptami> <anupritaisno1[m] "You should not be trusting netwo"> If you can please elaborate, when you say networks are not secure, does that mean I should be using mobile data instead? Are even private,home networks unreliable? If both those arent the answers, what steps can i take to mitigate or remove all risk? Forgive all the questions as I said earlier I'm a novice.
04:00:34 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: It means you should be using apps that enforce TLS: which means that you should not use apps that were published before ~2010 and have not been updated.
04:00:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dimethyltryptami "If you can please elaborate, whe"> All networks are not secure by design
04:00:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't matter wifi or mobile data or whatever
04:01:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your application should manage all transport/message security
04:01:28 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: the network's job is to move information in the form of packets from one place to another. The job of making sure those packets are secure, is the job of encryption.
04:02:01 <TheJollyRoger> The encryption is done by the application, and the cryptographic libraries included in your phone's operating system.
04:04:43 <TheJollyRoger> I'll explain why this is done: it can take networks, be they wifi, cellular, or even ethernet YEARS to become standardized.
04:04:57 <TheJollyRoger> By the time they're standardized and accepted, any security properties they would have had, would be *years* out of date.
04:05:28 <dimethyltryptami> <anupritaisno1[m] "Your application should manage a"> What does this mean in laymen's terms if it indeed can be translated as such
04:05:29 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, security needs to move quickly. It needs to keep pace with attacks. It needs to be updated, sometimes rapidly. Standards are the reverse of that. Standards are essentially frozen in time.
04:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: It means you need to keep your apps up to date.
04:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> In the most basic terms.
04:06:53 <dimethyltryptami> <TheJollyRoger "By the time they're standardized"> OK that makes sense
04:07:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If we try to build security into the network, by the time the network is in use, we will have built in broken security because it'll be a decade out of date.
04:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> So it's better that the network be built and be *treated as* being agnostic of security, and then build secure channels within it.
04:08:15 <TheJollyRoger> dimethyltryptami: Around ~2010 or so, if I recall correctly, Google made using Transport Layer Security encryption mandatory for apps on Android. This means that any apps on your phone that dial out to reach their server backends must do so securely by first establishing an encrypted channel between your phone, and the server it's trying to reach.
04:08:42 <TheJollyRoger> So even if someone is in control of the network, it doesn't matter. All that traffic is encrypted anyways.
04:09:24 <TheJollyRoger> There are three exceptions to this: SMS, calls to the publicly switched telephone network, and plaintext websites that haven't been updated since the 1990's.
04:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> In the latter's case of plaintext websites that haven't been updated since the 1990's (or at least, are running insecurely), Vanadium will display a big fat "NOT SECURE!" warning at the top of the screen which can't be hidden.
04:11:09 <TheJollyRoger> In the case of calls to the publicly switched telephone network, or SMS, remember that both of these are security agnostic protocols that need to remain backwards compatible to in some cases, rotary telephones that were around before the internet.
04:11:30 <dimethyltryptami> <TheJollyRoger "dimethyltryptamiine: It means yo"> Thank you. Last q for the night, are there resources /websites that have mainly encryption enabled apps etc? And if all networks are a liability, what are my options other than home surfing or carrier level data use/since both aren't secure. If I understand correctly
04:11:45 <TheJollyRoger> The mitigation for this vector: ask your contacts to use an encrypted messaging app.
04:12:11 <dimethyltryptami> <TheJollyRoger "The mitigation for this vector: "> Gotcha
04:12:53 <dimethyltryptami> Thanks for the help tonight
04:13:09 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to encryption enabled: over 99% of the internet uses encryption now. The only websites you'll find that don't use encryption are ones that are being delisted from search engines for being insecure. All Android applications made since the early '10s *must* use at least transit layer encryption, even if they don't put on a song and dance for you, or they're violating the
04:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> specification.
04:13:48 <TheJollyRoger> If you visit a plaintext site, in any modern browser, you'll likely see a gray icon of a broken lock at the top of the screen in the URL bar with copious amounts of "NOT SECURE" warnings.
04:14:23 <TheJollyRoger> Now... it's important to note the limitations of Transit Layer Security (Transit Encryption).
04:15:37 <TheJollyRoger> But that's another discussion, for another topic, for another day.
04:15:46 <TheJollyRoger> I hope this helps you a little bit!
04:16:48 <TheJollyRoger> *clarification even if they don't put on a song and dance for you to show some visual indicator that they're using transport layer security/transit layer encryption
04:53:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dimethyltryptami "What does this mean in laymen's "> It means that your application needs to ensure security and authenticity of the received data
04:53:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> This can be done through TLS, MLS or whatever the application wants to use
04:53:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe confidentiality or security isn't necessary
04:54:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> The application should be able to omit it in that case
04:54:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> And only use authenticity
04:54:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or whatever
06:42:20 <nscnt[m]> TheJollyRoger: I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but to my knowledge a secure connection is not a must for an app. It's only disabled by default, but can be enabled by the app developer
06:42:32 <nscnt[m]> TheJollyRoger: You can see Updater opting out of clear text explicitly at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/blob/11/res/xml/network_security_config.xml
06:42:44 <nscnt[m]> but just flipping it, allows clear text
06:43:28 <nscnt[m]>  * TheJollyRoger: I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but to my knowledge a secure connection is not a must for an app. Secure connection is only enabled by default, but can be disabled by the app developer
07:38:20 <strcat[m]> nscnt: that predates the status quo
07:38:34 <strcat[m]> clear text traffic is disabled by default now
07:38:42 <strcat[m]> just didn't remove that file since it's useful if someone wants to pin TLS keys
07:39:05 <strcat[m]> anyway it forbids clear text traffic by checking in the APIs
07:39:26 <strcat[m]> if you just use lower level network access / your own libraries for it then of course it works fine
07:39:33 <strcat[m]> it's a runtime lint check, basically
07:39:46 <strcat[m]> you can choose to disable it or use other network libraries
07:39:48 <strcat[m]> without the checks
07:40:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't stop you opening a socket in C and sending data
07:40:17 <strcat[m]> it only stops you using high-level Java APIs to do unencrypted network traffic
07:40:41 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to expose a toggle for forcing it enabled but of course the app can just do it another way
07:40:58 <strcat[m]> and nothing stops the app using encrypted connections insecurely like disabling cert validation, using certs with publicly known keys, etc.
07:41:04 <strcat[m]> using legacy TLS
08:54:58 <yodawins[m]> I still have a bad feeling about printing services. Like it is possible to exfiltration data, could be vuln, etc, etc.
08:54:59 <yodawins[m]> Good security practies should be turn off services which is not in use. Like you dont keep ports open if you dont really need it.
08:56:29 <yodawins[m]> With that said, Im not a power user.
09:04:48 <strcat[m]> yodawins: I think you're greatly misunderstanding what it is
09:04:52 <strcat[m]> and what you're saying doesn't make sense
09:05:03 <strcat[m]> why are you so focused on this specific thing? what is it you think that provides / does? it's not a server
09:06:50 <strcat[m]> is it really a problem for you that the OS has infrastructure to support printing? if you'd like we can just stop listing OS components in Settings
09:12:29 <somenerd[m]> >I still have a bad feeling about printing services. Like it is possible to exfiltration data, could be vuln, etc, etc.
09:12:29 <somenerd[m]> How is this related?
11:28:08 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.05.16.04 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.05.16.04
11:28:19 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1394239303610478595
11:28:24 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/nedovx/grapheneos_2021051604_release/
11:34:56 <Tom47> Hi after some help with a new grapheneos install, mobile network is greyed out
11:35:02 <sphinx[m]>  > (also as as the Google Play system update version)
11:35:19 <sphinx[m]> "as" is repeated?
11:36:21 <alex-resist> New release is installing
11:36:37 <alex-resist> Unsure about the gesture navigation, but I don't think this change affects existing users?
11:40:59 <Julian11> Heelo guys i want to contribute to project but i dont know where to start ?
11:41:04 <Julian11> Any help?
11:42:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!.> Try the issue tracker: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues
11:42:48 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it does, decided to just change the default, so if you've never changed the setting, it will change
11:42:51 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I decided it's fine to do that and it's the simplest approach
11:43:09 <Julian11> Okay but also i lack some background information is there any documentation about AOSP or Grapheneos?
11:43:12 <strcat[m]> it's painful to do it another way and I don't think "hasn't changed setting" is equivalent to "prefers legacy 2-button mode"
11:43:46 <strcat[m]> Julian11: https://grapheneos.org/contact#reporting-issues (to get an idea of which features need to be worked on), https://grapheneos.org/build etc.
11:44:28 <Julian11> Thanks i really want to improve myself and also make an improvement in project. Thanks again.
11:44:44 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues covers most stuff
11:45:11 <alex-resist> strcat I've been using 3 button mode and it hasn't changed after the update
11:45:26 <strcat[m]> it's not supposed to change
11:45:31 <strcat[m]> only the default is changed
11:45:33 <alex-resist> So it only changes when someone is on default?
11:45:35 <alex-resist> I see, ok
11:45:37 <strcat[m]> i.e. if you've never changed it
11:45:38 <strcat[m]> yes
11:45:50 <strcat[m]> default was 2-button mode
11:46:04 <strcat[m]> if someone toggled it to gesture mode and back to 2-button mode they are explicitly set to use 2-button mode, this update won't change their navigation mode
11:46:14 <strcat[m]> it only changes it for users with no user configured preference, i.e. actually using the default
11:46:26 <strcat[m]> by using the default I mean no user configuration, not 'using 2-button mode'
11:46:32 <alex-resist> Tbf I only know people who use the oldschool 3 button mode
11:46:40 <alex-resist> Perhaps I should try gestures
11:46:44 <strcat[m]> most people are using 2-button mode because we had it as the default (which will change) not because they explicitly wanted to use it
11:46:49 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: gestures are pretty much strictly better
11:46:54 <strcat[m]> I gave instructions in the release notes
11:47:18 <strcat[m]> you get more screen real estate and easier switching between apps (just swipe left to go to previous, no need to open app overview)
11:48:18 <strcat[m]> it's a minor improvement and isn't really that much different than 2-button just gets rid of the remaining 2 buttons (become gestures), switches the app overview gesture (which is rarely actually wanted) and adds ability to switch apps without opening app overview or going home
11:48:56 <strcat[m]> want to match what the stock OS has particularly since they don't even have 2-button mode anymore, just 3-button and gesture
11:49:29 <strcat[m]> we had to patch SystemUI to add global menu action for screenshot to 2-button mode like they do for 3-button and I don't want to deal with that kind of thing in the future
11:49:47 <alex-resist> Gestures seems already better than 2 button mode, I think that's the one I disliked most
11:50:34 <strcat[m]> 2 button was just meant to be a step towards gesture mode
11:50:50 <strcat[m]> it didn't go far enough and failed to really be a good middle ground to get people used to it
11:51:11 <strcat[m]> especially since the home gesture in full gesture mode is swipe up, not app overview
11:51:52 <strcat[m]> does anyone here happen to have access to latest macOS + Safari and ~15 minutes to help me test something?
11:52:22 <alex-resist> I think I was missing the swipe up + hold gesture. Will try to get used to it
11:52:40 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you mostly just need swipe left (and right) on the nav bar
11:53:01 <strcat[m]> also worth noting there's still reserved space for touches at the bottom, it's just transparent
11:53:32 <strcat[m]> (depends on app API level, older apps have some reserved space they can't display in to work around them not being able to cope)
11:54:01 <alex-resist> I know this is pure AOSP but is there a "return to last app" gesture?
11:54:04 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: current app is always on furthest right and each step left is 1 step further back in history
11:54:11 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: single swipe left is always return to last app
11:54:14 <alex-resist> I see
11:54:20 <alex-resist> I think I will give it a try
11:54:22 <strcat[m]> it's a more modern app overview screen
11:54:27 <strcat[m]> not the same as 2/3-button
11:54:32 <strcat[m]> always ordered by time of use
11:54:57 <strcat[m]> and if you don't want to use the awkward screenshot key chord, the button for that is in recent apps menu, not the global menu
11:55:35 <strcat[m]> stock OS launcher also has OCR for text selection in images, videos, etc. there but sadly that uses a Play services API so it isn't in the AOSP launcher
11:55:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> strcat[m]: i can help, i have mac and safari
11:55:57 <strcat[m]> great
11:56:20 <strcat[m]> first step can you navigate to https://grapheneos.org/ and bookmark it and I assume they use the favicon.ico next to the bookmark
11:56:31 <strcat[m]> and also if you click on the URL bar, I think it shows the favicon
11:56:43 <strcat[m]> just need to first of all confirm it shows it in both places, then need to try some things
11:57:47 <strcat[m]> you can tell it's the favicon.ico because it's black on transparent background (and relatively low res, 64x64 maximum)
11:58:07 <strcat[m]> apple touch icon is black on white and quite high res
11:58:23 <strcat[m]> favicon.svg (Safari doesn't support it) is black on transparent or white on transparent depending on dark mode
11:59:46 <strcat[m]> if I delete favicon.ico from the html, Chromium will use the SVG, and then the dark mode switch works, but Safari doesn't support SVG and seems to not fetch the ICO if SVG is listed but ICO isn't
11:59:56 <strcat[m]> so I want to try setting a Link header for Safari telling it about the ICO
11:59:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i confirm that when clicking on a URL bar, i can see the favicon (black with white background)
12:00:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in the "Add Bookmark" dialog there there is no favicon
12:01:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> when I later navigate though the bookmark list, the favicon is visible
12:02:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this was tested in a light moce so far, switching to dark mode now
12:04:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i confirm that when clicking on a URL bar, i can see the favicon (black with transparent background)
12:04:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (note that: because of dark background due to dark mode, it is barely visible)
12:06:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in the "Add Boorkmark" dialog there is no favicon
12:06:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> when I later navigate through the bookmark list, the favicon is there (black on transparent background)
12:07:33 <strcat[m]> ok going to remove it from html on a page now
12:07:37 <nscnt[m]> It's black on white for me in the bookmarks when in dark mode
12:07:55 <strcat[m]> if it's black on white there they either do that themselves or they use the apple touch icon
12:08:17 <Tom61> hi I have no mobile network on Grapheneos and option is greyed out, any help?
12:08:31 <strcat[m]> apple touch icon is black logo on white background and is like 180x180 or something
12:08:32 <strcat[m]> forget
12:08:40 <strcat[m]> normal favicon.ico is transparent bg
12:08:47 <strcat[m]> just black
12:08:54 <strcat[m]> anyway one sec
12:10:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nscnt[m]: it is black with white background for me in the bookmarks sidebar
12:10:33 <strcat[m]> if it's always black on pure white there they probably use apple touch icon which is good
12:10:38 <strcat[m]> ideally they wouldn't use favicon.ico at all
12:10:57 <strcat[m]> ok now try with https://staging.grapheneos.org/
12:11:03 <strcat[m]> I've removed favicon.ico from the HTML there
12:11:11 <nscnt[m]> I think it's transparent in the bookmarks when in light mode
12:11:12 <strcat[m]> try same thing with that (nav bar and bookmark)
12:11:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nscnt[m]: but it is black with transparent background in the Bookmarks top menu
12:11:26 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they might add the white bg themselves
12:11:30 <strcat[m]> try the staging site now
12:11:32 <strcat[m]> it will make it clearer
12:11:57 <nscnt[m]> No changes. Same behavior on staging
12:12:23 <strcat[m]> interesting
12:12:23 <strcat[m]> sec
12:12:51 <strcat[m]> nscnt: can you spam f5 refresh it
12:13:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i confirm, the same behaviour
12:13:01 <strcat[m]> (or whatever their force refresh is)
12:13:14 <strcat[m]> or uhhh open in private browsing
12:13:18 <strcat[m]> just want to see what it requests
12:14:30 <strcat[m]> hmm
12:14:38 <strcat[m]> I wonder if they just use their mask icon
12:15:01 <strcat[m]> cause it's not asking for favicon.ico, that's for sure
12:15:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (in the private browsing, due to even darker URL background, the icon is almost invisible)
12:15:26 <nscnt[m]> It's black on white in the tabs favicon as well in dark mode
12:15:30 <strcat[m]> for staging.grapheneos.org?
12:15:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh yeah, that's true
12:16:08 <nscnt[m]> The URL icon is always black on transparent
12:16:19 <strcat[m]> the pinned tab icon is mask-icon.svg for sure, not favicon.ico or apple touch icon
12:16:25 <strcat[m]> they have a special standard for that which we deal with
12:16:31 <strcat[m]> and we get to choose the color + provide mask
12:16:43 <strcat[m]> it's that mask-icon.svg thing
12:16:51 <strcat[m]> that's why it was added in the first place, stupid safari NIH thing
12:17:15 <strcat[m]> so the main thing is on staging.grapheneos.org right now, it still shows icons for bookmarks, nav bar, etc.?
12:17:22 <strcat[m]> not just some generic globe or something?
12:17:50 <nscnt[m]> Still works
12:18:02 <strcat[m]> I can probably just ship removing favicon.ico from the html then
12:18:16 <strcat[m]> I guess I could set the icon to red for staging to figure out which it is using
12:18:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, it still shows icons
12:18:25 <strcat[m]> sec
12:18:31 <strcat[m]> setting mask icon to red there
12:19:59 <strcat[m]> Tom61: you probably just need to try using different APNs, etc.
12:20:09 <strcat[m]> try now
12:20:12 <strcat[m]> should be red in some cases now
12:20:21 <strcat[m]> fresh private browsing best to avoid cache
12:20:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nope, it stayed the same
12:20:48 <strcat[m]> look at tab icon?
12:20:52 <strcat[m]> in fresh private browsing
12:20:59 <strcat[m]> that should be red
12:21:06 <strcat[m]> it might have a cache for bookmarks I guess
12:21:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh actually, the tab icon did change
12:21:17 <strcat[m]> try a new page
12:21:19 <strcat[m]> that's red now right?
12:21:32 <strcat[m]> now can try to figure out what it's using because /mask-icon.svg is red
12:21:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but URL and Bookmarks it's still black
12:21:46 <strcat[m]>  /favicon.ico is still black + transparent, apple touch icon is black on white
12:21:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in Tabs it uses red
12:21:52 <strcat[m]> I will try making the touch icon blue
12:21:53 <strcat[m]> lol
12:21:58 <strcat[m]> I really want to know wtf it's doing
12:22:19 <strcat[m]> there's stuff like https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_compatibility but it's incomplete + it's about the specific output of that site
12:22:34 <strcat[m]> and that's not what we are doing + we cannot do it because we want svg favicon as main since svg can change color based on dark mode
12:22:43 <strcat[m]> hate favicons
12:22:52 <strcat[m]> there are all these browsers, and each uses different ones, in different ways
12:22:59 <strcat[m]> and then different bots / crawlers use stuff
12:23:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so just to elaborate, in the Tabs i can see the logo being read with white background
12:23:56 <strcat[m]> favicon itself (can be ico, png, svg, etc.), mask icon (mostly a Safari tab icon thing afaik), Open Graph images, web manifest icons of various kinds, web manifest mask icon, apple touch icons of various sizes and precomposed vs. normal, and other things
12:23:57 <strcat[m]> such a pain
12:24:14 <strcat[m]> anyways let me try next thing
12:27:22 <strcat[m]> okay I made the apple touch icon blue, and mask icon is still red, favicon is black/transparent
12:27:27 <strcat[m]> try now in fresh private window
12:28:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no valid icon in URL bar
12:28:46 <nscnt[m]> For the non-staging
12:28:57 <strcat[m]> just try staging
12:29:01 <nscnt[m]> Staging hasn't changed
12:29:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> staging, no valid icon in URL to be precise
12:29:41 <nscnt[m]> Mask icon in URL, favicon in URL, Black on transparent in bookmarks
12:29:54 <nscnt[m]> Uhm
12:29:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> staging, red with white background in Tabs
12:30:06 <nscnt[m]> Black on white in bookmarks
12:30:34 <nscnt[m]> So favicom with white background?
12:31:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> staging, no valid icon (just a placeholder) in URL and Bookmarks menu
12:31:43 <nscnt[m]> Staging works for me
12:32:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but did you clear all the history and data?
12:33:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nscnt[m]: to check that everything is cleared properly,you can try turning off wifi, clearing everything, and then when you open safari, you will not see icons of popular websites, just the first letters
12:36:16 <strcat[m]> mobile Chromium uses mix of the favicon and apple touch icon, in a reasonable way
12:36:24 <strcat[m]> will work really nicely if I can get rid of the favicon.ico in html
12:36:30 <strcat[m]> it's just safari that's really dumb
12:36:55 <strcat[m]> so far it matches my expectations: Safari uses mask icon for tab (red) and doesn't use touch icon on desktop (blue)
12:37:42 <strcat[m]> mobile Chromium uses favicon (full svg support so changes based on dark mode - although it's not smart enough to render it again immediately after switching mode) and apple touch icon for some things
12:37:53 <nfp[m]> Hello, I am using a Pixel 3 and I have a very problematic bug since about two weeks or so. Sometimes when I push the power button for a moment the camera opens instead and when I close the camera the phone shuts down and then tries to reboot douzens of times. Its in a reboot loop between the black screen with the warning sign and the google logo and always switches inbetween them without me doing anything.
12:38:14 <strcat[m]> it sounds like your power switch is messed up and sending multiple clicks repeatedly
12:38:19 <strcat[m]> like a screwed up connection
12:38:23 <strcat[m]> camera opens on double tapping power
12:39:32 <nfp[m]> <strcat[m] "it sounds like your power switch"> oh no, makes sense.
12:39:46 <strcat[m]> interestingly the way Chromium works on mobile, if favicon.ico is not in the HTML, it uses apple touch icon in the URL bar list
12:39:53 <strcat[m]>  * interestingly the way Chromium works on mobile, if favicon.ico is in the HTML, it uses apple touch icon in the URL bar list
12:40:07 <strcat[m]> if favicon.ico is NOT in the HTML, it uses favicon.svg (because it satisfies any size request)
12:40:51 <strcat[m]> so it's kinda funny: it never uses favicon.ico in nav bar, but whether it's present in the html changes what it does use there (because it only downloads favicon.svg if there's no ico)
12:41:49 <strcat[m]> https://paste.xinu.at/Yag/ can see the difference here
12:42:38 <strcat[m]> i.e. it's using apple touch icon for grapheneos.org (because favicon.ico is in html so it never downloads favicon.svg) but it downloads favicon.svg for staging (since ico isn't in html) therefore it gets to use the svg (which changes based on dark mode and is always transparent bg)
12:42:50 <strcat[m]> why are browsers so complicated?
12:44:18 <nscnt[m]> That's why I decided to use weird CSS filters to change the logo color ^^
12:44:22 <strcat[m]> tab groups look really bad with the favicon.svg though
12:44:36 <strcat[m]> unfortunate
12:44:38 <strcat[m]> it always shows them on black bg
12:44:53 <strcat[m]>  * it always shows them on white bg
12:51:47 <floralshoppe[m]1> could someone please eli5 what makes vanadium so private.
12:54:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> floralshoppe[m]1: please read the logs
13:00:04 <strcat[m]> nscnt: can you check staging again, the icon should be missing in nav bar / bookmark atm
13:00:10 <strcat[m]> unsure what to do to work around this tbh
13:00:16 <strcat[m]> and then this annoying tab group thing
13:01:39 <nscnt[m]> strcat: Non-staging?
13:01:45 <strcat[m]> no
13:01:46 <strcat[m]> staging only
13:03:32 <strcat[m]> anyway trying something else
13:05:20 <nscnt[m]> <strcat[m] "nscnt: can you check staging aga"> Yes, it's missing
13:12:47 <Joshua71> I am trying to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 5, but I can't unlock the bootloader because I think my laptop does not recognize my device when it's on the fastboot screen
13:13:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Joshua71: hello
13:13:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> does your laptop come with USB-C port?
13:13:40 <Joshua71> Yes it does
13:14:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which OS, browser are you using?
13:14:26 <Joshua71> Windows 10 and Brave. I tried Ungoogled Chromium as well without sucess
13:14:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> don't use neither of them
13:14:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> use Edge
13:15:03 <Joshua71> I will try, I'll let you know if it works
13:15:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do you use any third-party programs/scripts to modify Windows?
13:15:48 <Joshua71> I do use W10 privacy
13:16:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this might be causing issues
13:16:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Joshua71: do you have another Android phone with USB-C port?
13:16:34 <Joshua71> Edge didn't work either
13:16:48 <Joshua71> No I don't have anoter device with a USB-C port
13:17:13 <Joshua71> I think it's mainly a driver isssue, since it does not recognize my phone as a phone
13:17:20 <Joshua71> Could that be it?
13:17:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, so you're either missing a driver or you've modified Windows too much
13:17:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is your phone in bootloader interface?
13:17:47 <Joshua71> Yes probably, I am not so technical so I could be wrong
13:17:52 <Joshua71> Yes it is
13:18:01 <southron[m]> On a couple PC's I had to check Windows update-->optional updates while it was plugged in to get it recognized.
13:18:26 <southron[m]> And install ADB drivers.
13:18:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read this https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
13:18:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do NOT install adb
13:18:58 <Joshua71> There are quite a few drivers by the Windows update section, I will give it a shot
13:19:48 <Joshua71> I didn't read that part, that is probably it
13:20:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Joshua71: before proceeding
13:21:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> please read the WHOLE guide TWICE
13:22:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (when I was doing it the first time, I re-read it 4 times)
13:22:31 <southron[m]> Is there a problem installing the drivers that are listed in Windows updates? That's the only way I could one phone to to be recognized.
13:23:01 <nscnt[m]> southron: No. It's written in the guide to do it
13:23:09 <nscnt[m]> It's needed for a lot of users
13:23:15 <southron[m]> Gotcha.
13:26:00 <DemiMarie> <akc3n[m] "I know I didn't really answer yo"> That’s fine 🙂.  Right now, the biggest limitation of GrapheneOS is that I can’t install any third-party apps on it without nasty bootstrapping security problems (of the form “how do I get that key?”)
13:33:51 <strcat[m]> we'll have a first party repo eventually
13:33:52 <strcat[m]> just not implemented yet
13:45:31 <TheExplorer[m]> Hi everyone, I have a pixel 4a 5G and would like to get grapheneOS on it (I still never used the phone btw, coming from crDroid on a poco f1). The only thing that was making me a bit reluctant was the camera app, and then I found this : https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
13:45:32 <TheExplorer[m]> I wanted to know if some of you were using it and what you were thinking about it !
13:46:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> some GrapheneOS users do use it
13:46:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> seems to work currently
13:46:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is however unknown how long this would work
13:47:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> one day Google may make their Gcam app to rely more on Google Play Services
13:47:42 <makingaliasesisa> nice strcat
13:47:57 <strcat[m]> nscnt: trying a horrible hack
13:48:25 <strcat[m]> some browsers happily accept other image types for /favicon.ico
13:48:31 <strcat[m]> they say so in accept header
13:48:40 <strcat[m]> could just remove the favicon html altogether
13:48:44 <strcat[m]> and go by Accept header
13:48:44 <strcat[m]> :(
13:51:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> did you already apply the "horrible hack"?
13:52:16 <strcat[m]> yes for staging
13:52:19 <strcat[m]> try it fresh
13:52:42 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/1f11d4fe42147dcddf45a230642dd1780d773494
13:54:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> staging, in Tabs and Bookmarks sidemenu - blacklogo with white background
13:54:27 <strcat[m]> doesn't work for firefox cause it doesn't set image/svg+xml in accept
13:54:42 <strcat[m]> image/webp,/
13:54:45 <strcat[m]> it puts that
13:55:03 <strcat[m]>  * `Accept: image/webp,*/*`
13:55:09 <strcat[m]> sad
13:55:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> staging, URL and Bookmarks topdown list - black logo with transparent background
13:56:12 <DemiMarie> <strcat[m] "just not implemented yet"> Any ETA for this?  Not asking for any sort of commitment, to be clear!  Just your best guess.
13:56:24 <strcat[m]> no ETA
13:57:31 <strcat[m]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation/List_of_default_Accept_values#values_for_an_image
13:57:36 <strcat[m]> so it does work now in Safari?
13:57:56 <strcat[m]> can you open up web developer tools in it, go to network panel and click on the favicon.ico request it makes?
13:58:01 <strcat[m]> and see what it sets for `Accept` header
13:58:09 <strcat[m]> it's too bad Firefox doesn't explicitly say it accepts svg
13:58:21 <strcat[m]> maybe Safari explicitly says it only takes ico and png
13:58:25 <strcat[m]> browsers are SO ANNOYING
13:58:38 <strcat[m]> how are you supposed to avoid user agent sniffing for this
13:59:24 <DemiMarie> <strcat[m] "no ETA"> Thanks!
13:59:37 <strcat[m]> ah
13:59:39 <strcat[m]> I see what I have to do
13:59:40 <strcat[m]> rofl
13:59:49 <strcat[m]> I need to put the 2 entries in the html so that firefox uses the svg from there
14:00:04 <strcat[m]> and then rewrite favicon.ico to favicon.svg internally if image/svg+xml is sent in Accept header
14:00:24 <strcat[m]> and need to read how Vary works for Accept
14:01:01 <alex-resist> With gesture navigation, I cannot go "one step back", for example when inside an app I open a photo, and it opens in the gallery. How is that supposed to work?
14:01:26 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: back gesture is drag from left or right side of screen
14:01:27 <strcat[m]> if you mean that
14:01:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> back is swipe from the edge
14:01:34 <strcat[m]> it works the same as the back button
14:01:59 <alex-resist> strcat ok that works, sorry for bothering you with extremely trivial things. I do not find that intuitive tbh
14:02:44 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/632ba96bf84cbac8f5157ab7df07c7274b01683c
14:02:45 <strcat[m]> take 2
14:03:08 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: I find it a bit weird that it's back for both left and right instead of not having a binding for right and allowing setting a 'forward' option if supported
14:03:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> strcat, in the network tab of safari, i see the mask-icon.svg
14:03:24 <strcat[m]> it's intuitive on the left side, at least
14:03:30 <strcat[m]> mask-icon.svg is the tab icon
14:03:43 <strcat[m]> you should see favicon too but it probably doesn't fetch it if it already has it
14:03:45 <strcat[m]> so you need to clear
14:03:56 <strcat[m]> it also may not show it in the network menu since it's not actually used for the page
14:04:01 <strcat[m]> it's used for nav bar / bookmarks
14:04:03 <strcat[m]> so may not show up
14:04:14 <strcat[m]> also favicon generally fetched in background separate from page rendering
14:04:33 <alex-resist> At least in Chromium/Vanadium it would make a lot of sense to go back and forward as you described it
14:06:21 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: yeah we'll see what happens with it
14:06:26 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: they copied iPhone back gesture I guess
14:06:30 <strcat[m]> they could have done better
14:06:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> after clearing everything and only opening the page, i see mask-icon.svg, faviocn.ico, and favicon.svg
14:07:11 <M7777777y[m]> So tor has been experiencing a heavy amount of malicious exit nodes, as we know, malicious exit nodes can try to downgrade HTTPS to HTTP and alter the content. This makes me worry about using orbot with certain apps
14:07:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> please move to off-topic
14:07:41 <M7777777y[m]> If some of these apps don't force HTTPS, they could be manipulated perhaps?
14:07:50 <M7777777y[m]> Oh yeah moving there
14:09:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> * after clearing everything and only opening the page, i see mask-icon.svg, favicon.ico, and favicon.svg
14:10:04 <M7777777y[m]> Well one part of this topic was on topic - Are there any OS-Level protections to this in Graphene OS? To kind of force HTTPS an app that's using orbot?
14:10:48 <M7777777y[m]> I would totally block unencrypted connections through tor if possible
14:11:55 <DemiMarie> <M7777777y[m] "I would totally block unencrypte"> That needs to be done at the level of individual apps.  GrapheneOS does not control the networking stacks the apps use.  That said, an HTTPS-only mode *for Vanadium* would be a reasonable feature request, IMO.
14:12:52 <M7777777y[m]> Maybe this should be brought up to orbot
14:13:12 <strcat[m]> 7y: it's something Orbot should implement if you want that
14:13:26 <strcat[m]> 7y: it requires inspecting traffic to do a good job
14:13:35 <strcat[m]> the OS already forbids plain text traffic by default for apps and they have to disable that
14:14:12 <strcat[m]> nscnt: okay updated https://staging.grapheneos.org/ again
14:15:24 <somenerd[m]> What’s the intended favicon?
14:15:48 <somenerd[m]> Dark logo for dark mode and light logo for light mode?
14:16:39 <TheExplorer[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> seems to work currently"> But I also meant, is it good in terms of privacy/security?
14:18:22 <M7777777y[m]> > the OS already forbids plain text traffic by default for apps and they have to disable that
14:18:22 <M7777777y[m]> So you are saying the app is HTTPS-Only by default, unless say, the app element or tutanota specifically says to allow HTTP?
14:18:58 <strcat[m]> yes plain text connections via standard high-level APIs in Java are disallowed unless they override the network security config to permit plain text
14:19:04 <strcat[m]> for apps targeting Android 9+
14:19:17 <M7777777y[m]> So it's probably unlikely that they would have done that
14:19:24 <strcat[m]> if they do it via low-level code then it doesn't work, it's not based on ports or packet inspection
14:19:33 <strcat[m]> it's an API feature of the Android Java/Kotlin networking APIs
14:19:48 <strcat[m]> 7y: you can check
14:19:53 <strcat[m]> easily
14:20:08 <M7777777y[m]> How? I'm new to android
14:20:14 <M7777777y[m]>  * How? I'm new to android and graphene
14:20:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> strcat, the same behavior of staging (after clearing everything and only opening the page, i see mask-icon.svg, favicon.ico, and favicon.svg)
14:20:52 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config
14:21:11 <strcat[m]> wait safari is fetching favicon.svg?
14:21:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, that's what i'm saying
14:21:45 <nscnt[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't see it
14:22:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nscnt[m]: try clearing all history
14:24:16 <nscnt[m]> I did before, but I can see it now too
14:24:55 <strcat[m]> I'm making another change
14:25:04 <strcat[m]> stripping out the type/sizes info for favicon.ico since it's not accurate now
14:25:04 <strcat[m]> try now
14:26:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> strcat, the same behavior of staging again (after clearing everything and only opening the page, i see mask-icon.svg, favicon.ico, and favicon.svg)
14:27:03 <strcat[m]> I don't understand why safari would fetch favicon.svg
14:27:09 <strcat[m]> what order does it fetch them?
14:27:16 <strcat[m]> does it fetch favicon.svg then favicon.ico?
14:27:33 <strcat[m]> that would actually make sense and just means it's incredibly stupid
14:27:46 <nscnt[m]> ico then svg for me
14:27:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mask-icon.svg then redirect.js then favicon.ico, and last favicon.svg
14:28:07 <strcat[m]> the spec says that browsers should choose the best choice based on `type` and `sizes`, implying they shouldn't fetch a `type` they don't support (and it doesn't support svg for this)
14:28:24 <strcat[m]> and it's supposed to break ties by using the last one it considers equal value
14:28:40 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense for Safari to fetch favicon.ico and then favicon.svg since it explicitly doesn't support that type :(
14:28:42 <strcat[m]> it's just trash
14:28:46 <strcat[m]>          <link rel="icon" sizes="any" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg"/>
14:29:02 <strcat[m]> anyway it seems fine now
14:29:07 <strcat[m]> it's just fetching all of them because it's dumb as hell
14:29:11 <strcat[m]> don't care about that
14:29:42 <strcat[m]> the svg is 676 bytes compressed
14:31:52 <M7777777y[m]> In developer options Wi-Fi-enhanced MAC randomization is disabled, I think it was off by default, this is suppose to be on if I want my mac to be always being randomized yes?
14:32:12 <M7777777y[m]> I thought it was suppose to be on by default but maybe I'm confused and this is a different setting
14:32:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Don't go to dev options
14:32:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Iirc, it should be in WiFi settings
14:33:11 <M7777777y[m]> I'm trying to find the network config xmls for the apps, unless I have to go to their actual source code for that
14:33:18 <M7777777y[m]> Yeah its enabled in my wifi settings but not in dev options
14:33:22 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to use that
14:33:29 <strcat[m]> developer options are unsupported
14:33:32 <strcat[m]> they're for app / OS developers
14:33:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> i bought a pixel 4a 5g. I'll be able to flash grapheneOS, right?
14:33:39 <strcat[m]> that option doesn't do what you think and shouldn't be used
14:33:47 <M7777777y[m]> Alright disabled it
14:33:49 <strcat[m]> if it's not a carrier locked one
14:33:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Try checking OEM unlocking
14:34:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If you can do OEM unlocking, you can install GrapheneOS
14:34:16 <M7777777y[m]>  * Alright disabled it developer mode
14:34:25 <M7777777y[m]>  * Alright disabled developer mode
14:38:44 <strcat[m]> nscnt: can you check what Safari sets in the Accept header for the /favicon.ico request
14:39:11 <strcat[m]> nscnt: you could also test with a non-HTML file like https://staging.grapheneos.org/humans.txt
14:39:30 <strcat[m]> should show request headers in network panel if you click on it
14:41:21 <nscnt[m]> <strcat[m] "nscnt: can you check what Safari"> */*
14:41:25 <nscnt[m]> Uh
14:41:37 <nscnt[m]> `*/*`
14:41:47 <strcat[m]> okay that's fine as long as it doesn't explicitly include image/svg+xml
14:42:17 <strcat[m]> Chromium is super friendly to the server and actually lists each image type it supports
14:42:46 <strcat[m]> `accept: image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,image/svg+xml,image/*,*/*;q=0.8`
14:43:38 <strcat[m]> unsure why browsers are so weird
14:44:28 <strcat[m]> it seems like their approach is to list modern image types explicitly to get those if supported and then just accept anything else too
14:44:34 <strcat[m]> which actually works well for this
14:44:41 <strcat[m]> and Firefox / Safari just don't try
14:51:36 <nscnt[m]> <nscnt[m] "*/*"> Element renders Markdown differently in the web app than in the Android app. Super annoying. It was just a slash for me in the app
14:52:24 <nscnt[m]> an  i t a l i c  slash
14:52:30 <nscnt[m]> :D
14:58:59 <strcat[m]> nscnt: shipped https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/cf9bc8d45f274941bf5c8b4183fa38b8fe436604
14:59:19 <nscnt[m]> <strcat[m] "nscnt: you could also test with "> text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
14:59:20 <strcat[m]> not going to bother with cache busting since browsers hard-wired /favicon.ico fetches for non-HTML anyway
14:59:25 <strcat[m]> might as well just wait
14:59:33 <strcat[m]> nscnt: but I mean what does it say for /favicon.ico for that
14:59:38 <strcat[m]> nscnt: because it does fetch favicon for it
14:59:49 <nscnt[m]> same `*/*`
14:59:52 <strcat[m]> ah
14:59:57 <strcat[m]> okay happy with my workaround for now
15:00:13 <strcat[m]> now Chromium gets SVG as favicon for every page (even non-HTML) which is really nice
15:00:32 <strcat[m]> Firefox gets SVG for HTML (not non-HTML), and Safari still has a working favicon despite not supporting SVG
15:00:55 <strcat[m]> and this won't break anything since HTML is unchanged and /favicon.ico still gives ico unless browser says "I'll accept an svg" explicitly when fetching it
15:01:03 <strcat[m]> anyways fuck web browsers
15:01:04 <strcat[m]> totally broken trash
15:01:11 <strcat[m]> worse than solving some low-level UAF bug
15:03:38 <strcat[m]> nscnt: anyway if you look at it in desktop / mobile Chromium browsers can see it has dark mode support now
15:03:46 <strcat[m]> grapheneos.org I mean
15:04:07 <strcat[m]> including for a non-HTML URL like https://grapheneos.org/humans.txt
15:05:47 <strcat[m]> Chromium's mobile tab group UI is super terrible but I'll just not worry about that
15:05:57 <strcat[m]> it's super sketchy how it handles svg dark mode there
15:13:56 <nscnt[m]> I wonder if the tab group replicates the internal structure (of the isolation/whatever), or did they just make it up (badly)?
15:14:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> just to confirm, the accept headers are indeed just */*
15:15:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, when opening grapheneos.org/humans.txt, humans.txt and favicon.ico are the only files downloaded by safari
15:18:34 <strcat[m]> yeah it's all good now
15:19:03 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/2544be100686acf4c1553372f02938def0103a05/nginx/nginx.conf#L217-L234
15:19:07 <strcat[m]> the full implementation now
15:19:35 <strcat[m]> had to add an internal location block to reduce cache time compared to a normal svg (since /favicon.ico has no cache busting available in general)
15:19:38 <strcat[m]> all good now
15:19:55 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/ now has the best approach to dark theme favicon on the internet :P
15:20:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeeeiii, ahead of everyone!
15:21:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> now, can we talk a bit about it?
15:23:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the whole point of this was to have light and dark theme icon that looks beautiful and produces a somewhat consistent output in different browsers, correct?
15:24:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also because SVG is a priory better than ico
15:27:43 <strcat[m]> yes I only really cared about using SVG favicon for dark mode support
15:27:57 <strcat[m]> because SVG supports CSS and you can change colors based on whether dark mode is active via CSS
15:28:32 <strcat[m]> GitHub deals with this via dynamically setting it via JavaScript and cookies
15:28:33 <strcat[m]> pretty horrible
15:29:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work properly on GitHub anwyay
15:29:08 <strcat[m]>  * it doesn't work properly on GitHub anyway
15:29:26 <strcat[m]> SVG is also a superior format
15:29:31 <strcat[m]> it's tiny and scalable
15:29:54 <strcat[m]> the original icon is a vector graphic and we simply generate raster graphics from it via scripts so it's always worse to use the raster ones
15:30:03 <strcat[m]> no interest in having hard-wired icons for specific sizes min maxing pixel use
15:30:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh i see, so when light mode is on, the logo is supposed to be black, and when the dark mode is on, the logo is supposed to be white, correct?
15:30:12 <strcat[m]> yes
15:30:19 <strcat[m]> because dark mode is white text, etc. on black
15:30:23 <strcat[m]> that's what it means
15:30:34 <strcat[m]> note that it's not actually white, it's grey
15:30:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> my only corcern is the background
15:30:50 <strcat[m]> background is just transparent
15:31:08 <strcat[m]> as long as it's light it's fine to use any light color with dark mode
15:31:14 <strcat[m]> if the browser puts it on light background it's a browser bug
15:31:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, i know, but because of that, the icon itself is sometimes almost invisible
15:31:28 <strcat[m]> Chromium and Firefox both have some bugs filed about stuff like this
15:31:33 <strcat[m]> this fixes the problem though
15:31:38 <strcat[m]> previously it was always black
15:31:54 <strcat[m]> now it's black for light background, light grey for dark background
15:31:58 <strcat[m]> if the browser supports svg favicons
15:32:05 <strcat[m]> it's still always black in safari because safari is trash
15:32:13 <strcat[m]> but same applies to a lot of other sites
15:32:31 <strcat[m]> Firefox and Chromium both have a few bugs filed about cases where their dark mode is flawed, etc.
15:32:34 <strcat[m]> stuff is getting improved
15:32:52 <strcat[m]> if the user sets a black background theme in their browser without setting dark mode... that's their fault, can't really be supported
15:33:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, that's exactly why i have a small suggestion
15:33:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> to use a non-transparent background on SVG and change its color based on mode as well as you change the logo color
15:34:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this way you are guaranteed that the icon is visible
15:35:18 <strcat[m]> don't want to do that
15:35:37 <strcat[m]> it looks a lot nicer without a background and it's the browser's responsibility to implement light vs. dark mode properly
15:35:45 <strcat[m]> look at GitHub, etc.
15:36:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> understandable
15:36:23 <strcat[m]> also plenty of other stuff like Twitter, if your browser tabs were blue you couldn't see that, etc.
15:36:27 <strcat[m]> almost nothing sets a background rather than shape + transparent
15:36:28 <strcat[m]> it'd look weird if we did
15:37:01 <strcat[m]> and btw for desktop Chromium you can launch it with `chromium --force-dark-mode --enable-features=WebUIDarkMode` to force dark mode since not every desktop OS has proper dark mode support like Android
15:37:13 <strcat[m]> and for some reason they don't seem to have a toggle to override it as they do in the mobile browser
15:37:14 <strcat[m]> shrug
15:37:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Google does have a white round background and the rest of the icon is transparent
15:38:13 <strcat[m]> that's true but I strongly prefer how this looks
15:38:30 <strcat[m]> we don't put a circle on the page
15:38:33 <strcat[m]> so I don't want to put one there
15:39:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah i also don't like the idea of having a circle
15:39:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that would look somewhat weird
15:45:38 <eoo9> hey can anyone  here?
15:46:56 <eoo9> Could someone let me know how to uninstall grapheneos and revert back to the original os? the instructions on the website say to just do the same steps again but delete the boot key but that doesn't make sense. Wouldn't you have to flash with a different image?
15:48:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> eoo9: hello
15:48:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, that's correct
15:48:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can learn more here https://developers.google.com/android/images
15:50:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is recommended to use Android Flash Tool to revert your phone back to stock
15:50:54 <eoo9> thnks for the link
15:50:56 <eoo9> hmm okay

18:21:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> what kind of app requires you to do that?
18:42:17 <crowncoffee> Hello!  I am trying to install graphene on my pixel for the first time, but when using the webusb based instructions , I get to the point of clicking the button to unlock bootloader, but it fails to find my device everytime.  I have enabled file transfer mode on the device, am using the back USB ports instead of the front hub as guided by the
18:42:18 <crowncoffee> instructions, both the device and my computer are up todate, and the device is successfully paired with my system, and have tried multiple browsers.  Out of ideas on what could be causing the problem
18:45:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> crowncoffee: hi
18:45:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> does your PC come with USB-C port?
18:46:50 <crowncoffee> it does not.  I have a C to A cable I am using.  It recognizes the device, is charging, and shows in my devices list in chrome under chrome://device-log/      as well as       chrome://usb-internals/
18:47:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> most USB C to A cables will not work
18:47:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do you have another Android phone with a USB-C port?
18:47:55 <crowncoffee> Sadly not
18:48:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> what cable are you using, which brand?
18:50:35 <mrx777[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> mrx777: why would you do"> I just want to reinatall Graphene as test
18:51:26 <crowncoffee> it is an ikit cable, usb 2.0
18:51:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mrx777[m]: in order to reinstall a GrapheneOS on your pixel phone, you must use a second device, like a PC or another Android
18:51:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> crowncoffee: this cable won't do
18:52:13 <mrx777[m]> <crowncoffee "it does not.  I have a C to A ca"> Adapters, usbc to usb working not in most case. Try different cable or port.
18:52:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should either find a phone/PC with USB-C port or buy an actually good cable
18:52:51 <mrx777[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> mrx777: in order to rein"> Yes I tried via adb, but it stops at 47% for some reasons
18:53:00 <crowncoffee> I can certainly grab a higher quality cable from the store if you believe that to be the issue.  I can run to a local target, best buy etc.  Do you have a recommendation on specs or brand that should be tried?
18:53:25 <crowncoffee> I am assuming my next step would be a major brand like samsung, and ensure that its a to c via usb 3.1?
18:53:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i think Anker is a good one iirc
18:53:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, usb 2 will not do
18:53:43 <mrx777[m]> <crowncoffee "I can certainly grab a higher qu"> You are not working with vmware?
18:54:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mrx777[m]: adb is not needed for reinstalling GrapheneOS
18:54:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or are you trying to get back to stock?
18:54:30 <crowncoffee> unfortunately, C to C is right out for me.  I would have to either use an adapter or get a straight a to c cable.    MRX777 - no vmware or vm of any kind
18:54:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> adapter won't do
18:55:15 <mrx777[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> mrx777: adb is not neede"> How can I delete the current one to be able to have dev tools access? Currently I dont have it
18:55:27 <crowncoffee> Ok, off to the store then, thank you all tremendously for the help.  Probably just going to buy every a to c 3.1 they have and return whichever ones dont work
18:55:40 <mrx777[m]> <crowncoffee "unfortunately, C to C is right o"> Adapters not accepted.
18:56:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> crowncoffee: does your PC come with a proper USB 3.1 implementation?
18:56:43 <crowncoffee> I believe so.  We have 2 3.1 ports on the front hub (havent tried them) and 4 on the back (ones I am using).  Not sure what you mean by proper implementation
18:56:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> crowncoffee: read this https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210510#c7945302
18:57:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mrx777[m]: what is your host pc?
18:57:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the one you are using for GrapheneOS re-installation
18:58:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also, why do you want to reinstall GrapheneOS, is it broken?
19:01:53 <crowncoffee> Thank you for the link.  I have copied those recommendations and we get an approved cable.  Regarding the ADB info in your link, can I just ignore that, or would it still pertain to me with the webusb install? (I have not installed any ADB, not even familiar with how I would use them tbh)
19:03:18 <crowncoffee> From what you have said, I genuinely think the cable is my issue, so my plan is to procure a better cable, then just start the web install instructions from scratch
19:04:24 <vdh7[m]> I just got a problem with f-droid (shows zero apps) and aurora store (timeout every time tries to request session). It was working fine before. Someone has any idea what went wrong?

19:18:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, you disabled the settings app?
19:18:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Lol
19:19:46 <mrx777[m]> 😅
19:21:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeah, you might be able to do that from the bootloader interface
19:21:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I'm not sure how to do that tho, so you might want to wait for someone more knowledgeable than I
19:22:13 <mrx777[m]> But usb debugging has been disabled too. Adb fastboot is possible
19:24:04 <tharg[m]1> <vdh7[m] "I just got a problem with f-droi"> I think something is wrong with the service as the repositories are not updating for me. It might be that your app has either lost or reset repos and cannot get a new one, hence no content...

20:00:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s​lowthink> Already checked
20:01:34 <GhostSplinterSix> GrapheneOS doesn't contain bloatware like the more mainstream OSes do, so your battery should be lasting a lot longer.

20:16:34 <Sendit> Is there any app or something that can make the phone wipe if a specifik password is entered?
20:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Sendit, I have something for you to read on that note: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/29#issuecomment-542890418
20:20:16 <rathantara[m]> any chance graphene os on nexus 5?
20:20:16 <TheJollyRoger> Take note of the following quote:
20:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> > I hope you're prepared for whatever consequences follow as a result. This feature doesn't currently have a design sketched out and there's currently not much reason to think that it would be at all stealthy. It's going to be noticed that the data is being wiped and that the device has been put into a fresh installation state. It will be publicly known that GrapheneOS has this feature, as with
20:20:26 <TheJollyRoger> any other feature, so what happened won't be a secret / unknown question. It would be extremely difficult to provide any kind of plausible deniability for wiping the device, and even deleting a profile would be noticed. Wiping the contents of a profile and logging in to it as a fresh profile is a possibility, but it's going to be noticed that it's a fresh, wiped profile. It's not going to be a
20:20:28 <TheJollyRoger> secret that it was wiped.
20:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: No. Without ongoing vendor support, an EOL device is permanently insecure.
20:21:02 <TheJollyRoger> To do so would be like building a concrete bunker on a rope bridge.
20:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> It would not matter how strong you made the concrete bunker given that its strength would be limited by the durability of the rickety planks and rope of the rope bridge it's being built on.
20:21:43 <rathantara[m]> lineageos still supports nexus 5
20:21:53 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: we're not LineageOS.
20:22:00 <rathantara[m]> i know
20:22:08 <rathantara[m]> i want graphene
20:22:54 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: If you'd like GrapheneOS, I suggest buying a Pixel 5. There is nothing stopping you from porting GrapheneOS to your Nexus 5, but even if the operating system is secure, the handset most definitely won't be, because the SoC is no longer recieving updates.
20:23:33 <rathantara[m]> i know but why support for expansive pixel phones?
20:24:04 <rathantara[m]> i want a cheap smartphone with privacy not investing in a pixel
20:24:05 <Sendit> ThejollyRoger i dont mind if it shows that the phone is being wiped i just want it so if i write that password the whole phone gets wiped
20:24:48 <entry1> <rathantara[m] "i want a cheap smartphone with p"> 3a (1 year of support) is $100
20:24:50 <akc3n[m]> <rathantara[m] "i know but why support for expan"> > Devices need to be meeting the standards of the project in order to be considered as potential targets. In addition to support for installing other operating systems, standard hardware-based security features like the hardware-backed keystores, verified boot, attestation and various hardware-based exploit mitigations need to be available. Devices also need to have
20:24:50 <akc3n[m]> decent integration of IOMMUs for isolating components such as the GPU, radios (NFC, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular), media decode / encode, image processor, etc., because if the hardware / firmware support is missing or broken, there's not much that the OS can do to provide an alternative. Devices with support for alternative operating systems as an afterthought will not be considered. Devices need to have proper ongoing
20:24:50 <akc3n[m]> support for their firmware and software specific to the hardware like drivers in order to provide proper full security updates too. Devices that are end-of-life and no longer receiving these updates will not be supported.
20:24:52 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: The reason why Pixel phones are supported is because they are the most secure, and they are the only handset that allows non-vendor operating systems to use all the handset's hardware security features, they are the only handsets whose vendors fully open source drivers, and make firmware source code available to people who ask for it, the only vendors that are diligent with
20:24:55 <TheJollyRoger> security updates and upstream those updates.
20:25:20 <TheJollyRoger> Other vendors simply do not do this, or they instead cripple the phones' hardware security features if you want to run an operating system that doesn't come from the vendor.
20:25:25 <akc3n[m]> <rathantara[m] "i want a cheap smartphone with p"> Please read the FAQ. It answers your questions.
20:25:41 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support This should explain it better.
20:25:43 <rathantara[m]> the most secure are only open sourced
20:26:05 <rathantara[m]> like pinephone. librem
20:26:09 <TheJollyRoger> Sendit: Yep, if you have code to submit, the PR's open
20:26:20 <rathantara[m]> the firmware!
20:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: the pinephone and librem5 are closed source, they're just marketed with misleading advertisements that greatly overstate what they are.
20:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: did you read the fine print? The Librem5 has tons of binary firmware, it's just fused into read-only memory and loaded outside of the control of the host, so it gives the *illusion* of having no firmware.
20:26:52 <akc3n[m]> <rathantara[m] "like pinephone. librem"> Please don't spread misinformation like that. Those phones are a gimmick.
20:27:13 <rathantara[m]> i mean open source components
20:27:18 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, this makes the phone permanently vulnerable because now its firmware which hasn't seen updates in god knows how long can't be updated, but anything for psychological reassurances.
20:27:32 <alex-resist> They are okay for hobbyists, but by no means secure. Regardless of the source model of their firmware
20:27:48 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: The Librem5 and Pinephone are closed source. There is nothing in them that is open source, except maybe the wiring diagrams, which are irrelevant.
20:27:57 <TheJollyRoger> ARM chip? Closed. NXP CPUs? Closed.
20:28:18 <rathantara[m]> ok
20:28:21 <rathantara[m]> did you tested invizible pro?
20:28:28 <TheJollyRoger> Not topical to GrapheneOS.
20:28:38 <akc3n[m]> <rathantara[m] "like pinephone. librem"> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html
20:28:48 <rathantara[m]> hey relax
20:28:58 <rathantara[m]> i asked a question
20:29:16 <akc3n[m]> And you are given an answer.
20:29:44 <alex-resist> rathantara there is an offtopic channel for discussion about other topics: #grapheneos-offtopic
20:29:50 <rathantara[m]> <rathantara[m] "did you tested invizible pro?"> ?
20:31:16 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: So, with respect to Librem5s and Pinephones, what you're essentially paying for is a Raspberry pi with its closed source firmware permanently burned into the platform, so they can claim that it's an ASIC, because the FSF considers permanently burned-in firmware to be an "ASIC".
20:31:24 <TheJollyRoger> And thus, out of scope.
20:31:33 <TheJollyRoger> But you're not getting what you think you are getting.
20:31:46 <rathantara[m]> ok relax man!
20:32:22 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: I'm perfectly relaxed, mate, there is no malice in any of this.
20:32:30 <alex-resist> We're chill :) this is just a touchy subject on this channel because there is so much false advertisement and misinformation out there
20:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
20:33:22 <rathantara[m]> some guy on a room complained about you critisizing calyxos
20:33:29 <rathantara[m]> just for info
20:33:57 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: The projects have differences in opinion, design, and philosophy.
20:34:09 <rathantara[m]> of course
20:34:51 <alex-resist> I'm all for constructive criticism. CalyxOS and GrapheneOS have different audiences. Yet certain people out there try to make it a battle between two titans or something.
20:35:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir! I'd rather focus on the tech, than stoke fires over differences in community or philosophy.
20:35:44 <GhostSplinterSix> <rathantara[m] "some guy on a room complained ab"> I doubt that.. Compared to a lot of the rooms on here, the members of this one and the Off-Topic room are among the most respectful.
20:36:12 <rathantara[m]> not you from this room
20:36:51 <GhostSplinterSix> I know that. I'm calling BS on what that person said.
20:37:56 <TheJollyRoger> People always will bash if given the chance to. But that doesn't mean I have to pay them any heed. GrapheneOS has a clear goal and design, and that's the end of that. In any case, if you have questions about GrapheneOS, go ahead and ask, but I'd prefer to keep the topic on GrapheneOS.
20:38:39 <rathantara[m]> other devices supported in future?
20:38:44 <TheJollyRoger> Be sure to read the FAQ, which should help answer a lot of questions about what the project does and what the goals are, and why GrapheneOS does things the way it does.
20:39:06 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: Quite possibly, yes. But they'd have to meet or exceed the security standards of the Pixels and allow for third party rekeying of the secure element.
20:39:18 <TheJollyRoger> They're also needs to be a maintainer for the device, so I'll give you a quick rundown on that:
20:39:22 <TheJollyRoger> *there also
20:39:32 <alex-resist> People who are really good at security things are often overworked and gloomy. Sometimes discussions get out of hand. But the longer I take part in both channels, the more I appreciate both #calyxos and #grapheneos people. It's just two different approaches to a similar topic.
20:40:17 <TheJollyRoger> On Android, a large amount of security is device-specific, which means that much like Coreboot, GrapheneOS has to be ported to each specific device that it runs on, and needs to be maintained accordingly, in order to not just meet, but actually *exceed* the security properties of a vendor operating system.
20:40:55 <rathantara[m]> ok. so the anonimization?
20:41:21 <TheJollyRoger> A good rule of thumb on this you can go by is to consider maintaining of one device family that shares the same SoC (for example, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3XL, they use the same chip, the only difference between them is the driver used for the XL's screen is different), is a full time job.
20:41:35 <rathantara[m]> where is the compromise between security and anonimization?
20:41:37 <TheJollyRoger> This means that one device family, requires one person spending 40 hours a week doing the work on it.
20:41:55 <snowmiser-04> Good afternoon all, I'm trying to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a. Read the FAQ, ran through setup instructions more than once. I've installed lineageOS many times (on other devices) so I sort of know the ropes. When I run flash-all.sh things seem to hang of the first fastboot. Installing from Arch linux. android-udev installed. Tried the ~/tmp trick. Also tried running the fastboot commands
20:41:58 <snowmiser-04> directly (to see if there was some error). Nothin. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious. Any suggestions?
20:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: Security is a prerequisite to privacy. So without security, there is no privacy. There's more to this, but my time is limited so I will just finish where I was:
20:42:32 <alex-resist> snowmiser-04 can you run "fastboot --version" and tell us the output?
20:42:50 <snowmiser-04> fastboot version 31.0.0p1-android-tools
20:42:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hi there snowmiser-04, can you confirm if fastboot will unlock and relock the bootloader at will?
20:42:52 <snowmiser-04> Installed as /usr/bin/fastboot
20:43:04 <TheJollyRoger> But hangs on ./flash all with no output to the screen?
20:43:09 <snowmiser-04> Stand by will confirm lock/unlock at will.
20:43:19 <alex-resist> 31.0.0p1 is not the latest but should be resonably recent
20:43:51 <snowmiser-04> fastboot flashing lock
20:43:54 <snowmiser-04> OKAY [  0.265s]
20:43:56 <snowmiser-04> Finished. Total time: 0.265s
20:43:56 <TheJollyRoger> rathantara[m]: So this means that for each device, one person needs to maintain it full time. Thus, new devices can be supported if they meet or exceed the openness of the Pixels and their security characteristics, and a maintainer is available to maintain the device.
20:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> snowmiser-04: Ok, can you confirm you are using the Google branded OEM cable?
20:44:17 <snowmiser-04> (looking at Pixel, it's asking me to confirm
20:44:22 <alex-resist> Can you check that you are using a quality cable and a USB port that is on the motherboard of your computer?
20:44:51 <snowmiser-04> Nope, not a Google branded cable. It's one I've used many times flashing other devices. I figured that could be an issue...
20:45:20 <akc3n[m]> Try a different port perhaps?
20:45:21 <snowmiser-04> The only Pixel cable I have is USB-C to USB-C. I'm using a USB3 to USB-C...
20:45:40 <alex-resist> USB3 to USB-C is not automatically rubbish but the results might vary
20:45:53 <alex-resist> You might have a suboptimal connection there
20:45:55 <snowmiser-04> Let me switch to my Macbook and USB-C to USB-C
20:45:58 <TheJollyRoger> This generally indicates one of three things: either your USB cable is missing a trace, or your USB socket is broken, or USB firmware on your host is not supporting full features of USB.
20:46:12 <snowmiser-04> ok this is helpful
20:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> snowmiser-04: If you have a macbook, use the webinstaller, it's safer, faster, and more convenient.
20:46:24 <snowmiser-04> ok, will do. thank you.
20:46:28 <TheJollyRoger> (It's also just as secure!)
20:46:34 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck snowmiser-04, and welcome aboard!
20:46:46 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off for a bit, thank you for the aid, alex-resist and akc3n[m]!
20:46:52 <snowmiser-04> much appreciated!
20:47:08 <alex-resist> Always, shipmate :)
20:48:14 <alex-resist> I'm learning the new gestures so I'm naturally sticking around. There is a learning curve
20:49:01 <alex-resist> For example: more typos, because the keyboard is now a couple millimeters more south
20:49:39 <skwisgaar[m]> alex-resist: I really believe it’s a bit insulting to grapheneos to equate the two projects as if they are equal. Graphene has done tremendous work to improve device security https://grapheneos.org/features. Calyx is basically stock android with a few minor security improvements, customization and pre-installed apps. I’m not saying there isn’t a place for that type of project (clearly there is) but equating the
20:49:39 <skwisgaar[m]> if they are equal in ambition and improvement to AOSP is disingenuous.
20:50:01 <alex-resist> I haven't claimed they're equal
20:50:05 <skwisgaar[m]> Fwiw I just want a healthy discussion, not toxicity. I dislike conflict as much as anyone else.
20:50:17 <alex-resist> I just said there is an audience for both projects
20:50:44 <skwisgaar[m]> That’s a fair statement. I agree.
20:55:45 <alex-resist> I've tried Calyx but switched to GrapheneOS about 1.5 years ago. The reasons for that are pretty much in line with the project's rationale and I fully agree with the approach. However, I also know people for whom it's vice versa, so I'm all for deescalation in those matters
20:56:01 <vdh7[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "alex-resist: I really believe it"> yeah I think if you take for example the firewall. In calyxos it's a rebranded app I believe whereas it looks like the thing has been baked into in the OS permissions directly on grapheneOS
20:57:45 <alex-resist> What matters most in my work are the improvements over LineageOS, which still seems to be everyone's favorite alternative OS. There's still a lot of work to do.
20:58:18 <alex-resist> (teaching/training work)
20:58:23 <vdh7[m]> btw I was wondering if grapheneOS airplane mode is real airplanemode equivalent to switched off phone? (I get there is no physical kill switches though)
20:58:49 <vdh7[m]> <alex-resist "(teaching/training work)"> but that's only because they support more devices?
20:58:54 <alex-resist> vdh7 since there is no physical power switch either they might be equivalent :)
20:58:57 <vdh7[m]> wrong quote
20:59:09 <vdh7[m]> it's the sentence above I wanted to quote
20:59:39 <alex-resist> vdh7 no, unfortunately people come to us and want "safe" or "secure" LineageOS phones.
21:00:18 <alex-resist> This is quite offtopic tbf but explaining someone the situation in 2021 is quite a challenge when most people are stuck with security recommendations from 2010 or even 2005
21:02:23 <vdh7[m]> <alex-resist "vdh7 since there is no physical "> yeah but assuming there is no malicious adversary with a complex plan. would you be waterproof to wifi bluetooth scanning and gps/cellular triangulation?
21:02:44 <alex-resist> Yes, except there is no GPS triangulation
21:03:16 <skwisgaar[m]> vdh7: airplane mode fully disables the cellular radio. You can still enable bluetooth, wifi, etc. but if you disable those the phone won’t be communicating.
21:03:17 <alex-resist> A phone using GPS is completely passive and only receiving signals from satellites
21:05:05 <vdh7[m]> <alex-resist "This is quite offtopic tbf but e"> well I might not know the full development since 2005 but I read a bit of https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html . I think I understood the threat is coming from everywhere today
21:06:33 <alex-resist> vdh7 anonymity is only one desirable property, it should not be mixed with privacy or security
21:06:33 <vdh7[m]> skwisgaar: alex-resist ok thx !
21:08:18 <alex-resist> vdh7 one recommendation for you would be to read many different sources, not just one or two. Then you will find out what is consensus, what is controversial, and what is just one subjective opinion. It's really important to compare guides and different approaches
21:08:31 <yodawins[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.05.16.04 haven't showed up as OTA update yet for me? Anyone else?
21:08:46 <alex-resist> yodawins are you on beta or stable?
21:08:55 <yodawins[m]> Stable
21:09:03 <alex-resist> Well, it's not on stable yet
21:09:20 <yodawins[m]> Okay, nice. Thanks!
21:09:36 <alex-resist> yodawins just wait for 1 or 2 days, or switch to beta and help testing :)
21:12:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> The group's getting my notifications filled... I think I'll exit, and get back here when I finally get the OS.
21:13:06 <jj1013[m]> Same on this side.
21:19:56 <rathantara[m]> what do you think about divestos?
21:21:00 <alex-resist> #grapheneos-offtopic
21:24:20 <rathantara[m]> ok
21:26:13 <snowmiser-04> "Fastboot mode" is the screen my Pixel should be on while running fastboot commands right?
21:26:35 <vdh7[m]> besides installing my vpn, and switching to a private dns (I configured adguard dns as suggested in the faq) is there anything else to do to increase  privacy?
21:31:26 <rathantara[m]> you can try also LibreDNS with ads block
21:31:49 <rathantara[m]> https://libredns.gr/
21:32:17 <rathantara[m]> set DoH and put https://doh.libredns.gr/ads
21:33:09 <surveillexxxx[m]> Pi-Hole
21:33:09 <surveillexxxx[m]> graphene OS
21:33:13 <surveillexxxx[m]> Qubes + Whonix
21:33:46 <GhostSplinterSix> Let's move this to the Off-Topic room.
21:33:48 <rathantara[m]> I have pi-hole with reverse DNS
21:39:49 <_johnson> how do I unlock my device bootloader to install Grapheneos?
21:42:37 <snowmiser-04> Success! Was able to execute flash-all.sh from macos. Perhaps the cable was the issue?
21:43:12 <snowmiser-04> @_johnson see Unlocking the Booloader in https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
21:43:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Welcome aboard!
21:43:19 <snowmiser-04> (I just did this)
21:43:21 <alex-resist> That happens more often than you might think
21:43:23 <akc3n> snowmiser-04, welcome!
21:43:33 <akc3n> *welcome abroad!
21:43:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Please don't suggest people to use cli
21:43:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> People tend to not read it properly
21:43:59 <surveillexxxx[m]> all these people saying welcome aboard should get a medal
21:44:06 <snowmiser-04> Well, I'm not surprised. I was using a trusty cable from which I have flashed lineage many a time, but different device, different OS...
21:44:09 <surveillexxxx[m]> they never, wont say it to a new person
21:44:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Some folks have irreversibly bricked their phones
21:44:26 <akc3n> surveillexxxx[m], what are you talking about
21:44:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Web-installer is almost guaranteed to not a break a phone
21:45:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> So we only suggest web to newcomers
21:45:18 <surveillexxxx[m]> lol no im not saying it in a bad way
21:45:40 <surveillexxxx[m]> im saying you guys welcome everyone so you should get a medal
21:45:41 <alex-resist> I'm using a Thinkpad X230 and a random USB3 to USB-C cable (no idea about the brand) and I never have issues, but apparently I was just lucky. Issues are common
21:45:57 <snowmiser-04> That's my exact setup, alex
21:46:09 <snowmiser-04> X230 w/ random USB3 to USB-C
21:46:15 <alex-resist> What OS?
21:46:20 <snowmiser-04> it's wierd because fastboot lock/unlock worked ok
21:46:21 <alex-resist> Oh wait, you said Arch
21:46:27 <snowmiser-04> Artix (Arch variant)
21:46:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Off-topic guys XD
21:46:31 <alex-resist> fastboot lock/unlock is a much easier operation it seems
21:46:54 <_johnson> snowmiser-04 (I'm a noob and am using Windows 10) I ran command "fastboot flashing unlock" and command center says "waiting for and device" my phone still says it's locked and isn't giving me any option to unlock. Can I close the command center and retry with "unlock bootloader?"
21:46:55 <alex-resist> I'm just using Debian stable and it works all the time
21:47:33 <snowmiser-04> _johnson, the man says not to recommend cli to new folks. I should have kept my mouth shut... have you tried the web installer?
21:48:23 <_johnson> snowmiser-04 No... can I restart safely? If so how?
21:49:13 <fom[m]> <_johnson "snowmiser-04 No... can I restart"> on what part are you on?
21:50:06 <_johnson> fom[m] I'm in fastboot mode... device state is "locked"
21:50:39 <fom[m]> <_johnson "fom I'm in fastboot mode... devi"> if you didn't flash anything, I think you're all right
21:50:43 <_johnson> I'm using Minimal adb fastboot
21:50:50 <_johnson> okay...
21:51:08 <_johnson> do I just tap start on the phone?
21:51:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
21:51:20 <fom[m]> yes
21:51:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and also, delete your adb
21:51:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> adb is NOT needed
21:51:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> moreover, it interferes with the installation
21:51:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so just delete, start fresh
21:51:54 <_johnson> okay....so just follow the web installer instructions on Grapheneos?
21:52:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> using the web-installer
21:52:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> exactly
21:52:08 <fom[m]>  I personally dont like the web installer since i dont really know whats really happening, but your call
21:52:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read it twice at least
21:52:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and only start doing things after you finish re-reading it
21:52:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> follow it word-by-word
21:53:07 <fom[m]> also, when you typed the command to unlock, did you enable that option "oem unlocking" on your device?
21:53:14 <fom[m]>  * also, when you typed the command to unlock, did you enable the option "oem unlocking" on your device?
21:53:41 <_johnson> I enabled oem unlocking before I connected it to my laptop.
21:53:41 <snowmiser-04> @alex I was able to mount the Pixel using aft-mtp-mount and copy the fdroid apk over from x230/random usb cable... go figure.
21:53:54 <snowmiser-04> welp, i'm in business. Thanks again, lads!
21:54:17 <_johnson> Grapheneos says under connecting the phone: "On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot now: In Windows Update, click Check for updates. After that there might be a link "View optional updates." Download and install any driver updates. If there are no optional updates, simply continue with the installation instructions."
21:54:37 <_johnson> do I need a fastboot driver?
21:55:07 <fom[m]> for the cli? maybe
21:55:29 <fom[m]> are you sure you was on fastboot mode?
21:55:56 <_johnson> Do I just use Command Prompt for my cli?
21:56:09 <fom[m]> yes
21:56:18 <nscnt[m]> No
21:56:31 <nscnt[m]> PowerShell
21:56:36 <_johnson> I enabled USB Debugging orginally.... should I disable that?
21:56:51 <fom[m]> there isn't much diff in this situation you know
21:57:07 <fom[m]> <_johnson "I enabled USB Debugging orginall"> if you use the web installer or the cli you should keep it
21:57:19 <_johnson> Okay
21:57:44 <nscnt[m]> USB debugging isn't needed
21:58:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> fom[m]: please stop
21:58:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> because of people like, folks get their phones bricked
21:59:09 <_johnson> So how do I connect my phone to the cli?
21:59:31 <fom[m]> usb debugging isn't needed? you need to connect the phone to the computer
21:59:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> _johnson: again, just use the web-installer
21:59:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> usb debugging is not needed
21:59:55 <fom[m]> if you say so
22:00:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you better turn usb debugging off
22:00:52 <_johnson> okay...
22:02:10 <fom[m]> didn't mean to confuse you, it just made sense
22:02:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> fom[m]: i know you want to help, and it is appreciated
22:02:37 <_johnson> Sorry for the ignorant questions, but I'm confused as to how my computer flashes to my phone...
22:03:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> but fom, if you are not 100% sure about something, you better don't claim it here
22:03:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or say it, but say something like "afaik" or "iirc"
22:03:27 <fom[m]> Gotcha👍️
22:04:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> _johnson let me know when you finish re-reading the article
22:04:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and ask specific questions
22:04:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> broad questions are usually a time waster
22:06:07 <_johnson> Okay.... where do I enter the command "unlock bootloader?"
22:06:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> seems like you're still reading the cli
22:06:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> this is the article https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:07:15 <fom[m]> `fastboot flashing unlock`? iirc if you downloaded the adb folder
22:07:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, you see, that's also for cli, that's not web
22:08:52 <_johnson> so when I press the volume keys, it toggle between "restart bootloader, start, power off, barCode, rescue mode, and recovery mode."
22:09:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
22:09:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that means that you're in the bootloader interface
22:10:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> again, just read this article at least twice https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:10:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and ask your questions if any
22:10:32 <_johnson> when I clicked "unlock bootloader" it says "no compatible devices found."
22:10:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and only then you shall attempt to do it
22:10:51 <fom[m]> damn IRC doesn't delete messages
22:11:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> johnson, you're clearly missing steps
22:11:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> fom: yeah, moreover the room is logged, so even if you delete your messages, they will remain in the logs
22:11:50 <_johnson> okay.... I'll go back and try to understand what I'm missing.
22:18:35 <_johnson> I booted my phone into bootloader interface, connected the phone, and clicked unlock bootloader. it still says "no compatible devices found." what am I doing wrong, do I need to "install a driver for fastboot?"
22:19:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> there should be a dialog in your browser
22:19:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and you should click on connect
22:19:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> are you using Edge?
22:20:15 <_johnson> I am using Edge. Where would I locate the dialog?
22:20:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in Edge
22:21:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it should pop-up by itself
22:21:12 <_johnson> the one that pops up when I click Unlock Bootloader?
22:21:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> check for the drivers
22:21:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
22:22:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot now: In Windows Update, click Check for updates. After that there might be a link "View optional updates." Download and install any driver updates. If there are no optional updates, simply continue with the installation instructions.
22:22:26 <cron732741[m]> how can i fix that i don't have back button on bottom of my screen?
22:22:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> cron, back is now mapped as a gesture
22:23:06 <_johnson> i searched "fastboot" in my start menu and an app popped up... is that what I want?
22:23:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> just swipe from the edge of the screen
22:23:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no johnson
22:23:55 <cron732741[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> just swipe from the edge"> ok but how to have button not gesture?
22:24:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can go to settings and change your navigation setting
22:24:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is however recommended to learn the gesture navigation system
22:25:05 <cron732741[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> it is however recommende"> ok thank you
22:25:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is superior, it is the default, and it might at some point become the only one
22:26:53 <_johnson> do I need android-sdk-platform-tools-common as mentioned under the "flashing as non-root"
22:27:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no, that's only for Linux users
22:27:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Windows only needs the driver
22:27:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot now: In Windows Update, click Check for updates. After that there might be a link "View optional updates." Download and install any driver updates. If there are no optional updates, simply continue with the installation instructions.
22:28:06 <_johnson> I checked in Windows Update for any updates and there are none.
22:28:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> johnson, does your PC come with usb-C port?
22:28:51 <_johnson> yes. that's what I'm plugged into now.
22:29:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> are you using Google's cable that came with your phone?
22:30:00 <_johnson> yes. the usb-c to usb-c cable.
22:30:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok good
22:31:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> btw, do you have another Android phone with USB-C port?
22:31:26 <_johnson> yes.
22:31:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh, the installation from another phone is much easier
22:32:03 <_johnson> okay???
22:32:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in this case, just forget about your windows pc
22:32:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> use the other android phone with a chrome browser
22:32:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> make sure that both phones have at least 80% of battery
22:33:49 <_johnson> they do.... I'll see if it works...
22:36:59 <_johnson> the top 1/3 of my old phone's screen is unresponsive, but hopefully I can do what needs to be done....
22:37:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> oh lol
22:37:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which phone is that btw?
22:37:29 <_johnson> do i just connect the two phones and click unlock bootloader?
22:38:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes
22:40:00 <_johnson> it's giving me the same message. "no compatible devices found."
22:40:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is your pixel in bootloader interface?
22:41:06 <_johnson> yes.
22:41:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which pixel are you trying to flash on?
22:41:48 <_johnson> pixel 3
22:42:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and which is the other phone?
22:43:23 <_johnson> a cheap Apobob running android 9.0
22:43:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Apobob?
22:44:14 <_johnson> I do have a second pixel 3 i was going to also install Grapheneos on... can I use that?
22:44:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, you better use that
22:44:41 <_johnson> Okay, I'll have to charge it up.
22:44:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> basically you better use whatever has the perfect USB-C implementation
22:45:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> most manufacturers don't bother to do more than just charging and file transfers
22:45:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> while doing stuff with fastboot, requires a lot of low-level stuff, and makes use of all wires
22:46:10 <_johnson> Okay. makes sense.
22:46:33 <_johnson> Should I wait for the phone to charge to 80%?
22:46:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Google Pixel phones, Macbooks, Microsoft Surface Laptops are among those that implement it properly
22:46:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, charge it to 80%
22:47:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> recent Samsung phones have a decent usb-c ports
22:47:47 <_johnson> okay. that'll take about 1 hr and then I'll try doing the whole process and reach out if I have any issues.
22:47:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sure thing!
22:48:09 <_johnson> Thanks for your help! And sorry for all the ignorant dumb questions!
22:48:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that's all fine, we all have been there)
23:27:33 <Ryan[m]5> Hi grapheneos isn't recognising a USB I have used before. I am using an otg adapter. It still works on another phone.
23:28:07 <Ryan[m]5> <Ryan[m]5 "Hi grapheneos isn't recognising "> I tried rebooting
23:28:52 <akc3n[m]> Hmmm.
23:29:33 <akc3n[m]> Ryan: "This generally indicates one of three things: either your USB cable is missing a trace, or your USB socket is broken, or USB firmware on your host is not supporting full features of USB."
23:29:33 <akc3n[m]> Have you tried a different USB port on your computer yet?
23:30:36 <akc3n[m]> Ryan: also, when you say it still works on another phone. Do you mean like right now it works with another phone of you switch the phones? Or in the past it worked with another phone?
23:30:47 <Ryan[m]5> <akc3n[m] "Ryan: also, when you say it stil"> Right now
23:31:02 <Ryan[m]5> I just plugged in my charging and smoke came out
23:31:06 <Ryan[m]5> Uh oh
23:31:27 <akc3n[m]> 😳
23:32:22 <Ryan[m]5> Can I fix this?
23:34:19 <Ryan[m]5> When I it in now it charges for a second then stops
23:34:43 <Ryan[m]5> This is probably a hardware issue? Pixel 3a
23:35:14 <Ryan[m]5> Nvm charger seems to work
23:35:31 <akc3n[m]> I have no idea, especially when you mentioned you had smoke come out.
23:36:12 <Ryan[m]5> Rip :(
23:36:35 <Ryan[m]5> Plugged in says its charging but losing %
23:37:09 <vdh7[m]> <Ryan[m]5 "I just plugged in my charging an"> at least it didn't explode like the galaxy note
23:37:57 <Ryan[m]5> Yeah
23:39:56 <Ryan[m]5> It says charging
23:40:32 <Ryan[m]5> Gained a % now it stopped
23:40:50 <Ryan[m]5> Smells burnt
23:41:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Ryan[m]5: for your own safety please unplug the charger
23:41:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do NOT play with electricity
23:44:17 <GhostSplinterSix> Uh, yeah...unplug it.
23:44:51 <Ryan[m]5> I did
23:45:26 <Ryan[m]5> Is running aosp in the emulator secure while I wait for a new phone?
23:49:42 <M7777777y[m]> Is there a feature to only allow apps permission of network access when they are open
23:50:01 <M7777777y[m]> And not allow them to run in the background for anything
23:51:07 <M7777777y[m]> The options of "allow and deny" aren't enough in the case you don't want some app to try to run in the background and leak your ip
23:54:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that would make no sense
23:54:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it is a common question, check the logs
23:54:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> try looking here as well https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge
23:54:54 <dazinism> 7y: if you force stop an app it can't run in background till you  (or another app) restarts it
23:55:42 <M7777777y[m]> Like when you flick it up to close it?
23:56:04 <M7777777y[m]> Because I was worried about email apps trying to check for emails and give notifications for it when orbot is not active
23:58:28 <dazinism> 7y: no, long press the app icon on homescreen, recents or app tray
23:59:14 <dazinism> Then app info, then force stop
23:59:20 <M7777777y[m]> Ohh
23:59:30 <M7777777y[m]> I see
