00:43:02 <NewPerson> So, I'm thinking of buying a Pixel 4a at bestbuy so that I can install GrapheneOS to it right out of the box. I have a few questions before spending $400. I'm very new at this. Is there anything I need to look for to ensure that the precise Nexus 4a I buy will work, like maybe the serial or model number? I will be buying the unlocked 4a of course,
00:43:02 <NewPerson> but in Best Buy terminology "unlocked" only means the the carrier is unlocked. Is there anything I can do to ensure that the bootloader is actually unlockable before I buy it? Perhaps somebody here has already purchased an "unlocked" 4a from Bestbuy? Thank you.
00:43:32 <NewPerson> *Pixel 4a, not Nexus 4a
00:43:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hello NewPerson, yes, you will need to look at the model number. Let me try and pull up which one it is...
00:43:58 <louipc> i've heard you should avoid ones sold by sprint
00:44:38 <jameshandcockand> <NewPerson "but in Best Buy terminology "unl"> I bought one from Best Buy and the bootloader was unlocked
00:44:47 <jameshandcockand> If it is carrier unlocked, you can unlock the bootloader
00:44:53 <NewPerson> James, okay, thank you
00:44:59 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: hold it.
00:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> You will need to look at the model Number.
00:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> It will look like G025 and then a letter.
00:45:27 <NewPerson> louipc, thanks.
00:45:35 <jameshandcockand> If it's from best buy then you're good
00:45:36 <TheJollyRoger> G025J, G025N, or G025M are what you want.
00:46:27 <TheJollyRoger> The model number should be on the bottom of the box.
00:46:32 <NewPerson> Thank you TheJollyRoger.
00:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
00:46:47 <NewPerson> I don't need to concern myself with the serial number though right?
00:47:09 <TheJollyRoger> No, the serial number will not tell you much about the phone, but it's unique to your handset. So keep the serial number to yourself.
00:47:10 <JCD[m]> How do I know if it's Bootloader Unlocked?
00:47:23 <JCD[m]> Is Carrier and Bootloader unlocked the same thing?
00:47:31 <TheJollyRoger> JCD the way to tell is to look at the model number.
00:47:32 <jameshandcockand> No
00:47:51 <NewPerson> TheJollyRoger, where did you find those model numbers? I looked around the site, but I didn't find them.
00:48:16 <jameshandcockand> If you have to look at the model number, then you're doing it wrong. If it is carrier unlocked, then you will be able to unlock the bootloader
00:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> Under Google Support, phones sold with the correct band should be listed here: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570?hl=en
00:48:50 <jameshandcockand> Because the only reason it wouldn't be possible to unlock the boot loader in the first place is if it is carrier locked
00:49:17 <NewPerson> James, thank you. I just want to be sure before paying the cost for the phone.
00:49:44 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to look for the correct band for your phone, open the drop down, and look under "Network."
00:51:18 <JCD[m]> I haven't even turned on this phone yet.
00:51:58 <JCD[m]> If I'm switching to this phone, do I install Graphene before or after I put my carrier on it and make it my main phone?
00:52:15 <NewPerson> James, so what you're saying is that TheJollyRoger is giving me the model numbers of the unlocked versions of the Pixel 4a? Is that correct?
00:53:47 <JCD[m]> How do I check it?
00:53:49 <jameshandcockand> Sure you can use that but you can also just buy it unlocked from best buy
00:54:10 <jameshandcockand> That's what I did and it worked fine
00:54:32 <TheJollyRoger> JCD[m]: look at the model number. If it ends in a J, M, or N, you're good to go, if I recall correctly.
00:54:57 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: I believe so, if the model numbers end in those, you should be OK, unless I'm terribly mistaken.
00:55:08 <NewPerson> I certainly am not going to buy a locked version of the 4a. Then I'll likely have to have a plan on it for a year before they'll let me unlock the bootloader, if they do.
00:55:28 <JCD[m]> Ok, so it's a Pixel3A.
00:55:31 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: if you have any doubts, buy directly from the Google Store and select unlocked.
00:56:37 <niky> Hello everyone, is there any way i can transfer a few pics from my pixel4a (gos) to iphone via bluetooth?
00:57:00 <JCD[m]> Does Graphene have a list as to what serial numbers are fine?
00:57:18 <NewPerson> TheJollyRoger, So, as far as model numbers are concerned, those are only for telling me if the phone is unlocked from the store, correct, meaning that all I would need to find to verify them is to find the model numbers of the unlocked Pixel 4a's, correct?
00:58:12 <niky> ello everyone, is there any way i can transfer a few pics from my pixel4a (gos) to iphone via bluetooth?
00:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: I'm saying that *I believe* that if you are buying a Pixel 4a that has that model number, it should be bootloader unlockable and you should be able to install GrapheneOS to it.
00:59:03 <TheJollyRoger> niky: Dunno about how iPhones do it.
00:59:05 <NewPerson> TheJollyRoger, oh, okay, I get it. Those are just what you happen to remember when you read something on it.
01:00:44 <niky> Is there any app that i can use for wireless or bluetooth transfer for a few pics from my pixel4a with gos to an iphone ?
01:03:41 <NewPerson> James, did you have any issues where you had to do stuff off the instruction page to get Graphene properly installed on your Pixel 4a that you got from BestBuy?
01:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: get someone else's input on this though, since I'm not 100% certain at the moment.
01:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to the J.
01:06:11 <TheJollyRoger> I can't recall offhand the SKU numbers.
01:06:29 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: if you are running Linux and you use udev, you will need the udev rules.
01:07:52 <NewPerson> Okay. I was going to follow the instructions on, https://grapheneos.org/install
01:07:54 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: If you are installing from Windows or Mac, you won't need udev rules because they don't use udev. On Windows, you will need to make sure you use Powershell or it will give you an error.
01:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, that's the best way to do it.
01:08:59 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure to read everything before you begin, and /never/ use any third party fastboot or "minimal adb" or the phone will show you what an unbootable OS error looks like.
01:09:20 <NewPerson> I did this once with LineageOS and a Nexus 5X. Are the Pixel phones typically as straight forward?
01:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> Third party versions of fastboot often don't support autodetection so can end up flashing the wrong partition.
01:09:53 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: It's even easier, actually.
01:10:04 <NewPerson> I'll probably use linux so that I can use the repositories to install the adb drivers.
01:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: just make sure you do not use fastboot or ADB from your operating system's repository, unless you're running Arch and it has adb correctly versioned.
01:11:13 <TheJollyRoger> Always use the official precompiled adb from Google, otherwise a softbrick will usually result.
01:11:48 <JCD[m]> Can any model of the Pixel 3 to 4a be used for Graphene?
01:12:16 <TheJollyRoger> Installing GrapheneOS is even easier than installing LineageOS; GrapheneOS uses full production releases which allow the bootloader to be locked. Locking the bootloader is the final step of the installation.
01:12:47 <TheJollyRoger> JCD[m]: all supported devices (minus Verizon variants, which set a carrier ID and prevent unlocking) are listed on the FAQ page. Although images for the Pixel 2 are still held on GrapheneOS.org, they're there for archival purposes only, and should not be used.
01:14:07 <nux> NewPerson: You can purchase a carrier agnostic/bootloader unlocked Pixel 4a right from Google for $349. Bestbuy for $400 and not being completely sure about it's bootloader being unlocked seems like an unreasonably expensive risk.
01:14:21 <TheJollyRoger> I'm with that.
01:14:41 <TheJollyRoger> The safest place to get new handsets is directly from Google and selecting "Unlocked."
01:14:46 <NewPerson> Yeah, but I can drive to BestBuy tomorrow.
01:15:04 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: Google offer free shipping, if you can wait for ~3 days...?
01:15:11 <nux> NewPerson: Google shipped mine to me and it arrived in 2 days!
01:15:17 <TheJollyRoger> nux: ahaha nice!
01:15:41 <NewPerson> Maybe, we'll see. I generally like to get onto something immediately once I've put my mind to doing it.
01:16:13 <JCD[m]> Mine said it was Unlocked when I bought it off of eBay, but are you sure it should be fine?
01:16:16 <nux> NewPerson: Only you can weigh the risks for your situation. Good luck! :)
01:16:22 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson, JCD[m] actually, forget what I said about the model numbers.
01:16:39 <TheJollyRoger> I can't confirm so I'm gonna say just disregard what I said earlier.
01:16:43 <JCD[m]> How would I check if it's fine?
01:16:46 <TheJollyRoger> (WRT Model number)
01:17:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying to figure that out right now. I think the SKU numbers have something to do with it, but I would not trust the SKU number if you buy used;
01:17:53 <TheJollyRoger> Generally the issue with buying used is that a lot of the time the guys being paid $8 an hour to bail phones at retailers generally won't care what boxes or packages they stuff the phones into, and boxes and packages get mixed up.
01:18:07 <nux> JCD[m]: Unless you can get the seller to run through the steps to verify that the bootloader is unlocked, you'll never really know until after you have purchased/received it.
01:18:18 <TheJollyRoger> I'm with nux on this one.
01:18:29 <nux> JCD[m]: ...oh, and that's if you trust what they tell you!
01:18:56 <NewPerson> I've got to go. Thanks a lot for your help TheJollyRoger. BestBuy as a 14 day return policy . . . you know, if you don't brick it.
01:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. We've had cases in this channel of people who have bought phones from unscrupulous resellers.
01:19:28 <JCD[m]> I was able to unlock the Bootloader.
01:19:31 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: if you do brick it, Google has a web flasher that should restore your phone to the way it is, Pixels are hard to brick unless you fuck around with the bootloader image.
01:19:33 <JCD[m]> Is that an indicator?
01:19:40 <TheJollyRoger> JCD[m]: if you've unlocked the bootloader, you're good to go!
01:19:55 <JCD[m]> Okay.
01:20:07 <TheJollyRoger> Plug it in and start the process. Don't disturb your phone until fastboot says "Press Any Key To Exit"
01:20:18 <JCD[m]> I turned on the phone, and managed to unlock the bootloader in the settings.
01:20:33 <JCD[m]> Now, when should I install Graphene on it?
01:20:44 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I have a small checklist:
01:20:49 <JCD[m]> Before or after I go to my Carrier to make it my main phone?
01:20:54 <TheJollyRoger> A) First up, you NEED to get everything off that phone.
01:21:11 <TheJollyRoger> Any photos, pictures, videos, files... ESPECIALLY your 2FA one-time-passcode seeds...
01:21:37 <TheJollyRoger> JCD[m]:  it shouldn't make a difference, if your carrier allows you to bring your own device.
01:21:39 <JCD[m]> I just bought this phone, it's pretty much empty.
01:21:43 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
01:22:29 <TheJollyRoger> The other thing is the contact list - that better be backed up.
01:22:31 <nux> TheJollyRoger: I'd rather spend the extra $100(ish) for a brand new phone with a guaranteed fresh battery straight from Google, but that's just me. Sometimes you luck out with a used device, but quite often you end up in trouble.
01:22:58 <TheJollyRoger> nux: yeah, I agree 100%. Trying to pinch pennies on areas they shouldn't be pinched in never ends well!
01:23:36 <TheJollyRoger> JCD[m]:  you're pretty much good to go whenever. The phone won't care when you put your SIM card into it, GrapheneOS does not require you reboot the phone, just pop the tray out and put the card into it whenever you like.
01:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, I'm assuming your carrier allows you to Bring-Your-Own-Device. Some carriers don't and insist you have their devices which have highly privileged drivers installed, but I don't know which ones they are.
01:30:02 <nux> TheJollyRoger, JCD[m]: When I got my Pixel 4a, I popped my T-Mobile sim card in, booted it up to Google's OS, did all the updates to catch any firmware updates, etc. and then proceeded to reflash it with GrapheneOS. Went smooth as butter without a single hiccup! T-Mobile seems to be fine with BYOD. As a side note, I'm getting 2-3 days between charges with normal to heavy use!
01:30:39 <nux> I've even gotten 4 days between charges with light use!
01:30:51 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! That's awesome to hear nux!
01:32:52 <nux> TheJollyRoger: That alone shows how much underlying processing/transmitting of data that goes on in the background on carrier/phone manufacturer stock OS. Lots of spying/collecting of stats, uploading that data, etc.
01:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
01:33:17 <nux> TheJollyRoger: All of that takes battery life.
01:34:32 <nux> TheJollyRoger: Turns out that with all of google's framework stripped out, stock Android is pretty efficient! Who'd of thunk! :P
01:34:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hahahaha, yeah!
01:36:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's kind of funny, but if I recall right all of the improvements in batteries we've seen are something of an illusion; all of it's in software optimization and the phone being able to sleep or suspend processes and save on clock cycles when not needed.
01:36:25 <TheJollyRoger> *we've seen in most recent years
01:36:45 <TheJollyRoger> Although...
01:37:37 <nux> TheJollyRoger: Battery technology has come along as well but yeah, code/process optimization and duty-cycle management makes a huge difference.
01:37:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:38:08 <TheJollyRoger> I have some hopes for lithium iron-phosphate batteries, but I don't know if the technology with them scales the same way yet.
01:38:41 <JCD[m]> I'm stuck with AT&T, hopefully it works.
01:38:49 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck JCD[m]
01:40:44 <nux> TheJollyRoger: They call it, "Google Services" but those services are mostly serving the interests of Google! Sure, there are some user benefits but the drawbacks aren't even remotely worth it.
01:40:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah >_<.
01:42:43 <shardiame[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Any photos, pictures, videos, fi"> That sounds like the voice of experience ;)
01:42:53 <TheJollyRoger> shardiame[m]: Heh, you guessed it!
01:43:35 <Chris94> hey guys hope everyone is doing well and staying safe out there . but i have a few questions with this OS
01:43:52 <nux> TheJollyRoger: I always get a little miffed when I try to run an app that unnecessarily requires Google Services just because they were lazy/careless in their app development. There are many apps that run just fine without them.
01:43:58 <TheJollyRoger> I nuked my contact list a few times doing that (aaargh).
01:44:03 <TheJollyRoger> nux oh god yes!
01:44:09 <TheJollyRoger> Chris94: yeah, what can I help you with?
01:45:19 <Chris94> TheJollyRoger i recently installed this OS on my google pixel 4xl and i was trying to revert back to stock OS... im not ready to be off the raidar yet lol
01:45:27 <Chris94> radar
01:45:46 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. You need help getting back to the Google OS?
01:46:29 <Chris94> yes! exactly im having such issues i tried flashing another OS with no success its not rooted or anything..
01:47:51 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Alright, you've got two options: The first way is to either use Google's Web Flasher. That's the easiest way, and probably the fastest and most painless. The other way, is to do manual installation, the same way you installed GrapheneOS, and remove the GrapheneOS avb key from the bootloader.
01:48:22 <TheJollyRoger> The web flasher does require you use Chrome, if I recall right, since it uses WebUSB.
01:49:10 <TheJollyRoger> Er, what was the last line you got...?
01:49:23 <Chris94> i got disco i clicked something.. the one with a key i was seeing...
01:49:34 <Chris94> just reading,..
01:51:23 <Chris94> i lost all of our messages probably the key method would be best i tried using chrome to install os all the sudden the screen stopped working ...
01:51:43 <Chris94> like the touch driver i guess was missing
01:52:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You would probably best be served by using the web installer to revert to the factory operating system. Go to https://flash.android.com and that should walk you through it.
01:52:54 <TheJollyRoger> Touch driver was missing?
01:53:01 <TheJollyRoger> That's a first I've heard of it!
01:55:04 <Chris94> asop master phone ? i tried this earlier aswell and it reminded me of an old version of kitkat
01:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> Chris94: the other alternative is to use the factory images at https://develeopers.google.com/android/images and do the same steps you did to install GrapheneOS, using these official images.
01:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> There is one extra step - you will need to erase GrapheneOS' keys from the bootloader, that should be on the bottom of the "install" page on GrapheneOS.org
01:59:26 <Chris94> ok last but not least the images on the site mine is an unlocked pixel ..
01:59:50 <Chris94> i see : 11.0.0 (RQ1A.201205.008.A1, Dec 2020, AT&T) or 11.0.0 (RQ1A.210105.003, Jan 2021
02:01:14 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure you get the right one for your handset!
02:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> This one has them all for all of the phones and tablets that Google's released.
02:02:29 <Chris94> yes i have selected the 4xl but this one im guessing because its an unlocked phone ... 11.0.0 (RQ1A.210105.003, Jan 2021
02:03:58 <auto_warmbeer[m]> hey uhhh, under graphene my SMS (message) app only shows me new stuff when i open the app instead of notifying me
02:04:03 <auto_warmbeer[m]> although, sometimes it does notify me
02:04:26 <auto_warmbeer[m]> do i need t give it some kind of background permissions or something?
02:04:30 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i keep the phone in low battery mode most of the time
02:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> auto_warmbeer[m]: I think so, but I'm not sure. I've noticed that sometimes apps that aren't allowed to optimize for battery can end up fading into the background and then failing to "wake up" when needed.
02:06:41 <TheJollyRoger> Might have to fiddle with it a bit.
02:09:31 <auto_warmbeer[m]> under App permissions, I don't get any options
02:09:39 <auto_warmbeer[m]> It acts like the system already prioritizes it
02:09:43 <auto_warmbeer[m]> maybe I need to not use battery saver
02:10:00 <auto_warmbeer[m]> I'm used to Messaging working fine under various vendor android distributions
02:11:56 <Chris94> TheJollyRoger FAILED (remote: Partition should be flashed in fastbootd)
02:11:57 <Chris94> finished. total time: 9.507s
02:11:57 <Chris94> Press any key to exit...
02:12:09 <Chris94> thats normal with factory os ?

02:23:50 <Chris94> cmd ./ flash-all.bat
02:24:03 <Chris94> the stock OS im trying to flash
02:25:01 <TheJollyRoger> Quick sanity check, you're using the full image, not the OTA, and you have at least fastboot 29, and you're using Powershell?
02:26:42 <rny> TheJollyRoger: yea, some apps dont implement the jobscheduler api properly
02:26:49 <rny> and dont come back once doze puts them to sleep
02:26:55 <TheJollyRoger> rny: oh, sheesh, that explains it.
02:27:01 <rny> its like they are comatose :(
02:31:12 <TheJollyRoger> Be back in a bit.
02:33:54 <fll[m]> <Chris94 "cmd ./ flash-all.bat"> cmd? You need to use PowerShell.
02:40:09 <Chris94> TheJollyRoger holly shit guys wow after all day we are back on stock OS thank you all now time to flash another os ... lol any suggestions >??
02:44:49 <rny> Chris94: are you sure you're in the right channel?
02:46:36 <Chris94> indeed yes
02:46:56 <Chris94> i was trying to revert back to stock OS
03:26:13 <timeo[m]1> Question if I create new profile in android than I see that location is on by default
03:27:08 <timeo[m]1> Should it not be disabled by default?
03:29:00 <rny> timeo[m]1: what do you mean
03:29:07 <rny> do you run services that have location perm?
03:29:53 <timeo[m]1> No only system aoos
03:30:03 <timeo[m]1> * No only system apps
03:30:46 <tejdezoxo[m]> Just wanted to say thanks for keeping the project rolling. Sure most of the responses in here are asking questions.

03:35:35 <timeo[m]1> * It has location on by default, that's all
03:35:58 <stencil[m]> I see there's 2 profile, did the other one had location on?
03:37:03 <timeo[m]1> Is only one profile
03:37:17 <timeo[m]1> But try it for yourself

03:42:23 <rny> timeo[m]1: err ok, i dont remember if location capabilities are set to off by default for new profiles, but regardless, services/activities require user permission now to actually use the location capability **at least** on first-run
03:43:21 <rny> for background access, since android 10, users need to authorise **for the 2nd time** after location permission is granted to an application.
03:47:43 <timeo[m]1> <rny "for background access, since and"> Glad to know, but does it going to change or something like that
03:48:33 <timeo[m]1> For some extra security
03:48:50 <timeo[m]1> * For some extra security :)
05:02:12 <squarmkt[m]> For a second profile you can't send SMS & calls right? I remember a conversation about it, but would like confirmation.
05:50:41 <bentley> squarmkt[m]: each profile has a call/sms toggle
06:16:30 <OrganicPumpkin[m> <bentley "squarmkt: each profile has a cal"> This is correct. They work well in each profile if you enable it.
06:20:10 <TheLoneWanderer[> Hi
06:20:10 <TheLoneWanderer[> Just to confirm, does GrapheneOS use 512 bit keys for file encryption?
06:48:13 <squarmkt[m]> > <@organicpumpkin:matrix.org> This is correct. They work well in each profile if you enable it.
06:48:13 <squarmkt[m]> > I have a separate profile for all the apps that insist on sms, phone permissions when they don't need them and I just disable calls and SMS on that profile. Only way to get them to work and they can't read anything :)
06:48:13 <squarmkt[m]> Got it. For some reason I thought someone said secondaries can only receive SMS & calls and not send. Thanks!
06:52:25 <TheJollyRoger> TheLoneWanderer[: GrapheneOS uses AES-256 in XTS mode for data encryption. XTS mode uses two 256 bit keys.
06:52:34 <TheJollyRoger> So, yes, it does.
06:53:30 <TheJollyRoger> However, it should be noteworthy that if your cipher is good, you're not actually getting any security benefit from using symmetric keys beyond 256 bit strength.
07:06:21 <TheLoneWanderer[> <TheJollyRoger "So, yes, it does."> Thanks. I'm always a bit skeptical whenever XTS is mentioned
07:07:04 <TheJollyRoger> TheLoneWanderer[: The reason XTS uses two 256 bit keys is simply because someone wrote that in the standard, and therefore now everyone uses it now, that's all.
07:08:44 <TheJollyRoger> You're likely using a 3 or later, so the data itself is encrypted with AES-256-XTS, and the metadata is encrypted with AES-256-HEH (Hash Encrypt Hash). There's more about this on the FAQ, about how GrapheneOS uses the encryption and on the Weaver API.
07:10:15 <TheJollyRoger> On older handsets, I think the metadata uses a different mode of functioning.
07:10:55 <TheJollyRoger> You'll find more information here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
07:12:25 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, my mistake, it's CTS.
07:12:50 <TheLoneWanderer[> Thanks again. I read the Encryption FAQ and just wanted to confirm about XTS-256 because of its key splitting
07:14:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, got it!
07:59:14 <linxu> Hi there, new to G OS. Does G OS grant access to user root?
07:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hello linxu, app-accessible root will never be considered in any build of GrapheneOS; we consider it to be an antifeature.
08:00:40 <linxu> Ok, what non-app root access is allowed, adb?
08:01:12 <TheJollyRoger> Android is built such that only a few components, namely init, kernel, and vold have root-equivalent access, and the rest are intended to be confined via SELinux mandatory access controls to have the very least amount of privilege they need to do their job, and nothing else
08:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> Not in production builds.
08:03:48 <linxu> Blackberry android devices could prevent root access via hardware, do google pixel devices feature such hardware protection for root?
08:03:51 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall right, not even netd has root equivalent access.
08:05:48 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not quite sure what you're asking. If you're asking about the threat model of someone prying open your phone, then dumping and physically hot-swapping memory or lasering the chip open to extract hypervisor keys, no computer system will offer that.
08:06:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you're asking about Pixels denying debugging interfaces over the UART by default, then yes.
08:06:39 <TheJollyRoger> *denying debugging interfaces, such as over the UART by default, then yes.
08:09:49 <TheJollyRoger> In production builds, GrapheneOS shouldn't offer root to anything besides kernel, init, vold, and a few other low-level processes that have a legitimate need for it and that the user shouldn't be able to reach. However, I'm not a developer so take my words with a grain of salt.
08:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> (not yet.)
08:11:20 <linxu> What i meant, on android based blackberrys root access was denied by hardware, e.g. no exploit could ever get root, the device shuts down, thus these devices cant be rooted by any means
08:12:05 * TheJollyRoger starts wondering if Blackberries are turing incomplete.
08:12:25 <TheJollyRoger> linxu, have you ever heard of the Halting Problem?
08:13:31 <TheJollyRoger> In the 1930's, Alan Turing proved, mathematically, that there cannot exist a general purpose algorithm that can determine when any turing-complete computer system will halt or continue to run indefinitely.
08:13:54 <TheJollyRoger> So if you want a computer system that's free of exploits, it's going to have to not be turing complete.
08:13:58 <TheJollyRoger> Meaning, it won't be a computer.
08:14:19 <TheLoneWanderer[> Hi again
08:14:19 <TheLoneWanderer[> About to buy a Pixel 4A. Is it normal for it to have Android 11 by default?
08:14:51 <TheJollyRoger> So, I don't know what sort of sales pitches BlackBerry has made, but it certainly wouldn't be the last of it if companies make false or misleading claims about the security of their products. I really have no interest arguing about the hypothetical or unproven or another company's products though.
08:15:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hello TheLoneWanderer[, if I recall right 4As ship with Android 11.
08:16:13 <TheLoneWanderer[> Alright, thanks again mate. I just heard they shipped with Android 10 by default
08:16:25 <TheJollyRoger> TheLoneWanderer[: ah, huh.
08:16:33 <TheJollyRoger> I might be wrong then.
08:16:47 <linxu> Just a silly question, what is a normal price for a pixel 4a? I see numbers ranging 400 to 1000 for new device, found it strange...
08:17:30 <TheJollyRoger> linxu: The normal price for the 4a should be on the Google Store. Make sure you're looking at the 4a, and not the 4a5G - even though the 4a5G and 4a look very similar, they're entirely different phones underneath.
08:17:45 <TheJollyRoger> (Different chip, different kernel, different drivers, different everything.)
08:18:30 <hypokeimenon[m]> Different kernel?
08:18:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> Any drastic improvements?
08:19:55 <TheJollyRoger> hypokeimenon[m]: Yeah, if I recall right the 4a5G and 4a are very different phones and have little in common with each other underneath an otherwise very similar shell and form factor. I don't know if there are any improvements.
08:21:57 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to call it quits for the night, take care shipmates.

09:02:31 <rafff[m]> Hi, I did my first install of gos. I need the following apps: element, telegram, signal, newpipe, tor, Tapatalk, redreader, k9mail, keepassdc, google authenticator, tutanota.
09:02:31 <rafff[m]> I used to download them from fdroid and if not there from aurora store. Can I use both without installing microg?
09:02:31 <rafff[m]> Also, I used to have orbot always enabled, it is still needed with gos to hide my IP?
09:04:45 <anonhat[m]> Yes, you can use Fdroid and Aurora without microg. And Orbot is probably the best Tor app if Tor is the network/protocol you want to use to hide your IP address. GrapheneOS does not hide your IP address by default, although it does other things to try to enhance your anonymity on networks, like randomizing your MAC address.
09:05:27 <anonhat[m]> For VPN clients, either the OpenVPN or WireGuard clients will work.
09:07:13 <anonhat[m]> But anything Google will presumably require Google Play Services, for the record. So find another auth app instead of Google Authenticator.
09:15:57 <dar_gomml[m]> can confirm shadowsocks+cloak and v2ray as working too..
09:20:01 <TheLoneWanderer[> There's Aegis Authenticator
09:21:58 <TheLoneWanderer[> KeePassDX also supports TOTP and HOTP

11:15:11 <anonhat[m]> I'm not the best person to ask about IP anonymization because I don't really use it. But Orbot is the official Tor client for Android IIRC, so my instinct would be to recommend that for Tor. I2P may also work for "onion" style hidden services, though I haven't tested it.
11:17:12 <stencil[m]> Since tor is the most used I would say i2p sticks out more in net traffic as unique.

12:06:20 <usmadlhtev> I recently decided to get a pixel 3 and install grapheneos. i don't have any prior knowledge, so I apologize in advance for probably very basic problems/questions:
12:06:21 <usmadlhtev> i followed the installation guide on grapheneos.org, flashed my pixel 3 successfully (using macos high sierra 10.13.1) and grapheneos is running beautifully :)))
12:06:21 <usmadlhtev> BUT i don't seem to be able to lock it again, it won't show up under adb devices, though i changed back to developer mode and enabled usb debugging
12:06:22 <usmadlhtev> many thanks in advance for your help!
12:13:53 <nscnt[m]> usmadlhtev: You need to boot into the bootloader interface again. Connect it and then you can lock it.
12:15:14 <nscnt[m]> Just like https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader but with the lock command
12:17:43 <nscnt[m]> It will wipe all data, by the way.
12:20:00 <usmadlhtev> that's what i am trying, i successfully booted into the bootloader interface, but when i connect it, i can't "communicate" with it in the terminal, when i check for adb devices, it won't show
12:20:17 <usmadlhtev> thanks for your immediate answers!

16:21:13 <somenerd[m]> It isn’t a malware
16:21:26 <somenerd[m]> but it asks for dangerous permissions
16:21:35 <somenerd[m]> Which is problematic
16:21:56 <somenerd[m]> And the software may not be secure or have been audited (or the source code read)
16:22:05 <somenerd[m]> This is quite offtopic though
16:44:48 <atlas9[m]> What could be an easier way to get after what you want with vigilante would be to put your phone in developer mode, go to system > advanced > developer options > quick settings developer tiles and then turn on sensors. This will create a button in the top bar that allows you to manually turn off your phone's sensors (mic, camera, etc.)
16:45:27 <jameshandcockand> Or just know what apps have access to which permissions
16:45:39 <jameshandcockand> That's just what I do tho idk
16:46:09 <atlas9[m]> It's not as good as having hard kill switches like they do on the Pine Phone, but its as close as you can get in Android.

16:51:24 <atlas9[m]> Just making a suggestion for how he can control his sensors without downloading bad apps. I figure if you're putting an OS like grapheneOS on your phone you've already waded out into the deeper waters, since you could've easily bricked your phone during that process too lol.
16:51:35 <take_a_deep_brea> and i think grapheneOS has already made sensors permission access more granular by enabling a UI for it as described here :
16:51:35 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/features
16:51:35 <take_a_deep_brea> Sensors permission toggle: disallow access to all other sensors not covered by existing Android permissions (enabled by default for compatibility)
16:53:08 <take_a_deep_brea> atlas9: i appreciate the intention. just that its not really recommended to have dev mode on . and i think as to the sensors permission , graphene does move in the right direction as i stated above
16:54:18 <take_a_deep_brea> i also wonder that if the global sensors toggle was so stable and user friendly it wouldnt probably still be available only in dev mode .
16:55:20 <atlas9[m]> I think that Google would prefer users to not have the option at all
16:55:57 <atlas9[m]> Their intentions are usually bad 😃
16:56:17 <jameshandcockand> Seems like a stretch
16:56:25 <take_a_deep_brea> <atlas9[m] "Their intentions are usually bad"> i think we can discuss this further in the off-topic room
16:56:26 <jameshandcockand> They already let u unlock the bootloader
16:56:56 <take_a_deep_brea> i am very interested in defending google in some regards
16:57:07 <take_a_deep_brea> in some regards
16:58:35 <atlas9[m]> Alright I'll see myself out
16:58:58 <take_a_deep_brea> eh ?
16:59:17 <take_a_deep_brea> what did we say to upset him?
16:59:28 <jameshandcockand> He doesn't like Google
16:59:49 <take_a_deep_brea> that is very clear to me now
16:59:58 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe the bold letters did it
17:00:03 <jameshandcockand> I don't like google either but I like their phones and open source stuff
17:00:29 <take_a_deep_brea> they do a fairly good job open source wise .
17:00:33 <jameshandcockand> Other than that, hard pass on any of their services
17:01:14 <take_a_deep_brea> hopefully atlas9 does not go off and say some stuff about this room
17:01:54 <jameshandcockand> Ah he'll get over it
17:02:03 <jameshandcockand> I mean he already has a google phone
17:02:10 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah
17:02:59 <Thatcher[m]> Google is very ethical, open, and privacy-respecting
17:03:17 <jameshandcockand> Is that a joke or
17:03:35 <Thatcher[m]> Now to the off topic channel

18:27:15 <randomusertester> Do navigation apps need a-gps to work on Grapheneos? Or did graphene integrate something to know your location on navigation apps?
18:28:32 <strcat> navigation apps work fine
18:28:34 <strcat> GPS works fine
18:28:45 <strcat> are you having a problem that you need help with?
18:28:49 <strcat> please ask the question you really want to ask
18:31:39 <randomusertester> I ordered a pixel 4a to.install grapheneos.as my daiky driver and i was looking for all the alternative apps
18:56:38 <SirJarvis> Hi all
18:56:57 <SirJarvis> I need some help with installing Graphene Os
18:58:56 <SirJarvis> I tried to install Graphene Os on my Google Pixel 3 XL, and i came across few problemsduring installations and i fixed it all to the point where i supposed to click flash-all (Windows Batch File 2KB) and then cmd prompt opens super shortly and then just turns on but while it opens actually flashes i got this error from attached picture. I tried
18:58:57 <SirJarvis> almost everything from fixing path, copying new anroid folder to system files, installing powershell and trying from there but nothing helps so please take a look on attached picture and let me know if you have any solution for this problem, because i really want to install Graphene Os and stop using google etc...
19:00:41 <strcat> SirJarvis: you're not ever supposed to click flash-all
19:01:01 <strcat> SirJarvis: you've tried to follow broken and misguided unofficial installation guides
19:01:08 <SirJarvis> yes
19:01:14 <SirJarvis> thats probably true
19:01:21 <strcat> the first thing you need to do is closing all those
19:01:25 <strcat> not doing any more ofthat
19:01:29 <SirJarvis> i was watching it on youtube
19:01:32 <strcat> start by undoing everything those unofficial guides had you do
19:01:35 <strcat> yes, don't do that
19:01:40 <SirJarvis> ok
19:01:40 <strcat> remove anything they had you install or download
19:01:43 <strcat> get rid of it all
19:01:46 <SirJarvis> i got this error
19:01:51 <strcat> undo any changes they had you make to system settings
19:01:59 <strcat> SirJarvis: unofficial guides are almost all broken and dangerous
19:02:11 <strcat> undo everything they had you do as best as you can
19:02:12 <SirJarvis> the term fastboot is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet
19:02:13 <strcat> and follow https://grapheneos.org/install
19:02:22 <SirJarvis> with red letters
19:02:25 <strcat> > We strongly recommend following these official instructions. The official guide has a lot of collaborative effort put into covering all of the edge cases and is regularly tested by many people on each supported OS. Following these instructions to the letter without skipping, reordering or adding any steps will give you a proper GrapheneOS installation unless there's a hardware issue. We
19:02:27 <strcat> strongly recommend against following unofficial guides deviating in any way from the official instructions.
19:02:30 <strcat> > If you have trouble following this guide, ask for help on the official GrapheneOS chat channel. There are almost always people around willing to help with it. The official guide is the only supported installation method. Before asking for help, make an attempt to follow the guide on your own and then ask for help with anything you get stuck on.
19:02:42 <strcat> SirJarvis: if you follow the official guide, it works
19:03:01 <SirJarvis> ok i will try now again
19:03:11 <SirJarvis> but am not sure how this is going to work
19:09:03 <strcat> SirJarvis: the official guide works
19:09:10 <strcat> most unofficial guides are broken and have misguided workarounds
19:09:23 <SirJarvis> am actually trying now
19:09:28 <strcat> the people who made them mostly didn't understand the official instructions, they tried to make shortcuts which are wrong
19:09:32 <SirJarvis> and when i open powershell
19:09:40 <strcat> we have asked some to take down their broken videos, etc.
19:09:45 <strcat> they mostly won't
19:10:01 <SirJarvis> first thing that i have to write is curl or curl.exe
19:10:19 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal
19:10:31 <strcat> the first thing you have to enter is that Remove-Item command
19:10:35 <strcat> start at the top, work your way through it
19:11:05 <SirJarvis> i did it
19:11:15 <SirJarvis> and i got cannot find path
19:11:32 <SirJarvis> alias:curl because it does not exist
19:13:06 <strcat> you're not entering the command it says to enter
19:13:15 <strcat> if you don't do exactly what it says, it's not going to work
19:13:31 <strcat> SirJarvis: close powershell, start over
19:13:33 <strcat> don't know what you did
19:13:43 <strcat> start at https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal
19:13:46 <strcat> enter *exactly* what it says
19:13:58 <strcat> copy-paste the line if needed
19:14:05 <strcat> the first command is:
19:14:07 <strcat> Remove-Item Alias:Curl
19:14:15 <strcat> run it once
19:19:01 <SirJarvis> ok by now am actually ok
19:19:07 <SirJarvis> so now am on step
19:19:18 <SirJarvis> flashing factory images
19:19:59 <SirJarvis> what should i do with this part
19:20:06 <SirJarvis> tar xvf sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
19:20:07 <TheJollyRoger> Captain, would you like me to take this one?
19:20:40 <SirJarvis> should i copy that into powershell
19:20:50 <SirJarvis> ?
19:21:14 <TheJollyRoger> You've already retrieved the image via curl?
19:21:37 <SirJarvis> that part with curl is done
19:21:47 <TheJollyRoger> Do it.
19:21:50 <SirJarvis> so i have downloaded from officila page
19:22:00 <SirJarvis> os
19:22:14 <SirJarvis> and now i dont know with this part
19:22:16 <SirJarvis> what to do
19:22:21 <SirJarvis> tar xvf sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
19:22:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, enter that and hit return.
19:22:42 <SirJarvis> ok
19:22:44 <SirJarvis> wait
19:23:35 <strcat> SirJarvis: you need to follow the official instructions - don't come up with your own way of doing it
19:23:46 <SirJarvis> i follow all offical
19:23:49 <SirJarvis> this time
19:23:54 <SirJarvis> so now i have msg
19:24:04 <SirJarvis> failed to open sunfish facotry
19:24:09 <SirJarvis> factory
19:24:11 <SirJarvis> damn
19:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> SirJarvis: I will walk you through it, on a condition: you need to follow my instructions, do not take any extra steps or shortcuts, or any extra steps.
19:24:19 <SirJarvis> ok
19:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> Because remember,
19:24:30 <TheJollyRoger> I'm flying blind here.
19:24:37 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sitting over your shoulder.
19:24:45 <SirJarvis> ok
19:25:01 <TheJollyRoger> Computers /are/ deterministic, so the exact input will produce exact output.
19:25:49 <TheJollyRoger> So, let's find out where you are.
19:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to type in the terminal:
19:25:58 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
19:26:12 <TheJollyRoger> And tell me what you get.
19:27:30 <SirJarvis> ok
19:27:56 <TheJollyRoger> If you get an error, that's OK. I need to figure out where you currently are in this.
19:28:05 <SirJarvis> 0.0.1-4500957
19:28:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, good thing you told me. You've installed a third party fastboot package -- had you gone further you would have bricked your device.
19:28:43 <TheJollyRoger> (not permanently, but it would be rendered unusable until fixed)
19:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> You need to uninstall it first.
19:28:51 <SirJarvis> do you have any link
19:28:57 <TheJollyRoger> A link to what?
19:29:31 <SirJarvis> sry
19:29:42 <TheJollyRoger> You need to uninstall that version of fastboot before you do anything else.
19:29:49 <SirJarvis> how can i uninstall it
19:30:11 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know what you installed, so I can't help you there. That's going to be up to you. My guess is, if you installed a Windows package, it should have come with an installer.
19:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> If it didn't, you're going to have to try to figure out where it installed to.
19:30:57 <TheJollyRoger> Do NOT go any further unless you want to find out what the "No bootable OS" error screen looks like and be unable to use your phone.
19:31:11 <SirJarvis> o wait
19:31:39 <SirJarvis> so that fastboot was actually due to device visibility on cmd prompt
19:31:55 <SirJarvis> and i found that option how to install before
19:32:02 <TheJollyRoger> Since if your version of fastboot doesn't support autodetection and it flashes the wrong slot that's exactly what will happen and your phone will be unusable. I want you to get it so that fastboot returns a red text error that says something along the lines of this command is not found.
19:32:18 <SirJarvis> so i dont know from where should i download it
19:32:25 <TheJollyRoger> We'll get to that,
19:32:29 <TheJollyRoger> but follow my instructions in the meantime.
19:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> You cook before you eat.
19:32:51 <SirJarvis> haha
19:32:51 <SirJarvis> ok
19:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Don't get ahead of me, or I can't help you.
19:33:04 <SirJarvis> ok lets go from beggining
19:33:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Step zero is, we remove that old/third party version of fastboot.
19:33:22 <SirJarvis> i just returned phone back
19:33:29 <TheJollyRoger> Dude.
19:33:32 <SirJarvis> give me few secs
19:33:49 <TheJollyRoger> Please don't get ahead of me. Step zero is, we remove that old/third party version of fastboot to avoid it bricking your phone.
19:34:05 <TheJollyRoger> We /need/ to do this to make sure the computer doesn't select it during the process.
19:35:22 <SirJarvis> ok let me go to cmd prompt
19:35:59 <TheJollyRoger> This part's on you. You're going to have to figure out what you installed and remove it.
19:36:11 <TheJollyRoger> Because I don't know what you installed and I'm not sitting over your shoulder.
19:37:09 <SirJarvis> ok am doing it now give me a moment
19:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. I'm going to pour some tea.
19:38:23 <nscnt[m]> Weakling
19:39:11 <TheJollyRoger> ;)
19:39:30 <SirJarvis> btw
19:39:38 <SirJarvis> can this be done from cdm prompt
19:39:49 <strcat> SirJarvis: look, you followed broken unofficial guides
19:39:56 <strcat> and you continue deviating from the instructions
19:40:00 <strcat> SirJarvis: close what you've opened
19:40:17 <strcat> SirJarvis: uninstall any fastboot programs or drivers you've installed via windows remove programs menu
19:40:25 <TheJollyRoger> Shoot, I have to go for a bit. I will be back shortly.
19:40:25 <strcat> SirJarvis: remove any fastboot directories that you've installed
19:40:35 <strcat> SirJarvis: undo any changes you made to the overall system path
19:40:48 <strcat> SirJarvis: you follow very broken and misguided unofficial guides
19:41:17 <strcat> not a good idea
19:41:22 <strcat> you're experiencing the consequences of that
19:41:32 <SirJarvis> o damn yes i am
19:41:39 <strcat> also don't know why you're using command prompt
19:41:44 <strcat> it says to use PowerShell
19:41:47 <SirJarvis> i was watching on youtube 2 of them
19:41:52 <strcat> don't do that
19:41:53 <SirJarvis> "the hated one"
19:41:55 <strcat> it says not to do that
19:42:03 <SirJarvis> and other guy with 2 videos
19:42:08 <SirJarvis> jeez
19:42:35 <strcat> in the opening paragraphs at https://grapheneos.org/install#install it explains why you shouldn't do that
19:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> back for just a split second - yes, SirJarvis if you follow those guides now, you will likely end up with an unusable device.
19:43:09 <strcat> you risk bricking the phone and needing to reinstall your OS
19:43:15 <SirJarvis> i have platform tools in folder
19:43:19 <strcat> really not a good idea to be messing with system configuration based on what some youtube video says
19:43:21 <strcat> SirJarvis: remove it
19:43:34 <strcat> SirJarvis: remove ALL the stuff you've downloaded, for the official guide or an unofficial one
19:43:41 <strcat> SirJarvis: revert the changes you made to the system path configuration
19:43:48 <strcat> you'll have to figure out what you did and undo it
19:43:53 <strcat> if you can't, use another computer
19:43:59 <strcat> you broke this one
19:44:13 <SirJarvis> and when i open cmd prompt from there
19:44:18 <strcat> no
19:44:20 <strcat> stop
19:44:28 <strcat> SirJarvis: no more following unofficial guides / unofficial instructions
19:44:35 <SirJarvis> i get fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
19:44:43 <strcat> and you aren't supposed to do that
19:44:45 <strcat> remove the directory
19:44:48 <SirJarvis> ok
19:45:06 <strcat> remove the 'minimal fastboot' you install and any other fastboot drivers / zips / directories
19:45:23 <strcat> SirJarvis: you need to remove all of this mess before continuing
19:45:36 <strcat> SirJarvis: you said you edited the system path, go fix that, undo your change to it, that's really bad
19:45:53 <strcat> that's the kind of thing that results in needing to reinstall windows
19:46:38 <strcat> you followed some misguided video telling you to edit the system path and use some sketchy third party fastboot
19:46:40 <strcat> get rid of all that
19:46:42 <SirJarvis> yeap
19:46:47 <SirJarvis> am trying
19:46:52 <strcat> yeah, so your first focus is undoing all that
19:46:55 <strcat> and not doing any of that again
19:47:10 <strcat> you install a third party fastboot from a forum
19:47:15 <strcat> that some anonymous person posted there
19:47:26 <strcat> and it's their own thing with version 0.0.1
19:47:30 <strcat> not something that should be used
19:48:47 <SirJarvis> i think that i will have to reinstall windows again
19:48:57 <SirJarvis> this is all messed up npow
19:49:30 <strcat> undo the change you made to the system path
19:49:43 <SirJarvis> i think i did that
19:50:24 <strcat> SirJarvis: https://superuser.com/a/949577
19:50:36 <strcat> try using that menu to edit Path again and undo the change you made
19:50:44 <strcat> you really aren't supposed to edit the system Path
19:50:45 <SirJarvis> ok i will try now
19:51:11 <strcat> you could have finished this whole thing in 5 minutes by just copy pasting the commands from the official guide
19:51:18 <strcat> and it doesn't make any persistent system changes
19:51:19 <SirJarvis> damn
19:51:20 <SirJarvis> i know
19:51:22 <SirJarvis> now
19:57:16 <SirJarvis> Guys i want to thank you for your help
19:57:34 <SirJarvis> i will reinstall windows and follow official installation guide
19:57:44 <strcat> I don't think you have to reinstall windows
19:57:51 <SirJarvis> and join again here to ask for help if i get stuck
19:57:51 <strcat> just remove all stuff you downloaded
19:57:55 <strcat> and undo the Path change you made
19:58:02 <SirJarvis> i think i did that
19:58:44 <SirJarvis> do you want to try again now
19:59:19 <strcat> yes start over
19:59:22 <strcat> ONLY follow the official guide
19:59:26 <SirJarvis> ok
19:59:29 <strcat> don't follow things you've been told to do by unofficial guides
19:59:34 <strcat> don't invent your own way of doing it
19:59:38 <SirJarvis> of course
19:59:47 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal
20:00:04 <strcat> SirJarvis: so, no command prompt, no opening any terminals in certain directories, no downloading anything with a browser, nothing done in the file manager
20:00:34 <SirJarvis> ok
20:01:08 <TheJollyRoger> I return. SirJarvis, I can walk you through the steps if you're anxious about it.
20:01:23 <SirJarvis> ok that will be great
20:01:30 <SirJarvis> so now i will open powershell
20:01:34 <SirJarvis> non admin
20:01:46 <SirJarvis> i have powershell 7
20:01:57 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Let's take stock of where you are, we're going to do a quick sanity check:
20:02:01 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
20:02:24 <TheJollyRoger> If you've uninstalled all other fastboot versions successfully, you'll get a red text error saying it's not the name of a command or script.
20:02:56 <SirJarvis> yes  i got that
20:03:28 <SirJarvis> so now what should i type
20:03:32 <TheJollyRoger> Alright , and do you see a little "PS" next to the "C:\Users\Yourname>"?"
20:03:41 <SirJarvis> yes
20:04:19 <SirJarvis> i see that
20:04:47 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great. We're going to start by setting your curl alias because we'll be using this:
20:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> *using this twice
20:04:59 <TheJollyRoger> Enter the following command:
20:05:02 <SirJarvis> ok
20:05:05 <TheJollyRoger> Remove-Item Alias:Curl
20:05:26 <TheJollyRoger> And hit return. This command will return no output. Let me know when it's returned to the prompt.
20:05:38 <SirJarvis> i got now red letters saying
20:05:45 <SirJarvis> cannot find path
20:05:52 <SirJarvis> because it does not exist
20:05:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, your system path is still messed up.
20:06:07 <TheJollyRoger> You're going to need to set it back to what it used to be before the guide you followed messed it up.
20:06:31 <SirJarvis> yep that is going to be hard
20:06:42 <SirJarvis> i dont know if i can fix that
20:07:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. This I can't help you with because I don't know what guide you followed nor what it told you to do.
20:07:12 <SirJarvis> i think its the best for me to reinstall windows
20:07:23 <SirJarvis> i actually wanted to do that
20:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> But the TLDR is: whenever you type a command in PowerShell, your computer checks in a pre-set list of places that it looks for for programs, executables, and scripts. This list is called a path.
20:07:35 <SirJarvis> for a quite bit of time
20:08:20 <SirJarvis> anyway thank you so much for helping me
20:08:33 <SirJarvis> as i mentioned before
20:08:33 <TheJollyRoger> So if the path says "Computer, look in C:\windows\system32\ and C:\Users\myself\programs\ for commands" then if you type in say, "my-script" the computer will look for "my-script" in those locations.
20:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> Likely what happened was that something has messed up and removed crucial entries from that list.
20:08:55 <SirJarvis> i will reinstall it
20:09:02 <SirJarvis> and it will be okay then
20:09:20 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck!
20:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, we'll be here to help you out when you're set and ready.
20:09:44 <SirJarvis> thank you
20:10:03 <SirJarvis> have a nice evening
20:10:09 <TheJollyRoger> You too!
20:12:07 <Albakham[m]> Why do some people write unofficial guides instead of linking to the official website?!
20:13:04 <TheJollyRoger> "Not Invented Here" it seems.
20:15:46 <Albakham[m]> Does the GOS project plan on translation of the official docs? Because I could help on that
20:17:14 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure at the moment, but definitely stay posted, because it's something I could see happening at a far future date. It might require input from multiple people who speak the same language.
20:17:23 <LJ80> Hello who is able to help me?
20:17:23 <LJ80> I am stuck at this step:
20:17:24 <LJ80> fastboot device
20:17:24 <LJ80> < waiting for any device >
20:17:25 <LJ80> When I plug the cable in the dektop (windows) I hear the connection sound
20:17:25 <LJ80> But in de CMD you see it is still waiting for an device.
20:17:26 <LJ80> which step do I miss?
20:17:40 <strcat> you're supposed to use PowerShell
20:17:52 <TheJollyRoger> Hello LJ80, you need to use Powershell.
20:17:57 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal
20:18:02 <strcat> if you're not you need to start over
20:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> LJ80: you'll need to read everything in the installation page very carefully before you begin.
20:19:40 <LJ80> I have tried that also in powershell.
20:19:41 <LJ80> But there it is doing less.
20:19:41 <LJ80> Even not waiting for an device.
20:19:42 <LJ80> There I get this message:

20:19:55 <strcat> you aren't following the guide
20:20:00 <strcat> you need to start over at the top of the guide
20:20:03 <strcat> follow what it says to do
20:20:07 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal
20:20:10 <strcat> start here
20:20:14 <strcat> stick to the official guide
20:20:17 <TheJollyRoger> LJ80: Please read everything in the guide. You'll need to start at the top and work your way down without skipping steps.
20:20:22 <strcat> don't use other instructions, don't do it your own way
20:20:28 <strcat> do exactly what is there in the order it says
20:20:30 <strcat> nothing else
20:20:49 <LJ80> Okay thanks I start over again
20:22:44 <TheJollyRoger> LJ80 - make sure to read everything before you begin.
20:23:05 <LJ80> ok
20:26:09 <LJ80> Did everything...
20:26:17 <LJ80> now in Windows Powershell
20:26:28 <LJ80> now also stading here at this point:
20:26:29 <LJ80> PS C:\Users\steph> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
20:26:30 <LJ80> PS C:\Users\steph> fastboot --version
20:26:30 <LJ80> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
20:26:31 <LJ80> Installed as C:\Users\steph\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
20:26:31 <LJ80> PS C:\Users\steph> fastboot flashing unlock
20:26:32 <LJ80> < waiting for any device >
20:26:51 <strcat> what kind of USB cable are you using?
20:27:01 <TheJollyRoger> Is your phone plugged in and on the fastboot screen?
20:27:02 <LJ80> the one what is delivered with it
20:27:11 <LJ80> on both sides the small USB-C
20:27:13 <strcat> LJ80: go into windows update and check for optional updates
20:27:18 <strcat> for drivers
20:27:23 <LJ80> ok
20:27:38 <strcat> leave powershell open
20:27:44 <LJ80> ok i will
20:27:55 <LJ80> Should I try another normal usb port
20:28:08 <LJ80> and use another cable USBc-USB
20:28:21 <strcat> use the cable that comes with it
20:28:24 <strcat> look in windows update
20:28:29 <strcat> for optional updates
20:28:43 <LJ80> when i  run it is says i have all updates
20:28:59 <LJ80> wait i look where i can check for update drivers
20:29:43 <mynacol[m]> LJ80 There  should be a small text "Optional Updates"
20:29:51 <mynacol[m]> Under Windows Update
20:30:22 <LJ80> yes thanks found it
20:30:31 <LJ80> thanks
20:30:40 <LJ80> I have to restart my PC now
20:30:56 <LJ80> back in a minute witth the update if this worked, thanks
20:31:07 <mynacol[m]> Glad it worked and I was for once quicker than strcat  😃
20:35:45 <nscnt[m]> He didn't need to restart his PC for the driver update. He needs to set his path again now
20:39:47 <LJ80> back once again, PC rebooted after firmware update DELL
20:40:00 <LJ80> I am doing again everything in powershell now
20:40:08 <LJ80> back in a minute
20:44:18 <LJ80> still stuck on the same step
20:44:26 <LJ80> < waiting for any device >
20:44:49 <LJ80> only now I even dont hear the windows sound anymore when connecting the phone to the PC
20:45:06 <strcat> plug it in again
20:45:12 <strcat> try a different USB port
20:45:54 <LJ80> plugin in again allready did
20:46:06 <LJ80> but only have 1 small usb c port
20:46:24 <LJ80> I will check for another cable with normal usb on the other end
20:47:21 <strcat> possible that port doesn't work properly
20:49:58 <LJ80> id did something
20:50:16 <LJ80> saw a message on the phone it is unlocked
20:50:19 <zucchin1[m]> Just searched chat to see if anyone else has had this problem. After I complete the installation, using Win10, on a pixel 4, I get a "no command" screen. From this screen I can get to GrapheneOS recovery.
20:50:42 <LJ80> now phone is resarting and having the "Hi there" screen
20:52:05 <LJ80> strcat   but the powershell window still says "waiting for any device"
20:53:02 <LJ80> how do i put the curl command there now?
20:53:55 <LJ80> ctr-c   :-)
20:54:08 <strcat> do you actually have the phone in the bootloader menu?
20:54:12 <strcat> if not, that's the problem
20:55:09 <LJ80> how can i check this?
20:56:45 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
20:56:51 <strcat> > First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.
20:58:11 <LJ80> yes i am there
20:58:22 <LJ80> it says device state unlocked
21:01:28 <LJ80> strcat
21:01:29 <LJ80> do i need to download both?
21:01:30 <LJ80> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
21:01:30 <LJ80> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip.sig
21:02:01 <strcat[m]> you don't need the .sig because you're skipping signify on Windows
21:02:32 <LJ80> yes I use windows for this process.
21:02:38 <LJ80> okay i download only top one
21:03:26 <LJ80> Do I then give this command without the .sig in it?
21:03:26 <LJ80> signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip.sig && echo verified
21:04:09 <LJ80> or i can skip this step because the repositry is trusted right?
21:06:11 <LJ80> phone gives a fastbootd screem red letters
21:06:47 <LJ80> but powershell is still busy
21:09:01 <LJ80> now i locked the bootloader again :-)
21:10:00 <LJ80> and it loads with grapheneos :-)
21:13:55 <take_a_deep_brea> great!
21:17:44 <LJ80> yes it is, thanks for all support
21:17:58 <LJ80> strcat  :-)
21:19:41 <t0mo[m]> Are there any estimates on how many people use gos?
21:33:31 <TheJollyRoger> LJ80: don't forget to lock the bootloader afterwards!
21:33:37 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, you did,
21:33:39 <TheJollyRoger> great :D
21:33:44 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship!
21:34:24 <TheJollyRoger> t0mo[m]: I don't know, unfortunately, although at this moment there are 888 (ha!) users onboard.
21:34:26 <TheJollyRoger> Er,
21:34:31 <TheJollyRoger> users onboard the IRC/Matrix channel.
21:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that given the nature of the project, many more users don't sign on to chat here.
21:36:58 <LJ80> what is the best guide after this
21:37:09 <LJ80> for installing some kind of store
21:37:18 <LJ80> and recommand privacy safe apps
21:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> That unfortunately's out of our spec. You can install Aurora Store which can get you apps from Google Play anonymously and keep them up to date.
21:38:04 <TheJollyRoger> Aurora enumerates trackers in apps in their stores and tell you hich ones are GSF (google) dependent.
21:38:25 <TheJollyRoger> I no longer recommend F-Droid.
21:40:04 <LJ80> Yes read also a lot about this F-Droid.
21:40:04 <LJ80> But not safe anymore I guess then...
21:40:05 <LJ80> Okay look in too Aurora store and how to do this thank you.
21:40:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You can also get your apps from github as well, but you must update them manually.
21:40:39 <TheJollyRoger> Signal provides a self-updating version of their app on their website. It's hidden so you must search for it using duckduckgo.
21:40:49 <LJ80> thank you for all your tips
21:40:56 <LJ80> haha oh okay will do
21:41:24 <LJ80> hope this feels fine to use after 6 years iphone :-)
21:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
21:41:38 <LJ80> maybe switching the whole family ;-)
21:41:43 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome, awesome!
21:42:00 <TheJollyRoger> Please donate to GrapheneOS if you find it useful, and so the devs can keep working!
21:42:18 <LJ80> Yes for sure I do when I like this
21:42:23 <LJ80> but think i do allready
21:42:34 <TheJollyRoger> Great! \o/
21:42:58 <LJ80> do trust in this kinda opensource away from big tech XD
21:43:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe :)
21:53:52 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "Signal provides a self-updating "> While I am no duckduck, you might find here what you are looking for:
21:58:34 <cheeriope[m]> wouldn't recommend Molly
21:58:41 <cheeriope[m]> can't foresee it having support for very long
21:59:07 <cheeriope[m]>  * can't foresee it having development support for very long
22:01:17 <cheeriope[m]> also, Molly's readme suggests automatic face blurring requires firebase
22:01:37 <cheeriope[m]> i've seen other reports suggesting its done locally on device and never hits servers
22:01:38 <cheeriope[m]> which is it
22:07:44 <jameshandcockand> Well if you don't recommend it, I'll go ahead and delete it
22:11:18 <methodman[m]> GrapheneOS default keyboard vs openboard, any differences or advantages to either?
22:12:00 <LJ80> And why do you not recommend F-droid anymore?
22:18:31 <shardiame[m]> <LJ80 "And why do you not recommend F-d"> I had heard comments about app updates being very slow through F-droid.  I'm not sure what the recommended alternative is.  Aurora?
22:26:47 <blk> I just checked a couple of apps (Nextcloud, KeePassDX) and they were updated 3-5 days after upstream.
22:27:14 <blk> Google Play updateds the same apps on the same day as upstream. Which is all I'll say here since this should be in #grapheneos-offtopic
22:58:38 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "Requires a stalkerware tier supe"> Accessibility services.
23:12:58 <valldrac> cheeriope[m]: It uses firebase (ml) library not firebase service. I'll update the README to make it clear
23:18:22 <orion_> Hi. Is it possible to mount the qcow2 files of an AVD as read/write?
23:49:42 <ephemeralang[m]> Would the application sandboxing in graphene  os protect against something like this?     https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/hackers-used-4-0days-to-infect-windows-and-android-devices/
23:54:00 <bowbag> how cow, you guys get kudos for using IRC
23:54:18 <bowbag> I haven't been on an IRC server in 20 years
23:55:45 <bowbag> I have a quick question, I just flashed graphene on a 4a, all went well but when the phone boots up I get "your device has loaded a different operating system"
23:56:02 <M0x3vh8vy2l75lo4> Some features like AFwall would be great
23:56:02 <bowbag> is that expected? or did I mess something up?
23:56:18 <deappledapple> <ephemeralang[m] "Would the application sandboxing"> The android part seems to be an n-day exploits, and the CVEs involved are way past the Pixels existence
23:57:10 <bleachcrayon[m]> <bowbag "I have a quick question, I just "> That's normal. It means your phone is working as intended.
