00:00:30 <silicon_jim[m]> Many companies have tried and failed at this, including google apple and Microsoft
00:00:31 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I mean, doesn't Android already have that?
00:00:59 <silicon_jim[m]> Sort of - they have MDM.
00:01:12 <silicon_jim[m]> But its geared towards the corporate not the user
00:01:18 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "I mean, doesn't Android already "> Every user profile on Android has a Work profile (which is not what I am using as a *work* profile), which can be managed by your employer's app
00:01:47 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "But its geared towards the corpo"> Well, yeah, it's supposed to be managed by the employer
00:02:07 <silicon_jim[m]> So if I'm on a work profile on graphene - I still can't add my works gsuite email acct
00:02:12 <silicon_jim[m]> WO goog play services
00:02:34 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Ah, well, that's not the problem of the feature
00:03:12 <silicon_jim[m]> To me, the end user desiring a workable private mobile OS it is
00:03:55 <pnrxa[m]> Can't you add your GSuite email acc to a different mail client on the work profile?
00:03:55 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "To me, the end user desiring a w"> Maybe if the MicroG stuff gets added, you'll be able to set it up
00:04:12 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <pnrxa[m] "Can't you add your GSuite email "> The company blocks IMAP
00:05:37 <pnrxa[m]> Would activesync work or does that rely on IMAP?
00:05:42 <pnrxa[m]> GSuite supports activesync
00:05:56 <silicon_jim[m]> Will test that
00:06:02 <silicon_jim[m]> But doubt it
00:06:20 <silicon_jim[m]> Wasn't activesync a MS service?
00:07:10 <silicon_jim[m]> We don't have active directory or utilize them wherever possible so would doubt it
00:07:12 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <silicon_jim[m] "Wasn't activesync a MS service?"> It's probably a protocol rather than a service
00:07:50 <silicon_jim[m]> Taking me back to palm pilot era
00:08:08 <pnrxa[m]> You don't need active directory for activesync
00:08:23 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Btw, FairEmail has an option specifically for Gmail
00:08:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Can check that out
00:08:36 <pnrxa[m]> Just add it to an activesync compatible mail client
00:08:59 <pnrxa[m]> I use Nine but I don't know if it works without Play Services
00:11:36 <pnrxa[m]> Also regular Gmail doesn't use activesync
00:11:41 <pnrxa[m]> Just to make things confusing
00:18:26 <strcat[m]> going to try to get the Windows fastboot USB driver issue fixed
00:18:45 <strcat[m]> the issue is that a bunch of vendors have forks of the standard driver where they're just supposed to update the ids to their device's ones
00:18:56 <strcat[m]> but a bunch of them didn't remove the Pixel ids
00:19:01 <strcat[m]> and Microsoft apparently doesn't check
00:19:04 <strcat[m]> it's the same driver
00:19:20 <strcat[m]> Windows seems to just find an arbitrary one with matching ids and stops looking for more
00:19:27 <strcat[m]> instead of showing you all options
00:19:42 <strcat[m]> so I might need to get Google to upload the official driver to MS and also get MS to deal with the OEMs screwing it up
00:19:46 <strcat[m]> I think I can get that done
00:20:09 <strcat[m]> so yeah apparently
00:20:14 <strcat[m]> you can just upload some USB driver to MS
00:20:20 <strcat[m]> with another vendor's USB device ids
00:20:33 <strcat[m]> and then Windows will show people with that other vendor's device your driver, not theirs, arbitrarily
00:20:48 <strcat[m]> in this case I don't think it matters much since it's the same driver and is really simple
00:20:52 <strcat[m]> but still, that's fucked up
00:36:43 <strcat[m]> too bad it's Saturday
01:27:56 <nodevicedetected> Hey there people
01:28:07 <nodevicedetected> Anyone on?
01:28:39 <grapheneos_user_> No
01:29:08 <TheJollyRoger> *crickets*
01:29:21 <nodevicedetected> Excellent
01:30:08 <nodevicedetected> Anyone run into the issue, during installation, where the webinstall will not detect your device? (despite having usb debugging and oem on)
01:30:49 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicedetected: usually that's resultant of the USB on your computer being incomplete (broken, vendor firmware not properly implementing the standard), or a cheap cable.
01:30:57 <TheJollyRoger> As strange as this may sound, try switching ports.
01:31:08 <louipc> or cable problem?
01:31:19 <nodevicedetected> I've also tried to do it manually, using adb, and I can interface with the device, detect it, and force it to reboot into bootloader from the commandline
01:31:31 <nodevicedetected> idk if that answers the above concerns
01:31:40 <louipc> ok
01:32:19 <nodevicedetected> but fastboot flashing unlock just hands on < waiting for any device>
01:32:24 <nodevicedetected> hangs*
01:32:33 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicedetected: Yep, this sounds USB on your computer is broken or not properly implemented. Fastboot uses the full featureset available to USB 3.1, and some motherboard vendors are extremely careless and do not implement them all.
01:32:39 <TheJollyRoger> This can result in what you're seeing right here.
01:33:05 <TheJollyRoger> Try switching ports, try switching cables, or switch to another computer entirely.
01:33:21 <nodevicedetected> Okay cool, i'll give that a try
01:34:24 <nodevicedetected> Just in case its worth mentioning, the cable I was using was supposedly oem and its usb-c -> usb-c connection
01:34:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's unfortunate, but most vendors are really bad about this. The USB standard is actually very complex since it takes an "everything and the kitchen sink" approach, and contains far more features than most users ever will use. So most vendors simply say "oh, they'll never use this" and don't implement it properly.
01:35:06 <TheJollyRoger> It's worth mentioning that not even the cables that come with your Pixel 2/3/4 are actually up to the spec!
01:35:41 <TheJollyRoger> They'll install GrapheneOS fine assuming your motherboard properly implements the specification, but they can't be used for some things our developers do in this channel such as UART Debugging.
01:35:49 <nodevicedetected> oh well shit. The only other cables I have are a c to  c from samsung and some "3.1" a to c from some china amazon company
01:36:28 <TheJollyRoger> So chances are, if you see this type of behaviour from your computer where the "typical" functions of the computer work fine but then fastboot just hangs, it's likely that USB on your motherboard is not properly implemented by your vendor.
01:36:43 <louipc> the stock cable should be ok for installing
01:37:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, yeah, crud, be extremely careful using substandard cables - cheap cables can cost you your device, especially because the voltage is significantly higher, and what device charges which has to be negotiated by the devices and what they're plugged into.
01:37:38 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: which OS are you on?
01:37:56 <nodevicedetected> win10
01:38:17 <nodevicedetected> factory android on freshly factory'd phone
01:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> *voltage, sorry, I mean the current.
01:39:03 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone make sure to deal with the 2nd paragraph here
01:39:20 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: also no reason you need USB debugging enabled in the OS - adb isn't involved in the process (no harm in it, just not needed)
01:39:53 <nodevicedetected> I just installed adb minimal from the dev page
01:39:57 <nodevicedetected> so it should be up to date
01:41:32 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicedetected: The "minimal adb" package will result in a brick.
01:41:58 <nodevicedetected> Ah, okay
01:42:03 <TheJollyRoger> It needs to be 29.0 or later.
01:42:07 <matt80> I had the exact same problem the other night. Using the oem cable that came with the Pixel4a. Changing to a different USB port is what worked for me. Strange but it worked.
01:42:43 <TheJollyRoger> Third party versions of adb/fastboot don't support autodetection and often are versioned incorrectly, resulting in the checks failing.
01:42:54 <TheJollyRoger> Best case scenario: miraculously they select the correct slot and it works.
01:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> Worst case scenario: Brick.
01:43:17 <nodevicedetected> copy that, ill go back and look for the full version
01:43:21 <TheJollyRoger> Likely outcome: corrupted OS, unbootable device.
01:43:53 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicedetected: if you're planning to do the commandline installation, it's mentioned in the official installation instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli - you will need to remove all third-party fastboot/adb packages first.
01:46:02 <nodevicedetected> ill try the webinstall again now using the other cable
01:46:08 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
01:46:37 <TheJollyRoger> When you start the process of flashing, wait for the device to return you to the bootloader. While it's at a screen called "fastbootd" the phone is being written to.
01:47:12 <nodevicedetected> ah still no devices detected at the unlock option
01:47:14 <strcat[m]> the guide says that now btw
01:47:15 <strcat[m]> also https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/e9d409f992e34f991dae43e9ee582671b68719a4
01:47:20 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whew, great!
01:48:09 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: don't follow unofficial guides - adb is not used in the installation process, and 'minimal adb' is some sketchy third party software
01:48:35 <TheJollyRoger> which has a nasty habit of incomplete installs and bricking devices.
01:48:36 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: as I mentioned earlier, make sure to follow the 2nd paragraph in https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
01:50:29 <nodevicedetected> Just a moment
01:50:44 <matt80> BTW my installation is humming along nicely. Got a few more apps installed just downloading the apk's and installing that way. Talked with Xfinity today and they are sending me out a sim card.
01:51:18 <TheJollyRoger> matt80: Glad to hear it!
01:51:44 <nodevicedetected> I see a couple of optional updates but none of them seem to have anything to do with fastboot
01:51:54 <nodevicedetected> ill just go ahead and install everything just to eliminate doubt
01:52:38 <nodevicedetected> brb, restarting
01:54:15 <matt80> Any suggestions on a KeePassXC app?
02:02:09 <Chicomsstolemylu> KeepassDX
02:03:18 <Chicomsstolemylu> What ive been using for a long time. Has a clean good looking material interface the ui makes sense it has options to use autofill and the phones biometric authentication
02:10:13 <nodevicedetected> Hey fellas from earlier
02:10:41 <nodevicedetected> I appreciate the tips! apparently it was a samsung optional update that I was missing (using a samsung laptop)
02:12:09 <matt80> Good deal...it's working ok now? The USB port?
02:14:04 <nodevicedetected> Yeah ive successfully unlocked, i'm now downloading
02:14:56 <matt80> It takes awhile.  the phone looks suspiciously "not busy" but it will eventually reboot
02:17:18 <nodevicedetected> ah now its saying failed to fetch... lol (for the obtaining factory image part)
02:19:57 <matt80> I did the command line version so not much help.
02:20:27 <nodevicedetected> Yeah I think I may just go ahead and switch to that, i already downloaded the latest image earlier
02:21:22 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicedetected: it's working?
02:21:26 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo!
02:21:43 <nodevicedetected> Yeah man, thanks for the tips!
02:24:08 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
02:39:32 <TheJollyRoger> nodevicedetected: Any installation winds blowing yer way?
02:41:49 <nodevicedetected> still downloading the image
02:42:02 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
02:42:07 <nodevicedetected> couldnt figure out the windows shell shit so I went back to webinstall
02:43:07 <TheJollyRoger> Worse comes to worst, if it doesn't do it, at this time of the day I'm available to to talk you through the CLI method.
02:43:20 <nodevicedetected> ah well thats nice of ya m8
02:43:21 <TheJollyRoger> The web version should take the guess work out though.
02:43:33 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, it be what I be here for, shipmate!
02:44:48 <nodevicedetected> seems like the webinstall download mightve got stuck. it still says download but I dont see the drive reducing in available space
02:44:58 <nodevicedetected> downloading*
02:45:02 <strcat[m]> did you download it?
02:45:14 <strcat[m]> click download then wait for it to succeed
02:45:14 <strcat[m]> it will give a status update
02:45:31 <strcat[m]> won't necessarily use additional space, the browser might delete other cached stuff to make room
02:45:43 <nodevicedetected> Yeah thats what I mean, it still says "downloading" but its been about 15 mins
02:46:16 <nodevicedetected> ah well I didnt consider the browser making room for it
02:47:47 <nodevicedetected> ill give it another 30 mins and see where i'm at. Thanks for the response!
02:48:02 <TheJollyRoger> Of course.
02:48:07 <strcat[m]> it's an ~800M file or w/e
02:48:39 <nodevicedetected> Yeah i'm using work wifi, perhaps the connection is just slow today
02:48:46 <strcat[m]> kdrag0n is working on making progress bars for the download, unpacking images and flashing images
02:48:57 <nodevicedetected> that would be fantastic
02:49:09 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah.
02:49:11 <strcat[m]> or releases server has 2gbit bandwidth and generally is under low load because the update downloads are usually incrementals and finish really fast
02:49:13 <nodevicedetected> or atleast have the ellipses move around
02:49:21 <nodevicedetected> to show its not stuck
02:49:49 <strcat[m]> I get ~480mbit download from our releases server atm
02:50:03 <strcat[m]> usually 2x that when it's not under any load
02:50:12 <nodevicedetected> well thats not bad
02:50:32 <strcat[m]> I think my home internet is just slow atm from it being a peak time
02:50:39 <strcat[m]> server doesn't seem to be maxing out bandwidth atm
02:50:58 <strcat[m]> yeah it's not maxed out it has plenty of bandwidth
02:51:02 <strcat[m]> so it's maxing out your connection
02:51:05 <strcat[m]> just your connection must be slow
02:54:13 <nodevicedetected> yeah thats likely it
02:54:42 <nodevicedetected> forgot im not home haha, got 1gbs back there luckily
04:40:31 <nodevicedetected> Hey TheJollyRoger still here?
04:41:21 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: no but I can help
04:41:33 * TheJollyRoger zooms in.
04:41:37 <strcat[m]> oh nvm
04:41:50 * TheJollyRoger sloppily wipes the rum off his face.
04:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> *hic*
04:41:56 <nodevicedetected> Well either of ya fellas hah
04:42:03 <nodevicedetected> I went command line mode again
04:42:07 <nodevicedetected> got every downloaded finally
04:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> Preshent and a-*hic*-a-ccounted for, shipmatesh!
04:42:13 <nodevicedetected> got it extracted
04:42:21 <nodevicedetected> but ./flash-all.bat doesnt wanna work
04:42:34 <nodevicedetected> thanks x)
04:42:39 <TheJollyRoger> What do you get when you run it?
04:42:44 * TheJollyRoger sobers up hastily.
04:42:44 <strcat[m]> nodevicedetected: did you get the driver?
04:43:28 <nodevicedetected> yeah, I was able to unlock it from the webinstall
04:43:40 <nodevicedetected> but the download kept failing so I switched over to commandline
04:45:04 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. What do you see when you hit ./flash-all.bat? Any logs...?
04:45:22 <nodevicedetected> its saying:
04:45:35 <nodevicedetected> "./flash-all.bat : The term './flash-all.bat' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or
04:45:35 <nodevicedetected> operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and
04:45:36 <nodevicedetected> try again.
04:45:36 <nodevicedetected> At line:1 char:1
04:45:37 <nodevicedetected> + ./flash-all.bat
04:45:37 <nodevicedetected> + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
04:45:38 <nodevicedetected>     + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (./flash-all.bat:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
04:45:38 <nodevicedetected>     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException"
04:46:03 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, you need to have your environment path set to know where the fastboot executable is.
04:46:12 <TheJollyRoger> Do you know where you downloaded and extracted platform-tools to?
04:46:29 <nodevicedetected> yeah, I ran the "$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"" command
04:46:52 <nodevicedetected> and I checked the fastboot --version which showed me the directory
04:46:53 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wait a minute
04:46:57 <TheJollyRoger> I'm on crack-
04:47:04 <TheJollyRoger> you're not in the correct working directory when you're running the command.
04:47:19 * TheJollyRoger hastily grabs a cup of coffee and pounds it back.
04:47:21 <nodevicedetected> oh?
04:47:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You need to be in the directory where the flash-all script is located.
04:48:07 <TheJollyRoger> You downloaded the image and unpacked it?
04:48:16 <nodevicedetected> Yes
04:48:23 <nodevicedetected> using the provided commands
04:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. You need to change into that directory using the cd command.
04:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> once you do, you can check to see if it's there, with get-childitem flash-all.bat
04:48:55 <nodevicedetected> oh hell
04:48:57 <TheJollyRoger> By default, if you followed the commands off the CLI tutorial, and your device is sunfish,
04:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> this should be "cd sunfish-factory..." with the date.
04:49:31 <TheJollyRoger> cd stands for "Change Directory."
04:49:46 <nodevicedetected> gotcha ill give that a shit
04:49:49 <nodevicedetected> shot*
04:49:51 <TheJollyRoger> Look at your Powershell Prompt, and it will display what your current directory is.
04:50:20 <TheJollyRoger> If you ever get lost, your prompt should tell you where you are as you navigate the seas of your computer's hard drives and SSD.
04:50:52 <nodevicedetected> you're a champ
04:50:56 <nodevicedetected> got the flash started
04:51:19 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Make sure the phone is placed flat on your desk, where it won't fall, and the cables are good and snug before you-- OK!
04:51:34 <nodevicedetected> yeah all that is good :)
04:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> It could take a minute or so. Once it's done, fastboot in powershell should give you a "Finished, press any key to continue" and then return you back to Powershell when you hit space or enter.
04:52:38 <TheJollyRoger> (or any other key)
04:52:50 <nodevicedetected> copy
04:53:07 <nodevicedetected> oh
04:53:09 <nodevicedetected> I think its done
04:53:13 <nodevicedetected> that was quick
04:53:14 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
04:53:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, USB 3.1 is *fast*!
04:53:32 <TheJollyRoger> OK, don't unplug it just yet.
04:53:44 <nodevicedetected> want to lock it back up now I assume?
04:53:44 <TheJollyRoger> You can test the phone to see if it boots, or you can lock the bootloader immediately.
04:53:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. You can optionally boot the device just to see first.
04:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> But *don't* use it as a phone until we lock the bootloader.
04:54:16 <nodevicedetected> okay Ill check it out
04:54:28 <TheJollyRoger> Once it's returned you back to fastboot, you can select start. Now, it's going to give you an orange screen warning about the bootloader being unlocked.
04:54:34 <TheJollyRoger> That's OK -- you should know what that screen looks like.
04:54:46 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to lock it after we see that GrapheneOS boots.
04:54:59 <TheJollyRoger> So it'll display the "Google" logo, then a warning about the bootloader being unlocked, then you'll see "GrapheneOS"
04:55:23 <nodevicedetected> Yessssir, i'm now at the logo with the option for "NEXT >"
04:55:36 <nodevicedetected> guessing I should reboot into bootloader now
04:55:45 <TheJollyRoger> Great! OK! yeah, switch it off and start it back into the bootloader!
04:56:13 <TheJollyRoger> After we lock the bootloader then we're going to boot it up one last time, and once you get through the startup tutorial, we're going to turn OEM unlock back off.
04:56:41 <nodevicedetected> copy
04:56:42 <TheJollyRoger> Once you reach the bootloader, "fastboot flashing lock" and confirming it on your phone should get the lock done.
04:56:52 <nodevicedetected> to get back into the boot tools I want to run "$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"" again no?
04:57:12 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, you don't have to, since it's already been run for this particular powershell instance.
04:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> If you closed Powershell and opened a new one you would, but if you didn't, s we don't have to.
04:57:53 <nodevicedetected> ah okay
04:58:35 <TheJollyRoger> You'll have to confirm it on your phone, once the computer starts the process.
04:58:52 <nodevicedetected> just got it done
04:58:58 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
04:59:16 <TheJollyRoger> This time when you start the device, you'll notice that the orange screen changes to a yellow one with "Your device is loading a different operating system."
04:59:16 <nodevicedetected> Really appreciate the help !
04:59:21 <TheJollyRoger> S'what I'm here for!
04:59:39 <TheJollyRoger> If you see this yellow screen caution, that's a *good* sign because it means the verified boot has now been switched on and is enforcing.
05:01:01 <TheJollyRoger> Every time you reboot your cellphone, the handset will check to ensure the signature on the entire system partition match to the keys the flash-all script gave the bootloader, and if it's damaged, it'll try to revert or roll back the damage automatically if it doesn't match.
05:01:14 <TheJollyRoger> You can skip this screen by double-tapping the power key twice in rapid succession.
05:01:21 <nodevicedetected> sorry im a little distracted at work
05:01:41 <TheJollyRoger> Sure no problem, let me know when to continue, but you're on the home stretch now!
05:01:52 <TheJollyRoger> You're past the most difficult part!
05:03:20 <nodevicedetected> yeah I wasnt paying attention when I booted it the second time x) but thanks for the info about the signature check
05:03:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. We can also check that the keys are the *correct* keys using attestation, which we'll do in a moment.
05:03:44 <nodevicedetected> im through the set up and at the homescreen now
05:04:07 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Ok, the last two steps, and these parts are optional...
05:04:17 <nodevicedetected> looks like its got chrome preinstalled, thats sorta odd no?
05:04:29 <nodevicedetected> and okay no problem!
05:04:30 <TheJollyRoger> The first thing you're going to want to do is go back to developer settings (the same way you did earlier) and slide OEM unlocking to "OFF"
05:04:47 <TheJollyRoger> After which, you'll want to slide Developer options to "OFF" to close that menu.
05:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> Developer options shouldn't be used unless you're debugging the phone. Never use them in production!
05:06:08 <nodevicedetected> done!
05:06:18 <nodevicedetected> should I reboot?
05:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, reboot the phone once it slides to off. The very last step is optional, it's to pair with the Attestation server for integrity self-monitoring at https://attestation.app/tutorial on a computer you trust. Again, this step's optional, but it ensures that you flashed the right image, and the keys are the correct and genuine keys.
05:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> Since we didn't verify via signify (this part can't be done on Windows), the best thing to do is verify afterward.
05:07:43 <TheJollyRoger> er, I mean, signify verification can't be done on Windows - verifying by remote attestation can be done on any device you trust that has a browser.
05:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> So! About Chromium -- actually, pleasant surprise for you there!
05:08:52 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS includes its own hardened browser, called Vanadium, which is a privacy-focused patchset for Chromium, which actually does a lot of neat things - it improves on the sandboxing and security of Chromium, using GrapheneOS' improvements to sandboxing and memory safety.
05:09:14 <nodevicedetected> ah okay I had heard about that
05:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> It's designed to mimic the browser fingerprint of a normal Pixel, but improve on the strictness of the site isolation to mitigate exploits.
05:09:41 <nodevicedetected> I'm probably going to end up using tor, but thats nice that they put that together
05:10:02 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
05:10:12 <TheJollyRoger> It also provides the backend for WebView and PDF Viewer.
05:10:22 <nodevicedetected> oh thats great
05:10:26 <TheJollyRoger> Note that -- Vanadium depends on some GrapheneOS improvements, so it will likely not work elsewhere.
05:11:34 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS comes with its own secure PDF reader, since PDFs often are a security and privacy nightmare.
05:12:20 <nodevicedetected> Yeah ive heard
05:12:26 <nodevicedetected> thats fantastic
05:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
05:12:36 <nodevicedetected> just now getting the auditor app
05:12:44 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
05:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> That's pretty much it for installing GrapheneOS, once you're paired with Attestation Server. Attestation Server will occasionally ping your device every number of hours, and if your device doesn't check in, or checks in wrong, or if the keys change, then Attestation Server can send a "Hold it! Something's not right!" to an E-mail address you want to use.
05:13:43 <TheJollyRoger> (Of course, this E-mail address should not be accessible from the device itself!)
05:14:09 <nodevicedetected> successfully audited
05:14:12 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo!
05:14:18 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship, shipmate!

05:35:24 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web has progress bars now
05:35:34 <strcat[m]> testing it atm
05:36:27 <TheJollyRoger> Woah! Awesomesauce, strcat[m]!
05:39:46 <strcat> so glad Wi-Fi sharing qr code exists
05:39:52 <strcat> for each time I flash this poor Pixel 3a
05:40:03 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha oh no!
05:40:14 <strcat> maybe I should pick a diff device cause I'm gonna kill the shitty NAND it has
05:40:36 <strcat> Pixel 1 moved to UFS 2
05:40:36 <TheJollyRoger> Woah. That... that could actually burn out the NAND chip?
05:40:41 <strcat> Pixel 3a went back to eMMC to be cheaper
05:40:44 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
05:40:44 <strcat> 4a is back to UFS
05:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> OHHHH
05:40:52 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow, I didn't know that.
05:41:45 <strcat> and you can safely assume that it being eMMC means having garbage flash memory, not just a slower interface for it
05:41:54 <TheJollyRoger> Glad that they're no longer using eMMC, then.
05:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> I'm kinda surprised, I thought that eMMC was only used in dime-a-dozen SD and MicroSD cards because those things you fill 'em up and then throw them away. And Teslas.
05:42:51 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: so it's still technically an SSD but... the perf diff is like HDD vs SSD
05:42:57 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez. >_<.
05:43:25 <TheJollyRoger> And Teslas, where failure of a seventy cent part means replacing a $5000 media center!
05:44:18 <strcat> part of why delta updates are important beyond bandwidth
05:44:24 <strcat> minimizing wear of the NAND
05:44:43 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez. Makes sense now.
05:45:56 <strcat[m]> but yeah https://grapheneos.org/install/web now has progress bars so you can tell it's progressing

05:51:05 <strcat[m]> fckmepls: use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
05:51:18 <strcat[m]> fckmepls: Debian doesn't have a proper fastboot package (it's completely broken and horribly out-of-date) and the platform-tools zip we suggest as an alternative is x86

05:53:13 <strcat[m]> fckmepls: should work for you.
06:52:43 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Come to think of it, I wonder if the OEMs ever publish NAND/SSD lifetime estimates? I mean, everything's pretty engineered to stay within a certain amount of write cycles, don't know if they publish that information.
06:53:17 <TheJollyRoger> I think Samsung might have for the nvme drives, but I couldn't find them.
11:35:11 <datacloud[m]> Hi, one short question about the "phone app". I swiched to the dark mode, but the phone app will not support it. Is this normal? Is there another way to get a dark mode phone app?
12:06:46 <nscnt[m]> data.cloud: Yes, that's expected. The Phone app doesn't have support for the dark theme. Of course, if you install an app that supports the dark theme, you will have an app with a dark theme.

16:27:46 <super_noob[m]> Hello everyone. I was here last week looking for help with the  last few steps on installing graphene on a Pixel 3XL. The general consensus  was  that the USB-C  port was not  up  to snuff. (I'm using the original USB-C/USB-C cable  that came with  the phone.)  It was suggested that I try a USB-C/USB-A cable.   Can anyone suggest a quality USB-C/USB-A cable I can buy?

18:15:54 <audrienne_c[m]> hi all, I am new to matrix so excuse me if I do something incorrect or post in a wrong channel (I currently only can see this one). Since a few days my pixel 3XL does not recognize my finger sensor hardware anymore at all (it is not even an option anymore in the settings). If I remember it correctly at one point it said something on the lock screen like "finger sensor hardware not available right now" and I tried
18:15:54 <audrienne_c[m]> to solve it with a restart, which did not work. Now it is not even an option anymore in the settings under Security (also if I search for "finger" in settings nothing shows up). I have really good experience with grapheneOS, so my guess right now is the actual hardware malfunctioned, but I wanted to ask here anyway. Maybe somebody has an idea what the problem could be or it even actually is a software issue (which
18:15:54 <audrienne_c[m]> would be great for me of course, but I do not want to make any claims at all). my build is RQ1A.210105.003.2021.01.23.03.

19:02:27 <kawaiipunk[m]1> Does anyone know what the security of Android is like in this scenario? As I understand it, data is encrypted at rest. Happy to chat in the offtopic room if folks think that more appropriate.
19:03:24 <kawaiipunk[m]1> <scalpol[m] "Hello, I am not sure if this wou"> Are you just looking for an audio player scalpol, If so I recommend looking on the F-Droid store. Vinyl is really good.
19:03:49 <kawaiipunk[m]1> <kawaiipunk[m]1 "Are you just looking for an audi"> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer/
19:04:31 <scalpol[m]> Yep, one with integration with streaming services
19:05:05 <kawaiipunk[m]1> Sorry yeh don't really know. Checkout the F-droid app store and ask in their chat channel.

20:17:46 <m2tu[m]> is anyone experienced in building graphene os ?
20:17:59 <m2tu[m]> i need help
20:19:02 <strcat[m]> methodman: Windows 10 is a fully supported, they shouldn't use another OS, it just makes things more complicated
20:19:24 <strcat[m]> m2tu: building or installing it
20:19:37 <m2tu[m]> building
20:20:05 <strcat[m]> toby3453410: are you following the official guide?
20:20:23 <strcat[m]> toby3453410: consider using https://grapheneos.org/install/web rather than the CLI install since it's easier
20:20:28 <strcat[m]> far less that you can screw up
20:20:52 <m2tu[m]> yes i followed all and alls is fine. i can build it as it is.
20:20:53 <strcat[m]> toby3453410: however, looks like you may not have a reliable USB connection
20:21:24 <m2tu[m]> but the problem if i wnat to edit, forexaple add or remove apps... i dont know where to begin. and when to remove
20:22:41 * m2tu[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gJCvoVkVJqLtaGcuHGlzKFhv/message.txt >
20:23:30 <m2tu[m]> those questions i cannt find nowhere and are stuck!
20:24:07 <strcat[m]> don't remove the directories, just remove the apps from the list of included packages
20:24:14 <strcat[m]> mostly in build/make
20:26:45 <m2tu[m]> <strcat[m] "don't remove the directories, ju"> @strcat:matrix.org:  you mean the build.sh file ? hav the list ?
20:27:26 <strcat[m]> nothing to do with build.sh for building the kernel
20:27:54 <strcat[m]> remove the apps from the list of included packages in the relevant build/make file, clear out/ and rebuild
20:28:20 <strcat[m]> if you just want to get rid of apps consider using the official releases and disabling them in the OS
20:29:05 <m2tu[m]> ok i got that thanks :)))
20:29:38 <m2tu[m]> well im alrde doing it, why i wnat to do is just becuase i wanna learn mor about android and how to modify it.
20:30:07 <m2tu[m]> .. do you know anthing about vendor
20:30:45 <m2tu[m]> can i delete files or edit some .xml there without corrupting the boot ?
20:42:23 <toby3453410> Im using usb c to usb c
20:43:58 <toby3453410> m2tu[m]: usb c to usb c
21:19:41 <matt80> toby3453410 - What about the cable? Sorry, missed earlier part of conversation.
21:20:41 <oldman_newuser> Hello .  When I click 'Settings--> System-->System update settings--> Check for updates' , Should there be a visual feedback that the update check has succeeded ?  Visually it appears to do nothing but I do see traffic  between the phone and releases.grapheneos.org .  I guess I was anticipating ' no updates are available at this time' or 'last
21:20:42 <oldman_newuser> check for updates occured at $date .  thanks
21:22:32 <m2tu[m]> which file shall i edit to remove apps from build ?
21:32:06 <nscnt[m]> oldman_newuser: Yes, there's no feedback currently. It's a planned feature, though.
21:32:41 <oldman_newuser> ty for the response.
21:50:47 <pinguin74> is there an estimation how many devices with grapheneos are in use?
21:51:21 <pinguin74> i guess the download numbers should tell
21:52:14 <m2tu[m]> is there a way to make attestion work wthout having 2 devices ?
22:00:15 <KE345> Hi. I just installed GrapheneOS on Pixel 3. I am new in using this system and have several questions. 1. What is a good email client (from F droid or Aurora store) to run office 365 and iCloud emails without too much privacy compromise? Some apps on Aurora have multiple trackers in permissions (Google, Facebook, etc. I understand that GrapheneOS
22:00:15 <KE345> gets rid of Google services. How affective those trackers can still be? 3. Is the preloaded browser (Vanadium) has better privacy than DuckDuck go browser?
22:02:15 <pinguin74> k-9 mail is a great, free email client without any spying. BUT, if it supports office 365 or iCloud, i dont know
22:02:29 <pinguin74> k-9 mail is on f-droid
22:03:27 <scalpol[m]> <KE345 "Hi. I just installed GrapheneOS "> I tried several options and finally stay with FairEmail, I recommend it. Yes, keep Vanadium over other web browsers, it has security improvements and also uses duckduckgo as web search, so no compromises there.
22:04:40 <m2tu[m]> regarding to browsers, i would suggest using 2 of them. 1 browser for rutined surfs, and one browser if u search much nfo or whatever...
22:04:56 <pinguin74> go to browserleaks.com using vanadium, then use firefox do the same. vanadium tells the website your exact device and OS. firefox does not.
22:05:09 <oldman_newuser> I been using fairemail.  dont know about O365 or Icloud.  Can say that fairemail lets you go pro and allows reinstalls without using google services.  Just provide the email used to go pro and the payment source (paypal ) and my new installs are pro
22:05:47 <pinguin74> best is, use several browsers for different purposes
22:06:35 <m2tu[m]> nstall noroot firewall from aurora!
22:07:32 <KE345> noroot firewall for more detailed permissions management?
22:08:24 <m2tu[m]> You can see if an app request connection and block it
22:08:38 <KE345> I see. Thank you.
22:08:50 <m2tu[m]> also u can block lots of ip whenu open vandium and only accept the known ones.
22:08:57 <pnrxa[m]> <pinguin74 "go to browserleaks.com using van"> This is interesting to me, which would be more effective in fingerprinting the user? Vanadium?
22:11:23 <pinguin74> well... fighting fingerprinting is a battle you can almost not win, if you really want to be safe, you have to use tor-browser. i use vanadium and firefox, they both differ not much in fingerprinting i GUESS, firefox may have more bounds to google and mozilla
22:13:00 <Raoul28394> Yo
22:13:24 <pnrxa[m]> Interesting, thanks
22:13:48 <lumpenqueer[m]> So I was looking at the CLI install instructions, and there seems to be an emphasis on high quality usb cables, and I remember there being a thing about USB 2.0 to USB c not working, is that still a thing?
22:14:01 <Raoul28394> Use usbc
22:14:33 <Raoul28394> Stock cable that came with your device
22:14:48 <lumpenqueer[m]> My computer doesn't have the capability to do usbc-usbc connections
22:15:03 <pinguin74> i installed graphene on a pixel 4a with a usb-c to usb 2.0 adapter, worked flawlessly. but connected directly to PC, no hub
22:15:22 <lumpenqueer[m]> Its most recent port is a usb3 type a port
22:15:24 <m2tu[m]> i use usb 2 works prfct
22:15:44 <Raoul28394> Be cautious and don't skimp on the cable
22:16:08 <Thatcher[m]> You're only as strong as your weakest link.
22:16:26 <KE345> ok. thank you very much everybody.
22:16:30 <Raoul28394> U might get ur phone stuck in a boot loop if u do USB 2.0 but its easy to fix
22:17:18 <m2tu[m]> now the serous question!
22:17:30 <m2tu[m]> does anyon have knowledge about builds ?
22:17:48 <m2tu[m]> anyone here build grapheneos and edited?
22:18:13 <pinguin74> why u want to build yourself?
22:18:19 <Raoul28394> I updated graphene and the com android wallpaper picker shows the default wallpaper but when I pick it it's black
22:18:36 <super_noob[m]> Hey folks. Where can I find he driver to install the  drive  for the pixel 3 XL into windows 10? I  plug in my  phone, and it doesn't  appear under device manager.
22:19:07 <Thatcher[m]> <Raoul28394 "I updated graphene and the com a"> That's normal
22:19:14 <Raoul28394> Cool
22:19:32 <m2tu[m]> <pinguin74 "why u want to build yourself?"> i want to learn , how android works and how to build
22:19:52 <m2tu[m]> i can build but im stuck on removing or adding apps
22:20:37 <pinguin74> ok, but sounds like a hard lesson to learn. no easier way to start with android?
22:20:49 <Raoul28394> Also I installed a third party app off the Aurora store called Twilight, I enabled permissions for it (no WiFi or location ofc) but it disabled the vibration when I touch on the home screen even when I switch it on and off in the settings
22:20:56 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: Firefox does tell the site your device, just less directly, doesn't hide it though
22:21:06 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: i.e. you're misleading yourself
22:21:17 <strcat[m]> and by using an uncommon setup you're more, not less, fingerprintable
22:21:19 <m2tu[m]> its not hard i have lots of background , editing cusotm rooms
22:21:27 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS only supports a few devices so device model is not a high entropy thing
22:21:36 <strcat[m]> using a non-default user agent would be worse
22:21:42 <m2tu[m]> but builds ar diffrrent
22:22:00 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: you're free to enable the 'user agent freeze' feature which will hide that
22:22:03 <strcat[m]> you will be less private
22:22:11 <strcat[m]> but you'll feel better, which seems to be what matters to you, not privacy
22:22:48 <strcat[m]> KE345: fine-grained / per-app network filtering beyond a toggle is fundamentally security theatre and cannot work
22:23:07 <strcat[m]> KE345: simply being able to make DNS queries to the DNS server the OS is using is enough to send data to any party
22:23:37 <strcat[m]> again, all you're doing is making yourself stand out and web sites can enumerate your filtering / blocking rules
22:24:12 <strcat[m]> KE345: if an app or site can connect to anything, that implies having working DNS
22:24:40 <strcat[m]> so, they can try to connect to data_to_exfiltrate.endpoint.their_domain.tld
22:24:54 <strcat[m]> now, this has to look up the address for that domain
22:25:15 <strcat[m]> which sends this query to the authoritative DNS server chosen by their_domain.tld via your configured DNS server
22:25:25 <strcat[m]> sure, you don't connect directly, but it's not like that matters, they can throw an ID into it if they want
22:25:31 <Raoul28394> Can u gain root access on graphene or is that disabled for security purposes
22:25:37 <strcat[m]> data_to_exfiltrate.random_id_made_by_app.endpoint.their_domain.tld
22:25:53 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: it is not 'disabled' but rather is not part of how the OS security / privilege model works in the first place
22:26:11 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: a userdebug (development) build has root via adb shell, a production build doesn't
22:26:20 <pinguin74> in theory you could root using Magisk, but i wouldnt do it
22:26:24 <strcat[m]> root is only used for a few very core processes like init and vold, and even those are contained to some extend
22:26:26 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: no, you cannot
22:26:38 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: if you replace the boot image, you are not using GrapheneOS, as Auditor will let you know
22:26:50 <strcat[m]> if you replace the core of the OS with something else, you aren't using GrapheneOS
22:26:56 <strcat[m]> so, no, you can't
22:27:02 <pinguin74> true. this is not lineageos here ;-)
22:27:18 <strcat[m]> if the bootloader isn't locked, that's not a completed GrapheneOS install
22:27:32 <strcat[m]> you can use Auditor to check if you're running GrapheneOS or not
22:28:05 <r0tt0r[m]> is there anyway the vanadium session data is autocleared i close the browser?
22:28:19 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: use Incognito mode only
22:28:22 <pinguin74> by the way, where do u get the auditor apk ? i guess a non-graphene device can be used as auditor device?
22:28:35 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: Play Store or the Auditor GitHub releases page
22:28:46 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: use Incognito mode only"> hmm indeed,.didnt think of that
22:28:52 <r0tt0r[m]> thx
22:29:39 <pinguin74> vanadium can disable jscript only globally, not per site?
22:35:35 <Thatcher[m]> <pinguin74 "vanadium can disable jscript onl"> Correct. Otherwise you'd have a pop-up each time you visit a site asking if you want to browse without JS, which sounds like a royal pain in the buttocks.
22:36:49 <pinguin74> Thatcher[m]: i use no-script with firefox, for some use cases this makes sense, e.g. you have a working web site and still can block many ads
22:43:05 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: you can disable it globally then enable it for specific sites
22:43:14 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: it's meaningless to enable it with more granularity than that
22:44:18 <strcat[m]> our goals are privacy and security not making people feel better and giving them tools which hurt their privacy by making them unique
22:44:55 <strcat[m]> privacy for browsing is provided through avoiding fingerprinting - which includes avoiding configuration and especially extensions with a bunch of unpartitioned state / configuration
22:45:05 <strcat[m]> and also partitioning the state of each site
22:45:11 <strcat[m]> and properly isolating each site in a separate process
22:45:36 <strcat[m]> and those goals are largely aligned with what the upstream browser is already doing
22:46:01 <Raoul28394> This makes me think of how tails includes ublock origin like is that really a good idea? Stock tor browser bundle doesn't use ublock
22:46:03 <oldman_newuser> Hello.   Should Seedvault allow you to Restore your grapheneos from a Nextcloud backup.  Currently I can backup grapheneos thru Seedvault onto a nextcloud instance but can not restore from nextcloud.  I have been copying the backup to a thumbdrive and restoring that way.  The option for a nextcloud restore is there but it appears to do
22:46:03 <oldman_newuser> nothing.  thanks
22:46:13 <strcat[m]> we ship network isolation key partitioning by default, more of that will get enabled over time, and then what's remaining are cookies which can also be partitioned the same way
22:46:35 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: Tor Browser doesn't use content filtering because it makes it possible to fingerprint you - but anyway Tor Browser has really bad security and site isolation
22:47:07 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: because Nextcloud isn't bundled in GrapheneOS
22:47:24 <strcat[m]> so, yes, to restore you have to copy it from there and restore from a flash drive
22:48:01 <pinguin74> tor browser has bad security by design or by default configuration?
22:51:46 <oldman_newuser> --> because Nextcloud isn't bundled in GrapheneOS
22:51:47 <oldman_newuser> Ty.  Should this information be mentioned somewhere or a issue opened to remove the option to restore from nextcloud.  I am willing to open an issue or a PR for some of the docs, if I understand what action if any you would like to take
22:51:50 <strcat[m]> by design and implementation
22:52:00 <strcat[m]> since it's based on an insecure browser and in particular the LTS branch of it
22:52:22 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: Seedvault is a separate project
22:52:32 <Raoul28394> I wonder what's gonna happen to tor if Firefox dies
22:52:36 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: you're welcome to ask them to make it so the option is grayed out if nextcloud is unavailable
22:52:53 <pinguin74> on a linux box you can confine tor browser and daemon using selinux/apparmor rules. better than nothing....
22:52:57 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: doesn't impact tor itself
22:53:05 <oldman_newuser> ok  .thanks I understand now.
22:53:17 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: no, you can't confine an application that way
22:53:30 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: doesn't work, and no, security theater providing a false sense of security is worse than nothing
22:54:02 <strcat[m]> application sandbox is not the same as a browser renderer sandbox isolating sites from each other meaningfully and some filesystem access control rules do not make an application sandbox anyway
22:54:14 <strcat[m]> the code inside can get out via dbus, pulseaudio, X11, etc.
22:54:19 <strcat[m]> it's not contained
22:54:26 <Raoul28394> I meant the browser based on firefox not the network
22:55:05 <pinguin74> you say you cant confine pulseaudio, dbus etc?
22:55:21 <strcat[m]> they aren't designed for it
22:56:06 <pinguin74> using tabbed browsing with tor browser is a bad habit anyway
22:56:26 <strcat[m]> and beyond that there's a pretty big difference between isolated semantics (which that doesn't provide) and a proper sandbox
22:56:40 <strcat[m]> since if you're just exposing the whole attack surface of the kernel within it that's not much of a sandbox
22:57:24 <strcat[m]> the Chromium renderer sandbox is a much different thing than an application sandbox
22:57:59 <strcat[m]> and when sites are set up securely it provides strong isolation semantics between them where they are guaranteed to be in separate sandboxes
22:58:18 <strcat[m]> and if an attacker gets remote code execution, they don't get access to other site data, etc. without breaking out
22:58:41 <strcat[m]> the weak link is generally the OS kernel - despite all the effort to reduce kernel attack surface to a minimum
22:59:19 <pinguin74> in the end, the safes way seems to be using tails....
22:59:35 <strcat[m]> don't really see how that alleviates any of this
22:59:41 <strcat[m]> still a very insecure browser
22:59:53 <strcat[m]> and if an attacker compromises it they can persistently compromise the computer
23:00:05 <strcat[m]> very few laptops and desktops have any kind of real, meaningful verified boot
23:00:17 <strcat[m]> the attacker can happily flash evil firmware onto the motherboard, SSD, GPU and other components
23:00:29 <Raoul28394> Damn
23:00:51 <strcat[m]> they can reprogram your USB devices if your USB devices weren't designed to be secure and avoid trusting the computer
23:01:42 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: the OS not having persistent state doesn't mean there isn't a ton of unprotected persistent state on the computer / peripherals
23:01:50 <strcat[m]> for an attacker to persist access
23:02:13 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: and unless it's a read-only, secure drive you're booting they could overwrite the OS there
23:02:21 <strcat[m]>  * pinguin74: and unless it's a read-only, secure drive you're booting from they could overwrite the OS there
23:02:26 <strcat[m]> so it'd impact using it on another computer too
23:02:29 <Raoul28394> What about vboot with coreboot
23:02:35 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: what about it?
23:02:48 <strcat[m]> again most laptops / desktops fundamentally do not have support for meaningful verified boot
23:03:00 <strcat[m]> you cannot add it after the fact, they don't have it
23:03:30 <strcat[m]> they don't get firmware updates for long if at all either
23:03:50 <pinguin74> there is one guy from the secure boot scene in linux who works creating what he calls measured boot, using e.g. the help of the tpm
23:04:07 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: doesn't provide any meaningful value on most computers
23:04:23 <strcat[m]> and is not actually usable / practical with the model it uses regardless
23:04:47 <strcat[m]> TPM API is quite awful and the implementations are largely really bad just like other kinds of secure elements
23:04:49 <pinguin74> at least secure boot makes sure you boot the right kernel....
23:04:51 <Raoul28394> Gotta delete the management engine
23:04:55 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: no, it doesn't
23:05:07 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: again, most laptops and desktops do not provide a way to do meaningful verified boot
23:05:21 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: you have been told by marketing/branding that they have that feature, but they don't
23:06:02 <strcat[m]> if it's not a Chromebook or a Windows Secured Core laptop, I seriously doubt that it has anything close to what would be required
23:06:29 <strcat[m]> Microsoft has a standard for computers with some semblance of security model for the firmware, etc. (Secured Core)
23:06:44 <strcat[m]> still probably don't get much in the way of proper firmware updates for much time
23:06:57 <pinguin74> wait, a windows secure core laptop still is standard x86 hardware, right? the same hardware you could use to run your linux box?
23:07:21 <strcat[m]> yes
23:07:39 <strcat[m]> the hardware having some semblance of support for doing it doesn't mean you have it though
23:07:55 <pinguin74> so in other words, the hardware is very well there, with appropriate OS support you could get that level of security
23:08:03 <strcat[m]> no, it's not really
23:08:13 <strcat[m]> it's an early stage of support for having an actual security model for this with laptops
23:08:44 <strcat[m]> and there isn't appropriate OS support
23:08:55 <pinguin74> does MS favour certain brand for their approach?
23:09:00 <strcat[m]> and many devices (SSDs, USB devices, etc.) are not designed securely
23:09:07 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows10-secured-core-computers
23:09:27 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: basically, they have a certification for "this computer doesn't have *completely* shit security"
23:09:32 <oldman_newuser> I was testing out the new web based install and got this error
23:09:32 <oldman_newuser> 'Error: Bootloader replied with FAIL: Requirement partition-exists=product failed, value = undefined'
23:09:33 <oldman_newuser> the phone had just been reflashed with the latest google pixel firmware via their web installer
23:09:50 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: which device
23:10:07 <oldman_newuser> pixel3xl
23:10:10 <Raoul28394> secured core seems neat for sure
23:10:35 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: I don't want to overstate what it provides, it's not like it means it's comparable to what an iPhone or Pixel provide
23:10:39 <strcat[m]> or even a Chromebook
23:10:44 <strcat[m]> maybe some of them are close to a Chromebook
23:10:52 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: it's a weaker certification than that
23:11:05 <strcat[m]> it's worth getting a Secured Core laptop but... don't overestimate what it provides
23:11:34 <strcat[m]> and if you're not using Windows, you're much further away from actually taking advantage of it
23:11:52 <Raoul28394> So u have to contact a sales rep to buy one?
23:11:55 <strcat[m]> since desktop Linux distributions are a lot less secure and have much less progress to verified boot, an application security model, exploit mitigations, etc.
23:12:21 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: pretty sure you can buy one
23:12:35 <strcat[m]> this site is probably not the best place to figure out what you can buy
23:12:44 <Raoul28394> Idk why a lot of ppl assume linux = secure
23:12:57 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "if it's not a Chromebook or a Wi"> Macbooks too
23:13:18 <strcat[m]> yeah, Macbooks are now a lot further along
23:16:24 <strcat[m]> Windows 10 Enterprise on a Secured Core computer has a lot of advantages, and some nice security features - still a huge amount of issues based on it being a traditional desktop OS evolving into a reasonably secure OS, it's not there yet
23:16:44 <oldman_newuser> went to CLI install and it appears the install going to work just fine, just didnt work for me from the web installer.
23:16:53 <Raoul28394> What about the telemetry
23:17:07 <strcat[m]> Raoul28394: what about it?
23:17:26 <Raoul28394> On the secured core would it compromise security
23:17:32 <strcat[m]> no
23:17:40 <strcat[m]> and I don't know why you think it's something specific to Windows
23:18:00 <strcat[m]> do you think desktop Linux distributions don't have telemetry?
23:18:03 <strcat[m]> you're wrong
23:18:09 <Raoul28394> Ik other oses do it
23:18:35 <Raoul28394> I'm still a noob to a lot of this stuff lol
23:18:50 <strcat[m]> non-LTSC Windows 10 Enterprise on a Secured Core computer or an ARM Macbook
23:18:58 <pinguin74> debian may have less telemetry than others....
23:19:48 <strcat[m]> pinguin74: Debian has incredibly weak security and it's still got plenty of telemetry including various upstream implementations of it and their own
23:19:51 <strcat[m]> so, don't know where you get that idea
23:20:05 <Raoul28394> Sudo has many issues
23:20:17 <Raoul28394> I've heard
23:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> pinguin74: Debian's also full of old software that's heavily diverged from upstream and is often missing HUGE numbers of patches.
23:20:20 <strcat[m]> that doesn't seem on-topic
23:20:30 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "non-LTSC Windows 10 Enterprise o"> Is there any detailed info on the security of ARM macbooks? Apple publishes barely anything.
23:20:41 <strcat[m]> traditional Linux distributions are a bunch of fragmented packages developed by different upstreams with no overall source tree / development model
23:20:45 <strcat[m]> no systemic privacy or security work
23:20:47 <strcat[m]> it doesn't fit into it
23:21:04 <strcat[m]> and then the distributions have a whole bunch of packagers doing weird stuff to the upstream projects with lack of familiarity with their code
23:21:29 <strcat[m]> and with Debian you get packages frozen for ages and ages with very limited resources for doing maintenance for them
23:21:39 <strcat[m]> most upstream security fixes don't get a CVE assignment
23:21:49 <madaidan[m]> <Raoul28394 "Sudo has many issues"> Doesn't really make a difference with the broken security model of Linux. It's trivial to get your password for sudo either way.
23:23:03 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: what it impacts is something that's (poorly) isolated such as say, an nginx web server running as a dedicated user/group, which can exploit a vulnerability in a suid binary (or the kernel)
23:23:57 <strcat[m]> i.e. something that doesn't have permission to use it, but can still exploit it
23:24:05 <strcat[m]> but generally nothing is confined even poorly like that
23:24:11 <strcat[m]>  * but generally nothing substantial is confined even poorly like that
23:24:13 <strcat[m]> on a desktop
23:26:52 <strcat[m]> one of the most basic initial steps to making an OS sandbox with the Linux kernel is setting NO_NEW_PRIVS, and you have to set that to use seccomp-bpf as an unprivileged user, so you are already doing it based on the fact that you're using seccomp-bpf to massively reduce kernel attack surface
23:26:56 <strcat[m]> it's a given that you're doing it
23:27:04 <strcat[m]> and NO_NEW_PRIVS disables stuff like suid/sgid
23:29:43 <TheJollyRoger> pinguin74: TAILS is mostly security theatre. Any process that gets an escalation attack via the MASSIVE amount of vulnerabilities in the ancient and outdated kernels it's shipping can simply edit the firewall rules and phone out over the clearnet, leak information via what you're doing... or make calls to System Management Mode for persistence if they want to. It makes power users or people who
23:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> think they're power users feel good about themselves because  of the "hey look I'm doing work and putting in effort, I must be doing good then!" appeal.
23:30:06 <strcat[m]> even if Android had some vulnerability in a suid binary it's not like an app could exploit it
23:30:12 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: what it impacts is so"> The ability to even execute sudo is usually restricted to a specific group through. Normally the sudo/wheel groups, depending on the distro.
23:30:15 <strcat[m]> suid only allowed at all in userdebug for su anyways
23:30:54 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: just checked on Debian
23:30:56 <strcat[m]> it's not
23:31:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the binary is just
23:31:05 <strcat[m]> -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 163K Jan 26 13:34 /usr/bin/sudo
23:31:11 <strcat[m]> nginx could execute it and exploit the vulnerability
23:31:18 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: the vulnerability is BEFORE sudo checks which users are authorized
23:31:35 <strcat[m]> anyway I dunno what people expect from a tool that exists basically to provide security theater
23:31:37 <strcat[m]> it's a stupid tool
23:31:47 <TheJollyRoger> A show and dance, probably.
23:31:56 <madaidan[m]> TheJollyRoger: Tails actually allowed *unprivileged* attackers to easily leak the IP address via the unsafe browser for years. Only recently have they made it into a boot option.
23:32:05 <strcat[m]> just log in as root as a virtual console, don't use su or sudo within another account, or it's just equivalent to root
23:32:14 <TheJollyRoger> madaidan[m]: hohohoooly cow... worse than I thought.
23:32:26 <strcat[m]> their focus is security theater / bikeshedding things like that in the tiny part of the OS they actually deal with
23:32:45 <TheJollyRoger> I guess it makes the Power Users feel better...
23:32:45 <strcat[m]> since really there's no systemic privacy or security work in a traditional Linux distribution
23:32:47 * TheJollyRoger shrugs.
23:32:59 <strcat[m]> they don't take ownership over the code they ship, each project has different approaches and there's a lack of coordination between them
23:33:14 <strcat[m]> and any privacy or security stuff requiring a lot of coordinated and cross-project work that's done in sync just doesn't work out
23:33:18 <strcat[m]> which is most stuff that's valuable
23:34:01 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: the vulnerability is "> Why do they not just place the check at the start? Before the majority of the code.
23:34:05 <strcat[m]> you can't even really have seccomp-bpf policies for a sandbox within your app since that's broken due to not having control over what system calls are used by libc and any other libraries that might be loaded - and it's not like apps and libraries are being written to work within some sandbox
23:34:17 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: because they're the kind of people to make a tool like sudo
23:34:23 <strcat[m]> and who think that's a good idea
23:34:35 <strcat[m]> just login as root at a virtual console
23:34:46 <strcat[m]> and don't have any normal usage of the system require root, that's pretty bad
23:35:00 <strcat[m]> users should be able to install packages that are specific to them etc
23:35:14 <strcat[m]> there should be no fucking reason you need root as a local, physical user at the computer to use a USB device
23:35:24 <strcat[m]> desktop Linux is just an entirely brain damaged thing with no actual security
23:35:31 <strcat[m]> and just a bunch of security theater making your life hard that has no value
23:35:55 <strcat[m]> the people who make these projects are clueless and it's not possible for security engineers to actually work on systemic privacy and security to even start turning it around
23:36:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-as-non-root
23:36:21 <strcat[m]> the fact that I need to have this section
23:36:45 <strcat[m]> how does it make any sense that a user at a local, physical session cannot use a USB device without having root access?
23:37:05 <strcat[m]> without installing a database of hard-wired vendor ids for each kind of USB device they want to use?
23:37:13 <strcat[m]> and there's no ACTUAL security - every application, etc. can use USB
23:37:20 <entry1[m]> I certainly don't want to go down a rabbit hole, but does verified boot prevent the ability for an outside attacker (not local as I wouldn't trust anyone with a device after it was in their hands) compromising the SSD/motherboard/components after a full restart, or could their theoretically still remain some persistence? If I am framing the question too vaguely without any utility to the topic, I will stop speaking
23:37:20 <entry1[m]> about it.
23:37:24 <strcat[m]> try our web installer on Android, the browser has to keep asking for permission from the OS / user to access the USB device
23:37:46 <strcat[m]> i.e. an actual security check (applications can't access USB devices without user consent)
23:37:58 <strcat[m]> vs. security theater (local user with a physical session not allowed to use USB devices without root)
23:38:05 <strcat[m]> entirely different mindsets
23:38:05 <entry1[m]> * I certainly don't want to go down a rabbit hole, but does verified boot prevent the ability for an outside attacker (not local as I wouldn't trust anyone with a device after it was in their hands) compromising the SSD/motherboard/components after a full restart, or could there theoretically still remain some persistence? If I am framing the question too vaguely without any utility to the topic, I will stop speaking
23:38:05 <entry1[m]> about it.
23:38:06 <strcat[m]> about security
23:38:36 <strcat[m]> doing something valuable and having privacy and security as part of the development of the OS where the OS takes responsibility for the code within it and comes up with an overall approach to those things, and components are developed within that
23:38:39 <strcat[m]> vs.
23:38:44 <strcat[m]> useless security theater that harms users
23:39:16 <strcat[m]> like sudo
23:39:39 <strcat[m]> or not letting users with physical access that are logged in access USB devices or a printer without root
23:39:46 <strcat[m]> they can go take the USB device and plug it into another computer
23:39:57 <strcat[m]> or smash it with a hammer (or the whole computer, probably a good idea when it's that bad)
23:40:52 <strcat[m]> entry1: verified boot on a Pixel or iPhone covers all firmware and the whole base OS, that's what a proper implementation does
23:41:01 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat[m] "just login as root at a virtual "> Can one do this over ssh?
23:41:04 <strcat[m]> entry1: and ARM Chromebook implementations can be quite good too
23:41:27 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: the place you are logging in from has equivalent to root access on that computer then
23:41:32 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Can one do this over ssh?"> Because everyone says to disable root login over ssh
23:42:00 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: but sure it makes a whole lot more sense to have an authorized SSH key for root and to log in as root vs. logging in as some other user and using sudo for security theater that makes the system less secure
23:42:05 <TheJollyRoger> entry1[m]: If you're worried about compromised hardware, realistically, there's nothing stopping someone from simply swapping out *your entire device* and replacing it with a counterfeit, but that's not in my threat model.
23:42:06 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: that is just cargo cult security theater stuff
23:42:13 <strcat[m]> disable SSH password login, only allow key-based login
23:42:37 <strcat[m]> disable everything but ed25519 and modern ciphers if you want to reduce attack surface
23:42:38 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yeah was just about to ask if root login with keys is fine
23:42:47 <strcat[m]> pin the host public key with SSHFP + DNSSEC and enable checking it in clients
23:42:59 <strcat[m]> disabling root login... but still using root via sudo? you're just making things less secure, sudo is bad
23:43:20 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: most 'privacy' and 'security' stuff is just cargo cult, harmful stuff
23:43:26 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: makes you worse off
23:44:43 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: and for some local machine, makes a whole lot more sense to login as root only at a virtual console (if at all, it really shouldn't be required for any regular usage)
23:44:59 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: or just accept your account is equivalent to root
23:45:10 <strcat[m]> on a single user machine, all your valuable stuff is probably in your user account anyway
23:45:20 <strcat[m]> so the lack of any application security model whatsoever is what matters
23:45:58 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat[m] "SkyFox [kde.org]: and for some l"> Yeah, I think, NixOS is interesting in that it allows installing packages as a regular user which would be scoped to you
23:46:12 <entry1[m]> It would be so interesting to be able to dock a GrapheneOS device and use it as a "desktop" like the Windows phone aimed to do. I know the program capability would be limited, but with most users simply wanting a web browsing machine that they can email, websurf, and do light document editing/printing. If they wanted to do other applications, they could use a Windows device that never connects to the internet.
23:46:14 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: it benefits you to not have sudo installed so in rare cases like an nginx server where it is poorly isolated at least, it doesn't have that attack surface available
23:46:49 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: but, mostly, it doesn't matter, because there isn't isolation, your data is in your user account, that's what matters
23:47:08 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: and anything with even a basic sandbox is going to have NO_NEW_PRIVS set
23:47:17 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: which prevents suid/sgid
23:47:35 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: so basically you have no security in the first place, so it's not really worth worrying that much about it
23:48:02 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: on a server, makes more sense to avoid having that nonsense and just login as root when you want to do stuff as root (via SSH)
23:48:07 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: and btw pam is pretty bad
23:48:10 <strcat[m]> polkit is horrible
23:48:48 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <strcat[m] "SkyFox [kde.org]: so basically y"> Yeah, well, I am on Windows 10 mainly, so mostly concerned about Linux on servers 😅
23:48:49 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: best not to think about it, the whole platform just needs to be tossed and replaced with something else + only used within isolated VMs
23:49:28 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: yeah so on a Linux server: disable non-key-based login, disable everything but ed25519 keys (host and client) for simplicity, pin the ed25519 host key with SSHFP + DNSSEC, enable checking SSHFP in client config
23:49:49 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: and just login directly as root for doing stuff as root, don't even have sudo, it's a stupid program
23:49:53 <strcat[m]> been saying this for years
23:49:55 <strcat[m]> will keep saying it

23:50:40 <strcat[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: don't really have to disable other key types it's just less attack surface if you do and it's nice to only have to add 1 DNS record for ed25519 host key, not 3
