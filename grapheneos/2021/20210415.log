00:04:33 <snowkitten[m]> I read that the US has to ban import of many covid face masks because they contain graphene which is toxic and causes cancer and other sickness is that true?
00:10:42 <kracklepop[m]> I think you're thinking of canada
00:11:55 <kracklepop[m]> But also, this is off topic, no?
00:21:19 <P-G> I don't think this graphene causes cancer.
00:22:20 <kracklepop[m]> Breathing it in isn't good though apparently, but yeah, not sure about causing cancer.
00:23:45 <P-G> Would it be reasonable to submit a feature request to remove the useless white bar at the bottom of the screen when gesture navigation is enabled?
01:00:39 <grapheneos_user_> <snowkitten[m] "I read that the US has to ban im"> Interesting
01:02:02 <grapheneos_user_> Graphene is amazing apart from toxicity though
01:02:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Which ones?
01:02:24 <grapheneos_user_> The material I mean, not the OS
01:02:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> We do not know which mask is good and which is not.
01:02:33 <grapheneos_user_> OS is great and not toxic either
01:02:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Us Venezuelans.
01:02:56 <grapheneos_user_> Just wear a medical mask, they're generally fine
01:03:17 <grapheneos_user_> Now that I think of it graphene is not used in masks
01:03:25 <grapheneos_user_> Not sure where people get that info
01:03:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Because we are wearing KN-95 masks over here, and my little brother... I do not even know what is that material.
01:04:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> It's an amazing material
01:04:19 <TheJollyRoger> On KN95 masks if I recall correctly, is polypropylene.
01:04:38 <grapheneos_user_> Should probably head to off topic channel
01:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, indeed.
02:02:01 <ahmouse15[m]> So was ipv10 just an April fools joke or an actual draft?
02:03:34 <ahmouse15[m]> Well never mind I was under the impression it could be implemented on top of ipv4/6 but its an entire new spec which is pointless
03:22:20 <somenerd[m]> >Seedvault backups from other operating systems are compatible with GrapheneOS.
03:22:20 <somenerd[m]> Wait, doesn’t seedvault check the OS signing key?
03:22:30 <somenerd[m]> Or something along those lines
04:35:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Somebody is pretending to be me on the matrix  side
04:35:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> They aren't doing a very good job at it
04:35:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> But my only matrix is @anupritaisno1:m.apex.to
04:35:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> So don't trust other accounts
04:42:36 <chaznabin[m]> About the GrapheneOS Launcher:
04:42:36 <chaznabin[m]> Would it be possible to have a notification badge counter (instead of a notification badge dot) for apps such as Telegram, Signal or Phone without it being a security vulnerability?
04:51:35 <lynn_stephenson[> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<clannad> Somebody is pretending"> Really? I just noticed in the #telegram-foss:matrix.org room "Cooooom drop table" guy had your handle in there.
05:16:00 <strcat[m]> chaznabin: don't want to implement that, doesn't have to do with privacy/security
06:30:15 <oversized-dildo1> hi
06:31:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hello
06:36:02 <oversized-dildo1> Any cool updates coming soon?
06:36:14 <oversized-dildo1> I have a feature request
06:36:25 <oversized-dildo1> To be able to create a mass text tool
06:36:41 <oversized-dildo1> To import a list of phone numbers, and to send the complete message to every phone number
06:40:16 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound relevant to GrapheneOS at all
06:40:21 <strcat[m]> we don't develop random apps
06:40:39 <TheJollyRoger> oversized-dildo1 has been banned due to a previous ban evasion.
06:40:58 <strcat[m]> is it adam?
06:40:58 <strcat[m]> sigh
06:41:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir.
07:00:34 <somenerd[m]> >doesn't sound relevant to GrapheneOS at all
07:00:34 <somenerd[m]> Sounds like a feature to spam people
07:03:21 <strcat[m]> we don't take requests to develop apps
07:03:22 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense
07:03:32 <strcat[m]> we do not need to make apps for them to exist and be used
07:03:52 <somenerd[m]> It’s not even relevant to privacy and security lol
07:04:38 <TheJollyRoger> good to see you again somenerd[m]!
07:05:15 <somenerd[m]> Thanks TheJollyRoger, good to see you too!

07:24:14 <strcat[m]> off-topic

07:25:55 <akko> ok, sorry
08:37:18 <k1nk0z[m]> Hi there, I am new to GrapheneOS, never actually ran it. If I don't want to build it on my own, where would I get images for other models then Pixel phones? E.g. for OnePlus 6T
08:38:00 <kayront> k1nk0z[m]: you don't
08:38:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
08:38:38 <k1nk0z[m]> <kayront "k1nk0z: you don't"> bummer. So i need to build it on my own.
08:38:54 <kayront> even then i don't think it'll work k1nk0z[m]
08:39:29 <k1nk0z[m]> <kayront "even then i don't think it'll wo"> I must have nisinterpreted something about the Auditor which works on a lot of models
08:39:35 <k1nk0z[m]> > <@freenode_kayront:matrix.org> even then i don't think it'll work k1nk0z
08:39:35 <k1nk0z[m]>  * I must have misinterpreted something about the Auditor which works on a lot of models
08:39:51 <k1nk0z[m]> So basically for Graphene I would need a Pixel phone?
08:40:02 <kayront> yes, as it says on the list of supported devices.. :p
08:40:49 <somenerd[m]> I believe that Auditor only works on Pixel phones (as the phone being audited), but most phones with Android 7.0+ work as an auditor.
08:40:51 <k1nk0z[m]> OK, gotcha
08:41:09 <k1nk0z[m]> OK, sorry, Just got it all wrong
08:41:27 <somenerd[m]> https://attestation.app/
08:41:36 <somenerd[m]> Suggest rereading the docs here
08:42:21 <k1nk0z[m]> I did but then I just searched for grapheneos on oneplue 6t and it brought up the auditor
08:42:26 <k1nk0z[m]> thanks guys
08:59:46 <strcat[m]> ah, they left
09:00:04 <strcat[m]> was going to explain that we were initially trying to support a lot of devices for Auditor but we don't have the resources to keep doing it
09:00:23 <strcat[m]> so we stopped adding devices to it not supported by GrapheneOS for the time being, we would need significant contributions to keep expanding it
10:48:47 <Guest23529> Hi can anyone help , I have a new pixel 5, from a carrier , I've unlocked the bootloader and tried to flash the phone using the website installer but it seems to get to the fastbootd page and then nothing happens , on the website it is stuck on restarting device, is this normal

12:10:34 <hsanjuan[m]> I have an issue where my voice is not heard by the other party when making calls. When I reboot, the first call works fine. Next ones have the issue again. WIFI calling is disabled. Any tips?
12:32:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> what is your "preferred Network type"?
13:00:01 <p0lp0> i heard from the Google fi people that the Fi app is 'required' for SMS to work reliably - is this true? seems weird
14:24:14 <Connor79> Hello!
14:25:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hi
14:44:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !asrey has joined the Telegram Group!
15:44:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Hmm.
15:45:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Another weird Matrix instance ─ I have heard of some other Matrix instance called monero.social. Where do they come from?
15:56:49 <akko> can we say graphene os is 100% free software?
15:57:39 <lain[m]1> no
15:57:48 <akko> what's not free software in it lain[m]1 ?
15:59:10 <dnull> Chipset firmware mostly.
16:00:16 <akko> that's to be expected and its true even with most desktop computers though isnt it dnull
16:01:10 <dnull> Sure. Which is why libre software is a lost cause for the most part.
16:01:50 <akko> well if one small part of my software has to be closed source, that doesn't mean i'll give up and just don't care about it
16:02:22 <dnull> Then that defeats your original question.
16:02:32 <jj1013[m]> <akko "can we say graphene os is 100% f"> It should be, if we are excluding patents from third-party drivers which is inevitable.
16:02:36 <dnull> No, it's not 100% free
16:02:57 <akko> can we say the chipset firmware is part of Graphene OS itself though dnull
16:03:16 <akko> I'm not sure as i don't have much android knowledge
16:03:17 <dnull> It's part of Android
16:03:22 <dnull> So probably.
16:03:54 <akko> but when it comes to graphene os stuff itself, we can say its 100% free, right?
16:03:57 <dnull> But this is more a topic for -offtopic
16:04:01 <akko> like jj1013[m] said
16:04:22 <akko> i'll join that channel
16:07:22 <jj1013[m]> Closed source software can also be audited, so it is safe to use as long as you know what it is doing. That is why "FLOSS" operating systems such as ReplicantOS are not secure, due to them using outdated drivers. This way, attackers can grab those devices as an easy target.
16:07:46 <jj1013[m]> I have my amd64-microcode package installed on my Debian OS.
16:07:53 <jj1013[m]>  * I have the amd64-microcode package installed on my Debian OS.
16:19:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d​eadlypayload> Hey is there any tutorials on how to build graphene from source. Anything other then whats on website.
16:22:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> What's on the website is the only reliable source you're going to get.
16:22:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> There's nothing wrong with it.
16:23:25 <somenerd[m]> yeah, don't see how other sources can be more reliable
16:24:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d​eadlypayload> Yeah your right , ill get to work i guess there no such thing as to Much info. 😂👍
16:25:09 <somenerd[m]> there may be some AOSP build docs, which could work (download the GrapheneOS sources though)
16:25:22 <somenerd[m]> not sure if they will, the website is your best bet
16:57:21 <hypokeimenon[m]> Maybe if you're successful you could document it in greater detial and then ask if strcpy can give it a review so you can publicise/link it.
17:13:26 <Wags> hey all. I have an obscure question for anyone who might now
17:13:32 <Wags> know*
17:14:52 <Wags> when a new apple/android gets a sim, that study from ireland showed that mac addresses amonsgt other things from nearby devices are all shared with apple. Are our graphene phones immune to this?
17:16:20 <Wags> oops, sorry, this is meant for offtopic
17:18:17 <onyxso> problem when installing grapheneos on a pixel::  can't do anything anymore keeps going in Fastboot and satus device unlocked..   anybody idea
17:40:21 <onyxso> problem when installing grapheneos on a pixel::  can't do anything anymore keeps going in Fastboot and satus device unlocked..   anybody idea
17:44:59 <Wags> leave it in FastbootD until you see in the terminal that its done uploadig
17:45:09 <Wags> then reboot the device
17:45:35 <Wags> what stage are you at?
17:45:55 <Wags> https://grapheneos.org/install/
17:48:31 <onyxso> thanks for reaction but no I added the downloaded package and now it should reboot and give the GrapheneOS opening screen but instead of that I got in Fastboot Mode and can't do annything
17:48:58 <onyxso> too bad I can't add pics here in chat
17:49:09 <Wags> so the package was installed?
17:49:27 <onyxso> I guess yes
17:49:44 <Wags> are you using the terminal or web installer
17:49:53 <onyxso> terminal
17:50:11 <Wags> are you using the appropriate build for the pixel model you have?
17:50:19 <onyxso> but I did it yesterday and after couple hours fighting I went sleep
17:50:20 <onyxso> lol
17:50:26 <onyxso> yes
17:50:30 <Wags> not being a dick, just making sure
17:50:59 <Wags> why dont you try again using the web installer, its so easy
17:51:10 <onyxso> but I had problems in beginning with ads cause have new Mac Pro with m1 chip
17:51:24 <Wags> ahh
17:51:41 <Wags> i just did a pixel 5 lastnight on my intel mac
17:52:01 <Wags> what pixel do you have>
17:52:26 <onyxso> 3a
17:54:01 <Wags> so you have sargo-factory-2021.04.05.20.zip
17:54:23 <onyxso> yes
17:54:28 <Wags> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2021.04.05.20.zip
17:54:35 <onyxso> in fastbootmode also stand
17:54:42 <Wags> you did that command ine?
17:55:07 <onyxso> product revision    cargo MP1.=(ROW)
17:55:45 <Wags> tar xvf sargo-factory-2021.04.05.20.zip
17:56:02 <Wags> do that line next
17:56:17 <onyxso> problem is I can't do anything now
17:56:27 <onyxso> cause terminal no devices
17:56:57 <Wags> sounds like you need to go to terminal and start right from the beginning
17:57:33 <onyxso> I tried wipe phone facury reset but don't help gos again in Fastboot mode
17:58:09 <Wags> you wont need to do a factory reset if you just reinstall Graphene
17:58:37 <Wags> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/d027ce0f9f214a4bd575a73786b44d8ccf7e7516.platform-tools_r31.0.1-darwin.zip

17:59:02 <onyxso> I tought do a full reset and start from beginning but no possibility
17:59:19 <Wags> I am GARBAGE at explaining, but I had to reflash my pixel 4a to staock and it was a nightmare. Bot got thru it
18:00:13 <Wags> if youre unlocked, you should be able to do anything you want to the phone
18:00:17 <onyxso> ok but a
18:00:32 <onyxso> not at terminal
18:00:56 <onyxso> not appear my device
18:01:15 <onyxso> also in Fastboot Mode stands at bottom
18:01:24 <onyxso> device status unlocked
18:01:30 <onyxso> boot slot a
18:01:42 <onyxso> enter reason no valid slot to boot
18:02:12 <Wags> you gotta have it plugged in to a computer
18:02:19 <onyxso> hehe
18:02:25 <onyxso> I have off course
18:02:39 <Wags> ok, sorry, it wasnt clear
18:02:42 <helloworldkk87[m> if it says "no valid slot to boot" then the wrong partition has been flashed.
18:02:52 <helloworldkk87[m> I think
18:03:27 <onyxso> wat can i do about to jus wipe the phone and just to start over again
18:04:30 <Wags> a fresh install will wipe it
18:04:47 <Wags> the process done again from the begining will fix it
18:04:57 <onyxso> how fresh install
18:05:09 <onyxso> like said my phone is not recognized
18:06:11 <onyxso> and start or shut down don't work
18:06:44 <onyxso> and when select  recovery mode or rescue mode then it comes in no command screen
18:06:47 <Wags> and it wont reboot?
18:06:55 <onyxso> with the bot on his back
18:07:11 <Wags> dont use those modes
18:07:31 <onyxso> nothing else wat I can do
18:07:32 <onyxso> lool
18:08:09 <onyxso> now in rescue mode terminal recognise my phone
18:08:31 <onyxso> ojo@jos-MacBook-Pro ~ % adb devices

18:08:50 <TheJollyRoger> onyxso: just use the web flasher.
18:09:24 <onyxso> sorry but wats the web flasher?
18:09:28 <helloworldkk87[m> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
18:09:31 <Wags> yea, im garbage tier at explaining.. but web installer was made for this
18:09:50 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/install/web <- you'll want to use that instead. Reboot your computer first otherwise adb is running in the background and can cause issues.
18:09:52 <Wags> if its recognized... youre good to go
18:10:44 <onyxso> I tried to do that yesterday but somehow it don't work
18:10:59 <TheJollyRoger> Where did it fail?
18:11:11 <TheJollyRoger> If the web installation fails, the CLI method won't work either.
18:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> You must use a supported browser and a supported operating system for it to work: Firefox and other gecko-based browsers view WebUSB as something they don't want and refuse to implement it.
18:12:14 <TheJollyRoger> You need to read everything before you begin, and make sure that you follow the instructions; there are lots of small, fine details that can be big dealbreakers if you don't.
18:12:44 <Wags> chrome / brave work great
18:13:09 <onyxso> aah ok browser maybe the problem
18:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> You also need to make sure you use the original, Google brand cable, or buy a USB 3.1 Gen 1 compliant cable from either Anker or Aukey; most other cables will allow you to charge and transfer data to the device but they are missing the wiring for communicating with low-level debugging interfaces and as a result will not work.
18:13:28 <TheJollyRoger> No hubs, no adapters, no front panels allowed; plug directly into your motherboard.
18:14:04 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, read everything before you begin.
18:14:13 <Wags> ^^^^ listen to this guy
18:14:28 <dnull> Wait...you read FIRST?????
18:15:13 <Wags> i dont think he did, but aw well. might as well help the guy right?
18:15:43 <helloworldkk87[m> <Wags "^^^^ listen to this guy"> Yep Jolly Roger is a legend
18:16:14 <TheJollyRoger> If the process hangs, it's likely your cable unless you're using the google branded cable (if it does, then it could be the USB slots on your device, or firmware support for USB). Most USB cable vendors, as well as motherboard vendors assume that their users will only be ever charging their devices, and using the most common functions that USB supports, but they don't care to wire their USB
18:16:17 <TheJollyRoger> slots to do things like low-level device debugging.
18:16:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, thanks guys! P.-)
18:16:27 <Wags> oh yea. hes helped me tons
18:16:41 <TheJollyRoger> Aw man. I'm glad to know I've helped ye!
18:18:43 <onyxso> I am using usb one both ends directly in to my Macbook without a usb hub
18:19:30 <TheJollyRoger> Great. You're using the Google branded USB cable? (If you bought your cellphone new and in the box, factory sealed, it should come with a white USB-C to USB-C cable and a matching charger, use that one.)
18:23:31 <TheJollyRoger> Gotta run for a bit, will return shortly.
18:26:04 <onyxso> everything goes wrong
18:26:21 <onyxso> even my electricity went down
18:26:22 <onyxso> lol
18:26:32 <TheJollyRoger> Crap, and just as I get called away from the compute.r
18:26:34 <TheJollyRoger> *computer.
18:27:06 <onyxso> I will try do on a other browser ND SEE IF HELPED
18:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> onyxso: I have to run for a bit, but I will return shortly. As long as you have the right cables, the right browser, and the right host operating system, you should be on the right track.
18:27:29 <onyxso> ok thanks a lott
18:28:06 <TheJollyRoger> onyxso: If something goes wrong, once the commands have stopped or you stopped them, you may need to hotplug your device by unplugging it, rebooting it and the computer, and then plugging it back in. This is to make sure that adb server is not running, or you will get an error.
18:28:15 <TheJollyRoger> Because the browser will think that the USB is in use.
18:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> I have to run, but you're more than welcome to stay (in fact, the more the merrier!), and if you have any questions or trouble hopefully I or one of the other channel members will be able to answer your questions on give you a hand. I'll see you when I get back.
18:30:05 <onyxso> ok I do my best now and let you know of the success
18:30:07 <onyxso> hHAHA
19:33:33 <koncrete[m]> Why you always running jollyroger
19:39:04 <Thatcher[m]> Irc users always on the run
19:39:18 <dnull> Heh
19:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> koncrete[m]: I do have a life of my own outside of my IRC client. As much as I love to play pirate, I have to go and take care of my own responsibilities.
19:43:26 <dnull> TheJollyRoger: What is this "life" you speak of?
19:45:37 <TheJollyRoger> dnull: School, work, plundering the Spanish Treasure fleet, fleeing the Royal Navy, getting drunk at taverns and staggering from brothel to brothel...
19:45:49 <TheJollyRoger> Usual stuff.
19:46:57 <koncrete[m]> Usual
19:48:22 <kuhonlp[m]> Can somebody let me know the sdk level of bundled default apps in system. You can check that with this app. Trying to verify something in my build.

19:54:35 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy kuhonlp[m], I think I'll have to get back to you on that later, although someone else more knowledgeable than I might be able to answer you faster than I.
19:55:01 <ananteris[m]> ayyy lmao i hate google framework services
20:04:48 <r0tt0r[m]> <ananteris[m] "ayyy lmao i hate google framewor"> for me the exact moment i realized they have to vanish for good was, when suddenly new apps got installed with consent, notice or whatsoever

20:05:20 <kuhonlp[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ahoy kuhonlp, I think I'll have "> Ahoy :) no probs. Not much insight needed though. Sdk monitor app just shows the sdk level of every app immediately after opening it. Just enable these two settings and post the list of system apps below sdk30 whenever you got some time. 🙂

20:16:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hi kuhonlp[m], just one moment.
20:18:14 <TheJollyRoger> kuhonlp[m]: According to this app, the wallpaper app is compiled for 23. A few of the AOSP apps are compiled for 28. Tethering, system tracing, and the CA Certificates are for 29. Everything else is 30.
20:24:05 <gojiboji> Where can I get the vanadium icon png?
20:24:31 <TheJollyRoger> kuhonlp[m]: 23: com.android.wallpaper. 24: Messaging. 28: Camera, com.android.ctsshim (only for CTS), com.android.cts.priv.ctsshim (only for CTS), com.qti.qualcomm.datastatusnotification, GrapheneOS Keyboard, Module Metadata, vendor.qti.iwlan. 29: Android OPen Source Music Player, Bluetooth MIDI Service, CACertApp, CNeApp, Clock, Calendar, com.google.android.accessibility.talkback, contacts,
20:24:34 <TheJollyRoger> Gallery, org.codeaurora.ims, Permission controller, Safety & regulatory manual, System Tracing, uceShimService. 30: everything else.
20:26:33 <TheJollyRoger> gojiboji: Just a minute and I'll retrieve it.
20:28:49 <TheJollyRoger> gojiboji: Oh well, crap. It looks like you'll need to recreate it.
20:29:15 <TheJollyRoger> gojiboji: you can do so, by changing the official art of chromium to grayscale, then reducing the gamma by 0.5.
20:29:20 <TheJollyRoger> Hope this helps!
20:34:19 <kuhonlp[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Gallery, org.codeaurora.ims, Per"> Thanks a lot for taking the time to check. 🤗
