00:01:28 <D66> hello, i'm trying to install the rom on a pixel 4a. i'm running into the "unable to claim interface" error midinstall. Can someone help me navigate this situation?
00:02:40 <D66> i'm using google chrome as web browser for the install btw, and i followed all directions leading up to the Flash section
00:04:33 <akc3n> D66, may need to get a better cable or use a different port on your computer.
00:05:53 <akc3n> D66, which OS are you using?
00:06:51 <D66> akc3n, I'm using debian 10. trying a dif usb port now
00:07:37 <akc3n> D66, and you installed the android-sdk-platform-tools-common package?
00:08:25 <D66> akc3n, yeah. i've downloaded the rom using this computer before. didn't run into this issue before. not sure why it's popping up now
00:11:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Privateer Monkey> I am actually a chimpanzee, but udev issues are what messed me up on Debian. I used git clone from lineage tutorial and that was that.
00:14:45 <akc3n> Use only the official guide, it shows how to do it here https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#standalone-platform-tools
00:15:12 <akc3n> @Privateer Monkey ^
00:31:15 <strcat[m]> make  sure ADB isn't running
00:31:27 <strcat[m]> or other things that may claim the interface
00:31:33 <strcat[m]> reboot and make sure that stuff isn't running
00:32:22 <strcat[m]> our install guides fully cover things like needing to deal with udev on the supported OSes to work around their broken security theater approach to USB security, etc.
00:48:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy lackshan[m]! Glad to have you onboard.
00:50:59 <lackshan[m]> Thanks!
00:53:28 <TheJollyRoger> I'm unfortunately not a developer at this point, so I can't provide much help with building at this point in time. A few of our guys have been able to figure out how to get GrapheneOS to run on the Android Emulator (for testing/debugging use only!), which might help, but I'm not privvy to that at this point in time.
00:53:52 <TheJollyRoger> I do know that it has been done, hopefully you'll find some answers here!
01:01:07 <TheJollyRoger> In the meantime, welcome aboard!
01:14:54 <lackshan[m]> TheJollyRoger I'll take a crack at building it over the weekend. Good idea with using the Emulator, might save me the trouble of repeatedly reflashing my phone.
03:15:03 <bastinjasvi11[m]> Hello. Is it possible to change device password which I configured on lockerapp ? Pass whivh on X wrong attempts deletes all. I was testing and I put nonsafe password because I was thinking it is easy to vhange. Do I need to do factory reset or there is the way ?
03:17:44 <strcat[m]> don't really know what you mean
03:17:49 <strcat[m]> doesn't really sound like a GrapheneOS question
03:18:03 <strcat[m]> recommend against using third party devices managers

09:59:10 <kayront> so i'm having some trouble understanding how android >9 FBE is better than FDE. before, using some incantations i don't even remember anymore, set a very long password using vdc as root, and on every boot i needed to decrypt the storage with that gigantic password. and during normal usage, wrong input of the PIN/pattern/wtv would reboot the device after 3 times .. with android 11 it seems the only thing protecting the data crytographically is
09:59:10 <kayront> the pin? that's much easier to bruteforce, no ? so I understand that's where features like not detecting new USB devices while screen is locked come from (keyboard emulators for bruteforce, for example).. but isn't it possible to access the internal storage directly if you have the right hardware tools, and bypass any software protections that exist? then bruteforcing a 4 or 6-digit pin should be easy enough
10:01:50 <strcat[m]> start by reading the docs
10:01:55 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
10:02:00 <strcat[m]> and this channel is for GrapheneOS only
10:02:58 <strcat> if you want a passphrase, set a passphrase
10:03:17 <strcat> suggest reading the planned roadmap and docs
10:04:41 <strcat> you're totally wrong about how it works and how it compares to the previous way of doing things

10:58:23 <jalb> Hello, is it safe in GrapheneOS to use only the digital fingerprint when I login in each profile? thanks
10:58:42 <jalb> Or it's better to use pin or password instead?
11:28:12 <came2complain[m]>  use 2FA - fprint AND pin / pass
11:32:12 <somenerd[m]> I don
11:32:25 <somenerd[m]>  * I don't think that that's been implemented
11:32:34 <somenerd[m]> or did it?
11:34:23 <GhostSplinterSix> I would use a password. Make it complex, even if that makes the device less convenient for you to immediately access. If records of your fingerprint or face, or iris, are compromised, attackers could use it to bypass all of your accounts, and you can't realistically reset your face or your fingerprints.
11:34:27 <jalb> came2complain[m], I don't think it's necessary all those
11:34:34 <somenerd[m]>  * or has it?

11:37:23 <somenerd[m]> > and the same account for all the profiles or it's really necessary a differente one¿
11:37:23 <somenerd[m]> same password?
11:37:33 <jalb> yes, sorry: same password
11:37:48 <somenerd[m]> it's explained over here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
11:37:54 <jalb> okthanks
11:38:22 <somenerd[m]> > Even if you use the same passphrase for multiple profiles, each of those profiles still ends up with a unique key encryption key and a compromise of the OS while one of them is active won't leak the passphrase. The advantage to using separate passphrases is in case an attacker records you entering it.
11:38:55 <taabcndefodvgkry> I am using GrapheneOS on my phone and I need to switch to stock android, however I can't seem to connect my phone to my computer over adb.

16:06:16 <xrimsn> There is a recent security issue with Qualcomm MSM Soc
16:06:23 <xrimsn> Security probe of Qualcomm MSM data services
16:06:24 <xrimsn> May 6, 2021
16:06:24 <xrimsn> Research By: Slava Makkaveev
16:06:25 <xrimsn> Introduction
16:06:25 <xrimsn> Mobile Station Modem (MSM) is an ongoing series of a 2G/3G/4G/5G-capable system on chips (SoC) designed by Qualcomm starting in the early 1990s. MSM has always been and will be a popular target for security research because hackers want to find a way to attack a mobile device remotely just by sending it a SMS or crafted radio packet. But 3GPP
16:06:26 <xrimsn> protocols are not the only entry point into the modem. Android also has an ability to communicate with the modem processor through the Qualcomm MSM Interface (QMI).
16:06:26 <xrimsn> MSM is managed by the Qualcomm real-time OS (QuRT) that cannot be debugged or dumped even on rooted Android devices. QuRT’s integrity is ensured by the TrustZone. There is only one possible way to dynamically probe the modem, namely to use a vulnerability. There have been several successful attempts to patch the QuRT by exploiting vulnerabilities
16:06:29 <taabcndefodvgkry> I tried three USB cables & both ports
16:07:36 <taabcndefodvgkry> Still "No devices available"
16:08:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> xrimsn: this is off-topic, please read the rules
16:09:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> taabcndefodvgkry: seems like you're doing something wrong
16:10:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Are you using Chrome?
16:10:56 <taabcndefodvgkry> Tried on both Brave & Chrome
16:12:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And your Mac comes with a USB C?
16:12:52 <taabcndefodvgkry> Two USB C ports
16:13:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Here's my suggestion
16:13:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> 0. Backup all your data on the phone
16:14:04 <taabcndefodvgkry> I already backed it up and factory reset it
16:14:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> 1. Factory reset your GrapheneOS
16:14:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeah, factory reset it again
16:14:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And stay over
16:14:45 <taabcndefodvgkry> I did it just an hour ago
16:15:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Are you sure, you don't have any other instances of adb interfering with this?
16:15:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Your browser should be three only one using adb
16:15:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If you have some other programs that can do adb, delete them
16:16:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You don't even need any extra packages, just the browser
16:16:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> There should not be any Android development told on your Mac at all
16:16:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> tools*
16:17:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Your browser should be the only one using adb
16:21:40 <taabcndefodvgkry> I deleted all other dev tools
16:22:09 <taabcndefodvgkry> How do I add adb from a folder to bin?
16:23:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That is what I don't know
16:24:51 <taabcndefodvgkry> Just trying ./adb devices from that folder doesnt work
16:24:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Btw, we should really move this to off-topic room
16:25:11 <taabcndefodvgkry> ok let's do that
16:29:06 <Gladox114[m]> Is the permission for sensors and network a Graphene OS feature?
16:29:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yes

16:29:57 <Gladox114[m]> I asked because I couldn't remember what stock OS had and I want to double know this by asking so I don't tell random people fake news

16:39:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Or, if you have telegram, pm me
16:40:27 <doittoit[m]> After flashing coral on pixel 4xl, I clicked "remove non stock key", it confirmed, but booted up with GOS still
16:40:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Off-topic room
16:46:49 <doittoit[m]> Anyone free?
16:48:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> doittoit[m]: I'm politely asking you to move to the off-topic room, as your y violating the rules
16:50:01 <doittoit[m]> Yikes. I thought you were talking to another person. This is a strictly GOS question. Am I misunderstanding room topics? I will head over there.
17:05:44 <bradgarlinghouse> If I choose to activate the backup function with the 12-word recovery seed, what sort of data will be stored? And where will it be stored?
17:08:34 <Baba[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> Yes"> What all sensor permissions can we toggol off?
17:11:17 <djentosaurus[m]> Okay guys, I am new here and also new to smartphones. I just bought a Pixel 3a phone to install GrapheneOS. I followed every step but when I pressed Flash release I get an error midway the installation. the phone is unlocked by the way. grapheneOs is not installed and the Google OS is deleted so I don't have anything on the phone now. I am on the virge of trashing everything in sight. I've been getting this to
17:11:17 <djentosaurus[m]> work for about 15 hours now.
17:12:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Don't panic, if you're following the web-installer then your phone if not bricked
17:12:10 <dnull> And the error is?
17:12:14 <NikopolSohru> Are Google Pixels the only supported smart phones by Graphene OS?
17:12:23 <dnull> NikopolSohru: Yes.
17:12:36 <NikopolSohru> dnull: How unfortunate.. :(
17:12:39 <djentosaurus[m]> a transfer error occured
17:12:52 <NikopolSohru> (for me, that is)
17:12:54 <dnull> NikopolSohru: You're welcome to port it.
17:13:18 <NikopolSohru> That would be an option.
17:13:21 <dnull> djentosaurus[m]: Have you attempted a cli install?
17:13:33 <djentosaurus[m]> dnull, what do you mean?
17:13:45 <djentosaurus[m]> I relly don't know anything about smartphones
17:14:10 <NikopolSohru> cli = command line interface
17:14:23 <djentosaurus[m]> that's chinese to me
17:14:29 <NikopolSohru> bash?
17:14:31 <NikopolSohru> terminal?
17:14:38 <djentosaurus[m]> the phone is now stuck on fastbootd
17:14:48 <NikopolSohru> shell?
17:14:49 <dnull> djentosaurus[m]: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
17:15:02 <bizanon[m]> Is it possible to run graphene OS on android SDK emulator?
17:16:26 <djentosaurus[m]> What will that cli install do?
17:16:41 <djentosaurus[m]> I'm so sick of reading
17:17:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> let me help you, step-by-step
17:18:00 <djentosaurus[m]> I read somewhere tha a usb to usb c cable should be usb 2.0 and not 3
17:18:14 <djentosaurus[m]> I only have usb 3 on my laptop
17:18:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> djenstosaurus[m]: which OS are you using to install GrapheneOS
17:18:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ?
17:18:32 <djentosaurus[m]> but I am using a usb c to usb c cable
17:18:43 <dnull> bizanon[m]: Not that I've heard of.
17:18:55 <djentosaurus[m]> None anymore, because the OS is gone...
17:19:03 <djentosaurus[m]> It was android I think
17:19:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Your PC I mean
17:19:15 <djentosaurus[m]> what is the operating system for a google Pixel?
17:19:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And please stop spamming
17:19:23 <djentosaurus[m]> that's the OS I had
17:19:37 <djentosaurus[m]> Windows 10 home
17:19:44 <djentosaurus[m]> on my pc
17:20:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Which browser?
17:21:05 <Pratyush[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "Windows 10 home"> Windows is supported for flashing gos if are asking about that.
17:21:22 <djentosaurus[m]> I used the Edge browser
17:21:39 <djentosaurus[m]> It was working untill i got the error message
17:21:57 <djentosaurus[m]> I was super siked untill I got the error
17:22:12 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: What was the message?
17:22:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Please re-read this section https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
17:22:28 <djentosaurus[m]> a transfer error has occured
17:22:44 <djentosaurus[m]> I know Hulk
17:22:55 <djentosaurus[m]> I was already doing it from that website
17:23:23 <Pratyush[m]> no problem just let us know the error message we can help you with that
17:24:54 <djentosaurus[m]> for the 3th time: the error message = a transfer error occured...that's it
17:25:43 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Sounds like a bad connection. Try a different cable/port
17:26:00 <djentosaurus[m]> already bought a new cable
17:26:02 <djentosaurus[m]> no luck
17:26:21 <Pratyush[m]> do you have another pc or laptop ?
17:26:28 <djentosaurus[m]> I bought the phone second hand
17:26:32 <djentosaurus[m]> maybe he fucked me
17:26:54 <djentosaurus[m]> I have another computer yes
17:27:07 <Pratyush[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "I have another computer yes"> try that if possible
17:27:13 <cx7dd[m]> I have a question about the downgrade protection.
17:27:13 <cx7dd[m]> Does the new BUILD_TIME has to be greater or greater-equal than the current one?
17:27:24 <djentosaurus[m]> it's in my bedroom connected to a tv...so that's not the best setup
17:27:56 <djentosaurus[m]> But I'll try
17:28:06 <djentosaurus[m]> that computer also doesn't have usb c
17:28:10 <djentosaurus[m]> only usb 2 and 3
17:28:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You can also use another Android phone with usb C port to install GrapheneOS on your pixel
17:28:38 <djentosaurus[m]> My usb c cable is connected to my thunderbolt port
17:28:44 <djentosaurus[m]> It seems to work
17:29:07 <djentosaurus[m]> It was charging before
17:31:33 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Use an USB port
17:31:48 <djentosaurus[m]> usb 3?
17:32:03 <nscnt[m]> Just try it
17:32:26 <djentosaurus[m]> ash it one more time with usb cI will, I am just trying to fl
17:32:49 <djentosaurus[m]> I will, I am just trying the flashing one more time now with usb c
17:34:41 <djentosaurus[m]> doesn't work
17:34:45 <nscnt[m]> You've got several suggestions to change cables/ports because it sounds like a bad connection, and you tell us you plugged it into a Thunderbolt port...
17:34:48 <djentosaurus[m]> exact same eroor
17:34:51 <djentosaurus[m]> error
17:35:29 <djentosaurus[m]> nscnt...I'll try other connections
17:35:47 <djentosaurus[m]> But the unlocking worked when it was connected to a thunderbolt port
17:35:54 <djentosaurus[m]> after lots of attempts
17:37:06 <Pratyush[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "But the unlocking worked when it"> unlocking does not required a lot of data transfer that't why you are getting "a transfer error occured...",
17:38:13 <djentosaurus[m]> I tried the usb to usbc cable but it won't recognise my device
17:38:52 <djentosaurus[m]> no compatible devices found
17:38:57 <djentosaurus[m]> when I try to flash it
17:39:14 <djentosaurus[m]> Connected it to a usb 3 port
17:39:52 <Pratyush[m]> <djentosaurus[m] "I tried the usb to usbc cable bu"> djentosaurus: may be other pc will, if you have other decent cable you can try that.
17:40:04 <djentosaurus[m]> I bought 2 new cables
17:40:16 <djentosaurus[m]> 1 usb to usb c  1 usb c to usb c
17:41:21 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Please just start the guide from the beginning again if you've changed the connection now
17:49:46 <djentosaurus[m]> I could to that if I have an operating system on my phone
17:50:03 <nscnt[m]> You don't need an OS on your phone to do it
17:50:06 <djentosaurus[m]> the usb to usb c cable doesn't detect my phone on my other pc
17:51:26 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Use the PC you used before. We know you have the needed drives etc. there
17:52:06 <djentosaurus[m]> So can you give me a step by step guide then please because I am going nuts here
17:52:09 <nscnt[m]> *driver
17:52:11 <nscnt[m]> *drivers
17:52:37 <djentosaurus[m]> I thought this would take 15 minutes, not 15 hours (and counting)
17:52:50 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: On the PC you used before, start here again: https://grapheneos.org/install/web#booting-into-the-bootloader-interface
17:53:19 <djentosaurus[m]> the phone is already unlocked
17:53:26 <nscnt[m]> Start there again
17:53:28 <nscnt[m]> do it
17:53:34 <djentosaurus[m]> fuuuuck
17:53:43 <djentosaurus[m]> how many times do I need to do this
17:53:45 <djentosaurus[m]> jeez
17:54:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Dylly (@D​ylly) has joined the Telegram Group!
17:55:36 <djentosaurus[m]> I can't do anything on the web installer
17:55:43 <djentosaurus[m]> I can't click on anything
17:55:48 <djentosaurus[m]> it's greyed out
17:55:59 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: What browser do you use?
17:56:39 <djentosaurus[m]> right...should be Edge and not Firefox (to make things even more difficult I guess)
17:56:52 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Yes, you need to use a browser that supports WebUSB
17:57:00 <djentosaurus[m]> no compatibel devices found
17:57:00 <m4g3nt4[m]> Use Chromium
17:57:06 <djentosaurus[m]> (edge)
17:58:00 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: You're booted into the bootloader interface and connected, right? If you click on "Unlock bootloader" there should be a pop up on the top left to select the device
17:58:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> m4g3nt4[m]: I'm politely asking you not to interfere
17:58:32 <djentosaurus[m]> I am in fastboot mode now
17:58:41 <djentosaurus[m]> it says its unlocked
17:58:46 <nscnt[m]> Good
17:58:58 <nscnt[m]> Well...
17:59:00 <djentosaurus[m]> error
17:59:08 <nscnt[m]> Press the Unlock bootloader button again
17:59:13 <nscnt[m]> You should start there
17:59:15 <djentosaurus[m]> unable to claim interface
17:59:27 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: You probably have another window open with it
17:59:38 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Close every other tab with it
18:00:16 <djentosaurus[m]> bootloader is already unlocked
18:00:31 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: That's what the button says?
18:00:35 <djentosaurus[m]> I get that message
18:00:39 <djentosaurus[m]> yes
18:00:49 <nscnt[m]> Okay, proceed with the next step
18:01:03 <djentosaurus[m]> the release is already downloaded
18:01:13 <nscnt[m]> Press it again
18:01:20 <nscnt[m]> Do it step by step...
18:01:57 <nscnt[m]> If it's already downloaded, it won't be downloaded again. It could be purged already, idk
18:01:57 <djentosaurus[m]> I can't
18:03:10 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Well, I assume it's still already downloaded then. Go to the next step which should be flashing the release
18:03:22 <djentosaurus[m]> that's where the thing goes wrong
18:03:29 <djentosaurus[m]> I tried it 10 times already
18:03:41 <djentosaurus[m]> it's starting the process, but midway I get the errorµ
18:04:20 <nscnt[m]> Has an error occurred again now?
18:04:30 <djentosaurus[m]> i am waiting on it
18:04:40 <djentosaurus[m]> unpacking images

18:07:51 <djentosaurus[m]> AGAIN
18:08:35 <djentosaurus[m]> completely stuck
18:08:41 <nscnt[m]> just wait
18:08:48 <djentosaurus[m]> I did that already
18:09:02 <djentosaurus[m]> It's gonna give me a timeout or something in those lines
18:09:48 <dnull> Pastebin maybe?
18:09:59 <djentosaurus[m]> what's that?
18:10:28 <dnull> You paste the output to a website rather than flood a channel.
18:10:38 <Foxtrek_64[m]> What browser are you using, out of curiosity?
18:10:46 <djentosaurus[m]> Edge
18:10:59 <djentosaurus[m]> I don't know what you are talking about dnull
18:11:16 <dnull> Have you tried with a different browser?
18:11:21 <dnull> Firefox?
18:11:25 <djentosaurus[m]> no not realy
18:11:31 <djentosaurus[m]> i only have firefox and edge
18:11:34 <dnull> Try.
18:11:38 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
18:11:39 <nscnt[m]> No
18:11:43 <nscnt[m]> Firefox won't work
18:11:44 <djentosaurus[m]> no?
18:11:50 <djentosaurus[m]> I'll try Opera
18:11:54 <nscnt[m]> Edge is fine
18:11:54 <djentosaurus[m]> Or Chrome
18:11:57 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Opera is not supported either.
18:11:58 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
18:11:59 <nscnt[m]> It's not a browser issue
18:12:09 <djentosaurus[m]> I don't think so either
18:12:36 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I ask because I ran into an issue using a chromium-based os that wasn't supported. Just wanted to make sure it wasn't a similar situation.
18:12:58 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: I hope you've plugged it in an actual USB port now?
18:13:06 <djentosaurus[m]> still stuck on writing vendor
18:13:13 <dnull> I used Qubes, not the OS.
18:13:21 <djentosaurus[m]> at the exact same spot as usual
18:13:36 <djentosaurus[m]> No nscnt
18:13:36 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: and that was the Thunderbolt port?
18:13:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> djentosaurus[m]: do you have a different android device with a USB C port?
18:13:47 <djentosaurus[m]> It won't recognise my device with usb
18:14:01 <djentosaurus[m]> no, I don't have that
18:14:10 <djentosaurus[m]> this is the first smartphone I have
18:14:45 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Have you tried the USB port and starting from the begging like we did just now?
18:14:53 <nscnt[m]>  * djentosaurus: Have you tried the USB port and starting from the beginning like we did just now?
18:14:58 <djentosaurus[m]> I tried
18:15:11 <nscnt[m]> Being in the bootloader interface and connected?
18:15:18 <djentosaurus[m]> error: timeout of 10000ms exceeded
18:15:31 <djentosaurus[m]> Let me try again
18:16:02 <nscnt[m]> Always start here https://grapheneos.org/install/web#booting-into-the-bootloader-interface
18:16:25 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
18:16:30 <djentosaurus[m]> I am connected with usb now
18:16:32 <nscnt[m]> It's good to make sure the connection is somewhat fine
18:16:35 <djentosaurus[m]> and it's working
18:16:44 <nscnt[m]> okay, go step by step
18:16:44 <djentosaurus[m]> for now
18:16:45 <nscnt[m]> you know how to
18:16:50 <nscnt[m]> go for it
18:16:56 <djentosaurus[m]> doing it
18:18:04 <djentosaurus[m]> the phone is already unlocked and the software is already downloaded. the only thing I can do is flash release
18:18:08 <djentosaurus[m]> am doing that now
18:19:31 <djentosaurus[m]> It's working I think!
18:19:54 <bizanon[m]> Can I ask what does this mean? How to get it from source tree?
18:19:54 * bizanon[m] uploaded an image: (43KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wtuKAKTDRouAXrQLYYGicLgr/IMG_20210507_141921.jpg >
18:20:10 <djentosaurus[m]> The flashing has worked
18:20:24 <djentosaurus[m]> Do I need to lock bootloader now?
18:20:44 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Step by step. Yes
18:22:37 <djentosaurus[m]> On my phone now it says if you lock the bootloader, you will not be able to install custom operating system software on this phone
18:22:44 <djentosaurus[m]> is that normal?
18:22:57 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: yes
18:23:02 <djentosaurus[m]> it also gives me the option on my phone to lock the bootloader or not
18:23:24 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Choose lock it
18:23:56 <djentosaurus[m]> I am in fastboot mode now
18:24:04 <djentosaurus[m]> and it says it is locked
18:24:11 <djentosaurus[m]> what do I do now?
18:24:22 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: Following the next steps
18:25:03 <djentosaurus[m]> YES!!!!!
18:25:26 <nscnt[m]> "Booting", then "Disabling OEM unlocking" and if you want to "Verifying installation"
18:26:01 <nscnt[m]> It really could have been just a matter of 10 minutes. You've not made it easy for us
18:26:16 <djentosaurus[m]> My apologies
18:27:37 <djentosaurus[m]> do you want to use cellular data during setup?
18:27:42 <djentosaurus[m]> Do I need this?
18:28:12 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: As you wish. You don't have to
18:28:26 <djentosaurus[m]> what is it?
18:28:40 <nscnt[m]> Mobile data?
18:30:14 <djentosaurus[m]> what do you guys suggest?
18:30:16 <djentosaurus[m]> on or of?
18:30:31 <djentosaurus[m]> i am a noob with this stuff
18:30:51 <nscnt[m]> You can turn it on later if you want it
18:30:58 <nscnt[m]> or need it
18:31:07 <djentosaurus[m]> okay
18:31:15 <nscnt[m]> You can always turn it on/off
18:31:31 <djentosaurus[m]> location services on or off?
18:32:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Lol, is it really the first time that you're setting up a phone?
18:32:22 <djentosaurus[m]> yes
18:32:25 <nscnt[m]> That's just the global toggle. Every app needs to ask for the permission anyway, but you can turn it on/off globally with that toggle
18:32:28 <djentosaurus[m]> i always hated smartphones
18:32:31 <bizanon[m]> Bro are u trolling us
18:32:33 <djentosaurus[m]> but i need one now
18:32:35 <djentosaurus[m]> no
18:32:48 <djentosaurus[m]> I have an old nokia as my main phone
18:35:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, turn location services off for now, you can always change it later
18:35:48 <djentosaurus[m]> Okay, everything seems to work now
18:35:53 <djentosaurus[m]> thank you so much nscnt!!!
18:36:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Good job nscnt👍
18:38:58 <nscnt[m]> djentosaurus: We have #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org if you have GrapheneOS-unrelated, general questions as a new smartphone user

18:53:27 <Foxtrek_64[m]> Does Graphene include work profile support? I'm wanting to install Shelter to isolate a few apps.
18:54:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you don't need that
18:54:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read this https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
19:01:04 <Pratyush[m]> <Foxtrek_64[m] "Does Graphene include work profi"> afaik Graphene does not recommend using work profile instead use user profile,
19:01:15 <bizanon[m]> is it possible to install grapheneos image to android studio avd (android virtual device)?
19:01:57 <Pratyush[m]> <bizanon[m] "is it possible to install graphe"> you can build an emulator from sources.
19:02:47 <Pratyush[m]> > <@bizanon:matrix.org> is it possible to install grapheneos image to android studio avd (android virtual device)?
19:02:47 <Pratyush[m]>  * you can build an emulator (Graphene) from sources.
19:03:35 <bizanon[m]> would I need to install android studio on my ubuntu to do that? Pratyush:
19:04:14 <Foxtrek_64[m]> I'll use the profile option then. I guess I'll miss things being on the home screen like with a work profile but I'd rather follow best practice.
19:05:46 <Pratyush[m]> <bizanon[m] "would I need to install android "> nope, but building is painful task to do.
19:07:01 <bizanon[m]> but it says here that you could install studio if you wanted. so it's optional then ?https://grapheneos.org/build#android-studio
19:09:38 <Pratyush[m]> to be honest i did't read the whole instructions, but in my knowledge you won't able to run let say pixel 4a image in emulator and self building x86 images don't not require android studio.
19:10:53 <bizanon[m]> is there any other way to emulate graphene without building it from source?
19:11:50 <Pratyush[m]> i don't have enough knowledge to answer this question rn
19:26:41 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: No, as explained in the screenshot you sent
19:36:54 <rufus_rufus> Recently test drove Grapheneos on older Pixel 2.  Loved everything about it but sim was never recognized (tmobile) anybody have any ideas?
19:40:40 <Thatcher[m]> rufus_rufus try newer pixel and/or new sim. Many of us are on T-mobile, including myself, and it works splendidly
19:48:43 <rufus_rufus> Thatcher[m] My intention is to buy a Pixel4a and go with Grapheneos but concerned about sim issue.  Sim works fine with factory rom and with other custom roms just a no go with Graphene...seemed odd to me.  Thanks for the reply.
20:00:22 <lackshan[m]> rufus_rufus Is your sim issue with a physical sim or an esim?
20:07:08 <rufus_rufus> lackshan physical sim.  tried 2 different sims...neither were recognized.  I even reinstalled graphene to see if it was an install issue..nope.
20:07:41 <lackshan[m]> Is this on a pixel 4a?
20:08:06 <sfafasfa49> Hello,
20:08:07 <sfafasfa49> can someone tell me how i can edit for example the gps.conf or the hosts file? With Root or ADB Root i get every time the message "read only file system" too. And with adb on my p.c I tried also: mount -o rw,remount /system
20:08:08 <sfafasfa49> but i only getting: dev/block/dm-0 is read-only. How i can get write access?
20:08:21 <sfafasfa49> No, i'am talking about pixel 5
20:08:32 <sfafasfa49> with graphene os android 11
20:10:28 <rufus_rufus> lackshan no a pixel 2.  I know its no longer really supported.  I was just testing out roms on this test phone ahead of my impending 4a purchase
20:12:33 <lackshan[m]> rufus_rufus Ah sorry about that, thought you had a pixel 4a.  Support may have been removed for your device (though I don't know for sure)
20:13:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sfafasfa49: sorry, but no one is gonna help you with your problem
20:13:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> root is highly discouraged
20:13:54 <lackshan[m]> sfafasfa49 I think that the default install install instructions don't allow you to have root access
20:13:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> why would you want to edit gpd.conf tho?
20:14:52 <sfafasfa49> I don't know what is was, maybe supl google or something else to change is like my other devices
20:15:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sfafasfa49: please, read the rules
20:15:28 <sfafasfa49> but if we talk about hosts files, i can use an app like adaday to add easy adblock list to it
20:16:24 <sfafasfa49> Root is necessary to make the system like i want it to be
20:16:35 <sfafasfa49> that's the open source spirit
20:16:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> again, read the rules please
20:17:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> either respect them or leave
20:17:57 <sfafasfa49> So the rules are we can't ask for help when we want to customize graphene os like we want it to be?
20:18:30 <sfafasfa49> linux is the greatest os because you can do whatever you want with it and the community is nice and helps you:)
20:18:34 <sfafasfa49> so please be nice :)
20:18:38 <lackshan[m]> sfafasfa49 You should read the FAQ and the rules but the short of it is that there are security implications in rooting your device, hence why it is discouraged
20:19:39 <sfafasfa49> i got not really sentive data, i want more privacy and root is perfect for that, if something i see in the system i don't like
20:19:56 <sfafasfa49> btw graphene OS is working with root perfect
20:20:18 <sfafasfa49> no chance for /e/ or the graphene os fork or lineage
20:20:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS + root != GrapheneOS
20:20:31 <lackshan[m]> The os would work with root but it's security would be compromised
20:20:40 <sfafasfa49> Graphene OS Rooted Edition ;)
20:21:08 <sfafasfa49> I get it with the security, but i'am more into privacy
20:21:20 <sfafasfa49> for security i would use a librem 5
20:21:44 <osund> sfafasfa49: does that even exist?
20:22:19 <sphinx[m]> strcat: JollyRoger strcat TheJollyRoger
20:22:26 <osund> are they released now, I have not followed it at all..
20:23:36 <sfafasfa49> yeah it's out but really an open beta
20:23:41 <sfafasfa49> for security perfect
20:23:45 <sfafasfa49> for normal use
20:23:47 <sfafasfa49> forget it
20:24:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> GrapheneOS is not looking forward to using root.
20:24:21 <lackshan[m]> Not really. The librem lacks a secure boot implementation AFAIK
20:24:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> And finally, GrapheneOS is fully and reliably deGoogled.
20:24:56 <lackshan[m]> That's partly why GOS supports Pixels
20:35:37 <helloworldkk87[m> <sfafasfa49 "for security i would use a libre"> Sound like a really bad idea
20:36:29 <helloworldkk87[m> Just as insecure as linux on desktop
20:36:33 <sphinx[m]> they left, drop it
20:37:01 <helloworldkk87[m> Oh sorry
20:43:15 <nscnt[m]> Feel free to ping me as well. We cover different time zones (besides living different lives), so it varies who is most likely to be available

20:47:51 <sfafasfa> oh
20:59:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> What would cause 'Preferred Network Type' to not show under 'Mobile Network'?
21:06:30 <nscnt[m]> Probably the carrier. See https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/542
21:14:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> @nscnt[m]:  Thanks.  Is LTE preferred over 5G
21:14:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> ?
21:15:18 <flawedworld[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!user> @nscnt[m]:  Thanks.  Is "> See: https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
21:21:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Thanks.  I did read that for like the fourth time but it doesn't directly answer the question although I think I get that 5G should be fine.
21:25:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> here's what i found, you can search more info using the logbot https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210311#c7212599
21:28:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Thanks again.
22:15:53 <yoyoyo> anyone know how to get the browser to reckognize a device
22:16:23 <yoyoyo> device is usb debug enabled with usb preferences for file transfer
22:16:27 <yoyoyo> still no conntection
22:18:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yoyoyo: hello, let me try to help you
22:18:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> what are you trying to do exactly?
22:18:18 <nscnt[m]> You keep joining with a different username and keep asking the same questions in different channels (and not just GrapheneOS channels)
22:18:48 <yoyoyo> no i just started posting friend
22:19:21 <yoyoyo> I'm trying to use the web installer to get graphine os onto my pixel 4a,
22:20:52 <yoyoyo> When i select download release i get an error from my browser that no devices are connected. I dont know what else to do to make the device visible since its usb preferences are set and im getting a response from adb devices
22:21:26 <Pratyush[m]> what platform you are on ? use chromium based browser for installing.
22:21:26 <Pratyush[m]> you need to be in fastboot mode NOT ADB. make sure you have proper driver stuff.
22:21:26 <Pratyush[m]> follow official install guide from graphene website
22:21:37 <yoyoyo> ohhhhh gotcha
22:21:45 <yoyoyo> fastboot
22:22:27 <GhostSplinterSix> Vanadium and Bromite are the two recommended web browsers.
22:22:57 <yoyoyo> edge right now but its working in fastboot
22:25:42 <yoyoyo> thanks all for your help I've been messing with lineage all day getting stuck at the initial boot but this took me like 20 mins, fingers crossed
23:27:26 <SlavWolf> hello, I have a question - I installed GrapheneOS on Pixel 3a, added my Contacts, but none of my apps can see them
23:27:32 <SlavWolf> I checked in Telegram and Signal
23:27:38 <SlavWolf> both have permission to see contacts
23:28:04 <SlavWolf> I tried googling, but no solution
23:28:27 <SlavWolf> I also tried doing factory reset, but nothing changed
23:28:52 <SlavWolf> I remember that in version from 2 months ago everything was working
23:28:57 <SlavWolf> should I reflash?
