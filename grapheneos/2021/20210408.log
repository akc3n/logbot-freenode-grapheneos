00:00:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> lempis[m]: hi, your question is not directly related to grapheneos, and therefore you should move it to off-topic
00:02:00 <lempis[m]> Is that so? I am trying to get to use the ultrawide camera on GrapheneOS
00:02:15 <lempis[m]> But sure, I'll try there too.
00:02:26 <J0sH[m]> Hi all!
00:03:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hi!
00:03:25 <J0sH[m]> Im trying to find out if I need to buy a phone! - I did a stupid think and put the 5g version of graphene os on my pixel 4a (not 5g) now the phone won't turn on or anything :(
00:03:46 <J0sH[m]> *stupid thing
00:04:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, I think I remember you
00:04:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Welp Daniel said that your phone is bricked and you should return it
00:04:33 <akc3n> Ya, I think @Hulk sent you a link to logbot chat from strcat
00:04:34 <J0sH[m]> (moral of the story-don't do new tech things when you are stressed and tired)
00:05:37 <J0sH[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> Welp Daniel said that yo"> ah I thought as much :(
00:06:27 <J0sH[m]> its second hand. don't think I can. Is it possible that a phone technician can repair it or is it as good as an actual brick now?
00:07:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Sorry mate, I'm not knowledgeable enough to answer your question
00:08:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Maybe you can "trade-in" this phone to get a discount for a new one
00:08:46 <J0sH[m]> ok thanks for the reply üëçÔ∏è
00:09:24 <lempis[m]> If you can't get it to boot into recovery, its a paperweight üòï
00:10:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Not at all J0sH! Hopefully everything will turn out good at the end)
00:10:22 <J0sH[m]> <lempis[m] "If you can't get it to boot into"> ok good to know what not to waste my time on!
00:37:56 <fred`> <strcat> some apps are broken and don't support waiting long enough to get a location fix -> using osmand+ (aurorastore) for some time on grapheneOS
00:38:30 <fred`> since these 'april updates' i theres no gps possible
00:39:01 <fred`> also checked with 'Geometric Weather' and this works fine
00:39:25 <strcat[m]> doubt anything is broken with GPS, doubt it had to do with an update
00:39:30 <fred`> also read your explanation, but i have gsm/wlan connect and it still doesnt work
00:39:37 <strcat[m]> people often wrongly associate stuff that occurs for them after reboot with updates
00:39:41 <strcat[m]> simply because it's when they reboot
00:39:58 <strcat[m]> rebooting clears away existing state for GPS, will take longer to get a lock than without rebooting
00:40:08 <strcat[m]> use SatStat or a similar application to make sure it's working
00:40:18 <strcat[m]> if it's an app issue, report it to the app developers
00:40:20 <fred`> i read '10 minutes' without any nets
00:40:22 <strcat[m]> doesn't help to report app issues here
00:40:26 <fred`> is normal
00:40:33 <strcat[m]> outside
00:40:44 <strcat[m]> GPS generally doesn't work inside
00:40:50 <fred`> but here its 15 mins 'with everything' and itdoesnt connect
00:40:59 <strcat[m]> are you inside?
00:41:07 <fred`> i'm on pixel 4a (w/o 5g)
00:41:19 <strcat[m]> 4a (5G) is a different device altogether
00:41:21 <strcat[m]> not just added 5G
00:41:33 <fred`> yes - yep
00:41:40 <fred`> but i didnt mention my hw
00:41:41 <timetravelingman> GPS is fine on my 4a since the April update
00:41:54 <fred`> in my scrollback i read 1/2 ppl with 4a complaining
00:42:59 <fred`> <strcat[m]> are you inside? - yes - but last floor
00:43:38 <fred`> it normaly really sycnd fast
00:43:43 <timetravelingman> What have you done to isolate the issue? Try using GPS in a new profile, try using SatStat and re downloading Osmand, and make sure you're outside to get a good GPS connection
00:44:04 <timetravelingman> If all else fails reset your phone and re install the operating system
00:44:11 <fred`> ehem
00:44:22 <fred`> i rarly use that phone
00:44:38 <fred`> when its a os prob it should be investigated
00:44:54 <timetravelingman> It isn't the OS though
00:44:54 <fred`> i also dont install a lot of software
00:46:18 <fred`> i'm on stable and my phone re-showed the latest update has been installed
00:46:44 <fred`> i already rebooted it ~3 days ago because of the last update
00:47:22 <timetravelingman> Okay, reboot it again
00:47:48 <fred`> already did
00:48:05 <fred`> zwice since last updated msg
00:48:11 <fred`> *twice
00:48:13 <timetravelingman> Okay, wipe the phone and re install
00:48:59 * fred` installs SatStat
00:49:26 <timetravelingman> *Fred's GPS starts to work again*
00:49:32 <timetravelingman> Boom. Problem solved
00:53:29 <fred`> needed to enable 'unsupported' to be able to install satstat
00:53:51 <fred`> satstat works
00:54:48 <fred`> osmand still unable
00:54:51 <fred`> strange
00:55:06 * fred` reinstalls osmand+
00:58:42 <rrrrr123> Hi
00:59:21 <entry1> <rrrrr123 "Hi"> What's up
01:00:54 <rrrrr123> Its really ironic that i had to go thru google capcha on the site of privacy centereed os
01:02:26 <louipc> tor?
01:09:42 <rrrrr123> Which devices are supported by GrapheneOs ? Thanks
01:11:16 <louipc> rrrrr123: please read the FAQ at grapheneos.org
01:53:17 <timetravelingman> Just the iPhone 4
01:55:18 <joeth[m]1> <rrrrr123 "Which devices are supported by G"> pixel 3, 3a, 4, 4a and 5
01:55:36 <joeth[m]1> and 4a 5g
02:07:32 <jj1013[m]> <timetravelingman "Just the iPhone 4"> Just because people are noobs does not mean you should treat them like shit. It kind of annoys me.
02:08:03 <timetravelingman> <jj1013[m] "Just because people are noobs do"> It was just a joke my dude, I was not trying to treat anyone badly
02:13:04 * jj1013[m] glares at timetravelingman.
02:19:39 <tor3nduser[m]> does graphene os support the adaptive battery charging? or is just set to fast charge
02:25:34 <timetravelingman> <tor3nduser[m] "does graphene os support the ada"> Just fast charge
02:28:44 <jj1013[m]> Adaptive Battery Charging is something I have never heard of anywhere.
02:35:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> bertel313 (@b‚Äãertel313) has joined the Telegram Group!
03:07:48 <rhclayto> So on my owner profile, I enable the Quick Settings Developer Tile 'Sensors Off'. When inside of a user profile, this tile is not available, because the developer settings are unavailable in secondary profiles, it would seem. I have tried to make a small app that implements the SensorPrivacyManager (https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensors-off) to make a Sensors Off tile available in secondary profiles, but 'android.hardware.SensorPrivacyMan
03:07:48 <rhclayto> ager' doesn't seem to be available in the SDK in Android Studio. To you Android coders, does this seem doable? This would be something nice to have in GrapheneOS, to toggle on/off all sensors from inside any profile, rather than switching to owner, toggling, then switching back.
03:42:45 <justin[m]2> getting an Error: Undefined on the web installer. installing on a Pixel 5 for Sprint/Tmobile.   Did a manual install and now the LTE doesn't work. Is there an issue with the existing zip that would make it incompatible with a sprint/tmobile version and thus lead to the Error as well?
03:46:37 <randomfox03[m]> you cannot install a custom ROM on a device that is tied to a carrier
03:48:46 <justin[m]2> <randomfox03[m] "you cannot install a custom ROM "> it was purchased unlocked.
03:49:24 <randomfox03[m]> secondhand?
03:50:25 <justin[m]2> <randomfox03[m] "secondhand?"> nope, brand-new, from bestbuy. popped the sim in and booted it for the first time myself.
03:51:23 <randomfox03[m]> well, then refund maybe>
03:51:31 <randomfox03[m]> idk mate
03:51:43 <randomfox03[m]> that error means carrier locked
03:52:00 <sphinx[m]> <randomfox03[m] "that error means carrier locked"> no
03:53:21 <randomfox03[m]> kool
03:53:41 <randomfox03[m]> you solve it
05:22:27 <kayront> hello there, on the market for a new phone and strongly considering a grapheneos-compatible device, but I'm hesitating strongly based on one factor: (lack of) root access. i'm a well-versed sysadmin and so having root comes with the territory. in my mobile/android experience, i've always had root access. yesterday i was considering whether I could live without it, and so far the biggest hurdle would be migrating my data to this new device
05:22:27 <kayront> without root - most of my app data has survived device changes because of oandbackup, which while not perfect (actually it's pretty clumsy, but I don't run google services, and seedvault has to be baked in the OS) certainly has done the job so far.. i don't see how, other than backing up and restoring each and every relevant app (about 20, and not all of them even have backup export/import functionality..) via its presumed backup/export
05:22:28 <kayront> functionality, it would be possible to keep my data .. which is an obvious desirability .. the other problems that concern me in a system without root would be not having AFWall+, though I researched yesterday and it seems there is some sort of AOSP firewall equivalent nowdays .. I'd be happy with it if it can prevent certain apps from communicating unless a VPN is active, but I am not sure if it offers this functionality. the other, and maybe
05:22:33 <kayront> more practical thing, is that a few times over the years I needed to directly edit some app's sqlite database to fix something that broke.. though I guess keeping good seedvault backups would be an option. i really like what grapheneos stands for and i think i'm willing to sacrifice not having root for gaining access to it, but I wonder about the backups thing, and furthermore, even though I've read some of daniel's posts on reddit that came
05:22:39 <kayront> up during my research, I am still not entirely convinced re the no root thing for security: after all, it's not having root access that's a problem, it's root access being misused by someone that shouldn't have it. if someone could share their opinion on why I might be wrong thinking like this in a mobile context, I'd appreciate the data points
05:22:53 <kayront> lol wow, that came up way bigger than I expected
05:24:43 <rny> kayront: no root thing follows closely to the principle of least privilege
05:25:48 <rny> also, if theres no root, apps dont privilege escalate.
05:27:11 <kayront> sure rny, I understand that. but there is a prompt that comes up, it's not like any app can decide to be root and then it happens, right. and yeah, there could be bugs in that barrier, but there could be bugs in everything
05:27:44 <rny> not having root at all eliminates a wide range of attack vectors
05:27:59 <kayront> of course I understand also that any app you decide to grant root access to, breaks the security model. but in my mind that's ok, it's the user's prerogative
05:28:27 <rny> kayront: self-building your own distro is your perogative, you can run a userdebug build to your heart's content
05:28:28 <jpds> kayront: the VPN settings natively implements blocking internet access with no VPN
05:28:31 <rny> :P
05:28:48 <rny> but its just not something that the OS will support officially
05:28:54 <kayront> jpds: they do? is that "new"? (I'm still on android 9)
05:28:56 <rny> too many things can go wrong under those circumstances.
05:29:20 <rny> if you're going to run with root, you're most certainly not using Graphene OS.
05:29:21 <jpds> kayront: Yes, I use it all the time
05:29:54 <kayront> i understand the stance rny and the tone that came up whenever it was discussed (where I could find it) - vaguely hostile :p - gives me assurance that it probably won't change (graphene w/ root)
05:30:31 <kayront> but i'm still curious about some aspects of that decision, and would like to learn more. and then there's the practical side of it - how do I move over my data w/o oandbackup which needs root?
05:30:34 <rny> im not saying this with hostility, i'm explaining to you why there's no root
05:31:10 <rny> but you dont seem to be able to reconcile with the fact that it is all about reducing vulnerability and attack surfaces
05:31:21 <rny> which is definitely a core mission of the project.
05:31:22 <kayront> the only other thing that came to mind is building android9 LOS (what I currently use)  with seedvault, then backup everything, and restore on the new device.. and I have a feeling that's gonna be very, very painful.. assuming seedvault backup/restore works across major OS versions
05:31:36 <kayront> I didn't mean it in your case rny. just in general from the posts I found
05:31:55 <timetravelingman> You can't restore root data to a phone without root
05:32:08 <timetravelingman> Sorry boss
05:32:31 <rny> kayront: yes it should work
05:33:15 <rny> apps should implement appropriate migration strategies to target various android API levels
05:33:52 <rny> evidently, there's bad quality apps out there that dont implement robust migration strategies
05:34:01 <rny> sadly, theres not much the OS can do about it
05:35:14 <kayront> i'm also curious rny, since clearly in our *nix computers everyone has, loves and needs root (occasionally, at least) -- what is the argument/rationale to say "mobile is different" ? because so far in my mobile career, it hasn't been, and that always felt natural/expected
05:36:17 <kayront> oh and another thing, not graphene related, but since everyone is interested in security stuff.. any idea if the modem really stops transmitting when airplane mode is set from android? it should, of course.. but does it?
05:36:54 <kayront> it should become impossible to pinpoint the device's location from the cellular signal, yes? i could not find any real confirmation of this, it's the common sense assumption, but you know what they say about assumptions
05:38:25 <rny> kayront: it depends who you talk to, systems folks will definitely want root for maximum convenience to access privileged operations on the OS, but security folks will almost always tell you that you DO NOT need root for typical consumer desktop usage.
05:38:46 <rny> this conversation should go to #grapheneos-offtopic at this point
05:38:52 <rny> its unrelated to #grapheneos anymore
05:39:33 <kayront> got it
05:39:46 <jpds> kayront: It's explained in https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
05:40:36 <kayront> oh yeah, you're right jpds
05:40:41 <kayront> somehow managed to miss that paragraph yesterday
06:08:25 <strcat[m]> kayront: there is a force VPN toggle already, which is simply implied for the built-in VPN support
06:08:52 <strcat[m]> kayront: you have quite the misunderstanding of how the security model works and I'd suggest learning about that before making walls of text here
06:10:04 <strcat[m]> if you do not understand how having root access available to the high level parts of the system compromises security drastically and rules out having a lot of the core security features then you're missing some fundamental misunderstanding on sandboxing, principle of least privilege, etc.
06:10:10 <strcat[m]> it is NOT an appropriate way to implement anything, anywhere
06:10:38 <strcat[m]> traditional OSes being completely insecure and lacking proper sandboxing, full system security models, application security models, etc. is not a reason to do it elsewhere
06:11:13 <strcat[m]> data from another OS is not portable anyway so what you want to do would simply be broken
06:11:20 <strcat[m]>  * data from another OS/device is not portable anyway so what you want to do would simply be broken
06:11:26 <strcat[m]> the built-in backup support deals with all that
06:12:56 <strcat[m]> it's not simply apps which do not have root access but rather everything above the lowest layers of the system is carefully divided into sandboxes with minimal privileges
06:13:16 <strcat[m]> compromising the higher level OS does not provide root access, especially persistently
06:13:38 <strcat[m]> if the UI layer could give out persistent root access then the OS would be drastically less secure and far easier to deeply compromise + persistently compromise it that way
06:14:23 <strcat[m]> and it simply isn't an appropriate way to do anything, there should always be a proper API made for what you want which has a security model, follows the principle of least privilege, can be revoked, does not break the OS security model
06:14:32 <kayront> strcat[m]: do you also run without root on your laptop/workstations? honest question
06:14:37 <strcat[m]> it's a lazy, insecure shortcut breaking the entire security of the OS for hacks
06:15:00 <strcat[m]> kayront: traditional OSes do not have any kind of meaningful security model
06:15:10 <strcat[m]> it's not relevant
06:15:16 <strcat[m]> they could have that and I could do all my work on them
06:17:23 <kayront> having zones or jails and being unable to affect the host system from them, or having users and having them unable to mess with each others stuff, or having users and having them unable to escalate to root, or having different virtual machines unable to mess with each other seems vaguely meaningful to me
06:17:38 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote above
06:18:37 <kayront> i did, hence my reply. you wrote traditional OSes don't have ANY kind of MEANINGFUL security model, I'm saying.. that does not seem to be the case, as those restrictions/delineations seem pretty meaningful .. do you disagree with that ?
06:18:43 <strcat[m]> if there is a way to give out access that bypasses the security model then there is a way for attackers to gain that access simply by exploiting the highest levels of the UI layer
06:18:54 <strcat[m]> kayront: they are not meaningful for applications
06:19:04 <strcat[m]> kayront: there is no isolation for applications, or proper isolation between users
06:19:19 <strcat[m]> > if there is a way to give out access that bypasses the security model then there is a way for attackers to gain that access simply by exploiting the highest levels of the UI layer
06:19:21 <strcat[m]> and beyond that
06:19:26 <strcat[m]> it is persistent and cannot ever be revoked/undone
06:19:41 <kayront> btw should we do this in the offtopic chan?
06:19:59 <strcat[m]> the attacker has a minor exploit of the UI layer and then they have persistent root access + all your data from every application / user forever
06:20:05 <strcat[m]> that is what that implies
06:20:25 <strcat[m]> (or an exploit of anything granted that access, no matter how temporary it would have been without this)
06:20:43 <strcat[m]> you do not see how that completely destroys the security model?
06:21:00 <strcat[m]> as is, say an attacker exploits some part of the system UI, all they get is temporary control over it
06:21:23 <strcat[m]> and there is a way to inspect the things that could have possibly been changed
06:21:37 <strcat[m]> you can look through enabled accessibility services, device managers, permissions
06:21:40 <strcat[m]> and revoke
06:21:53 <strcat[m]> and there is no way to gain access to another app's data or OS data
06:22:06 <strcat[m]> or another profile's data
06:22:22 <strcat[m]> you're talking about something that cannot even be inspected / checked / revoked
06:22:38 <strcat[m]> if at any point in the past they have ever gained that kind of temporary control over the UI / application layer
06:22:47 <strcat[m]> they would have persistent root access forever and you can't know if they do
06:22:59 <kayront> I see it, of course - just as well as I see hypervisor exploits, container to host exploits, and so on. software isn't perfect and mistakes are made. you're giving an example of an exploit of the system ui, and sure that could happen and probably already has happened, but so could a bug in selinux.. not to say all bugs in all subsystems are equally likely, of course
06:23:00 <strcat[m]> because they have control over everything you see, the system is built to allow that
06:23:15 <strcat[m]> kayront: comparison doesn't make any sense
06:23:23 <strcat[m]> kayront: and completely misses the point
06:23:42 <strcat[m]> kayront: an exploit in SELinux? okay, and in the model you push they have persistent root access, forever, with no way to get rid of it
06:23:47 <strcat[m]> that is how you want the system to be designed
06:23:49 <strcat[m]> that is not how it is designed
06:24:06 <strcat[m]> an exploit of the OS no matter how deep is not permanent access as long as they stop being able to exploit it each boot
06:24:20 <strcat[m]> and there is no way to do that via simply exploiting a UI bug
06:24:32 <strcat[m]> you cannot turn clickjacking type bugs into that
06:24:58 <strcat[m]> kayront: and, as stated above, it simply make no sense to design anything that way
06:24:58 <strcat[m]> kayront: it is a lazy, incorrect shortcut that's not appropriate for anything serious
06:25:19 <strcat[m]> there is a backup/restore API for backup/restore usable by system backup services
06:25:25 <strcat[m]> Seedvault is what's included and can get better
06:25:30 <strcat[m]> and there's the legacy adb backup/restore
06:26:47 <kayront> let's try point by point. i understand what you're saying, though for an unknown exploited exploit, it doesn't seem to matter that everything is reset at reboot if a malicious app can just retrigger the exploit. in that sense it's "permanent", only until the point that the bug is fixed. at that point I agree with you, the immutability has an advantage
06:27:03 <strcat[m]> kayront: it doesn't matter whether it's this channel or the offtopic channel, the issue is not that what you're saying is offtopic, it's that you're bullshitting about topics you clearly haven't even thought about much
06:27:05 <strcat[m]> kayront: okay first of all
06:27:10 <strcat[m]> issues like clickjacking
06:27:11 <kayront> <strcat[m]> that is how you want the system to be designed --> I never said that
06:27:11 <strcat[m]> UI bugs
06:27:12 <strcat[m]> etc.
06:27:14 <strcat[m]> do not result in that
06:27:18 <strcat[m]> the system UI does not have root access
06:27:21 <strcat[m]> and cannot give it out
06:27:34 <strcat[m]> only a few very core system processes (init, vold) have partial root access
06:27:42 <strcat[m]>  * only a few very core system processes (init, vold, etc.) have partial root access
06:27:58 <kayront> <strcat[m]> kayront: it doesn't matter whether it's this channel or the offtopic channel, the issue is not that what you're saying is offtopic, it's that you're bullshitting about topics you clearly haven't even thought about much ---> it's the 4th time or so you insult my intelligence and assume things about me. can we have a friendly exchange of ideas/opinions/points of views without that hostility? because if you are unable to do so, then I
06:27:59 <kayront> am not interested in continuing this exchange
06:28:20 <strcat[m]> the friendly thing to do would be to read existing information
06:28:24 <strcat[m]> and not post misinformation here
06:28:32 <kayront> alright, apparently not
06:29:02 <strcat[m]> please don't accuse me of things I didn't do
06:29:29 <strcat[m]> bullshitting about stuff is not engaging in an honest discussion
06:30:04 <kayront> and there it is again
06:30:24 <kayront> hey man, whatever. as long as you're happy. not sure what you expect or gain from treating people like that, but not my problem, really. have a nice day
09:29:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> kayront: here is the required reading for you https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux
09:30:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Or did he left? It's not visible on the telegram side
09:32:44 <bootup> i, i am new to custom Rom installation and i need assistance to install graphenos on my newly purchased Pixel 4a. Kind regards
09:34:02 <kskdj[m]> <strcat[m] "please don't accuse me of things"> strcat I truly respect the work you do and recently even started donating monthly. But I can't understand what is you interest in participating in this chats where you get sometimes abused and so on. Doesn't this take much time and energy?
09:35:02 <StVM[m]> bootup: hi
09:35:28 <strcat[m]> kskdj: don't want to get stuck on that
09:35:47 <strcat[m]> it's over, talked to them in PM
09:36:36 <s0s[l]> bootup: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
09:37:06 <s0s[l]> Take your time to read the instructions
09:40:31 <bootup> thank you for the link. I am using the web installer and i am stuck in section : unlocking the bootloader. i read the whole page. The boxes are greyed out. I am on the newest Version of Windows, Edge and updated the Android device to the newest Version as well.
09:42:02 <s0s[l]> ah, did you enable OEM unlocking first?
09:43:45 <bootup> yes i enabled oem unlocking first, did an adb backup (adb backup -all) and my phone is in the Bootloader menu atm
09:47:43 <s0s[l]> ok, maybe try another USB port or cable..
09:51:06 <s0s[l]> Also don't forget to install and update the fastboot driver
09:51:23 <s0s[l]> on your windows machine
09:51:57 <bootup> couldd you please give me some assistance there because my windows update did not find any update for fastboot
09:52:32 <bootup> i guess you refer to: On Windows, you may need to install a driver for fastboot now: In Windows Update, click Check for updates. After that there might be a link "View optional updates."
09:54:41 <strcat[m]> if the buttons are grayed out something is wrong with your browser
09:55:23 <strcat[m]> is your OS up-to-date? is Edge up-to-date?
09:55:34 <strcat[m]> it's not the obsolete old Edge before it was based on Chromium right?
09:57:35 <s0s[l]> Well if it's a browser problem try another one, Chrome for instance. Then you' ll know right away
09:57:49 <s0s[l]> also the latest fastboot driver for windows: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
09:58:23 <bootup> I am using Microsoft Edge 44.18362.449.0.
10:04:19 <bootup> i will run the newest edge installer and will relock in a minute
10:04:43 <pkgbuild[m]> Again, the drivers if the button are greyed there is no function to enable for installing
10:06:43 <pkgbuild[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
10:09:25 <bootup> i downloaded the package from https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
10:09:26 <bootup> and https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
10:09:26 <bootup> how i am able to install them?
10:11:00 <bootup> do i need to double click the file fastboot and the file.dll?
10:11:10 <sphinx[m]> bootup: did you successfully updated Edge and the buttons are not greyet out anymore?
10:11:40 <sphinx[m]> greyed
10:11:52 <bootup> installation is pending and i need to restart this browser. I will relock in a minute
10:14:08 <rhymecheat> Hi all, apologies if this has been asked/reported before: Since the RQ2A.210405.005.2021.04.05.20 update I've lost phone signal as it goes between "No service" and "Emergency Calls Only - EE". I've tried the SIM on a different phone (which seems to work) and I've also tried a different SIM on my phone (which doesn't). Anybody seen anything like
10:14:09 <rhymecheat> this before?
10:14:55 <bootup> i am back.

12:18:43 <loko97> hello
12:19:13 <loko97> i have a problem when i open flash all the cmd window closed and nothing happen
12:20:17 <helloworldkk87[m> Use the web installer instead
12:20:37 <loko97> web installer ?where is that
12:21:01 <helloworldkk87[m> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#web-install
12:21:24 <helloworldkk87[m> The normal CLI can be tricky
12:21:26 <loko97> thank you
12:21:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> Oh
12:22:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> The CLI script is supposed to be executed by PowerShell, right?
12:22:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> I extracted adb, fastboot and necessary files into $PATH (or alike) but it still cannot find adb and exitted
12:23:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> (already done flashing, just a report)
12:31:15 <nscnt[m]> loko97: Did you take a look at the official website to get official installation instructions before following another unofficial guide, or did you start with an unofficial guide right away?
12:31:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> Following the official cli guide
12:32:04 <nscnt[m]> Are you loko97 ?
12:32:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> oh sry
12:40:02 <nscnt[m]> @PAN0PT1KON : There is nothing we can do except assume that you didn't follow a step correctly
12:40:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> hmmmmm
12:40:51 <faxing[m]> Make sure adb is in the root of your C: drive if you're doing it on Windows
12:40:53 <faxing[m]> I made that mistake with Lineage OS a long time ago
12:41:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> It's included in the PATH variable and is executable if I type fastboot and press Enterü§î
12:41:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚ÄãAN0PT1KON> very strange
13:00:38 <iccedlemontea[m]> Switched to GrapheneOS as my daily driver recently, and i gotta say its so seamless. Feels exactly like stock android (without the google stuff) and everything 'just works'

15:08:48 <helpyhelp> Any suggestions on why I'd be getting a error : unknown when obtaining the factory images ? This is on a brand new Pixel 4a. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated, thanks !!
15:09:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helpyhelp: hello!
15:09:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> let me try to help you)
15:09:56 <helpyhelp> Hey !!
15:10:02 <helpyhelp> Ok, thank you !!
15:10:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Please follow these and only these instructions https://grapheneos.org/install/web
15:10:52 <helpyhelp> It makes it about 2/3 - 3/4 of getting the image and then I get that error.
15:11:28 <helpyhelp> That's exactly what I'm doing. Direct from the site
15:12:09 <helloworldkk87[m> Are you using the USB cable that shipped with the device? Broken USBs seem to be number one cause of problems
15:12:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helpyhelp: good, which OS are you using, and are you on private browsing?
15:13:06 <helpyhelp> Yes brand new as well. I literally just opened the box and started this, phone and cable are brand new.
15:13:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helloworldkk87[m: hi mate, I can handle this one)
15:13:25 <helloworldkk87[m> Roger that Hulk :)
15:13:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helpyhelp: you should update your phone's OS
15:13:52 <helpyhelp> Phone is updated.
15:14:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Private browsing breaks the web installation
15:14:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You should only use a proper browser and allow all cookies
15:14:51 <helpyhelp> The phone is connected to wifi, its been updated, I just installed chrome, so chrome has no add ons and it's in incognito mode
15:15:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Incognito is bad
15:15:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Go with regular tabs
15:16:32 <helpyhelp> Ok, it's getting to the breaking point again, if it breaks again this time then I'll turn everything off and allow all cookies as well.
15:16:53 <helpyhelp> ok it broke again.
15:17:14 <helpyhelp> Are VPNS a issue ?
15:18:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I would suggest disabling everything that can interfere
15:18:20 <helpyhelp> ok, I'll do all that now. Thanks !!
15:18:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just to check, are you on Windows 10, using Chrome to install an unlocked Pixel 4a?
15:18:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (not 5G)
15:18:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Correct?
15:19:05 <helpyhelp> I'm on Linux¬† Mint 20, Chrome, unlocked 4a yes
15:19:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, well, you know, Linux Mint isn't a supported OS
15:20:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Ok, and your PC has a proper USB-C port?
15:20:21 <helpyhelp> no add ons on chrome, just allowed all cookies and not in incognito mode¬† and now going to turn off proxy and VPN allowing all traffic except for firewall
15:21:30 <helpyhelp> Yes, I have the USB-C from the pixel phone, along with the breefy one that cam with the pinephone, both seem to be good quality
15:21:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Ehmm, that's not what I asked
15:23:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helpyhelp: does the computer, which you are using to install GrapheneOS has a proper USB-C port?
15:24:38 <helpyhelp58> sorry disconnecting everything disconnected me here
15:24:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it happens)
15:25:08 <helpyhelp58> but it looks like we made it !!
15:25:37 <helpyhelp58> What risk do or would I take by using mint and not Ubuntu or Debian ?
15:26:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if you're using the web installer you are not likely to brick your phone
15:26:59 <helpyhelp58> It made it, didn't break but curious should I get a prompt to proceed ?
15:27:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> But, if instead you were using CLI installation the probability of irreversibly bricking skyrockets
15:27:52 <helpyhelp58> Like how I was informed my bootloader was uplocked
15:29:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just follow the instructions word-by-word and you'll be fine)
15:30:57 <helpyhelp58> I see GrapheneOS on the fastboot screen !! I'm so excited !!! Thank you so much for your help and patience !!! I'm going to hang around until I have the phone completely set up. I feel like a little kid, so happy right now !!
15:31:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, fingers crossed)
15:36:00 <helpyhelp58> lol, it flashed google and my heart sank but it has the GrapheneOS splash page
15:37:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yes, this exactly how it should be
15:37:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Don't forget to do the post-installation things
15:38:11 <helpyhelp58> ok, I am reading through that now
15:40:42 <helpyhelp58> should it always start with your device is loading a different OS ?
15:41:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yes
15:41:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> It will only stop doing so if you were to return to stock OS
15:42:41 <helpyhelp58> ok, just checking. locked the OEM, now going to verify install
15:42:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Great! Welcome onboard)
15:43:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> It's recommended to disable developer options
15:44:33 <helpyhelp58> ok, It that as simple as once OEM lock and phone is rebooted ?
15:45:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> No, there's a toggle at the very top of developer options)
15:46:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helpyhelp58: welcome to the community!
15:46:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Here is the official "required" reading listhttps://grapheneos.org/https://attestation.app/
15:47:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And here is the "recommended" reading listhttps://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wikihttps://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/appshttps://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profileshttps://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge
15:47:13 <helpyhelp58> what if I don't have another android phone to verify the install ?
15:47:36 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <helpyhelp58 "what if I don't have another and"> There is online remote attestation service
15:48:32 <helpyhelp58> Is it on the Graphene site ?
15:49:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> helpyhelp58: it's here https://attestation.app/
15:49:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Again, "required" reading
15:51:26 <helpyhelp58> I'm pulling up the links now
15:57:46 <helpyhelp58> I don't get it. I enabled remote verification. I scanned the QR code, now I put in a Alert Email, set config and thats its ?
16:02:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> did you expect something more?)
16:03:54 <helpyhelp> lol, I guess I did, but I see now that I should or will get a email at the set time to verify my device is safe and secure.
16:04:50 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Either wait for an email or login in attestation.app when there is a successful remote attestation
16:10:47 <helpyhelp> I logged back into attestation.app and I see keys, just looking now where to compare them.
16:16:36 <helpyhelp> Is it safe to try and put f-droid on the phone ?
16:16:57 <dnull> helpyhelp: Sure. I have it.
16:17:33 <helpyhelp> Ok, I'm reading now on how to install it on the phone.
16:17:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Why not, try other lightweight and modern clients too like FoxyDroid
16:18:12 <southron[m]> Foxy droid is great
16:20:50 <rotgipfler> Hi, I want to install grapheneos with fedora...the only problem I have is the thing with the tmp storage...when I execute "TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh" it says "waiting for device"
16:21:21 <helpyhelp> Foxy droid over f-droid ?
16:21:39 <rotgipfler> oh sry, "sudo" was missing
16:21:51 <rotgipfler> thx for your help X-P
16:25:47 <helpyhelp> To everyone who just helped me with the install. THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!
16:28:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> No problem)
16:28:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rotgipfler: just use the web install, please
16:29:15 <rosie> After I finish installing GOS on a phone, is it possible to install some apps BEFORE I put the sim card in the phone?
16:29:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yes
16:29:59 <rosie> Perfect!
16:30:18 <rosie> Doing the preps for the install now.
16:30:38 <ananteris[m]> I've noticed after adding in a second user account that my camera no longer works from lockscreen, is there a way around that?
16:32:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ananteris[m]: go to settings
16:33:21 <rosie> Chromium works on Debian, correct?
16:34:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ananteris[m]: Settings -> Security -> Screen lock camera access
16:34:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: yes
16:34:58 <rosie> Awesome!
16:42:50 <rosie> Do I have to be root on the host computer?
16:43:18 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No
16:44:01 <grouxy> I get following error when I try to sign app with platofrm keystore java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: couldn't map .....¬† segment 0: Permission denied, this happens only for apps which uses JNI, anybody knows why?

16:58:52 <rosie> Do I need to connect the phone to wifi to enable OEM unlocking?¬† (No SIM card yet.)
17:00:10 <dnull> Nope
17:02:09 <rosie> "Enable OEM unlocking" is greyed out, and the GOS install instructions say, "This requires Internet access on devices with Google Play Services as part of Factory Reset Protection for anti-theft protection."¬† How do I get around this?
17:03:22 <rosie> This *IS* an unlocked phone, BTW.
17:09:02 <rosie> Is there another way to connect the device to the Internet to enable unlocking, other than wifi or SIM card?¬† Or can I enable it some other way?
17:12:02 <kayront> rosie: at least on a tablet i've had success in the past by connecting a usb ethernet dongle. surprisingly, it worked
17:21:25 <rosie> @kayront¬† Don't have one of those, unfortunately.¬† Trying to connect to wifi now.
18:00:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: I'm back) yes, you need to connect to internet to enable OEM unlocking
18:00:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> dnull: not good( don't spread misinformation
18:04:41 <dnull> And I did that how?
18:04:47 <rosie> I finally got connected to wifi and got the phone booted into bootloader interface, but every time I try to unlock the bootloader, I get a message that it can't find a compatible device.
18:05:52 <adry8314[lp]> Just got a 4a-5G.  Wanted to confirm here, so should I upgrade to android 11 before continuing the instructions?
18:06:05 <rosie> @dnull you said that we don't have to be connected to the internet in order to enable OEM unlocking.¬† In GOS-speak, that's spreading misinformation.
18:06:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: does your PC come with USB-C port?
18:07:01 <dnull> I stand corrected. Was pretty sure I did it without. Apologies.
18:07:12 <rosie> No, it doesn't.
18:07:22 <Guest11619> Hello
18:07:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's fine dnull)
18:07:54 <dnull> I wasn't talking to you.
18:08:07 <rosie> I have been trying several USBA-USBC cables, but no joy.¬† I also tried flipping the USBC connector.
18:08:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: it's highly recommended to use a computer with a usb-C port
18:08:22 <rosie> Yes, but I don't have access to one.
18:08:25 <Guest11619> I'm having some problems with the instalation with a pixel 5 on a windows computer using the web instalation method
18:08:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Or another android phone with usb-C
18:09:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Otherwise there are only few companies that make good enough cables
18:09:22 <rosie> I can install from just another Android phone with regular Android?
18:09:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Guest11619: hello!
18:10:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: yes, if it has USB-C
18:10:20 <rosie> I don't see that in the supported options.¬† I don't have GOS on any other phone.
18:10:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Another Pixel is recommended for that, but a few folks made it with Samsungs
18:10:44 <rosie> \My other phone is a Samsung (i.e. not supported).
18:10:50 <Guest11619> I'm using a usb C to a usb A cable from one plus, I have no computer with usb c port
18:10:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> It just better be a good, recent Samsung
18:11:05 <rosie> Samsugn 8?
18:11:07 <Guest11619> I'm stuck in the fastboot screen
18:11:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: haven't tried it before, but might work)
18:11:59 <rosie> Guest11619¬† You're in the same place I am.¬† You need either a computer with a USB-C port or a REALLY good USBc-USBA cable
18:12:16 <Guest11619> Damn
18:12:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Guest11619: so you are stuck on bootloader unlocking?
18:12:34 <rosie> I'll give the Samsung 8 a whirl.¬† I still need one of the supported browsers?
18:12:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yes, chrome would do
18:13:16 <Guest11619> In the flashing factory image process
18:13:40 <Guest11619> In the Graphene Fastboot screen
18:13:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> are you getting an error, or is it just stuck there?
18:14:07 <Guest11619> Just Stuck
18:14:14 <Guest11619> For like 30 min
18:15:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Guest11619: are you the same Guest that came a few days ago with a similar problem?)
18:15:40 <Guest11619> nope
18:15:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok
18:16:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> The flashing process requires a perfect USB implementation on all sides
18:16:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That is the phone, the computer, and the cable
18:16:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If any of them is not good enough, you get stuck
18:17:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> So, I recommend you to use a different port/cable/computer
18:17:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> It's highly recommended to use the cable that came with your phone
18:18:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And to use a computer or another android phone with a proper USB-C port
18:18:12 <rosie> The Pixel keeps going into Fastboot Mode.¬† That's NOT what I want, correct?
18:18:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: it will reboot a lot
18:18:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That's how the flashing process goes
18:18:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Read the manual
18:19:19 <rosie> No, I mean BEFORE I connect it to the host device.
18:20:05 <rosie> I'm at the "Booting into the bootloader interface" step.
18:21:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: sounds correct to me)
18:22:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Unfortunately, I can't stand by your shoulder and be 100% sure about anything you do
18:23:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so keep us updated rosieüëç
18:23:59 <rosie> Seems to be working from my phone so far.¬† At least the "Unlock bootloader" step recognized the phone this time.
18:24:22 <rosie> It's downloading sunfish right now.
18:24:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Fingers crossedü§û
18:27:37 <rosie> If I had any inkling that I could do this from my Samsung phone, I would have done it weeks ago!¬† I just finally got Debian installed on my desktop (after fighting with Arch for several days).¬† I wanted to switch to Linux anyway, but thought I had to wait for that to do the GOS install.
18:28:17 <floramike[m]> Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I'm getting error messages when I try to take a screenshot, whether I save it or edit and then save it.
18:28:31 <SEXNERD> I need to flash the firmware and os on a pixel 3 that has graphene installed. Are there any warnings I need to know or nest practices aside from the instructions online? Was going to flash firmware first then graphene os
18:28:50 <floramike[m]> I noticed the message references a directory, and the beginning has three / in a row, so maybe that's it?
18:29:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeah, I was in a similar situation when I was trying to install GOS the first time, rosie XD
18:30:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> floramike[m]: need more info to reproduce
18:30:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> SEXNERD: hello!
18:31:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> What exactly are you trying to do?
18:31:19 <rosie> My hubby's phone is literally about to go dark (screen going out).¬† I'm hoping to surprise him later today with his new phone. (He knows about GOS and is onboard, but doesn't know I already got the phone.)
18:31:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Are you trying to switch from stock OS to GrapheneOS or the other way around?
18:32:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> SEXNERD
18:33:11 <floramike[m]> If I try to screenshot what I'm currently looking at, it captures it, loads Gallery, and offers me the opportunity to edit the image before saving. Whether I edit first or not, I get a long error message that quickly disappears. I'm on the device now so it's tricky to document. I'll try a bit at a time
18:33:38 <rosie> Flashing the new device now.¬† What should I see to let me know that it's finished?
18:33:55 <SEXNERD> Hulk: I have a pixel 3 with graphene and want to reflash the phone's firmware and reinstall graphene for security purposes
18:34:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> floramike[m]: it's a known bug, Gallery is not able to edit pictures
18:34:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: just keep an eye on the web installer)
18:35:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> SEXNERD: What does your Auditor say?
18:35:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If you think your phone is compromised the first thing to do is to check the Auditor
18:36:46 <rosie> Host sayd "Restarting device. . ."¬† and Pixel is at fastbootd GrapheneOS fastboot, with a message that says Reboot system now.¬† do I need to restart the phone now, or will it do that by itself?
18:37:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: it should do everything by itslef
18:38:16 <rosie> So click on "Lock bootloader" on the host?
18:38:23 <SEXNERD> Hulk: would like to but I don't have another pixel with grapheme to check with Auditor. Its definitely been compromised.
18:38:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: from the manual "Wait for the flashing process to complete. It will automatically handle flashing the firmware, rebooting into the bootloader interface, flashing the core OS, rebooting into the userspace fastboot mode, flashing the rest of the OS and finally rebooting back into the bootloader interface. Avoid interacting with the device until the flashing script is finished and the device is back at the bootloader interfa
18:38:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> SEXNERD: just do remote attestation then
18:38:57 <rosie> Right, just trying to make sure it's actually finished.
18:39:04 <floramike[m]> " Image editing failed. Failed to load sampled bitmap: file:///storage/emulated/0/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_20210408-142155.png

18:40:33 <rosie> Host device seems to have lost connection.¬† "Lock bootloader" gives me the "can't find compatible device" message.
18:40:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> floramike[m]: just don't use the Stock Gallery app to edit pictures. It's a known bug
18:40:35 <floramike[m]> If Gallery can't edit or save screenshots, any suggestions on what else I could use?  I'm still pretty new to Android
18:41:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> floramike[m]: Gallery can save screenshots, it just can't edit them
18:41:54 <SEXNERD> Hulk: How do I go about doing remote attestation? Sorry its my first time
18:42:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just when you do a screenshot, don't press anything
18:42:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> SEXNERD: https://attestation.app/
18:42:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: did the flashing step ended successfully?
18:42:56 <floramike[m]> Okay. Any recommendations for editing them?
18:43:00 <rosie> It seems to have.
18:43:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if so, yes, proceed to locking
18:44:01 <rosie> When I click on "Lock bootloader" I get "no compatible device fount".
18:44:07 <rosie> *found
18:44:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Try disconnecting and reconnecting
18:45:03 <rosie> On the Pixel there's a menu with "Reboot system now", "Enter recovey", "Reboot to bootloader" "Power off"
18:45:55 <rosie> disconnected and reconnected, still "no compatible device".
18:46:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Reboot to bootloader
18:47:34 <rosie> "Error:¬† Bootloader replied with FAIL: Fastboot: invalid command update-super:super:wipe:
18:48:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is that the phone or the browser?
18:48:13 <rosie> The host (browser)
18:48:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Try again, if you get the same error you should reflash again
18:48:43 <rosie> Pixel is back at the Fastboot Mode screen
18:49:02 <rosie> Try what again (from which step)?
18:49:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Obtaining factory images
18:49:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh no
18:50:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I meant locking the bootloader
18:50:30 <rosie> Ok, locking the bootloader seems to have worked that time.¬† Now I reboot, correct?
18:51:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yea, just follow the instructions
18:51:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Don't forget about post-installation steps
18:52:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And to verify your GrapheneOS using Auditor
18:52:45 <rosie> "Cant find valid operating system.¬† The device will not start."
18:53:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Welp, let's restart then :P
18:54:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Can you boot back to bootloader?
18:55:06 <rosie> The only option it's giving me is "Press power button to power off"
18:55:25 <rosie> Should I try the restart with volume button?
18:55:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeah, you need to use the button combination
18:56:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And then you need to start from Unlocking the Bootloader again
18:56:33 <rosie> Can't seem to even get it to power off.
18:57:50 <SEXNERD> Hulk: So if Auditor finds a compromise it will tell me where it is and then I will need to flash firmware and os? Whatever was done isn't being cleared by reinstalling graphene so it must be at the firmware/hardware level.
18:58:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> SEXNERD: not exactly, but if anything is wrong, Auditor would tell you that "something's wrong"
18:59:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> BTW, why do you think your phone was compromised?
18:59:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Antonio has joined the Telegram Group!
19:00:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: did it boot to bootloader?
19:01:14 <rosie> Finally got it to reboot to bootloade.¬† Trying again.
19:01:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Good!
19:01:55 <rosie> Trying my darndest not to touch anything.
19:02:04 <nscnt[m]> SEXNERD: It's hard for a compromise to be persistent due to verified boot. A reboot of the device should be enough.
19:02:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Remember that as soon as you boot into the bootloader, your phone is not bricked
19:02:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> as soon as you can boot into bootloader*
19:03:23 <rosie> CRAP!¬† Battery died on my host phone!¬† No warning!!
19:03:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Damn
19:03:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Did it finish the unlocking process?
19:04:33 <rosie> Pixel seems to be just waiting in unlocked bootloader mode, so hopefully it will wait until the host phone can be reconnected.
19:04:58 <rosie> Yes, it had already unlocked and it was in the flashing process.
19:05:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Not too bad then afaik)
19:05:48 <rosie> Wish there were a way to keep the host phone plugged in while it flashes the Pixel.
19:06:06 <rosie> Recharge is already at 60%.
19:06:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rosie: while you are waiting for the host to charge
19:06:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Here is the official "required" reading listhttps://grapheneos.org/https://attestation.app/
19:06:17 <nscnt[m]> SEXNERD: Remote attestation will notify you when there haven't been a successful verification after the set time. That doesn't mean that your device is compromised. Not having internet for the period will trigger it as well. Auditor also doesn't tell you where a compromise is
19:06:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And here is the "recommended" reading listhttps://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wikihttps://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/appshttps://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profileshttps://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge
19:06:57 <nscnt[m]> SEXNERD: https://attestation.app/about
19:07:47 <nscnt[m]> Sounds like a troll, tbh @Hulk
19:07:51 <rosie> I read through that a few weeks ago.¬† I have two phones to put GOS on, so I plan to let them attest each other.
19:08:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> wait a sec rosie
19:08:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> So you have access to 2 pixel phones?
19:09:22 <rosie> Yes.¬† Hopefully they'll both have GOS within the next hour or so.
19:09:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Then why are you using Samsung for flashing?
19:09:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You could have used the other pixel
19:10:25 <rosie> Based on the Install instructions, I thought a phone had to have GrapheneOS in order to be the host.
19:11:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> No no no
19:11:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Google Android on GrapheneOS-supported devices
19:11:36 <SEXNERD> nscnt[m]: I see, thanks for the answer. My questions are legit, not sure what I'd gain from 'trolling'.
19:11:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Which means a Stock OS Pixel
19:11:48 <rosie> Guess I misunderstood it.¬† Now I know!
19:12:45 <nscnt[m]> SEXNERD: I wasn't referring to you
19:13:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so yeah, Rosie, can you use it right now?
19:13:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the other pixel?
19:14:25 <rosie> I could.¬† My Samsung battery is back to 68% now, though, so I just rebooted it.
19:15:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's recommended to use a Pixel (2/3/4/5) as a host
19:15:27 <SEXNERD> nscnt[m] verified boot only verifies the image right? If it was hardware/firmware/bios level it would persist.
19:15:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> As it was already tested and verified that those can do the flashing job properly
19:16:10 <nscnt[m]> SEXNERD: No
19:18:37 <rosie> I'll give it a shot.¬† Gotta do the song and dance to connect the second Pixel to the wifi first, but I have to do that anyway.
19:19:03 <rosie> In the mean time, the Samsung is back up and trying to connect to the first Pixel.
19:19:11 <nscnt[m]> SEXNERD: https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot
19:19:36 <Railroaded> I just bought an Unlocked, Open Box Pixel 5 on ebay. When I went to OEM Unlocking, it was grayed out. Is that changeable?
19:20:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Railroaded: hi! Connect the Pixel to the internet
19:20:11 <rosie> @Railroaded Do you have it connected to the Internet (at least wifi)?
19:20:26 <Railroaded> It is connected to wi-fi.
19:20:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If it's still greyed out that's bad(
19:21:31 <SEXNERD> Not to sound all paranoid but Snowden's disclosures show the more advanced NSA compromises are mostly hardware based which evade detection and survives reinstalls, and that was almost 10 years ago
19:21:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nscnt[m]: do you remember the adb commands to check the unlockability?
19:22:03 <Railroaded> I factory reset it a couple of times and reconnected to the Internet, but OEM unlocking is still grayed out.
19:22:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Railroaded: so the phone was used before right?
19:23:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And you didn't get it from the official Google store
19:23:28 <SEXNERD> Railroaded: mine did the same until I updated it to the latest Android then OEM unlocking was available. You might have a Verizon model though
19:23:31 <Railroaded> !Hulk: It was supposed to be New--Open Box.
19:24:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Might be easier to return it, get the money, and buy from the Google store
19:24:34 <Railroaded> Okay. Thank you.
19:26:15 <skwisgaar[m]> Railroaded: if you determine it‚Äôs a carrier model (and not verizon), you might be able to get it unlocked, but it‚Äôs always safer/easier to get the phone straight from google.
19:27:06 <rosie> Flashing seems to be progressing well (with Samsung--still setting up the 2nd Pixel on wifi)
19:27:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sounds good rosieüëç
19:27:46 <rosie> @Railroaded¬† If you're in the U.S, Best Buy has unlocked Pixel 4a for $349.
19:33:59 <rosie> We have ignition!!¬† Successful install!¬† Just in time, too--the Samsung battery died AGAIN, and it is WARM!
19:34:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeeeiiiii!
19:35:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> So bootloader locking went successful?
19:36:03 <rosie> yes, it did!
19:36:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Good! Now don't forget to do all the post-installation things
19:36:38 <rosie> I have a fully functional GraphenOS phone.¬† Now to do the other one.
19:36:56 <rosie> The install wouldn't have changed the MAC address, would it have?
19:37:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That's one of the GrapheneOS features
19:37:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> It randomizes MAC address every single time
19:38:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You should really disable OEM unlocking
19:38:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And disable developer options
19:38:30 <rosie> CRAP!!¬† I have my router set up with MAC address access control.¬† Any way around it?
19:38:54 <skwisgaar[m]> You can change your mac preference in wifi settings
19:39:13 <skwisgaar[m]> It just defaults to randomizing the mac on each connection
19:39:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Default enabled per-connection MAC randomization¬†as an improvement over Android's default per-network MAC randomization reusing the same MAC address until the DHCP lease with that network expires (can still use the standard implementation or fully disable it)
19:40:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy-associated
19:42:36 <rosie> I'm reading it, but it's not making much sense.¬† Maybe I need a break.
19:45:51 <rosie> How do you disable developer options after disabling OEM unlocking?
19:46:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> There's a toggle at the very top
19:47:31 <rosie> Oh, I see it now.¬† Thanks!
19:48:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Great!
19:48:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can now install the GrapheneOS on your second Pixel
19:49:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> And then use them to do the "Verifying installation" step
19:50:40 <rosie> Yes, I'm about to, but first I have to figure out how to turn off MAC randomization, at least for my home wifi.
19:51:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Good luck, have fun, and welcome aboard the GrapheneOS ship P.-)
19:51:56 <rosie> Ah, found it!
19:52:47 <rosie> Gott charge the first Pixel a bit first, as well.
19:56:43 <rosie> I guess you can add Samsung with Google Chrome browser as a successful host device for installing GOS.
19:57:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That was Samsung Galaxy S8 in particular, right?)
19:58:00 <rosie> Yes.
19:58:26 <rosie> And it looks as though it wasn't the battery going dead but the phone getting too warm.¬† I even had the case off.
19:58:41 <rosie> And all other apps turned off.
20:07:19 <Eddy[m]> is graphene available on that weird xiaomi phone
20:08:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Eddy[m]: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
20:09:08 <Eddy[m]> so no
20:09:11 <Eddy[m]> i was just wondering
20:09:17 <Eddy[m]> a simple no wouldve sufficed
20:09:40 <Eddy[m]> because i saw the phone being supported by another security project similar to graphene
20:09:44 <Eddy[m]> so i was like hmmm
20:10:40 <rosie> No, GrapheneOS supports ONLY the phones listed on that page.
20:11:10 <fomijafi[m]> There are very specific reasons for the device choices which don't need to be rehashed over and over again
20:11:40 <rosie> That's a function of the Phone makers, not GrapheneOS.
20:11:42 <fomijafi[m]> Its important to keep directing folks to the very rich documentation for the project
20:12:31 <Eddy[m]> the website is designed really well
20:12:35 <Eddy[m]> like its not soy type
20:12:40 <Eddy[m]> its minimalist and has little to na js

20:14:22 <rosie> Is there a trick to getting the phone to boot into the bootloader interface?¬† I had trouble with this with the first Pixel, too.¬† It seems to take multiple tries to get it right.
20:18:34 <rosie> I keep getting that Android robot on his back with the "hood" up and "No command".¬† In fact, at first that's what I thought I was SUPPOSED to see at the bootloader interface.
20:18:57 <rosie> Then I have to wait for the darn phone to reboot itself so I can try again.
20:19:16 <PeterEaston> rosie: You're entering recovery. When you see fastboot with the option to power off, start, or go to recovery or rescue that's bootloader.
20:20:00 <PeterEaston> What I want you to do is switch off your phone (press and hold POWER key), then press and hold VOLUME DOWN, then press and hold POWER until you see a black screen with some white and some red text.
20:20:05 <rosie> Right.¬† I finally got it with the first phone, but it took multiple tries to get there, and now it's taking multiple tries to get it with the second phone.
20:20:29 <rosie> So "volume up" is what screws it up?
20:20:33 <PeterEaston> Once you see it, don't enter recovery or rescue, that isn't what we need/want to do the installation.
20:20:54 <PeterEaston> Yeah, as soon as you see that black screen, you need to let go of the buttons and not touch anything else.
20:21:11 <rosie> Right.¬† you probably missed it, but I already got GOS on one phone, and now I'm doing the second one.
20:21:20 <PeterEaston> Great. Carry on!
20:23:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hi Peter)
20:23:48 <rosie> Yay!¬† "Volume down" (instead of just a random spot on the volume button) did the trick!
20:24:35 <rosie> WHEEEEE!!!!!¬† this is fun!
20:29:23 <rosie> Halfway through downloading the factory images for the 2nd phone and it quit, "Error: undefined".¬† Any ideas?'
20:31:41 <rosie> Restarted download.
20:31:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you're not using private tab are you?
20:32:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> cause it should be a regular tab
20:32:34 <rosie> No.¬† Just straight Vanadium (unless it defaults to private tab)
20:39:10 <rosie> How can I make the host phone (Pixel with GOS) stop going to sleep??
20:42:18 <rosie> Nvm.¬† Finally found it.
20:48:29 <hopeimunique> This feels like a really basic question but I'm wondering if I can get some advice. I installed Graphene the other day and I'm trying to up multiple user accounts on the phone for different parts of my life (personal, work, etc.) I didn't find a way to share apps between users so I copied the fdroid apk from my computer to the second account I set
20:48:30 <hopeimunique> up on my phone but I can't get it to install. When I select the .apk file from the file manager it opens it in the package installer and after the installer runs it displays a message telling me "app not installed." Does anyone here have a suggestion for what I could try? I feel like I'm overlooking or missing something basic but don't know what.
20:50:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hopeimunique: hi!
20:50:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> fdroid apk from the fdroid's official website is outdated
20:51:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> android does not allow installing old versions of the apps across different profiles
20:51:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should either get the latest version of fdroid or use aurora store
20:52:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> (or you can use something like foxydroid and other alternatives)
20:56:58 <LarissaCamGirl> hi boyz
20:57:24 <LarissaCamGirl> im just a horni cam girl
20:57:54 <rosie> We have ignition on engine # 2!!
20:59:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> good job rosieüëç
21:12:20 <hopeimunique> thanks. I'm wondering where I would get an up to date fdroid apk if not from there official website? especially if (AFAIK) I need fdroid to install aurora store
21:13:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can get aurora store from their official website :P
21:13:11 <rosie> Thanks for all of the help, y'all, especially @!Hulk and @PeterEaston .¬† Hopefully I'm good now, but if I run into any other difficulty, I know where to to.
21:13:11 <hopeimunique> ah thanks
21:14:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no problem)
21:30:34 <morpheus6[m]>  Any thoughts on using a single profile dedicated to all questionable apps like whatsapp etc. vs a dedicated profile for each one?
21:31:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hi, morpheus6
21:31:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> let me try to explain what was told many times already (if you read the logs)
21:33:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> actually no, TheJollyRoger did a great job explaining this
21:33:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> here, take a look
21:33:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210228#c7065548
21:42:37 <morpheus6[m]> Thanks, yeah logs have a problems loading for me in the app, appreciate the link
22:35:05 <sjsndnjdejd> <hopeimunique "thanks. I'm wondering where I wo"> foxy droid ftw
22:35:16 <sjsndnjdejd> f-droid is shit
22:37:38 <jj1013[m]> Dunno. I am still a legacy client fan.
22:39:44 <sjsndnjdejd> foxy droid has the style of the classic fdroid client
22:40:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> The discussion has become off-topic
22:42:22 <adry8314[lp]> Is it still possible to flash a carrier locked Pixel phone?
22:43:08 <akc3n[m]> No
22:43:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> adry8314[lp]: if it is Verizon -> no.
22:43:53 <adry8314[lp]> akc3n: Thanks
22:44:04 <akc3n[m]> adry8314: Carrier variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it
22:44:19 <akc3n[m]> adry8314: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#prerequisites
22:45:06 <adry8314[lp]> !Hulk: It‚Äôs XFINITY Mobile which uses Verizon
22:45:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just return it then :P
22:46:06 <adry8314[lp]> They‚Äôre giving me 30 days until they‚Äôll unlock the phone.
22:47:14 <adry8314[lp]> So even if they unlock the phone after the 30 days it still won‚Äôt work?
22:48:04 <akc3n[m]> <adry8314[lp] "They‚Äôre giving me 30 days until "> Why 30 days...? Why not now?
23:02:10 <zrtjjtaher[m]> I denied the network permission to the Signal app and I am still receiving Signal messages.
23:02:10 <zrtjjtaher[m]> What am I missing??
23:10:28 <sjsndnjdejd> Did you restart signal?
23:12:34 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Should I have after removing the network permission?
23:12:34 <zrtjjtaher[m]> I mean, when I remove the "files and media" permission to the VLC app, it stops singing immediately
23:13:10 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Does the network permission requires a restart of the app???
23:14:47 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> you can try it instead of asking
23:15:08 <gismwdu> Hi, I will be flashing my Pixel 4a 5g with GrapheneOS, and I was wondering if it mattered which USB-C port of my Dell XPS 13 I use for the flashing process. The two ports on the left output 15 Watts while the on the right only supplies 7.5 Watts. The manual of the Pixel states that "The AC adapter must be certified with a Limited Power Source
23:15:09 <gismwdu> output : 5 Volts DC, maximum 3 Amp; 9 Volts DC, maximum 2 Amp; or both".
23:15:09 <gismwdu> That would imply that I could use either port, as 5 Volts DC and 3 Amps should result in 15 Watts, right? Is there any reason to use the higher powered ports over the lower powered port or vice versa?
23:15:10 <gismwdu> Thanks!
23:15:43 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <dhsjwbbsjxndbs "you can try it instead of asking"> problem is that I don't have another phone to try sending me messages right now.
23:16:28 <akc3n[m]> zrtjjtaher: hi, sorry to hear you're having difficulties with the signal app. As per rule 2.a. https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt

23:17:56 <zrtjjtaher[m]> I asked here because the problem looked more about the network permission than the signal app. Actually, I had the same problem with the Linphone app: Cutting its network access but being able to receive calls.
23:19:14 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> did you grant call permission to signal
23:22:21 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <dhsjwbbsjxndbs "did you grant call permission to"> OK, I:
23:24:27 <zrtjjtaher[m]> As I said, today, I was able to receive a call on the Linphone app, even if it did not have the network permission.
23:24:27 <zrtjjtaher[m]> If I remove the "network" permission from the element app though, element shows me:"connectivity to the server has been lost"
23:24:31 <kan12> hey, I just want to say a big thank you to the grapheneOS team for providing the web installer, it's super useful. Running it on a 4xl now and it's going very well
23:25:27 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <dhsjwbbsjxndbs "send a msg, without internet acc"> This is also what I thought. This is not what I observe, though!
23:25:41 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Is anybody able to reproduce?
23:30:23 <skwisgaar[m]> zrtjjtaher: when I deny signal network the app doesn‚Äôt even launch
23:30:42 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Wow, that's interesting!!
23:31:49 <zrtjjtaher[m]> I am using another user profile than the owner. Are you too? Dunno if this can have an influence, though!
23:33:03 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "zrtjjtaher: when I deny signal n"> This means that you closed Signal by swiping it up and then clicked on it to launch it? And and that moment, Signal refused to start?
23:34:31 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Oh, and I have an "always-on" VPN, which "block connections without VPN". I don't know neither if this is important
23:36:10 <skwisgaar[m]> zrtjjtaher: I am using a secondary user. When network is denied, signal will not run and no messages come through.
23:36:42 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <zrtjjtaher[m] "Oh, and I have an "always-on" VP"> Disabling my VPN and doing the 4 steps test here above gives the same results
23:37:54 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "zrtjjtaher: I am using a seconda"> That's really interesting!! I wonder how an app is able to use the network on MY phone when I explicitly deny its permission!!
23:38:22 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Thanks for testing, skwisgaar  !!
23:39:34 <skwisgaar[m]> Sure! Can‚Äôt really help you out much, I don‚Äôt know why that would happen and I don‚Äôt think any other user has ever encountered this issue either.
23:40:06 <zrtjjtaher[m]> This is not reassuring! :-D
23:42:04 <zrtjjtaher[m]> Just for the record, still no permission "allowed" (so no "network" permission allowed) and my phone is able to receive a message sent to "note to self" from my PC.
23:42:54 <zrtjjtaher[m]> So the app (here: Signal) is able to transmit and receive.
23:43:51 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <zrtjjtaher[m] "Just for the record, still no pe"> This last test was done with the VPN disabled
23:45:25 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: what you're saying isn't accurate
23:45:31 <strcat[m]> you do not have to restart apps for Network permission toggle to work
23:45:56 <strcat[m]> it works immediately and disallows both direct (network sockets) and indirect (IPC requiring INTERNET permission) network access
23:46:05 <strcat[m]> it disallows making network sockets at all including for localhost
23:47:04 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: doesn't sound like you're using GrapheneOS
23:47:27 <strcat[m]> if you're using a fork/derivative of the OS you need to ask them for support
23:49:23 <zrtjjtaher[m]> I am using GrapheneOS and I was really puzzled when I saw this
23:49:39 <strcat[m]> doesn't appear that you're using GrapheneOS since that's not how it works
23:49:48 <strcat[m]> a port of the feature elsewhere may not work the same way
23:49:58 <zrtjjtaher[m]> As stated earlier: I get communications with Signal and Linphone but Element behaves correctly
23:50:11 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "doesn't appear that you're using"> I know!!!
23:50:16 <strcat[m]> it's not up to the app 'behaving correctly'
23:50:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π (@d‚Äãeadlypayload) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:50:41 <strcat[m]> well, your messages do not seem to be accurate
23:50:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãeadlypayload> hey anyone know how to get adb over network working on grapheneOS
23:51:12 <strcat[m]> it's a developer feature available via adb but is likely going to be dropped from production releases of GrapheneOS
23:51:49 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not up to the app 'behaving"> You know what I mean: I am able to get/send messages with Signal and to receive phone calls with Linphone even if those apps do not have the network permission. That is the correct way of stating it.
23:52:30 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a developer feature availab"> I don't know which feature you are talking about. I do not have adb connected.
23:52:30 <strcat[m]> really doesn't sound like you're using GrapheneOS
23:52:33 <rny> zrtjjtaher[m]: sms messages in signal?
23:52:41 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: was not in response to you
23:53:09 <strcat[m]> if you made Signal the SMS app then yeah it can still send SMS without Network that's a separate permission
23:53:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãeadlypayload> Someone message me on telegram @developerneo , need a grapheneOS expert. i pay btc for tips and hep.
23:53:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <d‚Äãeadlypayload> help*
23:53:19 <strcat[m]> Network is about internet access not SMS
23:53:25 <danielsmith[m]> hey all, i'm having this bug where the display doesn't automatically sleep on the latest version of GrapheneOS. anyone else experienced this?
23:53:40 <strcat[m]> danielsmith: check your configuration including in Owner account
23:53:42 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "really doesn't sound like you're"> Daniel, please, of course I am using GOS! Installed it from the official website 1 or 2 months ago when I got my Pixel 4a!! I have the GOS logo when rebooting!!
23:53:47 <rny> also, if you made linphone your actual phone app, then you might be receiving phone calls as oppose to calls that use network sockets LOL
23:53:54 <rosie> Auditor is included with GraphenOS, correct?¬† If so, where do I find it?
23:53:55 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: please clarify if you mean SMS
23:54:00 <strcat[m]> SMS is not the Network permission
23:54:02 <danielsmith[m]> <strcat[m] "danielsmith: check your configur"> ok
23:54:08 <strcat[m]> rny: it's included with GrapheneOS as a user-facing app
23:54:13 <strcat[m]> rosie:
23:54:22 <strcat[m]>  * it's included with GrapheneOS as a user-facing app
23:54:46 <strcat[m]> zrtjjtaher: Network does not disable SMS if you've made an app into an SMS handling app
23:54:51 <strcat[m]> it's not supposed to, separate things
23:54:54 <rosie> Ahh, now I found it.
23:55:02 <strcat[m]> same applies to a dialer app that you've made into the dialer
23:55:03 <rny> strcat[m]: huh? linphone isnt included.
23:55:09 <strcat[m]> that's not the Network permission
23:55:18 <strcat[m]> rny: talking about Auditor
23:55:23 <strcat[m]> rny: meant to ping rosie not you
23:55:35 <strcat[m]> people are mixing up the threads
23:55:40 <rosie> Took me a while to figure out how to access the apps that aren't on the home screen.
23:55:53 <strcat[m]> rosie: you set up the home screen yourself
23:56:03 <strcat[m]> with the apps and widgets you want, where you want them
23:56:05 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <strcat[m] "zrtjjtaher: please clarify if yo"> I am NOT talking about SMS. I do not use Signal for SMS. I am using the app that comes with GOS for SMS. Moreover, I was able to get a call with Linphone.
23:56:28 <rosie> Yes, but there are a few apps that are already on the homescreen when GrapheneOS is first installed.¬† I couldn'
23:56:30 <strcat[m]> as I said above Network does not cover permissions / setups like Dialer and SMS
23:56:57 <rosie> I couldn't figure out how to get to the rest of the apps at first.¬† New phone issue.
23:57:25 <rny> zrtjjtaher[m]: your claim about signal sounds like a load of shit to me, if you strip network permission the app doesnt even laucnh

23:58:41 <rny> zrtjjtaher[m]: then you're probably not using grapheneos
23:59:07 <strcat[m]> or have heavily broken the OS / UI messing with adb, etc
23:59:19 <strcat[m]> such as breaking the PermissionController app so it can't toggle perms
23:59:40 <strcat[m]> did you remove permissions from system apps including PermissionController such as the 'usage stats' perm?
23:59:54 <strcat[m]> don't disable system apps or remove those things from them
23:59:55 <zrtjjtaher[m]> <rny "zrtjjtaher: then you're probably"> When installing from the GOS website? When having the GOS logo when rebooting for 1 or 2 months? What can I tell you??
