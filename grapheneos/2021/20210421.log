02:45:35 <faxing[m]> Weird
02:45:46 <faxing[m]> and the only time it clears up is after you hit save?
02:48:58 <kracklepop[m]> Well, the preview never clears up, but the exported screenshot is fine
02:51:26 <Valentine11> Hello. Does anyone know how long the flashing process is for the webusb installer? I'm concerned it may be stuck.
02:51:54 <faxing[m]> <Valentine11 "Hello. Does anyone know how long"> How long have you been waiting?
02:52:57 <Valentine11> About 5 -7 minutes. It just says "restarting device...", and my phone is showing the fastbootd screen. Is it safe to restart it manually through this interface
03:07:22 <tb14[m]> First time running graphene, coming from lineage. Picked up a pixel 4a 5g for this.  Only issue I'm having so far is with Zello.  My audio goes out but I do not receive anything inbound from any channel including the echo test
04:29:38 <Ed[m]2> Anyone else here use self hosted matrix and has found it to be really slow when it comes to joining servers and such
04:36:41 <valentine97> Hello, I was asking earlier about the webusb installer. Somewhere along the way I accidentally hit the power button and I think I screwed up the installation process. I started reading around, and looking through the logs here, and tried starting fresh with adb. But adb doesn't detect my device and I'm getting warning that I could potentially brick
04:36:42 <valentine97> my phone if I do anything other than resolve this.
04:38:14 <valentine97> The phone isn't showing up in the device manager, either. Any advice?
04:42:34 <Ed[m]2> <valentine97 "The phone isn't showing up in th"> Have you tried installing the CLI way with the recommended software instead of adb?
04:42:51 <Ed[m]2> <valentine97 "The phone isn't showing up in th"> Its really hard to brick a phone so don't worry
04:45:20 <valentine97> You say that, but I've had a string of hundreds of dollars worth of bad luck lately.:P  However no, I did not. I was using the webusb when it wouldn't restart past the fastbootd screen. Then I hit the button by mistake and got a failed message, something like: "invalid command super:super:wipe".
04:45:36 <valentine97> Then I went to try the adb version and I'm stuck here.
04:46:52 <Ed[m]2> <valentine97 "You say that, but I've had a str"> Well I don't really have any experience with the web installer, just the CLI. Best advice I can give is only use the official instructions
04:47:00 <Ed[m]2> <Ed[m]2 "Well I don't really have any exp"> And continue trying
04:49:12 <valentine97> Alright. I'm in the recovery screen, the warning I'm concerned about states: "Previous installation has failed. Your device may fail to boot if you reboot or power off now." Is rebooting to bootloader the best course of action to try again with the command line?
04:49:44 <valentine97> If that's the case I'll just return the guide and try that method.
04:53:42 <Ed[m]2> Sounds risky
04:53:43 <Ed[m]2> Can't help you here
04:53:49 <Ed[m]2> I'd wait for someone like jollyroger to give advice
04:54:06 <valentine97> Right, that's what I was concerned with. Thank you.
04:54:43 <Ed[m]2> Also have you tried looking up your errors?
04:54:51 <Ed[m]2> I'm sure someone has had your problem before
04:55:21 <valentine97> Yes, it was one person here. He was recommended to try sideloading, which is what I tried, up until adb didn't want to play with my Pixel.
06:02:07 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: Try the WebUSB-based Installation from the beginning again
06:02:32 <valentine97> Even with the recovery screen up?
06:02:36 <nscnt[m]> Nvm was an hour ago and already legt :^)
06:02:43 <nscnt[m]> Ah, hello
06:03:02 <valentine97> I've had it set up here while playing games on my desktop. Hello. :)
06:03:29 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: Reboot into the bootloader menu again as written in the guide
06:03:40 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: Are you on Windows?
06:03:45 <valentine97> Yes.
06:04:41 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: Just start from the beginning
06:05:39 <valentine97> Okay. I'm just nervous about 'rebooting" to anything because of "your device may fail to boot" warning I'm seeing.
06:05:48 <valentine97> If it's not an issue I'll just try again.
06:06:06 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: It might fail to boot, but it's not bricked
06:06:31 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: You should be fine trying again
06:06:54 <valentine97> Oh, okay. I was terrified of any more setbacks. Thank you!
06:25:51 <nscnt[m]> The name adb should never be dropped except when mentioning what the user should NOT use. It gives the other device a lot of power over your phone and shouldn't be used for a phone you want to call secure. adb works on the level of the operating system and can't detect your device because it's in the bootloader menu
06:26:33 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: Any feedback?
06:28:38 <valentine97> Back to the initial problem of "restarting device" and being stuck? I may just be impatient, not sure
06:31:26 <nscnt[m]> valentine97: Try out another cable/port
06:31:55 <valentine97> Will do, thank you
07:08:06 <TH56> Hi everyone, I have a question about updates on my Pixel 5.
07:08:39 <TH56> It always says that they are downloading and after the download it says that they are being installed. Yet, this comes multiple times each day.
07:19:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Chris (@r​oundtheworldman) has joined the Telegram Group!
07:22:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> Soooo I've been reading some of the discussions on here and I'd like some clarification if possible . Does using multiple user profiles , compartmentalize them from each other like similar to qubesOS
07:25:44 <valentine97> I don't want to stop over any other users needing help here, but, it's working properly now that I actually went and tried it from step one again. It was the USB cable causing the issue. Thanks for helping me with something so basic. I was scared I was going to break something.
07:27:10 <valentine97> Now I need to charge this thing before it goes and dies on me. Thanks again nscnt[m].
07:48:13 <TH56> So does anyone have any clues why my updates aren't working?
07:51:16 <nscnt[m]> TH56: What's your current build number that you're on?
07:52:37 <TH56> RQ2A.210405.005.2021.04.05.20
07:52:58 <TH56> For the last 3 days it told me that it's download and installing updates.
07:53:59 <nscnt[m]> TH56: Mh... Have you tried restarting the device in the meantime?
07:54:15 <TH56> Yes, I tried that.
07:58:34 <nscnt[m]> TH56: You receive the installation notification, the process is displayed but it disappears without anything happening afterwards?
07:59:28 <TH56> Yes, I see the notification, the progress bar is moving, but when it reaches the end, I don't see anything that it really finished.
07:59:43 <TH56> Some time later, I get the download/install notification again.
08:22:27 <helloworldkk87[m> Does anyone have screenshot of what does it actually look like when Auditor app detects something like your bootloader is unlocked etc
08:28:09 <strcat[m]> red screen, gives failure message
08:28:12 <strcat[m]> doesn't say it passed
08:28:26 <helloworldkk87[m> Right got it, thanks
08:28:41 <strcat[m]> same thing if the version was downgraded, etc. which isn't supposed to be possible
08:29:29 <strcat[m]> the only stuff you need to check yourself other than it passing and still being paired from your previous pairing is that the version is up-to-date (i.e. you are truly getting the updates) and that the OS verified info is what you expect (no device manager, no accessibility service, etc.)
08:29:30 <strcat[m]> it does the hard work itself
08:30:01 <strcat[m]> in theory we could publish the verified boot hash for each OS release
08:30:21 <strcat[m]> but it already checks that the verified boot key hasn't changed (which verified boot does itself, along with downgrade protection, and then attestation provides the info as another way to check)
08:30:41 <strcat[m]> verified boot key never changes and corresponds to a specific OS + device model combination
08:30:58 <strcat[m]> verified boot hash corresponds to a specific release
08:31:03 <erred> fwiptables: firewall in script bash very large
08:31:16 <helloworldkk87[m> Got it, thanks for the answer :)
08:31:18 <strcat[m]> erred: does not seem relevant to the channel

14:08:24 <M9thplayer[m]> Not a big fan of the 5 tbh. Hopefully 5a will be better
14:08:50 <pkgbuild[m]> maybe only the americans could tell us
14:08:55 <Thor[m]> <pkgbuild[m] "The 5a is almost here 🙃"> Probably not available in Europe
14:09:16 <pkgbuild[m]> who knows who knows
14:09:38 <M9thplayer[m]> 🤷‍♂️
14:10:33 <M9thplayer[m]> 5a will most likely be better quality than the 5 if they learn from their mistakes and choose to improve the design
14:10:40 <pkgbuild[m]> the 4a is way more powerful than what we need for this OS anyway that's all OFF-TOPIC
14:10:59 <M9thplayer[m]> Fair
14:11:15 <GhostSplinterSix> My 4a with GrapheneOS is out for delivery. 💪🏻😎 Now I just have to pay the rest of my current phone off with Sprint so that I can switch to a provider that's compatible with the OS. 😆

14:28:46 <kpcyrd> wouldn't that also fail if the cli instructions don't work for me?
14:30:10 <strcat[m]> are you actually using the official CLI instructions?
14:30:36 <kpcyrd> yes, on Arch Linux
14:31:46 <kpcyrd> the output is from `sudo ./flash-all.sh`, I didn't paste the full log since it contains serials
14:32:42 <pkgbuild[m]> fastboot: error: requirements not met!
14:32:56 <pkgbuild[m]> you should enter also what happen before
14:33:12 <pkgbuild[m]> anyway the ./flash all should not work in arch
14:34:47 <Alain[m]> <pkgbuild[m] "anyway the ./flash all should no"> I'm on arch too. What's not working?
14:35:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s​abot7> Hey guys, anybody seen the error "Error: unable to claim interface"? on the webusb installer on the flashing factory images step
14:35:46 <strcat[m]> means something else is using it
14:35:52 <strcat[m]> you probably have another tab using it, or adb running, etc.
14:35:58 <strcat[m]> reboot your computer
14:36:01 <kpcyrd> pkgbuild[m]: https://paste.debian.net/plainh/5f66c453

14:36:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <s​abot7> thanks, yeah adb is running
14:36:22 <strcat[m]> kpcyrd: redfin is Pixel 5 not 4a (5G)
14:36:39 <strcat[m]> are you using the right factory images?
14:37:02 <strcat[m]> luckily firmware is compatible so it wouldn't have bricked it
14:38:17 <kpcyrd> luckily indeed
14:38:25 <kpcyrd> I see, I'm going to try again with the right image, thanks!

14:45:28 <Alain[m]> I don't understand what you mean by _`_daemons are limited_`_...
14:45:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Matthew> I tried flashing grapheneos on my pixel 3a yesterday. Couldn't get the web install to work. I had it on my phone...then flashed pixel oem back on...but now phone isn't recognized by graphene web installer...but google syncs w their web installer
14:47:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Matthew> I tried going back to get google to flash...then try again...didn't work.However...I messed up my phone and went back to Android 9 w google installer...but graphene website doesn't recognize
14:47:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Matthew> I'm on 10 now
14:47:44 <strcat[m]> if the Google site recognizes it, the GrapheneOS one will, unless you disallowed it
14:47:57 <strcat[m]> you cannot use it in multiple at the same time
14:48:07 <strcat[m]> suggest making sure that stuff is closed and restarting the browser
14:48:14 <strcat[m]> also not sure why you're using Android 9 and 10...
14:48:21 <strcat[m]> sounds like you're doing strange things
14:48:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Matthew> LoL. I know. My phone was acting weird... thought someone broke into it
14:49:02 <pkgbuild[m]> im on different version of arch and in my distro .sh is not working like every linux distro anyway you should also implement his functions before, i can't go over this.
14:49:18 <strcat[m]> what?
14:49:40 <strcat[m]> Arch is one of the officially supported OSes where the CLI guide is tested
14:49:47 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
14:49:57 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend people get all info about installation from our site
14:54:42 <pkgbuild[m]> in the manjaro i was using i couldn't get the updated libarchive-tools installed anyway i also had an issue with the cable anyway i said wrong that all .sh doesn't just work, they work but also need to get the deamon function working correctly.
15:05:56 <kpcyrd> pkgbuild[m]: you can skip that step on arch
15:06:33 <strcat[m]> pkgbuild: libarchive-tools is for Debian
15:07:09 <strcat[m]> Manjaro isn't Arch but for Arch, the standalone platform-tools section there is not used
15:07:14 <pkgbuild[m]> ok anyway was the cable my issue
15:07:23 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#obtaining-fastboot
15:07:26 <strcat[m]> it clearly explains
15:07:57 <pkgbuild[m]> i had to use the desktop wich have the usb-c or i couldn't even still get it
15:14:21 <noax8[m]> Are there some different camera apk or mod that can be installed in my Pixel 3a , so I can get a great user experience with the camera using grapheneos?

18:19:49 <entry1> <secrypt[m] "I feel like I joined an hostile "> You haven't! You can make any changes/implementations you want to your own OS. Of course they could be ported over to GrapheneOS if they seem viable and the lead developer sees a use for it. The project has existing things they are working on and they would appreciate your talent there. Welcome to the community.

18:38:05 <TheJollyRoger> Really glad to see you've got an interest in sending in patches and merging new features. If you like, I can dig up some of the specific stuff on the issue tracker; some of them go way back and a lot of them haven't been triaged.
18:38:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, I be well! How be the winds for ye?
18:39:00 <secrypt[m]> Yarr!!!! Send me specific stuff, I was hoping for some specifics ,
18:39:22 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Let me go and dig a few up, and there are also some development and coding style guidelines, just a sec.
18:39:27 <secrypt[m]> Awesome this is more of my style, good vibes and good lines of code 🤤🤣
18:39:42 <TheJollyRoger> Harr harr, indeed! :)
18:40:53 <TheJollyRoger> So, first up, there are a number of development guidelines, especially with respect to the languages that GrapheneOS uses, and code style, Daniel figured that it would be best to nail these down in advance, so they don't cause any problems later, so this might be worth it to bookmark for reference
18:41:03 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines This should be it.
18:42:12 <GhostSplinterSix> secrypt Welcome!
18:42:48 <TheJollyRoger> The website, and what Daniel's written there (or what Daniel's personally approved to go on it) is something of the "Bible" of all things GrapheneOS, generally it's the go-to area for most things related to building or using. There's an entire section on building as well which might also be worth bookmarking.
18:43:01 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm new to GrapheneOS but it seems rad.
18:43:26 <secrypt[m]> GhostSplinterSix: welcome , it is indeed rad 🤣
18:43:51 <TheJollyRoger> The next thing is the OS issue tracker, but before I link it, I like to go over a few basic insider tips on getting features landed in GrapheneOS
18:44:00 <GhostSplinterSix> Of course, I'm a Sprint customer and so I need to switch...
18:44:21 <TheJollyRoger> GhostSplinterSix: oh yikes, I hope you can get your number and such ported to your new provider, fingers crossed that goes alright.
18:44:23 <secrypt[m]> Ooo insider tips is what I want 🐒
18:44:51 <secrypt[m]> I've got it compiling , with no errors so everything looks neat so far.
18:44:53 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
18:45:26 <GhostSplinterSix> <TheJollyRoger "GhostSplinterSix: oh yikes, I ho"> Thanks. It should be fine.
18:47:11 <TheJollyRoger> So... I'm not a developer juuuuuust yet, so I'm going to have to contextualize this with what I do know at this moment, there will be some gaps in these, but the first thing to know is that Daniel Micay is very, very adamant that everything in GrapheneOS should work in concert to be designed to a specific threat model, and address a specific threat model. The thing is, he very very much
18:47:12 <TheJollyRoger> dislikes feature creep or the anti-pattern of implementing features willy-nilly to win "feature credit". So, if you're hoping to get a feature landed in GrapheneOS, something to take note of especially is to figure out and write down, using very specific terms, how your new feature fits into the threat model specifically.
18:48:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <l​p4678> What's this for ?
18:48:38 <TheJollyRoger> For extra points, reference his own design documentation available on either the OS Issue Tracker, or on the website to show that you've specifically taken into account what he's designed for and why and how your new features fit in with his overall intentions and design.
18:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> @lp4678 - a few extra points on how to land features into GrapheneOS.
18:49:54 <secrypt[m]> <TheJollyRoger "dislikes feature creep or the an"> Understood, I like the sound of Daniel, he sounds like a clued on dude.
18:50:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. He's very focused on things being correct.
18:52:04 <timetravelingman> Implement a feature that lets you make phone calls and/or text messages. Would be the cherry on top of a great OS
18:52:14 <TheJollyRoger> This one might be a bit obvious in retrospect, so I don't mean to be condescending by mentioning it, but it's surprising to a lot of people; a second insider tip is to avoid burdening the user. In his ideal vision, Daniel wants to have opinionated, safe-by-default settings and to eliminate user judgement or user error from the security picture as much as we possibly can.
18:52:16 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah. He's a good guy according to what I've heard.
18:52:39 <TheJollyRoger> So this means, user-configurable settings, buttons, knobs, tunables, or options should only be done as an absolute last-resort.
18:52:53 <TheJollyRoger> If all other options should fail or we have no choice.
18:53:09 <TheLoneWanderer4> Much like OpenBSD, no? Safe by default
18:53:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yes! Very much so!
18:54:36 <TheJollyRoger> I know that a lot of people who do "Custom ROM" development love to pile on all the buttons, knobs, options, and such and configurations to make their own personal analogue mixing console, but that opens up a horrifying pandora's box of allowing user error that we definitely don't want to open.
18:56:12 <TheJollyRoger> Those options should be ideally left to the people who know what they do and know how they should be set, so user-configurable options should be kept to a minimum. Where they do happen, they should be integrated into existing menus and existing permissions, to avoid creating a "menu hell."
18:57:50 <TheJollyRoger> The same goes for things such as alerts, notifications, feedback, etc.
18:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> Since we don't want to make the same mistakes that Windows Vista did with desensitizing the user with "You are about to do something obviously stupid, cancel or allow" dialogues.
19:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, let me think...
19:04:22 <TheJollyRoger> So um... when I say this, I'm going to have to add a hefty disclaimer that I actually don't program yet, so this is largely me extrapolating from writing documentation; but when I wrote an early draft of the FAQ, I went into it fully expecting that by the end of the changes, the final draft of the FAQ would contain almost nothing of what I wrote. Depending on how your code looks or how it
19:04:24 <TheJollyRoger> works, you might be asked to change stuff around before it gets merged, so it's best to go in expecting that it'll be a heavily iterative process.
19:05:26 <TheJollyRoger> Especially if the feature hasn't been discussed or talked about, if you have an idea for a feature, it's best to search for it first on the issue tracker, and view Dan's thoughts on it and how it might fit in with the existing model.
19:05:41 <TheJollyRoger> With that said, I'll go and dig up some of the stuff that's been talked about!
19:06:28 <TheJollyRoger> You'd mentioned an "emergency data nuke" function, which actually is discussed here, some of the pros and cons and discussion is viewable directly on the OS issue tracker, as well as Dan's thoughts on how it fits in. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/29
19:06:49 <secrypt[m]> Awesome I'll take a look at that now
19:07:08 <TheJollyRoger> A big part is down here, actually, dated October 16th, 2019:
19:07:33 <TheJollyRoger> > I hope you're prepared for whatever consequences follow as a result. This feature doesn't currently have a design sketched out and there's currently not much reason to think that it would be at all stealthy. It's going to be noticed that the data is being wiped and that the device has been put into a fresh installation state. It will be publicly known that GrapheneOS has this feature, as with
19:07:35 <TheJollyRoger> any other feature, so what happened won't be a secret / unknown question. It would be extremely difficult to provide any kind of plausible deniability for wiping the device, and even deleting a profile would be noticed. Wiping the contents of a profile and logging in to it as a fresh profile is a possibility, but it's going to be noticed that it's a fresh, wiped profile. It's not going to be a
19:07:37 <TheJollyRoger> secret that it was wiped.
19:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> --end quote--
19:09:00 <TheJollyRoger> It's usually little details like these that tend to be the catch, so that's why these discussions often exist.
19:10:10 <TheJollyRoger> Another one is here. Some of us were a little bit skeptical of relying on biometrics after first unlock, for unlocking the device without the backing of a knowledge-based means of authentication. There's a bit more to it though, and so Daniel discusses this here. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/28
19:10:15 <secrypt[m]> Daniel wrote this?
19:10:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, under "thestinger."
19:10:40 <TheJollyRoger> *"thestinger".
19:11:04 <secrypt[m]> I have a way
19:11:11 <secrypt[m]> A way that will change everything .
19:11:18 <secrypt[m]> Let me see if it works.
19:11:27 <secrypt[m]> Hardware encryption keys 2fa on the lockscreen
19:12:12 <secrypt[m]> Can't get better 2fa then that, I'm just messing about right now but I will get more serious after I find many ways to break grapheneos
19:12:28 <secrypt[m]> First its good to fiddle with it , and then get serious.
19:13:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, that'd be pretty dandy, via a challenge-and-response mechanism! The other way discussed was using a passphrase (taking into account that GrapheneOS allows for 64-character alphanumeric passwords) for first unlock/key derivation, then using a pin code combined with the fingerprint or facial scan, after the first unlock.
19:13:54 <TheJollyRoger> This might be one area that giving the user that option to choose a second factor -- and what form it takes -- would be acceptable.
19:13:55 <secrypt[m]> Yep challenge response keys would do great here
19:13:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
19:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> I agree!

19:15:13 <secrypt[m]> Time to integrate this baby haha
19:15:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, is that an STM32 micro controller?
19:16:55 <secrypt[m]> Jolly can you test for me?
19:17:04 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, I can't, not at the moment.
19:17:06 <secrypt[m]> I'm doing some quick changes and edits
19:17:29 <secrypt[m]> OK TheJollyRoger let me know when you can, I'll prepare something for you
19:17:42 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not actually a developer just yet, and I don't have any spare devices... :(
19:18:02 <secrypt[m]> 😲
19:18:04 <secrypt[m]> 😯
19:18:23 <secrypt[m]> Don't worry TheJollyRoger we will make you into a developer
19:18:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, I hope so!
19:18:31 <secrypt[m]> Developers are made not born.
19:19:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! I'm actually going to be heading back into school to learn a little more, so hopefully when that's finished, I'll be able to contribute some code, I'm actually pretty excited.
19:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> secrypt[m], I actually have to leave my desk again, is there anything else I might be able to answer for you?
19:24:47 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: release date for security theater edition?
19:24:57 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: Ahahahaha oh nooooo XD
19:25:18 <skwisgaar[m]> Better get to work on that :P
19:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hee hee XD

19:30:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, gotta go, see you later, shipmates!
19:31:49 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: see ya later :)
19:49:49 <vdge[m]> Hello people, If I grant an app 'files and media' permission, is there any place on the internal storage where I can place few sensitive documents so that app can't read ?
20:19:04 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> <vdge[m] "Hello people, If I grant an app "> Use separate user profiles
20:21:19 <vdge[m]> I know about the profiles trick but I can't seamlessly transfer across them unless I use some intermediary which I don't want to.
20:23:08 <vdge[m]> Hence, looking for a private folder in the same profile where scoped storage prevents access to apps which target android 11. (If such folder exists)
20:23:34 <raf> is graphene os is available for vince?
20:24:07 <Guest520> is graphene os is available for vince?
20:24:32 <vdge[m]> <raf "is graphene os is available for "> Of course no.
20:24:34 <Guest520> anyone?
20:25:06 <Guest520> any possibility in future?
20:26:01 <vdge[m]> Nope, it's a very old device and OEM stopped supporting long ago.
20:26:26 <Guest520> what about jasmine_sprout?
20:26:34 <vdge[m]> * Nope, it's a very old device and OEM stopped it supporting long ago.
20:26:57 <TheJollyRoger> Guest520: please read the FAQ in its entirety: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
20:27:19 <TheJollyRoger> Guest520: this should answer most of your questions on device support. The FAQ is required reading for this channel.
20:27:20 <Guest520> do you know any secure os for these phones? thanks for your response.
20:27:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> Security is a moving target
20:27:50 <TheJollyRoger> Guest520: other operating systems that are not GrapheneOS are not topical to this channel, but even a secure operating system cannot make insecure hardware secure.
20:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> Your best hope is to upgrade to hardware that is secure and being actively maintained; remember, exploits keep getting better, and security is not a matter of merit, but rather, a device's or a syste'ms ability to be able to keep pace with these advances in ways to break them.
20:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> *system's
20:29:06 <Guest520> I understood. I know google now a days tracing people and selling people's data everytime thats why I am searching something god.
20:29:44 <vdge[m]> * Nope, it's a very old device and OEM stopped supporting it long ago.
20:30:15 <Guest520> TheJollyRoger Thanks man .. Which device is most secure in 2021? any idea?
20:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> Guest520:  Pixel 5.
20:30:29 <TheJollyRoger> That's the one you should get.
20:30:35 <Guest520> it's from google :/
20:30:38 <TheJollyRoger> If not, 4a5G. If not, 4a.
20:30:45 <vdge[m]> <vdge[m] "I know about the profiles trick "> Hey TheJollyRoger can you take look at this and let me know whenever you are free.
20:31:20 <TheJollyRoger> Guest520: Google has been thus far the only OEM to be uniquely forthcoming with us on firmware, vendor support, and allowing full hardware security features with third-party keying.
20:31:24 <TheJollyRoger> In English:
20:32:06 <TheJollyRoger> They're the only vendor that doesn't cripple important security features and leave you with an insecure device if you want to run an operating system that isn't theirs. They are the only vendor that co-operates with other developers outside of Google in terms of things like firmware.
20:32:12 <Guest520> You mean after buying pixel 5 I need to install graphene os there? then it will be fully secured?
20:33:22 <TheJollyRoger> You purchase the Pixel 5, and then visit https://grapheneos.org/install/web and follow the instructions there to install it.
20:33:56 <TheJollyRoger> OK, so with respect to security: Nothing is fully secure, only incrementally more secure. Any security measure that was built by human hands, can be defeated by human hands. The best we can do is keep securing it.
20:34:16 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS does not bundle anything Google related. Nothing Play Services related, no Google services, because we consider Play services to be invasive.
20:34:38 <TheJollyRoger> *the best we can do is keep improving security, and pushing forward
20:35:13 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS also aims to improve the application sandboxing, isolation, and make it harder to exploit the operating system than Google's operating system, while avoiding invasive services such as the ones that Google forces on people.
20:35:57 <TheJollyRoger> Guest520: So if you want a secure, private handset, the best you can do at this point in time is buy a Pixel 5 and install GrapheneOS to it.
20:36:17 <TheJollyRoger> Follow the instructions carefully and to the letter, don't try to take liberties.
20:37:01 <Guest520> I totally understand. I know pixel 5 is a bit expensive. Thanks a lot. You are really helpful. :)
20:37:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, that's what I be here for, shipmate!
20:37:29 <TheJollyRoger> If the Pixel 5 is out of your price range, consider the 4a5G, or the 4a.
20:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a isn't going to be supported as long as the 5 will be, but it's $350, rather than $700.
20:38:35 <Guest520> ok I will think about it. It means If i speand more money then I will get the support for long time. Simple.
20:38:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
20:38:45 <TheJollyRoger> You got it.
20:39:41 <Guest520> What about other brands with google pixel specifications.
20:40:14 <TheJollyRoger> Those don't exist at this point in time. GrapheneOS would love to build our own hardware but we'd need the OEM to shoulder the burden of that, and the ODM to produce them.
20:40:34 <Guest520> oh got it
20:40:35 <TheJollyRoger> *OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer, ODM = Original Design Manufacturer.
20:40:56 <Guest520> So this os will build there on hardware soon.
20:40:59 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Guest520 "ok I will think about it. It mea"> >long time
20:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> Not soon, when an OEM steps up out of their own goodwill.
20:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> And is willing to shoulder that risk.
20:43:40 <Guest520> ok..Understood
20:44:10 <Guest520> Good BYE:)
20:44:13 <TheJollyRoger> Cheers.
20:53:25 <dazinism> vdge: EDS Lite on F-Droid allows you to create encrypted volumes.
20:54:28 <dazinism> The app works as a storage provider. Once the volume is unlocked you can see it in the Files app
20:54:40 <vdge[m]> It was kinda complicated last time when I tried. I will give it a go once again.
20:54:49 <dazinism> Also can grant access to files in it via system file picker
20:55:23 <dazinism> It was kind of getting old, but got updated recently to SDK28
20:56:38 <vdge[m]> Cool, will try out it out. I was also looking at cryptomator which is paid.
20:56:50 <dazinism> Apps can't get access to files in the volume unless you specifically grant them access
20:58:09 <vdge[m]> Btw, should I assume an app can read all the folders in internal storage even in android 11 with scoped storage media permission? I thought it's supposed to prevent it and only allow access to specific folders like DCIM, pictures, videos etc
20:58:11 <dazinism> Via the system file picker. Or you open the file manually from EDS Lite or Files app
20:58:42 <vdge[m]> * Btw, should I assume an app can read all the folders in the internal storage even in android 11 with scoped storage media permission? I thought it's supposed to prevent it and only allow access to specific folders like DCIM, pictures, videos etc
21:01:06 <dazinism> vdge: I've got a bit lost by the way they've phased it in and changed things. If you look under permissions manager and 'files and media'
21:01:52 <dazinism> Apps can have either permission to manage all files, or just media....
21:02:21 <vdge[m]> Yes, it's called files and media. I tried to read their documentation but it was all over the place with varying statements.
21:02:53 <dazinism> I think files that can manage all files have to be SDK29 or older
21:03:09 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "Apps can have either permission "> If they can manage all files, why do they have another special access permission called 'All files access'
21:03:22 <dazinism> So gradually less and less apps will be able to do that
21:04:05 <dazinism> Yeah think the special access 'all files access' is needed for SDK30 or later apps to see all files
21:04:35 <dazinism> Its not a smooth process for apps to ask for that
21:05:08 <dazinism> So it's a way to force app developers to use scoped storage
21:05:52 <dazinism> As a proportion of there users will get lost if they ask them to grant that
21:06:02 <dazinism> *their users
21:06:32 <vdge[m]> Yes, right now I only granted files and media access to only single app which is SDK30.
21:06:32 <vdge[m]> Lets say google photos which is targeted at sdk30 but it can still access pics from the custom random folder I created in the internal storage.
21:06:48 <vdge[m]> * Yes, right now I only granted files and media access to only single app which is targeted at SDK30.
21:06:48 <vdge[m]> Lets say google photos which is targeted at sdk30 but it can still access pics from the custom random folder I created in the internal storage.
21:07:56 <dazinism> Sorry you lost me?
21:11:55 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "Yeah think the special access 'a"> That's what confusing me. If the apps targeting sdk30 need 'all files access' permission to access all files, how is google photos able to access all the files with just 'files and media' permission. I'm not able to differentiate the difference between these 2 permissions. To put it simply, what are the folders on internal storage which are inaccessible to app which have just

21:47:50 <dazinism> vdge: but it does also have the special app access granted (which I guess I may have given it)
21:48:21 <dazinism> Yeah media is photos, videos and audio

21:52:41 <vdge[m]> I read that document and it was confusing AF.
21:52:50 <dazinism> Also tried to write stuff up in this wiki.
21:52:53 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/storage
21:53:09 <dazinism> May also be confusing 😃
21:53:54 <vdge[m]> <vdge[m] "I read that document and it was "> They claim media is scanned only from the above directories but google photos was able to access photos outside those directories with just 'media' permission
21:55:27 <dazinism> Which permission does have 'media' or 'all files'?
21:55:59 <dazinism> I just removed the 'special app access' 'manage all files' permission

21:56:43 <dazinism> From the Storage Backup Tester app
21:56:44 <vdge[m]> Just media only
21:57:38 <dazinism> And its now not got the manage all files permission when I check under 'files and media' in the permissions manager
22:03:11 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "And its now not got the manage a"> Can you link that app, I will make few tests.
22:07:58 <GhostSplinterSix> So, T-Mobile says that my Pixel 4a that has GrapheneOS on it isn't compatible with their network. 😒
22:10:38 <dazinism> vdge: looking at vanilla music player which is sdk30 with media files permission
22:10:59 <dazinism> It has its own built in file browser
22:11:15 <dazinism> Can see media files in any directory
22:11:23 <dazinism> But nothing else
22:12:01 <dazinism> Guess that what is suggested when you grant the permission
22:12:09 <jj> Hello
22:12:27 <jj> How do i instalate graph
22:12:31 <GhostSplinterSix> <jj "Hello"> Howdy
22:12:41 <jj> Good nd u
22:13:12 <GhostSplinterSix> Go to the website and there's a section that explains how to install the OS.
22:14:15 <dazinism> vdge: can't see stuff under Android/data though. But looks like possibly stuff under Android/media
22:14:45 <dazinism> not got any files there but can see sub directories under that which I don't see under Android/data
22:17:19 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "vdge: looking at vanilla music p"> Yep, just now I did test using this app, It can also see all files in documents and other directories. Looks like only google can differentiate between all files and media permission and whatever scoped storage means at this point of time. 😅
22:20:49 <jj1013[m]> <jj "How do i instalate graph"> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:21:28 <jj1013[m]> <jj "Good nd u"> Great. He got out of the room before even getting a reply.
22:22:52 <dazinism> vdge: it doesn't see all files, just media files
22:23:22 <dazinism> Android has a thing where if you have a blank file called
22:23:32 <dazinism> .nomedia
22:24:25 <dazinism> It shouldn't scan that directory for media. Not sure if that is functional with this permission
22:25:18 <www69> hi
22:25:21 <www69> anyone on?
22:25:51 <dazinism> I'll test....
22:25:55 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "vdge: it doesn't see all files, "> Are you sure about this? Couldn't find a sdk30 app which can read files other than media like pdf to test this
22:25:56 <www69> hi
22:26:09 <dazinism> vdge Yeah that works
22:26:43 <www69> i made a converzon in a photoshoping app
22:26:46 <dazinism> Using the .nomedia
22:28:38 <dazinism> vdge: do you have an fdroid client?
22:29:29 <jj1013[m]> <www69 "anyone on?"> First time? Yeah, I was once like this.
22:29:29 <vdge[m]> Yep
22:29:47 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "vdge: do you have an fdroid clie"> Yep
22:29:56 <dazinism> https://grobox.de/fdroid/repo
22:30:25 <dazinism> Thats the testing repo of the main seedvault developer
22:30:30 <Cliff[m]> If i want to make another graphene device on my macbook wich browser to use safari?
22:30:57 <dazinism> The Storage Backup Tester app is in there.
22:34:23 <ocras> Hi. I'm having an issue with "flashing factory images" step in the official installation steps. I get "Error: Unable to claim interface" at this step. The phone Pixel 4a, is on the fastbootd screen. How can I proceed from here?
22:36:00 <jj1013[m]> <ocras "Hi. I'm having an issue with "fl"> Have you tried a different cable?
22:36:36 <ocras> it is a brand new cable. i don't have a spare one
22:36:38 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "The Storage Backup Tester app is"> Yep checked it out. The app can obviously see all the files if granted that permission but denies to run with just media permission. Would be a nice  to check what files it can access with just media permission.
22:37:10 <dazinism> vdge: can see that with vanilla music
22:38:13 <ocras> jj1013[m] it is a brand new cable. i don't have another one to try with
22:38:44 <jj1013[m]> <ocras "jj1013. it is a brand new cable."> Oh.
22:39:24 <dazinism> vdge: pull across the menus at top Artists, Albums, Tracks. Last one is Files
22:39:55 <dazinism> Can see photos, videos & audio files
22:40:56 <ocras> jj1013[m] should I reboot to bootloader on the phone and restart the flash factory images step again?
22:41:23 <dazinism> But not any in a directory with a file called .nomedia in it
22:42:45 <jj1013[m]> <ocras "jj1013. should I reboot to bootl"> It should be already on bootloader.
22:43:44 <ocras> jj1013[m] when i got the error I was on the fastbootd screen on the phone
22:44:26 <vdge[m]> Ahh, thanks for that. It makes sense now. So the app can read all the files which system thinks it is media (i.e. known file extensions)
22:45:25 <vdge[m]> Google's description in their documentation was kinda tricky and didn't establish this fact.
22:45:50 <ocras> jj1013[m] what can I do now?
22:46:36 <jj1013[m]> <ocras "jj1013. when i got the error I w"> OK, then you should connect the phone to a rear port on the computer and stay in fastboot.
22:47:27 <ocras> i have it connected to the usb-c port on my laptop. there is only the one usb-c port on this laptop
22:47:36 <ocras> jj1013[m] I have it connected to the usb-c port on my laptop. there is only the one usb-c port on this laptop
22:48:23 <jj1013[m]> <ocras "jj1013. I have it connected to t"> Then restart the process. If it spits another error, please notify.
22:48:55 <vdge[m]> So you're good to save sensitive documents in any folder as apps targeting sdk30 on play store aren't allowed to read other than media. Apps which require to read documents like pdf reader need to use file picker when they start targeting sdk30.
22:50:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I just love how Apple and Google are making these steps in the right direction
22:53:13 <dazinism> vdge: as long as you don't grant the 'manage all files' permission.  SDK30 apps can ask for that, like Storage Backup Tester does.
22:55:44 <vdge[m]> <dazinism "vdge: as long as you don't grant"> I read apps on play store go through extra scrutiny if they ask that permission. Every stupid app won't be able to ask that unless they have legit intentions. Basically, google claims they will only give such permission to file managers and few select apps which really need it IIRC
22:57:08 <vdge[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> I just love how Apple an"> Google should step up the game in this area though. Apple introduced giving access to selective media and a beautiful photo picker in ios14. Community is pulling back google to enforce proper scoped storage.
22:58:52 <Cliff[m]> dazinism can i use safari to install graphene os it is not in the supported browsers list
22:59:13 <Cliff[m]> Would i have to download chrome on my macbook?
23:09:51 <jj1013[m]> <Cliff[m] "Would i have to download chrome "> You would have to download Chromium.
23:10:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I'm not sure about safari, but if I were you, Cliff, I would download chrome from the App Store
23:12:35 <Cliff[m]> Is there another browser that i can use then chrome
23:16:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> *chromium
23:16:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> And no. Not really, because Edge Chromium is almost the same thing as Chromium, though it is recommended for use by Windows users.
23:16:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Firefox has an unstable implementation of WebUSB.
23:17:26 <ocras> jj1013[m] the phone has been flashed with graphene os successfully. thanks for the tip
23:21:58 <Cliff[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<gochoingles> *chromium"> I is for my macbook i thought chromium was the engine chrome the browser?
23:22:58 <Cliff[m]> Chrome = google thats why the question if there is another option for mac
23:27:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no, Cliff, Chromium is a separate stand-alone browser, that works. Chrome is based on Chromium. Also, the engine for both is actually called V8 afaik
23:28:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> still, if you value your security, you should only use apps from the App Store for your macbook
23:28:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and Chromium is not available on the App Store.
23:29:25 <Cliff[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> and Chromium is not avai"> Yes i just checked so chrome is only option left thanks
