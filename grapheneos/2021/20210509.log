00:19:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hey: how is it going?
01:04:23 <timetravelingman> <helloworldkk87[m "The point of GrapheneOS is not t"> The "point" of it can be whatever you want lol
01:04:54 <timetravelingman> For a lot of people it is to de-google and there's really nothing wrong with that
01:09:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> "De-googling" is an ill-defined term
01:09:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You must trust Google if you're using a Pixel phone
01:10:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> To a certain extent that's true
01:10:39 <GhostSplinterSix> Degoogled is a broad term and can mean a lot of things. GrapheneOS is an option (the best in my opinion) among many to get away from Big Tech and their tendencies.
01:11:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "To a certain extent that's true"> AOSP doesn't have Google proprietary apps and services in the first place, tbf
01:15:54 <akc3n[m]> <hey "i'm trying to stay away from goo"> Just a side note fyi, here's a write up by TheJollyRoger regarding Google/phone, etc. https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/GrapheneOS-General-Q%26A.md#why-does-this-project-only-support-pixels-i-want-to-get-away-from-google-i-dont-want-to-have-to-buy-google-to-get-away-from-google
01:43:56 <Purefallen[m]> So Mozilla recently managed to have the genius idea of enabling JS Execution inside PDFs for Firefox 88 onwards. I am not using  the PDF Viewer anyway but it raised awareness of the issue that apparently even more viewer have it.. for whatever reason.
01:43:56 <Purefallen[m]> Is JavaScript Execution in GrapheneOS's own PDF Viewer enabled and if so, why?
01:47:36 <akc3n> Purefallen[m], https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer
01:47:49 <akc3n[m]> Purefallen:  > Simple Android PDF viewer based on pdf.js and content providers. The app doesn't require any permissions. The PDF stream is fed into the sandboxed WebView without giving it access to content or files. Content-Security-Policy is used to enforce that the JavaScript and styling properties within the WebView are entirely static content from the apk assets. It reuses the hardened Chromium rendering stack while
01:47:49 <akc3n[m]> only exposing a tiny subset of the attack surface compared to actual web content. The PDF rendering code itself is memory safe with dynamic code evaluation disabled, and even if an attacker did gain code execution by exploiting the underlying web rendering engine, they're within the Chromium renderer sandbox with no access to the network (unlike a browser), files, or other content.
02:12:49 <SpaceDaddy[m]> I would like to help the development of this OS
02:22:36 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Imperial Space Moth: nice

02:30:46 <sphinx[m]> ?
02:30:46 <strcat[m]> Purefallen: no, it doesn't have that, and won't
02:31:30 <strcat[m]> Imperial Space Moth: your help would be very appreciated, I'd suggest looking through the projects and their issue trackers and seeing what appeals to you
02:31:50 <strcat[m]> and if you want to work on the OS itself https://grapheneos.org/build
03:57:49 <SpaceDaddy[m]> let's do it
04:03:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Imperial Space Moth: accept the invite
04:34:40 <jjstopper[m]> Is there anything about Grapheneos that would not allow my to add and  save an APN under Access Point Names. When I try to add one and hit save nothing saves
05:15:52 <Thatcher[m]> <SpaceDaddy[m] "let's do it"> I like your attitude. üëç Let's chip in and assist in making GrapheneOS even better!
05:16:29 <joltman[m]> after several hours of full format of 128gb flash drive on Win10, i ended up getting the same "volume too big for FAT32" error. It seems newer versions of windows intentionally don't let you format drives bigger than 32gb as FAT32. will probably have to use 3rd party software or linux instead. annoying, but whatever. anyone know if ext4 usb drives are recognized by Pixel 3XL? probably would be superior to FAT32 if it's
05:16:29 <joltman[m]> supported.
05:20:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <joltman[m] "after several hours of full form"> FAT32 doesn't really support anything beyond 32 GB
05:21:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does have a theoretical limit of 16 TB
05:21:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> But can it do so efficiently?
05:22:35 <strcat[m]> joltman: ext4 isn't an appropriate filesystem for a removable drive and will never be supported
05:22:41 <strcat[m]> exFAT will eventually be supported
05:23:14 <strcat[m]> ext4 isn't meant to be usable that way due to mandatory POSIX permissions, etc.
05:24:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ext4 technically can be supported
05:24:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> But not as a removable drive
05:24:35 <strcat[m]> it's not an appropriate filesystem for the use case
05:24:37 <strcat[m]> and won't be supported
05:24:38 <strcat[m]> as I said
05:24:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only for adoptable storage
05:24:44 <strcat[m]> fat32 does not have a 32GB limit
05:24:48 <strcat[m]> that's a Windows limit
05:24:56 <strcat[m]> and it supports drives formatted elsewhere with a larger size
05:25:36 <strcat[m]> Windows is off-topic
05:36:28 <joltman[m]> is anything other than FAT32 supported now?
05:52:57 <strcat[m]> no
05:53:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: we can add exfat support
05:53:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not really hard to do so
05:55:52 <strcat[m]> we're not adding out-of-tree exfat support
05:56:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Aight
05:56:14 <strcat[m]> I've made this really clear before, what we do is the opposite of adding a bunch of attack surface through a half-baked out-of-tree kernel module
06:13:25 <SpaceDaddy[m]> heard
06:16:15 <evdevd> I thought exfat drivers were merged in mainline now
06:16:33 <evdevd> Or is that only in recent 5.x kernels?
06:18:33 <proweb> Help with installation - My laptop is booted into ubuntu 20.04. I want to install graphene os into google pixel 5 redfin. I am doing the webusb install using the browser google chrome. I clicked "Unlock bootloader" and it worked. I click "Download release" and I am stuck with "Error: undefined"
06:19:27 <evdevd> do you have android-udev-rules installed?
06:20:45 <proweb> evdevd I have not. I will try that
06:24:24 <proweb> "On Arch Linux, install the android-udev package. On Debian and Ubuntu, install the android-sdk-platform-tools-common package." Since I am on Ubuntu I have android-sdk-platform-tools-common package installed and I have the error. Should I install android-udev also?
06:30:32 <evdevd> no. if not having that package is not the issue idk about anything past that
06:31:37 <strcat[m]> proweb: is it booted into fastboot mode?
06:32:13 <proweb> strcat[m] Yes the phone shows "Fastboot Mode"
06:43:54 <proweb2> I tried google chrome and ungoogled-chromium. I get the same error. I tried from firefox, the device wont even detect I guess it is because FF doesn't have webusb support.
06:55:53 <proweb2> Chromium browser gives the error "Access denied". Installation guide says chromium on ubuntu is unsupported, still worth a try.
06:59:10 <Pratyush[m]> i am on Ubuntu based distro, web installer just works as long as you have proper fastboot configured.
07:00:16 <proweb2> Pratyush[m] which browser did you use? Did you install additional software related to android on your ubuntu?
07:00:51 <Pratyush[m]> sad; chrome
07:07:50 <proweb2> Pratyush[m]: Ubuntu and Google chrome version that you used?
07:10:44 <Pratyush[m]> UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal,
07:10:44 <Pratyush[m]> google-chrome-stable/stable,now 90.0.4430.93-1 amd64 [installed]
07:12:08 <Pratyush[m]> proweb2:  https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device#setting-up

07:47:25 <cx2[m]> Friends‚Ä¶ Two questions.
07:47:25 <cx2[m]> 1. Do the radios in the Primary user continue to TX/RX when logged into a secondary user? Example: Would it be advised / necessary to run a VPN in both the Primary and Secondary profiles? (As far as I am aware Global VPN is not yet a thing‚Ä¶)
07:47:57 <cx2[m]> 2. Does seed vault work across users or do they need to be backed up separately?
07:52:29 <strcat[m]> the active user profile sets the network configuration
07:52:31 <strcat[m]> you need to set up the VPN in each
07:52:41 <strcat[m]> Seedvault is per-user, owner user backs up system stuff
07:53:47 <cx2[m]> Great, thanks!
07:53:47 <cx2[m]> I remember the topic of global vpn a while back‚Ä¶ is that something that is possible? Out of scope?
08:24:08 <strcat[m]> not wanted
08:24:19 <strcat[m]> we want per-profile VPNs not a global one, that would be bad
08:24:27 <strcat[m]> the current way is halfway to what we want
08:24:44 <strcat[m]> cx2: the VPN functionality is *already* global, that's the problem
08:25:02 <strcat[m]> per-user configuration is good, what needs changing is per-user implementation of it too
08:25:42 <strcat[m]> so at least the UI is done correctly
08:26:00 <strcat[m]> right now you can set up the same VPN everywhere and get that but what's really wanted is being able to have per-profile VPNs so they aren't tied together from using the same one
08:28:02 <donkykong[m]> Not sure if its ment to happen or not but every time I connect a k400 wireless keyboard to my two gos phones once I disconnected the USB dongle the phone reboots
08:29:20 <donkykong[m]> Also is there a good way to get the phone working on a TV or computer screen?
08:58:43 <cx7dd[m]> In the build instructions for vandium the command "ninja" is used. But in the official chromium build instructions they use "autoninja". Why is that?
10:38:17 <Assyria> Trying to install graphene on pixel 4xl via web usb. Up to part where i need to unlock bootloader but it says no compatible device found. what to do? Im using brave or chrome. followed the insttructions of the website
10:41:13 <Assyria> downloaded a driver. seems fixed for that step
10:59:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A‚Äãtlantistux> Hello
11:19:58 <PyotrDoesTech> Hi, I have a stupid question or maybe it's not stupid.. i don't know... I'm about to buy a Pixel 5 phone and my question is if I could just directly unlock the phone and flash graphene on it or do I have to do the first initial setup, Android Update etc. before flashing GrapheneOS?
11:23:54 <Pratyush[m]> you can directly flash GrapheneOS as long as it's unlocked model PyotrDoesTech
11:23:55 <Pratyush[m]> you do have to do first initial setup but it can be offline only setup means do NOT have to log into google account.
11:27:14 <sphinx[m]> PyotrDoesTech: it's covered in https://grapheneos.org/install/web#prerequisites
11:45:20 <Assyria> Hey Guys im up to the part of unpacking the bootloader after downloading factory images. Its been 5 to 10 minutes and the blue status bar hasnt changed and my phone is still in fastboot mode and doesnt look like its starting to flash. Something im meant to do like unzip the file or something. Sorry not very tech savvy
11:45:59 <strcat[m]> sounds like you don't have a reliable USB connection
11:46:05 <strcat[m]> recommend reading everything there about that
11:46:09 <strcat[m]> it doesn't take long to install
11:46:13 <strcat[m]> no point in waiting like that
11:46:18 <strcat[m]> reboot it back to bootloader interface again
11:46:27 <strcat[m]> use the cable that comes with the phone
11:46:30 <strcat[m]> make sure it's attached well
11:47:40 <Assyria> reboot seemed to work. thanks Bud

13:18:41 <hypokeimenon[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Dont ping devs"> You can ping devs depending on the context/state of the room/conversation. It is just bad practice to single out particular developers out of the blue for questions that can be answered by any developer/contributor.

16:14:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> do you have a USB C port on your PC?
16:15:19 <Pratyush[m]> proweb:  which device are trying to flash ?
16:15:38 <proweb> GrapheneOS-Teleg: Thank you. Yes I have a USB C port in my laptop. I have connected the Google pixel 5 phone to it through a cable that came along with the purchase.
16:15:52 <dnull> proweb: Have you tried the cli instructions? I had issues with the web installer, but the cli ones are copy/paste and worked the first time.
16:16:20 <proweb> dnull: I am afraid to get into cli. But if web installer isn't working I have no other choice.
16:16:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i'm pretty sure that if web doesn't work, the cli won't fix it
16:16:58 <dnull> proweb: They might be able to help with the web installer, but the cli is really copy/paste
16:17:23 <dnull> Hulk: did for me
16:17:41 <dnull> Just my experience though
16:18:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> quite a lot of folks just copy.pasted the cli, and mistaken pixel 4a with pixel 4a 5g images
16:18:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> got irreversibly bricked at the end
16:18:26 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: I have run the usermod and udevadm commands as you gave.
16:18:38 <dnull> They said they have a pixel 5. Same as I do.
16:18:59 <dnull> Otherwise I wouldn't have recommended it.
16:19:13 <proweb> I am staring at the bootloader screen of my phone. It saays Product revision: redfin MP1.0(ROW)
16:20:41 <proweb> I ran these commands before clicking the webusb buttons on the install page hoping it would help.
16:20:42 <proweb> sudo usermod -aG plugdev <your-linux-username>
16:20:42 <proweb> apt-get install android-sdk-platform-tools-common

16:21:49 <Pratyush[m]> <proweb "sudo usermod -aG plugdev <your-l"> proweb:  ouch, replace <your-linux-username> with your actual linux username or if you don't know your username $USER will work just fine.
16:22:36 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: I had replaced the username with the correct name. I run the command `id` now and I can see plugdev group added to my user
16:23:29 <proweb> Are there many versions of google pixel 5 or is there only one?
16:23:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i would recommend to delete everything and start over
16:23:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> here is one way of getting correct udev rules

16:24:22 <Pratyush[m]> <proweb "Are there many versions of googl"> afaik there is only one.
16:25:08 <Pratyush[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> https://github.com/M0Rf3"> device is getting recognized, that's why unlocking works.
16:25:43 <proweb> GrapheneOS-Teleg: I dont have the adb command installed. The official install page doesn't mention that. Do I need to install it?
16:26:03 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> No
16:26:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> nope, you don't need adb, just the udev
16:26:46 <proweb> The device is getting recognized by the webusb. I can see in the browser page when I click the lock icon "Pixel 5 USB device"
16:26:48 <Pratyush[m]> proweb:  you don't need adb, just a question are you comfortable checking your browser console for error ?

16:34:38 <Pratyush[m]> but if you never used terminal before waiting for sometime while someone from admin reply is also an option.

16:43:05 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: No. This is a brand new ubuntu 20.10 booted from live usb, and a brand new google chrome browser installed. No modifications done to the os or browser.
16:45:27 <Pratyush[m]> just check chrome://settings/cookies to make sure,
16:45:27 <Pratyush[m]> because blocking cookies give me same error

16:55:18 <Pratyush[m]> proweb:  once download instruction is easy to follow //
16:55:18 <Pratyush[m]> you can check https://grapheneos.org/install/cli or just drop a message here
16:55:47 <dnull> Huh
16:56:00 <dnull> Offering the cli instructions.
16:56:02 <dnull> Odd.
16:56:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i might owe you an apology dnull
16:57:34 <Pratyush[m]> dnull:  i don't any choice, there is something wrong with installer or browser
16:57:41 <dnull> Hulk: hahaha no worries.
16:58:06 <dnull> Pratyush[m]: I mentioned cli at the beginning
16:58:18 <dnull> I had issues with the web installer too
16:58:32 <dnull> Cli worked like a charm
17:00:10 <Pratyush[m]> dnull: unless i have a good reason, i don't recommend cli. in this case may be browser or installer is broken.
17:00:10 <Pratyush[m]> (imo cli works like a charm but it's not a good reason web installer works great too)
17:00:30 <dnull> Yeah, I agree
17:00:48 <dnull> I'd much rather people use the web installer too
17:01:03 <dnull> Just relating my own experience
17:01:39 <proweb> I prefer web installer too. I am good with cli but I don't wanna mess things and brick the device.
17:02:00 <dnull> proweb: Just copy/paste
17:27:50 <proweb> I have downloaded the zip file for redfin. I am going to install from cli. The install page says something about "Carrier variants of Pixels". Do I need to worry about it?
17:31:21 <Pratyush[m]> <proweb "I have downloaded the zip file f"> your bootloader is unlocked, ignore it
17:33:36 <proweb> " You can run fastboot --version to determine the current version. It must be at least 29.0.6"
17:33:37 <proweb> I installed using apt - apt install android-tools-fastboot. When I run "fastboot --version" I get "fastboot version 1:8.1.0+r23-8"
17:38:09 <proweb> Finally, installed fastboot of the required version.
17:45:23 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: I ran the command "fastboot flashing unlock" and I'm getting the output "< waiting for any device >" and the cursor keeps blinking at the output
17:46:17 <Pratyush[m]> proweb:  ouch why you installed fastboot with apt ?
17:46:18 <Pratyush[m]> that is old legacy, unmaintained fastboot, purge that one and install as said in guide
17:48:14 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: I have installed the fastboot as given in the guide. The version now correctly shows "fastboot version 1:8.1.0+r23-8
17:48:14 <proweb> Installed as /usr/lib/android-sdk/platform-tools/fastboot"
17:48:28 <proweb> I am not using the fastboot that is installed by apt

17:51:06 <proweb> Okay
17:52:58 <Pratyush[m]> proweb:  this's is what causing you installation issue the whole time
18:05:32 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: I rebooted ubuntu 20.10. Opened firefox, downloaded google chrome and installed it using "Ubuntu Software". I ran the command "sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common". I did nothing else just to be careful. Now I went to web installer page. Unlocking bootloader worked fine, but "Download release" threw the same error -
18:05:33 <proweb> 3bab072f.web-install.js:2 GET https://releases.grapheneos.org/redfin-factory-2021.05.04.01.zip net::ERR_FAILED 200
18:05:59 <proweb> I am using live usb for ubuntu 20.10, so any package i installed before must 've been wiped out.
18:10:05 <Pratyush[m]> "You should have at least 2GB of free memory available and 8GB of free storage space."
18:10:05 <Pratyush[m]> are you sure you have this much space in live usb? taken from Prerequisites part ?
18:11:13 <proweb> Yes I have the required memory and storage.
18:13:52 <proweb> Going to continue the cli instructions. I gave "fastboot --version" and I get,
18:13:52 <proweb> "fastboot version 31.0.2-7242960
18:13:52 <proweb> Installed as /home/ubuntu/Downloads/platform-tools/fastboot"
18:13:53 <proweb> which means I have installed it correct.
18:14:23 <Pratyush[m]> great :) carry on with installation
18:14:38 <proweb> I not give "fastboot flashing unlock" and I get "< waiting for any device >" with a blinking cursor waiting for some input
18:14:45 <proweb> *now
18:15:19 <Pratyush[m]> this is not a best secure advice but as you are on live usb run it with sudo
18:15:39 <Pratyush[m]> sudo $(which fastboot) devices
18:15:40 <TheJollyRoger> If you get that there are three possibilities: udev rules aren't set, USB cable is improperly traced, or USB firmware on the host does not support low-level device bugging.
18:15:53 <TheJollyRoger> If it works as root, you need the correct udev rules.
18:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, I can't stay to guide you through the installation at this time.
18:17:56 <proweb> TheJollyRoger: I have set the udev rules by running "sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common". That's what the install guide says.
18:18:08 <TheJollyRoger> proweb: Then it's one of the other two possibilities.
18:18:19 <TheJollyRoger> Or you haven't reloaded the rules by rebooting.
18:18:46 <proweb> Will running "sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common" set the udev rules fine? Or do I need to do some extra steps?
18:18:51 <TheJollyRoger> After the rules have been installed you need te reboot.
18:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> *need to reboot
18:19:06 <proweb> Can I reload it, without rebooting? I am on live usb
18:20:57 <TheJollyRoger> try "sudo udevadm control --reload-rules"
18:21:06 <proweb> I ran this # udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
18:21:06 <Pratyush[m]> <proweb "Can I reload it, without rebooti"> no, running with sudo is one options or reloading udev rules with
18:21:13 <TheJollyRoger> I don't recommend installing from a liveCD.

18:21:47 <Pratyush[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I don't recommend installing fro"> agreed.
18:21:53 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, that should do it. If it gives you <waiting for any device> at this point though, try from a permanent OS installation.
18:22:13 <TheJollyRoger> However, I cannot give you any further advice; installing in a nonstandard way, you're largely going to be on your own here.
18:22:38 <TheJollyRoger> I have to get going. Good luck.
18:26:29 <proweb> TheJollyRoger: The official guide doesn't say anything about live vs installed OS. I only recommends "OS running on bare metal" which is the case with me.
18:28:36 <proweb> Pratyush[m]: I have unlocked the bootloader using web installer. Could that be the reason for the output "< waiting for any device >" when I run the command "fastboot flashing unlock"?
18:28:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> +1 for "you should go with a permanent OS installation"
18:29:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it definitely might be the case proweb
18:29:27 <proweb> Okay I will do it from installed OS.

21:16:38 <proweb> Pratyush[m]:¬† Successfully installed GrapheneOS when I discarded live usb boot and used ubuntu installed on harddisk. Live usb boot had been the problem all along.
21:16:38 <proweb> A warning in the official guide about using live usb would have saved a lot of time.
21:17:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> congratz proweb
21:17:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> welcome aboard!
21:18:07 <proweb> Thanks for your help, all the community members who patiently helped me.
21:19:00 <proweb> At the end of the guide, there is something about removing non-stock key. Can I ignore it?
21:19:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> "Replacing GrapheneOS with the stock OS"
21:19:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> only if you want to replace GrapheneOS with the Stock OS
21:20:32 <proweb> Not going to android again.
21:20:33 <Pratyush[m]> <proweb "At the end of the guide, there i"> yes you should be ignoring that one, unless you want to go back to stock rom.
21:21:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> GrapheneOS is Android
21:23:50 <proweb> After installing GrapheneOS, I turned developer options off and OEM unlocking off. Anything else I have to do?
21:24:15 <proweb> I meant to say Android-Google :)

22:02:08 <jemma> Hi so im trying to install graphene over the web installer, at first i could flash the factory image, but it would never finish, leaving me in fastbootd on my phone for hours, even if i left it over night, now when trying that stage it gives me the error "Error: You need to download a release first!" despite me installing it moments before in the
22:02:09 <jemma> previous step,does anyone have any idea? i have no clue what to do - ive even tried various cables, usb ports etc just to be sure but i dont have another pc i can use
22:03:10 <strcat[m]> sounds like you're either using Incognito mode (it says not to) or don't have enough space
22:03:21 <strcat[m]> and/or don't have a reliable USB connection
22:03:33 <strcat[m]> clear a bunch of disk space because the browser only allows a web page to use a % of free space
22:05:04 <jemma> uhh hmm not in incognito and i am barely using any pc disk space this pc at max has half a gigs worth of stuff in saved word docs
22:05:51 <jemma> unless all my usb ports are broken somehow, but ive never had any issue in any other usb based situation i have no ideas
22:12:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> jemma: hey, let me try to help you
22:12:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which OS are you using?
22:12:38 <jemma> so im on win 10 using chrome for the install
22:12:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and does pc come with USB C port?
22:13:02 <strcat[m]> use Edge instead
22:13:08 <strcat[m]> you may have extensions breaking things
22:13:21 <strcat[m]> you may have AV software that injects stuff into browser and breaks it
22:13:28 <strcat[m]> and USB connection needs to be reliable
22:13:44 <strcat[m]> most USB-A to USB-C cables are non-spec-compliant broken
22:13:52 <strcat[m]> many older computers had broken USB-C ports
22:14:35 <jemma> yeah i tried edge previously at the start but it just didnt even seem to work at all, ill try again though as i cant recall why it didnt work, no usb c ports on this pc just plain old usb
22:15:33 <jemma> but ive tried all ports and like 5/6 dif cables most new
22:16:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it doesn't matter
22:16:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> most USB A to USB C cables are broken "by design"
22:16:45 <jemma> okay so edge says "Error: Unable to claim interface." on the first step - unlocking the bootloader
22:17:34 <jemma> right so is my only solution to buy or find someone to borrow a new pc that has usb c to c?
22:18:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or you can use a different Android phone with a USB C port
22:19:16 <jemma> oh right i stupidly had no clue i could use another phone for the install i can try that then
22:24:45 <jemma> okay so phone to phone i get this error "Error: Must be handling user gesture to show a permission request"
22:25:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Which phone are you using for this, and which browser?
22:25:46 <jemma> chrome and a huawei to a pixel 4a
22:27:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I really don't know what does the error message you sent means
22:27:17 <jemma> thats it word for word
22:27:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> What I mean is, I'm not knowledgeable enough to understand it
22:28:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Try again, try a different phone, make sure that you're not in incognito mode on your browser
22:28:38 <jemma> ah i see, damn, its making me feel quite syupid being unable to do the simple ver
22:29:06 <jemma> no in incog its a fresh chrome install as i dont use chrome on my phone
22:29:17 <jemma> no other phones to use
22:31:54 <jemma> any further suggestions or have i stumped you haha, thanks for trying to help tho!
22:32:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Yeah at this point, I'm just waiting for someone more knowledgeable than I to decrypt the error message
22:33:23 <jemma> haha think i must be close to a full set of error messages at this point haha
22:42:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> send the error messages you get
22:44:43 <strcat[m]> jemma: it sounds like you must have used adb or something and have it running
22:47:28 <jemma> uhh it was a fresh install but lemme check
22:49:00 <strcat> reboot the computer and try edge
22:49:05 <strcat> it's probably a USB connection issue
22:49:09 <strcat> along with whatever else is wrong
22:49:18 <strcat> most USB-A to USB-C cables are broken
22:49:39 <jemma> ive tried rebooting soo many times and doing every update i could find etc
22:51:34 <strcat[m]> if you don't have a reliable / proper USB cable then nothing with software is going to resolve it
22:51:42 <strcat[m]> you've probably just made things worse if anything
22:52:44 <jemma> well id trust the stock cable from google, huawei and from my jbl speaker to work reliably surely and none of them worked
22:53:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Cable from Google should definitely work, others are questionable
22:54:12 <jemma> yeah and this cable is box fresh so were the others even as i have old ones already
22:54:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Either way, you said you don't have USB C on your PC
22:55:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Which means that you're not using Google's cable when trying to install from win10
22:55:07 <jemma> no but ive done c to c on the phone too and got that error i sent
22:56:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> If I were you, I would just try installing from a different Android phone, by asking a friend or relative
22:56:34 <jemma> yeah not really possible in my current situation sadly
22:57:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that is sad(
22:57:54 <jemma> think ill try a phone repair shop and see if i can pay them to install it for me and if not i guess i wasted $450 or whatever on a paperweight
22:58:55 <strcat> you said you don't have a USB-C port
22:59:01 <strcat> the cable that comes with the one is USB-C
22:59:08 <strcat> jemma: use the phone again
22:59:14 <strcat> stop trying to use the computer
22:59:29 <jemma> i have tried the phone again
22:59:54 <jemma> same error as before reinstalled chrome twice disable any adblocky stuff
23:00:55 <tracker> Stop it damnit
23:01:00 <tracker> Hacker
23:01:16 <tracker> Dont hack my grapheneos phone and track my data
23:01:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> jemma: please ignore the messages sent by the user "tracker"
23:01:57 <strcat> channels are being raided by trolls
23:02:30 <jemma> yeah all good, didn't assume it was directed at me anyway
23:04:38 <jemma> do you guys think my best option is to just take the hit of what it costs to pay a phone repair shop to do it? i dont have any more resources here i dont think and if i cant do the babys ver of the install the command line one seems way out of my paygrade
23:05:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should not use CLI, if web installer doesn't work for you
23:05:57 <strcat> jemma: use your other phone to do it with Chrome
23:06:38 <jemma> i have tried stcat several times as weve been over already several times
23:06:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> he keeps on getting this error "Error: Must be handling user gesture to show a permission request"
23:08:41 <jemma> she but ya even with fresh installs of chrome i get it
23:10:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Please accept my apology for this assumption
23:11:07 <jemma> no worries at all lol

23:16:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> What does this error in the web installer mean? "Error: Must be handling user gesture to show a permission request"
23:18:01 <strcat[m]> probably that the browser is upset about the WebUSB permission dialog even though it was triggered by the user pressing the button
23:18:11 <strcat[m]> so, some browser bug / overly strict rule
23:18:19 <strcat[m]> haven't seen that before, maybe it's a Chrome A/B test
23:18:25 <strcat[m]> try Bromite instead of Chrome on the phone
23:18:41 <jemma> okay ill try bromite now
23:23:46 <jemma> okay bromite didnt get the error so heres hoping, just obtaining factory image
