00:01:59 * grapheneosbridge [irc] <JollyRoger> shives.
00:02:00 <grapheneosbridge> [irc] <JollyRoger> *shivers
00:02:02 <grapheneosbridge> [irc] <strcat> just for testing
00:02:22 <grapheneosbridge> [irc] <JollyRoger> Haha! Okay :P

00:09:37 <grapheneosbridge> [libera] <JollyRoger> I see you too from Libera.
00:09:44 <grapheneosbridge> [oftc] <TheJollyRoger> I also can see it from oftc.
00:10:00 <Railgun_Lover[m]> ddddddddddddddd
00:12:51 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <JollyRoger> Well, let me think...
00:12:52 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <Nebulawn> yes Quality is better than Qauntity
00:12:53 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <JollyRoger> This isn't Python, but something a lot of members here have been clamoring for is to allow users to enforce a PINcode based second factor, with biometrics login.
00:12:54 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <Nebulawn> what language?
00:12:56 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <2thec0> Wait did you bring back styles and theming with the recent update? I love you so much
00:12:57 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <JollyRoger> Let me check. I think at that level it's Java and/or Kotlin.
00:12:58 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <Nebulawn> my neighbors are blasting their bluetooth speaker one sec
00:13:00 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <JollyRoger> Aaargh that's the worst.
00:13:01 <grapheneosbridge> [matrix] <Nebulawn> I have a laptop with kali though its ok
00:40:46 <jelly> silly Sigyn
00:53:43 <dig_nerds[m]> Hello
00:54:03 <dig_nerds[m]> Do we have something to replace pixel's firmware?
00:58:02 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <dig_nerds[m] "Do we have something to replace "> Yes, firmware updates
00:58:28 <Railgun_Lover[m]> * Join the new room
00:59:00 <dig_nerds[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "Yes, firmware updates"> Where?
00:59:39 <dig_nerds[m]> #grapheneos:matrix.org?
01:00:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <dig_nerds[m] "#grapheneos:matrix.org?"> No, #jqfwiwmwbwkw:skakwbwjiw.jshwkwbs
01:00:38 <Railgun_Lover[m]> But yes, you are correct
01:01:21 <dig_nerds[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "But yes, you are correct"> What is the new off-topic room?
01:02:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <dig_nerds[m] "What is the new off-topic room?"> -offtopic
01:32:52 <strcat[m]> @room We're migrating to upgraded Matrix rooms without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos:grapheneos.org #grapheneos-offtopic:grapheneos.org . Please join the new rooms and you can leave these legacy ones to stop being bothered by pings.

03:53:05 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to freenode: #grapheneos:grapheneos.org #grapheneos-offtopic:grapheneos.org.
03:53:07 <strcat> We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but it won't be bridged the same way. We'll make a bridge via a leaner bot with a single user on both sides.
03:53:09 <strcat> After you move to the new Matrix rooms you can leave these ones. There will be nothing other than spam here.

11:54:32 <strcat[m]> grouxy: please move to the new channels
11:55:12 <strcat1> #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat if you insist on using IRC but the chat channels have primarily moved to Matrix

14:43:50 <aleeeeeeex> Hi there
14:44:41 <strcat> aleeeeeeex: this is a legacy channel now
14:45:12 <strcat> you should move to the new Matrix rooms (best experience) or #grapheneos / #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat (or OFTC)
14:45:27 <aleeeeeeex> Where can I found help with the installation
14:45:46 <strcat> aleeeeeeex: the new Matrix rooms ideally
14:46:06 <aleeeeeeex> Ok thanks bud
14:46:07 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/contact#community
14:46:13 <strcat> aleeeeeeex: where did you find a reference to this btw
14:46:18 <strcat> I need to update old references
14:47:04 <aleeeeeeex> In a post on internet
14:48:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> Where?
14:49:24 <strcat> aleeeeeeex: where though, it would be good to know so I can update references to it
14:49:28 <strcat> I can remove old bot posts on reddit
14:50:30 <strcat> also it messages everyone who joins the channel about this
14:50:49 <strcat> please go to the Matrix rooms
14:50:55 <strcat> read the message on entering the channel
14:51:01 <strcat> and https://grapheneos.org/contact#community
14:53:26 <strcat> if you really want to use IRC there are libera.chat and OFTC channels bridged with the Matrix rooms
14:53:40 <strcat> freenode channels are dead though
