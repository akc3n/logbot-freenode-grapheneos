00:13:58 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <strcat[m] "MrJack: and I don't know why you"> Its likely a braxman-ism.  He uses those terms a lot and is all on board for that specific ROM
00:14:15 <MrJack> ok strcat i won't be posting any further about my off topic issue in #grapheneos.  My intention is not to lower the quality of discussion here. I came to irc because discussion seemed to have moved from the subreddit to here.  If at any time my posts don't meet the standard of discussion or there's a more suitable community to post this is in,
00:14:15 <MrJack> please let me know and i will understand.  As far as lineage goes, I refered to it as degoogled because that's what it is often portrayed as elsewhere.  I have read some things suggesting otherwise though.
00:15:02 <TheJollyRoger> MrJack: you can join #grapheneos-offtopic, that's generally where we talk about some of the other things.
00:15:41 <strcat> MrJack: it is not 'degoogled', it does not remove anything that has to do with Google compared to AOSP
00:16:02 <strcat> MrJack: so, it's inaccurate, and probably based on the misunderstanding that these OSes are starting from a stock Android OS, which they are not
00:16:44 <strcat> MrJack: they use Google connectivity servers, Google as the fallback for DNS and some of the builds for devices include Google apps that are not part of Play services
00:17:01 <strcat> MrJack: not aware of any Google functionality they remove compared to AOSP
00:17:18 <strcat> MrJack: and as I said, it's off-topic here, but once again you brought up that inaccurate statement
00:17:36 <strcat> MrJack: we have an offtopic channel, so please at least discuss stuff like this there, but there is still a standard for discussion there
00:17:38 <MrJack> jollyroger facepalm, i thought i was posting there already.  dumb mistake, moving there now.  won't dig the hole any deeper...
00:17:43 <strcat> and I don't think it's helpful to beat a dead horse
00:31:58 <w1nter> I've looked through the chatlogs and generally know that rooting with graphene is frowned upon and strongly discouraged, and for good reasons as it gives a way to bypass security. However, as a developer and someone generally capable, I like have the option to root my phone so I can get at data that otherwise might not be accessible. Primarily this
00:31:58 <w1nter> revolves around a fear that I won't be able to transfer all my data to a new phone when I upgrade. Anyone have thoughts on this? Has anyone had issues importing data from an old phone to a new one with graphene?
00:32:09 <webchat2548> Two questions: 1) anyone know where the initial setup of phone configuration (language, date, wifi, password, pin, etc) are saved? 2) how does one uninstall and go back to stock OS (essentially factory data reset wipe) ?
00:35:24 <w1nter> I would image the answer to 2 is the same for any other android OS: unlock the bootloader and flash a new image. But I'm new to graphene, so not certain
00:35:36 <strcat[m]> w1nter: there is no such thing as 'rooting' GrapheneOS, it isn't a thing, if you replace major components of the OS that is not GrapheneOS
00:35:43 <strcat[m]> w1nter: the channel is about GrapheneOS, not derivatives/forks
00:36:37 <strcat[m]> w1nter: you'll have to actually define what you mean by 'rooting' and I assume what you mean is replacing the most core components of the OS with something that destroys the security model and exposes root access to most of the OS including the application layer
00:36:54 <strcat[m]> a fork of GrapheneOS is not GrapheneOS and you should make your own channel
00:37:43 <w1nter> strcat[m]: So by your logic, if I root a stock android 11 pixel 4, and ONLY change the boot partition, not the system partition, then I have a different OS or derivative OS? I don't think that's a common interpretation of what constitutes a derivative OS
00:38:24 <strcat[m]> yes, if you replace the core of the OS with something substantially different, particularly something that is designed to overlay things / change things for the rest of the OS
00:38:27 <strcat[m]> then that is not the same OS
00:38:46 <w1nter> What is being replaced that is a "core" part of the OS?
00:39:08 <w1nter> If I add a non-official Ubuntu package to Ubutnu, is it still Ubuntu?
00:39:15 <strcat[m]> if you're talking about GrapheneOS, there's no such thing as 'rooting', it has no relevance to this channel
00:39:26 <carbonatom[m]> <w1nter "revolves around a fear that I wo"> GrapheneOS includes Seedvault as an OS backup service which must be explicitly enabled, and it has the option to automatically restore app data when an app is reinstalled, so it wouldn't lose track of it being the same profile.
00:39:31 <strcat[m]> w1nter: if you continue talking about offtopic stuff after being told by a moderator that it's inappropriate for the channel, you'll be banned
00:39:33 <strcat[m]> final warning
00:39:58 <strcat[m]> this channel is about GrapheneOS
00:40:06 <webchat2548> w1nter I'm new too. Hence such questions.:)  I think my bootloader is unlocked (not sure tho) ... But I'm unsure what the tool is or how to go about flashing stock image. Device is Pixel 4a, btw.
00:40:09 <w1nter> carbonatom[m]: Thank you for actually providing useful information.
00:40:17 <strcat[m]> if you want to make a derivative of it with changes completely opposed to what it's about, discuss that elsewhere
00:40:34 <strcat[m]> there is no such thing as 'rooting' GrapheneOS and you haven't defined what you even mean by that
00:40:53 <carbonatom[m]> You can read this https://grapheneos.org/faq
00:41:09 <strcat[m]> there are production builds with the full security model and userdebug builds without it, where there isn't physical security and verified boot / SELinux policy are weakened to support developer root access via adb
00:41:29 <strcat[m]> but that isn't what people mean when they say what you said
00:41:54 <strcat[m]> you're talking about replacing the core of the OS with something else that's much different and very invasive, and that's a derivative of GrapheneOS which is offtopic
00:42:04 <strcat[m]> and the comparison you're trying to make doesn't make sense
00:42:16 <w1nter> strcat[m] why are you trying to shutdown this conversation? what are you afraid of? or what are your concerns? Did I ever mention making a derivative work? YOu keep repeating the same thing adnaseum... Are you a bot?
00:42:48 <strcat[m]> why aren't you listening to a moderator telling you that a topic is offtopic and inappropriate for the channel?
00:43:01 <strcat[m]> trying to contest moderation here is also explicitly against the rules
00:43:12 <carbonatom[m]> w1nter: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
00:43:15 <strcat[m]> you don't argue against a moderator telling you the rules in the main channel
00:43:45 <webchat2548> I used the webusb installer (with the help of strcat). But I don't see any webusb uninstaller. The faq does mention a method to uninstall using CLI but I'm unfamiliar with that method.
00:44:08 <strcat[m]> webchat2548: you don't have the stock OS anymore
00:44:13 <strcat[m]> if you removed GrapheneOS you would have no OS
00:44:33 <strcat[m]> we don't provide a way to remove the custom AVB key via a web interface
00:44:43 <strcat[m]> Google provides a web interface for flashing stock but it won't do that
00:45:31 <webchat2548> I see.
00:46:24 <strcat[m]> so you could use their web UI to flash stock
00:46:28 <strcat[m]> and lock it
00:46:36 <strcat[m]> and just not worry about fully resetting the device back to stock
00:46:44 <strcat[m]> or you could figure out how to erase the custom avb key and then do that
00:48:32 <webchat2548> what is a custom AVB key? what does that do?
00:48:54 <webchat2548> I'll try to figure it out.
00:49:01 <strcat[m]> the GrapheneOS verified boot key is currently flashed onto the secure element on your phone
00:49:14 <strcat[m]> you can flash the stock OS with their web UI but it won't remove that
00:49:25 <strcat[m]> you can lock with their UI (or use ours after using theirs, either way)
00:49:41 <strcat[m]> just letting you know it won't be fully restored back to stock unless you follow that section in our cli install guide
00:49:59 <webchat2548> ah okay
00:50:36 <strcat> people that are going to try to cause problems and argue against the channel rules / moderation are not welcome
00:58:07 <webchat2548> Okay, so it says, that I've erased the avb_custom_key successfully. I'm just stock on the part on now where to find or get the stock image for sunfish.
00:58:20 <webchat2548> stuck*
00:58:45 <strcat> webchat2548: https://developers.google.com/android/images#sunfish
00:59:00 <strcat> click flash next to the february image
00:59:04 <strcat> and make sure to set it to lock
01:09:10 <mrbrownbadger[m]> just flashed bramble with stable using web. all working fine except auditor: "invalid verified boot key fingerprint"
01:10:20 <bentley> question about the user profile "turn on phone calls & sms" setting
01:10:33 <bentley> i assume it controls access to call/sms history and the ability to initiate a call
01:10:55 <bentley> is it necessary if i'm only interested in receiving?
01:10:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hey mrbrownbadger[m], let me go check our issue tracker...
01:11:20 <bentley> i notice that an alarm set on the owner profile will go off even if i'm actively using a secondary profile
01:11:21 <webchat2548> make sure to set to lock, as in the bootloader? I clicked flash next to feb, it asks my browser my adb keys in order to communicate with my device. When I click "OK" it still shows No devices available.
01:11:42 <webchat2548> mhmm
01:13:19 <TheJollyRoger> webchat2548: to lock the bootloader, you'll need to be in fastboot.
01:14:09 <TheJollyRoger> bentley: I don't think there's a recieve-only mode for SMS.
01:14:27 <bentley> makes sense
01:14:39 <bentley> what about calls though
01:15:22 <TheJollyRoger> I gather the impression that that's all-or-nothing, as well, either the other profile has access to the phone, or it doesn't.
01:16:05 <bentley> actually the question behind the question is "why do i have to clear call/sms notifications twice, once for each profile"
01:16:18 <bentley> i suppose i could fiddle with notification settings on the owner profile to stop that
01:17:35 <bentley> turning off call history on my secondary profile would also mean i lose the ability to add recent phone numbers to my contacts, which i do a lot
01:17:51 <bentley> so maybe fiddling with notification settings is the better route than turning off call/sms on the secondary profile
01:18:58 <webchat2548> TheJollyRoger you need bootloader unlocked right, to flash stock sunfish tool?
01:19:08 <webchat2548> sunfish image**
01:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> I think this may be because the profiles should not allow the private storage of one profile, to have direct ass to the other, so the phone seems to have to append data to multiple profiles, which doesn't get synchronized from one to the other, but that's just my guess.
01:20:05 <TheJollyRoger> webchat2548: yes, you will need to have the bootloader unlocked to make any changes to the system partition or the bootloader, or install other operating systems.
01:20:35 <TheJollyRoger> webchat2548: Please follow the directions on the install page, they have been extensively tested.
01:20:47 <webchat2548> I'm just having issues with google's web android flash tool thingy, dunno why, just can't seem to see / connect to my device
01:20:52 <bentley> i was wondering if there was a single centralized store for texts but if it just maintains multiple stores and appends to each of them that would make more sense
01:20:53 <webchat2548> ok
01:20:55 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: they're trying to install the stock OS
01:21:00 <strcat[m]> webchat2548: we can't really provide support for that
01:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: oh.
01:21:11 <strcat[m]> webchat2548: we don't know about their web installer, etc.
01:21:45 <TheJollyRoger> bentley: Yeah, each profile draws from the same applications, but has its own data for those applications, which other profiles cannot reach into.
01:22:01 <TheJollyRoger> *which other applications, or other profiles, cannot reach into.
01:22:59 <TheJollyRoger> So if I have say, AndroChat installed in "Profile A" and "Profile B" they're both using the same app. But Profile A sees its own copy of its own data, and Profile B gets its own copy of its own respective data, Profile A cannot reach into Profile B's sandbox and vice-versa.
01:26:17 <mrbrownbadger[m]> > just flashed bramble with stable using web. all working fine except auditor: "invalid verified boot key fingerprint"
01:26:17 <mrbrownbadger[m]> so it's the phone safe to use?
01:27:06 <strcat[m]> mrbrownbadger: it's likely you just didn't update Auditor to v24 on the device you're using to verify
01:27:14 <strcat[m]> mrbrownbadger: if it is v24 and you're getting that error, no, it isn't safe
01:27:25 <strcat[m]> mrbrownbadger: update Auditor to v24 and test again
01:27:38 <strcat[m]> 99% chance that your Auditor is just out-of-date and v24 added bramble / redfin support
01:28:10 <strcat[m]> < 1% chance you got tricked into installing a malicious OS and so the verified boot key doesn't match, highly unlikely and I'm pretty sure you just need the new Auditor
01:28:39 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/24
01:29:03 <strcat[m]> it will be bundled with the next GrapheneOS release for other devices (the current bramble/redfin experimental release has it already)
01:29:03 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/24 I think this is it...?
01:29:07 <strcat[m]> yes
01:29:10 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
01:29:15 <strcat[m]> Play Store delays updates for a week or so for 'review'
01:29:34 <strcat[m]> anyway can install the update from GitHub for either GrapheneOS or an install via the Play Store on a stock OS / elsewhere
01:31:12 <mrbrownbadger[m]> yep it was out of date. update it via aurora and all is sunny. many thanks for help and all the great work
01:31:21 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome!
01:32:09 <strcat[m]> guess Google let the update through then
01:32:33 <strcat[m]> they have a warning saying that because of COVID it takes longer to review apps
01:32:35 <strcat[m]> as if that makes any sense
01:33:02 <strcat[m]> if anything it should be faster because people don't have to waste time commuting anymore
01:33:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, I wonder if they just do what I do to "review" code by using the extremely sophisticated method of hitting CTRL+F and typing in "im_the_nsa_let_me_in", finding zero results, and going "totally legit!" :D
01:33:53 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm joking)
01:42:30 <TheJollyRoger> (Since I don't even do that!)
02:09:49 <webchat2548> strcat[m] Thank you. (did CLI way - There were a bunch of 'archive does not contain ...' and 'File system type raw not supported.' in powershell which did make me kinda nervous but it boots StockOS now!)
02:13:18 <webchat2548> Before flashing images, I copied and pasted my internal storage to PC. If I want to like get all the stuff back do I just copy it all back? or will it create duplicate folders so need to do manually, to restore old apps and data?
02:15:11 <webchat2548> The only thing that seems different is the wallpaper. Does google grab a different wallpaper from online everytime fresh install or am I imagining things?
02:16:22 <letmeiinnnnn> hey uhhh first time, I was wondering, now that I have grapheneOS, what the best method to back it up would be? I'm mainly concerned about the photos I take.
02:19:14 <letmeiinnnnn> I mean to say, and it's funny, I plugged my phone into my computer just thinking the photos would be there just like vanilla android... am I doing sometihng wrong or is that a security feature?
02:47:04 <strcat[m]> > I plugged my phone into my computer just thinking the photos would be there just like vanilla android
02:47:09 <strcat[m]> they're gone now but that's not how Android works
02:47:28 <strcat[m]> not something GrapheneOS changes, you have to explicitly enable file transfer on Android
03:18:24 <lasseter[m]> What do you guys use to troubleshoot poor app performance?  Or even overall system health stats?
03:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hi lasseter[m], If I recall right there is a function in Android to send bug reports in the form of "tombstones"
03:20:41 <TheJollyRoger> But this requires developer options and it's intended for developers, it's not really intended for end users.
03:22:09 <dakotah[m]> What is a tombstone? In regards to this context.
03:22:49 <lasseter[m]> I thought I saw a menu somewhere in the settings that gave an overview of CPU load and memory usage at least.  But now I can't find it.  My guess is that probably saw it in another project.
03:23:03 <TheJollyRoger> dakotah[m]: a tombstone is an archive containing stuff like logs, traceback, Address Space layouts and registers, and sometimes a bit of information left over after an application crashes.
03:23:15 <TheJollyRoger> lasseter[m]: oh, like that, sorry, I misunderstood.
03:23:25 <dakotah[m]> Ohh I see
03:24:25 <redbeard72> I know we can't speak for every case, but in general, when you buy a refurbished pixel from a third party seller on amazon, does the seller (and Amazon) keep of a record of the ESN / IMEI ?
03:24:31 <carbonatom[m]> lasseter: it's in developer settings I believe
03:25:13 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: Something like that would be up to the discretion of the reseller and the employees working there.
03:25:58 <redbeard72> of course, but whenever I search for a pixel on amazon it's always a different seller, and I tried to ask one seller that question and they completely didn't understand it. So what do I do if I want to buy a refurb privately?
03:26:23 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: In that contingency you have no choice but to trust the reseller.
03:26:42 <redbeard72> are there other strategies you've heard of?
03:26:57 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: I don't want to scaremonger, but we have had at least one person in the past come to this channel who bought a Pixel that was stolen goods.
03:27:13 <lasseter[m]> <carbonatom[m] "lasseter: it's in developer sett"> Oh, I bet this is another thing I can't see if I'm not operating under the Owner account.
03:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> (It had factory reset protection, meaning it was likely stolen, reported stolen and then locked to that particular google account.)
03:27:51 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: the safest strategy you can take when buying a device for GrapheneOS is to buy it directly from the Google Store.
03:28:05 * carbonatom[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210213-222728.png (103KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VQAoMNoXpBzRBIoEebXvkLzV/Screenshot_20210213-222728.png >
03:28:06 <TheJollyRoger> I understand for many people trying to escape from Google, this sounds backward.
03:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> But that's your safest bet.
03:28:21 <carbonatom[m]> lasseter: click the build number a few times
03:28:25 <redbeard72> does the google store sell refurbished phones?
03:29:05 <carbonatom[m]> lasseter: then you'll become a developer and the developer options will be visible under system settings.
03:29:23 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: No, they don't, if I recall correctly, but that also reduces the chance you'll inadvertently end up with a bootloader-locked device that can only run the factory OS to zero unless you yourself order it.
03:29:26 <carbonatom[m]> * lasseter: then you'll become a developer and the developer options will be visible under system settings > advanced.
03:30:11 <carbonatom[m]> redbeard72: If you buy from amazon, you can always return it.
03:30:24 <redbeard72> that was my thought, carbonatom[m]
03:32:19 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, redbeard72
03:32:43 <ittybittyy> 'sup folks, new to grapheneos and just installed it on a new 4a 5g, fun fun. silly question but does graphene come prerooted or do i need to grab magisk?
03:32:48 <carbonatom[m]> Oh damn, I just leaked too much info about my phone lol.
03:33:16 <carbonatom[m]> Noone saw the screenshot*
03:33:59 <redbeard72> thanks, TheJollyRoger.
03:34:02 <carbonatom[m]> <ittybittyy "'sup folks, new to grapheneos an"> Why would want magisk?
03:34:25 <ittybittyy> root?
03:34:31 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: not supported
03:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> ittybittyy: GrapheneOS will not support root under any circumstances.
03:34:39 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: that wouldn't be GrapheneOS
03:34:45 <ittybittyy> oh really
03:34:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> I mean we technically have root
03:34:53 <ittybittyy> no wonder i cvouldnt find it in the faw
03:34:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just that you can't access it
03:34:58 <ittybittyy> faq*
03:35:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. All instances of GrapheneOS are signed, verified, and bitwise identical in production.
03:35:03 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: I recommend going back to the stock OS or using something else if you don't want what GrapheneOS is focused on
03:35:18 <ittybittyy> yeah i was a lineage user
03:35:31 <ittybittyy> innnnnnteresting
03:35:37 <TheJollyRoger> ittybittyy: I can explain a bit more about why we don't support root, if you'd like.
03:35:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ittybittyy "'sup folks, new to grapheneos an"> If our servers are ddosed we know who to blame now
03:36:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha oh noooo
03:36:14 <ittybittyy> sure, would love to know.
03:36:27 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: https://grapheneos.org/features
03:36:32 <redbeard72> also,TheJollyRoger, does it personally bother your privacy consciousness buying a pixel from the google store, and having them know your ESN / IMEI?
03:36:36 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: derivatives of GrapheneOS are off-topic here
03:36:57 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: GrapheneOS doesn't have that, so if you want to talk about making a derivative of it with that you'll need to discuss that somewhere else
03:37:11 <ittybittyy> ?
03:37:15 <lasseter[m]> <carbonatom[m] "lasseter: then you'll become a d"> Yeah, you are right.  I can see that if I switch to the owner account.  Just not when I'm operating under a user account.  Hmmmm.
03:37:15 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: it's opposed to the whole point of GrapheneOS
03:37:31 <carbonatom[m]> <redbeard72 "also,TheJollyRoger, does it pers"> They probably already know a lot more about you lol.
03:37:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> ittybittyy: root is a security risk
03:37:38 <pnrxa[m]1> <ittybittyy "?"> Rooting isn't supported
03:37:42 <ittybittyy> im not talking about derivitives
03:37:46 <strcat[m]> yes
03:37:46 <strcat[m]> you are
03:37:48 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: Google knowing my IMEI bothers me a lot less than shady third-party resellers possibly selling me stolen goods.
03:37:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Stuff like magisk makes it worse
03:37:54 <redbeard72> carbonatom[m]: the whole point is fighting back.
03:38:00 <strcat[m]> you're talking about making a derivative of GrapheneOS with Magisk or something like that
03:38:04 <strcat[m]> it's not on-topic for the channel
03:38:04 <ittybittyy> no
03:38:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ittybittyy "im not talking about derivitives"> Flashing magisk and rooting makes it a derivative
03:38:12 <ittybittyy> i was asking how to root
03:38:19 <ittybittyy> i didnt know it didnt suppoort root
03:38:21 <ittybittyy> lol
03:38:22 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: i.e. how to make a derivative of GrapheneOS
03:38:24 <ittybittyy> how then run adblock?
03:38:31 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: covered in FAQ
03:38:37 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: no reason that'd require root access
03:38:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> We run the same OS on every device. You deviate from that and you are talking about a derivative
03:38:45 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: I'm not sure how root access would help you do that
03:38:52 <TheJollyRoger> ittybittyy: So, the thing about rooting: All instances of GrapheneOS are actually signed and verified. GrapheneOS actually is intended to be used in production as a full production OS, which *must* pass validation.
03:38:59 <strcat[m]> ittybittyy: root access doesn't allow you to modify any of the OS images since there's verified boot and block-based updates
03:39:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: abusing the hosts file comes to mind
03:39:15 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: root doesn't let you modify the OS images, it will just break
03:39:20 <strcat[m]> anyway
03:39:22 <strcat[m]> it's off-topic
03:39:26 <ittybittyy> ...
03:39:33 <ittybittyy> k w/e
03:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> This is so you can get over the air updates, and full support for all the device security features such as verified boot, hardware backed keystore, and android remote attestation.
03:39:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: root doesn't let "> Magisk....
03:39:43 <strcat[m]> the discussion is over
03:39:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'd just bind mount or something
03:39:52 <carbonatom[m]> <redbeard72 "carbonatom: the whole point is f"> Their services and products are good. I see no need to fight back. Their data collection is a whole another story.
03:39:53 <strcat[m]> when I say something is off-topic I want people to stop discussing it here
03:40:07 <strcat[m]> I will set this channel and the offtopic channel to +m if there are continued problems tonight
03:40:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yes captain.
03:40:13 <strcat[m]> i.e. only approved people can talk
03:40:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: tonight?
03:40:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can you pm your timezone?
03:40:40 <redbeard72> TheJollyRoger: let's say I install Graphene on a clean new pixel, is it possible that if google wanted to they could enable factory reset protection at any time?
03:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: No.
03:41:10 <TheJollyRoger> Factory reset protection doesn't work that way.
03:41:15 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: that doesn't make any sense
03:41:22 <redbeard72> how does it work?
03:41:28 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: what do you think it is?
03:41:38 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: have you looked up what it is?
03:41:54 <strcat[m]> we have an FAQ section on it
03:42:13 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Can you pm your timezone?"> The country he lives in isn't exactly a secret.
03:42:27 <redbeard72> TheJollyRoger: told a story of a phone reported stolen, that was then locked to a particular google account. I was wondering if they same thing could happen once graphene is installed.
03:42:47 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: you have a serious misunderstanding about what it is
03:42:50 <strcat[m]> please research first
03:42:53 <strcat[m]> before asking a question here
03:43:03 <strcat[m]> you can look up what factory reset protection is
03:43:09 <strcat[m]> and you can see that there is a section on it in our FAQ
03:43:38 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: What Factory Reset Protection is, is that it simply locks a phone with the *standard OS* to a particular Google account.
03:43:39 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: what you're implying happened did not happen and it's just your misinterpretation of how things work
03:43:52 <strcat[m]> it also isn't something that happens after the fact
03:44:04 <strcat[m]> it's an inherent property of connecting the phone to a Google account
03:44:11 <TheJollyRoger> The idea being, that it renders the phone unusable unless that specific google account is used with it, so that it lessens the resale value of a stolen phone.
03:44:19 <strcat[m]> if someone factory resets it, it's necessary to login to the account to use it
03:44:23 <strcat[m]> that's what it means
03:44:32 <strcat[m]> we have an FAQ section on it
03:44:43 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft
03:44:46 <strcat[m]> please read it
03:45:03 <strcat[m]> it says how the standard feature works
03:45:10 <CWH[m]> Loving my Graphene on pixel 3a. Just sayin
03:45:21 <strcat[m]> it explains that it's an anti-theft feature, not a security feature, and that we aren't interested in providing an alternative implementation of it
03:45:26 <TheJollyRoger> So what I can infer happened was that someone who was running the stock operating system had enabled FRP, then it was stolen, and resold by an unscrupulous reseller.
03:45:26 <TheJollyRoger> CWH[m]: Yarr, glad to hear it!
03:45:46 <strcat[m]> and it's a standard feature for Play services not something only supported by a subset of phones
03:46:02 <strcat[m]> all phones with Play services provide it, it's a Play services feature using infrastructure in AOSP
03:46:13 <strcat[m]> we do not use that frp data area for anything
03:46:28 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: Then someone intending to run GrapheneOS bought that stolen phone from that unscrupulous seller, then found when they powered it on it wanted them to log into a particular Google account.
03:46:40 <strcat[m]> we could implement a comparable feature but we have no interest in tying devices to accounts for anti-theft protection where we'd have to provide account recovery support, etc.
03:47:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft explains everything relevant
03:47:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> How about just don't provide any support?
03:47:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you forget the password you can cry
03:47:27 <strcat[m]> then there's no point of an account
03:47:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah yeah
03:47:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Could just store a hash in the frp area for a password
03:48:29 <strcat[m]> we're entirely capable of implementing it but it is NOT a security feature
03:48:34 <strcat[m]> it has no security value
03:48:53 <strcat[m]> it's an anti-theft feature aimed at making the phone useless to a thief beyond scrap
03:49:06 <strcat[m]> the purpose is at most deterring theft
03:49:29 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make any sense to implement a feature that causes users to have their devices become a brick if they forget a password to deter theft
03:49:35 <strcat[m]> that would be totally irrational
03:49:49 <strcat[m]> because people often forget their passwords like that
03:50:13 <strcat[m]> so it would be causing a substantial number of people to brick their phones
03:50:32 <strcat[m]> compared to some tiny amount of device theft that in reality would be in no way deterred by GrapheneOS doing that
03:50:35 <thetranstocommie> does graphene is make any changes to android lockdown mode? I vaguely remember reading that lockdown could be backdoored, as could regular lock, and only first boot was actually secure.
03:50:38 <strcat[m]> I doubt that a single theft would ever be prevented
03:50:59 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: that's a serious misunderstanding about what 'lockdown' does on Android and iOS and I have no idea what you're talking about with a backdoor
03:51:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only first boot is secure yes
03:51:16 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: suggest reading our FAQ
03:51:22 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
03:51:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> The other times the key is present in clear
03:51:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I think the thieves would simply sell them to someplace in Asia then and vanish.
03:51:34 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no
03:51:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> However the rest is bs
03:51:38 <TheJollyRoger> Rinse and repeat.
03:51:39 <strcat[m]> let people read the accurate info in the FAQ
03:51:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
03:52:00 <strcat[m]> I do not want to babysit this channel
03:52:03 <strcat[m]> I'm setting both to moderated for now
03:52:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw this shouldn't be the case at all on pixel 4a 5g and pixel 5
03:52:17 <strcat[m]> the community is not currently capable of handling the responsibility of having chat channels
03:52:30 <redbeard72> so I searched "Factory Data Reset" in my Samsung andorid phone, and it's just about the feature of wiping it clean to the original factory state. Where's the part about locking it to a particular account?
03:52:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> They use wrappedkey so the decryption key is not really in ram
03:52:44 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: read the FAQ section
03:52:48 <redbeard72> I did
03:53:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or well it is, just invalidated after a reboot
03:53:03 <redbeard72> and surprise -- I'm still not an expert on the subject.
03:53:08 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: ok
03:53:12 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: read the FAQ section again
03:53:24 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft
03:53:28 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: there is nothing that can be added here
03:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard: From the FAQ: "Google's Factory Reset Protection ties devices to a Google account using a tiny, special region of persistent state not wiped by a factory reset. It prevents a thief from wiping the device to a fresh state for resale without being stuck at a screen for authenticating with the Google account persisted on the device after wiping."
03:53:48 <thetranstocommie> https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/kzs15v/how_law_enforcement_gets_around_your_smartphones/
03:53:48 <thetranstocommie> this was the post, in case anyone was interested. seems kinda unfixable, but figured I'd see if I just missed it on the graphene site
03:53:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> redbeard72: anyway if you do want to evict the decryption keys itself then reboot
03:53:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise lockscreen is good enough with lockdown for everyone
03:53:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: please, just link to the FAQ section
03:54:00 <strcat[m]> stop
03:54:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
03:54:19 <strcat[m]> what you're saying isn't accurate
03:54:22 <strcat[m]> the FAQ section is accurate
03:54:25 <redbeard72> Yes -- I read it. I also read in the comments above that it's part of any phone with Google Play, so I wanted to see where I could find it my samsung adroid, and didn't see it.
03:54:56 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: it's not some feature you choose to use
03:55:15 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: it's a standard feature when you tie the phone to a Google account
03:55:22 <strcat[m]> the FAQ section explains it
03:55:27 <strcat[m]> I don't think it needs to be repeated here
03:55:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <redbeard72 "Yes -- I read it. I also read in"> Btw please move Samsung device discussion to OT
03:55:51 <redbeard72> just trying to understand the concept anupritaisno1[m]
03:56:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't really care if OEMs break or remove an AOSP feature on devices we don't even support
03:56:09 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: you aren't going to get a better explanation than the one at https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft
03:56:22 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: if you don't understand that then I recommend searching for other explanations
03:56:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> redbeard72: and somehow moving to OT impedes your understanding of said concept?
03:56:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> I doubt it
03:56:33 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: short form chat messages are not a better medium to learn about it
03:56:48 <strcat[m]> redbeard72: you are NOT going to get a better explanation here, further discussion about this isn't constructive
03:57:09 <strcat[m]> we can simply repeat what that FAQ section says
03:57:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have been given a quick summary in chat and linked to the FAQ, there really isn't much that you'll get here anyway
03:57:18 <redbeard72> well anyway, you told me what I need to know, that's it's a feature on android phones that cannot be disabled or enabled
03:57:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> * You have been given a quick summary in chat and linked to the FAQ, there really isn't more that you'll get here anyway
03:57:28 <strcat[m]> it's a Play services feature
03:57:45 <strcat[m]> if you have Play services, and you connect the device to a Google account with it, you have FRP
03:58:06 <strcat[m]> it is tied to that Google account until you remove the Google account in Settings / delete it from your Google account
03:58:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: btw it'd be pretty cool if Google just took full control over the feature
03:58:18 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
03:58:25 <strcat[m]> it's a Play services feature
03:58:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Talking about intel ME antitheft
03:58:29 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: The TLDR is, if you're going to buy from a reseller, you are now shifting the trust onto them and Google. There's no reseller that's magically going to remove themselves from the equation.
03:58:30 <strcat[m]> they are the ones implementing it
03:58:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google pretty much could do something like that
03:58:43 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean
03:58:48 <strcat[m]> it's a Play services feature
03:58:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: intel ME has a hardware based antitheft
03:59:08 <strcat[m]> and?
03:59:19 <strcat[m]> how do you think the Play services feature works
03:59:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> We wouldn't need to bother with the implementation on GrapheneOS
03:59:26 <TheJollyRoger> That just isn't possible. You're going to need to trust the kids being paid eight bucks an hour stocking store shelves not to look at the bottom of the phone boxes.
03:59:30 <TheJollyRoger> Where the IMEI number is written.
03:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Set it on stock and go to grapheneos
03:59:50 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: doesn't make sense
03:59:53 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: leave the topic be
03:59:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> No frontend but it should work
03:59:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
03:59:57 <strcat[m]> the FAQ section is there
04:01:47 <redbeard72> Thanks all. Good night.
04:05:11 <strcat> this channel is temporarily unavailable for a short period of time due to lack of productive/appropriate discussion and lack of compliance with the rules and moderation
04:05:45 <strcat> people need to take some time to think about their participation here and begin behaving more constructively
04:11:45 <strcat> back to normal again
04:12:47 <strcat> most of the time moderation isn't required here but if there is issue after issue then the channel won't be able to have open participation
04:13:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yes sir.
04:13:32 <strcat> people have important questions to ask and need help with stuff
04:13:48 <strcat> and I do not have time to babysit 1000 adults
04:13:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: please check matrix PMs
04:58:59 <ron81> does anyone know if i can use Tmobile with graphene? i havn't gotten a straight answer and i want to use graphene as a daily driver
05:01:18 <conundrumculus[m> I have tmobile and have been using graphene with 3axl since October 2020 no problems at all.
05:01:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hi ron81, if it works with a fresh, regular, carrier-unlocked handset, unless it requires you to install highly privileged management drivers, it'll work with GrapheneOS.
05:02:00 <ron81> thanks all!
05:02:05 <TheJollyRoger> Just insert your SIM card and go.
05:02:16 <TheJollyRoger> *insert your SIM card and go about using your phone as you normally would.
06:04:24 <thebigbopper[m]> the pixel 4a google sells on it's store is confirmed to work?
06:05:22 <strcat[m]> yes
06:05:46 <strcat[m]> the official install guides cover which devices are supported
06:06:02 <strcat[m]> all variants are supported, but Verizon Pixels cannot be unlocked
06:06:06 <strcat[m]> don't buy a Verizon Pixel
06:06:26 <strcat[m]> if you are buying a new device from any non-sketchy retailer than you aren't going to get a Verizon device
06:06:32 <strcat[m]> if you're buying a used one make sure it isn't a Verizon one
06:06:34 <strcat[m]> that's all
06:06:58 <strcat[m]> other carriers may sell locked variants as carrier devices but they aren't permanently locked
06:07:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> buys a Verizon anyway
06:07:07 <strcat[m]> covered in the install guides
06:07:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw you can use the webusb installer now
06:09:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Install in the store itself
06:09:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or just press the unlock bootloader button
06:10:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll know if it works
06:10:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lol
06:10:21 <spamx101[m]> I'm using GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4 XL, but unfortunately the settings for controlling the refresh rate of the display seem to be missing for me... Can anybody advise / does anyone have any insight on this?
06:10:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: yes that app doesn't work on aosp
06:11:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can control refresh rate by adjusting display brightness
06:11:40 <spamx101[m]> App? I thought it was just regular AOSP settings for Pixel 4 XL
06:11:50 <spamx101[m]> What does display brightness have to do with the refresh rate?
06:12:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google uses a proprietary app to set refresh rates
06:12:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't ship it
06:12:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't work on aosp
06:12:51 <spamx101[m]> I see, I guess I just don't understand saying "app" because  Ithought it just appears in the regular system settings under Display settings
06:13:25 <spamx101[m]> I didn't realize that was Google putting custom proprietary code in or whatever that's not part of AOSP
06:14:17 <spamx101[m]> So my question still stands though, what does display brightness have to do with the refresh rate? Is there any way to properly handle and set the refresh rate otherwise?
06:14:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: AOSP does have refresh rate configuration for Settings but it has to be set up with overlays per device
06:15:03 <strcat[m]> and that configuration is not in AOSP
06:15:11 <strcat[m]> by default it's not available
06:15:14 <spamx101[m]> Personally, I actually love just having 90hz in most cases. It's just a problem for me because I've stumbled across one app thus far, Kodi, which does not work for whatever reason at 90hz and apparently the devs have no plans to add support
06:15:15 <strcat[m]> it would have to be set up
06:15:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: on stock Google uses an app to provide a settings toggle
06:15:33 <strcat[m]> spamx101: Google doesn't ship AOSP Settings app they ship an expanded Google Settings app which is AOSP Settings with extra stuff
06:15:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: ok but regardless of how they do it AOSP Settings app supports changing refresh rate
06:15:54 <spamx101[m]> Ahhhh that makes a lot of sense
06:15:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it has to be set up per device though
06:16:01 <spamx101[m]> thank you for clarifying
06:16:10 <strcat[m]> spamx101: similar to Dialer, Contacts, etc. where Google ships expanded forks of the apps that are somewhat kept in sync
06:16:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: so kodi doesn't work?
06:16:39 <strcat[m]> spamx101: stock OS is AOSP with a bunch of added Google apps *including* outright replacing certain high-level apps with Google apps
06:16:58 <strcat[m]> spamx101: and they also set various resource overlays, i.e. build time xml configuration
06:16:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why do people do this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
06:17:02 <spamx101[m]> anupritaisno1: yes, unfortunately Kodi just results in an empty blank black screen and appears to fail to load (or simply display) anything
06:17:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> If kodi is broken
06:17:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have overlays we can use to exclude apps from 90hz
06:17:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should have asked that instead
06:17:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
06:19:18 <spamx101[m]> Sorry, I don't really know or understand what an overlay is.
06:20:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: yeah but you asked how to set display refresh rates
06:20:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> When what you needed was a fix for an app
06:20:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Read that link
06:21:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can just add kodi to the list of apps to not use 90hz for
06:21:41 <spamx101[m]> strcat: So apologies, I don't understand what overlays are, but in layman's terms, is support for handling refresh rate on Pixel 4 XL's something planned on being added? Just wondering. I understand if not, and there's definitely way more important things to focus on
06:21:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
06:22:04 <spamx101[m]> anupritaisno1: Yes, because this still applies for everything else
06:22:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your problem isn't with refresh rates in the first place
06:22:09 <spamx101[m]> Kodi is just one app
06:22:11 <spamx101[m]> one example
06:22:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: then send a report of which apps are broken to upstream
06:22:36 <spamx101[m]> People will want to be able to control refresh rates for more
06:22:46 <spamx101[m]> Isn't this two different issues?
06:23:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: people will also want root for a lot of control, doesn't mean much
06:23:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> * spamx101: then send a report of which apps are broken upstream
06:23:18 <strcat[m]> AOSP Settings has support for configuring refresh rate and it'd make sense to set up the necessary overlays, etc. to make that work for devices supporting it
06:23:21 <strcat[m]> it's a low priority though
06:23:28 <strcat[m]> and it's unlikely that anyone is interested in working on it
06:23:41 <strcat[m]> so it won't happen unless you or someone else that wants it does the work of properly setting up the overlays
06:23:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wonder which overlay does that
06:23:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to see later
06:24:45 <spamx101[m]> I don't mean to sound needy or anything... I'm very much happy and satisfied with everything as it is. I was apparently just completely mistaken in refresh rate being a sort of "out of the box" functionality and that's fine, no expectations.
06:24:57 <strcat[m]> in Settings -> Display there is auto rotate, then color mode, then white balance, then peak refresh rate, then font size
06:25:12 <strcat[m]> but some settings aren't shown unless device configuration sets them up
06:25:44 <strcat[m]>         if (mContext.getResources().getBoolean(R.bool.config_show_smooth_display)) {
06:25:49 <strcat[m]> that appears to be the relevant configuration option
06:25:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I'll take a look
06:25:59 <spamx101[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: understoof. Thank you for explaining all of that
06:26:08 <spamx101[m]> *understood
06:26:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> I only knew about how stock did it
06:26:17 <strcat[m]> `res/values/config.xml:    <bool name="config_show_smooth_display">false</bool>`
06:26:24 <strcat[m]> Settings app has that boolean
06:26:41 <strcat[m]> so a device that supports this can potentially set this to `true` if it provides the necessary infrastructure to configure it
06:26:49 <strcat[m]> I don't know if we simply have to override that
06:27:03 <strcat[m]> it would be good to extract the resources from the stock Settings app and see if they use that
06:27:08 <strcat[m]> perhaps they do
06:27:22 <strcat[m]> if they use it, then we could try enabling it on the devices the stock OS enables it on
06:27:29 <strcat[m]> and see if it simply just works by default
06:27:43 <strcat[m]> it may require setting up more infrastructure or perhaps the setting already works and just isn't shown
06:27:50 <strcat[m]> this applies to various things like this, not just specifically this one
06:27:55 <strcat[m]> if no one is interested in putting in the work
06:28:02 <strcat[m]> then device-specific features like this will NOT be supported
06:28:11 <strcat[m]> our focus is on generic stuff across devices, not device-specific frills
06:28:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: tbh I'm interested
06:28:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> This will drain a lot of battery
06:29:25 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't want to change the default
06:29:33 <strcat[m]> just expose the configuration like stock, if stock exposes it
06:29:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: not changing the default
06:30:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101 anyway low priority
06:30:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> What I can do is fix kodi rn
06:30:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's the only app broken at 90hz or are there more
06:33:11 <strcat> what happens with it on the stock OS?
06:33:17 <strcat> why does it work there? assuming it does
06:33:20 <strcat> what's different?
06:34:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: it doesn't
06:34:46 <spamx101[m]> anupritaisno1: Yes, I completely understand and expect and want as @strcat:matrix.org  says to focus on generic stuff across devices, and the way more important stuff. It was only because, again, I mistakenly thought it was a normal "out-of-the-box" thing if you will, not a more specific issue. I am only aware of Kodi at the moment.
06:34:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> On 90hz the app just doesn't launch
06:35:05 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't work on the stock OS by default either?
06:35:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> I can force it to 60hz and it instantly launches
06:35:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: anyway the fix is easy
06:35:19 <strcat[m]> what happens with the default stock OS?
06:35:22 <strcat[m]> no custom configuration
06:35:28 <strcat[m]> I want to know what happens on stock by default
06:35:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: doesn't work on 90hz
06:35:33 <strcat[m]> factory reset stock OS
06:35:40 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: okay so does it or does it not work by default on stock
06:35:47 <strcat[m]> a factory reset stock OS
06:35:52 <strcat[m]> no custom configuration
06:35:55 <strcat[m]> that's what I want to know
06:36:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Does not work if brightness is above the limit where it switches to 90hz
06:36:29 <strcat[m]> so how is that not a bug in kodi that they need to fix?
06:36:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: we can work it around
06:36:55 <strcat[m]> how does an app even break that way
06:37:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google maintains a list of apps to disable 90hz for
06:37:12 <strcat[m]> I've never heard of a program breaking because the screen can go to higher refresh rates
06:37:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> We just add kodi to that list
06:37:38 <strcat[m]> that's like 1990s stuff
06:38:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: well you should see that list, there's a lot more apps than kodi that break
06:38:32 <spamx101[m]> anupritaisno1: Thanks for doing that. I had no idea a workaround solution like that exists and it can be that simple. If I had known, I naturally would have been able to do it myself and not bother any out you. Is there a link to that list or anything for future reference?
06:38:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: idk
06:39:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm the pixel 4 device maintainer
06:39:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> If I don't know what's going on with the device you'd be doomed
06:39:41 <spamx101[m]> Well, I really appreciate the time, effort and work
06:39:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've just gone through all the code by now
06:40:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway
06:41:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> We'll test and ship a workaround for kodi
06:41:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> And we'll report it upstream too so we won't have to maintain that workaround
06:42:33 <spamx101[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "We'll test and ship a workaround"> Thank you!
06:45:15 <spamx101[m]> Again, sorry, my intention definitely was not to bring up an off-topic Kodi specific problem they should be taking care of themselves. It was just an example byproduct of where I had thought I could use a workaround of controlling the refresh rate in the settings which I had mistakenly thought was a trivial default "out-of-the-box" thing that was just missing that I would have liked (but not needed) for other stuff as
06:45:15 <spamx101[m]> well. Definitely low priority, if anything at all.
06:45:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> spamx101: again, you must ask what you need
06:45:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not what you think you need
06:46:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw I think I'll submit that fix to AOSP itself
06:47:54 <strcat[m]> btw we switched to using the nginx.org builds for nginx so that we can easily switch to mainline nginx rather than LTS nginx if we need new features
06:48:02 <strcat[m]> let me know if there are any issues with the web services / sites
06:48:03 <spamx101[m]> You're right. I just still see it as two different things then - I would have still asked about refresh rate support for Pixel 4 XL for GrapheneOS here for in general and I would have still not asked about Kodi support here. Does that make sense? Or am I completely wrong here? Willing to learn and admit fault.
06:48:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: no self builds?
06:48:30 <strcat[m]> we're using the nginx.org releases now
06:48:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> K
06:48:52 <strcat[m]> I don't see a reason to build it ourselves it's not like we're building a server distribution ourselves
06:48:55 <strcat[m]> it's a lot of work for nothing
06:49:08 <strcat[m]> we have to build the nginx brotli module ourselves because distributions don't update it since upstream doesn't do releases
06:49:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> I used to build it with boringssl, lol
06:49:30 <strcat[m]> that's the 1 third party module we use
06:49:33 <strcat[m]> brotli_static
06:49:37 <strcat[m]> we don't use the dynamic brotli module
06:49:44 <strcat[m]> brotli_static is tiny and doesn't actually include brotli
06:49:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> ngx_brotli?
06:49:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or is brotli_static something new
06:50:01 <strcat[m]> it's just copy-pasted gzip_static with .br instead of .gz basically
06:50:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
06:50:15 <strcat[m]> ngx_brotli makes 2 modules: brotli_filter (dynamic) and brotli_static
06:50:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Got it
06:50:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> No weird bs like pagespeed right?
06:52:00 <strcat[m]> brotli_filter is ~700k without debug symbols, brotli_static is ~15k
06:52:07 <strcat[m]> as I said we use 1 third party module: brotli_static
06:52:10 <strcat[m]> our configs are on github
06:52:25 <strcat[m]> it's actually pretty stupid that the brotli_static functionality is not upstream
06:52:33 <strcat[m]> it would literally be ~20 lines of code changed to add it upstream
06:52:58 <strcat[m]> because they have gzip_static and they could just change that into a compress_static module supporting multiple extensions / encoding types
06:53:26 <strcat[m]> basically, gzip_static has a boolean to turn it on/off and respects the generic gzip options for headers, etc.
06:53:48 <strcat[m]> it checks for a .gz file and then serves that automatically to clients sending Accept-Encoding: gzip
06:53:53 <strcat[m]> brotli_static is the same thing for brotli
06:53:58 <strcat[m]> same code
06:54:05 <strcat[m]> different Accept-Encoding name and file extension, that's it
06:54:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Accept-Encoding: br?
06:54:31 <strcat[m]> run `curl -v https://grapheneos.org/install/cli >/dev/null`
06:54:43 <strcat[m]> then run `curl -v -H 'Accept-Encoding: br,gzip' https://grapheneos.org/install/cli >/dev/null`
06:55:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
06:55:12 <strcat[m]> you can see it just automatically serves that and says `Content-Encoding: br`
06:55:16 <strcat[m]> and it prefers `br` over `gzip`
06:55:22 <strcat[m]> when the client says both are supported
07:02:02 <strcat[m]> it's pretty simple
07:02:26 <strcat[m]> you can see our configs: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/tree/master/nginx
07:06:36 <strcat[m]> our servers have a lot of failed DDoS attacks thrown at them
07:06:46 <strcat[m]> so they're tuned for dealing with that
07:06:55 <strcat[m]> OVH has network-level DDoS mitigation
07:07:09 <strcat[m]> I'm really annoyed that a feature I want for attestation.app is NGINX Plus only though
07:19:58 <strcat[m]> our public server infra is all documented at https://grapheneos.org/articles/grapheneos-servers
07:20:05 <strcat[m]> we have a couple internal servers
07:20:23 <strcat[m]> production builds / signing are done locally of course not via remote servers
07:22:39 <strcat[m]> we could potentially pay for a really expensive dedicated server to give SSH access to contributors who don't have good local hardware for building development builds
07:22:43 <strcat[m]> but I have no use for it
07:23:31 <strcat[m]> I think I'd rather just build a local server for that and use dynamic dns for it since it's not a service that needs the availability of something public
07:23:44 <strcat[m]> OVH dedicated servers are pretty expensive compared to doing it yourself
07:27:05 <somenerd[m]>  https://grapheneos.org/articles actually seems cool
07:27:21 <somenerd[m]> any plans to blog about implementation of features?
07:34:17 <somenerd[m]> not sure if that's the intention of the articles section though
07:34:47 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it's not meant to be time-based posts like a blog
07:34:55 <strcat[m]> but rather stuff that is kept updated and relevant
07:35:07 <strcat[m]> so there could be a post about a feature but it'd be updated as that feature changed
07:35:23 <strcat[m]> and if the feature became obsolete it wouldn't have much to say anymore
07:35:30 <strcat[m]> it could document the history of the feature explicitly
07:35:37 <somenerd[m]> would be cool
07:35:39 <somenerd[m]> (imo)
07:35:41 <strcat[m]> but it wouldn't be a static page that doesn't acknowledge the feature is now obsolete
07:35:50 <somenerd[m]> I see
07:35:51 <strcat[m]> it would be turned into a history of that feature
07:36:13 <strcat[m]> it's essentially an area that we can have blog-like posts but that are kept up-to-date and have no specific published date
07:36:16 <strcat[m]> they are always meant to be current
07:36:33 <strcat[m]> the published date is in Git if someone cares
07:37:08 <strcat[m]> so for example https://grapheneos.org/articles/server-traffic-shaping is about something we do on all our servers
07:40:05 <strcat[m]> it would be nice if OVH offered more bandwidth for a VPS instead of needing to start having multiple releases servers that are kept in sync
07:40:33 <strcat[m]> will still need it eventually ofc
07:42:06 <strcat[m]> we have much higher priorities than making content for the site though
07:55:03 <neelix> Hi guys, phones just arrived time to install :D
07:57:19 <take_a_deep_brea> neelix:  all the best , and https://grapheneos.org/install/web
07:57:45 <somenerd[m]> this is for if you don't want to verify the signing key and are new to cli
07:58:16 <take_a_deep_brea> * neelix:  all the best , and https://grapheneos.org/install
07:58:30 <take_a_deep_brea> * neelix:  all the best , and https://grapheneos.org/install
07:58:32 <somenerd[m]> (the web ver)
07:59:18 <take_a_deep_brea> hey what why does the preview show the cli one
07:59:34 <somenerd[m]> redirects
07:59:40 <somenerd[m]> keep another slash
07:59:46 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/
07:59:47 <take_a_deep_brea> * neelix:  all the best , and https://grapheneos.org/install/
07:59:56 <take_a_deep_brea> * neelix:  all the best , and https://grapheneos.org/install/
08:00:12 <somenerd[m]> some sorta problem
08:00:13 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah lmao
08:00:46 <strcat[m]> somenerd: what's the issue?
08:01:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install is the old location of the CLI install guide
08:01:27 <somenerd[m]> without the slash, it redirects
08:01:28 <somenerd[m]> yeah
08:01:29 <strcat[m]> we moved the CLI install guide so we redirected that old URL to it
08:01:40 <strcat[m]> that's intentional to preserve old links to the CLI install guide
08:01:50 <strcat[m]> index pages for directories of pages have / at the end
08:02:05 <somenerd[m]> I mean, wouldn't it make more sense to redirect it to https://grapheneos.org/install/
08:02:11 <somenerd[m]> for people who are unaware
08:02:17 <strcat[m]> perhaps but then that will change the meaning of all the old links
08:02:26 <strcat[m]> the CLI install guide links to web install in 1st paragraph
08:02:49 <somenerd[m]> yeah it does
08:02:55 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/ is a new meta-page
08:03:00 <strcat[m]> it didn't exist before
08:03:13 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install was the old location of CLI guide and those links are preserved
08:03:18 <take_a_deep_brea> well that makes sense
08:03:20 <strcat[m]> that's just how we do things, we preserve links
08:03:22 <strcat[m]> we don't break them
08:03:30 <somenerd[m]> yeah makes more sense now
08:03:47 <strcat[m]> if I change the redirect then old links to https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#standalone-platform-tools etc. in IRC log and elsewhere
08:03:50 <strcat[m]> will all be messed up
08:04:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
08:04:07 <strcat[m]> example of an old link
08:04:25 <strcat[m]> you're typing the URL by hand but normally people aren't doing that
08:04:41 <somenerd[m]> yeah mostly clicking or copy-paste
08:05:19 <strcat[m]> so what we could do is change it to redirect to the new meta-page and add a bunch of #fragment redirects for links that were to CLI sections
08:05:25 <strcat[m]> but that's messy and atm we just preserve the old links
08:05:38 <strcat[m]> and #fragment redirects require javascript
08:05:43 <strcat[m]> the browser doesn't send #fragment to the web server
08:05:52 <strcat[m]> so if JS is disabled then people won't get #fragment redirects
08:06:10 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/static/js/redirect.js
08:08:13 <strcat[m]> I don't want to break things
08:08:17 <strcat[m]>  * I don't want to break links
08:09:09 <somenerd[m]> would probably break most of the old logbot links, yeah
08:09:10 <somenerd[m]> makes more sense now
08:09:46 <neelix> anyone tried installing the google camera app?
08:25:31 <mynacol[m]> neelix: I heard some tried with success. But I ask you to continue this topic in #grapheneos-offtopic 🙂
08:28:42 <neelix> mynacol[m], will do
08:31:53 <neelix> managed to install it
08:32:00 <neelix> graphene on the pix4a
08:32:29 <take_a_deep_brea> great !
08:32:40 <take_a_deep_brea> which one do you use  ?
08:32:47 <take_a_deep_brea> web / cli
08:32:50 <neelix> cli
08:33:02 <take_a_deep_brea> nice .
08:55:34 <xx> hello, could you guys please guide me on how to change the default pdf viewer? nothing for documents in the default apps.
08:58:44 <strcat[m]> you can install another app
08:58:47 <strcat[m]> there's no default set
09:03:25 <xx> thanks strcat[m] , i installed the other pdf viewer on the main profile, and was trying to read pdfs that were on the work profile. works fine and the issue solved after installibg the app to my work profile
09:04:39 <xx> and btw i would like to thank you for all the time and effort it is highly appreciated. i went off google cold turkey with grapheneos and been on it for the last couple weeks and it is the best imho.
09:05:46 <xx> middle eastren here and it is good to know that thr govt can not be nosing my digital data
09:09:09 <nonie689[m]> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mviTS_cIWXg
09:15:54 <strcat[m]> nonie689: please use #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for stuff not directly related to GrapheneOS
09:36:52 <zvl12[m]> Just installed Graphene on a 4a5G via the WEBinstall.... worked like a charm..no hick ups on the way
09:38:04 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
09:47:14 <xx> anyone using whatsapp on a work profile? shoukd i grant premission for the microphone while using the app or use it eqch time when needed
09:49:03 <take_a_deep_brea> xx: well discussion about apps takes place in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
09:49:16 <take_a_deep_brea> why dont you ask there ; )
09:49:47 <take_a_deep_brea> as someone is bound to interrupt you here , later on if not now
09:52:49 <take_a_deep_brea>  * xx: well discussion about apps takes place in #grapheneos-offtopic
09:56:26 <xx> thanks, i apologize as i did not know that there is an offtopic.
09:56:47 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem
10:07:27 <zvl12[m]> What (if) are the recurrent bugs/problems with the experimental GOS on 4a5G ?
10:09:55 <mrbrownbadger[m]> zvl12: just installed it. works flawlessly
10:10:54 <take_a_deep_brea> if there were bugs that were disruptive to UX then they would have been fixed earlier before being "released"
10:12:34 <mrbrownbadger[m]> zvl12 I've set the animations to 0.5 in developer menu and it's blazing fast
10:13:34 <take_a_deep_brea> zvl12:  just simulate your regula usage on the device
10:14:22 <take_a_deep_brea> phone call , sms , browsing , mail and other stuff
10:23:04 <zvl12[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "if there were bugs that were dis"> it's called "experimental" for some reasons .....
10:23:43 <take_a_deep_brea> zvl12:  yes , what i meant was you wont find something wrong that is obviously so
10:24:02 <take_a_deep_brea> it will take some time working the device before you find something wrong
10:24:09 <zvl12[m]> <mrbrownbadger[m] "zvl12 I've set the animations to"> sounds a great idea ! animations normally are for graphics/movies/games ? or serve another purpose ?
10:25:07 <zvl12[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "it will take some time working t"> i see, yes... i am running a stable 4a and the new 4a5G one next to the other and the "experimental" seems VERY stable
10:25:17 <strcat[m]> Auditor app version 25 released: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/25
10:25:26 <take_a_deep_brea> mrbrownbadger: developer menu is not for normal usage . i think using dev options may break somethings as part of normal workflow and that may confuse you as to whats the problem
10:30:50 <mrbrownbadger[m]> zvl12: animations are for the speed at which apps and menus open. on slower phones they hide the lag but on a fast phone it's just wasting time.
10:31:43 <take_a_deep_brea> also you can completely remove animations in the accesibility settings
10:31:58 <mrbrownbadger[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: i know and I'm all about security. heck i don't even use the owner profile but i just can't go back to the molases of slow animations
10:32:41 <take_a_deep_brea> mrbrownbadger: you can disable animations in accesibility .
10:33:46 <take_a_deep_brea> and what i meant above was not just from a security PoV but also because if you are on an experimental device you dont want to add one more source of potential UX issues
10:34:02 <zvl12[m]> it's worth disabling animations on a 4a5G or just waste of time as mentioned before ?
10:34:42 <take_a_deep_brea> disabling animations is readily accesible from settings without dev settings
10:35:52 <zvl12[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "disabling animations is readily "> just did it, indeed its super fast now ! good tip
10:37:11 <mrbrownbadger[m]> zvl12: try and see for yourself if you like it. i find disabling animations makes the workflow less smooth. some actions are instant some have various lag. the phone is fast but not that fast. 0.2 would probably be ideal for my tastes.
10:39:05 <mrbrownbadger[m]> also gestures should probably be the default navigation mode. the bar/button combination is not a very happy one
10:43:08 <ra7[m]> Just installed Graphene on a 4a5G via the WEBinstall.... worked like a charm..no hick ups on the way
10:43:09 <ra7[m]> this sounds interesting, i think this could b my next phone.
10:43:43 <ra7[m]> that first part was a quote...
10:45:05 <mrbrownbadger[m]> in home screen setting what does "enable grid options" does?
10:45:36 <mrbrownbadger[m]> didn't notice any change after enable it
11:01:19 <ra7[m]> hi all! -on a pixel 4a with grapheneos, does anyone know how to get sms messages to sound/show up when they arrive? mine can take hours to finally show up, even if i tap the screen to wake it up, they will not usually be visible unless i also enter the decryption phrase, which is incredibly tedious to do every half hour or so just to check for sms'. i have tried every imaginable setting, for weeks, even factory reset, but
11:01:19 <ra7[m]> nothing works.
11:06:40 <take_a_deep_brea> ra7: confirm the settings in Settings> Privacy> Notifications on Lock screen , Messaging (Long press in drawer) > App info > notifications
11:11:04 <strcat> ra7[m]: sounds like a carrier issue
11:11:17 <strcat> ra7[m]: make sure you're not using LTE only mode with poor LTE access
11:13:28 <ra7[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: 1st one: middle setting, show sensitive only when unlocked. have tryed show all with no change. 2nd one: nothing can bubble, allow interruptions, lock screen as above, override do not disturb, allow notification dot
11:14:38 <ra7[m]> strcat: where would i check lte setting?
11:18:15 <strcat[m]> preferred networks
11:18:23 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
11:18:30 <strcat[m]> make sure it's set to something like "LTE" not "LTE only"
11:18:47 <strcat[m]> unless you know that you have reliable LTE and your carrier supports proper SMS over LTE and VoLTE
11:22:46 <ra7[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: under settings mobilenetwork preferrednetworktype i have 3 choices: 4g, 4g only, 3g. it is set to first one?
11:25:57 <strcat> ra7[m]: yeah first one (4G) is fine
11:26:02 <strcat> some carriers call it 4G, some LTE
11:26:48 <ra7[m]> ahh. thats a mystery solved...
11:50:30 <sierocharlie[m]> Is it correct that once GrapheneOS boots it is encrypted (if encryption is enabled of course), and entering the password for the first time after boot causes it to decrypt. Similarly when using a high security set-up using multiple profiles switching to a profile and entering the password for that specific profile causes it to decrypt it. Ending the session of a profile causes it to encrypt again.
11:50:30 <sierocharlie[m]> It is my understanding that once the password is entered the mounted /data filesystem is decrypted and can thus be read.
11:51:22 <take_a_deep_brea> @sierocharlie: suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
11:51:59 <take_a_deep_brea> no one can answer you better than documentation : )
11:52:43 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: the data on storage is always encrypted
11:53:32 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: when you enter the lock method for a profile correctly for the 1st time since boot, the OS ends up with the main profile data encryption key, which remains available until 'end session' / reboot
11:54:07 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: there are auxilliary encryption keys which become at rest when the device is locked (such as keystore keys used by apps set to require that the device is unlocked)
11:59:22 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks. Your answer is much appreciated.
11:59:59 <sierocharlie[m]> I already read through the encryption faq multiple times but it didn't become clear to me if data is still encrypted while the profile is active.
12:00:22 <take_a_deep_brea> i understand . wasnt aware of you having read .
12:00:57 <take_a_deep_brea> just happens all too often that people ask questions which are answered in the FAQ without them having come across the FAQ
12:01:07 <sierocharlie[m]> I also read through the Full-disk encryption bit on AOSP.
12:01:10 <sierocharlie[m]> Yeah, I get that.
12:11:25 <sierocharlie[m]> Just to make sure that I am getting it correctly. Once a user profile is unlocked using the lock method for the profile it is decrypted? And can thus be accessed until the profile is at rest (ending session / reboot).
12:11:25 <sierocharlie[m]> I am getting particularly confused by the following sentence: "Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile." Because it mentions decrypting data in the regular usage profile.
12:11:25 <sierocharlie[m]> I have my Phone set-up in a way that I have the owner profile solely for managing other profiles, a regular usage profile and a secondary usage profile. The latter one which is used to e.g. show identification/papers without using my regular use profile. As recommended per the FAQ.
12:13:52 <sierocharlie[m]> My main concern being whether the regular use profile can be accessed if not put at rest by authorities that have physical access.
12:16:36 <take_a_deep_brea> in that case use the high security setup suggested in the encryption section
12:19:41 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: even if the session isn't ended they would have to exploit the hardened OS or extract data from memory
12:19:51 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: and apps that care can keep data at rest when locked
12:20:09 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
12:21:11 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: the data on storage is *always* encrypted, that's never decrypted
12:21:27 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: when the profile is logged in, the OS has the main decryption key in memory
12:21:51 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: when the session is ended (either it hasn't been logged in or was ended) then the main decryption key isn't in memory (and there aren't apps running with data in memory etc.)
12:23:17 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: for high security setup our recommendation is using Owner profile to manage other users + handle minor tasks where you just need to log in quickly
12:23:29 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: and then use a secondary profile as your main regular usage profile
12:24:06 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: because then you can boot up / unlock the Owner profile without the encryption key for most of your data being available
12:24:14 <sierocharlie[m]> Right. I went even further and use owner profile solely to manage other users, and have a second regular use profile, and a 2nd regular use profile (third profile) for travel, showing papers, etc.
12:24:38 <sierocharlie[m]> In order to keep the owner profile clean, it doesn't have any significant security benefits.
12:24:46 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks. I will have to check what apps store data in memory while the profile is logged in. As that is the only risk factor. Glad to hear files and other data on storage is always encrypted. I appreciate both of your time to answer my questions.
12:25:13 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: the issue is that when the profile is logged in, but locked, the OS still has the encryption key for most data available
12:25:25 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: so if the OS is exploited, they can most (not all) of the profile's data
12:25:33 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: just not data that is kept at rest when locked via keystore
12:26:03 <strcat> sierocharlie[m]: that's why end session is useful, it kills all the processes for that profile + wipes profile's encryption key from memory
12:26:18 <strcat> so then even if the OS is exploited they can't get any of that profile's data
12:27:07 <sierocharlie[m]> <strcat "@sierocharlie: so if the OS is e"> I understand that risk. My threat model however doesn't include someone being able to exploit the OS itself. Taking into account the resources and skill available of my adversary and the hardening of GrapheneOS.
12:28:07 <mrbrownbadger[m]> strcat wouldn't shutting your phone down be faster if one have multiple users loged in?
12:31:05 <giffgaff[m]> Is it possible to pause Android OS updates.
12:31:37 <mrbrownbadger[m]> @sierocharlie: there are places where they will provide you with free accommodation until you decide to remember the password so it's probably better to keep your encrypted stuff in the clowd while crossing borders and your phone unlocked
12:33:05 <sierocharlie[m]> <mrbrownbadger[m] "@sierocharlie: there are places "> Your right. However I don't travel to countries that can force me upon such accommodation.
12:36:15 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: it's GrapheneOS with our update app + server not Android
12:36:22 <strcat[m]> giffgaff: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
12:36:43 <strcat[m]> there isn't a standard AOSP update app
12:37:10 <giffgaff[m]> OK thanks for the information
12:51:10 <sierocharlie[m]> I was asking myself this question earlier. How long does it roughly take for a major AOSP release to be implemented in GrapheneOS? For example Android 12. Of course we don't yet know what exact changes it will bring and the amount of work required (although we will soon). Historically speaking then, how long did implementation roughly take?
12:52:01 <strcat[m]> < 1 month
12:52:04 <strcat[m]> with a massive amount of effort
12:52:08 <strcat[m]> generally ~2 weeks
12:52:21 <strcat[m]> working 100 hours / week with lots of help from multiple others
12:52:35 <strcat[m]> could go look at the Android 11 GrapheneOS release announcements
12:52:44 <strcat[m]> we try to prepare as best we can throughout the year
12:52:58 <strcat[m]> if we had early access to the development release sources it would be much easier without all that sudden time pressure
12:53:24 <strcat> we need as much help with it as possible
12:53:27 <strcat> need a *lot* of help
12:53:45 <strcat> porting android-prepare-vendor can also start with the developer previews, it should already be largely ported by the time the release comes out
12:54:07 <sierocharlie[m]> The effort is much appreciated. I wish I could contribute in a substantial way. Maybe I should do something about that when I have more time on my hands to get back into coding.
12:54:08 <strcat> and it's good to check out what is available via master / preview tags even though most sources aren't published til the public release
12:54:21 <strcat> it's a huge undertaking
12:54:30 <strcat> the more stuff we change, the more work it will be to preserve
12:54:43 <strcat> lately we haven't had time to land features upstream
12:54:51 <strcat> which is helpful for having less to port
13:19:41 <xx> is there a chance in the near future to expand supported devices to other than pixel devices?
13:29:07 <strcat> xx: not in the near future since making a secure device meeting the requirements is a substantial undertaking
13:29:15 <strcat> the docs cover this
13:29:25 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
13:29:41 <strcat> lots of further information available on the @GrapheneOS Twitter account and elsewhere too
13:30:17 <xx> strcat: oh my bad didn't check the docs.. thanks alot
13:30:42 <somenerd[m]> available on logbot as well
13:31:59 <somenerd[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
13:34:35 <fakhx[m]> is there a way to get vanadium to delete data (history/cookies/..) on closure ? like tor for example
13:47:49 <carbonatom[m]> You can use incognito mode, than just click close all tabs in the notifications.
13:56:08 <Guest77328> Hi, can anyone help me with volte and vowifi. I am using the French carrier SFR and would need the two features. Will it work? Not long ago, I put my sim card in an android 10 smartphone, and volte and vowifi worked immediatly. I use iOS right now but like to switch to a Pixel 4a with GrapheneOS, as long as volte and vowifi work
14:00:04 <mynacol[m]> Guest77328: Only someone on the same mobile network may answer your question correctly.
14:00:42 <mynacol[m]> Is this feature a necessity for you? Normally, you can write SMS and telephone quite fine over 3G/2G
14:01:16 <Guest77328> Yes LTE works best in my region for calls
14:01:55 <mynacol[m]> The general belief is that except for US carriers, most network operators get their stuff together and at least VoLTE should work
14:02:08 <mynacol[m]> But again, I cannot confirm
14:03:22 <Guest77328> I remember years ago when  I was using android, volte and vowifi was a pain to get worked, you needed an android image from your carrier... I was surprised as it just worked in a unlocked android 10 device
14:05:18 <Guest77328> I think this point gets important as 2G/3G will get shut off (well not in Europe afaik)
14:08:26 <sierocharlie[m]> I fail to disable the touch vibrations on the lockscreen when entering a pincode. This could help guess the lenght of my pin. How can I disable this? I have touch vibrations disabled in the soundsettings.
14:10:30 <sierocharlie[m]> Same for the sound when you lock the screen using the powerbutton. It does that even though the lockscreen sound is disabled under sound settings...
14:10:41 <sierocharlie[m]> This may be an issue with AOSP itself
14:14:25 <mynacol[m]> Guest77328: In fact you do not really depend on VoLTE. With a high probability it will work (still high but somehow lower probability for VoWiFi). If not, you can use 2G/3G and slowly move converstaions to another medium (as traditional telephony is insecure by design)
14:15:12 <Guest77328> absolutely, I'm using Signal and just left with normal calling for landline numbers
14:17:36 <Guest77328> btw, the day Apple or Google removes Signal from their App store (as we saw it with parler...), android based systems will be better of because I can just install the apk right? Or could they use other method to make the app not work anymore?
14:18:23 <sierocharlie[m]> You'll be able to install the APK. As for GrapheneOS, you'll be installing the APK anyways because it has no built in appstore.
14:19:12 <Guest77328> That is my reason I want to switch to GrapheneOS... I'm sick of Silicon Valley spying on us and in addition deciding what we can use or not...
14:20:39 <big_brother[m]> i tried web install of graphene again failed, not sure why, its my 3rd day trying, can anyone help me out to get this installation done
14:20:54 * big_brother[m] uploaded an image: graphene 7.png (50KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/FLAIITiuGuZtSlQqpkJOjAGE/graphene 7.png >
14:21:55 <sierocharlie[m]> I can't help you with this, but I am sure others will be able. Alternatively you could try to install graphene using the CLI.
14:21:56 <Guest77328> mynacol[m]let's say it doesn't work, will it be possible for me to contribute in making ot work (no programming skills except some basic python)? Or is it more complicated?
14:22:17 <Guest77328> talking about volte and vowifi of course
14:23:17 <big_brother[m]> <sierocharlie[m] "I can't help you with this, but "> i tried with CLI that gets stuck too, after installation midway it will give this message **waiting for any device** and boot into graphene fastbootd
14:24:12 <sierocharlie[m]> I am not sure. I have only installed GrapheneOS once, and it worked on the first try within minutes.
14:24:18 <sierocharlie[m]> What device are you trying to install on?
14:24:19 <big_brother[m]> between i am on arch linux
14:24:45 <big_brother[m]> pixel 3a sargo
14:25:22 <sierocharlie[m]> I don't want to give you advise at it could cause irreversible damage to your device. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will chime in. :)
14:25:55 <big_brother[m]> <sierocharlie[m] "I don't want to give you advise "> Thank you, if you have any you can still give, i rather take all help i can get, trying for past 3 days,
14:26:52 <sierocharlie[m]> It should be pretty straightforward if you follow all the steps. Confirm you have unlocked the boatloader?
14:27:14 <big_brother[m]> sure all steps, even verified the download
14:27:35 <big_brother[m]> pixel updated to latest version, fastboot latest version, pc all updated before starting
14:27:37 <sierocharlie[m]> In adb, what happens if you type "list devices"?
14:28:16 <big_brother[m]> before it listed my device and aske to confirm to connect, now only fastboot devices lists the device, adb command does not show any device
14:28:46 <big_brother[m]> right now i can only navigate bootloader and graphene recovery interface
14:29:02 <ewzyk[m]> have you tried running fastboot with sudo?
14:30:12 <big_brother[m]> <ewzyk[m] "have you tried running fastboot "> no not yet, but i did try running the scrip with and without sudo, thought it could be unix permission error but still same output, runs all the way upto here, from CLI, i will attach screenshot now
14:30:20 <StVM[m]> You already install android-udev right?
14:30:26 * big_brother[m] uploaded an image: graphene 6.png (51KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pUzKaWmGubBLamzuUcusvLRa/graphene 6.png >
14:30:37 <big_brother[m]> <StVM[m] "You already install android-udev"> yes done its installed
14:31:33 <mynacol[m]> Guest77328: strcat did copy most of the stock android configuration stuff, so VoLTE and VoWiFi should work for all carriers that 1) support it in the first place 2) do not need a proprietary system app with lots of permissions.
14:31:33 <mynacol[m]> For 1) we can't do anything and for 2) most notably US carriers are doing this, so you should be fine. Graphene won't include such apps.
14:31:33 <mynacol[m]> Maybe your carrier does support VoLTE and does not need said apps. Then you could help us with testing
14:31:43 <big_brother[m]> above is CLI installation, something goes off after vbmeta , and you see shows waiting for any device
14:33:33 <Guest77328> mynacol[m]: that sounds good because both volte and vowifi worked with a carrier independant android 10 smartphone (from German manufacturer Gigaset)
14:33:38 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you're messing it up by using adb, you are not supposed to use adb
14:33:39 <big_brother[m]> is there anyway i can flash the stock back and retry or some solution, if someone can point it out? as i dont think device is bricked
14:33:58 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you aren't following the official instructions
14:34:00 <strcat[m]> big_brother: that's your issue
14:34:07 <strcat[m]> you followed some broken third party instructions
14:34:25 <strcat[m]> reboot your computer and then use the web install without doing anything not in the guide
14:34:26 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "big_brother: you're messing it u"> ok thanks for pointing out so what can i do to recorrect it?
14:34:34 <strcat[m]> big_brother: reboot, then follow web install
14:34:34 <sierocharlie[m]> That's what I said. If you're following the installation guide by the book it should work and be pretty straightforward.
14:35:04 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "big_brother: reboot, then follow"> ok thanks i tried 2 times web install today it failed, but yes i did not reboot pc yet
14:35:06 <strcat[m]> big_brother: reboot the phone to bootloader interface (even if it's already there, restart the bootloader interface, there's an option to do it) and reboot your computer
14:35:08 <strcat[m]> then open web install
14:35:18 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you have adb running as a service, that's the issue
14:35:20 <strcat[m]> reboot your computer
14:35:33 <strcat[m]> (or kill adb and restart your browser but it's easier to say to reboot)
14:35:43 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "big_brother: you have adb runnin"> got it, i will remove android-tools and try with web install thank you
14:36:22 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you should have android-udev installed, it doesn't matter if you have android-tools
14:36:31 <strcat[m]> big_brother: the issue is you must have followed some unofficial guide
14:36:40 <strcat[m]> and did stuff you weren't supposed to
14:36:43 <strcat[m]> don't know exactly what you did
14:37:00 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "big_brother: the issue is you mu"> android-udev is installed
14:37:17 <big_brother[m]> thanks i will try now and update here, appreciate all the help
14:37:18 <strcat[m]> just reboot both computer + phone and do web install
14:37:36 <Guest77328> mynacol[m]: before flashing GrapheneOS, is there anything I could check/extract from stock android 11 regarding volte and vowifi which can help you afterwards?
14:37:45 <big_brother[m]> 🙂
14:39:07 <mynacol[m]> Guest77328: Well, you can test if it is available and works. Meaning SMS and telephony in both directions. And for VoLTE (check if actually LTE is being used) and VoWiFi separately.
14:40:03 <mynacol[m]> BTW I am not a dev on this project, just helping people out on this chat
14:43:34 <strcat[m]> VoWiFi, VoLTE and SMS over LTE are working well on carriers supporting them without proprietary apps
14:43:38 <strcat[m]> don't really need help with it
14:43:55 <strcat[m]> we're purposely not including extended carrier configs for some carriers due to proprietary app dependencies
14:43:57 <strcat[m]> which we won't include
14:43:59 <strcat[m]> so, deal with it
14:46:09 <mynacol[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: So there is no chance for some configs not copied although an app dependency is not needed?

14:49:47 <mynacol[m]> big_brother: didn't you reboot the PC like 10 minutes ago?
14:50:25 <big_brother[m]> <mynacol[m] "big_brother: didn't you reboot t"> just removed the android tools and restarted browser did not reboot, i will do now, once and check if it works with reboot
14:51:11 <mynacol[m]> Could be a problem with USB. Some people have had success with disconnecting and reconnecting the device at the right time. Not recommended tho
14:51:35 <big_brother[m]> <mynacol[m] "Could be a problem with USB. Som"> its the stock cable, works fine though
14:51:50 <strcat[m]> big_brother: it sounds like you're opening the page multiple times, or running adb
14:52:05 <mynacol[m]> big_brother: May be the USB port or chipset as well.
14:52:08 <strcat[m]> big_brother: close the brother, open it again, you shouldn't be trying to use this from multiple pages
14:52:19 <strcat[m]> big_brother: and you shouldn't be refreshing and then starting it again
14:52:35 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you're doing something that is claiming the interface from elsewhere
14:52:36 <mynacol[m]> Please re-read the install instructions as well.
14:52:43 <strcat[m]> you are running adb, or fastboot, or multiple copies of the page
14:52:51 <strcat[m]> close the browser, reopen it

15:09:18 <strcat[m]> the Owner profile is secure and it's not trusted beyond managing some global settings and managing user creation/deletion, etc.
15:09:20 <zvl12[m]> > <@freenode_strcat:matrix.org> so then even if the OS is exploited they can't get any of that profile's data
15:09:20 <zvl12[m]>  * In simple words, if I understood all good : Main profile : just a lobby/entry : do not keep nothing important here, keep in mind "everyone could visit", and in the 2 nd user profile : that's your fully private room, do all there, and in case of "emergency" press [End Session]... you will be back to the main lobby and private room will be cleaned..
15:09:30 <strcat[m]> you're making this really odd analogy
15:09:36 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's helpful at all
15:10:07 <strcat[m]> the reason that using another profile as the main one is useful is because the Owner profile has to be logged in before using other profiles
15:10:12 <strcat[m]> that's all
15:10:26 <strcat[m]> due to the Owner profile storing encrypted data for the overall system
15:10:27 <zvl12[m]> <strcat[m] "the Owner profile is secure and "> yes, but in case phone is seized, keys are in active memory ? at least i understood it this way
15:10:32 <strcat[m]> covered by https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
15:10:45 <strcat[m]> zvl12: only for logged in profiles
15:10:49 <strcat[m]> regardless of which profile it is
15:10:57 <sierocharlie[m]> <zvl12[m] "yes, but in case phone is seized"> Correct. But the memory can in turn only be exploited when the OS itself is exploited.
15:11:07 <strcat[m]> and as I said before apps can keep data at rest when the profile is logged in but the screen is locked
15:11:10 <strcat[m]> but they have to choose to do that
15:11:22 <sierocharlie[m]> Does you happen to know if Signal does that?
15:11:45 <strcat[m]> it's halfway to implementing it but doesn't largely because they seem to dislike the idea of doing it
15:11:56 <sierocharlie[m]> That's so stupid
15:12:18 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: they use keystore key to encrypt a key which is used to encrypt their database
15:12:46 <sierocharlie[m]> So the data in memory is already encrypted?
15:13:10 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: no what I mean is they use keystore to add a 2nd layer of encryption for their database
15:13:19 <sierocharlie[m]> But it should still be kept out of memory. In Iphones the FBI was even able to extract messages from the memory.
15:13:30 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: so, what they could do is call setUnlockedDeviceRequired on their keystore key and then the keystore could keep that key at rest when locked
15:13:36 <strcat[m]> that's step 1
15:13:39 <zvl12[m]> <strcat[m] "due to the Owner profile storing"> I understand, my mistake : I am taking into account my security threat model : phone seized at border and forced to handle password over : this is why the End Session of the 2 nd user is fantastic in my model .... one touch, even without unlocking the phone, and i am back in the main profile
15:13:43 <strcat[m]> step 2 is they could restart their app process
15:13:46 <strcat[m]> when the device gets locked
15:13:49 <strcat[m]> to purge the sensitive data
15:14:29 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: there would need to be a change to the semantics: when the device is locked, it could only notify that messages are available, it wouldn't know who sent them / what they are
15:15:02 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: when you unlocked it'd be able to access db again and then make the actual notifications
15:15:11 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: so it'd be a very slightly noticeable thing
15:15:53 <sierocharlie[m]> But a major improvement for security.
15:16:18 <sierocharlie[m]> Because otherwise even though you use Signal your messages could still be compromised when someone has physical access.
15:17:01 <sierocharlie[m]> They should make it an option, with the default set to on. Because I am sure some people will start complaining about it.
15:17:38 <zvl12[m]> I have a doubt if on the first phone i installed GOD I did Lock the Bootloader at the end of the process : can I go back into boot mode and check this ?
15:17:48 <zvl12[m]>  * I have a doubt if on the first phone i installed GOS I did Lock the Bootloader at the end of the process : can I go back into boot mode and check this ?
15:18:24 <strcat[m]> zvl12: it tells you every boot
15:18:25 <strcat[m]> if it's locked
15:18:37 <strcat[m]> if it's locked it tells you an alternate OS is installed
15:18:45 <strcat[m]> if it's not locked, it tells you it's unable to verify the OS due to being unlocked
15:19:07 <strcat[m]> zvl12: but sure you could boot into the bootloader interface to see it there
15:19:15 <strcat[m]> or you could use Auditor as recommended by our post-install guide
15:21:05 <zvl12[m]> <strcat[m] "if it's locked it tells you an a"> Indeed, its telling your device is loading a different OS, so I'm good..thanks
15:23:01 <strcat[m]> zvl12: use Auditor to check
15:23:18 <strcat[m]> will use hardware-based verification that you're running genuine GrapheneOS with verified boot working
15:26:54 <big_brother[m]> ok i tried everything fresh, now says **Error: The device must be opened first.
15:26:54 <big_brother[m]> ** but the device state is unlocked, any pointers please? its web install
15:28:11 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you need to have the device booted into the bootloader interface
15:28:15 <strcat[m]> restart the bootloader interface again
15:28:19 <strcat[m]> restart your computer again
15:28:23 <strcat[m]> something is wrong with your setup
15:28:35 <strcat[m]> don't think you'll be able to install without using a different computer / cable, something is very wrong
15:28:58 <strcat[m]> it should be as simple as connecting it and pressing a few buttons there
15:29:44 <big_brother[m]> interface shows Triangle and fastboot mode
15:30:17 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean by triangle
15:30:45 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to start in the bootloader menu not fastboot mode
15:31:17 <strcat[m]> big_brother: are you using the cable that comes with the device?
15:31:31 * big_brother[m] uploaded an image: jj.jpg (307KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/aZhZxvUEutUNqhdpttWhEkWO/jj.jpg >
15:31:43 <big_brother[m]> similar one , yes Sir, same cable
15:32:00 <big_brother[m]> its just sargo instead of bleline
15:34:54 <rhymes[m]> Hi, I have recently installed GOS, very impressed so far. I am trying to creates backups to a USB stick, however I only get the option to do so in the admin profile, not any of the other users. Does creating a backup in the admin profile backup the other users?
15:35:13 <rhymes[m]> I have had a look in the FAQ but couldn't see anything related
15:35:13 <strcat[m]> rhymes: Seedvault is the backup service implementation
15:35:17 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't yet support secondary users
15:35:28 <strcat[m]> it also doesn't yet backup the profile's home directory itself, just app data
15:35:38 <strcat[m]> (which includes contacts, etc.)
15:35:52 <strcat[m]> we don't develop it, we just include it
15:36:04 <strcat[m]> need to ask the Seedvault developers about it and report issues there
15:36:27 <rhymes[m]> OK, that's cool
15:36:42 <rhymes[m]> Thank you for all you're hard work
15:37:17 <rhymes[m]> * Thank you for all your hard work
15:41:01 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "restart the bootloader interface"> yes Sir, i must have done something wrong, should have gone with web install from beginning instead trying with CLI, thanks i will try again, and awesome project cant wait to get my device started
15:42:00 <strcat[m]> big_brother: do you have another computer you can install from?
15:42:17 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you can install from an Android device, it just takes a long time to do the extraction/flashing
15:42:45 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "big_brother: do you have another"> just one Sir, will try on friends one tomorrow , i have 3 phones, i can try it sure
15:43:32 <strcat[m]> big_brother: you can install from another phone
15:43:40 <strcat[m]> don't need to use another computer if you don't have one
15:43:49 <strcat[m]> connect the 2 phones together with one of the Pixel USB cables
15:43:57 <strcat[m]> and use web installer to flash it from another phone
15:44:13 <strcat[m]> it's just a bit annoying since you have to press reconnect after each reboot and select device again
15:46:52 <big_brother[m]> Thank you Sir, will try now, appreciate it a lot
15:49:37 <test_> :)
15:59:27 <strcat[m]> big_brother: also don't use incognito mode
15:59:53 <strcat[m]> big_brother: were you doing that?
15:59:54 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have enough space
16:02:41 <sierocharlie[m]> <strcat[m] "and it doesn't yet support secon"> Backups through adb will support secondary users right? Otherwise what are other possibilities to backup all profiles? Because that's quite important for me.
16:03:52 <strcat[m]> you can backup all their home directories in a straightforward way
16:04:02 <strcat[m]> Seedvault doesn't support multi-user yet afaik
16:04:05 <strcat[m]> need to bring that up with them
16:04:50 <somenerd[m]> wonder if Profiles could be integrated into the main profile UI or something
16:06:57 <sierocharlie[m]> I know it is outside of the scope of GOS, and that multi-user support should be brought up with Seedvault. Simply asking whether you know of alternatives to backup all user profiles, whether it be able to be restored within GOS or actually somehow clone the entire phone and restore that, which I don't think will work for a multitude of reasons, but anyway.
16:07:25 <big_brother[m]> <strcat[m] "it doesn't have enough space"> normal mode Sir, all stock settings,
16:08:18 <strcat[m]> it mostly needs to be addressed in Seedvault
16:09:03 <strcat[m]> it's missing 3 major things: backing up home directory, using the new feature of declaring it a secure backup so it bypasses apps that have normal backups disabled (they can still blacklist files) and multi-user support
16:09:17 <strcat[m]> can do home directory yourself but no way to work around the other 2 issues
16:09:25 <strcat[m]> has to be improved to deal with that
16:09:38 <sierocharlie[m]> Gotcha, will be opening issues with them to motivate.
16:09:40 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: I think there was a way to use adb backup
16:09:44 <strcat[m]> but I don't know if it still worksp
16:09:53 <sierocharlie[m]> Okay, will research it. Thanks!
16:09:56 <strcat[m]>  * but I don't know if it still works
17:01:20 <manjusri[m]> guys, I just got a brand new Pixel 3, I've started myself the first time, I've activated USB debugging, but I cannot activate OEM unlocking. Any ideas why would this be greyed out and how can I activate it? Thanks!
17:01:47 <sierocharlie[m]> Connect to the internet.
17:01:51 <alex-resist> manjusri do you have a working WiFi connection?
17:02:08 <manjusri[m]> yep, I do
17:02:10 <sierocharlie[m]> You need to connect it to the internet in order for it to become available.
17:02:14 <sierocharlie[m]> Then it should work.
17:02:53 <alex-resist> manjusri is your device Verizon branded?
17:03:13 <manjusri[m]> that simple? great, thank you! ok let me try
17:03:23 <sierocharlie[m]> Yeah, really that simple.
17:03:34 <sierocharlie[m]> Just connect it to the internet and it'll unlock.
17:05:46 <manjusri[m]> it's not Verizon, I'm in Europe, I think this phone comes from Germany
17:06:12 <sierocharlie[m]> He was asking because it could be a locked phone. But that is likely not the case.
17:06:20 <sierocharlie[m]> Just check if connecting works first.
17:06:31 <sierocharlie[m]> If not, there's other ways to go about unlocking I think.
17:09:53 <manjusri[m]> I'm connected to the internet, loaded a couple of pages in the browser just to be sure it's working, then checked OEM unlocking and it's still greyed out
17:10:10 <sierocharlie[m]> Try restarting once
17:10:15 <sierocharlie[m]> Should work afterwards
17:10:16 <manjusri[m]> ok
17:11:23 <manjusri[m]> no luck... it does say "connect to the internet or contact your carrier"
17:11:39 <sierocharlie[m]> Is your phone carrier locked?
17:11:40 <manjusri[m]> I have no idea if this was a carrier locked phone or not, I just got it from a guy who had a bunch of them
17:12:14 <manjusri[m]> so carrier locking is cannot be removed by restoring or completely wiping the phone
17:12:15 <manjusri[m]> ?
17:12:31 <manjusri[m]>  * so carrier locking cannot be removed by restoring or completely wiping the phone
17:12:31 <sierocharlie[m]> No.
17:12:36 <sierocharlie[m]> Have you updated the phone?
17:12:40 <mynacol[m]> manjusri: Maybe you have more luck asking the guy you bought from
17:12:41 <mynacol[m]> <manjusri[m] "so carrier locking is cannot be "> No
17:12:53 <sierocharlie[m]> Try updating it as well, before unlocking the OEM
17:12:58 <mynacol[m]> That would be idiotic
17:13:08 <sierocharlie[m]> <mynacol[m] "That would be idiotic"> ?
17:13:10 <manjusri[m]> it's on android 10 so I can update, yes
17:13:19 <sierocharlie[m]> You should update to 11 first.
17:13:39 <sierocharlie[m]> Fully update your phone first, connect it to the internet. And get back to use
17:13:39 <take_a_deep_brea> manjusri:  " Carrier variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including disabling carrier and bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier
17:13:40 <take_a_deep_brea> agnostic device to avoid the risk and potential hassle"
17:13:40 <take_a_deep_brea> this is from the web install page
17:13:43 <sierocharlie[m]> Us.*
17:13:58 <mynacol[m]> <mynacol[m] "That would be idiotic"> Sorry, about factory resetting removing the carrier lock
17:14:14 <sierocharlie[m]> Right.
17:14:53 <manjusri[m]> ok so basically I don't have any options?
17:15:18 <alex-resist> manjusri run all available updates, try again
17:15:37 <manjusri[m]> right, ok I'll do this then, thank you!
17:16:28 <strcat[m]> manjusri: by brand new do you mean you took it out of an unopened box? you should check the box to see if it's a carrier model
17:16:32 <alex-resist> manjusri I'm also in Germany, I've never seen Verizon locked phones here. Then again, people sometimes sell US variants on eBay (with different LTE bands etc.). Perhaps your middleman got several of those, that would be an extremely unlucky situation.
17:16:37 <strcat[m]> Verizon Pixels don't support unlocking
17:17:05 <strcat[m]> I mean any Pixel 3 being sold at this point that is 'new' makes me skeptical
17:17:07 <manjusri[m]> yeah, that's probably it, well I'll update and see
17:17:41 <manjusri[m]> it was actually exchanged in service for a broken one but I cannot say where did this one come from
17:19:55 <orangeguy[m]> Will GrapheneOS cause any issue for Android app development?
17:21:11 <strcat[m]> orangeguy: you'll need to clarify what you mean
17:22:29 <orangeguy[m]> is it impossible to use GFS based Android apps on GrapheneOS?
17:22:52 <strcat[m]> GFS?
17:25:18 <sierocharlie[m]> He means Google services
17:25:28 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe you meant GSF ?
17:25:34 <sierocharlie[m]> I bet he does
17:26:02 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services, so it's not available to apps
17:26:02 <zzxx123> Aurora Store call it GFS
17:26:17 <strcat[m]> doubt it
17:26:41 <strcat[m]> if an app has a hard dependency on Play services, then the functionality depending on it won't work, or the app as a whole if they don't have a fallback
17:26:49 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is Android compatible and apps support Android run fine on it
17:26:58 <strcat[m]> baseline Android doesn't not include Play services
17:27:12 <strcat[m]> it's not required to have full Android compatibility per Android's definition of that
17:27:24 <strcat[m]> so, if it's an Android app, it works on GrapheneOS
17:27:35 <strcat[m]> if it's an Android app that only works on devices with Play services, then no, it won't work
17:27:51 <zzxx123> A lot of apps indicated as GSF dependent on Aurora Stores work fine without Google services
17:28:06 <strcat[m]> no reason you can't do Android app development with GrapheneOS but if you want to use Play services for something when it's available you'll have to test that elsewhere
17:28:18 <strcat[m]> emulator works fine for most aspects of development regardless
17:28:54 <strcat[m]> zzxx123: including the Play services SDK doesn't mean the app has any mandatory dependency on it, or any missing functionality without it
17:28:59 <strcat[m]> zzxx123: up to the app developers how they use it
17:29:20 <strcat[m]> an app can use FCM for push when available and their own push otherwise, etc.
17:30:12 <zzxx123> They use it for tracking I guess?
17:30:41 <take_a_deep_brea> zzxx123:  tracking is a really vague word
17:30:44 <zzxx123> Even Google maps works
17:30:54 <strcat[m]> zzxx123: unclear what you mean by 'tracking' and no that's not what apps use Play services to do
17:31:20 <strcat[m]> it doesn't offer 'tracking' to app developers
17:31:26 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
17:31:48 <strcat[m]> zzxx123: Google Maps is one of the few Google apps that works at all without Play services
17:31:52 <strcat[m]> and it definitely doesn't fully work
17:31:55 <strcat[m]> some portions of it do
17:32:03 <strcat[m]> because they went out of the way to make it work for some reason
17:33:05 <strcat[m]> don't think this is a good topic for this channel beyond this
17:38:54 <zvl12[m]> is there a Maps app that is recommended/safe for GOS ?
17:39:16 <zvl12[m]>  * is there a Maps app that is recommended/safe for GOS ? (and has nothing to do with Google)
17:39:27 <alex-resist> zvl12 OsmAnd~ or Magic Earth should do the job
17:39:27 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of map apps
17:42:02 <sierocharlie[m]> manjusri:
17:42:12 <sierocharlie[m]>  * manjusri: Still updating?
17:48:37 <manjusri[m]> @sierocharlie: finished updating and the toggle is still greyed out. Though I'm using my own SIM in the phone and it works with my carrier called Orange, let me just try a SIM from another carrier, if that one works too I guess it's not carrier locking?
17:50:17 <manjusri[m]> yep, it does work with a sim from Vodafone. If I remember correctly, carrier locking would only allow the phone to work inside that network, correct?
17:50:29 <sierocharlie[m]> Correct.
17:51:01 <manjusri[m]> well than the problem is somewhere else
17:51:29 <zvl12[m]> <manjusri[m] "yep, it does work with a sim fro"> yes... they wont let you go on another network... usaully happens when you got the phone for cheap... they keep you jailed in their network
17:52:11 <manjusri[m]> right, so my memory still works. I haven't had locked phones in more than 10 years so wasn't sure
17:52:26 <sierocharlie[m]> manjusri: Remove SIM, factory reset, initiate setup enabling Wi-Fi, proceed to dev settings and check "Allow OEM unlocking". If you have completely wiped the phone and OEM unlocking is still greyed out, then your phone is bootloader locked and there is probably no workaround.
17:52:52 <manjusri[m]> ok thank you, I'll do that and report back in a bit
17:53:17 <sierocharlie[m]> 👍️ Make sure to enable wifi during the initial set-up after resrt
17:53:18 <sierocharlie[m]>  * 👍️ Make sure to enable wifi during the initial set-up after reset

17:53:36 <manjusri[m]> ok, got it
17:58:23 <phonehome[m]> hello.  i have a pixel 4a loaded with graphene os for about 4 months and i had a few questions if someone is open to helping me :-)
17:59:24 <sierocharlie[m]> Tell us your question.
18:00:28 <phonehome[m]> currently i have a very minimal setup.  grapheneos latest build, vanadium, sensors and privacy controls locked down.  i have a gsm sim in the united states that works really well but i don't use it exept for data.  i like to use signal for my friends and colleagues so that's working.  i built my own wireguard endpoint since the client seems to do a better job of full vpn with locking.
18:02:25 <phonehome[m]> here's my question(s).  there are a couple of vpns that i use for work and such that are still using openvpn (not happy about that). what client should i be using to ensure i can kill-switch the vpn so it doesn't leak?  secondly i really enjoy matrix, i there a recommended client for it?  third, i also run a small xmpp system so was wondering what is the gold standard for that.  and finally if i choose to use a sip
18:02:25 <phonehome[m]> service (because business), is there a recommended client that works well or am i better off with my own asterix for the sip trunk.
18:02:27 <phonehome[m]> thank you in advance :-)
18:02:28 <phonehome[m]> ps i hope everyone is having a nice day / afternoon
18:03:28 <sierocharlie[m]> <phonehome[m] "ps i hope everyone is having a n"> Likewise!
18:03:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hello phonehome[m], indeed, enjoying the day here, same to you! Unfortunately, stuff like that that's not specific to GrapheneOS is offtopic here.
18:04:37 <phonehome[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hello phonehome, indeed, enjoyin"> is there an offtopic room where i may echo the question?  or is someone willing to pm me so i don't clutter?  i'd like to respect the room :-)
18:05:19 <sierocharlie[m]> There's GrapheneOS Off Topic
18:05:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, there is an offtopic room, at #grapheneos-offtopic. Similar rules apply, but we allow discussion of other operating systems and apps there that aren't topical to GrapheneOS.
18:05:43 <TheJollyRoger> Since you're using Matrix, it looks like you'll be joining #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
18:07:10 <phonehome[m]> thank you jollyroger.  i admittedly have very poor eyesight so i didn't see the room topic :-)
18:07:13 <TheJollyRoger> If you're interested in VPNs and GrapheneOS, GrapheneOS actually has a way for you to add a VPN with "Always On VPN" toggled to on. Third party apps are not required.
18:07:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hey no problem!
18:07:43 <TheJollyRoger> Simply go to Settings -> Network & Internet -> Advanced -> VPN and tap the "+" to add another.
18:08:29 <Bret2021> on the pixel 5, is there a way to volunteer beta testing and such? or is it just a wait and see stance ?
18:08:32 <TheJollyRoger> Beyond this point, you'll need to work with your VPN provider to obtain all the right settings for authentication.
18:08:47 <phonehome[m]> no worries, i am for the most part my own vpn provider :-)
18:08:57 <sierocharlie[m]> <Bret2021 "on the pixel 5, is there a way t"> There's an experimental build over at https://grapheneos.org/releases#redfin-stable
18:09:05 <phonehome[m]> awesome, i'll try that jollyroger.  i was using the openvpn client from f-droid but i think it was having conflicts with the built in setup.
18:09:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Bret2021, for the Pixel 5, simply run Experimental. I have a beta-testing room at #grapheneos-beta, but that room is not used for chatting, I simply use it to ping other people of when beta updates are around and then pester them again to send in reports.
18:09:39 <TheJollyRoger> phonehome[m]: Indeed, it's best to use the operating system's built-in features where you can, since they will be able to do things that third-party apps are not allowed to do.
18:09:47 <Bret2021> ok good deal. I was curious about that.
18:10:24 <TheJollyRoger> Bret2021: Yep! It's important to, if you run the Beta, because we don't have telemetry/error reporting, you're going to have to report if stuff is working (or if stuff isn't) yourself, to the issue tracker.
18:10:30 <TheJollyRoger> So it is a bit of a commitment.
18:10:36 <TheJollyRoger> However it's a fairly minor one.
18:10:43 <NewPerson> Hey, I've just installed GrapheneOS. I'm new to all this but I can't get streaming video apps to play video - I've tried NewPipe and Lbry - they both open fine and let me run a search, but when I select a video instead of playing ti they just close the app. I've been through all the settings and googled this but I can't find a solution. I'm using a
18:10:43 <NewPerson> VPN but the problem persists even if I turn it off...
18:10:53 <phonehome[m]> <TheJollyRoger "phonehome: Indeed, it's best to "> i agree.  the only thing tcp/ip/vpn i have to deal with is wireguard.  i have my own mesh network for assets then another one for casual surfing.  the 3rd-party client works pretty well
18:11:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy NewPerson, I haven't run either of those apps, but a few of ours do. Stick around here and let's see if anyone else pipes up.
18:12:11 <NewPerson> Thanks! Is there anything in particular I should be doing to enable streaming video?
18:12:29 <sierocharlie[m]> Should work out of the box, at least it did for me.
18:12:34 <phonehome[m]> NewPerson: i'm watching this one too.  i don't use lbry but i do enjoy watching a video as privately as i can :-)
18:12:54 <catfish[m]> NewPerson what versions and where from? The latest fdroid lbry is not working
18:13:03 <TheJollyRoger> NewPerson: Not that I can recall. I can access YouTube and other video streaming sites through both Vanadium and Tor Browser and they play fine, when YouTube doesn't flag Tor exit IP addresses as "suspicious activity."
18:13:20 <NewPerson> ah, I got lbry from fdroid, maybe that's the problem
18:13:29 <phonehome[m]> 🤣 god bless tor
18:13:42 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, indeed!
18:14:50 <TheJollyRoger> Bret2021: if you're interested in Redfin (Pixel 5), then I wholeheartedly encourage you to pick it up and give it a try, we need people sending in "Yes, all is working." or "Nope, this is broken, here's detailed instructions on how I can reproduce the breakage..."
18:15:56 <TheJollyRoger> The idea being, that experimental builds need to get tested "in the wild" before they can be marked as beta, and then from there, marked as stable.
18:16:35 <Bret2021> im actually reading up on the install procedure right now. I have the 5 and looking to run grapheneos
18:17:07 <TheJollyRoger> Fantastic. If you run into difficulty, ping me.
18:17:21 <Bret2021> I sure will. just report issues here, if any?
18:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> Bret2021: the best way to report issues, is actually on the issue tracker, let me go dig it up...
18:18:07 <catfish[m]> NewPerson uninstall and get the apk from their website
18:18:46 <yellinstuff> hi all, I'm getting an error "Error: undefined" when web flashing. Anyone know how I can get more info on the error?
18:19:16 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues Bret2021 , here's the issue tracker. The important thing to note is to only report issues that weren't previously broken before. Since there aren't previous builds of Pixel 5, you may need to search the Issue tracker to ensure you aren't making a duplicate
18:19:24 <TheJollyRoger> yellinstuff: are you in Incognito mode in your browser?
18:19:49 <TheJollyRoger> Error: Undefined happens when the browser starts clearing out the cache before Fastboot is finished working with it.
18:19:50 <Bret2021> thanks !
18:20:14 <yellinstuff> Yup I'm using a guest session. I'll get out of that, thanks!
18:20:22 <TheJollyRoger> yellinstuff: yep! Hopefully this should fix it for you.
18:22:55 <TheJollyRoger> yellinstuff: I believe this may be because the download is roughly eight or nine hundred megabytes or so, and then usually Edge or Chrome/Chromium starts assuming that nobody needs that much space for a private session and then just starts ditching the downloaded files before fastboot.js can finish its good work.
18:24:44 <TheJollyRoger> Bret2021: good luck on the Pixel 5! I hear that phone was very well-recieved, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous.
18:27:43 <Bret2021> i love the size and weight, wish it was a bit higher end specs, but its nice. Its what the pixel should have been 3 years ago honestly
18:29:16 <carbonatom[m]> I got 4a, the only phone with a reasonable price/value ratio.
18:29:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I got the impression that the P4 was Google's attempt to make the iAndroid, but they forgot that people who want iPhones will buy iPhones, and people who want Android devices will buy Android devices, and ended up pleasing neither camp with it, so they're going back to what people bought Pixels for.
18:29:46 <phonehome[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. I got the impression that "> i miss the headphone jack myself.  but not the end of the world
18:29:56 <manjusri[m]> @sierocharlie:  I've done a couple of factory resets, both from the settings app and from the recovery screen, enabled wifi during setup, and I still have the OEM unlocking greyed out. After searching a bit online I found that by doing a simple search in Chrome (from the phone) I can see the client param and on this device it says: client=ms-android-verizon
18:29:56 <manjusri[m]>  so as you guys suspected, and weird enough verizon devices do reach Europe and are sold around. Now I guess OEM unlocking is only something that Verizon can do ... but the question is, how come I can use two different SIM cards in the phone, from two different carriers and none of them is Verizon, as Verizon is not present in Europe.
18:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> The last $200 from the 4 to 5, or the $500 from the 4 to 4a adds up fast.
18:31:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hello manjusri[m], sheesh, sorry to hear you ended up getting stuck with that.
18:31:41 <alex-resist> manjusri always be skeptical of middlemen, that are selling a bunch of phones for cheap
18:31:48 <manjusri[m]> sometimes we learn the hard way :)
18:32:06 <TheJollyRoger> manjusri[m]: the reason you can use different SIM cards in your phone, while it cannot be bootloader unlocked, is because that phone is likely bootloader locked while being carrier unlocked
18:32:21 <TheJollyRoger> The easiest way to find out is to use ADB to return the  ro.boot.cid property.
18:32:31 <TheJollyRoger> I'm guessing it's "00000001"
18:32:31 <manjusri[m]> I can check that
18:33:07 <TheJollyRoger> the command sequence should be "adb shell getprop ro.boot. cid"
18:33:11 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, sorry
18:33:14 <TheJollyRoger> Belay my last
18:33:17 <TheJollyRoger> the command sequence should be "adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid"
18:33:20 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, superfluous space there.
18:34:13 <manjusri[m]> yep you were right, the returned value is: 00000001
18:34:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... tough luck :(. This phone cannot be unlocked.
18:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> I think what happens...
18:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> What happens is that the kids being paid eight bucks an hour to sling the phones all chuck them in the same bin.
18:35:11 <TheJollyRoger> They don't know there's a difference between carrier locked, bootloader locked, and carrier locked bootloader locked phones.
18:36:28 <manjusri[m]> I see, ok great, thank you for your patience and for helping me figure this out. I'll just have to search for another one and give this one to whomever wants to use it with ... Google's stuff :)
18:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense, good luck man!
18:36:47 <manjusri[m]> cheers!
18:56:58 <patlastname[m]> Heyo, dumb question but is Minecraft possible on grapheneos? I installed using Aurora store and keep getting a license error
18:57:59 <yellinstuff> TheJollyRoger my install was successful, thanks again! FYI my device is Pixel 3 XL

19:04:13 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: it sounds like you didn't do a clean build
19:04:20 <strcat[m]> you did an incremental build with your existing out/ directory
19:04:36 <strcat[m]> for a production release you really need to run `repo status` to make sure you don't have unclean changes in repositories and then `rm -rf out/`
19:05:00 <strcat[m]> if you build from an existing build then it's not going to change the build number / build date
19:05:07 <strcat[m]> and while MOST changes can be picked up from incremental builds not all can
19:05:32 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend against using incremental builds for production in general not specific to AOSP
19:06:12 <patlastname[m]> Sooooo nobody knows bout the Minecraft thin then?
19:07:15 <cx7dd[m]> I did remove the out directory.
19:08:36 <cx7dd[m]> repo status reports the 3 ChromeApks and the Updater config
19:11:51 <dnull> patlastname[m]: Probably requires google play services
19:12:22 <patlastname[m]> <dnull "patlastname: Probably requires g"> Any way around it?
19:13:19 <dnull> Other than installing gps? Probably not.
19:14:13 <patlastname[m]> What about microg?
19:14:22 <dnull> No clue

19:17:06 <dnull> Doubtful
19:17:44 <patlastname[m]> Fek
19:50:31 <cx7dd[m]> <strcat[m] "cx7dd: it sounds like you didn't"> Does a clean build mean that I have to redownload all this repo stuff? :/

20:10:39 <cx7dd[m]> If I do "repo init -u https:/... -b refs/tags/<full string>"
20:10:39 <cx7dd[m]> Then "repo sync"

20:52:22 <mynacol[m]> uperptamwezg091: Probably not better than just unlocking the device normally and flashing Graphene. The OEM AVB keys are inside of the SoC, so no, you won't modify them.
20:53:07 <uperptamwezg091[> thanks! good to know
21:18:38 <mike23> trying to get grapheneos on a pixel 3axl.  recently used on verizon.  i currently have a mint mobile sim in it.  works fine, verizon says its unlocked and i assume it is since the mint mobile works.  problem - when i boot to bootloader screen it says the device is locked and the web install seems to say the same,  can the phone be unlocked and
21:18:39 <mike23> yet the bootloader locked? sorry, but i'm new to this
21:19:17 <nscnt[m]> mike23: Were you able to enable OEM unlocking?
21:19:46 <mike23> where would i do this?
21:20:59 <nscnt[m]> mike23: That's one of the first steps you need to do (take a look at one of the *official* guides) and if you're able to do it, you're good to flash GrapheneOS.
21:21:09 <grapheneos_user_> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#enabling-oem-unlocking
21:21:40 <nscnt[m]> We recommend the WebUSB-based installer for most users, though.
21:22:33 <grapheneos_user_> <mike23 "where would i do this?"> Do not use third party guides, especially not techlore's. Also, the official guide has everything, so please only post here if something went wrong when you followed it.
21:22:39 <grapheneos_user_> <nscnt[m] "We recommend the WebUSB-based in"> Yes
21:23:32 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "Do not use third party guides, e"> Not that its bad to ask, but its more efficient for everyone if people read first before asking questions, to minimize wasted mental effort
21:24:35 <mike23> Trying, but when I press "build number" I get nothing
21:24:53 <grapheneos_user_> <mike23 "Trying, but when I press "build "> Ohhh I see. You have to spam it.
21:25:51 <mike23> spam it ?
21:26:32 <grapheneos_user_> <mike23 "spam it ?"> Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
21:26:36 <sierocharlie[m]> Press it often
21:26:51 <sierocharlie[m]> Press build number at least 30 times or something
21:27:11 <grapheneos_user_> <sierocharlie[m] "Press build number at least 30 t"> Yes but in quick succession
21:27:23 <sierocharlie[m]> It eventually will say press x more times to become developer
21:27:36 <sierocharlie[m]> Just keep pressing it until it says "You're now a developer!"
21:28:05 <mike23> I am now a developer. do i need to reboot or do anything else before going back to the web install, thanks
21:28:55 <grapheneos_user_> <mike23 "I am now a developer. do i need "> Nope, but make sure you have a backup as the installation wipes all data
21:28:57 <sierocharlie[m]> Dude
21:29:04 <sierocharlie[m]> Read the freaking installation guide
21:29:13 <grapheneos_user_> <sierocharlie[m] "Read the freaking installation g"> Yes
21:29:32 <sierocharlie[m]> Seriously though. All the steps are literally outlined there. You're literally asking us everything that's outlined in the web install.
21:29:52 <sierocharlie[m]> Just follow it sentence by sentence. It is the best way to do it.
21:47:59 <xfil> grapheneos_user_: what kind of horrible irc client are you using
21:48:14 <xfil> oh it's matrix
21:48:27 <xfil> no wonder

21:53:55 <Guest40022> Trying to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 2, but keep getting an out of date fastboot message when I try to run the flash-all.bat. Fasboot is latest, drivers are latest, and phone OS is latest available for that device.
22:01:12 <grapheneos_user_> Bruh if you're gonna ask a question, don't leave the room before it is answered
22:01:25 <grapheneos_user_> Why even ask it then lol
22:11:37 <NonServiam> Moved back over to GrapheneOS from another alternative. Is there any harm in me opting into the beta release updates?
22:16:55 <grapheneos_user_> <NonServiam "Moved back over to GrapheneOS fr"> The occasional bug, but as long as you back up there is no risk
22:17:22 <grapheneos_user_> Though, if lives or anything important depend on the security, use the stable channel.
22:17:54 <grapheneos_user_> Otherwise use beta, as that is an easy way to contribute to Grapheneos.
22:23:44 <fast1[m]> Is it possible to end the session of the owner profile so no apps run in the background?
22:24:41 <sierocharlie[m]> No
22:25:46 <sierocharlie[m]> In a high security set-up you shouldn't be using the Owner profile anyways except for managing other user profiles.

23:03:11 <Bret2021> im working on trying to use experimental on pixel 5. I cant seem to use flash-all like usual, it wont proceed, so Im using the web install, wont recognize phone. I sthere something im missing?
23:05:46 <codebam> big thank you to whoever got graphene working on the pixel 5!
23:07:20 <Bret2021> how did ya get it installed?
23:09:02 <Bret2021> i can t seem to load it.
23:15:43 <brenneke[m]> See Auditor is now at 25, I still have 23 on updated 4a.
23:15:43 <brenneke[m]> Do I wait for next monthly update or is there another recommended way?
23:15:43 <brenneke[m]> Seem to remember getting Auditor updates in the past from Aurora but none now.
23:17:13 <owcnthe2947[m]> Graphene as a template for Qubes when? That would be amazing for security and privacy. Even heard it was sort of planned for a while.
23:18:18 <zvl12[m]> <Bret2021 "im working on trying to use expe"> not every usb cable will work... try changing to eliminate this already
23:19:17 <codebam> how can I install gcam?
23:24:31 <super_noob[m]> Big thanks to the  Discord  group for helping me get GrapheneOS set up  on my 3 XL.  The Discord gang  suggested my USB-C port wasn't  up  to snuff  and that's what it was. I my my friend's  laptop, and G loaded effortlessly.   Just have  a  few  questions to make sure it's running correctly.  When I  start up the phone, I  get "Your  device is loading a different operating system. Visit this link on another
23:24:31 <super_noob[m]> device." and then a " Google"  splash page. And then the graphene OS Splash page. Pics (https://imgur.com/a/pS8tL1i) Is this normal  for a  flashed  ROM?
23:24:58 <super_noob[m]> ***I used  my friends laptop...
23:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hello super_noob[m] yes, that's entirely normal and expected behaviour.
23:28:04 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hello super_noob yes, that's ent"> Thank you  JR.
23:28:26 <TheJollyRoger> The yellow screen simply means "Your operating system has been signed by and verified to someone that's not Google, but it's still signed and verified."
23:28:47 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: it's only if that screen turns orange and gives you some ominous warning about "Software integrity is not guaranteed! Don't use this device" do you need to worry.
23:29:02 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The yellow screen simply means ""> Awesome,  thank you. That takes a load off  my mind.
23:29:04 <TheJollyRoger> Since that means you've unlocked the bootloader,
23:29:19 <TheJollyRoger> but that should not happen unless you plug the phone back in, start fastboot and unlock her again!
23:30:08 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: if you want to update Auditor, you can download it direct from Github, actually. That's the recommended way. It's signed and verifiedand preauthenticated: GrapheneOS will not allow you to install counterfeit versions of Auditor.
23:30:14 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "super_noob: it's only if that sc"> Thanks for the heads-u[p
23:30:50 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: yep, anytime!
23:32:31 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: to prevent unlocking of the bootloader without either a factory reset or the password, you can reopen developer options, slide "OEM Unlocking Enabled" to "Off" and then switch developer options back off again.
23:35:14 <TheJollyRoger> codebam: I don't think you can install GCam anymore. In the past, there was an exception in the security policy that allowed it to run, but that exception could be removed in the future.
23:36:24 <sphinxcat[m]> super_noob: this is a Matrix room, not a 'Discord group' FYI
23:36:28 <codebam> oh okay I see
23:36:36 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "super_noob: to prevent unlocking"> Done, thank you.
23:36:46 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: Awesome. Welcome aboard the ship!
23:37:39 <super_noob[m]> <sphinxcat[m] "super_noob: this is a Matrix roo"> Oh my, please forgive  the blooper.
23:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Bret2021, Welcome back. You're having problems installing with the web install?
23:38:07 <TheJollyRoger> super_noob[m]: hahaha, had me confused a moment too because I was like "Hey wait when did we get a Discord group?"
23:39:05 <super_noob[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi Bret2021, Welcome back. You'r"> No, I have discord up on a different tab.
23:39:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, well fancy that.
23:39:46 <Bret2021> I am, I tried chrome and edge, no recognition of phone.
23:40:24 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. How strange. Does it recognize other devices?
