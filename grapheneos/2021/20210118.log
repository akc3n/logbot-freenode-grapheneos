00:01:33 <snooopy> which fastboot version do you usa?
00:01:41 <snooopy> fastboot --version
00:06:28 <penguin1> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
00:06:28 <penguin1> Installed as C:\Android\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
00:08:06 <snooopy> did you try another cable or usb-port?
00:09:49 <penguin1> I'm only got the usb-c to usb-c cable
00:10:00 <penguin1> which i'm using on the usbc port
00:10:05 <penguin1> laptop dell xps 13
00:14:20 <b1101> switched from fi to tmobile prepaid yesterday. I hope grapheneos keep growing, and support for future pixels arrives.
01:05:47 <nj11> Looking for some help installing graphene on a pixel 4a. I am on windows 10 and have verified the device comes up with both adb devices and fastboot devices. When I go to run the flash-all.bat the terminal screen flashes on for a brief moment and then disappears. Then nothing else happens. Any suggestions?
01:14:37 <louipx> are you using powershell
01:20:51 <tempest2478[m]> Power shell was the only way I could get it up and running. And follow the directions on the website exactly step by step and it should work fine. Download files directly into poweshell through command lines like the instructions say. I had the exact same problems using adb and flashboot that I downloaded off of a websire. The flash wouldn't work. As soon as I used poweshell for the whole process it worked no
01:20:51 <tempest2478[m]> issues.
01:22:54 <RockyDub> somenerd, Google maps does work as a web app
01:25:01 <grouch80[m]> Okay after reviewing some documentation https://grapheneos.org/usage I wondering is GOS supports the visual core on the 4xl. Can anyone confirm that the rear camera works on the 4xl? I still cannot get it to switch from the front to rear.
01:27:00 <nj11> I was not using the powershell. I will work on that route, thank you
01:28:59 <tempest2478[m]> grouch8.0: mine works
01:35:02 <grouch80[m]> tempest2478: What app are you using?
01:38:10 <tempest2478[m]> Both the stock camera and open camera
01:38:20 <tempest2478[m]> Both work front and rear
02:39:26 <banjo[m]> @freenode_penguin1:matrix.org: I got the xps 15 and the USB c port seems to be buggy. I've tested it with two original pixel cables. sometimes it works sometimes not. get a quality USB c to a cable and try one of the a ports
02:42:02 <banjo[m]> grouch8.0: might be a hardware issue
02:42:26 <banjo[m]> reset the phone
02:42:28 <grouch80[m]> Okay. So in the default camera app and Open Camera the button just doesn't exist. However, in Simple Camera,  I get an error, java.land.runtimeexception: time out waiting to lock camera opening. Any thoughts?
02:43:14 <grouch80[m]> I have done a reset. Same issue.
02:43:34 <banjo[m]> or flash stock see if it works then flash again graphene
02:43:54 <banjo[m]> probably hardware tho
02:44:22 <grouch80[m]> If it's hardware, there is no fix?
02:45:07 <banjo[m]> never heard of the issue around here and plenty of people have 4xl running graphene
02:45:24 <banjo[m]> going to a repair shop
02:46:02 <banjo[m]> try going back to stock before
02:46:34 <grouch80[m]> Alright. I'll try stock and report back. Thanks for the input.
02:46:57 <banjo[m]> you're welcome
02:46:59 <Scott74> Hi, I am trying to install on my pixel 4a, when I try to execute fastboot, I get < waiting for device > but device doesn't respond.  I've followed instructions on grapheneos.org.  When I connect phone to Windows PC, device is recognized.  Any ideas on why?
02:47:42 <Scott74> *when I connect to pc, pixel 4a is recognized without issue and shows up in explorer and in device mgr
02:49:41 <banjo[m]> type
02:49:49 <banjo[m]> fastboot devices
02:50:10 <banjo[m]> in the shell
02:50:42 <banjo[m]> it should be listed there
02:51:27 <banjo[m]> if not the problem is with the driver
02:52:02 <Scott74> nothing showing
02:54:09 <banjo[m]> https://www.qasimtricks.com/2020/04/fixed-fastboot-not-detecting-your-android-device.html
02:54:15 <Scott74> thank you
02:54:43 <banjo[m]> try this then type again fastboot devices
02:55:48 <Hamdy> folks, after successful installation of GrapheneOS on Pixel2XL, the OEM locking cannot be toggled on! As if it is locked by the carrier. anyone faced this issue or know why?
02:58:20 <banjo[m]> have you did this?
02:58:26 <banjo[m]> Next, go to Settings ➔ System ➔ Advanced ➔ Developer options and toggle on the 'Enable OEM unlocking' setting
02:58:29 <banjo[m]> Scott74:
02:59:04 <Hamdy> hi banjo, this is what i am saying. it cannot be enabled again from settings.
02:59:37 <banjo[m]> I was talking to scott
02:59:55 <banjo[m]> Hamdy: restart and try again
03:00:09 <Scott74> yes, I've enabled OEM unlocking
03:00:38 <banjo[m]> it works?
03:01:41 <Elementoshi[m]> Is GrapheneOS more... stable, than LineageOS? My LineageOS phone has a few quirks in it that require rebooting the phone to temporarily fix. I was thinking maybe since GrapheneOS only supports a few specific devices, there would be less bugs like that.
03:01:55 <Scott74> trying now
03:02:38 <banjo[m]> copenhagen_bram: yes by a longshot
03:03:00 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh cool
03:03:00 <banjo[m]> more secure as well. read on for more info
03:03:05 <Elementoshi[m]> What's the cheapest Google Pixel phone I can get?
03:03:10 <banjo[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq
03:03:19 <Elementoshi[m]> I know it's more secure, that's GrapheneOS's whole schtick
03:03:41 <banjo[m]> pixel 4a is recommended
03:04:13 <Elementoshi[m]> Okay. Not sure when I'll feel safe about spending money on it.
03:04:27 <banjo[m]> but a second hand 3a will be cheaper
03:05:10 <Elementoshi[m]> Hmm. Maybe a secondhand 4a would be good
03:05:21 <Elementoshi[m]> Why is 4a recommended over 3a?
03:07:35 <banjo[m]>  newer device therefore longer support period
03:07:45 <banjo[m]> also faster and better battery life
03:08:42 <Elementoshi[m]> Ah
03:09:43 <Elementoshi[m]> My internet is really slow and even duckduckgo takes forever to load, how much does a new 4a cost vs an used one?
03:09:53 <Elementoshi[m]> (In general)
03:10:43 <banjo[m]> not much less. it's a new phone and not many are available second hand
03:11:23 <banjo[m]> check your local listing site
03:11:27 <banjo[m]> or ebay
03:11:44 <rny> is the 3a even being sold now?
03:12:36 <banjo[m]> second hand yes
03:26:47 <Scott74> banjo[m] when trying to install the driver, getting error "Windows encountered a problem installing the drivers for your device"; The hash for the file is not present in the specified catalog file.  The file is likely corrupt or the victim of tampering.  I don't get the pop up "warning" me to continue installation.  Thoughts on how I can force
03:26:48 <Scott74> install>
03:28:45 <banjo[m]> try windows update and see if it installs the driver automatically
03:31:26 <banjo[m]> you should start from the begining with the guide and install all the required stuff
03:31:38 <Scott74> i tried that and didn't install
03:31:46 <Scott74> will try starting over
04:04:23 <jazzrabbit> test
04:07:53 <stencil[m]> Suggesion for the OS:
04:07:53 <stencil[m]>       1. Don't let even focused app access to clipboard, use a blank one for compatibility long press to cut, copy and paste
04:08:13 <stencil[m]> message here jazzrabbit
04:08:33 <somenerd[m]> maybe go onto GitHub?
04:08:47 <somenerd[m]> matrix might get messages buried
04:10:16 <dben> Hello world
04:11:42 <somenerd[m]> hello
04:24:32 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
04:24:46 <take_a_deep_brea> they came in to just say hello world.
04:26:33 <itZzenXX[m]> lmaooo
04:30:54 <phasnox[m]> <jonmonty[m] "It will create an anonymous acco"> noob question: Is the aurora store safe to use? I mean, is there a possibility those apks are tampered?
04:33:36 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont think so
04:33:37 <take_a_deep_brea> as the aurora store is a play store clientand directly obtains the app packages from google play store there is anyway the apps could get tampered along the way or on the servre
04:33:42 <take_a_deep_brea> but then what the apps themselves are is a different matter entirely
04:34:26 <somenerd[m]> Aurora store is foss
04:34:30 <somenerd[m]> same as F-droid
04:35:06 <somenerd[m]> I believe you can also verify apks, not sure how
04:35:06 <itZzenXX[m]> Aurora Droid is what i use, I would only use Aurora store if i absolutely have to
04:35:07 <somenerd[m]> this is kinda ot
04:35:23 <somenerd[m]> > Aurora Droid is what i use, I would only use Aurora store if i absolutely have to
04:35:23 <somenerd[m]> ?
04:35:30 <somenerd[m]> they're different
04:35:43 <somenerd[m]> Aurora droid is a frontend for f-droid
04:35:45 <itZzenXX[m]> while aurora store is better than plain google play store, it is still the play store, it just gets the APKs from the play store
04:35:54 <somenerd[m]> ok this is ot
04:36:07 <take_a_deep_brea> phasnox: it is more important that apps do not ask for too many permissions , do not have trackers (which can be verified inly to some extent ) , and also apps target the latest SDK version
04:36:18 <take_a_deep_brea> than the app itself being open sourced
04:36:47 <somenerd[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
04:36:49 <somenerd[m]> this may help
04:37:04 <somenerd[m]> also this is ot move to the offtopic channel
04:37:04 <take_a_deep_brea> an open source app which violates any of these or more than one of these is worse than Paid apps that follow these guidelines
04:37:10 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
04:37:26 <itZzenXX[m]> <somenerd[m] "also this is ot move to the offt"> ok
04:41:03 <phasnox[m]> thanks guys! I think I'm going almost all-in on my de-google-ing, just need my bank apps
04:41:22 <neo[m]> Does anyone know if a Pixel 4 on the Visible network would work on GOS? Remember seeing somewhere (Github?) at some point that there were issues with it
04:57:36 <tempest2478[m]> phasnox: I just need my bank and my music :(  sadly my bank app has a bunch of trackers and the website doesn't support all the features. Aside from that, I need to download all my music but I would want 24-bit 96hz  hifi quality so its not going to be easy.
05:00:23 <phasnox[m]> oh yes the music! I'll never understand why orgs insist in native apps instead of webapps.
05:02:03 <naithan_[m]> I got a somewhat paranoid question. So let's say that I'm a political dissident or some other person that's heavily targeted by the government of a technologically advanced country. Let's suppose that they have the ability to remotely compromise all my electronic devices at will, including my computers. Furthermore, let's suppose that they monitor my physical location 24/7, and has no qualms about hacking into any
05:02:03 <naithan_[m]> computer that I can get my hands on, be it at a public library or a friend's house.
05:02:03 <naithan_[m]> In this scenario, would I be able to securely install GrapheneOS onto a Pixel device using a compromised computer, or at least verify the integrity of the installation? Thanks, I just wanted to know for future reference.
05:02:11 <take_a_deep_brea> also in case you have specific network setup for each profile (tor,vpn...whatever)  then you better make sure that you end the session  before switching profiles , as if you leave the profile to run in backgrounf it will sttill access the network stack as configured by the profile running in foreground . so your traffic will get all mixed up .
05:02:39 <take_a_deep_brea> you may end up sending login data to google servers through tor , LMAO
05:03:01 <take_a_deep_brea> naithan_: the above response is not sddressed to you .
05:03:10 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry for the mixup
05:03:30 <naithan_[m]> No I realise, thx
05:03:49 <take_a_deep_brea> naithan_: by the way do you mind taking your query to the off-topic channel?
05:04:13 <naithan_[m]> Oh, sorry
05:04:29 <naithan_[m]> I'm not familiar with Matrix and chatrooms in general
05:04:36 <naithan_[m]> I'll ask there
05:04:40 <take_a_deep_brea> as it is regarding threat-models and not really about the system itself
05:04:41 <somenerd[m]> also 2D) from here https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
05:05:12 * somenerd[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/jWhPVpwIjRsoXVTIPyZZaqkc/message.txt >
05:06:18 <naithan_[m]> Well, let's say that no nation-state agencies are involved, and that I'm just a really wealthy dude with money to steal, and hackers want my money
05:06:39 <naithan_[m]> That doesn't break rule 2D right?
05:07:18 <take_a_deep_brea> naithan_: sure we can discuss this , but in the off-topic channel please . the discussionis OK as long as it does not turn into a mere argument without any exchange of knowledge
05:08:02 <naithan_[m]> Okay of course, how do I access the off-topic channel though? I can't see in on my sidebar
05:08:48 <naithan_[m]> Nevermind, I found the search button
05:08:49 <take_a_deep_brea> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
05:08:55 <take_a_deep_brea> click on this
05:09:02 <naithan_[m]> Okay thanks, I already joined
05:25:45 <various_house> Hey all! Would anyone be willing to help me figure out why I am not able to get grapheneos to install
05:27:30 <deappledapple> Go on
05:29:11 <various_house> when I run flash-all.sh I get all the way to the point where fastbootd shows up on my screen, then it either gets stuck saying <waiting for any device> or it will say failed (write to device failed(protocol error))
05:32:10 <deappledapple> Have you tried replugging to other usb ports, when it said <waiting for device>?
05:32:28 <deappledapple> It sounds more of a usb cable or port quality issue
05:32:55 <various_house> Ok, Ill try and find another one real quick
05:33:13 <various_house> its a brand new usb c to usb c cable so idk why it would be bad
05:37:07 <various_house> That did it! much appreciated!
05:37:21 <various_house> dumb of me not to have thought to try a different cable, thank you
05:37:56 <deappledapple> <various_house "That did it! much appreciated!"> Nice
05:39:05 <various_house> Im very new to graphene (I've only had it about a week) any recommendations you have for finding good foss apps or any just general wisdon
05:39:10 <various_house> wisdom*
05:39:33 <fiftyffs[m]> Hey. I got a pixel 4. is it possible to change the screen refresh rate, and put the phone in lockdown to temporarily disable biometric, like on google stock?
05:41:39 <deappledapple> <fiftyffs[m] "Hey. I got a pixel 4. is it poss"> Lockdown is also available on GrapheneOS, Display > Lock screen > Show lockdown option
05:42:00 <deappledapple> Screen refresh rate can be changed through adb
05:42:51 <fiftyffs[m]> <deappledapple "Lockdown is also available on Gr"> Alright. Thanks. I must have forgot where to find it.
05:48:31 <deappledapple> <various_house "Im very new to graphene (I've on"> You can try asking at #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for choice of apps and use cases involving GrapheneOS
05:50:46 <deappledapple> Topics tangential to GrapheneOS (such as app recommendation, use cases, etc) and general tech question goes there
07:17:29 <mishmasher[m]> Hmm for some reason off-topic  won't open for me
07:18:11 <mishmasher[m]> Nvm just as I said that it opened haha
07:29:30 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
07:57:54 <somenerd[m]> lol
08:53:56 <pallaf[m]> anyone else experience crashes when taking photos with flashlight? my phone suddenly reboots when I use flash on open camera and graphene's built in system camera application
09:47:39 <jjjk> hi, having problem were music still plays (spotify), but audio stops. Using pixel 3 with dongle. Usually happens after or near the end of a song. Checked the app and have all the correct settings enabled.
09:48:39 <jjjk> Also, app and phone are up to date. Also, tried different headphones, it works normally with them. Also, earphones are new
09:50:36 <sierocharlie[m]> Anyway to customize the graphene launcher? I don't want to install another launcher
09:51:10 <sierocharlie[m]> On my Pixel 4a it shortens all of my app names. Contacts > Contac... Even though there's enough room to display Contacts.
09:53:11 <take_a_deep_brea> well the graphene launcher is a bare minimum launcher .
09:53:24 <sierocharlie[m]> Any launcher you recommend?
09:53:41 <take_a_deep_brea> i used to use nova launcher .
09:53:44 <sierocharlie[m]> Literally all my app names are shortened, it annoys me
09:53:54 <take_a_deep_brea> i know
09:54:03 <banjo[m]> @sierocharlie other launchers break the gesture navigation
09:54:07 <take_a_deep_brea> i want to get rid of the names entirely
09:54:17 <sierocharlie[m]> <banjo[m] "@sierocharlie other launchers br"> I use 3 buttons. :) Don't like the gestures
09:54:45 <take_a_deep_brea> banjo: good that you told me this .i wouldnt let go of gesture navigation for anything
09:54:59 <banjo[m]> you're fine then. there are a few on fdroid
09:55:10 <sierocharlie[m]> lmao, I HATE gesture navigation
09:56:10 <banjo[m]> get used to it. buttons might be dropped in future versions of android
09:56:34 <take_a_deep_brea> well  as far as choosing an app goes there is this guide : https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
09:56:38 <banjo[m]> gestures take less space on screen
09:56:46 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
09:56:57 <take_a_deep_brea> i would rather get rid of the status bar too
09:57:06 <take_a_deep_brea> but cant do that anymore
09:58:24 <sierocharlie[m]> <banjo[m] "get used to it. buttons might be"> I don't even get how gestures work.
09:58:58 <banjo[m]> @sierocharlie: try them. you'll get used to them
09:59:00 <take_a_deep_brea> there is a small visual guide on the gesture settings . but i guess that didnt help you
10:00:01 <banjo[m]> take_a_deep_breath: yeah adb overscan expanding hack was nice. I actually miss it
10:02:08 <take_a_deep_brea> with a solid black bg and that adb hack you cannot make out wether the device screen is turned on or not , lol.
10:07:47 <sierocharlie[m]> Gestures are actually pretty nice. Don't think I'm going back LOL
10:08:04 <sierocharlie[m]> But you all have the thing (it isn't really an issue or bug) with the app names?
10:08:15 <sierocharlie[m]> And it just doesn't annoy you.
10:09:21 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont have that issue.
10:10:13 <sierocharlie[m]> So when you put contacts on the home screen it doesn't say Contac..?
10:10:25 <banjo[m]> @sierocharlie: try messing with font and display size in display settings
10:11:28 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah you better try doing that
10:11:54 <sierocharlie[m]> Yeah but then everything gets small. And there's only 4 options, not something in between.
10:12:13 <sierocharlie[m]> And using for e.g. openlauncher the app text shows normally, but openlauncher is super buggy.
10:13:17 <take_a_deep_brea> well i have some strange issues of my own like just now i long pressed on contacts and file manager and their names dissapeared from the launcher, lmao
10:13:34 <sierocharlie[m]> lmao
10:13:40 <sierocharlie[m]> You use default contacts and file manager?
10:13:49 <take_a_deep_brea> yes.

10:14:40 <sierocharlie[m]> This is what I mean
10:14:52 <take_a_deep_brea> ok clearing cache and storage seems to do the trick
10:15:08 <sierocharlie[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "ok clearing cache and storage se"> Of what?
10:15:25 <take_a_deep_brea> the launcher app
10:15:34 <sierocharlie[m]> Right.
10:15:58 <take_a_deep_brea> go to settings, search for launcher...
10:17:09 <banjo[m]> we should go to the offtopic with this stuff
10:17:20 <sierocharlie[m]> Sure
11:30:12 <sierocharlie[m]> Why are apps granted permission to sensors by default?
11:32:47 <nscnt[m]> @sierocharlie: Apps can't request this permission. They could break if they don't have it.
11:33:44 <sierocharlie[m]> I don't want apps to have access to my sensors unless I want them to. I disabled them on all apps that I don't want to have access, still works.
11:33:44 <sierocharlie[m]> I guess I'll have to try on a per app basis.
11:35:22 <wncry[m]> While we are talking about sensors what exact sensors does this permission grants access to?
11:35:50 <nscnt[m]> @sierocharlie: Sure, you can. However, GrapheneOS won't deny Sensors by default for the given reason.
11:36:16 <sierocharlie[m]> "Apps with this permission can access sensor data about orientation, movement, etc."
11:36:40 <sierocharlie[m]> <nscnt[m] "@sierocharlie: Sure, you can. Ho"> Right. But from a privacy perspective it is better to deny them the permission afterwards.
11:37:02 <sierocharlie[m]> There's no need for apps to be able to track such things.
11:37:39 <nscnt[m]> wncry: Every sensor, that isn't covered by another explicit permission.
11:41:26 <nscnt[m]> E.g. Microphone has its own permission.
11:43:28 <nscnt[m]> https://source.android.com/devices/sensors
11:43:42 <nscnt[m]> https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types
11:44:35 <sierocharlie[m]> Can I change what it shows on the notifcation bar in the lower left corner. 11 (RQ1A.210105.002)?
11:48:04 <nscnt[m]> I... don't even have that anymore, now that you mention it
12:34:02 <take_a_deep_brea> lol nscnt  hacked !
12:34:02 <take_a_deep_brea> no but seriously how come ?
13:06:26 <billybooy> Hello im trying to install grapheneos on a pixel 4a from ubuntu, using the official guide and the original usb c cable, but the flash-all.sh script just hangs, i see on the process list it spawned fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-sunfish-s5-0.3-6835615.img but it doesnt output anything on the terminal or phone screen..what do?
13:06:56 <billybooy> tried with a usb c -> usb a 3.0 cable (anker cable), same result
13:15:17 <user5535> Hello everybody
13:16:52 <user5535> I am a bit confused. I wanna install Graphene to my Xiaomi phone but I can't figure out if it's possible. I only see pixel devices as suggested and my phone is listed as an auditor? Do I give it a shot? Is it possible I ruin my phone?
13:17:53 <billybooy> Hello im trying to install grapheneos on a pixel 4a from ubuntu, using the official guide and the original usb c cable, but the flash-all.sh script just hangs, i see on the process list it spawned fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-sunfish-s5-0.3-6835615.img but it doesnt output anything on the terminal or phone screen..what do? (sorry i got
13:17:53 <billybooy> disconnected)
13:26:58 <frontman[m]1> Jesus
13:27:35 <frontman[m]1> What version fastboot?
13:29:27 <user5535> Any help on whether I can install Graphene on my Xiaomi phone?
13:29:39 <user5535> frontman[m]1?
13:29:47 <nscnt[m]> user5535: You can't.
13:30:02 <user5535> Dammit! Thank though!

13:30:27 <banjo[m]> user5535: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
13:30:44 <user5535> I saw the Pixel stuff. I'll try and get a pixel to give it a shot next time.
13:30:54 <user5535> Thanks for the help, guys!
13:36:29 <billybooy> any help
14:05:22 <billyboys> trying to install grapheneos on pixel 4a, flash-all.sh hangs on the first fastboot command (flashing bootloader). i dont know what to do, phone shows boot slot b now (used to show a on first try), im on ubuntu. what do? thanks! cable is original usb c
14:05:46 <billyboys> fastboot devices works but anything else not (also fastboot --set-active=a doest work, just hangs)

14:07:00 <billyboys> fastboot devices works but anything else not (also fastboot --set-active=a doest work, just hangs)
14:07:09 <Albakham[m]> <billybooy "any help"> what about `fastboot devices` ? Does your phone shows up?
14:07:21 <billyboys> yes it shows up
14:09:07 <frontman[m]1> Run fastboot --v
14:09:28 <strcat[m]> billyboys: did you do https://grapheneos.org/install#fastboot-as-non-root ?
14:09:33 <billyboys> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
14:09:34 <billyboys> Installed as /home/user/grapheneos/platform-tools/fastboot
14:09:43 <strcat[m]> billyboys: and also read what it says about USB ports / cables
14:09:44 <strcat[m]> the issue is probably USB
14:09:53 <billyboys> yes i installed also sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common
14:09:58 <strcat[m]> it's likely your computer has a broken USB-C implementation
14:10:12 <strcat[m]> showing up doesn't mean it works
14:10:29 <billyboys> i tried the original usb c cable, a usb c to usb a 3.0 cable (suggested here)..two different computers..same issues
14:11:34 <billyboys> tried with a brand new laptop with ubuntu and with a less newer one with also ubuntu..both laptops have usb c and usb a 3.0 ports that work for file transfer and everything else..also the cables work for file transfer
14:12:08 <strcat[m]> sounds like a USB port / controller / OS issue
14:12:12 <strcat[m]> working for other things doesn't mean they're reliable enough to work for fastboot
14:12:15 <strcat[m]> we see a lot of people run into this
14:12:15 <strcat[m]> the assumptions you're making aren't correct
14:12:20 <strcat[m]> other protocols tend to have a lot of layered on error handling to retry things until it works
14:12:31 <strcat[m]> fastboot doesn't
14:13:07 <billyboys> it seems like fastboot can read off the phone (getvar current slot does reply with "B" ) but cant write to the phone..permission issues? i cant run fastboot with sudo (it says fastboot doest exists)
14:13:52 <strcat[m]> reading is a lot less data than writing a huge image
14:14:23 <strcat[m]> billyboys: did you follow the instructions of plugging in the phone again after installing that package for the udev rules?
14:14:46 <strcat[m]> billyboys: also, if the computer did something wrong, it may have left a partial command sent
14:14:50 <strcat[m]> without finishining it
14:15:00 <frontman[m]1> I tried installing on my 3xl from Ubuntu but gave up. Booted into Windows and it worked.
14:15:04 <strcat[m]> billyboys: so reboot the phone back to the bootloader menu (it has a 'restart bootloader' option in the menu)
14:15:29 <billyboys> it hangs while flashing the bootloader which is around 8mb (the file)..yes i tried to plug it back again after installing the sdk..
14:15:44 <billyboys> i just did restart bootloader now, back in the black screen menu
14:15:44 <strcat[m]> sounds like your USB connection isn't reliable
14:15:58 <strcat[m]> and once it screws up like that you'll need to restart the bootloader menu
14:16:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> billyboys: pm me and we'll fix it
14:16:12 <billyboys> should i try with windows too? ok ill pm you thanks
14:16:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please do not try to reflash rn
14:16:30 <strcat[m]> billyboys:  yes
14:16:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> From the looks of it slot a has a corrupt bootloader and you booted b for that reason
14:16:31 <strcat[m]> use Windows
14:16:43 <strcat[m]> Windows USB support actually works
14:16:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well, yeah
14:16:53 <strcat[m]> unlike the Linux kernel which is broken on 1/4 laptops
14:17:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wow
14:17:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Interesting
14:17:37 <billyboys> allright will try this procedure again from windows.. need to shut down the pc..one question, should i restart the phone with the bootloader locked? so to start the procedure again with the exact steps as the grapheneos install guide
14:17:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway can you check the dev chat?
14:17:50 <strcat[m]> Windows and macOS are much less likely to have issues - macOS is essentially only on official Apple hardware which pretty much eliminates all these hardware / driver issues people run into
14:18:24 <strcat[m]> if people are installing on a Macbook with the Pixel USB-C cable, there's a slim chance of any issues aside from their own mistakes
14:18:43 <strcat[m]> on Windows? could be broken USB ports/controllers/drivers (or a cable, if no native USB-C)
14:19:02 <strcat[m]> Linux makes the driver issues far more likely (it's super common) along with other distribution specific issues
14:19:12 <strcat[m]> USB working properly is not a given
14:19:15 <strcat[m]> at all
14:19:32 <strcat[m]> I'd say that 50%+ of USB-A to USB-C cables are broken / not to spec
14:19:47 <strcat[m]> USB-C has serious issues with lack of standards compliance
14:19:53 <strcat[m]> it's a more demanding specification
14:20:05 <strcat[m]> also some kinds of products are inherently broken
14:20:06 <billyboys> sorry anapritaisno1 cant pm you (not a registered user).. should i do something to the phone before trying again to install grapheneos from windows? now is device state: unlocked boot slot: b..should i lock it again? what about the boot slot? sorry for questions
14:20:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Is USB2 USB-C even a spec.
14:20:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: don't think it's a problem
14:20:32 <strcat[m]> just odd
14:20:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have USB2 cables that go over USB-C
14:20:39 <strcat[m]> for example I'm sure you've seen USB extension cables... the USB spec doesn't support those and they are inherently broken for USB-C
14:20:51 <strcat[m]> so, many companies are selling an inherently broken non-compliant product type...
14:21:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Difference between a hub and an extension is?
14:21:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: an extension tries to just extend the cable without another controller
14:22:01 <strcat[m]> with USB-C you can't do that
14:22:18 <strcat[m]> at least without running 2 sets of cables down the whole thing which none of these companies would do
14:22:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> So USB hubs have their own controller?
14:22:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes
14:22:55 <strcat[m]> USB has a topology
14:22:56 <fr1endly_gh0st> If this has already been answered then apologies, I was about to reply and my box died. Anyway, are you trying to install GrapheneOS through Windows or *nix?
14:23:01 <strcat[m]> a controller shows up to the OS
14:23:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmm interesting, will check later
14:23:18 <strcat[m]> an extension cable tries to physically extend a cable
14:23:24 <strcat[m]> which the USB standard has never supported
14:23:27 <strcat[m]> and it's broken with USB-C
14:23:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway check dev chat for a bit I finished the carrier changes
14:23:37 <fr1endly_gh0st> Oh, he's gone.
14:24:09 <technoph0bian[m]> Linux is usually fine nowadays. Are you sure that you have a high quality usb-c cable? I had the exact problem you are describing because of a low-quality cable.
14:24:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> technoph0bian: iirc last time Google fuzzed the Linux usb system
14:24:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> They ran into bugs before the USB even got accepted
14:24:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's bad
14:25:10 <strcat[m]> technoph0bian: it's fine with USB 2 / USB-A
14:25:16 <strcat[m]> it has serious issues with USB-C and 3.1, etc.
14:25:29 <strcat[m]> it has a tendency to be broken
14:25:41 <strcat[m]> technoph0bian: it's a lot less bad in current kernels (i.e. 5.10, etc.)
14:26:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also 3.1 is a very confusing standard afaik
14:26:07 <strcat[m]> but if someone is using Debian stable they have 4.19 and without the kind of backports that the Android common kernels get
14:26:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's several generations to it
14:26:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there is some superspeed nonsense too
14:26:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: focus on getting CarrierConfig stuff submitted
14:26:56 <fr1endly_gh0st> anupritaisno1 are you referring to the same paper that led to the creation of the OMG cables?
14:27:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: it's done
14:27:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Checked it too, it's good to go
14:27:42 <technoph0bian[m]> I'm using arch so that could be why I don't have problems with usb-c
14:28:00 <technoph0bian[m]> Latest kernel
14:30:06 <strcat[m]> it's a lot less bad in more recent kernel branches
14:30:07 <strcat[m]> but it's still an issue
14:30:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <fr1endly_gh0st "anupritaisno1 are you referring "> Honestly those are nothing new
14:31:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Attacks where devices pretend to be keyboards and mice have existed for a long time now
14:31:56 <fr1endly_gh0st> Jeez, ok sorry lol. Didn't come here fo the attack, just trying to join in with the conversation.
14:31:59 <technoph0bian[m]> <strcat[m] "but if someone is using Debian s"> Debian stable is a terrible idea for any desktop.
14:51:07 <billyboy> hello, im the user from earlier trying to install grapheneos on the pixel 4a.. im now on windows and followed the guide but here fastboot doesnt even see the phone.. now the phone is "unlocked, boot slot b, enter reason:combo key". should i do something to the phone before trying? thanks
14:53:21 <stencil[m]> So you installed the fastboot right?
14:53:21 <strcat[m]> reboot the bootloader again and plug it in again
14:53:31 <strcat[m]> to avoid whatever went wrong with what you did on Linux
14:56:00 <billyboy> yes installed fastboot (version 30), i now selected "restart bootloader" on the phone, unplugged and replugged the phone..windows does the "new usb" sound but "fastboot devices" shows nothing..
14:56:44 <nscnt[m]> billyboy: In Windows Update, search for updates. Then there might be "View optional updates" where a driver update might be.
14:58:05 <billyboy> i see "lemobile android bootloader interface" on the optional updates..installing that now
14:58:08 <axx> i recently (latest update?) had the wallpaper on my different profiles get reset, is this a problem that others experienced too?
14:58:12 <nscnt[m]> That's it!
14:58:17 <nscnt[m]> This should fix it.
14:58:25 <billyboy> *fingers crossed
14:58:47 <billyboy> ok installed, should i reboot?
14:58:51 <nscnt[m]> axx: The default wallpaper is black now.
14:58:56 <nscnt[m]> No, don't reboot
14:59:00 <billyboy> nice, now fastboot devices shows up the phone
14:59:16 <billyboy> ok will try to continue now
15:00:30 <billyboy> now i started the flash-all.bat script and is doing stuff omg
15:00:52 <nscnt[m]> Don't touch it, until there's written: Press any key to exit
15:00:58 <billyboy> im sweaty as heckk
15:02:33 <billyboy> ok now i pressed any key to exit and im back to the fastboot mode
15:03:24 <billyboy> locked the boot loader too..so this is it?
15:03:25 <axx> <nscnt[m] "axx: The default wallpaper is bl"> wow, are we trying to scare away users now? :)
15:03:55 <billyboy> what about boot slot b? something i should care? thanks for the help
15:04:19 <deappledapple> See https://grapheneos.org/install#post-installation
15:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> billyboy: once the phone boots for the first time and you've locked the bootloader, there is no need to worry about Slot B. The update client will take care of that for you.
15:04:54 <TheJollyRoger> That's what it's there for.
15:04:55 <deappledapple> Boot, disable OEM unlock and use Auditor constantly to check for OS integrity and authenticity
15:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> (but you need to lock the bootloader first.)
15:05:23 <deappledapple> (As in every n hours for either local or remote attestationl
15:07:08 <billyboy> the auditor should be used more than once? isnt that meant to be used after installation as verification that the os is not corrupted?
15:07:21 <TheJollyRoger> So once your phone boots with the bootloader locked, deappledapple 's got some pretty savvy advice: turn off OEM unlocking, provision Auditor, and you are good to go.
15:07:28 <djskqks[m]> does anyone know when is there coming the MicroG variant on GrapheneOS. On their site they say they are working on it.
15:07:41 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor is used both on a one-time and ongoing basis.
15:08:30 <TheJollyRoger> djskqks[m]: Help is wanted. If you have experience with android, that's probably the best way to help move things along and get a picture for how soon it'll get here.
15:08:37 <deappledapple> <djskqks[m] "does anyone know when is there c"> Can't tell, maybe if there's a microG repo on Github, maybe it's near
15:09:06 <djskqks[m]> <deappledapple "Can't tell, maybe if there's a m"> Okey thanks
15:09:30 <deappledapple> <TheJollyRoger "djskqks: Help is wanted. If you "> Yeah, this will be appreciated too
15:11:08 <TheJollyRoger> billyboy: What Auditor does is pretty neat: there's a writeup on https://attestation.app/tutorial, but in a nutshell, every phone that originally shipped with Android 8.0 or later, or Pixels contain the means to attest to their own verified boot hash and verified boot keys while the bootloader is locked, then sign the attestation data with a hardware-backed key, which is validated by a lot key,
15:11:09 <TheJollyRoger> which is validated by a vendor's key, which is validated by Google's key, which is self-signed and widely known. This gives a fallback for a trust-on-first certificate pinning, which then Auditor relies on for subsequent attestations.
15:12:40 <TheJollyRoger> So when you first pair a device with Auditor the first time, it relies on those digital signatures the first time, then it remembers the key your phone gave it the first time and relies on that, so it's quite strong.
15:12:47 <TheJollyRoger> So you can use Auditor several ways:
15:13:33 <TheJollyRoger> You can use it for verifying the authenticity of the installation once, AND you can use it for remotely self-monitoring the authenticity of the installation every couple of hours, and alerting you should your phone fail to check in, OR check in wrong.
15:13:42 <TheJollyRoger> It's quite versatile.
15:14:37 <TheJollyRoger> *or Pixels, starting with the Pixel 2 (The Pixel 1 shipped with Android 7.0. It cannot do remote attestation.)
15:22:31 <somenerd[m]> How does it verify the installation though?
15:23:51 <deappledapple> <somenerd[m] "How does it verify the installat"> If the OS installation is not modified
15:24:03 <somenerd[m]> Ohhhhh
15:25:35 <somenerd[m]> So it complements verified boot (kinda)
15:26:24 <strcat[m]> read https://attestation.app/about
15:27:22 <somenerd[m]> Yeah after reading the docs and the previous messages, I think that I’ve got what auditor is for
15:33:23 <strcat> somenerd[m]: it gives you information verified by hardware rather than trusting the UI on the phone
15:33:31 <strcat> that's the point
15:33:53 <strcat> so you can check the OS patch level and a bunch of other things
15:33:58 <strcat> without trusting the UI of the phone
15:34:13 <strcat> so for example if an attacker compromised it and blocked security updates
15:34:34 <strcat> which would have the potential to block whatever they're doing to exploit it each boot
15:34:41 <strcat> (not just security updates but updates in general)
15:35:03 <strcat> then that would be visible in a way they can't fake without more deeply exploiting firmware, etc.
15:35:13 <strcat> somenerd[m]: it does more than 1 specific thing
15:35:19 <strcat> it has various use cases
15:37:29 <billyboy> one question about accounts..after first boot i have "owner (admin)".. i created another user and would like to use said user for normal phone usage, while using the owner account to do administrative stuff (like updates?) is this correct or i misunderstood something? thank you
15:38:48 <axx> <axx "wow, are we trying to scare away"> no but seriously, it's a pretty bad idea to put a black background. It's what Android shows when it fails to show a background.. it essentially conveys the meaning "this OS is unfinished / has an issue"
15:39:07 <axx> on a related note, removing the background image i, the user, had decided to set up, and replacing with nothing, is pretty bad practice
15:39:23 <axx> don't reset people's settings to default, especially without warning
15:39:48 <nscnt[m]> It doesn't reset peoples background. It changes the default background
15:40:03 <nscnt[m]> If you used the default background, it will change
15:40:14 <nscnt[m]> If you used your own background, it will not be changed
15:40:30 <axx> meh i pas pretty sure i'd set my own background in my main session…
15:40:42 <axx> maybe i'm wrong, in which case i retract what i said above
15:41:03 <axx> is there a place i can see the previous default backgrounds?
15:42:00 <somenerd[m]> >it has various use cases
15:42:00 <somenerd[m]> Thanks for the help strcat!
15:44:09 <axx> not here apparently : https://github.com/GrapheneOS/branding :)
15:44:22 <axx> (or not here yet, shall we say)
15:45:39 <deappledapple> <axx "is there a place i can see the p"> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/8398e8261e451358b779514569825ae7a94ef579/core/res/res/drawable-sw600dp-nodpi/default_wallpaper.png
15:46:22 <deappledapple> <nscnt[m] "If you used your own background,"> Can confirm it did not change when there's a set background prior to that update
15:46:28 <axx> thanks, so that was my wallpaper on my secondary / work profile, but not on my main profile. My main profile's wallpaper got reset to black. I assumed there had been a bug.
15:46:36 <axx> <deappledapple "Can confirm it did not change wh"> so i can confirm the opposite
15:47:03 <deappledapple> It would have been reported before you do if that really happened
15:47:16 <deappledapple> especially for early beta testers
15:49:21 <deappledapple> I have a copy of 12.12.03 release if somebody wants to test this
15:49:23 <deappledapple> (for sargo)
15:50:48 <deappledapple> Since the change of wallpaper happened on 01.05.03 release
15:51:30 <strcat> axx: the default background was changed
15:51:41 <strcat> axx: there was NO CHANGE to backgrounds set by users
15:51:54 <strcat> and I don't see how it's a bad idea to use a black background as the default
15:52:27 <strcat> it doesn't matter what it shows when it fails to load a background, it isn't something the vast majority of users would know or think about anyway
15:52:42 <axx> i hear there was no change to user-set background, i was sure i'd set the background i had, as it was different from the one shared above by Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?, which was indeed the one i had in my work profile (the pink sky)
15:52:56 <strcat> there was no change to user set backgrounds
15:53:00 <axx> <strcat "and I don't see how it's a bad i"> because is looks like the OS failed to load one of its most basic components: the wallpaper
15:53:01 <strcat> there was only a change to the default background
15:53:09 <axx> it gives users a feeling that this OS has a problem
15:53:15 <strcat> I don't see how it does that
15:53:17 <axx> that's why you'd want a tiny logo at least somewhere
15:53:34 <strcat> we don't want a logo on the background, we decided it looked bad especially due to how the background is sometimes panned
15:53:36 <nscnt[m]> Background is probably the last basic component of the OS ^^
15:53:50 <strcat> we prefer having a simple black background at the moment
15:53:55 <strcat> logo doesn't look good
15:54:00 <strcat> keep in mind there are icons on top of it, etc.
15:54:12 <axx> i'm sure a logo doesn't look great
15:54:15 <strcat> a dark pattern would be fine but we don't want a logo
15:54:22 <strcat> a black background looks really good imo
15:54:26 <deappledapple> * Since the change of wallpaper (edit: in this context, the default one) happened on 01.05.03 release
15:54:28 <strcat> and it fits the OS
15:54:42 <nscnt[m]> Agree
15:54:43 <strcat> it's not our job to stop power users from making bad assumptions
15:55:02 <strcat> this isn't something regular users will think about - they won't consider that it has failed to load anything, or that it would show a black background if it hasn't
15:55:06 <strcat> you're just overthinking it
15:55:19 <strcat> I really don't see the issue with using a black background as the default
15:55:22 <strcat> you're free to change it
15:55:36 <axx> yeah, it's not really about technical people's personal appreciation of a simple logo or their esthetics, i get why nerds disable visual effects, opt for plain colour or black backgrounds.. I'm talking about the message it conveys to new users
15:55:49 <axx> but this message is quite clearly falling on deaf ears
15:55:56 <axx> so i'm not going to beat that horse :)
15:56:19 <strcat> it's really inappropriate to start trying to portray it as something that has been chosen by 'nerds' without considering messaging to new users
15:56:32 <strcat> you aren't a non-technical user, the only reason you are upset about this is from overthinking it as a 'power user'
15:56:47 <strcat> a non-technical user is not going to think about whether a wallpaper has loaded or not
15:57:02 <strcat> when you look at the app drawer, do you think the wallpaper has failed to load because it has a solid color background?
15:57:23 <strcat> a lot of pages already have a solid color background, app drawer is solid white/black
15:58:09 <strcat> people are free to set the wallpapers of their choice for each profile
15:58:23 <axx> <strcat "when you look at the app drawer,"> that's quite besides the point and, to me, shows you are not really getting the problem i'm trying to convey
15:58:43 <strcat> a tiny, vocal minority of people are upset that we changed it to a black background
15:58:52 <strcat> it's the default wallpaper
15:58:53 <strcat> you can change it
15:58:54 <axx> black = no wallpaper = oh, what's going on?
15:59:04 <axx> any other colour would probably be understood to mean there was a choice
15:59:07 <axx> any shade of grey even
15:59:15 <stencil[m]> My wallpaper recently changed to iphone-esque one in miui
15:59:15 <axx> anyway…
15:59:18 <strcat> I don't see the problem with having a very basic black wallpaper by ddefault
15:59:30 <strcat> and I don't see how that would make people think they don't have a choice
15:59:37 <axx> is there a way to see the previous default wallpapers before the pink one?
15:59:45 <stencil[m]> The problem is that it couldn't be changed back but that doesn't seem like a problem here
15:59:56 <axx> i can see any older banches in https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/branches/all
16:00:22 <axx> <strcat "I don't see the problem with hav"> yes, that's quite clear :)
16:00:24 <strcat> axx: that pink wallpaper was the default in AOSP for years
16:00:48 <strcat> a logo underneath icons really doesn't look good
16:00:50 <strcat> we don't want to do that
16:01:09 <deappledapple> Not too sure why would a future GrapheneOS user would mind or be discouraged from a black wallpaper, which can be changed. Don't they switch to that OS usually for its features?
16:01:10 <strcat> we'd consider having some kind of dark texture/pattern matching the OS theme, etc.
16:01:20 <axx> i'm not arguing in favour of a logo
16:01:28 <strcat> I think a lot of people will appreciate having a black wallpaper by default
16:01:38 <strcat> especially compared to the previous default
16:01:48 <TheJollyRoger> Let me see if I can find you something.
16:02:08 <axx> i was just saying you'd want a sign that there is a wallpaper, rather than plain black, which is what Android shows when it fails to show the wallpaper
16:02:20 <strcat> yeah and it would normally never fail to load the wallpaper
16:02:29 <strcat> and no normal user is going to know that or think about it
16:03:04 <justanotherlurke> Like grey graphene logo on black wallpaper.
16:03:09 <strcat> we don't want a logo
16:03:12 <strcat> it looks bad underneath icons
16:03:13 <axx> <deappledapple "Not too sure why would a future "> it's this small thing called "attention to detail". If it conveys the sense that there's a lack of attention to detail (even though the choice was very deliberate) then that reflects poorly on the project
16:03:27 <strcat> it gets partially covered and having high contrast borders underneath icons looks bad
16:03:35 <justanotherlurke> <strcat "it looks bad underneath icons"> True.
16:03:38 <strcat> a solid color looks good, as does a photo
16:03:43 <strcat> having a logo looks really bad
16:03:58 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, huh. Whoops.
16:04:01 <strcat> and I don't think a photo fits the aesthetic of the OS
16:04:07 <deappledapple> <axx "it's this small thing called "at"> See again the question. They didn't switch to GrapheneOS for aesthetics, bur for privacy, security features. How would that reflect poorly on project?
16:04:10 <axx> yes, please stop about the logo, we all agree
16:04:28 <axx> <deappledapple "See again the question. They did"> in the same way.. you are not getting my point i think :)
16:04:30 <TheJollyRoger> Let me see if I have any high-resolution images of metal, or carbon fiber, or something of the sort.
16:04:30 <strcat> no matter what we choose for the aesthetic
16:04:31 <justanotherlurke> <strcat "a solid color looks good, as doe"> Need to transfer some photos to the phone then.
16:04:33 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "See again the question. They did"> or enhancements
16:04:33 <strcat> someone is going to complain
16:04:42 <axx> i agree with you, people switch for reasons other than esthetics
16:05:03 <strcat> black matches a lot of other stuff
16:05:05 <mulbr[m]> Easy to be an armchair critic
16:05:05 <axx> if the OS looks like something maybe didn't load on fist boot, it doesn't reflect very well on the OS
16:05:13 <strcat> it really doesn't look like that
16:05:20 <strcat> while it's booting the background is black
16:05:27 <axx> that's why you'd want something to convey the fact that this is a deliberate choice
16:05:34 <somenerd[m]> What are the other options?
16:05:35 <axx> and i'm not sure that's possible with a plain black background
16:05:36 <deappledapple> yeah, it's getting close to bikeshedding now
16:05:40 <strcat> we're happy with black
16:05:40 <mulbr[m]> Harder to contribute in a meaningful or positive way
16:05:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it is.
16:05:52 <justanotherlurke> <strcat "black matches a lot of other stu"> I like the black much better than the one before.
16:05:54 <strcat> the firmware background is black
16:05:55 <axx>  * if the OS looks like something maybe didn't load its background on fist boot, it doesn't reflect very well on the OS
16:05:59 <strcat> the boot animation is black background
16:06:04 <TheJollyRoger> We got a nuclear plant to develop and let's stop caring what colour we paint the employee bike sheds.
16:06:07 <strcat> and then it loads up a black background for the lockscreen / home page
16:06:13 <axx> <mulbr[m] "Harder to contribute in a meanin"> is that directed to me?
16:06:24 <strcat> and because the home page has icons and widgets on top of it
16:06:30 <strcat> a solid color is really nice
16:06:41 <strcat> it's also nice for usability of the OS
16:06:46 <strcat> it's easier to see icons and read text
16:06:47 <deappledapple> This time that's consumed at the moment could have been used on reviewing pull requests, developing a certain features, or improving the site
16:06:51 <strcat> it's a good thing for accessibility
16:06:55 <strcat> not everyone has good eyesight
16:07:02 <strcat> some people are color blind too
16:07:14 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "This time that's consumed at the"> Yet here we are arguing about the black backgroundo
16:07:26 <strcat> and I think it looks good, that's why I had set as my background already
16:07:33 <axx> <TheJollyRoger "We got a nuclear plant to develo"> i initially came to ask if other people had had their background reset.. and made a side comment about how having a black wallpaper could look like the OS has an issue. Which is something people here apparently don't want to hear.
16:07:42 <taziden> deappledapple: and worse, we're commenting the debate without having anything to add about it
16:07:50 <strcat> no one had their configured bg reset
16:07:53 <strcat> only the default changed
16:07:56 <axx> <deappledapple "This time that's consumed at the"> Sure. No one's forcing you to answer instead of doing PR review. Give me a break, no point in being holier than thou :)
16:08:02 <strcat> we literally only changed the default image file
16:08:07 <strcat> we didn't change any code or configuration
16:08:26 <deappledapple> <axx "Sure. No one's forcing you to an"> It's literally on the rules in GrapheneOS rules

16:08:30 <strcat> this is the whole change
16:08:35 <strcat> we changed 3 pngs to solid black
16:08:42 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "It's literally on the rules in G"> "Do not engage on bikeshedding"
16:08:50 <strcat> bonus: the OS is 1-2MB smaller
16:09:20 <axx> <strcat "and I think it looks good, that'"> and there we have it: it's ultimately a personal choice from the project owner, that's the most straightforward explanation, and the one that saves a lot of conversation, as it makes it clear that there won't really be a dialogue on this question
16:09:21 <axx> and that's fine
16:09:59 <strcat> there can be a dialogue - but you're claiming to speak for non-technical people when you really don't
16:10:01 <deappledapple> <strcat "it's easier to see icons and rea"> Yeah, cherrypick why they think it's a good point and ignore this chain of message
16:11:00 <strcat> it matches the theme of the OS more, it draws a distinction from AOSP, it is more usable and accessible (much easier to read and see icons)
16:11:13 <strcat> if someone wants to set it to a picture of their dog or w/e they can happily do that
16:11:29 <strcat> I don't think we should set it to a photo
16:11:29 <TheJollyRoger> axx: Sorry if I got a little testy there with that, I think what many here will take issue with, tends to be insisting on something after it's been explained this is a deliberate and considered decision, not a bug.
16:11:36 <deappledapple> "Ultimately a personal choice" sounds like they just chose it in discretion without any reasonable justification
16:11:36 <deappledapple> No offense though
16:11:49 <grandba_shark> i love the solid black background
16:12:00 <strcat> I would consider setting it to a nice pattern but it has to match the OS aesthetic
16:12:04 <strcat> so for example
16:12:18 <strcat> a grid of tiles with black borders and random dark grayscale colors
16:12:21 <strcat> little tiles
16:12:32 <strcat> all very dark - it shouldn't be super prominent that the colors are varied
16:12:40 <strcat> anyway for now, I prefer just having a black background
16:13:02 <strcat> and I will only consider other options that are also near uniformly black
16:13:09 <TheJollyRoger> strcat, axx , I tell you what, let me go and see if I can find someone who has a carbon fiber print car, and I'll take a picture of it with my macro lens.
16:13:09 <strcat> but I think I may just prefer leaving it as solid black for good
16:13:13 <strcat> imo it looks really good
16:13:16 <TheJollyRoger> What do you guys think?
16:13:18 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I don't want a photo
16:13:22 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, okay.
16:13:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot erase misc
16:13:27 <strcat> if there was a texture/pattern I would want it to be computer generated
16:13:34 <axx> <deappledapple ""Do not engage on bikeshedding""> you are missing my point if you think i'm discussing esthetics
16:13:35 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see.
16:13:37 <strcat> it better fits the aesthetic and then it's easy to generate it at any scale
16:13:38 <grandba_shark> solid black
16:13:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> White logo for one boot
16:13:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't recommend erasing misc btw
16:14:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it'll be white logo for one boot
16:14:33 <axx> <TheJollyRoger "axx: Sorry if I got a little tes"> I understand that, and i was not there for the discussion. I'm just telling you, as a longtime user, than when a wallpaper gets changed to plain black, it just looks like something failed to load and that there is a bug somewhere
16:14:34 <deappledapple> (Aesthetics) is not really the main focus of the project last time grapheneos.org is updated
16:14:35 <axx> it's as simple as that
16:15:02 <strcat> back when I changed the Chromium logo to black there was someone who thought that it was some kind of bug or indication that something went wrong but since it has *always been that way* for most users now they would never consider that
16:15:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <axx "I understand that, and i was not"> If anything, it tells us that our seamless updates are working fine
16:15:38 <axx> has a simple pop-up screen after OS update to explain visible changes that may confuse users been considered?
16:15:45 <axx> it would avoid a lot of misunderstanding
16:15:45 <strcat> axx: but from now on no one will see it change to black
16:15:51 <strcat> axx: it's already done
16:15:57 <strcat> it's black from the start for everyone
16:16:44 <TheJollyRoger> axx: Yep, I get you, you're asking about QoS.
16:17:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "axx: Yep, I get you, you're aski"> No
16:17:31 <deappledapple> For old users, there's a changelog on grapheneos.org/releases
16:18:05 <strcat> I would accept a change linking to the changelog after reboot
16:18:07 <strcat> implemented well
16:18:25 <strcat> in a notification
16:18:30 <strcat> press notification -> takes you to the site
16:18:37 <strcat> I don't want it to fetch the changelog
16:18:41 <strcat> or have to upload them to the update server
16:19:12 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.05.03
16:19:20 <strcat> can just generate a link like that based on BUILD_NUMBER
16:19:32 <strcat> although extended support releases don't have entries there
16:19:46 <strcat> need a toggle to turn it on / off
16:20:28 <axx> also, i went back to the tag from April 2019 in the repo, when i installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel2, and i can see that the pink sky was the default at that point https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/blob/PQ2A.190405.003.2019.04.01.19/core/res/res/drawable-nodpi/default_wallpaper.png I can confirm that this was not the wallpaper on my phone's main profile before the latest update. And, as such, that my
16:20:28 <axx> user-chosen wallpaper was changed to the plain black background.
16:20:51 <axx> obviously, i'm never going to be able to reproduce that bug
16:21:35 <axx> but, as was my initial intention in coming here, there was clearly some sort of bug, which it felt worth: a/ asking about and b/ reporting or at least sharing
16:22:27 <axx> <strcat "axx: but from now on no one will"> well… yes. It may still surprise people on first boot. But we'll see!
16:23:44 <strcat> axx: the first thing they see is SetupWizard
16:23:57 <strcat> axx: I really doubt that a user chosen bg was changed
16:24:04 <strcat> all we did is change the default wallpaper png
16:24:08 <strcat> we didn't do anything else
16:24:12 <strcat> I think you're mistaken about what happened
16:25:38 <axx> <strcat "axx: I really doubt that a user "> i'm literally reporting that it did. I even went and checked, to rule out the possiblitiy that my background was actually a very old default, that i couldn't remember was the default.
16:25:57 <axx> It wasn't, the default when i installed GrapheneOS was already the pink sky, which wasn't my wallpaper
16:26:08 <strcat> well, I don't think that happened
16:26:31 <strcat> it was probably that purple / pink one
16:26:39 <axx> (if nothing else, i knew my work profile wallpaper was pink when my main was blue/green, it just helped know very easily in which profile i was at a glance)
16:26:52 <axx> for fuck's sake man, have a little trust in your users
16:26:56 <axx> i'm telling you it happened
16:27:08 <strcat> and I believe that you think it's what happened
16:27:13 <strcat> and that it's how you remember it
16:27:16 <axx> i get you might be annoyed at me for thoroughly questioning a design decision
16:27:17 <strcat> but I don't think that happened
16:27:18 <axx> i get that
16:27:22 <axx> but this anotehr isuse
16:27:32 <strcat> all we did is change the default png
16:27:37 <axx> <strcat "and that it's how you remember i"> this is unbelievable.. the level of denial
16:27:42 <strcat> which is only a fallback when none is set
16:27:44 <axx> you write great code man, i'm pretty sure of that ok?
16:27:49 <strcat> it's not our code
16:27:51 <strcat> again
16:27:51 <axx> that being said, i use that phone every day
16:27:53 <strcat> we didn't change any code
16:27:58 <strcat> all we did is change the default png
16:28:05 <axx> and i can tell if my background changed or not :)
16:28:21 <strcat> and I know what we changed and how that is handled by the AOSP code
16:28:26 <axx> i can understand how it doesn't make sense from a code standpoint
16:28:34 <axx> i'm just reporting what happened on my Pixel 2
16:28:43 <strcat> it also doesn't make sense that only 1 person out of all GrapheneOS users ran into it
16:29:05 <strcat> it's a bit of a different situation than say, a desktop OS without verified boot
16:29:13 <strcat> we have a guarantee that all users have bit-for-bit identical OS images
16:29:28 <strcat> and they are using a specific set of phone models we officially support
16:29:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> After this bs I'm going to be rather wary of suggesting changes to defaults
16:29:41 <strcat> same hardware with different suppliers for a couple parts
16:29:43 <strcat> not many differences
16:29:51 <strcat> just different RAM / SSD supplier in some cases, etc.
16:30:03 <strcat> from the perspective of the OS it's all the same
16:30:19 <strcat> so there aren't variations in the hardware, firmware or OS across devices
16:30:27 <strcat> the only variations are in user configuration / state in data
16:30:31 <strcat> and we can see how the code uses that
16:30:48 <axx> honestly, i'd much rather realise that i was just using a previously default wallpaper and that's why it was it was reset. It doesn't appear to be the case, as my background was not the pink sky that has been the default since at least march 2019, from what i can tell, looking at the repo
16:31:10 <strcat> that would have changed to the newer one when that changed anyway
16:32:03 <axx> exactly
16:32:04 <mulbr[m]> Prob best to let this back and forth go and move on. Shake the proverbial virtual hand and next topic
16:32:04 <axx> and as my background was not the pink sky one…
16:32:47 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/18b644c926562b1531876f7d7b922fee8290d9c7?short_path=1cc0a62#diff-1cc0a627191704e284c4708ed3465910e7adccaf1f6ff4e52b3ec591492b10e2
16:32:48 <strcat[m]> is genuinely all we changed
16:32:53 <axx> agreed, in any case if this didn't happen to anyone else, then it's a corner case of some sort and probably not worth fixing
16:33:08 <axx> <strcat[m] "is genuinely all we changed"> then i'm as baffled as you
16:33:36 <strcat[m]> I replaced 3 images with new ones I made with imagemagick
16:33:41 <strcat[m]> same dimensions
16:34:39 <axx> yes i get that
16:34:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat can unironically do everything /s
16:35:15 <deappledapple> <anupritaisno1[m] "strcat can unironically do every"> The GrapheneOS code: "reality can be whatever I want"
16:35:28 <deappledapple> (To add on that joke)
16:35:29 <axx> i was not trying to point blame.. however some folks did get very defensive
16:35:33 <axx> i just said what happened
16:35:59 <axx> and, let's be honest, was met with a patronising response that i was likely misremembering it
16:36:01 <strcat[m]> and part of what you learn as an open source developer is that users sometimes don't correctly remember what happened
16:36:19 <strcat[m]> sometimes people attribute things to updates that were not related to updates
16:36:21 <axx> right
16:36:27 <axx> thanks for more patronising :) excellent stuff
16:36:33 <axx> i work in and for open source all day
16:36:45 <axx> anyway, this is just getting a bit much
16:36:48 <axx> so i'm going to go for a walk
16:37:01 <strcat[m]> an update happens to be the rare time most people ever reboot
16:37:09 <axx> always been a suporter of the project, but this is a bit unpleasant
16:37:28 <axx> going to remove my laste messages, as they were written in annoyance
16:37:36 <deappledapple> Figures, some corrections are unpleasant
16:37:54 <strcat[m]> axx: you have to consider the possibility that it wasn't caused by the update
16:38:11 <strcat[m]> axx: I assume you hadn't rebooted since the last update
16:38:16 <strcat[m]> that seems likely
16:38:43 <strcat[m]> the default wallpaper was changed - that's it
16:38:52 <strcat[m]> we didn't add any code to change / update wallpapers
16:39:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Imagine rebooting, I never even reboot my workstation
16:39:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Linux: *adios*, kernel panic
16:39:06 <axx> so both my profile's wallpapers were set to a black background, just as the OS starts defaulting to a black wallpaper, and after i reboot from said update, but it's due to something else, and something that affects both my profiles?
16:39:17 <axx>  * so both my profiles' wallpapers were set to a black background, just as the OS starts defaulting to a black wallpaper, and after i reboot from said update, but it's due to something else, and something that affects both my profiles?
16:39:17 <strcat[m]> in fact if people had explicitly set it to the default they will still have that
16:39:41 <strcat[m]>  * in fact if people had explicitly set it to the previous default they will still have that
16:40:17 <strcat[m]> axx: we didn't override people's chosen wallpaper
16:40:20 <strcat[m]> you can see what we did in that change
16:40:24 <strcat[m]> we changed the default wallpaper png - that's it
16:40:31 <strcat[m]> you can look at all the changes in the code for that release
16:40:36 <strcat[m]> that is the only change we made to wallpapers
16:40:59 <strcat[m]> so yes, you're wrong to attribute anything but the default wallpaper changing to that update
16:41:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "not everyone has good eyesight"> Ah yes I know them, they're me
16:43:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway a bunch of time has been wasted that could have seen better use elsewhere
16:44:43 <strcat[m]> I know what I changed and this was pushed out via Beta with a lot of testing and then Stable
16:45:08 <strcat[m]> and you're the only person to say your custom configuration was replaced by us changing the default_wallpaper.png
16:45:21 <strcat[m]> and I don't see how it could happen
16:45:42 <strcat[m]> we made no code or configuration changes
16:45:43 <strcat[m]> all we did is replace default_wallpaper.png
16:45:48 <strcat[m]> so if it falls back to loading the default, it's a different default - that's it
16:45:58 <strcat[m]> if it wasn't already going to load the default, nothing has changed
16:46:02 <strcat[m]> all we changed is default_wallpaper.png
16:46:03 <axx> <anupritaisno1[m] "Anyway a bunch of time has been "> as no one was forced to enter in this conversation, and that i didn't even intend it to be blame-pointing in nature, that comment seems, again, a bit hypocritical and holier-than-thou
16:46:22 <strcat[m]> the code is identical
16:46:24 <strcat[m]> configuration is identical
16:46:27 <axx> i hear that
16:46:31 <axx> i see the logic
16:46:31 <strcat[m]> if it wasn't already going to load the default, this won't make it do that
16:46:35 <strcat[m]> the file has the same data, etc. too
16:46:46 <strcat[m]>  * the file has the same date, etc. too in the OS image
16:46:48 <axx> i understand we might not have an explanation
16:46:56 <axx> i'm just reporting what happened on my device
16:47:05 <axx> i have no interesting, nothing to gain by doing so
16:47:17 <strcat[m]> it wasn't caused by this change
16:47:18 <axx> i just wasn't expected to be met by such denial and patronising
16:47:26 <axx> it's a strange way to envision a community project
16:47:37 <strcat[m]> I know for a fact that it wasn't caused by this change
16:47:54 <taziden> strcat[m]: maybe another one seemingly unrelated?
16:48:01 <strcat[m]> if your configured wallpaper was lost that is a separate issue
16:48:09 <strcat[m]> and I don't think it has anything to do with that release
16:48:12 <strcat[m]> certainly not this change
16:48:38 <strcat[m]> we did not change any configuration / code to set the wallpaper, if the OS wasn't already deciding to load this file, it wouldn't impact anything
16:48:50 <strcat[m]> it only change anything for people where the OS was already going to load default_wallpaper.png
16:49:02 <obi[m]> <strcat[m] "I know for a fact that it wasn't"> Sorry to jump in here. I'm on the 4a - The default wallpaper now is black, like it should be, but the preview icon is the pink sky (not the preview, that's black). Is this normal? Not that I care, just curious
16:49:02 <axx> <strcat[m] "if your configured wallpaper was"> how is that a separate issue? that's exactly one of the effects of the issue i'm reporting: i had a custom wallpaper, after update i had a black wallpaper, my custom wallpaper is nowhere to be found
16:49:18 <strcat[m]> obi: probably a cached thumbnail in the app
16:49:30 <strcat[m]> obi: the app you're using to set the wallpaper
16:49:36 <obi[m]> <strcat[m] "obi: probably a cached thumbnail"> Thanks
16:49:37 <strcat[m]> since it probably makes thumbnails and the date of the file is the same
16:50:21 <strcat[m]> obi: where are you looking at it?
16:50:36 <strcat[m]> obi: Settings -> Display -> Wallpapers has all the options (any apps that say they can set it)
16:50:50 <deappledapple> But it is what it is, open source developer time is crucial for open source projects, unsure how is that "holier than thou"
16:50:50 <strcat[m]>  * obi: Settings -> Display -> Wallpaper has all the options (any apps that say they can set it)
16:50:51 <deappledapple> Oh well.
16:51:08 <obi[m]> <strcat[m] "obi: Settings -> Display -> Wall"> Just in the default wallpaper picker
16:51:19 <strcat[m]> axx: if your configured wallpaper was lost, that's a separate issue from us changing the default_wallpaper.png image
16:51:25 <strcat[m]> axx: it's unrelated
16:51:44 <axx> i may have undestood part of the issue: my custom wallaper was set by the app Muzei. I was able to get it back by trying to pick a wallpaper and compleing the action with "com.android.wallpaperpicker"
16:52:14 <axx> <strcat[m] "axx: if your configured wallpape"> what do you think i mean when i say i had a custom wallpaper?
16:52:17 <axx> i mean "not the default one"
16:52:30 <strcat[m]> yes and I'm saying this change could not have impacted that
16:52:42 <strcat[m]> if your configured wallpaper setting was lost, that is a separate issue
16:52:45 <axx> wait, so have you been denying what i was saying only to now say "oh that's totally possible"?
16:52:51 <strcat[m]> you're assuming it's related to us changing default_wallpaper.png but it isn't
16:53:00 <strcat[m]> axx: what you're saying is not possible
16:53:15 <axx> <strcat[m] "you're assuming it's related to "> no, i'm not, i didn' say that
16:53:16 <strcat[m]> changing default_wallpaper.png did not cause a user configured wallpaper to be discarded/ignored
16:53:26 <axx> people told me the black background was not a bug, it was teh new default
16:53:29 <strcat[m]> and that's all we did to change the default wallpaper
16:53:41 <axx> i initally just said my backgronud had been lost and set to black
16:53:58 <axx>  * i initally just said my background had been lost and set to black
16:54:05 <strcat[m]> if there's none configured or the configured one is inaccessible
16:54:07 <strcat[m]> it uses the default
16:54:30 <strcat[m]> and we changed the default png, but the OS doesn't look at that unless it has none configured
16:55:18 <strcat[m]> and there should never be a situation where it cannot load the default - that's near impossible unless the System UI code is broken, since it's loading it from the OS image and the default is part of the verified OS image, not something in data
16:55:22 <axx> It appears that this project is _so_defensive that it immediately tried to explain how the problem couldn't possibly the project's fault, rather than actually try to understand it. Could there be a lesson here for all the folks going "and look at how much time was wasted talking about this rather than reviewing PRs and coding, tutt tutt"?
16:55:35 <strcat[m]> don't understand what you mean
16:55:43 <axx>  * It appears that this project is _so_ defensive that it immediately tried to explain how the problem couldn't possibly the project's fault, rather than actually try to understand it. Could there be a lesson here for all the folks going "and look at how much time was wasted talking about this rather than reviewing PRs and coding, tutt tutt"?
16:55:46 <strcat[m]> you started criticizing the new default
16:55:55 <strcat[m]> that's when I saw the messages and entered the conversation
16:56:06 <taziden> that's not what happened
16:56:08 <strcat[m]> you started saying it was a bad choice as a default wallpaper and I disagree
16:56:11 <axx> you must have missed the begining of the conversation, because that was not my initial point
16:56:29 <strcat[m]> I wasn't here for the beginning of the conversation and random people in the channel that aren't developers don't represent the project
16:57:03 <taziden> 15:58:08 axx | i recently (latest update?) had the wallpaper on my different profiles get reset, is this a problem that others experienced too?
16:57:25 <taziden> that was the starting point; from there, it derailed :/
16:57:28 <strcat> 09:58:51         nscnt[m] | axx: The default wallpaper is black now.
16:57:33 <strcat> 10:03:25              axx | <nscnt[m] "axx: The default wallpaper is bl"> wow, are we trying to scare away users now? :)
16:57:35 <axx> <axx "i recently (latest update?) had "> To which nscnt said:
16:57:56 <strcat> he assumed that you mean the pink wallpaper was gone
16:58:22 <strcat> and the answer he gave is accurate and doesn't mean we changed anyone's wallpaper
16:58:41 <axx> no one tried to understand the issue, that was the answer. After i derided the choice of using the same background as when Android fails to load the wallpaper, things went that way.
16:59:02 <strcat> then you criticized our choice of default wallpaper at length and I responded to that
16:59:05 <axx> <strcat "he assumed that you mean the pin"> and to assume "is to make an ass of u and me" eh?
16:59:18 <strcat> and again we did not override any user settings
16:59:25 <taziden> axx: maybe you should just open an issue and call it a day? I don't think we'll have anything else more productive come out of it today
16:59:33 <axx> that's what i mean by no one really trying to grok the isuse. Essentially this was treated as "another stupid user, make him go away" i think.
16:59:47 <strcat> axx: nscnt[m] is another user of the channel
17:00:03 <strcat> you can't attribute what others said to me
17:00:07 <axx> <taziden "axx: maybe you should just open "> well i didn't want to report something if it was arleady a known issue, you know? Check, in order not to waste people's time.
17:00:10 <axx> Success that was!
17:00:27 <axx> <strcat "you can't attribute what others "> you'll be happy to hear that i'm not doing that, at all
17:00:28 <strcat> you jumped right to trying to criticize and make it seem like we did something misguided / bad
17:00:35 <strcat> and that's what I responded to
17:00:45 <strcat> your first reply to his response was like that
17:00:48 <strcat> and then you elaborated on it
17:01:03 <strcat> and that's when I saw it since there were 15+ messages criticizing something I changed
17:01:23 <strcat> and I defended what I did which is changing default_wallpaper.png to something better suiting the project
17:01:28 <axx> i did try to explain that the other thing i wanted to talk about was a separate issue
17:01:30 <strcat> which did NOT override anyone's configured wallpaper
17:01:59 <strcat> and as I explained above, I think it's a good choice as a default, and I definitely don't agree that it is any kind of usability issue
17:02:05 <strcat> or something that would cause confusion to new users
17:02:10 <nscnt[m]> I think everyone made their point, which should be fine now
17:02:26 <strcat> I'm aware that changing a default like this may be confusing to an existing user who is still using the default and therefore sees it change
17:02:40 <strcat> but it's in the release notes
17:02:50 <strcat> and can be changed to their preferred default
17:03:02 <strcat> if someone actually likes that pink wallpaper they can get it from GitHub
17:05:25 <axx> <strcat "which did NOT override anyone's "> My background changed after update. The OS did override my configured wallpaper.  It is splitting hairs to say "ah, we didn't override your configured wallpaper, but your configured wallpaper setting may have been lost"
17:05:36 <strcat> it wasn't caused by that change
17:05:39 <axx> which is, from what i can read in the messges posted here, what is being said
17:05:46 <strcat> the update didn't do that
17:06:08 <strcat> you say it happened after the update but that was also a reboot
17:06:21 <strcat> there isn't actually a reason to think the update had anything to do with it
17:06:31 <axx> am i mistaken to think that, to apply the update, one must reboot?
17:06:49 <strcat> yes, and you don't have a reason to think that the update caused it
17:07:05 <axx> because the OS does say "reboot to update" or something to that effect
17:07:14 <strcat> reboot to use the new OS version
17:07:26 <strcat> the update is essentially completed without that
17:07:30 <strcat> you just aren't using it
17:07:41 <strcat> if your phone lost power and then you charged it
17:07:47 <strcat> it'd boot up the current (new) version
17:07:48 <axx> are you being serious?
17:07:59 <axx> re-read what you have just said, and tell me how that is not splitting hairs
17:08:08 <strcat> changing default_wallpaper.png didn't override your configured setting
17:08:22 <strcat> it's extremely unlikely that the update had anything to do with whatever happened
17:08:27 <axx> if you can't see that, if you genuinely don't think that's hair-splitting, then that explains a lot of this conversation
17:08:30 <taziden> alright, we all got it now I think strcat
17:09:32 <taziden> axx: if it's not due to any changes in graphene, the most likely explanation is that your phone has been hacked somehow /s
17:09:44 <axx> this has been an rich and eye-opening conversation, thanks everyone!
17:09:48 <strcat> axx: I'm saying that if your wallpaper configuration was lost it was probably lost before and rebooting would have used the default regardless of us changing it
17:09:49 <axx> (i'm not even being sarcastic, i'm still fond of the project)
17:10:08 <axx> TheJollyRoger: thanks for being a beacon of friendliness on this ship !
17:10:09 <strcat> you would instead be complaining your wallpaper was changed to pink instead of black
17:10:23 <strcat> the update just changed what the fallback is
17:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> axx: Anytime!
17:11:07 <strcat> it really is this 1 commit https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/18b644c926562b1531876f7d7b922fee8290d9c7
17:11:12 <strcat> believe it or not
17:11:32 <strcat> and as you can see if you look in the OS images
17:11:44 <strcat> it ends up with the same dates on the file
17:11:45 <take_a_deep_brea> axx:  no need to pass judgement on people here on such a rare visit, please.
17:11:53 <strcat> which is why an image viewer wouldn't update a thumbnail
17:12:38 <strcat> image viewers have to be smart enough to know that for an image from the OS images, they need to check the OS version / build date, not the date on the file
17:12:48 <strcat> it's an edge case most apps probably don't handle
17:12:55 <strcat> the launcher app in the OS deals with it properly
17:12:58 <strcat> for app icons
17:13:12 <strcat> because OS updates usually don't increase app versionCode even if the app changes
17:14:11 <strcat> so it is somewhat expected for an image viewer to still show the pink wallpaper as a thumbnail if it generated the thumbnail before (when you previously looked at it)
17:14:34 <strcat> not ideal, but makes sense
17:14:53 <strcat> same thing would happen with an image elsewhere that is changed with the last mod date being kept the same
17:15:09 <take_a_deep_brea> axx:  its just that we are not used to spending ao much time on the choice of wallpaper and your case was a rare one indeed .
17:15:09 <take_a_deep_brea> heck, we dont even diacuss default web browser for this long, lmao.
17:15:33 <strcat> and the reason that's the case for the OS images is for reproducible builds / minimal deltas - it overrides all the file dates on the filesystem and in zips, etc. with a placeholder (not the build date, but rather a static placeholder hard-wired in AOSP)
17:17:15 <take_a_deep_brea> * axx:  its just that we are not used to spending so much time on the choice of wallpaper and your case was a rare one indeed .
17:17:16 <take_a_deep_brea> heck, we dont even discuss default web browser for this long, lmao.
17:18:24 <strcat> that's why if you look at stuff in the OS images it's all 2009-01-01 for the fs and zip entries
17:18:37 <strcat> UTC time
17:18:50 <strcat> so for me it shows it as 2008-12-31 19:00
17:46:54 <linxu> Hi there, can you get cursor keys on the graphene keyboard? It would help navigating a lot
17:51:20 <take_a_deep_brea> linxu:  you can try an alternative keyboard app example AnySoft keyboard.
17:52:05 <take_a_deep_brea> grapheneOS default keyboard cannot be configured to have cursor keys
17:53:11 <take_a_deep_brea> also be careful about the kind of permission any keyboard app asks for.
17:53:40 <take_a_deep_brea> in case you choose to install a different one.
18:07:30 <bugmenot00000[m]> Hi. I updated to the latest release while it was only available as beta. I'm still stuck with the aosp wallpaper. Is this expected? Am I being paranoid?
18:08:14 <deappledapple> Check first the build number
18:08:44 <take_a_deep_brea> bugmenot00000:  at any point did you set your wallpaper to the default aosp one ?
18:09:02 <bugmenot00000[m]> It's build RQ1A.210105.003.2021.01.05.03
18:09:16 <take_a_deep_brea> like in , change the wallpaper then change it back ?
18:10:07 <bugmenot00000[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "bugmenot00000:  at any point did"> I've do recall using other wallpapers, but eventually switched back to the aosp wallpaper
18:10:50 <strcat> bugmenot00000[m]: if you had explicitly switched to it
18:10:53 <strcat> then it's still available
18:10:55 <bugmenot00000[m]> According to the changelog: "replace default AOSP wallpaper with a solid black wallpaper - may get a bit fancier in the near future". I'm not seeing the new wallpaper
18:10:59 <strcat> we didn't override explicit choices
18:11:04 <strcat> we only changed the default
18:11:09 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
18:11:29 <strcat> if you explicitly selected the AOSP pink wallpaper before
18:11:31 <strcat> you will still have that
18:11:36 <strcat> because it's your configured wallpaper
18:11:46 <strcat> in the wallpaper app, I would expect that the new default shows up as an option
18:11:51 <strcat> (not gallery, the wallpaper app)
18:12:43 <bugmenot00000[m]> <strcat "in the wallpaper app, I would ex"> The pink wallpaper is still there, but that's the only one  available
18:13:03 <strcat> select it
18:13:04 <bugmenot00000[m]> The new one is nowhere to be seen/found
18:13:09 <strcat> the thumbnail may just not be updated
18:13:14 <strcat> explained this earlier
18:13:20 <bugmenot00000[m]> That did the trick
18:13:23 <bugmenot00000[m]> Thanks
18:13:39 <strcat> the wallpaper app generates thumbnails
18:13:42 <strcat> based on last modification date
18:13:54 <strcat> which doesn't ever change for files in the OS images (it's always 2009-01-01)
18:14:29 <strcat> so it doesn't realize it needs to make a new thumbnail
18:14:33 <strcat> you can clear app data for the wallpaper app
18:14:44 <bugmenot00000[m]> Got it
18:15:00 <strcat> they just didn't write it to handle the case that the default wallpaper changes
18:15:11 <strcat> since for other files, what they do is fine, since their last mod date will be newer
18:31:04 <banjo[m]> the wallpapers thing is getting to the level of subtle trolling already lol.
18:31:34 <banjo[m]> I mean c'mon it's a wallpaper
18:37:02 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
18:39:13 <take_a_deep_brea> i think in both the cases we witnessed today it was genuine concern that brought the people here. just that in the first case some unfortunate misunderstanding let to an exchange that was unusually long
18:45:05 <banjo[m]> well that's unfortunate and until the subtle pattern is implemented on top of the black wallpaper I'll return to the stock ROM.
18:53:07 <TheJollyRoger> I think sometime, what I'll try doing is seeing if I can fire up Blender again and see what I can figure out.
18:53:23 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe a nice, glossy carbon weave in deep dark gray with small silver highlights.
18:54:03 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah. that would be nice.
18:54:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The first one I sent in with the big floating hexagon, that one was a bit too tacky and too... gaudy? Plus, it was the logo behind the icons, which didn't sit well.
18:55:06 <blk> tbh my preference is the black wallpaper. Hardly iconic, though
18:55:51 <TheJollyRoger> Right now my wallpaper is actually a picture of a pirate ship, hehe, to nobody's surprise :P.
18:56:50 <take_a_deep_brea> i searched for 'hexagons in black background ' you could use some of those for inspiration
18:57:02 <banjo[m]> someone watched a bit to much Johnny deep
18:58:08 * banjo[m] uploaded an image: OcspC.jpg (26KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/FITnmMpucuNIrSiBGsgrSuyh/OcspC.jpg >
18:58:41 <banjo[m]> something along this lines. maybe even more subtle
18:59:19 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, a pattern of some sort, one that we could scale or tessellate.
18:59:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hey those look great.
19:00:07 <TheJollyRoger> And they're in 3D!!!
19:00:11 <take_a_deep_brea> https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.LKSYBgT_uOC0abG8So3RZQHaEK%26pid%3DApi&f=1
19:01:47 <TheJollyRoger> Really gonna have to learn blender hahahaha. Currently, I just use NX and Creo XD
19:02:17 <TheJollyRoger> (But NX and Creo is not designed for "pretty" rendering, it's designed for Constructive Solid Geometry, so it can be very cumbersome to make things look 'pretty' )
19:06:15 <take_a_deep_brea> well i sure did learn how much thought could go into just wallpapers...
19:06:29 <TheJollyRoger> None of it occurred to me, either!
19:09:41 <take_a_deep_brea> but it would be nice if a link to the changelog is made available as a notification after an update has been installed.
19:09:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Think I'll write that down...
19:10:28 <TheJollyRoger> "What's New In This Update..." sorta.
19:11:37 <TheJollyRoger> I can see why it would be best to direct to the website though, rather than simply try to fetch the updates and display it. If we direct it to the website we don't need to post the information twice, so there's less chance of a discrepancy occurring.
19:11:51 * TheJollyRoger thinks.
19:13:28 <take_a_deep_brea> i personally feel obligated to read the changelog as unlike other products ive used in the past im so much closer to the process of change that is taking place . not like a samsung stock OS where there is so much more opacity so no incentive and much less of a possibility for a user to know what changes in an update
19:14:44 <take_a_deep_brea> i was just echoing strcat's suggestion made somewhere in the above convo when that changelog thing came up.
19:21:36 <blk> I think a proper and separate subscription channel for announcements (e.g. mail list) would be far more appropriate.
19:25:45 <nscnt[m]> Open a browser with graphenos.org/releases and you're done
19:26:03 <nscnt[m]> * Open a browser with grapheneos.org/releases and you're done
19:26:41 <nscnt[m]> Or https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog directly
19:27:01 <take_a_deep_brea> nscnt: thats the best implementation . but there ia the issue where people neglect such things.
19:28:33 <nscnt[m]> We have announcements in EVERY channel and social media account GrapheneOS has
19:29:03 <take_a_deep_brea> well that is also true.
19:29:37 <nscnt[m]> + atom feed
19:34:08 <rheaalleen[m]> I might be wrong but weren't ringtone and notifications separate audio in the sound options?
19:34:40 <take_a_deep_brea> well just out of curiosity , how big a change would it be to have the seamless update client send a notification along the lines of :
19:34:41 <take_a_deep_brea> Update ready.Changelog : <url to the changelog >
19:36:09 <nscnt[m]> rheaalleen: They are. Do you see something different than I do?
19:47:54 <blk> nscnt: That should be sufficient then imo
20:18:35 <rheaalleen[m]> nscnt ring and notification are ties to the same slider for me
20:18:42 <rheaalleen[m]> tied*
20:20:34 <nscnt[m]> rheaalleen: Oh, the volume yea
20:20:52 <nscnt[m]> I thought you meant the sounds for it
20:44:02 <XenoProteins18> Hello
20:44:06 <XenoProteins18> I An XENOPROTEINS
20:44:13 <XenoProteins18> "Donate to Graphene OS" :)
20:47:08 <cx7dd[m]> Hey guys,
20:47:08 <cx7dd[m]> im currently trying to build grapheneOS from source. I'm stuck at "extracting vendor files for pixel" .
20:47:08 <cx7dd[m]> What is meant by "BUILD_ID"?
20:48:39 <XenoProteins18> Could be the Pixel Version number, or a device-specific identifier
20:48:52 <XenoProteins18> Why not just download and SHA256 hash-verify Graphene OS?
20:50:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> XenoProteins18: hashes are only a guarantee of integrity
20:50:51 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: the version numbers are $BUILD_ID.$BUILD_NUMBER where $BUILD_NUMBER for GrapheneOS is set based on a date
20:51:10 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: $BUILD_ID is the AOSP version
20:51:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Signify already uses sha256 internally and it is a guarantee of integrity as well as authenticity (the hash is signed)
20:51:25 <strcat[m]> so GrapheneOS versions contain the AOSP version they are based on
20:51:34 <cx7dd[m]> <strcat[m] "cx7dd: the version numbers are $"> Thank you!
20:51:58 <strcat[m]> signify's hash checking mode uses signed sha256 (or sha512)
20:52:07 <strcat[m]> but the normal mode just uses the ed25519 signature directly
20:52:08 <strcat[m]> no hash
20:52:18 <strcat[m]> but that uses memory equal to the size of the thing being signed/verified
20:52:20 <strcat[m]> not very practical
20:52:29 <strcat[m]> I think ideally it would just use a hash internally...
20:53:06 <XenoProteins18> I just verified the Hash with Signify, then ran Auditor app, and both signatures matched.
20:53:09 <XenoProteins18> Thats good enough for me
20:59:37 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: did you not like the name Anonydam?
21:01:31 <XenoProteins18> Ah yes But right now Im role-playing as an Alien
21:01:47 <XenoProteins18> Anonydam is my true name now
21:05:59 <NewUser> I have a question. Has anyone here ever actually found a benefit to autocomplete in anything they've ever owned . . . ever?
21:06:47 <sierocharlie[m]> <NewUser "I have a question. Has anyone he"> No. I do find use in word suggestions from time to time.
21:07:05 <NewUser> Suggestions, not forced changes, right?
21:08:09 <NewUser> Does anyone ever use Notepad++ and actually keep the autocomplete turned on while coding, only if you have to repeat something so many times that it's worth the constant delete and retype right?
21:08:20 <sierocharlie[m]> <NewUser "Suggestions, not forced changes,"> Exactly.
21:09:28 <NewUser> Okay, so I'm actually here to ask, why is autocomplete the default for everything? Why do we have to disable it on everything? Why can it not be that if we want it, we enable it, or it just stays off?
21:09:50 <XenoProteins18> Probably so you can type net and network shows up
21:09:54 <NewUser> Actually, that's not what I'm here to ask. I'm actually here to ask how we disable autocomplete in GrapheneOS
21:10:01 <XenoProteins18> Keyboard settings
21:10:37 <NewUser> Where is keyboard settings?
21:11:35 <NewUser> Okay, I found it
21:11:55 <XenoProteins18> Yes
21:12:04 <XenoProteins18> You can adjust auto-complete, suggestions etc
21:12:20 <NewUser> It's the GrapheneOS keyboard settings "Text Correction" options I think.
21:14:18 <NewUser> Thanks
21:14:50 <NewUser> Okay, so let me tell my story to all who are interested in learning what happened when I bought this Pixel 4a at bestbuy
21:15:06 <TheJollyRoger> Sure what's up NewUser ?
21:15:18 <XenoProteins18> Im ready
21:15:27 <NewUser> Okay, so I purchased the unlocked version without a plan.
21:15:53 <NewUser> I wanted to install GrapheneOS out of the box without even booting the Pixel up.
21:16:19 <XenoProteins18> Gotta update the firmware
21:16:23 <XenoProteins18> first
21:16:46 <strcat[m]> NewUser: you have to boot it to enable unlocking
21:16:50 <NewUser> I was going to try to update the firmware using the offline OTA download
21:16:50 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
21:17:18 <XenoProteins18> Yes OEM unlocking in developer settings
21:17:29 <NewUser> However, I could not unlock the bootloader without enabling OEM unlock in the developer settings.
21:17:31 <XenoProteins18> It only takes like 30 minutes from new phone to graphene
21:17:43 <sierocharlie[m]> ^
21:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's normal.
21:17:48 <sierocharlie[m]> I did it yesterday.
21:18:24 <NewUser> So, I thought, "No problem." However, this particular phone requires one to go online before it will allow the option of OEM unlocking.
21:18:41 <TheJollyRoger> It's a remarkably pragmatic step: don't let the user shoot themselves in the foot, but Google's given us a way for us "advanced users" to have the choice.
21:19:10 <NewUser> So, I did that, enabled OEM unlocking, and got into the bootloader.
21:20:45 <NewUser> Then I read through these install instructions. Oh my goodness, it wants you do all kinds of stuff, and there are at least two different places to download tools .You see, I was trying to do this all offline
21:21:16 <XenoProteins18> Its really easy
21:21:24 <XenoProteins18> Download Graphene, Signifiy, A few tools
21:21:29 <XenoProteins18> Its mostly just copy pasting commands
21:21:38 <XenoProteins18> We arn't coding a Self-Learning Ai here
21:21:42 <XenoProteins18> Its mostly just copy pasting commands
21:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> NewUser: well, you can do it offline, once you've obtained the correct versions of Fastboot, the factory images, and if you want, Signify.
21:24:53 <NewUser> At some point, I figured out that the tools I should be downloading are the ones linked from this page: https://developers.google.com/android/ota
21:25:30 <NewUser> Which lead you to here: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
21:26:04 <NewUser> Then due to my inexperience, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to compile this what I thought was source code.
21:26:41 <NewUser> No, it's just the programs. All I needed to do that I figured out at some point was ./fastboot or ./adb
21:26:50 <blk> So you want to build fastboot from source?
21:27:13 <NewUser> No, I just wanted the most recent versions without installing a bunch of crap or doing other stuff
21:27:32 <TheJollyRoger> NewUser: you won't have to install anything. It's self-contained, and runs from the directory you unpack it from.
21:27:33 <blk> The install guide links you directly to the standalone version. There is no installation.
21:28:06 <NewUser> Those zips provide the program and for some reason I didn't pay attention to the instructions that told me I can use bsdtar to unzip them. I figured that I could use that eventually too.
21:28:12 <TheJollyRoger> It includes everything you'll need in that zipfile except for udev rules for your operating system (if your operating system uses udev, or eudev, this applies to you.)
21:28:37 <NewUser> The path and udev, I didn't even need
21:29:08 <NewUser> Once it dawned on me that I had the full fastboot there in the zip file, and all I needed was to do ./ everything was easy from there.
21:30:04 <NewUser> I still had to look at how to run an executable when not in the same directory. Apparently, you just do the normal path to the executable then, and it still runs as thought you did the ./
21:31:06 <NewUser> So, because I was not in the mood at this point to go through how to get the bash script to run properly, I just opened it up with a text editor, took a picture, and then ran the commands within it by typing them out.
21:32:16 <blk> Sounds like you treated the install guide as a list of suggestions, and in the end made it much more difficult than it had to be. :-)
21:32:25 <NewUser> I didn't need to do path or udev, or any of the extra stuff. I just needed the image files provided by GrapheneOS install instructions, and to type out each command by hand running the fastboot executable.
21:34:27 <NewUser> blk, maybe. I didn't pay a lot of attention to them at first because I was just trying to figure out how to get the platform tools extracted and placed somewhere without going online. I downloaded stuff to another old smartphone to an SDcard and transferred it all that way.
21:35:34 <NewUser> I was working off of livecd of ArchLinux. I had tried others, but due to confusion and such, I tried different ones until I figured this stuff out trying it on ArchLinux.
21:35:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hohoho man. This is one of the craziest installation stories I've heard so far!
21:37:30 <NewUser> Oh yeah, and you're right TheJollyRoger, it's pretty straightforward, about as straightforward as the Nexus 5X, once I knew what I was doing. Except you have to go online to oem unlock the Pixel 4a, which I don't think I had to do with the Nexus.
21:38:00 <TheJollyRoger> Oh I see.
21:38:35 <NewUser> I mean, you don't have to go anywhere online. You just have to connect to the internet, otherwise the OEM unlock option stays greyed out.
21:39:06 <XenoProteins18> Thats so the NSA gets a location data point on you before you install your privacy OS
21:39:17 * TheJollyRoger cracks up.
21:39:32 <NewUser> Lol, XenoProteins18 that's actually what I was thinking too.
21:39:36 <sierocharlie[m]> 😂
21:40:00 <sierocharlie[m]> <XenoProteins18 "Thats so the NSA gets a location"> "Anti-theft"
21:40:11 <XenoProteins18> With stock Android, they can exploit the non-sandboxed baseband
21:40:16 <XenoProteins18> :O
21:40:43 <XenoProteins18> So when you connect to the internet real fast to enable OEM unlocking BOOM Over the Air 0Day exploit
21:41:08 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: Heh, well, just for reference, on Pixels, even the stock operating system, the modem and radios on the phone, even the GPU, the SSD, they're all separated from the host memory via memory management.
21:41:18 <XenoProteins18> Even the baseband?
21:41:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, even the baseband.
21:41:27 <XenoProteins18> ok good
21:41:31 <TheJollyRoger> Phones have had memory management since roughly 2012.
21:41:35 <XenoProteins18> Just a location Cell Tower ID data point then
21:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> So the thing is this:
21:41:55 <NewUser> Well, they had more than enough time to get all they needed because I actually decided to download the updates since I was already online anyway.
21:41:58 <TheJollyRoger> The radio, from its perspective, can only see what memory the driver in the host's kernel explicitly allows it to.
21:42:02 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, it just sees a memory management unit.
21:42:03 <TheJollyRoger> That's it.
21:42:52 <TheJollyRoger> The drivers in the Pixels are open source. There are no closed source drivers on the Pixels.
21:44:48 <TheJollyRoger> So, people who spread fear about "THE BACKDURR BASEBAND!!!!11" are really about ten years behind the times.
21:45:24 <XenoProteins18> *Puts on 2 Anonymous masks* "The drivers in the Pixels are open source." Mr Freeman
21:46:52 <TheJollyRoger> Now, don't get me wrong. Nothing's /perfect/. If there is a bug in the driver that could be exploited, or the driver is badly written, then this presesnts a danger. But whoever says "phones basebands can take control of them at any time! It's a backdoor!" is talking about phones from before 2012, and virtually all dumbphones.
21:47:27 <XenoProteins18> The old basebands are probably how the NSA could located 'off' phones, along with malware
21:48:22 <NewUser> Anyone concerned about the fact that the Pixel 4a doesn't have an external SDcard slot, mine came with an adapter for regular USB to be attached to the phone. It will read a USB stick drive or a SDCard reader USB adapter.
21:48:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. This is why GrapheneOS's raison d'etre is: to reduce the attack surface, make things more restrictive, improve memory safety, and mitigate exploits to protect against attempts to exploit the operating system!
21:49:13 <TheJollyRoger> NewUser: I don't think many phones these days have MicroSD card slots unfortunately. It's a feature I really miss :(
21:49:14 <XenoProteins18> *Anonymous mask now has 3 layers*
21:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: Hahahahahahahahaha
21:49:51 <NewUser> Yeah, that and a battery that can be easily removed/replaced.
21:50:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I miss the days where I could pop the battery out, put it in the charger, and replace it with a fresh one. For now though I just carry a 10000mAH fast charging powerpack.
21:51:48 <NewUser> Is there anyway to disable the screentouch sensitivity when the display is turned off by pressing the side button.
21:52:06 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know. Let me check.
21:52:16 <TheJollyRoger> mind you, I have the 4, not the 4a.
21:52:42 <TheJollyRoger> So if I pick my phone up, that will cause it to wake so it can switch on the LIDAR.
21:53:13 <NewUser> Many Android phones apparently turn their displays on when you touch the screen, and I find that kind of annoying because then it messes up stuff that I didn't intend to do.
21:53:43 <sierocharlie[m]> Is LTE only the same as 4g only?
21:54:09 <sierocharlie[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So if I pick my phone up, that w"> LIDAR?
21:54:59 <XenoProteins18> You can set it off
21:55:08 <XenoProteins18> The lift screen awakening
21:55:21 <XenoProteins18> 4g as a term can refer to an enhanced 3.5G technology
21:55:30 <XenoProteins18> CDMA or similar
21:55:35 <TheJollyRoger> sierocharlie[m]: yeah, the Pixel 4's facial recognition works by projecting a short-lived, but intense series of infrared dots onto your face when you look at it, and then mapping the contours of your face.
21:55:36 <XenoProteins18> LTE is distinctly LTE
21:55:49 <XenoProteins18> I covered my cameras and fingerprint reader
21:56:06 <sierocharlie[m]> <XenoProteins18 "LTE is distinctly LTE"> Right. I don't have the LTE option.
21:56:06 <TheJollyRoger> It's very similar to Laser Infrared Detection and Ranging.

21:56:31 <XenoProteins18> You can set LTE only mode in network settings
21:56:46 <sierocharlie[m]> Yeah, except that it isn't called LTE for me.
21:56:48 <XenoProteins18> If your carrier supports VoiceOverLTE, then calls and texts work too
21:56:53 <XenoProteins18> What does your phone say
21:56:56 <sierocharlie[m]> It supports LTE only
21:57:11 <TheJollyRoger> The facial recognition sensors are exclusive to the 4 and 4XL, but I think the 5 and 4a don't have it because it won't work if you are wearing a mask.
21:57:11 <XenoProteins18> Yeah ok
21:57:23 <sierocharlie[m]> <XenoProteins18 "What does your phone say"> My phone says what I just said. Where it is supposed to
21:57:29 <XenoProteins18> Does the Graphene OS have any Secure Delete feature
21:57:34 <NewUser> Thank TheJollyRoger, XenoProteins18 It's in the display settings Lock Screen settings, "Tap to check phone" "Lift to check phone"
21:57:46 <XenoProteins18> Such as secure overwrite deleted messages
21:57:54 <XenoProteins18> or does reformatting actually overwrite with 0s, etc
21:58:10 <TheJollyRoger> NewUser: oh whew, awesome!
21:58:13 <XenoProteins18> Does Graphene have any Anti-Forensics?
21:58:25 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: What do you mean by "Anti-Forensics?"
21:58:47 <TheJollyRoger> Since those UFED machines only work if the phone is unlocked, or they haven't been patched to or are vulnerable to an exploit.
21:58:55 <XenoProteins18> When I reformat, does the old data get 0 zerod out
21:59:02 <XenoProteins18> Or when I delete messages, are they overwritten
21:59:08 <XenoProteins18> To prevent data forensics/recovery
21:59:12 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: when you factory reset, the security chip will change its tokens.
21:59:18 <XenoProteins18> Hmm
21:59:23 <TheJollyRoger> The data is permanently gone at that point.
21:59:23 <XenoProteins18> What does that security chip do?
21:59:27 <XenoProteins18> Ok nice
21:59:29 <TheJollyRoger> Just as effectively as if you had zeroed it out.
21:59:38 <XenoProteins18> Is that a Pixel feature or Graphene doing
21:59:39 <TheJollyRoger> They'd need to break AES to recover the data.
21:59:44 <TheJollyRoger> It's standard to Pixels.
21:59:47 <XenoProteins18> nice
22:00:08 <XenoProteins18> Can you link me to the documentation on that feature?
22:00:12 <TheJollyRoger> We allow you to use a longer password than normal, if you want some extra assurance that even if the access token were recover,d that you could fall back to the strength of the password.
22:00:28 <TheJollyRoger> The security chip is actually quite a big part of the package, let me get you a bit of info on it...
22:00:29 <XenoProteins18> That would need to be a long passphrase now
22:00:43 <XenoProteins18> I use a 140+ character passphrase on my laptop
22:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> You can go up to 64 characters. I like to use a word passphrase, since it's easier to remember, but hard to guess.
22:01:03 <XenoProteins18> yes
22:01:04 <XenoProteins18> diceware style
22:01:19 <NewUser> XenoProteins18  If the data is already encrypted, unless the people trying to get that data have the encryption key, the data is as though it has been wiped. Although, there are probably apps.
22:01:28 <XenoProteins18> With NSA Supercomputers, a simple PIN password would be cracked within a few hours
22:01:38 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption NewUser XenoProteins18 this is the stuff about it.
22:01:57 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: this is what the security chip is for:
22:02:20 <TheJollyRoger> *Among other things, Google recognized that people would likely only be using 6 digit pincodes for their passwords, so...
22:03:05 <XenoProteins18> Yeah my PIN is only 8
22:03:07 <TheJollyRoger> This is why we have Weaver.
22:03:54 <TheJollyRoger> The security chip has its own timer within itself, it doesn't answer to the host.
22:04:11 <Thatcher[m]> <XenoProteins18 "I use a 140+ character passphras"> 140? Holy moly
22:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> So if it recieves more than 30 failed attempts at the passcode, the chip will start to enforce progressively lengthening delays.
22:04:46 <TheJollyRoger> After about 140, it will only permit one attempt at the weaver token every 24 hours.
22:05:13 <TheJollyRoger> At this rate, exhausting the space of a relatively short, but perfectly random 4 digit pincode would take several hundred years, assuming it's not something easily guessed like your birth year or birthday.
22:05:32 <TheJollyRoger> of a random 4-6 digit pincode
22:05:45 <XenoProteins18> Yes
22:05:56 <NewUser> My suspicious nature needs somebody to go do some really illegal stuff phone, wipe it, and then let the FBI or CIA get their phone and see if they get convicted or even arrested.
22:05:56 <XenoProteins18> Its a really long movie title, with numbers and special characters, repeated 3 times.
22:06:10 <XenoProteins18> I mean
22:06:15 <XenoProteins18> We can estimate the capabilities
22:06:43 <XenoProteins18> Yes but mostly the pin data is just cloned
22:06:51 <XenoProteins18> then flashed onto 10,000 VPSs images
22:06:55 <XenoProteins18> then they just brute force
22:07:05 <XenoProteins18> and the origional key is on the phone and therefore never gets reset
22:07:26 <TheJollyRoger> Well, XKCD comes readily to mind here,
22:07:31 <XenoProteins18> If you store images of drugs for example, then wipe the phone, try to do image recovery
22:07:40 <TheJollyRoger> Rubber hose cryptanalysis, and all.
22:07:42 <XenoProteins18> Yes but you can just claim its a stolen phone
22:07:48 <XenoProteins18> Or a Ex-s phone
22:07:52 <NewUser> I don't think the pin matters because I didn't see anywhere where it said the pin is used for any of the data encryption.
22:08:05 <XenoProteins18> But the pin protects access to the data
22:08:23 <TheJollyRoger> XenoProteins18: be sure to read that entry on Weaver.
22:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> It will explain how it works better than I can.
22:08:29 <XenoProteins18> "Its my friends phone and I dont know the passphrase"
22:08:51 <sierocharlie[m]> <XenoProteins18 "You can set LTE only mode in net"> LTE equals 4g only on my pixel 4a with Graphene?
22:09:00 <XenoProteins18> LTE is LTE only
22:09:06 <sierocharlie[m]> It is in exactly the same place as where it says LTE only on  another phone.
22:09:08 <XenoProteins18> Somtimes '4g' can be 3g technology
22:09:19 <XenoProteins18> Just set LTe only and see if calls work
22:09:27 <XenoProteins18> if so, i suggest sticking with LTE only mode
22:09:50 <NewUser> Yeah, if they can brute force the pin without wiping the phone, so what we need is something that will wipe the phone after 5 wrong pin entries . . . or something like that . . . I mean maybe if we were Snowden.
22:09:50 * sierocharlie[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tYudMBLkqJFoprnqmGZimQLk/message.txt >
22:10:07 <NewUser> or Assange
22:10:18 <r0tt0r[m]> btw am i the only one having the 4g call issue or is this still in progress?
22:10:48 <XenoProteins18> They just clone the Phone
22:10:58 <XenoProteins18> Then the can spawn 100,000 Images and just brute force the key
22:11:02 <NewUser> Oh right.
22:11:03 <TheJollyRoger> NewUser: The reason for the "10 and wipe" was because back then, phones didn't have Weaver or hardware backed encryption like they do now.
22:11:12 <r0tt0r[m]> <NewUser "Yeah, if they can brute force th"> reboot when already unlocked and then timely lock till next try which will double each time
22:11:20 <XenoProteins18> Cops will rarely try to manually brute force a pin
22:11:21 <TheJollyRoger> It was a way to skirt the limitations of phones at the time.
22:11:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> NewUser: there is no way to "wipe" a phone without also making it look like there is a wipe going on
22:11:35 <XenoProteins18> Turn on Pin Scrambling if using a PIN
22:11:37 <TheJollyRoger> Weaver makes this unnecessary.
22:11:39 <XenoProteins18> PassPHrase is best though
22:11:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> The only way to wipe it would be to probably send a wipe request to the titan m while the system is running
22:11:54 <XenoProteins18> Could just have the phone look off while its wiping.
22:12:07 <NewUser> anupritaisno1[m] I guess it depends on the wiping program. The fact that you have encryption alone makes the data inaccessible to anyone without the encryption key.
22:12:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> NewUser: no, it doesn't
22:12:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Read the issue tracker, I'm not going to waste time explaining something already explained
22:12:46 <NewUser> anupritaisno1[m] Without the key, how do they access the encrypted data?
22:13:01 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back in a bit.
22:13:42 <NewUser> If there are vulnerabilities, that's beside the point. I'm talking about in general.
22:28:58 <mynacol[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The drivers in the Pixels are op"> Does this mean porting the device to a new Linux kernel is _relatively speaking_ easier?

23:48:08 <HoGiHung> is that what you meant?
23:49:28 <Pratyush[m]> yes now check your bootloader is unlocked or not and run fastboot version “fastboot version” without quote to make sure you have latest fastboot
23:50:47 <HoGiHung> ok so that command needs the phone to be connected then
23:51:07 <Pratyush[m]> nah
23:51:49 <Pratyush[m]> I mean no it's check your pc fastboot installation version it need to be at list 28+
23:52:16 <HoGiHung> rgr
23:52:19 <HoGiHung> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
