01:19:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hello
01:25:15 <banjo[m]> is there a way to randomise the imei the same way mac is randomized, for more privacy?
01:28:13 <squarmkt[m]> <banjo[m] "is there a way to randomise the "> Don't think so
01:28:15 <strcat[m]> banjo: no, and that wouldn't give you more privacy without further features anyway
01:28:30 <strcat[m]> it's not the only identifier
01:28:38 <strcat[m]> recommend reading our documentation on Wi-Fi anonymity
01:28:53 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
01:29:15 <strcat[m]> MAC randomization does not provide Wi-Fi anonymity alone
01:29:36 <strcat[m]> also need the other changes that were made to drivers/firmware and the OS
01:29:52 <strcat[m]> and of course if you do identifying things over the network that would negate it
01:30:04 <strcat[m]> so, VPN recommended
01:30:29 <strcat[m]> and read the documentation on default connections which covers how to blend in with standard Android devices
01:30:42 <strcat[m]> need to switch to the Google connectivity check URLs (even when using a VPN)
01:30:46 <strcat[m]> via our toggle
01:35:08 <ddddxd[m]> the latest version of graphene says it’s from 2020 and I’m on 2021 stock firmware. Do I need to wait for a 2021 graphene release to flash it or could i do 2020 graphene on 2021 stock
01:38:20 <louipcm> just do latest grapheneos from latest stock update
01:38:52 <ddddxd[m]> alright i will
01:43:01 <strcat[m]> ddddxd: the install guide covers everything
01:43:25 <strcat[m]> the January release just came out hours ago
01:43:37 <ddddxd[m]> oh
01:43:38 <strcat[m]> a new release coming out doesn't impact installation
01:43:53 <ddddxd[m]> thx
01:44:07 <strcat[m]> the guide recommends being on the latest stock OS to avoid issues with older firmware versions during flashing
01:44:10 <strcat[m]> still applies
01:44:44 <banjo[m]> i was thinking more along the lines of anonymity from the ISP. as long as  the phone is connected to the network it's identified by imei+sim. the ISP logs all the movement patterns, the internet connections and calls/sms. the second part can be mitigated by a VPN, while the first by a new prepaid sim and, in theory by a new random imei. is there a way to do that? o don't know of this is off topic if so sorry for the
01:44:44 <banjo[m]> derailment.
01:45:12 <strcat[m]> banjo: covered in the FAQ
01:45:33 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
01:45:58 <strcat[m]> banjo: and again I recommend reading the Wi-Fi section including the linked article to understand that MAC randomization (and similarly what you're proposing) does not provide anonymity alone
01:46:17 <strcat[m]>  * banjo: and again I recommend reading the Wi-Fi privacy section including the linked article to understand that MAC randomization (and similarly what you're proposing) does not provide anonymity alone
01:47:33 <strcat[m]> MAC randomization is part of the overall implementation of Wi-Fi anonymity which requires the Wi-Fi hardware/firmware/driver to support that
01:47:49 <strcat[m]> there are usually other identifiers and changing the MAC does not impact those
01:47:59 <strcat[m]> the same thing applies to what you're talking about
01:48:36 <strcat[m]> you're assuming that if it was possible to change the IMEI, that doing it and using a new SIM card would be enough to appear to be a different device but you don't know that
01:48:43 <strcat[m]> there are likely other identifiers
01:49:00 <strcat[m]> and it's not possible to change it
01:49:08 <strcat[m]> we have an FAQ section on it
01:57:30 <banjo[m]> I've read it and I didn't find more information on what those other identifiers might be and how they work. feom my understranding there are also legal issues with imei spoofing in some countries. using airplane mode + WiFi, a VPN,  a cheap 4g hotspot, prepaid sim and changing all but the first from time to time might be the best way of hiding from the ISP?
01:59:40 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking covers the topic
01:59:44 <strcat[m]> don't have more to add here
01:59:50 <strcat[m]> already written for the FAQ
02:00:53 <strcat[m]> banjo: the reason I am recommending reading the Wi-Fi section is so that you can read about what else had to be changed there (randomized probe sequence numbers, minimal probe information rather than having hardware info, anonymous DHCP in the OS, other things)
02:01:18 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
02:01:53 <strcat[m]> the MAC address is not the only device identifier that needs to be handled for Wi-Fi
02:02:23 <strcat[m]> banjo: a cellular hotspot will have an IMEI and other identifiers too, don't see how that's going to help you
02:03:06 <strcat[m]> are you going to buy a new SIM and cellular hotspot for each time you connect?
02:11:21 <banjo[m]> well I could just sell the hotspot after a few moths and get another cheap one. can't think of a better solution.
02:11:21 <banjo[m]> thank you for your help and sorry for the trouble. i will reread the whole section and do further research on the thinks you pointed out.
02:12:07 <strcat[m]> if you ever use the same SIM in the new hotspot it would be tied to the old one
02:12:14 <strcat[m]> and vice versa
02:12:19 <strcat[m]> so it only makes sense to cycle them together
02:12:34 <ddddxd[m]> just got graphene i am stoked. Appreciate ur guys help & patience
02:17:15 <banjo[m]> once every 3 months let's say I get new hotspot, a new sim and a new VPN, last two prepaid.
02:24:04 <banjo[m]> again thanks for all the help and great work.
03:10:54 <Brian88> Hello everyone was wondering if someone could help me out?
03:11:05 <strcat[m]> sure, ask the question
03:12:28 <Brian88> I am installing GrapheneOs on a pixel 4 A everything is working fine till I click the Flash-all.bat. a new Cdrom window pops up for a second but nothing loads?
03:12:54 <strcat[m]> you're not supposed to click that
03:13:05 <strcat[m]> start over following the official instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install
03:13:33 <strcat[m]> we don't support unofficial instructions like whatever you're following instead, you need to contact the creator of the unofficial instructions rather than this channel
03:13:55 <Brian88> I did do it your way and I get an error
03:13:57 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend following the official instructions to avoid screwing up your computer or the phone
03:14:10 <strcat[m]> Brian88: follow the official guide at https://grapheneos.org/install, it will work if you follow it
03:14:14 <strcat[m]> Brian88: if you get stuck, ask for help here
03:14:21 <Brian88> C:\Users\PC-Scan\Desktop\Grapheneos Pixel\platform-tools\sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03>./flash-all.bat
03:14:32 <strcat[m]> nope
03:14:44 <strcat[m]> that's not the official guide instructions
03:14:54 <strcat[m]> remove that directory you created
03:14:54 <Brian88> ok
03:15:04 <strcat[m]> start over following https://grapheneos.org/install from the top
03:15:14 <strcat[m]> do exactly what it says, don't deviate from it
03:15:18 <strcat[m]> don't do anything it doesn't say to do
03:15:26 <Brian88> ok
03:15:31 <Brian88> ty
03:15:47 <strcat[m]> the official instructions would never have you ending up with the factory images inside the platform-tools directory
03:16:08 <strcat[m]> and it's an indication that you downloaded platform-tools and the factory images your own way and don't have env:Path set up per the instructions
03:16:21 <strcat[m]> so, you need to just remove that and start over, doing it as the instructions say
03:16:29 <strcat[m]> copy-pasting exactly the commands it tells you to use will work
03:16:45 <strcat[m]> you have sunfish so you can literally copy-paste every command, 0 edits, and it will work
03:17:22 <strcat[m]> start at the top where it says to open a terminal https://grapheneos.org/install#opening-terminal
03:17:37 <strcat[m]> you're just supposed to open it from the start menu, not in a specific directory (and you aren't supposed to have downloaded anything, etc.)
03:18:20 <strcat[m]> so it has 1 command to run to make curl usable, then 3 commands to obtain, verify and extract platform-tools, 1 command to add it to env:Path
03:18:20 <Brian88> ok
03:18:33 <strcat[m]> then it has you check that fastboot works (without changing directory at any point)
03:18:38 <Brian88> ive done it like 4 ways at this point
03:18:52 <strcat[m]> the official guide is the only supported way and works reliably when followed
03:19:06 <strcat[m]> it's unfortunate that there are so many misguided / incorrect unofficial guides
03:19:13 <strcat[m]> not much we can do about that and we don't support them
03:19:36 <strcat[m]> recommend contacting the people who make those guides and asking them to either update them to follow the current official instructions or remove them since they're causing harm to people trying to install
03:19:42 <Brian88> yeah ok will try that thanks so much
03:19:42 <strcat[m]> I recommend that everyone in this channel does that
03:24:42 <Brian88> so i copy this to the command line? Remove-Item Alias:Curl
03:24:57 <Brian88> well with the .exe
03:29:07 <strcat[m]> Brian88: copy the command as given there
03:29:11 <strcat[m]> for each command it says to run
03:29:26 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't change anything - none of the commands should be skipped, modified, reordered, etc.
03:29:31 <strcat[m]> and no commands that are not listed there should be run
03:29:37 <strcat[m]> only do what it says there
03:29:45 <strcat[m]> it says when to connect the phone, etc. too
03:29:54 <strcat[m]> if you follow exactly what it says it will work
03:30:09 <strcat[m]> the only thing people need to change is the device name but you have the device that's used as an example so you don't
03:31:03 <strcat[m]> I made a video a while ago showing the installation process which was just a video of pasting the commands given here into a terminal with the results shown - could make another, but doesn't really seem particularly helpful (maybe to help convince people they really should follow what it says?)
03:43:12 <louipcm> lol nice
03:43:22 <strcat[m]> Brian88: it's quite possible you won't actually need any help
03:43:31 <louipcm> is it on youtube
03:43:49 <strcat[m]> usually the issue is that people doubted the official guide or their ability to follow it - but it only makes it harder to try to do something else
03:44:24 <louipcm> people tend to skip ahead/skim instead of carefully read it too
03:44:37 <strcat[m]> it has been made more clear over time
03:44:40 <strcat[m]> and more to the point
03:44:43 <louipcm> thats the only explanation i can imagine
03:44:53 <strcat[m]> it really covers everything
03:45:02 <strcat[m]> even tells you to connect the phone now
03:45:29 <strcat[m]> I think the only thing left to make clearer is that the blocks with multiple commands are multiple commands to run
03:45:47 <Brian88> my issue is i've not messed with paths and command line in forever so the instructions are confusing
03:45:58 <strcat[m]> Brian88: you can just copy paste though
03:45:58 <louipcm> maybe next step is graphics/pictures
03:46:03 <strcat[m]> you don't need to understand what you're doing
03:46:10 <strcat[m]> it is good if you do, but not at all required
03:46:14 <strcat[m]> no modifications to it are needed
03:46:37 <louipcm> well... i guess next step really is full installer
03:46:45 <strcat[m]> yes, a WebUSB-based installer
03:46:58 <louipcm> with graphical cues where needed
03:47:07 <strcat[m]> yeah that's the plan
03:47:12 <Brian88> well like fast boot it says i need to obtain it but where do i get it
03:47:19 <strcat[m]> Brian88: it says how
03:47:29 <strcat[m]> the section is a guide on doing it
03:47:32 <louipcm> Brian88:  it has the command to enter in terminal
03:47:35 <strcat[m]> it gives the exact commands you need to run to obtain it
03:47:41 <Brian88> ok
03:47:51 <strcat[m]> for Windows it says
03:48:29 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
03:48:31 <strcat[m]> it explains it there
03:48:47 <strcat[m]> it has 3 commands to run for Windows (download, verify, extract) and then 1 more command to add it to Path
03:48:57 <strcat[m]> you need to run exactly what it says with no modifications
03:49:10 <strcat[m]> and then `fastboot --version` will work (covered in the next section)
03:49:13 <Brian88> ok so its in the standaloneplatform tools
03:49:39 <strcat[m]> you just need to go through what it says and run exactly the commands it says to run
03:49:41 <strcat[m]> and it will work
03:49:51 <strcat[m]> trying to come up with your own way doing it is when it will go wrong
03:49:56 <strcat[m]> and listening to unofficial guides is a mistake
03:50:01 <strcat[m]> they are all wrong
03:50:55 <strcat[m]> there is no third party content that matches the up-to-date official guide
04:23:46 <gideonstorms[m]> Hi All, is it safe to use apkpure on grapheneOS?
04:24:08 <strcat[m]> doesn't really seem like a question about GrapheneOS
04:24:38 <strcat[m]> recommend using Aurora Store to get apps from the Play Store
04:25:10 <thematrix5000[m]> I got orbot from apkpure that's it though
04:25:21 <strcat[m]> we can't speak to whether third party sites mirroring apks are trustworthy
04:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> <gideonstorms[m] "Hi All, is it safe to use apkpur"> Please go to OT and yes it is relatively safe, still better to get it from play store
04:25:47 <gideonstorms[m]> thanks for the advice
04:26:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> gideonstorms: apkpure might be legit but most apps will require you to install their market
04:26:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> And they do have invasive ads
04:26:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mostly because apps now have split apks
04:27:06 <gideonstorms[m]> ok I wanted to check because I cannot get a lot of apps from aurora store. At least they did not show up in my search
04:27:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> gideonstorms: use Google search to search for the app
04:27:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then open the link in aurora store
04:27:58 <gideonstorms[m]> ok
04:28:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> gideonstorms: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
04:32:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Reactions to messages should just be disabled
04:32:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idk I just hate emoji
04:34:33 <ayaen_t[m]> i hear ya
04:42:56 <Brian88> Thanks for all your help guys
04:44:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Brian88: done?
04:44:37 <rny> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1346314515739238405
04:45:17 <strcat[m]> I also think it would be possible to use WebUSB to flash one phone with another
04:45:24 <rny> haha, what a time we live in, installing using web is more trustworthy than user-initiated verification
04:45:26 <strcat[m]> if sites are allowed to use that much space on mobile Chromium
04:45:42 <strcat[m]> rny: well if people really wanted they could download a local copy of the site and run it from the files
04:45:51 <strcat[m]> we could have a signed release of the website
04:46:02 <strcat[m]> WebUSB just makes so much more sense for dealing with this
04:46:09 <strcat[m]> avoid dealing with all these nonsense broken platforms
04:46:20 <strcat[m]> I think it's easier than I expected to implement too
04:46:24 <strcat[m]> the fastboot protocol is really simple
04:46:47 <strcat[m]> I don't expect it would take more than a day of work for someone
04:47:06 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/fastboot/README.md
04:47:22 <Brian88> yes
04:47:22 <strcat[m]> maybe I'll just do it myself if no one is interested

10:35:41 <strcat[m]> it's not a safe device to use
10:35:46 <strcat[m]> you're overcomplicating it
10:36:14 <strcat[m]> we're going to be releasing another OS update or two but the security patch level is 2020-11-01 for good due to lack of firmware updates
10:39:02 <mpelley92[m]> <strcat[m] "we're going to be releasing anot"> I understand. I will have to just bite the bullet and save up for a Pixel 4a 😁
10:39:25 <strcat[m]> no
10:39:50 <strcat[m]> a lot of information is available on the site
10:39:53 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
10:41:28 <mpelley92[m]> Oops, skimmed over that part about firmware support a little too fast 🙃
10:42:35 <mpelley92[m]> I'm glad the GrapheneOS team has high standards :D
10:43:11 <strcat[m]> there is no longer a source of updates for either firmware or OS device specific code, and 0 people have stepped up to do maintenance of the devices
10:43:15 <strcat[m]> but regardless, it's not possible to get past the 2020-11-01 security level
10:43:21 <strcat[m]> no amount of work put into it will do that
10:44:15 <strcat[m]> it's not a device that can be made secure anymore, it's just like the vast majority of devices that never get proper updates in the first place now
10:44:47 <strcat[m]> the 2020-11-05 patch level requires updates to the GPU firmware, etc.
10:44:58 <strcat[m]> not available, not developed by Qualcomm
10:45:14 <mpelley92[m]> I understand. It's sounds like quite a big undertaking, it makes sense to move onto the next device that is supported.
10:45:35 <strcat[m]> to be clear no amount of work will raise it beyond the 2020-11-01 patch level
10:45:49 <strcat[m]> giving us 2 million dollars to try to secure it will not change anything
10:46:05 <mpelley92[m]> 😅 I mean, if I had that money....
10:46:23 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to continue doing OS updates for it and we may do more
10:47:00 <strcat[m]> but they won't have full security updates for device support code in the OS without substantial resources that are not available (a dozen full time developers specifically to support the Pixel 2 - not happening)
10:47:22 <strcat[m]> and... there aren't going to be firmware updates not matter how many resources are dedicated to it
10:47:29 <strcat[m]>  * and... there aren't going to be firmware updates no matter how many resources are dedicated to it
10:47:51 <strcat[m]> and it's really fairly pointless to fix some subset of the vulnerabilities while still having serious ones disclosed in November forever with no way to fix them
10:48:07 <strcat[m]> it's pretty serious to not have proper GPU containment and isolation between programs
10:48:18 <strcat[m]> and it requires a firmware update that doesn't exist
10:48:34 <strcat[m]> among other issues
10:48:59 <strcat[m]> it's only going to keep building up, there is a lot of work on auditing / hardening the Qualcomm SoC, mostly internal research/engineering work by Qualcomm
10:49:06 <strcat[m]> and that SoC is now out of scope for it
10:49:11 <mpelley92[m]> That is a good point, will not disagree there. Your explanation definitely helps create more understanding for just how much effort is put into the security aspect in and of itself.
10:49:19 <strcat[m]> you can look at their monthly bulletins, most of the vulnerabilities are found by them internally
10:49:30 <strcat[m]> and the Pixel 2 isn't getting ANY of that anymore
10:49:59 <strcat[m]> https://www.qualcomm.com/company/product-security/bulletins/november-2020-security-bulletin
10:50:05 <strcat[m]> here is the 1st round it didn't get
10:50:30 <mpelley92[m]> That's actually pretty interesting to know too. I have to ask, how did you specifically become interested in developing and security?
10:51:07 <mpelley92[m]> I'm interested because I want to know if it's something that anyone can learn on the side, and help with teams like GrapheneOS.
10:51:11 <strcat[m]> we'll be doing an update with a few more kernel fixes and the userspace fixes but it's still not going to have the full November update and it's just not possible to do it
10:51:21 <strcat[m]>  * we'll be doing an update with a few more kernel fixes and the device independent userspace fixes but it's still not going to have the full November update and it's just not possible to do it
10:51:38 <strcat[m]>  * we'll be doing an update with a few more kernel fixes, a few more device support code fixes for userspace / firmware and the device independent userspace fixes but it's still not going to have the full November update and it's just not possible to do it
10:52:41 <strcat[m]> and after that, there are simply no more firmware updates available, no upstream maintenance of device support code, etc.
10:54:05 <mpelley92[m]> Now I definitely won't be using my old Pixel 2 for anything other than offline maps and a bluetooth media player ha!
11:01:02 <fivndim3[m]> So a while back i dropped here an issue with mint mobile and graphene  that there just wasnt any service when i tried to activate the sim.
11:01:03 <fivndim3[m]> Wanted to drop a solution if anyone runs into the same issue.
11:03:11 <fivndim3[m]> Turns out that if your nearest cell tower is going through an outage, the sim will fail to fully sync to the mothership because your activating from the web.
11:04:03 <fivndim3[m]> From there because it failed the sim connection will go into a limbo mode called purged and just cant be activated
11:05:17 <fivndim3[m]> the solution is to get a new sim but rest assured its not because Mint doesnt gel with graphene
11:26:21 <lasseter[m]> Looking for best practices for a balance of security and usability when it comes to using multiple user profiles on the same device (Settings -> System -> Advanced -> Multiple Users).  Is it better to keep the Owner profile almost untouched and use a user profile for my primary environment?  I was guessing that would be the case, but I notice that Termux refuses to run on anything other than the Owner profile.
11:29:16 <lasseter[m]> The Termux issue by itself is not the end of the world for me.  I just want to make sure I'm not taking a path I'll regret later (in terms of reconfig time).
11:37:39 <strcat[m]> Termux is broken and hard-wires a path in a way that breaks it in secondary profiles
11:37:41 <strcat[m]> most apps don't have issues like that
11:43:53 <strcat[m]> lasseter: for maximum security, our recommendation (as mentioned in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption) is using a secondary profile as your main one simply because that way you can unlock the device to use it without unlocking your main profile
11:44:16 <strcat[m]> lasseter: and you can end the session on the lockscreen via the end session button we enable (or with the global power menu) rather than needing to reboot
11:44:22 <strcat[m]> to purge the encryption keys fully
11:44:41 <strcat[m]> rather than only having stuff at rest that's encrypted with a keystore key set to be unavailable when locked by the app
11:47:35 <lasseter[m]> <strcat[m] "Termux is broken and hard-wires "> Seriously you guys rock.  Thanks.  So far my transition from iOS to Graphene has been nothing but amazement.
11:48:36 <strcat[m]> there's probably a way for Termux to avoid hard-wiring the path that way
11:48:58 <strcat[m]> it doesn't change at runtime, it only varies between profiles
12:18:12 <strcat[m]> January release going pretty well so far
12:18:47 <strcat[m]> 5/7 device builds done (assuming they pass testing)
12:21:23 <ayaen_t[m]> woohoo
12:23:20 <ayaen_t[m]> so the only way devices get supported for longer with proper security updates is if the people who make the device firmware keep working on it.
12:23:54 <ayaen_t[m]> and keep fixing bugs found in it
12:50:35 <elchupacabra420[> that means its utopian to believe these firmwares will be 100% bugfree one day like -say- a modern airliner flight management system so they could be left alone forever?
12:56:45 <jpds> elchupacabra420[: Since when were flight management systems bug free?
12:59:51 <mpelley92[m]> cough Boeing cough
12:59:51 <elchupacabra420[> Since passing FAA qualification hopefully.
13:01:06 <elchupacabra420[> these guys just approved themselves anyway :p
13:01:41 <strcat[m]> elchupacabra420: not having bugs in normal operation is a lot different than being secure against adversaries attacking them through substantial attack surface
13:02:16 <strcat[m]> and being secure doesn't require being bug free in that situation - that's pretty unrealistic - but rather not having exploitable bugs
13:02:41 <strcat[m]> it's not very realistic to do that by writing huge amounts of code in C and C++
13:03:31 <jpds> elchupacabra420[: Passing a certification in no shape or form means that you're bugfree
13:04:25 <mpelley92[m]> <strcat[m] "it's not very realistic to do th"> how is it accomplished? is it like we talked about above, with vendors finding exploits before they're found elsewhere? is that the only way?
13:04:57 <strcat[m]> no
13:04:58 <strcat[m]> look into what GrapheneOS is about
13:05:05 <strcat[m]> the same things apply to firmware
13:05:27 <strcat[m]> but if vulnerabilities are there, they should be found and fixed
13:06:03 <mpelley92[m]> so, best-effort hardening is the first step?
13:06:04 <strcat[m]> be thankful when bugs are in firmware that can be updated rather than hardware requiring discarding the whole device to avoid the issue
13:06:16 <strcat[m]> mpelley92: no
13:06:39 <strcat[m]> the first step is before creating the hardware, firmware or software: having security as part of the process for designing and then implementing it
13:06:54 <strcat[m]> making design decisions prioritizing having a secure architecture
13:07:01 <strcat[m]> using secure tools (which means not using C and C++ at scale)
13:07:06 <mpelley92[m]> but I mean, you're always building on what you've created though?
13:07:25 <strcat[m]> and security should be part of designing and implementing things
13:07:32 <strcat[m]> throughout the process
13:07:38 <strcat[m]> it's not something that can be simply tacked on after the fact
13:07:50 <mpelley92[m]> I gotcha
13:07:55 <strcat[m]> secure architecture and choice of languages and tools
13:08:14 <strcat[m]> and deploying security features to eliminate classes of vulnerabilities
13:08:16 <mpelley92[m]> so, if you're not using C or C++, what are you using?
13:08:22 <strcat[m]> and to harden against exploitation of bugs that do get through
13:08:39 <strcat[m]> mpelley92: depends what kind of code it is
13:09:08 <strcat[m]> for high level code it's a huge productivity boost to be using a more suitable language anyway
13:09:46 <mpelley92[m]> man this is educational
13:09:51 <mpelley92[m]> sincerely
13:10:16 <cyber_john[m]> Hello would grapheneos still be secure on a Google pixel 2xl?
13:10:44 <mpelley92[m]> <cyber_john[m] "Hello would grapheneos still be "> Huge no, it was talked about just recently above ^^^
13:11:17 <cyber_john[m]> I think it’s like 2 month out of date grapheneos ok
13:12:01 <cyber_john[m]> * I think it’s like 2 month out of date grapheneos ok  though I might try other oses then
13:12:12 <mpelley92[m]> I tried asking the same sort of question, but the reasons are very valid as to why it will not be secure in the future
13:12:39 <cyber_john[m]> So should I look into other oses
13:12:52 <mpelley92[m]> If you want to be most secure, upgrade
13:13:09 <jpds> cyber_john[m]: Another device completely given Google have stopped providing updates
13:13:12 <mpelley92[m]> I'm like you, I don't want to move on from my Pixel 2, but we have to :(
13:13:46 <mpelley92[m]> the GrapheneOS team recommended upgrading to the Pixel 4a, or 4a XL for you.
13:13:57 <mpelley92[m]>  * the GrapheneOS team recommended upgrading to the Pixel 4a, or 4 XL for you.
13:14:17 <cyber_john[m]> I’ll try other oses
13:14:34 <mpelley92[m]> LineageOS isn't too bad, but it doesn't come close to GOS.
13:14:56 <mpelley92[m]> If security is your priority, stick with GOS and move to another phone
13:15:24 <mpelley92[m]>  * If security is your priority, stick with GOS and move to another supported phone
13:15:47 <nscnt> cyber_john[m]: Other operating system *won't* make it any more secure
13:15:51 <nscnt> *systems
13:16:08 <strcat[m]> cyber_john: the solution is not another OS
13:16:19 <strcat[m]> cyber_john: we'll be releasing more updates for the Pixel 2 and that is not the issue
13:16:54 <strcat[m]> cyber_john: the Pixel 2 does not have updates available for firmware and device support code anymore
13:17:06 <strcat[m]> cyber_john: no OS you can choose will resolve that
13:17:47 <cyber_john[m]> Yes I know I’ll make it as secure as I can
13:17:56 <strcat[m]> it's an insecure device now so the updates we still plan to release for it are just harm reduction and helping people move on to other devices
13:18:10 <jpds> cyber_john[m]: sigh, you can't, you really can't
13:18:24 <strcat[m]> it's a lower priority than the officially supported devices because it doesn't meet the requirements anymore
13:18:41 <strcat[m]> it probably won't receive many more GrapheneOS updates because it can't accomplish much
13:19:04 <strcat[m]> but we'll do a couple more, probably more spread out than usual, because there's no rush (it's not secure regardless)
13:19:21 <strcat[m]> nothing we can do will make it secure
13:20:00 <nscnt> Nothing any other project can do will make it secure
13:21:22 <mpelley92[m]> on the plus side, you could always turn it into a neat little Wi-Fi playtoy, root and have fun with it.
13:21:40 <mpelley92[m]> that's my plan with my Pixel 2!
13:21:44 <strcat[m]> I regularly try to tell people to avoid buying older generation devices and it would be nice if we got support for newer generation devices faster - requires having more support
13:22:05 <strcat[m]> if you're going to use a device more than 3 years, you need an iPhone
13:22:40 <strcat[m]> future Pixels will be getting 4 years of support soon instead of 3 but iPhones will still be getting substantially longer support
13:22:59 <strcat[m]> maybe it'll get extended from 4 to 5 and then more in the next couple years
13:23:28 <strcat[m]> what we won't do is pretend we can still provide full security updates as many other do
13:23:30 <mpelley92[m]> I would have no problem investing $800 into a device supported for 5 years.
13:23:52 <strcat[m]>  * what we won't do is pretend we can still provide full security updates as many other do when it isn't possible
13:23:59 <strcat[m]>  * what we won't do is pretend we can still provide full security updates as many others do when it isn't possible
13:24:24 <mpelley92[m]> I mean, way more so than buying an iPhone.
13:24:43 <mpelley92[m]> Pretty sure we're all here to avoid that 😅
13:28:06 <cyber_john[m]> Ok I’ll try get a pixel 3a
13:29:43 <rafff[m]> Hi, I am trying to install gos for the first time. When I connect the pixel4a to windows it does recognize it. So I power off the pixel and disconnect the USB. Then I type "fastboot devices" in c:\plaform-tools\ but the pixel does not sow up. Any ideas how to solve this?
13:29:47 <nscnt> cyber_john[m]: This is one of the older devices, too. We recommend against buying older devices
13:30:36 <MysticalOwl> did u enable usb debugging from developer options
13:30:45 <nscnt> rafff[m]: You have disconnected your device and ask why it doesn't show up?
13:30:51 <nscnt> MysticalOwl: Not needed
13:31:05 <rafff[m]> <MysticalOwl "did u enable usb debugging from "> That must be what I skipped
13:31:14 <nscnt> No
13:31:29 <nscnt> USB debugging is not needed
13:31:33 <nscnt> Follow the official guide
13:31:43 <nscnt> https://grapheneos.org/install
13:31:47 <MysticalOwl> also usb preference
13:32:07 <nscnt> No
13:32:09 <MysticalOwl> use usb for file transfer
13:32:14 <nscnt> This is not needed for flashing
13:32:50 <MysticalOwl> right.. nscnt
13:32:51 <nscnt> rafff[m]: Follow https://grapheneos.org/install
13:33:23 <mpelley92[m]> You can put the device into fastboot without the need of USB debugging
13:33:47 <rafff[m]> OK, in this guide there is a curl command for windows, it must be copied and executed in power shell as a whole, right?
13:34:40 <nscnt> rafff[m]: Not sure where you are. Follow it from the top to bottom
13:36:14 <MysticalOwl> how can we use NFC card emulation without rooting
13:36:27 <mpelley92[m]> rafff there's a lot of instructions there, but mainly you need to worry about enabling OEM unlocking and then restarting the phone to the bootloader (volume down while starting it)
13:37:51 <mpelley92[m]> then follow this
13:37:52 <mpelley92[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
13:38:38 <mpelley92[m]> I assume you know the risks, make sure you backup all your data
13:39:39 <goergy[m]> is it possible to have Grapheneos OS on a Pinephone ?
13:39:43 <nscnt> goergy[m]: No
13:40:00 <goergy[m]> why ? it come with no OS
13:40:08 <hello88o[m]> <goergy[m] "is it possible to have Grapheneo"> Only pixels are supported
13:40:15 <strcat[m]> goergy: far from meeting the security and functionality requirements for it
13:40:18 <nscnt> goergy[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
13:40:18 <strcat[m]> hello88o: no, not inherently
13:40:32 <strcat[m]> hello88o: they asked if it was possible not if it was currently supported
13:40:36 <strcat[m]> and no, it's not possible
13:40:47 <strcat[m]> it is possible to support other devices which meet the requirements
13:40:48 <strcat[m]> but not that one
13:40:54 <strcat[m]> best to read the documentation available on the site
13:41:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support and other sections covering the necessary hardware support including https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption and others
13:41:28 <rafff[m]> OEM unlocking is OK. After I download platform-tools (curl command), I try to extract it but it gives error: can't create folder.

13:43:51 <strcat[m]> make sure to do that as it says
13:44:47 <mpelley92[m]> emphasis on using a regular PowerShell terminal, do not run as admin
13:44:55 <voidful[m]> Is windows that troublesome when installing roms? Linux was really straightforward once I had adb going. Thought there were gui tools for windows for this kind of stuff
13:45:07 <strcat[m]> no, it's not troublesome at all
13:45:13 <strcat[m]> in fact it's easiest to follow the instructions on Windows
13:45:24 <nscnt> macOS is easier tbh
13:45:28 <strcat[m]> also the official instructions don't use `adb` for anything only `fastboot`
13:45:30 <nscnt> No driver issues you would run into
13:45:42 <strcat[m]> no driver issues that I've ever seen on Windows though
13:45:54 <strcat[m]> some people seem to have messed up stuff installed
13:45:57 <nscnt> I did. A lot
13:46:04 <voidful[m]> @strcat of fastboot, don't remember exactly, I did it a while ago. Went super smooth though
13:46:28 <strcat[m]> we're working on a WebUSB-based installer to simplify it for people
13:46:41 <strcat[m]> need to find developers to work on it, looking for someone to hire atm
13:46:49 <strcat[m]> still figuring out exactly what has to be done though
13:46:54 <mpelley92[m]> That would actually be sweet
13:47:19 <voidful[m]> <strcat[m] "we're working on a WebUSB-based "> That's awesome. The easier it is, the more people will give it a try.
13:47:24 <mpelley92[m]> I mean, over the years you guys have simplified it pretty well lol
13:48:19 <rafff[m]> OK, I am in a normal power shell and also the pixel is in fastboot. I type fast boot aversion and get the version of fastboot. I type fastboot devices and nothing is shown.
13:49:08 <strcat[m]> rafff: what kind of cable are you using to connect it?
13:49:19 <strcat[m]> look at the info in the prerequisites section on USB issues that people often have
13:49:40 <voidful[m]> <strcat[m] "rafff: what kind of cable are yo"> Oh the cable... Cheap crappy ones will fail... learnt that the hard way -_-
13:51:18 <rafff[m]> <strcat[m] "rafff: what kind of cable are yo"> A typical USB cable that comes with charger phone. It does recognize the pixel when in windows and pixel powered on.
13:51:44 <strcat[m]> rafff: are you using the USB-C cable that came with the phone?
13:52:01 <rafff[m]> <strcat[m] "rafff: are you using the USB-C c"> No
13:52:45 <ayaen_t[m]> if you have a usb c port in the surface pro  please use the cable that came with the phone
13:52:47 <strcat[m]> rafff: use that one
13:53:00 <strcat[m]> most  USB-C cables are not to spec
13:53:39 <rafff[m]> I can't connect it to my surface. It is only usb-c on both ends. I might try another laptop later then. I guess this must be the issue.
13:54:02 <strcat[m]> rafff: the surface pro only has USB-A?
13:54:09 <strcat[m]> try using a different cable if you have one
13:54:24 <rafff[m]> Yes..it is already an old one
13:54:28 <nscnt> 6th generation has only USB-A
13:54:32 <nscnt> 7th should have C
13:55:34 <rafff[m]> Don't worry will try this afternoon in a different laptop. Must find one one. Thx for support. Will report back  later then.

14:11:25 <rdwdfx1[m]> Does/would anyone trust grapheneos with crypto wallets, with wifi and bluetooth turned off ? how would it compare with other hardware wallets, none of the major ones are open source that I know of
14:15:37 <strcat> Trezor is open source (of course, the SoC is not, just like any other ARM device)
14:15:45 <strcat> but doesn't have a secure element
14:17:08 <strcat> rdwdfx1[m]: I would recommend a hardware wallet but it's arguably the next best thing after that (a dedicated device at least)

15:11:14 <User47> Sorry if off topic - what is the preferred messaging app of Graphene users?
15:12:04 <FuchsiaOS_when> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org you can try asking here too
15:12:04 <FuchsiaOS_when> It varies on the purpose
15:14:08 <jandroid[m]> This isn't directly related to GOS, but hope someone can help or point me in the right direction.  Where is eSIM information stored?  In this thread, someone mentioned, he was able to setup eSIM on stock OS and then flash GOS. Why didn't flashing GOS wipe out eSIM? Ref: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159
15:15:38 <FuchsiaOS_when> Beats me, guess it doesn't get wiped on a factory-reset
15:18:46 <lovestory[m]> i had the same issue prior to installing grapheneos
15:19:50 <strcat[m]> jandroid: eSIM is stored on the Snapdragon SPU eSIM
15:20:14 <strcat[m]> factory reset wipes Titan M data and the data partition, not that atm
15:21:20 <jandroid[m]> <strcat[m] "factory reset wipes Titan M data"> thank you!
15:23:39 <bentley> is there a way to view which profiles are logged in, or mass logout of profiles, without either rebooting or manually switching to each profile in turn and hitting "end session"?
15:24:13 <strcat[m]> not really other than a reboot
15:24:14 <strcat[m]> atm
15:24:20 <strcat[m]> although atm only 3 can be active at a time but that will probably be increased
15:24:34 <bentley> i guess rebooting isn't so bad
15:25:04 <strcat[m]> reboot is needed to put the owner profile at rest anyway
15:25:09 <strcat[m]>  * reboot is needed to put the owner profile fully at rest anyway
15:33:15 <lovestory[m]> is there any way to turn off web cache in the browser?
15:40:50 <chris42> Hi there. Are there any information about how the microg setup in grapheneOS will work? Will the complete functionality be available?
15:41:41 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
15:41:55 <somenerd[m]> Compatibility should be similar
15:42:13 <somenerd[m]> and it would be implemented as a regular app without any special permissions
15:44:15 <chris42> yeah, read that.. I am just not sure, if all the functionality will work, like unifiednlp backend, FCM, exposure notification
15:47:06 <somenerd[m]> not too sure about that
15:51:50 <strcat[m]> chris42: supplementary location info won't be done via microG
15:52:07 <strcat[m]> we'll be doing that separately
15:54:16 <chris42> ok, that is good to know. Will you adapt to the unifiednlp modules or do something completely new?
16:00:59 <highz> hey guys nd girls,
16:03:01 <highz> I tried to flash my newly bought and up-to-date pixel 4a with the latest release, but when flashing "flash-all.sh" the 2. last point says: "Setting current slot to 'b'                        FAILED (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')". I tried to get this done with "fastboot set_active aSetting current slot to 'a'
16:03:02 <highz> FAILED (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')
16:03:23 <highz> any ideas? :(
16:08:09 <bentley>  are you using a video or blog or some other tutorial, or the official instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install?
16:17:34 <strcat> highz: it can be fixed but you've gotten it into a messed up state
16:17:55 <strcat> highz: did you perhaps cancel it when it was in the fastbootd mode?
16:20:33 <highz> I followed this 1:1 : https://grapheneos.org/install?
16:21:04 <highz> every think worked like a charm except the 2. last "flash-all.sh"-command
16:21:11 <highz> *everthing
16:24:43 <highz> this is my output after starting the flash script:

16:30:09 <chris42> Try "fastboot snapshot-update cancel"
16:30:13 <chris42> then redo install
16:32:03 <highz> @chris42 seems to work! will report in a few seconds!
16:34:15 <highz> @chris42 it worked! THNAK YOU VERY MUCH! Tried it since 3 hours now.
16:34:21 <highz> Can you explain what went wrong?
16:34:49 <deepwater> Hello, i read that the pixel 4a 5G isn`t supported at the moment. Is there a timeline when/if the 4a 5G is supported? Or should I better buy the 4a (without 5G)
16:36:53 <TAEFED> Hello
16:37:01 <chris42> @highz as far as I know your flashall stopped in the middle, by unplugging, faulty cable, etc. leaving the snapshot in progress
16:37:54 <chris42> then it refuses to reflash...
16:38:23 <TAEFED> im new to all of this, if I install graphene OS on my pixel 4a, how do i know which apps i can then still install? (i.e. Whatsapp, Spotify, Snapchat)
16:40:41 <highz> chris42: Again, thank you! =)
16:40:55 <chris42> @TAEFED there is no list, you will need to test it. Some apps if not finding a google service framework hava a fallback, e.g. Whatsapp. Some just refuse to work
16:41:07 <chris42> @highz np
16:41:20 <strcat> for WhatsApp you just need to enable their own background push option
16:41:27 <strcat> and give it a battery optimization exception
16:41:48 <strcat> it's not very efficient though, Signal's implementation of that is better (still not heavily optimized as it could be)
16:53:18 <nscnt> TAEFED: You can install every app. If an app has a hard depency on Google Play Services, it could crash, though
16:53:49 <nscnt> TAEFED: You can ask at #grapheneos-offtopic if you're concerned. Maybe someone can verify the working of an app
16:56:11 <nscnt> ... the app could crash when *you're trying to use it
16:56:28 <LinusSexTips[m]> <TAEFED "im new to all of this, if I inst"> https://plexus.techlore.tech/
16:58:10 <LinusSexTips[m]> spotify works fine, snapchat will not work without gplay services/microg
17:04:55 <strcat[m]> releases for all devices in the testing channel atm
17:05:08 <strcat[m]> deltas are generated already
17:05:11 <strcat[m]> just needs testing
17:14:08 <ayaen_t[m]> great!
17:25:38 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.01.05.03 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.05.03
17:25:46 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1346508077462380548
17:27:38 <chris42> is that matching january security patch level?
17:28:19 <strcat[m]> it's the first 2 entries in the release notes
17:28:24 <chris42> apparently... wow
17:28:34 <chris42> that is quick
17:29:00 <chris42> google hasn't even updated the build tag website yet ;-)
18:05:21 <strcat[m]> new release is in the Beta channel now
18:05:35 <strcat[m]> please help test it
18:06:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: on it
18:11:39 <ayaen_t[m]> ok
18:13:42 <jftn[m]> Installing the beta to help with the testing!
18:19:36 <signalarch[m]> Anything specific to test?
18:19:55 <jftn[m]> signalarch: Check the releasenotes :)
18:20:52 <tvN> Will grapheneos ever support non-pixel devices?
18:21:33 <signalarch[m]> I looked at them, I'm just asking if there's anything specific to try
18:21:39 <bentley> tvN: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
18:21:50 <cheeriope[m]> `Settings: add setting to toggle between GrapheneOS connectivity check server and the standard Android connectivity check URLs to continue supporting blending in with other Android devices without a VPN`
18:21:50 <cheeriope[m]> nice
18:22:13 <mrxx_0[m]> That black wallpaper
18:23:51 <r0tt0r[m]> just recieved tge update, worked fine so far, gonna test stuff
18:24:13 <r0tt0r[m]> * just recieved the update, worked fine so far, gonna test stuff
18:25:28 <ayaen_t[m]> yeah .smooth as usual.
18:26:03 <ayaen_t[m]> nice touch with blue accent btw
18:26:47 <r0tt0r[m]> hmm calling myself on 4g only gives busy line
18:28:08 <strcat> if someone is interested in getting the couple patches needed to fix the dark theme issues like search in Settings that's welcome
18:28:11 <strcat> I'm not going to do it
18:28:59 <strcat> could also adjust more of the colors, sticking to material palette unlike the stock OS though
18:29:08 <strcat> very low priority for the developers working on other stuff
18:29:15 <strcat> easy thing for someone new to work on
18:30:25 <strcat[m]> going to sleep for now \o
18:30:33 <tvN> bentley seems like only pixel from that
18:30:39 <jftn[m]> Nighty night!
18:30:49 <mrxx_0[m]> See u strcat
18:31:06 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Goodnight strcat !! Thank you for all your hard work. None of what you do goes unappreciated <3
18:31:09 <TAEFED> so I should just install graphene os and find out if every app works or wait?
18:31:40 <ayaen_t[m]> cya strcat
18:33:09 <ayaen_t[m]> TAEFED: you could ask about stuff you expect to work and get answers here though please do it in the offtopic channel
18:33:14 <bentley> tvN: currently only pixels are supported; if other devices now or in the future meet the baseline security requirements they may be supported, provided someone steps up to maintain it
18:43:44 <r0tt0r[m]> thx for all efforts to strcat and team
18:44:05 <r0tt0r[m]> if any help needed for fix calling issue i can reset and retest
19:22:32 <jandroid[m]> <bentley "tvN: currently only pixels are s"> Is Pixel 5/ Pixel 4a 5G on the roadmap?
19:38:49 <cheeriope[m]> jandroid: they both have the same security features (Titan chip) as the currently support devices so I imagine they'll be supported
19:38:52 <cheeriope[m]>  * jandroid: they both have the same security features (Titan chip) as the currently supported devices so I imagine they'll be supported
19:41:06 <ayaen_t[m]> jandroid:  it all comes down to wether someone will show up to support the device
19:42:36 <jandroid[m]> <ayaen_t[m] "jandroid:  it all comes down to "> Ok
19:45:14 <bungeetaco[m]> What needs to be done to support the device?
19:47:15 <bungeetaco[m]> I was thinking of purchasing one since my 3XL's battery is going
19:47:27 <bungeetaco[m]> And I have time
19:47:39 <ayaen_t[m]> bungeetaco: basically build the OS witj the device specific kernel/firmware  iron out the bugs to make it usable and stick around till devive support ends to fix bugs that come along the way and also get all OS updates
19:49:35 <ayaen_t[m]> by updates i mean aosp updates , firmware updates from debice component manufacturers
19:56:04 <bungeetaco[m]> Ok. I know how to use git and have built AOSP from source before using RattlesnakeOS so I get the general idea. You mentioned fixing bugs, what kind of bugs usually come up? Are any other skills required?
19:59:50 <aragorndr[m]> bungeetaco: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os#Device_Maintaining
20:00:42 <bungeetaco[m]> Thanks aragorndr
20:03:24 <Gazar> Hello everyone, I am installing Graphene OS on a pixel 3a from a Manjaro machine (Arch-based). Everything works fine until I run the script "flash-all.sh". Indeed, I get no output and it get stuck (I cannot even interrupt the process and must close the entire terminal).
20:04:14 <Gazar> I cannot report much more because there is no output at all
20:11:42 <chris42_> @Gazar: Have you set ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT to the folder where the images are stored?
20:13:18 <ayaen_t[m]> chris42_: i dont see the need for that
20:13:27 <ayaen_t[m]> he is just onstalling
20:13:49 <Gazar> Yes, indeed I did not, as it is not written in the guide...
20:14:08 <ayaen_t[m]> Gazar: at the riak of repeating i say please folowthe official guide
20:14:12 <chris42_> @ayaen_t: I thought that is a prerequisite for flash-all.sh?
20:14:26 <ayaen_t[m]> lchris42_ no it is not.
20:15:17 <chris42_> ah ok... I got similar "error" as Gazar, when then Strg-C, I get a message wich tells me to set it... but if it is not needed, fine
20:15:27 <ayaen_t[m]> Gazar: please go throughy it from beginning  and tell us what youve done if you get stuck
20:15:57 <ayaen_t[m]> just follow the instructions ,and you'll be fine
20:16:13 <Gazar> Yes, that is what I did, step by step
20:16:47 <ayaen_t[m]> what you dont see nay output on the terminal ?
20:17:02 <ayaen_t[m]> *any
20:17:08 <Gazar> No output, I run the script and I get no output and it get stuck
20:17:39 <Gazar> I also tried the tmp trick as said on the guide but no luck
20:17:50 <Gazar> The phone does not seem to be affected neither
20:18:55 <ayaen_t[m]> no 'waiting for devices' ?in the manjaro terminal ?
20:19:48 <Gazar> Nop, just nothing. I cannot even stop it with control-c
20:20:04 <ayaen_t[m]> where did you get platform tools from ? using pacman?
20:20:11 <Gazar> Yes, pacman
20:21:03 <Andy77> Hi! I am getting this message <Waiting for any device> while trying to unlock the bootloader on Windows 10 via PowerShell
20:21:19 <Andy77> Can someone help me please?!
20:21:46 <Andy77> I have a Pixel 4A btw.
20:21:49 <ayaen_t[m]> Gazar did you install android-udev
20:22:02 <nscnt> Andy77: Be sure that you've installed any optional update on Windows, too
20:22:32 <Gazar> Yes, also android-udev
20:22:39 <nscnt> Andy77: Check whether you have a "View optional updates" in Windows Updates
20:24:03 <ayaen_t[m]> Gazar:  are you using usb c to usb c cable ?
20:24:06 <Andy77> Yes I know see an optional update called "LeMobile...Android Bootloader Interface"
20:24:13 <nscnt> Andy77: Perfect
20:24:14 <Andy77> now*
20:24:15 <ayaen_t[m]> that came withe the device ?
20:24:16 <nscnt> Andy77: Install it
20:24:45 <nscnt> You're kind of proofing a hypothesis of mine
20:24:58 <nscnt> I haven't had time to put time into it myself
20:25:34 <Andy77> D I need to exit Powershell and diconnect my phone, install the update then repeat the whole process from scratch from the official guide ?
20:25:40 <nscnt> Andy77: No
20:25:50 <nscnt> Andy77: Just download and install the update
20:25:59 <nscnt> Andy77: That should fix it if I remember correctly
20:26:05 <Gazar> ayaen_t[m] USB C to USB A as I have no usb C ports. No, With the device I only receive a usb c to usb c
20:26:09 <Andy77> Got it! Thank you :)
20:27:16 <ayaen_t[m]> Gazar: well if youve followed the installation instructions and dont see any output whatsoevwr then i guess the issue maybe with usbc to usb a connetion
20:27:27 <nscnt> Andy77: Want to share what computer/laptop you're on? Maybe I can trace down where this issue is common
20:27:41 <ayaen_t[m]> you found that the cable  works anytime before ?
20:27:53 <ayaen_t[m]> with the device ?
20:28:48 <Andy77> ok, one moment please
20:29:07 <nscnt> Andy77: Did it work so far?
20:30:12 <Gazar> ayaen_t[m] with this cable I could backup the whole phone, so I assumed it worked fine
20:30:32 <Andy77> I was able to unlock the bootloader on my phone but the message "waiting for any device" is still showing up
20:30:51 <nscnt> Andy77: When flashing?
20:31:03 <Gazar> I guess I can try again using Debian buster, as I have that one too
20:31:28 <ayaen_t[m]> Gazar:  sure
20:31:40 <Gazar> Maybe it's Manjaro with its pseudo-arch quirks
20:31:49 <ayaen_t[m]> maybe
20:32:09 <ayaen_t[m]> and also if you can try on another computer
20:32:32 <Andy77> when I ran this cmd: fastboot flashing unlock
20:32:59 <Gazar> Ok, so I will try again and report back whether I succeded or not, thank you for helping!
20:33:03 <nscnt> Andy77: I thought unlocking worked?
20:33:05 <Andy77> < waiting for any device >
20:33:05 <Andy77> OKAY [  0.055s]
20:33:06 <Andy77> Finished. Total time: 319.114s
20:33:17 <Andy77> I think it's okay now, right?
20:33:42 <Andy77> Sorry I am a big noob when it comes to all of this!
20:33:42 <nscnt> Andy77: You need to confirm it on the phone. If you did, it worked
20:34:06 <Andy77> on phone: "Dvice Status: unlocked"
20:34:28 <nscnt> Andy77: Sounds good. Proceed with the installation instruction
20:35:27 <Andy77> Yeah, I already confirmed on my phone. It just took a while to get that "waiting for any device" to disappear and I got a little scared lol
20:36:17 <Andy77> Thanks again :) Do you still need my laptop info?
20:38:15 <nscnt> Andy77: At least the brand would be interesting
20:38:54 <Andy77> HP It's an HP
20:39:30 <Andy77> HP Pavilion
20:40:04 <jftn[m]> There are thousands of HP Pavilions. A submodel really helps :)
20:40:32 <nscnt> Nah, everything's fine
20:40:45 <jftn[m]> Alrighty
20:40:58 <nscnt> I just thought I could trace it down, but doesn't seem like it
20:41:52 <nscnt> The problem is, that _some_ (I don't know what/why) Windows 10 system do not ship the driver needed to communicate with a phone that is in the bootloader interface
20:42:00 <nscnt> Like... Not even an old version
20:42:04 <nscnt> Not installed at all
20:42:24 <nscnt> I think the "update" just gets triggered once a phone in the bootloader interface is connected
20:42:32 <nscnt> And it needs to be installed manually
20:42:51 <ayaen_t[m]> ok im off to go to  sleep
20:43:11 <ayaen_t[m]> nscnt: is it morning in your place?
20:43:17 <jftn[m]> Usually those aspects differ per feature updates. Like: 1903, 2004, 20H2 etc
20:43:26 <nscnt> ayaen_t[m]: nah
20:43:28 <Andy77> Ah okay! Thanks for the detailed info :)
20:43:30 <jftn[m]> Microsoft tends to be a little weird about it
20:43:37 <nscnt> ayaen_t[m]: Time for sleep for me as well, tbh
20:43:48 <jftn[m]> Yeah, me too! Nighty night!
20:43:49 <ayaen_t[m]> oh man!
20:44:18 <ayaen_t[m]> well hes gotta come in the morning
20:44:32 <ayaen_t[m]> hope they find someone
20:59:17 <Andy77> Guys! I can't verify the factory images on PowerShell!
20:59:20 <Andy77> The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version.
20:59:20 <Andy77>     + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
20:59:21 <Andy77>     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidEndOfLine
21:02:35 <Andy77> this is the cmd I used:  signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip.sig && echo verified
21:07:30 <blkqi[m]> Andy77: It is not expected that you use signify on Windows
21:07:36 <blkqi[m]> > You should skip this on macOS and Windows
21:07:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Andy77, you won't be able to use signify on Windows to verify the factory image. Unfortunately, you're going to have to use Auditor to verify post-install.
21:08:23 <Andy77> Ok I'll try to do ir post-install as suggested! Thank you!
21:08:28 <Andy77> it*
21:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> Although you *technically* could download Signify from source and compile it on Windows or prebuilt binaries, the issue is this is largely theatrical because you are no longer chaining trust from your operating system's repositories. So, you'll need to visit https://attestation.app/tutorial and follow the instructions for remote integrity monitoring.
21:08:56 <TheJollyRoger> Of course. Good luck!
21:17:48 <Andy77> I locked the bootloader but I can't start boot GrapheneOS!
21:18:04 <Andy77> Enter reason: no valid slot to boot
21:18:32 <TheJollyRoger> Andy77: what output did you get when you typed `fastboot --version` without the quotes?
21:18:38 <TheJollyRoger> Because I think I know why.
21:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> But I want to test my hypothesis.
21:19:43 <Andy77> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
21:20:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Ok, that caught me off guard, the fastboot version is correct...
21:21:35 <Andy77> Yeah, I made sure it matched the one on the official documentation.
21:22:11 <TheJollyRoger> someone more expert than I is going to need to chime in on this, unfortunately. Not sure why the correct version of fastboot would flash the wrong slot.
21:30:31 <r0tt0r[m]> i think you can make the other slot active via fastboot
21:31:00 <Andy77> I can't even power off the device now!
21:31:19 <r0tt0r[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "i think you can make the other s"> which normally should happen automatically after 3 failed boots
21:31:56 <r0tt0r[m]> <Andy77 "I can't even power off the devic"> hold power button should work
21:35:33 <Andy77> Boot slot is "a" btw
21:36:01 <Andy77> Boot slot: a
21:39:28 <cheeriope[m]> Andy77: sorry you haven't gotten the help you need yet but i'm sure someone will come online and know what the issue is
21:39:30 <Andy77> I retried +10 times with no luck!
21:39:41 <cheeriope[m]> i would advise rebooting and starting from the very beginning
21:39:47 <cheeriope[m]> maybe try a new cable and port
21:40:11 <Andy77> I only have 1 type-C port
21:40:41 <Andy77> Also I only used my phone's cable
21:40:52 <cheeriope[m]> alright forget that then
21:40:59 <cheeriope[m]> just start from the beginning
21:41:30 <Andy77> Okay, I'll do that and see how it goes then, thanks :)
21:41:41 <r0tt0r[m]> did poweroff qoek qhile holding pwr button?
21:41:55 <r0tt0r[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "did poweroff qoek qhile holding "> *work while
21:42:07 <Andy77> Yes I only managed to power it off after disconnecting it from the PC
21:42:37 <Andy77> I'll retry from scratch now!
21:42:52 <r0tt0r[m]> as cheriope say just redo as documentes is good advice
21:43:37 <Andy77> I followed the official guide the first time as well!
21:47:01 <Gazar> Hello there, from Debian I managed to install Graphene OS correctly!
21:47:09 <Gazar> So, maybe it really was Manjaro
21:47:41 <Golli[m]> I was able to install it form Manjaro just fine.
21:48:11 <Gazar> I do have a clue about it tho. Maybe it's the PATH setup, which I did not find in the guide for Arch
21:48:21 <Gazar> Yes? Ah well
21:49:10 <Golli[m]> Did you install the stuff from source? Or did you install it through pacman?
21:52:18 <hasnoname[m]> Was the update pushed already? I don't see on my 4xl
21:52:48 <mrxx_0[m]> hasnoname beta only atm
22:00:18 <Gazar> Golli[m] thru pacman
22:00:39 <Golli[m]> Ah, I installed them through the sources.
22:01:37 <Gazar> Ah, maybe that
22:01:49 <Gazar> Nevermind, next installation maybe :P
22:04:28 <Andy77> Guys! While flashing I got prompted on my phone with he the following:
22:04:35 <Andy77> fastboodtd
22:05:03 <Andy77> Rebbot system now
22:05:18 <Andy77> nvm
22:07:14 <Andy77> Finally it worked
22:07:28 <Andy77> I did something wrong during the installation
22:08:10 <Andy77> I rebooted the bootloader before the end of the flashing process!
22:09:29 <cheeriope[m]> Andy77: you got it all running?
22:09:44 <Andy77> Yes now it worked
22:10:02 <Andy77> during the first try, I rebooted the bootloader before the end of the flashing process!
22:24:58 <r0tt0r[m]> welcome to the wonderfull world of grapheneOS
22:25:48 <Andy77> Thank you ^_^
22:36:21 <duggalsu[m]> Just to confirm, is there any update for the pixel 2 now?
22:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hello duggalsu[m], if you have a Pixel 2, it has reached end of life. The updates you see on GrapheneOS.org are their last. There will be no further updates for it; upstream and Qualcomm have abandoned the Pixel 2.
22:59:14 <TheJollyRoger> The best course of action you can take at this moment is to buy yourself a 4a. You'll probably be quite at home on one of those if you liked the 2.
23:05:41 <TheJollyRoger> The 2 is now abandoned will be insecure. It's now frontdoored for any Android exploits that the November 2020 security patch didn't cover, so hurry.
23:05:50 <TheJollyRoger> *is now abandoned and will be insecure.
23:07:16 <ddddxd[m]> duggalsu: calyx may be an okay option for the pixel 2 but idk really
23:07:33 <ddddxd[m]> get a 4a
23:09:15 <FuchsiaOS_when> <ddddxd[m] "duggalsu: calyx may be an okay o"> No OS can fix an EoL support on firmware vulnerabilities once found
23:09:55 <ddddxd[m]> mmhmm get da 4a then duggalsu
23:10:23 <FuchsiaOS_when> <ddddxd[m] "duggalsu: calyx may be an okay o"> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210105#c6412408
23:10:28 <FuchsiaOS_when> Relevant thread earlier
23:10:50 <TheJollyRoger> FuchsiaOS_when: yeah, once Qualcomm abandons the SoC, they've essentially forced our hand :(
23:11:06 <FuchsiaOS_when> Yeah...
