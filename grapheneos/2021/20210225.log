00:21:18 <nullnode[m]> In Osmand it gives me this message but tts engine is selected and enabled.
00:21:19 <nullnode[m]> thought I did
00:21:20 <nullnode[m]> but will try again
00:21:20 <nullnode[m]> AutoRevokePermissions: Error carrier privileged status for com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android: -2
00:21:20 <nullnode[m]> I do see the above
00:21:20 <nullnode[m]> just uninstalled, rebooting, installing, and testing
00:21:21 <nullnode[m]> just RHVoice first, no maps app
00:21:21 <strcat[m]> nullnode: uninstall the tts engine(s)
00:21:22 <strcat[m]> nullnode: install rhvoice, install english thing in it, make sure it works, enable it in settings
00:21:22 <strcat[m]> make sure it works in settings
00:21:22 <strcat[m]> don't involve osmand until you have a tts enabled and working
00:21:22 <strcat[m]> no point of complicating it by involving osmand before that
00:21:23 <strcat[m]> nullnode: in Settings, you should be able to use the TTS engine
00:21:23 <strcat[m]> it has a way to run a test
00:21:25 <strcat[m]> if you can't do that, it's not set up
00:21:25 <strcat[m]> rhvoice may be buggy, you may have to set it up a certain way
00:21:25 <strcat[m]> to make it work
00:21:25 <strcat[m]> install english before you enable it
00:21:26 <strcat[m]> test it in the rhvoice app
00:21:27 <strcat[m]> then enable it
00:21:29 <strcat[m]> then test it in Settings
00:23:55 <nullnode[m]> Ah, so it won't work if you select "System Default" in the Text-to-speech output settings menu
00:23:56 <nullnode[m]> if you are specific it works for me
00:24:06 <nullnode[m]> fuckin Canada eh
00:24:16 <nullnode[m]> my "English (UNITED STATES)" to work
00:24:43 <nullnode[m]> tedlancer: hey bud, can you verify you have selected a specific language in the settings?
00:25:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> we are pushing a new release to the beta channel. this is a very important release. we'd like if people tested usb and bluetooth audio on the beta. on the pixel 3, 3 xl, 3a, 3a xl please also test the camera and report back even the smallest of breakages asap
00:25:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> it is much more preferable if you could test it before we pushed to beta
00:25:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> please reach out to me or strcat if you can do that
00:26:36 <nullnode[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "it is much more preferable if yo"> Sliding into DM's
00:26:44 <rny> maybe we should have alpha preview channel
00:26:45 <rny> hehe
00:27:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: we do but atm it's only for pixel 4 and newer
00:28:09 <rny> no, i mean for update pushes
00:28:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> we are accepting pixel 3 users as of today
00:28:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny we do
00:28:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> just that pixel 3 did not need anything tested before today
00:29:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> and it didn't have any volunteers helping either
00:29:16 <rny> how do you get volunteers if information isnt being published
00:29:20 <rny> O_O
00:29:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: just stop pls
00:29:41 <castor_tox> hi!
00:29:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> hi castor
00:30:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> good day to you, need help with anything?
00:30:15 <castor_tox> yeah, actually
00:30:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> ask
00:30:36 <rny> ???
00:30:54 <castor_tox> basically i have a pixel 5a 5g that i'm trying to install graphene on, and i checked the cable and everything was connected. however, i get this error:
00:30:55 <castor_tox> fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable
00:31:02 <castor_tox> whenever i try to flash it
00:31:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> okay
00:31:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> have you verified the download?
00:31:21 <castor_tox> the bootloader is unlocked, and i've verified the download
00:31:22 <castor_tox> yes
00:31:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> okay what does your phone say rn?
00:31:43 <castor_tox> additionally, i reflashed android on it right after using the same manual installation process and it worked
00:31:50 <castor_tox> it's just stuck in the bootloader right noww
00:31:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> did it boot into fastbootd?\
00:31:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> \
00:31:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> \
00:31:56 <castor_tox> yes it did
00:32:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> castor_tox: ok i see
00:32:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> so you now have a recovery menu?
00:32:31 <castor_tox> yes, i can get into the recovery menu
00:32:43 <rny> not helpful at all when everything is done behind cloak and daggers, half the time people that want to help cant even keep up with what's going on because its impossible to know what's going on at all
00:32:53 <rny> anupritaisno1[m]: ^
00:33:04 <rny> specifically with the way you opeate
00:33:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> okay so this is basically because something is wrong with the usb driver on your computer
00:33:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> or the port
00:33:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> not much can be done about it so pm me and we'll use another way to get it installed
00:34:02 <castor_tox> alright cool
00:34:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: as a developer my recommendation is to always use the official guide. it works and exists for a reason
00:34:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> but if users have a problem we can give them other options in private
00:34:46 <castor_tox> w8 let me make a freenode account real quick
00:34:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> i don't want others to suggest this stuff
00:35:19 <warmjuice[m]> Bridge broke again
00:35:26 <warmjuice[m]> sad
00:37:26 <castor_tox> ok so basically i'm on webchat rn but i'll come back to this channel via my irc client
00:37:27 <warmjuice[m]> Guess it‚Äôs back
00:41:04 <castor_tox> ok well i think i've been ip banned from freenode cause i can't connect via hexchat
00:42:59 <castor_tox> anupritaisno1[m]: you there?
00:43:18 <rny> castor_tox: arent you connected via freenode now?
00:43:37 <castor_tox> yeah i am but i was going to use a client instead of webchat
00:44:04 <rny> pm me the hostmask
00:44:18 <castor_tox> probably they thought i was a bot but in order to get on webchat you have to complete a captcha
00:44:33 <castor_tox> no idea what that means lol
00:46:05 <castor_tox> What's a hostmask? am i dumb?
00:46:23 <rny> whats the username that got banned
00:46:31 <castor_tox> this one
00:46:51 <castor_tox> at least with this one i can only use webchat
00:46:53 <rny> i dont see it on the banlist.
00:47:10 <castor_tox> welp, why can't i connect then, i'm using the correct port
00:47:30 <rny> ask for help in #freenode
00:47:35 <castor_tox> k wait
00:48:45 <castor_tox> ok i'm in a client now
00:51:42 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> xies?
00:52:29 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> Greetings. I would like to know if I can use GrapheneOS as a replacement for cryptocurrency hardware wallets...
00:52:40 <castor_tox> ok so basically i got an account
00:53:02 <rny> WhyDoYouBlockPro: #grapheneos-offtopic
00:53:15 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> OK
00:57:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> WhyDoYouBlockPro: no, grapheneos is not a replacement for wallets
00:57:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> please use an actual wallet example a trezor model t to store your coins
00:57:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> even if grapheneos is secure the weakest link is your wallet app not implementing security correctly
00:58:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> castor_tox: pm me then
00:59:28 <castor_tox> <anupritaisno1[m]>: first i'll try using the webinstaller
01:00:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> ok
01:03:47 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> anupritaisno1 Makes sense. I was going to use Monerujo (XMR).
01:04:00 <sjbady73[m]> anupritaisno1: what wallet is recommended to use with trezor?
01:04:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> sjbady73: trezor is the wallet
01:04:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> you set up a trezor then use any frontend you want for it
01:04:54 <rny> please, #grapheneos-offtopic
01:05:12 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> Already ended the offtopic conversation.
01:05:22 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> Thanks.
01:05:41 <rny> cryptocurrencies is offtopic in #grapheneos.
01:05:52 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> I wonder if device compatibility is on-topic in #grapheneos?
01:06:33 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> I want to know how much longer will Pixel 2 receive updates. Pixel 2 in the website says "(Obsolete)", but it has the most recent OS version.
01:06:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> WhyDoYouBlockPro: pixel 2 is eol
01:07:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> our current recommendation is a pixel 5
01:07:46 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> Because of the very little money I can get right now (like 200 USD by selling a Nintendo), I was going to get a Pixel by degoogling it with GrapheneOS (LineageOS is not a complete degoogle).
01:08:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "our current recommendation is a "> Does the Pixel 5/4a 5G make any interesting hardware security/privacy improvements over the Pixel 4/4a?
01:08:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> hypokeimenonüñ§‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: yes

01:09:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> slab canaries work
01:10:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> thanks anu
01:10:58 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> When I entered here I had to disable my VPN. My name is basically the question "Why do you block proxies?".
01:11:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> WhyDoYouBlockPro: we don't
01:11:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> might just be freenode acting up
01:12:13 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> That was just what I was about to type. Sorry...
01:12:14 <WhyDoYouBlockPro> And thanks.
01:12:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> you can use tor to sign up to a matrix instance inside whonix
01:12:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> or something
01:12:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> and join here
01:27:18 <castor_tox> so

01:27:55 <hasnoname[m]> Hi, pixel 4xl. Kodi loads to blank  screen. Always has been
01:28:03 <hasnoname[m]> <hasnoname[m] "Hi, pixel 4xl. Kodi loads to bla">  Sorry, offtopic group.
01:28:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> hasnoname: set screen brightness to 0
01:29:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> force stop kodi and launch it now
01:29:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> it'll open
01:29:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> we are working on a fix
01:29:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> it's an upstream issue
01:30:07 <hasnoname[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "hasnoname: set screen brightness"> Wtf. Thanks
01:30:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> it's broken on stock too
01:30:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> not really our problem but the fix is easy
01:32:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> basically kodi breaks when screen refresh rate is 90hz
01:33:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> by setting brightness to 0 we force the refresh rate to be 60
01:33:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> and then it works
01:33:22 <anupritaisno1[m]>  * by setting brightness to 0 we force the refresh rate to be 60hz
01:34:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> this is because pixels control refresh rate based on screen brightness
01:51:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> btw new beta is out
01:51:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> as said earlier
01:51:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> please test usb audio on all devices
01:51:28 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, updating it and testing audio on 4XL. I will post an issue on Github.
01:51:35 <TheJollyRoger> *sorry, on 4 non-XL
01:51:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> additionally on pixel 3, 3xl, 3a, 3a xl you need to test camera
01:52:29 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I no longer have a 3, anyone else here does?
02:16:06 <franken-sword-us> Hi y'all, can you tell me if the webusb insaller ought to work with Brave browser?  anyone try it.  It is essentially chrome with all the Google phone-home heart ripped out
02:20:56 <xx> franken-sword-us: tried it on brave no luck. works on stock chromium.
02:21:14 <xx> That's just my experience, I don't know about the others.
02:21:33 <franken-sword-us> what os?  i was going to try stock ubuntu
02:21:46 * brenneke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UbQJmpIYLCestZuydOCxAWIu/message.txt >
02:21:52 <xx> Linux
02:22:04 <xx> Pop OS to be specific
02:22:34 <franken-sword-us> i'm guessin' the stock chome is necessary for some google shenanigans which are less than desirable.  wondered where we can cut that cord.
02:23:51 <xx> I'm doing browser isolation, I user chromium, brave and Tor Browser. Each one for a different task. never logged in any of them except youtube on the stock chromium.
02:24:22 <xx> Anyway I think that's off topic.
02:26:05 <brenneke[m]> Vid too big.
02:27:06 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: I have a 3, not seeing an update on my device yet
02:27:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hey skwisgaar[m], I didn't get the update either, you may have to download the update offline and sideload it via ADB. You won't need to unlock nor will you lose data by doing this.
02:27:56 <TheJollyRoger> I can walk you through it if you want, the hardest part is doing that annoying combo key to get into the recovery menu.
02:28:58 <skwisgaar[m]> Never done it before, is it not going to go out OTA?
02:29:10 <skwisgaar[m]> Don‚Äôt mind using adb if necessary
02:29:27 <TheJollyRoger> It should be going out via OTA, I just don't know why the update client didn't see it after a few taps and a couple minutes.
02:30:39 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: Brave also does weird things with advertising and monetization, and it also lags behind Chromium severely in terms of updates from upstream. We don't recommend it.
02:32:03 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: Chromium from upstream isn't really "googled" in the first place. Most Linux distributions as a result have no problems including it in their operating system repositories.
02:36:00 <franken-sword-us> TheJollyRoger: chromium as a product is google-ified in my limited experience.  Worked on bringing it into an Android infotainment system a few moons ago.  I have not messed with the source in several years but at the time, it was still heavily tied to GOOG -- even just the raw Chromium itself
02:36:19 * brenneke[m] uploaded a video: gos-keyboard.mp4 (28087KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/WICGpYeuWRUQKewogbaeSHSF/gos-keyboard.mp4 >
02:41:01 <redbeard72> Hello. I just booted up a new, unlocked pixel 4a. I'm attempting OEM unlocking using the graphene install instructions. I've connected to wifi, and have the playstore running. I got to settings -> system -> but can't find the "developer options" from there. I even search for developer options in the search function and get no results.
02:41:02 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: well, we still don't support Brave. You'll need to use Chromium or Edge for the webinstall or use the CLI method.
02:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: go to Settings -> System -> About phone, and tap on "Build Number" ten times quickly with your finger.
02:41:42 <TheJollyRoger> It should report "You are now a developer."
02:41:56 <redbeard72> ok will do
02:43:35 <redbeard72> success
02:44:54 <franken-sword-us> TheJollyRoger: üëçÔ∏è
02:45:23 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: As long as you don't try to deviate from the official installation instructions on the CLI method, such as following a video guide, you should go fine.
02:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: however, IF you follow a third-party video guide, you may end up with a $700 paperweight.
02:46:22 <franken-sword-us> TheJollyRoger: thx, may try the CLI method.  got the pixel 4a hw the other day but waiting or an oppo to try to set it up
02:47:01 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: Great!

12:33:26 <damienrg[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: in https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/pull/72 you said that you had not the time to review the it. What can we do to help you?
12:37:09 <strcat> my main suggestion would be that these communities need to self-moderate better and stop using so much developer time
12:37:12 <strcat> there's an easy way to help
12:37:58 <strcat> and avoid pinging me about stuff in PM or in the channel unless there's a good reason
12:40:01 <damienrg[m]> OK.
12:40:22 <strcat> read before asking questions, search for answers first, avoid filing issues without checking for existing ones first, avoid contacting specific devs about generic things, etc.
12:40:45 <strcat> not talking about you specifically btw at all
12:41:00 <strcat> the community overall could have much more respect for other people's time, particular developer time
12:42:00 <strcat> people specifically sending me emails asking questions which could be answered by others (or by reading the docs), etc.
12:42:29 <hysaag77[m]> Just an opinion: The official website should have more/better documentation on more things so people would not have to ask for help
12:44:10 <damienrg[m]> <hysaag77[m] "Just an opinion: The official we"> You can open a PR at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org.
12:45:17 <hysaag77[m]> Right
12:48:52 <nscnt[m]> Documentation on what?
12:49:26 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah , wonder the same
12:49:36 <hysaag77[m]> Like most commonly asked questions or like how to install fdroid on secondary profile etc
12:50:05 <take_a_deep_brea> well that is fdroid's problem lol
12:50:25 <take_a_deep_brea> and anyway that has been answered multiple times
12:50:43 <hysaag77[m]> Right sorry for saying anything. Will go kill myself
12:50:54 <take_a_deep_brea> great
12:52:05 <take_a_deep_brea> i thought adding "lol" at the end  does make me sound light hearted ?
12:53:32 <nscnt[m]> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
12:54:37 <take_a_deep_brea> exactly
12:55:08 <take_a_deep_brea> and it is a non trivial matter to properly explain
12:56:16 <take_a_deep_brea> its not even that , they just have to tweak their website
12:58:58 <damienrg[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "and anyway that has been answere"> You are right and at the same time I had to go here to find the answer.
13:00:02 <take_a_deep_brea> i guess i could have linked them the logbot
13:00:14 <take_a_deep_brea> but they've got to show some initiative
13:00:25 <take_a_deep_brea> or atleast wait
13:01:38 <take_a_deep_brea> or ask more nicely . i dont assume that people should give me their time . atleast, i hope i am not doing that .
13:03:44 <take_a_deep_brea> and if they foiund me  unpleasent , i am not the only person here lol , could've ignored me and waited for someone else
13:03:53 <take_a_deep_brea>  * and if they found me  unpleasent , i am not the only person here lol , could've ignored me and waited for someone else
13:04:39 <nscnt[m]> I'm not sure why we are being criticized for someone else's problem? What do you expect from GrapheneOS again?
13:09:47 <damienrg[m]> <strcat[m] "damienrg: please file a bug with"> OK.
13:11:36 <take_a_deep_brea> well , we'll really appreciate that damienrg .
13:11:45 <take_a_deep_brea>  * well , we really appreciate that damienrg .
13:18:08 <psychologicaldam> hysaag77: lol people don't even read the existing docs, how would more docs help? the solution is that people  read the docs and search elsewhere before asking the devs
13:18:43 <take_a_deep_brea> psychologicaldam:  intriguing nick : )
13:20:27 <psychologicaldam> except when it comes to installation, just follow the official guide, do not search elsewhere ;)
13:21:57 <mynacol[m]> <strcat "has *anyone* reported that probl"> Just did (wanted to do it anyways)
13:24:37 <miketanner[m]> Share them and all downvote them
13:27:22 <take_a_deep_brea> imo that will count as a coordinated attack, not the best approach. as it is some motivated individuals have accused parts of this community earlier on twitter .
13:27:35 <take_a_deep_brea> and btw not blaming/accusing you of any bad ideas miketanner
13:28:16 <miketanner[m]> No worries. Just something I've done for years in other tech groups to stop bad info
13:29:09 <take_a_deep_brea> aaahh. good that it worked out for you ! and its my opinion ,not the brightest guy in here .
13:30:15 <miketanner[m]> We also always comment - "this is bad info" type stuff. It's important to counter bad info to keep the project integrity intact.
13:36:44 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> guys,i need help. i flashed graphene on my new pixel 5, but it still boots into fastboot mode and says : enter reason: no valid slot to boot. did i do sth wrong?
13:37:17 <mynacol[m]> jdiidiebhdukdkks: Sounds like the install failed half-way
13:37:30 <mynacol[m]> That's no problem
13:37:59 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> i already tried 2 times and still got the same result
13:38:12 <mynacol[m]> First things first: Did you try the web installer? https://grapheneos.org/install/web
13:38:22 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> no, the CLI installer
13:39:48 <StVM[m]> Try web installer. It is easier and safer.
13:39:58 <take_a_deep_brea> true
13:40:01 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> alright, thanks
13:40:23 <take_a_deep_brea> jdiidiebhdukdkks:  you can still ask help here if you have issues with web installer
13:40:55 <takama02[m]> Hi, may I please have a question on user profiles. On my pixel 3a i can't install fdroid neither on guest nor new one. Wanted separate them for proprietary crap.
13:41:03 <dazinism> damienrg: I started up the community wiki as a place for people to get info/document stuff thats beyond the scope of the main site.
13:41:12 <rickza[m]> hi there all, any solutions as to using a car with mirrorlink/android auto with grapheneos ? or would using a different device be best ? Thanks
13:41:50 <mynacol[m]> <takama02[m] "Hi, may I please have a question"> Please download the latest APK from here: https://f-droid.org/de/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
13:42:29 <take_a_deep_brea> takama02:  strongly suggest using foxy droid client as it targets a higher API and also has better UI and does not have this issue ofcourse : https://f-droid.org/en/packages/nya.kitsunyan.foxydroid/
13:43:00 <take_a_deep_brea> but then if you dont want to , then yeah , go with what mynacol  said
13:43:13 <takama02[m]> Yeah but can it be installed on a dedicated new user profile? If I don't have any app client yet
13:43:23 <takama02[m]> From apk or so
13:43:44 <mynacol[m]> <takama02[m] "From apk or so "> Yes, you download an APK from the link
13:44:12 <damienrg[m]> <takama02[m] "Yeah but can it be installed on "> You have to trust vanadium as source to install APK.
13:44:40 <takama02[m]> I did but it says app not installed after an attempt
13:45:05 <takama02[m]> Which looked promising. Will try from this link thank you. Brb
13:45:24 <dazinism> damienrg the wiki is at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home
13:45:33 <damienrg[m]> <takama02[m] "I did but it says app not instal"> Use https://f-droid.org/repo/org.fdroid.fdroid_1011050.apk and try again.
13:46:25 <dazinism> Theres a 'sister' wiki thats got a load of other generic AOSP/Android info
13:46:37 <take_a_deep_brea> dazinism:  my bad , completely forgot about this excellent source . thanks for reminding !
13:47:10 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
13:47:38 <mynacol[m]> <rickza[m] "hi there all, any solutions as t"> No idea. Maybe someone else will answer later on.
13:48:10 <tedlancer[m]> nullnode strcat this is what's happening - it doesn't allow any languages to set in TTS
13:48:42 * tedlancer[m] uploaded a video: signal-2021-02-25-054756.mp4 (3619KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gZfPPFvnwWgUeVKkmokWxgQs/signal-2021-02-25-054756.mp4 >

13:50:13 <dazinism> Can see there the tests are greyed for me, but it does work in apps...
13:50:25 <damienrg[m]> <dazinism "damienrg the wiki is at https://"> I had found this wiki when I searched information about GOS. I did not read a lot because GOS only recommends grapheneos.org.
13:51:13 <dazinism> Yeah... some people really struggle with it
13:51:42 <waterisblue7[m]> <dazinism "Screenshot_20210225-134851.png"> did u see my video? i was doing it but it wont set the languages
13:51:54 <dazinism> Randomly on some installs that page i just posted in settings doesnt show
13:52:23 <dazinism> Just doesnt open if you got RHVoice installed
13:52:33 <dazinism> Not just on Graphene either
13:52:57 <dazinism> You just get a black screen.
13:53:16 <dazinism> Reinstalling RHVoice can fix it
13:55:29 <dazinism> @strcat:matrix.org: think that was the way I set it up. But the test buttons in the AOSP TTS page have always been grey for me
13:55:31 <dazinism> But it works in OSMand and an eBook reader
13:56:53 <dazinism> Yeah thatd be really good to do.
13:57:33 <dazinism> Not heard of an open TTS other than RHVoice thats under active development
13:58:11 <tedlancer[m]> So I uninstalled rhvoice, rebooted, installed again n still same prob
13:58:11 <tedlancer[m]> Can't select anything other than system language
13:58:26 <tedlancer[m]> So u think it might b an app issue?
13:58:54 <mynacol[m]> tedlancer: Yes, its an app issue. Please contact them for support
13:58:58 <dazinism> Yeah, its buggy
13:59:24 <dazinism> Would be great if it could be fixed up
13:59:24 <tedlancer[m]> <strcat "tedlancer: need to do it the way"> Isn't that what I just did?
14:00:14 <tedlancer[m]> <strcat "you didn't give details on what "> So I uninstalled rhvoice, rebooted, installed again n still same prob
14:00:20 <dazinism> Gonna try again, see if I can get rid of grey buttons...
14:00:57 <dazinism> tedlancer: guess its doing stuff in the right order, downloading the language in RHVoice etc.
14:04:02 <mynacol[m]> Move it to #grapheneos-offtopic, please
14:04:16 <tedlancer[m]> I'm not clear on what ur instructions r
14:04:16 <tedlancer[m]> Can u please state them?
14:04:30 <tedlancer[m]> I thought I did as u suggested
14:04:59 <mynacol[m]> tedlancer: Please move to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
14:05:14 <tedlancer[m]> Ok
14:09:48 <dazinism> Ah the reason the testing was greyed out was because I had system default selected rather than en_US
14:11:06 <dazinism> Think thats just for the test there though? Theres also more settings if you press the cog to the right of 'preferred engine'
14:20:30 <dazinism> Yeah, as I speak proper English en_US isnt my default üòÉ
14:21:36 <dazinism> I try to resist
14:23:37 <dazinism> lol bridging
14:23:44 <strcat> dazinism: since it's not having strcat[m] join irc anymore
14:23:52 <strcat> it looks like you're talking to yourself here
14:24:02 <strcat> don't know how to fix it
14:24:03 <dazinism> I often do
14:24:08 <strcat> I tried !nick, !storepass, etc.
14:25:16 <strcat> please come back strcat[m]
14:25:18 * strcat sighs at matrix
14:26:20 <dazinism> I was gonna say can't you leave the room and rejoin. But that probably isn't a great idea....
14:26:47 <strcat> I'd lose admin
14:26:51 <strcat> matrix admins had to give me that
14:26:53 <dazinism> ..unless you grant someone else admin before you do
14:27:06 <dazinism> Could create a second account
14:27:39 <dazinism> Think all admins are equal so you can do it also now?
14:32:13 <dazinism> Had to login again?
14:32:14 <somenerd[m]> > matrix is so _great_
14:32:14 <somenerd[m]> amazing
14:32:14 <somenerd[m]> what is happening lol
14:32:42 <somenerd[m]> 20 GB??????????
14:32:43 <dazinism> 20GB of memory is good going
14:32:57 <somenerd[m]> how does that happen though?
14:34:15 <dazinism> That works then
14:35:29 <dazinism> Ah, you kept admin
14:35:29 <somenerd[m]> how so?
14:35:34 <somenerd[m]> oh
14:35:46 <somenerd[m]> wow it is very buggy lol
14:36:19 <somenerd[m]> is that the reason?
14:36:21 <somenerd[m]> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
14:37:01 <somenerd[m]> > and got kicked
14:37:01 <somenerd[m]> bridges are like that for some reason
14:37:12 <somenerd[m]> if a person is banned or kicked
14:37:34 <somenerd[m]> they'll be very buggy, even when the person is reinvited
14:37:41 <somenerd[m]> > is there no way to make it refresh?
14:37:41 <somenerd[m]> I don
14:37:48 <somenerd[m]>  * > is there no way to make it refresh?
14:37:48 <somenerd[m]> I don't remember how
14:37:57 <somenerd[m]> it was fixed iirc
14:38:00 <somenerd[m]> but I don
14:38:08 <somenerd[m]>  * but I don't remember exactly how
14:38:51 <somenerd[m]> think that it has to be fixed on the IRC side
14:38:58 <strcat> how?
14:39:02 <strcat> it's not joining irc at all
14:39:10 <strcat> I mean that I think freenode force kicked it / renamed it
14:39:15 <strcat> and it won't retry
14:39:22 <johnathandoen[m]> Q: is it possible to choose a pc instead of a usb flash drive as a backup location?
14:39:26 <somenerd[m]> yeah something along those lines
14:39:30 <strcat> johnathandoen[m]: no
14:39:33 <dazinism> Guess ask in #irc:matrix.org
14:40:00 <dazinism> Freenode admins also lurk there and have been helpful
14:40:07 <dazinism> In the past
14:40:34 <somenerd[m]> it's not connecting to any bridges...
14:40:39 <somenerd[m]> wow
14:40:39 <johnathandoen[m]> strcat: alrigth thx
14:40:40 <stencil[m]> V0.24<---alpha software
14:42:58 <dazinism> Will check
14:43:04 <stencil[m]> #matrix-irc
14:43:13 <stencil[m]> Prob
14:43:32 <stencil[m]> Y
14:44:09 <dazinism> Yeah
14:44:11 <stencil[m]> Just checked on matrix topic, sure now
14:45:59 <dazinism> I'll let do it then strcat? I'm not totally following what happened to you and you have powers both sides of the bridge
14:46:24 <strcat> dazinism: so, my strcat[m] user on freenode is gone
14:46:29 <strcat> dazinism: the bridged user it makes for me
14:46:29 <dazinism> Shall I give up admin here?
14:46:31 <strcat> is just gone
14:46:34 <strcat> dazinism: nah
14:46:36 <strcat> dazinism: keep it for now
14:46:39 <strcat> worried bot will kick me
14:47:45 <stencil[m]> If you give up admin it maybe possible nobody can get afmin again(possibly)
14:48:04 <stencil[m]> * If you give up admin it maybe possible nobody can get admin again(possibly)
14:48:36 <somenerd[m]> the bot probs has admin
14:49:42 <somenerd[m]> actually, it does have admin
14:49:46 <dazinism> Can see who has it (including bots) on the room participant list
14:50:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah, I just checked it
14:51:03 <dazinism> Hopefully someone will answer you in the #matrix-irc
14:51:16 <somenerd[m]> > and they'd have to rejoin
14:51:16 <somenerd[m]> yeah it does that
14:51:31 <strcat> yeah so probably won't do that until it works better...
14:51:40 <somenerd[m]> everyone that sees the channel can see a dialog box asking to move to the new channel though
14:51:52 <strcat> then again it kicks everyone after 30 days
14:51:54 <strcat> anyway
14:51:56 <strcat> if they don't talk
14:51:58 <strcat> I hate that
14:52:17 <strcat> that's why the channel is still ~1k
14:52:20 <strcat> instead of 3k+ lol
14:52:42 <strcat> only people who actively talk get to stay thanks to the matrix irc bridge kicking ppl
14:52:59 <somenerd[m]> probably pushed a lot of people to be active though
14:53:15 <somenerd[m]> > only people who actively talk get to stay thanks to the matrix irc bridge kicking ppl
14:53:15 <somenerd[m]> yeah, if a person wants to lurk.... well good luck lol
14:54:21 <somenerd[m]> > it's super annoying
14:54:21 <somenerd[m]> yeah, it is
14:54:29 <somenerd[m]> only active people get to stay
14:54:38 <somenerd[m]> logbot's also there
14:54:41 <somenerd[m]> which is nice
15:01:09 <strcat> dazinism: no response in that bridge room
15:17:13 <dazinism> strcat you got a chat live with @appservice-irc:matrix.org ?
15:19:08 <dazinism> Say report issues on https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc
15:20:04 <dazinism> Guess someone may get back to you in #matrix:irc
15:21:30 <dazinism> I must of got lucky, got an instant response when I was trying to sort an issue (wanted to get freenode user Op)
15:30:43 <zer011[m]> Hello sambody can help me ;)

15:41:47 <carbonatom[m]> <zer011[m] "Hello sambody can help me ;)"> Follow the official web install guide.
15:42:12 <carbonatom[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web

15:45:36 <carbonatom[m]> Thanks, I'll check in there.
16:00:37 <zer011[m]> I have problem
16:01:23 <zer011[m]> I can turn on oem
16:01:25 <zer011[m]> All do new updates
16:27:48 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> my phone has booted into fastbootd grapheneOs fastboot screen and on the PC it says <waiting for any device>. what do i do now?
16:31:50 <TheJollyRoger> jdiidiebhdukdkks: check to ensure the phone's plugged in, that you have the correct driver installed via Windows update, and that your USB cable is the google branded one.
16:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> If you need to use a USB A to C cable, make sure it's fully traced: get an Anker or Aukey one, those tend to work. Most consumer USB cables don't include the wires necessary for fastboot debugging, only the wires needed to transfer files and other "common" uses.
16:34:04 <TheJollyRoger> If all those conditions are met, then chances are your computer motherboard's USB firmware doesn't support the interface needed for fastboot.
16:34:34 <TheJollyRoger> In which case, try switching USB slots, or switching to a different computer.
16:34:49 <TheJollyRoger> (We've had bad luck with people having multiple computers with broken USB, due to sloppy vendors.)
16:39:12 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> alright, thank you
16:46:14 <thetranstocommie> hey so i just got the latest update, and the new settings app looks great!
16:52:07 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
16:56:28 <sonic_the_hedgeh> looking forward to see the colors. is it darker-than-black :)
16:57:39 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
16:58:26 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah thank you for that , i was about to ...
17:00:29 <take_a_deep_brea> true
17:01:46 <thetranstocommie> the only other tiny little request i have as far as theming goes would be dark themes in messaging and phone. both dark themes seem to work flawlessly when turning on "Override force-dark" in the developer options (don't turn this on because it does break plenty of non-stock apps), and it'd make my eyes really grateful when im texting at 1 AM lol
17:02:20 <nscnt[m]> y u sms at 1 am tho
17:02:28 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
17:02:42 <thetranstocommie> <nscnt[m] "y u sms at 1 am tho"> bc i dont sleep lmao
17:02:46 <take_a_deep_brea> use signal <sarcasm>
17:03:14 <take_a_deep_brea> understandable
17:03:46 <thetranstocommie> <strcat "the trans to commie pipeline: : "> i figured it was just kinda a flip of a switch since like i said, it works fine with the developer option. but if its gonna be actual work than yeah don't bother lol
17:05:46 <thetranstocommie> gotcha
17:05:47 <nullnode[m]> I cast a vote for neon pink GSM/IMS comms
17:05:48 <thetranstocommie> honestly? thatd be based
17:05:49 <nullnode[m]> best idea
17:07:32 <thetranstocommie> grapheneos makes me feel not gross touching an android phone and for that i'm insanely grateful
17:11:08 <thetranstocommie> i know the long term goal of the project is to move away from android entirely, but for the time being making android this robust and secure is such an incredible accomplishment
17:47:53 <askerai> Hello
17:48:11 <askerai> Has anyone already tested graphene on Pixel 5?
17:49:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> askerai: yes
17:50:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> It works fine though it's still in early stages
17:58:33 <zvl12[m]> <thetranstocommie "the only other tiny little reque"> interesting that the dark theme indeed makes Signal as well dark
18:18:09 <PNDMT12345[m]> I notice that my battery lasts just half day even when I don't watch video. How to optimize the battery so that I can manage a day without charging??
18:18:11 <PNDMT12345[m]> I use dark theme
18:32:46 <sonic_the_hedgeh> On my pixel 4a, my battery lasts 2 days or longer. Maybe you can try to find out if it is a specific app using all the battery. Should be listed in battery usage in the settings.
18:36:02 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah , left alone my phone can last upto more than 6 days  days . (mind you i said left alone.)
18:36:04 <take_a_deep_brea> and on normal usage 2-3 days
18:36:05 <mr_hebi_san[m]>  My brand new 4a lasts a very long time just idling.  2 or more days.  That's even with some apps running in the background.
18:36:06 <mr_hebi_san[m]> But NewPipe absolutely rips the battery apart and that's even if it's backgrounded
18:36:07 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Does the battery menu tell you what apps are using the most power?
18:47:51 <raavann[m]> mr_hebi_san: yes. check the battery usage option..

18:51:12 <PNDMT12345[m]> <strcat "PNDMT12345: sounds like you're r"> Brand new Pixel 3
18:52:32 <PNDMT12345[m]> <sonic_the_hedgeh "On my pixel 4a, my battery lasts"> Checked there. Nothing unusual
18:54:18 <PNDMT12345[m]> <strcat "PNDMT12345: can't be brand new, "> I meant "new" phone
19:01:51 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Batteries lose their ability to hold a charge over time even if they are not actively being run.  A "new" phone made a year or two ago will have less battery power than if you'd bought it on release day
19:04:46 <demonmachina[m]> In recent history, purchased two Pixel 3s.....one lasted a month before the battery started to expand and it wouldn't hold a charge. The the other lasted a bit longer... but same thing. Shit battery. I know they are user replaceable, but this is the last year for them anyway so what's the point?
19:04:46 <demonmachina[m]> FWIW, one was from Swappa, the other off of CL.
19:05:19 <hitchhooker[m]> pixel 3 battery just terrible
19:07:27 <TheJollyRoger> demonmachina[m]: Very likely you got a refurb from an unscrupulous seller that used a generic or whitelabel battery.
19:07:37 <TheJollyRoger> I purchased my P3 new, and its battery lasted well.
19:11:17 <demonmachina[m]> All facts... wasn't super happy about it... would have liked to have at least made a good year out of it.
19:11:17 <demonmachina[m]> Just picked up the 4a5G New. It's a little bigger than I was hoping for, but should work for some time.
19:30:34 <PNDMT12345[m]> <TheJollyRoger "demonmachina: Very likely you go"> Bought it from Google store. Is it possible to change the battery,?
19:32:39 <SRC> I am running Chromium on Pure OS (Debian Linux). I have my new Pixel connected but the Graphene web installer is not seeing the device, when I click on unlock bootloader the popup keeps saying no compatible devices found?
19:33:33 <nscnt[m]> SRC: Have you set up the udev rules?
19:33:46 <SRC> No how do I do that?
19:33:58 <SRC> My first time trying this
19:34:24 <nscnt[m]> SRC: You probably missed https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-as-non-root
19:35:30 <SRC> I didn't install that because it only references it for Arch Linux
19:35:39 <SRC> I'll install it
19:36:11 <nscnt[m]> > On Debian and Ubuntu, install the android-sdk-platform-tools-common package.
19:37:29 <SRC> I have installed that
19:38:20 <xx> Error: Timeout of 1000 ms exceeded from the web installer
19:38:52 <SRC> Do I need to run any command to configure the platform tools or set up the udev rules?
19:40:26 <nscnt[m]> SRC: Re-plug the device. Is it working?
19:41:16 <SRC> The system sees it but the web installer doesn't
19:41:31 <nscnt[m]> SRC: Have you already booted into the boot loader interface as well?
19:42:06 <TheJollyRoger> SRC unplug it and plug it back in. Switch it into fastboot.
19:42:33 <SRC> Ok
19:44:33 <TheJollyRoger> PNDMT12345[m]: you need special tools to change the battery.
19:44:51 <TheJollyRoger> PNDMT12345[m]: including a special high pressure testing machine and the sealant to do the water resistance.
19:47:52 <askerai> Many thanks!
19:49:21 <SRC> Thanks, the bootloader is now unlocked but when I click to download the factory image it keeps saying error: undefined
19:49:24 <PNDMT12345[m]> <TheJollyRoger "PNDMT12345: including a special "> Sounds not easy. Need to find a guy in a local mall
19:55:30 <TheJollyRoger> PNDMT12345[m]: Yeah, it's not something you can do yourself. Even then, even the authorized service places don't do the resealing properly.
19:57:45 <SRC> The text displays the proper factory image for a split second but then switches to error: undefined in red
19:58:07 <SRC> When trying to download
19:58:20 <TheJollyRoger> SRC turn off incognito mode.
20:01:52 <SRC> I'm not in incognito mode
20:06:52 <SRC> Can I download the image manually and then use the web installer to flash it to the phone?
20:09:14 <ry`an> "special high pressure testing machine and the sealant to do the water resistance."
20:09:20 <ry`an> sounds like something most watch repair places could do
20:09:53 <ry`an> depending on the nature of the sealant, anyway
20:22:45 <jdiidiebhdukdkks> <TheJollyRoger "(We've had bad luck with people "> using a different usb cable solved the problem. thank you
20:29:46 <Rhett> Tried to download the image with the web installer and got Error: The specified endpoint is not part of a claimed and selected alternate interface.
20:42:05 <Rhett> What does this error mean and how do you fix it?
21:03:24 <jj1013> Greetings, is anybody active...?
21:04:08 <jj1013> Does anybody know if the GOS web installer detect if the device is compatible with the ROM, and if it can check sigs?
21:38:25 <jj1013> Does anybody know if the web installer works with ungoogled-chromium?
22:03:04 <rny> jj1013: why dont you try?
22:03:05 <rny> it should work
23:03:09 <matrix_with_tele> Hello guys!
23:03:32 <matrix_with_tele> is it possible that we link Matrix with Telegram?
23:03:33 <matrix_with_tele> Via https://t2bot.io/telegram/ this seems to be easy (the andOTP app does this successfully).
23:04:46 <rny> we're already struggling with moderating matrix from IRC.
23:04:59 <rny> it is likely that linking matrix with telegram will make matters even worse.
23:05:29 <rny> this is something that is in dicussion privately between moderators.
23:05:40 <rny> i.e. thinking/working on it
23:05:52 <rny> matrix_with_tele: ^
23:06:06 <matrix_with_tele> Fair enough. Would be awesome
23:07:58 <matrix_with_tele> For Telegram also an Anti-Spam bot exists: https://github.com/backmeupplz/shieldy
23:22:26 <isou> hey guys can somebody explain me why its write (obselete) for google pixel 2 and google pixel 2 XL,

23:25:01 <isou> thanks for this link:)
23:46:11 <isavotoast[m]> what kind of email clients are you guys using?
23:48:10 <marsgoals[m]> <isavotoast[m] "what kind of email clients are y"> isavotoast: Protonmail or Tutanota for me
23:49:12 <isavotoast[m]> do they support pop3 or imap to pull email from other clients?
23:50:01 <skwisgaar[m]> isavotoast: FairEmail is really great
23:50:15 <marsgoals[m]> I think protonmail does, you may need their paid plan but I'm not sure. I'm not sure about Tutanota ...
23:51:00 <marsgoals[m]> Is FairEmail end-to-end encrypted?
23:51:02 <skwisgaar[m]> Protonmail doesn‚Äôt support imap unless you use protonmail bridge
23:51:50 <isavotoast[m]> I just started working on my pixel5 build, slowly getting situated. I use gmail and protonmail. trying to slowly get off the tit after.. 13 years? of gmail etc
23:51:51 <skwisgaar[m]> FairEmail is just an email client
23:51:52 <skwisgaar[m]> Not an email service
23:51:52 <isavotoast[m]> is your handle a metalocalypse reference?
23:51:55 <critbase[m]1> i use the k-9 mail beta client
23:52:18 <skwisgaar[m]> Yep it is haha
23:52:45 <isavotoast[m]> perfect. nice haha haven't seen that show in years.
23:53:20 <skwisgaar[m]> Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous but pretty great lol
23:53:47 <isavotoast[m]> fairmail and k-9 seem to be pretty popular
23:54:08 <isavotoast[m]> the music is unironically good. wish I caught them on tour
23:55:53 <skwisgaar[m]> Now that would have been awesome, wish I did too
23:56:21 <skwisgaar[m]> I would use fairemail personally, it gets updated often and has a ton of features
23:56:26 <Carptarts> Hi, I'm trying the CLI install on Manjaro; to a Pixel 2 XL
23:56:35 <skwisgaar[m]> But havent tried k9 before
23:56:37 <Carptarts> I keep getting told bsdtar isn't present
23:57:42 <marsgoals[m]> Anyone with a deep knowledge of setting up profiles? I'm a bit confused on the specific reasons for this and best use cases
23:58:03 <Carptarts> Can anyone point me in the right direction?
