00:00:15 <TheJollyRoger> There was an update just now.
00:00:58 <TheJollyRoger> iceman4455: in order to be affected by this trojan, you would need to go find the apk, install it on your GrapheneOS phone yourself, then grant it all of the permissions to record audio and access call logs.
00:01:20 <TheJollyRoger> TLDR: GrapheneOS not affected.
00:01:57 <iceman4455> So its grapheme hardening that's stops this essentialy. Thanks for the help
00:02:12 <iceman4455> *graphene
00:02:42 <TheJollyRoger> This malware relies on tricking the user into making a bad decision.
00:03:02 <TheJollyRoger> A series of bad decisions, actually.
00:03:17 <iceman4455> OK thanks
00:05:30 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, apps on GrapheneOS are *always* sandboxed, even more so than the regular operating system. They can only have access to data you give them.
00:06:10 <TheJollyRoger> This is why app-accessible root will never be supported on *any* build of GrapheneOS.
00:06:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you root, this is how stuff like this happens.
00:06:28 <m2tu[m]> for this rason i did an option to shutdown sdcard emulator so nothign can be downlaoded from browsers
00:07:01 <akc3n[m]> <iceman4455 "So its grapheme hardening that's"> Here is a partial list of GOS features that go above and beyond of what AOSP provides:
00:08:08 <TheJollyRoger> iceman4455: on GrapheneOS, updates are signed and verified end-to-end and checked against your Android Verified Boot keys. Even if an adversary was to compromise the update server, or get a counterfeit TLS certificate, if they attempted to alter just one bit of the update package, your phone would reject the update.
00:08:22 <TheJollyRoger> So you're safe.
00:08:36 <iceman4455> Awesome

01:41:50 <d42> fortunately i can, but it is still quite a bummer
01:42:33 <dragonfly826[m]> Hi there I'm back and because I'll be recovering my devices permissions, I decided to try just enabling absolutely all system permissions. I'm afraid to report that I still get the same issue on video calling through browsers, where I recive no video or audio from the other person :(
01:43:33 <dragonfly826[m]> Anyone have any ideas? I've changed browsers and really scavenged through the web with regard to this issue
01:43:40 <dragonfly826[m]> But nothing I'm afraid
01:44:07 <dragonfly826[m]> Any help would be massively apreciated.
01:45:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hi dragonfly826[m], the last thing I can think of would be to back up all your stuff off the phone, and then factory reset.
01:46:17 <TheJollyRoger> If the nuclear option doesn't fix it, then I'm out of ideas.
01:46:39 <dragonfly826[m]> Aw darn are you sure? I really didn't want to nuke my phone :(
01:46:59 <FieryBinary> Just to add, the other person's video/audio isn't related to your own sensors.
01:47:07 <TheJollyRoger> Someone else here may have some ideas.
01:47:32 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know what other changes he's made to his phone, or what options he may have set or toyed around with, that's the thing.
01:47:37 <FieryBinary> dragonfly826[m] Unfortunately you probably have to do what TheJollyRoger mentioned.
01:48:40 <FieryBinary> Your video/audio issues may be due to browser settings though.
01:49:03 <dragonfly826[m]> What settings could affect it?
01:49:13 <dragonfly826[m]> I've looked through every button I think
01:49:17 <FieryBinary> Huh
01:49:24 <dragonfly826[m]> But perhaps I missed something
01:49:30 <FieryBinary> Let me check
01:50:20 <FieryBinary> Wait - disabling third party cookies, fingerprinting, etc often breaks video calls. Did you do any of thsoe?
01:50:20 <dragonfly826[m]> With regards to permissions. Are there any system apps that graphene denies acsess to anything?
01:50:52 <dragonfly826[m]> Ohhh, might be! Let me try
01:57:02 <dragonfly826[m]> OMG
01:57:03 <akc3n> dragonfly826[m]: Just out of curiosity, are you doing all this in the owner profile? Or a secondary  profile? ( was just trying to catch up on reading your questions you had posted in the offtopic room prior)
01:57:09 <dragonfly826[m]> I figured it out
01:57:53 <dragonfly826[m]> By saving the website onto my home screen and starting it through there, it just, works????
01:58:11 <dragonfly826[m]> Interesting phenomenon?
01:58:22 <dragonfly826[m]> This is the owner profile
02:02:58 <dragonfly826[m]> Does anyone know why this may be?
02:03:15 <dragonfly826[m]> I'm just relived to have this working :)
02:03:24 <dragonfly826[m]> But now I'm curious
02:04:04 <timetravelingman> It's a web app
02:04:11 <timetravelingman> That's all I could think of
02:06:41 <FieryBinary> dragonfly826[m] Hooray!
02:06:54 <timetravelingman> What is the website btw?
02:50:58 <dragonfly826[m]> Zoom
02:51:42 <dragonfly826[m]> Thank you to everyone who spent time helping me, really greatful!!
03:12:57 <magicspringroll[> Is there a way to install microG into Graphene or a chance for a support in the future
03:16:39 <akc3n[m]> <magicspringroll[ "Is there a way to install microG"> No, microG is not supported.

03:22:38 <skwisgaar[m]> magicspringroll: having microg requires compromising the security model of the android phone. Additionally, microg is a half-baked project not up to GrapheneOS standards. The stub implementation coming in the future will resolve some of the issues users have without having google play services.

03:26:13 <akc3n[m]> magicspringroll: it had been discussed here in the past. I've just saved some of the explanations and quoted from the devs and project members regarding microg, etc. There in my reply. Hope that helps answer your inquiry.
03:26:24 <magicspringroll[> <skwisgaar[m] "magicspringroll: having microg r"> Pardon me but what is stub implementation and will it make strict gps apps run better?
03:29:53 <skwisgaar[m]> magicspringroll: the website explains it better than I could https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
03:31:46 <skwisgaar[m]> It‚Äôs tricking apps into thinking play services exists but pretending google play servers are offline
03:31:52 <skwisgaar[m]> So if the app only cares whether gplay services exists (and doesn‚Äôt depend on it) the app will work
03:33:07 <magicspringroll[> For me I have a bank app and other apps that requires microg atleast..if that issue will be solved in any foss secure implementation ill switch in a heartbeat
03:36:00 <Jacobsin[m]> You could use a progressive web app for many banking services. That would typically sandbox the "app" in the context of the browser which in theory is more secure and in the case of a bank app that abuses permissions is also more private. Just a thought
03:36:56 <skwisgaar[m]> magicspringroll: it‚Äôs going to be an extremely useful feature that I hope gets adopted by other projects since it will be a much better option than microg

03:44:27 <th4ntis[m]> So I'm planning on installing Graphene on a Pixel 4a 5G - am I still able to use SOME Google Apps/Services? There's a couple apps I have to use for work that use google as a backup service and other things. Is that still possible with Graphene?
03:45:23 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: that was beautiful, thank you hahaha

03:45:39 <TheJollyRoger> th4ntis[m]: If those apps have been written to be able to function in the absence of Google Play Services, you totally can. If their developers however wrote them without a way to function without Play, then they may behave in odd ways, including crashing when they try to connect or exiting unexpectedly.

03:50:03 <TheJollyRoger> th4ntis[m]: I think you'll have to just try it and see. If Microsoft has written their apps to function without needing Play Services, it'll run. That's the only requirement, aside from supporting a recent version of the API for an Android app to run on GrapheneOS.
03:50:50 <th4ntis[m]> my plan is to install Graphene and install and get everything I need before I swap over to the new phone

03:52:49 <TheJollyRoger> th4ntis[m]: Yeah, Signal, and other apps that aren't written to be dependent on Google frameworks will run happily on GrapheneOS.
03:54:12 <th4ntis[m]> Very awesome. So far there's only 3 that I need for work, DuoMobile, Microsoft Authenticator, and Mattermost. Past that everything should work.
03:54:20 <TheJollyRoger> Great!

03:54:45 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent!
03:56:27 <Jacobsin[m]> I have a perhaps strange question, I have had graphene on a pixel 4a and the audio output through the headphones is extremely quiet. I can barely hear it when it is turned all the way up. Is this something that others have experienced? Is the device naturally very quiet (I didnt even play with it before wiping it and installing graphene).
03:59:07 <TheJollyRoger> Anyone with a 4a able to chime in on this?

07:02:52 <M4udr4n[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Anyone with a 4a able to chime i"> Just installing, will let you know if I get the same.
07:31:15 <Thatcher[m]> <Jacobsin[m] "I have a perhaps strange questio"> I use headphone jack on the 4a for audio a lot. First thing I noticed when I first used it was how quiet it was compared to the S7 Edge I switched from. It is not hard to hear, just a bit more quiet than other devices I'm used to.  If you have a hard time hearing it at full volume then I'd say you have a defective unit.
07:39:57 <Thatcher[m]> The 4a has a better DAC compared to most other brands of devices and the result is higher dynamic range and can make audio seem quieter because the audio is not being compressed as much. Compression of audio brings the quiet sounds and the loud sounds closer together so you can hear everything better.
07:50:59 <Thatcher[m]> I was quite surprised by the DAC on the 4a. It is quite good for a budget device. The Pixel 4a should play audio at the same volume regardless of which operating system you are running, unless stock Pixel digitally enhances the audio (which I am not a fan of).
09:46:09 <Eddy[m]> <Jacobsin[m] "I have a perhaps strange questio"> If its really a problem, try using a player that has a preamp such as vlc. Its got a pretty good preamp,with no noticeable distortion
10:38:36 <pislem> Are there some special hoops to be jumped through (like writing some extra code for existing apps) to use the wide angle camera on a pixel 5? Freedcam lists 4 cameras, 2 of which don't produce an image, the other being the regular and front facing cameras. OpenCamera refuses to acknowledge the existence of an extra backwards facing sensor.
12:23:41 <stubbornant[m]> Hi guys, if I install micro g on one user for apps that depend on google services, do I compromise the privacy of my main user with only open source apps and no google services?
12:25:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Any user app can't communicate across other user profiles from where it is installed
12:37:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X‚Äãa_bi> Microg is only useful for corona tracking and gcam
12:45:14 <stubbornant[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Xa_bi> Microg is only useful fo"> Also for taxi apps it seems
12:45:53 <stubbornant[m]> I get a message saying that the app does not work without google services
12:53:51 <dazinism> Can't use microG to do all the stuff it's designed to do just by installing its apk on GrapheneOS.
12:54:12 <dazinism> Theres some chance it may stop some apps refusing to start
12:54:34 <dazinism> But its also equally likely to break other apps in the same user profile
12:55:38 <dazinism> Eg. I think signal would see it and change to trying to use Googles push messaging that will not work. So you'd get no messages.
12:56:47 <Guest92752> hey folks. i'd like to put in a plea here to support devices for longer than 3 years. i'm very interested in the security and privacy of grapheneos, but to date, i haven't been able to run it because i refuse to purchase a brand new phone, only to have it be unsupported 3 years later. my phones generally last 5-10 years, despite having pockets full
12:56:47 <Guest92752> of dirt and wood chips on a daily basis. more than security and privacy, i'm conserned about the environment and the fact that folks are buying new phones every 2-3 years. it's insane. i'm currently an iphone user (and it should be said, i do not like ios at all) but it's mostly because i'm able to run a phone for many more years than any android
12:56:48 <Guest92752> phone. case in point, i'm currently running an iphone 6s from 2016, and i just got a security update this morning. also case in point, i have two nexus10s and two nexus5s that are physically flawless, and far more capable, but are paperweights because they stopped getting updates.
12:58:29 <dazinism> Guest92752: GrapheneOS depreciates devices when they stop receiving security updates from their vendor
13:00:11 <dazinism> As the component firmware updates are signed and can not be updated by anyone else
13:02:07 <Guest92752> wow. that's planned obsolescence on a scale that's really frightening.
13:02:17 <philnthropic[m]> This is why open firmware, hardware and software are the Holy Grail for all devices.
13:03:02 <dazinism> Its for good security reasons. Don't want other people updating that stuff.
13:04:06 <Guest92752> i don't know. i can't say i trust any of the vendors more than i trust open source code.
13:04:25 <Guest92752> google in particular is just an information vacuum.
13:04:46 <dazinism> Guest92752: so the last firmware update for the Pixel 2 was in December (I think - about then) and the device ends up with more and more publically known vulnerabilities
13:04:56 <Guest92752> are their any vendors that have open source firmware, or are heading in that direction?
13:05:14 <dazinism> Having said that GrapheneOS is still doing legacy releases for Pixel 2
13:05:30 <dazinism> Just its recommended to move to a different device
13:05:39 <entry1[m]> <Guest92752 "hey folks. i'd like to put in a "> 4a is $349 brand new and has updates until August 2023 (2 years 4 months). You can just install stock Android when you're done and sell it for prob $125 when you're done. Not expensive at all.
13:05:55 <dazinism> And its certain they will end when Android 12 is released
13:06:24 <Guest92752> oh yeah, i'm aware. we stopped using our nexus5s shortly after google support terminated. but that phone essentially only existed from 2015 to 2017, which is insane to me.
13:08:38 <Guest92752> and the nexus10 is the same story. tbh all i want to do on that is run firefox and netflix, and it's 100% capable, but because the vendor, in this case, i think it was LG killed support it's not safe anymore. it's a real shame to have this device that was pulled together out of the earth and now it's essentially landfill.
13:08:43 <dazinism> All devices are so complex, even if everything was open it would be hard to really be able to do things in a way where you didn't have to trust the vendor
13:10:30 <dazinism> Eg. The linux kernel is so complex that even known bugs don't get addressed. Let alone there being time for people to properly assess/audit every contribution
13:11:02 <dazinism> Theres masses of code, thats written by Google developers included in the linux kernel
13:11:15 <Guest92752> yeah but at least the linux kernel isn't being dumped every 2-3 years.
13:11:45 <dazinism> So if you are running anything that uses the linux kernel you effectively have to have trust in Google
13:11:53 <Guest92752> imagine if you had to throw out every computer you had every 3 years? how is this any different?
13:12:06 <dazinism> I know its not great
13:13:23 <nscnt[m]> You've come to the wrong place for your plea. It's basically out of the project's control. If the project had its own hardware, it could have some influence, but that's it
13:13:40 <dazinism> Theres a huge amount of people running android devices which don't get security updates. Just that is not what the focus of GrapheneOS is
13:14:08 <Guest92752> i'm not sure that's accurate, we don't have to trust in google, because the linux kernel IS open source. yes, you're correct that it's not 100% audited, but the fact is anyone can look at it at any time. google has incentive to not be nefarious because when they get caught it's terrible publicity. in these phones with closed firmware, they can do
13:14:08 <Guest92752> anything they want.
13:14:17 <dazinism> Guest92752: all laptops and PCs also suffer the same fate. Just it isn't really talked about
13:14:59 <dazinism> Even if everything is open and can be updated theres generally nobody doing that work
13:15:57 <Guest92752> that's untrue. there are many "LTS" os's that have timelines of almost 10 years.
13:16:21 <dazinism> The stuff that can't be updated, except by vendor, on Android devices is the firmware for components - like WiFi, screen etc.
13:17:15 <nscnt[m]> Guest92752: You're mixing OS with firmware etc.
13:17:18 <dazinism> Laptops and PCs also need these updated. Just because you can run a LTS OS doesn't mean that those components are getting firmware updates
13:17:43 <nscnt[m]> It's offtopic anyway
13:17:45 <Guest92752> how is that? is a phone not a processor with memory and a bunch of devices like screen, accellerometers, etc, like a computer? why do they seem so much more black box?
13:18:02 <dazinism> Its kind of similar to running LineageOS on a device that no longer gets vendor security updates
13:19:18 <Guest92752> yeah, which TBH is probably exactly what i'm going to do when my iphone kicks the bucket, but the reality is i would rather run graphene, but it's not accessible to me.
13:19:39 <hypokeimenon[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
13:20:49 <dazinism> DivestOS does its best to secure older devices. Its a whole different project with different goals to GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS is trying for best security possible.
13:21:51 <Guest92752> yeah i'm seeing that. i guess aiming at perfection is a worthy goal, but it does make sense then that you're severely limited in device support.
13:22:27 <nscnt[m]> Guest92752: You won't gain anything if you choose to run LineageOS vs GrapheneOS after EOL. LineageOS doesn't provide you the necessary firmware updates etc. GrapheneOS is just transparent about it and upfront communicates it's insecure now
13:22:28 <Guest92752> is there a concern that firmware is totally out of your hands though? that seems bonkers to me. i mean firmware can do literally anything.
13:22:47 <hypokeimenon[m]> Guest92752 Broad device support isn't an explicit goal of the project, atm.
13:23:19 <dazinism> Guest92752: GrapheneOS has clearly defined focus and goals. That doesn't include support of a wide range of devices. That would heavily distract from the focus/goals
13:25:36 <Guest92752> yeah, i'm understanding that. i'm not arguing (i know this is the internet and all). while i understood the focus and goals of graphene, i didn't think that firmware was quite so important a foundation.
13:25:49 <nscnt[m]> No alternative OS for your Android phone can fix your plea
13:26:56 <dazinism> Guest92752: there ends up being publically known unpatchable vulnerabilities - eg. known WiFi exploits
13:27:14 <nscnt[m]> Present your plea to the vendors
13:29:01 <dazinism> Guest92752: its sad, but theres so many devices and such complexity, that even if it was possible for anyone to fix things, their generally wouldn't be people fixing them. This is the case for lots of stuff already
13:29:19 <dazinism> *there generally
13:31:55 <Guest92752> thanks for taking the time to talk this out with me. i understand grapheneos a lot better now, or at least the ramifications of your scope and goal decisions.
13:32:06 <dazinism> Guest92752: with the Nexus 6p I think it was only a few months before serious unpatchable vulnerabilities existed. You can see stuff if you look at the monthly android security bulletins.
13:33:19 <Guest92752> that's crazy to me. i don't understand firmware enough to grasp the concept of an unpatchable vulnerability.
13:34:25 <dazinism> Guest92752: GrapheneOS has troubles keeping up with its desired baseline - let alone adding more features it desires. Wide device support is well beyond what could be practical/possible
13:35:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Manufacturers often only allow signed firmware updates from themselves.
13:36:03 <Guest92752> @dansinism yeah i can see that. sometimes i think we're making things way too complicated for our own good.
13:36:19 <dazinism> Guest92752: its unpatchable because firmware updates need to be signed by vendor and Google stopped doing updates.
13:36:54 <Guest92752> oh, not because google was like, we literally can't fix this.
13:37:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Not receiving updates doesn't mean you should replace your phone though, unless you need it to be secure.
13:37:29 <dazinism> Guest92752: I'd kind of be somewhat inclined to agree. The amazing complexity of the web, modern IT devices etc. makes it very hard to get/keep a grip of stuff
13:38:46 <Guest92752> it's my personal surveillance device, er, phone, of course i need it to be secure.
13:38:49 <Guest92752> :)
13:38:59 <Guest92752> ¬†:)
13:39:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Nice
13:40:07 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's on Qualcomm and Google deal of SoC having 3 years of update and the branch of Android LTS kernel support timeline too
13:41:06 <dazinism> If you want the best security available you need a device thats getting security updates from the vendor. Also the vendor has to do a decent job of putting everything together in the first place.
13:41:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Yeah if you need security then replace your device. Sell/give your old phone to someone who needs it.
13:41:19 <Guest92752> yeah 100%.
13:41:34 <dazinism> Pretty much chose an iPhone or a Pixel
13:41:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> As long as you do that the environment will be fine.
13:41:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Basically yeah
13:42:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Fiery> Not receiving updates d"> It is not a good idea to have insecure devices out and about unless you are using them for research, tinkering or education etc.
13:43:11 <dazinism> There are some android devices that get longer periods with full updates (it's the deal the vendor does with Qualcomm )but they don't get updates every month, which is also a problem
13:43:28 <dazinism> As you have known vulnerabilities until the next uodate
13:43:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Obviously should be careful with what you download and do
13:43:55 <dazinism> Getting fast updates is pretty improtant
13:44:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Better to use an insecure device than contribute to e waste
13:45:07 <dazinism> Yeah, I'm somewhat sympathetic, also many people in the world can't afford new devices.
13:45:41 <dazinism> Still if security is important theres known options
13:46:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Fiery> Could always donate to poor people who need it
13:46:09 <Guest92752> you mentioned divestos, any others that come to mind?
13:46:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> I guess is Fairphone a better option from an environmental perspective? I mean I already only buy second hand devices
13:47:23 <dazinism> Guest92752: no nothing else I know of does the stuff they do. Much if what they do is automated and they don't/can't test releases
13:47:45 <dazinism> We straying well off topic though.....
13:48:35 <Guest92752> ¬†yeah, sorry about that. thanks again everyone. i haven't used IRC in like 20 years, and i'm suddenly missing it. it's like the internet, but not horrible. :)
13:48:45 <dazinism> #grapheneos-offtopic
13:49:12 <dazinism> Or #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org if anyone on matrix want to continue
14:02:27 <dazinism> Guest92752: laptops and PCs have the same kind of component firmware as phones. Also need security updates to remain secure. Depends on the vendor how long these updates are provided
14:02:43 <dazinism> Just this isn't often discussed
14:05:19 <dazinism> Guest92752: also concerning nefarious contributions to linux kernel - its entirely possible to disguise nefarious code as bugs.
14:06:45 <dazinism> Theres even competitions to do so https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underhanded_C_Contest
14:08:04 <dazinism> The huge ever increasing complexity and monolithic design of linux is a problem thats likely unsolvable. Other than using something else.
14:10:00 <dazinism> As time passes alternatives will be adopted (also that is on the GrapheneOS roadmap)
15:06:52 <noob> Hi GrapheneOS enthusiasts
15:07:20 <noob> Is there any 'check for OS updates' button somewhere?
15:07:39 <noob> How do I know I am running the latest stable version of it?
15:09:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> see the build number at about phone at settings, then compare it to latest release at https://grapheneos.org/releases

15:11:15 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <noob "OK, is there automatic update wh"> Yes, if seamless update client is enabled
15:11:41 <noob> Any idea how to update?
15:11:53 <noob> I mean how to enable?
15:12:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <noob "I mean how to enable?"> It's enabled by default btw, it should be automatic when there is connection

16:04:16 <bikeman1234[m]> when I enter another profile, is the owner profile completely at rest, like BFU mode?
16:06:18 <humblestaff> trying to install FDroid on another profile through their website, after downloading and hitting install I get message "app not installed"
16:08:04 <humblestaff> I have read this is might be because im downloading a later/earlier version, is this the proble or can it be something else?
16:09:03 <th4ntis[m]> So, I'm trying to install GrapheneOS to a Pixel 4a, and once I go to 'FlashFactory images' section of the WebUi installer, I click 'Flash Release' and it works for a bit, but now it says 'Error: Unable to claim interface' and the phone has 'fastbootd' at the top and it says 'GrapheneOS Fastboot' with the device info underneath it. Do I try and reboot it or go to the bootloader and try this again or?
16:13:11 <Redsparrow[m]> hi

16:17:17 <humblestaff> Ok thanks Ill try it off their github. the main reason I was downloading fdroid was to actually get aurora is their another way installing it?

17:02:42 <nscnt[m]> Secondary users can also run in the background. This is the reason why GrapheneOS has implemented the "End session" button.

17:24:23 <bikeman1234[m]> when i delete sms in the pre-installed sms app, are they permanently deleted or can they be recovered with forensic tools?
17:24:36 <strcat> bikeman1234[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
17:25:16 <strcat> reliable data deletion requires deleting encryption keys taking advantage of hardware integration which is what happens when deleting profiles or doing a factory reset
17:25:32 <strcat> there is no such thing as reliably wiping data from a normal SSD/HDD
17:25:51 <strcat> without deleting keys designed to be reliably deleted
17:27:02 <bikeman1234[m]> <strcat "there is no such thing as reliab"> doesn't signal and wickr do that?
17:27:11 <strcat> no, neither of those do that
17:27:30 <strcat> AOSP defaults to using secure erase and the truncate journal mode for SQLite, which is something we implemented and upstreamed, but that does not provide *reliable* deletion of data
17:27:45 <strcat> it means that at a high level, the data is no longer present in files after being deleted
17:28:08 <strcat> but as I said above, reliable data deletion requires deleting keys derived via hardware support providing reliable deletion
17:28:33 <strcat> zeroing data in a file or reducing the file to 0 size means the data isn't in the file anymore
17:28:42 <M0s_and_1s[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/
17:28:42 <M0s_and_1s[m]> Has anyone had success running this?
17:28:44 <strcat> but does not mean it isn't present on storage at a lower level
17:29:33 <bikeman1234[m]> ok, is there any way to keep sms-messages out of the owner profile then? so they only go to another profile? In the link you sent it says Our recommendation for a high security setup is to use the owner profile only for managing other profiles. Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile
17:29:47 <bikeman1234[m]> But how can that be done with sms
17:30:55 <entry1[m]> <bikeman1234[m] "But how can that be done with sm"> SMS are not e2ee. Your carrier still has all them logged, with location data, even if you successfully delete them locally.
17:31:44 <strcat> bikeman1234[m]: carrier-based calls and texts are not secure or private and should be avoided
17:31:53 <strcat> I also think that people are misinterpreting the information we give in that section
17:32:04 <bikeman1234[m]> <entry1[m] "SMS are not e2ee. Your carrier s"> in my country it is illegal or carriers to save the contents of SMS, only time and place and receiver
17:32:05 <strcat> there is nothing unsafe or particularly bad about using the owner profile for regular usage
17:32:24 <strcat> we simply explain that there is an advantage of having data in a user profile which can be kept at rest when the device is being used
17:32:38 <strcat> perhaps that needs to be reworded so that people treat it as a less urgent thing, because that's not the intention
17:32:48 <strcat> I do not expect most people to use a secondary user profile as their main one
17:33:05 <strcat> it's a recommendation for a particularly high security setup where you can afford the inconvenience
17:33:20 <strcat> and want to take advantage of being able to use the device with the bulk of your data being at rest
17:33:28 <strcat> by not being logged into your main profile
17:33:55 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Hey all, so I am upgrading to a newer and nicer pixel. The new install all went good. I want to revert the old pixel back to google so I can sell it. I see the steps in the flashing guide... however were do I get the stock image from?
17:36:24 <bikeman1234[m]> <strcat "and want to take advantage of be"> > by not being logged into your main profile
17:39:54 <TheLoneWanderer[> The owner profile is always active and running
17:40:15 <TheLoneWanderer[> Same for other profiles unless you explicitly end the session
17:42:16 <strcat[m]> bikeman1234: read what's written in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption again
17:42:22 <strcat[m]> I think we do a good job explaining it
17:42:31 <strcat[m]> I don't really understand what we're not explaining well enough

17:57:53 <nscnt[m]> > Does that mean the owner profile is completely at rest when im logged in to another profile? I was told the opposite here earlier
17:57:54 <nscnt[m]> He wrote "main" profile, not owner. The FAQ presents an approach to dealing with different profiles, where the profile you use most of the time is called the main profile. What I said before is true.
18:01:14 <nscnt[m]> The main profile would be a secondary profile whose session you can put to rest.
18:01:19 <strcat[m]> I removed the 1st sentence from that paragraph to help clarify it
18:01:23 <strcat[m]> it wasn't helpful to give a recommendation rather than simply explaining
18:01:37 <strcat[m]> in general we're not going to give recommendations and will let users choose what they want to do based on the information we present
18:02:06 <strcat[m]> I think it was unhelpful to say we recommend using a secondary profile as the main profile for high security setups because people made assumptions about the reasoning for that rather than realizing it was solely based on what we wrote afterwards
18:02:40 <strcat[m]> I also think it was misleading to word the recommendation the way we did
18:02:45 <strcat[m]> anyway, that's removed now
18:03:08 <strcat[m]> it's very difficult to expand the content on the GrapheneOS site due to how it gets interpreted
18:03:28 <strcat[m]> it needs to be near perfect and written to avoid being misinterpreted
18:04:10 <strcat[m]> could add back a clearer recommendation but it needs to be more carefully worded to avoid misinterpretation
18:04:25 <strcat[m]> it is not insecure / harmful in any way to use the owner profile for regular usage
18:04:29 <strcat[m]> that is NOT what our site was saying
18:04:38 <strcat[m]> it is NOT like an administrator user on a traditional desktop OS at all
18:05:18 <strcat[m]> all our documentation is trying to explain is that the owner profile always has to be active, and secondary profiles do not, therefore there is an advantage of using a secondary profile as your main one
18:05:42 <strcat[m]>  * all our documentation is trying to explain is that the owner profile always has to be active after the initial unlock and must be unlocked before using any profiles
18:05:45 <strcat[m]>  * all our documentation is trying to explain is that the owner profile always has to be active after the initial unlock and must be unlocked before using any profiles
18:06:05 <strcat[m]> secondary profiles do not need to be unlocked to use the device and can be put back at rest without a reboot, therefore there is an advantage of using a secondary profile as your main one
18:06:12 <strcat[m]> that is the sole basis for the recommendation that was given

18:48:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> How long does it usually take to newer pixels get latest update?
18:54:11 <akc3n[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!yume> How long does it usually"> Hi yume, by chance do you mean how long does it take for a GrapheneOS release to become available for a new Pixel phone after it comes out?
18:56:42 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
18:57:00 <strcat[m]> if you're wondering about the latest release, it's in the Beta channel
18:57:30 <strcat[m]> if you want to get the releases right away when they're announced, you can help with testing them in the Beta channel, which includes reporting issues on the tracking ASAP before we move them to the Stable channel
19:03:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Alright gonna try beta then
19:03:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> I hope i can help with fixing issues if there will be any
19:21:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Is there any big differences between beta and stable?
19:23:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> And did i understand this "it's not possible to downgrade unless a downgrade update package is generated" correctly like you cant flash from beta to new stable?
19:25:06 <skwisgaar[m]> Beta is for testing new releases of the OS to make sure they are working correctly. Once betas are tested, they are pushed to stable.
19:25:55 <skwisgaar[m]> So the beta just means getting an update as much as a few days ahead of time, at the risk of some things not working. But it‚Äôs very helpful to the devs if you can join the beta and report issues.
19:27:10 <skwisgaar[m]> If you update to a beta and it‚Äôs not working as expected, you can‚Äôt downgrade to a previous stable release. But you can update once a new release comes out.
19:29:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Alright thanks for answer
19:32:55 <akc3n[m]> yume: you are able to switch back to Stable channel at anytime to stop receiving releases from the Beta channel. However, as mention already, you aren't able to downgrade without reflashing ( "for fundamental security / robustness / compatibility reasons " ).
19:34:37 <Dendel> Hi all...so I just write my question here?
19:34:45 <strcat[m]> yes
19:34:54 <strcat[m]> it's just a chat room
19:35:15 <Dendel> Does anyone have experience with phones ordered from Back Market?
19:37:07 <Dendel> I got a sim-lock free Pixel 3, however I tried every procedure I could find to un-grey the "OEM unlocking" option
19:37:50 <akc3n[m]> <Dendel "Does anyone have experience with"> > You need one of the officially supported devices. To make sure that the device can be unlocked to install GrapheneOS, avoid carrier variants of the devices. Carrier variants of Pixels use the same stock OS and firmware with a non-zero carrier id flashed onto the persist partition in the factory. The carrier id activates carrier-specific configuration in the stock OS including
19:37:50 <akc3n[m]> disabling carrier and bootloader unlocking. The carrier may be able to remotely disable this, but their support staff may not be aware and they probably won't do it. Get a carrier agnostic device to avoid the risk and potential hassle. If you CAN figure out a way to unlock a carrier device, it isn't a problem as GrapheneOS can just ignore the carrier id and the hardware is the same.
19:39:12 <Dendel> If it is/was a carrier locked device, how can I trace the carrier?
19:40:26 <piggu[m]> <bikeman1234[m] "in my country it is illegal or c"> they do anyway, depending on the operator
19:42:35 <akc3n[m]> <Dendel "If it is/was a carrier locked de"> Search online for imei carrier lock check?
19:42:47 <piggu[m]> much like suposedly KI contents never leave AUC and it's very common to see otherwise in EU telcos
19:47:23 <Dendel> IMEI check comes back as "clean" on the https://imeicheck.com/imei-check
19:48:01 <strcat[m]> that's not a check for this
19:48:53 <Dendel> Any suggestions to check carrier lock?
19:49:48 <strcat[m]> I would have recommended against buying a legacy phone model, particularly one from a source not making it clear if it's an unlocked one
19:49:55 <piggu[m]> strcat btw thank you on keeping up grapheneOS :) you rox <3
19:50:07 <strcat[m]> Dendel: `getprop ro.boot.cid`with `adb shell`
19:54:02 <Dendel> strcat[m]: I'll double check. Did scan the entrier properties, but not this particular variable

20:02:34 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Bump :)
20:03:12 <Dendel> ro.boot.cid = "000001"
20:05:20 <strcat[m]> yes so it's a locked device
20:05:23 <strcat[m]> probably a Verizon one
20:05:41 <strcat[m]> tacticalnewfy: https://developers.google.com/android/images
20:06:15 <Dendel> :')
20:06:44 <strcat[m]> Dendel: Verizon ones can't be bootloader unlocked
20:07:07 <strcat[m]> they simply don't like people being able to install another OS
20:07:15 <strcat[m]> so if you buy a phone from them, it's not permitted
20:07:23 <strcat[m]> and you got one someone bought from them presumably
20:09:16 <Dendel> I was look for this emoji¬†'=(
20:13:02 <Dendel> So Back market is a good place to buy a sim lock free phone, bacuse it can still be hidden carrier locked. Good thing is that I can return it. Where is a good source to buy a non carrier locked, sim unlocked, OEM unlockable phone?
20:13:22 <Dendel> is good = not good
20:16:21 <m2tu[m]> anyone know why SoundPicker ringtone/notification app from settings need sdcard to be runned ?
20:16:24 <Gozer99> I ran into that same problem with Back Market and had to return the phone. I ended up buying one through swappa.com and verified that it could be OEM unlocked before purchasing.
20:18:04 <Gozer99> I also got one from eBay where the seller specifically stated that the phone could be OEM unlocked.
20:18:51 <Gozer99> Both were Pixel 4 XLs
20:20:04 <Dendel> Thanks guys! I'll take your advice and explicitly ask if it can be OEM unlocked before purchasing
20:20:59 <strcat[m]> Dendel: also strongly recommend getting current generation devices
20:21:01 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 won't last long
20:21:08 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
20:21:26 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5 is 2 years newer than the Pixel 3 so it will be supported at least 2 years longer, potentially more
20:21:46 <strcat[m]>  * Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 are 2 years newer than the Pixel 3 so they will be supported at least 2 years longer, potentially more
20:24:15 <Dendel> strcat[m]: yes, you are correct. My intention was to play around with a refubished cheaper phone, so it won't hurt so much when I screw things up flashing the device
20:26:01 <strcat[m]> Dendel: flashing is very low risk especially via web installer
20:26:26 <strcat[m]> Dendel: Pixel 4a (non-5G one) is the best budget option
20:29:13 <ryanrambharose[7> how about the 3a?
20:32:41 <shibboleth> what, the price diff (4a 5g/4a) is like 30 bucks?
20:33:02 <shibboleth> aka a beer at a game
20:33:26 <shibboleth> which you won't be attending atm anyway :P
20:34:23 <akc3n[m]> <shibboleth "what, the price diff (4a 5g/4a) "> 499 USD for a 4a 5G and 349 USD for a 4a.
20:35:18 <shibboleth> last i looked was 30, maybe 50
20:35:43 <shibboleth> still, i get that 150 might look steep
20:37:00 <akc3n[m]> <shibboleth "last i looked was 30, maybe 50"> https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel?toggler1=Pixel+4a&toggler2=Pixel+4&toggler0=Pixel+4a+with+5G
20:37:47 <shibboleth> didn't look there
20:37:54 <shibboleth> i don't have a play account and i never will
20:39:40 <strcat[m]> 4a was $349 new, 4a (5G) is $499
20:40:27 <shibboleth> well, the 4a was more expensive where i looked
20:40:58 <shibboleth> still, both are good devices and the 5g-part is mostly a novelty at this point
20:53:05 <blakkhakis[m]> so I downloaded aurora store through gitlab, and now I have an apk.zip file, how do I run this?
20:54:09 <blakkhakis[m]> was I supposed to downloade to my computer than unzip?
20:57:50 <akc3n[m]> <blakkhakis[m] "so I downloaded aurora store thr"> I think you may have downloaded the source code.
21:16:15 <skwisgaar[m]> I found that my phone thought the apk was a zip file. If you rename the file and remove the .zip it should work
21:16:29 <skwisgaar[m]> Assuming you got the right download
21:16:31 <akc3n[m]> blakkhakis: ahh I see what you mean after downloading the apk (not source code). Just rename it using the Files app, and remove the .zip
21:44:03 <cryptokid777> Hi, when using 2 profiles, do i have 2 install vpn on both, or is installing vpn on the main enough?
21:44:34 <pizzaeater69[m]> Both
21:45:46 <cryptokid777> Oke thanx, also i was reading on daniel micay twitter that grapheneos wont be releasing standalone apps via the play store from august 2021
21:46:12 <cryptokid777> Does that mean aurora store and f droid apps will not be supported on graphene from august?
21:47:43 <strcat> > grapheneos wont be releasing standalone apps via the play store from august 2021
21:47:45 <strcat> no
21:47:50 <strcat> > es that mean aurora store and f droid apps will not be supported on graphene from august?
21:47:55 <strcat> completely unrelated
21:48:11 <strcat> we're obviously not dropping support for using apps from F-Droid and the Play Store on GrapheneOS
21:48:50 <strcat> not releasing our apps via the Play Store at some point in the future (unknown when it will be) only has to do with not releasing our apps with the Play Store, as was stated
21:48:54 <strcat> does not mean completely unrelated things
21:50:25 <cryptokid777> Okey so the grapheneos apps will be bundeled in the OS?
21:52:23 <cryptokid777> Aurora store has lots of issues too bad f droid doenst have apps like signal so i dont depend on aurora
21:52:44 <strcat[m]> they already are bundled in the OS
21:52:45 <strcat[m]> it's not about GrapheneOS
21:52:53 <strcat[m]> the posts have little relevance to GrapheneOS
21:53:05 <cryptokid777> Oww okee i misunderstood
21:53:06 <strcat[m]> they were about how we're no longer going to be releasing our standalone apps via the Play Store
21:53:06 <strcat[m]> that's it
21:53:37 <cryptokid777> Sorry for the dumb question than, i misunderstood
21:53:51 <matt23> Ran into my first challenge with an app today. Traveling this weekend so loaded up the United Airlines app using an anonymous Aurora Store connection.¬† App installed ok but it will not stay in the foreground after launch. Are there any "logfiles" I could look at?
21:54:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Somehow i havent seen any problems with beta yet on pixel 4a
21:57:47 <cryptokid777> Btw , week ago i sayd my outlook mail is crashing since last update, but i tried 4 different mail apps and they all crash now, before the uodate everything worked fine, already had respond that uodate didnt changed anything related to this but its strange, all mail apps crash now
21:58:00 <princemachiavell> matt23: what do you mean by foreground? The app closes?
21:58:26 <matt23> Yes, it closes. BUt is still running in background.
21:58:26 <dannyknoll3Danny> cryptokid777: Isn't Outlook a progressive web app now?
21:58:37 <princemachiavell> cryptokid777: Use fairmail. It supports multiple accounts.
21:58:54 <cryptokid777> Okee i ll try fairmail
21:58:58 <cryptokid777> Thanks
21:59:16 <matt23> I've been using fairmail.¬† IT works well.
21:59:43 <princemachiavell> matt23: you could try manually enabling permissions for the app. Force close then relaunch.  Even better, just use their webapp if they have one.
22:00:23 <matt23> I tried giving it all possible permissions...had no effect.¬† I'll have to see if they have webapp.
22:01:59 <matt23> I thought perhaps it was throwing an error...no "system" logfiles in Android?
22:02:11 <ulmirdin[m]> cryptokid777: K-9 is good is you wanna try it, just make sure to install the most recent version from their GitHub or FDroid.
22:09:38 <strypreye[m]> Hi all, I am trying to flash GOS on Pixel 5, but I am receiving a timeout error after a few unpacking and writing cycles
22:10:21 <strypreye[m]> I am on ubuntu 20.04, chrome, have tried microsoft edge on a windows computer to no avail.
22:10:37 <strypreye[m]> Also tried switching the usb-c cable for another
22:10:43 <strypreye[m]> Really stumped here
22:14:56 <matt23> You might try using a different USB port on the computer. It sounds dumb but I had lots of problems during my install that went away completely when I switched to a different USB port.
22:15:22 <strypreye[m]> Thanks, I‚Äôll give that a shot
22:20:00 <akc3n[m]> strypreye:  are you using the web installer or cli installation method? Also, as matt23 mentioned, try a different port, and if you are using a desktop, use the USB ports at the back and not the ones at the front.
22:20:44 <strypreye[m]> Web installer. If this fails, I will try cli install
22:43:49 <strypreye[m]> Figured it out...fastboot version was out of date ü§™
22:47:10 <k4n30[m]> Is there known issues with SMS not working on secondary profile (aka not the owner)?
22:48:15 <k4n30[m]> I know don't use SMS etc. but some contacts don't understand privacy/security and will still send them üò≠
22:49:07 <k4n30[m]> I've allowed SMS and phone calls ‚Äùbe shared‚Äù and phone calls work fine, but not SMS
22:50:42 <k4n30[m]> I switched back to owner and found SMS were being received there OK, so thought it was a priority thing so turned off all the perms for the built-in messaging app, but now I don't receive them in either profile
23:06:13 <akc3n[m]> <k4n30[m] "Is there known issues with SMS n"> For example here is one open issue regarding similar situation.
23:10:12 <k4n30[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/505
23:10:24 <k4n30[m]> Found this, disregard
23:12:07 <entry1[m]> <k4n30[m] "Found this, disregard"> That's good, definitely recommended to keep stock apps if you have to rely on calls/texts.
23:14:55 <k4n30[m]> I don't want to rely on them, but unfortunately they're a part of life until majority start using "modern" communication methods
23:16:22 <entry1[m]> <k4n30[m] "I don't want to rely on them, bu"> No need to explain to me, I feel the frustration! Glad to see you found the issue.
23:17:42 <k4n30[m]> Just to clarify should I allow the stock app on the owner profile to access SMS as well? Or is just allowing the secondary profile enough?
