00:00:24 <Jack8> Then Schwab app?
00:00:31 <b1101> one of the few apps I had to let go after switching to gos. that and chase
00:00:39 <b1101> never used that
00:00:58 <Jack8> It says I have to update Google Play Services and then just has an update button.
00:01:15 <Jack8> I push update and it sits at the splash screen
00:01:32 <b1101> lol. makes sense. no play to be found
00:02:37 <Jack8> That one is kind of important for me. It is for managing money.
00:04:00 <b1101> while I love gos, it's not for everyone for that reason.
00:04:15 <b1101> some people are too dependent on apps, that are dependent on gplay
00:04:15 <usernumber33[m]> Just use their website
00:04:25 <Jack8> I'll take a minor inconvenience for major security if I can just use their website.
00:04:36 <b1101> test it out
00:07:10 <Jack8> Yeah it works and surprisingly good
00:08:47 <b1101> nice
00:11:52 <Jack8> I sent the developers an email to the email listed on the Google Play Store
00:12:05 <Jack8> Maybe they can fix it
00:15:36 <skagreek[m]> b1101: Chase was big for me, can't deposit checks now.
00:16:17 <skagreek[m]> TD ameritrade and Thinkorswim work. Interactive brokers works, but no authentication method. (for those who use these).
00:16:44 <skagreek[m]>  * TD ameritrade and Thinkorswim work. Interactive brokers works, but no automated authentication method for IBKR. (for those who use these).
00:17:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> You guys are trading on your phone?
00:17:30 <Jack8> Yeah
00:17:35 <skagreek[m]> No, just checking stuff that goes up 10% without getting in on the ride. HA!
00:17:42 <Jack8> haha
00:17:48 <skagreek[m]> But trades work as well.
00:18:00 <Jack8> USAA works too
00:18:01 <skagreek[m]> I think BofA worked last I checked.

00:18:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> What the fuck lol. I already freak out when I have to use a single monitor for trading
00:18:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Hello bois
00:18:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Hello gal
00:18:56 <skagreek[m]> I'm with out on the monitors. Two 4K monitors is a minimum.
00:19:07 <skagreek[m]>  * I'm with you on the monitors. Two 4K monitors is a minimum.
00:19:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I got a used Google Pixel 4a. Do I need to download anything before using the web installer for Graphene
00:19:40 <Jack8> I'm not a day trader.
00:19:53 <Jack8> Nope it should work technically. Just make sure you have 8GB free hard drive space
00:20:14 <skagreek[m]> Day trading is the only way to lose money. Long term is the way to win.
00:20:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Great! I am really looking forward to completely removing Google from my life
00:20:59 <b1101> skagreek[m]: I rarely deposit checks, but still have a pixel1. So if I ever really need to make a depost, I'll set it up with just wifi, without a sim, and make deposits
00:21:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> 4k seems a bit overkill. I'm fine with my monitors but I'd probably use my TV too if frigging open source nvidia driver allowed me to display 60 hz to it
00:21:34 <skagreek[m]> On my end, the chase app completely fails to load.
00:21:41 <Jack8> USAA let's me mobile deposit from the website. I got locked out for having my phone rooted once and had to do it that way
00:22:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Should I go through the hassle of using a fresh SIM or should I just pop in my old one?
00:22:12 <skagreek[m]> let's me log in and verify account, but then says "technical difficulties"  kinda the same as being rooted. They know.
00:22:27 <louipc> hey ppl this stuffs pretty offtopic. I encourage everyone to go chat in #grapheneos-offtopic channel
00:23:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Depends on your threat model ig
00:23:30 <skagreek[m]> Do telegram people see my comment as I type? Or do I need tags? I should add telegram anyway. This place is awesome.
00:23:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> David Allan Coe (@r​iffdealer) has joined the Telegram Group!
00:24:07 <skagreek[m]> Perfect!
00:24:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Wdym
00:25:23 <skagreek[m]> Anyone using a 4a 5G yet? I just installed today. Works well.
00:27:24 <b1101> skagreek[m]: I wasn't able to login. and I was able to use chase on lineage os while rooted
00:27:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Well are you still going to give that 'new' number to the same people? I personally wouldn't use a SIM with the device or only insert a one time use Sim in life or dead situations but that's why I would have a Nokia with my anyway
00:28:38 <skagreek[m]> b1101: Yeah, the rooted Chase was hit or miss for me.
00:32:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Makes me wonder.. does GOS also have a switch to automatically turn off wifi when it's disconnect for x minutes/hours/etc? If not, why not?
00:32:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Yeah I'm just gonna use the number, new or old, for the same stuff. I'm not so concerned about having a SIM in the device as I am about any possible downsides there could be to using my old card/number.
00:33:01 <b1101> skagreek[m]: didn't know that. never once had an issue with that app. I do remember trying to set up google pay once, and that noticed it was rooted/custom
00:35:14 <skagreek[m]> Even that latest root (Magisk?)with the root hiding tool didn't work for me. Odd.
00:35:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Then I don't see how there could be a problem :D
00:36:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Great!
00:36:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> What do you mean with comment? Reply to a text?
00:36:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I got a great deal on a used pixel 4a too
00:36:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> $270 and all it has is some nicks on the bezel
00:37:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Neat, I bid 240 at an auction but haven't heard from the seller yet
00:38:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I was gonna get a nexus 5 but I realized lineageos isn't supported for it anymore
00:38:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> But graphene seems way better anyway
00:38:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Plus my phone rn is literally taped together and the volume rocker broke off
00:38:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> It's the only viable option for me 😂
00:39:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> So it was time for a new phone
00:39:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> It's crazy how little I had heard about it before
00:39:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> I've been trying to cut phones out of my life entirely but I can't log in to my bank anymore without
00:40:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Yeah well there's not really a marketing team behind it as far as I know'
00:40:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I literally want one for telegram, email, 2FA and banking
00:40:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> That's it, that's all I need a phone to do besides calls and texts
00:41:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Yeah email is nice too
00:41:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> True, but even a lot of privacy - minded people seem to never have heard of it
00:41:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Ali (@b​iggayali) has joined the Telegram Group!
00:42:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> I prefer companies that get their exposure from word of mouth
00:42:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> And it's the most user friendly way to get a Google - free phone with the web installer being a thing now
00:42:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> It's very funny that to get away from google you have to get a google device
00:43:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Atleast if you don't want to walk around with an exposed phone
00:43:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> It's a Chad move to use their own branded phone to get rid of them
00:43:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Big middle finger
00:43:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Buying it used is even better because you gave them no money
00:44:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Well it's more like they actually offer hardware that can be relocked unlike other OEMs
00:44:54 <alex-resist> Wow, this Telegram bridge really makes for a terrible IRC experience
00:44:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> It's still great that their own hardware is being used against them though
00:45:08 <snooopy> alex-resist: +1 :x
00:45:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Lmao does it look like shit?
00:47:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> How do notifications work on Graphene, I heard they have issues?
00:50:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​roupAnonymousBot> I mean, the IRC experience is always terrible.
00:50:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <G​roupAnonymousBot> Yes.
00:50:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Don't take my word for it, but normally apps would use Google cloud messaging for notifications. However since there's no google service framework the app would have to fall back on a legacy implementation (if it has one)
00:52:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Man you know what I miss thinking about notifications? Those old phones with a notification LED
00:52:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> 😔
00:52:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> The join/timeout messages of IRC in telegram is quite annoying aswe
00:52:29 <Jack8> So push notifications don't work on Grapahene?
00:54:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Also would buying a used phone be even better for privacy considering the IMEI was originally tied to some other owner?
00:55:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Kind of spitballing with that one, I don't know much about phones
00:55:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> It depends on the app I suppose. I would assume it just works normally but I wouldn't be surprised if some that rely purely on google wouldn't. I'm not affiliated with GOS  or using one of their devices though so you'd probably get a better answer from an insider
00:56:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> You could buy it with cash in a store too
00:56:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Or get someone else to buy it for you
00:57:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> However once you pop your SIM which is probably on your name in, the IMEI is tied to that
00:58:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> It kind of sucked to drop $300 to get a pixel phone but once I read about all the shady crap that goes on, that instantly justified the purchase in my mind
00:59:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I have nothing to hide... Yet... But I'm not Google's pet, I don't want to be tracked 24/7
01:02:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I was tempted to just be like "ah, well, that's expensive and complicated I'll do it some other time" but that's exactly the kind of attitude that Google wants. Passivity and indifference is what got us here in the first place
01:03:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Yeah the intrusion went wayyy too far. What bothers me most is that automated programs now decide if you're a criminal or not because your phone was in range of a crime. It's obviously much more complex as that but when you also look at for example automated content deletion on youtube.. well.. there's no words for that lol
01:04:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Contact tracing must have been a wet dream for Google too
01:05:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Now they can track you even more AND look like the good guys
01:05:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> It's not like they already had that functionality lmfao
01:06:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Sure, but in my mind it is conditioning people into thinking tracking you is acceptable because muh virus
01:07:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> In fact I've known people who think that way
01:07:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> That they're willing to get tracked to help with Corona
01:09:36 <southwest[m]> <Jack8 "So push notifications don't work"> If the notifications depend on Google Play services, they will not work. Some apps allow for a background connection to provide notifications. If you search the scroll back for push notifications you will see additional info.
01:19:04 <strcat[m]> March update done other than kernels
01:19:20 <strcat[m]> 2nd quarterly maintenance release for Android 11
01:19:22 <strcat[m]> so bigger than usual
01:34:16 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL, 4, 4 XL, 4a kernels done
01:34:24 <strcat[m]> missing 4a (5G) and 5 until that's pushed to AOSP
01:34:29 <strcat[m]> so can start on builds soon
01:36:01 <strcat[m]> lot of nice bug fixes
01:36:08 <strcat[m]> since it's a quarterly maintenance release
01:36:34 <dannyknoll3[m]> Thank you.
01:38:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Just in time for my new 4a!
01:41:20 <bharr01> So my pixel2 fails web install every time so I'm trying CLI.  However, I now get several messages that "archive doesn't contain boot.sig, boot_other.img, dtbo.sig, dt.img, recovery.img, system.sig, system_other.img, vbmeta.sig, vendor.sig, vendor_other.img.  I thought I had everything downloaded and in the same directory.  Anyone know where I'm
01:41:21 <bharr01> missing these files?
01:42:57 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 web install works
01:42:57 <snooopy> strcat[m]: Is there a liste of bugfixes available somewhere?
01:43:02 <strcat[m]> bharr01: try again
01:43:07 <strcat[m]> bharr01: that problem was resolved that you ran into earlier
01:43:14 <strcat[m]> bharr01: refresh page, try web install again
01:43:17 <bharr01> Oh ok, let me give it a try
01:43:29 <strcat[m]> snooopy: security fixes are listed and they have an incomplete list of other changes
01:43:34 <strcat[m]> full list? you need to use git, etc.
01:45:19 <strcat[m]> snooopy: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/100309551
01:45:22 <strcat[m]> this is the non-security list
01:45:28 <strcat[m]> it's not complete at all though
01:45:40 <strcat[m]> it's a list of notable user-facing changes
01:45:45 <strcat[m]> kinda
01:46:04 <snooopy> strcat[m]: Thanks, the "Notable fixes:" is enough for me :)
01:46:18 <ronald439> i am trying to install graphene on a google pixel. i am installing from CalyxOS. when i try to unlock the bootloader, it gives me the error "device must be opened first" how should i fix it?
01:47:04 <strcat[m]> ronald439: which install method
01:47:12 <ronald439> web install
01:47:14 <strcat[m]> and which device specifically
01:47:25 <ronald439> pixel 3a
01:48:34 <strcat[m]> ronald439: which OS / browser are you using to perform the install?
01:48:41 <strcat[m]> Windows?
01:49:07 <ronald439> i am using Ubuntu 20.4LTS and chromium
01:49:25 <strcat> ronald439: did you install the package with udev rules it mentions? then replug in device
01:49:34 <strcat> ronald439: also note the stuff it says about USB
01:49:40 <strcat> ideally use the USB-C cable that comes with the device
01:49:56 <ronald439> i did install the package and the USB is plugged directly into my PC
01:50:27 <strcat> with the USB-C cable that comes with it?
01:50:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Does it have a certain chip with a signature in the official cable?
01:51:10 <ronald439> not the one that comes with it but one i have used for flashing ROMs in the past
01:51:33 <strcat> ronald439: cable might not be reliable enough
01:51:41 <strcat> ronald439: if you have a USB-C port try that with cable that comes with it
01:51:58 <strcat> no there's nothing special about the official cable other than it being a high quality, spec compliant one
01:52:05 <ronald439> i thought that too, but i have used this cable for flashing CalyxOS
01:52:08 <strcat> most USB-A to USB-C cables are defective
01:52:17 <ronald439> that could be it.
01:52:23 <strcat> ronald439: how did you install chromium? normal package? or something like a snap?
01:52:37 <ronald439> apt
01:52:49 <strcat> ronald439: make sure you don't have something like adb running
01:52:56 <strcat> ronald439: in bg
01:52:59 <strcat> adb spawns a daemon
01:53:03 <ronald439> ok
01:53:07 <strcat> it can break web installer
01:53:08 <ronald439> i think thats it
01:53:24 <strcat> and then after killing it restart browser
01:53:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Ah thanks for clearing that up. I usually get 20 different brands from China once in a while and keep note of the ones that work lmao
01:53:38 <strcat> (probably not necessary but may as well)
01:53:51 <strcat> the Apple, Google and Anker cables are reliably made properly
01:53:55 <strcat> don't know about other brands
01:54:02 <strcat> lots of Android OEMs make non spec compliant cables/chargers
01:54:26 <strcat> lots of PC cases have broken USB hub for their added USB ports (so using motherboard ones directly is a good idea)
01:54:32 <strcat> SOME laptops have broken ports... which sucks
01:54:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I guess I'm lucky that the used 4a I got comes with the original packaging and everything
01:54:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Yeah I don't like paying 15-20 bucks for a cable though
01:54:58 <ronald439> @strcat can only hope the laptop is not mine
01:55:07 <strcat> it's worth it because USB-C does fast charging and the crappy cables are actually a fire hazard
01:55:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Hopefully that means the original cable
01:55:57 <strcat> Pixel chargers/cables are fine to use with anything
01:56:05 <strcat> don't use random OEM chargers/cables tho
01:56:20 <strcat> like don't use some OnePlus charger to charge a Pixel
01:56:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> Well they break on me every month regardless how durable they are that's why I got tired of it and went the China route
01:56:35 <entry1[m]> One of the elements of the Android security bulletin for March 2021 made me giggle.
01:56:35 <entry1[m]> "The most severe vulnerability in this section could enable a local attacker with privileged access to gain access to sensitive data."
01:56:35 <entry1[m]> Wouldn't anyone with privileged access have access to sensitive data?
01:56:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Start about switch charger lmao
01:57:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Honestly the Nintendo official cables are probably high quality
01:58:47 <strcat> one issue is many vendors don't use standard USB-PD fast charging
01:58:56 <strcat> they use sketchy custom things
01:59:15 <strcat> and they don't necessarily check to see if it is safe like USB-PD does
01:59:36 <strcat> and they may not be safe to use with USB-PD if the phone negotiates higher than they were designed to do
01:59:38 <strcat> and they didn't cap it properly
01:59:53 <strcat> and cables are often badly made, can't handle fast charging, drop data connections, etc.
02:00:04 <strcat> also some companies make FUNDAMENTALLY broken things
02:00:13 <ronald439> I had the same problem i had with CalyxOS. i had to manualy install the bootloader unlocking tool from android.
02:00:18 <strcat> like a "USB-C extender" which is fundamentally broken unless they run 2x each cable down it
02:00:32 <strcat> and they are too cheap to do that
02:00:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> It's pretty gross when you realize how sleazy a lot of tech stuff is because they are simply banking on the average consumer just not understanding or realizing what is wrong
02:00:44 <strcat> USB standard doesn't support extension cables officially
02:02:25 <flawedworld[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Iickhitterextraordinaire> It's "> tell me about it, i bought a USB -> RS232 cable and it is single handedly the cheapest thing ive ever seen, not only did it use an unsupported rs232 chip but it had probably the thinnest copper cables inside i have ever seen.
02:02:57 <flawedworld[m]> we talking like 4 strands of tiny tiny gauge copper per usb line here
02:04:46 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: if you're around you could help review my kernel stuff, make sure I updated submodules properly
02:05:05 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: start with crosshatch (3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL), then coral (4, 4 XL), then sunfish (4a)
02:05:18 <strcat[m]> still working on redbull cause they just pushed it and there are a ridiculous amount of submodules including recursive ones so... yeah
02:05:21 <flawedworld[m]> <strcat[m] "flawedworld: if you're around yo"> yeah i can take a look, im going to bed in the next hour prob so ill use that
02:05:33 <flawedworld[m]> <strcat[m] "still working on redbull cause t"> did you look at the script i sent?
02:05:37 <strcat[m]> no
02:05:44 <flawedworld[m]> ok let me resend
02:06:24 <strcat[m]> booting Pixel 4 XL with updated everything atm
02:06:52 <strcat[m]> not the release build tho (need to redo it cause I did a build w/o updated kernel then incremental build)
02:07:11 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: how do I test refresh rate thing btw
02:07:36 <flawedworld[m]> if you go to display settings there will be an option called 'smooth display' strcat
02:08:13 <strcat[m]> yeah I enabled it for 4, 4 XL too but need to test
02:08:27 <flawedworld[m]> oh sorry i misunderstood
02:08:34 <flawedworld[m]> go to ufotest.com strcat
02:08:52 <flawedworld[m]> the framerate wont vsync but it will just to around 86-90ish
02:08:58 <flawedworld[m]> that means 90hz is working
02:09:08 <strcat[m]> uhh
02:09:12 <strcat[m]> this is some scam ad site lol?
02:09:13 <strcat[m]> typo?
02:09:28 <bharr01> strcat[m]: Got it, after clearing cache and restarting Chromium it worked!  I now have Grapheneos on my Pixel 2.  I appreciate the support!
02:09:29 <flawedworld[m]> uuhhhhh check my pull for the proper site
02:09:39 <strcat[m]> testufo.com
02:09:51 <flawedworld[m]> ah, my bad sorry about that strcat
02:09:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I'm assuming Google knows all about GOS. Are they just not doing anything about it because they know most people are never gonna use it? I know it's not illegal or anything but you'd think they would stop publishing AOSP or make their phones harder to root or something.
02:10:26 <strcat[m]> it says 60fps without disabling smooth display tho
02:10:46 <strcat[m]> ah nvm
02:10:49 <strcat[m]> it's working now
02:10:55 <strcat[m]> k it works
02:10:56 <strcat[m]> thanks!
02:10:58 <flawedworld[m]> nice!
02:11:01 <strcat[m]> should document that somewhere
02:11:09 <ronald439> Google probably wont do anything about GOS because its not worth their time
02:12:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> True but I feel like being the giant creepy tech company they are they'd be pissed that anybody is escaping their grasp, especially using their own OS and phones
02:14:18 <ronald439> you are also right with the whole not enough people though.
02:15:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Yeah, I know I'm a lot more privacy minded than most people and I hadn't even heard of GOS until yesterday
02:15:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I thought to get rid of Google I'd have to use a flip phone which is just not an option for me
02:17:27 <ronald439> alright everyone, you have all been a big help, i have one more question on theinstall. i just put in the command "cd sargo-factory-2021.02.26.16.zip" but it tells me it is not a directory. What am i doing wrong?
02:18:12 <strcat[m]> ronald439: sounds like you didn't extract it with unzip
02:18:18 <strcat[m]> prior to that
02:18:36 <mrbeanz[m]> Yeah or they have hardware backdoors we're not aware of. (Jk)
02:19:07 <strcat[m]> it's a pretty irrational and off-topic conversation for this room
02:21:36 <ronald439> @strcat i unzipped it. it still gives me thesame response
02:22:43 <strcat> ronald439: you have an extra '.zip' at the end of cd command
02:22:46 <strcat> not supposed to have that
02:22:55 <strcat> cd moves you into the directory
02:23:04 <strcat> ronald439: just type sargo<tab> and it will autocomplete it
02:23:13 <ronald439> thank you so much
02:23:39 <strcat> flawedworld[m]: I think redbull is done
02:23:41 <strcat> flawedworld[m]: *think*
02:23:45 <strcat> lot of submodules
02:24:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> What flavor of red bull
02:24:07 <flawedworld[m]> just finished crosshatch and all seems well with regard to submodules
02:24:09 <strcat> flawedworld[m]: the recursive ones are just device tree right? and neither of those got updated
02:25:26 <strcat> https://paste.xinu.at/hSZ/
02:25:27 <strcat> hate submodules
02:26:03 <flawedworld[m]> the only nested ones is everything in the vendor, which im checking rn to make sure they havent been updated
02:26:34 <dazinism> >like a "USB-C extender"
02:26:59 <dazinism> I got a double female usb C plug thing
02:27:14 <dazinism> Appears to work OK
02:27:15 <flawedworld[m]> yeah looks good with regard to recursive submodules in redbull strcat
02:27:18 <strcat[m]> dazinism: yeah that is likely broken tho
02:27:28 <dazinism> If its plugged in one way around....
02:27:31 <strcat[m]> dazinism: does it work plugged in both ways?
02:27:39 <strcat[m]> dazinism: that is the issue with it
02:27:39 <dazinism> lol
02:27:45 <strcat[m]> unless they ran 2x of each wire down it
02:27:48 <strcat[m]> then it's broken one way
02:27:58 <strcat[m]> it's not possible to make a USB-C extender the way they most likely made it
02:28:00 <strcat[m]> it doesn't work
02:28:02 <strcat[m]> they are idiots
02:28:05 <flawedworld[m]> <strcat "hate submodules"> think in future could move to an individual manifest just for the kernel? this submodules nonsense just looks set to get more painful over time...
02:28:17 <dazinism> Its real short hard plastic, just big enough to push the leads in
02:28:22 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: we could use manifest but...
02:28:27 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: then the kernel build system gets really mad
02:28:37 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: it wants you to have a clean git tree
02:28:37 <dazinism> Use if to extend my usb c hub into my phone
02:28:39 <strcat[m]> it doesn't like that
02:29:29 <dazinism> The hub has usb flash drive
02:29:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> BTW. What is unique about pixel phones that make it so GOS is only on them?
02:29:39 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: we should also probably make sure the kernel build system ignores tags for reproducible builds
02:29:44 <dazinism> So I charge and seedvault at the same time
02:30:12 <strcat[m]> Pixel phones have by far the best security in hardware/firmware among Android phones
02:30:25 <strcat[m]> and they have the quite rare property of fully supporting using an alternate OS with all security features intact
02:30:31 <strcat[m]> this has been discussed many times and is covered on the site
02:30:37 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
02:30:44 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
02:30:51 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
02:30:54 <flawedworld[m]> so https://github.com/flawedworld/platform_manifest/blob/11/default.xml was my very quick attempt at getting the bare minimum needed to build a kernel, its not how they do it in AOSP so they might help overcome some funniness...
02:31:01 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400
02:31:04 <strcat[m]> read that thread too
02:31:06 <strcat[m]> among others
02:31:22 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: the kernel build system uses git describe
02:31:26 <strcat[m]> to get version to put in uname
02:31:32 <strcat[m]> if you use manifest it will put -dirty at the end
02:31:42 <strcat[m]> and removing that doesn't fix the problem
02:31:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Ty, I'm new to this. I just find it really funny that it's Google's own devices that make for the most secure smartphones
02:32:00 <flawedworld[m]> <strcat[m] "if you use manifest it will put "> ahhhh ok now i understand where your coming from
02:32:01 <strcat[m]> why is that? they're quite good at security
02:32:13 <flawedworld[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> if you use manifest it will put -dirty at the end
02:32:13 <flawedworld[m]>  * ahhhh ok now i understand where you're coming from
02:32:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Well, from a privacy standpoint
02:32:19 <strcat[m]> and they are also generally quite open source friendly and they support installing other OSes on Chromebooks and Pixels
02:32:45 <strcat[m]> what about them is worse when it comes to privacy than say, OnePlus? Google certainly has better privacy policies and care taken for it than most corporations
02:32:49 <ronald439> wow, i get problem after problem. when i try to do the './flash-all.sh' command, it gives me './flash-all.sh: 22: [: Illegal number: 1:81
02:32:50 <ronald439> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
02:32:50 <ronald439> ' I have tried updating my fastboot to get the same result
02:32:52 <strcat[m]> you're just viewing them in the light of the fact that they are a huge corporation
02:32:58 <strcat[m]> which has tons of data based on their reach
02:33:06 <strcat[m]> but that doesn't mean they are worse in terms of those policies than most companies
02:33:18 <strcat[m]> there are companies like Apple with better privacy policies in some ways
02:33:24 <strcat[m]> but most companies are worse
02:33:38 <strcat[m]> you think stuff like your bank, credit card company, other Android OEMs are better? it's quite wrong if you think that
02:33:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> True... I guess Google isn't particularly evil, moreso just huge
02:33:49 <strcat[m]> your credit card company literally sells your purchase history to others
02:33:57 <strcat[m]> Google hoards the data themselves to use it for ad targeting, etc.
02:34:08 <strcat[m]> in fact, they buy your purchase history from your credit card company
02:34:17 <strcat[m]> but they don't sell your data like that
02:34:23 <strcat[m]> so yeah they are a big issue but so are other companies
02:34:31 <strcat[m]> and the issue of Google is mostly their reach/size
02:35:04 <grapheneos_user_> I think their services are so good that everyone uses them, for free, then go shocked Pikachu face when Google wants something in return
02:35:04 <strcat[m]> not that they are particularly bad when it comes to this, it's actually quite wrong, they are better than most companies when it comes to it (with some exceptions like Apple, and companies actually focused on privacy)
02:35:05 <strcat[m]> like, say, your dental office
02:35:06 <strcat[m]> they probably sell your data
02:35:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Yeah like I said, they are massive so that makes them seem a lot worse
02:35:17 <ronald439> yeah google is pretty creepy. i use cash where i can.
02:35:22 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "I think their services are so go"> People notice their collection more because they use Google so much
02:35:35 <strcat[m]> most companies have near 0 care for your privacy
02:35:40 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "People notice their collection m"> Or at least in many areas of life
02:35:52 <strcat[m]> Google cares a lot about security and they care about keeping your data from other companies, but not keeping your data from them
02:35:54 <strcat[m]> so they hoard data on you
02:35:56 <strcat[m]> themselves
02:36:05 <strcat[m]> and they buy your data from other companies
02:36:08 <strcat[m]> like credit card companies
02:36:11 <ronald439> cash is untraceable and accepted almost everywhere. this Covid stuff has made people not accept cash which makes me angry.
02:36:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> I also have zero desire to use Google apps so that's another reason why I want GOS
02:36:22 <grapheneos_user_> <ronald439 "cash is untraceable and accepted"> Cryptocurrency
02:36:34 <grapheneos_user_> Tho that's off topic
02:36:40 <strcat[m]> basically Google as an organization does not understand the concept that privacy includes privacy from them
02:36:50 <ronald439> exactly
02:37:00 <strcat[m]> they understand it includes privacy from other companies and do a good job of that for the most part
02:37:10 <strcat[m]> and they are really good at security
02:37:16 <grapheneos_user_> Well, they give damn good stuff in return for no privacy
02:37:26 <ronald439> grapheneos_user_ crypto is too unstable. still off topic
02:37:42 <ronald439> yeah they have great products
02:37:45 <strcat[m]> it is more nuanced than "Google evil" and as with other large corporations they have a bunch of different departments and major distinctions between the policies in those
02:37:50 <strcat[m]> and their overall policies vs what those do
02:38:11 <strcat[m]> Apple is not good, and Google is not evil, rather both are amoral
02:38:13 <strcat[m]> they are neither
02:38:16 <strcat[m]> they just want money
02:38:26 <strcat[m]> like any other corporation, basically
02:38:53 <strcat[m]> they do good if it's good for making money
02:38:56 <flawedworld[m]> things like MTA-STS for gmail and cutting edge exploit mitigations like control flow integrity in Chromium and AOSP were adopted by Google very early on if you want examples of their good security track record
02:39:26 <strcat[m]> I mean as a whole they are quite good at security, esp. compared to others
02:39:51 <strcat[m]> and if you just look at privacy policies and respect for privacy in isolation from size / reach then most companies are actually worse they just don't have the same reach to cause the same harm
02:40:03 <ronald439> did he ./flash-all.sh command not work for anyone while installing on a pixel 3a?
02:40:11 <strcat[m]> ronald439: need more details
02:40:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Also doesn't using a custom ROM dramatically increase battery life by virtue of all the tracking crap no longer running
02:40:27 <grapheneos_user_> Isn't apple slightly ahead on security? Though that's a lot because they have a closed ecosystem, Google manages security even without the stock os
02:40:38 <strcat[m]> no not really
02:40:52 <grapheneos_user_> Oh no? Then nevermind
02:40:52 <strcat[m]> I mean we're comparing AOSP / stock OS to iOS and Pixels to iPhones
02:40:58 <strcat[m]> not the trash other Android vendors make with their forks
02:41:01 <ronald439> spit out this error './flash-all.sh: 22: [: Illegal number: 1:81
02:41:01 <ronald439> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
02:41:10 <grapheneos_user_> I know I'm talking specifically about hardware
02:41:25 <strcat[m]> ronald439: sounds like you have an out-of-date / broken fastboot installed in your OS, and you didn't do the PATH part of the instructions properly
02:41:49 <ronald439> ah ok. i will try again.
02:42:03 <strcat[m]> ronald439: you need to basically start over for CLI instructions
02:42:07 <strcat[m]> ronald439: you'd be better off using web installer
02:42:10 <strcat[m]> and figuring out what is wrong
02:42:28 <ronald439> that was giving me all the problems that wouldnt recognise my device
02:42:47 <ronald439> said my device had to be opened first
02:43:11 <flawedworld[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "I know I'm talking specifically "> Well, Apple is adopting newer armv8 architectures faster than say qualcomm meaning they have things like PAC (Pointer Authentication Codes) which is only on armv8.3 and newer but thats only 1 thing and doesnt represent a black and white of which is better
02:43:49 <grapheneos_user_> <flawedworld[m] "Well, Apple is adopting newer ar"> Yeah true
02:44:16 <grapheneos_user_> Google definitely has better security when alternate OSes are considered
02:44:21 <flawedworld[m]> Qualcomm only now is moving to armv8.4 from armv8.2 with the 888 5G SoC
02:44:47 <grapheneos_user_> And Android takes junk and turns it into something amazing
02:45:04 <flawedworld[m]> For those of you who are aware of memory tagging, I think thats an armv8.5 feature if i remember right [citation needed]
02:46:01 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "Google definitely has better sec"> iOS devices don't support alternate oses and Mac security features get disabled when using alternate os

02:48:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Oh so I haven't gotten a new phone in ages, is a SIM card just drop-in or do I have to mess around with my carrier?
02:49:28 <flawedworld[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Iickhitterextraordinaire> Oh so"> The majority of SIM cards should work just fine in GrapheneOS.
02:49:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> As in can I just take it out of one device and put it in another and I'm good to go
02:49:53 <ronald439> yeah should work like that
02:54:10 <ronald439> how can i fix the problem in the web installer "Error: The device must be opened first."
02:58:08 <still-malka> Hi all, I have a sincere question about GrapheneOS. I'm trying to figure out how to flash the factory images in. When I've curled the zip file, I consistently get the message that there's an error opening the archive: "Unrecognized archive format."
02:58:16 <still-malka> I don't know how to fix this - can someone help me?
02:58:21 <TheJollyRoger> still-malka: please use the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web on Chromium or Edge, it's faster.
02:58:27 <still-malka> I'm using a Mac, and working on a pixel 4a
02:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> It will take the guesswork out of things.
02:59:28 <TheJollyRoger> curl needs to be done using a capital O, not a zero, there is no L in the command flag.
02:59:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> That's another thing. Thank you to whoever came up with the web installer. I'm retarded so using that is the only way I trust myself to install it
03:00:12 <TheJollyRoger> We suggest using the web installer. It's faster, will take less time, there is less commandline guesswork involved, you won't need to download the tools, just connect your phone and follow the instructions on the page.
03:00:17 <still-malka> Mmm that's helpful -- if I'm halfway through the installation, does that interfere with the web installer at all?
03:00:31 <TheJollyRoger> No, not at all. Just follow the web installer.
03:00:32 <still-malka> really glad y'all streamlined this, I don't generally work from the terminal
03:00:36 <still-malka> Thank you!
03:01:14 <still-malka> *command line
03:01:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, strcat and some some of the others built it, because people kept bricking their devices with out of date versions of fastboot.
03:01:24 <TheJollyRoger> So, please use it.
03:01:24 <TheJollyRoger> be back in a bit.

03:11:42 <strcat> I'll review it myself a few times
03:11:45 <strcat> building atm
03:11:50 <flawedworld[m]> aiteo, gn
03:23:57 <ronald439> when i try and use the web installer, i run into one of two problems. when my phone is unlocked and on, the website doesn't recognise my device. if i have it in the bootloader, it says the device has to be opened first.what am i doing wrong. i am installing from ubuntu 20.04LTS from chromium onto a pixel 3a. thanks in advanced
03:24:28 <strcat> it has to be in the bootloader interface
03:24:35 <strcat> that's what instructions tell you to do
03:24:43 <strcat> make sure you don't have adb running
03:24:47 <strcat> reboot your computer if necessary
03:24:57 <ronald439> how would i stop adb
03:25:07 <ronald439> i have rebooted my computer
03:25:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Since brave is chromium should the web installer work on it?
03:26:14 <strcat> sure
03:26:22 <strcat> any browser with WebUSB
03:26:27 <strcat> but we don't test / officially support Brave
03:26:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Cool
03:26:34 <strcat> we do test / officially support Edge
03:26:42 <strcat> Brave should work fine tho
03:27:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Great, I'll let you know how it goes when my phone is here
03:27:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <I​ickhitterextraordinaire> Two days I believe
03:28:37 <ronald439> i have adb disabled on my computer and i am getting the same result. what should i try differently
03:30:44 <strcat[m]> ronald439: are you granting it access?
03:30:50 <strcat[m]> did you perhaps deny it access?
03:31:12 <ronald439> i am granting access as far as i can tell
03:31:34 <strcat[m]> look in chrome://device-log
03:31:37 <strcat[m]> see what it says there
03:31:43 <ronald439> okay
03:34:05 <ronald439> so i guess i am denying access. i dont use chrome normally so how would i grant access?
03:38:29 <strcat> ronald439: when you press unlock, it prompts you for the device
03:38:34 <strcat> it sounds like you already denied it
03:38:49 <strcat> ronald439: press the lock icon next to URL
03:38:57 <strcat> ronald439: see if there's a USB device listed there that you denied
03:40:19 <ronald439> it shows pixel 3a. it dosent say the lock or unlock status
03:41:49 <strcat[m]> ronald439: press x next to that
03:41:51 <strcat[m]> try again
03:42:07 <ronald439> ok i will try that
03:50:19 <ronald439> it worked!
03:51:45 <strcat[m]> I think what happened is you denied it 1st time
03:51:50 <strcat[m]> so it remembered that you denied it
03:52:56 <ronald439> well i just went throuh the CLI instructions and it worked again for me
03:53:42 <strcat[m]> ah
04:16:01 <idkrn[m]1> youre the most active admin ive seen any of the rooms im in lol

05:23:12 <strcat> it's in control of all your text input in applications, all of it passes through it and it controls it
05:23:14 <strcat> clearly
05:23:21 <strcat> and it is the clipboard manager
05:23:39 <strcat> and the way you're trying to block network access is quite flawed anyway
05:23:41 <skagreek[m]> uninstall pending immediately!
05:23:51 <skagreek[m]> thanks
05:24:09 <strcat> I'm not really saying you should do that since you could decide you trust the app
05:24:23 <strcat> what I'm saying is that you are in no way avoiding massive trust in a keyboard app but not granting it network access
05:24:27 <mr_hebi_san[m]> You could also decompile it to see which apps it is happy to share data with.
05:24:29 <strcat> and it sounds like you *didn't* revoke Network anyway
05:25:03 <skagreek[m]> Since you guy know better on this subject, I will play it safe.
05:25:03 <strcat> the Network toggle in the OS works a lot better than the less complete way a firewall blocks access
05:25:04 <rny> lol
05:25:33 <rny> will google exfiltrate your clipboard data?
05:25:46 <rny> i'm willing to wager less likely compared to some random keyboard you install
05:25:52 <strcat> if you opt into sharing usage data it kinda leaks some data
05:26:00 <strcat> it's opt-in
05:26:05 <strcat> it nags you once
05:26:13 <strcat> asking you to
05:26:33 <skagreek[m]> Even these opt-in things, i wonder if they really do what they say.
05:26:55 <rny> in advanced? can always toggle off
05:26:56 <skagreek[m]> (or opt-out) in this case.
05:27:13 <rny> skagreek[m]: you can sue google if you find out they didnt do what they say
05:27:23 <skagreek[m]> oh i see.
05:27:26 <rny> count me in your class-action too
05:27:38 <skagreek[m]> Funny :)
05:29:27 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Now I'm curious what's in the Gboard AndroidManifest.xml
05:29:45 <skagreek[m]> I checked under mobile data & WiFi and it says 0 B data used under Gboard.
05:30:31 <skagreek[m]> Just checked off teh deny under network access, thanks
05:30:58 <skagreek[m]>  * Just checked off the deny under network access, thanks
05:33:12 <bizanon[m]> "app installations are global" does this mean all profiles have the same apps? Or can each profile have its own set of apps?
05:33:48 <strcat> bizanon[m]: no, it doesn't mean profiles have the same apps
05:33:51 <strcat> you can see that for yourself
05:33:56 <strcat> it means app installations are global
05:34:10 <strcat> they can't have different versions of the same apps
05:34:18 <strcat> if the app is installed, it's the same version installed elsewhere
05:34:34 <strcat> there is 1 installed apk and separate instances of the app (if it's installed) per profile
05:34:56 <strcat> doesn't keep a separate 100MB apk or w/e per user profile that it is installed in
05:35:10 <strcat> same apk, separate instances of the app / app data
05:36:12 <bizanon[m]> 👍
05:37:35 <strcat> once a user installed app isn't installed in any profiles, it's removed
05:53:07 <still-malka> (Thanks so much all!)
06:13:30 <bizanon[m]> Does GOS allow mobile data tethering via USB to a computer?
06:19:27 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: yes.
06:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: You've got a Pixel 5 running GrapheneOS. Go and use your phone.
06:29:45 <Jack8> I think I have 90% of the kinks worked out with GOS
06:30:09 <Jack8> I transferred my SIM to it today and I'm using it as my only phone
06:37:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Dragan has joined the Telegram Group!
07:00:27 <micky> hello. can anyone help me with the installation on a pixel 4a? When I try the web install i get "Error: Device must be opened first." I have the phone in the bootloader unlocked and plugged into my computer (HP Spectre running fresh install of Ubuntu 20.04) using the oem USB-C cable
07:02:00 <Jack8> Is the OEM unlocking enabled?
07:02:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <micky "hello. can anyone help me with t"> Have you installed udev rules as of grapheneos.org/install/web
07:04:27 <micky> I installed android-udev-rules . Is this the right package?
07:07:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <micky "I installed android-udev-rules ."> You can try, but the https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-as-non-root says it is android-sdk-platform-tools-common for Debian/Ubuntu
07:10:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <E​mints> /start
07:12:14 <micky> Just checked and yes I have it installed. Error reads the same
07:24:56 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Probably a problem within usb ports and/or cables
07:26:59 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Try plugging it on other ports nearer the motherboard
07:35:17 <micky> It still says device must be open first. does this mean to have the phone unlocked or the bootloader open and unlocked
07:41:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Please reboot your system after installing the udev rules
07:44:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> There's ways to trigger it without rebooting however
07:44:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> But I'm not willing to take responsibility for asking someone to run stuff as root
07:44:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Lol
07:45:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> udevadm trigger && udevadm control --reload-rules
07:45:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Anyway
07:45:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> It should likely work after reboot
07:46:02 <micky> rebooted and im still getting the error
07:46:25 <dakotah[m]> When is the issue?
07:48:39 <micky> I already have the bootloader unlocked, i did it a month or two ago if that matters, when i plug it in and attempt the web install the page spits back an "Error: Device must be opened first"
07:49:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Well then, what does fastboot devices say?
07:53:31 <micky> no return when i run fastboot devices
07:57:50 <micky> however the phone is connected and in fastboot mode
08:02:24 <micky> now it says "0B021JEC215537	fastboot"
08:03:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Try webusb now
08:04:51 <micky> still says device must be opened
08:09:56 <micky> when on the installation page if i click the lock by the address bar it says the phone is connected via usb. but when i click either the "unlock" or "download release" i get back the error message
08:11:14 <micky> i want to try relocking the bootloader and trying from the start again but for the life of me cant remember how thats done
08:28:43 <micky> attempting command line install now. after cd sunfish-factory-2021.02.26.16 and ./flashall.sh terminal says no such file or directory. im confused am i not in the assumed directory?
08:30:43 <micky> found typo
08:39:48 <micky> alrighty so i run ./flash-all.sh i get "./flash-all.sh: 22: [: Illegal number: 1:81
08:39:48 <micky> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html" fastboot version is 1:8.1.0+r23-5ubuntu2 and update command says everything is up to date
08:40:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> The fastboot shipped in ubuntu is too old
08:40:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> This is already covered by the installation guide
08:40:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Download the fastboot zip and run it locally
08:40:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Nobody told you to install fastboot to your system
08:41:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Currently the only OS where we support installing fastboot to the system is archlinux
08:42:24 <micky> the command line told me to install fastboot when i tried to flash without it. i didnt know how to work around so i did
08:42:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Read the installation guide
08:43:51 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210302-141332.png (220KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/PnGgkvAiyGVieNNCzjqbGvSz/Screenshot_20210302-141332.png >
08:43:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Everything is documented there
08:44:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> We only support fastboot installed to the system on archlinux
08:45:20 <micky> yes i see that now
08:46:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also if fastboot works now
08:46:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Then retry the webusb installer
08:49:22 <micky> retried, page still says open device
08:50:59 <micky> if i cant get this to work in 15 minutes ill have to log off and try again another day
09:13:07 <micky> I don't know what I did different but I deleted and reinstalled platform tools and graphene and it worked. Thank you for your help clannad and others stay safe and happy hunting
09:42:25 <mynacol[m]> <strcat[m] "flawedworld: we should also prob"> What you are saying in the citation probably doesn't affect reproducibility of the kernel. Still I ask you to not forget this goal. Reproducible builds are very nice if working, and I hope this project has the goal to get to a fully reproducible build.
09:43:08 <strcat> there are fully working reproducible builds

09:44:19 <strcat> and it has real world benefits
09:44:48 <strcat> that's the size of an update taking you from 2021.02.23.15 to 2021.02.26.16 i.e. every bit of the firmware/OS is what it should be for a clean 2021.02.26.16 install
09:44:59 <strcat> updates are block-based

09:45:24 <strcat> and since there was another recent release, that release had 2 incrementals
09:45:31 <strcat> and ofc older is bigger (more differences)
10:03:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> I know it's a bit late to jump in the Apple security convo but I know of a case where someone's iPad was remotely rooted through icloud. How feasible is this with GOS?
10:05:25 <interesting[m]> anyone knows why my graphene phone doesn't show up in windows when I connect it to pc?
10:05:41 <interesting[m]> I choose "File Transfer" in usb preferences

10:16:57 <strcat[m]> I can restart the builds for it
10:20:40 <mynacol[m]> Thanks clannad for the offer. I did not know that the OS (or at least, the kernel) is reproducible. So I have nothing to complain about 🤷‍♂️
10:24:43 <bert007[m]> Hi there, can anyone tell how I can join a google meet meeting on grapheneOS ? I installed the app through the Aurora Store app, but when launching nothing happens. When I use the link in the email invitation the web browser doesn't seem to load anything. Joining a google meet meeting via browser on a laptop does work (in my case the browser was firefox). On grapheneOS I'm using Vanadium
10:30:30 <strcat> should work via browser
10:30:35 <strcat> try desktop mode for the browser
10:43:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> No Hay has joined the Telegram Group!
10:43:50 <bert007[m]> Ok this does work indeed with Vanadium, thanks strcat
10:45:59 <bauershades[m]> How can you save a pdf document after opening it from (proton)mail app?
10:46:21 <bauershades[m]> I can't seem to save any documemts from the grapheneos pdf viewer
10:49:10 <strcat> doesn't have a save option
10:49:18 <strcat> save it from the mail application rather than opening it in that
10:49:28 <strcat> it could have that feature but doesn't atm
10:49:45 <strcat[m]> it's just a viewer
10:49:48 <strcat[m]> atm
10:49:56 <strcat[m]> can't modify (like filling out forms) / save
11:23:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Yeah thats a bummer with pm, attached stuff don't get downloaded
11:23:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> On the device
12:07:59 <noctux> hello, I was wondering: is there any reason graphene-os strictly requires a domain for wpa-enterprise connections? my old phone's wpa-enterprise-config-gui (on lineageos) did not do that...
12:12:38 <strcat> GrapheneOS works the same way as modern AOSP in most regards including all that Wi-Fi stuff
12:12:40 <strcat> not something we change
12:16:59 <noctux> oh, ok, thanks
13:11:35 <hasnoname[m]> I have homeassistant app installed on my phone and with sensors permissions enabled in the settings the app can access all the sensors even though I did not explicitly grant the access to it/them in the app. This only happens with the homeassistant app from fdroid. Aurora store app was only able to access sensors that I enabled in the app.
13:14:49 <hasnoname[m]> <hasnoname[m] "I have homeassistant app install"> Turned off the sensors permissions and turned back on. Seem to be fine now
13:15:32 <strcat> hasnoname[m]: not clear what you mean with this messages
13:15:55 <strcat> the Sensors toggle is added by GrapheneOS and therefore enabled by default for compatibility since apps aren't written to request it
13:16:05 <strcat> there aren't separate toggles for the different types of 'other sensors'
13:16:29 <strcat> there are the standard permissions and then Sensors to cover 'other sensors' (any other kinds not covered by the existing standard permissions like Body Sensors, etc.)
13:16:39 <jenkijo[m]> Hi guys
13:16:39 <jenkijo[m]> Could you recommend a good phone for run grapheneos? I really want to try it
13:16:52 <strcat> jenkijo[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
13:17:12 <jenkijo[m]> <strcat "jenkijo: https://grapheneos.org/"> thank you
13:19:25 <hasnoname[m]> <strcat "there aren't separate toggles fo"> Oh ok. Homeassistant app has given user the option to individually give it access to each sensor.
13:20:11 <strcat> hasnoname[m]: toggles in an app are not comparable to OS control over what the app can access
13:20:27 <strcat> there's a big difference between a UI in the app (controlled by the OS) and the OS UI for permissions
13:20:40 <strcat> there's a big difference between a UI in the app (controlled by the app) and the OS UI for permissions*
13:20:55 <strcat> hasnoname[m]: so you seem a bit confused
13:20:59 <strcat> about how things work
13:21:14 <strcat> the app sandbox / permission model / other access control is not a choice for apps

14:44:03 <bauershades[m]> If i understand correctly it is not a bad idea to factory reset GOS from time to time so the token in the Titan m chip is deleted. So it makes it even harder to do digital forensics
14:44:18 <bauershades[m]> If i'm wrong. Let me know haha
14:45:30 <ulmirdin[m]> Unless something is really messed up in your phone, factory reset is not necessary.

15:44:49 <Markus71> New to GrapheneOS, installed it, like it, just want to say TY
15:52:14 <bypassbobby[m]> Hello people I've been using graphene for over 6 month now. I would like to thank all of you for helping me when I installed it and give me some tips on using it. I would like to give a recommendation though on 1 new feature. On devices which are £1200 a year to use they have a wipe feature that can be accessed even from the lockscreen. Its triggered by typing a custom combination like 999 etc
15:53:27 <bypassbobby[m]> This would be a great feature and piece of mind its not quick getting into the setting menu then deleting a profile
15:55:40 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: there's already an enhancement issue filed about a duress password feature
15:56:10 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: not clear exactly what you'd expect that to do though
15:56:17 <strcat[m]> delete the currently selected profile?
15:56:45 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't really work to have it delete a different profile since each user profile can configure lock method differently, etc.
15:57:04 <bypassbobby[m]> Yes or the other profile or maybe wipe the entire phone maybe that could be customized
15:57:49 <bypassbobby[m]> The encro phones had a remote wipe feature also
15:59:13 <bypassbobby[m]> <strcat[m] "bypassbobby: there's already an "> What does this mean? Like veracrypt? Encrypted ontainer in a container?
15:59:39 <strcat[m]> don't know where you're getting that
15:59:52 <strcat[m]> bypassbobby: as a starting point please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption to understand how encryption works
16:00:05 <strcat[m]>  * bypassbobby: as a starting point please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption to understand how the storage encryption works
16:00:30 <strcat[m]> and please look at the enhancements on the tracker
16:00:34 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to work on them
16:00:53 <strcat[m]> asking for developers to work on them will increase the time it takes for them to be implemented rather than shortening it
16:01:20 <IRCX6[m]> Is there any way to install YouTube on GrapheneOS?
16:02:21 <bypassbobby[m]> In the UK they give you 6month prison for contempt of court if u fail to give them password. If you was in traffic and noticed police behind you could type 999 and wipe the phone/profile completely within seconds.
16:02:22 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: you can install whatever apps you want, I doubt Google's YouTube app works without Play services, but you're free to install it
16:02:24 <bypassbobby[m]> Getting onto the phone then going into setting then delete profile would take much longer. That's all I'm getting at
16:02:58 <IRCX6[m]> Wait my bad
16:02:58 <LinusSexTips[m]> newpipe works without play services IRCX6:
16:02:58 <LinusSexTips[m]> https://newpipe.net/

16:04:21 <strcat[m]> to help with development? yeah, unless you're going to find someone to do it and pay them
16:04:29 <strcat[m]> the finding someone part is pretty hard
16:05:57 <bypassbobby[m]> <strcat[m] "the finding someone part is pret"> OK I understand. I bet I don't know any programmers.  How much do you think it would cost to implement this feature?
16:07:03 <strcat[m]> it doesn't just have to be implemented but maintained indefinitely
16:07:07 <strcat[m]> ported to each new major version of the OS
16:07:14 <strcat[m]> and maintenanced monthly
16:07:27 <strcat[m]> it's not 1 time thing but rather long-term commitment
16:07:36 <strcat[m]> otherwise it just goes away in August/September
16:07:58 <strcat[m]> I don't know what it would cost, that largely depends on who you find to implement it
16:08:24 <strcat[m]> it's not one of our priorities at all
16:15:41 <bypassbobby[m]> Another feature I've seen on the old encrophones is when the device is off u click power button and volume up button for example and it boots in one profile. Just click power button it boots in another. These devices where very expensive so they had the money to pay different developers for these features. The problem they had is they locked the users into a certain chat system which got MITM attacked from there
16:15:42 <bypassbobby[m]> side and 60k people got all there chats leaked by authorities.
16:17:55 <bypassbobby[m]> This system lasted around 6 years until it got cracked they had servers in france. Some think it was a sting operation from the start
16:38:13 <justchill[m]> <strcat[m] "it doesn't just have to be imple"> I'm not very familiar with the internals involved here. Just to get a better understanding, what are the technical challenges involved in doing this? These are some possible ones I've thought of:
16:42:09 <strcat[m]> figuring out the design is the initial challenge
16:42:16 <strcat[m]> a user profile may not have a lock method enabled at all
16:42:34 <strcat[m]> it would be pretty hard to design it in a sensible way where it does something globally
16:42:36 <strcat[m]> rather than to the current profile
16:42:44 <strcat[m]> which therefore makes it a lot less interesting, I think
16:43:06 <strcat[m]> it's easier to design it if it's simply a button with confirmation rather than a password
16:43:37 <strcat[m]> button -> global duress password, rather than reusing the existing lockscreen UI
16:44:24 <strcat[m]> would be so much easier to implement, easier to maintain, and far less invasive
16:44:25 <strcat[m]> in fact you do not need the OS involved to make that
16:44:26 <strcat[m]> you can do it as an app already
16:44:32 <strcat[m]> via a quick tile
16:44:45 <justchill[m]> Won't that functionality be replicated by just doing the power + volume factory reset?
16:45:04 <strcat[m]> I think the point is that they want it to be fast
16:45:04 <skagreek[m]> <bypassbobby[m] "Newpipe is so much better anyway"> Would be cool if newpipe had a way to notify when a new vid is uploaded or streamer goes live.

17:04:51 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> When will Pixel 3XL be supported until?
17:06:01 <strcat[m]> it will be officially supported until it's end-of-life
17:06:08 <strcat[m]> you can look up the minimum guaranteed date for support
17:07:10 <strcat[m]> it's not known when the actual date will be, just the minimum, so we can't answer with specifics
17:07:10 <CrowmacMcCarthy[> Okay, roughly end of this year then
17:07:14 <strcat[m]> you can see that despite being an insecure end-of-life device, we've still being doing updates for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, but that is not official GrapheneOS anymore
17:07:14 <strcat[m]> it's an extended support release and cannot meet the standards for official support
17:07:15 <strcat[m]> it isn't secure and is to help people migrate to 4a / 4a (5G) / 5
17:25:30 <troubled90> Hello, I have a brandnew unlocked pixel 4a and I'm attempting to install GrapheneOS on it. But I'm getting an error during the flashing process. Which follows:

17:26:30 <troubled90> Does anyone know the solution to this error?
17:28:51 <strcat[m]> troubled90: sounds like a broken USB cable

17:28:57 <strcat[m]> or OS USB support
17:29:12 <troubled90> I'm using the new usb-c cable that came with it
17:29:42 <troubled90> What's the fix for this?
17:29:43 <troubled90> "or OS USB support"
17:29:54 <troubled90> Also, the web installer doesn't work at all
17:30:07 <troubled90> I just get this error when I try:

17:30:28 <troubled90> Even though I opened OEM unlock and the bootloader is unlocked
17:33:53 <HowardR> The build webpage says the following. Does it not apply to Pixel 5, or is it possibly an oversight?

17:40:05 <jess> i pulled that kline
17:40:12 <jess> seems like an accident to me
17:40:42 <troubled62> Sorry, I'm new to IRC
17:42:03 <troubled62> Is there a way to get support? I'm getting a fastboot error on a brand new unlocked device and google isn't showing anything
17:42:58 <strcat[m]> troubled62: make sure to follow either https://grapheneos.org/install/web (recommended) or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
17:43:02 <strcat[m]> there are a fair number of solutions to problems there
17:43:12 <strcat[m]> you'll need to give more details on what you're doing and what's going wrong
17:43:24 <strcat[m]> try following the web installer from the top and see if that works for you
17:43:32 <strcat[m]> and then if you get stuck ask for help
17:43:34 <troubled62> Hi
17:43:34 <strcat[m]> that's my recommendation
17:43:36 <troubled62> I tried both
17:43:42 <troubled62> The web installer fails completely
17:43:59 <troubled62> I'm trying the cli and have arrived at the "./fastboot-all.sh" script
17:44:05 <troubled62> The error occurs during that phase.
17:44:18 <troubled62> I already attempted the "tmp" space solution present in the guide but to no avail.
17:44:27 <troubled62> Fastboots error is cryptic and not helpful either
17:44:42 <troubled62> Sending 'super' (4 KB)                             FAILED (Write to device failed (Protocol error))
17:44:57 <strcat[m]> troubled62: that's a USB connection issue
17:45:09 <strcat[m]> use the cable that ships with the device if you can
17:45:16 <troubled62> How do I fix it? This usb-c cable is the one that came with the device
17:45:23 <troubled62> Brand new right out of the box
17:45:26 <strcat[m]> try a different port
17:45:28 <strcat[m]> on computer
17:45:44 <strcat[m]> and also try restarting the bootloader interface on the device since it'll have pending stuff waiting now
17:46:17 <troubled62> my laptop only has one usb-c slot
17:46:34 <troubled62> I have rebooted the device
17:46:42 <troubled62> Back to the bootloader interface
17:47:50 <troubled62> Do I have to buy a Usb-c to usb-a converter to get this to work?

17:49:55 <M3manu31[m]> I failed here. Any solution to fix this (Pixel 5)
17:50:08 <troubled62> Also during the install, it says things like: archive does not contain 'dtbo.sig'
17:53:44 <strcat[m]> the USB-C cable works fine
17:53:59 <strcat[m]> it's the best cable to use, since it will work for sure
17:53:59 <strcat[m]> it's not the cable that's the issue
17:54:00 <entry1[m]> <M3manu31[m] "I failed here. Any solution to f"> Cable issue most likely.
17:54:19 <entry1[m]> I ran into the same thing prior on the same step (3/4)
17:54:26 <strcat[m]> troubled62: probably the USB port or OS is broken
17:54:37 <strcat[m]> troubled62: so due to that you may need a different cable to use a USB-A port if your USB-C port doesn't work
18:02:07 <Manouchehri> oops, the Pixel 3a XL I bought is locked by Sprint / T-Mobile it seems
18:02:21 <Manouchehri> I thought only Verizon locked the bootloader :.
18:07:08 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: you can probably get them to unlock it
18:07:11 <strcat[m]> er, Manouchehri
18:07:18 <strcat[m]>  * you can probably get them to unlock it
18:09:59 <Manouchehri> strcat[m]: hmm, seems to be tricky as a non-customer :(
18:10:18 <Manouchehri> I messaged them on Facebook and Twitter though
18:10:39 <strcat> Manouchehri: get someone that's a customer to do it for you
18:10:56 <strcat> *shrug*
18:11:01 <strcat> Manouchehri: unlike Verizon they can/will unlock it
18:11:11 <strcat> Manouchehri: you can probably just socially engineer them into doing it
18:12:49 <Manouchehri> eh not sure if I can find someone willing to help :P
18:13:08 <Manouchehri> I forgot carrier locked phones are still a thing in the USA.
18:18:35 <strcat[m]> Manouchehri: contact them on facebook
18:18:54 <Manouchehri> yep, ongoing chat already. Trying to get past the account requirement atm
18:20:12 <strcat> people do stuff like buying phone on contract
18:20:20 <strcat> then sell it...
18:20:22 <Manouchehri> "I appreciate you letting me know! Unfortunately without a T-Mobile account I will be unable to process your request. We are only able to unlock devices for the original device owner and must verify the T-Mobile account the device originally came from to submit the request. Review this page for our requirements https://t-mobile.com/support/devices/unlock-your-mobile-wireless-device."
18:20:26 <strcat[m]> I expect you can get them to do it
18:20:28 <strcat[m]> at least if the person who owned it did the whole contract
18:20:39 <strcat> Manouchehri: *shrug*
18:20:51 <strcat> matrix irc bridge really slow atm
18:20:54 <strcat> I said that way earlier
18:21:10 <Manouchehri> I bought the phone brand new from B&H :/
18:23:49 <strcat> Manouchehri: weird, what makes it a Sprint/T-Mobile phone then?
18:24:26 <Manouchehri> strcat: I mean B&H did say it was a Sprint/T-Mobile locked phone, but I didn't realize that included the bootloader lol.
18:24:29 <Manouchehri> https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1616582-REG/google_ga00817_us_pixel_3a_xl_64gb.html
18:25:57 <strcat[m]> Manouchehri: what does `getprop ro.carrier.cid` say
18:26:38 <strcat> er
18:26:47 <strcat> Manouchehri: `getprop ro.boot.cid`

18:27:31 <zzxx123> Tmobile has a 40 days rule for unlock
18:27:33 <Manouchehri> 00000000
18:27:37 <strcat> Manouchehri: should be able to unlock it
18:27:41 <strcat> Manouchehri: did you connect it to a network?
18:27:53 <Manouchehri> yeah wifi
18:28:08 <Manouchehri> and put a foreign (well local to me) SIM card in.
18:28:08 <strcat> Manouchehri: maybe try putting in a random SIM?
18:28:11 <strcat> *shrug*
18:28:46 <M3manu31[m]> Do I need a SIM card for installation?!
18:29:02 <strcat> no
18:29:41 <strcat> Manouchehri: the lock is basically just a UI thing so if you could get system access (i.e. but not updating it and then eventually exploiting a bug) you could unlock
18:29:52 <strcat> Manouchehri: don't really have any other suggestion
18:29:56 <strcat> other than t-mobile being convinced to do it
18:30:13 <M3manu31[m]> I still cannot install (always the same error like I posted with the two pictures)
18:30:28 <strcat> Manouchehri: you should make it clear to them that you're the original owner and show them the receipt maybe?
18:31:22 <strcat[m]> 3manu31: use cable that comes with the device with a computer with working USB
18:32:17 <M3manu31[m]> <strcat[m] "3manu31: use cable that comes wi"> original cable is used.
18:32:42 <Manouchehri> strcat: after using an exploit, got a command handy or script that I could use?
18:32:54 <M3manu31[m]> <M3manu31[m] "original cable is used. "> directly connected no hub no adapter
18:34:36 <strcat> Manouchehri: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/services/core/java/com/android/server/oemlock/OemLockService.java#128
18:34:39 <M3manu31[m]> <strcat[m] "3manu31: use cable that comes wi"> Why a cable issue? It is working until system 3/4.
18:34:40 <strcat> Manouchehri: it's this API
18:34:50 <strcat> Manouchehri: don't have a script or anything
18:35:23 <Manouchehri> do you know what the process name is that would be calling that API?
18:35:31 <strcat> Manouchehri: Settings
18:35:34 <strcat> should work
18:35:38 <Manouchehri> thinking I can just use frida to hook it after exploiting the phone
18:35:49 <strcat> Manouchehri: you should be able to actually just
18:35:53 <strcat> fake that the device isn't carrier locked
18:35:55 <strcat> for this API
18:35:58 <strcat> for Settings
18:36:01 <strcat> and toggle the toggle with Settings
18:36:05 <strcat> it's literally a UI limitation afaik
18:36:28 <strcat> it just disables the toggle, it's not some kind of real security feature
18:36:33 <Manouchehri> How can I make sure I block updates in the meantime? I have "Automatic system updates" disabled in the developer options atm
18:37:12 <strcat> Manouchehri: disable play services?
18:37:13 <strcat> *shrug*
18:37:29 <strcat> but I think it respects that toggle
18:38:13 <strcat> Manouchehri: the hw is literally the same, it's just set up to check if it's allowed to allow oem unlocking
18:38:21 <strcat> (certain models are)
18:38:33 <strcat> and then gray out the option
18:38:41 <strcat> (well, leave it disabled)
18:39:06 <strcat> you might have to call the API to set it oem unlocked or at least the one to disable carrier lock
18:39:26 <strcat> but I suspect faking the response from the carrier lock check works
18:40:57 <entry1[m]> <M3manu31[m] "Why a cable issue? It is working"> Try a different cable and try a different USB port. If your OS is fully updated, they are the only true variables. I think it is the cable because I ran into the same thing. Cables wear after time when you keep plugging them in and out, and just in general over time.
18:42:05 <strcat> many cables also don't work in the first place
18:42:08 <strcat> for USB-C
18:42:11 <strcat> lots of broken ones
18:42:27 <strcat> sometimes only broken when plugged in 1 way
18:43:17 <entry1[m]> Precisely ^
18:43:17 <entry1[m]> If you are getting that far into the process 3manu31  it is probably the cable
18:43:50 <Manouchehri> strcat: cool, I'll trust the toggle then. T-Mobile is very unwilling to do anything without an account, plus they want the device activated for 40 days.
18:45:35 <zzxx123> Gotta make some excuses
18:45:46 <zzxx123> Like you are out of the country
18:45:52 <Manouchehri> yeah I already said that
18:45:54 <Manouchehri> which is true
18:46:05 <Manouchehri> "Such a great question David! We actually do not ship overseas, so we wouldn't have a way to get you signed up with an account since we cannot ship a SIM card out to you. You would need the SIM card so that the device can be used on our network for a minimum of 40 days, so it is important to be able to receive that. If you are able too, we recommend reaching out to third party companies for assistance unlocking
18:46:05 <Manouchehri> the device or returning it to the website you purchased it from since we are unable to unlock it for you!"
18:46:10 <M3manu31[m]> <entry1[m] "Try a different cable and try a "> Again how can a cable be broken been the issue when the flash process started and stops in the middle of the installation. If the cable is broken the issue should at from the early beginning or do I misunderstand?
18:46:18 <zzxx123> Did you call them?
18:46:33 <zzxx123> They don’t care over text communications
18:46:55 <entry1[m]> <M3manu31[m] "Again how can a cable be broken "> Because it happened with me, as I state before on the same exact step. Just use a different cable
18:47:00 <Manouchehri> zzxx123: I can, but I kinda doubt it'd be different. I'm talking with four different reps atm
18:47:08 <Manouchehri> and all of them have had the same responses

18:48:08 <entry1[m]> 3manu31 the cable can work for charging, data transfer, but not work to flash. There are many parts to the USB cable that can fail
18:48:11 <zzxx123> Yeah it was used on their network

20:57:18 <strcat> HowardR: guessing it's related to zfs
20:57:41 <nscnt[m]> I do too
20:57:46 <nscnt[m]> It doesn't like NTFS as well afaik
21:06:48 <nscnt[m]> ... just to point out that there may well be a problem due to the file system
21:07:19 <HowardR> strcat[m] Does it like ext4? Or what does it like?
21:07:41 <nscnt[m]> HowardR: Yes, ext4 works

21:17:23 <asdasfzxf> Could anyone link me to factory image for the 4a?
21:17:43 <asdasfzxf> Can only find the OTA image
21:18:14 <strcat[m]> lovers6: suggest reading FAQ
21:19:03 <lovers6[m]> I need a module to spoof id's like device id masker and privacy lua
21:19:04 <skagreek[m]> It's on the same page, but you gotta scroll down. And make sure the left box shows Factory Images instead of OTA. https://developers.google.com/android/images
21:20:04 <strcat[m]> lovers6: nope, please read FAQ
21:22:01 <strcat[m]> lovers6: required reading before posting
21:23:08 <lovers6[m]> <strcat[m] "lovers6: required reading before"> What?
21:23:19 <lovers6[m]> Sorry
21:23:48 <strcat[m]> lovers6: the topic is well covered there
21:24:12 <strcat[m]> you're only going to make things worse through poorly informed decisions and misinformation from Reddit
21:24:49 <strcat[m]> it's well covered in the FAQ
21:24:52 <strcat[m]> you need to read that
21:25:09 <strcat[m]> you cannot address fingerprinting through making obscure changes, it doesn't make sense
21:25:43 <strcat[m]> you are only misleading yourself by using some very limited Kotlin library on GitHub as your view of how 'fingerprinting' works
21:25:46 <strcat[m]> please read the FAQ
21:26:02 <strcat[m]> multiple sections covering it in detail
21:26:19 <skagreek[m]> Interesting read on the FAQ. So is it true that if you log in only ONCE with your google account, it ties the device to your account (kinda forever)?
21:26:42 <strcat[m]> skagreek: unclear what you mean
21:26:47 <strcat[m]> unanswerable
21:26:55 <strcat[m]> but the closest thing to an answer is no
21:27:00 <sigma_g> hi, I've tried disabling javascript for "http://*" in Vanadium, the URL turns red when I type the ':' and then I cannot save. I had it work on a linux install of chromium.
21:27:01 <lovers6[m]> FAQ on website?
21:27:12 <strcat[m]> lovers6: https://grapheneos.org/faq
21:27:38 <skagreek[m]> I mean this from FAQ:  "Google's Factory Reset Protection ties devices to a Google account using a tiny, special region of persistent state not wiped by a factory reset."
21:27:38 <strcat[m]> sigma_g: works differently
21:27:44 <strcat[m]> sigma_g: doesn't really have a purpose because http can just be upgraded to a redirect to https
21:27:59 <strcat[m]> skagreek: does not say what you just said here
21:28:04 <strcat[m]> skagreek: answer to your question is no
21:28:15 <skagreek[m]> OK thank you.
21:28:31 <skagreek[m]> I did a fresh GOS install out of the box anyway. Was curious.
21:28:33 <sigma_g> strcat[m]: oh right. I first tried to disable http entirely but couldn't find how to.
21:28:53 <strcat[m]> nothing about that says it is permanent or ties the device to an account, rather the device remembers an account until that's overwritten
21:29:25 <skagreek[m]> Geez, 50 years of speaking English is making me question my reading skills HAHA  :)
21:29:29 <strcat[m]> sigma_g: it already blocks all mixed content, etc.
21:29:44 <strcat[m]> skagreek: that's not what it says at all
21:30:22 <strcat[m]> it's talking about it taking a token for the device to remember the account so that the device requires logging into it (the stock OS implements this, AOSP does not, GrapheneOS does not)
21:30:29 <skagreek[m]> I mean you are correct and I read it incorrectly.
21:30:32 <strcat[m]> it is not a permanent thing in any sense
21:30:35 <strcat[m]> it is a little region of data
21:30:43 <skagreek[m]> Understood, thank you.
21:30:48 <strcat[m]> which can be used for different approaches to factory reset protection
21:31:07 <strcat[m]> Play services approach is using that to store the account (when the owner has added one)
21:31:22 <skagreek[m]> I see. Interesting.
21:31:24 <strcat[m]> so that it can remember it was tied to an account after factory reset
21:31:34 <strcat[m]> if you remove the account in the stock OS, it clears that
21:31:36 <strcat[m]> nothing permanent about it
21:31:45 <strcat[m]> it's the standard, well known factory reset protection feature
21:31:50 <strcat[m]> it's an anti-theft feature on Android and iOS
21:31:51 <strcat[m]> works similarly on both
21:32:02 <strcat[m]> exists so that a thief cannot simply wipe device via recovery
21:32:10 <strcat[m]> and then have a blank slate
21:32:13 <strcat[m]> if it was tied to an account in the OS
21:32:19 <skagreek[m]> The few minutes I spend here is a WEALTH of knowledge. Can't thank you guys enough.
21:32:22 <sigma_g> Blocking mixed content will remove http connections from an https-obtained webpage, but will not prevent me from clicking a 'http://' link, right?
21:33:21 <strcat[m]> not part of AOSP / GrapheneOS
21:33:21 <strcat[m]> part of Play services
21:33:21 <strcat[m]> sigma_g: won't prevent you from clicking an http link
21:33:21 <strcat[m]> sigma_g: http is insecure, but https does not imply secure
21:33:21 <strcat[m]> or trustworthy
21:33:31 <strcat[m]> many sites have insecure servers, websites, backend services, or transport encryption itself
21:33:35 <sigma_g> definitely :)
21:33:40 <strcat[m]> browsers are moving away from marking https secure
21:33:53 <strcat[m]> to treating what appears to be proper https (but often isn't) as neutral
21:33:59 <strcat[m]> and only treating http as dangerous
21:34:07 <strcat[m]> Vanadium already marks http as dangerous
21:34:22 <strcat[m]> soon Chromium will too
21:34:28 <strcat[m]> and then they start on marking https neutral
21:34:35 <grayhatter> strcat[m]: https does prevent the most common attact that users will see though
21:34:39 <strcat[m]> no
21:34:41 <strcat[m]> it doesn't
21:34:42 <grayhatter> attack*
21:34:54 <grayhatter> it doesn't?
21:34:58 <grayhatter> what's the most common then?
21:35:49 <strcat[m]> you're not being very specific
21:35:52 <strcat[m]> but if you were I don't think what you're saying would make sense
21:36:25 <strcat[m]>  * but if you were I don't think what you're saying would make sense either
21:37:00 <grayhatter> You're correct, I should have been more specific. The most common risk the average person whould be subjected to, so a malicious free wifi connection.
21:39:06 <sigma_g> I'm still hoping that on dodgy hotel WiFi access points they don't have a certificate approved by the default authorities :(
21:40:34 <lovers6[m]> A stupid question that isn't that stupid actually. If I use the free trial of an app, if I uninstall and reinstall that app will it be able to recognize my phone? This is not because I am interested in the free trial, but this too is fingerprint
21:42:11 <sigma_g> and as you say, https doesn't mean secure, but http is dangerous so I'd prefer blocking it rather than marking it dangerous (I'm mainly surprised that with all that Google says about http needing to die, they haven't added an option to do it yourself)
21:44:36 <lovers6[m]> > you're not being very specific
21:44:36 <lovers6[m]> strcat:
21:45:38 <lovers6[m]> > A stupid question that isn't that stupid actually. If I use the free trial of an app, if I uninstall and reinstall that app will it be able to recognize my phone? This is not because I am interested in the free trial, but this too is fingerprint
21:45:38 <lovers6[m]> strcat:
21:45:58 <sigma_g> anyway, I first installed GrapheneOS a few days ago and I would like to thank the people who develop/maintain it :) Have a nice day
22:13:18 <ronald439> nigger
22:16:36 <Thatcher[m]> ^ not cool
22:16:53 <nscnt[m]> strcat
22:31:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Wtf
22:32:36 <strcat[m]> lovers6: please read the FAQ sections on it and don't get information from non-technical people on social media
22:33:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Btw these bridge messages are kind of hard to read in telegram
22:33:11 <strcat[m]> lovers6: you're just panicking over some super uninteresting library on GitHub which is 100% covered in our FAQ (which covers far more than that in those sections)
22:34:19 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: vast majority of web traffic is already https, and the same for other traffic (apps have to opt-in to having non-TLS connections available at all)
22:34:34 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: networks should not be trusted in general
22:34:57 <strcat[m]> some random internet cafe network isn't particularly less trustworthy than most other networks
22:35:41 <strcat[m]> don't know why you'd list that as a prominent / major threat to people
22:37:28 <strcat[m]> and you won't be able to use that random Wi-Fi access if you can't deal with the annoying captive portal stuff they use
23:02:36 <eyeoftiger[m]> so GOS can't be installed on Samsung Galaxy due to chipset and h/w ?
23:07:19 <ulmirdin[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
23:08:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> h/w ? Also the device needs to support fully verified boot with custom keys
23:10:44 <strcat> eyeoftiger[m]: doesn't support installing alternate OSes for production use
23:10:53 <strcat> doesn't support various hardware-based security features for them
23:11:00 <strcat> and doesn't have proper AOSP support
23:11:09 <strcat> recommend reading docs
23:11:26 <strcat> broad device support isn't a goal and we want to support hardware suited for running GrapheneOS ideally made by a hardware partner
23:13:01 <eyeoftiger[m]> strcat: GrapheneOS-Teleg  TY for the reply, so do the Pixel phones do not have location tracking built into the phone ? if the idea is to stop ghoo-gle to track your device, do the pixels meet that requirement ?
23:13:11 <dannyknoll3[m]> <strcat "and doesn't have proper AOSP sup"> Sad for a company of their stature
23:13:38 <dannyknoll3[m]> eyeoftiger: Yes. Please read GrapheneOS.org in its entirety.
23:14:12 <strcat> eyeoftiger[m]: please read the vast amount of past discussions and information on the topic
23:14:29 <strcat[m]> expected that you read before posting here
23:14:36 <eyeoftiger[m]> ok sure, TY
23:15:04 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400 that too, among many other things
23:15:13 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
23:16:02 <strcat[m]> also seems you're missing the point of GrapheneOS
23:16:07 <strcat[m]> so I suggest reading about it
23:17:35 <testing123testin> hello
23:17:48 <strcat[m]> it's explicitly a non-goal to support many devices, or to make arbitrary devices less bad
23:17:58 <strcat[m]> broad device support is counter to the purpose of the project
23:18:07 <eyeoftiger[m]> ok
23:18:11 <strcat[m]> every added device hurts work on what the project actually builds
23:18:38 <strcat[m]> we would more than happily support only 1 device per 2 years, built to run GrapheneOS
23:18:56 <strcat[m]>  * we would more than happily support only 1 new device per 2 years, built to run GrapheneOS
23:22:28 <testing123testin> uhhh hey guys so hm it seems like the touchscreen on my 4A has stopped working after the most recent update >_<
23:23:43 <strcat[m]> unlikely that it has anything to do with an update
23:24:01 <strcat[m]> the most recent release also isn't even in beta yet
23:24:36 <testing123testin> oh ;_; but I downloaded it
23:24:41 <testing123testin> it was there
23:24:43 <testing123testin> I think
23:24:46 <strcat> which release
23:24:52 <testing123testin> 03.02.10
23:25:09 <strcat> that isn't in beta yet
23:25:14 <strcat> that's what you downloaded?
23:25:30 <testing123testin> it seems like it yeah I thought it was out
23:25:45 <strcat> it's available but not via the 2 public release channels yet
23:26:33 <testing123testin> oh
23:26:47 <strcat> so are you talking about a previous update?
23:26:58 <strcat> testing123testin: it probably isn't related to an update
23:27:01 <strcat> have you tried rebooting?
23:27:09 <strcat> what exactly isn't working?
23:27:16 <strcat> it doesn't take touch input? it doesn't display anything at all?
23:27:23 <testing123testin> no I downloaded 03.02.10 haha yeah I rebooted ermmm I also have a sim card passcode
23:27:26 <testing123testin> it has no touch input
23:27:50 <strcat> 2021.03.02.10 isn't in beta yet
23:28:06 <testing123testin> okie
23:28:09 <strcat> so where are you saying you downloaded it?
23:28:55 <testing123testin> https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-ota_update-2021.03.02.10.zip
23:29:15 <strcat> yeah that's not publicly released as an update yet
23:29:18 <testing123testin> usually when there's an update I just type in the date thing at the end and sideload it ;_;
23:29:45 <testing123testin> ah shoot okay
23:30:01 <testing123testin> welp uhhh hm so I am guessing there's no way to roll back huh
23:30:12 <strcat> no way to roll back if it boots successfully
23:30:19 <strcat> it hasn't gone through internal testing yet
23:30:29 <strcat> it's quite possible something needs to be changed to finalize the release
23:30:48 <strcat> it's being worked on
23:30:50 <testing123testin> ah okay so just wait for the public release?
23:30:51 <testing123testin> sorry
23:30:53 <testing123testin> I am sorry
23:30:58 <strcat> don't need to be sorry
23:31:02 <strcat> it's just not ready yet
23:31:08 <strcat> hasn't been tested
23:31:28 <testing123testin> okie:(  i'll just wait then
23:31:46 <strcat> I need to do blueline and then I can look at 4a
23:32:05 <testing123testin> sure thing, thank you
23:34:11 <strcat[m]> testing123testin: in the future I recommend waiting until it's in beta
23:34:15 <strcat[m]> and using the download link from there
23:34:19 <strcat[m]> rather than making the url yourself
23:36:22 <testing123testin> absolutely, will do
23:37:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> testing123testin: Hopefully all's good later. There's a certain irony in being advised (in a security-focused OS room) that there's such a thing as updating too quickly :P
23:38:17 <strcat[m]> well the update isn't really publicly available
23:38:19 <strcat[m]> it's just not hidden
23:38:20 <testing123testin> it is my fault
23:38:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> Of course things need to be tested in reality, but I find it a little funny
23:38:25 <strcat[m]> they made the URL themselves
23:41:51 <strcat[m]>                                                                                                                                        it's more than just a typical monthly update
23:42:05 <strcat[m]>  * it's more than just a typical monthly update
23:59:47 <nullnode[m]> <strcat[m] "they made the URL themselves"> 1337 update speed, bleeding tier left in the dust
