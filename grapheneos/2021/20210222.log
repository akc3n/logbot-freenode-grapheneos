00:02:18 <skagreek[m]> <b1101 "skagreek: I mean they're always "> I'm with you buddy. It's bugged me for years 😀
00:12:01 <SoftoLibre> Hi all, I just had a question about Verizon support. I've seen mixed things online about using Graphene with Verizon. Some folks say it works great, but then I saw something on github that said Graphene won't be adding a "carrier config" for Verizon? Could anyone help to clarify this?
00:12:14 <SoftoLibre> link to the relevant Github thread: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/153#issuecomment-734263067
00:37:13 <strcat[m]> SoftoLibre: it works, fancy features do not
00:37:21 <strcat[m]> SoftoLibre: use T-Mobile if you want a fully working carrier with GrapheneOS
00:37:40 <SoftoLibre> unfortunately not an option due to work, otherwise I would switch carriers :(
00:37:44 <SoftoLibre> Which features, do you know?
00:37:51 <SoftoLibre> Thanks for replying, btw
00:38:30 <rny> strcat[m]: do you know how to send files over NFC?
00:38:45 <rny> the intent doesnt fire
00:38:51 <rny> when i tap an NFC tag
00:39:32 <strcat[m]> rny: not a thing anymore via Android Beam
00:39:49 <strcat[m]> rny: it sucked, it was really slow/flaky
00:39:51 <strcat[m]> NFC is trash
00:40:20 <strcat[m]> was removed in Android 10 iirc
00:40:35 <strcat[m]> rny: it was basically just capable of sending something like a URL
00:40:45 <strcat[m]> sending a high res jpg would be a bit much for it
00:40:58 <rny> do we have android beam?
00:41:05 <strcat[m]> rny: no it's gone
00:41:09 <strcat[m]> removed in Android 10 upstream
00:41:09 <rny> i wanna get one of those epaper tablets that have an nfc tag above it
00:41:20 <strcat[m]> you can read nfc tags
00:41:21 <rny> how am i gonna send files to my epaper tablet?
00:41:34 <rny> **conveniently**
00:42:47 <SoftoLibre> strcat[m] Do you know if Verizon works with SMS/MMS/VoLTE?
00:43:29 <strcat[m]> SoftoLibre: should mostly work, VoLTE may not work
00:43:37 <strcat[m]> if you want VoLTE use a carrier that doesn't expect bloatware apps
00:43:48 <strcat[m]> we don't (and won't) include carrier bloatware
00:44:02 <SoftoLibre> I'm not defending verizon at all, I have no choice haha
00:44:08 <strcat[m]> why?
00:44:14 <SoftoLibre> Work plan
00:44:19 <strcat[m]> a Pixel from Verizon can't be unlocked anyway
00:44:31 <SoftoLibre> I would buy open market device and install verizon sim
00:44:37 <strcat[m]> SoftoLibre: it will mostly work fine
00:44:42 <strcat[m]> VoLTE unlikely
00:45:00 <SoftoLibre> The only thing I'm worried about is what happens when they shut down the CDMA network? Wasn't that supposed to happen at the end of this year?
00:46:46 <SoftoLibre> On my current device with LineageOS it runs on LTE only including voice, but receiving MMS doesn't work. Does the voice calling work because Lineage included bloatware of some kind?
00:46:56 <strcat[m]> rny: you can send files over Bluetooth
00:47:04 <strcat[m]> the NFC thing couldn't actually send anything substantial anyway
00:49:14 <strcat[m]> rny: Android Beam ended up just being used to pair Bluetooth in practice
00:49:19 <strcat[m]> rny: because NFC is trash
00:49:24 <skagreek[m]> Is it just me, or does Screen Cast not function properly?
00:49:43 <strcat[m]> skagreek: there isn't a Cast implementation bundled
00:49:53 <skagreek[m]> Got it, that explains it :)
00:49:56 <strcat[m]> if you're trying to use Chromecast use the VLC implementation
00:50:06 <skagreek[m]> OK will try. Thank you.
00:50:35 <skagreek[m]> Wanted to stream to the TCL televisions, so I'll have to figure out a way.
01:05:11 <SoftoLibre> strcat[m]: So voice calls will not work on Verizon at all when they shut down CDMA towers this year and move to LTE-only, correct? Sorry to be so persistent in my questioning, but I want to have as much info as possible before I pull the trigger on buying a new device
01:08:03 <m2tu[m]> Android 12 is comming :)=))))
01:13:09 <m2tu[m]> anyoen know which app is starting location services by default at every hard reset ?
01:23:22 <dnull> SoftoLibre: Most carriers are switching to VoLTE this year. So voice calls won't work unless your handset supports it.
01:25:28 <SoftoLibre> dnull: Dang, so Verizon GrapheneOS users will be screwed at that point. Okay, thank you for confirming! I suppose I could use Graphene for now and just move to another ROM when that happens.
01:26:20 <dnull> Afaik the Pixels all support VoLTE
01:26:24 <dnull> So no issue
01:30:29 <SoftoLibre> dnull: Okay, now I am very confused, because strcat was saying VoLTE will most likely not work with Verizon
01:33:51 <dnull> Hmm. Verizon calls it HD Voice and the network supports it. But strcat[m] would know the details better than I would.
01:35:15 <dnull> And there's this. https://community.verizon.com/t5/Verizon-Wireless-Services/Verizon-No-Longer-Supporting-4G-LTE-Capable-Phones/td-p/1075882
01:37:38 <SoftoLibre> He was saying that Verizon requires the inclusion of some kind of "bloatware" for VoLTE to work, but I'm running LineageOS on a Oneplus 6T right now, and VoLTE works on that device for Verizon (the Oneplus literally only works on LTE bands, and I can make voice calls without any Verizon application). So I'm not sure what the deal is
01:38:20 <dnull> Ah, that may be the case. Verizon has always been funky.
01:42:59 <SoftoLibre> They seem to be real bastards over at that company
01:43:26 <SoftoLibre> It's a nightmare to use anything on their network besides a locked down, spyware-ridden phone that you buy directly from them
01:44:37 <dnull> Yep. They've been that way since Ma Bell broke up.
01:46:07 <dnull> Back when they were Nynex

04:00:47 <morepheus_x[m]> Hi, I am just putting this out there again.  Is there a suggested method to get out of the fastboot mode if it's stuck.  I've tried several methods offered via youtube and yet my device isn't exiting the mode.   Previously, I tried to install GOS but it hasn't exited the fastboot mode.  So, I am considering reinstalling the Android OS, and then try to reinstall GOS via the web method instead of CLI method I tried
04:00:47 <morepheus_x[m]> earlier.
05:18:17 <carrotpie> I don't have another android compatible for attestation.  All my close people are iphone users Would it be best to skip the step or ask an acquaintance to do it?
05:18:57 <take_a_deep_brea> carrotpie:  attestation is a feature . it is entirely optional to undertake it .
05:20:48 <take_a_deep_brea> it can be very useful in situations where you expect your device to be compromised in some manner . not having your device attested does not cripple any of the device functionality . but i still recommend that you look around for some acquaintance with a modern android device and get it done
05:21:22 <take_a_deep_brea> also read https://attestation.app/about
05:21:28 <carrotpie> And to do this, I they will need to keep the app installed on their phones?
05:22:01 <take_a_deep_brea> carrotpie:  its upto you wether you want to regularly do it with another local device
05:22:07 <carrotpie> I am interested in remote attestation
05:22:39 <take_a_deep_brea> yes , that would be more viable in your case
05:22:46 <carrotpie> the attestation app needs to exist on the remote device after the initial scan to work?
05:23:09 <carrotpie> Example, you attest me and if you uninstall the app. I hav eno more attestation
05:23:35 <TheJollyRoger> morepheus_x[m]: I can't do a walkthrough for you at the moment, but I strongly suggest against using ANY type of unofficial guides unless you want a brick.
05:24:00 <TheJollyRoger> morepheus_x[m]: several YouTube guides (namely Techlore's) will result in a brick. Gamble with a $500 phone at your own risk.
05:25:05 <carrotpie> It might be a dumb question as it wouldn't make sense for the remote attestation to continue if the remote app is deleted
05:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> morepheus_x[m]: if fastboot is stuck, but is NOT transferring boot.img or any other payload, hit CTRL-C and wait. If after a minute CTRL-C has failed to stop it and it's hung, close the command window. Unplug your device, then plug it back in before doing anything else.
05:26:12 <TheJollyRoger> carrotpie: please read the documentation on attestation.app/about . It doesn't work the way you think it works.
05:28:20 <carrotpie> I did read it but I don't understand to be honest. I'll just hold off on it.
05:30:12 <TheJollyRoger> carrotpie: local verification is a one-time affair, with the capacity to do a more assured level of verification after the initial pairing. Integrity monitoring via AttestationServer involves a highly available webserver doing verification over the internet roughly every four hours and the AttestationServer contacting the user by a previously agreed-upon means should the phone fail to respond
05:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> to the AttestationServer's challenges.
05:31:52 <carrotpie> Your explanation clarifies it. Thank you. There is no harm in asking a stranger for the first attestation either?
05:31:58 <TheJollyRoger> In the event the phone be taken offline (powered off, disconnected from the internet, etc), or should the phone's system image be compromised, it will fail to check in and AttestationServer acts as something of a deadman's switch to send out the alert.
05:34:08 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't transmit anything personally identifiable. It can tell both you and your stranger if your device is running GrapheneOS, what your patch level is, if you have third-party device administrators or USB debugging enabled, whether or not you are using the owner account, and that your device has or has not been compromised.
05:34:27 <TheJollyRoger> *has or has not had its system image compromised
05:35:22 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah and it can also tell your stranger what device you are running.
05:35:28 <TheJollyRoger> but that's usually visible if you can see the device.
05:35:44 <TheJollyRoger> (ie: Pixel 4a, or 4a5G, etc)
05:36:02 <carrotpie> I'm an appreant noob. If I wanted to dive in or gain the tachnical knowledge to contribute to projects like this and other FOSS projects,  where do  I start?
05:36:18 <TheJollyRoger> carrotpie: you've come to the right place, shipmate!
05:36:57 <TheJollyRoger> Daniel Micay's tends to follow other security experts or developers on Twitter, which is publicly available.
05:37:03 <TheJollyRoger> You can find it at https://twitter.com/DanielMicay
05:37:44 <carrotpie> you're saying read and then start someonewhere?
05:38:38 <TheJollyRoger> if you're looking for 'dead tree' sources, I can try digging some up for you later, although it's pretty late here at this moment and I must be off.
05:38:56 <TheJollyRoger> An unfortunate problem with 'dead tree' sources tends to be they go obsolete pretty quick.
05:39:29 <carrotpie> Ill google dead tree sources. Thaks
05:39:33 <TheJollyRoger> Well,
05:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> what I mean by "dead tree sources' means "published books."
05:39:50 <TheJollyRoger> ie: dead trees = paper
05:39:53 <carrotpie> lol
05:40:08 <louipx> i thought you meant the spirit of the forest
05:40:31 <TheJollyRoger> Daniel Micay follows a large number of security-focused developers and experts, generally many of them publish thoughts and musings on security or code and practices, but I have to step away from the computer at the moment.
05:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> louipx: hahahaha now that would be funny.
05:41:12 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try to get back to you tomorrow. G'night!
05:43:11 <take_a_deep_brea> carrotpie:  Daniel Micay follows and is mutually followed by a lot of experts in computer security . many of them are pretty cool beyond the stuff they do with computers !

09:02:55 <manj-gnome> I have a question about installing GrapheneOS vie WebUSB. The instructions say that Arch Linux is officially supported for it. Is there any reason why it would not work on the Arch based Linux distribution Manjaro?
09:17:52 <damienrg[m]> <manj-gnome "I have a question about installi"> No. I believe that someone involved in GrapheneOS uses Arch Linux.
09:19:27 <take_a_deep_brea> manj-gnome:  you  are welcome to try it on manjaro . and i am 99% sure it will work as intended . just that arch linus has been tested by the devs
09:24:20 <somenerd[m]> "Officially supported" just means that it's regularly tested
09:24:30 <somenerd[m]> and verified to be working with new releases
09:35:56 <al3xth3k1d[m]> In use Manjaro. Had no issues
09:36:07 <al3xth3k1d[m]> * I used Manjaro. Had no issues
09:39:47 <Bootload> Hi, anyone here that can help me out a bit? Im trying to install Graphene on my fresh Pixel 4A. Developer etc enabled and OEM unlocked. When I boot with power+volumedown it enters in pretty much the same screen as in this screenshot: https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/aZhZxvUEutUNqhdpttWhEkWO/jj.jpg - The only difference is
09:39:48 <Bootload> that my device state is "locked".
09:39:48 <Bootload> When I try to proceed with the "unlocking the bootloader" step in the setup guide, i get a "Error: The device must be opened first." error.
09:39:57 <Bootload> Does anyone know whats up and/or how to resolve this?
09:46:11 <strcat[m]> Bootload: you're following https://grapheneos.org/install/web right?
09:47:30 <Bootload> Yes
09:48:04 <Bootload> Im indeed following that. From Ubuntu, using the USB cable which I got with/in the box of the Pixel
09:49:51 <Bootload> Chromium browser btw.
09:53:30 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Is it a Verizon device?/
09:53:34 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Aren't those hard locked
09:53:49 <Bootload> Im in the Netherlands, we dont have verizon or anything like that here.
09:54:44 <al3xth3k1d[m]> What happens if you skip to the install section the error above?/
09:54:46 <Bootload> its simlock free btw
09:54:52 <al3xth3k1d[m]> * What happens if you skip to the install section the error above?
09:55:02 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Simlock shouldn't matter
09:55:27 <Bootload> You mean what happens if i skip the "Unlocking the bootloader" and go directly to the next step, "Obtaining factory images" ?
09:55:34 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Yeah.
09:55:41 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Seems as its already showing as unlocked
09:55:53 <Bootload> Let me check!
09:56:00 <al3xth3k1d[m]> In not a dev BTW.  Just a user.
09:56:19 <al3xth3k1d[m]> You're not gonna kill it.  Worst case scenario just restore it with Android Flash Tool to stock and go again
09:56:56 <Bootload> Alright. Ill have a look at it.
09:57:17 <Bootload> Same error "Error: The device must be opened first."
09:57:28 <Bootload> Device state is also still locked, not sure why that is..
09:59:59 <al3xth3k1d[m]> If you have the ability.  I would try doing it manually on a Linux box.
10:00:00 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Lock it. Then re unlock it maybe
10:00:01 <al3xth3k1d[m]> Weird
10:05:39 <Bootload> THanks for the advice. If anyone else has other input that would be greatly appreciated!
10:07:31 <TheLoneWanderer[> You did do flashing unlock, right?
10:07:52 <TheLoneWanderer[> fastboot flashing unlock
10:08:27 <Bootload> I thought I did but im indeed goiung through that process again atm. Will let you know if it did or didnt fix anything.
10:09:30 <TheLoneWanderer[> Did it tell you that all data was going to be erased?
10:09:56 <Bootload> Yeah, thats no issue. Its a fresh phone.
10:10:03 <Bootload> Thanks for the heads up though.
10:10:49 <TheLoneWanderer[> I didn't exactly mean it like that
10:11:14 <TheLoneWanderer[> If you unlock the bootloader, it tells you to confirm and erases all data
10:11:27 <Bootload> Ohh
10:11:30 <TheLoneWanderer[> Just asking in case you missed that step
10:11:47 <Bootload> No it did not, I think I missed a step somewhere at that point.
10:12:00 <TheLoneWanderer[> All good
10:12:03 <Bootload> Doing CLI install now, that gives me a bit more control of the process and I can follow how it goes.
10:12:04 <TheLoneWanderer[> You missed the
10:12:12 <TheLoneWanderer[> fastboot flashing unlock
10:12:43 <Bootload> I think so yeah. Thanks for confirming that! Im going to do another try right now and im pretty optimistic that will fix it haha
10:13:52 <TheLoneWanderer[> <TempHlp001 "TheLoneWanderer: Still getting t"> Did you manage to fix it?
10:14:15 <TempHlp001> Nope. Still not sure what's going on.

10:19:02 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: immediately stop following any third party guides, they are dangerous
10:19:03 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: forget what you have been told to do by third party guides
10:19:03 <strcat[m]> you are going to brick the device
10:19:30 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: either use the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web (recommended) or the official CLI guide at https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
10:19:34 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: help cannot be provided for third party guides here
10:20:06 <strcat[m]> our CLI guide works, and it's safe if you follow the instructions correctly
10:20:10 <strcat[m]> the web installer is easier and safer
10:20:58 <TheLoneWanderer[> unrelated but is the web installer still ok if the connection is unstable?
10:21:22 <strcat[m]> yes
10:21:45 <strcat[m]> doesn't depend any more on a stable connection than the CLI install
10:21:56 <strcat[m]> if you successfully loaded the page you have the whole web installer
10:22:09 <TempHlp001> Online installer would not recognize device... Tips for getting it to recognize?
10:22:21 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: the guide explains that
10:22:26 <TheLoneWanderer[> Are you using a chromium browser?
10:22:30 <TempHlp001> Yes
10:22:31 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: you'll have the same issue with CLI install
10:22:41 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: start at the beginning of the guide
10:22:44 <strcat[m]> don't skip anything
10:23:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#booting-into-the-bootloader-interface
10:23:05 <strcat[m]> these steps are important
10:23:12 <strcat[m]> you have to make sure to do it as it says, in the correct order
10:23:15 <strcat[m]> no deviation from it
10:23:42 <TempHlp001> Not installing Win 10 so I guess I'm SOL then?
10:23:42 <strcat[m]> if you haven't done these steps including with Windows Update (at the correct time) then you aren't at the point where you unlock yet
10:24:03 <strcat[m]> you're not on an OS that's officially supported before either the web install or CLI install
10:24:06 <strcat[m]> in all likelihood it will still work
10:24:13 <strcat[m]> using a third party guide is just going to brick your device though
10:24:22 <strcat[m]> and perhaps screw up your install
10:24:31 <strcat[m]> you might have already done that if you used that 'minimal fastboot'
10:24:39 <strcat[m]> which is broken third party software
10:24:56 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: since you were following a third party guide you're going to have to repair whatever issues that caused 1st
10:25:08 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: it would be easier to do this fresh on a different computer
10:26:01 <TempHlp001> Don't think the install is screwed up. Still have original OS running.
10:27:13 <TempHlp001> I don't have another computer to do this from. Can you point out the specifics on what needs to be removed to return to a normal state?
10:29:12 <TempHlp001> FWIW, I started following a 3rd party guide when the official install instructions did not work.
10:29:40 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: you were missing steps, in all likelihood
10:29:48 <strcat[m]> did you use Windows Update in the way it says at the point it says?
10:30:13 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: do you have a phone you can use to perform the installation?
10:30:21 <strcat[m]> a 2nd phone
10:30:22 <strcat[m]> with USB-C
10:32:15 <TempHlp001> Computer is only option.
10:32:57 <psychologicaldam> <TempHlp001 "Computer is only option."> Windows or Linux?
10:33:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> TempHlp001: ok
10:33:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can you pm me
10:33:30 <TempHlp001> Win 7. I am able to make connection/control the phone through command prompt. Only error is when I get to the .\flas-all.bat command.
10:33:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> TempHlp001: what's the error
10:34:09 <TempHlp001> fastboot too old
10:34:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> TempHlp001: pm
10:36:02 <TempHlp001> Temp account. Saying I can't send PMs.
10:39:40 <strcat[m]>  TempHlp001 you need to follow https://grapheneos.org/install/web or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
10:39:49 <strcat[m]> it's off-topic if you're following an unofficial guide
10:40:00 <strcat[m]> so, clean up all that stuff, uninstall whatever they told you to install
10:40:05 <strcat[m]> and start over
10:40:10 <strcat[m]> and if you get stuck, ask for help with that
10:40:39 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: sounds like you were missing the Windows Update step in the web install guide (at least at the appropriate time)
10:40:55 <strcat[m]> don't know what you've done from outside of the official guides now, pretty hard to offer help due to that now
10:41:47 <TempHlp001> I tried using the minimal_adb_fastboot_1.4.3_portable
10:43:53 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: yeah, that is unsafe third party software
10:44:00 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: you need to remove it all
10:44:12 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: if you installed something, you need to remove it
10:44:18 <strcat[m]> it's now going to be significantly harder to install
10:44:30 <strcat[m]> I think all you were missing is going into Windows Update at the appropriate time and getting the driver through it
10:44:37 <strcat[m]> now it is going to be harder
10:45:01 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: need to remove a broken driver if you got one installed via that 'minimal fastboot' third party software
10:45:04 <TempHlp001> I didn't install anything just unzipped into a directory and ran commands.
10:45:15 <strcat[m]> afaik it installs a driver
10:45:33 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: as a first step, remove all of that, and reboot
10:45:46 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: start with the web install guide again, make sure to do the Windows Update step
10:46:10 <strcat[m]> important to reboot to get anything that's running based on that to stop
10:46:23 <TempHlp001> I installed the official android driver from the android site: usb_driver_r13-windows Is that what you mean?
10:47:38 <strcat[m]> no, it's not what I mean
10:47:40 <strcat[m]> but that should be fine
10:47:44 <strcat[m]> it's not what we say to do though
10:47:53 <strcat[m]> you can't really expect the guide to work if you're not following it
10:48:20 <strcat[m]> it's off-topic if you're doing anything but following one of the 2 official install methods
10:50:19 <TempHlp001> I'm going to regroup on this and try again at a later date.
10:51:29 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: the web install will probably work fine if you installed that official driver
10:51:32 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: unless cable / USB port is broken
10:52:03 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: the reason what you were doing via CLI is not working is because we added a safety check to the flashing script which prevents using an out-of-date / broken fastboot which bricks devices
10:52:09 <TempHlp001> Like I said, I have been able to connect to the phone and control it through command prompt. Drivers working fine.
10:52:21 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: if you follow the official CLI it will work
10:52:28 <strcat[m]> clear away all the stuff you downloaded/extracted
10:52:31 <strcat[m]> start over with the official one
10:52:40 <strcat[m]> you're not supposed to dl / extract anything via browser / file explorer
10:52:48 <strcat[m]> TempHlp001: web install should work too tho
10:52:51 <strcat[m]> will be easier
10:52:52 <TempHlp001> Yep, it is already gone.
11:04:52 <Bootload> Thanks for the help guys/gals, I got it working!
11:05:13 <Bootload> Was indeed a missed step with the Fastboot..
11:09:27 <Bootload> Is there a quickstart guide available somewhere for Grapheneos btw?
11:13:58 <rny> Bootload: its just like android
11:14:11 <rny> read the website for the extra features
11:16:49 <Bootload> Will do, thanks all!
11:35:21 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is there any reason fdroid isn't preinstalled? Might make it easier for beginners. Just a thought.
11:37:12 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
11:37:37 <somenerd[m]> F-droid also has quite a few problems that lead it to not be considered to be included
11:37:53 <somenerd[m]> ex: old apps
11:44:31 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Yeah, it says that users should get their apps from fdroid.

11:45:06 <somenerd[m]> believe that F-droid had robustness issues, let me check the issue tracker

11:54:57 <sonic_the_hedgeh> After building an signing my own version of GrapheneOS as per the build instructions I am stuck in a bootloop. "flash-all" back to the original GrapheneOS version works without problems. The flashing output for both versions look very much alike.
11:54:57 <sonic_the_hedgeh> I did compile the kernel and did also some smaller changes to android like including additional packages.
11:54:57 <sonic_the_hedgeh> Is there any way to debug the initial boot / bootloop to get to the bottom of the problem?
12:00:05 <eyeoftiger[m]> Hello all - I've been thinking of getting away from being a product to big tech, I know it is not 100% avoidable. But am thinking of getting a Pixel 5 and installing the stable version of GOS,
12:03:18 <alex-resist> Pixel 3a XL on stable: GrapheneOS updater fails to detect the availability of a new update when Orbot is in VPN-mode. This has happened before. Once Orbot is deactivated, the update process starts immediately. This is in contrast to the information on the website, where it says "The update protocol doesn't send identifiable information to the update server and works well over a VPN / Tor".
12:24:20 <alex-resist> I'm creating an issue, it's about time I start doing this :)
13:12:58 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: entirely possible certain exit nodes block connections to our update server and/or connectivity check server

16:28:45 <eyeoftiger[m]> ok so for GOS, where do we get the apps
16:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> eyeoftiger[m]: That's up to you. One place to get them is from the Aurora Store, which provides a mirror of what's available on Google Play and permits you to browse it anonymously.
16:30:31 <take_a_deep_brea> eyeoftiger:  consider joining #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  for discussion about apps . for getting more apps you could use fdrodi or aurora store

16:37:14 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to sideload them and whitelist them by giving them permission to install other apps. GrapheneOS does not permit unattended installs, so each time an app is updated, the OS will warn you in the foreground.
16:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> It's a minor annoyance but it's an interim measure until GrapheneOS has its own application store of curated apps chosen for security.

16:55:01 <skagreek[m]> Can't trust ANYTHING these days, Apple or Google. We don't know what's happening in the background.
16:56:00 <eyeoftiger[m]> @brenneke ya true, I wish there was a way to nuke google play services or google services, but can't do that in stock os. and I wish GOS was supported/certified on some phones other than pixel, S20 or S21 are nice phones
17:02:33 <skagreek[m]> eyeoftiger: I wonder how many total guys there are working on Graphene. Probably hard to port to other phones if only a few programmers. Even all this seems like pretty hard work for a few people.
17:04:41 <eyeoftiger[m]> skagreek:  ya sure, I read a bit about GOS and it is brain child of one person, surely others are contributing but what happens when a small team have other things and throw in the towel,
17:04:54 <eyeoftiger[m]> that is 1 point/risk that came to mind
17:05:16 <take_a_deep_brea> skagreek:  yes . its important that the supported devices are supported well
17:06:13 <eyeoftiger[m]> I feel like taking a risk of trying to install GOS  on S20
17:07:27 <take_a_deep_brea> eyeoftiger:  even a risk has a finite probability of succeding

17:09:25 <take_a_deep_brea> no it does not make any sense
17:09:26 <take_a_deep_brea> to do that
17:09:26 <eyeoftiger[m]> and if GOS does not get installed successfully, should I be able to install stock rom ?
17:09:56 <eyeoftiger[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "to do that"> ok will not, might stay with stock rom
17:10:11 <take_a_deep_brea> eyeoftiger:  dont play with samsung devices . take my word for it .

17:11:33 <rhinobaer666[m]> a friend of mine is getting pixel 4a and I'm eager to install GOS for him on that phone. I have expereince with other phones, custom mods rooting n stuff. The documentation on the website seems so well written. I just wanted to ask, is the WebUSB Installer method really that easy and stright forward, as it seems to be? It just seems to easy ...
17:11:51 <eyeoftiger[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "zero support from samsung "> ok got it
17:11:52 <damienrg[m]> <rhinobaer666[m] "a friend of mine is getting pixe"> Yes
17:11:56 <rhinobaer666[m]> :D
17:12:24 <take_a_deep_brea> absolutely .
17:12:28 <damienrg[m]> The biggest problem is to have the right USB cable / Port.
17:12:36 <rhinobaer666[m]> ok
17:12:48 <take_a_deep_brea> you could do it from another relatively new android device even .
17:12:49 <rhinobaer666[m]> original cable and direct port should do it?
17:13:07 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
17:13:22 <take_a_deep_brea> you can always come here for assistance if something goes wrong
17:13:36 <rhinobaer666[m]> the docu also says exactly that, that it is the most propable point of failure for most people
17:13:37 <damienrg[m]> <rhinobaer666[m] "original cable and direct port s"> In my case I did not work I had to bought a USB-A to USB-C cable.
17:14:05 <damienrg[m]> It was probably due to my USB port.
17:14:27 <rhinobaer666[m]> hm. yeah my desktop is pretty old
17:14:44 <rhinobaer666[m]> but my laptop is relatively new, so i just use that
17:15:39 <rhinobaer666[m]> the buttons on the webusb installer page will be clickable once i connect the device? stupid question prolly...
17:16:34 <damienrg[m]> Yes.
17:17:31 <damienrg[m]> Are you on GOS?
17:18:20 <take_a_deep_brea> rhinobaer666: just go through that page once . and only after reading it start the process . its very easy to miss something as many have before .
17:19:37 <rhinobaer666[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare:  yeah I already did. Will do it few times more before I start. so that I dont miss any step.
17:20:16 <rhinobaer666[m]> alright, thanks so long, kind hoomans. will try and hopefully succeed🙂
17:22:51 <rhinobaer666[m]> <damienrg[m] "Are you on GOS?"> no
17:23:13 <rhinobaer666[m]> one more question, is it possible to brick the device if I'm stupid enough?
17:23:23 <rhinobaer666[m]> Whats the worst case scenario?
17:23:57 <zvl12[m]> <rhinobaer666[m] "Whats the worst case scenario?"> to loose your friend :)

17:26:33 <rhinobaer666[m]> wont be the same he wont want nothing other than pixel with gos. I still have crapsung
17:27:07 <rhinobaer666[m]> but seriously , do u see often cases of bricked devices, or is that rather hard to accomplish?
17:28:59 <skwisgaar[m]> rhinobaer666: if you follow an unofficial guide, then it is very possible to brick your device. If you’re careful and follow official instructions, should not be a problem.
17:29:29 <skwisgaar[m]> rhinobaer666: with the WebUSB installer specifically, I don’t think it’s possible to brick.

18:53:10 <Gamma> Im currently installing GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a 5g. Is it normal that I dont get any feedback for several minutes, after starting the flash script?
18:54:08 <strcat[m]> Gamma: no, means you likely missed a step
18:54:37 <strcat[m]> Gamma: make sure to use either the web installer https://grapheneos.org/install/web (recommended) or https://grapheneos.org/install/cli for CLI installation
18:55:03 <strcat[m]> the official methods cover everything needed such as udev rules on desktop Linux and installing the bootloader interface driver on Windows via Windows Update
19:04:03 <Bill[m]> Hi everyone, I've been bouncing back and forth between GrapheneOS and another one, and have pretty much settled on GOS now.  I installed and set-up everything yesterday, and noticed that there is an option to restore from back-up on initial boot up.  I keep trying to find documentation on the backup process / procedure - but have not had any luck on the FAQ's.  I am sure I am just missing it, anyone have details ?
19:05:56 <nscnt[m]> Bill: GrapheneOS uses Seedvault[1] for backups. [1]: https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault
19:06:37 <chris42> @strcat Just tried the webinstall for a Pixel 5 on a Linux Mint using Chrome. It completly froze my laptop. Let it run for about 1 1/2h however it did not recover
19:06:48 <Bill[m]> Excellent - appreciate the reply
19:06:55 <chris42> Flashed via command line and that worked well
19:07:14 <strcat[m]> chris42: and it's locked + all works fine now?
19:08:13 <chris42> Yes, locked and I am just playing around with it. The Webinstaller seemed to completly eat up RAM, hence stopping everything on my laptop to happen

19:28:38 <timeo[m]> Im not sure if this is the right place to recommand security feature
19:34:43 <timeo[m]> But what about a option that will erased the device after 5 failed unlock attempts
19:35:46 <timeo[m]> But you can change the amount of times with unlock attemtps
19:36:18 <TheJollyRoger> timeo[m]: Device wipe on failed authentication is obsolete.
19:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> The reason it was done in the past with older phones was because older phones didn't have a separate secure element.
19:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> Because the security chip for which key derivation depends on has its own internal timer which does not answer to the host clock, it can enforce progressively lengthening timeouts between attempts, and will enforce a timeout of 24 hours between attempts after 150 failed attempts; to brute force a simple 4-digit pincode and try all available pins would take over six hundred years.
19:38:16 <TheJollyRoger> That's only a relatively weak 4-digit pincode.
19:39:08 <Gamma> Everything worked out. The OS is successfully installed and verified. Thank you all very much.
19:39:29 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS allows you to use 64-character passphrases if you should so desire to extend this into computational infeasibility. There is a more detailed writeup on how the filesystem encryption system on GrapheneOS works on the FAQ at https://grapheneos.org/faq . It's very elegant and can deter brute-force pincode attacks without you needing to keep your data in a perpetually precarious
19:39:31 <TheJollyRoger> situation where it could be lost at any time.
19:39:39 <TheJollyRoger> Gamma: glad to hear it's working for you! Welcome aboard the ship!
19:42:52 <timeo[m]> Thanks, for the infomation i didn't know about this
19:43:05 <timeo[m]> * Thanks, for the infomation i didn't know about that.
19:44:55 <TheJollyRoger> timeo[m]: no problem! It's a question we often get asked.
19:45:42 <TheJollyRoger> Often a lot of the security measures in GrapheneOS (and also, the improvements the factory Google Android) are designed to function transparently, without putting on a show for you or getting in the way. So a lot of people often don't realize that they're there.
19:46:25 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't a bad thing; it just means sometimes a number of them can be hard to see them from time to time, and then when they become hard to see, it becomes difficult to trust they are working.
19:48:34 <TheJollyRoger> But if you'd like to see and you have some time to experiment, power off your Pixel, then turn it back on and try entering the wrong password about 50 times in a row. You'll notice the phone will make you start waiting longer and longer once you get to around 50 incorrect tries. First it'll be five seconds, then ten, then twenty, then forty, until the maximum of one day is reached at 150 tries,
19:48:35 <TheJollyRoger> which would take you roughly two months of waiting.
19:49:17 <TheJollyRoger> This measure is meant to bolster the strength of a short pincode. While it can't save you if your pincode is your birthday or your school graduation year or something easily guessable, it can *definitely* save you from a brute force attack.
19:54:05 <spamx101[m]> Wait, you're saying one can "experiment" - trying this ourselves wouldn't, well, lock us out of our phones for a month? Haha, or you were just suggesting to try out on an extra phone, etc.?
19:54:48 <TheJollyRoger> spamx101[m]: it won't, at 50 tries, it may make you wait about a minute until you can unlock your phone again, and it could take you about thirty minutes or so to complete the experiment.
19:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if you want to try to go for 150 attempts that it reaches the rate of 1 attempt per 24 hours.

20:21:35 <strcat[m]> newthis: yes but not from GrapheneOS as a project
20:21:42 <strcat[m]> newthis: https://grapheneos.org/install/web is quite accessible though
20:21:56 <snooopy> webinstall <3
20:22:22 <strcat[m]> newthis: there's a web-based installer usable from a browser, no additional software required
20:22:36 <strcat[m]> on Windows you may need to install an optional update that appears in Windows Update with a necessary driver but that's covered
20:33:54 <Thatcher[m]> newthis Installing Graphene yourself is very rewarding. If you have doubts, I have a few new Pixel 4a's I have already flashed with Graphene that I've tried to sell to friends/family to no avail. They're up for the same price I got them for, which is $349 + California tax
20:34:32 <Thatcher[m]> ^ Off topic, but I hope doesn't break any rules

20:48:36 <Thatcher[m]> * I even made little Graphene stickers for the boxes (not the phone) using an Avery template kit
20:51:17 <newthis[m]> Thats cool. I was hoping someone would know. I wad wondering if it was legal to buy these since GrapheneOS is trademarked. I'm surprised they are not selling them. Some people are not able to  do this install.
20:57:10 <Thatcher[m]> They're hard to sell and not much profit to the seller since one wants to pay hefty markup on a budget phone that has Graphene pre-installed.
20:57:50 <Thatcher[m]> Also, most people don't (and shouldnt) trust a third party selling phones with Graphene
20:58:03 <Thatcher[m]> Unless it's Daniel himself
20:59:09 <Thatcher[m]> The legality of it though, I don't think Daniel has a problem with people selling pre-flashed Graphene phones, but I may be sorely mistaken!
21:00:48 <Thatcher[m]> In my case however, I only have 4 extra 4a's being sold at what I got them for because I'm doing this because it's fun to flash Graphene and sell stuff online.
21:01:57 <Thatcher[m]> Probably won't buy or sell anymore unless someone really doubts their ability to flash it themself
21:02:54 <Thatcher[m]> * Unless it was to be Daniel himself
21:05:03 <Thatcher[m]> That's all I will say. This is off topic. Any inquiries, PM me! 😁
21:05:26 <newthis[m]> Thatcher Nice. I am looking at the pixel 5. I will keep this in mind though.
21:22:09 <SimplyCorbett99> I'm having issues on the pixel 4 xl with the latest grapheneos. SMS and email notifications don't appear. When I log into my phone they instantly show up, some received upwards of 40 minutes ago.
21:23:30 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: it's perfectly legally as long as the sellers don't present themselves as official
21:23:35 <strcat[m]>  * Thatcher: it's perfectly legal as long as the sellers don't present themselves as official
21:24:08 <strcat[m]> don't mind either, fine with 2000 people selling GrapheneOS phones, we'll keep making the installation and out-of-the-box experience better though
21:24:21 <strcat[m]> and eventually we'll have hardware partners instead of using Pixels
21:27:08 <SimplyCorbett99> It looks like issue #121 is what I'm dealing with but that was closed back in 2019.

22:05:25 <TempHlp001> Hi, still having trouble installing. Tried following the official posted guides: webinstall and cli. Webinstall will not recognize device in Chrome (Pixel 3a). Cannot flash OS to device using cli due to a "fastboot too old" error. Using fastboot v30.0.5 but also same error with v31.0.0. Device is unlocked and has communication with computer
22:05:25 <TempHlp001> (current android usb drivers installed). I'm on a Win7 SP1 machine with all current updates installed and PowerShell v7.1. Any ideas?
22:22:37 <Publius> TempH: It sounds to me like you do not have correct drivers installed/enabled
22:23:01 <Publius> You need the "ADB Debugging Interface" driver to communicate with your device when it is in fastboot mode
22:27:55 <timeo[m]> <TempHlp001 "Hi, still having trouble install"> For me i got the same issue with "fastboot too old"
22:28:17 <TempHlp001> How would I verify the driver is working properly? Running the command .\adb devices shows my device listed.
22:28:56 <TempHlp001> timeo, did you ever find a solution?
22:29:08 <timeo[m]> Look in device manager
22:29:46 <timeo[m]> And see if there is a connect there
22:30:09 <Publius> ^yes, and see what how your PC recognizes the device. It should be a "ADB Debugging Interface"
22:30:33 <Publius> ...but should still call it a "Pixel 3a"
22:31:34 <Publius> With device in fastbood mode, from command prompt, type "fastboot devices", and device should reply immediately with its serial number - that is, if your drivers are configured properly
22:33:48 <TempHlp001> "fastboot devices" in cmd shows the device
22:34:11 <TempHlp001> I don't see "Pixel 3a" listed in device manager though.
22:34:47 <TempHlp001> There is an "Android Bootloader Interface" in device manager
22:36:25 <TempHlp001> I did see the Pixel 3a listed in DM when I upgraded drivers yesterday. Just not currently when in fastboot mode.
22:37:49 <Publius> I had issues getting my driver situation squared away. I seem to recall one of the wrong ones was "Android Bootloader Interface". On Windows 10, the correct one is definitely "ADB debugging interface".
22:43:47 <timeo[m]> <TempHlp001 "I did see the Pixel 3a listed in"> When connecting your phone to your pc  look in devicee manager at "portable devices" or "ports"
22:44:17 <timeo[m]> And see if there a new connect there
22:46:02 <timeo[m]> * And see if there a new connect there  (I don't have windows right now so I can't)
22:46:11 <TempHlp001> Not seeing Pixel 3a listed under those sections. There is an Android Composite ADB Interface listed now when booting device into the regular OS.
22:46:18 <timeo[m]> * And see if there a new connect there  (I don't have windows right now so I can't check)
22:47:13 <timeo[m]> It might be a random name as well
22:49:37 <TempHlp001> It is definitely the Android Composite ADB Interface. When cycling the usb cable it goes away and comes back.
22:50:08 <Publius> I think proper driver when device is booted and running on OS should be "MTP USB Device"
22:51:17 <TempHlp001> Don't see that one.
22:53:39 <timeo[m]> <TempHlp001 "Don't see that one.">  can you transfer files from your phone in default rim?
22:53:54 <timeo[m]> *  can you transfer files from your phone in default rom?
22:56:23 <timeo[m]> So i know that the usb port is not broke
22:56:46 <TempHlp001> Ok, when turning off "USB debugging mode" in the device, it shows up in DM as Pixel 3a. When debugging mode is on it shows up under the other device name.
22:58:49 <TempHlp001> In fastboot mode it is labeled as "Android Bootloader Interface" in DM. In usb debugging mode it is listed as "Android Composite ADB Interface"
23:01:43 <TempHlp001> I don't see any files when opening the device.
23:01:59 <TempHlp001> Opening in windows explorer that is.
23:03:16 <mynacol[m]> TempHlp001: You need to pull down to get to the notifications and select device connected or sth. Then you can select MTP/file transfer
23:06:51 <coppermain[m]> why not try out CopperheadOS, there we will help you with live support.
23:07:13 <Publius> Copperhead sucks donkey ballz
23:07:43 <Publius> Actually, it's not even good enough to suck donkey ballz
23:07:55 <coppermain[m]> someone is being rude, just ignore him.
23:08:11 <TempHlp001> Ok, can see files on the device in win explorer now. Transfers work fine.
23:08:16 <coppermain[m]> just join our group for better support
23:08:19 <Publius> Rude, is the thievery of intellectual property that Copperhead is guilty of
23:08:27 <fast1[m]> Does the system updater use the owner's VPN? If I want to always download updates over Tor is it enough to just enable a Tor VPN on the owner account?
23:08:35 <coppermain[m]> <Publius "Rude, is the thievery of intelle"> got any proof of that?
23:08:48 <TempHlp001> Yeah, not interested in CH.
23:08:48 <Publius> Yep
23:08:56 <fast1[m]> While using profiles that aren't using a Tor VPN*
23:08:57 <Publius> Good luck in court, ass
23:09:01 <sphinx[m]> dazinism: Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when? louipcm
23:09:07 <coppermain[m]> TempHlp001: just ignore those freaks
23:09:40 <Publius> translation: "pay no attention to fact I'm a shyster"
23:10:08 <coppermain[m]> they are just jealous of our work. nothing more than that
23:10:17 <Publius> LMFAO
23:10:36 <TempHlp001> Ignored. Can we get back to solving the problem?
23:10:50 <timeo[m]> <TempHlp001 "I don't see any files when openi"> How it is going so far?
23:10:54 <Publius> Sure. Bottom line here, is your drivers are not configured properly. Don't remember Windows7 and how you update drivers there, but you need:
23:11:18 <TempHlp001> I can see and transfer files from the device.
23:11:18 <Publius> MTP USB Device to transfer files between device and PC when device is booted and running on OS
23:11:39 <Publius> ADB Debugging Interface to perform the OS flash, when device is in fastboot mode
23:11:46 <coppermain[m]> <TempHlp001 "Ignored. Can we get back to solv"> careful of them, they make you install malware on your phone.
23:11:49 <Publius> Get those drivers installed and then proceed
23:12:16 <Publius> I know you're jealous, coppermain, but please keep your BS to yourself
23:12:50 <TempHlp001> Ok, will work on getting those installed and report back.
23:13:07 <timeo[m]> <TempHlp001 "I can see and transfer files fro">  the drivers works, thats good
23:13:24 <coppermain[m]> <Publius "I know you're jealous, coppermai"> careful buddy
23:13:50 <Publius> Lolz
23:14:05 <coppermain[m]> <timeo[m] " the drivers works, thats good"> i dont help this fools
23:14:19 <coppermain[m]> they are so full of them self
23:14:29 <sphinx[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: TheJollyRoger
23:16:48 <timeo[m]> <TempHlp001 "Ok, will work on getting those i"> But I recommand to use web install with chrome, that work for me
23:17:33 <dannyknoll3[m]> mottel: Try off-topic room, may have better luck
23:17:46 <TempHlp001> Web installer didn't work when I tried. Device was not recognized.
23:18:07 <TempHlp001> I feel like i'm 90% the way there. haha
23:19:23 <mynacol[m]> TempHlp001: The drivers for transferring files (MTP) are different than the ones for fastboot
23:19:23 <timeo[m]> I did got that issue too with device not recognized
23:19:25 <madaidan[m]> <coppermain[m] "why not try out CopperheadOS, th"> Lmao you gave a thumbs up to your own message
23:19:25 <mynacol[m]> So please shut down the phone
23:19:27 <timeo[m]> For me It took  4 / 5 hours too install the os
23:20:26 <mynacol[m]> TempHlp001 And start it in fastboot
23:20:27 <mynacol[m]> * mode
23:20:46 <mynacol[m]> Then connect the phone and look at device manager again
23:21:28 <mynacol[m]> If it is a driver issue you will see a yellow triangle
23:21:36 <timeo[m]> * For me It took  4 / 5 hours too install the os ( but i didn't read instruction in full)
23:22:01 <timeo[m]> * For me It took  4 / 5 hours too install the os since i didn't read instruction in full
23:23:04 <mynacol[m]> Then follow the install guide how to fix it
23:23:12 <mynacol[m]> Gotta go!
23:23:41 <TempHlp001> Seems drivers are good.
23:26:48 <itwillend3[m]> <TempHlp001 "Seems drivers are good."> do you need live support?

23:45:46 <dan-is-a-bloody-> got a question: how to use the android built-in FIDO2 functionality on GrapheneOS? All the guides say you need to login to your google account but obviously graphene is degoogled

23:47:20 <supgeg[m]> CopperheadOS has live support come check it out.
23:47:24 <grapheneos_user_> Let's calmly explain what the situation is.
23:47:25 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <dan-is-a-bloody- "got a question: how to use the a"> I think, FIDO2 relies on Google services on Android ATM and there's no other implementation
23:47:36 <dan-is-a-bloody-> SkyFox [kde.org]: FUCK
23:47:42 <Dylanger[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "I think, FIDO2 relies on Google "> Damn, really?

23:48:41 <dan-is-a-bloody-> dannyknoll3: you probably used an external key, im talking about the pixel's built in chip to act as a FIDO2 key
23:48:49 <supgeg[m]> and stealing our work
23:49:02 <grapheneos_user_> supgeg: Can you actually explain?
23:49:26 <supgeg[m]> look on our forums for more information
