01:51:43 <Zzzzz> Hi everyone, I have a privacy question hoping to get an answer here. GrapheneOS has a network permission setting, and I have been using Gboard with network off. I was wondering if apps like this can exfiltrate data to other apps with network access to upload data it collects.
01:53:17 <rny> Zzzzz: this has been asked many times, you cna search the history about this.
01:53:17 <rockie12[m]> once it stops being supported, can the os still be used (let's say by a noob who can't tweak things much)?
01:53:46 <Zzzzz> Thanks!
01:53:52 <dnull> rockie12[m]: Sure, just gets no further updates
01:53:53 <rny> Zzzzz: generally speaking, it is not a good idea to use the network permission toggle to prevent data exfiltration.
01:54:02 <rockie12[m]> Sorry! Mesage got half erased! Hi everybody! Does anyone know for how long the Pixel 4a (without 5G) will be supported?
01:54:15 <rockie12[m]> <dnull "rockie12: Sure, just gets no fur"> ok!! thanks
01:54:33 <dnull> rockie12[m]: I think the standard is 4 years after release date.
01:54:59 <akc3n> rockie12[m]: https://endoflife.date/pixel
01:55:22 <dnull> akc3n: Nice. Danke.
01:56:17 <rockie12[m]> Oh great info! thanks to both!
01:56:45 <rockie12[m]> that was my last worry. I'm buying a pixel 4a tonight (to install graphene os on it!) :D so excited
01:57:54 <southron[m]> Gratz. Just make sure you get the unlocked version.
01:58:14 <mefistofeles> rockie12[m]: nice
01:58:22 <rockie12[m]> I will!
01:58:59 <sjsndnjdejd> so has anyone done a battery replacement?
01:59:45 <Zzzzz> rny: Got it. Thanks! It seems then there's no way to contain Gboard unless I use a profile where every app is network blocked.
02:13:01 <grapheneos_user_> <rockie12[m] "I will!"> Just to make sure, it should be factory unlocked rather than carrier unlocked
02:13:15 <grapheneos_user_> Carrier unlocked just means any SIM works
02:13:36 <mefistofeles> grapheneos_user_: oh, how does that one make sure of that?
02:13:39 <grapheneos_user_> Bootloader is often permanently locked, even if any SIM works
02:13:42 <mefistofeles> s/that//
02:14:00 <grapheneos_user_> <mefistofeles "grapheneos_user_pi: oh, how does"> By either getting new from Google
02:14:21 <mefistofeles> grapheneos_user_: I see two options from google, google-fi unlocked and plain unlocked
02:14:37 <grapheneos_user_> Or if buying used, ask the person to try toggling "Allow OEM Unlocking"
02:14:46 <grapheneos_user_> <mefistofeles "grapheneos_user_pi: I see two op"> Try plain unlocked
02:14:55 <mefistofeles> ok
02:14:56 <grapheneos_user_> More likely to work, but Google it first
02:14:57 <mefistofeles> thanks
02:16:06 <grapheneos_user_> <mefistofeles "thanks"> Welcome

02:17:59 <Zzzzz> But is there any other concern with data exfiltration beyond app communicating with each other?
02:20:52 <Zzzzz> If I wait for maybe 2 years and come back to GrapheneOS and it has implemented app communication toggling or monitoring or some alternative, would I be able to use Gboard :P
02:21:58 <rny> Zzzzz: there are no plans to implement IPC filtering/logging
02:22:49 <rny> if you cant trust an app developer to not exfiltrate your data, then its probably not a good idea to use the app
02:23:28 <Zzzzz> Yeah sorry it was a hypothetical question. I understand there's a shortage of developer time on the project
02:24:06 <rny> also from a usability standpoint, doesnt sound practical to me to have such a tool
02:24:30 <rny> would a user actually keep monitoring IPC usage?
02:24:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​buMubarak1378> Intel accused of wiretapping because it uses analytics to track keystrokes, mouse movements on its website. Session monitoring scripts prompt dozens of privacy lawsuits against Big Biz, mainly in California and Florida.80 votes (98%) in 2 hours • 7 commentshttps://redd.it/mgprlm
02:26:17 <Zzzzz> rny: Still hypothetical -- maybe a global switch for an app to allow/disallow all IPC, or some whitelisting will be better than the default which is all allow.
02:26:51 <rny> Zzzzz: this breaks a lot of things
02:27:26 <rny> launcher would be broken as an example :P
02:27:49 <Zzzzz> Wouldn't an app still work if it is the only non-bundled app that exists in a system?
02:28:30 <rny> sure, but a system is composed of many processes.
02:28:48 <Zzzzz> Launcher -- you mean like "open in..." dialogs?
02:29:04 <rny> you may not be aware, but there are many background services that also use intents to get set up
02:29:16 <mefistofeles> ls
02:29:19 <mefistofeles> xD
02:29:41 <rny> so it is impractical to disallow IPC
02:29:55 <Zzzzz> Ohhhh. man that's really unexpected
02:30:56 <rny> how to achieve usable privacy through IPC controls would be a long and arduous research project.
02:31:08 <rny> you can probably publish some papers on it in USENIX security
02:32:43 <Zzzzz> Man, that's probably outside my scope of understanding :P

02:36:47 <strcat[m]> thread
02:43:07 <Zzzzz> Sad to see GrapheneOS attracting so much drama lately
02:45:41 <mefistofeles> I don't really see it, I blame twitter or similar
02:45:41 <mefistofeles> :)
03:20:54 <pinkylittlecat[m> drama gives me headache, i rather leave someone dedicated to it instead of wasting my time with it, i'd be literally crazy if i had to deal with all this stuff.
03:20:54 <pinkylittlecat[m> by the way, i still need to start messing with the code here to get something done, how intimidating is it to start from zero a dev environment to build the grapheneOS rom and test stuff? im not asking **how** to do it, i just want to prepare psychologically before actually doing it
03:22:08 <mefistofeles> pinkylittlecat[m: totally, the drama addiction of modern society is just so stupid
03:22:28 <pinkylittlecat[m> lemme join the offtopic room, sec
03:22:34 <mefistofeles> oh, there is one?
03:22:39 <mefistofeles> sorry
03:23:21 <pinkylittlecat[m> yeah i rather not discuss it here
03:37:12 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it's easy to build as long as you have a decent connection and hardware
03:37:22 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: the instructions aren't hard
03:37:30 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: you need a lot of disk space, bandwidth and CPU cores
03:37:46 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: it will take a *looong* time to do a clean build from scratch on weak hardware
03:38:17 <pinkylittlecat[m> well i already built element on my own, 3 projects to spit out just one. i suppose building a whole system takes a bit more of time right? xD
03:38:30 <pinkylittlecat[m> element-desktop*
03:44:02 <strcat[m]> pinkylittlecat: I was working on using OVH to implement a CI system for GrapheneOS and I build locally in containers so I know exactly what's required from the build env
03:44:19 <strcat[m]>  * pinkylittlecat: I was working on using OVH Public Cloud instances to implement a CI system for GrapheneOS and I build locally in containers so I know exactly what's required from the build env
03:44:34 <strcat[m]> and it's documented well, at least for something comparable to where I test
03:47:15 <strcat[m]> need to figure out best way of doing headless emulator testing for the CI setup
03:47:36 <strcat[m]> headless X11 instance is basically all that's needed for that so QEMU can output graphics somewhere
03:47:49 <strcat[m]> nested KVM was working fine
03:49:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> So are you building grapheneos on ovh hardware?
03:50:06 <strcat[m]> no
03:50:10 <strcat[m]> I'm talking about setting up CI
03:50:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Ah okay
03:50:22 <strcat[m]> our release builds are built locally on dedicated hardware with a dedicated signing machine
03:50:25 <strcat[m]> and so are development builds
03:50:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Nice. What kind of specs you have in that beast? If you wanna share
03:50:47 <rny> output graphics to /dev/null
03:50:48 <strcat[m]> it would be really impractical to do development builds remotely and download them for testing because those are 30 second to a few minute incremental builds
03:50:50 <rny> :P
03:51:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Yeah i believe that
03:51:13 <strcat[m]> but sometimes it would be nice to do a bunch of parallel remote builds to check the result of something
03:51:31 <strcat[m]> such as when narrowing down which security or privacy feature in GrapheneOS is uncovering an upstream bug in the OS or an app
03:51:37 <strcat[m]> which is the first step to figuring out how to resolve it
03:51:44 <strcat[m]> need to know what causes the problem to be uncovered
03:51:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Qubes os has something called openqa just discovered that but no idea how it works
03:51:54 <strcat[m]> such as hardened_malloc uncovering a use-after-free bug in some upstream code
03:52:20 <strcat[m]> so step 1 is doing a build with likely culprits disabled, then narrowing it down more specifically
03:52:32 <strcat[m]> figuring out which feature or part of the design in hardened_malloc uncovers the issue
03:52:40 <strcat[m]> so that involves just making builds + testing
03:52:56 <strcat[m]> then when what uncovers it is known, it's time to actually start narrowing it down and debugging it
03:53:09 <strcat[m]> figuring out exactly what happens, which code is at fault, figuring out how to fix it or at least work around it
03:53:12 <strcat[m]> that's a really common need
03:53:24 <strcat[m]> sometimes need to do 15+ different builds or more to narrow down what uncovers a problem
03:53:34 <pinkylittlecat[m> testing strategy also matters a lot
03:53:38 <strcat[m]> and it would be nice to have it scripted so that a test case could be made for the emulator
03:53:51 <strcat[m]> and narrowing it down could be largely done on CI infrastructure
03:53:55 <strcat[m]> and automated to some extent
03:54:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Yeah that isnt fun at all in my opinion to built it too many times and still not getting answer why build would fail
03:54:16 <strcat[m]> that's why I was looking at using OVH public cloud instances
03:54:34 <strcat[m]> also because this often requires doing clean builds to reliably narrow it down
03:54:36 <strcat[m]> not incremental ones
03:54:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Have u ever looked at buyvm? They have nice specs
03:55:14 <strcat[m]> for this we need instances billed by the minute or at least hour
03:55:34 <strcat[m]> https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/public-cloud/prices/#compute
03:56:12 <strcat[m]> those 32 core CPU instances can do a fully clean build from scratch in 1 hour, can likely be made better with some optimization
03:56:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Hetzner has instances billed by hour
03:56:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> But they would be located in germany tho
04:02:59 <rny> even on a noisy co-tenanted machine?
04:03:33 <rny> if you're buying VCPUs, you're still competing for resources with other tenants on the same physical instance
04:04:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> In my experience i havent had any performance issues with hetzner
04:04:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> They have 10gb network with cloud and epyc cpus
04:06:14 <strcat[m]> rny: the OVH public cloud instance have guaranteed resources
04:06:21 <strcat[m]>  * rny: the OVH public cloud instances have guaranteed resources
04:06:27 <strcat[m]> they aren't comparable to the VPS offerings
04:06:36 <strcat[m]> they are much more expensive per hour
04:06:40 <strcat[m]> but billed by minute/hour
04:06:51 <strcat[m]> the prices are listing as per hour but I think the billing granularity is per minute
04:07:46 <strcat[m]> they don't have particularly modern CPUs at least in the BHS data centre
04:08:00 <strcat[m]> that's why 32 core takes an hour
04:08:11 <strcat[m]> it might be substantially better if the kernel side channel mitigations are turned off
04:08:23 <strcat[m]> the security doesn't matter at all for the use case
04:09:40 <rny> lovely
04:12:32 <strcat[m]> the side channel mitigations have hurt a lot on my workstation and I can't turn them off
04:12:34 <strcat[m]> they're important
04:12:37 <strcat[m]> really annoying
05:25:00 <Zzzzz> Hi again, sorry if this is asked before, but is there a way to get notification from a second profile while in the owner profile? I tried searching the log but no solution came up.
05:56:32 <rahoon_goaway[m]> How advisable is it to use a pixel 2(which is marked as obsolete on the site) with GOS?
05:56:33 <rahoon_goaway[m]> Are they no longer maintined at all, or only recieve some updates, or what?
05:58:14 <Zzzzz> I think it's covered in https://grapheneos.org/faq#legacy-devices
05:58:40 <Zzzzz> safety is not guaranteed from the looks of it

06:08:37 <akc3n> yoge67855[m]: ? Please don't spam.
06:18:22 <Zzzzz> > is there a way to get notification from a second profile while in the owner profile?
06:18:22 <Zzzzz> I guess I saw someone saying it's possible but the user needs to be active, but stackoverflow says only one user can be active...
06:20:26 <strcat[m]> akc3n: seems like an attempt at a joke, not spamming
06:21:02 <strcat[m]> but... don't exactly want people running that to learn about fork bombs
06:22:11 <strcat[m]> rahoon_goaway: Pixel 2 is insecure regardless of what's used on it, we kinda still support it, and we'll do some work to fix a bit more than AOSP does alone, but not much, and it simply isn't possible to provide the full security updates
06:23:24 <strcat[m]> if it was our own hardware, we could do a bit more
06:23:28 <strcat[m]> but not much
06:24:02 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't have the resources or expertise to take over maintaining stuff and some stuff is inherently out-of-scope and what we could
06:24:10 <strcat[m]> like Wi-Fi firmware, etc.
06:24:45 <strcat[m]> even if the SoC is designed so that the OEM can be the one signing it, doesn't mean it's actually possible for the OEM to maintain it when the vendor updates end
06:29:02 <akc3n[m]> <strcat[m] "akc3n: seems like an attempt at "> Ohh, okay. Gotcha. I wasn't sure. Thank you for clarifying.
06:29:55 <somenerd[m]> > but... don't exactly want people running that to learn about fork bombs
06:29:55 <somenerd[m]> yeah lol
06:42:29 <Zzzzz> Have to go, if anyone can confirm it's not possible to get notification from another user, thanks in advance
07:05:41 <rahoon_goaway[m]> OK thank, strcat and Zzzzz
07:09:04 <rahoon_goaway[m]> So security here seems to be a chip firmware problem, as we don't know enough about the chips to maintian their firmware, have to rely  on the OEM for that.
07:10:22 <rahoon_goaway[m]> What security issues does old firmware pose then?
07:11:48 <rahoon_goaway[m]> I see many old old old android devices functioning, and many get considerably faster when you replace the OEM's OS with something like lineageOS.
07:11:49 <rahoon_goaway[m]> What then is the security risk?
07:14:25 <mynacol[m]> rahoon_goaway: Firmware updates are as important as other software updates. As the firmware is generally proprietary, only the vendor can reasonably provide updates (without reverse engineering the hardware).
07:15:07 <rahoon_goaway[m]> OK, I thought firmware was too low-level to matter much for security
07:15:36 <mynacol[m]> rahoon_goaway: As wireless technology (cellular, Bluetooth, NFC) is handled by firmware first, firmware can be exploited
07:16:50 <rahoon_goaway[m]> Right, that makes sense I guess
07:16:50 <rahoon_goaway[m]> Like send a type of signal that fools the actual chip, and the OS doesn't get to know something's wrong.
07:17:13 <mynacol[m]> rahoon_goaway:  This is partly mitigated by having proper IOMMU, preventing uncontrolled DMA
07:18:14 <mynacol[m]> No expert about this, but might give you an idea
07:21:26 <rahoon_goaway[m]> OK thanks a lot mynacol

09:24:05 <kindness> What is the .zip.sig file?
09:31:46 <akc3n> kindness: the sig file is a cryptographic signature, which verifies the integrity of factory images.

11:15:31 <taymason> I am using a pixel 4a and am having issues with the screen sensitivity. I do not have a screen protector but sometimes will get phantom touches while scrolling online or while typing. Any help on fixing this would be great. Thanks!
11:22:58 <akc3n> taymason: Sounds like you either may possibly have a hardware issue, some kind of accessibility service enabled that might be sketchy, or configuration settings changed perhaps? Is your device in a case?
11:23:46 <M---------------> taymason: 4a user here. I noticed that too but realized it was my own hand at the edge of the display. 4a seems to have a display that is easily touchable by accident by the inside of the hand. Obviously also depends on the hand. Sure that is not an issue?
11:24:16 <taymason> OK. No, my phone is not in a case either. I have been reading that android 11 had a bug with the 4a but wasn't sure if the grapheneos is aware of it or fixed it?
11:25:27 <taymason> That could be possible. I've switched from an iPhone SE do still getting used to it. I havnt  thought if that.
11:27:44 <taymason> Are there setting in the accessibility service I could look at? I just have noticed that the sensitivity of this phone is crazy. Just the slightest touch and I type the wrong key or open a link when I thought I was still scrolling.
11:34:05 <taymason> akc3n: not in a case
11:35:32 <taymason> akc3n: first time using freenode. So I don't know if you saw my other messages.
11:35:58 <akc3n> taymason: If you had already set your system navigation to gesture, then go system settings -> accessibility -> system navigation -> gesture navigation -> tap the gear icon on the rigt side, and adjust/test.
11:37:22 <akc3n> yes, I have.
11:39:46 <taymason> Got it. I've had that the settings to low for the past week and still have issues. And it only has an option for the "back sensitivity" but no other options
11:43:08 <akc3n> taymason: If you can, please try purchasing a case for your device, and see if that will resolve this. I have heard of similar experiences in the past from only a couple people, which was solved by putting the phone in acase. While others had hardware issues.
11:49:11 <natenbrowning[m]> <akc3n "natenbrowning: https://github.co"> There's a lot of great info in there however it still doesn't answer my question.

12:47:40 <Sam20> Hi, is anyone available for Graphene installation troubleshooting advice?
12:48:32 <Sam20> At the step of fastboot flash bootloader, it is returning "FAILED (remote: "invalid magic")
12:49:52 <Sam20> It's a Pixel 3 if that matters
12:51:38 <tom-griffin[m]> what OS are you on? I'd also follow this guide if you haven't It's pretty good https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=xIXAzA555xk Sam20
12:51:50 <Sam20> Fedora 33
12:52:10 <tom-griffin[m]> do you have USB debugging enabled?
12:53:09 <Sam20> Sorry, on the phone?
12:53:15 <tom-griffin[m]> yes
12:53:42 <Sam20> Yes, I followed the steps in the CLI guide: https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
12:54:13 <Sam20> OEM unlocking done, fastboot unlocked the bootloader.
12:54:52 <Sam20> However, I couldn't get fastboot to work as non-root, so.. I ran as root (not sure if that's a terrible thing)
12:55:18 <tom-griffin[m]> not sure then only advise I have is to google the error if you haven't already
12:56:21 <Sam20> I currently am, but there's not low hanging fruit answers yet..]

15:08:50 <castleinthesky> I just installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3XL, and it was so straightforward. I used the web install method, and I'm really happy with how easy it was, and also how many apps work on GrapheneOS.
15:09:21 <castleinthesky> I was putting it off for a long time, afraid of the inconvenience. I wish I'd done it sooner.
15:21:11 <grapheneos_user_> castleinthesky: no worries, welcome!
15:56:32 <pgt> I can verify the web installer works fine for my Pixel 5. I've installed it because of hardened kernel + hardened userland I had issues using fastboot for flashing. Thanks a lot for your hard work. Also thanks to anthraxx for the hardened kernel patches.
15:56:57 <pgt> *installed it via web installer
15:57:21 <strcat[m]> linux-hardened originates as part of the GrapheneOS project btw
15:57:30 <strcat[m]> anthraxx is maintaining the mainline version
15:57:43 <strcat[m]> one day we may be able to invest resources into that again
16:04:18 <pgt> strcat[m]: Yes I know. You all doing a very nice job! Also, soon I will release an hardened arch linux installer (just a bourne shell script) via nullsecurity.net. It will includes the the linux-hardened package, hardened_malloc, and other userland hardening stuff like firejail, apparmor, ACL, iptables, sysctl,... Maybe you are interested in review/test when I am finished
16:06:10 <pgt> the goal is to fully automate the hardening process, also adjust ACLs after package installation/updates
16:06:22 <pgt> anyway
16:10:31 <strcat[m]> pgt: suggest looking at madaidan.'s hardening guide and avoid firejail
16:10:39 <strcat[m]> I won't have time to help with anything like that
16:11:25 <mUncheR> I just bt paired my Graphene phone with a Lineage phone and my Graphene phone suddenly blinked to the Graphene logo and seemed to log out and login again. It wasn't a reboot.
16:14:43 <pgt> strcat[m]: yeah, the problem is the SUID bit and code base. I know. The question is which alternative is better?
16:15:28 <strcat[m]> mUncheR: sounds like hardened_malloc or another feature detecting an upstream bug
16:15:37 <strcat[m]> you should capture a bug report with the developer options tool for that
16:15:56 <strcat[m]> you can send me it in a Matrix private chat, Element will let you share it if you have it installed
16:16:10 <strcat[m]> or you could manually look at logs with `adb logcat` and get the relevant output but I don't expect you to do that
16:16:21 <mUncheR> Me?
16:18:14 <strcat[m]> yes
16:18:21 <strcat[m]> use bug report capture tool
16:18:27 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#bugs-uncovered-by-security-features
16:19:56 <mUncheR> OK thanks. Do I need to replicate the issue or would the info already be captured?
16:20:37 <pgt> anyway. I will take a look at bubblewrap if it fits my requirements
16:20:53 <pgt> but thanks for the advise strcat[m]
16:27:06 <pgt> gvisor looks also really interesting. anyway this is off-topic here. have a happy easter everyone!
16:27:47 <strcat[m]> pgt: we do have #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org where it would fit better
16:28:22 <pgt> strcat[m]: ok. see you there soon. have a great day

17:37:48 <etksf[m]> a suggestion, wrt screen lock security.
17:37:48 <etksf[m]> at the moment, when selecting "pattern" as a screen lock option, the user can only create a pattern on a 3x3 matrix.
17:37:48 <etksf[m]> my suggestion is to allow larger sizes, such as 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6 for tighter security

18:11:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​andyberlin> I installed accidently the graphene version for 4a 5g on my normal 4a
18:11:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​andyberlin> Now I cant Start the phone :(
18:12:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​andyberlin> What can I do?
18:14:32 <nscnt[m]> @Handyberlin : You asked the same question weeks ago
18:14:41 <nscnt[m]> one (?) week
18:14:45 <nscnt[m]> you can return it
18:15:11 <nscnt[m]> It's bricked
18:16:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​andyberlin> Ok other question.  How do I remove or change the GrapheneOS during boot?
18:16:52 <Thatcher[m]> <nscnt[m] "It's bricked"> Is it possible to undo a bricking by unlocking the bootloader again?
18:17:15 <nscnt[m]> It's called a brick for a reason

18:21:07 <nscnt[m]> Thatcher: It's hard to brick, but if you do, there's nothing you can do
18:22:23 <nscnt[m]> If you can still fix it, it's not a brick
18:23:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's so easy to brick
18:23:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Erase sbl1 for both slots and wait
18:23:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or abl
18:24:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> RMA
18:24:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We cannot help
18:25:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Flashing the wrong file overwrites the partition table with an invalid one
18:25:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ComplicatedPenguin> Then there is no way to fix it?
18:28:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> No
18:28:27 <TheJollyRoger> I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do for you. At this point, you'll need to send it back.

18:37:09 <Gravity_is_a_lie> I have some questions about the profile feature : Can I get notifications from an app that is installed on another profile ? How safe is it to install closed sourced app on an empty profile ?
18:42:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ComplicatedPenguin> I think you can(I don't use work profile rn but I remember I could receive notification) and can I ask what is the problem with the app being closed source? Or you mean something else from closed source?I didn't understand the second question.
18:43:24 <Gravity_is_a_lie> Like if i install my banking app or something that i know will try to track me, sorry it wasn't very clear

18:49:37 <timetravelingman> Or system64 if you're on a newer processor
18:49:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ComplicatedPenguin> Oh ok.Yes, it is safe. It is much better to isolate apps that you don't think are trustworthy from your main profile. They have totally separated environment.https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles
19:07:56 <sphinx[m]> @ComplicatedPenguin work profiles are a different thing and not what the project encourages for that use case

19:21:44 <ransome> Is there a way to downgrade to a GrapheneOS release that is based on Android 10? My Pixel 3a turned into a laggy pita and since I havent done any weird "tuning", have no ressource  intensive apps installed and am reading complaints of 3a users who upgraded to Android 11 and regret it, I assume Android 11 and 3a are just not meant to be together
19:22:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Should i keep using work profile for apps that i dont need everyday and those apps which probably collect some data about me or make separate user for them?
19:24:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !rob has joined the Telegram Group!
19:25:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X​a_bi> Android 11 is snappier on my pixel 3 than what android 10 was
19:26:03 <ransome> mmhh, opposite for me :(
19:26:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X​a_bi> All my devices upgraded to 11 are faster, included galaxy a8 2018
19:26:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X​a_bi> Try a factory reset
19:26:46 <user1182[m]> Hey guys, I believe I may have bricked my device, after flashing and relocking bootloader I am receiving a "no valid slot to boot" error. I followed an outdated guide on the internet. Using the newest versions of platform tools and 4a release. Could someone point me in the right direction? Much appreciated
19:27:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X​a_bi> I dont see the point in using an outdated secure OS, it s not secure anymore.
19:27:25 <ransome> I was thinking about a factory reset, but I tried to avoid it always comes with one whole evening restoring everything :D
19:30:02 <ransome> is there any way on Android to see running processes and how much CPU and RAM they use? Something like top or Glances on Linux
19:31:10 <accelerate[m]> <ransome "is there any way on Android to s"> Not an expert, but you can run "top" through adb. Howerver you are not going to see much if you are not root
19:33:46 <GrapheneUser> Should Vanadium be making an outgoing connection to Microsoft’s Azure cloud service when opened? 40.89.244.232:443
19:35:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ComplicatedPenguin> I know about that. Multi users are a hassle IMO for that use case. That person only want to use one app that is untrusted in his idea. Work profile has totally separated storage areas and apps in work profile can't access apps in other profile.But another user can be a better option in the end.Idk. If I misunderstood or said bullshit plz say.Thanks anyway :)
19:39:33 <mynacol[m]> In this case the isolation of storage etc. is controlled by the work profile app. The system provides user profiles with strict isolation of storage etc., therefore more trustworthy
19:43:53 <nscnt[m]> user1182: You're probably fine. Follow one of the official installation guides from the beginning. The WebUSB-based installation is recommended for most users: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
19:44:46 <user1182[m]> thank you
19:45:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ComplicatedPenguin> True.

20:48:23 <jprince602[m]> will a pixel4a refushished off ebay work? or should I just look at getting a brand new 4a
20:52:07 <TheJollyRoger> jprince602[m]: We advise against buying used because as time goes on, the market becomes increasingly saturated with bootloader-locked devices, and becomes a veritable minefield of not getting what you paid for, since a lot of the time at the retailers, the people being paid seven bucks an hour to sling the phones just throw them all in the same bin.
20:52:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: that or you get stolen EVT/DVT boards

20:53:24 <jprince602[m]> okay thanks, ill just buy it new.
20:53:27 <TheJollyRoger> jprince602[m]: this channel is full of horror stories about people buying devices that their sellers have claimed were "unlocked" and getting a verizon-locked device that is still usable off Verizon, but that cannot have its bootloader unlocked, and the seller then vanishing or refusing to take back the ends.
20:53:35 <TheJollyRoger> jprince602[m]: Good plan!
20:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: yikes.
20:54:32 <jprince602[m]> yeah I hear ya, I bought prior used from ebay and it has happened to me, where i bought unlocked phones but turned out they were still locked etc.
20:54:42 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow that really sucks.
20:54:57 <jprince602[m]> So a new 4a is what I am looking for?
20:55:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. On the Google Store, you will want to select "Unlocked" or "Carrier Agnostic."
20:55:31 <jprince602[m]> okay thats what I was looking for, where and what to select. Thanks alot
20:55:40 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! Welcome aboard the ship!

21:20:13 <ryanrambharose[7> i forgot my password how can i reset my phone?
21:20:15 <ryanrambharose[7> nvm
21:21:27 <ryanrambharose[7> for future reference how do i?
21:23:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hi ryanrambharose[7, if you have forgotten your phone password and been locked out, I can walk you through the process to factory reset it via recovery, but you will lose everything and there is NO RECOVERY from this even if you find the password in the future.
21:24:08 <flawedworld[m]> <ryanrambharose[7 "for future reference how do i?"> As the device (like any modern android phone) is encrypted and if you forget your password, you would have to erase userdata via recovery mode consequently losing the data
21:24:09 <TheJollyRoger> No ifs, ands, or buts, you will lose everything on that phone.
21:25:16 <ryanrambharose[7> <TheJollyRoger "Hi ryanrambharose, if you have f"> i remember it but the what is the process to do so
21:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> The procedure is to enter recovery first. You must switch off your phone, then boot to bootloader via the combo keys (Volume Down, Power, hold down for ten seconds), then entering recovery, bringing up the recovery menu by tapping the volume down and power keys (Hold down power, tap volume down, release both, if I recall right) once you're there, which should bring you to a menu that says
21:26:38 <TheJollyRoger> "factory reset." Select it by using the volume keys, then tap and release the power key once.
21:27:40 <TheJollyRoger> Once you've done this, the phone will change its access tokens, and all data on the phone will be lost. You'll be given a fresh start and return to GrapheneOS once your phone finishes rebooting.
21:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, I can't stress this enough: there is no undelete nor recovery from this even if you find your copy of the password at a later date.

23:26:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> It is easy.
23:26:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> The guide on the website is always updated, so there is no risk in following it.
23:27:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Also, it is possible to unlock the bootloader inside fastboot,

23:42:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Le marchand de rêves> Would it be possible to have some details about those dummy FLOSS gapps replacements mentioned?Will it have some of the effects of microG improving apps compatibility and allowing us to use apps that currently don't work?Is there an ETA for that yet?
23:42:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!LevelUp> seems good looking.  Do I have to download the factor image again and again in the future or is it now saved until the next update?

23:52:18 <akc3n> @Le marchand de reves: here is brief explaination by TheJollyRoger on the logbot regarding a few details: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210314#c7246156
23:53:40 <akc3n> Also please read the official details here https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
23:55:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> The updates roll out quickly, so you probably will not need to keep an image.
23:55:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Images should be downloaded again, too, in case corruption happens.
23:57:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> So the answe is no.
