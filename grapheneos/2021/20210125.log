00:03:33 <Serus> Def
00:04:52 <Serus> yeah, a pixel 4a is €350
00:05:14 <Serus> Second hand website lists them as new, so maybe cheaper to get it from an actual store
00:05:16 <Serus> but still
00:05:18 <Serus> pricey
00:06:46 <Serus> "Google pixel 3 in good condition (broken screen)", thought this was a phone in good condition lmao
00:08:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Do I need a github account to download the source? I'm getting an error from git "Committee identity unknown"
00:09:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Looks like it wants an email address or some crap?
00:09:22 <Serus> You need an account to push
00:09:28 <Serus> is this over ssh or https?
00:09:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> https
00:09:52 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm using repo init on Arch linux
00:09:55 <Serus> That should just work™
00:10:17 <Serus> You don't use a DNS that blacklists github, no?
00:10:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> No. Just using a common VPN
00:11:16 <Serus> Ah
00:11:24 <Serus> Maybe some bot detection for that VPN
00:11:34 <Serus> switch servers and see if that helps
00:11:38 <Serus> Or try without VPN
00:12:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> I was able to fill in a dummy email address and it seems OK with it. "nobody⊙nc"
00:13:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> Weird.
00:13:42 <Serus> oh, right
00:13:53 <Serus> repo needs an identity set
00:14:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm going to see if I can run one of the generic build targets on a raspberry pi. As of yet I have no idea what I'm doing.
00:15:15 <Serus> so you in a week when it finishes compiling lmao
00:15:18 <Serus> or 3 weeks
00:15:24 <cyborgninjaneer[> Well, I have a vague idea, just don't know how to actually make the pi run it
00:15:36 <Serus> When I compiled lineageos it had 102K source files
00:15:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah... This is probably going to suck.
00:24:05 <JeanBlanc> Hello. Brand new install of Graphene OS on PIxel 4a. I moved from MacOS & iOs to  Linux Mint and Graphene Os this weekend. Trying to get up to speed. Can't stand the idea of Google, FB, Apple spying on me. Anyway, I'd like to install a couple apps like Signal and/or Telegram, as well as a VPN. Is F-Droid the way to go about this with Graphene?
00:24:36 <Serus> signal is not on f-droid sadly
00:24:53 <Serus> you can download the apk from their website, it is self updating though
00:26:15 <JeanBlanc> Ok cool. Thanks. Good to know
00:27:17 <rny> JeanBlanc: please read history RE: fdroid
00:29:51 <JeanBlanc> @rny I will do some searching
00:30:22 <JeanBlanc> I landed here from a reddit thread.
00:42:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> You can land in a lot of shitty places from reddit threads. I'm glad you found your way to a good one instead.
01:02:23 <JeanBlanc> Totally agree. Thank you. I am a total noob. Is there a directory of apps that are sufficiently degoogled and privacy focused?
01:03:34 <JeanBlanc> I am not sure what to trust online, frankly
01:05:28 <rny> JeanBlanc: every app your run on grapheneos that is not an app written by google is "degoogled"
01:05:38 <rny> since there's no play services, they cant speak to google
01:11:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> They can talk to other stuff though, so proprietary crap like Discord still isn't ideal.
01:12:36 <JeanBlanc> Yeah, makes sense, unless apps use crap like Google Analytics or Google Cloud hosting
01:37:42 <frontman[m]> Serus: pixel 4 is under $300usd in the usa
01:38:13 <frontman[m]> Lightly used ones I mean
02:04:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Personally, I'd get a 4a if possible. Software support lasts an additional year.
02:07:35 <Emerald18> Hi
02:08:13 <deappledapple> Yeah, agreed (on 4a recommendation)
02:08:13 <deappledapple> Also hello there
02:08:13 <Emerald18> Amy updates coming soon?
02:08:27 <deappledapple> There is just one recently
02:08:27 <Emerald18> Whats the 4A reccomendation?
02:08:57 <deappledapple> <Emerald18 "Amy updates coming soon?"> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.01.23.03
02:09:13 <deappledapple> <Emerald18 "Whats the 4A reccomendation?"> A message earlier, see freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
02:09:44 <Emerald18> Thanks
02:10:38 <Emerald18> Beta update currenly?
02:10:47 <Emerald18> Moving to Stable soon?
02:11:32 <deappledapple> Yeah, it's currently in Beta, if there is not much critical bugs on it, will move on Stable soon
02:11:56 <Emerald18> Greate
02:15:11 <Emerald18> I donated $1 to graphene soon
02:15:49 <rny> you donated soon?
02:18:01 <Emerald18> Yes few days ago $16 total so far
02:18:19 <Emerald18> My internal timeline
02:18:35 <Emerald18> I was thinking about when i was donating, then returned to the present and said soon
02:19:06 <Emerald18> I need a mega dose of the sacred magellin
02:21:02 <lasseter[m]> <TheJollyRoger "lasseter: glad to hear you're li"> Yup.  I was going to give it a few weeks, but I'm convinced.  I'll donate maybe €50 worth later today.  This project is a big deal and I want to see it continue.  Thanks all!
02:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> lasseter[m]: You rock! On behalf of the project we appreciate it!
02:26:55 <lasseter[m]> Sent.  Thanks again.
02:37:14 <whhoops[m]> Does microg core services go against the purpose of graphene is?
02:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> lasseter[m]: much appreciated!
02:43:00 <TheJollyRoger> whhoops[m]: yes. When we consider Play services invasive, it doesn't make sense to just implement them all over again with a version made by a third party.
02:52:04 <pacman37[m]> I'm bit confused about scoped storage and shared storage. Apps have access, or can read shared storage, right?
02:52:04 <pacman37[m]> What exactly stored in shared storage?
02:57:43 <rny> pacman37[m]: media files usually
02:58:05 <rny> or files that apps need to share "lazily"
02:58:19 <rny> without using intents/broadcast-receivers appropriately
03:22:04 <kalbasit_> Serus: I ended up buying it new. The used prices for the most part were more expensive than new lol
03:22:45 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit_: ahaha! Fancy that!
03:22:45 <kalbasit_> It's arriving tomorrow, so I guess I'll be doing a lot of reading on the OS today
03:27:27 <strcat> pacman37[m]: if you don't grant an app access, it can't access shared storage beyond their own app-scoped directly, regardless of whether it's a modern app or not
03:27:38 <strcat> app-scoped directory*
03:41:47 <strcat[m]> anyone having issues with the current Beta release?
03:41:50 <strcat[m]> want to push it out via Stable soon
03:41:59 <strcat[m]> mostly changes carrier configuration stuff
03:42:47 <nullnode[m]> Give me a few, I'll push from stable to Beta
03:43:30 <nullnode[m]> that was a quick kick off after switching channels
03:44:11 <take_a_deep_brea> in my usage i have not faced any problems .
03:51:18 <nullnode[m]> Seems good on Sargo, just did a flip from Stable to Beta channel
03:51:22 <nullnode[m]> passes sanity check of all my base apps
03:53:04 <kalbasit_> Any way to add https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Android#adb_setup to the installation instructions for folks using NixOS?
03:54:16 <deappledapple> No issues here in Beta channel
04:03:57 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_: NixOS is not supported for installation . so maybe what you are asking for is support for installation through NixOS
04:05:05 <kalbasit_> take_a_deep_brea: I'm getting my phone tomorrow so I can test the update myself. As far as the fastboot version goes I got 29.0.6-6198805 following the wiki above
04:05:20 <kalbasit_> s/update/install
04:06:44 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_: i do not think you should have an issue installing as long as you use the officially available platform-tools
04:06:59 <take_a_deep_brea> that is the one used for both debian/ubuntu
04:07:32 <kalbasit_> yea that's my point. Although I had to search a bit to land on that page so maybe worth mentioning it somewhere in the installation docs?
04:08:07 <strcat[m]> so you can flash a device with GrapheneOS from another device running GrapheneOS with https://grapheneos.org/install/web
04:09:55 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_: it will be difficult as people already dont find it easy to find the instructions relevant to their OS and some miss intermediate steps and come here . this being the case while the guide is minimal .im sure adding nixos support wont make it an easier read . i see nixOS has signify-bsd
04:09:56 <Essjay[m]> <strcat[m] "anyone having issues with the cu"> I've been on Beta on my 4a all day. no issues.
04:10:24 <take_a_deep_brea> same here , no issues faced all day
04:11:11 <kalbasit_> take_a_deep_brea: yes I was able to verify the download quickly with: nix run nixpkgs#signify -- -Cqp ...
04:11:17 <deappledapple> If that works, GrapheneOS to flash GrapheneOS is nice, as can test if it is OEM unlockable on physical stores right away
04:11:35 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah very nice
04:12:16 <nullnode[m]> <deappledapple "If that works, GrapheneOS to fla"> has anyone been able to get flashing android from another android device working yet?
04:12:18 <take_a_deep_brea> this would make our installation one of  the easiest to follow
04:12:46 <deappledapple> <nullnode[m] "has anyone been able to get flas"> I'd test it if I had another one rn
04:13:04 <deappledapple> Sadly I only have one (lmao)
04:13:07 <somenerd[m]> > this would make our installation one of  the easiest to follow
04:13:07 <somenerd[m]> maybe the easiest out of all of the ones (afaict)
04:13:24 <deappledapple> <take_a_deep_brea "this would make our installation"> Just gonna click them buttons
04:13:25 <nullnode[m]> <deappledapple "I'd test it if I had another one"> I've tried a bunch of times working on doing device backup/restore from another android handset, but always ran into memory limitation issues
04:13:57 <somenerd[m]> > Just gonna click them buttons
04:13:58 <somenerd[m]> yup
04:14:09 <somenerd[m]> and it's similar security to most anyways
04:14:25 <somenerd[m]> (unless you go out of your way to verify the PGP properly)
04:14:55 <deappledapple> Windows can't do that anyways tbh
04:15:16 <somenerd[m]> and getting the package is tough
04:15:20 <deappledapple> <nullnode[m] "I've tried a bunch of times work"> Seems 4GB RAM is not enough?
04:15:26 <nullnode[m]> There is a downside to the web flasher as is, most Group Policy sets will block it(win10/osx), I had that issue earlier switching over from stock again, worked perfect on a clean debian w/chrome.
04:15:50 <somenerd[m]> use chrome on those OSs?
04:16:22 <nullnode[m]> <deappledapple "Seems 4GB RAM is not enough?"> Plus AOSP and the apps overhead
04:16:39 <take_a_deep_brea> true .
04:16:50 <deappledapple> yeah
04:17:13 <nullnode[m]> <somenerd[m] "use chrome on those OSs?"> yup, Google Chrome latest on Windows 10 will not be able to do direct USB communication is you have basic Active Directory setup with solid group policies
04:17:54 <nullnode[m]> So like people who have inTune/Azure managed desktops or run a whole MSFT infrastructure set
04:18:49 <nullnode[m]> I've loved the idea of device2device deployment, it's the most clean and seamless with only two breaking points in the security model. The two devices.
04:19:48 <nullnode[m]> Well sorry three. don't forget the cable.
04:20:13 <strcat> Microsoft Edge is what we'll recommend people use on Windows since they all have it
04:20:30 <strcat> Chrome is fine too
04:20:36 <strcat> but all of them start with Edge
04:20:59 <strcat> atm I list Chromium, Chrome and Edge as supported
04:21:11 <nullnode[m]> Edge has been blessed. but I'm pissed about this widevine key issue now.
04:21:14 <strcat> and it does appear to work fine on Android too
04:21:30 <strcat> I successfully unlocked a device from another and locked it again, I didn't try flashing
04:21:40 <strcat> could try, I assume it works fine tho
04:21:49 <take_a_deep_brea> i guess device to device will be easiest for someone upgrading from another pixel
04:22:01 <strcat> yes because then they have a super reliable USB connection
04:22:05 <strcat> no problems
04:22:12 <strcat> can just install from Vanadium
04:22:17 <strcat> I have to test but I doubt there's any issue
04:22:30 <strcat> it's pretty cool imo
04:22:38 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah .
04:23:18 <nullnode[m]> lol wat
04:23:26 <nullnode[m]> Vanadium and webusb works out the box?
04:23:38 <nullnode[m]> fuck I gotta find a compatible device to test
04:24:15 <take_a_deep_brea> why wouldnt it  ? i think any recent android with chrome should work
04:24:17 <kalbasit_> How to get Signal and Bitwarden installed? I did not find them in F-droid
04:24:38 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit_: to get signal go to https://signal.org/android/apk to find the signed website release version.
04:24:40 <deappledapple> <nullnode[m] "fuck I gotta find a compatible d"> Pixel to Pixel flashing let's go
04:24:43 <strcat[m]> nullnode: yes WebUSB works in Vanadium
04:24:51 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: holy shit that's awesome.
04:24:53 <deappledapple> Nice
04:24:56 <strcat[m]> you can use https://suite.trezor.io/web/ in Vanadium too
04:25:06 <kalbasit_> TheJollyRoger: oh awesome, Thanks!
04:25:10 <nullnode[m]> <strcat[m] "you can use https://suite.trezor"> sick I don't need the manager app anymore
04:25:18 <somenerd[m]> that is so cool
04:25:23 <somenerd[m]> let me be honest lol
04:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> kalbasit_: you can usually find most open source app authors publish on github, and they sign their packages themselves there, rather than let F-Droid sign them on their behalf.
04:26:15 <take_a_deep_brea> that would obsolete so many videos and guides
04:26:27 <take_a_deep_brea> they were already obsolete
04:26:59 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: daaaamn this is gonna be awesome!
04:27:15 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_: the signal apk and signal from play store are different versions
04:27:55 <kalbasit_> TheJollyRoger: I don't see an apk on https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/releases
04:28:04 <kalbasit_> take_a_deep_brea: what do you mean by different versions?
04:28:28 <take_a_deep_brea> signal apk is 5.1.9 play store version is 5.2.3
04:28:46 <nullnode[m]> <kalbasit_ "How to get Signal and Bitwarden "> I'd recommend using Molly and not Signal, they have an F-droid repo maintained and see more entune with our user class.
04:28:47 <kalbasit_> oh I see what you mean
04:29:07 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_:  https://molly.im
04:29:09 <nullnode[m]> > <@freenode_kalbasit_:matrix.org> How to get Signal and Bitwarden installed? I did not find them in F-droid
04:29:10 <nullnode[m]>  * I'd recommend using Molly and not Signal, they have an F-droid repo maintained and seem more entune with our user class.
04:29:38 <take_a_deep_brea> also #freenode_#mollyim:matrix.org
04:30:59 <kalbasit_> nullnode[m]: it's a fork of Signal? Does it communicate with Signal users? I recently moved my entire family to Signal from Whatsapp I can't put them through this again. It was incredible difficult to move my 80 year old dad remotely
04:31:13 <somenerd[m]> I believe so
04:31:27 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that the devs would be happy though
04:31:28 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_: it is interoperable with signal servers
04:31:33 <take_a_deep_brea> and backups
04:31:36 <nullnode[m]> <kalbasit_ "nullnode: it's a fork of Signal?"> yup, it's just a different client, still using the Moxie Signal backend
04:31:42 <kalbasit_> take_a_deep_brea: awesome
04:31:54 <kalbasit_> Thanks guys, this is very informative
04:31:54 <bearded1[m]> kalbasit_: I believe Bitwarden has an Fdroid repo that you can manually add.
04:32:02 <nullnode[m]> I hope Moxie doesn't start getting mad and blocking third party clients :x
04:32:25 <somenerd[m]> I think he already did that
04:32:32 <kalbasit_> bearded1[m]: oh yea, I see the F-Droid button now on GitHub :facepalm:
04:32:48 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_:  you can direct molly-related questions to #freenode_#mollyim:matrix.org  . valldrac the dev behind molly is available in that room
04:33:40 <kalbasit_> take_a_deep_brea: joined. thx for the info
04:34:05 <somenerd[m]> you may also want to join #grapheneos-offtopic
04:34:43 <kalbasit_> done
06:40:59 <lucaszanella[m]> Is it possible to do deterministic builds of AOSP/graphene? The section https://grapheneos.org/build#reproducible-builds talks about reproducible builds. Is this the same thing as deterministic builds? Can I build the same android .img files with she same hashes as someone else? I'm asking because this would only work inside a VM I guess, and I don't see anything about VMs being mentioned. So I guess by
06:40:59 <lucaszanella[m]> reproducible it means another thing.
06:47:24 <strcat> yes it's the same thing
06:47:45 <strcat> you can do reproducible builds pre-signing
06:48:02 <strcat> lucaszanella[m]: you don't need a VM / container
06:48:13 <strcat> lucaszanella[m]: the OS source tree ships the toolchain, etc. used to build it
06:48:27 <strcat> and it builds inside a semi-isolated container (gradually becoming more isolated)
06:49:11 <strcat> Vanadium (Chromium) and kernel builds are definitely reproducible, the rest of the OS should be too, there might be some minor regressions that need fixes
06:50:31 <strcat> lucaszanella[m]: reproducible implies deterministic - deterministic just means you get the same result each time though, I think reproducible is a stronger way of saying what's desired
06:50:45 <strcat> since it implies it can be reproduced elsewhere
07:03:28 <lucaszanella[m]> <strcat "and it builds inside a semi-isol"> is this specific to Graphene os is this something from AOSP?
07:03:35 <strcat[m]> AOSP
07:03:49 <lucaszanella[m]> This is very nice, thanks
07:04:21 <strcat[m]> it's gradually removing dependencies (and ability to have them) on the host OS
07:04:44 <strcat[m]> there's a list of executables from the host OS that are allowed to be seen
07:07:18 <strcat[m]> lucaszanella: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r27/ui/build/paths/config.go#76
07:07:21 <strcat[m]> list of allowed ones
07:07:26 <strcat[m]> already smaller for the next major release
07:08:13 <strcat[m]> similarly dependencies on host libraries are being phased out
07:08:25 <strcat[m]> and the builds of the prebuilt toolchain are reproducible
07:08:50 <strcat[m]> since you build it from a specific set of source tree revisions which themselves provide the toolchain
07:09:05 <strcat[m]>  * since you build it from a specific set of source tree revisions, so you're building the toolchain with a specific other version of it
07:10:48 <strcat[m]> lucaszanella: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r27/clang-r383902b/
07:11:17 <strcat[m]> there's the LLVM toolchain used to build userspace (compiler, linker, assembler, etc.)
07:11:25 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r27/clang-r383902b/manifest_6573524.xml
07:13:23 <lucaszanella[m]> Very good information, thank you very much. I'm trying to understand how the container is launched. I found this: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r27/ui/build/sandbox_linux.go which is about process isolation. Do you mean this? I guess it's not a true container with an image and so, it's sufficient to isolate the process and then use the prebuilt clang binaries.
07:14:35 <strcat[m]> lucaszanella: a container doesn't have to have an image
07:14:38 <strcat[m]> it can be a fs tree
07:14:41 <strcat[m]> which is what it does
07:15:17 <strcat[m]> has more than clang prebuilts
07:16:18 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/build-tools/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r27/linux-x86/bin/
07:16:22 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/build-tools/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r27/path/linux-x86/
07:16:28 <strcat[m]> it uses toybox for the basic *nix utilities
07:16:33 <strcat[m]> etc
07:16:43 <strcat[m]> look at the previous link I gave with the list of allowed commands from the host
07:16:55 <strcat[m]> everything else comes from the source tree
07:17:03 <lucaszanella[m]> Got it :)
07:17:58 <strcat[m]> this is a big part of reproducible builds: having a well-defined environment, which can be built in a reproducible way itself
07:18:58 <strcat[m]> also really helps with making it easier to build and avoiding portability issues
07:20:21 <take_a_deep_brea> are there any other advantages to reproducible buils than portability ?
07:22:11 <strcat[m]> yes
07:22:35 <strcat[m]> makes development easier, helps with identifying problems, makes incrementals smaller
07:23:03 <strcat[m]> it's not good if you don't get the same results being the same code
07:24:16 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah , true .
07:26:17 <somenerd[m]> and possibly more trust
07:26:27 <somenerd[m]> as you can tell if the code is the same or not
07:27:08 <take_a_deep_brea> ye[[
07:27:15 <take_a_deep_brea>  * yep
07:31:44 <dakotah[m]> <strcat[m] "this is a big part of reproducib"> Like docker?
07:32:16 <take_a_deep_brea> yep . without all the docker fuss .
07:33:04 <take_a_deep_brea>  * yep . but without all the docker fuss .
07:34:07 <dakotah[m]> oooo
08:09:33 <genei[m]> Which is best phone for grephene so far
08:10:12 <take_a_deep_brea> genei: pixel 4a is the most economical and will have the longest support
08:10:30 <genei[m]> Thank you so much
08:11:19 <sphinxcat[m]> genei: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
08:11:43 <genei[m]> Does grephene os have something like self destruction or safe erase
08:11:53 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem . also mind you , before installing graphene make sure the installation image name is sunfish . and 4a is NOT the same as 4a 5G
08:12:08 <take_a_deep_brea> just making clarification in case it is needed
08:12:16 <take_a_deep_brea> if you know then nevermind
08:12:38 <take_a_deep_brea> some people ended up bricking their 4a 5G by trying to flash 4a image on it
08:13:02 <genei[m]> Will..  5g is a big mistake
08:13:30 <take_a_deep_brea> why do you think its a big mistake ?
08:13:39 <genei[m]> If ever get hacked
08:13:54 <genei[m]> How many seconds it will take to pull of all your data
08:14:35 <take_a_deep_brea> genei: this is not the room for discussing this . here #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:14:50 <genei[m]> My bad carried away
08:15:05 <genei[m]> <genei[m] "Does grephene os have something "> This was my related question
08:15:46 <take_a_deep_brea> and even there it cannot be mere speculation . those are the rules for both the rooms . as long as discussion is grounded in facts and reality and is productive it is fine .
08:16:54 <genei[m]> No no its not a speculation am talking about the internet speed in  terms of being hacked...
08:17:16 <TheJollyRoger> genei[m]: Factory resetting your device or erasing a profile will make the security chip regenerate keys. This is secure deletion.
08:17:29 <take_a_deep_brea> genei: lets take this to  #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> No recovery, no undelete, no retrieval.
08:18:24 <genei[m]> Perfect
08:18:48 <TheJollyRoger> Simply select the profile and erase it. All the files in that profile are gone, forever.
08:18:53 <genei[m]> How safe its to travel with any questions marks would it make?
08:19:05 <TheJollyRoger> That depends on you, not your phone.
08:19:08 <genei[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Simply select the profile and er"> That's very exciting, I can have more than a profile?
08:19:29 <take_a_deep_brea> i think 16 profiles
08:19:40 <TheJollyRoger> 16. Each one can have a "work" profile for a total of 32.
08:20:09 <genei[m]> Thats sooo exciting
08:20:18 <genei[m]> Can't wait having a pixel 4a
08:20:27 <take_a_deep_brea> TheJollyRoger:  how many can run in background ?
08:20:30 <TheJollyRoger> genei[m]: A good place to start for more information is at https://grapheneos.org/faq as well as the usage guide. There is a section on using profiles.
08:20:45 <TheJollyRoger> take_a_deep_brea: As many as you want! :D
08:21:31 <TheJollyRoger> Something to take note of though is that if you have apps running in foreground that aren't sleeping, that's more drain on the battery though, so keep an eye on what apps you've got running.
08:23:45 <deappledapple> <TheJollyRoger "take_a_deep_breath: As many as y"> Wdym?
08:26:40 <take_a_deep_brea> i asked him how many user profiles can run simultaneously in bg
08:26:54 <deappledapple> Pretty sure only three can run
08:27:08 <deappledapple> as in active
08:27:12 <deappledapple> Pretty sure it is 1 owner + 2 secondary user that can run in GrapheneOS (3 users)
08:27:12 <deappledapple> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/32
08:27:12 <deappledapple> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Settings/pull/16
08:27:37 <deappledapple> The pull requests won't make sense otherwise, and the user would have accepted biometrics
08:27:43 <genei[m]> Cool but when they run simultaneously, 3 of them will drain the battery right
08:27:53 <deappledapple> Depends on the app
08:28:03 <deappledapple> It drains hard with Element on background
08:28:24 <deappledapple> About 10-14 hrs on 3a
08:29:10 <deappledapple> Unless he meant multiple work profiles, can't see how it is as many as you want, am I missing something!
08:29:15 <deappledapple> ?*
08:29:19 <deappledapple> * Unless he meant multiple work profiles, can't see how it is as many as you want, am I missing something?
08:30:59 <take_a_deep_brea> i am not sure myself .
08:31:29 <TheJollyRoger> deappledapple: oh, I see.
08:31:33 <TheJollyRoger> whoop.
08:31:55 <TheJollyRoger> My mistake!
08:32:16 <deappledapple> That's cool, I was a little confused myself at first 😅
08:35:28 <Great_Mitakes> What drive formats can GrapheneOS read from a USB. I need something better than FAT32, but every format other than FAT32 reads the USB as corrupted.
08:35:48 <Great_Mitakes> This is for the Pixel4a
08:36:31 <deappledapple> Not too sure, FAT32 works, NTFS doesn't, no info on other formats
08:36:55 <Albakham[m]> try exfat?
08:37:15 <Great_Mitakes> I tried exfat.
08:37:55 <Great_Mitakes> Did exfat work for you on the pixel 4a?
08:39:09 <Great_Mitakes> It's always possible I messed up on something, so if someone says the format worked for them, I can try it again.
08:39:55 <gross_mango[m]> Only fat32 works as far AS I know
08:40:37 <gross_mango[m]> If it's about the file size: you could try to split the files in smaller parts. There are multiple tools out there for it, e.g. peazip on desktop
08:41:32 <Great_Mitakes> How does one make suggestions for adding additional drive formats to GrapheneOS?
08:42:18 <Great_Mitakes> gross_mango[m] Thanks, I'll look at that.
08:42:48 <take_a_deep_brea> Great_Mitakes: if you have a github account you could create an issue and make it as a feature request . but the best you can do is ask why addition drive formats arent already supported
08:43:12 <take_a_deep_brea> ask in this room i mean
08:45:11 <take_a_deep_brea> i think that it would increase kernel size and also it will be obviously more maintenance . and supporting usb drives with support for more file systems just increases attack surface
08:47:06 <Great_Mitakes> take_a_deep_brea It's probably the original design of the android os for the pixel 4a. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't GrapheneOS just focus on the removing the proprietary, tracking, and google-specific items, while otherwise providing the original operating system designed for the specific device?
08:47:19 <somenerd[m]> AOSP is degoogled
08:47:34 <somenerd[m]> and GrapheneOS adds hardening to AOSP
08:47:47 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
08:47:55 <take_a_deep_brea> Great_Mitakes:  now would be a good time for  https://grapheneos.org/features
08:48:20 <Great_Mitakes> Thank you
08:48:40 <take_a_deep_brea> also https://grapheneos.org/faq#roadmap
08:49:01 <take_a_deep_brea> so we are more ambitious then degoogling!

08:50:31 <Great_Mitakes> I'm probably just going to use ftp with the phone's hot spot.
08:51:33 <Great_Mitakes> Thanks for the help.
08:51:55 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem
09:32:06 <whoknowsz00[m]> when will it.be available for samsung phones
09:34:01 <take_a_deep_brea> whoknowsz00: graphene OS will support device X when device X : has working implementation for all baseline AOSP security , makes regular formware updates available . and allows flashing of custom keys for verified boot
09:35:30 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
09:35:40 <strcat[m]> it needs to meet all of the requirements and be a compelling device for us to support, and have maintainers volunteering to do the work on it
09:35:51 <strcat[m]> not aware of any Samsung device that would meet our requirements
09:35:54 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah this too
09:38:56 <take_a_deep_brea> samsung does not make it easy to get back to Stock OS in the unfortunate circumstance one needs to do so
09:43:48 <whoknowsz00[m]> what is the safest smartphone ever?
09:45:42 <take_a_deep_brea> a latest grapheneOS on a recent pixel device without any additional apps goes a ling way
09:45:52 <take_a_deep_brea>  * a latest grapheneOS on a recent pixel device without any additional apps goes a long way
09:46:07 <take_a_deep_brea> towards being very secure
09:46:27 <take_a_deep_brea> iOS too
09:46:48 <take_a_deep_brea> but graphene is better as things get fixed way faster
09:47:08 <whoknowsz00[m]> is pixel phones not owned by google? google is the worst enemy right
09:47:09 <take_a_deep_brea> and no Public relations bullshit

10:14:05 <take_a_deep_brea> and the pixel will appear as a usb device on your linux systems file manager
10:14:51 <take_a_deep_brea>  * brunoyerma: #2 you can just plugin the device and you should see a notification that asks you what kind of connection you want to establish . there is an option for file transfer in the same notification along with an option for just charging the device
10:17:17 <brunoyerma[m]> The Pixel does appear, but no question asked, on the phone nor on the PC screen. However, I confirm it works as described with another usual Android phone.
10:19:10 <take_a_deep_brea> check the notificatio panel on pixel
10:19:58 <brunoyerma[m]> Ok. What do I have to check, specifically? 😇
10:20:36 <take_a_deep_brea> do you see any notification saying device is connected via usb?
10:21:11 <brunoyerma[m]> No notification at all on the screen of the phone.
10:21:37 <take_a_deep_brea> Charging this device vis USB Tap for more options ?
10:21:44 <take_a_deep_brea> nothing like that ?

10:27:13 <brunoyerma[m]> No message at all, when I connect the Pixel to the Linux PC with the genuine USB-C cable.
10:27:13 <brunoyerma[m]> I can see the Pixel is connected, because it appears on the screen of the PC. But if I click on it, nothing happens. I also push the cable the bottom of the plug. I checked: it's well connected. 😇
10:29:28 <take_a_deep_brea> which linux distribution is this?
10:30:22 <take_a_deep_brea> even  the pixel device does not show anything ?
10:32:42 <brunoyerma[m]> It's Linux Mint 20.
10:32:43 <brunoyerma[m]> The Pixel does not show any message. I tried three times. I thought it was a protection feature by GrapheneOS. 😇
10:33:57 <take_a_deep_brea> hmmm. no it is supposed to show notification when connected vis usb to computer . have you disable any notifications?
10:34:06 <take_a_deep_brea>  * hmmm. no it is supposed to show notification when connected vis usb to computer . have you disabled any notifications?

10:39:37 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem . if you stick around for a while someone who happens to know better will sort this out quickly.
10:40:04 <brunoyerma[m]> Ok. 😊
10:42:57 <brunoyerma[m]> Thinking about another question.
10:42:57 <brunoyerma[m]> Is installing an anti-virus software like Bitdefender and an ad/privacy tracker with a VPN (Blokada) worth it?
10:44:01 <somenerd[m]> > is pixel phones not owned by google? google is the worst enemy right
10:44:01 <somenerd[m]> they are, but there's no proof on anything malicious
10:44:34 <somenerd[m]> they're one of the most secure devices that GrapheneOS can build upon

10:44:46 <somenerd[m]> > Is installing an anti-virus software like Bitdefender and an ad/privacy tracker with a VPN (Blokada) worth it?
10:44:46 <somenerd[m]> depends
10:44:57 <somenerd[m]> enumerating badness isn't really suggested here
10:45:28 <somenerd[m]> about tracking, websites can just run first-party tracking code
10:45:36 <somenerd[m]> offtopic discussion though
10:45:56 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
10:45:56 <brunoyerma[m]> Depends on?

10:46:33 <take_a_deep_brea> brunoyerma: threat models are discussed in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
10:47:20 <brunoyerma[m]> Usual websurfing, mainly.
10:47:20 <somenerd[m]> most tangential topics are discussed there
10:47:20 <brunoyerma[m]> But I planned to install apps from Aurora, so I expect some tracking from them. 😇
10:48:23 <brunoyerma[m]> Allright. 😇

12:52:23 <fll[m]> <liberate-your-te "Greetings all :) Is there a vers"> anupritaisno1 probably knows most about that
12:52:34 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
13:02:53 <nscnt[m]> liberate-your-tech: Yes, it is being tested. The last thing he said is that there are enough testers for the Pixel 5. However, testers for the Pixel 4a (4G) are still needed.
13:21:23 <liberate-your-te> <nscnt[m] "liberate-your-tech: Yes, it is b"> Thanks nscnt! Did you mean the 4a 5G right? I'm really interested in the 5 for its tougher body and IP68 rating, not so much 5G capabilities. Is there someone I could contact and ask to be added to a waiting list  or some kind? Anupritaisno1?
13:26:34 <nscnt[m]> 5G, yeah
13:26:40 <nscnt[m]>  * liberate-your-tech: Yes, it is being tested. The last thing he said is that there are enough testers for the Pixel 5. However, testers for the Pixel 4a (5G) are still needed.
13:29:49 <nscnt[m]> anupritaisno1 is the person in charge, yes. However, I doubt that there's any waiting list. It will have an official release eventually. There are enough testers.
13:59:29 <liberate-your-te> <nscnt[m] "5G, yeah"> Thanks again. Any ETA on a beta release please anupritaisno1 ? Love to y'all

14:20:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> if anything i'll be doing unofficial builds for a while
14:21:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> there is no maintainer or anyone volunteering to help for these devices

14:36:17 <AndreLM> Hey guys... just joined. I recently bought a Pixel 4a, and installed GrapheneOS. Still waiting for the sim card, so actually not using it as a phone yet. However, I recorded a short video with the camera, and when I played it back, I heard some crackling noises from the top speaker. After searching for the issue, it seems that this affects some Pixel phones, but it was suposedly fixed by Google in December security patch. If this is software related,
14:36:19 <AndreLM> I suppose, it is affecting other GrapheneOS users. Anyone else with this issue?
14:44:49 <strcat> haven't heard of anyone with that issue
14:45:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> AndreLM: if it is a hardware issue and widely known then software can't fix it
14:45:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> maybe it can be worked around by disabling some feature
14:45:37 <strcat> it is probably a hardware defect resolved by RMA
14:46:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> but that is not something we do here, google has to fix hardware issues through some after sales service idk
14:48:18 <AndreLM> ok... thanks. But just to confirm... is this something that affects all Pixel (4) phones, or is it a random thing?
14:49:05 <AndreLM> I dont live in US, and brought the phone from an importer... so would need to negotiate the return with him
14:50:16 <AndreLM> I think I can still do it.... but if not, I was wondering if there is anything to mitigate? like disabling this top speaker...
14:50:36 <AndreLM> also, not sure if it affects phone calls (did not test it yet)
14:51:08 <strcat[m]> phone calls don't use the same mic as recording a video from the rear camera
14:51:43 <strcat> AndreLM: never heard of anyone here with that issue
14:51:55 <strcat> AndreLM: sounds like a hardware defect, probably impacts 1% of phones
14:52:11 <strcat> or less
14:52:42 <AndreLM> ok then... best is to flash the original firmware back and try to return it
14:52:54 <AndreLM> thanks guys. Appreciate the help
14:53:33 <strcat[m]> AndreLM: flash stock OS and test there
14:53:41 <strcat[m]> maybe they genuinely did do some software workaround
14:53:53 <strcat[m]> test in Google Camera and then try Open Camera (also try Open Camera on GrapheneOS 1st)
14:54:07 <strcat[m]> maybe they taught Google Camera to detect it and stop using the broken mic
14:54:23 <strcat[m]> I don't see how they could work around it other than that or some machine learning thing to filter it out
14:54:36 <strcat[m]> doubt they worked around it for other cameras
14:54:41 <strcat[m]> if at all
14:55:05 <AndreLM> issue is with the speaker... I found through a video recorded with Open camera, but it is also showing if I playback any music
14:56:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> AndreLM: yeah we can't fix that
14:57:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> need an rma

16:57:25 <liberate-your-te> <anupritaisno1[m] "and please just don't volunteer "> Thanks Anupritaisno1, we're actually a startup in the UK providing ready to go GrapheneOS Pixels and upgrading users existing. We hope to grow enough to fund you. Where should we look out for unofficial builds please? I am not a developer so cant help fix issues but more than happy to test in the real world and report. Much appreciated!
16:59:53 <faxing[m]> <blk "what carrier? It's working for m"> I'm on Mint as well
16:59:58 <faxing[m]> and no dice for me
17:00:30 <faxing[m]> Tried to get it working for months on my 3aXL on my own and eliciting the help of others and nothing
17:12:12 <blk> faxing[m]: what are you seeing on the voicemail page in the phone app?
17:12:50 <faxing[m]> I see a few visual voicemails (about five) from a long long time ago that I randomly got from my normal vm mailbox, but nothing before and nothing since
17:13:39 <blk> You can play their audio without dialing voicemail right?
17:13:42 <faxing[m]> I woke up one morning, there were five there that weren't the night before, and that's the only time I've ever gotten anything to my visual vm. Every other time including now, whenever I get a voicemail I get a notification that tells me to call my mailbox
17:14:05 <faxing[m]> <blk "You can play their audio without"> For the few that are in the visual vm page, yes
17:15:38 <faxing[m]> Also the time I got those few vms was I believe some time in early september
17:15:53 <faxing[m]> So nothing for a good while
17:17:48 <blk> So, I am testing this out more thoroughly for you. I just dialed myself from another device and left a voicemail.
17:18:30 <blk> On the recieveing device I got one notification for a missed call, and one for a voicemail. Pressing the voicemail notification takes me to the VVM interface and allows me to play the voicemail.
17:18:42 <blk> imo that behavior is VVM working correctly.
17:19:44 <blk> Previous to this release, the VVM interface indicated that it couldn't get visual voicemails. That indication is gone now.
17:20:02 <blk> again using Mint Mobile, WiFi calling, and VVM enabled
17:24:47 <faxing[m]> I had four different people from different phones call me this morning, all four times had me call the voicemail and nothing was in my visual vm
17:28:54 <faxing[m]>  * Thank you, I appreciate you trying to help.
17:28:54 <faxing[m]> I had four different people from different phones call me this morning, all four times had me call the voicemail and nothing was in my visual vm
17:56:52 <Yzordderrex[m]> The Dialer and Contacts apps seem unsupported, but disabling them and installing alternatives (Simple Contacts Pro) results in erratic behavior.
18:00:13 <Albakham[m]> that's because some other apps depends on those I think (someone confirm?)
18:00:13 <Albakham[m]> you can install other apps, but don't disable the base one
18:00:25 <Albakham[m]>  * that's because some android components depends on those I think (someone confirm?)
18:00:25 <Albakham[m]> you can install other apps, but don't disable the base one
18:00:46 <Yzordderrex[m]> For example, if I install Simple Contacts Pro and the Dialer app by the same developer (Tibor Kaputa) and then disable the stock Dialer and Contacts, random contacts start dissapearing!
18:01:36 <Albakham[m]> <Yzordderrex[m] "For example, if I install Simple"> don't do it then 😅
18:02:10 <Yzordderrex[m]> Yes, but one ends up with four apps, I mean if they are not supported, yet you can't get rid of them...
18:07:38 <Yzordderrex[m]> I guess I will just stick with the stock ones, even though they are showing their age and have become quite buggy. For example, "Block Unknown Numbers" does not work.
18:08:34 <Yzordderrex[m]> Neither does "Clear Call History" unless you force quit the Dialer.
18:18:54 <M2bfr33[m]> Have disabled stock ones without any issue and using just simple dialer and contacts

18:46:27 <kalbasit> nullnode[m]: will do, thank you.
18:46:56 <nullnode[m]> I'd always recommend for every apk you download, keep a copy in a folder along with the original checksum, good as a backup protocol or for future analysis if you have something go sideways
18:47:41 <kalbasit> nullnode[m]: do you usually pull apk's to your computer first and send them to your devices afterwards? Do you use adb to install them?
18:48:33 <nullnode[m]> <kalbasit "nullnode: do you usually pull ap"> personally yes, but in the past I have been a dummy and pulled direct and not verified

19:15:03 <nullnode[m]> yup, the toolchain still works, but before Linaro was doing full Kernel builds for AOSP on Pi's, probably would not work for what you're doing, but always good to see a working pipeline

20:24:49 <faxing[m]> when I click the notification it just calls the voicemail, doesn't open a vvm box or anything
20:39:14 <strcat[m]> b4dg: in the future, if you want more details, try a local verification to see if that works
20:39:32 <strcat[m]> it's difficult for the service to attribute a failed attestation to a specific device reliably so it currently doesn't try
20:39:43 <strcat[m]> in the future it could do that in a small subset of cases
20:40:16 <strcat[m]> also atm the client generally won't even try to send it to the server if it fails
20:40:24 <strcat[m]> since it knows it failed locally
20:40:51 <strcat[m]> in the threat model for it, there's not much point trying to send a failed one

21:41:10 <linux-party> https://ilinuxos.com
21:41:47 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> That link doesn't look correct
21:45:06 <earendil81> Hi, I am thinking of switching to pixel 4a + grapheneOS. As far as I have read, I understand that the main reason for the pixelX phones is the openTitan project. Am I correct? Furthermore, where can I read up on any hardware audits applied to pixel 4a?
21:46:38 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
21:46:51 <strcat> read those sections
21:48:44 <earendil81> I have. They do not explicitly state why these models were chosen. Just "high security standarts"
21:49:34 <strcat[m]> it says more than that
21:49:38 <earendil81> I mean: Has anybody undertaken the effort to check the Hardware of Pixel 4a for any sneaky business?
21:50:42 <strcat> yes, although I'm confused about why that is your focus and what exactly you expect to be done
21:50:52 <strcat> I recommend reading those sections on the site again if that's all you got from them
21:51:32 <strcat> there aren't many devices meeting our requirements
21:51:49 <earendil81> That I understand
21:51:50 <strcat> we don't have a broad set of devices to choose from and aren't yet in a position to be producing our own hardware with a hardware partner
21:52:11 <strcat> most devices do not have proper security updates
21:52:12 <earendil81> Yes, I am awaiting that point in time
21:52:23 <strcat> most devices don't support hardware-based security features with an alternate OS
21:52:34 <strcat> most devices don't have proper support for using an alternate OS even aside from that
21:52:53 <strcat> most devices don't have a secure element, particularly not one that's properly integrated with all of the APIs for that
21:53:21 <strcat> most devices have issues with their IOMMU configuration, etc. because the OEM does not actually care about security and doesn't do the security integration/testing work that they're responsible for handling
21:53:30 <TheJollyRoger> earendil81: in plain English, one of the reasons why Pixels are supported is because Google pays Qualcomm extra to allow us to rekey the bootloader. All other vendors (sometimes permanently) switch off or disable important security features if you don't run their operating system.
21:53:36 <strcat> most OEMs don't really have substantial internal security research teams
21:53:48 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I don't really think that's true
21:53:59 <strcat> I don't think vendors have to pay extra money to support that
21:54:14 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: oh, sorry.
21:54:32 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: but didn't some of the Google engineers mention via Twitter that they have to pay Qualcomm extra to allow the late stage bootloader to be rekeyable?
21:54:47 <strcat> who?
21:55:23 <strcat> also someone being a Google engineer doesn't mean they work on Android or Pixels
21:55:27 <strcat> or know about it
21:55:38 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see.
21:55:48 <strcat> I don't think vendors have to pay for anything extra to support that
21:55:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, crap, nevermind that then.
21:55:53 <strcat> they just don't care and don't implement it
21:56:00 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh >_<.
21:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> I see.
21:56:28 <strcat> some of them decide to allow unlocking and enable what's needed for that but that's it
21:56:38 <strcat> they don't actually put in the effort to make it possible to use another OS securely
21:56:47 <strcat> they don't test it or put together what's needed to do it
21:57:51 <strcat> earendil81: basically, if you look at our requirements and think there is even another device in existence providing them, let us know, because we'd be interested to know of a device meeting these requirements that's not a Pixel or a theoretical device we'd have to make with a hardware partner
21:58:14 <strcat> it is not so much that we choose these devices but that other devices are not available as options in the first place
21:58:40 <strcat> and these ones are not missing much other than us not being the OEM
21:58:55 <earendil81> Let me rephrase: It seemed unintuitive that google produced the most trusted device. But I have seen, that they undertook tremendous effort to thighten their security. Still you will have to forgive my weariness. Therefor the question, if someone has further checked the pixel models for implemented data sinks
21:59:14 <strcat> I mean, which vendor do you think would be more trustworthy then?
21:59:19 <strcat> I don't see what's unintuitive
21:59:38 <earendil81> good question
21:59:41 <strcat> it's not like we can use an iPhone, it clearly doesn't have official support for running an alternate OS, especially securely
21:59:53 <earendil81> yes, obviously
21:59:55 <TheJollyRoger> earendil81: There's a bug bounty on the Titan, actually.
21:59:59 <strcat> and I can't think of any other devices on the same level for security
22:00:12 <strcat> and I can't think of any non-Pixel that fully supports an alternate OS in a secure way
22:00:19 <strcat> not aware of any, no one has found any
22:00:48 <earendil81> no. you most probably are correct
22:00:49 <strcat> the devices always have fatal flaws
22:00:50 <TheJollyRoger> Last I had heard, Google put up a $1 million bet: if you can get a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence on the Titan M and produce a working proof of concept, the money's yours.
22:01:18 <strcat> earendil81: we ideally want to have a GrapheneOS device made with a hardware partner
22:01:28 <strcat> however, most companies are not actually interested in producing a secure device
22:01:31 <earendil81> I have read that.
22:01:36 <strcat> they want to make some shit tier device with GrapheneOS and coast on our brand
22:01:38 <strcat> which won't happen
22:01:51 <earendil81> no. that is very good
22:01:51 <strcat> we won't produce anything less than a device that's at least as secure as Pixels
22:01:53 <TheJollyRoger> If you're able to get it on developer preview builds, they'll increase the payout by 50%. so that's a lot of money, and a lot of incentive!
22:01:54 <strcat> which is a high standard
22:02:22 <earendil81> yes, and i admire your work
22:03:57 <earendil81> thank you and farewell
22:04:05 <strcat> what we need is more contributions to the project, and more good faith collaboration from companies, etc.
22:04:19 <strcat> we can certainly get a device made but it requires finding the right company to work with on it
22:04:21 <strcat> with aligned goals
22:04:32 <strcat> they have to actually want to make something good
22:04:43 <strcat> rather than just wanting to sell something and market/brand it as good
22:04:54 <strcat> i.e. not most companies or people in this industry
22:06:07 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows over about how other companies have peddled crap and marketed it so aggressively the bar has been set so low people are willing to settle for less so long as it has enough marketing.
22:12:59 <earendil81> Lately I have learned of many hardware projects perish due to production cost. Yet you have backing on a high level and might, in good time, achieve your aim. Do not forget that the product does not speak for itself. People speak for the product. And only when enough people have heard from the right people, can your project gain critical mass.
22:18:43 <saucy-salamander> What would be a more secure device than the Pixel? Or did you want to use open hardware?
22:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> Likely a good place to start would be a Qualcomm reference device.
22:19:22 <TheJollyRoger> Pixels are very close to those.
22:20:52 <TheJollyRoger> saucy-salamander: I would like someday for GrapheneOS to run on the Talos II or Blackbird, but that's at this moment a pipe dream since FlexVer and the LPCGuard is still at this moment not in production. Those are likely the closest you're going to get to open hardware at the present time short of going to the beach, scooping up a bucket of sand, and casting silicon yourself.
22:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> So even they don't meet the same security standards that Pixels do without it.
22:22:47 <TheJollyRoger> They also aren't the form factor you'd want either considering that the II is a large E-ATX dual socket workstation. The Blackbird is much better as a Mini-ATX but good luck getting that to fit in a pocket.
22:24:42 <saucy-salamander> I have some reading to do haha. Yeah I was about to say, am I looking at the correct hardware cause seems large for a phone
22:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> A little - fully loaded, the Morgan's Revenge (my Talos) weighs more than 50 pounds.
22:27:32 <saucy-salamander> Correct me if I'm wrong but the end goal for GrapheneOS is to not use Linux and run a hypervisor instead?  So like QubesOS?
22:28:27 <TheJollyRoger> That I'm not sure on at the moment; only that right now, the large attack surface of the Linux Kernel is something that seems to be really holding the project back in terms of mitigating or preventing exploits.
22:28:51 <saucy-salamander> <TheJollyRoger "A little - fully loaded, the Mor"> What do you run on it, Linux I assume?
22:29:02 <saucy-salamander> <TheJollyRoger "That I'm not sure on at the mome"> Fair enough
22:29:08 <TheJollyRoger> So if the project does want to continue going down that area, sooner or later, it will eventually need to move away from the Linux Kernel.
22:29:19 <TheJollyRoger> *going down that path,
22:29:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, just very bog-standard Linux.
22:30:32 <TheJollyRoger> I need to run for a bit though, so I'll be off for a bit.
22:31:20 <justanotherlurke> Talking about devices - is there any reason grapheneos could not also in principle power a tablet (assuming the hardware meets the requirements)?
22:32:18 <Kurai> justanotherlurke: there isn’t
22:32:43 <TheJollyRoger> Just going to rush back for a second to answer:
22:33:06 <saucy-salamander> <TheJollyRoger "I need to run for a bit though, "> Thanks for the info mate, have a good one
22:34:21 <TheJollyRoger> justanotherlurke: It depends. If there are enough people to maintain it, then possibly. There's also nobody stopping anybody from porting it to another device, and I'll let you in on a little secret: GrapheneOS actually will compile for and run on devices it doesn't officially support depending on what compile time options you set. It's software and is actually fairly portable.
22:35:25 <TheJollyRoger> If some vendor came out of the woodwork and offered a Qualcomm reference device with the security chip and everything and full attentiveness to third-party verified boot keying, it would be doable if the project has a maintainer available. Unfortunately, Android Tablets have kind of lapsed over the years, and with that, so has decent hardware for them.
22:35:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, now I gotta go - arr saucy-salamander, fare thee well!
22:39:36 <justanotherlurke> <TheJollyRoger "justanotherlurker: It depends. I"> Thanks for your reply. I was thinking of a secure  gos-tablet, like the pixel smartphones. Or even laptop?  Aware there are probably no suitable devices right now that meet the requirements (not to mention maintainers). Who knows, might be worth giving some more thought to.
23:47:17 <FreeWillie> I have a simple question : does this make sense? use shelter on graphenOS to sandbox google play store and services. This would allow you to use google nav and android auto in a sandbox right?
