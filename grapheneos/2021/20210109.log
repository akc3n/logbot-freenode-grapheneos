01:19:18 <narcoli[m]> Question: I know best practice is to get a sim not attached to your name but if you put your regular phone sim they only way they can track track you if you are using graphene is through triangulatiuon correct?

01:30:40 <akko> anthraxx: do you use graphene os on your main device?
01:58:34 <sam6781> Hello everyone
01:59:04 <Baobab> salute
01:59:33 <sam6781> I tried installing GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a via Debian Buster...
01:59:53 <narcoli[m]> <akko "anthraxx: do you use graphene os"> no but id like too
02:00:12 <sam6781> I followed the guide exactly and I coudn't get to install
02:01:08 <sam6781> So I managed to get access to Windows 10 so I'm going to try to install again
02:01:55 <sam6781> My booloader is still unlocked from the previous attempt at the install
02:02:16 <akko> narcoli[m]: are you polyak?
02:02:33 <narcoli[m]> what?
02:02:50 <narcoli[m]> as in polish?
02:03:19 <akko> polyak is anthrax, I asked him :/
02:03:54 <sam6781> When I connect the phone to Windows 10 and run fastboot flashing unlock it says < waiting for any device >
02:05:11 <narcoli[m]> <akko "polyak is anthrax, I asked him :"> Im not sure what this means so probably not.
02:06:48 <akko> narcoli[m]: I asked anthraxx (polyak) if he used it, and you replied, what made me think you were him
02:07:00 <narcoli[m]> oh gotcha
02:09:53 <sam6781> When I connect the phone to Windows 10 and run fastboot flashing unlock it says < waiting for any device >. This is the same message that I got after trying to flash the first time. Any idea how to fix this?
02:14:22 <sam6781> How can I restore my phone like it was prior to attempted flash? If not able to install GrapheneOS it would be nice to be able to use my phone.
02:19:24 <sam6781> Anyone?
02:19:48 <mulbr[m]> Just be patient, someone can help get it flashed.
02:19:58 <narcoli[m]> <sam6781 "When I connect the phone to Wind"> I had the same issue
02:20:01 <narcoli[m]> but on ubuntu
02:20:09 <narcoli[m]> I changed wire and it worked
02:20:20 <sam6781> I tried Debian and Windows so far
02:20:27 <narcoli[m]> on your screen it has to show usb debugging
02:20:58 <sam6781> I'm using the cable that came with the phone
02:21:51 <sam6781> Do I have to install USB drivers?
02:22:02 <narcoli[m]> I wiped a laptop I had I installed this https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
02:22:17 <narcoli[m]> <sam6781 "Do I have to install USB drivers"> i didnt no
02:22:43 <sam6781> the phone is showing in the device manager
02:22:56 <narcoli[m]> Just a fresh install of ubunu and a usb that read my phone
02:22:59 <sam6781> I'm not sure if that matters
02:23:12 <narcoli[m]> <sam6781 "the phone is showing in the devi"> I woudnt know
02:25:40 <mulbr[m]> Sometimes USB c to regular USB cables are better, could try a diff slot on computer too
02:25:48 <narcoli[m]> you also have to get this before hand https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
02:26:25 <Birdie[m]> <sam6781 "I'm not sure if that matters"> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
02:26:29 <narcoli[m]> my main problem was waiting for any device I changed usb and it worked
02:28:33 <Birdie[m]> <sam6781 "the phone is showing in the devi"> You have to set the path in the terminal session in order for it to work..otherwise you will have the issue you are having right now..
02:29:06 <sam6781> when I run fastboot --version
02:29:28 <sam6781> It shows fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
02:29:43 <sam6781> I do believe I did the step correctly
02:29:48 <narcoli[m]> thats good
02:29:54 <Birdie[m]> "The flashing process won't work unless you follow these instructions including setting up PATH." And you must then use that same terminal window for the rest of the steps.
02:30:47 <sam6781> I'm using the same Power Shell

02:34:00 <sam6781> Installed as C:\Users\sam\Desktop\Downloads\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
02:34:44 <Birdie[m]> And you did
02:34:45 <Birdie[m]>  $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
02:35:39 <sam6781> Yes
02:39:54 <sam6781> This is the 2nd attempt at flashing the device. The first time I used Debian and it ended with the  < waiting for any device >
02:40:32 <Birdie[m]> And you've had a pop up on phone to allow trust of device when you first did it?
02:42:03 <Birdie[m]> Maybe it is just the cable. Like narcoli mentioned.
02:42:03 <Birdie[m]> I've had that issue before and swapping cables solved it..
02:42:03 <Birdie[m]> I mean since you tried it both on deb and windows.
02:44:05 <sam6781> I just watched a video and they say that you should enable usb debugging. I didn't do this step. Could this also be thre problem? Is it possible to get back to those settings?
02:46:18 <Birdie[m]> That is the problme lol
02:46:31 <Birdie[m]> Just read the install guide slowly and carefully
02:46:52 <sam6781> How can I get back to those settings? Did I destroy my new phone lol
02:47:05 <Birdie[m]> * That is the problem lol
02:47:08 <narcoli[m]> you have to tap 7 times in the phone model enable developer mode then enable  OEM Unlocking and USB Debugging.
02:47:33 <Birdie[m]> What's on your screen right now on the phone
02:48:10 <Birdie[m]> Are you able to boot up in to android
02:49:04 <sam6781> It has a red exclamation mark in a red triangle
02:49:23 <sam6781> And it says device state unlocked
02:49:29 <sam6781> boot slot b
02:49:42 <sam6781> Enter reason reboot bootloader
02:53:08 <sam6781> if i hit the volume button I get a few options 1. start 2. restart bootloader 3. recovery mode 4. rescue mode 5. barcode 6. power off
02:54:06 <sam6781> Under the black exclamation mark inside a red triangle it says fastboot mode
02:55:48 <Birdie[m]> 1. Start
02:55:48 <Birdie[m]> Then enable developer mode from settings like narcoli said
02:57:23 <sam6781> When I click start it just brings me back to the fastboot screen
02:58:47 <Birdie[m]> sam6781:  after enabling developer options, go into developer options menu and scroll down to USB debugging and enable that and OEM unlocking
02:58:48 <Birdie[m]> Plug the cable back into phone and into computer
02:59:22 <Birdie[m]> Turn the phone off and power it back on normally
02:59:27 <sam6781> I'm not able to leave the Fastboot Mode screen
03:00:18 <narcoli[m]> if you move your volume buttons up and down you can
03:01:19 <Birdie[m]> Turn off the phone by holding the power button, unplug usb. And then just  power it back up by only pressing the power button. Or use up/down vol keys to select start
03:02:48 <sam6781> Unfortunately it just goes stright to the Fastboot Mode screen
03:04:23 <sam6781> When I try the rescue and recovery mode it reboots and I can see the Google screen but than it takes me to a screen that says no command
03:04:52 <narcoli[m]> when you are in fastboot mode on the top right you can move with the volume buttons to say start right?
03:06:08 <sam6781> Yes. when I clck the start button my screen goes black for a second and then the fastboot screen appears again
03:06:48 <narcoli[m]> oh
03:07:02 <narcoli[m]> its supposed to go back in google mode
03:07:51 <sam6781> I did this by following the official instructions. Copy and paste lol
03:08:30 <sam6781> I wonder why they don't tell you to enable usb debbuging
03:09:56 <narcoli[m]> How do I fix stuck on fastboot mode?
03:09:56 <narcoli[m]> Simply turn off your device and then turn it back on. Use The Key Trick: You can use the hardware keys of your device to fix Android stuck on fastboot mode. Here what you need to do it – press and hold the Power button for 15 seconds, your device will vibrate once and reboot.
03:10:14 <narcoli[m]> https://www.recoverandroid-data.com/fixed-android-stuck-in-fastboot-mode
03:10:38 <narcoli[m]> maybe this can help?
03:10:40 <Birdie[m]> <sam6781 "I wonder why they don't tell you"> Ya they do...

03:11:05 <thistroll> https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking
03:12:00 <sam6781> I did that step
03:12:36 <narcoli[m]> have you tried getting back into google mode?
03:14:42 <sam6781> Im going through that link you sent me now. The first option didnt work
03:15:00 <narcoli[m]> which phone do you have?
03:15:45 <sam6781> the pixel 4a
03:15:54 <sam6781> It says its supported
03:16:04 <narcoli[m]> I used the same one
03:16:16 <narcoli[m]> I was able to get out of boot mode
03:16:35 <narcoli[m]> was there anything that you did prior?
03:16:39 <narcoli[m]> with windows?
03:17:11 <sam6781> I tried to flash it on linux
03:17:22 <Birdie[m]> Did you hold down the power button for 15+ seconds
03:17:31 <sam6781> This is the first time trying to flash on windows
03:17:39 <narcoli[m]> flashing it is at the end
03:18:31 <sam6781> Holding the power button didn't work it just flashes and brings me back to the flashboot screen

03:21:00 <Birdie[m]> Okay and using the volume keys on the side of the phone to select start then pushing the power buttons once quickly to engage 1. Start doesn't work?
03:23:00 <sam6781> It doesnt work
03:30:49 <narcoli[m]> what exactly did you flash?
03:32:31 <sam6781> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
03:32:41 <Birdie[m]> <narcoli[m] "what exactly did you flash?"> It would be nice to know what steps he did on deb or windows prior to all this and now him being back on windows..
03:33:09 <Birdie[m]> <sam6781 "curl -O https://releases.graphen"> That just downloads the ROM to your computer hard drive
03:33:22 <sam6781> I followed all the instructions on the official install page for linux
03:33:34 <sam6781> I didn't leave out any steps
03:33:51 <narcoli[m]> <Birdie[m] "It would be nice to know what st"> its true how are back on windows if you used linux?
03:34:10 <sam6781> When I tried to flash it said waiting on device
03:34:25 <Birdie[m]> <sam6781 "I didn't leave out any steps"> But what step did you stop at for the Linux instructions that made you go back to windows
03:34:44 <sam6781> I coudn't get it to work on Linux so I thought windows would work
03:34:46 <narcoli[m]> <sam6781 "When I tried to flash it said wa"> on windows or linux?
03:35:09 <sam6781> Linux
03:35:48 <narcoli[m]> ok and on linux it said waiting for device but you never enabled usb debugging? and you flashed it anyway
03:35:58 <narcoli[m]> im confused with what you did
03:36:12 <Birdie[m]> <sam6781 "When I tried to flash it said wa"> So when you tried to flash it on linux before going back to windows...
03:36:36 <sam6781> I did this step: https://grapheneos.org/install#enabling-oem-unlocking
03:36:51 <Birdie[m]> <narcoli[m] "im confused with what you did"> Ya me too...
03:36:54 <narcoli[m]> if it said waiting for any device how were you able to unlock bootloader?
03:37:06 <sam6781> But according to the video the usb debugging is a seperate option that I should have enabled
03:38:00 <sam6781> It said that after I tried to flash
03:38:03 <Birdie[m]> OK so on deb you made it to oem unlocking but couldn't complete it because it said waiting for device..
03:38:03 <Birdie[m]> And you enabled developer options but didn't enable USB debugging.
03:38:03 <Birdie[m]> So you went back to windows is that correct
03:38:05 <narcoli[m]> without usb debugging you cant unlock the bootloader therefore you cant flash anything. Am I missing something Birdie
03:39:13 <Birdie[m]> You couldn't have flashed anything
03:39:23 <narcoli[m]> right
03:39:30 <sam6781> https://youtu.be/gQkb0OAOXoc?t=278
03:40:07 <sam6781> OEM unlocking and usb debugging are two seperate options
03:40:16 <sam6781> I did the the oen unlocking
03:40:25 <narcoli[m]> yes they are
03:40:28 <sam6781> oem*
03:40:58 <narcoli[m]> you need to enable both to unlock your phone with bootloader to flash it
03:41:34 <sam6781> I guess thats why it didnt flash
03:41:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> sam6781: we don't support installation videos
03:41:48 <sam6781> Hopefully my phone is not garbage now
03:41:55 <sam6781> I paid 600 for it lol
03:42:12 <Birdie[m]> Did you ever at any time time by any chance close the terminal either in deb or windows after setting the path for fastboot and then tried to do it again from a new terminal
03:42:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> sam6781: that video is wrong
03:42:28 <Birdie[m]> So wrong
03:42:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are not going to get support for this unofficial nonsense
03:42:59 <sam6781> I didnt follow the video originally. I just followed the official guide for linux

03:43:39 <sam6781> I followed the guide
03:45:38 <Birdie[m]> Ya but you didn't enable USB debugging which is on the prerequisites on install guide if you click "full update package page" the very last link in prerequisites .. It mentions USB debugging
03:46:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Birdie: we do?
03:46:23 <sam6781> i guess I screwed up
03:46:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> It seems you are confused
03:46:35 <sam6781> Very

03:46:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> ```
03:46:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> You do not need to have adb enabled within the OS or the host's ADB key whitelisted within the OS to sideload an update to recovery. Recovery mode does not trust the attached computer and this can be considered a production feature.

04:12:05 <sam6781> I'm not sure what happened. I followed the instructions...
04:12:27 <narcoli[m]> Im still not sure how you flashed anything onto your phone with the waiting for any device
04:12:54 <sam6781> I dont think it flashed
04:13:03 <elmyder[m]> yeah from the sound of it nothing is flashed
04:13:12 <narcoli[m]> ok so that means you still have google software
04:13:22 <narcoli[m]> you should be able to get back in
04:13:33 <elmyder[m]> yeah you should still have the original os
04:15:01 <deappledapple> <sam6781 "its the 4a"> Did it say "product:sunfish" in bootloader?
04:15:43 <narcoli[m]> at the bottom

04:19:40 <deappledapple> Try plugging the usb somewhere else

04:50:43 <deappledapple> Try to reboot to recovery, do factory reset, then sideload the stock OTA
04:50:55 <deappledapple> Then flash again the GrapheneOS factory image
04:54:42 <sam6781> When I reboot to recovery it takes me to a black screen that shows the android robot on its back with a black exclamation mark inside a red triangle. Below the image it says no command
04:57:18 <take_a_deep_brea> wait it should take you to recovery
04:57:58 <take_a_deep_brea> did it , or the screen still shows the green bot?
05:00:02 <sam6781> It shows the green bot
05:01:24 <take_a_deep_brea> then press power and vol down
05:04:25 <take_a_deep_brea> ok dont do that
05:06:35 <take_a_deep_brea> power + vol up
05:09:41 <sam6781> It still shows the green bot
05:11:36 <take_a_deep_brea> hmmm.
05:12:38 <take_a_deep_brea> wait a minute .
05:13:56 <take_a_deep_brea> try hoolding power button and just tap the vol up once
05:14:13 <take_a_deep_brea> hold vol up momentarily while pressing power
05:16:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> sam6781: what are you doing
05:18:03 <take_a_deep_brea> his flash failed
05:18:38 <take_a_deep_brea> idk how rebooting to recovery would help him
05:19:52 <sam6781> When I hold power and tap the volume up it brings up a new menu
05:20:17 <sam6781> it says wipe data/factory reset
05:20:24 <sam6781> Do I select this option?
05:22:42 <take_a_deep_brea> well wait a second. so your flash failed , right ? did you update the stock before flsahing?
05:23:01 <take_a_deep_brea> <deappledapple "Try to reboot to recovery, do fa"> as i see here it is suggested
05:23:15 <sam6781> I downloaded all the security updates. Is that what you mean?
05:24:19 <take_a_deep_brea> actually stock update also updates the firmware . thats what we need from that update :up to date firmware .
05:26:33 <sam6781> I also see an option that says apply update from ADB
05:30:42 <take_a_deep_brea> sam6781: you cant as you dont have a working image at this point .
05:31:12 <take_a_deep_brea> a full factory image is what we need and is what is recommended here https://developers.google.com/android/images
05:32:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> take_a_deep_breath: restart the flash
05:32:49 <take_a_deep_brea> theyve done that already once .

06:13:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> sam47: pm me
06:16:51 <sam47> how do I reinstall the origional OS?
06:18:58 <louipc> sam47: https://flash.android.com/back-to-public
06:28:47 <sam47> I guess I will tackle this again tomorrow. I have no idea why its so difficult to get this working...
06:31:16 <take_a_deep_brea> sure . sam47:  do you have any other OS available for flashing from?
06:31:53 <sam47> only Windows 10
06:32:17 <deappledapple> Should be easier to get it done there (assuming good quality cables and usb ports)
06:32:47 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
06:33:23 <sam47> what do I use to verify the downloaded files?
06:33:48 <take_a_deep_brea> sam47:  verifying the files is more of an addon .
06:34:04 <take_a_deep_brea> sam47: you can always verify the installation with auditor
06:34:45 <take_a_deep_brea> the connection made is https and we trust the grapheneOS servers anyway
06:34:53 <take_a_deep_brea> for the flashing instructions
06:37:48 <sam47> When I run fastboot flashing unlock it says <waiting for any device>
06:38:04 <take_a_deep_brea> on windows?
06:38:11 <sam47> Yes
06:38:24 <sam47> On Linux it said it was already unlocked
06:38:25 <take_a_deep_brea> you have to update the drivers mostly
06:38:55 <sam47> Whats the best way to do that?
06:39:11 <sam47> Do I just update the usb drivers?
06:39:26 <take_a_deep_brea> is your system up to date
06:39:46 <sam47> Yes
06:40:09 <sam47> the phone is listed in the device manager other devices
06:40:25 <sam47> *under other devices
06:41:07 <sam47> The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)There are no compatible drivers for this device.To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.
06:41:08 <take_a_deep_brea> wait a minute
06:42:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> I told you to pm
06:42:48 <take_a_deep_brea> anupritaisno1:  they are trying on Win10
06:42:58 <take_a_deep_brea> i think thats better , right >
06:43:02 <take_a_deep_brea> *?
06:43:57 <sam47> I did pm
06:51:08 <take_a_deep_brea> anupritaisno1: does windows need some specific driver installation for recognizing device in fastboot?
06:52:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only if for some reason windows update couldn't fetch it
06:52:29 <take_a_deep_brea> hmmm
06:52:56 <take_a_deep_brea> sam47:  had that issue , i think
06:53:12 <take_a_deep_brea> ok they shouldve done that though
06:54:06 <take_a_deep_brea> Update Drive
06:54:10 <take_a_deep_brea> *r
07:21:14 <Guest69311> I downloaded sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip in Windows 10. i was just wondering how I can verify the files before I install them...
07:22:15 <take_a_deep_brea> you dont need in most cases
07:22:22 <take_a_deep_brea>  * you dont need to in most cases
07:22:49 <Guest69311> i always try to verify
07:23:02 <Guest69311> A little paranoid I guess lol
07:23:25 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311:  the connection is encrypted and the download is from trusted servers
07:23:52 <take_a_deep_brea> the images are signed with the Signify program which has not been ported to windows , i think
07:26:36 <take_a_deep_brea> no its not available for windows
07:27:29 <louipc> man they need a new name. hard to find on search engine
07:27:31 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311:  you can always verify your installlation with auditor and that should suffice .
07:27:55 <take_a_deep_brea> <louipc "man they need a new name. hard t"> whats this about ?
07:28:01 <louipc> i'll call it 'bsd signify' or something
07:28:06 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
07:28:59 <louipc> take_a_deep_brea: bsd signify tool
07:29:14 <take_a_deep_brea> gotcha
07:29:31 <louipc> searching web for 'signify' is not helpufl lol
07:30:14 <take_a_deep_brea> louipc: and yeah , whats it with peoples nicks ? many of them are guest<number> , user<number>
07:30:21 <take_a_deep_brea> might as well get a UUID
07:31:03 <louipc> guests are from freenode web chat. they didnt bother setting a nick
07:31:54 <theOne[m]> I get crackling sounds from the top front speaker when I tap  the phone
07:31:58 <take_a_deep_brea> okay , that explains a lot
07:32:04 <theOne[m]> Anyone having that issue?
07:33:54 <theOne[m]> To be specific, its when I'm on a video call
07:34:24 <take_a_deep_brea> i think there is only one speaker
07:36:05 <take_a_deep_brea> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7157629?hl=en
07:36:21 <theOne[m]> I'm not on a pixel 5, its a 3XL

07:38:40 <theOne[m]> All good. Its only happened since the beta. Just checking who else
07:39:10 <mrxx_0[m]> take_a_deep_breath 4a has 2 speakers, like all pixel since the 2 I think. For stereo
07:39:42 <take_a_deep_brea> one sec
07:40:21 <take_a_deep_brea> yes it has two .
07:48:48 <Guest69311> I had to install the Google USB Driver in order for windows to recognize my device
07:51:18 <take_a_deep_brea> good
07:51:26 <take_a_deep_brea> are you the one who came before?
07:51:38 <Guest69311> Yes lol
07:51:50 <Guest69311> Getting closer I think
07:52:43 <take_a_deep_brea> ok
07:52:50 <take_a_deep_brea> its a bit confusing
07:53:00 <Guest69311> Very'
08:15:22 <Guest69311> After I flash it says your device is loading a different operating system. The google screen comes and then it goes back to fastboot mode. Why is it doing this?
08:16:02 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311: it is supposed to do that
08:17:03 <Guest69311> so how do I disable the fastboot mode window?
08:17:35 <Guest69311> Clicking start doesnt work
08:17:57 <take_a_deep_brea> > Jibbler30: that's how it will be on any device not specifically made to run GrapheneOS
08:17:57 <take_a_deep_brea> > Jibbler30: that's what you want
08:18:10 <take_a_deep_brea> > means verified boot is enabled and it's using our verified boot key flashed as part of installation
08:18:33 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311: did you lock the bootloader
08:18:46 <Guest69311> I locked the bootloader
08:20:38 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311: just press the power button
08:21:27 <Guest69311> It just brings me back to the fastboot mode
08:23:00 <take_a_deep_brea> <Guest69311 "After I flash it says your devic"> Guest69311: if you have got the screen for loading diff. OS then the flash was successful. did the flash-all end with any error or failure ?
08:23:13 <take_a_deep_brea> on  the terminal?
08:25:00 <Guest69311> i just see this error: Sending sparse 'system_b' 2/4 (262140 KB)          FAILED (Error reading sparse file)fastboot: error: Command failed
08:28:11 <take_a_deep_brea> ok then it has not finished yet .
08:33:25 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311: are you using the usb-c cord that came with thedevice?
08:34:38 <anonhat[m]> Your device will reboot several times throughout the install process. Just let it do its thing until you no longer see any activity on the screen. If you screwed up the install by interfering with the device before the install was finished, restart the fastboot process.
08:35:54 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311: i think what anonhat  says is correct . somehow your installation got interrupted because of some disturbance in the connection.
08:37:04 <anonhat[m]> Yes, it's also possible that the cable is borked. If so, try again. If it persists, try another cable.
08:37:58 <clox[m]> Hi guys,
08:37:58 <clox[m]> I notice you have a pixel phone 4a 4G and a 4a 5G. Which one is suitable for grapheneOS?
08:38:34 <Guest69311> i got it finally lol
08:38:43 <Guest69311> It only took three days lol
08:38:48 <Guest69311> Victory!
08:39:16 <louipc> nice
08:45:35 <louipc> clox[m]: the normal pixel 4a is suitable for grapheneos
08:45:43 <louipc> not the 4a 5G
08:48:21 <take_a_deep_brea> Guest69311: great! what did you do ?
08:49:01 <clox[m]> <louipc "clox: the normal pixel 4a is sui"> Thank you louipc
08:53:08 <stencil[m]> Hey, is there any plan to use deep speech for stt and tts?
08:53:59 <Guest69311> thanks for all the help
13:23:02 <theOne[m]> What kind of encryption is this in this link? Every website I look at from vanadium had that encrypted text in the link address. It's concerning...
13:23:03 <theOne[m]>  https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/covid-safe-check-in#eyJ0IjoiY292aWQxOV9idXNpbmVzcyIsImJpZCI6IjQ4NDQ4IiwiYm5hbWUiOiJCQlEgU2VvdWwgIiwiYmFkZHJlc3MiOiI1MiBNb3NlbHkgU3RyZWV0LCBTdHJhdGhmaWVsZCBOU1csIEF1c3RyYWxpYSJ9
13:36:00 <nscnt[m]> I would like to delete the URL, but I can't. Guys: Just don't click on it, even if it might not be malicious. A random guy posting a link and you clicking on it is not a good way to operate online
13:42:34 <louipcm> theOne:  yea and thats offtopic
13:42:38 <louipcm> i'll delete it
13:43:51 <theOne[m]> Its happening in grapheneos
13:44:05 <theOne[m]> And I've passed the verification from auditor
13:44:31 <theOne[m]> From what you're saying its enough confirmation for me to wipe the os.
13:44:34 <theOne[m]> Thanks
13:44:59 <louipcm> hmm i dunno australia has some anti encryption laws though
13:45:14 <louipcm> you might wann investigate further
13:45:55 <louipcm> anyway offtopic is a better channel to discuss that
13:46:18 <theOne[m]> All good, thanks for answering me
13:46:28 <louipcm> theOne:  #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
13:46:47 <louipcm> we can discuss/investigate there please
13:47:13 <theOne[m]> Its fine
13:47:41 <theOne[m]> I intend to remove it as it doesn't seem right. Its happening to all sites from my browser
13:47:54 <louipcm> weird
13:48:18 <theOne[m]> Yes. Ive passed local and remote authentication
13:48:38 <theOne[m]> That's why I believed in topic would've been appropriate
13:49:15 <theOne[m]> And if its weird, it doesn't sound like its common for anyone else
15:00:07 <Dude4638457> I installed Graphene OS a couple of days ago. I also installed F-Droid and Aurora. Now F-Droid does not show any apps and Aurora says something is wrong with the API. How can I repair this?
15:04:20 <Pratyush[m]> <Dude4638457 "I installed Graphene OS a couple"> Clear data ->  Settings -> Network -> enable customize token
15:05:15 <Dude4638457> Actually, F-Droid is saying that now apps are installed (via F-Droid) which is not true. I installed some a while ago. It says I should update the repositories, but I don't know how to do that.
15:06:39 <Dude4638457> Pratyush[m]: Where do I do that? Where do I find "Clear data"?
15:08:15 <Pratyush[m]> <Dude4638457 "Pratyush: Where do I do that? Wh"> Settings -> Apps and notification -> see all -> select aurora store and click it -> storage and cache -> clear data
15:08:33 <Pratyush[m]> Clear data or clear storage
15:09:19 <Pratyush[m]> <Dude4638457 "Actually, F-Droid is saying that"> Clarify it a bit more.
15:09:26 <Dude4638457> Pratyush[m]: My phone has a different language. It is not "Empty Cache" right?
15:10:14 <Pratyush[m]> This is not required to do, you can follow the step to enable token and it will work just fine
15:10:15 <Dude4638457> it is the other one within the "storage and cache" of aurora, right?
15:10:37 <Pratyush[m]> <Dude4638457 "Pratyush: My phone has a differe"> yes
15:10:51 <Pratyush[m]> <Dude4638457 "it is the other one within the ""> yes
15:12:33 <Dude4638457> Pratyush[m]: I did it for Aurora. I am trying to say that I want to use an Anonymized account, but Aurora does not proceed.
15:13:21 <Pratyush[m]> <Dude4638457 "Pratyush: I did it for Aurora. I"> > <@freenode_Dude4638457:matrix.org> I installed Graphene OS a couple of days ago. I also installed F-Droid and Aurora. Now F-Droid does not show any apps and Aurora says something is wrong with the API. How can I repair this?
15:14:05 <Pratyush[m]> Sorry my bad,
15:14:05 <Pratyush[m]> Clear data ->  Settings -> Network -> enable customize token
15:14:19 <Pratyush[m]> Sorry again, i just copied and modified it a bjt
15:15:49 <Dude4638457> Pratyush[m]: I don't understand what you mean. First: I did delete all the app data of Aurora in "Settings -> Apps and notification -> see all -> select aurora store and click it -> storage and cache -> clear data"
15:15:52 <Dude4638457> now what?
15:16:03 <Dude4638457> I don't know where the "Clear data" is
15:16:21 <Dude4638457> I mean: I do not know what other "Clear data" you mean than the one I already deleted.
15:18:22 <Pratyush[m]> As you already cleared the data of aurora store just enable random token option form auroa store app settings
15:18:23 <mynacol> Dude4638457: Clear data ->  Open Aurora -> Settings -> Network -> enable customize token
15:19:14 <Pratyush[m]> Settings -> Network -> enable customize token
15:20:40 <Dude4638457> Do you guys mean that within the auora app?
15:21:14 <Dude4638457> precentor[m]: I did that. I stil get "Failed to build API"
15:21:52 <Dude4638457> ah... now it works for some reason
15:22:55 <Dude4638457> ok, now I also deleted the data of F-Droid and it works as well now
15:22:58 <Dude4638457> thank you!
15:23:04 <Dude4638457> any idea what the problem was?
16:07:02 <nscnt[m]> Dude4638457: None of GrapheneOS. Ask the app developers if you want to know.
16:13:54 <deappledapple> Suggesting to try more modern F-droid clients
16:14:29 <deappledapple> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Checking_apps_installed_on_device
16:16:53 <TheDude12345> I am trying to use MyPhoneExplorer on Graphene OS. When I tell it to use fix IP and try to connect via WiFi it tells me that the connection could not be established because of a SocketError 10061 - Connection is forcefully rejected. How can I enable Graphene OS to accept this?
16:20:31 <deappledapple> Unsure why would you need an app to connect to WiFi
16:20:36 <deappledapple> Isn't system settings enough?
16:20:40 <TheDude12345> I AM able to "ping" my phone
16:21:23 <TheDude12345> deappledapple: I don't understand the question. Isn't it pretty normal that a phone is connected to WiFi?
16:21:55 <deappledapple> Yeah
16:22:21 <deappledapple> I mean I find it weird that you need a user app to connect to WiFi
16:22:23 <nscnt[m]> We don't give support for applications that are not part of GrapheneOS here.
16:22:55 <deappledapple> Can't really offer support for something unfamilar here, unfortunately
16:24:15 <deappledapple> Oh, you can try in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org if somebody knows that app. No guarantees that somebody else exists s
16:25:13 <take_a_deep_brea> TheDude12345: you are free to tinker with some settings and see how it works for you. But to have system level support for a particular app not bundled with the OS  is pretty much not possible in any custom ROM leave alone grapheneOS .we can try and help you with any user facing errors , though.
16:26:12 <take_a_deep_brea> cant do nothing about SocketError unless it has some user facing configuration
16:59:07 <TheDude12345> nscnt[m]: reason I was asking here was because it might be that Graphene OS is blocking this.
16:59:24 <TheDude12345> https://help.globalscape.com/help/archive/cuteftp6/socket_error_=__10061.htm says that "10061 is a Connection Refused error sent to you by the server. You could not make a connection because the target machine actively refused it. The most common cause is a misconfigured server, full server, or incorrect Port specified by the client."
16:59:53 <TheDude12345> so I was thinking that Graphene OS is maybe rejecting s.th. coming from a specific port
17:01:14 <deappledapple> Have you tried getting a logcat
17:01:58 <TheDude12345> ah, it works now
17:02:17 <TheDude12345> I needed to
17:02:19 <TheDude12345> $ sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 1714:1764 -j ACCEPT
17:02:23 <TheDude12345> $ sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1714:1764 -j ACCEPT
17:02:32 <TheDude12345> and restart the app on the computer
17:04:30 <deappledapple> Oh, that was on your computer then? Guess that's nice you had that fixed
17:09:48 <m47rx[m]> Hi, I´d like to try grapheneOS (first time user) Can anybody tell me if the ESIM feature of the Pixel 4a is supported by the OS? Didnt find it info in the documentation about it.
17:11:05 <take_a_deep_brea> m47rx: esim is supported by the OS but the user facing apps by carriers arent
17:11:38 <take_a_deep_brea> one method that has worked is configuring esim on stock and then flashing grapheneOS
17:12:56 <m47rx[m]> Not sure if I need an App for that, but will try as recommended. the esim Info should be in a kind of memory that is not flashed, correct?
17:14:28 <m47rx[m]> Anyway, thanx for the help 👍️
17:19:07 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
17:26:12 <dubbz> Anyone have insight on to install platform tools on ubuntu? It appears Package bsdtar is not available. Replace with libarchive-tools?
17:33:11 <deappledapple> <dubbz "Anyone have insight on to instal"> use unzip as alternative I guess?
17:34:35 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah . shouldnt be an issue using unzip
17:41:29 <m47rx[m]> take_Again with the esim feature: Where I live you get a QR Code from the provider to scan and then your QR Code Scanning App generates a weblink and connects via the installed mobile browser to the provider website to download your esim profile. So on F-Droid there are QR-Code apps as well -  I would guess that way should work? Also: Are both esim and a second physical sim slot supported working at the same time (dual
17:41:29 <m47rx[m]> sim?) or are there restrictions? Thanx in advance!
17:54:03 <Duj2> Hey everyone, I'm trying to install GrapheneOS for the first time on a new Pixel 4a using Arch Linux but I'm stuck on flashing the factory images. Executing flash-all.sh simply does nothing, no error output, it's just stuck. I think I strictly followed the installation guide and don't know what I'm missing here, so any help would be appreciated :)
17:56:36 <take_a_deep_brea> m47rx: i think they are both supported together esim and sim .
17:56:37 <take_a_deep_brea> and yeah the qr code apps should work
18:03:58 <take_a_deep_brea> Duj2: does the terminal on your computer give some output? if so can you share it here?
18:04:25 <take_a_deep_brea> some kind of output has to show up.
18:04:42 <Duj2> take_a_deep_brea Nothing at all, that's why I
18:04:55 <Duj2> Why i'm not sure how to troubleshoot this
18:04:59 <elmyder[m]> are you saying it runs but gives no output?
18:06:13 <Duj2> It just does nothing. Same when I just manually execute the first fastboot command from the script. Other fastboot commands like listing devices or rebooting work and give the expected output.
18:06:16 <take_a_deep_brea> it has to give output if it runs .
18:06:50 <Duj2> It's just stuck forever. I waited like 20 minutes or something.
18:07:03 <elmyder[m]> oh so it is not running
18:07:13 <elmyder[m]> at least that is what it sounds like
18:07:43 <take_a_deep_brea> did you install android-udev android-tools? im assuming yoj did
18:07:47 <take_a_deep_brea> nevermind that
18:07:55 <Duj2> Yes, both.
18:09:15 <take_a_deep_brea> are you using the usbc cable that came withtbe device on a usb c port ?
18:09:16 <elmyder[m]> You could try to strace or something to get more info about what is going on
18:09:30 <take_a_deep_brea> Duj2: so you were able to unlock right?
18:09:33 <thoughtmonster> thoughtmonster: I've used the install instructions and read the FAQ, but I'm stuck trying to flash graphene on a new Pixel 4a. I flashed it, and it didn't work, so I flashed back to factory and tried again, but still not working. I'm moderately proficient with the linux CLI, but new to flashing phones and new to android in general.  I'd appreciate
18:09:33 <thoughtmonster> any help. I'm using ubuntu based pop os.

18:10:40 <Duj2> take_a_deep_brea yes to using the original usbc cable on a usb c port. and i was able to unlock the device
18:12:18 <louipc> thoughtmonster: what version of fastboot do u have?
18:12:47 <take_a_deep_brea> Duj2: could you send a screenshot if the terminal?
18:13:09 <thoughtmonster> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
18:13:45 <Duj2> take_a_deep_brea I'll do that after a quick reboot.
18:13:45 <louipc> hmm not sure then
18:14:09 <louipc> thoughtmonster: oh can you see the device connected to usb?
18:14:48 <take_a_deep_brea> Duj2 ok try flashall agaim and then send a screenshot of that
18:14:54 <louipc> the other possiblities are udev problems, permissions problems, or usb cable problems
18:15:20 <thoughtmonster> Where/how should I be able to see it?
18:15:48 <elmyder[m]> permission problems should be reported in an error output, I would think
18:15:52 <thoughtmonster> The usb cable worked to flash back to factory.
18:16:11 <louipc> oh rite
18:16:16 <elmyder[m]> but like I said if you are just getting nothing you can strace it to see where it is getting hung up
18:17:01 <louipc> fastboot devices
18:17:52 <thoughtmonster> @louipc Yes, the device shows up.
18:19:31 <louipc> only thing i could think is doing it as root to get around possible permission problem, but it shouldnt be necessary...
18:20:56 <thoughtmonster> @louipc Thanks. I'll give it a try.
18:22:09 <louipc> thoughtmonster: btw did u apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common
18:22:15 <Duj2> take_a_deep_brea Not sure how I can send a screenshot here :D
18:23:17 <thoughtmonster> @louipc Yes.
18:24:34 <elmyder[m]> how you send an image will depend on which client you are using
18:24:52 <louipc> thoughtmonster: hmm your zip may be corrupted.. too. did it verify?
18:24:56 <take_a_deep_brea> Duj2: you arent on element are you?
18:25:15 <louipc> Duj2: you have to use some paste site
18:25:22 <louipc> like imgur or something
18:25:29 <thoughtmonster> @louipc It did verify, and I re-downloaded it when I flashed the second time, and it verified again.
18:26:42 <louipc> maybe your extraction utilities not available
18:28:12 <Duj2> take_a_deep_brea This is all I get (no output, just stuck forever on the first command without doing anything) https://i.paste.pics/3deda6daeeb4840a9c92d3773932f8f4.png
18:31:10 <take_a_deep_brea> well thats really weird. you could check running processes $ ps -la

18:34:02 <louipc> thoughtmonster: do you have program 'unzip' ?
18:34:34 <take_a_deep_brea> boy thats a mess, but from what i see does the column reading fastboot says R or D
18:34:34 <elmyder[m]> once again, it won't be easy to read, but you should in theory be able to get to the bottom of this by tracing the command to see what it is actually doing while it is running
18:34:55 <thoughtmonster> @louipc Yes
18:35:30 <Duj2> elmyder[m] Okay, I'll try that
18:35:51 <take_a_deep_brea> elmyder: my only concern is strace may interfere qith the flash.
18:36:12 <elmyder[m]> hmm well it doesn't seem the flash is happening in the first place
18:36:40 <louipc> thoughtmonster: or this: https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
18:36:56 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah thats true . so strace it is.
18:37:10 <thoughtmonster> @louipc I tried that first. :)
18:37:20 <louipc> okheh
18:37:31 <thoughtmonster> I have another machine running Ubuntu. I'll try it on that and see what output I get.
18:40:14 <Duj2> Okay, so for me the strace output is not very helpful, it's just stuck on: wait4(-1,
18:40:33 <Duj2> Should I just put it on pastebin or something? Would that be helpful?
18:40:40 <elmyder[m]> is it doing anything notable before that?
18:41:04 <Duj2> I'm not sure :D
18:41:15 <elmyder[m]> maybe. I am by no means the right person to troubleshoot this, but perhaps someone will be able to read it haha
18:41:49 <elmyder[m]> If you pastebin it I'll take a look, but no guarantee I know what the issue is lol
18:43:21 <Duj2> https://pastebin.com/2J2DMaP3
18:48:31 <Duj2> Maybe I'll just try using a different device. I would have preferred not doing this under Windows but that's the only other device I have unfortunately. If the fastboot command at least failed with some useful error it would be easier to troubleshoot this, so this might not be worth the time :D
18:53:20 <elmyder[m]> Good luck. I'm not sure what the issue is from this, except it doesn't look like a permission issue. It looks like it tries to run the same block twice and then gets hung up on the wait the second time. Not sure if "inappropriate ioctl for device" is relevant, as this happens right before the block repeats. But honestly, I can't do much more than guess lol
18:58:14 <Duj2> Thanks anyway everyone :)
18:58:55 <elmyder[m]> have you already tried running as root just to see?
19:00:26 <Duj2> Yes, already tried that. The install script is running under Windows just fine now. So I guess it does not matter what the problem was :D
19:00:51 <elmyder[m]> well, glad you got it working
19:00:53 <elmyder[m]> I do wonder... lol
19:02:41 <Duj2> Me too. I also don't like giving up on fixing the problem, but sometimes you have to stop going deeper into the rabbithole :D
19:03:17 <take_a_deep_brea> Duj2: good that it worked on windows for you.but i find it strange as ive flashed twice from arch linux and didnt have any issues.
19:05:06 <Duj2> Maybe I just broke my arch install somehow in a weird way idk
19:08:47 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah one thing was both the times i did it on almost base arch linux . but i dont think thats the reason . well anyways welcome to grapheneOS !

21:28:07 <craig351> I just installed GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a and it went very well. I installed from Ubuntu 20.04.    It would be very cool if I could buy a Graphene sticker to put over the G logo on the back.  Does that exist? Anyone up to set that up with or without me?  We'd have to ask Daniel if okay. But the profits could go to Donations for him.   A GrapheneOS
21:28:08 <craig351> Store.
21:38:06 <Schnyd> Just loaded Graphene, no mobile data and not receiving txt. I went to update the APN settings but they are grayed out. How can I do this?
21:41:35 <Thatcher[m]> <craig351 "I just installed GrapheneOS on a"> GrapheneOS stickers would be great
21:44:34 <lodtank> craig351: sounds like a nice idea, but don't know wether something like that is ok for the project
21:46:20 <craig351> My thoughts exactly, which is why I ask.
21:46:39 <craig351> I am just bringing it up. A proposition.
21:46:43 <Dar1n> Anyone else using Graphene OS and Tracphone?
21:48:30 <Dar1n> just for some reason can't get any lte data only 3g
22:13:44 <bentley> i use tracfone and can get lte
22:14:54 <bentley> or at least my mobile data toggle says "LTE" and i can access the internet from it
22:26:35 <Dar1n> bentley What are your preferred network settings
22:36:22 <jameshandcockand> Is it bad to update Vanadium et al. using the builds from here? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_vanadium
22:36:35 <jameshandcockand> Is it bad practice or does it matter?
22:44:15 <RookieGuy> I have the Pixel 4a 5G and have just read on the official Graphene OS website in the FAQ(s) that Graphene OS does not currently it so I wanted to ask if it will eventually (if known)?
22:45:34 <bentley> Dar1n: i followed the instructions on the tracfone website
22:52:07 <Dar1n> dar1n: bentley Hmm let me see
22:54:48 <Dar1n> bentley Where on the website did you find this info
23:00:04 <bentley> https://tracfone.com/apn i think
23:03:49 <Dar1n> bentley Thanks, hopefully I can fix this :/
23:10:56 <thoughtmonster> Well, I tried to flash the Pixel 4a again in Ubuntu, and I tried again in Ubuntu as root.

23:13:58 <thoughtmonster> Since I'm getting the same problems with different systems, I'm inclined to think that the issue is with the device. But I'm new to android and don't even know how to begin troubleshooting that.
23:17:17 <nscnt[m]> jameshandcockandjoe: There aren't releases for Vanadium on GitHub. Vanadium is a system app and gets updated through the system updates. Auditor on the other hand has its releases on GitHub and could be updated this way.
23:19:18 <nscnt[m]> Every release is signed with the same key. You can update Auditor through the apk on GitHub or even with the one provided on the Play Store.
23:20:49 <jameshandcockand> Oh okay, it looked like there was an option to download some sort of apk file on that github page
23:23:16 <squarmkt[m]> <RookieGuy "I have the Pixel 4a 5G and have "> There is no timeline as nobody has stepped up to support it. That can change.
23:35:02 <nscnt[m]> * jameshandcockandjoe: There aren't releases for Vanadium on GitHub. Vanadium gets updated through the system updates. Auditor on the other hand has its releases on GitHub and could be updated this way.
23:40:33 <yourmotherisbig[> Is it normal that nothing happens when i click check for updates?
23:41:19 <makingaliasesisa> I believe so.
23:41:45 <nscnt[m]> yourmotherisbig: There's just no feedback for the user, but it schedules a check.
23:52:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> jameshandcockandjoe: yes
23:53:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Upgrading system apps unless told to do so by a developer is unsupported
23:53:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you upgrade vanadium in this way then you will have to factory reset before you can get support again
23:54:15 <jameshandcockand> Sounds good
23:54:19 <jameshandcockand> Thanks for the response
23:54:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> And things will break
23:54:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why don't you try it to see how badly the system breaks instead of me telling you
23:56:17 <jameshandcockand> W-what
23:56:30 <jameshandcockand> What is happening now
23:56:37 <jameshandcockand> I feel this went hostile
23:57:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> jameshandcockandjoe: it's better you see for yourself if you aren't convinced
23:58:22 <jameshandcockand> I...am convinced???
23:58:28 <jameshandcockand> That's why I said thanks and sounds good
23:58:52 <jameshandcockand> As in my question has been answered and I won't do it, lmao
