00:07:04 <FieryBinary> Read the linked stuff first
00:07:23 <FieryBinary> Oh wait he disconnected lol
00:17:19 <m2tu[m]> anyone know if its possible to add third party app to Settings.apk ? so it will be possible to start an app from settings menu?
00:21:37 <FieryBinary> m2tu[m] One probably does it the same way as Android, by settings > apps&notifications > app info > app > open
00:24:21 <m2tu[m]> FieryBinary: thats a good hint... queston is how to get the code or copu shortcut into settings menu
00:25:52 <FieryBinary> m2tu[m] Do you mean menu right after you open settings?
00:27:15 <skwisgaar[m]> tacticalnewfy: fairemail is a great option. Have also heard good things about k9 mail. Head over to offtopic if you have more questions about services.
00:28:02 <m2tu[m]> FieryBinary: Yes. exaktlly.
00:28:38 <m2tu[m]> Yhis was possible in adnoid 6  but since everything changed. find no guide either . maby its not possible
00:28:55 <FieryBinary> m2tu[m] I don't think you can do that without modifications to the source code, but I am not completely sure.
00:29:05 <FieryBinary> Could someone more knowledgable answer that?
00:30:30 <skwisgaar[m]> I have no idea how you would do that but it‚Äôs not a built in feature of android.
00:30:48 <m2tu[m]> FieryBinary: before was possible to edit header.xml and string .. but now looks totaly different.
00:31:50 <skwisgaar[m]> Not sure why you would need to do that in the first place, isn‚Äôt that what the home screen is for?
00:31:53 <m2tu[m]> maby they ahve removed that option , but i think it must be possibe
00:32:07 <dazinism> m2tu: I don't think its possible without making your own builds
00:32:40 <m2tu[m]> i want that because im modyfing the os
00:33:25 <m2tu[m]> dazinism: im allredy building ... thats why i asked , want to implemet some apps to settings
00:36:20 <dazinism> m2tu: seamless update client is a GrapheneOS app thats added to the settings menus. Could look at that.
00:38:22 <m2tu[m]> dazinism: wow did not thought about that ....nice tips :)))) thanks for that.. ill check the code now
00:55:36 <doittoit[m]> Can all pixel phones become universally unlocked? Meaning all unlocked pixel phones can work on GSM and CDMA?
00:56:01 <doittoit[m]> And, can GOS be installed on those?
00:59:11 <doittoit[m]> Nevermind ... 2nd question found this https://grapheneos.org/install/web#prerequisites
01:27:24 <_mo> Im hoping Im not opening a can of worms asking this... but I gathered that grapheneos vs microg vs functioning messengers is a bit of a messy topic. From what I gather theres not gonna be any microg spoofing support, so does that mean grapheneos is a nogo for things like signal/threema?
01:28:46 <strcat[m]> Signal works fine
01:28:49 <strcat[m]> notifications work fine on GrapheneOS
01:28:51 <strcat[m]> you seem confused
01:29:30 <strcat[m]> some apps implement background push on their own when Google Play services isn't present, others don't
01:29:44 <strcat[m]> it certainly works fine when they do implement it without a hard dependency on Play
01:30:00 <_mo> I can only see that both Threema and Signal refuse(?) to register with the microG CMS, whereas the Push notification tester has no quarrel
01:30:23 <strcat[m]> Signal background push works perfectly on GrapheneOS / AOSP
01:30:32 <strcat[m]> microG isn't relevant, it's not supported
01:31:07 <_mo> ah, was not aware they had their own. I presume threema doesnt? Since it says itll fall back to pulling
01:31:18 <strcat[m]> microG doesn't offer an alternative push service but rather has an incomplete implementation of Google's push service
01:31:22 <strcat[m]> I don't use that app
01:31:35 <strcat[m]> Signal has working push on GrapheneOS, as do many other apps
01:31:39 <strcat[m]> some need to be appropriately configured
01:31:57 <strcat[m]> if the app only supports it via Play services then it won't work
01:31:58 <strcat[m]> it's simple
01:32:40 <strcat[m]> there's no microG so whether or not stuff works with the very incomplete implementation of Play services with that just isn't relevant
01:32:54 <strcat[m]> if it works without Play services, it works on GrapheneOS
01:34:49 <strcat[m]> same as AOSP
01:39:27 <_mo> okay that clears that up. Threema is locked to Play. Unfortunate for me I guess
01:48:13 <_mo> is there a chance to get CMs "long press the back button to kill -9 the currently focussed app"? I know theres magisk modules but thats obviously a no-go :)
02:08:59 <entry1[m]> <_mo "okay that clears that up. Threem"> After looking it up, Threema works. Just doesn't have a working push from what I can tell. I don't personally use it though.
02:09:37 <entry1[m]> This response should be in OT btw, but at least it will be in the logs if someone searches for it

11:32:54 <justthedoctor[m]> If my carrier supports sub6 5g and/or mmwave on a Pixel5 in my area, I'd imagine Graphene would work with that right? As in if I'd get 5g on Stock, I'll get 5g on Graphene right?
11:33:23 <justthedoctor[m]> I'm guessing yes since I don't see a "no" on the site, but I wanted to confirm.
12:02:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Amigo has joined the Telegram Group!
12:26:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I think thats a bug, happens pretty often around here
12:28:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> I don't see a reason why it wouldn't, graphene support everything that AOSP does.
12:32:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <h‚Äãonorablepee> Can I still maintain privacy with grapheneos whilst using Facebook or social media in some fashion?
12:34:12 <kamesjitt616[m]> Sure, but you are still using unsocial media. Doesn't matter how secure you are if you still access that garbage
12:46:14 <somenerd[m]> > Sure, but you are still using unsocial media. Doesn't matter how secure you are if you still access that garbage
12:46:14 <somenerd[m]> tbh, it really depends on what you mean by "secure" or "private"
12:46:36 <somenerd[m]> privacy from the services, probably not (like tracking what you do within the app)
12:46:56 <somenerd[m]> but you can restrict permissions heavily (including the sensors perm added on GrapheneOS)
13:22:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Privacy doesn't mean that should not give any data, because thats just impossible. Installing graphene allows you to choose what you give away. If you are fine with what you are giving away on Facebook then sure.
13:23:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Or just stay on the web version
13:49:53 <ryanrambharose> Do i need admin rights on windows to install graphene web?
13:49:57 <ryanrambharose> Windows 7
13:52:24 <strcat[m]> no
13:52:39 <strcat[m]> you need to be able to install the driver via Windows Update though
13:52:47 <ryanrambharose> Ok
13:52:54 <strcat[m]> if you don't have it already and don't have automatic updates set up to install those things automatically

15:03:50 <strcat[m]> lumpenqueer: not really what that means
15:04:06 <strcat[m]> nothing abnormal about what you're seeing there but it doesn't mean what you just said
15:04:41 <lumpenqueer[m]> Oh
15:04:58 <lumpenqueer[m]> Would u be able to explain what it actually means?
15:06:02 <joeth[m]1> <lumpenqueer[m] "Like I went to storage and it sa"> probably A/B system partition scheme that Pixels use. Essentially there are 2 system partitions so that your phone can seamlessly flash updates to the inactive partition and if something goes wrong when rebooting after an update it can just use the old system partition
15:06:21 <strcat[m]> it's not something specific to Pixels
15:06:28 <strcat[m]> every modern Android device uses A/B updates
15:06:52 <strcat[m]> and the OS images are not the only things included as System as I just said above
15:06:55 <joeth[m]1> my system is 13GB
15:07:04 <strcat[m]> System does not mean OS images
15:07:27 <strcat[m]> the OS partitions are only part of that memory
15:07:46 <lumpenqueer[m]> What are the other parts?
15:07:58 <strcat[m]> there is overhead for the filesystem itself too, including reserved memory, and the OS uses data too
15:08:10 <strcat[m]> lumpenqueer: it's all the system storage usage added up together
15:08:56 <strcat[m]> it's not simply the size of the OS x2 (i.e. the OS image partitions)
15:11:16 <lumpenqueer[m]> Ty

17:26:17 <stuartw1[m]> hi - I am looking at getting a new device and trying to decide between the recommended ones. Length of future grapheneOS support is a factor in my decision. Anyone have a view on whether it is worth buying a pixel 4a or paying 1.75 times more for a pixel 5?
17:26:52 <alloca> Get a pixel 4a
17:26:58 <alloca> you won't regret it
17:27:52 <ryanrambharose> Error: The requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired.
17:28:08 <stuartw1[m]> thanks - was leaning that way - but didnt want to buy a device that would be likely to be culled in a year rather than three years for the other device or something
17:31:19 <alloca> the pixel 4a prolly gonna have support for a good amount of time
17:31:28 <alloca> likely even longer than the 5
17:32:43 <stuartw1[m]> will maybe look into the github issues page and see if I can contribute if I get the time
17:33:49 <alloca> yeah
17:34:53 <stuartw1[m]> what about 4a vs 4a 5G? or is 4a still preferred
17:35:05 <stuartw1[m]> have seen the 5g one for 90$ more
17:35:19 <acg007[m]> go for 5G imho
17:35:24 <acg007[m]> but i would go for Pixel 5
17:36:03 <ryanrambharose> was incognito trying again
17:36:55 <alloca> depends
17:37:04 <alloca> are you gonna get 5g in your area?
17:37:25 <stuartw1[m]> probably - though i am not sure I will use it
17:37:57 <stuartw1[m]> guess I could get 4a now and then 6a when that comes out - or I could get a 5
17:38:16 <stuartw1[m]> and may be the same overall price
17:38:27 <stuartw1[m]> (if there is a 6a)
17:38:36 <alloca> nah just get a 4a
17:38:46 <alloca> stop worrying about the more modern phones
17:38:46 <neverfinished[m]> alloca:
17:38:46 <neverfinished[m]> O
17:39:12 <alloca> the 4a is great, you most likely won't really need to upgrade it for many years
17:39:51 <alloca> the 6a probably isn't gonna change mmuch
17:44:09 <stuartw1[m]> guess I am planning to use it for app testing / android internals stuff mainly so it probably wont leave my desk
17:44:28 <stuartw1[m]> unless i buy another if i really like it
18:05:57 <johnk347[m]> The 4a and 4a 5g have more differences than just 5g, the 5g version is larger than both the 4a and the 5, and has the same processor as the 5, and almost the same size battery.

18:27:04 <ryanrambharose> got it thanks!
18:43:05 <Maxxxed69> Hello?
18:43:34 <Budgii> Hi! Can GrapheneOS be installed on OnePlus 7 pro?
18:44:11 <KONCRETE[m]> no
18:44:43 <poisonoushydra[m> Budgii: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
18:44:49 <sphinx[m]> Budgii: https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
18:45:02 <KONCRETE[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
18:47:45 <ryanrambharose> Is there a recommended gcam app?
18:48:00 <Maxxxed69> Open camera
18:48:02 <Maxxxed69> from ffdroid
18:48:05 <Maxxxed69> fdroid&
18:48:14 <Budgii> thank you
18:49:30 <Maxxxed69> just so you're aware it's a open source camera app not made by google
18:50:44 <sphinx[m]> ryanrambharose: Third-party ports are not recommended. You can get the official one to work but there is no guarantee that it will keep working.
18:51:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> I second this
18:53:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãheGreyGhostPhantom> If you have a Pixel 4A with GrapheneOS, you can get the GCam 7.3 port which works just like stock
19:01:18 <Maxxxed69> deos anyone here use kvirc?
19:04:14 <Maxxxed69> puke
19:08:09 <Maxxxed69> Hello again. I had to rejoin.
19:09:53 <Maxxxed69> test
19:14:48 <Maxxxed69> Welcome
19:14:55 <Maxxxed69> How are you doing?
19:15:26 <Maxxxed69> polardroid:  You okay?
19:16:47 <Budgii> Maxxxed69: hello
19:16:52 <Budgii> test completed?
19:16:54 <Budgii> :P
19:16:57 <Maxxxed69> Lol
19:17:41 <Budgii> welcome )
19:17:43 <Budgii> :)
19:18:29 <Maxxxed69> You guys chillin*?
19:23:25 <Budgii> just working. how about you?
19:25:06 <Maxxxed69> I'm just waiting for a stimmiecheck so i can get the new pixel 5
19:25:11 <Maxxxed69> and install grapheneos on it.
19:25:36 <Maxxxed69> So i don't get any contact tracing sh!t...
19:25:48 <Budgii> I would love to try graphene. I have a OnePlus, though.
19:25:53 <Budgii> Seriously man.
19:26:57 <Maxxxed69> How come you're in the G OS chat?
19:27:52 <Budgii> just joined a few minutes ago, learned it was not compatible with my phone, haven't left yet. :P
19:30:39 <Maxxxed69> Hello?
19:30:45 <Maxxxed69> Sorry I keep disconnecting.
19:30:53 <Maxxxed69> Still getting use to my irc.
19:32:48 <Maxxxed69> Who here has the Oneplus who wants the grapheneos but cant install gos?
19:33:11 <Budgii> Maxxxed69, I want graphene, or want to try at least.
19:33:45 <Maxxxed69> I have a seriously old phone...
19:33:52 <Maxxxed69> Like... Biblically old.. XD
19:35:28 <Maxxxed69> Is there anyway you can get info on me if i say which phone I have?
19:35:31 <Maxxxed69> I doubt it.
19:35:36 <Maxxxed69> It's the moto z force.
19:38:10 <Budgii> Maxxxed69: bad mistake. Now everyone knows your SSN.
19:38:29 <Maxxxed69> NUUUUU... Errthing is owerrr fer meh.
19:38:40 <Budgii> kidding, by the way, since you want privacy you should probably use SASL instead of revealing your IP.
19:39:11 <Maxxxed69> idk how...
19:39:36 <Maxxxed69> Do you use kvirc?
19:39:43 <Budgii> No.
19:40:05 <Budgii> Never heard of it. I use weechat relay to glowing-bear
19:40:46 <poisonoushydra[m> Maxxxed69: https://freenode.net/kb/answer/kvirc
19:40:46 <Maxxxed69> You use linux?
19:41:00 <Budgii> not primarily.
19:41:21 <Maxxxed69> Just sometimes for the shitngrins?
19:42:39 <Budgii> I used linux Budgie for a while (go figure), and then I play with raspberry pi a little bit. where my weechat is also hosted
19:42:43 <Budgii> Why do you ask?
19:44:17 <Maxxxed69> 1sec
19:48:37 <Maxxxed69> Budgii: Because, I find linux cool.
19:51:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hey maxxxed69, you seem newhere's some recommended reading for you:https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/
20:14:33 <maxxxedout> test
20:14:54 <Budgii> test received.
20:18:21 <maxxxedout> I think i'm good here!
20:22:34 <maxxxedout> Budgii: this guy Budgii here is amazing
21:03:35 <joe84668194766> Hello.¬† Having an issue with SMS messages not triggering notifications until I tap the screen or open the device.¬† Its as though there's a process that is being put to sleep, anyone have a solution?¬† I've checked battery optimization and turned it off for SMS process, its not an option even for the messaging service
21:04:33 <joe84668194766> Running graphene on a pixel 4a
21:04:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> How about "Battery Saver", is it turned off?
21:04:52 <joe84668194766> Battery saver is off
21:05:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> idk then
21:07:10 <poisonoushydra[m> joe84668194766: Check Silent Notification settings, reset app data?
21:10:37 <joe84668194766> Tried this as well
21:12:38 <joe84668194766> What's odd is it doesn't happen all the time, only if the phone has been unused for some unknown period of time
21:33:39 <maxxxedout> F-Droid, Isn't that such a cool app? All FOSS?
21:36:29 <Shomat> Hi, anybody online here?
21:36:50 <jpds> maxxxedout: This channel is for support, you can chat in #grapheneos-offtopic
21:37:07 <Shomat> Hi, I need support
21:38:00 <Shomat> with WebUSB Install
21:40:52 <jpds> Shomat: What have you tried and what issue are you having with it?
21:42:19 <Shomat> tried using a Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspberry Pi OS for WebUSB install of GrapheneOS on Pixel 5
21:42:34 <Shomat> followed debian instructions
21:43:12 <Shomat> ‚Äúunlock bootloader‚Äù says ‚Äúno compatible device found‚Äù
21:43:31 <Shomat> I also tried cmd line install
21:44:05 <Shomat> I never got past verifying the Fastboot install
21:44:29 <Shomat> now I have no ideas left
21:56:33 <Shomat> ?
22:06:12 <entry1[m]> <Shomat "?"> Did you enable OEM unlocking on the device?
22:11:51 <ihtbasitc> hello, i'm having some trouble with the grapheneos cli install on a pixel 3a using arch. is anyone available to offer assistance?
22:12:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy ihtbasitc, yes, I can give you some aid. It may be faster and easier for you to try the webinstaller first though.
22:13:13 <TheJollyRoger> (You'll need to reboot your computer first in case the adb server is still running before you try it.)
22:13:54 <ihtbasitc> if it's all the same i'd like to stick with the cli install because i want to know what i'm messing up on
22:14:19 <ihtbasitc> i think it might be more a linux issue than a graphene issue
22:14:48 <ihtbasitc> my bootloader is unlocked, i've downloaded the images and verified their integrity
22:15:27 <TheJollyRoger> Well, you're halfway there then. What seems to be the problem and what error output are you getting?
22:15:31 <ihtbasitc> i have the packages android-tools and android-udev installed, and i've rebooted the laptop on which i'm initiating the flash
22:16:19 <ihtbasitc> i've extracted the factory images and i'm in the terminal, browsed to the extracted folder sargo-factory-2021.03.19.14
22:16:41 <ihtbasitc> i enter ./flash-all.sh, and i get no output
22:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> Are you using the Google branded cable?
22:17:01 <ihtbasitc> i've also tried sudo ./flash-all.sh
22:17:10 <ihtbasitc> ah no i am not
22:17:31 <TheJollyRoger> Try it with the google branded cable. Most USB cables don't have the trace that Fastboot needs to talk to the bootloader.
22:17:45 <ihtbasitc> i think i bought this cable at a gas station haha
22:18:02 <ihtbasitc> let me give that a try
22:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> If either the USB slot on your motherboard is missing the trace, or your cable is, or your motherboard's firmware support for USB is incomplete, then this is what results.
22:19:13 <TheJollyRoger> Generally, most vendors and OEMs only implement a small subset of the functionality needed by the majority of users to do day-to-day tasks, such as charging the device and media transfer. USB is actually an extremely complicated standard and not all vendors adequately implement everything.
22:19:52 <TheJollyRoger> This is why occasionally cheap cables can end up destroying devices or overcharging batteries leading them to explode, because they aren't allowing the devices to properly negotiate with the charger.
22:21:14 <ihtbasitc> i need to switch laptops as the google cable that came with the phone is c to c and my thinkpad only has usb a connectors
22:21:33 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
22:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> Something that you may find interesting:
22:22:18 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS does not treat the computer installing it as its root of trust; it instead uses the attestation data in the phone's security chip and verified boot keys as the root of trust.
22:23:38 <TheJollyRoger> So even if the computer installing the operating system isn't running an operating system you trust unconditionally, that actually doesn't matter so long as you have a device you trust to view the attestation data.
22:24:06 <TheJollyRoger> *it uses the security chip as its root of trust, along with the attestation data and verified boot keys.
22:33:45 <TheJollyRoger> Will return in a bit.
22:55:01 <vata0[m]> Does anyone have a link to anything that compares something like graphene vs iOS  for privacy and security and what not
22:55:19 <vata0[m]> I‚Äôve looked but I can‚Äôt find any info honestly
23:00:18 <kepoff[m]> <vata0[m] "Does anyone have a link to anyth"> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/
23:00:38 <kepoff[m]> I recommend you to read this.
23:02:56 <vata0[m]> Hell yes. Thanks bout to read it now
23:17:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> S (@s‚Äã28195) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:52:21 <vata0[m]> <kepoff[m] "https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> This was actually a crazy read. I was always under the impression that Linux was for sure Better then windows or macOS for security and privacy.
23:53:33 <asdasd100> hello, what are the security benefits of using a secondary profile for daily use?
23:54:24 <strcat> asdasd100: as explained in https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption simply the fact that you don't need to have it unlocked for the device to be usable
23:54:33 <strcat> that's it
23:54:46 <strcat> owner profile has to be active for the device to be usable
23:55:00 <strcat> to clarify, when you boot the device, you have to unlock the owner profile
23:55:19 <strcat> and 'end session' only exists for secondary ones (end session for the owner profile is rebooting)
23:59:38 <keys15> Hello, basic noob question here. I have recently flashed GraphenOS onto a Pixel 4a. I have been sticking with FOSS apps from F-droid, but I am curious about what if any limitations GrapheneOS puts on trackers from other apps. E.g., if an app has Facebook or Google trackers, does Graphene impose any protections or blocks on these trackers?
