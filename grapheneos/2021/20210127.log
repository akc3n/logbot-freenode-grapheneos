00:10:36 <Lost22> Hi everyone, I'm very interested in grapheneos and have a Pixle 3 XL I've been thinking about putting it on.  My main question is;  I have the ability to upgrade to a new phone but my 3Xl is working fine and has no issues with it so I've been considering replacing the OS instead.  I've done alot of searching but haven't been able to find out if
00:10:37 <Lost22> my cellular service (Verizon) will still be available for calls/messaging and to use cellular when away from wifi for internet access.
00:10:37 <Lost22> If I'm able to still use cellular for internet while away from wifi and there are no forseable consequences with my carrier  I'm totally sold on grapeneos and will likely flash it to my device in the next few days.
00:10:38 <Lost22> If that's not the case however I will still likely buy an unlocked Pixel and flash grapheneos to that.
00:10:38 <Lost22> Sorry for the dumb question but that's pretty much the only thing keeping me from getting rid of Google. Thanks anyways for taking the time to read this and any and all replies/comments are greatly appreciated.
00:12:03 <Lost22> I posted that question to reddit but didn't get any replies unfortunately, so I'm trying my luck here.  Any and all replies and comments are greatly appreciated!
00:12:43 <noobexterminator> Whats the question
00:14:49 <Lost22> My main question is;  I have the ability to upgrade to a new phone but my Pixel 3Xl is working fine and has no issues with it so I've been considering replacing the OS instead.  I've done alot of searching but haven't been able to find out if my cellular service (Verizon) will still be available for calls/messaging and to use cellular when away
00:14:50 <Lost22> from wifi for internet access after flashing GrapheneOS to the phone.
00:16:25 <noobexterminator> You're network still works after flashing grapheneOS
00:17:21 <noobexterminator> also start simplifying youre question its so fricking confusing i got lost reading it and i had to read it twice
00:17:34 <noobexterminator> Actually 4 times
00:18:21 <Lost22> Sorry about the excessive wording but thanks for the help though!
00:18:30 <noobexterminator> Do you have a unlocked phone?
00:18:37 <noobexterminator> with OEM unlocking?
00:19:17 <noobexterminator> If the answer is Yes then Yes you can flash Graphene on it and almost any other Os
00:20:04 <Lost22> Yes, Ive had my Pixel 3Xl for a little over a year.  Now I can upgrade to a new phone but have been seriously considering just replacing the OS with GrapheneOS because it has no issues and still works fine
00:20:27 <noobexterminator> What are you going to upgrade to
00:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> Lost22: the 3XL will be EOL (End of Life) come October, recall.
00:21:34 <noobexterminator> Yeah thats what i was about to say
00:21:51 <TheJollyRoger> So if I was in your position, what I'd probably do would be to start setting aside money for a new device now, budget accordingly, and then start shopping around later this year.
00:22:06 <noobexterminator> On Oct 2021 the updates stop
00:22:18 <TheJollyRoger> Once Upstream and Qualcomm abandon the handsets, they essentially force our hand.
00:23:22 <TheJollyRoger> At that point, the System on Chip itself will be insecure, and no matter you do at that point, no matter what operating system you install, so will the handset.
00:23:28 <Lost22> I can get an unlocked 4a now. Would you recommend just getting the 4a and flashing GrapheneOS to that?
00:23:32 <noobexterminator> If you can get the Pixel 4a becuase that phones going to have updates Till 2023
00:23:44 <noobexterminator> Yes
00:23:45 <TheJollyRoger> Lost22: that would be the most pragmatic option if you're fixing for a phone now.
00:24:47 <Lost22> Don't really need the new phone just want to get rid of Google haha. I'll get the 4a and flash grapheneos to that soon.  Thanks for the help and suggestions!

03:20:16 <goblinslayer[m]1> feel free to be my first friend on session : p
03:32:37 <kalbasit_> does microG work? It's reporting signature spoofing not supported
03:34:21 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_:  https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services may tell you why

03:35:08 <kalbasit_> If it's not supported. I need to figure out how to get myself on Google Meet for work.
03:35:15 <kalbasit_> It's part of Gmail nowadays
03:35:40 <take_a_deep_brea> kalbasit_:  could you ask this in #grapheneos-offtopic ?
03:36:02 <kalbasit_> sure
03:54:25 <b1101> one thing that always bothered on before using graphene, was some apps would start automatically if stopped, and not disabled. on graphene they stay stopped :)
03:55:49 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
05:43:23 <strcat[m]> what screwed up the room?
05:43:26 <somenerd[m]> believe that it locked down
05:43:26 <strcat[m]> whatever happened broke the bridge and people couldn't join
05:43:27 <somenerd[m]> the bridge as well?
05:43:27 <strcat[m]> people couldn't join matrix
05:43:27 <somenerd[m]> or just matrix?
05:43:28 <strcat[m]> and the bridge to IRC was broken
05:43:28 <strcat[m]> it's slowly recovering now that I toggled that
05:43:34 <somenerd[m]> hmm
05:43:43 <rny[m]> yes, bridge broken
05:43:43 <rny[m]> should consider hosting a grapheneos homeserver if matrix.org's abuse management is not up to scratch
05:43:44 <take_a_deep_brea> good idea.
05:44:53 <strcat> test
05:45:09 <TheJollyRoger> @ strcat I can see you from the IRC side.
05:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> I can't get Matrix to work though here.
05:45:29 <strcat> this is my irc client
05:45:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:45:48 <rny> bridge is back
05:45:49 <strcat> I think I fixed it
05:45:52 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
05:45:55 <TheJollyRoger> I think they're coming back now!
05:46:01 <strcat> toggling that
05:46:22 <strcat> matrix is so broken...
05:46:28 <rny[m]> matrix probably kicked the bridge
05:46:41 <rny> yea thats why i use irc mroe
05:46:43 <rny> :/
05:50:55 <strcat[m]> afaict the channel was broken somehow

06:02:11 <somenerd[m]> matrix loves lag
09:23:23 <w-debug> Hi. Is "wireless debugging" available with GrapheneOS? ADB's procedure (https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) says that "Pair device with pairing code" should appear after enabling "wireless debugging" but I don't get this pairing code. Thanks!
09:35:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> w-debug: we don't support users using adb or the hidden development menu
09:35:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you use it then you are on your own. Do not ask for support here
09:45:20 <w-debug> anupritaisno1[m]: Thanks for your answer
09:47:09 <take_a_deep_brea> w-debug: developer mode settings are not supposed to be exposed to the end user so in case you had some use case in mind other than some app or OS development than please consider better user-facing alternatives like apps or OS feature
09:55:22 <w-debug> take_a_deep_brea: Thanks for your answer! My use case is that GrapheneOS does not provide an app store. Consequently, I wanted to verify the apk of stores (like: aurora and/or fdroid, etc.) before installing them. Those verifications can only happen on a PC. Then the stores' apk can be passed to the phone via adb... and a wireless connection is
09:55:22 <w-debug> more convenient. You know the whole story! :-)
09:56:13 <take_a_deep_brea> well we can discuss this further in #grapheneos-offtopic if you dont mind ?
10:14:43 <whatanawfulface[> Has anyone here had any luck mounting a Samba share in Graphene? Have to say the OS has been fantastic so far, this is the only thing that's given me trouble. I can mount the share and browse it, but apps cannot open any of the files. I'm guessing a permissions issue, but see no options to set permissions when mounting the share...
10:51:12 <dar_gomml[m]> <whatanawfulface[ "Has anyone here had any luck mou"> what are you using to mount a smb share? and it also depends on the app you are trying to open the file with. may i ask what kind of file you want to open?
10:56:08 <whatanawfulface[> I've tried using ghost commander and android samba client, same issue either way. They're just VR video files that I'm trying to open with a VR player, but they don't open in VLC from the share either. Copying one of them to local storage allows either app to playback fine.
12:02:35 <justanotherlurke> <whatanawfulface[ "I've tried using ghost commander"> Mounting LAN shares by local IP (192.168.x.y) via Total Commander app and playing MP4 located there via VLC works on my GOS 4XL.
12:07:09 <xv73j[m]> Hello, sorry to disrupt the current discussion but I updated GOS on my pixel 3 and now it won't get past the GOS splash screen. Unfamiliar with what I should do next, recovery mode or rescue mode. the bootloader is still locked.
12:09:44 <bastidvw1[m]> <xv73j[m] "Hello, sorry to disrupt the curr"> Did it ever work?
12:11:40 <xv73j[m]> I hadn't restarted until earlier in which I put my phone in my plastic car mount (which needs foam because it presses buttons), looked away and then saw that it was at the bootloader screen. I booted it once but it froze when I tried to unlock it for the first time.
12:15:38 <bastidvw1[m]> I also have a pixel 3 and haven't had any issues. Perhaps you should reinstall the OS
12:16:58 <xv73j[m]> Is there a way I can get in to get my data back or will I need to wipe? Also, can I install with the bootloader locked?
12:17:46 <xv73j[m]> Er, the setting I'm referring to is OEM unlocking
12:17:50 <take_a_deep_brea>   xv73j: so you are unable to use the phone normally at all ?
12:18:15 <xv73j[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "  xv73j: so you are unable to us"> No, just stuck at the GrapheneOS splash screen.
12:19:19 <take_a_deep_brea> modern android devices have A/B partitioning just so that if an update is not done properly then the previous image is still available to boot
12:19:39 <take_a_deep_brea> <xv73j[m] "No, just stuck at the GrapheneOS"> so thats a yes ?
12:20:10 <xv73j[m]> I mean yes I cannot use the phone at all.
12:20:15 <take_a_deep_brea> ok
12:20:38 <take_a_deep_brea> to sieload an update you would need adb
12:20:46 <take_a_deep_brea>  * to sideload an update you would need adb
12:21:05 <take_a_deep_brea> same i think is true for data transfer
12:23:07 <xv73j[m]> yes, I'm booted into w10 and am updating platform-tools now
12:36:20 <dar_gomml[m]> <justanotherlurke "Mounting LAN shares by local IP "> same here with amaze file explorer. vlc is smb capable in its own too.
12:36:37 <dar_gomml[m]> * same here with amaze file explorer. vlc is smb capable on its own too.
12:40:45 <xv73j[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "modern android devices have A/B "> How would I do this? Currently I am at the stage where it only enumerates in adb while in "rescue mode", but adb shell does not work. Preferably I would like to back up my data first...
12:41:44 <take_a_deep_brea> xv73j: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-sideloading
12:41:56 <take_a_deep_brea> go through it .
12:42:37 <xv73j[m]> Yes, I have seen that page, isn't that just loading a new OS? That will wipe my data, correct?
12:42:53 <take_a_deep_brea> ok yeah sorry for that .
12:43:02 <take_a_deep_brea> no an update wont
12:43:32 <whatanawfulface[> <justanotherlurke "Mounting LAN shares by local IP "> Aha, progress. I guess both the file managers I tried just had issues. Using total commander I can now open the files on my share. Granted my VR video player is now erroring when I try to do so, but that's not a Graphene problem. Thanks!
12:43:47 <take_a_deep_brea> but wait let me confirm
12:44:07 <take_a_deep_brea> xv73j: it should just work fine
12:44:21 <bastidvw1[m]> Does Graphene have OTA updates or does it have to be through a computer?
12:44:21 <take_a_deep_brea> an update erasing all user data is absurd
12:45:03 <take_a_deep_brea> bastidvw1: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates the first paragraph describes stuff in enough detail
12:45:18 <take_a_deep_brea> and yes
12:48:16 <take_a_deep_brea> xv73j: what i told you to do is assuming that you had a broken update
12:48:57 <take_a_deep_brea> did you try rebooting again after you saw that the device got stuck on the splash screen ?
12:49:48 <xv73j[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "did you try rebooting again afte"> I've rebooted several times now. i just downloaded the image and will try sideloading from rescue mode, recovery mode doesn't seem to enumerate in adb
12:53:07 <take_a_deep_brea> just check that the zip file says blueline_ota_update before you sideload it . all the best !
12:54:04 <xv73j[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "just check that the zip file say"> Thanks for pointing that out, had the other update.
13:00:47 <xv73j[m]> unlocked the bootloader in fastboot, stuck at adb: sideload connection failed: device authorized
13:01:03 <xv73j[m]>  * unlocked the bootloader in fastboot, stuck at adb: sideload connection failed: device unauthorized
13:05:19 <take_a_deep_brea> you dont need to unlock the bootloader . you just need to go to the recovery mode and select apply update from ADB
13:05:32 <take_a_deep_brea> you should have read the sideload section .
13:06:26 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-sideloading
13:07:33 <take_a_deep_brea> please do not try relocking the bootloader
13:07:43 <take_a_deep_brea> that will certainly wipe all data
13:09:14 <take_a_deep_brea> if you did `fastboot flashing unlock` then i am really sorry
13:10:05 <xv73j[m]> Ah, my apologies, I skimmed over the line to select the menu within adb recovery. But I seemed to have booted into a wiped version of GOS by accident so maybe I reset something. I guess this is a tough lesson :(
13:10:31 <take_a_deep_brea> hopefully you didnt have anything very critical in there
13:10:34 <xv73j[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "if you did `fastboot flashing un"> Yeah I did that, oops. There goes my data
13:11:10 <xv73j[m]> It's an annoyance but I'll be okay. take_a_deep_breath
13:11:16 <xv73j[m]>  * It's an annoyance but I'll be okay. take_a_deep_breath thanks for your help!
13:11:19 <take_a_deep_brea> if you reached recovery mode then you probably did a factory reset
13:12:40 <take_a_deep_brea> you are welcome ~
13:12:47 <take_a_deep_brea>  * you are welcome !
13:17:26 <xv73j[m]> Since I'm here, the stock dialer app on my Pixel 3 doesn't seem to have visual voicemail, should I get it through a third party?
13:18:02 <take_a_deep_brea> xv73j: discussion about apps is better done in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
13:18:23 <take_a_deep_brea> no one will interrupt you there , though .
13:20:13 <bastidvw1[m]> New to Graphene. Are updates OTA? When I checknfor updates in settings I can click toncheck but there is no progress bar or indicator. Is there a problem with my install?
13:20:32 <bastidvw1[m]> * New to Graphene. Are updates OTA? When I check for updates in settings I can click to check but there is no progress bar or indicator. Is there a problem with my install?
13:27:56 <christian-h> <bastidvw1[m] "New to Graphene. Are updates OTA"> Yes updates are ota. There is no progress bar. As soon as an update is availabe you will be notified and it will be installed in the background. On the next boot, your device will run on the update.

Actually the procedure I followed was this: I downloaded the Visible app on another phone (also a Pixel 3a XL) and started the activation process. When I reached the point that they want to to restart your phone to finish the activation, I pulled the SIM and put it in
16:09:14 <charlie67j[m]> the phone with GrapheneOS and restarted it. After boot it was activated and everything seems to be working. LTE phone calls, WiFi calling, all of the normal communications apps. I'll try this for a month and see how it works out. I'm on the latest GrapheneOS update for the 3a XL.

19:24:30 <strcat[m]> you aren't saying what OS you're on or providing other details
19:24:37 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading the information in the guide including on USB
19:24:49 <ascac> win10
19:24:51 <strcat[m]> no additional help can be provided without more information including what you have tried based on the information in the guide
19:25:19 <strcat[m]> ascac: go into Windows Update, go to optional updates, make sure you have the fastboot driver
19:27:20 <ascac> i have it if i check for --version
19:27:25 <ascac> but in add. update
19:27:48 <ascac> there are updates for adb interface and bootloader interface
19:27:53 <ascac> do i need them?
19:28:31 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> ascac: You need the bootloader one
19:28:50 <ascac> thanks
19:29:36 <strcat[m]> you're not supposed to need to install drivers manually but for some reason some people don't have it working automatically
19:30:39 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I wonder, if this might have something to do with Windows that didn't come with the device, but was rather installed from an ISO
19:30:52 <strcat[m]> don't think so
19:31:20 <tidria[m]> It may be a Windows thing, when I did my 3a a year ago it was automatic but I notice when I am using a new install recently it wasn't automatic
19:31:43 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Might be that Windows stopped including those drivers by default
19:31:50 <strcat[m]> most people seem to have optional updates by default
19:32:01 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Might be that Windows stopped in"> At least the bootloader ones
19:32:05 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> > <@skyfox:kde.org> Might be that Windows stopped including those drivers by default
19:32:05 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m>  * At least the bootloader one
19:32:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Windows updates are optional for quite a while if they are drivers
19:32:23 <tidria[m]> Ya I'm not sure but at least the official drivers aren't hard to find
19:32:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> They only update if a future version is going to drop support
19:33:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fetching drivers for a device that the computer doesn't know about isn't an optional upgrade
19:33:16 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> This is what it says under optional updates:
19:33:17 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m uploaded an image: image.png (9KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/kde.org/8ea0a4234f90e0d53eba24198cfda1907b9d7705/image.png >
19:33:53 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> And I think the bootloader and adb drivers appeared there only after I tried flashing Graphene
19:42:44 <Hardbrick> Hi
19:43:29 <Hardbrick> Anyone know when Brambo will be available for Graphene? Pixel 4a 5G
19:46:01 <TheJollyRoger> It will be available when there is a maintainer available that can support the device.
19:46:10 <TheJollyRoger> Would you like to step up?
19:47:05 <Hardbrick> If I could know how to do it. I could be able to help out this project.
19:47:12 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
19:47:24 <Hardbrick> MAteee!
19:49:06 <Hardbrick> How would you learn how to do that in the future?
19:49:06 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehehe. Support for newer devices is on the books, just, right now we need a little help, it's something of a full time job to support a device and do it in a way that meets or exceeds the diligence and attention of the vendor operating system.
19:49:09 <TheJollyRoger> Well...
19:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> Usually the first thing to do is to learn to build and compile the operating system and get comfortable with the tooling.
19:49:51 <Hardbrick> understood
19:50:19 <TheJollyRoger> The next step is to get familiar with git and how to merge and add patches. Some programming knowledge is needed for this (unfortunately that's where I fall short at this very moment).
19:50:44 <TheJollyRoger> The most important part though is that it's a commitment; usually the devices are expected to last ~3 years, so it's definitely not a once-and-done sort of thing.
19:53:19 <Hardbrick> Understood. Not like a get stuff for you then bail out. its a commitment to it
19:53:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
19:54:23 <TheJollyRoger> I think you're in luck though, because if you've got a 4a5G, one of the devs is actually looking to work with 4a5G users.
19:54:41 <VW[m]> <tidria[m] "IMG_20210127_140354.jpg"> I don't have any network settings in Aurora.
19:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> But this is *also* a commitment, so if you have a spare device, it'd be best to use that in interim and expect the 4a5G to be used a lot for testing, it can be extremely time intensive and require resetting a lot.
19:56:42 <Hardbrick> Well was not smart about it and didnt look at the codename while I was flashing the boot of the sunfish that is actually brembo. Didnt realize this hence the hardbrick nickname hahahaha
19:56:50 <TheJollyRoger> ...oh... OH GOD
19:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> ...can you RMA?
19:57:20 <tidria[m]> Oh dear..
19:57:30 <TheJollyRoger> I think the phone's toast, if the boot loader is gone.
19:57:52 <Hardbrick> Maybe? its 42 days old. called last night to unlock the bootloader since the app didnt let me do it.
19:58:00 <Hardbrick> yeah its gone
19:58:10 <TheJollyRoger> Oh god. Hurry, get Google on the line, see if you can get a RMA.
19:58:31 <Hardbrick> probably can not even use a USB downloader as there isnt an option for it.
19:58:38 <Hardbrick> haha learning is fun!
19:58:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah X(... in some cases!
19:59:04 <TheJollyRoger> If you paid for it with a Mastercard I think Mastercard extends the basic warranty to 90 days. Your credit card company might have your back, circumstances depending.
19:59:06 <tidria[m]> Damn sorry to hear
19:59:08 <ascac> i succesfully installed it, thank u guys!
19:59:19 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: Yarr-harr! Welcome aboard the ship!
19:59:27 <Hardbrick> oh payed cash for it at the carrier store
19:59:40 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, aarghh...
19:59:42 <ascac> :)
19:59:47 <Hardbrick> Graphene is awesome!
20:00:10 <ascac> would it make sense to be here from time2time? like for discuss new features etc
20:00:12 <tidria[m]> Damn.. could try the old DOA approach
20:00:13 <tidria[m]> Store might not know better
20:00:24 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: of course it makes sense to be here!
20:01:05 <Hardbrick> haha well not sure if there is any type of warranty on it. need to look into it more
20:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hardbrick, look in the bottom of the box, I think there may be a warranty card?
20:02:10 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: Of course you should stay! This channel (and its sister channel, the -offtopic channel) has some great and vibrant (and knowledgeable) personalities.
20:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> We sail for security every night!
20:03:38 <ascac> u got some tipps maybe for a new install? i heard that vanadium isnt the best browser for purposes
20:03:55 <Hardbrick> Gonna check it out after work. Just came with the carrier sim card
20:04:06 <ascac> good to know, ill get myself a right nic then soon
20:04:29 <TheJollyRoger> Hardbrick: Oh, crud... fingers crossed!
20:04:35 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: yarr!
20:05:51 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: for first time firstcomers to GrapheneOS, usually what I like to do is pair with attestation server (https://attestation.app) and usually install Signal (https://signal.org/android/apk), and get FairEmail from Github. There's also the Aurora store, although on occasion the tokens get broken so you must enable custom tokenizer if it goes down.
20:06:34 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: Vanadium is the best browser for GrapheneOS, since it takes advantage of the sandboxing specific to GrapheneOS. The only other browser this project recommends at this point in time is Bromite.
20:06:51 <TheJollyRoger> There's a usage guide at https://grapheneos.org/usage which should help you out.
20:07:21 <TheJollyRoger> If you use the camera a lot, look up OpenCamera, which can support the Pixel Visual Core GPU and take much nicer pictures than the extremely basic AOSP camera app.
20:08:32 <Hardbrick> server popped me out for some reason. gonna look into warranty and repair options. hope that later there will be an option for that one.
20:09:05 <Hardbrick> Take care and this project is awesome!! Privacy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20:10:22 <TheJollyRoger> Hardbrick: yarr!
20:17:43 <ascac> Okay guys thanks for the advices. See u
20:17:54 <ascac> or last thing
20:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: Yarr, what is it?
20:18:16 <ascac> is there any comperisation between bromite and vanadium?
20:18:31 <TheJollyRoger> also, before I forget! If you find GrapheneOS useful or want to support development, be sure to drop the devs something at https://grapheneos.org/donate - the project's entirely funded by donations, they're the lifeblood of the project.
20:18:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yeah, Bromite and Vanadium --
20:18:37 <ascac> i saw in an review that vanadium should somehow connect to a indirect google server or smt
20:19:05 <TheJollyRoger> There are default connections, they're documented under https://grapheneos.org/faq - they're made very deliberately.
20:19:16 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to Vanadium:
20:20:18 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium at this moment attempts to blend in with the crowd by mimicking the browser fingerprint of a normal Pixel, for your device. This is actually very deliberate, because you don't want to stand out from the crowd,
20:22:01 <TheJollyRoger> for instance, all sorts of side channels exist where sites can tell if you're spoofing your browser fingerprint, not sending information your browser should, and that sort of thing, and use that to determine the uniqueness of your browser. You don't want to be the one person in the crowd claiming to be a Samsung device... which hey, that's weird, it has the exact processing speed and renders
20:22:03 <TheJollyRoger> pages in the same time that a Pixel would.
20:23:04 <TheJollyRoger> Or hey, this user's blocked this advertising domain, and this advertising domain, and this one... so let's enumerate all the domains they've blocked, and then use that to track their device by the uniqueness of what advertising domains they don't respond to.
20:23:54 <TheJollyRoger> Bromite actually co-operates with Vanadium on a few things, but it's a different project that tries to do ad blocking if I recall correctly.
20:24:36 <TheJollyRoger> As well as anti-fingerprinting. However, it doesn't include the security hardening, exploit mitigations, and such that Vanadium does, because Bromite is intended to run anywhere, and Vanadium needs some of GrapheneOS' security improvements in order to do its thing.
20:25:00 <noobexterminator> Is Vanadium more secure than Firefox
20:25:09 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: Yes, greatly.
20:25:22 <ascac> thanks a lot!!!!
20:25:25 <noobexterminator> Wow
20:25:29 <TheJollyRoger> Firefox takes an "all your eggs in one basket" approach and doesn't bother internally sandboxing.
20:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> Mozilla has a lot of good marketing and good PR.
20:27:11 <noobexterminator> Moz://a
20:27:20 <noobexterminator> 🤖
20:27:37 <ascac> bye
20:27:47 <TheJollyRoger> ascac: yarr, fare thee well and see ye soon.
20:27:59 <noobexterminator> Goodbye ascac
20:28:05 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, just missed 'em!
20:28:13 <noobexterminator> 😢
20:28:36 <TheJollyRoger> noobexterminator: there's some more you can read on it, madaidan[m] actually wrote a brief outline here: https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
20:30:23 <VW[m]> <TheJollyRoger "As well as anti-fingerprinting. "> This is great information. Thanks. I am so glad I chose Graphene over Calyx.
20:30:43 <TheJollyRoger> VW[m]: yarr! You've made the right choice, shipmate!
20:39:52 <strcat[m]> VW: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/features
20:40:04 <billzster> I was recommended before Brave is Bromite still a better option?
20:40:30 <strcat[m]> yes
20:40:35 <strcat[m]> don't use Brave
20:40:48 <billzster> Done! - Thank YOU
20:43:52 <a24678247> What are the concerns of using Google maps without an account in its own user profile, and if need be, turning off all permissions when not in use?
20:45:44 <tidria[m]> Brave is one browser I never used nor read much about, what's the primary issue with it out of curiosity?
20:46:10 <a24678247> I think most people who dislike it (I don't want to speak on behalf of them, it's just what I've heard) dislike the ads
20:46:17 <a24678247> and the fact that they still serve ads and it's a primary business model
20:46:26 <a24678247> others don't like anything regarding the chromium browser
20:48:59 <a24678247> but Brave did an AMA on reddit, some of the questions will give insight into why some people don't like it
20:50:28 <tidria[m]> Privacy aside I can appreciate why ads as a business model in a browser is off-putting. I'll read that AMA along with their page, thanks
20:50:52 <strcat[m]> tidria: well, for one thing, the CEO / founder of the company is a dishonest scumbag who can't be trusted so despite having some good people working for them the company as a whole is DOA
20:51:23 <tidria[m]> Lol really? What's the controversy on the CEO?
20:51:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: pm
20:51:59 <strcat[m]> tidria: I know him, I'm not talking about public controversy
20:52:36 <tidria[m]> Ahh got it, I'll read a bit in my spare time on the company
20:52:40 <tidria[m]> Thanks
20:53:09 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't be surprised if the whole company got wiped out for securities fraud
20:53:13 <strcat[m]> by the SEC
20:57:32 <strcat[m]> just use Bromite, it's actually good
20:57:44 <strcat[m]> and doesn't do sketchy things like add in referral codes to URLs, replace ads on site with their own, etc.
20:57:57 <strcat[m]> or launch an illegal security
20:59:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Who is the mere mortal here who recommendeth le bromite over the godly vanadium
20:59:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry forgot this isn't the OT chat
21:04:51 * TheJollyRoger smashes the glass box full of wooden rulers reading: "In case of heresy, break glass."
21:05:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: check signal
21:05:56 <a24678247> What are the concerns of using Google maps without an account in its own user profile, and if need be, turning off all permissions when not in use?
21:07:00 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Giving your location mainly.
21:09:21 <a24678247> Are there privacy/security concerns with navigation using Magic Earth or Open Street Maps?
21:09:41 <a24678247> I have not used either. I am less concerned about just looking up directions, and mostly curious about the realtime navigation aspects
21:09:59 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> It's the same as Gmaps
21:10:06 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> You are giving them your current location
21:10:18 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> So it really comes down to who you would rather give that info
21:10:53 <a24678247> That makes sense
21:11:13 <a24678247> Thank you
21:11:25 <nora[m]> Well your location isn't really transmited when you are using OSMAnd~
21:11:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Some people also say, that Open Street Maps may not have enough information about their area, so Gmaps might be better
21:11:36 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m>  * Some people also say, that Open Street Maps may not have enough information about their area, so Gmaps might be better in that sense
21:12:26 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Some people also say, that Open "> It worked 99% of the time for me, but that 1% can be really annoying, especially if you need to look something up quickly
21:13:00 <nora[m]> * Well your location isn't really transmited to a server when you are using OSMAnd~
21:35:45 <noobexterminator> Guys
21:35:54 <noobexterminator> Can i uninstall grapheneOS
21:36:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> noobexterminator3000: yes, we have an FAQ section covering that
21:36:37 <mike-of-earth> There are instructions on the graphene website for returning your mobile to stock
21:36:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot erase avb_custom_key and then just use the Google flash tool when booted into the bootloader to revert
21:36:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's your devicenoobexterminator3000
21:43:18 <noobexterminator> 3a
21:43:31 <noobexterminator> Plssssssss
21:43:49 <noobexterminator> Ok
21:43:59 <noobexterminator> Thanks anupritaisno1
21:44:05 <noobexterminator> 👍
22:13:43 <TheJollyRoger> Bridge went down again. Everyone hang on tight.
22:17:58 * snooopy grabs the next rope to hang on tight!
22:24:01 <TheJollyRoger> It should be back soon, let's hope!
22:27:29 <nux> TheJollyRoger: What bridge are we talking about?
22:47:29 <TheJollyRoger> nux: I think the Matrix-to-Freenode bridge is down, again.
22:47:38 <billzster> question - some apps wont run with internet when using a multi-user profile. Wont even allow to install f-droid though the internet does work on browser. Is this normal
22:47:44 <TheJollyRoger> We just lost about ~800 members. They should come back soon.
22:48:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hi billzster, is the version of F-Droid you are attempting to install the same as the version of F-Droid you have installed in your other profiles?
22:48:34 <billzster> I think so.. Never checked
22:48:50 <TheJollyRoger> If it isn't the same, or newer, GrapheneOS will stop you from installing old versions. Android doesn't allow you to install older versions as a part of the anti-downgrade attack policy.
22:49:32 <TheJollyRoger> The version of F-droid on the site is a little bit out of date compared to the one pushed via the update channel... so sometimes that ends up causing issues.
22:51:08 <billzster> K will check it out good direction
23:29:14 <rny[m]> bridge broken aagain
23:29:22 <rny> oh nvm its not
23:29:27 <rny> just lots of lag
23:58:49 <void9> could someone give me advice on how to fix an issue regarding the installation of GrapheneOS
23:59:54 <noobexterminator> I dont even use copper head bruh
