01:30:30 <void125[m]> So how do I restore a seedvault backup (from my nextcloud server) if neither f-droid and nextcloud apk aren't preloaded?  I see a nextcloud restore option in the setup wizard but the apk isn't baked in to the os.
01:30:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> void125[m]: Remember you should attempt to disable Internet access from the settings if it does ask for it.
01:30:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Talking about GCam.
01:31:19 <void125[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<gochoingles> Talking about GCam"> Yes, thank you for the reminderüôÇüôÇüôÇ
01:33:31 <TheJollyRoger> void125[m]: You can restore the seedvault backup from the GrapheneOS launcher, when you first start the operating system, it will ask you, and then you can plug in your USB drive containing your seedvault backup files. If you're past the launcher, you can start it manually using android debug bridge, but that's not generally recommended, since it must restore your system configuration and
01:33:33 <TheJollyRoger> sometimes this can cause problems if you're already running and using the phone.
01:33:47 <TheJollyRoger> Since Seedvault assumes you are restoring a phone that has never been used.
01:35:33 <TheJollyRoger> Seedvault is built into the operating system, it's accessible under Settings -> System -> Backup, but you must restore onto a device that hasn't seen use yet, otherwise you can run into problems. Yes, you can trigger the launcher after it's run, but I would not advise you doing that unless you're ready to take some risks.
01:39:36 <void125[m]> Appreciate your detailed reply TheJollyRoger .  I've restored from a USB drive but was hopeful to be able to restore directly from Nextcloud if needed.  I asked because this was a functional option under CalyxOS.  All goodüôÇ
01:40:45 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe in the future, hope this helps!
01:45:22 <void125[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Maybe in the future, hope this h"> Excellent!
01:56:55 <TheJollyRoger> legroslulu[m]: If you're getting "Waiting for device", this means that fastboot, for some reason, can't connect to the device. If you're running a Linux host you will need to make sure you have the correct udev rules and if you are on Windows you will need to make sure you have the driver for fastboot installed via Windows update.
01:59:46 <TheJollyRoger> So if you're on Linux, you'll need to check how you get those udev rules. Once you add them, you'll either need to reboot the computer or reload the udev rules. If you're on Windows, plug in your phone while it's running fastboot, then go to Windows update and there should be an optional driver update there for you.
02:03:17 <legroslulu[m]> I am using Windows 10 and the update yields nothing. I will check again.
02:04:27 <legroslulu[m]> There is nothing to update unfortunately
02:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> Very strange, does device manager show you something about an Android Bootloader interface being plugged in?
02:06:43 <legroslulu[m]> No device plugged in but I do get a sound when I plug my phone.
02:08:14 <legroslulu[m]> Could the adapter do that? I am using the wire that came with the phone and I am using a USB-A to USB-C adapter.
02:08:20 <TheJollyRoger> Nothing under "LeMobile Android Device?"
02:08:23 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
02:08:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, do you have a high quality USB A to USB C cable? USB 3.1 Gen 1 or later?
02:09:07 <legroslulu[m]> I see a Pixel 4a with a yelllow triagle
02:09:39 <legroslulu[m]> Trying to resolve the problem
02:09:46 <TheJollyRoger> It'll need to say "Android Bootloader Interface" for Fastboot to talk to the bootloader.
02:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> (Under device manager)
02:11:12 <TheJollyRoger> Might be the adapter... you'll want to plug the cables in to your motherboard directly.
02:12:06 <TheJollyRoger> Or use a native USB-A-to-C cable. We've often found that some vendors are really careless and don't put in all the wires that the fastboot program needs to talk to the bootloader on the phone.
02:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> Which isn't your fault, mind you, it's because USB is a very complicated protocol and not every vendor does it right.
02:12:52 <legroslulu[m]> It says "Pixel 4a". I will buy a cable USBIF certified tomorrow and see if that woks.
02:13:02 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Keep us posted.
02:13:15 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta run, so I'll see you soon, good luck.
02:13:25 <legroslulu[m]> I will and thank you for pointing me in the right direction.

06:16:49 <bewarsi> Hello, I came across some posts where people installed gcam with microg but they were a year ago.
06:17:31 <bewarsi> I was wondering if I could install gcam with microg on my pixel 4a instead of open camera?
06:17:57 <bewarsi> Apologies if this isn‚Äôt the right place to ask..
06:18:18 <dannyknoll3Danny> Why "with microg"?
06:19:12 <bewarsi> Apparently, at the time the gcam worked only if microg was installed. It would give a black screen if microg wasn‚Äôt installed.
06:19:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚Äãengu_Gone_Complicated> You canGcam doesn't need micro g to be system appAnd also there is some project that is very minimal version of micro g to make gcam only work
06:19:58 <bewarsi> Would love to have it work without microg
06:20:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚Äãengu_Gone_Complicated> Gcam-Services-ProviderThis app "simulates" the Google Play Services that Gcam requires, allowing the camera app to be used on devices without Google Play Services. The app does not have a Ui for the simple reason that it is not needed.https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider#gcam
06:21:53 <bewarsi> oh awesome. I will check it out. Thank you for the help!
06:46:29 <ransome> Hi, Graphene documentation states "GrapheneOS creates fresh processes (via exec) when spawning applications ..." which can lead to longer start up times of around 100ms.  I'm on a Pixel 3a and for me this number is more at 2000ms than 100 ms.  I'm trying to figure out if this is me or just how it is suppose to be in general on Pixel 3a devices. How are your experiences with this?
06:49:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> ransome: it is not noticeable on current devices
06:49:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> The pixel 3a devices had some corners cut to bring prices down which made it noticeable in the first place
06:49:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Otherwise there is no perceivable difference
06:50:24 <ransome> Ok I see, thanks for your feedback!
07:57:55 <pizzaeater69[m]> Is it safe to block sensor access from system apps like vanadium webview

10:42:28 <firdeus[m]> Hello, how i call record with Grapheneos in Pixel 5 ?
10:54:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> firdeus[m]: hi, do you want to do screen recording?
10:55:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> There is a built-in screen recorder in quick settings tiles
10:56:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You need to "enable" it by dragging the needed tile in "tile customisations"
10:56:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚Äãengu_Gone_Complicated> No, he clearly said he wants to record calls
10:57:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, my bad(Screen recorder can do that tho
11:05:28 <firdeus[m]> I want call phone recorder not screen record.
12:07:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãhePrivacyStore> You can record the microphone and the device audio with screen record.  Then must rip the audio from the file.
12:08:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãhePrivacyStore> Most call record apps only work with standard calls anyway, calls with Signal etc won't be captured.   At least in my experience
12:08:24 <justcheckingout[> Hello, I am planning to install GrapheneOS on a non-supported device (old and non-pixel).
12:08:24 <justcheckingout[> How can I check if this might work? Like any requirements for the device to fulfil, other than RAM and free space?
12:08:24 <justcheckingout[> In case it does not work, or I mess up somewhere, is it possible to get the factory version of Android which came preinstalled on my phone?
12:09:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãhePrivacyStore> How do you intend to do that lol
12:10:03 <justcheckingout[> I am not sure, does it delete the factory image as well? üòõ
12:10:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãhePrivacyStore> The web installer won't allow you to install to a non supported device.  And flashing a .zip on a different phone is a great way to brick your phone
12:11:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <T‚ÄãhePrivacyStore> Unless you plan to take AOSP, and a ROM like Lineage and then the Graphene OS changes and mish mash them together üòÇ
12:16:38 <justcheckingout[> So no GrapheneOS on non-supported devices then?
12:18:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P‚Äãengu_Gone_Complicated> Yes
12:19:36 <justcheckingout[> Ok, My exact device is not listed under LineageOS either.
12:19:36 <justcheckingout[> Any other custom ROMs that I can try?

14:08:54 <flimsybenefit[m]> will the length of support for (e.g. pixel 3a) entirely depend on how long google supports it for or something else?
14:13:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> flimsybenefit[m]: correction, it depends on the "Google and Qualcomm agreement"
14:14:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> But yeah, that is the main factor when it comes to the length of support
14:14:27 <flimsybenefit[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> flimsybenefit: correctio"> is qualcomm's relevance this firmware thing i'm reading about on the website

15:44:20 <DoomDumas> Hi all, flashed my pixel 4a with grapheneOS, all went well.. a month later want to flash my friend's pixel and I've now a strange version of FASTBOOT.. any idea ?¬† I had v.30.x and now it's v.1:8.1.0+r23-5~18.04
15:45:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> DoomDumas: hello, just follow the web installer please
15:46:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
15:46:58 <DoomDumas> thank you.. I prefer to install manually, but my friend may be ok with the web installer
15:47:47 <DoomDumas> any know change in FastBoot in the last month ?¬† I saw something about 'illegal number'¬† wth ?
15:48:06 <DoomDumas> known*
15:52:36 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Possibly at some point, the $PATH in fastboot was unset, thus detecting the outdated version instead
15:52:52 <nscnt[m]> You've either installed the package provided by your distro (which is outdated) or you have installed something else from a third-party
15:55:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Hulk shared a photo on Telegram with caption: 'DoomDumas:'
15:55:41 <nscnt[m]> The official guide sets the path only for the current shell
15:55:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> 31.0.1 is the latest fastboot version at this point of time
15:56:37 <nscnt[m]> If you jump in in the middle, your environment probably won't be set up properly
15:56:55 <DoomDumas> Had installed the v.30 and adjusted the path, all went fine.. one month later, maybe because of a Ubuntu update, the fastboot version became messy.. I'll look forward at the PATH and try reinstalling fastboot..¬† thanks a lots.. I knew I would find the real king pins here... Thanks nscnt
15:58:26 <nscnt[m]> DoomDumas: Follow the guide from the beginning and you should be fine
15:59:44 <DoomDumas> nice,

16:20:58 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Been a while since I chatted on here, but still enjoying the project.  The old Samsung sees less and less use every day
16:32:45 <mr-president[m]> If I were to attempt to flash GrapheneOS on a phone with a locked bootloader, would there simply just be an error and there wouldn't be any harm done?
16:33:53 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It won't flash iirc
17:01:57 <phone[m]> <mr-president[m] "If I were to attempt to flash Gr"> it won't work, gos needs access to the bootloader and it must be unlocked first.  please see the instructions on installation https://grapheneos.org/install/
17:38:37 <Happ> Just to be sure, does flashing as described in the CLI install guide wipe every partition or whatever there can be on a phone, so that there cannot be any remainders of a previously installed potentially malicious/infected OS?
17:39:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The OS has to be wiped when you unlock or lock the bootloader

17:57:21 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not exactly "everything" as in all of stuffs, it's pretty much of what is documented there, some include "OEM unlocking off/on?", "Deny USB when unlocked off/on?", "Is user profile secure (with password/pattern/pin)?"

18:14:31 <just-a-bugger[m]> I know GrapheneOS sets some restrictions on stuff like USB behavior. I know it comes without many apps or services. But, compared to the preinstalled OS, does GrapheneOS _remove_ any functionality?

18:20:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> However, GrapheneOS does hide the calendar app icon because the aosp calendar app isn't very useful for an average user.
18:20:47 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: not an OS feature
