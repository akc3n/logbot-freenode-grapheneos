00:02:06 <akc3n[m]> guest12345467576: in system settings, apps and notifications, messaging, advanced, SMS app, what does it say?
00:03:46 <Marcelo> disculpa, pero quien aqui habla espa√±ol ??
00:06:07 <akc3n[m]> <Marcelo "disculpa, pero quien aqui habla "> un poco
00:06:22 <Marcelo> entiendo el idioma que hablan, pero en chatear algo en inglis nose!
00:06:29 <guest12345467576> it allows SMS messenger
00:07:03 <guest12345467576> I can set it to signal
00:08:10 <guest12345467576> still just sits on "we need to verify that you are human"
00:09:31 <Marcelo> por que quieren saber que uno es humano??
00:12:22 <akc3n[m]> <guest12345467576 "I can set it to signal"> Don't set it SMS default to signal.... Try verifying it with the call option. Also are you using Tor/orbot?
00:12:24 <akc3n[m]> <Marcelo "entiendo el idioma que hablan, p"> bien, tienes una pregunta?
00:12:53 <guest12345467576> doesn't have a verify call option
00:13:46 <akc3n[m]> <guest12345467576 "doesn't have a verify call optio"> It should after the timer runs out when you don't enter the verification code when they try to SMS text it to you.
00:15:21 <Marcelo1> como yo puedo confiar en ustedes que son personas. no unas maquinas que se escriben entre si???
00:15:34 <guest12345467576> ok, I will let the timer run out

00:19:56 <Marcelo1> pregunto: todos en este chat hicieron esa verificaci√≥n??
00:20:36 <Marcelo1> si la puedo hacer!
00:21:54 <akc3n[m]> <Marcelo1 "como yo puedo confiar en ustedes"> Contrariamente a la creencia popular, su cuenta de Signal no est√° vinculada a su n√∫mero de tel√©fono, sino a un n√∫mero generado autom√°ticamente llamado clave privada. Para que la aplicaci√≥n sea f√°cil de usar, esta clave privada o identidad criptogr√°fica se asocia con alg√∫n otro n√∫mero arbitrario que, de nuevo, por conveniencia, resulta ser un n√∫mero de tel√©fono. La
00:21:54 <akc3n[m]> la que es un n√∫mero de tel√©fono es para que el servicio de Signal pueda enviarte un c√≥digo de verificaci√≥n en un mensaje de texto durante el proceso de registro y registro de la cuenta.

02:26:55 <poizn[m]> You're welcome üôÉ
02:50:23 <loektiasop[m]> Does the camera app in GOS saves any (relevant) metadata? Or should i remove metadata on every image individual?
02:53:56 <skwisgaar[m]> loektiasop: The camera app is just the AOSP camera app, so it doesn‚Äôt behave differently than that. As for what metadata is saved I‚Äôm not sure. But it doesn‚Äôt sanitize the images.
02:54:40 <vata0[m]> So something like scrambled should be used correct
02:54:59 <loektiasop[m]> Are there any camera apps that don't save any metadata?
02:55:40 <loektiasop[m]> Would be a good longterm project for grapheneos. If i know how to code, I would start right now but i can't haha
02:56:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ùôπùôπùü∑ùü∂ùü∑ùüπ> vata0[m]: I usually do not use the camera unless I want to keep memories, so I save them in a safe place, such as an encrypted LUKS partition or an encrypted folder.

03:14:58 <tacticalnewfy[m]> Does this mean the phone can't be flashed it's still locked by the carrier
03:15:30 <someone-s11> Hello, and good evening
03:16:25 <someone-s11> I have installed latest stable release on pixel4a , I have a couple questions , and possible bug report or maybe I am doing it wrong
03:16:55 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: No, that just means the bootloader is locked. You will need to toggle the OEM unlocking permission in the operating system settings in order for it to allow you to unlock it using GrapheneOS.org's online installer.
03:17:07 <TheJollyRoger> someone-s11: ahoy! What can I do for ye, welcome aboard shipmate!
03:17:35 <someone-s11> 1. When I create another user/profile , I cannot then install apps under different user account,¬† for instance I have the owner account, then I create account named Dave
03:17:38 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: please read the directions in their entirety over on https://grapheneos.org/install/web
03:18:03 <TheJollyRoger> 1. Do you have any device administration apps installed?
03:18:45 <someone-s11> When I log in to Dave, i can't install apps there, it won't let me install fdroid*¬† ¬† ¬†I was under the impression that it's recommended to use a different profile for each service , or to enhance your privacy
03:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> If not, are you installing the same or a newer version, or the website release?
03:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> So, this is a common problem, but I'll tell you what causes it:
03:19:11 <someone-s11> I don't have any administration apps,
03:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so this is what's happening:
03:19:33 <someone-s11> Thanks for the help BTW :)
03:20:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, ye be welcome! The version on F-Droid.org's front page is actually very old, since they only wanted to GPG sign it once; they instead have you install an out of date version, which then self-updates to a newer version on first run.
03:20:32 <TheJollyRoger> To prevent downgrade attacks, Android does not allow you to install an older version of an app overtop a newer one. This applies even across profiles.
03:20:40 <someone-s11> That makes sense , I understand what you said* how to fix it
03:20:52 <TheJollyRoger> So this way, one profile can't be a newer version of the app than another.
03:21:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You'll have to go and download the up-to-date version of F-Droid, which is buried somewhere on their website.
03:21:34 <TheJollyRoger> This is so Owner can't be on Version 1.4, and Dave can't be on Version 1.3.
03:21:44 <someone-s11> OK! Will try asap*¬† after we finish talk, I'll try and do it then report back. Thanks
03:21:51 <TheJollyRoger> Dave must install Version 1.4, or later.
03:22:28 <someone-s11> 2nd issue, I cannot take a simple screenshot in vanadium (def browser) , this is with owner account
03:22:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I believe this is disallowed by policy.
03:22:59 <someone-s11> Thanks TJR, I will try it and come back to verify
03:23:02 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
03:23:15 <someone-s11> I tried to give vanadium all access, and it still won't screenshot
03:23:49 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: No, that just mea"> Thank you I wanted to double check. I have been following the steps in the install guide. I've re-read it about 10 times. When I got in and turn OEM unlocking. It still leaves that at locked.
03:23:51 <someone-s11> Screenshotting is very important , damn , sometimes you wanna clip "evidence". I do some conspiracy research
03:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Apps can choose to opt-out of screenshot security, but there is no toggle for it so it's just set to be on all the time.
03:24:39 <someone-s11> Can you recommend a decent browser that supports screenshot ?
03:24:41 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Yep, once you toggle OEM unlocking, that just enables bootloader unlocking, but it doesn't actually unlock the bootloader itself. For that, you must plug your phone in, get it to Fastboot, and run the unlock command on the website.
03:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> someone-s11: The only other browser we recommend here, is Bromite. The Bromite and Vanadium projects actually co-operate but they differ in some of their approaches they take to some specific issues around blacking advertisements and some approaches they take to browser fingerprinting. I can't tell you much more than that though.
03:26:24 <TheJollyRoger> Vanadium is more secure and leverages the memory safety improvements in GrapheneOS to more strongly provide isolation between sites though, which Bromite cannot do because Bromite must be able to run on operating systems that aren't GrapheneOS.
03:26:54 <someone-s11> Is there a simple way to edit the source code, to allow specifically vanadium¬† to allow screen shot ? I *might* be able to build from source
03:27:05 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: please read the d"> I just got a new device today... factory fresh. I skipped through all the start up and ran all the updates. installed nothing but the stuff on the phone to update it. I installed nothing then started the install guild. When I turn on dev options and enable the OEM and restart then go into fast boot is shows locked still, im stumped. I can factory reset again I
03:27:05 <tacticalnewfy[m]> guess
03:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> someone-s11: There is. Detailed build instructions are on https://grapheneos.org/build.
03:27:47 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Yes, because you need to actually issue the unlock command from the computer.
03:27:55 <someone-s11> Is there a way to allow screen shot, I don't know what code I would need to modify tho
03:27:56 <sphinx[m]> someone-s11: just use a normal tab
03:28:10 <sphinx[m]> someone-s11: Chromium's incognito mode disables screenshots
03:28:12 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: Yep, once you tog"> Let me run this longer... should I run ./adb devices first to make sure it sees the device?
03:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: No.
03:28:44 <someone-s11> Omg!!! You're a life saver sphinx , ty
03:28:50 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: adb is not used for installing GrapheneOS. If you are using or following a third party guide, STOP RIGHT NOW before you end up with a $400 paperweight.
03:29:21 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: I will walk you through it if you are unfamiliar.
03:29:42 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: adb is not used f"> Yeah let me just go back and start again. I'm following what you're saying. Thank you
03:30:01 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Ok, so... have you set the OEM unlocking toggle to "on"?
03:30:04 <someone-s11> I'm not a total noob. I hardware modded a thinkpad with ME cleaned, and heads boot w/qubes OS
03:30:16 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: Ok, so... have yo"> Correct
03:30:33 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Ok. I want you to unplug your phone briefly, and switch it off.
03:30:41 <someone-s11> From what I gather, graphene is the most secure mobile OS available
03:30:48 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <tacticalnewfy[m] "Correct "> Device is on, booted and I have set that setting. Yes
03:31:01 <sphinx[m]> someone-s11: so were you able to install F-Droid?
03:31:12 <someone-s11> Will try now, brb 5
03:31:20 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: Ok. I want you to"> Device is off and unplugged
03:31:46 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Great. I want you to press and hold VOLUMEDOWN, then press and hold and POWER until you get to that fastboot screen that shows you "locked."
03:32:11 <TheJollyRoger> Release them as soon as you see that screen, then I want you to plug your phone back into the computer, using the Google Branded USB C to USB C cable,
03:32:27 <TheJollyRoger> or an Anker or Aukey USB 3.1 Gen 1 or later A-to-C cable if available.
03:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure it's to a rear port of your desktop, if you are on a desktop. We've had a ton of bad experiences with front ports.
03:33:05 <TheJollyRoger> You're on Windows 10, or a different operating system?
03:34:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ùôπùôπùü∑ùü∂ùü∑ùüπ> Seems to me that dad will definitely not buy a G Pixel. I will have to get the money all by myself. Considering I am Venezuelan, 5$ in XMR seems like a good start to me. Now the question is how the heck am I going to get more without screwing up on crypto trade.
03:34:50 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, @!JJ1013.
03:35:14 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know what to tell you, I am not a cryptocurrency guy.
03:35:27 <TheJollyRoger> But I will wish you luck, we'll have our fingers crossed for you.
03:36:26 <someone-s11> I was not able to find the newer fdroid binary
03:36:48 <someone-s11> I tried to DL from github too, but it downloaded the old one
03:36:50 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: if you're on Windows 10, I want you to open up Edge in a non-InPrivate window, and go to https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader
03:37:10 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You're on Windows 10, or a diffe"> I am using the cord that came in the box the stock pixel cable. I did move it to a rear port that is a good point. So the device is plugged in and sitting at the screen saying "locked". I have the latest version of platform tools downloaded. I'm on windows 10.
03:37:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ùôπùôπùü∑ùü∂ùü∑ùüπ> TheJollyRoger: You mean Chromium Edge?
03:37:21 <sphinx[m]> <someone-s11 "I was not able to find the newer"> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid
03:38:12 <TheJollyRoger> @JJ1013 if you are on Windows 10, yes, you can use Microsoft Edge, which is based on Chromium and fully supports WebUSB to install GrapheneOS.
03:38:40 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: it's faster to simply use the webinstaller. That will allow you to do it by clicking the button.
03:39:16 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: the CLI method is only done for reverse compatibility and historical preservation purposes. It's faster, safer, and easier to simply use the graphical installer.
03:40:36 <tacticalnewfy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "tacticalnewfy: it's faster to si"> This is where is was trying to fix before I click the web button and I get the popup that says no device compatible device found.
03:40:57 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Yup, you're missing the driver. Go to Windows update and install optional updates.
03:41:01 <TheJollyRoger> Keep your phone plugged in.
03:41:14 <TheJollyRoger> And on Fastboot.
03:42:12 <TheJollyRoger> Remember: fastboot is the bootloader interface. Once the operating system is booted, the phone is no longer detected as an android bootloader interface and the operating system cannot be installed to it, nor can bootloader settings be changed or altered.
03:42:53 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: If you went ahead with the commandline installation method you'd get the same results, because you're missing the driver.
03:43:04 <TheJollyRoger> It would just give you "waiting for device" and nothing more.
03:43:09 <TheJollyRoger> Without that driver.
03:43:12 <someone-s11> It worked!!! Thank you sphinx and TJR
03:43:22 <TheJollyRoger> someone-s11: Yarr!
03:43:46 <someone-s11> I had to match the same version of fdroid and it works !!! Amazing work to all who help with graphene is
03:44:17 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo, glad to hear it! someone-s11, if you find GrapheneOS useful, please sling us something at https://grapheneos.org/donate - donations keep this ship sailing, so the project doesn't get polluted by for-profit interests.
03:44:34 <TheJollyRoger> There anything else I might be able to help you with?
03:45:10 <someone-s11> I should be using different accounts on the device , different profiles to seperate identity? Is it beneficial at all ?
03:45:54 <someone-s11> I will be donating something when I can*¬† spent $300 on ammo so I'm tapped out right now
03:46:27 <TheJollyRoger> someone-s11: Generally, that's how most people retain separate contextual identities, via profiles.
03:47:03 <TheJollyRoger> Each profile has its own specific contact list, its own list of apps, and interprocess communication across profiles is strictly forbidden.
03:47:39 <TheJollyRoger> The owner profile can toggle access to the phone and ability to send and access to SMS messages per profile.
03:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> So it's up to your owner profile as to whether or not you want to share the phone with them.
03:48:35 <TheJollyRoger> Profiles also have distinct and unique encryption keys, and you can use the GrapheneOS-specific "End Session" function on the lock screen to eject them from the memory when those profiles are not being used.
03:49:01 <someone-s11> Nice.¬† Got the phone "for free" through headset upgrade (pixel4a) , chose it because of graphene
03:49:07 <TheJollyRoger> Arr!
03:49:08 <tacticalnewfy[m]> TheJollyRoger: It's getting the patches now it's showing them that makes sense.
03:49:31 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Great. You may need to hotplug the device (unplug and plug it back in) after a reboot.
03:49:48 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Make sure adb server is NOT running when you attempt to do any web installer functions or it will fail.
03:49:53 <someone-s11> Are many of the devs in GTA area in Canada ? Or just the leader/creator
03:50:20 <TheJollyRoger> The developers are in their own respective locations.
03:50:24 <someone-s11> Just curious , don't take it the wrong way
03:50:29 <someone-s11> I'm in GTA area
03:50:32 <tacticalnewfy[m]> @thejo
03:51:22 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Yeah?
03:51:39 <tacticalnewfy[m]> TheJollyRoger: Yeah it's going to reboot... and I saw that running before in the task because I launched it. I think the issue was the driver this whole time where I was stuck.
03:52:04 <someone-s11> I guess I will just say thanks again guys , and shuffle away ,¬† ¬†don't think you'd appreciate it if I inserted my political opinions / conspiracy theories lol
03:52:08 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: yeah, you may be best off with simply restarting the computer, so it doesn't interfere.
03:52:26 <TheJollyRoger> someone-s11: Arr, fare thee well. We appreciate the discretion!
03:52:56 <tacticalnewfy[m]> TheJollyRoger: I will get the driver finished and reboot and pick backup and keep you posted. I really appreciate the help. Thank you for jumping in.
03:53:09 <someone-s11> Will come back to hang out sooner or later
03:53:10 <dannyknoll3Danny> @JJ1013 ADA (Cardano), FIL (Filecoin), LINK (Chainlink) all worth a look.
03:53:13 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: That be me job, me hearty! P.-)
03:53:24 <TheJollyRoger> Of course!
03:53:25 <someone-s11> Hope y'all have a great weekend
03:53:29 <TheJollyRoger> You too!
03:54:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ùôπùôπùü∑ùü∂ùü∑ùüπ> dannyknoll3Danny: Until now I am only interested in Nano and Monero. Filecoin seems too heavy for me, and ERC-20 tokens are no good IMO.
03:54:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ùôπùôπùü∑ùü∂ùü∑ùüπ> I have tried trading before... it was dissapointing
03:54:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ùôπùôπùü∑ùü∂ùü∑ùüπ> Off-topic.
04:05:31 <tacticalnewfy[m]> TheJollyRoger it's working... it's on to downloading the image and all green lights. I'll make sure to head over to the donations page! It was just the drive issue.
04:05:49 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Excellent, excellent!
04:06:00 <TheJollyRoger> tacticalnewfy[m]: Thank you in advance, and welcome aboard the ship!
05:51:38 <Jgem[m]> I've read a good few posts that seem to say grapheneos on the pixel 5 is more secure then any desktop Linux out there (except maybe intelligently setup qubes) ..  So is there a way safe way get the video out to a larger monitor to make the graphene pixel 5 in a more desktop .. Bluetooth mouse and keyboard but not sure how to get onto a monitor since I read the usb-c won't output to HDMI.  Or would it be more recommended
05:51:38 <Jgem[m]> to use something like scrcpy to control from Linux computer.. Just seems like that'd be worse for sure bringing the Linux computer into the mix.
06:10:39 <strcat[m]> you can use USB-C mouse/keyboard too
06:10:56 <strcat[m]> Jgem: we don't yet support video out on Pixels, it's unclear if we can
06:11:07 <strcat[m]> Jgem: someone interested has to work on it.
06:11:24 <strcat[m]> also we don't have the free form window mode and a large screen launcher, etc.
06:14:31 <Jgem[m]> If i can use USB c for mouse and keyboard at same time and just deal with small screen that still may seem useful to use the vanadium browser for some secure projects
06:15:19 <Jgem[m]> But have that nice keyboard and mouse to feel more I am sitting at my desk working at a computer and able to work more efficiently with those devices
06:36:11 <strcat[m]> Jgem: you can if you attach a USB hub
06:36:19 <strcat[m]> mouse/keyboard already work fine
06:36:23 <strcat[m]> bluetooth or USB-C
06:36:36 <strcat[m]> they can be USB-A themselves ofc
06:36:48 <strcat[m]> but video out is not currently supported
06:39:19 <Jgem[m]> Okay.. Still haven't really dove into grapheneos recommendations on Bluetooth, though I use it at times for pods and music.. Wired mouse and keyboard though seemed fine..   Video would be nice though... Need to find the perfect resolution rectangle magnifying glass ;)
06:47:32 <Jgem[m]> Thanks strcat..... And goodnight
06:48:03 <feedmeenergydrin> Hi there, I have a Pixel 3 that's been running GrapheneOS for a long time and kept up to date. I'm moving to a new device and giving this one to a friend, who also wants to run GrapheneOS. I would like to remove all traces of my usage from the device and give them a fresh slate - what is the best way to go about doing this, will performing a
06:48:04 <feedmeenergydrin> factory reset from Settings->System->Advanced->Reset options->Erase all data (factory reset) do what I want? :)
06:48:56 <strcat[m]> feedmeenergydrin: yes
06:49:14 <strcat[m]> feedmeenergydrin: and see https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption for more info
06:52:40 <feedmeenergydrin> "Deleting a profile will wipe the corresponding Weaver slot and a factory reset of the device wipes all of the Weaver slots." Super dumb question, but my reading of this is that after doing this, the fully patched GrapheneOS install will remain, and all that'll be needed is to set up a new profile, correct?
09:43:16 <Tifriis[m]> Hi all ! Little question, I try to use multiple users on my graphene. When i create a new user, i can't install new apps (fdroid for example).i have an error (installation failed (whereas I activited unknow sources)
09:48:06 <userx2020[m]> Hi guys, can you please give me a brief explenation about the security issues with non-pixel devices and lineage os compare to graphene?
09:48:06 <userx2020[m]> Thank you!
09:51:28 <sphinx[m]> Tifriis: That's happening because F-Droid has an outdated apk as the main download on their site. You can't install an older version on F-Droid than you have in 1 profile.
09:52:38 <Thatcher[m]> The latest apk IS on their site https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
09:52:53 <Thatcher[m]> Just not on their front page for some reason

10:41:18 <EinLurch> Hello everyone. I am trying to set up a fresh installation of GrapheneOS, and I wanted to follow the recommendations by it, meaning one owner and then another user for daily use. For my need, I need additional users, meaning
10:41:18 <EinLurch> owner -> user1, user2
10:41:19 <EinLurch> While the creation works, I am facing problems with the installation of apps. The apps used by user2 are a subset of user1's apps, and the owner doesn't need any.
10:41:19 <EinLurch> Now when I create both users, I go to user1, install the apps, goto user2, and suddenly: app was not installed. Going back to owner or user1 reveals, that I can't install apps there anymore either.
10:41:20 <EinLurch> So my question: what am I doing wrong?
10:44:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> I'm setting up two pixel 3a's with graheneos, the web installer was childishly easy, not so much so the actual user profiles and apps afterwards. I choose to keep things simple with only signal on the owner profile and then a selection of communication apps also used on calyxos on a secondary profile and a tertiary profile for anything financial. For fdroid and the vpn apps this already required 3x2= 6 manual installa
10:46:26 <EinLurch> f‚Äãlyingduckall, so you haven't faced any problems with the installation of apps? Have you managed to install the same app into two profiles?
10:52:41 <sphinx[m]> <EinLurch "Now when I create both users, I "> Be more specific, this part is confusing.
10:53:16 <catfish[m]> EinLurch: you need to install the same or newer version.
10:54:57 <EinLurch> sphinx, I got to Setting -> System -> multiple users -> add user twice
10:55:14 <EinLurch> catfish, that could partially be the problem, let me check
11:05:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> No problems, some annoyances like having to install fdroid from usbstick in all (3) profiles before updating because the version on their website is 1.10 while current is 1.11
11:07:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> To be more clear, all profiles first get a basic set consisting of fdroid, aurora and vpn apps
11:08:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> That is what is becoming quite tedious, so that's why I look for a _safe_ batch process
11:11:57 <EinLurch> Strange, this worked - I wonder why before it got so locked up I couldn't even install unrelated apps? Anyhow, this now works, so thank you catfish and flyingduckall
11:13:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> So my install order is:1 create all profiles2 install fdroid on all profiles from usb3 install risevpn, calyxvpn, orbot in all profiles4 start vpn set always on, start orbot set on demand (not at startup)
11:18:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> 5 set fdroid to use tor, again in all profiles6 install signal from aurora on owner profile7 install messengers and general apps in comms profile8 install finance apps in money profile
11:20:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> And when I discovered I could not add fdroid 1.10 from usb to the third profile, because it had already updated itself to 1.11, i had to delete fdroid on all profiles and reinstall from usb again, arghh
11:20:58 <EinLurch> sounds like fun
11:23:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Hope that helps someone, my original question was about what would help me ;-) I'm looking for the simplest but safe solution to do batch installing. And preferably using only the two pixel phones. I did not need anything else but a single usb disk up to here.
11:25:24 <EinLurch> you could do that with adb if you have a trusted computing device
11:31:40 <cklb> Hey guys, I got a question about the bundled vanadium browser, is this the right place to ask them? (I just got my first android phone and flashed graphene OS this morning, so please be gentle with me¬†;-) ¬†)
11:36:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> I'm sure it can be done but a) how and b) the extra computer. I was hoping to stay within  android / grapheneos completely.One way could be to set up an internal shared app repository and try to get fdroid to batch install from there with a script. but I'm not sure that the option to share user data between profiles has been 'hardenned' away
11:37:18 <EinLurch> cklb yes, it's part of GrapheneOS - but in general, directly asking without metaquestions gets faster answers
11:38:39 <EinLurch> flyingduckall I think you need the apk on your machine and then just "adb install apk" - there's also https://github.com/mvdan/fdroidcl
11:39:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Look here for 'Web browsing' https://grapheneos.org/usage
11:42:11 <cklb> Quoting form the browsing FAQ: "We recommend against trying to achieve browser privacy and security through piling on browser extensions and modifications. " Does this mean that the installation of extensions in vanadium is not supported as a design decision?
11:42:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Ah, that's interesting. Unfortunately I don't think it will (batch) install into profiles. Does it?
11:43:11 <cklb> Context: I wanted to install uMatrix which I'm using on my desktop and got quite used to.Btw, thanks for the hint I'll try to remember that.
11:44:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> uMatrix is EoL
11:44:22 <EinLurch> cklb I am pretty sure this was just intended as another jab at firefox and co. -¬† but add-ons are probably unsupported - at least I didn't figure out how to install ublock
11:44:49 <EinLurch> oh yes. umatrix fuctionality is inside ublock so umatrix was eoled
11:45:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N‚ÄãorwegianFrost> You can't install extensions in VanadiumThey're theater anyway and doesn't improve your privacy nor securityInstead they're even makes you unique and reduce security
11:49:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> I think installing a chromium fork like bromite or brave in a separate user profile behind an always on vpn is what is seen as the maximum security risk acceptable without undoing most of what grapheneos is offering in the first place. Other then that you can just as well stick with an unhardened os. That's about where the balance is at.
11:51:00 <cklb> Thanks for the extensive background information. I'm sorry; my intention was not to start some discussion about the reasonableness of extensions as such. So extensions are not supported at the moment and probably wont be in the future. This is quite deliberating as it proofs that I'm not just to stupid to get them installed.
11:51:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Specific question: can I share data between user profiles to set up a shared f-droid local repository?
11:54:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Safely I should add, without root of course.
11:56:23 <EinLurch> flyingduckall one last info which might help you: you can also just download the most recent version of f-droid from the website
11:56:33 <EinLurch> and compare their certs
11:56:48 <EinLurch> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/ see at the bottom "recommended"
11:57:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Ah, no you can't, the dl one is v1.10 while current is 1.11
11:57:28 <EinLurch> yes, at f-droid.org but not at the package itself, there you can download all version
11:57:35 <EinLurch> see the link I just sent
11:58:03 <EinLurch> versions*
11:58:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Well try dl it and install, that's what i did and the f-droid server served me the 1.10 instead
11:59:25 <EinLurch> yes again, if you go to f-droid.org and press "download" you get 1.10
11:59:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> I'll try, tnx
12:00:51 <EinLurch> GrapheneOS has posted somewhere they are working on a solution which enables a different way of obtaining apps. Excited to see where that goes, but I haven't seen any of the work in that direction, so maybe it's canceled by now.
12:02:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Ok, I happily stand corrected, latest official version right there ;-) That's one problem solved today.
12:03:17 <EinLurch> always happy to help!
12:06:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> On my regular pixel, i can create a share folder that is secured by a pin code, does that not exist on gragheneos?
12:07:29 <EinLurch> I don't know the answer but if it helps: I have read that user can be used for different identities so I'm gonna go ahead and say that I doubt something like this exists or would work.
12:07:29 <EinLurch> Don't take it for a fact though
12:08:27 <EinLurch> (" Profiles should be used when separate identities are desired. ", taken from the FAQ)
12:31:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Apfel (@W‚Äãiener_Apfelstrudel) has joined the Telegram Group!
12:53:36 <EinLurch> tasty
13:28:02 <dazinism> flyingduckall once they are installed if you update apps in one user profile they update everywhere. All profiles share one package manager which isn't really visible to users.
14:30:00 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.03.19.14 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.03.19.14
14:30:03 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1373279007312084997
14:30:15 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/m9818g/grapheneos_2021031914_release/
14:34:06 <strcat[m]> latest release is pretty nice
14:34:15 <strcat[m]> added back a lot of past things
14:34:30 <strcat[m]> and there are some nice new things like 48-bit address space, connection partitioning for Vanadium, etc.
15:00:14 <blacklight447[m]> Nice
15:00:30 <blacklight447[m]> Also i read something about a camera and microphone indicator
15:00:51 <blacklight447[m]> Is it something similar to what ios does?
15:10:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It is
15:11:02 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It shows a camera or microphone icon on status bar when either are being used
15:14:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Indeed, and a good thing it is,...
15:19:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Still, I like the fact I didn't need a PC to do the grapheneos install so easily with only two original pixels side by side. So now I'm looking for ways to keep it that way and still make the profile specific app installation less tedious and error prone as well.
15:21:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> We don't recommend adb really
15:21:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Hi Daniel, is it correct there can not be a shared folder between profiles on GrapheneOS? To put a common f-droid local repository on for instance.
15:27:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> I appreciate that, so now I am trying to stick with using an usb-stick as an repository and getting f-droid to download to it somehow, from _within_ GrapheneOS.
15:28:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> In a sense I think there is a security benefit too, not having to download every app for every profile for every phone again.
15:30:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> But since there is a new version, I'm going to study the change log first, I noticed there is some attention to the topic of app installation already, who knows what is there now.
15:31:45 <strcat[m]> there isn't shared data / communication across profiles aside from via the network
15:32:08 <strcat[m]> you can share files via networking through localhost
15:47:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Tnx, either usbstick or localhost it is. Someone should invent a usb-c stick as small as the receptor.
15:49:56 <strcat[m]> good luck getting it back out after putting it in
15:52:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> I'd love to sketch you a micro push and release mechanism for that, but it's weekend, have great day and thank you for GrapheneOS.
15:55:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Upgraded OTA without noticeable issues. Anything you want to have checked maybe?
15:56:06 <colest[m]> Little late to the party here but bluetooth issues people were describing that feedback was requested for sound like this notorious issue
15:56:06 <colest[m]> https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/151033055
15:56:06 <colest[m]> Willing to bet money the person that reported Bluetooth not enabling was on a Pixel 3. It's an upstream (possibly hardware) issue. It breaks wifi too and I deal with it all the time.
15:57:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Needs google account?
15:57:25 <m2tu[m]> I need help  ,  i wnat to add a app to build program folger and be able for user to uninstall it ? is it possible to add some code somewhere?
15:59:17 <colest[m]> Google issue tracker requires you to log into a google account to view it.
15:59:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Pixel 3a Bluetooth was enabling before and is enabling now. Does that help.
16:00:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Not my piece of cake at the moment. A quick summary?
16:02:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Should I move to matrix btw, is that the preferred channel?
16:08:30 <cstrrider[m]> So looking through the changelog what are app freezers, app compaction, and camera/microphone indicators?
16:12:56 <strcat[m]> camera/microphone indicators show when those are being used (can only be used by a foreground app with the permission granted)
16:13:03 <strcat[m]> similar to the traditional location one
16:13:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> I'm not Daniel
16:13:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> You can tag strcat if you want Daniel
16:14:20 <LinusSexTips[m]> clannad is anupritaisno1 right?
16:14:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> Yes/no
16:14:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> @clannad is anupritaisno1 with an identity crisis
16:14:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's true
16:15:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <f‚Äãlyingduckall> Thx, I know.
16:15:03 <LinusSexTips[m]> I understand
16:15:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> Well some nazi group on telegram stole my username
16:15:22 <strcat[m]> cstrrider: app compaction / freezer will reduce resource usage particularly memory which is helpful
16:15:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> And I haven't been able to get it back
16:15:42 <strcat[m]> compaction reduces memory usage, freezer reduces CPU usage
16:16:05 <strcat[m]> for cached / idle apps
16:17:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "compaction reduces memory usage,"> How so btw
16:17:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I thought compaction was just making free memory contiguous?
16:17:45 <strcat[m]> reducing memory usage to a minimum
16:19:23 <cstrrider[m]> <strcat[m] "camera/microphone indicators sho"> Thanks I see it now in the status bar nice!
16:19:59 <cstrrider[m]> <strcat[m] "cstrrider: app compaction / free"> Cool thanks
16:20:01 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: GC heap compaction makes a new heap, locks the existing one, moves all data over to the new one
16:20:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so there are no longer a bunch of gaps from freed things that aren't reused yet wasting memory
16:20:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Makes sense
16:20:35 <strcat[m]> can easily reduce memory usage of GC heap by 50%
16:20:56 <strcat[m]> a major issue we have right now is that the slab quarantine for hardened_malloc inherently has to use a lot memory
16:21:02 <strcat[m]> but we could potentially make it lighter
16:21:12 <strcat[m]> really important security feature
16:21:21 <strcat[m]>  * a major issue we have right now is that the small allocation quarantine for hardened_malloc inherently has to use a lot memory
16:22:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: we really should find a hardware partner soon
16:22:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> We could avoid this problem by shipping the maximum (16gb atm) RAM on phones
16:23:17 <strcat[m]> not really the place to talk about that
16:23:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
16:23:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just saying
16:24:11 <strcat[m]> malloc_trim could be made more aggressive to try to free a lot of fully quarantined slabs in the background
16:24:27 <strcat[m]> more concerned about finding someone to implement memory tagging support ASAP
16:24:59 <fybb> Is the ConnectivityManager in GrapheneOS modified compared to stock AOSP in someway? Have an issue where VPN networks are left in a disconnected state after the device returns from standby (the VPN is up, but the network isn't registered with the ConnectivityManager and thus not available when the WebRTC API enumerates local candidates for example)
16:27:07 <strcat[m]> fybb: no
16:27:43 <m2tu[m]> What about screen recorder on pixel phone ? can google in theory remote start screen record and get taht data back ?
16:27:49 <strcat[m]> fybb: are you comparing to modern AOSP, to the stock OS or something else?
16:28:06 <strcat[m]> m2tu: been through this stuff before with you
16:28:11 <strcat[m]> m2tu: stop the concern trolling here
16:28:23 <m2tu[m]> or any app using screen recorder as reference
16:28:52 <m2tu[m]> im not rolling im just coursios .. this is not about graphene os its included in all pixel phones
16:29:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> m2tu: only privileged apps can really record stuff otherwise some apps can use the cast screen feature afaik, maybe I'm wrong
16:29:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> But if an app does that you'll see a cast icon on your notification bar
16:29:54 <m2tu[m]> ok thanks :)
16:30:00 <strcat[m]> obviously an app cannot just record the screen...
16:30:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also really if you are asking this question
16:30:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then you have a trust issue with the OS itself
16:30:55 <m2tu[m]> yeah im not speaking about GrapheneOS .. its the android code it self
16:31:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> In that case don't use stock
16:31:25 <m2tu[m]> and reacted to becuase i could not delte screen recorder from build
16:31:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't get your weird logic
16:31:39 <strcat[m]> obviously an app can't just record the screen on the stock OS either
16:31:56 <strcat[m]> not something GrapheneOS has to change...
16:32:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And why does it have to be the recorder app? They could add the feature in the system itself if they wanted to
16:32:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you have a trust issue with the stock OS then you can't just go and blame some random app for it
16:32:31 <strcat[m]> don't think that's what they're talking about
16:33:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "don't think that's what they're "> Essentially they are misunderstanding what a system app does and don't trust their base system
16:33:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> In that case they should use something else
16:33:45 <m2tu[m]> yea thats true
16:34:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway this is off topic
16:34:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
16:34:27 <neverfinished[m]> Questions about Vanadium are on topic?
16:36:06 <m2tu[m]> anyhow.. is it possible to let user uninstall prebuild apps taht i add to build ?
16:37:25 <strcat[m]> they can disable them
16:38:04 <dannyknoll3Danny> neverfinished: Yes
16:40:40 <fybb> strcat[m]: Have only tested with GrapheneOS, haven't had the chance to test with other OS or devices yet. The setup is identical to this issue https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/issues/4022 (not me reporting there)
16:41:42 <fybb> The author claims that the issue isn't present with a stock redmi device
16:41:44 <strcat[m]> sounds like a network issue or VPN issue
16:41:47 <strcat[m]> not a GrapheneOS or app issue
16:41:58 <strcat[m]> something you need to debug yourself
16:42:20 <strcat[m]> reporting it won't lead anymore, problem is specific to your setup, not caused by OS/app
16:42:30 <strcat[m]> carrier, network, configuration for VPN, don't know what the issue is
16:42:34 <strcat[m]> something you have to figure out
16:44:25 <fybb> strcat[m]: the VPN is up, I can send/receive traffic over the interface. But, the VPN-network isn't registered within the ConnectivityManager which is used by the WebRTC. If I toggle the VPN, logcat displays that the network is picked up by ConnectivityManager and WebRTC works again.
16:45:13 <fybb> However, I do not know if it is Graphene related, just wanted to see if there are any modifications related to the ConnectivityManager that I could look at
16:48:35 <strcat[m]> no, there aren't any
16:48:43 <strcat[m]> there aren't any relevant changes at all
16:48:46 <strcat[m]> to any of that kind of thing
16:48:58 <strcat[m]> it's extremely unlikely that it's anything to do with GrapheneOS
16:49:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> fybb: what vpn app?
16:49:29 <fybb> anupritaisno1[m]: wireguard
16:49:36 <strcat[m]> fybb: btw there are not broadcasts from that to apps passively listening to them anymore
16:49:37 <strcat[m]> that's normal
16:49:46 <strcat[m]> if an app wants those it has to actively listen, not passively via manifest
16:50:00 <strcat[m]> that's a standard Android change on more recent versions to avoid waking up a ton of apps on every network change
16:50:08 <strcat[m]> and by more recent... that probably means years ago
16:50:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <fybb "anupritaisno1: wireguard"> Play Store version?
16:51:07 <fybb> anupritaisno1[m]: No, f-droid
16:51:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fdroid one is often buggy/outdated
16:51:54 <fybb> anupritaisno1[m]: ok, could try and build it manually to make sure it is up-to-date
16:52:07 <strcat[m]> please use the offtopic channel for it

16:52:18 <strcat[m]> not a GrapheneOS issue
16:54:22 <neverfinished[m]> <dannyknoll3Danny "neverfinished: Yes"> I have another question. Right now my local language is en-US but my time zone is Europe/"city". This make me stand up more? Should i use the same language of my country?
16:58:25 <m2tu[m]> Where is the GraphoneOS bootanimation coded file located ...  i want to replace it with my personal text ?
16:59:51 <strcat[m]> same as AOSP
16:59:57 <strcat[m]> we don't use a bootanimation atm
17:00:06 <strcat[m]> frameworks/base
17:00:09 <strcat[m]> either way
17:00:28 <somenerd[m]> I believe that it's just an image
17:01:13 <m2tu[m]> frameworks/base  , guess it vectorized text
17:01:21 <m2tu[m]> i tryed to find without sucess
17:15:24 <kokoto[m]> <strcat[m] "cstrrider: app compaction / free"> is something similar to SuperFreezZ app from f-droid?

17:33:19 <Guest23989> i'm using grapheneos.org/install/web instructions, got to unlocking the bootloader, but there is no information on the webusb-based installer
17:35:10 <strcat[m]> kokoto: has little to do with what sketchy third party apps may do
17:35:25 <strcat[m]> it uses the Linux kernel cgroup freezer feature
17:39:16 <kokoto[m]> <strcat[m] "it uses the Linux kernel cgroup "> thanks for the anwser
17:42:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Guest23989 "i'm using grapheneos.org/install"> That website is the installer
17:43:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> The next part is pretty much below it: "Obtaining Factory Images"
17:52:52 <Guest23989> The website is the installer?
17:54:00 <ulmirdin[m]> Yes
17:54:11 <strcat[m]> Guest23989: http://grapheneos.org/install/web is the installer, it has the buttons to perform the install there
17:54:24 <strcat[m]> make sure to use a high quality USB cable and supported browser/OS
17:55:52 <Guest23989> ok, i got it, hiding in plan sight, thanks for your help, much appreciated
17:57:18 <southwest[m]> Latest beta - did 64-bit address space make it to the 3a ? or was the graphics driver too messed up?
18:05:10 <strcat[m]> southwest: had to skip 48-bit address space on 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL
18:05:29 <strcat[m]> southwest: also may have to disable it on future devices because it kinda conflicts with taking advantage of pointer authentication... but for now it's nice to have
18:05:40 <strcat[m]> since pointer auth isn't supported on ARMv8.2
18:06:13 <southwest[m]> Understood. Just checking. Thanks for your dedication. Hopefully 5a soon.
18:18:48 <rhythm[m]> <strcat[m] "and there are some nice new thin"> Whai is this?

18:26:22 <emilsp> hey, what date is my pixel 3 getting EOL'ed?
18:27:16 <poisonoushydra[m> emilsp: https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en
18:28:06 <emilsp> gah, so I have until October to save up money for a pixel 5? This is some serious suck, but this suck is by no means the fault of grapheneOS.
18:29:57 <emilsp> In other bugs, is there any way I can get more debug info around not connecting to 5ghz WiFi networks? All I see is that there's a deauth event and not much else.
18:32:12 <strcat[m]> or buy a 4a / 4a (5G)
18:32:53 <strcat[m]> 5a will be out around August, maybe if people help substantially and people seriously step up as a maintainer (which actually involves doing a lot of work consistently, and is a long term commitment) it could be added back
18:32:59 <strcat[m]>  * 5a will be out around August, maybe if people help substantially and people seriously step up as a maintainer (which actually involves doing a lot of work consistently, and is a long term commitment) it could be added quickly
18:38:24 <emilsp> I have built a custom AOSP once for fun and profit, but that was years ago. For now, I'm looking for a daily driver device, and I assume working on Graphene would imply having a separate development phone or a lot of time spent restoring backups.
18:39:47 <emilsp> What sort of experience do most GrapheneOS devs have in common?
19:16:47 <LinusSexTips[m]> they all have robotic implants so that they may forgo sleep

20:05:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> hello guys
20:05:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> is GrapheneOS good enough against SS7, Silent SMS, IMSI catcher etc attacks?
20:07:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> @acegeorge https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
20:07:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
20:07:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> These issues are due to weaknesses in cellular networks
20:07:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> rip
20:07:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Avoid using sms or trusting your network
20:08:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is nothing grapheneos can do to fix this
20:08:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> with silent sms u dont do anything
20:08:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> if u get targeted i mean
20:08:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> its silent
20:08:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> i was looking at this https://esdcryptophone.com/product/cryptophone-600g/
20:08:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> What silent sms
20:08:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <a‚Äãcegeorge> but its too damn pricey and everyone has to have it

20:18:37 <poisonoushydra[m> That Cryptophone says it is based on Windows... so six years obsolete now?
20:23:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <D‚Äã4v1dH> Hi all I have installed the Google Camera app from aurora store on GrapheneOS but it is not working. It stucks at a screen with a camera logo in the middle for 5+ minutes, what is going wrong?

20:31:11 <Privacy> im having problems downloading the GrapheneOS onto my Pixel 5 5G 2021 model im stuck in fastbootd right now does anyone know what to do?
20:33:15 <strcat[m]> Privacy: make sure you don't have adb running (not supposed to use it at all)
20:33:21 <strcat[m]> Privacy: make sure you're using a reliable USB cable + port
20:33:55 <strcat[m]> Privacy: use the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes with the device or a high end USB-A to USB-C cable (some random Amazon one will likely be broken)
20:34:14 <strcat[m]> Privacy: also use https://grapheneos.org/install/web if you aren't (or follow the *official* CLI guide, NOT a third party one)
20:34:47 <Privacy> im stuck half way through the flash realse can i restore the phone?
20:35:32 <strcat[m]> the phone is fine
20:35:36 <strcat[m]> the flashing can be stopped and restarted at any point
20:35:47 <strcat[m]> follow advice above
20:36:06 <strcat[m]> at any point during flashing, you can stop, and it's fine, there's just no OS installed, not an issue
20:37:23 <Privacy> i have 4 options which one should i do :reboot system now, enter recovery, reboot to boatloader, power off
20:40:43 <strcat[m]> Privacy: you can just go to the web installer and do flash and it'll handle it for you
20:40:48 <strcat[m]> download -> flash
20:40:57 <strcat[m]> Privacy: reboot to bootloader is what you need to do but web installer will do that for you
20:41:18 <strcat[m]> Privacy: make sure you don't have an adb daemon running in background
20:41:25 <strcat[m]> reboot is easy way to make sure
20:41:56 <Privacy> what is a adb daemon?
20:42:06 <Privacy> thank you for your support!
20:43:03 <poisonoushydra[m> Android Debug Bridge... basically how your computer communicates with the device.
20:49:57 <strcat> Privacy: if you didn't do anything with an adb cli command don't worry, not an issue
20:50:13 <strcat> adb isn't used in either of the official installation methods
20:50:44 <strcat> but when people launch it via cli, it ends up running a background service which tries to stay connected to the device and can break other stuff connecting
20:51:20 <Privacy> ok i used the website mention above so is that ok?
21:00:12 <Privacy> im recieveing error 10000 ms exceeded?
21:04:23 <strcat> Privacy: sounds like a faulty USB connection
21:04:34 <strcat> Privacy: try different USB port, USB cable, etc.
21:04:42 <strcat> ideally use one that came with the device
21:04:49 <strcat> g2g for now

23:09:09 <jenkei[m]> Hey guys, was wondering if anyone has any performance comparison of graphene on the pixel 4 vs pixel 5, as i‚Äôm considering which one to buy
23:10:20 <jenkei[m]> Even from a theoretical standpoint with regards to the increased cpu in pixel 4 as opposed to higher ram on pixel 5
23:10:55 <mynacol[m]> <jenkei[m] "Hey guys, was wondering if anyon"> Pixel 5 will get a year more (security) updates
23:11:28 <mynacol[m]> jenkei: Also consider the Pixel 4a (4G and 5G)
23:11:51 <jenkei[m]> Ive also heard that graphene is really heavy on the battery so the increased battery of the 5 would be of benefit
23:12:15 <mynacol[m]> https://endoflife.date/pixel
23:13:21 <mynacol[m]> <jenkei[m] "Ive also heard that graphene is "> Don't see why Graphene would have increased battery consumption
23:14:51 <jenkei[m]> <mynacol[m] "Don't see why Graphene would hav"> Ive heard that the hardened malloc and the isolation/sandboxing take up more resources in the background which is why the charge doesn‚Äôt last as much as on stock android
23:15:39 <jenkei[m]> Could be wrong though, I was just under the impression that I read this somewhere
23:17:08 <mynacol[m]> jenkei: Graphene requires more RAM because of that. CPU and battery are not significantly more used
23:18:09 <jenkei[m]> So I suppose the increased ram of pixel 5/4a5g would also show increased performance relative to 4
23:18:48 <jenkei[m]> Im not intending to make heavy use such as games, but it would be nice for the ui to be as smooth as possible
23:19:12 <mynacol[m]> jenkei: Not directly "performance", but more how many apps can stay opened in the background
23:19:44 <mynacol[m]> <jenkei[m] "Im not intending to make heavy u"> Don't worry. The phones are still fast
23:20:05 <jenkei[m]> Perfect, thank you very much for the feedback
23:20:55 <jenkei[m]> Im coming off an iphone 8 so really don‚Äôt know what to expect, my only experience with android is on low end devices and the glitchy ui really turned me off
23:22:00 <mynacol[m]> <jenkei[m] "Perfect, thank you very much for"> My pleasure
23:23:31 <jenkei[m]> Of course I understand that ux should be the least of my concerns when making the consideration to switch to graphene, but it‚Äôs a nice bonus :p
23:41:03 <justawfulgamer> has anyone been able to get cashapp to work?
23:43:21 <entry1[m]> <justawfulgamer "has anyone been able to get cash"> Was told it isn't compatible and doesn't have browser capability. Also, you can ask any questions about app compatibility etc. in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
23:45:21 <justawfulgamer> that's a bummer
