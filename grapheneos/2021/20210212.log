00:01:45 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: sounds like your USB connection is bad
00:01:45 <mr_hebi_san[m]> LOL it really was the cable.  I switched to an old beat to shit cable that needed a USB c adapter
00:01:47 <strcat[m]> the cable should be fine
00:02:10 <Bret19> I'm new here, apologize got a dumb question, pixel 5 supported or even in beta testing yet?
00:02:12 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Maybe it was the specific port?
00:02:15 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: maybe it wasn't pushed in all the way etc
00:02:22 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: yes often specific ports on the computer are bad
00:02:27 <strcat[m]> Bret19: it's in internal testing
00:02:31 <strcat[m]> Bret19: it's not ready for public use
00:03:21 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Good to know.  Now that I think of it, when I flashed the 4a I think I did use a different usbc port than I tried a moment ago.  can't quite remember.
00:03:22 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Anyhow it's workin now üëçÔ∏è

00:27:56 <cankerwort[m]> Hello. Is ADB disabled by default in GOS?
00:28:18 <cankerwort[m]> I cannot see the toggle anywhere in Settings
00:28:21 <strcat[m]> cankerwort: it's disabled by default on Android
00:28:26 <strcat[m]> cankerwort: why are you trying to enable it?
00:28:33 <strcat[m]> it's intended for development
00:28:47 <cankerwort[m]> I'm not, I'm wanting to check that it is disabled
00:28:59 <strcat[m]> developer options are disabled by default
00:29:13 <strcat[m]> the install guide recommends temporarily enabling them to turn off OEM unlocking and then disabling them again
00:29:14 <TheJollyRoger> cankerwort[m]: by default, USB debugging on GrapheneOS is switched off. If you want to use it, you'll need to enable it the way you normally would. If you don't see it, it's not switched on.
00:29:36 <strcat[m]> for adb to be enabled you would have had to enable developer options and then enable adb
00:29:45 <strcat[m]> it's disabled by default on Android in general
00:29:54 <TheJollyRoger> *If you don't see it, debugging options are not switched on.
00:30:05 <TheJollyRoger> Gah, sorry,
00:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> **If you don't see it, developer options are not enabled, and you'll need to enable them to get access to the menu.
00:30:22 <cankerwort[m]> OK thanks for the clarification
00:30:23 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that.
00:30:39 <SkyKing> hey hey hey
00:30:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
00:31:16 <SkyKing> I bought a verizon locked pixel 4a off craigslist today. didn't think I'd be fucked after being with them for like 16 years
00:31:33 <SkyKing> am I screwed? they said I have to wait 60 days to unlock if that matters
00:31:55 <TheJollyRoger> SkyKing: Even if you unlock the carrier, the bootloader is likely permanently locked and you cannot unlock it.
00:32:09 <SkyKing> ahhhhhhh
00:32:30 <SkyKing> at least it only cost me 260
00:32:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
00:33:06 <SkyKing> tried all the tricks I could find, even the remove user0 one I expected to be patched anyway
00:33:38 <SkyKing> are most of you guys logged in on matrix and bridged here?
00:33:50 <SkyKing> per the [m]'s I'm seeing
00:34:27 <cankerwort[m]> <strcat[m] "the install guide recommends tem"> To confirm, "OEM Unlocking" should be set to off for everyday use?
00:34:42 <TheJollyRoger> cankerwort[m]: yes, OEM unlocking should be set to "off"
00:35:33 <strcat[m]> cankerwort: it's not very important but there's lower attack surface with it off
00:36:27 <TheJollyRoger> SkyKing: Several of us use Matrix, but I prefer IRC for various reasons.
00:36:55 <TheJollyRoger> A few of us still also hold out on IRC because unfortunately we've had some issues with Matrix, one way or another.
00:37:05 <cankerwort[m]> It seems I had left it on, so thanks for pointing that out.
00:37:52 <strcat[m]> it's low importance
00:37:57 <strcat[m]> but it's better for it to be off
00:37:59 <strcat[m]> and then disable dev options again
00:38:06 <SkyKing> matrix is way better than it used to be but man buggy as hell
00:38:30 <TheJollyRoger> SkyKing: yeah :(
00:38:39 <strcat[m]> the concept of it is good
00:38:44 <strcat[m]> the implementation needs... a lot of work
00:39:09 <strcat[m]> the main issue we have with it is the IRC bridge kicking all matrix users who don't talk for 30 days
00:39:12 <strcat[m]> then they get pissed at me
00:39:16 <strcat[m]> thinking we kicked them
00:39:20 <strcat[m]> but the bridge does it and we can't stop it
00:39:32 <SkyKing> admins are running wild with censoring, too
00:39:35 <strcat[m]> they fixed it to only kick users who are actually idle
00:39:43 <strcat[m]> but then didn't ship the fix
00:39:52 <strcat[m]> for matrix.org
00:39:53 <strcat[m]> due to performance overhead
00:39:59 <rny> SkyKing: what do you mean admins are running wild with censoring
00:40:08 <rny> as in homeserver operators?
00:40:21 <SkyKing> they defederate memerooms and acl ban homeservers all the time
00:41:20 <rny> SkyKing: and you dont think that is part of content moderation?
00:41:29 <rny> how do you stop abusive contents from coming through?
00:41:50 <SkyKing> which sucks because matrix.org is most accessible and vast right now but for example a lot of guys in #tech:glowers.club can't access grapheneos:matrix.org
00:42:06 <rny> if homeservers are incapable of self-moderating, then obviously other homeservers need to ban/de-federate
00:42:22 <SkyKing> you expect a hobbyist hs admin to control everybody that accesses your hs?
00:42:49 <rny> its their HS, so they have a responsibility to content moderate their HS
00:43:00 <SkyKing> too high a bar but to each their own
00:44:08 <SkyKing> I work 40hrs/week +family +hobbies. bs if some dickhead abuses my hs and because I have a 3hr window to deactivate servers I can't access the entire matrix.org community
00:44:22 <rny> irc users are subject to similar constraints, to participate in an irc server, you need to comply with the moderation policy.
00:44:44 <SkyKing> I understand moderation
00:45:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys. OT chat exists
01:42:01 <MrJack> is the iommu in non-pixel phones good enough or are the pixels the only ones with effective iommu? Just trying to make sense of this as a layperson.
01:54:24 <strcat[m]> MrJack: depends on the phone, the main issue is not that IOMMU isn't good enough but that it isn't all set up correctly
01:54:40 <strcat[m]> MrJack: it is one of many things that needs to be properly set up
01:55:47 <strcat[m]> the main issues with other devices are lack of consistent security updates, lack of support for hardware-based security features with alternate OSes, lack of a secure element providing the StrongBox keystore + Weaver + the other APIs and a general lack of care / attention for security that leads to not setting things up securely and not caring to fix it
01:56:09 <strcat[m]> and the OS cannot resolve those issues
01:56:38 <strcat[m]> anything with a Snapdragon SoC has proper IOMMUs but that does not mean it is set up correctly for components
01:56:57 <strcat[m]> an IOMMU that is configured to allow a component access to all memory isn't doing any good
02:10:33 <Joe38> Hello, getting "no compatible device found" when attempting the web install
02:10:43 <Joe38> Device is a Pixel 4a
02:11:04 <Joe38> Developer mode open, OEM unlocking enabled
02:14:02 <strcat[m]> Joe38: and is it booted into the bootloader interface?
02:14:14 <Joe38> Yes
02:18:07 <strcat[m]> Joe38: and which OS are you using for flashing
02:18:53 <Joe38> Windows 10, only because the install guide did not specifically list Linux Mint
02:19:09 <strcat[m]> Joe38: did you check Windows Update optional updates
02:19:16 <strcat[m]> for bootloader interface driver
02:19:18 <strcat[m]> check that now
02:21:09 <Joe38> Can't seem to find "optional updates" anywhere
02:23:42 <strcat[m]> Joe38: press check for updates
02:23:49 <strcat[m]> it should show optional updates below
02:24:15 <Joe38> It didn't but I found out why, the button for downloading related updated was turned off, I turned it on and am now downloading the bootloader
02:25:22 <Joe38> Thanks for the help, will check back if needed
02:28:12 <MrJack> @strcat so I assume then that those cheap shovelware android brands probably don't have iommu configured correctly if they have the right hardware at all.¬† could one then expect better supported phones like the sony xperias for ex to have iommu configured correctly?¬† from what I've read their phones are supported with updates for multiple years,
02:28:13 <MrJack> and they provide open device support with builds for aosp and mainline linux.¬† then again, to my knowledge they don't support custom verified boot, so maybe they aren't so security conscious after all.
02:28:31 <strcat[m]> they do not provide everything required
02:28:54 <strcat[m]> no secure element, lack of hardware-based security features with an alternate OS, lack of consistent security updates at the proper schedule
02:29:16 <strcat[m]> they have great support for using AOSP sure, but not as a secure production installation
02:29:31 <strcat[m]> and they're lacking in hardware / firmware security overall
02:29:39 <strcat[m]> if they corrected those issues then sure we could consider supporting one
02:37:03 <MrJack> shame, their phones are really good otherwise.¬† I guess other flagships probably aren't too much better either since planned obsolescence is how they make money.
02:54:44 <Joe38> Is there a way to validate the os if I don't have graphene on any other devices?
03:01:23 <strcat[m]> Joe38: Auditor doesn't require GrapheneOS
03:01:24 <strcat[m]> you can install it on another Android device
03:01:24 <strcat[m]> there's also https://attestation.app/
03:21:07 <iantucenghi[m]> Guys, stupid question but is Pixel 4a 5g supported by Graphene OS? Sorry if this is a stupid question. Thank you.
03:21:24 <somenerd[m]> no
03:21:38 <somenerd[m]> not yet, at least
03:21:47 <iantucenghi[m]> Okay. I will wait. Thanks.
03:21:53 <somenerd[m]> there is a beta channel
03:21:58 <somenerd[m]> though there may be bugs
03:23:28 <iantucenghi[m]> Sadly this is my only phone so I can't beta test. Sorry but maybe in the future I can help Graphene more when I get another pixel But I will support
03:23:29 <iantucenghi[m]> financially
03:25:24 <strcat[m]> there are bugs
03:25:26 <strcat[m]> working on one right now
03:25:41 <iantucenghi[m]> Thank you.
03:27:41 <strcat[m]> there are highly experimental Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 releases
03:28:28 <iantucenghi[m]> I will check them out. Thanks again.
03:38:21 <Joe38> Thanks all for the assistance, up and running and looks great.
03:47:33 <take_a_deep_brea> great ! welcome to graphene !
04:30:53 * disciple69[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oPuqcHacwIbWbriYrlUneeAV/message.txt >
04:32:28 <take_a_deep_brea> disciple69:  try using the web installer
04:32:42 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.com/install/web
04:34:42 <disciple69[m]> When I try to use the web installer it is telling me that no compatible devices are found.
04:35:34 <disciple69[m]> When I did it using terminal I was able to unlock the boot loader, download the version for the 3a and unzip
04:36:00 <strcat[m]> disciple69: make sure to read the information there about flashing as non-root
04:36:01 <stencil[m]> You gave browser USB permission right?
04:36:18 <strcat[m]> disciple69: have you dealt with https://grapheneos.org/install/web#flashing-as-non-root ?
04:36:23 <strcat[m]> stencil: there's no such thing on desktop OSes
04:36:32 <strcat[m]> stencil: that's only when flashing from another Android device
04:37:02 <strcat[m]> desktop OSes lack a security model for applications so the browser can always access USB devices
04:37:10 <strcat[m]> the issue on Linux is that udev is busted by default
04:37:24 <strcat[m]> and doesn't permit local users to access local devices without setting up rules for each
04:37:41 <strcat[m]> due to security theater
04:38:04 <disciple69[m]> Haha well no I didn‚Äôt do that
04:38:11 <disciple69[m]> I wasn‚Äôt aware that was a thing
04:39:00 <strcat[m]> you might have done part of the CLI stuff as root instead of dealing with it
04:39:09 <strcat[m]> I recommend using the web installer
04:39:22 <strcat[m]> you aren't on a distribution where there's a good reason to use the CLI approach
04:39:56 <floramike[m]> I have this OS on my phone already, but I was wondering if it could theoretically be installed on an Android tablet?  If not, what would be the closest thing? Anyone  know?
04:40:07 <take_a_deep_brea> <strcat[m] "you aren't on a distribution whe"> lol , true
04:40:11 <somenerd[m]> no, I don't think so
04:40:16 <somenerd[m]> at least officially
04:40:45 <disciple69[m]> Ok so I need to figure out how to grant access to Chromium
04:40:50 <take_a_deep_brea> floramike: it involves significant  effort to get this OS to work on a different smartphone
04:41:34 <floramike[m]> Is there a similar OS for tablets?  Scrapes the Google out?
04:42:02 <take_a_deep_brea> there are plenty of custom ROM's out there
04:42:23 <take_a_deep_brea> but none are upto scratcg
04:42:28 <take_a_deep_brea> *scratch
04:42:52 <floramike[m]> Hmm. That's disappointing.
04:43:18 <take_a_deep_brea> floramike:  which tablet is this ?
04:44:54 <floramike[m]> I was thinking of buying one, but currently none.
04:45:10 <take_a_deep_brea> suggest buy an ipad
04:45:31 <take_a_deep_brea> great security and reasonable amount of privacy
04:45:44 <grabba[m]> I'm having memory issues with using a user profile . is an app freezer recommended?disabled admin network connections which run in background and ate bandwidth
04:46:01 <take_a_deep_brea> its the best alternative to graphene on a recent pixel
04:46:09 <grabba[m]> Or should I manually stop each app?
04:46:36 <take_a_deep_brea> grabba: no i dont think an app freezer will ever be recommended , sadly .
04:46:53 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah manually disable
04:46:53 <grabba[m]> I figured so
04:47:03 <grabba[m]> Kk thank you
04:47:17 <take_a_deep_brea> never trust an app to do what you can do yourself
04:47:49 <disciple69[m]> <strcat[m] "disciple69: make sure to read th"> And yes I did run this step
04:48:07 <floramike[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "suggest buy an ipad"> Well, the thing is I am trying to move away from Apple lol
04:48:48 <take_a_deep_brea> well , if you care about security thats the wrong way to go , lol
04:49:05 <take_a_deep_brea> sad but true
04:49:46 <floramike[m]> Trying to distance myself from big tech (Google, Apple, Microaoft, etc.). Easier said than done.
04:50:31 <take_a_deep_brea> true . why dont we move this conversation to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  ,  if you dont mind ?
04:51:43 <floramike[m]> Fair, although I think I'm going to hop off now anyway.  Thanks for responding.
04:52:35 <strcat[m]> there isn't a tablet meeting our requirements
04:52:50 <strcat[m]> so, there is nothing comparable for tablets, and cannot be, without a new tablet that meets the requirements
04:52:52 <strcat[m]> and then we could support that
04:53:04 <strcat[m]> we used to support the Nexus 9 a long time ago
04:53:17 <strcat[m]> of course, it's far from meeting the current standards, and obviously has been end of life for a long time
04:54:22 <strcat[m]> EOL was in 2016 iirc
04:54:31 <somenerd[m]> would be cool if they made a Pixel tab
04:54:39 <somenerd[m]> don't think Google will though
04:54:46 <strcat[m]> they have, none have met our requirements
04:54:56 <somenerd[m]> odd
04:55:00 <take_a_deep_brea> pixelbook?
04:55:11 <take_a_deep_brea> ok slate
04:55:12 <strcat[m]> none of them have ever met our requirements
04:55:24 <somenerd[m]> doesn't support flashing alternate avb keys afaik
04:55:28 <somenerd[m]> (Pixelbook)
04:55:51 <strcat[m]> it's not an Android device in the first place and Chromebooks don't have the same quality of alternate OS support
04:55:58 <somenerd[m]> > none of them have ever met our requirements
04:55:58 <somenerd[m]> a GrapheneOS tab would be cool, but yeah, sad that none support the requirements
04:55:58 <take_a_deep_brea> true
04:56:00 <strcat[m]> Pixel C was an Android device and didn't meet our requirements, as I said
04:56:38 <strcat[m]> it's simple: if it doesn't meet the basic requirements (which have been stated many times at a high level), no support for it will be considered
04:57:01 <strcat[m]> if people want a tablet to be supported, then they'll have to convince a company to make a tablet meeting the requirements
04:57:01 <somenerd[m]> yeah the problem is on Google
04:57:02 <strcat[m]> our focus is on finding a hardware partner to make a phone, not a tablet
04:57:07 <somenerd[m]>  * yeah the problem is on Google's side
04:58:23 <strcat[m]> if it was a small tablet then it's just be like adding another phone, device support stuff
04:58:38 <take_a_deep_brea> never liked that form factor ,
04:58:49 <strcat[m]> if it was a large tablet we'd probably want to deal with getting free form window mode working as an option and we'd need a tablet oriented launcher
04:59:03 <strcat[m]> so that is more than just regular device maintenance
04:59:14 <strcat[m]> AOSP's launcher is trash for a large tablet
05:00:14 <strcat[m]> there are no tablets coming close to meeting our requirements and no reason to think that there ever be in the near future though
05:00:24 <strcat[m]>  * there are no tablets coming close to meeting our requirements and no reason to think that there will ever be in the near future though
05:01:25 <strcat[m]> and it wouldn't really be any easier to make a tablet meeting our requirements than a phone
05:01:34 <strcat[m]> I mean if you put a phone SoC in the tablet it is basically a phone...
05:01:41 <strcat[m]> just a really big one
05:01:49 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
05:02:04 <strcat[m]> a Wi-Fi only tablet wouldn't be any easier to make
05:02:32 <somenerd[m]> well, would be cool to have another option for a secure OS in that form factor
05:02:46 <strcat[m]> atm an iPad is the only option
05:02:55 <somenerd[m]> but, well, google doesn't care for some reason
05:03:00 <somenerd[m]> (or even other vendors)
05:04:21 <strcat[m]> other vendors should be perfectly capable of making a device that properly supports alternate OSes, ships the monthly security updates, has 3-4 years of support, has the hardware set up securely and has a good secure element providing the APIs used by AOSP
05:04:28 <somenerd[m]> and getting GrapheneOS ported would (as you already mentioned) need a few UI tweaks and a new launcher
05:04:39 <somenerd[m]> > other vendors should be perfectly capable of making a device that properly supports alternate OSes, ships the monthly security updates, has 3-4 years of support, has the hardware set up securely and has a good secure element providing the APIs used by AOSP
05:04:40 <somenerd[m]> yeah but they don't for some reason
05:04:41 <strcat[m]> there is no particular reason that Google has to make a tablet for there to be a tablet that meets our requirements
05:04:52 <strcat[m]> somenerd: yeah but for tablets, Google hasn't done it either, after the Nexus 9
05:05:01 <strcat[m]> Pixel C didn't support verified boot for an alternate OS properly
05:05:06 <somenerd[m]> yeah, I mean, they were the only one that cared
05:05:07 <strcat[m]> because it was supposed to be a ChromeOS device
05:05:12 <strcat[m]> then got switched to Android
05:05:16 <somenerd[m]> for a normal phone
05:05:19 <strcat[m]> and they didn't end up doing the usual support for alternate OSes
05:05:24 <somenerd[m]> so that's why I mentioned them as an option
05:05:32 <strcat[m]> it had the lackluster Chromebook support for alternate OSes
05:05:35 <strcat[m]> rather than Pixel phone style
05:05:40 <somenerd[m]> > and they didn't end up doing the usual support for alternate OSes
05:05:40 <somenerd[m]> maybe in the future ig
05:05:45 <strcat[m]>  * rather than Nexus/Pixel phone style
05:05:53 <somenerd[m]> maybe one that uses the Mac option?
05:06:05 <somenerd[m]> for desktop?
05:06:09 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
05:06:14 <strcat[m]> anyway there is no tablet available for us
05:06:20 <somenerd[m]> yeah it's irrelevant for GrapheneOS
05:06:23 <strcat[m]> and no reason to think that Google will ever make a Pixel Tablet for Android
05:06:37 <strcat[m]> and little reason to think other vendors are going to start caring about making secure devices or about proper alternate OS support
05:06:49 <strcat[m]> most of the people interested in running an alternate OS don't care if it's insecurwe
05:06:52 <strcat[m]>  * most of the people interested in running an alternate OS don't care if it's insecure
05:07:00 <strcat[m]> so that is what they give you
05:07:44 <somenerd[m]> > most of the people interested in running an alternate OS don't care if it's insecure
05:07:44 <somenerd[m]> I mean, most people don't want to run an alternate OS
05:07:46 <strcat[m]> so, unless it's a hardware vendor wanting to talk
05:07:50 <strcat[m]> it isn't an interesting conversation
05:07:58 <strcat[m]> and our focus would be a phone, not a tablet
05:08:00 <somenerd[m]> so it's a small percent of a small percent of people
05:08:22 <strcat[m]> I pretty much think there's a near 0% chance of a hardware vendor making a non-Pixel device that meets our very basic and meagre requirements
05:08:29 <strcat[m]> UNLESS we are working with them
05:08:35 <strcat[m]> and they understand what our requirements are and want to provide it
05:09:16 <strcat[m]> so, don't get your hopes up that there is ever going to be the shortcut of some vendor deciding to make a device that's as secure as a Pixel / iPhone let alone one that allows you to install an alternate OS in a secure way that has all the same hardware-based security features available to it
05:09:29 <somenerd[m]> well, seems like high hopes for a non-Pixel device supported (without a partnership)
05:09:31 <strcat[m]> the way to achieve that is working with hardware partners
05:09:43 <strcat[m]> clearly, there aren't vendors interested in providing this on their own
05:10:00 <strcat[m]> no reason to think there will be
05:10:23 <somenerd[m]> true, no one has really shown interest
05:10:26 <strcat[m]> not an interesting conversation and not a conversation I want to have with anyone but a hardware vendor or a company with a bunch of funding
05:10:31 <strcat[m]> companies have shown interest
05:10:33 <strcat[m]> and I am talking to them
05:10:41 <somenerd[m]> huh, sounds really cool
05:10:45 <strcat[m]> companies have not shown interest in making what we need on their own without our involvement
05:10:57 <strcat[m]> there is no reason to think a company like Sony is simply going to start caring about security one day
05:11:01 <strcat[m]> and make a secure device
05:11:08 <strcat[m]> consumers don't care
05:11:10 <strcat[m]> why would they?
05:11:27 <strcat[m]> most of the people asking for device support don't care even though they want to use GrapheneOS...
05:11:29 <somenerd[m]> yeah, and even people who want to flash an alternate OS don't care much
05:11:47 <somenerd[m]> > most of the people asking for device support don't care even though they want to use GrapheneOS...
05:11:47 <somenerd[m]> probably since they don't get the point
05:12:36 <strcat[m]> if we have better devices that were broadly available we wouldn't bother supporting future Pixel phones anymore
05:12:44 <somenerd[m]> (ex: thinking it's an alternative to less secure ROMs instead of a privacy and security focused)
05:12:46 <strcat[m]> I don't think people understand that broad hardware support is counter to our goals
05:12:58 <strcat[m]> we want to make a secure device, not make some existing device less bad
05:13:12 <somenerd[m]> yeah since they think that it's similar to LineageOS or something, when it clearly isn't
05:13:27 <strcat[m]> if we have a hardware partner that ends up doing a good job then don't expect us to support future Pixels
05:13:57 <somenerd[m]> since Pixels would be worse in comparison? or too much work?
05:14:03 <somenerd[m]> guessing the former
05:14:09 <strcat[m]> I would happily only support devices that are at least as secure as Pixels and built to run GrapheneOS as the stock OS
05:14:35 <somenerd[m]> yeah, since that would remove the "alternate OS" thing
05:14:42 <strcat[m]> and we would have more control
05:14:49 <somenerd[m]> and remove the flashing requirement
05:14:53 <somenerd[m]> for new users
05:16:09 <strcat[m]> we could also try to get the full 4 years support out of them by aligning them with the SoC release cycle properly (ideally that grows longer) and only release a phone every 2 years, not each year
05:16:23 <strcat[m]> 1 phone per 2 years
05:16:42 <somenerd[m]> 4 years of support and GrapheneOS hardware sounds really cool
05:16:56 <strcat[m]> ideally the SoC support will keep growing to 5, 6, etc.
05:16:59 <somenerd[m]> I've heard you say that you may keep supporting Pixels anyway
05:17:18 <somenerd[m]> due to Pixels being more common
05:17:26 <strcat[m]> somenerd: yeah but as I said above
05:17:36 <strcat[m]> if our devices were broadly available in sufficient numbers
05:17:48 <strcat[m]> we stop having a reason to support Pixels with official releases
05:17:55 <strcat[m]> it's still useful to support them as development phones
05:18:21 <somenerd[m]> yeah, and maybe require building
05:18:27 <strcat[m]> imo it is in the interest of a hardware vendor that wants to make an actual secure phone to work with us
05:18:31 <entry1[m]> 4 years support would be great. Google is keeping the software updates limited to 3 years definitely to incentivize upgrading devices. Unless they increase prices on their phones or face tremendous pressure, it is unlikely they will ever be on par with Apple as far as updates are concerned.
05:18:31 <strcat[m]> and actually deliver that instead of trash
05:18:36 <somenerd[m]> lol
05:18:38 <strcat[m]> usually they just make trash
05:18:59 <strcat[m]> entry1: it is not Google doing that at all
05:19:06 <strcat[m]> they don't earn any significant money from selling phones
05:19:13 <somenerd[m]> Qualcomm is doing that afaik
05:19:13 <strcat[m]> they would happily support them for 6 years
05:19:25 <somenerd[m]> they impose that restriction or something
05:19:49 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm provides at most 4 years of support and that assumes you are a close partner + launch with the SoC platform launch
05:20:05 <strcat[m]> Google does not align their phone releases with Qualcomm SoC platform cycles
05:20:18 <strcat[m]> Google launches their main phones around October
05:20:27 <strcat[m]> and then a budget one for that SoC platform halfway through the year
05:20:37 <strcat[m]> so the SoC platform is up to a year old when they launch
05:20:48 <strcat[m]> it is the newest SoC platform
05:20:52 <strcat[m]> but it is not brand new
05:22:03 <entry1[m]> <strcat[m] "they don't earn any significant "> Interesting. I was under the impression that the devices are subsidized with lower prices in order to gain more marketshare for Google services, which would increase their ad revenue etc. That is interesting you brought that up that it is a Qualcomm issue.
05:22:32 <strcat[m]> it's a SoC and hardware component vendor issue
05:22:33 <strcat[m]> in general
05:22:34 <strcat[m]> how long do you think the Wi-Fi card in your laptop is supported with security updates?
05:22:38 <strcat[m]> or the motherboard?
05:22:40 <strcat[m]> probably not 3 years
05:22:56 <strcat[m]> we won't support an insecure device
05:23:28 <strcat[m]> (unless it's a macbook or chromebook)
05:23:55 <somenerd[m]> how come? (the last Macbook and Chromebook part)
05:24:11 <strcat[m]> because they actually take responsibility for what they delivered and provide updates for all of it
05:24:16 <strcat[m]> for a given amount of time
05:24:45 <strcat[m]> as opposed to not really doing that in the first place, and at best releasing some updates for a couple years for a subset of it
05:25:05 <strcat[m]> and a lot of the time that's not automatic
05:25:16 <strcat[m]> and there's a safe assumption that few people install it manually
05:25:23 <strcat[m]> so it often doesn't even work right...
05:25:53 <strcat[m]> motherboards not meant to ship within an OEM computer are often even way worse
05:25:59 <strcat[m]> i.e. a standalone one you buy
05:26:26 <take_a_deep_brea> @strcat:matrix.org:  what about windows ?
05:26:35 <somenerd[m]> he's talking about hardware
05:26:44 <somenerd[m]> specifically, Macs and Chromebooks
05:26:50 <somenerd[m]> the OS isn't too relevant here
05:27:30 <strcat[m]> maybe there are Secured-core PCs other than Surfaces with decent support, don't know
05:27:46 <strcat[m]> if you want a general rule if it's not a Surface the security / support is probably trash
05:28:20 <entry1[m]> Well it does deal with the security updates for the hardware, which the vendor doesn't update. So in a way it is a firmware issue, just not the OS's fault.
05:28:22 <strcat[m]> Secured-core is a baseline standard that deals with some things
05:28:39 <strcat[m]> doesn't deal with the vendor providing proper support for it
05:28:46 <strcat[m]> which includes choosing components that are properly supported
05:28:58 <entry1[m]> It is really indecent for people to blame OS lack of support on Google than Qualcomm
05:29:17 <strcat[m]> I mean they could pay Qualcomm to provide longer support
05:29:19 <strcat[m]> and they probably would
05:29:22 <entry1[m]> * It is really indecent for people to blame OS lack of update support on Google than Qualcomm
05:29:26 <strcat[m]> but Google hardly sells any phones compared to major hardware vendors
05:29:54 <strcat[m]> the cost of getting them to do it may be more than the profit they earn from selling devices...
05:30:16 <strcat[m]> Pixels are like 1% market share in the US, less internationally? can't expect Pixels to fund Qualcomm LTS support
05:30:27 <strcat[m]>  * Pixels are like 1% market share in the US, less internationally? can't expect Pixels to fund Qualcomm SoC LTS
05:30:40 <entry1[m]> <strcat[m] "and they probably would"> But they would sell less phones potentially in the short term I presume from not releasing as many new models and look "antequated" in terms of continual aesthetics that dumbasses care about so much
05:30:58 <entry1[m]> Instead of what matters
05:31:04 <strcat[m]> entry1: again, they don't have a business based around selling new hardware
05:31:50 <strcat[m]> and Qualcomm would no doubt happily provide longer support if paid to do it
05:32:11 <strcat[m]> it does not in any way imply that they would earn less money
05:32:30 <strcat[m]> the premium can be built into the price of phones, some vendors would pay, some wouldn't, users don't care so it isn't a thing
05:33:04 <take_a_deep_brea> its crazy but samsung is in such a good position to do all this ... and yet it represents the worst of the lot
05:33:05 <strcat[m]> some devices have gotten a really long amount of support
05:33:11 <strcat[m]> look at NVIDIA's Android TV device
05:33:24 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: they do have devices that get 4 years of support
05:33:33 <strcat[m]> they have way too many devices tho
05:33:38 <strcat[m]> and way too much bloat
05:33:50 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
05:34:00 <take_a_deep_brea> its ridiculous
05:34:07 <somenerd[m]> don't have alternative OS support either
05:34:36 <somenerd[m]> surprising that a lot of companies can keep alternative OS support and have 4-5 years of support
05:34:40 <somenerd[m]> just choose not to
05:35:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> Isn't is an extra cost to do 5 years?
05:35:33 <hypokeimenon[m]>  * Isn't it an extra cost to do 5 years?
05:35:45 <somenerd[m]> it is
05:35:49 <somenerd[m]> I said that they can
05:37:09 <strcat[m]> it's entirely possible for an OEM to do an experiment like selling 2 versions of the same phone, one that costs $25 more, and it gets 4 years support instead of 2 years and is sold as a long term model, and then actually have data on whether people want that
05:37:17 <strcat[m]> my guess: they hardly sell any
05:37:47 <take_a_deep_brea> youmeant 25 or 250 ?
05:37:48 <strcat[m]> the cost of the SoC is something like $20 so raise that to $40 and that's easily enough money to cover 6 years of support or w/e
05:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> I'm guessing that the reason they don't go for longer than 3 is because most users simply trade their phones back in once they pay off their phone tab.
05:37:57 <strcat[m]> I meant $25 more
05:38:05 <take_a_deep_brea> nvm
05:38:17 <strcat[m]> that's like paying double for a flagship SoC
05:38:32 <strcat[m]> more than enough for them to support it 6 years and they would happily do it
05:38:37 <strcat[m]> they wouldn't earn less money
05:39:14 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: phones have a race to the bottom on pricing, other than iPhones
05:39:46 <TheJollyRoger> Most of the type of people that I know that fit the average user demographic and aren't in financial desperation, usually will do this, they'll simply pay off their tab, and then trade their phones back in after about a year, to around a year and a half, so they can get the cash incentive to count toward the next model.
05:40:09 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: that's why Qualcomm doesn't make a higher end SoC with a better CPU, that's why they don't provide more than 4 years support, etc.
05:40:22 <somenerd[m]> iPhones also have amazing support
05:40:30 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
05:41:04 <strcat[m]> somenerd: and it's a pretty hard counter to the claim that a vendor won't provide long-term support because they are so desperate to sell new devices
05:41:08 <strcat[m]> that longer support and retaining value is part of why people buy iPhones
05:41:49 <Leroy135678546> hi
05:41:55 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
05:42:02 <take_a_deep_brea> hallo
05:42:13 <somenerd[m]> hello
05:42:27 <Leroy135678546> any new updates soon?
05:43:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> Seems a bit chicken and egg.
05:43:32 <Leroy135678546> chickens lay eggs
05:43:46 <strcat[m]> Leroy135678546: no, not updates for non-experimental devices at least
05:43:57 <Leroy135678546> ok thanks strcat :-)
05:44:54 <strcat[m]> this month is focused on 1) dealing with the escalating attacks on the project by a malicious company, 2) Pixel 4a 5G / 5 support, 3) Auditor improvements (at least figuring out what new useful keystore features are available), 4) started eSIM activation app work
05:45:00 <strcat[m]> not going to be a month with a lot of OS improvements
05:45:09 <hypokeimenon[m]> When I was younger, I think I remember it being more the case that people would buy a phone and keep it for a long period of time if it worked well. I don't know if this was just the people I was around though.

05:45:59 <hypokeimenon[m]> Then all of a sudden everyone was 'on contracts' and using 'contract phones', getting a deal for a specific amount of time with a phone and data plan and then trading it in in some short amount of time.
05:46:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "When I was younger, I think I re"> Time and place effect that.  Definitely, with old flip phones and brick phones people often just kept them until their contract was up with their carrier or until they broke
05:46:57 <strcat[m]> I mean... I switch to a new flagship phone every year, and that's entirely separate from the pile of phones next to me for GrapheneOS development
05:47:03 <mr_hebi_san[m]> A lot of it is what you can afford you know?
05:47:17 <mr_hebi_san[m]> And your lifestyle
05:47:34 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "I mean... I switch to a new flag"> Right, but you have special interest.

06:04:20 <Jenna784> man copperhead is just a pain in the ass
06:04:41 <Jenna784> why dont they just leave graphene alone?
06:04:49 <Jenna784> dont waste any money with that guy
06:05:16 <Jenna784> block him, he can eat bugs and worship graphene
06:05:59 <figbert> I asked a bit ago, but didn't get a response ‚Äì anybody know if I can develop for mainline Android while running Graphene?
06:06:24 <strcat> figbert: sure, shouldn't cause any issues, as long as you're not trying to make stuff using Play services
06:06:38 <strcat> figbert: you can test in the emulator too anyway
06:07:12 <strcat> figbert: just don't depend on stuff like Sensors / Network permissions existing
06:07:24 <strcat> that we add
06:07:32 <strcat> but mostly we don't add stuff apps can use as APIs
06:07:35 <strcat> other than those at least
06:08:14 <figbert> strcat: What the extent of lack of Sensors / Network? Current app uses both the accelerometer and internet. Not too familiar with permissions on Android
06:08:36 <strcat[m]> figbert: I mean that on the stock OS / AOSP, there are no runtime permissions for Sensors / Network
06:09:00 <strcat[m]> so don't write code that checks if you have the permissions and requests them unless you have them not existing on Android
06:09:06 <figbert> Got it, got it
06:09:21 <strcat[m]> figbert: Android (any variant) doesn't have those permissions (vendors are forbidden from adding new core permissions or changing how they work)

08:17:52 <zvl12[m]>  * question about wifi calling : to be able to function it needs to be integrated by Graphene : is this something complicated or is it a security issue ?
08:19:08 <strcat> it's supported for some carriers already
08:19:29 <strcat> if it doesn't work for your carrier, they probably require a proprietary app for it
08:19:49 <zvl12[m]> what about t-mobile ?
08:20:18 <zvl12[m]>  * what about t-mobile ? if i put the tmobile sim into any wifi capable phone, it will work
08:20:48 <zvl12[m]> or does t mobile require a properietary app ? I dont think so but not sure
08:20:56 <strcat[m]> yes, they require a proprietary app
08:21:01 <strcat[m]> possible it works without it
08:21:08 <strcat[m]>  * they use a proprietary app
08:21:32 <zvl12[m]> <strcat[m] "yes, they require a proprietary "> if it work, i should see wifi calling option in the graphene menu ?
08:21:53 <strcat[m]> we don't include the extended carrier configs for most US carriers atm because they depend on at least one proprietary app
08:22:01 <strcat[m]> zvl12: not necessarily
08:22:06 <strcat[m]> zvl12: only if it's meant to be a toggle
08:22:13 <strcat[m]> VoLTE and VoWiFi aren't really that different
08:22:15 <strcat[m]> both are data-based
08:22:32 <strcat[m]> it's more about whether the carrier wants to let you do that
08:22:41 <strcat[m]> and whether they want to require some special app to activate it
08:22:45 <strcat[m]> and control who gets to use it
08:23:18 <strcat[m]> US carriers are the only ones around the world that tend to have stuff like not working without proprietary apps
08:23:20 <strcat[m]> unique thing in the US
08:23:22 <strcat[m]> just how it is
08:23:45 <zvl12[m]> <strcat[m] "and control who gets to use it"> any unlocked phone i put my tmobile sim into, it works, and i am using phones purchased outside the US, it works as long as the phone has the capability, but not every phone has it

08:28:37 <zvl12[m]> I can confirm that Wifi calling is working perfectly on Graphene with a US T-mobile sim

08:46:35 <strcat[m]> Auditor app version 24 released: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/24
08:52:32 <randomdude8192[m> Cool
08:58:31 <antifasupersoldi> Yo people. I want to use GrapheneOS, but I had to settle installing CalyxOS because I wasn't able to get my VPN to work over the phone hotspot on Graphene. Did I do something wrong? I use Mullvad on my phone hotspot, so that when I connect my laptop to the hotspot, it's also connected to Mullvad.
08:59:08 <strcat> antifasupersoldi: it works the same way as AOSP / stock on GrapheneOS, you're meant to use a VPN on the other devices
09:00:06 <strcat> that way the hardware offload works and you have granular control over the VPN endpoints for each device
09:00:52 <strcat> we'd be fine with supporting an opt-in for using the VPN for tethering/hotspot but that's not how it works on Android and for good reason, and it wouldn't be the default on GrapheneOS, just a toggle
09:01:11 <strcat> seems like a poor reason to use an OS without the privacy/security hardening in GrapheneOS but you do you
09:01:22 <strcat> and please don't promote projects that support harassment of our developers here, thanks
09:01:43 <antifasupersoldi> Before I bought a pixel device, I used LineageOS on a Galaxy S5, and it also let me do the VPN over hotspot. I'm not critiquing GrapheneOS at all. I live the project. Just wasn't sure if I was missing something on my end.
09:02:12 <strcat> the feature comes from LineageOS and the implementation is flawed so we won't simply reuse their code
09:02:22 <strcat> it also isn't something we want as a default
09:02:24 <antifasupersoldi> Sorry, didn't know about the rocky relationship.
09:03:04 <strcat> we think it's a better idea not to associate your devices together rather than letting each get a different VPN endpoint
09:03:49 <antifasupersoldi> If I use Mullvad on my phone and on my PC separately, will Mullvad still be active on my phone on GrapheneOS when I activate the hotspot?
09:04:01 <strcat> yes
09:04:10 <strcat> it just doesn't send tethered / hotspot traffic through it
09:04:17 <strcat> it sends all the OS traffic through it
09:04:29 <strcat> it still works fine while using tethering/hotspot
09:04:33 <antifasupersoldi> Okay, most likely switching back to GrapheneOS soon.
09:04:35 <strcat> but it treats that as separate
09:04:50 <strcat> I can see why someone would want to send tethered traffic through the VPN
09:05:04 <strcat> but there is also good reason to not want that: hardware offload and more granular VPN endpoints/control
09:05:27 <strcat> the OS doesn't actually have to be awake to handle tethering / hotspot normally
09:05:33 <strcat> but with that change, it does
09:05:39 <antifasupersoldi> Sorry again about bringing up the other project. I honestly wasn't aware they've been harassing GrapheneOS devs. I know about the idiots at Copperhead but I haven't heard about Calyx, my bad.
09:06:36 <strcat> antifasupersoldi: they aren't doing it themselves but rather have promoted someone doing it, and taken full advantage of their attacks on GrapheneOS including harassing/bullying developers and spreading false info
09:06:44 <antifasupersoldi> Now I know the reason why I couldn't figure it out though, Google searches didn't help me much. Thanks for the quick replies.
09:06:56 <strcat> and they have taken advantage of people spreading false info like falsely claiming that their OS is a fork of ours
09:07:02 <strcat> so, due to these kinds of things, we're on bad terms
09:07:21 <strcat> they also retaliated against us for us daring to simply talk about how they've been doing this
09:07:30 <strcat> for example, these messages I just sent
09:09:00 <lodtank> just wondering: can someone tell me the differences between calyxos and grapheneos?
09:09:19 <somenerd[m]> offtopic and doesn't really belong here imo
09:09:58 <antifasupersoldi> I also wanted to ask, because now I'm worried my phone could be compromised using Calyx, but I understand it's off topic.
09:10:01 <strcat> lodtank: https://grapheneos.org/features - we have these features improving privacy and security, and we don't include / use Google services
09:10:30 <lodtank> i'm already using graphene right now, just wondering as i read about calyxos here a few times the last days
09:10:34 <lodtank> was new to me
09:10:50 <antifasupersoldi> They are both recommended on privacytools.io
09:11:06 <somenerd[m]> don't have similar goals though
09:11:32 <antifasupersoldi> Yeah, GrapheneOS is the most secure and private
09:11:54 <antifasupersoldi> While Calyx seems to be if you want to compromise and use microg and gapps.
09:12:11 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/features is what differentiates us from AOSP and other AOSP-based OSes
09:14:23 <lodtank> thx guys
09:15:11 <antifasupersoldi> Off topic again, but I'll stop after this question. I'm new to Matrix, I'm using Element. How come some groups have shields over the logos?
09:18:10 <strcat[m]> antifasupersoldier: the web client doesn't show that for me, maybe the client you're using (Android one?) uses it to show if it's end-to-end encrypted
09:18:29 <strcat[m]> this room is public so end-to-end encryption wouldn't make sense and would just add friction
09:18:41 <somenerd[m]> ?
09:18:42 <antifasupersoldi> Ahh, okay. Makes sense.
09:18:45 <strcat[m]> it's also bridged to IRC which doesn't have end-to-end encryption
09:18:48 <somenerd[m]> did I miss a message?
09:18:54 <somenerd[m]> oh wait nvm
09:19:09 <somenerd[m]> yeah nvm saw the message
09:19:24 <strcat[m]> antifasupersoldier: and btw there's #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org where there's no problem asking all kinds of questions like those
09:20:48 <strcat[m]> time to test web install for 4a (5G)
09:21:45 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
09:24:55 <antifasupersoldi> I wish I held off buying the Pixel 4a for the 4a 5G. Was too impatient.
09:25:55 <take_a_deep_brea> antifasupersoldier:  4a is a really good device . 4a 5G does not make substantial improvements to it . also its support time is not substantially longer
09:26:11 <take_a_deep_brea> and its more expensive because of 5G
09:26:27 <take_a_deep_brea> so overall a good investment
09:26:28 <strcat> antifasupersoldi: the 4a may be supported nearly as long anyway
09:26:37 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
09:27:28 <strcat> the 4a (5G) mostly adds 5G and a newer kernel LTS branch (4.19 instead of 4.14)
09:27:35 <strcat> same with Pixel 5
09:27:38 <antifasupersoldi> Other than the 5G, it has a slightly better Snapdragon CPU and better cameras too I heard. Not sure if the upgrade is worth the price hike. 5G isn't necessarily important to me yet as I doubt I'll be seeing it in my area soon.
09:27:42 <strcat> Pixel 5 is a somewhat fancier Pixel 4a (5G)
09:27:49 <strcat> same SoC
09:28:05 <strcat> no clue if 5G even works with GrapheneOS yet
09:28:08 <strcat> I guess it probably does
09:28:18 <strcat> I certainly can't test it
09:30:18 <strcat[m]> our recommendation will shift to 3 devices: Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a (5G), Pixel 5
09:30:52 <strcat[m]> it mostly means we won't be recommending 4 and 4 XL anymore, not because anything is wrong with them, just because they're a year older so they won't be supported as long
09:36:32 <strcat[m]> web install on Pixel 4a (5G) successful
09:36:45 <somenerd[m]> cool
09:37:03 <antifasupersoldi> I really liked GrapheneOS on the 4a, felt really snappy.
09:37:15 <antifasupersoldi> Is this web install thing new? I'm interested.
09:37:37 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
09:38:22 <take_a_deep_brea> use it on good ol' chrome
09:38:34 <take_a_deep_brea> or chromium or edgw
09:42:43 <strcat[m]> antifasupersoldier: yes we funded the development of this
09:42:54 <strcat[m]> antifasupersoldier: https://github.com/kdrag0n/fastboot.js
09:42:58 <strcat[m]> WebUSB-based fastboot
09:43:41 <strcat[m]> we're also likely to fund the same person making other things
09:43:58 <antifasupersoldi> Seems even easier than normal installing. Is doing it this way totally stable? I'll probably try it myself when I move back to Graphene.
09:44:23 <strcat[m]> yes it's stable and it's the recommended approach for most users now
09:44:36 <strcat[m]> it actually has somewhat nicer handling of certain edge cases than the CLI fastboot
09:45:38 <strcat[m]> CLI install has the advantage of being able to verify the signify signature which is made offline with a key unavailable to our servers
09:45:54 <strcat[m]> but that requires being on an OS providing working fastboot and signify
09:45:59 <strcat[m]> otherwise there's not much point
09:46:52 <antifasupersoldi> I am somewhat hesitant to do the process and move back to GrapheneOS. You told me my VPN should work as long as I use it separately on my phone and on my desktop, but I remember when I had GrapheneOS installed, for some reason when I connected it to my hotspot, I would get no internet. It would say something like "connected, no internet."
09:47:54 <strcat[m]> shouldn't be any issues with it
09:48:12 <somenerd[m]> think that that's a network problem
09:49:27 <antifasupersoldi> Weird thing is though I don't get the problem on Lineage/Calyx which bummed me out. Wanted to stick with Graphene.
09:49:56 <somenerd[m]> don't think that it's a GrapheneOS problem though
09:50:16 <antifasupersoldi> I'm sure it's not. But it still has me confused.
09:50:19 <strcat> antifasupersoldi: set your TTL 1 higher on your OS and use the VPN there
09:50:34 <strcat> net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=65 on Linux
09:50:35 <antifasupersoldi> TTL?
09:50:47 <strcat> antifasupersoldi: it sounds like your carrier is blocking traffic that appears to be tethered
09:51:01 <strcat> antifasupersoldi: and it gets passed through via hardware offload
09:51:13 <strcat> rather than intercepted and routed via the OS like they are doing
09:51:31 <strcat> so since the TTL is 1 lower than it would be if it wasn't routed through an extra hop
09:51:36 <strcat> the carrier can see it is tethered traffic
09:51:42 <strcat> they can't really see that
09:51:45 <strcat> but they can guess
09:52:16 <strcat> it would also be like that for a VM, container, etc. going through a router setup rather than having a link to itself
09:53:33 <antifasupersoldi> I used to use this same service with no VPN on the phone. I would just connect my desktop to the hotspot and only login to the VPN on the desktop. I like to have it constantly on both my devices now though.
09:54:01 <strcat[m]> well it should work fine if it works without the VPN on the phone
09:54:25 <antifasupersoldi> I was using a different phone at the time, same service though.
09:55:18 <antifasupersoldi> I'll just try it again soon. I was probably just tired and messing up something obvious. I tend to do that a lot.
09:56:01 <mynacol[m]> antifasupersoldier: We all do mess up sometimes

11:00:09 <take_a_deep_brea> Citizen528:  graphene OS cannot control what apps do about their databases
11:00:54 <take_a_deep_brea> the simple solution to the above issue would be signal implement database encryption and flush the key from memory when device is locked
11:01:31 <take_a_deep_brea> if you want a safer way to use signal on graphene keep it in a separate secondary user with a strong password lock a
11:01:47 <take_a_deep_brea> and end the secondary user session when not using signal
11:02:35 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: the OS and hardware have support for apps using hardware keystore keys to keep data at rest when locked
11:02:42 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: GrapheneOS has full support for that
11:02:57 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: Signal chooses not to keep their database at rest when locked
11:03:18 <strcat[m]> and I don't mean they lack the resources to implement it
11:03:21 <strcat[m]> I mean they choose to do it that way
11:03:31 <strcat[m]> they have rejected the concept of putting it at rest
11:04:31 <take_a_deep_brea> Citizen528:  suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#security-and-privacy
11:04:41 <strcat[m]> they already encrypt it using the hardware keystore but they don't set the boolean to make the key unavailable when locked and don't flush the sensitive data / wrapped key from memory
11:04:59 <strcat[m]> because they consider it too hard
11:05:30 <strcat[m]> (the flushing data part, which could be a process restart)
11:06:11 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption about the OS encryption
11:06:42 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: you can use a secondary profile and 'end session' to purge the disk encryption keys and set it back to before first unlock state
11:06:53 <strcat[m]> for the owner profile, the way to do that is a reboot
11:06:56 <Citizen528[m]> Thanks everyone. That's great to hear that grapheneos trys to mitigate this. So on the note of signals shit security practices, does matrix (or maybe it depends on the app in which case, element) handles that same aspect in a better way? Stopping the database when locked?
11:07:05 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: no, it's worse
11:07:12 <strcat[m]> assuming you mean element
11:07:51 <strcat[m]> it's entirely possible for an app to encrypt db with keystore key (as Signal already does) and set the key to require that the device is unlocked
11:08:03 <strcat[m]> and then purge the sensitive data, ideally via a process restart
11:08:10 <strcat[m]> when the device is locked
11:08:50 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: since each user profile has a separate disk encryption key you can 'end session' for secondary profiles to put them at rest
11:09:01 <strcat[m]> so if you use a secondary profile as your primary profile you have that button availablwe
11:09:07 <strcat[m]>  * so if you use a secondary profile as your primary profile you have that button available
11:09:09 <Citizen528[m]> Is their a macro I can use via one of those macro apps, to perform these actions automatically upon locking the phone?
11:09:47 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: a device manager could do it but... I wouldn't use one for it and I doubt there is one for doing that
11:09:53 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: also be aware if you end the session
11:09:57 <strcat[m]> you're not getting notifications, etc.
11:10:45 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: Signal could keep their database at rest while locked while still having notifications of new messages being available (it just couldn't decrypt them until you unlock)
11:11:08 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: they choose not to care about this, and choose not to implement keeping data at rest when locked
11:11:11 <strcat[m]> the OS supports it
11:11:34 <strcat[m]> it's a boolean option on an API they already use (alongside purging sensitive data when locking)
11:13:06 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: I don't actually understand why they bothered to encrypt the database with another layer of encryption using the hardware keystore but then stop short of doing this
11:14:05 <Citizen528[m]> Ignorance or so they can be compliant with law enforcement. Either one is shitty.
11:14:13 <strcat[m]> not ignorance
11:14:25 <strcat[m]> it's more like out of spite towards people who want stuff like this
11:14:36 <strcat[m]> that is their attitude about assorted things
11:14:39 <strcat[m]> like sandboxing
11:14:51 <strcat[m]> they could do WebRTC, etc. in an isolatedProcess sandbox (OS feature)
11:15:01 <strcat[m]> they choose not to be concerned with remote exploitation of the app
11:15:15 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: they just see stuff like this as silly to worry about basically
11:15:59 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: they care about having a solid encryption protocol, leaking minimal metadata and making the app appeal broadly to people with all kinds of frills / feature parity with mainstream messengers
11:16:11 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: protecting against targeted attacks (exploitation of the OS or the app) is not their thing
11:16:32 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: I cannot name an alternative messaging platform that cares
11:16:51 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: about either keeping the db at rest when locked or protecting against remote exploitation
11:17:11 <take_a_deep_brea> i think molly dev would be interested in implementing those things
11:17:22 <strcat[m]> molly can keep database at rest
11:17:29 <strcat[m]> it's not quite what I was talking about tho, it uses a passphrase to do it
11:17:44 <strcat[m]> it's entirely possible to do it based on the OS locking via keystore
11:17:48 <strcat[m]> with no additional friction for the user
11:17:49 <take_a_deep_brea> no apart from that what you just said about webrtc
11:17:53 <strcat[m]> ah
11:17:57 <strcat[m]> well it's pretty hard to do that downstream
11:18:00 <strcat[m]> it's invasive
11:18:06 <strcat[m]> it's natural to do it tho
11:18:12 <strcat[m]> I mean, Chromium itself runs WebRTC in the sandbox
11:18:29 <strcat[m]> the Chromium Layer-1 sandbox on Android is available to every app since it's an Android OS feature
11:18:30 <strcat[m]> isolatedProcess
11:18:34 <strcat[m]> any app can use it
11:18:41 <strcat[m]> app devs just don't give a shit
11:20:09 <Citizen528[m]> I guess the alternative is if I encounter law enforcement. I need to reboot/shutdown my phone and leave it at the lockscreen
11:20:43 <strcat[m]> Citizen528: or use secondary profiles for everything and use end session, but reboot is still nice because it ends all of them + owner profile
11:20:57 <strcat[m]> if you have time to reboot you should regardless
11:20:57 <Citizen528[m]> <strcat[m] "Citizen528: I cannot name an alt"> Session?
11:21:16 <strcat[m]> I doubt they have done work on either thing
11:21:42 <strcat[m]> I'd happily tell them they should
11:22:35 <strcat[m]> Moxie blocked me for a Twitter message questioning his incorrect claim that they require legacy non-scoped storage access to do local encrypted backups
11:22:41 <strcat[m]> and he claimed they can't do that on iOS when they could

11:22:59 <zvl12[m]> unless you use dissapearing messages and then they cant get anything...unless they can recover deleted messages ?
11:23:04 <strcat[m]> that is my experience and other people's experience
11:23:08 <strcat[m]> dealing with Signal upstream
11:23:29 <strcat[m]> it is not that they are malicious just... not open to outside input, even expert input that's nuanced and well informed
11:23:33 <Citizen528[m]> <zvl12[m] "> <@whatitdo:matrix.org> Does gr"> Good question. I do use disappearing messages
11:23:38 <strcat[m]> they do things their way and aren't open to alternatives
11:23:44 <strcat[m]> just how it is
11:24:02 <strcat[m]> they aren't acting in bad faith or something they are just like that
11:24:38 <take_a_deep_brea> like linux , huh
11:25:22 <strcat[m]> zvl12: well, disappearing messages do largely work in Signal but it's not *guaranteed* that data deleted that way is unrecoverable
11:25:45 <strcat[m]> and btw I personally got upstream Android to use SECURE_DELETE and truncation of rollback journals
11:25:54 <strcat[m]> so data does actually get deleted for real when you delete it from a db
11:26:02 <strcat[m]> but... that doesn't mean it's guaranteed to be unrecoverable
11:26:15 <strcat[m]> due to how storage hardware works
11:26:26 <strcat[m]> it may not actually choose to overwrite that data when you overwrite it
11:26:57 <strcat[m]> it may have decided that it has done a lot of writes there already and wants to start doing the writes elsewhere
11:27:14 <strcat[m]> reliable deletion of data is provided via Weaver (for profiles, see https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption) and the StrongBox keystore
11:27:31 <strcat[m]> you can reliably delete a profile, you can reliably factory reset the device and an app can reliable delete a StrongBox keystore key
11:27:37 <zvl12[m]> <strcat[m] "it may have decided that it has "> which app do you use for secure delete/wipe ? which one can be considered good ?
11:27:41 <strcat[m]> so apps can encrypt data with a keystore key then reliably delete it
11:27:54 <strcat[m]> zvl12: there is no such thing as retroactively securing wiping data
11:28:04 <strcat[m]> zvl12: you have to have encrypted it with a key that can be reliably deleted
11:28:22 <strcat[m]> zvl12: the OS does that for profiles and data as a whole
11:28:28 <strcat[m]> and provides it to apps via the StrongBox keystore
11:28:59 <strcat[m]> zvl12: if you delete a profile, that reliably wipes everything in it on a Pixel due to the secure element (Weaver feature)
11:29:04 <strcat[m]> zvl12: factory reset, same thing
11:29:23 <strcat[m]> zvl12: and apps have this available to them by using StrongBox keystore keys to encrypt data, then they can delete the key reliably
11:29:57 <strcat[m]> zvl12: if you stored data in a profile and want to reliably delete it, without just hoping the storage felt like actually overwriting it, then delete the profile
11:30:11 <strcat[m]> if it was in the owner profile, factory reset
11:32:00 <strcat[m]> unless you stored it in an app which explicitly implements reliable data deletion via the StrongBox keystore
11:32:21 <randomdude8192[m> So what does the lte-only mode do
11:32:38 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
11:32:50 <strcat[m]> disables 2G/3G
11:32:55 <strcat[m]> lower attack surface
11:34:36 <strcat[m]> need to update that info since VoLTE/VoWiFi works on most carriers which provide it now
11:35:24 <randomdude8192[m> Okey gotcha
11:38:15 <strcat[m]> updated it
11:38:16 <strcat[m]> > If you have a reliable LTE connection from your carrier, you can reduce attack surface by disabling 2G / 3G connectivity in Settings ‚ûî Network & Internet ‚ûî Mobile network ‚ûî Preferred network type. Traditional voice calls will only work in the LTE-only mode if you have either an LTE connection and VoLTE (Voice over LTE) support or a Wi-Fi connection and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi) support. VoLTE / VoWi-Fi works on
11:38:16 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS for most carriers unless they restrict it to carrier phones. US carriers other than T-Mobile tend to be missing these features due to us not including their proprietary apps.
11:39:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: 5g only mode possible?
11:39:18 <strcat[m]> sure but not useful
11:39:33 <strcat[m]> 5G coverage is really low
11:39:38 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode will disable 5G
11:40:21 <strcat[m]> I don't know if 5G coverage is actually intended to replace LTE everywhere...
11:40:36 <strcat[m]> but atm it's not worth considering that feature
11:40:45 <strcat[m]> even in a major city you can't use a 5G only mode
11:41:17 <strcat[m]> it's not that hard to add it if it becomes useful
11:41:26 <strcat[m]> and maintaining it will be similar to LTE only mode
11:41:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: does seem like it would get rid of more legacy code besides LTE only is disabling 5g now
11:41:41 <strcat[m]> porting it will involve dealing with the same changes etc
11:41:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe if our baseline is LTE only
11:41:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes but 5G coverage is not good enough that you can use 5G only
11:42:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> We could try LTE/NR only
11:42:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> So 4g or better only
11:42:39 <strcat[m]> for now I'd prefer to just have LTE only mode
11:42:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk
11:43:05 <strcat[m]> if someone cares that much about security then sacrificing 5G perf doesn't seem like a big deal
11:43:21 <strcat[m]> 5G == shit battery life anyway
11:43:49 <strcat[m]> it's not very mature yet
11:43:58 <strcat[m]> Pixels have the fanciest radio available for it
11:44:11 <strcat[m]> mmWave support
11:44:21 <strcat[m]> basically not available in the real world atm
11:45:12 <strcat[m]> hmm
11:45:23 <strcat[m]> it sounds like the full support for that might only be in the Verizon model
11:45:28 <strcat[m]> dunno, not going to worry about it
11:45:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does seem "4g or better" could be added though
11:46:09 <strcat[m]> yes it could
11:46:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> So it will stay at 4g as a minimum and if 5g is available it will use that
11:46:17 <strcat[m]> but it might not exist atm as an existing option
11:46:25 <strcat[m]> and we need the radio to support that mode to use it
11:46:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: NR/LTE
11:46:38 <strcat[m]> I don't know if the radio supports that mode
11:46:46 <strcat[m]> you have to check the list of what's supported
11:47:02 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode is something the radio already supported and we just made it available
11:47:04 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210212-171647.png (143KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/FHggiOyFcLSHvEYPFttoHUkD/Screenshot_20210212-171647.png >
11:47:14 <strcat[m]> guess it is then
11:47:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have NR only which sets 5g only and NR/LTE which is 5g+4g but nothing else
11:48:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wonder what happens if I set NR only on pixel 4 though
11:49:08 <manjusri[m]> some of us might prefer LTE mode only instead of LT or better. I myself am a telecom engineer and would stay away from 5G for a while, for anyone else it's your choice what you want to use
11:49:11 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just note that setting is temporary
11:49:18 <manjusri[m]>  * some of us might prefer LTE mode only instead of LTE or better. I myself am a telecom engineer and would stay away from 5G for a while, for anyone else it's your choice what you want to use
11:49:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah nvm it just resets
11:49:35 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that setting is temporary and if network access drops it resets
11:49:42 <strcat[m]> it's different than the persistent setting we extended
11:49:53 <strcat[m]> it's a debugging feature vs. the persistent setting we changed
11:50:31 <strcat[m]>  * anupritaisno1: that hidden setting is temporary and if network access drops it resets
11:50:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> manjusri: it won't really matter where you are from there is a minor issue rn
11:50:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> If we have a 4g only mode and it disables 5g
11:50:57 <randomdude8192[m> Any info on Microg timeline?
11:51:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are people who will need 5g
11:51:06 <randomdude8192[m> * Any info on Microg timeline? Like when is it coming
11:51:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then they'll end up not using the LTE only mode at all
11:51:20 <strcat[m]> randomdude8192: see https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
11:51:31 <strcat[m]> randomdude8192: we are making our own approach to this not using microG
11:51:58 <grabba[m]> Graphene doesn't support LTE calling or texts from my carrier ; it worked on normal android os . Is there a way to configure it?
11:52:07 <strcat[m]> grabba: which carrier
11:52:20 <manjusri[m]> anupritaisno1: true, I don't mean not having a 5G only mode, I mean having one for LTE only and one for 5G only so that we can select what we want, and not have to use one setting for both: LTE or better, like you suggested
11:52:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> grabba: at the moment we do not support it for any US based carriers. Please file issues if it's broken for others
11:52:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> And I'll have a look
11:52:46 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: we do support it for some US carriers
11:52:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> * grabba: at the moment we do not support it for most US based carriers. Please file issues if it's broken for others
11:52:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it works on T-Mobile (VoLTE and Vo-WiFi)
11:53:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: a more accurate response is we don't include extended carrier configuration for US carriers so some features may be unavailable on some carriers
11:53:23 <strcat[m]> it does not imply it doesn't work
11:53:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: that'd mean tmo doesn't have weird hacks to enable these features
11:53:37 <strcat[m]> yes, which, you would hope would be the norm
11:53:38 <strcat[m]> but sadly isn't
11:53:47 <strcat[m]> T-Mobile is actually not completely broken
11:53:50 <strcat[m]> unlike other US carriers
11:54:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> manjusri: staying at 5g all the time is also not a great idea
11:54:20 <strcat[m]> but people would probably be unhappy if they realized that T-Mobile uses Google servers for various things
11:54:24 <strcat[m]> so I'm just not going to recommend carriers
11:54:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> A 4g only and a 4g or better option is more battery friendly
11:54:55 <manjusri[m]> agreed, as long as I can have an option to avoid 5G :)
11:55:14 <strcat[m]> manjusri: you have that option even with just the standard Android configuration
11:55:26 <strcat[m]> the standard Android configuration is basically to work around broken implementations of newer standards
11:55:38 <strcat[m]> so it's always to set using a certain generation and below
11:55:43 <strcat[m]> and what we add is the ability to use only LTE
11:55:51 <strcat[m]> the "LTE and below" option is standard
11:56:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: btw does vo5g exist?
11:56:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or is that still a distant feature
11:56:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: VoLTE is just "voice over data" really
11:56:26 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it exists it's just VoLTE
11:56:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: then why did it take until LTE to do voice over data
11:56:55 <strcat[m]> because it uses IMS
11:57:06 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: there is SMS over LTE too we just don't talk about it
11:57:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the older stuff didn't?
11:57:11 <strcat[m]> cause no one cares if their SMS goes over LTE normally
11:57:27 <strcat[m]> but you can hear if you have VoLTE
11:57:27 <strcat[m]> because it doesn't sound like talking to someone through an aquarium
11:57:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> but you can hear if you have VoLTE
11:57:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> > because it doesn't sound like talking to someone through an aquarium
11:57:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh lol
11:58:06 <strcat[m]> if you have VoLTE you have voice over 5G
11:58:08 <strcat[m]> it's the same
11:58:26 <strcat[m]> VoLTE means voice over IMS (data)
11:58:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: also does video calling ever work
11:58:27 <randomdude8192[m> "We're developing" so is there a timeline on when is it coming
11:58:47 <strcat[m]> randomdude8192: no and it's not microG, it will be our own thing, where it won't have massive security issues
11:58:58 <strcat[m]> randomdude8192: we had 2 plans and all effort is being redirected into 1 of the 2 plans
11:59:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> randomdude8192: our focus is to develop high quality apps that don't require play services to function
11:59:01 <strcat[m]> because the other failed
11:59:08 <strcat[m]> that section is updated for the latest approach
11:59:11 <randomdude8192[m> Oh right thanks
11:59:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's not to encourage such dependencies at all
11:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Realize that by adding microg we are encouraging these dependencies
12:00:11 <strcat[m]> we aren't doing that anupritaisno1
12:00:21 <strcat[m]> everyone needs to just read https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
12:00:24 <strcat[m]> has our plans for this
12:01:09 <strcat[m]> there is no timeline
12:01:18 <strcat[m]> there is someone who has been doing some preliminary work on it
12:02:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: that's exactly what I said lol
12:02:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Realize that by adding something like microg or a stub implementation we are encouraging these dependencies
12:02:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Reworded it a bit
12:02:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Realize that by adding something like microg or a stub implementation we are encouraging these dependencies and encouraging users to use apps that have these dependencies
12:04:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Realize that by adding microg we"> Any stub implementation or microg could break at any time
12:04:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Users should find apps that get the same thing done without needing play services
12:05:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Instead of asking us to include a stub implementation
12:05:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then repeatedly bothering us to fix it whenever it breaks
12:05:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the stub implementation (our plan) isn't going to break because it doesn't work in the first place
12:06:03 <strcat[m]> the point of it is that it doesn't work
12:06:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: lol
12:06:10 <zvl12[m]> Anyone perhaps know what happened : my contact list in Graphene is "read only" ... cannot delete a contact ! not sure what i did here !!
12:06:13 <strcat[m]> I'm serious
12:06:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: yeah it's just funny
12:06:28 <strcat[m]> the point of it is that it doesn't work but the app sees it is there and can call it
12:06:30 <strcat[m]> and try to use it
12:06:46 <strcat[m]> so if they try to use FCM, it's not going to work, it's going to say the connection failed
12:06:56 <strcat[m]> but the app will work
12:06:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: just want to make users aware that it is in their best interests not to wait for a stub implementation anyway
12:07:01 <strcat[m]> it just won't have FCM push
12:07:15 <strcat[m]> if the app actually depends on the services working
12:07:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And instead use apps that don't have such dependencies
12:07:16 <strcat[m]> then it still won't work
12:07:18 <strcat[m]> if it doesn't then it can ork
12:07:24 <strcat[m]>  * if it doesn't then it can work
12:07:26 <strcat[m]> but yes ofc
12:07:38 <strcat[m]> it's better to use apps that actually test and intend to be available without Play services
12:07:54 <strcat[m]> because an app that uses Play services may end up using more and more of it and developing hard dependencies on it
12:07:54 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "Citizen528: I cannot name an alt"> I wonder if the guys from the Briar-app would be open to your suggestions. They seem to be focussed on users that really need the security and privacy of their messages (as opposed to most of us, who just feel better having them).
12:43:43 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Hi
12:43:43 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I once found an app showing the privacy issues with Android, where it showed every possible thing an app could do without any permissions.

14:20:29 <zaff> Hi guys, just a quick question. PIXELS 2 are no longer supported so I was considering switching to PIXEL 4, do I have to start from scratch or is there a way to clone somehow the current system onto a new device
14:22:23 <mynacol[m]> <zaff "Hi guys, just a quick question. "> You should be able to use the integrated backup solution under settings->system->backup for the transfer. A direct "clone" feature is not available

16:32:13 <g7x[m]> hi.  i have a pixel 3a and 4 using graphene latest, both are working just fine.  i had some questions regarding cellular providers if someone doesn't mind
16:34:18 <g7x[m]> i've been using both for secure communications and to simplify my mobile experience but i'm always hanging off of wifi vs baseband.
16:35:15 <g7x[m]> i'm having to travel in the states and was wondering what decent mobile provider is and if grapheneos has any restrictions on running data-only sims vs traditional gsm sim for voice/sms/data.  both my phones are unlocked and function on gsm/lte spectrums in the states
16:47:41 <entry1[m]> <g7x[m] "i'm having to travel in the stat"> So since GrapheneOS only works on fully unlocked/GSM devices, it works well globally. If you are visiting the states, I'd recommend anything with T-Mobile. If you can, get a Lyca Mobile sim for $35 off eBay for 4 months of service. 7gb of 4g LTE a month and unlimited talk and text.
16:48:37 <zvl12[m]> Why t mobile?
16:48:40 <g7x[m]> thanks, entry1.  i'm already in the states and will be here for a while.  i think mint mobile is a t-mobile mvno so it should work.  also cricket has data-only sims for 30$/mo if i'm not mistaken
16:49:01 <entry1[m]> That is the very cost effective plan. If you need unlimited data, you can get T-Mobile prepaid unlimited data plans for $20/no unlimited everything
16:49:03 <g7x[m]> cricket rides att which is not a terrible network
16:49:24 <g7x[m]> t-mobile unlimited data at 20$/mo? wow. must be some catch like buy 4 lines ;-)
16:49:45 <entry1[m]> <zvl12[m] "Why t mobile?"> Most cost effective, widely used, & great coverage Gsm provider
16:50:07 <entry1[m]> <g7x[m] "t-mobile unlimited data at 20$/m"> Nope, just have to swap out the sim. EBay has them, you can look them up
16:50:08 <heilalam> I try to install grapheneos on my pixel 3a, on which is installed android 11 until now. I updated android, enabled the oem unlocking, connected the pixel to the notebook (windows 10, version 2004), opened the bootleader interface and here my problems begin: when I try to unlock the bootleader, windows says that no device has been found. When I open
16:50:08 <heilalam> the device manager of windows, I see "pixel 3a" but with a warning triangle in front. Although I have the the newest windows-10-version, windows says that no driver can be found. Maybe it is also important that in the fast boot mode of the pixel the device state is declared as locked.
16:56:30 <entry1[m]> <heilalam "I try to install grapheneos on m"> Do you download all OS updates and optional updates?
16:56:44 <entry1[m]> * Did you download all OS updates and optional updates?
16:56:46 <g7x[m]> <entry1[m] "Nope, just have to swap out the "> i just found 3 months of mint mobile 8gb/mo for 45$ pre-paid/cash
16:57:13 <g7x[m]> seems reasonable.  after 3 months if i still need it, buy another one
16:57:51 <entry1[m]> <g7x[m] "i just found 3 months of mint mo"> Mint Mobile works great, they use T-Mobile (gsm) towers. You lose your number just so you know when you buy another 3 month card, can't port over
16:58:10 <nscnt[m]> heilalam: While your phone is in the bootloader interface and connected to your notebook: In Windows Updates, search for updates now. There might be a little link "View optional updates" where you will find an optional update for the Android Bootloader Interface.
16:58:10 <g7x[m]> yes, i'm aware.  i don't actually use a phone number for anything.
16:58:33 <g7x[m]> it gets exhausting trying to find wifi sometimes and mobile-hotspots are not always convenient
16:59:08 <g7x[m]> i like the fact airplane mode will truly disable baseband if i want some "quiet/privacy" in certain areas yet ethernet mode will still work
17:04:19 <entry1[m]> <g7x[m] "i like the fact airplane mode wi"> Exactly. Google has been known to still track data location with Airplane mode enabled. GrapheneOS, properly setup with app permissions, will eliminate this.
17:05:03 <g7x[m]> yeppers, it's why i use it.  i'm not excessively paranoid or a snowden-type.  just a person who wishes to fly a bit under the radar and communicate with my small group of friends :-)
17:05:33 <g7x[m]> i've been using orbot since the beginning with a killswitch, but am going to add a private wireguard endpoint for a bit of a speedboost

17:06:39 <nscnt[m]> heilalam23: Perfect
17:13:45 <zvl12[m]> <entry1[m] "Exactly. Google has been known t"> could you please explain which additional steps you take to properly setup permissions ?
17:14:53 <TheJollyRoger> zvl12[m]: in GrapheneOS, you don't.
17:15:15 <TheJollyRoger> zvl12[m]: the defaults in GrapheneOS are sane, and may be used with confidence.
17:16:55 <zvl12[m]> Understood, thanks
17:17:36 <TheJollyRoger> zvl12[m]: In GrapheneOS, when you first set up, you'll be asked if you want to allow location. Just set that to off. The goals of GrapheneOS are very clear in that the user should not be tasked with knobs, buttons, tunables, theatrics, etc, so it's pretty simple.
17:18:10 <g7x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "zvl12: In GrapheneOS, when you f"> i saw a thread between daniel and a guy on twitter debating the knobs.  seemed the person didn't understand
17:18:57 <TheJollyRoger> You can optionally choose to zero out sensor input since the sensors permission toggle is by default on to allow apps to use sensors - apps have no way of requesting them because that toggle is unique to GrapheneOS, apps have no way to opt out of it since it's not in their manifest, and denying it will cause some apps to break.
17:19:24 <TheJollyRoger> However, it and the Network permission are about the only tunables and buttons and knobs you're going to see.
17:19:31 <TheJollyRoger> g7x[m]: Sheesh.
17:20:33 <g7x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You can optionally choose to zer"> once a phone is setup, what is the option to zero out sensor input?  i had to go into each permissions and disable it except for signal and a couple of apps that i require
17:20:46 <TheJollyRoger> Well, and the Preferred Network option. But that's about it. That's all you'll need. Sane defaults, and not burdening the user with those choices are a core tenement of security.
17:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> g7x[m]: open up the app info menu, you'll see the Sensors permission toggle. That's it.
17:21:45 <g7x[m]> thanks, that was a bit too obvious, sorry mate
17:21:54 <TheJollyRoger> Rather than return a "ERROR:SecurityException" for sensors and risk crashing the app, Graphene chooses to simply return a string of zeroes instead.
17:21:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe no problem, no apology needed!
17:22:15 <BobSacmanto[m]> Can you encrypt your local storage on grapheneos?
17:22:19 <TheJollyRoger> This does break some apps though, which is why we leave it on.
17:22:38 <TheJollyRoger> BobSacmanto[m]: GrapheneOS is always encrypted.
17:22:43 <TheJollyRoger> Let me point you to the FAQ:
17:23:43 <TheJollyRoger> BobSacmanto[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption Here, check this out. There is no "Turn Encryption On" button because the phone is always encrypted and we don't want people accidentally turning it off.
17:24:16 <g7x[m]> what do you know?  cricket sim i had and activated for data-only 40$/mo usd with potential deprioritization after 50gb or heavy congestion works.
17:27:02 <BobSacmanto[m]> TheJollyRoger: thank you
17:28:11 <g7x[m]> <TheJollyRoger "g7x: open up the app info menu, "> i got into the app info -> sensors menu but i don't see a way to turn off all sensors.  is it a one by one toggle?  if if so is there anything i shouldn't turn off sensors on?
17:32:18 <BobSacmanto[m]> Will graphene ever support other open devices like fxtec pro1x which has an unlocked bootloader and can easily install other os like lineageos or unintuitive touch? My only con with the pixel is no sd card storage :(
17:37:34 <giffgaff[m]> L
17:39:38 <nullnode[m]> <BobSacmanto[m] "Will graphene ever support other"> Read the FAQ, and drop some donations.
17:40:36 <g7x[m]> disregard the cricket, ended up not working.  only saw the sim turn to cricket, but data is not working.
17:44:16 <g7x[m]> going to go pick up the mint mobile seems like a better option
17:44:57 <nullnode[m]> Did you make sure the APNs are in the vendor-platform files?
17:45:47 <nullnode[m]> 310 16 right?
17:45:53 <g7x[m]> good call, no i did not.  is there a link somewhere i can do this?
17:46:41 <g7x[m]> i've never used a sim with graphene over the last 18 months so i guess i'm learning again :-)
17:47:03 <nullnode[m]> I think the MCC MNC list for APNs is stored in android-prepare-vendor repository, need to confirm though haven't done a build myself in sometime
17:47:07 <g7x[m]> would be nice to use what i just bought :-)

17:52:30 <ryan[m]4> nscnt: Also the Dark Theme has the same issue
17:53:52 <nscnt[m]> Not sure what you mean. Apps are responsible to implement the Dark Theme. They probably use the automatic DayNight switch, but if your whole system doesn't switch themes, your app won't as well.

17:54:39 <nscnt[m]> Ah, nvm
17:54:43 <ryan[m]4> Sun rose hours ago
17:54:52 <nscnt[m]> Yea, sure. That's affected as well
17:55:51 <heilalam23> Now I executed the flash-release ‚Äì unfortunately for several times. This was because the first flashing ended in a modus with 4 options (1) reboot system now, 2) enter recovery, 3) reboot to bootloader, 4) power off). Accidentally, I pressed the pause button, because the laptop-display went into the energy saving modus, I triggered a second
17:55:52 <heilalam23> flash. Lastly the device stopped in the fastboot mode. Should I restart the bootloader now? And do I make it by pressing the power key for a longer while?
17:57:20 <TheJollyRoger> g7x[m]: The sensors permission is app-by-app.
17:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> BobSacmanto[m]: devices like those don't meet the security standards of the project. Please see https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices Future Devices, to get an idea of what the devices will need to have in order to be considered for GrapheneOS.
18:00:17 <g7x[m]> thanks jolly.
18:00:29 <TheJollyRoger> g7x[m]: Arr, ye be welcome!
18:00:33 <g7x[m]> i have the apn setup properly with cricket, but no data is working.  going to try the mint mobile and see if that works.
18:02:18 <heilalam23> My question has resolved itself:-)
18:10:07 <ryan[m]4> Which repo would the "on until sunrise" be in so i can check if theres an issue open?
18:10:08 <ryan[m]4>  * Which repo would the "on until sunrise" feature for dark theme and night light be in so i can check if theres an issue open?
18:16:31 <g7x[m]> this is likely a poor question.  typically at home i have a single wifi connection that goes somewhere.  and there's no wifi spots next to me for at least a km.
18:16:54 <g7x[m]> in the states they are all over.  is there a way to keep all of the wifi ssids/bsids from being correlated when graphene looks for your pre-defined ap?
18:23:47 <g7x[m]> going to go pickup a pre-paid mint kit.  godspeed to me!
18:24:59 <antifasupersoldi> Can you get prepaid service anymore these days where you don't need tie an identity to it, like your name or whatever?
18:25:11 <antifasupersoldi> Thought that was a thing of the past.
18:29:19 <g7x[m]> <antifasupersoldi "Can you get prepaid service anym"> yes you can in the states.  most mvnos let you grab a sim and fill card with cash.  mint will let you get the starter kit that way.
18:29:54 <g7x[m]> and you can refill with prepaid debit cards, i'm only in the states for about 9 months so i dont have credit cards available
18:30:20 <antifasupersoldi> May I ask where you're from when you're not in the States?
18:30:54 <g7x[m]> <antifasupersoldi "May I ask where you're from when"> sure, not in the states.

21:09:45 <Publius> zvL12: I think there is confusion regarding 4a vs 4a5G
21:10:45 <Publius> I think BobSacmanto was trying to establish timeline between 4a beta and stable - so he could guess how long it might be before 4a5G stable gets released
21:13:59 <Publius> When I was perusing the waybackmachine web archive for the grapheneOS releases page - seemed to me like it was early November for the 4a experimental release, with the first stable release following about a week later.
21:16:04 <hypokeimenon[m]> Obviously the more people helping out with testing the better.
21:16:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> If no one is testing Beta/Stable becomes a less meaningful distinction.
21:19:51 <Publius> I only got my 4a for GOS a couple weeks ago, but I kinda want to snag a 4a5G if for no other reason than to help test
21:40:07 <g7x[m]> strange thing with the mint sim.  it starts working on tmo apn, then stops.  go to add a custom apn for mvno using their settings, save the apn profile, but the custom apn profile never shows up and is not searchable
21:40:58 <Ed6> Hi. I've just installed GrapheneOS on Pixel 4a. I've installed several apps using Aurora. How do I update these apps? Do I just reinstall them, or what? Thanks.
21:46:38 <b1101> Ed6: there's an update section in aurora
21:53:04 <zvl12[m]> Do you recommend the 4a5G over the 5 ? Besides price/finish of the device itself, does GOS is better suited for one or the other ?
21:57:17 <Ed6> Thanks b1101!
22:00:01 <Publius> zvl12: I speculate that GOS would be equally good on either device. The 4a5G will be supported longer, so there's an advantage there. However, fact there's a slick, stable release for the 4a right now, and the device is less expensive, and 5G coverage is crap right now puts the 4a at an advantage. No wrong call, pros/cons to both
22:00:48 <Publius> Whoops, I answered the question of 4a vs 4a5G, not 4a5G vs. 5. Please disregard.
22:01:15 <zvl12[m]> <Publius "Whoops, I answered the question "> this was going to be my next question you answered in advance !!
22:03:15 <BobSacmanto[m]> Is there a way to disable the 5G in a 5G phone? I dont want 5G nuking my brain

22:11:21 <b1101> seeing the new support for the 5, makes me want to upgrade more. gonna wait it out for prices to drop
22:13:38 <franken-sword-us> hi, yall -- brand new to GOS.  ditching my apple phone, and looking for decent hardware that is well supported.  it appears most folks choosing pixel 4 or 4a?  what does the group recommend?
22:15:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hello franken-sword-us, right now, the 4a is the "best value for the money" phone.
22:16:40 <TheJollyRoger> The 4 has a slightly nicer screen, and is made of glass and metal (the 4a is polycarbonate), and has the facial recognition unlock feature, but the 4a has the very well-loved fingerprint sensor, and the 1/8" audio jack, will be supported for longer, and costs a *lot* less. The devices have comparable security.
22:18:03 <TheJollyRoger> clarification: When I say "glass and metal" I mean the 4 has a glass **back**. Both phones have gorilla glass screens. The 4a's back and body is polycarbonate.
22:18:17 <franken-sword-us> yea, reading....   https://www.tomsguide.com/news/pixel-4a-vs-pixel-4
22:18:25 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
22:19:13 <randomdude8192[m> What about pixel 5? Its not supported but what about the hardware and things
22:19:34 <b1101> 5 just got experimental support,
22:19:50 <BobSacmanto[m]> Publius: not if you live in the country
22:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 5 is only supported *experimentally* at this moment. As of yesterday, images for the 5 and 4a5G went live, but they are experimental.
22:20:56 <TheJollyRoger> So I encourage you to run them, and to work with us at finding and discovering bugs, breakages, broken stuff, etc.
22:20:59 <randomdude8192[m> Yeah but how does it diferent from pixel4 hardware wise
22:21:22 <randomdude8192[m> Like whats the diference between them
22:21:50 <b1101> randombloke[m]: look that up on gsmarena.com good phone comparison there
22:21:58 <randomdude8192[m> Oh thanks
22:22:16 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall correctly, the 5 and 4a5G will both have a newer SoC. I haven't read that much about them, although I got to see a 5 and noticed that the 5 has a metal unibody, no glass.
22:22:16 <TheJollyRoger> *no glass back.
22:22:19 <b1101> find one one, then once you're looking at it hit compare and add the other
22:22:36 <TheJollyRoger> The 5 is also advertised as having the ability to wirelessly charge other devices, but I haven't got one so I can't tell you any more on this.
22:23:04 <Publius> I think the glass back is a moot point if you are planning to put the device into an action jacket
22:23:05 <randomdude8192[m> <b1101 "find one one, then once you're l"> Right
22:23:30 <b1101> mistype :P
22:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> I think the body of the 5 is covered in a kind of plastic over-coating, the aluminium is apparently a skeletized frame, to allow for wireless charging with a metal body.
22:24:05 <zvl12[m]> 4a5G advantage over the 5 (at least for me) is screen size (bigger)
22:24:16 <TheJollyRoger> The plastic is not removable.
22:25:41 <Publius> I think we should all shill for the 4a5G and 5 so there are more GOS devices in the field being tested
22:25:56 <TheJollyRoger> Publius: yeah, I usually put my phone into a Spigen case, since those spigen cases tend to look alright, they're nice and grippy, and very protective. It's saved my phone from several mishaps before, so I don't let my phone go without one. I'm paranoid about smashing the glass, I'd feel heartbroken saying bye-bye to eight hundred dollars.
22:26:08 <TheJollyRoger> Publius: Hehehe, good thinking, I like your thoughts ^_^.
22:26:23 <franken-sword-us> i honestly just want a snappy phone that makes calls and does texts and has a couple apps.  GOS able to install anything from play store?  assuming that is the case b/c it is android based....
22:26:48 <franken-sword-us> assume i could install through adb
22:27:07 <Publius> I have the Spigen "tough armor" case on my 4a. Really like it. The kickstand seems flimsy, but whatever.
22:27:27 <randomdude8192[m> Pixel5 doesnt have 3.5mm jack.. Hate it xd
22:27:27 <TheJollyRoger> franken-sword-us: They will install, via side-loading (you will need to turn on sideloading manually, it's just one tap). However, note that apps that are dependent on Google Play Services being present on your phone and that can't function without them may refuse to run.
22:27:57 <franken-sword-us> i don't want to install any app that depends on google play services...ever :)
22:28:09 <Publius> franken-sword-us: My new 4a runs super snappy and smooth. Way, way way better than my old motorola XT1575 (moto-x pure) did on any of the ROMs I used.
22:28:56 <TheJollyRoger> Or they may function in strange ways: for instance, the Protonmail app, is dependent on Google Play Services for push notifications. So anecdotally according to a number of users here that use it, what ends up happening is that the app runs and functions fine, but it will not display "new messages!" notifications at all until you open the app.
22:29:06 <franken-sword-us> y'all sold me -- off hunting for a 4a
22:29:07 <TheJollyRoger> Because the app depends on Play Services telling it to wake up when new E-mails arrive.
22:29:20 <Publius> Overall super happy with the 4a in every way. It's size is perfect, it boots fast, it shuts down fast. It restarts fast. Just a great device so far.
22:29:39 <Publius> Be sure to buy an UNLOCKED device... NOT from any carrier!
22:29:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's the big catch, the easiest and safest way is to buy direct from Google Store.
22:30:05 <TheJollyRoger> Not a refurb, either.
22:30:08 <franken-sword-us> ah, thanks TheJollyRoger that's interesting...yea, i do use protonmail, but notifications not working is not much of a deal-breaker.  i hate email notifications unless you want to acquire ADHD
22:30:10 <Publius> Pretty sure you'll find $350 + tax, delivered is best price you'll find. I bought mine via (ugh) Amazon
22:30:37 <TheJollyRoger> Because the kids being paid eight bucks to recieve the used phones don't know what the difference is and will likely mix them up and chuck them all in the same bin.
22:30:51 <franken-sword-us> <Publius "Pretty sure you'll find $350 + t"> someone needs to build alternative marketplace... <sigh>
22:31:25 <Publius> I've been making a point to NOT use Amazon. Pretty sure Bezos is basically the inspiration for Samuel L Jackson's character in "Kingsman"
22:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> The Signal Android App is an example of an app that is built to function without Play Services, but what it does to display notifications is that it runs in the background. so you'll always see a little "Signal is connected" app. However, Signal is aggressively optimized to not need play services if they are absent.
22:31:57 <franken-sword-us> telegram work w/o google play services?
22:32:05 <Publius> But unfortunately, we're at the point where you have to pay EXTRA to buy from non-Amazon, which is also less convenient than Amazon... Ugh
22:32:09 <TheJollyRoger> The reason Signal uses Google Play is to allow it to "sleep" and not need to run and consume clock cycles. It only relies on Play services to tell the app "Hey, wake up, you have new messages!" and then retrieve them, then immediately return to sleeping.
22:32:59 <TheJollyRoger> Telegram, I don't know. You'll have to ask the others, I have never used it.
22:33:03 <TheJollyRoger> Gotta go for a bit. See you soon.

22:34:01 <Thatcher[m]> <Publius "But unfortunately, we're at the "> I'm happy to pay a little extra to support the smaller businesses
22:34:12 <Thatcher[m]> Fuck amazon
22:34:36 <Thatcher[m]> And Fuck Amazon Basics usb cables
22:34:42 <Publius> Agreed. It's a double bummer to pay extra AND get less convenience though. Still better to vote with your $$
22:35:09 <Publius> I bought a 3 pack of 5-foot USB A-C cables from ebay for $4. All three flash great
22:35:30 <Publius> And they are really flexible, so they don't put strain on your charging port
22:35:33 <franken-sword-us> how about the fact that when they say a private merchant start making $$ they clone the product and promote the AMZN brand and push the private merchant to the bottom of all search results and reviews.  good times.
22:37:17 <Publius> I don't blame entrepreneurs making lots of money based on ingenuity and hard work. But somewhere along the line that money turns into oligarchical power, hubris, politization and ill will. That's when I check out
22:37:48 <Publius> politicization

22:46:04 <Thatcher[m]> I have to admit, I operate only one profile entirely on the owner account. Maybe it's time to jump on the multi-user bandwagon
22:47:05 <zvl12[m]> if you name that second user "Add guest" as the "original Add guest" , then there is full confusion ... (and yes you can do it this way)
22:47:07 <koodab[m]> <zvl12[m] "I am now going to move all my ap"> Why
22:47:34 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It presents some issues with Signal unfortunately.  I found that signal will consider each user a new phone who needs verification and logging in.

22:48:37 <koodab[m]> DAMN

22:49:54 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <zvl12[m] "uninstall from main user and rei"> Yes the question then is how many users you want and which one gets signal
22:50:04 <koodab[m]> <zvl12[m] "by those ones who have the power"> So who

22:50:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <zvl12[m] "now thats a good reason to do it"> Not gonna lie I thought this first :)

22:52:59 <koodab[m]> My bad
22:52:59 <Publius> Also, I thought that case law was at a point where you CAN be compelled to unlock device via fingerprint or facial recognition, but you can NOT be compelled to supply a pin or password

22:54:31 <braxtono[m]> Is there a setting for erase on x pin attempts?
22:55:00 <zvl12[m]> <braxtono[m] "Is there a setting for erase on "> pertty sure no
22:55:57 <koodab[m]> So we should have a second user in case we are forced tp hand a pin over
22:55:59 <Thatcher[m]> <braxtono[m] "Is there a setting for erase on "> I had this setting activated on my old phone and my friends played an evil trick on me by maxing out my password attempts.
22:56:29 <zvl12[m]> <koodab[m] "So we should have a second user "> thats the way i see it
22:56:39 <braxtono[m]> <koodab[m] "So we should have a second user "> Have a blank user and give that pin

22:57:36 <Publius> zvl12: Understood
22:57:37 <koodab[m]> So the Owner has nothing on it and thr Second user has all my important stiff
22:58:10 <Publius> That second user named "Add user" would probably hold up against most scrutiny
22:58:33 <koodab[m]> But theres already a Add user option
22:58:44 <koodab[m]> And a Add guest option

23:01:05 <zvl12[m]> <koodab[m] "You are not on GrapheneOS? "> of course i am !
23:02:32 <Thatcher[m]> Having more than one 'Add user' creates confusion which strengthen plausible deniability
23:02:59 <zvl12[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Having more than one 'Add user' "> EXACTLY

23:07:55 <Publius> Everyone else just get a notification for Signal update?
23:08:31 <zvl12[m]> <Publius "Everyone else just get a notific"> via where you get them ?
23:09:03 <Publius> Notification on my lock screen
23:10:16 <lasseter[m]> In terms of timely notification, what is the best instant message app for GOS these days.  I love Element, but I'll often not see I was messaged until I open the app.  Signal seems to work better in that regard, but I hate that is requires a phone number and is not federated.
23:11:11 <Publius> Alright y'all, I'm off till wednesday. Keep graphening and I'll TTYS
23:11:25 <Thatcher[m]> <Publius "Alright y'all, I'm off till wedn"> Have fun!
23:15:46 <Thatcher[m]> <lasseter[m] "In terms of timely notification,"> Signal is the only 'secure' messaging app with their own websocket to provide real-time push notifications in absence of Google Play services, so I'd say Signal / Molly
23:16:45 <Thatcher[m]> I use Molly-Foss and it works just the way you'd expect a messaging app to function in Graphene

23:21:36 <zvl12[m]> Can I consider F-Droid and Aurora as "safe to source from", or maybe some alternatives ?
23:21:52 <braxtono[m]> Yes
23:30:16 <zvl12[m]> Trying to install F-Droid on second user... not allowing "App not installed"

23:32:45 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Short answer: you can't install a lower version on a different user than the highest installed on any user
23:33:47 <zvl12[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "Short answer: you can't install "> solution is then to delete the other one ... by "lower/highest" you mean ?
23:34:05 <zvl12[m]> No problem with TOR..

23:36:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> User 2 tries to install 1.0 = fail
23:37:11 <mr_hebi_san[m]> User 2 must make sure they are installing v 1.11 or higher
