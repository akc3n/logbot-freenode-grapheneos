00:26:57 <Sam[m]7> <zknshfr[m] "Do the apps have permission to u"> So the wording is slightly different on android 11, but as far as I can tell, they have background permissions enabled. I'm coming to this conclusion based off the fact that sensors like the microphone and camera are limited to "only while app is in use" since I don't see this wording for network permission, I assume background data usage is enabled. I dream of being able to
00:26:58 <Sam[m]7> configure these permissions in VScode...that's just a dream right? Unless I'm running Debian I can't really do that to AOSP correct?
00:28:41 <strcat[m]> zknshfr: doesn't make sense to implement that for network
00:28:53 <strcat[m]> zknshfr: you need to think through what the permission does
00:29:27 <strcat[m]> Sam: no clue why you're talking about visual studio code and debian
00:31:49 <strcat[m]> zknshfr: if you give an app network access, it can upload whatever it wanted to previous upload
00:32:04 <strcat[m]>  * zknshfr: if you give an app network access, it can upload whatever it wanted to previously upload
00:43:13 <Sam[m]7> I'm only at an Associate's level in coding at a local "accredited" school, so please forgive me for the lack of understanding. OK, so what I'm getting at is.... I can enable permissions for while app is in use, or not at all. I'm testing this, not relying on the security of this method just yet. Even if I give all permission I can possibly find in GrapheneOS GUI to the Element client, I cannot connect a call of any kind.
00:43:13 <Sam[m]7> This is specifically an issue for me on Graphene. I have 6 other test devices running several different operating systems. No issues encrypted or unencrypted. Just on the Graphene instance I have running on a physical Pixel 4a. In other words, is anyone in this Matrix community able to connect video/audio calls running Graphene OS? And if so, what steps did you take from a fresh installation?
00:45:07 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what that has to do with what you previously said or the other conversation
00:45:55 <Sam[m]7> <strcat[m] "Sam: no clue why you're talking "> Just thinking it would be amazing if I could edit app network permissions in the same way I can edit a basic firewall via a configuration script in GNU Linux. However I'm not familiar enough with how AOSP functions to know if that is a possibility.
00:46:15 <strcat[m]> you're jumping to different things
00:46:18 <strcat[m]> and what you're saying doesn't make sense
00:46:32 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading the FAQ and other information on the site as a starting point
00:48:06 <Sam[m]7> I've read the FAQ...
00:48:55 <Sam[m]7> "How do I make a video call in the Element client for matrix on Graphene OS?"
00:49:04 <strcat[m]> so I'm not sure why you're making it seem like you need to know how to program to set up firewall rules but please read the previous discussion
00:49:18 <strcat[m]> on why you're misguided by thinking there's something more to get out of that than a binary network toggle
00:49:23 <strcat[m]> which also CANNOT be implemented that way
00:49:45 <strcat[m]> already been elaborated on in depth today in the channel
00:50:13 <strcat[m]> simply being able to resolve a domain via DNS gives an app the power to exfiltrate data to anywhere
00:50:27 <strcat[m]> ability to connect to any domain is ability to export data to anywhere
00:50:48 <Essjay[m]> <Sam[m]7 ""How do I make a video call in t"> Try asking this in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
00:51:11 <strcat[m]> I would recommend asking questions about apps in the communities for those apps
00:51:18 <strcat[m]> or ask the developers
00:51:38 <strcat[m]> we don't make Element, we don't know what functionality it has that depends on Play services, etc.
00:51:49 <strcat[m]> and most people here probably don't use that app
00:52:06 <Sam[m]7> Okay...I see where I went wrong now. My apologies, wrong room.
00:52:06 <strcat[m]> particularly specific functionality of it
00:54:16 <strcat[m]> read the previous discussion here on network filtering
00:54:24 <strcat[m]> fine-grained filtering doesn't work and we don't do security theater
00:54:35 <strcat[m]> if something cannot actually be implemented in a meaningful way we don't pretend to offer it
00:54:38 <strcat[m]> that would be misleading and harmful
00:54:55 <strcat[m]> FAQ explains that you can use NetGuard
00:55:01 <strcat[m]> I'm explaining to you that the whole concept doesn't work
00:55:13 <strcat[m]> you're free to take a misguided fine-grained firewall approach that doesn't work if you choose
00:55:33 <strcat[m]> we won't offer it as built-in functionality because security theater and non-working features go against what we believe in
00:55:51 <strcat[m]> an on/off toggle has the potential to work
00:56:18 <strcat[m]> fine-grained filtering doesn't work and is based on a naive interpretation of how networking actually works
00:56:47 <strcat[m]> and lacks a threat model and the reasoning required for it to actually be a meaningful privacy / security feature
00:56:59 <strcat[m]> any feature in GrapheneOS has to be designed with an adversary in mind
00:57:14 <Sam[m]7> I don't want to say "I completely understand", but I get why that was a stupid question to ask this channel. Again, I apologize for the unintentional spam.
00:57:25 <strcat[m]> I'm not talking about Element
01:14:21 <whereami[m]> I have a pixel 2. Is there a guide to build graphene for unsupported device? I think pixel 2 was supported before
01:16:19 <strcat[m]> there's no official GrapheneOS support for it anymore
01:16:23 <strcat[m]> we removed it from the documentation
01:16:37 <strcat[m]> and it's not supported by the main branch
01:16:46 <strcat[m]> you can't really have real GrapheneOS on it
01:21:31 <whereami[m]> So even old devices won't build? Or just not supported?
01:21:42 <TheJollyRoger> whereami[m]: the Pixel 2 is unsupported now because both Qualcomm and Upstream have abandoned it. Even if you were to somehow backport the security bugfixes from upstream back to the device and compile it the way Lineage does, the device is no longer secure.
01:22:56 <strcat[m]> whereami: it was never supported by the latest branch of AOSP (android11-qpr1)
01:23:11 <strcat[m]> and it isn't officially supported by GrapheneOS
01:23:34 <strcat[m]> to help users transition away from the insecure Pixel 2 phones we continue doing extended support releases for them
01:23:44 <strcat[m]> we don't provide official documentation or support for them though
01:23:56 <strcat[m]> you should focus your effort on a supported device that can be secured
01:24:36 <whereami[m]> OK thx.
01:29:08 <whereami[m]> I wanted to try graphene so I bought the pixel 2  recently. Not for daily driver, just a WiFi phone for home. What would be the next best way to use the phone if graphene will not build?
01:29:53 <TheJollyRoger> whereami[m]: put it in airplane mode, disable wifi, disable bluetooth, and use it as a cheap powerpack, or an mp3 player.
01:30:11 <strcat[m]> whereami: recommend getting a refund
01:30:18 <TheJollyRoger> Or that, haha!
01:30:19 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 is an insecure legacy device
01:30:29 <TheJollyRoger> whereami[m]: To put it bluntly, the Pixel 2 is now frontdoored for any exploits targeting the SoC that were written after the 2nd of November of last year. They will not be fixed because Qualcomm will not fix them, and Qualcomm is the only one that can.
01:30:30 <strcat[m]> would have recommended getting a Pixel 4a
01:31:08 <strcat[m]> whereami: you can see we still have extended support releases for it
01:31:15 <strcat[m]> no official support
01:31:20 <strcat[m]> and it's insecure
01:31:25 <strcat[m]> those are to help people transition off of it
01:31:43 <strcat[m]> we try our best to discourage buying legacy devices
01:31:53 <strcat[m]> if we had more help with development we could add newer generation devices sooner
01:32:55 <strcat[m]> right now most resources are going to non-development-related things
01:33:03 <strcat[m]> defending the project from the ongoing attacks on it by Copperhead and others
01:33:51 <strcat[m]> anyway it's a waste of time to spend time on the Pixel 2, work on something else
01:34:18 <whereami[m]> I understand it's insecure, this was just to be a play phone. I bought it 2nd hand with cracked screen so I didn't lose money. Just wanted to experiment. But I understand, it is unsupported. I will just use lineage then
01:34:59 <strcat[m]> think you missed something about what I said
01:35:00 <strcat[m]> oh well
01:37:05 <whereami[m]> I didn't miss anything
01:37:40 <strcat[m]> I explained we have extended support releases and a separate branch for it
01:37:48 <strcat[m]> which we consider unofficial support
01:37:52 <strcat[m]> because the device is insecure
01:37:59 <strcat[m]> it's not real GrapheneOS
01:40:16 <strcat[m]> there is nothing you can use on it to change that
01:40:40 <strcat[m]> we just aren't going to put a dishonest patch level and pretend we're able to secure it when we can't
01:40:41 <whereami[m]> I understand, graphene is not for those who don't need full security.
01:40:41 <whereami[m]> What I don't understand is why my last message was moderated
01:41:17 <whereami[m]> But I will look into the other branch & figure it out
01:41:21 <whereami[m]> Thx
01:41:23 <strcat[m]> it isn't meant for usage without security updates, where you have known remote code execution bugs and other serious problems
01:41:52 <strcat[m]> you won't have even basic, bare minimum security
01:43:18 <whereami[m]> I was under impression it would be better than stock though, even if stock has no longer support, since it includes more secure apps
01:44:27 <strcat[m]> either way it's insecure
01:44:41 <strcat[m]> no matter what OS you put on it
01:44:42 <whereami[m]> Just wanted to experiment with android security.
01:45:04 <TheJollyRoger> whereami[m]: you could set it up as a "target" device to do penetration testing on.
01:45:36 <strcat[m]> really would have recommended a Pixel 4a for development / research
01:45:45 <strcat[m]> 5a when it comes out
01:46:25 <TheJollyRoger> But the device is a poptart.
01:49:29 <whereami[m]> I am no expert, just someone interested to learn security. I wanted to learn how graphene improves the security. Buying a new expensive phone is not practical
01:49:48 <TheJollyRoger> whereami[m]: in that case, I have an idea for you.
01:49:51 <strcat[m]> 2 is a flagship, 4a is a budget device
01:50:00 <TheJollyRoger> If you're willing to listen.
01:50:43 <strcat[m]> the extended support releases we do for the Pixel 2 aren't something we consider GrapheneOS
01:50:55 <strcat[m]> it will be delisted from the site soon
01:51:23 <strcat[m]> if our extended support releases are encouraging people to keep using it they're doing more harm than good
01:51:44 <strcat[m]> the only device I can recommend buying for GrapheneOS right now is a 4a
01:52:52 <louipcm> whereami:  lol people on IRC cant see those emoji
01:55:43 * whereami[m] TheJollyRoger I'm listening
01:57:15 <TheJollyRoger> whereami[m]: What you could do, if you're interested in doing penetration testing, is you could get several different operating system images at the present, and then set that old phone up as a "target" so you can test exploits on it.
01:57:40 <TheJollyRoger> Of course, keeping in mind that that phone is essentially frozen in time.
01:58:14 <TheJollyRoger> But it'd give you a great way to start experimenting with the basics.
01:58:59 <TheJollyRoger> But again, that's a big thing to understand that the phone is frozen in time, so treat it only as a stepping stone.
02:01:18 <TheJollyRoger> You've already bought and paid for that phone so if this is what you want to do, then this is something you can do with it.
02:02:37 <whereami[m]> OK I will do that. Thx. Once I make lots of money from my exploits on the pixel 2 I'll buy a new pixel that graphene officially supports. I appreciate the time you all have given me & understanding usage cases
02:03:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, good luck.
02:06:49 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I'm gonna take off for a bit. See you guys soon!
02:07:14 <Guest49112> when i go to execute the batch file to install the new os it tells me ./flash-all.bat is not recognized as an internal or external command
02:07:49 <Guest49112> I don't know if this is for help or not
02:20:41 <Thatcher[m]> Which is more secure for receiving sms, the default graphene messages app or signal?
02:22:39 <jameshandcockand> Literally neither
02:22:50 <jameshandcockand> Unless the other person is also using Signal
02:22:55 <jameshandcockand> SMS is not secure
02:22:57 <Thatcher[m]> Does the graphene sms app use system hardening?
02:23:14 <jameshandcockand> It's just the AOSP SMS app
02:23:22 <jameshandcockand> There's nothing to really harden for it specifically lol
02:23:33 <jameshandcockand> It's SMS, which is insecure
02:23:50 <jameshandcockand> An app is not going to make SMS secure
02:25:11 <Thatcher[m]> I understand that, but what if someone sends me a malicious sms to my phone. I want to know if there is extra hardening in Graphene's aosp messages app that would protect my phone from an sms exploit
02:25:37 <Thatcher[m]> It's not a question about the protocols
02:25:42 <Thatcher[m]> Or encryption
02:25:43 <jameshandcockand> What is a malicious SMS
02:25:52 <jameshandcockand> Like cyberbullying?
02:26:29 <jameshandcockand> How would the AOSP SMS protect against a currently unknown SMS vulnerability my man
02:26:53 <Thatcher[m]> How do I ask questions here without getting trolled?
02:27:07 <Pavot[m]> his answer is genuine.
02:27:23 <Pavot[m]> "how would you defend against an unknown vulnerability", obviously all known vulnerabilities are patched
02:27:32 <jameshandcockand> Your questions just don't make sense fam, also learn 2 google and the search for this chat
02:27:32 <Pavot[m]> you're asking if there's protection against an unknown, pretty sure the answer is no
02:27:46 <jameshandcockand> Literally search the word SMS for this chat and boom your answer will be found several times over
02:32:18 <Thatcher[m]> Thanks
02:36:48 <fastbootissues> Hello all.  I am trying to flash Graphene OS onto my Pixel 4.  I am at the point in the instructions where I need to flash using ./flash-all.sh.  I get this error.  ./flash-all.sh: 22: [: Illegal number: 1:81

05:18:20 <Sam84> Hi, I've got graphene running on pixel 4a. All great. I'm struggling with how to get the calendar app to work? There are no configs to setup account ?
05:20:38 <deappledapple> It's a stu
05:21:00 <deappledapple> It's a stub app backend that meant to be replaced?
05:21:15 <Sam84> Ahh?
05:21:29 <deappledapple> It's just there for compatibility tests reasons
05:22:02 <Sam84> So, I need to download a separate app for calender functions
05:22:15 <usefulname[m]> Some alternatives are Etar Calendar or Simple Calendar (from Simple Mobile Tools)
05:22:19 <somenerd[m]> I believe Etar is suggested
05:22:37 <Sam84> Yeah, I saw that. OK, good to know!

10:18:10 <zknshfr[m]> I got this on grapheneOS yesterday, Android system took 32% of battey. It looks like draining since most of the time that process doesn't use that much battery. Any idea?
10:58:26 <Sf--[m]> Is it possible to customize a graphen OS for a Qubes OS VM?
11:00:09 <Sf--[m]> There is the problem with Qubes OS that Android cannot be installed. But it would be good to have an isolated OS with which you can run and use Google APIs.
11:11:21 <Sf--[m]> I know that Google is not implemented in graphs. This is also good. I am still looking for a way to run normal APIs in a Qubes VM.😄

11:50:14 <Essjay[m]> That's more of an #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  question
11:53:33 <Essjay[m]> <zknshfr[m] "I got this on grapheneOS yesterd"> I haven't seen anything like that on my Pixel 4a. Probably would be good if you provided more details. What apps have you installed, whether you've done any unusual changes.
12:15:59 <zknshfr[m]> <Essjay[m] "I haven't seen anything like tha"> I have the usual apps, mostly from f-droid. Recently I've been using KDEConnect but I don't think that caused the drain. Btw I'm on pixel 4a too.
12:25:12 <Golli[m]> KDEConnect constantly runs in the background.
12:26:04 <Golli[m]> Even if it's not the main source of the battery drain, it's assisting it.
12:26:51 <somenerd[m]> this convo is offtopic, maybe move there
12:31:52 <fll[m]> <zknshfr[m] "I got this on grapheneOS yesterd"> Did you have bad signal? I don't know if that is still a thing, but back in the days phones would drain their batteries quite fast trying to establish connections when there was no/bad signal
12:43:21 <zknshfr[m]> <Golli[m] "Even if it's not the main source"> Yes, but it should be under the KDEConnect usage not Android system, right?
12:43:56 <zknshfr[m]> <fll[m] "Did you have bad signal? I don't"> I don't think so since I'm in the same city/building... the signal is the same as always.

14:06:27 <def0> win 10
14:07:27 <mynacol[m]> def0: Read the section about USB cables: https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
14:08:56 <def0> thanks. I hope the cable is fine, it's USB-C which came with the phone
14:09:21 <mynacol[m]> def0: Try another port if possible
14:10:15 <mynacol[m]> def0: You could try to search for windows updates. Then look out for a small "optional updates" tab on the windows update page
14:12:03 <mynacol[m]> def0: In any case, you should be able to hear the "connection" sound from windows after plugging in the phone
14:16:44 <def0> it works fine (adb or file transfer) when OS is booted
14:17:07 <def0> but in boot loader it looks like it is disconnected (no windows sound)
14:17:44 <def0> Is "Console: DISABLED" ok?
14:19:35 <mynacol[m]> def0: Did you check for optional windows updates? There may be an "Android ..." optional driver "update"
14:20:13 <mynacol[m]> def0: Not sure about Console: DISABLED
14:21:06 <def0> d'oh
14:21:12 <def0> missed the line when you wrote it before
14:21:26 <def0> noob mistakes, thanks!
14:47:22 <def0> installed, thanks again
14:47:28 <def0> bye
15:59:30 <noobexterminator> Yo guys
16:00:49 <noobexterminator> Im thinking to buy a Pixel 2xl and install grapheneOS how do i bypass the Google Account sign in when you first power your phone on?
16:01:41 <noobexterminator> Plz help i am a Noob to this Degoogled lifestyle
16:08:21 <take_a_deep_brea> <noobexterminator "Im thinking to buy a Pixel 2xl a"> please do not go for a pixel 2 whatever . they are no more supported in the sense that up to date grapheneos builds wont be made for them
16:08:52 <take_a_deep_brea> take a look at : https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
16:10:00 <take_a_deep_brea> right now 4a is the most economical device and will be supported for the longest time
16:11:38 <take_a_deep_brea> if you dont mind paying for a flagship device and waiting for stable releases , or feel a bit adventurous then you could get a pixel 4a 5G or a pixel 5 as builds for these devices are in testing right now and may make it to the stable release in the future
16:11:54 <take_a_deep_brea> right now pixel 4a is the recommended device
16:13:29 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I personally just skipped the setting up network part
16:13:33 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> But, afaik, Pixel 2(XL) is EOL, no?
16:13:42 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
16:14:13 <take_a_deep_brea> no in fact it is dead , lmao
16:15:14 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Pixel 2 (XL) is no longer supported
16:15:19 * SkyFox[kdeorg][m uploaded an image: image.png (45KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/kde.org/de9ba361ad2f2d1e5afd0f1abc4594885fe284a9/image.png >
16:16:25 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah , no more firmware updates , so no bug fixes , so i leave it to the imagination
16:19:20 <nscnt[m]> noobexterminator3000: There is no "bypass" needed. You don't need a Google Account to set up the phone on stock Android.
16:20:08 <noobexterminator> So how do i use the phone anonymously
16:20:11 <wesder4[m]> How much longer does the Pixel 3xl have?
16:20:44 <nscnt[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
16:22:26 <noobexterminator> But if i sign in a google account now google knows someone is using this device
16:22:29 <nscnt[m]> Once a phone is supported by GrapheneOS, it'll be supported as long as upstream and manufacturers support it with updates and patches.
16:22:59 <nscnt[m]> noobexterminator3000: As I said... You don't need a Google Account
16:23:36 <noobexterminator> No like when you first get a pixel phone it tells you to sign in your google account
16:23:42 <nscnt[m]> No
16:23:51 <nscnt[m]> It doesn't
16:23:55 <nscnt[m]> You can log in. You don't need to
16:23:55 <wesder4[m]> Ahh gotcha, wasn't sure if GrapheneOS had a different cadence for EOL
16:24:14 <noobexterminator> Ok
16:24:18 <noobexterminator> Thanks bro
16:24:53 <noobexterminator> 👍
16:28:55 <noobexterminator> Google Pixel 3a XL 64GB | 4G LTE (FACTORY UNLOCKED BOOTLOADER) 6.0in
16:30:29 <noobexterminator> Is that good
16:38:36 <take_a_deep_brea> noobexterminator3000:  please take a look at this https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones
16:39:31 <take_a_deep_brea> 3a XL will only be supported for a lttle more than a year .
16:40:59 <take_a_deep_brea> 4a also has much  better specs for a very reasonable price . i wont push this point further
16:41:08 <take_a_deep_brea> just trying to help you ; 0
16:41:16 <take_a_deep_brea>  * just trying to help you ; )
16:46:57 <nscnt[m]> I don't know where you found that, but I wouldn't trust it at all if it's offered with a "factory unlocked bootloader." That's not what you get from a reputable dealer. What you need is a not-carrier-locked phone. Then you'll be able to enable OEM unlocking and unlock the bootloader
16:47:23 <nscnt[m]> And everything take_a_deep_breath said
16:47:26 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah , didnt notice that did i !
16:48:11 <take_a_deep_brea>  * oh yeah , didnt notice that did i !(in reference to bootloader unlockes)
16:48:19 <take_a_deep_brea>  * oh yeah , didnt notice that did i !(in reference to bootloader unlocked)
16:48:38 <agentgb[m]> Hey quick question. I am trying to set up a shortcut to add a signature to a text. I am using the personal dictionary like I did on the iphone and then a shortcut phrase but it does not seem to work. Is this something that will not work in GOS. I am new to this so apologies if this is a worn out question.
16:49:32 <take_a_deep_brea> agentgb:   , certainly isnt a worn out question
16:49:40 <nscnt[m]> Never been asked before. I do not know
16:50:54 <agentgb[m]> Yea I am a Realtor and we aqre required to provide our DRE# in our first exchange with a potential client so it is just so much easier to have a shortcut since there does not seem to be a way to do auto signature in Signal or any other app I have found.
16:58:29 <nscnt[m]> agentgb: Seems like it's just primitive. Looks like the shortcut needs to be a prefix of the word itself.
17:00:05 <agentgb[m]> Oh, I will try that.
17:01:21 <nscnt[m]> Numbers doesn't seem to work
17:01:29 <agentgb[m]> Yep, that's it.
17:01:44 <nscnt[m]> Did it work or is it a number?
17:01:49 <agentgb[m]> Yea but I put DRE in first so it works.
17:01:53 <nscnt[m]> Nice
17:06:54 <blk> I guess spaces aren't allowed either?
17:07:04 <agentgb[m]> Super clunky but I made it work.
17:07:10 <agentgb[m]> Yea, no spaces.
17:08:12 <nscnt[m]> It's spellchecking words. Is there a language that has words with spaces in between?
17:09:54 <agentgb[m]> No. For its purpose I guess it works fine. For what I am trying to do it is clunky.
17:11:42 <nscnt[m]> agentgb: Make a "Note to Self" on Signal to copy your signature or something
17:14:22 <blk> Not words, but phrases, yes. :/
17:14:44 <blk> just wondering
17:14:50 <crm971[m]> Hello,
17:14:50 <crm971[m]> I have a technical problem, should I fire away here or start a new room? Never used matrix before
17:15:46 <blk> right here
17:18:31 <crm971[m]> Sweet as. Okay so I asked this on reddit already but here goes. Me and my friend both have a pixel 3a. We both have problems with notifications being late as all hell and also file uploads, however his has persisted for 9 solid months, mine has been somewhat intermittent
17:19:53 <blk> notifications for what?
17:20:24 <crm971[m]> mainly messaging apps: SMS, signal, facebook messenger and whatsapp
17:21:03 <crm971[m]> and also e-mail can take days to come through. This problem is on cellular with different sim cards, and on wi-fi too
17:21:49 <mynacol[m]> Hey, has some an idea what I have misconfigured? I set dark mode to schedule with sunrise/sunset. But the system stays always at light theme.
17:21:49 <mynacol[m]> I did restrict many permissions for system apps, so this may be the cause.
17:22:28 <mynacol[m]> * Hey, has someone an idea what I have misconfigured? I set dark mode to schedule with sunrise/sunset. But the system stays always at light theme.
17:22:28 <mynacol[m]> I did restrict many permissions for system apps, so this may be the cause.
17:22:43 <blk> crm971[m]: For signal, have you done what's described in https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318711-Troubleshooting-Notifications ?
17:23:02 <crm971[m]> Nope I will try that now
17:26:52 <crm971[m]> Okay I've gone through that stuff and its all up to date and configured right
17:26:53 <blk> Most apps are using FCM for push notification which requires Google APIs. Some apps provide an alternative (Signal) but generally you have to allow the app to run in the background to work correctly.
17:27:53 <blk> I would be very surprised if Facebook or WhatsApp (yuck!) will receive push notifications at all.
17:29:18 <crm971[m]> A friend of mine use uses graphene said there was some kind of notification manager I can use to augment that functionality, is that correct?
17:29:40 <snooopy> mynacol[m]: On github is an issue about it: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/225
17:33:18 <blk> crm971[m]: Not to my knowledge. You should be looking for apps which do not require Google services, frankly.
17:34:28 <crm971[m]> As much as its something to aspire to, many people are not on the platforms they should be on. And like I have said this applies to apps which do not use google services as well. Notably my friend's e-mail app
17:34:46 <agentgb[m]> Are you only allowed like one app install a day from Aurora store? Seems like I get one done and then the rest just do not work.
17:35:03 <crm971[m]> not to mention this still doesn't solve my file upload issue
17:35:08 <nscnt[m]> agentgb: Nah, it's just unreliable
17:35:24 <Lachlan[m]> crm971: I use a self-hosted gotify server for most of my notifications.
17:35:26 <nscnt[m]> We have #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org btw
17:35:43 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic for irc
17:37:43 <blk> crm971[m]: what email app?
17:37:50 <agentgb[m]> OK, I moved over there. Thanks.
17:39:31 <nscnt[m]> We are not responsible for how apps implement their notification capabilities
17:40:05 <crm971[m]> defalt app on grapheneos insofar as I can tell
17:41:02 <nscnt[m]> There's no mail app bundled with GrapheneOS
17:41:57 <crm971[m]> Its justcalled 'email', I don't remember where its from
17:42:15 <crm971[m]> whats an email app you recommend?
17:42:24 <nscnt[m]> We aren't the support for their apps
17:42:42 <nscnt[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
17:43:23 <nscnt[m]> their -> developer of the app
17:43:54 <crm971[m]> Okay I will continue discussion in offtopic
17:49:13 <Benno57> He guys, I have a brand new pixel 4a and I am stuck at this step: Wait for the flashing process to complete and proceed to locking the bootloader before using the device as locking wipes the data again.
17:49:46 <Benno57> it says in the windows terminal " waiting for any device""
17:50:09 <Benno57> How long does take?
17:56:00 <theyryu> I am unable to create new user profiles on graoheneos, is this normal?
17:56:12 <theyryu> When I click add an account, nothing happens.
18:00:10 <nscnt[m]> theyryu: That's not adding a user profile. In Settings > System > (Advanced) > Multiple users
18:00:36 <nscnt[m]> Benno57: It's not flashing. The phone isn't recognized
18:00:52 <nscnt[m]> Benno57: What operating system are you flashing from?
18:37:48 <Toves> I'm attempting to flash grapheneOS to a Pixel 4a using Windows 10. I'm stuck at 'Waiting for any device' after entering the command 'fastboot flashing unlock’
18:41:48 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <Toves "I'm attempting to flash graphene"> Installing Android USB drivers fixed this for me:
18:44:04 <Toves> I (attempted) to download and install the Google drivers, and also downloaded and installed Universal Drivers. Either that didn't install properly, or drivers aren't the problem.
18:44:33 <blk> Toves: with the phone loaded into the bootloader and connected enter `fastboot devices` in the terminal. If your device is not listed then open Device Manager and find your device. If it has a yellow exclamation point indiciating that the drivers are not installed then that is your problem.
18:45:49 <Toves> Yes, there is a yellow exclamation point (now). When I last attempted this a couple of days ago, it said that I had the most up to date drivers, but now it's showing a yellow triangle with an exclamation point.
18:46:33 <mynacol[m]> snooopy: Thanks. I missed that
18:50:21 <blk> Toves: note that it uses different drivers to interface with the bootloader than the OS
18:50:53 <blk> so it will appear differently in device manager depending on what is running
18:51:35 <Toves> How then can I tell for sure whether or not missing drivers is the problem?
18:52:41 <Toves> I installed a universal driver package today, but it's still not working.
18:54:18 <deappledapple> Perhaps it is a cable or usb port quality problem?
18:56:21 <Toves> My Pixel 4a didn't come with an USB A to C cable, so I bought the best one I could find. I've heard that the Pixel 4 is very finicky about not working with sub-standard cables. Doesn't work at all, I've heard, if the cable isn't adequate.
18:57:19 <Toves> Is there a way of confirming whether or not the usb port or cable is the problem?
18:57:41 <blk> Toves: what driver did you install?
18:58:25 <blk> and what does device manager report in the Device Status text box?
18:58:58 <Toves> UniversalAdbDriverSetup.msi
19:00:02 <Toves> I'm checking it now.
19:00:34 <blk> I would try using the official driver from Google instead
19:01:34 <blk> according to github the driver you found is 6 years old
19:01:49 <blk> and (of course) unofficial
19:03:35 <Toves> I'll try installing uptodate Google drivers.
19:04:01 <Toves> Thanks for the help!
19:43:33 <Toves> Still trying to flash GrapheneOS to Pixel 4a using Windows. The best that I could do to find the most authentic and up-to-date drivers was to download a driver package called usb_driver_r13-windows from https://developer.android.com.
19:43:33 <Toves> When I go into Device Manager, find my phone, and right click, it says "Windows has determined that the best driver for this device is already installed. There may be better drivers on Windows Update or on the device manufacturer's website' And it shows MTP USB Device.
19:43:33 <Toves> PS C:\adb\platform-tools> adb reboot bootloader
19:43:33 <Toves> PS C:\adb\platform-tools> fastboot flashing unlock
19:43:33 <Toves> < waiting for any device >
19:44:11 <Toves> Can you recommend a better source of drivers?
19:53:37 <blk> Toves99: make sure device manager recognizes the driver *while the phone is running the boot loader*
19:53:50 <blk> Toves: ^
20:01:34 <Knull[m]> permissions removed from an app not used in a while - hadn't seen that before, that's pretty cool.
20:01:39 <Knull[m]> That stock or gos?
20:04:16 <Toves> blk: I checked Device Manager while the phone is running the bootloader, and it shows the Pixel 4a with a yellow triange with an exclamation point icon. That means there's a driver problem, right?
20:05:07 <Toves> I don't know where I can get a newer or more authentic driver.
20:05:49 <strcat[m]> Toves: installing random drivers was a mistake
20:07:25 <strcat[m]> Toves: you're also clearly not following our official install guide
20:07:46 <Toves> Was this last driver package that I used to update the drivers ( usb_driver_r13-windows from https://developer.android.com) the right one? Or a mistake? Even if I was prepared to reinstall the entire operating system and start over, I don't know what drivers to install.
20:07:57 <strcat[m]> it seems you've made the mistake of following misguided third party instructions that lead to messing up your computer and the phone
20:08:03 <strcat[m]> the only guide you should have followed is https://grapheneos.org/install
20:08:15 <strcat[m]> the official guide does not use adb, and it does not have you do what you've been doing
20:08:38 <strcat[m]> Toves: following https://grapheneos.org/install works, following random unofficial guides leads to messing things up
20:09:47 <Toves> I started by following a YouTube video, realized that I should have been working from the website, and changed to working from the official website, but it's very technical. Guess I need to start over from the beginning.
20:13:06 <strcat[m]> Toves: starting over from the beginning now that you've installed weird drivers from GitHub, etc.
20:13:11 <strcat[m]> means on a new computer
20:13:22 <strcat[m]> unless you figure out how to undo everything
20:14:04 <noobexterminator> How easy is it putting GrapheneOS on a Pixel 3a XL
20:14:39 <Pavot[m]> Honestly the hardest part is setting up android-tools to work correctly, past that it's really a breeze.
20:15:02 <Pavot[m]> i would say very easy
20:15:02 <strcat[m]> noobexterminator3000: see https://grapheneos.org/install
20:15:17 <Pavot[m]> but it depends on your familiarly with the tools
20:15:23 <Pavot[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install walks you through the whole thing, you can really just follow simple steps
20:15:28 <strcat[m]> you don't have to be familiar with them
20:15:34 <Pavot[m]> jinx :)
20:15:34 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to do anything not listed there
20:15:42 <noobexterminator> Im like a Mega Noob
20:15:46 <strcat[m]> doing your own thing is how you screw up
20:15:53 <strcat[m]> don't follow unofficial guides and don't come up with your own approach
20:15:59 <strcat[m]> unless you actually know what you're doing already
20:16:04 <strcat[m]> copy-pasting what's there works
20:16:10 <noobexterminator> Ok i will try
20:16:15 <Toves> That's what I'll do. I'll go expressly from the offial guide, starting from square one.
20:18:09 <strcat[m]> Toves: won't work if you don't undo what you already did
20:18:33 <Toves> I'm going to do it on a different computer.
20:19:24 <Toves> strcat[m]: I'll try it on a Linux computer. I have one, but more familiar with Windows
20:21:39 <noobexterminator> https://grapheneos.org/install
20:22:23 <noobexterminator> I think thats the link
20:22:56 <Toves> Noobexterninator: Thanks for the link.
20:22:58 <fire_free[m]> On reddit a bot reindexed me in this group. Hello everyone. I've read the documentation on the GraoheneOS website but one thing is not clear to me. Sorry if it's my fault I don't understand it. So in summary it's better to use cloudflare dns?
20:23:46 <strcat[m]> fire_free: not sure where you're getting the impression that the GrapheneOS website gives that recommendation
20:23:49 <strcat[m]> it definitely doesn't
20:23:53 <strcat[m]> you seem confused
20:23:58 <strcat[m]> recommend rereading the documentation on the site
20:24:01 <strcat[m]> don't skim
20:25:45 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-dns
20:25:50 <strcat[m]> it explains that the network-provided DNS servers are used by default
20:26:07 <strcat[m]> I recommend sticking with the default
20:26:22 <abdulocracy> Can't imagine a network that doesn't provide DNS servers
20:26:28 <strcat[m]> if there was a better option that wouldn't be the default
20:26:44 <strcat[m]> abdulocracy: yes which unfortunately some people don't seem to understand and think we actually use Cloudflare DNS anywhere in practice
20:27:01 <strcat[m]> tried very hard to make this clear in the documentation
20:27:21 <strcat[m]> it's part of the misinformation people have spread about GrapheneOS to try attacking it and it's just plain stupid
20:27:41 <abdulocracy> With popularity this sort of thing is inevitable
20:27:50 <strcat[m]> the fallback is for a really screwed up network where you need to use something very widely available
20:27:52 <abdulocracy> No matter how well you phrase it
20:28:31 <strcat[m]> it would probably be better to leave the fallback matching AOSP but changing it saves developer time/energy from not dealing with even more misinformation/attacks
20:28:34 <abdulocracy> Kind of like the sIGnal crAcKEd bbY iSRAel thing from a while ago
20:29:14 <mynacol[m]> I understand the choice setting Cloudflare as fallback
20:30:00 <abdulocracy> I can't imagine the misinformed backlash had you kept the default
20:30:17 <fire_free[m]> <strcat[m] "fire_free: not sure where you're"> Thank you for your response. I may have gotten my question wrong.... The way I expressed myself it sounded like the site recommended it. Thanks again. Because "custom" dns create fingerprints right? And it is better not to use them?
20:30:38 <abdulocracy> "Google backdoor in GrapheneOS discovered"
20:30:40 <strcat[m]> fire_free: just use the default
20:30:53 <strcat[m]> abdulocracy: people aren't going to get sarcasm either
20:31:07 <strcat[m]> fire_free: it's all explained there
20:31:15 <strcat[m]> the default is already the best option
20:31:18 <strcat[m]> if it wasn't we'd change it
20:31:47 <strcat[m]> the reason the FAQ has so much info on DNS is because people kept asking questions about it
20:31:53 <strcat[m]> it's not because there's anything worth changing
20:32:16 <strcat[m]> the FAQ doesn't reflect what's important and what's the focus of the OS at all
20:32:21 <strcat[m]> but rather the questions that come up again and again
20:32:55 <fire_free[m]> You're absolutely right 😔 it's just that using the translator I didn't want to get it wrong and needed confirmation. Sorry again
20:34:00 <fire_free[m]> I know I should learn English well....
20:34:36 <mynacol[m]> fire_free: Don't be sorry. @strcat:matrix.org just uses direct words. You got your answers. No shame in asking :)

20:43:15 <strcat[m]> it's an example used as part of providing the answer
20:43:39 <mrmccall[m]> What VPN do you recommend?
20:44:02 <strcat[m]> the project doesn't have a VPN recommendation and the answer would depend on what you what to achieve
20:44:13 <strcat[m]> using a VPN vs. not using a VPN similarly depends on what you want to achieve
20:44:21 <strcat[m]> it generally makes sense to use one when considering the tradeoffs
20:44:45 <strcat[m]> in general we don't recommend apps or service providers
20:44:59 <mrmccall[m]> Anonymity
20:45:09 <justanotherlurke> The confusion results from one specific app being mentioned as being able to do something (SOCKS5 forwarding) that is being recommended against a few sentences before. So I was uncertain if that was meant to be some kind of (unexplained) exception and I had not understood the whole issue correctly.
20:45:26 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: the FAQ is not giving you recommendations
20:45:35 <strcat[m]> unless it specifically says something is a recommendation
20:45:36 <strcat[m]> it's explaining things
20:45:53 <strcat[m]> the FAQ explaining how to do something is not an indication that it is a good idea to do it
20:46:06 <strcat[m]> explaining how to configure custom DNS via DNS-over-TLS is not a recommendation to use DNS-over-TLS
20:46:07 <strcat[m]> etc
20:46:22 <strcat[m]>  * explaining how to configure custom DNS via DNS-over-TLS is not a recommendation to use a custom DNS server, etc.
20:46:29 <strcat[m]> it explains various topics and the tradeoffs
20:46:46 <strcat[m]> it is not a list of recommendations or best practices except where it explicitly says something is one
20:46:59 <strcat[m]> it's an FAQ, not a guide on best practices / recommendations
20:47:18 <strcat[m]> the FAQ talking about something existing is not the FAQ telling you to use it
20:47:35 <strcat[m]> unless it says "you should", "we recommend", etc. then it's not recommending something
20:47:56 <mrmccall[m]> How many different ways are you going yo say the same thing? Lol
20:48:04 <strcat[m]> until it's understood
20:48:05 <mrmccall[m]> * How many different ways are you going to say the same thing? Lol
20:48:56 <strcat[m]> mrmccall: you'll need to be more clear about what you want to achieve
20:49:06 <strcat[m]> mrmccall: anonymity from whom?
20:49:33 <strcat[m]> mrmccall: it *often* makes sense for people to use a *widely used* VPN provider as an always-on VPN across their system
20:49:36 <mrmccall[m]> <strcat[m] "mrmccall: anonymity from whom?"> ISP and their behavior algorithms
20:49:53 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "the FAQ explaining *how* to do s"> That was the reason for my confusion. The FAQ explicitly seem to recommend AdGuard DNS as (one) example and then switch a little later into explanation mode, mentioning NetGuard and only "implicitly" (by the explanation before) making clear that its use is not recommended.
20:50:12 <strcat[m]> no, we don't recommend Adguard DNS
20:50:23 <strcat[m]> you're confusing examples with recommendations
20:50:23 <mrmccall[m]> Lol you both keep saying the exact same things
20:50:28 <mynacol[m]> Regarding VPNs: @strcat:matrix.org
20:50:42 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: I don't see anything that could be interpreted as a recommendation to use adguard dns
20:50:56 <mynacol[m]>  * Regarding NetGuard: @strcat:matrix.org already discussed this yesterday: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210120#c6598711
20:51:07 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "you're confusing examples with r"> Exactly. That's why I asked for clarification.
20:51:23 <strcat[m]> > As an example, AdGuard DNS can be used by setting dns.adguard.com as the Private DNS domain.
20:51:26 <strcat[m]> this isn't a recommendation
20:51:43 <strcat[m]> we arbitrarily choose an example of a DNS provider doing content filtering as an example
20:51:54 <schmidt> hey guys im having issues with mz pixel 4a and wifi connection i can connect to mz wifi but nothing works is this a GraphenOs Issue *somekinda server issue
20:52:02 <strcat[m]> similarly to how we used `one.one.one.one` as an example of a DNS-over-TLS server (Cloudflare DNS)
20:52:06 <strcat[m]> it is NOT a recommendation to use it
20:52:17 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: if it was recommended, it would just be the default
20:52:26 <mrmccall[m]> I think ProtonVPN might be the best choice because they are not in the five eyes.
20:52:32 <RamenLover> Hey so I'm trying to use some mainstream apps like banking and VIP access for my job, but I want to spoof my data. I understand aurora does it but Ik guessing its only for when I'm using aurora store
20:52:50 <strcat[m]> mrmccall:  definitely not the kind of reasoning that the project would recommend following
20:52:59 <RamenLover> Anyone know how I can spoof my data for any app?
20:53:09 <fire_free[m]> Honestly said I read the whole faq as a recommendation. And now I realize I was 100% wrong. It's true that I'm stupid and several others too 😂😂 maybe because in some cultures in the world now the faq is considered a divine guide (because site creators didn't even know the difference between faq and recommendation). And I'm not joking. However I understand the stress that it causes to write pages and pages and t
20:53:09 <fire_free[m]> to be asked the same questions
20:53:11 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "justanotherlurker: I don't see a"> I think that many people would read this part as a recommendation:
20:53:16 <strcat[m]> RamenLover: not clear what you're asking to do
20:53:24 <strcat[m]> RamenLover: you can choose what data you enter in to an app
20:53:29 <strcat[m]> and what data you give it access to
20:53:42 <mrmccall[m]> <strcat[m] "mrmccall:  definitely not the ki"> Why not? What is recommended instead?
20:53:47 <RamenLover> I'm talking spoofing it for the trackers attached to appa
20:54:06 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: many people may misinterpret things
20:54:11 <strcat[m]> our recommendation is using the default
20:54:25 <mynacol[m]> schmidt: Is cellular connection working fine?
20:54:43 <strcat[m]> if someone insists on doing system wide adblocking, our recommendation is doing it by configuring DNS-over-TLS with a content filtering DNS server
20:55:03 <strcat[m]> we explain that an app-based implementation will work and that apps doing TLS interception to filter content exist
20:55:08 <strcat[m]> we explain why it's problematic
20:55:28 <strcat[m]> we do not provide a recommendation on a server to use for content filtering via DNS
20:55:30 <strcat[m]> we provide an example
20:55:39 <strcat[m]> the documentation is carefully written
20:55:44 <strcat[m]> if people don't read it carefully, that's on them
20:56:06 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "justanotherlurker: many people m"> Sad, but true ... but at least I have learned by now to better ask and challenge my probably flawed understanding.
20:57:20 <justanotherlurke> Need to be off for a few - thanks again for the clarification and all the work that goes into this great OS.
20:57:47 <fire_free[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: You sound like a bored veteran spelling things out. I love you ❤️❤️❤️.
20:58:47 <mynacol[m]> I'm sure @strcat:matrix.org  is not bored. Love him too <3

21:03:07 <mrmccall[m]> I found your recommendations. Orbot, WireGuard, OpenVPN using PIA client.
21:03:56 <strcat[m]> those are recommendations of apps
21:04:05 <strcat[m]> and you missed 1
21:04:15 <strcat[m]> and no, that's a misinterpretation of what's written there
21:04:44 <strcat[m]> we are not recommending using apps over the built-in OS support
21:05:00 <strcat[m]> I think the FAQ already speaks for itself and I recommend reading it carefullty
21:05:14 <strcat[m]>  * I think the FAQ already speaks for itself
21:05:17 <strcat[m]> please read it carefully instead of skimming it
21:05:47 <strcat[m]> I don't think this is a productive conversation and it should come to a close
21:06:44 <strcat[m]> if after carefully reading the information on the site you have a question about it, ask that here
21:08:08 <strcat[m]> I really don't think it's as hard to understand as people are making it out to be
21:09:05 <strcat[m]> it's not possible to address every possible misinterpretation and misunderstanding
21:09:08 <mrmccall[m]> It literally says "the following open source apps are recommended"
21:09:29 <strcat[m]> yes and it never says that we recommend using app-based VPNs over the built-in OS support
21:09:42 <strcat[m]> I don't think it gives that impression
21:09:51 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have a recommendation either way
21:09:58 <mrmccall[m]> You never say you don't so one can assume your recommendations are recommended.
21:10:07 <strcat[m]> no, you can't assume that
21:10:12 <mrmccall[m]> It is recommended, you say it verbatim.
21:10:28 <strcat[m]> you're misinterpreting what it says
21:10:43 <strcat[m]> we give a list of app-based VPN apps that are high quality
21:10:51 <mrmccall[m]> Yes, you can. Rewrite your FAQ and take out the phrase that you recommend these apps.
21:10:53 <strcat[m]> those are the recommendations for app-based VPNs
21:10:57 <strcat[m]> no
21:11:06 <mrmccall[m]> No, I haven't. You misspoke in your FAQs
21:11:07 <strcat[m]> I won't take out the sentence saying that those are the recommended app-based VPN apps
21:11:15 <strcat[m]> no, we didn't
21:11:18 <strcat[m]> you're misinterpreting it
21:11:47 <mrmccall[m]> Lol
21:12:01 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier I really don't think this is a productive discussion and I think it needs to come to a close
21:12:24 <strcat[m]> this is taking time away from development and I'm going to start interpreting it as concern trolling
21:12:29 <mrmccall[m]> So no VPN where the ISP can get learn your behavior online is your recommendation?
21:12:40 <strcat[m]> mrmccall: did not say that
21:12:45 <strcat[m]> don't know where you're getting these ideas
21:12:50 <strcat[m]> refer to what I already said above in this channel
21:12:59 <came2complain[m]> /don't feed the troll//
21:13:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw I need a couple more testers for pixel 4a 5g and pixel 5, pm me
21:13:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Testers are also needed to install the official beta release with carrierconfig changes and to report back breakages
21:13:05 <strcat[m]> don't put words in my mouth and concern troll or you'll be banned
21:13:06 <came2complain[m]>  * //don't feed the troll//
21:13:12 <mrmccall[m]> They say something. You don't recommend a VPN that says your recommend it, what is the recommendations??
21:13:31 <strcat[m]> read what I already wrote above in this channel

21:14:07 <strcat[m]> mrmccall: okay, please stop
21:14:07 <mynacol[m]> mrmccall: If you should use a VPN is not answerable. There is no recommendation.
21:14:14 <strcat[m]> refer to what I wrote above
21:14:19 <mrmccall[m]> All you said is you don't recommend app based vpns, you never said what you do recommend.
21:14:27 <strcat[m]> I gave an answer above in this channel
21:14:29 <strcat[m]> go read that
21:14:56 <strcat[m]> and what I said about app based VPNs is that we do not specifically recommend them over the built-in OS VPN support
21:14:59 <mynacol[m]> mrmccall: Use a VPN of your liking or don't. It's that easy.
21:15:02 <strcat[m]> we do not specifically recommend either
21:15:12 <mrmccall[m]> The built-in OS support? What is hiding my online traffic from my ISP?
21:15:22 <strcat[m]> and I gave a general answer about whether a VPN makes sense above in this channel
21:15:24 <mrmccall[m]> * The built-in OS support? That is hiding my online traffic from my ISP?
21:15:26 <strcat[m]> I don't know why you're ignoring that
21:15:32 <strcat[m]> /quiet mrmccall
21:15:57 <strcat> mrmccall[m]: just read what was already written
21:16:02 <strcat> scroll up
21:16:04 <strcat> read my answer
21:16:09 <strcat> no more of this
21:17:06 <strcat> if you don't want a nuanced answer, don't ask me questions
21:17:09 <MaximBaz[m]> Hi @strcat:matrix.org, have you had a chance to look at https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/pull/94 ? It's not urgent, just curious if you already have some thoughts 🙂
21:17:17 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tkaPktsKnMNNpnCRPQmVBzzs/message.txt >
21:18:30 <strcat> I hope this discussion also makes it more apparent why it is so time consuming to expand the FAQ
21:18:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> <mrmccall[m] "I don't see an answer, I'm not s"> VPNs are useful in certain situations. The F.A.Q. gives examples of client apps you could use. There are no recommendations for what commercial VPN provider you should use.
21:18:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <MaximBaz[m] "Hi @strcat:matrix.org, have you "> Personally I'd prefer the locked down policy
21:19:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> But you have highlighted a valid problem there
21:19:54 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: the issue with P2P is that when people aren't using a shared VPN server, it reveals their IP (and often, that's fairly tied to location, too) to people they're talking to via WebRTC
21:20:07 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: so there's a real reason to use the policy of not allowing P2P
21:20:19 <strcat> similarly to how Signal has a toggle for disabling P2P for calls
21:20:43 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: I don't think we want to change the default, you would need to add a toggle - people could already change it via chrome://flags afaik
21:22:18 <strcat> mrmccall[m]: above, I already gave information on whether using a VPN makes sense and a recommendation for a general purpose approach
21:22:42 <strcat> it's obscured by a whole bunch of non-productive discussion following it, but it is there
21:23:26 <mrmccall[m]> Great, thanks so much, helps a lot.
21:23:33 <strcat> I am not going to recommend a specific VPN provider or a specific protocol
21:24:01 <MaximBaz[m]> strcat:  makes sense to have it configurable, and if so, the most locked down policy by default! it's not present in chrome://flags in vanadium right now, but are you saying that it could be added there? if so, do you have a pointer or an example for me to have a look how this is done?
21:24:21 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: are you sure it's not?
21:24:32 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: no I think it should be in the regular configuration menu
21:24:38 <strcat> I was just saying that I thought it was already in flags
21:25:01 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: we probably don't have the resources to port this kind of thing to each new version
21:25:08 <strcat> considering that it would be among so many other things
21:25:26 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: my recommendation would be implementing a configuration menu for it and trying to get it added upstream
21:25:38 <strcat> we could potentially have a configuration menu added in Vanadium
21:25:58 <strcat> but I expect it's going to be a non-trivial amount of code, strings, etc. and then that's problematic to keep porting forward
21:26:09 <strcat> I'm not getting enough help with maintaining the existing Vanadium changes
21:26:37 <hypokeimenon[m]> mrmccall: It is not Graphene OS's job to give you recommendations to secure and make private every aspect of your life. Its goals end at leveraging the hardware in your smartphone to secure your operating system. You are being a bit entitled.
21:27:28 <MaximBaz[m]> okay understood, I'll close the PR and have a look into implementing this for the upstream, thanks
21:28:07 <strcat> MaximBaz[m]: we could maintain the added configuration option downstream but... we'd only want to maintain it for Android and then it needs to be really simple and easy to maintain
21:28:15 <strcat> much better to have a cross-platform toggle added upstream
21:28:21 <strcat> but it's probably a fair bit of work
22:02:43 <flossfloss> What can "sandboxing" applications reasonably achieve?
22:02:43 <flossfloss> I have an old phone I want to use for GrapheneOS and use it as my only access point for apps/services such as Messenger (for friends who don't have Signal), TikTok (potentially just the browser version), etc.
22:02:44 <flossfloss> These are apps/services that I don't want to and don't need to access elsewhere. This phone will not have a sim card. I will only be accessing the internet via WiFi or a hotspot from my primary phone.
22:02:44 <flossfloss> I have heard of programs such as Shelter, Insular, and Island. What can these programs do for me from the point of not allowing an application/service to access any information about any other application/service installed on the phone?
22:02:45 <flossfloss> Furthermore, what information can be taken by an app/service about my primary phone (which provides the hotspot) or the network/phone number of my primary phone?
22:10:34 <Essjay[m]> If your old phone isn't on the following list, you won't be installing GrapheneOS on it https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
22:14:45 <billzster> Hey Folks - Seems like the GraphenOS all works well but I do not have an option on dialer that states theres a new voicemail nor an icon on top. - using Verizon. Does anyone have some direction for me. - please
22:21:37 <flossfloss> My old phone is on that list
22:21:46 <frontman[m]> On cricket I have those things
22:21:52 <flossfloss> Essjay[m]
22:22:55 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: all apps are sandboxed by the OS
22:23:30 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: recommend reading the information we have available on our site
22:23:39 <strcat[m]> > I have heard of programs such as Shelter, Insular, and Island.
22:23:54 <strcat[m]> these do not provide a different / improved app sandbox
22:24:21 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: the OS has a concept of profiles, which are separate isolated workspaces
22:24:35 <strcat[m]> the best way to make use of this is by using multiple user profiles
22:25:26 <strcat[m]> each user profile has a separate instance of each app, a separate user storage directory, contacts, etc.
22:25:36 <strcat[m]> apps cannot communicate or share data across user profiles
22:26:03 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: regardless, the same app sandbox is being used
22:26:15 <strcat[m]>  * flossfloss: the app sandbox is the same regardless
22:27:20 <strcat[m]> each user profile can also have a 'work profile' owned by a device management app, which is intended for enterprise management of work profiles for BYOD deployments
22:27:35 <strcat[m]> the semantics of the work profile are up to the device manager app which owns/manages it
22:28:02 <strcat[m]> it can be used in a way that it has separate data and no communication between apps in it and the rest of the user profile
22:28:07 <flossfloss> Thanks strcat, I'll absolutely check out the website in depth, I just had these specific questions that you've covered well.
22:28:08 <flossfloss> In that case, aside from the privacy concerns about what is actually shared in the application (say, a publication on Facebook), are there any other concerns regarding privacy/security that I should be aware of?
22:28:13 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: that's what those apps you're talking about are using
22:28:15 <strcat[m]> work profiles
22:28:28 <strcat[m]> our recommendation is to use user profiles
22:41:40 <billzster> Using Verizon on the Pixel 4 but the voicemail icon on dialer does not show pending voicemails anymore. Can someone suggest a solution.
22:43:01 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> voicemail -> notification->advanced->on/off?
22:43:58 <billzster> Its on "On"
22:45:54 <mynacol[m]> Iirc there are known problems with Verizon because they require to use/include in system some proprietary apps
22:46:22 <flossfloss> In your opinions, is there any privacy/security benefit of having a separate phone without a sim card (on grapheneos) for certain applications, as opposed to using user profiles on one primary phone (with a sim card)?
22:46:31 <mynacol[m]> For some functionality, at least
22:49:30 <billzster> Thats tough - Remembering to check VM via *86 is my failure and I have had clients upset with me. So are we concluding that using GraphenOS there can not be a Verizon alert with VMs yet.
22:59:08 <blk>  billzster: I would contact Verizon and see if they have options for, e.g., voicemail forwarding
22:59:23 <blk> otherwise I can confirm that it's working fine on Mint Mobile
23:02:58 <strcat[m]> the next release of GrapheneOS includes a bunch of extra carrier-specific configuration overrides
23:03:08 <strcat[m]> to work around quirks and non-standard functionality with different carriers
23:06:18 <billzster> Great News!
23:07:05 <strcat> should fix visual voicemail issues with US carriers
23:07:07 <billzster> I did notice where it says carrier for me the name is "your carrier" not Verizon or something else
23:07:14 <strcat> other US carrier issues won't be fixed due to dependencies on bloatware apps
23:07:24 <strcat> but elsewhere in the world it should fix most issues
23:07:25 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> flossfloss : i dont't think it change a lot
23:07:43 <strcat> billzster: because they've got a really screwed up setup
23:07:59 <strcat> the OS needs to have thousands of lines of configuration working around all that stuff
23:08:12 <strcat> billzster: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Dialer/commit/0d8292da5563eec6014986a126bc7affcd0a0310
23:08:47 <strcat[m]> so for example, a lot of these carriers need TLS disabled for them
23:08:52 <strcat[m]> in order for their voicemail service to work
23:08:59 <strcat[m]>     <string-array name="vvm_disabled_capabilities_string_array">
23:09:00 <strcat[m]>       <item value="STARTTLS" />
23:09:00 <strcat[m]>     </string-array>
23:09:13 <strcat[m]> billzster: US carriers are (mostly) trash
23:09:17 <strcat[m]> T-Mobile seems like the least bad by far
23:09:34 <strcat[m]> Sprint was the worst by far but is thankfully going away
23:09:38 <strcat[m]> Verizon is the next worst
23:10:01 <strcat[m]> these issues are largely US specific
23:10:56 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/device_google_sunfish/commit/3ca4312db4bcc99fc629eb7e87f8303fffee28f2#diff-d7fb4c78ce6da621e92b4ff90608a8e2ddcd87fb3a83edc32f08ea5dca9430a2
23:11:29 <strcat[m]> 16k lines of additional carrier configuration overrides beyond APN configuration
23:11:38 <strcat[m]> thanks to them not simply following standards
23:11:55 <billzster> WOW....I see what you mean on the code. This will hopefully be added in next release - not something I would do correct?
23:12:01 <strcat[m]> this would be longer but we had to strip out most US carriers due to them dependency on proprietary apps
23:12:10 <strcat[m]>  * this would be longer but we had to strip out most US carriers due to them depending on proprietary apps
23:12:31 <strcat[m]> so we can't include the additional carrier specific configuration overrides since it's unclear which parts depend on those apps
23:13:32 <billzster> GraphenOS is fantastic - I am happy to wait
23:13:37 <strcat[m]> the visual voicemail issues for various US carriers should get fixed
23:13:40 <strcat[m]> other stuff won't
23:13:57 <strcat[m]> but after the next release pretty much any carrier outside the US should have full functionality
23:14:01 <strcat[m]> we'll see how beta testing goes
23:14:11 <strcat[m]> been working on stuff like the Vanadium port to Chromium 88
23:14:19 <strcat[m]> so that has delayed the release
23:14:26 <billzster> At least now I know its not something I was failing to do
23:14:49 <strcat[m]> billzster: the issue is Verizon is screwed up and invented their own voicemail system which they don't properly implement
23:16:33 <M1f4a9[m]> https://shadow53.com/android/no-gapps/faq/location-services-not-working/ "There was also a change in Android 7.0 that prevents user apps from being network location providers. [...] In order to use the location provider portion of microG or UnifiedNlp on these systems, the app needs to be installed as a system app."
23:16:33 <M1f4a9[m]> When GrapheneOS will support installing microG in the future, it will not be as system user, right? Will there be any way to make UnifiedNlp work safely? IMHO one of the biggest drawbacks of using GrapheneOS now is that it can only do pure GPS location, which is terribly slow and doesn't work under many conditions.
23:17:03 <strcat> M1f4a9[m]: we won't be supporting microG as a location provider
23:17:19 <strcat> non-GPS-based location detection is a separate project
23:17:33 <strcat> not something we are going to tie to having an implementation of Google services
23:18:01 <strcat> help wanted
23:19:08 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "Maxim Baz: the issue with P2P is"> Fun fact, thats why signal provides a toggle to route calls through their servers
23:19:10 <flossfloss> ArrayIndexOutOfB To your knowledge, can applications access information about the sim card such as phone number?
23:19:16 <M1f4a9[m]> Would that be sort of a stand-alone implementation based on UnifiedNlp code?
23:19:23 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: yeah mentioned that in my messages
23:19:31 <strcat> M1f4a9[m]: it won't be based on that
23:19:33 <ch3ster> Hello, I am trying to do a backup of the phone. I have usb accessories set to 'allow new usb peripherals'. I have Usb preferences 'use usb for' set to file transfer. I have tried midi, ptp too. However, anytime I tried opening the Backup in system settings,it only lists my phone, nextcloud (click to install) and usb flash drive (which is greyed out). I assumed I could just plug it into my computer and it would work?
23:19:41 <strcat> M1f4a9[m]: help is wanted with implementing it
23:20:33 <strcat> ch3ster: the USB mode in the notification isn't relevant to using a USB peripheral like a flash drive, setting it to file transfer is to allow the attached computer to access the profile's home directory
23:20:59 <strcat> ch3ster: changing our added USB peripheral setting from the default also isn't needed, the default is disallowing adding USB peripherals while locked (except at boot)
23:21:08 <M1f4a9[m]> strcat: What will it be based on? Unfortunately it is nowhere near my capabilities to write such a thing from scratch
23:21:15 <strcat> ch3ster: so, neither of those is relevant or helpful unless you're trying to connect it when locked
23:22:08 <strcat> ch3ster: Seedvault can't back up to your computer directly
23:22:11 <ch3ster> strcat, okay thats good to know, about the usb peripherals settings. thank you. any suggestions on what I should do? I didnt find any instructions on website..
23:22:22 <strcat> ch3ster: back up to one of the available options
23:22:35 <strcat> if you want to copy the backup from the profile's home directory to your computer, you can do that
23:22:40 <strcat> you could also copy it from a flash drive
23:23:04 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> flossfloss : without consent?
23:23:06 <ch3ster> ohh okay. so like a usb type c converter to regular usb stick would work then?
23:23:14 <strcat> ch3ster: yes one comes with the phone
23:23:15 <strcat> in the box
23:23:29 <strcat> ch3ster: alternatively you can back up locally and then transfer that to the computer
23:23:52 <ch3ster> strcat, ahh gotcha, okay thanks. i bought it used so i didnt get anything but the phone. had to buy charger and cable afterwards.
23:23:57 <strcat[m]> also keep in mind Seedvault currently only backs up OS / app data, not the profile's home directory
23:24:02 <strcat[m]> you need to back that up yourself atm
23:24:29 <ch3ster> strcat, ahh okay thats cool, thanks. ill try that now. is there a guide anywhere on how to do that properly,. as im not to familiar yet with gos.
23:24:48 <strcat[m]> no, we don't have a guide
23:24:50 <flossfloss> ArrayIndexOutOfB: Yes. One of my concerns which led to my want of a second phone was keeping my phone number and carrier/etc. "private" from applications like Messenger
23:25:06 <strcat[m]> Seedvault isn't specific to GrapheneOS
23:25:16 <strcat[m]> the person who originally wrote it made it with the intention of it being used by us
23:25:26 <blacklight447[m]> You what i wonder, how do you actually have your phone set up , strcat
23:25:28 <blacklight447[m]> Like, profiles wise
23:25:28 <strcat[m]> but it's not specific to GrapheneOS and isn't a GrapheneOS project
23:25:41 <strcat[m]> blacklight447:  which one of my phones
23:25:42 <ch3ster> strcat[m], okay, thanks for helping me and giving me a start of what and how. I apprecaite your time
23:25:45 <strcat[m]> I have a dozen
23:25:52 <blacklight447[m]> (Just being curious here)
23:26:14 <flossfloss> I can't answer on behalf of strcat[m] but per the grapheneos website, it's best to only use the "main" user profile (or whatever it's called) in order to manage other user profiles
23:26:18 <flossfloss> as opposed to using the main profile directly
23:26:40 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> flossfloss i dont't think app can access without consent
23:26:45 <strcat[m]> we expect most people will use the Owner profile as their main profile
23:27:02 <strcat[m]> but if you want to maximize security it makes sense to use it only for managing other profiles or for use in a pinch
23:27:07 <strcat[m]> as we explain there
23:27:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:27:21 <strcat[m]> best explained by what's written there
23:27:41 <flossfloss> ArrayIndexOutOfB: Thank you. I will keep this in mind and perhaps reconsider keeping the second phone
23:28:36 <ch3ster> strcat[m], ohhh, ya i think i read about it somewhere on slashdot or reddit regarding calyxos seedvault and having a falling out with grapheneos...
23:29:33 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> flossfloss i hope somone can help you, i'm new to this node, probably everyone knows more than me, but im 99% sure
23:30:12 <alantristar[m]> Do sim cards even store phone numbers on them anymore like in old days? Is there a way to read the installed sim?
23:30:56 <flossfloss> ArrayIndexOutOfB: You've definitely helped, I appreciate it. I'm very new to all of this, in fact, this is one of the first time I'm even using IRC, let alone this node.
23:30:58 <datacloud[m]> You won a new GrapheneOS user :-) and I have a short question. After I installed GrapheneOS, I made the startup. No error, everthing looks good. But if I start the system update, no respone like message or similar. Is this ok?
23:31:34 <alantristar[m]> Its been a long time since nexus devices and cyanogen mod. Went down the corporate crackberry and iPhone route for q decade
23:31:41 <flossfloss> alantristar[m] I don't know, I'm trying to look for resources to learn more about this
23:31:51 <ch3ster> datacloud[m], ya thats normal...
23:32:05 <ch3ster> datacloud[m], it notifies me when there is a new update, usually once a month on the stable branch
23:32:38 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> flossfloss i actually think app can't access these thing at all since Android 10 (with/without consent)
23:33:55 <flossfloss> ArrayIndexOutOfB: I was thinking mostly about "bad offenders" like TikTok and Facebook that love to harvest data no matter what and attempt to bypass restrictions. TikTok is not necessary to me, but I find quite a few channels quite entertaining and informative, so if there is a way I can use it without sacrificing privacy (I don't post anything on
23:33:56 <flossfloss> it), I'll use it
23:34:05 <datacloud[m]> <ch3ster "data.cloud, it notifies me when "> Thanks
23:34:41 <flossfloss> ArrayIndexOutOfB: Then how can apps auto-fill numbers? Also, a lot of apps auto-complete verification codes if you get them sent to you via sms. How do they do this? I'd assume obviously be reading the sms messages some how
23:34:53 <flossfloss> but I don't remember giving sms permissions to these apps, so how do they do it?
23:34:59 <datacloud[m]> Is there a way to check that everthing is ok, or when it's running that it's right to work?
23:38:34 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: there's an API to do it
23:38:54 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> flossfloss Is this a settings on Android? autofill?
23:39:01 <flossfloss> is that API blocked in GrapheneOS?
23:39:02 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "blacklight447:  which one of my "> You don't have anything like a daily driver?
23:39:07 <flossfloss> I will check to see if there is a setting for it
23:39:11 <blacklight447[m]> The phone you like, use the most?
23:39:15 <rny> merning all
23:39:24 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: I think it's a Play services API
23:39:40 <strcat[m]> we don't have Play services
23:39:46 <flossfloss> Ah, in that case, it won't work on GrapheneOS because of no play services
23:39:51 <flossfloss> great, thank you
23:39:58 <strcat[m]> flossfloss: if you gave an app the Phone permission that's how they obtain your number (READ_PHONE_STATE)
23:40:13 <strcat[m]> the SMS auto-verification API is a Play services thing
23:47:05 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> i'm a failure... i read all the time imei instead of phone number
23:52:32 <theychuckthisfro> I've got a question.
23:52:43 <theychuckthisfro> How can I get my phone recognized on my computer with Graphene OS?
23:54:31 <rny> theychuckthisfro: if you're on linux, fix the udev rules
23:54:32 <theychuckthisfro> I want to put some Music onto my phone.
23:54:49 <theychuckthisfro> Udev rules?
23:54:57 <strcat> use mtp
23:56:05 <ArrayIndexOutOfB> theychuckthisfro Google USB driver ? W10?
23:56:18 <strcat> ArrayIndexOutOfB: don't need that for MTP
23:56:27 <strcat> and anyway, you don't need that for fastboot/adb either...
