00:10:58 <Thatcher[m]> If you mess up the install process, can't you just lock and unlock the bootloader for another fresh attempt at flashing?
00:11:10 <Thatcher[m]> Or does it not work that way
00:11:51 <badactor[m]> entry1: I agree, I had no idea I would mess it up...., But I did
00:13:43 <Thatcher[m]> The idea I have is that if unlocking the bootloader wipes out the data on the phone, then locking it and unlocking it again would wipe out the failed installation. Don't try this until someone official chimes in with their 2 cents
00:14:44 <Thatcher[m]> I'm just brainstorming, not experienced with Graphene install errors at all
00:23:29 <badactor[m]> Thatcher: I'd help if I could, but I had someone walk me through it along with reading the tutorial

01:00:53 <anonymous49> Did both rear camera working on pixel 4 XL ?
01:00:57 <anonymous49> I'm going to buy Pixel 4A 5G, and I wondering if both rear camera will work, when GrapheneOS will release for this phone.
01:34:06 <timetravelingman> Will 2021.02.02.09 be pushed soon?
01:35:09 <illustratorius[m> I've been using the Pixel 3 with Graphene for a week and had no problems....Now it  just went into a boot loop for no reason. At 40% charge and only Vanadium was running. After 5 or 6 boot loops, it finally started up.
01:35:10 <illustratorius[m> Is this a known issue?
01:35:38 <rny> no
01:35:48 <rny> did it update?
01:36:11 <illustratorius[m> Perhaps it's a hardware problem
01:37:29 <illustratorius[m> * Perhaps it's a hardware problem
01:37:29 <illustratorius[m> No update yet....still on 1.23.03
01:37:41 <rny> can you get logs
01:38:39 <illustratorius[m> How would I do that?

04:11:13 <Hodge88> Any help?
04:13:58 <b1101> Hodge88: you on windows?
04:14:12 <Hodge88> Yes, windows 10

04:14:31 <Hodge88> Yessir

04:14:55 <Hodge88> *response
04:15:12 <Hodge88> Appreciate the replies, btw
04:15:55 <b1101> can you run the flash-all.bat from within an open powershell window
04:16:55 <b1101> plus at this point you should have your phone in bootloader mode, connected, and windows having the correct driver for it
04:17:45 <Hodge88> Not sure I know how to do the powershell stuff. I'm not much of a power user. With difficulty, I've managed to root a couple devices over the years. Research seemed to indicate the pixel 4a + graphene would be easy peasy way to divorce google.
04:18:38 <b1101> open a powershell window within the directory of the flash-all
04:19:04 <b1101> then just type the command name
04:19:22 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
04:20:49 <Hodge88> What command name do I use?
04:21:08 <Hodge88> (Tried the web installation as well, but none of the buttons achieved connectivity to device)
04:21:08 <b1101> flash-all.bat
04:21:33 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: did you install the driver via Windows update?
04:22:54 <Hodge88> I updated driver via device manager -> pixel4a -> pick from list -> ADB composite
04:23:06 <Hodge88> Thank you for help, sorry I'm a noob
04:23:54 <Hodge88> The powershell command result:

04:24:01 <Hodge88> PS C:\AAA_Filing_Cabinet_JohnC\Pixel4a\platform-tools>
04:24:14 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: it's not an adb driver that's required
04:24:21 <strcat[m]> you're supposed to have the phone in the bootloader menu
04:24:27 <strcat[m]> adb is not used as part of the installation process
04:24:40 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: you're not supposed to ever be in the platform-tools directly for the CLI installation process
04:24:50 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: adb isn't used as part of the installation
04:25:00 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you may have been following incorrect unofficial guides and they led you astray
04:25:28 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: boot phone to bootloader interface (not recovery) and check Windows Update for the fastboot / bootloader driver
04:25:35 <strcat[m]> then use https://grapheneos.org/install/web
04:25:50 <strcat[m]> (or the CLI instructions, but you have to start over and follow them precisely within the same PowerShell session)
04:26:13 <strcat[m]> (i.e. open a new PowerShell and not in a specific directory)
04:26:51 <Hodge88> :-(  I admit I didn't really understand the powershell stuff on the official graphene site - so I watched some youtubes that seemed much more familiar - issuing commands from generic command prompt within platform tools...
04:27:43 <somenerd[m]> probably should've used the web install
04:28:04 <Hodge88> Good news is device isn't bricked yet!
04:28:12 <somenerd[m]> most youtube videos are very misleading
04:28:20 <Hodge88> ...seemed so easy!
04:28:21 <b1101> you have to use powershell if you want to go through the process locally.
04:28:26 <somenerd[m]> and some don't even follow the official install guide
04:28:31 <b1101> ^
04:28:46 <Hodge88> Imma see if I can't get the right drivers
04:29:24 <b1101> does windows show any missing drivers with your device connected in bootloader mode?
04:30:20 <b1101> because the previous error you pasted, was because you tried to run the flash-all.bat from within platform-tools folder; instead of the extracted grapheneos zip; that includes that file
04:30:56 <Hodge88> Actually, when I first connected device to PC, device couldn't be recognized
04:31:26 <Hodge88> Did some googling and found similar issues reported, so did the device manager thing.
04:32:15 <Hodge88> Interestingly, the drivers need to be "updated" in device manager to different things if the device is booted up and running vs in fastboot.
04:32:17 <b1101> so then device manager found the drivers, and now it's recognized
04:32:49 <Hodge88> When device is booted, it must be configured within windows vs. when in fastboot.
04:33:02 <b1101> huh?
04:33:26 <Hodge88> Appreciate the conversation, guys. Again, sorry I'm a noob. If you need an engine rebuilt, or a turbocharger installed, I'm your man!
04:33:30 <b1101> you have to have your phone connected to your pc when it's booted in bootloader/fastboot mode to flash
04:34:00 <b1101> and at that point make sure all the drivers are installed
04:35:38 <Hodge88> My device was unrecognizable via my PC when I first connected - when phone was booted up and running on original system
04:35:41 <Hodge88> I found this: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_phone/pixel-4a-phone-is-not-being-recognized-by-windows/3e6790ba-36d5-4a40-9c98-8b7c1d81f74f
04:36:04 <Hodge88> And I had to go to device manager and "update driver" as MTP device.
04:36:44 <Hodge88> THEN, the PC could recognize device. However, from command prompt within platform tools, "fastboot devices" command would not find device.
04:37:12 <b1101> is your phone currently in bootloader mode?
04:37:17 <Hodge88> re-"updating" drivers from within device manager to moto composite ADB made device respond to the "fastboot devices" command
04:37:50 <Hodge88> I'm looking at the fastboot mode screen, with red bootloader unlocked
04:37:51 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: you need the fastboot driver
04:38:18 <strcat[m]> Windows USB is weird
04:38:30 <strcat[m]> and a lot of vendors uploaded drivers without changing the vendor ids to their own
04:38:39 <strcat[m]> so many use the sample Pixel ids
04:39:02 <strcat[m]> you could also download the driver from Google if you can't figure out how to get the Android fastboot driver from Windows Update / device manager
04:39:55 <Hodge88> k, let me see what I can do. brbn
04:45:12 <strcat> generating deltas for the new release now
04:45:16 <strcat> still testing it internally
04:45:40 <strcat> taking long than usual due to the recent escalation of attacks on the project and developers
04:47:28 <b1101> by cunthead?
04:47:29 <Hodge88> not finding fastboot driver directly from google. got a link?
04:48:52 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb
04:48:58 <strcat[m]> our docs recommend getting it via Windows Update
04:49:00 <strcat[m]> but you can get it from there
04:49:06 <strcat[m]> if for some reason that's not working for you
04:49:24 <b1101> I'm surprised with win10 that it doesn't update it automatically from device manager
04:49:36 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb
04:49:37 <strcat[m]> here
04:49:53 <strcat[m]> that's the generic page
04:50:07 <strcat[m]> b1101: it's supposed to
04:50:17 <strcat[m]> b1101: an issue is that vendors forgot to remove / change the Pixel vendor ids
04:50:24 <strcat[m]> and uploaded their drivers to Windows Update using those
04:50:32 <b1101> aaah
04:50:32 <strcat[m]> and Microsoft apparently doesn't verify
04:50:39 <strcat[m]> that vendors actually own the vendor ids in their driver
04:50:51 <strcat[m]>  * that vendors actually own the vendor ids for their driver
04:51:24 <strcat> going to try to get something done about it
04:51:29 <strcat> have a lot to deal with atm though
04:52:09 <strcat> should expect Pixel 5 / 4a 5G to take quite a while to add due to the ever increasing escalation of attacks on the project taking too much of my time and other people's time away from development
04:52:22 <strcat> I haven't had time to put together a new workstation yet which is important
04:52:38 <strcat> could really use more help
04:54:38 <rny> help with putting a new workstation together?
04:55:59 <strcat> help with the project as a whole
04:56:03 <strcat> could use help with that too though
04:56:27 <strcat> finding a proper set of parts that's actually available for purchase for me
04:56:44 <rny> what are your requirements?
04:56:45 <b1101> strcat: are cunthead developers the main source attacks?
04:57:07 <b1101> errr. owners/proprietors..wtf they want to call themselves
04:57:42 <take_a_deep_brea> b1101: please dont referto them like that
04:58:26 <take_a_deep_brea> this room is a public room
04:58:41 <b1101> ah. sorry. didn't know you don't want that kind of language in here

05:01:56 <strcat[m]> threatening people
05:02:15 <strcat[m]> extensive usage of sockpuppet accounts
05:02:34 <strcat[m]> also sponsored posts / reviews to promote their product in a misleading way and also to get people to attack us
05:02:37 <strcat[m]> they are paying people to do that
05:02:47 <b1101> I know calling them names doesn't change anything, but kind of surprised you're against it in any way
05:02:49 <strcat[m]> they've given free phones and paid people who have blogs, podcasts, etc.

05:04:32 <rny> he knows my address

05:05:22 <strcat[m]> it would be immensely helpful if you all started actively countering their BS across different platforms along with reaching out to people about it
05:05:38 <strcat[m]> because instead of building something valuable, that is what they are doing with their time and money
05:05:58 <strcat[m]> and as I said, act better than they do
05:06:16 <strcat[m]> stick to facts and reason, represent the community well
05:06:22 <strcat[m]> calling them stupid names like they do with us doesn't help
05:06:41 <strcat[m]> they do stuff like raiding our channel to spam it and post gore images
05:06:42 <strcat[m]> don't be like them
05:06:44 <grapheneos_user_> There is a medium article about copperheados that supports it, from I think July 2020
05:06:54 <strcat[m]> grapheneos_user_pi: probably part of their sponsored content
05:06:58 <grapheneos_user_> I replied to it and gave info
05:07:34 <grapheneos_user_> About lawsuit and how copperheados is a scam
05:07:37 <strcat[m]> also best not to publicly link to stuff like that since it promotes it fwiw

05:14:12 <b1101> answered my own question. no they don't. wow.
05:15:10 <grapheneos_user_> louipc: then his post about copperhead was probably an honest mistake, not a bribe to get copperhead higher
05:15:40 <grapheneos_user_> <b1101 "answered my own question. no the"> Which one, copperheados source code?
05:16:31 <b1101> grapheneos_user_: yes, and any way to download it. you have to join their "partner network" is that a fancy word for fuck you pay me

05:19:08 <grapheneos_user_> <louipc "would be interesting to know if "> We should try to contact him directly

05:19:48 <louipc> i had just to say thanks for the review
05:20:10 <louipc> month or 2 ago
05:20:43 <b1101> like that there's only 140 users in /r/copperheados and 7k+ in /r/grapheneos
05:22:02 <grapheneos_user_> <b1101 "like that there's only 140 users"> Thats the legacy subreddit for copperheados, their current one is r/copperhead
05:22:20 <grapheneos_user_> But yeah many people stopped using it after the drama in 2018
05:22:42 <b1101> yup. that's the one with 140 users :)
05:23:21 <b1101> there's a post from 6months ago someone saying the source code is out of date, and where he can find it. post is locked. HAHA
05:24:18 <grapheneos_user_> <b1101 "there's a post from 6months ago "> LMAO
05:24:20 <b1101> the problem is that they can trick the everyday user. any tech literate/privacy minded person will see the scam with a few mins of research
05:24:25 <louipc> /r/copperheados is ran by grapheneos
05:24:37 <b1101> no no. in /r/copperhead
05:24:40 <dev6464> Hi, where can I download older factory images of GrapheneOS? I'm looking for the last Android 10 releases.
05:25:45 <louipc> sorry they are not available
05:26:04 <louipc> they are insecure by now
05:28:18 <dev6464> They're not archived anywhere? My device isn't compatible with GrapheneOS, and I just want to pull some of the APKs out to replace my stock packages because they have way too much telemetry...
05:29:36 <louipc> its possible a 3rd party has archived them. They are not supported or recommended
05:29:37 <grapheneos_user_> <dev6464 "They're not archived anywhere? M"> Maybe on the internet somewhere
05:30:12 <grapheneos_user_> Though I know github logs changes made to software - louipc is it possible to reverse those changes?
05:30:44 <grapheneos_user_> Cloning it and then reversing changes
05:31:04 <louipc> sure but you will have to make your own build
05:31:48 <grapheneos_user_> <louipc "sure but you will have to make y"> Right but its not too hard
05:32:06 <grapheneos_user_> dev6464: you can try this
05:32:06 <louipc> its not really reversing changes.. rather than checking out an old revision/tag/
05:32:13 <dev6464> yeah, I saw that that's an option but it's outside of my abilities I think
05:32:35 <dev6464> has the archive naming stayed the same (e.g. sunfish-factory-<versionTag>.zip ?
05:33:39 <louipc> but really old versions are not supported at all
05:35:29 <louipc> dev6464: you dislike telemetry but still want google services or something?
05:36:55 <dev6464> just trying to remove as much of at as I can from my stock image. My device really isn't supported by any privacy-centered OS out there (Motorola One Fusion)
05:37:04 <dev6464> *of it
05:37:33 <take_a_deep_brea> well that is sad .
05:37:45 <grapheneos_user_> GlassROM might work, or maybe lineage
05:38:06 <grapheneos_user_> Though glassrom hasnt been updated for a while
05:38:18 <grapheneos_user_> And lineage is insexure
05:38:37 <louipc> are you stuck with that device for some reason?
05:38:42 <take_a_deep_brea> GlassROM is highly restrictive , though . and not sure wether it supports Motorola phones
05:38:57 <take_a_deep_brea> highly restrictive in a good sense
05:39:33 <b1101> I mean if all you want is the apk, can't you pull them from lineage, or another aosp based rom?
05:41:46 <b1101> and many applications are on fdroid as well. the bigger problem is disabling/removing all the telemetry data collection that's preinstalled
05:44:32 <dev6464> yeah, I've been pulling APKs from various roms, including lineage, looking for the best ones to use. I mostly just need good Dialer, Messaging, and Keyboard apps. Any recommendations?
05:45:10 <dev6464> Looks like neither GlassROM nor lineage supports my device and I doubt they ever will, it seems to be a really uncommon phone
05:45:41 <somenerd[m]> > GlassROM is highly restrictive , though . and not sure wether it supports Motorola phones
05:45:41 <somenerd[m]> I think that it's OnePlus, not motorola
05:45:59 <somenerd[m]> GlassROM is also more restrictive that GrapheneOS, even in terms of goals
05:46:02 <strcat> grapheneos_user_: be aware that Copperhead keeps a close eye on this channel and regularly uses sockpuppet accounts here too
05:46:24 <strcat> grapheneos_user_: so, not a great place to organize / plan anything for defending us, etc.
05:47:54 <somenerd[m]> I see why we don't use this channel now
06:15:32 <grapheneos_user_> strcat: yea I know, I just thought the stuff I mentioned was small things and not actual planning
06:15:49 <grapheneos_user_> But nonetheless I will be more careful next time
06:16:02 <somenerd[m]> like about Copperhead
06:19:55 <grapheneos_user_> somenerd: yea

06:47:18 <strcat[m]> and future upgrade path
06:48:22 <nonie689[m]> Hello. I want to Update my device. But it does not find updates. On your website are a new one for Pixel 4

06:50:15 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
06:50:27 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel
06:50:36 <strcat[m]> the site shows what's currently in each channel
06:50:50 <strcat[m]> the new release will be pushed out via Beta soon
06:51:16 <strcat[m]> it still has to pass internal testing for the Pixel 3 and the testing of the future upgrade path
06:51:35 <strcat[m]> most testing happens via the Beta channel but stuff is tested before it goes out via that
06:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> Woah, whew! Thank you for the update strcat[m]!
06:51:47 <strcat[m]> technically it's possible to use the "internal" testing channel since there's nothing secret about it
06:51:58 <strcat[m]> but I strongly recommend not figuring out how to do that
06:52:24 <nonie689[m]> It doesnt find the update. Is it because the dns server?
06:52:51 <strcat[m]> nonie689: did you read my response and that section?
06:53:00 <nonie689[m]> Yes
06:53:05 <take_a_deep_brea> nonie689: it will be sometime before the updates for stable channel are available
06:53:26 <nonie689[m]> But i doesnt find this build number in my devicr
06:54:00 <strcat> nonie689[m]: compare your version in About phone with what's currently in the stable channel on the site
06:54:08 <strcat> you're probably already up-to-date for the release channel you're using
06:54:43 <nonie689[m]> Ok
06:54:47 <nonie689[m]> Yes i am
06:55:03 <strcat[m]> the new release will be going out via Beta channel soon, then after say 20 hours the Stable channel
06:55:20 <strcat[m]> and by 'soon' for Beta I mean 40 seconds or so from now
06:55:26 <strcat[m]> once my Pixel 4 XL reboots
06:56:02 <strcat> and released via Beta now
06:57:23 <stencil[m]> 20 hour seems pretty soon for beta --> stable
06:59:44 <b1101> so usually are the beta->stable zip's the exact same file?
06:59:47 <strcat> stencil[m]: we generally do 2 releases per month, 1 at the start of the month with the security update, 1 near the end of the month to push out all our non-security-update related changes
07:00:08 <strcat> b1101: a release like 2021.02.02.09 is a specific thing
07:00:21 <strcat> b1101: first it goes out via internal testing channel, then beta, then stable
07:00:31 <strcat> unless issues are caught and then it's considered a 'preview' release and never goes to stable
07:00:41 <strcat> sometimes they're considered a 'preview' in advance
07:00:43 <b1101> right, but is the actual zip file the same?
07:00:52 <somenerd[m]> is GrapheneOS a security partner with google?
07:00:55 <strcat> b1101: yes it's a specific thing, same files
07:00:57 <somenerd[m]> I've heard that somewhere
07:01:09 <somenerd[m]> but didn't get a chance to check
07:01:26 <strcat> somenerd[m]: we were, we need to deal with setting up the stuff again, never found it incredibly helpful though
07:01:44 <somenerd[m]> I thought that patches came earlier
07:01:45 <strcat> somenerd[m]: because the monthly AOSP releases are not just security updates
07:01:49 <strcat> they're security updates + other fixes
07:01:58 <strcat> somenerd[m]: but you can't release them until the embargo ends and that's when they push to AOSP
07:02:16 <somenerd[m]> huh
07:02:24 <strcat> somenerd[m]: and the security update previews are *only* the security updates
07:02:34 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, wow.
07:02:36 <strcat> AOSP monthly updates are the security updates + other improvements
07:02:45 <strcat> so the security update preview is not really what we end up using and shipping
07:03:06 <strcat> somenerd[m]: they release 2 forms of security updates, A) just security updates, applied on top of the initial major release of the platform like android-11.0.0_r1
07:03:10 <somenerd[m]> thought that it released earlier
07:03:13 <strcat> B) the monthly AOSP releases which have other changes
07:03:17 <somenerd[m]> are there benefits?
07:03:21 <strcat> somenerd[m]: no, you get a *preview* that's under embargo
07:03:24 <strcat> you can't ship any earlier
07:03:29 <strcat> the point is you can build and test early
07:03:30 <somenerd[m]> to being a partner?
07:03:33 <strcat> find problems early
07:03:36 <somenerd[m]> I see
07:03:38 <strcat> somenerd[m]: there are different forms of being a partner
07:03:49 <strcat> the security partner thing is mildly helpful but not as much as you'd think
07:04:00 <strcat> we never really benefited from it in any way
07:04:20 <strcat> somenerd[m]: in theory we could dedicate resources to reviewing the patches and making sure they are correct
07:04:22 <strcat> reporting issues to them
07:04:26 <strcat> never had resources for that
07:04:45 <strcat> somenerd[m]: what would be immensely helpful is having early access to the new major releases
07:04:48 <strcat> that's what we really needed
07:05:22 <strcat> the security updates are pretty trivial - we've never really had a single issue caused by the AOSP monthly updates (security updates + other changes)
07:05:34 <hanetzer> strcat: the best thing for all android projects would be source code to the cell blobs but we all know that's never going to happen :<
07:05:39 <strcat> even the more major migrations to new maintenance release branches aren't a problem
07:05:56 <strcat> the problem we have is needing to do the massive yearly migration to the new major release without early access
07:06:02 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy hanetzer~
07:06:25 <strcat> so ideally we would have early access to Android 12 when other OEMs do, for example
07:06:30 <strcat> and then we could start porting months early
07:06:32 <strcat> and be ready
07:06:38 <hanetzer> TheJollyRoger: ahoy. I'ma be out of talk for a bit. kernel bisect re: amdgpu lockups & a new bios update :)
07:06:47 <strcat> not a massive stressful rush to do an insane amount of work porting over a couple weeks
07:06:49 <strcat> once a year
07:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh >_<... so they get all of that stuff ahead of time and more support.
07:06:51 <strcat> that's awful
07:06:54 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
07:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> hanetzer: oh yikes! Fingers crossed for you, amdgpu always seems to be giving me problems, hope you have better luck than I with it.
07:07:21 <strcat> basically the way we do it is we ship the security update for the month then immediately shift to insane amount of work on porting to the new major release
07:07:24 <strcat> since it's time sensitive
07:07:30 <take_a_deep_brea> strcat:  what does it take to have early access ? are the set criterias or is it arbitrary ?
07:07:33 <strcat> it's an insane amount of work and we really need more help with it
07:07:49 <strcat> take_a_deep_brea: I don't really think it's a thing without being a hardware OEM shipping a device with Play but I'm not sure
07:08:00 <strcat> if we partnered with an OEM that had early access
07:08:06 <strcat> we could probably get the early access through them
07:08:13 <strcat> it would be immensely helpful
07:08:21 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
07:08:23 <strcat> we would need to set up private repos to collaborate on that though
07:15:03 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow. So getting hardware/OEM partnership is more than just a matter of handsets... but also going to be a matter of getting access to the source code and more dev time to make the port each year.
07:15:26 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: well we could have a partnership with an OEM that gives us early access
07:15:28 <strcat[m]> without making hardware with them
07:15:39 <somenerd[m]> also not having the loading a new OS message on screen
07:15:42 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
07:15:53 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: hehe, yeah that would be very nice indeed!
07:16:17 <somenerd[m]> yeah, you can't tell if it's malicious or not
07:16:32 <somenerd[m]> but tbf, unlocking the bootloader factory resets the device
07:22:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy JTL~
07:51:29 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356872788091539457
07:51:35 <strcat[m]> web installer compatibility issue with Pixel 3 and 3 XL was fixed
07:51:53 <strcat[m]> it was scared to flash them due to a safety check that was failing due to a legacy difference
07:52:08 <strcat[m]> working well now, so if anyone was running into that error for the 3 or 3 XL it's resolved and you can go ahead now
07:52:22 <TheJollyRoger> Whew, glad to see!
07:52:42 <strcat[m]> testing on 3a again too to make sure there aren't regressions for others
07:54:52 <strcat[m]> it's just a pain for me to test across all of them because they are all paired with attestation.app
07:55:01 <strcat[m]> so I have to delete the entry and re-pair after
07:55:10 <strcat[m]> and scanning the Wi-FI sharing QR code is getting old
07:57:07 <TheJollyRoger> If I had to retype my wifi password in every time on a tiny phone screen, I'd go nuts.
07:57:32 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you so much for going through the extra mile on this, thank you.
07:59:04 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: I don't type it, I scan the Wi-Fi share QR code
07:59:06 <strcat> from another phone
07:59:14 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: go into Wi-Fi settings, select the Wi-Fi network and click share
07:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Oh cool!
07:59:25 <strcat> it's a QR code you can scan from another phone to give it the network SSID, password, etc.
07:59:43 <strcat> I don't know the Wi-Fi password it's some random string
08:00:08 <strcat> it was a *real* pain before they had the share qr codes
08:00:27 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: the button to scan one is at the bottom of the list of networks
08:00:48 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: so for example if you have a guest network with a password you could have a QR code for ppl to scan
08:00:55 <strcat> printed out
08:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> Oh dang, that's handy.
08:04:03 <TheJollyRoger> Now I just need the pandemic to be over so I can have some guests... T_T
08:09:39 <nullnode[m]> Beta channel update hit, all comfy so far
08:09:58 <take_a_deep_brea> same here .
08:09:59 <TheJollyRoger> nullnode[m]: awesome to hear!
08:10:04 <take_a_deep_brea> smooth as ever
08:10:57 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo, take_a_deep_brea!
08:25:45 <cx7dd[m]> Hello everybody.
08:25:45 <cx7dd[m]> If I reboot my phone and haven't enterd my decryption password and I scroll down the notification bar, I still see my wifis name.
08:25:45 <cx7dd[m]> Does that mean that the Wifi credentials arent encrypted?
08:27:40 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
08:27:42 <strcat[m]> read that
08:27:50 <strcat[m]> all data is encrypted
08:28:31 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi network configuration is stored as device encrypted data, not in the owner profile
08:35:37 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: there is 'device encrypted' data that's a global key and stuff can be explicitly put there, app data and user data is in user profiles each with their own key protected by their lock method
08:35:49 <strcat[m]> and the owner profile also has data inside it such as app usage stats, etc. that's sensitive
08:36:43 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: there's nothing not encrypted but 'device encrypted' data is available before unlocking the owner profile and is enough to run an accessibility service designed to work in that mode, a keyboard designed to work in that, update the OS, etc.
08:36:51 <strcat[m]>  * cx7dd: there's nothing not encrypted but 'device encrypted' data is available before unlocking the owner profile and is enough to run an accessibility service designed to work in that mode, a keyboard designed to work in that mode, update the OS, etc.
08:37:31 <strcat[m]> and global configuration of the OS such as enabling an extra security feature is stored there
08:38:00 <strcat[m]> or as another example, deciding whether passwords are shown while typing
08:40:05 <strcat[m]> the purpose of the design is to offer granular per-profile encryption and to address prior compatibility issues and drawbacks such as accessibility services needing to disable encryption, not having important configuration enabled until initial unlock, not being able to update there, etc.
08:40:41 <strcat[m]> it'd be entirely possible to ask for another password on boot for device encrypted data but the concept of it is that only stuff that's not sensitive should ever be put there
08:40:49 <strcat[m]> Wi-Fi password is always available on the router that's not at rest
08:41:03 <somenerd[m]> > it'd be entirely possible to ask for _another_ password on boot for device encrypted data but the concept of it is that only stuff that's not sensitive should ever be put there
08:41:03 <somenerd[m]> used to be a past feature right?
08:41:08 <strcat[m]> no
08:41:22 <strcat[m]> we never supported it with the granular encryption model
08:41:26 <strcat[m]> filesystem-based encryption
08:41:42 <strcat[m]> so, now each profile has encryption based on their lock method
08:42:00 <strcat[m]> before, there was only a global key (a long time ago, at this point) which after early boot was always in memory
08:42:26 <strcat[m]> and if you enabled an accessibility service it had to disable having an encryption passphrase
08:42:35 <somenerd[m]> what
08:42:41 <somenerd[m]> wow
08:42:50 <somenerd[m]> AOSP used to be a lot lot poorer at security
08:42:50 <strcat[m]> how else would it run before decrypting before there was granular encryption?
08:42:56 <somenerd[m]> (at least afaict)
08:43:07 <strcat[m]> all you could do before decrypting in early boot with the global encryption key was an emergency call
08:43:07 <somenerd[m]> > how else would it run before decrypting before there was granular encryption?
08:43:07 <somenerd[m]> yeah, makes sense why
08:43:16 <strcat[m]> and it wouldn't know about config the user set
08:43:21 <strcat[m]> including config to make the device more secure
08:43:32 <strcat[m]> like LTE only mode
08:43:52 <strcat[m]>  * and it wouldn't know about global OS config the user set
08:44:32 <strcat[m]> so, it makes sense to audit what's made device encrypted and move more stuff to the owner profile system data
08:44:47 <strcat[m]> but in general device encrypted data is important for security
08:45:25 <strcat[m]> unlocking the owner profile is basically the boot password - that makes a lot of system-wide sensitive stuff available
08:45:45 <strcat[m]> what you get before then is stuff deliberately made device encrypted to make it function before that
08:46:18 <strcat[m]> so for example a proper keyboard will have device encryption support where it has a special device encryption mode where it has no access to any user data, etc.
08:46:29 <strcat[m]> since that's stored in the default location (in the user profile)
08:46:42 <strcat[m]> but it can opt in on a case-by-case basis to storing certain preferences, etc. as device encrypted
08:46:54 <strcat[m]> so that the keyboard can be used when you're typing your initial unlock passphrase
08:47:11 <strcat[m]> instead of a hard-wired keyboard that only works for latin languages and is always in english mode on boot  like before
08:47:49 <strcat[m]> so, I hope it makes sense why this is important, and also the advantage of per-profile encryption keys, and the ability to end sessions of secondary profiles
08:48:38 <strcat[m]> all data is encryption, but certain non-sensitive data is explicitly made device encrypted so it can be available in early boot (and apps can explicitly implement this and opt-in case-by-case for their data if they have a use for this)
08:48:56 <strcat[m]>  * all data is encrypted, but certain non-sensitive data is explicitly made device encrypted so it can be available in early boot (and apps can explicitly implement this and opt-in case-by-case for their data if they have a use for this)
08:49:13 <strcat[m]> somenerd: but yeah that was one of the huge drawbacks of accessibility services before
08:49:39 <somenerd[m]> it still presents a huge attack surface sadly
08:49:42 <strcat[m]> somenerd: people with disabilities requiring a third party accessibility service didn't get to have credential-based encryption
08:49:50 <somenerd[m]> yeah
08:49:52 <strcat[m]> somenerd: I mean, define huge
08:50:00 <strcat[m]> the point of it is you don't put sensitive data there - and it's still encrypted
08:50:09 <somenerd[m]> I meant nowadays
08:50:12 <somenerd[m]> not before
08:50:49 <strcat[m]> if someone is taking apart the device and heavily tampering it to bypass stuff then there are bigger issues than them being able to try exploiting the OS via tampering with the encrypted fs format
08:51:15 <strcat[m]> all the blocks of data are still encrypted
08:52:11 <strcat[m]> there are some things about it we want to improve
08:52:43 <strcat[m]> the general concept of having fine-grained keys and ability to purge them without reboot is really important
08:54:33 <strcat> matrix is lagging
08:55:21 <strcat[m]> there is room for improvement in terms of moving some things from device encrypted to the owner profile protected system storage
08:55:22 <strcat[m]> and it's important to have the ability to explicitly mark data as available pre-first-unlock so that everyone can have credential-based encryption and so features like LTE-only mode and any other important OS config can be available
08:55:57 <strcat> reordered those messages
08:56:48 <somenerd[m]> yeah it's laggy
08:57:29 <strcat> also if you wonder why you MUST unlock the owner profile before any other user profiles
08:57:31 <strcat> that's why
08:57:40 <strcat> and that's why only secondary profiles have 'end session' atm
08:58:09 <strcat> in the owner profile can have it but it would basically just be rebooting, skipping going through the firmware stuff and loading kernel
08:58:16 <strcat> in theory*
08:58:43 <aussiekez[m]> ok
09:00:06 <strcat> the fs encryption will become authenticated encryption instead of XTS eventually to improve anti-tampering
09:01:24 <TheJollyRoger> That's music to my ears.
09:01:25 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
09:01:35 <take_a_deep_brea> <TheJollyRoger "That's music to my ears."> yep
09:40:17 <hobo8818[m]> Does the seedvault app also backup actual files like photos
09:54:31 <deappledapple> No
10:46:18 <AppAraat[m]> <hobo8818[m] "Does the seedvault app also back"> Only things like apps and their config (if the apps allow for that)
10:50:06 <oldman_newuser> yea seedvault does apps and configs but like you say only certain apps allow config.  and you cant restore from a nextcloud backup.  I copied my nextcloud backup to a thumb drive.  prolly 2 out of 3 apps could would backup the config.
10:51:04 <oldman_newuser> the ones that that wouldnt allow the config backed up I would clear the cache/data or reinstall.  some acted funky with permissions and such if I didnt

15:21:45 <AppAraat[m]> Can anyone explain to me what is going on lol
15:21:53 <AppAraat[m]> (or at least help me with deleting all of my contacts)
15:32:16 <nscnt[m]> AppAraat: I was able to delete contacts by clearing the storage of "Contacts Storage". You can search it in the Settings.
15:33:06 <AppAraat[m]> welp. just deleted all of my contacts manually, but I'll try to remember this from now on :p
15:33:29 <nscnt[m]> ^^
15:35:57 <AppAraat[m]> nscnt: btw, clearing "Contacts Storage" also deleted my call log. Definitely not expected that lol

16:33:42 <AppAraat[m]> Q: Anyone else having permission issues with Ghost Commander (installed via FDroid) ?
16:33:43 <AppAraat[m]> As in: It can only view media files, and it can't write anything to the FS.
16:35:00 <mynacol[m]> AppAraat: IIRC the app is quite old and does not implement new permission dialogs in Android 11
16:35:42 <mynacol[m]> Maybe you can maually get the app full storage access. But in the sense of security, you should move to another file manager
16:36:50 <AppAraat[m]> My P2 is also Android 11 but it works there just fine. Though if you've got a better recommendation for a different FM then I'm all ears.
16:39:11 <mynacol[m]> Depends on what you expect the FM to do
16:40:07 <mynacol[m]> There is an integrated app, which may or may not suffice
16:40:35 <AppAraat[m]> I guess... something similar to the Ghost Commander. Preferably dual pane and aimed for power users.
16:47:12 <mynacol[m]> I just checked. The app targets api 29 (= Android 10), so not really old.

18:17:17 <TheJollyRoger> openupm8[m]: UFED extractors aren't what you think they often market themselves as. What they simply are, are a guided way to extract data for which the password has been obtained; just because a device is supported by them, it doesn't actually mean much more than if the device is supported by ADB. For device *unlockers* what they are, are a guided, prepackaged way to use canned exploits on
18:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> devices that have not been updated or kept up to date, or are no longer maintained and have become obsolete. In those cases, they rely on an exploit. Of course, the companies selling UFED devices like to deliberately muddy the waters to greatly overstate their capabilities, and journalists really like to jump on that because this sells stories with clickbait titles.
18:18:44 <TheJollyRoger> openupm8[m]: For instance, Cellebrite said it could extract Signal messages. What it kind of didn't stress was that it could do so while the device was unlocked and the screen was on, but that was sensational enough of a headline for people to start running around screaming "The sky is falling! The sky is falling!"
18:21:41 <artty> Hello community. I am trying to install grapheneos on my unlocked pixel 4a but am getting stuck after entering: fastboot flashing unlock. All I get back is "waiting for any device"  I've installed drivers, enable USB debugging and file transfer, but nothing is working. All software on android and windows 10 is updated. Any suggestions?
18:23:36 <entry1[m]> <artty "Hello community. I am trying to "> Have you tried a different USB cable or port? That is usually the issue if it says waiting for device
18:24:16 <entry1[m]> That is good you installed all updates/optional updates for Win10, as well as did all the android updates before flashing
18:25:17 <artty> No I haven't tried a different cable or port. The computer actually reads the phone alright when not in boot mode
18:27:25 <entry1[m]> Yep, you can still encounter that with a faulty cable or port. I've had the exact thing happen to me
18:28:09 <artty> Oh interesting. Alright, that gives me something to try. Thank you
18:30:57 <entry1[m]> Do you have a USB C port on your computer, or just the standard USB A port? If you happen to have a USB C port, the original cable that came with the Pixel should work well. If not, it can be a little hit or miss with the USB A to USB C cables with the quality.
18:31:38 <entry1[m]> But definitely try different ports before buying another cable
18:34:16 <artty> Yes I have a USB C and brand new cable that came with the pixel. I just tried a USB C to USB A and still getting the same message.
18:34:31 <artty> Doesn't seem like a cable or port issue

18:36:28 <take_a_deep_brea> <illustratorius[m "How do we know if an app has in-"> at the end of the day it all boils down to wether you trust the app with your data or not. how far do the app documentation explain its privacy policy , how far is the policy actually enforced and how far is this process transparent to the end user. its not necessary for an app to use third party tracking libraries to exfiltrate your data or violate your
18:36:28 <take_a_deep_brea> privacy in some such way. they can do so through legitimate connections made with first party servers too. even denying network permissions has its limitations . so in the end the best policy is to only use apps one trusts .

18:40:35 <Hodge88> Because the official instructions for graphene cover the pixel 4a, and because they reference the latest firmware, I simply copied/pasted all the official commands directly from the website into powershell terminal
18:40:57 <oooohshini[m]> <DixieDean[m] "Hotspot works fine for me in a 3"> Do you feel the hotspot is secure compared to open WiFi? Does it use WPA3 for authentication for example?
18:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> artty: If you're getting the problem where the phone seems to strangely work normally, and fastboot enumerates the device correctly on `fastboot devices` but then ./flash-all.bat locks up, it's likely that your motherboard vendor doesn't adequately implement all the features of USB3.1 properly on that port, or it's a cable issue. If you're not getting proper output from `fastboot devices` then
18:42:28 <TheJollyRoger> that may indicate that the optional driver is not installed, you'll need to get it via Windows update.
18:43:21 <TheJollyRoger> artty, a ton of motherboard vendors simply implement the bare minimum of features that USB supports and that most people will use day to day, and don't bother implementing everything, or implementing it properly. This usually leads to the first case.
18:45:25 <artty> TheJollyRoger: it doesn't recognize my phone when i run fastboot devices
18:45:50 <TheLoneWanderer[> Win10?
18:45:57 <artty> i've updated the drivers as suggested. Yes, Win 10
18:46:51 <Hodge88> artty, under device manager, how does Win10 recognize your device?
18:46:56 <TheLoneWanderer[> Not much I can say if you've installed the optional update
18:48:21 <artty> well id doesn't recognize it when it's in bootloader, only when it normally turned on and it's recognized then as a pixel 4a. But after one of the driver updates it recognized it as something else, can't remember exactly MTB device or something
18:49:35 <Hodge88> I'm by no means a techie that's qualified to offer technical support; indeed I am here because I'm having trouble as well - but I tore my hair out for a while getting the driver arranged for pixel 4a. My device was unrecognizable (other than simply by name "pixel 4a") by Win10 until I tired multiple options.
18:49:51 <TheLoneWanderer[> Did you download the driver while the device was in fastboot mode?
18:50:22 <artty> i just turned it on and now it's listed as pixel 4a under universal serial bus devices
18:50:48 <artty> no, it was in normal mode when i installed the driver
18:51:26 <TheLoneWanderer[> Check windows update while your device is in fastboot mode
18:51:39 <artty> ok
18:51:48 <Hodge88> Currently my device is softbricked because of a failed flash. That said, I can communicate via fastboot with it. Win10 recognizes it as "Android Device", and the driver is is using is:android bootloader interface
18:51:53 <TheLoneWanderer[> Specifically optional updates
18:52:13 <Hodge88> Perhaps that's wrong, but it seems to communicate??
18:53:36 <TheLoneWanderer[> Hodge88 perhaps try the web install?
18:54:19 <Hodge88> TheLoneWanderer: I didn't do optional update because I read a lot of complaints that it screws up lots of drivers...
18:55:28 <Hodge88> My device is currently in fastboot mode, Win10 recognizes it as "Android Device" and is using "Android bootloader interface" driver.
18:55:31 <TheLoneWanderer[> The "update optional driver" was for artty

19:11:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hodge88: something to note:
19:11:22 <TheJollyRoger> USB is actually very complex: just because a cable shows one set of features work, it doesn't mean they all will.
19:11:37 <TheJollyRoger> for instance, the cables that come with your Pixels? They actually aren't fully traced.
19:11:44 <Great_Mitakes> @Hodge88 Keep your cable's connectors straight. I've used cables with cloth too and have noticed no difference in how long they last.
19:11:45 <TheJollyRoger> They're usable for installing the OS, sure.
19:11:47 <TheJollyRoger> But they're incomplete.
19:12:39 <TheLoneWanderer[> I'll be going now. Good luck!
19:12:39 <TheJollyRoger> TheLoneWanderer[ hit the nail on the head, there are many features of USB that most vendors - both in cables, and in motherboards and ports, and firmware - simply don't implement because they don't expect most users will use them.
19:12:46 <TheJollyRoger> Cheers TheLoneWanderer[
19:13:45 <TheLoneWanderer[> Cheers!
19:15:08 <TheJollyRoger> Hodge88: I've had good luck with Aukey and Anker cables so far, but that's just been my own experience.
19:16:10 <Great_Mitakes> @Hodge88 I've found that often the best method of maintaining your cables is to hang them so that the cable remains straight going into the connector. I hang my phones on their charger. I hang my laptop power cord. And they last years. It's all about keeping stress off the connector-cable , and the very Bay way to do that is to keep them straight.
19:16:38 <a24678247> Is there any significance with GrapheneOS in particular in receiving blank text messages?
19:16:54 <a24678247> I'm aware that there existed (and may still exist) "silent" messages used to ping the phone. I'm curious if these are related
19:17:16 <TheJollyRoger> a24678247: this topic has been answered in the FAQ.
19:17:56 <TheJollyRoger> a24678247: https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
19:24:01 <Great_Mitakes> How do I enable pinging? I noticed that any device can get a response by pinging my device, but my device cannot seem to get a response when I tell it to ping anything. I'm assuming the problem is that GrapheneOS is preventing the ping request from going out because f
19:25:52 <Great_Mitakes> because regular android seems to have no issue pinging other devices, including the one with GrapheneOS
19:32:11 <Great_Mitakes> Well, what up my peeps? Nobody knows? Good ole Jolly Roger who is always good for a q&a? Nobody?
19:34:11 <Great_Mitakes> This is not about tuition
19:38:26 <Great_Mitakes> This is not about rooting like last time ... which apparently is frowned upon for done reason ... I'm trying to make a wireless connection to my server that doesn't have a wireless NIC. So I'm trying to troubleshoot this, but I can't ping things with the GrapheneOS device, and that device is what I'm using to facilitate the connection.
19:40:03 <Great_Mitakes> *for some reason
19:42:28 <TheJollyRoger> Great_Mitakes: I can ping my GrapheneOS phone (connected via wifi) from my laptop connected to the router by ethernet.
19:43:17 <TheJollyRoger> Great_Mitakes: rooting is discouraged because it countermands an assumption fundamental to the android security model in that nothing, except maybe perhaps vold, kernel, and possibly init, has root-equivalent access.
19:44:17 <tidria[m]> I just tested pinging my router and it worked fine, might be your network configuration
19:49:17 <Great_Mitakes> I'm trying to ping devices connected through hotspot.
19:49:49 <DixieDean[m]> <Great_Mitakes "I'm trying to ping devices conne"> its usually on a different ip range right
19:49:55 <DixieDean[m]> like 192.168.46.x or something
19:50:53 <Great_Mitakes> I check the IP by using ip addr on Linux and termux respectively.
19:51:55 <petermeter1988[m> Does anyone know, if the Pixel 4a 5G will be supported in the near future?
19:51:59 <DixieDean[m]> is termux not running in a chroot with a tun0?  or virtual adapter?
19:52:02 <DixieDean[m]> never tried it
19:55:48 <Great_Mitakes> DixieDean[m] I'm not sure, but I you can't do things that require root permissions. You might be able too is your phone is rooted. I don't know to though. But it provides command line Linux convenience for many linux things that don't require root permissions.
19:56:53 <Great_Mitakes> let me correct my horrific typos
19:59:31 <Great_Mitakes> DixieDean[m] I'm not sure, but I know you can't do things that require root permissions. You might be able too if your phone is rooted. I don't know though. But it provides command line Linux convenience for many linux things that don't require root permissions.
20:00:49 <DixieDean[m]> Rooting your phone, and then wanting extra security are oxymorons
20:00:56 <DixieDean[m]> you just massively increased the attack surface
20:01:07 <DixieDean[m]> and priv esc is now simple as calling the su binary
20:01:16 <DixieDean[m]> you shouldn't root it if you don't understand that
20:01:30 <Great_Mitakes> And they have their own repositories to install and update their packages with.
20:01:57 <DixieDean[m]> i used to run NetHunter on an Nexus but i wouldn't use it as an EDC
20:02:23 <DixieDean[m]> i think i've seen daniel discuss this many times on twitter
20:02:30 <DixieDean[m]> why there is no root
20:03:59 <illustratorius[m> Any information about the availability of the latest update 2.02.09? I'm pretty new to Graphene. Will the update be OTA or is it a wired update?
20:04:19 <Great_Mitakes> I was saying that you can use non-root Linux commands with termux. I have not rooted my phone, so Id dont know how that works with termux.
20:05:16 <DixieDean[m]> <illustratorius[m "Any information about the availa"> all updates are OTA
20:06:00 <blk> Great_Mitakes: what happens when you try to ping said device?
20:06:45 <illustratorius[m> <DixieDean[m] "all updates are OTA "> Cool. What is the usual time frame between the release notes on the Graphene website and the OTA uodate.?
20:06:56 <illustratorius[m> * Cool. What is the usual time frame between the release notes on the Graphene website and the OTA update.?

20:28:47 <Great_Mitakes> Does anyone want to know what my problem was?
20:29:01 <blk> firewall? wrong IP?
20:29:04 <blk> something dumb?
20:29:05 <illustratorius[m> <strcat[m] "illustratorius: you can turn on "> Good to know. Thank you
20:30:03 <Great_Mitakes> blk YEP, my freaking VPN settings
20:30:40 <blk> Ah, yes
20:30:54 <blk> need a proper split tunneling configuration if you are going to do that
20:30:57 <Great_Mitakes> Of course I had no set it to no traffic except through VPN
20:33:11 <Great_Mitakes> Something I learned though is that hotspot traffic bypasses the VPN. Even when set to no traffic except through VPN. That was probably why they got ping responses.
20:34:06 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: it's a separate thing
20:35:44 <Great_Mitakes> strcat[m] Is it normal for Android to allow hotspot traffic to bypass VPN settings? Is
20:37:15 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: it's not bypassing anything
20:37:17 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: it's separate
20:37:35 <strcat[m]> VPN routes all the traffic from the device (other than the low-level bits needed to connect) through the VPN
20:38:05 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to override the settings elsewhere, you can use a different VPN on your other devices
20:38:13 <strcat[m]> so they're separate
20:39:03 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: this is how it's supposed to work and there's hardware offload for it
20:39:34 <strcat[m]> we have an open issue about providing the option to route that traffic through the same VPN but it wouldn't be the default
20:39:35 <Great_Mitakes> strcat[m] So it creates a parallel network on the same NIC?
20:39:48 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: essentially
20:40:03 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: the phone acts as a router, and it's separate from what the phone is using for the internal traffic
20:40:09 <strcat[m]> and there's hardware offload for acting as a router
20:40:40 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to not use the hardware offload and instead route the traffic via a VPN
20:40:47 <strcat[m]> but you can use a VPN on the other devices already
20:41:17 <Zerock> Anyone in here do cryptocurrency things on grapheneos? I'd like to install a litecoin wallet, but the official one appears to have issues getting the current exchange rate and (more importantly) calculating a good transaction fee. I can't really find anything that seems suitable in F-Droid.
20:41:41 <Great_Mitakes> strcat[m] Is there an app for controlling that?
20:42:12 <strcat[m]> Great_Mitakes: no just saying that it would be possible to implement a toggle changing how it works but it'd make it use a lot more battery life, etc.
20:42:50 <strcat[m]> Zerock: Trezor Suite works well for me in Vanadium, can self-host too ofc then you need a Trezor
20:42:59 <strcat[m]> Zerock: and supports LTC although I haven't used that
20:44:28 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> <Zerock "Anyone in here do cryptocurrency"> monerujo is on fdroid. cake wallet has an apk, monero and bitcoin support and will be on fdroid soon
20:45:00 <Zerock> I wasn't able to find monerujo on fdroid, only a fork for a different coin
20:45:26 <Great_Mitakes> Well, I hope GrapheneOS developers create that setting to divert hotspot (and tether traffic if it it doesn't do it already) traffic through the VPN.
20:45:34 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> <Zerock "I wasn't able to find monerujo o"> https://f-droid.monerujo.io/
20:45:45 <Zerock> ahh, they have their own repo, thanks
20:46:40 <Hodge88> Turns out my USB A-->C cable was indeed intermittent, and the issue causing my GrapheneOS flash failures! Thanks for the help, everyone!
20:46:44 <u29601mg6ba93j[m> No problem. I like people using these wallets and hopefully making donations in xmr or btc to the grapheneos devs
20:47:58 <Great_Mitakes> Hodge88 Hang your cables to ensure they stay straight going into the connector. They will last a long time doing that.
20:50:58 <Great_Mitakes> I like Jess| better.
20:54:22 <Great_Mitakes> Thanks everyone for helping me out. Thanks @Jol
20:56:12 <Great_Mitakes> Thanks Jolly Roger for helping every time. Thanks strcat for explaining to me about the hotspot vpn functionally of Android.
20:56:19 <t0mo[m]> Are there any plans on improving or extending the default applications shipped with gos, such as the gallery app? If so, I would like to contribute
20:56:39 <strcat[m]> t0mo: not really in that case
20:56:46 <Great_Mitakes> Hasta Luego
20:56:53 <strcat[m]> it's just a placeholder
20:57:01 <strcat[m]> there has to be a built-in gallery app
20:57:12 <strcat[m]> it would make more sense to start over
20:59:45 <t0mo[m]> If starting over using kotlin instead of java would probably make sense, right?
20:59:53 <strcat[m]> yes
21:01:31 <t0mo[m]> I'm a java dev and learning kotlin at the moment. So I could help in the near feature to rewrite some of the system apps

21:18:30 <pnrxa[m]1> The calendar app is interestingly useless but i found the GitHub issue on it
21:19:12 <strcat[m]> pnrxa: it works for showing events from a backend
21:19:14 <strcat[m]> that's the purpose of it
21:19:21 <strcat[m]> you'd have to install a calendar backend though
21:21:12 <pnrxa[m]1> Ah okay, it can't notify though right?
21:23:03 <strcat[m]> don't think it can do that it's just for testing a backend
21:26:47 <blk> strcat[m]: isn't there a native calendar backend?
21:27:35 <blk> I also glossed over the bundled calendar app because it didn't seem to work with DAVx5, but admit I didn't poke around much.
21:27:38 <pnrxa[m]1> Does disabling the calendar app break anything?
21:29:58 <b1101> pnrxa[m]: nope
21:30:25 <pnrxa[m]1> b1101: awesome
21:30:27 <b1101> I actually have it disabled, as it's a very featureless calendar app
21:30:54 <whhoops[m]> Is updating the same process as using stock Android or how would I go about it?
21:31:47 <strcat[m]> pnrxa: it will break something that expects to be able to view calendar events and assumes it can try doing it

21:32:04 <strcat[m]> whhoops: https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
21:32:09 <strcat[m]> read both of those sections
21:32:09 <b1101> simple calendar pro is my choice for calendar
21:32:26 <strcat[m]> probably the 2nd one (about the releases) first since you're probably confused about the usage of release channels
21:32:44 <TheJollyRoger> t0mo[m]: Hot damn, awesome to hear! Welcome aboard, we certainly need and would welcome any help!

21:34:29 <pnrxa[m]1> b1101: yea I use this too and add my nextcloud and activesync clanendars to it
21:36:19 <strcat[m]> pnrxa: if you install a replacement that provides all the APIs other apps expect then disabling it is fine
21:36:21 <strcat[m]> like Etar

22:00:33 <therealbadassmof> Hi all,
22:00:33 <therealbadassmof> Is there any way to route the hotspot/USB tether traffic via phone's VPN on GrapheneOS? When using phone's hotspot to browse internet via laptop, that traffic does not go through phone's VPN which then get's picked up by cell carrier as a hotspot traffic and gets throttled. There was an app on Fdroid called VPN hotspot which modified iptables and ip rules to route tethered traffic via phone's VPN thus hiding
22:00:33 <therealbadassmof> tether activity from cell carrier but unfortunately it required root access. Are there any workarounds for this? or is this something which will be implemented in the future?
22:03:15 <strcat[m]> therealbadassmofo: this was just asked by someone a while ago - is this the same person?
22:04:14 <therealbadassmof> no, not the same person.
22:04:19 <strcat[m]> strange
22:04:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> therealbadassmofo: it is recommended that you run a vpn on the pc itself
22:04:56 <strcat[m]> therealbadassmofo: there's an enhancement filed in the tracker about providing the option to toggle on routing tethered traffic via the phone's VPN
22:05:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> That takes care of most carriers filtering tethering
22:05:03 <strcat[m]> therealbadassmofo: you or anyone else is welcome to work on it
22:05:35 <strcat[m]> therealbadassmofo: try to set your TTL 1 higher on the computer and run a VPN there
22:05:52 <strcat[m]> net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl = 65 instead of 64
22:07:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are other ways I do not recommend but
22:07:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pdanet can use adb to give an internet connection
22:07:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since it doesn't use the inbuilt vpn functionality it always goes through the vpn
22:07:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> As it is just an app
22:07:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> However be warned that adb is a security risk
22:08:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> And we don't really support users playing with developer options
22:21:59 <Hodge88> Does grapheneOS keyboard have a function for "swype" style word entry? I can't find it, if it does.
22:22:17 <Hodge88> If not, is there a keyboard with this feature y'all can recommend?
22:22:25 <strcat[m]> it doesn't
22:24:37 <pnrxa[m]1> Hodge88: don't know the name off the top of my head but there's at least one open source keyboard with swype
22:25:39 <Hodge88> To help my DDG searching, is "swype" the correct search term/keyword to use?
22:26:08 <Hodge88> 'preciate the responses, guys and gals
22:30:02 <pnrxa[m]1> Hodge88: anysoftkeyboard has 'gesture typing' which I guess might be the same thing
22:30:59 <lucaszanella[m]> Did anyone here build android emulator before? I've been adding missing repos to grapheneos's default.xml but it looks like a non ending task, there's always a missing one. Would be nice if someone could tell me which repos are needed
22:34:08 <Hodge88> pnrxa[m]1 Thanks, I'll check it out!
22:46:14 <thetranstocommie> hey so I hate to be that person who joins just to basically ask like 1 or 2 questions, but is there any way to tell which apps require microg? I want to switch from calyxos to grapheneos, but I can't do that if it breaks video calling in my doctors office's app
22:47:24 <thetranstocommie> <Hodge88 "If not, is there a keyboard with"> anysoftkeyboard has swipe typing. its definitely not my favorite keyboard in the world, but its Foss and it works.
22:48:11 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: disable it there
22:48:16 <strcat[m]> and see if it still works
22:51:04 <Hodge88> Is uptodown.com a safe place to download APKs to use on graphene? From a security/privacy point of view, I mean...
22:51:29 <thetranstocommie> it registers for cloud messaging, and I wont really be able to see if it works unless I get an appointment that way. didn't know if there was a simpler solution. if not, I'll just back this installation up and give graphene a go. thanks!
22:54:34 <pnrxa[m]1> Hodge88: fdroid, project's github and aurora store if you must
22:54:40 <strcat[m]> Hodge88: use Aurora Store for apps from the Play Store
22:55:01 <thetranstocommie> +1 to all the above.
22:55:37 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: it's pretty likely they use FCM for push notifications but it may work without it - perhaps without push notifications
22:57:53 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: Good luck, and welcome aboard the ship!
22:58:49 <Hodge88> I'm not much of a techie, in fact had a hard time installing graphene on my device. That said, how can I help with development?
22:59:33 <pnrxa[m]1> Check out the GitHub and look for open issues
22:59:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hey Hodge88, there are a few ways to help with development, let me pull up a few of my notes...
23:01:28 <TheJollyRoger> The lowest barrier to entry, is if you have a good backup system in place (an ordinary USB drive will do the trick, and GrapheneOS already has the necessary backup system in place), to run the Beta release, and as soon as the beta releases go out, upgrade to them as quickly as possible and report any issues you have before the beta goes to stable.
23:02:02 <TheJollyRoger> Usually the beta aims to be pushed to stable within a matter of hours of its release, which can come sporadically so this requires being very "on the ball."
23:02:43 <thetranstocommie> can betas be installed OTA? I'd love to help but my access to computers is really limited
23:02:52 <thetranstocommie> * can beta updates be installed OTA? I'd love to help but my access to computers is really limited
23:03:13 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: Yes, you can - what you need to do is before the beta is pushed, switch to the Beta Channel.
23:03:45 <strcat[m]> you can switch to the Beta channel at any time
23:03:55 <strcat[m]> go into the update settings and switch
23:04:03 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
23:04:11 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
23:04:26 <TheJollyRoger> So the idea being: as soon as a beta update is coming, get prepared, then jump on it as quickly as you can. Upgrade to the beta channel, and then as soon as it's up, immediately try to do as much as you can with your phone, write down any issues you see or don't see, and then report back.
23:04:31 <strcat[m]> the configured update channels is the channel it checks for updates from
23:04:42 <thetranstocommie> awesome! I'll switch to graphene later today. I can't code, but I'm always up for helping open source projects.
23:04:45 <strcat[m]>  * the configured update channel is the channel it checks for updates from
23:05:11 <TheJollyRoger> "Upgraded to the beta, used my Pixel 4a to call, run apps X, Y, and Z, browse with Vanadium, no issues!" is usually good enough if you don't find any problems.
23:06:00 <thetranstocommie> so bug reports, just bring them up here, or fill something out more officially on the github?
23:06:03 <TheJollyRoger> This does require you be alert and attentive, beta testers need to be ready to go as soon as the update is pushed onto the server and released, since when the beta release is out, the stable release follows it quickly.
23:06:44 <TheJollyRoger> Usually bringing them up here tends to work well - they don't have to be long, just the idea is, the developers need to be able to know that the beta release didn't break anything, before it gets marked as "Stable" and goes out to everyone else.
23:07:11 <thetranstocommie> any way to get notified when a beta goes live?
23:07:17 <TheJollyRoger> So ideally, once you get that update, use your phone as much as you can within that short window: run and use apps, make calls, recieve calls, switch your phone on and off, etc.
23:07:32 <TheJollyRoger> Your phone dials out to the update server for an update roughly every four hours.
23:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> So it will check for you, provided your notifications are switched on.
23:08:13 <Volkoz[m]> just got my pixel 4a, but my computer's broke lol. hopefully i can obtain one later
23:08:15 <TheJollyRoger> (It will still check even if your notifications are set to "do not disturb" but you won't see the dot)
23:08:58 <TheJollyRoger> If you have "Do Not Disturb" on, then the "Downloading latest release/reboot to run latest release" dot is hidden from view and you won't see it.
23:09:54 <TheJollyRoger> So the idea being, run the beta updates, and as soon as you can, test them out, then immediately tell the developers "She works, nothing broken" if it's good, or if something *did* break, then converse with them.
23:10:21 <thetranstocommie> honestly like 95% of the reason I wanna switch from calyx is it just kinda feels like its funneling me towards their other services and I'd rather be using something more community driven. I'd be thrilled to contribute.
23:10:23 <TheJollyRoger> Usually nothing does end up breaking. Time is often of the essence, though.
23:10:32 <TheJollyRoger> thetranstocommie: Woohoo! You rock!
23:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> So that's the easiest and fastest way to be helping out, without programming experience - I'll move onto the next.
23:11:21 <TheJollyRoger> The next way, is to run the Compatibility Test Suite. This though, is a fairly big commitment.
23:11:39 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: https://grapheneos.org/features has a nice list of advantages over AOSP and other non-hardened AOSP derivatives
23:11:39 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need a computer, a good USB cable, and likely a spare phone dedicated specifically for it.
23:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> You'll also need an lamp you can leave on 24 hours a day, and a space you can set up where the phone won't be disturbed, and then you'd be running a series of tests.
23:12:42 <TheJollyRoger> then you'll be getting the results and compiling them into a report form. I have some information on doing that.
23:12:49 <strcat[m]> for any service we provide, we make sure there's documentation on self-hosting it
23:13:22 <strcat[m]> update server, attestation server, time server, connectivity check server all have their configs, etc. on GitHub
23:13:35 <strcat[m]> so will the app repo when we make the planned app for that
23:14:01 <TheJollyRoger> The long story short is that the computer will be running a series of stress tests on the phone, and logging what it gets: you will need a spare device to do it with, because you'll be resetting this phone often.

23:15:09 <TheJollyRoger> Other ways to help out on the development side is to check out the issue tracker. GrapheneOS has a big issue tracker which helps keep track of goals, milestones, bugs...
23:15:17 <TheJollyRoger> Planned features, that sort of thing.
23:15:35 <strcat[m]> going to publish more of the mail server configuration too but it needs to be split up more
23:15:45 <thetranstocommie> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/build#upd"> the closest thing I do to anything sysadmin related like that is run pihole lmao
23:15:48 <TheJollyRoger> Many of them range from low hanging fruit, such as asking for a pin-code on unlock, to stuff that might require more specialized knowledge, such as memory tagging in the hardened allocator.
23:16:08 <TheJollyRoger> A lot of the ecosystem will be Java and Kotlin.
23:16:50 <TheJollyRoger> There are other ways to help with the promotion of GrapheneOS, but right now I need to scoot and be away from my desk... I'll return in a bit.
23:17:51 <thetranstocommie> for sure. I'm sure I'll be back asking more questions once I get it set up.
23:22:46 <majorasparagus0[> Hi friends. Is there any way that graphene users have found to run multiple cell numbers on a single device?
23:23:15 <strcat[m]> will be possible when we have eSIM support
23:23:23 <majorasparagus0[> MySudo is now the one tool that is stopping complete transition to graphene
23:23:32 <strcat[m]> majorasparagus0: if you mean virtual numbers
23:23:37 <majorasparagus0[> <strcat[m] "will be possible when we have eS"> Thanks
23:23:38 <strcat[m]> then there are alternatives to that which work without Google services
23:23:48 <strcat[m]> I thought you meant an actual mobile network connection
23:23:53 <strcat[m]> not just a virtual phone number
23:24:17 <strcat[m]> my eSIM response was about it becoming possible to have a mobile network with physical SIM and another with eSIM at the same time
23:24:40 <majorasparagus0[> I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the difference
23:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> Just jumped back for a moment... majorasparagus0[: you can get VOIP numbers, actually. If you have the time to set them up you can allot multiple phone numbers onto GrapheneOS using a software phone.
23:25:44 <majorasparagus0[> I use mysudo on the KYC phone. I think those are 'virtual' numbers (eSim), right?
23:27:17 <strcat[m]> majorasparagus0: no
23:27:21 <strcat[m]> eSIM is not a "virtual number"
23:27:27 <majorasparagus0[> <TheJollyRoger "Just jumped back for a moment..."> Thanks. I'll investigate this. Any references you can share would be much appreciated.
23:27:29 <strcat[m]> eSIM is a SIM to let you connect to a mobile network
23:27:38 <strcat[m]> I didn't realize you just wanted a virtual number in my initial response
23:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> majorasparagus0[: One place you can get numbers at, is https://voip.ms, and use a software client like LinPhone, although LinPhone is a very old app and it's not the easiest to set up.
23:28:34 <majorasparagus0[> Ah. Yeah, I think that'll suffice. Maybe I am over thinking this, but I like to have compartmentalized numbers
23:29:16 <TheJollyRoger> However, it *does* work on GrapheneOS, and it will allow you to make voice calls to land lines over the internet.
23:29:41 <majorasparagus0[> Very good. Thanks @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org
23:30:04 <TheJollyRoger> Standard disclaimers do apply: if privacy or security is required for any of your phone calls, use an encrypted messaging client, calls to the public telephone network are insecure, yadda yadda.
23:30:36 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck majorasparagus0[
23:30:41 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, gotta run!
