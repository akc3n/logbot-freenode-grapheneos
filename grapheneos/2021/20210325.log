00:01:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> If any change is detected the device will reboot and immediately warn you something is corrupted
00:03:33 <Pete> that is amazing why is graphene not the most used os out there i have had no issues with using it and can do everything i did on my iphone
00:04:13 <generalgorl> hey everyone, my phone originally had a red screen saying it did not pass the audit, now after a factory reset and fixing the clock it has a yellow screen saying it performed a basic initial verification and pairing. Any way to get the green screen and a strong paired verification from here?
00:05:02 <generalgorl> also, agree with ya pete
00:06:13 <Pete> generalgorl From what i know the yellow screen means that the device performing the audit (auditor) is new to the graphene os device, the next time it will be green. If its red than it didnt pass the audit
00:06:55 <generalgorl> so doing a second audit on the same device will make it green?
00:07:04 <Pete> yes i had the same issue
00:07:30 <generalgorl> sounds good thank you very much!

00:53:17 <timetravelingman> There is a panic wipe function
00:53:27 <timetravelingman> It is using a separate profile as your main one
00:53:52 <timetravelingman> Then you can with like two taps delete the entire profile and thus all the data on it

02:26:40 <user39023> my question is -- I can't find the answer anywhere so I wonder if cell service providers are able to track my phone with graphene OS installed?
02:27:19 <user39023> T-Mobile recently disclosed their new privacy policy to sell data towards other companies. Even if I opt out of the policy, I still think they'll sell that data anyway. Does Graphene OS prevent that location data from leaking?

16:11:02 <IRCrevolution> hi
16:14:10 <IRCrevolution> how can i get the standalone graphene apps? (i.e. on a general ROM)
16:14:36 <IRCrevolution> https://grapheneos.org/contact#standalone-apps
16:14:52 <IRCrevolution> i thought they would be available on fdroid!!?
16:15:35 <ulmirdin[m]> You mean AOSP apps?
16:15:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "i thought they would be availabl"> They are distributed on Github releases or Play store
16:16:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "how can i get the standalone gra"> Say, PDFViewer is in github.com/grapheneos/platform_external_pdfviewer
16:16:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> * Say, PDFViewer is in https://github.com/grapheneos/platform_external_pdfviewer
16:17:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Replace pdfviewer on last part of the link with vanadium or auditor for those respective apps
16:18:30 <IRCrevolution> the github releases (.zip) dont contain apk, only source code. right!??
16:20:39 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "the github releases (.zip) dont "> Oh, my bad, I should have pointed on github.com/grapheneos/pdfviewer if you will look on release section
16:20:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Say, PDFViewer is in github.com/"> Here, the APKs are in the repo itself, in the folders
16:21:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> * Oh, my bad, I should have pointed on https://github.com/grapheneos/pdfviewer if you will look on release section
16:23:46 <IRCrevolution> yep got it. thanks :)
16:23:54 <IRCrevolution> any plans for getting these on fdroid!?
16:24:49 <IRCrevolution> i can file an rfp (request for packaging) issue on fdroid repo if that's wanted/welcome?!
16:26:26 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's up to them if they'll include it on official F-Droid repo iirc
16:26:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (The F-Droid developers)
16:27:05 <IRCrevolution> nope, its not upto them ðŸ˜…
16:27:44 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "nope, its not upto them ðŸ˜…"> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/issues/61#issuecomment-524001955
16:28:08 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Something to consider when requesting it to package on F-Droid
16:28:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Auditor will not function with the attestation server if the signature does not match
16:33:03 <IRCrevolution> ohkay. i am not a dev, so some part of it flew over my head. but what about venadium and pdf reader!? they have same hurdles too?
16:33:30 <IRCrevolution> {anyways thanks a lottt for quick replies}
16:38:55 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "ohkay. i am not a dev, so some p"> Similar in the sense that it is subject to F-Droid approval on bundling it in the repository
16:39:33 <IRCrevolution> ohkay
16:40:56 <IRCrevolution> also, the pdf viewer failed to open the pdf. does that have any connection with the fact that i have disabled the google play services?
16:41:09 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Nah
16:41:33 <IRCrevolution> so, any known reason why it didnt open any pdf?
16:43:30 <IRCrevolution> on going to properties, it says failed to obtaim document metadata
16:46:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Assuming it does not result to any appearance of snackbar (on error, such as "Cannot open legacy file paths from insecure apps") when opening the PDFViewer, check first if webview is enabled and updated
16:47:54 <IRCrevolution> from where?
16:49:12 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "from where?"> Settings?
16:49:13 <IRCrevolution> i have checked the developer options > set webview implementation. it shows blank in the popup dialog
16:49:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "i have checked the developer opt"> Oh, that's a problem, PDFViewer uses webview to render PDF
16:50:13 <IRCrevolution> so, my phone doesnt have webview!? right??
16:53:13 <KONCRETE[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "> <@leeya:kde.org> It's updated "> What's Molly?
16:53:19 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "so, my phone doesnt have webview"> It's disabled
16:53:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <KONCRETE[m] "What's Molly?"> Signal fork
16:53:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (see molly.im)
16:54:21 <IRCrevolution> i just checked my apps settings > shows system. and it has android system webview. but it is showing version 0.0.0.1
16:54:22 <IRCrevolution> "it's disabled" oh, okay
16:54:22 <IRCrevolution> it means i am stuck with google pdf viewer :(
16:55:54 <KONCRETE[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when? Which one do you think is better to install? Molly or FOSS-Molly
16:57:30 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Depends tbh, mostly the Play services dependencies on Molly/Signal is no-op in GrapheneOS
16:57:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <IRCrevolution "i just checked my apps settings "> You can enable and update it tho?
16:58:14 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Anyways, prefer to continue that convo in offtopic room
16:59:22 <IRCrevolution> yep, that is more suited to OT.
16:59:22 <IRCrevolution> back to on topic: any info about availability of other graphene apps to non graphene roms? (like dialer, sms, keyboard, music player etc)
17:00:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Not really, as those are built in the process of building the OS (and thus have no prebuilts available to download)
17:01:01 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Those are AOSP apps
17:05:28 <IRCrevolution> ohkayyy. the sad part is they started to come googled in newer version of android (â‰¥7). so, i was looking for alternates.
17:05:29 <IRCrevolution> they were better when they came aosp. now they are all google things. (like even calculator, calender too)
17:06:51 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Even if the APKs are extracted and provided, it will not work anyways with Android 10 and below, as those are built for Android 11-based OS
17:09:01 <IRCrevolution> thanks a lot for info. have a nice time :)
17:23:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Nâ€‹orwegianFrost> Any recommendations for SeedVault backup in cloud?Nextcloud is very meh
17:52:09 <ryanrambharose> Hello is there a link to the vanadium browser apk?
17:55:01 <pizzaeater69[m]> Vanadium is only on GrapheneOS and becomes pre-installed on it
17:55:22 <ryanrambharose> Ok
17:56:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> There are prebuilts at https://github.com/grapheneos/platform_external_vanadium
17:56:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Need to install library first, before anything else, only works for Android 10+
17:57:03 <strcat[m]> you can't use a WebView not included in the OS as a permitted one though
17:58:23 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Also, it takes advantage of GrapheneOS features which are absent on other OS (like the hardened_malloc), and it does not provide as much boost as using it on GrapheneOS
18:00:44 <cide[m]> not sure if this belongs on offtopic?? but what contacts/sms and calling app is recommended for use? since the default ones come with a warning that they were built for previous versions of android
18:04:17 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> None for legacy SMS/Calling?
18:06:22 <cide[m]> none? you mean not use sms?
18:06:22 <cide[m]> cant really do that atm
18:06:31 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <cide[m] "none? you mean not use sms?"> I meant the app recommendation
18:06:33 <cide[m]> so just use default then?
18:09:37 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Yes
18:10:24 <stealy> Â I am trying to use graphene web installer, but my browser is not detecting the phone
18:10:54 <cide[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Yes"> k but main issue there is can only save contacts to local storage, no sim option. is this intended behaviour?
18:10:57 <stealy> Windows 10. Edge Browser. All drivers updated
18:12:54 <entry1[m]> <stealy "Windows 10. Edge Browser. All dr"> Have you tried Google Chrome?

18:13:54 <stealy> I have tried another cable and a couple different ports. I don't need to have ADB installed for the web install process, do I?
18:14:44 <stealy> The instructions mentioned updating windows 10 drivers for fastboot driver. I updated all drivers but there wasn't a driver specifically for fastboot in the update list
18:15:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <stealy "I have tried another cable and a"> Nope, no need to install anything besides driver update, if there is any
18:18:43 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Trying other officially supported browser, and opening web console by pressing F12 in the process of flashing may help on finding the errors behind
18:40:10 <supervegetto777> What happened to the channel it had more than 1000 people on it?
18:59:56 <supervegetto777> Hi, i am using grapheneos with a oixel 4a, niw i am using a normal vpn app (mullvad) to blend in, and also i am using the orbit app because a friend told me vpn and the orbit app together are maximum security, because i m not that techyy i wonder anyone here knows if i m doin it right?
19:00:04 <supervegetto777> https://www.expressvpn.com/nl/vpn-service/tor-vpn
19:04:48 <cide[m]> orbit routes your traffic through tor afaik
19:05:19 <supervegetto777> Does that make it safer? I m not that tech
19:05:27 <cide[m]> using a vpn w/ that is overkill and im not sure how you're using it/if it' supported
19:06:09 <cide[m]> anyway it's going to kill your internet speeds fyi
19:07:00 <cide[m]> tor is already slow. unless youre in a journalist in a hostile country or something tor isn't really necessary imo
19:07:56 <supervegetto777> Okee thank you, so using signal without tor is safe also? Orbit doesnt bring extra security at all?
19:08:33 <cide[m]> im not sure what you mean by security
19:08:48 <cide[m]> tor just gives you privacy with good practices
19:09:57 <cide[m]> if you want privacy then use tor. vpns arent for privacy. you're just displacing trust from your isp to your vpn provider
19:10:32 <supervegetto777> And using tor make my traffic invisible for isp?
19:11:09 <cide[m]> yes, theyll know youre using tor though
19:11:11 <supervegetto777> I use vpn to hide my signal communication from isp, so they dont know who i am talking to, so orbit woukd do a better job for this?
19:11:49 <cide[m]> use e2e encryption for that
19:11:57 <cide[m]> signal supports it i think
19:12:00 <cide[m]> ?
19:12:05 <cide[m]> idk i dont use it, sorry
19:12:47 <cide[m]> from what youve told me i think tor is overkill for you
19:12:57 <cide[m]> just make sure your comms are encrypted if you dont want your isp to know whats in them
19:13:10 <supervegetto777> How doni enable e2e encryption in signal?
19:14:47 <cide[m]> pretty sure there are better places to discuss that since it's not grapheneos related
