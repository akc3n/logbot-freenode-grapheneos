00:38:04 <tintin_contre_rg> yes
00:38:04 <tintin_contre_rg> I wondered if i should have stressed this but yes i did
00:38:09 <j-james[m]> Yeah, double-check you're running a supported browser and operating system
00:38:20 <j-james[m]> Ah
00:38:40 <grapheneos_user_> Seems you running flashall.sh too early, should unlock bootloader/do everything else first
00:39:08 <grapheneos_user_> At least that's what it seemed like from "when the phone reboots" and mentioning the options
00:40:22 <tintin_contre_rg> I have archlinux and i tested the WebInstall with chromium
00:40:49 <tintin_contre_rg> and it is stuck here

00:41:08 <grapheneos_user_> Huh
00:41:13 <grapheneos_user_> Not sure
00:42:32 <grapheneos_user_> I'm not knowledgeable enough to help you further, sorry
00:42:52 <grapheneos_user_> Anyway your comic book taste is good
00:46:09 <tintin_contre_rg> Thanks :D
00:46:57 <strcat[m]> tintin_contre_rg: sounds like you either have 1) an unreliable USB connection from a bad cable or port, or 2) you have adb running in the background probably because you followed an unofficial guide with incorrect instructions
00:47:04 <strcat[m]> tintin_contre_rg: if adb is running in the background, kill it
00:47:06 <strcat[m]> or reboot
00:47:26 <strcat[m]> the most common issue is an unreliable USB connection
00:47:35 <strcat[m]> use the cable that comes with the device, without a hub / adapter
00:47:48 <jj1013[m]> Wotcher cock, TheJollyRoger.
00:47:48 <strcat[m]> if you cannot, use a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable from a brand like Apple, Anker, Google, etc.
00:48:05 <strcat[m]> if you use some random one, it probably won't work, because many USB-A to USB-C cables are broken / non-spec-compliant
00:48:15 <strcat[m]> you need a high quality cable
00:48:22 <strcat[m]> many of them cut corners
00:48:31 <strcat[m]> USB-C ecosystem is full of garbage that doesn't work
00:59:59 <tintin_contre_rg> Thanks a lot 😊
00:59:59 <tintin_contre_rg> You were right, i changed my cable and it worked perfectly
01:00:46 <TheJollyRoger> tintin_contre_rg: welcome aboard!
01:17:59 <dub_a> the ./flash-all.sh has been hanging for an hour now inside terminal. phone is at bootloader interface unlocked. Is this normal behavior?
01:19:37 <dub_a> flashing pixel 4a with manjaro
01:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> hi dub_a, your USB cable or USB slot is broken.
01:27:38 <TheJollyRoger> If you've gotten this far and fastboot enumerates the device properly, you've been able to complete the rest of the installation instructions properly, and you're using a current and supported version of fastboot, then what this indicates is your motherboard's firmware support for USB, or your cable or the slot it's plugged into is missing one or more wires.
01:28:53 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure you are using the Google branded cable, or one made by Anker, Aukey, or Apple; most other USB cables only implement the barest minimum of features they think that the average consumer will use and don't bother testing their cables or wiring them for doing debugging like what fastboot needs to do to do its good work. The same goes for lots of consumer-grade hardware, PC motherboards,
01:28:55 <TheJollyRoger> and laptops.
01:29:55 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure that the cable is plugged directly into the motherboard; no hubs, no splitters, no adapters.
01:32:10 <TheJollyRoger> If you are using the Google Brand cable, if USB autonegotiation is failing at the host, unplug the cable and twist the connector 180 degrees, and plug it in upsde-down at the computer's side, or even try it on a different port with a different cable and repeat. If ./flash-all has hung, it's safe to halt it and try again.
01:32:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hope this helps.
01:41:06 <dub_a> Right, I feared the cable that was shipped with the phone wouldn't be sufficient. I'm unable to verify the exact brand of the cable currently in use so I'll just find a proper one and retry a bit later, thank you!
01:57:57 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: If you bought your phone new and in the box factory sealed, there should be a white cable with squared off ends that came with it. That's a Google branded cable which should work for the installation.
01:58:55 <TheJollyRoger> If you are using the Google branded cable, then what you're likely looking at is a firmware problem on your motherboard not adequately and fully implementing all the features that fastboot needs to talk to the device bootloader, OR a physically broken USB slot.
02:04:58 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: see https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications
02:05:13 <hitchhooker[m]> cheers
02:05:36 <TheJollyRoger> thanks, strcat[m].
02:10:32 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: it's push messaging, generically
02:10:43 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: push notifications are just one use case for it
02:11:04 <strcat[m]> when you have Signal in the foreground, on either the stock OS or GrapheneOS, it has a connection to their server and is using push from their server
02:11:16 <strcat[m]> when Signal goes into the background, then on GrapheneOS, it relies on the foreground service to continue doing it the same way
02:11:24 <strcat[m]> for the stock OS, it switches to FCM to avoid the foreground service
02:11:30 <strcat[m]> either way, the implementation is essentially the same
02:11:58 <strcat[m]> it's just with FCM, Google Play services is keeping open the connection to Google's servers and Signal's server sends a message to Google servers which is delivered by FCM to the app on the user's device
02:12:06 <strcat[m]> apps can easily do this themselves
02:12:23 <strcat[m]> keep open connection for push, which they probably already do when in the foreground, and use a foreground service to keep themselves going
02:12:30 <strcat[m]> ask for battery optimization exception to deal with device idle states
02:12:42 <strcat[m]> all Signal had to do was add foreground service + ask for battery optimization exception, it was trivial code
02:12:55 <strcat[m]> it would be nice if they optimized their push implementation significantly too
02:13:06 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: anyway explain all this in this new section
02:17:02 <hitchhooker[m]> what I've understood moxie aint too interested to doing extra work for signal not be dependant on play services, so probably wont happen as long as there is some easy to implement alternative for fcm
02:18:07 <strcat[m]> it's not that hard, all they have to do is detect if it's an IPv6 connection, and if so, throttle it more, and add stats on how well it's working, for throttling it dynamically
02:18:23 <strcat[m]> it can start doing less frequent checks, and as long as that's working fine, keep making it less frequent, to a certain point
02:18:28 <strcat[m]> and just don't bother with it on IPv4
02:18:45 <strcat[m]> the issue is that each app has different kinds of connections/protocols
02:18:56 <strcat[m]> and it needs to be optimized per app
02:19:04 <strcat[m]> FCM is Google's brute force approach to enforcing using a good implementation
02:19:05 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: I'm not sure what you mean, Moxie's already made Signal fully independent of Play Services, it uses them if they are present, but if they aren't, it has full and complete functionality without them.
02:19:15 <strcat[m]> it makes sense, but it sucks having it centralized through Google servers
02:19:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
02:19:52 <TheJollyRoger> Whisper Systems even aggressively optimized Signal to reduce battery consumption as a foreground service. It used to be a *lot* hungrier before.
02:19:56 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to have an open standard implementation
02:19:58 <strcat[m]> where the app checks where the server should be sending push messages and sets it up with the server
02:20:06 <strcat[m]> and then we could host a server for GrapheneOS users to receive push messages
02:20:12 <TheJollyRoger> That would be really awesome!
02:20:19 <strcat[m]> so, yes, in theory, it is possible for someone to implement this kind of library + service
02:20:21 <strcat[m]> and we could host it
02:20:36 <strcat[m]> but it does no good for apps that are not adopting it as an alternative to FCM when it's available
02:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense.
02:23:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> CHRISL7 | Lavender/Surya 🇧🇷 (@C​HRISL7) has joined the Telegram Group!
02:24:05 <dub_a> I purchased the pixel refurbished, the cable seemed sturdy and was packed in a way that lead me to believe that it may have been the original cable. Nonetheless, I picked up a anker cable to test out. If it is my current device's motherboard, I'll try on a secondary to confirm. Hopefully that won't be necessary
02:26:01 <strcat[m]> dub_a: the devices only come with USB-C to USB-C cables
02:26:03 <strcat[m]> no USB-C to USB-A
02:26:18 <strcat[m]> there's only a USB-C to USB-A adapter for plugging in flash drives, etc.
02:27:38 <hitchhooker[m]> anyways thanks for writing out clarification how push messaging works, was nice read.
02:28:57 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: Ah, yeah, it probably isn't the original then if it's secondhand.
02:29:17 <TheJollyRoger> The Anker one, if it's USB 3.1 Gen 1 or later, should do it.
02:30:49 <strcat[m]> hitchhooker: all the app has to do is keep open a TCP connection to their server and occasionally send a no-op message over it so it doesn't get dropped and so they get an error if it did get silently dropped
02:31:13 <strcat[m]> a reliable network won't silently drop connections, it will give the app an exception to handle
02:31:25 <strcat[m]> so mostly it just works from keeping open a connection, on a reliable network
02:32:01 <strcat[m]> you do have to deal with it dropping, but you can throttle that, and then it can be very efficient
02:32:10 <strcat[m]> Signal just doesn't bother with that logic beyond the basic part of it
02:34:27 <anotherguy[m]> randomchar-dnsotls-ds.metric.gstatic.com
02:34:52 <anotherguy[m]> <anotherguy[m] "randomchar-dnsotls-ds.metric.gst"> this alwys show up at my net logs
02:36:01 <tor3nduser[m]> does the same thing apply to signal if you downloaded it directly from their website as opposed to any play store
02:36:13 <anotherguy[m]> I assume google trying to look up at my DoT, am I correct ?
02:37:01 <TheJollyRoger> tor3nduser[m]: If you check the signature on the manifest, they should be signed by the same keys. The only functional difference between the website release, and the Play Store release, is that the Play store release does not have the ability to keep itself updated.
02:38:29 <TheJollyRoger> This is simply to comply with Google's policy of "don't encourage the users to give or normalize giving apps permission to install other apps"
02:38:32 <tor3nduser[m]> ok so as far as the foreground/background functionality, it is the same as if you were to download signal on ,for example, aurora store instead
02:38:49 <TheJollyRoger> tor3nduser[m]: It's exactly the same.
02:38:53 <tor3nduser[m]> ok
02:41:38 <TheJollyRoger> anotherguy[m]: That's not a default connection made by GrapheneOS, the only default connections a bare-bones stock install of GrapheneOS makes are documented at https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
02:41:57 <TheJollyRoger> I'm guessing it's one of your apps dialing out.
02:47:26 <anotherguy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anotherguy: That's not a default"> It's just happened since the first time I change Private DNS. I always found this traffic since on stock OS.
02:49:28 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm.
02:52:15 <tor3nduser[m]> you guys ever see your graphene phone make carrier related dns queries?
02:55:17 <strcat[m]> tor3nduser: that's normal, texts and calls for LTE and beyond use data
02:55:33 <strcat[m]> it's a good thing
02:55:46 <tor3nduser[m]> <strcat[m] "tor3nduser: that's normal, texts"> ill give you an example. i want another opinion
02:56:37 <tor3nduser[m]> A record for wo.vzwwo.com
02:57:33 <tor3nduser[m]> verizon obviously but id like to know the purpose of it
03:00:13 <grapheneos_user_> tor3nduser search the domain on google
03:00:45 <tor3nduser[m]> i did a whois lookup and cant find shit lol
03:03:02 <skwisgaar[m]> tor3nduser: looks like it’s related to verizon wifi calling
03:03:56 <tor3nduser[m]> yea i figured it would be something related like that. im pretty sure i have wifi calling disabled 🤔
03:05:12 <ShawnC> I did a factory data reset from within the recovery and when it was formatting there were a bunch of lines that said "E: can't send spi message: Try again". What is that about?
03:05:12 <strcat[m]> as I said above
03:05:18 <strcat[m]> texts and calls on LTE and beyond are via data
03:05:36 <strcat[m]> you should see connections involving the carrier unless something is broken
03:06:26 <tor3nduser[m]> i know i wasnt arguing with that. i just was wondering what specifically it was related to. ..
03:06:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Ryan has joined the Telegram Group!
03:07:26 <tor3nduser[m]> obviously its LTE related.  🙄
03:19:18 <strcat[m]> tor3nduser: texts/calls use SIP for LTE and beyond
03:19:24 <strcat[m]> IMS is the generic platform for it
03:19:40 <strcat[m]> it's VOIP
03:29:41 <strcat[m]> new release in stable channel now too
03:48:22 <akc3n> Thanks strcat[m]
03:58:58 <tor3nduser[m]> is it advised to not use private dns if youre routing all traffic through tor with orbot?
04:17:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> I dont believe private dns matters at that point if you are routing everything through orbot
04:20:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Okay nevermind looks like dns leaks when private dns is set up

06:30:44 <iccedlemontea[m]> Tip for anyone updating the system, keep a fan pointed at the phone during the update as it gets super hot
06:33:08 <nscnt[m]> You did it twice in a row.... You can expect that
06:34:54 <nscnt[m]> As soon as your phone was back on, it immediately tried to install the update again
06:36:48 <nscnt[m]> Because you were back on the old version instead of giving the device time to fully complete the new update
06:40:59 <nscnt[m]> Android uses A/B system updates. If an OTA fails to boot, the device reboots back to the old partition

10:42:55 <g405t[m]> <nscnt[m] "g405t: It would be a self-built "> no not at all just  a copy of my own phone (including all settings and apps) tried adb backup but the apps didnt come with the backup
10:51:19 <nscnt[m]> g405t: To answer your initial question: No, you cannot copy your image and flash it on another device. You could backup with Seedvault to back up apps and app data of the owner user, install GrapheneOS on another device and restore the backup. There would be "issues" like apps can refuse to be backed up and so on. I wouldn't bother doing that.
10:51:48 <somenerd[m]> I don't believe that apps can be restored (not sure about this though)
10:52:52 <g405t[m]> Yeah tried it with adb was no success at all
10:54:04 <g405t[m]> I guess ill just keep a map of apks and transfer them to every phone manually
10:54:28 <somenerd[m]> providing a certain setup would probably require building GrapheneOS with those apps
10:54:54 <somenerd[m]> > I guess ill just keep a map of apks and transfer them to every phone manually
10:54:54 <somenerd[m]> yeah, probably a lot easier to do this

10:56:28 <somenerd[m]> yeah, and for OTA updates, there also needs to be an update server
10:57:09 <g405t[m]> I know, not worth it at all
10:58:38 <g405t[m]> thanks for the suggestions though guys, much appreciated 👌🏼
12:06:49 <icebergfive> Any community consensus or official recommendations for 2FA and password manager apps for use with GrapheneOS?
12:08:03 <KONCRETE[m]> Not official, But you can try aegis for your 2FA
12:08:12 <KONCRETE[m]> Or a Yubikey

12:17:33 <tintin_contre_rg> Hey, does someone have any idea why my pixel phone doesn't recognize my sim card ?
12:19:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> tintin_contre_rg: hi! which carrier?
12:20:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​astidVW> If the Pixel is Verizon branded and you try to use it on another carrier ....you're out of luck
12:25:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if and only if it was carrier locked

12:29:26 <wiegolf[m]> The sim is activated and works on another mobile?
12:29:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> welp, you might try to go directly to the office of your carrier to resolve this issue
12:30:39 <wiegolf[m]> If you just activated you might have to wait 2-12 hours .... This is common for new activated sim cards
12:31:15 <tintin_contre_rg> <wiegolf[m] "The sim is activated and works o"> Yes it worked with my previous phone. Ans in fact i receive one sms with this one and then it stopped working
12:31:45 <wiegolf[m]> Reboot without sim reboot with sim...
12:32:38 <wiegolf[m]> And clean the sim surface
12:34:12 <wiegolf[m]> In settings there is an entry "status of sim card" ... does it show up there?
12:35:08 <tintin_contre_rg> I did all of this
12:35:43 <tintin_contre_rg> And the status tells it doesn't detect any sim card
12:36:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> in some countries there is an additional registration that needed to be done when switching sim cards from one phone to another. Stuff like sending your IMEI with a national ID number to the gov officials is common
12:39:22 <tintin_contre_rg> OK, i never heard something like that before but i'll try to contact SFR thanks for your help

13:37:36 <akc3n[m]> <kskdj[m] "Is there an app I can use to cha"> When you're connected to the cellular network, it knows your IMEI. That's how a cell phone network works. Different sim cards give you a different subscriptions, but not a different IMEI. The way it works is your IMEI identifies the radio uniquely.

15:12:53 <minodesign> and I am wondering if is possible to build a sort of "generic Graphene OS" on a Gigaset android
15:13:05 <skyecc[m]> What can I do. I forgot to update pixel 5 before flashing and now it seems bricked. It stopped process after partition
15:13:33 <minodesign> or a sort of Graphene OS based os installed on a Gigaset GS260
15:13:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> skyecc[m]: pixel 5 should be fine without prior updating

15:14:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> minodesign: I'm not qualified enough to help you, but I know that you can build GrapheneOS for a x86
15:15:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> skyecc[m]: why are you not using the web installer?
15:15:12 <minodesign> yes I also not expert on building
15:15:47 <minodesign> the Gigaset 260 is also the Volla Phone
15:15:52 <skyecc[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg: i have used this one before without problems
15:16:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Are you following a YouTube video of some sort? That's very bad, the only proper installation is here https://grapheneos.org/install/
15:16:51 <minodesign> they are adapting a Gigaset Android branch for their Volla OS

15:17:18 <minodesign> hardening something
15:17:21 <skyecc[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg: no doing exactly what's in official webpage
15:17:40 <skyecc[m]> Is there some way to reset device
15:17:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> skyecc[m]: which step are you on?
15:18:17 <minodesign> I think they should start from Graphene OS, checking from Android 11 and then fix
15:18:39 <skyecc[m]> Flash-all.bat
15:19:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> ok, so what kind error did you get?
15:20:26 <skyecc[m]> Nothing it stopped after partition. Finished waiting for device. But process is longer.
15:20:59 <skyecc[m]> Last one is rebooting to bootloader okay. Then nothing

15:24:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Sorry, I don't want to take responsibility for bricking your brand new phone, so just stay where you are, and wait for help
15:25:29 <skyecc[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg: ok thanks. Who is dev or mod here?
15:26:00 <skyecc[m]> Ok I'll wait. I think it's bricked already

15:35:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> period.
15:36:04 <wasbear[m]> Okay

15:45:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> 👋
15:50:55 <user1182[m]> Hey guys, I installed GrapheneOS 03.19.14 about a week ago, shortly thereafter I received the push notification for an update. For the better part of the week that update has been stuck in the same place (about 1/4th of the way done) and trying 'check for updates' results in nothing. Should I try to install 4.05.20 manually and then hope that the automatic updates work from there on out?
15:51:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> user1182[m]: hi, and welcome
15:51:44 <user1182[m]> ^release channel stable, permitted networks any, been on wifi the whole time but no cellular.
15:51:47 <user1182[m]> Hello!
15:51:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> pls don't install anything
15:52:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> You're most likely updated already
15:52:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just check your build number
15:52:37 <user1182[m]> forgot to say build number is still 03.19.14
15:52:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> "Seamless update" does indeed updates the system seamlessly
15:53:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> The "check for updates" button does not give any user feedback
15:53:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That's just how it works :P
15:55:04 <user1182[m]> Should I try to force stop the seamless update client and reboot the phone? I've rebooted a few times and the update progress hasn't moved
15:55:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh sorry, just reread your messages
15:56:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hmm, what does your Auditor says?
15:56:38 <user1182[m]> Oh, I haven't done the auditor, I did not have a compatible device to do it
15:56:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Just do the remote attestation in this case
15:57:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Sam (@s​ameizad) has joined the Telegram Group!
15:58:25 <user1182[m]> I will do that now and get back to you asap. Thank you

16:02:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Default is good👍
16:02:49 <user1182[m]> thank you, successfully submitted remote attestation
16:05:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so, what did the attestation say?
16:07:21 <user1182[m]> What should I be looking for?
16:08:01 <user1182[m]> os patch level is still 2021-03
16:08:09 <user1182[m]> according to the attestation website
16:08:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> is your gos "clean"?
16:11:20 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <user1182[m] "os patch level is still 2021-03"> Sounds about right, since monthly update still in Beta channel
16:11:38 <user1182[m]> I'm not seeing anything mentioning "clean" on the attestation site, sorry
16:12:29 <user1182[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Sounds about right, since monthl"> I thought 4.05 is on the stable channel now?
16:12:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> patch level != Build number
16:15:03 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <user1182[m] "I thought 4.05 is on the stable "> Is it? I haven't checked recently
16:16:13 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <user1182[m] "I thought 4.05 is on the stable "> Oh yeah, it's possible that the seamless update that time downloaded the build before 04.05 as it's only pushed to stable recently (you're right)

16:18:58 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <user1182[m] "I'm not seeing anything mentioni"> It's not exactly will mention "clean", it'll say " Successfully paired..." or something like that after two remote attestations

16:22:32 <somenerd[m]> yeah, don't think it is
16:22:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> user1182[m]: my knowledge ends here, i do not know how to help you with your updates issue
16:23:27 <Gladox114[m]> well on the page with cli it shows commads for arch linux which works on Manjaro. There isn't really a huge difference because Manjaro is based on arch
16:23:32 <user1182[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> user1182: my knowledge e"> Thank you for trying, it's ok. Sorry I'm not more knowledgeable, learning alot though!
16:24:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Gladox114[m]: the point is, if you use non-supported OS, no one will help you, you will be on your own
16:25:07 <Gladox114[m]> But arch linux is Manjaro and where can I read what is supported as OS?
16:25:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> or i should have said, don't expect anyone to help you
16:25:21 <Gladox114[m]>  * But Manjaro is arch linux  and where can I read what is supported as OS?
16:25:21 <somenerd[m]> supported OSs are specifically tested on

16:25:35 <Gladox114[m]> <somenerd[m] "supported OSs are specifically t"> ah ok
16:25:43 <somenerd[m]> so there may be a few changes which cause problems on Manjaro

16:26:06 <user1182[m]> Take it from someone who tried to do it through cmd, I had no idea what I was doing. Web install saved my ass lol
16:27:43 <somenerd[m]> unless you want to distrust the server and verify images, you don't really want to use the cli install
16:28:02 <somenerd[m]> (and you need to understand the instructions rather than blindly follow them)
16:29:13 <Gladox114[m]> yeah I understand the commands but I probably will just use the web version

16:42:06 <tor3nduser[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Something about Pixel 4/5 series"> i dont think so.  thats why they emphasize making sure you have the correct image in the instructions
16:43:22 <tor3nduser[m]> the only other thing i can think of is (if usb debugging is allowed still in his case) plugging into a pc and using adb to fix it
16:43:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <tor3nduser[m] "i dont think so.  thats why they"> Agreed

16:55:52 <tor3nduser[m]> the guy towards the bottom says it will remove all partitions and data.
16:56:11 <tor3nduser[m]> which, if true, will let you flash an os to the devicre again
16:56:51 <tor3nduser[m]> do more research though. dont just rely on that one page.
17:16:47 <dazinism> user1182: could try going into settings > apps > show system > seamless update and delete the storage from the app. May sort out your issue. Not sure whats happening or why.
17:18:40 <dazinism> Can't remember anyone else  having that issue.
17:19:53 <dazinism> One possibility is you've changed something thats stopped the seamless updater app getting a network connection
17:21:42 <dazinism> user1182 if thats the case you'll have to change things so it can connect again

17:43:08 <dazinism> Think its much more likely to be a problem with the WiFi network
17:43:39 <dazinism> Know experienced people spend hours trying to work out why some devices work and others not
17:43:56 <bson989[m]> Okay thanks. It's just odd my device is the only one affected
17:46:32 <dazinism> bson989: yeah, I've recently heard stories (not related to GrapheneOS) with WiFi networks working with some devices and others not.
17:46:43 <dazinism> Depends how the WiFi network is set up

18:40:27 <helloworldkk87[m> What
18:41:08 <helloworldkk87[m> Do you mean why is it unlocked or what
18:41:38 <TheJollyRoger> m4g3nt4[m]: if it says "no valid slot to boot" then the wrong partition has been flashed.
18:42:24 <m4g3nt4[m]> How can the problem be solved?
18:42:35 <TheJollyRoger> Generally, this problem is caused by using an incorrect, outdated, or third-party version of fastboot, or the installer erroring out. In which case, use the web installer and run the web installer again.
18:43:01 <TheJollyRoger> m4g3nt4[m]: go to https://grapheneos.org/install/web and follow the instructions there.
18:43:30 <jj1013[m]> <m4g3nt4[m] "20210407_203903_3550755093215113"> You must **NOT** show your serial number to anybody as far as I know.
18:43:31 <TheJollyRoger> If it gives you "no valid slot to boot" after using the web installer, try to boot it and see if it returns to fastboot or it detects the correct slot.
18:44:20 <TheJollyRoger> If it detects the correct slot, then return to fastboot and lock the bootloader so that it displays the "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen.
18:44:37 <Gladox114[m]> Is it possible to run google stock Camera application? Would this be a bad idea because of maybe telemetry?
18:46:16 <TheJollyRoger> Gladox114[m]: A few people here have figured out how to run an older release of Google Camera, but the general recommendation is not to do it, the exception in the security policy that allows it to run may be removed soon and it is likely that it will stop working in the future.
18:49:36 <pinkylittlecat[m> you can find in xda a modified google camera version with no dependency on gms
18:50:47 <pinkylittlecat[m> afaik it was not optimized for pixel 4a but it still works well, it does not use all the AI features of pixel 4a because it was not optimized for it
18:51:12 <pinkylittlecat[m> better to talk about it in the offtopic channel btw
18:51:22 <Gladox114[m]> ahright
18:52:29 <apexibex[m]> there's a caveat for that modded gcam. the source is not available so you have to rely on faith that there's no malicious code
18:53:14 <apexibex[m]> this is even mentioned by the guy who hosts the links
18:54:01 <apexibex[m]> but AFAIK there hasn't been any known issues with the mod
18:54:34 <apexibex[m]> not trying to spread FUD, but you should be aware
18:56:46 <TheJollyRoger> Of course.
19:08:42 <dar_gomml[m]> apexibex: which mod would that be?

19:18:29 <TheJollyRoger> m4g3nt4[m]: what happens when you select "start?"
19:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> Does it return you to Fastboot?
19:18:38 <skyecc[m]> tor3nduser: fastboot can't find device at all so can't send any commands.  It's just waiting for device
19:18:59 <m4g3nt4[m]> <TheJollyRoger "m4g3nt4: what happens when you s"> Nothing
19:19:34 <m4g3nt4[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Does it return you to Fastboot?"> Yes
19:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> m4g3nt4[m]: Ok, can you back up and describe to me exactly how you got to this position? What commands did you run, what software have you used...?
19:24:28 <nodenerd> Hi, so after doing some researching on the chat here, I see that it's not possible to 'rollback' to a previous version of the OS for security reasons. Would it be possible though to somehow flash an older version of the OS and then just disable system updates.. will the system allow me to install an older version at all?
19:24:39 <m4g3nt4[m]> <TheJollyRoger "m4g3nt4: Ok, can you back up and"> I installed GrapheneOS with the CLI install
19:25:20 <TheJollyRoger> m4g3nt4[m]: can you post the output of "fastboot --version" to me, please?
19:25:24 <TheJollyRoger> I have an idea of what went wrong.
19:25:30 <m4g3nt4[m]> Yes
19:25:54 <TheJollyRoger> hi nodenerd, if you want to install an older version of the operating system, you must find an older release, then you must unlock the bootloader.
19:26:29 <nodenerd> Hey TheJollyRoger yes I have a slightly older image here I could flash
19:26:49 <nodenerd> But the phone already has the latest version (today's update) on it
19:26:57 <nodenerd> So it would be a manual rollback
19:27:18 <m4g3nt4[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I have an idea of what went wron"> fastboot version 31.0.0-android-tools
19:29:12 <TheJollyRoger> nodenerd: yeah. You can unlock the bootloader and re flash but you'll need to unlock the bootloader. Everything on that phone will be lost in the process - all photos, files, apps, etc.
19:29:37 <nodenerd> Yes ok that would be fine, I shall give that a try, great, thanks!
19:29:57 <TheJollyRoger> m4g3nt4[m]: Hmm. Very strange if it's version 31 and it's doing that and failing autodetection. Stay posted in this channel, hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I can help you out.
19:30:16 <TheJollyRoger> nodenerd: Good luck, it shouldn't take you long. Back everything up first, there is no recovering data that's been deleted after the phone changes keys.
19:31:20 <nodenerd> Yep understood, thanks a lot for your help!

21:11:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> murmr: before you continue
21:11:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> it's highly recommended to read the whole page before following the instructions
21:18:36 <murmr> is the flashing process ok to run multiple times? got a timeout error during flashing but it looks like fastboot is open on the phone
21:19:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> hmmmm
21:19:24 <murmr> specifically: timeout of 10000ms exceeded
21:19:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i didn't encounter such problem before
21:19:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so, bootloader unlocking went successful?
21:19:55 <murmr> yes
21:20:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> and you are using the official cable which came with your phone?

21:29:49 <jj1013[m]> USB-A is the common USB port on a desktop computer as far as I am concerned.
21:29:55 <murmr> sure, so when i have a machine w usb-c, on the phone do I exit out of fastbootd and back into the bootloader? Then re-obtain and flash on a different machine?

21:31:29 <jj1013[m]> <murmr "sure, so when i have a machine w"> You just have to get an Anker cable (USB-C to USB-A). When you get it ready, you start the flashing process.

21:33:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> yeah, but given that you might have friends and/or family this is not a big problem
21:33:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Then there's my mom's Redmi Note 9 or something.

21:39:01 <murmr> jj1013[m]: right, asking if the flashing process via the web install is idempotent, and what state the phone should be in to redo the flashing step (leave in fastbootd vs the bootloader)

22:15:03 <rhclayto> Hello, Peter Easton directed me here. Thank you Peter! I have a question about VPNs in GrapeheneOS. I have read the FAQ at https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support. With regards to setting an app-provided VPN at Settings ➔ Network & Internet ➔ Advanced ➔ VPN, should this be set independently in each individual user profile? Or would setting it in the Owner profile apply to secondary user profiles?
22:20:12 <rhclayto> My specific situation is that I am trying to run an app called InviZible (https://github.com/Gedsh/InviZible). Bascially it runs Tor client & dnscrypt-proxy, then sets itself up as an Android VPN & routes all traffic through them. It works flawlessly in the owner profile, but it has no effect on traffic from secondary user profiles. If I then install it into a user profile, it doesn't appear as a candidate in the Android VPN settings (Settings ??
22:20:12 <rhclayto> ? Network & Internet ➔ Advanced ➔ VPN).
22:21:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rhclayto: hi!
22:22:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> let me try to help you)
22:22:25 <rhclayto> Hi !Hulk.
22:23:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> so, I don't know how to fix this problem with this app (i never used it), but here is some highly recommended reading for you https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/
22:23:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> speicifically https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/encrypted-dns
22:23:56 <entry1> rhclayto is this not similar to Orbot?
22:24:43 <Lynn[m]> <icebergfive "Any community consensus or offic"> Aegis, and KeePassDX (ChaCha20 as the encryption algorithm, and Argon2id for the key derivation function).
22:24:58 <rhclayto> Yes, it's similar to Orbot, but in addition to Tor also does DNSCrypt & I2P.
22:28:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rhclayto: also, this https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/vpns.html
22:28:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> as i said, highly recommended reading
22:29:01 <odinos[m]> I'm having the same problem as described in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/flyn5b/whatsapp_periodically_becoming_inactive/
22:29:13 <rhclayto> Suppose I were not using this app, InviZible, instead I used Orbot. Would I need to install Orbot on every user profile, or on the owner profile which would then corral all user profile traffic into the VPN? It's not clear from the FAQ.
22:29:17 <odinos[m]> a
22:30:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rhclayto: that's why you should read https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/vpns

I like this app because it allows me to route some apps through Tor, & other apps through a VPN (first through Shadowsocks on my own VPS paid for with cryptocurrency, with the obfs plugin), & DNS, goes to DNSCrypt servers, using DNSCrypt's anonymous proxy feature.
22:34:03 <steaks[m]> I just bought a Pixel 5 from AT&T. I just found out you can't install grapheneos on a locked phone. Did I just waste $700?
22:34:25 <akc3n[m]> Hi rhclayto this may be considered an offtopic discussion as per rule 2a. https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
22:34:25 <akc3n[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic on freenode.
22:34:25 <akc3n[m]> PS, yes you would have to install Orbot on the  profiles you would want to use it on.
22:34:32 <entry1> <rhclayto "Suppose I were not using this ap"> Each profile to my knowledge since they are essentially separate.
22:35:04 <rhclayto> !Hulk, thanks again for the links, but they don't give any guidance about how GrapheneOS should be configured, even with the recommendad apps from the FAQ.
22:35:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> rhclayto: welp, that's as much as i could do to help you)

22:36:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> steaks[m]: hello!
22:36:10 <rhclayto> entry1: Thanks. akc3n: I will be happy to ask over there. But really I'm just asking how the VPN configuration works on GrapheneOS.
22:36:13 <steaks[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Hulk> steaks: hello!"> hi!
22:36:37 <entry1> You will have to install the VPN app on each profile and configure "VPN always on" for profiles you always want the VPN connected on. If you do this. What are you trying to do exactly with VPNs within the OS?
22:36:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should go to At&T and ask them to unlock your phone

22:36:51 <odinos[m]> <odinos[m] "I'm having the same problem as d"> is there any other advice someone can give me apart from daniels comment posted there?
22:37:19 <steaks[m]> Thank you both! I will try both of those options
22:37:21 <entry1> It is no different to stock android for VPNs to my knowledge rhclayto
22:37:38 <steaks[m]> I didn't know carriers could unlock phones for you
22:38:01 <rhclayto> entry1: I will try that with Orbot, since the app I have tried with doesn't show up as a candidate in the options at Settings ➔ Network & Internet ➔ Advanced ➔ VPN

22:38:34 <rhclayto> To clarify, it shows up & works in the owner profile, but not in the user profiles.

22:39:30 <entry1> rhclayto
22:39:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> also steaks[m]: if i were you, i would just return the locked phone (as it is brand new, right?) and by the phone directly from Google
