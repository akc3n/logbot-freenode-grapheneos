00:00:00 <madaidan[m]> "no good"
00:00:00 <madaidan[m]> I would commit unspeakable actions to get a workstation that good
00:00:04 <strcat[m]> my current workstation was hit really hard by all the spectre/meltdown mitigations
00:00:10 <strcat[m]> it is so much slower now
00:00:12 <strcat[m]> it's ridiculous
00:00:12 <HowardR> So I would specify x86_64 instead of redfin?
00:00:25 <strcat[m]> HowardR: what are you trying to do? I need to know that
00:00:40 <Lestat[m]> i understand but im in no position to get a monster pc
00:00:40 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3970x
00:00:45 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: this is the worst CPU I am considering getting
00:00:46 <Lestat[m]> Not just the lockdown but in general
00:00:53 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I wish zen 3 threadripper was out
00:00:57 <strcat[m]> I really can't wait for it
00:00:58 <HowardR> I'm trying to build from source like the build page says
00:01:16 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: maybe I should do a zen 2 threadripper build and then do zen 3 when it comes out and just have 2 workstations
00:01:17 <strcat[m]> shrug
00:01:37 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I pretty much consider my current workstation trash tier now other than the NVMe SSD still being good
00:01:42 <strcat[m]> will probably reuse the same SSD
00:02:08 <strcat[m]> Samsung 960 Pro 2TB still more than good enough other than being ridiculously small
00:02:33 <HowardR> Did you not understand what I was doing?
00:02:41 <strcat[m]> I checked and Samsung somehow doesn't have 4TB/8TB SSDs yet despite my 2TB one being from over 4 years ago
00:02:46 <strcat[m]> HowardR: what are you trying to build for
00:02:56 <strcat[m]> HowardR:  a release to run in the emulator for development? or to run on a Pixel 5?
00:03:20 <Lestat[m]> So i can still contribute even with my piece of shit workstation right?
00:03:21 <HowardR> I'm trying to build the dev (11) branch for Pixel5/redfin
00:03:33 <strcat[m]> HowardR: so, for a Pixel 5
00:03:37 <strcat[m]> HowardR: why are you using the emulator then?
00:03:52 <HowardR> I don't have a Pixel phone
00:04:10 <strcat[m]> HowardR: it's really better to build for the emulator then
00:04:23 <strcat[m]> HowardR: https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets
00:04:25 <strcat[m]> `rm -rf out`
00:04:37 <Lestat[m]> <Lestat[m] "So i can still contribute even w"> Its just gonna be 6 hours to compile
00:04:40 <strcat[m]> and do it again with `sdk_phone_x86_64` as the target
00:05:10 <strcat[m]> and then run `emulator` in the shell you set up with `source script/envsetup.sh` (you can also set up a 2nd one but keep in mind you need to run `choosecombo` in each if you want to build with them)
00:05:27 <strcat[m]> HowardR: you'll be way happier with `sdk_phone_x86_64` + using `emulator` command, you don't need to deal with setting up the SDK emulator
00:05:28 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: I pretty much conside"> If that's trash tier then I wonder what mine is...
00:05:33 <strcat[m]> the AOSP source tree has an emulator
00:05:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Emulator? Which one?
00:05:39 <strcat[m]>  * the AOSP source tree has a copy of the emulator
00:05:46 <strcat[m]> and the one in the source tree doesn't need to manually set up
00:05:54 <gnujihad[m]> Hey guys!
00:05:57 <madaidan[m]> <Lestat[m] "So i can still contribute even w"> Yes
00:05:59 <strcat[m]> they have a script that automatically opens all the correct images from your current `choosecombo` target
00:06:19 <Lestat[m]> Awesome
00:06:28 <gnujihad[m]> Graphene
00:06:28 <gnujihad[m]> Has 3 carbon atoms covalently bonded together making them strong asf but has a delocalised electron which carries electrical current therefore it can conduct electricity also it‚Äôs kinda faggurt and the layers have weak intermolecular forced making them slide over each other which is what makes graphene soft ü§¨ üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
00:06:32 <strcat[m]> Lestat: you can contribute to OS dev with that it'll just be inconvenient
00:07:07 <strcat[m]> gnu/jihad: can you not? thanks
00:07:18 <gnujihad[m]> Wow
00:07:37 <strcat[m]> gnu/jihad: #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
00:07:39 <Lestat[m]> <strcat[m] "Lestat: you can contribute to OS"> Dunno about inconvenient...i always have 2 machines doing something in the background so one more isnt really painful lol
00:08:04 <HowardR> So every place the instructions say DEVICE I should specify x86_64?
00:08:12 <strcat[m]> HowardR: no
00:08:29 <strcat[m]> see this part?
00:08:31 <strcat[m]> `choosecombo release aosp_sunfish user`
00:08:37 <strcat[m]> for development with emulator
00:08:39 <strcat[m]> do this:
00:08:49 <strcat[m]> `choosecombo release sdk_phone_x86_64 userdebug`
00:09:13 <strcat[m]> HowardR: you don't use this section: https://grapheneos.org/build#extracting-vendor-files-for-pixel-devices
00:09:22 <strcat[m]> you basically just do:
00:09:26 <strcat[m]> `source script/envsetup.sh`
00:09:34 <strcat[m]> `choosecombo release sdk_phone_x86_64 userdebug`
00:09:34 <strcat[m]> `m`
00:09:37 <strcat[m]> then when it's built:
00:09:39 <strcat[m]> `emulator`
00:10:04 <HowardR> I've read that build document over and over. Do I not run the whole vender/.../execute-all.sh section?
00:10:06 <strcat[m]> you don't need to make signing keys or do that part either
00:10:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> K has joined the Telegram Group!
00:10:22 <strcat[m]> HowardR: you don't do that, you only need that for doing a build to run on a Pixel
00:10:34 <strcat[m]> HowardR: vendor files aren't needed for generic / emulator builds
00:11:49 <strcat[m]> HowardR: it's basically just those 3 commands to build
00:12:02 <strcat[m]> that vendor section is for building for a Pixel
00:12:14 <strcat[m]> and you don't need to generate signing keys or sign builds with release.sh with them for a development build
00:12:24 <strcat[m]> and you don't need `m target-files-package` if you aren't doing a signed release from it
00:12:41 <strcat[m]> you just set up the environment, then choose the right target, then build with `m`, then run `emulator` to load it up in the emulator
00:12:58 <strcat[m]> then you can make changes, run `m` again in that shell (or a new one set up with envsetup + choosecombo again) to do an incremental build
00:13:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Hulk has joined the Telegram Group!
00:13:16 <HowardR> OK I'll try that and report back, thanks!!
00:13:25 <strcat[m]> if you want to start with a fresh build, remove `out`, and if you want a new build number / build date make a fresh shell

01:46:14 <gnome_giga_vegan> has anybody had luck replacing battery in a pixel3 (or any pixel really)?
01:47:26 <dannyknoll3[m]> gnome_giga_vegan: I babysit the tech at the store I trust to swap them. Inexpensive.
02:11:39 <akc3n[m]> <gnome_giga_vegan "has anybody had luck replacing b"> https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Google+Pixel+3+Battery+Replacement/124702
02:14:24 <gnome_giga_vegan> any old battery off amazon/ebay good enough?
02:14:47 <gnome_giga_vegan> any *new battery i mean, like not a specific brand or anything
02:15:34 <akc3n[m]> <gnome_giga_vegan "any old battery off amazon/ebay "> Old? Why is Gods name would you want to buy and old battery?
02:17:12 <dannyknoll3[m]> akc3n: "Any old" = "no specific kind" to look for
02:17:24 <akc3n[m]> * I don't know, I usually buy battery's from a local business
02:17:24 <akc3n[m]>   
02:17:24 <akc3n[m]> Also, check out #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:37:53 <skagreek[m]> From what I read here, it's OK to have google maps with network on all the time. I originally figured it's good to keep all the network and sensors off until I actually need to use the maps, but I heard that makes no sense.
03:38:17 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make much sense to temporarily turn Network off
03:38:32 <skagreek[m]> Got it.
03:39:01 <somenerd[m]> I believe that sensors can be temporarily turned off though
03:39:04 <strcat[m]> if you're worried about the app gathering data and sending it somewhere... it would just send the data later when network access is available, and apps already have to deal with network access not always being available
03:39:19 <strcat[m]> AOSP only permits sensor access for apps in the foreground by the way
03:39:20 <skagreek[m]> wow, good point.
03:39:30 <strcat[m]> so foreground service or foreground app
03:39:36 <hypokeimenon[m]> Google Maps on Graphene OS? Well, whatever floats your boat/suits your needs.
03:39:39 <strcat[m]> in order to use camera, microphone or sensors
03:39:50 <strcat[m]> they need permission and foreground
03:40:05 <skagreek[m]> didn't know about foreground, interesting.
03:40:28 <skagreek[m]> I try to force quit any apps out of paranoia too. lol
03:40:35 <Thatcher[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Google Maps on Graphene OS? Well"> I still use Rand McNally maps
03:41:07 <skagreek[m]> Thatcher: Hey, I still got my Thomas guide.
03:42:48 <asdf54> Can app icon badges be enabled. For instance unread messages on Signal icon?
03:52:54 <skagreek[m]> Curious what "Victor" is. Under Sensors, there are 5 instances of it. Reddit page mentions it's an icon pack. Thanks.
03:56:54 <skagreek[m]> Others with multiple instances named sam, rounded, kai, filled, etc. I guess it makes sense they are icons.
04:11:16 <k5L37> If I choose local for seedvault backup, where is the back up located? Can't seem to find it
04:12:09 <k5L37> Don't have usbc drive or nextcloud so I can only do local back up for now
04:12:23 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Press three dot, then click show hidden files
04:12:46 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Then you'd see the seedvault backup folder name which has a dot on the start
04:26:52 <k5L37> Ah got it tyvm.
04:33:00 <skagreek[m]> k5L37: This has been good with a microsd.
04:33:03 <skagreek[m]> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YGXR8N3
04:35:26 <k5L37> Hmm I ordered a usbc flash drive. Any reason to prefer one of the other?
04:35:53 <skagreek[m]> oh that works too. I had a bunch of microSD, so I figured I'd use them.
04:44:30 <sjsndnjdejd> <asdf54 "Can app icon badges be enabled. "> Think that's handled by the launcher you use
04:50:03 <k5L37> I feel stupid asking but how do I restore a seedvault backup? I don't see the option.
04:50:17 <k5L37> Didn't find much documentation on their github
04:54:47 <zzxx123_>  on setup wizard or via adb command
04:55:08 <skagreek[m]> The only method I noticed was restoring from the initial setup. Not sure if there are other ways.
04:55:20 <skagreek[m]>  * The only method I noticed was restoring from the initial setup screen. Not sure if there are other ways.
04:56:50 <k5L37> Hm ok. Also, is this backup tied to this physical phone? If I lost my phone, could I use this backup on a new phone?
04:57:27 <sjsndnjdejd> depends on where you back it up to ofc
04:57:39 <k5L37> Ok gotcha
05:08:25 <asdf54> Is there a recommended launcher that allows app icon badges? I need to glance at Signal Icon and see how many unread messages.
05:10:51 <asdf54> Is there a FOSS dialer with better logging? Need to see call time and duration without tapping screen.
05:17:58 <skagreek[m]> asdf54: I know other launchers are out of the norm for security, but this launcher called "Square Home" launcher has animated icons for notifications.
05:18:59 <skagreek[m]> So when there is a signal notification, it will show the actual texts/notification in the icon with a scroll. You can even make the icon 2x2 or whatever size you want.
05:24:26 <strcat[m]> asdf54: the built-in launcher has that
05:24:31 <strcat[m]> asdf54: you just have to enable it
05:24:47 <skagreek[m]> Good to know.
05:25:04 <strcat[m]> asdf54: long press home screen, press the notification dots option, enable it
05:25:17 <strcat[m]> we'd like to have that enabled by default, that's what I just said to dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro) is a good first issue for someone to work on
05:25:26 <strcat[m]> since they may just have to add a configuration file in /etc/
05:25:31 <strcat[m]> to set the default permissions
05:25:41 <skagreek[m]> Thanks
05:35:58 <asdf54> Thanks. I enabled Notification dots. I now get a blue dot but it doesn't say how many messages. I'm used to a red dot with a count of unread messages. Is that possible?
05:43:22 <strcat[m]> asdf54: it's not what the standard launcher implements
05:43:32 <strcat[m]> asdf54: long press on it to see the specific notifications
05:44:01 <strcat[m]> the notifications dots aren't really the traditional approach but rather people look at the actual notifications
05:44:08 <strcat[m]> and status bar
06:38:49 <chi00[m]> how do i get apps on my guest profile?
06:40:02 <chi00[m]> Or allow permission for the guest profile to install its own apps.
06:40:40 <mr_hebi_san[m]> You don't.  Guest doesn't have those abilities.  You would want to create a new User
06:42:22 <chi00[m]> wait wtf that option didnt appear before ...
06:42:30 <chi00[m]> but now it did.
06:43:04 <chi00[m]> was that a bug or am I dumb?
06:44:34 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Probably overlooked it.  I did that the first time I went to the multiple users screen
06:45:32 <chi00[m]> You don't use the owner profile as your daily driver?
06:46:12 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Nope
06:46:18 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I don't anyway
07:05:18 <pizzaeater69[m]> <chi00[m] "You don't use the owner profile "> For better security its better to use the owner profile just to manage other profiles
07:06:22 <chi00[m]> UGH i just realized i can save money on protonmail with an annual subscription >_<
07:07:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> River (@R‚ÄãiverOfWoe) has joined the Telegram Group!
07:07:09 <pizzaeater69[m]> Thats off topic but Protonmail thanks you for not knowing:D
07:08:09 <oa93v> Does multiple profiles affect battery life?
07:09:12 <chi00[m]> ^good question. I'm no expert but I'd say it does slightly
07:09:17 <pizzaeater69[m]> I dont have proof but based on my personal usage it does
07:09:21 <Lestat[m]> fuck man now im confused
07:09:52 <chi00[m]> The owner profile is always "active" so it makes sense
07:10:00 <Lestat[m]> At first i was rly confused, danny "cleared it up" and now that daniel posted that just now im completely lost
07:10:43 <Lestat[m]> im gonna go cry until i figure out what im supposed to do
07:22:14 <Lestat[m]> Do strcat you want notification dots to be enabled by default right?
07:22:45 <Lestat[m]> I think i understand what u want a lil better
07:26:57 <Lestat[m]> ill try working on it ig
07:29:24 <strcat[m]> yes
07:29:33 <strcat[m]> Lestat: look at what stock OS has in /etc
07:29:43 <Lestat[m]> hmm
07:29:45 <Lestat[m]> Okay
07:29:45 <strcat[m]> probably just need a default-permissions file
07:30:22 <strcat[m]> it is enabled by default but the launcher doesn't have the required permission by default
07:30:30 <strcat[m]> would fix a usability / support issue for us to resolve it
07:30:35 <Lestat[m]> Dont apps that come with aosp have priv apps allowlists or something like that
07:30:39 <strcat[m]> frequently people asking about it
07:30:43 <strcat[m]> it's not a privileged permission
07:30:51 <Lestat[m]> Hm
07:30:51 <Lestat[m]> okay
07:31:12 <strcat[m]> launcher isn't a priv-app and it's not a privileged permission
07:31:19 <Lestat[m]> Rly wish i knew aosp sourcecode even roughly here lol
07:31:31 <strcat[m]> I don't think any code change is needed
07:31:36 <strcat[m]> look into default-permissions
07:31:40 <strcat[m]> as a starting point
07:33:13 <Lestat[m]>  Yea i looked at the aosp page and sure enough its in /etc
07:33:15 <Lestat[m]> Ayt
07:33:35 <Lestat[m]> Will get started on studying once i can use my workstation
07:36:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> BTW
07:36:17 <Lestat[m]> So as i understand /etc/permissions is where im supposed to make changes?
07:36:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> I already looked into this
07:36:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> There are no default permission files on stock
07:36:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> /etc/default-permissions
07:37:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c‚Äãlannad> At least none related to the pixel launcher
07:37:06 <Lestat[m]> Okay
08:50:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw have a fix for the problem of people pretending to be others on the telegram side
08:51:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now if somebody has only a first name set and doesn't have a username a "!" is appended to their name at the beginning
08:51:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll deploy this later
08:54:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> This should also avoid confusion as it isn't possible to tag people by their first name on telegram
08:55:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since a "!" is not a valid character for a username you can be sure whether it's a first name or a username
08:55:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> I initially thought we could print the telegram ID but that's too spammy and kind of theater if you ask me
08:56:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> So if somebody joins with firstname set to clannad
08:56:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll show up as !clannad
08:59:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm still not sure if we should append IDs anyway
09:00:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> It sure makes moderation easier btw
09:00:16 <rny> why is taht an issue
09:00:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> rny: let's say my username is clannad
09:00:44 <rny> many people that use irc do not identify with nickserv
09:00:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> The bot is basically
09:00:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Return firstname if no username
09:01:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> So now somebody could set their first name to clannad and pretend to be me
09:01:37 <rny> plenty of strcats on freenode
09:01:38 <rny> LOL
09:01:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> To fix this, I append a character at the beginning that can never be part of a username
09:02:22 <rny> sounds good
09:02:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> K, you there?
09:03:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <U‚Äã_can_call_me_k> Hi I am K

11:43:55 <noustfurkuphater> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<KileXt> Proprietary != backdoor"> not always but proprietary= things we can't do stuff with so if it fucks up, it is on the proprietor to fix. Dependency on one entity to keep software secure when they tend to feel pressure from their governments and own company interests to exploit the user isn't a good thing. Software should be controlled by the community so proprietary is inherently a
11:43:55 <noustfurkuphater> security risk at the least and malware at most.
11:44:24 <noustfurkuphater> <pizzaeater69[m] "Non-free software isnt always ba"> depends on what you consider bad to be

13:06:57 <dazinism> noustfurkuphater: All smartphones have proprietary components. Hardware, Firmware and Software. Theres always parts that can't be fixed. There isn't currently a solution to this.
13:07:33 <dazinism> Despite what some phone projects may, kind of, suggest
13:07:46 <dazinism> Qualcomm, AOSP and Pixels do a pretty good job of isolating stuff.
13:10:39 <dazinism> Only other devices which may have higher levels of integrated security are iPhones
13:10:47 <dazinism> As far as I know
13:11:13 <noustfurkuphater> <dazinism "noustfurkuphater: All smartphone"> that is my point. That is why all phones are unsafe even the L5 as it still has proprietary baseband even though they have it run on another cpu.
13:11:39 <dazinism> Everything is unsafe
13:12:12 <dazinism> Arguably safety isn't black or white - but shades of grey
13:13:26 <dazinism> You'll likely find more info searching the logs
13:13:26 <noustfurkuphater> <dazinism "Only other devices which may hav"> but it's an iphone. Even if it had a free implementation of the security of their OS, I couldn't care because of how they have locked their device down. Iphones aren't good enough because apple's entire model is proprietary.
13:13:27 <dazinism> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
13:13:44 <noustfurkuphater> though they release a few free things
13:13:44 <dazinism> Or on the GrapheneOS reddit
13:13:50 <noustfurkuphater> <dazinism "Arguably safety isn't black or w"> yes
13:15:27 <noustfurkuphater> I mean mobile phone's literally have GPS. Can never really be trusted.
13:15:43 <noustfurkuphater> that's just scary
13:15:51 <lavonni[m]> can gps not be passive?
13:15:54 <dazinism> If you want a computing device with an opensource OS and good security, its a reasonable claim that you can't get better than the latest Pixels with GrapheneOS
13:15:57 <noustfurkuphater> we've just taken it to be normal
13:16:12 <noustfurkuphater> <lavonni[m] "can gps not be passive?"> not sure what that means. Explain please.
13:16:36 <noustfurkuphater> <dazinism "If you want a computing device w"> Idc for O/S. I want a freed one.
13:16:41 <dazinism> noustfurkuphater: pretty much all laptops have WiFi. Can locate a device by which WiFi network it sees.
13:16:43 <nscnt[m]> noustfurkuphater: You conclude that software that is proprietary is insecure. You're wrong. What you are doing is borderline concern trolling.
13:16:56 <noustfurkuphater> I don't just want a freed OS but a freed device entirely
13:17:00 <nscnt[m]> Most things are open source, but it doesn't help you
13:17:08 <nscnt[m]> It's signed
13:17:14 <nscnt[m]> and part of a root of trust

13:19:22 <noustfurkuphater> <lavonni[m] "can you not just have gps triang"> woah I'm not sure. I now think I do not understand much of the technology.
13:20:12 <noustfurkuphater> Oh well we still have the 3g,4g and worst the 5g and they are just a bit um no thanks
13:21:15 <dazinism> noustfurkuphater: all these concerns are well known. You aren't really adding anything new
13:21:44 <noustfurkuphater> I feel like I'm making myself move a bit more
13:21:51 <noustfurkuphater> I think I no longer want a mobile phone
13:21:57 <dazinism> GPS is passive. You don't transmit to the satellites, just recieve
13:22:38 <noustfurkuphater> well until at least a freed comes along
13:22:50 <dazinism> It will be a long time
13:23:05 <noustfurkuphater> guess I won't use one ever again then
13:23:13 <dazinism> Also pretty much the same for all.computers
13:23:27 <dazinism> Sadly
13:23:32 <noustfurkuphater> I will just have a burner for when I am required by organisations to give a phone number
13:23:54 <noustfurkuphater> <dazinism "Also pretty much the same for al"> Well some get pretty close like a libre thinkpad
13:24:12 <noustfurkuphater> powerpc computers seem interesting for desktop
13:25:44 <dazinism> Its a big problem to solve avoiding to have to trust the people who make your device/software. They are so complex. Guess ultimately hard to avoid having to trust anyone.
13:28:16 <dazinism> You can get a POWER PC, but then what software/firmware will you use? Can you really trust that?
13:28:39 <noustfurkuphater> exactly
13:28:44 <noustfurkuphater> an absolute constant battle
13:29:18 <noustfurkuphater> even when you get what you wanted, your hardware may become obsolete in just a few years for the tasks you require it to do.
13:29:36 <noustfurkuphater> as example, core 2 duo in a libre thinkpad
13:30:35 <noustfurkuphater> God I wish a genius like creators of TLS could just find a magic way to bypass things like ME and a magical, universal firmware for all secondary storage and just everything

14:29:03 <interesting[m]> somehow destroy it, or reset or something
14:29:14 <interesting[m]> so that pin is useless
14:29:22 <pizzaeater69[m]> There is not

14:57:48 <dakac> Can anyone tell me does Messenger, WhatsApp and Discord work on GrapheneOS?
14:59:54 <poisonoushydra[m> Yes, yes, and I have not tested it.
15:00:02 <asdf54> What is your interest in Graphene if not privacy?
15:00:16 <redman[m]> dakac: Jesus. Quite the privacy nightmare line-up, there. Yes, all (at minimum) have fully compatible webapps.
15:00:20 <redman[m]> asdf54: Security, probably.
15:01:41 <dakac> Yeah, I know, I found FOSS alternatives for all other apps, but my friends use these
15:02:20 <pizzaeater69[m]> I dont think Discord gets notifications tho because it needs googleplayservices
15:02:25 <redman[m]> dakac: Matrix bridges are pretty accessible to the individual now for those networks.
15:02:38 <redman[m]> <pizzaeater69[m] "I dont think Discord gets notifi"> Their webapp doesn't have desktop notifications?
15:02:45 <asdf54> My teenagers have persuaded all their friends to load Signal.
15:03:18 <dakac> I'm slowly getting mine to transition as well, but as you might imagine, people don't care all that much
15:04:55 <dakac> pizzaeater69[m] Yup, GrapheneOS doesn't have google play services on which a lot of these apps rely on. That's what got me wondering
15:06:31 <asdf54> Can you use them by the web without loading their app? A friend of mine found he can get notifications without the app by changing to the "not mobile" website.
15:08:12 <redman[m]> And/or installing the PWA to the homescreen
15:08:34 <dazinism> dannyknoll3 (Danny@WorkOrderPro): you were asking about advice for people interested in doing some Graphene development

15:21:45 <dazinism> asdf54: known trackers may be an issue, some stuff helps the developers fix apps. Up to you to decide.
15:21:45 <dazinism> Problem is apps can still do all the same 'tracking' without using a 3rd party tracking framework that would show up
15:22:00 <dazinism> Theres advice on selecting apps here https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
15:23:24 <dazinism> Should probably add a bit clarifying about trackers....

17:28:04 <redman[m]> ghkngfjkbgi: https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=Gcam&ch=grapheneos&w=a
18:44:43 <fybb> Quick question, isn't the path to otatools.zip at line 27 @ script/release.sh incorrect since the $OUT variable isn't used/declared anymore? Had to change it to "out/target/product/$1/otatools.zip" when creating a release earlier today
19:00:34 <Thatcher[m]> <kotaofshekels[m] "People who have bought the pixel"> I regret not paying an extra $349 for an additional 0.2" of screen size and other minor upgrades
19:03:23 <strcat[m]> fybb: no it's not incorrect
19:03:34 <strcat[m]> fybb: you're meant to run that in a shell with the environment set up properly, not a new shell
19:09:22 <asdf54> ghkngfjkbgi[m] I got PXv8.1_GCam-v1.2.apk working on grapheneos on Pixel4 after loading microG first. https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/f/changelog1526/ Also loaded google photos but photos crashes a lot. No problem with the camera so far. Good info here but I couldn't get the APK created by the "adb pull" command to work
19:09:22 <asdf54> after installing. The PX camera installed and works fine.
19:11:07 <asdf54> Open camera is a great option. Will use that if/when PX camera stops working.
19:12:37 <fybb> strcat[m]: ok, do you know where $OUT is set?
19:14:11 <j-james[m]> <asdf54 "ghkngfjkbgi I got PXv8.1_GCam-v1"> Also re: this, GCam only works up to a certain version depending on the Pixel model
19:14:46 <j-james[m]> Ex. on the 4a, only version 7.4 and under work
19:14:57 <strcat[m]> fybb: it's set as part of doing the build, you're supposed to use the same shell
19:15:12 <strcat[m]> if you don't use the same shell then it's your responsibility to set the variables it needs
19:16:02 <strcat[m]> asdf54: please don't recommend that people do broken stuff and install sketchy third party things, thanks
19:16:18 <fybb> strcat[m]: ok, thanks. I'll give it a shot tomorrow and try to see where I went wrong
19:17:44 <strcat[m]> asdf54: there are people who use the actual Google Camera on GrapheneOS, and while there's little assurance that will actually keep working (since it will likely depend more on Play services) they at least aren't running some weird old third party modified variant of it
19:21:44 <braxtono[m]> Is there a way for vanadium to mitigate these already? https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il/p/PP0
19:22:23 <braxtono[m]> CSS fingerprinting ,no JavaScript
19:24:34 <strcat[m]> braxtono: that's not about fingerprinting...
19:24:51 <strcat[m]> braxtono: and yes, Vanadium (and Chromium) has a sandbox with site isolation
19:25:27 <strcat[m]> braxtono: sites need to choose to set things up so that they are isolated well from other sites
19:26:42 <asdf54> ghkngfjkbgi[m] I'm not recommending PX GCam dated 2021-01-25. Just noting that it has worked for me. Also I'm not recommending microG just that I haven't experienced problems yet in about 2 weeks of testing and using as daily driver for 5 days.
19:26:43 <strcat[m]> https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-post-spectre-webdev/ is a guide for web site developers
19:26:49 <Lotus[m]1> are all applications sandboxed by default in android?
19:26:55 <Lotus[m]1> I may be wrong
19:27:03 <strcat[m]> they're always sandboxed
19:27:10 <strcat[m]> there is no option to have a non-sandboxed app
19:29:04 <dannyknoll3[m]> asdf54: Doesn't it bitch about you changing the OS, if microg has been smushed into the situation?
19:29:44 <strcat[m]> Google Camera doesn't care if you run it on another OS, they aren't using Google Camera though
19:29:48 <strcat[m]> they're using some third party fork
19:30:15 <strcat[m]> I suggest dropping the topic since I've made it clear that it's inappropriate to be encouraging doing broken things and using sketchy third party software
19:31:16 <strcat[m]>  * they're using some third party modified variant
19:35:27 <kotaofshekels[m]> <Thatcher[m] "I regret not paying an extra $34"> So basically seems like the pixel 5 only good point is the better contrast ratio and the better materials used to build the phone. I saw benchmarks showing they have the same performance.
19:37:11 * braxtono[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pfgINFbuwVkImVVygvuoMDgJ/message.txt >
19:40:10 <strcat[m]> braxtono: please read what I wrote in response already
19:40:20 <strcat[m]> braxtono: read the web browsing section on our site
19:40:32 <strcat[m]> Firefox and Tor do not have site isolation and cannot protect you much from side channel attacks
19:40:38 <strcat[m]>  * Firefox and Tor Browser do not have site isolation and cannot protect you much from side channel attacks
19:41:01 <strcat[m]> Chromium has site isolation, but as it will with any browser, it depends on sites setting themselves up to be isolated from others

19:41:43 <nscnt[m]> it's 404

19:48:02 <strcat[m]> nscnt: braxtono: it's still at https://github.com/mikewest/post-spectre-webdev
19:48:09 <strcat[m]> GitHub Pages version of it seems gone at the moment
19:48:12 <strcat[m]> being moved around
19:48:30 <strcat[m]> missed chance to see rendered version easily if you didn't already open what I linked earlier
19:48:34 <strcat[m]> until they set it up again
19:49:10 <strcat[m]> anyway point is that Chromium provides site isolation and web sites can be set up to provide really good isolation
19:49:56 <strcat[m]> Tor Browser tries to provide that kind of semantic isolation for everything but the issue is there isn't a foundation below those high level semantics to actually isolate them
19:50:16 <mynacol[m]> asdf54: You should not ping str_cat directly if not important
19:50:39 <mynacol[m]> asdf54: Takes time from him otherwise spent on development for the project

19:51:39 <strcat[m]> not entirely up-to-date
20:09:06 <wncry[m]> Hi everyone, is there a posibility to show notifications from other profiles (eg. system update notification from owner profile to user profile)?
20:12:28 <smctwo> Other way around I have seen, I think it is possible user is active
20:15:37 <wncry[m]> Ok, kinda bummer wanted to use user for day to day usage and owner as administrator of sorts, well thanks anyway.
20:19:26 <nscnt[m]> wncry: Is just the lack of the system update notifications the problem or what?
20:21:07 <wncry[m]> Well, also a sms notifications, for updates i could use atom feed
20:21:39 <nscnt[m]> wncry: SMS notifications work across users
20:23:12 <wncry[m]> <nscnt[m] "wncry: SMS notifications work ac"> Interesting, that would imply i did something wrong when setting up user account
20:24:14 <strcat[m]> wncry: you have to enable calls/texts
20:24:21 <strcat[m]> it's per-user configuration
20:24:56 <wncry[m]> Ok, I will give it a try.
20:28:32 <nscnt[m]> System update notifications are displayed by design only for the Owner user. This could be changed if we want to change the original design.
20:30:54 <wncry[m]> <nscnt[m] "System update notifications are "> Ok that doesn't bother me as much as absence of SMS notifications, i have tried to enable call/text access to user from owner but nothing...

21:36:57 <kotaofshekels[m]> In my country Pixel 5 is 630 euros VS Pixel 4a is 350 euros. What do I choose????
21:37:11 <kotaofshekels[m]> I know in your country it's $699 vs $350
21:37:44 <mynacol[m]> <kotaofshekels[m] "In my country Pixel 5 is 630 eur"> Both are fine
21:37:59 <kamesjitt616[m]> Depends what you need
21:39:41 <kotaofshekels[m]> I like that it feels good to use and smooth. Nice screen
21:39:46 <kotaofshekels[m]> I don't care about 5g
21:40:25 <kotaofshekels[m]> One time I bought a motorola moto G (3rd gen), and it SUCKED
21:40:31 <kotaofshekels[m]> So I'm scared to make the mistake again
21:40:39 <kotaofshekels[m]> To get a shitty phone
21:41:36 <b1101> I just like having a smaller sized phone. it's why whenever I upgrade from p3, it will probably be 5
21:44:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> 5g phones are futur proof
21:45:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> Pixel 5 has a big battery and 90hz screen and wireless charging
21:45:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K‚ÄãileXt> If you value these these things it might be worth it
21:58:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Federico has joined the Telegram Group!
22:09:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> You might also want to take a look at how long they will be supported.

22:12:19 <Duxy[m]> I currenty have everything setup in the owner profile. The only things I do are watching YouTube (Newpipe), listening podcasts (Antennapod), Browsing (Vanadium/Bromite), messaging (Whatsapp/Signal/Element) and sometime I use OsmAnd for navigation. And I got KeepassDX/Aegis. All my messengers don't have permission for storage but just network and contacts. Would using a separate user profile make sense? All apps are
22:12:19 <Duxy[m]> sandboxed anyway so whatsapp doesn't have access to any other app. I feel like it won't add anything or am musunderstanding stuff?
22:12:41 <Duxy[m]> And calling sometimes ofc

22:15:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> A second profile is useful e.g.in case you want to use the phone in one, but keep more private data at rest in the other profile.
22:16:16 <Duxy[m]> So for storing private files?
22:18:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> To protect them in a scenario the unlocked phone (because you used it for a phone call) gets into the wrong hands (e.g.robber). Data in the still locked second profile would be protected.
22:19:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> I do not use the main account for anything.
22:21:09 <Duxy[m]> I don't store any private files on my phone so I guess it's irrelevant for me
22:21:40 <Duxy[m]> Thanks
22:23:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> How about exposing your private messages? And getting access to your keepass-file for brute-forcing on another device?
22:23:04 <visla[m]> I've been checking out the "Mass Extraction" report from Upturn - is GrapheneOS resistant to mobile device forensic tools (MDFTs) used by police departments?
22:23:12 <Duxy[m]> Is WiFi calling preferred over cellular btw?
22:24:18 <Duxy[m]> My private messages only contain "the dog has been out this late" and making appointments
22:24:49 <Duxy[m]> And my keepass doesn't contain anything important
22:24:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> For secure calls the experts here say not to use cellular.
22:25:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> ...but signal etc.
22:25:34 <Duxy[m]> Tell that to all the organisations
22:27:23 <snoopy> all my files on my phone are private :x?
22:27:47 <bushido-bol[m]> Just got my Pixel 5 in the mail, boutta load it up with a fresh install
22:28:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption explains that way better than I could.
22:28:37 <Duxy[m]> Nice, I'm gonna wait for 3A EOL before buying a new phone.
22:28:46 <visla[m]> GrapheneOS-Teleg: was that in response to me or snoopy ?
22:29:34 <bushido-bol[m]> Duxy: I just managed to run over my 3xl last week so it was a bummer
22:33:58 <b1101> if I I have two wap's in my apt. should the phone switch to the strongest signal automatically?
22:34:11 <strcat[m]> yes
22:34:20 <strcat[m]> it will choose the better one
22:34:32 <strcat[m]> may not be the one with a stronger signal if the weaker one is good enough and faster
22:36:09 <Duxy[m]> bushido-bol: ouch
22:47:05 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: The value of these UFED devices are greatly overstated. Much of the time, they are simply a way to extract files from devices that have already been unlocked. Essentially, they are a glorified way of using ADB. Some of them simply offer prepackaged exploits to unlock devices that are known to be vulnerable or have for any reason, been powered on with the disk unlocked, but are on the
22:47:07 <TheJollyRoger> lockscreen.
22:48:31 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: So, in a nutshell, they offer ways to extract images for phones *that you have the password for*, or a way to unlock outdated phones via prepackaged exploits. They aren't as big an issue as they would like you to believe them to be, and if you use a secondary profile and use GrapheneOS' "end session" button when you no longer need the keys to be in memory, they're not a problem at
22:48:33 <TheJollyRoger> all.
22:50:19 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: in short, UFED machines are a bikeshed discussion and you don't need to worry about it so long as you stay up to date, or, if you do believe yourself to be the target of one, use what we recommend by only using the owner profile to power on and manage other user profiles, which allows the user profiles to be locked and the keys ejected from memory when not in use, coupled with a
22:50:21 <TheJollyRoger> strong password. (GrapheneOS allows passphrases of up to 64 characters in length).
22:50:41 <visla[m]> TheJollyRoger: Thanks for the reply. My Pixel is in the mail and should arrive Thursday or Friday. I'm not educated on the secondary profile or end session button yet.
22:51:21 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: Great, well, I'll just tell you in advance then. Under "Settings" you will find options for multiple users.
22:51:52 <TheJollyRoger> I believe under Settings -> System -> Multiple Users.
22:52:12 <TheJollyRoger> The owner profile has several important system configuration settings encrypted, so as a result the Owner profile MUST be unlocked to finish powering on the phone.
22:52:41 <visla[m]> If I'm hearing you right, it's the same idea s not operating Linux as root?
22:52:44 <TheJollyRoger> But you can add multiple profiles. These provide separate workspaces,
22:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: It's very similar. Except even on the owner profile, apps are always FULLY SANDBOXED as strongly as possible.
22:53:39 <TheJollyRoger> Apps are *always* sandboxed on Android, and GrapheneOS seeks to strengthen the sandboxing and mitigate exploits.
22:54:05 <TheJollyRoger> However, the profiles go a bit further than this: each one allows a separate contextual workspace to be provided.
22:54:22 <visla[m]> Like Linux virtual desktops?
22:54:40 <TheJollyRoger> Not quite. The profiles will have their own contact list and its own calendar, and its own app, essentially,
22:55:01 <visla[m]> Oh that's very interesting
22:55:03 <TheJollyRoger> it's like having multiple phones compressed into one, which can OPTIONALLY be made to share the same wireless service provider.
22:55:26 <TheJollyRoger> Their own application data, their own app storage, their own shared storage partition...
22:55:37 <TheJollyRoger> Essentially, the profiles have nothing to do with each other, except for one thing:
22:55:46 <strcat[m]> visla: nothing to do with 'virtual desktops'
22:56:27 <strcat[m]> user profiles are separate user accounts with their own lock method, their own encryption keys (disk encryption is per-profile), etc.
22:56:27 <TheJollyRoger> App installations are global, but each profile will appear to have its own copy of that app, and its own separate app data.
22:56:30 <visla[m]> If a profile isn't provided permissions to share the wireless service provider and that profile is active, is it then cut off from being physically tracked via cell towers?
22:56:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> Don't they all use the network of the currently active profile?
22:56:36 <TheJollyRoger> The only catch is, the app *MUST* be the same version.
22:56:48 <strcat[m]> visla: you seem quite confused
22:56:51 <strcat[m]> visla: that doesn't make sense
22:57:06 <strcat[m]> visla: I suggest reading the FAQ
22:57:13 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: only Airplane mode can prevent you from being tracked via the cell towers.
22:57:17 <strcat[m]> required reading before posting questions here, really
22:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> Point, yes, read the FAQ.
22:57:59 <visla[m]> I've read some of it, but obviously not the parts that answer some of my questions.
22:58:04 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: With respect to "being tracked by cell towers" I would like to offer you a simple experiment. Write a letter to your sweetheart, put it in an envelope, put a stamp on the envelope without a return address and without a destination address and see if it arrives.
22:58:07 <visla[m]> TheJollyRoger:
22:58:19 <visla[m]> TheJollyRoger: Thanks for all of the insight!
22:58:22 <TheJollyRoger> Your cellphone service provider *needs* to know which towers to route to.
22:58:41 <TheJollyRoger> If it doesn't know which towers to route to so it can connect to your device, how is it going to deliver you connectivity?
22:59:17 <Duxy[m]> would it be possible/a good idea to force/recommend using a separate user profile when installing GrapheneOS? It's a long time since I installed it btw so maybe it actually does.
22:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: no, it would not, because some people have no need to make use of different contextual identities.
23:00:26 <visla[m]> I see your point. My threat model is very small so far as I'm aware and these are issues that I hopefully won't run in to, but I'm curious none the less. I know very little about cellular networking.
23:01:23 <Duxy[m]> TheJollyRoger: but you could make an info screen recommending it for the users that do need it right?
23:01:44 <Duxy[m]> * TheJollyRoger: but you could make an info screen at install recommending it for the users that do need it right?
23:02:01 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: The recommendation is in the FAQ. Multiple users can be found in the settings, or by tapping on the icon in the corner of the pulldown menu.
23:02:26 <TheJollyRoger> But if you'd like to add it to the launcher, you're welcome to, if you have a goal and threat model in mind.
23:04:37 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: There's nothing nefarious about the cell network. It's transport agnostic, but these days over 95% of the internet is TLS encrypted anyways. Rather than rely on network level authentication, which would entail TRUSTING THE NETWORK, modern web traffic relies on the transport layer itself being secure.
23:04:40 <Duxy[m]> TheJollyRoger: I know they are in there but I figured it might be a nice addition. I'm not a developer so xD
23:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> That's why it's not a big problem for the cellular network to be security-agnostic.
23:05:04 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: Hehe, I gotcha!
23:05:34 <TheJollyRoger> Because it's better that the network be security agnostic, and easier to make the *applications* and the traffic that your applications send internally secure, than to trust the network.
23:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> Essentially, the cellular network is no more nefarious than any other way to connect to the internet.
23:07:38 <visla[m]> TheJollyRoger: I think I get what you're saying
23:07:54 <TheJollyRoger> Your cellphone service provider has a legitimate need to be able to route traffic to your cellphone, just as your home internet service provider needs to know which house they have to run the wire into.
23:08:02 <TheJollyRoger> As well as if you've paid your bills that month.
23:09:21 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: yep, hope this makes sense. There's a lot of misunderstanding about this sort of thing.
23:09:24 <TheJollyRoger> I will be back shortly.
23:10:21 <asdf5465> Any recommendations about using face unlock?
23:10:51 <visla[m]> My initial concern was whether a cop could pull me over for speeding and then plug a device into my locked device and crack/decrypt my data, but it sounds like that's not the case.
23:11:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Fingerprint unlock + incredibly long passphrase is a better approach IMO.
23:11:59 <asdf5465> Thanks but pixel 4 has no fingerprint unlock
23:12:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Sometimes depends on your threat model.
23:12:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Whoops.
23:14:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> For an easy unlock method, face unlock then. But I think that should go along with a really long passphrase.
23:15:01 <visla[m]> This might not be the right room for this, but is anyone aware of the actual password and decryption cracking ability of LEOs? Articles I've read make it sound like mobile devices are easier to break into than other encrypted devices but I don't know why that would be.
23:15:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> You could use the off-topic chat.
23:17:07 <skwisgaar[m]> asdf5465: face unlock is actually more secure than fingerprint, so you don‚Äôt need to be concerned about using it. Whether you use a long passphrase or not depends on whether you want to rely on the Titan M chip to protect against someone trying to guess your password.
23:17:28 <skwisgaar[m]> That depends on your threat model
23:17:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Wow. I thought they were just as safe.
23:18:34 <skwisgaar[m]> It‚Äôs not that the pixel fingerprint sensor is insecure, just that it‚Äôs less secure than face unlock.
23:18:51 <skwisgaar[m]> Probably not a significant difference to most users
23:19:32 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <skwisgaar[m] "It‚Äôs not that the pixel fingerpr"> Doesn't that apply only to face unlock like the one in Pixel 4?
23:20:31 <skwisgaar[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: I am comparing the pixel implementations only
23:21:00 <skwisgaar[m]> I would imagine that some other phones have poorly implemented face unlock where a pixel fingerprint sensor would be preferable
23:21:11 <skwisgaar[m]> But I don‚Äôt know for sure
23:21:34 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <skwisgaar[m] "SkyFox [kde.org]: I am comparing"> But  that's what I mean. On a Pixel 4a a fingerprint would be more secure than face unlock, afaik
23:22:20 <skwisgaar[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: is the face unlock technology different between pixels? I wasn‚Äôt aware of that
23:22:35 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <skwisgaar[m] "SkyFox [kde.org]: is the face un"> Yes
23:22:41 <duck[m]1> 3d ir unlock > fingerprint
23:23:02 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <duck[m]1 "3d ir unlock > fingerprint"> But other Pixels don't have that
23:23:09 <skwisgaar[m]> Ok then that‚Äôs worth looking into, I‚Äôm not sure
23:23:12 <duck[m]1> dropped because of covid
23:23:20 <Duxy[m]> Oh shit, I think I finally understand the profile/end session thing..... If I use a seperate user profile and tap the end session button that profile will be encrypted again while I'm still able to be called right? While if I just use the owner profile data will still be decrypted if I lock the phone again??
23:23:34 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "But other Pixels don't have that"> Only Pixel 4 (XL). That's what their top bezel is for
23:23:42 <strcat[m]> Duxy: if a profile isn't logged in, then the data is at rest, OS cannot decrypt the data
23:23:48 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: Yes, it's definitely not the case. He'd need to know your password(s) first, or you would need to be using a device that has a known vulnerability to a prepackaged exploit.
23:23:54 <strcat[m]> Duxy: end session puts it back at rest
23:24:00 <strcat[m]> Duxy: the data on storage is never decrypted
23:24:16 <Duxy[m]> strcat: thats genius lol
23:24:17 <strcat[m]> it's about whether the OS has the keys to decrypt data from it
23:24:21 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: yes, that's it. If you hit that gray "End Session" button, the phone will eject the cryptographic keys from its memory and the data will be put at rest. It cannot be decrypted without the password.
23:24:30 <strcat[m]> Duxy: recommend https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption to learn about this
23:25:28 <TheJollyRoger> asdf5465: There is no concern with face unlock. The phone doesn't store your face. The secure element can check via "fuzzy hashing" if it matches what came before, but your phone does not store nor transmit your face.
23:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> asdf5465: By design, it will not work if you are wearing a mask over your nose and mouth, or if your eyes are shut.
23:27:08 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: are you aware of the security differences between 4a and 4 face unlock methods?
23:27:11 <jay46> strcat: hi... I can't figure out why just regular SMS messages are not making a notification sound for new messages. It will vibrate but not make the new message notification sound. Any ideas... ?
23:27:12 <TheJollyRoger> asdf5465: if you are still worried about accidentally unlocking your phone, you can enable lockdown, and then tap "lockdown." This will switch the biometric sensors off and require the pincode to unlock the phone again.
23:27:47 <strcat[m]> jay46: sounds like you don't have making a sound enabled
23:27:47 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: Well, I do know that I can unlock my phone by nudging it, if it's tilted toward my face.
23:28:12 <duck[m]1> ir based face unlock is great tech
23:28:18 <TheJollyRoger> The phone must be within around roughly two, to roughly two and a half feet for this to work.
23:28:23 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise it's out of range or is too close.
23:28:40 <strcat[m]> jay46: or your sound is just off
23:28:57 <jay46> strcat: shouldnt be a tough thing but i can go to that app, notifications are on, sounds are on for ringing etc.
23:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: as for password cracking on the Pixels, please read the FAQ on encryption.
23:29:31 <jay46> just nothing for incoming texts.
23:29:37 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: on the Pixel 3s and later, to completely exhaust the key space for even a weak four-digit password would take over 650 years.
23:29:49 <skwisgaar[m]> I was more curious if the technology behind the face unlock on the 4 is more sophisticated or difficult to bypass than the 4a.
23:29:59 <duck[m]1> 4 is much better
23:30:03 <strcat[m]> 4a doesn't have face unlock
23:30:08 <TheJollyRoger> visla[m]: Please read the FAQ on encryption, the Pixels have a very sophisticated hardware-bound keying system and security chip.
23:30:40 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: I don't think there's much difference? It's biometrics, so it's done via fuzzy hashing in the secure element, but the password is required to unlock the keys.
23:30:45 <TheJollyRoger> I could be wrong though.
23:30:51 <visla[m]> <TheJollyRoger "visla: Please read the FAQ on en"> Thank you, I'm reading about it now
23:30:53 <duck[m]1> hardware is different
23:30:56 <skwisgaar[m]> Lmao of course
23:31:09 <duck[m]1> pixel 4 does ir dot projection
23:31:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <X> Where would I find this?
23:31:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Does GOS' multiusers function allow for hiding the device's UUID, serial number and the SIM phone number? AFAIK Android apps can not see the IMEI.
23:31:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> We recommend users get the latest devices we support for the best security and privacy
23:31:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, the Pixel 4 will fire a short lived, but intense burst of infrared light from two scanners mounted near the earpiece of your phone.
23:32:04 <Duxy[m]> strcat: I actually read the FAQ again this afternoon but somehow I either accidentally skipped that part or it just didn't correctly register. Sorry
23:32:08 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - Android *itself* hides the Device's UUID, serial number, SIM, and IMEI.
23:32:13 <duck[m]1> does 4a do face unlock at all
23:32:22 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - please read the FAQ on non-resettable hardware identifiers.
23:32:25 <skwisgaar[m]> Why are people telling me about security differences in face unlock when 4a doesnt even have it lol
23:32:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 5 currently has the strongest encryption
23:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> duck[m]1: The 4a does NOT RPT NOT allow for face unlock. That feature is only found on 4, and 4XL.
23:33:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is also harder to steal the encryption keys off the pixel 5 even when AFU
23:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles: https://grapheneos.org/faq#non-hardware-identifiers please read this with respect to hardware identifiers.
23:33:32 <TheJollyRoger> Apps CANNOT access hardware identifiers.
23:34:12 <TheJollyRoger> ONLY NON-USER FACING SYSTEM UTILITIES that are ISOLATED and SANDBOXED and are ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED TO CONNECT have access to non-resettable hardware identifiers.
23:34:46 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles: https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers Sorry, this one.
23:35:20 <strcat[m]> apps cannot see the phone number without you explicitly giving them it
23:35:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> The wrappedkey_v0 flag enables the use of hardware-wrapped keys. When enabled, FBE keys are not generated by software, but rather are generated by Keymaster using the STORAGE_KEY tag. Then, each FBE key actually provided to the kernel is the STORAGE_KEY key exported from Keymaster, which causes it to be wrapped with a per-boot ephemeral key. The kernel then provides the wrapped keys directly to the inline
23:35:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> encryption hardware. When implemented correctly, the unwrapped keys are never present in system memory, and a compromised wrapped key cannot be used after a reboot. This flag requires hardware support, Keymaster support for STORAGE_KEY, kernel driver support, the inlinecrypt mount option, and either the inlinecrypt_optimized or emmc_optimized flags.
23:35:44 <strcat[m]> if you explicitly give them Phone information then yes they have the phone number because you explicitly gave it to them
23:35:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 5 has support ¬∞
23:35:50 <strcat[m]> but there is no way for apps to obtain hardware identifiers
23:35:55 <Duxy[m]> Now that I wanna setup a user profile. Should I just factory reset the phone and then setup the second profile or is deleting all the apps in the owner profile and setting up the second profile acceptable as well?
23:35:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Pixel 5 has support ^
23:35:57 <strcat[m]> covered well in FAQ
23:36:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://source.android.com/security/encryption/file-based
23:36:40 <strcat[m]> Duxy: the only reason to factory reset would be to guarantee that in the future, past data stored in the owner profile couldn't be recovered when it's unlocked
23:37:00 <strcat[m]> depends if you really want that kind of guarantee
23:37:26 <strcat[m]> the data will largely be overwritten in the NAND over time after deleting it but there is no guarantee without deleting the profile
23:37:35 <strcat[m]> and for owner profile deleting it requires a factory reset since it's the system profile
23:37:44 <strcat[m]> part of why we recommend taking advantage of user profiles
23:37:46 <Duxy[m]> strcat: okay thanks might as well do it.
23:37:57 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the wrappedkey stuff is not really that useful in practice
23:38:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: weird question, blkdiscard -s supported? (Or even meaningful)
23:38:08 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it closes a feature gap with iOS but really isn't that useful
23:38:14 <Duxy[m]> Is allow phone/sms to the user profile recommended or?
23:38:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not very meaningful
23:38:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Got it
23:38:32 <Duxy[m]> * Is allowing phone/sms to the user profile recommended or?
23:38:48 <strcat[m]> Duxy: if you're going to be using as your regular profile, and need those to work, ofc
23:38:58 <strcat[m]> we recommend avoiding carrier-based texts and calls whenever possible though
23:39:19 <strcat[m]> use secure texts/calls
23:39:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just read the documentation that unlocking the bootloader on the pixel triggers a secure erase
23:39:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Was curious why that's all
23:40:06 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it doesn't do a secure erase, it securely deletes the material needed to derive the keys ever again
23:40:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: encryption avoids reliance on SSD secure erase
23:40:32 <strcat[m]> secure erase can't erase something it can't access anymore
23:40:58 <Duxy[m]> strcat: well some sites still only offer SMS 2fa and I do occasionally get calls. If that won't work without giving it access then I will have to yes.
23:41:04 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: a lot of desktop SSDs just always have their own internal encryption on
23:41:19 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and they do 'secure erase' for the drive as a whole by just wiping the key
23:41:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: AFAIK that's just theater, no?
23:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh god.
23:41:38 <strcat[m]> sure because they always have the key
23:41:44 <strcat[m]> but it works for secure erase
23:41:49 <strcat[m]> that part isn't
23:41:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have read reports that they didn't implement this correctly
23:41:50 <TheJollyRoger> I'm getting flashbacks to the time I attempted to use hdparm.
23:41:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: as I said above
23:42:01 <strcat[m]> this feature isn't needed
23:42:04 <strcat[m]> because of encryption
23:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> they don't call the flag "--please-destroy-my-drive" please destroy my drive for nothing.
23:42:19 <strcat[m]> it's not how profiles or the device as a whole are securely deleted
23:42:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "they don't call the flag "--plea"> What
23:42:36 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: I accidentally bricked an SSD once using hdparm by not knowing what I was doing.
23:43:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g‚Äãochoingles> Hoo! That flag seems scary.
23:43:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's pretty messed up yo
23:43:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's only intended to be used for testing, I was being a toxic self-defeating poweruser and I thought I knew everything.
23:43:35 <TheJollyRoger> It was a lesson I had to learn.
23:43:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> We've all been there
23:44:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> I was once the dumb guy who shipped linux-libre for security reasons in glassrom only realizing how stupid it was later
23:45:14 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yipes. Glad you moved off that o.O!
23:45:17 <Duxy[m]> I used to dd my SSDs, now they're all broken lol. I knew I shouldn't have done it but I was naive haha
23:46:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Oh yipes. Glad you moved off tha"> I was pretty much just scammed by the floss community into thinking it was secure
23:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> Duxy[m]: ohhhh crap, yeah very hard on the SSD!
23:46:24 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: crap, that was me too, a few years ago :(
23:48:39 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - yeah, hdparm allows you to speak directly to the PATA/SATA/SAS interface in the kernel... but it's VERY dangerous to do that, even if you know exactly what you are doing. You can cause permanent, irreversible damage to the hard disk, sometimes even if you succeed in what you are trying to do.
23:50:02 <Rudd-O[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I was once the dumb guy who ship"> Why was that bad?
23:50:29 <TheJollyRoger> Rudd-O[m]: it means you've essentially made your computer vulnerable to any hardware/firmware exploits.
23:51:32 <TheJollyRoger> Because now you've rolled back any and all firmware/microcode mitigations and you've returned them to a state where they are known to be vulnerable.
23:52:08 <TheJollyRoger> Rudd-O[m]: it's essentially the equivalent of turning off security updates, for your hardware.
23:53:56 <Rudd-O[m]> Oops.
23:54:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
23:54:19 <Rudd-O[m]> Roger that.
23:58:43 <pinkylittlecat[m> read the man pages, it has "dont use this command, its dangerous!"
