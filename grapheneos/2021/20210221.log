00:00:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy harrisonford[m], you've come to the right place.
00:00:54 <TheJollyRoger> Could you tell us what you see and try to tell us what you did?
00:01:08 <TheJollyRoger> When you turn on the phone, does it show any signs of life at all?
00:01:39 <TheJollyRoger> Do you get to the screen that says "No valid slot" and displays some information and allow you to switch between "start, bar codes, recovery, rescue" with your volume keys?
00:03:46 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: could you tell us what you did? Did you follow any instructions that didn't come from grapheneos.org?
00:03:56 <harrisonford[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Could you tell us what you see a"> OK, right now it is still alive. im stuck in a boot loop in fastboot mode. it is currently unlocked.
00:04:32 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: Ok, good, you're still alright. Under "reason" do you see any information listed there, like "no valid slot" or something?
00:04:48 <TheJollyRoger> Could you tell us what steps you took to arrive here, in as much detail as you can?
00:04:52 <TheJollyRoger> Did you attempt a commandline installation?
00:05:12 <TheJollyRoger> Did you follow any instructions that didn't come from grapheneos.org?
00:05:54 <harrisonford[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Could you tell us what you see a"> commandline install attempted. followed site instructions and supplimented with Techlore and The Hated one to get video idea od what the grapene site was saying.
00:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: your phone is not perma-bricked, it just means the OS won't boot. This is easily correctable.
00:06:10 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: If you follow Techlore's guide, best case scenario, is this.
00:06:11 <harrisonford[m]> reason here listed: reboot bootloader
00:06:31 <zvl12[m]> Updated nicely to last release on 4a5G .... still no text messages ringing on second profile ... would appreciate if someone on 4a5G could create a second profile as well and test if it rings or only vibrates ...thanks
00:06:55 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: If you follow techlore's guide, best case scenario, you install a third party version of fastboot, it fails autodetection, corrupts your OS and renders the phone unbootable.
00:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: worst case scenario, you end up with an expensive paperweight.
00:07:21 <harrisonford[m]> <TheJollyRoger "harrisonford: If you follow tech"> yeah...yikes
00:07:23 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: your best bet is to use the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web and start from the beginning.
00:07:30 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: you got lucky this time.
00:08:09 <harrisonford[m]> ok, i'll go see if i can use that. phone doesn't seem to be connecting to my computer for some reason...
00:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: the 4a5G lacks some checks on its bootloader which prevent incorrect images from being flashed to the phone. You could very well be looking at a $500 paperweight at this moment.
00:08:44 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: As before: your safest bet is to use the web installer at https://grapheneos.org/install/web - please follow the directions there, switch it on to fastboot, unlock, and flash using the directions on the web installer.
00:09:20 <harrisonford[m]> <TheJollyRoger "harrisonford: As before: your sa"> ok, ill go see if i can get that running and let you know. thanks
00:10:18 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: Please don't follow the techlore guides or any third party guides. They result in bricked devices but the youtubers have refused to take down inaccurate and misleading and unsafe directions. The web installer will serve you well; it should not be used in incognito mode or it will fail, please use Edge, or Chromium which implement webusb.
00:11:04 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: read everything there on the web installer before you begin.
00:12:10 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: if the flashing hangs even though you can use the web installer to lock and unlock the bootloader, what typically causes that is your motherboard's USB firmware not supporting all the features of USB that fastboot needs (or your cable not being fully wired).
00:13:49 <TheJollyRoger> To anyone subscribing to beta release: beta images have been pushed and are now in the wild. Anyone in the beta channel, now's the time to test and submit reports. Use your phone and see if anything is broken that hasn't been broken before.
00:16:52 <jardin57> My Pixel 3a is on beta now
00:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> jardin57: Great!
00:17:06 <jardin57> However, I don't really know what to look out for
00:17:43 <TheJollyRoger> jardin57: Well, the easiest thing to do, is to just use your phone as much as you can for two hours for things you would use your phone for.
00:17:50 <TheJollyRoger> Chat, take pictures, listen to movies, watch music,
00:18:00 <TheJollyRoger> browse the internet, download stuff, install apps...
00:18:06 <TheJollyRoger> switch between profiles...
00:18:27 <TheJollyRoger> If you find something that's broken that hasn't been broken before, then the best thing to do, is to file an issue.
00:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't, then what I like to do...
00:18:45 <jardin57> Can I just create an account on the issue tracker?
00:19:01 <TheJollyRoger> https://gist.github.com/Peter-Easton/7046760bdeccb522839c4755824160ba I like to post a report on my gist.github and say "this is what I've tested, this is what works (or doesn't).
00:19:09 <TheJollyRoger> jardin57: yep.
00:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, hmm, what if I was to post something there.
00:20:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec.
00:21:05 <jardin57> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues this is the main issue tracker?
00:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. jardin57, one sec and I'll start a topic there.
00:22:15 <jardin57> Can I also comment on other suggestions? For example, I hate active edge stuff :P
00:22:45 <jardin57> (I won't overdo it)
00:23:41 <TheJollyRoger> You certainly can!
00:24:20 <damienrg[m]> Is there a way to not have the warning: "You are loading a different version…" at boot?
00:24:24 <jardin57> Ok, great!
00:24:25 <TheJollyRoger> Here. Anybody who's testing devices, if you don't find any bugs, can you let us know "She's good" and tell us what device you're testing, when, and let us know? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/460
00:25:30 <TheJollyRoger> damienrg[m]: That warning is printed from the bootloader. It's a very important device security feature, it cannot be disabled. In theory, if we produced our own handsets, we would key the bootloader accordingly so it wouldn't.
00:25:34 <TheJollyRoger> But that's if we had our own.
00:25:57 <jardin57> Btw, I noticed something else. Orbot is now able to handle captive portals in full-device VPN-mode. Which is very good for people who frequently use public WiFis. It wasn't working a couple months ago (couldn't load the captive portal site). Is that something Graphene changed or an improvement in Orbot?
00:27:20 <jardin57> It's brilliant, I consider the combination of GrapheneOS + full MAC randomization + Orbot + captive portal compatibility a gift from heaven
00:28:36 <TheJollyRoger> Anyone else who would like reminders on when to send in beta reports, please join #grapheneos-beta, it's used for pinging reminders of when the beta has been pushed and to remind you to send in the reports.
00:28:53 <harrisonford[m]> <TheJollyRoger "harrisonford: if the flashing ha"> ok, hit a snag... got to point of "flashing factory images" on the web-install. during device restart an ugly screen pops up on the phone "fastbootd" offering to reboot system now, reboot to bootloader, enter recovery or power off and website says "Unable to Claim Interface"... 😬😬😬
00:28:56 <TheJollyRoger> jardin57: I can't say for certain about orbot, but I'm glad to hear you're finding it's working for you!
00:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: leave the phone be while it's in fastbootd - don't disturb it.
00:29:54 <patlastname[m]> Has anyone had any luck getting push motifs working for protonmail?
00:30:26 <TheJollyRoger> patlastname[m]: Protonmail's push notifications require Google Play to use push notifications. GrapheneOS does not bundle Play Services.
00:30:42 <damienrg[m]> <harrisonford[m] "ok, hit a snag... got to point o"> Are you using a USB-C?
00:31:25 <patlastname[m]> Is there no workaround? Not getting push motifs seems like a pretty big hit for daily usability
00:31:26 <jardin57> harrisonford[m] I ran into the same issue yesterday. Web install wasn't working, same issue you encountered. It was working before, so this is a setback
00:31:28 <harrisonford[m]> <damienrg[m] "Are you using a USB-C?"> not sure. the computer is low end and 2 or 3 years old. is there a way to check?
00:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> harrisonford[m]: usually a lot of these issues are caused by substandard cables or motherboard firmware that doesn't implement the full featureset required by fastboot... switching cables or switching ports may fix it.
00:32:04 <jardin57> TheJollyRoger I had the same issue yesterday, I'm confident there's something wrong with the web installer. It was working before
00:32:08 <TheJollyRoger> patlastname[m]: This is because Protonmail has elected to use push notifications through Google for their app. Your best bet to get it solved is to contact Protonmail themselves and ask them to write their app so it's not dependent on play services for push notifications.
00:32:52 <patlastname[m]> Ah, oki thank you for explaining, have a great day! :D
00:32:56 <damienrg[m]> <harrisonford[m] "not sure. the computer is low en"> Which phone do you use and is the port on the PC the same as on the phone?
00:33:09 <TheJollyRoger> patlastname[m]: Yep, anytime!
00:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> jardin57: Ok! Let's sit tight for a bit, I'm not that well versed on the web-installer, unfortunately.
00:33:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that :(
00:33:59 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta close up, I'll be back shortly.
00:34:11 <jardin57> TheJollyRoger It's ok, I thought it was a one-off error and then I switched to the CLI installation. But now that someone else mentioned the exact same error, there's a pattern
00:34:36 <jardin57> After a reboot, the phone doesn't get "detected" by the web installer anymore and an error message appears. It was working before.
00:34:58 <harrisonford[m]> <damienrg[m] "Which phone do you use and is th"> its a pixel 4a5G. the phone came with a usb-c on both ends cord, b ut my computer needs a standard looking USB, so im using a samsung factory cord (it's the best ive got since i dont have a usb-c to normal usb adapter...
00:35:24 <TheJollyRoger> jardin57: I see, huh.
00:36:37 <TheJollyRoger> We could try the CLI install in his case but I *need* to get off the computer and can't do a walk through at the moment. harrisonford[m], if you decide to pursue that route, you will need to first remove any and all traces of any third-party fastboot or platform tools you installed and revert any changes you made to the system prior to when you installed any sort of third-party fastboot.
00:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise you can brick.
00:36:43 <damienrg[m]> <harrisonford[m] "its a pixel 4a5G. the phone came"> Its USB-A on your PC then. Try on another USB port of your PC and if it does not work try with another USB cable.
00:36:53 <TheJollyRoger> I have to go, sorry. I will return later.
00:37:14 <jardin57> I won't be able to do much more tonight (it's 01:36 over here) but I see there's room for improvement, so I will likely create an issue tomorrow
00:40:54 <harrisonford[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I have to go, sorry. I will retu"> that sounds a bit over my pay grade. i can sit on the phone for a while. it aint going anywhere and i have a backup one i can use. message me if can do a walk through at anothe rtime. thanks for the help. :)
00:41:14 <damienrg[m]> For my case, on my Linux laptop with the pixel USB-C to USB-C cable, the phone was not detected when I was in "Graphene OS fastboot".
00:41:14 <damienrg[m]> On another PC with Windows and the same USB-C cable, the install failed later.
00:41:14 <damienrg[m]> I bought a USB-A to USB-C cable and on the first time I was able to install GrapheneOS.
00:42:36 <damienrg[m]>  * For my case, on my Linux laptop with the pixel USB-C to USB-C cable, the phone was not detected when I was in "Graphene OS fastboot".
00:42:36 <damienrg[m]> On another PC with Windows and the same USB-C cable, the install went further but failed when copying files.

00:49:07 <vata0[m]> Anyone here running a 4a 5g yet? If so how’s she doing?
01:02:53 <zvl12[m]> <vata0[m] "Anyone here running a 4a 5g yet?"> yes, working nicely, no problems so far, updated today to the new release as well.  I am using a 4a as well, but i feel the 4a5G is working faster (also screen of 4a to small for me).. Besides one problem but no one seems to answer it !! 😇 : sms text messages not ringing on second profile : its me or gneral: i dont know
01:10:25 <Thatcher[m]> I'm concerned about the 4a's ability to handle future android versions, even with graphene
01:11:29 <grapheneos_user_> Hello all, I am flashing GrapheneOS on my Pixel 2 - I allowed OEM unlocking, and everything worked until I tried "fastboot flashing unlock", which outputted "FAILED (remote: Flashing Unlock is not allowed)".
01:11:59 <grapheneos_user_> I rebooted it and checked that I had done it, but OEM unlocking was greyed out.
01:12:45 <grapheneos_user_> I reset the phone to try again, allowed OEM unlocking (yes it worked) and then retried installing. The same output happened.
01:13:41 <grapheneos_user_> I had purchased the phone as unlocked, and was connected to the internet so GPlay Services would have authenticated OEM unlocking...
01:14:43 <grapheneos_user_> Is the phone locked? I am confused now
01:14:52 <penpal[m]> <vata0[m] "Anyone here running a 4a 5g yet?"> Runs smooth as butter, even better than stock pixel so far :D
01:16:29 <zvl12[m]> <penpal[m] "Runs smooth as butter, even bett"> indeed runs super smooth, but also due to the fact that you are installing only the important apps and not all the crap one used to have on a standard stock
01:16:56 <damienrg[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "Is the phone locked? I am confus"> After unlocking the phone, did you check that after the reboot OEM unlocking is still enabled?
01:17:12 <grapheneos_user_> <damienrg[m] "After unlocking the phone, did y"> yes
01:18:32 <grapheneos_user_> <damienrg[m] "After unlocking the phone, did y"> wait...you mean before trying to flash grapheneOS?
01:18:42 <grapheneos_user_> In that case no
01:19:17 <damienrg[m]> Yes.
01:20:09 <damienrg[m]> > For Pixel 2: To flash the bootloader, Pixel 2's boot loader must be updated to at least Oreo MR1's version first.
01:20:50 <damienrg[m]>  * > For Pixel 2: To flash the bootloader, Pixel 2's boot loader must be updated to at least Oreo MR1's version first.

01:21:39 <grapheneos_user_> "Your Pixel 2 is running the last version of Androix available on this device"
01:22:31 <grapheneos_user_> Are bootloader updates separate from Android updates damienrg: ?
01:23:23 <grapheneos_user_> Anyway I will reset the phone again so OEM unlocking isn't completely greyed out, so that way at least I can test it.
01:23:55 <damienrg[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "Are bootloader updates separate "> I would say no.
01:24:09 <grapheneos_user_> damienrg: Then I have the latest bootloader
01:25:12 <grapheneos_user_> I think I might know - maybe when the carrier lock period ended, it was sold as unlocked. But then the phone is still firmware locked so OEM unlocking is disabled.
01:29:53 <grapheneos_user_> Oh...now when I reset the phonedamienrg: , OEM unlocking is still greyed out.

04:32:36 <doittoit[m]> Looking into pixel 5 for GOS. Does GOS void the original pixel warranty?
04:36:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> doittoit: not really
04:38:35 <doittoit[m]> anupritaisno1: thx. I did not see this addressed on the GOS docs page. Did I miss something?
04:58:15 <DannyWorkOrderPr> doittoit: Don't think so - it's just usually not the first thing the security/privacy community tends to ask. AFAIK, Google is very okay with Pixels with custom software.
05:01:49 <take_a_deep_brea> doittoit:  if they wanted to void your warranty they wouldnt spend resources on getting https://flash.android.com
08:34:46 <p0tat0> hello! just finished installing gos. trying to install an apk through the files app, but the permission prompt is for vanadium. shouldn't it be for the 'files' app?
08:36:10 <p0tat0> i did get the apk through vanadium, but i'm not installing it directly through it. i thought the prompt is for the app used to install, or am i wrong?
08:37:35 <im0rtal[m]> <p0tat0 "i did get the apk through vanadi"> The source of apk download, which is vanadium in your case, should provide the permission to install apps from unknown sources.
08:39:55 <p0tat0> ok, got it. thank you!
08:40:23 <r0tt0r[m]> <p0tat0 "i did get the apk through vanadi"> if you go from file manager dont install from download folder shortcut. choose internal storage download and install you need to assign filemanager permission not browser to install
08:40:49 <p0tat0> just wondering, what would be displayed if I transfered it through usb for example?
08:41:43 <p0tat0> oh, ok
08:43:53 <p0tat0> thanks r0tt0r[m], it didn't ask for the browser permissions this time, worked like a charm!

09:37:43 <strcat[m]> Copperhead CEO has admitted to tracking users via unique identifiers (device identifiers) along with their phone sellers building databases mapping the identifiers to users, the tweets are archived so we have more than screenshots
09:38:19 <strcat[m]> and they have admitted to what we already knew from someone reverse engineering one of their releases which is that this is part of the update system among other things
09:38:30 <strcat[m]> and gives them the ability to ship a targeted malicious update to a user
09:39:05 <strcat[m]> for example, say that one of their customers speaks badly about them, they have the power to get the identifiers from the seller and use it to ship them a malicious update
09:39:10 <strcat[m]> and could do that for law enforcement
09:39:30 <strcat[m]> and you have to seriously question why James was so determined to build this kind of system, which was a major part of why he ended up pushing me out
09:39:50 <strcat[m]> because I refused to add anything like this and would have no part of building a separate proprietary variant of the OS doing it either

12:37:35 <timeo[m]> Does anyone know why the dialer app needs network access?
12:40:12 <timeo[m]> As well for the gallery and the  contact app
12:40:35 <Macrop> Guys I wanted to ask (and sorry if this is out of place, Iam not experienced). Can you use TWRP with GrapheneOS? I want to use GrapeheneOS with my Nokia 7 plus, would you advise against it?
12:42:04 <strcat> Macrop: no, and that device also isn't one of the officially supported ones
12:42:27 <strcat> GrapheneOS uses a secure first party recovery image and it isn't possible to use third party substitutes for OS components while using GrapheneOS
12:42:55 <strcat> it wouldn't be GrapheneOS, and since GrapheneOS uses verified boot and block-based updates providing all the firmware and OS images it couldn't work
12:43:24 <strcat[m]> totally possible to port GrapheneOS to other devices
12:43:35 <strcat[m]> doubt that one meets many of the important requirements to have a real port
12:44:35 <Macrop> well, would there be a point in trying? Or would recommend something else? Lineage OS isnt supported either. I really like the idea of "degoogled"
12:44:47 <Macrop> would you*
12:47:08 <Macrop> I mean there is an unofficial LineageOS rom on xda, but is that a good idea?
12:49:54 <simpletech> It isn't no. I mean, I propably works and you will get a running system for sure but but to be clear: You will loose a lot of security benefits of your phone.
12:50:13 <simpletech> *It propably works
13:06:19 <strcat[m]> Macrop: well, the channel is about GrapheneOS, and it doesn't support that device, and AOSP already doesn't have Google apps and services but rather just uses them as the default/fallback provider for certain standard open protocols
13:06:27 <strcat[m]> like NTP, which we don't use
13:08:47 <Macrop> right, sorry, I got a bit off track. I'll figure something out. Thanks for the help
13:23:40 <jcb[m]> <jcb[m] "Dictionary issue: I don't get co"> Is this a GOS issue or is it more general?
13:57:41 <r0tt0r[m]> i see dansk as language, isnt that danish?
13:58:20 <r0tt0r[m]> or is the issue only related keyboard?
14:04:20 <Guest13182> Hey, I hope youre enjoyning a nice sunday. Ive got a question I hope someone can help me with. Im currently flashing my new Pixel 4a using the web install method. Im currently on step "Flashing factory images" and ecountered the following "Error: Offset is outside the bounds of the DataView" On a quick research I found no solution to this. Is ist
14:04:21 <Guest13182> just a Java Script frontend Error or should i worry about it? The phone seems to stuck on the festbootd screen. Thanks in advance.
14:08:18 <damienrg[m]> strcat:  You told me that F-Droid APK on their site is not the last the version and thus I cannot install it one another profile by downloading it since the installation will fail because a more recent version is already installed in another profile. How can I install it then?
14:08:19 <strcat[m]> Guest13182: which OS / browser
14:08:49 <strcat[m]> damienrg: they list packages in their repository on their site, you can download the latest version from the page for F-Droid, but as I said, avoid the generic download link across all those pages
14:08:51 <strcat[m]> damienrg: it's out of date
14:08:58 <nscnt[m]> damienrg: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/
14:09:00 <strcat[m]> damienrg: make sure to tell them that this is bad for usability and they should fix it
14:10:46 <Guest13182> strcat  thanks for your reply. im on elementaryos (ubtuntu 20.04) and chromium
14:11:52 <strcat[m]> Guest13182: and you have enough free memory and disk space?
14:11:53 <strcat[m]> Guest13182: check that
14:12:05 <strcat[m]> Guest13182: I'd recommend closing the page, clearing browser cache completely, closing the browser and opening it again
14:12:06 <damienrg[m]> Ah OK, I did not see that they list all versions.
14:12:07 <strcat[m]> and then doing it again
14:13:29 <Guest13182> strcat[m] plenty ram and disk space:)
14:15:24 <jcb[m]> r0tt0r: You are right, Dansk is Danish. I can set Danish as the system language but under 'text correction' it is not there, whereas English, German, French etc are. I thought/think there might be a connection with the lack of word correction and suggestion?
14:16:25 <damienrg[m]> With multiple profiles, how sms and phone calls are shared? Is it a shared folder?
14:17:13 <damienrg[m]> In Vanadium, is it possible to add other default search engine?
14:18:22 <strcat[m]> damienrg: you can add search engines in Vanadium, same as other Chromium-based mobile browsers, you have to visit the search engine, use it, then go to settings and add it
14:18:30 <strcat[m]> damienrg: the search engine must have proper open search metadata
14:18:36 <strcat[m]> if they don't support it you need to report it to them
14:20:04 <strcat[m]> damienrg: so for example go to yandex.com, search, for something, then go to Settings -> Search engines and it's there as an option
14:21:27 <strcat[m]> damienrg: it depends on the search engine, yandex seems to require searching from the search page not their home page
14:21:31 <wanchu> Hi! I have been reading about GrapheneOS for a while and it seems like a great project, though my knowledge about security/privacy topics is small. If I am not mistaken, currently there is a lot of trust placed on Daniel Micay as the main developer (looks like 90% of the commits in GitHub belong to him), and he has a good track record as a security
14:21:31 <wanchu> professional.
14:21:32 <wanchu> However, it looks like there are no other big sources of trust like periodic 3rd party audits of the code specific to the project (I don't mean audits of AOSP) nor is there a big community of security researchers auditing the code for now. Is this true? Are external audits something that the project needs? I don't know much about security, but if
14:21:32 <wanchu> this is something important, do you know of any organization that would take donations for it? Like programs such as the Internet Bug Bounty that covers some open-source projects.
14:21:34 <strcat[m]> damienrg: just depends on they set up the metadata etc
14:22:01 <strcat[m]> wanchu: no, that's not true, there are other people reviewing the code
14:22:29 <strcat[m]> wanchu: bug bounties would just waste project resources with people trying to get money
14:22:59 <r0tt0r[m]> <jcb[m] "r0tt0r: You are right, Dansk is "> ok i see, maybe it is currently missing. not sure though
14:23:35 <strcat[m]> wanchu: there are multiple companies using the code and other independent people reviewing it
14:23:53 <strcat[m]> wanchu: and other projects based on the code
14:23:59 <wanchu> strcat[m] I see, thank you. Do you know if there are any public articles with the details of the reviews?
14:24:16 <Guest13182> strcat[m] i just started over with flashing and everything seemed to work now. Thanks for help
14:25:06 <strcat[m]> wanchu: there are few articles let alone accurate ones about GrapheneOS as a whole and non-technical journalists are not a reliable source of news on technology
14:25:27 <wanchu> that is a pity...
14:25:29 <strcat[m]> wanchu: particularly since it's largely just based on press releases, unverified information and conjecture/assumptions
14:25:52 <strcat[m]> wanchu: look at the latest v6 release of hardened_malloc
14:25:58 <strcat[m]> wanchu: 3 small fixes from https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/
14:26:04 <zzxx123> damienrg[m] some privacy search engines use POST(eg Whoogle and Startpage) by default, you need explicitly switch to GET request for browsers to detect them as search engine.
14:26:06 <strcat[m]> since they use it
14:26:19 <strcat[m]> wanchu: there multiple companies/organization uses GrapheneOS and GrapheneOS sub-projects
14:26:37 <strcat[m]> and they review the code and a couple of them occasionally submit something useful
14:26:50 <strcat[m]> wanchu: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc/compare/5...6
14:26:55 <wanchu> I see...
14:27:24 <wanchu> Maybe we could add a section to the GrapheneOS website explaining this other "sources of trust"?
14:27:45 <wanchu> *these
14:28:10 <strcat[m]> they aren't other sources of trust, they're other companies/organizations helping to improve the project and find issues
14:28:29 <strcat[m]> I don't feel a need to add testimonials or a list of companies/people using it to the site
14:28:56 <wanchu> OK, thanks for taking the time to explain the situation :-)
14:29:14 <wanchu> I will make a donation directly to the project, it seems that is the best way I can help
14:31:44 <strcat[m]> wanchu: and there are definitely other researchers, etc. using it, reviewing it and building stuff with it
14:31:52 <strcat[m]> separate from companies/orgs
14:32:00 <strcat[m]> difference between that and getting contributions
14:32:52 <wanchu> if I am not mistaken, your are Daniel Micay, right? :-)
14:34:06 <strcat[m]> yes
14:34:20 <strcat[m]> you can do /whois strcat for my irc account
14:34:53 <wanchu> great, thank you for taking the time to explain the details to me :-)
14:36:16 <damienrg[m]> Is there a way to boot directly in a specific profile?
14:36:48 <moonboy> hi guys, i get "Error: Timeout of 1000 ms exceeded" in fastbootd menue. why?
14:37:03 <moonboy> wrong cable?
14:37:59 <strcat[m]> moonboy: sounds like a broken USB port/cable
14:41:08 <damienrg[m]> strcat: do you recommend Signal?
14:41:10 <moonboy> strcat[m]: don't have a usb-c connection on my laptop and instead have this cable here: https://www.conrad.de/de/p/radxa-rockpi-usb2-0-type-atoc-strom-kabel-1x-usb-2-0-stecker-a-1x-usb-c-stecker-1-00-m-rot-2143261.html
14:41:30 <strcat[m]> moonboy: sounds like the cable is broken
14:41:40 <strcat[m]> moonboy: try a different USB port
14:41:44 <strcat[m]> but likely a cable issue
14:41:57 <moonboy> ty mate
14:42:09 <vdge[m]> I have a doubt. If we install a reasonably shady and closed source app from play store in the work profile without any permissions.
14:42:09 <vdge[m]> What unique data we can expect them to gather ?
14:42:37 <moonboy> so i need an adapter, yes? can you recommend one?
14:42:54 <strcat[m]> vdge: you could install it in your main profile
14:42:56 <strcat[m]> vdge: apps are sandboxed
14:43:18 <strcat[m]> profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox, that isn't the purpose
14:43:26 <strcat[m]> they provide a separate workspace
14:43:49 <strcat[m]> vdge: if you don't give the app access to personal data by granting it that, it doesn't get access to it
14:44:10 <strcat[m]> if you put it in a separate profile (we recommend user profiles, not trusting a third party device manager app) then that's an isolated workspace
14:44:16 <strcat[m]> so the shared data you can grant it access to is separate
14:44:23 <strcat[m]> but you could also just not grant it access to that shared data
14:44:41 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "profiles do not provide a strong"> Yes yes, I wouldn't want the apps to query the packages installed on my main profile which is a thing even in Android 11 but even after Google trying to limit it.
14:45:01 <strcat[m]> apps also can't communicate with mutual consent across user profiles (for work profiles that depends on the device manager's choice)
14:45:07 <strcat[m]> vdge: so install it in a separate user profile
14:45:20 <strcat[m]> vdge: Android 11 is not supposed to limit it just require apps to list certain things statically in their manifest
14:45:25 <strcat[m]> for API 30+
14:46:39 <strcat[m]> vdge: whether a work profile is isolated in a similar way to a user profile is up to the device manager, which is third party
14:47:02 <strcat[m]> our recommendation is using user profiles as isolated workspaces, not using the work profile feature designed for remote management of a work profile on BYOD devices
14:47:36 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to have a nested profile feature that's not a work profile but it doesn't exist atm
14:47:37 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "if you put it in a separate prof"> I use shelter. It's really convenient to not switch the profiles just to look for a small information in supposedly shady app.
14:48:48 <wanchu> is it possible to have Google Play Services enabled in only one user profile?
14:49:21 <vdge[m]> <vdge[m] "I use shelter. It's really conve"> Do you think apps can really bypass that if they want to ? I can see Google being strict with main and work profile isolation. Haven't seen any contradicting statements.
14:50:04 <strcat[m]> vdge: it's not about bypassing it
14:50:06 <strcat[m]> the OS feature works fine
14:50:20 <strcat[m]> vdge: a work profile is not owned by you, the OS is not putting you in control of it, that is not the purpose of it
14:50:26 <strcat[m]> vdge: the device manager app owns it and controls it
14:50:45 <strcat[m]> that app decides the configuration of it including whether it is isolated in terms of app communication, etc.
14:50:58 <strcat[m]> vdge: you'll need to get support for device managers from them
14:51:08 <strcat[m]> we recommend not using device managers or accessibility services
14:52:46 <vdge[m]> Ahhh makes sense. Thank you! Do you think open source device managers can severely hamper security unintentionally due to some oversight ? I thought it isn't possible  and I assumed they're just enabling work profile and don't decide the rules.
14:54:24 <strcat[m]> vdge: yes, they could set it up so that it's not isolated
14:54:32 <strcat[m]> vdge: we recommend user profiles, owned by you, the user, not a third party app
14:54:43 <strcat[m]> vdge: I cannot stop you from choosing to trust a third party app with managing a work profile
14:54:52 <strcat[m]> vdge: but it's not the responsibility of the OS
14:54:56 <somenerd[m]> >it would be possible to have a nested profile feature that's not a work profile but it doesn't exist atm
14:54:56 <somenerd[m]> Would be cool if they had the same home screen as well
14:55:25 <strcat[m]> vdge: you're not simply using a nested form of profile, you're using a device manager owned/controlled work profile, it has very specific semantics
14:55:33 <somenerd[m]> Something encouraging compartmentalization
14:55:45 <strcat[m]> vdge: you don't own it, the app does, so sure perhaps the app is designed to give you local control over it but it could screw things up
14:56:19 <strcat[m]> vdge: go look at what device manager permissions you've granted to that app too, it's quite possible you chose to give it control over a lot more than just the work profile as it would have with no extra device manager permissions
14:56:31 <strcat[m]> vdge: a device manager can mess up a lot more than a work profile
14:56:41 <strcat[m]> vdge: there's a reason we discourage using device managers or accessibility services
14:56:56 <strcat[m]> and there's a reason we show whether you have them enabled, and specifically third party ones, in the Auditor output
14:57:29 <strcat[m]> although if they don't request any device management permissions they can't do much beyond the work profile but it probably does request more than that
14:57:48 <somenerd[m]> remember a lock screen issue from a while ago
14:57:52 <strcat[m]> they have scope creep beyond the supposed purpose of managing a work profile
14:58:18 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "vdge: go look at what device man"> As for the shelter, it doesn't require any permissions apart from being the device admin to manage the work profile
14:58:32 <strcat[m]> vdge: I'm not talking about regular permissions
14:58:37 <strcat[m]> I'm talking about device manager permissions
14:58:45 <vdge[m]> But yeah! I get your point.
14:58:48 <strcat[m]> they are listed on the device manager page and you agreed to them as part of enabling it as a device manager
14:58:53 <strcat[m]> vdge: go look at the device manager page
14:59:00 <jcb[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "ok i see, maybe it is currently "> Thanks for responding though
14:59:05 <strcat[m]> there is a list of device manager permissions, that is an app-specific list, not generic
14:59:27 <strcat[m]> it's entirely possible for an app that say, does remote wipe, to only have the wipe device manager permission
14:59:49 <strcat[m]> you agreed to a list of device manager permissions there, and I'm sure it's beyond just managing the work profile (which afaik would be empty list basically)
15:00:36 <damienrg[m]> <damienrg[m] "strcat: do you recommend Signal?"> > For example, not permitting any third party / dynamic code at all and building the required apps like Signal into the OS.
15:01:31 <damienrg[m]> Anyway, I want to thank all people here that help newcomers like me.
15:04:19 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "they are listed on the device ma"> Thanks for this. I always see people recommending work profiles like a go to standard solution. This is an eye opener.
15:04:59 <strcat[m]> vdge: those apps tend to have scope creep (i.e. doing more than they should be) beyond managing a work profile
15:05:09 <strcat[m]> they like asking for further device management permissions like messing with the lockscreen
15:05:12 <strcat[m]> and can do weird stuff
15:05:31 <strcat[m]> they don't compromise the overall OS security unless they are a device owner, which we don't really support except via adb atm (has to do be done when setting up device)
15:05:49 <strcat[m]> but they can do pretty substantial things if you have permitted it
15:06:20 <strcat[m]> in general, I really recommend against using device managers or accessibility services except as a last resort
15:06:30 <strcat[m]> other than an accessibility service that's built into the OS which we'll be doing with talkback
15:07:41 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "in general, I really recommend a"> Done! haven't enabled accessibility services upto now obviously because Google openly discourages against it anyways.
15:07:53 <vdge[m]> One final question, If I install a regular app with zero permissions, what unique data can I expect to share apart from that app querying packages installed on my device ?
15:08:47 <strcat[m]> vdge: assuming you disable the Sensors permission too
15:08:52 <strcat[m]> vdge: which you can do before it can run
15:09:24 <strcat[m]> vdge: it knows the device model and OS of course, nothing that can be done about that
15:10:04 <strcat[m]> vdge: knows some basic things about global device configuration via system properties, etc. such as whether dark theme is enabled
15:10:08 <strcat[m]> you can look through those
15:10:17 <strcat[m]> nothing that identifies the device / user
15:11:50 <strcat[m]> vdge: it can generate a random number and store it in their internal storage or app-specific external storage directory (or use the app-specific 64-bit integer the OS generates based on signing key, not really useful when they can generate a proper id themselves though)
15:12:36 <strcat[m]> vdge: and within a profile, apps can communicate with mutual consent (listing other apps in the profile is part of this, the app can still figure out what's installed in the profile that way)
15:13:25 <strcat[m]> (trying to disable APIs for listing apps would just be privacy theatre without making a much bigger feature than that and it's why the Android 11 changes are not user-facing and do not do what you seemed to expect they were supposed to - they are for static analysis, etc.)
15:13:42 <strcat[m]> we don't do privacy theatre
15:14:45 <pacman37[m]> Was there an update recently? I found an update for the auditor app from plat store for like a week or 10 days..
15:14:48 <strcat[m]> vdge: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/156 is a possible feature, which would do what you want (not being app to see user installed apps) if you can tolerate that it can't communicate with user installed apps
15:14:53 <pacman37[m]> * Was there an update recently? I found an update for the auditor app from play store for like a week or 10 days..
15:15:05 <strcat[m]> pacman37: Auditor v24 and v25 came out recently, if that's what you mean
15:15:22 <strcat[m]> there's a recent GrapheneOS release not in the stable channel yet too
15:15:27 <strcat[m]> we announce releases
15:15:34 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
15:15:46 <strcat[m]>  * https://grapheneos.org/releases#release-announcements
15:15:59 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
15:16:10 <strcat[m]> that page has an atom feed
15:16:20 <strcat[m]> you can subscribe to it in an RSS/atom reader app if you want
15:16:36 <strcat[m]> or follow @GrapheneOS on Twitter
15:18:08 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "vdge: it can generate a random n"> Will it be persistent across sessions ? I always clear cache & storage of an app and then go ahead to uninstall it.
15:19:33 <strcat[m]> vdge: uninstalling already clears data
15:19:37 <strcat[m]> no need to do that manually
15:19:52 <strcat[m]> vdge: if it's an API 30 app then it can't save data past that
15:20:07 <strcat[m]> if it's not, then you also have to manually clear the app-specific data storage directory in the profile's home directory
15:20:19 <strcat[m]> for API 29 without legacy storage or for API 30, that's cleared automatically
15:21:55 <strcat[m]> vdge: a lot of this is covered in the GrapheneOS FAQ
15:22:02 <strcat[m]> and you can see our plans for future features on the issue tracker
15:22:38 <strcat[m]> issue tracker is for near to mid term possible features (i.e. within a couple months or years, they could be implemented, if there's interest)
15:23:44 <vdge[m]> I read some of the FAQ and probably missed these details but will have another look.
15:23:50 <vdge[m]> Thanks for taking time and making it clear 👍️
15:26:19 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "(trying to disable APIs for list"> Btw, doesn't apple do this by default by disabling the possibility of querying packages ? I don't see it clearly why it's a privacy theater by restricting every Tom's app to know the apps installed on the device which can be pretty much unique per user.
15:51:50 <somenerd[m]> He said, unless they make another feature (which is much larger), the feature of the APIs being disabled would be basically useless.
15:56:40 <strcat[m]> vdge: it is privacy theatre to implement a privacy feature which can simply be bypassed
15:57:04 <strcat[m]> vdge: and that applies to a lot of things people wrongly think are enforced by the iOS sandbox but rather are at most enforced by policy which is theoretically enforced via review and consequences for not following it
15:57:19 <strcat[m]> vdge: really not what I said at all
15:58:19 <strcat[m]>  * vdge: your portrayal of it is really not what I said at all
15:59:54 <serpantsauce[m]> Is anyone able to explain what happens when a Pixel becomes obsolete with Graphene? From what I read it looks like it might miss firmware updates but would it still receive OS updates from GrapheneOS?
16:00:43 <serpantsauce[m]> It looks like the latest Pixel 2 release from Graphene was fairly recent so it looks like it's still being updated, even though it's considered obsolete
16:02:44 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "vdge: really not what I said at "> C'mon noo! I didn't mean to portray anything. May be I just misunderstood your statement and asked if it's the right way to look at it.
16:06:22 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: Pixel 2 is end-of-life / insecure
16:06:26 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: doesn't matter which OS you run on it
16:06:44 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: we still release OS updates, yeah, extended support releases separate from the proper official releases
16:07:14 <serpantsauce[m]> <strcat "serpantsauce: we still release O"> Ah I see. So it's more for tinkering rather than actual use I guess?
16:07:21 <strcat> and we aren't investing effort into the dead end of fixing a larger subset of device-specific issues with it because no amount of work will make it secure
16:08:23 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: it's a stopgap for people on those while they move to a 4a / 4a (5G) / 5
16:09:37 <strcat> at some point we'll stop
16:09:40 <serpantsauce[m]> <strcat "serpantsauce: it's a stopgap for"> Gotcha. My issue is that the newer Pixels are only guaranteed support for another two years so I'm trying to decide if I should wait for the next Pixel to be released or just go through with it.
16:09:59 <serpantsauce[m]> I know CalyxOS supports older phones but I'd imagine they're lacking security updates so that may not be an option
16:10:31 <vdge[m]> <strcat[m] "vdge: and that applies to a lot "> I just read the github issue where you mentioned it more clearly why it's a privacy theater. Convinced! That totally makes sense now.
16:12:06 <strcat> vdge[m]: and keep in mind iOS has a lot of things where apps are not *allowed* to do it but *can* at a technical level if they wish
16:12:16 <strcat> vdge[m]: like their entire privacy disclosure thing they did recently
16:12:44 <strcat> vdge[m]: the reason for app devs to obey is theoretically getting into some kind of trouble with Apple if they don't but usually it's not that big of a deal especially for major apps
16:15:14 <somenerd[m]> Thought it would be worse for major apps, since they get more scrutiny
16:15:24 <somenerd[m]> offtopic convo though ig
16:15:52 <dazinism> vdge: made a wiki page about what apps can see
16:15:55 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
16:16:27 <dazinism> Things got tightened up significantly over the last few years.
16:20:29 <strcat[m]> somenerd: more scrutiny but fewer consequences
16:30:46 <serpantsauce[m]> Might be off-topic but does anyone know if any manufacturers are interested in developing an open source phone for Graphene?
16:31:07 <serpantsauce[m]> These Linux phones are sort of silly imo. Specifically the Librem 5.
16:32:59 <nechayev[m]> Locker on my graphene OS dont work properly
16:34:06 <nechayev[m]> Look, I tested it with typing 5 times wrong code and it dont delete anything
16:34:09 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: please read https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400
16:34:43 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: we're working on establishing partnerships with companies sharing the same goals of making truly private and security devices, rather than scamming people like nearly the entire privacy and security industries
16:35:10 <serpantsauce[m]> <strcat "serpantsauce: we're working on e"> Very cool. I hope it works out.
16:35:27 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: the initial goal is having a comparable device to a Pixel, which takes a lot, but whether the stock OS is GrapheneOS and we'd have somewhat more control over stuff below the OS layer
16:36:24 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: it's unrealistic for anything but a board design to be open source right now and there aren't any open source smartphones either launched or announced
16:36:45 <strcat> if by open source you mean all of the hardware and firmware being open, there's no such thing, and it's not feasible for a long time
16:37:20 <serpantsauce[m]> Awww. Maybe in the future. I can only dream. 😢
16:37:23 <strcat> there would need to be a company making a powerful open source non-ARM SoC + support for the architecture everywhere
16:37:36 <strcat> with all the necessary features
16:37:41 <strcat> not just a powerful open source CPU and GPU
16:38:19 <strcat> serpantsauce[m]: the most sophisticated RISC-V chips are not anywhere close and... they are not fully open source, and RISC-V itself is just the API for hardware <-> software (the ISA) doesn't imply that the hardware is open
16:41:39 <serpantsauce[m]> I think hardware definitely needs more focus from the community. Not this specific community, I just mean the privacy enthusiasts and tech communities as a whole.
17:01:20 <msbic> Hi.
17:01:21 <msbic> I am new to grapheneOS.
17:01:21 <msbic> I got myself a pixel 3 from ebay for the purposes of playing with GrapheneOS. The phone was sold by AT&T. It is unlocked in the sense that it'd work on a different network, however the OEM unlocking setting under dev options is greyed out. And the very first step in the installation guide requires the user to unlock to proceed.
17:01:22 <msbic> Is there a way to resolve this? Or was that purchase a waste of money?
17:01:22 <msbic> Any help is appreciated
17:01:55 <strcat> msbic: did you connect it to the internet?
17:02:13 <strcat> msbic: AT&T doesn't sell the Pixel 3 afaik
17:02:22 <strcat> and didn't
17:02:51 <strcat> hmm guess they did
17:02:59 <strcat> msbic: anyway good chance you were not sold what was claimed
17:04:25 <PeterEaston> msbic: That phone is carrier locked. I'm sorry; there's nothing we can do for you.
17:04:45 <PeterEaston> *sorry, not carrier locked, but very likely bootloader locked.
17:05:01 <strcat> should connect it to the internet and update it at least
17:05:15 <strcat> can check the carrierid to see if it is a Verizon phone
17:06:16 <msbic> I connected it to my wifi, no change
17:06:47 <PeterEaston> Good thinking. msbic:  if you have android debug bridge, you can try `adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid` and see if it returns "00000000". If it returns something like 00000001, that phone is locked.
17:08:18 <strcat> also if it's 1 it's a Verizon phone not AT&T
17:09:23 <msbic> Returns 00000001
17:09:54 <strcat> msbic: that's a Verizon sold phone
17:09:56 <strcat> not AT&T
17:10:03 <strcat> it's a locked Verizon model
17:10:29 <msbic> Ok. Any resistance is futile? All is lost?
17:10:31 <strcat> msbic: did it come with the original box?
17:10:39 <strcat> msbic: yes, it's bootloader locked verizon phone
17:10:42 <strcat> which it should say on the box
17:10:43 <msbic> No, no box
17:10:53 <strcat> msbic: it's likely they knew that and didn't say so
17:11:03 <strcat> because it's worth more sold as non-Verizon and they'd pretend they didn't know
17:11:09 <strcat> it's a common issue for resold phones
17:11:48 <strcat> msbic: look at `getprop ro.oem.key1` too
17:11:50 <strcat> what does that show?
17:12:34 <msbic> strcat G013A
17:22:02 <strcat> msbic: well that's pretty strange because that looks like an unlocked variant
17:22:56 <strcat> but carrierid says otherwise
17:23:18 <strcat> msbic: think it's a lost cause but don't know how you have a phone provisioned that way at the factory
17:23:26 <msbic> @strcat what can be done then?
17:23:32 <strcat> nothing realistically
17:23:48 <strcat> just don't know how you have a phone like that
17:24:07 <msbic> @strcat negative a result is a result. Will know better next time
17:34:11 <strcat[m]> msbic: it says it's a factory unlocked model but then the carrierid says it's locked
17:34:20 <strcat[m]> msbic: the OS is treated it as locked due to that carrierid
17:34:31 <strcat[m]> msbic: anyway see no way to do anything about that just never seen anything like that before

18:12:15 <nonie689[m]> oki.. i hasnt react cause of a Importent incomming call
18:38:40 <skagreek[m]> New to this IRC. Using gOS for over a month. Are there any alternative backup programs to do bit for bit backups?
18:39:37 <strcat> skagreek[m]: those wouldn't be recovable, and no, you can't, separately from that
18:40:08 <strcat> skagreek[m]: if you connected up to the SSD inside and did a bit for bit copy you couldn't decrypt that data anywhere else
18:40:24 <skagreek[m]> Thanks, I see.
18:40:24 <strcat> if you factory reset the phone and put back the data onto the SSD, it couldn't be decrypted
18:40:37 <strcat> skagreek[m]: but separately from that, an app cannot do that
18:40:37 <skagreek[m]> OK that makes sense.
18:40:57 <strcat> apps cannot access each other's data at all, or the OS data
18:41:10 <strcat> there is backup service infrastructure in the OS which is what Seedvault uses
18:41:16 <skagreek[m]> i was thinking along how iOS does it. Where when you recover, everything is back in place.
18:41:28 <strcat> skagreek[m]: that's what Seedvault does
18:41:37 <strcat> it just has limitations in the Seedvault app atm
18:41:44 <strcat> they are not OS limitations, they're Seedvault limitations
18:42:05 <skagreek[m]> got it. btw, this place is awesome. Glad i signed up. Thanks for the quick feedback :)
18:42:09 <strcat> skagreek[m]: 1) it doesn't support secondary users (no reason it can't, just doesn't atm)
18:42:51 <strcat> skagreek[m]: 2) it doesn't register itself as a local backup implementation, so apps disabling remote backups don't have their data backed up (this is what allowBackup="false" means for API 30+: disable remote backups, not all)
18:43:08 <strcat> skagreek[m]: 3) doesn't support backing up profile home directory (but you can do it yourself easily)
18:43:24 <strcat> skagreek[m]: those are the limitations of Seedvault, nothing wrong with the OS infra in those regards
18:43:27 <skagreek[m]> Yeah, that's what I really wanted to know. It's also limited by the apps themselves. Makes sense.
18:44:24 <strcat> skagreek[m]: allowBackup="false" meaning was changed to disabling remote backups, not local anymore
18:44:33 <strcat> skagreek[m]: Seedvault doesn't take advantage of that yet, that's a Seedvault issue
18:46:01 <skagreek[m]> Cool. Pretty happy with gOS (if that's how we name it for short). Using it for a month now, ditched all my apple products.
18:48:42 <skreett[m]> <skagreek[m] "Cool. Pretty happy with gOS (if "> I'm working on doing the same, though I have felt like I have something missing by not getting most of my notifications
18:50:02 <skagreek[m]> Exact same thing with me and my buddy. But we got use to it. Also helps detaching a little from the constant tech world at the same time.
18:50:05 <strcat[m]> skagreek: https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/165
18:50:40 <strcat[m]> skagreek: https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/57 (profile home directory issue)
18:51:22 <strcat[m]>  * skagreek: https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/165 (marking it as device-to-device for using the API 30+ allowBackup="false" change to disabling remote backups only)
18:52:38 <skagreek[m]> Very interesting.
18:53:36 <skagreek[m]> Yeah, I use a USB-C adapter to microSD. No reason we can't backup to a 256GB.
18:53:45 <skagreek[m]> Pixel 4a, BTW.
18:54:43 <strcat> don't see an issue filed about user profiles but there should be one, don't feel like looking closely
18:55:49 <skagreek[m]> Saved the link and looked through it at a glance. Will dig deeper for sure. Would be great to have a more thorough backup method.
18:56:50 <strcat[m]> skagreek: well, this is what there will be
18:56:55 <strcat[m]> so if you want stuff added has to happen there
18:57:09 <strcat[m]> it basically backs up all the relevant OS data already
18:57:20 <strcat[m]> obviously can't backup/restore hardware keystores
18:58:05 <strcat[m]> skagreek: it's just missing support for some stuff (secondary profiles, ignoring allowBackup="false" now that it means 'disable remote backups' for API 30+ and profile home directories)
18:58:16 <strcat[m]> skagreek: those are 3 limitations of that app, not the OS infrastructure
18:58:25 <strcat[m]> there is nothing to improve in the OS that I see
18:58:46 <skagreek[m]> Oh I totally get it on the OS side. This is outside of the OS for sure.
19:00:34 <strcat[m]> skagreek: well it has to be whitelisted by the OS as a backup provider but beyond that it seems the OS has everything needed now
19:01:40 <strcat[m]> skagreek: if there is some OS data missing the way to deal with that is making a system app which has a backup hook to store the data in a portable format and restore from it as was done for contacts
19:01:53 <strcat[m]> skagreek: that was it's forwards / backwards compatible
19:01:57 <strcat[m]>  * skagreek: that way it's forwards / backwards compatible
19:02:19 <strcat[m]> essentially there are just those 3 major issues though
19:02:22 <strcat[m]> which are all app issues
19:02:33 <strcat[m]>  * which are all Seedvault app issues
19:02:37 <skagreek[m]> Hopefully they will listen to the community.
19:02:50 <strcat[m]> the allowBackup="false" thing is basically just a decision
19:02:59 <strcat[m]> and it should be done because it makes sense to treat it as local
19:03:02 <skagreek[m]> Where can I change that?
19:03:09 <strcat[m]> and it's only for API 30+ and is clearly documented as a change for devs
19:03:13 <strcat[m]> and they can deal with it
19:03:37 <strcat[m]> there is also a lint warning that already discouraged allowBackup rather than making a blacklist of files to exclude (caches, session tokens, device-specific data, etc.)
19:03:55 <strcat[m]> anyway now allowBackup means whether remote backup is allowed
19:04:05 <strcat[m]> local always allowed (for modern API 30+ apps)
19:04:15 <strcat[m]> skagreek: you can't change it without making your own OS builds
19:04:39 <skagreek[m]> Oh wow, OK.
19:05:45 <skagreek[m]> I'm good in the meantime. This really would have helped when i kept going back and forth with new installs like twice a day. haha
19:06:34 <strcat> skagreek[m]: basically atm you use Seedvault + another thing to backup home directory
19:06:41 <strcat> and for secondary profiles you can only do home directory atm
19:06:49 <strcat> til Seedvault learns to do it
19:08:02 <skagreek[m]> cool. I can also use a NOVA launcher backup to save my launcher settings. That's one of the things I didn't like about restoring with seedvault. It just dumped everything and I had to redo the launcher positioning each time.
19:13:38 <Randyrandom> hi, when access to "telephone" is denied, an app cant see Imei or number?
19:27:41 <TheJollyRoger> For reference in case Randyrandom returns and I'm not here: apps cannot see IMEI or non-resettable hardware identifiers: https://grapheneos.org/faq#non-hardware-identifiers
19:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> Only legitimate system functions absolutely required to connect to the cellphone network have access to those.
21:30:47 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.02.19.15 now in Stable channel

23:13:29 <anonxyz[m]> Hello all I have graphene newly installed but I am wondering if there is a safe way to remove some of the os preinstalled system apps?
23:19:31 <strcat[m]> anon.xyz: you can disable apps, stick to disabling stuff that's shown as a regular app though
23:19:45 <strcat[m]> don't disable core OS stuff that's hidden until you show system apps unless you want to break stuff
23:20:40 <xx> What is preinstalled beside vanadium, pdf viewer, calc calendar etc..? I don't see any unnecessary apps installed.
23:20:57 <xx> And about vanadium i would pay to get it on other OSes
23:36:44 <b1101> the only app I really want to be able to disable is messaging.
23:36:50 <croatoan> Hey all, wondering if I could get some help with an install that seems to be stuck on a Pixel 4a.
23:37:29 <rny> croatoan: did you use the web installer?
23:38:30 <croatoan> I started there but it gave me an error during the install. So I went to CLI but the flash-all.sh scripts seems to be taking a while and all I have is a blinking cursor.
23:38:48 <croatoan> I ended up in fastboot mode after the web install
23:41:12 <croatoan> How long does flash-all.sh usually take?
23:41:44 <croatoan> probably been 5 minutes now, much longer when I was flashing ROMs on my other phone...think it is dead
23:42:54 <croatoan> Maybe if I run the commands in flash-all.sh I can get an idea on errors?
23:43:04 <rny> unplug your cable and plug in again
23:43:08 <rny> and repeat web install steps
23:43:19 <rny> reboot your phone into bootloader mode again
23:43:21 <croatoan> i did that once already
23:43:36 <croatoan> should I kill the script?
23:43:41 <rny> croatoan: yes
23:44:10 <croatoan> ok, BRB
23:51:58 <skagreek[m]> <b1101 "the only app I really want to be"> I've always wanted to disable regular SMS texts, but I think it's more important to do it at the carrier level because the SMS people send you still exists in the systems even without the messaging app (I'm sure you know that already) just curios if that's also your reason. So far, none of the carriers have a way to truly SMS in the U.S. so that texts people send you get
23:51:58 <skagreek[m]> rejected.

23:52:33 <croatoan> rny: seems to be working this time!
23:52:51 <rny> croatoan: the usb interface is a bit flaky
23:53:03 <rny> and requires manual attachment/detachment if the installation process hangs
23:53:41 <rny> strcat: probably a good idea to add an instruction asking users to manually attach/detach the usb cable and restart the process
23:53:49 <croatoan> Yeah, I noticed that. The first time I went to flash the device kept vanishing and reappearing.
23:55:22 <rny> yeah that happens to me routinely also
23:55:32 <b1101> skagreek[m]: I mean they're always gonna collect that data :P but I just don't like having it in my drawer.
23:55:34 <rny> maybe a cheap usb hub (shrugs)
23:56:02 <croatoan> Thanks a bunch rny, and the rest of you all. Was so sick of Apple making it impossible to do anything and Google screwed me over so GrapheneOS is a godsend.
23:56:39 <rny> croatoan: 👍
