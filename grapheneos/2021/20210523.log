17:34:58 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Lol
17:36:15 <Railgun_Lover[m]> You're massacring them
17:36:35 <strcat> they're mostly ghosts
17:37:07 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Wait a second, you did say to kick all freenode users...
17:37:15 <strcat> on matrix
17:37:17 <strcat> not on freenode
17:37:25 <louipcm> it was like 100 ghosts on offtopic
17:37:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <strcat "on matrix"> Oh
17:39:55 <Railgun_Lover[m]> RIP

17:40:21 <Railgun_Lover[m]> GrapheneOS Matrix Room 2019-2021
17:40:57 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Unless this room existed before then when it was called copperhead is, if then 2015-2021
17:41:08 <Elementoshi[m]> <Railgun_Lover[m] "GrapheneOS Matrix Room 2019-2021"> F
17:41:32 <Elementoshi[m]> Long live the new GrapheneOS room
17:42:13 <Elementoshi[m]> I just realized it's been a while since I last saw any Copperhead spam/fuckery. That's nice.
17:42:39 <Railgun_Lover[m]> They have mostly stopped
17:43:05 <Railgun_Lover[m]> It remains to be seen whether that lasts, but it seems so
17:57:37 <louipc> test
17:58:30 <strcat[m]> louipc: it will add them back when there are net splits etc
17:59:40 <louipcm> makes sense
18:02:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Elementoshi[m] "I just realized it's been a whil"> Yeah, there's a new cooperhead in town
18:07:41 <Elementoshi[m]> What do you mean?
18:14:40 <strcat> there's another organization attacking us and spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS, not a good topic for this channel even before it was dead

18:51:20 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Apologies, just was supposed to hint about it
19:17:16 <Elementoshi[m]> strcat: pings the entire Matrix room
19:17:16 <Elementoshi[m]> everyone on IRC: oh no! anyway

19:18:07 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: perfectly capable of pinging irc users
19:18:09 <strcat[m]> been doing that
19:18:11 <strcat[m]> have a script
19:18:23 <Elementoshi[m]> oh cool
19:18:23 <strcat> moving off freenode is urgent
19:18:34 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
19:18:37 <strcat> it got worse since this
19:18:58 <strcat> if you reused your freenode nickserv pass elsewhere, etc. you better go change those
19:19:30 <strcat> probably no point of removing email/password, etc. from it at this point
19:19:40 <strcat> next time use a random password
19:24:57 <Elementoshi[m]> Wait a minute... I'm reading about this guy, and it says he founded Private Internet Access before it was bought in 2019. PIA has something to do with Freenode, right?
19:40:29 <strcat[m]> no
19:40:34 <strcat[m]> PIA was sold to another company in 2019
19:40:37 <strcat[m]> he isn't involved with it anymore
19:40:51 <strcat[m]> he was cross-promoting things he owned from each other even though they weren't in any way related or tied together
19:41:05 <strcat[m]> PIA does not appear to ever have had any overlap with this
19:41:10 <strcat[m]> he was just promoting them from each other

19:54:28 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to Freenode: #grapheneos:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org. We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but we'll be focusing on Matrix.

19:54:32 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
19:54:34 <strcat> If your Matrix client has the previous aliases cached with the old rooms, use #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org as a workaround.
19:54:36 <strcat> if enough people are interested in the libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic rooms we'll figure out a leaner way to bridge it without having a bridge bot requiring mod powers in the Matrix room to invite/kick virtual irc users and kick Matrix users for lurking (really bad experience).
