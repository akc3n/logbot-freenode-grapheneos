00:08:15 <strcat[m]> borges: you don't need adb
00:08:23 <strcat[m]> borges: you could transfer the file with MTP and then install it
00:08:34 <strcat[m]> borges: adb isn't really meant to be used on a production device
00:08:42 <strcat[m]> and you're placing enormous trust in the attached computer
00:08:53 <strcat[m]> using MTP is a lot less bad
00:09:25 <strcat[m]> (still not great since it's not granular, it'd be nice to have a form of file transfer where you have to authorize it)
00:09:32 <strcat[m]> (beyond just which user profile is granting access)
00:10:17 <bizanon[m]> What's better than mtp?
00:10:43 <sjsndnjdejd> Isn’t Google going to replace MTP I the future
00:10:57 <sjsndnjdejd> With their proprietary protocol
00:11:05 <Guest74007> anyone have any advice on an issue for install? I've got problems trying to do a fresh install on a pixel 5
00:11:10 <borges[m]> strcat: and once transfered, how would I install it?
00:11:22 <bizanon[m]> Can u scp thru terminal? Haven't tried so curious
00:13:17 <bizanon[m]> > strcat: and once transfered, how would I install it?
00:13:17 <bizanon[m]> Install it like regular
00:19:46 <oncurve> with  a Pixel4a just curious how long flash-all.sh takes
00:20:29 <Guest74007> anyone else having pixel 5 install problems?
00:21:21 <GroverWilson[m]> I tried to install on a pixel 5 but had a verizon locked phone, now Im using a Pixel4a (just installed for the first time 5 minutes ago)
00:21:53 <Guest74007> I'm on an unlocked pixel 5 ... I keep getting a transfer error... I have no idea whats going on
00:21:59 <oncurve> GroverWilson[m] how long did it take to run "fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-sunfish-s5-0.3-7062598.img" ?
00:22:11 <GroverWilson[m]> maybe 10 minutes
00:22:40 <oncurve> GroverWilson[m] did u flash the phone with the phone on the FASTBOOT screen?
00:22:45 <oncurve> that's what the instructions seem to say
00:23:01 <oncurve> i used the volume button to unlock the bootloader, but i'm on this fastboot screen
00:24:00 <oncurve> the instructions only said to accept unlocking, which i did.  says in red "unlocked"
00:25:01 <GroverWilson[m]> is the script doing anything?
00:25:12 <oncurve> it's running "fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-sunfish-s5-0.3-7062598.img"
00:25:17 <oncurve> but i don't see anything else
00:25:23 <GroverWilson[m]> there was a lot going on while it ran and my phone screen changed a few times
00:25:44 <oncurve> my phone hasn't moved. still on fastboot screen for like 15min
00:26:05 <COVID-1984> my pixel 3a just started bootlooping 0_0
00:26:13 <COVID-1984> holding power won't stop it so I'll just let it run out of batteries
00:26:56 <COVID-1984> after being on the grapheneOS screen for about 10s the logo fades, and it boot loops
00:28:36 <oncurve> i'm on fastboot 30.0.5 i wonder if i need 31.0.0
00:30:34 <GroverWilson[m]> I was using fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874. I installed it manually instead of using the Fedora package then I had to change my udev rules
00:31:15 <oncurve> i'm using arch, seems like the arch instructions are pretty easy
00:32:52 <COVID-1984> daman this is crazy... if i try recovery mode or rescue mode it just goes to a "?" ... If I try "power off" it just boot cycles.
00:32:59 <GroverWilson[m]> the flash-all changed my fastboot screen to say "GraphineOS"
00:33:00 <COVID-1984> Happened in the middle of watching videos and not even touching the thing.
00:33:11 <COVID-1984> And I've been planning to back it up :(((
00:33:41 <COVID-1984> I don't see what else can be done except let the battery die and try again... And will have to spend tomorrow scouring the web to see if it can be fixed
00:34:18 <oncurve> GroverWilson[m]how long did it take to change the text?
00:36:41 <GroverWilson[m]> I still have it in my terminal: Finished. Total time: 168.262s
00:37:26 <GroverWilson[m]> the first this it did was "Sending 'bootloader_a"
00:37:59 <GroverWilson[m]> that took under a second to finish
00:39:28 <oncurve> did u run as root or as user?
00:40:33 <GroverWilson[m]> as user but I had to add my user to the "plugdev" group then logout and login again
00:41:32 <oncurve> hmmm
00:41:46 <GroverWilson[m]> you should be able to run "adb devices" and "fastboot devices" to see that everything is working
00:42:32 <oncurve> i see a device in fastboot
00:42:44 <oncurve> but it's still stuck here and i can't kill teh fastboot process
00:42:51 <oncurve> not even with -9
00:46:52 <oncurve> gotta reboot
01:15:01 <oncurve> didn't know there was a web install.  WOW, it was easy
01:15:22 <GroverWilson[m]> did it all work this time?
01:16:29 <oncurve> yes!
01:16:36 <oncurve> the web install was insanely easy
01:16:45 <oncurve> now, i need to get my contacts off my old phone
01:16:51 <oncurve> and install f-droid and stuff
01:19:35 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> GrapheneOS is the first custom ROM I saw has its own self-installing "program". I congratulate whoever got the idea for such great design.
01:20:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> GrapheneOS sure is one of, if not the best custom ROM I know.
01:36:19 <oncurve> what email client should i use?
01:36:55 <dannyknoll3Danny> <oncurve "didn't know there was a web inst"> Where did you hear about it?
01:37:12 <oncurve> dannyknoll3Danny it's right on the website
01:37:19 <oncurve> cli install / web install
01:37:33 <dannyknoll3Danny> oncurve: Where do you hear about Graphene, is what I was getting at
01:37:37 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install/ is the landing page for installing and lists both, with web install recommended
01:37:44 <oncurve> youtube
01:37:53 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli mentions web install and similarly https://grapheneos.org/install/web mentions cli install
01:38:13 <strcat> and https://grapheneos.org/faq#install has the same content as https://grapheneos.org/install/
01:38:37 <strcat> so I don't think we can do much to improve it and guide people that aren't experienced with CLI towards using the web installer any more than we already do
01:38:57 <oncurve> i tried the CLI, i've rooted things before, not sure why it hung.
01:39:04 <oncurve> but the web installer was ezpz
01:39:21 <oncurve> problem is, google hosts my email
01:39:27 <oncurve> not sure what email client i can use
01:39:53 <oncurve> and i keep getting f-droid related complaints about "this being built on an older version of android"
01:40:26 <GroverWilson[m]> In inbetween moving to protonmail from gmail so I may just use protonmail and not install gmail
01:58:17 <akc3n[m]> <oncurve "and i keep getting f-droid relat"> https://forum.f-droid.org/t/why-does-the-f-droid-website-nearly-always-host-an-outdated-f-droid-apk/6234/33
02:06:40 <sphinx[m]> I don't think that's related
02:07:47 <strcat> oncurve: Gmail works fine via FairEmail and other email clients including push notifications
02:08:42 <akc3n[m]> <sphinx[m] "I don't think that's related"> My bad. Thanks for pointing that out.
02:24:09 <gnome_giga_vegan> fairemail vs k9 email opinions?
02:28:43 <ulmirdin[m]> K9 looks better, imo.
02:36:33 <ulmirdin[m]> But I couldn't login into my account through it today, idk what happened.
02:42:08 <oncurve> i can't get any email to work.  gmail freaks and blocks it
02:43:41 <ulmirdin[m]> Enable "allow insecure apps to connect" (I don't remember the name of it exactly) in your google account.
02:44:28 <louipc> oh yea its something in the pop/imap setting
02:45:07 <oncurve> i thought i had that on already, need to checkl
02:47:15 <ulmirdin[m]> <ulmirdin[m] "K9 looks better, imo."> Just checked out FairEmail again, it really has an outdated UI.
02:54:45 <oncurve> i guess yahoo has the same crap
02:55:26 <doittoit[m]> Question: can I run GOS on a carrier pixel phone tied to att or Verizon?
02:57:04 <ulmirdin[m]> No
02:58:04 <doittoit[m]> What's the difference? Can I get a carrier unlock request?
02:58:09 <ulmirdin[m]> You can try to get them to unlock it for you, but it's hard to manage.
02:59:25 <doittoit[m]> You mean I can contact the carrier and ask to get the phone universally unlocked?
03:01:10 <ulmirdin[m]> Yeah, say you're a developer and you need it for testing. I heard this worked with someone.
03:02:03 <doittoit[m]> Cool tip thx
03:02:09 <ulmirdin[m]> <doittoit[m] "What's the difference? Can I get"> Carrier usually locks the bootloader, so there is no way to flash graphene or any other custom ROM.
03:02:46 <doittoit[m]> <ulmirdin[m] "Carrier usually locks the bootlo"> So universal unlock request solves this?
03:04:09 <ulmirdin[m]> Depends on customer support, they might just kick you out. They aren't really supposed to do that.
03:05:48 <HowardR> Having built sdk_phone_x86_64, I'm thinking the next step toward contributing free programming would be to set up some kind of debugging environment. Is there a guide for that? If not how can I do that?

05:54:05 * borges[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DQIMCKGBJfEURYPryUEVwxsx/message.txt >
05:55:31 <borges[m]>  * bizanon: I'm not sure what that means. Coming from stock android "regular" means from an app store like the play store. Since GOS has no app store, what does "regular" mean in this context? Can you be more explicit?
05:55:34 <strcat[m]> download and install the app
05:56:14 <borges[m]> Maybe I'm brain-dead, but what is the install process for an apk residing on internal stoage?
05:56:14 <strcat[m]> and you can certainly use an app store on GrapheneOS
05:56:24 <strcat[m]> borges: download and open it
05:56:30 <TheJollyRoger> borges[m]: you open it in file browser and tap on it twice.
05:56:31 <strcat[m]> borges: same as the stock OS
05:56:45 <TheJollyRoger> *navigate to it in file browser and tap on the icon twice.
05:57:22 <borges[m]> ok, I've never tried that. I think when I loaded via adb it didn't show up for the non-Owner user. I'm guessing if I did it through MTP it would?
05:57:32 <TheJollyRoger> Note that if you downloaded it through Vanadium, you will need to give Vanadium the permission to install other apps, then you will need to confirm on it.
05:58:21 <TheJollyRoger> borges[m]: take note that if you are installing an app into another profile, you *must* install the same version OR a newer one, or you will get "Error: app not installed" because your phone detects a downgrade.
05:58:34 <strcat[m]> borges: you can download an app on the device
05:58:40 <strcat[m]> you don't need to use adb or mtp
05:58:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, just use Vanadium to do it.
05:58:58 <strcat[m]> borges: transferring a file with adb or mtp would work fine but neither is needed
05:59:05 <strcat[m]> and strongly recommend against using adb on a production device
05:59:11 <strcat[m]>  * and we strongly recommend against using adb on a production device
05:59:20 <borges[m]> Ok, there's missing context, my original question was about installing an app without using Vanadium
05:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> So for instance, if you have Super-Awesome-App-Store-v1.5 installed in Owner, and try to install Super-Awesome-App-Store-v1.4 install in Secondary, your phone will deny the install.
05:59:29 <strcat[m]> it substantially reduces the security of your device by placing a huge amount of trust in the computer you trusted with adb access
06:00:04 <strcat[m]> borges: you can open it with the file manager
06:00:08 <strcat[m]> maybe you're not using the file manager correctly
06:00:24 <strcat[m]> maybe you're looking at files marked as downloads instead of viewing the profile's home directory
06:00:35 <strcat[m]> it's the same as the stock OS and I don't think it's particularly complicated
06:00:41 <strcat[m]> I suggest trying it rather than asking here
06:00:53 <borges[m]> I'm not super familiar with non-Owner users with stock either
06:00:59 <borges[m]> yeah, trying things now
06:01:07 <strcat[m]> not different from the owner user in this regard
06:01:36 <strcat[m]> and again, strongly recommend against using adb on a production device and you shouldn't expect development tools for app/OS developers to offer a UI that makes sense as an end user
06:01:59 <strcat[m]> I think you were just trying to look at downloads instead of the home directory in the file manager
06:04:34 <borges[m]> Well one issue for me is that I'm on Linux and never really got MTP working in a way I liked (only works should GUI iirc). Adb has always been easier for me (and I am a dev in other contexts)
06:07:33 <strcat[m]> mtp works fine via CLI
06:07:53 <strcat[m]> borges: adb on a production device drastically reduces the security of it since your desktop/laptop is far less secure
06:08:14 <strcat[m]> borges: and not to mention all kinds of stuff can be trivially done with it that's not advisable
06:08:57 <GebericFemaleNam> Hi
06:08:58 <strcat[m]> it means if someone compromises that computer they can install an app, grant it dangerous/development permissions, make it a device manager, make it an accessibility service, etc.
06:09:10 <GebericFemaleNam> is SMS app sandboxed
06:09:19 <strcat> all apps are sandboxed
06:13:04 <zzxx123_> Was that a troll or what
06:13:53 <rny> can we have a ban bot that autobans anyone that suggest apps are not sandboxed?
06:14:02 <rny> makes life easier for everyone
06:15:07 <zzxx123_> I saw somebody today asking this same exact question
06:15:19 <zzxx123_> and this person joined just to ask this question
06:15:26 <zzxx123_> looks suspicious
06:17:12 <borges[m]> Ok, here's what I'm trying to do. I have fdroid apk on my laptop and I want to install it on a non-Owner user. I have copied it to root of the internal storage via MTP when logged in to the Owner account. MTP does not work when not logged on to the Owner account. I open up the Files app in the Owner account and verify that fdroid apk is there. Then I switch user to the non-Owner account. I open Files and look at the
06:17:12 <borges[m]> root of the internal storage. The apk does not show up. Could this be new behavior in Android 11 (scoped storage?)?
06:18:47 <zzxx123_> Users don’t share data that’s the point
06:19:05 <zzxx123_> like how it would on a computer
06:19:31 <zzxx123_> Why can’t you  use vanadium ?
06:19:37 <borges[m]> Ok, so if MTP is disabled for non-Owner account then why are people saying that I can use MTP to transfer and apk to install on a non-Owner account?
06:20:04 <strcat[m]> borges: you're confused
06:20:09 <strcat[m]> user profiles do not have shared data
06:20:17 <strcat[m]> borges: you're not looking at 'the root of internal storage'
06:20:23 <strcat[m]> you're looking at the profile's home directory
06:20:40 <strcat[m]> I don't know why you think that's the 'root of internal storage'
06:20:49 <strcat[m]> you're just overcomplicating this so much
06:20:58 <borges[m]> hmm, ok, it looks awefully similar to the root of the internal storage. How do I get to the root then?
06:21:09 <strcat[m]> what?
06:21:16 <zzxx123_> you don’t
06:21:21 <borges[m]> I think thre's a misunderstanding of terms here
06:21:21 <strcat[m]> I don't even know what you're really talking about
06:21:28 <strcat[m]> user profiles do not share data
06:21:36 <strcat[m]> there is not shared data or communication across user profiles
06:21:39 <zzxx123_> You don’t have the permissions to access /
06:21:52 <strcat[m]> please just download and install the app instead of overcomplicating things
06:22:02 <Finland11> should i setup a guest profile
06:22:14 <strcat[m]> Finland11: secondary users are very useful
06:22:19 <Finland11> what security benefits are provide
06:22:20 <strcat[m]> guest profile is not very useful for most people
06:22:32 <strcat> Finland11: please stop cycling through new usernames
06:22:36 <borges[m]> Ok, then was I misinformed when I was told that I could use MTP to upload an apk to install?
06:22:36 <strcat> Finland11: use 1 userna,e
06:22:52 <borges[m]>  * Ok, then was I misinformed when I was told that I could use MTP to upload an apk to install to a non-Owner account?
06:22:57 <strcat> Finland11: it's hard for people on Matrix to see it's the same person
06:23:06 <Finland11> what security benefits are with secondary profiles
06:23:31 <strcat> Finland11: what have you looked at for information and read about it?
06:23:57 <strcat> borges[m]: you're really overcomplicating this
06:25:22 <borges[m]> If I've already downloaded a bunch of apks and I don't want to or can't redownload them (say network not accessible), I'm trying to find a way to install them without Vanadium. If it can't be done just say so.
06:25:33 <strcat> it can be done
06:26:14 <borges[m]> How about you suggest going about that?
06:26:26 <borges[m]>  * How would you suggest going about that?
06:26:50 <pizzaeater69[m]> Ookko nää Suomalaine:D Finland11
06:28:15 <rny> big troll
06:28:16 <strcat[m]> borges: make secondary user -> switch to secondary user -> plug into computer -> enable file transfer
06:28:20 <strcat[m]> borges: transfer files to it
06:28:27 <strcat[m]> I just did it, works fine
06:28:56 <strcat[m]> in the file manager on the phone, press the storage volume named after the device to access the profile's home directory
06:29:05 <strcat[m]> it is profile-specific, as is all other data stored in profiles
06:29:52 <strcat[m]> each user profile has a separate instance of apps, app data and profile data (files, contacts, and other data not stored by apps)
06:30:35 <strcat[m]> I just plugged my phone into my Windows 10 computer while on the secondary user, enabled file transfer, and there it is in the Windows file manager, and that transfers data to/from the active profile (where file transfer had to be enabled)
06:30:56 <strcat[m]> profiles can't share data, and file transfer is to/from the profile's home directory
06:31:19 <strcat[m]> certainly not from the internal storage root
06:31:32 <strcat[m]> it is only to/from the profile's home directory
06:31:44 <strcat[m]> not app storage directories, not OS storage directories, etc.
06:32:07 <strcat[m]> and then just install the apps by opening the apks
06:32:13 <strcat[m]> there's no need for adb
06:32:52 <borges[m]> Ok, I think the step that's not working for me, is that I'm not able to connect via MTP when the non-Owner account is logged in. Only when the Own account is logged in
06:33:03 <strcat[m]> did you enable file transfer?
06:33:14 <strcat[m]> you have to enable it, every time, in the active profile
06:33:23 <strcat[m]> when you connect to the computer, you have to enable it
06:33:27 <borges[m]> Hmm, perhaps not
06:33:39 <strcat[m]> it won't allow file transfer without explicitly enabling it, each time
06:33:40 <zzxx123_> Use python’s one liner simple file server
06:33:51 <strcat[m]> it's the same as the stock OS
06:33:59 <strcat[m]> when you plug in USB it gives a notification for controlling the transfer mode
06:34:14 <strcat[m]> you have ADB enabled so you've also got a notification about ADB, which is part of you overcomplicating things by using developer tools
06:34:42 <strcat[m]> the file transfer is to/from the user profile's home directory
06:34:43 <zzxx123_> python3 -m http.server 8000
06:34:46 <strcat[m]> and requires consent, every time
06:34:52 <strcat[m]> from the relevant user profile
06:35:01 <strcat[m]> you really don't need a file server
06:35:11 <strcat[m]> MTP is really easy to use
06:35:13 <strcat[m]> works fine
06:35:33 <strcat[m]> just don't overcomplicate things, non-technical people manage to do this fine, because they aren't making it overly complex
06:35:50 <borges[m]> Hmm, I get the ADB notification, but not a file transfer notification. I don't remember enabling that on the Owner profile either, but that might ahve been done automatically from the restore
06:35:52 <strcat[m]> you plug it in, turn on file transfer, and transfer files in the file manager
06:36:03 <strcat[m]> borges: it requires consent, every time, it's not persistent
06:36:10 <borges[m]> Just pretend I'm not using ADB that has nothing to do with this and isn't confusing me
06:36:15 <strcat[m]> borges: I suggest doing a factory reset, unable to provide more support without knowing what you have changed with ADB
06:36:41 <strcat[m]> entirely possible you changed dev options you shouldn't have or did something weird with ADB
06:36:43 <strcat[m]> I don't know
06:37:04 <strcat[m]> there is no reason for this to be so complicated.
06:37:21 <strcat[m]> maybe you don't have working USB and/or MTP on your desktop
06:37:35 <borges[m]> I do have working MTP, its works for Owner just fine
06:37:48 <strcat[m]> switch to the secondary user
06:37:49 <strcat[m]> plug in the cable
06:37:52 <strcat[m]> turn on file transfer
06:38:04 <strcat[m]> have you done that?
06:38:11 <borges[m]> Is there a place in settings that I can turn on the file transfer? I don't see a notification
06:38:25 <borges[m]> yes, I did that, but no notification
06:38:38 <strcat[m]> it makes a notification when the cable is plugged in
06:38:59 <strcat[m]> (a silent notification listed at the bottom)
06:39:03 <borges[m]> Ok, I see it now
06:39:31 <strcat[m]> turn on file transfer, transfer files, open file manager, look at the home directory
06:39:34 <borges[m]> The notification isn't obviously named. It says "Charging this device with USB, Tap for more optinos"
06:41:06 <borges[m]> I'm getting MTP now and have been able to complete the install.
06:42:53 <borges[m]> Thanks for walking me through it. Might be nice to add that to the FAQ or some wiki.
06:44:56 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> Hi, does anybody know why the proximity sensor on Pixel 5 lights up randomly when I lock/unlock the phone? Thanks in advance
06:45:24 <pizzaeater69[m]> <borges[m] "Thanks for walking me through it"> Fully agree, there should be more documentation on stuff like this so people would not have to ask here..
06:45:25 <zzxx123_> borges[m] that’s how stock Android works, not GOS specific
06:46:21 <borges[m]> zzxx123_: I believe it. And I don't think I've ever used Android in that way.
06:46:26 <strcat[m]> by using ADB you're making it harder to see the usual UI
06:47:26 <strcat[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2840804
06:47:29 <zzxx123_> borges[m] it’s a fact. And are you able to use MTP
06:47:43 <borges[m]> It wasn't hard to see, there were only 2 notifications on the screen. I've just never know that there was more to that notification because as I said it wasn't obvious to me that that's what I wanted
06:47:51 <zzxx123_> on owner, but don’t can’t one second user?
06:47:57 * strcat[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LlOyzaPmAVHKxNLljqwLvkNp/message.txt >
06:48:10 <strcat[m]> zzxx123_: it's identical on owner and secondary users
06:48:17 <strcat[m]> and it has to be explicitly enabled every time
06:48:41 <zzxx123_> Yes. And I don’t how he’s able to use it on owner, but not second user, since it’s the same
06:48:44 <strcat[m]> if you unplug the device and plug it in again, it's not trusted with access from the previous time
06:49:02 <zzxx123_> same steps to enable

07:44:30 <cream> Hello, I joined this application today.
07:44:30 <cream> If I turn off the computer, can I meet again tomorrow?
07:52:56 <nscnt[m]> cream: Yes. You can also connect to the room via Element/Matrix. I guess you'll have a more familiar user experience with that.
07:53:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> Is Vanadium secure against this?:https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-browser-attack-allows-tracking.html
07:55:06 <strcat[m]> Vanadium uses strict site isolation
07:55:12 <strcat[m]> sites need to be secure, of course
07:55:20 <strcat[m]> if the site is secure, then yes, it is secure against that
07:55:28 <strcat[m]> https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-post-spectre-webdev/
07:55:59 <strcat[m]> most sites are not secured at all against these attacks, unfortunately
08:27:11 <battlepad[m]> Hey lads, what is the recommended way to sideload signal onto grapheneOS? Should I grab the APK from the website or use aurora to grab it from the play store?
08:40:10 <COVID-1984> Any comments on what be cause being stuck in this sudden boot loop?
08:43:08 <akc3n[m]> <battlepad[m] "Hey lads, what is the recommende"> Use the official apk by downloading it while in Vanadium:
08:46:15 <COVID-1984> gonna try this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSD2f_d5OVQ
08:50:00 <COVID-1984> damn didn't work... I wonder if it is different if GOS is loaded because the bootloop only happens after about ~5s of the grapheneOS logo
08:50:19 <COVID-1984> and I see the grapheneOS logo get darker before it reboots

08:53:31 <battlepad[m]> Also sorry if this is unrelated, but how significant would be the tradeoff of using bromite instead of vanadium? I prefer bromite due to the built-in adblocker
08:54:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> @strcat thanks
08:55:13 <battlepad[m]> And I believe bromite does benefit from the vanadium webview since im using it on grapheneOS
08:57:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> @battlepad you can use Android's internal "private dns" feature and use dns Provider which block ads. i recommend NextDNS
08:57:19 <battlepad[m]> Oh im currently using blokada with AdguardDNS
08:57:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> you don't Need extra app. just enter the dns data in android
08:59:32 <battlepad[m]> yup ik, however i prefer blokada due to the blocklists included, as well as the full log included
09:04:08 <oligotrophia[m]> Question: The jntefrated AOSP keyboard is cool.
09:04:08 <oligotrophia[m]> Is it possiblento add language dictionaries for correction?
09:04:36 <akc3n[m]> <battlepad[m] "Also sorry if this is unrelated,"> Some insightful comments and info:
09:04:45 <oligotrophia[m]> Is it possible to add language dictionaries? I want to specifically add Russian for example.
09:04:49 <battlepad[m]> thanks, will give it a read
09:16:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> @battlepad dns Provider with account provide a log feature 😉
09:29:31 <battlepad[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<NorwegianFrost> @battlepad dns "> Oh I didn't know about that, sounds cool. will give it a try later
09:37:33 <akc3n[m]> <oligotrophia[m] "Is it possible to add language d"> Perhaps if you go to Settings, System, Languages & Input, then tap Add Language. Scroll down to Русский and add it.

10:11:13 <strcat[m]> Guest65023: likely an unreliable/broken USB cable/port
10:11:21 <strcat[m]> fastbootd isn't the end of the install
10:11:25 <strcat[m]> it's where it does most of it
10:12:25 <Guest65023> It throws me an error message on the PC when I get to the fastbootd screen on the device
10:12:53 <Guest65023> I have done everything according to the instructions. Everything is good until the flashing. The restarts occur. Then the last one happens and it gives me an error message about connections
10:16:35 <strcat[m]> very likely an unreliable USB connection
10:16:38 <strcat[m]> use a different USB port
10:16:43 <strcat[m]> use a different USB cable if that doesn't work
10:16:46 <strcat[m]> will likely solve the problem

10:36:32 <strcat[m]> Guest65023: probably USB issues, as said earlier
10:37:16 <strcat[m]> Guest65023: use a different computer or phone to perform the installation
10:39:44 <Guest65023> Thats what it seems to be .... I will try a different PC today. I appreciate all of the help that you have provided.
10:42:06 <FG[m]> I heard that there is an attack on smartphones where you extract encryption keys from memory when device in AFU. If this isnt how it works please correct me
10:42:06 <FG[m]> Could this happen in GrapheneOS
10:47:03 <strcat> FG[m]: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption before asking questions about it here
10:48:35 <rny> what is AFU

11:56:52 <COVID-1984> Right, tnx... I guess I have to try to fix the hardware because I need to recover files from it. And I suppose you cannot just take the SSD and put it in a new pixel.
11:57:30 <COVID-1984> Will continue trying the boot loop tricks online for the stock pixel 3a... However, I'm wondering if it could be anything GOS-specific, since it fails when it gets to teh grapheneOS screen for a while.

12:11:51 <jeff[m]1> I've no idea but the 3a XL received better reviews on battery life relative to other 3 series.
12:12:44 <jeff[m]1> the underlying problem with pixels is the lack of a replaceable battery, since the battery and screen are the two components that go fastest usually on phones
12:12:44 <pizzaeater69[m]> The recommended devices with the best hardware, firmware and software security along with the longest future support time are the Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5. We strongly recommend against purchasing older devices. The Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 will likely be supported for at least a bit longer than the Pixel 4a.

13:26:46 <dnull> Kaktus1: 30.0.5-6877874 https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
13:29:50 <wax> hi all ,   just trying my first attempt at installing graphene on a pixel 4a and have run into issues during the flash step,  can anyone help out please ?
13:31:15 <Kaktus1> I've seen that but when I use the command fastboot --version it returns: fastboot version 1:8.1.0+r23-5ubuntu2. I don't know if this is newer or older than the needed version 29.0.6
13:32:18 <dnull> Kaktus1: One way to find out.
13:43:57 <Kaktus1> dnull: what do you mean with one way to find out?
13:45:10 <dnull> Try it. If it works then it works, if not you'll know you need a different version.
13:45:14 <nscnt[m]> Kaktus1: What installation method do you use?
13:45:58 <nscnt[m]> Well, nvm
13:46:06 <nscnt[m]> nscnt: Follow https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#obtaining-fastboot
13:46:13 <nscnt[m]> * Kaktus1
13:46:21 <nscnt[m]>  * Kaktus1
13:46:41 <nscnt[m]> Ubuntu doesn't have a proper fastboot package
13:46:59 <nscnt[m]> So you'll need https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#standalone-platform-tools specifically
13:48:18 <nscnt[m]> Are you following the official guide at all? All questions you've asked are answered in the guide
13:51:13 <Kaktus1> i followed it step by step and then got stuck at flashing the image because the fastboot version is too old
13:51:37 <nscnt[m]> You've missed a lot, then
13:52:54 <nscnt[m]> You would have the correct version if you followed it correctly
14:13:06 <mynacol[m]> wax: Still having issues?
14:17:32 <wax> yes,
14:20:21 <nscnt[m]> wax: What operating system are you on? What installation method did you use and what problem did you experience?
14:20:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> According to someone I have heard in this group, for the best flashing quality you should update the factory OS first.
14:21:51 <visla[m]> It says to update the factory OS (for firmware) in the installation guide too.
14:23:38 <wax> using windows 10 /   the phone is a new pixel 4a / unlocked  /andriod 10 -   was going through the web install process -   unlocked bootloader, downloaded the OS zip,   did the flash,   locked bootloader,  tried to start -  says  no operating system
14:25:32 <nscnt[m]> wax: And you haven't encountered any errors in between?
14:28:24 <wax> no
14:28:54 <visla[m]> wax I don't know if this is the issue or makes a difference, but I just installed GOS on a new Pixel 4a earlier this week (which worked fine) and I was on fully updated Android 11 before starting.
14:29:43 <wax> so,  do i need to recover and update to 11 or something and start again ?
14:30:05 <nscnt[m]> wax: I would guess that you have interrupted the flashing process. You could just try to flash again from the beginning.
14:30:51 <nscnt[m]> wax: It would have been recommended, but you could just try from the beginning one more time.
14:33:39 <mynacol[m]> wax: Not updating the stock OS before flashing is no problem. The only problem it solves is not accidently flashing the firmware of another device and bricking it then. With the web installation method this won't happen.
14:34:03 <mynacol[m]> wax: Just retry flashing.
14:34:50 <mynacol[m]> wax: Guessing it is a USB issue, so you should switch USB ports and cables (the cable that came with the phone is fine).
14:40:15 <wax> ive retried flashing -  but wil ltry with a differetn port /  cable  and see what happens  -   (sorry if i take time to respond,  i'm having to work at the same time as doing this )
14:54:51 <wax> ok  so i changed the cable (same usb port still)   -  did the flash,   it goes through the process ,  takes me back to bootloader-
14:57:09 <wax> the web process screen  still says 'restarting device.  but the blue loader bar is 'full'    -     i do  'lock bootloader-   on the phone i now have the option to 'do not lock bootlader'  or  'lock bootloader'
14:57:12 <mynacol[m]> wax: For now don't lock the bootloader.
14:57:43 <mynacol[m]> wax: Just restart the phone and look if the boot works fine.
14:58:09 <mynacol[m]> *if booting works fine
14:59:42 <wax> ok,  pressed  'start'    -  breifly get the white google screen up,  then it goes back to bootloader -   messages at bottom say ' device state unlocked /  boot slot :b /  Enter reason : no valid slot to boot
14:59:53 <wax> boot slot b
15:00:06 <wax> not a smiley...
15:00:55 <mynacol[m]> wax: The install was  not successful.
15:01:15 <mynacol[m]> wax: If possible, try the install from another computer.
15:02:13 <mynacol[m]> wax: Many computer vendors do not implement the USB specification correctly, and when using fastboot those issues surface.
15:02:44 <wax> so start process again ?
15:03:31 <mynacol[m]> wax: Exactly.
15:04:15 <mynacol[m]> wax: Use the cable that came with the phone and switch computers if possible, or at least the USB port.
15:04:59 <mynacol[m]> wax: And any error message would be helpful. But sounds like you don't face any, so idk :/
15:05:03 <wax> when i click on the 'download release-  it says 'finding' and then 'downloaded'   fairly quickly - is that referring to the os.zip on my laptop  (or is it looking on the phone ?  )          -  is it worth trying to rename the zip so it has to download  the os again  ?

15:11:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Looping has joined the Telegram Group!
15:37:53 <wax> ok,   back after doing windwos updates (including the fastboot driver)  -  let's try again then
15:40:13 <wax> its doing a lot more 'unpacking' this time,  looking better so far
15:42:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <CryptGoat[m] "With that nickname, why would yo"> Because Ubuntu's Chromium builld is broken for flashing GrapheneOS on web
15:42:57 <CryptGoat[m]> yes, I corrected myself already
15:43:06 <CryptGoat[m]> sorry.
15:43:40 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's fine, just went back online and did not see the other messages earlier
15:51:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Hoo. That Windows Update sure is going to be fun.
15:52:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> About the Web Installer, what do the admins have most experience with? Debian or Ubuntu? (both latest)
15:53:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Why so
15:54:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> There is a fuzz about some of the recent Windows 10 Updates forcing Edge into the users. Everyone is raging over it.
15:54:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Off-topic.
15:54:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Totally logical
15:54:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> We only support the new edge for flashing grapheneos fyi
15:55:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> The older non chromium edge isn't supported
15:55:19 <wax> ok,  after a few more errors, it has now booted up into GrapheneOs  -  although i'm not sure bootloader is locked again yet ?    shall i just go through setup process first whilst it's loaded   ?
15:56:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Hm.Just noticed the update was from the past year.
15:56:23 <dnull> wax: You can lock the bootloader after it finishes booting
15:56:33 <pizzaeater69[m]> <wax "ok,  after a few more errors, it"> Make sure bootloader is locked before using it.
15:57:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Well if you're that behind on updates you're doing something wrong
15:57:37 <wax> so, OS  is basic setup now -     do i need to reboot phone into bootloader mode to then lock it ?
15:57:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> No, I am behind on OSs in general.Me, my mom and my dad use Windows 7 to 8.1. None of ua have Windows 10 so I must get the latest Debian in order to flash GOS.
15:58:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Though I do wonder if there is support with ungoogled-chromium 70.
15:59:02 <mynacol[m]> wax: Exactly. The bootloader will say if it is locked or not. If not, lock it via the web installer
15:59:05 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <wax "so, OS  is basic setup now -    "> Yeah
15:59:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> The bootloader must be locked in order to add security.
16:00:48 <mynacol[m]> wax: If on system startup your phone says "Booting another operating system" the install is complete and the bootloader is locked.
16:02:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I do wonder if the system shoots a warning when the Android Verified Boot Key does not match with the OS.
16:03:26 <pizzaeater69[m]> https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/boot-flow
16:04:05 <wax> ok,  so li locked the bootloader,  and now it won't start up -   'can't find valid operating system'
16:04:23 * pizzaeater69[m] uploaded an image: (31KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ELAbxGaMrtEkezXXxEjVlwPg/boot_red1.png >
16:04:35 <wax> won't power off
16:04:41 <PNDMT12345[m]> I have a question. When we give File access to any app, can the app read all other folders in the File app? If yes, how to restrict it?
16:05:25 <wax> i can get back into bootloader menu  -   current state is locked
16:06:12 <mynacol[m]> wax: The installation was not 100% successful.
16:06:17 <pizzaeater69[m]> Unlock it and try to install again
16:06:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> So THAT'S the answer to my question.
16:07:16 <wax> did  'unlock'  via web install page -  web page says 'unlocked'  ,  but  phone is showing me the 'do not unlock bootlocker ' option  -  do i need to select  'unlock' on the phone now
16:07:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> If the web installer threw errors then locking the bootloader isn't what you should do
16:08:06 <mynacol[m]> wax: Press one of the volume keys. Then you should be able to 'unlock bootloader'
16:08:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Use the volume button to change the options
16:08:15 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Boy is this going to be fun when I get my Pixel considering my lousy Internet connection.I think I must not use VPN in the process then.
16:08:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> Use power to confirm
16:08:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> And reflash
16:08:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> VPN is fine
16:08:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> But flashing on windows 7/8.1 isn't tested
16:08:54 <mynacol[m]> @g​ochoingles The download is almost never the problem.
16:09:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> And flashing on Linux can be a pain due to poor usb support in general
16:09:08 <visla[m]> This is like a soap opera - I'm invested in this story!
16:09:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Free plan. Not a great idea.ProtonVPN by the way. Really trustworthy when it comes to hiding your IP and that stuff.
16:09:51 * dnull offers visla[m] popcorn
16:10:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> That is why I am going to get Debian. Surely going to work since it installs like a million non-free packages.
16:10:50 <visla[m]> Yum
16:11:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> The best part is that it is not based on anything unlike Ubuntu so it surely must be more stable.
16:12:53 <mynacol[m]> @g​ochoingles You do know Ubuntu is based on Debian?
16:13:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Yes. That is the point.Ubuntu is based off of Debian.Debian is not based on anything as far as I know. It is GNU/Linux though.

16:19:34 <wax> ok,    so it seems that i can start graphene if bootloader is unlocked -  as soon as it;s locked it says 'unable to find valid operating system' -    then if i reflash ,  it briefly does some unpacking , and then the restarting device bar   fills  -    phone is showing  'fastboot mode'   -  with device state unlocked
16:20:54 <mynacol[m]> wax: That sounds too fast. The main installation step should take 1-3 minutes
16:22:11 <wax> it did take a few mins before -   like this it will boot into graphene (back to setup status) -   i can go thru setup -  and end up with the basic os and a few app icons
16:23:41 <wax> but as far as i know  bootloader is unlocked -     if i power off phone and go into bootloader, i can lock it,  but then the phone will not boot
16:24:14 <nscnt[m]> wax: Locking the bootloader is an important step. Don't skip this.
16:25:07 <mynacol[m]> wax: Maybe try restarting computer and phone and try again.
16:25:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> It annoys me how you people can download a 1 GB file in minutes while I take about 5 hours to get 1 GB downloaded.100 kbps if you are wondering.
16:29:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Sad
16:29:30 <wax> ok,  so quick question-  when the 'flash' process is  saying   'restarting device'  with full blue bar,  and the phone is showing  'fastboot mode'   unlocked  -  witrh the option to press 'start'  -  do i then do  'lock bootloader'  from web page ?
16:30:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> If thats the last step you haven't done then yes
16:32:37 <wax> if i do that,  webpage sets to  'device locked'  ,  does a bit of  'radio loading' in the  'flash'  section,   then  says   'error the device was disconnected'    (it hasn't been)  -  and on th ephoen i get bootloader  with the  'do not lock the bootloader' option
16:33:22 <wax> so i then select the  'lock the bootloader option'  on the phone
16:33:58 <wax> it comes back to  fastboot mode  -    with  device status  'locked'
16:34:45 <wax> press 'start'  and get  'can't find valid operating system - device will not start' message
16:35:33 <wax> all i can then do is force it back into  bootloader mode on phone
16:37:30 <wax> will try a reboot of laptop again and see what happens after that
16:38:40 <AppAraat[m]> Does AuroraStore work for you guys or nah?
16:39:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Aurora work but the apps inside are not guaranteed to
16:39:24 <zzxx123_> Use Aurora v4
16:40:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> Is it out yet ? (As non beta)
16:40:26 <zzxx123_> Still in beta, already more stable than v3
16:42:32 <mynacol[m]> wax: If you cannot boot with locked bootloader, the installation did not complete successfully. Even if it boots and seems to work fine.
16:48:04 <AppAraat[m]> <zzxx123_ "Use Aurora v4"> If I install v4, would I need to re-install the apps installed by v3?
16:49:32 <mynacol[m]> AppAraat: Please move discussions not directly related with Graphene to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org . I will answer you there.
16:52:00 <AppAraat[m]> oh, my apologies.
16:54:47 <wax> ok,   pc rebooted again -   started flash process again -   unpacking & stuff going on -  back in a few mins
17:04:47 <wax> ok,   flash section now saying 'Flashed sunfish-factory-2021.03.06.00.zip to device.'   -  so looking better this time
17:06:12 <wax> so, (stupid question #23432525)  do i now click the 'lock bootloader. button on webpage ?
17:06:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lock it
17:07:02 <wax> so,  done that -  webpage  says  'Bootloader Locked'
17:07:41 <wax> phone now hs option  'do no lock the bootloader'  selecgted-   i guess i want to select  'lock'  on the phone too  now
17:08:08 <COVID-1984> when mounting with simple-mtpfs & then cp -r /media/Pixel/ ./ -- it seems nothing is copying. But the dir size as reported by du -sh seems to be increasing...
17:08:21 <COVID-1984> maybe the files don't appear until 'cp -r' is done
17:09:31 <nscnt[m]> wax: yes
17:10:34 <wax> ok,  i think i am finally there -      just loading graphene now -    THANKYOU   for helping out a 'de-googlifying noob' out
17:12:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Degoogle is just a buzzword
17:12:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sure we go out of our way to not include Google apps
17:13:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> But stuff like connectivity check should still use Google to blend in
17:13:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your carrier might also use Google servers for various services
17:13:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have supl.google.com for instance
17:14:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway connectivity check does have an option in the settings and you can switch to the grapheneos servers
17:14:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do note that is a little bad if you want to blend in
17:16:48 <wax> ok ----- i am making the leap across from using apple shit for years - have some experience of androids,  but  have a lot to learn still -
17:18:03 <pizzaeater69[m]> Well here you have community to support you:) and not some Apple customer service bot xd
17:22:57 <fretegi> anupritaisno1[m], is the best practice to use the graphene servers?
17:24:41 <fretegi> i assume graphene, which is what i have set as well
17:29:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Best to use Google but just my thoughts
17:29:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll be able to blend in more with Google's servers
17:30:38 <fretegi> i gotcha, be part of the crowd
17:30:50 <MrNewbie72> Is chance grapheneos going to be supported on fxtec pro
17:31:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
17:32:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are not even going to consider devices like fxtech

17:33:22 <TheJollyRoger> MrNewbie72: other vendors either do not provide support for or are actively hostile to operating systems that are not their own.
17:33:50 <TheJollyRoger> MrNewbie72: for instance, most of them except for Google will disable important security features on the phone if you don't run the operating system that isn't theirs.
17:34:12 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung will go so far as to burn out an E Fuse that will even disable them.

20:24:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> The question is : standing out to who ? Who is watching you ? If you just want to keep google out then don't use their service and they won't see you. If its a national agency then your problems are most likely bigger and google or not you are probably being watched no matter what. Unless you use tor exensively and so on
20:25:13 <akc3n[m]> * https://protonapps.com/
20:25:13 <akc3n[m]> Download the APK then install
20:26:54 <IRCX6[m]> Also its up to you but Protonmail can also provide IP logging.Your Sign up requires identifiable information for example the sign up requires your Phone number, Real IP address(as they block VPN IP addresses) , or a Bitcoin Donation
20:27:10 <wax88> thankyou  !     i've just installed grapheneos   and am moving over from years of iphone  with some android knowledge,  ,  so massive learning curve today

20:30:02 <IRCX6[m]> That email address you just created through Pm is identifiable
20:31:00 <IRCX6[m]> That IP address you have comes from a ISP provider and what does your ISP provider have your identity
20:31:25 <IRCX6[m]> A Phone number being identifiable to you is already self explanatory

21:01:26 <ainsley> I'm having a strange issue with multiple profiles. Whenever I play a video via any web browser or newpipe my screen immediately locks. The video continues to play in the background. Unlocking brings me back but it immediately locks again unless I quickly switch to another app/homescreen. This does not happen on the owner profile. Any ideas?
21:01:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Must I have my Android 10 Go version updated for the Web Installer?
21:01:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <c​lannad> You should install any updates first
21:02:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Can I use this thing...um, Samsung Galaxy A01 Core?
21:02:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> As the installation assistant or whatever the device that is installing is called?
21:05:36 <ainsley> Ive tried multiple websites, multiple browsers and different profiles. Only exception appears to be the owner profile.
21:06:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> ainsley: what is your grapheneos version
21:08:02 <ainsley> where can I check? Just installed last week.
21:09:19 <ainsley> About phone is showing build number rq2a.210305.006.2021.03.06.00
21:09:55 <akc3n[m]> Settings -> About Phone
21:10:46 <ainsley> I'm only seeing build number. Is there another version number I should be seeing? This is on a pixel 4a btw
21:12:19 <akc3n[m]> <ainsley "I'm only seeing build number. Is"> They are the same thing.
21:12:41 <ainsley> Oh ok
21:14:14 <nscnt[m]> I can't reproduce it
21:14:29 <nscnt[m]> ainsley: Any steps with which I could?
21:16:59 <ainsley> Heres how I'm doing it. In any secondary profile open bromite. Play random video off youtube home page.
21:17:37 <ainsley> Pretty simple. Must be something specific that I did or it would be happening to everyone
21:18:25 <ainsley> Maybe I have to just factory reset and install to see if it persists
21:18:26 <nscnt[m]> Does it happen with Vanadium, too? There are different versions one could have for Bromite etc.
21:18:28 <akc3n[m]> Works fine for me in Bromite.
21:20:32 <ainsley> Yeah just tried vanadium again. Same thing
21:21:37 <ainsley> I'll try resetting and report back. So frustrating and random.
21:22:04 <PNDMT12345[m]> <akc3n[m] "https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> Thanks a lot. It clears all my concerns
21:22:20 <ainsley> Thanks for verifying for me
22:15:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Web Install says between the compatible devices"Google Android on GrapheneOS-supported devices".Do I need another Google Pixel?
22:22:06 <akc3n[m]> <PNDMT12345[m] "Thanks a lot. It clears all my c"> Glad to hear.
22:22:06 <nscnt[m]> It has been tested on GrapheneOS supported devices (i.e. the supported Pixel devices) and therefore they are considered officially supported for the WebUSB-based installer. Other devices might work, but we don't officially support them. It's at your own risk.
22:25:08 <zh35hi[m]> How long you think it will take to get the dedicate GrapheneOS release for Pixel 5?
22:25:38 <dnull> zh35hi[m]: I'm running GOS on a Pixel5 right now.
22:25:41 <timetravelingman> There already is
22:26:05 <akc3n[m]> <zh35hi[m] "How long you think it will take "> It has been already released.
22:26:13 <dnull> Oh, and I switched to it to post this.
22:27:42 <zh35hi[m]> <dnull "zh35hi: I'm running GOS on a Pix"> *5A :)

22:28:14 <zh35hi[m]> Thank akc3n. I missed a vowel
22:31:16 <akc3n[m]> zh35hi  GOS release dates with that of Pixel device release dates to get rough idea.
22:31:17 <akc3n[m]> https://endoflife.date/pixel
22:31:27 <akc3n[m]> * zh35hi compare GOS release dates with that of Pixel device release dates to get rough idea.

22:52:03 <Citizen528[m]> Can anyone confirm if the Microsoft SwiftKey keyboard will run on grapheneos? I understand it requires play services but I've got it working on other rooms just fine. Just wondering if it works on graphene as well.

23:02:10 <Thatcher[m]> In GrapheneOS, I was just browsing around in Files with Hidden Items showing and found some folders called .aux mainly in my DCIM directory and the .aux folders had remnants of pictures I had deleted back since when I first started using Graphene in early December. Anyone know what .aux is? I can't seem to find any information about it. Thanks

23:09:35 <Thatcher[m]> <dnull "Thatcher: Why are you spamming t"> Does editing count as spamming?
23:09:37 <dnull> Any of the Ops?
23:09:42 <dnull> Yes
23:09:51 <dnull> You've posted like 5 times now
23:10:01 <Thatcher[m]> Oops, sorry. My bad
23:10:16 <dnull> Yes
23:10:18 <Thatcher[m]> I've edited 5 times
23:10:19 <dnull> Yes it was.
23:10:25 <dnull> 5 times it was.
23:10:51 <Thatcher[m]> I didn't know editing was considered spamming
23:11:14 <dnull> You filled up my screen, and half again
23:11:19 <dnull> How is that not spam?
23:11:39 <Thatcher[m]> Well, I apologize for ruining your day
23:11:55 <Thatcher[m]> Won't happen again
23:11:57 <akc3n[m]> I fix spelling or grammatical errors all the time. I had no idea that would be considered spamming. Thanks for pointing that out then.
23:13:15 <dnull> akc3n[m]: If you flood the channel with your corrections with no usefulness other than wanting to spell things right, it's spam.
23:14:47 <Thatcher[m]> Thanks for pointing that out. Didn't know.
23:14:54 <akc3n[m]> <dnull "akc3n: If you flood the channel "> Gotcha.
23:16:16 <Thatcher[m]> Thanks for addressing the issue with extreme sarcasn though. Really helped to get the message across.
23:16:49 <Thatcher[m]> I'm afraid to edit 'sarcasn' now

23:18:14 <dnull> It wasn't sarcasm
23:18:30 <dnull> Just stating things.
23:18:50 <Thatcher[m]> Have a nice weekend buddy
23:19:05 <dnull> Ok
23:19:25 <ingtarsredemptio> Does anyone else have an issue with "Dark theme" and "Night light" features (in display settings) on Grapheneos when using a sunrise/sunset schedule? (with location services enabled)
23:19:25 <ingtarsredemptio> Does not seem to work

23:21:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Hey guys,anyone with the snall pixel 4? Do you haveany major bugs with Graphene, do you have VoLTE working? Thanks, I consider one just for Graphene
23:23:01 <lodtank> small pixel4? pixel4a? have it running here, no idea about volte
23:23:13 <bearsecures[m]> @Six557 not at all? 4a non xl version

23:23:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Just Pixel 4, not the 4a.
23:23:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> The metal 4
23:24:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> I need VoLTE othrrwise its a brick in my country.... Is it working on Graphene?
23:24:57 <dnull> GrapheneOS-Teleg: Yep
23:25:10 <mynacol[m]> @Six557 Please consider getting a 4a instead https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
23:26:35 <mynacol[m]> @Six557 And VoLTE is highly carrier dependent. For me it works just fine, but depends on your carrier. Which is it?
23:33:13 <strcat> Thatcher[m]: you're using an app like the gallery app using a .aux directory for past edits of images
23:33:20 <strcat> Thatcher[m]: not an OS thing, it's an app thing
23:40:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​ix557> Interesting. The 4 is really cheap now though at 250$

23:55:18 <AdamsBrother1636> Hi
23:55:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Probably a review or something.
23:55:25 <AdamsBrother1636> Donate to Graphene OS!
23:55:36 <mynacol[m]> <zh35hi[m] "Any recent video review of Graph"> If possible try it yourself. BTW Graphene is mostly the AOSP experience. The Graphene specific parts are explained on the website. And this chat and #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org will answer all remaining questions.
23:56:04 <AdamsBrother1636> AOSP + Security Hardening = GOS
23:56:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> You could just search it up on NewPipe.
23:57:27 <zh35hi[m]> <mynacol[m] "If possible try it yourself. BTW"> Sure, that would be the most desirable thing; but nothing I can do, at this very moment ^^
