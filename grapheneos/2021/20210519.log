05:26:10 <lackshan[m]> dithher It doesn't. The solution is to not use traditional calls and SMS
05:26:31 <lackshan[m]> Use  signal/matrix insteas

08:16:27 <Tristan[m]1> Hello! I'm planning to switch to GrapheneOS, and might be buying a Pixel 5 soon!
08:16:27 <Tristan[m]1> Is there any compatibility issue with the Japanese version of the Pixel 5 (G5NZ6), or is any version of the phone compatible? I'm having a hard time finding the differences between the versions.
08:18:17 <strcat[m]> no compatibility issues with different variants
08:18:33 <strcat[m]> the only issue is if you get one locked down by a carrier without OEM unlocking toggle available
08:18:55 <strcat[m]> the variants exist due to minor, optional radio differences
08:19:03 <strcat[m]> and different regulations for radio
08:19:28 <strcat[m]> you can use any variant in any part of the world but sometimes at a network speed / availability cost (generally minor, if at all)(
08:19:40 <strcat[m]>  * you can use any variant in any part of the world but sometimes at a network speed / availability cost (generally minor, if at all)
08:24:39 <Tristan[m]1> Thanks for the really quick reply! Using a phone in Japan that was not certified for Japan is technically illegal (even if there is no check for that). So I will try to stick with the Japanese version if I can. I will need to get information about the OEM unlocking, but I'm a bit worry, because Japanese carrier usually lock everything they can (sometimes even locking some feature of the phone, to make you pay to use
08:24:39 <Tristan[m]1> it)
08:26:09 <Tristan[m]1> Anyway, it is good to know that the variants are almost the same. I know for example that the Galaxy S7 had a different CPU architecture for the Japanese variant :/
08:33:31 <strcat[m]> it's more that Samsung prefers using Exynos but their radio is lackluster particularly when it comes to supporting legacy nonsense so they use Snapdragon in some regions (primarily the US) to work around it
08:33:42 <strcat[m]> could also be somewhat tied to US patent law
08:34:01 <strcat[m]> I think they'll likely just end up using their own SoC in the future
08:34:15 <strcat[m]>  * I think they'll likely just end up using their own SoCs everywhere in the future

09:26:07 <vdh7[m]> I'm not sure buying the Pixel 5 at this stage of the release cycle effective is cost-effective. Plus seems like the pixel 5a will be available in Japan.
09:26:27 <vdh7[m]> minus "effective" (first one)
09:27:35 <vdh7[m]> ofc if budget is not a concern you can do as you like
09:41:57 <mederic[m]> New user of GrapheneOS on a Pixel 5... GrapheneOS is easily the most satisfying custom ROM experience I ever had :)
09:42:18 <GhostSplinterSix> <mederic[m] "New user of GrapheneOS on a Pixe"> I'm glad to hear it!
09:43:13 <GhostSplinterSix> <vdh7[m] "> <@tristan-042:matrix.org> Hell"> The 5 will be supported until October of 2023, so there's plenty of time to get use out of it.
09:44:09 <mederic[m]> GhostSplinterSix: you're one of the developpers ?
09:45:07 <GhostSplinterSix> <mederic[m] "GhostSplinterSix: you're one of "> Hah, naw.
09:45:57 <mederic[m]> Okay, you are well informed then :) i'm glad to have learned the support duration of the Pixel 5
09:47:21 <vdh7[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "The 5 will be supported until Oc"> sure I'm just saying that the price might drop once 5a/6 are out.  700 for 2 years might be steep for some people
09:51:39 <GhostSplinterSix> <mederic[m] "Okay, you are well informed then"> I try to learn what I can about the OS.
09:52:20 <GhostSplinterSix> <vdh7[m] "sure I'm just saying that the pr"> Oh, I know. I was just stating the support information in case you weren't aware.
09:58:30 <vdh7[m]> GhostSplinterSix: ah yeah I'm aware. my point was just that if he buys 4a now he only misses a few months of support for much cheaper, and if he waits for 5a/6 he will get the full 3 years (or maybe more?) which in both cases will be better cost/year than buying the 5 now
10:05:25 <GhostSplinterSix> <vdh7[m] "GhostSplinterSix: ah yeah I'm aw"> I understand your point. The 4a 5G's support ends a month after the 5 which I wasn't aware of until recently.
10:06:43 <GhostSplinterSix> Anyways, this is considered an off-topic discussion, so we should move to that room if we want to continue it.

10:53:01 <stubbornant[m]> Hi, I have seen the reddit post mentioning a new upgrade
10:53:12 <stubbornant[m]> I cannot see it on my phone
10:53:21 <stubbornant[m]> I have a 4a
10:55:02 <helloworldkk87[m> Im pretty sure its in Beta still. Not sure tho
10:58:41 <man[m]> Its in Beta.
10:58:53 <stubbornant[m]> Ok so I will see it when it goes in alpha?
10:59:48 <man[m]> Yeah GrapheneOS if i remember correctly checks every 4 hours for an update
11:00:05 <helloworldkk87[m> When it comes to stable you can download and install it yes. Also check out:  https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
12:43:02 <yodawins[m]> With the risk of going offtopic; GrapheneOS makes me horney, is that supposed to be normal?
12:43:22 <KennyWalther[m]> <yodawins[m] "With the risk of going offtopic;"> Wtf? 😂
12:44:14 <Railgun_Lover[m]> yodawins: well, I can understand, the OS is so beautiful and well put together that some may get horny from it
12:44:42 <GhostSplinterSix> I'm not even going to ask...
12:45:03 <KennyWalther[m]> Kinda start to loose fainth in humanity
12:45:17 <KennyWalther[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I'm not even going to ask..."> Better
12:45:27 <Railgun_Lover[m]> <KennyWalther[m] "Wtf? 😂"> Jokes aside, yes
12:45:31 <Railgun_Lover[m]> Wtf
13:01:51 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Lmao wat
13:02:25 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <helloworldkk87[m "Im pretty sure its in Beta still"> The new release may be the one that'll move to stable (since there is a new build done just recently for next release)
13:44:01 <helloworldkk87[m> <yodawins[m] "With the risk of going offtopic;"> Well yeah its a beautiful OS cant blame you
13:49:59 <entry1> Dumb question. I'm getting texts while still in airplane mode. Is this because I have WiFi calling or something on?
13:50:04 <GhostSplinterSix> <helloworldkk87[m "Well yeah its a beautiful OS can"> Please don't revive this...
13:50:12 <entry1> I can't send, but I'm receiving.
13:54:57 <GhostSplinterSix> <entry1 "Dumb question. I'm getting texts"> Enabling airplane mode disables the cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device.
13:55:50 <hypokeimenon[m]> Open source projects not using misleading marketing or information tactics when? Isn't that a meme? I feel like someone left a comment like that on the issue tracker and strcpy made it funnier
14:01:36 <entry1> > <@ghostsplintersix:matrix.org> Enabling airplane mode disables the cellular radio, but Wi-Fi can be re-enabled and used without activating the cellular radio again. This allows using the device as a Wi-Fi only device.
14:01:36 <entry1> > https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
14:01:36 <entry1> Oh yeah, I use airplane mode all the time with WiFi enabled. I received texts while in Airplane mode though. Unsure if this is due to a severe delay (hour or more since the airplane mode was activated) or if it is due to something else.
14:04:05 <GhostSplinterSix> Were you ever out of range of your WiFi and did these messages come once you were within range?
14:16:26 <strcat[m]> deciding on what we need to do about the freenode stuff
14:16:46 <strcat[m]> it's possible we'll just switch fully to Matrix and we'll need to redo the Telegram bridge as being hooked up the Matrix channel, which will make it work better since it can send longer messages
14:16:57 <strcat[m]> I don't know how to disconnect the IRC bridge from this room
14:17:12 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <hypokeimenon[m] "Open source projects not using m"> It's hard to tell at plain sight, haha
14:17:55 <strcat[m]> Matrix is problematic too
14:18:11 <strcat[m]> it has really bad anti-abuse mechanisms and the room upgrade problem is really bad
14:18:18 <strcat[m]> the IRC bridge is a major source of issues for Matrix
14:18:28 <strcat[m]> it might make sense to just make an entirely new Matrix room and migrate this one to there
14:18:29 <strcat[m]> sigh
14:21:42 <strcat[m]> I think maybe we should just make an entirely fresh Matrix room and migrate there
14:21:46 <strcat[m]> and eventually set a tombstone here manually
14:21:58 <strcat[m]> this room is v1
14:22:19 <strcat[m]> I don't like the official room upgrade mechanism
14:22:32 <strcat[m]> we'll lose even more users than we do from the IRC bridge idle kicks
14:23:10 <GhostSplinterSix> I support whatever y'all decide. I enjoy this community.
14:23:30 <entry1> <GhostSplinterSix "Were you ever out of range of yo"> I thought the cellular radio was disabled fully in airplane mode, which would not allow cellular service at all, WiFi enabled or not, and no texts could be received.
14:24:12 <strcat[m]> currently my thinking is we should make a new Matrix room and migrate there, move the aliases over to it
14:24:16 <strcat[m]> and bridge the Telegram room to that rather than IRC
14:24:33 <strcat[m]> if we do decide to make an IRC bridge again, it can't be this garbage matrix.org IRC bridge
14:24:37 <strcat[m]> which kicks users who don't speak for 30 days
14:24:38 <strcat[m]> that sucks
14:24:41 <strcat[m]> I want the auto kicking to stop
14:24:49 <GhostSplinterSix> Sounds good to me. 🤜🏻🤛🏻
14:24:57 <strcat[m]> anyway I'll probably just make a new room now and start migrating
14:25:02 <strcat[m]> sorry for the nonsense
14:25:09 <strcat[m]> https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27207440
14:25:24 <GhostSplinterSix> There's no need to apologize, my friend.
14:25:31 <strcat[m]> freenode got taken over by the guy who owns PIA and basically the entire staff is resigning
14:25:43 <strcat[m]> this room is essentially controlled from the IRC side via the bridge
14:25:47 <strcat[m]> I don't even know how to turn off the bridge
14:25:49 <GhostSplinterSix> Oof...
14:25:51 <strcat[m]> I don't know if we can
14:25:56 <strcat[m]> Matrix is so broken, so is IRC
14:28:31 <Wonderfall[m]> Unfortunate
14:30:45 <strcat[m]> anyone have thoughts?
14:31:03 <strcat[m]> we could always just leave things as they are but I don't like people being kicked for not speaking for 30 days in the Matrix room anyway
14:31:08 <strcat[m]> and it needs an upgrade from v1 anyway
14:31:15 <strcat[m]> so there has to be a painful migration regardless
14:31:28 <Wonderfall[m]> Personally I'd just make a new Matrix room
14:31:43 <strcat[m]> I don't really want to move to oftc or the new network from the freenode staff because we lose the network effects of freenode so why not just use Matrix?
14:32:23 <GhostSplinterSix> Makes sense
14:33:19 <strcat> jess directly helped us with freenode admin stuff on the IRC side
14:33:28 <strcat> she's one of the people who resigned
14:33:41 <strcat> I really don't know what's going to happen to freenode but the main staff quit
14:33:57 <strcat> it's possible the takeover will stop and it will go back to them, who knows, but they don't own freenode.net
14:34:15 <jpds> Bunch of projects have already moved over to OFTC
14:35:47 <GhostSplinterSix> Yeah...if that many people resigned, it's a sign that whatever happened is no bueno.
14:36:21 <strcat[m]> yeah I don't see the point of moving though
14:36:31 <strcat[m]> it's easier to move to Matrix
16:06:40 <globbot> channel logging requested by strcat: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
16:07:09 <strcat> inviting back the bot since kicking it removed the old logs
16:07:17 <strcat> this restores it
16:08:59 <Rusty[m]> I read about some big problem with freenode, can I ask why are you moving there?
16:09:16 <strcat[m]> we aren't moving to Freenode
16:09:18 <strcat[m]> we're moving away from it
16:09:33 <strcat[m]> Rusty: please join #grapheneos:matrix.org / #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org, the new Matrix rooms
16:09:38 <Rusty[m]> Yeah, I'm stupid, sorry
16:09:47 <Rusty[m]> I read better now, thanks
16:09:51 <strcat[m]> this room was the standard bridged room to freenode
16:09:56 <strcat[m]> and also it's version 1
16:10:06 <strcat[m]> new room is version 6 (current)
16:37:21 <strcat[m]> @room please join #grapheneos:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org, we're replacing the old rooms
16:40:43 <DarkUranium> Well.
16:40:58 <DarkUranium> I'm not going to be joining the project on Matrix, so --- so long, then.
16:41:39 <strcat> DarkUranium: irc channel isn't going away yet
16:42:02 <strcat> will remain here for the time being, in theory we could make an irc channel elsewhere
16:42:16 <strcat> but we can't use the same bridge approach
16:43:35 <TheJollyRoger> We could move to OFTC...?
16:43:51 <strcat> better to get as many people as possible on Matrix 1st
16:44:00 <strcat> and then consider if we need to move the IRC channel elsewhere
16:44:16 <strcat> freenode is no longer going to have network effects that are positive anyway
16:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir.
16:49:09 <DarkUranium> There's also Libera.
16:49:48 <strcat[m]> yes but what if the same thing happens to oftc or freenode
16:49:58 <strcat[m]> shrug
16:50:21 <strcat[m]> at least here we'll be able to put a tombstone in the dead room and migrate most people over to a new room, and the room isn't tied to matrix.org
16:50:38 <DarkUranium> strcat[m], I mean, by that logic --- what if the same thing happens to Matrix?
16:50:47 <DarkUranium> (which is *WAY* more centralized than IRC --- not in theory, but it is in practice)
16:51:09 <strcat[m]> DarkUranium: our room isn't owned by matrix.org
16:51:17 <strcat[m]> we can switch to accounts elsewhere and keep the rooms
16:51:21 <strcat[m]> and just transfer over admin
16:51:53 <strcat[m]> https://matrix.org/foundation/
16:52:12 <strcat[m]> it's also not just owned by some random person, not sure how that happens
16:52:18 <DarkUranium> strcat[m], like I said: "not in theory, but it is in practice"
16:52:18 <strcat[m]> the crown prince of korea owns freenode
16:52:19 <strcat[m]> lol
16:52:43 <DarkUranium> I mean, #grapheneos isn't owned by anyone on other IRC networks either, so I'm a bit confused how that would compare.
16:53:57 <strcat[m]> the irc server owns the channels
16:54:13 <strcat[m]> freenode controls this irc channel, and through the matrix bridge, they control this matrix room
16:54:21 <dazinism> On matrix rooms don't live on a server
16:54:27 <strcat[m]> because the bridge bot is subservient to IRC and has to be an admin
16:54:38 <strcat[m]> yeah, matrix rooms aren't tied to a specific server
16:54:42 <strcat[m]> this isn't a matrix.org room
16:54:54 <dazinism> They exist on every server which has a user in the room
16:54:55 <strcat[m]> the moderators just mostly have matrix.org accounts but I could switch to an account elsewhere, make it an admin, and drop this one as admin
16:55:08 <strcat[m]> and matrix.org has no more control once there isn't an admin with a matrix.org account
16:57:16 <dazinism> If the matrix.org server goes down, temporarily or permanently everyone else on different servers can carry on chatting fine
18:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> I'm... I'm going to miss this place.
18:08:29 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: did you see https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1395059076464144389

19:14:07 <strcat> please join #grapheneos:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org via a Matrix client like Element
20:53:09 <Baloo> shame that it is totally matrix now, I was one of the few users it seems who solely used IRC.
20:57:04 <strcat[m]> Baloo: we'll consider making an IRC channel elsewhere and using some kind of bridge
20:57:11 <strcat[m]> but the prior bridge approach was really problematic on the Matrix side
20:57:15 <strcat[m]> for now it's just Matrix
20:57:39 <Baloo> Gotcha, saw that you have a backup channel on OFTC, looking forward to wherever the community lands on IRC next.
20:58:09 <strcat[m]> the IRC channel will still be on freenode but it will stay bridged only to this legacy Matrix room
20:58:15 <strcat[m]> so most of the community will be gone from here
20:58:44 <strcat[m]> we'll figure out whether we need to make a new IRC channel elsewhere and how to bridge it (since the standard Matrix irc bridge is very problematic) if we do
20:59:02 <alex-resist> Not that it matters much but I'm also one of the folks who would rather stay on IRC. New matrix room + new bridge would of course be fine with me
21:09:06 <alex-resist> Btw I was trying out Android 12 today and I was surprised how bloated stock Android is, even without third party apps. I'm really thankful for the clean & minimal approach GrapheneOS takes
21:21:54 <TheJollyRoger> I would also love to stay with IRC, if at all possible.
21:22:27 <strcat> we'd need to pick a new irc server and then figure out a way to bridge it
21:22:35 <strcat> Element is a lot better than it used to be fwiw
21:22:51 <TheJollyRoger> That's good to hear.
21:22:56 <TheJollyRoger> Captain, message?
21:34:16 <CaptainPicard[m]> What's up?
21:34:17 <CaptainPicard[m]> Do you mean me?
21:35:23 <Dylanger[m]> `/part`
21:35:50 <strcat[m]> CaptainPicard: no he meant me
21:36:40 <CaptainPicard[m]> Sorry my b
21:37:47 <strcat[m]> @room please migrate to the new channels #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (the old aliases without -new were also moved to the new channels, but some home servers seem to cache those...)
21:44:52 <TheJollyRoger> CaptainPicard[m]: ah sorry about that, I address strcat (or the owner of a project, if I'm in their channel) as either "sir" or "Captain" since I'm big on gimmicks.
21:45:28 <CaptainPicard[m]> No worries. I figured. Just wanted to make sure it was clear I wasn't ignoring if you were trying to reach me.
21:46:06 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, of course! :)
21:56:22 <strcat> owl: can you give me op on libera.chat? /op strcat
21:56:26 <strcat> just want to reserve channel there
21:56:44 <strcat> also snoopy for #grapheneos-offtopic there
22:02:12 <snoopy> strcat: already done
22:11:46 <owl> strcat: definitely. I was just squatting there until one of you guys arrived.
22:12:00 <TheJollyRoger> owl: Oh hey that's you over there?
22:12:15 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks for keeping an eye on it!
22:12:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> On my pixel 5, my finger print scanner has wiped the enrolled fingerprints on some of the profiles, and I can't re-enrol them? Any ideas?
22:13:49 <owl> TheJollyRoger: yes sir. I can hand things over whenever you'd like.
22:14:24 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. As long as strcat has control he should be able to handle the rest! Thank you!
22:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> @L73689 - that's bizarre, I've never heard about that happening before o.O.
22:15:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Yeah it's totally out of character , I just noticed one of my profiles wasn't responding to finger print
22:15:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Then I checked and no finger prints were enrolled for that particular profile
22:17:03 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, that's really strange!
22:17:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> i did see a similar issue some time ago
22:17:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> let me check the logs
22:17:40 <dazinism> L73689: think i remember someone else reporting this
22:17:52 <dazinism> Maybe worth checking the logs
22:18:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Like on one profile, I managed to enrol 1 finger print , but now it won't let me add any more. How do I check the logs?
22:18:19 <strcat> 18:18:00   libera  -- | ChanServ (ChanServ⊙slc): #grapheneos is already registered to sjs.

22:20:00 <owl> strcat: that's me. I'll PM you on Libera Chat and we can work it out.
22:23:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> @L73689 yes, it was reported before, and it seems like an upstream bug https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os-issue-tracker/issues/435
22:24:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> OK thanks, what's an upstream bug?
22:24:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> thank you for reporting tho, this issue is hard to reproduce so it was only confirmed by folks like you
22:24:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> AOSP bug
22:25:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> that is, it's not a GrapheneOS specific issue, and might be able to reproduce it on Stock (if you could)
22:25:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> * and you might be able
22:26:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Has anyone found a solution ? Or will we need to wait until the aosp is sorted ?
22:29:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you can:1. do nothing and wait until the issue would be fixed2. report the issue to AOSP (commenting under Daniel's report would be better)3. try to fix the problem yourself with some coding knowledge and skills
22:29:50 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> afaik, there is no known solution
22:35:14 <strcat> there's #grapheneos on libera.chat now but I recommend joining the Matrix rooms
22:35:35 <strcat> the IRC to Matrix bridge is too problematic
22:36:30 <strcat[m]> @room please migrate to the new channels #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (the old aliases without -new were also moved to the new channels, but some home servers seem to cache those)
22:37:02 <strcat[m]> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
22:38:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> OK I'll just wait or do the commenting with Daniel if I know how
22:50:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.05.19.06 Just clicked this link, it was posted an hour ago by Daniel, see the bullet points, can anyone explain the point concerning fingerprints
22:51:20 <strcat[m]> you can register fingerprints but then toggle off fingerprint unlock so they aren't used as a secondary unlock mechanism
22:51:44 <strcat[m]> but you can still use them for the other uses of fingerprints (authenticate in apps, protecting hardware keystore keys)
22:51:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Oh OK yeah understood
22:52:01 <strcat[m]> it existed for face unlock and we just copied the face unlock toggle
22:52:08 <strcat[m]> so we know it will work well because it's basically the same code
22:53:31 <louipc> should we just kick everyone
22:53:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Yeah, I don't think my pixel 5 has updated yet, is there a manual update method ?
22:55:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> the update is in beta right now
22:55:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> read this: https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
22:56:15 <Guest66> Is this the right place to ask about errors that occurred during install?
22:56:39 <strcat> louipc: no
22:56:45 <strcat> louipc: we'll just nag them until they move to the new rooms
22:57:00 <strcat> Guest66: you can ask here but you're better off using the new Matrix rooms
22:57:17 <strcat> Guest66: https://grapheneos.org/contact#community
22:57:22 <Guest66> Don't you need a matrix account for that?
22:57:31 <strcat> you can make one without an email
22:57:52 <strcat> just pick a name + password and it works
22:58:01 <Guest66> Thank you
22:58:25 <strcat> we're moving away from these channels
23:00:43 <Guest66> When I try to sign up it gives me a warning saying that an email address is required on this homeserver.
23:03:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> Why are you moving away from telegram
23:03:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> no, not telegram
23:03:15 <strcat> we're moving away from freenode (IRC)
23:03:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> checl the pinned message
23:03:19 <strcat> Telegram is currently bridged to IRC
23:03:44 <strcat> the Telegram bridge is going to be switched to a bridge to the *new* Matrix rooms (the new rooms exist to avoid being bridged to freenode and to upgrade the room version)
23:04:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <L​73689> OK great
23:04:02 <strcat[m]> look at https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
23:04:20 <Guest66> Can anyone explain why "a email is required for this homeserver" when signing up for matrix?
23:04:40 <strcat> Guest66: I guess matrix.org requires that atm, but not all do
23:05:05 <Guest66> Would it be fine to ask my grapheneos install question here then?
23:05:09 <strcat[m]> Guest66 (IRC): try https://element.privacytools.io/ ?
23:05:12 <strcat[m]> Guest66 (IRC): you can ask here
23:05:18 <strcat[m]> just be aware this is going away soon
23:06:57 <Guest66> Okay, my issue is that when using the web-install method I keep on receiving an error when the disk images are being decrypted. The error is saying "Error: The requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired." Does anyone know how to fix this issue, as after this
23:06:58 <Guest66> occurs I cannot finish the installation process.
23:08:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> which OS/device are you using as a host for the installation?
23:09:11 <Guest66> I'm installing using windows
23:09:19 <strcat[m]> that tends to mean you don't have enough disk space
23:09:29 <strcat[m]> the browser only allows the page to use a fraction of disk space
23:09:34 <strcat[m]> make sure you aren't using Incognito mode
23:09:44 <strcat[m]> and try to free up some space, if possible
23:09:58 <Guest66> Would guest mode in chrome do the same thing?
23:10:06 <strcat[m]> it might
23:10:10 <rawtaz> strcat: going over to libre.chat?
23:10:27 <Guest66> Thank you.
23:10:30 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: we're primarily trying to fully migrate to Matrix
23:10:35 <strcat> we made new standalone Matrix rooms
23:10:49 <strcat> #grapheneos:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org now point at the new Matrix rooms
23:11:01 <rawtaz> ok, gotcha. would you mind or consider bridging with corresponding channels on libre.chat?
23:11:10 <strcat> we reserved the channel names on libera.chat but we aren't going to take the same bridge approach
23:11:26 <strcat> rawtaz: the bridge is really problematic, it causes a lot of lag and kicks users from the Matrix room if they don't post a message for 30 days
23:11:44 <rawtaz> hmm i didnt know that. but heck, why not, theyre just idling anyway :-)
23:11:47 <strcat> rawtaz: if we do bridge to libera.chat and/or oftc we need a leaner bot that's not so invasive/problematic
23:12:04 <strcat> rawtaz: well it's bad because lurking for 30 days gets you kicked and people don't really understand
23:12:17 <rawtaz> they might you kicked then :
23:12:17 <strcat> and Matrix is meant to just keep you connected and give you all messages from when you weren't there
23:12:17 <rawtaz> D
23:12:46 <strcat> I want to get as many people as possible into the new Matrix rooms and then we can figure out if we need bridges to IRC
23:12:56 <joepie91[m]> <strcat "#grapheneos:matrix.org and #grap"> it appears my client still believes that the former points at this room
23:13:00 <strcat> but we won't use an approach where the bridge bot needs mod powers
23:13:03 <strcat> it sucks
23:13:13 <rawtaz> just so i dont misunderstand; at this point in time (things might change of course) you're not intending to actively work to connect the libre rooms with matrix (you have other things to do, i know)?
23:13:14 <strcat> joepie91[m]: use #grapheneos-new:matrix.org
23:13:17 <strcat> it's a caching issue, I think
23:13:24 <rawtaz> yeah. so taking it one step at a time, got it
23:13:27 <joepie91[m]> thanks
23:13:28 <strcat> #grapheneos-new:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org
23:13:31 <joepie91[m]> that seems to have worke
23:13:33 <joepie91[m]>  * that seems to have worked
23:13:53 <strcat> rawtaz: well, we definitely aren't doing it via  that irc bridge bot matrix.org provides
23:14:02 <strcat> because it needs admin/mod powers and kicks people who lurk
23:14:19 <strcat> and causes lag
23:14:21 <rawtaz> mm i see
23:14:39 <strcat> rawtaz: we could use a bridge but... it's likely other bridges are badly maintained now
23:14:51 <strcat> and it likely won't work the same way where it makes a connection per user
23:15:01 <strcat> it would be a bad experience
23:15:18 <rawtaz> if i were to make a guess, it would be that you'll still be around in the libre rooms
23:15:20 <strcat> this was a decent experience on irc side, at the expense of kicking tons of people so the community ended up smaller than it should have been
23:15:36 <strcat> rawtaz: they'll be really dead though
23:15:49 <strcat> and they probably won't be linked from our site (unless there is a high quality bridge with no drawbacks)
23:15:56 <rawtaz> we'll just have to put on our udder party suites and start mingling :)
23:16:11 <strcat> atm there isn't a high quality bridge available to use afaik and we don't have it set up
23:16:13 <rawtaz> dont worry about it, one thing at a time. if it comes down to matrix along, it is waht it is
23:16:20 <strcat> so I don't want to send people to a place with 10 people instead of 1000
23:16:38 <strcat> and then if it did grow, it'd be a fragmented community
23:24:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> TG will still be bridged with matrix?
23:24:13 <strcat[m]> @room please migrate to the new channels #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org
23:24:17 <strcat[m]> we plan to make a new Telegram bridge
23:24:23 <strcat[m]> at the moment, Telegram is bridged to IRC, not Matrix
23:24:40 <strcat[m]> the freenode channel was our central room before, that's what makes this a huge hassle
23:25:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Yeah I find it ironic that a lot of communities against decentralization all went for a centralized point lol. I take it will take a while before the bridge gets updated?
23:26:50 <strcat> we were using irc for the project before matrix existed
23:27:01 <strcat> on oftc, originally
23:27:15 <strcat> when the former sponsor stole those channels I made new IRC channels
23:27:46 <strcat> someone had made the Matrix room on our behalf (supposedly) and they sabotaged it rather than let us have it
23:28:34 <strcat> the whole thing gave me a really bad impression of Matrix (the fact that a 4chan troll had made 1000 channels for open source projects an reserved the aliases for them on matrix.org)
23:28:54 <strcat> anyway back then most people were still on irc
23:29:04 <strcat> now nearly everyone is on matrix
23:29:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Moof> Oof that sucks pretty hard. Kind of like how someone bought an expired google domain. People always looking to get a profit no matter thr cost
23:37:56 <rawtaz> 38
