00:57:12 <randomusertester> Shouldn't Grapheneos take advantage of this?? Perfect time to make people aware about privacy
00:57:32 <louipc> randomusertester: get elon to tweet about grapheneos?
00:59:22 <entryware[m]> Lmao.

01:06:11 <strcat[m]> jameshandcockandjoe: just try to avoid causing problems?
01:06:16 <strcat[m]> please
01:09:19 <randomusertester> <louipc "randomusertester: get elon to tw"> Hahaha, not going to haopen. But just make people aware about online privacy
01:10:29 <thematrix5000[m]> Edward snowden tweeted about graphene
01:12:14 <jazzee[m]> <louipc "randomusertester: get elon to tw"> Elon is too dumb to use Graphene or even android.
01:12:42 <louipc> jazzee[m]: errkay
01:13:36 <LinusSexTips[m]> ah yes the low-iq iphone using billionaire could not figure out how to copy paste a couple commands into powershell
01:13:52 <thematrix5000[m]> snowden knows people that want to know about the NSA will go look at him and watch his interviews. musk will just talk about the future with his technology to be used as a means to control everyone
01:15:29 <thematrix5000[m]> your average person will never be aware of prism and NSA surveillance or care because they're manipulated slaves to begin with. they need google play to live and the appple store
01:15:53 <jameshandcockand> Elon is pretty low IQ + he has all those African slaves mining cobalt
01:16:12 <Thatcher[m]> Alright, this shit should be taken to off topic
01:16:14 <jameshandcockand> + Union busting and making his workers work during a pandemic among other stuff
01:16:22 <thematrix5000[m]> how many people even use something as simple as keepass? under 1% of people on computers and phones for sure.
01:17:30 <louipc> thematrix5000[m]: eh they don't -really- need it, but those are the most functional ecosystems
01:17:40 <louipc> and accessible
01:20:51 <jk4356> Hello
01:22:30 <Thatcher[m]> <jk4356 "Hello"> Hi
01:23:52 <jk4356> I posted a question on Reddit and I was directed here...
01:26:43 <jazzee[m]> What was the question ?
01:27:19 <jk4356> I'm trying to istall Graphene OS on my Pixel 4a from Debian Buster...When I run ./flash-all.sh it stop at < waiting for any device >On the fastbootd screen I have four options:1. Reboot system now2. Enter recovery 3. Reboot the bootloader 4. Power off.When I try to run sudo ./flash-all.sh it says the following:fastboot not found; please download
01:27:19 <jk4356> the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and add it to the shell PATHI have no idea how to fix this so any help would be greatly appreciated.
01:28:36 <Thatcher[m]> jk4356 are you following the official install guide https://grapheneos.org/install
01:28:47 <jk4356> Yes
01:30:47 <Thatcher[m]> When you type 'fastboot --version' into terminal, what version does it say?
01:34:12 <jk4356> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
01:34:51 <jk4356> After I run this export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
01:35:30 <Ramp23> What's the problem ?
01:35:43 <noman000[m]> jk4356 You may try installing fastboot from the repository
01:35:43 <noman000[m]> sudo apt install fastboot
01:43:11 <Ramp23> Any one know what the expected end support date for pixel 3a is ?
02:19:23 <louipc> Ramp23: same as google
02:22:07 <Ramp23> Ahh great thanks !
02:35:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> <entryware[m] "hypokeimenonüñ§‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà ^"> lol
03:11:26 <take_a_deep_brea> <thematrix5000[m] "your average person will never b"> we all at some point have used google play and apple store  no need to come down so hard on "slaves" just because you use grapheneOS .if you can please spread the word about graphene , privacy and security otherwise this is not the place to express such disdain against regular people.
03:12:36 <take_a_deep_brea> and what do you think you can do now that ypu are "aware " of NSA and Prism , huh ethan hunt ?
03:21:19 <take_a_deep_brea> strcat and other devs here take their time out here to answer questions even though they are covered in the official website.what does that tell you about our policy here with regular people?
03:21:19 <take_a_deep_brea> we dont judge them.
03:21:19 <take_a_deep_brea> if theyve come here we help them along.
03:24:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> Attitude towards regular people is one of the worst things about these privacy/technically inclined communities
03:24:33 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS is meant to be user-friendly
03:24:53 <somenerd[m]> which is probably why it's quite nice to new people imo
03:25:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> Security should be easy/default otherwise you hurt the chances of it being adopted
03:26:08 <somenerd[m]> or the chances of users messing up
03:26:33 <rny> if security features are hard to use, people just wont use them lol
03:26:42 <rny> sad, but true!@
03:26:52 <rny> see selinux
03:27:03 <somenerd[m]> see all of linux
03:40:47 <somenerd[m]> actually hardening them takes forever
03:41:07 <somenerd[m]>  * actually hardening it takes forever
03:41:25 <somenerd[m]> and almost no one wants to do it (or doesn't have the time)
03:42:31 <waistbin[m]> what is the default keyboard in GrapheneOS? the AOSP one?
03:43:26 <rny> waistbin[m]: ye, the aosp one
03:43:54 <rny> somenerd[m]: hardening takes time and effort, the payoff might not necessarily be realisable either
03:44:59 <somenerd[m]> yeah, even then it might not be as good as something like AOSP or GrapheneOS
03:45:30 <waistbin[m]> @rny do people usually switch to a different keyboard?
03:45:43 <waistbin[m]> as in, does the AOSP one rely on Google in any way
03:45:49 <rny> waistbin[m]: i installed teh google keyboard and tripped network permissions
03:45:53 <rny> stripped
03:46:08 <waistbin[m]> ah
03:46:16 <rny> its left to user discretion what they want to do
03:47:05 <somenerd[m]> I think it's preferred to do that only if you don't have other google apps with the network perm installed
03:48:42 <somenerd[m]> (since through IPC, gboard could ask the other google app to exfiltrate data for it)
03:49:49 <louipc> throw it in a fire
03:52:26 <JK4356> I think I may have destroyed my new pixel 4a
03:53:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> JK4356: need help?
03:54:02 <JK4356> I'm trying to istall Graphene OS on my Pixel 4a from Debian Buster...When I run ./flash-all.sh it stop at < waiting for any device >On the fastbootd screen I have four options:1.

03:54:03 <JK4356> the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and add it to the shell PATH
03:55:13 <JK4356> I followed the instructions from here: https://grapheneos.org/install
03:55:22 <FuchsiaOS_when> Not really
03:55:38 <FuchsiaOS_when> Not supposed to use sudo, not supposed to download the platform tools at browser
03:56:19 <Knull[m]> <rny "waistbin: i installed teh google"> yeah i was shocked when i first heard that. But i've heard it so many times and done it myself now too.
03:56:20 <FuchsiaOS_when> Suggesting to start over and copy paste the commands as is
03:56:53 <JK4356> I did copy and paste the commands. I have no idea what happened
03:56:58 <makingaliasesisa> Use this command from graphene site? export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH
03:57:12 <makingaliasesisa> * Did you use this command from graphene site? export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH
03:57:17 <JK4356> How yes
03:57:22 <JK4356> yes
04:00:28 <JK4356> and fastboot --version shows the following: fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
04:01:28 <makingaliasesisa> Does it have aanything like Installed as /home/username/platform-tools/
04:01:59 <JK4356> yes
04:03:09 <JK4356> After I run ./flash-all.sh
04:03:35 <JK4356> It gets stuck on < waiting for any device >
04:03:45 <JK4356> Should I run it as root?
04:04:45 <makingaliasesisa> I think it needs to run as root as it does have this link on the page
04:04:50 <makingaliasesisa> https://grapheneos.org/install#fastboot-as-non-root
04:05:18 <makingaliasesisa> Actually this should make it so you dont
04:05:24 <makingaliasesisa> sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common
04:05:33 <makingaliasesisa> * Actually this should make it so you dont need to
04:07:02 <JK4356> I ran sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools-common
04:07:30 <JK4356> and it still gets stuck on < waiting for any device >
04:09:33 <makingaliasesisa> I had the same problem at one point and just cant remember if I got it work after that. I think I just restarted the instructions a few times and got it to work. üòõ
04:09:53 <makingaliasesisa> I am running arch though
04:10:54 <JK4356> I went through the instructions at least six times now. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.
04:10:54 <makingaliasesisa> You should be able to recover from this point as I had a message saying I had no OS on the device at one point
04:12:26 <JK4356> I didn't install all the security updates before installing. Could that be the problem?
04:12:59 <makingaliasesisa> I did it about as many times and I had installed the updates before
04:15:48 <JK4356> Maybe it has something to do with the cable. I'm using one from a different phone.
04:16:48 <makingaliasesisa> I heard it could mess it up
04:17:21 <FuchsiaOS_when> <makingaliasesisa "I think it needs to run as root "> Not really.
04:17:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> JK4356: sudo fastboot devices
04:18:06 <FuchsiaOS_when> welp, that's on you now
04:18:06 <FuchsiaOS_when> Was about to suggest trying to plug it to other ports, or use other cables
04:18:17 <makingaliasesisa> Yeah I found out that the udev package existed on the Debian repos Degoogled FuchsiaOS when?
04:18:21 <take_a_deep_brea> <anupritaisno1[m] "JK4356: sudo fastboot devices"> the udev rules no help in debian?
04:18:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> take_a_deep_breath: who knows how outdated those are
04:19:06 <makingaliasesisa> You can the most up to date from here https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules
04:19:08 <take_a_deep_brea> hmmm, yesh
04:19:32 <makingaliasesisa> That is the one arch uses
04:20:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just want to know the output of fastboot devices when running as root
04:21:36 <FuchsiaOS_when> Cool, haven't tried that yet myself, that's why levaing that to you
04:23:34 <makingaliasesisa> JK4356: try what anupritaisno1 is saying
04:28:23 <JK4356> sudo: fastboot: command not found
04:29:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> facepalm time
04:29:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> sudo su
04:29:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Run that export PATH command again
04:32:23 <JK4356> Sorry I'm new to Linux
04:35:30 <JK4356> It still says sudo: fastboot: command not found
04:35:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't prefix sudo
04:35:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should be root already
04:38:45 <JK4356> bash: fastboot: command not found
04:39:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> JK4356: you have windows?
04:55:25 <JK4356> Yes
05:15:36 <noman000[m]> JK4356: did you reboot the phone to the bootloader?  Seems like I had an issue with that.
05:25:44 <noman000[m]> JK4356 if it is showing that fastboot is not found then it is not installed in linux.   Maybe try
05:25:45 <noman000[m]> sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
05:25:45 <noman000[m]> The export command let's you use the packaged binary that is in the GOS folder.  So you can either install fastboot using apt or use the export command.
05:26:39 <noman000[m]> * JK4356 if it is showing that fastboot is not found then it is not installed in linux.   Maybe try
05:26:40 <noman000[m]> sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot

05:55:01 <TheJollyRoger> noman000[m]: I'm going to stop you right there before you brick his phone.
05:55:47 <rny> the webusb thing really gotta happen lol
05:56:21 <TheJollyRoger> noman000[m]: The version of fastboot in Debian and Ubuntu is many years out of date and doesn't support autodetection properly. If you install those, and use the wrong pathing, AND your device is on the wrong slot, you're going to find out what the "no valid operating system" error screen looks like in a hurry.
05:56:44 <rny> but webadb cant help if udev rules arent setup properly
05:56:45 <rny> :(
05:57:09 <TheJollyRoger> Argh.
06:25:47 <lasseter[m]> Uhg, I have to use Slack for work.  It works fine on GOS for me with the exception of notifications.  I get none and have to manually enter the app and refresh.  Is this something that microg (I keep seeing mentions of it, but don't really get what is provides) would fix?
06:27:29 <somenerd[m]> not sure if it would, but microg isn't supported by GrapheneOS atm
06:56:11 <lasseter[m]> I wonder if maybe I should just set up a matrix server and slack bridge to get around it.  Then I would not need the slack app at all.  Hmmmmm
07:41:19 <anonhat[m]> We really need an easier installer. WebUSB sounds really sketchy, but I think it's the best thing we have.
07:44:49 <anonhat[m]> > Yes
07:44:49 <anonhat[m]> Try re-downloading the Android tools. It's possible that it's corrupted due to a network error. It could also be your USB cable or ports. Or it could be a Debian bug. For a while, it seemed that every time I installed Debian on my computers, no matter what, something was wrong with the install. And it was a different thing every time, usually due to corruption from my poor internet connection. Not verifying
07:44:49 <anonhat[m]> hashes/signatures upon download will cause that to happen some times since you may have downloaded a corrupt file and didn't check it.

09:32:03 <Dubbleyu[m]> Hi all, very new to GrapheneOS. I seem to be having an issue with charging my device today (4a). The device shows it's plugged in but it doesn't visually show an increase in charge. I was stuck on 28% then rebooted and it's showing 78% now but not increasing.
09:37:53 <FuchsiaOS_when> Sounds like more of battery problem
09:38:38 <Dubbleyu[m]> Its brand new
09:43:49 <Dubbleyu[m]> It does seem to be increasing now after multiple restarts
09:45:59 <theOne[m]> Does the new update break Aurora store?
09:46:37 <Dubbleyu[m]> <theOne[m] "Does the new update break Aurora"> Its working for me. It wasn't for the last 2 days though
09:47:51 <theOne[m]> Ok
10:02:27 <Golli[m]1> <theOne[m] "Does the new update break Aurora"> Funny you say that, I haven't been able to open it this update so far, but I'm giving it a couple days before I call it a problem since it's the Aurora store..
10:05:15 <FuchsiaOS_when> Try toggling on-off the custom tokenizer
10:13:12 <gross_papaya[m]> <FuchsiaOS_when "Try toggling on-off the custom t"> Yeah worked for me too
11:48:01 <rheaalleen[m]> if I open the settings in Gallery nothing is displayed
11:57:33 <nscnt> rheaalleen[m]: The Gallery app is bundled with AOSP and is unmaintained. If you want a gallery app with more functionalities, you'll need to install another gallery app
12:03:31 <take_a_deep_brea> rheaalleen: its an open issue.you can help by hunting for a good app that fits our special needs or indeed build one yourself !(no sarcasm)
12:03:31 <take_a_deep_brea> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/48
12:05:12 <rheaalleen[m]> All good, just wanted to ask if its a known problem
12:40:23 <blacklight447[m]> Btw, i wonder, is it possible to configure vanadium to only use https?
12:40:24 <blacklight447[m]> Basically just block accessing http websites
12:40:25 <blacklight447[m]> (Or give a warning of some sort)
12:42:06 <take_a_deep_brea> blacklight447:  i think it is possible , just wait a sec ...
12:49:01 <take_a_deep_brea> blacklight447: there are no toggles in settings or chrome://flags flag that do exactly that
12:50:42 <take_a_deep_brea> but there is one chrome flag chrome://flags/#dns-httpssvc which does upgrade connections to https on a best effort basis i am not very familiar but here is the relevant doc if you are interested https://docs.google.com/document/d/14eCqVyT_3MSj7ydqNFl1Yl0yg1fs6g24qmYUUdi5V-k/edit#!

13:14:59 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe . but chrom{e,ium} has Safe Browsing which can also be used either in tandem with remote servers in case of chrome or have a local imiplementation which does not communicate with a server al the time .
13:15:22 <somenerd[m]> I think that that's not equilavent
13:15:33 <somenerd[m]>  * I think that that's not equivalent
13:16:03 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
13:16:36 <take_a_deep_brea> i was one-upping justanotherlurker:  on security features , lol
13:16:47 <somenerd[m]> I think FF has that too
13:16:57 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry not a very constructive answer
13:17:25 <somenerd[m]> > So that's finally one security thing that Firefox does better?
13:17:25 <somenerd[m]> the phrasing made it seem like FF was worse
13:17:37 <somenerd[m]> anyway, kinda drifting off topic
13:18:29 <take_a_deep_brea> not as long as we talk of vanadium/chromium features .but yeah we sure will , from past experience ...
13:20:43 <take_a_deep_brea> <justanotherlurke "So that's finally one security t"> mostly , but im sure chromium/chrome have some equivalent let me search .atleast a reason why they didnt bother to add such a feature  ...
13:41:02 <somenerd[m]> maybe in the future
13:41:54 <take_a_deep_brea> please take a look at chrome://net-internals/#hsts but also read some documentation before tweaking

15:17:42 <strcat[m]> jos: no
15:17:54 <strcat[m]> if you want it to be supported you'll need to contribute to the project
15:20:41 <strcat[m]> blacklight447: it already does block mixed content and gives a warning on insecure (HTTP) origins

15:23:33 <strcat[m]>  * and Vanadium enables the final state of marking insecure content as dangerous even though it's not shipped yet
15:24:46 <strcat[m]> it's not like you don't know if you're on an insecure origin
15:24:54 <strcat[m]> so sure it could support a toggle where you can forbid yourself from choosing to use those
15:27:57 <strcat[m]> dunno what you really gain from that
15:28:11 <strcat[m]> you'll just end up turning it off

17:59:30 <strcat[m]> you have 3 choices: install it via Aurora Store, install it via their website apk releases (self-updating) or use the Molly fork via F-Droid
17:59:30 <jazzee[m]> <SAM53 "when i go yo websie i haev to lo"> To download signal ? Nope
17:59:32 <strcat[m]> don't need a Google account for any of those

18:06:46 <malicoye[m]> * Installing apk from a website won't auto update APKs
18:07:02 <jazzee[m]> Yeah, exactly...Just use Aurora store with anonymous login mate
18:07:26 <SAM53> i don;t wanna any login
18:07:30 <malicoye[m]> Unless it's signal or telegram or few others that self update
18:07:37 <jazzee[m]> Too bad signal doesn't have an official fdroid repo

18:08:30 <gross_papaya[m]> Is Aurora Store any better than fdroid?
18:08:36 <strcat[m]> malicoye: the official F-Droid repository has a lot of issues but those serious problems largely don't apply to using other repos
18:08:49 <strcat[m]> the app itself has some issues
18:08:50 <cyberparty> <gross_papaya[m] "Is Aurora Store any better than "> Different use cases.

18:12:30 <strcat[m]> you can install it without adb
18:12:36 <strcat[m]> you don't need adb to install an apk
18:13:10 <SAM53> yes i can also use adb sideload

18:20:04 <cyberparty> "OpenVPN for Android" works well.
18:21:36 <BoomOperator[m]> There is even wireguard available!
18:22:25 <BoomOperator[m]> But hes looking for smth different i guess.
18:22:29 <SAM53> i want a vpn when i am on internet i don't wanna show my ip
18:22:43 <SAM53> i want to go internet by a tunnel
18:23:22 <BoomOperator[m]> tried orbot yet?
18:23:24 <take_a_deep_brea> SAM53: i have not used one , but i think you should take a look at mullvad as it uses wireguard by default .
18:23:24 <take_a_deep_brea> you can learn more aboit wireguard here
18:23:24 <take_a_deep_brea> https://www.wireguard.com/
18:26:44 <cheeriope[m]> SAM53: Orbot for Tor, ProtonVPN or Mullvad for VPN
18:26:54 <cheeriope[m]> (those are my personal recommendations as of today)
18:26:59 <cheeriope[m]> (things change)
18:27:27 <SAM53> i read on Mullvad for VPN it looks oke
18:27:37 <cheeriope[m]> but also this is better suited for #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
18:29:44 <take_a_deep_brea> cheeriope: ok
18:30:22 <BoomOperator[m]> Am i the only 1 missing a decent netfilter frontend bundled with gos? Rooting for installing afwall+ couldnt be the golden path at all?
18:31:22 <strcat> what do you intend to do with that which would actually be useful?
18:31:44 <strcat> and how do you think destroying the security model and trusting the whole high level OS / application layer and an app with root access would make any sense?
18:31:56 <strcat> if you'd even consider that I don't think GrapheneOS is the right fit for you
18:32:24 <strcat> you have the Network toggle which doesn't just disable direct network access but also indirect via APIs requiring the INTERNET permission
18:32:42 <strcat> per-app firewall rules won't restrict indirect access so they can't really work
18:33:04 <strcat> the Network toggle depends on code properly enforcing it but it *can* work
18:33:49 <strcat> strongly suggest reading our documentation
18:36:21 <take_a_deep_brea> Boom Operator: its not a good idea to give root access to an app that uses android vpn feature . its not efficient too.its a SPOF
18:36:38 <strcat> it's not an option anyway
18:36:44 <nscnt[m]> rafff: I'm not talking about the Device Manager. You wouldn't even see the Pixel in the Device Manager as a Pixel device if you're in the bootloader interface. Boot into the bootloader interface and connect it to the pc. In the regular Windows Updates window (or "Check for updates"; not Device Manager!) there might be a "View optional updates" now.
18:36:44 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
18:37:05 <cheeriope[m]> hmm, installing GOS on a new phone and getting the "no valid slot to boot" message
18:37:09 <cheeriope[m]> any ideas?
18:38:05 <strcat> cheeriope[m]: follow https://grapheneos.org/install and don't follow an unofficial guide
18:38:09 <strcat> cheeriope[m]: are you following that?
18:38:17 <strcat> if you are, make sure to read the information on USB cables
18:38:23 <strcat> most USB-C cables are broken
18:38:34 <strcat> use the one that comes with the phone or a *high quality* one
18:38:35 <cheeriope[m]> strcat: following the official guide step by step, and ive done this before
18:38:45 <strcat> has other advice about USB
18:39:08 <cheeriope[m]> plugged into a non-hub port on a macbook pro
18:39:16 <cheeriope[m]> and its the cable that came with it
18:39:29 <cheeriope[m]> (4a)
18:39:53 <strcat> try flashing again
18:41:31 <Adamas[m]> tfw newest update removed the wallpaper
18:42:58 <strcat> just made the default a black one
18:43:01 <strcat> there's still a default
18:43:15 <strcat> just not that low res upscaled purple AOSP Nougat wallpaper
18:43:40 <strcat> if we decide to stick a GrapheneOS logo on it or something, it's still going to be a black wallpaper
18:44:19 <cyberparty> The AOSP wallpaper I felt was actually painful for me to look at
18:44:37 <strcat> agree, just not a priority for us to bikeshed theme, etc.
18:44:46 <strcat> made a few simple changes
18:47:32 <Adamas[m]> ah, anyone have a copy of the previous wallpaper?
18:47:50 <Adamas[m]> I actually liked it a lot.
18:49:15 <cheeriope[m]> alright well a spare USB C cable and two flash attempts later
18:49:23 <cheeriope[m]> new phone is flashed fellas
18:51:26 <take_a_deep_brea> great!
18:52:32 <take_a_deep_brea> Adamas: just search on web you should get it
18:54:11 <Adamas[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "Adamas: just search on web you s"> im an idiot i guess. having trouble finding it. will continue looking tho.
18:54:38 <cyberparty> Adamas: https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2499673.png
18:56:15 <strcat[m]> it's in the AOSP sources
18:56:22 <strcat[m]> you can see the commit where we removed it
18:56:24 <strcat[m]> and get it from there too
19:00:19 <Adamas[m]> appreciate it guys.
19:05:45 <cheeriope[m]> how concerned should i be that the person who sold me this phone left their SIM card in it
19:05:53 <cheeriope[m]> just discovered this now
19:06:32 <strcat> cheeriope[m]: doesn't matter much
19:07:14 <strcat> the most privileged thing the SIM card can do is open a URL

19:10:29 <Dar1n> anyone know why my data is roaming after I installed graphene?
19:10:50 <strcat[m]> your carrier says it is
19:11:28 <Dar1n> How would I fix this just dialing my carrier
19:20:23 <take_a_deep_brea> is there any documentation for what all sensors come under the sensors permssion for apps ?
19:20:48 <BoomOperator[m]> strcat: after reading a lengthy thread on rd.it from daniel all became a lot more clear. Thx!
19:21:04 <take_a_deep_brea> or should i refer to https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview
19:21:09 <strcat> take_a_deep_brea: every sensor not covered by an existing permission (camera, microphone, body sensors, activity recognition)
19:21:35 <strcat> take_a_deep_brea: we set this as the *default* permission for *all* sensors
19:21:46 <strcat> anything with a specific permission overrides it
19:22:22 <take_a_deep_brea> okay.
19:26:32 <Dar1n> would it be possible for someone to audit me on this chat or would that be weird
19:27:06 <bentley> what do you mean by audit?
19:27:34 <Dar1n> audit my install with the auditor app
19:28:18 <strcat> Dar1n: just use https://attestation.app/
19:28:21 <radf> Anyone having issues with the newest version on Pixel 4. My screen keeps going black even though the phone is on and I have to restart multiple times to fix it
19:29:01 <strcat> Dar1n: the 1st verification is not strong - it's primarily meant to do strong verification from that point onwards

20:43:49 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys, does anyone know offhand which SKU numbers for the 4a denote Verizon/Google devices? I'm thinking I should do some more writing on this.
21:20:58 <entry1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hey guys, does anyone know offha"> Would this help instead? People can check their IMEI number in this link to see if the phone is compatible with GrapheneOS
21:22:04 <entry1[m]> https://store.google.com/us/repair
21:22:05 <entry1[m]> Have to log in with any Google Account to run an IMEI check as it denotes the original carrier/unlock variant of the phone
21:33:01 <squarmkt[m]> There was something about the imei starting with 35 vs 99 but its not always the case I think
21:50:45 <joltman[m]> I found that all the Pixel 3XL phones I've encountered that begin with 35 are Verizon and all the ones beginning with 99 are the Google ones, but not sure about other models and other countries. Keep in mind that my experience is anecdotal, but matches what I've read other places.
21:51:40 <joltman[m]> The repair site at Google is much more reliable. That's probably the best resource you can rely on in terms of internet web sites.
21:52:40 <grapheneuser1732> Hi, I'm using the recent version of graphene os on a pixel 3a. The faq entry about disk encryption suggests that there should be a delay after entering the wrong passphrase multiple times. I just tried this out, I can enter the wrong passphrase >30 times without any delay. Have I missundestood something?
22:07:26 <grapheneuser1732> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
22:27:40 <Birdie[m]> <grapheneuser1732 "Hi, I'm using the recent version"> Are you doing that when booting up? Or from when you are logged in as a secondary user profile, attempting to log back into main user profile?
22:30:19 <grapheneuser1732> I tested this for booting up and for the normal screen lock when using the "main" profile. Both no delays.
22:36:57 <Birdie[m]> <grapheneuser1732 "I tested this for booting up and"> I just tested it, got 30 second delay after 5 failed attempts when I switched to secondary profile.
22:39:14 <Birdie[m]> I think it's when you have multiple user profiles and switching between them.
22:39:14 <Birdie[m]> I'll try a rebooting now and test it with the boot encryption passphrase for main user profile login and system.
22:45:24 <grapheneuser1732> I tested creating a secondary user, setting password for it, exit session. Then enter password for "owner" profile wrong 30 times. No delay. Switch user to tge newly created secondary user. Enter wrong password 30 times. No delay.

22:49:40 <Birdie[m]> Hmmm
22:49:54 <grapheneuser1732> Strange... Somehow worrying...
22:49:54 <grapheneuser1732> Since this delay should be hardware-enforced this indicates that there is something fundamentally wrong. Or what do you think? Any idea how to further debug this? Any further infirmation that could be helpful?
