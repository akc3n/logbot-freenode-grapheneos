08:19:38 <Floria[m]> hi
08:19:52 <Netestertes> hi floria
08:20:30 <Netestertes> i dont have experience with google phone and looking one phone for start
08:21:05 <Netestertes> Can i instal this os on that phone GOOGLE Pixel - 5.0"?
08:21:14 <nscnt[m]> Netestertes: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
08:21:32 <Netestertes> i didnt see it there i look the link before
08:21:46 <Floria[m]> <Netestertes "Can i instal this os on that pho"> I doubt it's possible with original Pixel, but Pixel 5 is supported
08:22:16 <Netestertes> how to find difference
08:22:28 <Netestertes> this is 2 diff phones right

08:23:50 <Floria[m]> <Netestertes "https://www.ebay.ca/itm/22399442"> Oh, that's the original Pixel.
08:24:04 <Floria[m]> Not supported. Pixel 5 has a punchole front camera
08:24:26 <Netestertes> Thank you
08:24:44 <Netestertes> what model you recommend for start
08:25:50 <Floria[m]> My recommendation is similar to website, if there's not a tight budget constraint (4a (5G) is the latest one released if I got that right)
08:26:20 <Floria[m]> Pixel 4a (5G) or Pixel 5
08:26:20 <Floria[m]> Otherwise, Pixel 4a
08:27:49 <Netestertes> you help me a lot thanks

09:56:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <S​hanePedler> A question: I've been using GrapheneOS as my daily driver for a few months. During the day, I play videos in the background on Kiwi Browser while I work. If I pause a video for longer than 10 minutes, the lock screen controls disappear. This didn't happen on my previous phone (Xperia XZ2 Compact). I have battery optimization disabled, but no difference. I guess this is part of the higher security aspect of GrapheneOS.
10:15:50 <helloworldkk87[m> Sound like AOSP thing
11:39:19 <GhostSplinterSix> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<ShanePedler> A question: I've b"> What's your question?
12:06:22 <Thatcher[m]> He's asking if disappearance of Kiwi's lock screen audio controls are associated with the enhanced security of Graphene, and if we have a solution
12:09:42 <Thatcher[m]> Seems to me like it is some sort of security thing. But who knows? Maybe someone can chime in
12:14:35 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Was the app still running when unlocked?
12:15:12 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Or is the website not refreshed when unlocked?
12:15:34 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> (Not sure what happened, but it'll be nice to have more info and narrow it down)
12:20:50 <nscnt[m]> Every service consumes valuable system resources. If it's not being used anyway, the app should free up those resources. Sounds like it just follows "good" practice

12:26:29 <eleberum[m]> Does the shelter app on f droid work on graphene? It says in the description that it can possibly brick some ROMs like MIUI so I was curious.

15:25:30 <EV-9600[m]> Hi, I'm trying to build GrapheneOS on my own, and I'm at the part where it says "Extracting vendor files for Pixel devices"
15:25:30 <EV-9600[m]> It says something about DEVICE and BUILD_ID, but I'm not sure what are those
15:28:19 <m2tu[m]> @EV-9600:matrix.org: hi
15:28:27 <m2tu[m]> did u managed to do it ?
15:28:37 <EV-9600[m]> No

15:29:46 <m2tu[m]> build_id is the nbumbr u got when u did choosecombo

15:31:34 <m2tu[m]> yes . the device part ofthe source is dffrence
15:31:55 <m2tu[m]> but all other are same source

15:35:27 <EV-9600[m]> So is the name just "sunfish"? Or is it " Sunfish-factory"?

16:26:28 <m2tu[m]> when u get it
16:26:39 <m2tu[m]> in which step
16:29:25 <sklv1> Essjay[m]: You would, but they don't have to go in the same phone - you'd just have to receive the confirmation code on a 2nd phone and enter it.
16:30:39 <sklv1> If app data is completely segmented by profile, i imagine it could work.
16:32:16 <sklv1> but if "Profiles are not a way to sandbox apps" then probably not
16:58:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> wenden (@w​enden_harvet) has joined the Telegram Group!
17:03:55 <helloworldkk87[m> Profiles are not going to offer "stronger" sandbox but they can be good for apps refusing to run without a data access permission being granted
17:04:34 <helloworldkk87[m> But if the app doesnt need much permissions anyways there really is no point imo
17:05:39 <deadlydata[m]> hey if i was to put f droid privileged extension within sys apps when building the rom
17:05:44 <deadlydata[m]> would it work or would i still need root permissions?
17:10:48 <flawedworld[m]> <deadlydata[m] "hey if i was to put f droid priv"> off topic please
17:13:27 <strcat[m]> deadlydata: nothing about that requires 'root permissions'
17:13:34 <strcat[m]> don't know where you get that idea from
17:16:25 <EV-9600[m]> <m2tu[m] "in which step"> It was in the same step, I fixed it by installing google-api-python-client with pip
18:25:50 <jalb> Hello, a question about profiles: if for example I use 3 profiles in some moment and I close session in 1 of them, is this profile connecting in the background yet while I' m connected to another profile?
18:26:36 <TheJollyRoger> If you close a profile, the apps that it was running are halted.
18:26:41 <jalb> I dont understand very well being "at rest"
18:26:53 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, let me explain a bit:
18:27:02 <jalb> Oh thanks, like stopped?
18:27:12 <TheJollyRoger> Let's take the analogy of a house.
18:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> You have a bedroom, a storage room, and a kitchen.
18:27:45 <TheJollyRoger> Each room has one door with a lock on it.
18:28:03 <TheJollyRoger> As you walk around the house, let's say you're going to enter the bedroom. So you unlock your bedroom door and go inside.
18:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> But let's say you forgot you needed something in the storage room, so you go ahead and unlock the storage room.
18:29:17 <TheJollyRoger> But then after you're finished cleaning up the bedroom, you shut the door and lock it. You can't get back inside it without unlocking the door. That room is the equivalent now of being "at rest." It's no longer in use. You can't get back in without putting the key in the lock and turning it.
18:29:29 <TheJollyRoger> Similarly, let's say you have profiles "Alice, Bob, Charlie."
18:29:42 <TheJollyRoger> Alice is the Owner, so her keys must always be in memory.
18:30:03 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say you unlock Bob and Charlie, but then you're finished doing what you're doing in profile Charlie, so you hit End Session.
18:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> That's the equivalent of locking the door on your bedroom. The keys no longer exist in memory once you hit that "End Session" button.
18:30:49 <TheJollyRoger> The keys for all the data in Charlie are no longer in memory. The phone's operating system cannot read, modify, or enumerate the files once they're at rest.
18:30:51 <jalb> Even when internet is shared between profiles!
18:30:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
18:30:56 <jalb> ?
18:31:12 <jalb> Great analogy, thanks!
18:31:13 <TheJollyRoger> The operating system itself is essentially saying "I'm finished with these files. Charlie is done his day."
18:31:43 <jalb> :)
18:31:50 <jalb> Thank you!
18:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> That's what "At Rest" means. It'd be like if you took the bedroom key off your keychain and put it safely away. You need to get those keys, before you can open the bedroom door again.
18:32:06 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
18:32:14 <jalb> Great
18:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> To further analogize:
18:32:50 <TheJollyRoger> Full Disk Encryption would be like putting one key to your whole house, with only one lock, on the front gate.
18:33:19 <jalb> Ok
18:33:20 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, when someone wants in, they can't even access the grounds, without the key.
18:33:33 <TheJollyRoger> But File Based Encryption, the way GrapheneOS does it, is like putting one lock on every door to the house.
18:33:41 <TheJollyRoger> This way, you can keep some doors locked, when they aren't in use.
18:34:21 <jalb> Is it the same in normal android (except the end session feature)?
18:34:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, but only 7 or later.
18:34:45 <jalb> Oh ok
18:34:50 <jalb> Thx
18:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
18:35:04 <TheJollyRoger> Google Pixels also go the extra mile:
18:35:25 <TheJollyRoger> Because of the security chip, the keys for the phone can only be derived on *that particular handset*, with *that particular security chip.*
18:35:56 <jalb> Yes, I know
18:36:00 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
18:36:23 <jalb> Yes, great :)
18:36:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hope this helps!
18:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> **door in the house
18:39:22 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops.
18:39:43 <jalb> Yes

21:22:57 <mimimi> Hi peeps, hope everyone's well! I need a confirmation before going the CLI route ; I'm trying the WebUSB installer but neither Edge or Chromium detects the phone. Checked winupdate but nothing's showing as far as extra driver installs. USB C cable is brand new. Device manager shows the Pixel with an exclamation mark but cannot find drivers on
21:22:57 <mimimi> winupdate. Phone had USB debug & OEM unlock activated and displays the fastboot mode screen, device state locked. Is there additional  ADB/WebUSB software/driver I need to download for browsers to pick up the device?
21:22:58 <mimimi> Thanks a bunch! :)
21:31:25 <Pratyush[m]> i think you should try rebooting in fastboot mode -> connect to pc -> check for win update
21:31:25 <Pratyush[m]> Do not use Incognito mode.
21:40:43 <mimimi> OK thanks trying
21:46:24 <mimimi> didn't work, might be due to some debloat settings I use though... However I went ahead & downloaded Google USB Fastboot drivers, installed manually via device manager and now Edge sees the Pixel. Thanks for your reply nonetheless! :)
21:51:09 <mimimi> I have to say it is a very classy flashing method, never seen it before, never used WebUSB neither, congrats to whoever came up with it!
