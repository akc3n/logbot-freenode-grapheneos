00:56:22 <ash[m]1> is it possible to allow apps to run in the background unrestricted? I'd like to be able to get consistent matrix notification with element however the system seems to disable it
01:42:26 <vpsvrm[m]1> Do you know what is CarrierHub app by T-Mobile for auth? How is dangerous about tracking or localization?
01:55:07 <johnbillians[m]> The section at https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices is a little vague. Can I use the fingerprint sensor on the Pixel 4a with GrapheneOS?
01:59:20 <User78> I haven't tried it but there is an option in the settings for fingerprint
02:05:33 <ash[m]1> also another question, anyone have experience with MicroG?
02:06:38 <TheJollyRoger> johnbillians[m]: Fingerprint sensor on 4a with GrapheneOS is tested and working.
02:08:39 <johnbillians[m]> TheJollyRoger:
02:08:39 <ash[m]1> <johnbillians[m] "The section at https://grapheneo"> on my 4a rn and it works perfectly
02:09:00 <johnbillians[m]> do we know if the face unlock is working in the 4?
02:09:15 <johnbillians[m]> (sorry lol that paragraph really threw me for a loop)
02:09:26 <johnbillians[m]>  * do we know if the face unlock is working with the 4?
02:10:00 <johnbillians[m]>  * do we know if face unlock is working with the 4?
02:12:09 <TheJollyRoger> Tested and working.
02:13:15 <johnbillians[m]> Thanks for your help (you too ash)!
02:13:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. GrapheneOS releases full, production-quality releases.
02:14:11 <TheJollyRoger> The Face Unlock with 4 even works in the dark if you hold the phone up to your face at the right distance.
02:14:18 <johnbillians[m]> yeah I just couldn't tell by that paragraph on the site if it was saying it has those features or doesn't
02:14:32 <johnbillians[m]> cant decide between buying a secondhand 4 or 4a
02:14:37 * TheJollyRoger thinks.
02:14:40 <johnbillians[m]> i'd like to contribute to the project
02:14:45 <TheJollyRoger> That'd be awesome!
02:14:51 <AndrsBS[m]> easy one, the 4a
02:14:55 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I've got the 4, and what I can say about it is...
02:15:17 <AndrsBS[m]> just don't even think about buying the pixel 4, go for the 4a >:D
02:15:20 <johnbillians[m]> this is pretty silly but i havent plugged a phone in to charge in like 2 years, i'd hate to lose wireless charging with the 4a
02:15:36 <TheJollyRoger> It's not a *bad* phone? It's nice and fancy, the screen looks great, and the camera's pretty good (although GrapheneOS can no longer use GCam), and it feels premium.
02:15:49 <TheJollyRoger> But it's *awfully* expensive for what you get.
02:16:03 <AndrsBS[m]> <TheJollyRoger "But it's *awfully* expensive for"> ^
02:16:03 <johnbillians[m]> yeah i'd be buying second hand anyway
02:16:07 <johnbillians[m]> just to avoid supporting google directly
02:16:37 <TheJollyRoger> Be careful buying secondhand devices; we've had a couple people in this channel end up getting ripped off.
02:16:50 <johnbillians[m]> in what way?
02:16:54 <johnbillians[m]> just straight up scammed?
02:17:21 <TheJollyRoger> Well, typically what happens when a phone is delisted from the Google Store, is that the retailers will often immediately try to bail their Verizon handsets for whatever money they can, so they can try to shift the stock before it becomes stale.
02:17:47 <johnbillians[m]> ah, yeah
02:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> This means the market ends up becoming *flooded* with those un-unlockable handsets. Sometimes the vendors may not even know what the difference is between a carrier locked and a bootloader locked handset.
02:18:13 <johnbillians[m]> i'll be going through a site with some kind of "buyers insurance". if they mark it unlocked and it isnt unlocked, ill get it refunded thru the middleman
02:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> Occasionally, the kids packaging the phones don't look at the boxes, or the handsets are missing their original packaging, or are just thrown into any box that fits.
02:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> Good, whew!
02:18:36 <johnbillians[m]> not gonna go anywhere near like LetGo or FB Marketplace
02:18:46 <TheJollyRoger> What's even worse though... and this has happened once on record in this channel,
02:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> Someone bought a used 3, and the vendor was selling it as "unlocked" after having used an exploit to make the toggle appear unlocked.
02:19:19 <TheJollyRoger> But it was a Verizon one.
02:19:25 <johnbillians[m]> oh wow
02:19:28 <johnbillians[m]> thats high effort
02:19:36 <TheJollyRoger> And as soon as the firmware was updated in order for Graphene to be installed on it, that toggle grayed out.
02:20:10 <johnbillians[m]> seriously makes me wonder if doing that was worth the extra time for the seller
02:20:23 <johnbillians[m]> just sell it for $20 less and move on
02:20:28 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know.
02:22:43 <TheJollyRoger> If you're missing the original packaging, the easiest way to tell is to use the get properties command in Android Debug Bridge once the phone has been connected to your PC and USB debugging enabled and the phone trusting the computer's ADB key.
02:22:52 <TheJollyRoger> the command is:
02:22:58 <TheJollyRoger> adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid
02:23:09 <johnbillians[m]> i'll save that for later
02:23:09 <johnbillians[m]> much obliged
02:23:22 <TheJollyRoger> If it's anything except a bunch of zeroes, then that phone has a carrier ID value fused into the chip and it can't be unlocked.
02:23:27 <joltman[m]> The terms "unlocked" or "factory unlocked" are not helpful and should be ignored. They usually just mean that the phone is "carrier unlocked". If the seller doesn't specifically say that the bootloader is unlocked, then avoid.  Getting a screen shot showing that it is unlocked or unlockable is better, but even THAT isn't a guarantee.  I bought one phone where the seller provided a screen shot and I still received a
02:23:27 <joltman[m]> locked Verizon phone and had to return it. I think such sellers are hoping you just won't bother and will simply resell it.
02:24:12 <johnbillians[m]> im trying to avoid those big name phone resellers like "Adopt-a-Phone"
02:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> joltman[m]: yeah, sounds about right.
02:24:46 <johnbillians[m]> i'll bank on the casual sellers who wouldn't think to go out of their way to trick buyers like that
02:25:23 <joltman[m]> Even a guarantee can be sketchy depending on what the seller says. If you buy an "unlocked" phone, the seller can truthfully say that it was unlocked (meaning carrier unlocked).
02:25:43 <TheJollyRoger> Well, the best thing you can do for yourself in this area is pay by card. If the seller won't take back the ends, then you issue a chargeback.
02:25:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:25:57 <TheJollyRoger> Issuing a chargeback not only gets you your money back, but it can hurt unscrupulous sellers because the credit card company will ding them for the chargeback.
02:26:10 <TheJollyRoger> So they're incentivized to work with their buyers.
02:26:29 <joltman[m]> The problem with casual sellers is that they don't know what you're talking about and don't know how to tell if the phone they're selling is bootloader unlocked. It's a lot of educational effort to get the info you need from them.
02:26:42 <johnbillians[m]> I didn't realize the phone could still have its bootloader locked when carrier unlocked
02:26:43 <johnbillians[m]> ... that's an issue
02:26:45 <johnbillians[m]> @joltman
02:27:04 <johnbillians[m]> joltman: exactly
02:27:41 <johnbillians[m]> I'll have to ask the sellers if they bought it straight from Google or not
02:27:41 <joltman[m]> Yes, it's a big problem. I had to buy three phones to get the one I'm currently using, because the first two turned out to be carrier unlocked Verizon phones.
02:27:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's a bit of a roundabout process: phones that are bootloader locked, have a "Carrier ID" set permanently using e-fuses (these can't be modified post-manufacture). The factory operating system will check for the presence of this carrier ID value. If it detects one, it simply refuses to let you budge that toggle.
02:27:57 <johnbillians[m]> Does buying from Google Fi lock the bootloader if purchased from their site?
02:28:28 <TheJollyRoger> The modem which determines what frequencies the phone will and won't connect to is a different matter altogether, we have nothing to do with it.
02:28:35 <strcat[m]> jftn: we don't want some installation program or script
02:28:41 <johnbillians[m]> According to Reddit Google Fi DOES lock them
02:29:09 <johnbillians[m]> so that is YET ANOTHER Issue lol
02:29:14 <TheJollyRoger> johnbillians[m]: buying from the Google store is your safest bet; when you buy from Google, *before* you check out, it will ask you what type of phone you're interested in buying. There, you're going to want to ensure you check "unlocked."
02:29:57 <johnbillians[m]> TheJollyRoger: yeah i know its my best bet but im really trying to avoid supporting Google in that way. I know my impact is small but you know, just out of principle
02:29:58 <johnbillians[m]> i avoid them
02:30:03 <joltman[m]> I also heard that people who bought refurbished phones directly from Google were sometimes getting the locked Verizon model, but I think Google was exchanging those when they complained about it.
02:30:18 <strcat[m]> jftn: you're welcome to work on making a WebUSB-based installer
02:30:51 <joltman[m]> On swappa.com, you can sometimes find a local seller and you can meet them in person to verify that it's unlockable.
02:31:04 <TheJollyRoger> johnbillians[m]: yep, I get you, just that that's the safest bet at the current point in time.
02:31:19 <johnbillians[m]> joltman: unfortunately none of the sellers are near me
02:32:24 <johnbillians[m]> i supposed i could try asking them directly: "does the OEM Unlocking toggle work"
02:32:29 <johnbillians[m]>  * i supposed i could try asking sellers directly: "does the OEM Unlocking toggle work"
02:33:26 <joltman[m]> You can look at the reputations of the swappa.com sellers. Generally, they're more technical there, but do your research and find the highest rated seller you can. Ones that say that the phone pictured is the actual phone you get and have a screen shot proving that it's unlocked are generally better. My first seller there blamed the issue on his suppplier.
02:34:39 <joltman[m]> Yes, you can ask if the OEM Unlocking toggle is off or able to be turned off, but not all sellers know what that means. I once tried to go through all that with an ebay seller and gave up as she was both clueless and suspicious about what I was asking.
02:35:45 <johnbillians[m]> yeah i doubt any of them even know what the developer settings are
02:36:37 <joltman[m]> Sometimes you can find out from the IMEI, but many sellers won't tell you because of the potential fraud.
02:37:11 <johnbillians[m]> swappa specifically doesn't allow sharing it i believwe
02:37:14 <johnbillians[m]>  * swappa specifically doesn't allow sharing it i beliewe
02:37:18 <johnbillians[m]>  * swappa specifically doesn't allow sharing it i believe
02:38:10 <joltman[m]> I think you're correct. It's not safe to tell people or web sites your IMEI.
02:40:16 <joltman[m]> If the seller bought NEW directly from Google store, then, if you believe them, it's probably good.
02:40:50 <joltman[m]> I ask that more to rule out possible locked phones and not so much to guarantee that it's unlocked.
02:55:09 <johnbillians[m]> lol there is a swappa listing of someone trying to walk them through checking the OEM setting
02:55:16 <johnbillians[m]>  * lol there is a swappa listing of someone trying to walk them through checking the OEM unlocking setting
02:55:27 <johnbillians[m]> given the four days of silence, it doesn't seem to be going well
03:08:22 <jandroid[m]> Is there any risk if I enable developer options?
03:10:31 <joltman[m]> I think the risk is mostly what that allows you to do, so if you start playing with the developer options and don't understand what you're doing, you might not like the results.
03:12:20 <jandroid[m]> Ok, but the damage is likely to be less than enabling root, right?
03:12:40 <strcat[m]> there is no option to 'enable root'
03:12:55 <strcat[m]> root is only used for a few very core system processes like init and vold
03:13:17 <strcat[m]> there isn't a toggle for how the system sandboxing and privilege separation works
03:14:06 <joltman[m]> You don't need to and probably don't want to root your phone if you just want to install GrapheneOS on it.
03:14:18 <strcat[m]> a `userdebug` (development) build has adb authentication disabled (unless `ro.adb.secure=1 ` is set for the build), `adb root` and `su` for `adb shell` but there's still no toggle
03:14:24 <strcat[m]> joltman: there is no such thing as doing that with GrapheneOS
03:14:28 <strcat[m]> it would mean you aren't using GrapheneOS
03:14:36 <strcat[m]> this channel is for GrapheneOS, not forks of it
03:15:32 <jandroid[m]> Yes,  I was just wondering how bad  from a security standpoint enabling developer options is, compared to enabling root
03:15:37 <strcat[m]>  * a `userdebug` (development) build has adb authentication disabled (unless `ro.adb.secure=1 ` is set for the build), `adb root` and `su` for `adb shell` but there's still no toggle and it's never exposed to applications - verified boot and the sandbox, etc. still work properly, it only destroys security via adb
03:15:50 <strcat[m]> there is no option to 'enable root' in AOSP or GrapheneOS
03:15:55 <strcat[m]> so it's not clear what you're talking about
03:16:07 <ash[m]1> enabling developer options has no security impact
03:16:10 <strcat[m]> can't compare enabling developing options to a feature that doesn't exist and which you aren't describing in any detail
03:16:14 <ash[m]1> it's what you do with it
03:16:18 <strcat[m]>  * can't compare enabling developer options to a feature that doesn't exist and which you aren't describing in any detail
03:16:31 <strcat[m]> ash: it does have an impact which is why it prompts for your lock method when you do it
03:16:40 <ash[m]1> name one
03:16:44 <strcat[m]> enabling it makes all of it available when the owner profile is unlocked
03:16:49 <strcat[m]> that's why it prompts for the lock method
03:16:49 <ash[m]1> cos i genuinely cant think of any
03:17:04 <strcat[m]> ash: someone that has your phone for a moment can enable adb and plug it into a host + whitelist a key
03:17:06 <strcat[m]> if you have it enabled
03:17:21 <strcat[m]> so someone you trust with your phone for just a moment can essentially backdoor it
03:17:25 <strcat[m]> there's a reason it prompts for your lock method
03:17:36 <ash[m]1> fair enoug
03:17:37 <strcat[m]> whitelisted adb keys do expire after a while now though
03:17:37 <ash[m]1>  * fair enough
03:17:38 <jandroid[m]> I understand there's no option to enable root ,and I don't plan to do it . I believe you can still do it, though not directly.  My question was just to understand the security implication of enabling developer option, that's all
03:17:45 <strcat[m]> jandroid: no, you can't do it
03:17:53 <strcat[m]> jandroid: you're not talking about GrapheneOS so this is off-topic
03:18:11 <strcat[m]> there is no such thing as toggling on root on AOSP or GrapheneOS
03:18:26 <strcat[m]> I suggest talking about other OSes including a fork of GrapheneOS destroying the security model elsewhere
03:18:52 <strcat[m]> we can't compare a non-existent option with no detail provided on how it would work to enabling developer options
03:19:02 <strcat[m]> enabling developer options exists, the other thing you're describing does not and it's not clear what you mean by it
03:19:09 <strcat[m]> I described `userdebug` builds above
03:19:14 <ash[m]1> jandroid:
03:19:17 <ash[m]1> oof
03:19:20 <strcat[m]> a `userdebug` build destroys physical security
03:19:25 <ash[m]1> the disconnect is the same that i just had
03:19:31 <ash[m]1> youre talking about digital secuirty
03:19:37 <ash[m]1> which is what i was talking about
03:19:44 <ash[m]1> strcat:  is talking about physical and digital
03:19:59 <ash[m]1> so a root toggle or a custom version of grapheneos with, for example, magisk
03:20:00 <strcat[m]> ash: many of the developer options are risky beyond physical security
03:20:01 <ash[m]1> are very different
03:20:04 <ash[m]1> one is a toggle
03:20:05 <ash[m]1> one is another
03:20:10 <strcat[m]> developer options are for developers and are not supported for production usage of a device
03:20:33 <strcat[m]> OS and app developers
03:20:39 <madaidan[m]> <jandroid[m] "Yes,  I was just wondering how b"> If you mean exposing app-accessible root in a fork and therefore ruining the security model vs enabling developer options, then developer options is far less bad.
03:20:40 <strcat[m]> none of the options there is meant for production usage
03:20:47 <strcat[m]> every option in there is for app and OS developers
03:21:24 <strcat[m]> use MTP to transfer files, not ADB
03:23:23 <strcat[m]> if you aren't going to be doing app or OS developing or debugging the app or OS, you probably shouldn't be enabling developer options
03:23:31 <ash[m]1> most are, very few arent
03:23:39 <ash[m]1> when youre installing any custom rom you have to enable adb
03:23:44 <strcat[m]> no
03:23:56 <strcat[m]> adb is not used in the installation process for GrapheneOS
03:23:57 <strcat[m]> please don't use unofficial guides
03:24:11 <strcat[m]> OEM unlocking is the only thing used in developer options
03:24:19 <ash[m]1> but yea, most of theme
03:24:20 <strcat[m]> and we recommend disabling developer options once OEM unlocking has been toggled off again
03:24:21 <ash[m]1>  * but yea, most of them are
03:24:50 <strcat[m]> ash: they aren't, those instructions are just flawed
03:25:28 <strcat[m]> and regardless, this is the channel for GrapheneOS
03:26:14 <jandroid[m]> Ok, thanks madaidan.:  strcat
03:26:17 <strcat[m]> on a production device, we strongly recommend against having developer options enabled
03:26:27 <strcat[m]> turn it on to disable OEM unlocking after installing then turn it off again
03:26:51 <strcat[m]> that way enabling any of it requires the lock method even if the owner profile is unlocked already
03:27:13 <strcat[m]> also if ADB is enabled, that's adding substantial attack surface via USB (which is not just physical attack surface - a computer you connect to could be compromised)
03:27:34 <strcat[m]> and if you trust a computer with ADB access, that's exposing massive attack surface via that computer
03:27:44 <strcat[m]> not something you want to do on a production device meant to be highly secure
03:28:32 <strcat[m]> use MTP for file transfer, not ADB
03:29:12 <strcat[m]> or better yet use an app for it and don't give a computer access to a profile's home directory via MTP
03:53:19 <strcat[m]> the install guide has been reformatted to make things clearer, same instructions as before other than obtaining fastboot and signify later on to discourage deviating from the official approach: https://grapheneos.org/install
03:53:44 <strcat[m]> and switched to using `bsdtar` on Linux too as was already being done on macOS and Windows rather than the legacy `unzip` command
03:54:37 <strcat[m]> added a dedicated section on opening a terminal too instead of it being in prerequisites
03:56:49 <strcat[m]> the only way it's going to get simpler is a WebUSB installer
03:56:57 <strcat[m]> fastboot supports WebUSB
03:57:02 <strcat[m]> need developers interested in working on that
05:44:38 <squarmkt[m]> <johnbillians[m] "TheJollyRoger: yeah i know its m"> Look at getting floor model devices at an electronics retailer or something. Usually a little cheaper and can probably check OEM unlocking in store
05:50:53 <TheJollyRoger> squarmkt[m]: Ha, funny you mention that! I bought my Pixel 3 because it had a scuff in one corner and was marked down accordingly.
05:51:09 <TheJollyRoger> Being able to check it was definitely big.
05:51:42 <TheJollyRoger> (Afterward, I took it home and I used a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser to remove the "scuff" which I realized was actually a smear.)
06:03:45 <squarmkt[m]> TheJollyRoger you got luckier than I! Mine looked perfect and marked down accordingyl lol
06:04:14 <squarmkt[m]> * TheJollyRoger  you got luckier than I! Mine looked perfect and marked down accordingly lol

06:50:35 <rny> What needs to happen so vanadium can use the os autofill?
06:51:05 <somenerd[m]> I believe it was disabled upstream
06:51:16 <somenerd[m]> (and made into a Chrome-only feature)
06:53:34 <somenerd[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201127#c5978436
07:01:48 <strcat> somenerd[m]: no, it's just that they seem to prefer only offering the internal autofill in Chromium afaik
07:02:21 <strcat> we disable autofill because of the phishing issues with it
07:02:41 <strcat> sites can abuse it to trick you into providing more information than you realize
07:02:43 <strcat> or accidentally
07:03:00 <strcat> and also they have a ton of fancy autofill features depending on Google services
07:03:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah I remember seeing the old docs about that
07:03:03 <strcat> so we disabled it all
07:03:16 <strcat> they have a cloud service that classifies what kind of information different types of forms take
07:03:20 <strcat> based on machine learning
07:03:31 <strcat> it's kinda neat but it requires using a Google service and is just a bad idea
07:05:48 <Knull[m]> <strcat "we disable autofill because of t"> in vanadium? I remember seeing it on. Turned it off recently, myself
07:06:05 <strcat> it's disabled by default
07:06:10 <strcat> the fancy autofill stuff
07:06:37 <strcat> optionally filling in credit cards / addresses that it can autofill on demand is essentially a separate thing
07:06:55 <strcat> works differently and can be easily just avoided
07:07:00 <strcat> if you don't want it
07:07:37 <strcat> I'm talking about the automatic autofill where it remembers what you filled into fields and tries to offer those as suggestions when filling in similar fields
07:07:49 <strcat> which normally uses a fancy cloud-based machine learning thing to classify types of fields
07:08:09 <strcat> for example maybe it has learned a concept of searching for a torrent, so it knows to offer those suggestions in those kinds of search fields specifically, etc.
07:08:13 <strcat> unsure how sophisticated it is
07:08:18 <strcat> it's not something you'd directly notice
07:08:32 <strcat> other than it offering suggestions based on what you entered before

12:45:23 <knsfjkdsfn> literally nothing
12:45:30 <Liakdeuser[m]> Does it say <waiting for device> or "press any key"?
12:45:31 <knsfjkdsfn> It's like dd without status=progress
12:45:40 <knsfjkdsfn> no
12:45:49 <Liakdeuser[m]> * Does it say `<waiting for device>` or "press any key"?
12:45:57 <knsfjkdsfn> It doesn't
12:46:38 <Liakdeuser[m]> Odd. Did you install the prerequisites from grapheneos.org/install?
12:47:15 <knsfjkdsfn> Yes
12:47:28 <knsfjkdsfn> Do you mean android-tools and android-udev?
12:49:07 <knsfjkdsfn> I think i works now
12:49:22 <knsfjkdsfn> I reset everything
12:49:27 <Liakdeuser[m]> <knsfjkdsfn "Do you mean android-tools and an"> If you're using Arch, yes
12:49:30 <Liakdeuser[m]> <knsfjkdsfn "I think i works now"> Nice
12:49:42 <knsfjkdsfn> started ./flash-all in "normal" android so it said waiting on device
12:49:45 <knsfjkdsfn> and then accessed fastboot
12:51:31 <Liakdeuser[m]> <knsfjkdsfn "and then accessed fastboot"> Yeah, should have booted there
12:51:47 <knsfjkdsfn> I did
12:51:52 <knsfjkdsfn> but it was stuck on fastboot
12:52:02 <knsfjkdsfn> the screen didn't turn on and off
12:53:13 <knsfjkdsfn> It booted into GrapheneOS :D
13:03:05 <demonmachina[m]> neeeeed wickr enterprise.... literally the only thing i actually have to carry a second phone for
13:06:25 <rheaalleen[m]> Back to testing notifications with Threema, since its running without Google Services/microG it uses polling every 15min to get notifications but it seems its a bit wonky. Yesterday worked fine after reinstall and I didnt change a single setting. Today messages wont show even after 15min are over
13:19:41 <ternet> Hi folks, are there any vendors at the moment where I can buy a phone with GrapheneOS already installed?
13:26:49 <duggalsu[m]> Should remote attestation be enabled for all profiles or just the owner?
13:28:23 <demonmachina[m]> Owner.
13:30:42 <demonmachina[m]> @ternet likely not.... If you follow the directions on https://grapheneos.org/install you should be go to do it on your own. No need for someone else to do it for you.
13:30:42 <demonmachina[m]> If you have issues ask them here.... folks will lend a hand
13:31:13 <ternet> demonmachina[m] alright, thank you!
13:35:21 <User78> There is a company in NZ that has phones with Graphene installed, but you pay like 800 USD for them to do it.
13:35:53 <User78> Even for a noob like me who had difficulty it wasn't worth anything like that.
13:36:34 <ternet> User78 care to share the name?
13:39:35 <User78> Ncrypt cellular
13:40:55 <ternet> User78 Thx
13:45:12 <somenerd[m]> wait is that actually legit?
13:45:22 <somenerd[m]> I don't really think so (but not sure)
13:49:22 <Albakham[m]> <User78 "There is a company in NZ that ha"> That's insane!
13:50:30 <Albakham[m]> 1200
13:51:03 <Albakham[m]>  * It's 1200$ for a grapheneos installation lol
13:53:08 <demonmachina[m]> I'll do it for 11
13:53:24 <demonmachina[m]> kidding.... that's bullshit
14:06:58 <r0tt0r[m]> <Albakham[m] "1200"> when 1200 go to graphene project, i call it a win
14:21:16 <ayaen_t[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "when 1200 go to graphene project"> not sure about that it actually goes.
14:22:36 <demonmachina[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "when 1200 go to graphene project"> do I think it's worth it? yeah of course. Do I think it's a waste of money at the same time when the instructions have been made in painstakingly detail so that one can do it themselves? Absolutely
14:24:27 <tim> hello there
14:24:30 <tim> anyone here?
14:24:35 <tim> i need help :(
14:24:39 <tim> please
14:24:51 <Guest71559> hello there
14:24:53 <Guest71559> anyone here
14:24:58 <Guest71559> i need help!
14:24:59 <Guest71559> please
14:25:08 <ayaen_t[m]> what is it
14:25:35 <Guest71559> i got 2 pixel 3a today and i cannot flash graphene for the life of me
14:25:48 <Guest71559> and i am not all that new to flashing as i have used lineage before
14:26:32 <ayaen_t[m]> what happened.why werent you able to
14:26:38 <Guest71559> but the flash all process always stops with the "Sending sparse 'vendor b' 1/3
14:26:48 <Guest71559> FAILED (Error reading sparse file)
14:26:55 <Guest71559> i have no idea
14:27:02 <Guest71559> happens with both phones
14:27:26 <Guest71559> i am on linux mint with fastboot version 30.0.5
14:27:52 <Liakdeuser[m]> Linux mint is not officially supported tho
14:28:03 <Liakdeuser[m]> <Liakdeuser[m] "Linux mint is not officially sup"> for installation
14:28:16 <Guest71559> but can that really be the problem?
14:28:50 <nscnt> Guest71559: What's the name of your factory image you're trying to flash?
14:29:10 <nscnt> Guest71559: Are you actually trying to flash sargo?
14:29:11 <Guest71559> sargo-factory-2020.12.12.03
14:29:18 <Guest71559> yes
14:29:21 <Guest71559> from the beta channel
14:31:28 <nscnt> Hard to tell without knowing all the steps you did and whether you missed something
14:32:38 <Liakdeuser[m]> You have your bash file history from the time you installed the udev rules, set the PATH, etc?
14:32:55 <nscnt> Guest71559: Unlocking the bootloader worked?
14:33:04 <Guest71559> yes unlocking worked fine
14:33:49 <Guest71559> Liakdeuser[m]: sorry, i don't know what you mean :) i am still learning linux
14:34:17 <nscnt> That means fastboot works, bootloader is unlocked and the image is the right one. Let me check something
14:34:47 <strcat[m]> Guest71559: https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting make sure to try this troubleshooting section
14:34:53 <strcat[m]> also make sure to verify the zip you downloaded
14:35:19 <strcat[m]> and the info about USB in https://grapheneos.org/install#prerequisites
14:37:04 <Guest71559> i will try with a different usb slot
14:41:43 <Guest71559> fml that worked
14:41:47 <Guest71559> wtf
14:42:15 <Guest71559> my head was spinning like crazy and i should just have switched the slots
14:54:13 <Guest71559> anyway, thanks for you help guys
14:54:25 <Guest71559> i really appreciate it!
14:54:35 <Guest71559> stay healthy and have a nice day :)
14:55:10 <nscnt> Guest71559: Welcome on board c:
15:18:40 <M23wertgjnm[m]> Hi. I tried to install graphene on my 4a and it is stuck in a cycle saying it cannot find a valid OS and it won't start. I relocked the bootloader but cannot unlock it again from my PC so I'm stuck where I am. Does anyone know how to fix this/ unlock the bootloader again?
15:19:14 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install again
15:19:17 <strcat[m]> top to bottom
15:19:23 <strcat[m]> don't use an unofficial guide
15:19:43 <strcat[m]> make sure to read the information on USB in prerequisites
15:20:12 <strcat[m]> it's not a problem that the OS can't boot - the official guide doesn't do stuff like using adb
15:20:39 <M23wertgjnm[m]> Oh ok thank you very much
15:58:18 <M23wertgjnm[m]> Thank you so so much I have got it working now
16:16:26 <fast1[m]> How do you make use of work profiles in GrapheneOS?
16:24:44 <dar_gomml[m]> <fast1[m] "How do you make use of work prof"> e.g. the app "shelter" on f-droid
16:34:40 <thematrix5000[m]> What are work profiles for
16:39:42 <r0tt0r[m]> <thematrix5000[m] "What are work profiles for"> isolate apps from profile data like contacts for example
16:43:41 <thematrix5000[m]> You have to use shelter?
16:50:31 <dar_gomml[m]> <thematrix5000[m] "You have to use shelter?"> or some "enterprise mobile device management platform"
17:01:14 <rheaalleen[m]> Im getting wireless emergency broadcasts?
17:04:07 <rheaalleen[m]> Huh, interesting, enabled by default even tho not US based
17:11:25 <r0tt0r[m]> <thematrix5000[m] "You have to use shelter?"> no, theres also island app or just plain android management
17:15:55 <strcat[m]> rheaalleen: there's also no toggle for presidential alerts (by law) and Canada uses presidential alerts for all kinds of alerts
17:16:05 <strcat[m]> really annoying
17:16:32 <strcat[m]> they send amber alerts as presidential alerts to make a siren noise and prevent regular users from disabling it
17:18:16 <strcat[m]> the way it works is regional
17:18:43 <strcat[m]> part of the settings that are regional too
17:18:59 <strcat[m]> some countries have some really stupid laws like disallowing setting your headphones to max volume
17:20:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> There was something like that on the PSVita here
17:20:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> To protect children's ears
17:20:27 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/57a501f9511faebaa02f2cbc36ce13a5af0f2eca
17:20:41 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon🖤‍❤️🏳️‍🌈: it's required by law in some countries
17:21:14 <Kurai> even Walkman’s, a dedicated music device, have the volume cap in europe
17:21:20 <Kurai> pretty funny
17:22:48 <johnbillians[m]> it's an EU law I believe
17:34:45 <Yzordderrex[m]> I am from the EU, now living in the States, more and more the EU sounds to me like EWW🤮
17:34:45 <Golli[m]> So does open-source software have to follow these laws then?
17:37:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> All of the major western nations suck.
17:37:14 <Golli[m]> I mean, a law to lower the volume of your device is stupid.
17:37:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> No point discussing a race to the bottom.
17:37:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
17:37:54 <ayaen_t[m]> maybe take this to  off topic now that its getting political ?
17:42:10 <ash[m]1> iirc community open source projects dont have to follow laws of specific countries as they dont have a project home
17:42:13 <ash[m]1> but i could be completely wrong
17:55:03 <solarhors[m]> Hello! Sorry if I'm interrupting the conversation. I'm currently in the process of installing GrapheneOS and I'm having troubles with the flash-all.sh script. After I launch it there is no output in the terminal and Pixel 4a stays in Fastboot mode. Could anyone give me some advice on how this can be fixed?
18:00:57 <Liakdeuser[m]> Have you installed the udev rules?
18:01:07 <randmlee[m]> I'm an iPhone user and never used an android phone. looking at acquiring a 4a and wanted to know my options for keeping/copying data over. I know google and samsung have a migration process, but is that available on all android/AOSP and therefore available on grapheneos? I can't find anything on this specifically. thanks for confirming or pointing me in the right direction
18:02:21 <Liakdeuser[m]> <solarhors[m] "Hello! Sorry if I'm interrupting"> https://grapheneos.org/install#fastboot-as-non-root
18:02:29 <solarhors[m]> Lia, I have both android-tools and android-udev packages installed.
18:02:35 <johnbillians[m]> randmlee: from iphone to android? or from android to android?
18:03:02 <randmlee[m]> <johnbillians[m] "randmlee: from iphone to android"> iphone to android. sorry if that wasn't clear
18:04:31 <johnbillians[m]> randmlee: unfortunately, the only solutions for that that i know of are proprietary apps that come with Pixel or Samsung phones (with their OEM OS's, not with GrapheneOS installed)
18:04:36 <johnbillians[m]> you're gonna have to do this manually
18:07:39 <randmlee[m]> <johnbillians[m] "randmlee: unfortunately, the onl"> OK. so is it possible to xfer to google's os on pixel, then like back that up, load grapheneos and then transfer from backup?
18:09:54 <johnbillians[m]> randmlee: that's not a bad idea! though you are handing over your data to google in doing so. if you're cool with that, look into SeedVault. GrapheneOS comes bundled with SeedVault (disabled by default), so that should work pretty smoothly if you back up your data with Seedvault after transferring your iPhone data but before installing GrapheneOS
18:10:13 <COVID-1984> johnbillians[m]: this is definitely the biggest pain point. I just started fresh with GOS and slowly transferred stuff over.
18:10:14 <johnbillians[m]>  * randmlee: that's not a bad idea! though you are handing over your data to google in doing so*. if you're cool with that, look into SeedVault. GrapheneOS comes bundled with SeedVault (disabled by default), so that should work pretty smoothly if you back up your data with Seedvault after transferring your iPhone data but before installing GrapheneOS

18:13:53 <randmlee[m]>  * Oh. so in order to xfer from iphone to to GOS, i would have to have a google account and connect to it, eh?
18:14:21 <johnbillians[m]> randmlee: im not entirely sure how the Pixel's transfer app works, I've never used it myself
18:14:30 <johnbillians[m]> it may require a google account yeah
18:15:20 <randmlee[m]> i see. i will check out seed vault. i think i read about it a while back and forgot about it
18:29:27 <Liakdeuser[m]> <solarhors[m] "Lia, I have both android-tools a"> Yeah, have you tried using other usb ports or cables then rerunning the whole thing again?
18:30:43 <randmlee[m]> i think manually moving contacts, photos and notes/docs is fairly straight forward. I just have a hard time finding what can be done for sms/messages and call log. I remember at&t having some contraption to do this years ago.
18:35:05 <solarhors[m]> Lia (kde user), Thank you for your help! I was able to resolve the problem by disconnecting the phone while terminal is occupied with the script and waiting until a message saying "waiting for any device" appears and re-connecting the phone. The script executed after and the installation finished without errors for me.
18:36:30 <johnbillians[m]> randmlee: there's no non-hacky way to transfer iMessage
18:36:36 <johnbillians[m]> b/c of the end to end encryption
18:40:46 <randmlee[m]> yeah i realize that. if i can get isms2droid (or like it) w/o google play, then i think it could be ok. i think e2e encryption is moot if you have physical access to db, right?
18:56:06 <randmlee[m]> oof, the privacy policy on isms2droid is...not good. nvm
19:02:48 <johnbillians[m]> randmlee: yeah it's moot if you have the keys (i.e. your phone is unlocked) but that doesnt change the fact that its locked down by iOS. i have no idea how those apps even work
19:03:08 <johnbillians[m]> if you have a Mac, your iMessages are in a SQLite database at ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/chat.db
19:05:25 <Liakdeuser[m]> I'd suggest to continue it at #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org as it is already getting quite unrelated to GrapheneOS
19:05:34 <randmlee[m]> yep. just have to convert the sqlitedb to a format that can be imported/read by android
19:05:35 <Liakdeuser[m]> On exporting messages and call logs
19:06:26 <randmlee[m]> <Liakdeuser[m] "I'd suggest to continue it at #g"> i disagree, but OK
19:07:24 <johnbillians[m]> i'd say data transfer is pretty relevant if its specifically to get data into grapheneOS
19:07:51 <Liakdeuser[m]> Quite tangential
19:08:22 <Liakdeuser[m]> Still relevant, but asking for support on more in-line with it could get buried, like flashing support

21:32:34 <ddddxd[m]> my device is in fastboot mode right now
21:34:36 <johnbillians[m]> do `fastboot --version`
21:34:43 <johnbillians[m]> what does it say
21:35:17 <ddddxd[m]> 30.0.5-6877874
21:35:45 <ddddxd[m]> i was using some crappy ole thinkpad usb ports so im gonna switch over to a windows machine
21:36:02 <johnbillians[m]> yeah do that
21:36:03 <ddddxd[m]> i just need to figure out how to start from a cleaner slate
21:38:07 <ddddxd[m]> do i attempt to reflash the device or do i need to go into recovery mode
21:38:33 <ddddxd[m]> in unlocked fastboot
21:45:59 <johnbillians[m]> ddddxd: i cant answer but hang tight, someone will
21:47:52 <ddddxd[m]> recovery mode is a no lol just tried
21:50:12 <johnbillians[m]> what was the last command you performed
21:50:16 <nscnt> ddddxd[m]: Just start from the beginning when you're on your Windows machine
21:52:28 <ddddxd[m]> i will
21:54:25 <ddddxd[m]> my device isn’t recognized
21:54:44 <nscnt> ddddxd[m]: On Windows 10?
21:54:53 <ddddxd[m]> im trying fastboot flashing unlock even though mine already is unlocked
21:55:05 <ddddxd[m]> or whenever i type adb devices
21:55:14 <ddddxd[m]> win 10 makes the noise when i plug it in
21:55:22 <nscnt> ddddxd[m]: adb isn't mentioned to use
21:55:36 <ddddxd[m]> o nvm
21:55:49 <nscnt> ddddxd[m]: In Windows Update, there might be optional update for the driver
21:57:07 <ddddxd[m]> ill check

22:00:47 <johnbillians[m]> windows updates won't have anything to do with the pixel
22:01:07 <nscnt> That's not what I was saying
22:01:10 <johnbillians[m]> its just important to have your OS up to date b/c thats what the instructions over at https://grapheneos.org/install are expecting
22:01:29 <ddddxd[m]> i updated windows
22:02:04 <nscnt> ddddxd[m]: You typed in 'fastboot flashing unlock' and just says <waiting for device>, right?
22:02:37 <ddddxd[m]> yea but its already in fastboot mode
22:03:06 <ddddxd[m]> i did it when it was in fastboot just to be meticulous and follow instruction
22:03:26 <nscnt> If there's no driver updates as well, it might be some general connectivity issue
22:04:03 <ddddxd[m]> using a usb-c to usb-a connector
22:04:16 <nscnt> Cable or connector?
22:04:26 <ddddxd[m]> cable i mean
22:04:31 <johnbillians[m]> no hub, right?
22:04:36 <ddddxd[m]> no hub
22:04:45 <johnbillians[m]> is the phone charging?
22:04:55 <ddddxd[m]> think so
22:05:03 <ddddxd[m]> well there’s no battery indicator on fastboot
22:05:08 <johnbillians[m]> hmm
22:12:47 <johnbillians[m]> do you have any other devices you can verify the cable works with?
22:14:54 <ddddxd[m]> i have an mp3 player that runs on some linux thing it works
22:15:05 <ddddxd[m]> but im switching to full type c right now on another machine
22:19:56 <ddddxd[m]> how long would it take to flash the image onto the phone usually
22:20:26 <thematrix5000[m]> Mine took like 5 mins
22:20:39 <ddddxd[m]> ty
22:28:07 <ddddxd[m]> rn i got no command
22:28:11 <ddddxd[m]> waiting for device
22:28:36 <ddddxd[m]> no command on android screen with  the dying android thing
22:29:00 <ddddxd[m]> might’ve bricked
22:32:25 <johnbillians[m]> that is uncommon
22:35:02 <ddddxd[m]> i shouldnt have used crap usb ports
22:35:17 <ddddxd[m]> ill try to recover the device
22:58:44 <ddddxd[m]> my plan is to reflash stock android on the device and then put graphene on
23:00:31 <JCD[m]> Is using a video to assist me on installing Graphene OS a bad idea?
23:00:43 <ddddxd[m]> id say yes
23:00:54 <ddddxd[m]> things change over time
23:01:06 <ddddxd[m]> the site is pretty straightforward
23:01:20 <JCD[m]> Okay.
23:01:56 <JCD[m]> I was just asking before I use a video to install it once I get my phone.
23:13:02 <LinusSexTips[m]> Just follow the instructions on the site and ask here if you have any questions/problems and people will help
23:13:46 <JCD[m]> Got it.
23:14:01 <JCD[m]> Now to wait to get my phone as a present.
23:49:19 <liamobrien[m]> New here, I have been testing out Graphene and Calyx, one major thing I'm able to do in Calyx that I'm wondering if Graphene can do, with Calyx when connected to a VPN (ProtonVPN via app) and tethering/hotspot is enabled, the hotspot data and the phone data goes via the VPN, however with Graphene with the same VPN (ProtonVPN via app), ONLY the phone's data goes via the VPN and the hotspot data DOESN'T. Does anyone
23:49:20 <liamobrien[m]> know who to enable hotspot data to route via VPN when VPN is connected?
23:52:44 <strcat[m]> it works like AOSP in GrapheneOS
23:52:54 <strcat[m]> you need to enable the VPN on the client device
23:53:31 <strcat[m]> you're welcome to work on implementing a toggle for that but we need a proper implementation meeting the standards of the project
23:58:15 <strcat[m]> seems more like a minor convenience than a 'major feature' and it has consequences including losing tethering hardware acceleration so there will be a major impact on battery life
23:58:27 <strcat[m]> there are reasons to want the AOSP behavior
23:59:09 <strcat[m]> so you can use a different VPN on clients, including a different server
23:59:27 <strcat[m]> we wouldn't change the default
23:59:51 <strcat[m]> we've had an issue open about adding a toggle for a long time, but there is not much interest from the community in the feature, you're the first person to mention it
