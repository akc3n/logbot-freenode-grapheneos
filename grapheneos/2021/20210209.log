00:22:18 <thetranstocommie> so, what's the reason distributions like LineageOS don't re-lock the bootloader on Pixels? why is it only calyx and graphene that do it?
00:23:18 <rny> they dont care about security.
00:23:38 <thetranstocommie> my bad meant to send that in off topic
00:24:05 <bethefriction[m]> Hello all, I am trying to download f-droid on a second user profile on the 4a but I keep getting a msg saying "app not installed" anyone experience that issue?
00:25:02 <louipc> yea you need to install them on the main one first
00:25:25 <bethefriction[m]> Yes I've done that
00:25:44 <nscnt[m]> Nah, F-Droid provides a lower version apk on their main page
00:25:50 <louipc> oh not sure
00:26:15 <bethefriction[m]> So its because the versions don't match up?
00:26:19 <nscnt[m]> You need to install the latest from the F-Droid app page
00:26:43 <take_a_deep_brea> <nscnt[m] "Nah, F-Droid provides a lower ve"> true, lmao
00:26:50 <thetranstocommie> <bethefriction[m] "Hello all, I am trying to downlo"> I was having issues with my package manager earlier too. could it be related?
00:26:50 <nscnt[m]> bethefriction: yu
00:26:56 <nscnt[m]> yup
00:28:09 <nscnt[m]> Well, they don't need to match. You just can't downgrade.
00:28:26 <nscnt[m]> Same version or higher
00:28:30 <bethefriction[m]> OK thanks. So the app page is still at f-droid.org?
00:29:00 <bethefriction[m]> I only saw the apk there but didn't explore extensively
00:29:39 <sphinxcat[m]> bethefriction: https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid
00:30:47 <bethefriction[m]> Thank you üòâ
00:31:10 <mr_hebi_san[m]> You have to explicitly go to the latest version's page. Its kinda frustrating that they do this
01:23:12 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Question : is it a bug or is it expected behavior that adding a user account can wipe out biometric logins for the owner account?
01:24:10 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I somehow lost my fingerprint on Owner after adding a user but I don't know what I did as user that might have caused that
01:27:07 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I think it was after User added a lock screen pin
01:31:20 <rny> are you sure? if so, please reproduce
01:31:36 <rny> and then create an issue on GH with steps to re-produce
01:34:22 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It was on the previous stable release.  I'll see if I can make it happen again, and if not on this phone I've got another on the way that I'll try
02:06:42 <SwankyBarbecue4[> <anupritaisno1[m] "images.jpeg"> hahah is this hilarious
02:43:03 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <rny "are you sure? if so, please repr"> I'm not reproducing in today's stable.  But I promise you that I didn't just randomly delete my original fingerprint biometrics or disable fingerprint reader.  Yet somehow the biometric data was completely gone.
02:46:50 <rny> mr_hebi_san[m]: you'll need to be able to re-produce it and record the steps, otherwise we dont know how to trigger the bug you have encountered.
02:47:15 <rny> sadly, that's how bug-fixing works
02:48:08 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Yes, i'm well aware :)
02:49:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It was with the first alternate user I created, and with this current phone I'm a little reluctant to factory reset after all the setup just to get a clean slate for reproduciton.  However, I should have a new phone to throw this onto in a few days and I'll make an effort to reproduce it there
02:49:51 <mr_hebi_san[m]>  * It was with the first alternate user I created, and with this current phone I'm a little reluctant to factory reset after all the setup I've done just to get a clean slate for reproduciton.  However, I should have a new phone to throw this onto in a few days and I'll make an effort to reproduce it there
02:51:52 <rny> if you can capture the logs also, that'll be great
02:53:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Should I do this with logcat or do you have a log capturing utility built in besides logcat?
02:53:47 <mr_hebi_san[m]> (I sincerely hope it's the former)
02:59:12 <take_a_deep_brea> no , just logcat
02:59:45 <mr_hebi_san[m]>  whew!
03:07:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I don't know if this is directly GrapheneOS related, but I am curious how the GrapheneOS security model stands up in this specific case, especially given the security model of Vanadium.  Would this exploit effect it?  Would it effect other browsers besides Vanadium on the OS?  Is the exploit even exploitable on GrapheneOS?
03:07:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/android-barcode-scanner-with-10-million-downloads-infects-users/
03:08:53 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Bearing in mind you'd need to dig into Aurora Store to even grab such an app, and also bearing in mind the question of whether you'd even want it in the first place before it was co-opted to the dark side, of course.
03:14:14 <duck[m]> Don‚Äôt install random apps
03:15:01 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Obviously the safest code is the code that never runs.  My curiosity though is about the exploit
03:15:17 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: what exploit? what does it have to do with Vanadium?
03:15:32 <strcat[m]> the article you linked doesn't appear to have any relevance to what you just said
03:16:22 <mr_hebi_san[m]> The app installed on the phone appears to have had the effect of causing users to experience ads pop up in, assumedly, their browsers.  Let me read again to make sure I understand
03:16:24 <strcat[m]> no exploit there
03:17:06 <green[m]> Is Vanadium & Bromite at feature parity? Is there any useful reason to use Bromite on GrapheneOS?
03:17:20 <strcat[m]> covered in our docs
03:20:41 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <strcat[m] "the article you linked doesn't a"> This was the line from the article that made me wonder what the app was actually doing and what it was exploiting in the Android phones :
03:20:52 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: an app developer selling their app to another party which adds phishing ads, etc. to it isn't an exploit
03:21:08 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: buying an app from a developer isn't an exploit
03:21:20 <strcat[m]> it's not on-topic for the channel
03:22:13 <green[m]> Ok just checking, since the docs mentioned Vanadium & Bromite would converge, wasn't sure if that happened yet
03:22:31 <duck[m]> better fingerprinting protection
03:22:54 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: an app displaying malicious ads isn't an exploit
03:26:13 <strcat[m]> there's no indication of any app or browser exploit in that article - don't really know what you're talking about
03:26:14 <strcat[m]> they're talking about an app developer selling their app or including an SDK in it which serves malicious ads
03:26:20 <strcat[m]> as they say there, adware
03:28:20 <green[m]> Is Bromite's antifingerprinting features integration to Vanadium high or low priority for GrapheneOS?
03:28:55 <strcat[m]> I think you're misunderstanding what needs to be done
03:29:20 <strcat[m]> the features are often not implemented in a way that we would want
03:29:31 <strcat[m]> or have issues we'd need to address, or are counterproductive
03:29:50 <strcat[m]> it's not a task of copy-pasting stuff over
03:30:30 <green[m]> Sounds like refactoring?
03:30:42 <strcat[m]> no
03:30:47 <strcat[m]> that's not what refactoring means
03:31:28 <green[m]> Example of what issues need to be addressed in Bromite? To help me understand
03:31:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> Off topic
03:32:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
03:32:16 <green[m]> I disagree
03:32:20 <hypokeimenon[m]> You can actually read some of the Github issues to get a sense of these though.
03:32:22 <strcat[m]> it's not off-topic I'm just not available to answer questions unless they plan on working on it
03:33:02 <green[m]> OK fair enough
03:33:33 <strcat[m]> Vanadium does have an issue tracker with information
03:33:50 <strcat[m]> not available to provide details case-by-case for each thing
03:34:28 <strcat[m]> we don't want all of the changes just a subset
03:34:52 <strcat[m]> and as I said above some are counterproductive or need changes to fit our requirements
03:35:06 <green[m]> üëç will take a look at Vanadium's issue tracker
03:35:22 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <strcat[m] "there's no indication of any app"> That's fair if you consider it off topic here.  No hard feelings
03:35:54 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: you're just bringing up adware
03:36:05 <take_a_deep_brea> <strcat[m] "we don't want all of the changes"> even a subset would be work in terms of maintenance . and its not like relevant feature requests wont keep coming .
03:36:10 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: an app displaying malicious ads because someone paid for them to put that into it isn't an exploit
03:36:31 <take_a_deep_brea> more like social engineering ?
03:36:50 <somenerd[m]> it's just paying for malicious ads
03:36:53 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Yeah I think that's a fair way to put it
03:36:57 <somenerd[m]> no social engineering
03:36:57 <strcat[m]> I don't think discussing the problem of apps/extensions being bought etc. is on-topic here
03:37:04 <somenerd[m]> yeah I agree
03:37:14 <somenerd[m]> isn't really offtopic
03:37:21 <strcat[m]> since it's not a technical issue
03:38:25 <somenerd[m]> true
03:39:15 <mr_hebi_san[m]> That makes sense.  Thanks for the clarification and I'll try to keep to the strictly technical in this channel
03:40:40 <rny> i like using adware
03:40:43 <rny> :O
03:45:26 <zzxx123> your browser will always be  unique  enough to track
03:46:04 <zzxx123> no matter what amount of anti fingerprinting are there
03:47:22 <zzxx123> just use tor when you need any anonymity
03:47:55 <take_a_deep_brea> zzxx123: off-topic . nothing wrong if you wanna discuss it in some length in the other room though . that way you dont run the risk of being cut in the middle by someone else .
04:04:47 <strcat[m]> zzxx123: that statement is self-contradictory
04:05:14 <strcat[m]> but the issue is that deviating more from others makes the fingerprint more unique
04:13:59 <strcat[m]> so that makes it unclear what Vanadium should do in that regard right now
04:14:08 <strcat[m]> and it just isn't particularly relevant until we have a lot more users
04:14:38 <zzxx123> It's only useful if the set of anti fingerpriting are used about enough people
04:15:06 <zzxx123> used by enough people
04:15:07 <strcat[m]> that's why it's not really relevant atm
04:15:36 <strcat[m]> there's not much point in Vanadium deviating from Chromium with anti-fingerprinting stuff that makes it very clear it's a specific other browser
04:15:42 <strcat[m]> we don't have enough users
04:17:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> Crowd cover
04:19:06 <zzxx123> and implenting them will probably do more harm for now
04:19:26 <zzxx123> as it will give users a false sense of safety
04:21:18 <zzxx123> implementing*
04:21:21 <take_a_deep_brea> true
04:22:09 <somenerd[m]> There are a few nice mitigations though
04:22:28 <somenerd[m]> ex: battery level API being stubbed, sensors access removed
04:22:47 <somenerd[m]> here's a few of them: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/tree/11/patches
07:00:28 <grabba[m]> A read only browser would be nice for this
07:00:31 <grabba[m]> https://github.com/jonasstrehle/supercookie
07:01:15 <grabba[m]> Supercookies persist on vanadium I believe and are the images less than 1mb after wiping browser data
07:12:36 <happy-1[m]> So for the developers what is the future for graphene os would it be possible to have a phone built from the ground up to run your software and sell these or will it always be the pixal devices only
07:13:23 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#roadmap
07:13:26 <somenerd[m]> this is the roadmap
07:13:45 <somenerd[m]> custom hardware is also planned afaict
07:15:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> <happy-1[m] "So for the developers what is th"> If you're interested in something like this happening, then try to raise awareness about the project.
07:15:28 <somenerd[m]> I think that they're just asking
07:15:43 <TheLoneWanderer[> <grabba[m] "Supercookies persist on vanadium"> Tried it on bromite. Got different ID after wiping everything
07:19:15 <hasnoname[m]> Read somewhere a while ago that even when network access to an app is disabled, they can simply sent intent to other apps. Is it still the same? If I install gboard/Swiftkey and disable its network, can they still send/receive data through other apps?
07:19:48 <somenerd[m]> they can send an intent
07:19:57 <somenerd[m]> but the other app also has to consent
07:20:42 <somenerd[m]> so it's a matter of if you trust the other apps with network access
07:20:46 <take_a_deep_brea> hasnoname:  network permission toggle is specific to graphene and is intended to mitigate accessto network via intents too , if i remember correctly .
07:20:54 <AppAraat[m]> Anyone here using Syncthing? Are you also getting a lot of "Operation not permitted" errors on files?
07:20:57 <somenerd[m]> don't think it does
07:21:01 <somenerd[m]> > Anyone here using Syncthing? Are you also getting a lot of "Operation not permitted" errors on files?
07:21:01 <somenerd[m]> bit offtopic

07:21:27 <hasnoname[m]> <hasnoname[m] "Read somewhere a while ago that "> Could not understand what indirect access meant in the graphene faq
07:22:23 <somenerd[m]> >Revoking the permission denies indirect access via OS components and apps enforcing the INTERNET permission, such as DownloadManager. Direct access is denied by blocking low-level network socket access.
07:23:12 <somenerd[m]> IPC still works afaict

07:41:46 <Yesha> Hello, i do have a problem with the dialer app. 2 words are not correctly translated to german. First of all the Contacts Button and furthermore the Call History Menu Button next to the settings. I have found the matching strings on github but they seem to be correctly translated. I hoped they would be wrong so that i can propose a file change and
07:41:46 <Yesha> create a pull request.
07:42:26 <Yesha> Me and my wife do use a pixel 4a.
07:47:14 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
09:24:42 <AppAraat[m]> Wait. Is the colon character (`:`) not allowed for filenames?
09:26:45 <AppAraat[m]> If so, is this a recent change?
09:30:05 <take_a_deep_brea> AppAraat:  https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/FileUtils.java;l=972?q=isValidFatFilenameChar
09:30:11 <take_a_deep_brea> hope that helps
09:31:46 <take_a_deep_brea> the highlighted part is the function which approves of characters in a file name
09:35:37 <asd> Hey. Do anybody know how to backup with seed vault different user profiles?
09:37:02 <mynacol[m]> asd: If I understood it correctly, one profile cannot back up data from another profile. But each profile can set up their own backups individually
09:38:22 <amjjma> mynacol[m]: Seedvault works only in the owner profile. If I switch the profile, seed vault won't work.
09:42:19 <AppAraat[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "AppAraat:  https://cs.android.co"> Interesting. Thanks. For some reason I don't recall colon chars causing any issues in filenames. Must be my wonky memory heh.
09:48:40 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem .
09:48:56 <take_a_deep_brea> got that link from stack overflow
09:51:28 <dazinism> asd: amjjma it is possible to enable seedvault backups for secondary user profiles https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Backups
09:52:09 <dazinism> Safest way to enter the adb commands is from another GrapheneOS phone
09:52:44 <dazinism> https://github.com/KhunHtetzNaing/ADB-OTG
09:53:54 <dazinism> Restoring backups to a secondary profile will take extra 'tricks'
09:54:33 <dazinism> Oh yeah. I've not tried taking backup from secondary profile yet... should really test that.
09:55:03 <dazinism> I'll add info about restoring to a secondary profile to the wiki.
09:56:42 <dazinism> Acrually, I think, that if the seedvault backup is available when you install an app, which is in the backup, seedvault should install your backup data at the same time.
09:57:01 <amjjma> dazinism Thank you for your help.
09:57:05 <dazinism> Same as happens in main user profile
09:57:11 <take_a_deep_brea> dazinism:  interesting app that one .
09:59:46 <dazinism> take_a_deep_breath: yeah, somewhat helps against the security hole that is opened up by using adb
10:00:35 <dazinism> Guess the best security advice would still be to avoid using adb if at all possible.
10:01:52 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah , its after all a debug bridge , and the understanding is that you want to hear all the chatter
10:02:58 <somenerd[m]> > got that link from stack overflow
10:02:58 <somenerd[m]> https://cs.android.com is actually pretty cool for searching through code
10:03:11 <take_a_deep_brea> yeahh
10:03:32 <take_a_deep_brea> i just discovered it ...
10:03:36 <somenerd[m]> Google's rather friendly to devs
10:03:57 <take_a_deep_brea> i mean i knew it was there for chromium , but android one i just found out
10:04:33 <dazinism> take_a_deep_breath: its not so much the chatter, more the huge trust that has to be placed in the device that you are granting adb access
10:05:07 <dazinism> adb can do *so much* stuff to your phone
10:05:42 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah , but i thought the chatter would contain compromising info too ...

15:49:30 <Rentapest> Hi. I am hoping someone might be able to help unlock the bootloader on my Pixel 3XL so I can install Graphene OS, please. I've hit a wall it seems

16:13:36 <manjusri[m]> I've asked this question on the Off Topic channel but I guess it is GrapheneOS related so hopefully me posting the question here is ok. Here goes
16:13:37 <manjusri[m]> hey guys, I've installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3 yesterday and am quite happy with it, I do have one application left which I kinda need to have working and it seems it's requiring Google Play Services. I'm sure this has been asked a few times, though from my search I did not find any answer neither here nor on the GrapheneOS channel. What are my options?
16:14:27 <somenerd[m]> trying an alternative may help
16:14:29 <somenerd[m]> also it
16:14:39 <somenerd[m]>  * also it's tangentially related, so it is offtopic
16:15:11 <manjusri[m]> ok sorry, I'll remove it then.
16:15:18 <somenerd[m]> no need
16:16:14 <take_a_deep_brea> manjusri:  maybe there is a web version of the app ? some kind of cloud service ? bank app >?
16:17:51 <faxing[m]> <manjusri[m] "hey guys, I've installed Graphen"> Try to find an alternative or use the PWA
16:17:53 <manjusri[m]> that seems like a logical option to have but it's for a banking service specific to my country and they don't offer any alternatives
16:17:54 <faxing[m]> if neither of those are an option, it might be worth looking into sacrificing some security and going with CalyxOS
16:18:14 <faxing[m]> Calyx allows for MicroG but I don't think I can go into any more detaul than that in this room

16:18:21 <take_a_deep_brea> faxing:  please do not promote calyx OS here
16:18:23 <somenerd[m]> CalyxOS isn't exactly recommended here
16:18:38 <faxing[m]> Wasnt promoting it in any way
16:18:44 <somenerd[m]> due to the projects not being friendly to each other
16:18:57 <faxing[m]> I said if you're fine with sacrificing security - I use graphene daily
16:19:02 <take_a_deep_brea> i see'
16:19:09 <somenerd[m]> yeah I see what you mean
16:19:19 <manjusri[m]> I've tried the other options and am sticking with Graphene, kudos to the team!
16:19:25 <faxing[m]> how are they not friendly with each other? I thought c/////head was the only real problem?
16:19:34 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry if i made a wrong implication
16:19:55 <somenerd[m]> a lot of problems
16:19:56 <faxing[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "sorry if i made a wrong implicat"> No all good, I worded it poorly
16:20:05 <somenerd[m]> relating to techlore
16:20:09 <somenerd[m]> and a few other things
16:20:21 <faxing[m]> Oh?
16:20:30 <faxing[m]> Is there anywhere where I could learn about the situation or?
16:20:41 <somenerd[m]> not sure, it's a mess in general
16:20:50 <somenerd[m]> search logbot maybe?
16:22:54 <faxing[m]> I'll try to find something out, thanks.
16:23:01 <somenerd[m]> strcat's talked a bit about the situation before in this room (or maybe even the offtopic)
16:23:12 <take_a_deep_brea> faxing: its not just some security . calyx does not really have any of grapheneOS hardening , either that  or they are bent on keeping their security work a secret
16:23:15 <hypokeimenon[m]> this doesn't seem pertinent to techincal discussions about the OS
16:23:35 <take_a_deep_brea> hypokeimenonüñ§‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: good point
16:23:36 <take_a_deep_brea> sorry
16:23:38 <somenerd[m]> true
16:23:46 <take_a_deep_brea> sometimes one just gets carried away
16:23:56 <faxing[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "faxing: its not just some securi"> I thought Calyx maintained the security model of AOSP while stripping out the gatbage telemetry, which Graphene greatly improved upon the privacy and security model of AOSP
16:23:58 <faxing[m]> is that false?
16:24:06 <faxing[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "this doesn't seem pertinent to t"> You're right, sorry.
16:24:13 <somenerd[m]> no need to strip out anything in AOSP
16:24:18 <somenerd[m]> since it's already degoogled
16:24:49 <take_a_deep_brea> faxing:  aosp does not have any telemetry . as far as i know
16:25:26 <m2tu[m]> anyone can help me with some questions regarding to build from aosp
16:25:43 <somenerd[m]> bit offtopic
16:25:46 <motovate[m]> can someone please let me know where to get apps from - other than fdroid? I downloaded Signal from signal.org. Is that the best way to install Signal? tia
16:25:54 <faxing[m]> Yes
16:26:03 <m2tu[m]> Aurora store download from f-droid
16:26:11 <m2tu[m]> or if u want forked signal
16:26:15 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for offtopic discussions
16:26:16 <m2tu[m]> use mollyim
16:26:16 <motovate[m]> thank you
16:26:18 <faxing[m]> Sign the APK from Signal's site, get everything else from F-Droid
16:26:36 <motovate[m]> <faxing[m] "Sign the APK from Signal's site,"> thanks
16:26:36 <somenerd[m]> *get the signed APK
16:26:37 <m2tu[m]> u can set specific password to delete db
16:26:52 <faxing[m]> Molly is against ToS and not necessarily proven to be as trustworthy
16:26:52 <somenerd[m]> not sign the APK
16:26:55 <faxing[m]> I'd hold out
16:27:14 <faxing[m]> <somenerd[m] "not sign the APK "> Yeah sorry, trying to multitask here lol
16:27:35 <somenerd[m]> think that Signal was ok with Molly using the servers
16:27:39 <somenerd[m]> don't have a source though
16:27:42 <m2tu[m]> anyone have build aosp?
16:27:43 <faxing[m]> > <@lelmister101:matrix.org> not sign the APK
16:27:44 <faxing[m]>  * Yeah sorry, trying to multitask and it's not working out well lol
16:27:51 <somenerd[m]> very offtopic though
16:28:17 <faxing[m]> Signal hasn't taken down Molly yet, though they have publicly shown a disliking to other clients "leeching" off of their servers.
16:28:25 <faxing[m]> <somenerd[m] "very offtopic though"> Yes, you're right
16:28:30 <m2tu[m]> i try to build debug for debugging but when all build finish i cant find any output file from it ?
16:28:45 <somenerd[m]> this is offtopic
16:28:54 <somenerd[m]> don't think that people have built AOSP here
16:29:03 <somenerd[m]> (maybe so though, idrk)
16:29:16 <m2tu[m]> ok ahve to wait for admisn than
16:30:25 <manjusri[m]> <motovate[m] "can someone please let me know w"> in f-droid you will find Aurora Store, which will allow you to anonymously download from the Google Play store. I've only discovered it yesterday so cannot say if this is a safe solution or not but it does seem to be
16:30:47 <m2tu[m]> #### build completed successfully (02:03:46 (hh:mm:ss)) ####
16:31:01 <m2tu[m]> üôÇ
16:31:07 <motovate[m]> <manjusri[m] "in f-droid you will find Aurora "> thank you
16:33:12 <faxing[m]> Aurora is safe but I'd stick to F-Droid if you can
16:33:26 <somenerd[m]> again very offtopic
16:33:30 <faxing[m]> Just because you download an app anonymously doesn't mean that it doesn't contain tracking code from big tech companies. Also Graphene (and Android in general) has worse privacy from apps, remember
16:33:40 <somenerd[m]> please go to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org to continue
16:34:14 <faxing[m]> <somenerd[m] "again very offtopic "> Just don't want people to have incorrect information and overconfidence on applications, I'll move to offtopic though, you're right.
16:34:20 <m2tu[m]> ill sugest people to also downlaod apkstudio  or apktool
16:34:36 <m2tu[m]> to decompile suspect apk and see their manifests and configs
16:34:43 <faxing[m]> <m2tu[m] "ill sugest people to also downla"> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
16:34:50 <faxing[m]> We all should be there lol
16:35:06 <faxing[m]> also those websites are shady as anything
16:35:36 <faxing[m]>  * also the websites for those apps look shady as anything
18:41:01 <strcat> faxing[m]: it's not sacrificing 'some security', it's sacrificing *substantial* privacy and security from losing all of the GrapheneOS hardening
18:41:15 <strcat> faxing[m]: read https://grapheneos.org/features and please don't give recommendations like that to people in the channel
18:41:47 <faxing[m]> I already apologized for recommending it
18:41:52 <faxing[m]> I'm aware of the downsides.
18:42:00 <faxing[m]>  * I'm aware of the downsides and degredations.
18:42:14 <faxing[m]>  * I'm aware of the downsides and substantial tradeoffs..
18:42:16 <faxing[m]>  * I'm aware of the downsides and substantial tradeoffs.
18:42:18 <strcat[m]> you didn't say that though
18:44:18 <faxing[m]> I already said that I wasn't recommending or promoting it in any way, that it was only to be used if you're fine sacrificing your security, that I was unaware of the situation, and that I worded the original comment poorly.
18:44:25 <faxing[m]> I mean I'm really not sure what else I can say
18:45:37 <strcat[m]> you said sacrificing 'some security'
18:45:41 <strcat[m]> when it's substantial security and privacy
18:45:52 <strcat[m]> and what you were doing is pushing one of the talking points that people use to spread misinformation and promote it
18:46:00 <faxing[m]> <faxing[m] "I said if you're fine with sacri">
18:46:07 <faxing[m]> I very clearly followed up
18:46:29 <strcat[m]> substantial security and privacy
18:46:36 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
18:46:56 <faxing[m]> Then I said "No all good (I was responding to someone else), I worded it poorly"
18:49:28 <faxing[m]> I even said later "Yeah sorry, trying to multitask and it's not working out well lol"
18:51:07 <faxing[m]> It was just an oversight, once again I apologize, I wasn't trying to fuck over the project or anything like that or cause an argument - I was just trying to help somebody out who was clearly having a really rough time with the lack of app compatibility and Calyx happened to be one of my two recommendations.
18:51:16 <faxing[m]> Have a nice rest of your day
19:16:17 <m2tu[m]> I have tryed to uplaod spyware apk intentionally and accepted everything .
19:16:50 <m2tu[m]> all i could do was see my installed apps and pictures loaded on phne..
19:17:40 <m2tu[m]> not keylogg, no webdata, no remote foto taking, no microphone...  do you know if this is graphene security enforcment or adnroid 11  it self?
19:18:48 <strcat> you said you granted it access to everything
19:18:58 <strcat> if you grant an app access to something, then it has access to that, you chose to grant it
19:19:12 <strcat> so... if you grant it access to a file, or a directory, it has access to those
19:19:21 <strcat> if you grant it access to the camera, it has access to that in the foreground
19:19:48 <strcat> sensors, camera, microphone access can only be granted for access in the foreground
19:20:11 <strcat> there isn't a way for apps to request to use it in the background, they have to run a foreground service that's visible to you if they want to use it when not being directly used
19:21:24 <m2tu[m]> Yes... i did it intentionally ... but i got impressed how little i could get
19:22:21 <m2tu[m]> with antoher os installed i can put mic on, take fotos and even capture signal messages
19:23:19 <m2tu[m]> im very happy with graphene seems to be very harden
19:25:49 <ry`an> does anyone here happen to know good suppliers for wholesale pixel phones?
19:26:03 <ry`an> don't need to be brand new
19:26:18 <ry`an> ideally 4xl
19:27:45 <strcat[m]> m2tu: I mean, if you grant access to stuff on GrapheneOS, it does work
19:27:57 <strcat[m]> m2tu:  if you go into Settings and grant something access to notifications management, it can do that
19:28:05 <strcat[m]> we don't stop you doing the same things as AOSP
19:28:11 <strcat[m]> it's your choice to do that
19:28:24 <strcat[m]> the Settings permission manager makes it easy to browse through that stuff to review it
19:34:47 <m2tu[m]> Yes i got you... but what i mean is even i granted acess, to gps, mic, camera and device admin... the spy soft could not get acess to mic and loc, just see installed fotos and which apps i had installed...
19:35:32 <strcat[m]> m2tu: it can access the stuff you granted it access to
19:35:32 <m2tu[m]> i see this  is very secure os
19:35:44 <strcat[m]> it's just not possible to access it in the foreground because you can't grant access to that
19:35:50 <strcat[m]> this has nothing to do with OS security
19:35:55 <strcat[m]> you granted it access to those things
19:35:58 <strcat[m]> so it has access to those things
19:37:05 <strcat[m]> you're misinterpreting what's happening
19:37:18 <strcat[m]> there is no magic to know when an app is malicious or not and that fundamentally cannot be implemented
19:37:32 <strcat[m]> and anyway you specifically wanted to do this
19:37:44 <strcat[m]> so it would be incorrect to call it malicious
19:38:00 <strcat[m]> you explicitly wanted to install an app for monitoring those things and allowed it
19:38:06 <strcat[m]> and it was allowed, because you allowed it
19:38:32 <strcat[m]> sounds like the app wasn't updated to use a foreground service as required since Android 9 / 10
19:38:38 <strcat[m]> to access those things when access has been granted
19:39:11 <m2tu[m]> now im trying to make iptables to put direct in build forbidd all incommig trafic... but not that will help
19:39:47 <m2tu[m]> think i must also deny out and just let what i know i will use.
19:40:14 <strcat[m]> the OS already has a firewall and already filters traffic
19:40:25 <strcat[m]> apps without INTERNET don't have direct or indirect access to the network
19:40:38 <strcat[m]> it's not possible to do fine-grained filtering in a correct way
19:40:43 <strcat[m]>  * it's not possible to do finer-grained filtering in a correct way
19:41:10 <strcat[m]> m2tu: https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356400290640125952
19:41:17 <strcat[m]> suggest reading this thread (the thread, not the 1 tweet alone)
19:42:14 <m2tu[m]> ouchh
21:14:17 <ryan[m]4> Is it recommended to use the vanilla android messaging app?
21:15:19 <strcat> ryan[m]4: it's recommended to avoid carrier-based calls and texts whenever possible
21:15:37 <strcat> ryan[m]4: using the standard messaging app for carrier-based texts makes sense but you should avoid carrier-based texts
21:15:45 <strcat> you shouldn't be using them enough that you want a fancier app
21:15:55 <strcat> get your contacts to install Signal
21:17:12 <tidria[m]> there was a scrolling bug with signal that was making it a hard sell for groups but I believe they fixed it in the update a few days ago
21:17:59 <ryan[m]4> I'm using smsMatrix to route my messages through to element and i generally avoid carrier texts, i just wanted to be able to disable notifications for my Messages app but its not letting me
21:18:15 <mr_hebi_san[m]> If only it were easier.  Most recent objection I hit from a friend is "but if I use apps like those then I just look suspicious and if they weren't looking at me they definitely will start"
21:18:16 <ryan[m]4>  * @strcat I'm using smsMatrix to route my messages through to element and i generally avoid carrier texts, i just wanted to be able to disable notifications for my Messages app but its not letting me
21:18:31 <ryan[m]4>  *  I'm using smsMatrix to route my messages through to element and i generally avoid carrier texts, i just wanted to be able to disable notifications for my Messages app but its not letting me
21:18:41 <strcat> ryan[m]4: there are standard notification settings
21:19:16 <strcat> open the messaging app and open up settings
21:19:17 <strcat> there's a toggle
21:19:50 <strcat[m]> the way those work is special
21:20:12 <ryan[m]4> @strcat:matrix.org: it's greyed out
21:20:29 <ryan[m]4> Can I post images in here?
21:20:35 <strcat[m]> ryan: open the messaging app
21:20:37 <strcat[m]> go to settings
21:20:50 <strcat[m]> you're looking at the OS notification settings
21:21:11 <ryan[m]4> Duh thanks. Was going through the app settings
21:21:26 <strcat[m]> the way these notifications work is special
21:21:27 <strcat[m]> for SMS
21:35:22 <thetranstocommie> hey so, when I turn on "enable grid options" in the stock launcher, how do I actually change that grid
22:16:35 <ztychr> thetranstocommie: asked that earlier today - might have been missed. not sure if it's supported
22:17:11 <grabba[m]> <ryan[m]4 "I'm using smsMatrix to route my "> Do you text carrier numbers with that?
22:22:35 <ryan[m]4> yep
22:23:14 <ryan[m]4> grabba: yes it works as a 2 way proxy if you will.
22:23:59 <ryan[m]4> grabba: the app routes messages from and to my element app, and also sets the name of the username in element based off what i have in my contacts
22:24:33 <ryan[m]4> i love it
22:24:51 <ryan[m]4> i love it as i'm able to text from any platform i want
22:25:15 <wrt[m]> ryan:how did you install the bridge?
22:26:28 <ryan[m]4> the bridge runs in the smsMatrix application, you create a user account in matrix for the bot, and after that it works pretty seamlessly for me.
22:31:01 <wrt[m]> <ryan[m]4 "the bridge runs in the smsMatrix"> plse could you share a link to the app
22:31:15 * ryan[m]4 uploaded an image: Capture.PNG (41KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.hagen.tech/CpgrgpcLwUPhFxueOnQPhstF/Capture.PNG >
22:31:26 <ryan[m]4> https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix
22:31:53 <wrt[m]> cheers
22:33:22 <ryan[m]4> beware if you dont have your own matrix homeserver. I don't know how secure this would be if you're going to use a public homesever.
22:33:47 <wrt[m]> noted
22:42:55 <wrt[m]> so presumably if one had an old droid, one could keep the main sim at home running the bridge (is there similar for voice calls?), then use a data only sim for your Pixel.
22:43:08 <ryan[m]4> yep
22:43:42 <wrt[m]> pretty good solution for overseas travel
22:43:54 <ryan[m]4> only caveat is you'd need to run your own matrix homeserver, as E2E is not supported
22:44:14 <wrt[m]> ahhh the room can't be encrypted?
22:44:23 <duck[m]> last commit was 14 months ago
22:45:57 <ryan[m]4> <wrt[m] "ahhh the room can't be encrypted"> nope
22:46:14 <wrt[m]> beyond https...
22:46:36 <ryan[m]4> it is open source though, yes your data-in-transit is https
22:47:20 <ryan[m]4> you could get a dedicated hosted homeserver from element its looking pretty cheap https://element.io/plans-and-pricing/pro
22:47:22 <wrt[m]> https://gitlab.com/nova/mautrix-amp
22:47:32 <ryan[m]4> or build your own in aws or something
22:47:33 <ryan[m]4> or host at your home
22:49:29 <wrt[m]> already with the ems.host you linked to...
22:49:56 <ryan[m]4> you're good then, if you trust ems with your texts
22:51:21 <wrt[m]> cheers!   fwiw - just seen that beeperhq have shared all their bridges https://gitlab.com/nova
22:51:35 <duck[m]> use signal
22:52:00 <wrt[m]> as default sms client?
22:52:32 <duck[m]> sms is insecure
22:52:40 <wrt[m]> ...
22:53:00 <wrt[m]> it's not a channel of choice.
22:54:03 <ryan[m]4> signal doesn't route your sms messages, so if you want to respond to an sms, you need your phone
22:54:48 <ryan[m]4>  * signal doesn't route your sms messages, so if you want to respond/read an sms, you need your phone
22:55:29 <ryan[m]4> i tried getting my mom to swtich to signal, that was a disaster
22:56:06 <wrt[m]> HA! same
23:12:52 <m2tu[m]> why does the build not reconize when i edit something on Android.mk file ?
23:13:05 <m2tu[m]> once it did but second edit not
23:14:51 <newbiegraphie> Its been about a year since I put grapheneos on my phone.¬† I did it today using the web installer.... really smooth experience.¬† Nice work to those involved
