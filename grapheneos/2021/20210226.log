00:03:29 <skwisgaar[m]> marsgoals: there’s been some really thorough discussion about this in the past from JollyRoger and others. I’d try to explain it but you’d learn more from searching and reading past messages
00:04:51 <marsgoals[m]> Thank you! I'm new on this platform and it's a bit confusing for me. How do I get to those discussions?

00:07:16 <skwisgaar[m]> And yeah, the grapheneos website has documentation too
00:08:30 <jj1013> Would talking about the flashing tools be off-topic in here? Does the adb package from the Debian repos have telemetry or something?
00:08:57 <marsgoals[m]> I'm not even sure what I'm in. Here's the URL I'm in: https://riot.im/app/#/room/#grapheneos:matrix.org - what am I in? Sorry but really new on this matrix type stuff
00:09:15 <sphinx[m]> <jj1013 "Would talking about the flashing"> adb isn't used in the installation process.
00:10:41 <sphinx[m]> <marsgoals[m] "I'm not even sure what I'm in. H"> You are in a Matrix room which is bridged from the IRC channel.

01:14:17 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like!
01:14:35 <jess> oh ti's the same person
01:14:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
01:14:39 <jess> it's*

01:47:16 * megan-riley[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/xkxYsunrXkpQpYGHOEmsaBac/message.txt >
01:50:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hello megan-riley[m],
01:51:01 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to see you, your earlier posts actually were klined because they tripped our spam detection system - Matrix hosts long messages itself.
01:51:05 <megan-riley[m]> Hello TheJollyRoger!
01:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: give me a moment, and I can help you out.
01:51:35 <rny> megan-riley[m]: please use the web installer
01:51:38 <isavotoast[m]> Any of you guys have a favorite Foss sms messenger for android?
01:51:39 <isavotoast[m]> and more importantly,
01:51:39 <isavotoast[m]> F Droid warns the user of anti features of apps. Does the OS do anything to inhibit these anti features such as tracking or are we undermining security, etc, by continuing to install an app?
01:51:49 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: You should install using Microsoft Edge and the web installer.
01:52:04 <TheJollyRoger> The connect button is grayed out on Firefox/Tor Browser because Firefox/Tor Browser does not support WebUSB.
01:52:10 <isavotoast[m]> Not to trample on Megan's issue
01:52:26 <TheJollyRoger> isavotoast[m]: You'll probably find more help with apps at #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
01:53:00 <megan-riley[m]> Yes TheJOllyRoger. I had 2 URLs posted that got me, but they were URLs to google and graphenOS website.
01:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Please use Microsoft Edge and the Web installer. Note that using Incognito mode with the web installer will cause Edge to dump the cache before the files are fully downloaded, resulting in an error.
01:53:30 <megan-riley[m]> TheJolly Roger, I am using MS Edge.
01:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Whatever you do, please *do not* follow third party guides or installation videos, unless you want a $700 paperweight.
01:54:35 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, yes I know that too, but thanks anyway.
01:54:37 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: When you have the phone plugged in, is it on fastboot?
01:54:44 <megan-riley[m]> yes
01:55:23 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: while your phone is on Fastboot, can you open up Device Manager for me and see if the driver for the Android Bootloader Interface is enumerated?
01:56:13 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: also, something to note, just because you can unlock the bootloader with that cable, that doesn't necessarily mean the cable's good; plenty of cables and motherboards will allow you to do this but don't have all the necessary firmware support/traces for Fastboot to do its good work.
01:56:26 <megan-riley[m]> isavatoast, thanks, but I didn't think I'd receive help because it's an "off topice" graphene website.
01:57:47 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Alright, if you followed the official guide, I can tell you how to complete the CLI install, with a few conditions:
01:57:59 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, "LeMobile - Other hardware - Android Bootloader Interface" is in Device Manager.
01:58:03 <TheJollyRoger> The first one being, I'm flying blind, so if you try to take liberties with the instructions, I won't know what you're doing.
01:58:21 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: alright, good. Does it have a yellow triangle with a ! in it?
01:58:42 <TheJollyRoger> When you click properties, what does the driver say, up to date and functioning properly?
01:58:52 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, I will follow instructions to the very letter.
01:59:10 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. I want you to return to PowerShell where you were before
01:59:51 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know when you're ready.
02:01:53 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know when you're waiting at Powershell...
02:02:13 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, I don't see "LeMobile - Other hardware - Android Bootloader Interface" in Device Mgr, but I did download it as an OPTIONAL update, and the update was successfully applied. Would LeMobile be under some drill-down place in Device Mgr?
02:03:03 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec, let me fetch a device and I'll go through it with you.
02:03:12 <megan-riley[m]> k
02:03:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, do you see Android Bootloader Interface? Right Click on it and click Properties.
02:03:42 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know if it says "This device is working properly."
02:03:47 <TheJollyRoger> We will find out more later.
02:04:24 <isavotoast[m]> <TheJollyRoger "isavotoast: You'll probably find"> fail to join
02:04:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec isavotoast[m]
02:04:42 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, I don't see "LeMobile - Other hardware - Android Bootloader Interface" in Device Mgr, but I did download it as an OPTIONAL update, and the update was successfully applied. Would LeMobile be under some drill-down place in Device Mgr
02:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> isavotoast[m]: I sent you an invite.
02:05:13 <isavotoast[m]> ty
02:05:34 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: It should be under the root.
02:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> Under your host.
02:06:08 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure the phone is plugged in and on the screen that says "Fastboot Mode <!>"
02:06:47 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, I don't see "LeMobile..." in DevMgr, but I did download "LeMobile - Other hardware - Android Bootloader Interface"  via Windows OPTIONAL updates.
02:07:02 <megan-riley[m]> OK, let me plug the phone in
02:08:13 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Yeah, you'll only see this -- and get that update for it -- if you have it plugged in.
02:08:34 <TheJollyRoger> To get to fastboot, I want you to hold down the volume down key, keep it held down, and then press down and hold the power key. Fastboot should start.
02:09:49 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, yes. I now see LeMobile when I plugged my phone in.
02:10:11 <megan-riley[m]> I'm at fastboot/bootloader menu now
02:11:10 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Now... before we go about this the hard way,
02:11:16 <TheJollyRoger> let's go about this and try the easy way first.
02:11:24 <megan-riley[m]> k
02:11:45 <TheJollyRoger> You've unlocked the bootloader?
02:12:19 <TheJollyRoger> You also see in Device Manager "Andorid Bootloader Interface" under "Properties" it says "This device is working properly?"
02:12:59 <megan-riley[m]> Yes
02:13:13 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
02:14:16 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, head to https://grapheneos.org/install/web#obtaining-factory-images and start with Obtaining Factory Images while the phone is plugged in and on fastboot.
02:14:39 <TheJollyRoger> Let's see if this works first, before we try the cli way.
02:15:14 <TheJollyRoger> To prevent you from flashing the wrong device with the wrong image, the installer has a fail-safe that detects which device is which.
02:15:48 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't have the phone plugged in and on fastboot while the installer is going, the installer won't let you go further.
02:16:19 <megan-riley[m]> I've previously downloaded "sunfish-factory-2021.02.07.17.zip"
02:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: let's just try this the easy way first, alright? Can you see if the web install works now?
02:17:40 <megan-riley[m]> Let me try, but the "connect" button was grayed-out previously. Gimme a sec please.
02:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> If this doesn't work, then we'll do this the CLI way, but not if an easier way presents itself first.
02:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, because your phone needs to be switched on, connected, and on fastboot for it to detect.
02:18:18 <TheJollyRoger> You must then select the device from the list it presents.
02:20:33 <SRC> Switched to Microsoft Edge, now when I click download release on the web installer it says Error: The specified endpoint is not part of a claimed and selected alternate interface.
02:20:46 <SRC> ?
02:21:06 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: odd, stick around, someone more expert than I will have to sort you out.
02:21:15 <SRC> Thanks
02:21:44 <megan-riley[m]> When I click on the "download release" button, the "connect" button is grayed-out and then the folllowing appears: "Error: No device selected."
02:21:58 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Ok, we'll do this the hard way then.
02:22:05 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: return to Powershell.
02:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> we're going to run a couple quick sanity checks first, and then I'll walk you through the process.
02:22:38 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: let me know when you're waiting with Powershell open.
02:22:49 <megan-riley[m]> K. I done it the CLI way, previously, when I installed Graphene on my Pixel 3a XL, but it's now broken.
02:23:06 <megan-riley[m]> PowerShell is open
02:24:37 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: alright, sanity check one:
02:24:51 <TheJollyRoger> Get-Childitem $HOME/platform-tools/fastboot.exe
02:24:59 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know if that returns "fastboot.exe"
02:26:59 <megan-riley[m]> I'm at: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Pixel_4a> but when I copied and pasted what you posted, above, I get another error.
02:28:00 <redbeard72> If I run auditor on my stock android device against my new graphene device, will the stock android device see the IMEI of the graphene device?
02:28:09 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Please don't use the administrator account on your Windows 10 installation.
02:28:29 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: no. Apps cannot access nonresettable hardware identifiers.
02:29:03 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: That's OK, this is a sanity check.
02:29:10 <redbeard72> Ok, are there any other privacy concerns, or none what so ever?
02:29:36 <TheJollyRoger> None at all.
02:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: the other phone will be able to tell if you're running GrapheneOS and if the device has or hasn't been compromised or modified, whether you have USB debugging enabled, or third-party device administrators provisioned, but even on the stock OS, that stays on that phone.
02:31:05 <redbeard72> ok, what is does "pairing" mean in the auditor context?
02:32:12 <megan-riley[m]> My path must not be right. After I "cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Pixel_4a\platform-tools_r29.0.6-windows> then ran "Get-Childitem $HOME/platform-tools/fastboot.exe" got another error.
02:32:57 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: it's because you've downloaded to a different area. It'd be easier if we just started over fresh.
02:33:02 * megan-riley[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/SMctIwwSiTJEaBTtDqLXTjUA/message.txt >
02:33:29 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: yes, it'd be easier if we just started over at the top of the CLI install fresh.
02:33:33 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, that sounds good to me!
02:33:54 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: That said, I STRONGLY suggest you do not use the hidden admin account on your computer.
02:34:10 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know why you enabled it and are using it interactively.
02:34:30 <TheJollyRoger> Since when you're doing so, virtually all security features of the operating system are essentially disabled and everything runs with full root privilege.
02:34:47 <redbeard72> Ok so I just did it. in the "verified device information" section at the bottom it shows "device identity" referring to my graphene phone, and gives a long alpha numeric string. What's the device identity mean in this context?
02:34:55 <megan-riley[m]> For some strange reason, Windows won't let me create another local account.
02:35:14 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: I will get back to you later on this, sorry.
02:35:23 <megan-riley[m]> It's the serial number I think?
02:35:29 <TheJollyRoger> No, it's not.
02:35:39 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment.
02:35:42 <redbeard72> ok, TheJollyRoger, I'll wait
02:36:35 <megan-riley[m]> let me run that command
02:36:54 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/blob/17/app/src/main/java/app/attestation/auditor/AttestationProtocol.java#L119-L192
02:37:00 <megan-riley[m]> still errors out.  I'm sorry.
02:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: nonono, don't be sorry, just sit tight, trying to wrap up some loose ends here.
02:37:33 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, there we go.
02:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Alright, I'm going to walk you through the CLI process:
02:37:56 <megan-riley[m]> k, thank you so much for your patience with me!
02:38:04 <megan-riley[m]> k
02:38:23 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so, you're on Sunfish, correct?
02:38:27 <redbeard72> yes
02:38:39 <megan-riley[m]> yes TheJolly Roger
02:38:55 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Step one: we're going to alias curl.exe to curl.
02:39:09 <TheJollyRoger> In Powershell, I want you to enter:
02:39:12 <TheJollyRoger> Remove-Item Alias:Curl
02:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> And hit return. This command produces no output.
02:39:28 <megan-riley[m]> I have sunfish in a zip file and I have it unzipped too
02:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> Let me know when it's waiting for another. If you want to check that it worked
02:39:41 <TheJollyRoger> Doesn't matter, we're starting again.
02:40:06 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to check that it worked, I want you to run
02:40:08 <TheJollyRoger> curl --version
02:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> and hit return.
02:40:14 <megan-riley[m]> alias curl executed
02:40:34 <TheJollyRoger> It should say something like "curl 7.55.1"
02:40:51 <TheJollyRoger> Confirm you've got this?
02:41:26 <TheJollyRoger> (It's just faster for me to walk you through the process rather than salvage a botched install.)
02:42:04 * megan-riley[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/psecwZSEmLlcIUgVRTqdNzME/message.txt >
02:42:30 <megan-riley[m]> EXACTLY TheJollyRoger
02:42:38 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: I think you need to reinstall Windows.
02:42:49 <TheJollyRoger> Your system pathing is messed up.
02:43:11 <TheJollyRoger> Likely you've done something in the Admin account that's caused damage to powershell or something like that.
02:43:20 <megan-riley[m]> I think the pathing is something I done and is my fault
02:43:39 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Yeah, back up everything you've got onto a separate drive and reinstall Windows. I have no clue what you've done to your system.
02:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> If it won't let you create another account, if it won't let you use powershell...
02:44:20 <TheJollyRoger> honestly much faster just to reinstall Windows than try to fix it.
02:44:47 <megan-riley[m]> But the curl command you told me  to do worked
02:44:49 <megan-riley[m]> ?
02:45:07 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: that's a built-in for the shell.
02:45:51 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: I'm sorry, but I have no clue what you have done to your computer, and I don't want to mess things up with it further.
02:46:13 <rny> already told you to use the web installer
02:46:36 <TheJollyRoger> rny: think we've found out why it won't, the OS itself is likely busted.
02:46:40 <rny> 🤦🏽
02:46:44 <TheJollyRoger> *why it won't work
02:47:48 <zzxx123> use a live usb
02:47:49 <rny> thats why the web installer works, a busted OS that can still receive driver updates can still install grapheneos just fine
02:48:14 <rny> and we dont have to spend all this effort on mental gymnastics
02:48:40 <megan-riley[m]> my (@freenode_my:matrix.org) I used the web installer to no avail, but I will rebuild Windows 10 as you said TheJollyRoger.
02:49:19 <rny> megan-riley[m]: what was the issue on web installer?
02:49:38 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: Good luck. After that, please try the web installer again first.
02:49:51 <zzxx123> probably faster to use Live Manjaro or Ubuntu
02:49:54 <megan-riley[m]> As you and both TheJollyRoger said.
02:50:30 <SRC> Can I use the web installer to flash an image I have saved on my hard drive, or does it have to be downloaded through the web installer?
02:50:32 <redbeard72> TheJollyRoger: so, I looked at the code you posted that was cool, but I still have no idea what that "indentity" string is :)
02:51:04 <megan-riley[m]> I will TheJollyRoger, and I am so sorry for taking up your time. I had no idea my Win10 is busted.
02:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: the identity string is a unique per-device value.
02:51:51 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: hey no worries. Hope you can fix it, good luck!
02:52:03 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: it's going to be different for each pairing.
02:52:19 <TheJollyRoger> So it will change depending on who's doing the auditing.
02:52:31 <redbeard72> Ah. So if I did the process the exact process over again, it would be different?
02:52:42 <TheJollyRoger> If you bought a third phone, yes.
02:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> Or if you clear pairings and start again.
02:53:07 <redbeard72> but if I audited the same phone with the same phone, the identity string is the same?
02:53:19 <TheJollyRoger> If you've paired them in the past, it will be the same.
02:53:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you clear the pairings and start over, it will change.
02:53:38 <redbeard72> Ohh, how does one "clear" a pairing?
02:53:47 <TheJollyRoger> Tap the "..." with your finger.
02:54:07 <TheJollyRoger> You will see:
02:54:10 <TheJollyRoger> "Clear Auditee Pairings"
02:54:14 <TheJollyRoger> "clear AUditor Pairings"
02:55:04 <redbeard72> Ok done. From a high level, is the identity string just a way to keep track of what pairings were done?
02:55:06 <TheJollyRoger> Those will forget devices your phone has either audited, or has been audited by.
02:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
02:55:16 <redbeard72> Interesting!
02:55:16 <TheJollyRoger> It's privacy-preserving.
02:55:34 <TheJollyRoger> The reason it's done is to allow your auditor to detect if someone attempts to change the keys surrepticiously on you.
02:55:42 <megan-riley[m]> Thanks again TheJollyRoger and my (@freenode_my:matrix.org). Before I reinstall Windows on my PC, I'm going to borrow a friends Win10 PC so I can get grapheneOS installed on my phone. Thanks all for the help, and goodbye for now.
02:55:45 <TheJollyRoger> Then the auditor can go "Hold it! something's not right!"
02:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: yes, that'd probably be for the best. Good luck, feel free to stay in the channel for help, usually someone's here often.
02:56:15 <redbeard72> would that theoretical attack during the middle of an audit?
02:56:23 <redbeard72> attack happen in*
02:57:24 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, I'm going to get my friend's laptop PC right now, so if I have any trouble with it, I'll be back in --- and thank you so much again!
02:57:25 <rny> redbeard72: what are the min limits?
02:57:46 <redbeard72> rny: I'm not sure what you mean?
02:57:53 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: good luck!
02:58:21 <rny> if i asked myself "would the earth theoretically explode the next minute", i'd have to answer yes, but its a very remote possibility.
02:58:21 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: Well, let's say that someone steal's your device vendor's keys.
02:58:35 <TheJollyRoger> And tries to write a counterfeit certificate chain for your device.
02:58:47 <megan-riley[m]> TheJollyRoger, I'm going to idle in here for right now while I go get the PC and try installing using the WebUSB installer when I get back.
02:59:02 <rny> redbeard72: so the question put to you now is, what's the ballpark risk you're willing to accept?
02:59:15 <TheJollyRoger> megan-riley[m]: you're more than welcome to stay! About a thousand people here remain signed in around the clock, you're more than welcome to do so yourself :)
02:59:37 <redbeard72> rny: just trying to understand the auditor process right now, not worried about anything.
03:00:43 <redbeard72> Changing gears: Now I've got a graphene verified system, how do I put f-droid on it?
03:01:01 <rny> redbeard72: please ask in #grapheneos-offtopic
03:01:34 <rny> redbeard72: i wouldnt worry about an attack in the middle of an audit.
03:02:24 <rny> especially if you use https://attestation.app/ as the auditee
03:02:34 <redbeard72> I used the playstore one
03:02:59 <rny> redbeard72: please read https://attestation.app/tutorial
03:03:13 <rny> s/auditee/auditor/
03:06:05 <TheJollyRoger> redbeard72: the playstore version of Auditor is the safest version to install, unless you have some kind of preauthenticated and end-to-end secured back-channel directly to Daniel Micay.
03:06:24 <take_a_deep_brea> lol
03:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> Or you're using a phone that has a verified installation of GrapheneOS already.
03:07:09 <TheJollyRoger> In which case it's bundled as a system application.
03:08:06 <SRC> Does the web installer download the graphene image to your computer and them upload it from there? Can't seem to get an answer on if I can manually download the image myself and then use the web install to flash it.
03:08:16 <SRC> I can't get the web installer to download it
03:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> SRC - it will hold it somewhere in your browser's cache. However, I'm not actually well versed in the web installer's workings under the hood.
03:10:56 <take_a_deep_brea> the web installer i think does download the image locally . as i dont think the image can be directly be sent as a stream of data to be written to your pixel's ssd . but i don't think that image is available for the user to locate and use it independently .
03:11:09 <take_a_deep_brea> that would be counter to the whole point of WebUSB
03:11:21 <take_a_deep_brea> it should just work without any user intervention
03:26:13 <bbhead[m]> I just used webUSB-based installer. Worked great.such easier than the directions on the site I used about a month ago for first phone.  When I followed directions for first phone I did find my computer needed to update some drivers to work. Not sure if that may be an issue.
03:27:43 <TheJollyRoger> bbhead[m]: Glad to hear it worked well, yeah, generally that's the biggest problem with most Windows installations, although here it looked like some system files or settings had been damaged.
03:28:18 <bbhead[m]> Ah okay. Just thought I would mention
03:30:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! It's legit, usually drivers tend to be the issue on Windows.
03:41:16 <redbeard72> whenever I try to drop the settings widget on the home screen it doesn't stick, but rather opens up a "setting shortcut" menu. Any tips?
03:42:09 <redbeard72> I just discovered that's prompting what type of setting shortcut I want to create. strange.
04:25:39 <SRC> when I run fastboot --version it outputs fastboot version 1:8.1.0+r23-5 and says this is the newest version, but when I try to flash the install it says it's too old?
04:25:54 <SRC> Debian Linux
04:28:36 <TheLoneWanderer[> Do not use the system flashboot
04:29:04 <TheLoneWanderer[> Follow the CLI instructions or use the webinstaller
04:29:19 <TheLoneWanderer[> The webinstaller is the recommended method
04:30:18 <SRC> Webinstaller won't download the image so I have to use CL
04:30:44 <somenerd[m]> The web install is recommended for people who don't want to verify the signature and are new to cli
04:30:53 <TheLoneWanderer[> It automagically performs all the steps in the background
04:31:49 <take_a_deep_brea> ummm , SRC:   its alright to follow the CLI guide but you need to _follow_ it . like if you'd followed instructions for Debian you would have downloaded platform tools from android developer webiste'
04:32:04 <take_a_deep_brea> then you wouldnt face the version problem
04:33:38 <take_a_deep_brea> the flash-all script checks wether the version of fastboot available is a valid one or not . if the script is saying its an olld version , then it is an old version . and why wouldn't it be because we are talking of debian here (no offense)
04:34:26 <SRC> I followed the instructions and ran these commands
04:34:30 <SRC> sudo apt install libarchive-tools
04:34:30 <SRC> curl -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
04:34:31 <SRC> echo 'd6d72d006c03bd55d49b6cef9f00295db02f0a31da10e121427e1f4cb43e7cb9  platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip' | sha256sum -c
04:34:31 <SRC> bsdtar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
04:34:45 <take_a_deep_brea> ok that sounds good
04:34:52 <SRC> So I'm not sure why it's still out of date??
04:35:04 <TheLoneWanderer[> Add to path
04:35:10 <take_a_deep_brea> well maybe you have installed fastboot using apt-get earlier
04:35:47 <take_a_deep_brea> ?
04:35:49 <take_a_deep_brea> and that takes precedence when the script checks for fastboot in your PATH ?
04:36:08 <SRC> Could be let me redo it
04:36:14 <take_a_deep_brea> make suure that you add /wherever/platform-tools to the beginning of your PATH v
04:36:26 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC: ^
04:36:37 <take_a_deep_brea>  * make suure that you add /wherever/platform-tools to the beginning of your PATH
04:37:38 <SRC> That's what I didn't do, I just copied this and ran it   export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
04:39:23 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont understand , you mean you did this earlier ? or you did not do this earlier ?
04:40:00 <take_a_deep_brea> cause that's what i meant by adding platfom-tools to the beginning of the PATH
04:40:44 <SRC> I just copied that command and didn't add the actual path into it?
04:41:01 <take_a_deep_brea> ok understood
04:41:25 <rny> did you update to latest stock before you did our steps?
04:41:28 <take_a_deep_brea> so make sure now that you actually specify the full path to the platform-tools directory
04:41:32 <rny> bootloader needs to be updated first
04:41:45 <rny> otherwise, its common to get fastboot old version
04:41:50 <SRC> Is this how it's supposed to look?  export PATH="$PWD/home/pureos/platform-tools:$PATH"
04:42:47 <take_a_deep_brea> nah . just use the out put of `$ pwd`
04:43:02 <take_a_deep_brea> after entering platform-tools directory
04:43:36 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  also just check wether you have updated the stock OS as rny  pointed out
04:45:59 <SRC> Sorry but I don't understand what exactly to enter for the path, the instructions are not clear to me
04:47:00 <rny> SRC: if you do not understand, then you should use the web-installer.
04:47:08 <rny> the CLI method is for people familiar with using CLI.
04:47:27 <SRC> everything else is clear besides the path instructions
04:47:30 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  what do you want to achieve by using CLI ?
04:47:54 <take_a_deep_brea> OK , where did you extract the platform-tools?
04:48:06 <take_a_deep_brea> Home?
04:48:42 <rny> you are not meant to copy-paste $PWD verbatim, $PWD is where you placed the platform-tools directory.
04:48:57 <SRC> I've tried using the web installer multiple times, I got the bootloader unlocked and then every time I try to download the image it says Error: The specified endpoint is not part of a claimed and selected alternate interface.
04:49:42 <rny> are you using chromium?
04:50:13 <SRC> I've tried Chromium and am now on Microsoft Edge and it gives me that error on both
04:51:47 <SRC> I did not update the stock OS if that might have something to do with it, it is still on 9 I think
04:52:16 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  aaah , that might be _the_ problem as 9 is veeeeerryyy old
04:52:18 <take_a_deep_brea> now
04:52:29 <take_a_deep_brea> and you should update it
04:52:39 <take_a_deep_brea> right away
04:52:47 <SRC> Yeah I bought a new sealed Pixel 3, I'll try updating it hopefully that works
04:52:50 <rny> zzz
04:53:00 <take_a_deep_brea> sweeet dreamz
04:53:04 <rny> instruction says to update stock to latest then apply our methods
04:53:05 <rny> zzz
04:53:25 <SRC> oops so sorry
04:53:48 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  the deal with the cli instructions is I have to read it carefully and ensure I have taken each step
04:53:49 <rny> ok let us know how you go tomorrow
04:54:02 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  update the device
04:54:08 <take_a_deep_brea> it will take some time
04:54:39 <take_a_deep_brea> then try doing the web installer /cli whichever and if you face any isssues ask here
04:54:52 <take_a_deep_brea> preferably the web installer
04:54:56 <rny> SRC: re: the path issue, what you have done looks right
04:55:06 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
04:55:06 <rny> its common to get fastboot version too old if your bootloader is outdated
04:56:41 <SRC> To be fair the instructions say it's best practice to update, not that it has to be done. I so distrust google I wanted to skip that step entirely and go straight to graphene lol. Hopefully that's the issue
04:56:56 <TheLoneWanderer[> Isn't the fastboot too old caused by the script in this context?
04:57:18 <rny> TheLoneWanderer[: no
04:57:46 <take_a_deep_brea> well it would be nice if we could differentiate that
04:58:17 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  google puts a lot of work into developing AOSP . so dont be under the illusion that you are degoogling
04:58:23 <TheLoneWanderer[> Why not? They mentioned fastboot --version => debian one
04:58:27 <take_a_deep_brea> google isn't evil
04:58:45 <SRC> Right...
04:58:52 <take_a_deep_brea> it has to make money , and makes mistakes along the way
04:58:58 <take_a_deep_brea> big ones , agreed
05:04:21 <xx> Hello, I've been trying to flash grapheneOS through the web installer and always getting 1000ms timeout. tried many cables did everything and it is still giving me the timeout error. But i just flashed google rom through their web installer and it all went smooth and successful. Any ideas?
05:04:37 <xx> still after flashing google's stock rom cant reflash grapheneOS
05:04:48 <xx> Linux using google chrome browser
05:12:23 <rny> xx: were you able to troubleshoot what timeout this is?
05:13:06 <somenerd[m]> > SRC:  google puts a lot of work into developing AOSP . so dont be under the illusion that you are degoogling
05:13:06 <somenerd[m]> I mean, their services are the part that's problematic
05:13:18 <somenerd[m]> so technically, it is degoogling
05:13:25 <xx> it flashes and goes smooth until fastboot and writing system then it gives me this 1000ms time out error
05:13:51 <somenerd[m]> if "degoogling" meant removing every line of code made by google, I don't think that you'd be able to use the Internet at all
05:18:58 <rny> ^ google is part of lots of submarine cable consortiums
05:19:04 <take_a_deep_brea> why would you choose to trust them with one thing and not with the other ?
05:19:19 <take_a_deep_brea> it does not make any sense .
05:19:25 <somenerd[m]> I mean, their privacy policy is poor in terms of other things
05:19:35 <somenerd[m]> Their open source work is good though
05:19:51 <rny> anyways, pls take degoogling discussions to the offtopic channel
05:20:17 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, I'll move to the offtopic channel
05:25:10 <SRC> I was going to buy a Purism Librem 5 but I'll try the pixel + graphene first and see how that goes. Not many options for a reasonably secure smart phone
05:26:05 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  if you took at the logs you'd notice that Purism Librem is highly unrecommended
05:26:26 <take_a_deep_brea> but thats a topic for #grapheneos-offtopic
05:26:39 <somenerd[m]> It's been discussed many times
05:26:55 <take_a_deep_brea>  * SRC:  if you take a look at the logs you'd notice that Purism Librem is highly unrecommended
05:26:59 <somenerd[m]> in short, Purism doesn't really care
05:27:31 <take_a_deep_brea> SRC:  https://freenode.logbot.info/?ch=grapheneos&q=librem
05:28:19 <SRC> Very interested to read this, thanks
05:28:33 <take_a_deep_brea> No problem .
05:28:52 <xx> After unpacking system right at writing system it times out
05:31:36 <SRC> If the Librem phone is insecure I would imagine the Librem 15 laptop I spent $1,600 on is as well :|
05:31:57 <TheJollyRoger> SRC - it is.
05:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> Because they've disabled firmware updates because those are non free, all the peripherals on it are essentially now un-updateable and vulnerable.
05:33:41 <TheJollyRoger> Not only that but since they've disabled the management engine on your CPU, we don't know if the CPU is getting proper exploit mitigations for hardware-level bugs and vulnerabilities.
05:33:59 <rny> offtopic pls
05:34:05 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry sir.
05:38:05 <SRC> @TheJollyRoger Where can I ask you some questions about Librem alternatives, specifically for laptops?
05:38:30 <TheJollyRoger> I've invited you to the right room.
05:38:34 <TheJollyRoger> I'll see you there.
05:39:58 <TheJollyRoger> SRC: head to #grapheneos-offtopic and I can discuss with you a little but I must head off for the night soon.

11:34:35 <Citizen528[m]> Are there are any other OS's like this regarding security, that supports older devices? My impression is that grapheneos only uses phones that are a few years old at most. I've got a pixel 1 that works fine, but I'd like to harden it's security. It's currently running lineageos so that's not great
11:45:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> I think it won't even boot the current GrapheneOS version

14:41:32 <bobfett-notusedo> I am on the latest beta on pixel 3 xl and I am not able to take pictures with open camera anymore. The workaround seems needed still
14:42:19 <bobfett-notusedo> Or should I change something in the settings?
14:42:46 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <bobfett-notusedo "I am on the latest beta on pixel"> Ah, welp. Even on stock camera?
14:42:53 <DFuchsiaOS_when> The AOSP one, rather

14:44:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> And even told users to sideload it
14:44:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat also made announcements
14:45:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Same goes for jollyroger
14:45:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Think a couple other people from this community also helped
14:45:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> And now we hear of bugs again when it's in stable
14:47:51 <emrysmerlin[m]> I use lineage OS as a roadmap code for my device to get Graphene  on there but when I relock the boatloader it goes into boot loop.....any thoughts?

14:49:58 <bobfett-notusedo> Oh'.... It is stable now?... Matrix got broken on me 😥
14:50:17 <emrysmerlin[m]> Well maybe someone else try grapheme on other devices and can help? You never know....sometimes some people surprise you with their knowledge

14:53:21 <emrysmerlin[m]> OK thanks for the link
14:59:57 <bobfett-notusedo> First: sorry if I have a life and am not able to test your product... If you want to know I am moving from a flat to another and don't have time to test stuff...
14:59:57 <bobfett-notusedo> Secondly sorry if I report a bug... I am willing to have bug (since I use beta channel) and let the developers know... I think you overreact a bit...
14:59:57 <bobfett-notusedo> Third: I rebooted and opencamera does not work but aosp works. Thanks for the tip
15:00:02 <zzxx123> Can't see strcat's msg somehow
15:00:20 <zzxx123> other Matrix people are fine
15:00:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> bobfett - 🐈️ (backup account): ok
15:00:54 <bobfett-notusedo> On opencamera : everything is fine, except that when I take a picture the camera preview seems to freeze and the camera error with a serious error
15:01:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the only problem is with open camera
15:01:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> bobfett - 🐈️ (backup account): what error
15:01:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> "a serious error" doesn't tell me what's wrong
15:03:44 <bobfett-notusedo> <anupritaisno1[m] ""a serious error" doesn't tell m"> Sorry, I cannot have log at the moment.... Moving and I do not have a computer for that...
15:04:09 <bobfett-notusedo> It just says serious camera error on screen and that's all
15:05:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> <bobfett-notusedo "It just says serious camera erro"> Screenshots
15:06:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also you can take bug reports and send those to the devs

18:02:58 <Guest989> Hello there, sorry to bother. I'm trying to install onto pixel 4a - I booted into bootloader but the web interface isn't detecting my device. Driver issue I'm sure, but it just mentions checking windows update. Is there a manual driver somewhere I can install? I'm on win10
18:03:40 <strcat[m]> Guest989: use the Windows Update approach it covers
18:03:56 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#connecting-phone
18:03:56 <Guest989> Right, did that. Nothing comes up.
18:04:01 <strcat[m]> it gives specific instructions
18:04:12 <strcat[m]> describe what you've done
18:04:28 <Guest989> I checked for windows updates, then selected view all optional updates.
18:04:41 <strcat[m]> Guest989: so what do you see there
18:04:49 <Guest989> Only one comes up, the latest 02/2021 security patch and a few random driver ones for my printer and some intel stuff.
18:05:04 <strcat[m]> no 'bootloader interface' one?
18:05:07 <Guest989> nope
18:05:08 <strcat[m]> is it in the update history?
18:05:14 <Guest989> mmm let me check update history
18:05:15 <strcat[m]> look at update history
18:05:30 <strcat[m]> for most people it actually just installs this automatically
18:05:48 <strcat[m]> Guest989: if not, it sounds like you may not have a working USB connection
18:05:54 <strcat[m]> make sure to follow the instructions about USB
18:06:07 <strcat[m]> most USB-A to USB-C cables are non-spec-compliant and don't work properly for stuff like this
18:06:10 <Guest989> Yeah I have factory USB-C cable into direct port on my laptop
18:06:21 <Guest989> nothing in update history aside from some intel and lenovo stuff (thinkpad)
18:08:20 <Guest989> I'm using my laptop as I don't have usb-c on my desktop motherboard, but I could try the usb-c > usb-a cable that came with the phone on that
18:10:11 <strcat> Guest989: the phones don't come with USB-C to USB-A cables but rather an adapter for attaching USB-A cables to it
18:10:17 <strcat> you probably don't have a USB-A to USB-A cable
18:10:37 <Guest989> oh you're right, my mistake. just looked in the box again and it is an adapter
18:11:14 <strcat> that adapter is provided primarily so that you can use USB-A peripherals or connect to another device with USB-A to the port on that device
18:11:19 <strcat> like USB-A to micro USB
18:11:45 <Guest989> Ah, yeah. Won't help me much here unless I use a regular usb-a to usb-a cable then adapter into phone which I'm sure is frowned upon
18:12:01 <Guest989> I've tried both usb-c ports on my laptop as one is standard and the other is thunderbolt
18:13:37 <strcat> Guest989: check again for the driver in Windows Update
18:13:38 <strcat> with both ports
18:13:50 <strcat> need to check for updates then look at optional
18:14:26 <Guest989> I just discovered I DO have a usb-C on the back of my desktop mobo! Can try on that machine.
18:14:36 <Guest989> it makes the windows noise that a device is connected when I plug it in
18:15:14 <strcat> sounds like laptop is just broken
18:15:24 <strcat> lots of devices for some reason have broken USB
18:15:27 <strcat> it's sad
18:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I think the problem is that even if the part vendor fully implements the traces, usually the OEM doesn't adequately test the driver for all the corner cases that USB has, only the barest minimum that most users use, like media transfer, keyboard and mouse, and storage. Certainly not device debugging.
18:17:31 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: So this is why on occasion, some perfectly good setups end up not working, for no fault of the person sitting at the chair.
18:17:44 <Guest989> That's totally fair.
18:17:50 <TheJollyRoger> *doesn't adequately test the driver and the firmware on the motherboard
18:18:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's also the same story for USB cables as well, most of them only have the wires for data transfer and power, but not device control or interfaces like fastboot.
18:19:08 <Guest989> That's so dumb and should be illegal to make/sell.
18:19:13 <Guest989> hard to enforce, but still
18:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
18:19:53 <strcat[m]> btw one way to work around broken USB hardware / cables is often flipping the USB-C cable
18:19:56 <strcat[m]> and plugging it in the other way
18:20:05 <strcat[m]> cause they cut corners
18:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> My headphones are like that.
18:20:08 <strcat[m]> and don't implement it properly
18:20:17 <Guest989> end to end or one side over?
18:20:24 <strcat[m]> (even if the cable is good, it can work around a broken port)
18:20:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, to turn one side over.
18:20:30 <Guest989> ah
18:20:44 <strcat[m]> one side
18:20:47 <strcat[m]> the side going into the sketchy port
18:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: if you ever come across a pair of the old style Google-branded headsets, they're directional, so if you plug the plug in upside-down, it might not work.
18:22:21 <TheJollyRoger> Unfortunately, the only way to detect if you've plugged it in upside down is to first try one way, then if that doesn't work, try the other. Fortunately, I think Google has stopped making them.
18:22:25 <Guest989> Just plugged into my desktop and device showed up immediately. Methinks strcat is right and my laptop is fubared. I haven't been super happy with my laptop and this adds to it lol
18:22:34 <TheJollyRoger> Oh good gravy.
18:23:57 <Guest989> to be fair it could just be a funky windows update thing on my laptop but oh well
18:25:44 <Guest989> I appreciate the help regardless, both of you :)  it's doing its thing now running through the flashing script
18:25:53 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: Woohoo!
18:26:41 <Guest989> my other backup option if that didn't work was to boot into ubuntu and trying there as i dual boot on my desktop
18:27:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That also works.
18:27:38 <TheJollyRoger> It is generally a little easier to do on Windows though.
18:27:49 <strcat[m]> Guest989: it's our experience that ~50% of USB-A to USB-C cables are broken and perhaps ~30% of non-Macbook/non-Chromebook laptops
18:28:02 <strcat[m]> when it comes to properly implemented USB capable of doing this reliably
18:28:04 <strcat[m]> which is not a big ask
18:28:15 <strcat[m]> Guest989: USB-C ecosystem is unfortunate a *disaster*
18:28:29 <strcat[m]> and these non-spec ports, cables and chargers are actively dangerous
18:28:32 <strcat[m]> they can start fires
18:28:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's not your fault, it's the vendor being lazy, cheaping out and selling a broken product.
18:28:44 <strcat[m]> devices tend to be pretty resistant to being damaged but they can definitely be damaged by them
18:28:57 <strcat[m]>  * devices like flagship phones tend to be pretty resistant to being damaged but they can definitely be damaged by them
18:29:12 <strcat[m]>  * devices like the supported phones tend to be pretty resistant to being damaged but they can definitely be damaged by them
18:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. iPhones have overvoltage/grounding protection, but unfortunately Pixel 3s don't.
18:30:22 <Guest989> hmm interesting. I got a warning in bootloader that "your device is booting a different operating system - visit this link to learn more" - how would it know if everything including the bootloader was wiped?
18:30:48 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: that's normal. That's the verified boot letting you know that it's on and enforcing, but it's enforcing to third-party keys.
18:30:54 <Guest989> Ahh
18:30:56 <Guest989> Fair enough
18:31:05 <TheJollyRoger> In which case, it's enforcing to the GrapheneOS Verified boot keys.
18:31:51 <Guest989> I can't tell you how good it feels to finally have a google-free device.
18:32:41 <TheJollyRoger> When you installed GrapheneOS, the installer gave your phone's Secure Element a set of keys that are specific to GrapheneOS, but not to Google, the phone is just letting you know that. In the future, if we can find a hardware partnership that is willing to fuse GrapheneOS' AVB root keys and treat them as vendor keys, that warning would not show, but it would require our own hardware.
18:33:38 <TheJollyRoger> So the yellow screen warning is normal and expected if you run GrapheneOS. It's only if it turns orange and displays something ominous about "Software integrity is not guaranteed! Do not use this device!" that you have to worry.
18:34:24 <TheJollyRoger> Since the orange screen warning error indicates that the bootloader has been unlocked, which disables all device security features that depend on verified boot. We can make sure that the phone's operating system disallows that by going back into Debugging Options (you'll need to enable them again), and sliding OEM unlock to "Off."
18:34:51 <TheJollyRoger> By default after a fresh installation of GrapheneOS (not after factory reset), OEM unlocking is set to on. You can change it back to off to reduce the attack surface.
18:35:38 <Guest989> Good call, I will do that.
18:35:56 <TheJollyRoger> After that, it's best practice to not disturb, and then to immediately switch Developer options back off before you start to use the phone.
18:36:06 <Guest989> After an odd "bug" in the setup screen, I rebooted and it went through setup successfully!! yahoo!!
18:36:23 <TheJollyRoger> The developer options will add a significant amount of attack surface, so they're only intended to be used for testing and development, never in production.
18:36:29 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: welcome aboard the ship, matey! :)
18:37:16 <Guest989> Hmm I actually don't have developer options menu anymore
18:37:36 <TheJollyRoger> You won't. You'll need to go back to "About Phone" and tap on "Build Number" ten times.
18:37:48 <Guest989> Ahhh okay, wasn't sure if I needed to do that. My mistake
18:38:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Just about everything from your previous installation has been lost; during a factory reset usually the secure element will turn over the file encryption keys. So any settings that you've set before, any files or stuff you had in the past, that's all gone now.
18:38:57 <TheJollyRoger> It will then generate new ones.
18:39:03 <TheJollyRoger> *generate new keys.
18:39:23 <TheJollyRoger> *during a factory reset or changing bootloader lock state
18:39:30 <Guest989> Yeah it was a fresh out of the box phone so no worries on data loss.
18:39:30 <TheJollyRoger> Argh damn it.
18:39:36 <TheJollyRoger> *during a factory reset the secure element will turn over
18:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
18:39:55 <Guest989> OEM unlocking off, rebooted, dev options off.
18:39:59 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
18:39:59 <Guest989> Sweet. Thanks so much for all your help
18:40:41 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome! You can optionally pair with attestation server at this point if you want to self-monitor your device, and if you find the software useful and want to support our work, send the developers a tip at https://grapheneos.org/donate, it keeps this ship sailing!
18:41:21 <TheJollyRoger> (Or if you have a second phone that's Android 7.0 or newer, you can do local pairing for yourself.)
18:41:53 <Guest989> Absolutely. I was just talking with a friend the other day and I was saying I wish I was a billionaire (don't we all) because I would focus philanthropic areas in FOSS software, specifically projects like this.
18:42:07 <manug[m]> Hi everyone. I plan on de-googling my Pixel 5 tomorrow to GrapheneOS! Wish me luck.
18:42:08 <manug[m]> For work I need to have Google DUO. Does that compromise the whole phone, therefore defeating the purpose?
18:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
18:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> Auditor can verify other phones running the factory OS, but only if they're on the supported device list.
18:42:33 <TheJollyRoger> manug[m]: Yarr, fair winds to ye, shipmate!
18:42:51 <Guest989> Jolly, is the attestation server the auditor thing I see?
18:43:20 <j-james[m]> manug: More secure is still better, though
18:43:23 <TheJollyRoger> manug[m]: it won't compromise the whole OS, but it may be dependent on Play Services. It may stop working if they are absent.
18:44:06 <TheJollyRoger> manug[m]: a good way to think about running apps with GrapheneOS, is that all apps on GrapheneOS are "degoogled" but if they are google dependent and their authors have not written them in such a way to function in Google's absence, you may experience weird behaviour:
18:44:19 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps may, upon being launched, display a warning, then exit.
18:44:26 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps may launch, but then fail to connect, then crash.
18:45:00 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps may function and work fine, but then fail to display notifications until you actually open the app.
18:45:03 <manug[m]> Hmm, but Google DUO must depend on play services right? Does that mean the app won't work at all on GrapheneOS?
18:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> Some apps may function and work fine, but need to run in the background and consume more battery power than normal because they're running in the background, in order to retrieve and display notifications.
18:46:01 <j-james[m]> Speaking of Google Play Services, does the nice camera app the Pixels have depend on it?
18:46:17 <TheJollyRoger> manug[m]: very high possibility it may depend on Play Services. You'll have to experiment.
18:46:26 <j-james[m]> (and are you even able to get the nice camera app since it doesn't ship with GrapheneOS)
18:46:28 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: That's part of it! Auditor is a part of attestation on GrapheneOS.
18:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: so, about Attestation...
18:47:48 <TheJollyRoger> Starting with Android 8, phones started shipping with a secure element that would hold a hardware-backed key that remains in that secure element, and the host operating system can use it, but the secure element won't let the keys leave, no matter how much the operating system running next to it begs and pleads.
18:48:24 <TheJollyRoger> So this allows those phones to remotely attest to their own operating system's authenticity using cryptography.
18:48:31 <manug[m]> <TheJollyRoger "manug: very high possibility it "> Hmm, i really want to degoogle but I need duo for my job. I risk changing to GrapheneOS and then if Google DUO doesn't work I have to go back to pixel Android, right?
18:48:45 <TheJollyRoger> manug[m]: Possibly yes. You can change back at any time you like though.
18:50:01 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: there are two ways this can be done: the first way, is via local pairing, where one phone issues a challenge to the phone being audited, and the phone being audited must respond using that key buried in its secure element. If the response is incorrect, then the phone issuing the challenge will know that something is amiss and the device is not running the operating system it claims to
18:50:02 <TheJollyRoger> be.
18:50:51 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why this is also doable is when you locked your bootloader and completed the installation that ensured that the system image on your phone is bitwise identical to every single other instance of GrapheneOS out there and will validate to the digital signature that only the GrapheneOS verified boot keys could have produced.
18:51:38 <Guest989> Interesting
18:51:41 <TheJollyRoger> The second way this can be done, is via the network, to the attestation server that GrapheneOS, as a project operates in-house.
18:52:02 <Guest989> Is this project also open source still?
18:52:07 <TheJollyRoger> It is and always will be.
18:52:09 <Guest989> sorry the attestation server
18:52:13 <Guest989> Awesome
18:52:30 <TheJollyRoger> After the first pairing, Attestation Server will ping your device via the network. If it doesn't get the correct answer, Attestation Server can warn you that something is amiss.
18:52:54 <Guest989> How often?
18:53:09 <TheJollyRoger> You choose! You can set for 4 hours minimum, or increase the amount of time.
18:53:20 <manug[m]> Thanks everyone
18:53:21 <Guest989> Ahh fair enough
18:53:24 <Guest989> https://attestation.app/tutorial
18:53:27 <TheJollyRoger> Usual case this happens: the device is switched off or not connected to the internet. But if say, you got nailed with a very nasty Android Exploit that managed to break out of its sandbox, and do something to your system partition...
18:53:35 <TheJollyRoger> This now means the system partition won't pass validation.
18:53:46 <TheJollyRoger> And the device is now no longer running a signed and verified build of GrapheneOS.
18:54:04 <Guest989> I like it, seems like a worthwhile check/balance
18:54:24 <TheJollyRoger> It is! There's more data on it, I've sort of simplified it down immensely, but there's more at https://attestation.app/about as well as a tutorial.
18:54:46 <carbonatom[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Usual case this happens: the dev"> What to do in that situation?
18:54:47 <TheJollyRoger> It's all done via QR codes. You will need an E-mail address (and you'll need to come up with a password) for it to contact you should the device fail attestation.
18:55:02 <Guest989> I very much appreciate the simplified version in addition to the documentation. Helps me understand it. And certainly appreciate your time in doing so
18:55:14 <TheJollyRoger> carbonatom[m]: If your device has been compromised to the point where your system image is now compromised, immediate factory reset.
18:55:50 <TheJollyRoger> *immediate reboot, and if the verified boot doesn't restore it to precompromise condition, immediate factory reset.
18:56:07 <TheJollyRoger> If the phone doesn't boot again, then the system image has been damaged beyond repair.
18:56:56 <carbonatom[m]> <TheJollyRoger "*immediate reboot, and if the ve"> Does "end session" button when using a user profile counts as a reboot?
18:57:00 <TheJollyRoger> Each boot will restore the system partition to a known good state - but even without the system partition compromised, it's still possible for very persistent malware to have changed settings such as adding arbitrary ADB keys, access debugging options...
18:57:19 <TheJollyRoger> carbonatom[m]: It doesn't. Rebooting is when you see that "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen.
18:57:30 <Guest989> How has the project addressed the closed source nature of the titan M chip microcode in the pixels? Is there any way to verify the integrity or ensure nothing malicious (ie google) is occurring that we don't want on that front? I'll fully admit I don't understand that deep into things, it was juts something I've seen thrown around and unsure if FUD
18:57:30 <carbonatom[m]> Got it, thanks.
18:57:30 <Guest989> or not.
18:57:31 <TheJollyRoger> The late-stage bootloader acts as a root of trust for the phone: what happens when your device first turns on,
18:57:55 <TheJollyRoger> The bootloader will check the entire image all at once to the signatures and validate it. If it doesn't validate bitwise,
18:58:13 <TheJollyRoger> then it will try to use parity blocks to try to repair or revert any damage.
18:58:15 <TheJollyRoger> If it can't,
18:58:20 <TheJollyRoger> then the phone will not boot.
18:58:34 <TheJollyRoger> Sure this means that if your phone's software is damaged beyond repair, you might not be able to use your phone.
18:58:42 <strcat[m]> Guest989: in general, hardware is closed source in any device
18:58:47 <strcat[m]> Guest989: every ARM SoC is closed source
18:58:56 <TheJollyRoger> But it's certainly more preferable your phone sacrifice itself in the line of duty, than to allow you to use a phone that could be compromised.
18:59:01 <strcat[m]> SoC is the CPU, GPU, memory controller, ISP and many other things
18:59:04 <Guest989> Ah, fair point.
18:59:11 <strcat[m]> Guest989: closed source does not make something more or less secure
18:59:14 <strcat[m]> it's orthogonal to that
18:59:14 <TheJollyRoger> carbonatom[m]: so reboot first, check settings, and if the reboot doesn't undo the damage, reset.
18:59:37 <carbonatom[m]> Thanks for clarifying. It's good to know if something happens.
18:59:54 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: So, the thing about closed source is that sooner or later, you *must* trust someone.
18:59:57 <strcat[m]> Guest989: and yes what you are bringing up is certainly FUD, spread by malicious people
19:00:10 <strcat[m]> Guest989: the Titan M is not in control of the device
19:00:28 <strcat[m]> Guest989: it's an isolated component on a separate chip with specific purposes
19:00:40 <strcat[m]> and which does not permit firmware upgrades provided by the OS until the owner user has authenticated
19:00:50 <strcat[m]> which providers 'insider attack protection'
19:01:20 <TheJollyRoger> Google is possibly the only vendor that's actually been very forthcoming of examination on their devices, and fully co-operating with open source initiatives. They even do make firmware sources available to researchers, although you have to ask for it (it's also signed). They fully open source their drivers; there are no closed-source drivers on the Pixels.
19:01:47 <Guest989> That's promising
19:02:02 <j-james[m]> TheJollyRoger: Does that include the whole networking stack?
19:02:04 <Guest989> I figured it was just straight FUD, it seemed like it.
19:02:56 <TheJollyRoger> j-james[m]: If it's the modem in the Pixels is what you're concerned about, the modem is isolated. It can only write to areas of host memory that the driver in the kernel allows it to, thanks to the Pixels' memory management.
19:03:00 <TheJollyRoger> *memory management unit.
19:03:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Unfortunately, the FSFe are...
19:03:14 <TheJollyRoger> almost religious in this matter.
19:03:49 <Guest989> FSFe?
19:04:53 <TheJollyRoger> The Free Software Foundation, they're kinda those guys that have been raising stink about "TEH BACKDURR PROSSESSER!" out of the mistaken belief that we should all go back to 1991-era devices.
19:05:10 <Guest989> Ahhh, gotcha.
19:05:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. With respect to microcode and such:
19:06:01 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: did you ban faxing?
19:06:02 <strcat[m]> was it a mistake?
19:06:04 <strcat[m]> let me see
19:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Modern hardware is complex. Incredibly so; I like to tell people that a CPU isn't really a CPU anymore, but rather a networked, interconnected, distributed system of hundreds upon thousands of CPUs that all work
19:06:11 <TheJollyRoger> faxing? No, I don't think so.
19:06:29 <TheJollyRoger> I refactored the banlist, did he pick up a VPN that--
19:06:34 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: we really need to do matrix bans on matrix
19:06:40 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see. :(
19:06:52 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec.
19:07:15 <strcat> I don't see any bans that match him
19:07:18 <strcat> I think the bridge is broken
19:07:53 <TheJollyRoger> Oh shoot. Him too!
19:08:11 <Guest989> Well, I will let y'all get to that. I can't think you enough for everything both of you!!! I'm gonna hop off now ,but I'll probbaly be back on at some point and regsiter an actual nick or something
19:08:13 <Guest989> Cheers :)
19:08:23 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: Okay, cheers!
19:08:31 <TheJollyRoger> I'll finish the rest of that thought some other time. Fare thee well.
19:09:01 <strcat[m]> @appservice-irc:matrix.org kicked faxing. Reason: IRC error on #grapheneos: err_bannedfromchan
19:09:02 <Guest989> Oh! You can now, too if you want! I can stick around a few
19:09:17 <Guest989> I thought you had, my mistake.
19:09:26 <strcat> TheJollyRoger:  /whois faxing[m]
19:09:36 <strcat> 14:09:22 freenode  -- | [faxing[m]] (faxingmatr@gateway/shell/matrix.org/x-yvvvdknolvwzzhri): org.matrix:faxing
19:09:43 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: just messaged him.
19:09:47 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: really need these matrix bans on matrix though
19:09:51 <strcat> it handles this badly
19:10:03 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: sorry, just a mo, I gotta figure out what the heck broke with the banlist here.
19:10:15 <Guest989> all good!
19:10:15 <strcat> I'm removing them all
19:10:17 <strcat> it's unmanageable
19:10:21 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: oh, I see.
19:10:46 <Guest989> It's like you're releasing the hounds from hell
19:10:52 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: please make the bans on Matrix for matrix
19:10:54 <strcat> and irc bans on irc
19:10:55 <Guest989> each one flying up from their prison
19:11:18 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: so, about a modern CPU - it's actually not a CPU at all but rather a networked interconnected distributed system of hundreds of thousands of CPUs that all work together to run a just in time compiler to emulate an ISA that traces its roots to way, way, way back in the 1970's.
19:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> There's nothing nefarious about this - if computer scientists didn't do this, this would mean we'd essentially have to throw out and rewrite all the heritage each time we ever changed *anything* with a CPU.
19:12:39 <TheJollyRoger> *if the chip vendors didn't do this
19:13:27 <Guest989> makes sense
19:13:45 <TheJollyRoger> The computing landscape today would look very much like how it was in the 1980's.
19:14:01 <strcat> rny: also you too, do the matrix bans on matrix pls
19:14:35 <TheJollyRoger> So, the thing about microcode, is that it allows the CPU vendors to be able to disable features that could be used as exploits, after the chip has been made.
19:15:05 <TheJollyRoger> Without having to do things like firmware mitigations which often carry with them *substantial* performance costs.
19:15:29 <Guest989> Like one of the recent few intel vulnerabilities
19:15:34 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: yup, you got it!
19:15:35 <Guest989> huge performance hits to patch
19:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's how they were able to quickly rush to get those issues fixed. Unfortunately, it came at a steep, steep, STEEP cost.
19:16:19 <Guest989> Definitely
19:16:42 <Guest989> Is Aurora store okay to use? I've got f-droid as well but not sure on aurora
19:16:50 <TheJollyRoger> (Even if an issue is mitigated in Microcode rather than firmware, it doesn't necessarily mean it's not going to not carry a big performance penalty)
19:16:51 <Guest989> obviously can't use playstore i don't think, not that i'd wnat to anyway
19:16:57 <strcat[m]> faxing: seems fine now?
19:16:59 <Guest989> Yeah, that's fair
19:17:16 <faxing[m]> Yeah
19:17:18 <faxing[m]> Thank you!
19:17:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hey faxing[m], welcome back.
19:17:57 <faxing[m]> Thanks!
19:18:07 <NBE1[m]> when will their be a rom for smasung note 20
19:18:12 <strcat> *!faxingmatr@gateway/shell/matrix.org/* banned by TheJollyRoger
19:18:17 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: it was that one
19:18:25 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: it was probably an accident, caught with the bot spam?
19:18:31 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: So that's the thing about hardware: it can have bugs and vulnerabilities, and exploits and if we want hardware to be secure, the best we can do is to make sure that there is a way to update it after the fact.
19:18:35 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: I think so.
19:18:35 <strcat> anyway please do matrix bans on matrix from now on
19:18:47 <strcat> and I removed a bunch of these IP bans
19:18:49 <Guest989> Makes sense to me!
19:18:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that, faxing and strcat.
19:19:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, must've been an accident >_<, my bad.
19:19:26 <TheJollyRoger> NBE1[m]: No, there will not and cannot be.
19:19:49 <TheJollyRoger> Samsung choose to disable the bootloader security features and leave you with an insecure device if you run any operating system that isn't theirs.
19:19:59 <TheJollyRoger> NBE1[m]: Samsung are hostile to it.
19:20:22 <Guest989> I'm migrating from an s10 to the pixel4a for graphene
19:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> NBE1[m]: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
19:21:12 <Guest989> Jolly, is the Aurora store okay to use?
19:21:17 <Guest989> in general
19:21:54 <TheJollyRoger> Guest989: well, app stores are generally covered under #grapheneos-offtopic, but Aurora Store generally has faster updates than F-Droid does. What you get varies, because it's a mirror of the Google Play store.
19:22:09 <TheJollyRoger> However, it averts a lot of the issues with F-Droid becoming a trusted third party to app distribution.
19:22:20 <TheJollyRoger> So if you can find what you need there and keep it up to date, by all means, use Aurora.
19:22:46 <Guest989> That's fair, thank you. I just wasn't sure if it was, itself, a security risk.
19:22:48 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m], strcat, it might've gotten swept up when I did the refactoring of the banlist by mistake. My bad.
19:23:31 <Jack8> When I'm doing the web based install on a Pixel 4XL. It failed on the flashing step. So I went to the command line one (Windows 10). I got through the steps until flashing. Then it failed on writing "product_b"

19:23:50 <TheJollyRoger> BRB
19:23:55 <strcat[m]> Jack8: sounds like you might not have enough disk space
19:23:58 <strcat[m]> can you check?
19:24:10 <Jack8> Fastboot: error:
19:24:11 <Jack8> failed to extract 'system.img': I/O error
19:24:18 <Jack8> Is that on my Pixel or on my PC?
19:24:18 <strcat[m]> it seems you're out of disk space
19:24:21 <strcat[m]> pc
19:24:51 <Jack8> Windows says I have 2.2GB free of 59.6 GB
19:25:03 <strcat[m]> not enough
19:25:10 <faxing[m]> How do you only have a 60GB drive is my question
19:25:15 <Jack8> Do you know where the web based installer downloads that image to?
19:25:16 <faxing[m]> Where did you even find that
19:25:21 <strcat[m]> Jack8: try running disk cleanup tool
19:25:38 <strcat[m]> Jack8: you need to probably have ~8GB minimum
19:25:46 <strcat[m]> uninstall some stuff etc
19:25:53 <Jack8> Oh that might be difficult. Seems I need to delete a lot
19:25:56 <Jack8> ok
19:26:25 <strcat[m]> BTW there's a new Pixel 3 (blueline) beta release with a camera fix
19:26:29 <strcat[m]> please test that if you have Pixel 3
19:26:45 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 XL (crosshatch) coming soon
19:29:29 <Guest989> god the search function in f-droid is so bad
19:34:38 <faxing[m]> I didn't think it was that bad, but I guess I don't use it that much.
19:38:23 <lartiklosac[m]> How do you add something to the calender app?
19:40:03 <entry1[m]> <lartiklosac[m] "How do you add something to the "> Its an android system app for functionality, not for use to edit
19:40:38 <entry1[m]> An off-topic suggestion is Etar that many people use (on F-Droid)
19:41:38 <Guest989> oh interesting, good to know. I was wondering the same. So it exists only because the android OS needs it to?
19:41:39 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.02.26.16 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2021.02.26.16

19:42:10 <strcat[m]> the Calendar app included in the OS is just included for compatibility
19:42:16 <strcat[m]> and we're likely going to hide the launcher icon
19:42:46 <strcat[m]> we would prefer removing it but it's needed for compatibility with apps trying to view calendar events via standard intents
19:43:34 <Guest989> I don't see Etar in f-droid
19:43:45 <strcat[m]> it's there
19:44:34 <Guest989> yeah, just fdroid search doing fdroid search things lol. I'll find it
19:45:05 <entry1[m]> Guest989 you can ask for app suggestions in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org and many would be happy to assist
19:46:11 <Guest989> Oh sweet, okay! Thank you. Sorry I haven't used IRC in a long long time probably 20 years. Don't really remember any of it. I need to get an irc client again and register a nick, methinks.
19:46:52 <strcat> can use either irc or matrix
19:47:17 <strcat> same channel for both (the bridge between them isn't perfect though)
19:47:29 <Guest989> I was going to try and get a matrix server going in docker but got distracted lol. too many projects going, such is life.
19:48:04 <strcat[m]> there's an unofficial telegram channel which we're going to be moving under the control of the project and trying to bridge to IRC too but it's tiny compared to this and we don't know how well bridging will work
19:48:49 <Guest989> Ah, fair enough. That will be interesting
19:49:09 <Guest989> I'm guessing the (m) at the end of some nicks is matrix?
19:49:32 <nscnt[m]> Guest989: Yes
19:50:50 <strcat> yes although you can tell matrix to use a nickname without that
19:51:19 <strcat> Guest989: basically there's a matrix.org irc bridge here which joins with a nickname for each person in the matrix channel
19:51:29 <strcat> and it sends stuff back and forth
19:51:41 <Guest989> Ah. Is Element the preferred matrix client?
19:51:44 <strcat> it represents each freenode irc user with a virtual matrix user and vice versa
19:51:46 <strcat> Guest989: yeah
19:51:47 <Guest989> I'm looking into it now
20:07:59 <sonic_the_hedgeh> Is there a way to configure the GrapheneOS AppsFilter to allow/whitelist application interaction? As it is, none of the apps i have installed can interact with my file manager.
20:12:45 <strcat[m]> sonic_the_hedgehog: unsure what you mean
20:13:02 <strcat[m]> apps within the same profile can communicate with mutual consent
20:13:39 <strcat[m]> sonic_the_hedgehog: if you're unable to open files in apps with the file manager, it's probably because it's an obsolete app not updated for how modern Android works
20:16:38 <codebam> they removed the file manager from stock so thanks for leaving it in
20:18:06 <codebam> or well they removed the shortcut to it
20:20:52 <sonic_the_hedgeh> ok thanks.
20:21:21 <sonic_the_hedgeh> its basically described here: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/package-visibility
20:26:09 <Guest989> is freenode the "homeserver" I need for matrix?
20:29:20 <nscnt[m]> Guest989: No, freenode is the IRC network that provides the IRC channel. You can use any homeserver if you want to use Matrix afaik. Matrix.org is the default one
20:31:13 <Guest989> oh hm, I do have an account on matrix.org - so then how can I connect to this server? Sorry pardon my ignorance
20:34:09 <Guest31156> I got disconnected, but I was guest989
20:34:29 <nscnt[m]> Guest31156: By searching and joining #grapheneos:matrix.org
20:36:19 <simmered[m]> Okay! In Matrix now! I was Guest989 and briefly 31156. But now I have an actual nick
20:36:27 <simmered[m]> Thank you
20:36:37 <nscnt[m]> No problem
20:37:13 <nscnt[m]> We have #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org as well
20:37:33 <simmered[m]> Yeah, that's what I was looking to join as well - so that acts as a separate room, yeah?
20:42:29 <Jack8> Ok I have 9 GB free now and I'll retry the install from the beginning.
20:49:40 <Jack8> I got a lot of error messages about "archive does not contain". Is that bad?

20:50:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Jack8, please be careful:
20:50:43 <TheJollyRoger> posting large text messages into IRC will cause spam protection to trip.
20:50:59 <TheJollyRoger> This is normal and expected but occasionally this gets tripped up by pasting like that.

20:51:52 <Jack8> Yeah
20:52:03 <TheJollyRoger> Test it by letting it start -- but *don't* start using the phone, we're not done yet.
20:52:14 <TheJollyRoger> Use vol up/vol down.
20:52:32 <TheJollyRoger> It's going to give you an ominous Orange Screen warning about software integrity not guaranteed, but that's OK we're just doing this to see if the operating system starts.
20:52:39 <TheJollyRoger> Next step we'll lock the bootloader.
20:52:52 <Jack8> Ok I'm on the google screen
20:52:58 <Jack8> Now the GrapheneOS logo
20:53:14 <jess> you can kick sigyn and invite her back next time there is spam
20:53:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The "Google" logo is a part of the bootloader, it just tells you who the OEM is
20:53:33 <TheJollyRoger> Hey jess, good to know, I think we'll leave her in place for now, since she comes in handy.
20:53:40 * jess nod
20:53:41 <Jack8> There's a fractal pentagon shaped image and a menu at the bottom that says next
20:53:48 <TheJollyRoger> Jack8 Great!
20:54:01 <TheJollyRoger> OK, you're on the home stretch now, switch the phone back off a sec?
20:54:25 <Jack8> Its its shut down
20:54:37 <TheJollyRoger> Ok hold down volume down and power until fastboot comes back up.
20:54:42 <Jack8> And then it booted back into the orange screen and now is just charging
20:55:01 <Jack8> Ok fastboot is back
20:55:04 <TheJollyRoger> Great, once fastboot is up, punch in "fastboot flashing lock"
20:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> Then look back at the screen.
20:55:15 <Jack8> fastboot flashing lock ?
20:55:17 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
20:55:17 <Jack8> Got it
20:56:50 <TheJollyRoger> The last step to do, once she's locked and you see bootloader locked, is to start the phone, complete the welcome screen (you can connect to wifi during this time), and open up Developer Options by going to "About Phone", tapping on "Build Number" ten times, and then going to Developer Options and sliding OEM Unlock to "Off."
20:57:16 <TheJollyRoger> After the bootloader's locked, the orange screen will be replaced with a yellow one that should tell you "your device is loading a different operating system."
20:57:19 <Jack8> Ok. Thanks goodness
20:57:26 <Jack8> Yes it said that
20:57:40 <TheJollyRoger> Great! If you see that yellow screen, then you know that the verified boot is on and enforcing.
20:57:50 <TheJollyRoger> Just that it's not enforcing to Google's keys, it's enforcing to GrapheneOS' keys.
20:58:01 <Jack8> So that screen always stays?
20:58:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. That screen always stays, unless you go back to Google's operating system.
20:58:32 <TheJollyRoger> You can skip it by tapping the power key and releasing it twice in rapid succession.
20:59:06 <TheJollyRoger> You can verify the authenticity of the keys by using Auditor.
20:59:18 <TheJollyRoger> Or using Attestation Server.
20:59:34 <TheJollyRoger> That allows you to know the keys are genuine, and if the keys are genuine, they ensure the operating system is genuine.
21:00:19 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that yellow screen goes and is replaced by the orange one, that you need to worry. Switching OEM unlocking off will require the phone to need to be factory reset via recovery in order to get at that setting again.
21:02:17 <nscnt[m]> For your education: https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/boot-flow
21:03:12 <TheJollyRoger> thanks, nscnt[m]!
21:03:53 <Jack8> Ok I read everything, disabled OEM unlocking and rebooted it.
21:04:19 <TheJollyRoger> Jack8: once the OEM unlocking toggle has been set to off, you will need to reboot your phone one last time, and then switch Developer Options to "Off." As tempting as some of them may look *don't touch them* if you want to use the device in production. They aren't intended to be used for tuning GrapheneOS, and may significantly increase attack surface of the device.
21:04:28 <TheJollyRoger> Jack8: Great!
21:04:39 <TheJollyRoger> Jack8: welcome aboard the ship P.-)
21:05:40 <Jack8> I'm sure you've had a lot more people joining lately. Any idea how many users there are now?
21:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> I don't even know if there's a way to tell about that, actually.
21:07:04 <TheJollyRoger> Sure we might be able to tell that the OTA file for a given device has been accessed say, X number of times, but we don't know if that's because X number of users are downloading it, or one user is downloading it X number of times.
21:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> test
21:07:21 <TheJollyRoger-M> test
21:07:31 <strcat> know how many update checks happen but the update client just makes *approximately* 1 check per 4 hours *when connected to a permitted type of network* (user configured)
21:07:52 <Jack8> Oh
21:09:18 <Jack8> It took me over a month to get to this point. I bought 2 bad Pixel phones off of ebay before I got a good one.
21:10:21 <Jack8> But I'm looking forward to having a less creepy experience with a smartphone and not feeling like its spying on me all the time.
21:14:15 <TheJollyRoger> Jack8: yeah, unfortunately what happens to a lot of people is that near the end of a device's life, the resellers essentially bail their wares and flood the market with low-priced phones that may appear to be a bargain.
21:14:21 <TheJollyRoger> But they're unusable, or broken, or refurbished.
21:15:39 <TheJollyRoger> That's rotten luck to hear you got hit with that twice, it's partially why we don't recommend holding out on older devices and to also avoid resellers at all costs, since a few members here have been cheated or gotten tricked into buying stolen goods.
21:16:30 <strcat[m]> the best deal is generally just buying the latest `a` variant
21:16:38 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a was $349 brand new
21:17:15 <Jack8> Well I found one good seller who is honest. I checked the IMEI on Google's RMA website. Still in warranty. And the remaining battery health according to AccuBattery is over 100%
21:17:19 <strcat[m]> when we have a device with a hardware partner it'll likely be significantly more than an `a` series Pixel cause much smaller batch of phones etc
21:18:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> <Jack8 "Well I found one good seller who"> Who was the seller?
21:18:53 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry about that little song and dance there. Should be fixed now.
21:19:00 <Jack8> Ebay username hexpro
21:19:30 <Jack8> Definitely do not trust smartphonesnparts
21:28:07 <zzxx123> strcat[m] do you have a price target?
21:29:13 <zzxx123> or it is not up to you
21:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> It wouldn't be up to us. The best would probably be if a vendor that wanted to support GrapheneOS built a handset on a Qualcomm reference device that would be fused to the real GrapheneOS vendor keys, then took it upon themselves to produce and sell them.
21:30:35 <TheJollyRoger> *the real GrapheneOS AVB keys, as vendor keys.
21:33:48 <TheJollyRoger> test2
21:36:15 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: ideally we're more involved than that and we're building the SoC firmware
21:36:17 <strcat> etc
21:36:19 <strcat> and the vendor SDK
21:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see.
21:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> Oh now THAT would be awesome.
21:38:00 <Jack8> I'm looking at you Sony
21:38:15 * TheJollyRoger winces.
21:41:21 <Jack8> Sorry bout that!
21:47:52 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL releases in Beta channel atm
21:47:56 <strcat[m]> need testing
21:48:04 <strcat[m]> camera should work properly again
22:01:59 <Jack894> Well I'll have to work on installing all of the apps etc later. Looks like its basically working so far. I loaded F Droid and the Aurora Store
22:02:23 <Jack894> It says Made with <3  in India which is appreciated
22:05:35 <bill_in_mtl[m]> <strcat[m] "and we're likely going to hide t"> Is it okay to disable the stock calendar app if replacing it or will it effect the compatibility ?
22:07:27 <simmered[m]> Hey Jolly I'm back, and have a real name now :) Was Guest898 (or 989?) earlier whom you helped. Got set up on Matrix via Element
22:14:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hey simmered[m], awesome, welcome back to the channel, glad to have you onboard!
22:15:50 <simmered[m]> Thanks! Me too. I'm slowly acquiring apps and I am really pleasantly surprised at how many work that I thought might not! Also, this might be off-topic so I can move over that direction for further app talk
22:29:19 <Jack894> Oh is there an off topic channel for that kind of app talk?
22:29:54 <simmered[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
22:30:06 <simmered[m]> I think it's for anything that isn't directly project related.
22:47:05 <strcat> tried to remove an old moderator with Element and it crashed Chromium
23:06:37 <manug[m]> Hi everyone. I have a question. If I want to audit my installation, i am the auditee, but who is the auditor? I dont know anyone who has GrapheneOS?
23:07:54 <strcat[m]> manug: it runs on Android
23:08:03 <strcat[m]> and there's also https://attestation.app/
23:08:12 <strcat[m]> look at https://attestation.app/about
23:11:41 <manug[m]> Thanks, so from what I read, it can be corrupted even after the bootloader is locked, so it is best to have the attestation app on to make automated regular checks?
23:15:06 <tmkb[m]> Quick question, does the pixel 5 still have 90hz on graphene
23:15:12 <tmkb[m]> * Quick question, does the pixel 5 still have 90hz on graphene?
23:23:03 <flawedworld[m]> <tmkb[m] "Quick question, does the pixel 5"> yes
23:23:35 <tmkb[m]> Sweet
23:45:35 <strcat[m]> manug: don't know what you're reading
23:45:37 <strcat[m]> manug: there's verified boot
23:49:52 <emdevd> I'm guessing I should take it that this future grapheneos custom hardware would be quite a bit more expensive than $400 new
23:50:08 <abaker> New user, just flashed my 4a 5G ~24 hours ago, sorry if this is a noob question. I'm testing location features for my app. I can get my last known location and location updates, but I can't get proximity alerts to fire. Should proximity alerts work in GrapheneOS?
