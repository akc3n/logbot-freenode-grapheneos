00:08:06 <qubits> Hello is there any solution for push notifications on grapheneos, i noticed when my device is locked i dont recieve anymore put notifcations
00:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hello qubits, by default notifications are hidden on the lockscreen as a part of the "safe by default" settings GrapheneOS ships with.
00:14:56 <TheJollyRoger> That said,
00:15:20 <TheJollyRoger> push notifications are normally handled by Google Play Services in most apps, including some apps like Protonmail. Signal includes its own handler for push notifications, but it must run in the background to retrieve them.
00:15:45 <TheJollyRoger> With Play Services absent, some apps like Protonmail that rely on Play Services to implement push notifications will not display notifications until you open the app.
00:16:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ΛD ΛSTRΛ++> @strcat thanks
00:16:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!ΛD ΛSTRΛ++> accident
00:27:01 <qubits> i installed headwind mdm open source becouse they have own push notifications protocol base on MQTT but still i m facing some issues when locked after 5m it will not appear untill i unlock device
00:58:57 <lumpenqueer[m]> Any reason that a file transfer from my device to a USB stick would fail?
00:59:13 <lumpenqueer[m]> USB stick is readable
00:59:23 <lumpenqueer[m]> And the stick has enough room
01:00:30 <entry1[m]> How much are you moving? Big files can experience issues depending on how many files you are moving
01:00:44 <entry1[m]> Try a different port and a different cable lumpenqueer
01:05:59 <lumpenqueer[m]> And other transfers we successfull
01:06:50 <lumpenqueer[m]> <entry1[m] "Try a different port and a diffe"> I'm using a type c to a adaptor and a thumb drive
01:33:59 <m2tu[m]> @strcat or an one else who know about build sstem here ?
01:36:58 <m2tu[m]> I have downloaded repo and build blueline and want to build for pixel 4 also flame version
01:38:07 <m2tu[m]> do i need to download full repo again and ned dsk of 300 gb or s there an wa to get flame version into m current repo ?
02:06:48 <timetravelingman> Man is speaking the language of the gods
02:19:35 <e55dd> hello
02:20:07 <e55dd> I had posted something on the reddit channel, but I will paste it here:
02:20:18 <e55dd> How to transfer files from GrapheneOS to Linux Ubuntu?
02:20:19 <e55dd> I am trying to transfer some files from my GrapheoneOS (installed on a Pixel 3a) to my Linux Ubuntu 20.04.
02:20:19 <e55dd> My phone is not locked, I unlock it before plugging to the pc.
02:20:20 <e55dd> I connect the phone to the computer with an USB cable. Pop up appears on the pc and I have the option to select "Open With Files". I click there, it takes me to my phone's folder, but it says that the folder is empty.
02:20:20 <e55dd> If I try to copy a file inside this folder, I get "permissions do not allow pasting files in this directory".
02:20:21 <e55dd> So it seems its a permissions issue. But on Grapheneos I go to Settings - Privacy - Permission Manager, and there is nothing there to allow computer to interact with phone or something like that.
02:20:21 <e55dd> Can somebody help? Thanks
02:21:07 <timetravelingman> Did you check whether file transfers are enabled on the phone my man
02:21:29 <timetravelingman> Open the notification tray and click the notification for transferring files, and click the option that allows you to transfer files
02:21:45 <timetravelingman> It's like that for android, it isn't different for grapheneOS in that regard
02:24:51 <edu321> Hello
02:25:10 <edu321> I pasted a question before and got banned, so I'm gonna write it now
02:25:37 <edu321> I am trying to figure out how to transfer files from GrapheneOS to Linux Ubuntu
02:25:47 <edu321> I am trying to transfer some files from my GrapheoneOS (installed on a Pixel 3a) to my Linux Ubuntu 20.04.
02:25:52 <sphinx[m]> no need to post it again
02:26:07 <edu321> ok!
02:26:32 <sphinx[m]> someone replied to you: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210315#c7256353
02:30:20 <edu321> @timetravelingman thanks a lot mate.  I didn't see the notification on the phone, I think now it's gonna work
02:58:14 <rawtaz> how many eSIM can you store in grapheneos (unless it depends on the device of course)?
03:00:03 <entry1[m]> <rawtaz "how many eSIM can you store in g"> eSIM is not supported
03:00:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hi rawtaz, right now GrapheneOS does support eSIM, but we don't have a frontend to configure it. Since it's provisioned in the phone's secure element, rather than in the operating system, some people have found a clever workaround by configuring it on the factory OS and then doing some workaround, but this is a hack, and not a permanent solution.
03:00:45 <TheJollyRoger> So at the moment, go with what entry1[m] said.
03:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> *but this is a hack that could stop working at any time, and is not a permanent solution.
03:01:12 <rawtaz> oh my. i didnt know that, that means i cant use this phone cuz it only has one sim slot (i thought it had two when i ordered it)
03:01:29 <TheJollyRoger> Help is wanted on developing the eSIM configuration app.
03:01:34 <rawtaz> yeah i bet
03:01:58 <rawtaz> what would that entail? im presuming it's not a matter of writing a little html app :P
03:02:05 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. It's a very high priority item right now, just developer hours are a limited resource.
03:02:05 <entry1[m]> Much more detailed response TheJollyRoger thank you and sorry if I misrepresented it with the briefness
03:02:13 <TheJollyRoger> entry1[m]: oh no no no, don't be sorry, you're good!
03:02:24 <rawtaz> entry1[m]: all input is valuable
03:02:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it helps! :)
03:03:01 <rawtaz> but it was really good to know what you said too TheJollyRoger. i was curious and ducked around on how eSIMs are stored just a few minutes ago
03:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> Besides, if it's only done because of a series of kludgy, hinky workarounds in a matter that could stop working at any moment I'd say you're correct ;).
03:03:19 <TheJollyRoger> So all is good :)
03:03:47 <rawtaz> i took a look at the build instructions and as i understand it the code takes around 90 GB
03:03:51 <TheJollyRoger> rawtaz: yeah, it's kind of fascinating to think they're stored in the secure element, which allows the phone to use the keys contained in the secure element, but not be able to pull them back out.
03:04:06 <strcat[m]> it's a whole history of the code in the repositories
03:05:22 <rawtaz> oh boy, lots of memory needed too. haha this is not a small thing to build :D
03:05:52 <strcat[m]> it's a whole OS
03:06:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, yep. It's big! But it's also a collection of a lot of different, and distinct little pieces that all work together. So it's possible to work on certain parts of the operating system, rather than as a whole.
03:07:52 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: the only OS i built from source is linux and it wasnt this big
03:08:15 <strcat[m]> this is a Linux-based OS
03:08:17 <strcat[m]> you seem confused
03:08:26 <strcat[m]> I doubt you built a whole Linux-based OS from source before
03:09:43 <strcat[m]> the Linux kernel is one component of a Linux-based OS
03:10:09 <strcat[m]> and the Linux kernel does take an enormous time to build when using Clang CFI (Control Flow Integrity) for security as is the case for AOSP / GrapheneOS on Pixels
03:10:13 <rawtaz> im thinking about the kernel and userland in bsd/linux, but i could be wrong
03:10:33 <strcat[m]> but as you can see from the build instructions you don't have to build the kernel since there are prebuilts
03:10:43 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: you're confused, and I would appreciate it if you didn't spread misinformation here, thanks
03:11:13 <rawtaz> what misinformation did i spread?
03:11:16 <TheJollyRoger> rawtaz: Usually when you use emerge, to update something like Gentoo, it only downloads the source code for that specific release of the packages you are building and installing.
03:11:38 <TheJollyRoger> So that's why downloading source for say, Gentoo, is going to be smaller.
03:11:51 <TheJollyRoger> Because it won't have all the years of history going back to when the project first started.
03:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> In the case of GrapheneOS, the project started around ~2014, so every change that ever happened to the project ever is logged, all the way back to that start date.
03:12:40 <TheJollyRoger> The upstream android open source project goes back even further.
03:12:57 <strcat[m]> there are also a bunch of external projects with their own histories
03:13:16 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: you're comparing building the Linux kernel (which is part of GrapheneOS and AOSP) to building the OS as a whole
03:13:45 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: i never talked about the kernel alone, i dont know what makes you assume that
03:13:57 <rawtaz> and i dont know why you call this "spreading misinformation"
03:13:57 <strcat[m]> I'm not assuming that, it's what you said
03:13:59 <strcat[m]> Linux is a kernel
03:14:01 <rawtaz> no
03:14:09 <rawtaz> sure
03:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys, we can be friends here.
03:14:43 <TheJollyRoger> rawtaz: You're actually in luck since I recently updated a gentoo-amd64 system that hadn't been powered on in a few months, and it had to rebuild roughly 400 packages from source; on my old Ryzen 2600 system, it took a little over 24 hours.
03:15:05 <rawtaz> strcat[m]: you are right that i said linux and that technically that is a kernel only. then again we have the fact that pretty much everyone and their cat doesnt go around saying GNU/Linux and all that stuff - in common speech linux is what people call the distribution, the entire OS
03:15:32 <strcat[m]> there are plenty of Linux distributions, and only a subset use a bunch of GNU components
03:15:39 <TheJollyRoger> But that's a full desktop, with Thunderbird and two web browsers, and Digikam, and GIMP, and a whole whackload of other stuff I installed with it.
03:16:05 <rny> i'd like a linux distro that does not use gnu binutils at all
03:16:18 <TheJollyRoger> By comparison, if I am to build GrapheneOS from source, it takes the same computer roughly 2-1/2 hours to build the entire operating system (plus the kernel), and roughly 3-1/2 hours to build Vanadium.
03:16:27 <rawtaz> TheJollyRoger: fancy that. i never used gentoo
03:16:37 <strcat[m]> rny: only `as` is really used as this point by AOSP
03:16:55 <strcat[m]> should be dropped soon
03:17:08 <TheJollyRoger> rawtaz: It's just a personal choice, that's all, but it might be able to be a useful comparison in this one particular instance.
03:17:12 <strcat[m]> makes cross-compilation simpler since LLVM toolchain is a cross-compiler for every supported platform
03:17:19 <rny> isnt there llvm-as?
03:17:20 <rny> :P
03:17:23 <strcat[m]> rny: there is
03:17:27 <rny> why do they still need GNU as
03:17:41 <strcat[m]> because stuff has non-portable GNU extensions in the assembly not fully supported by LLVM
03:17:51 <strcat[m]> it's close to being usable
03:18:12 <strcat[m]> rny: also worth noting all the LLVM stuff is done as a library so Clang actually won't work `as` but rather it runs via the library
03:18:17 <strcat[m]> there is a CLI tool for it
03:18:21 <strcat[m]> but it's not how it will run
03:18:38 <strcat[m]>  * rny: also worth noting all the LLVM stuff is done as a library so Clang actually won't run `llvm-as` but rather it runs via the library
03:18:39 <rny> that makes sense
03:18:51 <rny> cant imagine anyone using as directly
03:18:54 <rawtaz> seeing as at this point im not contributing anything to GrapheneOS, and i dont have the resources to even try to do it, and being *unintentionally* "confused" is apparently equivalent to spreading misinformation, it seems to me that it would be more appreciated that i dont spent time here at all. cuz im confused every now and then, and spreading misinformation is not wanted.
03:19:12 <rawtaz> i wish you all a good day, and kudos for making this great OS!
03:19:13 <rawtaz> bye
03:19:16 <strcat[m]> rawtaz: I interpreted what you were doing as a form of concern trolling
03:19:22 <TheJollyRoger> Well, shoot.
03:19:23 <strcat[m]> increasing clear it's what they were doing
03:19:50 <strcat> 1 less concern troll
03:20:15 <TheJollyRoger> I... don't think he was concern trolling, just a little confused.
03:20:21 <strcat> they are concern trolling
03:23:18 <TheJollyRoger> Captain, if we keep driving away everyone like this before we've had a chance to straighten people out, it's not going to bode well for us.
03:23:24 <strcat> stop
03:23:43 <strcat> you've been causing problems recently and making things worse
03:23:45 <strcat> it's not helpful
03:24:10 <strcat> you essentially helped people spraed false narratives about GrapheneOS in that other channel and legitimized people who are harassing/bullying me and making up stories
03:24:30 <strcat> this isn't the place to discuss moderation decisions
03:24:38 <strcat> and that person left on their own
03:25:22 <TheJollyRoger> Y-yes sir.
03:25:24 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
03:36:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Why is it.
03:37:36 <strcat> discussed things with rawtaz and the issue is resolved
03:38:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> No, I am not talking about that. Over at AOSPAlliance, Peter got threatened to be kicked and did not even complain... though somebody said it could have been a joke, it still does not sound good to me.
03:38:54 <strcat> hm are there messages not coming through the bridge?
03:39:02 <strcat> all I saw is 'Why is it.'
03:40:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Because I think Peter is being way too peaceful. It is not fair for people to gang up on him or us like that, and then he is like a-okay with it.
03:40:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Is it just his way of being or...?
03:41:34 <TheJollyRoger> @gochoingles - that part about "go and eat" was a joke.
03:44:40 <strcat[m]> keep in mind AOSP Alliance is basically just controlled by CalyxOS and is not actually open to collaboration and other points of view in practice
03:44:59 <strcat[m]> it's essentially just another of their channels
03:45:53 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what happened there recently or exactly what you're talking about
03:46:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: I was talking about the part where you said you were going to take a break from the computer (understandable, 0:00 o-clock) and then the AOSP-Alliance mod like
03:46:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> "you better do or I will kick you"
03:47:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I think he was the owner of the project.
03:47:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> csrnic or whatever his name was
03:48:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, that part is a joke because I was saying "guys, I really need to get off the computer because I need to eat, uh, guys? GUYS?" and nobody was responding.
03:51:34 <strcat[m]> we're looking for developers to pay to work on various projects including an eSIM activation app + eSIM build configuration in the OS, modern app install/update system built on top of the OS package manager, memory tagging for QEMU, etc.
03:51:39 <strcat[m]> lots of other things too
03:51:47 <strcat[m]> so if people are actually interested in that stuff get in touch
03:52:25 <strcat[m]> we have a lot of funding available to pay developers, and a lack of interested developers with the necessary skills/knowledge
03:52:48 <strcat[m]> we can pay people for full-time work too
03:52:49 <rny> hire me? :P
03:52:54 <strcat[m]> sure
03:52:56 <strcat[m]> you are busy though
03:53:04 <rny> in july :P
03:53:20 <strcat[m]> we can actually afford to hire multiple full time developers
03:53:30 <strcat[m]> and I expect soon we won't be paying legal fees anymore
03:54:40 <skagreek[m]> I really feel for you guys on the legal stuff. It not only drains the money, but the mental strength to focus on productivity. Hope it all works out for you.
03:55:11 <TheJollyRoger> Same here.
03:56:14 * rny ties string around forehead.

04:57:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Is GOS programmed in C? I want to study the programming language — I am looking for a book I can buy here at Venezuela.
05:07:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Oh, pity! C++.Well. It has a bit of C programming lines so I could still join it.

06:32:57 <pizzaeater69[m]> Hi
06:57:15 <TinfoilEnthusias> Anyone know approximately how how much non-free and proprietary software is included in GOS?
06:58:15 <pizzaeater69[m]> GrapheneOS is open source
06:58:33 <pizzaeater69[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS
06:59:49 <TinfoilEnthusias> <pizzaeater69[m] "GrapheneOS is open source"> Right but I thought it includes at least some non-free software?
07:25:36 <Thatcher[m]> Question about user profiles:
07:25:36 <Thatcher[m]> I have not much experience with user profiles, but is it possible to designate a vpn only to a specific user profile or does the vpn have to be installed and controlled in owner profile?
07:26:16 <Thatcher[m]> Btw, I'm terrible at asking questions. Pardon my noobness
07:32:45 <Thatcher[m]> My goal is that I want to have only one user profile designated to utilize the vpn.

07:35:36 <Thatcher[m]> Oh hell yeah!
07:50:16 <Thatcher[m]> I just love tinkering around with this OS. It's a dream for my OCD because of how much control I have over the system and permissions. I can just set it and forget it. Really awesome stuff.
07:50:36 <Thatcher[m]> Thank you Daniel and team
08:13:40 <bypassbobby[m]> Is it possible to install briar messenger on owner and another profile?
08:16:25 <pizzaeater69[m]> Yes
08:16:41 <pizzaeater69[m]> You are probably installing an older version of briar on the second profile than the main profile one so thats why it might not work
08:18:52 <bypassbobby[m]> Think I used same briar off the official site but I'll double check
10:38:40 <anotherguy[m]> Hi, any keybase user here ? I can't find any links for direct apk download

13:54:53 <pizzaeater69[m]> <Guest26717 "Is it possible to transfer conta"> Contacts will transfer with your SIM card if you have one. For files I would just move them to computer and than to the GrapheneOS
13:55:39 <Guest26717> ok , thanks pizzaeater69!
13:57:29 <pizzaeater69[m]> Note that you have to save contacts to the sim card on your iPhone and not internal storage
14:01:09 <Guest26717> ok, I will try to do that.
14:02:28 <Guest26717> Also sorry for being so uninformed, how do I get the f-droid on my grapheneos? Do I download it on my computer and sync it somehow  or can I download it to the phone?
14:02:54 <s0s[e]> Just download the apk to your phone..
14:03:19 <jere1878> Hey guys,
14:03:19 <jere1878> I just moved from iPhone to Grapheneos, still learning stuff. I am trying to find out how to verify .apk files on my phone. Is there a GPG app that I can use, or something like that?
14:04:01 <s0s[e]> use fdroid store https://f-droid.org/
14:04:06 <s0s[e]> or auroraoss also nice
14:04:19 <s0s[e]> https://auroraoss.com/
14:05:00 <jere1878> If I want to download a .apk file that is not on F-droid or Aurora
14:08:09 <jere1878> for example, I want to download f-droid and verify the developer signatures
14:09:40 <pizzaeater69[m]> When you download apps from fdroid or aurora they are automaticly verified
14:15:47 <jere1878> I mean, when I download f-droid.apk or aurora.apk
14:16:19 <jere1878> actually I was able to do it, but I used Termux and it was very clumsy. I thought maybe there was an app to do it more easily
14:17:22 <s0s[e]> no app as far as i know
14:25:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> if you first install F-Droid apk (i recommend FoxyDroid) or AuroraStore, you need to allow this unknown sourceCan be done with Vanadium. No need for insecure Termux or other terminal solutions
14:33:29 <jere1878> GrapheneOS-Teleg not sure I understood. You mean if I use Vanadium to download the F-Droid.apk, then I am safe and there is no need to verify?
14:42:29 <battles> Does anyone know if you can get a good web install on Windows 7?
15:00:18 <flawedworld[m]> <battles "Does anyone know if you can get "> It *may* work, but it's not supported by the project. Also you should seriously update to Windows 10.
15:22:15 <battles> No W10 for me!  Microsoft was caught red handed downloading personal files from W10 machines when it first came out.  I may install Ubuntu on an older machine and go that way.  I am still trying to decide if I should purchase a pixel and install GOS.  I know Wondows and Linux, but the install instructions are quite complex.  I am afraid that
15:22:15 <battles> GOS will not become used by most people because of the complexity of the install instructions.  There are some instructions that a user must already know that are not intuitive.
15:23:30 <strcat> please take the misinformation and concern trolling elsewhere
15:24:09 <strcat> this isn't a place to spread attacks on other operating systems
15:24:32 <strcat> and I really don't understand what you think isn't covered by the web install guide

15:26:33 <battles> The mark of someone who can't take constructive criticism - accuse others of being a troll.  I was replying to flaweworld's comment about needing to 'seriously update to Windows 10'.
15:27:04 <strcat> ok
15:27:13 <strcat> you're here to concern troll, not to ask legitimate questions or seek help
15:27:16 <strcat> cya
15:28:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Does anyone have a link to which algos are supported by the Pixel Secure Elements? According to Source Android Dot Com, Androids API to them has AES with a not specified set of modes, RSA and ECC with NIST Curves. But it doesnt seem like that is 1:1 to the actual chips capability.
15:28:47 <strcat[m]> are you asking about the hardware keystores?
15:28:48 <strcat[m]> or something else
15:28:51 <strcat[m]> you need to be more specific
15:29:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Yes Hardware Keystore / "Titan" /...
15:30:05 <strcat[m]> the documentation they have on the site covers the hardware keystores well
15:30:06 <strcat[m]> there are 2
15:30:27 <strcat[m]> it's not the only functionality provided by the TEE and secure element
15:31:11 <strcat[m]> the secure element driver sources are pretty simple and the userspace part of those shows the APIs pretty clearly
15:32:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> What I care for is what the hardware itself can do if I used them without androids abstraction. Oh ok. Nevermind. I thought companies as big as Google would actually write about it outside of the driver source.
15:32:40 <strcat[m]> it is written about
15:32:49 <strcat[m]> it's covered really well on the site
15:33:02 <strcat[m]> I just talked above about how concern trolling isn't an acceptable way to seek help / information
15:33:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Then I am just too dense to find it
15:33:21 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore#HardwareSecurityModule
15:33:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Is that already concern trolling? Its just minimal snarky
15:33:37 <strcat[m]> there is a bunch of documentation on the hardware keystores
15:33:44 <strcat[m]> just please don't do that
15:35:03 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> For I didnt find any of that using DDG readily, all the link trees lead to the gcloud marketing page. This is explicitly not concern trolling, its just explaining why I even asked.
15:36:32 <strcat[m]> DuckDuckGo isn't a very good search engine and isn't good for technical searches
15:37:39 <strcat[m]> you're far better off using the search on the site itself
15:38:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Also thanks for posting a direct link!
15:38:54 <strcat[m]> as an example of how the documentation is set up
15:39:09 <strcat[m]> https://source.android.com/security/keystore/attestation is documentation on the design of key attestation
15:39:16 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-key-attestation is a guide on using it as a developer
15:40:44 <strcat[m]> and then there are the actual API docs
15:49:19 <strcat[m]> the documentation there is generic and doesn't cover all device-specific stuff
15:49:34 <strcat[m]> the keystore stuff isn't device-specific though
16:07:47 <MrSenshi[m]> Is seed vault safe to use?
16:07:59 <MrSenshi[m]> * Is seedvault safe to use?
16:10:17 <strcat[m]> unclear what exactly you're asking
16:10:21 <strcat[m]> need to be more specific
16:10:34 <ulmirdin[m]> It's just used for backups.MrSenshi
16:12:09 <MrSenshi[m]> Launched seed vault using an activities launcher. Can I expect it to work reliably, backing up data without posing a major risk?
16:12:49 <ulmirdin[m]> It's stored on your device
16:12:58 <ulmirdin[m]> It's as secure as your other files
16:13:56 <MrSenshi[m]> :/ It _is_ supposed to be encrypted...
16:13:59 <MrSenshi[m]> I selected internal storage and it hangs at "Initialising backup location..."
16:14:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> I restored a bunch of times with it and it was to date the most reliable android backup thing for me. I also lost the key once.As usual apps can set a flag in their manifest that they dont want to be backed up. Those will not be included. As far as my last status of this is there is no switch to bypass that.
16:15:21 <MrSenshi[m]> Alright, perfect.
16:31:28 <MrSenshi[m]> Huh, doesn't back up...
16:31:43 <MrSenshi[m]> How am I supposed to enable seedvault?
16:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> MrSenshi[m]: the app data and contact list that seedvault backs up is *always* encrypted.
16:37:13 <MrSenshi[m]> Edit: Backups don't work for non-admin users??
16:37:15 <MrSenshi[m]> Why?
16:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> MrSenshi[m]: At this moment the seedvault developers have not added that functionality yet. That bug must be filed upstream with seedvault.
16:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> MrSenshi[m]: normally, seedvault is enabled by going to Settings -> System -> Backup.
16:40:26 <TheJollyRoger> The easiest way to use it is to back up to a USB drive. Again, sensitive data that seedvault backs up is stored encrypted. You could put it on an untrusted cloud server with complete confidence that the data is as safe as your 12 word recovery sentence is.
16:40:34 <TheJollyRoger> And as safe as the cipher is.
16:54:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> looks like Seedvault can soon backup whole internal storage:https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/pull/221
16:54:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Hab ich schon gelesen
16:54:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Brauch ich nur noch nen coolen Backupadapter
16:54:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Ich hab jetzt was cooles entdeckt wie ich aus Scheiß den ich shcon hab nen lowpower server machen kann
16:55:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Bei dem ich auch Bootloder signieren kann
16:55:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> sry wrong chat
16:56:09 <TheJollyRoger> Haha, oops. XP
16:56:22 <TheJollyRoger> Don't worry, I do that too all the time
16:56:45 <sjsndnjdejd> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<NorwegianFrost> looks like Seed"> That’s really nice
17:06:57 <strcat[m]> that doesn't mean what you think
17:07:11 <strcat[m]> that's about backing up the profile's home directory in addition to what it already does
17:08:10 <strcat[m]> it still won't back up other profiles and it doesn't change how it backs up app data and OS data
17:11:47 <strcat[m]> that's not going to change
17:11:54 <strcat[m]> the fundamental way it works isn't going to change
17:15:40 <strcat[m]> the possible improvements are backing up profile home directory, supporting secondary profiles and treating allowBackup="false" for API 30+ as not disabling device-to-device backups as documented for API 30+ (but it appears the actual implementation of this may be delayed in AOSP)
17:15:45 <strcat[m]>  * the possible improvements are backing up profile home directory, supporting secondary profiles and treating allowBackup="false" for API 30+ as not disabling device-to-device backups as documented for API 30+ (but it appears the actual implementation of this may be delayed in AOSP/stock)
17:16:02 <strcat[m]> the whole point of Seedvault is that it uses the OS backup APIs to reliably make robust, portable backups that are safe and not broken
17:16:03 <strcat[m]> that's not changing
17:19:10 <jalb>  /clear
17:22:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on tight everyone, bridge is resetting.
17:22:14 <jalb> anyone knows if using another profile I'd receive some notificacion about new GOS update, or only in the main profile?
17:22:25 <TheJollyRoger> jalb: only in the main profile, unfortunately.
17:22:34 <jalb> ok thanks TheJollyRoger
17:22:35 <TheJollyRoger> Er, sorry, only in the owner profile.
17:22:41 <jalb> yes, I understood
17:22:50 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
17:24:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <N​orwegianFrost> @strcat Thanks for the explanation 👍
17:24:47 <jalb> Apart from widgets not working all is great using another profile in my daily life
17:24:51 <jalb> Thanks for that
17:26:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> How do you use multiple profiles? I find them too cumbersome for my usage in their current state. Because I want to separate different roles and notifications from other profiles are essential.
17:33:47 <jcb97> hello it worked!!!
17:33:55 <jcb97> itwas the cable..
17:34:47 <jcb97> Now is there a repository of "friendly" android Apps..? is cool to see a phone to its bare minimum but there are things one needs to install
17:34:52 <Duxy[m]> Can you install whatsapp/signal in 2 profiles?
17:35:04 <jcb97> thanks again.. ANKER way to go
17:36:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <A​ngry_Lasagna> Yes you can use them in as many profiles as you have storage and different phone numbers for.
17:39:40 <Duxy[m]> So I do need a different phone number. That was what I was thinking. I wanna seperate my family/friends whatsapp from other whatsapp contacts but I guess there's no other way than getting a second phone  number.
17:49:52 <sjsndnjdejd> Get a virtual number
18:39:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on everyone, the Matrix side should come back soon.
18:48:04 <TheJollyRoger> Everyone made it back...?
18:53:33 <billinmtl[m]> where did we go ?
18:55:54 <M3manu31[m]> I just want to say I 🥰 GrapheneOS. Thanks for all the effort and time you put into it. Thank you
19:01:49 <pizzaeater69[m]> <battlepad[m] "Hey guys, would it be safe to us"> Depends on your threat model. But using it and denying permissions for it like sensors and network etc should make it better
19:03:18 <battlepad[m]> For my threat model i just dont want companies harvesting my data
19:03:53 <battlepad[m]> Just to ask, what exactly is the sensors permission in grapheneOS?
19:14:13 <ultimateextras[m> How does a "proper" installtion of GrapheneOS compare to something like a competently configured Linux Distro running on a Laptop or Desktop in terms of privacy/anonymity?
19:14:58 <TheJollyRoger> Hello ultimateextras[m, there's a lot of difference, I can only go into a few things here.
19:15:33 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "Hello ultimateextras, there's a "> Do tell.
19:15:57 <TheJollyRoger> First up, even on hardened Gentoo with SELinux the desktop is a free-for-all. Anything run under the same user account, runs in the same process space and has full access to other processes within the same account.
19:16:06 <flawedworld[m]> <ultimateextras[m "How does a "proper" installtion "> You can set GrapheneOS to blend in with other Android devices with regard to network traffic which does in turn make you stick out far less on the network side of things.
19:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> Secondly, X11 has few effective ways to isolate keystrokes - one app can sniff, spoof, and inject keystrokes into another app. This includes the password when you su -
19:17:33 <flawedworld[m]> <flawedworld[m] "You can set GrapheneOS to blend "> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
19:18:09 <TheJollyRoger> On GrapheneOS, processes do the equivalent of running as separate users; they are fully sandboxed and cannot interact with other applications. Even the graphical layer is isolated - apps cannot even snarf the contents of the clipboard when they are not in foreground!
19:20:11 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "Hello ultimateextras, there's a "> Alright, sounds pretty solid. How does it hold up in various threat models?
19:20:57 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: This is only the beginning. Each instance of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical, down to the very last bit, and is fully reproducible (deterministically compiled). It's verified on boot by the late-stage qualcomm bootloader, which gives you an open-source root of trust.
19:21:19 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: you'll have to be a bit more specific than that. But I'd probably suggest starting with the FAQ.
19:21:37 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "ultimateextras: you'll have to b"> Right.
19:22:51 <TheJollyRoger> Android, and by extension GrapheneOS also has an extremely sophisticated block-level filesystem encryption system. GrapheneOS builds on this by allowing you to eject the keys for profiles when you're done, and place them at rest when they are not in use.
19:23:44 <TheJollyRoger> At no point is any plaintext written to the disk unencrypted; it's heavily granularized and uses the security chip to ensure that even a weak four digit pincode would take 650 years to brute force.
19:24:04 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "At no point is any plaintext wri"> NIce.
19:24:26 <flawedworld[m]> ultimateextras: At a high level overview, I'll say this, the desktop security model is fundamentally broken. Operating systems like Android and iOS kind of lead the way with this.
19:24:27 <TheJollyRoger> Contrast this with a desktop, which simply uses one key for the entire disk, all at once, so once the computer is powered on, there is no protection!
19:25:02 <ultimateextras[m> <flawedworld[m] "ultimateextras: At a high level "> That's definitely a first.
19:25:34 <flawedworld[m]> Operating systems like ChromeOS on Chromebooks and macOS on Apple Silicon is kind of where desktop security is beginning to catch up.
19:26:35 <ultimateextras[m> <flawedworld[m] "Operating systems like ChromeOS "> (Evidently, It kind of goes without saying that anyone who values privacy would still want to void those.)
19:26:51 <ultimateextras[m> > <@flawedworld:matrix.org> Operating systems like ChromeOS on Chromebooks and macOS on Apple Silicon is kind of where desktop security is beginning to catch up.
19:26:51 <ultimateextras[m>  * (Evidently, It kind of goes without saying that anyone who values privacy would still want to avoid those.)
19:28:47 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: not necessarily. Most of the more invasive google stuff doesn't do this without consent, or telling you in the terms of service. As a result, most of the invasive stuff can be switched off. It's still possible to set them up in a fairly privacy-preserving way, so bear that in mind. It's important to take this nuance into account when giving thought toward security and privacy.
19:28:48 <flawedworld[m]> <flawedworld[m] "Operating systems like ChromeOS "> But there is no silver bullet to this matter really, like Windows is doing some pretty cool stuff with hypervisor based protection: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/device-guard-and-credential-guard but it doesn't have a verified boot system.
19:29:14 <flawedworld[m]> > <@flawedworld:matrix.org> Operating systems like ChromeOS on Chromebooks and macOS on Apple Silicon is kind of where desktop security is beginning to catch up.
19:29:14 <flawedworld[m]>  * But there is no silver bullet to this matter really, like Windows is doing some pretty cool stuff with hypervisor based protection: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/device-guard-and-credential-guard but it doesn't have a verified boot system (for example).
19:30:21 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "ultimateextras: not necessarily."> Fair enough.
19:33:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. I want to make sure that people don't fall into the trap of arbitrarily trying to throw everything into arbitrary "good" and "bad" boxes and forgetting nuance and complexity... that's how we end up in situations where people just blindly believe "Linux is more secure" and then going into denial or coming up with petty excuses when Microsoft comes up with ways to transparently virtualize
19:33:44 <TheJollyRoger> the browser and office suite in a disposable virtual machine without impacting the user experience, and virtualize the graphical layer so that applications have their keystrokes isolated, something that Linux is nowhere near doing intelligently.
19:34:26 <TheJollyRoger> But this is offtopic, so I'd like to focus on GrapheneOS here.
19:35:48 <ultimateextras[m> I've read the FAQ for Graphene OS previously, how effective would GrapheneOS be at privacy and protection against "would be" snoopers like carriers (or the NSA and friends) if I take a fairly redundant (but all around useful (as well as being something I already do for the most part at home on various linux computers)) approach and exclusively use Tor (likely with bridges) for basically everything I do (at the
19:35:48 <ultimateextras[m> moment, I am most definitely not comfortable using SSH to connect to my server at home from a carrier smartphone, tor or no tor.
19:36:21 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: Again, this is all a matter of where you draw the line. For instance,
19:36:33 <TheJollyRoger> I'd like you to take a thought experiment here:
19:36:59 <TheJollyRoger> Write a letter to one of your loved ones, put it in an envelope with neither destination nor return address, attach sufficient postage, and put it in the mail.
19:37:01 <ultimateextras[m> (Alright...I'll play.)
19:37:25 <TheJollyRoger> The post office can't deliver that message, nor send it back to you.
19:37:31 <TheJollyRoger> Because they don't know where to send it to.
19:37:39 <ultimateextras[m> (Obviously...)
19:37:51 <TheJollyRoger> Similarly, if your cell phone service provider doesn't know which towers to route traffic to, how are they going to deliver service to your phone?
19:37:56 <ultimateextras[m> What are you getting at?
19:38:28 <TheJollyRoger> How will your residential internet service provider know which house to run the wires to to connect the cables to, if they don't know which house is yours?
19:38:49 <TheJollyRoger> That's with respect to cellphone location.
19:39:01 <TheJollyRoger> with respect to snooping on the network, GrapheneOS considers the network to be hostile, always.
19:39:28 <TheJollyRoger> All android Apps that have been compiled and published against the version of the API established in 2008 enforce client-to-server TLS.
19:39:47 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "All android Apps that have been "> ?
19:39:56 <flawedworld[m]> <ultimateextras[m "?"> means client-server encryption
19:40:03 <flawedworld[m]> encryption in transit
19:41:06 <TheJollyRoger> Virtually all of the internet these days as well uses transport encryption, except for pages that haven't been updated since like the late 2000's?
19:41:36 <TheJollyRoger> The long story short is, all that web traffic is already encrypted and if it isn't, your browser will warn you.
19:42:06 <TheJollyRoger> The one exception, are calls and SMS messages made using the publicly switched telephone network (PSTN). Those are in plaintext. You should be using an instant messaging application like Signal which offers both transport encryption, and end to end encryption.
19:42:41 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: The defaults in GrapheneOS are safe, and may be used with confidence.
19:46:39 <TheJollyRoger> As for things like say, hiding your DNS queries, or hiding your IP address, it sounds like you're up to date on what VPNs and Tor are for.
19:47:02 <billinmtl[m]> If using Signal for SMS, there is zero encryption if the other individual is not using Signal, right ?
19:47:58 <TheJollyRoger> billinmtl[m]: yes, Signal needs both people to use Signal if you want it to be secure. Signal will warn you with "Send insecure SMS" if you're about to send plaintext SMS.
19:48:22 <hazel[m]> so GrapheneOS appears to require a domain when connecting to a WPA2-Enterprise network. how do I figure out the domain if none is provided?
19:50:01 <TheJollyRoger> hazel[m]: you'll likely have to contact your network administrator for that, unfortunately.
19:51:43 <hazel[m]> oh nevermind they specify it now
19:52:00 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
19:52:01 <Eddy[m]> hello
19:52:05 <Eddy[m]> can i ask for install support here
19:52:15 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Eddy[m], of course you may.
19:52:23 <Eddy[m]> aight
19:52:40 <TheJollyRoger> We recommend using the webinstaller, at https://grapheneos.org/install/web if you haven't already, it makes things very easy and simple. What problem are you having?
19:52:46 <ultimateextras[m> (Well, most of what I would be using (save for sideloaded software, either because I'm making something or it's too new to be there anyway) comes from F-Droid... I will be using Tor Browser at Safest (and disabling Javascript with in about:config, because issues with NoScript)(and if I can configure it without issue, Orbot for the few other things that connect to the internet on my Phone (Like F-Droid, for
19:52:46 <ultimateextras[m> example) and I'll probably just use proxychains-ng (normally I'd stick to torsocks with "-i" but it does not seem to function in Termux at the moment) in Termux whenever I decide that's a thing to be. The only thing I would really be using without Tor at all is probably Element. Should GrapheneOS configuration make it ok to work on and look up virtually anything I could typically not want to do on a smartphone?
19:52:46 <ultimateextras[m> (I know, threat models needs to be clarified... but, in general?)(Besides someone gaining access to the device by whatever means, anyway.)
19:52:47 <Eddy[m]> so ive been trying to flash graphene onto my pa4, when i tried flashing the os (after unlockign the bootloader and all
19:52:52 <Eddy[m]> the flashing is stuck
19:52:57 <Eddy[m]> im gonna try web installer
19:53:24 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: I think I know what may be the problem - if fastboot enumerates the device, and is version 31 or newer, and can lock and unlock the device,
19:53:31 <TheJollyRoger> and you're using the Google branded cable,
19:53:49 <TheJollyRoger> then this means your motherboard's firmware support for USB is incomplete or your USB port is broken.
19:53:54 <Eddy[m]> not using the google branded cable
19:54:32 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: Yep, a lot of cables lack the wiring fastboot uses to access the debugging interfaces used to talk to the phone's bootloader.
19:54:46 <TheJollyRoger> If that happens, fastboot will simply hang.
19:54:47 <ultimateextras[m> <ultimateextras[m "(Well, most of what I would be u"> TheJollyRoger:  flawedworld
19:55:03 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: please be patient, there's only so many people I can address at one time.
19:55:12 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "ultimateextras: please be patien"> Sorry...
19:56:14 <Eddy[m]> how do i even use the web intaller
19:56:17 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: I've often said this, but just use the tools as they are intended to be used, avoiding hinky homebrewing. Remember Schneier's axiom: you don't know the holes in your own system.
19:56:38 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: the web installer should explain everything on the website, please read everything before you begin, and use the Google branded cable.
19:56:42 <ultimateextras[m> <TheJollyRoger "ultimateextras: I've often said "> ?
19:56:54 <Eddy[m]> google branded cable is usb c to usb c
19:56:58 <Eddy[m]> is that an issue?
19:57:19 <nscnt[m]> Eddy: When, for what?
19:57:49 <nscnt[m]> If you miss a USB C port, sure
19:57:52 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: generally, what happens is that many cables don't have all the the proper wires. So they'll often work for transferring files and the majority of functions that most people use day-to-day, but they often won't have all the wires that fastboot needs to talk to the bootloader.
19:58:05 <TheJollyRoger> Either that, or the USB slot they're plugged into doesn't.
19:58:30 <TheJollyRoger> Or the motherboard's support for USB is the same way and doesn't have all the features that fastboot needs to do its good work and install the OS.
19:58:37 <Eddy[m]> the cable provided is usb to usb c
19:58:44 <Eddy[m]> i dont have a usb c port on my arch laptop
19:59:01 <TheJollyRoger> Symptoms of this include what I've mentioned above where your computer is able to unlock the bootloader, enumerate the device's bootloader interface, and then hangs when you try to flash.
19:59:15 <Eddy[m]> so basically
19:59:18 <Eddy[m]> try another cable
19:59:19 <Eddy[m]> right
19:59:23 <Eddy[m]> also if i wanna try falshing again
19:59:29 <Eddy[m]> do i need to re lock and unlock
19:59:33 <Eddy[m]> the bootloader or nagh
20:00:00 <Eddy[m]> also is it normal for flash-all to not have any output?
20:00:18 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: with respect to your question about "is there anything you need to configure GrapheneOS?" GrapheneOS' settings are already carefully chosen for maximum security and privacy. Any "custom tuning" you do is likely to actually erode the security gains you are getting from GrapheneOS.
20:00:48 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: if you need to try flashing again, simply try flashing a second time, there is no need to unlock and re lock, but you may find you may want to unplug your phone, wait a second, and then plug it in.
20:00:59 <Eddy[m]> ok
20:01:11 <Eddy[m]> and should flash-all have output
20:01:12 <TheJollyRoger> it is NOT normal for ./flash-all to not have any output, it means your USB cable or USB slot or the USB firmware on your motherboard is broken.
20:01:16 <Eddy[m]> to the terminal emulator
20:01:19 <Eddy[m]> ok
20:02:02 <TheJollyRoger> If you are able to get this far, but then you see that, that indicates either an insufficiently traced cable, poor USB support for your motherboard's firmware, or a broken USB connector.
20:02:16 <TheJollyRoger> So that confirms my suspicions.
20:02:17 <Eddy[m]> should the outout come out instantanouscly
20:02:31 <Eddy[m]> from the flash all command
20:02:34 <TheJollyRoger> It should take only a second or two. Let me show you what the output looks like:
20:03:09 <TheJollyRoger> https://asciinema.org/a/qVCcAFPUMheCIPejb6EwjXow4 This is the installation process done via the commandline.
20:04:01 <TheJollyRoger> ultimateextras[m: GrapheneOS has chosen its stance to be "secure and private by default." No customization, no configuration needed. Just use the phone with confidence.
20:04:12 <Eddy[m]> cable isnt working
20:04:13 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to use Tor, or a VPN, use Tor or a VPN with GrapheneOS.
20:04:13 <Eddy[m]> big sad
20:04:17 <timetravelingman> How much would grapheneOS protect my device if I took out the camera and mic and speakers and smashed the screen and threw the phone into molten lava?
20:04:43 <TheJollyRoger> timetravelingman: Well, I think you might have discovered a pretty good hardware deletion feature!
20:06:10 <Eddy[m]> there you go
20:06:17 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: It's fortunately been rare, but we have had more than one really unfortunate user that had two computers, both of which had broken USB slots.
20:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: This is not your fault and you have done nothing wrong; something that nails a lot of unfortunate people are that the vendors for both USB cables and USB ports on motherboards, as well as the motherboard vendors themselves are extremely careless and only test their stuff with a very, very, very narrow subset of devices and situations.
20:07:27 <Eddy[m]> listen
20:07:31 <Eddy[m]> i run gentoo by default
20:07:34 <Eddy[m]> hardware issues are my life
20:07:53 <TheJollyRoger> Join the club!
20:07:54 <Eddy[m]> but yeah thanks
20:07:57 <Eddy[m]> thats very reassuring
20:08:46 <TheJollyRoger> Just make sure that your version of fastboot is version 30 or newer; older versions are known for softbricking devices.
20:09:18 <Eddy[m]> just got done flashing
20:09:20 <Eddy[m]> do i reboot
20:09:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You've got a choice coming up: you can either boot the phone with the unlocked bootloader just to check it worked, then return to fastboot and lock the phone to complete your installation,
20:09:57 <TheJollyRoger> or you can hit "fastboot flashing lock" right now and reboot.
20:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> Just you need to be sure that you can see the "Your device is loading a different operating system" screen.
20:11:00 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't see that, and instead you get an orange text saying "Software Integrity Not Guaranteed" and an ominous warning about don't store private information on the device, the installation's not done and you need to lock the bootloader.
20:12:02 <TheJollyRoger> I like to test the phone by booting it once just to make sure GrapheneOS comes up before I lock, but this is a personal thing, if fastboot completed successfully you can just lock the bootloader. If it didn't work for some very bizarre reason, then you just unlock and try again.
20:12:18 <Eddy[m]> i did it
20:12:19 <Eddy[m]> now
20:12:24 <Eddy[m]> relocking thebootloader
20:12:28 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:12:33 <Eddy[m]> holy fuck the vanadium icon looks ssexy
20:12:39 <TheJollyRoger> I love it!
20:12:59 <TheJollyRoger> You're on the home stretch now! If you want, you can open up developer options again (you'll need to tap on build ID 10 times to get it to appear), then turn OEM unlocking off.
20:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> This will make it so that if someone wants to get at that OEM unlocking switch a second time, they'd need either your password/pincode, OR they'd need to get the phone into recovery and issue a factory reset first.
20:13:32 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I do love the Vanadium icon sitting on that black background.
20:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> Then turn off developer options; if you intend to use this phone day-to-day developer options should never be used and all of them should be left on their defaults.
20:14:35 <TheJollyRoger> Once you've done that, you can optionally pair with attestation server for integrity self-monitoring, and start enjoying your phone!
20:15:11 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: Welcome aboard the good ship GrapheneOS!
20:16:12 <TheJollyRoger> If you find the software useful and want to encourage our development, please send us something at https://grapheneos.org/donate - all proceeds go directly to the project, in the near future, we're hoping to hire on some developers full time or place "feature bounties" on some high-profile items.
20:18:07 <TheJollyRoger> We don't have an app store as of yet, so if you want to have one, you should be able to find either Aurora, or F-Droid, depending on your personal preferences. (Bear in mind that the version of F-Droid offered on their website is very out of date, so if you want to sideload it into other profiles, you must obtain a newer version directly from the URL, rather than from the download on their
20:18:09 <TheJollyRoger> landing page)
20:19:29 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta go for a bit, but, welcome aboard the ship matey. We set sail for security and privacy!
20:23:07 <ryan[m]> Devs thank you for your work. Keep kicking ass. I'm donating monthly and hope to contribute in the near future.
20:24:17 <TheJollyRoger> ryan[m]: on behalf of the project, thank you so much! I appreciate it and awesome to hear you are hoping to be a contributor someday, I'm hoping I might be able to do so myself.
20:50:01 <pyth0ndev[m]> Thanks for the OEM locking tip. Been using GrapheneOS for a month or so and didn't know about that.
21:39:40 <oui645> Hello, does anyone know if signal, wickr or threema work on graphene os. I remember reading somewhere signal needing google play services to correctly deliver messages?
21:44:30 <TheJollyRoger> oui645: Signal is confirmed to work on GrapheneOS. Although Signal opportunistically uses push for saving battery if play services are present, it has provisions to function without them.
21:45:09 <TheJollyRoger> oui645: Signal's developers have been *extremely* diligent in ensuring that Signal has full functionality on operating systems without Play Services and very well-optimized to function without them.
21:45:25 <TheJollyRoger> oui645: we have heard anecdotal reports in this channel of Threema working on GrapheneOS.
21:45:34 <TheJollyRoger> pyth0ndev[m]: Hey, you're welcome, glad you found it useful!
21:45:45 <donkykong[m]> <oui645 "Hello, does anyone know if signa"> Signal works well threema the notification doesn't show until you open the app
21:46:06 <TheJollyRoger> donkykong[m]: hey, thanks for the report, good to hear.
21:46:39 <oui645> thanks guys and how would one buy the threema app without play store maybe a dumb question?
21:46:57 <donkykong[m]> Threema website
21:47:12 <oui645> i will check that out thanks!
21:47:39 <donkykong[m]> Once you pay they give you a code and goes to the download page
22:07:04 <matt12543> Hello again. Trying to install GrapheneOS to a Pixel 4 from a Pixel 4 using Vanadium. I have tried several USB C/C cords and I keep getting the same "Error: No device selected" message. My host device has has USB accessories set to "allow new USB peripherials when unlocked". When I plug in the new Pixel my USB Preferences screen shows "USB
22:07:04 <matt12543> controlled by connected device, and No data transfer". I seem to be unable to change the controlled device setting or the "Use USB for" settings. Does this screen look like where my problems are at? Should a properly connected Pixel 4 show "USB controlled by This Device, and/or Use USB for File Transfer"?
22:09:18 <matt12543> Also, if I plug the same Pixel 4 and same USB C/C cord into my laptop the web installer works fine.
22:21:37 <entry1[m]> Why not just use the web installer on the laptop out of curiosity?
22:21:45 <entry1[m]> matt1254399
22:22:13 <matt1254399> I did, but I would like to be able to utilize the mobile web installer feature when traveling without a computer.
22:23:19 <matt1254399> Since it shows that GrapheneOS and Vanadium are official platforms to preform the web install I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong, or possible report a bug or something?
22:26:47 <entry1[m]> Is it just for experimenting? You only have to install the OS once on the device and then if you want a "fresh install," you can just reset the device. I wasn't personally aware of doing a web install from one Pixel to Pixel to another. I know at least as far as Linux goes, Chromium isn't recommended as it lacks key features and Chrome works.
22:28:25 <matt1254399> Officially supported operating systems for the web install method:
22:28:26 <matt1254399> Windows 10
22:28:26 <matt1254399> macOS Big Sur
22:28:27 <matt1254399> Arch Linux
22:28:27 <matt1254399> Debian 10
22:28:28 <matt1254399> Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
22:28:28 <matt1254399> Ubuntu 20.10
22:28:29 <matt1254399> ChromeOS
22:28:29 <matt1254399> GrapheneOS
22:28:30 <matt1254399> Google Android on GrapheneOS-supported devices
22:28:30 <matt1254399> Officially supported browsers for the web install method:
22:28:31 <matt1254399> Chromium (outside Ubuntu, since they ship a broken Snap package without working WebUSB)
22:28:31 <matt1254399> Vanadium (GrapheneOS)
22:28:32 <matt1254399> Google Chrome
22:28:51 <jess> i've removed that k-line
22:30:13 <matt12543> I was just kicked off for a spam flag. I was pasting the Officially supported operating systems from their website. It shows GrapheneOS and Vanadium
22:30:36 <entry1[m]> Gotcha, I was thinking of the Ubuntu package. Are you able to transfer files over from phone to phone without issue?
22:31:21 <Hardbricked> Oh great now there's imposter's now. Hmm
22:32:15 <Citizen528[m]> Are there other semi populated forums for graphene os; official or unofficial?
22:33:03 <Hardbricked> Having issues with installing Kali on grapheneos. Is this because of the arch style of graphene. What Linux distro would you recommend to run well with grapheneos.
22:39:33 <entry1[m]> <Hardbricked "Having issues with installing Ka"> You can't install an opersting system on top of GrapheneOS
22:39:50 <entry1[m]> * You can't install an operating system on top of GrapheneOS
22:40:41 <entry1[m]> <Citizen528[m] "Are there other semi populated f"> This room is bridged to include Telegram, IRC, Matrix, etc. This is the most active chat for GrapheneOS.
23:01:14 <majiru[m]> Does anyone now how I would go about customizing the font used in GrapheneOS so that I can replace some emojis? And then how I could remove some emojis from the keyboard? Any advice is appreciated.
23:06:23 <u0_a151> I have troubles connecting to a bluetooth audio device is this normal or is there something that I can do?
23:12:51 <mynacol[m]> u0_a151: Recent changes did change sth in this regard. More involved people eventually chime in.
23:13:06 <mynacol[m]> u0_a151: Were you able to connect to the same device in the past?
23:17:25 <u0_a151> never with grapheneos, it recognise it but it does not connect
23:23:47 <mynacol[m]> u0_a151: If possible stay here and wait until a knowledgeable person can diagnose what's going on.
23:24:06 <mynacol[m]> Nice nick btw.
23:26:57 <u0_a151> thanks
23:28:24 <mattin> exot
23:31:19 <xrm33[m]> Does GrapheneOs plan to become mainstream and maybe sell devices with it? That would be dope!
23:34:23 <xrm33[m]> Or at least does it plan to become focused on a regular user too?
23:42:54 <sphinx[m]> custom hardware is a long-term plan: https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400
23:45:42 <xrm33[m]> Awesome!!
23:48:23 <billinmtl[m]> <xrm33[m] "Or at least does it plan to beco"> I would consider myself a regular user - and I came to GrapheneOS because of what they offer.
23:58:41 <dazinism> Everything works fine for a regular user. Just maybe can't use some apps from Play store that you used to.
23:59:15 <dazinism> Plan is to work with a phone manufacturer to make a phone eventually
