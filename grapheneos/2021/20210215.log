00:11:17 <super_noob[m]> Hey folks. the GrapheneOS  community have a preference of f-droid  v aurora?
00:13:02 <figbert> I'm fairly new to the community, but my understanding is that Aurora Droid is just a front-end for F-Droid and thus makes no difference.
00:13:17 <figbert> Seems to just be a graphical preference to me.
00:14:00 <mr_hebi_san[m]> @figbert No, very no.
00:15:31 <figbert> mr_hebi_san[m]: ?
00:15:54 <mr_hebi_san[m]> There appears to be an Aurora Droid, but it's very different from Aurora Store, and just saying "aurora" isn't enough information to know which is being referenced
00:16:39 <akc3n[m]> <super_noob[m] "Hey folks. the GrapheneOS  commu"> I prefer FDroid for FOSS. I don't use anything that requires google play services. Aurora is just a front end for Google Play which you can access anonymously.
00:18:34 <miketanner[m]> That's great and all, but there are a LOT of great apps only available on google play
00:18:47 <miketanner[m]> imo
00:21:45 <super_noob[m]> Am I wrong to  think that a big  reason to get onto graphene is to get away from google play?
00:22:56 <akc3n[m]> <miketanner[m] "That's great and all, but there "> I'm sure there are. To each, their own.
00:23:19 <miketanner[m]> I feel like graphene is a way to get away from google play's tracking and privacy issues, while still enjoying its variety
00:27:24 <akc3n[m]> <super_noob[m] "Am I wrong to  think that a big "> Check out the first few 9 paragraphs.
00:30:00 <akc3n[m]> <miketanner[m] "I feel like graphene is a way to"> GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play services or another implementation of Google services like microG. Those are not included in the Android Open Source Project and are not required for baseline Android compatibility. Apps designed to run on Android rather than only Android with bundled Google apps and services already work on GrapheneOS, so a huge number of
00:30:00 <akc3n[m]> both open and closed source apps are already available for it.
00:55:55 <SwankyBarbecue4[> can you dual-boot stock Android and Graphene? Will that compromise my security?
00:56:08 <rny> SwankyBarbecue4[: no you cant dual-boot.
00:56:18 <SwankyBarbecue4[> thanks!
01:57:39 <noob> Hi,Â  I am trying to finish the install of GrapheneOs on Pix3, but I am stuck in fastboot.
01:58:01 <noob> Can someone guide me through?
02:00:20 <grapheneos_user_> Just follow installation guide on the website, or use the web installer, nothing we say will be any different
02:01:16 <noob> I did.Â  but I can't get out of fastboot after repeated tries.
02:01:18 <grapheneos_user_> noob: If its not working when you follow it, then explain the problem in detail
02:01:59 <akc3n[m]> <noob "Hi,Â  I am trying to finish the i"> What is displayed on your phone screen right now?
02:03:14 <noob> product revision bl......MP1.0(ROW)Â  ....... device is lockedÂ  enter reason: no valid slot to boot

02:06:13 <noob> I keep pressing the start button which is the power button and I can't exit the fastboot menu.
02:06:57 <noob> I tried the power off option on the volume buttons, but it will not power off. Bizare!
02:07:26 <TheJollyRoger> noob: what's the output of "fastboot --version"?
02:07:44 <TheJollyRoger> I think I know what you did, and this will confirm it.
02:08:18 <akc3n[m]> I don't have the experience to answer your question. Hopefully someone will be shortly that can help you out.
02:08:19 <noob> baseband version or bootloader version?
02:08:36 <noob> Or the OS version: 2021.02.07.17
02:08:39 <TheJollyRoger> noob: please post the output of the command "fastboot --version" - enter it into the terminal and press return.
02:09:59 <TheJollyRoger> You should see something like "fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874" then the location where it's running from.
02:10:20 <noob> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
02:10:20 <noob> Installed as /home/user/platform-tools/fastboot
02:10:51 <rny> noob: please use the web installer
02:11:00 <rny> TheJollyRoger: pls encourage everyone to use the web installer
02:11:16 <rny> and defer troubleshooting CLI until absolutely necessary
02:11:17 <TheJollyRoger> rny: sure, sorry about that. I was wondering if he installed with one of those third party guides and bricked his device.
02:11:18 <noob> I used the CLI way.
02:11:25 <TheJollyRoger> noob: yeah use the web installer.
02:11:31 <rny> noob: Dont use the CLI way, use the web installer.
02:11:40 <TheJollyRoger> So I wanted to find out.
02:12:07 <robotdna[m]> Has anyone here tried using Microsoft Teams on Graphene? I would try myself but don't have a Pixel at the moment. My best guess is that notifications wouldn't work.
02:12:08 <TheJollyRoger> noob: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
02:12:10 <noob> I am on Debian so I thought It would be easier.
02:12:33 <TheJollyRoger> noob: the installation is surprisingly the easiest on Windows.
02:13:19 <noob> can't afford Windows office, so I use debian.
02:14:00 <take_a_deep_brea> noob:  youll need chrome for web install
02:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> Debian includes an (ancient) version of Chromium, you should be able to use that.
02:14:23 <TheJollyRoger> Firefox isn't supported for installation via webusb.
02:14:28 <akc3n[m]> <TheJollyRoger "noob: the installation is surpri"> That's surprising. Wouldn't have thought so.
02:14:47 <noob> I used the terminal, where is the web installer?
02:15:07 <TheJollyRoger> noob: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
02:15:08 <noob> Its a minimal version of debian.
02:15:49 <TheJollyRoger> This reduces it to a very straightforward "click your way through it" process.
02:16:07 <TheJollyRoger> noob: Note that if you have private mode on, the web installer will fail.

02:18:28 <phonehome[m]> so did i lol
02:19:17 <take_a_deep_brea> noob:  youll need chrome for web install
02:19:19 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, made that mistake with +k again.
02:21:30 <noob> TheJollyRoger: I tried to use the web version but the buttons in the page don't work on firefox.Â  I would have to look to see if I have a working version of Chromium.
02:22:38 <pnrxa[m]1> TheJollyRoger: you probably want to delete their message too
02:23:52 <take_a_deep_brea> noob:  please use chrome .deb package downloaded from the wbsitw
02:23:57 <TheJollyRoger> pnrxa[m]1: Unfortunately I can't do that from the IRC side, at the moment. I need to get Element set back up again.
02:24:16 <take_a_deep_brea> debian wont have a working up to date chromium package
02:24:48 <TheJollyRoger> Oh hell, looks like the latest release is 90-something, it's like 87 in Buster.
02:24:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yikes.
02:24:58 <TheJollyRoger> Debian Busted.
02:25:03 <pnrxa[m]1> What about debian testing?
02:25:34 <TheJollyRoger> No idea.
02:25:35 <noob> I'll have restart the install.Â  I have some config stuff to do first.Â Â  Thanks for the help, I circle back tommorrow with an update.Â  Happy Vanlentine's day.
02:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> noob: fare thee well.
02:28:09 <take_a_deep_brea> well they could alternatovely visit the official chrome site and download the .deb package
02:28:10 <take_a_deep_brea> if only it had not been for matrix lag i would have managed to tell them before
02:31:32 <akc3n[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "if only it had not been for matr"> Ya I notice that quite frequently too.

02:52:27 <phonehome[m]> best valentines ever.  general tso's chicken
02:53:06 <rny> pls stay on topic
03:36:50 <MBC> What's the best way to backup and restore? Any recommendations for wireless file transfers apps (between pc <-> phone) ?
03:37:14 <TheJollyRoger> Hey MBC, the best way to back up and restore on GrapheneOS is to use SeedVault.
03:37:33 <TheJollyRoger> This will back up the apps for the owner profile only, as well as app data that the apps allow to be backed up.
03:37:35 <zzxx123> Snapdrop for wireless transfer
03:38:11 <TheJollyRoger> To find SeedVault, you'll need to go to Settings -> System -> Backup, it's included in GrapheneOS. You'll need a sheet of paper and a pen to use it, and either a NextCloud Account, or a USB drive.
03:38:37 <TheJollyRoger> It only backs up the contact list, system settings, and apps and some appdata of the owner profile though.
03:38:39 <somenerd[m]> or maybe Google Drive?
03:38:44 <somenerd[m]> think it can back it up there
03:39:48 <TheJollyRoger> I think so. You could put a Seedvault folder into a zip archive and put it on a Google Drive if you so wished.
03:40:01 <TheJollyRoger> The app data and the contact list are stored encrypted, after all.
03:40:48 <somenerd[m]> yeah, you technically shouldn't trust Google less (or more) than the nextcloud providers
03:41:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:41:40 <MBC> Hey. TheJollyRoger, Does SeedVault work on other OS's aswell?
03:42:47 <sphinxcat[m]> MBC: it must be bundled with the OS
03:42:54 <somenerd[m]> should be integrated with the OS
03:43:08 <MBC> zzxx123 thanks looks great, will try it out
03:44:34 <MBC> ah I see... looking for something which works for any custom rom in general. I guess google drive, it is then
03:45:28 <MBC> was trying to avoid google tho
03:45:31 <TheJollyRoger> MBC: I think some other operating systems bundle it, but it has to be built into the other operating system, it is not something that can be just installed as an app.
03:45:46 <TheJollyRoger> It'll work wherever you can store data. I just use an ordinary USB SSD.
03:45:54 <TheJollyRoger> that's probably the easiest way, I find.
03:46:09 <TheJollyRoger> Although you do have to remember to plug your phone into the SSD frequently.
03:46:38 <MBC> or cloud in general
03:46:40 <MBC> yeah, i see now
03:48:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:49:34 <TheJollyRoger> I've got one of those USB-A female to USB-C male cables, which I leave next to the charge plate I put my phone on at night, then I just plug it in and let it charge and back up at the same time. Seedvault will detect when you plug its USB drive in, and then automatically start the process. It's pretty convenient.
03:49:44 <MBC> wish there was something like google drive, but offline locally (between pc <-> phone only .. no remote cloud stuff)
03:56:05 <noob> So, I tried the web installer, it looks cool it recognises devices but it also told me error: unable to claim interface when I tried toÂ  open the bootloader that was already unlocked from my previous work using CLI.
03:57:14 <take_a_deep_brea> noob:  which browser ?
03:57:25 <noob> And then for every following step it told me the same message; unable to calim interface?Â Â  Chromium
03:57:36 <noob> Chromium for Debian.
03:58:25 <MBC> is there a way to know the exact build / rom image your phone originally came with if you're no longer on it? (Like from knowing date the device manufactured or something) Just remember it was Android 10 but there are 2 builds for my device a May and August one.
03:58:35 <take_a_deep_brea> try using a recent chrome https://www.google.com/chrome/
03:58:48 <take_a_deep_brea> chromium for debian is older
03:58:48 <somenerd[m]> yeah I guess use Chrome
03:58:56 <somenerd[m]> or Windows 10 Edge
03:58:56 <take_a_deep_brea> not updated
03:59:07 <somenerd[m]> those are also heavily tested
03:59:33 <noob> it was android 9, I have yet to update it.
04:01:03 <noob> You mean update chromium?Â  that will take some time, I haven't done it in a while.
04:01:25 <take_a_deep_brea> noob: no
04:01:29 <somenerd[m]> or use Chrome
04:01:40 <somenerd[m]> since debian's chromium is outdated apparently
04:01:46 <somenerd[m]> > chromium for debian is older
04:01:59 <take_a_deep_brea> go to that site and download chrome , as that package you are using most likely didnt receiev any updates
04:02:07 <take_a_deep_brea> <take_a_deep_brea "try using a recent chrome https:"> .
04:02:16 <noob> sorry, it's chrome not chromium that I am using.
04:02:34 <take_a_deep_brea> did you install it as apt install ----
04:03:10 <noob> I went to the google website and installed it with command lines a few months ago.
04:03:19 <take_a_deep_brea> ok good
04:03:56 <take_a_deep_brea> it can update itself
04:04:05 <take_a_deep_brea> just check wether its upto date
04:04:48 <noob> Nope, I turned off the updates.Â  I'm funny that way. Updates a tricky thing with my distribution.
04:05:14 <take_a_deep_brea> alsu yoou need udev rules on linux for the browser to be able to use the USB interface
04:05:40 <take_a_deep_brea> and do please enable updates on chrome as it gets security critical updates , lmao
04:06:04 <take_a_deep_brea> but yeah i understand the thing with debian
04:06:26 <noob> I installed udev rules them before I pluged in the phone.
04:06:36 <take_a_deep_brea> ok great .
04:07:14 <take_a_deep_brea> then it just maybe an outdated browser issue
04:07:22 <noob> MY phone is stuck in fastboot and I can't seem to get out of it.Â  Would you believe I have Graphene installed but it doesn't seem to work.
04:07:32 <noob> could be.
04:08:17 <noob> Version 87.0.4280.88 (Official Build) (64-bit)
04:09:36 <take_a_deep_brea> thats good enough actually
04:10:16 <noob> I must have damaged something for it not work in the web installer version.
04:10:35 <take_a_deep_brea> well it maybe a hw issue .
04:10:38 <noob> I looked at how to exit from fastboot and I can't do it.
04:10:59 <take_a_deep_brea> how come ?
04:12:35 <noob> The device is not responding.Â  It's unlocked, in fastboot but can be managed by the web installer. i.e. the web installer can't acess an interface?
04:15:43 <rny> noobna[m]: reboot it
04:16:13 <rny> NewtoGraphene: reboot it
04:16:56 <take_a_deep_brea> oh yeah
04:17:02 <NewtoGraphene> rny[m] can't do that either, only options: start, turn off, recovery mode, restart bootloader, rescue mode.
04:17:39 <take_a_deep_brea> i think he meant the system from which you are flashing
04:19:21 <NewtoGraphene> I just refreshed the web page and reconnected the phone and got: unable to claim interface.
04:19:39 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  you need to reboot the system
04:20:01 <take_a_deep_brea> start fresh
04:20:16 <NewtoGraphene> The laptop? or my debian distribution?
04:21:12 <take_a_deep_brea> the laptop .
04:21:45 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont understand what you meant by "the laptop OR the debian distribution"
04:22:25 <somenerd[m]> are you on a VM?
04:22:36 <NewtoGraphene> I asked the question because, I can't restart the phone.Â  It's stuck.
04:22:41 <somenerd[m]> VM passthrough is scuffed
04:22:57 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  its ok
04:23:05 <NewtoGraphene> Oooooops. D:
04:23:10 <take_a_deep_brea> just reboot the system you are using to install graphene
04:23:14 <take_a_deep_brea> not the pixe;
04:23:17 <take_a_deep_brea> *pixe;
04:23:24 <take_a_deep_brea>  * *pixel
04:23:38 <take_a_deep_brea> and please dont use a VM
04:23:51 <take_a_deep_brea> i too am getting the impression that you are using a VM
04:23:59 <somenerd[m]> yeah seriously don't
04:24:13 <somenerd[m]> passthrough isn't exactly reliable
04:24:41 <NewtoGraphene> I noticed that as well.
04:25:00 <rny> NewtoGraphene: reboot the phone
04:25:23 <rny> Turn Off and then turn it on again
04:25:31 <rny> or restart bootloader
04:25:43 <rny> then use the web installer again
04:25:52 <rny> if it fails, try with another USB cable
04:26:12 <NewtoGraphene> I get the no command answer and the little guy is on his back message.
04:27:27 <NewtoGraphene> If a usb c and 1 cable came with the phone, I might not have this issue.
04:27:41 <strcat[m]> that's recovery not the bootloader interface
04:27:53 <strcat[m]> you're not holding volume down when it powers on
04:30:54 <NewtoGraphene> it's in fastboot mode.
04:31:10 <NewtoGraphene> at least that's what it says.
04:32:00 <take_a_deep_brea> does it say fastbootd?
04:32:06 <strcat[m]> NewtoGraphene: you need to be in the *bootloader interface*
04:32:09 <strcat[m]> follow what the guide says
04:32:12 <strcat[m]> whatever you're doing is wrong
04:32:33 <take_a_deep_brea> <take_a_deep_brea "does it say fastbootd?"> then thats the recovery
04:32:37 <NewtoGraphene> Yes, it say fastboot mode with a little red triangle.
04:36:36 <NewtoGraphene> Now, I am getting access denied and device must be open first. ?Â Â  it's been open, it has a version of graphene from the cli install.Â  Unfortunately, it's not working yet and I can't get out of the fastboot.
04:37:09 <rny> have you unlocked the bootloader?
04:37:36 <take_a_deep_brea> they said a red triangle was shown so i assume yes
04:37:50 <NewtoGraphene> Device state is unlocked.
04:38:04 <rny> no where in this process a message prints and say "device must be open first"
04:38:07 <rny> wtf even is that
04:38:52 <take_a_deep_brea> i think they have not worded their query properly
04:41:59 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  please dont assume that a previous graphene image flashed is of any relevance here .
04:44:14 <NewtoGraphene> rny[m] dont what it is either.Â Â Â Â  take_a_deep_breaÂ  I am not, I am making an observation of the process I took to install it under CLI.
04:44:33 <take_a_deep_brea> ok
04:45:07 <take_a_deep_brea> mind posting a screenshot of that message if you havent closed the window ?
04:45:55 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_breaÂ  has anyone ever let the batery run out and see if a phone will turn on and exit fastboot?
04:46:23 <rny> NewtoGraphene: cant you reboot the phone?
04:46:56 <NewtoGraphene> rny It's stuck.
04:47:08 <rny> power + volume down long press
04:47:17 <rny> until it reboots into bootloader mode again
04:47:41 <rny> detach cable
04:49:47 <NewtoGraphene> @rny: It doesn't seem to want to get out of fastboot.
04:55:07 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_brea: i would if I could copy paste.Â  Again, a VM issue.
04:55:38 <NewtoGraphene> I just can't seem to figure out how to attach an image file to the chat.
04:58:02 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  well , you shouldnt be using a VM in the first place . by the way which is the host OS?
04:58:31 <NewtoGraphene> Debian .
04:59:07 <take_a_deep_brea> well sorry , and which VM are you running?
04:59:23 <NewtoGraphene> Virtual
04:59:31 <NewtoGraphene> Virtualbox .
04:59:49 <take_a_deep_brea> nah, which OS ?
05:00:05 <NewtoGraphene> It's all linux.
05:00:28 <take_a_deep_brea> its not relevant as you should be doing  installation from OS running on baremetal
05:01:17 <take_a_deep_brea> i mean i was the one who asked so sorry for that , but please use the host debian
05:01:18 <NewtoGraphene> Baremetal.Â  hummm.Â  looks you know.
05:01:39 <somenerd[m]> yeah should've used the host
05:01:48 <take_a_deep_brea> by bare metal i simply meant not virtualized
05:03:00 <NewtoGraphene> I am noob, just trying to best tools out there to protect my privacy.
05:05:12 <NewtoGraphene> trying to use the best tools to protect my devices.
05:05:24 <take_a_deep_brea> well its alright
05:05:40 <take_a_deep_brea> just use the debian host system please dont use virtualbox
05:05:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Pretty interesting results from trying to influence the FB knowledge base.  Spent a lot of time in a clean empty User profile with Insta installed, teaching it that I must really like something that real me has no interest in.  Insta is pretty convinced that I've had a sudden new interest.
05:05:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Doesn't seem to have leaked out to ads on the web.  Even on the same user profile.  Wasn't expecting this.  Proably because I am not logged into any FB property in any browser on any profile on that phone
05:06:27 <take_a_deep_brea> if you have chrome installed and updated , its ok . otherwise install chrome on the host debian system from the chrome official sitwe
05:08:38 <take_a_deep_brea> make sure you have android-sdk-platform-tools-common installed on host system
05:08:39 <NewtoGraphene> 6 degree's of separation.
05:09:14 <take_a_deep_brea> well , whats that ?
05:09:23 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_brea: I did that already.Â  I'll do again in the terminal.
05:09:58 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  upto you which method works for you. no reason web installer wont work on the host
05:10:20 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_brea: We all know each other by 6 degrees of separation.Â  each degree is a person that knows a person.
05:12:18 <take_a_deep_brea> well you are responding to mr_hebi_san's comment . he is in the #grapheneos-offtopic room if you want to pursue a discussion about that .
05:12:54 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Yeah I moved my comment to OT because I derped and posted it here by accident
05:14:06 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_brea: Sorry about my observation.
05:14:29 <take_a_deep_brea> no its ok
05:15:26 <NewtoGraphene> I just want to get this mobile OS working.Â  I specifically did not update it because I didn't want to affect the firmware when I do a auditor check.
05:15:47 <somenerd[m]> it shouldn't affect auditor
05:16:01 <take_a_deep_brea> well that is not the way things work
05:16:20 <somenerd[m]> you should update it
05:16:29 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  what didnt youupdate ?
05:16:29 <somenerd[m]> it's signed with the same key anyways
05:16:34 <NewtoGraphene> Yes, but in the documention they mention to cautious as the first audit is the most important.
05:16:41 <take_a_deep_brea> the pixel device or debian ?
05:16:53 <NewtoGraphene> The pixel device.
05:17:21 <somenerd[m]> > Yes, but in the documention they mention to cautious as the first audit is the most important.
05:17:21 <somenerd[m]> so?
05:17:25 <take_a_deep_brea> well the pixel device needs to be updated
05:17:33 <somenerd[m]> the installation is important
05:17:44 <somenerd[m]> not the version
05:17:56 <rny> NewtoGraphene: if you must, let battery drain till it switches off, then repeat the process
05:18:06 <NewtoGraphene> Yes, I've had situations where the firmware was changed.
05:18:18 <somenerd[m]> the firmware key?
05:18:28 <NewtoGraphene> @rny: I might just try that.
05:18:29 <rny> to everyone else, pls take it to offtopic
05:18:34 <take_a_deep_brea> you may be facing issues because of not updating the pixel
05:19:31 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_brea: That might be the issue as well.
05:19:55 <take_a_deep_brea> i am myself not sure thats why i deleted that comment
05:20:22 <take_a_deep_brea> thing is you certainly need to reboot the phone and then use the host system for installation
05:20:33 <rny> the web installer takes care of these things
05:20:37 <take_a_deep_brea> also which pixel device is this ?
05:20:43 <NewtoGraphene> 3
05:20:54 <rny> NewtoGraphene: when you restart tomorrow, flash stock, update, then use the web installer to install grapheneos
05:20:59 <rny> no vm shenenigans pls.
05:21:10 <NewtoGraphene> 3a . lol
05:21:34 <NewtoGraphene> A little malarky always helps.
05:22:57 <take_a_deep_brea> NewtoGraphene:  install up to date chrome on host debian system . and also android-sdk-platform-tools-common . that should work fine . else go for cli . and please do not read between the lines in the installation guide
05:23:06 <take_a_deep_brea> just follow it and you will be fine
05:23:19 <take_a_deep_brea>  * NewtoGraphene:  install up to date chrome on host debian system . and also android-sdk-platform-tools-common . that should work fine . else go for cli . and please do not read between the lines in the installation guide or elsewhere in the documentation
05:23:32 <take_a_deep_brea> if you have any issues we will be around
05:23:38 <NewtoGraphene> I just wanted to say thank for your assitance tonight.Â  Have a great eveining, day, or afternoon.
05:24:08 <take_a_deep_brea> good night to you !
05:24:20 <NewtoGraphene> take_a_deep_brea: thanks, and likewise.
05:37:03 <cx7dd[m]> strcat m2tu  Thanks for your responses. I figured it now out. One has to remove out/ before doing "source script/envsetup.sh"
05:37:03 <cx7dd[m]> Then you get the correct build number set up. Maybe this can be mentoined in the "Building" section in the Build-guide.
05:37:33 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: it is
05:38:04 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#building
05:38:17 <strcat[m]> > For production builds, you should remove the remnants of any past builds before starting, particularly if there were non-trivial changes:
05:38:26 <strcat[m]> `rm -r out`
05:39:16 <strcat[m]> you can change the build number for an incremental build but that rarely makes sense and it isn't truly a new build
05:55:29 <cx7dd[m]> Yes but when I get to this step I already did "source script/envsetup". And then deleting the /out directory didnt updated the build_number for me.
05:55:58 <strcat[m]> because build date / build number are set in your shell environment
05:57:28 <cx7dd[m]> I didnt knew that.
06:01:17 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "brenneke: if you want to update "> Thank you Jolly.
06:05:49 <somenerd[m]> > brenneke: if you want to update Auditor, you can download it direct from Github, actually. That's the recommended way. It's signed and verifiedand preauthenticated: GrapheneOS will not allow you to install counterfeit versions of Auditor.
06:05:49 <somenerd[m]> that's a very cool feature
06:06:50 <somenerd[m]> but makes sense
06:07:58 <somenerd[m]> as it's bundled with the OS
06:10:07 <strcat[m]> it applies to any installed app
06:10:34 <strcat[m]> the OS package manager always verifies app signatures and enforces pinning / authorized key rotations
06:10:37 <somenerd[m]> so it doesn't work if you uninstall it?
06:10:39 <strcat[m]> and downgrade protection based on versionCode
06:10:50 <strcat[m]> you can't uninstall it
06:10:53 <strcat[m]> it's a system app
06:10:55 <somenerd[m]> (like uninstall auditor and then reinstall a malicious ver.....)
06:11:09 <strcat[m]> nothing about it is specific to Auditor or GrapheneOS
06:11:10 <somenerd[m]> > it's a system app
06:11:10 <somenerd[m]> should actually use GrapheneOS before asking these things
06:11:19 <somenerd[m]> and read the AOSP docs
06:11:27 * somenerd[m] goes to read the docs
06:14:30 <somenerd[m]> > nothing about it is specific to Auditor or GrapheneOS
06:14:30 <somenerd[m]> yeah since Auditor is a system app, it can't be uninstalled
06:14:40 <somenerd[m]> and AOSP enforces verification of the hash
06:14:47 <somenerd[m]>  * and AOSP enforces verification of the hash/signature
06:18:48 <somenerd[m]> > nothing about it is specific to Auditor or GrapheneOS
06:18:48 <somenerd[m]> yeah forgot that signature verification exists
06:22:01 <sphinxcat[m]> brenneke:
06:22:01 <sphinxcat[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1361183090123681793 btw
07:06:43 <eenno[m]> I've been scrolling through this chat for a bit and searched but couldn't find if someone already asked. But what's in the OTA for Pixel 2/XL? I can see that the link to the build is there on the website, but there is no change log explaining what's changed.
07:10:18 <lucaszanella[m]> Anyone tried to run the emulator by specifying the .imgs by hand? If you do `./emulator -sysdir $DIR_OUT/system -datadir $DIR_OUT/data -kernel ${AOSP_ROOT}/prebuilts/qemu-kernel/x86_64/5.4/kernel-qemu2 -ramdisk $DIR_OUT/ramdisk-qemu.img -system $DIR_OUT/system-qemu.img -data $DIR_OUT/userdata-qemu.img -cache $DIR_OUT/cache.img -vendor $DIR_OUT/vendor-qemu.img` WITHOUT doing source build/envsetup.sh, it won't work.
07:10:18 <lucaszanella[m]> I'm trying to launch GrapheneOS by hand using the emulator prebuilt. Already opened a bug on google but they didn't answer. I even found the reason of the error (at least one of them). I did a workaround but it won't boot either. (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/180021379)
07:12:03 <lucaszanella[m]> Basically android emulator tries to find system.img inside the -sysdir instead of in the path I specified. Then the emulator tries to create a string from this path, but it is NULL since there is no system.img inside -sysdir so it segfaults. Putting system.img inside -sysdir fixes the segfault but emulator launches black and wont boot and also it thinks I'm trying to run a non x86 image, which is not true
07:23:50 <slkasdlkf> Can I root my phone if I use GrapheneOS?
07:24:00 <take_a_deep_brea> no
07:25:04 <take_a_deep_brea> this is not the right place to discuss the possibility of rooting modding graphene OS
07:25:40 <take_a_deep_brea> as its considered as aregression in terms of OS security
07:25:56 <take_a_deep_brea>  * its i considered aregression in terms of OS security
07:26:03 <take_a_deep_brea>  * its is considered aregression in terms of OS security
07:26:15 <take_a_deep_brea>  * its is considered aregression in  OS security
07:27:04 <take_a_deep_brea> slkasdlkf: please lets not discuss this here for the above reasons and do you mind deleting that comment so that other newcomers dont get the wrong idea ?
07:27:41 <take_a_deep_brea> you can PM me if you like and i will answer your questions
07:27:52 <take_a_deep_brea> in regard to this
07:29:29 <strcat[m]> slkasdlkf: no, GrapheneOS doesn't support that, if you make a derivative of the OS with stuff like that it wouldn't be GrapheneOS anymore and it'd be very counter to the purpose of it
07:29:49 <strcat[m]> support for derivatives of the OS is off-topic for the channel
07:30:43 <slkasdlkf> Thanks
07:51:25 <NonServiam> Is there a way of locking your phone that is most secure and/or private? Pin, password, patterns, fingerprints, etc?
07:51:36 <NonServiam> Not sure which one I should pick and use.
07:57:06 <take_a_deep_brea> NonServiam:  password also this may help further https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
08:06:56 <NonServiam> Thanks, lots of info there.
08:20:08 <sierocharlie[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I've got one of those USB-A fema"> How are you charging and backing up to a USB at the same time?
08:30:23 <timeo[m]> I had a question about receiving a silent SMS
08:31:03 <timeo[m]> Can it happen if airplane mode is enabled?
08:33:43 <strcat[m]> @sierocharlie: wireless charging
08:33:50 <mynacol[m]> timeo: I recommend reading the following section https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
08:34:09 <sierocharlie[m]> <strcat[m] "@sierocharlie: wireless charging"> Right, hadn't thought about that one! Especially since my Pixel doesn't charge wirelessly
08:34:35 <sierocharlie[m]> How do you guys charge btw? I charge it to 80% every day and keep it above 30%.
08:35:49 <take_a_deep_brea> i too have been wondering about best practices in this regard
08:36:20 <timeo[m]> <mynacol[m] "timeo: I recommend reading the f"> I already read that but i wasn't 100% sure if it can happen with airplane on
08:36:32 <mynacol[m]> @sierocharlie: TheJollyRoger posted something interesting some days ago. Smartphone have become smarter, so charging to 100% and leaving it plugged in will actually be good for the device
08:36:57 <mynacol[m]> timeo: Re-read it. There is a paragraph explaining it
08:37:11 <sierocharlie[m]> I will try and find his message, I must've missed it. Was it here or on off-topic?
08:38:49 <mynacol[m]> Found it: https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7106961?hl=en&ref_topic=9153326
08:41:09 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks. Is the adaptive charging part actually implemented in Graphene, or in AOSP?
08:42:14 <mynacol[m]> @sierocharlie: If its in AOSP, it is in Graphene. If it is _not_ in AOSP (but stock) it probably isn't in Graphene.
08:43:18 <take_a_deep_brea> a nice summary
08:43:48 <sierocharlie[m]> Yeah, that's why I am asking if it's in AOSP. Can't find it at hindsight whether it's there or not.
08:45:37 <sierocharlie[m]> It doesn't have the option in the battery settings, I am assuming it doesn't which means a large part of it becoming smarter doesn't apply to graphene.
08:46:01 <strcat[m]> we don't have that feature
08:46:06 <strcat[m]> we do have all the standard stuff
08:46:18 <strcat[m]> i.e. the battery and USB controller throttle charging based on heat, etc.
08:46:28 <strcat[m]> and it slows it down when it's nearing full capacity
08:46:38 <strcat[m]> that's standard for the SoC / battery
08:47:00 <sierocharlie[m]> Yeah, but how do you charge it? What is the best way of charging in order to prolong battery life.
08:47:39 <strcat[m]> not much you can do to impact that
08:47:41 <strcat[m]> just charge it
08:47:47 <mynacol[m]> That was the conversation with JR: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210201#c6749097
08:47:54 <strcat[m]> it slows down charging as it gets near full capacity already
08:48:17 <strcat[m]> the adaptive charging feature isn't in AOSP, it's part of Play Services combined with the added Google apps, etc. on Pixels
08:48:25 <strcat[m]> that feature isn't related to the baseline charging
08:48:36 <strcat[m]> rather it sometimes disables fast charging because it guesses you don't need it
08:49:02 <strcat[m]> if you explicitly don't want fast charging you can connect it via a USB A to C port to a computer
08:49:41 <strcat[m]> or use a baseline USB charger that doesn't support fast charging
08:50:13 <strcat[m]> there is no point in not charging it though, it already slows down charging itself as it gets more full, that isn't 'adaptive charging', that's how fast charging works
08:51:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> @sierocharlie: best way just keep it plugged in all the time
08:51:58 <sierocharlie[m]> And keep it above 30%
08:52:11 <sierocharlie[m]> So just fully charge it once a day to 100%
08:53:59 <Dylanger[m]> Huh, I didn't know Google Services had a charging 'thing', I've only ever looked at Qualcomm QuickCharge and USB PD
08:54:23 <mynacol[m]> It's just USB PD
08:54:35 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah
08:57:03 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it isn't really a special form of charging
08:57:26 <strcat[m]> it just overrides the high level charging approach in some cases
08:57:34 <strcat[m]> it's not an alternate implementation of fast charging
08:57:52 <Dylanger[m]> Sounds like Google trying add "value"
08:58:03 <strcat[m]> it does pretty much what they say there
08:58:10 <strcat[m]> if can detect you went to sleep
08:58:19 <strcat[m]> and that you probably don't need fast charging
08:58:28 <strcat[m]> better hope an emergency doesn't happen where you have to wake up and need a charged phone
08:58:34 <strcat[m]>  * better hope an emergency doesn't happen where you have to wake up early and need a charged phone
08:58:39 <Dylanger[m]> Damn
08:58:45 <take_a_deep_brea> weird shit
08:58:47 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: you can disable it though
08:58:49 <strcat[m]> it's a toggle
08:59:08 <strcat[m]> they have adaptive brightness, adaptive charging, etc. where they use some basic machine learning (it's nothing complex) to learn what you want
08:59:15 <strcat[m]> can all be toggled off to use the AOSP approach
08:59:30 <strcat[m]> I personally don't think any of that stuff is desirable anyway
08:59:34 <strcat[m]> better for things to be simple and predictable
08:59:34 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
08:59:48 <strcat[m]> instead of it trying to guess how bright you want the screen based on what app you're using, time of day, and so on
09:00:13 <sierocharlie[m]> Actually research shows that charging lithium-ion batteries to 100% can halve the lifespan of the battery according to what I am reading.
09:00:14 <somenerd[m]> would be bad if it randomly increases the brightness
09:00:17 <strcat[m]> the simple approach of basing it on the lighting (auto brightness) works fine
09:01:43 <take_a_deep_brea> @sierocharlie: the battery firmware is designed with those considerations in mind
09:11:31 <sierocharlie[m]> Oh okay.
09:11:44 <sierocharlie[m]> Do you have a source for that btw? Not that I don't take your word for it, just like to read more on it.
09:13:44 <Dylanger[m]> lol
09:18:05 * lezogeek[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/OPqDedWuveaZDbTxkaFxXONn/message.txt >
09:18:33 <sierocharlie[m]> Are you by any chance inside?
09:21:14 <take_a_deep_brea> <sierocharlie[m] "Do you have a source for that bt"> well you certainly shouldnt take my word for it . but what i said was more of a personal observation considering that power optimization was always a priority with smartphones
09:23:36 <strcat[m]> lezogeek: it takes time to get a GPS lock
09:23:44 <strcat[m]> you can use SatStat to get more information about it
09:24:06 <sierocharlie[m]> Not only that, inside you often cannot get a GPS lock.
09:24:27 <somenerd[m]> > you can use SatStat to get more information about it
09:24:27 <somenerd[m]> think that Wi-Fi and other features are also used
09:24:29 <sierocharlie[m]> Some people are used to their location being shown inside, but that's just because Gmaps uses wifi SSID's to locate you when no GPS fix is available.
09:32:29 <sierocharlie[m]> I suggest reading this. https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries
09:32:54 <sierocharlie[m]> The research actually shows not charging to 100% will improve battery life.
09:34:02 <sierocharlie[m]> The depth of discharge is also very important. Partial discharges reduce stress and prolong battery life.
09:34:02 <sierocharlie[m]> I.e. you should recharge often when possible. Rather than allowing for a deeper discharge.
09:35:36 * cx7dd[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/siSjRfEbWznXrUvloWzJxjtk/message.txt >

09:37:12 <lezogeek[m]> Here what satstat says
09:37:33 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: sounds like you are building with the same build number
09:37:50 <strcat[m]> lezogeek: are you outside?
09:37:53 <sierocharlie[m]> <lezogeek[m] "Screenshot_20210215-103602.png"> Again: Are you inside or outside?
09:38:26 <sierocharlie[m]> Your phone simply does not get a GPS fix a lot of the times when inside.
09:38:42 <strcat[m]> or at least in a small house made of wood or something, not some big concrete building
09:39:54 <cx7dd[m]> <strcat[m] "cx7dd: sounds like you are build"> I did repo init -u... -b refs/tags/RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.07.17
09:40:19 <lezogeek[m]> Yes I'm Inside but i can try outside
09:40:24 <strcat[m]> lezogeek: GrapheneOS has GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, etc.) for location detection without supplementary network-based location services like Google Android and iOS where it feeds nearby cell towers / Wi-Fi network SSIDs with their signal strength to a server to fetch approximations of location info
09:40:31 <strcat[m]> you should expect to need to be outside to use GPS
09:40:38 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: that has little to do with it
09:41:03 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: if you build from an existing build, the build number will always be the same unless you explicitly override it
09:41:09 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: if you have a build number set in your shell environment, that will override it
09:41:20 <strcat[m]> cx7dd: if you do a fresh build, without setting a specific build number, in a clean environment
09:41:26 <strcat[m]> then you get a new build number every time
09:41:40 <strcat[m]> build number is the ID of your build based on date when you set up the environment for your build
09:41:44 <strcat[m]> it is NOT based on the source code
09:41:56 <strcat[m]> if you're getting the same build number for a new build, it's because you're reusing the same build environment
09:42:20 <strcat[m]> you can check the build number in `out/soong/build_number.txt`
09:42:43 <strcat[m]> if that's the same as previous builds it's because you are *not* clearing the output directory or *not* making a clean shell without `BUILD_NUMBER` set in it
09:42:58 <cx7dd[m]> I managed to get a new build number this time.
09:42:59 <cx7dd[m]> I removed out/ and then startet the guide from the top. I got a build with the current date. That worked so far.
09:44:39 <cx7dd[m]> Is there maybe something else I need to remove? For example everything except .repo?
09:47:17 <cx7dd[m]> <strcat[m] "you can check the build number i"> out/soong/build_number.txt contains the current date
09:49:44 <cx7dd[m]> But the update did apply. At least partly. For example I didnt include the updater and after the ota-sideload it's gone.
09:49:44 <cx7dd[m]> Is there a way to know which version of the source-code is checked out?
09:54:45 <strcat[m]> there's no way for it to partly apply
09:55:00 <strcat[m]> you've got the wrong idea about how it works
09:56:32 <owcnthe2947[m]> Hello, any chance we might get a graphene template for Qubes? I head it was at one point planned.
09:58:07 <cx7dd[m]> <strcat[m] "you've got the wrong idea about "> Ok, I have to admit I'm new to building android.
09:58:29 <strcat[m]> the build number isn't set in the source tree
09:58:50 <strcat[m]> it's determined when setting up the build environment along with build date
09:59:08 <strcat[m]> if you reuse the build environment (shell or the same output directory) then you're reusing the same build setup
09:59:12 <strcat[m]> that doesn't come from the sources
09:59:50 <strcat[m]> you can also choose to set those manually but you probably don't want that
10:03:24 <Blackbeard> Hi.
10:04:09 <take_a_deep_brea> hey
10:12:03 <cx7dd[m]> @strcat:matrix.org  I'll create a complete new directory and just copy the .repo - maybe this works.
10:12:03 <cx7dd[m]> Thanks for your patience.
10:12:24 <strcat[m]> really don't need to do that
10:12:31 <strcat[m]> you can use `repo status` to check the status of the git repos
10:12:43 <strcat[m]> I think the issue is you were reusing `out/` and then perhaps reusing a shell after you had cleared it
10:12:51 <strcat[m]> build number / build date are not based on the source tree
10:12:56 <strcat[m]> but nevermind, don't want to talk about it further
10:14:45 <cx7dd[m]> I did this mistake yesterday.
10:14:46 <cx7dd[m]> But today I removed /out then started a new terminal. And did script/envsetup.
10:14:46 <cx7dd[m]> Then $BUILD_DATETIME and $BUILD_NUMBER were correct.
10:24:34 <lezogeek[m]> <lezogeek[m] "Yes I'm Inside but i can try out"> Worked outside but never worked before. Will see
11:41:08 <somenerd[m]> >Is there a setting for erase on x pin attempts?

17:21:40 <spartaniz> The apps are FNB (banking app), Bitfinex, Binance, Luno, IG trading, tradingview and Easy Equities.
17:21:58 <spartaniz> If anyone could provide assistance, I would be grateful
17:23:23 <spartaniz> Iâ€™ve made a post on reddit about this and got a reply referring me to this

18:03:55 <serpantsauce[m]> Has anyone compiled a list of providers which work or don't work well with Graphene? I'm thinking of getting a Pixel 4a for Graphene and using a prepaid plan from Freedom Mobile but I'm worried I'll run into an issue with getting service.
18:04:52 <codebam> grapheneos on the pixel 5 is working great. just a few things I noticed. volume controls aren't lined up with the volume rocker, dark mode isn't black
18:04:58 <codebam> I really like that I can disable network as an app permission
18:05:17 <codebam> my favorite thing about grapheneos by far
18:06:29 <codebam> oh and gcam
18:06:45 <codebam> it would be nice if I could install gcam because I can't fully utilize the cameras
18:06:57 <Blackbeard> are other devices on the horizon?
18:07:02 <codebam> I tried the apk but it doesn't get past the camera icon splash screen
18:07:30 <somenerd[m]> > are other devices on the horizon?
18:07:30 <somenerd[m]> well, for other devices to be supported, they have to meet the security requirements imposed by GrapheneOS
18:07:38 <somenerd[m]> and there has to be maintainers for the devices
18:09:15 <serpantsauce[m]> > Has anyone compiled a list of providers which work or don't work well with Graphene? I'm thinking of getting a Pixel 4a for Graphene and using a prepaid plan from Freedom Mobile but I'm worried I'll run into an issue with getting service.

18:10:20 <codebam> gets stuck here. so I think maybe that's an issue with accessing all of the different cameras?
18:11:09 <codebam> I'll see if I can grab a logcat
18:16:20 <codebam> oh according to the logcat it looks like gcam requires gsf.gservices
18:17:29 <take_a_deep_brea> Sean:  the issue with gcam is not a matter of grapheneos support its the problem with it having dependence on play services
18:17:29 <take_a_deep_brea> datk mode was neve absolute black in the first place
18:17:42 <codebam> is there a modded gcam that doesn't require that by chance?
18:17:51 <codebam> dark mode is black on stock for the pixels
18:20:50 <take_a_deep_brea> Sean:  well i wasnt aware of that , regarding dark mode
18:22:11 <codebam> I don't really mind, just something I noticed when I switched from stock
18:22:12 <take_a_deep_brea> and yes , lukaspieper on github has a non intrusive app wjich allows specific versions of gcam to work

18:38:29 <codebam> I use eSIM too. just enable D2DS

18:39:07 <serpantsauce[m]> <codebam "I use freedom mobile. works fine"> Awesome. I'm looking at getting a prepaid plan but I have to figure out exactly how that works.
18:39:38 <codebam> I'm not sure about that. You could contact their twitter support maybe?

19:48:11 <Larissa1625375> hi
19:53:40 <morepheus_x[m]> Can't really donate, but if you pre-install Graphene onto phones, I could help with the shipping of the devices.
19:59:17 <shibboleth> does graphene include/bundle a terminal application? is it possible to run commands with root privs?
20:21:48 <codebam> <shibboleth "does graphene include/bundle a t"> no, yes but you need to flash magisk
20:21:57 <codebam> depending on what you need, termux is quite good
20:28:46 <shibboleth> what does that mean? there is no first-party su and magisk is required?
20:29:30 <shibboleth> magisk, which looking at the web page looks kinda shady?
20:31:35 <shibboleth> that is, i get a headache looking at it
20:33:25 <shibboleth> ah, magiskroot.com looked less like an ad for vitamins than magiskroots.com
20:34:13 <shibboleth> anyway... mind me asking five questions re graphene basics?
20:35:55 <shibboleth> 1: looks like grapheneos rules out using twrp. correct? does grapheneos offer a recovery with similar functionality?
20:36:40 <shibboleth> 2: no root/su. how configurable is the firewall? is it all possible to do anything as root, say adb?
20:37:11 <akc3n[m]> shibboleth GrapheneOS does not support root. All instances of GrapheneOS are signed and verified. Derivatives of GrapheneOS with Magisk or something like that are off-topic.
20:37:18 <shibboleth> 3: bluetooth/wifi mac address. can these be specified/changed by the user?
20:37:23 <akc3n[m]> * @shibboleth GrapheneOS does not support root. All instances of GrapheneOS are signed and verified. Derivatives of GrapheneOS with Magisk or something like that are off-topic.
20:37:58 <shibboleth> yeah, i wasn't the one one to mention magisk
20:38:20 <akc3n[m]> * shibboleth  GrapheneOS does not support root. All instances of GrapheneOS are signed and verified. Derivatives of GrapheneOS with Magisk or something like that are off-topic.
20:38:23 <shibboleth> yeah, i wasn't the one one to mention magisk
20:39:10 <codebam> is it possible to get chromecast working?
20:41:12 <akc3n[m]> Are the one that mentioned rooting though shibboleth
20:41:28 <shibboleth> i asked a question
20:41:53 <shibboleth> and then moved on to three others
20:57:50 <akc3n[m]> * You are the one that mentioned rooting though shibboleth
20:58:25 <akc3n[m]> * You are the one that mentioned rooting though @shibboleth
20:58:35 <shibboleth> i asked a question. may i ask that we move on to the tree other questions i had?
21:25:58 <m2tu[m]> can data be recovered back if the phone gets wiped from hardreset ?
21:28:19 <sphinxcat[m]> <codebam "is it possible to get chromecast"> I think VLC supports it.
21:32:52 <codebam> <sphinxcat[m] "I think VLC supports it."> I'll try that. thanks
21:35:42 <skwisgaar[m]> shibboleth: if youâ€™re looking to have that much control over your device, then grapheneos will not be a good solution for you.
21:35:56 <sphinxcat[m]> shibboleth: recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#firewall and https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
21:36:12 <shibboleth> yes, i read those. says nothing of the bluetooth mac
21:36:15 <shibboleth> hence me asking
21:37:57 <shibboleth> so my questions boild down to these: a: can the firewall be configured to block specific applications from being able to use specific connections (and can system services be blocked), b: can both wifi and bluetooth mac be changed/randomized?
21:40:14 <skwisgaar[m]> You definitely cannot change the bluetooth mac yourself, but bluetooth on graphene is already very private. Wifi mac is random by default, that can be changed though.
21:40:59 <skwisgaar[m]> The firewall doesnt allow you to block specific connections.
21:41:47 <leewww> do you think apple is copying graphene?

22:00:24 <dnull> patlastname[m]: Aurora Store?
22:01:41 <patlastname[m]> No, I'm sorry for poor wording, I downloaded and installed it but it always throws up an error saying it won't work without google play services installed
22:02:45 <leewww> isnt that anti competitive ?
22:03:09 <leewww> i think there a law for that
22:04:09 <patlastname[m]> Idk, I'm honestly not concerned with that at the moment cause there isn't a damn thing I can do about it on my own
22:04:10 <skwisgaar[m]> shibboleth: sure!
22:04:57 <dnull> patlastname[m]: That sucks, but hard to expect any less from google. Might try micro-g services or bsttsr yet just a straight voip provider.
22:05:40 <patlastname[m]> I tried microg, it doesn't seem to fully work on grapheneos
22:06:00 <dnull> Then may want a different provider.
22:06:44 <blacklight447[m]> Maybe you can download it via the aurora app store
22:06:51 <patlastname[m]> I've already sunk the money and lots of time, ik sunk cost falicy is dumb but I can't afford another service rn
22:07:05 <blacklight447[m]> Aurora is an open source app which lets you download apps from the official play store
