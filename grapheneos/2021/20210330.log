00:06:53 <piggu[m]> hey is there any support for like external screens ? like usb-c dp or something ?
00:06:56 <piggu[m]> i know google hates external screens specially on android
00:15:57 <Shawn95> Trying to set up VPN on Graphene, is it ok to use a 3rd party app like NordVPN? Tried to connect manually but they don't give the server details
00:22:12 <Shawn95> Or should I download OpenVPN?
00:31:21 <flimsybenefit[m]> Anyone know if there's a difference between for GrapheneOS between carrier unlocked & factory unlocked? I suppose carrier unlocked is like when it's originally locked by a carrier & unlocked after contract & factory unlocked is unlocked upon buying it. I'm not sure if it'll make a difference to GrapheneOS but I just wanna make sure
00:39:57 <trtaer> hey im on powershell installnig graphene using the cli guide on their website i just installed the os using it. now im trying to change directory. what is the path that i have to type in?
00:42:02 <trtaer> its on the flashing factory images section. it says cd sunfish-factory-2021.02.07.17. i typed in cd walleye-factory-2021.03.20.15 because im on a pixel 2 and it didnt cd
00:47:39 <tyty11[m]> hello
00:48:51 <tyty11[m]> can someone help me finish the cli installation guide? im on the change directory part. how do you cd in powershell to use the flash.bat at the end?
01:06:36 <LinusSexTips[m]> you're here https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#flashing-factory-images ?
01:06:43 <tyty11[m]> i downloaded the factory images already. im just on the cd part before i flash. what do i type in to change the directory? it doesnt work when i tye in the command
01:06:47 <tyty11[m]> yea
01:07:02 <tyty11[m]> when i type cd i get a red messeage in powershell
01:07:11 <LinusSexTips[m]> you need to move into the folder
01:07:15 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> ... make sure you the dir you are cd into exist
01:07:33 <tyty11[m]> what is the folder it installed to?
01:08:09 <LinusSexTips[m]> wherever you extracted the zip to
01:08:27 <tyty11[m]> i just pasted the command in there
01:09:54 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> xvf extract all files to the currect dir, it doesn't create a new folder
01:09:59 <tyty11[m]> okay
01:10:11 <tyty11[m]> so just create a new folder and extract the zip into it and then cd after?
01:10:18 <akc3n> tybach[m]: have you tried using the web installer?  It is so much easier
01:10:30 <Preload[m]> Does ls work in Windows Powershell? That may help determine where it is.
01:10:44 <Preload[m]> Not very familiar...
01:11:01 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> tyty11: you can do that, or just issue ./flash-all.sh on the current dir
01:11:30 <akc3n> tyty11[m]: https://grapheneos.org/install/web
01:12:15 <tyty11[m]> okay i changed the directory
01:12:21 <tyty11[m]> i just had to extract it
01:12:31 <tyty11[m]> now i see <waiting for any device>
01:12:40 <tyty11[m]> do i just reboot it into the bootloader menu?
01:13:17 <akc3n> dhsjwbbsjxndbs: he is on windows. Using power shell ( I don't see him mentioning anything about him using subsystem Linux on windows). So the xvf nor the ./flash-all.sh would apply to this.
01:13:47 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> tyty11: yes
01:13:57 <tyty11[m]> okay
01:14:28 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> akc3n: windows comes with xvf... ./flash-all.bat then...
01:14:42 <tyty11[m]> there its flashing now
01:15:04 <akc3n> dhsjwbbsjxndbs: ahh cool! I didn't know. Thanks for info.
01:15:08 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs>  * akc3n: windows comes with tar... ./flash-all.bat then...
01:15:30 <ultimateextras[m> Does Orbot work on Graphene?
01:16:35 <akc3n[m]> "ultimateextras" Don't invite me to your rooms, I'll leave. [CERTIFIED PEDOSLAYER]: yes it does.
01:16:45 <tyty11[m]> once it says press any key to exit is it flashed?
01:16:53 <tyty11[m]> just paste in fastboot flashing lock
01:18:13 <ultimateextras[m> I recall hearing that software is somewhat sandboxed from eachother in Graphene, this doesn't affect routing with Orbot, etc?
01:18:52 <tyty11[m]> alright i locked it thanks i got it downloaded
01:20:08 <akc3n[m]> <tyty11[m] "alright i locked it thanks i got"> Don't forget to disable OEM as per instructions.
01:20:21 <tyty11[m]> yea i was going to its taking a bit for the first boot
01:21:25 <akc3n[m]> <ultimateextras[m "I recall hearing that software i"> Please read over https://grapheneos.org/faq
01:21:53 <ultimateextras[m> (I actually did...)
01:24:04 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> you can just try it
01:27:52 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> also https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
01:41:59 <piggu[m]> <Shawn95 "Or should I download OpenVPN?"> use wireguard, it's much better
01:54:52 <deepthot[m]> Hi. I'm interested in running GrapheneOS but don't currently have a suitable phone. I assume you won't know until the hardware is confirmed, but it would be considered very likely that GrapheneOS will support the pixel 5a, right? And if so, how long after a new phone launch will GrapheneOS be ready for use?
01:56:56 <rny> deepthot[m]: depends when someone steps up to be a maintaner
01:59:01 <deepthot[m]> rny: Idk what that entails, but historically speaking how long after phone launches are the associated versions of GrapheneOS released?
01:59:42 <akc3n> deepthot[m]:  the Google Pixel 4a was released in August 2020 in North America. And the GrapheneOS release for the 4a was towards end of October 2020.
02:00:15 <deepthot[m]> akc3n: Got it. Thank!
02:00:34 <deepthot[m]>  * akc3n: Got it. Thanks!
02:00:57 <dannyknoll3Danny> deepthot: 5G makes cell carrier location privacy worse, if you can believe it. Maybe a 4a for now.
02:00:59 <dannyknoll3Danny> Solid.
02:01:13 <akc3n> With the 5a. I'm not sure when the actual release date is set for, but a brief search shows it as June 2021. Whether that's true or not, I don't know deepthot[m]
02:02:48 <deepthot[m]> akc3n: Right. That's what I'm working off of. So if it's similar to the 4a, GrapheneOS would be released perhaps around end of August.
02:03:08 <rny> deepthot[m]: anupritaisno1[m] probably understands what maintenance requires, from observation, you need to maintain the linux kernel tree specific to a device, support extracting APEX packages and relevant driver binaries from the google vendor image
02:03:38 <rny> on top of them, also tinker with the linux kernel flags and test if the tweaks work on the device
02:03:41 <akc3n[m]> deepthot: as rny has mentioned, it depends when someone steps up to be a maintainer
02:03:57 <rny> definitely non-trivial and can take quite a bit of time and effort
02:04:27 <rny> that is what i see from the commits made to the source tree, i dont know specifically the pain and effort they personally go thru to ship a release :/
02:04:29 <deepthot[m]> Understood, but difficult to predict, so I'm guessing based on past data
02:05:52 <deepthot[m]> <dannyknoll3Danny "deepthot: 5G makes cell carrier "> Was this a major issue for the 5a release?
02:06:08 <deepthot[m]> > <@dannyknoll3:tchncs.de> deepthot: 5G makes cell carrier location privacy worse, if you can believe it. Maybe a 4a for now.
02:06:08 <deepthot[m]>  * Was this a major issue for the 4a (5g) release?
02:09:13 <akc3n> deepthot[m]: the issue tracker would be a place to check for open or closed issues when searching for 4a 5G.
02:09:13 <akc3n> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
02:12:28 <rny> carrier-based issues are not something the OS can address
02:13:29 <rny> the OS project itself does its best to harden security and improve privacy for users within its application domain
02:13:32 <dannyknoll3Danny> deepthot Just the standard in general is less private, more granular location abilities.
02:16:04 <deepthot[m]> i see. thanks for the info.
05:58:13 <alteisenindo> hi i have a question
05:59:20 <alteisenindo> how can i change ro.build.date.utc found in build.prop?
06:04:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> alteisenindo: by building the rom yourself
06:12:15 <alteisenindo> I have built GrapheneOS for pixel4a a few times this week before but ro.build.date.utc stays the same. How can I change it?
06:19:56 <alteisenindo> I tried export BUILD_DATETIME and export BUILD_NUMBER to new values, but ro.build.date.utc won't change.
07:28:58 <popa> is there anyway to get push notifications to work on graphene with for example wickr?
07:29:13 <popa> now i have to open all apps to se new messages/notifications
07:29:40 <popa> or does it only work woth google services
07:36:36 <nscnt[m]> popa: Notifications on GrapheneOS do work. It's the app's fault. If they choose to deliver notifications exclusively with Play services, it won't work on GrapheneOS because it doesn't have Play services.
07:37:45 <popa> ok thanks, ye signal notifaction work but not wickr me
07:37:53 <popa> damn, ok i gotta find a other solution for that
07:37:59 <nscnt[m]> Signal, Element and other messengers have a fallback and don't rely exclusively on Play services to deliver notifications. They work without problems under GrapheneOS.
07:55:44 <s0s[l]> Yesterday Graphene on Pixel 3 got stuck in bootloop
07:56:13 <s0s[l]> I fixed it by sideloading OTA release
07:56:37 <s0s[l]> All apps stayed in tact
08:08:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> s0s[l]: that was completely unnecessary
08:09:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> you should read about the android update mechanism, specifically the A/B system
08:10:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> if after an update the systen fails to boot three times, it rolls back to the prev working condition
10:02:51 <s0s[l]> GrapheneOS-Teleg: it didn't roll back tho. I wouldn't take that step if it would. So it was necessary
10:06:02 <s0s[l]> Also the OS failing had nothing to do with updates. But I didn't have time to debug. The main goal was getting the OS operational again
12:02:00 <neverfinished[m]> anupritaisno1:
12:20:31 <M3manu31[m]> A few weeks ago, a dev has shared a preview movie of a 2FA (fingerprint + PIN or + pattern) for screen unlock. I don't remember the name and if it was here or in the off topic channel, sorry.
12:20:31 <M3manu31[m]> Please could you point me to the preview movie or the github / gitlab repo? Thx
12:56:42 <tadeuszwajcha[m]> Model pixel 2 XL LTE G011C, it's compatible with GraphenOS?
12:59:10 <neverfinished[m]> <tadeuszwajcha[m] "Model pixel 2 XL LTE G011C, it's"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
13:09:43 <tadeuszwajcha[m]> neverfinished: This does not answer my question. I asked a question about the exact designation of the PIXEL 2 XL model: G011C.
13:09:43 <tadeuszwajcha[m]> It did not concern this, whether it is still supported ... only whether the model is compatible with the system.
13:22:10 <jj88> Shoutout to the dev team: I've been custom installing ROMs since the Galaxy S1 beta phones; the process is known to be a bit technical. But that web installer for graphene OS was so slick my non-technical sister was able to do it. Way cool.
13:32:07 <Guest13> I have successfully rooted my xperia 1 , is supported?
13:32:32 <Thatcher[m]> <Guest13 "I have successfully rooted my xp"> No
13:33:43 <Guest13> it seem I met the Prerequisites . Why not? I got recovery on it.
13:34:15 <Guest13> or trying could brick my phone?
13:34:49 <Thatcher[m]> Requires a Pixel
13:36:08 <d42> how long do you think the fine developers of this excellent android system will support pixel3? 🤔
13:36:27 <d42> or is it more unforseen future
13:36:55 <nscnt[m]> For as long as there's upstream support for it
13:37:59 <kiagan[m]> Hardware support ends this year for pixel 3
13:38:08 <kiagan[m]> https://endoflife.date/pixel
13:41:12 <jj88> After I installed Stable GrapheneOS, wifi 2.4Ghz broke and rebooting does not help. Any suggestions? Simply wait for an update? This is a new phone, 2.4Ghz was also broken in AOSP until I got the latest OTA updates, verified everything worked, then installed GrapheneOS. Pixel4a
13:41:18 <nscnt[m]> It's a minimum
13:41:56 <nscnt[m]> well *no guarantee after that
13:42:40 <nscnt[m]> no guarantee that there will be updates
13:43:41 <d42> but is it more it won't get android 11+1 issue, or no security updates whatsoever
13:44:03 <kiagan[m]> No guarantee means no contract for firmware updates. Ie whenever a nontrivial issue is discovered after that date will be when it is EOL. Could be a day, could be a lot longer
13:44:46 <kiagan[m]> Operating assumption for planning should be the guaranteed date
13:56:19 <d42> but assuming that i use graphene after eol, will i still get webview updates, for an example? ;-;
14:05:38 <Xcutioner[m]> Hi anupritaisno1:   I tried to submit an issue for My PIxel4 5G on the Github, it took it at first and then discarded it.  Could you submit a issue that I can get any internet data on a StarightTalk Verizon sim for a Pixel 4A 5G?

14:23:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> hi all, I have been using graphene happily with google camera and photos (microg installed) for a year, but on moving to a pixel 5 the process isn't working. Is there any way round this please?
14:28:07 <Leo[m]6> How's the grapheneos camera compared to the stock one?
14:31:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> Not as good. Most crucially no wide angle
14:31:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> kinda a waste
14:31:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> is there a microg I have missed which plays a bit better with graphene or is it off to calyx with me?
14:37:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't have microg
14:37:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> We plan to do a stub implementation of google APIs soon
14:40:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> [/shakes fist at sky] it worked with my 3a. Guess I got lucky. Thanks. I will return when it's working then. I really really want the camera at full capacity otherwise it wasn't an upgrade
14:40:43 <strcat[m]> please don't discuss malicious projects spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS and harassing our developers here, thanks
14:41:00 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> wut?
14:43:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah shit I had forgotten
14:43:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Still haven't recovered
14:45:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically calyx actively spreads misinformation about us
14:45:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Promotes attacks against us
14:45:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Supports people promoting those attacks
14:45:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Many of their community members come here to raid the channels to waste development time
14:46:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> ah right ok. Sorry, just need somewhat better freedom from google, the decent camera. I am unsure about all this. Is there an option you can recommend that isn't out to get you?
14:46:54 <kamesjitt616[m]> Buy a separate camera
14:47:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <B​_i_s_c_u_i_t_s> i have a seperate camera. I get the message. Thanks all!
14:47:45 <strcat[m]> use the built-in camera app

15:01:12 <cryptokid777> : Hi, i know cellphone triangulation happens so the isp know the location of the device, but can the isp also see location history of a device that was always connected to carrier?
15:04:17 <grayhatter> cryptokid777: do you think there's a difference between an ISP and a carrier?
15:05:19 <cryptokid777> No, but i want to know if they can also see history of location or can they only see the location live ?
15:05:53 <timetravelingman> <d42 "but assuming that i use graphene"> No
15:05:57 <grayhatter> all carriers are ISP, but not all ISP are cell carriers, (unless you count parent companies and subsidiraries, then maybe it's both.... corp ownership is strange)
15:06:41 <grayhatter> cryptokid777: they can see when where and how long you're connected to them... then what ever data/information your devices leaks to them as well
15:07:17 <cryptokid777> Oke can they also see location triangulation history or only live location?
15:08:01 <grayhatter> can carrier/ISP A see history from carrier/ISP B? if they are sharing it yes
15:09:00 <cryptokid777> So triangulation happens all the time and the carrier is storing it and can always see the history?
15:09:05 <grayhatter> can carrier/ISP A see history from carrier/ISP A? obviously the answer is yes so either you don't understand anything about how cell networks work, or I don't understand what your asking
15:09:19 <mynacol[m]> <cryptokid777 "Oke can they also see location t"> Your phone won't shout out where it was, it even doesn't save it (maybe installed apps do). But this doesn't stop the carrier from recording triangulation data.
15:09:35 <grayhatter> that's correct, only they don't need to do triangulation, your cell will report it's GPS cords, as required for E911
15:10:21 <grayhatter> cryptokid777: but that won't protect your from advertisers, who *do* record your location history on device, and report it back to the mothership constantly
15:10:49 <grayhatter> location history they both buy and sell to and from your carrier/isp
15:11:02 <cryptokid777> Okey
15:11:34 <grayhatter> cryptokid777: if you're concerned about a threat/issue it's better to ask questions about that, we can probably help you better understand what you're really getting at
15:11:43 <cryptokid777> So my location is always known and if a government would need 1 year history of my cellphone they can easaly get it from carrier,
15:11:49 <mynacol[m]> <grayhatter "that's correct, only they don't "> I assume phones don't report their location all the time, only if calling an emergency service.
15:11:59 <grayhatter> asking if a carrier can track you is different from asking how do I prevent everyone from knowing my whole location history
15:12:11 <grayhatter> mynacol[m]: that assumption is incorrect
15:12:33 <mynacol[m]> <cryptokid777 "So my location is always known a"> Entirely depends on laws in the respective countries and if the carrier stores this data
15:13:08 <grayhatter> they don't report near GPS cords, but the cell towers have to know where you are within a range, if you're connected to >2 they know well enough, but say your out somewhere in the woods, and only connected to one, they will ask your cell for a course location, and it is supposed to provide it
15:13:17 <cryptokid777> Okey i understand, so turning gps off doesnt mean anything as they have my location constantly by celltower triangulation
15:13:36 <grayhatter> cryptokid777: it's more than just GPS and celltowers
15:14:30 <grayhatter> google want's you to keep your wifi on because they know exactly where every single wifi AP is (both public and private) and can use the singal strength from the local wifi APs to tranugalte exactly where you are
15:15:24 <grayhatter> in a big city you can get better than GPS location accuracy from wifi APs than you can from an actual GPS location
15:15:30 <mynacol[m]> <grayhatter "mynacol: that assumption is inco"> > The FCC also requires wireless telephone carriers to provide 911 and E911 capability, where a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) requests it.
15:16:18 <mynacol[m]> grayhatter: So please don't spread misinformation yourself
15:16:43 <grayhatter> I hate those laws... carriers know where your device is within 3m, yet they only have to report it to e911 35m
15:17:07 <dazinism> Yeah I'm pretty sure phones report their location.
15:17:49 <grayhatter> mynacol[m]: I used to work for a govt contractor doing security reasearch on 4g and 5g systems... but you're right I don't know what I'm talking about.... only spreading misinformation
15:18:06 <mynacol[m]> <dazinism "Yeah I'm pretty sure phones repo"> When calling emergency services, sure. But please provide proof that they intentionally do so in other situations.
15:18:20 <dazinism> *don't constantly report their location
15:18:27 <mynacol[m]> <grayhatter "mynacol: I used to work for a go"> US I guess?
15:18:45 <grayhatter> correct
15:18:51 <dazinism> Sorry I missed the don't
15:19:08 <dazinism> * Yeah I'm pretty sure phones don't constantly  report their location.
15:19:11 <mynacol[m]> grayhatter: Other countries have other laws, so please don't shout "every carrier sells your location data"
15:19:21 <grayhatter> mynacol[m]: that's a good point
15:19:29 <grayhatter> my information is only for US carriers
15:19:30 <mynacol[m]> Whereas some countries prohibit that by law
15:23:00 <grayhatter> I would be very surprised if every carrier didn't track device location while it's connected to it's network
15:23:39 <grayhatter> every single carrier grade system I've worked on logs singnal strength by default, which are then collected by the local hub
15:24:00 <dazinism> Yeah, I'm pretty sure they log that and it gets used as evidence for criminal cases
15:24:14 <grayhatter> what they do with that information is a different story, but I know they *all* collect it at the very least
15:24:53 <dazinism> Via triangulation. People were getting that stuff used against them in court in the days before smartphones
15:28:03 <dazinism> grayhatter: US carriers are/were using Googles location services (including WiFi network  based) to identify device location?
15:29:04 <grayhatter> they might now for selling data to advertisers... but not that I know of
15:29:08 <dazinism> GrapheneOS has a load of the carrier software stripped out.
15:29:47 <grayhatter> I know the carriers systems better than I know the phones, but I don't remember seeing anything like that... the cell radio provides close enough location for everything we'd need/want
15:30:20 <dazinism> grayhatter: so you found they are location tracking via triangulation
15:30:40 <dazinism> Rather than anything else?
15:30:44 <grayhatter> found?
15:31:03 <grayhatter> like personally? no that's something I learned apart from my work/reserach
15:31:25 <grayhatter> there's a reason your cell radio also has GPS in it
15:31:41 <dazinism> Sorry, guess I'm getting a bit confused
15:31:50 <grayhatter> ...well there's a lot of reasons, but one of them is so the radio can as for gps location without waking the device
15:32:46 <grayhatter> on most smart phones, the cell radio has it's own "CPU" which can do anything it wants without your device... often without the device even being on
15:33:20 <grayhatter> there's a reason government issued phones all have removable batteries
15:33:41 <dazinism> I'd like to see proper research confirming this.
15:33:48 <grayhatter> me too
15:34:08 <dazinism> Otherwise it's kind of speculation
15:34:39 <dazinism> Theoretically theres all kinds of terrible things that could happen.
15:35:00 <grayhatter> the cell hardware being a chip seperate from cell phones chip is well known though, is that what you meant?
15:35:22 <dazinism> No, thats not what I mean.
15:36:00 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: the Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular radios are implemented by an isolated chiplet on the same SoC
15:36:15 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: same SoC
15:36:19 <strcat[m]> not a different party to trust
15:36:24 <strcat[m]> you trust them for the CPU already...
15:36:30 <strcat[m]> what you said above makes no sense at all and is false
15:37:09 <grayhatter> strcat[m]: correct me if I'm wrong, because again I don't do endpoint hardware, but there used to be phone hardware with an "isolated" cell chipset that had DMA
15:37:30 <strcat[m]> DMA does not mean not isolated because there's an IOMMU
15:37:43 <strcat[m]> the baseband is isolated
15:37:54 <grayhatter> that's not how it is on modern nor google hardware
15:38:10 <strcat[m]> please read the FAQ
15:38:19 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#baseband-isolation
15:39:36 <strcat[m]> cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are implemented on the same chiplet as sandboxed processes in an L4-based RTOS
15:39:52 <strcat[m]> and the overall thing is isolated from the rest of the SoC
15:39:59 <strcat[m]>  * and the overall baseband is isolated from the rest of the SoC
15:40:20 <strcat[m]> GPS is receive only and is not inherently tied to cellular
15:42:00 <grayhatter> strcat[m]: on hardware with a baseband chip seperate from the primary SoC, that has DMA, how does the OS prevent it from making raw reads to memory?
15:42:17 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: read the FAQ
15:42:18 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#baseband-isolation
15:42:33 <grayhatter> I did but it didn't really address my question
15:42:50 <strcat[m]> > Yes, the baseband is isolated on all of the officially supported devices. Memory access is partitioned by the IOMMU and limited to internal memory and memory shared by the driver implementations.
15:42:53 <strcat[m]> there is there answer
15:42:57 <strcat[m]> 2nd sentence
15:43:09 <strcat[m]> same applies to other SoC components and peripherals
15:43:27 <grayhatter> but to be clear, that's not the case for other unsupported devices?
15:43:31 <strcat[m]> DMA access is not access to all memory, only access to the memory regions that the driver has enabled it to access
15:43:40 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: we don't write documentation on all possible devices
15:44:04 <strcat[m]> we write documentation on the modern, secure ones we support
15:44:18 <strcat[m]> we don't have to document that the Nexus 5X had the Broadcom Wi-Fi SoC set up able to access all memory on the device
15:44:21 <strcat[m]> because we don't support that phone
15:44:27 <strcat[m]>  * we don't have to document that the Nexus 6P had the Broadcom Wi-Fi SoC set up able to access all memory on the device
15:44:32 <grayhatter> fair point
15:44:37 <grayhatter> my apologies
15:44:42 <dazinism> Speculating in a way that suggests the GPS and cellular being on the same chip means that carriers may be constantly logging your GPS isn't useful.
15:44:52 <strcat[m]> it's not accurate
15:45:14 <strcat[m]> E911 is activated when making a 911, etc. call and also it's not like the carrier doesn't already have the info
15:45:21 <strcat[m]> GPS takes a significant amount of time to get a lock
15:45:38 <grayhatter> <10s with aGPS and a previous lock
15:46:23 <strcat[m]> when outdoors, and with a previous lock
15:47:15 <strcat[m]> when you're connected to the cellular network, it inherently knows a rough location of the device and it can be triangulated from multiple towers
15:47:42 <grayhatter> yeah, and again, my apologies. I'd forgotten this was conversation in #grapheneos and not a random security conversation where all devices were on the table
15:47:57 <strcat[m]> the device is not reporting location via GPS to the network outside of E911 and even then it's not like that does much
15:48:00 <strcat[m]> they already know where you are
15:48:05 <strcat[m]> E911 works without GPS
15:48:30 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
15:48:52 <strcat[m]> to not have your location known to the cellular network, you need to not connect to the cellular network, which is fully supported
15:49:19 <strcat[m]> it's inherently the way cellular networks work
15:49:26 <dazinism> strcat: do you know if making a 911 call flips on location in the OS if you have it disabled?
15:49:28 <strcat[m]> the subscriber has to authenticate themselves to the network
15:49:40 <strcat[m]> dazinism: no, it doesn't
15:50:07 <strcat[m]> dazinism: location toggle in the OS is for whether the application layer has location services (of any kind) available
15:50:49 <dazinism> e911 isn't done by an app then?
15:51:03 <strcat[m]> dazinism: it is to some extent
15:52:33 <strcat[m]> dazinism: the dialer app isn't supplying the location
15:52:47 <dazinism> So with location off e911 gets no extra location data from device?  They just rely on tower triangulation
15:52:59 <strcat[m]> no
15:53:12 <strcat[m]> just explaining to you that the location toggle in the OS is not relevant to this
15:53:41 <strcat[m]> the location toggle in the OS is whether apps which have been granted location access by you can access it
15:54:04 <strcat[m]> it's a global toggle for whether the granted permission is active
15:54:07 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with this
15:55:03 <dazinism> OK
16:06:16 <pizzaeater69[m]> How often should I set Auditor to submit remote attestion? Every hour? Every week?
16:06:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Maybe after every update.
16:09:26 <strcat> pizzaeater69[m]: default is fine
16:10:16 <strcat> if you have an alert email set, you receive an alert if no valid attestation has been sent for the time period set for the alert delay

18:13:57 <tadeuszwajcha[m]> Device*
18:14:00 <tadeuszwajcha[m]> I have Pixel 2 XL
18:14:01 <strcat[m]> all covered in https://grapheneos.org/install/web
18:14:11 <strcat[m]> > It's best practice to update the device before installing GrapheneOS to have the latest firmware for connecting the phone to the computer and performing the early flashing process. Either way, GrapheneOS flashes the latest firmware early in the installation process.
18:46:54 <doittoit[m]> Picked up a used pixel 4xl that is GSMA. Even though it is a carrier varient can I just try to flash GOS and see what happens. In the description below it seems to imply that any carrier variants will have to have been already disabled if GOS is to be able to be flashed. But, would there be a case where the carrier varient was unlocked, GOS did flash, but there were problems because the phone was not universally
18:46:54 <doittoit[m]> unlocked? Essentially, will I be able to tell GOS is stable simply by finding that it sucessfully flashes?
18:47:23 <doittoit[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#prerequisites
18:48:56 <entry1[m]> <doittoit[m] "Picked up a used pixel 4xl that "> As long as you can enabke OEM unlocking in developer options, the phone will function with GrapheneOS. If it is carrier locked, then you will be restricted to that carrier.
18:49:06 <entry1[m]> * As long as you can enable OEM unlocking in developer options, the phone will function with GrapheneOS. If it is carrier locked, then you will be restricted to that carrier.
18:53:40 <doittoit[m]> Thanks for this, but sorry, I'm still confused. I thought OEM unlocking at developing screen was not associated with carrier "unlocking". I thought it had to do with Google Pixel Android 11.
18:56:12 <entry1[m]> <doittoit[m] "Thanks for this, but sorry, I'm "> So enabling OEM unlocking allows you to access the bootloader. If the OEM unlocking isn't available, then you can not flash GrapheneOS. Most carrier locked phones do not have an unlockable bootloader, but some have exceptions. If the Pixel is factory unlocked, then it will 100% have an unlockable bootloader.
18:58:55 <doittoit[m]> Bummer. So that means I have to make sure the phone is unlocked, otherwise I might have one of these exceptions, and wind up with a locked phone. I was hoping to avoid talking to the carrier 😩.
18:58:55 <doittoit[m]> Thanks for your help.

19:02:16 <trail_undergroun> Not sure if this is off topic but does anyone know anything about the next Pixel to come out and how long it might take for Graphene to support it?
19:06:41 <entry1[m]> <trail_undergroun "Not sure if this is off topic bu"> That would be OT. Next Pixel release is most likely the 5a around summer. Since this is an open source project that requires a lot of work by the lead developers and extensive testing, there wouldn't be an estimated timeframe to when (or if) GrapheneOS will be available for the device. Once a new device is released, there is usually a call for people who can help
19:06:42 <entry1[m]> offer their expertise and time to help the project.

22:28:04 <hello_world> Hello,
22:28:05 <hello_world> I love using GrapheneOS, but unfortunately I can't do without a few data krakens. e.g. I can't do without reddit, spotify, soundclound etc..
22:28:05 <hello_world> I use island (https://github.com/oasisfeng/island) so that these apps have limited access. This is kinda outdated but I like the idea of virtualization.
22:28:06 <hello_world> Does it make sense to do this or are there better solutions?
22:28:06 <hello_world> I would not like to use a second device, but if absolutely needed, I will do that too.
22:28:32 <hello_world> Or can this be done via different profiles?
22:29:41 <IPFreely> Spotify/Soundcloud are glorified MP3 players. What happened to downloading a collection of your favorite music and playing it offline?
22:30:01 <IPFreely> Reddit works in a browser, or am I missing something..
22:30:46 <IPFreely> Also, there are some really nice alternatives to Spotify-style of apps.
22:32:22 <hello_world> Yes, there are some alternatives for most of these services but it's always some work to set it up.
22:33:42 <hello_world> What I care about is not the tracking inside these apps. I care about cross tracking.
22:34:41 <hello_world> Or at least isolate them from my core apps. signal/session
22:35:16 <hello_world> Is this possible?
