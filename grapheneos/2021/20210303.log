00:00:10 <strcat[m]> testing123testin: can confirm the problem, wouldn't have made it to Beta channel
00:00:23 <strcat[m]> testing123testin: can't really do anything about it yet, still working on other stuff for the release
00:00:42 <testing123testin> no worries, I appreciate it
00:34:31 <bizanon[m]> Is there any way to add tasks on the default calendar app?
00:40:35 <Jack868> I'm having some issues receiving push alerts from iSmartalarm and SchlageHome
00:41:18 <strcat[m]> testing123testin: issue has been resolved, just needs a rebuild
00:41:26 <Jack868> I got some push alerts to start coming through but then they stopped.
00:41:28 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's just a sample app, use Etar or another alternative
00:41:32 <strcat[m]> we'll hide the sample app
00:55:28 <bizanon[m]> Trying to install an android game. It says gsf dependent. Will it work on gos?

00:59:04 <hypokeimenon[m]> Someone might find the information useful.
01:00:11 <megan-riley> TheJollyRoger-M Are you around?
01:01:28 <megan-riley> Anybody know where to get some good wallpapers for graphene?
01:01:49 <emdevd> images.google.com
01:01:52 <louipx> whats good
01:02:07 <testing123testin> I always get my wallpapers from https://4chan.org/wg/
01:02:26 <testing123testin> just ctrl+f "phone" and there's good stuff
01:02:37 <testing123testin> ignore anything else on that website

01:02:57 <megan-riley> thanks testing123testin
01:05:09 <bizanon[m]> Is it safe to enable USB debugging for tether?
01:05:15 <megan-riley> emdevd , I'll look there, too, as long as google hasn't any tentacles attached to their wallpapers
01:05:29 <bizanon[m]> I read developer setting is dangerous
01:08:40 <megan-riley> LOL bizanon[m]
01:08:40 <megan-riley> louipx , It's in the eye of beholder isn't it?
01:08:48 <strcat[m]> bizanon: USB debugging isn't used for tethering
01:08:57 <strcat[m]> bizanon: that's not where that's turned on
01:09:26 <louipx> megan-riley: could be
01:12:53 <megan-riley> cs
01:23:23 <BobBraxboi[m]> This was probably asked before but how well does Signal work on Graphene without GSF?
01:23:50 <strcat[m]> it works fine without Play services
01:24:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have the most optimized push implementation but it doesn't drain a huge amount of power
01:24:23 <strcat[m]> the main impact is that device won't be able to sleep for long periods of time since they don't properly throttle the pings to keep push connection alive
01:24:33 <Jack868> I don't use signal a whole lot but it appears to be basically working
01:24:56 <BobBraxboi[m]> <strcat[m] "the main impact is that device w"> Ah. Itâ€™ll have to do!
01:24:57 <strcat[m]> so for example when the phone is sitting idle unused, it increases battery usage
01:26:46 <Jack868> So I'm having some trouble with push notifications from certain apps. Whats the deal with GOS and push notifications?
01:27:18 <Jack868> I use the Remotelync app for instance to monitor smoke detectors and I'm not receiving the push alerts.
01:27:44 <Jack868> I use the SchlageHome app for push notifcations about doors being locked and unlocked. Thats not working.
01:27:58 <strcat> Jack868: push notifications work fine if the app implements them when Play services isn't present
01:28:18 <strcat> Jack868: some apps provide an implementation that doesn't depend on sending push messages through Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
01:28:20 <strcat> other apps don't
01:28:48 <strcat> Signal has an implementation of non-FCM push (which as I said above, isn't great, but does the job)
01:28:56 <Jack868> Is there any way to tell which apps use FCM?
01:28:59 <strcat> some apps do, others don't
01:29:04 <strcat> Jack868: look at the source code
01:29:08 <strcat> or disassemble it
01:29:21 <strcat> using FCM != not having an alternative to FCM though
01:29:23 <MachX> apk files can be reverse engineered pretty easily no?
01:29:24 <strcat> Signal uses FCM
01:29:29 <strcat> and when FCM isn't there, it uses non-FCM push
01:29:33 <strcat> MachX: yes
01:29:39 <strcat> so, using FCM isn't the problem
01:29:47 <strcat> the problem is not having an alternative to using FCM in some apps
01:29:51 <strcat> while others do
01:30:24 <strcat> Jack868: this is where you leave a review talking about how they only support push notifications via Google services with no fallback
01:30:28 <strcat> and message the app devs
01:30:33 <strcat> and if enough of their users care
01:30:36 <strcat> maybe they will implement it
01:30:42 <strcat> nothing that we can do to make it happen
01:30:46 <Jack868> ok
01:31:08 <strcat> since we aren't going to be including FCM and Google has chosen not to support installing a version of Play services as a user installable app
01:31:13 <strcat> which they could do if they wanted

01:31:20 <bizanon[m]> I've been using clockworkmod tether for the longest time
01:31:28 <strcat> but I don't think you'd want that anyway
01:31:30 <bizanon[m]> tells me to enable USB debug
01:32:00 <strcat> bizanon[m]: why aren't you using the OS USB tethering
01:32:05 <strcat> bizanon[m]: don't use that
01:32:27 <strcat> bizanon[m]: why would you grant your computer a massive level of access to your phone and trust all applications on it (including this) with it
01:32:31 <strcat> to use a feature that's built in?
01:32:57 <bizanon[m]> Ahh I didn't know
01:32:59 <strcat> if you use USB debugging + trust the computer, since desktop OSes have no application security model, you don't just trust that hardware + OS but also all applications on it
01:33:07 <strcat> with USB debugging access
01:33:11 <strcat> which is a fair bit of access
01:34:04 <megan-riley> Anyone, "Notification Dot on App Icon" is turned on, but I'm not getting any dots for calls or messages. Any thoughts?
01:34:09 <strcat> record your screen when plugged in, take all your user profile home dir files, app data for apps allowing remote backups, enable any runtime/development permissions, install apps, and so on
01:34:20 <bizanon[m]> <strcat "bizanon: why aren't you using th"> OK I'll try this
01:34:33 <bizanon[m]> The reason was T-Mobile would throttle my speed
01:34:48 <bizanon[m]> That's why I used the app to bypass that
01:34:56 <strcat> megan-riley: long press home screen -> click dot option -> give launcher notification access
01:35:19 <strcat> we don't currently bundle a default permission whitelist to give it that access by default
01:35:24 <strcat> (AOSP doesn't)
01:37:34 <bizanon[m]> USB tethering is grayed out. Will it become changeable after I connect to PC?
01:37:35 <Jack868> I think I know what Bizanon is talking about. There's some apps that can hide tethering usage. You plug the phone into a PC and the PC makes its own wifi network. Other devices can connect to the PC and use the tethering data without being throttled.
01:37:51 <bizanon[m]> <Jack868 "I think I know what Bizanon is t"> Yeah that
01:38:56 <megan-riley> Thanks strcat! That done the trick. Graphen Launcher didn't have permissions/access.
01:40:08 <strcat[m]> bizanon: strongly recommend against using USB debugging on a production phone meant to be secure
01:40:28 <strcat[m]> it's a huge sacrifice and you reduce a lot of security to anything you trust with access to that
01:40:39 <strcat[m]> i.e. anything running on your laptop or whatever
01:45:01 <Jack868> I encountered a problem with Skytube today. It appears to be throttled or extremely slow for playing Youtube videos. My regular videos sometimes took 30 secs to load or wouldn't load at all. I lowered the video quality all the way to 480p and still had some buffering.

01:52:17 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> Hi, bluetooth function suddenly broke down when I connected to my bluetooth function. After that I couldn't enable it no matter how I tried. A restart fixed it for me. I wonder if this is a mere random bug in the system or something else is triggered by my headphones. Thanks!
01:52:27 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> *my bluetooth headphones

01:57:09 <strcat[m]> ah
01:57:10 <strcat[m]> Pixel 5
01:57:35 <strcat[m]> d3nm6ugnffwftn2j43ni: well there's a major AOSP bug fix release we'll be pushing out today
01:57:44 <strcat[m]> d3nm6ugnffwftn2j43ni: and those are pretty new devices
01:58:07 <strcat[m]> it's quite possible hardened_malloc is uncovering a bug, but it's best to worry about it after the next release (if it happens again) since so much is getting fixed by this release
01:58:14 <flawedworld[m]> could hardened_malloc audio bug workaround no longer being there affect bluetooth?
01:58:19 <strcat[m]> yes
01:58:28 <strcat[m]> but no one reported issues
01:58:34 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> <strcat[m] "d3nm6ugnffwftn2j43ni: and those "> Okay! I'll just wait for the release and see if the problem still happens. Thanks a lot!
01:58:48 <flawedworld[m]> yeah i didnt face any, im downloading latest build rn
01:58:57 <strcat[m]> flawedworld: I don't think it impacts bluetooth in that way
01:59:06 <strcat[m]> it just stopped audio devices being ordered properly so it'd play in wrong device
01:59:11 <strcat[m]> it didn't break bluetooth like that at all
01:59:15 <strcat[m]> it just had audio devices ordered wrong
01:59:19 <strcat[m]> so I don't think it's relevant
01:59:26 <flawedworld[m]> Ah I see, thats just me not being in the loop
01:59:30 <flawedworld[m]> makes sense
02:07:12 <rny> we should use the #grapheneos-dev channel more
02:07:21 <rny> to keep all developers in the loop
02:08:49 <strcat> rny: the +i thing broke it so there aren't many ppl there now
02:09:09 <strcat> I removed it already
02:09:32 <rny> can you give +I so it auto-invites?
02:09:51 <rny> *gives invite exemption
02:09:58 <strcat> I guess I can do that
02:10:53 <strcat> rny: do I do it with chanserv access list?
02:10:55 <strcat> or just in the channel
02:13:04 <rny> channel modes

02:39:38 <skagreek[m]> This place is just too awesome!
02:52:27 <strcat> testing123testin: will have that release soon
02:52:34 <strcat> testing123testin: you'll need to sideload it again
02:52:50 <strcat> let me test it first this time though, lol
02:53:09 <testing123testin> sure thing heh
02:53:52 <strcat[m]> testing123testin: the issue was AOSP did some weird rename of the touchscreen driver repo
02:54:18 <testing123testin> that's rude
02:54:24 <strcat[m]> they renamed the 4a one to fts_touch_s5 from fts_touch
02:54:29 <strcat[m]> it's still fts_touch driver
02:54:45 <strcat[m]> and they put the wrong code (Pixel 4 version) in the Pixel 4a tag for fts_touch
02:54:48 <strcat[m]> I think it was a mistake
02:55:03 <strcat[m]> so it was the Pixel 4 variation of the driver
02:55:15 <strcat[m]> slightly different (based on slightly older branch)
02:55:20 <strcat[m]> and didn't work
02:55:43 <testing123testin> interesting, thank you for the explanation
04:12:13 <captchaczech[m]> Does Graphene's OS hardening and protection against non-changeable identifiers extend to browsing?
04:12:55 <strcat> captchaczech[m]: a web page doesn't have access to the stuff talked about there
04:13:22 <strcat> captchaczech[m]: Vanadium looks the same on the same device model across different installations
04:13:42 <captchaczech[m]> If I set up a google voice account I'll be okay?
04:14:03 <strcat> I'm unclear on exactly what you're asking
04:14:24 <captchaczech[m]> My phone is pseudo-anonymous and I plan to port an old number to google voice. I plan to make the account on google voice
04:15:02 <captchaczech[m]> Google knows my true id from the ported number but can't "link" the device because my device looks like any other graphene os device
04:15:27 <captchaczech[m]> it is almost like using a vpn except, without using a vpn
04:20:50 <captchaczech[m]> not a vpn butyou know what i mean
04:22:29 <captchaczech[m]> a VPN Over Vanadium on Graphene will not allow google to uniquely ID my device.
04:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> captchaczech[m]: Unless you mess with the settings that were placed very deliberately, GrapheneOS aims to have both the hardware and software fingerprint of another Pixel device running the factory operating system, with Play Services disabled.
04:24:14 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to Vanadium.
04:24:28 <TheJollyRoger> This is to maintain as large an anonymity set as possible.
04:25:31 <TheJollyRoger> ie: the number of people who could plausibly be you.
04:25:46 <strcat> testing123testin: you can download the release now, there's a new one fixing that issue, which should go to beta channel soon
04:26:08 <testing123testin> tysm!!!!!
04:26:12 <testing123testin> I will get it
04:26:16 <strcat> testing123testin: it's tested now, so just do what you did before, sideload it
04:26:19 <strcat> but in the future
04:26:23 <strcat>  wait til they are listed as beta
04:26:29 <testing123testin> Sure thing, will do
04:30:13 <TheJollyRoger> captchaczech[m]: Android 10, and GrapheneOS block apps' access to non-resettable identifiers: legacy apps not compiled for Android 10 just get a bunch of zeroes in return if they ask you for your device's IMEI, SIM card number, device or SIM serial number, etc. The apps aren't privvy to that, and Vanadium does not, and cannot send them.
04:31:59 <captchaczech[m]> Okay thank you. It sounds like I am safe to use google web services then
04:34:01 <TheJollyRoger> captchaczech[m]: bit of trivia: if apps compiled for Android 10 request hardware IDs, the operating system will send them back "Error: Security Exception."
04:34:22 <TheJollyRoger> If apps compiled for older versions of Android request hardware IDs, the operating system will send back all zeroes.
04:34:27 <zzxx123> <captchaczech[m] "a VPN Over Vanadium on Graphene "> You are under estimating how niche GrapheneOS is, on top of that, you have your specific model, timezone, IP, DNS. This combination is enough to identify you.
04:36:40 <captchaczech[m]> If you remove IP and DNS -due to VPN -and change the timezone, it will make me look like a select few grapheneOS device.. which now that i think about it, might put me on a list just like Linux users are put on a list
04:36:49 <captchaczech[m]> ðŸ¤”
04:37:15 <captchaczech[m]> Serious. You think they mark GrapheneOS users like they mark Linux users as "suspicious"
04:37:24 <TheJollyRoger> Well if you remove DNS, your phone won't be able to resolve domain names.

04:39:28 <captchaczech[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Well if you remove DNS, your pho"> You are taking it literally. I meant to say I will use a VPN during account creation which will mask the DNS and IP.
04:39:57 <TheJollyRoger> captchaczech[m]: I enjoy a bit of literalist humour!
04:40:16 <zzxx123> VPN A is different from VPN B
04:40:21 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: we don't do anything weird on the site so if Firefox on legacy old Ubuntu versions crashes it's pretty broken

04:40:36 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: i.e. that legacy ubuntu version's firefox is broken not our site
04:40:38 <strcat[m]> report it to them
04:41:23 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: we use TLS 1.3 and HTTP/2 push, maybe it had a buggy implementation of one of those, we do nothing weird / particularly advanced at all
04:41:31 <strcat[m]> it's an incredibly simple site

04:44:22 <testing123testin> will the oneÂ  I downloaded be the same as the beta or should I also update when the beta comes out?
04:44:41 <strcat[m]> captchaczech: if you're going to *use* it after creating it
04:44:55 <strcat[m]> then I don't know why you're particularly concerned with creating it over where you use it afterwards

04:52:06 <zzxx123> Well Google have you real phone number, recorded your speech for speech pattern analysis, and voice fingerprinting. Linking to a device is nothing compare that.
04:53:03 <bizanon[m]> Personally I would choose gos to make the g account
04:53:25 <captchaczech[m]> <zzxx123 "Well Google have you real phone "> Exactly they do this to all users. But, remember, I'm going to forward the google voice to a twilio number which is going to forward to linphone. I'm not forwarding google voice to my real number.
04:53:52 <captchaczech[m]> <bizanon[m] "Personally I would choose gos to"> I was thinking that too. can you explain your logic.
04:55:11 <bizanon[m]>  desktop has more fingerprints. Think audio fingerprint, the number of fonts in the system, and if you're using chrome, then u have some FP associated with when you installed the browser.
04:55:54 <captchaczech[m]> <zzxx123 "Well Google have you real phone "> An alternative will be to forward the number to JMP.chat/xxmp
04:56:28 <captchaczech[m]> <bizanon[m] " desktop has more fingerprints. "> This was my thinking too
04:59:16 <captchaczech[m]> Wamrjuice made a good point about # of users too. More chance to blend in with the masses, assuming your desktop isn't too unique.
05:04:39 <zzxx123> <captchaczech[m] "Exactly they do this to all user"> You are still feeding Google data and help them with AI training. Your friend can have your virtual number and real name in their contact, and uploaded to Google.
05:05:19 <bizanon[m]> Yeah bro just ditch gvoice lol
05:06:20 <zzxx123> <bizanon[m] "Personally I would choose gos to"> Vanadium isnâ€™t anywhere close to private , proper desktop Tor browser is far better at anonymity.

05:57:01 <M3manu31[m]> Guys just want to give you (finally good news) update. Boot issue solve. Original Pixel 5 cable didnâ€™t work; error during flashing routine. Picked an another (old and badly bended) usb c cable and it worked.
05:57:58 <strcat> M3manu31[m]: your USB-C port is probably broken
05:58:00 <strcat> not the cable
05:58:09 <captchaczech[m]> was it usbc to usb c 2a or c2c?
05:58:19 <strcat> or OS support for newer USB standard is broken
05:59:23 <M3manu31[m]> it was a pretty new dell with updated Windows same plug just replaced the cable
06:38:06 <strcat[m]> March release is in Beta
06:38:08 <strcat[m]> please help with testing it
06:38:15 <strcat[m]> bigger release than usual for a monthly one
06:40:37 <strcat[m]> going to sleep, going to need another release pretty soon for Vanadium rebase to Chromium 89 and some additional upstream kernel fixes

09:48:19 <rny> Terma: search the logs, this was discussed yesterday
09:55:53 <Terma> cheers I found the answer to my question!
09:57:14 <Terma> If I understood correctly, netguard is superfluous on grapheneOS since the OS network toggle works a lot better
09:58:32 <TheLoneWanderer[> Yes
10:23:46 <rhythm[m]> <Terma "If I understood correctly, netgu"> Why u need netguard? Graphene has great permission manager.

10:50:00 <emrysmerlin[m]> My friend loves Graphene OS he thinks Is lineage OS done by inexperienced developers? Because my he try their ROM again since back in 2015 they didn't fix the encryption on their devices. Its 2021 and still not fix! LineageOS is a joke! Lol ðŸ˜‚

12:02:10 <alex-resist> nscnt well yes, all it says is "rebased onto RQ2A.210305.006 release, initial release of Android 11 QPR2 (Quarterly Platform Release 2)"
12:02:32 <alex-resist> I am curious where to find additional information regarding that specific bullet point
12:12:35 <nscnt[m]> alex-resist: There are releases https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds
12:12:49 <nscnt[m]> They cover a security patch level https://source.android.com/security/bulletin

15:25:09 <Sparty> Hi guys
15:26:47 <TheLoneWanderer[> Hey
15:27:00 <Sparty> Today i received my pixel 5 and installed graphene, i noticed no default wallper and no wallpapers at all on the phone, is it ok? did i installed it wrong?
15:28:45 <Sparty> Not that i really care about those, it just sounded bit off, just checking with you...
15:28:53 <TheLoneWanderer[> It's fine
15:28:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Kâ€‹ileXt> Nop it's normal, I was quite surprised too
15:29:10 <TheLoneWanderer[> You can use the auditor app to check system integrity
15:29:16 <Sparty> but now I kinda like that, no bloat to the next level :)
15:29:48 <Sparty> so let's just pick a picture of my dog doing something embarrasising and we are set!
15:30:07 <Sparty> but thanks!
15:38:17 <vdge[m]> I wish AOSP has 'end session' for profiles. Damn! this thing is super useful.
15:38:17 <vdge[m]> Is there any equivalent in AOSP apart from rebooting
15:40:20 <Sparty> TheLoneWanderer[ don't i need a second device for the auditor app to work?
15:40:44 <stencil[m]> Y
15:40:55 <ulmirdin[m]> Sparty: you can verify your device using attestation website
15:40:57 <stencil[m]> Or you can do server side auditing
15:41:41 <Sparty> what is the attestation website?
15:42:19 <ulmirdin[m]> https://attestation.app/
15:42:34 <Sparty> tx!
15:43:08 <TheLoneWanderer[> Any relatively new android device will work as well
15:45:49 <Sparty> I just saw that i csan use my s9+
15:46:16 <Sparty> another question: do you guys use microg or you just gave up on playstore (what about banking etc?)?
15:47:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
15:48:07 <ulmirdin[m]> <Sparty "another question: do you guys us"> MicroG is not provided by GrapheneOS. For google play install Aurora Store.
15:48:27 <Sparty> exactly what i was looking for, thanks
15:49:10 <Sparty> and do you trust aurora store?
15:49:53 <Sparty> i mean microg also provides an api substrate that is needed by a lot if not almost all apps to work
15:50:00 <ulmirdin[m]> For aurora store, nightly releases are less buggy (ironic) you can get it here https://auroraoss.com/AuroraStore/Nightly/
15:51:20 <Real[m]1> Hey
15:51:28 <ulmirdin[m]> <Sparty "and do you trust aurora store?"> it's more secure than f-droid (Foss app store) and it's open source as well.
15:51:37 <Real[m]1> can anyone help me with installation
15:51:44 <TheLoneWanderer[> ^Nightly can't work without files permission though
15:52:06 <Real[m]1> Stable channel or beta channel
15:52:39 <Real[m]1> For graphene
15:52:54 <ulmirdin[m]> rick: Stable is more...stable. If you use your phone as your daily driver, then choose stable.
15:53:05 <Sparty> Real[m]1if you are uncertain then most probably you don't need beta
15:53:46 <Real[m]1> Alright
15:55:17 <Sparty> So looks like graphene moks play services as much as possible, so first i should try my banking app and see if it just works
15:56:05 <ulmirdin[m]> <TheLoneWanderer[ "^Nightly can't work without file"> Huh, never paid attention to that. I assumed an app store must have files permissionðŸ¤”
15:56:17 <dannyknoll3[m]> <Sparty "i mean microg also provides an a"> I find the last part of this statement to be wildly inaccurate
15:56:46 <Sparty> please let me know better i just started reading
15:56:46 <TheLoneWanderer[> <ulmirdin[m] "Huh, never paid attention to tha"> In 3.XX, you can deny it and select "Download to internal storage"
15:56:48 <ulmirdin[m]> Most apps work without Play Services just fine.
15:57:11 <TheLoneWanderer[> GOS doesn't mimic Play Services
15:57:41 <Sparty> "We're developing a minimal Play services compatibility layer as a regular app without any special privileges. The app will provide a stub implementation of the entire Play services API pretending the servers are down and the functionality is unavailable."

16:20:48 <Real[m]1> Well it suits my threat model of max privacy

16:20:57 <Real[m]1> But worried about the performance drop
16:21:10 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's mostly the cold app spawning that takes longer, but it does improve behind-the-scenes security improvements

16:52:20 <strcat[m]> justchill: user profiles act as isolated workspaces, no data sharing / communication across them, separate instance of every app, separate set of installed apps
16:52:35 <strcat[m]> justchill: the actual apk installations are global, but the app has to be separately installed in each user profile
16:53:01 <strcat[m]> so, for example, if you install Signal in one, there's a global install of Signal, but it's installed only in the one where you installed it
16:53:13 <strcat[m]> if you install it in a 2nd, then it's installed there too, but it doesn't keep a 2nd copy of the apk globally
16:53:50 <strcat[m]> justchill: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/multi-user is the extremely basic upstream explanation which applies to even much older versions of the feature

17:35:53 <rick89[m]> Hey
17:36:00 <rick89[m]> Installation done
17:36:14 <rick89[m]> I need some help here
17:36:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Kâ€‹ileXt> This bridge is really crappy, not to be rude but there is a shit tonne of spamming making the reading on telegram difficult
17:36:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Kâ€‹ileXt> Hey, whats wrong ?
17:36:28 <rick89[m]> I can't find bitwarden
17:36:32 <rick89[m]> On fdroid
17:36:39 <rick89[m]> Do they have a repo
17:37:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Kâ€‹ileXt> Yes: https://mobileapp.bitwarden.com/fdroid/
17:37:39 <rick89[m]> Thanks
17:37:49 <rick89[m]> Also anysoftkeyboard
17:38:54 <rick89[m]> I see a standard notes app on fdroid is it the official or should I use aurora one
17:39:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Kâ€‹ileXt> Openboard is nice too
17:39:54 <rick89[m]> <rick89[m] "I see a standard notes app on fd"> What about s notes
17:41:25 <rick89[m]> I see an app called s notes but not sure if it's official
17:44:05 <rick89[m]> I can't download from aurora it just says waiting
17:46:49 <rick89[m]> Ok

18:20:00 <mr_hebi_san[m]> rick89 not seeing that on my end.  I'm using the version that their website indicates is the most current f droid release (added repository to obtain it)
18:25:26 <codebam> I'm very impressed with the seamless update client. it really is seamless
18:27:16 <ulmirdin[m]> If I turn on auto reboot for updates, will my phone reboot if  I'm on a secondary user profile?
18:34:31 <wncry[m]> <ulmirdin[m] "If I turn on auto reboot for upd"> From my experience yes.
18:48:29 <strcat[m]> ulmirdin: yes the owner profile still runs so the updater still runs and notifies, but the notification is only for the owner user atm
18:48:55 <strcat[m]> ulmirdin: in theory, we could run a minimal component in other profiles which just notifies when it's done but I'd rather not build that
18:49:10 <strcat[m]> ulmirdin: makes more sense to offer an enhancement to notifications in a much more general way not hard-wired to an app
18:49:49 <rhythm[m]> <rick89[m] "I can't download from aurora it "> U should change installation method to native one..

18:51:00 <HiccupJul> re. this tweet
18:51:01 <HiccupJul> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1365341252682711043
18:52:06 <rhythm[m]> Hiw to turn off screenshot sound? Im in silent mode
18:52:11 <HiccupJul> i have a pixel 3, and i'm getting camera issues - is there some way i can make a report that will be useful?
18:52:30 <HiccupJul> or is it only really android/grapheneos developers that can help
18:52:52 <HiccupJul> i'm on the graphene os beta channel
19:01:18 <dannyknoll3[m]> A new Graphene install leaves me with two APNs with the same name(s), but different values.
19:01:29 <dannyknoll3[m]> Is this expected in any normal case?
19:04:01 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: yes
19:04:05 <strcat[m]> some carriers have multiple APNs
19:04:36 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: what camera issues? and please give a specific version that you're on, not the channel
19:04:42 <strcat[m]>  * HiccupJul: what camera issues? and please give a specific version that you're on, not the channel you get updates from
19:04:53 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: it's only useful / wanted if you're going to give specifics
19:04:53 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: Got it.
19:05:06 <strcat[m]> exactly what the problem is, how you run into it, etc.
19:05:33 <dannyknoll3[m]> Struggling with a problem where I can send/receive texts, cellular internet works, but dialing/receiving gives "Server error." Kind of running into a wall
19:06:01 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: did you turn on LTE only mode without having working VoLTE?
19:06:21 <strcat[m]> and make sure you aren't blocking the connections
19:06:22 <HiccupJul> yeah, i'll give specifics
19:06:24 <HiccupJul> give me a moment
19:06:58 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: we already undid the change that caused issues so if you're up-to-date whatever problems you encounter have no relation to that tweet / other posts about that
19:07:12 <strcat[m]> so unless you're multiple versions out of date it's not relevant
19:07:12 <HiccupJul> build number: RQ2A.210305.006.2021.03.02.10
19:07:23 <strcat[m]> yeah so it's not relevant to that
19:07:25 <HiccupJul> i see
19:07:41 <HiccupJul> it just says "Camera error" "Can't connect to the camera"
19:07:54 <dannyknoll3[m]> <strcat[m] "dannyknoll3: did you turn on LTE"> That was one of the things I found odd - I do not have that setting, and remember seeing those toggles on previous Graphene devices.
19:07:56 <HiccupJul> when I open the default camera app
19:07:58 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: have you rebooted?
19:08:08 <HiccupJul> yes, this has been going on for a while
19:08:08 <strcat[m]> there is known to be ~1% failure rate with the hardware of the camera sensor
19:08:12 <strcat[m]> not specific to Pixels
19:08:14 <HiccupJul> rebooted multiple times
19:08:27 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/googles-older-pixel-cameras-are-failing-at-an-accelerating-rate/
19:08:31 <strcat[m]> the camera sensor is probably dead
19:08:34 <HiccupJul> ah
19:08:40 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: if possible see if you can use front camera
19:08:44 <strcat[m]> if it doesn't force you to close it
19:08:50 <strcat[m]> maybe try a different camera app
19:09:06 <HiccupJul> it forces me to close it. i'll try front camera via a different app.
19:09:09 <strcat[m]> > Every Pixel camera from the Pixel 2 to the Pixel 5 has the same camera sensor (a Sony IMX363/IMX362)
19:09:20 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: the camera sensor has maybe 2% failure rate after a couple years
19:09:53 <strcat[m]> presumably it mostly breaks for people who drop their phones, get moisture into it (waterproofing isn't necessarily perfect in practice), etc.
19:10:27 <HiccupJul> i bought a partially damaged phone second hand, so yeah it could be that
19:10:36 <HiccupJul> there are small cracks in the case
19:10:57 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: basically it appears the camera sensor is a weak point and that when phones are damaged, it's one of the early things that fails
19:11:19 <HiccupJul> i see, thanks for the info
19:11:19 <strcat[m]> it's unclear if that Sony camera sensor actually has a significant failure rate itself
19:11:22 <strcat[m]> or if it's just easily damaged
19:11:30 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: it sounds like a hardware failure
19:11:38 <strcat[m]> cause we know that your install is bit for bit identical firmware, OS, etc.
19:11:55 <strcat[m]> so if it's not working post-reboot it almost has to be a hardware failure in this case
19:12:04 <HiccupJul> that makes sense
19:12:05 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: I would also try fully powering off
19:12:08 <strcat[m]> wait 30s
19:12:10 <strcat[m]> then power it back on
19:12:23 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: also totally possible the issue is a loose connection, etc.
19:12:32 <strcat[m]> opening up the phones without damaging the screen is a bit difficult though
19:12:36 <HiccupJul> well its already been left off for hours at a time
19:12:40 <strcat[m]> screen is fragile underneath
19:12:41 <strcat[m]> ah
19:13:17 <HiccupJul> this has been going on for a weeks to a few months
19:13:27 <HiccupJul> (don't ask me which :P)

19:15:17 <HiccupJul> tried four different 3rd party camera apps - all fail
19:15:17 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: this is what I'm workin' with
19:15:25 <HiccupJul> so yeah it does look like a hardware problem
19:16:03 <HiccupJul> but i guess i might as well stick to the beta channel
19:17:53 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: it might be a loose connection and got worse over time
19:17:59 <strcat[m]> but it might be a connection you can't really access
19:18:01 <strcat[m]> inside it
19:18:18 <strcat[m]> HiccupJul: probably worth extremely carefully taking apart the phone and trying to get it working by fiddling with the connector
19:18:28 <strcat[m]> but it's a lot of effort
19:18:50 <HiccupJul> yeah, it seems like it would be a pain to open up
19:19:33 <strcat[m]> dannyknoll3: try network settings reset
19:19:36 <strcat[m]> it'll lose your wi-fi networks etc
19:19:52 <HiccupJul> its not a big problem that the camera doesn't work, so i'll probably just keep using the phone as is
19:22:12 <dannyknoll3[m]> <strcat[m] "it'll lose your wi-fi networks e"> No worries, it's a fresh install anyway =]

19:39:58 <strcat> okay what's going on with this person rejoining through 200 different hosts
19:40:10 <snooopy> strcat: flood-attack on freenode
19:40:19 <strcat> strange
19:40:21 <snooopy> it's in #freenode, too.
19:40:24 <strcat> thought I'd seen that person around here
19:40:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> I was just about to complain about it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
19:41:04 <strcat> okay banned that username
19:41:09 <strcat> but it'd odd, I thought that was a real user previously
19:41:12 <snooopy> strcat: they were posting nasty ascii-art on #freenode
19:41:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Moof> The 1945 kind of ASCII?
19:42:25 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: Should I do a factory reset, and try letting it configure itself again?
19:42:25 <dannyknoll3[m]> Or is there by chance something else to try after reset network settings?
19:42:25 <snooopy> no, and I wont repeat this here because I don't want to get banned :)
19:42:27 <strcat> did they get banned and then they started spamming / using many hosts to join?
19:42:46 <strcat> dannyknoll3[m]: you could try a factory reset but I don't think it'll help
19:42:50 <strcat> dannyknoll3[m]: Verizon is kinda messed up
19:43:16 <strcat> dannyknoll3[m]: we don't include all the carrier config stuff for most US carriers atm due to it being unclear what depends on proprietary apps
19:45:04 <snooopy> strcat: Not sure, I don't see any context, it looks like ry`an started spamming first, get banned, rejoins with another host, spams again, get banned etc...
19:46:40 <strcat> snooopy: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210220#c6982370
19:46:43 <strcat> they've been active here before
19:47:07 <strcat> but it's not clear it's the same person
19:47:53 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: So perhaps I just need to manually config?

19:48:25 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: Know of anyone frequenting these parts who has Verizon?

19:48:58 <strcat> dannyknoll3[m]: a lot probably do
19:49:20 <dannyknoll3[m]> I'd check against the last Graphene Verizon phone I had configured...but it was absolutely obliterated lol
19:49:44 <dannyknoll3[m]> * strcat: So perhaps I just need to manually config? Or am I boned, ha
19:53:06 <strcat> dunno
19:58:56 <dannyknoll3[m]> I'll sniff around!
19:59:02 <dannyknoll3[m]> strcat: Unexpected to have two auto-config'd APNs and no LTE Only toggle exposed, though, right?
19:59:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> One of the things I've seen mentioned is GrapheneOS being bit for bit identical across the same device model.  Are other OSes typically not identical in this way?  In what ways would other OSes be different in a way such that they do not appear identical between the same model?
20:00:54 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: it's part of having block-based updates, verified boot, and shipping full updates for everything
20:01:41 <strcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: it's a standard thing for an AOSP-based OS doing things the proper way, i.e. not most alternate OSes, but many stock OSes have that property
20:28:25 <interesting[m]> anyone knows why there's two devices shown when editing contacts in stock graphene contacts/phone app?
20:29:19 <interesting[m]> nevermind figured out
20:32:18 <ryan[m]4> Recently installed my tmobile esim but OS keeps asking me to "login to T-Mobile"
20:32:35 <ryan[m]4> P4
20:35:36 <strcat> ryan[m]4: eSIM isn't supported yet
20:36:26 <strcat> people using workarounds like setting it up in the stock OS 1st need to realize that's not supported and like other stuff like that is unlikely to continue working
20:36:49 <strcat> we haven't developed eSIM support which involves A) making an eSIM activation app, B) setting up eSIM device configuration for each device with it
20:36:56 <strcat> neither is done, needs to be done together anyway
20:37:06 <strcat> we do not currently have someone able to work on it
20:37:12 <strcat> we have funding for it but lack of a developer
20:37:13 <ryan[m]4> strcat: yeah I actually confused this phone that has android google with a grapheneos one
20:37:17 <strcat> as with MANY other things
20:45:59 <mrbrownbadger[m]> hi. what is this?
20:47:59 <interesting[m]> <mrbrownbadger[m] "hi. what is this?"> graphene os chat
20:48:43 <mrbrownbadger[m]> wrong chat lol
21:35:35 <mr_hebi_san[m]> @Le Marchand de rÃªves : this happens to me when I try to update apps from F Droid by tapping the notification that an  update is ready.  If I actually open F Droid and update in the app directly then things work as expected
21:50:48 <bizanon[m]> Is using 4g LTE better than 5g from security point of view? Or no difference?
21:54:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <Le marchand de rÃªves> Thank you but I purchased Threema from their website so I don't know how to do it differently than click on their prompt within the app
22:15:10 <aranea> Hmm, do user profiles other than the owner profile not have access to the backup feature?
22:16:34 <aranea> the backup menu shows up in the settings app, but if I open it, it only says 'not available'
22:17:46 <aranea> I'm trying to decide rn if I'm going to use a separate profile for daily usage or just use the owner profile for that, and this seems like an important consideration
22:23:00 <chris42[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<Le marchand de rÃªves> Thank you"> I think you can download the APK from their website and then use it to update
22:35:45 <Soupman4354> is it possible for a dev of grapheneOS to be targeted into adding a bug into the code for just one specific device through a malicious update?
22:36:39 <johnk347[m]> Why so many OTA updates on pixel 3a lately?
22:37:06 <johnk347[m]> Used to be about once a month it feels like 2 a week lately.
22:37:37 <Soupman4354> like a specific targeting for malicious updates to hack a specific person?
22:44:43 <sphinx[m]> Soupman4354: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-security
22:45:00 <Soupman4354> thanks
22:47:58 <skagreek[m]> sphinx: Great read, thanks for link.
22:50:47 <dannyknoll3[m]> skagreek: If you haven't read GrapheneOS.org in its entirety, do yourself the favor
22:50:47 <dannyknoll3[m]> God-status
22:50:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <johnk347[m] "Used to be about once a month it"> grapheneos.org/releases
22:53:36 <Soupman4354> so then if a hypothetical attacker knew the IP, they could send a malicious update? probably not possible with modern DHCP or VPNs.
22:56:41 <dannyknoll3[m]> No. Well, they may be able to send one. The phone won't accept it as a signed GrapheneOS update, though.
22:57:11 <Soupman4354> even if they had access to the servers?
22:57:52 <TheJollyRoger> Soupman4354: As stated on the website, the update server is not a trusted third party. Updates to GrapheneOS are signed by Daniel Micay and verified on the phone itself. Even if an unauthorized third party had control of the update servers, the phone would not accept its updates.
22:58:14 <Soupman4354> ok. Thank you so much!
22:58:48 <TheJollyRoger> Soupman4354: similarly, no identifying information is sent to the server. From the project's end all the devices look the same. It isn't possible for us to target any device specifically with a malicious update.
22:59:13 <Soupman4354> Ok cool.
23:04:05 <strcat[m]> johnk347: there's a changelog at https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
23:05:04 <zzxx123_> even if they had access to the servers? > DM stores the signing key somewhere else
23:05:46 <TheJollyRoger> zzxx123_: even if they had access to the servers. The keys don't live there.
23:07:00 <zzxx123_> yea otherwise its  meaningless
23:07:01 <strcat[m]> the builds and signing are obviously not done on a server
23:07:12 <strcat[m]> please read the documentation linked above
23:07:18 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
23:07:24 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
23:07:33 <zzxx123_> Right that's what I said
23:07:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ah, whoops, sorry zzxx123_
23:07:53 <TheJollyRoger> Didn't realize you were quoting XP.
23:18:35 <j-james[m]> Is it possible to revert to the stock Pixel firmware from the phone after installing GrapheneOS?
23:19:07 <j-james[m]> Or is it the kind of thing where someone would need to find a Pixel ROM from online and flash it again?
23:20:48 <strcat[m]> the stock factory images are published
23:20:53 <strcat[m]> this is covered in both installation guides
23:21:07 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
23:21:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
23:21:32 <strcat[m]> the web installer provides a web-based implementation of the necessary command for removing the flashed verified boot key
23:21:39 <j-james[m]> Whoops, I only checked the FAQ, apologies
23:21:57 <j-james[m]> That's what I was looking for thanks
23:52:22 <strcat> seems we're being spammed again
23:52:25 <strcat> via PMs
23:52:27 <strcat> sigh
23:56:57 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: same here, I'm getting it too.
