00:32:49 <sliplov9[m]> Is there a reason why "GrapheneOS" isn't the only message displayed when starting up? Trying to get my extremely privacy + security oriented grandmother on GrapheneOS, and she's 95% sold, but being the conspiracist that she is, she's skeptical about "GOOGLE" being shown during start-up, even after I tried to explain to her likely reasons for it being the case that don't involve active google spyware. Is there any
00:32:49 <sliplov9[m]> reason for why this hasn't been taken out?
00:35:49 <rny> sliplov9[m]: we cant take out the google words, its baked into the hardware ROM
00:36:02 <rny> it is normal.
00:36:29 <rny> same reason why when you boot grapheneos the yellow warning is displayed
00:36:46 <rny> rest assure, AVB is still doing its thing
00:38:52 <sliplov9[m]> Alright, so there's no way around it? I had no worries of it being problematic, just problems convincing my grandmother of that
00:39:38 <sliplov9[m]> I'll give her the explanation you provided me with. Hopefully it gets across better than mine was able to
00:39:40 <rny> sliplov9[m]: no, unless we fab our own chips
00:40:08 <snooopy> sliplov9[m]: Maybe it helps if you try to tell your grandmother this is the last thing that indicates that the device has been manufactured by google?
00:40:43 <sliplov9[m]> Oh that's good advice! That might just work
00:40:56 <rny> a privacy + security oriented grandmother
00:41:03 * rny applauds
00:41:11 <snooopy> rny: yeah, love it. :)
00:42:52 <sliplov9[m]> Yeah, but its borderline tinfoil hat. She did get super excited about the project once I told her about it though! I'm planning on getting her set up this with a new pixel this week
00:43:54 <rny> so as long as she doesnt think that 5g transmits sars-cov-2, i think its healthy
00:47:44 <sliplov9[m]> Oh man, compared to that its a huge win. Hard to believe there's people out there who genuinely hold related beliefs (haven't heard of that one specifically, but I wouldn't doubt it).

01:01:28 <rny> i need to update the list
01:07:54 <curios12345[m]> <rny "curios12345: https://renlord.com"> Thank you. Could you also help me with the other questions?
01:10:26 <rny> orbot + vanadium
01:11:06 <rny> check orbot tor circuits
01:11:16 <rny> on whether they use the same exit node
01:11:34 <rny> creating multiple users/profiles gives each profile isolation
01:11:56 <rny> apps are isolated to the profile they are installed into
01:13:48 <rny> the only risk that I am aware of RE: usage of SIM/mobile network is that your location is given away using cell triangulation (depending on the laws of your country)
01:14:01 <rny> this is also how emergency services can roughly locate where you are when you are in distress
01:14:45 <rny> how this can be abused depends on which country you reside and the ethics of your government
01:15:37 <rny> there is not much of a correlation between closed source hardware components w.r.t security and privacy.
01:16:23 <rny> qualcomm is committed to maintaining their devices and it is repeated mentioned that they are a leading vendor when it comes to pushing security updates for their hardware
01:17:45 <rny> on android software specific security issues, graphene os pushes out aosp security patches very quickly (if not on the day of official release), so your OS is as secure as it can be (if not more so with the additional hardening that is also implemented)
01:18:01 <rny> curios12345[m]: do you have anymore questions?
01:19:05 <snooopy> RE: sim/mobile network: iirc you can disable any sim communication by enabling airplane-mode.
01:21:31 <curios12345[m]> Thank you really so much for all the answers.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
01:22:27 <curios12345[m]> <rny "curios12345: do you have anymore"> If you don't mind me asking do you personally use orbot to navigate? And I wanted to know if you would call yourself a cyberpunk?
01:25:18 <rny> curios12345[m]: no i do not use orbot to navigate. I dont necessarily identify as a cyberpunk, but am consistently mindful of the security and privacy implications of using 3rd party services.
01:26:38 <rny> i'm quite pragmatic about things in general
01:26:51 <curios12345[m]> What do you use for surfing? answer only if you want to
01:27:33 <rny> curios12345[m]: depends, i use Tor/VPN/clearnet when surfing

08:33:25 <MrJed> Hi all. I'm thinking about getting a second phone just to use with GrapheneOS. Used Pixel 3a phones seem really reasonably priced on eBay. Is it a bad idea? The docs say not to get an older device.
08:35:09 <jonmonty[m]> If you can afford it the pixel 4a is also very cheap and will have a longer support life, at least a year
08:35:18 <jonmonty[m]> New they're only 350
08:35:30 <MrJed> For a new one, you mean?
08:35:37 <MrJed> Is it a bad idea to buy used?
08:35:39 <take_a_deep_brea> MrJed: right now pixel 5 and 4a 5G are in testing and mostly will  have the longest support. 4a is still the most economical option with the longest support
08:36:43 <jonmonty[m]> <MrJed "Is it a bad idea to buy used?"> No its a good idea just know what your getting into and don't buy a Verizon model. The phone I'm typing on rn is a pixel 4 xl I got used for only 500 dollars and it's in perfect condition
08:40:21 <MrJed> Sounds like a pixel 4a is the sweet spot for the price conscious then. (The 3a is going for ~ $100 unlocked on eBay.)
08:41:15 <jonmonty[m]> <MrJed "For a new one, you mean?"> Yes new its 350 which is a pretty good deal honestly two members of my family got them and love them. I'm sure they're available much cheaper used but I havnt checked. Just make sure you don't buy a Verizon model with the bootloader unlock switch greyed out. On those models you will not be able to flash custom software which basically defeats the whole purpose of buying a pixel
08:41:21 <take_a_deep_brea> MrJed: 3a will not be supported for much longer . less than a year if i remember correctly
08:42:02 <MrJed> Okay, cool. Thanks everyone!
08:44:05 <somenerd[m]> You might want to read the faq
08:44:16 <somenerd[m]> Includes a lot of good info :)

12:58:01 <ChrisWolf> Hi everyone. I am completely new to this level of tech. I have just loaded GrapheneOS onto my Pixel 3a. I am using Collabora Office apps which I obtained directly from the Collabora website. I would like to find a cloud service (for backing up files) that doesn't require Google Play Services or Google Mobile Services to work. Does anybody have any

14:19:20 <frontman[m]1> I'm trying to find a solution for a device password that is strong but can be typed one handed with the right thumb. With the default keyboard on the load screen, caps and special characters are out of reach. Is there a way to customize the keyboard on the load screen?
14:38:08 <nscnt[m]> frontman: I haven't found such settings for the AOSP keyboard after a quick search. You'll need to find a keyboard that you can customize in this way.
14:38:39 <fll[m]> <somenerd[m] "Nextcloud doesn’t have e2ee afai"> It does with a plugin and their (desktop) apps. Obviously not via browser
14:40:19 <frontman[m]1> nscnt: I tried some custom keyboards but they only turned on after the lock screen.
14:41:12 <nscnt[m]> Right. Only services that are needed for the bootup gets loaded before the first authentication.
14:41:47 <frontman[m]1> Buddy and I have been trying Nextcloud and our complaint is that all chat logs are visible on the server. We went to using Session when Signal went down Friday and so far its excellent for text chat.
14:42:21 <sierocharlie[m]> <frontman[m]1 "Buddy and I have been trying Nex"> Session?
14:42:34 <nscnt[m]> However, I think if the app is made the way it should be, it can be available at the startup, too. Not too sure about that, though.
14:42:42 <frontman[m]1> @sierocharlie: its a signal fork
14:43:22 <sierocharlie[m]> Right, can it connect to signal servers as well?
14:43:57 <frontman[m]1> I'm not sure.
14:44:31 <Albakham[m]> It's supposed to be decentralised, p2p
14:44:43 <Albakham[m]> * It's supposed to be decentralized, p2p
14:44:44 <frontman[m]1> Session uses onion routing so each instance is a new chat string

14:45:40 <Albakham[m]> Yeah 😅

18:49:02 <sierocharlie[m]> How do I add another account?
18:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hi sierocharlie[m] just tap "SETTINGS -> System -> Multiple Users" and switch it to "ON" first.
18:51:14 <TheJollyRoger> Then you can add them via "Add User"
18:51:58 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks!
18:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> You can optionally give the new user the ability to use the phone and recieve SMS calls if you so wish (ie: let's say you are doing a GrapheneOS high security setup, where you ONLY use the owner account for provisioning system-wide changes, and otherwise leave it inactive)
18:52:39 <TheJollyRoger> Note that this *does not affect* the other users' ability to use Data or Wifi.
18:53:20 <TheJollyRoger> So it's quite possible to use this to do some extremely wierd things like have your unencrypted insecure calls and texts go to one account, but Signal messages go to another.
18:54:26 <TheJollyRoger> It's quite versatile.
19:01:24 <st23> .
19:17:04 <sierocharlie[m]> Thanks. It works. I was looking wrong. I am using a high security set-up. Owner > Regular Use > Not private

20:49:28 <user73629[m]> wait, that version works for you?
20:49:28 <banjo[m]> just installed this. works warns about missimg play services but works ok.
20:49:53 <user73629[m]> Strange, did you have to enable a split install or something?
20:49:53 <banjo[m]> the same
20:50:32 <banjo[m]> did u use auror store?
20:50:44 <banjo[m]> * did u use aurora store?
20:51:43 <user73629[m]> Yes, I keep getting this:

20:52:52 <user73629[m]> I wonder if this may be a seedvault issue given I also get that popup, although ive cleared reddits storage many times without issue.
20:54:09 <banjo[m]> reset the phone and try again maybe?
20:54:25 <user73629[m]> Good idea
20:55:44 <banjo[m]> better yer try slide. official app is full of ads, spyware and much shittier overal
20:55:59 <banjo[m]> * better yet try slide. official app is full of ads, spyware and much shittier overal
20:57:23 <banjo[m]> for more issues ask here #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:58:06 <banjo[m]> this place is more for floks trying to install grapheneos
21:00:53 <user73629[m]> Thanks. Its still broken so Im probably just gonna use slide if thats all I can do. Its an excuse to not use that cancerous website as much I suppose.
21:02:54 <grouch80[m]> banjo: The button you indicated in the second photo isn't there. Also, in your picture, there is  what appears to be a flash button for the third button. On mine it is a HDR button.
21:08:03 <banjo[m]> grouch8.0: maybe try resetting the phone. it worked on stock?
21:09:23 <theychuckthisfro> Time I install Graphene.
21:09:24 <theychuckthisfro> Wish me luck.
21:10:07 <banjo[m]> what phone?
21:10:39 <banjo[m]> theychuckthisfromyou:
21:11:28 <theychuckthisfro> Pixel 3a.
21:11:48 <banjo[m]> good luck
21:13:45 <grouch80[m]> Do you mean reset to stock OS? I purchased the phone on EBay and only did updates before loading GOS.
21:14:23 <JerrynDev[m]> <theychuckthisfro "Pixel 3a."> Gl
21:15:34 <theychuckthisfro> Wait, should I update the phone before doing this?
21:15:47 <theychuckthisfro> It says I only have 1.9 GB of Memory left.
21:16:01 <banjo[m]> grouch8.0: no. reset grapheneos
21:16:27 <banjo[m]> theychuckthisfromyou: erase all and update to the latest
21:16:48 <banjo[m]> follow along
21:16:59 <banjo[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install
21:20:10 <grouch80[m]> What's the easiest way to do this?
21:24:06 <theychuckthisfro> Do I just force stop apps to free up memory?
21:24:16 <strcat> theychuckthisfro: there's no reason to do that
21:24:43 <strcat> the memory requirements on the install page is about the memory on your computer
21:24:48 <strcat> and cached memory doesn't matter
21:25:09 <theychuckthisfro> Oh.
21:25:20 <theychuckthisfro> No, I definitely meet the requirements.
21:26:13 <causasui> is it intended that only admin users can enable ADB or is this user error on my part?
21:26:56 <strcat[m]> only the owner profile can enable adb
21:27:01 <strcat[m]> adb being enabled is not a per-profile thing
21:27:08 <strcat[m]> also adb is a development tool for app and OS developers
21:27:13 <strcat[m]> it's not intended for other usage
21:29:33 <causasui> Yeah I was using it to get big media files onto the phone, but I recognize that is not exactly the intended purpose
21:30:27 <causasui> subquestion: how would you (or anyone here) recommend sharing files between profiles?
21:31:28 <theychuckthisfro> These updates take forever.
21:39:38 <theychuckthisfro> When it talks about connecting the phone, all I need to do is plug it into the computer with my USB-C to USB-A cable, right?
21:49:32 <causasui> when what talks about connecting the phone?
21:52:39 <theychuckthisfro> Nevermind.
21:52:54 <theychuckthisfro> What option do I choose when I power the phone on while holding the volume down button?
21:53:02 <theychuckthisfro> Restart Bootloader?
21:53:49 <mynacol[m]> None. You connect it to the PC
21:54:49 <theychuckthisfro> Why is my PC not recognizing it?
21:55:18 <theychuckthisfro> Nevermind, it got it.
21:55:29 <mynacol[m]> Nice
21:55:37 <tobsn[m]> GrapheneOS is perfect
21:55:45 <tobsn[m]> Good work
22:01:01 <theychuckthisfro> mynacol: When I'm downloading the version for the 3A?
22:01:26 <theychuckthisfro> Do I change the command that's listed in the installation to include the link used?
22:01:49 <gullhaar> Blackberry and Android11 has some news regarding Black Berry Spark Suite, can someone elaborate what it will achieve?
22:03:56 <strcat> gullhaar: seems quite offtopic for this channel and BlackBerry is all branding/marketin
22:04:01 <strcat> marketing*
22:04:13 <gullhaar> copy, thanks
22:05:15 <strcat> in reality BlackBerry has garbage privacy/security and the phones with their brand are just from a low end state-owned Chinese OEM (TCL) licensing their brand
22:05:37 <gullhaar> yeah, blackberry isnt what it used to be
22:05:45 <strcat> BlackBerry Mobile is owned by the Chinese government
22:05:50 <strcat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Mobile
22:05:54 <strcat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCL_Technology
22:05:55 <gullhaar> so its bad news then
22:06:10 <strcat> everything labelled BlackBerry should be avoided
22:06:30 <gullhaar> as far as I can see, its the android 11 "workspace" option
22:06:36 <strcat> gullhaar: the Canadian company literally backdoors their encryption
22:06:43 <strcat> and gives governments keys to intercept
22:06:53 <strcat> it's not a conspiracy theory - it's publicly known fact
22:07:06 <strcat> and their only E2E encryption is backdoored by design too
22:07:09 <gullhaar> yeah everything china owned is like that atleast
22:07:09 <strcat> just avoid anything they do
22:07:24 <strcat> gullhaar: I mean the still independent company does this
22:07:30 <strcat> they sold their mobile devision to the Chinese gov
22:07:40 <strcat> the rest of the company still exists and makes apps/services which are backdoored by design
22:07:53 <strcat> they're scum as far as I'm concerned
22:07:57 <strcat> always have been, really
22:08:11 <theychuckthisfro> Do I download the .zip and the .zip.sig?
22:08:18 <strcat> theychuckthisfro: follow the official guide
22:08:22 <theychuckthisfro> For my phone version?
22:08:24 <strcat> don't download / extract *anything* on your own
22:08:27 <strcat> follow the official guide
22:08:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> On android-security the only devices listed with HSMs are Pixels and Samsung S20. Why do all of the other OEMs just use the generic one and not develop their own?
22:08:35 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install
22:08:50 <strcat> hypokeimenon[m]: they don't use a 'generic' one, they don't have one
22:08:52 <strcat> TrustZone is not an HSM
22:09:10 <strcat> dunno what list you're talking about
22:09:12 <theychuckthisfro> strcat: No, I am.
22:09:19 <strcat> theychuckthisfro: okay so follow what it says
22:09:33 <strcat> when you get to the point that you're supposed to obtain the factory images
22:09:36 <strcat> get them the way it says with curl
22:09:49 <theychuckthisfro> I am.
22:09:50 <strcat> really important otherwise it's your responsibility to put the stuff in the right place
22:10:02 <theychuckthisfro> I was just asking if I change the last part for the version that's my model.
22:10:20 <theychuckthisfro> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sunfish-factory-2021.01.05.03.zip
22:10:26 <theychuckthisfro> This is the command I'm talking about.
22:11:10 <theychuckthisfro> I was asking if I just change it to the Sargo Factory file instead.
22:12:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> strcat https://www.android-device-security.org/client/datable?sortBy=patchlevel&order=-1&fbe=file&sba=true
22:14:04 <hypokeimenon[m]> * strcat https://www.android-device-security.org/client/datatable?sortBy=patchlevel&order=-1&fbe=file&sba=true
22:45:08 <theychuckthisfro> Do I have to install the .sig file along with the .zip?
22:46:41 <strcat[m]> theychuckthisfromyou: just follow the guide
22:46:54 <strcat[m]> you don't have to do anything it doesn't say to do
22:47:04 <strcat[m]> and in fact, should not do anything it does not say to do
22:47:11 <theychuckthisfro> Don't worry, I'm following it.
22:47:16 <strcat[m]> don't open anything it doesn't say to open etc
23:09:07 <theychuckthisfro> It worked.
23:15:13 <theychuckthisfro> Is Vanadium the Chromium engine used in Graphene?
23:15:35 <grouch80[m]> Alright, I tried a reset and I still can't switch to the rear camera.
23:23:41 <theychuckthisfro> How would I install applications off the Play Store without needing to access it?
23:23:58 <theychuckthisfro> I don't want to have to use a Google account.
23:24:26 <jonmonty[m]> Install the aurora store from f Droid
23:25:35 <jonmonty[m]> It will create an anonymous account and allow you to download apps from the GPS. Do be aware it is better to use a free alternative to that app if you can find it on f droid since most play store apps have trackers
23:28:14 <theychuckthisfro> I thought some people were wary of F-Droid.
23:30:05 <penguin1> hey could someone please help me install graphene os on my pixel 4xl

23:36:35 <strcat[m]> as long as it boots to the bootloader menu it's fine
