01:14:37 <borisdpython> hello frens. I haven't tried to jailbreak a phone in many years. I am stuck. I am trying to do the web-based installed and I can't get my device state unlocked
01:15:08 <akrugosei[m]> Try the other method out
01:16:19 <borisdpython> ok that seems complicated AF I'll give it a go though
01:17:03 <akrugosei[m]> It's really not, just take a deep breath before you start and before you know it, you'll have your new is installed.b
01:17:15 <akrugosei[m]> Os*
01:18:03 <Ted36> Hi I'm trying to flash my phone and the web browser wont detect it
01:18:07 <borisdpython> ok cool thanks for the encouragement I just saw how long it was and felt like this shit must take all day
01:18:14 <Ted36> "Error: No device selected."
01:18:14 <borisdpython> I'll give her a shot
01:18:18 <Ted36> its a pixel 4a
01:19:26 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <borisdpython "hello frens. I haven't tried to "> What actually happens?
01:21:20 <borisdpython> It just keeps telling me device is locked I see nothing anywhere to unlock my device even though I enabled OEM unlocking
01:23:14 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Interesting.  What is the phone, and did you purchase it new?  Refurbished?
01:23:26 <Ted36> When i try to unlock the bootloader, in the browser it says no compatible devices found.
01:23:41 <mr_hebi_san[m]> From a carrier, or from a store like best buy?  from the manufacturer?
01:24:20 <Ted36> ah we are stuck on the same step
01:24:38 <borisdpython> Mine is brand new Nokia 7.2 just brought it home, this is the first thing I want to do is get google off of it
01:24:52 <borisdpython> I bought it direct from Amazon unlocked carrier
01:25:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Is Nokia supported?  I have to look
01:25:37 <borisdpython> oh I just assumed all android devices were...didn't even think it may not have been
01:25:42 <mr_hebi_san[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
01:25:48 <strcat> borisdpython:  there is no 'jailbreak' involved
01:26:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> > GrapheneOS has official production support for the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 4a.

These devices meet the stringent privacy and security standards and have substantial upstream and downstream hardening specific to the devices.
01:26:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> The Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 aren't currently supported. The Pixel 4a 5G is poorly named and isn't really a variant of the Pixel 4a. It shares more in common with the Pixel 5 and our existing Pixel 4a support isn't relevant to it.

01:26:49 <strcat> borisdpython: one of the requirements is for devices to properly support installing another OS including supporting all hardware-based security features for it
01:27:27 <borisdpython> Ok got it so I'm probably just dead in the water here
01:27:41 <borisdpython> Thanks for your help everyone!
01:27:43 <strcat> there isn't official support for that device
01:27:50 <strcat> and it probably doesn't support installing another OS
01:27:55 <strcat> let alone doing it with all security features working
01:28:20 <strcat> otherwise you'd have been able to unlock it but you wouldn't be able to install GrapheneOS onto it anyway
01:28:44 <borisdpython> Ah I see...
01:28:51 <strcat> since you'd have to first develop a port to it and it won't meet the requirements for official support
01:34:44 <Ted91> Alright I just re booted and finished installing a windows update
01:34:49 <Ted91> same issue with my phone
01:34:51 <Ted91> any suggestions?

01:56:49 <Ted8> that's not a debug log. Thanks for being condescending
01:57:23 <strcat[m]> Ted8: is it working fine now?
01:57:46 <Ted8> Im not sure
01:57:50 <Ted8> I'm on the fastbootd menu
01:57:53 <strcat[m]> Ted8: which step are you on
01:58:05 <strcat[m]> watch progress in browser
01:58:11 <strcat[m]> it should show that it's doing stuff
01:58:14 <Ted8> Flashing factory images
01:58:29 <strcat[m]> is it showing that progress is happening?
01:58:42 <Ted8> yes
01:59:15 <Ted8> screen went black, progress bar is still moving in browser
02:02:41 <Ted8> looks like its working
02:02:46 <Ted8> thanks mr. strcat
02:03:31 <strcat[m]> Ted8: it will eventually say it's finished after it boots back to the main bootloader menu and then you just need to do the final locking step
02:03:43 <Ted8> Yup did that. Connecting to wifi now
02:08:42 <Ted8> So I have it working now
02:09:29 <Ted8> how do I install apps?
02:09:40 <Ted8> what section of the website covers that? I'm over looking it
02:10:30 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Are you familiar with installing downloaded apks, sideloading, and the like?
02:12:02 <Ted8> Ish
02:12:12 <Ted8> eh lets go with no
02:12:56 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Going too deep on this would be better for the Off Topic channel.  Are you on there?
02:14:30 <mr_hebi_san[m]> But a good starting point would be to open Vanadium and go here https://f-droid.org/
02:15:40 <Ted8> I don't believe I am
02:15:45 <Ted8> I will check that out
02:17:42 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <Ted8 "I will check that out"> https://matrix.to/#/#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org there you go :)
02:18:35 <Ted8> its wanting me to make an account
02:18:49 <Ted8> il DM you
02:19:18 <Ted8> JK I cant even do that
02:19:23 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I made an account just to talk on here.  It's a neat place.
02:19:38 <Ted8> i may have to. I wish I had more free time
02:20:35 <sphinxcat[m]> mr_hebi_san: they are on IRC
02:20:42 <sphinxcat[m]> so #grapheneos-offtopic
02:21:26 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Thank you for clarifying.  That's the # next to his username, right?
02:21:50 <mr_hebi_san[m]>  * Thank you for clarifying.  That's the # next to his username (in matrix), right?
03:19:54 <lucaszanella[m]> I compiled grapheneos, ran correctly in the emulator. I then built the emulator myself. Now I'm trying to run grapheneos from this emulator I built. I pointed all the .img files generated from grapheneOS compilation but the -kernel option is missing. I know grapheneOS have some prebuilt kernels, but I couldn't find the prebuilt kernel for the choosecombo release aosp_x86_64 userdebug. Anyone knows which kernel
03:19:54 <lucaszanella[m]> should I point?
03:21:16 <lucaszanella[m]> I tried kernel-ranchu but it got rejected
03:28:54 <strcat[m]> lucaszanella: we just use the aosp one
03:29:20 <strcat[m]> lucaszanella: we don't do kernel development for non-officially supported targets
03:30:07 <lucaszanella[m]> strcat: yes, I used and it's good, but I was just trying to learn. Didn't you ever try to run the emulator by specifying the .img files?
03:31:17 <strcat[m]> lucaszanella: prebuilts/qemu-kernel ?
03:31:53 <strcat[m]> prebuilts/qemu-kernel/x86_64/5.4
03:39:00 <lucaszanella[m]> <strcat[m] "prebuilts/qemu-kernel/x86_64/5.4"> thanks, I think it might be it. ` ./emulator -help-disk-images` says that I should do this: `./emulator -sysdir $DIR_OUT/system -datadir $DIR_OUT/data -kernel $QEMU_KERNEL_x86_64 -ramdisk $DIR_OUT/ramdisk.img -system $DIR_OUT/system.img -data $DIR_OUT/userdata.img -cache $DIR_OUT/cache.img -vendor $DIR_OUT/vendor.img`. This is what I did, but I get `emulator: ERROR:
03:39:00 <lucaszanella[m]> No AVD specified. Use '@foo' or '-avd foo' to launch a virtual device named 'foo'`. It does not say how to disable AVD and I couldn't find this option. I even tried commenting the `return 1` after this error. It goes further but then gives `Segmentation fault`. Do you perhaps know how to run with custom .imgs?
04:11:11 <lucaszanella[m]> For context: I usually develop inside VMs. But emulator inside a VM is very slow. I'd like to run the emulator on the host machine and build grapheneos inside a vm
04:15:22 <hypokeimenon[m]> Graphene OS in a Qubes VM would be the dream.
04:18:33 <warmjuice[m]> how about the other way around?
04:19:05 <lucaszanella[m]> emulating any android on qubes would be great
06:28:15 <nazgulc[m]> When i switch to other profiles; I don't see the message body in drop down... I have to always go to the messaging app to check the content..

12:04:25 <NewPerson> Hello - I'd be grateful for some help installing GrapheneOS. I've been using the Web install method, and have now got to the "flashing factory images" step - the webpage has been saying "Finding latest release" for over an hour now - is that a normal wait time?
12:07:50 <deappledapple> Not really, is the factory image downloaded on https://grapheneos.org/install/web#obtaining-factory-images
12:11:55 <NewPerson> Yes, I've downloaded coral-factory-2021.02.07.17.zip release.
12:14:27 <deappledapple> If you're not on incognito, try ctrl+f5, then press flash release
12:14:36 <deappledapple> To refresh the usb connection
12:16:55 <NewPerson> that doesn't seem to have done anything, could this be because I am on a mac?
12:17:35 <somenerd[m]> maybe refresh the page and retry the install?
12:21:54 <NewPerson> I've refreshed the page, but it seems stuck connecting to the device, which it did fine before...
12:28:35 <deappledapple> Already tried on other USB ports or cables?
12:51:20 <hobo0000[m]> I see people talking possible hardware backdoors on YouTube. I dont belive those but how do you answer to that claim
12:52:08 <hobo0000[m]> * I see people talking possible hardware backdoors on Pixels with grapheneos. I dont belive those but how do you answer to that claim
13:01:46 <take_a_deep_brea> hobo0000: can you link to this discussion ?
13:02:25 <take_a_deep_brea> hobo0000:  tell them to give a frickin link to the backdoor documentation , lmao
13:05:16 <hobo0000[m]> No just read comments on TheHatedOnes Grapheneos video :D I dont think they have any source just thinking
13:12:09 <rny> They are welcome to report said backdoors to Google and get paid.
13:13:31 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
13:14:03 <hobo0000[m]> xD
13:16:51 <take_a_deep_brea> in an indirect way we already pay for getting potential (backdoors/bugs) fixed . why else do we get only three years on these devices ? qualcomm has to keep updating firmware
13:33:07 <ciano> hello , I am following web install guide . which fastbooth driver should I install for windows10? thank s
13:41:55 <take_a_deep_brea> ciano:  i am not on Windows myself but the driver should be available as optional updates for windows
13:42:52 <take_a_deep_brea>  * ciano:  i am not on Windows myself but from what i have seen here previously , the driver for fastboot should be available as optional updates for windows
13:48:57 <bethefriction[m]> I'm trying to restore a backup from a USB on another user profile but it says back up is not available. Is this not possible?
15:19:41 <motovate[m]> <ciano "hello , I am following web insta"> I didn't need to install a driver using Win 10 Pro
16:07:12 <m2tu[m]> what can the reason be that when i edit i.e device.mk file and remove bluetooth module files the phone works and can be bootlocked also, but when in userdebug the phoen keep on grapheneos screen wont boot ?
16:47:53 <doittoit[m]> Just got my pixel phone, updated all Win10 drivers and pixel drivers. From here on, can you estimate how long a typical GOS install will taken for a novice?
16:48:29 <somenerd[m]> you can use the web install
16:48:29 <somenerd[m]> instead of cli
16:49:12 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
16:49:17 <doittoit[m]> somenerd: nice. That sounds like the better way since I'm newbie.
16:51:14 <doittoit[m]> somenerd: just wondering on time estimates. 1 hour, 3 hours, or more?
16:51:31 <somenerd[m]> I'm not too sure
16:51:32 <somenerd[m]> sorry
16:53:37 <deep_breath> doittoit[m]:  it depends on your computer specs but not too much . best to set aside a couple hours and go about it by thoroughly reading the installaton site
16:53:54 <somenerd[m]> you don't need to read much?
16:54:00 <somenerd[m]> they're using the web installl
16:54:03 <somenerd[m]>  * they're using the web install
16:54:08 <deep_breath> if all goes well it shouldnt be more than twenty minutes
16:56:02 <akrugosei[m]> <deep_breath "if all goes well it shouldnt be "> I agree, I was unsure prior to installation because of how lengthy the process looked, but within 20 minutes I had the os installed.
16:58:56 <doittoit[m]> akrugosei: deep_breath thanks a lot. Whew, that sounds great. I will give it a shot following all instructions.
17:01:00 <take_a_deep_brea> doittoit:  best to give https://grapheneos.org/install/web
17:01:03 <akrugosei[m]> Take it one step at a time, read each step, apply it and get back to us within 20 minutes lol
17:01:37 <akrugosei[m]> Skip reading, jump a step and you'll more than likely be in for trouble.
17:01:57 <take_a_deep_brea> a shit first
17:02:21 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao , a shot first
17:02:25 <doittoit[m]> akrugosei: I will take the next 20mins to get everything in position and then will start
17:03:58 <akrugosei[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "lmao , a shot first"> Lol I thought you really meant otherwise
17:05:11 <take_a_deep_brea> no o
17:05:39 <take_a_deep_brea> typo and thanks to element&matrix
17:05:57 <take_a_deep_brea> couldnt fix on time

17:51:00 <doittoit[m]> Just bought this supposed to be unlocked phone
17:51:35 <somenerd[m]> well, you have to try unlocking it
17:51:45 <somenerd[m]> it's locked by default (even if it is unlock able)
17:51:49 <somenerd[m]>  * it's locked by default (even if it is unlockable)
17:51:52 <doittoit[m]> oh
17:52:12 <somenerd[m]> go through the steps
17:52:26 <somenerd[m]> if it still doesn't work, then there probably is a problem
17:52:45 <doittoit[m]> Which steps? Are there posted "unlocaking steps"
17:52:56 <doittoit[m]> *unlocking
17:53:06 <somenerd[m]> it should be there on the site?
17:53:50 <doittoit[m]> It says "Next, go to Settings ‚ûî System ‚ûî Advanced ‚ûî Developer options and toggle on the 'Enable OEM unlocking' setting. This requires internet access on devices with Google Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection."
17:54:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah
17:54:04 <somenerd[m]> check that
17:54:19 <somenerd[m]> if that is grayed out or something, then there's a problem
17:54:25 <doittoit[m]> I tuned "On" Developer Options, but nothing was asked of me from Google Play. Do I initiate a factor reset now?
17:54:37 <doittoit[m]> Developer Options is enabled
17:54:45 <doittoit[m]> But i never did a factory reset
17:54:59 <somenerd[m]> I think you have to set OEM unlocking
17:55:09 <somenerd[m]> and unlocking the bootloader resets the phone anyways
17:55:47 <doittoit[m]> Im in the Fastbood Mode screen. It says in green, "Device status: locked"
17:55:55 <somenerd[m]> yeah
17:56:00 <somenerd[m]> it should be like that

18:03:21 <doittoit[m]> new cable, same error
18:03:39 <doittoit[m]> are there some drivers I need for Win10 to recognize my phone?
18:04:03 <nscnt[m]> doittoit: Have you updated the Android Bootloader Interface driver, too? If you're in the bootloader interface and connected to the pc, go to Windows Updates and search for updates. After that there might be "View optional updates" where you'll find a driver update.
18:05:48 <nscnt[m]> On some systems it's not even an update, but a first-time install.
18:07:22 <doittoit[m]> nscnt: The bootloader interface is not an option on my Win10.
18:07:41 <doittoit[m]> nscnt: No, I have not updated the Android Bootloader interface driver
18:09:01 <nscnt[m]> Uhm, unsure what you mean... If your phone is in the bootloader interface and your phone is connected to the pc do what I wrote.
18:10:52 <doittoit[m]> My PC says drivers are updated
18:11:33 <nscnt[m]> You were searching updates in Windows Updates? Not some device manager window?
18:11:41 <doittoit[m]> "view optional updates" looked grayed out
18:11:56 <doittoit[m]> I am now updated them all
18:12:25 <doittoit[m]> Says I have to restart my PC now
18:12:50 <doittoit[m]> Do I unplug the USB and restart my PC?
18:12:58 <nscnt[m]> Were you installing regular Windows updates?
18:13:14 <doittoit[m]> Yes, just regular windows updates.
18:13:17 <doittoit[m]> Noting for Pixel
18:13:25 <nscnt[m]> You wouldn't need to reboot if you just updated the optional driver.
18:14:14 <nscnt[m]> Well, just go for it for now. We will see after that
18:14:41 <doittoit[m]> yo yo yo It worked!
18:14:52 <doittoit[m]> No restarting Win10 needed
18:15:13 <nscnt[m]> Yea,  that's just for the other updates probably
18:15:57 <nscnt[m]> Glad it's working c:
18:16:32 <nscnt[m]> It's a little messy with all the different operating systems and distributions, because they all have their quirks
18:16:57 <doittoit[m]> With you all helping this is really alot easier than I imagined
18:17:04 <doittoit[m]> MUCH APPRECIATION
18:17:11 <nscnt[m]> WebUSB-based installer makes it a little easier, but it can't help with driver or cable issues
18:17:16 <nscnt[m]> doittoit: No problem
18:21:13 <doittoit[m]> says "Downloaded coral-factory-2021.02.07.17.zip release." Shows a full blue bar. Move on to "Flass Release" now?
18:22:22 <nscnt[m]> I guess ^^
18:22:56 <doittoit[m]> here it goes
18:33:38 <m2tu[m]> is there anyway to edit startup logo  from build ?
18:33:50 <m2tu[m]> don't find bootanim files anywhere
18:37:56 <take_a_deep_brea> m2tu:  the google one ?
18:38:15 <m2tu[m]> boot google one and graphene
18:40:57 <take_a_deep_brea> m2tu: google one cannot be removed as its part of firmware
18:45:13 <m2tu[m]> and graphene one where to search for it in build tree ?
18:47:32 <take_a_deep_brea> dont  know bout that. sorry .
18:47:42 <m2tu[m]> ok
18:49:47 <doittoit[m]> Im back ... stuck on _LOCKING THE BOOTLOADER. I have this message "Error: Bootloader was not locked, please try again!"
18:50:08 <doittoit[m]> I dont see how to "set the bootloader to locked"
18:50:24 <doittoit[m]> Before I click on the button at Web Install
18:50:53 <nscnt[m]> doittoit: You need click the button on the web installer and then confirm it on your phone. Did you try it that way?
18:51:38 <doittoit[m]> nscnt: Yes, I tried it that way. When I click the web installer button, nothing happens to my phone, I only see this message on the Web Installer "Error: Bootloader was not locked, please try again!"
18:52:06 <nscnt[m]> doittoit: Are you still in the bootloader interface on your phone?
18:52:16 <doittoit[m]> Factory images are confirmed at Flashed
18:52:40 <doittoit[m]> nscnt: Yes, I am still on the bootloader interface
18:52:48 <Lighwake[m]> You should be able to select "lock the bootloader) with your volume buttons and then confirm by clicking the power button.
18:53:16 <doittoit[m]> lighwake: That option does not exist. Only "Restart Bootloader"
18:53:30 <Lighwake[m]> * You should be able to select "lock the bootloader" with your volume buttons and then confirm by clicking the power button.
18:54:02 <Lighwake[m]> Does it say on the interface whether it is locked or unlocked?
18:54:22 <doittoit[m]> It says "Device state: unlocked"
18:55:13 <Lighwake[m]> And clicking the volume buttons doesn't trigger anything right?
18:56:07 <doittoit[m]> Clicking the volume buttons gives me several options: Restart Bootloader, Start, Poweroff, Barcode, Rescue Mode, Recovery Mode,
18:56:56 <doittoit[m]> Wierd
18:57:19 <doittoit[m]> I clicked on the Web Interface again and it worked!
18:57:34 <doittoit[m]> It already confirmed it was Flashed.
18:58:02 <doittoit[m]> I clicked loacking the bootloader 2xs, it failed, then just clicked it again and it randomly locked.
18:58:43 <Lighwake[m]> Yeah, it should have initiated the request to lock the bootloader the first time you clicked. I guess something was not right.
18:59:47 <doittoit[m]> Wow ... much expectation ... now I see GrapheneOS loaded
18:59:52 <doittoit[m]> !
19:00:17 <Lighwake[m]> Welcome on board!
19:00:53 <doittoit[m]> lighwake: nscnt Many thanks again for navigating this. I simply would never have tried GOS without this board.
19:01:04 <take_a_deep_brea> doittoit:  awesome
19:01:32 <nscnt[m]> c:
19:04:05 <doittoit[m]> Location Services??? Allow apps that asked my permission? Is this recommended?
19:07:27 <nscnt[m]> doittoit: Doesn't matter. Apps that want to use location always need to ask for permission and the location services are limited on GrapheneOS anyway (because there's no implementation yet).
19:09:06 <take_a_deep_brea> doittoit: strongly suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/faq
19:09:27 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/usage
19:10:13 <doittoit[m]> Got it. Thanks.
19:58:32 <puerh> I just got my Pixel 5 in the mail, where can I find the release to flash?
19:59:26 <lodtank> afaik there is none, pixel5 isn't supported
20:00:41 <puerh> I thought there was an experimental build as of 4 days ago
20:01:00 <lodtank> i don't know about that, perhaps someone else here knows more, i'm no dev:)
20:01:54 <puerh> RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.07.17 claims to have experimental support for the 5 but idk if I just directly flash that or need a specific pixel 5 build
20:03:42 <alex-resist> puerh as long as there's no stable build here https://grapheneos.org/releases please don't flash anything
20:03:51 <alex-resist> Worst case you might brick your phone
20:04:03 <puerh> Im well aware of the risk, I would like to flash it
20:04:14 <alex-resist> puerh there is no build for the Pixel 5. There is nothing to flash
20:04:58 <Lighwake[m]> <puerh "RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.07.17 cl"> For now you can flash Calyx without microG if you want more privacy than stock. I believe they support pixel 5.
20:16:14 <m2tu[m]> is it possible to force packageinstaller from source to just install apks on external sdcard partition ?
20:18:50 <bethefriction[m]> I'm new to graphene and wondering if its possible to restore a back-up of the main profile to another user profile using a USB? When I tried, it says back up option not available
20:51:57 <auto_warmbeer[m]> wuhan lab
21:52:41 <mulbr[m]> puerh: check with anupritaisno1 , i think there is some test builds for the 5
21:53:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat louipc ban strlcpy (guy's trolling)
21:54:18 <strlcpy[m]> trolling?
21:54:40 <strlcpy[m]> i am an openbsd guy so i thought strlcpy was appropriate
21:55:51 <strlcpy[m]> i mean, we've already got strcat here
22:00:16 * jakewise[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MgIWwTPZosqulWuMvRqUGlVd/message.txt >
22:01:29 <jakewise[m]> wup... wait a second. the phone just popped up.
22:02:31 <jakewise[m]> ok. moving forward now. that was weird
22:03:09 <blkqi> good writeup tho
22:03:12 <blkqi> ;-)
22:13:03 <jakewise[m]> Thx. Looks like I have the "GrapheneOS" logo on the phone. YEAH!
22:13:34 <Publius> congrats, welcome aboard!
22:13:59 <jakewise[m]> üëçÔ∏è
22:24:52 <zzxx123> Argh matey!
22:36:26 <strcat[m]> lighwake: please don't promote that OS here, thanks
22:38:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: btw could you also prevent glassrom from being promoted here
22:38:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Too much misinformation being spread about what the project is here
22:38:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then that ends up on reddit somehow
22:39:38 <TheJollyRoger> Aye sir, will consider those topics embargoed then.
22:44:19 <Blackbeard> Greetings fellow voyagers
22:46:11 <Blackbeard> Question: Does the calendar app work in graphene or is this a know bug?
22:53:17 <Dave256> Hi, first time here. I recently installed GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a. This was my fist attempt ever and it went very smoothly and I thought I had completed every step. However, when I turn the phone on I get a message that the bootloader is unlocked. I understand that is a big problem. How can I lock the bootloader? Thanks
22:53:52 <strcat> Dave256: it's covered in https://grapheneos.org/install/web
22:54:01 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#locking-the-bootloader
22:54:26 <strcat> the guide goes out of the way to try making sure you don't stop after flashing since at that point the install isn't completed
22:55:14 <Blackbeard> Dave256: you can use the web install interface to relock the bootloader
22:55:52 <Dave256> Ok, Thanks for your help. I appreciate it!
22:56:36 <strcat> Blackbeard: the Calendar app works fine for the intended purpose: testing a Calendar backend, which the OS doesn't provide out-of-the-box
22:57:17 <strcat> it's the AOSP Calendar app, it's an app for testing the OS, not for end users to use
22:57:52 <Blackbeard> @strcat: so it will not allow me to add dates. Is that normal?
22:57:53 <strcat> and people are welcome to work on the issue we have about making it not user facing
22:58:00 <strcat> Blackbeard:  it's not supposed to do that
22:58:09 <strcat> Blackbeard: my response explains it
22:59:44 <Blackbeard> strcat: ok, i installed the Eta calender app over the top and it would not add dates either...now makes sense...
23:00:31 <Blackbeard> @strcat: sorry should have said 'Etar'...
23:00:56 <strcat> Blackbeard: the built-in app doesn't provide interfaces for adding events, etc.
23:01:14 <strcat> Blackbeard: it has support for that but it doesn't provide a UI for it
23:01:19 <strcat> it's for automated testing not users
23:01:37 <strcat> there's an enhancement issue open on our tracker about making it not user-facing
23:01:47 <Blackbeard> What is a calendar app you would recommend to use?
23:01:52 <strcat> or replacing it, but there doesn't appear to be a viable replacement
23:01:57 <strcat> I don't have a recommendation
23:02:08 <strcat> Etar works fine, that's not a recommendation of it, I'm not familiar with their codebase
23:02:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Blackbeard: this chat is for OS discussion. You can ask about apps in OT
23:02:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Etar is a good calender
23:03:40 <Blackbeard> ok,will move there, but Etar does not work in graphene as i cannot add dates
23:04:13 <bethefriction[m]> strcat: is it possible to restore a back up onto a user profile other than the owner?
23:05:30 <strcat[m]> I don't think Seedvault supports multiple user profiles yet
23:05:34 <strcat[m]> Seedvault isn't developed by us
23:05:40 <strcat[m]> you should ask them
23:18:06 <bethefriction[m]> Oh I see. When I tried it just tells me that back up is unavailable in the other profile's settings. Thanks.
23:25:48 <alex-resist> I've had Transportr (public transportation app by Torsten Grote) break today when I accidentally clicked some "export to calendar" function today
23:26:27 <alex-resist> I haven't tried to reproduce it yet but my gut feeling is that it happened because of the very limited calendar functionality
23:26:46 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: if the app breaks without a calendar backend available, it's broken on AOSP too
23:26:51 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: so report a bug to the app, not us
23:27:07 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: supporting Android means supporting what the CTS/CDD define as Android
23:27:18 <strcat[m]> Android does not have to include a default available calendar backend
23:27:24 <strcat[m]> AOSP does not, and passes CTS
23:27:25 <alex-resist> Yeah, I didn't investigate it any further, just wanted to mention it. What you say makes sense
23:27:29 <strcat[m]> so, that's a bug in the app, report it to them
23:27:44 <strcat[m]> if you don't report it to them, they won't know, and won't fix it
23:27:58 <strcat[m]> app bugs need to be reported to the app developers
23:30:09 <alex-resist> I see, I guess very few people know that the existence of a calendar should not be expected
23:32:19 <alex-resist> Or, to be technical, MUST not be expected
23:32:47 <strcat[m]> the only thing Android guarantees is that there's basic support for viewing events, etc. but there is no requirement to have a backend by default
23:36:41 <strcat[m]> the plans for providing optional support for installing a Play services compatibility layer are being altered due to lack of community interest
23:38:05 <alex-resist> strcat "play services compatibility layer" = microG as an app?
23:38:46 <strcat[m]> no we had plans to offer 2 approaches
23:39:34 <strcat[m]> it's currently on the home page of the site and about to be cut down to 1 planned approach
23:39:50 <alex-resist> Ok sorry, I missed that
23:39:59 <strcat[m]> well, it's being cancelled
23:40:12 <alex-resist> Had to take a break of about 6 weeks, I still have to catch up
23:41:39 <strcat[m]> I have looked into what would have to be done to turn microG into something we could build, sign and publish for this
23:41:53 <strcat[m]> and it would be an enormous amount of work to make it acceptable for our needs
23:42:09 <strcat[m]> and I've looked at the timelines for their support of new major OS versions and it's not pretty
23:42:23 <strcat[m]> we'd essentially need to fork it and put more resources into it than it already has
23:42:45 <strcat[m]> and this will always be a fragile hack that doesn't guarantee apps keep working since they can expand their usage of Play services to more APIs at any time
23:43:00 <strcat[m]> it's not something we're going to be able to do
23:43:09 <strcat[m]> the 2nd approach is not cancelled, and that will be the focus
23:43:13 <strcat[m]>  * the 2nd approach is not cancelled, and that will be the focus for this
23:43:22 <strcat[m]> of course, our main focus is running apps without these kinds of hacks
23:44:39 <strcat[m]> if there had been substantially more interest from the community it would be different but I'm not going to be dedicating my time to forking microG to turn it into something much different or funding that
23:44:47 <strcat[m]> so this has to be cancelled based on lack of community support for it
23:45:00 <strcat[m]> it has serious security issues and limitations as is
23:45:18 <strcat[m]> we can't support it even as an optional feature since apps will trust it the way they trust Play services
23:45:22 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't provide the same security
23:45:31 <strcat[m]> so it's inappropriate for our usage without a substantial fork
23:52:43 <Thatcher[m]> Screw microG
23:54:12 <Thatcher[m]> That's how I feel about it
23:57:22 <strcat[m]> well, anyway, that proposal has been looked into and won't be happening
