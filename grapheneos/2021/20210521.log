19:28:16 <rawtaz> holy cow, what are you doing :>
19:28:20 <shibboleth> that's.... useful?
19:28:23 <strcat> This room will continue to the exist for the time being but we're fully migrating to Matrix without a bridge to Freenode: #grapheneos:matrix.org #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org. We reserved #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat but we'll be focusing on Matrix.
19:28:25 <strcat> After you move to #grapheneos-new:matrix.org / #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org (or the libera.chat IRC channels, but keep in mind they aren't bridged to the main rooms) you can leave here.
19:28:27 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
19:28:29 <strcat> If your Matrix client has the previous aliases cached with the old rooms, use #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org as a workaround.
19:28:31 <strcat> if enough people are interested in the libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic rooms we'll figure out a leaner way to bridge it without having a bridge bot requiring mod powers in the Matrix room to invite/kick virtual irc users and kick Matrix users for lurking (really bad experience).
19:28:33 <strcat> There will be nothing beyond spam telling people to move to the new rooms here. We'll be focusing on the Matrix rooms.
19:28:56 <strcat> rawtaz: telling people to go to Matrix or at least the libera.chat channel
19:29:04 <strcat> every time 4-5 people move
19:29:39 <rawtaz> strcat: i want to give you a friendly thought/feedback - dont take this as critisism. i think that you dont need to put so much effort into "managing" this channel (or well, its equivalent when its gone). communities, including this one, have a part self regulation, but regardless of that, i think youre spending a bit too much of your time focusing on the management aspect. you *can* take it a bit more chill :)
19:30:06 <strcat> I'm pasting something
19:30:09 <rawtaz> yeah. but like, if you hadnt done that, whats the harm. they will move sooner or later anyway. there's no point in pushing the last ones over. either they come by themselves, or they arent interested anyway :)
19:30:36 <rawtaz> strcat: i am only sharing *friendly* thoughts because i care. please dont take this as an attack or critisism.
19:30:51 <strcat> rawtaz: they don't know
19:30:55 <rawtaz> im not saying you are doing something wrong, im just saying that you dont have to be as much on your toes :)
19:31:20 <rawtaz> even if they dont, they will the day they stop idling, so that shouldnt be a problem
19:31:39 <strcat> I think some people would want to know freenode was taken over and their NickServ data and any further messages can be seen by those people
19:31:40 <autoprime> This 9th ping has gotten me to join on Libera. Damn your pings lol
19:31:50 <strcat> https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ev8y/freenode-open-source-korea-crown-prince-takeover
19:31:59 <rawtaz> yes. but they will know eventually. it's entirely clear by the topic and youre recurring messages
19:32:29 <rawtaz> you do what you want with your time of course, im just trying to snap you out of some unnecessary work hehe. all well though. cheers
19:32:44 <strcat> when freenode implodes and the channel is just entirely gone people won't be able to see it at all
19:33:14 <rawtaz> when that happens, they will obviously just go to the grapheneos website and find where to join. it's not a problem.
19:34:03 <strcat> you have too much confidence in people
19:35:08 <rawtaz> hey, maybe you're right
19:35:34 <rawtaz> and maybe at the same time you have too little, think about it :)
19:35:50 <rawtaz> hm i always thought that i had no confidence at all in a lot of folks :o
19:35:50 <strcat> I can see it made multiple people move
19:35:56 <rawtaz> sigh
19:35:57 <strcat> mostly to Matrix, some to libera.chat
19:37:23 <mark4o> i think most of us here are well aware that it has moved to Matrix; just don't have time to learn and set up a new chat client right now, maybe next week
19:37:35 <rawtaz> thats one reason indeed
19:38:24 <strcat> I could post the web client links
19:38:28 <wschlich> /!\ THIS CHANNEL HAS MOVED TO IRC.LIBERA.CHAT #LIBERIA /!\
19:38:31 <wschlich> /!\ IRC.LIBERA.CHAT IS THE BEST IRC NETWORK /!\
19:38:34 <wschlich> /!\ THE JEWS HAVE TAKEN OVER FREENODE, CHATS HAVE MOVED TO IRC.LIBERA.CHAT /!\
19:38:48 <strcat> btw those are false flag spambots
19:38:55 <strcat> pretending libera.chat is spamming here
19:38:57 <strcat> to make them look bad
19:39:16 <strcat> it's going to get worse
19:39:29 <strcat> maybe someone just sabotages it and corrupts / wipes the db
19:39:30 <kamyl9> /!\ THIS CHANNEL HAS MOVED TO IRC.LIBERA.CHAT #LIBERIA /!\
19:39:33 <kamyl9> /!\ IRC.LIBERA.CHAT IS THE BEST IRC NETWORK /!\
19:39:36 <kamyl9> /!\ THE JEWS HAVE TAKEN OVER FREENODE, CHATS HAVE MOVED TO IRC.LIBERA.CHAT /!\
19:39:53 <strcat> I can probably make that stop
19:39:59 <bitd> well
19:40:01 <rawtaz> strcat: we are intelligent enough to understand that. i thikn you are underestimating people a bit. is that possible?
19:40:05 <bitd> at least they're pointing people in the right direction
19:40:10 <rawtaz> you dont have to make that stop. it's not a problem that you need to solve
19:42:49 <strcat> rawtaz: well probably solved now
19:43:31 <strcat> I would prefer getting people to move before this just devolves in spambots posting links to gore and ascii image memes
19:43:59 <bitd> tru
19:44:01 <bitd> matrix is better
19:44:04 <bitd> you can just embed the gore
19:44:07 <bitd> no need to click links
19:47:06 <strcat> rawtaz: got 500 people to move, that's pretty good
19:47:37 <rawtaz> yeah thats not bad
19:48:02 <rawtaz> FWIW i think libera chat staff are working pretty hard on matrix integration
19:48:06 <strcat> only 27 ppl on the libera.chat channel
19:48:14 <strcat> rawtaz: we aren't using that matrix.org IRC bridge though
19:48:18 <strcat> it's horrible
19:48:29 <strcat> it kicks users for not posting for 30 days
19:48:35 <rawtaz> oh right that was the thing, you wanted something else than where there is now
19:48:42 <strcat> and it leaves a bunch of virtual users in the channel for irc users that are gone
19:48:50 <strcat> it doesn't ever flush those out
23:58:32 <edsh[m]> Hi guys and girls:
23:58:32 <edsh[m]> I love GrapheneOS and it is my daily driver. However, some friends of mine asked me if CalyxOS would be better option. I always respond like this: Graphene build upon the security level of Android. Like it uses additional security levels. CalyxOS uses the Android security level.
23:58:34 <edsh[m]> Is this correct?
23:59:03 <edsh[m]> Where can I find more about the security level of CalyxOS?
