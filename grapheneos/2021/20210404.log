00:09:37 <akc3n> @LevelUp: GrapheneOS has entirely automatic background updates. Please read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates Also, there is no need to download factory images again. Seedvault is included as an OS backup service (must be explicitly enabled) BTW.  Also, just an FYI, GrapheneOS has downgrade protection, which the link includes information about it as well.
00:10:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!LevelUp> it's worked out.  Thanks alot
00:11:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> No problem!Remember you only should follow "Replacing GrapheneOS with stock ROM" only if you are going to get rid of GrapheneOS, since that part makes you replace the Verified Boot Keys with stock's, which is not a really good idea when you are going to keep GrapheneOS.
00:11:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!LevelUp> 👌
00:12:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> You still must follow the rest of the post-installation part.

03:32:03 <Volkoz[m]> sad to see techlore community have to criticize this 😪
03:32:04 <Volkoz[m]> ya'll have been through quite a lot
03:32:20 <Volkoz[m]> * sad to see techlore community criticize this 😪
03:32:20 <Volkoz[m]> ya'll have been through quite a lot
03:58:06 <TheJollyRoger> Volkoz[m]: it's been a rough time, alright, that's for sure...
04:05:42 <strcat[m]> Volkoz: there is an overview of what it actually does at https://attestation.app/about
04:06:17 <strcat[m]> uses hardware-based attestation to verify device firmware and OS authenticity / integrity
04:06:27 <strcat[m]> and verifies the identity of the device
04:06:38 <strcat[m]> (based on the hardware keystore key it makes)
04:07:14 <strcat[m]> and chains trust to the app via verified boot / attestation to perform software level checks which cannot simply be faked without an attacker having deeply exploited the OS in the current boot
04:07:53 <strcat[m]> the reason you run it on a 2nd device is because it doesn't trust the application / UI layer
04:08:13 <strcat[m]> or the OS itself
04:08:28 <strcat[m]> if a malicious OS is on the device it can't fake the results
04:09:04 <Eddy[m]> So am I really supposed to by another pixel to check my current one
04:09:41 <Eddy[m]> What if the pixel used to check the other is also insecure due to tampering?
04:10:21 <Eddy[m]> * So am I really supposed to buy another pixel to check my current one
04:14:35 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: GrapheneOS has an in-house attestation server that can take the place of the second Pixel, or you can use any device that's running Android 7 and up to do it.
04:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: all you need, is another device, be it a desktop, a laptop, or another Android 7 phone or later that you trust enough to not lie about the attestation data that it gets from your Pixel.
04:16:29 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <TheJollyRoger "Eddy: all you need, is another d"> It's Android 8.0 or later now
04:16:39 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, whoop, thanks DHFuchsiaOSwhen
04:17:07 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <TheJollyRoger "Oh, whoop, thanks Degoogled, Har"> It's a relatively recent change
04:17:22 <TheJollyRoger> Sounds like!

04:18:42 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks.
04:19:36 <timetravelingman> What if GrapheneOS was really the friends we made along the way?
04:19:58 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <timetravelingman "What if GrapheneOS was really th"> Lmao
04:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> Eddy[m]: ideally, you would use multiple devices to check the attestation data or ask people you know, with the rationale being that the more audits you get, the harder it's going to be for a Very Persistent Adversary to compromise them all.
04:20:12 <timetravelingman> Maybe real security is having an open mind and love in our hearts
04:20:25 <TheJollyRoger> timetravelingman: Well, I've often liked to say the reason I came to this community, is becasue I was searching for a phone. The reason I stayed, is because I found friends.

16:35:51 <rawtaz> yo. i have a "problem".. i recently bought a brand new Pixel 4a, and immediately installed grapheneos on it (all i did in the original OS was to unlock it so i could install graphene). after using it for like a week, the other day i noticed that only the right one of the two speaker holes at the bottom actually make any sound. the left one never makes any sound.
16:36:59 <rawtaz> ive tried this with vanadium playing youtube sound, soundcloud.com and also a bunch of apps from f-droid. nothing makes the left one sound in any way. so now im wondering if this could be due to grapheneos, or if perhaps this (budget) model doesnt have a left speaker, or if you think it may be broken?
16:56:35 <battlepad[m]> Lmao fam rawtaz only the right speaker has sound
16:57:13 <battlepad[m]> To clarify:
16:57:13 <battlepad[m]> Top speaker AND bottom right speaker shoot out sound
16:57:52 <battlepad[m]> Its perfectly normal, all pixel 4a's are like that. The left side speaker is just cosmetic
17:04:04 <b1101> curious. I noticed the 3.30.02 update has yet to reach the stable channel. have there been issues found? usually updates go stable shortly after beta
17:15:56 <rawtaz> battlepad[m]: that's good, thanks! :D i guess it's a budget thing and the real 4 (not 4a) has speakers in both positions? honestly i would have expected that if they have only one speaker, they close the other hole, but i guess they didnt want to do that

20:49:52 <strcat[m]> sounds like you were following an official guide
20:49:58 <Guest75104> correct
20:50:01 <Guest75104> to the letter
20:50:11 <strcat[m]> that has led to these errors due to having messed up third party / obsolete drivers and/or platform-tools
20:50:18 <strcat[m]> try to remove everything they had you do
20:50:19 <strcat[m]> and reboot
20:50:22 <strcat[m]> then use the web installer
20:50:34 <Guest75104> on PC?
20:50:36 <strcat[m]> it's possible they had you run their third party adb and it's still running as a service
20:50:37 <strcat[m]> yes
20:50:41 <TheJollyRoger> Guest75104: If the ADB server is still running, it will interfere with the web installer.
20:50:42 <strcat[m]> the problem is on your computer not the phone
20:50:44 <jj1013[m]> <Guest75104 "and whenever i do CLI it tells m"> Keep in mind using CLI will not do any better. WebUI is always easier.
20:50:45 <strcat[m]> phone is fine
20:50:52 <jj1013[m]> And more stable.,
20:51:18 <strcat[m]> so, remove as much of the stuff as they had you install as possible, reboot, remove anything else if necessary
20:51:22 <strcat[m]> then use the web installer
20:51:26 <Guest75104> used Android Flash Tool WebUI to restore
20:51:31 <Guest75104> and it worked
20:51:34 <strcat[m]> you don't need to do that
20:51:41 <Guest75104> any suggestions on removing adb?
20:51:46 <strcat[m]> just use our web installer after removing whatever this stuff was
20:51:49 <strcat[m]> remove what you installed
20:51:50 <Guest75104> we talking ust delete files?
20:51:54 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you installed
20:51:54 <strcat[m]> and reboot
20:52:05 <strcat[m]> if you ran an installer, run the uninstaller
20:52:06 <Guest75104> Platform tools
20:52:09 <strcat[m]> if you extracted files, remove that stuff
20:52:11 <Guest75104> direct from android
20:52:11 <strcat[m]> remove it all
20:52:17 <jj1013[m]> Somebody deleted a message of mine.

20:53:08 <TheJollyRoger> Guest75104: if you used a "minimal adb" or a "third party adb" package, then you're going to need to figure out how to uninstall it with the uninstaller, in case it's running a service on your computer. If you downloaded the official platform tools from Google, then you just erase the folder you unzipped.
20:53:39 <strcat[m]> Guest75104: do that, reboot, use web installer, that's all

20:54:10 <Guest75104> hm yeah did that too; will web installer work from Pi?
20:54:29 <strcat[m]> suggest just using it on the computer you already started on
20:54:40 <strcat[m]> just remove all the stuff you did with third party guides and reboot the computer
20:54:41 <strcat[m]> that's all
20:54:53 <strcat[m]> try the web installer, then if you have issues not covered in the guide, ask for help
20:54:54 <TheJollyRoger> Hi @Phenix0, huh, I've never heard of that happening before, hope someone else might be able to answer for you.
20:55:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​henix0> Yep, so do I

20:58:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​henix0> It is off, yes
21:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> huh. Very odd!
21:01:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​henix0> I'll go once again through the permissions and the Do Not Disturb settings, just in case I missed something

21:50:18 <TheJollyRoger> Guest34165: With respect to the Commandline install, you need to be using Powershell, your pathing must be set, and "fastboot --version" must return 31 or greater. If fastboot --version doesn't return that, either your pathing isn't set, you're not using powershell, or you've downloaded an out of date version.
21:50:42 <Guest34165> it did
21:50:54 <Guest34165> i tried both CMD and Powershell
21:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Can you paste me the output of "fastboot --version" please?
21:51:03 <Guest34165> --version returned 31.x.x
21:51:30 <Guest34165> no cuase i removed it all as recommended from previous chats
21:51:40 <Guest34165> recommended i remove all ADB tools
21:51:43 <Guest34165> and reboot
21:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> With the web installer, you're not in Incognito mode, correct?
21:52:03 <Guest34165> but i installed 31.0.1
21:52:08 <Guest34165> no
21:52:11 <Guest34165> no incog
21:52:11 <jj1013[m]> What is the error you get on WebUI?
21:52:31 <southron[m]> I had that problem on 1 install. I ended up having to edit a file in a text editor.  Unfortunately I can't remember the details.
21:52:38 <TheJollyRoger> He's getting "Array buffer allocation failed."
21:52:38 <Guest34165> Error: Array buffer allocation failed
21:53:18 <Guest34165> attempting on edge now
21:53:36 <Guest34165> this is new unlocked device too; actually bought just to do this
21:53:37 <TheJollyRoger> southron[m]: I highly recommend not doing that, that safety check is there to prevent an incorrectly versioned distribution of fastboot from flashing the wrong partition and leaving the device unbootable.
21:53:46 <jj1013[m]> That could work if it is the so-called Edge Chromium.
21:53:47 <TheJollyRoger> Guest34165: We'll get you onboard.
21:53:57 <Guest34165> cool cool
21:54:36 <Guest34165> confusing that Powershell and CMD would tell me that my SDK is out of date when i work to manual flash using flash-all
21:54:46 <Guest34165> i followed the CLI to the T
21:54:52 <Guest34165> so i thought id try the web
21:55:20 <TheJollyRoger> I'm a tad bit surprised as well.
21:55:20 <TheJollyRoger> However, remember that I'm not there sitting over your shoulder, so even though you've said "I've done everything right" I have no way to doublecheck that.
21:56:31 <Guest34165> lol yeah
21:56:33 <Guest34165> i hear you
21:57:16 <jj1013[m]> <Guest34165 "so i thought id try the web"> It is a good choice, governor. WebUI happens to be more stable and easier to use.
21:57:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
21:57:28 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <P​henix0> Not yet. I'll do that next
21:57:34 <Guest34165> not a noob to CLI or roms etc; normally TWRP;
21:58:28 <Guest34165> but open to advice; guidance. thanks all
21:59:01 <TheJollyRoger> Guest34165: just another quick sanity check, you're on Windows 10, correct? I know that Edge was released on older versions of Windows, but some of our guys have reported installation from older versions of Windows was extremely spotty.
21:59:21 <Guest34165> correct; windows 10
22:00:14 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I'm trying to narrow down causes. This problem's still affecting you on Edge as well?
22:00:32 <Guest34165> chromium edge; installing now... ill report back
22:00:58 <TheJollyRoger> Fingers crossed!
22:01:03 <Guest34165> seems to repeat some installation steps but i DONT touch it
22:01:04 <Guest34165> !
22:01:17 * TheJollyRoger scoots to the edge of his seat.
22:01:32 <Guest34165> lol
22:02:27 <Guest34165> writing vendor boot
22:02:58 <Guest34165> ok now onto fastbootd menu
22:03:06 <Guest34165> here is where i normally error
22:03:45 <Guest34165> bummer
22:04:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. You're using the Google branded cable, right?
22:04:35 <Guest34165> no, i dont have usb C on my laptop
22:04:40 <TheJollyRoger> Just going through my "list of potential problems and causes" and trying to mark off stuff.
22:04:45 <Guest34165> but i am using an ANKER data usbA-usbC
22:04:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do you have an Anker or Aukey USB cable?
22:04:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ok,
22:04:52 <TheJollyRoger> gonna cross that one off...
22:04:58 <Guest34165> :)
22:05:21 <TheJollyRoger> But just in case might try a couple other slots just to see if it's the slot, not the cable.
22:05:27 <Guest34165> i hear you; troubleshooting says find whats common, change a variable see if the problem changes or follows
22:05:30 * TheJollyRoger puts a strikethrough through "cable?"
22:05:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:05:33 <Guest34165> did that too
22:05:35 <Guest34165> same result
22:05:37 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
22:05:44 * TheJollyRoger puts a strikethrough through "USB slot?"
22:05:47 <Guest34165> thanks for shovelling thru this with me
22:05:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, you're welcome!
22:06:08 * TheJollyRoger is thinking.
22:06:24 <Guest34165> "unpacking system"
22:06:54 <TheJollyRoger> It's locking up at "Unpacking system?"
22:07:29 <Guest34165> no just slow
22:07:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just be patient
22:07:38 <strcat[m]> Guest34165: did you remove everything you downloaded and reboot the computer?
22:07:39 <Guest34165> writing system
22:07:45 <Guest34165> yes
22:07:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not interact with the device unless instructed to do so
22:07:48 <strcat[m]> Guest34165: okay sounds like it's working
22:07:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> It takes a while
22:08:06 <Guest34165> it usually errors after; standing by
22:09:57 <TheJollyRoger> Woah hold on a sec did we just lose Chanserv?
22:10:38 <Guest34165> still writing, still paitient
22:10:57 <TheJollyRoger> (Sorry, chanserv is unrelated to this, please disregard)
22:11:43 <Guest34165> writing system ext
22:12:46 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta step away from my desk for a bit, sorry >_<.
22:13:33 <Guest34165> writing vendor
22:13:35 <Guest34165> np
22:16:04 <Guest34165> Error: Unable to claim interface.
22:16:18 <Guest34165> ok she errored out after writing the vendor and restarting
22:16:31 <Guest34165> im now back to the original bootloader
22:21:07 <Guest34165> Error: Unable to claim interface.
22:22:57 <TheJollyRoger> Guest34165: I think it's saying that the USB interface is currently in use. Can you close the other browser windows, unplug the phone, and plug it back in?
22:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> See if this changes anything?
22:23:30 <TheJollyRoger> A while back I remember there was a bug that required the phone to be hotplugged (unplugged, then plugged back in the same way).
22:23:33 <Guest34165> so this chat is in chrome;
22:23:53 <Guest34165> and edge was where i was trying the reload
22:23:56 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know if it's this but it looks like we're getting a different result so something is changing...
22:24:28 <TheJollyRoger> I gotta head off again, unfortunately, can't stay at my seat at the moment.
22:24:34 <Guest34165> roger
22:24:43 <Guest34165> i may just have to restore to original
22:24:50 <Guest34165> and return
22:24:55 <Guest34165> :(
22:25:08 <Guest34165> thanks Jolly
22:25:17 <TheJollyRoger> Guest34165: Please don't lose heart yet!
22:25:33 <Guest34165> lol how do we pick this up with continuity
22:25:45 <TheJollyRoger> You could try it on another computer, sometimes that's helped some of our guys.
22:25:59 <Guest34165> i can borrow a friends from scratch
22:26:05 <Guest34165> maYBE A mac
22:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> Since the root of trust in GrapheneOS is the security chip and the remote attestation from it, as long as you can use attestation.app to verify the authenticity of the keys, the installing computer is to an extent somewhat distrusted.
22:26:44 <Guest34165> the only other computer i have is a raspberry pi
22:26:54 <Guest34165> ill need to try a friend
22:26:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! Give it a try on another computer, and then you can use Auditor, and pairing with the attestationserver at attestation.app to verify the authenticity.
22:27:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:27:33 <Guest34165> will do; name is jeremy
22:27:48 <Guest34165> so if we link up again maybe that helps
22:27:51 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck, Jeremy. This is a really unfortunate setback, but don't lose hope.
22:28:00 <Guest34165> roger wilco
22:28:00 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, see you soon. Come back anytime, or feel free to idle in the channel!
22:28:09 <Guest34165> kk see yougain soon
22:28:17 * TheJollyRoger rushes for a pot that's rapidly boiling over
22:33:54 <Fragaria[m]> strcat: i think i found a slanderer
22:34:47 <strcat[m]> please bring up moderation stuff in private message
22:35:05 <strcat[m]> don't draw more attention to trolls, etc. here
22:35:20 <Fragaria[m]> strcat: alright
22:35:40 <Fragaria[m]> I'll pm you
22:37:22 <bentley> i'm confused about importing a ca certificate. or maybe about properly generating one.
22:38:33 <bentley> i generated a cert with 'openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048' and 'openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem'
22:38:44 <bentley> then signed a certificate with it
22:39:16 <bentley> added myCA.pem to /etc/ssl on a couple of servers and they accept the certificate signed with it
22:39:37 <bentley> tried to import myCA.pem in grapheneos, and got an error
22:39:46 <bentley> "Private key required to install a certificate"
22:40:27 <bentley> i don't understand why the *private key* would be a requirement for installing a ca certificate. am i missing something?
22:43:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Guest34165: hey, you here?
22:44:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> I might be able to help you while Peter is out
22:44:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Do you have another Android phone with a USB-C?
22:45:28 <bentley> 16:29 -!- Guest34165 [4c78d52a⊙chvcn] has quit [Quit: Connection closed]
22:45:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Oh, ok
22:46:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !. has joined the Telegram Group!
22:46:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!.> Hey
22:46:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!.> can someone help me ?  I don't get any notifications from WhatsApp and Signal.  why is that?
22:46:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Also, Bentley, sorry to hear about your problem, but I am not knowledgeable enough
22:48:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hi, GrapheneOS doesn't include Google Play Services, and therefore apps that rely on Google's push notifications implementation suffer
22:48:18 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Signal should work properly tho
22:48:38 <strcat[m]> WhatsApp will work if you enable the background connection feature and give it a battery optimization exception
22:48:53 <strcat[m]> get the non-Play-Store WhatsApp and enable that
22:51:48 <mefistofeles> is there some kind of website or forum where one can review these recommendations for popular apps?
22:51:58 <mefistofeles> I mean, for GrapheneOS, of course
22:53:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> mefistofeles: that's off-topic, let's discuss it there
22:53:38 <mefistofeles> sure
23:05:11 <sizzyb> so I'm in the 'Unlocking Bootloader' phase. I think my computer isnt recognizing my pixel
23:05:22 <sizzyb> i have a pixel 4a and running Windows 10
23:06:29 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> sizzyb: try checking Windows update
23:06:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> There might be a driver that it needs to auto-install
23:06:59 <sizzyb> yes all up to date, including optional drive
23:07:39 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Is your phone OEM unlocked?
23:08:01 <sizzyb> affirmative.
23:08:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Is it on the fastboot mode?
23:08:44 <sizzyb> it is on Fastboot Mode
23:09:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Are you using the official usb C-to-C cable which came with your Pixel?
23:09:35 <sizzyb> affirmative
23:10:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Is there any adapter connected to it or is it directly connected to your computer?
23:10:57 <sizzyb> It's directly connected. my cpu has a USB-C port, and I'm using the C-to-C cable provided from google
23:11:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Hmm, interesting, try to reboot your pc
23:11:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> 𝔰𝔥𝔞𝔯 𓂀 (@s​harmouta) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:11:57 <sizzyb> I'm going to Restart Bootloader on my phone. I never connected my phone to the CPU before. that may be the problem.
23:12:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> That wouldn't hurt)
23:13:21 <sizzyb> still not recognizing it. makes the noise that something is plugged in, but phone doesnt show on This PC at all... gonna restart the computer
23:14:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <H​andyberlin> How do I turn this on? I have the same problem.
23:15:40 <sizzyb> Ah just checked again from additional updates AFTER plugging in the phone. Ther was a LeMobile Bootloader Interface driver to download.
23:15:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> Here we go)
23:31:47 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Daniel (@j​m5194) has joined the Telegram Group!
23:46:07 <sizzyb> moving onward! thanks GrapheneOS-Teleg
23:47:11 <sizzyb> It couldve been 1) firmware wasn't updated bc laptop not plugged in 2) needed to connect pixel to CPU when it wasnt in bootloader mode first
23:47:27 <sizzyb> I'm thinking it was the latter
23:53:59 <TheJollyRoger> sizzyb: yep, you need to connect the Pixel to the computer when it's in bootloader mode. It's worth noting that the Pixel is considered an entirely different and distinct device when it's in Bootloader mode.
23:57:19 <m2tu[m]> I need to set SDcard on readonly from boot .... using build...
23:57:45 <m2tu[m]> shall i do it on "on early-init"
23:57:45 <m2tu[m]>   /sdcard /storage/sdcard0
23:58:14 <m2tu[m]> or "on fs"
23:59:15 <sizzyb> TheJollyRoger the problem was the contrary, actually. I had only ever hooked up my pixel to my CPU while in bootloader. But i think in order for the drives to initiate, I needed to connect my pixel to the CPU while NOT in bootloader
23:59:17 <jj1013[m]> Blimey, TheJollyRoger. I can not seem to pull out that ACTION thingy. How do you do that?
23:59:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> ACTION feels annoyed
