01:24:40 <futurenv[m]> Currently experiencing an issue trying to flash a Pixel 4a with GOS from a Mac. The step causing trouble is the update image-sunfish...   and it's making it through the flashing of all images however after it extracts "super_empty.img" it hangs on "rebooting into fastboot". After about 15 minutes nothing happened and when I rebooted the device from the bootloader screen it went into a boot loop saying "no valid slot
01:24:40 <futurenv[m]> to boot"
01:28:50 <louipcm> futurenv:  might be a problem with your usb
01:31:20 <futurenv[m]> Okay, I'm using the one from Google out of the box, but will try using a different one and a different port
01:35:08 <futurenv[m]> Still no luck, device hangs on fastbootd reboot screen and Mac terminal hangs on "rebooting into fastboot". Are there any known issues when flashing from a Mac?
01:47:27 <b1101> hello. is there a way to skip music tracks with music buttons. I jumped into graphene for a few days, but that feature is really important to me, as I listen to a bunch of music from my phone
02:33:15 <b1101> I removed it after a few days of use, mostly because of that option, and a few other minor features, but kind of regret it :/
02:48:57 <jameshandcockand> Wut
02:52:07 <ON30V3RB04RD> anyone around to help with install issue?
02:52:57 <b1101> jameshandcockand: I use volume keys for music skip track/go back. no need to take phone out of pocket i
02:53:07 <rny> ON30V3RB04RD: sure, whats the problem
02:53:24 <ON30V3RB04RD> pixel 3, updated to latest factory via adb/fastboot, when go to flash-all.bat its says fastboot to old, yet i have the latest..

02:54:54 <ON30V3RB04RD> does that not come with lastest stock android firmware?
02:55:07 <ON30V3RB04RD> i saw it updated to a new version
02:55:23 <rny> so the flash-all script actually changes from time-to-time
02:55:39 <rny> i'm guessing you used an old flash-all.bat script from a previous install?

03:17:45 <b1101> when the phone first starts, it should still show that first screen that says you're using a different operating system?; ie not stock
03:18:06 <deappledapple> Yeah
03:29:35 <ON30V3RB04RD>  hmm im on google-fi just realizing the caviat here lol
03:32:12 <b1101> so am I. it works with tmobile apn. sim card is required though
03:33:34 <ON30V3RB04RD> sms group text work ok?
03:35:36 <ON30V3RB04RD> i do have a fi sim and a pxl 4 to activate it on
03:46:30 <b1101> ok. so this is the second time I'm installing grapheneos. transfer speed to/from device is definitely slower
05:50:53 <deappledapple> <b1101 "ok. so this is the second time I"> How have you tested it?
05:51:49 <b1101> deappledapple: I have books, music, and videos that I keep on my phone. switching from lineage to graphene the speed drops considerably
05:52:08 <b1101> with adb push
05:55:13 <b1101> adb push even shows the transfer rate for every folder I transfer over. with lineage I would see 100mb+/s. currently transferring all my music, and it's going at 40-50.
05:55:19 <take_a_deep_brea> b1101:  is there something you have in mind in regard to the transfer speed ? any questions ? any suggested improvements ?
05:55:55 <ephemeralang[m]> Is there any reason why an individual graphene os phone running bromite, vanadium, or icecat would have a unique browser fingerprint? (Other than IP) why would it be unique and what can someone do to make it less unique
05:55:55 <take_a_deep_brea> cause im sure as hell just saying that does not help the situation
05:56:22 <b1101> take_a_deep_brea: is it supposed to be slower, because of some security feature in graphene?
05:58:36 <somenerd[m]> I don't think so
05:59:19 <take_a_deep_brea> i too dont think that any security feature slows down transfer rate.
06:00:08 <somenerd[m]> maybe filesystem hardening?
06:00:19 <somenerd[m]> >Filesystem access hardening
06:00:45 <somenerd[m]> even then, idk if there should be any security features which slow down transfer of files
06:01:10 <b1101> clearly something affects it, so possibly that
06:01:28 <take_a_deep_brea> memory usage may be higher because of hardened_malloc. look b1101:  you better wait for someone like strcat who can inform you better
06:01:43 <take_a_deep_brea> before coming to any conclusion in this regard
06:02:46 <b1101> np. moving new files onto the phone isn't something I do often, but the original move is more time consuming
06:03:55 <take_a_deep_brea> ok , maybe because of File based encryption
06:04:06 <take_a_deep_brea> and did you use lineage on same pixel ?
06:04:43 <b1101> yup. same device. second time I'm wiping.
06:05:00 <b1101> reinstallg graphene that is
06:06:01 <take_a_deep_brea>  * ok , maybe because of File based encryption
06:07:20 <b1101> so lineage is just disc encryption then?
06:07:31 <take_a_deep_brea> im not sure.
06:07:49 <take_a_deep_brea> if its aosp then on a pixel it should be file based
06:08:32 <take_a_deep_brea> but grapheneOS adds significantly to the aosp implementation : https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
06:09:49 <b1101> nice. that would make a lot of sense
07:29:48 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is it possible to enable your phone to automatically factory reset after a few incorrect password attempts on GrapheneOS?
07:31:51 <take_a_deep_brea> dxrwzy9y: no. but maybe this will help :
07:31:51 <take_a_deep_brea> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
07:33:10 <take_a_deep_brea> in particular the paragraph dealing with failed attempts at encryption key derivation
07:34:19 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Right, I see but I'd still feel more comfortable if that data is completely wiped.
07:35:12 <take_a_deep_brea> dxrwzy9y: right now this comes very close to data getting wiped
07:35:41 <take_a_deep_brea> especially if a strong passphtase is used
07:36:23 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I hope Graphene will have an option for that in the future.
07:36:24 <nscnt[m]> It doesn't matter how you feel, tbh. We don't care about marketing or theater just to let you feel good. If it doesn't make sense, it won't be done.
07:37:21 <nscnt[m]> Too many tradeoffs for the little you actually gain.
07:37:32 <dxrwzy9y[m]> But it does make sense. No data = nothing to be extracted. The security might be bullet proof for now but who knows as far as the future is concerned.
07:38:37 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Not to mention I doubt companies like Cellebrite or NSO Group would tell us if they can bypass the password or not.
07:39:26 <deappledapple> <nscnt[m] "It doesn't matter how you feel, "> Well, if somebody can step up and do PR for this to work, then maybe it will be considered
07:39:53 <nscnt[m]> dxrwzy9y: Take a look at 2 D) https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
07:40:23 <take_a_deep_brea> if this comes under plausible deniability then thats already been dealt with
07:41:16 <take_a_deep_brea> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Not to mention I doubt companies"> we do not deal with that threat level.
07:42:14 <nscnt[m]> I think we do, don't we? But there a limits in the real world whereas in your imagination.
07:43:01 <nscnt[m]> ... in your imagination there are not.
07:43:27 <take_a_deep_brea> nscnt:  if we were then surely this wouldnt be my first step.
07:43:41 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Okay, anyway, so assuming my phone gets seized for whatever reason, would I be safe?
07:44:38 <deappledapple> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Okay, anyway, so assuming my pho"> If you haven't unlocked your phone at any point after rebooting it, it is safer than doing otherwise
07:44:52 <take_a_deep_brea> if you have a long (> 15 (arbitrary) )random passphrase then yes. you can rely on the device.
07:44:53 <nscnt[m]> If you're able to turn it off, it's perfect.
07:44:57 <deappledapple> Before first unlock state at reboot does not have keys at memory, after first unlock does
07:45:38 <take_a_deep_brea> dxrwzy9y:  use a secondary profile as a main profile.
07:45:46 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So having the screen off isn't as secure as having the whole phone turned off?
07:46:00 <nscnt[m]> Yes, it isn't as secure.
07:46:24 <take_a_deep_brea> dxrwzy9y: the recommended setup is described in the encryption section of the FAQ
07:46:41 <deappledapple> <take_a_deep_brea "if you have a long (> 15 (arbitr"> If the passphrase has 128-bit entropy, that would suffice, not to mention the [delays enforced by key derivation](https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption)
07:46:49 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
07:47:05 <dxrwzy9y[m]> So the only way to mitigate that is to just have a better password? I doubt you'd be able to have the time to shut down your phone in such a situation.
07:47:23 <take_a_deep_brea> Our recommendation for a high security setup is to use the owner profile only for managing other profiles. Using a secondary profile for regular usage allows you to make use of the device without decrypting the data in your regular usage profile. It also allows putting it at rest without rebooting the device.
07:48:57 <deappledapple> <take_a_deep_brea "Our recommendation for a high se"> As end session button or logout [purges credential encrypted storage keys from memory](https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.10.06.02) since October 6 release of GrapheneOS
07:49:12 <deappledapple> Which applies only on secondary users. Owner user is "logged out" by rebooting
07:49:32 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is there any quick way to factory reset your phone perhaps?
07:49:43 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Like pressing a button combination?
07:50:54 <deappledapple> None so far. Just reboot your phone
07:50:55 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Anything that'll only take a second or two in such a situation where my phone would be seized.
07:52:13 <take_a_deep_brea> dxrwzy9y: i am not aware of any. and if i may suggest , the only methods available for factory resetting are clunky enough that anyone can notice.
07:53:04 <dxrwzy9y[m]> I think that might be a useful feature request though, no?
07:53:09 <take_a_deep_brea> my assumption here is your model involves people coercing you to give up your pin/passphrase /pattern
07:53:41 <take_a_deep_brea> <dxrwzy9y[m] "I think that might be a useful f"> thats been asked before . if you give me a sec. .....
07:54:05 <take_a_deep_brea> ok i think this is going kinda offtopic
07:54:41 <deappledapple> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/29

07:55:29 <dxrwzy9y[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "my assumption here is your model"> Yeah anything where either a state actor or a criminal might force you to give up your phone and/or forces you to provide the password under treats of torture or whatever else they might coerce you with.
07:56:09 <take_a_deep_brea> well we can discuss this further on off topic room , not here.
07:56:31 <take_a_deep_brea> as per the rules
07:58:54 <deappledapple> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:05:55 <mark4o> I just created a new user profile, it has a numeric PIN screen lock and switching to it works great, but when switching back to the main profile which has a password screen lock, it won't show the keyboard to enter the password.  Is that a known issue?
08:06:14 <mark4o> After rebooting the keyboard is back.
08:06:16 <silentresearch[m> <dxrwzy9y[m] "Is it possible to enable your ph"> Good feature, but won't be implemented by the dev team. You can always use some 3rd party MDM that might have a feature like that or create your own fork.
08:07:09 <silentresearch[m> <nscnt[m] "... in your imagination there ar"> "We" in this channel usually refers to "we the developers" or "we the borg" not "we the people"
08:09:37 <silentresearch[m> We the people definitely deal with the kind of threat level you have in your mind.
08:10:43 <take_a_deep_brea>  well , silentresearch:   here is an issue you can mull over  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/85
08:11:41 <take_a_deep_brea> and please dont suggest an MDM as it can be buggy like any other software and hence more vulnerable and would defeat the original purpose of the feature : control over user data
08:12:24 <take_a_deep_brea> im sure you do not mean to introduce "extra agents" in a users system handling their data .
08:12:30 <silentresearch[m> buggy or not - if the user desperately needs the feature let him explore the options
08:12:56 <deappledapple> Sure, but device management apps has more control over the user itself
08:13:58 <take_a_deep_brea> sure silentresearch:  we just make suggestions , however this is not the place for exploration .
08:14:33 <silentresearch[m> <deappledapple "Sure, but device management apps"> It has as much control as you give to it
08:15:13 <take_a_deep_brea> silentresearch:  i think its called "device management app" for a reason.
08:15:43 <mark4o> I found that if I tap on Emergency Call and then back out the keyboard will come back.  So that is a better workaround than rebooting.
08:16:13 <silentresearch[m> then you think wrong. there are different policies - look at blackberry enterprise management for example
08:16:37 <silentresearch[m> The level of control you give away depends on how it's  been set up
08:17:35 <silentresearch[m> after going through the issues I realized that the functionality for a wipe after x failed attempts has already been implemented. It just needs to be implemented in the UX
08:17:52 <silentresearch[m> So obviously someone here thought we deal with that kind of threat level and that it makes sense.
08:18:07 <silentresearch[m> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/206#issuecomment-682100851
08:18:44 <deappledapple> <silentresearch[m "It has as much control as you gi"> https://developer.android.com/work/dpc/device-management
08:19:30 <deappledapple> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin
08:19:48 <deappledapple> <deappledapple "https://developer.android.com/wo"> The checklist says otherwise
08:20:48 <deappledapple> <silentresearch[m "https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os"> There's an instance that requirement is being removed on porting features into the userspace, such as the "end session" features
08:21:11 <deappledapple> Unsure why device admin app having more control over a user profile than the user profile itself is even a debate
08:21:58 <silentresearch[m> I have a device with Blackberry UEM - It clearly lists what the admin can and what he can not do.
08:22:19 <silentresearch[m> All those points can be disabled or enabled during the setup.
08:22:40 <silentresearch[m> not all MDM solutions use all possible rights
08:24:00 <deappledapple> <silentresearch[m "I have a device with Blackberry "> Doesn't change the fact on what that permission can do, and why it is being detected on Auditor (to ensure the integrity of the device)
08:24:23 <deappledapple> You're seriously debating what a piece of code can do?
08:24:54 <silentresearch[m> You come up with fake news - I debunk them... that's not a debate
08:25:30 <silentresearch[m> If you allow an app to remotely wipe your device and nothing else, that's exactly what the app will be able to do.
08:25:36 <deappledapple> Sure, the official Android documentation is fake news.
08:27:17 <silentresearch[m> Again - for those who didn't have their coffee yet - Not all device admin apps make use of all possible options that android gives them. If the policies only allow remote wipe it will be able to wipe your device and that's it.
08:28:10 <silentresearch[m> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin#how
08:28:13 <silentresearch[m> first sentence
08:28:22 <silentresearch[m> You use the Device Administration API to write device admin apps that users install on their devices. The device admin app enforces the desired policies.
08:28:27 <take_a_deep_brea> <silentresearch[m "Again - for those who didn't hav"> silentresearch: i just think its a bad idea to have any sort of an "agent" , an app in this instance with selective extra priviliges between the user and all of their data
08:28:52 <take_a_deep_brea> and if the app cant access all the data , then in this case its useless
08:28:52 <silentresearch[m> You are entitled to your own opinion - just don't tell me what's possible and what not if you don't know.
08:29:22 <take_a_deep_brea> silentresearch: no ones talking of a possinbility here . i said its a bad idea.
08:29:33 <silentresearch[m> The app doesn't have to be able to access all data. It just needs to be able to trigger the factory reset via the Device Administration API
08:30:02 <silentresearch[m> And if that is the only permission it has it's fairly safe to say that it won't be able to fuck around in any other way.
08:30:06 <take_a_deep_brea> then why an app ? isnt a system UX enough ? look you brought up the MDM thing , sir,
08:30:14 <take_a_deep_brea> not us,
08:30:45 <silentresearch[m> system UX would be enough but you guys just said "We don't want it" - so I tell the user the alternative options
08:30:59 <deappledapple> <take_a_deep_brea "then why an app ? isnt a system "> It can be exposed in the system without that condition, like the logout feature. Just saying that it's usually not a great idea to just grant permissions to any app
08:31:24 <take_a_deep_brea> it wont be an open issue if " we dont want it"
08:31:26 <silentresearch[m> > Too many tradeoffs for the little you actually gain.
08:33:10 <deappledapple> "Once users enable the device admin app, they are subject to its policies."
08:33:10 <deappledapple> The same link also tells you that the permission controls or restricts a user profile
08:33:19 <take_a_deep_brea> and why are we debating this here ? the proper place would be off topic
08:33:23 <deappledapple> Unsure why it is up to debate how the permission works.
08:33:31 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
08:34:12 <silentresearch[m> what is this channel for?
08:34:34 <silentresearch[m> It's the go-to channel for people interested in the project / product
08:35:23 <take_a_deep_brea> it is not for speculation . you are welcome to the off topic room.
08:35:33 <take_a_deep_brea> didnt mean to sound harsh
08:36:05 <silentresearch[m> you don't
08:36:18 <silentresearch[m> I just wanted to know what this channel is for
08:36:32 <silentresearch[m> it appears to be for the devs and dev focused issues
08:37:16 <deappledapple> Android works under the principle of the least privilege, and GrapheneOS follows this by implementing features that's possible to be done without special app permissions needed
08:37:17 <silentresearch[m> But everyone who comes in touch with grapheneOS and has a questions comes here too...
08:37:25 <take_a_deep_brea> sure
08:37:51 <take_a_deep_brea> just that this topic can veer into speculation .
08:37:51 <deappledapple> Sure, anything tangential to GrapheneOS, like use cases, what apps should I try, or is recommended goes here #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:38:35 <take_a_deep_brea> this is more for people who have trouble installing and trying to troubleshoot some system issue
08:38:36 <silentresearch[m> I think you should make the main channel the off-topic one - especially when the subreddit sends people with questions over here :D
08:39:00 <silentresearch[m> a 2nd channel for devs & troubleshooting would help the devs to focus on the important stuff
08:39:15 <silentresearch[m> because this is clearly the channel were most people join and ask their off-topic questions
08:39:25 <silentresearch[m> just my 2 cents
08:40:07 <silentresearch[m> then you wouldn't lose so much time telling people to discuss something @off-topic :D
08:40:31 <nscnt[m]> This chat here is for GrapheneOS related questions (developing, questions from users about GrapheneOS, ...).
08:41:05 <silentresearch[m> but you don't want a discussion to evolve around this questions and possible solutions...
08:41:53 <nscnt[m]> What questions and solutions?
08:45:37 <nscnt[m]> If you're not a developer, you probably don't have all the information and knowledge that is needed to do X. No suggestion is approved just to make the user feel good. If it doesn't make sense from a technical point of view, that will be said.
08:50:53 <nscnt[m]> Computer science (CS) is interdisciplinary. What is computable (core question of theoretical CS; especially interesting for cryptography)? How do you develop software efficiently (part of the software engineering subarea) and all of that. I don't expect a user to be an expert in that, but I expect the user to acknowledge that he may have huge knowledge gaps.
08:51:51 <nscnt[m]> While the project does a lot to educate its users, it's not practical to write whole papers every time a questions arises.
08:52:03 <nscnt[m]>  * While the project does a lot to educate its users, it's not practical to write whole papers every time a question arises.
08:55:21 <kkm6761[m]> where should i ask for guidance with regards to porting graphene os to another phone? this or the offtopic section?
08:57:07 <deappledapple> Here. Try following grapheneos.org/build and if you got stuck, then try to ask for help somewhere
08:57:28 <deappledapple> Assuming that's on Pixels. Unsure on other phones
08:58:47 <kkm6761[m]> it is for another phone. i need the generic os. but it is on github. i want first to compile a generic image.
08:59:28 <deappledapple> * Here. Try following grapheneos.org/build and if you got stuck, then try to ask for help here
09:09:04 <take_a_deep_brea> kkm6761: you can compile generic images too . do go through that linked information.
09:27:09 <silentresearch[m> <nscnt[m] "While the project does a lot to "> I think you underestimate some users... just because someone doesn't suck dick doesn't mean that he doesn't know exactly how a good blowjob should be done.
09:41:02 <saucy-salamander> <silentresearch[m "I think you underestimate some u"> Of all the metaphors, you picked that one hahah
09:41:33 <silentresearch[m> ;)
09:56:55 <edgar1[m]> Pretty good metaphor actually. Gets the point across and it was funny.
10:18:27 <silentresearch[m>  ... and just because someone did suck dick for years doesn't mean that he or she knows what he or she is doing :P
10:24:21 <flou_srs[m]> I have a question
10:24:32 <flou_srs[m]> Does graphene os support full disk encryption still?
10:25:22 <bentley> the disk is always encrypted
10:25:24 <bentley> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
10:25:43 <bentley> it's filesystem-based instead of FDE
10:26:06 <flou_srs[m]> Isn't FBE more vulnerable to an adversary with physical access to it?
10:26:12 <bentley> how so?
10:26:55 <flou_srs[m]> From what I understood they can either sideload a custom firmware, access the files through a laptop/pc, or connect it to thr internet
10:27:15 <flou_srs[m]> As opposed to full disk encryption where an attacker can not do anything if he does not have the password except bruteforce
10:27:56 <bentley> the attacker can't do anything with filesystem-based encryption either
10:28:06 <bentley> even filenames are encrypted
10:28:20 <bentley> all files are encrypted
10:29:01 <flou_srs[m]> Would an adversary with a sophisticated computerlab be able to gain access to my file on a phone with graphene os provided I have a 40 character long random computer generated password?
10:29:24 <flou_srs[m]> This is a realistic concern in my threatmodel as I live in a MENA country
10:29:47 <bentley> if the adversary doesn't know your password, then probably not
10:30:04 <flou_srs[m]> Okay
10:31:05 <flou_srs[m]> Curious as to what backdoors or tricks can be used to gain access to a phone and how graphene OS mitigates such threats.
10:31:26 <take_a_deep_brea> https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
10:31:29 <take_a_deep_brea> please
10:32:40 <nscnt[m]> flou_srs: Read https://grapheneos.org/faq#security-and-privacy
10:33:03 <flou_srs[m]> I am not talking about a hypothetical intelligence agency that can gather info using xkeyscore or the like I am talking about the very realistic threat of my phone being stolen by an adversary
10:33:50 <bentley> backdoors are out of scope for grapheneos. barring that, it would require a heretofore-unknown hardware exploit. pixels are probably the best phone on the market to avoid those.

10:39:04 <flou_srs[m]> Thanks a lot guys I really appreciate these answers
10:39:34 <flou_srs[m]> My main concern is getting arrested when I go back home for criticism on the regime (not legal where I am from)
10:40:42 <bentley> can they force you to unlock your phone?
10:41:52 <silentresearch[m> <flou_srs[m] "Thanks a lot guys I really appre"> Just don't store sensitive messages on the device
10:43:11 <flou_srs[m]> bentley: they can use torture but I don't think they'd resort to that as first option. They'll try to break into the phone first.
10:43:26 <flou_srs[m]> silentresearch: if only it were that easy. And it is not just messages I have to worry about
10:44:35 <deappledapple> <bentley "can they force you to unlock you"> Depending on the country's key disclosure laws.
10:44:53 <bentley> obviously. i was asking about flou_srs's country specifically.
10:47:44 <silentresearch[m> <deappledapple "Depending on the country's key d"> incorrect - there is plenty of evidence of civilized 1st world countries forcing people to unlock their phones or minds even when the law didn't allow it... it always depends on the matter on hand
10:47:54 <take_a_deep_brea> discussion on social engineering and rubberhose cryptanalysis can also be done in the off topic channel in my opinion
10:48:02 <nscnt[m]> Offtopic
10:48:30 <silentresearch[m> let's make a counter for the word "offtopic"
10:48:48 <silentresearch[m> if it reaches 50 on any given day you create a dev channel and let that main channel here be the off-topic :D
10:49:14 <nscnt[m]> This is a GrapheneOS channel. You're not talking about GrapheneOS.
10:49:53 <take_a_deep_brea> silentresearch: come on , sir , its  a nice place - the off topic channel .
10:49:54 <silentresearch[m> The original question was about grapheneOS wasn't it? then a discussion evolved
10:50:08 <flou_srs[m]> bentley: I have family members in the government. It is very corrupt where I live so torture is something unlikely to be used against me. If I manage to protect my device from their cyber team then I will be most likely safe
10:50:20 <silentresearch[m> sounds like Ukraine :D
10:50:24 <flou_srs[m]> This is why I care about the encryption standard on my phone
10:50:32 <take_a_deep_brea> flou_srs: sure ,.
10:50:40 <deappledapple> It's kinda drifting away from it
10:50:41 <deappledapple> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org is made to not flood more relevant GrapheneOS topic or flashing/building assistance
10:51:01 <silentresearch[m> I totally understand your point
10:51:10 <silentresearch[m> but again - every new user joins THIS channel
10:51:37 <nscnt[m]> Because this is the channel of GrapheneOS
10:51:44 <nscnt[m]> So they are right here
10:51:44 <take_a_deep_brea> <silentresearch[m "but again - every new user joins"> and each one of them with your exception agrees to move their discourcse to the off-topic channel
10:52:22 <take_a_deep_brea> its just a matter of joining one more room ,
10:52:24 <silentresearch[m> take_a_deep_breath: I like you too :*
10:54:40 <take_a_deep_brea> sure silentresearch:  i will like you even better in the off-topic .
10:55:06 <silentresearch[m> already there :D now pushing the people with grapheneOS questions back to this channel :D
11:44:16 <somenerd[m]> > but again - every new user joins THIS channel
11:44:16 <somenerd[m]> yeah but normally people don't start offtopic convos here
11:45:27 <somenerd[m]> they start with some sort of GrapheneOS q, and then move slowly offtopic
11:47:14 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
11:48:46 <somenerd[m]> ex: Talking about Vanadium -> Firefox insecurities
11:49:13 <justanotherlurke> Seeing the amount of traffic here that is caused by walking people through the installation process (in a surprising high number because they prefer to follow some YT guru instead of rtfm):
11:49:13 <justanotherlurke> Would it make sense / be possible to create a separate channel "GrapheneOS installation support"?
11:49:13 <justanotherlurke> Would allow this channel to be more focussed on actual OS questions ...
11:49:50 <somenerd[m]> There aren't many OS questions imo compared to installation help
11:50:06 <somenerd[m]> this room also acts like a gateway to the GrapheneOS community
11:50:26 <DarkUranium> IRC is a gateway drug.
11:50:56 <stencil[m]> Came, saw, hated irc
11:51:01 <justanotherlurke> <somenerd[m] "There aren't many OS questions i"> That's exactly my point: The actual OS questions drown in the flood of "have you tried another USB cable", "have you set $PATH" etc ...
11:55:18 <deappledapple> <somenerd[m] "There aren't many OS questions i"> Yeah, not really much to ask if FAQ is already there to answer most of those questions
11:55:49 <somenerd[m]> and most Qs here are solved by reading the FAQ
11:56:48 * kkm6761[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/FAnyaCKgAOEceqVHVgVQQKWc/message.txt >
11:56:52 <justanotherlurke> <somenerd[m] "and most Qs here are solved by r"> Same could be said for the excellent step-by-step instructions for installation ...
11:57:22 <somenerd[m]> command line tools are a lot more complicated than the FAQ
11:57:37 <somenerd[m]> you can't really solve installation problems with a link to the guide
11:58:01 <justanotherlurke> <kkm6761[m] "> <@justanotherlurker:matrix.org"> Don't know what needs to be clarified in a set of copy-and-paste-instructions, really. Which will become unnecessary anyway, once the webinstall is available.
11:59:28 <justanotherlurke> After some weeks here I just think it would make sense to break down the channels into the sequence of events:
11:59:39 <justanotherlurke> 1. How do I get it onto my phone (install)
11:59:56 <justanotherlurke> 2. What does it do there and how does it work (OS)
12:00:21 <justanotherlurke> 3. How can I use third-party apps and OT discussions (OT)
12:02:00 <justanotherlurke> I think in all three cases the written documentation will always need to be supplemented by live discussions in a channel, if only to challenge one's understanding before committing potentially unsafe changed settings to the OS.
12:02:28 <justanotherlurke> But that's just my impression ...
12:03:18 <kkm6761[m]> 4. porting graphene os to non supported devices (unofficial graphene os)
12:03:32 <DarkUranium> I'm not convinced this channel has enough traffic to warrant splitting it up. YMMV.
12:04:14 <somenerd[m]> > 4. porting graphene os to non supported devices (unofficial graphene os)
12:04:14 <somenerd[m]> I don't think that this channel is needed (nor the installation channel)
12:04:29 <somenerd[m]> yeah there isn't that much activity to split it up imo
12:05:12 <DarkUranium> Offtopic could make sense, but that has more to do with policy and trying to keep random other stuff "clean", rather than amount of traffic.

12:05:52 <deappledapple> Hmmm, going to install the prerequisite packages
12:06:03 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build
12:06:08 <somenerd[m]> this may help
12:06:18 <deappledapple> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
12:06:32 <HiccupJul> recently, i've got the error "can't connect to camera" when starting the camera app. an auto-update recently ran, so maybe that caused it. but is there a way to rule-out a hardware problem?
12:06:45 <HiccupJul> other than re-installing the stock operating system.
12:06:54 <HiccupJul> this is on a pixel 3 xl.
12:07:03 <somenerd[m]> maybe check the permissions
12:07:03 <somenerd[m]> ?
12:07:12 <deappledapple> <HiccupJul "recently, i've got the error "ca"> Try force stop, clear data first on camera app
12:07:25 <HiccupJul> i already checked the permissions
12:07:35 <HiccupJul> i think i tried force stop + clear data too, but i'll try again
12:07:58 <HiccupJul> no use
12:08:19 <HiccupJul> restarting doesn't help either
12:08:23 <HiccupJul> its been happening for a day or so
12:08:45 <HiccupJul> there is a "report" option in the error dialog, but i doubt it does anything
12:08:52 <HiccupJul> it doesn't visually do anything
12:09:14 <HiccupJul> i tried Open Camera from fdroid too
12:09:20 <HiccupJul> no luck
12:10:15 <deappledapple> It sounds more like a hardware problem tbh, if clear data, reboot, disable/enable doesn't work
12:10:28 <HiccupJul> yeah it is a second-hand somewhat battered phone
12:10:33 <HiccupJul> so maybe the camera just died
12:11:57 <HiccupJul> although maybe its just one of the cameras that has failed
12:12:01 <HiccupJul> just the inner or the outer
12:12:20 <HiccupJul> but maybe the failure of just one of them causes the error
12:23:39 <strcat[m]> dxrwzy9y: a sophisticated attacker with physical access is presumably going to exploit the OS so no OS limits matter to them
12:27:31 <strcat[m]> they have physical access to the device
12:27:44 <strcat[m]> they can stop it from getting internet access and take any amount of time needed to mess with it
12:28:16 <strcat[m]> an OS-based limit on the number of unlock attempts before wiping is a very weak protection and won't actually accomplish much - and it's already implemented
12:28:38 <strcat[m]> got tired of silentresearch's concern trolling
12:28:45 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
12:29:04 <strcat[m]> looked through scrollback while I was asleep
12:29:25 <strcat[m]> don't appreciate people making false claims about the goals of the project and our plans
12:29:34 <strcat[m]> to try to cause harm to it
12:29:40 <strcat[m]> don't see any reason for someone malicious to be in the channel
12:29:45 <strcat[m]> even if they mostly behaved
12:30:09 <strcat[m]> they were also super annoying yesterday with their refusal to apply critical thinking to their proposal to understand why we don't want to implement it
12:30:15 <strcat[m]> the fingerprint thing
12:30:26 <strcat[m]> where we have a planned feature for adding a PIN as a 2nd factor to fingerprint
12:30:42 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah. i guess today was just resentment .
12:30:47 <strcat[m]> but they were insistent on essentially entering a PIN by swiping N fingerprints from different fingers
12:31:07 <strcat[m]> and just keep going on about it
12:31:29 <strcat[m]> insisting that we are wrong to compare their feature to anything but fingerprint-only unlock
12:31:36 <strcat[m]> just irrational and annoying
12:31:40 <strcat[m]> and then the concern trolling
12:31:56 <strcat[m]> put up with a lot of their BS yesterday already
12:32:05 <strcat[m]> I'm sure now they're going to go complain somewhere else about being banned
12:32:32 <strcat[m]> would appreciate if people in this community can respond to people doing that in other channels when people do that if you happen to be in the other channel
12:32:54 <strcat[m]> sometimes people are only contributing negatively to the channel and are disrupting useful conversations
12:33:01 <take_a_deep_brea> thats the sad part . this room has very high tolerance but some people do manage to push it.
12:33:13 <strcat[m]> people talking about wiping after N attempts don't need someone jumping in to spread attacks on the developers with misinformation
12:33:28 <strcat[m]> then they seemed to actually search and see that adding a UI for the existing feature is planned
12:33:38 <strcat[m]> but of course without acknowledging they just made up BS about it
12:33:39 <DarkUranium> strcat[m], I've actually had someone privmsg me once (after an incident), and then go on and publically complain about how *I* messaged *them* without asking. I didn't even reply, except to tell them not to privmsg me.
12:41:08 <deappledapple> <strcat[m] "sometimes people are only contri"> Sorry have been a little too tolerant on them, hoping they would have changed their approach.
12:42:34 * deappledapple shrugs
12:55:37 <strcat[m]> they did something that crossed a line which is claiming the project has a position it does not out of spite
12:56:04 <strcat[m]> serious doubt that they actually have a developer working for them
12:56:50 <strcat[m]> took their interest in contributing seriously but I don't see how someone can contribute who just wants to argue with a bunch of fallacies and not do things in the way the project wants
12:57:13 <strcat[m]> for us to accept a contribution it needs to be done in the way we want it to be done
12:57:18 <strcat[m]> and that only gets more specific when reviewing the work starts
12:57:53 <strcat[m]> so if they are going to treat it as their way or the highway
12:58:01 <strcat[m]> well, they aren't going to be making any actual contribution
12:58:09 <i_> Anyone know if the warning after the OS install can be removed "your device is loading a different operating system"?
12:58:32 <strcat[m]> i_: that warning will exist on any device not *specifically* built to run the official GrapheneOS releases
12:59:15 <i_> my question is, is there a way to remove it or a work around?
12:59:26 <i_> I understand why it's there
12:59:27 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/avb/+/master/README.md#recommended-bootflow
12:59:36 <strcat[m]> i_: no it's part of verified boot
12:59:44 <i_> gotcha, thanks!
12:59:52 <strcat[m]> the way to remove it is producing a device with our key built-in to the firmware instead of stored on the secure element as part of flashing
13:00:04 <strcat[m]> when it's using the secure element key, it shows that notice
13:00:08 <i_> makes sense, I will look into this
13:00:32 <i_> 1 more question, is there a way to remove the Google logo or replace it with another logo?
13:01:18 <strcat[m]> it's the late stage bootloader splash screen
13:01:29 <HiccupJul> btw, you can speed-up boot by double-clicking the power button
13:01:36 <strcat[m]> it would probably be possible for the OS to overwrite the screen earlier in the boot process
13:01:40 <strcat[m]> but the bootloader splash is the way it is
13:01:52 <HiccupJul> (its a quick way to "confirm" you want to boot the non-google OS)
13:02:38 <strcat[m]> i_: the boot chain is signed, and at the point it starts using our key, it shows that warning
13:03:03 <strcat[m]> the bootloader splash is written out by the bootloader and then when the OS has gotten to the point that it has loaded the kernel and the kernel has mounted and loaded userspace + verified it
13:03:13 <strcat[m]> then it overwrites the screen with the boot animation
13:03:41 <strcat[m]> it would be possible to teach the kernel to zero out the buffer to overwrite it earlier but it isn't something we want to bother with
13:03:56 <i_> thanks for the clarification
13:04:15 <strcat[m]> if we had our own device
13:04:21 <strcat[m]> we would have our choice of bootloader splash screen
13:04:24 <i_> must say the OS build is sound and one of the best ones ive seen out there
13:09:52 <stencil[m]> strcat: Can you add the off-channel link in the description of here?
13:10:22 <stencil[m]> *off topic
13:10:45 <strcat[m]> it was there already
13:10:51 <strcat[m]> just without :matrix.org on the Matrix side
13:10:57 <strcat> test
13:11:09 <strcat> hate the noticeable delay that Matrix has for chat
13:11:16 <strcat[m]> test
13:11:29 <strcat[m]> it adds ~500ms+ of latency to messages
13:11:53 <stencil[m]> Like if it's there?
13:12:02 <stencil[m]> Oh yeah that's bad
13:12:59 <strcat[m]> it has maybe ~300ms of latency for pure Matrix
13:12:59 <stencil[m]> Add a space before the colon
13:13:04 <strcat[m]> the bridge adds another ~200ms or so
13:13:31 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org us the full channel for matrix
13:13:38 <strcat[m]>  * #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org is the full channel for matrix
13:13:42 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic isn'
13:13:46 <strcat[m]>  * #grapheneos-offtopic isn't specific
13:14:04 <strcat[m]> for irc #grapheneos-offtopic is the full channel because it's relative to the current one
13:14:05 <stencil[m]> Y, so just adding the link slows the channel down?
13:14:11 <strcat[m]> but Matrix channels have many names not a specific name
13:14:16 <strcat[m]> stencil: not saying that
13:14:21 <strcat[m]> just saying that Matrix in general has a delay
13:14:33 <strcat[m]> I said something, then opened my irc client
13:14:44 <strcat[m]> and then, after it connected to the server/channels
13:14:52 <strcat[m]> I saw the messages that I sent on Matrix arrive
13:14:58 <strcat[m]> just made me remember how ridiculously slow Matrix is
13:15:07 <stencil[m]> Oh, it was another program. My client suddenly got super slow
13:15:36 <stencil[m]> That's why I thought the channel link made this channel slow

16:40:08 <stencil[m]> IxBert  --version
16:40:20 <stencil[m]> * IxBert  fastboot --version
16:41:27 <IxBert> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
16:41:28 <stencil[m]> Run this command(without your name)
16:42:06 <IxBert> I checked that before running it ... it is the one specified in the guide
16:42:37 <blk> Has anyone been able to get native visual voicemail working?
16:42:45 <stencil[m]> You also did this right? `Remove-Item Alias:Curl`
16:43:04 <stencil[m]> IxBert just going through step by step
16:45:05 <stencil[m]> And then this `$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"`
16:52:10 <IxBert> stencil[m] I really follow it step by step
16:52:23 <IxBert> but the error does also not make sense to me
16:52:37 <IxBert> maybe it is still the cable
17:15:32 <stencil[m]> Hmm, maybe you could give the error?
17:15:58 <stencil[m]> strcat should be here now
17:19:53 <bentley> if i plugged a usb microphone into a usb-c hub and plugged it into a pixel, can i tell the os to use that microphone for all apps instead of the internal?
17:21:29 <M0n30v3rb04rd[m]> sure try it :)
17:22:23 <bentley> i'm asking first because i haven't bought a hub yet
18:17:12 <snooopy> Thank you all for your work on this project, it's great and exactly what I was looking for! <3
18:18:27 <nux> snooopy: I couldn't agree more! Have you considered donating to the project? They take Paypal! ;)
18:22:05 <snooopy> nux: Yeah, I may do that in the future. :)
18:22:56 <nux> snooopy: Great! I'd love to see the project continue long into the future.
18:26:28 <nux> snooopy: In this day and age of unprecidented censorship and lack of digital privacy, we need every tool we can get our hands on to protect ourselves. GrapheneOS goes a long way towards empowering us.
18:37:52 <kkm6761[m]> <nux "snooopy: In this day and age of "> it would go even further if the devs were more open to other devs porting to other phones.
18:38:15 <take_a_deep_brea> kkm6761:  i dont understand.
18:39:58 <kkm6761[m]> graphen os is limited to only pixel phones. i know the team can't officially support more, but it could grow. why doesn't it?
18:41:34 <take_a_deep_brea> well im not a dev , btw. but afaik there is a shortage od people willing to work.
18:42:07 <take_a_deep_brea> even on existing iasues in the os_issue_tracker
18:44:23 <take_a_deep_brea> kkm6761:  you are welcome to port graphene to any other device that meets certain baseline security features in the hardware.my knowledge of this matter only extends this far.
19:05:46 <nux> kkm6761[m]: I agree it would be nice to have other hardware supported. However, it's a tall order and requires significant resources. Not impossible but outside of current scope of the project as it stands now.
19:06:19 <kkm6761[m]> i have not found those what those baseline security features are. only apple and pixel secure enclave.
19:11:23 <nux> kkm6761[m]: The way I see it at the moment is, the price for the ability to break away from Google and Apple boils downt to the cost of acquriring the supported hardware to run GrapheneOS (plus maybe a little time to get it up and running, and hopefully some sort of a monetary donation). The cost to benefit ratio is wonderful!
19:12:55 <strcat[m]> kkm6761: if someone ports it to another device, they've created their own OS as part of doing that
19:13:36 <strcat[m]> it's unlikely have all the same hardening
19:13:40 <strcat[m]> the hardware probably doesn't support it
19:13:41 <strcat[m]> and a new OS created as a derivative of it should be published under a different name
19:13:43 <strcat[m]> it's not GrapheneOS
19:27:02 <kkm6761[m]> <strcat[m] "and a new OS created as a deriva"> so because every android phone has different android, they should all have different names? lineage os was supported on oneplus phones, because it is ported to other phones it should be called differently?
19:28:00 <strcat[m]> "Android" is an OS family, not a specific OS
19:28:23 <strcat[m]> and yes, if people not associated with the project make an unofficial fork of it
19:28:37 <strcat[m]> that should be called something else
19:28:40 <strcat[m]> pretty obvious, I think
19:28:53 <strcat[m]> if you make a fork of GrapheneOS, that is not GrapheneOS, and if you present it as such that's a problem
19:29:19 <strcat[m]> you should use your own brand if you publish / redistribute it
19:29:30 <strcat[m]> not ours
19:29:36 <strcat[m]> example: GlassROM
19:30:18 <kkm6761[m]> ok. now i am learning something. what is a fork? and why would graphene os on another device be a fork? because it is not official and supported bu original craetors?
19:30:33 <strcat[m]> it is not GrapheneOS
19:30:45 <strcat[m]> if you take the GrapheneOS code and change it, how is that GrapheneOS anymore?
19:30:49 <strcat[m]> it's your own thing based on it
19:31:21 <strcat[m]> all we ask is that you use your own name and say that it's based on GrapheneOS instead of presenting it as being GrapheneOS when it isn't
19:36:18 <kkm6761[m]> i dont plan on distributing it. but i am trying to understand. graphene os is only that when it runs on pixel phones, otherwise it is no more and should be called otherwise?
19:36:18 <kkm6761[m]> that is why there are so many linux/gnu
19:36:18 <kkm6761[m]> i see i'll have a huge amount of work.
19:38:16 <bentley> grapheneos is about security. when it's run on a phone without good hardware security properties, the security is compromised. that insecure system should not be called grapheneos.
19:39:16 <joltman[m]> Have there been communications or discussions with Torba regarding GrapheneOS or is that just rumor?
19:40:18 <kkm6761[m]> how are we sure pixel is secure? and has no backdoor? why is it better apple? malloc is software based hardening.
19:41:51 <bentley> hardware backdoors are out of scope for this channel. see 2D)
19:41:53 <bentley> https://loui.ca/grapheneos.org/static/irc-rules.txt
19:47:33 <strcat> kkm6761[m]: official support for other devices meeting the requirements is something that makes sense
19:47:54 <strcat> a fork with bad security implementing lackluster support for a device not providing what's required is not GrapheneOS
19:48:28 <strcat> jumping to concern trolling if you don't get your way is a sign you're not going to be in the channel for long
19:48:44 <strcat> joltman[m]: don't know what you mean
19:49:01 <strcat> what is Torba?
19:49:42 <strcat> looked it up, don't see anything relevant
19:52:14 <joltman[m]> Andrew Torba, CEO of Gab.com, was interested in having a secure, private phone for Gab users to use to access the social media platform...a "Gab phone." Sounds like he was impressed with GrapheneOS, potentially for that purpose, but there hasn't been any news about it.
19:54:18 <joltman[m]> In a recent interview, he made it sound like he's going forward with some plan for this "Gab phone,", but that details are not being released at this time.
19:54:22 <jameshandcockand> He's a loser lmao
19:55:19 <bentley> gab phone has no involvement with grapheneos. they use grapheneos like any other user/reseller.
19:55:25 <bentley> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1348223822361731074
19:55:45 <joltman[m]> I can't foresee GrapheneOS project ever having any official relationship with Gab.
19:58:36 <joltman[m]> Maybe he'll strike a deal with Copperhead. lol
20:00:04 <taziden> I sincerely hope grapheneos won't provide any help to such nazis ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
20:06:00 <bentley> even making such a suggestion seems like a topic derailment tbh. of course grapheneos won't help gab. there was a whole conversation about this before.
20:08:21 <joltman[m]> The only potential I could even envision is if they provided funds to support maintainers and testers for newer hardware like Pixel 5 or something. Other than that, I can't really envision much opportunity for any agreement. Not much else they could offer and I don't think they have all that much money anyway.
20:09:41 <strcat> they deleted the thread
20:09:50 <strcat> maybe someone showed them what I said in our channel
20:09:59 <strcat> maybe they saw those 3 tweets mentioning trademark
20:10:11 <strcat> joltman[m]: we aren't in control of who uses GrapheneOS
20:10:19 <strcat> unless it was not open source
20:10:24 <strcat> and even then
20:10:45 <strcat> I don't know how someone would propose stopping people from using it based on their views or what criteria would be used
20:11:02 <strcat> it's open source so anyone can use it - as long as they followed the license requirements
20:11:39 <Kurai> what if they don't? how can you enforce the license requirements?
20:12:18 <bentley> they call it copyright *law* for a reason: there are various legal avenues up to and including lawsuit
20:12:18 <joltman[m]> I haven't read the license, but could they or anyone else make money selling phones that they pre-install GrapheneOS on? There are companies that already do this, so I assumed this is allowed.
20:13:34 <strcat> they can sell phones with GrapheneOS
20:13:40 <strcat> if it is a fork of GrapheneOS they need to say that
20:13:50 <strcat> not refer to it as being GrapheneOS itself
20:13:57 <strcat> so if they are making a fork they should say that it's a fork
20:14:02 <strcat> that's trademark law
20:14:05 <strcat> not copyright law
20:14:27 <strcat> the licenses are copyright licenses for the code
20:15:09 <trismous[m]> nux Unless you also need to replace the infrastructure (sync) part of Google's or Apple's ecosystem. E.g. Nextcloud to server this purpose. This is a bit offtopic though.
20:15:48 <bentley> in the words of theo de raadt: open source software "must be free to all (be they people or companies), for any purpose they wish to use it, including modification, use, peeing on, or even integration into baby mulching machines or atomic bombs to be dropped on Australia."
20:16:03 <trismous[m]> * nux Unless you also need to replace the infrastructure (sync) part of Google's or Apple's ecosystem. E.g. Nextcloud to server this purpose. That said this conversation likely belongs to offtopic.
20:16:12 <bentley> i'm glad graphene is open source. strcat didn't have to do that, and i appreciate that he does.
20:17:25 <bentley> and i'm glad that trademarks give him avenues to protect the project's reputation from jerks like copperhead or gab.
20:19:07 <Kurai> like for example https://old.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/hsmo71/onyx_using_recent_antichina_movement_as_excuse_to/
20:19:27 <Kurai> I fail to see what can actually be done if people are not respecting the license
20:19:40 <joltman[m]> I think one potential risk we have is that Gab starts selling GrapheneOS phones and then Google announces that it will lock bootloaders of all future Pixel phones.
20:19:54 <bentley> that seems unlikely.
20:20:10 <bentley> and leaning towards offtopic
20:20:24 <jameshandcockand> This chat sometimes gives me a stroke
20:21:16 <strcat[m]> our end goal is not putting GrapheneOS on Pixels anyway
20:21:38 <strcat[m]> we want to have devices made with hardware partners
20:21:41 <strcat[m]> maybe more than one
20:21:43 <strcat[m]> not using existing devices
20:22:22 <joltman[m]> Never good to be at the mercy of others if you can help it, but in some sense, you always are.
20:22:28 <strcat[m]> someone sent an email to me with the subject `Compress` and the message `Compress PDF smaller size?`
20:22:36 <strcat[m]> that's it
20:22:39 <strcat[m]> and it actually wasn't spam
20:22:46 <strcat[m]> they seem to want us to make a PDF compression tool
20:22:59 <bentley> replace PDF with pdf. there, it's smaller.
20:23:47 <jameshandcockand> Pls sir do the needful and compress pdf
20:24:45 <rafff[m]> Hi,finally could install Gos for the 1st time! Lots of question now, but wanted to ask if there is a guide I can watch anywhere to get some ideas...??
20:25:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install is the official guide
20:25:25 <joltman[m]> It would just be a bit disrupting if Google did something like that. GrapheneOS would have to shift gears and look for the next best hardware device to support and hope that it doesn't do the same.
20:25:33 <strcat[m]> we're working on making an automated installer using WebUSB
20:26:00 <strcat[m]> joltman: it wouldn't be very disruptive because it wouldn't change existing devices
20:26:17 <strcat[m]> and in the future we want hardware built to run GrapheneOS by a company listening to our feedback closely
20:26:28 <strcat[m]> working on it
20:27:11 <joltman[m]> That's great. It's ideal. Can't wait for that to come to fruition.
20:29:35 <catfish[m]> Hi guys how long would you expect to wait for GOS to flash?
20:30:14 <catfish[m]> Pixel 3a using arch
20:30:48 <strcat[m]> 3a storage is slow so... a few minutes?
20:32:31 <catfish[m]> Been about ten minutes now. I'll wait 😁
20:32:50 <strcat> catfish[m]: sounds like it's not working unless you see it making progress
20:32:58 <strcat> unless you have some ridiculously slow USB setup
20:33:01 <strcat> sounds like it's not working
20:33:33 <catfish[m]> Would I see progress on the computer or the phone?
20:33:46 <strcat> computer
20:34:01 <strcat> it outputs text with the progress as it goes
20:34:49 <catfish[m]> Okay thanks. It's said nothing I'll start again...
20:54:29 <ATliens296> hi
20:59:39 <goblinslayer[m]> So I flashed the wrong zip in fastboot can someone point me in the right direction as how to proceed? Already rebound the google drivers to the pixel 3a by manually pointing to a folder containg those after selecting the pixel in device management (windows)
21:02:31 <catfish[m]> Pretty sure I've done everything correctly. Tried two different cables, a Sony and a OnePlus (usbA to usbC) in three different USB slots. No output from ./flash-all.sh
21:02:31 <catfish[m]> Any suggestions what else I could try?
21:06:52 * fll[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KfGhOPLbTOTfYfqqZGeUfDbO/message.txt >
21:07:45 <flou_srs[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: okay so you said that OS based solutions to limit password bruteforcing is a weak system
21:07:59 <flou_srs[m]> If I make my password 20-40 characters long
21:08:12 <flou_srs[m]> Completely randomized and computer generated
21:08:19 <flou_srs[m]> Would it still be unsafe?
21:08:41 <flou_srs[m]> My main concern is that they can get to the files by avoiding having to type the password at all
21:09:04 * catfish[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/hrCwIYYoHwuaefsDBMfXimAX/message.txt >
21:09:48 <fll[m]> Hmm...sounds good so far
21:10:26 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: if the profile is inactive, then all the data is at rest
21:11:00 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: if they exploit the OS while the profile is active (logged in) then they could get data that's not protected with the keystore while locked
21:11:20 <flou_srs[m]> Okay so if my phone is completely turned off it is safe
21:11:22 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
21:11:25 <strcat[m]> each profile has separate encryption keys
21:11:43 <strcat[m]> secondary profiles have an 'end session' option added by us
21:11:53 <strcat[m]> which purges the encryption keys (it's a standard OS feature but usually not exposed to users)
21:12:08 <strcat[m]> and makes it like it wasn't logged in again
21:12:16 <strcat[m]> purges from memory + hardware registers, etc.
21:12:37 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: there is a strong key derivation, which helps makes passwords stronger
21:12:47 <strcat[m]> and there's the secure element which throttles attempts
21:12:55 <ruby888[m]> i have a pixel 5 can i install grapheneos without bricking it ( i know its not supported as yet.
21:13:00 <strcat[m]> the rate limiting by the secure element is explained there in detail
21:13:08 <strcat[m]> ruby888: not without building it yourself
21:13:13 <strcat[m]> and doing work to get it ported over
21:13:55 <flou_srs[m]> Thank you a lot, so for security I would have to store my files and messages on a second profile?
21:13:59 <strcat[m]> flou_srs:  in theory, the secure element could also support the limit on # of attempts, but it wouldn't help as much as you think because it already throttles it to 1 day / attempt and they will KNOW that the secure element does that
21:14:21 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: so they won't try to brute force and trigger the wipe
21:14:28 <strcat[m]> they'll leave it sitting around until they have a secure element exploit, if ever
21:14:58 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: our recommendation for max security is you use the owner profile primarily to activate the device after booting
21:15:02 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: and to create/delete other profiles
21:15:09 <strcat[m]> flou_srs: divide things up into different user profiles
21:15:32 <strcat[m]> and you can end session when you're done with them if you don't want them to be running in the background
21:15:39 <strcat[m]> which puts them back at  rest
21:15:59 * flou_srs[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/rzZtQYISTKIpkmOUrkkFFUPm/message.txt >
21:16:02 <flou_srs[m]> Would that be safe?
21:16:28 <strcat[m]> it makes sense to divide it up by identity
21:16:36 <ctrl> hi, there is any ways to run grapheneos on other brand phones than google?
21:16:42 <strcat[m]> owner profile: to activate device after booting, and to manage profiles
21:16:43 <faxing[m]> Private, Public, other
21:16:46 <faxing[m]> might be more apt
21:16:48 <strcat[m]> a secondary profile for everyday usage
21:16:56 <strcat[m]> and then special things can go into their own profiles
21:17:19 <flou_srs[m]> Okay
21:17:20 <strcat[m]> so for example, if you use some other pseudonym as an identity online, put that all in a dedicated profile with it used everywhere
21:17:20 <faxing[m]>  * might be more apt
21:17:20 <faxing[m]> but im not a security researcher or expert - so don't listen to me, just an idea
21:17:36 <catfish[m]> > <@catfishes:matrix.org> Version is 30.0.5
21:17:37 <catfish[m]> > Devices gives serial number of phone
21:17:37 <catfish[m]> Should I try using sudo or is that a bad idea?
21:17:43 <strcat[m]> so that you have separate contacts and everything for it in the profile data
21:17:47 <strcat[m]> you could divide up personal and work
21:17:58 <faxing[m]> Should I password protect each profile with a unique password?
21:18:03 <strcat[m]> up to you how you do it
21:18:23 <faxing[m]>  * Should each profile be password protected with strong, unique passwords
21:18:27 <flou_srs[m]> Understood
21:18:31 <flou_srs[m]> Thank you for the advice
21:18:54 <strcat[m]> faxing: they'll have their own encryption keys even with a different password, and your password can't be obtained based on exploiting the OS when a profile using it is active
21:19:14 <strcat[m]> it's up to you if you want to protect against someone watching you enter it, etc. with separate passwords
21:19:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hello ctrl, From the FAQ: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices this is your best way of looking at it. GrapheneOS will compile for and run on targets that it does not support officially, however it does require someone to maintain them. This is where the bulk of the work is.
21:19:38 <strcat[m]> here's an example of a setup
21:19:59 <TheJollyRoger> catfish[m]: You will not need to use fastboot with sudo if your udev rules are properly configured and set up.
21:20:00 <strcat[m]> owner profile (password A): activate after first boot, manage other profiles
21:20:28 <ruby888[m]> i was told by another user GrapheneOS would work on the pixel 5 but there is a few bugs that need resoving, is that false?
21:20:29 <strcat[m]> everyday usage profile (password A): used for normal usage
21:20:44 <strcat[m]>  * everyday usage profile (password B): used for normal usage
21:21:00 <strcat[m]> (made a typo)
21:21:15 <TheJollyRoger> ruby888[m]: right now, a maintainer is needed to step up to do the work. All the other maintainers are currently busy maintaining the devices that are currently supported.
21:21:41 <strcat[m]> faxing: the benefit you get from those 2 having different passwords is that now you can boot up and unlock the device
21:21:44 <strcat[m]> faxing: and use it
21:21:53 <strcat[m]> faxing: without entering your password for the sensitive everyday usage profile
21:22:09 <catfish[m]> <TheJollyRoger "catfish: You will not need to us"> Okay thanks. Just does nothing after ./flash-all.sh
21:22:14 <strcat[m]> faxing: so you could avoid risking being recorded entering your important passphrase
21:22:17 <TheJollyRoger> ruby888[m]: the thing is, getting an operating system to simply boot once on a device is fairly simple, but actually *supporting* the device in a way that either meets or exceeds the security properties of the commercial release is actually very much a full-ime job.
21:22:47 <strcat[m]> faxing: and then you could add more profiles if you have things you want to keep separate, with their own shared data (contacts, home directory, etc.)
21:22:58 <strcat[m]> faxing: and their own instance of each app
21:23:08 <flou_srs[m]> Is there a way to support grapheneOS by buying a device from a certain certified store?
21:23:13 <strcat[m]> faxing: so for example, you could have a 2nd Signal number on another profile, with diff contacts
21:23:14 <ruby888[m]> the hardware on a pixel 5 is not incredibly differnet to a pixel 5, how much work would it take by one of you geniuses to get it up and running?
21:23:18 <TheJollyRoger> catfish[m]: there may be a problem with the cable or your setup, I might not be the best person to ask about this though.
21:23:21 <TheJollyRoger> *very much a full-time job.
21:23:30 <ruby888[m]> Pixel 4 sorry
21:24:11 <TheJollyRoger> ruby888[m]: like I said, maintaining it sustainably is very much a full-time job.
21:24:11 <strcat[m]> faxing: for example, maybe you play some online game and people there don't know your real name, etc. and you want to talk to them on Signal
21:24:14 <ruby888[m]> oh ok thanks jollyroger
21:24:24 <strcat[m]> so you have a 2nd Signal in another profile with separate contacts, 2nd number, etc.
21:24:40 <strcat[m]> and since it's a whole profile, it's consistent between apps
21:24:46 <strcat[m]> apps can';t share data or communicate across profiles
21:24:53 <strcat[m]> and yeah each one gets a separate encryption key - if you really want you can use separate passphrases, but it's not mandatory
21:25:02 <strcat[m]> and the separate encryption keys help you even if you use 1 passphrase for each
21:25:09 <TheJollyRoger> ruby888[m]: people working at vendors are generally paid 150,000 per annum /minimum/ to do this full time and the GrapheneOS developers are doing this as volunteers. That's the kind of work it takes to support a device sustainably.
21:25:16 <strcat[m]> since the passphrase does not stay around after you enter it
21:25:39 <strcat[m]> 4 profiles with same passphrase, they get your phone while 2 were logged in
21:25:48 <strcat[m]> they can't access the data for the 2 inactive ones
21:25:58 <strcat[m]> unless they observed you entering it or whatever
21:26:34 <strcat[m]> they have their own enc keys even if you use the same passphrase and exploiting the OS / firmware while one is logged in doesn't leak the passphrase at all
21:27:09 <strcat[m]> the advantage to multiple passphrases is avoiding compromising the other profiles if you are recorded entering the passphrase somehow
21:27:21 <TheJollyRoger> ruby888[m]: so if you'd like Pixel 5 support, the best thing you can do is sponsor the project by hiring a developer to work full time on GrapheneOS. Remember, GrapheneOS is not a business where you put your money in the hat, and get something out. Instead, GrapheneOS is an open source development project: the idea being that when everyone puts something in, everyone gets out something out
21:27:22 <TheJollyRoger> that's more than the sum of everyone's contributions.
21:27:25 <strcat[m]> really up to you how you want to do things
21:27:34 <strcat[m]> I think https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption does a good job explaining it
21:27:45 <strcat[m]> could add an explanation that even with the same passphrases, the separate encryption keys help
21:27:53 <faxing[m]> Wow I just came back -- that's so helpful, thank you so so much for all of the information
21:28:00 <faxing[m]> I really appreciate it
21:28:02 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: yessir.
21:28:22 <faxing[m]> Why can't all devs be that helpful lol
21:28:30 <strcat[m]> the separate encryption keys per profile and ability to end session on secondary profiles
21:28:36 <strcat[m]> is what you get from filesystem-based encryption
21:29:26 <fll[m]> catfish: not advising you to use sudo but if I was in your place I'd see if it does the trick ;) Like TJR said, udev rules might be the culprit
21:29:35 <strcat[m]> also can be very explicitly used to put non-sensitive data as 'device encrypted' so that it can be available before unlocking owner profile
21:29:40 <strcat[m]> as an example
21:30:07 <strcat[m]> a keyboard app can use this to function before you unlock
21:30:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> <faxing[m] "Why can't all devs be that helpf"> This is not a fair question. You don't know with what commitments they decided to make the software available, the current circumstances in their life, or their relative wellbeing
21:30:20 <strcat[m]> but any learned data, etc. would not be available
21:30:22 <strcat[m]> and maybe settings wouldn't be available
21:31:04 <strcat[m]> and an accessibility service for people that are blind would use it, as another example
21:31:18 <faxing[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "This is not a fair question. You"> it was more just a compliment to him going above and beyond, less a general statement about developers and their life commitments...
21:31:21 <strcat[m]> previously, those accessibility services had to disable credential-based encryption and that's no longer a thing now
21:32:03 <strcat[m]> faxing: so, before, there was simply 1 encryption key, and a passphrase entered at boot - could still do an emergency call, etc. before then as required by law
21:32:10 <strcat[m]> faxing: and then until reboot, it's in memory
21:32:14 <strcat[m]> that's how dm-crypt works
21:32:33 <strcat[m]> and really, that's honestly not as useful as it seems
21:32:54 <strcat[m]> because 99% of the time your device has the encryption key in memory
21:32:59 <strcat[m]> at least with the new way
21:33:13 <strcat[m]> you can use user profiles to try to keep data at rest
21:33:35 <strcat[m]> it's still full disk encryption
21:33:45 <strcat[m]> but filesystem-based implementation rather than a block layer
21:33:50 <strcat[m]> which makes it more granular
21:34:11 <catfish[m]> <fll[m] "catfish: not advising you to use"> Hmm sudo didn't work either. I'll try again tomorrow. Thanks for all replies.
21:34:36 <strcat[m]> metadata blocks are encrypted, and data blocks are encrypted with the per-profile keys
21:34:47 <strcat[m]> file names are encrypted with per-profile keys too
21:35:04 <strcat[m]> so the owner profile can delete all files of a user
21:35:22 <strcat[m]> without it being active
21:35:48 <strcat[m]> (anyway better explanation in the faq)
21:37:06 <samdebatin> Does anybody know if pixel 1 images are still available?
21:37:14 <faxing[m]> Wow okay - this is a lot of really helpful information, I really appreciate you taking the time to explain all of this.
21:38:00 <strcat[m]> samdebatin: super outdated and insecure at this point
21:38:01 <faxing[m]> I've just been using one main profile up until now (well two but the second one is really never used), but I'll start trying to compartmentalize more.
21:38:32 <strcat[m]> faxing: even just using 2: owner and a main usage one, with same passphrase
21:38:35 <strcat[m]> is useful
21:38:57 <strcat[m]> ideally diff passphrase so you can unlock your phone without someone recording your sensitive passphrase
21:39:28 <strcat[m]> and then, can go from there
21:39:36 <faxing[m]> And the owner profile pretty much is just for booting the phone and general management, correct?
21:39:42 <strcat[m]> yes
21:39:58 <strcat[m]> and maybe use in a pinch where you don't want to enter an important passphrase after booting
21:40:07 <faxing[m]> Right now I'm not too worried about shoulder-surfing due to the whole pandemic thing going on, but I'll certainly work on it
21:40:33 <faxing[m]> <strcat[m] "and maybe use in a pinch where y"> You mean if you're in a public area with cameras, or?
21:40:41 <strcat[m]> yes
21:41:02 <faxing[m]> Ah okay
21:41:28 <faxing[m]> My only problem is that I wouldn't be able to use Signal in public but I could try to get used to it
21:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> samdebatin: The Pixel 1 is depreciated now, unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it. I don't know if I have the images anymore, let me check.
21:42:19 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 also obsolete but we still do extended support releases for it
21:42:20 <strcat[m]> can see we did one this month
21:42:26 <strcat[m]> but it's insecure and shouldn't be used anymore either
21:42:32 <strcat[m]> Pixel 1 is super insecure at this point though
21:43:03 <strcat[m]> our releases for the Pixel 2 are just a stopgap for people who haven't yet moved on
21:43:28 <strcat[m]> we don't really work on Pixel 2 support anymore and we don't consider it officially supported
21:43:38 <samdebatin> I know they're not officially supported anymore, but I have an old pixel 1 that would be more secure with graphene than with stock
21:43:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The Pixel 1 will be forever frozen at November 2019's patch level, since Qualcomm stopped supplying firmware updates, and the Pixel 2 will be frozen at November 2020 patch level.
21:43:44 <faxing[m]>  * My only problem is that I wouldn't be able to use Signal in public, right? I could try to get used to it but it certainly wouldn't be preferable
21:44:08 <strcat[m]> and note it's 2020-11-01 for Pixel 2 , not 2020-11-05
21:44:20 <TheJollyRoger> samdebatin: honestly, I think you'd be better off sending that device to the recycler's.
21:44:21 <strcat[m]> last stock OS release was 2020-10-05 patch level
21:44:33 <faxing[m]> Again, thank you so much for all of the help and information
21:44:41 <samdebatin> Hah alright just figured I'd ask, thanks for the help
21:44:46 <faxing[m]> Have a great rest of your day
21:44:58 <strcat[m]> faxing: we don't really have specific advice can just tell people what's available
21:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> faxing[m]: yarr, fare thee well!
21:45:02 <strcat[m]> and they can decide if it's useful to them
21:45:11 <strcat[m]> cya
21:45:14 <strcat[m]> taking a break for a bit
21:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: arr, see ye in a bit!
21:45:39 <TheJollyRoger> samdebatin: Yeah, if you're looking to get a phone right now the best value for the money is the 4a.
21:46:23 <TheJollyRoger> For around $400 depending on where you live, it'll be supported for almost three more years.
21:46:40 <samdebatin> Yeah I would but I don't have the money
21:46:51 <TheJollyRoger> (NOT the 4a5G! If you flash the 4a image on the 4a5G it will result in a permanent and irreversible brick.)
21:46:59 <strcat[m]> faxing:  and 1 more thing before I go for a bit: worth noting that a profile gets reliably wiped as a unit when it's deleted
21:47:12 <strcat[m]> faxing: since the secure element reliably deletes the Weaver token used as part of encryption key derivation
21:47:14 <samdebatin> Also I'm sick of phones having giant screens, 5.8 inches is huge for me
21:47:20 <faxing[m]> Oh okay!
21:47:28 <faxing[m]> That's helpful to know, thank you
21:47:40 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. I'll add that too.
21:47:44 <strcat[m]> so, even if they get your passphrase somehow, they can't recover data from a deleted profile, even if the SSD doesn't actually overwrite any of the data
21:47:50 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: that's in there already
21:47:51 <TheJollyRoger> *I'll add that remark too.
21:47:59 <TheJollyRoger> Oh whew. Thanks!!!
21:48:12 <strcat[m]> faxing: the faq section has an explanation of how weaver works
21:48:30 <strcat[m]> basically it makes a main token from your passphrase with scrypt and then uses it for various other things
21:48:44 <strcat[m]> each one of those uses will do a sha512 with a personalization string
21:49:02 <strcat[m]> to get a new token derived from it
21:49:19 <strcat[m]> one of those is passed to Weaver to authenticate and get the Weaver token needed as part of encryption key derivation
21:49:36 <catfish[m]> Woo hoo got it to work! Had to issue command ./flash-all.sh then reboot bootloader on device and it worked!
21:49:41 <strcat[m]> another with a diff personalization string is used as part of the encryption key derivation alongside the Weaver token
21:49:52 <strcat[m]> and then other personalization strings are used for different things
21:50:10 <strcat[m]> like unlocking the keystore (which actually happens for EVERY unlock - because keys can be put at rest when locked)
21:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> catfish[m]: it's working? Awesome, awesome! Welcome aboard the ship! Don't forget to re lock bootloader after you've tested it to make sure it boots, and then you can turn OEM unlocking off to prevent someone from futzing with the phone later.
21:51:47 <fll[m]> catfish: yay!
21:51:48 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-11.0.0_r27/services/core/java/com/android/server/locksettings/SyntheticPasswordManager.java#760
21:53:13 <strcat[m]> pwdToken is the main token derived from the scrypt-derived key based on your passphrase
21:53:52 <catfish[m]> TheJollyRoger: @strcat:matrix.org fll Thanks guys 🙏
21:54:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
21:54:14 <strcat[m]> weaver secret is the secret token it gets back from the secure element when it sends the correct weaver key (derived from scrypt-derived key from your passphrase with a diff hash personalization string, so the secure element doesn't get your passphrase at all)
21:56:14 <strcat[m]> weaver reliably wipes the slot for the profile so then that's totally gone after wiping a profile (they're ALL gone after a factory reset)
21:56:56 <strcat[m]> and that part there where it combines the pwd token and weaver secret, is the main thing the OS passes to the TEE for the hardware bound key derivation
21:57:07 <strcat[m]> without that, it's missing a high entropy key needed to derive the key encryption key
21:57:10 <faxing[m]> So, since I've been using the owner profile for everything since the beginning, should I factory reset my device.
21:57:13 <faxing[m]>  * So, since I've been using the owner profile for everything since the beginning, should I factory reset my device?
21:57:28 <strcat[m]> faxing: you could if you really wanted
21:57:39 <faxing[m]> I mean does it really affect anything?
21:57:59 <strcat[m]> faxing: if you did a factory reset, you make sure none of the data on the device is recoverable
21:58:15 <strcat[m]> if you don't, then in theory, maybe some data that's deleted in the owner profile lingers around
21:58:19 <strcat[m]> in practice, it mostly won't
21:58:21 <strcat[m]> because of TRIM
21:58:56 <strcat[m]> basically the way profiles work provides "secure erase" per-profile
21:59:10 <strcat[m]> unlike only having it for an SSD as a whole which is not really usable anyway since you'd wipe the OS off it
21:59:25 <strcat[m]> Weaver is missing on most Android devices
21:59:41 <strcat[m]> one of the things we expect from other devices
21:59:43 <strcat[m]> which they don't do
21:59:56 <strcat[m]> on other devices, Android uses this 'secdiscardable' hack
22:00:12 <strcat[m]> it generates a random 16kiB file per profile
22:00:21 <strcat[m]> it uses the hash of that as an input for key derivation
22:00:47 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't have any hardware-based exponentially increasing throttling or the other benefits of that
22:01:16 <strcat[m]> but if the SSD manages to delete at least 16 bytes of that file properly when it's deleted
22:01:17 <strcat[m]> the key can't be recovered
22:01:31 <blk> Has anyone been able to get native visual voicemail working?
22:01:49 <strcat[m]> blk: got fixes for Verizon, etc. with that in the next release
22:01:51 <faxing[m]> again thank you for being so helpful, it's surprisingly difficult to find reliable information on things like this.
22:02:05 <faxing[m]> <blk "Has anyone been able to get nati"> nope, tried for months on mint and no dice
22:02:28 <strcat[m]> blk: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Dialer/commit/609d5ef4dcd3f128c91c71a278a27009ed453ae1
22:02:40 <blk> OK - also on Mint. Will look forward to testing it out in the new release!
22:02:41 <strcat[m]> check if your carrier is there
22:03:05 <strcat[m]> based on the mccmnc entries
22:03:17 <blk> strcat: yes, looks like T-Mobile is included.
22:04:04 <strcat[m]> pretty sad that what some of those configs do is disable TLS
22:04:09 <strcat[m]> to make it work on that carrier
22:04:15 <strcat[m]> but yeah
22:04:21 <strcat[m]> traditional calls are insecure as hell anyway
22:04:35 <strcat[m]> anyways back later for real now
22:13:25 <faxing[m]> wonder why t-mobile works but mint doesnt
22:13:35 <faxing[m]> some of my vms show up but none of the new ones
22:16:05 <GenericIdentifie> Hi
22:16:17 <faxing[m]> Hi!
22:16:19 <faxing[m]> Welcome
22:18:13 <GenericIdentifie> Just wanted to say "Donate to graphene os" Graphene os is awesome
22:18:20 <GenericIdentifie> Its secure, fast and reliable
22:20:10 <GenericIdentifie> I use LTE-only mode, VPNs and
22:20:25 <GenericIdentifie> I think the PDF reader could be a little better, with the pdfs 'fit to screen'
22:20:34 <GenericIdentifie> Kinda like 'ReadEra' App
22:22:10 <randomUser> good afternoon all
22:22:22 <randomUser> I have a questions about backup and restore can anyone chime in?
22:23:44 <randomUser> well i started using graphene now I just want to test the backup restore feature incase I have to do this in the future? I have backed up with my priv words, I cant help but notice anywhere I could restore a back up.
22:23:50 <randomUser> how would I do this?
22:24:52 <GenericIdentifie> What data are you trying to backup? Phone Numbers, photos?
22:26:06 <randomUser> pretty much everything apps , I have already done nextcloud and I do this once I install and app or make changes, etc.
22:26:41 <randomUser> but where is the restore feature? and Would I lose what is residing in my Downloads folder on the phone?
22:27:16 <GenericIdentifie> I mean, Id just backup phone numbers to paper document personally
22:27:24 <GenericIdentifie> The rest, apps photos can be easily re-downloaded
22:27:47 <randomUser> for example.. i have a few saves web address on the graphene version of chrome.
22:28:24 <GenericIdentifie> Ok so save all the urls onto a text file
22:28:26 <randomUser> Is that on the next cloud backup? its just so vague in the docs. and i scoured the internet looking for the littlest of answers.
22:28:32 <GenericIdentifie> and then copy paste the text file into pastebin tpye site
22:28:43 <randomUser> thats a good idea.
22:28:47 <GenericIdentifie> yeah
22:29:02 <GenericIdentifie> Make a pastebin and paste all your favorite legal URLs
22:29:13 <randomUser> LOL , right!
22:29:28 <randomUser> so where does the backup feature fit into all of this?
22:29:42 <GenericIdentifie> IDK, but I told you how I backup data
22:29:56 <GenericIdentifie> I write phone numbers to paper, and save all URLs onto a pastebin link and url shortener
22:30:02 <GenericIdentifie> then write down the url shortened link onot paper
22:30:05 <GenericIdentifie> onto
22:30:27 <GenericIdentifie> you can turn off auto-sync, which is on by default, and saves battery when off
22:30:34 <GenericIdentifie> as a side data point
22:30:47 <randomUser> I like your model.
22:31:10 <GenericIdentifie> Yes, Phone numbers to paper, Links to pastebin, anon.to url shortener, written down on paper
22:31:12 <randomUser> gives me a refrence of sorts that I need to put this into perspective
22:31:15 <GenericIdentifie> Multiple backups
22:31:18 <nscnt[m]> randomUser: Seedvault back ups apps and app data (where allowed). You're able to use the backup when setting up your device with the SetupWizard.
22:31:18 <GenericIdentifie> Yes
22:31:55 <GenericIdentifie> backups may glitch or be incomplete restore, best bet is to manually copy inmportant info onto paper or pastebin
22:32:41 <randomUser> nscnt[m] : gee, thanks I couldnt help myself, A lost phone is anyones nightmare.
22:33:12 <randomUser> would I loose my downloads folder too? right
22:33:19 <GenericIdentifie> Maybe you can ask the NSA for the last known Cell tower ping
22:33:33 <randomUser> glitch , didnt think of that.
22:33:52 <randomUser> No Such Agency
22:34:32 <GenericIdentifie> National Secret-Global-Wiretapping Agency
22:34:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hello randomUser, right now, Seedvault has to be done when the phone is first provisioned, since it restores some system settings. I've been told that because of this, this can cause problems after the launcher, so they're still working on a way to fix these problems.
22:35:01 <GenericIdentifie> I can personally reccomend Caylx VPN, ProtonVPN, and IVPN apps on Graphene OS work great
22:35:15 <GenericIdentifie> therefore, backup is still under construction =)
22:35:25 <GenericIdentifie> *Men at work*
22:36:03 <TheJollyRoger> *sound of hammering and powersaw in the background*
22:36:27 <TheJollyRoger> randomUser: Note that seedvault will *not* back up your shared storage, so you'll have to do that yourself.
22:36:42 <randomUser> I've tried Hide.me with mix results and Nord kinda freezes. slows everything down a bunch!
22:36:54 <GenericIdentifie> yes hide.me keeps logs and Nord is over-crowded
22:37:01 <GenericIdentifie> ProtonVPN has free servers and are fast!
22:37:05 <GenericIdentifie> I reccomend ProtonVPN
22:37:10 <GenericIdentifie> For security
22:37:21 <GenericIdentifie> For ultimate security I reccomend IVPN, Wireguard Protocol and Ukraine VPN node
22:37:21 <randomUser> puling the trigger on Proton Then, I was juggling a few to test
22:37:36 <GenericIdentifie> ProtonVPN Free servers are all in heavily-wiretapped countries such as Netherlands and USa
22:37:53 <GenericIdentifie> But the company is trustworthy as far as I can see and the app and encryption is well-built
22:38:19 <GenericIdentifie> ProtonVPN encryption will prevent MITM, traffic modification from your phone to the VPN server, at least
22:38:24 <randomUser> havent tried IVPN
22:38:30 <GenericIdentifie> But for ultimate privacy, I reccomend IVPN for ultimate anonymity
22:38:37 <GenericIdentifie> Wireguard protocol, Ukraine server
22:38:52 <GenericIdentifie> Multi-hop Iceland > Ukraine OpenVPN port 1443 is top shelf, antitracker on
22:39:03 <randomUser> I read mixed reviews about wireguard, cant quite find anything out.
22:39:15 <GenericIdentifie> Its added to linux officially
22:39:25 <randomUser> well that settles it then.
22:39:27 <GenericIdentifie> I consider it trustworthy and wireg passed a 3rd party audit I think
22:39:45 <GenericIdentifie> Mullvad is another good vpn company
22:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys. If you're discussing VPNs, I'd like to refer you to the offtopic channel, #grapheneos-offtopic for those types of discussions, they're sort of out of this room's purview.
22:39:53 <GenericIdentifie> ok
22:39:54 <axorz[m]> <randomUser "I read mixed reviews about wireg"> Wireguard works really good on a phone
22:40:09 <GenericIdentifie> yes WG is super fast and uses more modern crypto :)
22:40:55 <GenericIdentifie> ProtonVPN free is good for 90% of use cases, I'd use IVPN ($60 per year) if I wanted ultimate privacy though.
22:41:21 <randomUser> so wire guard is built into IVPN?
22:41:38 <GenericIdentifie> yeah IVPN supports it and Wireguard comes with the IVPN app
22:41:47 <GenericIdentifie> You can get IVPN from the ivpn.net website directly, or from F-Droid
22:43:04 <GenericIdentifie> I have 4 VPN apps on my phone, ProtonVPN Free, Calyx VPN Free, MullVad, IVPN, and Tor Browser =)
22:44:48 <randomUser> dumping Hide and Nord, I figured something wrong with Nord, too damn slow for some reason.
22:45:12 <randomUser> IVPN pro or regular btw?
22:45:15 <GenericIdentifie> yes that is a common NordVPn complaint
22:45:22 <GenericIdentifie> Pro has double-hop so 2 servers
22:45:35 <GenericIdentifie> Thats the primaray advantage, along with being usable on 7 devices at once
22:45:45 <GenericIdentifie> you can set Iceland to Ukraine for example
22:45:49 <GenericIdentifie> TCP 1443 port
22:45:56 <GenericIdentifie> So you get better privacy/secrutiy with pro
22:46:06 <GenericIdentifie> If you can afford it easily, Pro has double-hop
22:46:21 <GenericIdentifie> You can set custom double-hop
22:46:25 <randomUser> if I could just buy it with crypto , hold on let me check the site
22:46:41 <GenericIdentifie> Yes it accepts BTC and U can use XMR.to to send XMR>BTC
22:47:06 <GenericIdentifie> Do you have any online money making advice? I was supposed to mine Bitcoin in 2009 but forgot I coudl have 1 trillion dollars if I had just mined bitocin for 1 year back then.
22:47:34 <randomUser> I lost 1 bit coin back in 2009, hacked some how.
22:47:40 <GenericIdentifie> Mining bitcoin in 2009 for 1 year could equal you to get 2.6 million BTC todays value 1 trillion ish
22:47:40 <randomUser> could have been $$$$ right now.
22:47:44 <GenericIdentifie> yes
22:48:08 <GenericIdentifie> 1 year of letting you computer CPU compute mathematical equations = $1 trillion in 2009 mining btc
22:48:13 <GenericIdentifie> Once in a lifetime opportunity.
22:48:16 <randomUser> If anyone can remember, I bought 1 bit coin back then for 17usd
22:48:31 <GenericIdentifie> I remember when 10,000 BTC = $50
22:48:41 <randomUser> jesus!
22:48:57 <GenericIdentifie> Bitcointalk user smoketoomuch had 10,000 BTC for $50, no-one bought it
22:49:05 <randomUser> some people are rich out there for sure, I would have had my wallet in a thumbdrive somewhere no even online at all.
22:49:11 <GenericIdentifie> That 10k btc today would be worth 400$mill
22:49:30 <GenericIdentifie> As long as you backup your wallet seed, you can restore it even with hardware failure
22:49:45 <GenericIdentifie> $50 10,000 btc into $400 million just waiting 10 years.
22:50:06 <randomUser> ill take what ever i could right now if I have 10k
22:50:11 <GenericIdentifie> I could of spent 5 minutes at $50 and ended up with $400m
22:50:20 <GenericIdentifie> 5 minutes to be set for life
22:51:50 <GenericIdentifie> Then, I could buy an underground bunker in Finland and spend my days reading books in my nuke-proof bunker
22:51:59 <GenericIdentifie> All for spending $50 and 5 minutes of time
22:52:03 <GenericIdentifie> I could be set for life
22:52:15 <GenericIdentifie> Now I'll have to work the rest of my life to barely get by
22:53:41 <GenericIdentifie> I think good investments these days are rural farming land
22:54:37 <GenericIdentifie> Meet me in Offtopic room
22:56:50 <GenericIdentifie> Nice
22:56:53 <GenericIdentifie> This room is 'the tits'
22:58:33 <randomUser> rural farming
22:58:38 <randomUser> off grid?
23:00:24 <GenericIdentifie> yes
23:00:36 <GenericIdentifie> you can buy land for cheap in some states, then build an underground bunker
23:00:57 <GenericIdentifie> Think about this comparison
23:01:12 <GenericIdentifie> Buy land in San Diego, CA for $1 mill, build a house for $1 mill
23:01:28 <ejaculation[m]> Rural farming is the future.
23:01:28 <GenericIdentifie> Or, buy land in rural Utah, $1000, build a cabin for $5000
23:01:54 <GenericIdentifie> Some people spend 1/4 of their income just paying for an apartment they dont own and just sleep in mostly
23:02:23 <GenericIdentifie> I'd rather live 1 mile outside of some medium size town
23:02:30 <GenericIdentifie> Build a small cabin on some cheap land
23:02:38 <GenericIdentifie> And work as a governmental agent protecting the people
23:02:45 <GenericIdentifie> pocketing majority of income
23:02:52 <GenericIdentifie> instead of spending it on a $500,000 house and rent etc
23:03:03 <dar_gomml[m]> <GenericIdentifie "Some people spend 1/4 of their i"> horribly offtopic, but 1/4 is a quite  small amount nowadays
23:03:06 <GenericIdentifie> I can live in an Amish Shed for $8k 2 story building with multiple rooms
23:03:18 <GenericIdentifie> yes exactly my point
23:03:34 <GenericIdentifie> Cheap land and Amish Sheds can get u a 2 story house on your own land for under $10k
23:03:53 <GenericIdentifie> Working minimum wage you can have your own land and 2 story house in under 1 year
23:04:16 <GenericIdentifie> Compare my plan ^ to the traditional "Pay off a 30 year mortage etc"
23:07:53 <GenericIdentifie> Then, you can even live without utilities, such as charging your phone at work etc
23:08:08 <GenericIdentifie> using a woodfire stove to cook food purchased same-day
23:08:24 <GenericIdentifie> I've calculated the lifetime supply of water
23:08:26 <GenericIdentifie> needed to live
23:08:44 <GenericIdentifie> 120 years old maximum biological age, 120 years x 365 days per year =
23:08:45 <randomUser> Thanks all for the help, Gen Identifie  great things learned alot . peace
23:09:11 <GenericIdentifie> 43800 gallons of water for 1 human to live 120 years
23:09:26 <GenericIdentifie> thats just for drinking, not including cooking, bathing, spilling it etc
