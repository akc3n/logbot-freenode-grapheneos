00:09:28 <RoyValentine[m]> That is what I see currently.
00:13:49 <dazinism> RoyValentine Maybe try force stop and then see if it works
00:14:04 <dazinism> Also maybe restart the phone
00:14:25 <RoyValentine[m]> Trying that now.
00:18:21 <RoyValentine[m]> Still shows the same after that.
00:25:25 <RoyValentine[m]> Not sure what I should be looking for in adb when navigating to the back up screen.

00:28:41 <rny[m]> please file an issue on github
00:28:56 <RoyValentine[m]> SeedVault or GrapheneOS?
00:29:10 <rny[m]> this is an OS issue
00:29:29 <rny[m]> the transport should have been registered
00:29:33 <rny[m]> not sure what is going on
00:31:34 <rny[m]> RoyValentine: when was the last time you updated?
00:32:03 <dazinism> RoyValentine: may be able to register via adb - hang on....
00:32:15 <dazinism> Let me find a link
00:32:17 <rny[m]> hmm
00:32:23 <rny[m]> we havent even pushed out that code change

00:33:29 <rny[m]> RoyValentine: did you do anything funny?
00:33:47 <rny[m]> or this is flashing the grapheneos without any modifications?
00:34:41 <RoyValentine[m]> I flashed this with graphene without modifications back in September or something. My last backup on SeedVault happened around 12/18/2020 or sometime mid December.
00:35:23 <rny[m]> when was the last time you updated the OS?
00:36:15 <nullnode[m]> when you first moved to Graphene did you import old content with SeedVault?
00:36:16 <RoyValentine[m]> What do you mean? I run syncthing to backup the local seed vault to a local network and it shows it was last backed up mid December.
00:36:37 <RoyValentine[m]> I haven't done anything since installing back in September and have updates on Stable OTA.
00:36:43 <rny[m]> the OTA updates, do you let it update every month?
00:36:46 <rny[m]> ok.
00:36:53 <rny[m]> please create an issue on github
00:36:59 <rny[m]> this is something that needs to be looked at
00:37:02 <dazinism> RoyValentine: maybe see what happens using some of these https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/issues/77#issuecomment-696752898
00:37:48 <dazinism> Might help understand whats happening?
00:38:03 <rny[m]> RoyValentine: do you use multi-user?
00:38:17 <RoyValentine[m]> No I do not.
00:40:35 <RoyValentine[m]> Should I try what that github comment is talking about?
00:47:16 <dazinism> RoyValentine: actually, not sure its going to help
00:47:22 <dazinism> Could try
00:47:32 <dazinism> adb shell bmgr --user 00 list transports
00:47:49 <dazinism> Sorry.... just one 0
00:48:03 <dazinism> adb shell bmgr --user 0 list transports
00:48:43 <dazinism> Expect it'll list seedvaul
00:49:14 <RoyValentine[m]> ➜  ~ adb shell bmgr --user 0 list transports
00:49:14 <RoyValentine[m]>     com.android.localtransport/.LocalTransport
00:53:20 <RoyValentine[m]> Ran logcat again and saw a different fatal exception as well. Not sure if you want that info?
00:53:21 <dazinism> RoyValentine: think it should list seedvault there
00:54:13 <dazinism> adb shell bmgr --user 0 transport com.stevesoltys.seedvault.transport.ConfigurableBackupTransport
00:54:38 <dazinism> Then try listing again

01:05:29 <dazinism> RoyValentine: yeah sorry, not sure. Looking at the logcat dumps in that github issue it looks like it should list seedvault as a transport.
01:06:03 <dazinism> Yours isn't, but when you issued the set command it looks like it was already set.
01:08:42 <dazinism> * Yours isn't, but when you issued the command to select the transport its saying it was already selected
01:09:38 <dazinism> Guess best to open an issue on seedvaults github.
01:13:22 <RoyValentine[m]> And not GrapheneOS? How much of the details here are applicable for a SeedVault github issue?
01:18:18 <dazinism> RoyValentine: I could be wrong, but looks more like a seedvault issue, than GrapheneOS.
01:18:49 <dazinism> I'd include the logs from before we did the adb commands
01:27:34 <RoyValentine[m]> Alright. I know it is probably not great from a testing standpoint but at what point is it wrong for me to just backup and reflash my phone with the latest release and start over?
01:27:34 <RoyValentine[m]> More from a typical cleaning house thing I personally do for computers as well.
01:27:48 <RoyValentine[m]> Wait like a month of the ticket being open? Haha

01:41:25 <rny> RoyValentine[m]: thx
01:41:44 <rny> 🎉
03:12:06 <strcat> they were spamming me via PMs on IRC
03:12:11 <strcat> while I took a nap
03:12:19 <rny>  /mode +R
03:12:51 <rny> its a markov bot uni assignment gone wrong
03:15:53 <strcat[m]> time for the reddit posts I promised
03:15:57 <take_a_deep_brea> nice
03:16:02 <take_a_deep_brea> lmao
03:16:16 <rny> but its not them though, my other user that does not lurk this channel got spammed too
03:19:31 <zzxx123> strcat You should make a central place to index all the evidences about CH attacks. Chat is extremely difficult for people to gather info, and for you to inform people. A dedicated site or github page is much easier for your users to reference or link to  when discussing with non-users, and people can also help you organize evidences through a
03:19:31 <zzxx123> github page.

04:27:48 <southwest[m]> brenneke might be this:
04:27:49 <southwest[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/435
04:37:21 <brenneke[m]> K thanks but main problem is not getting keyboard when switching from owner to user profile.
04:38:33 <southwest[m]> Have you tried waiting until the race condition is over? For me something like 25 seconds.
04:39:02 <brenneke[m]> Race condition?
04:39:43 <DFuchsiaOS_when> <brenneke[m] "K thanks but main problem is not"> Odd, only encountered the delay of keyboard pop up when ending session
04:40:25 <DFuchsiaOS_when> Same to issue tracker
04:40:27 <southwest[m]> Better explained in the issue tracker than be me. Something like the ending of one session and the beginning of another collide.
04:45:24 <brenneke[m]> Just switched and let sit for about a minute, no keyboard, screen touches do not bring it up......the only way is to go into power button menu then back out, keyboard then pops up every time without fail.
04:46:04 <southwest[m]> K not sure then. Others may have input.
04:48:29 <brenneke[m]> When you switch user then hit Done you get keyboard just like that?
04:50:53 <southwest[m]> Yes. However when I go from user to owner I occasionally get the race condition. The home screen pops under for a moment, then I can put in pin after about 25 seconds.
05:09:58 <southwest[m]> Have to head out - one thing to check, under On-screen Keyboard its GrapheneOS keyboard.
05:43:19 <June77> Can you root on graphene os ?
05:43:39 <take_a_deep_brea> No .
05:44:22 <take_a_deep_brea> Graphene OS has verified boot , so any modifications to the file system root are either rolled back on an update/reboot or the OS wont boot at all.
05:44:27 <June77> does anybody know how to disable the proximity sensor?
05:44:45 <take_a_deep_brea> You can toggle the sensors permission
05:45:11 <June77> is that the one under developer options?
05:45:20 <take_a_deep_brea> which should deny sensors access to app and so the app should not be able to process or transmit any sensor data
05:45:32 <take_a_deep_brea> or even communicate with sensors
05:45:48 <take_a_deep_brea> June77: There is a per app sensors permission
05:45:58 <take_a_deep_brea> please use that
05:46:41 <June77> ok
05:46:59 <take_a_deep_brea> do not enable developer options as they are intended for app/system developers to test various OS conditions and how the app or OS service they are working on behaves in such conditions
05:48:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where's sedbot?
05:48:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need him rq
05:48:16 <June77> does it affect the overall privacy?
05:48:24 <take_a_deep_brea> what?
05:48:27 <take_a_deep_brea> dev options?
05:48:30 <June77> yeah
05:48:51 <take_a_deep_brea> well , as i said they are for developers testing stuff
05:48:58 <take_a_deep_brea> not for daily usage
05:49:08 <June77> I see
05:49:09 <somenerd[m]> it'll probably increase attack surface
05:49:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> The disable sensors toggle in developer options is not a security or privacy feature
05:49:20 <somenerd[m]> no real privacy benefit afaik
05:49:26 <somenerd[m]> (or detriment)
05:49:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please use the user facing toggle only
05:50:29 <take_a_deep_brea> so yes you may end up doing something you have no idea about and that is not a good position to be in , unless you are a developer
05:52:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even if you're a developer
05:52:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't assume we know everything
05:54:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> people without a good idea of what they are doing will have no hesitation to do something even developers would hesitate to do
05:57:29 <June77> so if you turn off dev options will it reset everything to the default ?
05:57:34 <take_a_deep_brea> that is true for a lot of things , not just software usage
05:58:02 <take_a_deep_brea> June77: some get reset , some are not i am not sure which

07:01:18 <somenerd[m]> this is definetely off topic and not relevant to GrapheneOS
07:01:49 <nonie689[m]> cause many people ask this in the faq
07:02:04 <somenerd[m]> you mean that it's on the website?
07:02:15 <somenerd[m]> yeah but it's still not relevant to GrapheneOS

07:03:40 <take_a_deep_brea>  nullnode: no

07:04:01 <nonie689[m]> Faked google play service then?
07:04:18 <nullnode[m]> Still not relevant.
07:04:26 <take_a_deep_brea> why not just stop calling it names and let it be
07:04:33 <nullnode[m]> Why even have a dependency?
07:04:34 <take_a_deep_brea> this room is not for shitting on google
07:04:49 <nonie689[m]> I need it for the vim pay app and the satilite. App (free call)

07:06:31 <somenerd[m]> he's also talking about the attacks a while ago
07:06:34 <nonie689[m]> For*
07:06:46 <somenerd[m]> when the trolls decided to be active for 12 hours
07:06:54 <strcat[m]> nscnt: it's very obvious what was happening
07:06:55 <somenerd[m]> and kept coming
07:07:03 <nullnode[m]> Writing to the app developer is the beat option nonie689
07:07:03 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they spammed the channel for over 12 hours
07:07:06 <jeff[m]5> Are there any moderation features that folks here think matrix should add?  I suppose this is actually an IRC gateway, so one would instead use moderation bots on IRC?
07:07:11 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they kept posting Copperhead talking points
07:07:18 <nonie689[m]> do somebody know an alternative app?
07:07:22 <strcat[m]> nscnt: if people can't see that it's them, well, I don't know what to say
07:07:40 <nullnode[m]> <nonie689[m] "do somebody know an alternative "> There are many for VoIP
07:07:42 <strcat[m]> nscnt: and this happens directly in response to us making 5 posts about Copperhead's bad behavior
07:07:46 <somenerd[m]> <nonie689[m] "do somebody know an alternative "> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
07:07:50 <take_a_deep_brea> nscnt:  i downvoted it and intend to make a reply there.
07:07:52 <nonie689[m]> I want a free one
07:08:03 <strcat[m]> nscnt: using sockpuppets does not excuse them from what they're doing
07:08:08 <strcat[m]> that is classic James tactics
07:08:16 <nonie689[m]> What voip app do you know for international call
07:08:23 <somenerd[m]> it's offtopic
07:08:24 <jeff[m]5> If there is any moderation features on the matrix side, then the matrix people are usually pretty supportive, not fast but quite supportive, and some of the rest of us use matrix for work so we can have people place bounties on amtrix features and such.
07:08:26 <nullnode[m]> <nonie689[m] "I want a free one"> Now the apps are usually free but service needs to be paid usually I believe for calling traditional phone numbers.
07:08:30 <nonie689[m]> somenerd: Sorry
07:08:32 <strcat[m]> nscnt: I can post logs from their channel where they coordinate raids and harassment too
07:08:40 <somenerd[m]> it's been offtopic from the start
07:08:48 <strcat[m]> nscnt: anyway I'm going to be making 5 posts on Reddit a day with evidence
07:08:55 <strcat[m]> until they completely drop their attacks against us
07:08:58 <nonie689[m]> I will ask know in offtopic channel
07:09:05 <strcat[m]> on a day where they are not obsessively attacking us, I won't need to post
07:09:23 <nullnode[m]> James is mad about the garbage video
07:10:04 <nonie689[m]> Now*
07:10:07 <nullnode[m]> Breaking his piggy bank on the social fodder campaign to compensate.
07:12:10 <strcat[m]> nscnt: I have proof of them coordinating it
07:12:28 <strcat[m]> nscnt: I am posting things 1 by 1 in separate Reddit posts and you can look at the overall posts instead of 1 by 1
07:12:51 <somenerd[m]> yeah, he'll probably post the 12 hour raid as well
07:13:01 <strcat[m]> I'm also going to start posting chat logs with James from before the split with Copperhead
07:13:05 <strcat[m]> among other things
07:13:41 <jeff[m]5> I'm sure you know this but https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation begins by explaining how to remove all recent messages by some user.
07:13:44 <strcat[m]> have had enough of their attacks on the project and it isn't going to be tolerated any longer
07:13:50 <strcat[m]> I know how to do that
07:14:07 <strcat[m]> it doesn't help much when they put obscene stuff in their names/avatars and it doesn't address them repeatedly making new accounts
07:14:18 <strcat[m]> removing all messages also causes massive lag
07:14:29 <strcat[m]> and then I can't do anything for 2 minutes while it goes
07:14:39 <jeff[m]5> <strcat[m] "removing all messages also cause"> this should probably be reported as a bug
07:14:50 <strcat[m]> more concerned with other things
07:15:04 <strcat[m]> like Matrix kicking people who don't post to the channel for 30 days
07:15:43 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
07:16:04 <strcat[m]> I think I'll also make a post showing their totally desperate attempt at sweet talking @jack
07:16:10 <strcat[m]> among other things
07:16:25 <strcat[m]> here's the thing
07:16:29 <strcat[m]> there is so much that I could post
07:16:31 <strcat[m]> I will not run out
07:16:53 <strcat[m]> and the stuff that hits hard I will keep talking about
07:16:58 <strcat[m]> some stuff only needs to be mentioned once
07:17:18 <strcat[m]> don't plan on making multiple posts about a given raid on our channel
07:17:27 <strcat[m]> but when they raid our channel they can expect 1 post on both subreddits in response
07:17:34 <strcat[m]> that is how things are going to work from now on
07:17:53 <strcat[m]> every attack by them against us, we respond by talking about and showing what they are doing
07:18:08 <strcat[m]> I said in the post title that people should judge what happened there for themselves
07:18:30 <strcat[m]> what I didn't bother explaining is that this happens while they are active on Telegram, and as part of an escalation by them publicly
07:18:42 <strcat[m]> which I can show based on lining up the timestamps on Telegram, Twitter and with stuff like this
07:18:57 <strcat[m]> which demonstrates that they go through a phase of rapidly attacking us across multiple platforms in a coordinated way
07:19:13 <strcat[m]> it is not an isolated incident
07:19:17 <strcat[m]> it is 1 part of their overall attacks
07:20:28 <strcat[m]> do not expect me to prove every little minor thing like by evidence against a specific sockpuppet in extreme detail rather than focusing on the important things
07:20:44 <strcat[m]> and btw I have a script for fingerprinting their Matrix accounts so I know which ones are tied together
07:20:52 <take_a_deep_brea> lmfao
07:21:00 <strcat[m]> that is how I knew that was a concern troll and led them into a trap
07:21:05 <strcat[m]> instead of taking it seriously
07:21:11 <take_a_deep_brea> that's ingenious
07:21:17 <somenerd[m]> > and btw I have a script for fingerprinting their Matrix accounts so I know which ones are tied together
07:21:17 <somenerd[m]> wow that's cool
07:21:49 <strcat[m]> it's not really as clever as it seems
07:21:49 <strcat[m]> they are really dumb
07:22:14 <somenerd[m]> also most people talking about "vulnerabilities" turn out to be trolling
07:22:19 <somenerd[m]> especially here
07:22:26 <strcat[m]> anyway you can see when James becomes active, along with others like Max
07:22:36 <strcat[m]> and you can correlate activity across platforms
07:23:15 <strcat[m]> it is a given that when there are 12 hours of raids on our channel
07:23:19 <strcat[m]> we are going to have a response to it
07:23:26 <strcat[m]> they wasted substantial moderator time and developer time
07:23:39 <strcat[m]> and what people in this channel can do to prevent that happening again
07:23:44 <strcat[m]> is to promote both of those posts on Reddit
07:23:51 <strcat[m]> so that Copperhead decides that this is a bad idea and stops doing it
07:24:08 <strcat[m]> just upvote both posts
07:24:14 <strcat[m]> don't cross-post them, they aren't interesting enough for that
07:24:17 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/lr5s3p/log_of_someone_who_spent_hours_raiding_the/
07:24:21 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/lr6b9w/log_from_near_end_of_12_hours_of_copperhead/
07:24:22 <nscnt[m]> How do Copperhead's attacks affect others? Are ordinary users more likely to be carried to Copperhead and against GrapheneOS? It feels more like it's just people hanging out with Copperhead who want it badly enough and less because they're being deceived.
07:24:53 <somenerd[m]> since you're aware of the manipulation, you're more resistant
07:25:00 <take_a_deep_brea> true
07:25:09 <somenerd[m]> to the outside viewer though, they may not be as resistant
07:25:23 <somenerd[m]> ex: people in non-privsec communities
07:25:44 <take_a_deep_brea> nscnt:  the room has now become a place where we are holding this discussion about this , that should be enough damage in my opinion
07:25:57 <somenerd[m]> yeah that in and of itself is damage
07:26:12 <nscnt[m]> I'm just afraid of the low effectiveness-energy-ratio
07:26:15 <somenerd[m]> and continuing it isn't a good idea
07:26:15 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they spent 12 hours raiding this channel yesterday
07:26:24 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they took substantial time from developers/moderators
07:26:26 <somenerd[m]> they ruined every convo that happened then
07:26:27 <strcat[m]> they shut down discussion here
07:26:31 <strcat[m]> they stopped new people getting help
07:26:44 <strcat[m]> nscnt: and yes they DO trick people with their misinformation especially when pretending to be GrapheneOS users
07:26:49 <strcat[m]> nscnt: you have probably been tricked by them
07:26:57 <strcat[m]> nscnt: when I'm not here people fall for their concern trolling BS
07:27:01 <somenerd[m]> they're good at manipulation
07:27:03 <nscnt[m]> No, I just don't care about them ^^
07:27:07 <somenerd[m]> like good
07:27:11 <somenerd[m]> <nscnt[m] "No, I just don't care about them"> you can't tell
07:27:14 <strcat[m]> nscnt: yet I can probably find a log where you fell for their BS
07:27:22 <somenerd[m]> they pretend like they're a good person
07:27:25 <nscnt[m]> mh ok
07:27:26 <somenerd[m]> and in good faith
07:27:27 <strcat[m]> they join the channel
07:27:31 <strcat[m]> pretend to be some concerned person
07:27:34 <somenerd[m]> it's easy to fall for it
07:27:34 <strcat[m]> derail discussion
07:27:45 <strcat[m]> and then often they do something making it clear it's the same few people
07:27:50 <somenerd[m]> unless you're quite cynical
07:28:07 <somenerd[m]> > and then often they do something making it clear it's the same few people
07:28:07 <somenerd[m]> yeah....
07:28:13 <strcat[m]> nscnt: and now we have to be really strict to avoid the channel being derailed and used to spread FUD
07:28:22 <strcat[m]> nscnt: that is because of them, not us
07:28:28 <somenerd[m]> they come here and say that there's a vulnerability (even though it's unsubstantiated)
07:28:38 <strcat[m]> nscnt: so even just from this IRC/Matrix nonsense within our channels
07:28:43 <strcat[m]> I don't see how you can claim it has little impact
07:28:56 <strcat[m]> nscnt: and that is hardly one of the major issues, you're misrepresenting this as if it is one of the main things being talked about
07:29:05 <strcat[m]> nscnt: this is one of dozens of ways they find to cause harm to us
07:29:09 <strcat[m]> it is not one of the major ways, sure
07:29:11 <strcat[m]> it still has an impact
07:29:16 <strcat[m]> and as I said, it is going to have a response
07:29:24 <strcat[m]> no matter how much less serious it is than their other attacks
07:29:54 <nullnode[m]> So does James spammers get paid per post?
07:30:02 <strcat[m]> nscnt: leaving it without a response leads to them continuing
07:30:09 <nullnode[m]> If we isolate them and have people talk to them can we drain him funds?
07:30:19 <strcat[m]> nscnt: I think you will see that I have successfully stopped their spamming for the time being
07:30:28 <strcat[m]> nscnt: James will tell them to stop, and it will stop
07:30:50 <strcat[m]> nscnt: if you don't want it to stop then sure your plan of having me spend 12 hours a day dealing with it
07:30:53 <strcat[m]> and being totally quiet about what is being done
07:30:54 <strcat[m]> is fine
07:31:07 <strcat[m]> not happening sorry
07:31:20 <strcat[m]> if they waste even 10 minutes of my time with their BS
07:31:23 <strcat[m]> it is worthy of a post on Reddit
07:31:35 <nscnt[m]> <strcat[m] "and being totally quiet about wh"> No, not at all. That's why I was referring to the effectiveness-energy-ratio.
07:31:50 <strcat[m]> nscnt: did you not see them raiding the channel for 12 hrs yesterday?
07:31:57 <somenerd[m]> I think he was talking about why copperhead is doing this
07:32:02 <somenerd[m]> but yeah, it wastes time
07:32:05 <somenerd[m]> a LOT of time
07:32:16 <strcat[m]> nscnt: they want to waste my time and energy but they will stop doing it if it causes tons of harm to them
07:32:18 <somenerd[m]> and this conversation is basically proof of that
07:32:27 <strcat[m]> yes
07:32:32 <strcat[m]> this is more of my time and energy used
07:32:39 <strcat[m]> dealing with people giving unwanted and uninformed advice on how to counter them
07:32:46 <strcat[m]> rather than actually helping to counter what they are doing
07:32:53 <somenerd[m]> talking about it here is not effective
07:33:05 <strcat[m]> I want help
07:33:06 <strcat[m]> not advice
07:33:09 <nullnode[m]> Yes it is
07:33:13 <strcat[m]> giving me advice helps Copperhead, not me
07:33:16 <strcat[m]> you are just using my time
07:33:21 <strcat[m]> you could be helping to counter what they are doing
07:33:24 <nullnode[m]> <somenerd[m] "talking about it here is not eff"> Having public records is the most important
07:33:25 <somenerd[m]> don't talk about it here
07:33:28 <nullnode[m]> Identifying and documenting
07:33:30 <somenerd[m]> <nullnode[m] "Having public records is the mos"> yes
07:33:41 <somenerd[m]> but this isn't the correct place
07:34:09 <somenerd[m]> talking about it here doesn't spread the news
07:34:28 <somenerd[m]> since everyone who's read strcat's messages already know what's happening
07:34:40 <somenerd[m]> or anyone who came here for the last few days
07:34:51 <somenerd[m]> this isn't a productive conversation
07:35:26 <somenerd[m]> they manipulate people by acting neutral and in good faith
07:35:38 <somenerd[m]> I can see why people fall for their lies
07:35:54 <somenerd[m]> this spam is to waste our time
07:36:05 <somenerd[m]> nothing much more
07:36:11 <nullnode[m]> This sounds like fed talk from somenerd.
07:36:16 <nullnode[m]> Suppression of the issues.
07:36:23 <somenerd[m]> > This sounds like fed talk from somenerd.
07:36:24 <somenerd[m]> lol
07:36:39 <somenerd[m]> > Suppression of the issues.
07:36:39 <somenerd[m]> yeah I should stop as well
07:36:55 <somenerd[m]> and move on to something actually on topic
07:37:04 <nullnode[m]> Addressing the happenings is on topic as can be.
07:37:27 <nullnode[m]> Until a new or existing user needs help.
07:37:43 <somenerd[m]> preferably not this channel
07:37:51 <somenerd[m]> it's still wasting time of des
07:37:54 <nscnt[m]> Would you like a friend to waste his money/time/whatever doing stupid shit in general? I appreciate Daniel and just wanted to let (whoever) know what my thoughts on it are, especially because they probably aren't exclusive to me. That's why I was mentioning it. Even though I don't fully agree, I accept it. I don't know why we should stop mentioning it. You will always try to talk to your friend if he's about to do
07:37:54 <nscnt[m]> something that you think bad or just not worth it.
07:37:55 <somenerd[m]>  * it's still wasting time of devs
07:38:35 <somenerd[m]> I'm not saying that you're harming the project
07:38:41 <somenerd[m]> if we continue
07:38:44 <nullnode[m]> Why are you all telling someone else what to do?
07:38:47 <somenerd[m]> they've succeeded
07:38:54 <nullnode[m]> HE'S ASKING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO STUFF
07:38:54 <somenerd[m]> I'll stop
07:38:57 <nullnode[m]> NOT TELL HIM WHAT TO DO
07:39:03 <somenerd[m]> people stop
07:39:04 <nullnode[m]> Just saying.
07:39:05 <somenerd[m]> stop
07:39:06 <strcat[m]> those are my first 2 posts
07:39:09 <strcat[m]> I am making more
07:39:50 <take_a_deep_brea> nullnode:  the happenings need to be addressed in the room when its happening here lol. its happening right now elsewhere . as strcat said , it does not help him if we as semi-strangers brainstorm the situation and neglect his call for help , him being an actual part of the problem at hand and has a lot more information to go on .
07:40:15 <somenerd[m]> also, they're trying to waste our time
07:40:18 <somenerd[m]> that was the point
07:40:30 <somenerd[m]> continuing this means that they've achieved what they wanted to do
07:40:36 <nullnode[m]> Him being an actual part of the problem? Go fuck yourself.
07:40:44 <take_a_deep_brea> what ?
07:40:51 <somenerd[m]> he didn't mean it like that
07:41:03 <take_a_deep_brea> i meant he is one directly affected by the problem
07:41:04 <somenerd[m]> he meant that he has more experience with the problem
07:41:14 <somenerd[m]> than basically everyone else
07:41:15 <nullnode[m]> Ya I'm fried for now
07:41:21 <take_a_deep_brea> and i did not mean to imply anything about you
07:41:33 <somenerd[m]> he didn't imply anything
07:41:43 <somenerd[m]> again, unproductive convo
07:42:28 <somenerd[m]> it'll lead to misunderstandings at some point
07:42:38 <somenerd[m]> and not really help
07:42:39 <take_a_deep_brea> <nullnode[m] "Him being an actual part of the "> ( sorry , i cant stop lol)  i dont bend that way
08:02:20 <strcat[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/lr730c/copperhead_maliciously_registered_the/
08:10:59 <strcat[m]> and if the community doesn't want me spending my time on this you're all welcome to help
08:11:07 <strcat[m]> looking for actual help not advice
08:11:23 <strcat[m]> I need this whole nonsense to be over ASAP
08:11:30 <strcat[m]> so do your part and help make that happen
08:11:32 <somenerd[m]> Ok
08:11:47 <strcat[m]> 3/5 posts done now
08:11:50 <strcat[m]> going to do 2 more
08:11:58 <strcat[m]> and then it's done until they make another series of attacks on us
08:12:05 <strcat[m]> that is how this is going to work

08:49:17 <strcat[m]> take_a_deep_breath|mare: part of why web installer is better
08:49:25 <strcat[m]> anyway they have to actually stay in the channel if they expect a response
08:49:36 <take_a_deep_brea> yeah
08:49:51 <sphinx[m]> <strcat[m] "anyway they have to actually sta"> the bot kicked them
08:50:15 <take_a_deep_brea> oh , well thats sad
08:51:43 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, sometimes people join and don’t wait
08:53:16 <hulahooop> need help
08:53:22 <sphinx[m]> <Sigyn "** Warning: if there is any bot "> this one I think
08:53:23 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
08:54:48 <hulahooop> why do i get kicked here all the time when i post messages from the installation process?
08:55:40 <strcat[m]> you don't

08:56:50 <strcat> hulahooop: freenode kicked you for spam 2x
08:56:54 <hulahooop> yea
08:56:59 <strcat> you can't post tons of messages on irc
08:57:04 <strcat> you have to use a pastebin site
08:57:16 <strcat> Matrix allows people to do it and makes a pastebin link for irc
08:57:21 <hulahooop> dude i just want to install graphene
08:57:28 <strcat> hulahooop: no one is kicking you
08:57:33 <strcat> the server kicked you automatically
08:57:57 <strcat> hulahooop: it doesn't sound like anything went wrong, you just need to lock
08:58:02 <strcat> hulahooop: fastboot flashing lock
08:58:13 <strcat> accept locking, verify is says locked on the status screen
08:58:16 <strcat> hulahooop: then start it up
08:58:18 <strcat> should be fine
08:58:35 <strcat> hulahooop: the CLI flashing has verbose output by default
08:58:57 <hulahooop> i am now in the grapheneOS, but had these messages mentioned. apparently it did not affect the system.
08:59:06 <strcat> hulahooop: did you lock?
08:59:09 <hulahooop> yea
08:59:17 <hulahooop> and lock in developer setting
08:59:19 <strcat> hulahooop: you can verify the installation with Auditor if you want to be extra sure it's fully valid
08:59:20 <take_a_deep_brea> then you are done
08:59:25 <hulahooop> wow
08:59:28 <strcat> hulahooop: but it's already passing verified boot
08:59:33 <hulahooop> (y)
09:01:37 <hulahooop> strcat, the verification process ran cleanly during the installation, is that still necessary now?
09:02:49 <strcat[m]> hulahooop: it's not necessary but it's useful to set up Auditor
09:03:07 <strcat[m]> either local verification or remote (or both)
09:15:26 <came2complain[m]> Hi there, I just tried to install an app on my pixel3a with the latest version of the OS - I received a message saying: You don't have applications that can handle the file type 'application/vnd.android.package-archive', please install one to continue.
09:15:42 <came2complain[m]> I was able to install that apk on another device running android 10 without issues.
09:16:24 <take_a_deep_brea>  came2complain:  which app ? mind telling us the website?
09:17:15 <came2complain[m]> briar-debug.apk - a modified version of briar
09:17:26 <came2complain[m]> in development
09:21:26 <came2complain[m]> probably because it is not signed
09:21:40 <take_a_deep_brea> maybe
09:21:50 <came2complain[m]> let me check and give feedback
09:22:33 <take_a_deep_brea> came2complain:  check this out https://medium.com/codespace69/how-to-install-an-android-app-without-the-google-play-store-using-apk-5497a32c78a0
09:23:35 <take_a_deep_brea> i am not sure how relevant this is but i searched for "application/vnd.android.package-archive" over net and got this article as one of the results
09:24:57 <came2complain[m]> ok
09:25:02 <came2complain[m]> other apk's work just fine
09:25:08 <came2complain[m]> I'm sure it's because it wasn't signed
09:25:40 <take_a_deep_brea> aah yes , that maybe the case
09:30:47 <octeep[m]> Hello, are there unofficial efforts into porting GrapheneOS onto Pocophone F1? I'm planning to do so but I'd like to know if anyone has attempted it before.
09:31:25 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont think anyone has attempted that .
09:32:04 <octeep[m]> Alright then. Thanks!
09:32:48 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem .
09:38:38 <came2complain[m]> very strange issue - wasn't because it was not signed
09:39:29 <came2complain[m]> I had to use th efile explorer but even there I couldn't go via the shortcut "Downloads" or "recent" I had to choose the device first and then the Download folder
09:39:34 <came2complain[m]> only from there I could open it
09:49:34 <rishabhksingh[m]> Is it okay if I flash graphene on a phone that ALREADY has graphene on it? Or do I have to flash the stock ROM first? Thank you in advance ^^
09:50:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> rishabhksingh: there is no need to do so
09:51:13 <rishabhksingh[m]> So a factory reset would suffice?
09:52:48 <take_a_deep_brea> yes
09:55:01 <rishabhksingh[m]> Alright, thank you ^^
09:55:19 <take_a_deep_brea> no problem .
10:04:25 <donkykong[m]> Hi was there an update today?
10:07:30 <nscnt[m]> donkykong: There was no release today, no, but maybe the update was just applied after a reboot for you. Do you have a following question regarding something?

10:17:13 <nscnt[m]> donkykong: It automatically checks for updates, yes. Maybe it couldn't check for updates for a while and you just got it now.

13:38:18 <dazinism> Think it did for me, although it was six months ago
13:38:24 <tedlancer> where do i go to ask question about grapheneos
13:38:34 <dazinism> Here
13:38:41 <tedlancer> oh ok lol thank u
13:38:52 <tedlancer> i was able to install grapheneos just fine
13:39:31 <dazinism> . ..It was six months ago and a quick test.
13:40:02 <tedlancer> my question - is there a way to toggle sound vibrate mute from notification instead of using volume button - i have a hard case that makes it very hard on pixel 4
13:42:37 <dazinism> tedlancer: can add a shortcut to the homescreen
13:43:32 <dazinism> Longpress on homescreen > widget > settings (drag it onto screen) > sound
13:45:14 <tedlancer> ok gotcha
13:45:25 <tedlancer> i have two more short question
13:46:36 <tedlancer> is there a way to lock the phone w tap anywhere on homescreen - again trying to not use power button
13:46:36 <tedlancer> i cant get audio instructions on my osmand - it says text to speech engine is disabled or something like that
13:47:03 <tedlancer> i cant seem to find out where i can fix text to speech - i have looked at accessibility options
13:47:47 <dazinism> Need to add a TTS engine app
13:47:48 <dazinism> Theres rhvoice on fdroid
13:48:16 <dazinism> Install then go into android settings and enable that as your TTS engine
13:48:18 <dazinism> Oh yeah, have to download a voice in rhvoice
13:49:10 <tedlancer[m]> sorry i m still here
13:49:19 <tedlancer[m]> i m using a different thing
13:50:01 <tedlancer[m]> <dazinism "Theres rhvoice on fdroid"> ok let me try that
13:56:42 <dazinism> tedlancer: theres a way to lock also
14:01:06 <tedlancer[m]> <dazinism "tedlancer: theres a way to lock "> what is that
14:03:04 <tedlancer[m]> i want to see if i can double tap somewhere in homescreen to lock it - dont want to use buttons since my case is heavy (i have to have that bcos i break phones easily)
14:10:24 <tedlancer[m]> <dazinism "Install then go into android set"> how do i do this? i downloaded the voice from rhvoice - i m trying but cant seem to figure it out
14:11:52 <dazinism> tedlancer: in the main android settings > accessibility
14:12:13 <dazinism> For power off you can use
14:12:19 <dazinism> https://github.com/butzist/ActivityLauncher
14:12:39 <dazinism> Search for screen saver
14:13:40 <tedlancer[m]> <dazinism "For power off you can use "> just want to lock it without power button not power off the phone
14:13:47 <dazinism> Long press that and drag it onto the home screen
14:14:09 <dazinism> Yeah sorry, thats what I mean
14:14:53 <dazinism> That gives you a homescreen icon that allows you to start the screen saver
14:15:09 <dazinism> By default the device locks 5 seconds later
14:16:27 <dazinism> Can change that in settings > security > screen lock (tap the cog)
14:21:52 <dazinism> What kind of monster case do you have???
14:24:29 <UserNickolas> Hello, I was in the process of installing Grapheneos via WebUSB and encountered an error while flashing the factory images. Is this the right forum for asking advice?
14:25:18 <dazinism> Yes
14:26:26 <UserNickolas> Great thanks. I got the error message "Error: The requested file could not be read, typically due to permission problems that have occurred after a reference to a file was acquired."
14:27:01 <strcat> UserNickolas: make sure not to use Incognito mode
14:27:03 <strcat> if you're doing that
14:27:08 <strcat> it doesn't allow it to have enough storage space
14:27:39 <strcat> UserNickolas: Incognito uses in-memory storage based on a % of system memory and it isn't enough unless you have 128GB of memory or something like that
14:28:10 <UserNickolas> It's not in incognito
14:28:32 <UserNickolas> in chrome
14:29:04 <strcat[m]> UserNickolas: which OS
14:29:21 <UserNickolas> windows 10
14:31:16 <UserNickolas> I checked everything should be up to date
14:31:19 <strcat[m]> UserNickolas: recommend closing browser, opening again
14:31:30 <strcat[m]> close unnecessary pages
14:31:37 <strcat[m]> probably a memory or storage space issue
14:32:04 <strcat[m]> run the download again and try again
14:32:15 <strcat[m]> clear some storage space if you can
14:32:50 <UserNickolas> ok, will the installation process start all over again pick up from where I left it?
14:33:21 <UserNickolas> And what should I do with in the phone that's in fastbootd?
14:34:29 <UserNickolas> *correction: ok, will the installation process start all over again OR pick up from where I left it?
14:34:31 <tedlancer[m]> <dazinism "Install then go into android set"> im still not able to figure this out - osmand still says tts engine not working
14:36:46 <strcat> UserNickolas: put it back to bootloader interface
14:36:56 <strcat> UserNickolas: the web install process is smart enough to do it though
14:37:06 <strcat> UserNickolas: just start over with download + flashing
14:37:09 <strcat> it's smart enough to cope
14:37:12 <strcat> it has to start over
14:37:26 <strcat> UserNickolas: in all likelihood the page ran out of storage space
14:37:41 <strcat> UserNickolas: don't know why but recommend closing as much stuff as you can (in browser and outside), freeing storage space, etc.
14:40:37 <UserNickolas> Ok thanks, I'll try that 
14:40:37 <UserNickolas> 👍
14:40:56 <UserNickolas> guess i have to close this chat as well in the process
15:37:20 <waterisblue7[m]> hey guys i have a quesiton - i have installed grapheneos but not sure how i can install nordvpn on my phone to shield from my phone carrier keeping tabs on the website i visit
15:38:21 <freestar887> apparently you can download the apk from their site: https://nordvpn.com/download/android/
15:38:35 <freestar887> however, I find them to be a very questionable service.
15:38:43 <waterisblue7[m]> but what about all the trackers?
15:39:01 <waterisblue7[m]> <freestar887 "however, I find them to be a ver"> what do u use instead?
15:40:17 <freestar887> waterisblue7[m] Please see the section on web browsing. https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
15:41:51 <waterisblue7[m]> <freestar887 "waterisblue7 Please see the sect"> yes i have gone thru that
15:41:58 <waterisblue7[m]> i have bromite installed on my phone
15:42:29 <waterisblue7[m]> but when i m using my carrier data, i want to stay anonymous
15:42:47 <waterisblue7[m]> there are other things besides browser that can leak data, no?
15:44:27 <strcat[m]> waterisblue7: just stop with the privacy theater stuff
15:44:29 <strcat[m]> focus on real privacy
15:44:32 <freestar887> well, just by using carrier data you're actually leaking your location.
15:44:36 <strcat[m]> read the information available on our site and other good sources
15:45:34 <strcat[m]> waterisblue7: enumerating badness is not a viable approach to achieving privacy or security and not how serious approaches address it
15:46:14 <strcat[m]> also no particular reason you have to use an app from a VPN provider to use a VPN but if you don't trust their app why are you sending all your traffic through them anyway?
15:46:32 <strcat[m]> not very logical
15:55:30 <waterisblue7[m]> <freestar887 "well, just by using carrier data"> so how do i prevent that?  i still need to use gps on my phone, look up restaurants nearby, etc.
15:56:22 <strcat> waterisblue7[m]: please read through https://grapheneos.org/faq and https://grapheneos.org/usage
15:56:43 <strcat> waterisblue7[m]: also GPS has little to do with this stuff
15:56:49 <strcat> GPS does not connect to a network
15:56:51 <waterisblue7[m]> ok
15:56:54 <strcat> it doesn't transmit anything
15:57:00 <strcat> it receives location data from satelittes
15:57:19 <strcat> waterisblue7[m]: please read about the app sandbox and permission model
15:57:27 <strcat> if you have not given location access to an app, it doesn't have it
15:57:38 <stencil[m]> <waterisblue7[m] "but when i m using my carrier da"> You are routing your traffic through  a provider with unsecured servers
15:57:39 <strcat> location data is available in more ways than GPS and it's controlled by the location permission
15:57:50 <strcat> please just read the FAQ
15:57:59 <strcat> anything covered there should be information you get from there
15:58:25 <waterisblue7[m]> ok i'll read them carefully
15:58:26 <waterisblue7[m]> thank u
15:59:05 <strcat[m]> GPS is receive only and there are other ways to get location such as nearby Wi-Fi networks, nearby cell towers, nearby Bluetooth devices and so on which is all controlled by the Location toggle
15:59:28 <strcat[m]> which is a per-app permission toggle and you have to explicitly choose to grant background access rather than only foreground
15:59:45 <strcat[m]> and then there's also a global toggle where when that's not enabled, even apps with the permission cannot access it
16:00:12 <strcat[m]> plenty of control in your hands, no reason to be concerned about GPS specifically (which again is a receive only feature) rather than location data more generally
16:00:29 <strcat[m]> you need to focus on choosing which data, permissions and other access to give apps
16:00:35 <waterisblue7[m]> hmm
16:00:38 <strcat[m]> if you don't give them it, they don't have it
16:01:17 <waterisblue7[m]> yeah
16:01:41 <waterisblue7[m]> ok i ll read thru the faq n usage more carefully n try to understand
16:02:10 <waterisblue7[m]> thank u
16:23:20 <strcat[m]> btw likely going to be adding another powerful releases server to deal with the influx of new users
16:23:30 <strcat[m]> not enough bandwidth anymore
16:23:44 <strcat[m]> still deciding some details on how to set it up
16:40:40 <take_a_deep_brea> nice.
16:52:08 <thetranstocommie> i couldn't find it on the faq, and i understand the tldr answer to this question is improved security, but is there any place i can read more about the specific security concerns that would come along with bundling microg or f-droid privileged?
16:54:18 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: they're different
16:54:35 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: F-Droid privileged extension trusts a specific F-Droid release with the ability to install apps without user consent in the background
16:54:48 <strcat[m]> think it's quite obvious why that should only be given to a highly robust and trustworthy app that's not really buggy
16:54:56 <strcat[m]> and it gives a bad user experience due to F-Droid bugs and limitations anyway
16:55:12 <strcat[m]> it will happily close the app you are running and F-Droid has bugs like attempting to download/install multiple times
16:55:28 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: microG doesn't work from being bundled, it simply wouldn't work, that isn't enough
16:56:06 <thetranstocommie> <strcat[m] "it will happily close the app yo"> yeah, that makes sense actually.
16:56:06 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: it requires that the system tricks apps into thinking it is Play services and the upstream way of doing that is a highly damaging patch destroying the security model of the OS and breaking verified boot
16:56:16 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: it can be done in a more scoped way
16:56:58 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: microG is a very incomplete reimplementation of Play services without security features like certificate pinning for services or apps
16:56:59 <strcat[m]> it's insecure
16:57:12 <strcat[m]> making apps trust it as Play services opens up major security holes
16:57:31 <strcat[m]> and as should be obvious it's an implementation of those proprietary Google services
16:57:35 <strcat[m]> so the same privacy issues, and so on
16:57:54 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: it is not suited to GrapheneOS at all, their approach is highly counter to ours
16:58:02 <strcat[m]> the trans to commie pipeline: it's also never going to be robust or reliable
16:58:07 <thetranstocommie> i know its insecure. anything that looks and feels so hacky so deeply integrated into the phone seems destined to have issues. I was just wondering if anyone knew a good article where i could read about those security and privacy concerns.
16:58:09 <strcat[m]> it will always be playing catch up and perpetually being broken
16:58:21 <strcat[m]> that's just inherent to what they are doing: reimplementing proprietary services without support from them
16:58:29 <strcat[m]> they're implementing a small subset of the API
16:58:36 <strcat[m]> apps will continue using more of the API, moving to newer APIs, etc.
16:58:46 <strcat[m]> and each major release of Android it will completely break and be unavailable for months
16:58:52 <strcat[m]> so how is that supposed to ever fit into GrapheneOS?
16:59:03 <strcat[m]> we'd just end up dropping it each major release even if it wasn't unacceptable for other reasons
16:59:09 <strcat[m]> so how can users depend on that?
16:59:25 <strcat[m]> what users need is support for running without Play services from the apps which the apps are going to keep working
16:59:34 <strcat[m]> not hacks to temporarily get stuff working which is going to break 2 months later
16:59:44 <strcat[m]> how can you use a phone where the stuff you rely on keeps breaking unpredictably?
16:59:54 <strcat[m]> that is a dead end and I don't know why people want it so badly
17:00:09 <thetranstocommie> that makes perfect sense and i am definitely not arguing in favor of its inclusion. i was just curious if there was a good article or paper on the vulnerabilities is all
17:00:19 <take_a_deep_brea> i dont think so
17:00:34 <strcat[m]> I'm not really interested in making an article about stuff that's out-of-scope for inclusion in the OS for clear reasons
17:00:44 <thetranstocommie> totally fair
17:01:00 <strcat[m]> people would just take it as an attack and be spiteful towards us in return
17:01:12 <take_a_deep_brea> thats true
17:01:48 <strcat[m]> if people want stuff that's hacked together, inherently going to keep breaking over and over and involves hard-wiring proprietary services deep into the OS with special privileges and hacks... well
17:01:57 <strcat[m]> I do not think they want GrapheneOS in the first place
17:02:10 <take_a_deep_brea> the trans to commie pipeline:  I get the impression that while we talk about it frequently its not so popular and so i dont think any one has written much even listing its features
17:02:12 <borosblount> hi, can anyone help me get continue installing grapheneOS on a pixel 4a? the bootloader is unlocked, the web interface buttons don't work but I was following a youtube guide- having trouble with flash-all.bat
17:02:13 <strcat[m]> we looked into whether a subset of it could be usable and the answer is no
17:02:27 <dan-is-a-bloody-> <strcat[m] "not hacks to temporarily get stu"> can't a privileged installer (like f-droid used to be) be used for the grapheneos google api caller updates?
17:02:40 <strcat[m]> borosblount: you need to stop following third party guides and undo everything they have told you to do
17:02:59 <strcat[m]> borosblount: you can't get support here until you stop following third party guides, undo everything they had you do and forget the misguided stuff they told you to do
17:03:12 <strcat[m]> borosblount: there are 2 choices: https://grapheneos.org/install/web and https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
17:03:17 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <borosblount "hi, can anyone help me get conti"> Were you using an incognito tab for the web installer?
17:04:06 <take_a_deep_brea> borosblount:  break it up . You did not make much sense , please.
17:04:07 <strcat[m]> borosblount: recommend the web installer
17:04:09 <strcat[m]> borosblount: you need to use a supported browser
17:04:10 <strcat[m]> borosblount: lists supported browsers on the page
17:04:11 <take_a_deep_brea> you mentioned flash-all , web installer in the same sentence lol
17:04:11 <strcat[m]> borosblount: use Microsoft Edge, since you already have itr
17:04:39 <strcat[m]>  * borosblount: use Microsoft Edge, since you already have it
17:04:51 <strcat[m]> borosblount: step 1: remove / uninstall anything third party guides told you to get and reboot your computer to try to make sure that stuff isn't running in the background breaking connecting to the device
17:04:59 <borosblount> Absolutely- I was not using incognito. How can I undo what has been done? restart somewhere in this bootloader menu?
17:05:10 <borosblount> firefox not edge
17:05:17 <strcat[m]> borosblount: no I'm saying you need to undo what has been done on your computer
17:05:23 <strcat[m]> borosblount: that's not a supported browser, Firefox doesn't have WebUSB
17:05:28 <strcat[m]> use Edge
17:05:41 <borosblount> I understand, thank you
17:05:45 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web#prerequisites
17:06:02 <strcat[m]> borosblount: just delete anything you got from third party guides + uninstall anything you installed, and optionally reboot if you ran anything / installed anything from them
17:06:10 <strcat[m]> borosblount: open up the web installer in Edge and follow it there
17:06:17 <strcat[m]> borosblount: should be easy
17:06:34 <borosblount> have opened it in edge, thank you very much
17:06:35 <strcat[m]> alternative is https://grapheneos.org/install/cli but web install is easier
17:06:50 <strcat[m]> third party guides are nearly all misguided/wrong and sometimes even dangerous
17:07:05 <strcat[m]> if someone isn't familiar with CLI they should be using web install anyway
17:07:26 <strcat[m]> we're aware the third party guides make it a lot harder for people to find the right info
17:07:33 <hysaag77[m]> Pleace add always incognito mode to Vanadium...
17:07:43 <nullnode[m]> @strcat congrats on capping out the release server! The movement grows like wildfire.
17:07:44 <borosblount> i wouldn't say "familiar" with command line but have had to use it before
17:07:54 <strcat[m]> hysaag77: adding features like that atm is a low priority
17:07:57 <strcat[m]> for Vanadium
17:08:14 <strcat[m]> focus is on the OS and for Vanadium on stuff that's relevant to both browser + WebView for now
17:08:28 <strcat[m]> people are welcome to work on other things
17:08:31 <strcat[m]> and submit patches for review
17:08:43 <hysaag77[m]> Oh okey
17:18:18 <borosblount> Thank you all so much for your help. It's now installed
17:47:23 <dan-is-a-bloody-> <strcat[m] "what users need is support for r"> so r u sayin' u won't be making a tiny grapheneos google play services reimplementation to make my banking work?
17:48:47 <strcat> dan-is-a-bloody-: I've made it clear we aren't going to be including any actual Play services reimplementation because it is unworkable / not viable for a production OS
17:48:59 <strcat> dan-is-a-bloody-: you can read https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
17:49:30 <strcat> if your banking app is able to work with a stub implementation of the APIs then perhaps it could work but no guarantee they continue allowing the app to work without being able to actually use Google services
17:49:34 <strcat> dan-is-a-bloody-: info is all on our site
17:49:47 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no but that's what i mean the stub implementation
17:50:00 <dan-is-a-bloody-> cuz that's what u told me in PMs
17:50:05 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i guess im confused
17:52:29 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: suggest reading the section on the site
17:53:07 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no i get the "no actual GPS" thing
17:53:12 <dan-is-a-bloody-> i was just hoping for the stubs
17:53:37 <strcat[m]> dan-is-a-bloody-legend: there isn't going to be any actual implementation of Google services or other APIs if that isn't clear
17:53:47 <dan-is-a-bloody-> its clear
17:53:53 <strcat[m]> it does not belong baked into the OS as something specifically privileged
17:54:04 <dan-is-a-bloody-> yup
17:54:10 <dan-is-a-bloody-> just the stubs pls
17:54:15 <dan-is-a-bloody-> stubs when?
17:55:21 <waterisblue7[m]> Wouldn't downloading ur banking app from aurora store work?
17:55:21 <waterisblue7[m]> I do my banking on a browser but I'm just curious
17:56:07 <dan-is-a-bloody-> ye my banking apps just refuse to work and adb debug is showing its cuz its trying to make a google play service call and fails, so a stub wud fix it
17:56:26 <waterisblue7[m]> What's a stub
17:56:55 <dan-is-a-bloody-> its like a fake door to gps
17:57:15 <dan-is-a-bloody-> the app doesnt know the door is fake so it doesnt crash it just thinks there's no connection to gps
17:57:20 <dan-is-a-bloody-> (google play services)
17:57:27 <dan-is-a-bloody-> (not global positioning system)
17:57:28 <waterisblue7[m]> Oh OK. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having grapheneos in the first place?
17:57:38 <dan-is-a-bloody-> no it doesnt cuz its just a fake door
17:57:40 <strcat[m]> waterisblue7: not sure what you're talking about
17:57:57 <strcat[m]> waterisblue7: and again you've really got the *wrong* idea of what GrapheneOS is and need to read https://grapheneos.org/features and https://grapheneos.org/
17:58:06 <strcat[m]> you don't understand the primary purpose of the project
17:58:13 <strcat[m]>  * you don't understand the primary purposes of the project
17:58:42 <strcat[m]> waterisblue7: please read https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services in particular after reading the features page to understand what the project is about
17:59:02 <strcat[m]>  * waterisblue7: please read the features page to understand what the project is about and then read https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services which covers this well
17:59:26 <waterisblue7[m]> Oh ok

19:55:57 <bizanon[m]> is there a way to globally forward socks5 traffic? not thru vanadium or firefox
19:56:55 <strcat> bizanon[m]: sure, use a VPN service supporting it
19:57:21 <bizanon[m]> something like a proxifier for gos
19:57:25 <bizanon[m]> not a vpn socks
19:57:38 <strcat> you're misunderstanding what I'm saying
19:57:54 <strcat> the way the OS supports rerouting traffic through an app is the VPN service feature
19:58:00 <strcat> the app does not actually have to implement a 'VPN'
19:58:14 <bizanon[m]> oh okay
19:58:25 <bizanon[m]> any apps like that exist right now?
19:58:36 <strcat> yes, don't have a list tho

22:05:21 <tedlancer[m]> Hi people, I asked this question this morning re TTS. I installed RHVoice as recommended and downloaded one of the English languages.
22:05:21 <tedlancer[m]> When I go to OSMAnd n put in navigation, it still says TTS engine off or something like that. Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question...
22:05:47 <tedlancer[m]> I can't hear any navigation voice
22:18:12 <strcat[m]> you have to enable it as the TTS engine
22:18:13 <strcat[m]> not just install it
22:19:02 <tedlancer[m]> Can u please guide me how I can do that
22:19:19 <tedlancer[m]> I went into accessibility n thought I did enable it
22:27:43 <p1trson[m]> Hello folks. Before I order my new Pixel 4a 5G, jsut wanted to verify whether the OS is now fully supporting it? ( so no beta or RC only?) I did read the FAQ and seen that it's recommended device. I've seen also that the os release for this model is marked as "Stable"
22:29:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hello p1trson[m], yes, your 4a5G will be fully supported. Make sure you download the correct image for it, which is marked with the word "Bramble."
22:29:43 <TheJollyRoger> If you attempt to flash "Sunfish" to it you will permanently damage the bootloader and wreck the phone, so make sure it says "Bramble."
22:30:09 <p1trson[m]> cheers m8! going to order it just now ^^
22:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship in advance, future shipmate :)
22:34:59 <RoyValentine[m]> <nullnode[m] "Anything you can think that was "> Nothing really that I can think of. I've just been on stable OTA since last year. I do run a syncthing backup task on the folder that seedvault saves to but I don't know if that would cause any issue over time. It had been working fine until December of last year.
23:00:23 <tedlancer[m]> Can someone please tell me how I can enable TTS
23:31:39 <tedlancer[m]> i want to get the voice on the gps working in osmand
23:31:46 <tedlancer[m]> i dont know what i am doing wrong
23:31:53 <tedlancer[m]> i m sure it is a simple fix
23:32:06 <tedlancer[m]> everytime i start the navigation it says TTS engine failed
23:42:42 <nullnode[m]> I tested the TTS apps in F-droid and can't seem to get one working, getting to my workstation now to check the errors, but I'm guessing they are using older API versions
23:43:12 <strcat[m]> RHVoice works fine
23:43:21 <strcat[m]> tedlancer: did you select it as the active TTS or no
23:46:24 <nullnode[m]> @strcat:matrix.org: I get errors with RHVoice, couldn't start TTS engine
23:47:44 <strcat[m]> I have heard success stories with it though
23:47:49 <strcat[m]> suggest reinstalling it
23:48:08 <nullnode[m]> I'm using it with osmand, just downloaded them to test for tedlancer:
23:48:27 <nullnode[m]> adb logs coming soon, almost home with the dog
23:48:59 <nullnode[m]> F-Droid latest for the apps, and latest GrapheneOS build
23:51:12 <infanta[m]> Just tried RHS, works fine for me. Make sure it is selected as preferred engine in text to speech output in system settings.
