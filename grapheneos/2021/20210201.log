00:12:11 <strcat[m]> you also have to ask GitHub to GC / purge caches
00:12:15 <strcat[m]> if you pushed it to GitHub
00:12:21 <strcat[m]> it's a standard thing they can do
00:12:27 <strcat[m]> but really
00:12:34 <strcat[m]> you should rotate to a new key / password...
00:12:37 <strcat[m]> and just stop using that one
00:15:21 <m2tu[m]> strcat pls can u help
00:16:00 <m2tu[m]> i sarched all the drectorys cant find which file has packages for build
00:19:21 <m2tu[m]> i find project.list in .repo map has some but not all apps
00:20:51 <oldman_newuser> m2tu[m]  is this what you are looking for ?
00:20:52 <oldman_newuser> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_manifest/blob/64d7e879d8b1d8f35e65bc15ddf9dda25e446a54/default.xml#L351
00:21:36 <oldman_newuser> that would be the line for the pdfviewer external app
00:21:59 <m2tu[m]> hmmm.. maby this is what he meant
00:22:02 <m2tu[m]> im looking to remov some apps
00:22:25 <oldman_newuser> yea I have built from source but never added nor removed apps
00:22:35 <m2tu[m]> befor ei build... and on guy here told me i shall not delete directorys but packages from a list... but n
00:23:02 <m2tu[m]> so u think this is a list
00:23:22 <m2tu[m]> forexample if i wnanna remove pdfviewer... just delete it from list here ?
00:24:07 <oldman_newuser> yea I have built from source but never added nor removed apps.  sorry this is all I have for you.  if anything I would want to add apps but I dont need to build from source anymore
00:30:35 <m2tu[m]> ok thanks anhow for the help.  will try se what happens
00:47:20 <m2tu[m]> Im trying to setup iptables INPUT reject ALL , is thre an way doing it from build so that rule allways will be active when i flash the phone ?
00:52:55 <Guest> Quick question about GrapheneOS, I'm a bit new to it and I've installed it mainly for privacy and deGoogling, I've also installed TrackerControl on it from FDroid and I noticed that it is reporting several system components connecting to Google (specifically android.clients.google.com) is this normal and what are these connections for?
00:54:01 <strcat[m]> m2tu: look at system/netd
00:54:07 <strcat[m]> that's where the firewall stuff is implemented
00:55:29 <Guest> How do I do that?
01:10:00 <Guest> Anyone?
01:12:44 <m2tu[m]> im gong to install it now
01:13:19 <m2tu[m]> i dont think graphene have an apps that sents out
01:13:38 <m2tu[m]> try using noRoot firewall
01:15:51 <Guest> I'll have a look at noRoot, but TrackerControl is reporting 14 different system components making those requests
01:16:12 <m2tu[m]> have installed it now
01:16:18 <m2tu[m]> so far not see anthing
01:23:15 <Guest> Could it be malware somehow? I don't install apps outside of FDroid and official sources
01:24:43 <Guest> And I'm on the latest version of Grapheme
01:36:49 <super_noob[m]> Hey folks. I've run the install process via  powershell  on a pixel  3 xl. I've gotten to the point where I  have locked the boot  loader. But I'm stuck in fastboot mode. After entering fastboot  reboot, nothing happens, it  just keeps rebooting into fastboot mode.  Any suggestions on how I can get out of fastboot mode?/
01:49:37 <KE345> Dedicated VPN (like Proton VPN, for instance) app vs. tracker Firewall (nroot Firewall for instance). Which one is better option?
01:50:15 <TheJollyRoger> hey super_noob[m], are you getting the same result when you select Start?
01:50:37 <entry1[m]> <super_noob[m] "Hey folks. I've run the install "> So you locked the bootloader after flashing it where it says "press any key to exit"
01:51:21 <entry1[m]> If so, just go to the prompt where you power off the device and then when you press the power back on, it should say it is loading a different os and then load
02:17:30 <randonumbanein> Hello.  I have a vague understanding of some things and am seeking clarification.  I've read criticism of Android for it not being mainline Linux, but micay has said that Linux isn't all that great for security/privacy iirc.  So mainlining android would actually make for a bigger flaw than feature, right?  When micay says that he eventually
02:17:31 <randonumbanein> wants to move graphene past aosp and the Linux kernel, does this mean it would become a distinct OS?  Like would it continue to look and function like mobile Android, or would the UI change, or possibly become a desktop os as well?
02:19:02 <TheJollyRoger> Hello randonumbanein, it's likely that if GrapheneOS replaced the kernel of the operating system, the users probably wouldn't see any difference at the end of the day.
02:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> Something to take note of is that a majority of the Android ecosystem, and many Android apps, are written in Java. In the absence of bad programming practices, Java bytecode will generally execute in any environment that can run a Java Virtual Machine.
02:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> (Java, or Kotlin)
02:27:32 <fckmepls[m]> <louipc "what's your main os"> ubuntu desktop 20.10
02:31:54 <randonumbanein> Thanks.  The kernel is all under the hood as I understand it.  I was curious because I also read that micay wants to add Linux compatibility in the future, and I assume that he wouldn't want to break compatibility with linux or Android after graphene moves on from both.  Not unless graphene was used widely enough I think.
02:39:15 <fckmepls[m]> <bn365[m] "> <@bn365:matrix.org> i have may"> which os you're running?
02:45:40 <fckmepls[m]> <bn365[m] "hello. i am new to group, need h"> did you installed ADB and started deamon on 5037?
02:46:54 <TheJollyRoger> fckmepls[m]: we don't install ADB, we instead simply download and run the prepackaged official ADB from its location.
02:47:14 <TheJollyRoger> If you're "installing" adb on your operating system, likely you're installing a bundled version with your OS or are installing an unofficial version.
02:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> In both cases, this will either end you up more often than not with the safety check giving you a "Fastboot too old" error and halting, or a bricked device should you bypass the safety check.
02:48:28 <TheJollyRoger> *or a bootlooping or bricked device
02:49:22 <fckmepls[m]> <strcat[m] "which uses our own implementatio"> thanks!!
02:50:04 <brenneke[m]> Are screenshots possible in Vanadium?
02:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: Hang on a sec and I'll try one.
02:50:45 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: Screenshots work.
02:57:05 <KE3459> Dedicated VPN (like Proton VPN, for instance) app vs. tracker Firewall (nroot Firewall for instance). Which one is better option?
02:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hello KE3459, I think you'll find better luck asking about that at #grapheneos-offtopic, since that's separate from GrapheneOS.
03:01:19 <TheJollyRoger> KE3459: note that GrapheneOS comes with the ability to network permission to an app as a user-facing permission.
03:02:30 <TheJollyRoger> *ability to deny network access to an app, as a user-facing permission.
03:02:50 <somenerd[m]> yeah you don't requite a Firewall to deny access to apps
03:03:09 <somenerd[m]> and it's a lot more powerful than normal Firewalls
03:03:26 <somenerd[m]> since it denies access at the API level
03:03:32 <joltman[m]> I don't think screen shots work in Vanadium incognito mode
03:03:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The network permission works in concert with the android security model.
03:04:24 <TheJollyRoger> joltman[m]: looks like your correct, seems Incognito mode denies screenshots, but regular mode allows it.
03:04:29 <TheJollyRoger> *looks like you're correct
03:06:46 <brenneke[m]> Thanks.....not on my device unfortunately. I have tried giving it more permissions, still not.
03:07:44 <brenneke[m]> Ahhh.....it is Incognito mode that prevents it.
03:07:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
03:08:06 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: I think the app itself asks the operating system, "don't screenshot me, bro!" and GrapheneOS respects its flags.
03:08:09 <strcat[m]> because it turns on the 'secure' display mode disabling the OS doing stuff that would keep persistent copies of it
03:08:21 <strcat[m]> so it stops showing it in recent apps thumbnails and stops screenshots
03:08:26 <strcat[m]> there could be a toggle for it but isn't atm
03:08:29 <strcat[m]> it's a Chromium thing
03:10:43 <fckmepls[m]> <TheJollyRoger "fckmepls: we don't install ADB, "> i actually experimented with both .. but i didn't know that ADB was the problem .. this is the only way i am able to communicate and see my devices after "$ adb devices" are you able to tell me why?
03:11:58 <fckmepls[m]> > <@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org> fckmepls: we don't install ADB, we instead simply download and run the prepackaged official ADB from its location.
03:11:58 <fckmepls[m]>  * i actually experimented both .. but i didn't know that ADB was the problem .. this is the only way i am able to communicate and see my devices after "$ adb devices" are you able to tell me why?
03:12:03 <TheJollyRoger> fckmepls[m]: You won't be using adb. It doesn't hurt having it because "adb reboot bootloader" can save you having to use the annoying combo keys to reboot to the bootloader, but that's it. Fastboot will do all the work for you.
03:12:33 <strcat[m]> adb isn't used by the GrapheneOS installation process
03:12:35 <TheJollyRoger> There are a few reasons why you may experience the odd behaviour where the phone seems to work perfectly when plugged in and android is running, yet fastboot won't do anything, I'll list them off:
03:13:30 <TheJollyRoger> The first, most easily overcome one, is that your phone is not in fastboot mode when you're working with the fastboot program. If the phone's not in fastboot, fastboot will simply hang, regardless of whether or not you do everything else right.
03:14:28 <TheJollyRoger> The second one, is that fastboot is not being allowed to talk to your phone by udev policy on Linux. This is the case when you find that running the fastboot binary as root makes things work, but when you attempt it as a standard user it hangs.
03:16:17 <TheJollyRoger> The third one, on Windows, is if you've opted not to have Windows update install the fastboot driver on Windows. By default, Windows includes the fastboot driver as a part of Windows update -- you won't need to install it manually, and definitely not install shady software to get it.
03:17:30 <TheJollyRoger> Once again - do not install third-party drivers outside of Windows update, or face the risk of compromise of the host and all sorts of nasty security issues or a bricked device at your own peril.
03:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> The fourth one is the trickiest and this is what gets most people: your USB cable, or the USB slots on your computer.
03:18:48 <TheJollyRoger> To install GrapheneOS, fastboot will use a lot of features on USB that many people that use PCs will never use.
03:19:08 <TheJollyRoger> Most people only use USB devices like thumb drives and storage devices, keyboards, mice, game controllers... etc.
03:19:55 <TheJollyRoger> So many vendors don't properly implement the USB standard, and sometimes, they don't do it to all the USB ports on the motherboard.
03:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, what may surprise you is that while the OEM cables that came in your phone's original packaging might be adequate for installing GrapheneOS, they're not actually USB 3.1 compliant because they're missing one or more wires!
03:21:26 <TheJollyRoger> Usually, what indicates problem 4, is that "fastboot devices" will show your device fine.
03:21:36 <TheJollyRoger> But then the actual flashing process hangs or fails.
03:22:38 <somenerd[m]> > The fourth one is the trickiest and this is what gets most people: your USB cable, or the USB slots on your computer.
03:22:39 <somenerd[m]> I've seen this happen a lot
03:23:56 <TheJollyRoger> If this is the case, there are two options you can take: the first one is to try a different USB slot. Generally, we've found that going from USB A to C usually helps, and often because vendors are very sloppy with front ports, use the back ports of your desktop, and make sure you don't use a hub or splitter. Plug the cable in directly. I noticed you mentioned using a virtual machine a bit back
03:23:58 <TheJollyRoger> - for the love of all things holy, please don't do that. We've found USB passthrough and emulation, especially given how careless most vendors are, to be a crapshoot.
03:24:05 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: oh yeah.
03:24:27 <somenerd[m]> maybe that should be included in a troubleshooting section?
03:24:42 <TheJollyRoger> somenerd[m]: Good idea, you know what I'll go and get onto that now.
03:24:42 <somenerd[m]> like the most common problems/ways to fix them?
03:25:15 <TheJollyRoger> Sure, good thinking!
03:28:01 <TheJollyRoger> fckmepls[m]: If none of the ports on your motherboard are properly implemented and have the full featureset of the USB 3.1 standard available to them, the only advice I can give you, is to attempt the installation on another computer, then using Android Remote Attestation via Auditor to verify the integrity of the installation after you've locked the bootloader.
03:29:55 <rny> dont make my mistake and load userland fastboot before fastboot updates the bootloader
03:29:59 <rny> lol
03:30:04 <rny> it is so routine now i made a note
03:30:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ahaha!
03:30:48 <rny> i think most of the misunderstanding will go away if the fastboot cli was called something else
03:31:03 <TheJollyRoger> D'oh!
03:31:15 <rny> who'd think that you might also use the fastboot cli when you're not in userland fastboot
03:46:54 <fckmepls[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If this is the case, there are t"> yes i tried it with a virtual machine even if I know that it’s "not recommend" but without success .. for the USB cable I bought the "A to C" on google store and I have another one 3.1 I paid 40$ so I don't think that's the problem in my case?
03:48:06 <TheJollyRoger> fckmepls[m]: Might be the USB ports on your computer, or your motherboard vendor is not properly implementing the USB protocol.
03:48:48 <somenerd[m]> The reason that VMs aren't suggested is because of USB passthrough not being reliable
03:48:55 <fckmepls[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The second one, is that fastboot"> ohh shit .. really ?! I think we have something here
03:55:39 <fckmepls[m]> <somenerd[m] "The reason that VMs aren't sugge"> that's what i've effectively noticed
04:04:03 <fckmepls[m]> <rny "who'd think that you might also "> loll I'm stupid but not that much ..

16:47:23 <Ted__Lavender> I have just switched to GrapheneOS from iOS and have a question about installing Android Accessibility Tools (I like to use the screen reader).  Are these tools a security risk or were they not included with the ROM only to decrease bloat?
16:48:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ted__Lavender: there is a security risk
16:48:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> But if you must use it then go ahead
16:50:21 <Ted__Lavender> Thank You, can you provide any additional details as to the extent of the risk?
16:50:26 <m2tu[m]> have u guys seen some companys sells grapheneOS phones from 900-1500USD
16:50:47 <m2tu[m]> wonder if the really have rights to do that
16:51:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ted__Lavender: accessibility services can view and control everything on your screen
16:51:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And even provide input to other apps on your behalf
16:52:20 <Ted__Lavender> Thank You
16:56:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ted__Lavender: you see how that could get pretty bad?
16:56:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's say a malicious app gets the permission
16:57:20 <Ted__Lavender> Definitely, the screen reader can make life easier but for me it is not worth it

17:19:02 <Anna-Elise[m]> Hello, I currently am trying to install grapheneOS on a Pixel 4a with the web install. I am at the Flashing Factory images step, and the loading bar seems to be stuck à "Restarting Device...", while my phone is in bootloader menu (fastboot mode). Am I supposed to lock the bootloader at this point or should I wait for something ?

17:21:39 <Pratyush[m]> Anna-Elise if your device is flashed successfully. You can relock the bootloader if not then you should try flashing it manually
17:22:22 <Anna-Elise[m]> It seems to be flashed successfully but the website only tells me it's restarting the device
17:22:34 <Anna-Elise[m]> I can try to lock the bootloader I guess
17:22:54 <Pratyush[m]> Anna-Elise yes go with relocking the bootloader
17:23:27 <Anna-Elise[m]> Hmmm the bar changed to that :

17:24:23 <Pratyush[m]> Anna-Elise check browser console if you need more info about what happened.
17:24:23 <Pratyush[m]> Otherwise go with relocking the bootloader
17:25:18 <nscnt[m]> Anna-Elise: The "Flash release" progress bar changed to that?
17:25:24 <Anna-Elise[m]> Yes
17:25:47 <Anna-Elise[m]> Well I tried to lock and it can't find any proper OS. I guess I'll try again from the beginning
17:28:29 <Pratyush[m]> Anna-Elise  if you are not sure about is flahsed successfully reboot your phone check os, play with it for a while if everything seem okay.
17:28:29 <Pratyush[m]> Reboot to fastboot and relock the bootloader
17:28:43 <bn365[m]> i will do some work and come back

18:41:25 <DrHq> This the right place to ask about installation troubleshooting?
18:55:17 <Pratyush[m]> DrHq  yes
19:01:51 <DrHq> Awesome! Currently on the Obtaining Factory Image step with bootloader unlocked on a Pixel4A connected via usb to a macbook pro. When I click download release I am getting a failed to fetch error code, any advice for me?
19:03:54 <Pratyush[m]> If you trying to install it via Web Installer.
19:03:54 <Pratyush[m]> I will recommend you to go with normal command line installation for better understanding what's going on.
19:03:54 <Pratyush[m]> As for error it's saying Web Installer is unable to find release file
19:05:27 <Pratyush[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/cli
19:09:15 <DrHq> I will give the command line installation a try, thank you 🙏
19:11:06 <Pratyush[m]> Web based installation is great when it works but when it doesn't me or you doesn't have any idea about what went wrong.
19:11:06 <Pratyush[m]> That's why i convinced you to go with command line installation if you are familiar with command line a bit it's not that hard to install via command line.
19:13:00 <kdrag0n[m]1> <DrHq "Awesome! Currently on the Obtain"> please open the browser console (Inspect Element -> Console) and send the full error, that's odd because someone just sent a screenshot of a successfully downloaded Pixel 4a release above

20:54:22 <pallaf[m]> Is there an open source app which charges battery to a certain threshold eg max 80%?
20:54:37 <pallaf[m]> that would prolong battery life of phones in general
20:54:47 <pallaf[m]> pretty useful features if you leave phone charged over night
20:54:55 <TheJollyRoger> pallaf[m]: back in the mid 2010's that was the case.
20:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> These days, you're better off letting the battery self-manage.
20:55:24 <TheJollyRoger> *late 2000's to mid-2010's.
20:55:44 <pallaf[m]> TheJollyRoger: ok, but I think leaving it plugged it overnight won't do good for batteries
20:55:53 <pallaf[m]> don't you think>'
20:55:56 <TheJollyRoger> No.
20:56:25 <TheJollyRoger> The battery's onboard firmware will stop it from charging at a level that will prolong its lifespan, freeing up charge as it ages.
20:56:39 <TheJollyRoger> That kind of thinking is >5 years out of date.
20:57:26 <TheJollyRoger> These days, you're better off letting the battery's onboard computer manage the battery and simply plug it in or put your phone on a charging plate every night and leaving it there, while avoiding letting the battery go below 30% charge.
20:57:44 <TheJollyRoger> Trying to go all power-user with your phone's battery is what causes battery damage now.
20:57:54 <nscnt[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6090612?hl=en
20:58:34 <nscnt[m]> Especially take a look at "Charge steadily overnight"
20:58:37 <pallaf[m]> Alright I thought charging it from 30 too 100 would be almost a full load cycle
20:58:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Idle maintenance only kicks at 100% battery, plugged in and idle afaik
20:58:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you kind of need to
20:58:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> pallaf: you can just leave your phone always connected
20:59:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Little to no degradation at all
20:59:06 <TheJollyRoger> pallaf[m]: ten years ago, this was the case, but batteries have since moved on since.
20:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> A lot has changed in ten years!
20:59:44 <pallaf[m]> i see
21:00:28 <TheJollyRoger> If you have an old mp3 player from 2003 that doesn't have an idle shutoff, then sure, by all means, manage your charge manually.
21:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> Or if you have some old batteries that use NiMH or NiCd batteries from the 1990's that are inexplicably in full working order, you will need to deep cycle them.
21:01:07 <TheJollyRoger> But don't do that with a modern phone or you will wreck the battery.
21:01:29 <TheJollyRoger> The onboard computer in the batteries will manage charge far, far more effectively than you ever could.
21:01:49 <TheJollyRoger> *some old gadgets that use NiMH or NiCd
21:04:00 <TheJollyRoger> But that's ~20 years ago.
21:04:48 <TheJollyRoger> (WRT NiMH and NiCd batteries.)
21:07:16 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, I'd say now that NiMH batteries are even on the way out, except for some consumer gadgets that are hobbled by backwards compatibility and use off the shelf batteries, and flashlights, where the need to be able to have large amounts of relatively cheap, interchangeable batteries outweighs the convenience factor and design shortcomings of integrated batteries.
21:35:50 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> <nscnt[m] "Especially take a look at "Charg"> Does that work on Graphene, though?
21:36:29 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I don't see "Adaptive charging" in battery settings
21:37:36 <pallaf[m]> SkyFox [kde.org]: https://9to5google.com/2020/12/29/pixel-adaptive-charging/
21:37:53 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I get that it's based on alarms
21:38:03 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> But does it require the ROM to support this?
21:38:45 <pallaf[m]> apparently its only above pixel 4 which I don't have :(
21:39:03 <pallaf[m]>  * apparently its only available for pixel 4 and above which I don't have :(
21:44:44 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> I personally charge the phone up to 100% when I go to sleep and then unplug it for the night
21:44:45 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
21:45:05 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Also disable always on display
21:45:20 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> It looses like ~2-3% of the charge during the night
21:45:34 <TheJollyRoger> SkyFox[kdeorg][m: that kind of thing is going to be what places strain on your battery, since you're no longer using idle maintenance.
21:45:55 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> What is idle maintaince?
21:46:15 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> The Google link also says this:
21:46:15 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> > Tip: Your phone warms up when it's plugged in, so don't keep it charging more than needed
21:46:36 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall right, idle maintenance is where it's suspending the battery, so it won't charge more than necessary.
21:46:46 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Interesting
21:47:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Like I said, the battery's onboard computer will manage charge far more effectively than you ever could.
21:47:40 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> > <@skyfox:kde.org> The Google link also says this:
21:47:40 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> > > Tip: Your phone warms up when it's plugged in, so don't keep it charging more than needed
21:47:40 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> What about this, though?
21:48:32 <TheJollyRoger> What I gather from that is that it's saying don't use the battery heavily or use older generation slow charging. Let the phone decide and use the charger that it came with.
21:49:23 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Yeah, I would actually prefer slow charging over night, but I am not sure, if I have any slow chargers around
21:49:42 <TheJollyRoger> Let the phone decide.
21:49:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Ok
21:50:32 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Good to know, now I can just go to sleep without worrying about unplugging the phone 😅
21:50:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
21:52:19 <TheJollyRoger> Modern phones are /designed/ for the contingency that the majority of users will place them through, so, just use them like a normal user would.
22:47:26 <AppAraat[m]> uh, how do I actually restore the Seedvault backup? I copied the `.SeedVaultAndroidBackup` to `/storage/emulated/0/` but when I go to Settings -> System -> Backup... it's showing me an entirely different mnemonic.
22:48:02 <AppAraat[m]> The [official wiki](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault/wiki/) is also pretty light on the documentation
22:48:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hi AppAraat[m], so far I've only restored Seedvault backups from the launcher using a USB drive. I don't known if you can restore after you're past the launcher.
22:48:32 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. Well looks like I might have to get onto that >_<.
22:49:30 <AppAraat[m]> TheJollyRoger: what do you mean with the launcher? Like the wizard type thing that you get after a reset?
22:49:42 <TheJollyRoger> AppAraat[m]: yes.
22:49:59 <AppAraat[m]> oh man, I hope there's another way. I already donned the previous phone.
22:50:19 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know if it supports that yet, sorry.
23:06:20 <strcat[m]> AppAraat: you can manually launch the activity with `am` in `adb shell` but at the moment Seedvault intends for people to use it during the setup wizard
23:07:01 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Well, whew, I see, I'm going to make a note of that.
23:07:35 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I'm planning to finish a draft of a "troubleshooting" section, would you prefer me to do the same thing I did earlier and do a separate commit for each entry?
23:07:51 <SkyFox[kdeorg][m> Btw, do I need to backup each user profile separately?
23:17:31 <AppAraat[m]> 🤔
23:17:38 <AppAraat[m]> Why did I receive a notification from this room?
23:25:51 <illustratorius[m> <AppAraat[m] "🤔"> Because it is the best room
23:27:38 <mynacol[m]> <SkyFox[kdeorg][m "Btw, do I need to backup each us"> I believe so
23:36:35 <temp48> hi
23:37:16 <temp48> can i ask questions about graphene here?
23:37:34 <mynacol[m]> temp48 Hi, sure
23:38:15 <mynacol[m]> If its not directly related, you could move to #grapheneos-offtopic
23:38:28 <mynacol[m]> *with Graphene OS
23:40:03 <temp48> i want to adopt a device with graphene; pixel 4 prices are almost at pixel 5 prices new; is it a better option to pick a pixel 5?will graphene be released for this device or is here a technical limitation that means it will not?
23:53:05 <pnrxa[m]> I've opted for a 4 XL which actually has better specs than a 5. I already have one but I just bought another for under 500 AUD (cheaper than a 4a)
23:53:51 <pnrxa[m]> Second hand though
23:54:03 <TheJollyRoger> temp48: Right now Pixel 5 is being worked on, but we can't commit to an ETA at this time, not without another maintainer to step up and do the maintenance work.
23:55:02 <TheJollyRoger> temp48: your best bet if you want a device for running GrapheneOS is to buy a 4a. That will have the best value for your money.
23:57:51 <temp48> ok thanks guys; agree the 4 xl has best specs and 4a is best value; honestly was trying to avoid having to purchase a 5G compatible phone later, but if this is going to be a long wait, its rather a moot point!
