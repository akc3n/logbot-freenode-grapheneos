00:11:48 <bizanon[m]> is it possible to add a "multi-account container" - like feature on vanadium?
00:12:40 <copperhead-fanbo> <bizanon[m] "is it possible to add a "multi-a"> Like second vanadium app?
00:12:58 <copperhead-fanbo> Or in other words duping the app
00:12:59 <bizanon[m]> no something like this https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/
00:13:19 <bizanon[m]> something that saves cookie sessions
00:13:27 <bizanon[m]> and isolates between profiles
00:13:44 <copperhead-fanbo> There is
00:14:17 <IRCX6[m]> Just use a Second User
00:14:22 <copperhead-fanbo> Let me try to find it
00:14:33 <bizanon[m]> <IRCX6[m] "Just use a Second User "> ahhh! thank you
00:15:20 <copperhead-fanbo> <bizanon[m] "ahhh! thank you"> that works else
00:15:31 <bizanon[m]> <copperhead-fanbo "that works else"> what did you have in mind?
00:15:32 <matrix_with_tele> Vanadium (also Chromium) use Site Isolation
00:16:09 <bizanon[m]> im not trying to do site isolation. im trying to save cookie sessions regardless of sites
00:16:10 <grapheneos_user_> not-copperhead-fanboy: Nice username
00:16:21 <IRCX6[m]> Or use Bromite and Vanadium to do Browser Isolation
00:16:34 <IRCX6[m]> Bromite for specific Sites only
00:16:49 <bizanon[m]> I need more than 2 profiles 😂
00:19:30 <dannyknoll3[m]> bizanon: Android profiles help a lot for this, in some usecases
00:19:56 <bizanon[m]> yeah im gonna do that thank you IRCX6:  dannyknoll3
00:20:04 <copperhead-fanbo> <bizanon[m] "what did you have in mind?"> https://fossbytes.com/android-instant-apps-no-installation-storage/ something like this
00:20:26 <bizanon[m]> interesting
00:20:40 <thematrix[m]> Do you guys know of anything besides Sudo that provides numbers
00:20:48 <thematrix[m]> *multiple numbers at once
00:21:24 <copperhead-fanbo> Prepay simcard, voip calling
00:22:01 <bizanon[m]> <copperhead-fanbo "https://fossbytes.com/android-in"> is this already a thing?
00:22:09 <copperhead-fanbo> <bizanon[m] "is this already a thing?"> Yeah
00:22:34 <copperhead-fanbo> For me it works fine
00:22:50 <copperhead-fanbo> Thats what i use for shopping
00:22:58 <copperhead-fanbo> Without installing the app
00:22:58 <bizanon[m]> can you tel lme a practical usecase?
00:23:08 <bizanon[m]> oh i see
00:23:10 <copperhead-fanbo> Less tracking
00:23:28 <bizanon[m]> and not all sites support it right?
00:23:40 <copperhead-fanbo> * Less tracking, less access,
00:23:49 <copperhead-fanbo> Not all sadly
00:24:11 <copperhead-fanbo> But im not 100% sure about that
00:24:19 <copperhead-fanbo> Amazon work for me
00:24:37 <bizanon[m]> what about banking apps
00:25:37 <IRCX6[m]> <copperhead-fanbo "https://fossbytes.com/android-in"> Where do I install it?
00:26:10 <copperhead-fanbo> Oh thats good one i haven't tested that one yet.
00:27:08 <thematrix[m]> That works on Graphene.
00:27:29 <copperhead-fanbo> <IRCX6[m] "Where do I install it?"> I have to look that up as well
00:27:51 <copperhead-fanbo> Since long time ago  that i used it
00:28:19 <IRCX6[m]> Oh yeahhh
00:28:21 <IRCX6[m]> I found it
00:28:29 <IRCX6[m]> In settings
00:28:58 <bizanon[m]> can you check if wells fargo bankign app works with that IRCX6:  😂
00:29:21 <copperhead-fanbo> bizanon thanks to you i fix my issue with shitty bank app
00:29:21 <bizanon[m]> I dont have GOS installed yet
00:29:29 <copperhead-fanbo> With many trackers
00:32:12 <b1101> my chase bank app doesn't work without google services of sorts :(, but I can live without it
00:34:10 <bizanon[m]> I still have GOS on my old pixel 2. I have a pixel 5 but haven't installed GOS yet

00:34:49 <bizanon[m]> On the most recent GOS ver, is it possible to add email accounts on the account setting?
00:35:13 <copperhead-fanbo> Yes
00:35:21 <copperhead-fanbo> But you need a mail app
00:35:26 <bizanon[m]> Which emails are allowed? Not Gmail's I'm assuimg
00:36:16 <copperhead-fanbo> You can fairmail but i use k-9 mail since is bit more cleaner
00:36:29 <bizanon[m]> does outlook work?
00:36:31 <b1101> also use k-9.
00:37:31 <copperhead-fanbo> > <@bizanon:matrix.org> does outlook work?
00:37:31 <copperhead-fanbo> >
00:37:31 <copperhead-fanbo> You can try
00:38:50 <IRCX6[m]> What email provider do y'all use?
00:38:51 <bizanon[m]> whats the domain name for k9?
00:38:54 <TheJollyRoger> copperhead-fanbo: Assuming no ill intent, you may want to change your name. This channel occasionally gets brigaded, and it really doesn't look great to have a chat handle like that...
00:38:56 <copperhead-fanbo> * fairmail better security, k-9 mail better interface
00:39:14 <copperhead-fanbo> <TheJollyRoger "not-copperhead-fanboy: Assuming "> Sure i will change it
00:39:28 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks :). Welcome aboard.
00:39:30 <dnull> copperhead-fanbo: I run my own.
00:39:33 <legendwin> Is there any reason why I should prefer to use the CLI over the WebUSB installation?
00:39:52 <dnull> Err, IRCX6[m]
00:40:12 <TheJollyRoger> legendwin: The only reason why you would use the CLI method over WebUSB is if you're installing GrapheneOS to many handsets all at the same time.
00:40:17 <dnull> legendwin: Not really. The web install is easier.
00:40:38 <TheJollyRoger> *to many and many different types of handsets all at the same time.
00:40:42 <bizanon[m]> not-fanboy: do you need to buy a domain bbefore using k9?
00:40:52 <dnull> bizanon[m]: Nope
00:41:03 <legendwin> Thanks @TheJollyRoger @dnull
00:41:03 <bizanon[m]> oh interesting. you can make up any domain then?
00:41:09 <dnull> Just a mail client.
00:41:16 <TheJollyRoger> legendwin: yeah, if you're installing to just one or two handsets, the WebUSB method is faster.
00:41:40 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: web install caches the downloads as long as there's a lot of disk space so it works fine for that
00:41:44 <dnull> bizanon[m]: Well, it needs to be an actual one, and you have an account on it.
00:41:50 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, I see, makes sense.
00:41:53 <bizanon[m]> <dnull "Just a mail client."> so k9 has their own servers?
00:41:58 <dnull> bizanon[m]: You can't spoof.
00:42:33 <bizanon[m]> so can you do gmail on the k9 app? im confused
00:42:41 <dnull> bizanon[m]: No I mean it's just a client, you still need a server to connect to.
00:43:07 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: yes, you can do GMail on K9, but not with Advanced Protection Program, if I recall right.
00:43:12 <dnull> Not sure if gmail still offers imap, but if they do then yes.
00:43:16 <TheJollyRoger> They do.
00:43:48 <b1101> ya, just have to "allow insecure apps".
00:44:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
00:44:13 <strcat[m]> Advanced Protection Program disables that and there are no app passwords
00:45:32 <IRCX6[m]> What email do y'all recommend? I'm currently on CripText
00:45:54 <b1101> fairmail apparently allows oauth2, but google services are required;so not in our case. is there an open source email client that allows oauth2, or is it not possible on graphene?
00:46:52 <bizanon[m]> <IRCX6[m] "What email do y'all recommend? I"> yeah im interested as well. which email provider do you guys use?
00:47:52 <copperhead-fanbo> <bizanon[m] "not-fanboy: do you need to buy a"> Not yet
00:48:44 <TheJollyRoger> Email providers aren't really topical to #GrapheneOS, but I'd be happy to see you guys have that discussion over in #GrapheneOS-Offtopic!
00:49:03 <IRCX6[m]> I kinda like CripText because it allows an anonymous registration. All it needs is a Captcha and a Recovery email
00:49:19 <IRCX6[m]> You can add a Guerilla mail email as the Recovery email
00:49:34 <IRCX6[m]> And you can register through Tor
00:49:40 <IRCX6[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Email providers aren't really to"> Ok
00:50:17 <bizanon[m]> does criptext app work on gos? IRCX6:
00:50:30 <IRCX6[m]> Yes
00:50:39 <bizanon[m]> cool
00:50:41 <bizanon[m]> thanks
00:57:32 <anonxyz[m]> How to make a new sip dialer app appear as an option for default call manager in system configuration ?
00:58:18 <copperhead-fanbo> <IRCX6[m] "I kinda like CripText because it"> Criptext sounds cool, let me check it out
00:58:24 <anonxyz[m]> I'm setting up VoIP as my default calling method but I can't get the app to appear as default
00:58:54 <copperhead-fanbo> <anonxyz[m] "I'm setting up VoIP as my defaul"> Default apps settings?
00:59:14 <copperhead-fanbo> Or you can use adb
00:59:36 <strcat[m]> don't need adb
00:59:40 <thematrix[m]> Now that we're on the topic I just watched a video on how easy it is to decrypt SIP over TLS and SRTP
00:59:52 <thematrix[m]> Does this also apply to VOIP?
01:00:12 <strcat[m]> carrier-based texts/calls trust the networks
01:00:14 <strcat[m]> and aren't secure
01:00:21 <strcat[m]> if you want secure calls, use a secure calling app
01:00:36 <strcat[m]> using a different way of connecting to the traditional carrier-based text/call infra doesn't make it secure
01:03:43 <not-fanboy[m]> @stcat you can remove my other account if you want. :)
01:04:06 <strcat[m]> it's fine
01:04:16 <TheJollyRoger> Hey not-fanboy[m], you should be alright now!
01:04:21 <strcat[m]> the matrix irc bridge is currently really aggressive and kicks people after 30 days of not saying stuff anyway
01:04:34 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome back!
01:04:50 <not-fanboy[m]> 🙂
01:07:29 <not-fanboy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Welcome back!"> Are you a mod or dev?
01:08:54 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: I am a moderator on the IRC side, I am not a developer, but I am the channel greeter.
01:08:54 <thematrix[m]> <anonxyz[m] "How to make a new sip dialer app"> Are you using twilio for phone numbers?
01:09:18 <TheJollyRoger> At least, that's what I prefer to call myself, rather than a "moderator" I prefer the title "greeter."
01:09:54 <not-fanboy[m]> Both way works for me
01:11:34 <PNDMT12345[m]> Which MicroG app should  I download for Pixel phone?
01:12:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hello PNDMT12345[m], unfortunately MicroG isn't supported on GrapheneOS.
01:13:19 <PNDMT12345[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hello PNDMT12345, unfortunately "> Oh. Then what's the alternative available for location service?
01:13:29 <not-fanboy[m]> Something else but i thought it might be cool if there where simple / quick tutorial video's like how to setup a mail
01:13:31 <strcat[m]> PNDMT12345: you don't need anything special for location to work
01:13:40 <strcat[m]> PNDMT12345: GNSS-based location is built-in
01:13:55 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS supports location via GPS, but you need to let it calibrate after you switch the phone on for the first time.
01:13:57 <strcat[m]> we intend to offer more functionality later, but it won't involve anything to do with Google services
01:14:29 <anonxyz[m]> <thematrix[m] "Are you using twilio for phone n"> No I'm experimenting with JMP service + CsipSimple app as my call manager, seems to be working well
01:15:07 <bizanon[m]> is it possible to spoof GPS on GOS?
01:15:16 <not-fanboy[m]> Yeah
01:15:28 <not-fanboy[m]> There is a app for it on fdroid
01:15:32 <anonxyz[m]> Twilio is difficult to use anonymously, Jmp can be paid for with crypto 😉
01:15:52 <bizanon[m]> does that app really spoof it for real tho?
01:15:58 <not-fanboy[m]> Yeah
01:16:04 <not-fanboy[m]> I used for pokemon go
01:16:10 <bizanon[m]> ahh kk
01:16:10 <not-fanboy[m]> Long time ago
01:16:37 <bizanon[m]> like if you take a picture with the spoofed GPS, it will show the spoofed coordinates in the EXIF data
01:16:55 <not-fanboy[m]> https://f-droid.org/packages/com.wesaphzt.privatelocation/ here yo go
01:17:06 <bizanon[m]> ahh thank you
01:17:17 <not-fanboy[m]> <bizanon[m] "like if you take a picture with "> Yup
01:17:20 <strcat[m]> the camera app doesn't use Location by default
01:17:28 <strcat[m]> you would have to enable that feature
01:17:31 <thematrix[m]> I google JMP and only found sopranica. Do you set up the accounts straight from the device or do you use a desktop?
01:17:33 <strcat[m]> and grant it the permission after enabling it
01:17:38 <IRCX6[m]> Or just use ObscuraCam
01:17:42 <bizanon[m]> I see strcat:  thanks
01:17:51 <IRCX6[m]> Off of the Guardian Project
01:17:58 <strcat[m]> bizanon: apps do not have location access without you explicitly granting Location
01:18:01 <strcat[m]> bizanon: same as other permissions
01:18:02 <IRCX6[m]> It doesn't have any Exit data when you take a pic
01:18:08 <strcat[m]> bizanon: don't give them access if you don't want them having access
01:18:16 <strcat[m]> bizanon: same as other data, permissions and access control
01:18:28 <thematrix[m]> jmp.chat dound it
01:18:29 <not-fanboy[m]> Strcat why does dialer app has network access by default?
01:18:34 <bizanon[m]> what happens if you gran an app permission to folders. What kind of information will that give to the app? strcat:
01:18:38 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: why wouldn't it?
01:18:53 <strcat[m]> bizanon: if you grant an app access to data, it has access to the data you granted
01:18:56 <not-fanboy[m]> Why does it even need network access
01:18:58 <strcat[m]> bizanon: straightforward
01:19:05 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: because it uses the network
01:19:39 <strcat[m]> multiple aspects of it use the network
01:19:39 <not-fanboy[m]> Any reason why?
01:19:40 <strcat[m]> making calls
01:19:40 <not-fanboy[m]> Thats weird
01:19:40 <strcat[m]> getting voicemail
01:19:40 <strcat[m]> why is that weird?
01:20:13 <strcat[m]> voicemail uses network
01:20:14 <bizanon[m]> strcat: im talking about "Storage" set to allowed. Or I forgot what its called exactly. Its like a picture of a folder
01:20:14 <strcat[m]> modern calls use network
01:20:14 <strcat[m]> and it has custom SIP support too
01:20:15 <strcat[m]> rather than only VoLTE SIP
01:20:18 <not-fanboy[m]> Since i use a other dialer app without network access and that works fine
01:20:27 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's explained by the OS
01:20:39 <strcat[m]> bizanon: each profile has a home directory for your files outside of app storage
01:20:50 <strcat[m]> bizanon: apps can request case-by-case access where you choose a file/directory
01:21:02 <strcat[m]> bizanon: or, if they're legacy apps, they likely request access to it as a whole
01:21:07 <strcat[m]> which you should generally not grant
01:21:24 <strcat[m]> apps usually store their data in their own storage
01:21:28 <strcat[m]> they don't need any perm for that
01:21:53 <strcat[m]> they only need a permission to access the user profile's home directory files, and the proper way to do it is requesting case-by-case access the user controls
01:21:58 <bizanon[m]> so apps inside a particular user profile only has access to the user profile folders not the entire system? And does it include like phone make/model ? or any other sensitive info? Im assuming it knows what apps you have installed
01:22:11 <strcat[m]> go back and read what I wrote
01:22:12 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: There was a question I wanted to ask about that, actually... if say, hypothetically, we were willing to break backwards compatibility, could disable non-scoped storage, or change the minimum API version to a more recent one, and prevent older apps from simply requesting access to the entire shared storage partition?
01:22:20 <strcat[m]> bizanon: can't just answer it again
01:22:36 <strcat[m]> bizanon: an app does not have access to the profile's home directory, unless you *explicitly* grant it
01:22:47 <strcat[m]> bizanon: and only legacy apps request full access to it like that
01:23:11 <strcat[m]> that has been phased out, some app developers are particularly slow to adopt it largely because they don't like respecting user consent / control
01:23:15 <strcat[m]> even open source apps don't like that
01:23:19 <IRCX6[m]> Guys is there any need for tape on my phone camera when I already have the sensors off feature on?
01:23:36 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: the camera is controlled by the camera permission, not sensors, you seem confused
01:23:50 <bizanon[m]> i tried installing a banking app and it asked me to grant access to storage. I said NO. But wondering what info might be leaked if I say YES
01:23:52 <strcat[m]> sensors is for sensors not covered by specific permissions already
01:23:55 <not-fanboy[m]> <IRCX6[m] "Guys is there any need for tape "> Only for android exploit
01:23:58 <strcat[m]> bizanon: explained above
01:24:10 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: no need for taping over the camera. Apps aren't allowed to access the cameras and turn them on unless you give them "CAMERA" permission.
01:24:16 * IRCX6[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20210227-192404.png (98KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QnxItOINmnKlvjnlZNBajaHH/Screenshot_20210227-192404.png >
01:24:20 <strcat[m]> bizanon: apps have access to their own storage by default
01:24:36 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: that's a development feature and is not related to the Sensors permission
01:24:43 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: again, you seem confused
01:24:50 <IRCX6[m]> So do I need tape
01:24:51 <not-fanboy[m]> Huh
01:24:56 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: no, tape is not required.
01:25:00 <IRCX6[m]> Ok
01:25:05 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: apps cannot access camera, microphone, etc. unless you grant them access to it
01:25:06 <IRCX6[m]> I'll take it off rn
01:25:14 <TheJollyRoger> "Sensors" are for the phone determining if your phone is upside-down, if it's moving, turning around, etc.
01:25:21 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: and even if you do grant them access, it's only possible to grant it in the foreground
01:25:30 <strcat[m]> an app you have granted camera access can't access it in the background
01:25:30 <bizanon[m]> "apps have access to their own storage by default" Okay so that means, even if you say YES to storage, they can't access any folders outside their designated storage?strcat:
01:25:33 <not-fanboy[m]> Camera or mic wont work with sensors off
01:25:40 <strcat[m]> bizanon: not what I said
01:25:49 <strcat[m]> bizanon: not going to able to continue the conversation, sorry
01:25:57 <strcat[m]> bizanon: you need to go back and read my original responses
01:26:11 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Camera or mic will still work with the sensor permission denied, sensors are different than camera or microphone.
01:26:18 <strcat[m]> bizanon: you're not understanding and you just need to read my original response
01:26:35 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: the sensors refer to the phone's motion/tilt sensors.
01:26:46 <strcat[m]> bizanon: I don't want to repeat myself multiple times, I don't think it will be helpful
01:26:48 <not-fanboy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "not-fanboy: Camera or mic will s"> Strange
01:26:57 <IRCX6[m]> If you turn on the sensors off with the feature
01:26:59 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: nothing strange about that
01:27:04 <IRCX6[m]> The camera won't work
01:27:06 <IRCX6[m]> Or the mic
01:27:13 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: that is a development feature
01:27:14 <not-fanboy[m]> My camera app wont work with sensors off im confused
01:27:19 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: it is not what is being discussed
01:27:25 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: that is a development feature
01:27:27 <strcat[m]> not what is being discussed above

01:27:41 <IRCX6[m]> <strcat[m] "not what is being discussed abov"> I know I'm just saying
01:27:45 <IRCX6[m]> Bruh
01:28:01 <IRCX6[m]> <not-fanboy[m] "Strange"> I was referring to this
01:28:14 <strcat[m]> Camera, Microphone permissions control access to those
01:28:18 <strcat[m]> you have to explicitly grant them
01:28:19 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: My camera works with sensors permission disabled, the only difference is that now it can't tell when my phone is sideways.
01:28:20 <not-fanboy[m]> No
01:28:24 <strcat[m]> once you grant them, they permit access in the foreground
01:28:47 <strcat[m]> the Sensors permission (NOT what you are showing / talking about) is for other sensors, not those covered by the existing permissions
01:29:06 <strcat[m]> Sensors permission is for non-Camera, non-Microphone, non-Body Sensors, etc. sensors
01:29:12 <strcat[m]> i.e. sensors not covered by existing permissions
01:29:21 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: if you're on an older release of the operating system and on a Pixel 3 there is a bug in the driver for the camera. Subsequent releases of the operating system have rolled out a fix.
01:29:24 <strcat[m]> it is the 'other sensors' permission added by GrapheneOS, not a standard one
01:29:32 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: not what they're talking about
01:29:36 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: oh.
01:29:41 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
01:29:58 <bizanon[m]> ok I understand now strcat:  Sorry aboutr that.
01:29:58 <bizanon[m]> So why would banking app ask permission for storage if they already have their own storage designated?
01:29:58 <bizanon[m]> Is it for fingerprinting purposes?
01:30:28 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the storage permission is a legacy way to request access to all the user's files
01:30:36 <strcat[m]> bizanon: no longer supported for modern apps
01:30:48 <strcat[m]> bizanon: there are per-app storage directories never accessible to other apps
01:30:51 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: I can think of a few reasons: one being, they're being lazy. Two, they want to save something you can later copy off that phone.
01:30:58 <strcat[m]> bizanon: and then there's your profile home directory, with your own files, outside of app storage
01:31:11 <strcat[m]> bizanon: proper apps request case-by-case access to files/directories, it opens up the system file manager UI
01:31:13 <strcat[m]> and lets you choose
01:31:18 * not-fanboy[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ISSeFuQIngMoMUKYQytflzUM/message.txt >
01:31:31 <strcat[m]> bizanon: many apps are not respectful of user consent / privacy and demand bulk access to things
01:31:50 <strcat[m]> bizanon: recommend saying no, and if it doesn't work, consider running it in a separate user profile
01:31:50 <bizanon[m]> I mean it works even if I deny storage access
01:31:57 <not-fanboy[m]> Yes
01:32:08 <strcat[m]> bizanon: yeah, so they just want to scrape all your files from your home directory probably
01:32:11 <strcat[m]> like your pictures
01:32:19 <bizanon[m]> TF
01:32:33 <IRCX6[m]> Use a second profile
01:32:36 <strcat[m]> app devs are scum and lie to users about why permissions are required
01:32:49 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh.
01:33:00 <strcat[m]> anyway you can say no
01:33:00 <not-fanboy[m]> <bizanon[m] "I mean it works even if I deny s"> They are just old apps
01:33:01 <strcat[m]> and if the app refuses to work
01:33:01 <bizanon[m]> thats fcked up.. my pictures
01:33:02 <strcat[m]> consider running it in a separate user profile where you can grant it bulk access to stuff like contacts and storage without it getting anything
01:33:27 <TheJollyRoger> Sometimes even when I try to assume "if they are acting in good faith" and then see that.
01:33:31 <strcat[m]> if it works fine after saying no
01:33:32 <strcat[m]> no problem then
01:33:54 <strcat[m]> as another example apps can request that YOU pick a contact from your contacts without the app needing a permission
01:34:02 <strcat[m]> but most apps dislike that, instead they request bulk contacts access
01:34:11 <not-fanboy[m]> My rule of thumb is if it needs access to my storage than check if there is network acesss.
01:34:13 <strcat[m]> you can use apps like Signal without granting them Contacts access btw
01:34:15 <strcat[m]> they work fine
01:34:18 <strcat[m]> some may refuse to work
01:34:46 <strcat[m]> Signal just won't know which of your contacts has Signal without you giving it your contacts to upload to their server
01:34:53 <strcat[m]> it works fine without giving it that
01:35:16 <bizanon[m]> what about phone permission? what sensitive info is leaked bt that?
01:35:25 <strcat[m]> your phone number, etc.
01:35:32 <strcat[m]> only a Dialer type app should need that
01:35:37 <not-fanboy[m]> <bizanon[m] "what about phone permission? wha"> Imei
01:35:37 <strcat[m]> or an app that needs your phone number
01:35:40 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: no
01:35:46 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Apps cannot access IMEI.
01:36:02 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
01:36:02 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Since Android 10, apps cannot access non-resettable hardware identifiers, full stop.
01:36:14 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: there is a separate privileged phone permission unavailable to anything but privileged system apps
01:36:17 <not-fanboy[m]> Even with dialer acces?
01:36:25 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: they can't see IMEI
01:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> If they try to, either they get a "Security Exception Error" or a line of zeroes.
01:36:30 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Even with dialer access.
01:36:39 <bizanon[m]> And lastly, if I grant camera access, anytime I turn on the app, the front facing camera can passively record my face right? Even tho I'm not explicitly using the camera?
01:36:46 <TheJollyRoger> If they try to, they get a security exception. Legacy apps will just get a bunch of zeroes back.
01:37:10 <not-fanboy[m]> <strcat[m] "not-fanboy: they can't see IMEI"> Juat be sure but even with dialer aceess they cant see imei?
01:37:11 <strcat[m]> bizanon: if the app has camera access, yes, when in foreground (foreground service or currently visible as an open app) it can use it
01:37:22 <strcat[m]> bizanon: instead of granting camera access permanently consider using 'allow this time'
01:37:26 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Even with dialer access, apps *cannot* see your IMEI. Full stop.
01:37:41 <IRCX6[m]> Yo guys how do I share files, With trebleshot the website is Http and it doesn't let you use a Vpn to share files
01:37:47 <not-fanboy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "not-fanboy: Even with dialer acc"> Woah, i love this os
01:37:47 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: only privileged system apps can see hw identifiers not any user installed apps or regular system apps
01:37:48 <bizanon[m]> even if you "allow this time" the bank app can still record my face in the background??
01:38:05 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: that's just standard Android 10+ feature although we remove a legacy serialno access thing for legacy apps
01:38:14 <strcat[m]> bizanon: no
01:38:17 <TheJollyRoger> Only specific legitimate system components that *have a legitimate need to in order to do their jobs* can see your IMEI, SIM card number, etc. These are not exposed to you.
01:38:19 <strcat[m]> bizanon: don't know where you're getting that now
01:38:26 <IRCX6[m]> <IRCX6[m] "Yo guys how do I share files, Wi"> Help
01:38:28 <strcat[m]> bizanon: apps can NEVER access camera, microphone or sensors in the background, flat out
01:38:39 <TheJollyRoger> So you can't give other apps that don't have a legitimate need to know your IMEI that permission.
01:38:52 <strcat[m]> bizanon: in order to use the camera, an app has to be granted camera access *and* be in the foreground
01:39:06 <strcat[m]> bizanon: if you use 'allow this time' permission grants, then the permission is revoked after the current session of using the app
01:39:07 <bizanon[m]> oh got it
01:39:15 <not-fanboy[m]> <IRCX6[m] "Help"> Use other vpn
01:39:24 <strcat[m]> 'allow this time' is a temporary grant for the current use of the app
01:39:35 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Around Android 10 Google decided enough was enough and cut off IMEI/SIM card serial number/SIM card access to apps and made it a part of the Android specification, it was a welcome move!
01:39:38 <not-fanboy[m]> * Use other vpn or play in the settings in the vpn
01:39:38 <IRCX6[m]> <not-fanboy[m] "Use other vpn"> No
01:39:39 <strcat[m]> the permanent grant for camera/microphone/sensors is also only a foreground grant
01:39:45 <strcat[m]> there is no background camera/microphone/sensors access
01:39:56 <bizanon[m]> so as long as the camera is not opened with the banking app, I shouldn't have to worry about it recording my face thru the front camera
01:39:57 <strcat[m]> if an app wants to record as a service it has to run as a user visible foreground service
01:40:04 <IRCX6[m]> <IRCX6[m] "No"> Orbot only
01:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> brb
01:40:17 <strcat[m]> bizanon: use 'allow this time' permission grants as needed
01:40:26 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the app should be asking for the permission only when it needs it anyway
01:40:33 <bizanon[m]> ahh ok
01:40:35 <strcat[m]> either way, use 'allow this time'
01:40:37 <not-fanboy[m]> <IRCX6[m] "Orbot only"> Orbot with vpn 🤔
01:40:38 <bizanon[m]> thanks for the explanations
01:40:51 <IRCX6[m]> <not-fanboy[m] "Orbot with vpn 🤔"> No, orbot is my vpn
01:40:53 <strcat[m]> bizanon: 'allow this time' will take away the access grant after the current use of the app is over
01:41:05 <strcat[m]> bizanon: the permanent allow will still *never* allow background access
01:41:14 <strcat[m]> bizanon: there is no background camera/mic/sensors access support
01:41:15 <not-fanboy[m]> <IRCX6[m] "No, orbot is my vpn"> I did try to use orbot but is so slow
01:41:21 <IRCX6[m]> <not-fanboy[m] "I did try to use orbot but is so"> No its not
01:41:32 <strcat[m]> bizanon: if an app wants to record those things while you do other stuff, it has to run a user-visible foreground service
01:41:32 <strcat[m]> as I said above
01:41:37 <strcat[m]> there's no background access to those
01:41:44 <not-fanboy[m]> <IRCX6[m] "No its not"> Not for you but for me it is
01:41:45 <IRCX6[m]> <IRCX6[m] "No its not"> Turn off No- Network auto sleep
01:42:01 <bizanon[m]> okay anoither quesiton. even tho camera WONT run in the background, lets say Im taking a pictture of my check for mobile dfeposit, They can still record my face no? Because i would be using the camera thru the app
01:42:05 <not-fanboy[m]> <IRCX6[m] "Turn off No- Network auto sleep"> I have shitty connect
01:42:33 <strcat[m]> bizanon: sure but an app does not really need to require the camera permission for that use case
01:42:46 <bizanon[m]> it asks permission tho
01:42:49 <strcat[m]> bizanon: for a one off picture an app can just open the OS camera app and have you take a picture, and give it to the app
01:42:53 <strcat[m]> bizanon: okay but that's their choice
01:42:59 <strcat[m]> they could avoid requiring the permission
01:43:08 <strcat[m]> the permission is needed for the app to implement their own camera UI
01:43:22 <strcat[m]> an app can open up the system UI and allow you to take a picture
01:43:27 <strcat[m]> without needing to require the permission
01:43:36 <bizanon[m]> lets say i grant permission. Does that permission allow both back AND front camera indiscriminantly ?
01:43:44 <strcat[m]> yes, in the foreground
01:44:03 <bizanon[m]> then they can secretly record my face if im looking at the front camera
01:44:11 <strcat[m]> not really
01:44:53 <IRCX6[m]> <strcat[m] "not really"> Do you use Orbot
01:44:58 <methodman[m]2> strcat you said earlier that only privileged apps can see hardware identifiers such as imei, where can we find apps that have this access in settings?
01:45:13 <strcat[m]> methodman: privileged apps are OS components
01:45:28 <strcat[m]> methodman: you're talking about the core OS itself, it's not something that you need to be concerned with unless you are working on the OS
01:45:37 <strcat[m]> methodman: there is no such thing as a user installed privileged app
01:45:49 <strcat[m]> methodman: the OS contains the only privileged apps which can exist, as OS components
01:45:49 <not-fanboy[m]> If your worry try out "privacy indicators" i will you will give alert when cam is being used
01:45:51 <methodman[m]2> So no app we download has the ability to see the imei then?
01:46:01 <strcat[m]> methodman: no user installed app can see those
01:46:05 <strcat[m]> methodman: covered in the FAQ
01:46:07 <not-fanboy[m]> * If your worry try out "privacy indicators" it will give alert when cam is being used
01:46:11 <strcat[m]> methodman: https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
01:46:13 <strcat[m]> please read FAQ
01:46:24 <bizanon[m]> <strcat[m] "not really"> so is that a hard NO or somewhere between yes and a no?
01:46:31 <methodman[m]2> <strcat[m] "methodman: covered in the FAQ"> Thank you. I must have missed that. Read the FAQ some time ago
01:46:46 <not-fanboy[m]> <methodman[m]2 "So no app we download has the ab"> No
01:47:16 <strcat[m]> methodman: pre-Android-10, the Phone permission granted access to those things
01:47:21 <strcat[m]> methodman: post-Android-10, it does not
01:47:25 <strcat[m]> there is a separate OS-only permission for it
01:47:37 <strcat[m]> for the OS to use internally for principle of least privilege
01:47:49 <methodman[m]2> Cool stuff. Thank you for the clarification!
01:47:52 <strcat[m]> many OS components are just regular apps with no more privileges than a user installed app can get
01:48:06 <strcat[m]> other OS components are privileged apps where the OS lists out a list of special privileged permissions for them
01:48:12 <strcat[m]> it's just how the OS itself is built internally
01:48:23 <strcat[m]> OS components have as few privileges as possible
01:48:39 <strcat[m]> you really don't need to deal with it yourself, it's the responsibility of the OS devs
01:48:41 <strcat[m]> and it's part of the OS
01:48:48 <not-fanboy[m]> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitish.privacyindicator
01:49:40 <not-fanboy[m]> If your worry about your cam is being used
01:49:40 <IRCX6[m]> <not-fanboy[m] "https://play.google.com/store/ap"> Cool
01:49:41 <not-fanboy[m]> It give me peace of mind
01:50:19 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend just not granting access to anything but the OS Camera app
01:50:27 <strcat[m]> and if you do use 'allow this time'
01:50:46 <strcat[m]> same for Microphone
01:51:09 <strcat[m]> you can take a picture with the OS camera app then give it to a messaging app, etc.
01:51:19 <strcat[m]> without giving messaging app legacy storage access either
01:51:24 <not-fanboy[m]> Speaking of fotos
01:51:34 <strcat[m]> even if the app doesn't support proper case-by-case file access
01:51:38 <strcat[m]> you can share files to the app
01:51:49 <strcat[m]> so you can do it the other way around
01:51:53 <strcat[m]> even for terrible apps
01:52:00 <not-fanboy[m]> Can apps make screenshots any time they want?
01:52:07 <IRCX6[m]> Guys if I delete a photo is there still a chance of it being recovered?
01:52:08 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: screenshots?
01:52:13 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: apps can't record other apps
01:52:27 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: or the system UI
01:52:36 <not-fanboy[m]> <strcat[m] "not-fanboy: screenshots?"> On your screen
01:52:43 <not-fanboy[m]> Of your screen
01:52:46 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: apps can't record your screen (system UI, other apps)
01:52:53 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: they know what content is displayed by themselves
01:53:01 <not-fanboy[m]> No just a screenshot
01:53:15 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: no, they can't take a screenshot, they can't see the system ui or other apps
01:53:20 <strcat[m]> they know what content they display themselves
01:53:24 <strcat[m]> that isn't a screenshot
01:53:26 <IRCX6[m]>  if I delete a photo off the Default Gallery app is there still a chance of the Photo being recovered?
01:53:31 <not-fanboy[m]> Last thing
01:53:36 <strcat[m]> IRCX6: read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
01:53:57 <not-fanboy[m]> Apps have access to my installed apps
01:54:11 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: they know which apps are installed *in the same profile as them*
01:54:25 <not-fanboy[m]> Is there way to bloxk that
01:54:31 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: inherently, even if they had access to the lists removed, they would be able to figure it out
01:54:32 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: no
01:54:35 <not-fanboy[m]> * Is there way to block that
01:54:55 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: it isn't possible to implement it either without a much more substantial feature doing much more than that
01:55:07 <strcat[m]> apps within a profile can communicate with mutual consent
01:55:23 <strcat[m]> even if an app didn't have access to any APIs for listing other apps it can figure out which are installed
01:55:25 <strcat[m]> again though
01:55:27 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: I have a chatlog you might want to read, actually.
01:55:28 <strcat[m]> this is within a profile
01:55:30 <TheJollyRoger> Give me a moment and I will dig it up.
01:55:32 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a sec.
01:55:35 <strcat[m]> apps can't share data or communicate across user profiles
01:55:54 <not-fanboy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "not-fanboy: I have a chatlog you"> Yeah, Sure
01:55:55 <strcat[m]> not-fanboy: this is tied into communication between apps within a profile, it's not separable from it
01:56:17 <strcat[m]> and I really strongly recommend reading our FAQ and usage guide
01:56:22 <strcat[m]> which covers many of these things
01:56:27 <strcat[m]> and the time spent answering stuff covered there
01:56:33 <strcat[m]> could instead be spent covering more stuff there
01:56:48 <not-fanboy[m]> <strcat[m] "not-fanboy: this is tied into co"> I did read it but it miss somethings
01:58:50 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: here: https://paste.debian.net/1187251 It's a bit about profile functionality.
01:59:28 <TheJollyRoger> In this example, I compare hypothesize seven apps:
02:00:03 <TheJollyRoger> NSASocial, NSAChat, NSASingAlong, NSAMyRadio, and AndroMail, AndroCrypt, and SecureText, and explain a bit about what this means.
02:00:23 <TheJollyRoger> Er, well, about profile functionality and interprocess communication.
02:01:43 <not-fanboy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "not-fanboy: here: https://paste."> Webaite doesn't work
02:01:52 <not-fanboy[m]> * Website doesn't work
02:02:05 <not-fanboy[m]> I hate this keyboard layout
02:02:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'll find another paste location. One moment.
02:02:55 <not-fanboy[m]> Okie
02:04:54 <TheJollyRoger> Rrgh. Nevermind, going to just fire up my VPS for a sec.
02:05:23 <TheJollyRoger> Just a mo'
02:05:37 <louipc> try gist
02:05:45 <not-fanboy[m]> <not-fanboy[m] "Okie"> 🤔
02:08:29 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: ok, see if you can visit https://jollyrogers.ca/public/nsa-social.txt
02:09:50 <not-fanboy[m]> Thus works, thanks
02:10:07 <not-fanboy[m]> * This works, thanks (keyboard...)
02:10:15 <TheJollyRoger> The takeaway from this example is that the apps are still sandboxed even within the same profile; even if you were to install an evil app, it can't start invading the good apps unless the good apps agree to what the evil app is doing.
02:11:32 <TheJollyRoger> Note that /none/ of the apps can actually invade each other's private app space.
02:11:59 <TheJollyRoger> Not without the app that's being accessed giving that data away and specifically opting into it with the specific app that requests it.
02:12:14 <TheJollyRoger> And apps cannot reach across profiles.
02:12:23 <TheJollyRoger> that's very, very specifically not allowed.
02:12:45 <TheJollyRoger> There are limits on what an app can do within a given profile. This should help to explain a bit about how.
02:12:49 <not-fanboy[m]> What worry's me is well. lets said my bank app has google trackers with those trackers they can see which apps i have installed
02:13:30 <TheJollyRoger> Then you can use your bank's web UI.
02:13:30 <strcat> not-fanboy[m]: and?
02:13:44 <strcat> not-fanboy[m]: you're free to use user profiles anyway
02:13:53 <strcat> not-fanboy[m]: as said earlier, apps cannot communicate or share data across profiles
02:14:00 <TheJollyRoger> If you put the app into a different profile, then it can't enumerate apps in other profiles.
02:14:01 <strcat> they can't see which apps are in a different profile
02:14:04 <not-fanboy[m]> <strcat "not-fanboy: and?"> With my real name
02:14:05 <TheJollyRoger> Nor communicate with it.
02:14:13 <not-fanboy[m]> So google knows that is  me
02:14:22 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Then you can use your bank's Website, rather than the app.
02:14:24 <strcat> not-fanboy[m]: okay first of all
02:14:31 <strcat> not-fanboy[m]: you have an incorrect understanding of what those SDKs do in apps
02:14:51 <not-fanboy[m]> <TheJollyRoger "not-fanboy: Then you can use you"> But then i have to jeep having to login..
02:14:57 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to switch my VPS off.
02:15:01 <not-fanboy[m]> * But then i have to keep having to login..
02:15:21 <TheJollyRoger> not-fanboy[m]: Well, you can then use auto-fill.
02:15:27 <not-fanboy[m]> <strcat "not-fanboy: you have an incorrec"> Oh
02:15:29 <rny> 🥴
02:15:36 <IRCX6[m]> How do I use Google Safely?
02:15:55 * rny cant really tell if people asking questions are trolling
02:15:56 <strcat[m]> I don't think a lot of these questions belong in this room
02:16:00 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: That topic isn't really topical to GrapheneOS...
02:16:17 <strcat[m]> it's a requirement to do research / reading before asking questions here
02:16:28 <strcat[m]> ask a question after you have tried to understand something based on research with good sources
02:16:45 <TheJollyRoger> Also "to use it safely" is a question that can't really be answered. If you're worried about Google causing a plane to fall out of the sky and crash into your house, you can simply use it as you normally would, because that's not a danger.
02:16:59 <strcat[m]> please be respectful of other people's time
02:17:23 <strcat[m]> not able to spend hours here walking people through things and stopping the channel from being derailed or used to spread misinformation
02:17:33 <strcat[m]> this isn't a good first place to go for info
02:17:40 <strcat[m]> because it requires other people's time
02:17:56 <strcat[m]> ask questions after trying to understand stuff 1st
02:18:08 <strcat[m]> and something like how to 'use Google safety' is just not a good fit for this channel
02:18:17 <strcat[m]> since it's not specifically related to GrapheneOS
02:18:43 <strcat[m]> there's #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org but still need to put some effort into finding info and asking a specific question
02:18:47 <strcat[m]> not something overly vague, broad, etc.
02:28:04 <not-fanboy[m]> Is it just me or does someone else gets random mesaages from copperhead as well?

02:29:29 <strcat> you can PM me them
02:29:30 <not-fanboy[m]> That just insane
02:29:50 <not-fanboy[m]> Okie let me some screenshots lol
02:30:25 <Jack8> When you are switching from another Android smartphone to Graphene, is it best to just install the apps and login or is there like a migration app to help?
02:30:53 <not-fanboy[m]> Can i post here?
02:31:00 <strcat> not-fanboy[m]: just PM me it
02:31:08 <not-fanboy[m]> Mhm
02:31:09 <strcat> don't post here
02:31:10 <not-fanboy[m]> Ok
02:34:27 <strcat> we're dealing with their attacks on the project daily, throughout the day, so it would be good if people could be understanding of that
02:34:46 <strcat> it is not a good time right now, they substantially escalated their attacks on us recently after we published the web installer
02:35:16 <Jack8> Ok no problem
02:35:17 <nicermen[m]> Attacks?
02:35:44 <strcat> responding to something prior
02:35:52 <nicermen[m]> What kind of attack?
02:36:14 <strcat> we've posted some examples on the subreddit
02:36:20 <IRCX6[m]> I have received messages from "sockpuppets" but that was along time ago on my sec acc but frgt the password
02:36:56 <IRCX6[m]>  just block them I guess
02:37:15 <nicermen[m]> I just got one lol
02:37:24 <strcat[m]> threats and intimidation of developers/contributors and developers on other projects
02:37:46 <strcat[m]> a misinformation campaign against the project, on a lot of platforms, and including reaching out to many people including our users/supporters and trying to trick them
02:38:27 <nicermen[m]> Let see what he wants from me 🤔
02:39:17 <strcat[m]> Matrix room is currently closed to new members, new people can join on IRC instead
02:39:27 <strcat[m]> not interested in another of their raids
02:40:04 <nicermen[m]> <strcat[m] "Matrix room is currently closed "> But they still adding other people from this chat
02:40:12 <bizanon[m]> jeez wtf is wrong with those ppl
02:40:33 <nicermen[m]> I think you should do a @ chat send a warning
02:40:44 <strcat[m]> nicermen: can you send me a screenshot
02:40:57 <strcat[m]> not here
02:41:00 <strcat[m]> in private message
02:41:02 <nicermen[m]> I didnt accept
02:41:13 <nicermen[m]> Sorry
02:41:19 <nicermen[m]> I got scary
02:41:24 <strcat[m]> tell me their account name at least
02:41:35 <nicermen[m]> Copperme
02:41:59 <nicermen[m]> Weird name lol
02:43:07 <nicermen[m]> Signal chat? 🤔
02:43:51 <nicermen[m]> Signal might be a better option for this
02:43:59 <strcat[m]> I invited you to a private chat
02:44:01 <strcat[m]> don't need Signal
02:44:31 <IRCX6[m]> <nicermen[m] "Signal might be a better option "> Its going to expose his phone number
02:44:42 <IRCX6[m]> That's not a good thing
02:44:56 <nicermen[m]> I was more talking about this chat to signal
02:45:04 <nicermen[m]> Cuz of the raids
02:45:07 <strcat[m]> that's not going to happen
02:45:16 <strcat[m]> and won't help
02:45:42 <strcat[m]> nicermen: you're a new person who just joined yourself
02:45:49 <nicermen[m]> Making a account in 10 sec with matrix wont help to
02:46:05 <nicermen[m]> <strcat[m] "nicermen: you're a new person wh"> Yes cuz the message
02:46:36 <IRCX6[m]> Everyone is gonna get Doxxed on signal
02:47:09 <IRCX6[m]> But I haven't checked if you can not show your phone number
02:48:20 <strcat[m]> we don't need advice on chat platforms for the project to use
02:49:26 <IRCX6[m]> Why are you unbanning them
02:49:38 <strcat[m]> freenode bans belong on freenode
02:49:41 <strcat[m]> don't need moderation advice
02:49:52 <IRCX6[m]> I'm asking
02:50:00 <IRCX6[m]> I'm not giving you advice
02:50:06 <nicermen[m]> Somone is a bit mad
02:50:38 <strcat[m]> people who newly joined the channel are considered highly likely of being sockpuppets used to pretend to be GrapheneOS users and spread drama
02:50:42 <strcat[m]> bans will be issued pretty quickly
02:50:46 <nicermen[m]> * Somone is a bit mad (good the way)
02:51:00 <strcat[m]> I recommend not trying getting involved in channel moderation if you're new and not a known, active user
02:51:00 <rny> we should just disconnect the matrix bridge already
02:51:01 <strcat[m]> thanks
02:51:10 <bizanon[m]> if you go on google with GOS, what does the website identify the device name as?
02:51:10 <bizanon[m]> https://myaccount.google.com/intro/device-activity
02:51:31 <IRCX6[m]> <strcat[m] "I recommend not trying getting i"> K
02:51:34 <nicermen[m]> What is Gos?
02:51:41 <rny> the signal-to-noise ratio from matrix users is approaching rock-bottom at this rate
02:51:43 <IRCX6[m]> GrapheneOS
02:51:43 <bizanon[m]> grapheneos
02:52:04 <nicermen[m]> Ok
02:52:17 <bizanon[m]> i meant, if you login to google with vanadium *
02:52:23 <bizanon[m]> im wondering how it shows up
02:52:38 <nicermen[m]> Try this ipleak . net
02:53:17 <nicermen[m]> There you find all what site can see about yoy
02:53:32 <nicermen[m]> * There you find all what the site can see about you
02:55:31 <zzxx123> Most people aren’t capable to learn to use IRC
02:55:53 <zzxx123> 80% of people in this chat are from Matrix
02:57:18 <bizanon[m]> <nicermen[m] "Try this ipleak . net"> this site did not identify any device information like pixel 5. Google device-activity some how has the ability to do that
02:57:31 <strcat> zzxx123: don't plan on dropping the bridge
02:57:38 <bizanon[m]> im just wondering if GOS/vanadium has a way around it
02:57:50 <strcat> just something to be aware of: nearly all the abuse happens via Matrix because it's much easier to create accounts and bypass bans
02:58:05 <strcat> so a typical response to that may be temporarily closing the room to new Matrix users
03:00:34 <zzxx123> Can substitute with a platform with higher registration  barrier like Telegram
03:02:04 <bizanon[m]> <nicermen[m] "There you find all what site can"> if u have a google acct, can you try loggin in to a random one and see the device-activity page? Im just curious if google can detect device name
03:02:57 <nicermen[m]> <bizanon[m] "im just wondering if GOS/vanadiu"> Bromite has a option for user agent
03:05:16 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so, with respect to device fingerprinting, Vanadium deliberately mimics the fingerprint of a stock pixel. This is by design and the reason why is because you don't want to be the one user that claims to be an [empty string], but that renders pages in the time that a Pixel would, completes instructions in the time a Pixel would, and renders webpages in the format way a Pixel would. This
03:05:17 <TheJollyRoger> would make it *extremely* obvious that you're lying about what device you are, and increase your uniqueness, making you stand out from the crowd.
03:05:25 <TheJollyRoger> It then becomes trivially obvious to track you over the internet.
03:05:41 <TheJollyRoger> The defaults in Vanadium are set taking this into account.
03:05:45 <TheJollyRoger> You should not change them.
03:05:59 <TheJollyRoger> Unless of course, you want to make yourself more unique on the internet.
03:06:20 <TheJollyRoger> *in the format of and the way
03:08:58 <bizanon[m]> thank you so much TheJollyRoger:
03:09:06 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: you're welcome!
03:09:24 <nicermen[m]> Or just tor browser for the most privscy
03:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> If I could give any advice to privacy enthusiasts trying to get onboard GrapheneOS, my most solid piece of advice is this:
03:09:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ditch power user mentality entirely.
03:10:39 <TheJollyRoger> The settings and options in GrapheneOS were made as part of a much bigger design decision to work in concert with each other as an entire package, with a clearly defined threat model. From your chair, all you're ever going to do if you want to countermand these design decisions, is actually make your instance of GrapheneOS *less* secure, and *less* private, NOT more.
03:10:51 <nicermen[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ditch power user mentality entir"> Fair point
03:11:26 <bizanon[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ok, so, with respect to device f"> is EVERYthing mimicing stock pixel 5? Theres gotta be SOME empty strings right? like sensor permissions etc
03:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Actually, GrapheneOS goes a bit further than you think on that:
03:11:43 <bizanon[m]> or am I thinking this incorrectly?
03:12:13 <TheJollyRoger> You are.
03:12:18 <bizanon[m]> I don't want to stand out. want to blend in
03:12:20 <strcat> bizanon[m]: yeah, you are, and you're confused about something which is that site shows devices logged in via Play services
03:12:37 <strcat> you're not getting any useful info from that
03:12:46 <bizanon[m]> oh ok I see
03:13:12 <TheJollyRoger> From the perspective of the site you're visiting on the other side, GrapheneOS should mimic the fingerprint of any ordinary Pixel of equivalent release and patch level, and anything that's not mimicked, is done so with a clear goal in mind:
03:13:13 <strcat> I don't think this is a good conversation for this channel especially right now
03:13:29 <strcat> I think I'm going to close the channel to new users overnight on the Matrix side
03:14:13 <Elementoshi[m]> What makes IRC more secure against ban evasion than Matrix?
03:14:28 <bizanon[m]> <strcat "I don't think this is a good con"> alrite my bad
03:14:44 <Elementoshi[m]> (ban evasion and abuse and whatnot)
03:15:01 <TheJollyRoger> for instance, battery level is actually stubbed out: rather than try to send falsified or randomized battery level, GrapheneOS chooses to stub out the battery indicator entirely and give the impression that the phone is plugged in, the battery is at 100%, and charging. Since that's a very good explanation as to why a battery indicator isn't changing, and it's also conditions you'd encounter in
03:15:02 <TheJollyRoger> the real world. Again, it's all for maximizing your potential anonymity set.
03:15:31 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: You're welcome to ask me in PM.
03:16:09 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh. Does that mean I can't see my battery percentage in GrapheneOS?
03:16:09 <bizanon[m]> can I pm you too/??
03:16:10 <nicermen[m]> Me too
03:16:46 <nicermen[m]> <Elementoshi[m] "Oh. Does that mean I can't see m"> You can
03:17:04 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: You can, it's in the upper right hand corner of your screen. It means *websites you visit and request your battery level* can't.
03:17:14 <Elementoshi[m]> Ohh cool
03:17:43 <TheJollyRoger> You guys can, although the more people messaging me, the slower I'll be able to get around to you guys.
03:18:16 <Elementoshi[m]> If I get a Pixel phone for GrapheneOS, I really hope it can be used for the usual stuff I do with my phone. Call people, chat on Signal, play mobile games (especially open source ones), etc
03:18:33 <MachX[m]> it can do all of those
03:18:43 <MachX> no worries
03:19:06 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: I can confirm SuperTuxKart works flawlessly on GrapheneOS.
03:19:17 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh cool
03:19:22 <Elementoshi[m]> And Mindustry too?
03:19:30 <MachX> yup ^ that works
03:19:46 <Elementoshi[m]> Speaking of which, very disappointed that the F-droid version of Mindustry seems to no longer be updated
03:19:46 <TheJollyRoger> Mindustry, I haven't tried. Signal works perfectly, but you must let it ignore battery optimization in order to properly display notifications.
03:20:15 <Jack8> What about Where's My Droid?
03:20:27 <Elementoshi[m]> Ooh, I'm gonna be mad if Orbot and the Tor Browser don't work. But I doubt they wouldn't.
03:20:44 <nicermen[m]> https://signal.org/android/apk/
03:20:55 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: Orbot and Tor Browser work fine.
03:20:57 <Elementoshi[m]> Where's My Droid? Is that a game, or a funny way to spell KDE Connect?
03:21:17 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: the long story short, any app that doesn't have a hard-coded dependency on Google Play Services will run on GrapheneOS.
03:21:25 <Jack8> Its an app that lets you locate your phone if its lost, wipe it, lock the screen, listen to the microphone, take pics with the camera etc
03:21:28 <nicermen[m]> There you can install apk without google play store service
03:21:33 <TheJollyRoger> So this means if the app hasn't been written to crash in the event that Google Play Services aren't present or are disabled on your phone, GrapheneOS will run it.
03:22:03 <TheJollyRoger> Jack8: It's very likely that that app won't work on GrapheneOS, since the app would need to be running in the foreground to do its work.
03:22:13 <TheJollyRoger> Something else I should stress:
03:22:55 <TheJollyRoger> There is a caveat to this: if I recall right we enforce a newer version of the Android API than the factory Pixel operating system.
03:23:24 <TheJollyRoger> So if you have older legacy apps that were compiled for an older version of Android, GrapheneOS will warn you about them, and in the future, the app authors *should* update their apps.
03:24:10 <Elementoshi[m]> Alternatives to Where's My Droid: https://alternativeto.net/software/wheres-my-droid/
03:24:30 <Elementoshi[m]> Prey looks like a possibly good alternative. Alternativeto says it's freemium but open source?
03:25:52 <Jack8> Thanks I'll check that out
03:26:32 <Jack8> I haven't lost my phone in 6 years lol but when I did, the GPS was turned off and I couldn't find it with GPS. So I learned that an app that can locate it anyway or turn GPS back on is useful.
03:28:45 <TheJollyRoger> So, I should take note here...
03:28:53 <TheJollyRoger> We don't recommend you install third party device administrators.
03:29:16 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, Google doesn't and device admininstrators are actually going to be depreciated soon. don't know when, but they've talked about it.
03:29:54 <nicermen[m]> Oh really?
03:30:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. They have a lot of attack surface and tend to be in positions of privilege on your phone. This is why Auditor lists them along with USB Debugging.
03:30:36 <nicermen[m]> Any sources?
03:30:43 <nicermen[m]> I love to read it
03:30:58 <nicermen[m]> * I will love to read it
03:31:07 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: the non-profile-owner / non-device-owner variants of them are deprecated
03:31:27 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: ah, got it.
03:31:40 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: one being provisioned as part of setup wizard to own the device, or one being the owner of a work profile
03:31:42 <strcat> is not deprecated
03:31:58 <strcat> but the stuff for using them to do arbitrary other stuff is deprecated
03:32:23 <TheJollyRoger> nicermen[m]: https://developers.google.com/android/work/device-admin-depreciation
03:32:48 <nicermen[m]> 404
03:32:57 <TheJollyRoger> Argh, looks like I might've copied that wrong, hango n.
03:33:11 <mr_hebi_san[m]> they deprecated their deprecation! :)
03:33:11 <nicermen[m]> I see
03:33:25 <TheJollyRoger> https://developers.google.com/android/work/device-admin-deprecation
03:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> My bad :P.
03:33:36 <nicermen[m]> Thats better, thnx
03:38:17 <Jack8> Yeah Prey and Where's My Droid say they wont work without Google Play Services
03:40:56 <nicermen[m]> This was on mind for little while  now but what happen to multitask?
03:41:25 <nicermen[m]> Since I cant find a option in settings
03:49:11 <strcat[m]> @room there is another Copperhead troll exploiting a Matrix / Element bug to impersonate myself and others in private messages, they're using a way to make another account name look like mine to promote CopperheadOS and are messaging people in the channel, it's not me
03:49:40 <Elementoshi[m]> Oof
03:49:45 <TheJollyRoger> Aaargh, dammit.
03:49:50 <Elementoshi[m]> I will remember that @strcat:matrix.org is official
03:50:03 <bizanon[m]> imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
03:50:09 <Jack8> Thats taking it a bit far to be so diabolical. Whats wrong with people?
03:50:11 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: they are using a bug to make it look like that
03:50:18 <strcat[m]> by adding a character not rendered by people's clients
03:50:18 <Elementoshi[m]> Ohhhhhh
03:50:20 <strcat[m]> be aware of that
03:50:21 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh crap
03:50:32 <strcat[m]> help welcome
03:50:32 <strcat[m]> trying to get in touch with Matrix admins atm
03:50:35 <Elementoshi[m]> Ohhhh, unicode
03:50:44 <strcat[m]> nah they seem to have added a .
03:50:51 <strcat[m]> which clients aren't rendering
03:50:52 <Elementoshi[m]> yeah maybe matrix IDs should be restricted to plaintext????? tf
03:51:00 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh
03:51:06 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh ok that's a bug
03:51:09 <MachX[m]> there's some glitch with periods lately
03:51:10 <IRCX6[m]> These CopperheadOs guys are CRAZY
03:51:33 <bizanon[m]> yaeh they are like psycho ex-girlfriend tier
03:51:44 <Elementoshi[m]> strcat: Maybe I could identify you by your device IDs?
03:53:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, really...
03:53:31 <bizanon[m]> <Jack8 "Yeah Prey and Where's My Droid s"> hey how do you know if app requires play services? Do you ahve to use trial and error or does it say somewhere before you download? I couldn't find it
03:54:12 <isavotoast[m]> could you guys just host your own homeserver for more control?
03:54:15 <Jack8> Its just when I tried to get to step 3/4 on the setup. Prey failed in a similar fashion and couldn't even show me my GPS coordinates
03:55:00 <bizanon[m]> ahh so trial and error
03:55:28 <Cushingar[m]> Every time I log on I find this channel has pinged me. I don't know what it is, but I want to fix it...
03:55:48 <mr_hebi_san[m]> There is one site I know of that is a community effort to listing what apps do and don't work, but the guy who maintains it is persona non grata around here for good reason
03:55:51 <strcat[m]> Cushingar: I pinged people because an exploit is being used
03:55:54 <strcat[m]> Cushingar: to target people in this room
03:56:03 <Cushingar[m]> <strcat[m] "Cushingar: to target people in t"> ah ok
03:56:07 <mr_hebi_san[m]> The app listing seems legit but I wouldn't use his site for anything else.
03:56:14 <strcat[m]> they are impersonating myself with a special character in the account name not rendered by clients
03:56:15 <strcat[m]> it's not me
03:56:22 <strcat[m]>  * they are impersonating me with a special character in the account name not rendered by clients
03:56:32 <strcat[m]> it looks like @strcat:matrix.org but isn't
03:56:36 <TheJollyRoger> It looks like it appears over IRC as well.
03:56:39 <strcat[m]> and they're contacting people going through the list of usernames
03:56:46 <TheJollyRoger> Er, it doesn't appear over IRC as well.
03:57:19 <bizanon[m]> I just got a PM
03:57:23 <TheJollyRoger> So it looks like strcat[m]1
03:57:23 <bizanon[m]> their website is cringe lol
03:57:42 <strcat[m]> this is very unfortunate
03:58:06 <IRCX6[m]> Some people might actually fall for this which is the sad part
03:58:34 <strcat[m]> btw would appreciate if people take screenshots of it
03:59:44 <bradgarlinghouse> In GrapheneOS, Is it possible to somehow create folders in the app menu?
03:59:56 <strcat[m]> bradgarlinghouse: you can create them on home screens
03:59:58 <take_a_deep_brea> yep
04:00:01 <strcat[m]> you should put all the apps you use on home screens
04:00:08 <strcat[m]> if you drag them on top of another icon you create a folder
04:00:19 <strcat[m]> need help getting in touch with a matrix admin
04:01:35 <bradgarlinghouse> <strcat[m] "you should put all the apps you "> So it's not possible to do it in the menu?
04:01:53 <strcat[m]> the app list is a list of apps
04:01:55 <strcat[m]> it's not customized
04:02:06 <strcat[m]> you take apps from there and put them on your home screens
04:02:16 <strcat[m]> that's what you customize with widgets, apps, folders
04:02:25 <strcat[m]> you can put every app from the app drawer there if you use them all
04:02:44 <strcat[m]> the app drawer is where you go to get the launcher icons to put on the home screen
04:03:51 <bradgarlinghouse> Alright, thank you for your answer.
04:03:51 <bradgarlinghouse> I'm just used to arrange all my apps in folders in the app menu itself and not on the homescreen, so just wanted to know 😊
04:07:56 <bizanon[m]> iau9we8ry98u3n sus

04:12:02 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> This is the impersonation stated recently
04:12:09 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <strcat[m] "they are impersonating myself wi"> ^^
04:12:14 <bradgarlinghouse> I guessed that.
04:12:24 <bradgarlinghouse> It's sad.
04:13:13 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Ooooh looks like I'm being pinged now by a strcat
04:13:51 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: Someone is impersonating him.
04:14:00 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <strcat[m] "@room there is another Copperhea"> Friendly reminder to be wary of impersonators
04:14:27 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mr_hebi_san: Someone is imperson"> Yep, rejected and ignored
04:16:25 <strcat[m]> @room a Copperhead troll has used a Matrix / Element bug to message everyone in the channel with an account that your client with wrongly display to be @strcat:matrix.org due to an exploit, it is FALSE INFORMATION from a malicious person, you should ideally reject the chat from them
04:17:55 <faxing[m]> I didn't get one
04:17:59 <faxing[m]> Fucked up, though.
04:18:43 <faxing[m]> Now I got one
04:18:48 <faxing[m]> second I messaged lmfao
04:21:35 <TheCookie[m]> Same for me, shall we provide screenshots?
04:21:43 <strcat> got screens already
04:21:47 <strcat> sorry about this
04:21:49 <strcat> :(
04:22:02 <bradgarlinghouse> You just know they are frauds, when they are using methods like this. Fuckers.
04:22:47 <rny> this is quite routine for popular projects
04:23:18 <skwisgaar[m]> Whoever wrote that message did a horrible job making it sound real...
04:23:38 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> "You have one job!"
04:23:42 <strcat> skwisgaar[m]: can't expect much from 10 euro / hour fiverr trolls
04:23:43 <TheJollyRoger> They've copied my "welcome aboard" gimmick too...
04:23:43 <IRCX6[m]> Lol yeah I got it too
04:23:46 <skwisgaar[m]> I expect nothing else than mediocrity from copperhead lol
04:23:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> bradgarlinghouse: I don't know if it's actually from C-head.  It could just be a particularly annoying troll who just knows how to push strcat's buttons.  Either way it's super pathetic
04:23:57 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Lmao, can't even promote their backdoored OS publicly
04:24:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Without slanders, misinformation and attacks
04:24:15 <strcat> mr_hebi_san[m]: they have a whole community of these trolls
04:24:21 <strcat> who they encourage to harass us
04:24:33 <strcat> Copperhead themselves doxxed me and I get threats
04:26:47 <skwisgaar[m]> To think they could have harassed any of the “security-oriented” projects out there, and they pick the one that actually has good security. Not too bright.
04:29:17 <rny> strcat: you should report to the police if they doxxed you
04:29:26 <rny> it should be criminal at this point
04:29:51 <TheCookie[m]> (Using Element Android) I can see the actual name in the rooms user list, which currently is ATstrcat.:matrix.org (as mentioned)
04:30:20 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <TheCookie[m] "(Using Element Android) I can se"> I can see the dot here too

04:31:00 <strcat[m]> rny: they doxxed me *by including my personal address in something they filed for publication by the government fraudulently claiming I had authorized it* so yeah
04:31:50 <strcat[m]> setting GrapheneOS logo as the avatar for my real account
04:32:05 <strcat[m]> ofc they could do that too
04:32:08 <strcat[m]> but maybe they have stopped now
04:46:57 <bizanon[m]> question:
04:46:57 <bizanon[m]> If I setup different IP per user account, Will each instance of vanadium create a unique fingerprint JS ? Using https://fingerprintjs.com/ as reference
04:47:14 <bizanon[m]> or will it not work because vanadium doesnt use javascript?
04:50:50 <strcat[m]> bizanon: every user on that device with GrapheneOS will have the same fingerprint, that's the goal
04:50:55 <strcat[m]>  * bizanon: every user on that device model with GrapheneOS will have the same fingerprint, that's the goal
04:56:01 <bizanon[m]> what about if you factory reset it,.can you change the fingerprint value thru that?
04:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> No.
04:56:33 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: remember that each instance of GrapheneOS is signed, verified, and bitwise identical.
04:57:35 <strcat[m]> bizanon: it's a browser fingerprint based on properties exposed by the browser
04:57:45 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have access to the OS and factory reset wouldn't be relevant anyway
04:59:17 <bizanon[m]> so the way to get a different value is to use a different browser

04:59:41 <IRCX6[m]> How do I beat this on Vanadium?
04:59:55 <IRCX6[m]> Browser Fingerprinting
05:00:33 <strcat[m]> IRCX6 (@ismellcap45:matrix.org): unclear what you mean
05:00:51 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: this topic has already been discussed: GrapheneOS and Vanadium were very carefully designed to blend in with stock pixel devices to maintain as much of an anonymity set as possible.
05:01:12 <TheJollyRoger> Anything you do, is likely to reduce or damage your anonymity set and make you stand out /even worse./
05:01:42 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: look at PM
05:02:00 <bizanon[m]> if fingerprint is identical from vanadium regardless of if you create new user ID,
05:02:00 <bizanon[m]> Is that the same with other browser like bromite?
05:02:00 <bizanon[m]> Like you have user 1 and user 2 both have bromite, will both produce the same fingerprint JS?
05:02:19 <strcat[m]> bromite is a different topic
05:02:27 <strcat[m]> Vanadium will be the same
05:03:04 <strcat[m]> bromite takes a different approach and it's off-topic for here
05:03:27 <bizanon[m]> alrite thank you

05:05:35 <strcat[m]> I just changed it again
05:05:42 <strcat[m]> to the auto-generated GitHub avatar
05:05:56 <strcat[m]> don't like using the project logo for my account
05:06:02 <pnrxa[m]1> Ah okay all good I was confused
05:06:22 <strcat[m]> deleted those messages
05:06:25 <strcat[m]> to avoid confusion
05:09:35 <PNDMT12345[m]> I heard that Waze would work well in de-googled phone. What are the pros and cons of using Waze on grapheneos?
05:10:17 <zzxx123> bizanon[m] if you have different system or browser settings, you will have slightly different fp, but you will likely still be identified as the same user.
05:10:52 <bizanon[m]> zzxx123: sorry what are you referring to? can you clarify?
05:11:31 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m] it means don't start messing with the settings in Vanadium if you want to maintain a large anonymity set.
05:11:38 <TheJollyRoger> Leave them as the defaults.
05:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise you start to stand out from the crowd and become more unique.
05:12:05 <zzxx123> > if fingerprint is identical from vanadium regardless of if you create new user ID,
05:13:49 <bizanon[m]> yes fingerprint like audio will be the same because its hardware based regardless of new user ID. I was asking about javasciprt fp and daniel said its the same and you are saying it wont be if you edit the settings slightly in user 2?
05:15:14 <mr_hebi_san[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Otherwise you start to stand out"> So then as I browse websites with unmodified Vanadium then these sites will come to believe that JollyRoger and I are the same?
05:15:47 <TheJollyRoger> mr_hebi_san[m]: If you're on a Pixel 4, you and I will both look the same, IP addresses notwithstanding.
05:16:06 <TheJollyRoger> Provided you and I haven't futzed with any of the settings in Vanadium.
05:16:09 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Not quite then, 4a.  But that is pretty funny :)
05:16:11 <strcat[m]> is anyone still being contacted by the troll using the exploit?
05:16:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I blocked the troll, and have not been contacted by any sock puppets
05:16:57 <bizanon[m]> <mr_hebi_san[m] "So then as I browse websites wit"> oh i actualy didn't know that.... so I'm actually blending in with the millions of other pixel 5 users...??
05:17:41 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Well then maybe I'll start using Vanadium more and get some people really interesting music suggestions :)
05:17:59 <strcat[m]> bizanon: kind of, there are differences that are visible via JS from Chrome/Chromium with Play services but basically Vanadium looks like a certain user config of Chrome/Chromium on a device without Play services
05:18:18 <strcat[m]> will get better soon when upstream enables a couple of the nice new features
05:18:26 <TheJollyRoger> bizanon[m]: Yes, that's the idea. GrapheneOS is designed to blend in.
05:18:32 <bizanon[m]> alrite thanks for the clarification !
05:21:45 <IRCX6[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mr_hebi_san: If you're on a Pixe"> If I want to avoid standing out should I leave my Browser Default Default like without no modifications
05:21:56 <TheJollyRoger> IRCX6[m]: yes.
05:21:59 <TheJollyRoger> No modifications.
05:22:35 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has already very carefully weighed the merits of those settings against the tradeoffs taking into account the big picture - other devices, the hardware, etc.
05:22:41 <TheJollyRoger> A complete threat model.
05:22:59 <TheJollyRoger> Use Vanadium as it is. If you don't want to save history, use incognito.
05:23:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
05:23:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not use incognito
05:23:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can be tracked on the basis of using incognito
05:24:11 <IRCX6[m]> I know this sound stupid I don't know about browser fingerprinting much but can I still modify these settings?

05:24:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> IRCX6 (@ismellcap45:matrix.org): please don't modify those
05:24:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Those settings should be same with all users so they can blend in
05:25:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Changing those will give you a unique fingerprint
05:25:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Those settings should be same for all users so they can blend in
05:25:13 <IRCX6[m]> Ahhhhh okay
05:25:42 <IRCX6[m]> Thanks anupritaisno1
05:25:58 <IRCX6[m]> And TheJollyRoger
05:26:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> GrapheneOS comes with sane security and privacy defaults out of the box
05:26:44 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I'll take my next question to off topic since it's about Bromite in realtion to Vanadium then
05:26:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is nothing that users need to change
05:26:59 <strcat[m]> IRCX6 (@ismellcap45:matrix.org): those aren't settings, that's how you clear browser data
05:27:29 <strcat[m]> IRCX6 (@ismellcap45:matrix.org): it's fine to clear browser data... although you could use Incognito to avoid creating it in the first place
05:27:33 <strcat[m]> not settings
05:27:43 <strcat[m]>  * those aren't not settings beyond selecting what to clear
05:27:47 <strcat[m]>  * those aren't settings beyond selecting what to clear
05:30:14 <bizanon[m]> does vanadium have its own 128bit or larger random value used as an identifier? and will other apps know what that value is?
05:31:39 <strcat[m]> no
05:31:50 <strcat[m]> bizanon: really don't know where you're getting these ideas
05:31:56 <strcat[m]> ok look
05:32:02 <strcat[m]> it's fairly obvious these accounts are connected
05:32:09 <strcat[m]> please use 1 account
05:32:13 <strcat[m]> for 1 person
05:35:12 <strcat> I'm likely going to need to set both of these channels to not accept new posts overnight due to the active raiding

08:52:00 <lovers6[m]> Hello to everyone
08:54:22 <lovers6[m]> I'm new to grapheneos, how do I disable ipv6?
09:00:23 <simpletech> On mobile data you search for "Access Point Name" and then "Edit access point" > "APN protocol".
09:00:37 <simpletech> On wifi I would do it via your router propably
09:00:51 <simpletech> why do you want to disable v6?
09:03:34 <jcb[m]> <lovers6[m] "I'm new to grapheneos, how do I "> Why would you do that?
09:04:06 <lovers6[m]> I want  to disable ipv6 to prevent all sort of leaks
09:04:20 <IRCX6[m]> Should I disable Ipv4 Connections on Orbit?
09:04:26 <IRCX6[m]> "Orbot"
09:04:31 <simpletech> IRCX6[m]: no
09:07:05 <IRCX6[m]> They should add a Ipv6 Connections only
09:07:21 <IRCX6[m]> "Ipv4"
09:07:31 <IRCX6[m]> * They should add a Ipv4 Connections only

09:40:56 <sigma_g> hi, is there a way to disable plain http in vanadium?
09:46:59 <miamgr63[m]> But sar values with graphene os are same with stock os? Maybe this is a stupid question, but I'm completely paranoid about radiation, I will stay on pixel 2 xl because sar values are lower than others pixel phones
09:48:52 <dazinism> sigma_g: don't think there is, but you get a warning if its http
09:49:36 <sigma_g> sad
09:57:08 <dazinism> lovers6: modifying user:config user.js makes the browser stand out / more unique / more easily to fingerprint

09:59:46 <sigma_g> hmm, I found about the policy "URLBlocklist". Now I just need to find how to get policies deployed :P
10:01:38 <dazinism> lovers6 vanadium is carefully set up to blend in, as much as possible, with the countless people using Chrome on the same phone
10:02:15 <dazinism> Its the path Tor Browser uses
10:03:00 <dazinism> Also Apple have been using successfully with Safari
10:03:48 <lovers6[m]> <dazinism "lovers6: modifying user:config u"> Arkenfox user.js  purpose is avoid fingerprint tracking
10:04:13 <dazinism> lovers6: yeah I know thats what they try to do
10:05:00 <dazinism> Just it isn't necessarily the best way to improve privacy / reduce the uniqueness of your fingerprint
10:05:41 <dazinism> Imagine how few people use that, compared to the huge number that don't
10:05:58 <dazinism> In the whole world
10:07:04 <dazinism> Just using that makes you somewhat unique.
10:08:02 <dazinism> If you don't want to be fingerprinted best bet is use unmodified Tor Browser
10:08:58 <dazinism> I put safety slider to safest, which does break some sites
10:09:19 <dazinism> But thats because Firefox browser isn't so secure

12:22:47 <madaidan[m]> Just because something emits radiation doesn't mean that it's harmful.
12:22:58 <madaidan[m]> Guess what visible light is? Radiation.
12:23:10 <madaidan[m]> And light is far more radioactive than your phone

14:48:54 <rwio[m]> I've been trying out GOS for some time now, and decided to switch over completely from my old phone. A problem however is that there are some crucial apps that are only available on Play Store. For most apps I can use FOSS or web versions, but for a few apps this isn't possible. What's the recommended approach to this? Using another profile specifically for these apps?
14:49:35 <youknowit[m]> <rwio[m] "I've been trying out GOS for som"> Aurora store
14:49:35 <strcat[m]> rwio: if they don't demand any scary permissions, no major issue with just using them
14:50:04 <strcat[m]> rwio: if they demand access to data in the profile you don't want to give them, then strongly consider using a user profile
14:50:18 <strcat[m]> rwio: if you don't trust them with the ability to communicate with other apps with mutual consent, you could also do that
14:50:24 <strcat[m]> but either way, they're equally sandboxed
14:51:52 <strcat[m]> johnmih: please send the screen in a direct message
14:51:56 <rwio[m]> Ok, thanks for the advice!
14:53:02 <doodern[m]> Does the dialer app support voip calling?
14:53:15 <strcat[m]> yes
14:53:20 <strcat[m]> and VoLTE is VOIP anyway
14:53:27 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend against using carrier-based calls/texts
14:53:31 <strcat[m]> avoid it whenever possible
14:53:35 <doodern[m]> Ah shit, great
14:53:39 <strcat[m]> doesn't matter how you access it, it's not a secure calling/texting network
14:54:00 <strcat[m]> VoLTE is just SIP via IMS
14:54:08 <doodern[m]> Oh
14:54:10 <strcat[m]> SMS for LTE and beyond is similarly just channeled via SIP/IMS
14:54:20 <strcat[m]> the Dialer app also has custom SIP support
14:54:54 <strcat[m]> johnmih: please send the screenshot if you aren't making it up, thanks
14:55:56 <doodern[m]> Thanks it gave me some ideas.

15:23:40 <strcat[m]> car0usel: there's no built-in email client
15:23:51 <strcat[m]> you have to install an email client like FairEmail, etc.
15:24:03 <strcat[m]> there's no built-in app which uses accounts
15:24:19 <pizzaeater69[m]> Do you currently need more people on 4a to join beta channel and report bugs etc?

15:43:56 <Ceavash> Hey friends. I cannot connect my Pixel 4a 5g to my win7 pc via USB. USB debugging is disabled and USB configuration is set to file transfer. I installed grapheneos successfully from my win10 laptop. When I connect the usb cable I hear my pc making noises of a USB connection, but I do not see it in the file explorer. Any ideas on what I am doing
15:43:57 <Ceavash> wrong?

15:45:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Ceavash, it sounds like you are doing everything right.
15:45:17 <TheJollyRoger> Not sure why it's not working for you there.
15:45:20 <neverfinished[m]> > <@neverfinished:matrix.org> That's why users shouldnot block and ads/tracks because they'd stand up, correct?
15:45:21 <neverfinished[m]>  * For my understanding, the best way would be using Vanadium with a VPN, that's alldazinism:
15:47:35 <Ceavash> TheJollyRoger I guess I feel less foolish. :)
15:48:13 <TheJollyRoger> Ceavash: Yarr, I'll go and check as well since an update just came today.
15:48:40 <Ceavash> Let me try and connect on my win10 laptop to at least isolate the problem
15:49:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ceavash: if it's any consolance, USB as a protocol is extremely complex, and support for it on some motherboards with some hardware (cables, motherboards), and firmware and software combinations can be extremely buggy.
15:49:30 <oiomo[m]> sha256
15:50:21 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, looks like Windows 10 and Pixel 4 work alright for me for Media Transfer Protocol.
15:51:14 <Ceavash> confirmed. Works just fine on my win10 pc. Thanks, TheJollyRoger
15:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ceavash: Yarr, glad to hear that!
15:52:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ceavash: I'm surprised you've still got a Windows 7 installation in service, the long-term support for Windows 7 ended last year.
15:52:24 <TheJollyRoger> Or even earlier, not sure which and time flies.
15:52:47 * TheJollyRoger checks.
15:53:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, whoop, looks like it was January 2020, so almost an even year.
15:53:50 <Ceavash> TheJollyRoger: Yeah. I'd prefer to not run win10 on this pc and been too busy/lazy to switch over to linux. I also have very non-technical folks use this pc.
15:54:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ceavash: Oh, I see. In that case, I think if Media Transfer Protocol won't work on that, you might try using a USB drive formatted as FAT to shuttle files between your phone and the PC, in interim.
15:56:14 <TheJollyRoger> You'll likely need to use the adapter that came with your phone. It sucks, but that's a temporary workaround.
15:57:48 <Ceavash> I just used my win10 to copy over what I needed. I appreciate your time, buddy, TheJollyRoger
15:58:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ceavash: Yarr, ye be welcome, glad to hear that you've found a fix!
16:07:11 <oiomo[m]> try checking the device manager and see if the device shows up the update drivers
16:12:17 <skagreek[m]> I can still return my 4a within the 30 days and get the 4a 5G ($449 at amazon). Anyone know if it's at least working, even with some bugs? Thanks.
16:12:52 <skagreek[m]> 4a has been rock solid :)
16:12:58 <Ceavash> oiomo[m]: I like this. I don't see it in the device manager. I'll compare the device manager on my working and non-working pc to try out further.
16:13:22 <Ceavash> At another time though. My device playtime is over. Thanks, friends.
16:14:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hello skagreek[m], Pixel 4a5G is now working and in full production.
16:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> *is now not only working, but it's reached full production status.
16:14:16 <skagreek[m]> OH AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
16:14:40 <skagreek[m]> thanks so much. Thanks to all the guys who work so hard on this project. It's been a life changer.
16:15:04 <TheJollyRoger> On behalf of the developers, ye be welcome! Glad to hear it's making a difference in your life!
16:15:50 <TheJollyRoger> skagreek[m]: If you can tolerate the occasional bug or feature breakage (none of which should compromise security, but may occasionally impact usability), please run the beta version, and report bugs, it greatly helps us out.
16:16:26 <skagreek[m]> Oh OK, yeah, I don't mind bugs. Been on stable for a month now with the 4a and it's been totally reliable.
16:16:51 <TheJollyRoger> We don't have telemetry in GrapheneOS, so we have no way of telling when new security mitigations cause features to break "in the wild" or crashes, so we need people writing back to tell us if new updates do or don't break the phone on the issue tracker.
16:17:42 <TheJollyRoger> Usually the window for beta report breakages is very narrow, sometimes as little as a handful of hours, so beta testers do need to be fairly committed to as soon as they get an update, to use their phone as quickly as they can and then reply "it's good" or "Something broke this update, here it is and here's how to reproduce the breakage."
16:17:57 <skagreek[m]> Definitely the best way to fix bugs, real life usage.
16:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
16:18:35 * hard_taffy[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tforHREIhIjwrrWpuopvSKMU/message.txt >
16:18:55 <TheJollyRoger> You won't have to change use habits, but I recommend trying to use as many features of your phone as possible during a beta test: take pictures, use the camera, use your apps, install/remove/update apps, transfer files, listen to music and watch movies on your phone, that sort of thing.
16:19:41 <TheJollyRoger> hard_taffy[m]: I'll send you my "NSA Social" writeup.
16:19:44 <TheJollyRoger> Sit tight a moment.
16:20:32 <skagreek[m]> I'm a fairly active user for sure.
16:22:17 <TheJollyRoger> hard_taffy[m]: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Peter-Easton/3af0af2d1c4c2eca24a9e324e0a22145/raw/80ce39ed46897fa328e3fcb983e133b1ed3d922f/NSA%2520Social%2520&%2520AndroMail This may help break it down a bit.
16:22:39 <TheJollyRoger> skagreek[m]: excellent!
16:23:03 <TheJollyRoger> You'd make a fine beta-tester, if you'd like to get reminders and updates, I've set up another chat room, let me dig up the link...
16:24:14 <TheJollyRoger> #freenode_#grapheneos-beta:matrix.org will get you into the Beta testing IRC channel if you are on Matrix.
16:24:19 <skagreek[m]> OK. Also saved that link to read later today.
16:24:37 <TheJollyRoger> This room's generally used for testing and reminders.
16:25:16 <skagreek[m]> Reporting main on github right?
16:25:19 <mr_hebi_san[m]> TheJollyRoger could you send me NSA Social too?
16:25:23 <TheJollyRoger> Great. It talks about a hypothesized scenario between a bunch of evil apps and a bunch of good apps are installed within and to different profiles.
16:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> skagreek[m]: Yeah, reporting errors is done on Github. I usually open the "Beta Test Results" thread, but anyone can.
16:26:11 <skagreek[m]> cool
16:26:14 <TheJollyRoger> So you don't have to wait for me to do it, if say I'm away from my desk or you beat me to it.
16:26:17 <TheJollyRoger> this is what they look like:
16:26:30 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/471 This is what it looks like.
16:27:18 <skagreek[m]> Excellent checklist!
16:28:10 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks! It's non exhaustive... it's not quite a structured form, it's just sort of something to let the developers know what I did and didn't test, I update it as things go.
16:28:40 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Aaah wait its the link you posted publicly :)
16:28:41 <TheJollyRoger> Occasionally if there's a specific update (such as last beta test, where a change was made to the way sound is handled on the phones), I get more specific, but generally this is how I go about testing a beta release.
16:29:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hey mr_hebi_san[m], yeah, it's above, I'm going to write it into a more coherent post sometime, when I have a bit more time.
16:29:50 <TheJollyRoger> So that way you won't have to slog through an incoherent and disjointed IRC log to get it.
16:30:10 <skagreek[m]> Saved the checklist as as well.
16:30:13 <nscnt[m]> RQ1A.210205.004.2021.02.26.16 is stable, isn't it? Am I missing something?
16:31:54 <TheJollyRoger> nscnt[m]: It went out for the Pixel 3s, I think the update for the Pixel 3s and 3XLs reverted the workaround for the cameras, but then I got it for the P4 last night.
16:32:11 <TheJollyRoger> So even though it is stable I still wanted to confirm for the other devices.
16:37:19 <dar_gomml[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nscnt: It went out for the Pixel"> got it too on the 4a today
16:38:42 <southwest[m]> Do you still need testing on the 3a's?
16:40:23 <TheJollyRoger> We'll always need testing, every release!
16:41:24 <southwest[m]> <TheJollyRoger "We'll always need testing, every"> K can you PM me the freenode link to beta notifications. I could not find it on matrix side.
16:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> southwest[m]: dar_gomml[m] it's #freenode_#grapheneos-beta:matrix.org
16:42:24 <southwest[m]> <TheJollyRoger "southwest: dar_gomml[m] it's #fr"> 👍
16:42:49 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That room is fairly small, I just use it for messaging out reminders and updates.
16:43:28 <southwest[m]> Perfect. Will try to help. Hard during the week but will do my best.
16:44:37 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Much appreciated!
16:45:34 <southwest[m]> What was the camera workaround if I may ask?
16:47:24 <TheJollyRoger> southwest[m]: I'm not sure, I think implementing slab canaries broke some camera functionality on the P3 and P3XL, so the developers had to work around that bug. It later got reverted, but that caused it to break again, so they added it back.
16:47:47 <TheJollyRoger> *the workaround for the bug later got removed, but that caused it to break again
16:47:58 <TheJollyRoger> So I think it's a bug exposed by some of the security hardening.
16:48:26 <TheJollyRoger> But I don't think the workaround is accessible from your chair.
16:48:47 <southwest[m]> K Thanks so the 3a does have the slab canaries?
16:49:46 <TheJollyRoger> I think they added it back.
16:50:02 <TheJollyRoger> But I don't think the 3a is affected by the camera bug.
16:51:28 <southwest[m]> This is way beyond my pay grade. Just wondering if its a time for a 4  😅.  Thanks.
16:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> It's an important exploit mitigation: they are used to detect memory corruption and mitigate exploits, so the security gains are big, it's great to have them working again. They were disabled for a short while last year due to diagnose a problem, then re-enabled. The workaround removed the update before last, then added back, if I recall right, although my memory's not great with these little
16:53:13 <TheJollyRoger> details, ha ha, yeah it's a bit beyond mine as well!
16:54:22 <TheJollyRoger> Your 3a will be good to go for until May of 2022, so if the need isn't pressing you right away, and the phone is still good, you can still definitely hang onto it!
16:55:07 <southwest[m]> Right on. Thanks again to you and the team!
16:55:11 <TheJollyRoger> The 4a and 5 will have a newer chip with a newer kernel, so they'll be slightly better in terms of security and exploit mitigations, but the gap between the generations of phones in terms of security properties has shrunk considerably each generation.
16:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! :)
16:58:11 <TheJollyRoger> The phones do use the same security chip. I'm hoping that the next generation of security chip will be designed with stuff they can open source more readily.
16:58:55 <kev5m[m]> hello
16:58:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
16:59:04 <kev5m[m]> Can I ask questions here? new to graphene
16:59:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, ye can.
16:59:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> Have you read the FAQ?
16:59:39 <kev5m[m]> just installed this thing on my pixel. I have questions about encryption.
17:00:00 <TheJollyRoger> There's a very detailed entry on the encryption and cipher on the phones at the FAQ.
17:00:17 * kev5m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sZBNAkWoNSjklfkuZmiPeuSy/message.txt >
17:00:34 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
17:00:52 <kev5m[m]> I asked this on reddit but the reddit is dead
17:00:52 <strcat[m]> kev5m: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
17:00:53 <strcat[m]> read information on the site before asking questions here
17:01:00 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: all three of those questions are answered in full there on the FAQ.
17:01:22 <kev5m[m]> alright thanks
17:01:24 <strcat[m]> kev5m: you seem to have a misunderstanding about how decryption works
17:01:35 <strcat[m]> it has hardware acceleration encryption/decryption and it decrypts data when it's read from storage
17:01:39 <kev5m[m]> hm
17:01:39 <strcat[m]> the data on storage is never decrypted there
17:01:41 <kev5m[m]> what do you mean
17:01:50 <strcat[m]> there is never a point that it decrypts data on storage
17:01:53 <strcat[m]> it's always decrypted there
17:02:21 <strcat[m]> providing your lock method derives encryption keys, it doesn't go and decrypt stuff on storage
17:02:26 <kev5m[m]> so attacker can hack it? if it's not encrypted
17:02:30 <strcat[m]> it obtains the keys needed to decrypt data
17:02:31 <strcat[m]> kev5m: no
17:02:33 <kev5m[m]> alright I'm gonna read that faq first.
17:02:43 <strcat[m]> kev5m: never said anything is not encrypted
17:02:46 <strcat[m]> you aren't reading my response
17:02:54 <TheJollyRoger> On your desktop, you're reliant on software encryption, which uses a key derivation function in software. This is why software encryption is so slow because it takes the "security by being computationally intensive" approach.
17:03:01 <kev5m[m]> 🤨
17:03:05 <strcat[m]> kev5m: please just read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
17:03:22 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't a problem on the Pixels because the Pixels have a purpose-designed solution for this.
17:03:31 <TheJollyRoger> More details are available in the FAQ.
17:03:34 <Elementoshi[m]> strcat: I think the way you're describing it sounds confusing AFAIK, the data is decrypted when you turn the phone on, it gets re-encrypted when you turn it off or reboot it.
17:03:42 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: no
17:03:45 <strcat[m]> that fundamentally is not how it works
17:03:58 <kev5m[m]> ok brb. going to read that first
17:04:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "it has hardware acceleration enc"> copenhagen_bram:  please read
17:04:07 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: at no point is plaintext written to the SSD.
17:04:37 <strcat[m]> all data is always encrypted on storage, it's never not encrypted, logging in does not make it decrypted, there is no process that happens of decrypting the data on storage, not how disk encryption works
17:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: if you're looking for a "worst case scenario" when someone steals your phone, a 4-digit pincode on a Pixel 3 or later running GrapheneOS would take 650 years to fully brute-force.
17:04:49 <strcat[m]> the data on storage is always entirely encrypted, every block is encrypted
17:04:52 <strcat[m]> always
17:04:58 <Elementoshi[m]> Ohh.
17:05:08 <strcat[m]> before you login, the OS does not have the key in memory to decrypt it
17:05:16 <strcat[m]> after you login, it has obtained the key to decrypt data in that profile as needed
17:05:30 <strcat[m]> it never decrypts data on storage, it reads the encrypted data and decrypts it with hardware acceleration
17:05:33 <strcat[m]> it has very little overhead
17:05:51 <kev5m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "kev5m: if you're looking for a ""> wow
17:05:51 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption covers how it works
17:06:10 <kev5m[m]> just like that? nothing else needed? just install graphene and set up a long pin? let's say 8 digits
17:06:16 <strcat[m]> kev5m: that's the secure element security, if you don't want to rely on the secure element then you do need a stronger passphrase
17:06:18 <kev5m[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/faq#encry"> is this a bot?
17:06:24 <strcat[m]> no
17:06:27 <Elementoshi[m]> How does it take 650 years to decrypt a 4 digit PIN number, if the speed of brute forcing is limited by the power of computation what if Google decides to brute force your phone?
17:06:29 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: imagine this: rather than have one big lock on your front door, which is the approach with Full Disk Encryption, imagine putting one lock on every door inside your house.
17:06:49 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption please
17:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: Because it doesn't work that way - it's limited by the timer within the security chip, which doesn't answer to the host clock.
17:06:58 <TheJollyRoger> All your questions are answered in the FAQ.
17:07:25 <strcat[m]> look: there has been a recent series of raids on our channels including attempts at concern trolling and wasting developer time
17:07:39 <strcat[m]> I'm going to be very quick to classify stuff as concern trolling
17:07:50 <strcat[m]> please be respectful of other people's time and read the information that's made available on the site
17:08:05 <Elementoshi[m]> Alright

17:10:24 <TheJollyRoger> To put it mildly.
17:10:36 <wrt[m]> Aha , that guy

17:11:21 <strcat[m]> the (@strcat:matrix.org) is added by the Element UI to disambiguate
17:11:32 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <TheJollyRoger "wrt: Someone has a personal vend"> Sadly, it's not only one person anymore
17:11:34 <strcat[m]> but someone can set their display name to `strcat (@strcat:matrix.org)` and it's displayed *the same way*
17:11:37 <strcat[m]> and that's what they were doing
17:11:43 <TheJollyRoger> DHFuchsiaOSwhen: Yeah...
17:11:47 <strcat[m]> and they were messaging tons of people in the channel pretending to be me
17:12:05 <strcat[m]> and I suspect some of the new accounts that are supposedly GrapheneOS users are the same person based on matching clients + time they were created
17:12:19 <MachX[m]> <TheJollyRoger "wrt: Someone has a personal vend"> as I've read on wikipedia, strcat used to work on Copperhead right?
17:12:35 <strcat[m]> MachX: Wikipedia is not an accurate source of information, Copperhead has been heavily editing it themselves
17:12:40 <Elementoshi[m]> If you click on someone's profile pic in Element, you can see their actual Matrix ID under their display name
17:12:40 <kev5m[m]> okay I don't understand sh*t lol
17:12:43 <strcat[m]> MachX: please don't get info on the situation there
17:13:00 <strcat[m]> kev5m: okay, data is always encrypted on storage, won't be able to explain it better here than it's explained there
17:13:02 <wrt[m]> Sorry to hear that dude.  Where can I donate? (Just to demonstrate that it is backfiring)
17:13:09 <TheJollyRoger> MachX[m]: Wikipedia has been repeatedly vandalized by Copperhead, they have been recruiting "volunteers" to edit it in their favour.
17:13:19 <strcat[m]> wrt: https://grapheneos.org/donate but we need other forms of help more than donations tbh
17:13:34 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: Now that you've read the FAQ, what parts do you want me to explain to you?
17:13:39 <wrt[m]> What do you need?
17:13:41 <strcat[m]> also please no one go further screw things up on Wikipedia by trying to naively edit it without following the rules, thanks
17:13:52 <Elementoshi[m]> For instance, you could click on my profile pic and see that my Matrix ID is @copenhagen_bram:matrix.org
17:14:02 <kev5m[m]> <strcat[m] "kev5m: okay, data is always encr"> I see. Need to read more
17:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> wrt[m]: We have a donation page available at https://grapheneos.org/donate - all proceeds go directly to the project.
17:14:43 <strcat[m]> kev5m: the website has a ton of info on it
17:14:43 <kev5m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "kev5m: Now that you've read the "> hold up I'm still chewing on it
17:14:44 <strcat[m]> kev5m: it could be split up into sections etc. but that's what it has atm
17:14:44 <kev5m[m]> maybe later
17:14:45 <MachX[m]> the copperhead guys are snakes then, as their name suggests
17:14:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
17:15:14 <carbonatom[m]> <MachX[m] "as I've read on wikipedia, strca"> https://mobile.twitter.com/DanielMicay check his Twitter to see what happened.
17:15:15 <MachX[m]> <TheJollyRoger "wrt: We have a donation page ava"> do you guys take stellar?
17:15:24 <Elementoshi[m]> So if I changed my display nick with for instance `/myroomnick strcat (@strcat:matrix.org)` you could click on my profile pic and see that I'm still actually @copenhagen_bram:matrix.org
17:15:45 <TheJollyRoger> Just Bitcoin and Monero, PayPal and Github Donations at the moment.
17:15:59 <wrt[m]> Just made a little donation
17:16:06 <Elementoshi[m]> I'm glad you guys accept monero :)
17:16:10 <TheJollyRoger> wrt[m]: On behalf of the project, thank you very much!
17:16:11 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Elementoshi[m] "So if I changed my display nick "> Yeah, the mere appearance of that nickname (and it being allowed) is a problem (on spoofing/impersonating)
17:16:19 <wrt[m]> Pleasure
17:16:43 <TheJollyRoger> I really appreciate it. This ship's kept sailing entirely by donations!
17:16:58 <TheJollyRoger-M> Test
17:17:13 <TheJollyRoger> Belay my last, just needed to see something on the other sidee
17:17:16 <TheJollyRoger> *side.
17:17:37 <kev5m[m]> can you just guys tell me what's the best way to set up pin/password/pattern
17:17:39 <Elementoshi[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "Yeah, the mere appearance of tha"> Yeah. I'm hoping it'll help a little if people know there's a way to check someone's real Matrix ID (And I hope I'm not wrong about that, and there  isn't a way to spoof the Matrix ID somehow)
17:17:39 <MachX[m]> JollyRoger:  Test Succeeded.
17:17:39 <kev5m[m]> so that it can't be brute forced only in a million years or something
17:17:42 <TheJollyRoger> Wow we are experiencing a lot of latency.
17:17:47 <kev5m[m]> 8 digit pin will do it?
17:18:24 <kev5m[m]> A secure internal timer is used to implement hardware-based delays for each attempt at key derivation
17:18:30 <kev5m[m]> oh. I see, this is interesting
17:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: Yes, on one condition: you generate that pin in a way that's difficult to guess. So it can't be something like your birthday or a personally significant date.
17:18:59 <kev5m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "kev5m: Yes, on one condition: yo"> yes of course.
17:19:58 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS permits long passphrases (up to 64 characters) to be used, so I like to use words rather than numbers since it's easier for me to remember "correct horse battery staple" rather than eg5tk7%29D$em!
17:20:36 <carbonatom[m]> I remember so many absolutely random passwords at this moment lol. I need to rethink my system so I just need to remember a few.
17:20:45 <carbonatom[m]> * I remember so many absolutely random passwords at this point lol. I need to rethink my system so I just need to remember a few.
17:20:49 <kev5m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "GrapheneOS permits long passphra"> kind of inconvenient to unlock phone each time with such passphrase when you need to use it
17:21:01 <wrt[m]> Yeah it’s got like haiku memorisation
17:22:08 <kev5m[m]> Can I set up so that if pin entered incorrect 5 times for example there's data wipe and reset of a phone
17:22:11 <Elementoshi[m]> <kev5m[m] "kind of inconvenient to unlock p"> I think pixel phones have either 3d face recognition or fingerprint scanner
17:22:13 <carbonatom[m]> <kev5m[m] "kind of inconvenient to unlock p"> You can set it up and use fingerprint. When you take your phone in a dangerous place, you can just enable lockdown mode and the fingerprint will be deactivated.
17:22:31 <carbonatom[m]> * You can set it up and use fingerprint. When you take your phone to a dangerous place, you can just enable lockdown mode and the fingerprint will be deactivated.
17:22:33 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: Yep, that's what the fingerprint sensor or facial recognition scanner is for. After you first switch your phone on, it will require the passphrase to unlock, after which you can unlock with biometrics like fingerprint or face. After which, you can use a combination of profiles (each of which are encrypted separately and may be logged out to eject the keys from memory) with a method of
17:22:34 <TheJollyRoger> your choosing
17:22:39 <Elementoshi[m]> Lockdown mode? That sounds cool. I wish my LineageOS phone had a lockdown mode
17:22:48 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: no, such methods of "nuke after X number of tries" are obsolete.
17:22:53 <kev5m[m]> <Elementoshi[m] "I think pixel phones have either"> that's not good. someone could use your fingerprint while you asleep
17:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: then use Lockdown.
17:23:18 <kev5m[m]> face recognition and finger scanner is not an option sorry
17:23:32 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why phones had "nuke after X number of incorrect attempts" are because older phones did not have a way to track time separately from the host clock.
17:23:37 <TheJollyRoger> So they just took the sledgehammer approach.
17:23:42 <eyeoftiger[m]> <take_a_deep_brea "please do not use lineage OS how"> take_a_deep_breath|mare:  wanted to check why not use LOS ? I did get a S20 and am debloating it. My main purpose is to keep ghoo-gle and all the politically motived tech companies away from my phone. I did remove many bloatware and ghoo-gle packages but there are many that are required for the phone to function. So why not use LOS ?
17:23:51 <dexlibre[m]> How do you guys image/backup your graphene device?
17:23:51 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: then you can use pincode and passphrase.
17:23:56 <Elementoshi[m]> <kev5m[m] "face recognition and finger scan"> then don't use them, you don't have to.
17:24:01 <kev5m[m]> <carbonatom[m] "You can set it up and use finger"> what's a lockdown mode
17:24:05 <TheJollyRoger> dexlibre[m]: GrapheneOS includes Seedvault
17:24:22 <TheJollyRoger> dexlibre[m]: go to Settings -> System -> Backup.
17:24:23 <carbonatom[m]> <Elementoshi[m] "Lockdown mode? That sounds cool."> I think it's an android feature, try searching lockdown in the settings.
17:24:29 <Elementoshi[m]> <kev5m[m] "what's a lockdown mode"> it's a mode that temporarily disables fingerprint or face recognition. So you could also use that before you go to sleep
17:24:59 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: kev5m[m] Lockdown is enabled by going to Settings -> Display -> Lock Screen and turning "Show lockdown option."
17:25:09 <Elementoshi[m]> I found it! Thanks!
17:25:19 <kev5m[m]> I just want a complete data wipe if pin is incorrect for example 6 times.
17:25:20 <TheJollyRoger> Then whenever you press and hold the Power key, there's a little icon that says "Lockdown" with a padlock icon.
17:25:32 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: That's theatrics and unsafe.
17:25:33 <kev5m[m]> I see.
17:25:52 <TheJollyRoger> kev5m[m]: even IF such an option would be done in GrapheneOS, it's still reliant on the security chip.
17:26:00 <TheJollyRoger> There would be no additional security gains for it.
17:26:10 <kev5m[m]> hmm
17:26:16 <TheJollyRoger> Old phones had it because they had no choice and no internal timer.
17:26:23 <TheJollyRoger> Even then, they didn't actually wipe the data.
17:26:26 <TheJollyRoger> They just reset the keys.
17:26:28 <Elementoshi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "kev5m: That's theatrics and unsa"> Why is it unsafe? Because anyone who wants to decrypt your data could just save their own copy of your encrypted data so that it can't be wiped
17:26:30 <TheJollyRoger> Again, theatrics.
17:26:42 <TheJollyRoger> Elementoshi[m]: Because then you raise potential for denial of service.
17:26:53 <kev5m[m]> <Elementoshi[m] "Why is it unsafe? Because anyone"> makes sense yeah
17:27:02 <Elementoshi[m]> That too. Anybody could just wipe your data for fun.
17:27:03 <carbonatom[m]> A bit off topic, but you can end secondary user session from long press power button -> end session.
17:27:14 <carbonatom[m]> Just found out myself lol
17:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> carbonatom[m]: Nonono that's perfectly on topic!
17:27:28 <TheJollyRoger> It's actually very good you brought that up, that's a feature exclusive to GrapheneOS.
17:27:49 <TheJollyRoger> If you're in a second profile and you hit "End Session" GrapheneOS will flush the keys for that profile and all its data out of the phone's memory.
17:28:10 <carbonatom[m]> It bugged me to have to lock and unlock the phone to end session. This feature makes this a lot easier.
17:28:47 <strcat[m]> carbonatom: on the lock screen you just push the button , don't need to unlock
17:28:54 <strcat[m]> but yeah you can do that too when it's not locked
17:28:59 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, it's a handy feature: if you're worried about someone attacking your phone while it's online, you can simply hit "end session" and that profile and all its data will be locked back down and the keys flushed out of memory until the password is entered again.
17:29:23 <TheJollyRoger> This allows you to keep the data contained in those  profiles safer by not having the keys to them in memory when the profile is not in use.
17:30:12 <carbonatom[m]> You can also hide the secondary profile by turning off "multiple users"
17:30:23 <carbonatom[m]> It becomes something like a hidden vault.
17:30:31 <carbonatom[m]> In a way
17:30:50 <strcat[m]> not rly hidden
17:31:07 <strcat[m]> there is not really any way to truly hide stuff like that
17:31:18 <strcat[m]> there are features pretending to provide that which... don't really work properly
17:31:22 * TheJollyRoger smells smoke.
17:31:28 * TheJollyRoger realizes he left the oven on.
17:31:31 <MachX[m]> strcat:  do you guys still use grsec?
17:31:33 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry shipmates, I will return soon.
17:31:39 <strcat[m]> MachX: it's not publicly available anymore
17:31:40 <Elementoshi[m]> The whole wikipedia article editing thing is kinda scary :/
17:31:46 <strcat[m]> MachX: so no
17:32:05 <strcat[m]> well as I said earlier, I don't want people here going to Wikipedia and trying to edit the article in a biased way, please don't do that, it will make things even worse
17:32:11 <strcat[m]> but please keep in mind companies pay people to edit their pages
17:32:11 <MachX[m]> https://github.com/anthraxx/linux-hardened
17:32:15 <MachX[m]> this one?
17:32:15 <strcat[m]> and Wikipedia is not a reliable source of info
17:32:22 <strcat[m]> MachX: that's not grsecurity
17:32:35 <MachX[m]> what I was asking is you guys made you own?
17:32:45 <strcat[m]> MachX: we use linux-hardened changes, yes, most of which we put together
17:32:52 <strcat[m]> it is not comparable to grsec
17:33:10 <MachX> ah I see
17:33:11 <MachX> thanks
17:33:16 <strcat[m]> Wikipedia is actually far worse than people realize, pls be aware that special interest groups and companies pay people to edit it
17:33:21 <Elementoshi[m]> How reliable is Wikipedia for non-GrapheneOS related things, such as pages about Einstein or WWII that aren't under attack?
17:33:26 <Elementoshi[m]> Oh, hmm
17:33:36 <MachX[m]> Some wikipedia articles like the one on black holes is really good
17:33:38 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: well those largely don't have special interest groups editing them because they are history
17:33:41 <Elementoshi[m]> Is there a more reliable source of info?
17:33:45 <take_a_deep_brea> copenhagen_bram:  why do we need wikipedia when you have the site and the documentation at hand ? well , but it is scary as we all use wikipedia as a trusted third party
17:33:47 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: yes, experts
17:33:48 <Elementoshi[m]> How do you define a reliable source of info?
17:33:50 <MachX> politically motivated ones however, are not trustable
17:34:14 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: content written by random anonymous people largely paid to edit pages to promote stuff or cover things up (for content with more modern relevance) is not a good source of info
17:34:33 <strcat[m]> people in US congress literally send their campaign ppl / interns to go edit their own pages
17:34:33 <strcat[m]> etc
17:34:43 <strcat[m]> how can you rely on that as a source of info? you're reading propaganda
17:34:52 <take_a_deep_brea> copenhagen_bram:  this is documented , that a wholse set of articles were written on a FICTIONAL WAR .
17:35:06 <dexlibre[m]> <TheJollyRoger "dexlibre: GrapheneOS includes Se"> Thanks!
17:35:09 <take_a_deep_brea> in wikipedia
17:35:33 <strcat[m]> also note Wikipedia does not really even attempt to provide accurate/true information but rather aims to provide info based on whatever secondary sources say
17:35:45 <strcat[m]> without an attempt at actually figuring out what's accurate
17:36:02 <strcat[m]> it's to a fair extent anti-expertise and anti-facts
17:36:23 <strcat[m]> for example they will strongly oppose citing things based on primary sources like actual source code, statistics/facts from official sources, etc.
17:36:23 <MachX[m]> there was an article which said "This article relies too much on PRIMARY sources" like how tf is that a bad thing
17:36:40 <strcat[m]> they only want to cover things through the interpretation of news media, etc.
17:36:43 <strcat[m]> that's the point of wikipedia
17:36:48 <strcat[m]> wikipedia is basically paraphrased news media
17:36:54 <MachX> pff5
17:37:00 <wrt[m]> Q which government depts use Copperhead?
17:37:05 <strcat[m]> wrt: none?
17:37:19 <MachX> all you need to know
17:37:20 <carbonatom[m]> You can always check the citations on wikipedia and judge for yourself
17:37:28 <MachX> is that the government is now watching you
17:37:34 <wrt[m]> So that's false advertising
17:37:35 <wrt[m]> In my country that is a crime
17:37:45 <Elementoshi[m]> <strcat[m] "for example they will strongly o"> wait wat wow
17:37:57 <kepoff[m]> quick question, my build does not include bootloader/radio img or the vendor img. What am I overlooking?
17:37:59 <MachX[m]> It's also a crime in my country, the United States, yet it is not well enforced
17:38:15 <wrt[m]> <MachX "is that the government is now wa"> Ha, is that meant to be intimidation?
17:38:18 <strcat[m]> kepoff: probably missed that step
17:38:26 <strcat[m]> kepoff: unless you built for generic target or another target without them
17:38:27 <take_a_deep_brea> wrt:  have you noticed that their site has brojen non existent links . its a defunct enterprise .
17:38:28 <MachX> was a joke :P
17:38:33 <strcat[m]> kepoff: not clear what you did
17:38:50 <strcat[m]> wrt: they've done a ton of false advertising and outright *fraud* in many different ways
17:38:53 <take_a_deep_brea> * wrt:  have you noticed that their site has broken/non existent links . its a defunct enterprise .
17:39:05 <strcat[m]> wrt: they make many fraudulent claims, and they stripped my name off my old blog posts, etc. to make it seem like they made them
17:39:11 <strcat[m]> wrt: they falsely claim to have made the code that we wrote
17:39:22 <strcat[m]> including code written after they tried their failed takeover attempt
17:39:25 <Elementoshi[m]> look what i found https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_not_a_reliable_source
17:39:28 <strcat[m]> they continue taking our work and fraudulently presenting it as their own
17:40:10 <wrt[m]> <MachX "was a joke :P"> Poe's Law...
17:40:50 <MachX[m]> <wrt[m] "Poe's Law..."> I don't see how that's Poe's law
17:41:04 <wrt[m]> <strcat[m] "they continue taking our work an"> How are LE able to help?
17:41:38 <strcat[m]> wrt: unsure what you mean, don't expect Canadian law enforcement to do anything, they do not care about stuff like this
17:42:34 <strcat[m]> it's not really helpful to try giving advice/suggestions without being familiar with the situation
17:42:34 <MachX[m]> the government is onto you is definitely a joke if some rando on the internet like me says it
17:44:25 <lagavulin16[m]> <MachX[m] "https://github.com/anthraxx/linu"> and now i am ready to take over the world 🤭
17:44:42 <wrt[m]> Not aware that I did, just a donation and a couple of questions.
17:45:09 <take_a_deep_brea> wrt:  he is just saying.
17:45:51 <take_a_deep_brea> from his point of view thats the thousandth time someone broached that topic with him
17:51:34 <jalb> I see all this time, when using 3-button navigation, that after an update it changes to 2-button, even saying it's using 3-button. I always must change to 2-button and to 3-button again :D
17:52:00 <jalb> It's not important but only to say: using 3.a
17:54:06 <carbonatom[m]> Happened to me too, I think a reboot resolved it.
17:56:59 <jalb> Only change in Gestures to 2-button and 3-button again, no problem
17:57:08 <jalb> No need to reboot
17:59:12 <jalb> What happens with grapheneos-offtopic, it says I'm banned, I don't enter there since the last time I asked and was answered by Daniel to some questions, no problem with me
17:59:36 <jalb> My last conversation was about Cloudfare there
18:01:42 <jalb> Well, no problem
18:02:23 <jalb> TheJollyRoger, do you know why'
18:02:27 <jalb> ?
18:03:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hi jalb, it looks like there is a ban on *adsl.inet-telecom.org due to someone using the VPN for abuse. I'll remove it.
18:03:29 <jalb> Ah ok TheJollyRoger thanks
18:03:37 <jalb> I always use a VPN, maybe it's that problem
18:03:49 <TheJollyRoger> jalb: try again now?
18:04:04 <jalb> Not working
18:04:36 <jalb> Anyway it was only to read the conversations there
18:06:42 <TheJollyRoger> Sec.
18:06:56 <TheJollyRoger> I think I found it.
18:08:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok jalb, give it a try now?
18:08:24 <TheJollyRoger> I think I found the entry and I removed it.
18:09:13 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like there were two entries in there.
18:09:18 <TheJollyRoger> Which overlapped.
18:45:24 <adeus[m]> What is the difference between using island or shelter or just using GrapheneOS option create new user ?
18:46:04 <adeus[m]> Has anyone here tested or deployed a MDM solution GrapheenOS phones. I tried zoho it was not ideal. Any other suggestions people have tested ?
18:48:45 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <adeus[m] "What is the difference between u"> You don't trust a third party app with a  permission that controls the user profile more than you (as this is how Mobile Device Management apps work between employers and employees) on an isolated storage, apps, contacts list, settings on AOSP's Multiple Users feature
18:50:49 <adeus[m]> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "You don't trust a third party ap"> I do need MDM features though.
18:51:23 <adeus[m]> It was two separate questions :)
18:51:26 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <DHFuchsiaOSwhen "You don't trust a third party ap"> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin
18:51:54 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> I mean it uses the same permission
18:52:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> "device admin" on making work profiles
18:52:07 <adeus[m]> I am setting up GrapheneOS devices for technically illiterate people. I need ability to remotely update software.
18:52:20 <adeus[m]> Remotely update or add/remove software.
18:52:51 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> That's for comparison of AOSP Multiple Users vs Island/Shelter Work Profiles
18:53:32 <strcat[m]> adeus: I do not really think people want someone with remote admin access to their phones...
18:53:52 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> For MDM app itself, I don't know of one that has good privacy and security practices
18:54:02 <strcat[m]> we don't currently provide a provisioning step in the SetupWizard for setting up an actual device owner device manager
18:54:07 <strcat[m]> and btw the purpose of that
18:54:14 <strcat[m]> is when someone other than the user owns the phone
18:54:31 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "is when someone other than the u"> Correct
18:54:31 <strcat[m]> there are device owners (must be setup when initially setting up the device) and profile owners (manage work profile)
18:54:53 <strcat[m]> and then standalone device management stuff which is just for remote wipe, locking, end session, etc. and most of the functionality was deprecated
18:55:33 <adeus[m]> I see. What would be options for me? I am trying to get few people on Graphene OS but I need have ability to remotely add, remove or update software on the phone or erase it.
18:55:35 <strcat[m]> so to actually overall control a device it's a device owner which must be setup during initial provisioning and we do not have integration for it in the setup wizard we have atm
18:55:36 <strcat[m]> can be set up via adb
18:55:57 <strcat[m]> adeus: do you own those phones?
18:56:02 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to be used that way if you don't
18:56:12 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "adeus: do you own those phones?"> Yes.
18:56:33 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Curious but what would happen to ported end session on GrapheneOS on userspace if those device admin features are depreciated?
18:56:55 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "can be set up via adb"> Any instructions on how to setup via adb?
18:57:24 <strcat[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: it won't be, what's deprecated is the standalone device manager that's not specifically a device or profile owner
18:57:37 <strcat[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: device management is not deprecated, all the functionality (far more than ever) is supported
18:57:55 <strcat[m]> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: but those device manager apps you enable in security settings to give them control over some things are basically deprecated
18:58:08 <strcat[m]> there are device owners (provisioned in initial setup) and profile owners
18:58:29 <strcat[m]> and then legacy style standalone device manager which isn't specifically one of those things
18:58:38 <strcat[m]> there is some non-deprecated stuff left for the standalone ones but most is deprecated
18:59:17 <adeus[m]> I signed up for a MDM service I had to via adb install an app it gave me full controlZ
18:59:42 <strcat[m]> yeah but that's adb, and sure, you can use adb to enable a device owner
18:59:50 <adeus[m]> Mmm
18:59:54 <strcat[m]> but the normal way to set it up is setup wizard integration which isn't present
18:59:58 <adeus[m]> I am not sure it enabled device owner it just sideloaded an app
19:00:05 <adeus[m]> Maybe it did I don’t know
19:00:24 <adeus[m]> No one here is setting up GrapheneOS devices for teams ? Any advice or tips how to manage simple functions (add, remove, update apps + remote wipe)? Is it possible to have these basic features without installing third party app?
19:00:57 <strcat[m]> there isn't a built in device manager
19:01:05 <strcat[m]> and it's pretty unlikely there would ever be one
19:01:19 <adeus[m]> I see
19:01:27 <strcat[m]> if we did make our own device manager it's unlikely we would bundle it as a system app
19:01:53 <strcat[m]> we could but it's not the type of thing we really plan to bundle
19:02:11 <strcat[m]> we're not trying to provide our own version of every app
19:02:13 <strcat[m]> and service
19:02:49 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense
19:02:49 <adeus[m]> I undersrsnd
19:02:50 <strcat[m]> if we made a device manager it'd probably use end-to-end encryption instead of trusting a server
19:02:51 <adeus[m]> I am just trying solve this basic problem though
19:02:51 <strcat[m]> I can't see us making a traditional device manager
19:02:52 <strcat[m]> adeus: so use an app
19:02:52 <strcat[m]> it's not a problem for the OS to solve
19:03:34 <strcat[m]> you can choose a device manager you want to use
19:03:34 <adeus[m]> Any suggestions ?
19:04:03 <strcat[m]> no, don't have any device managers to specifically recommend
19:04:06 <strcat[m]> there are plenty available
19:04:28 <adeus[m]> Thank you very much for helping
19:04:36 <adeus[m]> I will look around
19:04:40 <adeus[m]> 🙏
19:05:05 <strcat[m]> you need to look for a proper device owner one for what you want
19:05:12 <strcat[m]> not profile owner, not legacy standalone approach
19:07:07 <strcat[m]> adeus: https://developers.google.com/android/work/device-admin-deprecation
19:07:21 <strcat[m]> > Device admin has been considered a legacy management approach since Android’s managed device (device owner) and work profile (profile owner) modes were introduced in Android 5.0. Because device admin isn’t well suited to support today’s enterprise requirements, we recommend customers and partners adopt managed device and work profile modes to manage their devices from now on. To support this transition and focus
19:07:21 <strcat[m]> resources toward Android’s current management features, we deprecated device admin for enterprise use in the Android 9.0 release and we’ll remove these functions in the Android 10.0 release.
19:07:35 <strcat[m]> adeus: i.e. you are supposed to make it a managed device via device owner
19:07:50 <adeus[m]> I see
19:08:20 <adeus[m]> So I need find an app that supports putting the device in managed mode ?
19:10:20 <adeus[m]> Ok I found a list of mdm thet support “full device management”
19:11:26 <adeus[m]> If GrapheneOS does not have option to for example scan QR code to provision device for managed mode how am I expected be able to do this?
19:11:43 <strcat[m]> you aren't really expected to do it, you can make it work with adb but you'd have to know how
19:11:51 <strcat[m]> we haven't developed setup wizard support for it
19:12:41 <adeus[m]> 🤔 i see
19:13:27 <adeus[m]> https://www.manageengine.com/mobile-device-management-msp/help/android_for_work/mdm_device_owner_provisioning_adb.html
19:13:37 <adeus[m]> I did this ona GrapheneOS device
19:13:49 <adeus[m]> But it required an apk from mdm which was annoying
19:13:55 <adeus[m]> But it worked
19:14:06 <adeus[m]> But this is not full managed mode
19:15:41 <lazyfire> hey, sorry if the question does not fit here,
19:15:41 <lazyfire> will pixel 4a 5g get support in the future?
19:15:56 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> > <@lazyfire:matrix.org> hey, sorry if the question does not fit here,
19:15:57 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> > will pixel 4a 5g get support in the future?
19:15:57 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> It's already supported
19:16:06 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> grapheneos.org/releases
19:16:18 <lazyfire> oh wow!
19:17:15 <adeus[m]> https://www.manageengine.com/mobile-device-management-msp/help/index.html
19:17:15 <adeus[m]> I wonder if provision via NFC will work if I use a google device with NFC provision app to connect to GrapheneOS ?
19:17:17 <lazyfire> Degoogled, Hardened FuchsiaOS when?: thank you, gonna buy it
19:20:25 <adeus[m]> https://arsenb.wordpress.com/2021/01/26/enroll-a-fully-managed-non-gms-android-device-using-adb/
19:20:43 <adeus[m]> I think that is what mr cat was talking about
19:23:35 <madaidan[m]> mr cat
19:23:41 <adeus[m]> “Which is why the recommended way is for the device vendor to apply some effort and create a small piece of enrollment code for their own non-GMS Initial Setup Wizard.”
19:23:41 <adeus[m]> This option gets my vote 🔝🙋‍♀️🙏
19:24:28 <adeus[m]> I’ll keep at though and report back thank you for everyone help
19:34:49 <carbonatom[m]> <madaidan[m] "mr cat"> Lol
20:16:17 <grapheneos-tg-ma> This is a bridge account, please ignore any errors it spits out whilst we set it up.
21:17:58 <Elementoshi[m]> Lmao I can see the dot in the strcat impostor's Matrix ID when I click on their profile picture

21:22:53 <Elementoshi[m]> This is what the official strcat looks like when you click their profile picture, and they are definitely not interested in sending you a private message out of the blue:

22:28:35 <bizanon[m]> regarding apps being able to enumerate other apps, how will other apps see vanadaium as? what info will they obtain from vanadium app?
22:42:06 <timetravelingman> How do you think?
22:48:42 <fretegi> good afternoon!
22:48:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
22:48:56 <fretegi> ha love it
22:49:30 <fretegi> so just started using grapheneos, LOVE it! thanks.  couple little goofy things im hoping to find some best practices on
22:49:47 <TheJollyRoger> Glad to hear you're finding it useful!
22:49:52 <fretegi> lookin for a keyboard that allows switching to Japanese
22:49:59 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship, shipmate. What can we do for ye?
22:50:39 <carbonatom[m]> <bizanon[m] "regarding apps being able to enu"> Every app has their own sandbox, unless you intentionally grant it access to any kind of information, it's not gonna see it.
22:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ooh. That's a tricky one, I haven't got any knowledge on support for other languages yet. A few others here might be able to chime in though.
22:50:42 <fretegi> currently switching between the graphene one and open board, but cant find a language pack for open board or how to switch graphene
22:51:12 <fretegi> yea its a goofy one for sure ha, kk thanks
22:51:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, at this moment support for other languages on GrapheneOS is a tiny bit behind. Getting people we can trust is with the translation is the hard part at this moment.
22:51:43 <fretegi> yea i can imagine
22:52:33 <fretegi> how about getting apps from aurora? new to this whole concept of not using a google acct, does aurora kill off the benefits of grapheneos?
22:52:49 <fretegi> im sure very app dependent... but is there a sorta general thought on that?
22:53:31 <carbonatom[m]> Settings -> Languages & Input -> On Screen Keyboard -> GrapheneOS Keyboard -> Languages
22:53:33 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: at this moment, we've got a curated first-party app store on our roadmapp, but that's for the future. At the moment, Aurora is probably one of the safer ways to get your apps.
22:54:14 <fretegi> carbonatom[m], yup enabled japanese there, but cant seem to figure out how to switch the graphene keyboard itself
22:54:41 <carbonatom[m]> There should be a globe button next to the space bar
22:55:11 <TheJollyRoger> Under GrapheneOS keyboard settings, I can see a variety of other languages but... I don't see Japanese in the layout list.
22:55:52 <timetravelingman> Japanese text is invisible, so that makes sense
22:55:57 <carbonatom[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Under GrapheneOS keyboard settin"> It's a bunch of weird hieroglyphs
22:56:22 <carbonatom[m]> Try searching for Japanese in the search bar
22:56:29 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, oh no kidding, excellent news.  trying to move to oepn source replacements as much as possible
22:57:01 <TheJollyRoger> fretegi: with respect to "does it kill my benefits?" No, an app store doesn't destroy the benefits of GrapheneOS: apps on GrapheneOS are sandboxed, and it's a core goal of GrapheneOS to build upon, and improve upon, and strengthen the application sandboxing.
22:57:01 <fretegi> carbonatom[m], ah yes, didnt look there before, but dont see JA as an option
22:57:58 * carbonatom[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20210228_175747.jpg (11KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tOgyFpQVqznuVlUborpFfBLh/IMG_20210228_175747.jpg >
22:59:25 <TheJollyRoger> You can deny an app permissions, if you don't want it to do certain things like access your microphone, or your camera, or your location. Now that scoped storage enforcement is here, the apps are going to be restricted to specific folders in your storage, should they ask for permission to the shared storage.
23:00:04 <zzxx123> I don't think the AOSP keyboard supports inputing Japanese
23:00:07 <carbonatom[m]> Looks like it's available as an option but not available in the keyboard
23:00:12 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, darn.
23:00:22 <fretegi> carbonatom[m], interesting, so i have JA enabled under System > Languanges and input > Languages.  there i have english and Japanese.  however ksyboard itself does not have it
23:00:39 <fretegi> ah ok, so i didnt miss it.. dang it
23:00:43 <carbonatom[m]> fretegi: tested out myself, I see what you mean
23:00:56 <fretegi> any thoughts on a replacement keyboard that may?
23:01:06 <zzxx123> there are third party keyboard for japanese
23:01:09 <TheJollyRoger> I don't have any recommendations, unfortunately.
23:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> But I think some of the other members may.
23:02:15 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I use Mozc warmjuice
23:02:20 <fretegi> gotcha, thanks for checking guys
23:02:56 <mr_hebi_san[m]> It is on fdroid.  It's made by Google, and it has a network permission that I disable
23:02:59 <fretegi> so in reality, most apps from aurora should be theory safe due to the aggressive sandboxing grapheos does?
23:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so...
23:03:28 <fretegi> mr_hebi_san[m], interesting, looking now thanks
23:03:33 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Mozc for Android (Japanese Input Method Editor) - https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozc.android.inputmethod.japanese
23:04:54 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to denying network permission to the keyboard app, it's important to note that apps may still, within the same profile, can whitelist other apps they want to perform interprocess communication with. If those other apps also whitelist that app, they can communicate with them. This is a feature of Android and is actually required and expected for some apps to work.
23:05:13 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Gboard also has JP support, but for some reason Gboard isn't offering to auto-convert kana to kanji.  mozc doesn't have that problem
23:05:15 <TheJollyRoger> A keyboard app sits in a position of trust: that app is handling all your passwords, after all.
23:06:12 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS provides that keyboard app because it's safe. I'm not saying they do, but in theory, other keyboard apps could whitelist other apps for interprocess communication, and then exfiltrate data via another app they've whitelisted.
23:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> So it's prudent to be extremely careful of keyboard apps, even though the apps are all individually sandboxed.
23:07:32 <mr_hebi_san[m]> TheJollyRoger definely true.  Unfortunately I haven't found any better alternative for JP on graphene than what Google has made themselves.
23:07:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah..
23:08:29 <fretegi> mr_hebi_san[m], ahh got it, nice thanks!  is there a romanji setting for it that u know of? fiddling around with it as we speak
23:08:30 <zzxx123> That's the same for basically for other non latin languages
23:08:35 <TheJollyRoger> In the future, we have considered adding a permission toggle for inter-process communication, but that's something for the future.
23:08:43 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, excellent information thanks!
23:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
23:08:52 <mr_hebi_san[m]> My hope is that with no other google apps on the phone that other random apps wouldn't explicitly list Mozc and vice versa
23:09:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
23:11:00 <fretegi> mr_hebi_san[m], found it!
23:13:01 <skagreek[m]> I didn't get to read all these, but just a quick note. I used NetGuard and blocked Gboard for privacy. The only problem is, for voice to text it has to send data to google, so that part wont work.
23:16:04 <fretegi> gotcha good color thanks
23:16:25 <fretegi> will grpahene keyboard do voice to text?
23:16:54 <skagreek[m]> I didn't see it, but it's probably pretty involved without using google.
23:17:11 <fretegi> back of my mind was thinking the same
23:17:17 <mr_hebi_san[m]>  Well let's just crack open the Mozc apk and look at that AndroidManifest
23:18:30 <skagreek[m]> Need to learn about that.
23:19:34 <skagreek[m]> Oh I see, for Japanese.
23:20:14 <fretegi> well heck id be happy with voice to text on even english only ha
23:20:27 <skagreek[m]> Same here.
23:20:51 <fretegi> but... with all the other benefits of this OS, and how well it seems to run, ditching voice to text and google maps seems like a great tradeoff
23:21:02 <skagreek[m]> Wish there was a way to allow us to download the language pack and then block the gboard completely
23:21:40 <fretegi> ok how about casting to a chromecast... that doesnt seem to want to work
23:22:07 <skagreek[m]> I have ditched a lot of features for the great stuff graphene is offering. I come from the iOS world and android as well. There is NOTHING that is preventing me from going back to that crap. Graphene has been solid and working perfectly for almost everything I use daily.
23:22:47 <skagreek[m]> So far 1 month heavy daily user, and everything has been solid.
23:22:58 <fretegi> phone wont see my chromecast.  shouldnt be an issue with network settings on my part
23:23:00 <skagreek[m]> Yeah, the screencast is something I need for sure.
23:23:12 <skagreek[m]> I think they said it wasn't part of the OS for now.
23:23:44 <fretegi> 3 days here ha! BUT... been really digging into it and deeper and more thorough i get the more i love it
23:24:11 <fretegi> ok that explains it.. just simply couldnt find any devices... thats quite alright
23:24:16 <skagreek[m]> Yeah awesome to hear. Anything that I have trouble with by apps not working, I just make a shortcut on the homepage with a browser link.
23:24:59 <skagreek[m]> For example, Chase bank never worked, so I made a browser link.
23:25:33 <bizanon[m]> If I install GOS can I install stock pixel rom easily incase I need to go back?
23:25:50 <skagreek[m]> I did it back and forth like 50 times.
23:25:57 <bizanon[m]> Haha okay thanks
23:26:05 <skagreek[m]> same way to put gOS
23:26:41 <skagreek[m]> I haven't tried the web install yet, but I hear it's fairly easy.
23:28:15 <fretegi> web install is beyond easy
23:28:23 <fretegi> easier than the oem flash IMO
23:28:59 <fretegi> and yea i went from downgrading OEM >> ubuntu touch >> lineageos >> OEm again >> grapheneos
23:30:17 <skagreek[m]> HAHA, funny. Sounds like me. After a few times, it becomes so easy.
23:30:23 <fretegi> bizanon[m], grapheneos was the easiest of them all using the webinstaller
23:30:33 <skagreek[m]> can't wait to try it again.
23:30:43 <louipc> rom hopping huh
23:31:07 <skagreek[m]> Since the bars are all closed, I guess it beats bar hopping :)
23:31:14 <fretegi> yup, trying to find what works.. i have found it.. loving this grapheneos
23:31:25 <fretegi> oh there was a whiskey in hand the whole time tho!
23:31:33 <skagreek[m]> HAHA!
23:32:13 <skagreek[m]> Had to pack up and return my Pixel 4a today since I found out the 4a 5G works now. So I will be installing in a couple days again.
23:32:14 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, splice the mainbrace!
23:32:47 <skagreek[m]> Had to look that up. Navy term I guess. Good stuff!
23:32:59 <skagreek[m]> Learned something new today.
23:33:15 <skagreek[m]> You from the Burgh?
23:33:45 <fretegi> so last thing... theme'ing... my experience with droid has been limited to samsung stuff until now..  bought this pixel just for this infact.. any way to add more coprehensive "theme'ing".  or even like adding one ui or something? im gonna get asked it by those i try to convert to this ha
23:34:01 <fretegi> all this navy and pirate jargon making me want to pour a rum...
23:34:33 <skagreek[m]> My cousin is an iOS guy too, and he can't wait to jump on board.
23:34:49 <skagreek[m]> Was easy to convert him.
23:35:38 <skagreek[m]> Gotta take off. Such a great place to chat here. Thanks all for the great info!
23:36:02 <fretegi> nice to meet ya, cheers!
23:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
23:44:24 <fretegi> TheJollyRoger, any thoughts on added theme'ing capabilites?
23:44:49 <mr_hebi_san[m]> TheJollyRoger: Remind me again the keywords in an Android Manifest I'd need to look for to verify which other apps a given app thinks it's cool to trade data with?
23:45:00 <mr_hebi_san[m]> I've got the Mozc manifest open right now
23:45:20 <fretegi> im happy with this thing as is... BUT., trying to convert a few folks and expand our community, they gonna ask
23:56:37 <mr_hebi_san[m]> Thusfar nothing in the manifest appears to be an external application.  I'm not other people but nothing in it screams that Google's mozc keyboard is going to exfiltrate to any other apps
23:56:50 <mr_hebi_san[m]> YMMV if you look yourself
