00:11:09 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> What's this? Tor blocks it.
00:13:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> A demonstration of the advanced security measures implemented in the ultra secure messenger known as brax.me
00:13:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> based
00:14:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Blocked by NoScript.
00:14:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Don't seem good.
00:14:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> Lmao
00:15:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I use Tor btw
00:15:07 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <m​adaidan> It's doing its job well then
00:15:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> noscript is too based for the security features of brax.me
00:15:49 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> goes into Chromium
00:17:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> g​ochoingles shared a file (video/mp4) on Telegram with title: 'mp4.mp4'.
00:29:24 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> So what's wrong with Brax.me again?
00:29:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> it comes with too much security 😎
00:31:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Not sure if that's sarcasm or not.
00:32:06 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> It is.
00:32:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> You can easily compromise brax.me by writing some extra stuff on the URL
00:33:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> brax.me is vulnerable to xss lol
00:35:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> That's not good
00:36:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Have you guys checked out his channel?  Has a lot of content privacy.
00:36:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Is it any good?
00:39:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> I very much doubt it.
00:39:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Privacy =/= security.
00:42:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> no
00:45:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Gotcha
00:45:37 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Thanks
00:50:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> What about 'The Hated One'?  Is that credible?
00:51:57 <polardroid> he has a decent ytube channel
00:52:21 <polardroid> plus anything you can learn about privacy, can't hurt
00:55:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> Besides the GOS website, can you recommend other links for good reading/learning about security & privacy?
00:57:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!user> So far I've seen Rob Braxman, The Hated One, & Techlore to try and learn a bit more.  It seems to always be a moving target given how fast tech advances.
00:59:46 <polardroid> along those lines "twit" Steve Gibson, who is "older" than those guys but been it the trade a long time
01:02:39 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend finding better sources of information than clueless YouTube influencers
01:03:01 <strcat[m]> this conversation doesn't belong in this channel, there's #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
01:03:04 <strcat[m]> it's not appropriate here
01:03:24 <polardroid> Gibson has been around since before youtube
01:03:37 <strcat[m]> and is a charlatan / scammer
01:03:39 <polardroid> yeah its not really graphene topic agree
01:06:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Techlore is no good.

01:36:02 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you for the upgrade, strcat[m].
02:22:13 <Wonderfall[m]> Thank you very much.
02:47:27 <strcat[m]> servers also updated to nginx 1.20.0, shouldn't cause any issues, had to deal with minor configuration changes
02:49:12 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome!
02:49:35 <dnull> Nice
04:56:02 <th0rr[m]> I have a question, why does this boy in his video disable the Vanadium browser (which refers to anonymity and innocence)? Is he not attacking GrapheneOS? I find it strange to pass as an example of a browser that you have specially reworked for the needs of the system.
04:56:02 <th0rr[m]> https://youtu.be/dMWEym0KPcA
04:56:02 <th0rr[m]> 07:55
05:05:07 <abff> isn't techlore canonically trash content
05:06:23 <mefistofeles> it has some nice content, imho
05:06:37 <mefistofeles> now, that attack on grapheneOS isn't one
05:08:26 <abff> I mean like I get it, fuck chromiun, but lets be real theres no way to avoid it unless you run surf or some other terminal browser
05:09:28 <abff> I'm not gonna watch a 20 minute video, but th0rr[m] what (likely also suspect) webview did he recommend
05:10:04 <akc3n[m]> th0rr: techlore is NFG.
05:10:04 <akc3n[m]> https://nitter.eu/GrapheneOS/status/1378167192169160706
05:11:59 <TheJollyRoger> th0rr[m]: It's not recommended to disable Vanadium browser in GrapheneOS; Vanadium is the only browser that takes advantage of GrapheneOS' internal sandboxing and improved memory safety and has been designed to work in conjunction with the improved security measures and exploit mitigations that is a central goal of GrapheneOS.
05:12:38 <akc3n[m]> BTW guys, this maybe suited better for the offtopic room/channel perhaps. ( #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org on matrix or #grapheneos-offtopic on irc ). But also
05:13:00 <akc3n[m]> * BTW guys, this maybe suited better for the offtopic room/channel perhaps. ( #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org on matrix or #grapheneos-offtopic on irc ).
05:14:03 <TheJollyRoger> It's very likely that people who are trying to disable Vanadium on GrapheneOS don't understand or don't realize what the project's goals are or don't appreciate the improvements in memory safety to mitigate exploits and prevent them from turning into vulnerabilities, nor do they understand that Vanadium has been very carefully designed to mimic the exact browser fingerprint of a stock device
05:14:05 <TheJollyRoger> running the factory Android build, in order to maximize your anonymity set when using GrapheneOS.
05:15:08 <TheJollyRoger> I think this may be the third time I've said this old wisecrack, but it bears repeating:
05:15:16 <TheJollyRoger> "Where do you hide an elephant?"
05:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> The answer is:
05:15:21 <TheJollyRoger> "Inside a herd of elephants."
05:16:05 <TheJollyRoger> That's the approach that GrapheneOS has taken, and it's a very pragmatic one because a browser is a very complex state machine; not sending information that it should, is indeed sending information that makes you distinct from the norm, and reduces your anonymity set, sometimes very rapidly.
05:17:31 <somenerd[m]> It also has a bunch of privacy improvements (removing sensors access to websites, for example)
05:17:42 <TheJollyRoger> th0rr[m]: the defaults, and default apps included in GrapheneOS were very deliberately picked, taking into account a specific design and threat model, and are intended to work in concert with one another.
05:17:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:17:53 <akc3n[m]> <TheJollyRoger ""Inside a herd of elephants.""> security through obscurity?
05:18:23 <abff> akc3n: not really, anonymity and security are different problems
05:18:48 <TheJollyRoger> akc3n[m]: Hmm, I wouldn't say so, I think it's more a matter of "anonymity through homogenity."
05:19:26 <akc3n[m]> Ahh gotcha. I'll have to read up on it now, I misunderstood it. Thought of it as something else entirely when I read about ages ago. Thanks for correcting me.
05:19:46 <TheJollyRoger> th0rr[m]: so, when people countermand those decisions out of a sense of "because I know better" that's the stuff that toxic power user mentality is made of and this kind of hubris is what tends to get people screwed.
05:20:00 <somenerd[m]> The fingerprinting resistance doesn’t affect security either way
05:22:00 <TheJollyRoger> I find it very disappointing that other people are choosing to dispense bad advice without understanding the reasoning for why things are done they way they are done on GrapheneOS, or its design and its principles.
05:22:19 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, misspelled "homogeneity."
05:22:30 <akc3n[m]> Ahh here we, https://teddit.net/r/GrapheneOS/comments/flazp0/vanadium_privacy_question/fkyi436?context=3
05:22:30 <akc3n[m]> I got confused about what STO meant.
05:24:37 <somenerd[m]> >I find it very disappointing that other people are choosing to dispense bad advice without understanding the reasoning for why things are done they way they are done on GrapheneOS, or its design and its principles.
05:24:37 <somenerd[m]> and also sometimes misunderstanding the purpose of GrapheneOS
05:24:44 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:24:45 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> From the perspective of browser separation for privacy, would it be better then to just use vanadium for everything?
05:24:46 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> I've been using different browsers for different categories of tasks, like vanadium for permanent logins, DDG for tabs I don't log in to but keep for some time, Firefox focus for opening links like Google amp, or shortened links which could go anywhere.
05:24:46 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> Would just vanadium be better for all then?
05:25:50 <TheJollyRoger> rahoonGOAWAY[m]: Yes. A core tenement of Vanadium is to isolate the sites from each other. You can use Incognito if you want to avoid storing information and drag an "Incognito" widget onto your homescreen.
05:26:01 <akc3n[m]> Rahoon GOAWAY: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
05:26:45 <TheJollyRoger> Although Bromite has worked with GrapheneOS in the past, I'd wholeheartedly suggest avoiding gecko-based browsers, since Firefox does not internally sandbox on Android, and has an "All your eggs in one basket" approach.
05:27:02 <th0rr[m]> <TheJollyRoger "th0rr: It's not recommended to d"> I trust GrapheneOS, it is logical that I do not doubt. Thank you for the response.
05:27:20 <TheJollyRoger> th0rr[m]: You're welcome! Anything else I might be able to answer for you?
05:27:39 <abff> I really think every browser needs umatrix like granular control built in
05:27:48 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Although Bromite has worked with"> Ye but there's never more than 1-2 tabs upon at a timein you for me. And it wipes between each session
05:28:14 <abff> does vanadium have any plans on recreating a umatrix type of filtering?
05:28:18 <rahoonGOAWAY[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Rahoon GOAWAY: Yes. A core tenem"> Ok thanks!
05:28:42 <somenerd[m]> >does vanadium have any plans on recreating a umatrix type of filtering?
05:28:42 <somenerd[m]> No, I don’t think so
05:28:57 <jandroid[m]> One more try- anyone knows how to disable RTT on the dialer?  In the dialer on stock Android, I can hide it.  Settings -> Accessibility -> RTT. That option isn't available in the dialer in Graphene OS
05:28:58 <abff> TheJollyRoger: and firefox codebase has consistently become more and more chrome based over the years. moz is dead tbh
05:29:08 <abff> somenerd[m]: depressing honestly
05:29:09 <TheJollyRoger> abff: So, with respect to blocking and enumerating badness, Vanadium deliberately doesn't try to block ads because ad blocking is the best way to make yourself trivially trackable online via blocked domain enumeration.
05:29:34 <somenerd[m]> It won’t solve any privacy or security problems
05:29:52 <TheJollyRoger> abff: Yeah, it is depressing to see less diversity in the ecosystem.
05:30:08 <th0rr[m]> <TheJollyRoger "th0rr: You're welcome! Anything "> The final question about browsing security, active sessions logged in the browser ... so always use the default Vanadium?
05:30:40 <abff> TheJollyRoger: that argument is one of the reasons I try to actively avoid big data sinkholes like crimeflare
05:30:53 <TheJollyRoger> A simple, if somewhat inelegant way to do tracking via blocked domains, is to include a one pixel image hosted on every single advertising domain you can think of, on a background of the same colour, and then see what browsers load the images, and then enumerating which combinations go where.
05:31:05 <TheJollyRoger> This is an approach that can be done without needing javascript, and it works in HTML.
05:31:21 <somenerd[m]> Maybe WebKit can help?
05:31:25 <TheJollyRoger> It's inelegant and it's very kludgy, but this would actually work quite well and it's very programmatically simple. This is why we don't block ads in Vanadium.
05:31:29 <somenerd[m]> offtopic convo though
05:31:48 <abff> TheJollyRoger: that's the og tracker cookie lol I remember learning about those like 15 years ago
05:32:10 <TheJollyRoger> abff: Yes! And because most people heavily personalize their block lists, it works great on getting each individual browser.
05:32:23 <abff> somenerd[m]: not really, we're discussing vanadium and it's performance
05:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> th0rr[m]: Yes, never tune the configuration in Vanadium. They're set so that you can blend into the crowd.
05:33:29 <somenerd[m]> >somenerd: not really, we're discussing vanadium and it's performance
05:33:30 <somenerd[m]> I’m talking about my message (about WebKit)
05:33:40 <TheJollyRoger> jandroid[m]: Sorry, I've never messed with that, hopefully someone more knowledgeable than I can comment on that for you.
05:34:06 <abff> I wonder if you could instead of ignoring 3rd party plants by streaming them directly to /dev/null instead reroute them in a tiny vm sandbox and make it look like you're just idling on the page
05:34:49 <th0rr[m]> TheJollyRoger: Thank's bro 👊
05:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> th0rr[m]: You're welcome!
05:36:32 <abff> TheJollyRoger: as for ad blocking I usually do it exclusively with ublock origin and just delete the frame client side manually
05:36:49 <abff> afaiu they are still there just unrendered
05:37:07 <abff> or I guess they don't use frames anymore they use div tags
05:37:50 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I'm not the most knowledgeable about this sort of thing, to be honest.
05:38:13 <abff> umatrix is more like "ah yes I want this cdn but I don't want stripe or this yandex spyware etc etc"
05:40:16 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, well that sort of thing, while it would be nice isn't something I'd ever see Vanadium adopting, since again it'd be very easy to enumerate blocked content and use that for fingerprinting. I know this kinda sucks to hear, but I think if something was to be done about it, it'd be best to send that upstream, try and get it adopted upstream, and then that would make it into Vanadium.
05:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> It would be nice, no argument there! But I don't see Vanadium adopting it unless the changes were merged upstream.
05:41:19 <somenerd[m]> I’m not sure if upstream would like it either tbh
05:41:23 <abff> yeah chromium decendents are very user hostile in this area
05:41:42 <abff> that includes firefox in my mind
05:42:42 <abff> the umatrix extension was abandoned over a year ago, it still works kind of, but now google and moz are making very concerted efforts to deny self installed extensions on mobile devices
05:43:13 <abff> there exists a fork for palemoon but that whole situation is another pandoras box
05:44:26 <abff> I'm about ready to never fuck with clearweb https ever again if I can help it
05:47:18 <abff> unless I can do it from the comfort of a specially designed api and not have to be in a chromium browser including electron (cr)apps
06:43:41 <helloworldkk87[m> Do you have a way to explain this in more simple way: "update our change to use max ASLR entropy before the init process enables it for the larger address space enabled by GrapheneOS"
07:28:32 <Xatian> Hello, I am using grapheneos for a few days now and I got an "issue" with the keyboard. I have to write in a different language from time to time so I added the additional language to the keyboard. Now I can swap to a different layout when the keyboard is shown, but the dictionary is not changed and therefore everything I write is highlighted in
07:28:33 <Xatian> red. When changing the system-language the dictionary-language is changed automatically/correctly, but just changing the layout on the keyboard does not seem to affect the dictionary-language. Am I doing something wrong, is this a bug or the way it is supposed to be? Thank you!
08:00:07 <Exilion[m]> Not sure, but try to add multiple system languages
08:01:33 <Exilion[m]> I'm using different keyboard and spellchecker
08:14:16 <Xatian> I did but still everything I write in the second language is underlined in red. I found a different menu @ language and input -> advanced -> tools -> spell checker -> languages where I can change between "system language" or one particular language. So I guess this a android thing --> that there can be only one active spell-checked language and
08:14:17 <Xatian> changing the keyboard-layout does not also change the language of the spell-checker. If that is the case it is fine ... I am new android user ;-)   so I thought maybe I overlooked something.

10:18:08 <Anders> Hi, my device have an owner account and an profile NR1. NR1 uses orbot for all connections. When I add a wi-fi network to NR1 and switch over to the owner profile It automatically connects to the network without me ever entered the password. Do the connection go through orbot as well? even orbot is not installed on the owner profile?
10:20:08 <Anders> forgot to mention that profile NR1 has always on VPN activated
10:24:26 <Pratyush[m]> Afaik, connection details got shared like wifi password and connection but vpn is profile saprate.
10:24:26 <Pratyush[m]> So vpn in profile/user account A will not effect any Network in owner or other profile.

10:58:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> virtualcat[m]: hello, read this https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
10:58:37 <hypokeimenon[m]> virtualcat  No. Graphene OS supports a few devices that meet the requirements for baseline security features. Unfortunately, the Oneplus 7 Pro is not one of them.
10:58:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> See Hulk's link for more info.
11:01:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> anupritaisno1 has looked into some Oneplus devices extensively though, so it may be worth seeing if you can get in contact with them when they are free.
11:01:29 <hypokeimenon[m]> You will not be able to get Graphene OS, but you may have other options if you do not want to stay on the stock/pre-installed OS.
11:07:11 <covid-1984[m]> anupritaisno1: what's their alternative to the Titan M in order to stop brute force attacks?
11:07:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> AFAIK, there is none

11:08:09 <covid-1984[m]> Right, seems important if it wants to compete
12:20:07 <Ed[m]2> Just tested grapheneos external keyboard support, and its phenomenal.
12:20:27 <Ed[m]2> i dont think ive ever had a keyboard work as well as this on a phone
12:32:32 <strcat[m]> Ed: you can use a mouse too
12:33:16 <strcat[m]> what we're missing is a desktop-style launcher and usable support for video out but the latter is mostly a per-device thing not so much a generic OS issue (the OS supports it)
12:34:13 <greencreeper> I'm looking at the prerequisites and want to make sure I'm 100% clear with everything before I attempt anything. Having 2 GB of Free memory and 8 GB Free storage. Is this on the phone or the laptop I'll be using to install?
12:36:14 <nowmoon[m]> is there a way to change your bluetooth address in settings or is that persistent?
12:37:02 <nscnt[m]> greencreeper: Laptop
12:54:26 <iccedlemontea[m]> This question might sound unorthodox, but would it be possible to use the grapheneOS launcher/keyboard on another device? Like would it be possible to just apk it over?
12:54:37 <iccedlemontea[m]> Just suddenly got curious if it was possible
12:58:52 <strcat[m]> not supported
12:58:55 <strcat[m]> and doesn't make much sense
12:59:13 <strcat[m]> we hardly change the AOSP launcher or keyboard... why would you want to use them elsewhere?
12:59:30 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features you get none of that through using the launcher somewhere else
13:57:48 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> > <@rnd3sb3g13rng:matrix.org>  Thanks, will have a look at it.

14:44:02 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> If I search "call" in settings I see wifi calling related results, but when I click on them they are not shown. So wifi calling seems supported, but can't be disabled on unsupported carriers, requests to 3gppnetwork.org are made regardless.
15:12:24 <th0mcat> Can the "intensity" of Night Light be changed to different values?  I'm not asking (at this point) **to** have it changed, I'm just asking if it's possible.
15:16:27 <helloworldkk87[m> Yes
15:17:09 <Cliff[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Yes"> Where can you do that i have been looking?
15:18:06 <Cliff[m]> Never mind i had to turn in on to use the slider lol
15:18:16 <helloworldkk87[m> :D
15:19:42 <Cliff[m]> <th0mcat "Can the "intensity" of Night Lig"> Settings -> display -> nightlight
15:46:13 <jjstopper[m]> When should I expect to see the
15:46:14 <jjstopper[m]> GrapheneOS 2021.04.22.20 release update? Not seeing it update yet
15:46:53 <interesting[m]> is eSIM implementation coming any soon?
15:47:17 <helloworldkk87[m> > <@jjstopperl:matrix.org> When should I expect to see the
15:47:18 <helloworldkk87[m> > GrapheneOS 2021.04.22.20 release update? Not seeing it update yet
15:47:18 <helloworldkk87[m> It checks updates every 4 hours. Do also note that system update only works in owner profile
15:47:40 <helloworldkk87[m> <interesting[m] "is eSIM implementation coming an"> Depends on when are people going to help making it, might take 1 week might take 1 year
15:47:53 <interesting[m]> I see
16:01:07 <Pratyush[m]> <interesting[m] "is eSIM implementation coming an"> To fairly answer your question.
16:01:07 <jjstopper[m]> Question on users. I should add a new user and sign in to that profile rather than Owner? Can a new user install apps? Is it more secure to use Grapheneos that way?
16:02:25 <Pratyush[m]> secure? not really every user got same level of security.
16:02:25 <Pratyush[m]> privacy may be one user don't get access to other user data like installed apps, contacts and few other.
16:02:43 <Pratyush[m]> i might be wrong but this is what i know.
16:04:44 <Pratyush[m]> "Can a new user install apps? " yes on that user profile.
16:08:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> yes
16:09:26 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> encryption keys are per profile
16:09:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <q​ua3k> sensitive data should be kept in a secondary profile
16:11:37 <strcat[m]> jjstopper: the reason to leverage user profiles is the fact that each one has a separate set of apps, app data / profile data and separate encryption keys for all that data
16:13:14 <TheJollyRoger> Patrick[m]4: Face unlock on the Pixel 4 is fully working.
16:15:10 <strcat[m]> it's not a permission difference
16:15:16 <strcat[m]> Updater only runs in the owner profile
16:15:45 <strcat[m]> if it chose to run in other profiles it would work the same way, it's Updater that has the special permissions
16:16:03 <jjstopper[m]> strcat: oh OK. I love Grapheneos. Fairly new. Less than a month here. Thanks!
16:16:34 <strcat[m]> in general, system-wide stuff can only be configured via Owner because Settings and other privileged system apps choose to do it that way
16:17:20 <strcat[m]> and normal unprivileged apps can't do something like that
16:17:30 <jjstopper[m]> strcat: that makes it sound more secure to run normally as a different user
16:17:43 <strcat[m]> no, not really
16:17:47 <strcat[m]> I think you're misunderstanding how it works
16:17:59 <strcat[m]> user profiles are separate workspaces with their own apps, app data, profile data, encryption keys
16:18:05 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed
16:18:08 <TheJollyRoger> jjstopper[m]: So, the way Android does it, it essentially already is. Each process on Android is separately sandboxed individually.
16:18:15 <strcat[m]> user profiles do not provide an additional or stronger sandbox, that isn't how it works
16:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> This is the equivalent of running each process as a separate user account on the desktop.
16:18:41 <strcat[m]> the sandbox containing apps is the same strength in the owner profile or a secondary profile
16:18:44 <strcat[m]> and it has the same rules
16:19:02 <strcat[m]> the difference is which instance of the app it is (per-profile) with entirely separate app / profile data in each profile
16:19:30 <strcat[m]> no shared data / communication between profiles for a normal app (only a highly privileged system component built into the OS can do that, like Settings)
16:19:36 <jjstopper[m]> OK thanks!
16:19:51 <strcat[m]> every app you install is always sandboxed and you cannot grant it anything that would make it not sandboxed
16:20:08 <strcat[m]> you cannot give it a permission that would let it read another app's internal data, the OS data, or communicate across profiles
16:20:14 <strcat[m]> all apps are sandboxed
16:20:35 <strcat[m]> privileged OS components can do things regular apps cannot do, Settings, Updater, etc. are not simply regular apps, you CANNOT grant installed apps the ability to do the stuff they can
16:29:29 <TheJollyRoger> That's one of the things I like about Android; it's not like a desktop operating system, everything is separately sandboxed since the Android developers realized that putting all your eggs in one basket hasn't done us any favours over the last couple decades. It just gives the appearance to the user of being seamless.
16:31:24 <somenerd[m]> > This is the equivalent of running each process as a separate user account on the desktop.
16:31:24 <somenerd[m]> as well as access controls
16:31:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir!
16:36:13 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it's not really, user accounts on a traditional desktop OS aren't very isolated
16:36:24 * TheJollyRoger grimaces
16:36:25 <TheJollyRoger> Ack.
16:36:26 <strcat[m]> they can share data / communicate (including accidentally) and see what the other accounts are doing
16:36:47 <TheJollyRoger> I see, huh.
16:36:53 <TheJollyRoger> *d'oh.*
16:37:07 <strcat[m]> so for example if you run `some-command secret-password` every other user account can see you ran that on a traditional Linux OS (unless you use hidepid which is incompatible with systemd and other things without hacks)
16:37:27 <strcat[m]> and there are shared directories, /tmp is shared between all users and apps end up having vulnerabilities due to that
16:37:29 <strcat[m]> among many other things
16:37:37 <strcat[m]> the processes between users can communicate with each other, etc.
16:37:42 <strcat[m]> they are not isolated
16:38:03 <TheJollyRoger> Shoot. So it runs a ton deeper than just separating process space and access permissions. Hrrghk. Makes sense.
16:38:11 <strcat[m]> Android user profiles are isolated, each normal app (every installed app, and many of the system apps) runs in a per-user, per-app instance of the untrusted_app domain
16:38:23 <strcat[m]> Android uses both MAC and MLS
16:38:38 <strcat[m]> MLS is per-user, per-app security level that isolates apps in the same MAC domain from each other
16:39:18 <strcat[m]> legacy apps (API level before 28) still have per-user MLS but not per-app (so for example
16:39:22 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Neo (@N​eo795) has joined the Telegram Group!
16:39:32 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, wow. Even more in-depth than I thought.
16:39:40 <strcat[m]> so for example, say that an app does chmod -R 777 on their app data directory, probably by accident
16:40:02 <strcat[m]> apps in other user profiles can't access that data
16:40:13 <strcat[m]> or even see that it exists
16:40:24 <strcat[m]> for API 28+ apps, even apps in the same user profile can't
16:40:44 <strcat[m]> because per-app, per-profile MLS level instead of just per-profile
16:41:33 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r34/private/untrusted_app.te that's the one for modern apps
16:41:57 <strcat[m]> there are slightly weaker domains for legacy API levels, https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r34/private/untrusted_app_25.te is the oldest one
16:42:25 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/sepolicy/+/refs/tags/android-11.0.0_r34/private/seapp_contexts#171
16:42:47 <strcat[m]> levelFrom=all is what makes it per-app per-profile MLS level, levelFrom=user is per-profile
16:43:32 <strcat[m]> user=_app domain=untrusted_app_25 type=app_data_file levelFrom=user so that's the weakest available app sandbox, still really strong
16:43:46 <strcat[m]> the app is less protected from other apps in the same profile if it makes mistake than with API 28+
16:43:53 <dalvinchi[m]> Perhaps a dumb question, but I cannot find it from searching.
16:43:53 <dalvinchi[m]> Which do you think safer as a browser? Brave or Vanadium? I've been using Brave on PC for about a year now and I have zero complaints, their mobile browser is also fantastic and has zero tracker reports as per Exodus.
16:43:53 <dalvinchi[m]> Thoughts?
16:43:57 <strcat[m]> same protection from other profiles
16:44:23 <strcat[m]> dalvinchi: Vanadium, easily, if by 'safer' you mean against being exploited and having your data compromised and then beyond that
16:44:36 <strcat[m]> Brave adds substantial attack surface to Chromium and not as much hardening
16:44:52 <strcat[m]> it's an easy question if you mean that
16:44:52 <M9thplayer[m]> I'd rather use vanadium
16:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> dalvinchi[m]: Vanadium, without a doubt.
16:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> dalvinchi[m]: So, with respect to "trackers" what Exodus enumerates is actually a tad bit oversimplified.
16:45:46 <somenerd[m]> security, Vanadium
16:46:21 <somenerd[m]>  * for security, Vanadium
16:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> The privacy community has a bit of a pet obsession with enumerating proxy signals, without understanding what they're actually seeing. The libraries that exodus enumerates offer quick, easy, off-the-shelf functionality that application developers can use at their discretion.
16:46:33 <somenerd[m]> for privacy, I'm personally not sure
16:46:41 <TheJollyRoger> For Privacy, Vanadium.
16:46:45 <dalvinchi[m]> I figured as much, tbh the main reason I used Brave was because of the built in dark mode feature. I fucking hate huge white pages especially later in the night
16:46:53 <dalvinchi[m]> Thanks for all the answers btw!
16:46:57 <TheJollyRoger> How they actually use it, depends on the decisions that the application developers make when they decide to use that functionality.
16:47:09 * Pratyush[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iESpzmjyUHZxTknnRiBBlPkm/message.txt >
16:47:09 <somenerd[m]> > For Privacy, Vanadium.
16:47:09 <somenerd[m]> yeah, probably
16:47:16 <TheJollyRoger> I'll explain more in a sec:
16:47:19 <somenerd[m]> due to all of the fingerprint resistance
16:47:48 <somenerd[m]>  * due to all of the fingerprint resistance and privacy hardening
16:48:02 <jjstopper[m]> Can vanadium be installed on Linux?
16:48:05 <somenerd[m]> (removing sensors access to websites and stubbing the battery API, for example)
16:48:11 <TheJollyRoger> So the thing is, it being at the discretion of the app developers to make, means that simply including those libraries on their own, doesn't necessarily make the app invasive, because again it's at the discretion of the app developers to use. Sure, they can be used in invasive ways, but that's at the discretion of the app developers to do.
16:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> On the flip side, not including them doesn't necessarily mean the app is privacy-respecting, because there's absolutely *nothing* that stops the app authors from simply implementing those functions in their own way.
16:49:07 <strcat[m]> jjstopper: if by Linux you mean GrapheneOS, it's already there but it doesn't support any OS other than GrapheneOS
16:49:36 <strcat[m]> and likely won't unless someone provides full time developers with the aim of providing that while also giving us substantial benefits
16:49:38 <TheJollyRoger> jjstopper[m]: No. Vanadium is specific to GrapheneOS and leverages the improved memory safety/memory allocation and sandboxing improvements and hardened application runtime on GrapheneOS. You won't see any benefit anywhere else.
16:49:53 <TheJollyRoger> Because those improvements aren't going to be there on operating systems that aren't GrapheneOS.
16:50:51 <TheJollyRoger> dalvinchi[m]: So, with respect to privacy and Vanadium, I'll preface this with a joke.
16:50:53 <TheJollyRoger> You ready?
16:50:59 <TheJollyRoger> "Where do you hide an elephant?"
16:51:13 <TheJollyRoger> The answer is:
16:51:16 <TheJollyRoger> "Inside a herd of elephants."
16:51:47 <strcat[m]> ideally we get a device made with a hardware partner and sell millions of them so we can just focus on Vanadium blending in with Vanadium on the same device, which is a much stronger approach
16:51:48 <dalvinchi[m]> Also one other thing had crossed my mind,
16:51:49 <dalvinchi[m]> I am using Graphene as my daily driver. Duolingo/Memrise language apps are riddled with security concerns so I have opted for the 'add to homescreen' via vanadium.
16:51:49 <dalvinchi[m]> Does doing this breach privacy in ways similar to downloading the app itself or is this the more secure option?
16:51:54 <th0mcat> <Cliff[m] "Settings -> display -> nightligh"> Sorry, what I mean is, can the **maximum** threshold for Night Light be increased to mimic cf.lumen or the "Night Light [ROOT]" app?  Or, can a ROM be edited so you can direct edit the KCAL/RGB values *without* needing root?  I like having an entirely red-light-only mode for bedtime.  I know this probably could cause issues with an OLED/AMOLED screen if you use it too much
16:53:20 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that a browser is a state machine; the more you deviate from the norm, the more you stand out. Vanadium has been very carefully designed to mimic not only the browser, but also the software, and *hardware* fingerprint of the factory Pixel operating system (with Play Services and other invasive portions turned off or stubbed out), with zero add-ons and without any domains blocked, so as
16:53:23 <TheJollyRoger> to maximize your anonymity set.
16:53:25 <somenerd[m]> >Does doing this breach privacy in ways similar to downloading the app itself or is this the more secure option?
16:53:25 <somenerd[m]> It's definitely more secure
16:53:42 <somenerd[m]> the browser sandbox is far more restricted than the app sandbox
16:54:01 * hypokeimenon[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UZbFSTBZmbDzZSIqdzZaExRG/message.txt >
16:54:04 <TheJollyRoger> This is by design, because a majority of people that purchase Google Pixels, will be using Google Chrome if they're not running Graphene.
16:54:56 <TheJollyRoger> You have a better chance hiding among them, rather than hiding among people that are also running Pixels, and Brave, and have adblocking on, and have added and fine tuned your own adblocking lists, and set your own "tuning" options. By the time you've done that, you've practically reduced your anonymity set to zero.
16:56:06 <dalvinchi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "You have a better chance hiding "> Valid points. Thank you.
16:56:11 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
16:56:46 <dalvinchi[m]> Seriously impressed with the OS overall. Running it on Pixel 4a and its smooth as butter
16:58:33 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr! Welcome aboard the ship, shipmate!
17:00:15 <TheJollyRoger> th0mcat: I don't think you can at the moment, it might be possible to work that into your own build or patch it in though, if you know where to patch.
17:00:54 <somenerd[m]> it wouldn't be as secure as Vanadium on GrapheneOS afaicu
17:03:44 <somenerd[m]> since Vanadium partially depends on security enhancements from GrapheneOS
17:11:32 <duck[m]> <strcat[m] "Brave adds substantial attack su"> use chrome and be happy
17:14:11 <jjstopper[m]> Could I connect Grapheneos and a Pixel phone to a monitor?
17:17:14 <jjstopper[m]> And run it like a desktop computer
17:18:23 <strcat[m]> eventually
17:18:49 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier we don't provide a desktop launcher, don't enable free form window mode and the supported devices don't have video out support enabled
17:19:23 <M9thplayer[m]> I was literally wondering the same thing today as well. Thanks for the answer!
17:49:13 <snowlynx[m]> Take a look at displaylink docks that works
17:58:37 <doktorzhivago[m]> Also on a Pixel 4a, super impressed with the performance and overall usage.  Never thought I'd leave iOS
18:10:27 <WorstResponder> Hi guys, the update client has begun downloading the latest update 04.22. but it has been hanging at "Installing system update" at about 50% for over an hour now. Any tips on what to do? Don't wanna reboot and bork something..
18:12:30 <strcat[m]> there's nothing you can screw up rebooting
18:12:32 <strcat[m]> please read docs on updates
18:12:52 <strcat[m]> chances are the notification just stopped being updated and it finished successfully, that can happen if you closed the app
18:13:13 <strcat[m]> if you open up update settings and force close it, the notification will stop updating
18:13:28 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean the update stopped
18:13:38 <strcat[m]> means you closed the app that updates it as update_engine goes
18:13:57 <GhostSplinterSix> <WorstResponder "Hi guys, the update client has b"> It should be fine. Mine took a little bit and successfully updated.
18:14:19 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
18:14:43 <strcat[m]> if the power cuts out at any point in the update process, it does not matter
18:15:05 <strcat[m]> if the app that watches the progress and updates the notification closes (ideally it wouldn't happen, but it can), doesn't matter
18:15:06 <GhostSplinterSix> <doktorzhivago[m] "Also on a Pixel 4a, super impres"> I completely agree. I'm in love with my Pixel 4a and GrapheneOS.
18:15:41 <strcat[m]> if update_engine has a serious bug and corrupts the newly installed update, that's not very good, but the device will just fail to boot and then go back to old version since new one didn't work
18:17:14 <strcat[m]> the only thing that could really go wrong is if update_engine had some ridiculously bad bug where it accidentally overwrote user data or something like that, somehow, but it may not actually be able to screw up that badly due to the SELinux policy
18:17:41 <strcat[m]> also pretty hard to imagine how that would happen on 1 device but not all the rest
18:18:34 <GhostSplinterSix> I appreciate the information.
18:19:38 <WorstResponder> Thanks for the explanation strcat, but I didn't touch anything other than manually check for updates and immediately after that the notification appeared.
18:21:47 <strcat[m]> WorstResponder: and then you probably closed the settings activity you had opened
18:21:55 <strcat[m]> which, as I said, would have stopped the notification from updating
18:22:06 <WorstResponder> Ok I just tapped on the notification and it went away. I guess it updated successfully and is just waiting for a reboot now.
18:22:20 <strcat[m]> I know what happened
18:22:23 <strcat[m]> it's just how Android works
18:22:33 <strcat[m]> if you close an app via recent apps, it closes the app's services too
18:22:42 <strcat[m]> it doesn't break it from updating, it just stops the notification updating
18:22:48 <strcat[m]> known issue, not clear how to do anything about it
18:22:52 <strcat[m]> simply how the OS works
18:23:04 <WorstResponder> But I didn't close it via recent apps. I just switched back to Vanadium
18:23:14 <strcat[m]> you probably did close it
18:23:25 <WorstResponder> By double tapping the recents button
18:23:56 <WorstResponder> Well I guess I'll just reboot and check the version number
18:24:13 <strcat[m]> there is no risk
18:24:32 <strcat[m]> if it's not done, then it will just start over installing it
18:24:32 <WorstResponder> Thanks a lot
18:24:36 <strcat[m]> if it's done, you'll be on the new version
18:24:39 <strcat[m]> won't redownload it
18:24:45 <strcat[m]> 0 risk from powering off during update install
18:25:14 <strcat[m]> and we know the notification is not 100% reliable, it's a UI issue that's hard to work around because Android really loves killing background services including when user kills their activities
18:25:27 <strcat[m]> we could make it a foreground service and then it'd be much more reluctant to kill it
18:25:36 <strcat[m]> that's probably what we have to do, need a contributor to work on it
18:25:46 <strcat[m]> very minor UI thing
18:28:44 <WorstResponder33> Well whaddaya know, I rebooted and I'm on the latest version. Seems it really was just a UI bug. Thanks for the explanation!
18:33:58 <GhostSplinterSix> 😎👍
18:42:17 <Cliff[m]> helloworldkk87 doesnt the updater work in second profile? Does it give notifications that an update is available and then you can only install in owner profile?
18:44:28 <strcat[m]> it only runs in the Owner profile
18:44:34 <strcat[m]> we don't want to make it run in secondary profiles
18:44:53 <strcat[m]> showing an indication of notifications in other profiles does not seem to be something to hard-wire for Updater
18:45:08 <strcat[m]> it doesn't make sense to have multiple instances of it running and checking for updates
18:45:09 <strcat[m]> not doing that
18:45:22 <strcat[m]> also you don't manually install the updates anyway
18:47:08 <doktorzhivago[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "I completely agree. I'm in love "> I am a monthly supporter as well, this project needs to be funded as good as can be
18:48:23 <GhostSplinterSix> Amen to that. 👍
18:49:07 <strcat[m]> we mostly need contributions to the code and developers we can hire
18:51:57 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> how do i stop GOS from sending requests to *.mnc*.mcc*.pub.3gppnetwork.org?
18:53:15 <iccedlemontea[m]> Oh new update just dropped?

18:56:25 <strcat[m]> after a day in beta testing, it was pushed out via stable

18:58:10 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> why would my carrier make GOS send requests only via wifi? it should have something to do with how GOS handle wifi calling?
18:58:23 <iccedlemontea[m]> So as long as there's an update from the seamless update client, it should be safe to just update it right? (I dont expect to be targeted)

18:59:30 <strcat[m]> stated above
19:00:07 <strcat[m]> the detailed information on the site has everything you should know
19:00:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> I deleted all APNs and it still send those requests
19:00:46 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <K​ileXt> This seamless update mechanism is the best though. Every EOM should do that
19:01:51 <strcat[m]> as I said it's the connection to your carrier's server
19:02:01 <strcat[m]> if you delete the APNs you may also need to reboot
19:02:16 <strcat[m]> removing the SIM is the most direct way to disable using that carrier
19:02:28 <strcat[m]> there is more than just the APNs
19:02:32 <strcat[m]> not really clear what you want to accomplish
19:02:39 <strcat[m]> if you don't want to be using that carrier, don't
19:02:59 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS comes with no standard / included carrier, you chose to use that carrier, and you can choose to stop using it
19:03:25 <strcat[m]> LTE and later handle calls, text and other services via data using SIP as part of IMS
19:03:48 <strcat[m]> so, that's how it works, it connects to the servers for IMS, that's part of what a carrier is
19:04:16 <strcat[m]> no such thing as non-data-based calls and text for LTE and beyond
19:04:23 <strcat[m]> it's not a bad thing in any sense
19:05:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> its connecting via wif, its would be fine if its connecting via lte
19:06:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> so i'm trying to find out how to configure vowifi, i'd disable it
19:07:33 <strcat[m]> it's connecting via data, it's not really truly different
19:07:57 <strcat[m]> making it not work via Wi-Fi is basically an artificial limitation to make you use carrier phones / bloatware...
19:08:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> no, seriously, i find dns request on my router
19:08:49 <strcat[m]> please read what I wrote earlier
19:09:13 <strcat[m]> I also assume it's going to be broken now if you actually deleted all the APNs
19:09:25 <strcat[m]> so you'll to redo that setup if you actually want to use it
19:10:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> https://www.kuketz-blog.de/rueckmeldung-von-daniel-micay-grapheneos-entwickler/ see[5]
19:12:14 <strcat[m]> I already explained above
19:12:24 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS does not make that connection by default
19:12:33 <strcat[m]> the documentation at https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections is accurate
19:12:43 <strcat[m]> take out your SIM card, stop using that carrier
19:13:07 <strcat[m]> factory reset to remove apps you've installed and configuration you've changed / added
19:13:15 <strcat[m]> it will match the default connections there
19:14:27 <strcat[m]> calls, voice, etc. on LTE and beyond are simply data-based
19:15:03 <strcat[m]> use a VPN/Tor if you want it merged with traffic from other users
19:15:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> I only installed apps from F-Droid. Let me phrase is this way, I can find "wifi calling" by searching "call" in settings, but that leads me to nothing.
19:15:49 <strcat[m]>  * calls, texts, etc. on LTE and beyond are simply data-based
19:16:07 <strcat[m]> the way calls and texts works on modern networks is not really tied to the cellular connection
19:16:12 <strcat[m]> carrier settings are carrier specific
19:16:20 <strcat[m]> only certain carriers support a Wi-Fi calling toggle
19:16:41 <strcat[m]> some support changing preferred network mode, some don't, etc.
19:16:54 <strcat[m]> the only thing we currently forcefully override is making tethering always available
19:17:08 <strcat[m]> we don't currently attempt to offer other unsupported features / toggles
19:17:46 <strcat[m]> some carriers lack IMS-based voice/text support, others have it, not all of them really distinguish between different forms of it
19:18:16 <strcat[m]> "VoLTE" and "VoWiFi" are more user-facing marketing terms than how it actually works
19:18:53 <strcat[m]> calls over Wi-Fi and 5G are essentially the same thing as "VoLTE"
19:19:03 <strcat[m]> it's the same code, same servers usually
19:19:18 <strcat[m]> it's simply data-based calls, text, etc. via SIP/IMS
19:19:20 <strcat[m]> as I explained
19:19:43 <strcat[m]> some carriers want to make it complicated and do weird product segmentation, and force people to get carrier phones and to use carrier apps
19:20:00 <strcat[m]> or feel grateful that their carrier gave them standard features
19:20:29 <strcat[m]> the carrier-specific configuration includes all kinds of stuff like that, they can set a setting that makes the signal appear 1 bar higher than it actually is, or to mislead users calling 4G "5GE"
19:21:14 <strcat[m]> as I said only thing we override atm is always making tethering available, the other toggles, how things are displayed (LTE vs. 4G, signal strength) are influenced by the carrier configuration
19:22:11 <strcat[m]> exposing unsupported toggles, etc. is likely to break unless there is a specific reason to believe it okay and should always be offered
19:22:21 <strcat[m]> carriers are dropping 2G/3G
19:22:48 <strcat[m]> "VoLTE", "VoWiFi" etc. is just the default, standard level of functionality
19:23:13 <strcat[m]> if a carrier does not have those working with a standard AOSP / GrapheneOS device... something is seriously wrong with them
19:23:28 <strcat[m]> (definitely applies to the shitty carrier I use)
19:25:21 <strcat[m]> when configured to use a carrier, that includes having SIP/IMS connection to their servers
19:26:21 <strcat[m]> and also when you enable location + are connected to cell network, your carrier's network is used to help quickly determine location via A-GPS rather than using pure unassisted GPS (it doesn't give them additional info they can't already determine)
19:28:02 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections is accurate including covering Vanadium
19:28:45 <strcat[m]> we do not currently have a section explaining how modern carrier-based calls/texts work once you configure a carrier (putting in a SIM triggers configuring that as the carrier)
19:29:11 <strcat[m]> it really isn't particularly interesting it's just like using an app with SIP with a lot of bureaucracy
19:29:27 <strcat[m]> it is literally just SIP
19:29:47 <strcat[m]> 2G/3G use some terrible legacy cruft instead
19:30:37 <strcat[m]> broken carriers without proper non-obsolete calls/texts have to fall back to using 2G/3G
19:31:17 <iccedlemontea[m]> strcat i really dont dare touch the APN's, and although i sometimes get the random updates - should this be a concern for me?
19:31:38 <strcat[m]> you don't get 'random updates'
19:31:44 <strcat[m]> and there is no need to be concerned about APNs
19:32:01 <strcat[m]> iccedlemontea: please read https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases and https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
19:32:08 <strcat[m]> and look at https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
19:32:15 <iccedlemontea[m]> As i just got a seamless update client thingy just now
19:32:39 <strcat[m]> iccedlemontea: read that info before continuing discussion here
19:33:25 <alex-resist> Is there anything non-trivial in the latest beta release on bonito that should be tested?
19:33:59 <alex-resist> Everything seems to be working fine
19:34:39 <alex-resist> (I would like to do more beta testing, but since everything is working fine usually, I don't really know what to look for)
19:34:55 <strcat[m]> no, already shipped stable release since it has an important fix working around AOSP's new eBPF-based INTERNET not working well for us
19:35:09 <strcat[m]> no major changes
19:36:14 <alex-resist> Ok good! Will try to hang out more in this channel again, it's often quite educational
19:36:39 <bluebird> Even if I don't have a sim card in my phone it can make emergency calls, I guess that means that the mobile operators can log the whereabouts of my IMEI all the time? Is there a way to completely turn off the cellular connection while still having the wlan connection?
19:37:51 <strcat[m]> no, that's not what it means
19:37:57 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking
19:38:04 <strcat[m]> recommend reading FAQ section on cellular
19:38:20 <strcat[m]> emergency calls do not require a mobile subscription
19:38:31 <strcat[m]> the purpose of a SIM / eSIM is to authenticate you to the network as part your mobile plan
19:38:49 <strcat[m]> having a SIM vs. not having a SIM is not a toggle for the cellular radio, but of course there is a toggle for that
19:39:17 <strcat[m]> and also, as just explained in depth above, carrier-based calls/texts do not require using cellular
19:39:23 <snowlynx[m]> Flight mode + wifi on
19:39:32 <strcat[m]> you can happily use carrier-based calls/texts via Wi-Fi or even USB ethernet, etc.
19:39:50 <strcat[m]> as long as the carrier isn't broken
19:40:04 <strcat[m]> sadly, many are broken or stuck in 2014
19:41:29 <alex-resist> I think bluebird's question was: if you use a phone with no SIM and airplane mode off, is the IMEI exposed to any cellular service provider, or will it only be transmitted when an authentication attempt occurs including a SIM?
19:42:38 <strcat[m]> neither
19:42:56 <strcat[m]> my answer above explains it
19:43:03 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding what a SIM does
19:44:24 <strcat[m]> also making an emergency call is a UI for connecting for enabling cellular if disabling and making it via whatever network is available (currently configured network preferred, definitely not mandatory)
19:44:33 <strcat[m]>  * also making an emergency call is a UI for connecting for enabling cellular if disabled and making it via whatever network is available (currently configured network preferred, definitely not mandatory)
19:44:36 <strcat[m]> that is the purpose of the UI
19:44:56 <strcat[m]> if you have no connection to your configured carrier, doesn't matter, emergency call UI can still make an emergency call
19:45:06 <alex-resist> So what does happen when using a phone without a SIM and with airplane mode off? In what way is the modem active?
19:45:12 <strcat[m]> regulations require that carriers allow random unauthenticated people to connect and make an emergency call
19:45:14 <alex-resist> I'm confused, sorry
19:45:25 <strcat[m]> SIM card is not a toggle for cellular being enabled or disabled
19:45:36 <strcat[m]> but the device isn't just going to be randomly connecting to networks
19:45:54 <strcat[m]> if you ask to make an emergency call, you're very explicitly asking to do that
19:46:07 <strcat[m]> if you think an emergency call won't work because you have airplane mode enabled
19:46:13 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding what the emergency call UI does
19:46:31 <alex-resist> Yeah, I'm not interested in the emergency call aspect, that was bluebird's question. I'm interested in the activity of the cellular modem without SIM and without airplane mode. Does it just idle around?
19:46:42 <strcat[m]> it deals with whatever it has to deal with to make an emergency call, you are explicitly disabling airplane mode to make the call if you make an emergency call
19:47:32 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: it doesn't permissively broadcast info if you aren't configured to use a network
19:47:47 <strcat[m]> but it isn't disabled if you have airplane mode off
19:47:58 <strcat[m]> it's like having Wi-Fi enabled by not connected to anything
19:48:32 <alex-resist> Ok, so someone actively searching for the IMEI of the device wouldn't be able to find it? Similar to someone looking for a MAC when WiFi is not connected?
19:48:47 <bluebird> ok, thanks for the info
19:49:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> So GOS won't override anything, it will just parse carrier settings from SIM card and do whatever the carrier requests, no options.
19:49:54 <strcat[m]> no, it won't do whatever the carrier requests
19:50:14 <strcat[m]> and in fact, it's GrapheneOS that has most of the relevant carrier configuration built into it
19:50:52 <strcat[m]> if a carrier doesn't support a toggle for VoLTE, it won't show a toggle for VoLTE
19:50:55 <strcat[m]> the reason could be that they ONLY have VoLTE
19:51:04 <strcat[m]> or intend to move to that
19:51:22 <strcat[m]> the reason for there being a toggle for VoLTE is generally because the carrier has a broken implementation and gives users a way to work around known issues
19:51:32 <strcat[m]> there isn't really meant to be a toggle for that stuff, it's just meant to work
19:51:48 <strcat[m]> we need toggles for disabling legacy stuff (LTE only mode was added to do that)
19:51:58 <strcat[m]> there is no escaping the fact that 2G/3G are dying
19:52:52 <strcat[m]> and we're aware on a few carriers (not many) the LTE only toggle isn't available and we need to do research into whether we should override it as we do for tethering (which was done carefully after figuring out how to do it right)
19:53:25 <strcat[m]> I don't think there is a VoLTE toggle, etc. by default, the carrier has to request it
19:53:33 <jamesbrunet[m]> Hey, I'm having the most odd issue with a pixel 5 running graphene. When I power on my phone, it shows the correct battery level, but it drops 1% per minute all the way to 1% remaining, and stays at 1% for hours.
19:53:33 <jamesbrunet[m]> Some folks complained about the battery indicator (slightly different issue) with the pixel 5 in the past, but from reading articles online this should have been fixed in the march update.
19:53:33 <jamesbrunet[m]> Is my phone defective or is this a known issue with grapheme?
19:53:43 <jamesbrunet[m]> * Hey, I'm having the most odd issue with a pixel 5 running graphene. When I power on my phone, it shows the correct battery level, but it drops 1% per minute all the way to 1% remaining, and stays at 1% for hours.

19:53:43 <jamesbrunet[m]> Is my phone defective or is this a known issue with graphene?
19:53:49 <strcat[m]> jamesbrunet: not an issue with GrapheneOS
19:53:57 <strcat[m]> jamesbrunet: sounds like the battery is messed up
19:54:05 <strcat[m]> the battery is supposed to tell the OS the capacity
19:54:12 <strcat[m]> sounds like it is misconfigured
19:54:28 <Cliff[m]> <strcat[m] "we don't want to make it run in "> So if i use a secondary profile as my main then i should manually check for updates in the main profile or ?
19:54:31 <jamesbrunet[m]> Awesome, ty
19:54:54 <strcat[m]> Cliff: you could do that, or use a feed reader to watch for updates
19:55:05 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases.atom
19:55:19 <strcat[m]> as I said we're aware that it's inconvenient to not see that you have notifications in other profiles that are active
19:55:40 <strcat[m]> we are not going to work around it on a case-by-case basis by essentially adding extra apps which do additional checks, etc.
19:56:26 <strcat[m]> it only makes sense for there to be 1 Updater, not each profile simultaneously trying to update the OS
19:56:46 <strcat[m]> and I don't think it makes sense to have extra copies of the app checking for updates but not doing anything in secondary profiles
19:57:17 <strcat[m]> and also don't think it makes sense to give it the interact with other users privileged app permission and implement some kind of notification sharing specific to it... just does not make sense, not how we do things
19:57:27 <strcat[m]> we don't take the approach of hacking things together with workarounds and bad design
19:57:38 <strcat[m]> we take the longer, harder path of doing things correctly in a way that makes sense
20:01:19 <Cliff[m]> strcat I am in this channel and i also follow the graphene os official twitter so when an update is available i will see thanks!
20:02:03 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "we don't take the approach of ha"> and that is super duper appreciated and welcomed. quality assurance and good solution finding is so underestimated
20:02:35 <r0tt0r[m]> i bend my knee for this mind of professionalism
20:02:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> seems whenever there is a network change (  wifi switch or remove/insert sim card) the system connects to ims servers via wifi
20:03:01 <strcat[m]> similarly why we didn't want to hack together some unreliable, questionable script for installing which doesn't have a way to do meaningful signature verification
20:03:42 <r0tt0r[m]> i would appreciate a method to limit apps to lan/wan/wifi/ether
20:03:42 <strcat[m]> rather than the more sensible approach of the web installer for users who aren't familiar with downloading and verifying a signature for the OS with a key verified across multiple locations
20:03:59 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: the way it's implemented elsewhere is broken / insecure
20:04:34 <strcat[m]> the CalyxOS/LineageOS approach to it is done insecurely, for example, and can be bypassed by apps, and we don't like making features where apps can just bypass it
20:05:00 <strcat[m]> they just extended what Android already does which was only ever meant to be a data saving feature, not something setting a privacy/security boundary
20:05:17 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: the way it's implemented"> ye i know , i understand network permissions is the right/better way though i wonder if somehow it could be done
20:05:47 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: it fundamentally is not how networks work, for one thing (about LAN), makes assumptions which do not hold about that and then there's the fact that it's totally bypassed through IPC
20:06:00 <r0tt0r[m]> i want some apps only locally connecting and not go outside, would be big hassle to limit all connections on router level
20:06:47 <strcat[m]> a profile sounds like the best approach to that
20:06:51 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "r0tt0r: it fundamentally is not "> ye understood, so subnet limiting not work i guess
20:06:55 <strcat[m]> and we plan to make profiles more flexible including having multiple nested ones
20:07:07 <strcat[m]> and not having to misuse that work profile feature
20:07:12 <strcat[m]> for a nested one
20:07:16 <strcat[m]> because it's super flawed for that use
20:07:29 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "and we plan to make profiles mor"> oh that sounds like a possible good solution
20:09:05 <strcat[m]> we also want to change how VPNs work
20:09:06 <strcat[m]> they are already configured per-profile, which is good
20:09:08 <strcat[m]> but the way it works is... really odd
20:09:21 <strcat[m]> it should only route traffic through the VPN of a profile from that profile
20:09:25 <strcat[m]> and system traffic always via owner
20:09:29 <strcat[m]> it's good that it's granular
20:09:46 <strcat[m]> what's bad is that there is really just 1 VPN at a time
20:09:59 <strcat[m]> you should be able to use a different VPN for each profile for real, in a way that's kept separate
20:10:09 <strcat[m]> without the hassle of always remembering to end session on secondary profiles rather than switching
20:10:19 <r0tt0r[m]> for my vpn app it has all i need, split tunneling, forcing only vpn/allow lan and i requested a feature to include dns blocking per user liking
20:10:54 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "you should be able to use a diff"> it works
20:10:58 <covid-1984[m]> Interesting receiving calls from inside another profile that I thought only the owner profile could accept.
20:11:13 <strcat[m]> can receive in any
20:11:14 <covid-1984[m]> I'll have to reproduce it if it isn't expected
20:11:21 <strcat[m]> it's supposed to be that way
20:11:26 <covid-1984[m]> Ok makes sense
20:11:37 <strcat[m]> there's a toggle to enable more functionality too
20:11:38 <r0tt0r[m]> i use vpn in work and normal and use one profile using vpn only and other with bpn + excluded apps
20:11:41 <strcat[m]> it could be finer-grained that it is
20:11:44 <strcat[m]> but that's how it works right now
20:11:55 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> GOS always does a NS query to 3gppnetwork whenever I connect or switch WiFi, any possible solutions?
20:12:04 <r0tt0r[m]> * i use vpn in work and normal and use one profile using vpn only and other with vpn + excluded apps
20:12:44 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier that's based on your carrier, that's not something GrapheneOS does normally
20:12:48 <strcat[m]> refer back to that conversation
20:12:52 <strcat[m]> I don't think it needs to keep going on
20:13:09 <strcat[m]> you aren't satisfied with the way things work, fine, but please stop what is essentially concern trolling
20:13:30 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> yes, but GOS can improve it?
20:13:37 <strcat[m]> what should we improve?
20:13:46 <strcat[m]> there does not appear to be a problem
20:13:52 <r0tt0r[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!null> GOS always does a NS que"> when in wifi range (in lockdown always :) i go first flightmode then enable wifi only
20:14:07 <strcat[m]> you configured that carrier, and so it's used as the carrier, and they seem to have working IMS-based calls/texts
20:14:12 <strcat[m]> which is good
20:15:37 <duck[m]> you want grapheneos to “improve” connections to a carrier you configured lol
20:15:40 <strcat[m]> recommend using a VPN if your concern is simply that through making a connection to them, they know your IP address
20:15:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> yes, but i'd like to able to block it from using my wifi, i don't like my ISP know I'm using a phone not from them
20:16:07 <duck[m]> they already know
20:16:27 <strcat[m]> I'm not really sure what is meant by that
20:16:27 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> no they dont, i might be using a tablet
20:16:43 <strcat[m]> it's not really clear how that's connected to this
20:16:59 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> Like my phone is from verizon, my cable is at&t
20:17:17 <r0tt0r[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!null> yes, but i'd like to abl"> isnt that settings, network, mobile, advanced wifi telephony?
20:17:25 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> they at&t knows, oh, he has a phone from verizon
20:17:34 <strcat[m]> as I suggest earlier: VPN
20:17:38 <duck[m]> you want graphene to break ims calls so your isp won’t see connections to another carrier? lol
20:17:38 <strcat[m]>  * as I suggested earlier: VPN
20:18:03 <strcat[m]> VoWiFi toggle != a toggle that prevents IMS connections via Wi-Fi btw
20:18:13 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> I wanted to disable vowifi not volte
20:18:29 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "VoWiFi toggle != a toggle that p"> oh ok
20:18:34 <duck[m]> then disable vowifi
20:18:37 <strcat[m]> but you probably also want to disable texts over Wi-Fi
20:18:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> oh, how do i stop connect to ims via wifi
20:18:54 <strcat[m]> you can disable IMS but...
20:19:18 <strcat[m]> you are going to have to turn it on when you want to use calls/texts and that isn't really something the UI makes convenient
20:19:54 <r0tt0r[m]> apn change needed?not sure though
20:21:04 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> that connection to ims server via wifi is persistent, unless I remove sim card AND reboot
20:22:20 <strcat[m]> that's normal
20:22:24 <strcat[m]> that's just how carrier provisioning works
20:22:34 <strcat[m]> it's nothing unusual or concerning
20:22:45 <strcat[m]> look, when you configure a carrier, the OS connects to them per your request
20:23:31 <chile09[m]> How does GrapheneOS mitigate mitigate some of the FSF concerns regarding Snapdragon SOCs

20:24:24 <strcat[m]> chile09: Snapdragon is the most hardened / secure mobile SoC
20:24:27 <duck[m]> <chile09[m] "How does GrapheneOS mitigate mit"> by ignoring their fearmongering
20:24:34 <strcat[m]> chile09: don't know what concerns you have, sounds like you've fallen for misinformation
20:24:39 <strcat[m]> please don't spread that kind of misinformation here, thanks
20:24:43 <strcat[m]> not a reliable source of info
20:25:13 <strcat[m]> there is no open source mobile SoC at this point and open source != more private/secure

20:25:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> you HAVE TO trust hardware vendors for now and for a quite very long while
20:25:59 <duck[m]> disable microcode updates to be the most secure!!!
20:26:02 <strcat[m]> even the open-ish ones are partially closed
20:26:13 <strcat[m]> an open source SoC does not reduce trust in the hardware vendor
20:26:43 <strcat[m]> you still trust whoever who designed the SoC and whoever manufactured it
20:26:49 <strcat[m]>  * you still trust whoever designed the SoC and whoever manufactured it
20:27:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> The best i can think of is add multi layers of security
20:28:09 <strcat[m]> we want to have our own hardware where we can make more of the decisions but from an end user perspective it's going to be the same, just with GrapheneOS as stock OS
20:28:46 <strcat[m]> and we'd use a Snapdragon SoC, ideally also their secure element if it fills in some missing functionality
20:28:54 <strcat[m]> since we wouldn't have Titan M
20:29:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> So there's no way to block requests to IMS servers via WiFi? Even just block the NS query will be OK.
20:29:34 <strcat[m]> you can disable it
20:29:45 <strcat[m]> you'd have to enable it when required since I don't think it's separate for Wi-Fi
20:29:56 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> I find no way to edit hosts since no root
20:30:04 <r0tt0r[m]> grapheneos pixel edition device, shut up and take my money, where can i order 😃
20:30:22 <strcat[m]> you don't need to 'edit hosts', that's not actually a proper way to block something anyway
20:30:33 <strcat[m]> and also don't really understand why you'd do that
20:30:43 <r0tt0r[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!null> I find no way to edit ho"> adaway works through vpn interface
20:30:59 <strcat[m]> I suggest looking at the options you have to disable / enable those apps / features
20:31:00 <strcat[m]> in the OS
20:31:17 <strcat[m]> a VoWiFi toggle would not do what you want
20:31:19 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> My goal is simple, connect to nothing via wifi when i do nothing
20:31:33 <strcat[m]> so, we could have a VoWiFi toggle force enabled but it wouldn't do what you want
20:31:39 <chile09[m]> Snapdragon SOCs generally require signed, non-free software to boot: an unconditionally signed first-stage SPL, and a sometimes signed second-staged LK bootloader
20:31:43 <strcat[m]> it would just disable using VoWiFi when available
20:31:54 <strcat[m]> chile09: we wouldn't use an SoC without a secure boot chain
20:32:01 <strcat[m]> chile09: we won't use an insecure SoC
20:32:33 <strcat[m]> anyway the late stage bootloader is EDK2-based not LK-based anyway
20:32:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> you said i can disable it, how do i disable it without removing sim
20:32:58 <duck[m]> <chile09[m] "Snapdragon SOCs generally requir"> oh no they have security
20:33:07 <strcat[m]> also that's not non-free software... the late stage bootloader is open source
20:33:32 <strcat[m]> doesn't make any difference to privacy/security
20:33:44 <strcat[m]> beyond it being a bit easier to give useful bug reports to them
20:33:52 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> non-free software or hardware? the line blurs here
20:34:40 <strcat[m]> chile09: https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/abl/tianocore/edk2/
20:35:54 <strcat[m]> https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/abl/tianocore/edk2/tree/QcomModulePkg/Library/BootLib/FastbootMenu.c?h=LA.AU.0.0.1_rb1.22
20:35:55 <strcat[m]> https://source.codeaurora.org/quic/la/abl/tianocore/edk2/tree/QcomModulePkg/Library/BootLib/VerifiedBootMenu.c?h=LA.AU.0.0.1_rb1.22
20:35:59 <strcat[m]> should look familiar
20:36:27 <snowlynx[m]> Will updates for titan m work with grapheneos ? Because of signing keys?
20:36:35 <strcat[m]> works fine
20:36:48 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS provides updates for all the firmware, mentioned on our site
20:36:59 <strcat[m]> Titan M updates can only be applied by the OS once owner authenticates
20:37:15 <strcat[m]> since Titan M requires that in addition to the firmware being correctly signed
20:37:29 <strcat[m]> correctly signed firmware update won't be accepted until you've authenticated
20:38:58 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> is there any way to edit my dns and survive wifi changes?
20:39:32 <strcat[m]> sure but again this is not a good approach and does not really achieve what you want
20:39:51 <strcat[m]> our faq covers a lot of what you're asking
20:39:53 <strcat[m]> please check that 1st
20:40:43 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!null> I see no way to block connections to 3gppnetwork.org
20:41:59 <strcat[m]> okay
20:42:31 <strcat[m]> there is a difference between blocking connections to some specific domain and disabling IMS
20:42:46 <strcat[m]> the FAQ covers a lot of the topics you're asking about, please read the content that's there for what it covers
20:42:59 <strcat[m]> I do not think this is a productive use of the channel and it needs to stop
20:46:04 <r0tt0r[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!null> I see no way to block co"> as stated already, install adaway, use vpn option, add the dns you want to block, profit?
20:46:54 <strcat[m]> the dialer settings in Dialer -> Settings -> Calls, etc.
20:47:32 <strcat[m]> my suggestion would be trying to disable the services you don't want in the various places available to configure things
20:48:32 <chile09[m]> What parts of the SoC would be considered non-free?
20:48:40 <strcat[m]> the entire thing
20:48:50 <strcat[m]> same answer for any x86 or ARM SoC/CPU/GPU
20:49:16 <strcat[m]> not really on-topic for the channel
20:49:20 <chile09[m]> That's a binary answer
20:49:44 <strcat[m]> the entire SoC is closed source, it's the same answer for some Samsung SoC, some Qualcomm SoC, an Intel CPU
20:50:25 <strcat[m]> if you want an open source SoC, I suggest OpenPOWER, which is the closest thing available to a fully open hardware platform
20:50:32 <strcat[m]> not on-topic for the channel
22:19:30 <hellow> hellow
22:20:10 <GhostSplinterSix> 👋
22:20:14 <hellow> hellow
22:20:31 <hellow> so
22:20:43 <hellow> is this the support channel or something?
22:20:53 <hellow> no1 is talking lol
22:21:09 <thomashensel[m]> Hi! Its a General channel i guess maybe we can support you
22:21:31 <hellow> yea i was wondering if there are more supported samsung devices?
22:21:37 <hellow> for the os
22:22:06 <GhostSplinterSix> <hellow "no1 is talking lol"> This is a very active channel.
22:22:32 <hellow> y dont u then go to discord?
22:22:33 <GhostSplinterSix> <hellow "yea i was wondering if there are"> Have you checked the website?
22:22:43 <thomashensel[m]> <hellow "yea i was wondering if there are"> Nope, See the FAQ only pixel devices afaik.
22:22:48 <hellow> yea i did, only s4 i guess
22:23:01 <GhostSplinterSix> <hellow "y dont u then go to discord?"> For obvious reasons.
22:23:07 <hellow> lol
22:23:23 <hellow> so u guys just chat here?
22:23:28 <hellow> about OS only
22:23:31 <hellow> nothing else?
22:23:46 <GhostSplinterSix> Yes. As stated on the website.
22:24:02 <dnull> There is an -offtopic channel
22:24:11 <hellow> can u create it
22:24:12 <hellow> cant see it
22:24:26 <maikeru> hello guys
22:24:34 <hellow> hellow
22:24:40 <maikeru> ^^
22:25:09 <GhostSplinterSix> The only supported devices are the Pixel 3 and newer devices.
22:25:50 <hellow> 😔
22:26:11 <GhostSplinterSix> https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
22:26:44 <thomashensel[m]> Does anyone know how long my pixel 3a will get updates? I finally got it set up with all apps I need
22:27:23 <hellow> maybe couple of years?
22:27:56 <hellow> idk, im new to grapheneOS and dont have a supported device so yea
22:27:58 <dnull> As long as google provides updates
22:28:11 <duck[m]> <thomashensel[m] "Does anyone know how long my pix"> May 2022
22:28:46 <hellow> lol thats close
22:28:58 <thomashensel[m]> So in a year I'll need a new phone. Oh well
22:29:08 <hellow> not rly
22:29:12 <hellow> my phone is 6 years old
22:29:30 <hellow> its doing great
22:30:45 <thomashensel[m]> <hellow "my phone is 6 years old"> And Samsung isn't exactly known for decent security updates on older devices
22:30:58 <hellow> yea ik lol
22:31:05 <hypokeimenon[m]> Yes, Graphene OS are very dissatisfied with the state of support on Pixels. Optimally they would support fewer devices for much longer.
22:31:31 <hellow> are they're budget tight or something?
22:32:04 <hellow> if ppl have the source code, can't they technically make the OS support other devices?
22:32:06 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's not really a budget constraint.
22:32:06 <GhostSplinterSix> <thomashensel[m] "So in a year I'll need a new pho"> It happens. The 4 series aren't all that expensive thankfully.
22:32:36 <Guest50779> a low quality port not providing the same privacy/security and not meeting the same standards is not comparable
22:32:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> hellow Graphene OS supports devices that meet the requirements for providing good security.
22:32:56 <Guest50779> you can port it to whatever you want but it's your own OS not GrapheneOS
22:33:01 <thomashensel[m]> <GhostSplinterSix "It happens. The 4 series aren't "> Well its better then nothing, I just need one secure phone for my banking apps. If this one gets old I'll recycle it with a different ROM. I don't like the 4 series with the hole
22:33:19 <GhostSplinterSix> Hole?
22:33:32 <hellow> the camera hole lol
22:34:09 <thomashensel[m]> Oh no the 4 had that horrible chin, the newer ones have stupid holes
22:34:20 <GhostSplinterSix> Alright.
22:34:27 <hellow> get a samsung?
22:35:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> Not for security.
22:35:20 <thomashensel[m]> <hellow "get a samsung?"> Again, need a reasonably secure phone
22:35:37 <hellow> get a Quantum samsung phone
22:35:51 <hellow> they are sold in korea
22:36:11 <thomashensel[m]> Troll elsewhere
22:36:17 <hellow> im not trolling
22:36:19 <hellow> y would i?
22:36:23 <GhostSplinterSix> He's using GrapheneOS. Getting a Samsung device would defeat the purpose.
22:36:32 <hellow> my bad then
22:36:42 <hypokeimenon[m]> thomas: To be fair, I do not believe they are trolling.
22:37:02 <thomashensel[m]> Yeah, true I'm just cranky
22:37:08 <GhostSplinterSix> <hellow "my bad then"> Read the link I shared with you just before.
22:37:12 <hellow> I've heard that the new pixel will be cheaper, maybe thats a gud thing ?
22:37:25 <hellow> yea ik samsung isnt supported
22:37:40 <hellow> raid?
22:37:51 <hypokeimenon[m]> The QRNG chip in their Quantum line does not make a significant difference hellow
22:37:52 <GhostSplinterSix> ?
22:37:56 <hellow> nice raid
22:38:07 <thomashensel[m]> Well next step for me is waiting for  a few new parts to move to a qubes is notebook.
22:38:13 <hypokeimenon[m]> Anyway this is off topic #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
22:39:04 <hellow> noice
22:39:13 <hellow> welcome
22:39:15 <hellow> all
22:41:54 <covid-1984[m]> Where to check right after a random reboot to try to discern why it happened?
22:41:59 <covid-1984[m]> (new pixel 4a)
22:42:30 <duck[m]> my numbers are quantumly random 😎
22:42:43 <hellow> yea thats just cringe
22:42:54 <hellow> jk xd
22:43:04 <hellow> anyways time for me 2 head out, ctrl + w, cya guys it was fun talking to y'all and have a good life
22:43:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> stay safe
22:43:41 <maikeru> gyus, i'd like a few precision before going for a graphene phone. Are google Pixel phone thrustworthy ? I mean no internal backdoor, or hidden things like intel me module ? And also is there a way on grapheneOS to install microG components or similar solutions to benefit of  some  play store apps ?
22:44:17 <maikeru> thanks for any advice
22:44:28 <thomashensel[m]> wow, i would go positively insane if i stayed to long in this channel. People really dont read FAQsanymore
22:45:05 <covid-1984[m]> <maikeru "gyus, i'd like a few precision b"> Do some searches in the chat. This was just discussed earlier today. Then you can ask questions if you think something is unanswered / hard to find.
22:45:21 <maikeru> ok , thank you
22:46:07 <GhostSplinterSix> <thomashensel[m] "wow, i would go positively insan"> 😆
22:46:42 <GhostSplinterSix> <maikeru "gyus, i'd like a few precision b"> Please review the website.
22:48:22 <duck[m]> can we have a thing that says read the faq in big type
22:48:44 <Guest50779> don't need to repeat the same thing over and over
22:48:47 <Guest50779> just say it once
22:48:53 <thomashensel[m]> i just think the whole techlore drama brought new people to the oS
22:49:10 <maikeru> yes i'll go do that. I was naive to think i could ask question about grapheneOS on grapheneOS irc room. I am too dumb sorry...
22:49:57 <thomashensel[m]> <maikeru "yes i'll go do that. I was naive"> the issue is not asking questions but asking the most frequenlty asked questions that have detailed answers on the webpage my dude
22:49:58 <Guest50779> please don't engage with concern trolls
22:50:06 <Guest50779> doesn't help
22:50:20 <Guest50779> the goal is getting a reaction
22:50:26 <Guest50779> then taking screenshots of that and misrepresenting it
22:50:34 <jpds> maikeru: GrapheneOS wouldn't be targeting Pixel phones if they weren't trustworthy to begin with
22:53:00 <maikeru> that s not a reason to respond like that thomas. just tell go read faq or nothing. The way you're responsding is just a way to give a trauma to those one who try ask a quesiton . bye
22:53:34 <thomashensel[m]> lol
22:54:43 <GhostSplinterSix> 🤔
22:54:58 <thomashensel[m]> do you think i was overly harsh?
22:55:39 <Thatcher[m]> No
22:55:56 <Guest50779> engaging with concern trolls isn't helpful
22:56:07 <Guest50779> getting mad at them just gives them what they want
22:56:09 <covid-1984[m]> I think the random reboot is happening downloading a 1hr video via Barista (instagram downloading app on F-DROID). New Pixel 4a. Anything else I should check?
22:56:52 <thomashensel[m]> covid-1984: do you have enough space on your device left?
22:57:19 <covid-1984[m]> yep 86gb free
22:59:06 <GhostSplinterSix> <thomashensel[m] "do you think i was overly harsh?"> You're fine. 👍
22:59:46 <Guest50779> covid-1984: try to get logs if you can
23:00:05 <Guest50779> covid-1984: is the issue while *playing* a video?
23:00:09 <Guest50779> I'm not familiar with that app
23:00:15 <thomashensel[m]> Ah well, either way, just wanted to give yall a quick thank you for graphene os, if your ever on a german FOSS Conference i'll buy you  a beer
23:00:27 <covid-1984[m]> I was able to reproduce it while doing nothing other than downloading it.
23:00:39 <covid-1984[m]> I should try a third time but first I need to figure out where to find the logs
23:01:53 <thomashensel[m]> db logcat > myfile.log might do the trick
23:02:03 <thomashensel[m]>  * adb logcat > myfile.log might do the trick
23:04:10 <covid-1984[m]> tnx... getting
23:04:36 <thomashensel[m]> no guarantees though, i'm pretty clueless when it comes to android developement
23:06:03 <covid-1984[m]> <thomashensel[m] "db logcat > myfile.log might do "> taking a long time... will leave it for a few more minutes before killing it
23:06:39 <thomashensel[m]> <covid-1984[m] "taking a long time... will leave"> dont expect output
23:06:53 <thomashensel[m]> <thomashensel[m] "dont expect output"> its piped to the myfile.log file
23:06:58 <Pratyush[m]> <covid-1984[m] "taking a long time... will leave"> ah! keep it running once you face the issue then you can close it with may be CNTRL + C.

23:13:58 <Guest50779> well that doesn't indicate any problem
23:14:09 <Guest50779> covid-1984: does it actually *reboot* or does system ui restart
23:14:28 <covid-1984[m]> Sorry, you're right
23:14:33 <covid-1984[m]> I don't actually see the boot screen
23:14:39 <Guest50779> cause it could be it spams stuff to system ui in a way that manages to leak memory or something and get it killed
23:14:41 <covid-1984[m]> It displays GrapheneOS
23:14:51 <Guest50779> yeah that sounds like it manages to kill system ui
23:14:55 <Guest50779> can you try to make it happen and get logs?
23:15:07 <Guest50779> there will be easily available logs if it doesn't actually reboot
23:15:11 <Guest50779> some massive dump of logs
23:15:18 <Guest50779> it'll be a pain to figure out where it starts / ends
23:15:21 <Guest50779> the relevant part
23:15:25 <covid-1984[m]> sure
23:15:34 <Guest50779> cause whatever happens triggers restarting system ui and a bunch of other stuff
23:17:38 <covid-1984[m]> it is a lot of log... can I post the whole thing? Do GOS logs show private info?
23:20:11 <Guest50779> there can be private info in it
23:20:16 <Guest50779> apps are not supposed to log private info
23:20:17 <Guest50779> but they do
23:20:50 <Guest50779> it's also a hard boundary to figure out
23:21:19 <thomashensel[m]> perhaps send it in a private message, don't post it here

23:45:49 <M9thplayer[m]> <jamesbrunet[m] "> <@jamesbrunet:matrix.org> Hey,"> Good luck my dude
23:51:19 <jamesbrunet[m]> And... strcat wins. It's been a few minutes and the battery level has already dropped 10%. Google support in shambles
23:51:48 <Guest50779> jamesbrunet: in general, the purpose of customer support is to misdirect and put blame back on you
23:51:52 <Guest50779> and make you do stuff
23:51:55 <Guest50779> so it's your problem
23:52:03 <Guest50779> and eventually you give up and it's resolved from their POV
23:52:13 <Guest50779> I think it's just a hardware issue with the battery
23:52:16 <M9thplayer[m]> Especially big company support lol
23:52:17 <Guest50779> it'd be fixed with a new battery
23:52:17 <jamesbrunet[m]> Oh, I am very aware, I work in technical support except I do it internally
23:52:24 <Guest50779> it may even be possible to fix it somehow in another way
23:52:32 <Guest50779> the battery state can maybe be reset somehow
23:52:34 <Guest50779> but I don't know how
23:52:39 <Guest50779> and it probably requires some custom weird code
23:52:46 <jamesbrunet[m]> so at least my job is to actually help people... Yeah, I think this one is going back to the manufacturer.
23:52:51 <thomashensel[m]> sounds like the BMS of the battery is broken
23:53:15 <thomashensel[m]> @jamesbrunet if thats an option go for it
23:53:29 <jamesbrunet[m]> Yeah, it's brand new, should be able to return
23:53:49 <jamesbrunet[m]> But maybe I voided the warranty or something by installing grapheneos. We'll see...
23:53:51 <Guest50779> jamesbrunet: could be a hardware issue, could be the state on the battery is corrupted
23:53:54 <Guest50779> jamesbrunet: no you didn't
23:53:57 <Guest50779> doesn't void warranty
23:54:00 <jamesbrunet[m]> Hell yeah
23:54:17 <thomashensel[m]> they might tell u differnlty but in the US and the EU you didnt
23:54:24 <thomashensel[m]> just don't tell them u installed a diffrent os
23:54:39 <jamesbrunet[m]> I'm in Ontario, Canada
23:54:50 <jamesbrunet[m]> but regardless I think I'm good
23:54:56 <jamesbrunet[m]> thanks for your technical know-how
23:55:27 <thomashensel[m]> yeah just try it, there's very likely similar laws in canada. Imagine a car company denying warranty on your frontlights because you changed the brakes
23:56:03 <Guest55058> Hey everyone I tried to install on a Pixel 4a and after running the flash all the phone turned off and will not turn back on. Thanks
23:56:47 <Guest55058> I'm using Arch Linux to install it too if that helps
23:56:54 <thomashensel[m]> Guest55058:  try putting it on a charger for at least half an hour to make sure it's not just an empty battery
23:58:00 <Guest55058> Ok thanks I'll give it a try. I know it was at 67% charge before I started
23:58:44 <thomashensel[m]> in that case try this first https://www.hardreset.info/devices/google/google-pixel-4a/recovery-mode/
23:59:01 <Guest55058> Ok thanks
