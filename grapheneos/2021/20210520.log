03:20:16 <abff> strcat[m]: are they bridged to oftc or something?
03:20:48 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Hulk> They are not

07:32:11 <strcat> abff: we have a #grapheneos channel on libera.chat and oftc to reserve them but not planning on using them atm
07:32:41 <strcat> abff: the bridge from the old matrix rooms was really problematic for matrix
07:32:58 <strcat> so if we make another bridge it needs to work differently, not a bot that has mod powers and kicks idle users
07:33:07 <strcat> would like to get as many people as possible to just use the matrix rooms

10:42:22 <strcat> if enough people are interested in the libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic rooms we'll figure out a leaner way to bridge it without having a bridge bot requiring mod powers in the Matrix room to invite/kick virtual irc users and kick Matrix users for lurking (really bad experience)
10:42:43 <strcat> focusing on the new Matrix rooms though
10:45:22 <aissen> I'm setting up weechat-matrix, and it isn't quite simple
10:45:46 <strcat[m]> it's a bit experimental atm
10:45:54 <strcat[m]> Element is a better experience for now
10:46:07 <strcat[m]> weechat-matrix does work for me
10:46:10 <somenerd[m]> Probably one of the only stable ones
10:46:13 <strcat[m]> it can't handle E2E encryption properly
10:46:14 <aissen> I have used element, but I can never remember my riot.im account(s)
10:48:11 <somenerd[m]> What’s gonna happen to logbot now?
10:49:32 <strcat[m]> we will leave this irc room around
10:49:37 <strcat[m]> we won't have irc bridged / logged anymore
10:50:11 <strcat[m]> we could set up separate logging through Matrix
10:50:11 <somenerd[m]> That’s a bit sad, as logbot has superior search to element
10:50:18 <strcat[m]> well we could always use something else
10:50:21 <strcat[m]> but it won't involve IRC
10:50:29 <strcat[m]> also IRC doesn't get the long messages, etc.
10:50:31 <strcat[m]> so it wasn't perfect
10:50:55 <somenerd[m]> Yeah, the messages usually redirected to something else
10:51:10 <somenerd[m]> (And those messages probably couldn’t be searched)

10:59:25 <Gladox114[m]> what is freenode exactly and why going away from it?
11:00:19 <strcat[m]> Gladox114: a server for an earlier chat protocol (IRC)
11:00:20 <somenerd[m]> Freenode is an irc network
11:00:25 <somenerd[m]> *server
11:00:29 <strcat[m]> this room is bridged to it, and is an old version of the Matrix room protocol
11:00:50 <Gladox114[m]> what benefit do we get from the new Matrix protocol
11:01:02 <strcat[m]> should join #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org + leave these old rooms (and if people really don't want to use Matrix, we have #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic on libera.chat)
11:01:28 <strcat[m]> Gladox114: assorted bug fixes and improvements, main thing is getting away from this bridged room where Matrix users who don't send a message for 30 days are kicked, that's not an issue in the new rooms
11:01:38 <somenerd[m]> Could make this channel private?
11:01:49 <somenerd[m]> Wait, is it?
11:01:54 <strcat[m]> it's no longer publicly listed
11:02:07 <strcat[m]> want to continue allowing people to join because XMPP bridges, etc. dynamically join/leave
11:02:12 <strcat[m]> so they won't have seen this stuff
11:02:14 <strcat[m]> if they weren't here
11:02:21 <strcat[m]> O
11:02:56 <strcat[m]>  * I'm just going to keep spam pinging the room until people move to the new Matrix rooms (ideally) and/or libera.chat #grapheneos and #grapheneos-offtopic (but we aren't really going to be using those, please use the Matrix rooms)
11:03:27 <strcat[m]> just join #grapheneos-new:matrix.org and #grapheneos-offtopic-new:matrix.org + leave these rooms so you don't get pinged anymore
11:03:52 <strcat[m]> the old aliases were moved over too (don't actually need the -new suffix) but some Matrix clients and home servers cache the aliases

13:50:55 <strcat[m]> we don't want to use the previous bridge approach

13:51:42 <strcat[m]> we might make a bridge, eventually, but it won't work the same way (it won't have mod powers in the Matrix room and won't make a Matrix user for each IRC user or vice versa on IRC)

14:03:49 <aissen> strcat[m]: you said on twitter that a matrix channel did not really belong to its server, but what happens if the matrix.org server shuts down ? Or another (hostile) server is put at the same domain ?
14:04:02 <aissen> how distributed is it ?
14:06:54 <strcat[m]> aissen: the room keeps working fine
14:07:11 <strcat[m]> aissen: the only control matrix.org has over this room is the fact that admins/mods are *currently* using it but we can switch at any time
14:07:27 <strcat[m]> I plan to eventually make a grapheneos.org server for developers, etc. to use (not anyone else)
14:07:39 <strcat[m]> simply join from an account there, make it an admin here, done
14:07:55 <strcat[m]> aissen: rooms are not tied to a server, rather they are synced across servers, and matrix.org going down wouldn't interfere
14:08:09 <strcat[m]> it would be good to have a backup admin account on a 2nd server
14:08:42 <strcat[m]> aissen: so, your account is tied to a particular server, but not rooms, and you can self-host which just works without needing permission to federate (for most servers)
14:08:53 <aissen> so, it's more important to choose the server your account is tied too, because it could lie about what is being sync-ed ? Or pretend to "admin" a channel from another server ?
14:09:27 <strcat[m]> aissen: yes, although there's end-to-end encryption support, which Element enables by default for direct messages and non-public rooms
14:09:32 <strcat[m]> which includes authentication
14:09:34 <strcat[m]> and forward secrecy
14:10:09 <strcat[m]> Matrix is a solid replacement for most uses of GPG and email since it's good at file transfer
14:10:13 <aissen> interesting, thanks.
14:10:31 <strcat[m]> it has a nice easy verification mechanism and cross-signing support
14:10:51 <strcat[m]> so you can verify your own sessions with that mechanism and then when people verify once with you they can get all your sessions verified
14:11:02 <strcat[m]> it works really nicely with Element now
14:11:40 <strcat[m]> you can also do manual verification too which is useful in some edge cases
14:21:54 <strcat> aissen: also a way to deal with migrating account is you would invite your new account to each room / DM (they can become rooms, you can happily turn a DM into a group private room, public room, etc.)
14:22:24 <strcat> there might be some tooling to export stuff and migrate
14:22:26 <strcat> dunno
14:23:01 <strcat> aissen: it's not fully decentralized but rather there are hubs of people synced together, with rooms just being a concept they sync between them, not on a specific server
14:23:19 <strcat> and you can self-host
14:27:10 <alex-resist> Is matrix.org Tor-friendly?
14:27:32 <alex-resist> That would actually be an advantage over Freenode
14:31:22 <dazinism> alex-resist: not sure about matrix.org, but there are/have been tor friendly public matrix servers
14:35:15 <alex-resist> dazinism Ok, I guess I will have to try it out. I really really really don't want to have *another* messenger, but perhaps it can replace something else over time. I'm really experiencing "messenger overload". And they're all so bloated...
14:35:47 <alex-resist> It's really an unfortunate situation
14:36:35 <hexa-> ultimately only your homeserver needs to be tor friendly to be able to participate in matrix
14:36:50 <alex-resist> Yes, but I don't want to set up another home server. I have enough
14:40:49 <strcat[m]> alex-resist: you can happily use Element as an IRC client, it's Matrix -> IRC that's lossy, not so much the other direction
15:09:47 <alex-resist> strcat that means Matrix can also do "pure" (i.e. unbridged) IRC?
15:10:03 <alex-resist> I guess I just have to try it out

15:40:12 <strcat> neelix: so, you can join the libera.chat channel but I'd recommend using Matrix, that channel is going to be really dead for the time being until eventually we add a bridge, and the bridge wouldn't be as fancy as the one here, since it comes with serious drawbacks and screw up the Matrix side
15:41:31 <neelix> Ok thanks strcat
15:41:58 <Elementoshi[m]> Element is the flagship client for Matrix, it's got all the features but it's a bit resource heavy, so there's a list of clients if you want to choose which client you prefer. https://matrix.org/clients/
16:01:19 <Elementoshi[m]> I'm trying to drop my nickserv account, how do I list nicks that I previously grouped?

16:03:50 <strcat[m]>  /msg nickserv help
16:04:31 <strcat[m]> copenhagen_bram: I'd overwrite your email and password, and then drop it I guess?
16:05:14 <strcat[m]> I don't really care cause my pass is just some random alphanumeric string from /dev/urandom and they can have my email address
16:05:32 <strcat[m]> intend to stay around on freenode pining people to join new rooms indefinitely basically
16:07:27 <Elementoshi[m]> Oof, I already used info, dropped my account, and didn't think about overwriting my email or password
16:09:49 <strcat[m]> oh well
16:10:04 <strcat[m]> it might already end up overwritten anyway
16:10:06 <strcat[m]> don't know how the code works
16:10:34 <strcat[m]> but if you want best chance of deleting data you should always set it to a string of same length (length in UTF-8 bytes, not visible characters)
16:11:10 <strcat[m]> so if password is password123 then set to aaaaaaaaaaa
16:11:13 <strcat[m]> it may not overwrite
16:11:18 <strcat[m]> they probably also have database backups...
16:11:27 <strcat[m]> you can't really do much about the fact they likely have backups
16:11:38 <strcat[m]> I mean it'd be pretty concerning if they didn't have backups
16:12:08 <strcat[m]> but hopefully they rotate them so after a month or so if you overwrote the data it's gone (deleting data should cause that too but it might linger there longer)
16:12:43 <strcat[m]> it'd be pretty common for there to intentionally or accidentally be indefinite backups lingering in certain old computers, drives, etc.
16:12:49 <strcat[m]> you can't really do much about it
16:32:40 <rawtaz> the trick is to set your password to the least likely number of a's
