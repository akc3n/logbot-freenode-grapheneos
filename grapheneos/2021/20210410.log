00:00:42 <backupaccmovedto> why does lineageos require a unlocked bootloader but grapheene os?
00:00:42 <backupaccmovedto> whats the difference here?
00:00:44 <kradav[m]> <Felix[m]4 "Well for starters, it doesn't in"> it does not require unlocked bootloader
00:01:19 <chile09[m]> I don't support it I'm just asking because I know GrapheneOS is the gold standard
00:01:45 <TheJollyRoger> backupaccmovedto: So, with respect to unlocked bootloaders, that's actually at the discretion of the phone's vendor, not you.
00:01:46 <natopon> > <@fluffycheese:matrix.org> why does lineageos require a unlocked bootloader but grapheene os?
00:01:46 <natopon> > whats the difference here?
00:01:46 <natopon> Graphene follows reference design of security
00:01:52 <strcat[m]> backup acc; moved to @java:furry.lol: I suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/features and the other documentation if you want to understand the purpose / design of GrapheneOS
00:02:00 <Felix[m]4> <kradav[m] "it does not require unlocked boo"> As far as I'm aware you shouldn't lock the bootloader in LineageOS
00:02:04 <natopon> Nothing stops you from using graphene on locked bootloader though
00:02:16 <vata0[m]> I’m natural I don’t have a dog in either fight
00:02:33 <strcat[m]> a finished GrapheneOS installation needs it to be locked so that verified boot, etc. are active
00:02:36 <TheJollyRoger> Google actually pays extra attention and developer time and possibly extra money to allow their phones' bootloaders to be rekeyable with full hardware security features.
00:02:42 <strcat[m]> it's not really an option but rather part of finishing the installation
00:02:58 <strcat[m]> I do not think we need to go through the stuff that's included on the site
00:03:01 <TheJollyRoger> this allows full hardware security features such as verified boot, attestation, hardware backed keying, and hardware backed keystore to be used with operating systems that aren't the vendors.
00:03:06 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/features
00:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> *aren't the vendor's.
00:03:10 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq
00:03:44 <TheJollyRoger> Other handsets don't give you that opportunity, and in fact, some OEMs like Samsung are actually hostile to it and include E-Fuses that get blown if you attempt to unlock the bootloader, and forever display warning messages if you do.
00:03:54 <backupaccmovedto> <strcat[m] "backup acc; moved to @java:furry"> i get it
00:04:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> <kradav[m] "i wouldnt say, that it caters to"> Could you summarise some of the quality of life features you're thinking about in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ? I'm a little curious.
00:04:47 <strcat[m]> backup acc; moved to @java:furry.lol: I'm unsure what you're referring to and it doesn't seem to be about GrapheneOS
00:05:22 <backupaccmovedto> probably, i dont think i will get the answer to my question
00:05:22 <backupaccmovedto> it might be that i miss understood a statement of another member of this chat
00:06:57 <TheJollyRoger> This is preciesly why GrapheneOS only targets devices that have first class support for non-vendor operating systems. Lineage never prioritized this, and to this day still use Google's connectivity servers, Google's fallback for DNS, and it varies by build: not all versions fully remove google apps that aren't a part of Play Services. This "LineageOS is ungoogled" trope is a myth.
00:07:20 <strcat[m]> I do not think this is an appropriate topic for this channel
00:07:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir.
00:07:39 <TheJollyRoger> Further questions I'd like to redirect to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
00:08:22 <ahmouse> Sorry I should clarify
00:08:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, ahmouse?
00:09:23 <ahmouse> I heard the oneplus 6t isn't supported by graphene because secure boot is broken
00:09:50 <ahmouse> However I haven't been able to find any more info on that
00:10:30 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
00:10:38 <strcat[m]> device support is covered in detail there
00:10:57 <strcat[m]> verified boot is far from the only thing that needs to be properly implemented and not disabled when using an alternate OS
00:11:14 <strcat[m]> and just because a device meets the minimum requirements (which that certainly does not) wouldn't mean it would be supported
00:11:29 <strcat[m]> in order to be supported the device needs an active, committed maintenance/development team
00:12:01 <strcat[m]> because this is a production OS, not a hobby project, and it is not acceptable to have an officially supported device that is not secure, not fully functionality, not supported in the long term, etc.
00:12:17 <TheJollyRoger> There also needs to be dedicated maintainers available for it; I would estimate the cost for a paid maintainer to be roughly $100k per annum, since remember, people who know how to maintain devices generally go work for Android OEMs and get paid big bucks for it.
00:12:18 <strcat[m]> support for a device cannot simply be dropped if people lose interest in it
00:12:36 <ahmouse> Yeah I was planning to have a private fork whilst learning more about android
00:12:44 <kradav[m]> wasnt the main reason, for not supporting oneplus phone, that they have inconsistent update schedule?
00:12:50 <ahmouse> And slowly port over features for myself
00:12:53 <strcat[m]> and each device is a substantial burden for the project as explained there due to needing to do extensive device-specific research, hardening work and debugging upstream bugs
00:13:03 <strcat[m]> kradav: there are a bunch of reasons it is not a viable candidate for GrapheneOs
00:13:03 <TheJollyRoger> ahmouse: That'd be awesome!
00:13:08 <strcat[m]> it does not have proper support for alternate OSes
00:13:22 <vata0[m]> I graphene is open source but what is the licenseing
00:13:23 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have proper security updates, and those cannot be provided without that support
00:13:32 <vata0[m]> * I know graphene is open source but what is the licenseing
00:13:44 <strcat[m]> vata0: https://grapheneos.org/faq#copyright-and-licensing
00:13:51 <vata0[m]> Thx
00:14:12 <ahmouse> In what way are the oneplus security updates improper?
00:14:17 <strcat[m]> MIT, Apache 2, BSD licenses, etc. primarily other than Linux kernel and the Java standard library
00:15:22 <strcat[m]> ahmouse: the device does not support all the required security features, it has missing security features if you use an alternate OS, and it does not have reliable full security updates every month
00:15:30 <strcat[m]> ahmouse: please see https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
00:15:31 <strcat[m]> read that first
00:15:59 <bbc49> Hi
00:16:24 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy bbc49!
00:16:42 <bbc49> Nice
00:16:47 <bbc49> Where u from
00:18:42 <chile09[m]> Is Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G
00:18:51 <chile09[m]> SoC
00:19:14 <strcat[m]> unclear what you're asking about
00:19:31 <chile09[m]> Google Pixel
00:19:43 <TheJollyRoger> bbc49: This channel is topical to GrapheneOS, it's not a meetup/general socializing channel.
00:19:43 <strcat[m]> yeah, I'm unsure what you're asking
00:20:15 <chile09[m]> baseband firmware is closed but memory access is limited
00:20:21 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G is indeed a system on chip, which the Google Pixel uses. What about it?
00:21:11 <TheJollyRoger> That's correct; host memory access is virtualized via system memory management. The peripherals (GPU, Radios, SSD, modems, etc) can only read to or write to memory explicitly allowed to by the driver in the kernel.
00:21:29 <chile09[m]> GrapheneOS is using firmware features and drivers made by Qualcomm
00:21:30 <TheJollyRoger> All the drivers on the Pixels are open source.
00:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> Even the late-stage bootloader, which acts as a root of trust for the operating system, is open source.
00:22:56 <Stephen[m]> Has anyone else had lockup issues with SystemUI? I am trying to determine if its my apps that I have installed which are causing the issue
00:23:08 <chile09[m]> radio driver can't access user space memory
00:23:13 <TheJollyRoger> Stephen[m]: I haven't had any lockup issues with the SystemUI.
00:23:41 <chile09[m]> but code is C/C++ not memory safe like Rust
00:24:06 <Stephen[m]> Its quite random, perhaps while I listen to music, newpipe, vanadium, etc. I'm on a 3XL
00:25:17 <strcat[m]> Stephen: it's known that there's some kind of upstream bug with SystemUI when handling an app ANR
00:25:26 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: So, something you should be aware of: even if you did rewrite the entire Kernel and driver in Rust, you'd need to disable Rust's memory safety features in order to talk to the hardware directly and manage memory. Simply writing something in Rust is not going to be a magical silver bullet against poor design or poor coding developer practices.
00:25:27 <strcat[m]> we don't know where to start with resolving it
00:25:42 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS makes the problem occur more frequently seeming due to uncovering bugs in apps via hardening features
00:25:43 <TheJollyRoger> *and all its drivers in Rust
00:25:55 <strcat[m]> and SystemUI currently handles some situations badly (upstream bug) and wrongly locks up just because the app did
00:25:56 <strcat[m]> it's strange
00:26:48 <Stephen[m]> Sounds related. I know someone showed me how to capture a bug report, so I will see what I can find if it occurs again
00:27:00 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome, Stephen[m]!
00:27:36 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: So, something you shoul"> thanks for sharing
00:28:50 <Stephen[m]> <strcat[m] "and SystemUI currently handles s"> At first I thought it was like a resource thing, but the app not responding would make sense
00:29:43 <strcat[m]> Stephen: it may be because the app has data in zram it needs to be decompressed, etc. that it is not responding but the issue is some kind of bug in SystemUI where the app not responding locks up SystemUI too
00:29:47 <strcat[m]> which shouldn't happen
00:29:57 <strcat[m]> we could potentially disable zram writeback to resolve it
00:29:59 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Yeah. It's a difficult pill to swallow, but there is really no "magical silver bullet".
00:30:00 <strcat[m]> Stephen: which device are you on
00:30:04 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: what I like to say is this:
00:30:09 <Stephen[m]> <strcat[m] "Stephen: which device are you on"> 3XL
00:30:54 <TheJollyRoger> Take a look at an aircraft. The only way for an aircraft not to crash, is for it not to move. If the aircraft is firmly bolted to the ground, it's not going to crash, but that also means it's not going to fly. If the aircraft is not going to fly it might not be very useful as an airplane.
00:31:55 <TheJollyRoger> So what we do with aircraft, is to pile on and pile on loads and loads of failsafes and redundancies, so that should one system fail, the rest can last us long enough for the aircraft to make it to dry land and make an emergency landing.
00:32:01 <strcat[m]> Stephen: some of our most important security features such as the hardened_malloc slab quarantine use significant amounts of memory so we do create more memory pressure
00:32:04 <strcat[m]> so zram is used more
00:32:14 <strcat[m]> I think all of the issues involving this are present on the stock OS too
00:32:24 <TheJollyRoger> Computers are the same way; the only way for a computer not to be exploited, is for it to not be turing complete. But if a computer is not turing complete, it's no longer a computer, and it won't run programs.
00:32:28 <strcat[m]> we just make it happen more often by using memory for those features
00:32:33 <strcat[m]> creating more zram usage
00:32:38 <strcat[m]> among other things
00:32:51 <strcat[m]> hardening features also fairly often uncover bugs, as part of preventing exploitation of those bugs
00:33:06 <strcat[m]> leading to app aborting, which can then lead to uncovering flaws in the upstream handling of that happening
00:33:21 <TheJollyRoger> So what the approach to computer security is, is generally to pile on more and more layers of sandboxing, more mitigations, more restrictions, in the hope that should there be a hole in one layer, another layer will last long enough for us to fix the hole and continue.
00:33:32 <strcat[m]> so what's happening is we're stressing things more in ways that result in uncovering upstream app and to a lesser extent AOSP OS bugs and hitting them more often
00:33:34 <Stephen[m]> Could definitely be a correlation. Usually I notice it freeze when watching larger resolution videos, for example
00:33:59 <strcat[m]> Stephen: media decoding and GPU drivers are also hot spots for memory corruption bugs which can be uncovered by hardened_malloc
00:34:05 <strcat[m]> as part of preventing them from being exploited
00:34:06 <TheJollyRoger> Rust's memory safety is a nice feature, and indeed the project does plan to use it as a replacement for some things, but unfortunately, it of itself isn't going to be a magic bullet.
00:34:09 <strcat[m]> camera is similar
00:34:35 <Stephen[m]> <strcat[m] "camera is similar"> Ah, makes sense. I have had a couple times it do that, iirc
00:35:30 <Stephen[m]> When I ran qubes os on my PC, I assume a similar type of sandboxing requires more resources, like on graphene in a way?
00:36:06 <CryptGoat[m]> <strcat[m] "@room Copperhead stopped most of"> I have been following both communities for quite some time now as I'm a fan of both projects. At least whenever I'm around the calyxos room I see nothimg but nice people and a fair treatment of GrapheneOS whenever new members join the room and ask about both projects.
00:36:27 <strcat[m]> CryptGoat: because they engage in bullying, harassment and spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS primarily elsewhere
00:36:30 <strcat[m]> not in their own channel
00:36:52 <strcat[m]> and then they point to their channel and compare to ours where they do their raids, and blame us for what they are doing themselves
00:36:58 <strcat[m]> CryptGoat: and I suggest looking through logs
00:37:04 <strcat[m]> you will find that what you claim is not the case
00:37:16 <CryptGoat[m]> Will do.
00:37:22 <strcat[m]> including Nick on multiple occasions trying to portray me as crazy / deranged and participating in bullying
00:37:28 <strcat[m]> along with them supporting people who engage in that
00:38:04 <Stephen[m]> <strcat[m] "including Nick on multiple occas"> Do you think there is a financial motive or incentive behind this
00:38:07 <strcat[m]> Shipp, Seth Simmons and techlore prolifically spread lies / misinformation about GrapheneOS and those are core members of their community
00:38:50 <ahmouse> Damn pointless drama
00:38:58 <strcat[m]> Stephen: yes, absolutely, they want to benefit themselves, just because it is a non-profit org does not mean money is not a motivator since it's not like people do not get salaries and they need money for that and other things
00:39:03 <strcat[m]> like Copperhead, they see harming us as useful
00:39:08 <strcat[m]>  * like Copperhead did, they see harming us as useful
00:39:47 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <ahmouse "Damn pointless drama"> Not our fault the project gets to be target of people who can't accept no as an answer
00:39:58 <strcat[m]> Stephen: and one of the biggest perpetrators is doing it because they are a 'YouTube influencer' and live for the drama/conflict
00:40:04 <ahmouse> So is the founder of graphene still active with it?
00:40:06 <strcat[m]> Stephen: they orchestrated most of this themselves
00:40:26 <strcat[m]> Stephen: but it doesn't change that CalyxOS has been fully supportive of it, actively involved in it and promoting it
00:40:37 <ahmouse> Yeah its unfortunate that some people waste they're lives to spite others
00:40:40 <strcat[m]> and I think the blame lies with the people at the top benefiting from it
00:40:44 <grapheneos_user_> <ahmouse "So is the founder of graphene st"> He's talking right now
00:40:47 <strcat[m]> not their proxies attacking us
00:41:09 <ahmouse> Oh your Daniel strcat?
00:41:13 <strcat[m]> so, my focus is going to be on the people benefiting from it, taking advantage of it and supporting it
00:41:23 <strcat[m]> no on the individual trolls and people who make things up and attack us for them
00:41:37 <strcat[m]> they cannot claim it is not them, they have been directly involved, and welcome those people in their community
00:41:42 <strcat[m]> promote their content and legitimize it
00:41:55 <strcat[m]> and they have actively spread the same kinds of lies and engaged in the same bullying themselves
00:42:27 <strcat[m]> I need our community to start opposing the misinformation they spread about us and start calling out what they are doing / orchestrating
00:43:20 <ahmouse> Isn't there some legal action you could take?
00:43:50 <Stephen[m]> We need like a spot where we can gather evidence to fight for the truth
00:44:17 <strcat[m]> ahmouse: we will probably take legal action, once the Copperhead stuff is resolved
00:44:25 <strcat[m]> not right now
00:44:53 * Stephen[m] uploaded an image: (43KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/JunQZrjwhhXGnEYHjooueIbA/You%20can't%20handle%20the%20truth.jpg >
00:44:55 <Stephen[m]> Sending them memes like
00:45:24 <strcat[m]> the way Element shows images is really obnoxious
00:45:49 <FieryBinary> lol yeah
00:45:57 <Stephen[m]> On the app?
00:46:02 <FieryBinary> At least android
00:46:10 <FieryBinary> Desktop Element is actually pretty good
00:53:54 <Lynn[m]> All of the Element clients have a bad UX, but I'd rather use it than Discord.
00:54:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> <Lynn[m] "All of the Element clients have "> Can't agree more to this
00:55:09 <Mathijs[m]> Have you looked at fluffychat?
00:55:22 <Lynn[m]> <Lynn[m] "All of the Element clients have "> I mean millions of users use Element. Which is quite impressive for a federated network like this.
00:56:12 <Stephen[m]> I'll take it over discord, it sounds like they are being bought by microsoft
00:56:28 <Stephen[m]> discord that is
01:17:30 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> I’ll rather use Telegram
01:20:25 <dhsjwbbsjxndbs> The UX is best of all
01:33:25 <jj1013[m]> <dhsjwbbsjxndbs "The UX is best of all "> Off-topic.
01:35:40 <idkrn[m]> are there plans for graphene on non pixels? I don't want to buy google products
01:36:30 <ahmouse15[m]> I think the plan is to eventually produce their own phones, but until then google phones tend to have good security and support
01:37:20 <ahmouse15[m]> So if another phone comes along that's better then it will be used, for the meantime most likely google only
01:37:25 <Stephen[m]> <idkrn[m] "are there plans for graphene on "> I believe there is a security aspect to the google phone, more secure and unlockable bootloader (i think?)
01:38:08 <idkrn[m]> right, but what about people not on google phones?
01:38:33 <Ninja88> When Graphene is installed on a Pixel does that also replace the bootloader and baseband firmware, or are those separate from the OS?
01:38:54 <Stephen[m]> well, problem is that like a lotta phones now, you cant unlock the bootloader (carriers locking them down) and you basically gotta reprogram everything to work on those other devices
01:39:24 <idkrn[m]> so calyx doesnt need an unlocked bootloader?
01:39:55 <Stephen[m]> not sure exactly, i assume it does
01:40:46 <Stephen[m]> I think the main reasoning is for security. you basically have to deal with a whole new level of security problems
01:41:19 <strcat[m]> idkrn: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support and https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1356385317952102400 (the thread, not just that one tweet)
01:41:54 <strcat[m]> Stephen: there is a lot more to it than that, it was just discussed earlier
01:41:55 <strcat[m]> scroll up
01:42:03 <strcat[m]> or look at the logs, it was discussed a couple hours ago
01:42:09 <strcat[m]> shouldn't be repeated again
01:42:41 <Stephen[m]> ill take a peek. lol, you almost need a bot to answer like discord
01:43:31 <Stephen[m]> then you could compile all the discussions about similar topics into one thing
02:01:49 <Ninja88> Hypothetically if a Pixel has firmware that has been compromised, the only way to mitigate that would be to flash the stock Google image which includes the firmware, then re-install Graphene again correct?
02:20:32 <chile09[m]> Is there a way to structure these types of projects into the total number of lines of code and x% of the codebase is opensource and x% is closed source
02:21:08 <chile09[m]> or we don't know the number of lines in the closed firmware
02:21:36 <chile09[m]> is it even possible to reverse SoC firmware using a clip chip or something
02:25:02 <private99[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Sandboxing cannot be disabled by"> Thanks for you answer. So in this case with the VoIP texing app it would probably be best to limit it to 1 dedicated profile so it cant have no interprocess communication with apps on another  profile
02:30:33 <strcat[m]> > Hypothetically if a Pixel has firmware that has been compromised, the only way to mitigate that would be to flash the stock Google image which includes the firmware, then re-install Graphene again correct?
02:30:37 <strcat[m]> this doesn't make sense
02:30:55 <strcat[m]> the firmware has verified boot like the OS and GrapheneOS includes the same firmware updates
02:31:00 <strcat[m]> there is no reason you would need the stock OS
02:31:06 <strcat[m]> not sure why they left before getting a reply
02:32:54 <ahmouse15[m]> Prolly a mobile web user
02:32:59 <ahmouse15[m]> Times out quickly
02:35:30 <chile09[m]> baseband firmware is closed
02:43:27 <strcat[m]> nearly all hardware and firmware is
02:43:32 <strcat[m]> there's nothing particularly special about that
02:43:42 <strcat[m]> and it's the same place Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are implemented, in the same kind of way
02:43:51 <strcat[m]> it's an isolated chiplet
02:44:03 <strcat[m]> with internal sandboxes for the different radio functionality
02:44:51 <chile09[m]> internal cache
02:45:10 <chile09[m]> on chip memory
02:45:35 <chile09[m]> how do they load firmware binaries to chip in the factory
02:46:00 <chile09[m]> if the chip is segmented by function and has internal memory
02:51:41 <TheJollyRoger> They don't. They let the host operating system handle firmware initialization.
02:53:48 <chile09[m]> how does the host interface with that hardware
02:57:39 <chile09[m]> with a regular mobo BIOS/UEFI is flash to the chip and CMOS battery keeps persistence
02:58:27 <chile09[m]> by host OS do you mean there's another OS like Intel ME CPU microcode
03:00:38 <astronomicallyst> <chile09[m] "with a regular mobo BIOS/UEFI is"> I think the OS is responsible for loading hardware drivers. For example when you install CPU microcode or install GPU drivers on Linux, you normally fetch a package with apt...
03:01:38 <astronomicallyst> <chile09[m] "by host OS do you mean there's a"> GrapheneOS has always-on sandbox.
03:02:19 <chile09[m]> sandbox for userspace data and code?
03:03:05 <strcat[m]> chile09: you're confusing the boot chain / UEFI with peripheral components
03:03:21 <strcat[m]> the baseband is a peripheral sub-processor on the SoC
03:04:23 <chile09[m]> ohhh ok
03:04:52 <chile09[m]> but baseband firmware initialized by OS?
03:05:03 <chile09[m]> or embedded code
03:05:25 <chile09[m]> thanks for knowledge btw

03:26:57 <chile09[m]> Daniel Micay?
03:27:08 <danielrr> Is he famous?
03:27:10 <danielrr> Then sure
03:27:28 <danielrr> ha i just googled
03:27:37 <chile09[m]> yes
03:27:40 <chile09[m]> very
03:28:16 <chile09[m]> freedom Mel Gibson
03:28:26 <danielrr> curious to know how many here build from scratch or use the prebuilt images
03:28:53 <chile09[m]> just check the hash
03:29:06 <chile09[m]> oh you mean verifiable build?
03:29:06 <TheJollyRoger> Everyone here uses the prebuilt images. GrapheneOS is fully reproducible, but you'd need the private keys to reproduce the signatures on the apps and system images.
03:29:33 <chile09[m]> good question
03:29:41 <TheJollyRoger> Only one person in the world has those private keys, and that's Daniel Micay himself.
03:29:41 <chile09[m]> build process attacks
03:29:52 <chile09[m]> sneak in a bad library
03:30:00 <danielrr> ok
03:30:17 <TheJollyRoger> Well, you're more than welcome to audit the build process, libraries, and such, it's all open source.
03:30:30 <danielrr> yeah cool
03:30:36 <chile09[m]> yeah but so hard
03:30:53 <danielrr> so its not possible to produce a binary from the source and run it on a phone?
03:31:08 <chile09[m]> baseband firmware is initialized by OS?
03:31:23 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: grapheneOS has full build instructions.
03:31:31 <danielrr> i found them
03:31:35 <danielrr> there in front of me
03:31:51 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: the firmware for the devices, including the cellular modem/baseband, etc, the radios, is loaded onto the devices by the host operating system.
03:31:51 <danielrr> i was just curiou if anyone built it them sevles to run
03:32:24 <TheJollyRoger> Again, they're isolated by the host, and the host is in control of them since the pixels implement System Memory Management.
03:32:52 <TheJollyRoger> They can only write to or read from memory on the host that the fully open source drivers in the kernel explicitly let them.
03:34:04 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: Generally, the only people doing that are developers. Remember that GrapheneOS is more than just source, it's a full production-quality operating system which is signed, verified, and for a given device, is bitwise identical across every single device of that class.
03:35:03 <TheJollyRoger> So if you have a Pixel 4, once you've completed the installation, the system image you run, will be 100% identical to every single other Pixel 4, right down to the last 1 and 0.
03:35:18 <TheJollyRoger> *every single other Pixel 4 running GrapheneOS
03:36:26 <TheJollyRoger> There's absolutely nothing stopping you from forking the code and doing your own builds, owning your own keys, but you're going to also need to do everything else to get the full experience of GrapheneOS.
03:37:06 <chile09[m]> but baseband firmware is binary blob not source
03:37:07 <TheJollyRoger> That includes provisioning your own keys, running your own build server, your own update infrastructure, your own attestation server for integrity monitoring, and maintaining those forks of the various subprojects with your own keys.
03:37:31 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Most things are. It's signed and verified, so even if you had the source you wouldn't be able to alter it.
03:37:36 <TheJollyRoger> *most things for hardware are
03:37:50 <TheJollyRoger> Even if the firmware was open, what, are you going to delid the chip and examine it with an electron microscope?
03:37:55 <TheJollyRoger> Because that's next.
03:38:41 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to go further, then are you going to go and inspect the masking process at the chip fab? (good luck with that, because that's a closely guarded trade secret)
03:39:08 <danielrr> ok
03:39:19 <danielrr> thank you very detailed response
03:39:22 <danielrr> for*
03:39:24 <danielrr> the*
03:39:49 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: Anytime! Anything else I might be able to answer for you?
03:39:54 <danielrr> so
03:41:07 <danielrr> let me have a think, i have a question but i need to think how to phrase it
03:41:52 <TheJollyRoger> I should stress: whether or not something is open or closed source is orthoganal to how secure and private it is. It's possible for something to be open source and be completely insecure; we learned this the hard way numerous times with OpenSSL.
03:42:09 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Even if the firmware was open, w"> are you talking ROM?
03:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> Unless you go to the beach and go scoop up a bucket of sand, and cast your own CPU, sooner or later, you must trust someone.
03:42:40 <danielrr> good point
03:42:52 <chile09[m]> silicon wafer sand
03:43:01 <danielrr> brb going to beach
03:43:18 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: what I'm saying, is that there's no limit to how far down the rabbithole you can go: I run a Raptor CS Talos II, which has firmware that's open all the way down to the self boot engine, and even the field programmable gate array used for power sequencing has a libre toolchain.
03:43:32 <TheJollyRoger> However, I'm not about to go delid the CPUs to make sure there's no funny business in them.
03:44:10 <TheJollyRoger> Even if I did go delid the CPUs, what's next, am I going to peel back all thirteen layers of tracing on the mainboard and match them against the schematics?
03:44:53 <TheJollyRoger> After that, am I going to go to the chip fabricator to see if the masks they used were open? Probably not, because again, chip manufacturing is a very jealously guarded trade secret.
03:45:16 <danielrr> would you say the pixel's are "safe"?
03:45:22 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: yes.
03:46:05 <TheJollyRoger> At this point in time they have the best security properties of *any* Android device and have the strongest support for non-vendor operating systems.
03:46:33 <TheJollyRoger> At least, until we get our own hardware based on a Qualcomm reference SoC.
03:46:53 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, funny thing... the firmware for them is actually available, if you ask nicely enough.
03:46:57 <TheJollyRoger> It's just not open.
03:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> Nor is it modifiable, because again, the firmware packages are signed and verified.
03:47:32 <TheJollyRoger> *nor is it modifiable without vendor support,
03:47:58 <danielrr> ok
03:48:49 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: Google is extremely forthcoming with support for non-vendor operating systems and goes the extra mile to make full hardware security features available to third-party operating systems, something other vendors simply don't do, or are actively hostile to.
03:49:31 <danielrr> I understand.
03:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> They have the Titan security chip, insider access protection, and every single driver on the Pixels is open source.
03:49:54 <danielrr> what if Google were coerced
03:49:58 <danielrr> e.g. warrant
03:50:07 <TheJollyRoger> That's where the Pixel's secret weapon comes in:
03:50:11 <TheJollyRoger> They'd need your password.
03:50:36 <TheJollyRoger> I'll explain in abstract:
03:51:00 <TheJollyRoger> A very comprehensive overview of the Pixel's disk encryption system is available on the GrapheneOS official FAQ here: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
03:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> However,
03:51:15 <TheJollyRoger> I'll give this in brief:
03:53:26 <TheJollyRoger> Let's say you've got your secret muffin recipe onboard your phone. A Very Determined Adversary wants the secret muffin recipe, so one day when you're out, someone smashes your window, grabs your phone, and takes it to the engineers at Google, and points a gun at their heads to release a malicious firmware update to the Titan security chip that will disable the security features.
03:53:30 <TheJollyRoger> That won't work.
03:54:11 <TheJollyRoger> The Titan security chip will only allow its firmware to be upgraded, if it gets your password.
03:54:12 <phone[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Let's say you've got your secret"> i'm very happy my muffins are safe
03:54:27 <TheJollyRoger> phone[m]: Shiver me timbers, me as well, matey!
03:55:14 <chile09[m]> so beacuse signed binaries and password as a parameter to encryption function can't open without the password
03:55:36 <chile09[m]> no password not plaintext no muffins
03:55:43 <chile09[m]> no*
03:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: the firmware for the security chip cannot be upgraded without the user's password, even if the vendor is trying to betray you.
03:56:56 <TheJollyRoger> They need the vendor to become complicit, *and* they need your password.
03:57:44 <TheJollyRoger> The files on the SSD cannot be decrypted without both the password, and the access tokens contained in the security chip.
03:58:37 <chile09[m]> This is like TPM?
03:58:57 <TheJollyRoger> It's not the same, it's Google's design.
03:59:28 <TheJollyRoger> TPM is a much older technology and doesn't have Insider Access Protection.
04:17:47 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on tight everybody, netsplit coming.
04:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> There we go. Should be back to normal now.
04:39:23 <TheJollyRoger> Matrix just crapped itself again. Sit tight everyone, they'll be back shortly.
04:44:14 <danielrr> sorry I got d/c
04:44:36 <danielrr> TheJollyRoger, i missed your last response sorry
04:44:38 <danielrr> my question was
04:44:51 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy danielrr, yep, what was the last line you got?
04:45:00 <danielrr> what if google were coerced
04:45:08 <danielrr> then d/c'd
04:45:23 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, okay, let me scroll up a bit...
04:45:57 <danielrr> thanks
04:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> So... a very comprehensive overview of the inner workings of the Pixel's disk encryption system is actually on the FAQ.
04:47:25 <danielrr> yep
04:47:27 <danielrr> ok
04:47:38 <TheJollyRoger> However, the Pixels were actually designed with the threat vector of "What if my smartphone vendor is served a warrant?" in mind.
04:47:45 <nahman[m]> How does the security of an iOS device compare to a Pixel running Graphene?
04:47:47 <danielrr> bingo.
04:47:56 <danielrr> that's my lense, so to speak.
04:48:07 <TheJollyRoger> Which is related to the disk encryption system... so I'll just skip the technical... just a sec.
04:48:44 <TheJollyRoger> nahman[m]: the two devices actually are very very close. From an old thread, it was said that it's a very very nuanced conversation and in many respects, both of them trade blows.
04:49:19 <TheJollyRoger> In some areas, the Pixels pull ahead, in some, modern iPhone devices pull ahead.
04:50:01 <grapheneos_user_> <nahman[m] "How does the security of an iOS "> Depends
04:50:03 <grapheneos_user_> Some things iOS does better
04:50:14 <grapheneos_user_> Some things GrapheneOS does better
04:50:17 <TheJollyRoger> So, danielrr, let's say you've got some extremely important, critical information, like your secret muffin recipe on your phone, that some Very Determined Adversary wants.
04:51:04 <danielrr> yep
04:51:21 <TheJollyRoger> One day, this Very Determined Adversary throws a cinderblock through your window while you're asleep, grabs your phone, and makes off with it. They take it to Google, and serve them a warrant and use either legal or extra-legal pressure (such as a gun pointed at their heads) to make them write an update to the Titan security chip that will disable some of its security features, or make it vomit
04:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> up its access tokens.
04:51:46 <grapheneos_user_> nahman: that being said, since iOS idiot proofs heavily...maybe GrapheneOS pulls ahead when idiot proofing isn't considered, though I'm not sure
04:52:04 <TheJollyRoger> Then, they go to your smartphone operating system packager/maintainer and do the same to make them bundle this malicious update, and send it to the phone.
04:52:06 <TheJollyRoger> I'll tell you right now:
04:52:08 <TheJollyRoger> That won't work.
04:52:31 <TheJollyRoger> Because they need one last thing in the picture:
04:52:33 <TheJollyRoger> You.
04:52:38 <grapheneos_user_> Needs passcode right?
04:52:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yep.
04:53:04 <TheJollyRoger> The Titan M security chip will not allow its firmware to be upgraded, even if the firmware update is validly signed, and the OS image is validly signed, if it doesn't have the password.
04:53:13 <nahman[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "nahman: that being said, since i"> I don't know that putting security measures in place to protect user and device can be called idiot proofing. But hey...
04:53:23 <grapheneos_user_> <nahman[m] "I don't know that putting securi"> No
04:53:29 <grapheneos_user_> Not talking about security features
04:53:47 <grapheneos_user_> I'm talking about preventing downloading programs from the internet
04:53:48 <nahman[m]> That's the comparison i was asking for tho
04:53:54 <grapheneos_user_> Only App Store, etc
04:54:24 <TheJollyRoger> nahman[m]: Well, don't forget, a *massive* vulnerability exists between the proverbial keyboard and chair.
04:54:27 <nahman[m]> Apps are not the only potential vunerability
04:54:41 <nahman[m]> Exacto!
04:54:46 <grapheneos_user_> <nahman[m] "Apps are not the only potential "> Yeah but you get my point
04:54:48 <TheJollyRoger> So Apple's philosophy has been that "the user's an idiot, don't let him shoot himself in the foot."
04:54:59 <grapheneos_user_> Which is great, but...
04:55:24 <grapheneos_user_> Taken to an extreme, it's "turn off the computer to be secure"
04:55:41 <nahman[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So Apple's philosophy has been t"> When it comes to making sure shit is secure I'm OK with whatever they want to think
04:55:52 <grapheneos_user_> Nah
04:56:08 <grapheneos_user_> Obviously don't root, change too many default settings
04:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> Well, don't forget,
04:56:42 <nahman[m]> You don't honestly believe everyone installing graphene knows what they are doing
04:56:48 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "Obviously don't root, change too"> But iOS level iIdiot proofing gets suffocating
04:56:56 <grapheneos_user_> <nahman[m] "You don't honestly believe every"> When did I say this
04:57:43 <TheJollyRoger> nahman[m]: At this moment, this is why GrapheneOS is still best left to technical users, because we don't have our own curated app store.
04:57:45 <nahman[m]> <grapheneos_user_ "When did I say this"> You didn't but it's implied by the use of "idiot proof", as if to say people using Graphene know better
04:57:57 <grapheneos_user_> <nahman[m] "You didn't but it's implied by t"> No
04:58:12 <grapheneos_user_> I meant that iOS protects the user from himself
04:58:20 <nahman[m]> <TheJollyRoger "nahman: At this moment, this is "> And why not? It would be awesome
04:58:27 <grapheneos_user_> Not necessarily that iOS users are idiots
04:58:35 <grapheneos_user_> Most probably aren't
04:58:54 <TheJollyRoger> nahman[m]: Because there are only so many developer hours we have at this moment. Help is wanted in developing a first-party app store of curated, first-party apps.
04:59:30 <TheJollyRoger> As well as potentially securing co-operation between third-party app developers, such as FairEmail and Signal.
04:59:44 <nahman[m]> I just find it hard to stomach gauging the two operating systems on user intelligence. There has to be better metrics to provide an example of pros and cons.
05:00:02 <grapheneos_user_> No I never said users of one OS are smarter than the other
05:00:05 <TheJollyRoger> nahman[m]: it's more than that, but that's the most "user-visible" difference.
05:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> As in, what you see from your seat.
05:00:15 <grapheneos_user_> Where are you getting thisnahman
05:00:25 <grapheneos_user_> Where did I say iOS users are dumber
05:00:33 <grapheneos_user_> I just said iOS idiot proofs more
05:00:51 <grapheneos_user_> That's a property of the OS
05:00:54 <grapheneos_user_> not the user
05:01:08 <nahman[m]> > So Apple's philosophy has been that "the user's an idiot, don't let him shoot himself in the foot."
05:01:08 <nahman[m]> Here
05:01:21 <grapheneos_user_> Did you check who sent that
05:01:39 <TheJollyRoger> That was what I said, and that's what a design philosophy, not a reflection on people who use iOS.
05:01:41 <nahman[m]> > nahman: that being said, since iOS idiot proofs heavily...maybe GrapheneOS pulls ahead when idiot proofing isn't considered, though I'm not sure
05:01:41 <nahman[m]> Here
05:01:56 <grapheneos_user_> Again, I said that the OS idiot proofs
05:02:03 <danielrr> ok cool
05:02:11 <grapheneos_user_> I said that's a property of the OSnahman
05:02:14 <nahman[m]> This isn't an attack on anyone I'm just trying to gauge differences
05:02:18 <grapheneos_user_> Not the user
05:02:22 <danielrr> I got that last part from log bot (my server died again)
05:02:24 <grapheneos_user_> <nahman[m] "This isn't an attack on anyone I"> Yes
05:02:35 <danielrr> what if the user can be coerced to give their pin code up
05:02:48 <grapheneos_user_> Part of the difference is that iOS idiot proofs morenahman
05:03:08 <nahman[m]> Again with the idiot thing
05:03:18 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: What if you decide to give your data away?
05:03:32 <grapheneos_user_> nahman: fine how about iOS user proofs more
05:03:37 <grapheneos_user_> Better language?
05:03:45 <TheJollyRoger> nahman[m]: Alright, let me put it in a politically correct way:
05:03:48 <grapheneos_user_> Same concept tho
05:03:54 <danielrr> if my country (Australia) it's an offence to withhold your pin code from the police
05:04:10 <grapheneos_user_> <danielrr "if my country (Australia) it's a"> Wow that is ridiculous
05:04:12 <TheJollyRoger> "iOS is more proactive about removing user judgement from the system."
05:04:17 <danielrr> in*
05:04:30 <danielrr> https://www.nationalcriminallawyers.com.au/can-police-demand-the-password-to-my-phone/
05:04:54 <grapheneos_user_> danielrr: well, all Tor users in the US are put on a list
05:04:56 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: I'm sorry, but there's not much I can do for you there except advise you to find a good lawyer. This is a legal problem, not a technical problem.
05:05:03 <grapheneos_user_> You have good company don't worry
05:05:20 <danielrr> can a protection mechanism be put in place
05:05:31 <danielrr> i.e. a certain pin number wipes the phone
05:05:54 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: No, because that then gets you on charges of destroying/tampering with evidence.
05:06:11 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: if you want to put your data in profiles, then delete them when they're no longer used, that's about as best as I can give to you.
05:06:38 <TheJollyRoger> Once you delete a profile, all the data in it is lost forever.
05:07:25 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS has had an issue open for a duress pin, but nobody has submitted code to get it implemented.
05:07:29 <danielrr> i'm thinking from the perspective of a fleet of phones
05:07:39 <danielrr> and one of those phones is captured
05:07:43 <danielrr> by a nation state
05:07:45 <danielrr> or whatever
05:08:07 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: Well, again, if you write the code, or hire someone else to write the code and submit it...
05:08:09 <TheJollyRoger> Check this out:
05:08:16 <danielrr> so a c&c instance, can wipe the phone
05:08:22 <danielrr> i can write code
05:08:23 <danielrr> yep
05:08:39 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/29
05:08:51 <danielrr> tar
05:08:58 <danielrr> that's gold :)
05:09:12 <grapheneos_user_> Maybe one password unlocks a l1
05:09:22 <danielrr> one password to rule them all
05:09:23 <grapheneos_user_> Typo
05:09:28 <grapheneos_user_> Lol
05:09:29 <danielrr> or something like that
05:10:02 <grapheneos_user_> Maybe one password unlocks a separate profile with innocent data like pictures
05:10:13 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr, note the following:
05:10:18 <TheJollyRoger> > I hope you're prepared for whatever consequences follow as a result. This feature doesn't currently have a design sketched out and there's currently not much reason to think that it would be at all stealthy. It's going to be noticed that the data is being wiped and that the device has been put into a fresh installation state. It will be publicly known that GrapheneOS has this feature, as with
05:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> any other feature, so what happened won't be a secret / unknown question. It would be extremely difficult to provide any kind of plausible deniability for wiping the device, and even deleting a profile would be noticed. Wiping the contents of a profile and logging in to it as a fresh profile is a possibility, but it's going to be noticed that it's a fresh, wiped profile. It's not going to be a
05:10:22 <TheJollyRoger> secret that it was wiped.
05:10:45 <danielrr> ok
05:11:00 <danielrr> I think grapheneos_user_'s suggestion is a good idea
05:11:03 <TheJollyRoger> (That's roughly halfway down the page)
05:11:05 <danielrr> like a dual instance
05:11:26 <TheJollyRoger> Decoy encryption has actually been discussed a lot and shown with Veracrypt, and here's the verdict on it:
05:11:28 <TheJollyRoger> It doesn't work.
05:11:34 <danielrr> ok
05:11:41 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Decoy encryption has actually be"> Well
05:11:46 <grapheneos_user_> Rip
05:11:57 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The problem is that it's one of those features that looks good "on paper"
05:12:17 <grapheneos_user_> Only way is obscurity
05:13:01 <danielrr> i understand
05:13:44 <TheJollyRoger> Decoy encryption might hide something from your kid sister, or a casual inspection from a work supervisor.
05:14:09 <TheJollyRoger> But you're asking for a nation state adversary, and Veracrypt's "hidden volume" function is trivially easy to notice if you have a copy of Autopsy, which you can download for free.
05:14:29 <danielrr> ok
05:14:38 <grapheneos_user_> So depends on threat model
05:14:42 <danielrr> yes
05:15:16 <grapheneos_user_> Let's say some overzealous school employee threatens suspension if you don't unlock your phone/laptop
05:15:26 <grapheneos_user_> They have access to police
05:15:34 <grapheneos_user_> But not nation state level police
05:15:48 <grapheneos_user_> Would it work then?
05:15:59 <TheJollyRoger> Well, I'll meet you halfway:
05:16:12 <danielrr> i'm thinking more the police and their lea advisors
05:16:18 <TheJollyRoger> What if they hire a bored college grad who has a good-quality desktop computer, and has read the Autopsy documentation cover to cover?
05:16:31 <TheJollyRoger> Two words:
05:16:33 <TheJollyRoger> "You're busted."
05:16:39 <grapheneos_user_> True
05:16:50 <TheJollyRoger> Autopsy's free. You can download it and try it out.
05:17:39 <danielrr> is that the sleuth kit?
05:17:44 <danielrr> as in the .org
05:17:55 <TheJollyRoger> Not only that, but now you've opened up an interesting problem: now that this feature is known, and you've just gotten busted for lying in court, how do you convince them that you've actually come clean?
05:18:21 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Not only that, but now you've op"> You don't
05:18:22 <danielrr> we still have right to silence (for now)
05:18:57 <grapheneos_user_> If you're against a nation state you're f ed
05:19:06 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: Yeah. At that point, you could be locked up indefinitely for contempt of court with the judge believing you have the keys to your cell in your pocket if you'd just tell them the next password.
05:19:31 <danielrr> F*ck! Autopsy is 1.2gb
05:19:34 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: Yes, Sleuth Kit, hard drive forensics software.
05:19:38 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "grapheneos_user_pi: Yeah. At tha"> At that point negotiation would be the best option
05:20:03 <danielrr> are any of you guys the devs?
05:20:09 <grapheneos_user_> "I'll give you the password if you drop all charges and send me to international country"
05:20:16 <TheJollyRoger> No, I'm just the channel greeter.
05:20:19 <grapheneos_user_> <danielrr "are any of you guys the devs?"> Not me
05:20:26 <danielrr> kewl
05:20:29 <TheJollyRoger> And someone who sings sea shanties.
05:20:46 <grapheneos_user_> I thought the jolly Roger was the battle flag lol
05:20:57 <grapheneos_user_> Didn't pirates raise it when attacking?TheJollyRoger
05:21:05 <danielrr> remember the anarchist's cookbook from the 80s/90s
05:21:19 <grapheneos_user_> Gunpowder...
05:21:19 <danielrr> wasn't that the author's name?
05:21:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, that's correct; the Jolly Roger was the black flag that pirates raised when they raided other ships.
05:21:59 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: Heh, I'm not that Jolly Roger. There are about 5 different people on Freenode alone that have some variation of the name "Jolly Roger."
05:21:59 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Yep, that's correct; the Jolly R"> Learn from red Rackham lol
05:22:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehe, yes!
05:22:21 <grapheneos_user_> Tintin is amazing
05:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, that's also true: if the pirates raised the red flag, that meant no quarter given.
05:22:23 <danielrr> haha i don't think anyone would ever admin that fact anyway
05:23:06 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Yep, that's also true: if the pi"> Then red Rackham ties haddock to the mast
05:23:14 <TheJollyRoger> I occasionally get asked if I'm the guy behind Silk Road, the Darknet Opsec Guide, and the Anarchist Cookbook, and a gun store somewhere in the United States, but no, this is just a coincidence.
05:23:23 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: Yep! Hehe, man, nostalgia :D
05:23:52 <grapheneos_user_> No one I meet IRL seems to have read it for some reason
05:24:09 <TheJollyRoger> It's a classic!
05:24:15 <danielrr> :)
05:24:31 <danielrr> I doubht you're the silk road dude
05:24:43 <danielrr> unless youve smuggled a smart phone into prison
05:25:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hahaha, yeah. Just, someone asked me that once :P.
05:25:18 <TheJollyRoger> "Jolly Roger" is a very common name in tech it seems.
05:25:19 <danielrr> :)
05:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> And apparently, gun stores.
05:26:36 <danielrr> what does the attestation server do
05:26:44 <danielrr> there's a desc, but i still don't understand it
05:27:11 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: What it does, is it can challenge your phone, and your phone has to attest to its verified boot keys using its hardware backed keystore.
05:27:25 <danielrr> ok
05:27:36 <TheJollyRoger> It can only answer correctly if it is running an unaltered, un-compromised, genuine version of GrapheneOS.
05:27:44 <danielrr> ok
05:27:45 <TheJollyRoger> If the operating system is compromised, or tries to lie to auditor, it can't answer correctly.
05:28:18 <TheJollyRoger> AttestationServer can do this regularly, and then warn you "Something's not right" if your phone fails to check in after a certain amount of time.
05:28:39 <TheJollyRoger> If you've been given counterfeit verified boot keys, attestation will fail.
05:28:53 <danielrr> is that something a customer stands up themselves?
05:29:00 <danielrr> or pings the internet somewhere
05:29:24 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: you could, if you wanted to, but GrapheneOS maintains one in-house which is publicly available.
05:29:30 <danielrr> gotcha
05:29:47 <TheJollyRoger> You would need to fork Auditor and Attestation Server, but you could do it.
05:30:38 <danielrr> ok
05:31:45 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't have the shoulders to maintain your own fork, you can use https://attestation.app/tutorial
05:31:58 <danielrr> ok
05:31:59 <danielrr> tar
05:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> It's really easy to set up, just select remote attestation from the "..." menu in Auditor, and you'll be asked to scan the barcode in your account. Make sure your phone is connected to the internet or it won't work.
05:32:47 <danielrr> ok
05:33:04 <danielrr> do you steer away from traditional voice and sms services
05:34:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Remember that traditional voice and SMS are meant to trust the cell network, which is public. So calls routed through it, are public.
05:34:36 <TheJollyRoger> *calls and texts routed through it, are public.
05:35:15 <danielrr> ok
05:35:16 <TheJollyRoger> Instead, you can simply use a messaging app which offers end-to-end encryption to replace it.
05:35:23 <danielrr> any recommnedations
05:35:27 <TheJollyRoger> Signal.
05:35:46 <danielrr> ok
05:36:07 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that SMS and traditional telephone calls must maintain backwards compatibility to devices that were around in 1986.
05:36:12 <danielrr> yep
05:36:25 <danielrr> what about with respect to tools like sting rays
05:36:49 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: not a problem if you use an instant messaging app like Signal, because Signal is encrypted.
05:37:14 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS *always* treats the network as hostile and all Android apps compiled against a modern version of the API enforce the use of transport encryption.
05:37:21 <TheJollyRoger> Traditional voice calls and SMS are the exception.
05:37:53 <iantucenghi[m]> TheJollyRoger: apologies what is the link for Offtopic?
05:38:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hello iantucenghi[m] you'll find the offtopic channel at #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org via Matrix.
05:38:34 <iantucenghi[m]> Thanks Jolly!
05:38:37 <TheJollyRoger> You're welcome!
05:38:41 <iantucenghi[m]> Something happen to offtopic
05:38:45 <iantucenghi[m]> people got kicked out in mass
05:38:49 <iantucenghi[m]> bridge broke?
05:38:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:38:59 <iantucenghi[m]> Ah okay
05:39:07 <TheJollyRoger> From time to time, freenode suffers a netsplit when one server stops talking to another.
05:39:15 <TheJollyRoger> Matrix's bridge broke at roughly the same time.
05:39:27 <iantucenghi[m]> Dang not so cool
05:39:36 <iantucenghi[m]> Hey, how's the alternative to FDroid going?
05:39:38 <TheJollyRoger> Usually these outages only last for a couple minutes but everyone who's on the wrong side usually shows up as being kicked out or leaving (depending on which side you're on)
05:39:56 <iantucenghi[m]> I am in Matrix
05:40:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
05:40:06 <iantucenghi[m]> so a bit stable
05:40:13 <iantucenghi[m]> if in matrix that is
05:40:35 <TheJollyRoger> Occasionally the bridge from Matrix to IRC can break in weird ways, and this is what likely caused you to get disconnected.
05:45:02 <TheJollyRoger> Aaaargh! Like what's going on now.
05:45:07 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on tight everyone.
05:46:07 <iantucenghi[m]> Okay
05:46:14 <TheJollyRoger> 1083... I think almost everybody's back now.
05:46:30 <iantucenghi[m]> Yeah
05:46:33 <iantucenghi[m]> looks like it
05:47:36 <danielrr> apologies for asking twice, just wondering if my last Q got through prior to the split
05:47:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hey danielrr, what was your last question?
05:47:47 <danielrr> what about with respect to stringrays
05:48:20 <TheJollyRoger> One moment:
05:49:15 <TheJollyRoger> danielrr: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210410#c7574434
05:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> "GrapheneOS always treats the network as hostile."
05:49:35 <danielrr> ok
05:49:56 <danielrr> what does that exactly mean tho
05:50:36 <TheJollyRoger> It means that with the exception of traditional voice calls and SMS GrapheneOS doesn't trust the network and assumes that bad people are always listening on the cell and wifi network.
05:51:03 <danielrr> ok
05:51:50 <danielrr> if you have no choice but to connect to services
05:52:07 <danielrr> 4g 5g or whatever
05:52:07 <TheJollyRoger> What do you mean "no choice?" Connecting to services is the *point* of owning a smartphone, man.
05:52:16 <danielrr> i get that
05:52:25 <danielrr> but, so you're in a car park full of people
05:52:39 <danielrr> and one of them has an imsi catcher in their pack
05:52:43 <danielrr> walking around collecting intel
05:53:10 <danielrr> will you be notifieid (or protected against)
05:53:12 <danielrr> something like this
05:53:17 <danielrr> i know its a hard question to address
05:53:48 <TheJollyRoger> Then they won't get anything useful because unless you're browsing websites from the 1990's that don't have encryption (in which case Vanadium will display a big fat "NOT SECURE!!!"), or using legacy phone calls or SMS, all of that is encrypted.
05:54:29 <danielrr> what about the collection of actualy IMSIs
05:54:53 <danielrr> can you whitelist base stations?
05:55:01 <TheJollyRoger> That wouldn't work.
05:55:14 <TheJollyRoger> Because they'd just lie to you about what stations are where.
05:55:19 <danielrr> ok
05:55:51 <TheJollyRoger> Again, it's far better to have the base network be security agnostic,
05:55:55 <danielrr> i'm thinking about imisi collection which can then passed onto a provider to identify invidiauls
05:55:56 <TheJollyRoger> and use something like TLS.
05:56:01 <TheJollyRoger> Use Airplane mode then.
05:56:07 <TheJollyRoger> And turn your WiFi on.
05:56:08 <danielrr> ok
05:56:26 <TheJollyRoger> Airplane Mode will completely stop your phone from contacting the cellular network.
05:56:33 <danielrr> so in high threat environments, best best it to Airplane mode?
05:56:46 <danielrr> and hold off entirely
05:56:49 <TheJollyRoger> But you *can* switch your WiFi back on and use WiFi.
05:57:01 <TheJollyRoger> If you don't want your cellphone to contact the cellular network, use Airplane Mode.
05:57:52 <danielrr> ok
05:58:24 <TheJollyRoger> Note that turning off Cell Data is only intended to save you money by limiting data use, while still allowing you to use SMS and voice calls, but Airplane Mode actually stops the radio from contacting the cellular network.
05:58:27 <TheJollyRoger> That's the difference.
05:58:45 <TheJollyRoger> In both cases, you can still rely on your WiFi.
05:58:46 <danielrr> ok
06:00:16 <TheJollyRoger> I usually turn Cell Data off if I've used about 80% of my data allotment.
06:00:26 <TheJollyRoger> So that way I can save the last 20% of my data.
06:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> (In case I need it)
06:04:41 <TheJollyRoger> Time to catch some Z's. Fare thee well, shipmates.
06:05:33 <akc3n[m]> Nighty night
06:09:12 <pako> Youtube app is  not working for graphene?
06:09:26 <pako> I cant install youtube, gmail?
06:11:04 <strcat[m]> you can install them, the apps may not work without Play services though
06:11:25 <strcat[m]> there is NewPipe which is an open source frontend for YouTube bypassing their restrictions like disallowing playing videos in the background without paying for premium
06:11:35 <strcat[m]> you can use another mail client for gmail
06:23:03 <pako> the only applications that do not work by not having google services would be google's own right? maps, chrome, youtube, drive and gmail?
06:28:50 <strcat[m]> no
06:28:59 <strcat[m]> some of those like Maps do largely work without Google Play services
06:29:08 <strcat[m]> and many other apps choose to have a hard dependency on Google services
06:29:14 <strcat[m]> via Play services
06:29:15 <strcat[m]> unfortunately
06:29:20 <strcat[m]> sometimes just for certain functionality
06:29:35 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#notifications has information on apps using Google servers to do notifications
07:07:04 <private99[m]> Hey
07:07:04 <private99[m]> My wikr is not giving notifications about messages until I sign in most of the time. I have checked wikr notification settings to see and they're on.
07:07:04 <private99[m]> Is there some system settings I'm supposed to change ? Or does wikr have spotty notifciations sometimes
07:32:09 <akc3n[m]> private99:  Hi. I personally do not use wickr. However, just thought I'd ask, have you checked GrapheneOS's system settings -> apps and notifications ->  wickr?
07:32:09 <akc3n[m]> Also this may help with explain how notifications work on GrapheneOS:

08:04:20 <private99[m]> I'll keep checking for a solution
08:06:18 <lasf9af> Hi, my F-Droid App seems to have some issues. It regular exhibits a behaviour where it simply stops displaying apps. Clearing the storage usually fixes this issue, but requires re-installing all repositories afterwards, which gets fairly tedious. Does anyone happen to know the reason for this?
08:06:19 <lasf9af> Thanks!
08:07:08 <helloworldkk87[m> I had similar problems with fdroid. Now I use FoxyDroid and its so much better
08:08:06 <akc3n> private99[m], okay sounds good. Hope you find your answer, I'll keep searching too.
08:09:26 <lasf9af> Is FoxyDroid safe?
08:11:25 <helloworldkk87[m> <lasf9af "Is FoxyDroid safe?"> Yes it is
08:12:21 <lasf9af> Sorry for the question, but I'm new to this. Is it correct that FoxyDroid is simply a different client for the same repository?
08:12:35 <lasf9af> So the apps come from the same source, only the client is different?
08:14:11 <helloworldkk87[m> Yes its F-Droid client
08:14:11 <helloworldkk87[m> You can get it from F-Droid
08:14:30 <blacklight447[m]> https://preyproject.com/
08:15:36 <lasf9af> Ok thanks. How would I know the client doesn't tamper with the apps it downloads? Is there any way to verify them?
08:16:19 <j-james[m]> You'd look through the source code of Foxy Droid, basically
08:16:21 <helloworldkk87[m> Foxydroid verifys them for you just like fdroid does
08:16:42 <helloworldkk87[m> Anf aurorastore
08:16:51 <helloworldkk87[m> * And aurorastore
08:20:19 <blacklight447[m]> This should be pretty close
08:20:46 <lasf9af> Has Foxy Droid been audited? Unfortunately I don't know enough to look through the code myself
08:23:16 <helloworldkk87[m> I dont know, its has been sugested in GrapheneOS rooms over fdroid tho due to them targeting newer API and cleaner UI
08:23:37 <helloworldkk87[m> Also there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:24:18 <helloworldkk87[m> Because this is kinda off topic
08:27:48 <lasf9af> Ok, sorry about that. I'll take this to offtopic. Thank you so much for your help!
08:28:44 <stencil[m]> The search in matrix is garbage, remember to only use logbot
08:29:50 <helloworldkk87[m> :D
08:36:39 <arcibald[m]> <TheJollyRoger "arcibald: There aren't. We recom"> Is there any other safe and secure way to disable some features / restrict some policies on device? Also, is there way to update some apps remote on my and my family/employess phones?
09:12:16 <arcibald[m]> To be precise: I want to disable gps, voice calls, sms, etc. I want to allow only few apps for use. Is that possible on GOS and what is best way to do that?
09:13:51 <kayront> afaik just disable location and enable airplane mode arcibald[m]. you can enable wifi even with airplane mode
09:15:43 <arcibald[m]> No, I want to disable wifi also. :)
09:15:43 <arcibald[m]> Phones will have sim (or e-sim) with data plan.
09:20:07 <kayront> then just airplane mode
09:20:35 <kayront> if you mean only data connection (no voice/sms), then I am not sure how
09:27:31 <rhythm[m]> <pako "I cant install youtube, gmail?"> Either use newpipe or YouTube venced
09:30:15 <bluec[m]> Or SkyTube

10:34:43 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: you shouldn't be using developer options
10:34:50 <strcat[m]> developer options are for developers and don't do what you think
10:34:55 <strcat[m]> if you've changed those you probably caused issues
10:35:06 <strcat[m]> make sure all that is set back to how it was, factory reset if necessary
10:35:21 <strcat[m]> the USB driver you're talking about is for adb/fastboot on Windows not any of this
10:35:29 <strcat[m]> it is unclear what you're trying to do
10:35:40 <strcat[m]> using developer options is not a way to do it
10:35:46 <joeth[m]> morimorisan: I know it sounds stupid but did you unlock the phone before checking the notification?
10:36:06 <joeth[m]> it could be that you're trying to enable MTP from the lockscreen
10:36:46 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: hard to provide support if you have used adb and other developer options settings
10:37:22 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: file transfer between phone and computer is a totally different thing from using USB peripherals and neither involves developer options
10:37:42 <strcat[m]> for file transfer with a computer the normal approach is plugging it in, unlock if you haven't already, and select file transfer as the mode in the notification
10:38:02 <strcat[m]> if you have messed with developer options then that may be broken from your changes, don't know what you have done
10:38:10 <arcibald[m]> strcat Can you help me or give me your suggestion?
10:38:12 <strcat[m]> default mode is supposed to be charging because you authorize file transfer
10:38:47 <arcibald[m]> To be precise: I want to disable gps, voice calls, sms, etc. I want to allow only few apps for use. Is that possible on GOS and what is best way to do that?
10:38:52 <strcat[m]> arcibald: I don't know what you want to do, you have the permission manager options in Settings already, and there is a global location toggle too
10:39:12 <morimorisan[m]> <strcat[m] "morimorisan: you shouldn't be us"> Thank you, Yes, I was very confused then I tried many Irrelevant solutions.
10:39:34 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: plug in phone to computer -> enable file transfer in notification
10:39:41 <arcibald[m]> Ok, I will check that. Thank you. Is there way to push update for some specific app remote?
10:39:42 <strcat[m]> USB peripherals is a totally different thing, unrelated to that
10:40:25 <strcat[m]> for USB peripherals, GrapheneOS only permits the ones connected at boot (so are connected before it's unlocked at all) or while unlocked
10:40:45 <joeth[m]> <arcibald[m] "Ok, I will check that. Thank you"> you could use ADB over network but that would basically allow an open backdoor on your phone if you leave it on, definitely not recommended haha
10:40:45 <strcat[m]> not related to using the phone itself as a USB peripheral for a computer
10:40:48 <strcat[m]> has no impact on that
10:41:08 <strcat[m]> arcibald: unclear what you want to do
10:41:42 <strcat[m]> arcibald: it sounds like you want to use a device manager to lock down the phone to disallow the user from doing things
10:41:46 <strcat[m]> so, that is what you should do
10:41:53 <morimorisan[m]> <joeth[m] "it could be that you're trying t"> Thank you. Yes, I unlock the lockscreen every time.
10:42:13 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: you need to enable it in the notification
10:42:19 <strcat[m]> factory reset first if you have changed dev options
10:42:23 <strcat[m]> to make sure that isn't a factor
10:42:50 <arcibald[m]> Thank you, I see that I need to install GOS first and check available options. :)
10:42:50 <arcibald[m]> Will contact you after that.
10:43:44 <morimorisan[m]> <strcat[m] "morimorisan: plug in phone to co"> Yes, I did this.
10:43:58 <joeth[m]> <morimorisan[m] "Thank you. Yes, I unlock the loc"> ah, that's all i know really. I once had a xiaomi phone which had its USB data lines fried, one day I plugged it into a dodgy power brick and suddenly it wasn't detected on any computer and wouldn't recognise flash drives.
10:44:29 <joeth[m]> or it could also be the USB port
10:44:50 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: sounds like it isn't properly connected to the computer, or the OS on the computer doesn't support MTP
10:48:58 <morimorisan[m]> <strcat[m] "USB peripherals is a totally dif"> Thank you. I checked the USB peripherals, but didn't know that I should unlock screen before connecting. But tried, no affect now.

11:03:40 <strcat[m]> morimorisan: not likely at all
11:03:47 <strcat[m]> it's a USB cable issue or driver / OS issue on the computer
11:04:07 <strcat[m]> most likely driver / OS problem

11:07:43 <morimorisan[m]> Thank you. USB cables are almost new those are come with Pixel 4a, then driver/OS issue. I have two windows PCs, but tried many Irrelevant solutions. Maybe both have issue😂. I'll try "System Restore" at first.
11:08:20 <somenerd[m]> >Is there any difference about safety and security between Web based and cmd line based installations?

11:19:02 <jjstopperl[m]> Hi I'm new here. I installed Grapheneos and my bootloader is unlocked. I don't have a lock option. The phone previously had Lineagos. Can I solve this?
11:21:28 <DHFuchsiaOSwhen> Reboot to bootloader interface, go to web installer, connect the phone to PC, then go to this section: https://grapheneos.org/install/web#locking-the-bootloader
11:22:28 <zerodayn0000b[m]> hello, got a quick question, how does grapheneos implements agps/supl? is it degoogled as well?
13:05:37 <Exilion[m]> Hello, not sure if i should ask it here or in Off Topic channel. I have a question to GrapheneOS devs, is it worth to use work-profile sandboxing apps like Shelter or Insular to isolate proprietary apps (for example Spotify, bank apps) or the native hardened sandboxing and premission management is enough for such apps? Thanks a lot!
13:08:18 <helloworldkk87[m> Im not a dev but all apps are sandboxed. Apps only have access to their own sandbox resources. Seperate user profiles, shelter or insular do not offer stronger sandbox
13:09:54 <nscnt[m]> Exilion: It's generally discouraged to use highly privileged apps like the ones you mentioned
13:11:34 <Exilion[m]> Agreed, i see only use for this apps in GrapheneOS - isolate contacts/calendar etc. if app doesn't run without this perm but you dont want to share this info, but in general put trust to controll the whole profile in any app is dangerous. Just wanted to make sure if i understand it right. Thanks again
13:14:22 <nscnt[m]> Exilion: If you want to separate apps and data, you should consider using multiple users. This certainly has its drawbacks. I don't know whether you've already looked into this and concluded that the tradeoffs are too great for your use case
13:15:16 <nscnt[m]> The real question is: What do you want to accomplish?
13:15:20 <cyniara> <Exilion[m] "Agreed, i see only use for this "> You can deny calendar and contacts permission. You can also look into multiple users.
13:16:54 <Exilion[m]> For the moment, prop.apps i need doesn't asking for any unnesesary permission, so it is not relevant for me. But if i'll need it, i will follow your advice and use multiple users feature. Thanks again
13:23:56 <crottor> Hey, is Open Camera the AOSP camera or is it different? If different, I can't find the apk of the AOSP camera, would like to try it on my pixel before installing grapheneos

13:30:26 <Exilion[m]> A few other questions, i know, main focus of Graphene is to improve security and design features are not planned or have lowest priority, but i would like to ask if maybe some of "features" i miss could be realised or at least if i will later make commit/pull request with this features (going to start learning Android system as hobby) would it be implemented (of cours if it will be right coded) ? Following list is
13:30:26 <Exilion[m]> interesting for me (possibility to disable default message app and AOSP keyboard, dark/black theme for phone,messages,contacts,calculator,clock, Launcher grid options, colour picker for system accent colour)
13:30:55 <crottor> nscnt: how do I install AOSP camera app on my pixel OS?
13:32:15 <nscnt[m]> dividend_reklamator: I don't think there's an official apk. The app is built with the system
13:33:42 <crottor> I don't get why it's so hard to find AOSP apps. On apkmirror I can find some lineageos stock apps but even there I can't find the camera stock app
13:36:44 <nscnt[m]> dividend_reklamator: As I said, it's built with the system. It's not meant to be published as an apk in an app store. You can, but it's not meant to be and it wouldn't be an official release of it
13:37:51 <nscnt[m]> dividend_reklamator: You would have to trust the person who builds and signs the app
13:42:41 <crottor> You mean that the stock camera app is more tightly coupled with the system, so it's impossible to build it without having to go through some hoops? If so, why is Open Camera buildable easily although it has more features? Does Open Camera depend on the stock app or do both the stock app and Open camera use a common API?
13:46:27 <danielrr> Does anyone build the code from source?
13:47:50 <nscnt[m]> Exilion: Daniel is the one who decides (well-founded) what is wanted and what is not, so it's better to check with him before you start working on a feature you're making just for GrapheneOS
13:48:44 <nscnt[m]> Exilion: The issue tracker should be your first stop to see what is wanted
13:56:06 <Exilion[m]> <nscnt[m] "Exilion: The issue tracker shoul"> Ok, thanks)

15:00:36 <Xogium> hi guys :) have a few questions, hopefully not going to take much time
15:00:59 <Xogium> my first priority question is… Can I get talkback screen reader working on grapheneos ?
15:03:06 <Xogium> and second is, since I have a pixel 2 xl, can I still flash grapheneos on it and keep it that way ? Google dropped support for it after android 11, and it still works fine for my use right now, but I wonder if using grapheneos would be better, even though its almost unsupported by now
15:03:37 <Xogium> and nop changing phone isn't an option, at least not in the near future
15:05:24 <Xogium> but if there's no support for talkback out of the box in any way I might just be keeping the android 11 from google
15:18:06 <dannyknoll3Danny> This is my second "new to me" Pixel 4 XL that Graphene/(AOSP?) claims to be unable to read the battery meter.
15:18:10 <dannyknoll3Danny> Is this expected/common?
15:32:18 <th0rr[m]> What app is more reccomended for network Tor traffic in GrapheneOS?
15:33:45 <arcibald[m]> <th0rr[m] "What app is more reccomended for"> I am interested in this too. And is there way to force all traffic via Tor network and deny any other connections/leaks?
15:35:12 <th0rr[m]> <arcibald[m] "I am interested in this too. And"> Take a look at InviZible Pro
15:35:53 <arcibald[m]> I will, thank you.

15:44:49 <rosie> So are Xogium and troypatrick the same person?  Or is troypatrick still trying to install GOS?  If you're not finding the device, make sure you're using the USB cable that came with your phone.  If you don't have a USB-C poprt on your computer, try another phone instead.

15:45:11 <Pratyush[m]> it's all right try other port or cable
15:45:48 <rosie> I ended up using my Samsung 8 to install GOS on my Pixel because of that cable issue.
15:45:48 <troypatrick[m]> I have usb c port on my pc and it's working because when I plug my phone in with the default os it detects the pixel 4a phone in windows
15:46:03 <troypatrick[m]> And I'm using factory cable that came with the pixel
15:46:32 <troypatrick[m]> Strange
15:46:33 <rosie> Ok.  the pic of your Pixel looks fine.
15:47:20 <rosie> Your PC isn't seeing the Pixel?
15:48:05 <troypatrick[m]> What if I use another regular usb b to c cable
15:48:05 <Pratyush[m]> just a movement.
15:48:51 <Pratyush[m]> wait do web installer require fastboot ?
15:49:01 <rosie> Nvm.  If Windows is seeing the Pixel, then the next step is to click the "unlock the bootloader" button in the Web installer.
15:49:16 <troypatrick[m]> I tried another pc
15:49:20 <troypatrick[m]> And it works on the other pc

16:09:02 <troypatrick[m]> Download the apk and install it? What if the app needs to update .. installing newer apk?
16:11:23 <nscnt[m]> troypatrick: That's an option, yes. However, F-Droid and Aurora Store are used by many users

16:28:32 <doubla> Ok, after the most recent GrapheneOS update, my phone is stuck in with the graphene boot logo. I've tried sideloading the most recent update to see if that would fix it, but no luck. Any ideas that wouldn't destroy my data?
16:29:15 <nscnt[m]> doubla: How long did you wait?
16:30:36 <doubla> Like a whole night. It also sometimes blacked out during the loading and restarted
16:32:09 <mrx777[m]> <doubla "Ok, after the most recent Graphe"> Rescue mode?
16:33:00 <mrx777[m]> <bikeman1234[m] "Hi! I have a pixel 5 and a Pixel"> Using Lyca
16:33:22 <doubla> Recovery mode. I've tried to find docs on using rescue mode for Grapheneos but I'm unsure. I would be appreciative for guidance in that regard as much of this is new to me
16:33:28 <nscnt[m]> doubla: The reboot after an update takes a little time. If an OTA fails to boot, the device will reboot back into the old partition
16:34:00 <doubla> Ok, that's what I read and was hoping for, but it's been a looong time
16:34:13 <nscnt[m]> doubla: 10 minutes should be max
16:34:18 <doubla> Could I've have messed that up by sideloading an update?
16:34:26 <doubla> Try like two hours.... smh
16:34:44 <nscnt[m]> doubla: Sideloading shouldn't have messed it up
16:35:38 <doubla> Hm, ok well that's at least reassuring
16:40:46 <nscnt[m]> doubla: I don't have any idea right now. I would just try to turn off the device and let it sit for a while. Later you can start it again. Maybe plugged into the charger (I don't know for how long it was on)
16:42:02 <rosie> Which setting should I use to make sure that the automatic update does its thing only when I'm on wifi? It's not clear to me from the user guide.

18:26:18 <Guest49145> have a small problem by installing adb
18:26:35 <Guest49145> hoping to get some help
18:31:50 <pkgbuild[m]> on which os
18:40:28 <P-G> Should I make a backup before attempting to flash Graphene on a new phone?
18:40:31 <rosie> @Guest49145  Any reason you don't use the Web installer?
18:40:55 <rosie> @P-G no need unless you were already using that phone before.
18:41:13 <P-G> Ok. If something goes unexpectedly wrong, how would I recover?
18:42:06 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: you can always revert to stock by using the android flash tool at https://flash.android.com .
18:42:06 <nscnt[m]> P-G: Flashing again. Either GrapheneOS or the stock OS
18:42:23 <P-G> Ok. Thanks. :)
18:42:35 <TheJollyRoger> The web installer should be fine. If it detects an anomaly, all that will happen is that it won't allow you to go forward, or will print an error and stop.
18:43:49 <P-G> Sounds good. I'm going to try the web installer since I'm not very familiar with firmware level stuff.
18:45:17 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Great. If you run into trouble, just holler, there's usually someone here that's been through it.
18:46:09 <rosie> The Web installer makes it VERY easy.
18:55:24 <P-G> "Unlock bootloader" can't find my phone, but the phone does appear in lsusb. Should I make a new udev rule for it and, if so, what subsystem should that be associated with?
18:56:46 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: is your phone in bootloader mode or is the OS running?
18:57:06 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: remember, once the phone has booted the OS, the bootloader is no longer running.
18:57:37 <P-G> Ahh, ok. That makes sense.
18:59:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. You'll need to read the directions very carefully: if the bootloader's not active, how's it supposed to get the "please unlock" request from the host?
18:59:58 <P-G> It did seem strange but I thought the O.S. might have support for that with OEM Unlocking enabled. :S
19:01:20 <P-G> If it says "Device state: locked", does that mean I'll need to call my ISP?
19:01:23 <TheJollyRoger> No, it doesn't, that must be done via the bootloader. The host must consent to have the bootloader unlocked first, but the decision to unlock the bootloader must be done at the bootloader.
19:01:34 <TheJollyRoger> No. Did you slide the OEM unlocking toggle to off?
19:01:46 <TheJollyRoger> Bootloader unlocked is different than Carrier Unlocked.
19:02:07 <P-G> Ok, that's a relief.
19:02:35 <P-G> Let me boot back into the O.S. and confirm. Maybe it got reset somehow.
19:02:41 <TheJollyRoger> You won't.
19:02:51 <TheJollyRoger> Just hit unlock and if it doesn't work, you didn't do it.
19:03:10 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to confirm it on the phone.
19:05:19 <P-G> OEM unlocking is enabled. Where do I hit "unlock"?
19:05:34 <P-G> There doesn't seem to be an option for that in the bootloader.
19:05:38 <TheJollyRoger> Look at https://grapheneos.org/install/web#unlocking-the-bootloader
19:05:39 <rosie> On the Web installer page on the host device.
19:05:54 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: you'll need to read everything before you begin.
19:05:59 <P-G> Ahh, derp.
19:06:17 <P-G> I did read it, TheJollyRoger. I'm just an idiot. >.<
19:06:19 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: note that Fireflops does not support WebUSB; only Chromium based browsers do.
19:06:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha don't worry, brainfarts happen to the best of us :P.
19:09:23 <P-G> It does find the device but after a few seconds shows "Error: Unable to set device configuration".
19:09:33 <P-G> No prompt or menu option in the bootloader.
19:10:04 <P-G> I'm using Chromium but my host O.S. isn't one of the recommended ones. That's why I thought it might be related to udev.
19:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> Sanity check, you're using a Google branded cable, correct?
19:11:00 <P-G> Yes. The one that came with the phone.
19:11:04 <P-G> Oh. Wait.
19:11:12 <P-G> I'm not...
19:11:36 <P-G> I was going to but they send the wrong adapter to Type-A. >_>
19:11:53 <P-G> Let me see if I can find one of those.
19:11:55 <TheJollyRoger> You can't use adapters, hubs, or front panels to install GrapheneOS. They don't have full tracing.
19:12:08 <TheJollyRoger> *they very often don't have full tracing.
19:12:13 <P-G> Hm.
19:12:18 <TheJollyRoger> So they'll do the bare minimum of transferring files or charging the device.
19:12:42 <TheJollyRoger> But as for whether or not they'll talk to low-level debugging interfaces, I dunno. Most vendors don't even wire their USB cables to do that because they assume their users aren't ever going to be doing that.
19:12:59 <TheJollyRoger> This unfortunately holds true for most USB slot vendors as well.
19:13:04 <P-G> So they sent me a Type-C cable (male/male) and an adapter from Type-C male to Type-A female.
19:13:29 <TheJollyRoger> Do you have a USB-A to USB-C cable made by Anker or Aukey?
19:13:42 <TheJollyRoger> That's USB 3.1 Gen 1 or later?
19:13:56 <P-G> I don't think so but I can check.
19:14:12 <P-G> Those do have the full tracing?
19:14:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
19:14:34 <TheJollyRoger> Keep in mind as well... not only does the USB cable need to have full tracing, but...
19:14:51 <TheJollyRoger> So does your computer's USB slots, and your computer's USB firmware needs to *support* full tracing.
19:14:56 <TheJollyRoger> *So do
19:15:33 <TheJollyRoger> From time to time, people get unlucky and find that some of their computer's USB slots don't adequately implement the entire USB spec. Sometimes, people get SUPER unlucky and find that *all* of their computer's USB slots are bad.
19:16:39 <TheJollyRoger> If this happens, that's not your fault, you've done nothing wrong, it's just a matter of the vendors being sloppy.
19:17:26 <P-G> Well, I found one mystery cable I can try but I'm going to try another port in the back first. Maybe that's it.
19:18:04 <TheJollyRoger> Fingers crossed.
19:20:03 <P-G> Yup. One of the back ports works. ^^
19:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent!
19:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> So note -- it's possible for unlocking to work, but then for flashing to hang. If this does happen, then it's likely that the cable is missing more than one wire.
19:21:20 <TheJollyRoger> (Funny fact actually, not even the Google branded cables are fully traced. Even though they work great at installing GrapheneOS, they're actually missing a wire for UART and can't be used to debug the phone via serial.)
19:21:32 <P-G> Lol.
19:21:42 <P-G> Does anyone make proper cables then?
19:21:52 <P-G> Just Anker and Aukey?
19:22:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I found this out actually by accident, after I soldered up a whole batch of cables and I was like "Wait what the hell why is..." and then I switched cables and it worked :P.
19:22:13 <TheJollyRoger> Drove me up the wall, I tell ya.
19:23:00 <P-G> Maybe I'll buy an Anker or Aukey just to keep around...
19:23:08 <TheJollyRoger> Well, Anker and Aukey are two examples of vendors that consistently do. Other companies do make compliant USB cables, but Anker and Aukey seem to be the most accessible to most people since they're in virtually every store.
19:23:55 <TheJollyRoger> Apple does, but we've seen a lot of people complain of insufficient durability, like the connectors popping off, or the ends fraying.
19:24:56 <P-G> I'm hoping the one I have works. It's one of those handy retractable ones.
19:25:38 <P-G> If it does then I'll send a link for reference.
19:27:12 <TheJollyRoger> Most Amazonbasics cables work but the verdict on them is "don't." They have consistently poor build quality and can brick devices because what some people have told me is that they tend to fray near the ends. This can be *incredibly* dangerous because if they fray there, they can short.
19:27:32 <TheJollyRoger> This can be *catastrophic* to not only the device, but also to *you*.
19:28:07 <P-G> You mean near the base of the connector, right? Not the connector tip?
19:28:11 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
19:28:35 <P-G> I've had that problem with cables in the past. These ones seem decent to me but we'll see.
19:29:26 <P-G> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D7T3WS4 (hopefully typed correctly)
19:29:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, fingers crossed. These days I generally just go with Anker or Aukey, since I feel like it's better I get ripped off and overpay for overpriced, oversold, name-branded cables, than short the phone's battery or kill a device by a short.
19:29:43 <P-G> I think the flash succeeded.
19:29:51 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Great!
19:30:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, the last step... you're going to have to relock the bootloader. That should be the next step.
19:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, ha, these look pretty nice.
19:30:32 <TheJollyRoger> Hope they work and are of good quality XP.
19:30:41 <P-G> So far so good. :)
19:30:53 <TheJollyRoger> But at three and a half bucks each... I'd be a bit cautious!
19:30:59 <TheJollyRoger> Whew!
19:31:08 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, so... once you hit lock bootloader, you'll need to confirm it back on the phone again.
19:31:19 <TheJollyRoger> When your phone boots the first time, you should see a yellow text warning that says,
19:31:30 <TheJollyRoger> "Your device is loading a different operating system. For more information, go to..." and then a URL.
19:31:42 <TheJollyRoger> You can skip this text by double-tapping the POWER key.
19:31:42 <P-G> Yup. Graphene just loaded.
19:31:46 <TheJollyRoger> But please confirm that you see it.
19:32:05 <TheJollyRoger> It should show every time you power off and cold start or reboot the phone.
19:32:16 <P-G> That's interesting.
19:32:42 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That screen signifies that you're loading a non-vendor operating system that doesn't belong to Google, but that the verified boot keys are provisioned, and enforcing.
19:33:12 <P-G> I guess that's a reasonable design choice.
19:33:15 <TheJollyRoger> That's a good thing and it means the hardware security features are switched on. But if that screen ever turns orange and gives you something that says "SOFTWARE INTEGRITY IS NOT GUARANTEED! DON'T USE THIS PHONE!" then you need to worry.
19:33:18 <smctwo> quick dumb question can we avoid seeing that yellow text by anyhow?
19:33:45 <P-G> Ok. Good to know!
19:33:57 <P-G> Those messages seem kind of ambiguous.
19:34:10 <TheJollyRoger> smctwo: No, you can't - we are hoping to someday get custom hardware which would be keyed to our own verified boot keys, in which case it would not show. But in interim, you can click through it by double-tapping POWER.
19:34:31 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Well, if you see the "Software integrity is not guaranteed!" warning screen, that definitely implies danger, it's much more ominous.
19:34:34 <smctwo> thanks, good to know
19:35:36 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: The next step is to disable OEM unlocking, you'll need to reactivate developer settings as you did before, and slide it back off.
19:35:38 <P-G> Is there a way to decrease the screen brightness during setup?
19:36:03 <TheJollyRoger> I actually dunno, I just sort of skipped through the setup...
19:36:07 <TheJollyRoger> XP
19:36:24 <P-G> I'll just hope it's short. ;D
19:36:45 <TheJollyRoger> It's pretty short. If you have a seedvault backup you can restore it there, and then you can connect to wifi, but that's it.
19:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> (Well, and check your time zone and date)
19:37:39 <P-G> It's asking about location services for apps that have asked my permission. If that's accurate, this seems permission system pretty different from Android.
19:38:08 <P-G> But with one word in a different place.
19:38:59 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, I didn't notice that (been so long since I went through the launcher!). But there is one thing to note:
19:39:39 <dub_a> hello, i'm using a belkin usbc to usba 3.1 on pixel4a and receiving this fastboot error 'fastboot: error: Failed to identify current slot
19:39:41 <TheJollyRoger> Since GrapheneOS does not bundle Google Play services, it can't use Play Services for location; apps that try to request location through Google Play won't get any answer back because Play isn't present.

19:41:05 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: you need to update your device before installing GrapheneOS.
19:41:13 <TheJollyRoger> The bootloader is too old.
19:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> Also make sure you're using Fastboot 31 from Google.
19:41:38 <TheJollyRoger> Or better yet, use the webinstaller at https://grapheneos.org/install/web
19:42:15 <TheJollyRoger> Any unofficial or third party version of fastboot is likely to leave you with an unbootable (or worse, a bricked) device
19:42:52 <M---------------> <dub_a "--------------------------------"> Well, thanks for pinging me. I got seriously confused :D
19:43:11 <TheJollyRoger> M---------------: Ahahahaha!
19:43:33 <P-G> I love how few apps this has installed.
19:44:02 <dub_a> oh apologies yeah I'll use the pastebin next time
19:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: no problem!
19:44:36 <P-G> And the confidence that Google won't be installing new apps for me with whatever permissions they feel like I should use.
19:45:06 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: an easy solution to this problem is switch your phone on, connect it to WiFi, and let it update. If you don't want to do that, you can download the OTA update package from google, and sideload it.
19:45:24 <TheJollyRoger> But unfortunately, I'm out of time at this moment, I have to step away from my desk and I can't walk you through that process, so the easy way...
19:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> the easiest way would be to simply let your phone update with the regular factory OS because the bootloader's too old, and then use the webinstaller to install GrapheneOS.
19:45:52 <dub_a> so I let it update on my work's wifi earlier this week and it's currently on android 11? Why is the bootloader so old
19:45:55 <TheJollyRoger> If you're still having trouble, I can get around to you later when I get back.
19:46:20 <P-G> Thanks for the help. :)
19:47:16 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Anytime, you're welcome! If you find GrapheneOS useful, please send the devs something at https://grapheneos.org/donate <- donations keep this ship sailing on our voyage to more secure and private Android. Welcome aboard the ship.
19:47:35 <dub_a> ah, fair enough. I'm going through the steps you mentioned to see if I can't figure something out
19:47:56 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: It's only a small increment, between 5-0.3-6835615 and 5-0.3-7062598.
19:48:42 <TheJollyRoger> dub_a: sure. I have to step away from my desk, but if you still have trouble, reach out here and someone should be able to let you know, or I will when I return.
20:01:00 <bikeman1234[m]> What actually happens when i do factory reset on a pixel 5 with GrapheneOS ? Is the data deleted and owerwritten? Or its still there but encrypted? Would it be possible for anyone to restore any data forensically? If its encrypted, would the key have anything to do with the password or its just a random key?
20:06:41 <P-G> I don't know the answer to most of your questions but this might answer the fourth/fifth: https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
20:12:07 <mynacol[m]> <bikeman1234[m] "What actually happens when i do "> A factory reset will wipe the cryptographic keys in the Titan M chip. Without them, nobody can access the data, even if you have the correct password/pin. Overwriting the data is therefore not needed and reduces stress on the flash storage.
20:13:44 <troypatrick[m]> How do you get apps on the home screen
20:13:57 <troypatrick[m]> After installing an app it didn't appear on the home screen
20:14:07 <troypatrick[m]> I feel dumb now lol
20:14:34 <troypatrick[m]> Nevermind I just figured it out
20:14:47 <troypatrick[m]> Jumped from a pixel 2 to 4a
20:14:53 <troypatrick[m]> And it's a bit different
20:18:22 <Cliff[m]> What is the best way to block ads in vanadium?
20:20:58 <dub_a> oh my days I'm so embarrassed I should've just tried web installer. RTFM. It worked like a charm
20:21:22 <dub_a> I am curious to know why the terminal didn't work. I virtually changed nothing other than install chromium for webusb and going through the same process
20:21:35 <Ted5> What is the best GPS app to use? waze doesnt work
20:22:09 <zezaku666[m]> Here
20:22:35 <southron[m]> <Ted5 "What is the best GPS app to use?"> Try Magic Earth
20:23:11 <zezaku666[m]> <Ted5 "What is the best GPS app to use?"> Here app is realy good
20:28:14 <helloworldkk87[m> <Cliff[m] "What is the best way to block ad"> For now Vanadium is focused on pure security and you should use something like Bromite for ad blocking and anti-fingerprinting
20:29:16 <grapheneos_user_> <Cliff[m] "What is the best way to block ad"> You can't. Vanadium has no built-in adblocking and doesn't support extensions.
20:31:36 <Cliff[m]> I remember reading here i think it was TheJollyRoger saying you can block it using dns block or some thing like that?
20:33:06 <helloworldkk87[m> https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking
20:33:12 <jj1013[m]> Bridge?

20:35:26 <grapheneos_user_> <Cliff[m] "I remember reading here i think "> bad idea to give a program system-wide access
20:35:41 <grapheneos_user_> also what helloworldkk87 is saying is correct

20:36:41 <P-G> I don't think so.
20:36:49 <helloworldkk87[m> Hmm
20:36:51 <P-G> I just installed. Haven't done anything with profiles.
20:37:02 <kepoff[m]> <jj1013[m] "Who's in charge of the Telegram "> Not sure, but I think anupritaisno1 was working on it

20:37:29 <helloworldkk87[m> Maybe has to do with your carrier but Im not an expert so dont really know.. Sorry :(
20:37:52 <P-G> There's also a line entry that just says "Settings version" that doesn't seem to do anything when I click it.
20:37:56 <P-G> A bit odd.

20:59:32 <graphene_dad> Hi, I installed Graphene on a Pixel 5 using the web installer ( on Chromium/Debian), and while I was flashing, I received the following "Error: Unable to claim interface" at the fastbootd screen. After the error I flashed again, and it worked fine. Was wondering if anyone knew why this might happen?
21:00:26 <jj1013[m]> <graphene_dad "Hi, I installed Graphene on a Pi"> Between the reasons:
21:18:03 <P-G> Is F-Droid the recommended way to find and install apps?
21:20:54 <sphinx[m]> There is no 'recommended way'. It's just what people use (and Aurora Store).
21:20:59 * m4g3nt4[m]  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vKypYADUafcalsrYSZxzcLkk/message.txt >
21:21:54 <P-G> Ok. I just ask because there are clearly some that are not recommended. ;)
21:22:12 <jj1013[m]> <m4g3nt4[m] "> <@jj1013.:privacytools.io> Bet"> He succeded in flashing anyways.
21:24:02 <m4g3nt4[m]> Ok
21:28:05 <graphene_dad> Thanks, I figured it was something like a hiccup, but thought I'd drop in and ask. Hitting the flash button again from the fastbootd/Error pushed restarted the process and pushed it through
21:31:22 <P-G> Does Android/Graphene employ reasonable access controls on apps installed by APK or is that somewhat dependant on the package manager? Just curious.
21:32:33 <P-G> Aside from user visible permissions, I mean. Things like filesystem permissions.
21:45:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> Silent Solutions Ltd. (@s​ilentsolutions) has joined the Telegram Group!
21:57:35 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: if you do a factory reset on a Pixel 5, the security chip will shred ALL of its access tokens. The data becomes unrecoverable permanently, no ifs, ands, or buts, or exceptions.
21:58:46 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: Adblocking actually causes you to stand out by allowing websites to enumerate the domains you've blocked and make you uniquely identifiable across the internet, this is why Vanadium doesn't support adblocking.
22:00:39 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Not sure what you mean by "reasonable access controls" - all apps, including privileged system apps, are fully sandboxed, at all times, all the time. Short of finding an exploit, they can only get access to data given to them by the operating system. Even low-level system processes with root-equivalent access such as vold, init, and kernel are constrained by mandatory access controls to
22:00:42 <TheJollyRoger> only do what they need to do and *nothing* else.
22:01:36 <Yourmomuwu[m]> <P-G "Does Android/Graphene employ rea"> install by APK? what does that mean? you mean installing. apk file or are you refering to some APK site?
22:01:46 <Yourmomuwu[m]> * install by APK? what does that mean? you mean installing. apk file or are you refering to some APK site?
22:01:52 <P-G> Hm. Ok. This is still pretty vague to me but I trust you're right.
22:02:00 <Yourmomuwu[m]> * install by APK? what does that mean? you mean installing .apk file or are you refering to some APK site?
22:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> P-G it doesn't matter where you install the apps from, be it sideloading via APK, installed via a third-party, or a hypothetical first party app store, or as preinstalled system apps, or system components, the apps are always sandboxed.
22:03:05 <TheJollyRoger> Android isn't built like a desktop operating system; it's built as a series of separate components that are all internally sandboxed to only do what they need to do.
22:03:48 <P-G> Ok. That's good enough for me then. Probably something I should learn more about some day.
22:03:53 <Yourmomuwu[m]> .apk is android file type, just like. exe on windows
22:04:04 * troypatrick[m] uploaded an image: (52KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/nEPOSOFCYrTLSuEJgiZmxIWj/20210410_180239_5365615024404685588.jpg >
22:04:14 <troypatrick[m]> Is this normal when turning on the pixel
22:04:17 <Yourmomuwu[m]> all apps on android are .apk files
22:04:18 <TheJollyRoger> Even vold, which can talk to the SSD directly at a low level still is constrained by the mandatory access controls which are enforced by the kernel.
22:04:18 <P-G> Well, I don't trust all Windows applications to not cause problems or steal my data.
22:04:26 <troypatrick[m]> It shows this screen then I see the Google logo
22:04:30 <troypatrick[m]> Then the grapheneos logo
22:04:44 <TheJollyRoger> troypatrick[m]: Yes, that's normal and expected.
22:04:47 <rosie> troypatrick[m] Yes, that's normal.
22:04:53 <TheJollyRoger> troypatrick[m]: if you didn't see it, it'd mean you were loading Google's operating system.
22:04:55 <troypatrick[m]> Okay cool ty
22:05:26 <Yourmomuwu[m]> bruh imagine debloating Android completely but still having to see google logo everytime you turn on phone
22:05:27 <TheJollyRoger> troypatrick[m]: you only need to worry if that screen text turns orange and it gives you a scary looking warning about "SOFTWARE INTEGRITY NOT GUARANTEED! Don't use this phone!"
22:05:57 <troypatrick[m]> Okay I'll remember that thanks
22:05:58 <TheJollyRoger> troypatrick[m]: Yourmomuwu[m] the OEM logo is a part of the late stage bootloader, which is signed and verified. It's only there to display the OEM logo. It's purely cosmetic, but we can't change it.
22:06:18 <rosie> yet.  right?
22:06:24 <TheJollyRoger> troypatrick[m]: if you turned OEM unlocking back off after installing GrapheneOS and verified using auditor and attestationserver, then you should be fine.
22:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> rosie: At a future date, GrapheneOS would like to get custom hardware made by an OEM, which would allow us to have our own logo and fuse the bootloader with our own keys.
22:07:23 <P-G> TheJollyRoger, do you know why I'm having trouble finding this one setting? https://www.grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
22:07:27 <Cliff[m]> <helloworldkk87[m "Something like ProtonVPN has Net"> I am using mullvad right now but also still have a nordvpn account do you happen to know if it is possible with them?
22:07:28 <TheJollyRoger> If we did that, then we'd have our own keys as first-party verified boot keys which would eliminate the yellow screen warning, and our own OEM mark the handset as their own.
22:07:41 <rosie> Cool!
22:07:47 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Where are you looking for it?
22:08:11 <P-G> Settings->Network & Internet->Mobile network
22:08:36 <P-G> I can't find "Preferred network type", but it does find two matches when I search for "network type".
22:09:35 <rosie> Are you looking for system update?
22:09:46 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, should be under Mobile Network, not sure why you aren't seeing it.
22:10:02 <TheJollyRoger> Wonder if your carrier doesn't support LTE.
22:10:39 <rosie> If you don't have your SIM card in, Mobile Network will be greyed out.
22:11:49 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "bikeman1234: if you do a factory"> Is this the same for the titan m chip in the pixel 4a?
22:11:52 <P-G> I have a SIM card and I've already used it successfully.
22:12:13 <P-G> I can open Mobile Network but that last setting just isn't there. Or maybe I'm blind.
22:12:34 <rosie> Ok.  I don't have my SIM card in my phone yet, so I can't look.
22:13:22 <P-G> My service provider does offer 3g, 4g, and 5g in some areas. I don't know what's available where I am right now but my service plan should support all of those.
22:13:44 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: all Pixels including the 3, and all a-series pixels, such as the 3a, include the Titan security chip.
22:13:59 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Hmm, very strange.
22:14:12 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Cliff: Adblocking actually cause"> I understand do ads themselves pose security risks?
22:15:48 <P-G> Two other things that seem strange to me on that page: (1) "Settings version" seems out of place and does nothing and (2) "Wi-Fi Calling"->"Roaming preference" is set to Wi-Fi but "Wi-Fi Calling" description says "Call over mobile network".
22:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: This is why Vanadium on GrapheneOS implements site isolation and builds on the chromium sandbox to make it harder for processes to escape from their respective sandboxes.
22:18:43 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Settings Version is like that for me as well. Preferred network type should be right above it...?
22:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: I'm not saying all advertising domains are serving malware, but this is why Vanadium makes those security improvements, since if they were, they need to be contained.
22:22:51 <Cliff[m]> TheJollyRoger  can i use vanadium on my pc as well?
22:23:59 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: Many of Vanadium's security features are designed to leverage Graphene's improvements in memory safety and sandboxing. You could try porting the patchset over and building it yourself, but I don't think you'd get any benefit, if you even got it to compile.
22:26:29 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Cliff: Many of Vanadium's securi"> Last question bit off topic wich browser would you recommend for pc and stock android
22:27:16 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: I tell you what, I'll answer you in the offtopic channel :)
22:27:54 <P-G> TheJollyRoger: above "Settings version" for me is "Data warning & limit". :S
22:28:35 <TheJollyRoger> P-G, hmm, not sure. I know that for some users it doesn't appear, I'll have to get back to you on it.
22:30:47 <P-G> Ok, please do. I guess the questions would be whether this only shows up for ISP that support LTE and, if so, what could cause it to not be there if my plan should include LTE?
22:30:57 <opulus[m]> Are you talking about the LTE only mode?
22:31:01 <P-G> Yes.
22:31:30 <opulus[m]> Yeah some us carriers don't have that option for some reason
22:34:54 <opulus[m]> On another note, does anyone know how to manually clear the clipboard using the default GrapheneOS keyboard?
22:40:09 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "rosie: At a future date, Graphen"> Bad idea. Last time you partnered with a company ended up really badly.
22:42:04 <louipc> one negative outcome should not be the definition of all future outcomes
22:42:13 <P-G> For what it's worth, I almost bought a Pine Phone. I don't know if they would be a good choice for higher end hardware but open-source hardware would be nice.
22:42:54 <louipc> and lessons are learned through failure which can improve likelyhood of future success
22:45:34 <bikeman1234[m]> if someone should try to get access to a graphene phone with bruteforce, would it be possible to bruteforce a secondary profile without first gaining access to the owner profile? Or is it safe to use a shorter password for secundary profiles
22:57:52 <jamiethebutler20> so i'm getting a google pixel 4a tomorrow, will brave work for web install?(garuda linux, arch based distro, up to date system)
22:59:01 <opulus[m]> Does anyone know how to manually clear the clipboard using the default GrapheneOS keyboard?
23:01:19 <chile09[m]> does the webUSB method work using macOS?
23:02:00 <strcat[m]> chile09: covered on the site
23:02:05 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install/web
23:02:18 <strcat[m]> > Officially supported operating systems for the web install method:
23:07:53 <chile09[m]> the unlock the bootloader button is greyed out
23:08:13 <chile09[m]> does that mean the device is not being recognized by the OS?
23:08:44 <ttamttam[m]> Are you using chromium?
23:10:18 <strcat[m]> chile09: did you read what it says about supported browsers?
23:10:25 <strcat[m]> you need to read everything that's there
23:10:27 <strcat[m]> don't skip over it
23:10:35 <strcat[m]> if you're unwilling to do that, please don't try to do it
23:15:29 <TheJollyRoger> bikeman1234[m]: Even if someone did compromise the owner profile, it still wouldn't be possible to brute force the secondary profiles; a four-digit pin number on the Pixel 3 and later would take roughly 650 years to completely exhaust the key space of 0000 to 9999 because of the Titan M. Although the owner profile is capable of creating and deleting other profiles and granting and denying
23:15:30 <TheJollyRoger> access to the device's phone and text messages to them, there's nothing that gives it domain over other profiles, or their encryption keys.
23:16:42 <strcat[m]> bikeman1234: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption first
23:17:16 <Cliff[m]> <TheJollyRoger "bikeman1234: Even if someone did"> So no need for a passphrase password?
23:17:23 <strcat[m]> P-G: that is not 'open source hardware', you've unfortunately fallen for misinformation
23:17:26 <Cliff[m]> Even main profile?
23:17:58 <strcat[m]> Cliff: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
23:18:02 <strcat[m]> that is not what was said
23:18:21 <strcat[m]> reading that is mandatory before asking questions about the topuic
23:18:25 <strcat[m]>  * reading that is mandatory before asking questions about the topic
23:18:41 <strcat[m]> if you have questions about it after reading it, ask those
23:18:46 <TheJollyRoger> Cliff[m]: GrapheneOS allows you to use up to 64 character passphrases at your discretion. This is if you'd like to, if you believe that you want to rely on more than the strength of the Titan. Google took a very pragmatic approach because they realized that most users expect security out of a 4-digit pincode, and took steps to help with that.
23:26:26 <P-G> You're right, strcat. That might have just been my misconception.
23:27:13 <P-G> Still, I do like the idea of both open hardware and the Pine Phone.
23:27:19 <strcat[m]> P-G: I wouldn't call it a misconception
23:27:26 <strcat[m]> it is a deliberate falsehood spread by people
23:27:37 <strcat[m]> P-G: it's not open hardware
23:27:52 <P-G> Yes, I know. I'm not sure why I thought it was.
23:28:03 <P-G> Maybe an assumption.
23:28:11 <jj1013[m]> <strcat[m] "P-G: that is not 'open source ha"> Oh, pity. I thought the PinePhone really was.
23:28:15 <strcat[m]> no
23:28:15 <strcat[m]> it isn't
23:28:19 <jj1013[m]> It advertises itself as such, I thing.
23:28:21 <strcat[m]> I don't know why you would think that
23:28:30 <jj1013[m]>  * It advertises itself as such, I think
23:28:30 <strcat[m]> jj1013.: I don't think they do
23:28:38 <TheJollyRoger> Well, generally what a lot of these companies do is they imply it, but they stop just short of out and saying it.
23:28:46 <P-G> I don't think they do either, but maybe.
23:28:48 <strcat[m]> this is off-topic and you folks are contributing to spreading misinformation of the same kind that misled you
23:29:03 <P-G> Off-topic is true.
23:29:15 <strcat[m]> there is no ARM SoC that is in any sense open hardware
23:29:19 <strcat[m]> that's fairly obvious, no?
23:29:41 <strcat[m]> most RISC-V SoCs are entirely closed source too, only the API they use to talk to software is open in most cases
23:29:51 <strcat[m]> but with ARM it is inherently going to be closed source
23:29:56 <strcat[m]> the other components are closed source too
23:30:00 <strcat[m]> so, closed source hardware / firmware
23:30:20 <strcat[m]> the only thing that'd distinct about it is they market it and ship it with OSes based on the desktop Linux software stack, that's it
23:30:21 <P-G> I don't know much about electronics to be honest. For all I know maybe Arm does develop some open hardware.
23:30:27 <strcat[m]> does not make the hardware/firmware any more open
23:30:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> There is ONE open hardware RISC-V device I'm aware of, and it's not in production yet
23:30:44 <strcat[m]> now, please drop it, further people advertising products especially via false claims will be banned
23:31:02 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: there's not any, afaik
23:31:17 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: there is an SoC with open core designs but the SoC as a whole is largely proprietary
23:31:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> I could double check, but I think they publish schematics of the chips and everything
23:32:10 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: doesn't imply that the components are all open source
23:32:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> Possible I misread it and they're only providing a schematic of the board.
23:32:43 <strcat[m]> schematics of board is a common thing
23:32:47 <strcat[m]> there are ARM devices doing that
23:32:49 <strcat[m]> doesn't make it open
23:32:56 <strcat[m]> that's like 0.01% of the overall picture
23:33:27 <cyborgninjaneer[> I know.
23:33:46 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm looking at it again. Do you want me to pm you a link?
23:33:57 <strcat[m]> you can PM me a link
23:34:00 <strcat[m]> probably already aware of it
23:34:30 <strcat[m]> people wrongly think RISC-V means that the chip is open source
23:34:32 <cyborgninjaneer[> Ok
23:34:32 <strcat[m]> and most are not
23:34:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Yeah no. Just open architecture
23:34:58 <strcat[m]> no
23:35:00 <strcat[m]> not an open architecture
23:35:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> Maybe that's not the right term
23:35:11 <strcat[m]> RISC-V is not an open CPU architecture
23:35:26 <strcat[m]> RISC-V is an open source ISA, i.e. the API used by software to use a CPU
23:35:30 <strcat[m]> it is an API
23:36:23 <strcat[m]> it's a standard + documentation for the API used by software to run on a CPU
23:36:24 <strcat[m]> that's it
23:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I like to say that RISC-V is a sheet of paper. The chips made with it, are only as open as their vendors will allow.
23:36:44 <strcat[m]> not an open architecture, not open hardware
23:37:02 <TheJollyRoger> NVIDIA is actually a big user of RISC-V, they used it to replace their older generation Falcon processor in their GPUs.
23:37:03 <strcat[m]> it does not prescribe/standardize stuff about the internal architecture
23:37:18 <TheJollyRoger> As you might expect, nothing in it is open.
23:37:34 <strcat[m]> it is possible to make an open source CPU core design providing the RISC-V ISA, or even a whole SoC
23:37:39 <strcat[m]> most are not in any way open source
23:37:50 <TheJollyRoger> The whole reason they're using it, is simply because this way they don't have to pay royalties to continue using the old Falcon chip.
23:38:17 <strcat[m]> RISC-V is to CPUs as JSON is to web services
23:38:27 <strcat[m]> a web service using JSON for their API doesn't mean the web service is open source...
23:38:38 <TheJollyRoger> Heh heh, yeah...
23:39:04 <strcat[m]> it is a standardized instruction set with optional extensions
23:39:07 <strcat[m]> that's what is open
23:39:26 <strcat[m]> vendors can further extend it as much as they want and nothing about their implementation has to be open
23:39:28 <strcat[m]> and it usually won't be
23:39:55 <strcat[m]> and btw, Power has an open source architecture available (not just the ISA) and already existed
23:40:17 <bingusite[m]> I haven't found this issue anywhere, when I connect my device (pixel 4a 5g) to the PC it does not allow me to set the PC as being in control of the USB, the phone is in control of it but I enabled file transfer. I don't imagine it'd be an issue would it?
23:40:42 <strcat[m]> the hype for RISC-V is largely based on people not realizing there were already open ISAs (with open architectures too) and a misunderstanding that using it makes the hardware at all open when it doesn't
23:41:11 <chile09[m]> ok using chrome canary, was able to unlock bootloader but factory image download gives error "An operation that changes interfacestate is in progress"
23:41:30 <strcat[m]> chile09: sounds like you already started it elsewhere
23:41:36 <strcat[m]> also not sure why you're using an experimental browser
23:41:41 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: sounds like something else is using USB.
23:41:49 <strcat[m]> suggest rebooting your computer
23:41:59 <strcat[m]> do not attempt to do it from multiple browsers at the same time
23:42:06 <strcat[m]> use a stable release of a browser, not an experimental one
23:42:24 <strcat[m]> perhaps you ran software like `adb` following some unofficial guide that's interfering with it now
23:42:31 <strcat[m]> suggest rebooting and carefully following what's on that page
23:42:43 <strcat[m]> if you deviate from it you're taking a lot of unnecessary risk
23:42:59 <chile09[m]> It was giving the same behaviour on stock chrome
23:43:01 <P-G> I thought we were supposed to stop talking about this?
23:43:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> strcat: thanks for clearing that up. Gtg
23:43:50 <TheJollyRoger> bingusite[m]: You can enable file transfer to transfer stuff to and from your phone's shared partition via the USB, that's all that does, or you can tether if you want.
23:45:59 <bingusite[m]> <TheJollyRoger "bingusite: You can enable file t"> ok, thanks
23:46:05 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
23:46:38 <strcat[m]> P-G: I'm talking about something on-topic, I'm not advertising / promoting a product not relevant to GrapheneOS
23:47:05 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, he be our cap'n.
