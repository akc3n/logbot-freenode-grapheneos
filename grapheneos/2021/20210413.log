00:02:27 <strcat[m]> gos-network-signal-linphone: there's no point of hiding those things you did: verified boot hash is the hash of the OS (same for everyone for the same OS version)
00:02:48 <strcat[m]> gos-network-signal-linphone: identity is just the hash of the public key for the key it generated, i.e. a random number that stays the same for the pairing
00:03:04 <strcat[m]> if you clear pairing and redo it, will be a different hash
00:03:17 <strcat[m]> device manager and accessibility services are listed at the bottom
00:04:39 <gos-network-sign> OK, I've just "reset app preferences", first in the owner profile, then in my user profile. When I go to Signal and remove the Network and sensor permissions that have just come, I am able to send a message ("note to self") to my PC.
00:05:17 <strcat[m]> gos-network-signal-linphone: did you run Auditor in both
00:05:29 <strcat[m]> check that neither has device manager / accessibility service
00:06:06 <strcat[m]> it sounds to me like Permission Controller is broken for you probably for the reason I said
00:06:11 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "gos-network-signal-linphone: did"> not in owner. Just in my main user profile.
00:06:23 <strcat[m]> check both
00:07:25 <strcat[m]> Settings -> Apps & notifications -> Special access -> Usage access (should generally say 'no apps') -> toggle on "Show system" and make sure *all* of the OS components that are supposed to have it do have it
00:07:29 <Forbo[m]> <r357[m] "Reviving this, running into the "> I'm also experiencing this issue, not sure what I should do at this point. I have a list of 36 T-Mobile APNs that were pulled automatically, and I can't add, delete, or modify any of them.
00:08:19 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "check both"> I don't have another android device to do the check now. If you tell me the online procedure do not send any information relative only to my device, I'm happy to try the online procedure.
00:08:42 <strcat[m]> it doesn't send any identifying or personal info
00:08:57 <strcat[m]> just the state and settings it checks, you can see what it does in the output you got earlier
00:09:38 <strcat[m]> gos-network-signal-linphone: it's possible resetting app preferences already fixed the issue but now Signal install is messed up and has to be reinstalled, you could use Signal's encrypted backup / restore feature
00:10:03 <strcat[m]> I'm guessing the issue was permission controller having the usage stats access it needs removed
00:13:00 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "Settings -> Apps & notifications"> I'm in my user profile (not owner). If "all of the OS components" means: Bluetooth, NFC service,package installer, permission controller, phone services, shell, storage manager and system UI, then they all have "allowed"
00:14:10 <strcat[m]> probably should have had you check that before resetting app prefs
00:14:14 <strcat[m]> too late to see if it was the issue now
00:14:22 <strcat[m]> gos-network-signal-linphone: check owner too
00:14:42 <strcat[m]> and then make a Signal backup with Signal's backup feature -> uninstall and reinstall it
00:14:59 <strcat[m]> but I cannot tell you what else might be broken
00:15:04 <strcat[m]> based on whatever was wrong
00:15:17 <strcat[m]> so there was a reason I recommended a factory reset
00:15:32 <strcat[m]> I won't be able to invest the time in helping you debug and fix whatever went wrong

00:18:19 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "I won't be able to invest the ti"> Thanks for your time! Much appreciated, by the way!!
00:20:10 <strcat[m]> yes, reinstall that too
00:20:23 <strcat[m]> probably other stuff screwed up beyond that
00:20:41 <strcat[m]> don't really know what you did
00:20:57 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "probably other stuff screwed up "> Well, then, I guess the factory reset is the cleanest way. :-/
00:21:23 <strcat[m]> we should at some point stop people breaking the OS with the Settings app by restricting more cases but it's hard to do that without simply disallowing it outright for system components
00:23:42 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "we should at some point stop peo"> Well, I installed it first to just test. But then I reinstalled and did not want to mess with it anymore. That's why I'm surprised I did something wrong. Only thing I remember doing is: (1) install apps, (2) configure them via their menus and (3) remove the "sensor" from all apps and "network" from some apps that don't need it.
00:24:17 <strcat[m]> so were you removing permissions from system apps?
00:27:04 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "so were you removing permissions"> Not from system apps! Only from some of the apps that I installed that don't need network. My 2FA authentication app does not need network. I removed "network" from the gallery app (which I did not install by myself, just to be complete!)
00:32:06 <gos-network-sign> Actually, I remove the network permission from Signal (that should obviously need it) because I wanted to show something on my phone to a friend while not have signal notifications of messages coming. I was surprised to continue receive signal notifications of messages coming when I had disabled the network. That's how it all started. One day, Linphone was ringing and (I thought) I had deactivated it by denying
00:32:06 <gos-network-sign> the network permission. I did not try all the apps, though. The podcast app stops playing as soon as I remove the network permission.
00:32:42 <gos-network-sign> Sorry for my poor English when trying to type fast!! :-)
00:33:53 <gos-network-sign> Looks like I'm the only one to have the problem. If some more users come, you'll have a detailed account of my experience in the logs.
00:34:04 <gos-network-sign> Thank you again very much for your time.
00:34:14 <gos-network-sign> I guess I'll have to re-install.
00:40:25 <strcat[m]> gos-network-signal-linphone: never heard of this kind of thing happening before
00:40:36 <strcat[m]> and yes I'd suggest reinstalling
00:40:55 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "gos-network-signal-linphone: nev"> Not happy to be the 1st one! ;-)
00:41:21 <gos-network-sign> <strcat[m] "and yes I'd suggest reinstalling"> I'll do that when I have time. Thanks again!!!
00:41:24 <strcat[m]> I do know how to cause issues like that: do something like remove usage stats from Permission Controller
00:41:34 <strcat[m]> but it is not clear how the issues were caused
00:41:37 <strcat[m]> I can only guess
00:42:15 <strcat[m]> anyway basically when permissions already exist to do something, system components tend to reuse those, even highly privileged and/or core system components
00:42:36 <strcat[m]> when they don't already exist as normal permissions for regular apps, they use special internal privileged permissions only available for privileged system components
00:42:44 <strcat[m]> those aren't user-facing, it's the internal OS implementation
00:43:00 <strcat[m]> so, it's actually a bit strange that you can go and disable stuff needed by Permission Controller, etc.
00:43:19 <strcat[m]> it's just a side effect of it being implemented via the standard app infrastructure and permission model to the extent possible
00:43:57 <strcat[m]> it probably shouldn't be possible to toggle things for those, only for user-facing apps bundled with the OS, which is not the same thing as a core system component
00:44:32 <strcat[m]> Settings app has a really bad approximation of what should allow toggles based on the signing key, where it disallows it for stuff signed with platform key, but not other system components
00:51:41 <gos-network-sign> You came a bit too technical for my AOSP/GOS knowledge, here! :-)
00:51:41 <gos-network-sign> I have to go now, it's quite late here.
00:51:41 <gos-network-sign> Thanks for all your support!!

04:05:32 <danascape[m]> are non Google devices allowed for official ?
04:06:01 <danascape[m]> to be clear, if caf hal implementation is possible on source ?
04:17:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy danascape[m], I'll let you in on a little secret:
04:18:25 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS can certainly be built for devices that it doesn't officially run on, but there's more to it: assuming that your hypothetical desired device actually meets the requirements to run GrapheneOS, to actually do it in such a way that would be able to meet or exceed the security properties of the vendor operating system would likely be an ongoing cost that could quickly exceed more than a
04:18:26 <TheJollyRoger> hundred grand each year.
04:19:02 <ryanrambharose[7> Im reading alot of no for pixel devices and hdmi out via usb c. Does GOS change this?
04:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why is simple: a large amount of highly specialized work has to go into porting the source code to that specific work and--
04:19:15 <TheJollyRoger> ryanrambharose[7: no, it does not.
04:19:21 <TheJollyRoger> whoops,
04:19:48 <TheJollyRoger> **The reason why is simple: a large amount of highly specialized work has to go into making the release specific to that specific device. Device-specific hardening, workarounds, and exploit mitigations need to be done.
04:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> All of which is specific to that particular phone.
04:19:59 <ryanrambharose[7> How about usb c to usb c display
04:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> Generally, most people that have an understanding of the amount of work that it would take -- and can do that work -- tend to be paid six-figure salaries to do it at android OEMs.
04:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> So, there's nothing stopping someone in the community from stepping up and doing the work and the community compiling and supporting community builds for devices that GrapheneOS does not official support, not at all, but that should give you an idea of the amount of work that it does take, considering that generally in order to support a device sustainably, the rule is "one person, one device."
04:22:41 <TheJollyRoger> *one person dedicated to working on the device full time, per device.
04:24:07 <TheJollyRoger> *that GrapheneOS does not officially support, not at all,
04:24:43 <TheJollyRoger> For all other inquiries, please see https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support

04:27:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm, looks like the Matrix to IRC bridge is broken again, at least for some users.
04:29:11 <christhepanda[m]> <TheJollyRoger "*one person dedicated to working"> And, as stated in the project, a goal is to eventually create a device so that we no longer need to rely on a third party to manufacture devices.
04:29:34 <TheJollyRoger> Hopefully in the future!
04:30:18 <christhepanda[m]> Yup. We just need more people to use this stuff, and hopefully, donate to the project, or contribute.
04:31:33 <christhepanda[m]> I'm learning to be a dev myself, so that I can contribute, and have a backup job in case my current one injure me.
04:31:50 <christhepanda[m]> * I'm learning to be a dev myself, so that I can contribute, and have a backup job in case my current one injures me.
04:48:18 <TheJollyRoger> christhepanda[m]: Glad to have you onboard!
04:49:43 <christhepanda[m]> k.
04:55:00 <danascape[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The reason why is simple: a larg"> for that, I have worked on aosp for quite long and my device is bootable with a minimal number of patches, the next thing is tracking of new repositories.
04:59:38 <strcat[m]> device support needs to be self-contained
04:59:40 <strcat[m]> and it needs to meet the standards
04:59:52 <strcat[m]> a device we support must have proper full security updates and the expected security features
04:59:57 <strcat[m]> and fully working functionality
05:00:04 <strcat[m]> device support cannot involve invasive changes
05:00:09 <strcat[m]> just a device repo, kernel repo, etc.
05:00:14 <strcat[m]> drop in support, nothing invasive
05:00:23 <strcat[m]> needs to be based around Treble
05:00:34 <strcat[m]> no point asking us to do anything else and no amount of funding will result in more supported devices
05:00:37 <strcat[m]> developers are needed
05:01:09 <strcat[m]> there has to be some reason for me building + testing official releases on another device too
05:01:10 <strcat[m]> aside from all that
05:01:49 <strcat[m]> so, meets all standards + at least one full-time developer is going to be working on it and all the work branching out from it + working on other things to make up for needing to support another device
05:02:03 <danascape[m]> no need to worry about that
05:02:17 <danascape[m]> I'll meet upto the standards you expect and I'm dedicated
05:02:27 <danascape[m]> the device is treble and is stable on pure aosp
05:02:38 <danascape[m]> I'll be honoured to join once you verify my work
05:03:00 <danascape[m]> currently the build is going on, I'll update the info
05:03:49 <danascape[m]> I'll also want my device to be daily drivable and secure on any OS I run on it
05:08:52 <Dylanger[m]> <danascape[m] "the device is treble and is stab"> What specific device is it?
05:08:54 <strcat[m]> we don't have the resources to just add support for more devices
05:09:04 <strcat[m]> and they need to meet all requirements to have official support from us
05:09:17 <strcat[m]> supporting a device implies buying one and building + testing each release for it
05:09:21 <strcat[m]> and addressing problems with it, etc.
05:12:40 <Dylanger[m]> Google is the only Android OEM that releases updates monthly that I know of
05:12:45 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> I wish it was easy to port GOS to other device. I would have if I knew how to.
05:13:12 <danascape[m]> <Dylanger[m] "What specific device is it?"> redmi note 8
05:13:17 <danascape[m]> monthly updates
05:13:26 <danascape[m]> its still supported by oem
05:14:03 <danascape[m]> <strcat[m] "supporting a device implies buyi"> oh, I understand, so there is no other way where you do not have to buy the device ?
05:14:33 <Dylanger[m]> SDM665, at least it's Qualcomm, you can use the Generic ARM64 build target to build a GSI - I've played with this on a Mi 11 and it works well
05:14:40 <Dylanger[m]> It's good for testing/playing
05:15:29 <Dylanger[m]> > Providing proper support for a device or generic device family requires providing an up-to-date kernel and device support code including driver libraries, firmware and device SELinux policy extensions. Other than some special cases like the emulator, the generic targets rely on the device support code present on the device. Shipping all of this is necessary for full security updates and is tied to enabling verified
05:15:29 <Dylanger[m]> boot / attestation. Pixel targets have a lot of device-specific hardening in the AOSP base along with some in GrapheneOS which needs to be ported over too. For example, various security features in the kernel including type-based Control Flow Integrity (CFI) and the shadow call stack are currently specific to the kernels for these devices.
05:15:29 <Dylanger[m]> Taken from the build doc, sums everything up pretty well
05:16:21 <strcat[m]> danascape: it also needs to support locking the bootloader, enabling verified boot, using attestation for Auditor, etc.
05:16:37 <strcat[m]> danascape: and no I see no way for us to support a device that core developers do not own
05:17:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> Doesn't oneplus have a little broken verified boot support?
05:17:39 <strcat[m]> and I'm only interested in supporting the latest iteration of a device with at minimum ~2.5 years support left
05:17:48 <strcat[m]> it takes substantial effort to do it
05:18:08 <danascape[m]> <strcat[m] "danascape: and no I see no way f"> I understand
05:18:12 <strcat[m]> we already lack resources to properly support existing devices
05:18:21 <danascape[m]> <strcat[m] "we already lack resources to pro"> like ?
05:18:22 <strcat[m]> bunch of outstanding issues to address
05:18:23 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <o​sscontrib> Can anyone give me materials I can learn how to port GOS to another device? I wanna broaden the device support.
05:18:33 <strcat[m]> danascape: resolving all uncovered memory corruption bugs
05:18:42 <strcat[m]> getting all the security features working across devices including for the kernels
05:18:44 <strcat[m]> lots of things
05:19:39 <strcat[m]> so, you need to figure out if that device can actually have another device installed with verified boot enabled
05:19:52 <strcat[m]> among other things
05:19:58 <strcat[m]> lot of things that need to be checked
05:20:22 <strcat[m]> I assume it doesn't have a secure element, Weaver, etc. so that's a problem and docs would need to be updated to explain that some supported devices have weaker encryption, keystore, etc.
05:20:39 <strcat[m]> and https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption would need to be expanded to explain how the weaker approach without that works
05:20:57 <strcat[m]> which isn't ideal, it's already long
05:26:37 <danascape[m]> I won't be all talk, I'll show it when I'm done 😅😅
05:35:52 <Dylanger[m]> I think a requirement is no GSI as well
05:37:26 <danascape[m]> <Dylanger[m] "I think a requirement is no GSI "> What's the codename for mi11 ?
05:37:31 <danascape[m]> lmi?
05:38:11 <Dylanger[m]> Venus I think
05:38:43 <Dylanger[m]> https://github.com/MiCode/Xiaomi_Kernel_OpenSource/tree/venus-r-oss
05:38:52 <danascape[m]> I see
05:40:07 <Dylanger[m]> So if you compile the generic arm64 build target, whack that into a Mi 11, everything works bar a few small things
05:40:26 <Dylanger[m]> Keeping in mind this is for testing/play

07:39:10 <Blechpirat[m]> Is there any other app that can access an exchange server?
07:39:36 <Blechpirat[m]> preferably without 14 trackers (like microsofts outlook)?
07:41:15 <Anna-Elise[m]> Do you only need mail?
07:41:25 <Blechpirat[m]> mail and calendar
07:41:42 <Blechpirat[m]> contacts would be very nice, but not a must-have
07:42:41 <Pratyush[m]> Canary Mail as paid option or fairmail free option
07:43:22 <Blechpirat[m]> fairmail does not support Exchange. I tried, it only talks with exchange via imap/pop, which my work exchange has disabled.
07:43:46 <Blechpirat[m]> will check canary, thank you.
07:46:40 <Pratyush[m]> <Blechpirat[m] "fairmail does not support Exchan"> imap is disabled then you need oAuth way to access your mail and in that case canary mail or any other mail client with oAuth support should work if third party mail client is disabled for security reasonyou can only use web app of outlook
07:47:25 <Blechpirat[m]> I was just googling Canary Mail and it says: "Canary doesn’t support Exchange ActiveSync".
07:47:39 <Blechpirat[m]> Not sure if that is important.
07:48:43 <snowlynx[m]> Hi, does the pixel 4a support laptop docking stations? I have a dell wd15 which is a docking station working with thunderbolt, I connect to it a monitor with hdmi and keyboard+mouse with usb. It looks like mouse and keyboard will work from what I find, but what about the monitor? Will it work?
07:49:03 <snowlynx[m]> With Grapheneos of course
07:49:49 <snowlynx[m]> The idea is to use the phone as desktop when home
07:53:25 <Pratyush[m]> Blechpirat  your best bet is webapp.

07:54:34 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Hey there, i got a question
07:56:10 <Pratyush[m]> Why not, what's your questions?
07:56:12 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Will authoritys be able to get access to my phone data if it gets seized? I know it only takes Them a couple minutes to get into a stock Android device, and i know iPhones (old models 6,7&8) take them very long but its possible for Them
07:56:43 <Blechpirat[m]> Pratyush: Thank you. That is a bit disappointing, as that would not allow my to sync my work calendar - which i doing the pandemic probably the most imporant feature :)
07:56:51 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Is grapheneos safer than a New iPhone in that Perspektive.
07:56:54 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> ?*
07:59:41 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> No, pixel does not support Video output as far as i know, at least not on pixel 3
07:59:47 <Pratyush[m]> Well this is different type of questions may be #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  but if there a section dedicated to this question on graphene website
08:00:12 <Pratyush[m]> * Well this is different type of questions may be #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org  but there is a section dedicated to this question on graphene website
08:00:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> OK i need Matrix client to join right?
08:01:22 <snowlynx[m]> <strcat[m] "it's supported in general but no"> Thank you, too bad, and there are no plans to add it? Btw it's not working either with a samsung galaxy a series, I think it's only with devices supporting dex. A pixel with grapheneos woult be an awesome desktop os!
08:01:27 <Pratyush[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Jeremy> OK i need Matrix clien"> no telegram group is also available in my knowledge
08:02:17 <Pratyush[m]> @grapheneosofftopic
08:02:37 <Blechpirat[m]> Another question, if you guys don't mind: I read that people put a phone number into the esim on stock rom, then flash graphene and the number still works. is that still true/necessary to get two numbers on graphene?
08:03:51 <Pratyush[m]> yes
08:04:39 <Pratyush[m]> graphene and aosp both have build in support for eSIM but eSIM manage app is google closed sources one
08:05:47 <Blechpirat[m]> thanks.
08:06:50 <Blechpirat[m]> So I might reflash the stock rom, trial FairEmail (if it can read/write outlook, buy), put the # into esim, reflash graphene.
08:07:29 <Blechpirat[m]> but then I still have an app that I have to rip the apk of my phone and copy to the new one, without any way to get updates on the email client.
08:07:42 <Blechpirat[m]> does not sound very secure to me... :(
08:10:02 <Pratyush[m]> <Blechpirat[m] "but then I still have an app tha"> ??
08:11:09 <Blechpirat[m]> Well, without the play store, how do I get FairMail on my Grapheneos-driven phone?
08:11:29 <Blechpirat[m]> I would intstall on a stock rom, and then copy the apk to the graphene phone.
08:11:32 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> FairEmail (Voll ausgestatteter E-Mail-Client. Saubere intuitive Oberfläche. Mit Datenschutz) - https://f-droid.org/packages/eu.faircode.email
08:11:53 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Fdroid i guess
08:12:04 <Blechpirat[m]> the frdroid version does not support oauth.
08:12:22 <Blechpirat[m]> thats a paid feature.
08:13:07 <Pratyush[m]> Blechpirat  Fairmail is also on f-droid and aurora store is always your friends to get apps and update
08:13:07 <Pratyush[m]> Also apps update is not graphene security issue you have to make sure you are getting apps from good sources and keeping it up to date.
08:13:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Aurora store then
08:13:42 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Sign in with your own E-Mail Adress and purchased apps should Be shown
08:13:48 <Pratyush[m]> Blechpirat  f-droid version have paid options built in
08:14:14 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!Jeremy> Blechpirat u german?
08:14:52 <Pratyush[m]> <GrapheneOS-Teleg "<!Jeremy> Sign in with your own "> not good way,  play store purchases required play store og client to verify purchases  not even microg can help
08:15:00 <Blechpirat[m]> I'm german :)
08:17:41 <Blechpirat[m]> Just checked again: The fdroid version of FairEmail does NOT support oauth.
08:17:48 <christhepanda[m]> Jeremy, a few good precautions are to turn on lockdown mode in areas where authorities are common i.e. protests, rallies, ports, etc. Make sure your pin number is 12 digits long. If you are worried about authoritues siezing yiur device, use fuest mid@

10:34:11 <helloworldkk87[m> Would not use APKmirror, would rather use Aurora Store. And no most of them wont work on GrapheneOS as they need GooglePlayServices. But many of them do work. And apps cant track your location uneless ypu grant them permission to do so.
10:35:27 <helloworldkk87[m> For camera Open Camera seems to be best but I dont take photos myself so dont know
10:38:00 <helloworldkk87[m> And for maps I really dont know as I use paper map and compass (Dont worry I live in Finland its normal here)
10:41:16 <helloworldkk87[m> Also there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org room
10:48:10 <bigben33[m]> Is this the wrong room to ask?
10:53:44 <helloworldkk87[m> Kinda yes. This room is only about the project
12:56:15 <battery-staple-h> Hi grapheneos! Thanks very much for your work. I've been using your os for the last 6 months or so. I wanted to use a this really cool plant identification app (plantnet) but the developer only appears to publish their app on the play store. If I install it with aurora store and use the “only while using the app” permission options, would the
12:56:15 <battery-staple-h> app be restricted by these grapheneos enforced permissions? Is there anything I should be aware of using the aurora store to get apks? I didn’t want to use the random apk mirror websites as I can’t tell if they contain malware. Thanks
13:00:56 <rny[m]> graphene os replies: thanks.
13:01:19 <strcat[m]> battery-staple-h: unclear what you're really asking
13:01:31 <strcat[m]> every app is sandboxed and the permission model, etc. is how you control what apps can access
13:01:36 <strcat[m]> if you don't grant the access, they don't have it
13:02:58 <battery-staple-h> ok thanks that helps. I don't know much about how it all works so I wanted to double check there's no difference with apps from play store. I've only been using self published and f droid so far
13:03:11 <battery-staple-h> I will give it a go
13:03:35 <battery-staple-h> thanks again for the work
13:47:20 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> Is there any recommended / best way to get Aurora Store? AFAIK It's available on f-droid (via that client or an alternative one) and on Github?
14:06:08 <Blechpirat[m]> aurora store was preinstalled on mine
14:07:25 <strcat[m]> companies selling GrapheneOS phones might bundle it but it's not bundled in GrapheneOS itself
14:08:12 <vikingstudiosz[m> hey
14:12:08 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!X> Forgot to mention another source, i.d. the AuroraOS-website, so I quote myself for completeness' sake. 😉So any recommendations on where best to get it from?

16:00:53 <Lumi> Hello. :)
16:03:31 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Mangesh has joined the Telegram Group!
16:05:39 <Lumi> I have a quick question about GrapheneOS. I've read that Google has disabled video output through the Pixels' USB-C port. GrapheneOS is not affected by this problem, is it?
16:05:39 <Lumi> Indeed, I want to be able to use my smartphone as a small computer by connecting it to a screen, keyboard and mouse via a small adapter.
16:19:40 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> !Ryan has joined the Telegram Group!
16:43:36 <TheJollyRoger> Hello Lumi, GrapheneOS hasn't changed that from the factory operating system. If you have a patch that reenables it, those are welcome for review!
16:44:52 <Lumi> Okay. Thanks for the information. :)
16:45:07 <chile09[m]> Is it recommended to use the cell network with GrapheneOS, or should it be avoided altogether
16:46:01 <hypokeimenon[m]> Avoid it on all operating systems if possible.
16:49:26 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: GrapheneOS always treats the network as hostile, regardless of what physical layer you use.
16:49:58 <TheJollyRoger> You can use Airplane Mode if you don't want to.
16:51:52 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: I highly recommend you think out a proper threat model and start planning for it and consider the specific venues you're trying to plan for in detail before you try to ask "is something safe?" It will go a lot further to getting you something you feel confident in, because if you haven't done this, you will never feel confident in what you use, no matter how many hoops you jump
16:51:53 <TheJollyRoger> through.
16:55:17 <dazinism> catfish: @snowlynx:matrix.orgcan see incognito tabs via displaylink if you toggle chrome://flags/#incognito-screenshot in vanadium
18:00:58 <ziq> Does anyone use Aegis for OTP? On my Pixel 4 the biometric unlock is grayed out. Anyone encountered that problem?
18:07:06 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: I highly recommend you "> If the SIM card is inserted and the device is authenticated with the cell network provider, they will retain the IMEI and IMSI and GPS coordiantes of the device connected to cell tower X is this correct?
18:07:38 <chile09[m]> The system will retain unique data specific to the device itself
18:10:20 <chile09[m]> and that will be associated with you identity in the database
18:10:46 <chile09[m]> name, phone number, billing etc
18:11:06 <chile09[m]> So probably best to avoid cell networks altogether

18:31:41 <m2tu[m]> i just flashed pixel 3A
18:32:15 <m2tu[m]> i see the kernel version says  4.9.237-dirty ???
18:32:35 <m2tu[m]> what does that means ?
18:33:12 <TheJollyRoger> danascape[m]: Woah, that's awesome! Cheers to you shipmate!
18:33:54 <danascape[m]> <TheJollyRoger "danascape: Woah, that's awesome!"> thanks
18:34:07 <danascape[m]> I have 2 more devices, will build and boot on those soon
18:34:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah man!
18:35:09 <m2tu[m]> TheJollyRoger:   Flashed pixel 3A and it says   Kernel version 4.9.237-dirty
18:35:11 <m2tu[m]> is that normal ?
18:35:17 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Yeah, if that's in your threat model, you can use Airplane mode; the code for the WiFi and the Cellular Radio is separately sandboxed, so you just need to switch the WiFi back on.
18:35:26 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: on your own builds?
18:35:45 <m2tu[m]> TheJollyRoger: yes
18:36:30 <chile09[m]> ok so airplane mode with SIM card in blocks the cell radio and then you turn wifi on right
18:37:27 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m]: Got it, I think you have to set the naming options in the kernel configuration, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that, unfortunately.
18:38:20 <m2tu[m]> ok thanks, mostly wanted to know if its normal or danger or soemthing like that
18:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: Yes, when you turn on airplane mode it will shut down the cell radio, but you can turn WiFi back on without needing to turn on cell network along with it. This allows you to function on WiFi only; MAC address randomization on GrapheneOS is on by default.
18:38:39 <TheJollyRoger> m2tu[m], yeah, there should be options you'll be able to set in the configuration but I forget which ones they are.
18:39:22 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: Yes, when you turn on a"> Thank you very much
18:39:32 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
18:39:51 <chile09[m]> What to do if there are issues charging the battery
18:40:06 <chile09[m]> plug it in but the battery doesn't charge it goes down
18:40:15 <TheJollyRoger> So, with respect to power management on GrapheneOS: the best thing you can do is use the power cable and the charger it came wit, but...
18:40:40 <TheJollyRoger> I should note that the USB C slot is physically very fragile, if any part of your phone is going to break from regular wear and tear, it's the USB slot.
18:40:44 <TheJollyRoger> Especially if any water splashes into the slot.
18:41:10 <TheJollyRoger> So, chile09[m], first check with the cable that it came with and see if you can wiggle it around a little bit. If it's intermittent, then you know your USB slot is damaged.
18:41:50 <TheJollyRoger> If you can, try charging it using an induction charger, and see if that works.
18:42:20 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: I know that on the 3, 4, and 5, the phone is advertised as being IP68 water resistant, but the USB slot is most definitely not water-resistant.
18:42:45 <TheJollyRoger> If any water splashes in, you must turn the phone so that the USB port is facing straight down, then blow into it as hard as you can to blast as much water out as possible.
18:43:24 <TheJollyRoger> Something you might try as a last resort is to clean it out using a tooth brush, but be careful: the little traces on there can be quite easily damaged.
18:43:46 <TRJ> hi, anyone have a good email/google calendar setup? I have tested a bunch of apps on the aurora store, to address my challenges using google calendars and emails (for work), with personal email (protonmail) and personal calendar.
18:43:46 <TRJ> I do have a personal nextcloud server setup, which I could leverage, but i still have not figure out a good way to set up both work and personal email. It seems I cannot get emails to be viewable from a single client NOR am I able to consolidate personal and google calendars easily on one calendar view.
18:43:47 <TRJ> Does anyone have any luck with this at all?
18:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> Hello TRJ, ha, looks like we have the same initials.
18:44:20 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Something you might try as a las"> And toothpaste. Careful with the toothpaste.

18:44:54 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: be really careful with using toothpaste, or any water on the USB, there's only a very thin rubber gasket around the USB slot. Any water gets in, and the USB is toast.
18:45:09 <TheJollyRoger> I wouldn't recommend it.

18:45:50 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: that's indeed what I had to do on my Pixel 3.
18:46:27 <TheJollyRoger> TRJ: so, with respect to using google applications on GrapheneOS, since GrapheneOS considers play services to be invasive, they aren't bundled. So although some users have reported Google Maps to work because strangely enough it doesn't phone home to Google via Play Services, some other Google apps may be dependent on Play Services and have no fallback or code to function in their absence.
18:46:34 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jj1013.: that's indeed what I ha"> Was it easy for you...?
18:46:47 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: no, I had to take it to UBreakIFix.

18:47:53 <TheJollyRoger> The Pixel 3s are glued shut, and the screen is REALLY fragile - a friend of mine learned this the hard way when he accidentally drove the pad of his finger into the back of the screen by mistake and crumpled the fragile little plastic wafer. Wrecked the screen.
18:48:33 <TheJollyRoger> So I wasn't willing to take the risk myself.
18:48:58 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "jj1013.: no, I had to take it to"> Welp. I guess I should just go to the repair store my uncle went to. The phone supposedly ended up flawless, but we do not count on repair stores here at Venezuela normally. They fuck up our phones. Badly.

18:49:21 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So, with respect to power manage"> Hi, swapped the after market USB-C power cable with the factory and its charging quickly now; I'm afraid Big G is copying Apple's cable adherence
18:49:37 <TRJ> TheJollyRoger, et al.  Anyone find an app that can handle multiple email accounts and also calendars (I tried Outlook, it crashes, Spike (it's paid and weird), Spark (no calendar)....
18:49:59 <chile09[m]> you must use cable X or it simply will not work etc..
18:50:00 <TheJollyRoger> TRJ: both K-9 Mail and FairEmail can handle multiple E-mail accounts quite well and they do IMAP IDLE, so you get notifications as they come in.
18:50:18 <jj1013[m]> <chile09[m] "Hi, swapped the after market USB"> As far as it works and it is open enough for Graphene folks to harden it, it is perfect.
18:50:42 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: There is a reason for this: it's because most third-party vendors simply cut corners wherever they please. Remember that USB is an extremely complex protocol, and in order to determine which device charges what, that negotiation must take place over software.
18:51:00 <TheJollyRoger> This is because Android Phones can charge each other - again, that negotiation takes place in software.
18:51:12 <TheJollyRoger> If the cable doesn't have the proper wires to do that, then that negotiation won't happen.
18:51:19 <TheJollyRoger> Or if those wires or traces are broken.
18:52:04 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "This is because Android Phones c"> So if I make a program developed for such a thing, we could have digital string phones?
18:52:31 <TheJollyRoger> TRJ: there are some calendar apps that also work well; some users, myself included, have found Simple Calendar to work well and is compatible with Seedvault Backups, although note that Simple Calendar does not use the calendar API in Android, but instead stores its data within itself.
18:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: Heh, of course you could.
18:53:42 <troypatrick[m]> Anyone have problems with element.io crashing sometimes on grapheneOS?
18:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: the days when power cables were simply a dumb connector to a DC main are dead, and gone.
18:54:00 <troypatrick[m]> When resetting security keys/creating new passphrase
18:54:32 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: There is a reason for t"> Thanks for your answer I wasn't aware there was any standardized protocol used for charging, just assumed because there is no data transfer that it was just moving electrons into the cathode or anode of the battery
18:55:14 <TheJollyRoger> troypatrick[m]: if you're having an issue you could capture a bug report. Element has its own through "rage shaking", although GrapheneOS can allow you to capture a "tombstone" via developer options. The tombstone is a plain text file you can browse and read yourself in any text editor, but before you send it in, you should check to make sure that it doesn't contain anything you don't want to
18:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> be made public.
18:56:22 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: yeah, it's not that simple anymore. Remember that you can charge one android phone from another android phone (this is what lead to the slang term "pop tart" here in this channel), but in order for that to happen, the phone charging the other and the phone being charged off it have to negotiate and agree on which one charges which before the electrons flow.
18:58:56 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "troypatrick: if you're having an"> Rage shaking seems unaccurate to me or the phone just can not detect how am I shaking exactly. Even though I set it at "high", it is incredibly sensitive, however, this is offtopic, so I may as well just keep this opinion in a single message.
18:59:04 <TheJollyRoger> (For context, if anyone is unsure of what people in this channel meanwhen they say "pop tart" it's a term for an old or useless phone that's reached the end of its service life and is now insecure or otherwise useless except as a cheap improvised powerpack. So much like real Kellogg pop tarts, they're good for supplying quick energy but have little if any real nutritional value.)
18:59:07 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: ah, got it.
18:59:13 <TheJollyRoger> *channel means when
18:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> *mean when
19:00:53 <chile09[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: yeah, it's not that sim"> yeah makes sense seems like it could be an attack surface somehow; what's poptart?
19:02:34 <TheJollyRoger> chile09[m]: A pop tart is a kind of toaster pastry, they're heavily sugared and have a very controversial reputation for being nutritionally useless despite being loaded with calories - the term "pop tart" in GrapheneOS lexicon refers to a phone that's similarly useless except for its energy.
19:03:41 <chile09[m]> that's amazingly descriptive thank you
19:03:45 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
19:08:12 <jj1013[m]> <TheJollyRoger "chile09: A pop tart is a kind of">  You can choose which phone charges which? Wow.
19:09:19 <curiouscode1010[> Hello
19:15:50 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
19:16:44 <TheJollyRoger> jj1013[m]: yes, you can choose to charge an android handset with another android handset and vice-versa.
19:17:16 <TheJollyRoger> Older ones don't support this, but newer ones do.
19:17:58 <P-G> TheJollyRoger: did you notice those messages I sent the other day, referencing Github places that might be useful?
19:18:20 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: Ah, whoops, yes, I did get your messages, sorry about that!
19:18:25 <P-G> No worries.
19:18:33 <P-G> I'm not sure what else to do at this point though.
19:19:09 <TheJollyRoger> I did have a look, but unfortunately I don't do Java well enough to be able to do anything but guess at what those functions are, and I dislike guessing because a lot of the time if I take a guess, I'm generally wrong!
19:19:18 <P-G> Normally I would add some debug logging and recompile but that's a fair amount of work in this case.
19:19:24 <P-G> Yeah, I don't know Java either.
19:19:45 <P-G> Should I just open an issue about this on Github?
19:19:47 <TheJollyRoger> Well... again, I dislike guessing but it might be dependent on carrier. I can try to see if I can flag down someone who knows more than I.
19:20:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, please, I'll tag it with "Question."
19:20:21 <P-G> It does seem related to the phone's network options, but I'm not sure if the carrier is the only factor there.
19:20:42 <P-G> Also no idea what to do about that. >.<
19:21:12 <P-G> Hiding this setting does seem intentional but I have no idea why.
19:21:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... what goes on at the carrier is not something we can generally control :(.
19:21:22 <TheJollyRoger> Well, at least, not from our seat.
19:21:40 <TheJollyRoger> Or yours!
19:21:43 <P-G> My carrier is working though, so I think this is a phone-side problem (or feature).
19:21:58 <P-G> I just don't understand it.
19:22:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm... you're the second person I can remember who's asked about the LTE Only option not appearing in Network Options. Post your findings and maybe open an issue. I'll triage it as a question, hopefully someone might be able to answer.
19:23:01 <TheJollyRoger> *In Options under Mobile Network
19:24:02 <P-G> Ok. Hopefully it's something intentional but from a user standpoint this is pretty confusing.
19:24:14 <TheJollyRoger> Understandable. I'll keep an eye out!
19:24:23 <P-G> But I can't post issues on that repo. :S
19:24:37 <TheJollyRoger> There should be an OS issue tracker, one moment...
19:25:33 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues If you haven't got a github account, I can post one on your behalf.
19:25:40 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment and let me just do a bit of searching.
19:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> I don't want to open a duplicate.
19:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> Just sit tight for a sec.
19:26:10 <P-G> No results for "lteonly".
19:26:21 <nscnt[m]> might be a carrier-specific issue
19:26:23 <P-G> Some for "lte only".
19:26:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, looks like I don't see any that hit those keywords yet.
19:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> Go ahead, P-G
19:28:33 <TheJollyRoger> I have to step away from my desk for a little bit, but I'll be back later on. See you guys soon.
19:28:44 <P-G> Ok. Thanks.
19:29:46 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, just dropped back a second...
19:29:57 <TheJollyRoger> P-G: if you run into trouble posting that issue, let me know and I will send it in on your behalf.
19:30:38 <P-G> Ok. I should be able to post it but the format might not be pretty since I hardly know what I'm talking about. :p
19:31:17 <TheJollyRoger> If you'd like me to take a look at it before you send it in, I will when I get back to my desk.
19:32:07 <P-G> No, I'm not that worried about my appearance. I'll send you a link. Just let me know if I should change anything when you have time.
19:32:24 <braxtono[m]> Is a PWA like WebApp more secure for banking, social media in a secondary profile vs native apps ?
19:32:26 <TheJollyRoger> You can PM it to me although sometimes Matrix has a nasty habit of accepting messages and then eating them instead of delivering them to the other side of the IRC bridge, so if I don't reply by the next day, then it may have gotten lost and just resend it.
19:32:38 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
19:32:46 <TheJollyRoger> Be back soon.
19:33:22 <braxtono[m]> On LTE only I get data no SMS
20:01:48 <Guest35> hi
20:22:36 <user1182[m]> Hi, if I want to revert my GrapheneOS pixel back to stock, is there a web-based way to do so? Is there a way to go through the web installer instructions but use the stock image instead?
20:23:49 <sphinx[m]> user1182: https://developers.google.com/android/images
20:29:22 <kepoff[m]> <user1182[m] "Hi, if I want to revert my Graph"> You can also use the flashing tool provided by Google: https://flash.android.com/welcome
20:30:42 <user1182[m]> thanks guys. Will I still need to do that additional step GrapheneOS lists, the "remove non stock key"?
20:30:46 <sphinx[m]> clicking 'Flash' next to the image for the device leads there
20:31:02 <kepoff[m]> <sphinx[m] "clicking 'Flash' next to the ima"> just noticed that, my bad
20:39:19 <sphinx[m]> user1182: it's not like it's absolutely needed but yes, ideally use GrapheneOS' web installer to do that step before locking
20:42:09 <user1182[m]> thank you!
20:46:17 <christhepanda[m]> Is there a way for me to send a file to my phone?
21:02:58 <christhepanda[m]> * .
21:55:21 <b1101> after being on graphene since Januray, I can't ever see myself going back to stock.
21:56:09 <b1101> I used lineage until that point, and even that would be a huge step backward
22:02:20 <ProteinScape1> I have 2 projects involving Android to work on here
22:02:21 <ProteinScape1> 1. I want to send a text message to every single phone number on Earth.
22:02:21 <ProteinScape1> +0 000 000 0000, +1 001 001 0001 To generate a list of every possible phone number and country code
22:02:22 <ProteinScape1> I want to import the list of phone numbers, and type a custom message
22:02:22 <ProteinScape1> and then have the phone send 1 sms message, to every number in the list
22:02:23 <ProteinScape1> Can you help me program this
22:02:23 <ProteinScape1> I can pay you =)
22:03:30 <jess> err
22:05:58 <christhepanda[m]> Now that would be expensive.
22:06:10 <TheJollyRoger> Hi jess. Judging by the stylometry and contents of that message, that's an old harasser that was banned repeatedly, but keeps trying to evade the bans with dynamic IPs and VPNs, each time coming back as a new nickname and pretending to be a new user.
22:06:21 <jess> ah
22:06:26 <jess> i'll keep the ban in place then
22:06:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:06:42 <jess> let me know if you get evasion problems again
22:07:22 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks. It looks like they post via VPNs, but I'm not sure which VPNs to ban without causing some amount of collateral damage.
22:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> This user's been an ongoing problem since last winter, but each time I put a ban in place they must simply get another VPN exit.
22:08:27 <jess> sometimes you need someone that can play whackamole for a bit, who's got the right buttons to press to make it easy
22:08:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
22:08:44 <jess> looks like they've using Air VPN
22:09:32 <Thatcher[m]> <b1101 "after being on graphene since Ja"> Same here
22:09:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Wonder if there's a way to block that easily from here, without causing too much collateral damage.
22:10:24 <christhepanda[m]> After being on graphene for 2 days, I can say that it is better than ios.
22:10:34 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back in a bit, sorry!
22:12:49 <jess> TheJollyRoger: Air VPN users that aren't using the webchat have @gateway/vpn/airvpn/ in their cloaks
22:13:00 <jess> webchat doesn't, but that's probably a lot of IPs to ban
22:26:38 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> deny (@d​eny2311) has joined the Telegram Group!
22:29:07 <axx> I've been experiencing an annoying bug, wonder if anyone else has it too: when typing on the stock keyboard in a different language, the spell checker works on words as they are being typed, but as soon as one gets to the next word, the spell checker analyses them as if they were English (my system's default language) and therefore wants to correct them to something else / offers no useful correction for mistyped words
23:21:33 <braxtono[m]> Is a PWA like WebApp more secure for banking, social media in a secondary profile vs native apps ?
