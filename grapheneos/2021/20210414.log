01:07:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Nevermind.
02:45:40 <timetravelingman> Howdy lads. May I be unbanned from grapheneos-offtopic?
02:45:40 <timetravelingman> Best,
02:45:40 <timetravelingman> timetravelingman
03:10:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> timetravelingman: pm me and explain what happened
05:17:49 <sentience[m]> Is there no way to quickly hard lock the phone? Feels like this should be an obvious feature built into a secure/privacy focused os :/
05:19:11 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <!yume> Can you explain what u mean with hard lock?
05:19:35 <strcat> sentience[m]: press the power button? not clear what you mean...
05:19:44 <strcat> by default power button locks instantly
05:19:47 <strcat> what do you mean 'hard lock'?
05:20:10 <strcat> you say something is an obvious feature but it's not clear what you actually want
05:20:20 <strcat> I recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
05:21:55 <sentience[m]> Thought it was obvious, but what I mean by "hardlock" is to force password to unlock. Not for instance a fingerprint.
05:23:12 <sentience[m]> This also happens every time you restart your phone, requiring pass instead of an other methods (that are faster, like fingerprint)
05:23:20 <strcat> there's a lockdown action
05:23:27 <strcat> which only disables secondary unlock
05:23:31 <strcat> not the same thing as end session / reboot
05:23:39 <strcat> please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
05:23:43 <strcat> lots of information available on the site
05:23:52 <strcat> lockdown action is not particularly useful but is available
05:24:15 <strcat> doesn't impact the standard disk encryption which is why it's not mentioned there unlike end session
05:24:27 <strcat> a section on the keystore or lock methods more generally would cover it
05:27:03 <strcat[m]> lockdown is a standard AOSP feature, you're free to enable it and use it, but as I said not as useful as end session / reboot
05:27:18 <sentience[m]> Are you saying that there is a way I can disable fingerprint unlock/require password to unlock with a given hotkey/button?
05:27:25 <strcat[m]> end session / reboot clears encryption keys from memory/registers and puts profiles back at rest
05:27:28 <strcat[m]> sentience: yes, lockdown feature
05:27:29 <strcat[m]> as I said
05:27:38 <strcat[m]> feel free to use it
05:27:40 <strcat[m]> standard AOSP feature
05:27:44 <strcat[m]> well documented elsewhere
05:27:52 <strcat[m]> we don't document everything to do with standard features
05:27:58 <strcat[m]> we focus on documenting our changes
05:29:34 <sentience[m]> Gotcha, thank you for your help.
05:35:54 <sentience[m]> strcat  My  only trouble here is that its like you said, the same process to just shutdown phone as it is to lockdown it. If I were in an emergency situation where seconds  mattered, being able to press my power button say 5times quickly to auto activate lockdown (or even power off) would be very beneficial, and much more stealthy as you don't even need to look at the phone to do so. Unless I am missing something
05:35:54 <sentience[m]> that already allows me to do this.
05:36:15 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier
05:36:21 <strcat[m]> lockdown is not as good as end session or reboot
05:36:31 <strcat[m]> we are unlikely to make a quicker shortcut for something that's not really advisable to use
05:36:47 <strcat[m]> I don't see how pressing the power button 5 times is superior
05:37:08 <sentience[m]> Is there a fast way to end session/reboot?
05:37:27 <strcat[m]> power -> reboot, end session is easier since there's a button on the homescreen for it too
05:38:04 <strcat[m]> I don't think disabling secondary unlock is really what people want in an 'emergency' situation
05:38:10 <strcat[m]> rather they probably want to reboot
05:43:29 <sentience[m]> Whether its lockdown/power off/reboot, I am not able to activate these without having to pull out my phone from my pocket, look at my phone, press/hold power, then tap my choice, which you may even then misclick because there is multiple options. Like in iOS, all is necessary is to put hand in pocket, press power button rapidly 5timss and you have successfully done it, in a lot less time. This is a feature I find
05:43:29 <sentience[m]> critical for to have.
05:43:51 <strcat[m]> the iOS feature only disables secondary unlock
05:43:55 <strcat[m]> does not put data at rest
05:44:10 <strcat[m]> sentience: you can already disable it without taking the phone out of your pocket
05:44:15 <strcat[m]> you know you can just fail to unlock 5 times?
05:44:21 <strcat[m]> use fingerprint scanner several times with wrong finger
05:44:23 <strcat[m]> there you go
05:44:27 <strcat[m]> we cap max attempts at 5
05:45:45 <strcat[m]> just because iOS does something does not mean it is the best way to do it, we are more interested in a shortcut that puts all data for all profiles at rest than something like this
05:45:53 <strcat[m]> there is already a way to do that
05:46:55 <sentience[m]> Whether it puts data at rest or not isn't really my what I'm getting at, its the idea of quickly securing your device. Also TRY to use wrong fingerprint 5times quickly lol, it delays after each one and takes about 8-10 seconds to accomplish. Hitting say pbutton 5timss takes 2ish seconds
05:47:28 <strcat[m]> no it doesn't have that kind of delay
05:47:54 <strcat[m]> there's already a standard shortcut for the power button so we can't do what you're asking, sorry
05:48:02 <strcat[m]> just because iOS does something does not mean it's the best way to do it
05:48:24 <strcat[m]> if you aren't familiar with how things work and what has already been considered then please familiarize yourself first before giving suggestions
05:48:30 <strcat[m]> please read the docs and issue tracker 1st
05:48:41 <strcat[m]> suggestions after you understand what is implemented and what has been considered
05:48:42 <strcat[m]> not before
05:48:59 <sentience[m]> I agree, iOS does not do a lot of things right, I like grapheme is, but its just weird to me that there's no real solid way to secure the device in a timely manner is all.
05:49:06 <strcat[m]> there is
05:49:15 <sentience[m]> * I agree, iOS does not do a lot of things right, I like graphene os, but its just weird to me that there's no real solid way to secure the device in a timely manner is all.
05:49:22 <strcat[m]> and I don't see how disabling secondary unlock is all you consider to be 'securing' the device
05:49:25 <strcat[m]> doesn't make sense to me
05:49:35 <strcat[m]> suggest dropping it, not going anywhere, and you suggestion isn't valid
05:49:42 <strcat[m]> there's already a shortcut conflicting with that
05:49:52 <strcat[m]>  * suggest dropping it, not going anywhere, and your suggestion isn't valid
05:50:11 <strcat[m]> it would have to use something like volume and it would probably be reboot we'd want to add a shortcut for, not that
05:50:40 <strcat[m]> also does no good to come up with the idea unless someone is going to implement it
05:50:48 <strcat[m]> plenty of great ideas filed on our issue tracker since 2015/2016/2017
05:50:54 <strcat[m]> that's where most of the good ideas on it are from
05:50:57 <sentience[m]> Sure I am down for anyway, to secure it fast. I guess lockdown wasn't exactly the thing I was looking for.
05:51:03 <strcat[m]> does no good without developers interested in implementing it
05:51:08 <strcat[m]> sentience: reboot is the most useful
05:51:10 <strcat[m]> puts all profiles at rest
05:51:21 <strcat[m]> lockdown only disables secondary unlock
05:51:48 <strcat[m]> so, lockdown helps secure keystore + makes it harder to unlock but the profiles are still active
05:51:55 <strcat[m]> OS still has encryption keys for any that are active
05:52:09 <strcat[m]> if you're talking about a scenario with a sophisticated attacker then you want to reboot
05:52:18 <strcat[m]> end session is a nice convenience to keep stuff at rest during regular use
05:52:28 <strcat[m]> but in an emergency you probably just want to put all profiles at rest, not a specific one
05:52:52 <strcat[m]> and then if you're following our advice for a high security device, you can happily unlock the owner profile without your main data not being at rest
05:55:23 <strcat[m]> we have a lack of developers not a lack of ideas
05:55:29 <sentience[m]> I see, I haven't thought of it quite like that, appreciate your time in having this dialogue. Will be making some adjustment accordingly.
05:55:54 <strcat[m]> sentience: also see https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28
05:56:04 <strcat[m]> sentience: if we had that then what you're talking about wouldn't really be an issue in the first place
05:56:10 <strcat[m]> and the lockdown option would be pretty useless
05:56:16 <strcat[m]> and you'd only want a shortcut for reboot
05:57:07 <strcat[m]> the idea behind that is you can have a strong passphrase as main lock method and then secondary unlock via fingerprint + random 4 digit PIN (still 5 attempts max)
05:57:59 <strcat[m]> if you don't have a strong passphrase then you might as well just be using a random 6 digit PIN without using fingerprint unlock atm
05:58:34 <strcat[m]> even an attacker able to exploit the OS, etc. can't break decryption based on a random 6 digit PIN despite it being a weak source of entropy
05:58:44 <strcat[m]> they'd have to also be able to exploit the secure element, which is a lot harder
05:59:15 <strcat[m]> the only step up from that is a strong passphrase which combined with the scrypt + hardware-accelerated key derivation cannot be brute forced even by an attacker able to exploit secure element, etc.
05:59:36 <strcat[m]> but if it's anything short of strong enough for that, you're simply relying on the secure element anyway
06:02:43 <sentience[m]> * Whether it puts data at rest or not isn't really what I'm getting at, its the idea of quickly securing your device. Also TRY to use wrong fingerprint 5times quickly lol, it delays after each one and takes about 8-10 seconds to accomplish. Hitting say pbutton 5timss takes 2ish seconds

16:53:02 <snowlynx[m]> Hi, I was wondering if Grapheneos also offers better privacy towards my carrier. Is there any difference for the carrier if a person uses grapheneos vs stock android? I mean the information he can collect. Triangulation obviously cannot be avoided, but what about sent IMEI etc?
16:54:39 <TheJollyRoger> snowlynx[m]: GrapheneOS does not and will not implement privileged carrier drivers that some carriers insist on having. However, GrapheneOS cannot change a standard that's been agreed upon and is fundamental to how the cellular network works. Doing so would break cellular networking entirely.
16:59:04 <TheJollyRoger> jared_[m]: If you can detect the LeMobile Android Bootloader Interface in your device manager while the phone is on Fastboot mode, and it's detected and working properly (and the driver is installed, the driver is available as an optional update in Windows Update while the LeMobile Android Bootloader Interface is connected), then try again. If not, make sure you're using the Google branded
16:59:05 <TheJollyRoger> cable and it must be plugged into your motherboard directly; no hubs, no USB A to C adapters, no front ports allowed. If you lack USB C ports the best I can recommend you is an Anker or Aukey cable, because those have full traces including the wiring for low-level device debugging that most common USB-A to C cables simply don't have.
17:00:18 <TheJollyRoger> Most USB A to C cables are missing these wires because the vendors habitually pinch pennies and assume that people are only going to ever use the USB for charging and file transfer and nobody in their right mind would do functions like changing the operating system on their phone or talking to debugging interfaces.
17:00:38 <snowlynx[m]> <TheJollyRoger "snowlynx: GrapheneOS does not an"> So the only difference is about carrier drivers? I am going to read about it, no idea what carrier drivers are (like normal device drivers?).
17:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> If that still won't do it, likely the USB slots on your motherboard or your motherboard's firmware support for USB is broken or incomplete.
17:01:12 <TheJollyRoger> snowlynx[m]: With respect to the cellular networking protocol, GrapheneOS must do it the same way as the factory operating system, or you wouldn't get cell service.
17:02:35 <TheJollyRoger> snowlynx[m]: carrier device management drivers are highly privileged drivers that some (not all, but some) carriers such as Sprint make mandatory on devices in order to use their service. GrapheneOS users are not affected, so ignore this unless you are with Sprint or some carriers that do not allow you to bring your own device.
17:03:07 <TheJollyRoger> (GrapheneOS users are not affected)
17:04:46 <snowlynx[m]> I am not affected. So on the carrier side, it doesn't make a difference if someone is using grapheneos vs stock android regarding the data they can collect?
17:12:08 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to things like your IMEI and Subscriber number, we can't change that. You are free to use Airplane Mode which will stop the radio from reaching or being reached by the cell towers entirely, but of course that will leave you with no cell connectivity.
17:12:12 <TheJollyRoger> If we did change it, it'd be the equivalent of say, changing the wiring on your ethernet cable or cutting a few wires out.
17:12:22 <TheJollyRoger> You'd be essentially trying to change the way the cell network operates, at that point.
17:12:30 <TheJollyRoger> The developers at GrapheneOS can make it harder to exploit the operating system, preemptively mitigate exploits, implement new memory allocation which reduces memory fragmentation and prevents memory corruption vulnerabilities, harden the app runtime, and make the operating system more secure,
17:12:32 <TheJollyRoger> but we can't change globally agreed upon protocols without worldwide co-operation.
17:13:21 <grapheneos_user_> It's unfortunate that cellular networks are so insecure
17:13:41 <grapheneos_user_> On the other hand, it means I can set up a stingray and capture everyone's calls and texts
17:13:46 <grapheneos_user_> :P
17:14:07 <grapheneos_user_> Then get 3 and I can triangulate everyone
17:14:15 <grapheneos_user_> Even better
17:14:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, for this reason, GrapheneOS must consider the network to be hostile, and this is why all android apps since the late 2000's have enforced TLS/SSL to connect to their backend.
17:15:09 <grapheneos_user_> Cell tower triangulation is impossible to prevent unless you shoot a laser at the tower
17:15:14 <TheJollyRoger> Triangulation though, we can do nothing about, but I like to suggest a simple thought experiment; imagining writing a letter to someone you love, place it into an envelope with neither return address nor sender address. If I expected it to be delivered, that'd be silly.
17:15:35 <TheJollyRoger> Your cellular service provider must know where to route to, if they're going to get you service.
17:15:41 <grapheneos_user_> Triangulation is scary
17:15:48 <TheJollyRoger> If they don't know which towers to hand off to, you won't get service.
17:15:59 <grapheneos_user_> It cannot be prevented
17:16:02 <TheJollyRoger> Similarly, if you wanted to get home internet, your cable company must know which house they need to connect the wire to.
17:16:13 <grapheneos_user_> And you often need LTE for internet
17:16:18 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Similarly, if you wanted to get "> Yeah
17:16:27 <joltman[m]> At least it's not like China where you have to submit to facial recognition in order to get internet service
17:16:45 <TheJollyRoger> Yikes.
17:16:56 <grapheneos_user_> <joltman[m] "At least it's not like China whe"> The US isn't much better than China for mass surveillance
17:17:06 <grapheneos_user_> Except that the NSA probably has good intentions
17:17:31 <grapheneos_user_> Ngl I actually somewhat like the NSA
17:17:38 <TheJollyRoger> I'd like to avoid politics talk here, guys.
17:17:40 <grapheneos_user_> Sure, I don't like their mass surveillance
17:17:46 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "I'd like to avoid politics talk "> Ok
17:17:51 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks :)
17:19:16 <grapheneos_user_> Oh wait this isn't off topic channel
17:19:24 <joltman[m]> In theory, one could run GrapheneOS without cellular account and rely on public WiFi, VPN, and the MAC randomization. When connected, you could make digital calls.
17:19:32 <grapheneos_user_> <grapheneos_user_ "Oh wait this isn't off topic cha"> Was about to inadvertently derail it by mistake
17:19:40 <grapheneos_user_> With off topic stuff
17:20:37 <grapheneos_user_> <joltman[m] "In theory, one could run Graphen"> Better to use Tor
17:20:40 <TheJollyRoger> In theory, you could do just that - but remember that calls made to and from the legacy Publicly Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) are insecure no matter what you are connected to, because they hit the PSTN at some point or another. If you were to use an encrypted messaging app though, you'd be perfectly safe because again, Android has made it mandatory to enforce strict TLS.
17:20:42 <grapheneos_user_> Than vpn
17:21:25 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "In theory, you could do just tha"> Signal FTW
17:21:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yessir :)
17:21:55 <snowlynx[m]> Thanks. I am aware of the way cellular towers work and that you cannot change it, I was just wondering if there is some non essential data stock android usually sends
17:22:12 <TheJollyRoger> snowlynx[m]: At the cellular level? No.
17:22:21 <grapheneos_user_> TheJollyRoger: it makes me physically cringe whenever I see communication in movies
17:22:26 <grapheneos_user_> And money transfers
17:22:31 <TheJollyRoger> grapheneos_user_: Oh god yes.
17:22:35 <snowlynx[m]> <TheJollyRoger "In theory, you could do just tha"> Except they know where you are :)
17:23:08 <grapheneos_user_> <TheJollyRoger "Linux is the most secure operati"> Like, you're using accounts where a reversal is basically guaranteed, and everything can be traced
17:23:44 <grapheneos_user_> Then you use cellular networks where everyone can see what you're saying and when, plus you have no idea whether the person you're talking to is just a MitM
17:23:57 <grapheneos_user_> And you do this for illegal activities?
17:24:05 <grapheneos_user_> WHY???!!?!?!?????!!?!!!
17:24:29 <TheJollyRoger> snowlynx[m]: If you want to stop cell triangulation, turn on airplane mode, and you can still use WiFi. On GrapheneOS apps are fully sandboxed, at all times, and rely on the operating system to perform actions on their behalf like telling them the location or fine-grained location. MAC addresses are randomized on GrapheneOS.
17:27:53 <joltman[m]> In addition to turning on only WiFi and using VPN and taking advantage of default MAC randomization, I forgot to mention that one would be using an encrypted messaging or VOIP app like Signal. You could be traced to the access point, but if you avoided cameras, then I think that's about as close as they could get to identifying you.
17:30:04 <joltman[m]> There's almost always some level of privacy risk
17:30:50 <TheJollyRoger> Well, don't forget, accessing *any* type of information these days, is a transaction, you give some, to get some.
17:31:18 <TheJollyRoger> So it's a matter of what you want to pay, how you want to pay it, for what you want to get.
17:32:00 <snowlynx[m]> Makes perfect sense.
17:33:15 <joltman[m]> Agreed
17:33:26 <TheJollyRoger> So for instance, if you want to get cell service, your cellphone carrier must know which cellphone radio they're routing to and they have to know that you paid your bill on time and your account with them is in good standing.
17:33:43 <TheJollyRoger> They must know where that radio is, so they can hand off a tower to communicate with it.
17:34:00 <TheJollyRoger> Beyond that, they don't need to know much else and GrapheneOS doesn't give it to them.
17:34:10 <joltman[m]> Although they only need to know where that radio is while you're using it
17:34:12 <TheJollyRoger> But that said, neither do most handsets.
17:34:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, indeed! Otherwise they can't hand off the tower.
17:35:20 <snowlynx[m]> Of course, the problem is the forced linking of the sim card to an identity in many "free" and "democratic" (haha) societies
17:38:58 <joltman[m]> Maybe using a burner sim would help to circumvent that a little. It becomes a question of how much trouble do you want to go through to get more privacy.
17:40:30 <TheJollyRoger> You could spend $700 each time you wanted to get a new contextual identity, but I don't see the point of that.
17:40:45 <TheJollyRoger> *to get a new phone for each contextual identity,
17:41:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ultimately, it's up to you as to whether or not you want to use cell phone service.
17:41:40 <joltman[m]> I could dream up a use case for it, but it wouldn't be feasible for most.
17:42:00 <TheJollyRoger> Well if you're turning over SIM cards, you might as well turn over your cellphone while you're at it.
17:42:25 <TheJollyRoger> I'm being somewhat facetious here, since humour doesn't translate to text.
17:42:54 <joltman[m]> I suppose if you're a multi-billion dollar drug empire, then the $700 hit and the hassle might be worth it.
17:43:30 <joltman[m]> Assuming you're the kingpin :)
17:43:46 <snowlynx[m]> True why change sim if the imei stays the same. Never thought about that
17:45:17 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Does GrapheneOS support WPA3 mobile hotspot?
17:46:48 <joltman[m]> I use mobile hotspot, but not sure if it's WPA3.
17:49:05 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> 🎧
17:49:33 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> 🎧
17:49:34 <TheJollyRoger> WPA-3 personal is supported on GrapheneOS.
17:50:02 <jj1013[m]> ... looks like Matrix and Telegram desynced again?
17:50:20 <jj1013[m]> It could be a problem on my end, nevermind.
17:51:01 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: I can not see your most recent message on the Matrix side.
17:51:59 <TheJollyRoger> Argh not again...
17:53:16 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Exiting and joining does not seem to be useful.
17:54:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it's likely a problem with the bridge. Need to step away from my desk for a moment, hopefully it'll sort itself out soon.
17:54:36 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> TheJollyRoger: Well, it did not last time.
17:56:21 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> joltman[m]: This guy seems to be on Matrix, but I can not see his message on the Matrix side.
17:56:44 <GrapheneOS-Teleg> <g​ochoingles> Bridges are annoying.
18:07:04 <danascape[m]> As I said source patches will be minimal, but need to track a lot repos
18:07:04 <danascape[m]> https://github.com/grapheneOS-extended
18:07:29 <danascape[m]> daily drivable
18:10:24 <jj1013[m]> Huh. Apparently there is a delay on the bridge.
18:10:24 <jj1013[m]> Really bad delay.
18:15:59 <braxtono[m]> Searx ?
18:17:58 <bizanon[m]> It seems I'm not getting notifications on element. I only get msg pings after I open the app
18:18:25 <bizanon[m]> I have notifications all enabled
18:18:33 <bizanon[m]> Anyone else having similar issues?
18:26:07 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: Where did you install the app from?
18:27:12 <bizanon[m]> I don't remember
18:30:13 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: Long press the icon. App info > (Advanced) > App details

18:34:32 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: Outdated and installed directly as apk, I guess
18:37:00 <luigi> hello, using the Web installer on Pixel4a I am meeting an error at the flashing.
18:37:00 <luigi> Is
18:37:01 <luigi>  Error: Timeout of 10000 ms exceeded
18:37:20 <bizanon[m]> nscnt: what's the best way to install? Thru aurora?
18:37:58 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: At least the release on Google Play expects Play services. I don't know about the APK (from GitHub?). The release on F-Droid works without Play services. Install it from F-Droid to keep it updated and have working push notifications
18:38:12 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: Not Aurora Store. It won't work
18:38:38 <bizanon[m]> Ok thanks
18:39:11 <nscnt[m]> bizanon: For similar upcoming questions there is #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
18:45:01 <luigi> is there a place whre I can find possible solutions ?
18:47:10 <nscnt[m]> luigi: It might be worth trying a different cable/USB port
19:11:55 <zdzihpqbyligtkmh> Could anybody explain in laymen terms how to connect a mobile device with grapheneos to an external screen? Can't seem to figure it out
19:14:36 <nscnt[m]> zdzihpqbyligtkmhxm: You can't
19:15:17 <zdzihpqbyligtkmh> <nscnt[m] "zdzihpqbyligtkmhxm: You can't"> That makes sense. Thank you for replying.
19:16:12 <nscnt[m]> zdzihpqbyligtkmhxm: No problem. It's currently not supported
19:30:41 <grapheneos_user_> 83e73daf-b5ee-476b-835e-91ca8abd3e81: interesting name
19:30:56 <grapheneos_user_> Do you copy paste it or remember it?
19:31:16 <grapheneos_user_> * When you sign in, do you copy paste it or remember it?
19:31:36 <M83e73daf-b5ee-4> Copy-paste
19:31:44 <grapheneos_user_> Makes sense
19:31:50 <M83e73daf-b5ee-4> Maybe I should memorize it though, good memory exercise
19:31:59 <grapheneos_user_> Would be fun
19:32:12 <grapheneos_user_> Preparation for when ipv6 becomes mainstream
19:33:56 <M83e73daf-b5ee-4> I mainly joined to ask about the Web-based GrapheneOS installation instructions. My daily driver is Ubuntu, but I don't really understand which browser I can use for the web-based installation. Could I use a Chromium-based one like Brave or Vivaldi?
19:35:35 <lain[m]1> yes it should work, cause it have WebUSB
19:35:42 <grapheneos_user_> <M83e73daf-b5ee-4 "I mainly joined to ask about the"> Yes, only chromium has decent webusb support
19:36:17 <M83e73daf-b5ee-4> I only ask because the instructions say "Chromium (outside Ubuntu, since they ship a broken Snap package without working WebUSB)"
19:36:39 <M83e73daf-b5ee-4> But you're saying that theoretically shouldn't affect other Chromium-based browsers?
19:40:01 <grapheneos_user_> <M83e73daf-b5ee-4 "But you're saying that theoretic"> Probably not, no
19:40:28 <grapheneos_user_> As long as they support Ubuntu and webusb you should be fine
19:40:55 <M83e73daf-b5ee-4> Cool, thanks!
20:01:27 <TheJollyRoger> danascape[m]: Way to go!
22:52:22 <metalwind[m]> Does anyone know if I backup my phone with seedvault in Lineage 17.1 if I can restore that data in Graphene? I can't find any documentation on using seedvault between different roms
23:10:53 <TheJollyRoger> metalwind[m]: Seedvault backups from other operating systems are compatible with GrapheneOS.
23:11:07 <TheJollyRoger> So, you should be good!
23:12:15 <metalwind[m]> Awesome thank you!
