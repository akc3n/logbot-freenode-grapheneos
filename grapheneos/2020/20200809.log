00:42:39 <strcat[m]> if you had issues with apps like Orbot try this release in Beta
01:58:01 <headgas[m]> I think im going to sell my pixel 4 xl if anyone is interested
02:50:28 <MRK[m]> <headgas[m] "I think im going to sell my pixe"> How much?
03:58:07 <kuantem[m]> You know, its kind of complicated not to bring up off-topic discussions in the GrapheneOS room because I feel the answers here as well as the information I read  are more unbias meaningful.
03:58:32 <kuantem[m]>  * You know, its kind of complicated not to bring up off-topic discussions in the GrapheneOS room because I feel the answers here as well as the information I read  are more unbias and meaningful.
04:00:36 <cn3m[m]> Quantum: if it is related to GrapheneOS, GrapheneOS design, or GrapheneOS usability you should ask here ^
04:03:19 <kuantem[m]> > Quantum: if it is related to GrapheneOS, GrapheneOS design, or GrapheneOS usability you should ask here ^
04:03:19 <kuantem[m]> Indeed. I'll be spending time in this room for sure. Over 20 years in IT, I've only given money to open source projects, never my time. I think this may change with GrapheneOS. This project has truly captured my attention this past month.
04:05:25 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yhmjmFFChcTRjmlHHyvAhymQ >
04:05:38 <cn3m[m]> Love the work everyone is doing
04:07:35 <kuantem[m]> Question: Why is it that LineageOS doesn't support locking of the bootloader? Is this a complicated task from a development end? I've used LineageOS for years before really taking a look at GrapheneOS recently.
04:09:05 <kuantem[m]> It's also one of the reasons I switched to GrapheneOS, the fact that I could unlock/lock my device after installing the OS.
04:12:34 <analtenderloin[m> <kuantem[m] "Question: Why is it that Lineage"> The way I understand it: lineage supports a LOT of devices all with different bootloaders.  GrapheneOS only supports a specific phone model that happens to support non-stock bootloader locking
04:12:53 <analtenderloin[m> Probably wrong tho so wait for someone else to clarify
04:13:27 <kuantem[m]> I see. That could make sense. Using a limited number of certain devices could make development a bit less complicated.
04:14:09 <kuantem[m]> I did a bit of reading on the Pixel hardware, it makes more sense to my why GrapheneOS chose to use it.
04:14:31 <kuantem[m]>  * I did a bit of reading on the Pixel hardware, it makes more sense to me why GrapheneOS chose to use it.
04:16:27 <cn3m[m]> If you use verified boot keys it also means you can't root which most Lineage users want. To support it on only a few devices wouldn't make sense
04:20:05 <cn3m[m]> should they? Yes they should
04:20:10 <cn3m[m]> they also should use user builds
04:20:22 <cn3m[m]> they should also have clear update system
04:25:02 <aeonsolution[m]> they also don't have an incentive to change it when they are seeking broad support in general
04:25:27 <aeonsolution[m]> i don't think Lineage is trying to mislead either, its just a project that lets you customize
04:25:48 <aeonsolution[m]> but the userdebug builds thing should be clarified for sure
04:26:09 <cn3m[m]> divestos and others support boot loader locking when available
04:26:35 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice, well thats good that there are projects that support that
04:27:05 <aeonsolution[m]> Quantum: is there something specific you want to help with?
04:28:24 <kuantem[m]> Well, I haven't coded anything in over 15 years aside from a few shell scripts. So I don't think I'll be able to assist much with code. So, what else is needed?
04:29:16 <aeonsolution[m]> device maintainers and testers are sorely needed
04:30:00 <aeonsolution[m]> there isn't much of a need to code to do that, and the steps to build the operating system are laid out completely on the website
04:30:11 <aeonsolution[m]> what kind of pixel do you use
04:30:26 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <cn3m[m] "divestos and others support boot"> The superior LineageOS
04:30:48 <kuantem[m]> > device maintainers and testers are sorely needed
04:30:48 <kuantem[m]> I can do this for sure.
04:30:58 <kuantem[m]> I recently picked up a Pixel 3A XL
04:31:43 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice, are you using the pixel as your main driver?
04:32:28 <kuantem[m]> Yes I am.
04:32:46 <kuantem[m]> Looking to purchase a USB adapter for the Pixel so I can start using GrapheneOS's backup option.
04:33:24 <aeonsolution[m]> well if you are using it as your main driver, just keep it on the Beta Channel if you want to test changes
04:33:43 <aeonsolution[m]> its the least disruptive way to help out
04:33:59 <aeonsolution[m]> just report issues as they come when the devs push changes to the Beta channel
04:35:55 <aeonsolution[m]> imo to be a device maintainer you would need to be able to build the development branch and help with building projects from github that we are trying to test out
04:35:58 <kuantem[m]> Sounds good. I actually just changed the update option on my device to Beta.
04:38:06 <kuantem[m]> I don't take many photos. And I also use OpenCamera.
04:38:26 <kuantem[m]> I can switch over to the built in camera app and see how things go
04:39:20 <kuantem[m]> I only use OpenCamera because it allows me to set the storage location and rename the images prefix and suffix.
04:40:16 <kuantem[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "just report issues as they come "> Beta channel? Is this located in Matrix as well?
04:40:44 <aeonsolution[m]> oh sorry, i meant in the phone, the system updates has two channels
04:40:51 <aeonsolution[m]> stable and beta
04:41:45 <kuantem[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "stable and beta"> Correct
04:42:10 <aeonsolution[m]> any changes that pushed to the beta channel are generally mentioned here
04:42:42 <kuantem[m]> I have a GitHub atom feed for Graphene on my device as well as all alerts in this channel
04:43:02 <aeonsolution[m]> either strcat, renlord, and anupritaisno1 will mention it-probably
04:43:39 <kuantem[m]> I love atom and RSS
04:44:59 <kuantem[m]> How often does GrapheneOS check for updates? I do not see an option for update cycles.
04:47:24 <kuantem[m]> I still use them because I don't like browsing. Don't much like browsers. Dont care for twitter (I use Nitter feeds), dont care for Reddit (I use .rss feeds for the /r I do follow) so.. I create my own feed service using Feeder.
04:47:35 <cn3m[m]> <kuantem[m] "How often does GrapheneOS check "> every 4 hours
04:47:42 <kuantem[m]> <cn3m[m] "every 4 hours"> Got it.
04:48:11 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
04:48:15 <cn3m[m]> this covers it
04:48:41 <kuantem[m]> having a look
04:52:34 <kuantem[m]> Indeed, and I choose which feed I receive alerts on as well asset Feeder to open all links within Vanadium.
04:53:37 <kuantem[m]> All the joys of the receiving data from both the closed and open internet, within the comforts of a simplistic feed reader inside GrapheneOS. ;)
04:53:53 <kuantem[m]>  * Indeed, and I choose which feed I receive alerts on as well as set Feeder to open all links within Vanadium.
04:55:40 <kuantem[m]> "The updater will use incremental (delta) updates to download only changes rather than the whole OS when one is available to go directly from the installed version to the latest version. As long as you have working network connectivity on a regular basis and reboot when asked, you'll almost always be on one of the past couple versions of the OS which will minimize bandwidth usage since incrementals will always be
04:55:40 <kuantem[m]> available."
04:55:40 <kuantem[m]> This is great
04:56:11 <kuantem[m]> The more I look at it, GrapheneOS is what I was looking for, not LineageOS.
04:58:27 <kuantem[m]> ota_update-2020.08.03.22.zip - When, if ever, is this image necessary to use?
04:59:45 <strcat[m]> explained in the usage guide
05:00:07 <kuantem[m]> I'll read through the site again before asking any more question lol ;)
05:10:45 <kuantem[m]> True. At the time I was using LineageOS, I was parting from Google, but not completely.
05:11:36 <kuantem[m]> Since GrapheneOS, I've pretty much moved completely away from it on my daily driver.
05:41:06 <kuantem[m]> Google's veins run so deep into the stock Android implementation. I'm truly amazed that GrapheneOS is able to operate at the capacity which it does.
05:41:50 <cn3m[m]> <kuantem[m] "Google's veins run so deep into "> AOSP must stay relevant enough for other OEMs
05:42:11 <kuantem[m]> Indeed
05:42:40 <cn3m[m]> Google will never make it unusable is my guess
05:43:38 <kuantem[m]> Agreed, that would change the landscape quite a bit. Many vendors would be unhappy I suspect.
05:57:40 <za_warudo-vilfp8> At least we have that guarantee
05:58:01 <za_warudo-vilfp8> AOSP sample apps though is unmaintained
06:05:55 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Is there some CTS reason, for instance, an app cant be easily replaced like gallery?
06:08:50 <cn3m[m]> check the logs ^
06:13:49 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Oh I forgot, will check it out if something comes up

07:06:59 <kuantem[m]> Not sure, but I would try to stay with the more current hardware, as I'm sure support for older devices may eventually fade due to end if life. Don't know when and how that will be, but its something to keep in mind.
07:25:45 <kuantem[m]> <nsane[m] "I will switch to pixel4 since i "> From what I have read, GrapheneOS is the same across all pixel devices... Don't quote me on that ;)

09:36:26 <dazinism> @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io: think all the AOSP apps like gallery provide services which other apps can use. The CTS tests these services are available. A replacement would have to make the same services available
09:37:26 <dazinism> Think the only way to find out is through making a build without the app
09:38:22 <dazinism> Guess may get lucky with some internet searches and find details, but think its unlikely.
09:39:08 <dazinism> Make a build of GrapheneOS without the app and run it through CTS

21:24:06 <analtenderloin[m> But beware the apps on the actual store
21:24:55 <analtenderloin[m> A good rule of thumb to reduce the chance of malware is to see if the app has the same signature as the play store one.
21:25:12 <analtenderloin[m> I believe this is marked by a green arrow on the app
21:25:54 <nikitalita[m]> I'm not so certain of that any more
21:27:15 <nikitalita[m]> I have found binary differences in apps that I've downloaded from places like apkmirror and the official play store
21:27:36 <analtenderloin[m> <nikitalita[m] "I really only recommend aurora f"> Until it stops working permanently because of something on googles side which is inevitable
21:27:41 <nikitalita[m]> Same version, same platform, signature checks out
21:28:19 <analtenderloin[m> <nikitalita[m] "Same version, same platform, sig"> Yeah it definitely is still risky but its better than blindly downloading any app on the store
21:28:51 <nikitalita[m]> I dunno, it may be perfectly harmless and the differences may be something about the apk structure that is able to be customized without being signed
21:29:06 <analtenderloin[m> Apkmirror has like 10 apps
21:29:18 <analtenderloin[m> What do you guys think about Apkpure?
21:29:22 <nikitalita[m]> But I would rather not trust any unofficial sources
21:29:45 <analtenderloin[m> <nikitalita[m] "But I would rather not trust any"> I am in agreement.  But I think we all realise aurora is temporary
21:31:06 <nikitalita[m]> Perhaps; its an arms race. Google doesn't seem to care right now, but if android spinoffs like calyxOS and grapheneOS gain in popularity, they may put a stop to it
21:31:49 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <analtenderloin[m "I am in agreement.  But I think "> Yeah, Aurora Store might not last very long. I really hope all libre Android software will switch to F-Droid after that happens
21:32:11 <analtenderloin[m> <nikitalita[m] "Perhaps; its an arms race. Googl"> Curious, where will you get your apps from if aurora isn't around?
21:33:21 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <analtenderloin[m "Curious, where will you get your"> F-Droid would be the only answer, I guess
21:33:24 <analtenderloin[m> * where will you get your apps from if aurora isn't around?  What would be the 2nd best
21:33:47 <BlackWinnerYoshi> And the 2nd best would probably be APKMirror
21:34:09 <analtenderloin[m> Has anyone tried apkpure
21:34:26 <nikitalita[m]> Yes
21:34:31 <nikitalita[m]> Same problem as apkmirror
21:34:39 <nikitalita[m]> Anyone can upload apks
21:34:51 <nikitalita[m]> They do check signatures
21:35:05 <nikitalita[m]> But again, that problem I mentioned above
21:35:08 <nikitalita[m]> No
21:35:14 <nikitalita[m]> None of them do
21:37:35 <analtenderloin[m> Yeah aptoide checks signatures but will still publish regardless lol
21:38:02 * analtenderloin[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/yGcSvPfHosSVFAKUnguyoOuA >
21:38:10 <nikitalita[m]> Because they upload pirated apps which necessarily have to be modified and unsigned
21:40:30 <analtenderloin[m> Yep.  That's the bread n butter of aptoide
21:40:42 <analtenderloin[m> Any things better than the spyware ac market tho
21:41:40 <analtenderloin[m> *sees "modify system settings" and "ask to be a device admin" and immediately ignores it"
21:41:46 <analtenderloin[m> * *sees "modify system settings" and "ask to be a device admin" and immediately ignores it*
21:42:25 <cn3m[m]> apkmirror I trust
21:42:29 <cn3m[m]> ApkPure not yet
21:42:45 <cn3m[m]> aptiode never
21:43:20 <analtenderloin[m> <cn3m[m] "ApkPure not yet"> Doesn't APKpure use the same methods to vet apps that apkmirror does
21:43:48 <analtenderloin[m> Mobilism is a meme
21:43:52 <cn3m[m]> I guess I haven't checked any apps though
21:45:12 <nikitalita[m]> Again, your safest bet is using something like gplaycli or aurora; those methods may be blocked in the future, but its the safest way we have right now outside of the play store
21:46:09 <cn3m[m]> or use Stanley and ExodusPrivacy to check with ApkMirror
22:23:03 <nikitalita[m]> djee737ejdd: its not so much installing the apks themselves as getting them directly from the store without using play store
22:23:49 <nikitalita[m]> You can use google play on jailbroken phones; but it still requires the use of play services and a google account
22:25:06 <nickcalyx[m]> Aurora store is forked from an earlier version of the same idea, Yalp Store (play backwards) ... and between them they have existed for several years already.  I would think if google wanted to block them, they would have by now
22:25:36 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm not saying you can count on Google never blocking Aurora, but at the same time it seems well within their power and they seem to be looking the other way
22:25:41 <nikitalita[m]> yeah; it's still a possibility in the future though
22:25:54 <nikitalita[m]> they generally don't seem to care right now, but we'll see
22:26:14 <nikitalita[m]> they probably won't do something blatant right now with all the anti-trust investigations hanging over them
22:26:25 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm sure there have been hundreds of thousands of downloads via aurora and yalp
22:27:14 <analtenderloin[m> <djee737ejdd[m] "There is really no easy way to b"> They just outright start limiting tokens per account
22:27:41 <nikitalita[m]> its very easy to create throwaway google accounts
22:31:49 <nickcalyx[m]> aurora uses maybe 50 or more fake accounts to do the anonymous thing.. and they have obvious names like aurorafake31 aurorafake32 aurorafake33 or something.. they are not even trying to be subtle
22:32:46 <nikitalita[m]> yeah; again, google doesn't really care right at the moment
22:32:53 <nikitalita[m]> they just want people to sign up for google
22:33:27 <nikitalita[m]> that's why they make it very easy to sign up on a new android phone without other verification methods
23:14:13 <kuantem[m]> Morning all
