00:25:22 <shortcastle[m]> <cn3m[m] "light theme it's very nice"> wow nice client
00:25:25 <shortcastle[m]> thank you
00:31:53 <shortcastle[m]> only thing i cant seem to make the fonts bigger
01:31:40 <renlord> problem with microkernel models is that the kernel itself has given up on so much responsibility, there arent really secure implementations of substitute services that replace the existing linux services
01:31:51 <renlord> running in userspace
01:56:43 <TheJollyRoger> Well, crud.
01:58:21 <madaidan[m]> Better having insecure stuff in user space than insecure stuff in the kernel
02:12:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ach. Yeah...

04:00:09 <analog[m]> strcat Happy birthday. (Posted on May 25th 12:00 AM in Toronto)
04:02:02 <analog[m]> 🥳
04:34:23 <headgas[m]> Happy bday!
04:34:50 <headgas[m]> Not the 25th yet here in cali yet though
04:35:31 <analog[m]> Everyone, let's give Daniel Micay a nice happy birthday.
04:35:55 <headgas[m]> For a bday present everyone should get GrapheneOS working on the Pixel 4 for him lol
04:36:07 <zaxxa[m]> Happy birthday Daniel, all the best
04:37:39 <cn3m[m]> Happy Birthday, hope you have a great one
04:43:29 <yavgck[m]> Happy Birthday Daniel. Thank you for all your hard work.
05:33:15 <renlord> strcat[m]: https://sel4.systems/About/seL4-whitepaper.pdf -- have you seen this?
05:42:37 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], yes: adding the channel as #grapheneos%chat.freenode.net⊙ijo
05:42:53 <cg_droid> Happy Birthday Daniel!
05:45:21 <cg_droid> I haven't received the update yet, I'm new in GOS and I don't know if it's all ok or not. Did you receive it?
05:46:06 <cn3m[m]> beta channel tester, I haven't gotten it
05:46:57 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], thanks. I have it in stable as default, isi it ok?
05:47:09 <JTL> Happy birthday strcat. Thanks for what you do!
05:48:38 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "cn3m, thanks. I have it in stabl"> stable is fine
05:48:38 <cn3m[m]> don't worry
05:48:48 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], ok 🙂
05:50:35 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_cg_droid:matrix.org deltas take fucking forever
05:51:19 <cg_droid> lol
05:53:47 <TheJollyRoger> Happy birthday, strcat. I hope all the best for you!
05:53:55 <renlord> i got the update this morning
05:54:13 <renlord> even rebooted while i was asleep lol
05:55:16 <JTL> heh nice
05:56:31 <cg_droid> renlord, lucky you :p
05:58:28 <cn3m[m]> there's dozens of us Graphites
07:04:12 <zoraver[m]> Happy birthday, Daniel!
07:20:10 <blacklight447[m]> <renlord "problem with microkernel models "> What do you think about unikernels
07:20:11 <blacklight447[m]> So basically, a normal kernel, but everything thats not strictly neccesary for its purpose is stripped ouy
07:29:43 <renlord> i havent read much about unikernels, so I dont know. I doubt anything else out there beats seL4 when it comes to real security.
07:30:56 <renlord> but to build a secure OS on top of seL4 with the same quality, people also need to formally verify the user-level services.
07:40:36 <mrxx_0[m]> Happy Birthday Daniel, thank you for this amazing project
08:02:34 <cn3m[m]> <strangefinder[m] "hi, so empty ...?">  hello
08:02:35 <cn3m[m]> the room doesn't show chats for new users
08:02:47 <cn3m[m]> check the logs in the description
08:11:05 <cn3m[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
08:12:33 <mxnorvak[m]> Happy Birthday Strcat, thanks for all the work you do!
08:37:11 <nuttso[m]> Happy Birthday strcat
08:47:47 <Nikos[m]> Happy Birthday strcat !
09:27:28 <cg_droid> Those who has already received the update, how about the new private WebRTC IP handling policy?, have you tested in browserleaks.com for example?
09:30:45 <cn3m[m]> I didn't know Vanadium leaked ip. I heard it didn't and didn't bother to check whoops
09:30:47 <cn3m[m]> not that it matters to me
09:31:15 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], well, it's only the local ip if you use a VPN, not your "real" ip
09:31:36 <cg_droid> With Bromite webrtc is disabled
09:32:31 <cg_droid> Maybe Private Browser will show your real IP if you use javascript
09:32:37 <cg_droid> IDN
09:32:51 <cn3m[m]> oh thanks
09:32:54 <eligiblecoffee[m> Can something be done to the time zone? Websites can access the time zone of the device.
09:33:57 <cn3m[m]> > <@strangefinder:matrix.org> cn3m:Happy Birthday strcat !   whoever u r.
09:33:57 <cn3m[m]> > so how can i get the complete chat, or is this just it, what i see  ....
09:33:57 <cn3m[m]> check the description for the group or use the link I already sent you
09:34:09 <cn3m[m]> <eligiblecoffee[m "Can something be done to the tim"> there's much bigger concerns than that
09:34:51 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], I'd like to know if now it's disabled or protected with Vanadium, although it's only the local IP, not very important
09:34:56 <cn3m[m]> if you need some solid privacy use Tor Browser on a secure(GrapheneOS) in another profile. Don't use Tor on less secure systems
09:35:29 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], yes, that's what I do 🙂
09:35:46 <eligiblecoffee[m> cn3m: thanks
09:37:12 <cn3m[m]> Tor Browser is extremely insecure especially on Android
09:37:13 <cn3m[m]> using a different profile and wiping app data every session is the best way too use it
09:37:24 <cn3m[m]> make sure all profiles are secured with a solid password
09:41:45 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], I also disable almost all apps in that profile when I only use Tor browser
09:42:45 <cn3m[m]>  @strangefinder:matrix.org click at the top where it says GrapheneOS
09:42:47 <cn3m[m]> it will show the room description
09:43:55 <cn3m[m]> > <@freenode_cg_droid:matrix.org> cn3m, I also disable almost all apps in that profile when I only use Tor browser
09:43:55 <cn3m[m]> that's probably pretty wise the stock GrapheneOS profile is pretty hardened, but you never know
09:43:56 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "cn3m, I also disable almost all "> that's probably pretty wise the stock GrapheneOS profile is pretty hardened, but you never know
09:44:32 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], yes... that's the point 🙂
09:45:22 <hypokeimenon[m]> Is it possible to run Graphene OS on an Android emulator
09:45:32 <cn3m[m]> Tor on Android should expect to be exploited
09:45:46 <cn3m[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Is it possible to run Graphene O"> read the site
09:45:52 <cn3m[m]> instructions are there
09:46:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> thanks
09:47:15 <cn3m[m]> build guild anytime @hypokeimenon:tchncs.de
09:47:35 <cn3m[m]> the website is excellent and everyone should read it in its entirety
09:47:49 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], do you disable some sensors in apps by default or only in the new apps like browser, etc?
09:48:39 <cg_droid> I think that nothing happens when I disable almost all sensors but I'm not sure
09:48:48 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "cn3m, do you disable some sensor"> for ipc hijack to gyrophone I run everything
09:48:59 <cg_droid> I tried allowing camera, telephone and others only
09:49:01 <cn3m[m]> sensors matter
09:49:36 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], so, is it to leave them as they are when we install GOS?, only disabling it in the new apps installed?
09:49:44 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], so, is it better to leave them as they are when we install GOS?, only disabling it in the new apps installed?
09:49:54 <cn3m[m]> more off the better
09:50:26 <cg_droid> How many do you allow?, is it possible to disable all apps without finding problems?
09:50:34 <cg_droid> How many do you allow?, is it possible to disable it in all apps without finding problems?
09:50:37 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_cg_droid:matrix.org the more apps you disable them on the better
09:50:54 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "How many do you allow?, is it po"> very few apps truly need it
09:51:10 <cg_droid> For example?: camera, telephone?...
09:51:26 <xabierd[m]> I just installed and set up graphene OS on my phone. So fast and hasle free process. Really well done. Congrats team!
09:51:56 <cg_droid> Gesturarl navigation Bar, GOs launcher...?
09:53:35 <cg_droid> I don't really know which apps really need it
09:55:03 <cn3m[m]> I just meant sensors
09:56:03 <cg_droid> Yes, only sensors
09:56:18 <cg_droid> The new permission with Network
09:56:34 <cg_droid> Not body sensors
09:56:47 <cg_droid> By default there are 100 apps with this permission
09:56:49 <cg_droid> Or more
09:56:59 <cg_droid> I know it's not good in browsers
09:57:07 <cg_droid> But in other apps IDN

10:21:18 <mynick1> i have only f droid, and bromite, i update manually
10:21:54 <cg_droid> Bromite has a repository in F-droid
10:22:08 <mynick1> you have to add it
10:22:11 <mynick1> i think
10:22:25 <cg_droid> https://www.bromite.org/news/2018-12-21-new-fdroid-repository-url

10:36:59 <cg_droid> Bye mynick1
10:37:05 <mynick1> why?
10:37:19 <mynick1> not secure?
10:37:46 <mynick1> can u elaborate a bit
10:37:59 <mynick1> i don't use windows 10
10:38:42 <mynick1> i tryed but i dont feel good even if work well
10:39:46 <mynick1> i left the chat open while im not her, if you can explain why not secure i'll read when back

13:41:53 <TheJollyRoger> I'd recommend against it. If any of these third party launchers require privilege or contravene the Android security model, they probably won't run either.

14:43:10 <kernelpaniker[m]> Is the new 23 may update meant for the beta channel?
14:47:41 <cx2[m]> CalyxOS is another great OS and project. From one of the devs, “CalyxOS is more privacy and usability focused, whereas GrapheneOS is more security focused.
14:48:15 <parazen616[m]> <analog[m] "CalyxOS is AOSP + a few apps pre"> Then I don't get why calyxos exists since it supports the same devices like GOS... And their website looks a bit fishy tbh^^
14:49:35 <analog[m]> parazen616 Their website isn't fishy, just isn't nicely designed.
14:50:28 <dazinism> kernelpaniker: think the way it goes is theres a new release tagged on github, then it goes out as beta update, then after a bit goes out as a standard update

14:51:36 <dazinism> Guess the time scale of each of these steps depends on how much time Daniel has to organise each bit. Also if theres problems with beta...
14:53:12 <cx2[m]> <dazinism "Guess the time scale of each of "> Totally find with problems. All I can really support with at the moment is reporting problems haha... .But I don’t know if I am using the beta release or not. Would I have had to have flashed it originally? Or would if I toggled to the beta channel prior to this most recent update worked?
14:54:55 <kernelpaniker[m]> <dazinism "Guess the time scale of each of "> Thanks, I'm also wondering if there is any statistics on grapheneos usage, like how many people use this os?
14:55:57 <dazinism> cx2: yeah, the toggle put you onto beta
14:58:27 <cx2[m]> dazinism: Awesome. Thanks for the info!
14:58:45 <dazinism> kernelpaniker: theres no way to know how many are using it. I guess the update server gives some impression, but not accurate
14:58:48 <cx2[m]> dazinism: now if i can just figure this damn CTS thing out...

15:04:22 <dazinism> *Compatibility
15:15:17 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to get the cts reports for blueline/grapheneos done in a bit. May take me some time to get them, so I'm starting now.
17:59:31 <williamstopus[m]> what happened with mozilla?
18:08:15 <renor> Just found this, wdyt https://flatkill.org
18:18:54 <madaidan[m]> <renor "Just found this, wdyt https://fl"> Flatpak has utterly broken sandboxing
18:19:46 <williamstopus[m]> madaidan.: where
18:20:40 <madaidan[m]> <williamstopus[m] "madaidan.: where"> The sandbox that flatpaks run under
18:20:45 <cn3m[m]> <analog[m] "CalyxOS is AOSP + a few apps pre"> CalyxOS has microg and signature spoofing
18:21:09 <madaidan[m]> Flatpaks can just choose not to be sandboxed
18:21:40 <williamstopus[m]> <cn3m[m] "CalyxOS has microg and signature"> isnt signature spoofing insecure?
18:21:47 <madaidan[m]> All it takes to escape the sandbox for most apps is `echo exec_malware >> ~/.bashrc`
18:22:04 <analog[m]> <williamstopus[m] "isnt signature spoofing insecure"> Yes.
18:22:19 <madaidan[m]> It's far too permissive even for the apps that choose to be sandboxed
18:23:02 <madaidan[m]> <williamstopus[m] "isnt signature spoofing insecure"> Calyx locks it down so only microG can access it.
18:23:27 <analog[m]> > <@williamstopus:matrix.org> isnt signature spoofing insecure?
18:23:27 <analog[m]>  * Generally yes.
18:30:33 <williamstopus[m]> <ciscnv[m] "Ah, Firefox does the trick. I wi"> firefox is poo
18:35:42 <madaidan[m]> <williamstopus[m] "firefox is poo"> Informative analysis
18:38:54 <blacklight447[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'd recommend against it. If any"> launchers work
18:46:28 <Nikos[m]> > Flatpaks can just choose not to be sandboxed
18:46:29 <Nikos[m]> And a likely reason for this choice is that doing so is the fastest way to get the app running. Unlike Google, distros using flatpak don't have the power to force app developers to rewrite their apps to comply with better security standards. I understand that in the end its the result that matters but I think its unfair to pin the fault of this solely on flatpak devs.
18:48:54 <EssentialChaos[m> > And a likely reason for this choice is that doing so is the fastest way to get the app running
18:48:54 <EssentialChaos[m> Not mitigating spectre is faster too
18:50:05 <EssentialChaos[m> > Unlike Google, distros using flatpak don't have the power to force app developers to rewrite their apps to comply with better security standards
18:50:05 <EssentialChaos[m> They don't need to rewrite apps, they need to figure out permissions, that their apps need

18:51:46 <EssentialChaos[m> For flatpak that is
18:52:33 <mezzanine> Hello, can anyone tell me something about Qualcomm process in running services?
18:54:05 <mezzanine> Like what is it for?
19:46:51 <yavgck[m]> <madaidan[m] "Flatpaks can just choose not to "> While it's not an acceptable long-term solution, I want to point out that there's an app called Flatseal which allows you to toggle the permissions of flatpaks regardless of what they say they need.
19:48:30 <cyredanthem[m]> <ciscnv[m] "FairEmail or K-9 Mail?"> yavgck: not going to do shit for hardening how leaky sudo passwords are
19:48:38 <cyredanthem[m]> I meant to quote yavgck
19:50:10 <cyredanthem[m]> You could push Flatpak to users that don't have sudoer rights and then use users to isolate them from the sudoers and other users (your sandboxes in this case)
19:50:22 <dan-v[m]> <bksoux[m] "haha to avoid Google and for sec"> In my experience on a pixel 3, open camera gives pretty poor results in comparison to google camera. For anyone who wants to take advantage of their nice phone camera, running google camera in another profile or in work profile with microg core (no spoofing needed) and network toggled off works fine.
19:51:28 <cyredanthem[m]> That would offer meaningful isolation as flatpak can now install apps without them having root access at install unlike every other repo based install
19:51:34 <cyredanthem[m]> Flatpak is 97% security theater
19:56:07 <yavgck[m]> Also it seems useless on X11 as discussed by madaidan. : https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html
19:57:41 <cyredanthem[m]> yavgck: Wayland right now is one good piece, but that does no good if there's no other security
20:03:03 <cyredanthem[m]> Linux is toast. Especially on Desktop yavgck
20:03:09 <cyredanthem[m]> It's best to use a sane platform like Windows, macOS, or ChromeOS
20:03:18 <cyredanthem[m]> BSD is even worse for the desktop
20:07:42 <cyredanthem[m]> If the best anti exploitation speaks to you Windows is for you. If the best privacy appeals to you macOS can't go wrong. If excellent sandboxing is called for you're not going to beat Chrom-OS
21:06:27 <eligiblecoffee[m> dan-v: you don't need micro g to run gcam.
21:06:27 <eligiblecoffee[m> https://github.com/LumenReaper/Gcam-Services-Provider
21:07:52 <dan-v[m]> eligiblecoffee: that's awesome! I was just thinking of buildingthis myself. Saved me a lot of time
21:11:21 <cdesai> awesome. wonder if this'd work with some other apps too
21:11:53 <dan-v[m]> nice, confirmed working
21:11:57 <cyredanthem[m]> <dan-v[m] "eligiblecoffee: that's awesome! "> cdesai (@freenode_cdesai:matrix.org): usually breaks more apps then it fixes
21:17:26 <dan-v[m]> eligiblecoffee: that also works with google photos if you care about being able to click the little picture in the corner to see photos, without having to go to a different photo app. microg would crash in the background everytime i launched google photos.
21:18:03 <eligiblecoffee[m> dan-v: okay, will check that as well
21:35:39 <fomijafi[m]> > <@eligiblecoffee:matrix.org> dan-v: you don't need micro g to run gcam.
21:35:39 <fomijafi[m]> > https://github.com/LumenReaper/Gcam-Services-Provider
21:35:39 <fomijafi[m]> Is it still considered best practice to put this in a separate user?
21:43:15 <dan-v[m]> fomijafi: really up to you i suppose. if you're using it with a camera app it can be a bit of pain to switch between profiles just to take pictures. using a work profile might be a good in between.
21:47:09 <cdesai> though that then means your photos are stored separately
21:47:22 <cdesai> guess that's true for both options?
21:55:10 <cdesai> strcat[m]: btw one thing I noticed with eSIMs - it relies on scanning a small-ish QR code, and the scanner that pops up has a box but it detects codes outside that box too.
21:56:00 <strcat[m]> cdesai: what needs to be done to support eSIM?
21:56:24 <cdesai> strcat[m]: it needs some sort of play services sadly
21:56:31 <cdesai> but not much, just need to add apk and esim.img

22:03:07 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yeah just checked it works with microg disabled too, sim added, waiting for activation now.
22:07:23 <xabierd[m]> I read somewhere that esim survives factory reset and relocking bootloader
22:08:01 <cdesai> yes, it does.
22:08:03 <xabierd[m]> It might be possible to activate it on other ROM and not use microg on graphene
22:08:13 <cdesai> when you factory reset there's an option to keep it
22:08:46 <cdesai> xabierd[m]: no, the issue is that the EUICC apks crash without play services

23:27:10 <parazen616[m]> When I plug inbmy headphones I get the message audio device is not compatible
23:30:07 <parazen616[m]> Any any solutions on this?
23:33:58 <Olas> Hello?
23:34:17 <cx2[m]> There’s a work around for Bluetooth headphones. But I can’t say that I have dealt with wired headphones.
23:34:29 <cx2[m]> At least not on Graphene
23:42:05 <parazen616[m]> <cx2[m] "There’s a work around for Blueto"> I don't like Bluetooth plugs...
23:58:04 <overheadscallop[> what kind of headphones? the regular 3.5mm ones? what kind of adapter are you using
23:58:26 <overheadscallop[> I think daniel talked about the problem with the analog adapters https://matrix.to/#/!omAJrepvwSfkXJrqbK:matrix.org/$158948255558311kVrmm:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=privacytools.io&via=librem.one
