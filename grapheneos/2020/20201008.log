00:02:53 <alex-resist> madaidan[m] what does "quite expensive" mean? I don't notice any difference in practice
00:06:28 <madaidan[m]> <alex-resist "madaidan. what does "quite expen"> It mainly affects battery life. By default, you're only using a single circuit for all connections. Now, you could be using dozens.
00:07:56 <alex-resist> My battery life is fine, seriously. I haven't noticed any difference. I'm surprised that the single circuit thing is the default, it should be the other way round
00:08:48 <alex-resist> My 3a XL lasts 2-3 days on average, and if I don't do much it goes up to 4-5 days
00:15:48 <alex-resist> Of all things, the GrapheneOS Launcher is the app that uses most of my battery :)
00:17:54 <renlord> how's that even possible?
00:18:31 <alex-resist> I don't know, but it doesn't affect my absolute battery life
00:19:09 <dazinism> You just spend all day launching things?
00:19:10 <alex-resist> It says right now: GrapheneOS Launcher 18%, NewPipe 13%, Tor Browser 11%, Conversations 7%, Tower Jumper 6%, Orbot 2%
00:19:50 <louipc> weird
00:20:25 <alex-resist> Could other people check that on their phones maybe?
00:21:29 <alex-resist> I charged my phone 2 days ago and I have 1 day 7 hours of runtime left, so it's not a problem at all
00:21:49 <alzxjm[m]> GrapheneOS launcher 4% for me.
00:22:07 <alzxjm[m]> Last charged this morning.
00:24:29 <alex-resist> Ok, but how is 4% in relation to other apps?
00:24:43 <louipc> signal is the most for me
00:24:55 <alex-resist> Signal is 1% for me
00:25:38 <alex-resist> Apparently, people are using their phones vastly differently :)
00:26:16 <louipc> yes me and some other people use signal on desktop too, and it syncs between all devices
00:26:41 <alex-resist> My GrapheneOS Launcher has been used 3h 39min, is that normal?
00:26:50 <poisonoushydra> Vanadium = 13% / Messenger Lite = 7% / Subsonic = 4% / FairEmail = 4% / Ambient Display = 2% / Phone = 2% / Newsblur = 2% / GrapheneOS = 1% / OsmAnd~ = 1%.
00:27:47 <poisonoushydra> GrapheneOS Launcher Used for 14 minutes.
00:27:57 <louipc> yea sounds like too much..
00:28:10 <alex-resist> That's odd
00:29:31 <alex-resist> Maybe all my other apps use so little that GrapheneOS Launcher ends up on top
00:29:45 <poisonoushydra> Yeah, but for almost four hours?
00:30:04 <louipc> yea the time is awkward
00:30:06 <alex-resist> Perhaps, I mean I last charged my phone on Monday or Tuesday
00:30:35 <louipc> do you play with the home screen
00:30:43 <louipc> flip back and forth or something lol
00:31:05 <alex-resist> No, I don't do anything like that. I think these relative values are not very helpful
00:31:21 <alex-resist> Unless we have a measurement in mW or so we cannot really tell
00:31:56 <alex-resist> My phone just lasts forever and maybe GrapheneOS ends up being the app that uses most charge
00:31:56 <louipc> oh yes there are fidget spinner apps heheh
00:32:08 <alex-resist> *GrapheneOS Launcher
00:36:33 <alex-resist> Maybe I'm not a typical user, I made a Galaxy S3 run for 28 days once
00:40:06 <louipc> how
00:41:02 <alex-resist> This is seriously OT, let's continue on grapheneos-offtopic?
00:46:31 <louipc> :)
02:27:11 <lev[m]> I've been digging a bit but I can't find a definitive answer: what does "automatic" do specifically, with respect to private DNS?
02:27:26 <lev[m]> presumably "on" just does all lookups via the specified server
02:29:01 <lev[m]> my use case is this: my carrier will not count traffic from certain services/sites against your data allocation, and they use DNS to tell if you are getting data from e.g. youtube, vs some other streaming service which isn't part of their agreement
02:35:44 <lev[m]> nvm, answered my question, for that particular case manually switching is likely the answer ('automatic' functioality would not have solved it)

06:49:10 <Sheru[m]> Patch or no patch
06:50:34 <strcat[m]> Sheru: do you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set
06:50:34 <strcat[m]> it breaks it
06:50:56 <strcat[m]> Sheru: a script the build runs is considered to have failed if it outputs to stderr
06:51:02 <strcat[m]> and it runs some Java-based program
06:51:32 <strcat[m]> and Java is stupid and prints to stderr if you have _JAVA_OPTIONS set which GrapheneOS sets in envsetup.sh to disable writing out perf stats in /tmp
06:53:54 <strcat> strcat[m]: matrix is super broken atm not sure you can see what I wrote
07:03:38 <Sheru[m]> <strcat[m] "Sheru: do you have _JAVA_OPTIONS"> Unsure about it, it breaks at the very start of the build

07:19:21 <Sheru[m]> None that does not break usability
08:10:36 <strcat[m]> pluja: this is a general thing and not really something specific to Network but apps are expected to handle standard permissions better
08:10:46 <strcat[m]>  * pluja: this is a general thing and not really something specific to Network but apps are expected to handle standard 'dangerous' permissions better
08:11:20 <strcat[m]> since we change internet access from being considered 'normal' to 'dangerous', it is not something apps tend to take seriously, since it isn't by the regular platform
08:11:21 <strcat[m]> that's the issue
08:11:56 <strcat[m]> pluja: we can change Vanadium to prompt when an app without INTERNET tries to open a URL
08:12:14 <strcat[m]> that's the extent of what we can do (the rest of the OS already handles this properly - things like DownloadManager check for the perm)
08:21:12 <pluja[m]> Ok, I see. How can one know if a particular app is handling this properly?
10:03:52 <Sheru[m]> Rarely an app that requires network permission on its own to send URL to browser, and even that is accidental design
10:09:33 <alzxjm[m]> <strcat[m] "that's the extent of what we can"> Download Manager checks the requesting app for Network permission?
10:09:40 <strcat[m]> yes
10:09:42 <strcat[m]> as do other OS components
10:09:51 <strcat[m]> that's standard in AOSP for the INTERNET permission
10:10:04 <strcat[m]> it's third party stuff (Chromium in this case counts as 'third party') that doesn't
10:10:19 <alzxjm[m]> I see
10:10:33 <Sheru[m]> Can't find the _JAVA_OPTIONS
10:10:37 <strcat[m]> the WebView supports it properly (it's a library so it's not really up to it though)
10:10:43 <strcat[m]> Sheru: well what error do you get
10:11:10 <strcat[m]> I'm pretty tired so I probably can't help debug it right now
10:11:47 <Sheru[m]> It's quite long, gotta save it on text file first

10:16:11 <Sheru[m]> <strcat[m] "I'm pretty tired so I probably c"> It's cool
10:17:03 <strcat[m]> Sheru: issues seems to be that the Chromium clang toolchain is linked against an old ncurses
10:17:08 <strcat[m]> you need the old ncurses library
10:18:27 <strcat[m]> Sheru: Chromium and AOSP have their own toolchains for reproducible builds and because they're at a scale where if you tried to use anything not regularly tested it'd uncover too many issues (Linux kernel is similar - new major compiler versions inevitably uncover bugs / cause problems)
10:19:04 <strcat[m]> AOSP has a more self-contained system using a container with nsjail though
10:19:17 <strcat[m]> still depends on some system libraries and a few commands but far less than before
10:19:44 <strcat[m]> becoming more and more self-contained and less likely to break due to incompatibilities with the OS though
10:19:56 <strcat[m]> fewer potential reproducible build issues, etc. too
10:20:04 <strcat[m]> you can do reproducible builds of the prebuilts too
10:26:17 <Sheru[m]> Thanks for the input
10:27:45 <Sheru[m]> Is Arch Linux more recommended for building environment?
10:32:13 <Sheru[m]> It was quite a novice mistake on my side not checking the packages involved
10:54:49 <strcat[m]> Sheru: you'll have that issue on any modern distribution until you install the old ncurses library
10:55:04 <strcat[m]> they build the toolchain on some ancient distribution to make it compatible across more
10:56:57 <creigh[m]> Anyone ever tried: https://github.com/crosstool-ng/crosstool-ng
11:14:41 <strcat[m]> LLVM-based toolchains can target any of their supported architectures with the same set of tools
11:15:01 <strcat[m]> there aren't separate builds of the toolchain for each target like GNU tools
11:16:18 <strcat[m]> just one clang and the other tools vs. separate GCC for each OS + architecture + ABI combination
14:40:21 <burningdaemon[m]> How do you check if the verified boot was successful?
14:53:43 <kopolee11[m]> The Auditor app should let you know. https://attestation.app/tutorial
15:44:43 <systemctl[m]> What's the deal with apps that warn about not working without Google play services, that seemingly seem to work flawlessly without them?
15:45:31 <p00l00p[m]> because most of apps uses google push for notifications
15:45:57 <p00l00p[m]> they are refering to notifications when they talk about "not working w/o g.play"
15:46:06 <p00l00p[m]>  * they are refering to notifications when they talk about "not working w/o g_play"
15:46:24 <systemctl[m]> Yeah, sure. But these apps specifically say they don't work without Google services (not all apps do) yet they work fine.
15:47:51 <systemctl[m]> "<appname> won't run without Google play services" yet they do and work seemingly fine.
15:49:36 <p00l00p[m]> well that's how it's made
15:50:50 <BalooRJ> Some use maps from Google Play Service as well, like Zipcar
15:59:24 <poisonoushydra> A lot of them will still work but use consume slightly more battery because they need to be exempt from Battery Optimization in order to push notifications to your device. Many of these will simply use a persistent notification to achieve this.
17:01:20 <madaidan[m]> <burningdaemon[m] "How do you check if the verified"> If it wasn't, your device wouldn't boot.
