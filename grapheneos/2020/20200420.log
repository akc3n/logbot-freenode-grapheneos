00:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hey er... hey strcat, no rush but when you've got the cts archive file, could you just let me know, please? I don't want to leave the VPS on for too long while it's not being used.
00:20:42 <dazinism> TheJollyRoger: your fdroid explanation sounded reasonable. One thing is that Googles been pushing app devs to let Play sign apps..
00:20:53 <dazinism> https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423?hl=en
00:21:26 <Cruft> ugh
00:21:43 <TheJollyRoger> dazinism: thanks, I'm trying to be fairer to it X(
00:21:43 <Cruft> I wonder what that will do for liability
00:22:12 <dazinism> Cant remember who was asking about reproducable apps on fdroid
00:22:16 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, I've noticed that Google has been really pushing their own "sign on behalf of" system. I don't like that idea at all, but I like that the developers have the choice to pin and sign their own apps.
00:22:19 <dazinism> Currently that can only be done with v1 signing keys
00:22:22 <TheJollyRoger> *sign and pin their own apps.
00:23:03 <dazinism> But they are just about to change that to also be possible with v2 and v3 keys (I think)
00:23:09 <Cruft> I mean, I would want to stay as far away from becoming a digital notary as possible but, Google.
00:23:23 <Cruft> Someone is going to sue them over the result of that.
00:24:12 <TheJollyRoger> Cruft: if you've already installed say, Signal, since it's been signed by Moxie's keys, Google would gain nothing by trying to push counterfeit updates for it, since that certificate is already pinned for Signal and won't change.
00:24:38 <Cruft> I'm saying it could be looked at as an endorsement of safety
00:24:41 <TheJollyRoger> It offers the app developers /the choice/.
00:25:02 <dazinism> Dont think there are currently many apps at all on fdroid.org that are  reproducable builds with the devs sig
00:25:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, there really aren't. Even if they become reproducible at a future date, they can't be installed because that certificate can't change.
00:25:40 <dazinism> Other thing I was wondering about AGE
00:26:13 <TheJollyRoger> This is highly desirable though, I'd rather have a trust-on-first use mandatory access control than leave this open to user judgement.
00:27:09 <Cruft> inb4 hourly cert updates
00:28:54 <TheJollyRoger> Cruft: Per-application Certificate Pinning is done on the device and it's a core element of the Android security model. Even if you have play services installed, Play Services on their own can't override this.
00:29:34 <TheJollyRoger> I highly doubt GrapheneOS would ever lose it.
00:30:15 <TheJollyRoger> Plus, the certificate is assumed to be pinned for the lifetime of the app. Updates must match the previous one, which must match the previous one, which must match the previous one, all the way back to when the app was first installed.
00:30:48 <dazinism> Could you maybe use AGE on mobile via AnLinux (Run Linux On Android Without Root Access) - https://f-droid.org/app/exa.lnx.a
00:31:17 <TheJollyRoger> Not sure.
00:34:56 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying to beat it into compiling on ppc64le. So far, not having too much luck.
00:47:27 <Cruft> grapheneos has a hard time with the included usbc to usba adapters
00:51:51 <Cruft> It can't allow the phone to control the device through the stock adapters
01:58:59 <madaidan[m]> Remember that guy that complained on a few million subs about Daniel banning him?

04:03:21 <mxnorvak[m]> hey, a noob question here, is adb pm uninstalling kinda the same as disabling the app in the os itself? and let's say for a xiaomi stock rom, is adb uninstalling all Google and stock apps good enough in terms of degoogling?
04:06:38 <kohntree[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "hey, a noob question here, is ad"> It's good enough. Those apps aren't root. They are privileged. It is removed from the profile. I think this is partially related to verified boot that they are not taken out of the system
04:07:10 <mxnorvak[m]> and do u guys know if xiaomi's stock ROM is any good in terms of privacy and security?
04:07:10 <mxnorvak[m]> sry i know it's really outa question in here cuz it has nothing to do with pixels and GrapheneOS but you guys are trustworthy and knowledgeable and that's really hard to find in other places
04:07:11 <Cruft> Is any space saved from it not duplicating?
04:08:54 <mxnorvak[m]> <Cruft "Is any space saved from it not d"> nope the data is still there, and actually all the apps will come back if you do a factory reset
04:09:42 <mxnorvak[m]> <kohntree[m] "It's good enough. Those apps are"> so verified boot is the reason they won't be completely unistalled then!
04:09:44 <Cruft> I understand. I meant is it duplicated from the backup space to currently running image.
04:10:34 <mxnorvak[m]> <Cruft "I understand. I meant is it dupl"> i dunno
04:11:04 <Cruft> If i can save HALF the space, it would still be worthwhile on fixed storage devices
04:13:10 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: If you have the device in your hand right now, you could try running the CTS to see what the patch levels are at. It's not guaranteed, but it might shed some light.
04:14:35 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: If you have the device"> i do, but rn it has a LOS rom on it, could it still be done? i guess i need to flash the stock rom fist and lock the bootloader and then try it
04:15:51 <kohntree[m]> Wait you can verify patch level?
04:15:52 <TheJollyRoger> You'll probably get different results for each operating system.
04:16:34 <TheJollyRoger> Sort of. You can run the compatibility suite tests to see if your device is vulnerable to certain things, but I'm not sure what exactly it'll test for.
04:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> Since the CTS isn't updated very frequently it's not going to be a good indicator but it might be able to let you know if there are any really glaring red flags.
04:17:48 <rutxonboard[m]> Where does one get this? Is it better than SnoopSnitch?
04:18:21 <TheJollyRoger> https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts
04:18:50 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Sort of. You can run the compati"> I'll make sure to try it and report back the results
04:19:45 <rutxonboard[m]> I saw they mention watches on there
04:19:49 <TheJollyRoger> Don't quote me on this, I only happened to notice it while I was running CTS on my own device for some reasons here. I'm not quite sure what it does fully, but if you're able to find out more, let me know.
04:19:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Aren't Android watches unencrypted?
04:20:34 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know.
04:24:08 <TheJollyRoger> Don't take my word on the CTS for everything, either. Like I said, I'm not sure what it does but it *might* possibly be one place to look into.
08:07:39 <TheJollyRoger> strcat I'm turning off the Integricloud VPS for the night. Will turn it back on tomorrow.
09:01:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Is the Pixel 4(and presumably the 4a) more secure in any meaningful way compared to say a Pixel 3 series?

09:13:17 <some_bloke[m]> Anyone else having troubles with Aurora Store lately? Searches and refreshing the update page just go forever without showing anything.
09:36:58 <dazinism> I'd never looked at aptoide, but my brother stuck it on my nephews nvidia shield android set top box and I found it was connecting to facebook...
09:37:35 <dazinism> That was enough to easily persuade him to take it off
09:37:51 <rutxonboard[m]> Aurora > F-Droid > Amazon App Store > Google Play > everything else
09:37:56 <dazinism> Didnt realise it is a blockchain thing

09:41:37 <rutxonboard[m]> Amazon app store is great since the apps don't need gapps obviously
09:42:35 <dazinism> I've used it a bit over the last few years and found it to can often be very annoying to use....
09:42:43 <some_bloke[m]> Except, it's Amazon. Also a horrible, shit company.
09:43:36 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes it's shit, but good shit compared to alternatives. I have a profile for it
11:13:09 <joeri_poeri[m]> what device do you use strcat
11:13:10 <joeri_poeri[m]> mobile device
11:18:07 <renlord> what does your adapter have anything to do with grapehenos?
11:18:17 <renlord> oh whoops, long time ago.
12:14:24 <Hirppa> I wonder why someone has named Aurora Droid so confusingly similar to Aurora Store.
12:15:36 <Hirppa> Aurora Droid is an alternative GUI to F-Droid compatible repos, whereas Aurora Store is an alternative GUI to Google Play Store.
12:17:49 <Hirppa> People tend to speak of "Aurora" without specifying which one of those they mean.
12:18:56 <dallemon[m]> Hirppa: it's the same person working on both AFAIK

17:03:10 <dazinism> Back when I was checking aptoide out I tried downloading Network Monitor (doesn't work on Q) from them so I could see where their app was connecting.

17:39:28 <dextr[m]> one question I need to ask still is (despite the fact I really don't want to set it up) how to setup my google students calendar as I haven't found any  way to add that account anywhere.. and I need to have this for another half a year :/
17:46:36 <joeri_poeri[m]> I happen to be know how to set up calendars on grapheneos
17:46:40 <joeri_poeri[m]> somewhere on the calendar website will probably be a link that allows you to add the link to other applications
17:46:42 <joeri_poeri[m]> you're looking on the website for either an ical or caldev option. Don't download an ical file and import it on your phone as that's just a list of events currently scheduled, the beauty of an online calendar is that they can update
17:47:41 <dextr[m]> ok I'll search for that - thank you ;)

19:33:19 <cx2[m]> Is usb file transfer disabled in profiles that are not admin?
19:34:04 <cx2[m]> can't seem to get it to work... and i have a wildly shitty connection so moving .apk manually is necessary
20:05:38 <fll[m]> cx2: no such thing as admin profile. Owner profile, yes. But I don't think that USB file transfer is restricted to that. You need to have the phone unlocked to transfer files though
20:09:37 <rutxonboard[m]> Yes, I use it to transfer between profiles
20:34:35 <cx2[m]> Owner profile...well I am able connect via usb in the owner profile just fine.... but the others, using the same cable, etc, they dont' like it for some reason...
20:35:04 <rgeturk[m]> the Settings app labels it as an "Admin" profile
20:44:12 <cx2[m]> yeah I guess that's what got me confused... no matter the case. Trying to get it working
