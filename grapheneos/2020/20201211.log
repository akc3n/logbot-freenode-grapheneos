00:38:50 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Besiiiiiides. I've seen what hap"> Started asking for advice on how to flash GOS but didn't have or know he needed a cord.
00:43:15 * TheJollyRoger chuckles. Oh boy.
01:10:28 <M2liz[m]> pixel 4a release works for 5g too yeah?
01:21:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hi M2liz[m], resoundingly no, the Sunfish release *will not* work for the 4a5G.
01:21:57 <TheJollyRoger> Even though the 4a resembles the 4a5G externally, the two devices are extremely different underneath that glossy black polycarbonate shell.
01:22:17 <TheJollyRoger> They use different kernels, different chips, and different drivers, and most importantly, different bootloaders.
01:22:52 <TheJollyRoger> Although I believe fastboot does have a safety check in place to prevent accidental mis-installation, I would not advise trying to test this.
01:45:26 <M2liz[m]> thanks
01:45:27 <M2liz[m]> sadly i did learn the hard way
01:45:36 <M2liz[m]> paper weight
01:46:22 <TheJollyRoger> Oh shit!
01:46:32 <TheJollyRoger> Oh shit shit man, that really sucks.
01:46:34 <louipc> what about jtag
01:47:09 <M2liz[m]> yeah hard brick wont turn on nothing
01:47:12 <M2liz[m]> ill look into jtag
01:47:37 <louipc> need a person with skillz
01:48:29 <TheJollyRoger> M2liz[m]: yeah makes sense... if the bootloader is messed up, then that phone is hardbricked forever. I don't know if you could do it with the JTAG headers, you would need to remove the phone's screen and you would also need something that can talk directly to the phone's SSD... I don't know what kind of a programmer you would need for that.
01:49:39 <TheJollyRoger> Or what the pinout would be.
01:50:33 <louipc> its already bricked so have fun with it
01:51:26 <TheJollyRoger> Any word on an RMA to Google?
01:51:55 <oldperson_newuse> Hello all.  Got grapheneos installed and it has been rock solid.  Only missing one thing .  When someone leaves a voice mail I do not get a notification.  Specifically in the default dialer there usually is a 4th tab for voicemail.  Does grapheneos support visual voice mail ?  The carrier is verizon USA and the device is crosshatch aka pixel3xl.
01:51:56 <oldperson_newuse> thanks
01:52:55 <M2liz[m]> going through the process now so we'll see
01:53:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hi oldperson_newuse, huh. I haven't had any problems with it, but I think some other people on Verizon have reported a similar problem.
01:53:57 <M2liz[m]> sadly i did try looking it up but all i got was some rando on reddit saying something to the effect of "yeah 5g should work" a few months ago so thats on me
01:54:00 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm not on Verizon, though, so I don't think I'm able to reproduce it.)
01:54:15 <TheJollyRoger> Aw, shoot!
01:54:43 <oldperson_newuse> thanks for the replies. I was thinking this may be relevant but it is over my head https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail
01:55:16 <oldperson_newuse> note that visual voice mail did work with aosp11 and with lineageos_10
01:55:21 <TheJollyRoger> Let me take a look...
01:55:36 <oldperson_newuse> ty
01:56:00 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, I actually haven't seen this before, then again, I haven't studied much in this area yet. (I'm not actually a developer, not yet :P)
01:56:37 <oldperson_newuse> TheJollyRoger yes was on here late at night a couple nights ago and spoke with you about this.  so Maybe I am the 'other people'  :-)
01:56:53 * TheJollyRoger laughs
01:56:58 <TheJollyRoger> Well there's that then, hee hee.
01:57:24 <oldperson_newuse> I flashed from lineageos but I wouldnt think that would matter as the flash should have erased everything.  is that a correct assumption ?
01:58:28 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. When you lock and unlock bootloader state, all userdata is wiped. When you install the new system image, and lock the bootloader, it shouldn't matter; all GrapheneOS system images for a given device are signed, verified, and bitwise identical.
01:59:05 <TheJollyRoger> So this is why we can use auditor to determine the authenticity of the signing keys, which attest to the authenticity of the entire system image.
01:59:29 <TheJollyRoger> (Provided the bootloader is locked! If the bootloader isn't locked then verified boot is disabled.)
02:00:40 <TheJollyRoger> Sec, I'll repost...
02:00:48 <TheJollyRoger> > Yeah. When you lock and unlock bootloader state, all userdata is wiped. When you install the new system image, and lock the bootloader, it shouldn't matter; all GrapheneOS system images for a given device are signed, verified, and bitwise identical.

02:00:55 <oldman_newUser> sorry I got disconnected.  tethering thru phone at work.  using graphene :-)
02:00:57 <TheJollyRoger> > (Provided the bootloader is locked! If the bootloader isn't locked then verified boot is disabled.)
02:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> No problem! There's what you missed earlier.
02:01:09 <oldman_newUser> ty
02:02:47 <oldman_newUser> ok.  I think I will subscribe to the visual voice mail plus from verizon for 30 days and see if it installs the correct bits on my phone.  not ready to give up on this yet.  I know voice mail is old tech but sometimes business and doctors and related people calling just need to leave a message.  I do get a missed call notification but no VM notice
02:03:13 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense in that respect!
02:03:17 <TheJollyRoger> Alrighty, fingers crossed man.
02:03:35 <louipc> huh.. i hope it doesnt install junk
02:04:14 <louipc> voicemail is good but needs to be done better
02:04:20 <oldman_newUser> yea i know.  plus verizon warns ' you are changing your plan'  and I have several discounts for the plan I currently have.
02:04:24 <TheJollyRoger> (If you're curious or want to know more about the process, you can actually try peeling open the factory image .zip file, and you will find a bunch of ext4 sparse images inside. Those are exact copies of the partition, sowhen you install those to your phone, the entire old system partition will be replaced.)
02:07:09 <oldman_newUser> TheJollyRoger  thanks.  I may have to do that.  prolly need to read the doc I posted earlier about VMM and maybe see if that gives me any clues.  I do know LIneageos had some apps called carrier_provisioning_sp?  prolly should look and see if grapheneos has thos along with some sim_manager stuff.
02:08:39 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I unfortunately am out of my depth here, but fingers crossed for you!
02:09:53 <oldman_newUser> yea graphene doesnt show a carrier provisioning app but it does show a sim_toolkit.  but not the same as lineageos.  One of the things I love about graphene is they state to relock the bootloader.  so thanks again and I will check back in later
02:31:24 <BugHunter1000> Can one unroot after installing Graphene to drop back down to "user" privileges?
02:32:08 <TheJollyRoger> BugHunter1000: I don't think rooting, then unrooting is really doable on GrapheneOS, not without an exploit of some sort.
02:32:43 <TheJollyRoger> If you did find an exploit, the phone's verified boot will simply undo any changes you make to the system partition upon next restart.
02:40:22 <Hamilton_Hamster> Hello everyone! Does anyone one know reasonably when to expect pixel 4a5g and pixel 5g support?
02:41:27 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Hamilton_Hamster, at this moment the 4a5G and the 5 is not on the project's roadmap; currently we're looking for another maintainer to help out with that.
02:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> The rule of thumb is that for every new device (or new device family, if it's close enough and uses the same SoC, kernel, and drivers) that is to be supported, the project will need one more maintainer for it dedicated full time.
02:43:34 <Hamilton_Hamster> I see, I am looking around the grapheneos site, and can't find a roadmap. Is there onee hiding out somewhere?
02:44:21 <TheJollyRoger> Don't think there's one made up for it yet, not specifically.
02:45:22 <Hamilton_Hamster> Ok, thank you guys btw! Graphene is such a better os than stock android
02:45:39 <TheJollyRoger> With respect to new devices though, GrapheneOS has a policy of "we do it properly, or not at all" so this is why if the manpower is'nt there to support the new device, it won't be supported.
02:46:05 <Hamilton_Hamster> Thats a good policy
02:46:22 <TheJollyRoger> This is so we don't end up in a situation where we've got a large number of devices and none of them are getting enough attention to not only meet, but also exceed the security and privacy properties of the factory operating system.
02:46:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
02:46:42 <Hamilton_Hamster> I've been using the os for a few months, and its really great thank you guys!
02:47:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hey, glad to hear you're getting good use out of it! If you do find it good, please be sure to donate at https://grapheneos.org/donate - this project's kept funded by donations and that permits the developers to keep going!
02:47:20 <Hamilton_Hamster> A small question, are there any apps you guys recomend that often get overlookd?
02:47:31 * TheJollyRoger starts thinking.
02:48:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm hesitant to recommend other apps, because this is largely going to be a personal choice for everyone who is on GrapheneOS. In the future, we'd like to have a first-party app store, but that's for the future.
02:48:34 <TheJollyRoger> I very much like Signal Private Messenger, and that's a pretty safe bet, a lot of people here run Signal.
02:48:42 <Hamilton_Hamster> yeah im just asking in general, because discovering stuff on foss is difficult
02:48:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:48:58 <Hamilton_Hamster> yeah signal was the first thing I installed
02:50:04 <TheJollyRoger> It's a bit of a sore spot that apps are the difficult part in the FOSS ecosystem. But I can also recommend Super Tux Kart, it's a great game and can really help melt a lot of long hours waiting for the bus away.
02:54:54 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back shortly!
02:56:22 <Hamilton_Hamster> Cool! Ill check it out, thank you!
03:14:40 <thomasJefferson> Hi can somebody do Auditor remote verification with meWe can upload screenshots / to scan QR Codes
03:26:04 <thomasJefferson> Do you guys have a reccomended Antivirus for Graphene OS? Such as ESET Mobile apk?
03:26:19 <thomasJefferson> I just want to scan my GOS filesystem for viruses/
03:26:53 <rny> thomasJefferson: userland applications dont have access to the entire fs
03:27:01 <thomasJefferson> Wonderful
03:27:24 <thomasJefferson> Does Graphene OS have any defence against Maliscious IMSI catcher- over the air updates
03:27:34 <thomasJefferson> IMSI Catchers can push fake system updates which are actually malware onto phones
03:27:52 <thomasJefferson> Does Graphene have any protection against maliscious Over the air updates
03:28:00 <rny> thomasJefferson: grapheneos does ota updates using a pre-installed application that ships with the OS itself.
03:28:05 <thomasJefferson> I think the Encrypted Connection to the update server
03:28:10 <rny> and does not rely on carrier ota updates
03:28:14 <thomasJefferson> Perfect
03:28:27 <thomasJefferson> I think Graphene should increase its security against IMSI catcher MITM-style attacks
03:29:16 <rny> thomasJefferson: this is not a os concern, you should raise this with the LTE working group
03:30:08 <thomasJefferson> Where are they?
03:30:13 <thomasJefferson> You mean the LTE standards body itself
03:30:20 <rny> thomasJefferson: yes ^
03:30:25 <thomasJefferson> I think the Protocol has intentional weaknesses to allow LE interception
03:30:32 <thomasJefferson> similar to NSa bullrun program
03:30:50 <rny> thomasJefferson: conspiracies and speculations are offtopic in this channel
03:31:02 <rny> please take it elsewhere.
03:31:41 <oldman_newuser> hello.  working on building grapheneos for my device.  crosshatch aka pixel3xl.  Notice an abnormality with the docs at https://grapheneos.org/build.  that page states under the kernel section: Pixel 3: crosshatchPixel 3 XL: blueline.  This seems reversed ?  whatdoya think ?
03:32:34 <rny> oldman_newuser: crosshatch/blueline builds the same kerneel
03:32:51 <rny> they share identical SoCs

04:19:52 <TheJollyRoger> Well, looks like someone's not getting their ban lifted.
06:30:59 <CaptainBlackton> Just curious, do the zoom and astro-photo features of the pixel 4 work in Graphene OS by default?
06:56:50 <Lynn[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "Orbot is an option, but some peo"> Malicious Tor nodes should not be able to do anything as long as you're using a strong TLS connection. The main thing malicious Tor nodes will do is attempt to track you, do time correlations, etc.

07:17:48 <oldman_newuser> I could try.  but let me get this first one done to see if I can do it.  I do remember seeing something about a different boot animation as a pull request, but when I booted up i didnt see it
07:18:24 <CaptainBlackton> OK, thanks <Lia[m]> and <r0tt0r[m]>! That's good to know! It's just that I had bought a previous device for LOS, but the camera and light didn't work at all, so I thought I would double-check before trying a new device/OS
07:18:50 <CaptainBlackton> I actually just ordered it, so no turning back now anyway!

07:22:33 <oldman_newuser> I'm compiling to get the source to see why visual voice mail doesnt work on verizon .  I saw this commit https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_services_Telephony/commit/fa6c9d723cb47a540be721aec57b877937302237 . however when I looked at the plain aosp vm3 was not enables and visual voice mail aka vvm , is working.  I am thinking it has
07:22:34 <oldman_newuser> something to do with the carrierconfig.  anyway give me a bit to get more accsustomed to what is going on here.  I really like grapheneos
07:33:23 <clox[m]> Hi guys, is signal still secure. I read a post that it has been decrypted

08:31:03 <somenerd[m]> yes
08:42:15 <Flatline> Quick question about the contact app in graphene if anyone knows the answer. Just tried to add a contact and the app suggested me to "log into my gmail account", what is that about?
08:48:57 <Lia[m]> Can you record and reproduce that occurence?
08:59:19 <emsyna[m]> just press "cancel"
09:09:14 <Flatline> Lia[m] after adding contacts i had the option to click a popup for synchronizing my contacts automatically.
09:11:10 <Flatline> And in the window that came up it says "Synchronize changes not only in Google contacts but in all apps"
09:11:20 <Flatline> not word for word but in the sense
09:11:47 <Flatline> (Translated the gist from german)

09:19:15 <Flatline> this is what it looks like
09:42:58 <arpysco[m]> very strange
09:46:04 <Flatline> it's in german but you get the gist. Maybe a localization leftover?
09:49:32 <arpysco[m]> I don't know
10:01:27 <fll[m]> Flatline: do you have any sync accounts set up at all? Like maybe davx?
10:01:47 <Flatline> Didn't set any accounts up at all
10:02:34 <Flatline> My account section is literally empty
10:03:09 <Flatline> And the default "Account" for the contact list is "Device"
10:06:43 <fll[m]> Hmm...weird that it tells you about syncing even though it's not set up.
10:06:43 <fll[m]> Either way, all those included aosp apps are not really maintained. I would assume that the message is a symptom of that.
10:08:59 <Lia[m]> <Flatline "Lia after adding contacts i had "> Yep, that option is definitely there

16:01:52 <ruddo[m]> 3a battery life > 3.
16:01:52 <ruddo[m]> I expect the same is true for 4a / 4.
16:01:52 <ruddo[m]> It truly is great battery life.
16:34:20 <Thatcher[m]> 4a here, I get around 16 hours SOT with GOS
16:34:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> <fluoridatedsheep "stupid question: does graphene u"> It should use file-based encryption now, which is far more secure as it only decrypts what's in use. The whole kaboodle is encrypted one way or another.
16:34:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> If the phone is off, it's unreadable until it's booted up and the correct passphrase is entered
16:36:37 <fluoridatedsheep> I see, i just wasnt sure if it had any implementation of block-level encryption with that
16:38:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> You'd have to ask strcat
16:38:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't remember
16:39:00 <Golli[m]> Just found a bug:
16:39:00 <Golli[m]> Settings -> Apps and notifications -> SEE ALL * APPS -> Tap the search icon (top right) -> Tap on any app -> Go back -> You're now missing 1/3 of the screen in that menu.
16:39:00 <Golli[m]> 4 XL, latest update.
16:39:12 <sst_76> I occasionally try to connect to my work WiFi. It worked up until a week or so ago - then it refused to do the connectivity check or take me to the sign in page. Brave Browser said it was because the graphene connectivity check webpage was using HSTS. Can't use WiFi. Anybody see anything like that?
16:40:00 <arpysco[m]> I have my connectivity check set to google, no issues here
16:41:14 <sst_76> Didn't see that setting. Will try that later. Thanks.
16:41:30 <strcat[m]> sst_76: I'm not sure what it would have to do with HSTS
16:41:49 <sst_76> Me either. It made no sense.
16:42:04 <strcat[m]> HSTS is not implemented by UrlConnection
16:42:25 <strcat[m]> and we don't change the connectivity check pages that browsers choose to use
16:42:59 <strcat[m]> sst_76: it seems more likely that the network somehow special cases the Google addresses, which you can still use
16:43:05 <strcat[m]> interested to know more but that information you're getting from Brave just seems baseless
16:43:14 <sst_76> So if I attempted to sign in via the browser lite, it would throw a certificate error. Trying to sign in via the browser throws the HSTS error.
16:43:29 <strcat[m]> the connectivity check does
16:43:33 <strcat[m]> HTTPS -> HTTP -> HTTP fallback -> HTTP other fallback
16:43:37 <jpds> sst_76: Are you using a VPN?
16:43:49 <strcat[m]> sst_76: yeah but what does that have to do with HSTS
16:44:08 <strcat[m]> if you're getting a certificate error... that's a problem
16:44:11 <strcat[m]> that means the network is trying to do TLS interception
16:44:15 <strcat[m]> that's not just a captive portal
16:44:20 <strcat[m]> that's an active MITM attack
16:45:55 <sst_76> Heh. This is a govt WiFi so that doesn't surprise me.
16:46:26 <strcat[m]> sst_76: when you say that you tried to sign in via a browser, what do you mean?
16:46:32 <strcat[m]> sst_76: describe exactly what you mean by that
16:46:35 <sst_76> So the sign
16:46:46 <strcat[m]> you opened up the browser, went to example.com, and got an error?
16:46:59 <sst_76> Yeah, that would throw the HSTS error.
16:47:19 <strcat[m]> the only reason our connectivity check URL would be relevant is if what you tried to open is https://connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org/
16:47:39 <strcat[m]> sst_76: be clear
16:47:40 <strcat[m]> what URL
16:47:47 <strcat[m]> what URL did you open in the browser
16:47:50 <sst_76> Hang on
16:48:13 <strcat[m]> you need to give a clear explanation of what you did, such as pressing a notification from the OS and say what it opened
16:51:48 <seashield[m]> Quick question about Graphene/AOSP encryption, if I may?
16:51:48 <seashield[m]> If my phone is on standby (ie as it would be if it were in my pocket during daily use), is the content
16:51:48 <seashield[m]> of my phone encrypted, or is it only encrypted when it is shut down (ie switched off)?
16:54:02 <sst_76> 1) connect to govt WiFi.
16:54:02 <sst_76> 2) receive "sign in to network" notification.
16:54:02 <sst_76> 3) click on notification.
16:54:02 <sst_76> 4) receive certificate error
16:54:02 <sst_76> 5) select "continue via browser"
16:54:02 <sst_76> 6) sign on page opens in Brave
16:54:03 <sst_76> 7) "when brave tried to connect to connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org this time, the website sent back unusual and incorrect credentials. This may happen when an attacker is pretending to be connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org, or a Wi-Fi sign-in screen has interrupted the connection.
16:54:03 <sst_76> ...
16:54:04 <sst_76> You cannot visit connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org right now because the website uses HSTS. Network errors and attacks are usually temporary, so this page will probably work later."
16:55:16 <strcat[m]> seashield: the data on storage is *always* encrypted
16:55:53 * r0tt0r[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gxGVkFLJaCoFqhskIPVAlqgJ/message.txt >
16:55:56 <strcat[m]> seashield: it's never stored unencrypted, that's not how disk encryption works
16:55:56 <seashield[m]> <strcat[m] "seashield: the data on storage i"> Thanks, good to know.
16:56:10 <strcat[m]> seashield: when you're logged into a profile, the encryption key for the data stored in that profile is available to the OS
16:56:13 <strcat[m]> including when the screen is locked, until you logout of the profile
16:56:28 <strcat[m]> secondary profiles can be logged out at all time
16:57:18 <strcat[m]> sst_76:  okay that makes sense, that's indeed an issue
16:57:33 <strcat[m]> sst_76: you should just connect to another URL like http://neverssl.com/
16:58:08 <strcat[m]> perhaps we should buy another domain for the connectivity checks for when browsers try to open them, they do work as captive portal / connectivity checks already though
16:58:11 <strcat[m]> you can use the standard URLs if you want
16:58:12 <strcat[m]> you don't need them though
16:59:07 <sst_76> So I tried to go to google.com in browser and it redirected me to connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org
16:59:18 <sst_76> So I will switch it to google and see what happens.
16:59:20 <strcat[m]> sst_76: connectivity checks are definitely working fine as is though
16:59:35 <strcat[m]> there's a difference between that and whether you can use a browser to open that URL
16:59:42 <strcat[m]> behind a captive portal
16:59:44 <arpysco[m]> strcat: Thanks for keeping the Google captive portal check as an option in GOS, it's nice not having to out myself as a Graphene user whenever I connect to a public network.
16:59:45 <sst_76> OK.
17:00:06 <strcat[m]> google.com won't work either, that uses HSTS / HTTPS
17:00:14 <strcat[m]> you have to use neverssl.com
17:00:26 <sst_76> OK I will try that.
17:01:06 <strcat[m]> anyway as I said above
17:01:48 <strcat[m]> we could register another domain so that you don't need to do that
17:02:59 <strcat[m]> but our connectivity / captive portal checks work fine as is
17:03:33 <sst_76> I also tried ace.mu.nu , which I believe is also never secured, if that makes a difference.
17:05:12 <strcat[m]> and you have the option to use the standard ones
17:36:53 <strcat[m]> Calyx was supposedly collaborating with us but instead they've focused on causing harm to us through giving a platform to people to spread misinformation about GrapheneOS while doing their best to support it and take advantage of it. Not going to be collaborating with people who on the one hand claim to support our project while at the same time they aid Copperhead and others in causing harm to it. I've tried to reach
17:36:53 <strcat[m]> out to them and they've made it clear they don't want to hear from us anymore. Their developers / contributors are no longer welcome in our community and promoting it here is no longer permitted, as with Copperhead.
17:37:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Do captive portal checks get sent if you're using a VPN/proxy?
17:37:12 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer:  yes, but through the VPN
17:37:16 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't work
17:37:19 <ruddo[m]> <strcat[m] "Calyx was supposedly collaborati"> How did you reach these conclusions?
17:37:41 <strcat[m]> through them giving a platform to James Donaldson to spread misinformation about GrapheneOS, along with others
17:37:53 <strcat[m]> and the fact that they response to people spreading falsehoods / attacks on us in a way that gives support to it
17:37:53 <ruddo[m]> <strcat[m] "through them giving a platform t"> Yes, I would like specifics on that.
17:37:56 <strcat[m]> while trying to keep their hands clean
17:38:26 <strcat[m]> they permit him to use their channels to spread misinformation and actively engage with him / legitimize it, along with making misleading claims themselves
17:38:53 <ruddo[m]> OK hang on, where did you see this?
17:39:11 <strcat[m]> on a regular basis in their channels and subreddit
17:39:33 <strcat[m]> also, tired of them gaslighting me and falsely pretending to supporting us
17:39:33 <xenonverse-com> Why on the reviews of Pixel 4a do people say the battery is poor, when GOS users get 8-14 hours SOT?
17:39:54 <strcat[m]> xenonverse-com: probably mean in comparison to a Pixel 4 XL?
17:40:03 <strcat[m]> although it really depends on what you're doing
17:40:22 <strcat[m]> for example if you're running a game that renders at native resolution
17:40:42 <strcat[m]> you're likely going to have significantly worse battery life on a device that has a higher resolution
17:40:47 <strcat[m]> even if it has a somewhat larger battery
17:41:42 <strcat[m]> on the other hand, something like playing a movie is so well hardware accelerated that the resolution may not make a substantial difference
17:41:47 <cyborgninjaneer[> Wasn't seedvault from Calyx?
17:42:08 <strcat[m]> no, it existed before CalyxOS and they contributed to it to make it better
17:42:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> Oh
17:42:21 <strcat[m]> and it's still an independent project - at least according to the person they've paid to work on it
17:42:28 <strcat[m]> I specifically reached out to them and asked them about this based on concern about CalyxOS
17:42:42 <strcat[m]> we're going to stop using CalyxOS as the base for our setup wizard and switch to the LineageOS one which is what they forked, since we don't want any of the changes made to it by CalyxOS
17:49:38 <ruddo[m]> Question: why do you care if they are assholes, if their code is good?
17:49:58 <ruddo[m]> You have permission by license to use it.  Use it.
17:52:22 <strcat[m]> I don't want to use code from untrustworthy people
17:52:29 <strcat[m]> and we have no use for their SetupWizard fork
17:52:46 <strcat[m]> we might as well just use the LineageOS one instead of having a downstream project in the way
17:52:52 <strcat[m]> we don't use any of their changes to it anymore
17:52:58 <strcat[m]> and it's just a more out-of-date version of it
17:53:06 <ruddo[m]> If the LineageOS fork does the exact same or is functionally equivalent, IDGAF.  If the CalyxOS fork is somehow better, it doesn't matter if you can't trust them — what matters is whether the code is trustworthy.
17:53:19 <strcat[m]> the LineageOS one is the upstream project
17:53:24 <ruddo[m]> I don't trust or mistrust people when I can trust or mistrust code.
17:53:29 <strcat[m]> we do not use any of the CalyxOS changes to it downstream
17:53:54 <ruddo[m]> Cool then, their setup wizard is the same = IDGAF.
17:54:02 <ruddo[m]> 😀
17:54:03 <strcat[m]> yeah, well, I do not have the ability to fully review the entirety of each upstream project
17:54:18 <strcat[m]> ruddo: it will just be a newer version of the same thing
17:54:28 <strcat[m]> we have no reason to be using an out-of-date fork that I can see
17:54:50 <strcat[m]> also they've framed us using it as "profiting off their work" and I'm done with them
17:54:56 <ruddo[m]> K.  For the record, regardless of whatever drama may exist behind the scenes, I doubt Calyx will add anything malevolent to the code.  That would be monumentally idiotic and self-destructive.
17:55:22 <strcat[m]> ruddo: they don't need to, they don't have the last 3 months of security patch levels, right?
17:55:26 <strcat[m]> why would they need to add anything malevolent
17:55:31 <ohbeejay[m]> Hello! I'm a newb and have graphene on my phone thanks to the help of you all, but have a couple of questions.
17:56:35 <ruddo[m]> <strcat[m] "why would they need to add anyth"> I was referring to adding malevolence to the setup wizard GOS used and doesn't plan to use anymore.
18:01:51 <LesleyLesbian> Please add a charging percentage to offline charging mode
18:02:59 <ohbeejay[m]> Yesterday the lower 2/3rds of my phone's screen started to flash and blink uncontrollably, which only stopped until I shut off my phone. When I turned it on, I noticed that changing the brightness stopped it, but only temporarily. I assumed this was due to a screen malfunction (because I would occasionally see the blinking at boot, so I started uninstalling things to send to a repair person. This morning, I turned on
18:02:59 <ohbeejay[m]> the phone and it's not having any issue. Is this a known software issue in GrapheneOS?
18:03:46 <LesleyLesbian> It hasnt happened to me
18:03:50 <LesleyLesbian> What device are you using?
18:03:57 <strcat[m]> ohbeejay: no, not a known issue or something that I've heard of before, sounds like a hardware issue
18:03:58 <strcat[m]> expect that even if it went away, it starts happening again
18:03:58 <ruddo[m]> Sounds like a hardware issue.
18:03:59 <strcat[m]> I'd get it replaced while you can
18:04:00 <strcat[m]> if it's on warranty
18:04:02 <ohbeejay[m]> I got it used, but will look into a replacement. Thank you.
18:04:09 <strcat[m]> well, might as well keep using it then
18:04:13 <strcat[m]> but it sounds like a hardware issue with the screen
18:04:14 <strcat[m]> it could just be a loose connection though
18:04:14 <ohbeejay[m]> <strcat[m] "well, might as well keep using i"> It is super annoying
18:04:23 <LesleyLesbian> Pixels have weak screen durability from tests Ive seen
18:04:27 <strcat[m]> I'd guess there's a high chance of it being a loose connection
18:04:32 <LesleyLesbian> So it might be good to get a stiff case for your pixel
18:04:33 <strcat[m]> LesleyLesbian: you mean when the device is actually off?
18:04:48 <LesleyLesbian> Yes I turn off the phone to charge it
18:05:01 <strcat[m]> LesleyLesbian: we can't change the firmware one when it doesn't have enough power to boot the OS
18:05:05 <LesleyLesbian> And the little battry icon should have an accompanying charge % percentage
18:05:15 <strcat[m]> there are 2 of those screens: low-level firmware (when it doesn't have enough power to boot the OS) and healthd
18:05:20 <LesleyLesbian> Theres a little battery icon indicating charge-fullness
18:05:22 <strcat[m]> they look similar but are different
18:05:26 <LesleyLesbian> It would be good if it had a percentage
18:05:42 <LesleyLesbian> It has power to boot
18:05:46 <LesleyLesbian> Its at like 70% then I charge it
18:05:59 <LesleyLesbian> The charging icon should also have a % showing charge completion
18:06:05 <LesleyLesbian> battery charge levels *Spock voice*
18:06:20 <strcat[m]> the UX for charging also varies since some devices automatically boot the normal OS when they get power again
18:06:44 <strcat[m]> ohbeejay: it's probably a loose connection based on your description, so maybe having a repair person take it apart and put it back together would be enough to fix it
18:06:46 <strcat[m]> LesleyLesbian: it's better not to do that
18:06:54 <strcat[m]> LesleyLesbian: the OS charging is faster than the firmware charging
18:07:04 <ohbeejay[m]> <strcat[m] "ohbeejay: it's probably a loose "> yeah will do. makes sense. Thanks!
18:07:20 <strcat[m]> I think the firmware charging is more conservative
18:07:48 <strcat[m]> so I guess it's probably healthd then
18:07:52 <LesleyLesbian> yeah the current battery icon is good enough
18:07:59 <LesleyLesbian> It would just be nice to have the percentage %
18:08:16 <LesleyLesbian> Does Graphene OS drain the battery faster than stock android?
18:08:31 <LesleyLesbian> Or is it the same, or save battery ?
18:08:42 <LesleyLesbian>  Because the phone doesnt ping google, Id imagine the battery life could last longer
18:08:59 <LesleyLesbian>  What are the weaknesses of Graphene OS?
18:09:09 <LesleyLesbian> Backdoored applications? Stingrays/IMSI Catchers?
18:09:23 <LesleyLesbian> I think we should red team Graphene to make it more secure
18:09:26 <LesleyLesbian> Theoretically
18:09:29 <jpds> LesleyLesbian: There's a battery percentage option in the settings
18:09:39 <LesleyLesbian> Yes thats when the device is fully on
18:10:03 <LesleyLesbian> Is there any APP sandbox service I can run to test if an application is backdoored?
18:16:32 <LesleyLesbian> Is GOS fully encrypted once I set a pin/passphrase?
18:16:58 <LesleyLesbian> How can I check? The full disk encrypted setttings?
18:17:05 <brenneke[m]> <strcat[m] "the only reason our connectivity"> Just curious:
18:18:29 <jpds> LesleyLesbian: Android's had encryption by default for some years now
18:18:56 <LesleyLesbian> Full disk ecnryption? Does GOS improve upon the FDE any way? Such as a stronger cipher?
18:19:27 <jpds> LesleyLesbian: I recommend having a good read of all the information on grapheneos.org
18:19:54 <strcat[m]> brenneke: there is no connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org page
18:20:43 <LesleyLesbian> maybe the server recognizes the mere fact that the webpage is loaded at all
18:20:53 <LesleyLesbian> And consider a successful 404 page load, internet connectivity
18:21:11 <LesleyLesbian> An indication of working internet connectivity
18:21:40 <strcat[m]> brenneke: the OS uses https://connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org/generate_204 to check for connectivity, it returns a 204 response code
18:21:45 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to be a web page that users open themselves
18:21:54 <LesleyLesbian> Nice!
18:22:02 <LesleyLesbian> ;)  *Guy Fawkes Smiles*
18:22:17 <strcat[m]> the server doesn't do anything beyond serving a 204 response code for /generate_204
18:22:18 <strcat[m]> that's the point
18:22:19 <strcat[m]> it's not up to the server to do anything else
18:22:29 <strcat[m]> the OS uses the fact that it can get the proper response code to an HTTP(S) GET request of /generate_204 to indicate that there's internet connectivity
18:22:33 <strcat[m]> the server doesn't recognize anything
18:22:41 <strcat[m]> that's a standard approach used across operating systems
18:22:42 <strcat[m]> including iOS and elsewhere
18:22:54 <strcat[m]> the only thing that appears to be an issue is that once it has detected there isn't connectivity and has determined that it's due to a captive portal
18:23:13 <strcat[m]> the URL it asks a web browser to open doesn't work for that purpose
18:23:26 <LesleyLesbian> perfect
18:23:30 <strcat[m]> due to HSTS for grapheneos.org
18:23:37 <LesleyLesbian> Does the GOS team reccomend any specific VPN companies, Server Countries, or Protocols?
18:23:42 <strcat[m]> so we'll need another domain to make that work as expected in browsers
18:23:42 <LesleyLesbian> Im using Wireguard with Mullvad app
18:24:03 <LesleyLesbian> usually connecting to non-14 eyes countries such as Africa/Romania
18:24:12 <strcat[m]> this was just our initial deployment though, it made sense to use the existing domain
18:24:23 <strcat[m]> no
18:25:31 <TheJollyRoger> LesleyLesbian: Adam####, know it's you.
18:25:32 <LesleyLesbian> thank you friend
18:25:48 <TheJollyRoger> *I know it's you.
18:25:52 <LesleyLesbian> *TIPS Greyhat and putson sunglasses in dramatic exit*
18:25:54 <TheJollyRoger> Stop playing us.
18:28:31 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "LesleyLesbian: Adam####, know it"> Lol.....was just thinking that too!
18:29:03 <TheJollyRoger> I asked him to stay away for seven days, and then I'd be willing to consider his apology.
18:29:17 <TheJollyRoger> That is now off the table.
18:29:43 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: heh, yeah.
18:31:47 <aragorndr[m]> What exactly is AOSP Alliance?
18:31:52 <aragorndr[m]> And how important it is for GOS?
18:33:00 <strcat[m]> it's not important
18:33:20 <strcat[m]> it was supposed to be an organization for collaboration between projects based on AOSP
18:33:49 <strcat[m]> we can do things on our own as we've always done in the past
18:41:01 <fll[m]> <strcat[m] "Calyx was supposedly collaborati"> Sad to hear that. Did not expect those guys to not take a stand against JD/CH :(
18:45:55 <MorsThagalis> Hi Guys! I Need help, first time trying to install GrapheneOS on a Pixel 3, and guess what, fastboot is too old.. can't find any way to make it work. doing it from win10.
18:51:19 <fll[m]> MorsThagalis: I guess you followed https://grapheneos.org/install ?
18:52:22 <fll[m]> Because if so you must have missed something. Fe. do everything in one power shell window. Don't close it
18:54:46 <MorsThagalis> yeah but i cant find a fastboot version that isnt too old
18:56:12 <fll[m]> The ones linked ( https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools ) are too old?
18:56:47 <fll[m]> That would be weird and I'd be lost too then
18:58:39 <fll[m]> What is the version it sees when you put in 'fastboot --version'?
19:15:14 <MorsThagalis> im too dumb to make it work -_-
19:15:25 <pacman37[m]> strcat strcat  : Do you think the new standard: Oblivious DNS-over-HTTPS differ significantly from DoH or add much?

19:16:17 <nscnt> MorsThagalis: Do you use the PowerShell?
19:16:56 <MorsThagalis> nope
19:17:12 <MorsThagalis> should i?
19:21:48 <nscnt> MorsThagalis: Yes, you should.
19:21:58 <nscnt> As stated in the installation guide
19:37:30 <TheJollyRoger> MorsThagalis: if you are not using PowerShell, then you will get "Fastboot too old" because cmd does not support the logic needed to make the safety check properly and errors out.
19:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> Even though some people have advocated bypassing the safety check, please don't do this, because the safety check was added to prevent people from corrupting the OS install.
19:40:35 <MorsThagalis> thanks guys
19:40:40 <MorsThagalis> i manage to do it via powershell
19:41:04 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
20:15:12 <njha[m]> Is there a way to bypass the anti-screenshot thing built into some apps
20:15:57 <njha[m]> I remember there's something for rooted devices but we don't really have root :)
20:20:10 <oldman_newuser> hey there.  Just following up from last night :-)   I got my compiled version of grapheneos installed.  I had failed to finish the instructions and was trying to flash using 'fastbiot flashall -w'  before signing the build and having it zipped up properly.  So wanted to report that verizon visual voicemail is still now working for me.  when I
20:20:11 <oldman_newuser> diffed packages/services/Telephony/  between graphene and aosp it seems whole sections related to carrierconfig and simconfig have been pruned.  Is this something that grapheneos considers important ?  How should I follow up if so?  maybe open an issue ?  I can help test but am not a programmer.  thanks for all the hard work on grapheneos
20:21:23 <oldman_newuser> all I really need is some type of notification that a voicemail message is waiting
20:23:09 <oldman_newuser> s/now/not
20:24:23 <joehandcockandja> Mine says there's a voicemail when there is one without any config on ATT
20:26:17 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: what exactly do you mean by AOSP
20:26:41 <strcat[m]> we haven't pruned anything from there
20:28:29 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tZbXnZtTAkqNTpLIZcRUxwIc/message.txt >
20:28:45 <strcat[m]> here's the diff of GrapheneOS packages/services/Telephony with AOSP
20:28:51 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you think you're comparing with
20:29:00 <oldman_newuser> I followed this https://source.android.com/setup/build/building and used a release or tag that matched the latest  https://developers.google.com/android/images
20:29:46 <strcat[m]> RQ1A.201205.010 (android-11.0.0_r20) is the most recent stable release of AOSP in the normal maintenance release branch
20:30:01 <strcat[m]> what I posted above is the diff of that to GrapheneOS
20:30:24 <strcat[m]> I don't know why you're saying we pruned substantial amounts of code, all we do is change the value of a boolean in the resources
20:30:35 <oldman_newuser> strcat[m]  thanks for the reply. I started several dir higher which could be a mistake .jperkins@aosp:~/grapheneos-RQ1A.201205.003.2020.12.08.08/packages/services$ diff -x .git -x strings.xml -r Telephony/ ~/src/packages/services/Telephony/ | less
20:31:07 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound like you're comparing to the latest stable release of AOSP
20:31:10 <strcat[m]> don't know what you're comparing against but it's not that
20:31:22 <strcat[m]> the complete diff is what I posted above
20:33:36 <strcat[m]> android11-qpr1-release is the current main AOSP branch (1st quarterly maintenance branch for Android 11) and the latest tag for that branch isandroid-11.0.0_r20 (RQ1A.201205.010)
20:33:43 <strcat[m]>  * android11-qpr1-release is the current main AOSP branch (1st quarterly maintenance branch for Android 11) and the latest tag for that branch is android-11.0.0_r20 (RQ1A.201205.010)
20:34:47 <strcat[m]> njha: you can bypass the screenshot thing with adb, a device manager, an accessibility service, the screen recording option, etc.
20:34:57 <strcat[m]> njha: different options
20:35:06 <strcat[m]> what they disable is the keybind to do a screenshot, that's it really
20:35:20 <strcat[m]> idea is essentially supposed to be stopping you accidentally taking a screenshot of something sensitive
20:35:32 <strcat[m]> and it removes the app contents from being listed in recent apps, etc.
20:35:43 <strcat[m]> Signal has a setting to toggle it on / off
20:36:19 <xenonverse-com> strcat[m] Is there a method of taking screenshots of UK banking apps, under GOS. Screen recording wouldn't work, I know ADB does, but I'd prefer an on-device solution.
20:36:31 <oldman_newuser> Ok.  I am sure I am mistaken.  Where is the proper place to open an issue where I can post some screenshots of the missing 4th tab (voicemail ) and the differences in the default dialer-->settings--->Voicemail
20:38:37 <oldman_newuser> I have flashed Graphene(binary and source), LOS, Calyx, google_official, and AOSP within the last week.  Graphene is the only one where VMM is unavailable on a Pixel3xl on Verizon
20:39:03 <oldman_newuser> did notice Calyx is several months behind. August if I recall
20:41:48 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: GrapheneOS is based on Android 11
20:41:54 <strcat[m]> how many of the things that you tested other than the stock OS are?
20:42:04 <strcat[m]> you say you tested AOSP, what do you mean by AOSP, you built AOSP 11 with android-prepare-vendor?
20:42:18 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't have official builds released
20:42:20 <strcat[m]> other than from the master branch
20:42:58 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: since Android 11, people have been having problems with visual voicemail on GrapheneOS, due to upstream changes
20:43:01 <strcat[m]> on some carriers
20:43:37 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: so, if you're comparing to OSes that are not up-to-date and don't have the current OS version or current security patches (they come together, for Pixels, you don't get one without the other)
20:43:43 <oldman_newuser> strcat[m] repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-11.0.0_r17  this is what I built aosp
20:44:14 <strcat[m]> android-11.0.0_r20 is the current release now (that was last month) and what did you use to build it?
20:44:19 <strcat[m]> did you use android-prepare-vendor?
20:44:35 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: it sounds like you might have built an incomplete OS and continued using the stock OS vendor and product images
20:44:44 <strcat[m]> including a bunch of Verizon apps in product which aren't part of AOSP
20:44:52 <oldman_newuser>  61  tar -xg google_devices-crosshatch-rp1a.201105.002-454e3547.tgz    62  tar -xf google_devices-crosshatch-rp1a.201105.002-454e3547.tgz    63  ls   64  ./extract-google_devices-crosshatch.sh    65  ls   66  tar -xf qcom-crosshatch-rp1a.201105.002-4bd5167f.tgz    67  ls   68  ./extract-qcom-crosshatch.sh
20:45:00 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: you aren't comparing to AOSP, you're comparing to *something* you think is AOSP
20:45:04 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: yeah that's not a complete OS
20:45:09 <strcat[m]> you were partially using the stock OS
20:45:16 <oldman_newuser> I believe is how I got the vendor bits into the aosp
20:45:29 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: compare GrapheneOS with AOSP + android-prepare-vendor, same tag
20:45:32 <strcat[m]> doubt there is a difference
20:45:52 <strcat[m]> perhaps android-prepare-vendor is missing something, or perhaps your carrier doesn't support Visual Voicemail without their bundled apps anymore
20:47:14 <oldman_newuser> Ok.  I am sure you are correct about  the source.  However I can use vmm without the bundled app.  It works on all the firmwares I listed above.     Where is the proper place to open an issue where I can post some screenshots of the missing 4th tab (voicemail ) and the differences in the default dialer-->settings--->Voicemail
20:48:16 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: again, it worked on GrapheneOS in Android 10
20:48:35 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: comparing against OSes that are based on Android 10 is unhelpful because we already know it worked on GrapheneOS before
20:48:59 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: Android 11 has been out since September and is required to full security updates on Pixels - you're comparing largely against out-of-date, insecure OSes
20:49:14 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: we were aware that we lost support for this as part of moving to production builds of Android 11
20:49:25 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: what you built with AOSP is not a production release providing a full OS
20:49:51 <strcat[m]> compare GrapheneOS with the current AOSP tag (android-11.0.0_r20) using android-prepare-vendor and I expect you get the same result
20:50:16 <strcat[m]> oldman_newuser: there's an open issue on the tracker already, you're welcome to help with it
20:50:43 <oldman_newuser> ty for your time.  I will try to locate the issue on the tracker then
20:51:47 <strcat[m]> we don't strip anything out and the diff for that repo is what I posted above
20:52:05 <strcat[m]> we do use android-prepare-vendor to provide production, fully signed builds of the full OS
20:52:44 <strcat[m]> perhaps we simply need to revert enabling VVM3 and it will work via a different mechanism - I don't know, you're welcome to test
20:53:37 <strcat[m]> but it's unhelpful to compare to Android 10: it worked fine on GrapheneOS with Android 10, the problem is something to do with the migration to Android 11
20:53:51 <strcat[m]> perhaps it's an android-prepare-vendor issue
20:54:06 <strcat[m]> perhaps reverting enabling VVM3 will allow it to work another way if that doesn't work as is anymore
20:54:18 <strcat[m]> no one with access to the carrier has looked into it
20:54:30 <strcat[m]> I can't, Verizon doesn't exist here
20:54:33 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1 similarly can't
20:54:37 <oldman_newuser> ty.  I found the issue on the tracker.  https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/356  .  I will follow up there.
20:55:19 <oldman_newuser> yes that would make it hard to troubleshoot without using that carrier. I agree.
20:57:17 <oldman_newuser> now I see that the calyx is android 10 also
20:59:44 <oldman_newuser> I will research the android-prepare-vendor .  I dont remember that when I compiled aosp.  I do remember getting the proprietary binaries though
21:00:58 <oldman_newuser> thanks again for your time and effort with me and grapheneos.  I am off to work now :-)   see y'all later
21:29:27 <digiscales[m]> I just switched matrix server migrated account off topic didn't migrate
21:29:44 <digiscales[m]> Can't find in search room however this group migrated fine
21:48:00 <Janik[m]> I just installed grapheneOS on my pixel 4a when I start I see a yellow triangle. Is this nromal?
21:48:34 <r0tt0r[m]> <Janik[m] "I just installed grapheneOS on m"> yes
21:48:54 <Janik[m]> alritght, thx  thought I failed to lock the bootloader
21:49:40 <strcat[m]> it means you locked it
21:49:43 <r0tt0r[m]> <Janik[m] "alritght, thx  thought I failed "> its just a warning that you dont run stock.. all fine
22:40:40 <madaidan[m]> >jay joined the room

23:06:44 <mrxx_0[m]> Pratyush what version of the gcam do you have ? On my test device I have the version 7.4.201.322479879 and it's working fine on latest version of GrapheneOS.
23:07:24 <Pratyush[m]> I guess i have 7.5
23:10:17 <mrxx_0[m]> What's the app doing ? Can you open it ?
23:10:58 <mrxx_0[m]> Pratyush
23:13:16 <Pratyush[m]> <mrxx_0[m] "What's the app doing ? Can you o"> It's stuck on canera logo in center just in a min I send you screenshot
23:15:27 <mrxx_0[m]> Pm Pratyush
23:41:12 <Thatcher[m]> What's with the calendar app that comes with Graphene? It seems to have no functionality for me.
23:43:08 <dwkr[m]> It's a placeholder
23:43:28 <dwkr[m]> You'll want to download another calendar app if you want functionality
23:43:45 <Pratyush[m]> <Thatcher[m] "What's with the calendar app tha"> AOSP calendar apps doesn't offer anything so you should get one that you like.
23:44:14 <dwkr[m]> There are plans to replace a lot of the stock Graphene apps in the future with better versions, but there's a lot of higher priority work atm
23:45:56 <dwkr[m]> I've been using Simple Calendar because I had issues importing ical calendars into eTar. Both are pretty similar visually.
