00:01:37 <lev[m]> <LogsOnVar[m] "Do you know if Google Maps work?"> yes, it works, microG is not needed
00:05:53 <lev[m]> is there some more stable way to transfer files to an android device?
00:06:34 <lev[m]> I've generally been useing `android-file-transfer` to do it over MTP, it'll copy large amounts of data without issue, but if you try to write more than like 500 consecutive MB, it'll crash
00:21:30 <LogsOnVar[m]> <lev[m] "yes, it works, microG is not nee"> Wow, I thought that Google Maps depends on Google Play Services, if MicroG is not needed in order to work then I'm switching to GrapheneOS, thanks a lot for clarifying ;)
00:23:32 <lev[m]> as I understand it, it's needed to log in, and to use features related to your google account LogsOnVar
00:23:50 <lev[m]> I don't use the full maps app, but occaisonally I'll use maps go
00:24:06 <lev[m]> since maps is hard to beat for planning routes via public transit/walking/biking
00:25:15 <M8942w[m]> OK I'm following the instructions on GrapheneOS install and downloaded the platform-tools.
00:25:15 <M8942w[m]> but what does "add tools to PATH in the current shell" mean? what is PATH?
00:25:40 <lev[m]> an environmental variable
00:25:40 <lev[m]> what OS are you using?
00:26:19 <M8942w[m]> windows 10
00:26:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> [8942w](https://matrix.to/#/@8942w:matrix.org) pm me if you need remote support
00:28:14 <lev[m]> just in case anyone else looks this up, the `android-file-transfer` crashing thing seems like it has to do with timing out: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/1792085
00:28:18 <lev[m]> can be manually adjusted
00:29:50 <M8942w[m]> anupritaisno1: remote support?
00:30:32 <lev[m]> he's offering to teamviewer your troubles away :)
00:32:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Indian custamur suppory is here
00:32:48 <sphinxcat[m]> > what is teamviewer?
00:33:30 <louipc> remote control desktop
00:37:31 <M8942w[m]> is there a vid i can watch that will explain the words used in GrapheneOS/install?
00:38:42 <louipc> hmm i heard theres some videos explaining the install but they don't follow the correct procedure
00:39:04 <louipc> .. just in case you find any.. but might help you gain some understanding
00:40:37 <LinusSexTips[m]> he need tech suppert
00:41:52 <LinusSexTips[m]> so you have the standalone platform tools, right?
00:42:41 <M8942w[m]> yes in zip form
00:43:37 <M8942w[m]> platform tools_r30.0.4-windows
00:46:09 <LinusSexTips[m]> extract that and the factory image to the same folder
00:46:29 * LinusSexTips[m] uploaded an image: image.png (11KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/enURGNupxVqWZanmBjvaiOnw/image.png >
00:46:39 <LinusSexTips[m]> so that it looks like this
00:51:12 <M8942w[m]> OK made new folder and put them both there
00:52:00 <LinusSexTips[m]> alright, now open powershell as admin and cd into that folder
00:52:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "alright, now open powershell as "> No
00:52:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> As standard user
00:53:08 <LinusSexTips[m]> oh, ive always done it as admin
00:55:43 <M8942w[m]> I right clicked on the folder and it did not have powershell on it. how do i open powershell into the folder?
00:57:02 <M8942w[m]> oh wait how do i get in to power shell?
00:57:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <M8942w[m] "I right clicked on the folder an"> Shift+right click
00:57:51 <M8942w[m]> thank you
00:59:00 <M8942w[m]> ok did it
01:03:00 <M8942w[m]> is this what "add tools to PATH in the current shell" means?
01:04:51 <LinusSexTips[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
01:05:19 <LinusSexTips[m]> Did you add the tools to your path?
01:05:25 <LinusSexTips[m]> with the command
01:09:34 <M8942w[m]> it is showing the folders path address on the powershell
01:11:27 <M8942w[m]> do i need to ad platform-tools specifically?
01:14:04 <M8942w[m]> i named the folder with both extracted files GrapheneOS. that folder is what is on the powershell
01:16:26 <LinusSexTips[m]> uhh
01:16:40 <LinusSexTips[m]> when you click on the platform tools folder, is there another folder inside?
01:16:50 <LinusSexTips[m]>  * when you open on the platform tools folder, is there another folder inside?
01:16:57 <LinusSexTips[m]>  * when you open the platform tools folder, is there another folder inside?
01:25:01 <M8942w[m]> yes. i extracted sargo-factory-2020.10.01.23.zip and platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip in to my new folder called "GrapheneOS".  in that folder is platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows and in that folder is platform-tools
01:25:46 <M8942w[m]> sorry for the confusion
01:30:37 <LinusSexTips[m]> ok, bring the platform-tools folder into the GrapheneOS folder, then get rid of the platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows
01:30:52 <LinusSexTips[m]> then add the tools to your path in powershell
01:34:40 <jacksen> Understood sorry for the late reply thanks for your help
01:35:15 <jacksen> is it just possible though just to say get the talkback apk or the google accessibility sweet and not let it effect the phones security on the signuture check spoofing permission?
01:35:24 <M8942w[m]> ok so i type cd then the path address right?
01:35:36 <jacksen> or does that apk need other google librarys to functionor doe
01:36:24 <jacksen> I mean I am not intrested in the google camera
01:36:39 <M8942w[m]>  * ok so i type cd then the path address of platform-tools right?
01:43:08 <M8942w[m]>  * ok so i type cd then add the path address of platform-tools right?
02:19:25 <LogsOnVar[m]> <lev[m] "as I understand it, it's needed "> Nah, it's ok, I just need the experience of gasoline spots or restaurants nearby and the navigation mode... Idc about using anymore useless features and some fancy shit with an account lmao
02:21:12 <lev[m]> right, so maps go is probably plenty for you, but it also sounds like OsmAnd+ would suit your needs too
02:35:40 <LogsOnVar[m]> <lev[m] "right, so maps go is probably pl"> Tbh I have also OsmAnd+ but its not that complete as GMaps since there are places that doesn't appear in the Openstreetmap database... And I depend on it for daily use, that's why I'm still using GMaps.  Let's see if in a future the Openstreetmap Database gets far better and I can replace it as my daily driver navigation app.
02:54:20 <lev[m]> you can download other databases (e.g. wikipedia), but yeah I agree, it's not quite as full
02:54:58 <lev[m]> the fuzzy search is also not nearly as good, I used osmand to drive up to an obscure place and it would only find it by the specific address, rather than just a street number
05:26:03 <Biv[m]> <LogsOnVar[m] "Tbh I have also OsmAnd+ but its "> have you tried maps.me?
05:26:08 <Biv[m]> pretty good
06:26:47 <mastercakex[m]> Maps.me belongs to Russians which is Russian government project
06:26:58 <mastercakex[m]> * Maps.me belongs to Yandex which is Russian government project
06:27:36 <mastercakex[m]> Osm sucks bigtiem. It looks like it's stuck in the early 2000s

06:42:22 <Nicklaj> Hi. I'd like to port the rom on an lg g5. I have a lot of experience when it comes to programming but not so much when it comes to rom porting, can anyone point me towards like, where to start?
06:42:47 <Nicklaj> When I port an OS I have to work not on the OS itself but on the kernel, right?
06:43:47 <JTL> Nicklaj: Not something I'd personally recommend but I suggest you talk to anupritaisno1[m]
06:43:51 <JTL> > 23:42 <Nicklaj> When I port an OS I have to work not on the OS itself but on the kernel, right?
06:43:53 <JTL> Yes
06:44:16 <Nicklaj> Why is it something that you don't recommend?
06:44:59 <JTL> If you're looking to match the security of existing Pixel devices, you're not going to get there
06:45:03 <JTL> (ref: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices)
06:45:19 <JTL> But if it's a learning project or something I'm not going to stop you
06:46:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Nicklaj](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_Nicklaj:matrix.org) glassrom then
06:47:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Nicklaj](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_Nicklaj:matrix.org) set up a lineage build environment, run the glassrom script and the build as user
06:48:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> You simply don't have proper vendor support to do aosp
06:48:59 <Nicklaj> Yeah I know that the LG G5 sucks a lot, that's why I was trying to port grapheneos on it
06:49:35 <Nicklaj> (anupritaisno1[m]) [Nicklaj](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_Nicklaj:matrix.org) set up a lineage build environment, run the glassrom script and the build as user
06:49:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Nicklaj "Yeah I know that the LG G5 sucks"> Glassrom is probably the closest you'll get
06:49:50 <Nicklaj> Can I join the IRC only via matrix?
06:50:11 <Nicklaj> What exactly is glassroom?
06:54:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not sure what you're asking
06:54:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also there's a huge chance glassrom won't boot at all
06:54:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a reason why pixels are supported
06:54:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google is quick to fix most issues
06:54:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You might run into bugs solved ages ago on pixels
06:54:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> * You might run into bugs solved ages ago on pixels on your phone
06:55:23 <Nicklaj> Yeah I haven't quite understood what glassroom is though
06:59:18 <JTL> TL:DR As I understand it, glassrom is anu's project to make non GrapheneOS "compliant" devices slightly less awful
07:18:24 <Nicklaj> Oh okay
07:18:31 <Nicklaj> Interesting
07:56:40 <Partyush[m]> Hello,
07:56:40 <Partyush[m]> Pixel 2 & pixel 2 xl will not get get any android update after december 2020 will graphene os will continue to support it with latest security patch or it's also going to get discontinued from graphene os to?

09:11:12 <renlord> i have matrix too, i just dont use it much
09:11:23 <renlord> its not as snappy as IRC
09:12:38 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "Resynth: ye"> Ahh ok good
09:13:28 <Resynth[m]> renlord: interactive or full?
09:13:45 <renlord> crash it, then collect a full one
09:16:50 <Resynth[m]> Woah I just got a crash
09:16:53 <Resynth[m]> Quick what do I do?
09:17:03 <renlord[m]> collect the bug report now
09:17:18 <renlord[m]> the logs get cached for a while
09:22:44 <webb[m]> How would I report general stability issues?
09:22:53 <webb[m]> I'm on a PX3XL
09:23:38 <renlord> webb[m]: what does general stability issues mean?
09:23:59 <renlord> we can only address re-producible issues
09:24:11 <renlord> can fix something that cant be re-produced
09:24:17 <renlord> s/can/cant/
09:24:34 <webb[m]> General lag/lock ups that require a restart/apps not staying open in the background
09:24:50 <webb[m]> Oh
09:25:19 <renlord[m]> apps not staying "open" in background is not an issue, the oomkiller is meant to reap background processes if they are stale
09:26:32 <renlord[m]> if it is a background process that is meant to be a live service, it is an issue for app developer to resolve
09:26:34 <webb[m]> It's bad enough that when I have only one other app open and switch it dies
09:26:39 <webb[m]> And it wasn't like this before
09:26:44 <renlord[m]> they need to pass the correct task flags in the manifest
09:26:52 <renlord[m]> the OS will respect those flags
09:26:59 <webb[m]> And I tested it on a clean restart with only two apps ever opened in that session
09:27:12 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "crash it, then collect a full on"> Hmm, how?
09:27:34 <renlord[m]> power button > 3 dots > bug report
09:27:44 <renlord[m]> Resynth: ^
09:27:45 <Resynth[m]> <webb[m] "And it wasn't like this before "> Personally, Android 11 has brought about a lot of stability issues
09:27:56 <Resynth[m]> Lemme check this a bit quick
09:28:01 <webb[m]> <Resynth[m] "Personally, Android 11 has broug"> There was some issues leading up to the 11 switch
09:28:37 <renlord[m]> afaik, from my day-to-day use android 11 is more stable than android 10
09:28:38 <renlord[m]> lol
09:28:38 <webb[m]> I noticed things slowly getting a bit slower and slower before 11 but it went into overdrive when 11 came out
09:29:07 <Resynth[m]> Well for me, Android 10 was super smooth
09:29:44 <Resynth[m]> ...wow.
09:29:47 <webb[m]> 10 was good when Graphene first switched but 9 was the smooth one for me
09:29:59 <renlord[m]> aged hardware can deteriorate in performance too.
09:30:05 <renlord[m]> for a number of reasons
09:30:15 <Resynth[m]> 9 and 10 were smooth for me tbh
09:30:21 <Resynth[m]> 11 has just ruined it
09:34:30 <Resynth[m]> <renlord[m] "aged hardware can deteriorate in"> No I disagree this time
09:34:38 <Resynth[m]> This phone was marvellous leading up to A10
09:34:58 <Resynth[m]> As soon as I updated, things were crashing, stuttering... just uch
09:36:39 <renlord> if you'd like to make a claim that grapheneos11 is unstable, you need to compare grapheneos11 to stock android11
09:37:33 <renlord> also, still waiting for bug report
09:39:02 <Resynth[m]> Sure, this is an old phone, but this is the update's fault
09:39:21 <Resynth[m]>  * Sure, this is an old phone, but this is definitely the fault of the Android 11 update
09:39:49 <Resynth[m]> I'm redacting personal information
09:40:32 <Resynth[m]> There are a lot of irrelevant lines from MediaProvider that include PII
09:43:15 <renlord> Resynth[m]: you can't blame an update if everyone else has not reported stability issues you face
09:43:36 <renlord> afaik, you're the only person who has all of these crashes occuring
09:44:30 <webb[m]> I'm having crash issues too
09:45:17 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "Resynth: you can't blame an upda"> But I can, this phone was fine before the update
09:45:20 <strcat[m]> sounds like you have failing hardware that you blame on updates
09:45:28 <strcat[m]> you say it has been gradually getting worse webb
09:45:36 <strcat[m]> what makes you so sure it has anything to do with specific updates?
09:45:40 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "afaik, you're the only person wh"> *webb will remember this*
09:45:54 <webb[m]> <strcat[m] "what makes you so sure it has an"> Because I notice it getting worse after updates
09:45:55 <strcat[m]> has not mentioned anything that overlaps with what you've said
09:46:08 <strcat[m]> webb: no you just notice it getting worse and blame it on updates
09:46:15 <webb[m]> And the latest one has completely wrecked the performance
09:46:21 <Resynth[m]> Alright who wants the bug report
09:46:23 <strcat[m]> definitely hasn't
09:46:55 <webb[m]> Because right after the update it started having all of these issues
09:47:20 <strcat[m]> which doesn't mean it had anything to do with an update
09:47:30 <strcat[m]> and what issues
09:47:44 <strcat[m]> name an issue you have and when did it start occurring
09:48:43 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "name an issue you have and when "> - Settings app crashes
09:48:53 <Resynth[m]> All since the latest update
09:48:58 <strcat[m]> Resynth: again sounds like failing hardware, and you haven't reported any of those
09:48:59 <Resynth[m]> The phone's fault 👁️
09:49:09 <strcat[m]> since the latest update?
09:49:22 <Resynth[m]> Yes
09:49:26 <strcat[m]> so with https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.10.06.02 you started having these issues
09:49:32 <Resynth[m]> P2XL
09:49:52 <Resynth[m]> Hang on
09:50:07 <strcat[m]> so give an example of one of these settings app crashes, you aren't being specific at all
09:50:42 <strcat[m]> and there is no report for any of these issues from anyone other than clock app UX issues (and it still works, just has UX annoyances)
09:50:56 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "so give an example of one of the"> I did earlier
09:50:59 <strcat[m]> so consider me skeptical when no one else seems to have these problems, just one person who seems to be a troll
09:51:00 <strcat[m]> where
09:51:03 <Resynth[m]> The whole bug report is that
09:51:21 <strcat[m]> I don't see any issue reports on the tracker
09:51:32 <strcat[m]> there are known clock app UX annoyances but it works
09:51:33 <renlord> Resynth[m]: iirc, data dir
09:51:51 <renlord> you can use the file explorer and then use matrix to send it to someone
09:52:29 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "there are known clock app UX ann"> The full-screen window has completely disappeared
09:52:41 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean by that
09:52:46 <strcat[m]> and it sounds like it does work for you
09:52:51 <strcat[m]> and you're just upset about UI changes
09:52:58 * webb[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pFOAlxLvTHXRgOblxTJHpItJ/message.txt >
09:52:59 <strcat[m]> and you're misrepresenting that as it not working
09:53:03 <Resynth[m]> I don't think you're listening to what I'm saying
09:53:09 <strcat[m]> I am listening
09:53:18 <strcat[m]> what you said is it doesn't work, and it sounds like it does work for you
09:53:24 <strcat[m]> so that's out of the way
09:53:27 <Resynth[m]> I just said it didn't tho
09:53:27 <strcat[m]> give an example of a Settings app crash
09:53:42 <strcat[m]> yes you said the clock app doesn't work, but it clearly works for you, and has a UI change you don't like
09:53:47 <Resynth[m]> I am sending a bug report that gives an example right now lol
09:54:03 <strcat[m]> want you to explain what you do to cause the crash
09:54:13 <strcat[m]> don't need logs if you aren't going to explain the issue
09:54:17 <Resynth[m]> Hold down an application icon on the home screen, navigate to its settings, then enter the permissions view. This immediately crashes the device. Furthermore, on this round it seems to have fully crashed the System UI process, turning off the phone screen and locking me out of it altogether.
09:54:42 * Resynth[m] uploaded an image: image.png (103KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/hDTJkJHqIZVLpoHwzHuZMbwY/image.png >
09:54:44 <Resynth[m]> strcat
09:54:49 <Resynth[m]> This has totally disappeared
09:54:54 <Resynth[m]> It seems like a glitch
09:55:05 <Resynth[m]> I just copied that from DDG
09:55:06 <strcat[m]> the UI for the clock app was substantially changed
09:55:17 <Resynth[m]> It's not the AOSP screen
09:55:20 <strcat[m]> that doesn't look like how the clock app has ever looked
09:55:22 <Resynth[m]> But it's representative of that
09:55:55 <Resynth[m]> It's the best image I can find
09:55:57 <strcat[m]> which app are you talking about where you can't see the permissions settings
09:56:09 <strcat[m]> you need to give details of exactly what you do that goes wrong and how it goes wrong
09:56:15 <Resynth[m]> Nextcloud, but it happens on any app
09:56:27 <strcat[m]> so you can't enter the permissions settings for any app?
09:56:43 <Resynth[m]> Yep
09:56:58 <strcat[m]> see, here's what's strange, you have problems like this that only happen for you - no one else has reported any of these things
09:57:07 <strcat[m]> I seriously wonder whether you are running GrapheneOS at all
09:57:07 <webb[m]> strcat I don't think it's unreasonable for the average user to correlate an update, and issues like Resynth and I listed happening right after with the update. We're not out to  get anyone here, we're just end user experiencing problems.
09:57:17 <Resynth[m]> What?
09:57:21 <strcat[m]> Resynth regularly comes here to make dubious claims
09:57:28 <strcat[m]> and does not provide specific information
09:57:38 <Resynth[m]> I just did
09:57:39 <strcat[m]> and there are no issues opened on the tracker about these things
09:57:58 <Resynth[m]> I don't know what your problem is, I'm listing factual information
09:58:18 <strcat[m]> no, you already admitted that you weren't
09:58:37 <strcat[m]> so now next thing on your list, what do you mean that you can't check storage without a crash
09:58:43 <strcat[m]> no issue filed for this either
09:58:46 <strcat[m]> what do you mean by checking storage?
09:58:47 <Resynth[m]> In the settings
09:58:53 <strcat[m]> what settings
09:58:59 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "no issue filed for this either"> Yes, nobody has reported it
09:59:13 <Resynth[m]> You are discounting my experience as 'hardware failures' which irks me
09:59:15 <strcat[m]> no one has reported any issues with permissions controls either
09:59:21 <strcat[m]> Resynth: that's not discounting it
09:59:37 <strcat[m]> hardware has a 1-2% failure rate
09:59:48 <strcat[m]> it should be expected that 1-2 out of 100 people have failing hardware
09:59:54 <strcat[m]> including issues like failing flash storage
09:59:57 <strcat[m]> where data corruption occurs
10:00:07 <strcat[m]> and data is now inaccessible so OS components and apps crash
10:00:12 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "including issues like failing fl"> Dude, this happened right after the update
10:00:23 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean it has anything to do with an update
10:00:32 <Resynth[m]> Plus the storage works fine
10:00:40 <strcat[m]> a full update (not delta) writes 2GB to storage
10:00:52 <Resynth[m]> I've already explained the issue, it's the storage section in the settings app
10:00:56 <strcat[m]> if there's a time when storage is going to fail it's after writing 2GB to it
10:01:01 <strcat[m]> Resynth: no, you haven't explained
10:01:15 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "a full update (not delta) writes"> My phone is currently writing a 30GB series to the storage
10:01:29 <strcat[m]> Resynth: you haven't explained what you do to trigger the issue and haven't probably anything like logs
10:01:38 <Resynth[m]> WHAT
10:01:44 <strcat[m]> my impression of your complaints is the SSD in the phone has failed and is returning corrupt data
10:01:45 <Resynth[m]> I just explained it
10:01:48 <strcat[m]> no
10:01:49 <strcat[m]> you didn't
10:02:29 <strcat[m]> you give vague references to what is wrong but not details
10:02:48 <Resynth[m]> Ay dios mio!
10:02:53 <strcat[m]> 1 issue at a time, give details on what is wrong and logs of crashes if crashes occur
10:03:12 <strcat[m]> you installed the OS via fastboot so you are capable of getting logs
10:03:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Finally somebody sensible is here lol
10:03:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) for getting it straight
10:03:45 <Resynth[m]> Correct
10:04:11 <strcat[m]> run `adb logcat -c`
10:04:13 <strcat[m]> trigger the issue
10:04:18 <strcat[m]> run `adb logcat -d`
10:04:23 <strcat[m]> provide the logs
10:04:28 <strcat[m]> 1 issue at a time
10:04:34 <strcat[m]> provide a clear explanation of the issue and logs
10:05:03 <Resynth[m]> I recorded logs as requested by the person above
10:05:03 <strcat[m]> a clear explanation means you say open Settings, open Storage menu
10:05:05 <strcat[m]> or whatever
10:05:08 <Resynth[m]> Which I have provided you with
10:05:11 <strcat[m]> exactly what you do that triggers it
10:05:13 <strcat[m]> and what happens
10:05:20 <strcat[m]> Resynth: 1 issue at a time, provide logs as I explained
10:05:22 <Resynth[m]> In direct messages, which you have just been invited to view in a private setting
10:05:26 <strcat[m]> and a clear explanation of the issue, paired together
10:05:32 <strcat[m]> that's not what you have provided
10:05:37 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "Resynth: 1 issue at a time, prov"> I just did, as explained above
10:05:44 <strcat[m]> no you didn't
10:05:49 <Resynth[m]> I have provided you with the logs
10:05:51 <strcat[m]> you gave me an unexplained bug report zip
10:06:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) send that to me
10:06:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll have a look
10:06:48 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "you gave me an unexplained bug r"> ? I explained it above.
10:06:56 <Resynth[m]> Dude just stop. I've sent you the bug report
10:07:00 <renlord> the bug report is only part of the story
10:07:05 <Resynth[m]> Whether you review this issue is of your own volition
10:07:11 <renlord> you also need to explain what led to the app crashing
10:07:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) just send me that report I'll have a look
10:07:28 <strcat[m]> I explained the process that has to be done
10:07:36 <strcat[m]> run `adb logcat -c`, trigger the issue, run `adb logcat -d` and provide those logs and a clear explanation of what you did to trigger it and what happened
10:07:41 <strcat[m]> one issue at a time
10:07:42 <Resynth[m]> I would suggest not trying to discount my claims by questioning whether or not I'm running GrapheneOS
10:08:14 <strcat[m]> you're acting in a way that makes it seem like you are just trolling
10:08:15 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "you also need to explain what le"> I did, in the bug report
10:08:30 <Resynth[m]> Wow
10:08:43 <webb[m]> <Resynth[m] "I would suggest not trying to di"> And saying I'm just blaming hardware issues on updates when neither of us knows the problem
10:08:55 <strcat[m]> Resynth: you need to provide logs as I explained, not a modified bug report zip
10:09:04 <Resynth[m]> As provided to strcat above, the description of the bug is as follows:
10:09:04 <Resynth[m]> > Hold down an application icon on the home screen, navigate to its settings, then enter the permissions view. This immediately crashes the device. Furthermore, on this round it seems to have fully crashed the System UI process, turning off the phone screen and locking me out of it altogether.
10:09:12 <strcat[m]> run `adb logcat -c`, trigger the issue, run `adb logcat -d` and provide those logs and a clear explanation of what you did to trigger it and what happened
10:09:13 <strcat[m]> provide logs
10:09:14 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "Resynth: you need to provide log"> I have redacted personal information
10:09:17 <strcat[m]> you didn't provide logs
10:09:28 <Resynth[m]> I JUST SENT THEM IN DM
10:09:29 <strcat[m]> okay well you haven't provided anything usable, please do what I said above
10:09:29 <anupritaisno1> Resynth you ARE a troll
10:09:32 <strcat[m]> no, you didn't
10:09:34 <Resynth[m]> ?
10:09:41 <strcat[m]> run `adb logcat -c`, trigger the issue, run `adb logcat -d` and provide those logs and a clear explanation of what you did to trigger it and what happened
10:10:06 <anupritaisno1> If you need proof you've pressed the ignore button for a developer and are calling developers a scam
10:10:17 <Resynth[m]> So, you asked me to use the Android bug reporting facilities, but the bug report is now useless
10:10:17 <anupritaisno1> Need I show you the chat log?
10:10:45 <Resynth[m]> <anupritaisno1 "If you need proof you've pressed"> Please stop circumventing my ignore, I don't want to talk to you. Please don't bring personal issues here
10:10:46 <strcat[m]> Resynth: I didn't ask you to do that - someone else probably did
10:10:55 <strcat[m]> I asked you for logcat logs, you could obtain them in 30 seconds
10:10:56 <renlord> I asked the user to use the bug report feature
10:10:56 <Resynth[m]> I'd like to talk to them
10:11:02 <Resynth[m]> renlord: hi
10:11:09 <renlord> the user indicated to me tthat they dont want to have to use adb at all
10:11:10 <anupritaisno1> Resynth you were supposed to send logs to me
10:11:30 <Resynth[m]> If it's alright, I'd rather talk to renlord about this
10:11:31 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "the user indicated to me tthat t"> You asked me to report a bug in Android
10:11:32 <anupritaisno1> And why?
10:11:32 <Resynth[m]> I am really confused
10:11:34 <renlord> otherwise, i would've suggested strcat[m]'s approach instead, it is simpler and more straight-forward
10:11:40 <anupritaisno1> Why can you not tlk to strcat or me?
10:11:42 <Resynth[m]> I followed your instructions
10:11:44 <anupritaisno1> Huh?
10:11:56 <strcat[m]> run `adb logcat -c`, trigger the issue, run `adb logcat -d` and provide those logs and a clear explanation of what you did to trigger it and what happened
10:12:03 <strcat[m]> if you don't understand how to use `adb`, ask
10:12:55 <anupritaisno2> Basically Resynth you have no desire to get help you are just here to rant
10:13:17 <anupritaisno2> The fact that you ask developers to not circumvent your ban and ask you for the issue is clear evidence
10:13:18 <strcat[m]> webb: if you have an issue to report, do the same
10:13:44 <Resynth[m]> <anupritaisno2 "Basically Resynth you have no de"> Can you please stop bringing personal issues into the chat? I have repeatedly asked you cease contact with me, yet you continue to circumvent this. I'll ask you again: can you please stop contacting me. Please?
10:13:53 <anupritaisno2> There is no personal issue
10:13:56 <Resynth[m]> This experience is appalling
10:14:06 <webb[m]> <strcat[m] "webb: if you have an issue to re"> I was told I couldn't get help for issues that can't be easily reproduced, I provided a list of problems as you requested
10:14:08 <anupritaisno2> Over the last 5 pages numerous developers have asked you to provide logs
10:14:11 <anupritaisno2> So please
10:14:14 <anupritaisno2> Provide them
10:14:43 <webb[m]> I don't know how to report issues when they're general issues like app unloading and performance issues and random lock ups
10:15:03 <strcat[m]> webb: you just said it's slow and has lockups / app crashes which is very unspecific
10:15:24 <Resynth[m]> I have sent the bug report to renlord, as instructed 🤷
10:15:30 <anupritaisnoone> Well why
10:15:30 <strcat[m]> it's modified
10:15:37 <anupritaisnoone> He says he did not get it
10:15:43 <strcat[m]> Resynth: please provide logs as I requested for each crash that is reproducible
10:15:49 <Resynth[m]> I only redacted personal information
10:15:54 <Resynth[m]> As explained above
10:15:58 <Resynth[m]> Sure
10:16:01 <strcat[m]> I didn't ask for a bug report zip
10:16:07 <Resynth[m]> <Resynth[m] "As explained above"> Numerous times. *Sigh...*
10:16:19 <anupritaisnoone> Resynth are you telling me you redacted personal information from a 30mb logfile in a couple minutes?
10:16:25 <strcat[m]> I just want the couple dozen lines of logs for each crash
10:16:44 <Resynth[m]> <anupritaisnoone "Resynth are you telling me you r"> renlord can you please stop this person from contacting me?
10:17:22 <Resynth[m]> He is using various alternate accounts to circumvent my wishes, it's tiring. If he really is a developer of GrapheneOS, then that is cause for concern

10:19:25 <webb[m]> And these all starting happening after the update that shipped with Android 11

10:22:38 <strcat[m]> for each crash, `adb logcat -c`, triggers it, `adb logcat -d`, and provide that with clear instructions on how you triggered it and what happens
10:22:38 <strcat[m]> that's all
10:22:45 <strcat[m]> you don't need to make a bug report zip and modify it
10:28:13 <webb[m]> <strcat[m] "I don't think it's connected to "> I think it might be. Not sure though. I might try downgrading once I have access to a PC and seeing if that helps.
10:29:21 <webb[m]> I'll report any results once I do that
10:32:10 <Resynth[m]> <webb[m] "I think it might be. Not sure th"> Downgrading requires a full wipe btw
10:32:34 <Resynth[m]> I'll do the bug report and perform a full backup actually
10:32:50 <strcat[m]> it would require a full wipe even if there wasn't a check preventing it anyway
10:33:03 <strcat[m]> you can't use Android 11 data with Android 10
10:33:08 <webb[m]> That's fine
10:33:10 <Resynth[m]> Hmm
10:33:14 <strcat[m]> (and the same goes for more minor upgrades)
10:33:14 <Resynth[m]> Agreed
10:33:43 <webb[m]> The potential gain of ruling out what the issue is far outweighs the cost
10:33:56 <webb[m]> At least for me
10:35:02 <Resynth[m]> webb make sure you disable auto-updates if you're going to do that
10:35:07 <Resynth[m]> GrapheneOS has a module for it
10:35:13 <webb[m]> Yeah
10:35:37 <Resynth[m]> You could just block the update server at the DNS level
10:36:15 <strcat[m]> don't know why you are talking about something like that
10:36:24 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-disabling
10:36:34 <strcat[m]> there is official documentation on how to disable updates
10:36:41 <Resynth[m]> Would it not work?
10:37:08 <renlord[m]> Resynth: can you collect some logs from adb logcat, there are some crucial error messages missing from the logs you've sent through
10:38:24 <casd> Is there more phones than the 4 and 4XL that has prebuilt kernels provided?
10:38:33 <Resynth[m]> Would disabling 'Seamless Update Client' work?
10:38:34 <strcat[m]> no
10:38:43 <strcat[m]> casd: no
10:38:44 <strcat[m]> Resynth: https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates-disabling
10:39:09 <Resynth[m]> Sure
10:39:09 <casd> thanks
10:39:26 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "https://grapheneos.org/usage#upd"> Ahh, so I was right. Brilliant
10:40:49 <res4[m]> Resynth: You just deleted a message where you advised them to to block it at DNS level. That's what caused some confusion, because it's not exactly necessary.
10:41:15 <Resynth[m]> I did see it, thanks
10:41:48 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "run `adb logcat -c`, trigger the"> Hoist
10:42:10 <Resynth[m]> No, that was deleted by strcat
10:43:57 <strcat[m]> need adb logcat output to confirm but what I see in your logs is Nextcloud failing to handle network connectivity issues properly (unrelated to the OS)
10:44:08 <strcat[m]> and Settings has a crash from what appears to be a bug detected by hardened_malloc
10:44:25 <strcat[m]> with the `WRITE_AFTER_FREE_CHECK` feature
10:44:53 <strcat[m]> it detects a write after free (probably, need logs to confirm) and aborts
10:45:20 <strcat[m]> but what causes that to happen for you and not others is the question
10:46:49 <strcat[m]> basically the freed memory is zeroed on free, and should still be zeroed when it comes out of the quarantine and is going to be used again, but there is non-zero data there
10:47:07 <Resynth[m]> I'll provide the logs, but I am still going to redact PII
10:47:14 <strcat[m]> so either something wrote to it incorrectly or the memory stopped being zeroed
10:47:17 <strcat[m]> Resynth: that's why I am suggesting
10:47:22 <strcat[m]> `adb logcat -c` (clear log)
10:47:24 <strcat[m]> reproduce the issue
10:47:31 <strcat[m]> then `adb logcat -d > log.txt`
10:47:34 <Resynth[m]>  * I'll provide the logs, but I am still going to redact PII (file names leak a lot)
10:47:45 <Resynth[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's just MediaProvider noise anyway
10:47:53 <strcat[m]> and then I don't need to sift through tons and tons of information that's unrelated
10:48:40 <strcat[m]> if there is a section of your DDR failing
10:49:23 <strcat[m]>  * if there is a section of your DDR memory failing
10:49:56 <Resynth[m]> I know use after free has been the cause of lots of Chromium bugs
10:50:26 <strcat[m]>  * if there is a section of your DDR memory failing that is another possibility and would explain why it's specific to you
10:50:43 <strcat[m]> so basically, when memory allocations are freed
10:51:12 <Resynth[m]> <del>I heavily doubt that
10:51:14 <strcat[m]> hardened_malloc zeroes them and then does something atypical for a memory allocator: it tries to delay reusing that memory as long as possible since it might get written to again from a use-after-free bug
10:51:37 <strcat[m]> so the memory is sitting there, unused, zeroed, for potentially quite a long time
10:52:13 <strcat[m]> the OS may decide to swap it out into the compressed ramdisk swap
10:52:28 <Resynth[m]> It could happen, but ehh
10:52:29 <Resynth[m]> Honestly the only time this has happened is after this update
10:52:29 <Resynth[m]> If there's any way to test hardware tho
10:52:38 <strcat[m]> and then when it runs out of quarantine and finally has to use the memory again
10:52:54 <strcat[m]> it checks to make sure it is still zeroed to detect write-after-free bugs
10:52:59 <strcat[m]> that's the error that appears to be happening
10:53:04 <strcat[m]> a write after free is detected
10:53:04 <lpcvoid[m]1> That was interesting to read, strcat, thanks
10:53:18 <renlord[m]> Resynth:  a memory integrity check lol
10:53:23 <strcat[m]> i.e. memory it zeroed, that is supposed to be unused
10:53:26 <strcat[m]> is not zeroed
10:53:28 <strcat[m]> anymore
10:53:38 <strcat[m]> after some time
10:53:46 <strcat[m]> so typically this would be from a software use-after-free bug - but that's not the only possibility
10:54:14 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "so typically this would be from "> Hmm
10:54:32 <Resynth[m]> <renlord[m] "Resynth:  a memory integrity che"> An app tho
10:54:34 <renlord[m]> Resynth: sounds like its time for an upgrade
10:54:35 <renlord[m]> :(
10:54:43 <renlord[m]> Resynth: no app can do it on android
10:54:46 <strcat[m]> Resynth: I could improve hardened_malloc error messages
10:54:49 <strcat[m]> for the next release
10:54:56 <strcat[m]> it doesn't give details atm
10:55:00 <Resynth[m]> <renlord[m] "Resynth: no app can do it on and"> ...wut
10:55:10 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "Resynth: I could improve hardene"> That would be cool
10:55:11 <highfiv3r> hi, do I need to upgrade to Android 11 before installing Grapheneos
10:55:19 <renlord[m]> no userspace applicaiton have that level of privileges
10:55:20 <renlord[m]>  * no userspace applicaiton have that level of privilege
10:55:24 <Resynth[m]> It would also be very nice if hardened_malloc worked on Fedora :-)
10:55:34 <strcat[m]> highfiv3r: no but we recommend upgrading to the latest release first just to make sure you have all the available bug fixes for firmware
10:55:35 <res4[m]> <highfiv3r "hi, do I need to upgrade to Andr"> It's recommended.
10:55:40 <strcat[m]> highfiv3r: GrapheneOS has the latest firmware
10:56:00 <strcat[m]> but we recommend updating first just so that you have all the bug fixes that might be relevant to flashing GrapheneOS
10:56:11 <strcat[m]> it's not mandatory, probably not going to be an issue if you don't
10:56:26 <highfiv3r> strcat[m] thanks
10:56:32 <strcat[m]> there are occasionally improvements to fastboot flashing reliability etc.
10:56:32 <strcat[m]> that's why
10:56:50 <strcat[m]> fastboot heavily depends on having a proper USB connection that's reliable anyway
10:57:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only thing is please update from the system settings or an OTA update
10:57:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't flash a fastboot update to R, that's just redundant
10:57:06 <strcat[m]> most people who experience issues with flashing have a defective cable, USB hub, USB port, USB controller, etc.
10:57:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "most people who experience issue"> I've seen people who've installed 10+ unrelated adb drivers
10:57:59 <renlord[m]> yawns
10:58:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or one whose windows install couldn't extract a zip
10:58:32 <strcat[m]> Resynth: can you reboot and then trigger the Settings bug again and provide another log
10:58:34 <renlord> Resynth[m]: why not just upgrade your phone? the pixel 2 is EOL
10:59:22 <strcat[m]> Resynth: nevermind don't need it
10:59:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord "Resynth: why not just upgrade yo"> Oh noes you said the u word you gonna be killed by environmentalists
10:59:41 <Resynth[m]> <renlord "Resynth: why not just upgrade yo"> Honestly while I can appreciate that, this thing ran lovely on Android 10. I'll probably re-flash GrapheneOS Android 10 onto it and see if it's stable. If not, it's a hardware thing, sure
10:59:49 <renlord[m]> e-waste? man, everyone's time is precious too
10:59:59 <strcat[m]> the Settings issue is probably data corruption on storage of some kind
11:00:06 <strcat[m]> that's triggering a use-after-free
11:00:08 <Resynth[m]> Hmm
11:00:37 <strcat[m]> try clearing Settings app data
11:00:41 <Resynth[m]> <renlord[m] "e-waste? man, everyone's time is"> Yes, why throw out a working phone
11:00:44 <strcat[m]> (shouldn't actually wipe many settings at all)
11:00:55 <Resynth[m]> Sure
11:01:11 <renlord[m]> > Yes, why throw out a working phone
11:01:11 <renlord[m]> i wouldn't call a phone that stops receiving security patches a working phone
11:01:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Resynth[m] "Yes, why throw out a working pho"> renlord told you
11:01:16 <Resynth[m]> Fuck it's crashed
11:01:50 <strcat[m]> clearing data crashed?
11:01:56 <Resynth[m]> Ofc now I'm running logcat it works fine
11:01:59 <Resynth[m]> Uhh
11:02:04 <Resynth[m]> Getting into the apps screen crashed
11:02:19 <Resynth[m]> I am trying to clear it
11:02:25 <strcat[m]> btw are you using a theme or anything weird
11:02:34 <Resynth[m]> Nope
11:02:38 <Resynth[m]> This is stock GrOS
11:02:41 <renlord[m]> weird launcher skin? kek
11:02:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> [renlord](https://matrix.to/#/@renlord:matrix.org) could be font too
11:03:12 <strcat[m]> it would be good to improve the hardened_malloc error reporting on Android
11:03:31 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use logcat right now like my old code used to do (since it's not part of bionic, it's a separate library like jemalloc)
11:04:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "it doesn't use logcat right now "> Pm
11:07:21 <Resynth[m]> Clearing data doesn't do shit, sadly
11:09:23 <Resynth[m]> What's the last GrapheneOS version without Android 11?
11:11:30 <webb[m]> 2020.09.11.14 I believe
11:11:38 <Resynth[m]> I'll go two or three behind just to be safe
11:13:34 <Resynth[m]> 2020.08.07.01 looks good
11:13:43 <Resynth[m]> webb: the next version has the Android 11 kernel
11:14:08 <Resynth[m]> I feel so naughty 😳
11:16:07 <webb[m]> Also mad respect for using a Pixel 2
11:16:09 <Resynth[m]> :D
11:16:24 <Resynth[m]> It's actually really solid, nearly four years later. Wow.
11:16:48 <strcat[m]> other than the issues you have at least
11:16:59 <strcat[m]> but haven't heard other people on Pixel 2 report those
11:17:14 <Resynth[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.11.14 hmm
11:17:14 <Resynth[m]> I see you
11:17:34 <Resynth[m]> No idea how to install a "platform manifest" though, should I self-compile Android?
11:17:43 <webb[m]> I heard they're still very good phones
11:17:48 <marlow11[m]> I've noticed slowdown on file access. Well both ghost commander and galleries slow to a crawl in any directory that has many files.
11:18:07 <strcat[m]> marlow11: on which device
11:18:14 <marlow11[m]> Other than that no issues on pixel 2
11:18:33 <strcat[m]> 2 and 2 XL are fairly different
11:18:35 <Resynth[m]> Definitely
11:18:39 <strcat[m]> they were made by different manufacturers
11:18:54 <strcat[m]> they made two versions of the 2 XL
11:18:56 <strcat[m]> and cancelled one
11:19:04 <marlow11[m]> Oh you were talking about 2 xl... My bad
11:19:07 <strcat[m]> the cancelled one was a bigger version of the Pixel 2
11:19:23 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 2 XL that came out is much different than the 2
11:19:27 <strcat[m]> marlow11: I'm not sure just clarifying
11:19:31 <strcat[m]> that unlike all the later generations
11:19:36 <strcat[m]> the XL version is a lot different
11:19:57 <strcat[m]> Pixel 1 and Pixel 1 XL are variants of the same device (different touchscreen, battery, etc.)
11:20:02 <strcat[m]> 2 and 2 XL are much different
11:20:06 <strcat[m]> others are like the 1 and 1 XL
11:20:10 <webb[m]> Weird my message is glitching out
11:20:30 <Resynth[m]> strcat any instructions on self-compilation?
11:20:36 <webb[m]> I had said "mad respects for using a Pixel 2 XL" for context
11:20:39 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build
11:20:47 <Resynth[m]> Thankie
11:46:21 <strcat[m]> Resynth: I could make a beta taimen release with the new logcat changes
11:46:28 <strcat[m]> but it won't really accomplish much other than confirming what's wrong
11:55:45 <aurorab> Hi I took a screenshot on my owner profile that appeared on my new user tofsy
11:55:54 <aurorab> Today*
11:56:05 <aurorab> This seems like quite the breach.
11:57:08 <strcat[m]> what do you mean it appeared there
11:57:32 <strcat[m]>  * what do you mean it appeared there?
11:58:28 <strcat[m]> aurorab: you'll need to explain what you mean
11:59:43 <aurorab> Apologies for lack of context. I attempted to screenshot a sign conversation on my owner profile. It appeared to not work but upon going to my second user profile it was in the gallery app
12:00:26 <aurorab> Looking now it appears there is plenty of crossover on both sides although not every time
12:00:41 <strcat[m]> Signal has a setting to disable screenshots, if that's what you mean
12:01:39 <aurorab> The screenshots are being taken. But appearing on my secondary profile.
12:02:13 <strcat[m]> are you talking about user profiles?
12:02:19 <strcat[m]> or the work profile
12:02:27 <aurorab> User profiles*
12:03:14 <aurorab> Perhaps this is a feature although it seems counter intuitive for both user profiles to share the same folders. My idea of having multiple user profiles would be to keep certain things separate.
12:03:30 <strcat[m]> they don't share them
12:03:38 <aurorab> Potentially a bug? Or maybe misuse on my part.
12:04:38 <aurorab> OK so thankyou for clarifying that. The issue I am running into is that they are sharing. I don't even have signal installed on my second user profile so its not possible for the screenshots to be there.
12:05:30 <aurorab> Looking now on my "owner" user profile I can see that there are screenshots from the Facebook messenger app which is only installed on my secondary user profile
12:08:56 <strcat[m]> looks like a caching issue in Android 11 for the screenshot service, if you're taking them back to back in one profile and then another
12:09:25 <strcat[m]> don't know exactly
12:09:51 <strcat[m]> Android 11 has a new screenshot service / notification workflow
12:10:01 <strcat[m]> we don't make any changes to those kinds of things
12:10:14 <aurorab> I'm new to the grapheneos community although ive been using it as an operating system for a year. Is there anywhere I should make not of this?
12:10:28 <strcat[m]> the Android bug tracker
12:10:46 <strcat[m]> https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/report-bugs
12:11:15 <aurorab> OK thank you for your time.
12:11:40 <aurorab> I will try a clean install as well. Its quite a serious bug in terms of my workflow.
12:12:07 <strcat[m]> I don't think you need to do that
12:12:11 <strcat[m]> it won't change anything
12:12:37 <strcat[m]> as I said there seems to be a caching issue when you take back to back screenshots across different profiles
12:12:52 <strcat[m]> if it is currently in the process of handling screenshots for a profile, it will send the other ones to that profile
12:13:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay 4a testers who have messaged me
12:13:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please message me again and I'll link you to the builds
12:13:11 <strcat[m]> there's a new screenshot implementation in Android 11 and this appears to be an issue with it
12:13:24 <strcat[m]> needs to be reported on the Android issue tracker with clear reproducible instructions
12:13:25 <aurorab> OK. Understood.
12:13:59 <strcat[m]> the issue is that the SystemUI screenshot service is sending them to the same profile it was sending the others
12:14:07 <strcat[m]> it's not an issue with profiles themselves
12:14:12 <strcat[m]> it's a SystemUI bug
12:14:20 <aurorab> I actually had one more question but wasn't sure where to begin
12:14:55 <strcat[m]> possible we can just change the configuration to use a more legacy form of screenshot handling
12:14:59 <strcat[m]> until this is fully baked
12:15:25 <aurorab> I'll be interested to see if you hear more reports of this
12:15:29 <aurorab> Hope its okay that I ask here although apologies if it is not entirely appropriate. I would like certain features within grspheneos
12:16:19 <aurorab> I don't have a background in coding or time in my current lifestyle to learn. I'm willing to pay for these features to be coded but wasn't sure if grapheneos operstes in this way at all
12:17:24 <aurorab> I figured it may be OK as it helps direct and fun continuation of the project even if its in a more direct way
12:17:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aurorab "I don't have a background in cod"> aurorab no it doesn't
12:18:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can donate to [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) but donation isn't a guarantee of how long it will take to implement something
12:19:49 <aurorab> Sure thing. Thank you for explaining further. In my country we have very limited privacy laws and would be interested in seeing self destruct features. I feel that it is something that may be implemented in time if the project is supported.
12:25:01 <elmyder[m]> out of curiosity what exactly do you mean by self destruct features?
12:25:21 <strcat[m]> aurorab: please look through our issue tracker
12:25:23 <strcat[m]> for what's already filed
12:27:07 <aurorab> I don't want to take up more space in chat but by self destruct I mean having the device format when a certain wrong password is entered or even remote formatting. In my country you risk jail time for not providing your phone password.
12:28:36 <strcat[m]> you can use a device manager to remotely factory reset a device but that assumes it is powered on and connected to a network
12:28:40 <strcat[m]> and they could just turn it off
12:28:48 <strcat[m]> until it is in a faraday cage
12:28:52 <strcat[m]> or take out the SIM card
12:29:28 <strcat[m]> aurorab: there is an issue filed about supporting a 'duress' password but the details of the design are not figured out, and no one has expressed interest in working out those details let alone beginning to implement it
12:29:36 <strcat[m]> aurorab: so I wouldn't expect an implementation any time soon
12:29:42 <strcat[m]> aurorab: look through the issues in our tracker
12:29:52 <aurorab> Doing so now.
12:29:52 <strcat[m]> most are 'enhancement' issues tracking planned enhancements
12:29:58 <doobry[m]> probably aurorab means something like the LUKS nuke password patch by kali linux: https://www.kali.org/tutorials/nuke-kali-linux-luks/
12:30:26 <strcat[m]> please refer to the existing issue about it
12:34:36 <strcat[m]> aurorab: I filed an upstream issue for the screenshot issue along with one on our tracker to follow the upstream issue
12:34:40 <strcat[m]> so you don't need to file it
12:34:51 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/370
12:35:28 <aurorab> I saw that and appreciate it. If you have time could you take a second to point me in the direction of remote wipe through device manager. Not finding much detailed in settings.
12:36:34 <strcat[m]> aurorab: you'd need to install a device manager app providing that feature and grant it the ability to wipe the device
12:36:49 <strcat[m]> aurorab: I don't have a suggestion for an app - I don't know if there are any sane / decent ones available
12:37:23 <aurorab> OK no problem, I'll take some time over the coming weekend to look into it.
12:37:25 <strcat[m]> they'd also have to support Direct Boot to be able to run before login
12:38:39 <strcat[m]> an app can be made 'direct boot aware' and can explicitly store things in the profile's device encrypted storage to have it available before login (rather than requiring an initial login to make credential encrypted storage available)
12:38:46 <strcat[m]> extremely few apps support this for anything
12:39:28 <strcat[m]> an example where it's pretty much mandatory is a keyboard that aims to be a full replacement of the OS keyboard, otherwise it couldn't be used for entering your passphrase initially
12:41:09 <aurorab> I question if such a specific app would exist outside of what google already provides on regular android devices.
12:41:12 <strcat[m]> before per-profile encryption and device-encrypted storage was supported (via filesystem-based encryption's fine-grained key support), enabling accessibility services used to disable credential-based encryption, now that's no longer a thing since it's up to them to go out of the way to be direct boot aware and store data they need before login in device encrypted storage
12:41:19 <strcat[m]> aurorab: yes, they do exist
12:41:26 <strcat[m]> aurorab: Google's device manager is far from the only one
12:41:39 <aurorab> I see android device manager does so as well.
12:42:29 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean by that
12:42:49 <strcat[m]> Android itself has support for app-based device managers, Google offers an app-based device manager that's included with Play services, but there are many others
12:43:14 <strcat[m]> Android without Play services is still a regular Android device
12:43:41 <strcat[m]> there are devices certified as Android devices by Google without Play services
12:44:05 <strcat[m]> Play services and Google apps are not part of baseline Android
12:44:28 <strcat[m]> they are something that can optionally be included by the vendor for a certified Android device
12:44:42 <aurorab> Of course. Perhaps just confusion on my part.
12:44:57 <strcat[m]> most devices in China don't have Play services or Google apps but many are still official Android certified devices
12:45:04 <strcat[m]> among others
12:45:45 <aurorab> I had just noticed that play service enabled devices seemed go contain remote wipe features and then so did most other base android systems using a different app based device manager.
12:45:57 <aurorab> To*
12:46:15 <aurorab> Different than the google provided one*
12:46:43 <aurorab> Anyways, I should sleep now but I've greatly appreciated your insight. Thankyou.
13:20:26 <pjvleeuwen[m]> I consider buying a certain printer. The manufacturer of that printer also provides an Android app. I need to give this app network access to allow it to send a job to the printer. But I'd rather block it from accessing the internet. The privacy policy of this Android app states "_When you prepare to print certain types of files through the software, such files will be automatically sent to our server, converted
13:20:26 <pjvleeuwen[m]> into printable format files, and then sent back to your devices_". Based on this policy it is unclear what is included in "_certain types_"... I'd like to be able to print a document from my mobile without sharing it over the internet, so I am considering this before buying this certain printer. I am considering upgrading my LAN with a firewall, but it is difficult to make this Android-app-specific or use whitelist
13:20:26 <pjvleeuwen[m]> approach. I am considering an Android device local firewall, but based on comments on iptable or VPN based solutions I am not sure if this is a good approach. So my general question is: what would you recommend me?
13:24:35 <strcat[m]> AFAIK there's built-in support for devices following printing standards
13:24:36 <strcat[m]> no need for an app
13:24:44 <strcat[m]> but I haven't used a printer in ages and not from my phone
13:27:24 <pjvleeuwen[m]> So it might be that I can print without this app, maybe only needing this app for additional device or manufacturer specific functionality. I will try to find such standards / ask the manufacturer if I might also be able to print without using their app... Thank you for your reply.
13:54:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) there's a print service afaik
13:54:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically you must install an app from the printer provider
13:54:43 <pjvleeuwen[m]> Apparently my considered printer is certified by the Mopria Alliance ( https://mopria.org/certified-products ). This should mean it should print with the "Default Print Service" shipped with Android. For scanning documents with this all-in-one printer I might still have to use an app from the manufacturer.
13:54:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> And you can select the app is the printing provider
13:55:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> * And you can select the app as the printing provider
13:58:17 <strcat[m]> there's a default IPP-based print service
13:59:37 <pjvleeuwen[m]> <strcat[m] "there's a default IPP-based prin"> Is this the same as the "Default Print Service" we find under Settings?
14:00:43 <strcat[m]> yes
16:08:36 <seashield[m]> ?
16:46:14 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "but it won't really accomplish m"> True
16:50:10 <Resynth[m]> Honestly I think I'm just gonna roll my own GrOS builds
16:50:21 <Resynth[m]> Would be fun to learn + I have more control
16:50:34 <makingaliasesisa> nice
16:53:26 <webweb> hi, how can i extract apks on grapheneos?
16:57:27 <spongebobba[m]> Hi
16:57:27 <spongebobba[m]> When i want to put the ./flash-all.sh command it says "fastboot too old".
16:57:27 <spongebobba[m]> Apparently i have the newest version installed through android studio.
16:57:37 <spongebobba[m]> What can i do?
16:58:27 <lpcvoid[m]1> You need to uninstall the version that came in your distros package management and make sure newer fastboot is in your path
16:59:16 <spongebobba[m]> Ok i try it
17:47:35 <kiyaaaa[m]> Anybody had a spare Pixel on stock?
17:48:41 <kiyaaaa[m]> Need help on testing an app if it breaks by no Play services or just broken in secondary user profiles
17:50:07 <kiyaaaa[m]> * Need help on testing an app if it breaks by no Play services in secondary user profiles or just broken in secondary user profiles in general

19:52:29 <kiyaaaabai[m]> Bruh
19:53:07 <kiyaaaabai[m]> Felt like doing cringe while throwing shade at a supposedly "better than Google" company but nah
19:54:40 <Copperheadrules[> <louipc "grapheneos of course"> seashield: anupritaisno1 Hey! Be polite! Answer the goddamn question!!!
19:55:21 <louipc> relax
20:00:03 <louipc> discussion of other OS should at minimum be redirected to #grapheneos-offtopic thanks
20:09:30 <r0ckl0bst3r[m]> Does graphene support active edge on the pixel 4?
20:09:45 <Copperheadrules[> louipc: pointless comment. I should report you to the room moderator! I'm gonna leave the room if people can't answer my question! No point being here. Last chance.
20:12:34 <louipc> right. Last chance. You're welcome to leave.
20:12:40 <seashield[m]> Wow...
20:13:44 <Copperheadrules[> louipc Have you just made yourself a moderator?
20:14:15 <Copperheadrules[> That's probably illegal
20:14:24 <louipc> no the trustworthy robot did
20:14:58 <Copperheadrules[> How does that happen? I need to be made the moderator too.
20:15:53 <louipc> thats a topic for #graphene-offtopic.
20:16:57 <Copperheadrules[> Keep up! I'm talking about being made a moderator.
20:17:12 <louipc> ok bye

20:23:52 <louipc> yea i can see it on matrix side
20:24:00 <louipc> irc is quiet tho :D
20:24:25 <r0ckl0bst3r[m]> 😂
20:25:32 <Kruzarth[m]> What an annoying Guy
20:26:37 <seashield[m]> Slight unstable troll, me thinks. Right move to ban. Bizarrely satisfying to see him repeatedly try and fail to get back in.
20:30:19 <renlord> louipc: can you do matrix-side bans?
20:30:42 <louipc> not atm
20:37:53 <dallemon[m]> louipc: now he's in the off topic channel
21:00:10 <ragap[m]> Would doing Uber, Lyft, Ubereats, Postmates, etc be possible on GrapheneOS? As a driver, not as a customer. Sorry if that's a n00b question.
21:09:46 <graphenefan> they depend on google maps and GCM for notifications. usually I saw drivers use a cheap phone that always stays in the car for those apps
21:11:19 <graphenefan> or one of those chinese tablets for <100$
21:12:21 <louipc> good idea
21:14:06 <sphinxcat[m]> > GCM
21:14:06 <sphinxcat[m]> FCM*
21:28:57 <ragap[m]> Hm. Thanks for the info.
23:46:26 * M8942w[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tITCSSwDmZUPAOAmbfCYFbDS/message.txt >
23:49:40 <entry1[m]> Can you provide a picture? And did everything else go without issue in powershell? You should only have to put the ./flash-all.bat after moving the factory images in the directory
23:50:36 <M8942w[m]> I can recreate what i did in powershell then copy/past it if that will help
23:51:45 <M8942w[m]> every thing else worked
23:53:28 <esec2[m]> Maybe upgrade fastboot, it's hardly rocket science running a bat file brotherman
23:53:37 <entry1[m]> So you did the curl.exe step for the standalone platform tools in powershell, then set path, enabled OEM locking/USB debugging, unlocked the bootloader, curl.exe the factory image, extract the factory image, cd'd the factory image, and then put "./flash-all.bat
23:54:27 <entry1[m]> "./flash-all.bat"
23:54:57 <entry1[m]> I just did it today and fastboot worked fine
23:55:21 <esec2[m]> Goddamn windows users. I bet devs are pulling their hair out being asked about this
23:56:34 <M8942w[m]> i'm sorry i'll get linex when i get a new com
23:56:38 <esec2[m]> If you're in the shit, headbutting with out of date binaries.. try cygwin, try anything before you ask the devs.
23:57:04 <esec2[m]> #thatfeeling
23:57:10 <graphenefan> why not just get a quick virtualbox vm for that?
23:57:13 <louipcm> wonder if you can flash from WSL
23:57:44 <louipcm> anyways eventually there will be a web install page
23:58:03 <entry1[m]> He's just asking the community not the devs, this should be a simple fix. Its easiest step by step in powershell for windows
23:58:04 <M8942w[m]> fastboot worked fine for everything but flash-all
23:58:49 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "fastboot worked fine for everyth"> Check the script, all paths and make sure they're pointing to the correct binaries
23:59:25 <M8942w[m]> sorry if im slow. im new to all this.
23:59:30 <entry1[m]> Yeah, you didn't skip the $env:Path step did you 8942w
23:59:30 <graphenefan> or if you can't figure the env path settings, just put the latest fastboot.exe in your directory with flash-all and run from there
