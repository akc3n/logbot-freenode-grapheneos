01:11:08 <servo> HELLO ALL MEMEBERS
01:35:53 <Dylanger[m]> Has anyone applied the microG cert spoofing patch?
01:36:09 <renlord[m]> Dylanger: no
01:36:21 <Dylanger[m]> Also anyone know how the OTA Updater server works? I can't seem to find any doc's on running the server
01:36:42 <Dylanger[m]> <renlord[m] "Dylanger: no"> I've applied them, about to build
02:17:41 <digitalfrontier[> Hello, anyone have a Pixel 4a who has flashed their device with GrapheneOS? If so, how has it been working for you?
02:24:56 <Dylanger[m]> Commits aren't signed ‚òπÔ∏è - only the manifest repo is signed
02:31:28 <renlord[m]> so what if commits are signed, when was the last time people checked commit signatures?
02:32:09 <renlord[m]> or even bothered to verify if commits are correctly signed
02:38:53 <Dylanger[m]> Anyone know how this works? https://github.com/GrapheneOS/releases.grapheneos.org
02:39:43 <Dylanger[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/flame-stable.zip
02:39:43 <Dylanger[m]> ?
02:40:18 <renlord[m]> yea, it works
02:42:09 <renlord[m]> how to set up your private release server is not documented
02:43:03 <renlord[m]> from the script, you can see its assumed that you have a `www-data` user and at the homedir you should have `html_a` and `html_b` and `html (symlink)`
02:50:28 <Dylanger[m]> Ah got it
02:50:29 <Dylanger[m]> https://releases.grapheneos.org/flame-ota_update-2020.10.23.04.zip

02:52:56 <Dylanger[m]> Any idea why running a private release server isn't documented?
02:53:03 <Dylanger[m]> Just not enough interest?
02:53:35 <renlord[m]> if you're going to self-build, you're just going to use it privately for yourself
02:53:57 <renlord[m]> so what's the point of documenting how to setup a private release server?
02:54:51 <Dylanger[m]> <digitalfrontier[ "Hello, anyone have a Pixel 4a wh"> Going to build this now
02:59:55 <digitalfrontier[> Dylanger nice, hopefully it works well for you. I flashed it this morning, just about everything pretty much works like it should. Only issues I have seen were with the default SMS app and F-Droid. Upon launching the Messages app, I got a message which read "this app was built for a previous version of Android..." Same with F-Droid.
03:04:23 <digitalfrontier[> I was able to install apps from F-Droid just fine regardless, but went with Aurora Droid instead which gave me no errors. There was also some weird graphical issue with F-Droid, hard to describe. Between switching to different screens within the app the screen would go black for a beat and then load whatever content needed to be loaded. Almost like a lag for loading content? In any case, I did forget that for
03:04:24 <digitalfrontier[> whatever reason dark mode isn't universally applied. That is to say, to all stock apps. Just the settings related things in GrapheneOS. Other than that pretty happy with it on my Pixel 4a.
03:07:04 <digitalfrontier[> Long story short, no major show stopping bugs on Pixel 4a.
03:20:23 <louipc_> renlord[m]: commit sigs could be useful in court cases :p
03:20:44 <renlord[m]> that itself is a can of worms
03:20:44 <louipc_> maybe
03:20:55 <louipc_> yea lol
03:21:32 <renlord[m]> non-repudiation is often disputed
03:21:42 <renlord[m]> since key management is a dark art
03:25:09 <Dylanger[m]> How is Daniel managing key right now?
03:25:12 <Dylanger[m]> Anyone know?
04:27:59 <Dylanger[m]> Does anyone know where the production builds take place?
04:28:11 <renlord[m]> yes. Daniel's computer
04:28:27 <Dylanger[m]> Ah cool, so not some VPS/server somewhere
04:28:28 <renlord[m]> and then he signs then with his keys
04:28:39 <renlord[m]> of course not a random VPS
04:38:39 <Dylanger[m]> Okay cool
04:38:57 <Dylanger[m]> Does `OFFICIAL_BUILD` do anything else aside from disable/enable updater?
05:16:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Does `OFFICIAL_BUILD` do anythin"> Yes
05:18:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <digitalfrontier[ "I was able to install apps from "> Fdroid is just a very buggy client and is not really recommended

05:20:02 <Dylanger[m]> If `OFFICIAL_BUILD=false` is enabling other debug features I need to know about it
05:21:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just don't set it at all
05:22:57 <digitalfrontier[> anupritaisno1 do you personally use another method to install your apps? Perhaps grabbing the apks straight from the source or a site like APK Mirror?

05:29:21 <Dylanger[m]> Has anyone managed to get an eSIM LPA working on Graphene?
05:29:36 <Dylanger[m]> Guess there aren't any open source LPAs
05:30:12 <null[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Has anyone managed to get an eSI"> IIRC, no
05:33:18 * Dylanger[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DjEIpZJMyXiiKtaPUaKWdsgL/message.txt >
05:33:37 <digitalfrontier[> Ah, Aurora Store is nice. No doubt. I try to rely only on FOSS apps though. The only app I have from Aurora is my banking app and Here We Go maps, no account. Don't @ me! But OSMand is just not good IMO.
05:33:49 <digitalfrontier[> *apps
05:36:15 <joltman[m]> If using OSMand, is one of the biggest problems that you don't have street numbers and there are fewer POIs than in other apps?
05:37:29 <digitalfrontier[> Usability is one thing but yes also just finding places even with the map for my area downloaded.
05:38:25 <digitalfrontier[> Also the limited voice navigation with no TTS installed.
05:40:20 <digitalfrontier[> Minor gripes, sure, but in the end OSMand isn't my cup of tea for navigation.
05:42:34 <joltman[m]> It's been a little difficult trading in Waze, which was my old "go to" for navigation.
05:45:00 <Dylanger[m]> The "Force 90Hz" option is missing on the Pixel 4
05:45:08 <digitalfrontier[> I hear you. A maps app is that one thing that just needs to be a great experience in all aspects. Google Maps is insanely good, Waze too. But we all got away from old Googs for a reason, right? It's just too bad we don't have a FOSS alternative that can match those two apps yet.
05:48:20 <Dylanger[m]> <renlord[m] "so what's the point of documenti"> It's not possible to update via fastboot when the bootloader is locked, so without your own Release Server, you can't re-lock the bootloader with your own fork/version of Graphene
05:48:34 <Dylanger[m]> (YELLOW State)
05:48:59 <renlord[m]> you can relock the bootloader with your own build
05:49:03 <renlord[m]> if you sign with your own custom key
05:49:22 <renlord[m]> all custom keys will yield the yellow state
05:49:26 <renlord[m]> including daniel's
05:49:38 <Dylanger[m]> How do you do updates then?
05:49:42 <Dylanger[m]> Without a release server?
05:49:47 <Dylanger[m]>  * Without a release server/updater app?
05:51:10 <renlord[m]> `adb sideload OTAPACKAGE` ?
05:51:27 <Dylanger[m]> ü§î
05:52:49 <renlord[m]> actually dont use that
05:53:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord[m] "actually dont use that "> That's the correct way
05:53:39 <renlord[m]> i was just unsure if you needed to unlock bootloader or not
05:53:42 <renlord[m]> i've never done it myself
05:53:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "The "Force 90Hz" option is missi"> Yes. We don't ship that weird app
05:54:11 <Dylanger[m]> You know what it's called?
05:54:24 <Dylanger[m]> I'll RE it and see what it's actually doing
05:54:26 <Dylanger[m]> So we can implement it properly
05:54:37 <Dylanger[m]> If screen brightness is low, it'll always stay at 60Hz
05:54:46 <Dylanger[m]> Meaning shitty scrolling of twitter in bed
05:55:16 <renlord[m]> with faster refresh rate, would i enjoy scrolling twitter more?
05:55:21 <renlord[m]> ü§î
05:55:35 <Dylanger[m]> You tried on 90Hz? It's butter smooth
05:55:42 <renlord[m]> no i havent
05:55:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "So we can implement it properly"> We are not implementing it
05:56:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> That app has several dependencies on code not publicly available in AOSP
05:56:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it just repeatedly crashes
05:57:04 <Dylanger[m]> I don't mean add the app, if you give me the name of the app, I can figure out what it's actually doing to force 90Hz

06:16:11 <digitalfrontier[> Nice! The thing that surprises me most is battery life. It was already impressive stock but on GrapheneOS the battery life is bonkers.
06:16:59 <nsgl[m]> Are carrier variants still a concern on `Pixel 4` and subsequent models?
06:17:21 <digitalfrontier[> I don't have many apps aside from the stock apps though. Literally just 11 more.

06:18:59 <joltman[m]> <nsgl[m] "Are carrier variants still a con"> I think that is still a problem...namely Verizon versions.
06:19:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "So `adb sideload` is a go? lol i"> Yes so don't turn off OEM unlocking
06:19:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Turning it off really doesn't give you much security on graphene
06:19:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyone can reset the phone and turn it on again
06:19:45 <Dylanger[m]> Ah right, good point
06:19:59 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah it'll reset if anyone `flashing unlock`'s it
06:20:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> And unlocking the bootloader resets the phone anyway
06:20:32 <Dylanger[m]> Now to test GMS/FCM notifications
06:21:43 <Dylanger[m]> Is ccache dead?
06:21:50 <Dylanger[m]> Wasn't used at all during my build

06:56:38 <renlord[m]> wut, protonmail requires play services?
06:57:45 <somenerd[m]> that'd be ironic

06:59:01 <renlord[m]> very ironic, indeed.
06:59:44 <renlord[m]> i suppose users without play services can use IMAP/SMTP configurations on their MUA
07:00:01 <somenerd[m]> wow
07:00:10 <somenerd[m]> lol wut
07:06:08 <strcat[m]> you should just use a proper IMAP email client with IMAP push
07:06:13 <strcat[m]> IMAP IDLE is push
07:06:22 <digitalfrontier[> Tutanota is good if you need an email service without GSF dependence. They have an app on F-Droid.
07:06:26 <strcat[m]> so a proper email client can do push as long as the server has IMAP IDLE support
07:06:42 <digitalfrontier[> But they are based in Germany which is a 14 eyes country.
07:06:44 <strcat[m]> the only way to use FCM would be if the server supports FCM... how many email servers support FCM anyway?
07:06:53 <strcat[m]> protonmail went out of their way to do push via Google instead of IMAP
07:07:06 <digitalfrontier[> Personally I use Ctemplar. Baser out of Iceland. Also on F-Droid.

07:11:26 <JTL> renlord[m]: hmm?
07:12:13 <prestocaso[m]> Anyone here try the Experimental 4a release?
07:12:36 <digitalfrontier[> Yep. No major issues.
07:14:14 <digitalfrontier[> Only things, Messages complains about being based on a previous version of Android, dark mode doesn't apply to all stock apps, F-Droid will also complain that it's based on a previous version of Android. But as someone else stated F-Droid is just buggy.
07:14:20 <prestocaso[m]> I've got a 4a and would like to try graphene, I've been using calyxos so far, but I like grapene's security a bit more.
07:15:09 <digitalfrontier[> You might want to switch to a different gallery app. I wasn't a fan and apparently others have had bugs crop up on it?
07:15:46 <digitalfrontier[> For SMS I just use Signal as my default app anyway so the Messages issue didn't bother me too much.
07:18:04 <digitalfrontier[> Ah and where CalyxOS is still on Android 10 the GrapheneOS build for the 4a is on Android 11.
07:20:18 <prestocaso[m]> That's one issue yeah, I just chalk that up to calyx being a bit more conservative in their release schedule
07:21:30 <digitalfrontier[> Right. I do find GrapheneOS to be just as smooth as CalyxOS on my 4a. Generally speaking. I was on CalyxOS before too.
07:23:31 <prestocaso[m]> I'd used graphene on a 3a a bit back and loved it, but I got a really good deal to trade in for the 4a
07:24:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> [prestocaso](https://matrix.to/#/@prestocaso:matrix.org) yeah don't
07:24:22 <prestocaso[m]> And I've just been monitoring the scene since
07:24:27 <digitalfrontier[> Pixel 4a is amazing and it has no business being as cheap as it is.
07:24:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Go and physically verify the device before handing the 3a over

07:43:25 <prestocaso[m]> strcat: I didn't mean to be offensive, I'd incorrectly used conservative in reference to their using things like microg for those that are new or need apps or services that rely on play services

10:13:04 <strcat[m]> and retiring this one from development work
10:14:02 <Dylanger[m]> Fedora Silverblue is good
10:14:09 <Dylanger[m]> Podman works a treat
10:15:37 <prestocaso[m]> That uses the new package architecture .tree or something similar correct?
10:16:00 <Dylanger[m]> ostree yeah
10:16:41 * Dylanger[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qrGyNheZcaEMJktzslFdhfCa/message.txt >
10:16:47 <prestocaso[m]> I'd looked at Fedora silver blue during the 32 beta and the potential seeming really cool. It was just a bit much for me
10:17:39 <Dylanger[m]> ```
10:17:39 <Dylanger[m]> podman run --rm -it -v ~/Projects/AOSP/Graphene/ccache:/ccache:Z -v ~/Projects/AOSP/Graphene/ssh:/root/.ssh:Z -v ~/Projects/AOSP/Graphene/aosp:/build:Z --pids-limit=999999 c54f0ac2949 bash
10:17:39 <Dylanger[m]> ```
10:17:49 <Dylanger[m]> Takes about 1 hour to build Graphene
10:18:18 <Dylanger[m]> AMD Ryzen 9 3950X 16-Core Processor, 64GB RAM
10:20:34 <strcat[m]> that's only for a clean build
10:20:38 <strcat[m]> an incremental build is much faster
10:20:49 <strcat[m]> you aren't doing clean builds every time for development
10:21:06 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah fair
10:22:23 <prestocaso[m]> Again, thanks everyone for the feedback, and thanks Daniel for all the hard work. I'm poking around post flash and this really feels clean and fast
10:23:44 <alex-resist_> Is building Graphene with 32GB of RAM borderline ok or borderline not ok?
10:25:01 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build
10:25:05 <strcat[m]> read the documentation
10:25:47 <strcat[m]> 16GB is adequate for building the OS with few jobs
10:25:51 <strcat[m]> it isn't adequate for building the Linux kernel
10:26:06 <strcat[m]> you need over 32GB of memory to build the Linux kernel with LTO
10:26:17 <strcat[m]> of course you could use any amount of swap and accept it being slow
10:26:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> alex-resist_ it's fine unless your CPU is too overpowered
10:27:03 <alex-resist_> strcat I have read it, it says 16 GB or more, and I just wanted to hear about some dev's experience with a certain amount of RAM
10:27:26 <strcat[m]> the documentation is written by the developers
10:28:13 <strcat[m]> if you trying to be productive doing many clean and incremental builds then I recommend a very powerful CPU with many cores and 64GB of memory
10:29:00 <alex-resist_> strcat ok thanks, that answers my question :) Currently I have a 32 GB machine, so it's somewhere in between
10:29:22 <strcat[m]> the memory is needed to support more jobs
10:29:42 <strcat[m]> 32GB + 32GB swapfile should be fine for building the Linux kernel and it won't actually have to use much swap
10:29:52 <strcat[m]> 32GB without swap probably can't link Linux with LTO
10:30:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> [alex-resist_](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_alex-resist_:matrix.org) so I do like 64gb + 32gb ram/swap
10:30:41 <alex-resist_> I'll try with 32GB of RAM and 32GB swap on SSD. See how far I can get
10:30:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> With 20 jobs I can easily hit 50+ GB
10:30:56 <renlord[m]> Maybe I should buy a cheap poweredge workstation
10:31:24 <renlord[m]> Turn off all spectre mitigations.
10:31:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Especially when it gets to the java part
10:31:39 <strcat[m]> my recommendation is to build with purchased parts
10:31:55 <strcat[m]> it depends on how much money you have to spend
10:31:58 <renlord[m]> Poweredge backdoored!?
10:32:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord[m] "Turn off all spectre mitigations"> BTW does this actually work
10:32:18 <strcat[m]> a lot of the spectre stuff is in microcode / hardware now
10:32:24 <strcat[m]> so you can't avoid the performance hit
10:32:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> I turned off all mitigations and I don't see an improvement of more than a minute
10:33:02 <renlord[m]> My old intel it makes a difference on ryzen not at all
10:39:11 <Dylanger[m]> I was planning on re-running `repo init` every new release/tag and update via `adb sideload`, can take advantage of incremental updates?
10:39:38 <Dylanger[m]> > Incremental updates shipping only the changes between two versions
10:39:54 <strcat[m]> if you're making production builds for actual usage, you should do clean builds
10:39:56 <Dylanger[m]> Can I still use incremental updates if I repo init'd with a tag?
10:39:59 <strcat[m]> read the documentation at https://grapheneos.org/build
10:40:10 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: sure but you shouldn't be doing incremental builds for production use
10:40:14 <strcat[m]> build documentation covers all this
10:40:33 <Dylanger[m]> I'll RTFM
10:40:40 <strcat[m]> for a production build you should clear `out/` as it documents before building
10:40:48 <strcat[m]> otherwise you can generally use incremental builds for development
10:42:00 <renlord[m]> RTFM is always good
10:45:08 <renlord[m]> if ppl had to trust root CAs vs. DNS root authorities, which one?
10:47:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Root CAs
10:48:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Correct me if wrong
10:48:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org)
10:50:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: why not use DANE only for pinning and verify both?
10:51:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmmmmmm
10:51:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
10:53:07 <strcat[m]> and btw we have DANE set up for the https://attestation.app/, https://grapheneos.org/ and https://releases.grapheneos.org/ web servers
10:53:15 <strcat[m]> although it isn't used by browsers or most other kinds of clients
10:53:49 <strcat[m]> unlike the mail.grapheneos.org server where DANE is actually widely adopted for SMTP and is important for having TLS authentication at all (since by default there is no CA system unless you use MTA-STS which is like dynamic HSTS only)
10:58:58 <renlord[m]> dnssec adoption is not widespread yet though
10:59:38 <renlord[m]> and dane enforcement iiuc is opportunisitc
11:00:00 <renlord[m]> i.e. even if dane verification failed, emails still get sent in the clear
11:00:17 <renlord[m]> whereas MTA-STS has strict enforcement policy if the receiving server insists
11:00:49 <renlord[m]> not quite related to the trust factor, but there's that difference between mta-sts and dane at least
11:01:27 <redu321[m]> I am a bit worried about the auto update of graphene. What if Graphene chooses to do a update with some security leak, because a government for example is saying they need to do that. Is it maybe secure om not put your phone in auto update mode but to do i manually?
11:02:11 <renlord[m]> if i'm in charge of releases, you should be very worried
11:02:14 <renlord[m]> hehe
11:03:10 <strcat[m]> renlord: you're incorrect about how DANE works
11:03:18 <strcat[m]> "i.e. even if dane verification failed, emails still get sent in the clear" is not accurate
11:03:29 <strcat[m]> if DANE is present in DNS, it is enforced, in a proper implementation
11:03:47 <strcat[m]> redu321: your reasoning doesn don't make any sense
11:04:01 <strcat[m]> redu321: your reasoning doesn't make any sense
11:04:22 <strcat[m]> redu321: please read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
11:04:43 <strcat[m]> if you want to disable automatic updates, you're free to do that per the documentation
11:04:49 <strcat[m]> how are you going to be secure if you don't install the updates?
11:05:35 <strcat[m]> but you're free to have an insecure device if you want, you can disable updates and avoid installing them, or you can sideload updates, I don't see how it provides you any protection against an insider attack but you do you
11:06:32 <strcat[m]> renlord: opportunistic in regards to DANE means that if DANE is not present, it's not a failure, if it is present then it is enforced
11:06:53 <strcat[m]> renlord: DNSSEC makes it so that you can securely check whether a record is present, lack of presence is signed
11:07:18 <strcat[m]> so this is not a security hole in any way, it just means that servers not using DANE aren't unsupported
11:07:42 <strcat[m]> renlord: and DNSSEC adoption doesn't really matter - if a domain is using DNSSEC / DANE, it works fine
11:13:39 <somenerd[m]> > but you're free to have an insecure device if you want, you can disable updates and avoid installing them, or you can sideload updates, I don't see how it provides you any protection against an insider attack but you do you
11:13:39 <somenerd[m]> maybe a chance to audit?
11:14:26 <somenerd[m]>  * > but you're free to have an insecure device if you want, you can disable updates and avoid installing them, or you can sideload updates, I don't see how it provides you any protection against an insider attack but you do you
11:14:26 <somenerd[m]> maybe a chance to audit before updating?
11:15:06 <somenerd[m]> not sure though tbh
11:15:22 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sDEXUyectYsvtkkdHoKFhAHz/message.txt >
11:15:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Look at the git history and reuse one of our old kernels and match the build date and number exactly
11:17:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should have identical builds
11:18:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only difference may be some bug in clang sometimes compiles some code differently. Though this is very rare
11:18:58 <strcat[m]> somenerd: you're free to use your own builds and "audit" changes
11:19:39 <strcat[m]> somenerd: I don't see what any of this has to do with the way the Updater UX works
11:19:45 <strcat[m]> if you want to disable updates, disable them
11:19:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> [somenerd](https://matrix.to/#/@lelmister101:matrix.org) I really recommend you run official
11:20:00 <strcat[m]> highly recommended to leave updates enabled
11:20:09 <somenerd[m]> not my argument
11:20:28 <somenerd[m]> just trying to see what he meant
11:20:28 <strcat[m]> somenerd: you're not making an argument, you made a statement that doesn't make sense
11:20:36 <somenerd[m]> hmm
11:20:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> You could follow the instructions incorrectly and mess up unofficial and you won't have auditor support unless you run your own
11:20:52 <Dylanger[m]> strcat: Is there a way I can get an alert when there's an update? I guess just watching reddit
11:21:04 <Dylanger[m]> Now that I'll be manually updating
11:21:13 <renlord[m]> Dylanger: it just downloads when there's an update
11:21:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> [somenerd](https://matrix.to/#/@lelmister101:matrix.org) well none of those are real issues
11:21:28 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: twitter, github
11:21:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "strcat: Is there a way I can get"> Watch for new tags
11:21:48 <Dylanger[m]> üëçÔ∏è
11:21:52 <Dylanger[m]> ty
11:22:27 <renlord[m]> strcat: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/pull/14
11:22:35 <renlord[m]> no good?
11:22:36 <renlord[m]> :(
11:22:51 <renlord[m]> i think should nag if no update
11:22:59 <renlord[m]> following unix principles
11:22:59 <strcat[m]> renlord: it needs to be rebased
11:23:39 <strcat[m]> you have to open a new PR targeting the 11 branch
11:23:40 <strcat[m]> and rebase
11:23:44 <renlord[m]> oh no i got rid of gos-10
11:24:18 <renlord[m]> ok i'll do it some time
11:24:49 <renlord[m]> oh wait
11:24:55 <renlord[m]> the remote branch still exists LOL
11:26:06 <strcat[m]> anyway people need to read https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates and https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
11:26:15 <strcat[m]> if you want to disable updates temporarily, follow the guide there
11:26:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> [renlord](https://matrix.to/#/@renlord:matrix.org) I can rebase it and send it if you want
11:26:33 <strcat[m]> I don't see any reason to change how it works, no one has presented one
11:26:37 <renlord[m]> anupritaisno1: sounds good!
11:26:49 <renlord[m]> i like how it works now
11:26:57 <strcat[m]> if you're getting your updates through Updater then that implies Updater downloading it, verifying the signature and installing it
11:26:59 <renlord[m]> if it works, it should just stay quiet
11:27:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renlord[m] "anupritaisno1: sounds good!"> Yeah I have a bunch of other changes I need to send for updater too
11:27:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> So if there's any changes strcat needs I'll do those in separate commits
11:27:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Besides that code is pretty simple
11:31:18 <strcat[m]> I'm curious if there is any decent open source gallery app we could use instead of the legacy Gallery2 sample app
11:31:28 <strcat[m]> doesn't need that stupid filter stuff
11:31:44 <somenerd[m]> which ones have you tried so far? just wondering
11:31:45 <strcat[m]> just basic editing (cropping, rotate, flip, etc.)
11:32:07 <strcat[m]> none, haven't found one that implements the required APIs and is permissively licensed
11:32:21 <somenerd[m]> hmm
11:32:35 <somenerd[m]> maybe improve the present one?
11:32:49 <strcat[m]> no one has expressed any interest in doing that
11:32:56 <strcat[m]> are you volunteering?
11:33:09 <somenerd[m]> no, I can't as I have no dev experience
11:33:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "maybe improve the present one?"> And who will do that?
11:33:20 <somenerd[m]> yeah
11:33:25 <somenerd[m]> didn't think that through
11:33:29 <strcat[m]> the sample Gallery2 app from AOSP has serious bugs and is essentially just a pile of legacy code gradually being stripped down as it rots awahy
11:33:33 <strcat[m]>  * the sample Gallery2 app from AOSP has serious bugs and is essentially just a pile of legacy code gradually being stripped down as it rots away
11:34:09 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Gallery switched to GPLv3 and then also started using a proprietary photo editing library so I think the days of it being an open source app are numbered anyway
11:34:16 <strcat[m]> it supports doing an open source build without that library
11:34:23 <strcat[m]> also I think it's in violation of the GPLv3
11:34:25 <strcat[m]> so yeah, it's problematic
11:34:30 <somenerd[m]> wait what
11:34:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "didn't think that through"> The problem is that there's more serious issues that need to be worked on right now
11:34:40 <strcat[m]> because it loads a proprietary library but yet the developer made it GPLv3
11:34:50 <strcat[m]> which is not allowed - so they are accepting code from people as GPLv3
11:35:00 <somenerd[m]> wait
11:35:02 <strcat[m]> also I don't see how they just changed the license like that without copyright assignment from contributors
11:35:07 <somenerd[m]> f-droid still allows this????
11:35:18 <strcat[m]> somenerd: there is an alternate build of the app without the proprietary library
11:35:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> If people want to volunteer to pick up on work we can't do right away
11:35:24 <strcat[m]> missing the photo editor
11:35:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Go ahead
11:35:42 <strcat[m]> somenerd: F-Droid temporarily stopped updating it
11:35:52 <strcat[m]> anyway we can't include GPLv3 code regardless because it conflicts with what we want to provide
11:35:53 <somenerd[m]> ohh
11:35:54 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 is fine
11:36:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "GPLv2 is fine"> What about confidential and proprietary?
11:36:40 <coffeebag[m]> Hello guys, currently working on Gallery issues crash (when cropping, filtering...)
11:36:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sarcasm ^
11:36:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I said above it has to be permissively licensed
11:37:38 <somenerd[m]> what is the problem with GPLv3?
11:38:00 <strcat[m]> too non-free for us
11:38:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> We want to make devices that users cannot unlock
11:38:08 <strcat[m]> doesn't permit making a device with an immutable root of trust
11:38:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> And install other operating systems
11:38:25 <strcat[m]> we want it to be possible to take GrapheneOS and make a device with an immutable root of trust
11:38:40 <somenerd[m]> like with custom hardware?
11:38:44 <strcat[m]> if we include GPLv3 code, we're forbidding people from using GrapheneOS that way
11:38:46 <strcat[m]> somenerd: yes
11:38:57 <strcat[m]> so we won't include any GPLv3 code in the OS
11:39:08 <somenerd[m]> hmm
11:39:09 <somenerd[m]> yeah
11:39:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> <somenerd[m] "like with custom hardware?"> Basically the project needs to move in the hardware space too
11:39:27 <somenerd[m]> yeah
11:39:38 <somenerd[m]> it was in the roadmap right?
11:39:49 <strcat[m]> if we have custom hardware we want to be able to sell a variant of it with an immutable root of trust
11:39:57 <strcat[m]> and we want it to be possible for others to make devices
11:40:00 <strcat[m]> with an immutable root of trust
11:40:03 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 code is off the table
11:40:07 <somenerd[m]> that sounds really cool
11:40:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a lot of stuff in the roadmap
11:40:22 <somenerd[m]> (as far as I understand)
11:40:42 <renlord[m]> its an infinitely long roadmap
11:40:49 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "if we have custom hardware we wa"> RISC-V?
11:40:52 <Dylanger[m]> Open SoC?
11:41:00 <strcat[m]> not relevant to the topic
11:41:12 <Dylanger[m]> https://opentitan.org/
11:41:19 <Dylanger[m]> That's basically it already done
11:41:29 <somenerd[m]> yeah but the whole thing has to be
11:41:47 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: that's an open source secure element and I wouldn't call it done considering that we need an implementation of the Citadel APIs
11:41:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
11:41:58 <somenerd[m]> I believe I saw a post from u/GrapheneOS on custom open hardware
11:42:00 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it's not a general purpose SoC, it's a secure element like the Titan M
11:42:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Proper hardware security is not just slapping a strongbox on
11:42:18 <strcat[m]> that is a peripheral device essentially
11:42:38 <strcat[m]> there isn't a RISC-V smartphone SoC and we're obviously not going to be designing an SoC
11:42:56 <strcat[m]> in all likelihood we'd just use the SoC secure element implementation anyway
11:43:09 <strcat[m]> like the Qualcomm SPU
11:43:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> ECC ram too? ^
11:43:36 <strcat[m]> it's unrealistic to make our own security chip, we'd need an off-the-shelf one, so sure an off-the-shelf one based on OpenTitan / RISC-V with the full Citadel API would be fine...
11:43:38 <strcat[m]> but there isn't one
11:43:48 <strcat[m]> can't use things that do not exist...
11:45:00 <Dylanger[m]> Citadel... I have that bad boi in IDA somewhere
11:45:26 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: the firmware?
11:45:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) but how do developers unbrick these phones?
11:45:31 <strcat[m]> the OS parts are open source
11:45:35 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah
11:45:38 <Dylanger[m]> FW
11:45:45 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: don't see the relevance to the discussion
11:45:46 <Dylanger[m]> Cortex-M3 or something iirc
11:46:01 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: phones with the immutable root of trust flashed would be the production ones not the development devices
11:46:12 <somenerd[m]> would this happen after the move to a microkernel
11:46:16 <somenerd[m]> ?
11:46:18 <strcat[m]> you would not be doing development on a production model
11:46:22 <strcat[m]> somenerd: it's not tied to that
11:46:36 <strcat[m]> and I'd suggest carefully reading what's written on the site about that
11:46:42 <strcat[m]> you seem to have the wrong impression
11:47:05 <somenerd[m]> let me reread
11:47:13 <somenerd[m]> cuz I am kinda confused
11:47:26 <somenerd[m]> ohhh
11:47:30 <strcat[m]> don't see what that has to do with the topic
11:47:32 <somenerd[m]> so these are unrelated
11:47:41 <somenerd[m]> wonder why I thought they were...
11:47:53 <somenerd[m]> I should really read the docs carefully
11:47:55 <Dylanger[m]> If you used a SuzieQ (Orange dev cable from Google), you could interact directly with Citadel
11:48:23 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: the orange cable you're talking about is not from Google
11:48:35 <strcat[m]> and that only implements the ChromeOS Suzy-Q protocol
11:48:41 <strcat[m]> the Android cables are extended
11:48:47 <Dylanger[m]> Ah yeah that's the one
11:49:01 <strcat[m]> Android version requires more to get logs from Android
11:49:14 <somenerd[m]> TIL: google makes a lot of open source things
11:49:17 <strcat[m]> the cable you're talking about would only give you firmware logs, it's missing the other half (i.e. the OS logs)
11:49:37 <Dylanger[m]> It dropped me into a fully interactive shell
11:49:56 <Dylanger[m]> Wasn't like root or anything
11:50:03 <Dylanger[m]> But let me see fw versions etc
11:50:10 <Dylanger[m]> I think Google removed it
11:50:13 <Dylanger[m]> In 4
11:50:16 <Dylanger[m]> I should check
11:50:49 <strcat[m]> I'm aware of what it provides but you're talking about using it via an incomplete way
11:51:17 <strcat[m]> it works differently based on whether the device is unlocked and there are fastboot oem commands
11:51:30 <strcat[m]> we have proper complete debug cables
11:51:33 <strcat[m]> unlike those ChromeOS ones
11:51:43 <strcat[m]> we have someone that can make them
11:51:53 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "it works differently based on wh"> Pixel 3 _totally_ didn't
11:52:02 <Dylanger[m]> I remember doing it to a friends device that was locke
11:52:08 <Dylanger[m]>  * I remember doing it to a friends device that was locked
11:52:10 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote
11:52:13 <strcat[m]> > works differently
11:52:14 <Dylanger[m]> adb not enabled etc
11:52:21 <strcat[m]> it's not related to adb in any way
11:52:32 <strcat[m]> you seem really confused about what it does
11:52:46 <strcat[m]> there's no point in explaining to someone that knows what it does how it works
11:53:20 <strcat[m]> and we have proper cables with all the functionality rather than just basic firmware logs
11:53:34 <strcat[m]> i.e. being able to toggle on the OS logs from the kernel with fastboot
11:59:32 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "> works differently"> I know that these 2 things are totally seperate, the shell I was dropped into was some sort of UART terminal, the cable itself added resistance to D- line, muxing me to the Titan M, I only mentioned adb was disabled because I was able to take his _totally untouced Pixel 3, and interact with the (debatable) most IC of the device_
12:00:13 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with adb
12:00:15 <Dylanger[m]> > <@strcat:matrix.org> > works differently
12:00:15 <Dylanger[m]>  * I know that these 2 things are totally seperate, the shell I was dropped into was some sort of UART terminal, the cable itself added resistance to D- line, muxing me to the Titan M, I only mentioned adb was disabled because I was able to take his _totally untouced Pixel 3, and interact with the (debatable) most important/private IC in the device_
12:00:23 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't give any sensitive information without being unlocked and enabling the full logs
12:00:35 <Dylanger[m]> It's still a vector
12:00:37 <strcat[m]> as I said above it works differently when you actually enable the sensitive logging when unlocked
12:00:39 <strcat[m]> a vector for what?
12:01:14 <strcat[m]> you don't seem to understand what it's providing to you
12:01:19 <strcat[m]> you can't "interact" with the Titan M using it
12:01:21 <strcat[m]> you can get very basic status information from firmware, that's it
12:01:45 <strcat[m]> I'm fully aware of what it makes available and how the access controls on it work
12:02:13 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "I'm fully aware of what it makes"> Oooo great, please expand on this
12:02:21 <strcat[m]> and you also seem confused about what the Titan M provides
12:02:26 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: expand on what?
12:02:37 <strcat[m]> if the device isn't unlocked you can't use it to get sensitive logs
12:02:40 <strcat[m]> that's how it works
12:02:50 <strcat[m]> there are fastboot oem commands tied to the debugging features
12:02:55 <strcat[m]> you can't use them when locked
12:03:13 <strcat[m]> even when unlocked it doesn't offer that much functionality on a production device
12:03:26 <strcat[m]> mostly you can just get the rest of the logs including the OS logs
12:03:31 <strcat[m]> useful for debugging early boot issues
12:03:48 <coffeebag[m]> I have a question about GrapheneOS on 4a : is it normal that i don't have notifications on my apps ?
12:03:54 <strcat[m]> and again it has nothing to do with adb
12:04:07 <strcat[m]> coffeebag: be specific about what you mean
12:04:08 <strcat[m]> which apps
12:04:15 <strcat[m]> notifications work fine on GrapheneOS
12:04:15 <coffeebag[m]> All
12:04:23 <strcat[m]> coffeebag: you probably turned on DND then
12:04:26 <strcat[m]> turn off do not disturb
12:04:44 <coffeebag[m]> Nope it's off
12:04:52 <strcat[m]> doesn't align with what you said above
12:05:01 <strcat[m]> be specific about which apps don't provide notifications
12:05:11 <coffeebag[m]> For exemple : Signal
12:05:14 <strcat[m]> if you use the built-in clock app for example, those notifications work fine right?
12:05:24 <strcat[m]> coffeebag: Signal notifications work fine on GrapheneOS
12:05:32 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you've changed the notification settings or have DND enabled in some form
12:05:33 <strcat[m]> check
12:05:43 <coffeebag[m]> I have notifications but not thz dot
12:05:51 <coffeebag[m]> I will double check
12:06:01 <strcat[m]> what do you mean dot
12:06:34 <coffeebag[m]> A dot on top of the app logo
12:06:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Notification dot
12:06:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> What
12:06:55 <coffeebag[m]> To Signal that there is notifications unread for this app
12:07:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> You mean unread counters?
12:07:16 <somenerd[m]> yeah, I think they meant that
12:07:23 <strcat[m]> coffeebag: so notifications do work fine, you're talking about the launcher notification dot?
12:08:17 <coffeebag[m]> I mean on home screen, my apps with unread messages don't have Dot Notification (the dot on top of the logo of the app)
12:08:22 <coffeebag[m]> sorry my english is crap
12:08:32 <strcat[m]> make sure you have that option enabled
12:08:35 <strcat[m]> in the launcher settings
12:08:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah notification dot
12:08:44 <strcat[m]> long press on the home screen and go to settings
12:08:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> [coffeebag](https://matrix.to/#/@ukah:matrix.org) if you're lost, go to settings, reset app preferences and reboot
12:09:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> That resets notifications too
12:09:18 <coffeebag[m]> Erf ok i found
12:09:19 <strcat[m]> look at Advanced in the Notifications Settings
12:09:20 <coffeebag[m]> sorry for that
12:09:22 <coffeebag[m]> thx a lot
12:09:27 <strcat[m]> it has an option for the dot on lockscreen
12:09:32 <strcat[m]> afaik that's enabled by default
12:09:56 <coffeebag[m]> didn't know this option for graphene
12:10:01 <coffeebag[m]> it's default on Stock rom
12:10:09 <coffeebag[m]> mb ! thx
12:10:13 <strcat[m]> it's the default in GrapheneOS too
12:10:17 <strcat[m]> you disabled it
12:10:19 <coffeebag[m]> wut
12:10:45 <coffeebag[m]> weird, peraps
12:10:50 <coffeebag[m]> (btw i use the 4A)
12:11:51 <strcat[m]> perhaps you switched launchers and switched back, might have disabled it
12:11:55 <strcat[m]> or you disabled it specifically
12:11:59 <strcat[m]> but it's enabled by default
12:24:54 <zugzwang[m]> Micay please enlighten us : is Ultrasonic beacon tracking possible or is it total bs?
12:26:51 <engulf[m]> It is totally possible and it is used by many advertising and tracking companies
12:27:04 <engulf[m]>  * It is totally possible and it is used by many advertising and tracking companies at the moment
12:27:13 <zugzwang[m]> <engulf[m] "It is totally possible and it is"> Hmm

12:33:30 <somenerd[m]> lol
12:38:49 <engulf[m]> <renlord[m] "there's also a paper on using la"> That's not really something that would affect most of us, although that might change.
12:39:55 <engulf[m]> Here is a Blackhat talk about Ultrasonic Cross-Device tracking
12:39:55 <engulf[m]> https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=THFOnA6m8KM
12:41:36 <engulf[m]> But if you want to have more specific conversation about Ultrasonic tracking, I would suggest Techlore group as this is intended for GrapheneOS
12:42:46 <somenerd[m]> or the off topic one
12:44:32 <strcat[m]> zugzwang: we have the added Sensors permission for very good reasons
12:47:44 <saucy-salamander> So when my alarm triggers it seems like I have to unlock my phone to dismiss it (default app, Pixel 4 XL) anyone experience this also?
12:54:47 <engulf[m]> strcat: Is it "normal" that apps like `10062`, `10152` and `10190` have all used way over 10MB (in some cases over 50MB) of WiFi in last 30 days?
12:55:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
12:56:43 <somenerd[m]> what are those apps anyway?
12:57:01 <engulf[m]> Can you explain what kind of data is transferred, to where and why?
12:57:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> First tell me how you got said "data"
13:02:16 <engulf[m]> You go to: Setting->Network & internet->Wi-Fi->Wi-Fi data usage?
13:02:48 <engulf[m]>  * By going to: Setting->Network & internet->Wi-Fi->Wi-Fi data usage?
14:40:14 <Guest26643> I want to improve my privacy in 2021 and atm I'm used to the conveniance of iPhones, I'd like to switch to Pixel with grapheneOS tho. How long does it "usually" take until there is a grapheneOS for a "new" Pixel phone? For example when can we "expect" a grapheneOS for the Pixel 5?
14:41:02 <Guest26643> I know you cant tell for sure. I'm simply interested in an educated guess from someone who has witnessed the release of for example the Pixel 4 and can tell me how long it took them there
14:50:13 <digitalfrontier[> > <@kopolee11:matrix.org> Just a note that it is not unexpected that GrapheneOS warns you about apps that are targeting an old API level. That is fully as intended.
14:50:13 <digitalfrontier[> > And many of the default apps are really just placeholders for comparability reasons, not meant to actually be used.
14:50:13 <digitalfrontier[> Thanks for the detailed explanation! My thanks to strcat as well for clarifying further.
14:51:59 <somenerd[m]> > meh, all kinds of side-channels exist
14:51:59 <somenerd[m]> the sad part is that the tone seems like this is normal
14:52:14 <somenerd[m]>  * > meh, all kinds of side-channels exist
14:52:14 <somenerd[m]> the sad part is that the tone makes this seem like it's normal
14:55:10 <strcat[m]> Guest26643: it will take *forever* if people never step up to do the work
14:55:20 <strcat[m]> Guest26643: there is no guarantee of support for newer Pixels
14:55:32 <strcat[m]> so far no one is working on those and we still need more people helping with the 4a
14:55:45 <Guest26643> Understood thanks
14:59:42 <digitalfrontier[> <strcat[m] "I'm curious if there is any dece"> What about Simple Gallery Pro?
15:00:41 <digitalfrontier[> Unless the Apache 2.0 license puts people off?
15:02:32 <ultracard[m]> <digitalfrontier[ "Unless the Apache 2.0 license pu"> the first thing i do on a fresh android install is to replace the default gallery app with Simple Gallery Pro
15:02:34 <ultracard[m]> it's amazing
15:02:53 <revelation1318[m> Same here.
15:04:30 <digitalfrontier[> Agreed. It's really good. Skimming over the Apache 2.0 license the only thing that stands out is the following "This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file."
15:06:44 <digitalfrontier[> But it does state "reasonable and customary use." I don't know, I'm not sure how to interpret that.
15:08:38 <revelation1318[m> It says GNU GPL v3 in GitHub.
15:09:32 <revelation1318[m> It was changed from Apache v2 to GPL v3 in 2019. F-Droid is not up to date here.
15:10:03 <somenerd[m]> yeah
15:10:15 <somenerd[m]> and apparently GPLv3 is a problem
15:10:56 <somenerd[m]> > we want it to be possible to take GrapheneOS and make a device with an immutable root of trust

15:13:53 <somenerd[m]>  * and GPLv3 is a problem
15:14:27 <strcat[m]> digitalfrontier: Simple Gallery Pro is GPLv3 and uses a proprietary library incompatible with GPLv3 for photo editing (which is quite strange)
15:14:41 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have a proper photo editor in a build without that
15:14:47 <strcat[m]> and they've stated they won't be developing one
15:18:12 <digitalfrontier[> <revelation1318[m "It was changed from Apache v2 to"> Thanks mate!
15:18:52 <digitalfrontier[> <strcat[m] "digitalfrontier: Simple Gallery "> Well that's not just strange but also a bit depressing.
15:19:35 <strcat[m]> we won't include GPLv3 code but even if we were willing to do that I am concerned about the future of all those simple mobile tools apps
15:20:22 <somenerd[m]> yeah that proprietary library is rather concerning
15:22:37 <strcat[m]> I think Gallery2 broke because of OS changes rather than internal changes
15:22:43 <strcat[m]> backwards incompatible change somewhere
15:22:58 <strcat[m]> it was likely already doing something incorrectly and it broke
15:23:06 <strcat[m]> depending on some implementation detail or something like that
15:23:09 <somenerd[m]> really?
15:23:16 <strcat[m]> it's a really crufty old app
15:23:21 <strcat[m]> it was likely doing something really wrong
15:23:21 <somenerd[m]> wow there are no more options then...?
15:23:29 <somenerd[m]> that's sad
15:23:29 <strcat[m]> and now it broke
15:23:32 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you mean by that
15:23:56 <strcat[m]> in the short term someone could fix Gallery2
15:24:17 <somenerd[m]> > I don't know what you mean by that
15:24:17 <somenerd[m]> I meant no more FOSS and good gallery options
15:29:19 <DonaldBiden> Hello. I found a good offer for a used Pixel 2. Is it good enough or should I wait for a bargain on a newer model?
15:31:45 <digitalfrontier[> Pixel 4a is only $ tree fiddy.
15:32:11 <digitalfrontier[> Plus taxes obviously but come on that's cheap.
15:32:14 <redibc[m]> I just got a used pixel 3 for 130 us
15:32:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> Pixels don't have a very long software life. Best get the newest one you can.
15:33:41 <digitalfrontier[> <redibc[m] "I just got a used pixel 3 for 13"> Not bad. I don't trust anything used though. But that's just me.
15:57:55 <joltman[m]> After installing Simple Gallery Pro, is it good to disable the stock Gallery?
16:01:51 <digitalfrontier[> I did so and have had zero issues.
16:02:38 <digitalfrontier[> It will just be hidden if you disable it.
16:03:47 <joltman[m]> How do you re-enable it later if you want to go back to it later and it's hidden?
16:04:34 <digitalfrontier[> Settings, Apps & Notifications, See all apps
16:04:40 <joltman[m]> Thanks!
16:05:04 <digitalfrontier[> You're welcome!
16:38:39 <DonaldBiden> Found a good offer for a used Pixel 2. Is it good enough or should I wait for a bargain on a newer model?
16:40:36 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 is almost dropped
16:40:45 <strcat[m]> get a Pixel 4a, nothing else should be considered for a budget device
16:40:58 <DonaldBiden> OK ty
16:41:23 <somenerd[m]> Is there any plan on expanding the docs?
16:41:31 <strcat[m]> docs about what?
16:41:41 <strcat[m]> the docs are regularly being expanded
16:41:49 <strcat[m]> people tend to just not read them
16:41:51 <somenerd[m]> about GrapheneOS
16:41:56 <DonaldBiden> The Google Pixel so expensive for its specs...
16:41:57 <strcat[m]> about what specifically?
16:42:10 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: which device are you talking about
16:42:16 <somenerd[m]> not really anything spacific
16:42:18 <somenerd[m]>  * not really anything specific
16:42:18 <strcat[m]> the Pixel 4a is the budget device
16:42:29 <strcat[m]> somenerd: they're being regularly expanded, your question is strange
16:42:42 <somenerd[m]> oh ok
16:43:20 <DonaldBiden> pixel 4a is $350. pixel 3 $213. pixel 2 $201.
16:44:07 <mrxx_0[m]> somenerd: You need a specific information which isn't on the website ?
16:44:07 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 is obsolete and about to be dropped
16:44:22 <strcat[m]> I would expect it to be really cheap when it's more than 3 years old
16:44:31 <strcat[m]> I doubt it is a new Pixel 2 for $201
16:44:39 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you're comparing a new Pixel 4a to a used Pixel 2
16:44:51 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: You need a specific information which isn't on the website ?
16:44:51 <somenerd[m]> no, not yet
16:45:50 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: same with that Pixel 3 - you can't really compare prices of a new device to used ones
16:46:11 <strcat[m]> and a Pixel 3 is a bit over 2 years old, Pixel 2 is a bit over 3 years old
16:46:42 <DonaldBiden> @strcat[m] no, these are used prices
16:46:45 <strcat[m]> 4a is from August this year
16:46:54 <DonaldBiden> including shipping and taxes it can be more
16:47:17 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: $350 USD is the price of a *new* Pixel 4a
16:48:35 <strcat[m]> it was released a few months ago so there are probably not many used ones
16:48:41 <DonaldBiden> strcat[m] I just checked ebay, that's the bottom price for a used one.
16:48:47 <DonaldBiden> exactly
16:49:03 <strcat[m]> if you buy a Pixel 2 you'll need to replace it in a month
16:49:15 <DonaldBiden> So Pixel 3 is the only budget viable option?
16:49:19 <strcat[m]> you won't be getting competitive security day one and it'll be dropped soon
16:49:31 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 is not a budget option, it's a 2 year old flagship device
16:49:34 <DonaldBiden> They should say that in the FAQ
16:49:39 <strcat[m]> buying old devices is not a good way to save money
16:49:47 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: we do
16:49:52 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
16:50:01 <DonaldBiden> Idk, they break fast.
16:50:04 <strcat[m]> 4, 4 XL, 4a are the only recommended devices
16:51:08 <DonaldBiden> I was looking for a phone with cracked glass but even those are expensive...
16:51:23 <DonaldBiden> They cost so much more than Redmi
16:51:44 <strcat[m]> I have never had a Nexus or Pixel phone die before it became end-of-life
16:52:04 <DonaldBiden> Ppl crack the glass all the time
16:52:29 <DonaldBiden> I had a Samsung which I bricked, idk even know how
16:52:38 <strcat[m]> I've had a Nexus 5, Nexus 7, Nexus 10, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel 1, Pixel 1 XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL
16:52:41 <strcat[m]> none have died early
16:52:50 <jpds> DonaldBiden: Hardware randomly dies all the time
16:53:17 <strcat[m]> the only one that has broken at all is the Nexus 5 because that thing was poorly built and the USB port wore out during development + after it was already EOL the screen broke just from the whole thing starting to fall apart
16:53:26 <strcat[m]> but the devices now are much better built
16:53:34 <strcat[m]> that was a lower end plastic phone
16:53:45 <strcat[m]> with really weak thin glass for the screen in comparison
16:54:02 <DonaldBiden> jpds that's what I was trying to say, it's better to buy a cheap old one which is supposed to last only a year
16:54:21 <strcat[m]> jpds: a small percent of hardware
16:54:24 <strcat[m]> and there's a warranty
16:55:03 <DonaldBiden> I buy them cheap without a warranty...
16:55:18 <strcat[m]> in my experience, when hardware dies in ~4-5 years, it's almost always in the first couple months (unless you're talking about breaking it)
16:55:19 <DonaldBiden> I don't remember the last time I owned a new device...
16:55:26 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: well, Pixel 2 is essentially unsupported at this point already
16:55:43 <DonaldBiden> Gotcha
16:55:47 <strcat[m]> it might not get an update next month, we don't know how much longer it'll be supported
16:55:56 <strcat[m]> Pixel 3 has a year of guaranteed updates left, Pixel 3a somewhat longer
16:57:09 <DonaldBiden> Why did the devs choose the Pixel?
16:57:17 <strcat[m]> atm the devices have 3 years guaranteed support on release
16:57:22 <DonaldBiden> Because it's well documented?
16:57:23 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
16:57:38 <strcat[m]> because they offer the best privacy and security
16:57:59 <strcat[m]> most devices don't have full security updates available let alone being competitive on firmware/hardware privacy and security
16:58:00 <somenerd[m]> I wish that they had more years of support though
16:58:04 <DonaldBiden> How ironic for a Google device
16:58:23 <strcat[m]> the vast majority of devices don't support all the hardware-based security features for another OS
16:58:32 <somenerd[m]> probably good reasons as to why there are less years of support compared to iPhones though
16:58:32 <DonaldBiden> Gotcha, so what you're saying is Google tried to do an iPhone competitor
16:59:06 * mrxx_0[m] uploaded an image: image.png (230KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pbSytVLfHAAggqlKOjIskGjm/image.png >
16:59:20 <strcat[m]> just bear in mind that's the minimum guarantee
16:59:42 <DonaldBiden> Ty
16:59:45 <strcat[m]> for example Pixel 1 got last update December 2019
17:00:05 <strcat[m]> the date when it's actually dropped isn't known
17:02:18 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4, 4 XL and 4a are also the most secure among what we support
17:02:26 <strcat[m]> and we have the best maintenance for those
17:02:35 <DonaldBiden> Looks like only Lineage phones are an option for me...
17:02:37 <strcat[m]> we have higher standards for maintenance teams than we used to
17:03:08 <somenerd[m]> not really a good idea though...
17:03:29 <DonaldBiden> -_-
17:03:47 <somenerd[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/android.html#lineageos
17:03:52 <strcat[m]> this channel is only about GrapheneOS
17:04:00 <somenerd[m]> yeah
17:04:07 <somenerd[m]> I'll move to offtopic
17:04:58 <DonaldBiden> Let me put it this way: are the NSO guys only hacking Androids?
17:06:05 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: not sure what the relevance is to the discussion, and no
17:06:39 <nicob[m]> How is the Pixel 4 without fingerprint the 'most secure among we support'?
17:06:43 <DonaldBiden> There's something called security by obscurity
17:06:51 <strcat[m]> read that https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support section in the FAQ I linked earlier
17:08:02 <strcat[m]> DonaldBiden: 'security through obscurity' is primarily referred to as a way of criticizing weak approaches to security... and again I'm not seeing the connection to the discussion
17:08:23 <strcat[m]> nicob: fingerprint scanning and the Pixel 4 IR-based facial scanning is a very similar system
17:08:48 <strcat[m]> nicob: it doesn't really have much to do with the security we're talking about there
17:09:47 <DonaldBiden> OK, thanks
17:11:21 <strcat[m]> biometric security is an optional secondary unlock option for each profile
17:11:28 <strcat[m]> we'd like to implement our planned 2 factor secondary unlock option
17:14:30 <nicob[m]> That would be ideal, something you know and something you have, until then, can you point me a source where it says it is as secure as the fingerprint on the 3? As I seem to recall it is not...But apparently I am off
17:15:25 <strcat[m]> you seem to be confusing it with camera-based facial recognition
17:15:28 <strcat[m]> which is not what it is
17:16:33 <strcat[m]> if you want to do research on it, go ahead
17:16:49 <strcat[m]> it's the same kind of approach that modern iPhones use for facial scanning
17:17:02 <strcat[m]> and it's very unlike using a camera for it
17:17:50 <strcat[m]> it's much easier to fool a fingerprint scanner than the iPhone / Pixel 4 facial scanning, it has advantages and disadvantages
17:18:07 <nicob[m]> Ok
17:29:45 <Wonderfall[m]> Facial scanning is nice, too bad it works from hardly to not at all with masks ; that was to be expected.
17:41:15 <nicob[m]> This is what scared me when looking into pixel face unlock the first time.. The bulletpoints under 'How face unlock works' - important https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9517039?hl=en&ref_topic=7083614
17:43:38 <nicob[m]> Of course there are downsides to the fingerprintsensor but they are generally more in the users control..
17:56:21 <strcat[m]> there are people with similar enough fingerprints that it collides
17:56:39 <strcat[m]> the face scanning is much more unique than fingerprint scanning
17:56:43 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier
18:43:55 <lev[m]> <nicob[m] "This is what scared me when look"> there are settings that mitigate the accidental unlock (i.e. face unlocks the phone, but you still have to swipe up to get to the home screen)
18:44:17 <lev[m]> also if you are captured, they could also hold the the phone to your finger
18:44:42 <lev[m]> you'd need to restart the phone before you were restrained in either case
18:44:53 <lev[m]> I dunno how to help you if you have an evil twin though lol
18:45:35 <coffeebag[m]> I want to fix bugs on the gallery2 app. But i don't have enough resources to build the entire GrapheneOS. Is the following thing is possible to do ? : Get the kernel then ONLY build gallery2. Disable my gallery2 app then install it on my device (which have grapheneOS) to test
18:57:04 <strcat[m]> you can build only gallery2
18:57:15 <strcat[m]> you seem to have a misunderstanding about what a kernel is and it's not relevant to this
18:57:32 <strcat[m]> you need to change the app id to something else if you want to install it on GrapheneOS
18:57:39 <strcat[m]> since you don't have our release keys
18:58:34 <coffeebag[m]> i'm talking about the kernel google sunfish for example
18:58:37 <coffeebag[m]> it's a kernel right ?
18:58:49 <strcat[m]> the normal way to do development is just to do an initial build, then start making changes, then do incremental builds
18:58:52 <strcat[m]> and test your changes
18:59:13 <strcat[m]> incremental builds only rebuild what changed and then make new images with those changes
18:59:14 <louipc> you can develop most apps without building the whole OS
18:59:23 <strcat[m]> if you really want there are commands for building specific apps in the AOSP tree, etc.
18:59:27 <coffeebag[m]> And i was asking if i need it in order to build Gallery2 bcs Gallery2 use internal apis no ?
18:59:37 <coffeebag[m]> ok
19:00:02 <strcat[m]> change to the directory of Gallery2 and run `mm` instead of `m` at the top level
19:00:19 <strcat[m]> after setting up the environment and choosing target
19:00:30 <coffeebag[m]> ok thks i will do this
19:01:11 * louipc thumbs up

19:42:24 <ultracard[m]> Hey guys, I am currently running Calyx OS on my pixel 4a. But now I want to switch to graphene OS. But I have a few questions: 1. should i flash stock android before installing Graphene OS and install all updates to update to the latest firmware or is graphene OS itself able to update the devices firmware via OTA updates. 2. Is there anything i need to do differently when installing graphene OS over a Calyx OS
19:42:24 <ultracard[m]> installation compared to when the phone is running stock android.
19:42:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> <ultracard[m] "Hey guys, I am currently running"> Just flash grapheneos directly
19:43:42 <strcat[m]> ultracard: GrapheneOS has all the firmware in the factory images and updates
19:45:06 <ultracard[m]> also, does anyone know a bit about android user profiles. Because I would like to install whatsapp on a seperate user account because I would imagine that having several security privacy benefits. But I' don't know what a different user account does. For example: can whatsapp read files stored on another users account if i give it permission to access external storage?
19:45:17 <ultracard[m]> <ultracard[m] "also, does anyone know a bit abo"> nice, sounds great
19:45:27 <ultracard[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just flash grapheneos directly"> thanks, will do that
19:46:47 <ultracard[m]> <ultracard[m] "also, does anyone know a bit abo"> and also: can an app installed on another user account run in the background while I'm on a different user profile?
19:48:18 <ultracard[m]> so: is whatsapp able to send out data to mark zuckerberg if I am logged into another user account or is the app suspended while i'm not on teh user account it's installed on
19:50:46 <ultracard[m]> I know i should stop using this creepy application anyways, but some people are simply not willing to use signal messenger and don't care about privacy because they think that only criminals like drug dealers need privacy
19:55:34 <strcat[m]> ultracard: apps can't share data or communicate across profiles regardless of what permissions you give them (other than via the network)
19:56:13 <strcat[m]> that's what profiles are: isolated workspaces, with their own shared data (such as their own home directory, contacts, etc.) and apps can only communicate with mutual consent within a profile
19:56:15 <strcat[m]> not across them
19:56:32 <strcat[m]> and apps are installed separately within each profile
19:56:35 <ultracard[m]> wow
19:56:36 <ultracard[m]> impressive
19:56:37 <ultracard[m]> amazing
19:56:40 <ultracard[m]> thanks
19:56:46 <ultracard[m]> i love that
19:57:07 <ultracard[m]> so excited, gonna go ahead and install graphene os right now
19:57:20 <strcat[m]> it's a separate installation of the app - although for efficiency the OS shares the actual apk installation across them (so updating an app in one profile updates it for all profiles - which is safe due to the OS pinning signing keys and preventing downgrades for apps in general)
19:57:35 <strcat[m]> this is just how user profiles work in AOSP
19:57:44 <dazinism> ultracard: it can keep running in a different profile, but will only have access to data from that profile.
19:57:44 <zugzwang[m]> I read that even vpn on 2nd profile works well
19:57:44 <strcat[m]> although many OEM forks of AOSP disable user profiles
19:58:03 <strcat[m]> ultracard: we enable a non-standard AOSP feature which is being able to explicitly logout of profiles
19:58:18 <strcat[m]> ultracard: each profile has a separate disk encryption key based on the authentication method of that profile
19:58:28 <strcat[m]> and when you logout of a profile it becomes fully at rest as if you rebooted (for that profile)
19:58:43 <dazinism> You can log out of the profile and that will shut it down. If you are in a different profile, you wont get notifications from it.
19:58:46 <strcat[m]> can't logout of the main "Owner" profile since it handles things other profiles require (to do that, you reboot)
19:58:53 <ultracard[m]> wow, omg i love graphene
19:59:13 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "You can log out of the profile a"> nice, wouldn't want notifications from whatsapp anyways
19:59:16 <strcat[m]> the only things we change about user profiles from AOSP are increasing the limit from 4 to 16 and enabling logout
19:59:27 <strcat[m]> logout plays really well with how per-profile encryption works
19:59:37 <strcat[m]> and AOSP supports properly purging keys from hardware / memory now
19:59:53 <strcat[m]> (hardware as in the CPU crypto acceleration registers etc)
20:00:21 <zugzwang[m]> <strcat[m] "logout plays really well with ho"> If i remember correctly you couldnt log out of profile on android 10?
20:00:36 <strcat[m]> zugzwang: logout is a feature we enabled downstream
20:00:56 <strcat[m]> zugzwang: AOSP 11 doesn't have a logout option except for device managers that enable it
20:01:10 <ultracard[m]> so i do not have to worry about whatsapp collecting or using my data (except for the data it collects when i'm using the app) while i am logged into a different user where whatsapp is not installed?
20:01:13 <strcat[m]> we just set it to be available as a standard UI feature without needing a device manager - really minimal change
20:01:30 <strcat[m]> ultracard: you don't have to worry about it other than CPU timing side channel attacks, etc.
20:01:40 <strcat[m]> which I'm sure it doesn't do
20:02:16 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "we just set it to be available a"> cool, because on Lineage OS (at least LineageOS 16) that feature is missing
20:02:23 <strcat[m]> just put it in a dedicated profile and if you don't want it running, logout of that profile
20:03:05 <strcat[m]> you can leave it running in the background while you use another profile and the profiles are isolated
20:03:12 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "ultracard: you don't have to wor"> nice, yeah, if whatsapp did something that nefarious and someone would find out they'd be sued to the moon.
20:03:22 <strcat[m]> and profiles that are in the background can't do stuff like recording audio (apps can't record audio in the background anyway)
20:03:32 <strcat[m]> (but there's a separate restriction on profiles as a whole not being able to do that)
20:03:59 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "you can leave it running in the "> if the app running in the background cannot collect data from another users account i don't mind
20:04:07 <zugzwang[m]> If i use orbot always on block other traffic on 2nd profile.  will that effect main profile?
20:04:18 <strcat[m]> yeah it can't do that, user profiles are isolated
20:04:47 <dazinism> ultracard: heres info about what apps can see https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/what-can-apps-see
20:04:51 <strcat[m]> zugzwang: the network connection is shared across profiles essentially
20:04:56 <zugzwang[m]> I searchef on here but its broken threads as element wont show full conversations
20:05:02 <ultracard[m]> except for: if whatsapp can scan for nearby wifi networks in the background that would mean that it can track my location, and i wouldn't want mister zuckerman to know my location
20:05:21 <dazinism> Not sure exactly how having apps is a secndary, backgrounded profile would effect all those
20:05:25 <strcat[m]> ultracard: apps can't see Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cell towers, etc. unless you grant them Location access
20:05:38 <strcat[m]> so if you don't want them tracking location, don't grant Location
20:06:13 <strcat[m]> Location covers seeing nearby Wi-Fi networks, cell towers and scanning for Bluetooth devices, along with using supplementary location services (which we don't have) not just GPS
20:06:21 <strcat[m]> and anyway the "GPS" is really GNSS
20:06:23 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "ultracard: heres info about what"> thanks, sounds interesting
20:06:59 <dazinism> ultracard: also this has info about profiles https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
20:07:36 <zugzwang[m]> <strcat[m] "ultracard: apps can't see Wi-Fi,"> Is it the same on ios?
20:08:10 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "so if you don't want them tracki"> really? I thought google was purposefully misleading users by allowing them to disable location services but not telling them that the app can still find out where they are using wifi/bluetooth
20:08:21 <strcat[m]> ultracard: that's not accurate
20:09:06 <dazinism> strcat: Do you know if apps in secondary profiles have device encrypted components if they would be active before logging into a secondary user?
20:09:07 <strcat[m]> and we don't have Play services anyway
20:09:07 <strcat[m]> but that is not accurate about Play services
20:09:11 <dazinism> logically sounds plausible
20:09:14 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "and anyway the "GPS" is really G"> Iirc GPS is within the modem on Qualcomm devices MPSS
20:09:22 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "ultracard: that's not accurate"> wow, I'm impressed. thanks. didn't think that google would ever surprise me in a positive way regarding privacy
20:09:55 <dazinism> Dont think many apps have device encrypted components though.
20:11:40 <dazinism> Anyone know any apps that do?
20:11:56 <strcat[m]> dazinism: I don't really think secondary profiles can use direct boot because they are inactive
20:12:14 <strcat[m]> dazinism: if you switch to them, before you have unlocked
20:12:17 <strcat[m]> that's the only time they would be active
20:12:28 <strcat[m]> so sure it can work in that case
20:12:33 <strcat[m]> switch to them to make them active and don't actually login
20:12:49 <strcat[m]> dazinism: not really sure secondary users support it that way though
20:12:55 <strcat[m]> they might become active after login
20:12:57 <strcat[m]> you'd need to test
20:13:04 <strcat[m]> I've never had a reason to look at that
20:15:22 <dazinism> Fair. Don't know of any apps that I could test with.
20:17:31 <dazinism> Its unusual for apps to use direct boot.
20:19:22 <clox[m]> Hi, is it good to reboot my grapheneOS ones a day? Or it do not make a different?
20:20:21 <ultracard[m]> thanks guys, realizing that i can still have privacy even when i'm using whatsapp made me smile because it makes me feel like we're not yet completely living in a technological dystopy
20:21:44 <dazinism> clox: yeah its useful. A reboot has kernal & system checked by verified boot and reloaded.
20:22:44 <ultracard[m]> which factory image should i use for my pixel 4a? there is one with OTA and one without
20:22:59 <Uberarchangel> Hi peoples. So i bought a 5 I needed the IPX rating  instead of 4a from the specs the hardware looks extremely similar to 4a would sunfish work on the 5
20:23:58 <dazinism> ultracard: ota is an update
20:24:10 <ultracard[m]> <ultracard[m] "which factory image should i use"> does that mean that the one version of graphene OS does have OTA updates and the other one doesn't or is the zip file wich OTA in it's name an additional file i need to flash if i want to have tha ability to get over the air updates
20:24:25 <ultracard[m]> > <@ultracard:matrix.org> which factory image should i use for my pixel 4a? there is one with OTA and one without
20:24:25 <ultracard[m]>  * does that mean that the one version of graphene OS does have OTA updates and the other one doesn't or is the zip file with OTA in it's name an additional file i need to flash if i want to have tha ability to get over the air updates
20:24:32 <clox[m]> <dazinism "clox: yeah its useful. A reboot "> Thx, dazinism
20:24:51 <ultracard[m]> <Uberarchangel "Hi peoples. So i bought a 5 I ne"> I'm not a developer, but flashing it on the 5 shouldn't work
20:24:54 <ultracard[m]> it has different hardware
20:24:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Uberarchangel "Hi peoples. So i bought a 5 I ne"> No it will not
20:25:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not flash a factory image not meant for your device
20:25:27 <dazinism> Use the OTA files to update if GrapheneOS os already installed
20:25:43 <ultracard[m]> <Uberarchangel "Hi peoples. So i bought a 5 I ne"> you could brick your phone in the process. wait until there's an official release of graphene OS for the pixel6
20:25:45 <Uberarchangel> That is why I came and asked thank you.
20:26:17 <ultracard[m]> > <@freenode_Uberarchangel:matrix.org> Hi peoples. So i bought a 5 I needed the IPX rating  instead of 4a from the specs the hardware looks extremely similar to 4a would sunfish work on the 5
20:26:17 <ultracard[m]>  * you could brick your phone in the process. wait until there's an official release of graphene OS for the pixel5
20:27:02 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "Use the OTA files to update if G"> but I thought that OTA meant "Over The Air" updates, meaning that i don't have to manually download a file to update my phone
20:28:45 <dazinism> Its the same file as is served OTA. Just can download and sideload onto device if for some reason you don't want to connect the device to network, or maybe grapheneos server
20:29:14 <ultracard[m]> <dazinism "Its the same file as is served O"> OK, now i get it. Thanks dazinism. You're amazing
20:29:15 <Uberarchangel> Are there any people looking into the pixel 5 even for alpha/beta.
20:30:21 <dazinism> I didnt realise anyone had a 5 yet
20:30:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Uberarchangel](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_Uberarchangel:matrix.org) not yet
20:31:14 <Uberarchangel> I don't not yet 5ht or 6th is my eta
20:32:37 <dazinism> Actually, if you are up to date and going to the next update you will get a smaller delta OTA via seamless updater
20:32:50 <Dylanger[m]> Is there any more tinkering aside from extracting libs and bins from vendor and cloning the kernel? For the 5
20:33:55 <Uberarchangel> Hrmm that sounds like that could be a fun weekend project
20:35:45 <dazinism> Porting all the grapheneos changes to the device.
20:35:57 <dazinism> Sorting out SELinux policies
20:36:14 <dazinism> Getting Auditor app to work with it
20:36:39 <dazinism> Fixing any bugs uncovered
20:37:16 <Dylanger[m]> I always thought Graphene itself was a GSI
20:37:42 <Dylanger[m]> But I guess GMS embeds itself into vendor
20:37:43 <dazinism> Then needs a maintainer/maintenance team to commit to looking after things for the device lifespan
20:41:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "I always thought Graphene itself"> It isn't
20:41:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos is compiled specifically for a given device
20:41:26 <dazinism> Think most of this is still relevant / current
20:41:29 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
20:41:41 <Uberarchangel> I am still surprised there is that many hardware differences between the 4a and 5
20:42:36 <dazinism> Think 4a5G shares more with the 5.
20:43:35 <Uberarchangel> That is my bad that is what I meant
20:44:30 <Uberarchangel> I would think those 2 could litterally run the same OS build
20:45:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> No they can't
20:47:24 <Uberarchangel> The 4a5g and 5 can't run the same build?
20:48:59 <Uberarchangel> Alright I am going to go thank you for the information gus I will likely be back once I get my phone to talk more
20:49:09 <Uberarchangel> guys*
20:51:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm like
20:51:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fuck you're gonna be back?
21:06:03 <strcat[m]> ultracard: you should follow https://grapheneos.org/install and use the factory images not the OTA
21:06:35 <strcat[m]> the OTA is just shown on the releases page for people who want it for some reason like sideloading it to recovery to update instead of updating via the automatic over-the-air updates
21:07:38 <strcat[m]> the update client in the OS uses the incremental updates (unless you fall behind updates) anyway, not those massive full updates for updating from any past version
21:07:51 <strcat[m]> we just don't bother listing those on the releases page
21:10:38 <Dylanger[m]> Is it worth removing Widevine etc from firmware/NON-HLOSS
21:11:03 <Dylanger[m]> Its still signed, but removing it could remove attack surface?
21:16:53 <Dylanger[m]> It sucks you don't have MRC blown into these devices
21:19:17 <prestocaso[m]> Anyone else having an issue with new pipe. Every video I select throws up a error report
21:24:30 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: Widevine is in TEE which is largely legacy now that there's a proper secure element
21:24:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <prestocaso[m] "Anyone else having an issue with"> Known issue. Everyone is affected
21:24:51 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: so sure with custom hardware wouldn't include it but wouldn't really change anything
21:25:08 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: we can just finish removing support for it in the OS
21:25:14 <strcat[m]> doesn't matter
21:25:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) so I can't watch Netflix on grapheneos phone, sad
21:25:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sarcasm ^
21:25:43 <strcat[m]> I doubt you can anyway
21:25:54 <strcat[m]> I assume their app depends on Play Services and that they try to prevent using a web browser on mobile
21:26:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "I assume their app depends on Pl"> It works
21:26:39 <strcat[m]> the app?
21:26:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll use DRM on vanadium in the browser
21:26:55 <strcat[m]> ah didn't realize they supported it
21:27:04 <strcat[m]> Vanadium (Chromium) just delegates to the OS
21:27:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> * It'll use DRM on vanadium so it does work in the browser
21:27:21 <strcat[m]> the DRM doesn't really do anything
21:27:31 <strcat[m]> I don't really understand how it's supposed to stop anything
21:27:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "Vanadium (Chromium) just delegat"> Glassrom doesn't do DRM. Remember a few months ago I gave you a crash log on how vanadium on glassrom crashed on Netflix because it couldn't find any DRM HALs on the device?
21:28:05 <strcat[m]> ah yeah
21:28:11 <strcat[m]> we need to properly disable it
21:28:17 <strcat[m]> not remove the generic HAL
21:28:25 <strcat[m]> we need to remove the widevine implementation not the generic HAL
21:28:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
21:28:49 <strcat[m]> anyway atm we don't remove per-device functionality like that
21:29:06 <strcat[m]> we just don't include stuff in product like nasty Sprint stuff
21:29:18 <strcat[m]> we include all of the SoC vendor components
21:29:22 <strcat[m]> and widevine is basically part of that
21:29:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW widevine is not just one blob
21:29:50 <strcat[m]> I know
21:30:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's other HALs that get the keys from the hardware and give it to widevine
21:30:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there's clearkey too
21:30:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> And there's also a huge amount of sepolicy that will have to go out
21:31:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember how our isolated app updates in device trees are mostly DRM HAL?
21:31:15 <strcat[m]> the sepolicy doesn't really have to be removed if there is nothing set up that can use it
21:32:06 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't think any Pixels support clearkey just widevine

21:36:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Here's what it'd look like on glassrom
21:44:14 <Dylanger[m]> Has anyone done any side channel fun with Titan M?
21:44:35 <Dylanger[m]> I think it's time to blast some EM at it
21:46:12 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "anyway atm we don't remove per-d"> Wish you guys at MRC, you'd be able to make changes to ABL and XBL
21:46:25 <Dylanger[m]> * Wish you guys had MRC, you'd be able to make changes to ABL and XBL
21:48:12 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: ah so clearkey is just like a fake testing DRM?
21:48:13 <strcat[m]> didn't realize that
21:48:31 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/+/master/drm/mediadrm/plugins/clearkey
21:48:33 <strcat[m]> yeah
21:51:34 <ultracard[m]> hey guys, just installed graphen OS on my google pixel 4a, and it worked. It's still a bit buggy, sometimes i have to tap on an application multiple times to open it, but i guess that's to be expected when installing a rom which is stilll "experimental"
21:52:09 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't ever have to tap multiple times to open something
21:52:16 <strcat[m]> unknown: also make sure to lock it
21:53:15 <mx[m]> Hi I am trying to install on pixel 3a i unlocked but cant execute ./flash-all.sh
21:53:27 <mx[m]> I'm on linux mint
21:53:47 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "unknown: also make sure to lock "> sure, did that
21:53:53 <ultracard[m]> <mx[m] "Hi I am trying to install on pix"> had the same problem
21:54:07 <strcat[m]> probably don't have udev rules to run it as a non-privileged user
21:54:08 <ultracard[m]> my problem was that i was using "sudo ./flash-all.sh"
21:54:20 <ultracard[m]> but if you use sudo, your path variable will be different
21:54:21 <mx[m]> i did with sudo
21:54:28 <ultracard[m]> nice
21:54:34 <ultracard[m]> than we know what the issue was
21:54:36 <ultracard[m]> try without sudo
21:54:48 <ultracard[m]> i also wanted to do it with sudo because i thought that would be safer
21:54:54 <ultracard[m]> but it only works without sudo
21:54:55 <strcat[m]> mx: that won't work if you don't have fastboot accessible there
21:55:08 <strcat[m]> ultracard: using sudo without arguments runs stuff as root...
21:55:13 <strcat[m]> ultracard: opposite of safer
21:55:25 <strcat[m]> although there is no real distinction between a user with access to sudo as root, and root
21:55:27 <mx[m]> I'm on fastboot mode with unlocked state
21:55:57 <strcat[m]> mx: you need to follow https://grapheneos.org/install as it's written there - you can't run flash-all.sh with sudo part of the way through the process
21:56:16 <strcat[m]> if you want to run it as root (rather than getting proper udev rules) you need to do the whole thing that way
21:56:21 <strcat[m]> so you have fastboot there
21:56:33 <mx[m]> yes
21:56:43 <mx[m]> i did step by step
21:56:53 <mx[m]> including verification
21:58:00 <mx[m]> how to check communication between device and terminal
21:58:03 <mx[m]> ?
21:58:41 <mx[m]> I have < waiting for any device> message
22:06:25 <saucy-salamander> mx what OS are you using to install? That sounds like you are not running as root or you haven't set up the udev rules
22:07:09 <saucy-salamander> OK saw you are on Linux Mint
22:07:24 <mx[m]> stable for 3a  sargo-factory-2020.10.23.04
22:07:46 <saucy-salamander> I would just become root (sudo -i) and do the entire process again
22:07:58 <saucy-salamander> So instead of using sudo, do it as root
22:08:13 <mx[m]> OK I will try
22:08:38 <mx[m]> just go into folder and do ./flash-all.sh ?
22:08:52 <mx[m]> or start from fastboot flashing unlock ?
22:09:07 <mx[m]> it is unlocked anyway
22:10:24 <saucy-salamander> <mx[m] "I have < waiting for any device>"> What were you doing when you got this message? Start from there
22:11:10 <mx[m]> I'm in root now in  sargo-factory-2020.10.23.04 and I will try ./flash-all.sh
22:11:54 <coffeebag[m]> which messages you get on your mobile phone screen ?
22:11:54 <mx[m]> same issue stop on < waiting for any device>
22:12:44 <mx[m]> no massage, just fastboot mode
22:13:12 <mx[m]> massage is in terminal
22:13:34 <coffeebag[m]> you should unlock the bootloader
22:14:02 <mx[m]> I did already, do this again?
22:14:44 <mx[m]> i did   fastboot flashing unlock and have same massage again
22:14:49 <mx[m]>  < waiting for any device>
22:14:55 <coffeebag[m]> come private
22:15:59 <coffeebag[m]> i pm you
22:16:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> <coffeebag[m] "come private"> Lewd
22:19:33 <Dylanger[m]> Does Graphene change any of the modem's NV?
22:22:16 <Dylanger[m]> Also does anyone know if GCam on the Pixel 4 is actually using the Visual Core and not cdsp?
22:28:50 <Dylanger[m]> `vendor/firmware/CAMERA_ICP.elf` has a REX section

22:54:20 <BeingFrey[m]> Hello Good GrapheneOS folks! =)  I am desparately trying to find a Google Maps equivalent.  I've tried OSM and MagicEarth apps but they are not terribly user-friendly.  Suggestions?
23:01:22 <prestocaso[m]> BeingFrey: F-droid provides osmand+ for free which adds a few things
23:02:11 <BeingFrey[m]> <prestocaso[m] "BeingFrey: F-droid provides osma"> Ha.. you're in many rooms/groups I see.
23:02:15 <BeingFrey[m]> Thanks again! =)
23:03:13 <BeingFrey[m]> Which custom ROM do you use?
23:03:36 <prestocaso[m]> No problem the aurora store within fdroid should allow you the install google maps go as well
23:03:54 <BeingFrey[m]> <prestocaso[m] "No problem the aurora store with"> On GrapheneOS?
23:04:09 <mx[m]> Thanks coffeebag. I am on the board with GrapheneOS.
23:04:22 <prestocaso[m]> BeingFrey: graphene at the moment but I've used both
23:04:36 <BeingFrey[m]> <prestocaso[m] "BeingFrey: graphene at the momen"> And your preference?
23:05:01 <coffeebag[m]> np
23:05:03 <coffeebag[m]> !
23:06:27 <prestocaso[m]>  BeingFrey: for my use case Graphene, but considering what you will need it may be different
23:07:20 <BeingFrey[m]> <prestocaso[m] " BeingFrey: for my use case Grap"> Google Maps is extremely hard to beat.
23:07:52 <BeingFrey[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "Google Maps is extremely hard to"> And when you NEED IT, you NEED IT!
23:08:01 <prestocaso[m]> BeingFrey: it is yeah they've clearly put the time into making it unbeatable
23:08:14 <coffeebag[m]> What about CityMapper ?
23:08:33 <coffeebag[m]> depends off your needs but it's a great app when you live in big cities
23:08:34 <BeingFrey[m]> <coffeebag[m] "What about CityMapper ?"> Never hear of it but will certainly look into it.  Thanks! =)
23:08:51 <mx[m]> <BeingFrey[m] "And when you NEED IT, you NEED I"> You need a second phone for G Maps
23:08:58 <prestocaso[m]> Not familiar but I'll look into it
23:09:37 <coffeebag[m]> CityMapper is really strong for public transport, wayyyy better for google map on this point
23:09:52 <prestocaso[m]> I have been able to use g maps go in graphene
23:10:00 <coffeebag[m]> but i never try it on small towns / on the road
23:10:53 <prestocaso[m]> It works through your browser
23:11:47 <BeingFrey[m]> <prestocaso[m] "It works through your browser"> How "private, secure" is it using Google Maps via the browser on GrapheneOS?
23:11:52 <BeingFrey[m]> Are you compromising?
23:12:14 <prestocaso[m]> It doesn't require me to log in
23:12:19 <BeingFrey[m]> Hmm
23:12:32 <BeingFrey[m]> Interesting.. I'll look into it.
23:12:33 <BeingFrey[m]> Thanks!
23:13:23 <BeingFrey[m]> I appreciate all of your insight, feedback and suggestions folks!  Unfortunately, I need to leave now for an appointment!  All the best to you!
23:13:24 <BeingFrey[m]> Bye for now
