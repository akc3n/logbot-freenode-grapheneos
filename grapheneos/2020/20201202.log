00:59:43 <jayell[m]> thanks lia. you gave me alot of reading to do. later ill keep digging. does anyone understand the mechanism by which the phone app displays or not displays the 4th 'voicemail' tab. unlike issue 356 i do not even have that tab visible.
02:02:31 <Brambe> my pixel 3 doesn't pick up my wired earbuds

02:06:41 <rny> grapheneos highlight feature yo!
02:09:48 <Brambe> also is there any way too install google hangouts?
02:11:11 <rny> Brambe: strong play dependency, so no :(
02:11:26 <Brambe> Yeah thought so
02:12:00 <rny> follow Dylanger[m]'s microG PR, maybe you can when that's accepted.
02:12:24 <rny> Brambe: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/50
02:12:35 <Lia[m]> <rny "follow Dylanger[m]'s microG PR, "> Don't think it is ready for merging yet
02:13:18 <Lia[m]> (Well, str(cat) said it here some time ago)
02:13:51 <rny> is it just rebase?
02:16:14 <Dylanger[m]> Currently the PR allows for user/standard microG being installed
02:16:20 <Dylanger[m]> With everything working
02:16:31 <Lia[m]> No sig spoofing?
02:16:43 <Dylanger[m]> It's sig spoofing
02:16:47 <Dylanger[m]> You just dont
02:16:54 <rny> still sig spoof, but the generalised permission model got removed
02:16:59 <Dylanger[m]>  * You just don't need to give it the perm
02:17:10 <Lia[m]> <Dylanger[m] "You just dont"> Wait, just on microG right? And the permissions gone too?
02:17:10 <rny> so other apps cant get the sig spoofing capability
02:17:48 <Lia[m]> <rny "so other apps cant get the sig s"> Figures. Not the lead dev, but usually it takes some testing and reviewing before it gets merged
02:18:03 <Lia[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/28
02:18:03 <Lia[m]> Like this one, has been for months, yet still not merged. Not sure why
02:18:19 <Dylanger[m]> But Daniel has set some more requirements, a few months out I'd say
02:18:55 <Lia[m]> <Dylanger[m] "But Daniel has set some more req"> Ah, I see üòÖ
02:20:10 <Lia[m]> No rush though, kudos to the devs of GrapheneOS
02:57:00 <dumbbot> Hello all, I am new to GrapheneOS.... I have a quick question about the necessity to lock the bootloader again after installation
02:57:17 <dumbbot> Is that necessary?
02:58:06 <dumbbot> I don't want to lose functionality.  I will not be installing Gapps and will be using F-Droid
02:58:40 <jayell[m]> see the install page
02:58:55 <jayell[m]> Locking the bootloader is important as it enables full verified boot. It also prevents using fastboot to flash, format or erase partitions. Verified boot will detect modifications to any of the OS partitions (vbmeta, boot/dtbo, product, system, vendor) and it will prevent reading any modified / corrupted data. If changes are detected, error correction data is used to attempt to obtain the original data at which point
02:58:55 <jayell[m]> it's verified again which makes verified boot robust to non-malicious corruption.
03:00:03 <jayell[m]> from graphe.org of course
03:06:47 <dumbbot> jayell[m] : would there be any loss in fundtionality?
03:07:29 <dumbbot> Also. I don't see prebuilt images on github
03:08:04 <dumbbot> Where can I get a precompliled .zip pf GrapheneOS?
03:08:12 <rny> dumbbot: no, why would that happen
03:08:32 <rny> if you follow the key generation step/installation steps correctly, it should boot fine
03:08:46 <rny> dumbbot: https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel

08:56:58 <besamim5781[m]> Hello, do notifications in Vanadium PWAs work?
09:19:20 <strcat[m]> besamim5781: yes, if they use non-FCM push
09:19:48 <strcat[m]> besamim5781: it's not really about Vanadium but rather lack of Play services, Chrome on GrapheneOS would be the same
09:20:07 <strcat[m]> Vanadium doesn't actually remove support for FCM right now but it depends on the OS providing it and it doesn't
12:02:16 <a4ve3ryl1e3e3t7[> Hi
13:49:47 <besamim5781[m]> <strcat[m] "besamim5781: yes, if they use no"> Thanks for the info. Tutanota PWA does not send notifications although the app itself is GSF independent
14:16:03 <graphosy[m]> Hi all, I was wondering how does Bluetooth scanning exposes the phone identity to allow tracking? For example, if my Bluetooth on GOS is almost always on, can devices track which Bluetooth phones are around with some kind of an ID? And then see that I left and came back again since it's the same ID? Or is more like the WIFI randomized MAC address?
14:29:56 <strcat> graphosy[m]: it works essentially how Wi-Fi does
14:30:36 <strcat> but it accounts for needing to rotate the identifier when remaining connected to a device
14:30:41 <strcat> unlike Wi-Fi
15:13:23 <graphosy[m]> <strcat "but it accounts for needing to r"> How does that work?
15:13:52 <graphosy[m]> <graphosy[m] "How does that work?"> What is exposed to the devices around me?
15:35:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: BT MAC is randomized?
15:39:26 <strcat[m]> my response covers that
15:40:38 <strcat[m]> graphosy: anupritaisno1: if you want more details, I suggest reading about it from posts covering it in detail
15:43:23 <strcat[m]> it's not specific to GrapheneOS
16:12:36 <graphosy[m]> <strcat[m] "graphosy: anupritaisno1: if you "> How can we find it?
16:15:42 <strcat> can't teach you how to do research, sorry
16:15:51 <strcat> I gave an answer above, if you want more details there's lots of information available
16:16:01 <strcat> the same question I answered is being asked in different ways - refer to my response above
16:16:25 <strcat> 09:29:56          @strcat | graphosy[m]: it works essentially how Wi-Fi does
16:16:26 <strcat> 09:30:36          @strcat | but it accounts for needing to rotate the identifier when remaining connected to a device
16:16:28 <strcat> 09:30:41          @strcat | unlike Wi-Fi
16:17:01 <strcat> if you aren't satisfied with that level of information, you'll need to do your own research, I'm not going to write an essay on Bluetooth here
16:17:26 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/usage#wifi-privacy
16:17:28 <strcat[m]> apply what I said there
16:17:30 <strcat[m]> that's your answer
16:28:37 <brenneke[m]> graphosy: If you are using Element there is a search feature.
16:41:02 <somenerd[m]> yeah
16:52:41 <Zyansheep[m]1> How might I go about integrating the F-Droid PrivilegedExtension with GrapheneOS?
16:53:58 <Zyansheep[m]1> on here https://android.izzysoft.de/articles/named/fdroid-intro-2 you are supposed to flash it with twrp but will that prevent me from relocking the bootloader?
16:58:07 <drg-developer[m]> Hi! Does anybody know where the sensor acces feature is in de source code of grapheneOS?
17:01:15 <Aldous[m]> Snapdragon 888 is the first mobile processor to have the hability to be a used as an hypervisor .... It's good new for grapheneOS to implement more security like qubesos does !!! üòç
17:04:06 <Zyansheep[m]1> wait nvm I found it https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/f3xuy5/fdroid_privileged_extension/
17:23:10 <arrebol[m]> Hi all, I have GOS installed in a Pixel4a, and sometimes I get a software reboot. I cannot reproduce it and I would like to get logs and see if I can get more information about what is happening. Can someone tell me how can which logs I should get? Logcat is just giving me last records and I haven't been able to get error messages from this log. Any other log source that I can check ?
17:54:43 <blacklight447[m]> I wonder how trustworthy the encryption over bluetooth is
17:55:06 <blacklight447[m]> Assuming both the phone and bluetooth device support the lastest bluetooth version
17:56:52 <strcat[m]> Aldous: that's not true, existing Snapdragon SoCs have virtualization support
17:57:09 <strcat[m]> drg-developer: frameworks/base, frameworks/native and packages/apps/Settings
17:57:25 <drg-developer[m]> Thanks!
17:57:31 <strcat[m]> arrebol: you should be able to get logcat logs, just find the relevant context
17:57:59 <strcat[m]> btw, I added an atom feed for the release changelog: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/abc83cbed6ebba15b5fc5a6f4f9524bb7e04db19
17:59:56 <drg-developer[m]> Strcat: since you seem to know your stuff, do you know where the "start" command looks for services? For example: i got a root shell, and when i type " start  bootanim" my phone starts the boot animation. But the bootanimatioj executable is named "bootanimation" under /bin.
18:01:32 <strcat[m]> https://feedly.com/i/discover/sources/search/feed/https%3A%2F%2Fgrapheneos.org%2Freleases.atom%3F2
18:01:34 <strcat[m]> seems to work properly
18:02:17 <njha[m]> Anyone have ideas for how to debug a malloc issue? StreetComplete consistently crashes on startup and the error is something to do with memory allocation
18:02:45 <njha[m]> So it would have to be a grapheneos specific thing right?
18:02:46 <strcat[m]> probably a memory corruption bug in the app
18:02:53 <strcat[m]> njha: no
18:02:59 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is just uncovering the memory corruption bug
18:03:05 <strcat[m]> it happens elsewhere
18:03:27 <njha[m]> makes sense
18:03:52 <strcat[m]> drg-developer: `start` is for starting an init service
18:04:07 <strcat[m]> drg-developer: look at system/core
18:04:24 <drg-developer[m]> Can i just treat it as regular linux init?
18:04:28 <strcat[m]> the `start` code is in `toolbox/start.cpp` there
18:04:30 <drg-developer[m]> (Or openRC)
18:04:36 <strcat[m]> unsure what you mean by that
18:04:50 <drg-developer[m]> Well, the inner working of init
18:04:58 <strcat[m]> it's Android's init system
18:05:01 <JTL> yeah, only reason I can see to handle init services manually is for developemnt/debugging
18:05:02 <strcat[m]> it's not something from somewhere else
18:05:42 <drg-developer[m]> Well, thanks! I think i'll figure it our from here
18:05:52 <strcat[m]> only low-level core system stuff is done with the low-level init system
18:06:09 <strcat[m]> also it's what manages the system properties
18:06:18 <strcat[m]> which is a low-level key-value database
18:06:47 <drg-developer[m]> Well, i just like understanding a lot, and the bootup system is quite an important piece. Since i messed arround with linux init systems quite a bit, i thought it'd be fun with android init system too
18:07:24 <strcat[m]> drg-developer: well look at system/core/init, the init configuration files for it in system/core/rootdir, etc.
18:07:44 <strcat[m]> it implements an equivalent to udev itself (ueventd)
18:09:24 <strcat[m]> drg-developer: rootdir/ueventd.rc is the configuration for that, and then there's a uevent.hardware.rc for hardware (and similarly hardware-specific init scripts)
18:09:30 <strcat[m]> can find those in the device repos
18:09:52 <strcat[m]> it's a pretty simple event-based init system
18:09:56 <drg-developer[m]> Well, i got to tell a secret: i use lineageOS
18:10:25 <strcat[m]> system properties are a key-value database for small string keys / values used to do very low-level global system configuration
18:10:31 <strcat[m]> init manages that
18:10:42 <drg-developer[m]> So init dir is under /system/etc/init ( i found by find . | grep init)
18:11:02 <drg-developer[m]> but there are a lot of .rc files there, so i think it;s the right directory
18:11:18 <njha[m]> Looks like the upstream library author rewrote some of the memory management code 5 days ago
18:11:33 <njha[m]> Maybe if I just update that and rebuild ü§û
18:12:00 <strcat[m]> njha: which library?
18:12:36 <strcat[m]> also it's likely ASan will uncover whatever is wrong if the component doing it is built with it
18:12:55 <strcat[m]> and that is easier to debug since it's a debugging tool with complex tracking of state and complex error output code

18:36:08 <obi[m]> People get that error because they installed the tools from the outdated repository

18:37:37 <helpmeplease12> i uninstalled fastboot and re-downloaded it from that site
18:37:58 <obi[m]> are u on windows then?

18:49:32 <helpmeplease12> Sample output from fastboot --version afterwards:
18:49:47 <helpmeplease12> Is this where it shuold be installed
18:51:59 <obi[m]> after getting tools down, you just literally make sure your screen looks like th instrcutions say, and hit the enter button. Just have to have this in your shell before hitting enter, that is all $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
