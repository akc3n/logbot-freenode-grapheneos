02:47:50 <Freedom18> Ok. I just loaded graphene the other day without issue but found anything other then "Preferred Network Type = 3G" indicates there is no network
02:48:54 <entry1[m]> What carrier is it? Sprint or Boost? That's odd
02:49:58 <Freedom18> Sprint SIM card
02:51:46 <Freedom18> I've tested Safe Mode, modifying multiple settings, rebooting, and multiple re-activations.
02:56:35 <entry1[m]> That's frustrating. Is Sprint best for your area? I'm not trying to avoid the troubleshooting as someone else may be able to help, but I was just wondering if there is a reason you are sticking with Sprint versus with a T-Mobile line
03:01:03 <Freedom18> Running a legacy Unlimited contract but sounds like it would be worth looking into a T-Mobile SIM. Especially as they are the same company now
03:08:00 <entry1[m]> Would highly recommend it. Do you need unlimited data? Mint Mobile (T-Mobile) is running a promo now. 35gb/mo for $30/mo. They are also giving 3 free months for a 3 month purchase. No contracts and you can buy a mint mobile starter kit sim for $2 on eBay to test it out prior.
03:08:22 <entry1[m]> They work great with GrapheneOS
03:09:50 <louipc> entry1[m]: do u have reflink
03:14:59 <entry1[m]> Like their site's URL or my referral link? I'm not trying to get anything for free from him signing up
03:17:20 <Freedom18> Ah... should have done more research. Stumbled across a reddit comment by DanielMicay
03:17:38 <Freedom18> big oof on my part

10:53:45 <mraucklander[m]> Furthermore consumers are not strictly under that classification. They should not be treated the same.
10:54:35 <Lia[m]> I mean, the only discouragement being told here is to expect Samsung w/ "GrapheneOS" to be private and secure as the official builds.
10:54:51 <Lia[m]> Unlocked bootloader already throws this out of the window
10:55:29 <Lia[m]> I'm only saying ideally we won't have to do that much to obtain privacy and security,and have it out of the box?
10:55:59 <mraucklander[m]> It makes sense.
10:56:26 <Lia[m]> Agreed on that one, they aren't all the same. Only saying that not all consumers or potential devs should waste their time porting GrapheneOS on Samsung

13:33:24 <graphiteos[m]> yeah I already know the things on the homepage. I was looking for documentation from google about the titan M chip what functions it has, supported crypto algorithms how it implements Android KeyStore or Android TEE
13:38:13 <graphiteos[m]> also is ther epublic reasoning from google why they include the titan M instead of using the Quallcom TEE includes in the Snapdragon 730G for example ( I know that ARM TrustZone is a different design from a dedicated copressesor Im interested in first party sources)
13:52:25 <jpds> graphiteos[m]: Probably better to look through https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan
13:53:09 <somenerd[m]> I think that's unrelated
13:53:13 <somenerd[m]> to the Titan M
14:07:40 <graphiteos[m]> yeah seems so. Probably just uses a similar name because google is also part of it

14:33:40 <hmn> Thank you my friend, Have a great Sunday!
14:33:50 <Golli[m]> You too.
14:47:12 <Lia[m]> Good thing this is a nonissue (?) for GrapheneOS, <a href="https://teddit.net/r/netsec/comments/jnt2qp/detecting_dynamic_loading_in_android_applications/">dynamic loading in apps</a>
14:49:03 <Lia[m]> <a href="grapheneos.org/features">Prevention of dynamic native code execution in-memory or via the filesystem for the base OS without going via the package manager, etc.</a>
16:16:20 <strcat[m]> graphiteos: TEE is not a secure element, and it's not comparable to one, you should do more research first - the comparison is between the Qualcomm SPU and the Titan M, the Titan M has lower attack surface and additional features like a secure timer for Weaver
16:18:50 <strcat> graphiteos[m]: TEE is not comparable to either, it's not a secure element ('security chip'), it's an execution mode on the same CPU, has drastically higher attack surface, has privileges over the non-TEE mode (it's meant for stuff like monitoring the non-TEE mode)
16:19:04 <strcat> doesn't have internal secure storage like a secure element
16:19:46 <strcat> so for example stuff like the GPU, radios, SPU, etc. are separate chips within the same package, essentially
16:19:51 <strcat> TEE is just a mode of the CPU
16:20:17 <strcat> having the chips in the same package doesn't make them inherently less isolated just saves money and reduces latency
16:20:43 <strcat> an alternate mode of CPU execution is certainly less isolated, especially when it has so much attack surface
16:26:43 <graphiteos[m]> yes I understand that. What I meant is. That you can implement KeyStore for example sing TEE (ARM TrustZone) isnt that correct?
16:28:28 <strcat> graphiteos[m]: only the traditional legacy keystore
16:28:38 <strcat> the more secure, modern StrongBox keystore requires a secure element
16:28:46 <strcat> legacy keystore can be phased out now
16:29:10 <graphiteos[m]> Ah ok, thx
16:29:15 <strcat> graphiteos[m]: Pixels aren't the only phone with a secure element, and again the comparison for that is between SPU and Titan M
16:29:26 <strcat> Titan M has secure timer and lower attack surface
16:29:33 <strcat> SPU is only used on Pixels for eSIM
16:31:51 <graphiteos[m]> can you reccomend some ressources on the topic?
19:13:15 <ChristopherPrime> Did anybody take a look at the XDA Phone the pro 1x? I like the concept, but don't really understand why they aren't building a phone which is secure as the pixel ones or better but not supporting big tec Google.
19:18:04 <cyborgninjaneer[> I've never known XDA to be particularly security-conscious. For example, LineageOS doesn't allow you to lock your bootloader.
19:21:11 <ChristopherPrime> I always thought they are. Sad to hear that 😐
19:21:11 <ChristopherPrime> They could work all together on a great alternative. I think the demand in privacy will get bigger and bigger nowadays.
19:38:20 <graphiteos[m]> its just a rebranded old phone

20:40:17 <lordofthehodl[m]> hello
20:41:57 <lordofthehodl[m]> I am looking to install graphene os on a google pixel4a just wondering if this os can download mobile bitcoin wallets?
20:42:58 <Golli[m]> It can.
20:46:01 <brenneke[m]> Coinomi works for me.
20:54:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hello lordofthehodl[m], you can download Mycelium, Electrum, or what have you.
20:54:49 <TheJollyRoger> Those are both tested and working, although you will need to keep them up to date yourself if you sideload them via the official website.
20:55:39 <TheJollyRoger> They're signed and verified and GrapheneOS strictly enforces certificate validation as does Standard Android, so once you've verified the first install, subsequent updates will automatically be checked and verified against the previous.
20:59:16 <TheJollyRoger> lordofthehodl[m]: the safest way at the moment to use bitcoin wallets is to, if you have a direct web of trust connection to the application developers, download and verify the apks from the official website, verify them against your authenticated and validated signing keys (that, I leave to you to discover how to do), then sideload them, and then each time they need to be updated, simply
20:59:17 <TheJollyRoger> download the update from the website. As is standard for Android's security policies, if updated versions of the app don't contain a certificate that matches the previous one or has been validated by a previous one and a valid signature for it, GrapheneOS will refuse to install updates.
21:37:04 <hypokeimenon[m]> Wish I could save messages
21:42:49 <lordofthehodl[m]> TheJollyRoger these wallets are only downloadable as an apk file correct I have not used graphene yet so Im not aware on how this os works if theres a 3rd party appp store or not

21:49:41 <ultracard[m]> Hello, GrapheneOs community. I just installed the newest update of GrapheneOS on my pixel4a via OTA updates. and now my phone is stuck in a bootloop.
21:50:38 <ultracard[m]> after installing the update, I rebooted. everything worked as usual, I unlocked my phone. But then the home screen appeared, but without Icons. I could only see the status bar and the navigation bar
21:50:51 <ultracard[m]> and no matter what i did, the screen was frozen
21:51:08 <ultracard[m]> so i hit the power button for 10 seconds
21:51:26 <ultracard[m]> and now my pixel 4a is stuck booting
21:51:41 <ultracard[m]> when I turn it on, the "GrapheneOS" boot animation appears
21:52:01 <ultracard[m]> but no matter how long I wait, It is stuck booting
21:54:52 <ultracard[m]> could anyone help me,  I'd be grateful for any support
22:00:07 <JeremiahK[m]> uh oh.. now i'm afraid to reboot.
22:00:38 <ultracard[m]> yeah, I wouldn't do it until other users have reported on whether they're experiencing the same issue
22:01:24 <louipx> you on beta or stable?
22:01:30 <ultracard[m]> stable
22:02:09 <ultracard[m]> I hope there is a way to get my data back. I know, It's my fault that I didn't backup my data, but on graphene I have no easy solution like TWRP
22:02:13 <nscnt> No issue here. If the update failed in some way, your system should rollback after 3 or so reboots
22:02:28 <nscnt> Not sure what happened
22:02:41 <ultracard[m]> ooooooh, nice
22:02:50 <ultracard[m]> ok, then I'll try to reboot again
22:02:59 <ultracard[m]> even though i already rebooted at least 3x
22:03:27 <ultracard[m]> after about 10 minutes I always hit the power button for 10secs
22:03:29 <ultracard[m]> should I wait longer?
22:03:49 <nscnt> Well, I mean if it's not able to boot because of it. I think it tries to reboot by itself if such an issue arises. I'm not sure whether that's your case
22:04:33 <ultracard[m]> I haven't noticed it rebooting by itself
22:04:48 <ultracard[m]> the google logo hasn't appeared multiple times
22:04:58 <ultracard[m]> it only stays on the "GrapheneOS" loading screen
22:06:27 <nscnt> I'm not sure and don't know how I could help, sorry
22:06:59 <ultracard[m]> no need to apologize, you trying to help me is already very kind
22:07:15 <ultracard[m]> but maybe some of the developers have an Idea what I could do
22:07:38 <r0tt0r[m]> <ultracard[m] "Hello, GrapheneOs community. I j"> its the 12 12 03 update?
22:08:02 <r0tt0r[m]> beta channel?
22:08:15 <nscnt> stable, he said
22:08:16 <ultracard[m]> I cannot say, I didn't pay attention to the version number.
22:08:32 <ultracard[m]> today I just got a message saying:
22:08:35 <ultracard[m]> "please reboot your phone to apply updates"
22:08:49 <r0tt0r[m]> <nscnt "stable, he said"> oh ok
22:08:50 <ultracard[m]> but i suppose i was installing an update released today on the stable channel
22:09:15 <ultracard[m]> because i have set it to auto download updates as soon as available
22:10:01 <r0tt0r[m]> i always feared to encounter such issue
22:10:03 <nscnt> You have been with enough battery?
22:10:27 <ultracard[m]> battery shouldn't be an issue
22:10:38 <ultracard[m]> I think i had 65% left when installing the update
22:10:43 <nscnt> Yea, just a thought
22:10:47 <ultracard[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "i always feared to encounter suc"> yeah, same here
22:11:17 <ultracard[m]> because since the boot loader is locked i have no idea how to fix the problem myself
22:11:18 <r0tt0r[m]> <ultracard[m] "yeah, same here"> i would wait for devs advice
22:11:29 <JeremiahK[m]> can you get into a recovery mode to pull your data off via a cable?
22:11:34 <ultracard[m]> yep, I won't do anything to the phone until a dev gives me some device
22:11:41 <ultracard[m]> <JeremiahK[m] "can you get into a recovery mode"> yes I can
22:11:43 <nscnt> I think I would just turn it off, let it sit for a while and try booting it later again... just for the sake of it
22:11:56 <ultracard[m]> <nscnt "I think I would just turn it off"> already tried
22:11:56 <r0tt0r[m]> <ultracard[m] "yep, I won't do anything to the "> device or advice? :)
22:11:58 <JeremiahK[m]> well that's a plus, incase you do need to reflash
22:12:05 <ultracard[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "device or advice? :)"> didn't change anything
22:12:13 <ultracard[m]> <JeremiahK[m] "well that's a plus, incase you d"> nice
22:12:21 <JeremiahK[m]> hopefully someone can help you get it sorted though
22:12:26 <ultracard[m]> haha
22:12:30 <ultracard[m]> i mean advice
22:12:37 <ultracard[m]> but i wouldn't mind a device
22:12:40 <r0tt0r[m]> ;)
22:13:03 <anguishedone[m]> https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensors-off
22:13:35 <anguishedone[m]> I just discovered this today; Unfortunately you need to keep developer options enabled or else the quick tile for Sensors Off disapears as well.
22:13:46 <anguishedone[m]> And I assume the setting itself is reverted >.>
22:14:23 <r0tt0r[m]> <anguishedone[m] "I just discovered this today; Un"> ye already knew, i use the sensor permission as certain apps need sensors to work fe. camera
22:15:13 <nscnt> anguishedone[m]: GrapheneOS implemented a Sensor permission for apps. You don't need Developer options
22:15:21 <anguishedone[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "ye already knew, i use the senso"> Apparently the mic remains functional but all that is returned is silence; I wonder if that was done intentionally...
22:17:16 <cyborgninjaneer[> <anguishedone[m] "Apparently the mic remains funct"> Probably - apps might act up if it didn't do that.
22:17:41 <nscnt> Microphone has its own permission
22:18:53 <ultracard[m]> <JeremiahK[m] "hopefully someone can help you g"> yeah, luckily i got a second phone, until my pixel is running again, I'll just use the other one
22:19:01 <ultracard[m]> would be nice though to get my data back
22:19:16 <ultracard[m]> i have a lot of stuff for university on there which i didn't back up
22:21:05 <nscnt> GrapheneOS has a Sensors permission, but it's granted by default because there's no way for apps to ask for this permission and you may run into compatibility issues if denied
22:26:02 <nscnt> anguishedone[m]: You disabled the sensors with developer options, of course you can expect to be reverted if you disable the options. But you're not using the permission GrapheneOS implemented. That's another thing
22:28:18 <nscnt> There shouldn't be a need to change anything in Developer options if you don't need it for actual development
22:28:22 <anguishedone[m]> <nscnt "anguishedone: You disabled the s"> Do you think it would be possible for an individual to add the Sensors Off toggle as a Non Developer option?
22:29:08 <strcat[m]> developer options are for app and OS developers
22:29:25 <strcat[m]> the purpose of features like that is testing things
22:29:30 <anguishedone[m]> I know that, I also know we're supposed to disable it after finishing the install of Graphene OS
22:30:14 <nscnt> anguishedone[m]: Press and hold on the icon of your app > Press the (i) > Permissions > Sensors and you may disable it for this app
22:31:17 <strcat[m]> you can use the permission manager in Settings to browse by permission instead of app
22:32:23 <nscnt> Settings > Apps & notifications > (Advanced) > Permission manager
22:35:08 <r0tt0r[m]> <nscnt "There shouldn't be a need to cha"> reduce wifi search -reduce battery.usage.and advance mac randomisation on every network change is quiet useful settings
22:35:39 <nscnt> strcat[m]: ultracard[m] 's phone doesn't boot after rebooting for the update. Maybe you've got some time for support as I don't know how to help :/
22:35:44 <r0tt0r[m]> * reduce wifi search -reduce battery usage and advance mac randomisation on every network change is quiet useful settings
22:36:24 <strcat[m]> ultracard: please don't advise people not to update because of an issue specific to your phone, probably from a hardware failure
22:36:37 <ultracard[m]> ok, sorry
22:36:47 <ultracard[m]> just wanted to help
22:36:47 <nscnt> r0tt0r[m]: MAC randomisation on every network change is implemented by GrapheneOS, too. No Dev options needed
22:36:55 <ultracard[m]> but i guess i was unqualified for that
22:37:42 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure why you're saying there's no easy backup implementation
22:37:59 <ultracard[m]> you mean because of seedvault?
22:38:05 <ultracard[m]> i use seedvault
22:38:09 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you're misusing developer options that exist for testing and *do not do what you expect*
22:38:13 <ultracard[m]> but it doesn't backup all of my data
22:38:24 <strcat[m]> you have to backup the home directory yourself
22:38:30 <ultracard[m]> only about 1/3rd of my apps were compatible
22:38:40 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "you have to backup the home dire"> yeah taht would be an option
22:38:51 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: strongly recommend turning off those unsupported options, they do not do what you expect
22:39:03 <strcat[m]> you put your privacy and security at risk by using unsupported developer options that you don't understand
22:39:18 <strcat[m]> there is no better form of MAC randomization available via developer options
22:39:20 <r0tt0r[m]> oh
22:39:26 <r0tt0r[m]> thx
22:39:31 <strcat[m]> there's an unsupported, broken thing being used for upstream testing
22:39:38 <strcat[m]> and it isn't useful / needed for GrapheneOS
22:39:58 <r0tt0r[m]> ok didnt know.
22:40:20 <strcat[m]> nscnt: there's no rollback after the point that it has successfully booted and marked the new update as successful
22:40:36 <strcat[m]> does not sound like there were any issues with the update anyway
22:40:55 <ultracard[m]> but why isn't my phone booting then?
22:40:56 <strcat[m]> sounds like it successfully booted up but failed to finish booting due to a storage failure
22:41:08 <ultracard[m]> or is the problem that i am not waiting long enough?
22:41:08 <strcat[m]> hardware failure, sounds like the SSD started having I/O errors
22:41:17 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "nscnt: there's no rollback after"> i thought maybe as a/b device that could be reverting to set other partition as active
22:41:29 <strcat[m]> force turning it off probably wasn't a good idea because it isn't working well enough to boot
22:41:37 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: this is covered in the documentation
22:41:46 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: there is rollback, it doesn't work as you seem to think
22:42:05 <strcat[m]> once you've successfully booted up a new version of the OS, it cannot roll back, that would be incredibly broken and would lead to data corruption / loss
22:42:17 <ultracard[m]> oh no
22:42:30 <strcat[m]> lots of bad information being given
22:42:54 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you can't just take data from v12 of software and use it with v11 safely
22:43:04 <nscnt> I never meant anything else
22:43:08 <r0tt0r[m]> waited for your advice on this, therefor didnt say anything
22:43:10 <strcat[m]> not how software development works, it remains backwards compatible with old data, but the old version of software can't handle a new version of it
22:43:29 <ultracard[m]> makes sense
22:43:39 <strcat[m]> A/B updates roll back when the new upgrade fails to boot - which didn't happen here, it was already tested by a lot of people on the same hardware and worked fine
22:43:44 <ultracard[m]> but is there a way to get my files from internal storage back?
22:43:49 <strcat[m]> and based on the description of the issue, ultracard's device booted the new update just fine
22:43:54 <strcat[m]> it was successful
22:43:56 <ultracard[m]> yeah
22:44:03 <strcat[m]> the issue was not the new version of the OS
22:44:04 <ultracard[m]> but then it freezed
22:44:10 <ultracard[m]> an i couldn't do anything
22:44:27 <strcat[m]> yeah it sounds like a hardware failure likely triggered by the large amount of writes for the update and then the large amount of reads to boot
22:44:30 <strcat[m]> or it could be the CPU overheating
22:44:40 <strcat[m]> whatever happened got worse and now it can't make it as far
22:44:51 <strcat[m]> if it wasn't a hardware issue I don't think it would be worse now than it started initially
22:45:21 <nscnt> oh nvm, I completely missed the part that the device was already booted and unlocked
22:45:56 <strcat[m]> ultracard: check if fastboot mode and recovery mode boot
22:46:02 <strcat[m]> if you can boot into recovery mode that's a good sign
22:46:16 <strcat[m]> if you can't boot into recovery mode, the hardware is definitely broken
22:46:25 <strcat[m]> because it's near stateless
22:47:10 <strcat[m]> ultracard: so if you can boot into recovery mode you could try sideloading the latest update again which will switch back to the other slot - maybe the SSD has partially failed and it can't read the OS
22:47:30 <strcat[m]> although I wouldn't really expect it to help and it might make the failure progress further
22:47:32 <strcat[m]> but I don't really see any other options
22:47:46 <strcat[m]> because if the OS isn't booting you won't be able to use adb or anything
22:47:56 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "if you can boot into recovery mo"> i can boot into recovery mode
22:47:56 <strcat[m]> and also right now adb doesn't properly remember keys persistently due to an upstream bug
22:48:11 <strcat[m]> ultracard: and it works fine?
22:48:18 <strcat[m]> ultracard: when was the last time you updated
22:48:25 <strcat[m]> were you on a recent version already?
22:48:35 <strcat[m]> did you get the initial December upgrade already?
22:48:54 <ultracard[m]> yeah, i was on a recent version already
22:49:03 <ultracard[m]> I always install the latest update as soon as it gets released
22:49:32 <strcat[m]> so you were on 2020.12.08.08 (the initial December update) and it was working fine
22:49:58 <ultracard[m]> I cannot say 100% sure, but i guess yes
22:50:01 <strcat[m]> and then upgrading to the more recent one (2020.12.12.03) was what happened before this problem kicked in
22:50:17 <strcat[m]> ultracard: 2020.12.08.08 was the 1st upgrade in December
22:50:28 <strcat[m]> previous one was 2020.11.27.15
22:50:43 <ultracard[m]> yeah, i installed the one in december
22:51:06 <strcat[m]> we did another upgrade with 3 minor changes which is what you would have installed most recently: connectivity check server changed, SetupWizard overhauled, minor WebView change
22:51:10 <ultracard[m]> and i wasn't experiencing any issues at all
22:51:11 <strcat[m]> none of those things could be a culprit for this
22:51:16 <strcat[m]> and also
22:51:19 <strcat[m]> it's working for everyone else
22:51:23 <ultracard[m]> weird
22:51:29 <strcat[m]> and there's verified boot so we know you have the same install as everyone else
22:51:36 <strcat[m]> bit for bit identical
22:51:47 <strcat[m]> so it sounds to me like hardware failure
22:51:52 <ultracard[m]> but device failure would be insane, do you really think that my device is broken?
22:51:58 <ultracard[m]> physically?
22:51:59 <strcat[m]> but it's hard to identify what kind of hardware failure
22:52:08 <ultracard[m]> i just got it a month ago
22:52:12 <strcat[m]> ultracard: it could be a loose connection or something, it's hard to say
22:52:23 <strcat[m]> ultracard: usually when devices die from a failure, happens quickly, when it's new-ish
22:52:29 <strcat[m]> if it lasts a few months, usually it lasts years
22:52:35 <strcat[m]> just how it tends to be
22:52:39 <ultracard[m]> ahhhh
22:52:41 <ultracard[m]> ok
22:52:45 <ultracard[m]> that sucks
22:52:59 <strcat[m]> ultracard: it's hard to do anything to debug because the OS isn't booting at all
22:53:17 <strcat[m]> trying to think of what can be done other than trying to sideload the latest update again but I don't see any way that's the issue
22:53:24 <strcat[m]> ultracard: does it get *stuck* booting or does it reboot?
22:53:24 <ultracard[m]> but you said that i could try to sideload the update using recovery
22:53:41 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "ultracard: does it get *stuck* b"> it gets stuck booting
22:53:45 <ultracard[m]> it doesn't reboot on it's own
22:53:47 <strcat[m]> that's odd
22:54:01 <strcat[m]> ultracard: does the boot animation continue animating
22:54:06 <strcat[m]> or does it stall
22:54:11 <ultracard[m]> yes
22:54:15 <ultracard[m]> it continues animating forever
22:54:37 <strcat[m]> ultracard: because of what you said before about icons
22:54:45 <strcat[m]> ultracard: it makes it sound like part of the SSD is failing
22:54:51 <strcat[m]> and it's not returning data for that part
22:54:55 <strcat[m]> so it's getting I/O errors
22:54:59 <strcat[m]> so it can load some things but not others
22:54:59 <ultracard[m]> shit
22:55:13 <strcat[m]> it sounds like it was mostly working
22:55:16 <strcat[m]> then it got much worse and couldn't load more
22:55:17 <ultracard[m]> so i'll try sideloading the update using recovery mode
22:55:25 <strcat[m]> yeah I just don't expect that to help
22:55:30 <ultracard[m]> and then i'll report back
22:55:34 <strcat[m]> it seems like the OS is 100% fine, it's some part of the data partition
22:55:36 <strcat[m]> that's not working
22:55:39 <ultracard[m]> yeah, but i guess it's worth a try
22:55:49 <strcat[m]> the OS seems to be passing verified boot / working fine
22:56:01 <strcat[m]> but then it's failing to read data
22:56:09 <ultracard[m]> i mean it would suck if i would lose my data, but it wouldn't be doom
22:56:12 <ultracard[m]> i can recover from that
22:56:34 <ultracard[m]> but do you think that i won't be able to use the device any more at all?
22:56:46 <ultracard[m]> even if i reinstall graphene OS and wipe everything
22:57:10 <ultracard[m]> I'll try sideloading the update tomorrow, gotta go to bed now. got university tomorrok
22:57:10 <strcat[m]> ultracard: it's possible it would work but... without knowing what went wrong, seems risky to use it that way
22:57:34 <ultracard[m]> is such failure covered by my warranty?
22:57:58 <strcat[m]> ultracard: should be but atm it's hard to know exactly what happened
22:58:13 <strcat[m]> really hard to know what happened
22:58:16 <ultracard[m]> because as far as I know google doesn't void your warranty if you install another OS
22:58:28 <strcat[m]> they don't void your warranty
22:58:32 <ultracard[m]> nice
22:58:38 <strcat[m]> and also if it works well enough to flash the stock OS you could do that
22:58:39 <strcat[m]> but
22:58:48 <strcat[m]> seems unclear if it would
22:59:01 <strcat[m]> ultracard: you could try the sideloading thing 1st
22:59:07 <ultracard[m]> yeah
22:59:11 <ultracard[m]> will do that tomorrowk
22:59:14 <strcat[m]> ultracard: unfortunately the next step is probably trying to wipe data - which may or may not work
22:59:32 <ultracard[m]> thanks for your help <3
22:59:40 <r0tt0r[m]> ?if it gets booting after freshflash, is there a way to check the disk for errors?
22:59:46 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "ultracard: unfortunately the nex"> i will report back tomorrow
22:59:50 <strcat[m]> ultracard: and if wiping data *does* appear to work and it boots up after that... it doesn't mean it's fine again
22:59:52 <ultracard[m]> hope i won't have to wipe data
23:00:10 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: there are ways to get logs, etc. that are relevant
23:00:11 <ultracard[m]> <strcat[m] "ultracard: and if wiping data *d"> yeah, that sucks
23:00:30 <ultracard[m]> i should be able to provide logs
23:00:31 <strcat[m]> ultracard: I'd guess that ~3% of hardware fails
23:00:33 <strcat[m]> typical number
23:00:42 <strcat[m]> ultracard: so we have to expect that 3/100 users run into stuff like this
23:00:43 <strcat[m]> which is a lot
23:00:46 <r0tt0r[m]> good reminder for me to do a backup
23:00:53 <ultracard[m]> yeah
23:01:18 <strcat[m]> the 4a might have a higher failure rate than 4 due to cheaper parts including the SSD
23:01:26 <strcat[m]> unclear what happened though
23:01:28 <strcat[m]> it could be the CPU
23:01:48 <strcat[m]> recovery is basically just booting kernel + init + recovery process
23:01:50 <strcat[m]> not much at all
23:02:03 <lordofthehodl[m]> Is graphene available only for google phones?
23:02:20 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
23:06:10 <lordofthehodl[m]> thank you
23:10:33 <Barbelo[m]> is it possible to reliably use the charging port to audio adapter to listen to music wired lol
23:12:12 <strcat[m]> unclear what you're asking
23:12:19 <strcat[m]> there's full support for digital USB-C audio and it works well
23:12:34 <strcat[m]> there's a general purpose USB-C port, not specifically a charging port
23:12:44 <strcat[m]> you don't need an adapter to use it
23:12:56 <strcat[m]> you only need the adapter to convert USB-C digital audio to 3.5mm analog
23:13:15 <Barbelo[m]> idk the usbc never stays in reliably enough to walk around listening to music
23:13:21 <strcat[m]> you could also use any other USB-C DAC directly, including headphones that use USB-C, etc. directly
23:13:43 <strcat[m]> Barbelo: sounds like a defective cable
23:13:57 <strcat[m]> or worn out
23:14:06 <strcat[m]> not sure why that would be a probably, it stays in quite firmly
23:14:13 <strcat[m]>  * not sure why that would be a problem, it stays in quite firmly
23:14:45 <strcat[m]> for each of the phones I have, I could pick them up by the USB-C cable cord and shake them and they won't easily detach
23:15:08 <Barbelo[m]> damn i always had issues with usbc cables lol
23:15:25 <strcat[m]> but, do you, now, with one of these phones?
23:15:28 <strcat[m]> it's not clear what you're asking
23:15:42 <strcat[m]> do you actually have one of the phones and it's a problem? or you're basing this on experience with other things
23:16:10 <strcat[m]> the cables stay in very firmly, it can actually be a problem
23:16:55 <strcat[m]> if the cable gets caught on something can easily fling a phone across a room shrug
