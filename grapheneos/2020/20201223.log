00:26:29 <fakhx[m]> I'm not pulling anything out of thin air i just voiced my concern as some people close to me have been infected with the spyware and i'm trying to educate myself about it and how to protect against it , if you have more info on the subject please enlighten me
00:28:10 <strcat[m]> so you're talking about an old WhatsApp vulnerability?
00:28:24 <strcat[m]> then sure GrapheneOS has hardening to protect against those kinds of exploits, that's what hardened_malloc and other core features do
00:28:39 <strcat[m]> but my suggestion is don't run an old version of WhatsApp, it would be pretty strange to do that
00:28:57 <strcat[m]> maybe you're asking about that kind of attack, but you're framing your question as being about a specific vulnerability they fixed some time ago
00:29:06 <strcat[m]> fakhx: that's from 2019...
00:31:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> fakhx: if you are so concerned then run whatsapp in a separate user profile
00:31:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> And don't put anything else in that profile
00:33:47 <M5upernova[m]> I don't even have WhatsApp on this phone. Commitment phone so this phone with Graphene is my 2nd phone
00:33:59 <M5upernova[m]> * I don't even have WhatsApp on this phone. Commitment phobe so this phone with Graphene is my 2nd phone
00:34:25 <qubits> what is best solution to keep working notifications on apps
00:34:45 <fakhx[m]> https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/technology-55396843
00:34:45 <fakhx[m]> This one from 2 days ago
00:34:45 <fakhx[m]> I've read the citizenlab report as well ,  this time they are talking about ios vulnrabilities but i'm still not sure how pegasus works and wanted to know if android and specifically grapheneos are safe from it thats all
00:39:16 <fakhx[m]> anupritaisno1 5upernova
00:39:17 <fakhx[m]> I havent even installed whatsapp in my new gos phone and hopefully won't but according to the first link i posted pegasus used/uses 0day vulnrabilities at os level so it doesnt matter if whatsapp is used or not (according to that technology writer)
00:39:58 <fakhx[m]> * anupritaisno1
00:39:58 <fakhx[m]> 5upernova
00:39:58 <fakhx[m]> I havent even installed whatsapp in my new gos phone and hopefully won't but according to the first link i posted pegasus used/uses 0day vulnrabilities at os level so it doesnt matter if whatsapp is used or not (according to that technology writer)
00:41:43 <strcat[m]> answered above already
00:41:45 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote above
00:42:51 <strcat[m]> stuff about iOS isn't really relevant to the channel
00:43:00 <fakhx[m]> <qubits "what is best solution to keep wo"> I think it depends on which apps but usually disabling battery optimization fixes the issue , which apps are u talking about anyway ?
00:43:08 <strcat[m]> unless there's something that makes it relevant
00:43:35 <strcat[m]> recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/features and finding better sources of information than mainstream news without expertise on the topics
00:44:17 <qubits> threema work app for example
00:45:27 <strcat[m]> some apps have working push (or use polling) without Play services
00:45:29 <strcat[m]> others don't
00:45:38 <strcat[m]> ask for support from the app developers and complain about it to them
00:46:38 <strcat[m]> you need to take it up with the app developers though, or ask the question in their channels / forums
00:49:01 <grapheneos_user_> Yo I heard copperhead was raiding and trolling this channel-maybe if a troll slips that he works at copperhead, we should let him speak without mocking him. That way we have more evidence on grapheneos side for the lawsuit
00:49:22 <grapheneos_user_> We can screenshot stuff too
00:49:53 <grapheneos_user_> IDK if I'm staying the obvious but I might as well :)
00:49:58 <strcat[m]> we'll just ban them immediately
00:50:04 <strcat[m]> have ample evidence against them already
00:50:27 <strcat[m]> if they want to dig the hole deeper by continuing to have people raid our channels, edit Wikipedia, spread misinformation about us elsewhere, they're just making it worse for themselves
00:50:51 <strcat[m]> they have more than one active sockpuppet account here and we're going to be more promptly banning for concern trolling, etc.
00:51:01 <grapheneos_user_> But didn't you say they do it well? A jury/judge might not see through it
00:51:57 <JS[m]> Lawsuit?
00:52:02 <JS[m]> What happened?
00:53:09 <strcat[m]> JS: there's a malicious company aiming to destroy GrapheneOS
00:53:13 <strcat[m]> which has been attacking it for several years
00:53:16 <strcat[m]> JS: https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1324470375502237696
00:53:29 <qubits> They support polling andworking push without google play services , but when my device is locked with password it doesnt works, it looks like i dont have connection to internet at the moment
00:53:32 <strcat[m]> JS: they poorly copy our work, falsely claim credit for it and sell a product based on that
00:53:36 <strcat[m]> JS: and at the same time they'
00:54:23 <strcat[m]>  * JS: and at the same time they're spending substantial resources spreading misinformation about GrapheneOS and the GrapheneOS developers, raiding our channels, editing Wikipedia in a biased way to push their narrative, pushing forward with this baseless lawsuit against us (we have our own counterclaims and lawsuit being filed against them), etc.
00:54:51 <JS[m]> Okay, so you guys have been preparing to fight this.
00:54:54 <strcat[m]> they've also registered domains with our brand name maliciously to mislead / trick users among other things
00:55:02 <strcat[m]> JS: recommend reading that thread
00:55:08 <JS[m]> Got it.
00:55:51 <strcat[m]> it's an ongoing thing over the past few years and substantial resources are being dedicated to it (there's more than just the bogus lawsuit based on their false narrative / lies)
00:56:05 <JS[m]> I wish you all the best.
00:56:23 <JS[m]> Hope you can fight it off.
00:58:09 <strcat[m]> we're doing more than just playing defence
00:58:40 <strcat[m]> it's a major focus for us too
00:58:51 <strcat[m]> donations to support the legal effort and the rest of the project are appreciated
00:59:07 <strcat[m]> we just added support for Monero donations today so there are 4 ways to donate now (Bitcoin, Monero, PayPal, GitHub Sponsors)
00:59:08 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1341523656363655169
00:59:13 <JS[m]> I'd give if I had the money.
00:59:26 <JS[m]> I'm waiting on a check right now.
01:00:43 <qubits> strcat what could be the reason that notifications dont work when device is locked, they keep workin only for 30 seconds and after that stops. this applications support work push and dont neeg google play services.
01:01:02 <ynhof[m]> What inspired the name graphene? I like a lotof different materials... Yttrium,erbium, silicon... To name a few
01:02:11 <strcat[m]> qubits: read what I wrote above
01:02:21 <strcat[m]> qubits: you need to ask the app developers and go to the support platforms for the app
01:02:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> JS: actually strcat owns 50% of said company
01:02:40 <qubits> i did readed this is what i found
01:02:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> His own company is being used against him by a person with malicious intent
01:02:51 <qubits> If you experience problems with push notifications, i.e., if incoming messages show up late or only when opening the app (and/or if you are unable to re-establish a connection to Threema Web), the reason usually lies in restrictions imposed by the device maker.
01:02:52 <strcat[m]> qubits: people here are not experts on every app including how their support for running without Play services works
01:03:09 <strcat[m]> qubits: contact the app developers
01:03:18 <JS[m]> Oh, that adds another layer to this.
01:03:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> They also threaten developers and contributors to the grapheneos project and turn them away
01:03:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> They are causing a lot of damage to us
01:03:40 <qubits> In such cases, the Threema app doesn’t have permission to be active in the background and/or to transmit data in the background. Please grant the required permissions as follows:
01:03:53 <qubits> i need to check of it transmit data in background
01:04:07 <strcat[m]> did you follow their instructions?
01:04:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway JS we need help against that
01:04:28 <strcat[m]> please follow what they say (they probably suggest granting a battery optimization exception, the app should request it if it needs it though)
01:04:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> They spread a lot of misinformation and we need all the help we can get to counter it
01:04:33 <strcat[m]> and get support from the app developers
01:04:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> PM me if you want to help
01:04:56 <strcat[m]> ask for help from them rather than here unless it's a GrapheneOS specific issue (this definitely isn't)
01:06:14 <qubits> okay
01:06:18 <qubits> thanks
01:08:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hi valldrac
01:09:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Could you join matrix and pm me?
01:09:37 <strcat> he can PM you from IRC
01:09:46 <strcat> it just can't be E2E encrypted
01:10:04 <valldrac> hi anupritaisno1[m]
01:10:07 <strcat> and UI from Matrix for that isn't great
01:10:14 <strcat> since it doesn't let you know when they're offline
01:10:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> valldrac: yeah pm me I'll reply in a bit
01:10:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Going to sleep rn
01:12:13 <Koba[m]> work profile working on graphene os?
01:14:05 <JS[m]> I should start using IRC.
01:14:45 <rny> nobody likes to use matrix
01:15:18 <ynhof[m]> Aw  now i feel bad for it
01:15:23 <strcat> Koba[m]: yes, device managers including work profile support fully works
01:28:21 <qubits> How to set up work profile on grapheneos?
01:29:10 <strcat> qubits: same as anywhere else - a device manager creates it and manages it
01:29:15 <strcat> we don't provide our own device manager
01:29:38 <qubits> okay wich one can you recommend
01:30:34 <strcat> don't have a recommendation
01:30:39 <strcat> we could develop our own eventually
01:30:57 <strcat> but we'd probably want to do an E2E encryption design for it
01:31:00 <strcat> not a typical one
01:32:28 <qubits> that would be great
01:32:52 <qubits> end to end encryptio design souds great
01:33:19 <JS[m]> IRC is the only good form of Chat Client that's out there currently, right?
01:33:36 <qubits> Is that going to happen or are you just considering it?
01:36:19 <hazel[m]> rny: i like to use matrix ._.
02:07:00 <strcat[m]> JS: hmm?
02:07:16 <strcat[m]> for public channels, IRC is good, it's not a good way to do private messaging
02:09:30 <Dylanger[m]> <qubits "In such cases, the Threema app d"> 👋 fellow Threema user, you need microG for notifications to work, Threema's polling setup is trash
02:10:11 <FukY> Help me not DDoS your server: is setting OFFICIAL_BUILD=false sufficient to avoid the Updater App problem for development builds?
02:10:31 <Dylanger[m]> They've just opened it tho, so someone will likely open a PR that makes it better
02:13:59 <qubits> microG where can i find that
02:16:18 <qubits> Or how can i set up that?
02:19:25 <Dylanger[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/50
02:20:04 <Dylanger[m]> Just working out a way to distribute the microG APK iirc
02:20:21 <hazel[m]> I have Discord (ugh) notifications working with microG without signature spoofing (somehow?)
02:21:26 <hazel[m]> not sure about other apps, or whether this is a hyper-specific thing
02:21:37 <Dylanger[m]> Discord likely have a decent polling system setup
02:21:49 <Dylanger[m]> Threema's is turboshit
02:22:18 <Dylanger[m]> > Be sure to have the app open every 5 minutes!
02:22:18 <Dylanger[m]> 🙃
02:22:19 <hazel[m]> I am so sick of being tied to proprietary platforms by social obligations tbh. at least some of my friends are on Signal, I guess...
02:22:47 <hazel[m]> RIP
02:26:27 <qubits> Dylonger thanks, but i have no idea how to handle this
02:28:34 <Dylanger[m]> TL;DR hopefully the PR will be merged soon and you don't have to do anything
03:56:31 <AgentSmith932963> Hi
03:56:40 <AgentSmith932963> Im trying to isntall Graphene OS on Pixel 4A
03:56:49 <AgentSmith932963> can somebody briefly assist me with a few command clarifications
03:57:00 <AgentSmith932963> Im updating the firmware, and then unlocking OEM
03:57:13 <AgentSmith932963> Where do I obtain the latest fastboot?
03:57:32 <AgentSmith932963> My Platform tools folder doesnt contain the  fastbootfolder
03:58:58 <grapheneos_user_> IDK but you could google "fastboot latest version"
04:00:27 <AgentSmith932963> Just wanted to say
04:00:36 <AgentSmith932963> Thanks, I dontaed $9 to Graphene Project
04:01:25 <AgentSmith932963> is updating the phones firmware really necessary
04:01:28 <AgentSmith932963> Before flashing Graphene
04:01:39 <AgentSmith932963> Because The Google Pixel security patches,,, are for the stock android
04:02:01 <Dylanger[m]> <AgentSmith932963 "is updating the phones firmware "> 💯
04:02:16 <AgentSmith932963> Once I flash graphene, can I still get firmware security updates?
04:02:23 <somenerd[m]> > Because The Google Pixel security patches,,, are for the stock android
04:02:23 <somenerd[m]> they're also for AOSP
04:02:26 <AgentSmith932963> If yes, I can update security firmware after Gos is updated
04:02:43 <somenerd[m]> which means GrapheneOS gets them (Graphene is based off of AOSP)
04:02:44 <AgentSmith932963> Must I update Before Gos install
04:02:51 <AgentSmith932963> Alright
04:02:55 <somenerd[m]> it's preferred
04:02:59 <AgentSmith932963> Alright
04:03:02 <AgentSmith932963> Its just going so slow
04:03:51 <Hawk1291[m]> Hi I'm trying to install Graphene on Pixel 4a using Manjaro Linux and once i run flash-all.sh i get:
04:03:51 <Hawk1291[m]> Setting current slot to 'b'                        FAILED (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')
04:03:51 <Hawk1291[m]> full output: https://pastebin.com/w4jPe1H8
04:04:15 <Hawk1291[m]> how can i get past this?
04:04:29 <AgentSmith932963> Is your Google Pixel unlocked ?
04:04:44 <AgentSmith932963> OEM bootloader unlocked, and Carrier unlocked?
04:04:48 <Hawk1291[m]> yes bootloader and carrier unlocked 100%
04:04:53 <AgentSmith932963> And Firmware fully updated?
04:05:29 <AgentSmith932963> Is the installation stuck
04:05:32 <AgentSmith932963> Or did it clear
04:05:35 <AgentSmith932963> Can you restart your phone
04:05:37 <Hawk1291[m]> im staring at the bootloader and it says unlocked in red and i purchased new from google as unlocked. did all the updates in the stock OS.
04:05:50 <Hawk1291[m]> if i reboot the phone it boots to stock os
04:05:55 <AgentSmith932963> Ok good
04:06:07 <AgentSmith932963> So Fastboot is unlocked?
04:06:11 <AgentSmith932963> Successfully via temrinal?
04:06:19 <Hawk1291[m]> yes
04:06:21 <AgentSmith932963> Ok
04:06:25 <AgentSmith932963> On moment
04:06:35 <AgentSmith932963> Is your Manjero fastboot version at latest verion 30+
04:06:53 <AgentSmith932963> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
04:06:54 <AgentSmith932963> +

04:07:12 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: looks like it probably got interrupted while going and is messed up now, probably need to cancel what it was currently doing
04:07:20 <strcat[m]> make sure you're using a high quality USB port / cable
04:07:32 <AgentSmith932963> I agree, try making sure your using a high quality USb cable and port, affirmative
04:07:55 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: sideload a stock OTA update to recovery to fix the current situation and then follow the flashing procedure for GrapheneOS again
04:08:21 <Hawk1291[m]> belkin type-c to type-c plugged directly into rear type c on motherboard. let me try another cable real quick
04:09:05 <AgentSmith932963> Try plugging USB A to USB C into a standard usb port
04:09:16 <AgentSmith932963> I used a standard usb port
04:09:18 <AgentSmith932963> on my laptop
04:12:52 <Hawk1291[m]> Ok tried the cable that came with the phone on stopped at the same point/same error, and another good quality A>typeC and same thing as well.
04:13:12 <AgentSmith932963> Can you screenshot your screen
04:13:17 <AgentSmith932963> or the terminal window
04:15:58 * Hawk1291[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201222_221402.png (136KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/qmNQvVbxIqZCCTcWNUomyMmt/Screenshot_20201222_221402.png >
04:16:47 <AgentSmith932963> What 'snapshot' is the tool talking about
04:16:52 <AgentSmith932963> Are you using a custom rom alreadY?
04:16:55 <AgentSmith932963> Or stock os
04:17:00 <Hawk1291[m]> stock os
04:17:01 <AgentSmith932963> Perhaps try reformatting the OS,
04:17:10 <AgentSmith932963> Then unlock OEM, update firmware
04:17:18 <AgentSmith932963> reformat the google pixel 4a os
04:17:21 <AgentSmith932963> Thats what I'd try
04:17:33 <AgentSmith932963> Or is fresh out of the box
04:18:21 <AgentSmith932963> ?
04:18:34 <Hawk1291[m]> its fresh out of box but i can tryit anyways. i did only the bare minimum to set it up but maybe i changed something else
04:18:46 <AgentSmith932963> Did you install custom apps
04:18:50 <AgentSmith932963> Edit developer settings etc?
04:18:58 <AgentSmith932963> I just opened my Google Pixel 4A phone too
04:19:12 <AgentSmith932963> I added cellular data service, updated firmware, and OEM unlocked
04:19:14 <Hawk1291[m]> nopejust enabled dev options and oem unlocking option
04:19:16 <AgentSmith932963> Still updating though
04:19:20 <AgentSmith932963> And updated right?
04:19:31 <Hawk1291[m]> and then updates and stuff yes
04:19:35 <AgentSmith932963> Hmm
04:19:41 <AgentSmith932963> I think its your MANJERO installation
04:19:49 <AgentSmith932963> Can you try running a virtual machiene
04:19:59 <AgentSmith932963> and running ana officiall supported os
04:20:01 <AgentSmith932963> actually
04:20:07 <AgentSmith932963> A virtual machiene might notwrok
04:21:08 <Hawk1291[m]> yeah thats what im thinking too at this point. I may have an issue with the fastboot tools. its a good version# but maybe manjaro changes them. I can try the regular install instead.
04:22:15 <Hawk1291[m]> im a little unclear on how adding the tools to the shell path works though...
04:23:51 <AgentSmith932963> try updating the thats
04:25:01 <Hawk1291[m]> thats?
04:25:31 <AgentSmith932963> The fastboot tools
04:25:34 <AgentSmith932963> is the tricky part
04:25:43 <AgentSmith932963> You know how your fastboot is version 30+?
04:25:52 <AgentSmith932963> You have to do that prep just before you install
04:26:15 <AgentSmith932963> Ill help you with this man
04:26:18 <AgentSmith932963> Im installing too
04:26:35 <Hawk1291[m]> much appreciated!
04:27:34 <AgentSmith932963> Ok how did you get fastboot?
04:27:36 <AgentSmith932963> From the google url
04:27:38 <AgentSmith932963> ?
04:28:06 <Hawk1291[m]> yes. the same one in the install docs on the Graphene web page
04:28:39 <Hawk1291[m]> https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.5-linux.zip
04:28:41 <Hawk1291[m]> that one
04:28:49 <AgentSmith932963> yeah
04:29:03 <Hawk1291[m]> but thats not what i was using when i got the error
04:29:08 <Hawk1291[m]> just fyi
04:39:31 <dazinism> Hawk1291: think its the 4a that other people sometimes have had the same problem
04:40:05 <dazinism> If I remember right the solution is to sideload the latest update.
04:42:43 <dazinism> Hawk1291: yeah thats the problem. Hang on I'll get a link
04:43:17 <AgentSmith932963> is the latest update installed just like Graphene is using fastboot?
04:44:51 <Hawk1291[m]> not sure i understand your question but the stock os on the 4a is up to date (i just checked again) and my manjaro install is up to date as well.
04:45:29 <Hawk1291[m]> <dazinism "Hawk1291: yeah thats the problem"> Any help is appreciated! Thank you!
04:46:16 <dazinism> Hawk1291: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201029#c5641487
04:46:47 <dazinism> Someone with the same problem and one of the developers explaining how to fix
04:47:58 <dazinism> Little bit more complex to fix than I'd remembered
04:53:10 <Hawk1291[m]> ok going to try the steps from that link. Thanks a bunch dazinism ! Will let yall know what happens.
04:57:38 <AgentSmith932963> my Mom has Covid19
04:57:46 <AgentSmith932963> and she just intentionally breathed heavily into my face
04:57:50 <AgentSmith932963> What the hell
04:57:54 <AgentSmith932963> She has become the virus
04:58:04 <AgentSmith932963> With the only goal to spread infection
04:58:22 <AgentSmith932963> I have a covid19 antiviral cure
04:58:29 <AgentSmith932963> But It blows my mind how stupid people are

04:59:00 <louipc> please take this discussion elsewhere
05:03:24 <AgentSmith932963> Hawk whats your progress
05:04:11 <Hawk1291[m]> trying to get the boot img sideloaded
05:07:16 <AgentSmith932963> Signify: Unknown parameter '-Cqp'
05:08:01 <Hawk1291[m]> whats that?
05:08:44 <AgentSmith932963> Trying to run Signify
05:08:53 <AgentSmith932963> -Cqp unknown command
05:09:11 <AgentSmith932963> Hey guys
05:09:20 <AgentSmith932963> How do I install the Latest version of Fastboot to my linux OS
05:09:26 <AgentSmith932963> The jolly roger are you here?
05:12:41 <FukY> Did you resolve the SIgnify issue?  If not, are you on a debian distro (e.g. Ubuntu)?
05:13:01 <AgentSmith932963> Debian
05:13:07 <AgentSmith932963> I cant get fastboot working
05:13:22 <AgentSmith932963> My Operating system version of fastboot can unlock and lock fastboot
05:13:30 <FukY> Did you get the google install and add it to your system path?
05:13:33 <AgentSmith932963> but isnt up to date enough to install Graphene OS
05:13:39 <AgentSmith932963> How do i add to system path
05:13:48 <AgentSmith932963> "export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH""?
05:13:50 <AgentSmith932963> That wasnt enough
05:13:55 <AgentSmith932963> I can verify my version, but
05:14:02 <AgentSmith932963> My version is 30+
05:14:15 <AgentSmith932963> But my system doesnt detect fastboot when I try to flash
05:14:36 <strcat[m]> AgentSmith932963: read the information in the install guide about signify on Debian
05:14:40 <strcat[m]> look back at the signify section
05:14:41 <AgentSmith932963> sudo ./flash-all.shsudo: unable to resolve host nicolefastboot not found; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and add it to the shell PATH
05:14:43 <AgentSmith932963> I did
05:15:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> AgentSmith932963: it is very clear you aren't reading
05:15:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> The install guide never told you to use sudo
05:17:25 <AgentSmith932963> Right, now its working
05:20:31 <FukY> "nicolefastboot" in the error seems odd, did you run the export command in a directory other than the one where platform-tools was installed?
05:21:46 <FukY> That path should point directly to where fastboot is installed; like mine points here for example: /home/fuk/DroidGraphene/platform-tools
05:21:47 <AgentSmith932963> Its worked
05:21:56 <AgentSmith932963> It worked for me anyway =)
05:22:49 <AgentSmith932963> I now officially have Graphene OS installed
05:23:00 <strcat[m]> make sure to lock
05:24:22 <AgentSmith932963> Bootloader locked
05:27:08 <AgentSmith932963> Amazing
05:27:13 <AgentSmith932963> I had to activate my phone on my wifi
05:27:29 <Hawk1291[m]> well i wasnt able to get anything accomplished
05:27:31 <AgentSmith932963> So my phone is now linked directly to my home wifi/identity
05:27:52 <AgentSmith932963> I should of activated at public wifi, then came home
05:28:26 <Hawk1291[m]> I tried following these instructions: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201029#c5641487 and kept getting signature errors when i did the adb sideload
05:29:31 <AgentSmith932963> If you can
05:29:35 <AgentSmith932963> You can use a free/avaible USB
05:29:41 <AgentSmith932963> To install a Trisquel Live USB
05:29:51 <AgentSmith932963> and try to use the Live .iso Image, to install all tools
05:30:01 <AgentSmith932963> Im using Trisquel OS, and flashed Graphene Successfully
05:30:42 <Hawk1291[m]> well now system is completely gone. just have fastboot mode and no os.... soft bricked i guess
05:30:47 <Hawk1291[m]> sigh....
05:30:50 <AgentSmith932963> Mang
05:30:51 <Hawk1291[m]> not good
05:30:53 <AgentSmith932963> We can fix this
05:30:56 <AgentSmith932963> Do you have another computer?
05:31:07 <AgentSmith932963> OEM unlocked, disabled
05:31:08 <AgentSmith932963> Perfect
05:31:15 <AgentSmith932963> First, we need to flash default OS
05:31:19 <AgentSmith932963> stock Android AOSP
05:32:27 <Hawk1291[m]> umm ok sure i would feel much better if i could atleast get that back
05:32:39 <AgentSmith932963> Yeah
05:32:42 <AgentSmith932963> Ok so first
05:32:44 <Hawk1291[m]> i have another computer yes but it has same os haha
05:32:49 <AgentSmith932963> MAnjero?
05:33:02 <Hawk1291[m]> yes
05:33:13 <AgentSmith932963> I can guarantee I can help you install GOS if you install Trisquel onto it
05:33:19 <AgentSmith932963> Im using Trisquel, Il help you install Gos
05:33:28 <AgentSmith932963> But first, we need to flash stock Android
05:33:53 <Hawk1291[m]> hmm let me throw another drive into my main pc and i will chat on the laptop brb
05:34:09 <AgentSmith932963> Alright
05:34:21 <AgentSmith932963> If you install Trisquel 8, I can guarantee I'll help you
05:34:26 <AgentSmith932963> Get it working, thats the OS/verison im using
05:34:27 <Hawk1291[m]> will do
05:34:34 <AgentSmith932963> But, you need to fix the ROm on your pixel
05:34:43 <AgentSmith932963> Lets fix the pixel before you go installing Trisquel
05:35:30 <Hawk1291[m]> ok lets do that then
05:35:45 <AgentSmith932963> https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
05:36:18 <AgentSmith932963> Does anybody have link to Google Pixel 4A Stock Factory Images
05:36:51 <AgentSmith932963> I think I found it
05:37:12 <AgentSmith932963> https://developers.google.com/android/ota
05:37:22 <FukY> It's earlier on the graphene page:
05:37:22 <FukY> https://grapheneos.org/releases#sunfish-stable
05:37:31 <AgentSmith932963> Thats the Graphene OS
05:37:36 <AgentSmith932963> He softbricked his phone
05:37:42 <AgentSmith932963> We need to install Stock Android
05:38:06 <AgentSmith932963> https://developers.google.com/android/ota
05:38:11 <AgentSmith932963> Scroll down to 4a section
05:38:52 <AgentSmith932963> Hawk
05:39:00 <AgentSmith932963> Id wait for an official developer/mod to advice you here
05:39:09 <AgentSmith932963> Ive never flashed stock OS after getting softbricked
05:39:41 <FukY> Just to confirm: you're using a 4a and not a 4a 5G?
05:39:50 <FukY> i.e. sunfish and not bramble?
05:39:54 <Hawk1291[m]> yes just regular 4a
05:39:59 <AgentSmith932963> Hawk, Google Pixel 4A =)
05:40:05 <AgentSmith932963> Any mods online?
05:40:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> AgentSmith932963: we do not support trisquel
05:40:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not suggest unofficial methods
05:41:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use an archiso live cd if you don't have a supported distro
05:41:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or even a debian cd
05:42:01 <AgentSmith932963> Triquels works for me to install Graphene, just saying
05:42:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> But not trisquel
05:42:06 <AgentSmith932963> Trisquel 8
05:42:18 <AgentSmith932963> Just trying to add a data point that Trisquel 8 works fully
05:42:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> AgentSmith932963: we don't support it
05:42:23 <AgentSmith932963> alright =)
05:48:12 <FukY> Hawk129: FWIW I've soft-locked myself a few times poking at things and could always restart from the GrapheneOS factory install
05:48:26 <FukY> Obviously there're no guarantees about what your OS is able to support like described earlier
05:48:37 <FukY> but you might be able to recover starting from the factory step:
05:48:38 <FukY> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-factory-images
05:49:28 <AgentSmith932963> you mean, just proceeding to flash Graphene Anyway?
05:49:34 <Hawk1291[m]> cool cool. well im going to try to get the stock img back on for now.
05:49:58 <Hawk1291[m]> waiting for it to download then going to sideload it
05:50:02 <AgentSmith932963> Why is the stock image needed as a base to then install graphene?
05:50:15 <AgentSmith932963> If we just overwrite it with Graphene. The OEM setting?S
05:50:47 <Hawk1291[m]> well graphene wasnt installing so figure i might as well get something on it.
05:51:53 <FukY> They cover the rationale in the prerequ's:
05:51:55 <FukY> "It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure  it's running the latest firmware before proceeding with these  instructions. This avoids running into bugs, missing features or other  differences in older firmware versions. You can either update the device  via over-the-air updates or sideload a full update, which for Pixel  phones can be obtained from the full update package page."
05:52:41 <Hawk1291[m]> i did all that though and still didnt work
05:54:11 <Hawk1291[m]> flashing stock img... 🤞
05:54:42 <Hawk1291[m]> i will just be happy if i can get it back to being a phone right now. so i didnt just blow $300 some odd dollars
05:55:07 <Hawk1291[m]> signature verification failed...
05:56:39 <FukY> That should still be on a screen that can be flashed.  Are you running the flash-all.sh command?
05:56:53 <FukY> i.e. the one in your "sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03" folder?
05:57:00 <Hawk1291[m]> yes it fails
05:57:45 * Hawk1291[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/TniKqjlIQZMxlqvxPHquDpJJ/message.txt >
05:58:08 <Hawk1291[m]> do quotes work over irc bridge?
05:58:21 <FukY> IDK but I see the link at least
05:58:28 <FukY> thanks, was just asking for it
05:59:32 <AgentSmith932963> I think its time to try an officially supported OS, such as Debian
06:02:37 <FukY> It wouldn't hurt, best to be in the tested/supported environment
06:02:41 <FukY> THat slot switch seems weird though
06:02:58 <FukY> I don't recall seeing something like that
06:03:23 <FukY> There's some fastboot command to show the current environment settings I'm trying to find.
06:04:02 <Hawk1291[m]> someone earlier gave me this link where someone had the same issue but the steps did not wokr for me because i get signature verification issue when i sideload. https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201029#c5641487
06:05:58 <FukY> Seems it's only set_slot and not get_slot, I'd have to get it form the full env dump
06:06:05 <FukY> anyways, what do you get when running "fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability" ?
06:07:11 <Hawk1291[m]> (bootloader) get_unlock_ability: 1
06:07:11 <Hawk1291[m]> OKAY [  0.090s]
06:07:11 <Hawk1291[m]> Finished. Total time: 0.090s
06:07:17 <strcat[m]> Hawk1291: I said to sideload the stock OS
06:07:19 <strcat[m]> not GrapheneOS
06:07:27 <strcat[m]> you need to sideload an update to the OS that's already installed
06:07:33 <strcat[m]> please do that before continuing trying to flash
06:09:44 <Hawk1291[m]> yeah anything i try to side load i get verification error. i was sidelkoading the stock ROM as you said
06:11:03 <AgentSmith932963> Time for Debian OS installation
06:11:09 <AgentSmith932963> imo
06:12:12 <dazinism> Don't think the problem is the OS of the PC.
06:12:28 <AgentSmith932963> Really? Thats pretty important
06:12:53 <AgentSmith932963> Everything else is to code
06:13:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hawk1291: snapshot issue can be resolved
06:13:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pm me
06:13:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> You messed up a bit btw
06:13:28 <dazinism> Yeah, kind of, but Manjero is just slightly older arch
06:13:35 <AgentSmith932963> you should just say the fix here so its logged
06:13:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> AgentSmith932963: I won't
06:14:01 <dazinism> So often it should work OK, I've used it before to flash without issues
06:14:16 <AgentSmith932963> ...why?
06:14:24 <AgentSmith932963> Are you against helping the Graphene Communit?
06:14:26 <AgentSmith932963> Community
06:14:40 <dazinism> Hawk1291: yeah go into anupritaisno1 private fixing booth
06:19:06 <ayaen_t[m]> AgentSmith932963:  i am sure anupritaisno1  has own reason or something obvious that does not strike us both
06:19:36 <ayaen_t[m]> for asking Hawk1291 to pm
06:22:59 <AgentSmith932963> does graphene os sandbox the cellular baseband
06:23:18 <AgentSmith932963> or is baseband sandboxing a google pixel 4a base featue on all pixels
06:25:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> ayaen_t: I don't want other users to improvise
06:25:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically
06:25:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why would me or strcat want to support something that wasn't installed correctly?
06:25:53 <ayaen_t[m]> anupritaisno1: makes sense.
06:27:40 <strcat[m]> AgentSmith932963: read the FAQ section
06:28:13 <thedefiant8[m]> Hello, since latest graphene release in having issues with orbot.  When I switch from one profile to the other orbot does not work on that profile unless I specifically turn it off before I switch to the other profile. Is this a known issue?
06:28:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> thedefiant8: ask the orbot devs
06:29:23 <AgentSmith932963> i think orbot is outdated
06:29:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> The app is quite outdated and has only had experimental beta releases for quite a long time
06:29:30 <AgentSmith932963> tor browser is on android now
06:30:08 <AgentSmith932963> fdroid torbrowser =)
06:30:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm actually surprised orbot works with hardened malloc
06:30:22 <thedefiant8[m]> Yeah I thought maybe its a change on graphene its side because it happend after the new release. But tor browser does not make all my traffic go through tor though
06:30:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's so many bugs I was expecting some serious memory corruption
06:30:46 <thedefiant8[m]> Orbot is actually recommend vpn on grapeheneos site
06:30:55 <thedefiant8[m]> Recommended*
06:31:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> thedefiant8: we don't really "recommend" anything
06:31:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> The only 2 things we do recommend are
06:31:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use vanadium and pdfviewer
06:32:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because they improve your security
06:32:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Other things like fdroid, aurora store, orbot, pia are just suggestions
06:32:59 <thedefiant8[m]> implementations and the following open source apps are recommended: Orbot (Tor), 
06:33:31 <thedefiant8[m]> Its saying recommend but anyhow I will try it somewhere within tor devs thanks
06:34:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> * The few things we do recommend are
06:36:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Use vanadium and pdfviewer (basically try to use apps already bundled in the OS if they suit the purpose instead of third party ones)
06:43:05 <AgentSmith932963> i reccomend protonvpn
06:50:00 <dazinism> anupritaisno1: you looked at inviZible pro?
06:52:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> dazinism: tbh I don't use a vpn much
06:52:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> I do pay for a channel bonding service though which is technically a vpn
06:55:52 <dazinism> Looks like a possible alternative to orbot. Its SDK30 which makes it look somewhat promising. Some of its permissions are slightly worrying (install apps, modify settings ) but guess don't have to grant them.
06:55:56 <Hawk1291[m]> Maaan! anupritaisno1 got me fixed up! nice install of Graphene running on my 4a now! yeah!
06:56:48 <dazinism> Nothing quite like our Indian support desk
06:57:06 <AgentSmith932963> nice
06:57:21 <AgentSmith932963> if your trying for anti-stingray/imsi catcher, set lte only mode
06:58:19 <dazinism> Get 4g stingray
06:58:39 <dazinism> All the info to make your own is freely available on the net
06:59:17 <dazinism> The hardware to do it gets ever cheaper
07:00:08 <strcat[m]> the purpose of LTE only mode is attack surface reduction
07:00:23 <dazinism> I don't keep up, but think its likely less than $2000
07:00:37 <dazinism> Maybe a fair bit less
07:00:55 <AgentSmith932963> I think the LTE imsi catcher is only a passive sniffer
07:01:02 <AgentSmith932963> Or is the LTE Imsi catcher a full MITM
07:01:15 <AgentSmith932963> I know the 2G imsi catchers are full MITMs
07:01:25 <AgentSmith932963> and can implant over the air malware as fake system updates on phones
07:01:37 <AgentSmith932963> Which is why Im glad Graphene OS doesnt have OTA updates
07:01:50 <AgentSmith932963> but uses HTTPS/TLS update server
07:01:59 <AgentSmith932963> How are updates authenticated?
07:02:03 <dazinism> Not if your updates are signed (which they are)
07:03:14 <dazinism> If you've got verified boot working on your phone updates have to be signed with that key to work
07:04:00 <dazinism> App updates are also signed
07:04:48 <AgentSmith932963> nice
07:06:06 <dazinism> Generally the network is considered insecure, only poorly written apps or sites don't secure everything
07:06:36 <dazinism> So MITM is a bit less of a concern.
07:07:37 <AgentSmith932963> great
07:07:46 <AgentSmith932963> how is the cellular baseband secured
07:08:52 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#baseband-isolation
07:10:08 <AgentSmith932963> thanks
07:26:25 <AgentSmith932963> Hey
07:26:31 <AgentSmith932963> I read NSA can turn on phones while 'off'
07:26:36 <AgentSmith932963> NSA can locate off phones
07:26:52 <AgentSmith932963> Is that involving the Baseband? And if so, does graphene OS patch it
08:07:42 <neocortex83853> hi
08:07:53 <neocortex83853> is anybody here having google pixel 4a fast battery drain?
08:08:02 <neocortex83853> is there a known battery drain issue with pixel 4a?
08:08:10 <neocortex83853> regardless of os?
08:10:23 <Liakde[m]> Probably hardware, especially if secondhand
08:10:34 <Liakde[m]> as in the battery health is not that great
08:11:04 <neocortex83853> Its a new phone
08:11:16 <neocortex83853> So the Pixel 4A battery loses power quickly?
08:11:24 <neocortex83853> Has few total power charge cycles?
08:31:04 <Liakde[m]> Also depends on what app you use
08:31:44 <Thatcher[m]> <neocortex83853 "is anybody here having google pi"> I'm averaging about 12 hours screen time with Graphene on the 4a. I use Vanadium the most, Newpipe drains the battery quickly, Signal and Threema which are both conservative, and Element which uses almost nothing
08:32:25 <Liakde[m]> Have you tried checking battery app usage
08:39:03 <neocortex83853> Im just wondering
08:39:14 <neocortex83853> Does the Pixel 4a have a documented battery life issue, for some phones etc
08:39:18 <neocortex83853> reguardless of ROM or apps
08:39:28 <neocortex83853> Just a hardware battery defect?
08:41:31 <Thatcher[m]> You'd probably be better asking on the Pixel4a subreddit
08:42:03 <neocortex83853> So guys
08:42:06 <neocortex83853> I have a choice to make
08:42:13 <neocortex83853> I activated my phone on my home WIFI, linking my phone to my name
08:42:24 <neocortex83853> Id rather be more private, by having a phone activated on Public Wifi
08:42:46 <neocortex83853> So My question is, Should I return my phone so i can activate service on public wifi, for increased privacy so the phone carrier sees public wifi IP
08:42:56 <neocortex83853> But I already activated $50 service on my current phone
08:42:59 <Thatcher[m]> No
08:43:19 <neocortex83853> The feds/government can already assosciate my phone the moment I call my parents
08:43:33 <neocortex83853> So even If I register a new phone on Public wifi, the gov can see its me when I call my parents
08:43:41 <neocortex83853> Both by the phone numbers of my parents, and my unique voiceprint
08:43:53 <neocortex83853> But my main concern is government surveillience
08:44:07 <neocortex83853> Can you please elaborate Thatcher?
08:44:24 <neocortex83853> Im not 'hiding from the gov' Im just trying to be as private as possible
08:44:43 <neocortex83853> because hey anybody can be in the government
08:45:28 <Thatcher[m]> You should be worried about corporate surveillance. Degoogling with Graphene was a good first step
08:45:37 <neocortex83853> Yeah its just
08:45:44 <neocortex83853> I dont like how my phone is linked straight to my home WIFI
08:45:56 <neocortex83853> So the phone carrier knows my true home address
08:46:19 <Thatcher[m]> Your phone carrier can triangulate your exact location
08:46:32 <neocortex83853> I know
08:46:36 <neocortex83853> But to prove my phones Identity
08:46:54 <neocortex83853> They have to either: Check the registration IP, which was Verizon on home WIFI at my case
08:46:57 <neocortex83853> B. The numbers I call
08:47:21 <neocortex83853> So anybody trying to learn my phones identity can just check my registration IP with the phone carrier, at my home WIFI
08:48:10 <neocortex83853> Its pretty straightforward
08:48:30 <neocortex83853> I registered my phone on Home WIFI, linking my home WIFI IP to my IMSI phone number
08:49:02 <neocortex83853> So anybody who wants to learn my phones true identity can just check my registration IP
08:49:05 <neocortex83853> and ISP info
08:49:17 <neocortex83853> That is concerning to me
08:49:22 <neocortex83853> So Id rather register on Public Wifi
08:49:32 <neocortex83853> So the only way to discover the owner of the phone is via voice print analysis
08:49:37 <neocortex83853> I use prepaid service cards
08:49:53 <neocortex83853> So I can return my phone, and Lost $50 service pin basically.. more privacy ... but lose $50 :/
08:49:56 <ayaen_t[m]> i think this is getting off topic why dont you guys try
08:50:11 <neocortex83853> do you have any opinion on this ayaen?
08:50:12 <ayaen_t[m]> the offtopic channel?
08:50:44 <somenerd[m]> yeah he went there
08:50:48 <somenerd[m]>  * yeah they went there
08:51:07 <ayaen_t[m]> well we all get carried away sometimes...
09:44:28 <renex> Nice to see Monero added as a donation option. Could bitcoin cash also be added?
09:46:34 <strcat[m]> no
09:48:12 <neocortex83853> You can always convert cryptocurrency
09:49:11 <strcat> people can convert before sending it
09:49:31 <strcat> I have no interest in receiving anything but BTC and XMR
10:03:21 <d3spwn63> Q: I have an app thats unable to access the camera even though it has permissions. What can I do to troubleshoot this?
10:04:11 <neocortex83853> What is the exact error message?
10:04:23 <neocortex83853> It could be App-specific
10:05:08 <ayaen_t[m]> spelling out ap name may help. d3spwn63
10:05:23 <strcat> d3spwn63: turn off the phone, wait a bit and try turning it on again as a first step to rule out it being some kind of temporary state issue with the hardware, firmware, etc.
10:05:42 <strcat> d3spwn63: assuming that the camera isn't working anywhere
10:05:55 <strcat> if it's working elsewhere, make sure that app also has Sensors permissions
10:07:26 <neocortex83853> check the camera app
10:09:33 <d3spwn63> It's the Rabobank app, the message is "warning at the moment its not possible to scan a qr code. please try again later". Other apps can access the camera
10:10:35 <Thatcher[m]> Question: does denying an app Network permission, does thatmean the app wont be able to access wifi and baseband? Or just wifi?
10:13:29 <jpds> Thatcher[m]: All network
10:14:53 <Thatcher[m]> That is amazing. I love Graphene!
10:18:07 <lovestory[m]> Anyone familiar with any malware that turns my chrome browser into chromium and then all sorts of problems suvh as remotely installing systrm apps into my phone and. It doesnt stop there it infects routers and all devices  within the same wireless network and also opens up all your ports on the devices which can....
10:18:52 <lovestory[m]>  Having so much trouble trying to wipe it off my devices i cant get a clean flash
10:20:42 <strcat> lovestory[m]: doesn't sound relevant to this channel
10:20:55 <strcat> this channel is about GrapheneOS
10:23:36 <lovestory[m]> Well actually im trying to ask if theres anyone with experience who might know a way to wipe all data on my device so nothing is gonna surprised me later after ive flashed the firmware. So yeah, its relevant for me
10:24:23 <strcat> it doesn't sound like you're using GrapheneOS
10:25:12 <strcat> you're describing something pretty strange and I don't think there is a technical solution to your problems
10:25:19 <strcat> and it doesn't sound relevant to the channel
10:26:01 <lovestory[m]> Why do you talk so much when when you havent said anything relevant
10:26:23 <somenerd[m]> who do you mean?
10:27:04 <lovestory[m]> Nevermind :) thanks for responding
10:28:13 <strcat> Thatcher[m]: the network permission being disable disallows any direct network access (any kind, even local) and also disallows using APIs requiring the INTERNET permission such as DownloadManager, or APIs exposed by other apps guarded by that
10:29:17 <strcat> lovestory[m]: are you talking about an issue with GrapheneOS? it sounds like you're using a stock OS device and you're saying you think it's compromised (but the story is quite weird) along with other devices
10:29:33 <somenerd[m]> I think it's a troll
10:30:19 <strcat> I don't think it's a troll but it doesn't seem like something on-topic or that we can help with
10:30:29 <somenerd[m]> fair
10:30:50 <Asmodaeus> /whois strcat
10:31:07 <Asmodaeus> Lol
10:31:12 <nscnt> ö_ö
10:31:15 <lovestory[m]> Yes, ive put an end to my off topic banter
10:31:22 <strcat> and I don't think using GrapheneOS is going to be able to response non-technical problems
10:33:08 <lovestory[m]> The whole reason i moved to grapheneOS was to get off google apps
10:34:08 <nscnt> strcat: Is there a 'list' of priorities for more high level development that needs to be done for GrapheneOS? Everything but direct work on the operating system
10:34:23 <ghost_matrix[m]> Hello I was hoping to get some advice.
10:34:24 <ghost_matrix[m]> I want to run graphene OS I'm trying to stay within my budget.
10:34:24 <ghost_matrix[m]> Is a pixel 3a good for running the OS or will support be dropped soon?
10:34:42 <strcat> ghost_matrix[m]: https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
10:34:44 <strcat> don't get a 3a
10:35:08 <strcat> get a 4a (regular non-5G 4a if you don't want to wait for potential future support, or work on it yourself)
10:35:11 <lovestory[m]> Im on 3XL
10:35:17 <ghost_matrix[m]> damn because the 4a is quite expensive
10:35:25 <ghost_matrix[m]> Where I live anyway
10:36:00 <strcat> it's 349 USD when not on sale
10:36:04 <strcat> for a new device
10:36:30 <ghost_matrix[m]> Yeah USD :(
10:36:34 <ghost_matrix[m]> lol
10:36:37 <strcat> Pixel 3a was more expensive new
10:37:42 <strcat> nscnt: there are some priorities, like developing an app for providing support for a first party package repository
10:37:48 <flabbergasted[m]> A Pixel 4A is 660 usd here, ridiculous.
10:37:57 <strcat> with automatic updates not getting in the way
10:38:11 <strcat> nscnt: a good first step would be signing channel names
10:38:12 <strcat> for Updater
10:38:28 <strcat> and then that could be partially reused as a base
10:38:33 <strcat> would make sense to overhaul it a bit
10:39:28 <rny> strcat: do you know how apps know to use maintenance windows in doze mode?
10:39:47 <ghost_matrix[m]> <flabbergasted[m] "A Pixel 4A is 660 usd here, ridi"> Damn!!! Yeah its expensive where I live as well I'm just trying to stuck to a budget but I guess I will save some extra $$$.
10:39:51 <strcat> rny: they don't know, the OS just wakes them then / triggers their alarms/jobs, etc.
10:40:04 <ghost_matrix[m]> * Damn!!! Yeah its expensive where I live as well I'm just trying to stick to a budget but I guess I will save some extra $$$.
10:40:08 <strcat> rny: if they aren't properly using the OS APIs they won't work properly in general
10:40:11 <rny> strcat: what if there's too many jobs and the maintenance window runs out?
10:40:21 <strcat> rny: then they screwed up and need to wait
10:40:23 <rny> do these pending jobs then not get an opportunity to run?
10:40:28 <rny> @_@
10:40:37 <strcat> rny: they all get an opportunity to run if there aren't a ridiculous amount
10:40:57 <strcat> rny: it's pretty fair to apps
10:41:21 <strcat> rny: the proper way to do most things like this is JobScheduler and just accept that for a less used app it doesn't get to run as much
10:41:45 <strcat[m]> rny:  https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/power-details
10:41:47 <rny> strcat: is that an API app developers know to use?
10:41:52 <strcat> are the current generation restrictions
10:41:54 <strcat> rny: yes
10:41:57 <strcat> rny: very widely used
10:42:11 <strcat> rny: some developers use a Play services API that wraps it and supports FCM for waking
10:42:19 <strcat> but most use JobScheduler
10:43:01 <strcat> rny: Updater uses JobScheduler in a kinda odd way because it ignores the usual constraints on running in the background, etc.
10:43:15 <rny> for our friends that use the play services version, does it fuck up the app interaction with doze?
10:43:28 * Birdie[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QOQeHHqZwqvodIoERBgvtbFJ/message.txt >
10:43:33 <rny> i.e. since the wrapping api does not exist, they dont implement jobscheduler?
10:43:47 <strcat> rny: the apps like that probably just won't work at all

10:59:52 <nscnt> Will platform packages also be converted to Kotlin at some point or rather is it wanted? E.g. Updater?
11:02:32 <strcat[m]> nscnt: there are more important things to do
11:02:39 <strcat[m]> including more important modernization
11:02:54 <strcat[m]> that's not really wanted until other priorities are done
11:03:06 <strcat[m]> there are many things to do and hardly anyone working on things overall
11:03:19 <strcat[m]> so we're not really interested in focusing on inconsequential things
11:15:14 <nscnt> I didn't mean converting to Kotlin just for the sake of it
11:15:31 <strcat> new apps should be done in Kotlin
11:15:39 <strcat> but it's disruptive to convert
11:16:52 <nscnt> If Updater is wanted as a base for the other app supporting first party package repository it would be an investment, wouldn't it?
11:17:34 <strcat[m]> other overhauls should probably happen first
11:17:49 <strcat[m]> replacement of deprecated APIs is a higher priority
11:18:18 <strcat[m]> there is an order that things should be done and migrating to Kotlin is not a good idea before doing that
11:18:28 <strcat[m]> especially since there won't be native versions of all that there
11:18:34 <strcat[m]> it's just going to overcomplicate things
11:19:01 <strcat[m]> and right now there isn't someone helping with app development
11:20:04 <nscnt> I'm trying to get a feel what to focus on first, to get started eventually
11:21:10 <strcat[m]> replacement of deprecated code and libraries
11:21:25 <strcat[m]> replacement of dead third party libraries
11:21:36 <strcat[m]> migrating to kotlin before that's done is premature
11:23:44 <nscnt> I wouldn't mind doing it from scratch; using the newest APIs from the beginning
11:24:28 <nscnt> But yea, probably not the most efficient in the beginning. For maintaining, though...
11:27:48 <strcat> the existing stuff needs to be updated and kept in sync
11:28:06 <strcat> Updater needs to be kept in sync with the new app for updating apps
11:28:26 <strcat> definitely need help with a lot of things
11:31:35 <nscnt> I know there's a lot. It's just unclear where to put in the energy first
11:31:48 <nscnt> So taking a look at Updater is a good thing now?
11:38:30 <strcat> nscnt: Auditor, Updater and PdfViewer all need deprecated stuff replaced
11:38:40 <strcat> and the barcode library in Auditor needs to be replaced
11:39:15 <strcat> and the sqlite library in AttestationServer needs to be forked or replaced
11:39:33 <strcat> nscnt: need to make them clean of deprecated / dead stuff before moving to kotlin
11:39:59 <strcat> nscnt: Updater is a good place to start if you want to implement the channel metadata signing (so channel name is verified) and then move on to making the app install/update app
11:42:14 <digiscales[m]> SS.

18:23:09 <fakhx[m]> Not a security feature and more like anti theft one , is there a way to disable shutdown from lockscreen or at least ask for password before confirming it like samsung phones do ?
18:23:53 <nscnt> You're better off if the theft turns off your phone
18:25:46 <fakhx[m]> How come ?
18:25:46 <fakhx[m]> You probably mean that the fbe will kick in
18:25:46 <fakhx[m]> But i mean if its still on with some anti theft software we could still track the phone and hopefully get it back
18:35:25 <nscnt> The theft just needs to wait for the battery to die. Maybe put it in a faraday bag or put it under a rock at the next forest (or wherever, just not in your house). If you put it under the rock, he doesn't need to care whether it was tracked or not. He won't be caught as a culprit even if you get it back (which is exactly how motorcycles are getting stolen; parked in a public parking lot and
18:35:27 <nscnt> waiting if it's still there after a week)
18:37:33 <nscnt> Your phone will be stolen anyway and you probably will never see it again
18:39:14 <nscnt> And then it's good if it's turned off and even factory resetted

20:57:57 <strcat[m]> you're just not deleting everything
20:58:05 <strcat[m]> did you select the time period to delete
20:58:30 <strcat[m]>  * did you select the time period to delete?
20:58:39 <strcat[m]> the default is last hour
21:04:00 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "did you select the time period t"> as said i always choose from all time
21:05:30 <strcat[m]> and did you go to advanced and select everything?
21:05:55 <strcat[m]> we don't change anything about this or related to it and it's highly unlikely you found a major Chromium bug like that in a major release
21:06:03 <strcat[m]> you're just doing something wrong, you need to look more carefully at what you're doing
21:06:18 <nscnt> A build is needed to test changes made to Updater, isn't it?
21:07:40 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "you're just doing something wron"> its kind of weird. i choose ddata privacy delete everything all time, i close browser reopen without opening any page, go to delete , graphene and celvecda gcam mods page has still data, could it be its favourites?
21:07:55 <r0tt0r[m]> and where can i manage saved favourites
21:08:16 <strcat[m]> and you don't have the page already open?
21:08:25 <strcat[m]> and it's not saved as a PWA?
21:10:43 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "and you don't have the page alre"> no browser starts cleared and empty
21:10:50 <r0tt0r[m]> <strcat[m] "and it's not saved as a PWA?"> pwa?
21:12:09 <r0tt0r[m]> ok
21:12:23 <strcat> added to homescreen
21:12:24 <r0tt0r[m]> found bookmarks in main 3dots
21:12:33 <r0tt0r[m]> there the pages were added
21:12:35 <strcat> it will fetch favicons for bookmarks
21:12:38 <strcat> that's probably it
21:12:44 <strcat> it's just talking about the favicon
21:12:54 <strcat> turn off your networking and clear data
21:12:59 <strcat> turn off wifi/mobile data
21:13:06 <strcat> and then check after clearing
21:13:12 <strcat> and then turn it on and you'll see it fetches the favicon
21:13:17 <r0tt0r[m]> yep that was it
21:13:30 <r0tt0r[m]> its the favicon
21:13:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tested with vanadium just now
21:13:43 <strcat> r0tt0r[m]: there's a way to browse the data
21:14:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Everything is correctly deleted
21:14:43 <r0tt0r[m]> ye reopening the favicon image is fetched for bookmarks
21:14:47 <strcat[m]> ah nvm they removed chrome://cache due to split cache
21:37:52 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "ah nvm they removed chrome://cac"> I'm sad about that
21:37:55 <Dylanger[m]> ☹️
22:04:12 <greentaco> good afternoon all
22:04:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> greentaco: do you need help with something?
22:04:35 <greentaco> im having trouble installing graphene on piexel 4a. batch install file doesn't work
22:04:39 <greentaco> yes  I do
22:04:51 <greentaco> stuck in fast boot mode
22:05:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> greentaco: ok post the install log
22:05:35 <greentaco> can you show me how
22:06:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> greentaco: you can definitely copy whatever your shell says and paste it somewhere
22:06:40 <greentaco> got it
22:07:51 <greentaco> i lost access to adb , again. can i get it back some how. i copy paste the command line screen
22:08:08 <greentaco> ./flash-all.bat : The term './flash-all.bat' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included,
22:08:09 <greentaco> (./flash-all.bat:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
22:09:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Seems pretty obvious what's wrong
22:12:00 <greentaco> I knew it , what could it be?
22:12:30 <greentaco> fiddling around with file location, but I do have the most recent download from SDK
22:13:59 <greentaco> I also figured it was that slot a, b thing that gave me trouble on my oneplus, I just gave up on that.
22:18:12 <strcat> ypi
22:18:17 <strcat> you're not meant to use adb
22:18:24 <strcat> it sounds like you're not following our official install guide
22:18:51 <strcat> greentaco: follow https://grapheneos.org/install and please don't follow any unofficial guides - they're nearly all inaccurate and propose incorrect workarounds for their mistakes
22:18:56 <strcat> start over using the official install guide
22:20:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> greentaco: we don't do oneplus here
22:20:52 <strcat[m]> adb isn't part of the installation process
22:20:59 <strcat[m]> they said they're installing on a Pixel 4a earlier
22:20:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> The bootloader on oneplus is legitimately terrible and people come up with stupid hacks
22:21:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do not use these hacks on pixel
22:21:34 <greentaco> Ok so here it is, im stuck with a bootloader unlocked and now OS on the device at all.
22:21:47 <strcat[m]> start over following the official install guide
22:21:50 <strcat[m]> don't follow an unofficial one
22:21:55 <greentaco> im trying to recover from this first and then get back to the flash-all script.
22:22:10 <strcat[m]> start with https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
22:22:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> greentaco: there is no need to "recover"
22:22:14 <greentaco> the flash all script is where it all goes south. thinking about using an ubuntu live CD for this
22:22:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just follow the official guide
22:22:19 <greentaco> Windoze sucks
22:22:30 <strcat[m]> greentaco: Windows 10 is the easiest thing to use
22:22:40 <strcat[m]> using Ubuntu is just going to make it harder
22:22:58 <strcat[m]> you need to follow the official guide, not an unofficial one, which seems to be your mistake
22:23:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm not sure if troll or FSF worshipper at this stage
22:23:06 <strcat[m]> start over with the official one, let us know if you have any issues following that
22:23:35 <greentaco> ""The version check in the flashing script will prevent accidentally using these.""
22:23:45 <greentaco> I think the above is the problem , bad fastboot
22:23:54 <strcat[m]> yeah, start over with obtaining fastboot
22:24:05 <strcat[m]> you must have followed unofficial instructions with issues
22:24:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <greentaco """The version check in the flash"> Is it really?
22:25:02 <strcat[m]> please just start over with the official instructions before discussing it here further
22:25:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Read your error. You didn't set up your path variable correctly
22:25:07 <strcat[m]> you may have no issues following it
22:25:31 <greentaco> what about this after the command to flash all bat? just curious
22:25:32 <greentaco> < waiting for any device >
22:25:42 <strcat[m]> just start over
22:25:58 <strcat[m]> your device needs to be plugged in and in the bootloader menu mode
22:26:02 <strcat[m]> per the instructions
22:28:27 <greentaco> let me try this again.
22:28:32 <greentaco> thanks all
22:32:03 <greentaco> OK I got it
22:32:08 <greentaco> just like you guys said.
22:32:27 <strcat> just make sure to lock after flashing
22:32:28 <greentaco> Its not complete but stuck in fastboot mode and shell is waiting for device
22:33:46 <greentaco> but it did do all the steps i believe in the flash-all bat, because i never seen it do this before..
22:36:01 <greentaco> fastboot: error: Failed to boot into userspace fastboot; one or more components might be unbootable.
22:36:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Interesting
22:36:48 <greentaco> Sending 'bootloader_b' (8341 KB)                   OKAY [  0.495s]
22:36:49 <greentaco> table for Lun = 4
22:37:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmmmm
22:37:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Useless filters...
22:37:31 <strcat> they tried to paste a bunch probably
22:37:40 <strcat> it was freenode that kicked them
22:37:50 <strcat> from the whole server
22:40:24 <nscnt> A build is needed to test changes made to Updater, isn't it?
22:40:56 <nscnt> ... whole OS build?
23:01:33 <greentaco> hi I was able to go thru all the steps but now, I am stuck in the fastboot mode with and error. enter reason: no valid slot to boot.
23:01:38 <greentaco> any suggestions
23:06:21 <strcat[m]> greentaco:  you need to finish flashing
23:06:25 <strcat[m]> what kind of USB cable are you using
23:07:39 <greentaco> OnePLus 7T , pretty good oe
23:07:41 <greentaco> one
23:08:56 <greentaco> OnePLus 7T , pretty good one.
23:09:30 <greentaco> I think I am screwed because I locked the bootloader and I cant get to sideload android again on the device.
23:10:27 <greentaco> I cant do this command fastboot erase avb_custom_key
23:14:43 <greentaco> OK so i unlocked the bootloader again. Sorry im such a noob at this.
23:15:10 <nscnt> greentaco: What device do you want to flash again?
23:15:21 <greentaco> in in a reboot cycle where the reason at the bottom is reboot bootloader and I never get to the OS screen
23:15:25 <greentaco> Pixel 4a
23:15:47 <greentaco> and I have flashed a few times now with the flash-all bat
23:18:59 <strcat> you're not supposed to run fastboot erase avb_custom_key
23:19:02 <strcat> why are you running that?
23:19:23 <greentaco> I didn't I got stuck with the bootloader locke and I couldn't do anything about it.
23:19:29 <strcat> greentaco: it's quite possible the OnePlus cable is not to spec
23:19:38 <greentaco> great to hear that
23:19:39 <strcat> greentaco: don't lock the bootloader until you're finished flashing
23:19:44 <greentaco> i wont
23:20:07 <strcat> run fastboot --version and say what the result is
23:20:09 <greentaco> does the original pixel4a a good choice
23:20:13 <greentaco> ok hold on
23:20:36 <greentaco> fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
23:21:32 <greentaco> could I use the original pixel 4a cable I do have a usb -c jack on there.
23:21:43 <strcat[m]> yes use the Pixel cable
23:21:54 <strcat[m]> just switch to that cable before doing more
23:22:00 <strcat[m]> you don't need to redo anything because of switching
23:23:45 <greentaco> here i go , brb
23:41:35 <Golli[m]2> Has anyone got an equaliser to work in GOS?
23:41:35 <Golli[m]2> Currently trying to use Neutralizer but nothing :(
23:45:51 <strcat> Golli[m]2: there's a built-in one of some kind
