05:13:20 <murderous_rabbi4> Hello, I just logged in here to ask some questions unrelated to GrapheneOS but I thought I would get more reasonable answers here. Recently I became somewhat privacy conscious and since I own an Android phone (OnePlus 7T), I thought I could just install LineageOS without Google apps and call it a day. But I just learned that's worse for my phone's security than not doing anything at all.
05:13:20 <murderous_rabbi4> I recently read from Daniel Micay's comments on the LineageOS subreddit from last year that in order to have some basic security, I would at least need an Android OS with verified boot enabled and the latest firmware and security updates installed. LineageOS does not do any of this by itself and is fundamentally insecure. So my question is, can I build a version of AOSP or LineageOS for my phone that does all
05:13:20 <murderous_rabbi4> this? I don't have any experience building Android, but how difficult would it be to undertake this task? It's just for my own use, and let's say it's more of a hobby project than anything serious. Can I build a custom Android that at least comes close to the security of my stock OS, or is more secure than LineageOS? Thank you
05:14:45 <cn3m[m]> murderous_rabbit: you should get a Pixel or iPhone if you can. However, you can get GlassROM for that device maybe
05:15:01 <cn3m[m]> https://riot.im/app/#/room/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org the offtopic room would be the best
05:32:21 <murderous_rabbi4> <cn3m[m] "murderous_rabbit: you should get"> Thank you. I can't afford to get a Pixel or iPhone anytime soon, but I could perhaps consider buying used. I'll check out GlassROM in the meanwhile, looks interesting!

05:36:09 <murderous_rabbi4> https://github.com/GlassROM-devices
05:37:39 <international> i think it's all for one plus
05:37:56 <cn3m[m]> <murderous_rabbi4 "It seems to be LineageOS with ve"> it is lineage with verified boot and uses some GrapheneOS patches for security(most), but the devices don't meet the hardware standards
05:38:13 <cn3m[m]> OnePlus devices will never be supported by GrapheneOS
05:38:40 <cn3m[m]> AOSP isn't supported on OnePlus either which creates a problem
05:38:46 <international> my friends got samsung note 10 and realme x2 pro and asking me for help to make them better devices until they can buy pixel 4
05:39:02 <cn3m[m]> GlassROM is basically taking worse hardware and code base, but trying to do the same tweaks

05:54:00 <international> instead  of one plus
05:55:10 <murderous_rabbi4> Oh I would if I could. It's just that I can't buy a new phone anytime soon. I'm just considering my options until I can get myself a Pixel or an iPhone. I just got this phone less than a year back, so it's kind of difficult justifying a new phone right now
05:56:59 <murderous_rabbi4> Plus I'm short on money right now
05:57:32 <international> which one plus are you using
05:57:50 <murderous_rabbi4> 7T
05:57:54 <international> as company seems drifting on what they started

13:39:57 <blacktwig[m]> Anyone using Ting mobile on GOS? Any problems with it that I should know about? I searched the logbot but there didn't seem to be anything about it.
13:49:15 <nickcalyx[m]> Ting used to be sprint based but I think it's tmobile now?
15:29:33 <clannad[m]> It seems I managed to destroy my sleep schedule so much
15:30:23 <clannad[m]> If you'd look at it it's basically normal now
15:32:02 <snowfur[m]1> <g65434-2[m] "usually I just verify with virus"> I just use "sha256sum <filename>" on Terminal or open Powershell and then run "Get-FileHash <filename>"
15:32:03 <clannad[m]> Can't have that though I'm way more productive at night
15:32:03 <clannad[m]> Gonna unfuck it during this weekend
16:01:31 <Knull[m]> > <@anupritaisno1:m.apex.to> Can't have that though I'm way more productive at night
16:01:32 <Knull[m]> > Gonna unfuck it during this weekend
16:01:32 <Knull[m]> skip an entire day, go to sleep as late as you can (8 or 9pm the next day), works itself out. Full circle. Had to do that like 5 times in my life lol
16:10:40 <blacktwig[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Ting used to be sprint based but"> Yea I think they use Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon networks. I heard Sprint requires some pretty invasive stuff to work, but would that affect MVNO's?
16:14:10 <nickcalyx[m]> Probably
16:14:37 <wreck[m]> i wonder how much of that is going to go away with the tmo-sprint acquisition
16:14:52 <nickcalyx[m]> All
16:15:00 <wreck[m]> 🙌
16:28:10 <clannad[m]> <Knull[m] "> <@anupritaisno1:m.apex.to> Can"> Precisely what I'm doing rn
16:43:51 <rickza[m]> Can anybody help with the email message ( The following devices have failed to provide valid attestations before the expiry time: )
16:44:52 <rickza[m]> attestation history gives me ( Last verified time: Fri Jul 31 2020 17:40:07 )
16:45:59 <rickza[m]> true !
18:08:58 <sting-ray[m]> Any way to play PUBG on GrapheneOS?
18:09:15 <sting-ray[m]> 11 trackers on Aurora
18:19:09 <alex-resist> Are people aware of this? https://omertadigital.com/ It's someone selling brutally overpriced GrapheneOS phones with full on buzzword marketing (e.g. "military grade encryption")
18:30:37 <nickcalyx[m]> It was posted before
18:33:43 <alex-resist> Ok thx
18:35:17 <SchismXL[m]> <alex-resist "Are people aware of this? https:"> https://omertadigital.com/blogs/news/introducing-grapheneos they (I think he's a one person team?) does reference Daniel and GrapheneOS. From my point of view, it's unethical to charge such a premium for these devices, there's not a lot that can be done about it?
18:36:06 <SchismXL[m]> But, if there's a market for it, people will cater for it
18:39:15 <alex-resist> The cryptophone market is weird. Some are still selling super old Samsung Galaxy phones from 2014 with some added crypto for over 1000€
18:39:34 <applescruff_53[m> Yet anther American get rich quick scheme using other people's money and ignorance.
18:39:59 <alex-resist> Omerta is British, but not much of a difference
18:40:43 <cn3m[m]> <sting-ray[m] "Any way to play PUBG on Graphene"> yeah it works
18:43:30 <SchismXL[m]> <alex-resist "The cryptophone market is weird."> Wait until you see the price of librebooted 15+ year old ThinkPads.
18:45:08 <alex-resist> I know about them, but they're not in the thousands
18:46:34 <jneplokh> Or the Librem 5 for $750 lol
18:47:45 <alex-resist> The Librem 5 USA Edition for $1999 is actually in the same league, now that you mention that
18:48:46 <blacktwig[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Probably"> Aight in choosing the sim you can choose what network so I just went with Verizon. Thanks
18:49:28 <nickcalyx[m]> Neat
19:00:40 <kingkong22[m]> Does anyone know if the SnapChat App will install and run on Graphene please?
19:03:30 <SchismXL[m]> <kingkong22[m] "Does anyone know if the SnapChat"> If I remember correctly, no, because it requires Google Safety Net, which GrapheneOS doesn't have.
19:04:12 <kingkong22[m]> <SchismXL[m] "If I remember correctly, no, bec"> Ok thanks
19:46:34 <LinusSexTips[m]> Snapchat does not works
19:51:07 <kingkong22[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "Snapchat does not works"> Ok thanks
19:51:33 <LinusSexTips[m]>  * Snapchat does not work
20:30:31 <faxing[m]> I think it has a heavy reliance on Google Play Services, so it's extremely unlikely
20:34:15 <cdesai> One thing for all matrix users, not trying to single out anyone, but it's something I've noticed in general
20:34:27 <cdesai> when you edit a message, for irc the message is sent again with the edits
20:34:41 <cdesai> so if it's a long multi line message with multiple edits, that can get messy real fast.
20:45:10 <cn3m[m]> Snapchat only works if you use the Huawei version(eh)
20:45:20 <cn3m[m]> <cdesai "One thing for all matrix users, "> that is definitely me. I'm sorry
20:46:10 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: I totally wasn't trying to single out anyone, and honestly I don't think I've noticed it from you
20:46:44 <cn3m[m]> 😀 good advice for sure
20:49:13 <alzxjm[m]> Wait, you can edit comments?
20:49:21 <cn3m[m]> yes
20:49:22 <alzxjm[m]> /s
20:49:22 <cn3m[m]>  * yes you can
20:49:26 <alzxjm[m]> ha
21:56:52 <overheadscallop[> Did you turn on LTE-only mode? VoLTE isn't working
21:57:10 <overheadscallop[> you need to change it to LTE (preferred)

22:03:18 <dazinism> rickza: or have you selected 'clear auditee pairings' in the auditor app?

22:04:07 <nikitalita[m]> not used to matrix quite yet
22:11:41 <rickza[m]> well there are times that i have no connection but not more than 4 hours as the delay is set to
22:12:26 <rickza[m]> i didnt clear auditee pairings since January when i bought the phone and flashed it but then at the beginning of this month i cleared them and re-paired
22:13:21 <rickza[m]> the history on attestation.app site says last verified time was today but emails say it could provide valid attestation before the expiry time
