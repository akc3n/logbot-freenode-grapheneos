03:03:21 <spathionema[m]> i just installed CalyxOS... styles & wallpaper crashes every time I try to change wallpaper... what's wrong? am i doing something wrong? or is it just a shit os?
03:14:36 <strcat[m]> this is the GrapheneOS channel
03:39:07 <mistazaki[m]> how to enable tethering settings in another user?
03:49:42 <alex-a-soto[m]> Hey folks, I'm using a Pixel 3a running QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.10.05 is it safe to run the latest update on this device?
03:51:22 <Wonderfall[m]> You should update, yes.
03:54:36 <alex-a-soto[m]> If I remember correctly, back when this update was released some users who were using a different update channel experienced a problem upon restart related to Android 11 and encryption. Was curious if that's been resolved and safe for such users to update now.
03:59:16 <dazinism> alex-a-soto: pretty sure you can safely update now GrapheneOS is on Android 11. Was a problem moving from that build to later Android 10 builds.
04:01:04 <alex-a-soto[m]> Thank you!
04:29:19 <strcat[m]> yes the issue was you couldn't upgrade from that cancelled Beta release to the Android 10 release without the Android 11 kernel we'd tested in that Beta
04:29:22 <strcat[m]> we had to roll it back
04:29:28 <strcat[m]> but no issue upgrading to Android 11 from it
04:32:26 <alex-a-soto[m]> Thank you strcat, upgraded just now and everything seems to be working great
05:38:04 <fuchs[m]> How can i switch the color theme oft the phone?
06:01:11 <noob8650> Goddamnit guys :(
06:01:23 <noob8650> I am that dude that asked around here for tips a few weeks ago.
06:01:26 <noob8650> Got the new phone
06:01:31 <noob8650> And this is what I see: https://i.postimg.cc/JhvPjDb5/image.png
06:01:36 <noob8650> Should I just return it?
06:02:01 <noob8650> OEM Unlocking is grayed out. To hell with this proprietary locking man
06:02:25 <joltman[m]> Caveat emptor
06:02:35 <somenerd[m]> yeah I think it should be returned...
06:02:39 <somenerd[m]> > Caveat emptor
06:02:40 <somenerd[m]> ?
06:02:43 <noob8650> ffffuuuuuu
06:02:50 <joltman[m]> Buyer beware
06:03:10 <noob8650> Literally where can I get this device where it isn't hit-and-miss?
06:03:13 <joltman[m]> I had to return the first two refurb phones I bought for that very same reason
06:03:27 <noob8650> Is there no way around this?
06:03:46 <noob8650> Like absolutely no way?
06:03:53 <somenerd[m]> maybe through google?
06:04:04 <somenerd[m]> > Like absolutely no way?
06:04:04 <somenerd[m]> I don't think there is a way
06:04:05 <joltman[m]> You can get a new 4/4XL/4a from Google. That's one option.
06:04:41 <somenerd[m]> yeah directly from google
06:04:45 <joltman[m]> For used, I would recommend certain preferred buyers on www.swappa.com.
06:04:47 <noob8650> Man this is actually pissing me off right now
06:05:10 <noob8650> And in addition to that, other people were involved. I got the damn thing new aaaa
06:05:31 <joltman[m]> Yeah, I went through the same thing. Took me over a month to get what I wanted.
06:05:40 <noob8650> (At a good price though) But why the hell do they even lock the bootloader?
06:05:58 <noob8650> joltman[m]: Where did you finally get what you needed?
06:06:38 <joltman[m]> I got mine from www.swappa.com. The seller was "Farewellcell".
06:07:38 <noob8650> joltman[m]: This feels so retarded. It's so unnecessary. I'll literally return a phone I JUST opened. Holy shit. But okay, they deserve it, I'm in the 14 days.
06:08:00 <joltman[m]> "Farewellcell" sells a lot on there and he posts pictures of that screen showing OEM Unlocked.
06:08:30 <noob8650> joltman[m]: I entered Farewellcell into the search bar, no results
06:08:56 <noob8650> https://swappa.com/mobile/buy/google-pixel-3a-xl/unlocked
06:08:58 <noob8650> ?
06:09:57 <joltman[m]> I had previously purchased from another seller with only about 85 reviews (pretty much all positive) and he even had pics of the screen showing that bootloader could be unlocked, but that wasn't the phone I received.
06:11:37 <noob8650> joltman[m]: Man, that's stupid
06:12:04 <noob8650> Well, at least I can now warn everyone, that MediaMarkt doesn't seem to be selling the phones to you, just their usage.
06:12:23 <noob8650> Just out of curiousity, why do they even lock the damn bootloader?
06:12:59 <somenerd[m]> for carriers, maybe to keep people from flashing stock?
06:13:05 <somenerd[m]>  * for carriers, maybe to keep people from flashing stock android?
06:13:11 <joltman[m]> Farewellcell has a couple 3XL up for sale, but no 3aXL
06:14:20 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: But the phone is literally just stock, except that option. There is no carrier, just the bootloader lock. I... really don't get it. This'll e awkward to explain to my parents, whom were so kind as to take an interest and order it.
06:14:28 <joltman[m]> Idk why Verizon does that with their phones
06:14:55 <noob8650> joltman[m]: It's not a verizon phone, I'm in the EU, it's literally stock just with locked bootloader
06:15:04 <noob8650> God I was never this mad at an impersonal settings option
06:15:05 <noob8650> https://swappa.com/mobile/buy/google-pixel-3a-xl/unlocked
06:15:16 <noob8650> Where do I see this seller? Sorry, I'm blind.
06:15:16 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: But the phone is literally just stock, except that option. There is no carrier, just the bootloader lock. I... really don't get it. This'll e awkward to explain to my parents, whom were so kind as to take an interest and order it.
06:15:16 <somenerd[m]> wait huh?
06:15:39 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Yes, there is no carrier lock, just the stupid bootloader lock.
06:15:41 <joltman[m]> Verizon is the only carrier I know for sure that does this, but I'm sure there are others.
06:16:24 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: Yes, there is no carrier lock, just the stupid bootloader lock.
06:16:24 <somenerd[m]> wow
06:16:38 <joltman[m]> You could try connecting to the internet and then calling the carrier and see if they'll unlock it, but I don't think they will.
06:16:40 <noob8650> https://www.mediamarkt.de/de/product/_google-pixel-3a-xl-64-gb-just-black-2546766.html
06:16:49 <noob8650> joltman[m]: Is it worth a try?
06:16:57 <noob8650> Where can I find the contact to call?
06:20:01 <noob8650> Hahahahahhah
06:20:04 <noob8650> Goddamnit
06:20:27 <joltman[m]> I don't know the carriers in Europe. You might start by calling the seller.
06:21:48 <joltman[m]> You really should ask before buying, but maybe ask if their phones can be bootloader unlocked and whether they will do that for their customers.
06:22:18 <noob8650> I was very hesitant about connecting to the internet (fearing updates would take my ability to change anytthing due to an automatic update Ã -la Windows) but I connected it to my wifi and... I was able to activate bootloader unlocking
06:22:40 <joltman[m]> They might lock the bootloaders so that noobs don't brick their phones and then try to flash original ROMs back and end up sending their bricks in under warranty. Who knows?
06:22:52 <noob8650> But why would it be configured so that you can't unlock the bootloader before you have connected to the internet once?
06:24:11 <joltman[m]> Maybe they want a record of your IP or something
06:24:50 <joltman[m]> Anyway, it sounds like you're good to go now.
06:24:50 <noob8650> Some sort of outlandish reasoning like "well at least we want to know where he started out" (before building bombs inshallah)?
06:24:57 <noob8650> Phew...
06:25:05 <noob8650> Is it usually this way?
06:25:28 <noob8650> I mean, I guess a single connect is enough, they have my home address now via wifi-geolocation
06:25:30 <joltman[m]> Maybe in EU it is. Not my experience in the US.
06:25:43 <noob8650> joltman[m]: So in the US you can unlock it offline?
06:27:18 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: It looks like we're back in the green, turns ouy you can't activate the bootloader unlocking option without first connecting to the internet. I connected to my home wifi (bastards got my address now) and was allowed to enable bootloader unlocking.
06:27:29 <joltman[m]> The two locked phones I got couldn't be unlocked whether I was online or not. The one I got was already OEM Unlocked, so I couldn't test whether internet was required to toggle that on. I did a factory reset and it was still OEM unlocked.
06:28:16 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: It looks like we're back in the green, turns ouy you can't activate the bootloader unlocking option without first connecting to the internet. I connected to my home wifi (bastards got my address now) and was allowed to enable bootloader unlocking.
06:28:20 <somenerd[m]> cool ig
06:28:40 <noob8650> "ig"?
06:28:50 <noob8650> *is a boomer
06:28:57 <somenerd[m]> I guess
06:29:04 <noob8650> haha sorry
06:29:08 <joltman[m]> It's possible that it's only the case with new phones, because used phones have all likely connected to the internet at some point.
06:29:14 <somenerd[m]> :D
06:29:36 <noob8650> joltman[m]: That makes sense. Though it still doesn't explain the reason of initially requiring connection
06:29:58 <noob8650> Maybe I just blew my opsec (he said behind a mere cloak) by connecting the the net from home. Now they theoretically have my address
06:30:19 <somenerd[m]> ip address?
06:30:24 <joltman[m]> There's probably a reason. I just don't know what it is. Maybe to track sales channels.
06:30:34 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Yeah, wifi-triangulation is scary-accurate
06:30:53 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: Yeah, wifi-triangulation is scary-accurate
06:30:53 <somenerd[m]> .....
06:31:00 <joltman[m]> It wouldn't always accomplish that purpose because people can use VPN to hide their locations.
06:31:05 <somenerd[m]> > Maybe I just blew my opsec (he said behind a mere cloak) by connecting the the net from home. Now they theoretically have my address
06:31:06 <somenerd[m]> they? I'm confused
06:32:01 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: They the cia-glowies of course :D
06:32:16 <noob8650> I'll quickly write a chant in holy C
06:32:17 <somenerd[m]> hmm
06:32:41 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: It was a joke, don't worry about it, I was just talking trash
06:33:03 <somenerd[m]> ik that lmao
06:33:04 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: It's this developer-gone-insane Terry A. Davis (F)
06:33:09 <noob8650> o-oh
06:33:12 <somenerd[m]>  * hmm lmao
06:33:22 <somenerd[m]> ... ok?
06:33:23 <somenerd[m]> ok
06:33:23 <noob8650> >_<
06:33:56 <somenerd[m]> lol
06:34:06 <somenerd[m]> you're on IRC right?
06:34:09 <somenerd[m]> which client?
06:34:10 <noob8650> Whew, okay, so now I'll have to look up the instructions on how to flash
06:34:19 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Yes? No shenanigans pls.
06:34:28 <somenerd[m]> it's on the website
06:34:29 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Konversation
06:34:36 <noob8650> I used matrix initially.
06:34:38 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: Yes? No shenanigans pls.
06:34:43 <somenerd[m]> what shenanigans lmao
06:35:04 <noob8650> Is "matrix"  actually easier to use securely than IRC?
06:35:20 <somenerd[m]> idk /shrug
06:35:24 <noob8650> Connecting via TOR is already a hassle I did not want to undertake here on freenode
06:35:24 <somenerd[m]>  * idk shrug
06:35:34 <somenerd[m]> but you can use e2ee on matrix
06:35:54 <noob8650> I heard some people route their twitter, facebook, matrix and other stuff all to irc
06:36:10 <noob8650> Is it some sort of hipster commandline fad or is there a reason for it?
06:36:20 <somenerd[m]> idk, convenience probably
06:36:42 <noob8650> But there'd have to be auxilliary options to make it secure.
06:36:49 <noob8650> *measures
06:37:09 <somenerd[m]> mmhm yeah
06:38:00 <noob8650> I am starting to feel this "privacy is a lifestyle rather than a few adjustments" mantra more and more ugh
06:38:20 <noob8650> I bet I don't know half of what I'd need to know to use IRC securely.
06:39:25 <noob8650> But I am so happy that the option was alright
06:39:30 <noob8650> And that it could be unlocked
06:39:50 <somenerd[m]> > I bet I don't know half of what I'd need to know to use IRC securely.
06:39:50 <somenerd[m]> same boat for most of us here :)
06:41:01 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Add to that trying ot use weechat (or irssi if you want less features) with all the cmdline options haha
06:41:24 <somenerd[m]> mmhm
06:41:32 <noob8650> But it does give you some astonished reactions when people see it. Dude I met was impressed when he saw me chatting in tty.
06:42:38 <noob8650> (Because I was too inept/slow/lazy to quickly install a graphical environment and still hat too look up what I need to install - was when I tried to set up a minimal DE on a weak netbook)
06:42:47 <somenerd[m]> lol
06:42:56 <noob8650> s/hat too/had to
06:43:03 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: ^^
06:43:10 <somenerd[m]> ok
06:43:12 <somenerd[m]> yeah
06:43:37 <noob8650> Whew, looking up the instructions for flashing grapheneos now.
06:43:44 <somenerd[m]> it's on the site lol
06:43:54 <noob8650> Should I poke around the google OS before I do it or is there nothing worth seeing there
06:43:56 <noob8650> ?
06:44:06 <somenerd[m]> update to the latest version?
06:44:34 <somenerd[m]> not really sure here sorry
06:44:38 <noob8650> (I wanted to primarily ask the second question, the first statement was but a leadup. Maybe an excuse to say I'm kind of nervous I'll brick the phone in the process)
06:44:59 <somenerd[m]> hmm
06:45:02 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Is the guide up to date or is there any detail that could screw me over?
06:45:13 <somenerd[m]> It should be up to date
06:46:00 <somenerd[m]> (but I'm kinda not that experienced with this, pls bear in mind)
06:46:08 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Okay. It should all work on void linux, right?
06:46:20 <noob8650> somenerd[m]: Okay, but it'll be alright I bet
06:46:27 <noob8650> Gotta be bold sometimes :D
06:46:32 <somenerd[m]> yeah
06:46:45 <somenerd[m]> check the instructions on the website, should be fine :)
06:51:36 <noob8650> It would be ironic if installing it from windows is more convenient than linux
06:51:56 <noob8650> But from a glance I am already seeng windows stuff.... Oh well, I'll see, gotta eat now though.
06:57:17 <majonyemima[m]> Iâm interested in seeing a comparison chart for various options in mobile security.  Something geared toward the informed consumer.  Iâd like to see comparisons in selling points between purism, e foundation, pixel with graphene and anything else on the market.  Anyone know?
07:02:06 <majonyemima[m]> * Iâm interested in seeing a comparison chart for various options in mobile security.  Something geared toward the informed consumer.

07:02:10 <noob8650> majonyemima[m]: I don't know of anything else other than maybe pinephone. Maybe you can be the one to bring such a chart to life after you finished your reasearch?
07:03:48 <noob8650> The quick of it: librem: expensive, didn't deliver as well, apparently some degree of shadiness in the company, if you trust the comment of one of its lead developers that quit because of that. e-foundation (never heard of it) pixel with graphene - well I am here so obviously. It's the option I am chosing. PinePhone: basically a developer toy with very little battery-runtime, to say it in a mean way.
07:04:08 <noob8650> There is also fairphone, if you are interested in not having the blood of toiling children in your phone
07:04:12 <majonyemima[m]> Iâm a total noob and completely broke.  But if there is a way to get funding for the phones I would be more than happy to write about my experiences and make a comprehensive comparison chart.
07:06:39 <majonyemima[m]> E foundation is an OS, really.  But I do not know much about it at all.  The website just looks interesting.  https://e.foundation/
07:07:19 <majonyemima[m]> <noob8650 "The quick of it: librem: expensi"> Thanks for that summary...  taking notes.
07:08:40 <noob8650> majonyemima[m]: Okay, so you are talking to another noob here. Librem *is* expensive, pinephone is the polar opposite. What makes librem special and expensive is, that they are trying to shift the entire software ecosystem. They are apparently building software and their OS from the ground up to be "efficient" which also means, they don't want you to buy new phones as ofen.
07:09:08 <noob8650> majonyemima[m]: The only way you're going to make a decision you like is reading around on it for some time, I'll give you a few sources I found pivotal for me
07:09:31 <renlord[m]> Please take this to the off topic channel
07:09:47 <noob8650> Pinephone delivers more cheaply, they seem to have their stuff figured out, their notebooks (and smartwatches) are pretty cheap too, they know how to supply, plan and produce it seems
07:09:49 <somenerd[m]> yeah
07:09:59 <noob8650> renlord[m]: S-sorry, I got carried away
07:10:25 <noob8650> majonyemima[m]: I'll log in on matrix and message you there.
07:12:03 <majonyemima[m]> <renlord[m] "Please take this to the off topi"> No prob.
07:12:22 <majonyemima[m]> <noob8650 "majonyemima: I'll log in on matr"> Ok.  Thanks.
07:14:56 <majonyemima[m]> Still interested in learning about graphene, btw.  Itâs just one part of the more general research that I need to do.
07:16:08 <noob8650> majonyemima[m]: I am pretty much on the same boat. You can buy a used phone and make sure that its bootloader isn't permanently locked. I think this is the most "practical" approach to have security/privacy on a smartphone. But always keep in mind that most of the privacy part is habits and rituals that you do or don't do.

08:31:54 <yarimob838[m]> Thanks
09:00:28 <yarimob838[m]> So... should I update to Android 11 from Android 10 before beggining the process of installing GrapheneOS?
09:01:04 <yarimob838[m]> "It's best practice to update the stock OS on the device to make sure it's running the latest firmware before proceeding with these instructions. This avoids running into bugs, missing features or other differences in older firmware versions. Early Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL bootloader versions use a non-standard unlocking system not covered by these installation instructions. "
09:01:04 <yarimob838[m]> I have a 3a XL, so I don't have to worry about blocking my way with an update, right?
09:01:28 <somenerd[m]> yeah I think you should
09:02:58 <yarimob838[m]> Just over the Android UI? I read some matter of "sideloading", but this just refers to the 2nd gen, right?

09:04:09 <somenerd[m]> not sure, sorry
09:04:48 <yarimob838[m]> Okay, I bet it's not an issue though, since the distro I use is rolling release and should have close-to-the-newest version
09:06:13 <majonyemima[m]> <noob8650 "majonyemima: I am pretty much on"> Not sure how to do that.  Going to the other chat room....
09:06:58 <somenerd[m]> yeah cool
09:08:17 <yarimob838[m]> majonyemima: This is what you do NOT want to see: https://i.postimg.cc/JhvPjDb5/image.png   (the option about bootloader greyed out)
09:09:12 <yarimob838[m]> That said, as long as the phone isn't carrier locked (to hell with verizon) it should work. I bought my phone from MediaMarkt and it wasn't carrier locked and I was able to unlock the bootloader in dev-options after connecting it to a wifi AP

09:24:17 <yarimob838[m]> >toggle on the 'Enable OEM unlocking' setting. This requires internet access on devices with Google Play services as part of Factory Reset Protection (FRP) for anti-theft protection.
09:24:17 <yarimob838[m]> This is why I need to briefly connect before unlocking. It's against thievery. If my phone was stolen in transit then the thief would probably try to flash another OS too, so when he tries to unlock this is a last ditch effort to catch them if they aren't connecting over tor or anything.
09:24:31 <yarimob838[m]> But I bet there's gonna be data-mining too

09:43:47 <yarimob838[m]> fuchs: Ride the GNU/Tiger haha
09:44:42 <yarimob838[m]> sc5atf2qmddjm1e0tv4r_nvxi9btqemcz7o96hsvi5k3wt2vp_ux3bj3l0-7rokhwkghqdvxlwq3zlpx0fs38c30fmhhjjch8g5y4ab7ing82me6km-bzkzwagzhwvkr: It's OT, but where did that username come from?
09:46:00 <nscnt> fuchs[m]: Just because it's labeled as GSF-dependent, doesn't mean it doesn't work. Only way to be sure about it's working/not working is testing
09:46:56 <fuchs[m]> <yarimob838[m] "sc5atf2qmddjm1e0tv4r_nvxi9btqemc"> This is actually his password.
09:46:59 <yarimob838[m]> fuchs: Yeah, basically what nscnt says, it could also be, that simply - your discord "new message" notification doesn't work.
09:47:27 <yarimob838[m]> fuchs: The absolute madlad (are you joking)?
09:49:53 <fuchs[m]> yarimob838: no, i tried it and it is not doing anything. I know that apps are Wirkung without play services but in this case not?
09:49:58 <fuchs[m]> * yarimob838: no, i tried it and it is not doing anything. I know that apps are Wirkung without play services but in this case not
09:50:12 <fuchs[m]> <yarimob838[m] "fuchs: The absolute madlad (are "> Sry, what?
09:50:57 <fuchs[m]> But yes, should be just a joke. ð
09:51:08 <yarimob838[m]> fuchs: Oh, that's sad to hear. Bug them a little about depending so much on Gservices and try to find an alternative I guess ðï¸
09:51:21 <yarimob838[m]> <fuchs[m] "But yes, should be just a joke. "> Haha okay.
09:51:51 <alzxjm[m]> fuchs: which apps?
09:52:30 <fuchs[m]> yarimob838: unfo. There is no alternative for this APP because its made for a single reason Form one companie.
09:53:09 <fuchs[m]> <alzxjm[m] "fuchs: which apps?"> Local firefighter notification system
09:53:11 <yarimob838[m]> Ah shit
09:53:39 <yarimob838[m]> That really sucks. Maybe there is a way to bridge a VM that runs it to your phone or some workaround I don't know of?
09:55:36 <fuchs[m]> Dont know either but will figure it out. ð
09:56:17 <yarimob838[m]> fuchs: Good luck!
09:57:00 <yarimob838[m]> Maybe you can ask them or somehow get in contact with the devs? Even if it leads nowhere, alone having bugged them about it is already making a slight shift.

10:11:19 <oirjorgriugriugh> Hi
10:12:59 <alzxjm[m]> Yeah I bet that's unintentional.
10:15:54 <oirjorgriugriugh> Huh?
10:16:07 <alzxjm[m]> <oirjorgriugriugh "Hi"> ð
10:16:17 <alzxjm[m]> Hi.
10:17:10 <yarimob838[m]> <oirjorgriugriugh "Hi"> Hi, what are you trying to get solved? Maybe even I can help you haha
10:18:12 <oirjorgriugriugh> I need the off-topic channel man
10:18:24 <oirjorgriugriugh> Please patch me through
10:18:36 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
10:19:38 <oirjorgriugriugh> Boof!
10:21:25 <oirjorgriugriugh> Actually, I have a question. When I try to update my apps on Aurora, WebKit doesn't update. Why?
10:22:45 <nscnt> oirjorgriugriugh: It gets updated through the os updates
10:23:23 <oirjorgriugriugh> Oh
10:23:33 <louipc> yea its part of the base OS
10:23:36 <nscnt> It's diffently signed on Aurora than the one on GrapheneOS. GrapheneOS provides WebView through Vanadium which is shipped with the os
10:23:59 <oirjorgriugriugh> That suits me, I just sit back and let Micay sort it out.
10:25:53 <alzxjm[m]> oirjorgriugriugh: just blacklist it in Aurora
10:29:38 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> Wait isn't the webkit/webview now is Vanadium's?
10:29:50 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> It shouldn't even ask for update on Aurora Store
10:31:10 <oirjorgriugriugh> And updates are automatic OTA, right? I don't have to manually install?
10:31:22 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <oirjorgriugriugh "And updates are automatic OTA, r"> Yeah
10:31:42 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> Vanadium Trichrome and components should update there
10:32:10 <oirjorgriugriugh> "There" being OTA?
10:32:20 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> Yes
10:33:42 <yarimob838[m]> I just downloaded and verified bonito-factory-2020.10.23.04.zip and now it tells me to "start into bootloader mode".
10:33:42 <yarimob838[m]> How do I do this? I pressed Power and Volume Down, I have this fastboot-mode screen. The device State is "locked".
10:33:42 <yarimob838[m]> What do I have to do?
10:34:29 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> grapheneos.org/install
10:34:38 <oirjorgriugriugh> Oh good, appreciate that. The last time I tried to install anything was Graphene OS itself and that little prick from Techlore practically bricked my phone! And when I reached out for support, I've been ignored to this day.
10:35:24 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> The instruction is there, but assuming you have the adb and fastboot on path (can be configured systemwide, or temporarily in terminal/powershell), fastboot flashing unlock is first (coming from oem unlocked stock os)
10:35:38 <yarimob838[m]> sc5atf2qmddjm1e0tv4r_nvxi9btqemcz7o96hsvi5k3wt2vp_ux3bj3l0-7rokhwkghqdvxlwq3zlpx0fs38c30fmhhjjch8g5y4ab7ing82me6km-bzkzwagzhwvkr: I am on that page. I just don't see where to run thi "fastboo flashing unlock" command. In terminal on my linux box?
10:36:07 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "sc5atf2qmddjm1e0tv4r_nvxi9btqemc"> Yes, bash. But don't do it if the $PATH part is not yet set
10:36:19 <yarimob838[m]> It just says < waiting for any device >
10:36:45 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "It just says < waiting for any d"> Ah, is it plugged well? Should be near the motherboard
10:36:47 <yarimob838[m]> And what about adb? I just installed android-tools
10:36:49 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> The usb port
10:37:04 <yarimob838[m]> sc5atf2qmddjm1e0tv4r_nvxi9btqemcz7o96hsvi5k3wt2vp_ux3bj3l0-7rokhwkghqdvxlwq3zlpx0fs38c30fmhhjjch8g5y4ab7ing82me6km-bzkzwagzhwvkr: It's a laptop
10:37:11 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "And what about adb? I just insta"> Ah, shouldn't suppose to get it there
10:37:13 <yarimob838[m]> I just took its usb-c port
10:37:23 <yarimob838[m]> oh shit
10:37:42 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0 "grapheneos.org/install"> The instruction page should explain enough, worth trying to read this few times and trying first
10:38:19 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> One can either download the files from browser or use curl, depends where you are comfortable
10:39:45 <yarimob838[m]> Damnit, I don't have linux on my desktop.
10:39:58 <yarimob838[m]> Should I use a USB2.0 interface?
10:40:05 <yarimob838[m]> I do have that on my laptop.
10:40:58 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "I do have that on my laptop."> Nah, should be good on a laptop
10:41:26 <yarimob838[m]> So I should get a USB-A cable and not use the USB-C port on the laptop?
10:41:26 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "Should I use a USB2.0 interface?"> Can't really tell, usb2.0 might be better choice due to compatibility (take this with grain of salt)
10:41:59 <yarimob838[m]> I was hoping someone here could help oof. Oh well.
10:43:07 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "So I should get a USB-A cable an"> Nah, should be fine too
10:43:19 <yarimob838[m]> But the USB-C port on my 2019 Laptop should be properly implemented, right? It's an Asus VivoBook
10:44:19 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <yarimob838[m] "But the USB-C port on my 2019 La"> Probably, try it again? Unsure what fastboot command was used to test beforehand
10:44:35 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> it's something like fastboot getvar (forgot the exact syntax)
10:46:01 <yarimob838[m]> It's just waiting for a device when connected, no matter how I get into the bootloader screen. I can't unlock it, even though OEM Unlocking has been enabled in the settings.
10:50:27 <yarimob838[m]> The Linux package "android-tools-29.0.6_3                    Android platform tools (adb and fastboot)" should be everything I need, no? This specific version was even the version requested from the user in the instructions. :/
10:53:15 <dazinism> yarimob838: you need to follow the instructions on the website closely and it should all work ok
10:53:34 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: Okay, then I am just too dumb heh
10:53:43 <yarimob838[m]> *being too dumb
10:54:09 <dazinism> Start at the top and go through it l in ne by line
10:54:16 <dazinism> Line by line
10:54:36 <dazinism> Sounds like your distros fastboot is to old
10:54:54 <yarimob838[m]> Yeah, but I connect the phone, hold power+volDown and then type "fastboot flashing unlock" in my cmdline in linux, it just waits for any device
10:54:57 <nscnt> 30.0.4 is latest
10:55:24 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: So android-tools-29.0.6_3  is too old? Whew okey
10:55:45 <dazinism> When you follow the commands open one terminal, keep only that terminal open,
10:55:49 <yarimob838[m]> Where do I get the newest version? Using voidlinux and used the package manager to get the older version I have now.
10:55:54 <dazinism> Enter all command there
10:56:15 <nscnt> yarimob838[m]: Everything's written in the guide
10:56:48 <dazinism> Follow the instructions in the guide. Its all there and will work
10:57:58 <yarimob838[m]> Should I uninstall the package-manager sourced android-tools? Just got the newest from https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools ?
10:58:59 <nscnt> Yes, that would be ideal
10:59:28 <yarimob838[m]> Hah okay. Man whats the point of having the tool in the pkg-manager if it's too old to use?
11:01:30 <yarimob838[m]> How do I "use" this new android-tools I just downloaded? Do I have to make it?
11:03:35 <nscnt> yarimob838[m]: Why do you give the impression that you're just unwilling to read? Everything's carefully explained in the guide
11:04:08 <yarimob838[m]> Can I just add it to the PATH temporarily? I don't like the idea of copying it straight to /usr/bin
11:04:26 <nscnt> ?!
11:04:39 <yarimob838[m]> nscnt: Okay, I will see if there are other pages than the https://grapheneos.org/install page
11:05:10 <nscnt> I'm afraid you're not trolling
11:05:33 <yarimob838[m]> nscnt: Sorry, I was blind
11:06:06 <yarimob838[m]> Just saw the commands to do it now. curling is in progress.
11:06:29 <yarimob838[m]> S-sorry. I kinda installed it via my package manager and skipped that part and got lost from there like a true idiot.
11:09:47 <yarimob838[m]> Though in my defense I have to say: it's even now still "<waiting for any device>"
11:12:10 * yarimob838[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/imCbEUSFCvcsXhMYnUYQcqHk/message.txt >
11:13:12 <yarimob838[m]> Do I have to run it as sudo?
11:13:55 <dazinism> Maybe if you don't have udev rules set
11:14:27 <dazinism> Actually. ... not sure on your distro
11:14:40 <yarimob838[m]> Those are my bane. I really don't want to produce an expensive paperweight here, which is why I am so insecure.
11:15:12 <dazinism> If you are definately in fastboot the other issue could be your usb lead or port
11:15:19 <yarimob838[m]> Using void linux
11:15:42 <yarimob838[m]> Okay, I'll get a type-A cable and connect to the USB2.0 port (it's a laptop)
11:15:42 <dazinism> USB a to usb c tends to be more reliable
11:15:43 <nscnt> dazinism: I guess he doesn't have udev
11:16:05 <nscnt> Didn't read that probably
11:16:33 <dazinism> Lots of pc/laptops have poor quality USBC port implementation
11:17:22 <yarimob838[m]> nscnt: > It must be at least 29.0.6. You can use a distribution package for this, but
11:17:22 <yarimob838[m]> My version was that and I just installed from the manager from there
11:17:27 <dazinism> ....think most all of this is written in the guide.....
11:18:20 <yarimob838[m]> Yes, I read about the USB ports in the guide. I was unsure again.
11:19:46 <nscnt> I've never flashed from a linux distro. If you don't have udev rules set, you probably need to run fastboot as root. udev rules are recommended, though. It's written in the guide
11:20:24 <yarimob838[m]> Well screw me, running as sudo works. Must really have been the udev rules. God I hate it.
11:20:40 <yarimob838[m]> Here's just hoping running as sudo doesn't mess up anything else.
11:21:06 <nscnt> It's all written in the guide. Please just read it. Maybe stop right now and read it from top to bottom first
11:22:30 <nscnt> And ask specific questions if you've got some; *after* you read the guide
11:24:28 <yarimob838[m]> nscnt: I did read "adb. android-udev provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root." so here's the specific question: all udev does is allow me to run the fastboot flashing unlock command as non-root, right? So using sudo is equivalent? Where do I get the proper udev rules when I don't use Arch?
11:26:52 <nscnt> yarimob838[m]: No it's not the same. If you run sudo, you're running the command as root.
11:28:27 <yarimob838[m]> And that is what I'm worried about. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android_Debug_Bridge
11:28:27 <yarimob838[m]> I also read on secondary forums, that "USB-Debugging" needs to be active. The guide only mentions enabling OEM-Unlocking. What's up with that?
11:28:57 <dazinism> Usb debugging enables adb
11:29:09 <dazinism> Dont need adb for fastboot
11:29:21 <yarimob838[m]> Okay, thanks for clearing that up!
11:29:21 <nscnt> Just follow the guide. Don't use any other "recommendations"
11:29:38 <yarimob838[m]> Then I just need to figure out the udev rules.
11:33:10 <dazinism> If you've already run a command with sudo, and it works, probably might as well just use that rather than getting udev set up
11:33:49 <dazinism> *run a fastboot command
11:34:27 <nscnt> That would've been my suggestion, too, but whatever
11:35:40 <yarimob838[m]> nscnt: Okay, I just thought that I would be risking something if I run with sudo
11:35:53 <yarimob838[m]> Thanks for the patience and sorry for being ELI5
11:43:17 <yarimob838[m]> It's doing something and flashing a bunch of stuff. I am seeing the fastbootd screen!
11:45:20 <yarimob838[m]> Do I... just wait now? I am not reading any mention of this screen in the install instructions page. Do I just have to wait until the commandline is done? I am back at the prompt, so it is done with the flash-all.sh script now, right?
11:45:40 <yarimob838[m]> Can I just lock it again now? Was that all?
11:47:16 <yarimob838[m]> Because I heard people locked themselves out, so is there any way I can test before locking it again? How do I know I didn't mess it up?
11:48:26 <yarimob838[m]> I took a leap of faith and started it in an unlocked state. I can see the GrapheneOS screen! This is so cool.
11:50:07 <yarimob838[m]> So... am I safe to lock it?
11:50:41 <yarimob838[m]> It landed me at the setup screen now. So I can just go back to the bootloader and lock it, right?
11:57:07 <yarimob838[m]> I am in GrapheneOS. So I can lock it again now and there won't be any bad surprises? I guess I'm fretting over nothing. I'll do it now.
11:57:31 <renlord> yea
11:57:39 <dazinism> yarimob838: yeah go do fastboot flashing unlock and then you all set :)
11:57:50 <yarimob838[m]> *lock
11:57:50 <yarimob838[m]> Right?
11:58:10 <renlord> lock, yes
11:58:28 <dazinism> You spotted my deliberate mistake
11:58:30 <BenchTed[m]> <yarimob838[m] "I took a leap of faith and start"> Lol
11:58:39 <dazinism> And pass the test
11:59:01 <yarimob838[m]> BenchTed: Well it *is* cool, is it not? Sorry, my first time doing this.
11:59:08 <somenerd[m]> <dazinism "You spotted my deliberate mistak"> lol
11:59:28 <BenchTed[m]> Lobe the emotional description there
11:59:40 <somenerd[m]> yarimob838: did you flash it?????
11:59:46 <somenerd[m]> I just came rn
11:59:48 <BenchTed[m]> Almost like you are hacking into Pentagon or something
11:59:49 <yarimob838[m]> It warned my my "device is loading a different os", is this completely normal or is some sort of signature not right?
11:59:50 <somenerd[m]>  * I just came here rn
12:00:05 <yarimob838[m]> somenerd: Yes :D
12:00:05 <BenchTed[m]> * Love the emotional description there
12:00:27 <dazinism> Its normal and good
12:00:33 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: Yes :D
12:00:33 <somenerd[m]> cool :D
12:01:02 <dazinism> For best security set up auditor now
12:01:15 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: Okay, I'll do that!
12:01:27 <dazinism> https://attestation.app
12:01:45 <BenchTed[m]> Do you see changing numbers falling from top in lines?
12:02:29 <coffeebag[m]> Someone Knows how can i modify .bp file in order to include .so libs INTO the apk itself
12:02:30 <dazinism> If doing the remote/online attestation best to use a email address that you won't access via the phone....
12:02:56 <dazinism> But setting up anything now is better than nothing
12:03:14 <dazinism> Can set up Auditor pairings later
12:03:53 <yarimob838[m]> BenchTed: heh
12:04:31 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: Okay, I'll get informed about the auditor and how it works.
12:07:00 <dazinism> Its neat and adds an extra layer of defense/warming against persistent explotation above the massive benefits of verified boot.
12:07:16 <dazinism> *defense/warning
12:08:07 <dazinism> Best to set up a pairing before theres any chance of the device being exploited (installing any apps etc.)
12:10:14 <somenerd[m]> and even before connecting to the inter net
12:13:12 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: I guess it's bad practice to use my old, broken Phone as an Auditor, right? It's huawei, so I'm not too confident
12:14:04 <yarimob838[m]> It was already an adventure to get the GrapheneOS device to scan the broken screen of my old phone haha
12:14:04 <yarimob838[m]> I literally have no backlight and had to shine on it with a white paper behind the semi-transparent screen
12:15:41 <yarimob838[m]> *using a flashlight
12:18:17 <dazinism> It's probably not ideal, but if you can get auditor on it via the Play store you are reasonably safe. Would need to be quite a targeted attempt to exploit you.
12:18:48 <yarimob838[m]> Okay.
12:19:00 <dazinism> Guess doing a factory reset on the other phone first would give advantages
12:19:08 <yarimob838[m]> But if I understand correctly I can always start a new "chain" later, right?
12:19:43 <yarimob838[m]> How do I know if my initial attestation result was "okay"?
12:19:58 <yarimob838[m]> It didn't warn of anything, just mirrored the settings I had on the device itself.
12:20:00 <dazinism> Unless you think a sophisticated adversary is trying to attack you, you will most likely be fine
12:20:14 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: Well I don't think that. Just curious.
12:21:19 <dazinism> You should get a result screen on the Huawei
12:21:35 <yarimob838[m]> I did, and it displayed the settings I used in Graphene
12:21:45 <dazinism> Gives you some info about the Pixel
12:21:50 <yarimob838[m]> And that it's "unmodfied", same HW, same version
12:21:51 <yarimob838[m]> etc
12:22:21 <somenerd[m]> isn't there remote attestation?
12:25:15 <dazinism> Displayed what settings you used? In graphene where?
12:25:29 <yarimob838[m]> Should I take note of the boothash or anything?
12:25:45 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: Yes, it shows the settings I used and similar things.
12:26:08 <dazinism> No need, the huawei remembers everything
12:26:24 <dazinism> If you do it again you should get a green screen
12:26:30 <dazinism> Which confirms the hey are paired
12:26:39 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: How risky is it that I used huawei.. theretically?
12:26:53 <dazinism> And that result is very secure/well verified
12:26:57 <yarimob838[m]> *theoretically
12:27:08 <dazinism> Not very
12:28:11 <yarimob838[m]> I repeated it, same results.
12:28:11 <dazinism> Someone would have had to of set things up in advance knowing you were going to do this. Serve you a dodgy version of auditor
12:28:34 <yarimob838[m]> A lot of things to go wrong, okay. Then I understand it approximately.
12:28:54 <yarimob838[m]> I've never seen anything like this, it's awesome.
12:29:02 <somenerd[m]> auditor?
12:29:11 <somenerd[m]> or the whole OS?
12:29:18 <yarimob838[m]> Well, OTP maybe is similar
12:29:33 <yarimob838[m]> somenerd: I am just taken aback a little by the whole thing, yes.
12:29:46 <somenerd[m]> hmm
12:29:53 <yarimob838[m]> In a good way
12:31:03 <somenerd[m]> seems good then
12:31:19 <yarimob838[m]> :D
12:31:54 <somenerd[m]> :D
12:41:20 <yarimob838[m]> So.... I am not in developer mode anymore, my bootloader should be locked again, right?
12:42:40 <yarimob838[m]> Will I always get the "your device is running a different operating system" warning when I boot up the phone?
12:43:46 <Knull[m]> <yarimob838[m] "Will I always get the "your devi"> yup
12:44:09 <Knull[m]> <yarimob838[m] "So.... I am not in developer mod"> I think you have to lock it
12:44:30 <yarimob838[m]> Knull: So the "OEM-bootloader unlocking" option persists beyond installs?
12:44:45 <yarimob838[m]> And I have to enter the "developer options" one more time, right?
12:47:08 <Knull[m]> in adb, you run >fastboot flashing lock
12:47:52 <Knull[m]> and OEM disable in dev options, yeah
12:48:16 <yarimob838[m]> Knull: But I already did that
12:48:24 <yarimob838[m]> The fastboot part at least
12:48:45 <Knull[m]> ok, yeah that's the bootloader
12:49:23 <yarimob838[m]> Okay, cool. Then the setting does persist. I wouldn't be asking these questions if I knew how a phone worked haha. Sorry
12:52:32 * yarimob838[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iPsZBEfHfwRjODwZdMmVpKRP/message.txt >
12:53:11 <yarimob838[m]> 8)Deactivate the Unlock OEM feature in OEM
12:53:11 <yarimob838[m]> (You will still be shown "your phone is booting another OS" each time, regardless of this)
12:54:04 <Knull[m]> looks right to me. you following some YouTube video or graphene install instructions from their site?
12:54:57 <yarimob838[m]> The Graphen Instructions, though these instructions only seem to mention running the adb lock command, no mention of entering developer options again, as far as I can tell, so that's why I'm asking.
12:55:24 <yarimob838[m]> But OEM Unlocking was still enabled, so I think it was the right thing to do.
12:55:28 <somenerd[m]> > looks right to me. you following some YouTube video or graphene install instructions from their site?
12:55:28 <somenerd[m]> yeah yarimob838 follow the website ones
12:55:34 <somenerd[m]> (if you aren't)
12:56:12 <yarimob838[m]> Already am, but there there's only the mention of relocking with adb and using authenticator, no mention of changing system settings.
12:57:27 <somenerd[m]> oh cool, sorry
12:57:41 <yarimob838[m]> So... what is the right thing to do?
12:59:18 <dazinism> Don't think it massively matters either way. Locking it guards against someone getting your phone and possibly using fastboot to flash a zero day
12:59:52 <yarimob838[m]> So the OEM unlock is just a preliminary that sits entirely in-system for all I care?
13:00:02 <dazinism> Then leaving it for you to use it again
13:00:48 <yarimob838[m]> The adb commands is the only matter of concern then, right?
13:01:01 <yarimob838[m]> s/commands/command
13:01:12 <dazinism> Leaving it unlocked could maybe help you save some data if something went terribly wrong.
13:01:25 <yarimob838[m]> Oh...
13:01:59 <yarimob838[m]> Is there any way to exit developer mode again by the way? Because I had to enter developer mode to deactivate OEM unlocking again.
13:02:16 <dazinism> Theres a toggle at the top
13:02:29 <dazinism> Safest to turn that off
13:02:52 <yarimob838[m]> dazinism: The OEM-unlock or developer options?
13:03:09 <dazinism> Developer
13:04:03 <yarimob838[m]> Good, both OEM unlock and Developer settings are deactivated again. That's the "right" way, no? And how would OEM unlock help in recovery? How risky is it to not have it?
13:04:04 <dazinism> I think the OEM unlocking is less likely to make a difference in any likely situations either way. Bit more secure when locked.
13:04:24 <yarimob838[m]> *risky in terms of not being able to recover.
13:04:29 <dazinism> I could be misunderstanding stuff. I tend to lock it
13:04:48 <yarimob838[m]> Okay, then I will just leave OEM-unlock DISabled.
13:04:56 <Knull[m]> yeah, I'd just lock it if I was you
13:05:00 <projectmoon> Having it unlocked allows you to run arbitrary things from fastboot
13:05:14 <projectmoon> There's not really a reason to leave it unlocked
13:05:47 <yarimob838[m]> projectmoon: Are you talking about the system-settings bit? Sorry, it's hard for me to differentiate the lingo.
13:06:09 <projectmoon> I'm taking admit OEM unlock, also known as bootloader unlocked
13:06:09 <dazinism> Talking OEM unlocking
13:06:23 <projectmoon> * I'm taking about OEM unlock, also known as bootloader unlocked
13:06:35 <yarimob838[m]> Okay, then I understood it yey
13:08:14 <projectmoon> I'd also leave the developer settings off unless you actually need them
13:08:27 <projectmoon> And definitely don't leave USB debugging on
13:10:19 <yarimob838[m]> Okay
13:10:47 <yarimob838[m]> I never even activated the USB debugging options, or are they activated secondarily by something else?
13:12:10 <projectmoon> It's not activated unless you turn it on explicitly. It's useful for getting debug logs, among other things. But it also gives shell access to the phone
13:12:33 <yarimob838[m]> Ah yes, so I'd only have activated it if I were a dev.
13:12:56 <projectmoon> Yes, or if you need it for some other reason
13:13:02 <yarimob838[m]> (or did it on purpose, but I didn't stray from the tutorial). Ah darn, I'll check the dev options again.

14:54:39 <sc5atf2qmddjm1e0> <molliae[m] "8kong: I am using GOS on a pixel"> For 4a users, how do you verify that the OS is not a bad image?
14:57:12 <strcat[m]> sc5atf2qmddjm1e0tv4r_nvxi9btqemcz7o96hsvi5k3wt2vp_ux3bj3l0-7rokhwkghqdvxlwq3zlpx0fs38c30fmhhjjch8g5y4ab7ing82me6km-bzkzwagzhwvkr: verify the signature of the images
14:57:15 <strcat[m]> follow the install guide
14:58:16 <strcat[m]> using Auditor to verify post-installation is a supplemental thing, not the main way you verify the images, which is through retrieving them from the official site (which is HTTPS only and you can verify that the certificate matches our key pinned in DANE) and then verifying the signature of the factory images
14:58:47 <strcat[m]> as explained by the Auditor documentation (https://attestation.app/about) it is based around a Trust On First Model and the initial verification is a weak one depending on the attestation root
14:59:00 <strcat[m]> the initial verification is useful, but that's not really what the app is based around
14:59:27 <strcat[m]> the point of the app is to provide strong verification of the identity and integrity of the device after the initial pairing
14:59:43 <strcat[m]> i.e. verifying it was not deeply compromised / tampered with after that point

15:57:19 <strcat[m]> Partyush: apps can only see which apps are installed in a profile btw, and for apps targeting API 30+ they need to include a list of which apps they can see (or the blanket query all apps permission if they want to see all within the profile) so it's possible to see what the app is able to see from the apk
15:58:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq has relevant sections but only covers some specific topics

16:07:26 <Partyush[m]> method*
16:08:27 <strcat[m]> Partyush: Play Store requires API 28+ for all new apps and all updates to apps, soon it will require API 29+ (before end of year)
16:08:38 <strcat[m]> Partyush: GrapheneOS gives a warning when launching an app with API < 28 for the first time
16:08:53 <Schnyd> I went through these steps on a previously on a different machine but I was getting the fastboot too old error. I'm hoping setting up fresh will resolve.
16:08:53 <strcat[m]> which is increased from warning for API < 23 like AOSP / stock
16:09:14 <strcat[m]> we chose API 28 because it has important sandbox improvements and is what the Play Store mandates for all new and updated apps
16:09:21 <strcat[m]> so all apps that are maintained should be API 28+ by now
16:09:50 <Partyush[m]> <strcat[m] "Partyush: Play Store requires AP">  I didn't actually logged in to my play Console from last 8 months at that time it was 26+
16:09:58 <strcat[m]> of course abandoned projects won't be, but anything capable of being uploaded to the Play Store is API 28+ already
16:10:33 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/target-sdk
16:10:40 <strcat[m]> in a few days API 29+ is required
16:11:18 <strcat[m]> apps drag their heels on moving to new API level especially those that want to do privacy invasive things or which don't respect user consent
16:11:34 <strcat[m]> (which includes supposedly privacy-friendly apps that think they know better than users about access to their data, etc.)

16:16:00 <strcat[m]> it's a cross-platform way to refer to the current directory (`.`) and `/` is a standard path separator that works on Windows too
16:17:35 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: are you using PowerShell or cmd.exe?
16:17:57 <Partyush[m]> <strcat[m] "it's a cross-platform way to ref"> May be i might be wrong
16:18:07 <Schnyd> command line
16:18:23 <Schnyd> sorry, cmd
16:18:54 <strcat[m]> Partyush: ./foo.exe works fine on Windows
16:19:06 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: okay, that's the issue, the instructions say to use PowerShell and are written for PowerShell
16:19:16 <strcat[m]> they tell you how to set up PATH in PowerShell, not cmd.exe
16:19:33 <strcat[m]> cmd.exe instructions would be different
16:19:33 <Schnyd> I'll give powershell a shot.
16:19:53 <strcat[m]> the `$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"` command it has you run is a PowerShell command
16:20:05 <strcat[m]> doing that in cmd.exe would be a different command
16:20:13 <strcat[m]> so your PATH is not going to be set up properly
16:20:50 <strcat[m]> I was asking you to run `fastboot --version` the other day to test that and I think the problem is you changed your directory into `platform-tools` so you were just running it out of the current directory, not from `PATH`
16:20:53 <strcat[m]> it doesn't tell you to change your directory like that
16:21:15 <strcat[m]> so the script is giving you the error because you don't have fastboot available for other programs to use via PATH
16:21:51 <strcat[m]> you worked around not having PATH set up correctly by changing into the platform-tools directory, but that deviated from the instructions and won't work for running the script
16:22:19 <Schnyd> do i run the path command in the platform-tools directory and the flash-all.bat from that same directory?
16:22:28 <strcat[m]> Partyush: on Windows, you can still run an executable with /path/to/executable.exe including ./executable.exe
16:22:51 <strcat[m]> Partyush: it just has a special feature where it has a list of file extensions to check in the current directory to run programs
16:23:16 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: just follow the install guide as it says, don't add any commands
16:23:31 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: you're running commands like `cd` not listed there
16:23:56 <strcat[m]> it never says to go into the platform-tools directory
16:24:21 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools it says to download it, extract it and include it in PATH
16:24:54 <strcat[m]> and then `fastboot --version` should work *without* going into the directory as you did
16:25:18 <strcat[m]> you worked around not setting up PATH by going into the directory which it doesn't say to do - that's the problem, you need PATH set up for flash-all
16:26:02 <Schnyd> so do I just enter commands from which ever directory powershell defaults to?
16:26:08 <strcat[m]> Partyush: so for example if you have the standard configuration where bat, exe, etc. are on that list of special file extensions you can run `'flash-all` (no extension) and it will find `flash-all.bat` in the current directory - but some people have those file extensions removed from that configuration
16:26:17 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: yes, that's fine
16:27:01 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: I'd just remove the directories and do it again although you don't really have to do that (you could just pick up from where it started to go wrong)
16:27:39 <Schnyd> would a reboot be needed after setting up the environment?
16:27:45 <strcat[m]> no
16:27:59 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: the command only sets the path for the current shell, it is not a persistent change
16:28:08 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: if you open up a new shell it won't have the change to path
16:28:19 <strcat[m]> it's deliberately done in a non-invasive way that doesn't install anything or change any persistent settings
16:28:52 <strcat[m]> if you wanted a persistent installation of fastboot this would not be the way to do it, you should install the standalone SDK or Android Studio which will keep itself updated
16:28:52 <Schnyd> okay that is what I thought.
16:28:52 <joltman[m]> I've seen some youtube videos that tell you to put everything into that platform-tools directory to avoid having to set path variable. dubious advice.
16:29:12 <strcat[m]> joltman: that's just bad advice based on not understanding PATH
16:29:35 <joltman[m]> agree
16:29:38 <strcat[m]> when you actually install CLI utilities on Windows via an installer they can just set up PATH persistently on your behalf
16:29:49 <Schnyd> PS C:\Users\schny> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
16:29:50 <Schnyd> fastboot --version
16:30:03 <Schnyd> Doesn't seem to resolve the issue. I must still be missing something here.
16:30:09 <joltman[m]> i almost commented that, if you can't handle setting an environment variable, then you probably shouldn't be running GrapheneOS
16:30:19 <strcat[m]> Schnyd: did you download and extract platform-tools in that directory?
16:30:44 <strcat[m]> fastboot --version should work fine after including that directory in env:$Path
16:31:16 <nscnt> joltman[m]: I think that's not too fair. A lil gate keeping c:
16:31:30 <Schnyd> ah no, its still in the other directory. I'll go back to square one offline. i'll check back later if I'm still having issues. Thanks.
16:32:13 <busysec[m]> how long will it before 4a 5G will have an experimental image ready? I'm just trying to figure out what and when to buy.
16:32:50 <joltman[m]> that's why i didn't say it
16:33:00 <nscnt> ^^
16:33:51 <nscnt> It's easy to loose touch with the difficulty of a topic if you're used to all of it
16:35:54 <strcat[m]> busysec: there are not currently any developers / maintainers working on support for either the Pixel 4a 5G or Pixel 5
16:36:15 <strcat[m]> we're working on finishing support for the Pixel 4a and there are not currently concrete plans to start on work for other devices - people would need to step up to do that and start on it
16:37:30 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a 5G is a totally different device from the 4a with more in common with the Pixel 5
16:37:43 <strcat[m]> it should really be called the Pixel 5a, I am aware their naming is confusing
16:37:57 <busysec[m]> Thanks strcat . I'm new to the graphene development timelines. Are we talking about 3 or 6 or 9 months before something would be released?
16:38:09 <strcat[m]> busysec: it's not being developed
16:38:25 <makingaliasesisa> indefinite as of rn
16:38:33 <strcat[m]> people need to step up to develop and maintain support for the device
16:38:37 <nscnt> so 2 months? /s
16:38:44 <strcat[m]> right now it's not happening, no one is working on it
16:38:52 <strcat[m]> each device needs a maintenance team
16:38:58 <strcat[m]> we still need more help for the Pixel 4a
16:39:56 <strcat[m]> we'd also likely want to wait until after the first quarterly maintenance release of Android 11 to add the 4a 5G / 5 but that is not really a timeline for anything happening just something we need to actually start doing official support for it
16:40:01 <strcat[m]> people do not need to wait for that to start working on it
16:40:05 <ruski[m]> what sort of things do you need to do or know to maintain?
16:40:08 <busysec[m]> so if I would want to make the switch to graphene withing the next 3-6 months then the smartes thing is to just get the 4a?
16:40:27 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a is the best device to get right now
16:40:43 <strcat[m]> in another few weeks we should have full 4a support that we consider fully production ready / complete
16:40:59 <spathionema[m]> strcat: what music player do u recommend
16:41:01 <strcat[m]> i.e. Auditor finished, any important device-specific issues that are discovered dealt with
16:41:18 <strcat[m]> spathionema: I don't have app recommendations, not something I can do
16:41:44 <busysec[m]> what constitutes a team for each phone? I might be able to donate some time.
16:41:47 <spathionema[m]> strcat: do u have a sense of what most people use?
16:41:54 <strcat[m]> not really
16:42:37 <strcat[m]> busysec: anyone can help with it but there has to be at least 1 person who is able to deal with a broad range of different things, learn new codebases as needed, figure out challenging problems
16:42:43 <strcat[m]> busysec: and that's committed to long-term support for the device
16:43:03 <strcat[m]> there is not any specific requirement on what a maintenance team is
16:43:11 <strcat[m]> but there has to be at least 1 person we can rely on to deal with most of the work
16:43:32 <somenerd[m]> any requirements for dev (i.e programming languages, experience)?
16:43:38 <strcat[m]> the initial work would be getting working builds of AOSP for the device with verified boot, custom vendor.img build, etc.
16:43:53 <strcat[m]> there are not requirements like that
16:43:54 <ruski[m]> spathionema: you can ask in off topic. my fav is vlc
16:43:55 <strcat[m]> the main requirement is being able to learn lots of things as needed
16:44:04 <joltman[m]> it also makes a big difference if you typically stream music versus storing your own music on the device. off-topic room is a better place to ask.
16:44:27 <strcat[m]> device maintenance involves dealing with lots of unfamiliar code as needed
16:44:49 <strcat[m]> I do not expect people to have background that is particularly relevant to it other than being experienced programmers able to learn what is necessary as needed
16:45:06 <busysec[m]> strcat: who is a good person to talk to if I want to volunteer for some aspects ?
16:45:53 <strcat[m]> I'm teaching aeonsolution and he can teach you what he knows so far
16:46:02 <strcat[m]> Matrix is messing up and reordering messages etc.
16:46:06 <strcat[m]> really annoying
16:46:17 <somenerd[m]> probably lag
16:46:34 <somenerd[m]> because I type one message, and it takes a bit of time
16:46:47 <strcat[m]> think it was actually just an Element UI bug reordering messages, reloading it seems to have resolved it
16:47:23 <makingaliasesisa> somenerd: I think it is matrix.orgs server
16:47:37 <somenerd[m]> it probably is
16:47:40 <somenerd[m]> they need to improve that
16:47:46 <strcat> it's the official matrix server in general that's really slow and buggy
16:47:59 <strcat> it's not specific to matrix.org, matrix.org just has a lot of users that makes it more apparent
16:48:06 <nscnt> I can't forget when one of my messages was pinned at the bottom of the riot app permanently
16:48:08 <makingaliasesisa> It was bad for me a couple of days ago about this time
16:48:34 <strcat> nscnt: yeah that was just happening to me, it reordered my messages and kept showing them below what I was typing in random orders
16:48:37 <makingaliasesisa> > it's not specific to matrix.org, matrix.org just has a lot of users that makes it more apparent
16:48:38 <makingaliasesisa> true
16:49:01 <strcat> nscnt: every time I sent a message, it'd randomly reorder 3 other messages I sent below it
16:49:03 <strcat> weird stuff
16:49:35 <strcat> I tend to type in element instead of weechat because I tend to be using the browser
16:49:49 <strcat> also don't always have weechat open
16:49:53 <strcat> but element / matrix really annoy me
16:50:34 <strcat> the irc bridge also has other problems, I really don't like how it kicks people if they don't interact with the irc bridge for 30 days - meaning you get kicked for lurking for 30 days if you don't send any messages
16:50:37 <somenerd[m]> it lags
16:50:47 <strcat> you may have noticed matrix ends up mass kicking people via the irc bridge bot
16:50:49 <somenerd[m]> and in the browser it just scuffs up
16:51:03 <strcat> so the channel would actually be a lot bigger if matrix didn't keep kicking all the people lurking
16:51:04 <somenerd[m]> > you may have noticed matrix ends up mass kicking people via the irc bridge bot
16:51:04 <somenerd[m]> yeah it kicks people
16:51:16 <somenerd[m]> and makes it really hard to lurk
16:51:21 <strcat> basically if they don't interact with the irc bridge for 30 days, kicked
16:51:31 <strcat> so if you just join and read channel regularly but don't send messages it kicks you
16:51:33 <strcat> I can't disable it
16:51:41 <somenerd[m]> > and in the browser it just scuffs up
16:51:41 <somenerd[m]> like literally loses session keys
16:51:50 <somenerd[m]> at random times
16:52:07 <strcat> I verified my sessions with each other so I can recover it via syncing
16:52:16 <somenerd[m]> hmm
16:52:18 <strcat> just have to verify again
16:52:18 <somenerd[m]> I keep a key
16:52:28 <strcat> yeah you can also just verify one session with the other and then it will sync
16:52:34 <somenerd[m]> hmm
16:52:37 <strcat> you don't need the recovery key if you have more than one session
16:52:45 <somenerd[m]> I should do that, thanks for the idea!
16:52:52 <strcat> like Element in 2 different browsers (in my experience the app-based element is a lot more buggy)
16:53:14 <somenerd[m]> > like Element in 2 different browsers (in my experience the app-based element is a lot more buggy)
16:53:14 <somenerd[m]> that doesn't spell well for it
16:53:23 <somenerd[m]> because even in the browser it's kinda laggy
16:53:32 <nscnt> We really do have reocurring themes here. FUD > user support > actual dev infos > wtf is matrix doing?! > FUD > ... :D
16:53:36 <strcat> the app isn't more laggy but it's really buggy and less complete
16:53:43 <somenerd[m]> > like Element in 2 different browsers (in my experience the app-based element is a lot more buggy)
16:53:43 <somenerd[m]> which ones work the best?
16:54:00 <strcat> just Element in a Chromium-based browser is probably most stable
16:54:11 <strcat> I have on session on my Linux workstation and another on my Windows desktop
16:54:21 <strcat> I removed the app from my phone because it was too broken and bothering me
16:54:39 <strcat> one session*
16:54:41 <somenerd[m]> wonder why it was out of beta then...
16:55:03 <somenerd[m]> > We really do have reocurring themes here. FUD > user support > actual dev infos > wtf is matrix doing?! > FUD > ... :D
16:55:03 <somenerd[m]> lol
16:55:03 <strcat> Matrix is making a new server implementation which should make things a lot less laggy
16:55:23 <strcat> the issue is basically that they implemented the server more as a proof of concept than a long-term maintainable and scalable server
16:55:50 <makingaliasesisa> ah ok
16:56:02 <strcat> it's written in Python which makes it really hard to maintain a large project and that's the source of a lot of the performance issues (not just the language performance but the difficulty of maintaining / refactoring)
16:56:23 <strcat> not a language I would choose to implement anything like that
16:56:37 <strcat> but I guess the developers were most familiar with it and it helped them be productive to use what they know
16:56:54 <somenerd[m]> maybe this is getting slightly off topic
16:57:22 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/build#programming-languages
16:57:28 <strcat> well it is relevant to the project in various ways
16:57:33 <strcat> and the project has an official position on this stuff
16:57:45 <somenerd[m]> these are the preferred ones?
16:57:48 <somenerd[m]> ok
16:58:29 <somenerd[m]> is there a C replacement but more stable and secure?
16:58:45 <strcat[m]> it talks about that there
16:58:52 <somenerd[m]> oh
16:59:05 <somenerd[m]> nvm rust is there
16:59:17 <somenerd[m]> should've taken an actual look other than the headings
18:13:38 <fuschia[m]> Heyo. So I've got an issue with GPS currently. Running a pixel 3 on the latest release.
18:13:38 <fuschia[m]> No apps are able to determine location, even after enabling location services through settings. I have run the gamut of turning off all services and rebooting the device with no luck. Any support would be appreciated
18:19:22 <dazinism>  .ð¯: may need to go outside for a bit so the device can get a good signal from the satellites and set everything up (needs to download stuff)
18:19:26 <dazinism> This can be handy
18:19:35 <dazinism> GPSTest (An app for testing GPS and GNSS capabilities of a device) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.android.gpstest.osmdroid
18:19:55 <dazinism> Can take a few minutes outside to set everything up.
18:20:44 <dazinism> * This can be handy for seeing whats going on.
18:26:25 <renex> A question, is it somehow possible to record video and also have the phone locked?
18:27:42 <Partyush[m]> Hello sorry for a bad questions.
18:27:43 <Partyush[m]> Does eSIM work on pixel 4a with graphene os ?
18:33:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
18:49:48 <dazinism> renex: just tried Open Camera and if your videoing and lock, it stops, but if you then tap the power button you can restart while the phone is lockes
18:49:51 <dazinism> *locked
18:50:26 <dazinism> *if you are videoing
18:55:57 <Partyush[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "No"> Any idea why?
19:00:42 <renex> dazinism: thanks
19:06:26 * dar_gomml[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/WDgtoezLgVLoxYEzrVfvSDEJ/message.txt >
19:10:21 <strcat[m]> renex: yes, by default, camera access on the lockscreen is permitted, there's a toggle for it in the security settings
19:10:27 <strcat[m]> renex: use the double tap power shortcut to launch the camera there
19:10:48 <strcat[m]> it's possible to show a camera icon on the lockscreen (which is hidden when camera access there is disabled) but we don't change it to show that
19:16:34 <deafboy> Anyone else unable to use private dns server (DoT)?
19:19:24 <mmcblk0[m]> https://nethemba.com/sk/ako-si-maximalne-zabezpecit-smartfon/
19:23:40 <deafboy> I've used dns guard as mentioned in the articke, but switched to blah dns recently. None of them are working right now. I've tried multiple internet connections in case it's filtered on network level.
19:23:52 <deafboy> *article
19:32:46 <joltman[m]> I personally turn off lock screen access to camera. I don't really use camera that way and it just invites mischief.
19:38:30 <deafboy> It's funny. I've tried to cycle through several DoT providers, and now it's working according to dnsleaktest.com. The android still says "Couldn't connect" under the "Private DNS" option though.
19:44:19 <strcat[m]> it will say that if there are connection errors
19:44:35 <strcat[m]> if it can't connect at all then you won't have working DNS since there's no fallback outside automatic mode
19:58:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> PSA: do not buy the black Friday pixel 5 offer. There is no way to unlock the bootloader
19:58:50 <louipc> from google?
19:59:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's actually being sold by Verizon
19:59:35 <louipc> oh yea hehe
20:05:37 <joltman[m]> Maybe Google will have their own Pixel 5 black friday deal
20:06:45 <alzxjm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "PSA: do not buy the black Friday"> Could you clarify? I bought the Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 4 XL as part of the Google store Black Friday promos. They were unlockable.
20:07:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Could you clarify? I bought the "> What went on sale right now is being sold by Verizon
20:20:29 <ruski[m]> finally installed on my pixel 4a. i feel like some part of secret club now :D
20:22:17 <faxing[m]> <ruski[m] "finally installed on my pixel 4a"> Good job! You are, very exclusive, very cool.
20:23:31 <ruski[m]> i am now very cool guy, approved by stallman, snowden, assange
20:32:16 <alex-resist> I also temporarily have a 4a, will install GrapheneOS and see if I find anything unusual
20:33:28 <snowfur[m]> Hey, does someone know an adb command to re-enable the camera per policy?
20:35:20 <snowfur[m]> * Does someone know an adb command to re-enable the camera per policy?
20:41:23 <alex-resist_> So, the 4a has this punchhole camera. It's a first for me. Does the OS "know" that there is a camera and will spare it out, or will elements sometimes end up "behind" the camera?
20:43:21 <projectmoon> it renders the screen behind the camera
20:43:31 <projectmoon> but the time and notifications is to the right of the punch hole
20:43:38 <projectmoon> are*
20:45:07 <alex-resist_> Ok thx. It's really... weird
20:47:03 <alex-resist_> The punchhole seems to be located in the status bar most or all of the time, so at least there's that
20:57:14 <projectmoon> i like it. better than a notch
20:57:28 <projectmoon> the UI deals with it correctly, if that's what you're wondering
20:58:54 <alex-resist_> I think I just have to get used to it.
21:00:50 <alex-resist_> Oh and 16:9 videos are shifted slightly towards the bottom of the phone (if in horizontal mode)
21:05:10 <alex-resist_> I'm getting this error: "Setting current slot to 'b'                        FAILED (remote: 'Changing slot with snapshot applied may cancel the update.')"
21:13:04 <alex-resist_> It failed quite early in the flashing process, the stock Android could recover successfully
21:20:10 <alex-resist_> Maybe I should wait until all tasks have finished, especially after the previous OTA update (of stock Android)
21:22:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <alex-resist_ "I'm getting this error: "Setting"> Yeah this is a very annoying issue
21:22:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> So do this
21:22:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Extract the sunfish image and get the boot.img
21:23:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> ```
21:23:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot flash boot boot.img
21:23:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then use the volume buttons to select recovery mode
21:23:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> And boot to recovery
21:23:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to sideload grapheneos OTA now
21:23:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> When done wipe user data from recovery and try to boot
21:24:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> In some cases you might still boot back to the stock ROM so you'll have to run the factory image again. It should work that time
21:24:20 <alex-resist_> Do you know what caused it? Because I'm back in stock
21:24:26 <alex-resist_> Nothing is broken
21:24:52 <alex-resist_> I think I waited a too short period of time after the last OTA update
21:25:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well this is something you broke
21:25:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> You didn't wait long enough for it to mark the system update as successful
21:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> What am I supposed to say
21:25:57 <alex-resist_> I mean I waited a couple of minutes
21:26:12 <alex-resist_> And with a fresh 4a thousands of notifications are coming and going
21:26:24 <alex-resist_> Maybe there should be a warning somewhere that people should wait at least for a couple of minutes
21:26:36 <alex-resist_> like 5 or 10
21:26:59 <alex-resist_> Anyway, I'm back in working stock. Should I just try again?
21:29:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do what I have said
21:31:39 <alex-resist_> I think I misunderstood what you wrote. I have to follow your instructions above even if stock is still working?
21:32:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just do it
21:32:19 <alex-resist_> Ok
21:32:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> What I'm trying to do is make the recovery mark that an update happened
21:32:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> After that if it boots
21:32:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then the snapshot flag the bootloader is talking about is cleared
21:33:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> And if it doesn't, the upgrade is marked as failed and the bootloader clears that flag anyway
21:33:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> You have to wipe user data in recovery before flashing
21:33:38 <alex-resist_> Ok, what I did is flash boot.img and booted to recovery
21:33:48 <alex-resist_> Now the screen says "no command". What next?
21:34:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Press power
21:34:34 <alex-resist_> (Also I'm downloading sunfish OTA rn)
21:34:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> And while holding power press volume up
21:34:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to press volume up after you have pressed power
21:34:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> First wipe user data
21:35:54 <alex-resist_> Stock booted again. I think I pressed power for too long
21:36:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can try fastboot reboot fastboot too
21:36:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Select enter recovery from there
21:37:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then go to wipe data/factory reset
21:37:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Choose factory data reset
21:37:43 <alex-resist_> I'm again at the "no command" screen. I tried power + volume up but last time it just rebooted stock. How long do I have to hold those buttons?
21:37:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't hold volume up
21:38:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're supposed to hold power
21:38:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> And just press volume up
21:38:11 <alex-resist_> Ok, so hold power, and just briefly press volume up?
21:38:13 <alex-resist_> Ok
21:38:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
21:38:29 <alex-resist_> That doesn't do anything, I'm afraid
21:39:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then go to bootloader and try
21:39:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> fastboot reboot fastboot
21:40:13 <alex-resist_> That worked, thanks
21:40:22 <alex-resist_> Now I'm at the fastbootd screen with the usual recovery commands
21:40:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Enter recovery then
21:40:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then choose wipe data/factory reset
21:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Confirm the reset
21:40:56 <alex-resist_> Doing it right now
21:41:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then select apply update from adb
21:41:08 <alex-resist_> Wait
21:41:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> And sideload the file you downloaded
21:41:41 <alex-resist_> It said "Wiping Titan M" and then "Can't send spi message: Try again" about 25 times. In the end it still said "Data wipe complete"
21:41:43 <alex-resist_> Is that ok?
21:42:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah that's a known bug
21:42:26 <alex-resist_> Ok good
21:42:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can bug Google about it
21:42:41 <alex-resist_> And then just adb sideload?
21:43:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
21:43:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> You need to specify the filename
21:43:18 <alex-resist_> Yes I'm familiar with that
21:43:25 <alex-resist_> It's sideloading right now
21:43:40 <alex-resist_> I know it's frustrating when users know 50% and they don't know the other 50%
21:44:34 <alex-resist_> I know a lot about heimdall and adb, still have to get used to the fastboot world though
21:45:24 <alex-resist_> So what should happen next? Reboot?
21:48:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
21:49:04 <alex-resist_> Ok, GrapheneOS booted
21:49:20 <alex-resist_> Thanks for your patience and the explanation
21:49:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then you can go and lock
21:50:15 <alex-resist_> Is this now the complete OS, equivalent to the factory images? There was no way to use signify with the OTA image, but apart from that it should be identical?
21:50:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
21:51:10 <alex-resist_> Excellent, thanks again! Lesson learned :)
21:51:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah but you haven't locked the bootloader yet
21:51:45 <alex-resist_> I know, that's fine
21:52:13 <alex-resist_> This device is not for me, someone wants to use it with Calyx. I'm just having it for a day or two, then I will flash Calyx, lock it and give it to that person
21:52:26 <alex-resist_> I just wanted to try out Graphene on it
21:53:40 <alex-resist_> It seems faster than my personal 3a XL, which is not surprising I guess
21:56:48 <alex-resist_> It's very satisfying to have excellent software on good hardware
22:02:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> [alex-resist_](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_alex-resist_:matrix.org) well good luck
22:02:16 <BeingFrey[m]> Hello GrapheneOS hive!  I'm wondering if anyone is aware of a mobile app/service that would allow me to send / receive SMS text msgs via mobile and/or computer?
22:02:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just remember that downgrading from 11 to 10 is not really supported
22:02:50 <alex-resist_> Stock was already on 11, so I would have had that problem anyway
22:03:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> [alex-resist_](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_alex-resist_:matrix.org) convert him to grapheneos
22:05:52 <alex-resist_> Different users have different usecases... You wouldn't believe how often people approach me with the request that banking apps absolutely *must* work on their phones. For those people Graphene isn't an option
22:08:24 <alex-resist_> As long as they're getting Pixels, they can of course switch later :)
22:13:01 <joltman[m]> I tested the Wells Fargo banking app (via Aurora) and it worked fine.
22:13:42 <BeingFrey[m]> <joltman[m] "I tested the Wells Fargo banking"> Good to know.  US Bank works well too.  Citibank flakes.
22:13:42 <alex-resist_> Push TAN apps usually don't work, but I guess that's off topic
22:14:48 <Dylanger[m]> > banking apps
22:14:48 <Dylanger[m]> These almost always require Key/ID Attestation (SafetyNet)
22:14:59 <Dylanger[m]> At least, if the Bank is decent
22:20:02 <DanielleMigay> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heVNcdq2MKA
22:20:11 <DanielleMigay> 7.02 - 7.37
22:23:13 <louipc_> hmm
22:24:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Fucking techlore
22:40:26 <Cube[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Fucking techlore "> What's wrong with techlore?
22:41:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Cube[m] "What's wrong with techlore?"> He constantly attacks and spreads misinformation about grapheneos while pretending to care
22:42:18 <Cube[m]> I see - just watching that section of the video
22:43:14 <Cube[m]> That was a bit excessive
22:43:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> He has some this repeatedly
22:44:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> He also goes and personally defames developers
22:44:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> * He has done this repeatedly
22:44:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> That work on grapheneos
22:46:51 <Cube[m]> * That was a bit dramatic
22:59:51 <anonhat[m]> Quick question. What kind of executable space protection is utilized in gOS? Is it enforced system-wide, including with third party applications, or just in limited circumstances?
23:08:41 <madaidan[m]> <anonhat[m] "Quick question. What kind of exe"> W^X is only enforced in the base system right now. A toggle for applying W^X to third party apps is planned but not currently implemented.
23:13:11 <Dylanger[m]> <DanielleMigay "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="> Who is this? Is this the guy in the vid?
23:13:43 <Dylanger[m]> Also are there no mods?
23:14:10 <Dylanger[m]> anupritaisno1: How are you not a mod?
23:15:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just didn't care I guess
23:17:40 <anonhat[m]> He's basically saying it's better to feel secure than to actually be secure. And gimme back muh Google, I'm tired of having privacy.
23:50:30 <snowfur[m]> <DanielleMigay "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v="> He kind of compared CalyxOS to GrapheneOS the both have different focuses (I think) GrapheneOS has Security and CalyxOS mostly Usability (it seems like) and the whole Video he kind of trash talked GrapheneOS (it seems to me this way)
23:53:28 <snowfur[m]> <anonhat[m] "He's basically saying it's bette"> He probably likes convenience a lot more
23:54:20 <redibc[m]> When you flash graphene on a phone does it delete everything ever installed in it prior? Let's say you had a phone with malware would it gry rid of it?
23:55:45 <snowfur[m]> <redibc[m] "When you flash graphene on a pho"> As long as the malware isn't on the hardware (which is very hard as far as I know) then yes
23:56:21 <redibc[m]> Okay
23:56:49 <redibc[m]> So you would have to take the phone apart and replace the hardware to surveil it?
23:57:12 <snowfur[m]> I think Pixel locks the Hardware so it can't be reflashed so this Attack would be hard to do
23:57:28 <snowfur[m]> * I think Google Pixel locks the Hardware so it can't be reflashed so this Attack would be hard to do
23:59:01 <redibc[m]> Do you think the nsa tries to break graphene or is finding ways to get past certain encryption? What about quantum computing in the future
