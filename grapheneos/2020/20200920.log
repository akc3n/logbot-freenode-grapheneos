00:00:08 <lickidysplit-pti> Tiz the only way I can think of
00:00:13 <lickidysplit-pti> VPN then tor.
00:00:23 <lickidysplit-pti> So ur ISP can't see you are using TOR
00:00:33 <lickidysplit-pti> But your VPN provider can.
00:00:48 <bypassbobby[m]> I don't know who I trust more haha
00:00:48 <lickidysplit-pti> So its a matter of who do you trust more?
00:01:08 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: You run the VPN as normal
00:01:22 <lickidysplit-pti> You in a 5eyes country?
00:01:24 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: And then you point individual apps at the orbot socks port
00:01:43 <bypassbobby[m]> Yes 5 eyes
00:02:05 <lickidysplit-pti> üò∑
00:03:17 <bypassbobby[m]> <jpds "bypassbobby: And then you point "> By selecting apps in orbot?
00:03:34 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: No, by configuring the proxy settings within the app
00:03:47 <bypassbobby[m]> <jpds "bypassbobby: No, by configuring "> OK I get you now
00:04:37 <bypassbobby[m]> Non 5 eyes VPN is needed i run cyberghost but havnt trouble logging in so using proton
00:04:51 <bypassbobby[m]> * Non 5 eyes VPN is needed i run cyberghost but having trouble logging in so using proton
00:04:58 <nepgen[m]> ovpn is better
00:05:19 <bypassbobby[m]> Does it have device limit?
00:05:25 <lickidysplit-pti> https://mullvad.net/en/
00:06:15 <lickidysplit-pti> Has up to 5 devices share
00:06:33 <bypassbobby[m]> Then doesn't that mean its logging

00:10:57 <lickidysplit-pti> Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
00:10:57 <lickidysplit-pti> This is digital cash, so the process is the same as with physical cash but without humans or any third parties involved. We run our¬†own full node¬†in the blockchains (one for each of the cryptocurrencies) and we verify incoming payments ourselves. Again, we don't use third parties for any step in the bitcoin or bitcoin cash payment process, from the generation of QR codes to adding time to accounts.
00:11:31 <lickidysplit-pti> Pay with btc , use xmr.to if you want no chain analysis
00:11:45 <lickidysplit-pti> üëç
00:11:52 <bypassbobby[m]> I read good things about it but that device limit turns me off
00:12:15 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: Then pay for more accounts if you need more
00:12:43 <bypassbobby[m]> I don't need anymore accounts just want provider that doesn't even log amount of devices
00:13:08 <lickidysplit-pti> It's simply to enforce the 5 device limit I believe
00:13:09 <bypassbobby[m]> I don't have loads of devices I just see logging devices as logging
00:13:13 <lickidysplit-pti> Read the FAQ
00:13:38 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: Well, bandwidth isn't cheap and I'm pretty sure every provider does this
00:13:46 <lickidysplit-pti> All logs are deleted after 5 minutes apparently.
00:14:00 <bypassbobby[m]> <jpds "bypassbobby: Well, bandwidth isn"> There's some that don't
00:14:10 <jpds> Otherwise, people would just create one account and hand out keys to an infinite number of devices
00:14:16 <lickidysplit-pti> We store Nginx access logs for up to 5 minutes in the following format (which does not contain IPs): $server_name [$time_local] $request $status
00:14:16 <lickidysplit-pti> Information older than 5 minutes is deleted, and only aggregated information about the number of requests and their response codes is saved.
00:14:16 <lickidysplit-pti> We refrain from sending usage statistics to external parties such as Google Analytics.
00:15:08 <lickidysplit-pti> Mullivad is honesty a top contender. 99 pct of vpns will log at some level
00:15:16 <lickidysplit-pti> Weather they r transparent about it or not
00:15:57 <lickidysplit-pti> NordVPN was OK but they've removed all there socks5 proxies so they can eat a dick
00:16:28 <jpds> Anyway, this is starting to go -offtopic

02:48:18 <lickidysplit-pti> Uhhh is the 4a XL even supported by GoS yet?
02:48:39 <lickidysplit-pti> Nevermind its not the 4a. Just the 4
02:50:37 <Lia[m]> The cost though
02:50:57 <Lia[m]> The audacity of hiking the price without even donating to the main project
02:51:04 <Lia[m]> Whereas you can flash it for free
02:51:45 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah that is almost a $800 mark up on a 4
02:51:53 <louipc> wow they used to partner with copperhead tho
02:52:01 <lickidysplit-pti> For maybe an hour of work
02:52:34 <louipc> good reason to offer the same but at lower price guys
02:53:02 <lickidysplit-pti> I've applied to be a reseller for them
02:53:04 <louipc> compete them out of existence, or force them to lower price by starving them of sales
02:53:27 <lickidysplit-pti> Waiting to hear back. Hopefully I can port my closest friends over too
02:54:03 <lickidysplit-pti> Good business model haha
02:54:21 <Lia[m]> If I can start a business, I'd definitely will offer it for way lower price
02:54:44 <lickidysplit-pti> I agree though the price for a simple procedure is nuts. But in Australia most people just use flagship phones on stock OS and have no idea what big tech is doing
02:55:05 <louipc> who did you apply to be reseller?
02:55:18 <lickidysplit-pti> Why do u mean?
02:55:38 <lickidysplit-pti> The support and benefits.
02:55:38 <lickidysplit-pti> I'd get 1 of each device to work on
02:55:49 <louipc> google?
02:55:55 <lickidysplit-pti> And DAT revenue
02:56:02 <lickidysplit-pti> No
02:56:09 <lickidysplit-pti> Ncryptullar
02:56:12 <Lia[m]> The price is too much hike. Who knows where they even use it?
02:56:16 <lickidysplit-pti> No way would I work for google
02:56:33 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "The price is too much hike. Who "> has*
02:56:48 <lickidysplit-pti> I'd rather casterate myself
02:56:55 <Lia[m]> Well, they can legally do it so yeah
02:57:11 <lickidysplit-pti> üòÇ
02:57:21 <louipc> going offtopic
02:57:36 <Lia[m]> Yeah lol
02:57:49 <Lia[m]> Anyways, anybody wanna risk going to beta?
03:03:52 <null[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "I agree though the price for a s"> Aye it's true. You an aussie as well?
03:07:53 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah man
03:08:17 <lickidysplit-pti> Not Victorian thank f##k
03:22:14 <lickidysplit-pti> Downloading beta channel now. Here we go üëç
03:22:49 <null[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "Not Victorian thank f##k"> Same haha. QLD
03:24:47 <lickidysplit-pti> Sunshine state all the way mate !! üëçüëçüëç‚úå‚úå‚úå
03:40:27 <qt_pie[m]> <Lia[m] "Anyways, anybody wanna risk goin"> i will after i back up my phone
03:46:08 <Lia[m]> No need to backup
03:46:15 <Lia[m]> From cancelled beta to latest beta
03:46:19 <Lia[m]> It works well.
03:46:32 <qt_pie[m]> which pixel?
03:46:34 <Lia[m]> Besides the biometric issue, and bluetooth being on at first update
03:46:39 <Lia[m]> 3a
04:35:33 <Lia[m]> <qt_pie[m] "which pixel?"> For 3a(XL) users, the wait is worth it
04:42:49 <gamer99999[m]> hey gaymers, I had a question about the incoming pixel 5 support
04:43:10 <gamer99999[m]> roughly how long till you guys can come up with a release for it? thanks
04:44:26 <Lia[m]> When there is a dedicated maintainer for it, and the AOSP branch for that phone is released
04:44:44 <Lia[m]> 4a has no dedicated maintainer, and may as well never be supported
04:44:44 <gamer99999[m]> yea but roughly how long would that take is what I'm asking
04:44:49 <Lia[m]> No timelines
04:44:55 <gamer99999[m]> oh :(
04:45:00 <Lia[m]> No maintainer, no timeline.
04:45:18 <gamer99999[m]> so no plans for any maintainers to upg phone to pixel 5 ?
04:45:34 <Lia[m]> It's not even released
04:45:48 <gamer99999[m]> yes but it will be in a week
04:45:51 <gamer99999[m]> 2*
04:46:01 <gamer99999[m]> I'm not sure if I wanna buy pixel 4 now or 5
04:46:21 <gamer99999[m]> thats why im asking about possible support
04:46:56 <Lia[m]> Yeah, but even 4a which was supposedly budget has no support, and the latest that has support right now is 4
04:53:53 <gamer99999[m]> awww
04:58:16 <lickidysplit-pti> <Lia[m] "For 3a(XL) users, the wait is wo"> So for the 3aXL you suggest we wait? I'm about to finish installing the beta
04:58:26 <lickidysplit-pti> üò´üòÇ
05:05:01 <Lia[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "So for the 3aXL you suggest we w"> Well, if you have waited until this beta, the preview, your files will not be subject to factory reset
05:05:32 <Lia[m]> But install at your own risk and inconvenience (so far, only biometrics problem and bluetooth start at boot is seen)
05:53:32 <lickidysplit-pti> Android 11 working fine.
05:54:33 <lickidysplit-pti> Biometrics is fucked as lia said
05:54:48 <lickidysplit-pti> Bluetooth did not start on boot for me ( had airplane mode active tho )
05:59:26 <Lia[m]> Sargo?
05:59:37 <Lia[m]> I mean is it on 3a?
05:59:47 <gamer99999[m]> hey guys how long till we get support for s10 (e)
06:00:22 <Lia[m]> Until Samsung supports verified boot for alternative OS, and not break basic Android security model
06:00:33 <Lia[m]> More of never
06:01:04 <gamer99999[m]> :'(
06:01:23 <lickidysplit-pti> Hmm. One thing I'll add, it doesn't show u how long left battery life you have left? ( said battery should last for 2 days before update ) now it says just the pct
06:01:42 <lickidysplit-pti> Nevermind that just changed ü§î
06:01:44 <Lia[m]> It still says on mine
06:03:32 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah must have been because I just unplugged my dev from charger
06:03:32 <Lia[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "Bluetooth did not start on boot "> At update?
06:03:43 <lickidysplit-pti> Took a few mins and gave me a figure. Disregard that
06:03:57 <lickidysplit-pti> Yes on the A11 update
06:04:02 <lickidysplit-pti> No Bluetooth on boot
06:04:12 <Lia[m]> Sideloaded or OTA seamless?
06:04:22 <lickidysplit-pti> RP1A.200720.009.2020.09.18.13
06:04:24 <lickidysplit-pti> OTA
06:04:34 <Lia[m]> updater client!
06:04:37 <Lia[m]>  * updater client?
06:04:51 <lickidysplit-pti> Yep
06:05:18 <Lia[m]> I see, maybe that was the difference
06:05:18 <lickidysplit-pti> Was it possible ur Bluetooth got enabled during reboot
06:05:39 <lickidysplit-pti> Have u replicated it on boot
06:05:53 <Lia[m]> On reboot it doesn't do that
06:06:20 <lickidysplit-pti> Turn on Bluetooth and off, and reboot. See if Bluetooth is re enabled on start up
06:06:21 <Lia[m]> Anyways, I'm yet to find a bug (hopefully not much)
06:06:47 <lickidysplit-pti> Hmm. Possibly u just accidentally hit the Bluetooth button by accident and switched it on
06:06:57 <lickidysplit-pti> üíÅ
06:07:13 <Lia[m]> Yeah, it's why I'm waiting for somebody to reproduce it
06:07:39 <Lia[m]> Otherwise closing the issue later
06:29:40 <lickidysplit-pti> I don't like the power button options. No option to remove the emergency widget and replace it with reboot / lockdown mode. It's one or the other
06:30:06 * lickidysplit-pti uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200920-162951.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/IqhhcDPWpfbxkmbUJOctaGIW/Screenshot_20200920-162951.png >
06:30:23 <lickidysplit-pti> And no screenshot option
06:30:35 <lickidysplit-pti> Wahhhhh
06:32:53 <Lia[m]> Upstream changes
06:33:07 <Lia[m]> Blame Google for that
07:00:19 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah its an A11 feature I know.
07:00:19 <lickidysplit-pti> I figured it out. Restart is under power when u enable lock down mode
07:00:46 <cn3m[m]> I don't turn on lockdown mode
07:00:54 <cn3m[m]> reboot or power off is far more effective
07:01:43 <lickidysplit-pti> Reboot Is always first option of course because it fully encrypts again doesn't it
07:01:58 <lickidysplit-pti> On reboot and u can access any data without pin
07:02:13 <cn3m[m]> yes if you exploit the running system you can access everything in lockdown mode
07:02:14 <lickidysplit-pti> can't*
07:02:38 <cn3m[m]> which it is hard to exploit since the vast majority of attack surface is removed and the tiny sliver left is hardened
07:26:03 <matic_nick[m]> Hey guys beta user here on 3a XL. I think I found a bug on Network Manager on latest Beta build.
07:26:42 <matic_nick[m]> Switching randomized mac to device mac seems to purge connection
07:27:57 <matic_nick[m]> I have to re-authenticate if I toggle the MAC switch
07:28:44 <dazinism> That may of been like that previously, I've never tried.
07:29:24 <dazinism> Guess it'd be nice if it remembered. Maybe file an issue on github?
07:29:28 <matic_nick[m]> I'm using EAP-TLS and the cert also got purged if I switch MAC
07:31:18 <dazinism> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
07:31:25 <matic_nick[m]> <matic_nick[m] "I'm using EAP-TLS and the cert a"> I have to reinstall it each time I was testing MAC
07:33:39 <matic_nick[m]> <dazinism "https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os"> Thanks but can anyone report on my behalf?
07:34:21 <matic_nick[m]> I think MAC randomization is not working yet on latest beta build

07:38:14 <lickidysplit-pti> Wasn't there a third option also?
07:39:39 <lickidysplit-pti> I can confirm the Mac does change
07:39:54 <lickidysplit-pti> But I'm certain there were 3 options there before I updated
07:40:10 <lickidysplit-pti> Use random Mac and fully randomize Mac
07:40:24 <lickidysplit-pti> Someone correct me if I'm wrong - not using beta version ATM
07:40:34 * bobfett uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200920-094005.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/flobob.ovh/PrMoYqdiAJmidKUklkWFNiZi/Screenshot_20200920-094005.png >
07:41:01 <bobfett> Those are the options on latest stable release
07:41:01 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah... Thought so
07:41:12 <lickidysplit-pti> strcat
07:41:52 <lickidysplit-pti> Was that part of the upstream updates or something over looked ?
07:42:21 <lickidysplit-pti> I think the use randomize Mac is now use per network Mac
07:42:55 <dazinism> I see three options looking at settings for a given WiFi network
07:43:00 <dazinism> Also https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/272
07:43:22 <lickidysplit-pti> Are you on latest BETA update ?
07:43:34 <dazinism> No, on stable
07:43:35 <lickidysplit-pti> Build RP1A.200720.009.2020.09.18.13
07:43:47 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah these are only beta issues ATM
07:44:01 <lickidysplit-pti> Seems since the beta that function is gone
07:46:30 <lickidysplit-pti> <dazinism "Also https://github.com/Graphene"> Hmm
07:48:13 <lickidysplit-pti> Hopefully someone with some insight chimes in soon
07:48:22 <lickidysplit-pti> Cause I'm bloody clueless
07:57:27 <renlord[m]> it should be working
07:57:41 <renlord[m]> I tested this on pixel3a
07:58:11 <renlord[m]> lickidysplit-ptio:
07:58:16 <renlord[m]> what phone are you using?
07:59:04 <lickidysplit-pti> 3aXL
07:59:08 <lickidysplit-pti> It changes the Mac yes
07:59:16 <lickidysplit-pti> Just wondering where the other option went
07:59:31 <renlord[m]> there should be 3 options as per before
07:59:46 <lickidysplit-pti> Hmm.... What de fek
08:01:22 <lickidysplit-pti> R u using beta release RP1A.200720.009.2020.09.18.13
08:01:22 <lickidysplit-pti> Or stable?
08:01:24 <renlord[m]> lickidysplit-ptio: my last correspondence with strcat. He said that he is "working on new 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3a XL builds"
08:01:39 <renlord[m]> lickidysplit-ptio: I work on the development build LOL
08:01:48 <renlord[m]> it is as bleeding edge as it gets
08:02:01 <propertype[m]> Works for me on pixel 3a xl
08:02:22 <renlord[m]> my suggestion is to wait for that new beta release to be pushed out
08:02:46 <lickidysplit-pti> The new one again? üòù
08:02:46 <renlord[m]> unless people using pixel2* or pixel4* experience issues also
08:03:08 <lickidysplit-pti> Shit I just just loaded this A11 update hahaha, oh well
08:03:22 <renlord[m]> you can get OTA no?
08:03:40 <lickidysplit-pti> Yeah I downloaded it
08:03:53 <renlord[m]> you dont use the automatic updater?
08:04:20 <lickidysplit-pti> Beta isn't giving me any new updates.
08:04:38 <lickidysplit-pti> That's what I meant. Using seamless updater
08:05:21 <lickidysplit-pti> I just installed the newset a11 beta. An that's where I'm having these issues ( no fully randomize Mac option )
08:05:26 <renlord[m]> i think they are still getting built
08:05:41 <renlord[m]> a newer release
08:05:55 <lickidysplit-pti> Ah. So will be pushed to stable or new beta
08:05:57 <lickidysplit-pti> Roger that
08:07:30 <renlord[m]> beta
08:08:31 <lickidysplit-pti> Rogi. Sorry I'm in and out of the chats and rearly read change logs lol. Too busy but I do my best. Thanks for the awnsers
08:29:07 <Lia[m]> Odd, MAC randomization is working well on the latest preview build
08:29:15 <Lia[m]> on sargo.
08:29:33 <Lia[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "I just installed the newset a11 "> What model are you on?
08:30:39 <Lia[m]> Can't reproduce the bluetooth issue oddly

08:53:57 <lickidysplit-pti> Biometrics works unlocking device ?

09:02:35 <Lia[m]> Yeah it was a translation issue
10:00:23 <renlord[m]> that's being fixed now
10:00:24 <renlord[m]> sorry.
10:15:36 <Lia[m]> It's alright, I kinda found another issue, I can't reliably reproduce this VPN-related connection among multiple users (profiles)
10:16:24 <Lia[m]> For some reason, when VPN is connected to another profile with lockdown on, and switched to another one, the current profile can't connect when it has VPN too in lockdown
10:16:54 <Lia[m]> It's just an occasional occurrence I need to reproduce reliably firstw
10:19:12 <strcat[m]> inthewaves: perhaps related to your change? ^
10:21:04 <Lia[m]> Well, at least the fix works with my repetitive tests
10:21:40 <Lia[m]> The lockdown doesn't turn off from on when it's stopped, which is nice
10:22:14 <Lia[m]> The connection probably can't connect in two VPN opened simultaneously, probably not a bug but working as intended?
10:23:36 <strcat[m]> Lia: if you use a VPN in the main profile and enable lockdown
10:24:09 <strcat[m]> Lia: doesn't that remain as the active VPN for all the other profiles
10:24:31 <strcat[m]> owner profile is special and isn't ever logged out
10:24:48 <strcat[m]> in Android 11, other profiles get immediately logged out by default when switching away I think
10:25:00 <strcat[m]> we'd need to expose an option to allow keeping secondary profiles running in the background now
10:27:49 <Lia[m]> Well, the main profile VPN gets disconnected for some time after the other profile connects to VPN, and it takes a while before it connects again. This also stands true vice-versa, from non-main to main.
10:28:27 <Lia[m]> I will try it on LAN later to see if even a faster internet causes these issues
10:29:36 <Lia[m]> However, from non-VPN to VPN profile and vice-versa, no issues have been found. When switching profiles too quick, and opening too much apps, I accidentally reproduced home button being unresponsive which didn't happen prior to this beta
10:30:01 <Lia[m]> No tests have been done between non-main profiles
10:31:09 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia: doesn't that remain as the "> Either way, it remains active (main or not main, but I encountered that issue more when switching to main profile, oddly)
10:36:47 <fragaria[m]> for how long the pixel 2 will be supported?
10:38:42 <cn3m[m]> üçìüçìüçì: it is guaranteed support until October 2020
10:38:58 <cn3m[m]> AOSP has mentioned a few months ago they were preparing to drop it
10:39:34 <cn3m[m]> it probably will receive it's last update at the beginning of next month
10:39:55 <jpds> Is there a way I can check which version the updater downloaded?
10:44:23 <fragaria[m]> <cn3m[m] "üçìüçìüçì: it is guaranteed support"> got it, it is quite soon though
10:44:23 <Lia[m]> <jpds "Is there a way I can check which"> Not that I know of, that's why sideloading exist
10:57:27 <cn3m[m]> <fragaria[m] "got it, it is quite soon though"> yes
10:57:39 <cn3m[m]> it will be likely dropped very soon
10:57:40 <cn3m[m]> but it could go on who knows
10:58:39 <fragaria[m]> like an unofficial aosp ?
10:59:45 <cn3m[m]> üçìüçìüçì: it is not impossible Google will decide to support it longer
11:00:35 <kan12> hi, not sure if this has been reported but on the latest pixel 3a beta I get "your device is corrupted" and then "your device is loading a different operating system" before it starts up normally. not too sure if it was related to trying out the "DSU Loader" feature or something specific to this beta release.
11:00:46 <kan12> in grapheneOS
11:01:12 <kan12> I've discarded the downloaded image and I am booting grapheneOS beta but I still get that
11:03:11 <jpds> kan12: Yeah, I'm also struggling to upgrade my 3a to the preview beta
11:03:45 <strcat[m]> jpds: from which release
11:04:07 <jpds> strcat[m]: The cursed 2020.09.10.05
11:04:27 <strcat[m]> ok so maybe you'll have to wipe to upgrade from 2020.09.10.05
11:04:29 <strcat[m]> that's an issue with 2020.09.10.05
11:04:29 <fragaria[m]> [cn3m](https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io): yeah could be, but speaking of, the "legacy" word on grapheneOS website indicates that the device will be deprecated soon, isn't it?
11:04:43 <kan12> well, I could update from the latest stable release to the latest beta release just fine, I noticed this started showing up after I installed it
11:05:24 <strcat[m]> kan12: from which release did you upgrade
11:05:34 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you were on 2020.09.10.05 which was never a stable release
11:05:45 <strcat[m]> I need accurate reports from beta testers or it hurts more than it helps
11:05:51 <strcat[m]> we don't need to know about issues with 2020.09.10.05 anymore
11:06:24 <cn3m[m]> üçìüçìüçì: https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fnb0n6/pixel_2_and_2_xl_have_been_marked_as_legacy/ yes and it is a bit behind technically speaking. Bad device to buy right now. The legacy label gave people time to think about updating
11:06:28 <strcat[m]> 2020.09.10.05 was cancelled and never released to stable so it isn't relevant, only upgrading from a stable release to the current beta matters
11:06:38 <kan12> let me look it up
11:06:52 <strcat[m]> kan12: check on your device
11:06:57 <strcat[m]> don't make an assumption based on the site
11:07:02 <propertype[m]> Running the latest beta release and everything works fine so far. Bluetooth, sound, biometrics... Very nice. Running a  3aXL
11:07:05 <strcat[m]> if you've already upgraded it's too late to check
11:07:48 <strcat[m]> what I need to know is that people upgrading from a past release that was pushed out via stable to the current beta works fine
11:07:50 <kan12> i'm on RP1A.200720.009.2020.09.18.13
11:08:04 <strcat[m]> kan12: what I wanted to know is what you upgraded from before
11:08:07 <kan12> previously i was on the latest stable release
11:08:19 <kan12> so QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.11.14
11:08:27 <strcat[m]> but you're assuming that based on the site
11:08:29 <strcat[m]> you don't know that
11:08:58 <strcat[m]> also how are you checking what version you're currently using
11:09:08 <strcat[m]> are you checking it within the OS? so it boots?
11:09:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> <fragaria[m] "[cn3m](https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m"> Yes
11:09:26 <strcat[m]> did it prompt you to factory reset and you accepted the factory reset?
11:09:38 <strcat[m]> or are you stuck at being prompted to factory reset
11:09:56 <kan12> ah yeah don't think i saved the previous build number anywhere sorry, I looked at the website to check what the latest stable version was, also the updater app didn't download anything until i changed branch to beta
11:09:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Currently I really recommend anyone getting grapheneos to get the pixel 4
11:10:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is the most recent device with a proper maintainer
11:10:22 <kan12> I'm checking the current OS build version in the android settings app. It boots fine
11:10:52 <kan12> no factory reset, just when I power on/reboot it will have the red message saying "your device is corrupted" and "press button to continue"
11:10:59 <fragaria[m]> [cn3m](https://matrix.to/#/@cn3m:privacytools.io): make sense
11:11:13 <kan12> *no prompt to factory reset
11:12:54 <strcat[m]> kan12: this is on the Pixel 3a? why were you talking about "DSU Loader" before?
11:13:10 <strcat[m]> we don't support booting those GSIs
11:13:13 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Currently I really recommend any"> plus it has the best security
11:13:30 <strcat[m]> kan12: it sounds like you've configured the device to boot a GSI and we don't whitelist those keys so it's saying that it's corrupted
11:13:37 <strcat[m]> kan12: sounds like something you've configured
11:13:40 <kan12> yes pixel 3a, and "DSU Loader" is something in developer settings
11:13:47 <kan12> yeah that is most likely
11:13:48 <strcat[m]> what did you do with that
11:14:05 <strcat[m]> I'd recommend a factory reset if you can't get whatever you did with that disabled
11:14:08 <strcat[m]> it sounds like that's the issue
11:14:22 <strcat[m]> it sounds like it's trying to load a GSI and since we removed the whitelisted keys it can't do that
11:14:25 <strcat[m]> can you just turn it off?
11:14:38 <strcat[m]> in general using developer options is risky and unsupported
11:14:42 <strcat[m]> need to be careful what you use there
11:14:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): but isn't DSU userdebug only?
11:14:59 <kan12> doesn't seem like there's an actual toggle for it
11:15:04 <strcat[m]> kan12: you could try toggling off developer options as a whole
11:15:13 <kan12> yep i'll try that
11:15:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's possible to boot a GSI dynamically on the stock OS which is a user build
11:15:29 <strcat[m]> there are whitelisted keys that we've removed
11:15:48 <strcat[m]> so you can't use that on GrapheneOS
11:15:59 <strcat[m]> we should probably disable the feature as a whole instead of just removing the keys
11:16:06 <strcat[m]> haven't done that yet
11:16:38 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of things we should disable / remove that are unused
11:16:56 <strcat[m]> it's often not worth maintaining though if disabling it doesn't really accomplish anything
11:17:17 <kan12> yeah i still get that "device corrupted" message with developer mode disabled
11:17:19 <strcat[m]> so for example we don't use shared RELROs, we don't use ephemeral apps (instant apps), we don't use that dynamic GSI booting stuff, etc.
11:17:25 <kan12> think I'll just reinstall grapheneOS lol
11:17:32 <strcat[m]> kan12: just try a factory reset
11:17:37 <kan12> ok
11:17:41 <strcat[m]> kan12: or maybe figure out what exactly you did before
11:17:43 <strcat[m]> and see if you can undo it
11:17:47 <strcat[m]> maybe you ran commands with adb?
11:17:51 <strcat[m]> I don't know how that feature is used
11:17:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): why not flash both slots?
11:18:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: what do you mean
11:18:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Documentation says DSU plays with super partition
11:18:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe flashing both slots will erase DSU
11:18:31 <strcat[m]> flashing both slots isn't relevant
11:18:33 <strcat[m]> no, it won't
11:18:38 <kan12> the only things i've tried with adb since updating to android 11 are using the logcat
11:18:49 <strcat[m]> kan12: how did you enable this DSU thing
11:18:57 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/caiyvejSPIfyWfVaxxwoKRsq/message.txt >
11:18:58 <strcat[m]> what exactly did you do - I'm not familiar with how it's used
11:19:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it doesn't use alternate slots of the main partitions
11:19:12 <strcat[m]> that's unrelated
11:19:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) I don't see where else the dynamic partition could be
11:19:18 <kan12> developer options -> DSU Loader
11:19:19 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with a / b slots
11:19:32 <kan12> then choose one of the GSI images
11:19:35 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it consumes space from userdata to make a new partition
11:19:46 <kan12> it will give a notification saying it's installing then prompt to reboot
11:19:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the GSI is downloaded to userdata
11:20:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is so weird tbh
11:20:09 <strcat[m]> kan12: is there no way to undo it?
11:20:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Isn't data mounted like very late boot?
11:20:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it downloads the GSI to userdata
11:20:33 <kan12> strcat: the notification gives a "discard" option to discard the GSI which is what I did
11:20:36 <strcat[m]> then it sets it up so that the GSI is a dynamic partition
11:20:43 <kan12> and what I thought should undo everything
11:20:52 <strcat[m]> kan12: yeah I'd just try a factory reset
11:21:00 <strcat[m]> we don't support this feature, I don't know what exactly it does
11:21:14 <strcat[m]> it sounds like it's still trying to boot it
11:21:22 <strcat[m]> kan12: maybe you should actually reflash GrapheneOS
11:21:27 <strcat[m]> not just factory reset
11:21:41 <strcat[m]> kan12: we just don't have time to go through developer options and remove everything we don't support for each version
11:21:46 <strcat[m]> in general
11:21:51 <strcat[m]> don't use developer options
11:22:07 <kan12> yeah i'll just reflash the OS
11:22:08 <strcat[m]> unless it's to do some very specific thing that is known to work
11:22:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): well there is something specific
11:22:29 <kan12> and yeah, I had it enabled to speed up the window animation
11:23:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb shell gsi_tool disable
11:23:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb shell gsi_tool enable -s
11:23:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb shell gsi_tool disable
11:23:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> From the documentation
11:23:12 <strcat[m]> kan12: try that? ^
11:23:19 <kan12> btw if i'm interested in taking one of these features out of developer options so i can leave it disabled overall would that be integrated into grapheneOS or should i just make an app for it
11:23:29 <kan12> cause it's a bit silly to have to enable developer options for that
11:23:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW I really suggest trying to just flash both slots
11:24:00 <strcat[m]> it's not relevant
11:24:03 <strcat[m]> it doesn't use alternate slots
11:24:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> DSU depends on the Android Dynamic Partition feature <--- the documentation
11:24:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also devices without the super partition don't support DSU at all
11:24:37 <strcat[m]> dynamic partitions is not something to do with A/B slots
11:24:48 <strcat[m]> A/B slots != dynamic partitions
11:24:55 <strcat[m]> there are devices with dynamic partitions and no A/B
11:25:02 <strcat[m]> there are devices with A/B and no dynamic partitions
11:25:05 <kan12> tried that and just got "/system/bin/sh: gsi: inaccessible or not found"
11:25:19 <kan12> think i'll just backup my data and reinstall
11:25:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> gsi_tool
11:25:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not gsi
11:25:46 <strcat[m]> it definitely doesn't do anything with the alternate slots
11:25:53 <kan12> > Error disabling GSI
11:26:10 <kan12> have to enable it first then disable?
11:26:34 <strcat[m]> you could try that
11:27:00 <strcat[m]> ideally there's a toggle we can set in build configuration to rip out this feature completely instead of just removing the keys as we've been doing for a while
11:27:07 <strcat[m]> we don't want stuff like that especially since it's not going to work
11:27:07 <kan12> just says could not find GSI install to re-enable
11:27:17 <kan12> it's ok, I'll just reinstall the OS
11:27:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh
11:27:37 <kan12> especially if it's something the project has no plans to support
11:27:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Going to try this on my pixel
11:27:45 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it won't work
11:27:48 <strcat[m]> we disable including gsi keys
11:27:50 <strcat[m]> in our changes
11:28:03 <strcat[m]> 'disable GSI keys' commit in device repo
11:28:15 <strcat[m]> -# Installs gsi keys into ramdisk, to boot a developer GSI with verified boot.
11:28:15 <strcat[m]> -$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/developer_gsi_keys.mk)
11:28:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah but[strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org) I just want to see how it is set up
11:28:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also I'm on stock rn
11:28:33 <strcat[m]> it'd be good if you figured out if there's a way to just rip out support for it completely via a build option
11:28:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have to find some missing apks in apv for pixel 4
11:29:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lot's of stuff moved from product to system_ext
11:29:10 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: dynamic partitions is how stuff can be done like adding system_ext
11:29:13 <strcat[m]> which didn't exist before
11:29:22 <strcat[m]> dynamic partitions means they can be dynamically resized and new ones added
11:29:24 <strcat[m]> old ones removed
11:29:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> System_ext did exist on Q though
11:29:49 <strcat[m]> look at a device like Pixel 2 or 3
11:29:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just not widely used
11:29:52 <strcat[m]> which got retrofitted
11:30:01 <strcat[m]> also
11:30:05 <strcat[m]> partition sizes are dynamic
11:30:19 <strcat[m]> there is not a need to hard-wire a specific size for all time
11:30:26 <strcat[m]> if vendor has to get bigger than before that works fine
11:30:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW how is this reproducible?
11:30:41 <strcat[m]> it sets up the partitions for the OS the same way on each device
11:30:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> From how I see it every device will have a slightly unique super partition
11:30:48 <strcat[m]> it is still identical across each install
11:30:51 <strcat[m]> no
11:30:55 <strcat[m]> why would it be different?
11:31:03 <strcat[m]> when you install an update it sets up the partition
11:31:14 <strcat[m]> the only way it would be different is if you use some weird unsupported developer feature
11:31:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): users may flash to slot A or B, diff slots would be used
11:31:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> No?
11:31:28 <strcat[m]> not relevant
11:31:53 <strcat[m]> there is always space for both slots
11:32:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then won't there be people upgrading by OTA to R who won't have a system ext partition on the other slot?
11:32:09 <strcat[m]> don't know what you're talking about
11:32:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah okay I got it
11:32:27 <strcat[m]> it doesn't matter if you're on slot a or b
11:32:33 <strcat[m]> there are always both slots
11:32:42 <strcat[m]> A/B updates != dynamic partitions
11:32:52 <strcat[m]> that's a different thing
11:32:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
11:32:59 <strcat[m]> dynamic partitions means partitions can change in size or be added/removed
11:33:14 <strcat[m]> the OS partitions get redone for current slot on every update
11:33:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are xiaomi devices without A/B but have a super partition
11:33:28 <strcat[m]> every update redoes it
11:33:41 <strcat[m]> so it's 'reproducible', sure some people are on 'a' right now and others on 'b'
11:33:45 <strcat[m]> not really relevant
11:33:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "every update redoes it"> Got it
11:33:51 <strcat[m]> that's always the case
11:33:58 <strcat[m]> people can skip an update
11:34:09 <strcat[m]> and then they don't swap slots for that update since they skipped it
11:34:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the command to create the metadata is also reproducible?
11:34:25 <strcat[m]> yes, why not?
11:34:43 <strcat[m]> but if people use some weird developer feature that dynamically adds a new form of partition not covered by OS updates
11:34:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): well was confusing
11:34:53 <strcat[m]> then that is outside the scope of what is changed by updates
11:35:10 <strcat[m]> that's controlled by developer options/features
11:35:12 <strcat[m]> it's a separate thing
11:35:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like so far android used to copy partitions byte by byte so all devices were the same
11:35:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> It still does but dynamic partitions themselves are now created by a command instead of just blindly copying
11:36:04 <strcat[m]> it starts with our super
11:36:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> So I did have the question
11:37:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> By reproducible I meant can you prove the contents of the super partition as a whole on one device can match another of the same device?
11:37:15 <strcat[m]> read https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/dynamic_partitions/ab_launch
11:37:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assuming they were both flashed the same ROM from fastboot
11:37:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just read the documentation
11:37:39 <Lia[m]> Regarding the cancelled beta, there should be no issues from upgrading from i
11:37:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): will move to pm BTW
11:37:52 <Lia[m]>  * Regarding the cancelled beta, there should be no issues from upgrading from it to latest preview
11:38:06 <strcat[m]> Lia: did you?
11:38:15 <Lia[m]> Yeah, I did
11:38:22 <Lia[m]> No problems, I sideloaded it earlier
11:38:26 <Lia[m]> And my friend too
11:38:33 <Lia[m]> Both in sargo
11:38:56 <Lia[m]> Nothing asking to factory reset
11:39:56 <Lia[m]> It was worth the wait
12:09:47 <strcat[m]> ok beta is fully released
12:10:17 <strcat[m]> MAC randomization translation issue is fixed for the next release
12:10:41 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/326 is the only issue so far that still needs to be addressed
12:47:56 <derpy> how would you open a csv file on GOS?
12:49:40 <louipc> there must be some reader in fdroid?
13:03:23 <nickcalyx[m]> Libreoffice viewer
13:03:35 <nickcalyx[m]> For instance
13:06:45 <derpy> nickcalyx[m] looks like it hasn't been update for 2y on FDROID
13:08:02 <derpy> perhaps it is sufficient... just weary of 1+ year old apps for security reasons... Perhaps the devs here think oldness isn't a potential indicator of insecurities for these types of apps?
13:12:40 <strcat[m]> we don't bundle F-Droid or endorse it
13:12:47 <strcat[m]> not sure where you get that idea
13:13:09 <strcat[m]> we are explicitly not going to bundle F-Droid
13:13:24 <strcat[m]> please don't attribute issues with F-Droid to us or make it seem like we don't think they're issues
13:20:52 <derpy> Didn't mean to imply a relationship
13:21:12 <derpy> The question is more: "GOS users/dev, how would you open a CSV file?"
13:31:45 <null[m]> What do you want to do with the CSV? Just view it's contents?
13:31:45 <null[m]> It's text-based so any text editor should suffice.
13:31:45 <null[m]> Unless it's a larger CSV and you want a spreadsheet-like view? I don't know about that.
13:48:23 <derpy> null[m] ya just view it. tried some text editors but it looked like garbage upon opening... maybe I'll find a swift way to open in crypt.ee or google apps webapps... a minimal app would be ideal tho
13:49:53 <kan12> hmm if setupwizard isn't implemented in android 11 yet then there's no other way to restore a seedvault backup is there?
13:50:58 <strcat[m]> kan12: not via the GUI
13:51:02 <strcat[m]> you can launch the activity with adb
13:51:05 <strcat[m]> there's a reason it's in the beta channel
13:53:37 <kan12> thanks, i'll check that
13:55:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> kan12: I've used "Import Contacts" for this purpose (and then removed it when done)
13:55:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> ( On F-Droid =\ )
13:57:36 <kan12> might look into it, thanks
14:00:50 <dazinism> kan12: can launch any app (eg. seedvault) activities on device using https://f-droid.org/packages/com.oF2pks.applicationsinfo
14:01:54 <louipc> derpy: you could probably even use some webapp, web spreadsheet to view it. there are so many options
14:05:20 <derpy> sweet; seems like someone is trying to update libreoffice for everyone anyway: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/issues
14:06:46 <dazinism> derpy: Collabora via Aurora Store is good for office stuff. Only decent open source office suite for android.
14:07:00 <derpy> sweet tnx
14:08:53 <kan12> i'm surprised this activity launch command even worked lol
14:09:06 <kan12> thanks strcat for the hint
14:09:37 <dazinism> derpy It downloads as a split apk, which I think Aurora Store can install now. If not you'll need to use an app

14:10:46 <louipc> byby
14:11:11 <dazinism> derpy: if Aurora store doesn't install find the 3 apk files it downloaded
14:11:27 <dazinism> Then use - SAI (SAI lets you install and export split APKs) - https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aefyr.sai.fdroid
14:11:33 <derpy> dazinism it doesn't know how to open csv either haha... will look through settings... maybe open spreadsheet, then import
14:11:47 <derpy> aurora store installed it fine, from what I can see

14:30:56 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> Hi, In Windows 10 explorer I try copy pasting an .otf and .txt file into the Documents folder on my Pixel 3XL or dragging and dropping and it won't have it. If I rename one of the files .jpg it works fine then. Is there some setting to allow .otf to be copy pasted in this way, please? Is this a security related restriction?
14:34:12 <louipc> ptp vs mtp?
14:35:51 <strcat[m]> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3: there's no restriction
14:36:06 <strcat[m]> sounds like Windows has wrongly detected the device as a camera
14:36:23 <strcat[m]> make sure you're up-to-date and that Windows has installed the proper auto-detected drivers
15:07:39 <fomijafi[m]> Just rebooted into the latest release on pixel 3. No idea why but everything is very snappy right now
15:07:45 <fomijafi[m]> Maybe just my imagination?
15:11:26 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> Thanks tried it in a different PC and .otf works fine there.
15:15:53 <Lia[m]> Only the exec spawn should hit the cold app boot performance right? Does it have something to do with SELinux hardening about zygote being removed (before)?
15:22:09 <bobfett> On the latest beta build with a pixel 3xl: all seems fine (call, audio, Bluetooth, data on mobile, wifi, mms,...)
15:45:15 <strcat[m]> Lia: unsure what you mean
15:45:34 <strcat[m]> exec spawning is what causes a noticeable slowdown to cold start app spawning time
15:45:39 <strcat[m]> nothing else
15:46:00 <strcat[m]> I don't know what you're referring to in the rest of your message (what is "it" that you are  referring to?)
15:47:57 <derpy> strcat[m] should I post a bug in github concerning the video freezing on full screen playback in valadium?
15:48:09 <jkadhs8734hioaus> does someone understand the folder structure of graphenos?
15:48:13 <jkadhs8734hioaus> where is the launcher?
15:48:22 <derpy> Any YouTube video when fullscreened for a while, basically. Easy to fix by pressing power & then unlocking again
15:48:45 <jkadhs8734hioaus> where do i put an app i want to be in the build by default ?
15:49:01 <strcat[m]> it's not location in the source tree that determines that
15:49:37 <strcat[m]> doesn't really matter where you put stuff
15:49:59 <strcat[m]> the AOSP convention is that apps developed with AOSP are in packages/app and external projects are in external/ but that's nothing but a convention
15:50:00 <strcat[m]> doesn't really mean anything
15:50:17 <strcat[m]> you could just make a new top-level directory and put it in there, nested as much as you want, doesn't matter
15:54:23 <jkadhs8734hioaus> the reason is that i am trying to find the existing apps, and also adapt the conventions
15:54:41 <jkadhs8734hioaus> thanks
15:54:56 <chimeyy[m]> I'm getting the 4a soon and would like to learn more about AOSP, building + maintaining gOS and app development. Any good sources/documentation on where to start?
15:56:22 <jkadhs8734hioaus> can't find the graphene os launcher folder
15:58:38 <strcat[m]> packages/apps/Launcher3
15:58:48 <jkadhs8734hioaus> ty
16:06:59 <jkadhs8734hioaus> why is it called Launcher3 and not GrapheneOS launcher?
16:07:52 <strcat[m]> we don't rename the repository
16:08:24 <strcat[m]> the name of the repository doesn't do anything
16:09:17 <jkadhs8734hioaus> oh i see
16:09:58 <jkadhs8734hioaus> do i have to build the launcher before building the rom?
16:10:07 <jkadhs8734hioaus> if i replace it with another?
16:15:00 <strcat[m]> no you can do either
16:15:10 <strcat[m]> you can either include an app to be built as part of building the OS using the AOSP build system
16:15:27 <strcat[m]> or build it separately and include it as a prebuilt
16:15:47 <gamer99999[m]> hey guys roughly how long after pixel 5 releases will we a lineageOS port ?
16:15:50 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't touch Launcher3 repo at all if you just want to replace it with another
16:16:00 <strcat[m]> gamer99999: not on-topic
16:16:09 <gamer99999[m]> ?
16:16:16 <strcat[m]> this isn't a LineageOS channel
16:16:28 <gamer99999[m]> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
16:16:30 <gamer99999[m]> sorry
16:16:40 <gamer99999[m]> matrix is confusing man
16:17:25 <jkadhs8734hioaus> so there is also a prebuilt apk of the launcher3 ?
16:17:44 <strcat[m]> no
16:17:45 <jkadhs8734hioaus> just trying to understand how the build process uses apk's and android projects
16:17:54 <jkadhs8734hioaus> ok
16:18:08 <strcat[m]> apps developed as part of aosp are built with the aosp build system
16:18:17 <strcat[m]> it is possible to include prebuilt apks that are built externally
16:18:23 <strcat[m]> you can do it either way
16:18:40 <jkadhs8734hioaus> how about keyboards?
16:18:44 <jkadhs8734hioaus> where are they?
16:18:45 <strcat[m]> the reason you would use a prebuilt apk is if you are building an app that uses a different build system
16:19:47 <strcat[m]> the generic location for apps developed as part of AOSP (and built with the AOSP build system) is packages/apps
16:20:12 <strcat[m]> packages/inputmethods is where keyboards are that are developed as part of AOSP and built with the AOSP build system since they have a more specific location
16:20:21 <strcat[m]> anything developed externally generally goes in external/
16:20:27 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia: unsure what you mean"> Does exec spawn have any relation to zygote domains in SELinux policy?
16:20:35 <strcat[m]> Lia: I don't know what you mean
16:20:38 <jkadhs8734hioaus> check. thank you heaps.
16:21:03 <strcat[m]> Lia: what kind of relation? why are you asking about this?
16:21:24 <Seplx[m]> Does anyone know how I would go about obtaining the proprietary binaries for the LA.UM.8.6.2.r1-08400-89xx.0 caf tag (as an example)?
16:21:30 <strcat[m]> exec spawning doesn't require any SELinux policy changes because the SELinux policies already support it
16:21:46 <strcat[m]> Seplx: you don't
16:22:03 <strcat[m]> Seplx: you get the sources for the proprietary components from your partnership with Qualcomm
16:22:10 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm doesn't give you binaries
16:22:30 <Seplx[m]> Ok thank you.
16:23:02 <strcat[m]> so there aren't generic binaries since they're built by the OEM for their phone optionally with whatever changes they want
16:23:55 <Lia[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia: what kind of relation? why "> I am unsure what does this commit before: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_system_sepolicy/commit/03b9b2d953a2ff26030a0de554b39bd223ce8c66 has to do with exec spawning. I am probably missing something, sorry if I asked something trivial or has disturbed you
16:24:19 <strcat[m]> Lia: it has no connection to exec spawning
16:24:58 <Seplx[m]> <strcat[m] "Seplx: you get the sources for t"> So my best bet is extracting them from a google phone?
16:25:15 <strcat[m]> Seplx: only if you want them to run on that phone
16:25:54 <strcat[m]> and that will have their changes for their devices
16:26:02 <strcat[m]> and I don't know what the corresponding CAF tag would be
16:26:12 <strcat[m]> there isn't really one
16:26:18 <strcat[m]> there would be one that they started from
16:27:32 <Seplx[m]> Thank you
16:27:48 <jkadhs8734hioaus> Has anyone removed the google logo? feels better if there is no google logo at startup
16:27:52 <jkadhs8734hioaus> where to start?
16:33:30 <nickcalyx[m]> Not sure but I think that's in hardware
16:34:06 <Seplx[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Not sure but I think that's in h"> No
16:57:36 <derpy> Supposed to see the "this phone is loading a different OS" msg at every boot, right?
16:57:44 <strcat[m]> yes
16:57:56 <strcat[m]> jkadhs8734hioaus: make a phone where you set the bootloader image to a different value in your signed firmware
17:00:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "so there aren't generic binaries"> Actually there are
17:01:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are a couple OEMs that don't modify those binaries at all
17:01:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> And also OEMs often leak their internal engineering builds
17:01:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> They often have almost generic binaries from CAF
17:02:22 <strcat[m]> they're intended to build it AFAIK
17:02:27 <strcat[m]> the main SDK gives you a source tree
17:02:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): oh that
17:02:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> LA.UM.8.6.2 source was accidentally leaked by an OEM
17:03:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> So you can build it yourself
17:03:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's msm8953_64 based on 4.4 kernel for that tag
17:04:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Msm8996 shares the same source
17:06:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Seplx](https://matrix.to/#/@seppppx:matrix.org): I'm sending you UM-07600 in pm
17:07:48 <strcat[m]> won't be up-to-date and how will you confirm that's legitimate and not modified?
17:08:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): it isn't
17:08:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> 86400 something is the latest
17:08:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Whatever number he said
17:09:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's some xiaomi device codenamed daisy that might have the one he's asking for
17:09:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway back to sleep
17:10:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also if you're looking for these
17:10:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> It means your current vendor is much older than these blobs anyway
17:11:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> They're also available on TheMuppets openly on oneplus 3 repos
17:18:00 <uchihaitachi[m]> Does the project recommends app store/s to use? e.g: F-Droid, Aurora Store, etc.
17:18:57 <inthewaves[m]> <Lia[m] "For some reason, when VPN is con"> cannot reproduce
17:19:33 <strcat[m]> uchihaitachi: no
17:22:03 <inthewaves[m]> > <@6wl2xin0rvp88sb6j4kr5m567i4i58zi:the-apothecary.club> For some reason, when VPN is connected to another profile with lockdown on, and switched to another one, the current profile can't connect when it has VPN too in lockdown
17:22:03 <inthewaves[m]>  * cannot reproduce, though it's with WireGuard and not something built-in the OS like IPSec
17:32:05 <Lia[m]> <inthewaves[m] "cannot reproduce"> Yeah, same here. Confirmed it was slow internet
17:33:32 <asdkajdhskjhgf98> hi, to build i need "python2-protobuf" but i don't find any installation instructions
17:34:08 <asdkajdhskjhgf98> is this not included in python2 ?
17:36:00 <Lia[m]> <inthewaves[m] "cannot reproduce"> Nice job fixing the vpn lockdown. Tested it recently in LAN, and the issue didn't persist
17:36:26 <Lia[m]> Used VPN(s): Proton, Calyx, Mullvad
17:36:49 <inthewaves[m]> <asdkajdhskjhgf98 "is this not included in python2 "> try `pip2 install --user protobuf`
17:39:03 <asdkajdhskjhgf98> uhm pip2 not found
17:41:56 <asdkajdhskjhgf98> ok i installed protobuf
17:42:09 <asdkajdhskjhgf98> but it still says not found when i run python2-protobuf
17:42:10 <asdkajdhskjhgf98> its normal?
18:07:31 <inthewaves[m]> it's normal, afaik protobuf is just a Python library/module, not a command
18:08:28 <inthewaves[m]> it's used in the android-prepare-vendor step and maybe compiling Vanadium
18:08:43 <inthewaves[m]>  * it's used in the android-prepare-vendor step and maybe compiling Vanadium, but Vanadium compilation is not needed
18:20:08 <propertype[m]> Fingerprint works with Signal but not with Bitwarden. Strange
18:29:59 <blacklight447[m]> <propertype[m] "Fingerprint works with Signal bu"> it works here
18:30:07 <blacklight447[m]> im still one android 10 though
18:37:47 <derpy> think it is dangerous to give the Google Translate app storage access (from Aurora Store)? Needed for the photo -> text functionality :(
19:17:58 <aragorndr[m]> Use it in a separate profile
19:24:46 <strcat[m]> biometrics issues in the beta have been addressed for the next release
19:28:16 <deetot> Does anyone actually use biometrics through
19:29:53 <strcat[m]> yes I'm sure a lot of people do
19:30:10 <strcat[m]> and with face unlock it lets you configure it to only use it for the keystore / app authentication
19:30:18 <strcat[m]> not secondary unlock method
19:30:31 <strcat[m]> unlock methods are per-profile anyways
19:30:39 <deetot> Well. I've never seen anyone use it
19:31:04 <strcat[m]> you've never seen anyone use fingerprint or face unlock in general?
19:31:13 <deetot> Yeah
19:31:43 <deetot> That are not apple users
19:31:51 <deetot> Apple users don't count
19:31:55 <strcat[m]> at some point we want to add a similar toggle for disabling fingerprint secondary unlock while still having it for other uses
19:32:03 <strcat[m]> and we want to make that 2-factor secondary unlock feature
19:37:05 <deetot> Welcome back
19:59:41 <strcat[m]> nice, OVH fixed their useless broken server monitoring feature
20:00:08 <strcat[m]> still useless but at least they removed half of it and fixed the rest?
20:09:10 <derpy> aragorndr[m] then it'll only have access to photos in that other profile, right? So I'll have to use the camera in that other profile?
20:12:00 <JTL> strcat[m]: monitoring for network or hardware issues?
20:12:08 <JTL> (I'm vaguely aware of what you're talking about)
20:12:24 <strcat[m]> JTL: it's this really crappy web console
20:12:29 <JTL> oh right
20:12:31 <strcat[m]> I'm looking at their 2020 offerings, they updated it from the 2018 ones I'm mostly using now
20:12:39 <JTL> I've heard about that
20:12:42 <strcat[m]> previously VPS only had 100 Mbps max
20:12:42 <JTL> (the janky automated tools of theirs)
20:12:52 <strcat[m]> now they go up to 2 Gbps
20:13:04 <strcat[m]> JTL: it's really sketchy / broken / laggy
20:13:05 <strcat[m]> also at one point mine got stuck in french
20:16:19 <strcat[m]> JTL: https://paste.xinu.at/z1hr6M/ these are the 4 VPS options now
20:16:24 <strcat[m]> prices in CAD
20:16:48 <strcat[m]> there's a 5th Starter option too, they just don't list it with the main ones
20:17:15 <JTL> not bad specs on paper, curious how well the 2Gbps network works in practice
20:17:38 <strcat[m]> starter is 1 core / 2 GB memory / 20GB SSD / 100 Mbps
20:17:51 <strcat[m]> $5 / month
20:17:56 <deetot> Who's that with
20:17:58 <JTL> OVH
20:18:04 <strcat[m]> JTL: starter is comparable to the 2018 VPS SSD 1, which is most of the servers atm, but it was 50 cents cheaper
20:18:10 <strcat[m]> but they had no higher bandwidth options in 2018
20:18:11 <JTL> right
20:18:13 <deetot> Ahhh I've used them before
20:18:15 <strcat[m]> it just added memory, cores, disk space
20:18:41 <strcat[m]> JTL: starter is basically identical to VPS 2018 SSD 1 so I see no reason to upgrade other than theoretical benefits of the new infrastructure
20:18:50 <strcat[m]> it is kinda nice that the control panel is less buggy for the 2020 ones
20:19:05 <strcat[m]> I have one 2020 starter for connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org (not really used much atm beyond testing but whatever)
20:19:21 <strcat[m]> the rest are mostly the 2018 SSD 1
20:19:45 <strcat[m]> anyways going to upgrade releases.grapheneos.org substantially and sidegrade grapheneos.org
20:37:24 <strcat[m]> JTL: the storage + bandwidth of the "elite" one is nice but I really don't need all those cores...
20:37:43 <strcat[m]> kinda frustrating how little is configurable
20:38:01 <JTL> agreed
20:38:23 <strcat> you can upgrade them later
20:38:25 <strcat> can't downgrade
20:45:48 <adeus[m]> So Apple is going to get the security benefit of MTE potentially years before we might see it available to GrapheneOS/Android end users ? I heard one cybersec leader describe the benefit bluntly as ‚Äúthe end of RCE‚Äù ... seems like a pretty big deal even if an exaggeration
20:46:44 <strcat[m]> that's a serious exaggeration
20:46:50 <adeus[m]> I don‚Äôt know what it is am pissed though we not going to see it soon. Will be interesting to measure the market for 0Days on iPhone 12 which presumably will have the A14/MTE integration
20:47:00 <strcat[m]> a weak probabilistic form of memory safety is not the "end" of RCE
20:47:50 <strcat[m]> it has 4-bit tags
20:47:56 <adeus[m]> Ok ... so it‚Äôs not full blown game changer that will leave non-MTE enabled CPUs in dust ?
20:48:04 <strcat[m]> i.e. there are 16 possible values for tags
20:48:12 <cn3m[m]> yeah the chance of most memory exploits working is less 10% which gets tricky to chain, but not the end of RCE
20:48:29 <strcat[m]> so even without information leaks you have a 1/16 chance to succeed
20:48:56 <adeus[m]> What are the comparable odds without MTE?
20:49:06 <strcat[m]> and this is just for where MTE is used
20:49:11 <strcat[m]> which on a mainstream OS would primarily be the heap
20:49:18 <strcat[m]> adeus: it's not that simple
20:49:24 <strcat[m]> you can also just bypass mitigations
20:49:58 <strcat[m]> it provides 15/16 chance of detecting many forms of heap corruption basically
20:50:24 <strcat[m]> (slightly less than that in reality)
20:51:02 <cn3m[m]> <adeus[m] "Ok ... so it‚Äôs not full blown ga"> Kostya serebryany (from Google) put it as more powerful than everything else combined. Game changer, but definitely not perfect. You still have a few bugs that work, you can go for logic bugs too. It does make exploit chains much harder, but especially if you get say the browser all the secrets you need might be in there anyway. Which isn't bad odds
20:51:34 <cn3m[m]> It is cool, and definitely the coolest thing on the hardware side
20:51:42 <cn3m[m]> It is not a magic bullet
20:51:58 <adeus[m]> Well seems like a big deal
20:52:05 <adeus[m]> Sucks we going be years behind Apple
20:52:26 <strcat[m]> it's a hardware feature
20:52:56 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm SoCs also aren't the only ones available
20:53:15 <strcat[m]> we'll need to add support for it to hardened_malloc first anyway
20:53:25 <strcat[m]> but can't really do that without finding a way to test it
20:53:28 <strcat[m]> maybe there's an emulator with it
20:53:31 <cn3m[m]> If Google made their own chips for example I am certain they would keep up with Apple very well
20:53:43 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "maybe there's an emulator with i"> yeah, it is just slow as hell
20:53:46 <adeus[m]> Any other security game changers that is actually on the horizon for mobile devices? Been waiting for QubesOS level gains in mobile for too long what to look forward to?
20:53:52 <cn3m[m]> like 35x slower
20:54:03 <cn3m[m]> <adeus[m] "Any other security game changers"> GrapheneOS is more secure than Qubes generally speaking
20:54:10 <cn3m[m]> iOS as well
20:54:45 <cn3m[m]> strong sandboxes definitely can be more powerful than a VM. There is nothing magical about VMs they are programs that can have flaws
20:54:59 <strcat[m]> MTE has to come with a new SoC generation since it's a hardware feature
20:55:21 <strcat[m]> Android has memory tagging support itself already
20:55:23 <cn3m[m]> post exploitation with verified boot and the hardware and software mitigations on ARM chips and mobile OSes are superior
20:55:35 <blacklight447[m]> <cn3m[m] "strong sandboxes definitely can "> a sandbox or a vm says nothing about the security of the isolation
20:55:41 <strcat[m]> we haven't added it to hardened_malloc due to lack of available hardware and lack of our own resources
20:56:09 <strcat[m]> so we can't really focus on something like that without value on current hardware
20:56:14 <blacklight447[m]> a just a virtual version of hardware withand os on top
20:56:14 <cn3m[m]> <blacklight447[m] "a sandbox or a vm says nothing a"> exactly, an exploit for Chrome costs more than a chain from Firefox on Linux to popping almost all VMs
20:56:32 <blacklight447[m]> a sandbox is just a limition applied by the os on an application or servers
20:56:38 <blacklight447[m]> docker is a sandbox for example
20:56:43 <cn3m[m]> since Chrome is robustly isolated and hardened(and underratedly fuzzed)
20:56:59 <blacklight447[m]> sure its not a security focused one, but still a sandbox
20:58:09 <blacklight447[m]> the security is relies completely on the implementation and context in which it takes place
20:59:03 <strcat[m]> so for example
20:59:05 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A78
20:59:10 <strcat[m]> is still ARMv8.2
21:01:32 <strcat[m]> and Snapdragon is currently based on ARM's Cortex cores with minor modifications
21:01:46 <strcat[m]> ARM themselves hasn't moved on from ARMv8.2 for their standard core designs yet
21:01:51 <strcat[m]> that's what's holding it up
21:02:22 <strcat[m]> it's a short term problem
21:02:43 <cn3m[m]> Google or someone could come along and base of ARMv8.5(MTE) and match Apple
21:03:30 <blacklight447[m]> i wonder if google would ever consider making their own silicon like apple does
21:03:32 <cn3m[m]> the other thing imo to consider. GrapheneOS has a lot more flexibility in some cases than iOS. Which ever platform limits your PC usage(which is less secure than iOS or GrapheneOS) the better
21:03:52 <cn3m[m]> For me GrapheneOS on my phone and iPadOS on my tablet has been a powerful sweet spot between minimizing the sensitive things I do on a PC. Huge security uplift
21:04:26 <cn3m[m]> If I had an iPhone maybe there would be more things I would have to do on my PC. Even though I might have less attack surface(by only using iOS) and I would have things like MTE(for the few years that is an advantage)
21:04:32 <blacklight447[m]> <cn3m[m] "For me GrapheneOS on my phone an"> again: graphene with desktop mode
21:04:39 <cn3m[m]> security is about the weakest link
21:04:42 <blacklight447[m]> i will never give up that dream
21:04:51 <cn3m[m]> your phone not having MTE is not the weakest link
21:05:21 <cn3m[m]> Your phone not being able to do something that replaces your PC could be a weakest link
21:10:58 <strcat[m]> no one has stepped up to help implement memory tagging for hardened_malloc
21:11:10 <strcat[m]> maybe it will take a year to find someone who cares to help anyway
21:12:38 <strcat[m]> also BTW
21:12:50 <strcat[m]> memory tagging is probably only used for small heap allocations, not large ones
21:12:51 <strcat[m]> at least in a mainstream OS
21:12:57 <strcat[m]> because memory tagging faults in the pages
21:13:17 <strcat[m]> at least with how it's currently designed for linux afaik
21:16:17 <strcat> it's not in upstream linux at all yet
21:16:20 <strcat> android has it downstream
21:26:44 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "no one has stepped up to help im"> i thought it was a hardware feature?
21:27:11 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: it is
21:27:29 <strcat> it has to have support for it implemented in the kernel, libc (ideally) and memory allocators though
21:27:35 <strcat> linux kernel does not have it upstream yet
21:27:44 <blacklight447[m]> ah, i see
21:28:10 <strcat> google has an experimental kernel with downstream support
21:28:15 <strcat> and experimental support in bionic and scudo
21:29:58 <blacklight447[m]> but lets say google implements it
21:30:13 <blacklight447[m]> what would be left for us to port
21:34:03 <strcat> implementing it with hardened_malloc
21:34:14 <strcat> it's not trivial, it requires work and testing
21:34:39 <strcat> atm it's difficult because it requires an experimental kernel branch from google, only android / bionic really supports it experimentally
21:36:26 <cn3m[m]> the other challenge(not a deal breaker) is that Android isn't entirely 64bit so it only applies to 64bit code
21:36:41 <cn3m[m]>  * the other challenge(not a deal breaker) is that Android as an ecosystem isn't entirely 64bit so it only applies to 64bit code
21:37:12 <strcat> cn3m[m]: 32-bit apps are already being purged though
21:37:34 <cn3m[m]> yeah Chrome is switched on beta iirc
21:37:44 <strcat> cn3m[m]: it worked fine as 64-bit ages before that
21:37:51 <strcat> it just *preferred* 32-bit processes
21:38:07 <strcat> cn3m[m]: Chrome as shipped supported 64-bit just fine
21:38:26 <strcat> for many, many years
21:38:38 <cn3m[m]> right, thankfully they are getting on board for actually using it
21:38:38 <strcat> they had it prefer 32-bit processes to save memory, that's it
21:38:52 <strcat> it's a property in the manifest basically
21:38:58 <strcat> for dual arch builds
21:39:07 <strcat> and it has to be dual arch to support 32-bit apps as WebView
21:40:47 <cn3m[m]> They will probably have all 64bit on Android before MTE I'd guess
21:45:18 <KE0VVT> How long will the 3a be supported?
21:45:41 <KE0VVT> No direct answer in <https://grapheneos.org/faq#when-devices>.
21:46:01 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#legacy-devices
21:46:16 <strcat> you're reading the wrong section
21:55:22 <KE0VVT_> strcat: That still doesn‚Äôt give me a definite answer.
21:55:40 <strcat> it does: when the device is no longer supported by the vendor, GrapheneOS won't support it
21:55:45 <strcat> that's the definite answer
21:56:18 <strcat> there is not a specific date when support will be dropped, there is a 3 year minimum guarantee from launch
22:11:07 <strcat> alright replacing releases.grapheneos.org with a 2020 OVH Elite VPS
22:11:16 <strcat> 2 Gbit unlimited bandwidth sounds pretty good
22:11:38 <blacklight447[m]> nice!
22:12:10 <strcat> unsure if I want to just switch to a starter for the website or the tier up from that
22:12:30 <strcat> at one point I accidentally upgraded the website from 2018 VPS 1 -> 2018 VPS 2
22:12:38 <strcat> which is useless, it just adds RAM and disk space it doesn't need
22:12:41 <strcat> lol...
22:12:58 <strcat> the UI was broken and I didn't feel like recreating it to save $5/month
22:14:20 <blacklight447[m]> Depends, is it feasable momey wise
22:14:37 <strcat[m]> it's not really a substantial cost
22:15:05 <strcat[m]> other costs are far higher
22:15:13 <strcat[m]> so I decided why not get the best VPS they offer for the releases server
22:15:15 <strcat[m]> shrug
22:15:29 <strcat[m]> ofc just got minimum storage / memory for it
22:15:38 <strcat[m]> but it can be upgraded if for some strange reason it needs more
22:15:56 <strcat[m]> every couple years they come out with a new line of VPS, and you can upgrade within a line
22:16:05 <strcat[m]> but not between them since it's a whole different system
22:16:18 <strcat[m]> so I have to recreate the 2018 VPS variants rather than being able to upgrade them
22:20:00 <dazinism> uchihaitachi: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
22:20:25 <strcat> the "fun" part of migrating over releases now
22:20:29 <strcat> I hate certbot
22:21:33 <strcat> 'The product is being delivered'
22:21:47 <strcat> not really sure why a VPS needs to be delivered but sure
23:34:47 <strcat[m]> ok fancy new releases server is available
23:34:55 <strcat[m]> I haven't taken down the old releases server so that there's no downtime from DNS propagation
