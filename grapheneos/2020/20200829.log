08:26:17 <kocka> ahhoi
08:27:08 <i3c[m]> Having Grapheneos relying on AOSP codebase is still a dependency, because we know that Google is leading the design of AOSP even though itâ€™s 100% open source, even though they use the Linux kernel. But that remains true for some other open source projects. Even if you take Linux, for decades its development has been sponsored by some big techs (Intel, IBM, Red Hatâ€¦), and there is little doubt that there could have been
08:27:08 <i3c[m]> some influence on the development roadmap and features at some point. Just look at the Linux Foundation sponsorsâ€¦
08:28:31 <JTL> i3c[m]: A somewhat valid point. At the end of the day, there's no abololute "zero trust" in code and dependencies. For what it's worth the main developer for this project has discovered security issues in AOSP before and reported them to Google under a bug-bounty program (someone else correct me if I'm wrong)
08:49:18 <kocka> I've just flashed grapheneos to a brand new pixel 3a \o/ . is esim supported by grapheneos?
08:58:47 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <kocka "I've just flashed grapheneos to "> Nope
08:58:58 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Iirc, it is dependent on Play services
09:18:16 <kocka> thanks d64qoc8432li8p9o
09:19:38 <kocka> my 5x just died a couple of weeks ago, copperheados was running on it (about the last release by thestinger). missing the scrambled numbers on the pin pad :)
09:37:41 <cn3m[m]> kocka: congrats on the massive upgrade
09:43:46 <theultron[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "Iirc, it is dependent on Play se"> WTF. A future where only eSIM is supported on new phones is with G-Services :(
09:50:00 <cn3m[m]> if phones ditch traditional sims there will have to be AOSP support for it
09:50:03 <cn3m[m]> don't worry about it
10:04:01 <Autopsy[m]> <kocka "my 5x just died a couple of week"> There's scrambled pin on GrapheneOS.
10:30:11 <theultron[m]> <svenskuser[m] "Is there a solution to simulate "> MicroG. CalyxOS is what you need,.
10:33:54 <cn3m[m]> <svenskuser[m] "Is there a solution to simulate "> do note that microG sends notification data without e2ee through Google's server
10:39:57 <cn3m[m]> <svenskuser[m] "Mm i dont like that, I might as "> GrapheneOS is open to adding a fallback, but it would be opt in per app and it would just simulate Google Play Services being offline
10:39:58 <cn3m[m]> iirc
10:43:21 <Autopsy[m]> Not e2ee, but still https right?
10:44:35 <cn3m[m]> svenskuser: no it is not in development, but anyone could add if it they desire there is a GitHub issue for it

12:14:05 <trismous[m]> <cn3m[m] "trismous: it is not that difficu"> My issue is that I'm kinda confused on where to start. With all the guides on the web I just feel overwhelmed.
12:15:32 <cn3m[m]> trismous: well first read the GrapheneOS build guide and the documentation related to that
12:15:54 <cn3m[m]> it goes into project details
12:16:23 <cn3m[m]> if you want to learn Kotlin
12:16:35 <cn3m[m]> start in the Playground
12:46:41 <Rene68> Is there any RSS-feed for Graphene news/releases?
12:47:29 <cn3m[m]> <Rene68 "Is there any RSS-feed for Graphe"> yes one sec

I'm using Linux so I used TFTC's video. The problem is like all other videos he's using different commands and skipping the verify signature step. I did end up working for me, but I would rather know what I'm doing from the install guide. I could get most of
13:42:11 <bson989[m]> my family to switch to GOS, but if I'm having trouble they won't even try. I think if they can tweak the install guide so that an old lady could figure it out they would have a bigger following.

14:48:11 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> Thank you Autopsy it didn't have a yellow triangle on it on Windows 10 build 10586. I tried right clicking in device manager and uninstaling then removed the cable and plugged it in again and the same error message unfortunately. It says "The device has stopped responding or has been disconnected." In build 14393 it doesn't even show in device manager.
14:49:44 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> I didn't check before I used ADB to put Graphene OS on it that with usual Android 10 it would connect using these cables.
15:42:34 <aeonsolution[m]> @d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org if you want to help test the Pixel 3a. this is step 0 https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
15:44:43 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> ^^ oh I see
15:44:43 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Thanks, I'll go read it, I'll DM you later
15:47:38 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <aeonsolution[m] "@d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.or"> DM'ed
15:49:12 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Or maybe I'll tell it here instead.
15:49:12 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> I don't have the required specs and I can't upgrade at the moment. Such a shame, but maybe I'd reach out once I had a proper workstation for this
15:49:27 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Sorry for the disappointment.
15:50:41 <aeonsolution[m]> you can make swap to make up for the lack of ram
15:51:05 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Well... Even 4GB + 12GB swap would do?
15:51:54 <aeonsolution[m]> how much space do you have
15:52:56 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Hmmmm..
15:52:56 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> I can wipe up to 160 GB of space right now
15:53:59 <aeonsolution[m]> you would be cutting it close but i think that would work
15:55:54 <aeonsolution[m]> if you need your computer for other tasks and such, it might not work though because your computer is going to be using a lot of resources
15:56:06 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Ok, will try to reinstall ubuntu or arch
15:56:20 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <aeonsolution[m] "if you need your computer for ot"> Not really, I do most tasks at phone
15:56:38 <aeonsolution[m]> then you are golden
15:57:23 <aeonsolution[m]> the building will take upwards of 4+ hours just to give you an idea of how long the process might take
15:58:12 <aeonsolution[m]> but ill be happy to walk you through it, my computer is resource constrained too so i can relate
15:58:31 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Cool, will give this a shot
15:58:31 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> I'll DM you when I had reinstalled Arch/Ubuntu
15:58:31 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Is Arch GUI installer recommended?
15:59:23 <aeonsolution[m]> i dont have experience using arch gui installers so i cant really offer an opinion there
16:00:06 <aeonsolution[m]> arch is nice because it has a bunch of tools you can download and dont have to fuss with android rules to get your computer to recognize your device
16:00:55 <marlow11[m]> arch has a GUI installer?
16:01:22 <aeonsolution[m]> ubuntu doesnt have those tools so you have to make customizations to the settings but installing it is way faster than arch
16:01:40 <aeonsolution[m]> so pros and cons
16:03:20 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> i see
16:05:49 <aeonsolution[m]> in my experience, whatever path you prefer is the best one to use because its going to keep you motivated
16:06:18 <aeonsolution[m]> dont do something that youre not interested in
16:09:18 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Thanks for the advise
16:12:44 <Blurrr> Newb here. That is, COMPLETE N00B here. Got tired of Google following me. Spent the last year weaning off Android by using iPod for everything. Tired of postage-stamp size screen. Pulled old Pixel XL2 out. Found GrapheneOS .... ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT!!! Thank you to all involved.
16:13:18 <Blurrr> And haven't used IRC in 15 years. Feels good to be back.
16:15:26 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <Blurrr "And haven't used IRC in 15 years"> Congratulations!
16:16:13 <Blurrr> Thanks :P
16:19:33 <Autopsy[m]> When it is plugged in, do you get the normal pop-up that asks how you'd like to use the device over USB?

16:21:10 <Autopsy[m]> If it doesn't pop up, plug the phone in and do it manually by typing USB preferences into the settings search menu, then selecting file transfer.
17:21:33 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> Thank you so much AutopsyðŸ’ª. Yes it wasn't popping up and when I clicked through to this settings page and set it to File Transfer it works fine on the Windows 10 build 10586.
17:22:26 <Autopsy[m]> Fantastic
18:28:47 <Autopsy[m]> <marlow11[m] "arch has a GUI installer?"> Bit late, but look for Arco Linux if Arch is a bit scary
18:32:56 <lev[m]> there are automated installers for the uninitiated
18:33:05 <lev[m]> e.g. zen installer
18:33:55 <lev[m]> though even then it's probably useful to read some of the installation page on the arch wiki
18:35:24 <lev[m]> if it goes awry however, don't expect help from the arch community rofl, they are like the human incarnation of "rtfm"
18:50:29 <ohbeejay[m]> Hi all - I have a question about receiving text messages on graphene os. I made the switch, but I'm not getting messages from android users. I see their messages on my old android phone.
18:53:26 <nickcalyx[m]> With what program
18:53:52 <nickcalyx[m]> Is it WhatsApp or signal or something
18:55:08 <ohbeejay[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "With what program"> On graphene I am using the default app. On the old android phone I was using messages, but then removed updates and changed the default messaging app on that phone to textra, and changed the default app, but am now seeing android user messages there.
18:55:49 <ohbeejay[m]> > <@nickcalyx:matrix.org> With what program
18:55:49 <ohbeejay[m]>  * On graphene I am using the default app. On the old android phone I was using messages, but then removed updates and changed the default messaging app on that phone to textra, and changed the default app, but am still seeing android user messages there.
18:56:53 <aeonsolution[m]> your provider needs to support your phone so you can receive sms messages
18:57:16 <aeonsolution[m]> usually putting the sim card in the phone with GrapheneOS does the trick for T-mobile and Verizon
18:58:04 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are using an app like Signal, Whatapps, etc that support end-to-end encryption messaging
18:58:06 <ohbeejay[m]> I can send texts from the graphene phone, and receive them from iphone users. But when I send a message from the graphene phone to an android user, the reply will show up on my old android phone
18:58:13 <aeonsolution[m]> having Wifi is enough for it to work
18:58:53 <aeonsolution[m]> if your old phone is getting SMS it is because your new phone doesnt have SMS
18:59:31 <ohbeejay[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "having Wifi is enough for it to "> Both are connected to wifi. If i put the old android phone on airplane mode, I won't receive the android user's reply until I put it off airplane mode. It will not show up on graphene
18:59:46 <Autopsy[m]> What is your Preferred network type set up as, ohbeejay?
18:59:57 <nickcalyx[m]> Didyou move the sim
19:00:33 <Autopsy[m]> Oh, sorry. I see your problem. Messages is a Google service, right?
19:00:48 <Autopsy[m]> Disable the number in Google?
19:00:54 <ohbeejay[m]> Hey autopsy - yes I made the "migration" to messages
19:01:07 <ohbeejay[m]>  * Hey autopsy - yes I made the "migration" to messages back in the day
19:01:35 <ohbeejay[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Didyou move the sim"> Yes it's in the graphene phone
19:02:06 <ohbeejay[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Disable the number in Google?"> Not sure what you mean.
19:02:06 <aeonsolution[m]> sign out of your messaging app in your old phone and figure out the settings in the new phone
19:03:01 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are using signal or whatsapp it should be pushing your messages to both phones
19:03:10 <aeonsolution[m]> so something in the settings is wrong
19:03:12 <ohbeejay[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "if you are using signal or whats"> I'm not using either
19:03:40 <aeonsolution[m]> then its something with your messaging app
19:04:15 <ohbeejay[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "then its something with your mes"> on graphene or the old android phone?
19:04:31 <aeonsolution[m]> on both
19:04:56 <Autopsy[m]> You've used Messages, which is a Google service. Android users will also probably be using Messages, and as Google have started to implement the iMessage type thing (can't remember what they call it off the top of my head), the messages are going through to your Google account.
19:05:33 <aeonsolution[m]> ^
19:05:39 <Autopsy[m]> RCS
19:06:06 <Autopsy[m]> The messages you are receiving, can you confirm if they are SMS or RCS?
19:06:11 <ohbeejay[m]> <Autopsy[m] "You've used Messages, which is a"> That was my thought - so then I switched default messaging apps to textra but I'm seeing it there now instead.
19:07:04 <ohbeejay[m]> <Autopsy[m] "The messages you are receiving, "> I'm guessing these are RCS messages - not sure how to confirm tho
19:07:21 <dazinism> Yeah I imagine its RCS
19:07:27 <dazinism> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services
19:07:49 <ohbeejay[m]> So is there an RCS compatible app I can use on graphene?
19:08:15 <ohbeejay[m]>  * So is there an RCS compatible app I can use on graphene? Maybe that will solve it on my new phone.
19:10:06 <Autopsy[m]> Textra also uses RCS, apparently
19:10:36 <Autopsy[m]> * Lied.
19:11:40 <dazinism> Imaging if, on your old phone, you goto settings > apps > Messages > storage and clear storage it'll stop getting the messages. That would also clear all data you already have stored in the app though.
19:12:41 <ohbeejay[m]> <dazinism "Imaging if, on your old phone, y"> Yeah I did that for both messaging and textra. Still getting it on textra.
19:14:13 <dazinism> Possibly the AOSP Messaging app does RCS?
19:14:22 <dazinism> Or the Phone app?
19:15:04 <dazinism> Think someone with GrapheneOS or CalyxOS reporting they unexpectedly got a video call soon after installing.
19:15:06 <Autopsy[m]> If you're signed into your Google account, can you check on messages.google.com to see if the messages are being received there, too?
19:16:04 <dazinism> Not sure if CalyxOS uses the same as GrapheneOS for these? cdesai ?
19:17:06 <cdesai> we have a bunch of extras (mainly from AOSP master and LineageOS) in the app, but not RCS I think
19:17:20 <cdesai> I had it here on stock for a bit but then it went away so I never got around to properly testing it on AOSP
19:18:50 <bson989[m]> <ohbeejay[m] "I can send texts from the graphe"> I'm still having the same problem.
19:19:37 <ohbeejay[m]> I've got to run but hope we can find a solution! I'll leave this window up to check later.
19:20:06 <dazinism> Maybe try clearing storage in the phone app on the old phone?
19:20:10 <Autopsy[m]> Submit a bug on GitHub?
19:20:22 <Autopsy[m]> Just so it is in a centralised place
20:33:38 <aeonsolution[m]> if its an issue with the stock messaging app, that's an upstream issue; using a dedicated messaging app is the best way to go ohbeejay
