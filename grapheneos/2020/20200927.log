00:46:44 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Betas running nice on 3aXL
00:52:13 <faxing[m]> Is the beta for the 3aXL on Android 11? Or still on Android 10?
00:58:43 <Lckdyspl7[m]> 11
00:58:55 <faxing[m]> oh wow nice
00:59:00 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Last 2 have been 11 faxing
00:59:06 <faxing[m]> I thought so but I wasn't positive
00:59:41 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Biometric bug from last release is patched and things are running very smoothly
00:59:42 <faxing[m]> I wanted to go to the beta then reactivate the stable channel just to get 11 but I'm worried that it would mess something up and since this is my main device I can't have it not working haha
01:00:06 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Nah, that's exactly what I did.
01:00:32 <Lckdyspl7[m]> But I did upgrade to the failed beta so had to factory reset when upgrading to the rollback
01:01:14 <Lckdyspl7[m]> But you won't face that issue updating at the moment. Seems very stable and I'd assume it'll be released in stable channel soon anyway
01:01:52 <strcat[m]> the latest release is out in the stable channel now
01:02:33 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Ah well there u go!
01:03:15 <Lckdyspl7[m]> If I've already updated via beta it won't change if I switch channel right ?
01:03:36 <Lckdyspl7[m]> strcat?
01:04:19 <louipcm> nice
01:11:49 <faxing[m]> Huh weird. I clicked the 'Check for updates' button like five minutes ago and nothin
01:12:15 <faxing[m]> Hopefully I'll get it soon or when I wake up tomorrow or whatever
01:14:58 <faxing[m]> ah nevermind I had to disable NetGuard then it came in
01:15:52 <LinusSexTips[m]> Graphene has network perm toggle in the perm manager
01:15:55 <LinusSexTips[m]> You don't need to use netguard
01:23:39 <Lckdyspl7[m]> 🤔🤔🤔 hmm
01:23:41 <LinusSexTips[m]> Check the changelog, it explains why there
01:25:36 <strcat[m]> Lìckídysplï7: changing the channel just changes where it looks for updates
01:25:40 <strcat[m]> doesn't change what you already have
01:25:56 <bson989[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "damn newest graphene update brok"> Mine seems to be working fine
01:26:15 <Lckdyspl7[m]> temporarily use stock WebView until the next release of Chromium is available with public support for Android 11 to provide the WebView via Vanadium again
01:26:17 <bson989[m]> Pixel 3
01:26:20 <bson989[m]> Yep
01:27:04 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Microg dont work on gos
01:28:22 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Don't know why you'd wanna use it anyway, the stock camera app has improved and opencam with api2 is pretty feature rich
01:29:11 <bson989[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "do you have any libraries or mic"> Gcam services provider
01:29:26 <bson989[m]> No microg
01:30:42 <cn3m> <analtenderloin[4 "no portrait mode, no nightsight,"> fake bokeh
01:31:05 <nickcalyx[m]> What about panorama. Slowmo, time lapse, night mode
01:31:51 <nickcalyx[m]> I know 😒
01:32:26 <nickcalyx[m]> But I like those gimmicks
01:33:52 <cn3m> google camera is gimmicky
01:34:13 <cn3m> good for the average person, but every photographer I know hates it
01:34:17 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah but people like that shit.. and stuff like snapchat filters
01:35:03 <cn3m> Google Camera is the Snapchat of camera apps
01:35:24 <cn3m> Google Camera is fine, Open Camera is more powerful and natural
01:35:59 <bson989[m]> <Lckdyspl7[m] "Don't know why you'd wanna use i"> I never got open camera to take good pictures especially indoors. Maybe I didn't set it up right. Nitesight just works so well
01:44:00 <bson989[m]> Yes especially when you have kids and you don't have time to play around with settings
02:19:09 <faxing[m]> I installed the new version of Graphene and NetGuard is gone
02:19:26 <faxing[m]> also that photo is really revealing about the quality of gcam and opencamera
02:19:27 <faxing[m]> wow
02:19:42 <bson989[m]> Yeah I have been playing around with open camera for the last half hour and I can't get any good consistent low light shots
02:19:59 <bson989[m]> <faxing[m] "I installed the new version of G"> Same here
02:20:37 <lev[m]> night sight seems unbeatable in the dark, but I've found opencamera to take better pictures under a variety of light conditions
02:20:40 <faxing[m]> I mean supposedly using Graphene you don't need NetGuard but it makes me feel better to block everything including system services and only whitelist what I need to
02:20:44 <lev[m]> though I suppose thats pretty subjective
02:21:21 <faxing[m]> Yeah back when I had a Googled Android phone and used  GCam some of the shots that GCam produced were genuinely unbelievable at night time.
02:21:32 <faxing[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "system apps bypass vpn"> What do you mean?
02:27:18 <lev[m]> I find portrait mode to be very goofy imo, like look at what it did to your headphone cable
02:27:32 <lev[m]> it can sometimes take good photos, but you have to be careful with it
02:27:54 * lev[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200715_001429.jpg (954KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LcetTIkSMnmKhGLTlOpjWWLY/IMG_20200715_001429.jpg >
02:28:07 * lev[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200715_131206.jpg (2536KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/lNOdtevosGuEDkeHiTHAmWwh/IMG_20200715_131206.jpg >
02:28:25 <lev[m]> so similar "still life" shots, one in lower light, one in afternoon light
02:28:44 <lev[m]> you still get good depth of field even without the AI based blurring, in the latter
02:29:02 <lev[m]> I am also amused by the text sharpening in the first picture lol, like the time stamp in VLC just pops right out
02:29:33 <lev[m]> (these are both opencamera, in case that wasn't clear)
02:30:34 <lev[m]> yeah, honestly I just have both, for different use cases
02:30:58 <lev[m]> portait mode is a nice effect, and I also do find slomo and panorama, etc., pretty fun
02:33:03 <lev[m]> it's very customizable, though I am not too fussed by the defaults
02:33:12 <lev[m]> though the "max screen brightness" thing, I had to turn off
02:34:46 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: a VPN-based firewall is a 'system' firewall because the system routes all traffic through it and uses the kernel firewall to block leaks
02:35:22 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: How?
02:35:26 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: VPN apps on Android are using a VPN service feature with very strong OS support including support for blocking leaks
02:35:30 <strcat[m]> RippedJack: how what?
02:35:49 <bson989[m]> <lev[m] "night sight seems unbeatable in "> Yes, definitely feature rich.  I'm curious to see how well the macro mode works considering we don't have a macro lens
02:35:57 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: You mean routing tables?
02:36:18 <strcat[m]> I mean what I said above
02:36:31 <strcat[m]> when you enable an always-on VPN there is the option to block leaks
02:36:39 <strcat[m]> which uses the kernel firewall to block leaks
02:36:53 <strcat[m]> so if the VPN is not available or dies for some reason it blocks any potential leaks
02:36:59 <strcat[m]> it does that by default for the built-in ones
02:37:03 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: Yes it use the routing tables no iptables
02:37:33 <RippedJack[m]> * strcat: Yes it use the routing tables no iptables tables
02:37:39 <strcat[m]> iptables is part of how it routes the traffic and blocks leaks
02:37:56 <strcat[m]> it's an implementation detail anyway
02:38:01 <strcat[m]> you can look at what it does in netd
02:38:17 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: haha no....
02:38:40 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure what you're trying to claim, it's how it's implemented
02:39:01 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: Check your iptables
02:39:33 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: no
02:39:45 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: there is OS VPN service support
02:39:47 <strcat[m]> read about it
02:40:03 <strcat[m]> there is the option to set an always-on VPN and block leaks with the extra toggle
02:40:57 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: yeah not kernel support only routing seem leaky
02:41:14 <strcat[m]> it's not leaky
02:41:21 <strcat[m]> and it is implemented via the kernel
02:41:36 <strcat[m]> please don't spread misinformation
02:42:03 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: Yes! Using routing table like all vpns
02:42:24 <RippedJack[m]> Not iptables
02:42:51 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: that is not a quote of something I have said
02:43:11 <strcat[m]> no
02:43:18 <strcat[m]> those are not my words.
02:44:23 <strcat[m]> I know when something is not my writing style
02:45:40 <strcat[m]> I'm just saying I didn't say it
02:45:43 <strcat[m]> not that it's misinformation
02:47:14 <strcat[m]> the permission is implemented via BPF (as with other firewall features, iptables is not used for everything) and the regular permission check system for higher level things
02:47:26 <strcat[m]> before it used the network groups
02:47:38 <strcat[m]> socket groups, similar to the old grsecurity socket gid feature
02:49:23 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: it does, like any other permission, if apps expose an API to other apps permitting something to be done
02:49:30 <strcat[m]> they need to gate it with appropriate permission checks
02:49:46 <strcat[m]> of course, not all apps do that, especially since it's a low-level permission upstream, not a user-facing one they are expected to care more about
02:50:22 <strcat[m]> the core OS has checks for it on APIs offering by DownloadManager etc
02:50:40 <strcat[m]> within a profile, apps can mutually consent to communication
02:50:50 <strcat[m]> an app can expose an API that's explicitly exported for other apps to use
02:51:27 <strcat[m]> and they are responsible for deciding which apps are allowed to use it (based on permissions - including defining their own and/or app signatures typically)
02:51:47 <strcat[m]> there are shorthand ways of doing permission checks and app signature checks
02:52:17 <RippedJack[m]> Some apps like NetGuard use VpnService API of Android to block traffic at Layer 3 (TUN interface). The app can "notify when an application accesses the internet". Per app capturing and tracking (1, 2) is possible using VPN API as Android makes use of UIDs and SOcket_MARKs (1, 2) to control traffic in network Routing Policy (RPDB), just before leaving the device.
02:52:20 <strcat[m]> the INTERNET permission used to put the app into the gids for the socket whitelist feature
02:52:32 <strcat[m]> now it uses BPF instead
02:53:10 <strcat[m]> RippedJack: not sure what the relevance of that quote is supposed to be
02:53:57 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: as I said, DownloadManager already has a permission check
02:54:04 <strcat[m]> there are not issues involving this in the core OS
02:54:19 <strcat[m]> it has permission checks on the APIs upstream
02:54:23 <strcat[m]> AOSP implements this properly
02:54:30 <strcat[m]> apps developed outside AOSP are the issue
02:55:00 <strcat[m]> for example web browsers expose an API for other apps to open URLs
02:55:07 <strcat[m]> they don't generally check for the INTERNET permission
02:55:11 <strcat[m]> one of many examples
02:55:32 <strcat[m]> so an app could exfiltrate data by making GET requests via the browser and putting the data in the query string
02:55:54 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't be stealthy but it'd work
02:57:41 <strcat[m]> the same thing could happen with other permissions, if you trust an app with a permission or data you don't just trust that app with it but also that the app properly secures itself
02:57:43 <strcat[m]> to protect that
02:57:57 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: Google Camera depends on Play services, which GrapheneOS does not have
02:58:27 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: Google Camera also requires a special SELinux domain based on the combination of the app id + signature to grant it capabilities not available to a normal app
02:58:51 <strcat[m]> it used to implement everything in software using hardware ZSL support to capture multiple frames
02:58:55 <strcat[m]> but that is slow
02:59:24 <strcat[m]> so it requires special privileges to use the Qualcomm DSP and Pixel Visual Core / Pixel Neural Core directly
02:59:36 <strcat[m]> other apps can use them via high-level APIs provided by the OS designed to be safe
02:59:43 <strcat[m]> Google Camera expects full, low-level access to them
03:00:06 <strcat[m]> we do not currently remove this SELinux domain but we plan to remove it - I doubt Google Camera will continue working without Play services at all anyway
03:00:14 <strcat[m]> it already requires faking certain APIs being present
03:00:17 <strcat[m]> that is not going to keep working
03:01:02 <strcat[m]> your app faking the presence of Play services will also stop working
03:01:05 <strcat[m]> regardless of what we do
03:01:20 <strcat[m]> and if you modify Google Camera it won't have the signature for the special SELinux domain
03:02:12 <strcat[m]> we have all the OS-level features provided by the Visual Core (Neural Core on newer Pixels)
03:02:20 <strcat[m]> including HDR+ for apps that take pictures in a compatible way
03:02:32 <strcat[m]> anything exposed via a proper OS API will be present
03:03:28 <strcat[m]> what we don't want is exposing a large amount of attack surface to an app outside of our control which other apps are not allowed to use because it's dangerous
03:03:58 <strcat[m]> Google Camera is treated as a trusted component of the stock OS
03:04:03 <strcat[m]> highly privileged in a sense
03:04:09 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: What about blobs?
03:04:17 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
03:04:34 <strcat[m]> the issue with Google Camera is we don't have it included in the OS with our signing key
03:04:43 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: Are blobs sandboxed?
03:04:49 <strcat[m]> again
03:04:52 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
03:05:12 <strcat[m]> Google Camera still runs in something resembling the regular app sandbox
03:05:19 <strcat[m]> but it has those special privileges granted
03:05:24 <RippedJack[m]> BLOBS!!
03:05:31 <strcat[m]> beyond what the normal sandbox grants
03:05:47 <strcat[m]> it's matched by app id + signature so it can't be faked
03:06:18 <RippedJack[m]> Modem has direct acess to memory there no point
03:06:25 <strcat[m]> RippedJack: what?
03:06:37 <strcat[m]> the various radios are isolated
03:06:50 <strcat[m]> not sure why you are jumping to a totally different topic
03:06:53 <RippedJack[m]> * Modem has direct access to memory there no point
03:07:24 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular radios have 2 layers of isolation
03:07:26 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: It already compromised
03:08:00 <strcat[m]> they do not have access to memory that isn't made accessible to them via the IOMMUs
03:08:15 <strcat[m]> older devices didn't contain Wi-Fi (Broadcom Wi-Fi)
03:08:31 <strcat[m]> they did contain the cellular radio - we've never supported a device where the cellular radio has full access to memory
03:08:36 <strcat[m]> we did used to support devices where Wi-Fi did
03:09:03 <strcat[m]> the 5X was the 1st device with contained Wi-Fi
03:09:51 <strcat[m]> RippedJack: I don't really understand the sudden shift in topic
03:09:53 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: OK big chad
03:10:01 <strcat[m]> seems you are here to troll
03:10:39 <RippedJack[m]> No.......
03:10:43 <strcat[m]> (also generally Bluetooth has been implemented alongside Wi-Fi and shares similar properties)
03:11:31 <strcat[m]> it's also possible we could have configured the radio to be isolated on devices before the 5X and we experimented with it on one device
03:12:03 <strcat[m]> but it's very difficult to test that and get it working properly when you aren't the Wi-Fi SoC vendor like Broadcom
03:12:52 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: convince the developers to make it work without it and test it, otherwise you're just relying on incomplete workarounds that are likely to stop working over and over as more is needed
03:13:14 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: and then you aren't avoiding Google services since in the majority of cases, APIs are in Play services because they are Google services
03:13:42 <strcat[m]> there are only a few things provided by Play that are not Google services and they are no longer incentivized to include more due to APEX / mainline modules
03:14:04 <strcat[m]> now they can just declare an AOSP component to be a mainline module and require that vendors licensing Play have it updated via the Play Store
03:14:23 <cn3m> <analtenderloin[4 "i was told that in the coming up"> google camera works on many devices without that domain
03:14:33 <strcat[m]> cn3m: not with full capabilities though
03:14:52 <strcat[m]> and without zero-shutter-lag
03:15:41 <strcat[m]> they have kept most of the core functionality working without the hardware support but it's inferior without it
03:16:21 <strcat[m]> if you just use a compatible camera app you get HDR+ on GrapheneOS just like the stock OS without Google Camera
03:16:27 <strcat[m]> image quality matches if done properly
03:16:37 <Wonderfall[m]> Just upgraded to latest stable release (Android 11) on my Pixel 3a. Been playing with it, and it seems sensors are broken for me (Sky Map and "Lift to check" gesture don't work). Didn't touch any setting related to that as far as I remember. Is someone else impacted?
03:16:43 <strcat[m]> it's a lot less flexible and doesn't have APIs for all the fancy features
03:16:50 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: I don't see how that's the case at all
03:17:07 <strcat[m]> seems to be getting a lot better, we have stuff like Seedvault now and more nice apps than ever, we didn't before
03:17:17 <strcat[m]> Signal used to not be available
03:18:06 <strcat[m]> thanks to GSIs AOSP is more broadly used without Play services
03:19:18 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: it's not new that many apps depend on Play services, I don't think there's any more movement towards it
03:19:34 <strcat[m]> if you want an app to work without it you need the developers to want that and test it
03:19:45 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: netflix?
03:19:56 <RippedJack[m]> How will i cope?
03:20:11 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: you could do that, good luck though
03:20:28 <strcat[m]> may require extensive rewrites and they may have server-side dependencies on Google services
03:20:32 <strcat[m]> so you'd just need to implement them anyway
03:20:52 <strcat[m]> for example a lot of games use Google-based login so one way or the other if you want to make that work you need it
03:20:59 <strcat[m]> they use Google's game API platform
03:21:03 <strcat[m]> Google hosted cloud storage, etc.
03:21:15 <strcat[m]> so you can't avoid using Google services if that's what they use
03:21:35 <strcat[m]> on Android, Google implements APIs for their proprietary services via Play services
03:21:40 <strcat[m]> that's what Play services is
03:21:50 <RippedJack[m]> strcat: google is becoming more like apple
03:21:54 <strcat[m]> client APIs for Google cloud services is the reason Play services exists and is 95% of it
03:23:08 <strcat[m]> apple push notifications are not E2EE
03:23:40 <strcat[m]> some people like to misuse that term to mean transport encryption end to end... or comparable implementations
03:23:47 <strcat[m]> anyway, they aren't
03:24:46 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: I mean you can do that if you really want
03:24:57 <strcat[m]> you can encrypt what you send to a key in the app
03:25:10 <strcat[m]> but the service itself is not end-to-end encrypted
03:25:23 <strcat[m]> and the metadata is never going to be end-to-end encrypted
03:25:26 <strcat[m]> you could send data that is
03:25:42 <strcat[m]> but apple knows the app, time it was sent, size of what you sent, priority, etc.
03:26:00 <strcat[m]> don't really know what you mean
03:26:30 <strcat[m]> just because you send a push notification doesn't mean you have to put unencrypted data into it
03:26:52 <strcat[m]> the way signal uses FCM/APNS is that they just notify the app that there is data
03:27:19 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: yes, they can see the contents of them - and you can encrypt the content you send if you wish, just like an SMS message
03:27:49 <strcat[m]> that's not what I said
03:29:03 <strcat[m]> that isn't what I said above
03:29:48 <strcat[m]> the same thing applies to FCM, if you want you can encrypt the data you put into an FCM payload, but that is something you are explicitly doing
03:30:02 <strcat[m]> and anyway, it is not generally how it is done
03:30:17 <strcat[m]> usually you just use APNS/FCM to let the app know there is something to fetch
03:30:46 <strcat[m]> actually putting data into it to avoid a connection to your server from the app is a micro-optimization and you can't design around that since not all push notifications are actually delivered
03:31:11 <strcat[m]> I think you're confusion the concept of low-level push notifications with high-level notifications from apps
03:31:13 <strcat[m]> different things
03:32:34 <strcat[m]> sending a push notification via APNS/FCM is unrelated to a high level user-facing notification other than apps often making one in response to the push
03:32:51 <strcat[m]> the most common way to use APNS/FCM is simply to notify the app that it should check the server
03:33:01 <strcat[m]> it wakes up the app and the app can connect to the server to see what is there
03:33:14 <strcat[m]> it is a way to wake up your app with a tiny data payload
03:33:21 <strcat[m]> you don't have to put any data in it
03:33:24 <strcat[m]> Signal doesn't
03:33:33 <strcat[m]> you can also choose to encrypt data you put into it
03:33:47 <strcat[m]> (but of course they have the metadata)
03:34:26 <strcat[m]> for example you certainly aren't going to be putting emails into push notifications, you are just going to be waking up the email app to make it check for new emails
03:35:02 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: the only reason to send data is to let the app know which server it should check
03:35:11 <strcat[m]> also some pushes are going to be lost, it is not a reliable way to send data to an app
03:35:18 <strcat[m]> it still has to check servers anyway
03:35:38 <strcat[m]> so for example you might push a notification to the email app telling it which account / server has new emails
03:35:47 <strcat[m]> the app connects to that server and fetches it
03:35:57 <strcat[m]> then if there is really new mail it shows a notification if configured to do that
03:36:11 <strcat[m]> if you really wanted
03:36:16 <strcat[m]> you could fit a small message into a push notification
03:36:38 <strcat[m]> but you have to check the server anyway - what if someone sent 10 messages, and you just got a push for the last 1, or a couple of them?
03:37:15 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really work well as the sole way of sending data to an app, both the Apple and Google documentation essentially recommends against that
03:38:08 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: when an app implements push manually on Android, all it means is they keep open a connection to the server, so it can *push* new data which inherently wakes up the app, and to do that themselves they need a battery optimization exception + a way to stay running like a foreground service
03:38:41 <strcat[m]> but that is how FCM and APNS are implemented themselves: keep open a connection, occasionally check to make sure it's still working (and throttle that based on the type of network, etc. with some dynamic adjustments to handle different networks)
03:38:50 <strcat[m]> an app doing that itself is not less efficient
03:38:58 <strcat[m]> 1 app doing that is the same efficiency as FCM doing it
03:39:03 <strcat[m]> if it is implemented properly
03:39:37 <strcat[m]> 5 apps doing it with a synchronized implementation? essentially the same situation, but they probably just do their own thing so yes it gets less efficient with multiple apps doing it themselves
03:39:52 <strcat[m]> plus app developers often don't do a good job
03:40:25 <strcat[m]> if you have multiple apps that always choose the same timer periods, the OS is going to synchronize it as long as they do that right
03:40:26 <lev[m]> yeah that was my (limited) understanding as well: it couldn't be both power efficient, and immediate
03:40:36 <lev[m]> particularly since most folks will have many apps they expect to notify them
03:40:39 <lev[m]> various chat clients, etc
03:40:49 <strcat[m]> lev: it can be both if they do it right
03:40:58 <strcat[m]> keep open a connection, push data from the server through it
03:41:19 <strcat[m]> client just needs to occasionally check that the connection works - that's a timer at a regular interval, adjusted based on the connection
03:41:25 <strcat[m]> and as long as they do the timer properly via a good OS API
03:41:35 <strcat[m]> the OS will sync the checks apps do together to a large extent
03:41:41 <strcat[m]> that's how the OS timer/alarm APIs work
03:41:55 <strcat[m]> of course, most apps aren't going to do a great job
03:42:06 <strcat[m]> but there is no reason they can't do a good job
03:42:21 <strcat[m]> even if their timers don't precisely line up, if they use the proper OS APIs, it lines them up via the leeway
03:42:26 <lev[m]> I haven't spent the time to set this up, but I was planning to add a bridge/bot to my work slack, so I could get some level of notifications through element
03:42:38 <lev[m]> element does take up a decent chunk of power though, when I leave notifications enabled
03:42:40 <strcat[m]> OS timers are imprecise and have leeway unless you very explicitly tell it you need an EXACT timer
03:42:46 <lev[m]> it was like ~10% last time I tried
03:42:49 <strcat[m]> lev: it's not implemented well
03:42:49 <strcat[m]> it polls
03:43:01 <strcat[m]> lev: it doesn't have a push implementation, it does polling, AFAIK
03:43:07 <strcat[m]> lev: that's not what I'm talking about
03:43:10 <lev[m]> ah, that makes sense then lol
03:43:18 <strcat[m]> I'm talking about apps that implement their own push by keeping open a connection, like Signal does
03:43:26 <strcat[m]> and WhatsApp also does it
03:43:30 <lev[m]> yeah signal seems to work great
03:43:39 <lev[m]> as does telegram?  though I use that less
03:43:47 <strcat[m]> lev: basically, when Signal is active - with or without Play Services, it keeps open a connection to the server and pushes data through it
03:44:03 <strcat[m]> lev: with Play services, when Signal is idle, it stops using that and instead uses FCM to wake the app when there is data to fetch
03:44:09 <aragorndr[m]> <cn3m "good for the average person, but"> Professional photographer here. I love the Gcam
03:44:15 <strcat[m]> lev: without Play services, it instead continues using the regular connection it uses
03:44:50 <strcat[m]> lev: and needs a battery optimization exception + foreground service to do the same thing FCM does itself (keeping open the connection, occasionally pinging to make sure it hasn't died)
03:45:03 <strcat[m]> the efficiency is just based on how well the occasional checks are tuned / throttled
03:45:12 <strcat[m]> Signal has a good implementation now, it's not great, it's not super optimized, but it's good
03:45:21 <strcat[m]> it would be possible for there to be a library for apps to reuse
03:46:05 <strcat[m]> lev: badly made apps would just do polling but they really don't have to do that, and it implies they are inefficient / unreliable when in the foreground anyway
03:46:24 <strcat[m]> lev: apps already need a proper implementation of push regardless of FCM usage for when they are being actively used
03:46:39 <strcat[m]> lev: FCM/APNS is just to wake your app in the background and tell it to connect + fetch data
03:47:21 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: AOSP sets the warning for API level to < 23, we raise it to < 28
03:47:30 <strcat[m]> so you get a warning for apps targeting an API lower than 28
03:47:43 <strcat[m]> AOSP apps aren't all ported to the most recent API level
03:47:55 <strcat[m]> DeskClock was updated to API 29 recently
03:48:10 <strcat[m]> if they're actively developed they probably target API 29 / 30
03:48:25 <strcat[m]> Messaging is still supported / developed but not very actively
03:49:01 <Aaron[m]2> anyone here in the graphene community experience the "bluetooth has stopped working" bug where the wifi stops working at the same time? I heard its a widespread pixel 3 issue with android 10+, almost ready to sell this phone because its almost unusable
03:49:20 <strcat[m]> Aaron: are you on the latest release?
03:49:40 <Aaron[m]2> I was yeah, jumped to the beta release to see if it would make any difference, no luck :/
03:49:59 <lev[m]> is it pixel 3 only?  I have a pixel 3xl that I use daily, and I've never had that happen to me
03:50:04 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: I don't think Messaging has a use for battery optimizations being disabled
03:50:21 <Aaron[m]2> I'm tempted to do a factory reset with google's ROM and then try sideloading graphene again, not sure if that would make much of a difference though if the bug is in google's firmware
03:50:29 <Aaron[m]2> Yeah mine's a pixel 3 XL
03:50:41 <lev[m]> bizarre, I use bt audio extensively too
03:50:56 <strcat[m]> Aaron: you should get logcat logs either from adb or the bug report capture tool in the OS
03:50:57 <strcat[m]> after it happens
03:51:00 <Aaron[m]2> granted I bought the phone exclusively to run graphene, i don't have much experience using google's stock OS
03:51:33 <Aaron[m]2> strcat: will do, hopefully it gives me a better idea of what's going on
03:51:34 <strcat[m]> possible one of the GrapheneOS hardening features is detecting a bug uncovered by a Bluetooth feature you're using
03:51:59 <strcat[m]> adeus: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy are the privacy improvements
03:52:08 <strcat[m]> there are also security improvements
03:52:16 <strcat[m]> https://security.googleblog.com/2020/06/system-hardening-in-android-11.html
03:52:24 <Aaron[m]2> I will say though to any graphene os dev's in this chat, graphene os otherwise has been spectacular, so big ups to you guys
03:52:39 <strcat[m]> adeus: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/features new API features for apps
03:53:07 <strcat[m]> there are one-time permissions and apps targeting API 30+ have permissions auto-revoked if they aren't used
03:53:15 <strcat[m]> you can grant a permission for a single use of an app
03:53:23 <strcat[m]> instead of indefinitely
03:54:13 <strcat[m]> Scoped Storage is actually enforced for API 30+ too
03:54:53 <strcat[m]> i.e. no more legacy permission for access to your home directory
03:55:01 <strcat[m]> for apps that target Android 11 and above
03:55:22 <strcat[m]> API 29 becomes mandatory for apps on the Play Store (both new apps and updates to existing apps) very soon
03:55:35 <strcat[m]> API 30 will be mandatory around this time next year, takes a bit over a year for it to be enforced
03:56:00 <strcat[m]> and we'll raise our warning to match the Play Store requirement as we did before (that's why we currently warn for < 28)
03:56:17 <strcat[m]> instead of having a much lower API level for the OS warning
03:56:19 <strcat[m]> like AOSP/stock
03:57:03 <Aaron[m]2> generating a bug report through dev tools atm, anyone know how to grab logs through adb debugging?
03:57:19 <aeonsolution[m]> <Aaron[m]2 "I will say though to any graphen"> It is great, a lot of work goes into the project thanks to strcat and all the other contributors. If you haven't already please consider donating what you can at https://grapheneos.org/donate.
03:57:40 <strcat[m]> Aaron: a bug report has the logs included in the zips
03:57:45 <strcat[m]>  * Aaron: a bug report has the logs included in the zip
03:58:14 <Aaron[m]2> ah so it saves the bug report as a local zip instead of just uploading it from a temp directory right?
03:58:19 <strcat[m]> Aaron: you can manually do `adb logcat` to show the logs and continue showing new logs (`adb logcat -d` to just dump current logs)
03:58:36 <strcat[m]> Aaron: the bug report capture tool expects you to use an email client to email the bug report somewhere iirc
03:58:52 <strcat[m]> Aaron: don't remember if it has a way to send it via other kinds of apps
03:59:08 <Aaron[m]2> ah okay, thanks for the help!
03:59:26 <strcat[m]> adeus: it doesn't really improve security in any way, it's just the same thing on an emulated SIM essentially
03:59:48 <strcat[m]> adeus: a SIM card is a secure element with SIM applets / data on it
04:00:41 <strcat[m]> an eSIM just gets rid of that physical secure element for the SIM so you don't need to actually put a SIM in the phone
04:01:08 <strcat[m]> if anything it would be less secure because you don't have a dedicated secure element for it anymore
04:01:45 <strcat[m]> it's a convenience feature, it will become the norm
04:02:44 <aeonsolution[m]> Does anyone know of a project that has "Mobile network data" working on AOSP for Sprint? Would really like to get that ported to GrapheneOS. Didn't have any luck on my end. Just was able to confirm that sms works on GrapheneOS currently for Sprint.
04:02:57 <strcat[m]> adeus: carriers like that they get to have their own secure element rather than trusting someone else to implement this for them, so it's a matter of carriers being convinced to use it
04:05:09 <strcat[m]> analtenderloin: sprint expects to be given a form of remote backdoor to configure your settings, etc.
04:05:33 <strcat[m]> they feel that if you have a device on their network they should be able to manage your device to an extent
04:05:34 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMA_Device_Management
04:07:43 <aeonsolution[m]> thats what im trying to figure out
04:08:21 <aeonsolution[m]> they allow out of network devices so i dont see why it wouldnt work
04:09:42 <Lckdyspl7[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "open camera has a really ugly UI"> U can change it
04:09:51 * Lckdyspl7[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200927-140815.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/tQCtJoIzHOEGUamPPtbCeQDs/Screenshot_20200927-140815.png >
04:10:42 <Lckdyspl7[m]> But still not great
04:10:50 <lev[m]> huh, I never knew that about sprint, how heinous
04:10:55 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Sorry I've been off chat for ages 😂
04:13:25 <Aaron[m]2> looking through logcat, looks like when the bluetooth tries to pair with my earbuds, it throws: vendor.qti.bluetooth⊙1_handler: Close: Killing daemon to recover as firmware download is stuck, right after it does a crash dump
04:14:16 <Aaron[m]2> also seeing stuff like: a2dp_vendor_ldac_decoder: A2DP_VendorLoadDecoderLdac: cannot open LDAC decoder library libldacBT_bco.so: dlopen failed: library "libldacBT_bco.so" not found
04:15:19 <Aaron[m]2> sounds like it's not loading the wifi+bt firmware properly, is there any way to specifically force update/reinstall just the firmware on these pixel phones?
04:16:29 <strcat[m]> Aaron: that's about a library, not firmware
04:16:38 <strcat[m]> Aaron: try using a different Bluetooth audio codec
04:16:41 <strcat[m]> also which device is this on?
04:17:08 <lev[m]> just to add another data point: I also use LDAC on my p3xl without issue
04:17:11 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bt/+/master/stack/a2dp/a2dp_vendor_ldac_decoder.cc
04:18:03 <strcat[m]> maybe we aren't including / building a library we should be
04:18:06 <marlow11[m]> Since the last update my camera app and gallery app crash constantly. Is this a known issue or should I file a bug report?
04:19:25 <strcat[m]> marlow11: which update
04:19:35 <strcat[m]> the most recent release pushed out today?
04:19:45 <strcat[m]> 2020.09.25.00
04:19:45 <Aaron[m]2> currently using the Pixel 3 XL, and yeah that's a library, but also looking through the logs it's trying to load firmware from /bt_firmware/image/crnv21.bin, fails (no such file/directory), then succeeds loading firmware from the /vendor/firmware folder
04:20:02 <strcat[m]> Aaron: that's normal afaik
04:20:03 <Aaron[m]2> idk how relevant that is but its the most noticable thing i found
04:20:27 <strcat[m]> Aaron: software often looks in multiple locations for stuff and is expected to fail to find it at some locations
04:20:32 <marlow11[m]> There was an OTA update that showed up on my pixel 2 about 5 hours ago. I reboot to install and then the crashes started happening.
04:21:58 <marlow11[m]> strcat: yes that must be the one
04:23:15 <marlow11[m]> It's only open camera and stock gallery as far as I can tell
04:24:23 <Aaron[m]2> looks like right before it restarts the bluetooth daemon it throws: bt_hci  : Ctlr H/w error event - code:0xf
04:25:06 <Aaron[m]2> i may just try resetting the whole phone back to stock when i have time, if not i may just need to look into getting a different pixel phone
04:25:24 <strcat[m]> marlow11: the gallery app is just a sample app demonstrating a gallery app and isn't really maintained anymore so that's not really a surprise
04:25:32 <strcat[m]> marlow11: we may need to update our workarounds for camera memory corruption bugs on the Pixel 2
04:25:39 <strcat[m]> I think on the Pixel 3 and 4 most of the issues have been resolved upstream
04:25:55 <strcat[m]> camera drivers are notoriously buggy
04:31:16 <aeonsolution[m]> Sprint is working now, eyyy
04:31:44 <aeonsolution[m]>  * Sprint data is working now, eyyy
04:31:51 <marlow11[m]> strcat: ahhh okay no worries. I've always just used the stock gallery app, simple gallery seems much better though. As for the camera app, would a bug report help? Like a log dump?
04:33:36 <aeonsolution[m]> everything was working minus data
04:34:00 <aeonsolution[m]> but you also need to get Sprint to activate everything on their end too, didnt need to install anything else
04:34:06 <aeonsolution[m]> idk if it has to do with the merger or not
04:35:02 <lev[m]> are they the only ones with coverage in your area?  or did you get grandfathered in with a killer deal or something?
04:35:34 <aeonsolution[m]> killer deals
04:35:52 <M6o66y[m]> Hi. Does Graphene Pixel 3 still have screenshot function after last update?
04:36:22 <lev[m]> that's fair, that's why I've held on to my provider too, I'm on a plan they stopped offering years ago lol
04:37:32 <aeonsolution[m]> gotta hustle
04:38:06 <lev[m]> no doubt, no doubt
04:38:48 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: so no SprintDM needed?
04:40:14 <aeonsolution[m]> <JTL "aeonsolution: so no SprintDM nee"> nope, just set mobile to whatever network you have available in your area
04:40:26 <aeonsolution[m]> for me, its 3G sadly
04:40:52 <aeonsolution[m]> > <@freenode_JTL:matrix.org> aeonsolution: so no SprintDM needed?
04:40:52 <aeonsolution[m]>  * nope, just set "Preferred network type" to whatever network you have available in your area
04:41:01 <JTL> nice
04:42:04 <aeonsolution[m]> but you still need to talk to the support people to make sure your phone is recognized by the network ie giving you IMEI and whatever other device info they need
04:42:30 <aeonsolution[m]> no OMA Device Manager needed thankfully
04:44:36 <aeonsolution[m]> JTL: this was an issue before the merger so for awhile i was just sticking to borrowing peoples Verizon accounts to test the phone
04:44:54 <aeonsolution[m]> but idk today felt like a good day to try it out lol
04:45:15 <JTL> haha
04:54:29 <jacrispy> is there any way to block ads within Vanadium?
04:55:00 <lev[m]> you can do your dns lookups against a provider that has ad filters, e.g. adguard
04:55:21 <lev[m]> so "no," but there are other solutions
04:55:27 <lev[m]> ah
04:55:30 <lev[m]> then just no
04:55:46 <jacrispy> i'd prefer not to give my data over to someone else
04:56:03 <jacrispy> and i'm not always on a network i can control
04:56:27 <lev[m]> tbf you are going to be making those requests to someone regardless
04:56:50 <jacrispy> i would normally install Firefox, but i've seen many say thats a terrible idea on Graphene
04:57:10 <RippedJack[m]> jacrispy: Why?
04:57:14 <lev[m]> cloudflare is also a popular option but yeah
04:58:07 <RippedJack[m]> lev: cloudflare is nsa house wife
04:58:27 <M6o66y[m]> <jacrispy "is there any way to block ads wi">  analtrmderloin's bromite suggestion is what you want.
04:58:33 <jacrispy> ripped: reasons they have sited were around it not be secure or something?  i dunno exactly
04:58:41 <lev[m]> RippedJack: you've said a lot of bold stuff today, but you're never specific about any of it
04:58:59 <lev[m]> also if the NSA has it out for your personally, I don't think avoiding cloudflare is going to solve your problems
04:59:47 <M6o66y[m]> <M6o66y[m] " analtrmderloin's bromite sugges"> https://www.bromite.org/fdroid
05:00:08 <jacrispy> thanks, i'll check that out
05:00:40 <lev[m]> yeah, and also probably live in the mountains heh
05:01:12 <lev[m]> preferably mountains that aren't in the US
05:02:57 <lev[m]> really you shouldn't interact with anyone who uses electronics either, live in a rural, obscure place, and live off of your own farming efforts
05:03:03 <lev[m]> barter with your crops
05:03:23 <M6o66y[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "keep in mind that while bromite "> Does dns adblocking help?
05:03:46 <lev[m]> help what?  it prevents you from loading ads
05:04:13 <RippedJack[m]> Snowden is a spy for the usa undercover to spy on russia
05:04:43 <RippedJack[m]> analtenderloin: You need more?
05:04:59 <lev[m]> do the russians let snoden see important state secrets or something?
05:05:08 <lev[m]> or is the object of his mission to find out what russian apartments are like
05:05:18 <M6o66y[m]> <lev[m] "help what?  it prevents you from"> I think I saw something in the Grapheme
05:05:36 <RippedJack[m]> analtenderloin: open your eyes chad nothing new usa had done it before
05:05:56 <M6o66y[m]> I just use bromite and newpipe if the ads get too insane.
05:06:21 <lev[m]> using dns-over-tls or dns-over-https is good, since it prevents your ISP from tracking the requests you make, but you are letting another entity know these things instead
05:06:44 <lev[m]> cloudflare at least claims to not keep records for long, iirc
05:07:17 <jacrispy> i don't see Bromite in f-droid, do i have to add some repository?
05:07:21 <M6o66y[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "adguard is also a russian compan"> ....
05:07:46 <M6o66y[m]> <jacrispy "i don't see Bromite in f-droid, "> That link has the repo to add to fdroid.
05:08:02 <lev[m]> russians aren't inherently evil people, and the same argument applies as re: the NSA
05:08:10 <RippedJack[m]> Use ublocker chads
05:08:24 <lev[m]> jack lol
05:08:28 <lev[m]> are you new?
05:08:46 <jacrispy> thanks, i can't read
05:08:57 <M6o66y[m]> <lev[m] "russians aren't inherently evil "> Sorry, I wasn't dissing on Russians, just lamenting how hard it is to to escape data tracking
05:09:19 <lev[m]> yeah that's very true, but that's the argument about carefully considering your threat model
05:09:21 <lev[m]> who are you trying to avoid, and why
05:09:52 <lev[m]> governments are going to have a much wider/deeper reach, and avoiding them takes much more stringent measures
05:09:56 <lev[m]> but for most people that isn't necessary
05:10:49 <M6o66y[m]> I hate having my limited life span sucked up with advertising.
05:11:09 <lev[m]> agreed, I have no interest in seeing ads
05:12:02 <RippedJack[m]> 6o66y: use ublock chad
05:12:22 <jacrispy> thanks guys, installing it now
05:13:25 <M6o66y[m]> <RippedJack[m] "6o66y: use ublock chad"> Ublock works on Vanadium?
05:13:30 <RippedJack[m]> analtenderloin: Wrong chat room chad
05:13:45 <lev[m]> ignore rippedjack, he's making poor attempts at humor (I hope)
05:15:14 <M6o66y[m]> I didn't send that message... Have you hacked me?
05:15:27 <lev[m]> 6o66y: https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking-apps
05:16:00 <M6o66y[m]> Wait, does that mean you sent me a message?
05:16:24 <M6o66y[m]> I am so confused.
05:16:37 <lev[m]> I just tagged you, and earlier someone quoted you
05:17:00 <M6o66y[m]> Oh man, quoting me
05:17:04 <M6o66y[m]> Terrifying.
05:17:40 <jacrispy> lev: does that include bromite?
05:19:12 <lev[m]> bromite is considered a good option (it's better at anti-fingerprinting, but less secure than vadanium), see: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
05:20:22 <jacrispy> oh right thanks, that is where i read not to use firefox
05:20:35 <jacrispy> must have missed the Bromite part though
05:27:06 <jalb> Do you know why Vanadium Webview dissapeared in this last update?, thanks!
05:28:34 <aeonsolution[m]> android 11 doesnt support chromium version 85 aka its broken, it will support version 86
05:28:49 <aeonsolution[m]>  * android 11 doesnt support chromium webview 85 aka its broken, it will support version 86
05:29:32 <jalb> Vanadium is in version 85
05:29:50 <jalb> It works well, I don't understand
05:29:58 <aeonsolution[m]> cool?
05:30:05 <jalb> :)
05:30:16 <jalb> Don't we need webview now?
05:30:18 <aeonsolution[m]> jalb: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/267
05:30:28 <jalb> aeonsolution[m], thanks, I'll read
05:31:20 <jalb> Meanwhile I see a normal webview update in Aurora Store, must I update?
05:31:57 <aeonsolution[m]> newer than the one GOS pushed?
05:32:29 <jacrispy> do you guys use the default adblock filter or a custom one?  any suggestions on one that block everything?
05:32:42 <jacrispy> seems the default bromite one just blocks some stuff
05:33:12 <aeonsolution[m]> jacrispy: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
05:33:45 <jalb> aeonsolution[m], yes
05:33:50 <aeonsolution[m]> tl;dr everyone has different goals, find something that suits your needs and understand the pros and cons to adding customizations
05:34:12 <jalb> xxxx.127, Gos is in ...101
05:34:48 <jalb> So?, is it safe to update?
05:34:52 <jalb> Thanks
05:34:56 <jacrispy> aeon: i read through that, it's not what i'm asking.  I'm asking if anyone has a suggestion for a different filter then the default on IN Bromite
05:35:15 <aeonsolution[m]> jalb: i guess look at the release notes and figure out if you want to update it
05:35:20 <jalb> ok
05:35:41 <aeonsolution[m]> jacrispy: you mentioned default or custom?
05:35:54 <aeonsolution[m]> err
05:36:13 <jacrispy> just wondering if there is a public one besides the default that is good
05:36:37 <jalb> Nothing in the release notes
05:36:53 <jalb> Thank you anyway
05:39:13 <jalb> I see in Aurora Store "GSF dependent", so I'll avoid until I'm sure
05:41:33 <mastercakex[m]> Android System Webview update suddenly appears in Aurora store after updating to Android R
05:42:29 <jalb> mastercakex[m], please read what I posted
05:43:08 <liquidpuddle[m]> Hi, I'm on Windows 10 trying to install GrapheneOS. I'm stuck at the 'fastboot flashing unlock' stage. It just says <waiting for device> and I don't get the prompt on my phone to unlock the bootloader. Using 'adb devices' shows that no devices are attached while my phone is in fastboot mode, but it shows up when my phone is turned on as normal. Searching leads to this:
05:43:08 <liquidpuddle[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/coc6hh/issue_unlocking_bootloader/ which doesn't seem to help me
05:43:21 <jalb> I think Chromium 86 will be here soon, so I think I won't update until I'm sure
05:44:15 <faxing[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "system level firewalls are miles"> Sorry for not seeing this until now - so you're saying that essentially the Graphene network toggling is enough?
05:45:28 <faxing[m]> > <@analtenderloin:matrix.org> system level firewalls are miles better
05:45:28 <faxing[m]>  * Sorry for not seeing this until now - so you're saying that essentially the Graphene network toggling is enough and NetGuard is worthless?
05:45:31 <jacrispy> looks like Bromite can read lots of formats re: adblock lists :)
05:45:41 <jacrispy> thanks for all your help guys, Bromite seems to rock
05:46:17 <jalb> I imagine that Webview in GOS is the normal version, not modiified. IN this case maybe it's better to update because it fixes some bugs
05:46:29 <lev[m]> faxing: https://grapheneos.org/faq#firewall
05:46:32 <jalb> What you'll do guys?
05:48:16 <liquidpuddle[m]> <liquidpuddle[m] "Hi, I'm on Windows 10 trying to "> Nevermind - I found this https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb and will try it out
05:49:34 <faxing[m]> <analtenderloin[4 "if you use graphenes permission "> So it's better than NetGuard? Thanks a ton I had no idea, I bet my battery will be better now as well now that NetGuard isn't running haha
05:49:48 <faxing[m]> <lev[m] "faxing: https://grapheneos.org/f"> Thanks! Reading it now
05:50:59 <faxing[m]> Can I safely disable Network access to OsuLogin, ProxyHandler, Seamless Update Client, and Android System WebView?
05:51:59 <jalb> Well: a conflicting package exists... when I try to update from Aurora Store
06:10:01 <Aaron[m]2> welp, what a shame. just flashed my pixel 3 xl back to the stock OS and the bluetooth and wifi are both broken :( looks like i'm buying a new one since it's out of warranty
06:10:12 <Aaron[m]2> *still broken
06:11:01 <RippedJack[m]> Aaron: IQ below 0?
06:11:07 <faxing[m]> Is two button nav not on Graphene 11?
06:11:14 <Aaron[m]2> huh?
06:12:23 <faxing[m]> I went into the navigation section once I upgraded to Android 11 on Graphene and I see 3 button nav and gesture nav, but no two button nav
06:12:40 <faxing[m]> and I couldn't find any information on it for the normal android 11 release
06:12:42 <bungeetaco[m]> Yeah I noticed that as well
06:12:47 <faxing[m]> so i though maybe it was a graphene thing
06:13:22 <faxing[m]> <bungeetaco[m] "Yeah I noticed that as well"> Oh so it's not just me - it's still active for me right now but I just have to remember not to switch for any reason lol
06:13:32 <faxing[m]> > <@bungeetaco:matrix.org> Yeah I noticed that as well
06:13:32 <faxing[m]>  * Oh so it's not just me - it's still active for me right now but I just have to remember not to switch for any reason or i don't think i can get it back lol
06:13:33 <bungeetaco[m]> I upgraded and I still have 2 button nav since I had it enabled already prior to upgrading, but the option isn't listed anymore it seems for me as well
06:14:20 * bungeetaco[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200927-021405.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZWhCporOqoHCziBlkAbBWUja/Screenshot_20200927-021405.png >
06:14:40 <faxing[m]> exact same for me
06:15:22 <faxing[m]> I'm worried that I'll lose it because I hate three button navigation and I hate gestures equally - the two button nav was the only one that I actually really liked
06:15:44 <bungeetaco[m]> Yeah same thing here lol
06:17:12 <Sheru[m]> Wasn't 2-button navigation removed upstream?
06:17:19 <Sheru[m]> (Just a question)
06:17:25 <bungeetaco[m]> I mean, it's still there since it still works if you had it enabled prior to upgrading, but I wonder why the option isn't listed anymore
06:17:56 <Sheru[m]> It's not within the "apps" preinstalled anymore
06:18:00 <faxing[m]> I hope it's not gone forever if you ever change it on accident
06:18:16 <faxing[m]> It's such a good navigation style
06:19:05 <bungeetaco[m]> ^
06:19:29 <bungeetaco[m]> Afaik isn't that just an xml toggle in the settings app?
06:19:42 <Sheru[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/336
06:20:23 <faxing[m]> Oh cool
06:20:24 <bungeetaco[m]> Oh, nice lol
06:20:26 <faxing[m]> so maybe its just an issue
06:20:37 <faxing[m]> i hope
06:20:46 <bungeetaco[m]> Will add a comment to that post, because I def do not want to use gesture based nav
06:21:15 <faxing[m]> me too
06:21:18 <faxing[m]> gotta login to my github
06:21:37 <bungeetaco[m]> Won't touch that setting for now 🥲
06:22:04 <abff_> Just looking for info on updating to android 11, I haven't yet installed graphene but I intend to in the next month or so, just need the time to invest. Should I fast track my plans and install graphene soon so I don't miss out on security updates?
06:22:11 <faxing[m]> same lol
06:23:22 <mastercakex[m]> This webview issue is something not right
06:23:39 <mastercakex[m]> First time ever my phone rebooted while on vanadium
06:23:41 <jalb> mastercakex[m], I can't update from Aurora Store, can you?
06:23:49 <jalb> A friend of mine did it
06:24:07 <jalb> It says: conflicted package exists
06:24:10 <faxing[m]> <abff_ "Just looking for info on updatin"> you won't really miss out on security updates, graphene is just more secure than stock android and miles better for privacy, rest assured whenever you do flash it the process is relatively simple and only took me about 20 minutes with minimal previous flashing experience other than flashing Lineage to an old phone.
06:24:22 <jalb> I don't know why
06:25:29 <abff_> faxing[m]: does that mean I can upgrade stock to 11 without creating future difficulties?
06:25:45 <faxing[m]> should be the case
06:25:48 <abff_> for some reason I thought graphene used parts of the stock os
06:25:51 <mastercakex[m]> Can't update webview. Different package is used for graphene
06:25:56 <faxing[m]> now that graphene is on 11 as of today
06:26:03 <faxing[m]> shouldn't be a problem coming from 11
06:26:09 <abff_> nice okay sweet
06:26:30 <abff_> faxing[m]: I do intend to compile it myself as well
06:26:36 <abff_> so it'll take me about a day
06:26:43 <abff_> because I'm sure I'll fuck it up
06:26:47 <jalb> mastercakex[m], yes!, that's the message I receive, so we can wait a bit for Chromium 86 and Vanadium webview
06:27:37 <jalb> And I hate the new screenshot option... not where it was before :(
06:27:51 <jalb> I can't make a screenshot of notifications now
06:29:46 <bungeetaco[m]> Right? It's not like I even need the smart home controls either
06:32:14 <bungeetaco[m]> To be fair you can still take screenshots using the power+volume up buttons, but still, having a dedicated screenshot button in the power menu was a lot more useful than the full screen fake "fill cat bowl" I have now lol
06:34:44 <jalb> bungeetaco[m], are you sure?, doesn't work here
06:35:59 <jalb> Nothing happens when I clicked on power+volume up buttons
06:36:08 <jalb> *click
06:38:40 <CrispyCashew> Hello everyone
06:39:06 <CrispyCashew> Is anyone running GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4 XL?
06:39:07 <faxing[m]> actually it doesn't work for me neither lol
06:39:47 <ransome> @jalp for me it's power and volume down on Pixel 3a and it works fine with the notifications drawer open (if it's what you were referring to)
06:40:36 <jalb> ransome, thanks!!
06:40:43 <jalb> Yes, it works
06:41:48 <bungeetaco[m]> Woops my bad, you're right ransome
06:41:58 <mastercakex[m]> <jalb "Nothing happens when I clicked o"> Power+volume does Mute Sounds action for me
06:42:25 <jalb> mastercakex[m], try what ransome wrote
06:42:34 <bungeetaco[m]> It's power+volume down sorry
06:42:56 <abff_> ^
06:43:20 <CrispyCashew> jalb Cool, did you find any glaring issues or pretty smooth sailing all round
06:43:20 <bungeetaco[m]> Still, I miss the dedicated screenshot button
06:43:34 <jalb> CrispyCashew, all ok until now
06:43:39 <jalb> bungeetaco[m], me too
06:43:40 <mastercakex[m]> Oh. Power+vol down works. Yet I need to hold it. New way is better
06:44:08 <CrispyCashew> jalb until now? Uh oh haha
06:44:14 <ransome> ;)
06:44:17 <mastercakex[m]> Swipe up + Screenshot is faster
06:44:21 <jalb> CrispyCashew, I updated it 1 hour ago! :D
06:44:21 <bungeetaco[m]> I noticed it's a lot faster on my 3XL, but I still miss the dedicated button
06:44:55 <jalb> mastercakex[m], not when you want to make a screenshot of the notificactions or the main screen
06:45:04 <CrispyCashew> How long is each device supported in terms of bug fixes/ secuirty updates?
06:45:11 <bungeetaco[m]> Also the fact the power menu takes the whole screen for nothing kinda irks me, but that's more of a design thing. P sure Google didn't focus on AOSP on that lol
06:45:38 <jalb> lol
06:46:20 <mastercakex[m]> New power menu sucks for non Google pay users like me
06:49:26 <faxing[m]> Oh okay so the screenshot thing is power + volume down and hold it for like two seconds
06:49:36 <faxing[m]> that seems not very intuitive but alright lol
06:49:54 <bungeetaco[m]> I have a few Kasa smart switches and Phillips Hue lights, but even those apps don't show up in the add menu, so it's really just taking half my screen and hiding everything behind whereas the previous power menu just slid on the side and had everything right there like the volume menu
06:50:54 <bungeetaco[m]> I especially liked having lockdown available on a whim, now you have to click all the way at the top and reach for it
06:53:31 <bungeetaco[m]> You can kind of remove the smart home control section by doing this here, but it doesn't bring back the old power menu, just makes it mostly blank https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/remove-smart-home-toggles-from-android-11s-power-menu-0315368/
06:54:38 <faxing[m]> I mean the choice is blank power menu or try to collect cats when you're bored as hell
06:54:50 <larncat[m]> yes.. the cats!
06:55:26 <faxing[m]> I mean I keep catching #636 so I don't think it actually works in the GrapheneOS version but still
06:55:41 <larncat[m]> agreed that the new menu is inelegant
06:56:52 <bungeetaco[m]> I want a smart toggle for my 30-foot smart steel door in there!
06:58:37 <dazinism> Are you in a bunker?
06:58:54 <larncat[m]> on my p3, fingerprint reader is more reliable turning on the device with Android 11. Much more like stock. Any one else noticing this?
06:59:11 <bungeetaco[m]> Yes, chilling with snowden
06:59:21 <bungeetaco[m]> * Yes, chilling with snowden larncat
07:00:05 <larncat[m]> bungeetaco that might make a more convenient lockdown ;)
07:01:19 <bungeetaco[m]> <larncat[m] "on my p3, fingerprint reader is "> Yeah, I noticed things are a lot more smoother atm
07:01:34 <bungeetaco[m]> * Yes, chilling with snowden dazinism
07:04:38 <faxing[m]> even stupid things like the keyboard coming up, going down, and typing all feel smoother
07:12:30 <larncat[m]> I'm pleased with the upgrade, and honestly thrilled with GOS.
07:14:20 <larncat[m]> Running since July. Camera stability has improved with this release. Also, since this month Wifi texting on Verizon seems fixed. Still no wifi calling.
07:14:41 <bungeetaco[m]> I'm surprised we even got Android 11 ported that fast to so many devices
07:15:09 <larncat[m]> @faxing yeah
07:16:04 <bungeetaco[m]> Big props to the devs working non-stop on maintaining and updating GOS
07:16:29 <larncat[m]> truly.
07:17:59 <larncat[m]> I wish I would've tried Daniel's OS on my Nexus 5X.. might've convinced me to try the Pixel. Alas, I got snookered by an LG
07:18:50 <larncat[m]> GOS + Pixel is very impressive
07:19:04 <Sheru[m]> Google and its abandoned AOSP apps
07:19:25 <Sheru[m]> <mastercakex[m] "Swipe up + Screenshot is faster "> Can't relate, I can't see it for some reason
07:19:41 <bungeetaco[m]> That's with the gesture nav mode
07:19:44 <larncat[m]> traffickpolize the LG? I keep it for high def car stereo
07:19:58 <bungeetaco[m]> * That's with the gesture nav mode I think Sheru
07:20:11 <Sheru[m]> <bungeetaco[m] "That's with the gesture nav mode"> Yeah no, not switching from that
07:20:23 <Sheru[m]> > <@bungeetaco:matrix.org> That's with the gesture nav mode I think Sheru
07:20:23 <Sheru[m]>  * Yeah no, not switching to that
07:20:25 <Sheru[m]> Horrible UX
07:20:36 <bungeetaco[m]> Same here, they butchered 2-button nav and my power menu 😭
07:20:37 <Sheru[m]> Swiping left or right is a mess
07:22:06 <larncat[m]> I notice Pie style nav buttons are no longer an option in system navigation. Interestingly they remained in a profile until I switched to gesture nav.
07:22:33 <bungeetaco[m]> Yep, they cut the option it seems
07:22:41 <Sheru[m]> Google imitating Apple in the wrong way lol
07:22:58 <bungeetaco[m]> If you switched to a different mode, p sure you can't switch back to 2-button nav rn
07:23:15 <bungeetaco[m]> There's an issue open on GitHub about it
07:23:40 <larncat[m]> Gesture nav solved an old Android gripe of wasted real estate. many inferior solutions have come along, but this one is the best so far imoi
07:23:46 <larncat[m]> *imo
07:24:22 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, until you swipe left that accidentally goes back instead of showing options every single time /s
07:24:31 <larncat[m]> I appreciate that they cleaned up the recents gesture. I can't understand why google wont try a no-gesture zone at the top like Lineage OS
07:25:00 <bungeetaco[m]> I've always preferred the 2-nav button gesture, as I can press the middle button to bring up the home screen, and pull it up to see recent apps, which is all it needs to do
07:25:09 <larncat[m]> some apps still have relevant gestures. splitting sensitivity on L/R is novel, but not helpful to me
07:25:46 <Sheru[m]> <larncat[m] "some apps still have relevant ge"> Well, if they didn't abandon AOSP apps and optimize it for their gesture lol
07:26:09 <larncat[m]> Sheru I haven't had much trouble after the muscle memory sets in.. and the gestures are all very fast
07:26:22 <larncat[m]> which helps with the occaisional fumble
07:27:31 <larncat[m]> Sheru true dat
07:28:12 <larncat[m]> it's abandoned/confounded a long time Android design interface
07:28:26 <larncat[m]> but.. it works well in my case
07:29:15 <larncat[m]> and.. I would appreciate the confidence of swiping in a gesture free zone when I'm trying to figure out if an app still has side bars
07:29:58 <larncat[m]> or reliably use an app that does. That is a good fix.. LOS has it and it works
07:29:58 <Sheru[m]> Sidebars conflict with gestures is a problem
07:30:18 <larncat[m]> yess
07:31:54 <larncat[m]> i *have learned how to use a steady touch in the side bar region to activate the menu.. FairEmail is a regular use case
07:32:20 <larncat[m]> and I keep sensitivity at minimum
07:37:06 <larncat[m]> it's a light touch that's briefly held without swiping that works well for accessing those bars..
07:41:55 <fabilola[m]> Hey there, i just updated to 11. I was using the google camera before with the gcam services provider, but it stopped functioning with the update. I remember reading somewhere that this was dependent on a feauture that might be taken out at some point. Has this happened or does it make sense to fiddle a bit w it till its working again? Thks
07:42:21 <Sheru[m]> Not yet
07:44:40 <fabilola[m]> Ok thanks will try to get it working again then
07:53:00 <mastercakex[m]> Gcam still works great. Latest stable
08:03:13 <bbqcore[m]> Android 11 in latest update?
08:06:44 <Lckdyspl7[m]> https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-cstark27/ latest version from here works unsure if its original or not 🤔
08:10:04 <Lckdyspl7[m]> If not can someone send me the latest apk link? 😊
08:11:36 <dazinism> Lìckídysplï7: safest way to ensure original is to first download the version via Aurora Store
08:12:19 <dazinism> Then can only update to a newer version signed with the same developers keys
08:12:45 <dazinism> Think apkmirror has correct apks
08:13:12 <dazinism> Theres an app store for apkmirror available via fdroid
08:13:21 <dazinism> I've not used it
08:17:22 <dazinism> Theres also stuff about how to verify apks here

10:35:47 <dreth[m]> oki i will enable and report back if it happens again, but the first time it happened i got a system UI is not responding message after it came back to normal

12:10:52 <cn3m> sad_plan: that should sum it up
12:12:20 <cn3m> it is safe to say color accents are disabled for security and privacy issues, but it is mostly an upstream issue
12:12:26 <dazinism> Wonderfall: at least you got proximity sensor, so you won't accidentally hang up calls with your cheak
12:12:37 <dazinism> Does screen rotation work?
12:12:54 <Wonderfall[m]> Nope, that's how I noticed the issue in the first place
12:13:12 <Wonderfall[m]> (that and "Lift to check" not working anymore)
12:13:31 <cn3m> the website, /u/DanielMicay(redditcommentsearch.com), and the project issues are a wealth of information
12:13:32 <Wonderfall[m]> Might be a 3a issue only, strange though.
12:13:39 <dazinism> Guess it would be useful if you could get a logcat (or maybe a bug report?) and attach to a github issue
12:14:07 <sad_plan[m]> <cn3m "it is safe to say color accents "> Awesome 👍
12:14:47 <Wonderfall[m]> When I'm finished working, I can do that. I was hoping someone else could open the issue, I don't have much time to investigate myself (that's why I use stable only). Thanks for your answers.
12:24:50 <Hugh[m]> <Wonderfall[m] "Might be a 3a issue only, strang"> My 3a has all sensor information on 09.25

12:39:40 <dazinism> fr4: currently chromium doesn't support building webview for Android 11. So have to use Googles prebuilt webview for 11
12:42:34 <dazinism> The build of webview shipped with Graphene is signed with Graphene keys, so can't update with the version on Play Store
12:44:12 <rainme[m]> i'd suggest to blacklist its update along with auditor's
12:44:38 <rainme[m]> thus , you don't get a random error if you plan to update more than 1 update at once
12:49:37 <Nikos[m]> Just saw this tweet from Daniel:
12:49:37 <Nikos[m]> F-Droid has issues blocking us from bundling it especially with the privileged extension. Even if the technical issues were addressed, we want GrapheneOS to be permissively licensed including the ability to make a locked down device. F-Droid's GPLv3 license is incompatible.
12:49:37 <Nikos[m]> I was wondering, what's the benefit of locking the phone any more after one had relocked their bootloader? Or am I missing something?
12:53:15 <dazinism> Think the next version of chromium, which will enable vanadium to again be used for webview is due for release sometime early(ish) October
12:53:37 <dazinism> This has been the same with every Android version update.
12:54:22 <dazinism> Since Graphene started using monochrome, then trichromiun
12:54:32 <dazinism> trichromium

12:55:38 <dazinism> Which uses the same code for chromium(vanadium) and webview. Rather than having basically the same code for both.
12:56:53 <dazinism> Having vanadium webview gives hardening benefits
12:59:01 <dazinism> SheruNikos : think thats more about licences and the ability to make a secure/hardened device which is fully locked so oem unlocking isn't  accessed to the user
12:59:24 <dazinism> Think GPL licenses have anti TiVo clause that doesn't allow this
13:00:07 <dazinism> *isn't accessible to user
13:01:23 <rainme[m]> kinda sucks for fdroid users
13:01:58 <anupritaisno1[m4> <rainme[m] "kinda sucks for fdroid users "> It is their issue
13:02:06 <anupritaisno1[m4> Fdroid is not a really secure store
13:02:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> Unlike the play store their only standard is to have a FLOSS app

14:27:59 <dazinism> F-droid has issues. (The move to using v2+ signing is a welcome but late and still ongoing improvement) But so does Play Store - (much more malware, moving to forcing devs to give them their signing keys).  Theres a reason GrapheneOS wants it own app store.

16:25:27 <Knull[m]> you're trying
16:25:44 <louipc> Resynth[m]: to you they are mindless, but to graphene/aosp maybe they have some other goal you may not be aware of
16:26:13 <louipc> Resynth[m]: there are always kinks to work out with new releases
16:26:16 <rainme[m]> <Resynth[m] "I am trying, but I don't like th"> which one ?
16:27:35 <nickcalyx[m]> <Resynth[m] "I am trying, but I don't like th"> it seems to me that your complaints ought to be directed at google, not here
16:28:06 <nickcalyx[m]> graphene didn't make the UI changes, google did
16:28:07 <louipc> so please file some bug reports where appropriate
16:28:17 <louipc> nickcalyx[m]: or aosp rather?
16:28:32 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah but google makes aosp
16:28:46 <louipc> oh i thought it was more collaborative
16:30:18 <Resynth[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "it seems to me that your complai"> Sure, although I refuse to create a Google account to do so
16:30:33 <nickcalyx[m]> that's on you
16:30:55 <Resynth[m]> Furthermore, this is a separate point: I would like it if GrapheneOS warned me that they are going to push a new semver major OS update onto my phone
16:31:13 <Resynth[m]> So I can review it prior to having to use it
16:31:21 <louipc> maybe submit that as an idea on bug tracker
16:32:03 <louipc> but realise grapheneos main goal is security, and keeping user fully up to speed with all security updates
16:32:42 <louipc> if it intentionally compromised that in any way, it would not quite be graphene any longer
16:33:24 <Resynth[m]> <louipc "but realise grapheneos main goal"> Yes I realise that, but usability is a very important aspect of a phone too
16:33:32 <rainme[m]> <Resynth[m] "Yes I realise that, but usabilit"> what music player you are using ?
16:33:36 <Resynth[m]> Phonograph
16:33:40 <louipc> maybe graphenos isnt your bag then
16:33:41 <Resynth[m]> And the system apps crash too
16:33:49 <Resynth[m]> It's a fucking disaster of an OS
16:33:56 <rainme[m]> hmm it works on my pixel though
16:33:58 <Resynth[m]> Maybe it isn't, I'll check for alternatives
16:34:22 <rainme[m]> did you try a factory reset and trying again ?
16:34:37 <Resynth[m]> Uch, well I was hoping to avoid losing everything
16:34:46 <louipc> but yea new releases have kinks they will gets smoothed out
16:34:57 <Resynth[m]>  * Uch, well I was hoping to avoid losing everything because of an unstable OS
16:35:16 <louipc> but thats understandable if you cant wait
16:35:26 <Resynth[m]> Wouldn't it be more appropriate to wait for Google to actually test these updates before they roll them out
16:35:35 <louipc> hey would also really help to have someone to debug the obvious problems
16:35:50 <louipc> Resynth[m]: good idea. please reach out to google/aosp
16:35:58 <Resynth[m]> Like system apps randomly crashing? I wouldn't know where to start
16:36:29 <jpds> I just installed phonograph on my pixel 3a + A11 and it works
16:37:37 <Quan7um> Maybe try another clean install. I'm on the most current version of GOS on my Pixel 3a, and I'm not having any problems with any application.
16:37:42 <louipc> Resynth[m]: start by finding the root cause. post your problems on issue tracker, post debug info hopefully someone can reproduce it and give more feedback
16:38:09 <louipc> hooting and hollerin alone wont get it fixed
16:38:12 <Resynth[m]> <del>I should not have to debug Google's updates for them when they are a billion-dollar company
16:38:14 <Resynth[m]> But sure I can try
16:38:33 <louipc> i guess you could use iphone
16:38:48 <jpds> Indeed ^--, this is open-source software
16:39:35 <louipc> Resynth[m]: can you find the grapheneos bug tracker ok?
16:40:03 <Resynth[m]> Uhh, not really
16:40:24 <Resynth[m]> <louipc "i guess you could use iphone"> To be honest I am really starting to consider buying a used iPhone and using that

16:47:29 <Sheru[m]> <Resynth[m] "img_1601222260084.png"> Upstream issues
16:49:22 <Sheru[m]> The UX on Android 11 left a sour taste, especially on them having only little improvements on privacy and security aspects
16:49:40 <Sheru[m]> (The upstream AOSP 11, that is)
16:50:43 <Sheru[m]> Also, swiping up/down on some position on switching users at lock screen doesn't work
16:51:28 <rainme[m]> well personally i like the changes
16:51:54 <Sheru[m]> It's kinda meh given their weak security upgrades
16:52:41 <Sheru[m]> Like it pales out compared to iOS 14
16:53:23 <Sheru[m]> Especially on file permission system
16:54:26 <Sheru[m]>  * It's kinda meh given their weak security upgrades (pretty much almost nonexistent upgrade, outside of Scudo changes, and slight permission system changes)
16:55:59 <Sheru[m]> Scoped storage is kinda useless if the app devs won't use it
16:56:17 <Sheru[m]> They can just leave their SDK to minimum, like Signal
16:57:35 <Sheru[m]> Like by November, they can go to SDK29, and opt to Legacy storage permission, quite useless until next year
16:58:25 <Sheru[m]> Maybe it would have been nice if they separated the read and write access
17:01:52 <brenneke[m]> What to do about conflicting package problem when updating Android System WebView?
17:02:11 <Sheru[m]> Broken until Chromium 86 stable
17:02:57 <brenneke[m]> Thanks.
17:03:15 <Sheru[m]>  * Broken until Chromium 86 stable (as in the Vanadium)
17:06:16 <aeonsolution[m]> Resynth: You are missing the point of GrapheneOS https://grapheneos.org/ and open source projects https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software. If you really would like something implemented or fixed you can join the developers https://github.com/GrapheneOS or donate resources to help the developers https://grapheneos.org/donate.
17:06:22 <Sheru[m]> The webvew (temporary) has different signature than the one in Google Play
17:07:10 <aeonsolution[m]> If you don't want the most hardened and secure mobile OS go back to stock Android for the meantime and do your own research on alternatives that don't focus on privacy and security.
17:07:17 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#replacing-grapheneos-with-the-stock-os
17:07:32 <aeonsolution[m]> https://flash.android.com/welcome
17:07:58 <Sheru[m]> Mostly the upstream has issues
17:08:45 <Sheru[m]> Ecosystem, UX, improvements on privacy and security
17:09:05 <Sheru[m]> Even GrapheneOS 11 had more useful feature upgrade/fix than Android 11
17:09:42 <Zenithium[m]> <Sheru[m] "Scoped storage is kinda useless "> It was supposed to be mandatory in 11 iirc but devs cried too much so they delayed it to 12 I think
17:10:34 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, I don't like the android app ecosystem on that aspect (offtopicL
17:10:39 <Sheru[m]>  * Yeah, I don't like the android app ecosystem on that aspect (offtopic)
17:13:00 <aeonsolution[m]> Thanks for jumping in Sheru. Once someone stops being interested in GrapheneOS for reasons other than privacy and security all you can do is offer alternatives. Doubling down is not going to change their mind.
17:13:03 <Sheru[m]> Mostly gave the usual one year gap on minimum SDK on apps in Play Store
17:15:56 <Sheru[m]> Just a reminder that Google is an adtech company, and there is limit on what they can do in privacy and security for antitrust reasons
17:16:16 <Sheru[m]> can't easily lockdown the OS without having issues
17:30:32 <rainme[m]> hmm i gotta try gcam again cause using stock camera is a tad odd for me
17:59:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> Can somebody with a pixel 4a pm me for a testing build?
18:01:43 * anupritaisno1[m4 uploaded an image: IMG_20200927_233124_734.jpg < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/kGSxxMTrJkNoOopLEwlJgjqS/IMG_20200927_233124_734.jpg >
18:02:00 <anupritaisno1[m4> Basically this chat
18:02:36 <Sheru[m]> give me a 4a and I'd do it in heartbeat
18:02:51 <Sheru[m]> Joking
18:03:40 <anupritaisno1[m4> Worst is people who pm me for testing
18:03:51 <anupritaisno1[m4> And then disappear for 2 days
18:04:46 <Sheru[m]> Oof, free early access until they hit bugs
18:06:45 <fr4[m]> <rainme[m] "thus , you don't get a random er"> I didn't even tried to update I was just asking myself why, dazinist reply was perfect thank you anyway!
18:07:11 <Sheru[m]> Once 86 stable is available, maybe somebody can test the Vanadium webview with some ported patches? I don't have extra phones to check if it breaks something
18:08:19 <Sheru[m]> (Yeah, I can't test it with beta for beta reasons, patches won't apply)
18:08:44 <Sheru[m]>  * (Yeah, I can't test it with Chromium beta for beta reasons, patches won't apply)
18:10:57 <Sheru[m]>  * Once 86 stable is available, maybe somebody can test the Vanadium webview with some ported patches? I don't have extra phones to check if it breaks something on webview, albeit it does not have webview-related patches
18:13:09 <inpharmaticist[m> Hello. Got an update last night and now fitotracker wont connect to GPS.
18:15:51 <inpharmaticist[m> doesn't look like my GPS settings changed so im not sure whats going on
18:17:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> [inpharmaticist](https://matrix.to/#/@inpharmaticist:matrix.org): install the GPS status app
18:18:40 <inpharmaticist[m> Fdroid or Aurora?
18:28:28 <inpharmaticist[m> Location works in OsmAnd~
18:38:36 <snowkeld[m]> newest update broke vpn and changed something to do with apn because no matter what I do the carrier drops be immediately upon connection. Was fine on previous version
18:41:38 <inpharmaticist[m> My VPN works
18:41:56 <jpds> snowkeld[m]: Which VPN are you using? WireGuard's working on my device
18:42:24 <blacklight447[m]> <snowkeld[m] "newest update broke vpn and chan"> Vpns work fine here
18:43:19 <snowkeld[m]> openvpn broke/uninstalled as a result ofthe update. I installed it again using adb since network does not work and it seems ok
18:43:32 <snowkeld[m]> but still being dropped by the carrier
18:46:47 <snowkeld[m]> <jpds "snowkeld: Which VPN are you usin"> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.blinkt.openvpn/
19:02:27 <oats`> Was pleasantly surprised to see android 11 delivered so swiftly to my phone, congrats and thank you so much to everyone who had a hand 👏
19:12:58 <renex> In Fennec there's the option that on exit all private data is cleared, does Vanadium have something similar?
19:13:06 <anupritaisno1[m4> Anyone with a 4a?
19:13:38 <anupritaisno1[m4> Pm me
20:10:27 <epharisto> Hi guys, is it possible to downgrade the last update? My camera doesn't work.
20:12:10 <louipc> dam lot of bugs popping up
20:13:55 <c4rp[m]> <louipc "dam lot of bugs popping up"> Well that's Android 11 for you :/
20:34:29 <blacklight447[m]> Its working flawlessly for me atm
20:34:31 <blacklight447[m]> <epharisto "Hi guys, is it possible to downg"> What device?
20:39:49 <strcat[m]> louipc: some of those issues are not bugs
20:39:53 <strcat[m]> but rather how things are supposed to work
20:40:22 <strcat[m]> apps that were wrongly targeting API 30+ with v1 signatures are broken and the OS disables them now that API 30 is actually supported
20:40:33 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): I've only seen 1 bug here today
20:40:40 <strcat[m]> v1 signatures were deprecated in 2016 for security reasons
20:40:50 <anupritaisno1[m4> The 2 button nav options are not selectable
20:40:50 <strcat[m]> F-Droid continued using them until recently and still has apps signed with them
20:41:09 <anupritaisno1[m4> All others are hardware issues
20:41:21 <anupritaisno1[m4> And I've already talked to almost everyone who had an issue today
20:41:32 <strcat[m]> and since upstream apps started targeting API 30+ they were shipping apps in a broken state for Android 11
20:41:41 <strcat[m]> that's not an issue with Android 11 or GrapheneOS, it's an issue with the official F-Droid repository
20:41:49 <strcat[m]> so yes, because they shipped apps in a broken and insecure way
20:41:59 <strcat[m]> some of them that are still in that state have to be disabled by the OS
20:42:00 <anupritaisno1[m4> There's one guy in OT with a Spotify bug I can't reproduce on my device
20:42:12 <strcat[m]> definitely not a bug - it's supposed to happen
20:42:36 <strcat[m]> since v1 signing isn't as secure, it is disallowed for API 30+, so apps targeting API 30+ (i.e. Android 11+) must not have v1 signatures
20:43:06 <strcat[m]> Android 10 didn't enforce that because it only supports API 29, so targeting API 30 wouldn't change anything there
20:43:12 <strcat[m]> that's how API levels work
20:43:33 <strcat[m]> if an app says it targets API 30+ it must be compatible with 30+ and v1 signatures are not - so those are broken app builds on F-Droid
20:43:41 <strcat[m]> they are fixing it, slowly
20:44:05 <strcat[m]> Android 11 previews/betas have been available for a while and a reminder that v2 signatures came out in 2016 in Android 7 as a security improvement
20:44:18 <strcat[m]> and tools have generated v1 since before ~2nd quarter 2016
20:45:15 <strcat[m]>  * and tools haven't generated v1 signatures since before ~2nd quarter 2016
20:45:16 <dazinism> Yeah a definite mess up, but its being slowly sorted
20:46:00 <strcat[m]> a very slow >4 year crash
20:46:28 <dazinism> Think half the problem was that attempts to do  reproducable builds with v2+ looked to be difficult
20:46:45 <strcat[m]> I don't think v2 signatures impact reproducible builds at all
20:46:52 <strcat[m]> they were just not using the official signing tools and never updated
20:47:02 <strcat[m]> the official signing tools are producible
20:47:06 <strcat[m]>  * the official signing tools are reproducible
20:47:10 <dazinism> Also some of the main folks presumed A11 dropping v1 want going to be hard
20:47:16 <dazinism> A hard drop
20:47:45 <strcat[m]> no way because it has to stop working at some point
20:47:49 <strcat[m]> they don't just break apps suddenly
20:48:25 <strcat[m]> they make breaking changes as part of API levels unless it's an OS security hole (and this is about app security)
20:48:54 <dazinism> I did try and prod  some of the devs in their irc/matrix/telegram room a couple of month back
20:48:57 <strcat[m]> if someone is having camera issues, they're going to need to provide details including the device they're on, which camera app they're using, how they triggered the problem and whether it stops happening after a reboot
20:49:09 <anupritaisno1[m4> 4-5 years is quite reasonable if you ask me
20:49:18 <strcat[m]> saying that the camera doesn't work doesn't help - I have 1 of each supported device, front and rear camera work fantastically on each of them - much better than in Android 10
20:49:21 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): also a log
20:49:21 <strcat[m]> no stability issues anymore
20:49:40 <strcat[m]> so if someone is having camera issues they need to provide details because here everything is rock solid unlike before
20:49:41 <bobfett> Getting android 11 seemed to solve most of my crash with OpenCamera on Pixel 3XL, I do not know what changed but thanks
20:50:07 <strcat[m]> bobfett: a LOT of upstream bug fixes for memory corruption bugs due to broader usage of ASan and also them now using Scudo which finds a subset of the issues hardened_malloc does
20:50:30 <strcat[m]> camera on each device should work better now, not worse
20:50:34 <strcat[m]> and we can potentially drop our workarounds
20:55:17 <strcat[m]> snowkeld: see above for why apps with v1 signatures targeting API 30+ (which is broken) got disabled
20:56:29 <strcat[m]> Zenithium: scoped storage was delayed as being enforced from 10 to 11, not 11 to 12
20:57:10 <snowkeld[m]> that's fine and all, but 11 is unusable as long as my network provider drops me immediately on connection. Verified same service and APN on previous version is still working, I am in the process of re-flashing old version and keeping it from updating.
20:58:02 <anupritaisno1[m4> [snowkeld](https://matrix.to/#/@snowkeld_:matrix.org): device and carrier name
20:58:08 <Zenithium[m]> Oh I thought it was still optional
20:58:31 <snowkeld[m]> pixal 3a xl
20:58:31 <snowkeld[m]> total wireless (verizon service)
20:59:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> Wtf are these new carriers
20:59:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> Probably missing the Verizon apks in product
21:00:00 <strcat[m]> Resynth: the 2 button gesture thing is not removed, it's just missing in our Settings app because we're missing an overlay, it might have to do with exec spawning
21:00:11 <Resynth[m]> Hmm
21:00:30 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): BTW why not use full gesture settings?
21:00:47 <Resynth[m]> Well that's a good thing for Google lol, I bet they would get huge backlash if they straight up removed shit like that
21:01:06 <Zenithium[m]> <Zenithium[m] "Oh I thought it was still option"> Apps that run on A11 but target A10 still don't have to use scoped storage, no?
21:03:41 <blacklight447[m]> <Resynth[m] "Well that's a good thing for Goo"> Lol, google barely cares about backlash
21:03:41 <blacklight447[m]> <Resynth[m] "Well that's a good thing for Goo"> Two button gestures were trash anyway imo
21:05:24 <strcat[m]> brenneke: we ship the WebView updates ourselves, app stores you have installed shouldn't be trying to update it to an apk with a different signature
21:05:54 <anupritaisno1[m4> BTW
21:06:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> If you do update that way on grapheneos be very careful
21:06:21 <strcat[m]> snowkeld: I doubt Android 11 is tied to your carrier issues but rather it's probably because we updated the APN database
21:06:34 <strcat[m]> snowkeld: you probably just need to configure it differently than what they submitted for their new APNs
21:06:36 <anupritaisno1[m4> You cannot uninstall updates to the trichrome library
21:06:58 <snowkeld[m]> <strcat[m] "snowkeld: I doubt Android 11 is "> I used the same device on same service to enter in the APN that is confirmed working manually and it does not work
21:07:02 <anupritaisno1[m4> And selinux hardening will crash it
21:07:18 <snowkeld[m]> the other device is running v10
21:07:37 <anupritaisno1[m4> You'll either have to reset or wait a while for an even newer webview in a system update to replace your bad upgrade
21:07:39 <strcat[m]> snowkeld: make a new APN instead of using the existing ones
21:07:52 <snowkeld[m]> <strcat[m] "snowkeld: make a new APN instead"> I did
21:08:22 <strcat[m]> so far we're aware of 1 confirmed issue: we need to bundle an overlay so that the configuration option for 2 button gestures shows up
21:09:09 <snowkeld[m]> I have two pixal 3a xl devices both with graphene
21:09:10 <snowkeld[m]> one updated and broke network.
21:09:10 <snowkeld[m]> I add a new APN to the one running v11 with the exact APN settings from v10
21:09:23 <strcat[m]> Sheru: Resynth: also unsure why you expect a ton of user-facing changes, there's COVID-19, there hasn't been the typical amount of development and features were scaled back or punted forward
21:09:34 <strcat[m]> there are substantial privacy and security improvements
21:09:39 <strcat[m]> upstream
21:09:54 <strcat[m]> and they fixed a lot of memory corruptions which improves stability too
21:10:07 <strcat[m]> there's some missing polish in GrapheneOS because we haven't configured / adjusted everything yet
21:10:33 <strcat[m]> problems that were reported by Beta testers were 100% fixed
21:10:34 <anupritaisno1[m4> Actually how is covid an excuse for software development?
21:10:37 <strcat[m]> we did weeks of beta testing
21:10:54 <anupritaisno1[m4> Pretty sure 90% of Google's programmers can be wfh
21:11:09 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: because they weren't set up to do remote work
21:11:22 <anupritaisno1[m4> Ah okay
21:11:22 <strcat[m]> and there has been a lot of disruption tied to it
21:11:36 <strcat[m]> so they scaled back planned features and moved some forward
21:11:42 <strcat[m]> there are still a lot of under the hood changes
21:12:11 <strcat[m]> new Android versions primarily bring features for apps to use with the new API level, performance/stability/privacy/security improvements, and minor polish
21:12:27 <anupritaisno1[m4> Having worked on a huge amount of R bringup
21:12:44 <anupritaisno1[m4> I can say that the code in R allows for a lot cleaner approach
21:12:47 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/features
21:12:51 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy
21:12:54 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/behavior-changes-all
21:13:01 <strcat[m]> those are the changes for app developers
21:13:03 <anupritaisno1[m4> Example see how simple the patch to replace scudo with hardened malloc became
21:13:15 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "there are substantial privacy an"> ...like?
21:13:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> It's fewer lines than the original and already handles both jemalloc and scudo
21:13:32 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "Sheru: Resynth: also unsure why "> They're a billion dollar company. Why can't they do it remotely?
21:13:54 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "and there has been a lot of disr"> There still is, applications crash
21:14:16 <strcat[m]> we haven't had any reports of application crashes other than 1 user saying the camera crashes who didn't provide info like the device or when it happens
21:14:27 <Resynth[m]> Do you work for Google?
21:14:27 <strcat[m]> no issues were reported by the many people beta testing it that weren't addressed already
21:14:40 <strcat[m]> if you have issues they are very likely specific to your configuration / setup since others don't
21:15:02 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "we haven't had any reports of ap"> I talked to most of them already this afternoon
21:15:03 <strcat[m]> there is 1 confirmed issue which I explained: we need to bundle a change to enable the configuration option for 2 button gesture setup
21:15:20 <anupritaisno1[m4> Most of them are hardware issues
21:15:29 <strcat[m]> most people are reporting that the camera is more stable due to the upstream memory corruption bug fixes which reduce the issues caused by hardened_malloc substantially
21:15:40 <strcat[m]> we haven't been able to replicate any issues with it
21:15:41 <Resynth[m]> Good answer strcat :-)
21:16:00 <strcat[m]> if someone is having camera issues we need to know on which device it's happening, and how they are triggering it
21:16:14 <strcat[m]> which camera app, which device, how to trigger it, does it persist after reboot, etc.
21:16:26 <Resynth[m]> I've heard you plan to remove Google Camera SELinux rules from GrapheneOS which truly does suck
21:16:51 <strcat[m]> it's not going to continue working regardless of what we do
21:16:56 <strcat[m]> we don't ship Play services, and won't
21:18:57 <strcat[m]> if someone has an issue please report it with proper details on the tracker, very little has been reported, and we fixed 100% of the reported problems during the long period of beta testing (way longer than what we usually do)
21:19:06 <anupritaisno1[m4> <Resynth[m] "I've heard you plan to remove Go"> Yes, know why?
21:19:10 <strcat[m]> we deliberately didn't plan on shipping the first release via the stable channel
21:19:18 <strcat[m]> that's why we marked it as a preview

21:19:32 <strcat[m]> inthewaves helped a lot with fixing everything that was found / reported
21:19:52 <blacklight447[m]> <Resynth[m] "They're a billion dollar company"> If your familiar with software development, then you know then simply throwing more cash at something won't always make something go faster
21:20:03 <brenneke[m]> <strcat[m] "brenneke: we ship the WebView up"> Good to know thank you, have now blacklisted in Aurora.
21:20:14 <voodoo> Hi, sinds last update (2020.09.25.00) i ma not able to use my banking app , and Aurora store jas Android system webview update whitch gaves a conflict? Antonelli knots soluties for this?
21:20:29 <strcat[m]> brenneke: it's not a security update btw, it's just the minor upgrades they do
21:20:40 <strcat[m]> voodoo: you can't update our WebView to a different one
21:20:56 <strcat[m]> voodoo: app stores should not be suggesting that you try and attempting to do it - that's an Aurora Store issue
21:21:17 <strcat[m]> we aren't trying to ship Vanadium WebView again until Chromium 86 is out
21:21:19 <voodoo> why is Aurora store giving me the update? Never had this before
21:21:41 <strcat[m]> voodoo: because usually we ship the Vanadium WebView and we call it org.grapheneos.vanadium.webview
21:21:47 <strcat[m]> but we're not ready to ship it yet for Android 11
21:21:56 <rainme[m]> just blacklist webview and auditor apps
21:22:00 <rainme[m]> on aurora settings
21:22:01 <strcat[m]> so we're shipping the standard WebView for a couple weeks
21:22:13 <strcat[m]> rainme: updating Auditor from Play Store is fine since they're just our releases
21:22:24 <voodoo> okey, so the banking app issue is because of the vanadium webviuew
21:22:24 <strcat[m]> we release the same upgrades via Play, GitHub and bundled in the OS
21:22:33 <strcat[m]> voodoo: no
21:22:53 <strcat[m]> I'm saying that the reason you can't upgrade the WebView with Aurora Store is because you're trying to update our WebView to one signed with a different key
21:22:54 <strcat[m]> you can't do that
21:23:04 <strcat[m]> the reason it isn't usually a problem is because we ship the Vanadium WebView with a Vanadium name
21:23:23 <strcat[m]> I'm aware that Aurora Store and F-Droid unfortunately try to update apps to versions signed with different keys if they share the app id
21:23:30 <strcat[m]> it's unfortunate, but it's their bug
21:23:45 <strcat[m]> we will be shipping the Vanadium WebView again soon
21:24:00 <strcat[m]> we just didn't want to ship a Beta channel version of Chromium
21:24:03 <voodoo> Oké so I can disable the update in Aurora store
21:24:19 <strcat[m]> I don't know why your banking app doesn't work
21:24:25 <Resynth[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "IMG_20200927_135039_824.jpg"> Physical cameras can be expensive. Plus, the Pixel cameras are actually very good, so I'm not sure what that's about. Plus, I don't see anything wrong with taking photos on a phone camera ...?
21:24:37 <strcat[m]> it's possible it has root detection or something weird that breaks because they didn't plan for Android 11
21:24:47 <strcat[m]> you could check the reviews for the app, etc. and see if other people have issues
21:25:02 <voodoo> still dont understand why my bank app Is not working and crashing since the update
21:25:14 <Resynth[m]> Hmm, well it's good to know the Google Camera app probably won't break when this is removed
21:25:47 <strcat[m]> voodoo: you should look and see if others have issues with the app
21:25:53 * snowkeld[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/QEPEPRpmCnMfGtdoplBMCubm/message.txt >
21:25:54 <strcat[m]> look at the reviews on the Play Store assuming that's where you get it
21:25:55 <voodoo> okey thans you
21:26:14 <voodoo> Aurora store, i dont have plan store
21:26:24 <strcat[m]> voodoo: banking apps tend to have weird stuff like root detection
21:26:33 <strcat[m]> voodoo: well Aurora Store is an open source Play Store client
21:26:33 <Resynth[m]> <voodoo "Aurora store, i dont have plan s"> ...same thing.
21:26:39 <strcat[m]> so look at reviews on the Play Store for it
21:27:08 <strcat[m]> oh and for whatever reason due to COVID-19 app reviews take a long time
21:27:21 <strcat[m]> so it takes more time than usual for app developers to be able to push out updates via the Play Store
21:27:25 <strcat[m]> sometimes your update gets delayed by 1-2 weeks atm
21:27:49 <strcat[m]> so it's possible your bank is aware of the issue, fixed the problem, and their update is being reviewed atm - who knows
21:27:55 <adeus[m]> strcat: hey Daniel, I asked this yesterday no one answered maybe you can help ... when you create a secondary profile it creates its own encryption section for that profile within the main encryption? So secondary accounts benefit from two levels of encryption (master account + secondary) ?
21:28:43 <strcat[m]> adeus: each user profile has an encryption key based on the primary unlock method and other inputs to key derivation
21:28:52 <strcat[m]> it's not layered, they're separate
21:29:03 <adeus[m]> Oh
21:29:24 <strcat[m]> the reason the main profile has to be logged in is because certain system apps, etc. run as the primary owner user
21:29:41 <strcat[m]> so if you want to use profiles to separate your sensitive data, etc.
21:29:53 <strcat[m]> I would recommend putting the sensitive stuff in a secondary profile, not the owner profile
21:30:03 <strcat[m]> minimize usage of the owner profile if anything
21:30:10 <strcat[m]> because it always has to be logged in
21:30:17 <strcat[m]> for the device to be functional
21:30:21 <adeus[m]> <strcat[m] "minimize usage of the owner prof"> Copy. Treat it like an admin super user account.
21:30:35 <strcat[m]> yeah although it barely has any powers other than setting limits on what other users can do
21:30:39 <strcat[m]> it can't look at their data or anything
21:30:59 <strcat[m]> and the Settings app doesn't expose most of that functionality atm
21:31:01 <strcat[m]> we could expose more
21:31:02 <Resynth[m]> Hmm
21:31:11 <strcat[m]> most of it is pretty boring / useless functionality for a regular user though
21:31:46 <strcat[m]> some bits would be useful to add
21:32:18 <voodoo> Is there an app to use this chat instemde of browser like i use now?
21:32:32 <strcat[m]> yes
21:32:41 <strcat[m]> you can use any IRC or Matrix client
21:33:04 <strcat[m]> looking into https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/336 atm
21:33:28 <strcat[m]> so afaict there are assorted stub apps that exist simply to provide basic overlays
21:33:38 <strcat[m]> the issue is that we're including the 3 button one but not the 2 button one, afaik
21:33:52 <strcat[m]> although 2 button nav does work, the setting just doesn't show up in the Settings GUI
21:36:16 <strcat[m]> yeah so atm we include NavigationBarMode3Button, NavigationBarModeGestural, NavigationBarModeGesturalExtraWideBack, NavigationBarModeGesturalNarrowBack, NavigationBarModeGesturalWideBack
21:36:22 <strcat[m]> we probably just need to add one of those overlay apps - simple
21:37:47 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/f8774ab5b561de9960356c6e7601fae44864c2a2
21:37:54 <strcat[m]> probably fixed already, 15 seconds of work
21:46:12 <strcat[m]> also worth noting we don't have maintainers for Pixel 2, 2 XL, 3, 3 XL, 3a, 3 XL
21:46:18 <strcat[m]> we only have dedicated maintainers for 4 and 4 XL
22:12:09 <x61[m]> hello
22:12:25 <x61[m]> anyone is having problems with captive-portals withs the last 3 releases?
22:12:47 <x61[m]> like never load the website to enter to the portal?
22:33:18 <strcat[m]> 𝚐𝚘𝚗𝚣𝚊𝚕𝚘: are you using a VPN?
23:18:57 <traffickpolize[m> I am interested in GrapheneOS, but there's no device you can get real work done on it that's as secure. Am I missing the point?
23:20:23 <x61[m]> <strcat[m] "𝚐𝚘𝚗𝚣𝚊𝚕𝚘: are you using a "> yes, wireguard, but i tried also with it disable
23:20:31 <x61[m]> no luck, before was working fine, same with "sign in the network"
23:23:22 <strcat[m]> traffickpolize: not sure what you mean
23:25:01 <x61[m]> <traffickpolize[m "I am interested in GrapheneOS, b"> do you mean that GrapheneOS could be secure but not your phone?
23:25:19 <x61[m]> you have that everywhere, there is no way to be sure about everything or anything
23:26:01 <traffickpolize[m> My thought is my phone is more secure than my PC so why bother?
23:26:21 <x61[m]> i don't think so
23:27:46 <traffickpolize[m> Not sure what you mean
23:28:01 <x61[m]> i don't think your phone is more secure than your pc
23:28:09 <x61[m]> well, depends on what you have on your pc
23:28:12 <Sheru[m]> <Resynth[m] "They're a billion dollar company"> that's kinda moot, (offtopic), but if Google restricts ad targeting/personalization like Apple does, they'll be in trouble
23:28:17 <x61[m]> depends on tons of things
23:38:45 <strcat[m]> traffickpolize: it's not clear what you're trying to get across
23:39:16 <strcat[m]> the point of GrapheneOS is to make a more private and secure mobile OS
23:39:57 <madaidan[m]> <x61[m] "i don't think your phone is more"> It definitely is.
23:41:14 <strcat[m]> our goal is not solving all problems in the world for all people
23:41:36 <strcat[m]> if you want to build on the existing the free form window mode support and add support for different form factor devices you're free to do that
23:41:38 <strcat[m]> it's not our focus
23:42:59 <strcat[m]> lots of people heavily use their phones including doing 'real work' on them and they are much more likely to be carried around everywhere than a laptop
23:43:06 <strcat[m]> but regardless, it's offtopic, and doesn't belong here
23:45:36 <traffickpolize[m> strcat: thanks
