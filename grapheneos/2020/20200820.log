12:42:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <mastercakex[m] "Ok the flip side maybe it's good"> It wasn't meant for the masses on the sense that they use apps with hard play services dependency without any website version for such servcies
12:43:00 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> For starters, not everyone can flash other OS in their Android phones
12:43:58 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <mastercakex[m] "Ok the flip side maybe it's good"> Relatively, it is more stable than other custom OS, and it's been updated regularly
12:45:51 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * It is restarting back, the better term for it, if you mean feature-wise. The nature of open source project development depends on contributors too (the more contributors stepping up even on small things, more features will be tested, implemeted)
12:46:24 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> My apologies for misunderstanding, but calling it a beta project seems unfitting
12:48:01 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Well then, I'd agree as long as I see an evidence of him saying so.
12:48:30 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I only remembered him saying it is not for masses
12:48:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Due to security enhancements and not implementing something like microG
12:51:15 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> For it being "beta", it was more of the default apps and absence of first-party app store iirc
12:54:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I can't find it on website nor on channel logs, my apologies...
14:13:02 <hultan[m]> Is it not possible to have one phone language (in my case English for menus, settings etc), and another for spell checking (in my case primarily Swedish), in GrapheneOS?
14:17:16 <hultan[m]> I have been speaking Swedish for nearly 50 years now, but having the Swedish language in the Settings menu, means that I will understand what 5% of the settings do, instead of 50% in English...I am just that dense :-).... but I have to communicate with colleagues in Swedish, so in emails etc I want Swedish spell checking.
14:20:20 <hultan[m]> Hmm...ok, so the language at the top of the language list, controls the language used in the phone, and then I have to change the language in the keyboard widget (?) when I write an email, correct? I can live with that...
14:24:16 <bigday> hello
14:24:17 <bigday> guys
14:24:34 <bigday> i want to ask you guys about somthing strange
14:24:57 <bigday> i have pixel 3 , with grapheneos , only installed Fdroid and aurora store
14:25:14 <bigday> and what's app business
14:26:07 <bigday> i forwarded a pdf using what's app business countaing some banking information
14:26:55 <bigday> the recipient received it , with a blacked out . account and company
14:27:26 <bigday> i didn't do it any explanation or the recipient is just playing me
14:34:15 <dazinism> bigday: i've never used whatsapp, but sounds weird/unlikely unless its some kind of security in WhatsApp business?
14:34:51 <dazinism> But I think thats also unlikely
14:35:52 <dazinism> Maybe if you are doing business with/out of China USA is blocking you
14:35:55 <YouCanGhostMyKat> If I just follow the Google docs for WiFi calling can I get that enabled for GrapheneOS or is this not advisable?
14:36:01 <dazinism> (Bad joke)
14:37:57 <YouCanGhostMyKat> Or do I just need to enable the WiFi calling feature in Signal?
14:38:42 <bigday> yeah i think i'm being trolled
14:38:50 <dazinism> I think WiFi calling may not work in GrapheneOS
14:38:51 <bigday> i will try to send it to someone else and see
14:39:44 <YouCanGhostMyKat> dazinism: Should I just take advantage of the internal SIP feature in Graphene then?
14:39:55 <dazinism> Signal calls would work over WiFi. Not sure what you mean by enable wifi calling there?
14:39:56 <YouCanGhostMyKat> * dazinism: Should I just take advantage of the internal SIP feature in GrapheneOS then?
14:40:28 <dazinism> I could be wrong about WiFi calling, probably best to check the logs
14:41:23 <dazinism> I think the internal AOSP sip stuff doesnt work as good as some SIP apps
14:43:49 <YouCanGhostMyKat> WiFi calling works. Never mind. Just tested it again.
14:47:27 <derpy> @bigday could be a whatsapp biz security feature... or you're being trolled

14:57:13 <derpy> Forgot who the main dev is in here...
14:57:22 <derpy> Wanted to ask them if this would work on grapheneOS: https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/86zkzf/restoring_wifi_passwords_from_old_device/
14:57:35 <Autopsy[m]> <derpy "Forgot who the main dev is in he"> strcat
14:57:48 <derpy> tnx
16:00:37 <dazinism> derpy: sounds like it should work. Maybe give it a try
16:01:49 <dazinism> if you can get a backup with the data you need adb restore may work for putting it all on the new device
16:02:06 <bigday> guess i try to check i'm uptodate
16:02:14 <bigday> but nothing happnes
16:02:28 <bigday> no message to tell me if i need and update or no
16:02:29 <dazinism> not sure if seedvault backups restore WiFi settings
16:02:34 <dazinism> anyone tried?
16:03:12 <dazinism> bigday: checks happen automatically. Don't really need to do anything
16:04:33 <bigday> that's nice
16:05:24 <dazinism> You get a notification telling you that you need to restart
16:06:41 <bigday> sometimes from time to time i like to check manually
16:07:19 <dazinism> Checks are done automatically every few hours
16:08:53 <dazinism> Also any updates tend to get announced here, and on the GrapheneOS Twitter and Reddit
16:09:56 <bigday> i think i need to joind that twitter channel then
16:12:07 <dazinism> Generally theres an update  first Monday or Tuesday of the month, some months can get another one or two.
16:12:49 <dazinism> announcements happen when a release is tagged. Its sometime after that updates go out on the beta channel
16:12:50 <bigday> any idea we suggest thing user side
16:12:58 <bigday> not security suggestions
16:13:47 <dazinism> can be a fair few hours (maybe sometimes a day)after that before updates are avialable on the stable channel
16:15:35 <dazinism> The project is focused on security and privacy. Theres not any desire to do anything else
16:16:15 <dazinism> other features tale resources to develop, check they are robust and then to maintain as AOSP changes
16:16:37 <bigday> so suggestion for more customization for the launcher
16:16:50 <dazinism> the less changes compared to AOSP, the easier it is to sustain the project
16:17:07 <bigday> will not be taken inconsideration =(
16:17:14 <erhcetua[m]> <bigday "so suggestion for more customiza"> you are free to contribute
16:18:29 <bigday> i wish i can i'm as any one could be from being a programer
16:20:33 <dazinism> I don't think theres anyone who would work on your suggestions. Currently everyone is busy in maintenance or trying to get old features, that have stopped working to work again.
16:20:51 <dazinism> there are other launchers that you could use
16:22:31 <nickcalyx[m]> > not sure if seedvault backups restore WiFi settings
16:22:31 <nickcalyx[m]> It does
16:23:08 <dazinism> Lots of them. If you really want other features you would probably find them elsewhere. Safest to stay using the GrapheneOS launcher.
16:25:09 <dazinism> derpy: the fact seedvault restores WiFi settings makes it more likely that adb backup and then adb restore will work for you
16:34:07 <derpy> @dazinism seedvault being the same for grapheneOS and Google's Android?
16:41:13 <dazinism> derpy: no, its seedvault is not in stock, just it uses the same internal stuff as adb backup uses. So you should be able to follow that guide.
16:41:46 <dazinism> If that works you may well be able to restore the file you get from adb backup
16:41:52 <dazinism> using adb restore
16:42:27 <dazinism> You moving from stock to GrapheneOS on the same device?
16:42:38 <derpy> Different device. Pixel 1 -> 3a
16:43:33 <derpy> dazinism why is there an easier way to migrate with two different devices?
16:43:51 <dazinism> adb restore may still work.
16:45:08 <dazinism> if you had Google Play Services on both then its likely the Google Backup would work
16:45:35 <derpy> right...
16:45:45 <dazinism> once your on GrapheneOS you can use Seedvault to migrate to another device with Seedvault
16:45:59 <derpy> well I just installed Google Maps from the Aurora Store, for teh rare times I need it on GOS
16:46:14 <derpy> cool
16:46:51 <dazinism> I just use the OSMand or if I need to check traffic use Google maps website
16:47:58 <derpy> you know... you're drunk in a taxi and everyone's phone is dead, and they're asking for google maps..
16:48:05 <derpy> shit like that...
16:48:19 <derpy> would like to use the apps sometimes just not have them doing anything when closed
16:48:31 <derpy> apps meaning some that need google services
16:48:53 <bigday> derpy if iam understanding correct
16:48:59 <bigday> you can go calyx
16:49:32 <derpy> still stay on grapheneOS, just bought a pixel for it)
16:49:55 <derpy> the unlock screen is a bit sluggish with the *** password characters coming up slowly... is this normal?
16:49:57 <bigday> i think that the difference between them is micro G
16:50:09 <bigday> i'm on graphene
16:50:11 <derpy> which source did you install Signal from? Signal's website?
16:50:42 <derpy> I kinda trust signal less than telegram because I think signal is a snowden promoted psyop... ya, damn conspiracy theorists :(
16:52:29 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
16:52:48 <dazinism> Derpy: have a look there
16:53:17 <derpy> meaning the recommended place is signal.org ... ok
16:53:41 <derpy> so just enabled signal to be allowed to install apps

18:31:14 <nikitalita[m]> I don't think Firefox is ever going to be able to turn things around at this point, unfortunately
18:33:12 <nikitalita[m]> They just fired the teams that ensured their core product that actually made them money had a future, and they seem to be instead concentrating on cloud services that nobody cares about
18:33:35 <nikitalita[m]> and their main source of revenue is their primary competitor
18:34:37 <aeonsolution[m]> it is, what it is, we should just give people the information and let them weigh the pros and cons for themselves; yeah the recent layoffs definitely don't help
18:36:15 <bigchunk> what about brave

18:38:12 <bigchunk> i tried to use the clock app

18:50:37 <Autopsy[m]> Everyone does it, so it must be okay
18:50:43 <erhcetua[m]> talk in offtopic
18:51:16 <erhcetua[m]> annoying that people can't read rules
18:51:35 <Autopsy[m]> Waze may or may not need Google services to run. Since GrapheneOS doesn't have that, you may struggle to install certain apps.
18:52:07 <Autopsy[m]> Use another app, or stick to the speed limit.
18:54:44 <Autopsy[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=Waze&ch=grapheneos a quick search would've shown that Waze is pretty much a no go on GrapheneOS.
19:00:48 <bigchunk> i would suggested to make a list that can be updated monthly for post graphene flash with a list of apps that is considered okay and will help new commers get going
19:04:01 <nikitalita[m]> is there a decent whitepaper on how the Titan M works? I'm not able to turn up much besides the google blog post announcing it
20:18:23 <aeonsolution[m]> can any of the devs help me understand how Android Mainline works and how it helps with GrapheneOS development? is it useful for backporting kernel patches?
20:19:18 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "can any of the devs help me unde"> it doesn't help GrapheneOS at all
20:19:26 <cn3m[m]> it breaks up components from AOSP and ships them over Play Store
20:19:32 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS builds from AOSP
20:19:45 <cn3m[m]> so it doesn't apply
20:19:49 <cn3m[m]> it only helps unsupported devices
20:19:50 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't support unsupported devices
20:19:55 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, perfect; kicking it out of my brain now
20:23:01 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: thank you
20:24:43 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "cn3m: thank you"> cheers ðŸ™‚
20:26:42 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution backporting kernel patches is a real PITA. Binder for example was a failure to backport to XLTS(which Android uses iirc). That is why it effected Pixel 2, but not 3 and 4
20:27:18 <cn3m[m]> if you are interested in the subject you should watch this video
20:27:41 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Kza6fdkSU

20:41:56 <nikitalita[m]> sweet
20:42:13 <Autopsy[m]> riotuser1993 your serial number is on show.
20:42:36 <dazinism> nikitalita: also maybe https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore#HardwareSecurityModule
20:45:10 <Biruwa> Which device has the best support status currently? Should I go with the Pixel 3a, or the Pixel 4a?
20:45:32 <Biruwa> I'm looking for something that has good support out of the box, and will remain supported for 2+ years down the line.
20:47:43 <M79k83mw4y533hon> I just bought 3a xl because bigger screen and cheaper (~200 on ebay).
20:47:43 <M79k83mw4y533hon> pixel 4a has better hardware but I'd rather spend less now and wait for 5a/6a which hopefully has wireless charging
20:48:27 <Biruwa> Thank you.
20:48:40 <aeonsolution[m]> riotuser1993: you should be using powershell
20:49:07 <aeonsolution[m]> and following the instructions on https://grapheneos.org/install
20:50:56 <nickcalyx[m]> Great deal
20:51:20 <Biruwa> Okay, so it looks like the Google Pixel 5 will be coming out this fall.
20:51:31 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
20:51:43 <nikitalita[m]> they usually announce in October
20:51:52 <Biruwa> Would it make sense to wait for that device's release (plus an additional amount of time for support to be added), instead of getting a Pixel 3a with GrapheneOS?
20:52:14 <nikitalita[m]> pixel 3a is pretty cheap right now and it might be a while until pixel 5 is suppoted
20:52:22 <nikitalita[m]>  * pixel 3a is pretty cheap right now and it might be a while until pixel 5 is supported
20:52:59 <Biruwa> Which device do you personally use yourself?
20:53:14 <nikitalita[m]> How long was it until Pixel 4 and 4xl was supported? It was last month I think?
20:53:26 <nikitalita[m]> I'm using a Pixel 4 right now, works great
20:54:00 <Biruwa> Thank you.
20:54:14 <Biruwa> I'm looking at second hand prices right now. Maybe I'll get the Pixel 3a as it is the cheapest.
20:55:36 <Biruwa> How is the camera support on GrapheneOS?
20:55:43 <Biruwa> Does the front and rear cameras work?
20:56:41 <nikitalita[m]> yep
21:02:42 <nikitalita[m]> zombieworld: which Google camera app are you referring to?
21:05:43 <nikitalita[m]> the AOSP camera app is pretty bare bones, yeah
21:06:12 <nikitalita[m]> I don't think I've actually tried the Google one on Pixels
21:06:21 <Biruwa> Oh, so it sounds like while the camera is supported on GrapheneOS, it depends on the specific app?
21:06:34 <Biruwa> Okay. Well, I don't care too much about my phone's camera anyways. So it should be all good :)
21:06:36 <nikitalita[m]> no, any camera app will work
21:06:54 <charlesql[m]> hey I just saw grapheneOS can create up to 16 users, is that true?
21:07:25 <Biruwa> Does GrapheneOS support dual sim?
21:07:33 <nikitalita[m]> I don't think there's any core functionality breakage on the officially supported non-legacy Pixels besides the lack of google services?
21:07:49 <Biruwa> Ah, okay. Thank you for clarifying.
21:08:05 <charlesql[m]> <Biruwa "Does GrapheneOS support dual sim"> but pixels have just 1 sim card slot...
21:08:20 <refragable[m]> Biruwa: You can use any camera app, the stock one in AOSP is just unmaintained. The Google one just has algorithms and direct access to the hardware to improve the picture quality. And eSIM is not supported in GrapheneOS
21:08:35 <Biruwa> Alright, thank you for letting me know.
21:08:38 <refragable[m]> charlesql: yes, the limit is 16 users in GrapheneOS
21:08:49 <nikitalita[m]> <charlesql[m] "hey I just saw grapheneOS can cr"> I dunno, why don't you test it out?
21:10:11 <charlesql[m]> <refragable[m] "charlesql: yes, the limit is 16 "> is it easy to switch between users?
21:10:33 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
21:10:35 <charlesql[m]> <nikitalita[m] "I dunno, why don't you test it o"> I wish, but my Pixel 3 is broken. Im waiting to buy 4a
21:10:47 <charlesql[m]> <nikitalita[m] "yeah"> awesome! Thanksss
21:10:52 <nikitalita[m]> drag down the options menu, click the profile button in the bottom right, switch
21:11:03 <charlesql[m]> <nikitalita[m] "drag down the options menu, clic"> so same as stock Android
21:11:11 <nikitalita[m]> pretty much
21:11:13 <charlesql[m]> <nikitalita[m] "drag down the options menu, clic"> I CANT BELIEVE I DONT EVEN KNOW THIS!
21:22:36 <dazinism> Theres a load of info about user profiles here

21:26:23 <likethatt12[m]> In your opinion, what are the real uses of graphene? Like where are u actually able to exploit all of its functionality?
21:26:43 <nikitalita[m]> what do you mean?
21:28:55 <nikitalita[m]> imo the main features of grapheneos are security and privacy, and that it's based on android so you can still run android apps (that don't require google play services)
21:29:05 <likethatt12[m]> i wanted to have in mind some other special features that i didn't know
21:29:28 <nikitalita[m]> there's not really any special fancy usability features
21:32:50 <nikitalita[m]> I don't need any of those on my phone, so I don't really care about 'em
21:33:34 <likethatt12[m]> Sure, the security and privacy aspects are what atractted me. Then I also discovered linux so I'm just thinking how to compartmentalize my virtual existence
21:35:41 <likethatt12[m]> xD anyway, I don't have a pixel so in the meanwhile f-droid and another tools are pretty cool
21:36:19 <nikitalita[m]> likethatt12: what apps do you tend to use on android?
21:37:56 <likethatt12[m]> social media, youtube, some writing and music
21:38:05 <nikitalita[m]> basically, grapheneOS will be fine if you don't need to rely on a proprietary app that uses google services (for which you can't find a FOSS replacement that doesn't use google services)
21:38:30 <likethatt12[m]> yep
21:39:23 <nikitalita[m]> so for youtube, I use newpipe, for twitter I'm using twidere, I've stopped using facebook entirely because fuck them, for notes I'm using Standard Notes
21:40:33 <likethatt12[m]> is spotify available there?
21:40:53 <nikitalita[m]> a good question
21:41:03 <nikitalita[m]> anyone use spotify on grapheneos?
21:41:18 <likethatt12[m]> i don't this it's really dependant on google services
21:41:23 <nikitalita[m]> oh, nice
21:43:24 <nikitalita[m]> likethatt12: the main problem is that some of these apps rely on google play services. it's not always obvious when they do until you try them and test to see if they break or not
21:44:08 <nikitalita[m]> zombieworld: offtopic, yo
21:45:37 <nikitalita[m]> likethatt12: actually, have you tried spotify on the mobile browser to see if that works?
21:51:14 <Autopsy[m]> <nikitalita[m] "anyone use spotify on grapheneos"> Yes
21:51:48 <nikitalita[m]> did you have to do anything special to get that to work?
21:52:12 <Autopsy[m]> Nope, nothing
21:52:14 <Autopsy[m]> Just works
21:52:19 <nikitalita[m]> cool
22:25:57 <charlesql[m]> <nikitalita[m] "anyone use spotify on grapheneos"> I dont use spotify anymore, but I remembered last year when I had Spotify on my graphene it was fine
22:27:42 <charlesql[m]> another question: so with Android multiple users even if you switch from user A to user B apps in user A can still run in background even if you are on user B...what about graphene?
22:27:55 <charlesql[m]> Cant find anything related on graphene's website
23:36:12 <spoonhoarder82[m> Hi all, I just put Graphene OS on a pixel 4xl a few days ago, love it.  Everything is great thus far.  But I cannot get VoLTE or WiFi calling to work on AT&T.  Anyone know if that is possible, and if not it work if I switch back to Verizon as I've heard?
23:37:25 <nikitalita[m]> spoonhoarder82: yeah, I've had similar issues
23:37:39 <nikitalita[m]> there's someone working on it in the issue tracker right now, I think
23:38:00 <nikitalita[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/153
23:38:15 <nikitalita[m]> he was able to get it to work for Verizon, but hasn't been able to generally for other carriers
