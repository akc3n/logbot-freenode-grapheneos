01:03:09 <overheadscallop[> crueltekk: I think you're missing ncurses
01:13:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> crueltekk: tbh use archlinux
01:41:50 <ananteris[m]> have some fucking self respect
01:46:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> Arch if no security is needed, Win10 if a little security is needed, and GrapheneOS or iOS if real security is needed.
01:47:24 <rover1[m]> why desktop os less option for security and privacy than mobile?
01:47:28 <rover1[m]> lack of devs?
01:47:35 <JTL> Lack of application sandboxing for one
01:49:50 <cyborgninjaneer[> The way desktops work isn't designed for security. It was designed for flexibility 30+ years ago, and basically patched instead of fixed as the internet and hacking came along.
01:51:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> Win10 at least has a semblance of security. Idk about MacOS. Linux is not secure unless it's buried inside GrapheneOS
02:34:24 <BalooRJ> Looks like GrapheneOS is gaining some steam

02:34:52 <mxnorvak[m]> A few thoughts about Signal’s Secure Value Recovery – A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering
02:34:52 <mxnorvak[m]> https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/
02:37:05 <mxnorvak[m]> No mention of this
02:37:22 <mxnorvak[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1277777722916442113?s=20
02:40:51 <BalooRJ> some of those replies are cancer...Signal is not user hostile, they're attempting to create a 2FA or account recovery option that is not subject to sim jacking like Telegram, which has already stated they're willing to give away user data
02:41:45 <BalooRJ> though I do think Daniel is right, if you allow for a local backup for Signal these problems will simply go away, rather than asking for user info.
02:43:13 <cyborgninjaneer[> I don't like the way Signal designed their cloud storage/backup. I will opt out as soon as they make that an option.
02:45:48 <BalooRJ> https://nitter.net/DanielMicay/status/1281435834059718656#m
02:45:55 <BalooRJ> Guess I stand corrected, Daniel went in more detail here
02:52:26 <wd40[m]> Can anyone recommend a Password Manager?
02:52:51 <cn3m[m]> <wd40[m] "Can anyone recommend a Password "> KeePassDX or 1Password
02:53:11 <wd40[m]> Thank you
02:53:28 <wd40[m]> Are these on FDroid
02:55:10 <wd40[m]> I found them
02:56:21 <BalooRJ> KeePassDX has a built in keyboard as well that makes it very convenient
02:56:28 <BalooRJ> Curious to those who are skeptical of signal here on the chat
02:56:42 <BalooRJ> I see that Signal does have the ability to back up messages locally with an encrypted password
02:57:07 <BalooRJ> So is the reason this is not touted over the 4-digit pin and uploading to the cloud reason for controversy? If so I understand now
02:58:43 <cyborgninjaneer[> Mandatory storage of information about user = bad
02:59:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Local only storage = good
02:59:11 <BalooRJ> What is Signal exactly keeping of the user aside from the phone number?
02:59:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> Optional zero access cloud storage = good
02:59:25 <BalooRJ> I was under the impression the pin was only for if anyone else were to use your phone number to register for signal if you lost your phone
02:59:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> > What is Signal exactly keeping of the user aside from the phone number?
02:59:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> All of their contacts. Very sensitive information
02:59:57 <BalooRJ> That's pretty bad, I don't see why they need my contacts in the first place.
03:00:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> > I was under the impression the pin was only for if anyone else were to use your phone number to register for signal if you lost your phone
03:00:10 <cyborgninjaneer[> That's what I thought too until after the app fucking forced me to make a PIN.
03:00:24 <BalooRJ> Can signal still function if you deny it access to your contacts?
03:01:10 <f8sai[m]> <BalooRJ "Can signal still function if you"> Yes
03:01:14 <wd40[m]> I thought that the CO sounded shady. People were complaining about the pin AND the cloud backups he decided to make the pin optional but not the backups
03:01:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> Fuckers already got my contacts because I didn't know to disable it before making my pin.
03:01:49 <BalooRJ> I use Etesync to sync my contacts across devices in an encrypted manner, don't need Signal to do it as well
03:01:55 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm pissed as hell.
03:02:00 <wd40[m]> Unless something has changed since I was on the forum
03:03:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm even more pissed because there is no alternative to Signal.
03:04:00 <BalooRJ> Telegram and WhatsApp are untrustworthy, and XMPP is way less intuitive to use and unless you're spinning up your own server to host your messages on you still have to trust another server
03:04:51 <rover1[m]> there decentralized messenger
03:05:23 <wd40[m]> Is reminds me of Straight Talk. They will block your credit card if you buy too many sims. This seems like a way to know your contacts and other numbers you maybe using associated. The reasoning about not loosing contacts doesn't make good sense.
03:05:45 <f8sai[m]> Time to hoard sims \s
03:07:23 <BalooRJ> anyone have a recommendation for a NAS that works well with both Jellyfin and Nextcloud?
03:08:04 <wd40[m]> Synology maybe
03:08:17 <wd40[m]> KeePassDX or 1Password
03:08:31 <wd40[m]> KeePassDX or 1Password
03:08:44 <wd40[m]> Any recommendations on these?
03:08:52 <rover1[m]> raspberry pi 3 or 4
03:09:17 <f8sai[m]> <wd40[m] "KeePassDX or 1Password"> KeepassDX
03:09:20 <f8sai[m]> Works offline
03:09:20 <mxnorvak[m]> Daniel has written all there is to be discussed about this in his Twitter and they all are very valid criticisms that no one talks about and that's what is super annoying, how no one is paying attention to it and are just annoyed by the mandatory PIN
03:09:23 <f8sai[m]> Open source
03:09:25 <f8sai[m]> Has keyboard
03:09:31 <BalooRJ> KeepassDX
03:09:41 <BalooRJ> F-Droid and the keyboard makes it very easy to use
03:09:52 <BalooRJ> pluss cross compatible with KeePassXC on desktop, I use KeePassXC on Linux
03:10:12 <BalooRJ> Thanks, I'll look into the Synology
03:10:18 <wd40[m]> mxnorvak:  that's what I was thinking reading the forum. F the pin. The backup is the problem
03:10:46 <wd40[m]> @f8sai:privacytools.io:  cool. Giving that a try
03:11:09 <wd40[m]> Keepass it is
03:12:31 <cyborgninjaneer[> mxnorvak: That article suggests PINs were made optional this week. Is that true? I don't see an update yet.
03:13:14 <mxnorvak[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "mxnorvak: That article suggests "> Not in the stable version yet, its been rolled out to beta i guess
03:13:26 <f8sai[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Not in the stable version yet, i"> On beta yes
03:13:53 <cyborgninjaneer[> I wonder if there's a way to start contacting Signal Foundation sponsors and get them to threaten to pull funding over the backup thing
03:13:57 <faxing[m]> What mandatory PIN?
03:13:59 <faxing[m]> oh
03:14:01 <faxing[m]> for signal

03:15:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Backups aren't secure, yet they are mandatory.

03:15:43 <f8sai[m]> One can mitigate this by having lots of sims sadly
03:16:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> I never agreed to Signal storing my motherfucking contacts. They just pulled a Facebook-style enforced consent move.
03:20:01 <mxnorvak[m]> I haven't seen enough reason for having the SVR in the first place when it could have been done by storing the contacts in the signal app itself
03:20:01 <mxnorvak[m]> And now that they're giving the users the option to opt out, its still annoying because you'll lose your contacts after each reinstall and also i think you won't be able to set a PIN for registration lock

03:21:00 <faxing[m]> Is there a way to login to a twitter account and tweet from nitter
03:21:13 <f8sai[m]> <faxing[m] "Is there a way to login to a twi"> Nope
03:21:19 <faxing[m]> i deleted twitter but it'd be a good way to keep up with things and be active without all of the tracking

03:21:21 <faxing[m]> rip
03:21:24 <faxing[m]> thanks for the info
03:26:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> I think Signal may have broken the law. Their privacy policy doesn't allow for storing contacts, only transferring hashes of them for contact discovery.
03:27:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm not sure. I'm not an attorney.
03:45:24 <overheadscallop[> <faxing[m] "Is there a way to login to a twi"> There is no such functionality at this time, but the dev plans to add it in the future https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/issues/155

10:21:56 <g65434-2[m]> you can tailor it to your needs
10:22:51 <crueltekk[m]> I know that arch hase some huge benefits. But Ubuntu is the official dev os for android but it sucks hard AF.
10:23:14 <g65434-2[m]> plus its not a fork so less bugs, no forced snap/flatpack or whatever crap nobody needs
10:23:35 <g65434-2[m]> pretty sure you can figure things out on arch wiki
10:24:45 <g65434-2[m]> arch install takes 30 minutes from partitionning to getting on your DE

13:38:14 <alicebobandeve[m> pikey: I have no idea but that's definitely not GOS. Knowing strcat he would probably disable that feature in GOS if it ever existed in AOSP.
13:58:28 <pikey[m]> thanks. i am a bit paranoid now! i will try to get a screenshot when it happens again
14:07:22 * pikey[m] uploaded an image: signal.png (194KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/vGpsJVwNoozAWPaMsZLKhOoG >
14:09:43 <pikey[m]> see it at the bottom. if i make any phone call and hang up either before they answer or after going to voicemail (maybe its just on a timer, any call under 10 seconds or similar), it pops that up to send a msg. I sometimes get other ones too, i think its if someone calls me and i reject the call, it pops up something like "send message to say xxxx" (xxxx varies, such as "I'll call you back" or "can't talk right now".).
14:09:43 <pikey[m]> As I don't install much and the last thing on earth I would install is any kind of app or feature to do stuff like that, I just assumed it was prebuilt into Android 10 and left there by GOS
14:11:07 <dallemon[m]> pikey: i'm sure it's a standard AOSP feature. just made a quick test on my phone, same thing pops up
14:11:57 <pikey[m]> aah. thanks
14:12:25 <pikey[m]> it 'felt' like a native feature. As I was on iphones for years until now, and no Android use before Graphene, I had no clue where it came from. I can live with it, but would turn it off if I could.

15:45:12 <airbender15[m]1> Or do they have me locked bc of the imei
15:45:29 <airbender15[m]1> * If I’m trying avoiding surveillance and have used pixel 3 for. A tear regularly and want to start a new digital life
15:45:35 <cn3m[m]> airbender15: you are totally fine
15:45:52 <cn3m[m]> IMEI is essentially dead in Android 10(it is dead)
15:46:10 <airbender15[m]1> What do you mean it’s dead
15:48:00 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#hardware-identifiers
15:50:02 <airbender15[m]1> How about the simcard?
15:50:12 <airbender15[m]1> Is that a hardware identifier?
15:50:43 <airbender15[m]1> Sim serial number the same thing?
15:50:48 <spaceinfinite[m]> <airbender15[m]1 "What do you mean it’s dead"> he means its dead as apps cant see it. but if you used the phone before and now want to use it anonymously than better not to insert a sim on it and just use wifi then the imei its really dead
15:51:31 <spaceinfinite[m]> after factory reset and graphene on it no sim and only wifi is basically a new phone
15:52:23 <spaceinfinite[m]> and use a new sim on a cheap phone and hotspot from it
15:53:24 <airbender15[m]1> I’m really needing my phone number though
15:53:35 <airbender15[m]1> It’s business related unfortunately
15:54:20 <airbender15[m]1> If I sold this one and bought new one is it safe to use my same sim
15:56:15 <spaceinfinite[m]> if you trying to avoid survelliance as you said then the phone wont help you much if you use same sim on new phone then the network of the sim will know your new imei of the new phone
15:56:53 <airbender15[m]1> So it relies on my network
15:57:13 <spaceinfinite[m]> basically the sim identifies the imei every time u make a normal phone call or send a simple sms
15:57:50 <airbender15[m]1> Ok
15:58:03 <airbender15[m]1> I can’t remember if they have my name or not
15:58:26 <spaceinfinite[m]> hence the idea put your sim on a cheap phone to use and hotspot the graphene from it. slap a vpn aswell and you good
16:00:10 <spaceinfinite[m]> <airbender15[m]1 "I can’t remember if they have my"> depends what you trying to avoid really
16:00:27 <airbender15[m]1> I just want to be difficult

16:17:55 <f8sai[m]> Pros and cons of boot password + lock password and only boot password?
16:18:45 <f8sai[m]> Also, before AFU, no profiles can be accessed, no connections can be toggled at lock screen and you can do no notif at all, right?
16:18:55 <f8sai[m]> Or can you have it while hiding just sensitive content!
16:18:59 <f8sai[m]> ?"
16:19:29 <f8sai[m]> It's a good habit to restart your phones frequently afaik
16:28:04 <f8sai[m]> Somebody told me that some other's GrapheneOS phone has a boot lock password
16:28:10 <f8sai[m]> It's modified right?
16:30:02 <defconanon010102> I don't know if this happened to anyone during a first booting of GOS beta release. Even when I toggled and I didn't want to use my network. It was on by default. Specifically mobile network.
16:31:09 <defconanon010102> This is in GOS's welcome menu by the way.
16:39:52 <alicebobandeve[m> defconanon010102: replied
17:12:43 <strcat[m]> @f8sai:privacytools.io: there is no such thing as a 'boot password', encryption is per-profile
17:13:00 <strcat[m]> each profile has an encryption key based on the lock method, it is no longer 1 global encryption key
17:13:29 <strcat[m]> there is no GrapheneOS device where that isn't the case
17:13:41 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't make sense to go back to how it was
17:14:42 <strcat[m]> @f8sai:privacytools.io: read https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28 about our plans to improve the secondary unlock feature
17:14:57 <strcat[m]> read the issue and the response to someone with a similar confusion
17:15:17 <f8sai[m]> Yeah, kinda been on a corner to answer the questions earlier. Sorry I had to ask for help
17:21:13 <f8sai[m]> Also, thanks.
18:23:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> @f8sai:privacytools.io: we can go back to the old one and stack the new method
18:23:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> But this is redundant
18:24:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does not increase your security
18:24:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it decreases your performance

18:37:07 <alksjdasidjaosnc> can someone point me to more info about the signal debacle? i cannot find that twitter post
18:41:03 <pikey[m]> There's a signal debacle? yikes!
18:44:19 <alex-resist> Which debacle do you mean?
18:45:06 <JTL> https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/07/10/a-few-thoughts-about-signals-secure-value-recovery/
18:47:45 <alksjdasidjaosnc> excellent summary, thank you for link JTL
18:47:54 <JTL> no problem
18:50:48 <alksjdasidjaosnc> stupid question: I am installing apps from Aurora that have trackers in them, for example, Robinhood. Is setting private DNS to adguard sufficient in blocking these sorts of trackers? I know it isn't 100%, mainly trying to hide from FB\Google\etc
18:53:50 <f8sai[m]> <alksjdasidjaosnc "stupid question: I am installing"> Adguard doesn't block as much as NextDNS
19:03:36 <pikey[m]> Very interesting reading, thanks JTL
19:05:03 <pikey[m]> So is the consensus to turn off this PIN thing (when we can) and turn off registration lock? I felt the push from Signal to make me create a pin code (which I detested, first time Signal app has really pissed me off and made me feel like I was using iOS again!). So I caved and did it. But would like to have no access to stuff stored in "cloud" so I can probably delete the pIN when they allow that. Just wondered if others
19:05:03 <pikey[m]> agree?
19:06:28 <alex-resist> Even if your suggestion works, these processes are very intransparent to the naive user. I've also set a 4-digit PIN, simply because I didn't know what it was for
19:06:39 <alex-resist> Now I regret it. Most users will ever understand what this is for
19:07:29 <pikey[m]> who's suggestion?
19:07:54 <alex-resist> Your suggestion to delete the PIN
19:08:17 <pikey[m]> oh, i see. yes i read that in the above aricle, it was Moxie's suggestion to the author
19:09:07 <pikey[m]> I had no clue what it was, like you. I created a fairly secure 6 digit pin, but ever since then I have wondered if my entire signal chat usage is now only only secured by that 6 digit pin! If so, I might as well use Skype :D
19:09:13 <alex-resist> I'm still reading it, sorry if I was confusing
19:09:29 <pikey[m]> sure, no probs. its a long read but the end is worth reading
19:09:47 <alex-resist> I switched from 4 digit PIN to long alphanumerical, but not many people will do that
19:10:13 <defconanon010102> This is relatively minor and is not necessarily a deal breaker. For an example you shouldn't be moving to Session if this was a deal breaker to you.
19:10:44 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "Adguard doesn't block as much as"> I was just reading this https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking - and I was considering changing my DNS. I am using a VPN app so I am using their DNS servers. Is it better to use custom ones rather than VPN ones? (i.e. is it generally better practice?)
19:11:03 <BalooRJ> Has anyone else noticed that GrapheneOS (and Android) have implemented Android to Android device native video calling?
19:11:10 <pikey[m]> <alex-resist "I switched from 4 digit PIN to l"> some people didn't even know you could do that ;-) !!
19:11:16 <alex-resist> The biggest deal-breaker is still that your phone number will be exposed in group chats, which is a no go in activist circles. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to bother too many people
19:11:22 <BalooRJ> I had someone from a Samsung phone who I know call me today through a video call which I had never used before
19:11:47 <pikey[m]> <alex-resist "The biggest deal-breaker is stil"> well believe me, it fucking bothers me. i have to run a burner phone just to use signal with people i don't wan to have my number
19:11:48 <BalooRJ> I didn't even know it was possible to make video calls through Android with a similar implementation like Facetime for iPhone, I thought Signal was the only way, or using some proprietary Google chat
19:11:51 <defconanon010102> <alex-resist "The biggest deal-breaker is stil"> Don't use Signal for group chats.
19:12:13 <BalooRJ> Anyone else know more about the native Android video chat between Android devices that works independently of Google Play services?
19:14:31 <f8sai[m]> <pikey[m] "I was just reading this https://"> It's alright tbh
19:15:01 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "It's alright tbh"> alright to stick with VPN ones?
19:15:17 <f8sai[m]> oops, alright to use other private dns I meant
19:15:26 <f8sai[m]> It helps block some ads and tracking
19:17:57 <pikey[m]> ok thanks. I'll run with advice on graphene site abobe
19:18:00 <pikey[m]>  * ok thanks. I'll run with advice on graphene site above
19:19:25 <alksjdasidjaosnc> thank you for NextDNS suggestion. I didn't know about it but i like the features :)
19:19:37 <BalooRJ> NextDNS is great. But it logs by default so if you're not comfortable with that turn logs off
19:19:58 <BalooRJ> There's also a max number of queries so if you're using it at the router level you may hit it if you're in a household with a lot of devices
19:20:22 <pikey[m]> does anyone know of any practical use for / reason to use SIgnal's "Registration Lock"?
19:21:04 <f8sai[m]> If you are willing to limit your contacts
19:21:27 <f8sai[m]> And lock registration on that SIM
19:21:37 <BalooRJ> It prevents the need for sim based 2FA
19:21:39 <pikey[m]> ?
19:21:49 <defconanon010102> Is NextDNS the best for users who like to go beyond per se? I wonder how much it minimizes ads.
19:21:56 <pikey[m]> limit contacts?
19:22:22 <defconanon010102> I heard of NextDNS before but I didn't know it also had Pihole.
19:22:25 <pikey[m]> ah i see. i would prefer sim based so i can probably turn it off then. thanks
19:22:44 <BalooRJ> defconanon010102 - I've been using it to block Facebook domains and its worked quite well, the list of blocklists it has are extremely extensive.
19:23:05 <BalooRJ> I haven't seen an ad with it on in quite some time using the PrivateDNS setting in GrapheneOS
19:23:33 <f8sai[m]> <pikey[m] "limit contacts?"> Like, on that sim, only them you'll contact. Anybody else on other sims to use on Signal.
19:24:58 <pikey[m]> just thinking about it. if i turn registration lock off, wouldn't it be possible for some bad actor to generate another sim with same phone number and register for my chats?
19:25:01 <defconanon010102> BalooRJ: Mind enlightening me on any limitations?
19:25:13 <pikey[m]> (say some evil doer can hack/make sim cards, or maybe a nasty cell company etc)
19:25:24 <BalooRJ> defconanon010102: Of NextDNS?
19:25:44 <BalooRJ> Like I said above, it defaults to logging your DNS queries, and after 300,000 queries in a month you have to pay for it.
19:25:45 <defconanon010102> BalooRJ: Yeah any that you noticed.
19:26:00 <defconanon010102> Oh I see.
19:26:28 <pikey[m]> <BalooRJ "Like I said above, it defaults t"> how would you turn off logging, on device or with an account at Next?
19:26:48 <BalooRJ> go to nextdns.io and simply to go to the logs panel
19:27:11 <BalooRJ> And then you can turn them off or tweak them to only last for a certain amount of time. Don't believe they keep logs indefinitely
19:27:40 <BalooRJ> to be honest, I think NextDNS should be supported as they're providing a very good service that can be tweaked at a very granular level, and is much better than a PiHole in the house because you can use it on your phone or laptop wherever you go
19:27:55 <pikey[m]> dumb question maybe, but if i am running a VPN app (which pushes DNS requyests to their own DNS servers), would that take priority over Private DNS settings in OS, or vice versa?
19:28:23 <BalooRJ> pikey: I believe it depends on where you are setting your DNS settings
19:29:15 <BalooRJ> so my NextDNS settings are at the program level, they have a native program for Linux distros which I use. I've noticed that even with a VPN sites that i've blocked still seem to be blocked. But I'll have to double check that
19:29:19 <pikey[m]> thanks. i always wonder "who wins" in situations like this!
19:30:00 <BalooRJ> Because I think Firefox allows you to set DNS settings as well, and then there's the ability to set it at the router level also. Not sure which takes priority, because I think it also depends on what level you're setting the VPN at
19:30:23 <BalooRJ> if the DNS is at the computer hardware level and the VPN is on the router, things are probably different than the other way around.
19:30:38 <pikey[m]> i guess, considering i have both "Always on VPN" turned on, as well as "Block connections outside VPN", theoretically no  connections should be allowed out of my Pixel other than to the VPN company, but whether the DNS request goes to them or goes through them to Adguard or not, thats teh question
19:31:33 <pikey[m]> I must find out about PiHole. I need some kind of personal VPN to connect to my home LAN from a second user profile on Pixel, to access CCTV which isn't connected to the WAN.  Christ, I am getting really jazzy with all these tech terms. bwaa haa
19:33:40 <alzxjm[m]> <BalooRJ "to be honest, I think NextDNS sh"> Is the NextDNS chrome extensions considered trustworthy?
19:35:15 <BalooRJ> I don't know, I don't use Chrome on desktop and don't use add-ons in Vanadium. Is that an official extension from the company?
19:35:29 <BalooRJ> For what it's worth, NextDNS is a California based company for anyone who is just interested in not using anything US based
19:35:53 <BalooRJ> it is open source on Github: https://github.com/nextdns/
19:36:54 <BalooRJ> I personally have not found any good alternatives that isn't a home-based PiHole.
19:38:08 <alzxjm[m]> I also have a PiHole at home. It's amazing. Maybe use that with NextDNS  on each client?
19:40:37 <defconanon010102> alzxjm: I would say refrain from using any extensions. I mean you go for the most popular ones for mitigation tactics but in the end you are making yourself more fingerprintable.
19:40:51 <defconanon010102> Could*
19:42:18 <alzxjm[m]> Yeah, I use as few as possible. Just the DDG extension and Bitwarden right now. I just checked and the NextDNS ChromeOS implementation is actually a Chrome Web App, not an extension.
19:42:47 <alzxjm[m]> defconanon010102: uBo became redundant for me with the pi-hole.
19:46:17 <pikey[m]> reading about this pihole thing. clever stuff. too clever for me sadly!
19:46:37 <defconanon010102> <alzxjm[m] "defconanon010102: uBo became red"> Would you say that Pi-hole is more manageable then NextDNS. Maybe I just don't like the cloud aspect.
19:47:17 <defconanon010102> Than*
19:55:22 <BalooRJ> If one doesn't like cloud based services, then your only options for privacy really are spinning up your own servers
19:56:57 <alksjdasidjaosnc> i just checked out NextDNS, and looking over the analytics section, seems it already figured out my cell ip and wifi ip address
19:57:29 <SchismXL[m]> <pikey[m] "reading about this pihole thing."> Pssh, @pikey:matrix.org. If you can install GOS, Pi-hole is a piece or cake.
19:58:56 <defconanon010102> BalooRJ: I just stick to local clients as much as possible. I would create my own VPS but my ISP hates that.
19:59:55 <BalooRJ> SchismXL: This is true...GrapheneOS install is not the most user friendly thing in the world, but once you get there it is smooth sailing. GrapheneOS is what encouraged me to use Linux as a full time desktop OS.
20:00:04 <pikey[m]> doubt that. don't assume i could install GOS, I did eventually yes, but with a TON of support and hand holding from JollyRoger, took DAYS. I just read the reddit and it's techie stuff, not for people who don't use CLI, not from what I read anyway. I am currently reading more of an idiot's guide though and I can see I probably colud manage it with a fair bit of learning and perserverance, but not sure it's worth that. I
20:00:04 <pikey[m]> also have a load of network stuff to sort out, new router, VPN etc, and I detest networking! IP conflicts etc. So yeah, it's probably not 'impossible' for me, but it won't be the "ten minutes" or whatever they claim, not for me anyway :D
20:00:06 <defconanon010102> Maybe it is just me but I found cloud based services pretty insecure when handling sensitive information.
20:01:29 <BalooRJ> defconanon010102: A fair argument, my next goal is to find a preconfigured Nextcloud box to host NextCloud, Collabera, and Jellyfin on for personal use
20:01:40 <BalooRJ> I don't do much cloud backups and stuff
20:02:45 <SchismXL[m]> <pikey[m] "doubt that. don't assume i could"> If you need a hand installing it at any point, hit me up. :)
20:03:52 <pikey[m]> that's very kind of you thanks. I may just do so one day
20:04:27 <defconanon010102> <pikey[m] "doubt that. don't assume i could"> Took longer for me not in your case though. What really screwed me up was downloading an older version of fastboot.
20:04:44 <BalooRJ> Yeah, that was what I was just about to say too
20:04:50 <BalooRJ> the Debian repository has an older version of fastboot in it
20:05:05 <pikey[m]> My current headache to work through is making CCTV system accessible over LAN without allowing incoming access from web, but allowing it outgoing access (via mac address filtering in new router i haven't been brave enough to install yet, its just sitting on my desk staring at me with a Clint Eastwood expression!)
20:05:12 <SchismXL[m]> <BalooRJ "defconanon010102: A fair argumen"> Hetzner, for the most part, is great. Apart from the lack of Collabora (at the moment). But, it wouldn't be too difficult to set up a cheap VPS ($5 a month thing) and install Collabora on there and then link it to the Hetzner instance.
20:05:15 <BalooRJ> And I had to learn how to install the newer version, that was tough. Think I ended up running the install from the fastboot folder on the desktop or something along those lines
20:05:46 <pikey[m]> I am sure I did that too, I don't there exists a mistake I didn't make :D. I think I shared about 20 screenshots and was copying and pasting commands from one machine to my linux machine set up just for the task. heh

20:05:54 <BalooRJ> SchismXL: What is Hetzner? Haven't heard of that one. I was looking to simply buy something like this on eBay: https://www.ebay.com/itm/254585279477?var=554315741873&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&fromMakeTrack=true

20:06:34 <pikey[m]> "pre-configured" - now they are sopeaking my language :D
20:06:37 <BalooRJ> When I installed GrapheneOS there wasn't even a demo video of it on Youtube.
20:06:44 <SchismXL[m]> <BalooRJ "SchismXL: What is Hetzner? Haven"> Hosting provider based in Germany. Been using their servers for years. They recently (last year sometime) made Nextcloud instances that cost a few dollars a month.
20:06:51 <pikey[m]> <defconanon010102 "Techlore tutorial really screwed"> ah yes. haha. i watched that and thought "i am sure that's not what I did!"
20:07:09 <BalooRJ> what does everyone in here use for desktop computers?
20:07:57 <BalooRJ> I use a laptop that I just installed Debian on with GRUB. Eventually I'd like to go the libreboot route but I'm not into the idea of Trisquel only being allowed to install completely free software, there are a couple of packages I'd like to have.
20:08:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hi BalooRJ, outside of the context of installation, desktop operating systems are currently an embargoed discussion here for the time being.

20:21:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! Matrix users, use the command `/join #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org` and that should take you right to it.
20:22:46 <pikey[m]> <SchismXL[m] "#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:m"> Perfect thank you. As fucking ALWAYS, "why didn't I just do what JR said?" hehe. sorted. JR you have been a diamond, I am now running two Pixels and hoping to get a few friends set up on it. Hopefully I won't need to bug you again in here but it's been a sincere pleasure shipmate :D
20:23:17 <defconanon010102> pikey: Up to you Pikey if you want to join Spite. It is privacy and security oriented type of chat.

20:24:58 <pikey[m]> click this https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
20:25:14 <TheJollyRoger> EssentialChaos[m: you'll need to erase the backticks or -- ha, nice work pikey[m].
20:25:31 <pikey[m]> :). finally, i have a use! cheers all. out
20:27:40 <alzxjm[m]> Hmm
20:27:41 <EssentialChaos[m> alzxjm: Same for me
20:27:41 * alzxjm[m] uploaded an image: image.png (57KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/HuoeyGmkWUUCTBcUthhqzDXy >
20:27:41 <EssentialChaos[m> Maybe because we are not using matrix.org as a homeserver?
20:28:55 <defconanon010102> I would guess that not sure what would be the workaround probably an invite would suffice.
20:29:00 <BalooRJ> Curious to know for all matrix users on here
20:29:18 <BalooRJ> any reason why you are using Matrix as basically a bridge for Freenode IRC? There are some great FLOSS IRC clients out there for anyone interested in connecting to the other room
20:30:01 <pikey[m]> <BalooRJ "any reason why you are using Mat"> i guess for those (like me) who have Riot installed just for Graphene OS room, it saves installing yet another ap

20:30:03 <pikey[m]>  * i guess for those (like me) who have Riot installed just for Graphene OS room, it saves installing yet another app
20:30:16 <g65434-2[m]> it's the only "social media" i trust
20:30:25 <g65434-2[m]> and so i can talk to some people instead of being alone
20:30:35 <BalooRJ> pikey: Makes sense from that angle.
20:30:47 <dazinism> IRC doesnt work well on mobile
20:31:05 <pikey[m]> <g65434-2[m] "it's the only "social media" i t"> yuk, I can't believe you just called it that!
20:31:15 <BalooRJ> Also true, I've only gotten one F-Droid app to work in IRC and even then it's not great
20:31:41 <g65434-2[m]> idk how to call it lol
20:31:53 <g65434-2[m]> "collaborative messenger" something like that
20:31:57 <cdesai> dazinism: I use quassel, works very well on mobile.
20:32:10 <dazinism> Unless, maybe, you got another client set up somewhere
20:32:38 <dazinism> Like cdesai 😃
20:35:37 <dazinism> Need a box somewhere, pref with constant internet connection, that the android client can connect to.
20:36:40 <cdesai> a server basically. there's irccloud as well
20:42:31 <alzxjm[m]> So do I need to find a different IRC client to join the grapheneos-offtopic room?
20:43:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why not have it bridge to matrix
20:46:25 <TheJollyRoger> I'll be back in a bit, sorry. Running behind atm.
20:46:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try to get it fixed asap.
21:00:13 <javashin> hello
21:00:51 <javashin> im looking a way to compile a CAF rom For My Device And Im Thinking Of Choose GrapheneOS
21:01:25 <helptechboomer[m> hey I followed the techlore install guide, it didn't work and now I have a phone with no OS and abd fastboot doesn't seem to recognize my device any recommendations?
21:01:55 <javashin> i already have a kernel with security in mind that i compile patching the kernel with AndroidHardened patches
21:02:14 <javashin> From GrapheneOS Repo On Github branch 4.14
21:02:19 <javashin> lts
21:02:31 <g65434-2[m]> <helptechboomer[m "hey I followed the techlore inst"> why are you following a random guide when there is an official one ?
21:02:53 <helptechboomer[m> because video guides are usually easier when I have no idea what I'm doing
21:03:05 <javashin> so i have a Moto G7 Power = Ocean and there is vendor and device tree's
21:03:19 <javashin> whats the process to compile grapheneOS
21:03:29 <javashin> is the source big ?
21:03:36 <sphinxpy[m]> <helptechboomer[m "because video guides are usually"> When you boot, does it boot into bootloader?
21:03:49 <javashin> can i use debian unstable sid to compile this OS
21:04:50 <javashin> and if is there a way to repo sync fetch all the git repos projects that needs the rom with --depht=1 to download all the sources faster as possible without any history
21:05:14 <javashin> my internet connection is very slow also im running out of space
21:05:20 <helptechboomer[m> <sphinxpy[m] "When you boot, does it boot into"> When I press the power button it shows "Can't find operating system. The device will not start." It also shows a big red exclaimation mark with a triangle and it tells me to visit some google link. Is that the bootloader?
21:05:27 <javashin> thanks in advance
21:07:00 <JTL> javashin: I tested awhile ago and there is a way to clone all repositories with clone depth of 1
21:08:11 <javashin> yes
21:08:21 <javashin> ok that would be great
21:08:31 <javashin> because i dont have 200Gigas around
21:08:41 <JTL> Can't help at the moment because busy but it's doable
21:08:49 <javashin> kk
21:08:52 <javashin> np
21:08:59 <JTL> Also I'm not sure how much space the repos+build output take even with a clone depth of 1
21:09:11 <javashin> if there is way i think i can look around
21:09:17 <JTL> at the source?
21:09:25 <javashin> not source
21:09:40 <javashin> in the repo program
21:09:49 <javashin> repo calls git
21:10:11 <javashin> so maybe i can replace that git call and make an alias or something to do depth=1
21:10:36 <javashin> but normally how grapheneOs is compiled ?
21:10:43 <javashin> like any other rom ?
21:25:20 <dazinism> helptechboomer: you should be able to get into the bootloader again with power and volume down.
21:25:51 <dazinism> Follow the install guide from GrapheneOS.org
21:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> adb reboot bootloader
21:37:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> javashin: don't shallow sync ideally
21:37:36 <JTL> anupritaisno1[m]: yeah, for development I think history is kinda needed :P
21:37:38 <javashin> no ?
21:37:53 <javashin> well i just want to build for 1st time
21:44:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> JTL: no
21:45:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is because repo syncs its own manifest with that
21:45:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sometimes just to get a clean pull you'll have to resync everything
22:25:16 <javashin> i see
22:25:56 <javashin> any grapheneOS device with kernel 4.9 ?
22:26:43 <javashin> i need the commits that apply clean to that kernel version because there are lots of conflicts when i try to merge from 4.14-lts branch
22:32:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> What are you trying to do?
22:47:12 <javashin> merge the patches of AndroidHardened Into My Kernel
22:47:43 <javashin> android linux kernel 4.9.230 msm-4.9 caf branch -r27
22:47:59 <javashin> based on motorola Q stock kernel with modules inline
