00:09:07 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: no need to include default config changes
00:11:06 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: no need to include de"> Ok, got rid of them
00:31:28 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: main thing that needs to be done is debugging the slab canary issue that's blocking re-enabling it
00:31:45 <strcat[m]> can't remember when the issue was introduced
00:50:40 <madaidan[m]> The ASLR commits above are all of them though, right?
00:53:37 <strcat[m]> maybe?
00:53:42 <strcat[m]> I didn't quite finish on arm64 btw
00:53:42 <strcat[m]> before
00:53:53 <strcat[m]> and also there's the 4 level page table bug that needs to be resolved (see os_issue_tracker)
01:37:53 <DDD2232> I am getting a bunch of errors installing OS on pixel 3 XL.
01:38:04 <DDD2232> Does anyone have few min to help me out with this?
01:42:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hi DDD2232 your timing's good, I just sat down.
01:42:35 <DDD2232> Awesome!
01:42:54 <TheJollyRoger> Alright -- where are you right now and are you installing using the official guide? Have you read the official guide start-to-end?
01:43:01 <DDD2232> I have
01:43:04 <DDD2232> I downloaded image
01:43:08 <DDD2232> Doing flash-all
01:43:16 <DDD2232> I did flash-all previously on regular factory images
01:43:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, what do you see in the scrollback?
01:43:28 <DDD2232> So I am somwhat familiar with the process.
01:43:31 <DDD2232> well first
01:43:41 <DDD2232> fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html
01:43:49 <DDD2232> But I have the newest verssion
01:43:55 <TheJollyRoger> can you run for me:
01:44:02 <TheJollyRoger> which fastboot ; fastboot --version
01:44:05 <TheJollyRoger> and let me see the result?
01:44:23 <DDD2232> fastboot version eac51f2bb6a8-android
01:45:08 <DDD2232> platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows
01:45:14 <DDD2232> is what I downloaded and installed
01:45:27 <TheJollyRoger> You're on Windows?
01:45:28 <TheJollyRoger> Ok.
01:45:30 <DDD2232> I can edit bath file to ignore the error. But then I have next one and next one
01:45:31 <DDD2232> yes
01:45:49 <TheJollyRoger> Don't, unless you want to get the dreaded "No OS found" error.
01:46:07 <DDD2232> I generally got to
01:46:07 <DDD2232> Erase successful, but not automatically formatting.
01:46:15 <DDD2232> I can still boot into OS
01:46:20 <DDD2232> but regular google OS
01:46:32 <DDD2232> Cant install Graphene
01:46:41 <TheJollyRoger> For some reason even though you did download platform tools, your command path is still set to prefer the incorrect version of fastboot.
01:47:02 <DDD2232> path is set to the same adb folder/
01:47:05 <DDD2232> Same one I am using
01:47:20 <TheJollyRoger> Then it should be returning 30.0
01:47:47 <TheJollyRoger> I'd suggest removing fastboot and making sure that it's fully removed and starting over again with unpacking fastboot and adding it to your path.
01:48:24 <DDD2232> ok one sec
01:48:51 <TheJollyRoger> If fastboot --version doesn't return 30.0- then something is wrong.
01:49:43 <TheJollyRoger> It should do this even on Windows - that sanity check was added because people kept flashing using incorrect or outdated versions of fastboot or "Minimal Fastboot" versions distributed for Windows, and ending up with the "No OS found" error.
01:50:40 <DDD2232> Ok, but putting this error aside, if I downloaded the newest one, and I am running a newest one by opening CMD window in that specific folder...
01:50:56 <DDD2232> Shouldn't I be able to manually skip this?
01:51:09 <TheJollyRoger> You should be using Powershell, not cmd.
01:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> Until you get fastboot --version to return the correct version, don't continue.
01:52:53 <TheJollyRoger> It looks like you've installed one of those "minimal fastboot" versions and your command path is preferring that over 30.
01:53:22 <DDD2232> hmmm
01:53:46 <DDD2232> ok let me check
01:54:21 <TheJollyRoger> So the thing you will need to do first is to remove all traces of the old fastboot from your system, because these "minimal fastboot" versions packaged for Windows often don't support autodetection and then your phone won't boot from the correct partition.
01:54:40 <TheJollyRoger> So it keeps trying to boot from the Google partition.
01:54:53 <DDD2232> Ok got you. SHould I install full SDK?
01:55:07 <TheJollyRoger> You won't need to. Simply download the official platform tools latest from google.
01:55:58 <TheJollyRoger> You will need to then add it to your command path.
01:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> Also - please be sure to read the installation guide fully, you will need to use Powershell for this, not cmd.
01:57:32 <DDD2232> I read that just tend to name them interchangeably. Just an old habit. But I have been opening PS and going to the appropriate adb folder.
01:57:54 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "I didn't quite finish on arm64 b"> What else is there to be done?
01:58:09 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Be sure to add it to your command path, since flash-all will need to call fastboot multiple times.
01:58:39 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: making it preserve ASLR entropy under memory exhaustion iirc
01:58:39 <strcat[m]> I forget
01:58:41 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, make sure you run "fastboot --version" and check that it returns the correct version.
02:00:41 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: making it preserve AS"> Isn't that part of GRKERNSEC_PROC_MEMMAP?
02:00:55 <DDD2232> fastboot version 30.0.2-6538114
02:00:58 <DDD2232> I got it
02:01:06 <TheJollyRoger> Great!
02:01:54 <madaidan[m]> Are issues 43 and 101 the same?
02:02:19 <madaidan[m]> Submitted the ASLR enhancements btw
02:03:48 <DDD2232> TheJollyRoger tried flash-all it is giving me some stupid Cant read the file error. Letm e redownload
02:15:05 <DDD2232> Ok I got further than before
02:15:08 <DDD2232> Resizing 'product_b'                               OKAY [  0.010s]
02:15:31 <DDD2232> It happens too fast. I try to reboot to bootloader on the device but the scripts stops way before I can get to i.t
02:15:35 <DDD2232> it*
02:15:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hold on. What are you doing...?
02:16:24 <DDD2232> flash-all
02:16:30 <TheJollyRoger> The script should be allowed to run to completion...
02:16:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> In case fastboot flashing or flash all is too difficult
02:16:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Flash boot.img and the avb key, reboot recovery and sideload the full OTA
02:17:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: will guide you :D
02:17:25 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
02:17:32 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: I'll take notes for this part then!
02:17:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll pm those
02:17:47 <DDD2232> Ok I guess I did not understand that part. Webpage guide says to select reboot to bootloader on the device on Pixel 3 XL.
02:18:15 <TheJollyRoger> DDD2232: let it run to completion first. It will eventually pause at fastbootd - note the d.
02:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> Your device will restart on its own several times, let it.
02:19:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7-pro/development/9-glassrom-t3987291
02:19:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's how I tell my users to do it
02:19:33 <DDD2232> and my script stopped mid way saying
02:19:34 <DDD2232> Resizing 'system_b'                                OKAY [  0.009s]
02:19:54 <DDD2232> but I ran it again, and it seems it went through. I have OS boot screen now.
02:20:28 <DDD2232> anupritaisno1[m] I was thinking of that being my next step. Always had more luck than with flash-all images.
02:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: oh fantastic, I'll go and take a look.
02:20:39 <DDD2232> But it seems it went through. Give me few min
02:21:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sadly there's no bootable-only image for graphene but you can just flash the boot.img and recovery.img if it exists to make up for that TheJollyRoger
02:21:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> And yes A/B devices can ship a recovery partition now
02:21:34 <TheJollyRoger> Huh, wow.
02:22:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> It uses the same update mechanism
02:22:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Add recovery to AB_OTA_PARTITIONS
02:22:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> The build system tries to generate a patch for it, probably a Q bug but doesn't include an install-recovery.sh
02:24:06 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m], sometime I'll have to read more about GlassROM!
02:24:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is just grapheneos
02:24:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> But supports devices which graphene can't without needing significant modifications
02:25:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is why it doesn't exist on pixel though it does get tested against it
02:25:28 <TheJollyRoger> Oh fantastic.
02:25:31 <TheJollyRoger> That's pretty awesome.
02:27:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remember that glassrom does not have the hardened malloc "mitigations"
02:27:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I haven't had any reports of anything outside pixel having audio issues
02:28:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> There were issues with front/back camera in the beginning but then an OEM vendor blob update fixed those so that mitigation isn't needed either
02:28:31 <TheJollyRoger> Oh huh.
02:28:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tl;dr the hardened malloc on glassrom might break stuff on pixels
02:28:46 <DDD2232> TheJollyRoger and anupritaisno1. I am in. Everything seemed to be doing fine. Thank you immensly!
02:29:26 <TheJollyRoger> DDD2232: yarr, splice the mainbrace!
02:29:31 <TheJollyRoger> Welcome aboard the ship!
02:29:41 <DDD2232> haha : ))
02:33:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: BTW you got a pixel 3?
02:33:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or 3xl
03:07:27 <TheJollyRoger> Hi anupritaisno1[m], mine is the ordinary Vanilla 3.
03:07:37 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops, sorry about the delay.
03:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> In retrospect I am sort of regretting not getting a bigger screen but I think next time I will fix that.
03:17:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi anupritaisno1, mine is the or"> Can you test that pull request?
03:17:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_crosshatch/pull/3
03:17:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> I want to go revision by revision and make sure there is no breakage
03:22:25 <TheJollyRoger> Lemme take a look...
03:23:15 <TheJollyRoger> Just build with this...?
03:25:51 <TheJollyRoger> Just getting set up right now!
03:32:34 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: I will need some help in figuring out how to merge this and add it to my build tree, I'm just getting stuff synced right now...
03:36:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Build
03:36:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> And for this one just make sure USB connection is good
03:36:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "anupritaisno1: I will need some "> git pull
03:37:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll cleanly merge
03:38:49 <TheJollyRoger-M> One sec. Think my home internet connection just barfed.
03:39:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> There won't even be a merge commit created
03:39:29 <TheJollyRoger-M> Downloading and syncing right now, Im just going to back up what apps I can on my phone.
03:40:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> git pull https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/kernel_google_crosshatch

03:41:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> JollyRoger: take your time
03:41:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> I want to get this done at least for crosshatch before the July security patch
03:42:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Preferably for all the devices
03:42:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> But at least crosshatch
03:46:19 <TheJollyRoger-M> Okay!
03:55:32 <TheJollyRoger> You know that things are going insane when ssh to screen chokes from lack of bandwidth... crap on a cracker I need to get better Internet.
04:02:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW here's the update for the optimized browser stuff https://transfer.sh/gA2Q8/ChromePublic.apk
04:02:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pixel 3 and 4 only
04:03:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Contains my shadow call stack patch too which I sent to daniel
04:07:15 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! I'm downloading it all now.
04:08:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW
04:08:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> You don't need to build everything
04:09:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Build kernel + m bootimage
04:09:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then fastboot boot boot.img
04:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I will need to unlock bootloader though and all, right?
04:10:45 <TheJollyRoger> Shoot. I got a problem here, repo's not syncing. Give me a moment to sort this out.
04:12:10 <mmcblk0[m]> The both are you juste kiding from users?🤔
04:57:07 <TheJollyRoger> OK there we go!
04:57:14 * TheJollyRoger beats the computer with a wrench.
05:00:49 <TheJollyRoger> Just trying to clone the stuff now.
05:15:20 <brenneke[m]1> Do I need to be concerned with wiping free space on GrapheneOS phone after sensitive files deleted?
05:27:42 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]1: I don't think so. The files are encrypted with different keys.
05:35:12 <cn3m[m]> brenneke: if you have to turn over your device unlocked sure, but you would be much better off with multiple profiles
05:35:41 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: Sorry about the delay, I'm really having trouble applying the patch. I'm trying to browse git help.

06:40:32 <brenneke[m]1> <cn3m[m] "Install diskdigger and run that "> Does seem like a long way around, why not use an app that wipes free space right off the hop?

09:00:13 <cn3m[m]> Welcome
09:10:48 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 is replacing the Files app. Hopefully the AOSP one doesn't break down
09:12:48 <jalb66> cn3m[m], which app is now?
09:52:52 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "Android 11 is replacing the File"> Surpised they'll replaced that app
13:23:54 <blacklight447[m]> Question, would this fix the issue that all apps can list all apps installed on your phone:https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/package-visibility
13:34:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> big if true
14:16:03 <generateduser392> similar to sandboxing?
14:16:20 <generateduser392> but still not as good compared to apple?
14:23:51 <blacklight447[m]> It seems like an app needs to list the specific apps it needs to be able to see on install time
14:27:46 <overheadscallop[> they can also define file types to get a list of apps that handle them
14:42:07 <cdesai> blacklight447[m]: yes, but the thing to note here, as with most of these features - is that they're only for apps targetting api 30
14:53:24 <blacklight447[m]> I am aware, but it has to start somewhere right
14:54:30 <dazinism> blacklight447: it doesnt help much
14:55:47 <cdesai> it would make things better after a few releases, when due to play store policies most apps would've updated their target api :)
14:57:03 <dazinism> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fpc2av/apps_are_meant_to_be_able_to_enumerate_other_apps/
15:09:24 <blacklight447[m]> <dazinism "https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> This is two months ago though
15:09:28 <blacklight447[m]> Maybe there is more to this
15:09:45 <blacklight447[m]> I mean if its litterly pointless then google normally wouldn't go thru the effort of making it
15:14:06 <dazinism> blacklight447: pretty sure its still valid. Think if an app makes itself available for interactions, then other apps can detect it.
15:18:54 <blacklight447[m]> We will have to see what it entails
15:19:49 <blacklight447[m]> Then again, buildings arent build at once, they are build brick by brick
15:20:15 <blacklight447[m]> If this doesn't block all ways, its atleast a start
15:31:07 <dazinism> blacklight447: its linked from the reddit post, but this and the following comments explain more about how the design of how apps interact in android make implementing something that achieves this very difficult
15:31:12 <dazinism> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/149#issuecomment-553580613
15:32:45 <dazinism> Think the 'easy' option is to make using multiple profiles better.
15:33:41 <dazinism> Which i guess would be to enable ways to share data across profiles
15:34:30 <dazinism> Also maybe a switch to shut down a profile
15:35:00 <dazinism> I mean user profiles
15:35:51 <dazinism> Would also be good to be able to let user profiles share UI (like with the work profile)
15:39:57 <madaidan[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Question, would this fix the iss"> Yes, as long as the app uses a fine-grained intent filter and doesn't have the QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permissions.
15:40:21 <madaidan[m]> <dazinism "blacklight447: pretty sure its s"> That's exactly what it prevents.
15:41:12 <madaidan[m]> It restricts IPC between apps so they can't communicate as much, which should prevent enumerating apps.
15:41:33 <madaidan[m]> It requires the app uses the intent filter properly of course.
15:44:16 <madaidan[m]> <madaidan[m] "Yes, as long as the app uses a f"> Oh and the app needs to use scoped storage.
15:54:27 <blacklight447[m]> <madaidan[m] "Oh and the app needs to use scop"> Thats required by api 30 right?
15:56:39 <dazinism> blacklight447: for any app thats a new install
16:00:30 <dazinism> madaidan.: IIUC apps will have to declare what they want to interact with.
16:00:41 <dazinism> So it doesnt help if an app developer wants to try and detect apps, although you could get an idea of that by checking the apps manifest
16:03:52 <blacklight447[m]> <dazinism "madaidan.: IIUC apps will have t"> Isnt this a bit the same as in openbsd pledge?
16:04:07 <blacklight447[m]> Declare what they access , but they cannot alter it afterwards
16:05:10 <dazinism> Also in the github issue I linked just above, strcat gives the impression theres likely other system APIs that could be used.
16:06:34 <dazinism> blacklight447: sounds like it, don't know if theres anything to stop this being changed with an app update?
16:31:01 <overheadscallop[> it won't work on graphene
16:31:08 <jiibus[m]> Hello! Would installing Aurora Services via ADB [like their instructions say](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraServices#installation) mess things up in Graphene?
16:31:18 <jiibus[m]> Kinda thought that would be the case. Oh well
16:31:46 <jiibus[m]> Manually updating every app it is!
16:37:46 <blacklight447[m]> Atleast the download is done automatically
16:39:24 <yekip[m]> I have a pretty huge music library in iTunes (spit!) which I would like (if poss) to migrate over to Graphene somehow. No idea where to start so before i look into how, i thought I would just check if it's even possible to retain playlists etc? I am on a mac, so thinking of using android file transfer app and hoping drag and drop will work to at least dump it all over, but if playlists could be retained that would pretty
16:39:24 <yekip[m]> nice
17:14:05 <meltedcheddar[m]> Do you have problems with RiotX notifications? Any way to fix it?
17:17:42 <dazinism> jiibus: automatic app updates will come with the GrapheneOS app store. Initially will just be system apps - vanadium, PDF viewer, auditor
17:18:23 <dazinism> Then a curated set of apps that supply common functionality
17:18:25 <meltedcheddar[m]> <dazinism "jiibus: automatic app updates wi"> Graphene app store? What a drem
17:18:34 <meltedcheddar[m]> Dream
17:21:58 <dazinism> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/94
17:25:08 <jiibus[m]> That's great to hear! Looking forward to it. Any idea when it will actually be implemented?
17:57:12 <jcpicard32[m]> It really depends. More people contributing will obviously make progress faster. As it is now it's something nice to work on when higher priority work is done for Daniel and the current contributors
18:44:54 <yekip[m]> anyone know if its possible to transfer music from itunes to graphene and keep playlists?
20:03:38 <jiibus[m]> You try [this](https://www.app.com/story/money/industries/technology/2016/06/06/itune-android-sync/84996824/#:~:text=To%20import%20your%20iTunes%20playlists,you're%20good%20to%20go.)?
20:37:36 <radixed9[m]> <jiibus[m] "That's great to hear! Looking fo"> I am working on improving the updater app and laying the foundation for an app store. Sadly, I haven't been able to work on it for a few days. The goal is to get Vanadium, Auditor, and PDF Viewer rolling out without having to have a full release.
20:56:57 <greenmoon[m]> Cool but one more store app? 3 stores app on the phone isnt a bit too much?
21:11:19 <radixed9[m]> Third party apps stores aren't an ideal solution. Neither F-Droid or Aurora are robust or secure enough to turn into a first party app store
21:30:29 <ch878787> hi
21:30:36 <ch878787> I am a noob
21:30:40 <ch878787> I need help
21:31:00 <ch878787> Trying to instal graphene OS on Pixel device.
21:31:10 <ch878787> I get the following error message
21:31:11 <ch878787> fastboot : The term 'fastboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

21:32:37 <hitchhooker[m]> fastboot version 30.0.0-2
21:33:02 <ch878787> I am a noob
21:33:31 <ch878787> can you please walk me through the steps? My bootloader is unlocked already
21:33:54 <ch878787> I followed grapeheen install but still it is saying old fastboot version and giving that error
21:34:58 <ch878787> please
21:35:43 <TheJollyRoger> Hi ch878787,
21:35:53 <ch878787> hi
21:36:09 <TheJollyRoger> Can you run "fastboot --version" and tell me what you get, as well as your desktop operating system, please?
21:36:16 <ch878787> ok
21:36:38 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to be on Version 10 if you are running Windows.
21:37:10 <ch878787> do i do that from command prompt?
21:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yes -- if you are getting the error message "fastboot too old" then STOP right there.
21:38:08 <TheJollyRoger> The reason that sanity check is there is for your protection so you don't softbrick your device with a butchered version of fastboot that won't support autodetection.
21:38:30 <TheJollyRoger> You will need to use Powershell, not cmd.
21:38:44 <ch878787> ok I am new to this but I will try ok
21:38:47 <ch878787> one sec
21:38:50 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
21:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> If you installed a "Minimal fastboot" or anything but https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools this, uninstall it.
21:39:46 <TheJollyRoger> You will need the official Fastboot from Google.
21:40:13 <ch878787> fastboot : The term 'fastboot' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
21:40:14 <ch878787> CommandNotFoundException
21:40:24 <ch878787> I go t that message
21:40:46 <TheJollyRoger> OK, great - that's actually a good sign because it shows you haven't installed a bad version. Go and get the .zip fastboot from Google.
21:41:08 <ch878787> can you send the link
21:41:14 <ch878787> just so I do everything smoothly
21:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> Just did, scroll up to "If you installed a Minimal fastboot"
21:41:37 <ch878787> oh ok thanks
21:41:47 <TheJollyRoger> Be sure to get platform-tools latest.
21:42:13 <ch878787> So I will click: Download SDK Platform-Tools for Windows
21:42:19 <ch878787> ?
21:42:29 <ch878787> ok
21:42:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment, because I have no browser at this time.
21:42:37 <ch878787> ok
21:42:49 <TheJollyRoger> You can either wait until I'm back at my station, or you can search download the standalone platform tools.
21:42:59 <ch878787> I will wait :)
21:43:33 <TheJollyRoger> While you do, read everything in the Installation guide - read it twice.
21:44:36 <ch878787> the grapehene  os guide
21:44:37 <ch878787> ?
21:44:53 <TheJollyRoger> Fortunately, I've memorized this url:
21:45:00 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/install
21:45:55 <ch878787> lol
21:46:33 <ch878787> i will still need your help ebcause I have used this guide and I get the same issues (old fastboot) and error message
21:47:05 <ch878787> at present, my bootloader is unlocked, my google security patches are up to date
21:47:34 <ch878787> so lets start from there
21:47:36 <ch878787> please
21:47:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Do you have the latest standalone platform tools?
21:48:05 <ch878787> umm I will try and do that now
21:48:10 <ch878787> what is the latests version?
21:48:14 <TheJollyRoger> Unzip the zip file and you should see "adb"  and "fastboot" inside platform-tools
21:48:21 <TheJollyRoger> It should say latest, the number is 30.0.2.
21:48:42 <ch878787> ok I WILL
21:48:59 <ch878787> thanks I will do that
21:49:20 <TheJollyRoger> This is going to be important - take note of where you unzip it to.
21:49:40 <ch878787> ok
21:49:49 <TheJollyRoger> If you are on Windows I suggest you unzip it to C:\Users\[yourname]\Applications\>
21:49:58 <TheJollyRoger> Replacing "[yourname]" with your username of course.
21:50:33 <TheJollyRoger> This should leave you with a single folder in there called C:\Users\[yourname]\Applications\platform-tools\> in which you should see "adb" and "fastboot" executables.
21:51:35 <ch878787> I got it
21:51:41 <ch878787> i did it
21:51:56 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. In powershell I want you to do a quick sanity check for me since I'm not there and not looking over your shoulder
21:52:01 <ch878787> ok
21:52:04 <TheJollyRoger> run the following command:
21:52:07 <ch878787> ok
21:52:22 <TheJollyRoger> dir %HOMEDIR%\Applications\platform-tools\fastboot*
21:52:54 <ch878787> by the way I saved the extracted platform tools files in the downloads folder
21:53:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, so tell me what this command returns:
21:53:22 <ch878787> I got the same errror message
21:53:23 <ch878787> dir : Cannot find path 'C:\Users\dell\%HOMEDIR%\Applications\platform-tools' because it does not exist.
21:53:23 <ch878787> Exception
21:53:38 <TheJollyRoger> dir %HOMEDIR%\Applications\platform-tools\
21:53:42 <TheJollyRoger> Argh fuck
21:53:46 <TheJollyRoger> belay that
21:53:52 <ch878787> hmm?
21:53:53 <TheJollyRoger> dir %HOMEDIR\Downloads\platform-tools
21:53:57 <TheJollyRoger> That one.
21:54:06 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry, bit distracted.
21:54:50 <ch878787> dir : Cannot find path 'C:\Users\dell\%HOMEDIR\Downloads\platform-tools' because it does not exist.
21:54:50 <ch878787> FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand
21:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Where did you unzip it to?
21:55:32 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, wait, sorry, I made another typo:
21:55:37 <ch878787> ok
21:55:38 <TheJollyRoger> dir %HOMEDIR%\Downloads\platform-tools
21:55:43 <TheJollyRoger> I missed the closing % sign
21:55:44 <TheJollyRoger> My bad
21:56:05 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, this is a quick sanity check because I can't actually see your computer from where I sit.
21:56:14 <ch878787> same errror message
21:56:27 <ch878787> i unzipped it to downloads folder
21:56:44 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, can you tell me the path of fastboot?
21:56:54 <ch878787> umm
21:57:39 <ch878787> do you mean how to locate the fastboot.exe file?
21:58:07 <ch878787> if so
21:58:09 <ch878787> C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows (1)\platform-tools
21:58:53 <TheJollyRoger> ok. cd to that directory.
21:59:07 <ch878787> how
21:59:25 <TheJollyRoger> cd C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows
21:59:31 <TheJollyRoger> (if what you've told me is correct)
21:59:40 <ch878787> do I type that in powershell
21:59:41 <ch878787> ?
22:00:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. It should change the working directory shown at the prompt. You can check its contents with the "dir" command to make sure you ended up in the right location.
22:00:36 <ch878787> same error message came up
22:00:55 <ch878787> do I have to do a add path enviroment variable thing?
22:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> No, right now we need to find out where fastboot.exe is unzipped to.
22:01:56 <ch878787> C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows (1)\platform-tools
22:02:10 <ch878787> that is where
22:02:25 <TheJollyRoger> ok, but, how come you're getting an error message when you'er trying to change your directory to that location?
22:02:49 <ch878787> i dont know I am a noob
22:03:19 <ch878787> should I delete everything and start again
22:03:44 <ch878787> or did you accidentally do a type again
22:03:49 <TheJollyRoger> No. hold on a sec.
22:04:05 <TheJollyRoger> I think I see what the issue is --
22:04:13 <ch878787> okk
22:04:24 <TheJollyRoger> tar Cxvf C:
22:04:27 <TheJollyRoger> Belay that.
22:04:37 <TheJollyRoger> Hit enter prematurely
22:04:58 <ch878787> I should copy and paste that in powershell and hit enter
22:04:59 <ch878787> ?
22:05:09 <TheJollyRoger> tar xvf C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows.zip
22:05:13 <TheJollyRoger> This one.
22:05:25 <TheJollyRoger> Not the one above, this one. Into powershell
22:05:33 <ch878787> omg
22:05:35 <TheJollyRoger> Looks like powershell for some reason hid the filename extension
22:05:47 <TheJollyRoger> So that confused me.
22:05:51 <ch878787> a whole load of listing happend
22:05:55 <ch878787> in powershell
22:05:58 <ch878787> now it stopped
22:06:02 <TheJollyRoger> ok now can you do:
22:06:22 <TheJollyRoger> cd C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools ; ls
22:06:46 <TheJollyRoger> see if "fastboot" is there.
22:07:03 <TheJollyRoger> This should change the directory to platform-tools and list the contents
22:07:53 <ch878787> yes a list of contents is there under the same red  error message but no fastboot
22:08:03 <TheJollyRoger> Paste what you see.
22:08:07 <TheJollyRoger> Remember I'm not there.
22:08:09 <TheJollyRoger> I can't see.
22:08:12 <TheJollyRoger> I'm flying blind.

22:09:12 <ch878787> oundException
22:10:08 <TheJollyRoger> cd to Downloads and see if a "platform-tools" folder is there.
22:10:40 <ch878787> i dont understand sorry
22:10:45 <ch878787> what do i do?
22:11:08 <TheJollyRoger> I'm trying to get enough information to get a bigger picture but you're not giving me enough information so I have to guess.
22:11:25 <ch878787> ok but like how do i cd to downloads
22:12:27 <TheJollyRoger> you need to find out where you downloaded platform tools to and use the "cd" command in powershell to change your directory to it.
22:12:44 <TheJollyRoger> You can move up a directory with "cd .." or into a directory by typing in its name after cd
22:12:58 <TheJollyRoger> If it has a space in it, in Powershell you must enclose the name in quotes.
22:14:54 <TheJollyRoger> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools Please review this.
22:14:58 <ch878787> I think i did it
22:14:59 <TheJollyRoger> These steps are exact.
22:15:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Is the command "dir fastboot*" returning fastboot?
22:16:24 <ch878787> ok so here is what i did
22:16:26 <ch878787> cd C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows (1)\platform-tools
22:16:45 <ch878787> i typed that in powershell as it is the exact same path to the unzipped platform tools folder
22:16:46 <ch878787> then
22:16:58 <ch878787> i got
22:17:00 <ch878787> PS C:\Users\dell> cd C:\Users\dell\Downloads\platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows (1)\platform-tools
22:17:01 <ch878787> CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [Set-Location], ParameterBindingException
22:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah that's incorrect - you're giving it two separate arguments and telling it to cd to two different locations, one of which is a zipfile and the other doesn't exist yet.
22:17:40 <ch878787> ohhhh
22:18:02 <TheJollyRoger> This is why I need to see the whole scrollback otherwise I'm just guessing.
22:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, I'm not sitting next to you.
22:18:13 <ch878787> ok
22:18:18 <ch878787> i know
22:18:35 <ch878787> i did what projectserv said and i got /msg : The term '/msg' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path
22:18:35 <ch878787> (/msg:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
22:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> "/msg" is to private message someone on IRC in your client. Why are you typing it into powershell?
22:19:35 <ch878787> i got confused man its my first time using this thing... I got directed to it by daniel mccay
22:19:44 <ch878787> himself after i emailed him
22:20:55 <TheJollyRoger> Were you trying to message me?
22:21:02 <TheJollyRoger> :P.
22:21:13 <TheJollyRoger> I understand that the commandline can be a bit daunting... we'll work it out together.
22:21:25 <ch878787> ok
22:21:48 <TheJollyRoger> So, do you know where the platform-tools directory is, and can you cd to it? Locate it in Windows Explorer first if you're having trouble or need a hint.
22:21:52 <ch878787> ok so I typed cd and then the platform tools folder and it showed the following
22:22:16 <ch878787> after i hit enter
22:22:17 <ch878787> PS C:\Users\dell\platform-tools>
22:22:46 <ch878787> is that good?
22:23:25 <TheJollyRoger> we're about to find out. Type in "dir" and paste the result.
22:23:31 <ch878787> ok
22:23:49 <ch878787> Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

22:24:17 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to start numbering commands, so we can keep track of things.
22:24:24 <ch878787> ok
22:24:29 <TheJollyRoger> Is that all?
22:24:36 <TheJollyRoger> Because if that's all, that's not the right location.
22:24:47 <ch878787> that is all
22:24:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you're doing it wrong. Let's simply start from the beginning.
22:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> 1)
22:25:35 <TheJollyRoger> mkdir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS
22:25:37 <TheJollyRoger> 2)
22:25:43 <TheJollyRoger> cd C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS
22:25:45 <TheJollyRoger> Do those two.
22:26:46 <ch878787> put them in powershell?
22:26:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
22:27:15 <ch878787> should i post what i find to you after each input?
22:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, including the commands you type. Once the prompt reads "PS C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS>" we're ready to continue
22:28:18 <ch878787> I put mkdir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS
22:28:22 <ch878787> and got
22:28:40 <ch878787>  Directory: C:\Users\Dell
22:28:50 <ch878787> now I will do your second step
22:28:52 <TheJollyRoger> Paste the entire thing.
22:28:56 <TheJollyRoger> Give me a screenshot if you can.
22:29:04 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not able to see and I no longer trust your word at it.
22:29:11 <ch878787> PS C:\Users\dell\platform-tools> mkdir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS
22:29:51 <ch878787> should i do your next step (2)
22:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
22:30:14 <ch878787> PS C:\Users\dell\platform-tools> cd C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS
22:31:19 <ch878787> hope all is ok so far
22:31:26 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Now does the prompt tell you that you've switched to C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS?
22:31:52 <ch878787> it says PS C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS>
22:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> (If you're copying the whole output, include the trailing prompt at the end, that tells me that the command has completed)
22:32:02 <ch878787> and cursor is blining just after that
22:32:22 <ch878787> ok look
22:32:25 <ch878787> PS C:\Users\dell\platform-tools> mkdir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS
22:32:27 <ch878787> C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS>
22:32:51 <TheJollyRoger> Great, that's what I want to see.
22:32:53 <TheJollyRoger> Step 3:
22:32:58 <ch878787> :)
22:33:00 <TheJollyRoger> curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.2-windows.zip
22:33:06 <TheJollyRoger> Wait for this one to finish.
22:33:37 <ch878787> so should I copy and past the above line and paste it in powershell and wait for it to do its thing
22:33:39 <ch878787> ?
22:33:46 <TheJollyRoger> Yes
22:33:50 <ch878787> ok
22:34:19 <TheJollyRoger> While we wait... what device do you have? Is it a Pixel 3, 3XL, 3a, or 3aXL?

22:35:30 <ch878787> it was a quick seeming error message
22:35:30 <TheJollyRoger> No, you need to run step 3.
22:35:38 <ch878787> i did
22:36:02 <ch878787> ohh
22:36:29 <TheJollyRoger> Please look at Step 3 again.
22:36:32 <ch878787> you mean go to "run" in the start menu and enter it there?
22:36:38 <ch878787> ok
22:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> No, I want you to enter it in Powershell.
22:37:09 <TheJollyRoger> You're also in the wrong location -- did you open up another window?
22:37:13 <ch878787> no
22:37:29 <TheJollyRoger> paste the prompt.
22:37:40 <ch878787> is the promot just curl.exe

22:37:44 <TheJollyRoger> no.
22:37:45 <ch878787> prompt
22:38:06 <TheJollyRoger> On the line next to the blinking cursor, do you see "PS C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS>" ?
22:38:29 <ch878787> yes
22:38:39 <TheJollyRoger> ok. in Powershell enter step 3.
22:39:16 <ch878787> so I will put

22:39:40 <TheJollyRoger> into Powershell, at the prompt of "PS C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS>"
22:39:49 <TheJollyRoger> And wait for that to complete.
22:40:27 <ch878787> i put the above in and now will hit enter ok
22:40:50 <TheJollyRoger> yes.
22:41:25 <TheJollyRoger> It needs to be exactly as typed, and when you see the PS C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS> prompt, I want to see the entire output.

22:42:40 <TheJollyRoger> "cd C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS" is not what I asked you to type at the prompt.

22:45:51 <TheJollyRoger> I'm sorry mate. Give me a minute.
22:46:02 <ch878787> ok
22:47:07 <TheJollyRoger> If you have a way to post images, show me a screenshot.
22:47:15 <TheJollyRoger> Since this is not working out.
22:47:41 <ch878787> one second
22:47:44 <TheJollyRoger> I can reach the download server from here... not sure why it's barfing about CRL
22:48:47 <TheJollyRoger> Unless your system clock is off or something.
22:48:51 <TheJollyRoger> *way off*
22:49:34 <ch878787> can i just delete platforms tools and re download t
22:49:36 <ch878787> it
22:50:02 <ch878787> i can extract it to a created folder
22:50:22 <ch878787> newly created folder*
22:50:22 <TheJollyRoger> Download it, and extract it so that all of its contents are within C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools\
22:50:31 <ch878787> ok
22:50:45 <TheJollyRoger> You will want fastboot to reside in C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
22:50:51 <TheJollyRoger> If it doesn't end up in there, don't continue.
22:51:13 <ch878787> ok
22:51:22 <ch878787> ill try now
22:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> there should be a folder called "platform-tools" in the .zip file.
22:51:35 <TheJollyRoger> The entire contents of platform-tools MUST BE KEPT TOGETHER
22:54:04 <ch878787> ok i extracted it to
22:54:06 <ch878787> C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools\
22:54:20 <ch878787> now what
22:55:18 <TheJollyRoger> Is fastboot.exe, adb.exe, and all the rest of the contents of platform tools in "C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools?" You absolutely sure you didn't do something like extract them to "C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools\platform-tools"?
22:55:23 <TheJollyRoger> Absolutely, 100% certain?
22:55:32 <ch878787> <<< checking
22:57:06 <ch878787> you are a genius.
22:57:28 <TheJollyRoger> If you want me to check, then in powershell, do "dir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\" and screenshot me the entire thing.
22:57:33 <ch878787> So do I copy and paste the contents in the platform tools folder
22:57:43 <TheJollyRoger> Put them all into where I told you to.
22:57:46 <schnenhcs[m]> Gonna spin my own builds of Graphene later this year. How well can one consolidate things to save resources?
22:57:46 <schnenhcs[m]> Can the java parts be reused for multiple devices?
22:57:46 <schnenhcs[m]> What else can?
22:58:07 <ch878787> ok
22:58:43 <ch878787> i did it jolly
22:58:48 <ch878787> :D
22:58:52 <TheJollyRoger> schnenhcs[m]: sorry, not sure at this moment. I'll have to get back to you on that since I'm only just trying to experiment with building now.
22:59:02 <schnenhcs[m]> My only source is xda until now and thats just on both ends of horrible. Dont have beefy hw yet
22:59:12 <TheJollyRoger> ch878787: ok great. In powershell I want you to try Step 3.5:
22:59:21 <TheJollyRoger> dir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools
22:59:27 <TheJollyRoger> Paste me the entire result.
22:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> Because if we go any further and you haven't set this up properly, it's going to be a dead end.
22:59:56 <ch878787> PS C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS> dir C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools
22:59:57 <ch878787> platform-tools
23:00:01 <ch878787> 23:53         427008 etc1tool.exe
23:00:04 <ch878787> mke2fs.conf
23:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> The whole thing, please.
23:00:28 <TheJollyRoger> Put it on ix.io or something.
23:00:44 <TheJollyRoger> Or, wait, you can't do that because you don't have curl. On pastebin or something.
23:01:03 <ch878787> platform-tools
23:01:05 <ch878787> 23:53         427008 etc1tool.exe
23:01:09 <ch878787> mke2fs.conf
23:01:31 <TheJollyRoger> Put the whole thing on pastebin, it's truncating you to three lines.
23:01:53 <ch878787> how do i put it on pastebin (never heard of it)
23:02:06 <ch878787> or
23:02:14 <ch878787> i can copy and paste the fastboot line?
23:02:28 <ch878787> -a----       11/06/2020     23:53        1393664 fastboot.exe
23:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> Go to pastebin.com and copy everything you see in Powershell into it since I told you to run that command.
23:03:14 <TheJollyRoger> Because the thing is, I can't really trust that you've done it correctly so I have to see the output for myself.
23:03:31 <ch878787> ok
23:03:44 <ch878787> i pasted it inside the textbox o pastebin.. now what do i do
23:03:58 <TheJollyRoger> Send me the link so I can see it.
23:04:42 <ch878787> i have to sign in apparently
23:05:28 <ch878787> i did do what you said
23:07:05 <TheJollyRoger> No you shouldn't. Just click create paste. https://pastebin.com/6rz8USwv
23:07:57 <ch878787> https://pastebin.com/W3607JRX
23:08:20 <ch878787> i live in uk btw
23:08:53 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, good. That's what I want to see.
23:09:16 <ch878787> yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
23:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> Step 4:
23:09:28 <ch878787> ok
23:10:02 <TheJollyRoger> $env:Path = "C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools;$env:Path"
23:10:14 <TheJollyRoger> Type that into Powershell exactly as it is.
23:10:19 <ch878787> ok
23:10:23 <TheJollyRoger> It will not return any output.
23:10:42 <ch878787> yep ok now what do i do
23:10:46 <TheJollyRoger> Once it is ready to accept more input, I want you to try
23:10:50 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
23:10:57 <TheJollyRoger> Into Powershell.
23:11:06 <TheJollyRoger> This is step 5: "fastboot --version"
23:11:07 <ch878787> Installed as C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\platform-tools\fastboot.exe
23:11:28 <TheJollyRoger> Does it say something like "Fastboot version 30.0.2-" and then some numbers?
23:11:31 <ch878787> *gulps*
23:11:46 <TheJollyRoger> Please paste everything.
23:11:48 <ch878787> yes it says fastboot version 30.0.2-6538114
23:11:58 <TheJollyRoger> Yes! We're making good progress!
23:12:01 <ch878787> omg
23:12:11 <ch878787> i hope this works
23:12:20 <TheJollyRoger> Now... don't close that powershell window.
23:12:24 <ch878787> ok
23:12:27 <ch878787> im scared
23:12:33 <TheJollyRoger> Copy down step 4 and save it.
23:12:43 <TheJollyRoger> If you do by accident close that powershell window, you will need to do Step 4 again.
23:12:50 <TheJollyRoger> Save it into a .txt file or something.
23:12:52 <TheJollyRoger> Or on a paper.
23:13:31 <ch878787> ok i did it
23:13:52 <TheJollyRoger> What Step 4 is doing, is it's saying to the computer: "When you are searching for commands to run, I want you to search to this location first, before the usual places you check."
23:14:15 <ch878787> ohh okk
23:14:20 <ch878787> i get it
23:14:30 <TheJollyRoger> So when you type in the "fastboot" command, the computer will see "Oh hey he wants me to search in this location first, and if I find something called "fastboot" that must be the one he wants me to run."
23:14:45 <ch878787> OT IT - WELL EXPLAINED
23:14:48 <ch878787> GOT IT :d
23:14:50 <ch878787> :D
23:14:53 <ch878787> :)
23:14:53 <TheJollyRoger> "If I don't find one there, then I search the usual places defined by the system for commands to run. If I still don't find it, tell him I hit an error."
23:15:00 <ch878787> ok
23:15:02 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense?
23:15:05 <ch878787> yes
23:15:27 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Ok, the next step... sorry. I forgot which device you had.
23:15:32 <TheJollyRoger> We're going to need to get the right one.
23:15:35 <ch878787> 3a
23:16:17 <TheJollyRoger> 3a. OK, now... the 3a is referred to internally at Google by the codename of "Sargo."
23:16:24 <ch878787> ok
23:16:46 <TheJollyRoger> If you're sure that's the right one, go and download this: https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2020.06.02.02.zip
23:17:24 <ch878787> pixel 3a
23:17:41 <ch878787> ok its d/l right now
23:17:44 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
23:17:58 <TheJollyRoger> While we wait, let's get your phone set up.
23:18:18 <ch878787> ok
23:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> This is going to require unlocking the bootloader, so if there's anything on your phone that you do not want to lose, now's the time to either save it, copy it, or disarm your 2FA on your accounts if you have One Time Password tokens saved to that phone.
23:18:47 <ch878787> its unlocked already
23:18:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great.
23:19:08 <ch878787> i did it using Youtuber Techlore's installation guide
23:19:21 <ch878787> but the flashing of the system image failed
23:19:25 <TheJollyRoger> If you switch it on, you're getting an ominous "Software Integrity Not Guaranteed!" warning in bright orange letters?
23:19:35 <ch878787> one sec
23:19:55 <ch878787> checking to confrm
23:20:04 <TheJollyRoger> Reboot it and if that ominous warning comes up, we're doing well.
23:20:11 <ch878787> yeh it came up
23:20:14 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
23:20:17 <ch878787> :)
23:20:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, plug it into your computer.
23:20:29 <TheJollyRoger> Now... couple guidelines as you do...
23:20:34 <ch878787> ok
23:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> First up, if your computer is a /desktop/, plug it directly into a port on the back of the computer, do not use your front ports.
23:21:03 <ch878787> i have laptop
23:21:21 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Use a USB-A to USB-C cable and plug it into the laptop.
23:21:29 <TheJollyRoger> Don't use a hub or a USB splitter.
23:21:43 <ch878787> i am using the 2.0 ports which are not the ones with "ss" inscribed near the mouth of the physical port (someone said it in the comments section of tech lores video
23:22:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ok... this might go a bit more slowly then.
23:22:07 <ch878787> ok
23:23:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hopefully this should work. Once that zip file is downloaded, I want you to unzip it to anywhere you like, but I want you to take note of where you unzip it to. We will need it.
23:24:16 <ch878787> ok unzipped
23:24:37 <TheJollyRoger> You may want to extract it to "C:\Users\Dell\GrapheneOS\" It should create a subfolder there that might look like sargo-factory-06.02.02
23:24:39 <TheJollyRoger> Do you see it?
23:24:58 <ch878787> i did it before you typed that last line
23:25:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do you know its exact location?
23:25:56 <ch878787> yes i do
23:26:16 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Navigate to it in Powershell using cd.
23:26:45 <ch878787> ok now what do i do
23:26:51 <TheJollyRoger> remember, the cd command stands for "Change Directory To..."
23:26:55 <ch878787> ok
23:27:09 <TheJollyRoger> Alright, bring up pastebin again and type in "dir" Do you see a file in there called "flash-all.bat"?
23:27:49 <ch878787> dir in powershell
23:27:51 <ch878787> ?
23:27:52 <TheJollyRoger> Paste me the results if you're uncertain.
23:27:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, in powershell.
23:28:42 <ch878787> I see that flash-all.bat
23:28:54 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Alright, return to your phone.
23:28:58 <TheJollyRoger> Switch it off.
23:29:30 <ch878787> switched off
23:30:14 <TheJollyRoger> Press and hold the Volumedown key, then press and hold down the Power key. Give it roughly seven or nine seconds, and it should turn on to fastboot again.
23:30:30 <TheJollyRoger> Keep 'em held down until fastboot comes on.
23:30:38 <ch878787> its on
23:30:50 <TheJollyRoger> Alright. Now in powershell, cross your fingers and type in:
23:31:05 <TheJollyRoger> ./flash-all.bat
23:31:22 <TheJollyRoger> This is step 7 (whoop, should've kept the numbers)
23:31:58 <ch878787> its listing fings
23:32:02 <ch878787> phone gong off and on
23:32:11 <ch878787> ummm
23:32:25 <ch878787> omg
23:32:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yep. Leave it be for a bit... Don't disturb your phone while it's installing.
23:32:37 <ch878787> now it says fastbootd
23:32:47 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Do you see a third option there that says "Reboot to Bootloader"?
23:32:55 <ch878787> yes
23:33:18 <ch878787> should i use the volume keys
23:33:21 <TheJollyRoger> you'll need to use the Volume Up and Volume Down keys to select it. Move it until it's highlighted and tap and release the power button as "enter"
23:33:22 <TheJollyRoger> Yep.
23:33:30 <TheJollyRoger> tap, then immediately release
23:33:58 <TheJollyRoger> Don't press and hold it, just click it once. Pressing and holding the POWER button for more than ten seconds is the Android equivalent of "Emergency Halt"
23:34:03 <ch878787> ok now what do i do its on fastboot mode now
23:34:17 <ch878787> ok
23:34:39 <TheJollyRoger> Step nine, do you see in the corner  some text commands? Tap the volume up key until you see it say "Start"
23:34:53 <ch878787> says start
23:34:57 <TheJollyRoger> this is just a quick sanity check to make sure that GrapheneOS indeed installed.
23:35:01 <ch878787> okk
23:35:05 <TheJollyRoger> Tap the power key and immediately release it.
23:35:20 <TheJollyRoger> Since right now the bootloader is not locked, so it's going to give you that ominous warning.
23:35:28 <TheJollyRoger> But that's OK just this once because this is only a test.
23:35:42 <ch878787> it says my device is corrupt and cant be used properly
23:35:55 <ch878787> do i press power button to continue
23:36:33 <ch878787> it says device is corrupt. it cant be trusted and may not work properly..
23:36:46 <TheJollyRoger> Give it ten seconds
23:36:49 <ch878787> it gives optio to press power to continue?
23:36:59 <TheJollyRoger> Hold up a moment...
23:37:07 <ch878787> ok i am waiting
23:38:21 <ch878787> nothing is happening but it does give me the option to press power button to continue?
23:38:56 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah give it a try.
23:39:17 <TheJollyRoger> This is really unusual though.
23:39:22 <ch878787> hmm
23:40:24 <TheJollyRoger> Fortunately, don't worry. It's not bricked, it's just that the flashing didn't complete properly.
23:40:34 <ch878787> ok
23:40:56 <ch878787> it is showing google startup first image/logo but it just stays there. shall we retry flash
23:40:57 <ch878787> ?
23:41:00 <TheJollyRoger> (The good news is, Google publishes factory images on their website, so you can always revert to the Google OS using the same method)
23:41:08 <TheJollyRoger> Before we retry it...
23:41:21 <TheJollyRoger> Just a sec.
23:41:25 <ch878787> ok
23:41:52 <ch878787> this was the farthest i have ever gotten which I am very pleased about but i just want it to work
23:42:09 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just checking something for you here.
23:42:12 <ch878787> ok
23:43:02 <TheJollyRoger> Since I normally don't keep images for devices I don't own I have to go download them.
23:43:14 <ch878787> ok
23:45:25 <TheJollyRoger> The size of the .zip should be 936MB... it's not coming up as any less, does it?
23:46:04 <ch878787> no but i am re-extracting it
23:46:17 <ch878787> see if i can do it again
23:46:34 <ch878787> do i need to keep them in the same folder when it extracts or move it anywehre
23:46:37 <ch878787> ?
23:46:56 <TheJollyRoger> As long as you can cd to and run the correct flash-all.bat
23:47:39 <ch878787> the zip was 936
23:47:51 <ch878787> one sec ok
23:47:57 <ch878787> should i turn my phone of?
23:47:59 <ch878787> off
23:48:01 <ch878787> ?
23:48:20 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to reboot to fastboot to flash it. Fastboot can only talk to the phone when it's in fastboot mode.
23:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> To get to fastboot, do what we did with holding down the volume down key and the power key until fastboot comes up.
23:49:17 <ch878787> ok just so you know I -re-extracted the zip and checked the total size afterward - 973mb
23:49:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, archives get larger when you unzip them.
23:49:40 <ch878787> cool ok
23:50:03 <TheJollyRoger> I was just wondering if you did something like try to extract it before it was finished downloading or something like that... normally that shouldn't happen.
23:50:44 <ch878787> i copied and pasted the files in the extracted folder, moved them in the sargo folder and deleted the previous one so maybe that caused a problem
23:51:28 <ch878787> so now I re-extracted it and have not copied or pasted anything... can you walk me through the final bit again
23:51:53 <ch878787> i hold power and volume down to go into fastboot right
23:52:00 <ch878787> after i power off?
23:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> I have no idea what you just did.-
23:52:14 <ch878787> i mean to say
23:52:24 <ch878787> when we flashed it just now
23:53:43 <ch878787> i had downloaded the system image and unzipped it. so there were two folders...sargo and when i cliked into sargo another one with all the contents of the unzipped file. i copied and pasted those contents into the sargo one and delted the original
23:53:55 <ch878787> this time i wont do that
23:54:19 <ch878787> so i will power my phone off first yeh?
23:54:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah sorry man, I can't actually trust you at your word and I don't know what you're doing there.
23:55:08 <ch878787> ok
23:55:21 <ch878787> can we try reflashing
23:56:24 <ch878787> oh boy. i cant power my phone off
23:56:52 <ch878787> ok i am in fastboot mode
23:56:54 <ch878787> :)
23:57:58 <TheJollyRoger> You can try reflashing, I'm not sure what went wrong with it; a majority of problems get caused by USB on the host, or a bad cable.
23:58:05 <TheJollyRoger> I'm out of time and have to head off for a bit.
23:58:29 <ch878787> ok thanks for your help anyways
23:59:36 <TheJollyRoger> If all else fails try from a different computer.
