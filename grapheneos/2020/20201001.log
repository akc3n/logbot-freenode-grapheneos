00:18:58 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Is it OK to disable android webview network permissions till they get swapped to GoS parameters
00:19:32 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Or disable it completely ?
00:33:19 <renlord> Lckdyspl7[m]: what are you asking?
00:45:22 <louipc> GoS grade of service?
01:03:04 <riotuser1993[m]> Why is aurora telling me I need to update auditor and android system webview?
01:03:04 <riotuser1993[m]> Both built in apps..
01:07:26 <lev[m]> these questions have come up like 40 million times in the past few days, search and ye shall find your answers
01:21:40 <aeonsolution[m]> <lev[m] "these questions have come up lik"> yeah, it would be nice if the transient newcomers would at least read the information on the website or search the logs. its really discouraging.
01:25:49 <lev[m]> I can more understand a little more if they're coming from irc, since having a log to search is a bit less common
01:25:56 <lev[m]> but yeah, it's right in the topic lol
01:27:41 <aeonsolution[m]> i think its great that youve stuck around, thats really the only way you can learn from the community
01:28:54 <aeonsolution[m]> the transient newcomers treat the channel like a helpdesk and that is just way off lol
01:29:19 <lev[m]> oh yeah, I've definitely learned lots of stuff from the chatter here, it's a great community
01:30:16 <lev[m]> thats a fairly common mindset, people want immediate answers and not to have to spend any of their own time to attempt to solve a problem
01:30:32 <lev[m]> though I don't think it's always laziness, but possibly a lack of confidence in their own ability to solve the problem
01:31:21 <aeonsolution[m]> and i think the lack of confidence is fine as long as they are willing to be open minded when they are getting help from the community
01:32:05 <lev[m]> yeah for sure, gentle urging to read the documentation, or to search for their question, seems warranted
01:32:22 <aeonsolution[m]> right. absent of that, they are not respecting people's time.
01:32:30 <louipc> maybe would be good to have a helpdesk of sorts tho
01:32:52 <lev[m]> there are also a lot of poeple who are used to a 'product' rather than a 'project'
01:33:03 <lev[m]> where the onus is on the provider to make it work, and to help you understand, in all circumstances
01:34:20 <aeonsolution[m]> the provider doesnt even give app support!
01:34:39 <aeonsolution[m]> people are lucky if they get a ticket opened lol
01:34:54 <meow_please[m]> GitHub has a discussions feature that lets people ask questions and mark them as answered. You can search, all posts have edit history, etc. And it's integrated with GitHub so you can reference code and issues.  So, definitely check it out. Obviously proprietary but who the hell wants to edit and maintain a wiki when you can let users do it in a discussion / stack overflow format instead?
01:35:13 <meow_please[m]> It's in beta
01:35:59 <poisonoushydra> :: installls an UNsupported operating system, expects to be supported ::
01:36:12 <lev[m]> is stackoverflow owned by someone?
01:36:22 <lev[m]> sounds like github discussions is MS trying to compete in that space
01:36:33 <lev[m]> stackoverflow is kind of unmatched there, now that I think about it
01:37:39 <meow_please[m]> Eh I don't think it's competing. It's just bringing communities into one relevant place instead of forcing devs to scatter across various services like discord, slack, etc.
01:39:15 <meow_please[m]> It's good to be decentralized but these newbie questions will NEVER stop unless there is a QA place for them to go to / search. And that doesn't exist. IRC + the logs  is not a replacement for it.
01:39:22 <lev[m]> yeah, it seems like a pretty reasonable idea, but that's for sure competition, I am not implying malice or anything, it's just better for business for people to stay on your site
01:39:48 <meow_please[m]> Agreed
01:41:10 <brockin042[m]1> I was scared! Pixel 2xl recent beta update took 15 min to boot.
01:41:55 <louipc> hey its beta afterall
01:42:51 <meow_please[m]> Oh snap. Gitter is joining Matrix... hopefully that means more people coming here! :)
01:59:03 <nickcalyx[m]> > I was scared! Pixel 2xl recent beta update took 15 min to boot.
01:59:03 <nickcalyx[m]> Yeah it took a long ass time on CalyxOS too
02:42:54 <renlord> helpdesk for open source project? LOL
02:44:00 <meow_please[m]> I think he meant more of a QA not a help desk. Like stack overflow or GitHub discussions (beta).
02:48:56 <louipc> why the hell not.
02:50:36 <louipc> maybe even powered by ai
02:59:54 <waosvavbzirarns4> Howdy! Finally got my ass off reddit to join the real forum
03:00:55 <waosvavbzirarns4> Gotta say, I bought a Pixel 4 XL a few months ago and I could not be happier about this OS
03:16:23 <Lckdyspl7[m]> <renlord "L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: what are you askin"> Well the android webviewer keeps opening itself when I freeze all my apps it shows it opened.
03:16:54 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Will it open every time I open vand now or something.?
03:17:24 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Didn't notice it beforehand constantly running
03:19:02 <Lckdyspl7[m]> I wanna know can I disable it without the phone imploding on me
03:22:06 <strcat[m]> L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: the WebView is what provides the web renderer for apps
03:22:11 <strcat[m]> not sure why you want to disable a core OS component
03:22:44 <strcat[m]> they are going to crash because they aren't going to handle the exception from WebView being missing if you disable it
03:22:47 <Lckdyspl7[m]> I never seen it pop up before, thought it was something new running rougue
03:22:55 <strcat[m]> lots of app embed web content
03:23:16 <strcat[m]> L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: the app id is just temporarily different until we're doing Vanadium WebView builds against
03:23:29 <strcat[m]> org.grapheneos.vanadium.webview is what it will be called again
03:23:30 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Okay that makes abit more sense
03:23:39 <strcat[m]> it's not used by Vanadium browser
03:24:09 <strcat[m]> it's a library used by other apps and runs a sandboxed browser rendering process for them
03:24:11 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Yeah I am aware of that change üòä
03:24:17 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Thanks for clearing that up
03:27:18 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Ahh so when I click a link in an app and it brings up the web page in the app, its webview.
03:27:24 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Right! üëç
03:38:11 <strcat[m]> L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: well
03:38:11 <strcat[m]> it depends
03:38:42 <strcat[m]> L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: if you click a link in an app that usually either opens the browser or a custom tab from the browser
03:38:52 <strcat[m]> you can tell it's that because it has the Vanadium menu
03:39:18 <strcat[m]> L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: apps that use a web rendering widget themselves are using the WebView
03:39:32 <strcat[m]> a mail client rendering HTML email, lots of embedded forms for login to services, many others things
03:39:35 <strcat[m]> many apps use it
03:39:58 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of WebView-based web browsers but that isn't really what I'm talking about
06:53:03 <arouzing[m]> update just dropped for my pixel 3 :D going to go read the patch notes!
07:43:25 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Is there a new stable
07:45:28 <Lckdyspl7[m]> My phones downloading an update on stable channel, is this a GoS release ? I've disabled seemless updates till I get an anwser
07:46:05 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Nevermind just real release stuff
07:46:14 <Lckdyspl7[m]> * Nevermind just read release stuff
09:01:26 <ajsodij> Hi. I've had some issues with the latest 2 updates. When an audioplayer (not the pre-installed one) run by an added user is paused, the screen goes black and I have to unlock the phone again.
09:02:03 <ajsodij> It also happens on play and rewind
09:02:29 <louipc> howd u install that player
09:02:51 <ajsodij> I've tried with AntennaPod, Voice and AudioAnchor
09:02:54 <ajsodij> F-droid
09:03:10 <ajsodij> It worked fine before the Android 11 update
09:03:17 <louipc> theres been a lot of problems with fdroid apps on current android
09:03:35 <louipc> they use old signatures with fake new API
09:04:25 <ajsodij> Okay. Thanks.
09:04:46 <louipc>  you might want to try an apk straight from the developer or via aurora store, but app sig will be different, so the data store will be different
09:05:18 <louipc> probably best to avoid fdroid in the future
09:05:59 <d3nm6ugnffwftn24> Hi, has anybody experienced gcam stopped working with gcam service provider since Android 11 update? I'm wondering what could cause the issue... Thanks!
09:13:57 <ajsodij> I should've looked at the issue tracker. It's there already
09:14:21 <somerand0m[m]> Is there a known issue with not being able to dismiss or snooze alarms when the screen is locked?When this happens I need to unlock my phone and dismiss it through notifications.
09:14:57 <dazinism> somerand0m: not tried, but think you can tap on the notification on the lock screen?
09:17:35 <sphinxcat[m]> <louipc "they use old signatures with fak"> That's not related.
09:18:10 <sphinxcat[m]> * That's not related to the issue.
09:18:14 <louipc> i see
09:22:18 <cecemimi[m]> There was an update a few days ago, and on reboot, my f-droid flashlight app was uninstalled and vinyl music player 'keeps stopping' after its splash screen. Is this kind of thing known/ordinary?
09:23:04 <louipc> oh yea that is definitely the fdroid thing. apps disappearing
09:23:40 <louipc> seems like theres a problem with music players tho
09:24:03 <dazinism> cecemimi: yeah, the app disappearing is a problem with fdroid. Think the player acting weird is an issue with Android 11
09:24:07 <cecemimi[m]> So i reinstalled flashlight, ok, but vinyl cant work still
09:24:35 <cecemimi[m]> Oh ok
09:24:42 <dazinism> Maybe try a different player for a bit?
09:25:29 <cecemimi[m]> Sure, will do, recommendations welcome, but will search
09:26:06 <ajsodij> It only happens when I run the apps by a separate (not main) user account
09:36:49 <sphinxcat[m]> [cecemimi](https://matrix.to/#/@cecemimi:matrix.org): Maybe this is the bug of Vinyl: https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer/issues/288
09:51:07 <cecemimi[m]> Thanks for pointing to that, good to know.

10:16:39 <somerand0m[m]> day known Odd. When I leave the device on a flat surface I have the options. But if I pickup the device I lose those options on the lock screen.
10:45:05 <unsafeoppa[m]> @renlord can I pm you?
10:50:49 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Shuttle+ works.awesome.as a music player
11:04:29 <alzxjm[m]1> I like Vinyl player.
11:25:37 <syscall[m]> Can I usw Ethernet with an usb-c otg Ethernet adapter ?  I usw the pi
11:25:37 <syscall[m]> xel 2  thanks for any advice ...
11:33:01 <dazinism> somerand0m: you can turn off 'lift to check phone' in gesture settings.
11:33:54 <dazinism> syscall: some people have used ethernet via usb otg
11:37:26 <null[m]> I use "Music". Fork of Phonograph just like Vinyl is.
11:37:27 <null[m]> I don't remember the exact differences
12:56:01 <somerand0m[m]> <dazinism "somerand0m: you can turn off 'li"> Yep, it works when you turn it off. I guess I'll need to leave it at that for the time being or switch the Google one which works.
13:11:32 <unknown01234[m]> <somerand0m[m] "IMG_0454-1.jpg"> What vpn do you use?
13:15:09 <makingaliasesisa> I use mullvad.

13:20:52 <makingaliasesisa> but thank you
13:32:03 <somerand0m[m]> <unknown01234[m] "What vpn do you use?"> Probably not the answer you're looking for but It's a VPN to my home. :)
13:32:14 <makingaliasesisa> nice
13:32:29 <makingaliasesisa> i think that is cool. I want to do something similar.
13:32:51 <makingaliasesisa> /exactly
13:33:53 <makingaliasesisa> wireguard as well?
13:34:05 <somerand0m[m]> It's only really worthwhile if you have resources at home you want to use or route all your traffic through.
13:34:30 <makingaliasesisa> yeah i have the resources
13:34:43 <somerand0m[m]> Nah IPSec for the time being but I will transition.
13:35:10 <makingaliasesisa> Cool
14:17:27 <Erraverunt> Anyone using Vinyl music player? Newest relase says android 11 compatible but works randomly or doesnt work
14:21:10 <Sheru[m]> <Erraverunt "Anyone using Vinyl music player?"> I have it, not tested yet
14:21:19 <Sheru[m]> I'll go check
14:22:00 <Erraverunt> Background player is not on the first drag down menu from top, but on second, and cant close the app from there
14:25:52 <alzxjm[m]1> <Erraverunt "Anyone using Vinyl music player?"> Works so far for me. A11 on Pixel 4 XL
14:26:03 <alzxjm[m]1> I use it daily.
14:28:03 <Erraverunt> Or has the drag down menu from top changed radically that I cant close apps from there any more?
14:29:47 <Sheru[m]> <Erraverunt "Anyone using Vinyl music player?"> It crashes on me
14:30:43 <Sheru[m]> It's literally unusable
14:31:16 <Erraverunt> Yeah same for me, which device are you on?
14:31:55 <Erraverunt> The newest aurora store version doesnt crash for me, but doesnt work like it should
14:32:04 <Erraverunt> froid version crashes instanly
14:32:12 <Sheru[m]> Pixel 3a
14:32:21 <Sheru[m]> I use aurora store
14:32:26 <Erraverunt> I'm on pixel 3a too
14:32:30 <Sheru[m]> Odd, Aurora Store version crashes on me frequently.
14:33:00 <Sheru[m]> <Erraverunt "froid version crashes instanly"> It's outdated, right?
14:33:04 <Sheru[m]> I'll retry
14:33:14 <Erraverunt> Yeah I think it is
14:33:35 <Sheru[m]> 24.0.169
14:33:42 <Sheru[m]> On Aurora Store
14:33:56 <Sheru[m]> Anyways, I only gave it Storage permission on Media, nothing else.
14:34:20 <Sheru[m]> If it crashes because no network permission, uninstalling it in a heartbeat
14:34:27 <Sheru[m]> App developers need to be competent
14:34:58 <Sheru[m]> Not do stupid crap like crashing when network permission is denied
14:35:57 <louipc> make a better one :D
14:36:09 <anupritaisno1[m4> <Sheru[m] "Not do stupid crap like crashing"> You realize who is wrong here?
14:37:16 <Erraverunt> I only gave storage too, doesnt crash but I see that android 11 changed the notification "area" which is causing my problems. Also imo changed for worse
14:38:50 <Sheru[m]> Yeah sure, forcing user to grant internet permission
14:39:22 <Sheru[m]> It plays normally after granting it, then denying it again
14:40:08 <Sheru[m]> Would have been better if apps were designed to run with or without such permission, even Microsoft does this thing
14:40:26 <Erraverunt> any way to close vinyl from notifications with swiping right, like it was possible before android 11?
14:44:05 <Sheru[m]> Not really
14:44:52 <Sheru[m]> <Erraverunt "any way to close vinyl from noti"> Pausing it in app/notif or force stopping are the only ways
14:45:12 <Erraverunt> Cant even close vinyl from swiping up from bottom to show running apps and closing it there
14:45:19 <Erraverunt> Both of these worked before
14:45:53 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, consider checking their issue tracker?
14:47:37 <Sheru[m]>  * Would have been better if apps were designed to run with or without such permission, even Microsoft does this thing (as in forced network permission unnecessarily)
14:50:42 <Erraverunt> Yeah checked it, it only has 1 problem which I have listed (file names not displayed if they have no tags), propably gotta report these problems myself
15:00:41 <faxing[m]> yay 2-button navigation is back in settings!
15:00:42 <faxing[m]> lol
15:00:57 <Sheru[m]> Yay
15:01:18 <Sheru[m]> If only it has the same app switching option, but it's better than nothing yay
15:07:02 <esmspwdcesmrcbt4> <Sheru[m] "Not do stupid crap like crashing"> That's not it.
15:08:03 <Sheru[m]> Yeah
15:08:15 <Sheru[m]> It was not the only issur
16:29:48 * hkprotestor11[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ZWTUVylgXMdCAkPKeVJuvpZo/message.txt >
16:31:46 <hkprotestor11[m]>  * Hello everyone. I have a question regarding the Android 11 port. I usually check GitHub to be updated with GrapheneOS development and I see that the "port SELinux policy hardening from Android 10 to Android 11" issue in the Android 11 port milestone is still open with only 2 closed PR's and another 8 still open.
16:31:47 <hkprotestor11[m]> I've been holding back updating my phone to Android because I fear it'll degrade the OS security, I'm a Hong Kong protestor and I'm sure you already know that the authorities are not really friendly around here.
16:31:47 <hkprotestor11[m]> Should I hold back updating until the team finishes the hardening porting or am I safe? I really don't want to take any chances with police around here.
16:31:47 <hkprotestor11[m]>  * Hello everyone. I have a question regarding the Android 11 port.

16:40:49 <anupritaisno1[m4> [hkprotestor11](https://matrix.to/#/@hkprotestor11:matrix.org): I've already finished the selinux port
16:41:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> There's a PR with properly cleaned commits already open by me and tested
16:42:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> If you want to see the actual steps for the bringup you can see the whole commit history here https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/platform_system_sepolicy/commits/11
16:42:43 <anupritaisno1[m4> The entire thing was squashed on the pr branch and sent in
16:43:08 <anupritaisno1[m4> It's just that there's other issues that take more priority than selinux hardening right now
16:45:59 <hkprotestor11[m]> Well thanks a lot for the wonderful work to you and the whole team. So you've done all the work needed and tested but it's like, we can say, in the queue to be committed in the Graphene repos?
16:47:10 <anupritaisno1[m4> Yes
16:47:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> Although everything seems fine on the surface it will take a while to review this
16:49:30 <hkprotestor11[m]> In general, I always prefer that things take as much time as they need rather than do it the EA Games way, publish an unfinished product with first day updates
16:50:20 <hkprotestor11[m]> Given my situation, should I wait and stick to the stable Android 11 release for now or should I update to latest stable? I just don't want to take chances with HK government
16:50:46 <anupritaisno1[m4> Selinux hardening is only for the base system
16:52:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> What we are doing is we mark system apps
16:52:36 <anupritaisno1[m4> By their signature since we sign them ourselves
16:52:46 <anupritaisno1[m4> Then we just out them in a separate selinux context
16:56:24 <hkprotestor11[m]> Thanks for all that info and for being friendly. stay safe everyone
16:58:30 <anupritaisno1[m4> [hkprotestor11](https://matrix.to/#/@hkprotestor11:matrix.org): and then we remove a few permissions for the base system
17:40:56 <graphene4tw3[m]> Hey guys, is there going to be Pixel 5 support?
17:42:31 <alzxjm[m]1> <graphene4tw3[m] "Hey guys, is there going to be P"> Maybe. Depends on whether or not someone volunteers to be a Pixel 5 device maintainer.
17:42:53 <alzxjm[m]1> There is no guarantee this will happen.
17:47:54 <strcat[m]> hkprotestor11: you should certainly upgrade... otherwise you're missing the 2020-09-05 security update and the substantial privacy and security improvements in Android 11
17:49:22 <strcat[m]> hkprotestor11: you're hurting your privacy and security by not following along with the updates, we weren't going to hold back an important upgrade just because not all our downstream security enhancements were ported over, and the vast majority is ported over
18:50:24 <ferahdi[m]> Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to ask. But all of the sudden Hotspot is not working and I tried the factory reset. Two factor applications also stopped working a few days ago. Looked around and can not see anyone else reporting these issues. Is this to be expected and I need to do a re-install of GrapheneOS?
18:56:49 <propertype[m]> Auditor has stopped working since the latest update. If I try to manually start an attestation it fails too.
18:57:21 <strcat[m]> failing in what sense?

19:04:21 <strcat[m]> can you see what happens if you set your date to 2016
19:04:24 <strcat[m]> and then try verifying
19:04:31 <strcat[m]> on both devices
19:04:33 <propertype[m]> Sure. moment
19:05:11 <strcat[m]> all that changed in in the most recent release is that we fixed time sync
19:06:25 <alzxjm[m]1> I can replicate this on Pixel 4 XL
19:06:39 <strcat[m]> try the date suggestion I gave above to debug
19:06:50 <strcat[m]> all we changed in the last release is fixing time sync
19:06:56 <strcat[m]> this seems like an Android 11 Titan M bug
19:07:36 <strcat[m]> Auditor is doing what it's supposed to be doing
19:07:38 <ferahdi[m]> I am running same build and get the same error. Pixel 3a
19:07:42 <strcat[m]> it's getting invalid information
19:07:45 <strcat[m]> from hardware
19:07:56 <propertype[m]> Now I got that. My date is October 1 2016

19:08:05 <alzxjm[m]1> Under Settings > Date & time? Manually change the phone to a 2016 date?
19:08:57 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: try even earlier
19:08:58 <strcat[m]> 2010
19:09:06 <strcat[m]> seems Titan M is not getting time synced to it properly
19:09:09 <strcat[m]> seems like a Titan M bug
19:09:09 <propertype[m]> OK. Brb

19:10:35 <propertype[m]> Not working with 2010 either
19:10:47 <alzxjm[m]1> No change for me using 2010
19:10:58 <strcat[m]> but the date did change
19:11:18 <propertype[m]> Yes. Did change when I used 2016, too
19:24:05 <Sheru[m]> Can confirm this bug happens
19:27:58 <Sheru[m]> Changing the date to 2022-2023 makes the local verification work
19:28:03 <strcat[m]> well, Auditor is catching a real problem
19:28:06 <strcat[m]> I can release an update that stops checking for the problem
19:28:20 <strcat[m]> I am not sure what to do about that

19:28:29 <Sheru[m]> Occured at latest beta update at sargo
19:28:30 <strcat[m]> Auditor is correct
19:28:40 <strcat[m]> Sheru: it's just because the latest update added back network time sync
19:29:09 <strcat[m]> the network time sync is working properly
19:29:47 <anupritaisno1[m4> ah i see
19:29:48 <anupritaisno1[m4> validity not before 2022
19:30:11 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, apparently that is a problem too
19:30:12 <anupritaisno1[m4> Sheru: erase data for auditor
19:30:17 <Sheru[m]> Alright
19:30:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> pair it again btw
19:30:34 <anupritaisno1[m4> old pairings won't work

19:31:15 <Sheru[m]> Same issue
19:31:25 <Sheru[m]> I'll be right back testing at 2021, 2022
19:31:31 <propertype[m]> <anupritaisno1[m4 "pair it again btw"> Doesn't really solve the core of the problem does it?
19:32:25 <anupritaisno1[m4> oh yeah i forgot
19:32:30 <anupritaisno1[m4> why would that work
19:34:39 <anupritaisno1[m4> mrxx_0 is typing a novel guys
19:35:02 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey strcat it has been few months since I am using GrapheneOS and I want to help maintaining a device. I am on a 3a XL atm (this is my primary phone, can't do much on it). I just had my internship's pay and wanted to work on Pixel 5. But we will not get upstream AOSP before months so I prefer working on an older device. The 4a was in my choice, but what suits the best for you since you are working on 2/2XL (near from
19:35:02 <mrxx_0[m]> the end but sill) 3/3XL and 3a/3aXL ? Maybe I can find a cheap 3a or xl and you prefer working on the 4a ? Tell me :)
19:35:09 <anupritaisno1[m4> just remember that matrix doesn't handle huge messages well and you may need to reset your client if it stops working
19:35:22 <mrxx_0[m]> anupritaisno1: hahaha you were right
19:35:25 <anupritaisno1[m4> mrxx_0 you should tag me
19:35:40 <anupritaisno1[m4> i do all the new bringups for now
19:35:57 <mrxx_0[m]> Oh my bad, I didn't know
19:36:08 <mrxx_0[m]> Glad you were here when I send the message
19:36:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> buy whatever you want
19:36:45 <anupritaisno1[m4> then message me
19:37:04 <anupritaisno1[m4> it'll be quite a while before we support the 5 and later devices btw
19:37:17 <anupritaisno1[m4> we don't even have bendor support going for them yet
19:37:28 <anupritaisno1[m4>  * we don't even have vendor support going for them yet
19:37:42 <anupritaisno1[m4> fucking shit keyboard always a typo everywhere
19:38:06 <mrxx_0[m]> So 3a would be a good choice
19:38:16 <anupritaisno1[m4> 4a
19:38:37 <Sheru[m]> It does not
19:38:50 <Sheru[m]> Only when changing the date to 2023 and beyond
19:38:58 <Sheru[m]> Local attestaion will work
19:39:15 <mrxx_0[m]> Got it anupritaisno1
19:39:16 <anupritaisno1[m4> Sheru reset
19:39:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> it must go
19:39:47 <Sheru[m]> I have reset every single date change
19:39:53 <anupritaisno1[m4> we cannot allow such an invalid certificate to be used
19:39:59 <anupritaisno1[m4> and it is not just auditor
19:40:06 <anupritaisno1[m4> other apps will also be affected
19:40:37 <anupritaisno1[m4> Sheru i mean go to recovery and wipe data
19:40:39 <Sheru[m]> Yeah, ask everyone to reset
19:40:55 <anupritaisno1[m4> Sheru: not necessary
19:40:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're giving bad advice
19:41:00 <strcat[m]> people shouldn't ever repair
19:41:07 <strcat[m]>  * people shouldn't ever redo the pairing
19:41:08 <anupritaisno1[m4> anyone who upgraded will just have their proper cert
19:41:13 <strcat[m]> no
19:41:16 <strcat[m]> that's not the problem
19:41:24 <strcat[m]> you're giving bad advice
19:41:25 <Sheru[m]> Huh, it still gives off green at later date (2023 and beyond)
19:41:47 <strcat[m]> Sheru: yes because as you can see from the output the certificate is being marked as having a Not Before date of 2022
19:41:54 <strcat[m]> by the secure element
19:42:05 <strcat[m]> and Auditor is correctly producing an error
19:42:13 <strcat[m]> it isn't 2022
19:42:22 <strcat[m]> if a certificate isn't valid until 2022, it isn't valid yet
19:42:22 <anupritaisno1[m4> strcat: sorry
19:42:40 <strcat[m]> people should NEVER delete pairings when they encounter an error with an existing pairing that was working
19:42:40 <anupritaisno1[m4> i deleted those messages
19:42:59 <strcat[m]> they should never delete pairings either for local verification or remote verification based on it not working anymore
19:43:16 <strcat[m]> then you lose the ability to perform a strong verification rather than starting over again with a new initial weak verification
19:43:43 <strcat[m]> if a strong verification fails that is not a reason to delete the pairing and start over with a weak verification
19:44:08 <strcat[m]> and if it DID address the problem, how do you know it's not because you threw away the ability to do a strong verification?
19:44:33 <strcat[m]> you can no longer confirm it's the same device as before or that the old device wasn't compromised
19:44:53 <strcat[m]> getting an error about an invalid date (look at what it says in the output) is a bad reason to wipe your ability to do strong verifications
19:45:09 <strcat[m]> Auditor is doing the right thing here - it's finding a problem
19:45:21 <strcat[m]> I don't know what the cause of the problem is, but it's a real problem being found, some kind of time sync issue
19:45:47 <strcat[m]> there is not much point of using Auditor if you're going to ignore the problems it finds and treat it as a bug in Auditor
19:49:02 <strcat[m]> according to the output, the attestation certificate has a Not Before date of 2022, making it invalid
19:49:09 <strcat[m]> we don't know why that's happening for some people yet
19:49:30 <strcat[m]> we do know that in the last release of GrapheneOS, we added back working network time updates by fixing our HTTPS network time update implementation
19:49:43 <strcat[m]> we haven't changed the code that syncs it from the OS to other components
19:50:16 <strcat[m]> but it seems there's either something wrong with that code, or with the code handling this on those components, including the secure element used by Auditor to generate keys (it doesn't use TrustZone if a secure element keystore is available)
19:50:34 <strcat[m]> Auditor is correct that it's invalid - it's not an Auditor or AttestationServer bug
19:50:43 <strcat[m]> it could be temporarily worked around in Auditor / AttestationServer
20:04:33 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Shuttle+ works.awesome.as a music player
20:11:45 <strcat[m]> going to do a temporary workaround for Auditor and AttestationServer
20:12:07 <strcat[m]> it doesn't need to be validating the date on the first certificate, just the remaining ones in the chain, since the first one has the random challenge in it anyway
20:17:20 <strcat[m]> seems to work
20:17:26 <strcat[m]> doing a new release of the Auditor app with a workaround for this
20:23:34 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases/tag/21
20:23:35 <strcat[m]> try this
20:28:33 <alzxjm[m]1> That worked.
20:32:59 <strcat[m]> if people run into issues with a Beta release we need to know so we can address the issues and push out a new release instead
20:34:22 <strcat[m]> this is an upstream issue that Auditor uncovers and it seems that when we added back time sync in the last release that triggers this time sync issue in the firmware
20:34:43 <strcat[m]> it only happens with the secure element keystore, not the TrustZone keystore
20:35:07 <strcat[m]> so if we were still using the TEE everywhere we wouldn't have run into it but we use the more secure SE (StrongBox) keystore when available
20:35:19 <strcat[m]> and apparently there are still growing pains with StrongBox
20:35:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> strcat: wait so we don't need to check validity date of the root cert?
20:35:30 <strcat[m]> we have one of the few apps using it
20:35:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: we don't need to check that but the code is still checking it
20:35:43 <anupritaisno1[m4> just the remaining certs in the chain?
20:35:46 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: read what the code is doing carefully
20:35:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the certificates go attestation -> batch -> intermediate -> root
20:36:07 <strcat[m]> we are only disabling checking Not Before / Not After for our own attestation certificate
20:36:23 <strcat[m]> and we know that's safe because we are checking that it contains the random challenge
20:36:32 <strcat[m]> which the Auditor side provided to the Auditee side
20:36:49 <strcat[m]> so it can't be using a stale certificate anyway - and it would be insecure to actually rely on checking Not Before / Not After rather than the challenge
20:37:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: of course, we should be able to check them, but it doesn't downgrade security in any way to only check the batch, intermediate and root time validity
20:37:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I had no reason to only check those when I could just check all of them, but since there is a time sync issue, we can't check the attestation certificate times right now
20:38:09 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: also, this is essentially a permanent issue now
20:38:19 <strcat[m]> since persistent certificates are going to have the wrong times
20:38:23 <strcat[m]> but what else can I do about it?
20:40:30 <strcat[m]> I don't really see what else we could do
20:40:59 <strcat[m]> we are limited by hardware capabilities
20:41:14 <strcat[m]> if the secure element doesn't know how to set proper times on the attestation certificate we just can't be enforcing checks on them
20:41:27 <strcat[m]> each device has unique problems
20:41:36 <strcat[m]> trying to support a ton of devices in Auditor has proved to be too hard
20:41:42 <strcat[m]>  * trying to support a ton of devices in Auditor has proven to be too hard
20:41:59 <strcat[m]> without a dedicated maintainer for Auditor device support we can't be expanding device support further in it
20:43:20 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "without a dedicated maintainer f"> but i already said i will be doing it
20:45:06 <strcat[m]> I thought about it some more
20:45:13 <strcat[m]> and after this firmware issue is fixed I think we can remove the workaround
22:10:20 <cx2[m]> Hey all, random request:
22:10:20 <cx2[m]> I‚Äôm in school for software development (finally). I have an assignment that requires an ‚ÄúInformational Interview.‚Äù Essentially I am to interview someone currently working in the field that I am studying.
22:15:57 * cx2[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kSRxWEbaBirwLunDWPtanucx/message.txt >
22:54:21 <anupritaisno1> Okay

22:54:43 <anupritaisno1> Do you see this message?
22:57:21 <louipc> yes
22:59:54 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Hi, i am in the latest Beta (29.9 but the Bug was also in the Version before) and have a strange bug when using deezer in my Music user profile. When i hit play the screen turns black and then goes on again. Sometime i am getting a Notification while this occurs about the full screen mode enganging or something like that.

23:02:24 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat[m] "shdudbdjdj: can you get logs fro"> I will do so (:
23:04:38 <strcat[m]> we've heard people say they have issues with the camera on Android 11 and in certain cases with music apps seemingly tied to secondary profiles
23:04:48 <strcat[m]> but we need more information
23:05:19 <strcat[m]> I closed the issue currently opened about issues with the camera because it hasn't been productive, not getting answers to my questions or the requested information
23:05:37 <strcat[m]> I need someone to file an issue that's going to be able to provide the requested information and stick to the topic of the issue (file 1 issue per problem)
23:06:26 <strcat[m]> if we can't replicate an issue and the user won't help us debug it by trying our suggestions and getting the necessary info, it has to be closed

23:14:53 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat[m] "if we can't replicate an issue a"> I try my best to help :D I am good in following instructions:P
23:18:22 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/338 was the camera issue report
23:19:15 <strcat[m]> was initially filed on the AttestationServer repository twice and I transferred this one here + deleted the other
23:19:39 <strcat[m]> and I edited out + deleted comments talking about other stuff to keep it on this topic
23:19:54 <strcat[m]> but... if I'm not going to get info I need from it, might as well give up on it and wait for someone else to file one
23:23:43 <strcat[m]> I'll probably do another release primarily to push out the new Auditor v21 to everyone
23:24:15 <strcat[m]> but would be nice to include any other relevant fixes for the next release
23:24:27 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat[m] "https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os"> My camera works find on3a and latest update (:
23:24:53 <shdudbdjdj[m]> *on the
23:25:58 <strcat[m]> I should have done this more aggressive workaround for the time issue originally in v19 of Auditor

23:26:19 <strcat[m]> > workaround for StrongBox issue discovered on Android 11 Pixels
23:26:49 <strcat[m]> I implemented the workaround I've switched to now earlier, but I decided to use a less aggressive workaround
23:26:54 <strcat[m]> since that was working then
23:27:11 <strcat[m]> since it's a time issue, it seems like time passing has made the problem worse
23:27:37 <strcat[m]> I suspect the issue is something like time being serialized and sent over to the secure element in a broken way
23:27:47 <strcat[m]> it's occurring on the stock OS too (that's where we originally detected and worked around it)
23:28:10 <strcat[m]> it got worse recently, past couple days
23:28:31 <strcat[m]> I don't think it was connected to our release after all
23:28:39 <strcat[m]> since people started reporting it on the stock OS
23:45:48 <strcat[m]> TEE keystore is very widely used and has all these kinds of weird little issues worked out
23:45:56 <strcat[m]> I was sanity checking absolutely everything so we were bound to find some problems
23:46:07 <strcat[m]> their key attestation sample doesn't check this
23:55:44 <poisonoushydra> Bye bye!
