00:00:43 <textmate> Is it possible to have a different password for encryption than the one you use for logging in?
00:00:50 <textmate> I feel like this is a serious issue
00:01:34 <textmate> on my laptop I will always use an easy password for logging in, and when entering territory controlled by OPFOR I turn it off to be sure, with my phone this is not the case.
00:05:37 <louipc> you can use a second profile
00:05:52 <textmate> wym
00:05:53 <textmate> ohhh
00:06:04 <textmate> And then that would have a different password
00:06:08 <textmate> thats pretty smart ngl
00:06:26 <louipc> yes you can have multiple profiles
00:06:38 <textmate> profiles or users
00:06:45 <louipc> yea
00:06:49 <textmate> users you mean?
00:07:19 <louipc> both
00:07:34 <textmate> whats the difference
00:08:01 <louipc> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
00:08:15 <textmate> ok
00:09:58 <textmate> Is there maybe some like, widget I can use to switch to a user?
00:10:30 <louipc> you slide down the top tray
00:10:41 <louipc> all the way
00:11:06 <textmate> I know
00:11:09 <textmate> a widget would be cool though
00:11:40 <textmate> because
00:11:47 <textmate> if I will use a different account as my main
00:11:57 <textmate> I might sometimes forget that I need to switch
00:15:00 <strcat[m]> set it up so they have a different background etc. then
00:15:10 <textmate> HM yeah
01:12:48 <narcoli[m]> hey guys I installed a new os ubuntu
01:13:12 <narcoli[m]> I follow the steps but I get "waiting for any device"
01:13:31 <narcoli[m]> I dl the sdk up to date fastboot
01:14:09 <narcoli[m]> what should I do to fix the "waiting for any device "problem thank you
01:14:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hi narcoli[m].
01:14:42 <TheJollyRoger> It's likely what's going on is you need to allow it through your udev rules. Give me a second and let me pull up my notes for you.
01:14:55 <narcoli[m]> my fastboot version is 30.0.5-6877874
01:15:14 <narcoli[m]> ok thanks TheJollyRoger
01:15:55 <TheJollyRoger> Great! Ok, so, udev! There are two ways we can go about this: the "sledgehammer" way is to simply run fastboot as root. This is convenient but... I don't like this, so we're going to allow udev through:
01:16:08 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to run:
01:16:10 <narcoli[m]> ok
01:17:13 <TheJollyRoger> cd ~ && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/master/51-android.rules && sudo mv 51-android.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules && sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
01:17:43 <narcoli[m]> i copy the whole line correct?
01:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> Entire line.
01:18:17 <narcoli[m]> ok one second Im running ubuntu on laptop bear with me]
01:18:20 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
01:19:39 <TheJollyRoger> Note that this won't produce any output.
01:19:45 <TheJollyRoger> (or it will produce very little)
01:20:19 <TheJollyRoger> You may need to reboot afterwards, though.
01:20:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: CTS results
01:20:47 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: sorry, it's not done yet.
01:20:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need an update on those ASAP
01:21:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: I know just how much is done rn
01:21:37 <louipc> what you cts-ing
01:21:39 <TheJollyRoger> 145h:38:19  [XXXXXXXXXXXXX]  running cts on build(s) 'DeviceBuildInfo{bid=6965179, serial=XXXXXXXXXX}'
01:21:50 <ghost_matrix[m]> narcoli can't wait till this all works for you!
01:21:50 <ghost_matrix[m]> And you running graphene OS
01:22:32 <TheJollyRoger> louipc: I ran cts "everything"
01:22:38 <narcoli[m]> 51-android.rules 100% 22.43k --.-KB/s in 0.006s
01:22:50 <narcoli[m]> > <@ghost_matrix:matrix.org> narcoli can't wait till this all works for you!
01:22:50 <narcoli[m]> > And you running graphene OS
01:22:50 <narcoli[m]> me too
01:23:10 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: ok, excellent. You may need to reboot the laptop though, but give it a try now.
01:23:11 <narcoli[m]> <narcoli[m] "51-android.rules 100% 22.43k --."> this was the last line TheJollyRoger
01:23:15 <louipc> nice
01:23:35 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger "narcoli: ok, excellent. You may "> ok rebooting now
01:25:42 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m] there a way I can send the logs of what I have to you right now?
01:27:17 <narcoli[m]> so the command I usually type that gives me the "waiting for any device" is:
01:27:27 <narcoli[m]> sudo fastboot flash unlock
01:27:37 <TheJollyRoger> Yep?
01:28:18 <narcoli[m]> 1 sec almost there
01:29:39 <narcoli[m]> same thing\
01:29:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh you were running it as root?
01:29:53 <narcoli[m]> still says "waiting for any device"
01:29:54 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment.
01:29:58 <TheJollyRoger> Is your phone plugged in and on fastboot?
01:30:05 <narcoli[m]> yes
01:30:15 <narcoli[m]> device state: locked
01:31:13 <TheJollyRoger> If it's running as root and fastboot is still not seeing it, that's not a udev permission issue then...
01:31:28 <narcoli[m]> im not on root
01:31:37 <narcoli[m]> just regular command line
01:31:40 <TheJollyRoger> if you're running it with "sudo" you're running it as root.
01:31:49 <narcoli[m]> ok
01:33:15 <narcoli[m]> what do I do in this case?
01:34:25 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to have to defer to someone more knowledgeable than I; check that the cables are plugged in and snug, the phone should be on fastboot, if this is happening still, I'm not quite sure what's going on.
01:35:35 <narcoli[m]> alright thanks for your help im going to try and get different cables maybe try that\
01:35:43 <TheJollyRoger> Good luck man!
01:35:51 <narcoli[m]> thank you!
01:51:15 <narcoli[m]> I unlocked it
01:51:27 <narcoli[m]> changed charger
01:52:53 <ghost_matrix[m]> Wooooo!!!!! narcoli
01:53:07 <ghost_matrix[m]> Your USB probs didn't support data transfer
01:53:17 <narcoli[m]> YES SO HAPPY
01:53:40 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: ha, well there's one step down!
01:53:46 <narcoli[m]> I want to make sure I dont mess up the installation
01:54:04 <narcoli[m]> just dled 4A sunfish and extracted
01:54:09 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. You're past the hardest parts though. The rest is just making sure you get the right zip file for the right device.
01:54:12 <TheJollyRoger> Great.
01:54:15 <TheJollyRoger> You're on the home stretch now.
01:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> Before you hit the almighty ./flash-all command, make sure that phone is placed flat on your desk and the cable plugged into it nice and tight so it won't fall out.
01:55:08 <TheJollyRoger> Once you start it, don't disturb the phone until it's done.
01:55:10 <narcoli[m]> its good flat ready to go
01:55:26 <narcoli[m]> what is the command I put in after extracting
01:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> it should be under the heading "flashing factory images". You'll need to cd into the directory you just unpacked, and then run "./flash-all.sh"
01:56:36 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, once you start it don't disturb the device* until it's done.
01:56:45 <ghost_matrix[m]> Lift off!
01:57:11 <narcoli[m]> right now all I did was get the zip and extracted it into my downloads folder
01:58:06 <TheJollyRoger> yep, "cd sunfish-factory-2020...". Type in "ls" and you should see some files, "flash-all.sh" should be one of them.
01:58:17 <narcoli[m]> "You'll need to cd into the directory" what is this exactly?
01:58:43 <ghost_matrix[m]> Go a level down into the directory
01:58:47 <TheJollyRoger> cd stands for "change directory." Basically, it changes your working directory from one direcotry to another.
01:59:08 <narcoli[m]> so the command I type in is cd ls?
01:59:20 <TheJollyRoger> Just type in this:
01:59:46 <TheJollyRoger> cd sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03
01:59:53 <TheJollyRoger> it will produce no output but it may change your prompt.
02:00:34 <TheJollyRoger> then type in "ls flash-all.sh" hit return, and see if you see something called "flash-all.sh" If you see it, we move onto the second-last step, which is to type "./flash-all.sh" and hit return.
02:00:53 <TheJollyRoger> Don't unplug the phone after it's done because there is one last step prior to booting.
02:01:22 <narcoli[m]> bash: cd: sunfish-factory-2020.12.03: no such file or directory
02:01:48 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: Yep, you're missing one "12"
02:02:04 <narcoli[m]> oh my mistake 1 sec
02:03:31 <encryptocat> Hi, anyone knows what the difference betweern ending seission from second profile when pressing button om lock screen en pressing power button and than select end session?
02:03:36 <narcoli[m]> same thing
02:04:07 <narcoli[m]> bash: cd: sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03: no such file or directory
02:04:33 <narcoli[m]> but I see it in my downloads folder
02:04:36 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: what cd is telling you then, is that you haven't downloaded and extracted the zip to that location.
02:04:45 <TheJollyRoger> ok, so,
02:04:51 <TheJollyRoger> We can move to that location using cd.
02:05:01 <TheJollyRoger> "cd .." will move you up one level.
02:05:29 <encryptocat> When i switch with power button and then select end session itntakes much longer to switch, screen goes black also for 30 seconds, but when i switch by selecting end session on lock screen it switches immediatly? Whats the difference?
02:05:45 <TheJollyRoger> I presume you have a directory called "Downloads" in your home diroctery. Try "cd ~/Downloads"
02:06:02 <narcoli[m]> yes its in there
02:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> Or better yet, try "cd ~/Downloads/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03"
02:06:22 <narcoli[m]> ok 1 sec
02:06:46 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: it looks like you downloaded it outside of the commandline probably using a browser, and saved it to a different location.
02:07:02 <narcoli[m]> yes off the graphene site
02:07:08 <narcoli[m]> and into download file
02:09:32 <narcoli[m]> I might be doing something wrong
02:09:37 <narcoli[m]> do I have to be in sudo?
02:09:38 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: the commands on the installation page are actually designed to be run subsequently, they produce an exact output for those given inputs. Ad-libbing, such as downloading without the use of curl will mess with the order.
02:09:42 <TheJollyRoger> No.
02:09:53 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on a moment.
02:10:40 <TheJollyRoger> I can walk you through this since I have the rest of the procedure memorized, but remember, I'm not sitting next to you, and I will be flying blind.
02:10:44 <narcoli[m]> cd~/Downloads is giving me the bash: cd~/downloads: no such file or directory
02:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> So if you deviate from my instructions, I can't help you.
02:11:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yep, you've typed it in lowercase and you're missing the spaces.
02:11:18 <TheJollyRoger> Unix and Linux is cAsE sEnSiTiVe.
02:11:27 <narcoli[m]> got it
02:11:31 <narcoli[m]> 1 sec again
02:11:44 <TheJollyRoger> cd ~/Downloads/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03
02:12:10 <narcoli[m]> ok im in downloads now
02:12:12 <TheJollyRoger> That's the exact command. Nothing more, nothing less. If you've already extracted it into your Downloads folder, then it should be there, provided you did what you say you did.
02:12:21 <TheJollyRoger> post me the output of:
02:12:26 <TheJollyRoger> pwd && ls flash-all.sh
02:13:02 <narcoli[m]> Right now I put in the command cd ~/Downloads
02:13:24 <narcoli[m]> is says ~/Downloads$
02:13:35 <TheJollyRoger> I'll start numbering steps:
02:14:04 <narcoli[m]> ok
02:14:06 <TheJollyRoger> Starting at 11: post me the output of "pwd && ls"
02:15:25 <narcoli[m]> one sec im closing terminal and starting 2 messages up
02:15:56 <TheJollyRoger> Hey dude, I'm sorry but I really can't help you if you adlib or deviate from my instructions.
02:16:11 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, I'm flying blind.
02:16:45 <TheJollyRoger> So if you adlib, or go on things your own way, you're essentially making it nearly impossible for me to help you out.
02:16:47 <narcoli[m]> understood
02:17:05 <narcoli[m]> right now my cmd line says this
02:17:34 <narcoli[m]> `/downloads/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03$
02:17:44 <narcoli[m]> thats what im in right now
02:17:59 <the5000[m]> Hello
02:18:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, great. Step twelve:
02:18:11 <TheJollyRoger> ls flash-all.sh
02:18:33 <TheJollyRoger> If it replies "flash-all.sh" then you're ready for step thirteen.
02:18:44 <narcoli[m]> it did
02:18:53 <TheJollyRoger> Last step.
02:18:56 <TheJollyRoger> ./flash-all.sh
02:19:00 <TheJollyRoger> And hold on tight!
02:19:58 <narcoli[m]> ok its working!
02:20:33 <TheJollyRoger> This may take a couple minutes. It'll let you know when it's finished. Don't disturb it until it tells you that it's done.
02:20:40 <narcoli[m]> ok
02:20:50 <TheJollyRoger> Keep the phone plugged in. Don't unplug it, because there's a crucial last step we must do.
02:21:03 <narcoli[m]> alright
02:22:37 <narcoli[m]> finished
02:22:44 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Last step:
02:22:49 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot flashing lock
02:22:52 <TheJollyRoger> Enter that and hit return.
02:22:59 <TheJollyRoger> Once you do, you'll need to confirm it on your phone.
02:23:42 <narcoli[m]> do I get out of ~/downloads/sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03$
02:23:53 <narcoli[m]> before writing that in
02:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, not at all.
02:24:08 <narcoli[m]> ok 1 sec
02:24:40 <TheJollyRoger> (also, again, don't ad lib. If you had ad libbed on any of the earlier steps, it would have thrown us both off.)
02:24:52 <TheJollyRoger> *If you had done that on any of the earlier steps
02:25:21 <TheJollyRoger> I know it seems like you're saving me work, but ad-libbing on support like this when commands and procedures are to be followed exactly always ends up causing more.
02:25:38 <narcoli[m]> what is ad libbing mean? not writing the commands correctly?
02:25:55 <TheJollyRoger> "ad-libbing" in this context, means taking liberties or improvising.
02:26:16 <TheJollyRoger> (in music, "ad lib" essentially means to freely improvise)
02:26:58 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger ""ad-libbing" in this context, me"> got it my mistake
02:27:10 <narcoli[m]> i had a guide I just a really hard time following it
02:27:34 <narcoli[m]> but now I know how to install it and I thank you for your patience
02:27:40 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
02:27:44 <TheJollyRoger> So, is the bootloader locked?
02:28:06 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger "So, is the bootloader locked?"> yup
02:28:10 <TheJollyRoger> The next time you reboot the screen, you should see a warning screen that says something like "Your phone is loading a different operating system."
02:28:23 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The next time you reboot the scr"> yes I got that
02:28:58 <TheJollyRoger> Great! That's normal and expected, it lets you know that the verified boot is on and enforcing, but you're not loading the Google operating system.
02:29:30 <TheJollyRoger> It's only if that screen turns orange though that you have to worry.
02:29:50 <organicpumpkin[m> Hey! Does being on the Beta Channel and actively participating in submitting any bugs that come up actually help?
02:29:50 <organicpumpkin[m> If so, a follow up question - is the beta channel usable as your only daily driver in your experience?
02:30:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hi organicpumpkin[m indeed it does!
02:30:34 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger "It's only if that screen turns o"> everything worked fine you were a great help
02:30:45 <TheJollyRoger> narcoli[m]: glad to hear! Welcome aboard the ship!
02:31:00 <TheJollyRoger> Don't forget to donate to help this project!
02:31:16 <narcoli[m]> thanks 😄
02:31:39 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Don't forget to donate to help t"> I wont you guys take btc?
02:31:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ye be welcome!
02:32:02 <organicpumpkin[m> <TheJollyRoger "Hi OrganicPumpkin indeed it does"> Thank you. Any thoughts on Beta's usability as a daily driver?
02:32:09 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS does take bitcoin! https://grapheneos.org/donate and also Monero.
02:32:31 <the5000[m]> Can you still get Android updates on graphene?
02:32:31 <narcoli[m]> good! I like this
02:33:06 <TheJollyRoger> organicpumpkin[m: it works fine, in my experience, although occasionally there *may* be glitches, so make sure you back up. Use Seedvault to back up your system and apps and configuration,
02:33:19 <organicpumpkin[m> <the5000[m] "Can you still get Android update"> As in the operating system updates? Yes, for the supported devices.
02:33:38 <TheJollyRoger> and back up things like your Signal database file, and such, JUST in case there's an update that is problematic.
02:34:03 <the5000[m]> I'm on Android 11 right now it says update to the latest firmware
02:34:05 <TheJollyRoger> the5000[m]: GrapheneOS was the first non-Google OS to port to Android 11.
02:34:20 <TheJollyRoger> the5000[m]: you're on the factory (Google) operating system?
02:34:25 <organicpumpkin[m> <TheJollyRoger "OrganicPumpkin: it works fine, i"> Hmmm, but does seedvault work to backup secondary user profiles? (Which I intend to use as my main one)
02:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> organicpumpkin[m: ah, haven't tried that yet.
02:34:38 <the5000[m]> Yes
02:34:47 <the5000[m]> I'm trying to get graphene but I don't know how to use powershell
02:35:16 <the5000[m]> I'm on a pixel 3
02:35:21 <TheJollyRoger> the5000[m]: Ok. The reason why we suggest you update to the latest revision of the google operating system is because the Google operating system includes updates to the firmware and bootloader that GrapheneOS assumes you will have. So what I'd probably suggest you do is connect the phone to WiFi and let it update.
02:36:10 <TheJollyRoger> The important part is the bootloader. There is a safety check in place to ensure that the bootloader is up to date, but you'll save yourself a lot more trouble if you just let the phone update to the latest revision.
02:36:31 <the5000[m]> I'm already updated to the latest
02:36:35 <TheJollyRoger> the5000[m]: using PowerShell is very similar to using a UNIX command shell.
02:36:51 <the5000[m]> I never used Unix command shell
02:37:01 <organicpumpkin[m> <TheJollyRoger "The important part is the bootlo"> Can you update to the latest version without signing into the google account?
02:38:05 <TheJollyRoger> organicpumpkin[m: yes. Or if you want you can simply download the OTA and sideload it, if you really for some reason want to do that.
02:39:19 <TheJollyRoger> One reason for this is if you have a *lot* of devices you want to all update at the same time and just want to crank them out as if they were on an assembly line.
02:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> Or if it would make you feel better about keeping the device offline until you update it.
02:40:10 <TheJollyRoger> correction: or if it would make you feel better about keeping the device offline until you install GrapheneOS on it.
02:41:02 <encryptocat> When i switch with power button and then select end session itntakes much longer to switch, screen goes black also for 30 seconds, but when i switch by selecting end session on lock screen it switches immediatly? Whats the difference?
02:41:18 <organicpumpkin[m> <TheJollyRoger "correction: or if it would make "> That was the idea. But if I can do it without signing in to a google account from within, that is what I will do.
02:41:24 <encryptocat> Anyone knows this?
02:41:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hello encryptocat, give me a bit and I'll try to get back to you.
02:41:51 <encryptocat> Ok thanx
02:42:20 <TheJollyRoger> organicpumpkin[m: yep, you can simply download the OTA and sideload it via recovery while the bootloader on the phone is locked.
02:44:16 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, encryptocat, I got a test user profile set up, let me see if I observe the same behaviour.
02:46:33 <TheJollyRoger> encryptocat: Funny, I'm observing something similar with switching profiles via End Session as well, where it returns me to a blank screen and then I have to jump out of it by hitting "back" a bit.
02:46:47 <encryptocat> Okey, from what i understand is that the only way to put your data at rest (encrypted again) is to end session from second profile. Because ending session in my google pixel 4 is different, holding power button and than select "end session" takes longer en freezes my phone for a bit, while ending session from lockscreen is smooth.
02:47:00 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try and see if this happens on the Pixel 4.
02:47:20 <encryptocat> Yeah strange, i just wanted to be sure that both ways really put my data at rest and encrypted
02:47:39 <TheJollyRoger> Odd, after I do it the second time, it doesn't reproduce this behaviour.
02:47:49 <TheJollyRoger> I'll try it a few more times.
02:48:44 <TheJollyRoger> encryptocat: it should. No clue why it took longer the first time.
02:49:16 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. It seems to be working for me after that one little bit of lag.
02:49:29 <TheJollyRoger> When my P4 is off the testing rack I'll see if I can reproduce this behaviour with that.
02:49:33 <encryptocat> My screen goes black, cant see my background every time i switch with power button, it takes 30 to 40 seconds till everything appears normal
02:49:46 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, *that* I'm definitely not seeing.
02:50:00 <TheJollyRoger> What device are you on? P4a, P4, P3, P3a?
02:50:05 <TheJollyRoger> (XL?)
02:50:08 <encryptocat> Ending session from lockscreen is smooth every time
02:50:15 <encryptocat> Pixel 4
02:50:52 <encryptocat> I have a pixel 4a also ready, going to see if there is the same
02:50:54 <encryptocat> 1 moment
02:52:02 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
02:53:21 <encryptocat> Okey my pixel4a is running smooth
02:53:27 <encryptocat> Both ways
02:53:32 <TheJollyRoger> huh. Baffling!
02:53:48 <encryptocat> But on my pixel 4a i have the admin profile empty and use the second
02:53:57 <encryptocat> And the pixel 4 is the other way around
02:54:24 <TheJollyRoger> Woah.
02:54:24 <encryptocat> But still strange that it only happens when switching with power button
02:54:30 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. That's really odd.
02:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> I'll make a note of this, and see if anyone else can reproduce this behaviour and I'll try to see if I can find the same thing on my 4.
02:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm on a 3)
02:55:25 <encryptocat> Oke thanxx
02:55:38 <encryptocat> So switching with power button or lock screen is the same
02:55:48 <encryptocat> It will logout and put data at rest
02:55:50 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If I can figure out how to reproduce it I'll open an issue on the bug tracker.
02:56:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. If the profile's logged out the encryption keys are ejected from memory and the files are set at rest.
02:56:24 <TheJollyRoger> *and its profiles are set at rest.
02:57:19 <encryptocat> Oke thanks for the help
02:57:34 <encryptocat> Loving these secondary profiles, it s a cool feature
02:58:13 <TheJollyRoger> It's an awesome feature alright!
02:58:36 <TheJollyRoger> Separate contextual identities, run multiple instances of the apps...
03:06:50 <stargazer67> Hi
03:06:59 <louipc> hello
03:07:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
03:24:42 <auto_warmbeer[m]> ok i got a pixel 4 xl
03:24:49 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i loaded the latest coral image
03:25:05 <auto_warmbeer[m]> had to load some usb driver in windows for the tools to work
03:25:26 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i'm only using windows cuz my workstation runs openbsd which isn't supported by the tools
03:25:41 <auto_warmbeer[m]> ok so...
03:25:49 <auto_warmbeer[m]> how do you load apps if there is no app store thing?
03:26:10 <louipc> download from their website
03:26:11 <whatisthematrix[> <auto_warmbeer[m] "how do you load apps if there is"> Download the fdroid apk and then you can get apps
03:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> Hi auto_warmbeer[m], you can simply sideload apps, if you can find .apks for them.
03:27:46 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that .apk files are signed and verified, and subsequent versions of the same app *must be signed* with the same private key and validated to its corresponding digital certificate used to install the previous version or the one that was pinned on first install.
03:28:22 <somenerd[m]> A TOFU (trust on first use) model
03:28:26 <TheJollyRoger> If you install the same app across multiple profiles or multiple users, it too must be the same version all across each one.
03:28:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! Trust On First Use indeed!
03:28:45 <somenerd[m]> for example, take newpipe
03:29:00 <auto_warmbeer[m]> so if I want to run the uhh, bluedriver app, or gaia gps, and i can't find apk, no bueno right?
03:29:12 <somenerd[m]> f-droid has aurora store
03:29:22 <somenerd[m]> which can install google play apps
03:29:32 <TheJollyRoger> auto_warmbeer[m]: yes, that's correct. Note that there's one caveat:
03:30:08 <Salmonoid> Hello
03:30:16 <TheJollyRoger> Apps that have a hard coded dependency on Google Play Services, and whose authors have not written them to function without google will often crash, or complain "this phone is missing Play Services, we can't run!"
03:30:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy Salmonoid!
03:30:25 <somenerd[m]> hello
03:30:30 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i found this by following thegrugq on twitter, didn't realize there was a security oriented AOSP derivative that impressively has fed back to AOSP over years
03:31:03 <auto_warmbeer[m]> ok so apps that depend on the google play API may break
03:31:10 <auto_warmbeer[m]> this is great info thank you guys
03:31:45 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i use very few apps in general
03:32:01 <auto_warmbeer[m]> most are poorly written, very unimpressive, full of ads, etc
03:32:32 <TheJollyRoger> auto_warmbeer[m]: yup, you got it! GrapheneOS considers Play Services to be invasive, so it's not included in the operating system.
03:32:32 <auto_warmbeer[m]> but i was hoping there was a decent GPS app that would save maps and stuff locally that i could run under grapheneOS
03:32:52 <TheJollyRoger> Well... there's OpenStreet Map? But I haven't used it much at all and can't offer much feedback on it.
03:32:58 <somenerd[m]> > auto_warmbeer: yup, you got it! GrapheneOS considers Play Services to be invasive, so it's not included in the operating system.
03:32:59 <somenerd[m]> as well as attack surface
03:33:00 <Urija[m]> There are no ads in F-Droid Apps.
03:33:47 <TheJollyRoger> GPS functionality and the sensors work fully on GrapheneOS, but some apps choose to instead rely on location via Play Services, rather than on the phone, since I think it's programmatically less work for them to do so.
03:33:59 <auto_warmbeer[m]> the google play store is honestly the biggest pile of shit :)
03:34:43 <TheJollyRoger> Note that without Play Services, you *need* to let the GPS calibrate before you can use it. The best way to do this is to go outside to a large, open space and take the phone for a walk so it can acquire the satellites.
03:35:14 <auto_warmbeer[m]> Ok
03:36:40 <auto_warmbeer[m]> So Google enhances GPS results through their play API with some central database and wifi scan results and whatever other heuristics I take it?
03:37:14 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure how it works, actually, someone more knowledgeable than I would need to chime in on it.
03:38:22 <Urija[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Note that without Play Services,"> Will that calibration hold or is it necessery whenever I reopen GPS-using Apps after not using GPS for a bit? It always seemed accurate enough to me, so I'm slightly confused by that advice...
03:38:29 <ayaen_t[m]> <auto_warmbeer[m] "the google play store is honestl"> not entirely googles fault if all people do is drop shit over there ,,,,
03:38:52 <auto_warmbeer[m]> not entirely, but they allow way to much trash
03:39:10 <ayaen_t[m]> yeah thats the pat where theu come in
03:39:20 <TheJollyRoger> Urija[m]: It'll hold, once it's calibrated you should be good.
03:39:25 <ayaen_t[m]> but anywasys its wayy to offtopic
03:39:32 <Salmonoid> LTE only mode is " the tits "
03:39:39 <auto_warmbeer[m]> why?
03:39:57 <auto_warmbeer[m]> the reduced attack surface is the main reason from the grapheneos.org pages
03:40:04 <Salmonoid> Yes exactly
03:40:29 <Salmonoid> Most IMSI catchers use protocol downgrade attacks
03:40:37 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i see
03:40:49 <somenerd[m]> no it's removal of legacy code
03:40:52 <Salmonoid> Jam LTE, 3g
03:41:00 <somenerd[m]> strcat has said this multiple times
03:41:06 <Salmonoid> The force phone onto fed 2g basestation
03:41:14 <TheJollyRoger> Adam####, stop it.
03:41:48 <somenerd[m]> @auto
03:42:06 <somenerd[m]> it's for removal of legacy code
03:42:16 <somenerd[m]> not to make the network trusted
03:43:13 <Salmonoid> I understand completely
03:43:23 <somenerd[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201223#c6261044
03:43:46 <TheJollyRoger> The cellphone network is security-agnostic. The best thing to do if Stingrays and IMSI catchers are on your threat model, is to simply use (and have your contacts use) an encrypted messaging app like Signal which has that threat model.
03:44:19 <TheJollyRoger> Signal is on AWS, and since a majority of smartphone backends are hosted on AWS, this provides a lot of cover traffic.
03:44:25 <Salmonoid> Yea and LTE only
03:44:38 <Salmonoid> Amazon works with fedz though
03:45:03 <TheJollyRoger> That's why Signal uses end to end encryption and runs their server backend within SGX.
03:45:12 <auto_warmbeer[m]> everybody gets paid, ya
03:45:13 <Salmonoid> Sgx?
03:45:25 <somenerd[m]> LTE only mode is not to make the network trusted
03:45:38 <somenerd[m]> it's in the faq
03:45:43 <TheJollyRoger> Software Guard Extensions - TLDR it allows Signal's server software to remain encrypted in the host memory.
03:45:54 <auto_warmbeer[m]> i am trying to turn off keyboard haptic feedback but even though there is an option that claims to cover that, it doesn't
03:45:54 <somenerd[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
03:45:56 <TheJollyRoger> *it allows data processed by Signal's server software
03:45:57 <Salmonoid> How is that possible
03:46:09 <Salmonoid> That's homomorphic encryption ??
03:46:16 <somenerd[m]> >The intention of the LTE-only feature is only hardening against remote exploitation by disabling an enormous amount of legacy code.
03:46:22 <Salmonoid> Encrypted data can work just like unencrypted data?
03:46:43 <Salmonoid> What exploits are prevented for example?
03:46:46 <TheJollyRoger> not quite. It's possible because Intel has implemented Software Guard Extensions as an anti-piracy measure.
03:46:56 <TheJollyRoger> Signal repurposed this.
03:47:00 <Salmonoid> Have unread about monomorphic encryption
03:47:08 <Salmonoid> Homo
03:47:14 <somenerd[m]> this convo is getting a bit offtopic
03:47:20 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
03:47:28 <Salmonoid> Yes
03:47:57 <TheJollyRoger> SGX is managed outside of the host. It's not Homomorphic Encryption, just something that the CPU vendor has implemented as an antipiracy measure that Signal's repurposed as a security feature.
03:59:18 <Xeon1716638> Hi
03:59:30 <ayaen_t[m]> hallo.
03:59:41 <somenerd[m]> hello
04:00:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, Salmonoid/Xeon1716638?
04:00:31 <Xeon1716638> It is I
04:02:21 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption about disk encryption
04:03:33 <strcat[m]> and https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode, https://grapheneos.org/faq#baseband-isolation, https://grapheneos.org/faq#cellular-tracking about those topics
04:03:54 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode does NOT make the cellular network secure or trustworthy
04:04:04 <Xeon1716638> Yeah I know
04:04:21 <Xeon1716638> But it improves resilience to IMSI catcher
04:04:34 <strcat[m]> no
04:05:26 * DannyWorkOrderPr *yells from back* "Gittum"
04:05:29 <strcat[m]> LTE is not a secure protocol
04:05:37 <Xeon1716638> Yes, the majority of IMSI catchers work by jamming LTE, 4g, and 3g and forcing phones onto 2g fed base stations
04:06:04 <Xeon1716638> Are full LTE MITM IMSI catchers in existence now and or possible?
04:06:08 <strcat[m]> LTE is not a secure protocol and media coverage of security issues is not accurate
04:06:45 <Xeon1716638> Alright so what's the status of LTE IMSI catchers?
04:06:57 <strcat[m]> LTE security has been publicly broken
04:07:00 <strcat[m]> it's not a secure protocol
04:07:01 <strcat[m]> that's the status
04:07:10 <Xeon1716638> OK so, what attacks are possible
04:07:29 <Xeon1716638> Full MITM, just seeing the IMSI, just radio direction finding, etc
04:07:35 <Xeon1716638> I'm just trying to learn
04:09:04 <strcat[m]> we make it clear in https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode why the feature exists
04:09:16 <Xeon1716638> Thanks
04:09:54 <strcat[m]> LTE doesn't provide secure authentication and even if it did, the network infrastructure is inherently insecure
04:10:00 <strcat[m]> shouldn't be trusting networks
04:10:04 <strcat[m]> and that is not why the feature exists
04:12:04 <Xeon1716638> So are full MITM interceptions possible on LTE?
04:12:15 <Xeon1716638> From phone to stingray to tower?
04:12:34 <TheJollyRoger> Not if you use TLS.
04:12:41 <TheJollyRoger> So use TLs.
04:12:45 <TheJollyRoger> Use apps that support TLS.
04:12:48 <Xeon1716638> Yeah I use vpns
04:12:57 <Xeon1716638> Thanks :-)
04:13:21 <TheJollyRoger> Xeon1716638/Salmonoid/Adam177whatever, I think I tell you this every time you stop by under a new alias.
04:14:01 <Xeon1716638> Yeah I'm just trying to learn beyond what I've read
04:19:54 <strcat[m]> don't use legacy calls and texts beyond bare minimum you can't avoid
04:20:24 <strcat[m]> that's all you really need to do
04:20:58 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode substantially reduces the attack surface of the OS and firmware, making it harder to exploit
04:21:16 <strcat[m]> that's why it exists
04:21:54 <strcat[m]> VoLTE calls and SMS over LTE are not secure
04:22:22 <Xeon1716638> Beautiful, an expert in his field :)
04:22:44 <strcat[m]> yes but you won't listen and you'll be back under a new nick
04:22:52 <strcat[m]> to go through the same thing again
04:22:54 <Xeon1716638> I'm listening
04:28:44 <Xeon1716638> How does LTE mode reduce firmware attack surface
04:29:10 <Xeon1716638> Is the 3G firmware, protocol itself allow remote exploitation to then implant malware onto a phone?
04:29:46 <Xeon1716638> Also, I highly reccomend the TV series Person of Interest
04:30:03 <louipc> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
04:35:36 <disjunction[m]> This is what is says on the website: "The intention of the LTE-only feature is only hardening against remote exploitation by disabling an enormous amount of legacy code."
04:41:15 <whatisthematrix[> <strcat[m] "LTE only mode substantially redu"> Does one have longer battery in LTE mode?/What are the cons to LTE only mode? Less network range?
04:44:19 <TheJollyRoger> whatisthematrix[: the lower frequency bands tend to work better in areas where cell towers are in shorter supply. Higher frequencies allow for more bandwidth and faster speeds, but the drawback is, they have significantly shorter range and can be more easily interfered with; this is why 5G has sometimes been reported to suddenly drop out if you go into a large building.
04:44:23 <Urija[m]> Not all areas have LTE coverage. In some areas you might get an older connection type, but no LTE. So LTE-only-mode basically reduces the area where you get connection.
04:45:01 <strcat[m]> it also requires that you have support for VoLTE in order to make traditional unencrypted calls
04:45:15 <strcat[m]>  * it also requires that you have support for VoLTE in order to make traditional insecure calls
04:47:39 <whatisthematrix[> Are certain bands more secure than others?
04:48:02 <strcat[m]> LTE is insecure
04:48:21 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
04:49:03 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode is attack surface reduction, that's it
04:49:27 <TheJollyRoger> whatisthematrix[: no, the cellphone network is largely security agnostic. If you need/want security, that's what TLS/SSL is for.
04:49:51 <strcat[m]> cellular networks don't provide any meaningful authentication or encryption
04:50:03 <strcat[m]> LTE only mode reduces attack surface by disabling the code handling 2G/3G in the firmware and OS
04:50:24 <strcat[m]> so there's substantially less code to exploit - and in particular, the legacy code that's poorly maintained and not as hardened or well written is disabled
04:50:41 <strcat[m]> it does NOT make the cellular network secure
04:50:49 <strcat[m]> don't know how to make this any clearer
04:51:17 <strcat[m]> and even a secure protocol (which LTE isn't) would not make it secure
04:51:41 <strcat[m]> we explain that it's important to avoid traditional calls / texts, and that includes VoLTE
05:23:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: anti piracy = sgx? Wtf
05:23:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> SGX is just a way to have the cpu encrypt a part of memory
05:24:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nothing to do with anti piracy
05:27:04 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1344508403960438784
05:27:07 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: if I recall right though, wasn't SGX originally marketed as an antipiracy feature?
05:27:11 <strcat[m]> help spread this thread
05:27:36 <strcat[m]> going to make another one about something else tied to this tomorrow
05:34:40 <louipc> twitter butchered that url you posted
05:35:07 <louipc> You can see this from the network graphs like http://github.com/GrapheneOS/pla….

08:35:38 <T34> Hi
08:36:59 <somenerd[m]> hello
08:37:21 <T34> I am trying to flash grapheneos to a pixel 4xl, but when i double click the flash all. bat it dies nothing
08:37:59 <T34> Dies needs to be does
08:38:35 <simpletech[m]> Did you follow https://grapheneos.org/install ?
08:38:42 <ayaen_t[m]> T34:  you have to open powershell and execute the command there
08:39:49 <T34> If i run the command in powershell it does nothing
08:40:12 <T34> Maybe i run the wrong command?
08:40:22 <simpletech[m]> Are you in fastboot mode?
08:40:33 <T34> Yes
08:41:10 <T34> If i do fastboot devices i see the device
08:41:58 <simpletech[m]> Double-check if you got the adb tools inside your folder, and that you enabled OEM unlocking
08:42:56 <T34> Check
08:44:03 <simpletech[m]> <T34 "Maybe i run the wrong command?"> What did you run where? You run Windows, right? Or Linux?
08:44:26 <simpletech[m]> Hmmm
08:45:11 <T34> Windows
08:46:12 <T34> ./flash-all.bat this command in powershell

08:51:48 <simpletech[m]> I've got a 4a, that's why. You're right
08:52:14 <disjunction[m]> The Pixel 4a is sunfish, the Pixel 4 is coral, and the Pixel 4XL is flame.

08:58:01 <somenerd[m]> it's too new? unsupported ig
08:59:04 <simpletech[m]> unlikely, this release was two months ago
08:59:37 <T34> Fastboot too new you mean?
09:01:21 <disjunction[m]> 30.0.5 is the latest version, it shouldn't be too old
09:01:42 <T34> Wait a minute
09:01:53 <T34> I read it wrong

11:38:23 <ayaen_t[m]> theOne: you can use the auditor app as detailed in the official instructions to male sure you are using a genuine grapheneOS image if thats what concerns you.

11:40:09 <rickza[m]> Good day all, if i may ask, what could possibly be blocking my phone from receiving calls at times ? I am using the Pixel 3a however i am getting complaints that my number is mostly unreachable but i do have signal at these times, could it possibly be the phone services that are battery optimized ?
11:46:48 <ayaen_t[m]> may be ita got to do something with your carrier
11:53:10 <rickza[m]> I take it theres no settings i can change then ?
12:04:03 <nscnt> rickza[m]: What's your carrier?
12:05:50 <rickza[m]> VodacomSA
12:09:29 <rickza[m]> anyway to disable 4g calling ?
12:10:49 <wayne_kerr[m]> setting up 4a-  need opinions:  Bromite vs. Vanadium?  I like the ad blocking in Bromite, but hear Vanadium is more secure. Go with one? Both?  Also want to manage attack surface if possible.
12:11:20 <Thatcher[m]> Vanadium all the way
12:11:43 <somenerd[m]> both for compartmentalization
12:11:44 <Liakdeuser[m]> <wayne_kerr[m] "setting up 4a-  need opinions:  "> Could be one in a user, another in another user profile, but I'd prefer Vanadium as it blends with other Chrome-Pixel users
12:11:54 <nscnt> offtopic
12:12:33 <Liakdeuser[m]> Yeah, just a quick answer, offtopic for details btw
12:12:38 <somenerd[m]>  * both for compartmentalization (but really depends)
12:12:47 <wayne_kerr[m]> quick answer

12:27:11 <nicknower[m]> Hi, so I'm thinking of switching to grapheneos. What's the best device to get for it and least likely to run into support issues in the future?
12:27:22 <uhzykydori[m]> yeah i also recommend using Vanadium, use what's installed by default
12:27:42 <ayaen_t[m]> nicknower: 4 4xl 4a

12:28:20 <ayaen_t[m]> uhzykydori: samsung users plug your ears and run far away ! lol
12:29:32 <nicknower[m]> Alright thx
12:38:46 <ayaen_t[m]> <ayaen_t[m] "uhzykydori: samsung users plug y"> btw i meant this for you saying use default browser
12:38:56 <ayaen_t[m]> and samsunnnnnnng
12:39:24 <Liakdeuser[m]> <uhzykydori[m] "yeah i also recommend using Vana"> Only applies at GrapheneOS
12:41:18 <ayaen_t[m]> yes

16:18:35 <narcoli[m]> I just downloaded fdroid loving graphene so far
16:19:03 <narcoli[m]> is there a way to verify these are from the legit developers and not a backdoor exit scam?
16:19:41 <pumpkineater69[m> You can verify the f-droid apk.
16:20:31 <narcoli[m]> alright thanks
16:23:15 <rheaalleen[m]> If you downloaded from the page and it shows with https you are perfectly, verfiy is nice but in most cases for peace of mind
16:23:51 <narcoli[m]> yeah im a little new to this I want to learn how to verify
16:24:32 <rheaalleen[m]> Always good to know/do
16:26:06 <Kurai> narcoli[m]: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps#Verifying_apk_files_and_apps
16:26:45 <narcoli[m]> <Kurai "narcoli: https://hub.libranet.de"> thanks will check this out
16:39:59 <pixel5user> can i user grapheneos on google pixel 5?
16:40:25 <pixel5user> If anyone could help it would be appreciated
16:40:46 <dakotah[m]> I don't think it is supported. Don't see it on the site
16:41:17 <narcoli[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases
16:41:25 <narcoli[m]> pixel5 is not listed
16:42:05 <pixel5user> oh no, do you think that will change? as all other models are supported
16:47:47 <rheaalleen[m]> Its fresh on the market, maybe in the future
16:47:57 <rheaalleen[m]> Also its the highest end modwl
16:51:26 <uhzykydori[m]> <narcoli[m] "is there a way to verify these a"> Offtopic but you can also verify with VirusTotal or ApkScan
16:55:12 <uhzykydori[m]> <pixel5user "If anyone could help it would be"> Actually you can help getting faster by building graphene for it
16:55:22 <ayaen_t[m]> pixel5user: still looking for someone who wants to maintain pixel 5 you see its a three year job or bowever long the device gets updates
16:56:09 <ayaen_t[m]> <uhzykydori[m] "Actually you can help getting fa"> if someones up for it ...please dont hide your superpowers!
16:58:04 <uhzykydori[m]> If I had the money to buy it I probably could
16:58:12 <uhzykydori[m]> but I only have sargo and sunfish
16:59:01 <narcoli[m]> <uhzykydori[m] "Offtopic but you can also verify"> gotcha thanks
17:00:34 <pixel5user> someone musy have superpowers to give me a custom os i can use on the pixel 5
17:03:50 <chris42> @pixel5user You can build AOSP for the Pixel 5 without problems.
17:04:25 <ayaen_t[m]> pixel5user: i feel sad for your situation but you know what try building aosp or stick to the stock if you care about security
17:05:05 <chris42> Some people are working on the Pixel 5, however so far only for the vendor blob. I understood, that kernel work etc. in Graphene is not on the priority list, as there are other more pressing issues
17:05:43 <Kvuj[m]> odd, I would have imagined an official port of LineageOS for it but no.
17:12:58 <pixel5user> Chris42, what is an AOSP?
17:13:41 <Urija[m]> Android Open Source Project
17:14:20 <pixel5user> oh sorry, where would i begin with that, Im out my depth here
17:14:31 <chris42> Android Open Source Project... it is the "original" or "base" Android... if you don't know that, you probably should expect a steep learning curve if you try to compile ;-D
17:14:35 <Urija[m]> The basic Android all other ROMs and the standard Google Android are based on.
17:17:56 <pixel5user> Chris42 you said some are working on the pixel 5, who is that?
17:17:59 <chris42> If you have never build any Android, you should probably try reading up on the android guide (https://source.android.com/setup)... getting your build environment ready, trying a few builds etc.
17:18:08 <pixel5user> i would like to follow their progress
17:19:33 <chris42> however if you just want to use a ROM, probably better to look around on XDA. I have seen a few people publishing ROMS.
17:21:16 <Liakdeuser[m]> Not really recommending that though
17:21:27 <chris42> Some people are working on creating a proper vendor preparation. There is a PR in AOSPAlliance on github and Flex1911 on github did similar work.
17:21:45 <Liakdeuser[m]> Kinda drifting away though, unsure if they need a maintainer for that
17:21:59 <Liakdeuser[m]> So far never heard of Pixel 5/4a 5G maintainer for GrapheneOS
17:22:26 <Liakdeuser[m]> * Kinda drifting away though (on your message about custom ROMs)
17:22:26 <Liakdeuser[m]> ...unsure if they need a maintainer for that
17:22:47 <chris42> @Liakdeuser Yes, as said before so far only vendor blob work... There is no maintainer in graphene currently
17:26:24 <pixel5user> Liakdeuser & Chris42 thanks for your information guys, i suppose i will have to be patient. if you know any other sites i can poke around in i would be greatful
17:28:49 <chris42> @pixel5user probably good to watch the LineageOS news sites as well. They started to pick up more google phones. However until they do the Pixel 5, it will take quite a while...
17:31:05 <pixel5user> what is a maintainer?
17:32:25 <somenerd[m]> They build GrapheneOS for the phone they maintan
17:33:32 <Liakdeuser[m]> A developer that build, maintain the OS and solves issues and figures out solution to provide a production-ready OS support as long as the device is supported upstream
17:34:25 <Liakdeuser[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=maintainer&ch=grapheneos&n=strcat%5Bm%5D
19:56:37 <rheaalleen[m]> I embedd covers of songs in the mp3 when using YouTube-dl however every cover (from epubs too) ends up in the images root folder, any way I can prevent this?
20:21:27 <Iwillpay> Can I make a cash donation that will help get GrapheneOs supported on the Pixel 5
20:22:30 <ayaen_t[m]> Iwillpay:  im sure donations are appreciated but
20:23:40 <ayaen_t[m]> the thing is we need a maintainer whod put in the time to not just build grapheneos for the pixel 5 but also you know sticks around to hear about bugs and goes to work on em
20:24:57 <ayaen_t[m]> i mean such a person will have to go up and down the source code to resolve bugs
20:25:23 <ayaen_t[m]> you see the perrson maintains that device till end of support
20:25:28 <Iwillpay> I understand, where can I find these wonderful people?
20:25:45 <ayaen_t[m]> they have to show up
20:27:03 <ayaen_t[m]> if you know someone who has the mindset and willing to put in the work and make him buy a pixel 5 that would be better than donation but ofcourse donations are greatly appreciated too
20:27:47 <Iwillpay> I will buy anyone willing to put in the work a pixel 5 and big fat wet kiss
20:29:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Iwillpay: pixel 5 is ready already
20:29:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are other issues in the OS we need to solve first
20:30:00 <ayaen_t[m]> like ?
20:30:08 <Iwillpay> anupritaisno1 - really?
20:30:17 <lodtank> just a stupid question: is there something like siri & co for graphene? like hosting the suitable software on your own server?
20:34:51 <Iwillpay> anupritaisno1 - Are you saying I can put GrapheneOs on the pixel 5? Where can I support you beautiful people.
20:38:05 <grapheneos_user_> <Iwillpay "anupritaisno1 - Are you saying I"> Your username goes well with your intentions ;)
20:39:51 <Iwillpay> I will do more than that
21:51:59 <ruddo[m]> <Iwillpay "I will do more than that"> Name a contribution below US$10000, I will match it.
21:52:34 <ruddo[m]> Conditional on there being more than just P5 support.  There needs to be a structural improvement of the project.
21:59:37 <louipc> ruddo[m]: do you have any suggestions?
22:01:11 <louipc> I think we need to grow the community, but I'm unsure how to do that.
23:15:14 <fo98[m]> I just installed Ubuntu and trying to learn the terminal, I'm following the Install | GrapheneOS instructions and the terminal says I should write "sudo apt-get install" but the instructions don't specify that. When I try what the terminal suggests it's not working too.
23:29:21 <fo98[m]> In the standalone platform-tools section, it seems like it's devided in 3 sections, do I have to copy everything or just one at a time? Also, I don't know what is <package-name> in terminal, should I paste what I'm trying to download in there, between < and >?
23:30:34 <XenoProteins12> Hello
23:30:54 <XenoProteins12> So I have a Question
23:31:27 <XenoProteins12> I read that the NSA can locate phones, even while off, how do you guys theorize the NSA can locate phones while off?
23:31:40 <XenoProteins12> Baseband vuln? Firmware exploit while phone is off, fake off state etc?
23:31:56 <XenoProteins12> Firmware exploit while phone is on, leading to a fake off state*
23:33:38 <louipc> hi. That discussion is best had elsewhere, but as far as I know it's like a fake off, low power state
23:34:07 <XenoProteins12> So how does the phone get infected in the first place?
23:35:54 <louipc> maybe someone knows in #grapheneos-offtopic, or elsewhere
23:59:27 <Essjay[m]> <fo98[m] "In the standalone platform-tools"> Do it one at a time
23:59:53 <Essjay[m]> And I recommend the stand alone tools personally
