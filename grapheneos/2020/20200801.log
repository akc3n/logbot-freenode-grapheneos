03:54:21 <BallMonokuma[m]> is it just me or did the chat name change to Nee#3508 and 1022 others
04:00:47 <Qwexi[m]> Maybe just you, but I've seen that happen a few times. I think it might either be a bug or it's just loading the room name and room image.
04:02:35 <BallMonokuma[m]> what room is tjis again?
04:02:47 <Qwexi[m]> The GrapheneOS room
04:02:56 <BallMonokuma[m]> ah ok
04:03:39 <Qwexi[m]> If it's bugged out you can always leave and rejoin the room or reload riot/element

04:16:54 <aeonsolution[m]> Been thinking about it in terms of GrapheneOS and imagining what it would be like on a desktop machine
04:23:05 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: did you see Daniel's comments?
04:24:06 <aeonsolution[m]> i did, yes! it was cool stuff, its good to get a baseline for where things stands.
04:25:26 <aeonsolution[m]> i'm still fairly new to linux security, so being able to get that down helps me between good security and noise

05:47:53 <faxing[m]> (I don't mean that in any whatever way, I'm just genuinely asking)
05:47:58 <cn3m[m]> <faxing[m] "You seem like really into privac"> privacy haven't found a better solution

05:57:42 <faxing[m]> Yeah, I suppose you're right
05:57:48 <faxing[m]> Thanks for your answer!
06:01:37 <cn3m[m]> of course the longer answer is I have a lot of experience with mobile OSes and I am more confident with the design of iOS from a technical perspective than anything else
06:14:48 <theultron[m]> Is Daniel here? I have a question regarding the auditor app.
06:15:11 <aeonsolution[m]> you should post the question, maybe someone can help
06:15:23 <aeonsolution[m]> if not try again at a earlier time
06:16:52 <theultron[m]> It's not related to GrapheneOS actually. I see the auditor app supports my device Xiaomi POCO F1. Auditor App throws up error "Device is not one of the supported models with hardware based attestation".
06:17:17 <cn3m[m]> Technically Auditor is a GrapheneOS related project
06:17:47 <aeonsolution[m]> can you post the error
06:17:57 <theultron[m]> "Device is not one of the supported models with hardware based attestation".

06:28:57 <theultron[m]> Thank you very much. I appreciate your help. :)
06:30:07 <aeonsolution[m]> you're welcome, if you don't have a github account you can email that project, the details are here <https://attestation.app/contact>
06:47:50 <theultron[m]> So do you guys manually verify using Auditor every few weeks or does it support automated verification from remote server?
07:13:32 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "So do you guys manually verify u"> remote attestation is the way to go
07:14:13 <cn3m[m]> if someone gets a root exploit there is nothing preventing them from installing and enabling an accessibility service to spy on everything you do and control your interface

08:43:26 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Just noticed something, AOSP doesn't allow to change the shape of icons?
08:43:41 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Not a big deal though,just asking if it's normal
08:48:53 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "Just noticed something, AOSP doe"> Are you talking about the default launcher app found in AOSP?
08:49:05 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Yeah
08:51:30 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Well, this is supposed to be a minimal launcher app, so I guess you need to choose a different launcher, like Lawnchair. (although, it looks like the 1.x version present on F-Droid has a buggy icon shape changer, since it doesn't work for me)
08:51:55 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Nah, I don't mind. Just asking if it's normal
09:40:26 <cdesai> They just don't have that enabled by default in aosp
09:40:29 <cdesai> But the code is present
09:52:52 <dazinism> theultron: guessing there are different models of your phone and auditor doesnt yet include the  for your model

10:14:49 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <anupritaisno1[m] "Doubt "> wdym
10:16:44 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I am a little confused, isn't GrapheneOS technically a "better" solution for some?
10:16:50 <za_warudo-vilfp8> on privacy
10:17:16 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Maybe will be, but not so much features and mitigation-wise
10:17:33 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is great for privacy
10:17:43 <cn3m[m]> I just can't use it for a PC so I use an iPad
10:17:49 <cn3m[m]> which is also fantastic
10:18:01 <cn3m[m]> I don't have a strong preference between the platforms
10:20:24 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I somehow see where you are coming from, especially with the improvements in iOS 14 (dont know if this applies in iPadOS), along with some catchup needs to be done by Android (ipc, indicators, one-time permissions, and the shaming campaigns done on ads, background processes)
10:21:16 <za_warudo-vilfp8> privacy has no better solutions as of now, maybe this is true now for OS, and other privacy-related aspects (like Signal, ugh...)
10:21:52 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Signal was a let down and disappointing, but that's off-topic
10:22:51 <cn3m[m]> Android has some advantages, like a little better clipboard controls(in someways worse in others), it also has profiles(currently super inconvenient). Also AOSP doesn't have as many connections home(partly due to no central servers and also due to less features)
10:23:03 <cn3m[m]> but generally speaking yes
10:26:10 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <cn3m[m] "Android has some advantages, lik"> Agreed with the pros and cons, and Daniel's comment on GrapheneOS vs iOS still stands now
10:26:57 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Agreed with the pros and cons, and Daniel's comment on GrapheneOS vs iOS before still stands now
10:27:42 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Android has better VPN handling and anti-leaking
10:27:46 <za_warudo-vilfp8> afaik
10:35:01 <cn3m[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "Android has better VPN handling "> eh it is complicated, but iOS is slightly ahead right now
10:37:42 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Guess I was a little misinformed, but both have leaks idk
10:37:51 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Guess I was a little misinformed, but both can have leaks idk
10:38:02 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Android apps know your real IP?
10:44:00 <cn3m[m]> yume_gaaru-vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a: so iOS used to have a WebRTC leak and there are some issues that could effect Onion Browser(but they have mitigations just don't run the lowest security level iirc). Pretty much everything is fixed
10:44:25 <cn3m[m]> Android there are several ways it can happen, but if you are blocking all connections and only using that feature in one profile you are fine
10:52:50 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Guess both are fine by now
10:54:23 <cn3m[m]> yeah imo they are
10:54:28 <cn3m[m]> neither are perfect, but hey
10:56:17 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Yeah, multiple profile vpn blocking is ideal but we aren't there
10:56:23 <za_warudo-vilfp8> yet...
10:56:33 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Almost though, the code didn't really got it
11:00:35 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Almost though, the code didn't really got it (referring to 2020.04.22 VPN lockdown not fully working)
11:12:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Actually that code wasn't right
11:12:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> We wanted to do lockdown when always on VPN was enabled
11:12:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> That code ignored the always on VPN
11:12:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> And just enabled lockdown
11:24:22 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I assume it's a little more complicated than changing few lines on the code right?
16:41:24 <broda721[m]> For some reason, f droid wont install on my 4th user profile. It installed flawlessly from the other three profiles. Whenever i start the apk install via browser / downloads / filemanager, it says 'app not installed' at the end. I suspect it to be a signing issue, but i dont understand how/why. Same error from Bromite/Vanadium. Installing Bromite via apk was no issue
16:41:25 <broda721[m]> What could it be?

18:35:22 <pixelusus> don't profiles share the apks as they do for work profile?
18:42:16 <broda721[m]> Not as far as im concerned. I had 3 different f droid installs for the three earlier profiles, went buttersmooth
18:42:24 <broda721[m]> Just this forth one wont install it
18:42:46 <broda721[m]> Unless im doing it horribly wrong
18:42:58 <broda721[m]> But i just basicly do a whole new setup with app installs etc for each profile
18:49:39 <internetshogun[m> Kind of a dumb question but it sort of pertains to this since my phones on Graphene. Anyone know if the Steam Guard authenticator in the app requires GSF to show properly?
18:51:48 <internetshogun[m> nvm figured it out :^)
