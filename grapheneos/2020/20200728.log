00:52:36 <jfbourdeau> Hi everyone, I am trying to use my Pixel 3a GraphenOS phone as a HotSpot and I can't figure out why it's not working.  My Laptop can connect to the phone, can ping the phone but can't surf... As i the phone was not allowing it to access internet.  I tried turning Off the VPN on the phone but it doesn't solve my problem.  Any idea ?
00:52:58 <jfbourdeau> It did work in the past and I can't pipoint why it's not working anymore
01:05:41 <izymandias[m]> where can i read about vanadium? searched reddit, cant find anything

02:05:29 <thunderbiscuit[m> still here. But goddammit can this software piss me off. I can't believe how unintuitive it is, and how the docs are... subpar.
02:05:41 <cn3m[m]> matrix or irc?
02:05:46 <cn3m[m]> or both
02:05:51 <thunderbiscuit[m> I'm on it all right now haha
02:05:58 <thunderbiscuit[m> Matrix muuuuuuch better.
02:06:08 <thunderbiscuit[m> But some of the channels I need are not bridged.
02:06:20 <thunderbiscuit[m> So I need vanilla IRC to work.

02:10:27 <thunderbiscuit[m> ok so let's say there is this channel I wish to get on Matrix. Let us say that I am using the latest Element client.
02:11:05 <overheadscallop[> Apparently the element mobile app can't join irc bridge channels... Try the desktop/web app?
02:11:06 <thunderbiscuit[m> When I search the channel using the UI, it's not there. say #android-root

02:13:42 <geritol[m]> aeonsolution: okay thanks no way to get the old ones?
02:13:47 <thunderbiscuit[m> I'm trying to find out if I can build aosp for the Pinephone.

02:14:27 <ghostcat[m]> thunderbiscuit: Using a Graphene OS build?
02:14:31 <thunderbiscuit[m> All right so I'm being kicked out of the room instantly. How do I identify myself before?
02:14:36 <aeonsolution[m]> Pixel 1 family didn't have GrapheneOS as far as i know
02:14:41 <thunderbiscuit[m> ghostcat:
02:15:07 <thunderbiscuit[m> no well I'd love to just wrap my head around building vanilla aosp to start.
02:15:18 <thunderbiscuit[m> I think my mental model is incomplete.
02:15:31 <geritol[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "Pixel 1 family didn't have Graph"> The guys at Copperhead said they could hook me up with one. Which is based on GrapheneOS. They just said they weren't sure when
02:16:09 <cn3m[m]> geritol: I would recommend Lineage over Copperhead. Pixel 1 had a GrapheneOS build, but it is EOL
02:16:15 <cn3m[m]> The stock is better than both
02:16:18 <aeonsolution[m]> geritol: I wouldn't trust those people. They are selling you an unsecure, unpatched OS
02:16:33 <aeonsolution[m]> I second cn3m
02:16:54 <geritol[m]> Okay thanks :(
02:17:09 <thunderbiscuit[m> Here's what I have so far... sorry for the nooby diagrams in this chat of very advanced ROM peeps...
02:17:12 <ghostcat[m]> thunderbiscuit: Nice little project but why are you trying to get info on this in Graphene OS room?
02:17:26 * thunderbiscuit[m uploaded an image: android-3-architectures.png (97KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/jSzKVlFlEPnRxhRgtXqfqVVn >
02:18:12 <thunderbiscuit[m> Man I just don't know where to go! Plus no one else is talking on any of the other channels, and you guys started asking questions. So I just thought it was a good place to start... haha
02:18:42 <aeonsolution[m]> geritol: please check this out https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
02:18:57 <thunderbiscuit[m> And the answer is yes we do have binary blobs for the Pinephone I found that out yesterday.
02:18:58 <aeonsolution[m]> or follow cn3m advice to use LineageOS
02:19:16 <aeonsolution[m]> but there are a lot of compromises you are making on security that you should weigh
02:19:25 <ghostcat[m]> thunderbiscuit: This mainly about Graphene OS as a whole this channel but we do have an off-topic room if you want in.
02:19:31 <aeonsolution[m]> this group would be happy to answer them
02:20:29 <aeonsolution[m]> so if you got questions let us know!
02:20:39 <thunderbiscuit[m> Yes well that or another place you'd recommend! ghostcat
02:20:59 <thunderbiscuit[m> where do you go to chat basic vanilla aosp?
02:21:28 <ghostcat[m]> thunderbiscuit: Off topic room or I have a whole another room for that.
02:21:52 <thunderbiscuit[m> Also cn3m  your link... I think it works but I get kicked out immediately... do you have any idea why this is happening? I assume I need to register somehow?
02:22:26 <thunderbiscuit[m> Sounds good ghostcat ! Hook me up with both.
02:24:33 <overheadscallop[> <thunderbiscuit[m "Also cn3m  your link... I think "> the IRC side might be configured to disallow matrix clients
02:24:56 <thunderbiscuit[m> Aaah I see.

02:26:33 <ghostcat[m]> thunderbiscuit: https://matrix.to/#/!NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org

02:32:58 <thunderbiscuit[m> cn3m: your trick worked. Cheers man. Huge help.
03:16:34 <Knull[m]> I ran the 60hz commands, it's not better. It's probably more noticeable?
03:16:49 <Knull[m]> It didn't break anything

04:38:55 <pacobell[m]> Try the latest build on GitHub. Worked for me.
04:39:00 <ghostcat[m]> It is a problem with NewPipe and Invidious in general.
04:40:58 <ghostcat[m]> pacobell: New release that hasn't hit F-droid yet. Makes sense.
04:42:21 <ghostcat[m]> After every new release NewPipe just stops working most of the time.
04:46:04 <Knull[m]> GitHub one same issue, but yeah it's a couple versions newer
04:46:40 <ghostcat[m]> Knull: So wait and use an alternative for now.

06:27:40 <anonhat[m]> I suspect youtube's notorious habit of meddling with the ability of third party players actually accessing their content has something to do with it.

07:24:54 <renlord> cant really fault YT for doing what they are suppose to do

08:47:22 <Harana> Hi is there someone able to make VirtualXposed works in grapheneos? I am able to install it, but I can't launch any app.
08:48:03 <cn3m[m]> <Harana "Hi is there someone able to make"> what are you trying to accomplish?
08:53:57 <Harana> I have some applications that requires the GMS to work, I tested VirtualXposed in lineageos with microg and it was working. I am trying to do the same thing in Grapheneos
08:57:25 <anonhat[m]> Oh my god. I just read Daniel's justifications for not wanting to take legal action against Copperhead/James and they don't make any sense. Even if he doesn't want to take legal action, free publicity from spreading the story to LegalEagle and other online legal social accounts is a good idea if he wants more support. And his notion that the legal system is corrupt just because James and Company found a way to dupe it
08:57:25 <anonhat[m]> is the epitome of mental retardation.
08:58:01 <anonhat[m]>  * Edit: Moved to off-topic.
09:12:33 <Harana> any idea about my previous question?

14:17:36 <clannad[m]> > tested today by setting refresh rate to 5, definitively not running at 5hz...
14:17:36 <clannad[m]> You can only set the refresh rate to what the kernel permits
14:17:59 <clannad[m]> There are only 2 display timings the kernel knows of

15:22:02 <test8790[m]> Hey guys is there's a simple tutorial to install Graphene on my phone
15:24:28 <overheadscallop[> There is only one recommended guide, the official one: https://grapheneos.org/install
15:36:04 <switchdominion[m> <test8790[m] "Hey guys is there's a simple tut"> Just make sure to follow the directions. Just from lurking here for a bit, one problem people run into with the directions is they run curl to download the images but then go to their Downloads folder and try to install from there. If you just opened a terminal/powershell window, then it's likely your working directory is your users root directory e.g.
15:36:04 <switchdominion[m> /home/username or C:\Users\Username. Make sure you run all the commands in the same directory.
15:37:36 <switchdominion[m> Another problem is people sometimes add fastboot to their PATH multiple times or they'll add it to their PATH, close the terminal or start a new session, and forget to add it again.
15:39:44 <switchdominion[m> You'll probably have an easier time running the installation on a Linux OS. I don't think signify is built for windows but it can be compiled with MinGW.
15:50:59 <Knull[m]> idk what I did when I ran mine but I had to edit the flash-all.bat to replace all fastboot references to ./fastboot 🤷‍♂️

20:02:45 <nickcalyx[m]> 💯
20:09:45 <strcat[m]>  don't understand what that was about
20:10:01 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem like some random troll that just joined the channel to spam racist bs
20:10:17 <strcat[m]> dunno how long they were here
20:10:18 <strcat[m]> oh well
20:13:00 <SchismXL[m]> They've been doing it in a few other rooms I'm in, too. Who knows? Anyways, they're gone now. Let's get back to normality :)
20:13:14 <aeonsolution[m]> agreed
20:24:17 <l0ngr0ns1lv3r[m]> SchismXL: hey there, next try
20:27:34 <SchismXL[m]> ?
20:28:04 <LRS> sry, i'm new on irc/matrix, its me
20:28:36 <SchismXL[m]> Ah, nice! "Borrowed" a cable from work?
20:28:59 <LRS> i'll bring it back ;)
20:29:35 <LRS> and i think, that i will try some other machines, in case of failing
20:29:52 <SchismXL[m]> Crossing fingers this'll work for you tonight
20:30:41 <LRS> hope so... lets check the prequesites
20:30:50 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "and i think, that i will try som"> Also "borrowed" from work? Lol.
20:31:24 <LRS> work, family and now another try, a little tired but not borrowed
20:32:18 <LRS> if it fails i will try my desktop majaro, and if this fails i will try my win pc
20:32:23 <LRS> +n
20:34:09 <LRS> i resetted the system, after it failed yesterday, now it has the status like before, except the bootloader isn't locked
20:34:13 <SchismXL[m]> I've had luck on Pop, Ubuntu and Linux Mint, too. It is recommended to use the most up to date version of the OS, too
20:34:28 <LRS> let me check
20:34:47 <LRS> up to date
20:34:50 <SchismXL[m]> Get Ubuntu 20.04 and make a Live USB just in case
20:35:16 <LRS> it works on live distr.?
20:35:46 <SchismXL[m]> Don't see why it wouldn't
20:36:34 <LRS> cause everything is handled via usb? thought that might be an error source, but i will give it a try
20:36:54 <LRS> but first the new cable
20:37:11 <LRS> better said old
20:37:18 <SchismXL[m]> Aye, let's not jump the gun. Start simple then we can troubleshoot
20:38:04 <LRS> you are right, lets check before
20:39:33 <LRS> udev: ls -l /etc/udev/rules.d/
20:39:33 <LRS> insgesamt 24
20:39:33 <LRS> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 22305 27. Jul 23:38 51-android.rules
20:39:57 <blacktwig[m]> <cn3m[m] "PWAs are uniquely isolated if th"> Interesting interesting. This may lead to off-topic territory, but is something similar true on desktop Chromium? Are PWAs more isolated than just websites are?
20:40:39 <cn3m[m]> <blacktwig[m] "Interesting interesting. This ma"> it is the same as regular tabs on both
20:42:14 <LRS> oem unlock check
20:42:15 <LRS> usb debugging on check
20:42:19 <blacktwig[m]> <cn3m[m] "so what you are thinking of is w"> Could you elaborate? I'm trying to formulate a more specific question but honestly I think I know too little about what all websites can and can't do to do so.
20:42:46 <cn3m[m]> read the usage guide for GrapheneOS it covers the flaws with webview
20:42:59 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "usb debugging on check"> Don’t forget to do the platform tools working directory thing, too
20:43:15 <LRS> right, thanks
20:43:54 <LRS> check
20:45:24 <blacktwig[m]> cn3m: Oh, okay thanks for the straightforward answer. I've tried digging into the Chromium docs to figure out how much tabs are isolated (and in the process learn the various ways websites can interact) so I guess I'll continue to do so
20:45:31 <blacktwig[m]> <cn3m[m] "read the usage guide for Graphen"> Ok will do
20:45:53 <cn3m[m]> <blacktwig[m] "cn3m: Oh, okay thanks for the st"> Yeah, it is more of an Android thing than a Chromium thing
20:46:10 <cn3m[m]> Chromium docs cover what tabs are isolated with site isolation(which is not a thing on WebView)
20:46:32 <cn3m[m]> WebView runs as one big sandbox too which is not ideal
20:47:10 <cn3m[m]> Vanadium WebView is quite hardened though so in some cases a browser like DuckDuckGo could be more secure than Bromite shockingly
20:47:20 <cn3m[m]> that is GrapheneOS only of course
20:47:38 <cn3m[m]> normal webview is not nearly as good as Bromite dedicated browser
20:47:43 <cn3m[m]> Bromite's webview isn't good either
20:47:54 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "check"> Okay, so it seems like you’ve got everything in order. Just signify again, just in case and see if all the files are okay. Next is to just run through the flash-all.sh. Maybe do bash flash-all.sh (it shouldn’t make a difference, but it hasn’t failed when I type bash first).
20:48:24 <LRS> ok i will do
20:48:51 <ideepolizei[m]> what do you guys think of Google replacing jemalloc with scudo? They say that (in internal testing) they found security and stability bugs that they didn't detect before.Scudo for example lists use after free, arbitrary free, double free and heap based buffer overflow as things it was designed to detect.
20:48:51 <ideepolizei[m]> Since GrapheneOS uses hardened malloc,I assume it detects and is designed to counter a lot of the same memory bugs. What separates the two memory allocators i.e. what mitigations do you guys think they should adopt that graphene provides already since they do acknowledge that it doesn't fully prevent exploitation.

20:55:11 <LRS> @SchismXL it is sending the sparse, YEAH!!!
20:55:21 <blacktwig[m]> <cn3m[m] "WebView runs as one big sandbox "> That's a helpful picture
20:55:35 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "@SchismXL it is sending the spar"> Oh yes!
20:56:04 <LRS> its finshed, i will lock and reboot
20:56:06 <SchismXL[m]> Must’ve been that cable
20:56:08 <ghostcat[m]> Alright I disabled my camera on GOS yet it can scan QR codes. Is this by default?
20:56:33 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "its finshed, i will lock and reb"> 🍆💦💦💦
20:56:54 <blacktwig[m]> cn3m: Ah okay those 1.5 new-ish paragraphs on the GrapheneOS site are interesting. The phrase "Network Isolation Keys" got me to a Google Doc called the "Storage Isolation Project" by a chromium dev so hopefully that should answer more of my questions. Thanks again
20:57:44 <cn3m[m]> Chromium is doing some excellent work behind the scense
20:57:49 <cn3m[m]>  * Chromium is doing some excellent work behind the scenes
20:58:04 <cn3m[m]> you know Chromium though, very methodical
20:58:16 <cn3m[m]> they rather not do something than do it wrong
21:01:00 <ghostcat[m]> Does disabling the camera software cancel out the QR reader?
21:06:00 <LRS> @SchismXL: thanks a lot for helping, changing the cable was the trick. thank you very much, exspecially for your endurance
21:07:13 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "@SchismXL: thanks a lot for help"> If only I had the endurance for the right things 😓
21:07:18 <SchismXL[m]> You're welcome btw
21:08:26 <LRS> youre the best, all the best 4 you!!!
21:08:43 <SchismXL[m]> Take care :)
21:09:45 <LRS> i will, lets get facebook, whatsapp and all the stuff...
21:09:45 <LRS> just kidding ;)
21:10:14 <blacktwig[m]> <cn3m[m] "Chromium is doing some excellent"> Yea it seems like it. A link to a post about the "Privacy Sandbox" initiative talks about third-party cookie handling, but that seems to be a little more focused on allowing Google to continue serving relevant ads. On the surface, it appears to me to mean they want to have more control over them in order for them not to be completely killed.
21:12:24 <SchismXL[m]> <LRS "i will, lets get facebook, whats"> :p
21:16:54 <LRS> a last question, then i will shut up: can you recommend an appstore?
21:18:35 <LRS> thought about f-droid?
21:24:09 <SchismXL[m]> I don't mind it at all tbh.
21:24:18 <SchismXL[m]> Has the apps I want
21:26:03 <SchismXL[m]> LRim S  I'm sure cn3m could give you the lowdown of certain flaws in the F-Droid ecosystem but, for the most part, I like it.
21:27:18 <SchismXL[m]> Aurora Store for apps directly from Google Play Store without the actual store, too.
21:27:24 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid has issues, but yeah
21:27:28 <cn3m[m]> it is decent
21:28:00 <SchismXL[m]> Was expecting an essay. You've disappointed me!
21:28:47 <SchismXL[m]> :p
21:28:59 <ghostcat[m]> > Does disabling the camera software cancel out the QR reader?
21:28:59 <ghostcat[m]> cn3m:
21:30:06 <cn3m[m]> no
21:30:16 <LRS> nice and quick i think thats all i need to know. now its time for testing. thank you all for your pations and not banning me!
21:30:17 <cn3m[m]> apps can still access the camera without the camera app
21:31:25 <ghostcat[m]> cn3m: Ah. Interesting to know.
21:31:57 <cn3m[m]> <ghostcat[m] "cn3m: Ah. Interesting to know."> yep, the camera app is designed to be replaceable
21:32:38 <ghostcat[m]> cn3m: I see why people get camera covers or completely tear it down.
21:33:27 <cn3m[m]> if you get hacked that badly you have bigger issues
21:34:48 <ghostcat[m]> cn3m: Well it is more so for a phone that has already been compromised. I always find those projects interesting. Load up an custom ROM to take back control over the phone.
23:25:01 <marlow11[m]> My camera cover has always been a piece of electrical tape. I just habitually cover them on all devices regardless. Makes it hard to use a selfie stick but I've survived somehow
23:55:46 <aeonsolution[m]> Hi devs, I was able to port the patches from GrapheneOS to Android 11. I was building the development branch with the new kernel and got this error:
