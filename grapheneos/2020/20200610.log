00:00:16 <TheJollyRoger> (It's only if that text turns orange and says some ominous warning about "SOFTWARE INTEGRITY IS NOT GUARANTEED!" that you have to worry.)
00:00:32 <TheJollyRoger> fluoridatedsheep: excellent! If you run into any trouble hopefully we'll be able to sort you out.
00:01:57 <fluoridatedsheep> thanks, i appreciate it:)
00:02:02 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: I think you *might* be able to download Discord on GrapheneOS if you can ask them for a .apk. However, I should caution you that there is a nonzero chance that it may attempt to connect to Google Cloud Messaging, find no Play Services, it might not have a fallback written into it to allow it to handle the lack of Google Play, and suddenly exit without warning.
00:03:04 <TheJollyRoger> This typically happens if the app writers have not written their apps to continue working in the absence of Google Software Frameworks.
00:04:10 <strcat[m]> it should be really easy to make a toggle to use connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org now
00:04:14 <strcat[m]> I made the other required changes
00:04:16 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow.
00:04:19 <TheJollyRoger> Good morning strcat[m]
00:04:29 <strcat[m]> if anyone is interested in implementing that for Settings
00:04:29 <lucky[m]2> just tried discord and snapchat. they cant be validated for entry because facebook/google owns them
00:04:30 <strcat[m]> not going to do that part myself
00:04:55 <lucky[m]2> theres a pentesting app on the Fdroid store. cSscript or something. It says I need to be rooted to use it or something
00:05:00 <TheJollyRoger> Ack. Continuing to study up!
00:05:07 <lucky[m]2> whats preventing me from using it
00:05:24 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: I would never suggest rooting your GrapheneOS phone. The reason why is that root breaks the entire Android Security model.
00:05:36 <lucky[m]2> ooh ok
00:06:18 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: Android is not built like a regular desktop operating system, in that there are two levels of access: root, and everything else. Instead, Android is built actually of many little, separate, and often mutually-distrusting components.
00:06:50 <TheJollyRoger> Only a verrrrry very few components, such as init, which basically gets the kernel to work have root-equivalent access.
00:07:28 <lucky[m]2> okay cool
00:07:49 <lucky[m]2> what are some good aps for the os?
00:07:50 <TheJollyRoger> This is because the attitude taken by Android is very pragmatic: it's very easy for a system to be secure when it is only running preauthenticated, pre-vetted code from trusted sources like most Linux distributions are. However, Android assumes we are going to be getting many different apps from many different sources, and not all of them are trustworthy.
00:07:52 <lucky[m]2> im down for anything tbh
00:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: OpenCamera!
00:07:59 <lucky[m]2> i also still have to learn my ParrotOS
00:08:16 <TheJollyRoger> Because you have a Pixel 3, you should enable "Camera2" API in the settings, so that it takes advantage of Pixel Visual Core properly.
00:08:22 <TheJollyRoger> Your photos will come out great.
00:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: so with respect to "rooting" android... a lot of app developers, especially those trying to appeal to "power users" don't actually realize this part about Android's design, and don't know how to get their apps to co-operate with the system in a way that allows them to do only the task they need to do.
00:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> So what they instead do is ask people to /destroy the security model of their entire phone/ by rooting and essentially turning off features like verified boot and OTA updates.
00:09:44 <TheJollyRoger> Because they're lazy.
00:11:39 <strcat[m]> also OS developers
00:11:45 * TheJollyRoger stammers.
00:11:52 <TheJollyRoger> G-g-god, yes.
00:12:07 <TheJollyRoger> strcat I have a picture for you on that note:
00:13:18 <lucky[m]2> damn that is lazy... why would that app be offered in the first place? can other phones easily boot into root or whatever
00:14:13 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: well, partially because they want a feature or something that normally would violate the android security model. Usually this is done in the name of theatrics or "because it's cool."
00:14:24 <lucky[m]2> best mal client to use for OS?
00:14:45 <lucky[m]2> ooh lol i think its dumb that they put restrictions on those things
00:15:07 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: did you look at https://dev.exiv2.org/issues/1248
00:15:59 <TheJollyRoger> hey strcat[m] I... I was reading what you were saying on it earlier and thinking "Oh good gravy this sounds like a familiar story with GnuTLS" :(
00:16:03 <TheJollyRoger> Also uh...
00:16:55 <TheJollyRoger> Actually, oh man.
00:17:07 <lucky[m]2> is K9 mailgood?
00:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> hey lucky[m]2 I use k9mail, some people use FairEmail, give both of them a try and see which one you like.
00:18:06 <renlord> https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1011
00:18:08 <renlord> hehe
00:18:17 <renlord> rip gnutls
00:18:21 * TheJollyRoger starts drowning his sorrows.
00:18:33 <renlord> not that we use it
00:19:23 <TheJollyRoger> This is crazy. Imagine sending someone a malicious image that causes a buffer overflow and writes executable code into an area of memory where code is being executed.
00:19:42 <TheJollyRoger> All from one image!
00:19:43 <renlord> that happens almost quite regularly
00:19:44 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "also OS developers"> They're even worse. I've seen lazy OS developers disable like all of the security model.
00:19:51 <TheJollyRoger> like what is this, 2004?
00:20:10 <madaidan[m]> People actually use shit that disables verified boot, SELinux, etc.
00:20:13 <renlord> rich media is hard.
00:20:30 * TheJollyRoger downs the whole bottle.
00:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> Shumtimesh thish ish jusht too depresshing.
00:20:46 <TheJollyRoger> *hic*
00:21:13 <renlord> madaidan[m]: some people also believe the earth is flat
00:21:20 <renlord> i believe there's a correlation there.
00:23:45 <TheJollyRoger> One of theshe daysh *hic* I'm going to make a Venn Diagram with one circle reading "What the ushersh *hic* want to happen." and another circle reading "What'sh shecure" and there being only a shliver of overlap, but I'm not quite shure what to *hic*  capshun that little shpace yet.
00:34:00 * TheJollyRoger starts sobering up.
00:34:35 <madaidan[m]> That was quick
00:35:11 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: the reason we put restrictions on things is to mitigate exploits. For instance, opening the door to allow your phone to modify your trusted system partition means you would be able to root partition... but it *also* means opening the same door for malware to do so as well, and trust me on this but you really don't want that.
00:35:20 <TheJollyRoger> madaidan[m]: ehehe, I realized I hadn't answered something :P.
00:35:22 <TheJollyRoger> *hic*
02:17:40 <raheemwala[m]> What’s a good alternative to google voice since it won’t work on graphene?
02:18:52 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe something like linphone ? A VoIP client, with a VoIP provider
02:19:53 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe it depends on what functionality you are looking for
02:25:11 <raheemwala[m]> Just want to use another number
02:25:24 <raheemwala[m]> to register for stuff
02:25:44 <raheemwala[m]> I will check out Lin phone
03:07:23 <joshman[m]> Viber In works great. You can Get a number from various countries to use as an incoming call/text solution
03:38:01 <furofuro_01[m]> How hard is it to install ArchLinux?
03:39:07 <analog[m]> furofuro_01 It's not hard at all.
03:39:43 <analog[m]> furofuro_01 Especially if you read their documentation.
03:48:50 <joshman[m]> Another question is why install?
03:49:26 <renlord> archlinux is the easiest
03:49:36 <renlord> out of all the linux distros
03:49:55 <analog[m]> Nah, Void is easiest.
03:50:00 <renlord> mount; pacstrap; arch-chroot; done
03:50:16 <renlord> less than 5 min
03:50:39 <analog[m]> I speedrun Void installs for fun
03:53:17 <furofuro_01[m]> <analog[m] "furofuro_01 It's not hard at all"> thanks I guess. Needed it for signify
04:01:44 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]: not hard at all. Everything's mostly done automatically, you just have to know a few commandline tricks and follow the instructions. The first time I did it I just forgot to install dhcpcd. So long as you have that the rest is relatively simple.
04:04:40 <TheJollyRoger> The important part that I learned very quickly was /not to try to get clever/ and most importantly to /not think I know better and not take shortcuts/.
04:04:55 <strcat[m]> the signify step doesn't make sense if you're going to install other software without signature verification to do it
04:04:59 <strcat[m]> it is clearly explained in the guide
04:11:27 <renlord> why do people say that linux is a better kernel when comparing between NT and linux?
04:11:38 <TheJollyRoger> Ideology...?
04:11:43 <renlord> when NT is clearly superior in its relatively more modular and cleaner archtiecture
04:11:52 <renlord> I is confused.
04:12:55 <TheJollyRoger> I get the impression of Linux was easier to use and had lower barriers to entry for nontechnical people than Windows did, Windows would become the L337 h4x0rs OS in very short order, heh heh heh.
04:16:18 <renlord> users dont typically have to interface with either NT/Linu
04:16:42 <renlord> non-technical users mostly touch the DE and maybe some GNU tools
04:17:11 <renlord> so the confusion mostly is to do with how technical people actually appreciate linux more compared to NT
04:17:58 <user1_> How do I enable the New Folder button on the Files app? Mine was disabled by default.
04:18:06 <user1_> ?
04:21:32 <TheJollyRoger> user1, try navigating to a location (you may need to turn on "show internal storage" first). Recent Items won't allow you to create a new directory.
04:38:51 <furofuro_01[m]> <strcat[m] "the signify step doesn't make se"> What do you mean?
04:38:59 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]:
04:39:06 <TheJollyRoger> Whoops.
04:39:14 <furofuro_01[m]> <TheJollyRoger "furofuro_01:"> Hmmm?
04:39:37 <TheJollyRoger> furofuro_01[m]: when you install something from your operating system's trusted repositories, they're already sending it to you in a way that's been preauthenticated and tied all the way back to your operating system's root of trust.
04:40:45 <furofuro_01[m]> Then... What should I do?
04:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> However, if you were to download and install and compile signify from source, then you're trusting the source code delivered to you via nothing more than TLS and then compiling it. There's no preauthenticated root of trust there except for the certificate authorities, and that only authenticates the transport layer.
04:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> Not the source code nor the binaries.
04:40:57 <furofuro_01[m]> Signify that is maintained is only available on Arch
04:41:13 <strcat[m]> furofuro_01: the guide explains this
04:41:19 <TheJollyRoger> Then what you should do is use the Remote Attestation on attestation.app to verify using Auditor.
04:41:26 <strcat[m]> > To verify the download of the OS beyond the security offered by HTTPS, you can use the signify tool. If you do not have a way to obtain signify from a package repository you're already trusting, it does not make sense to use it. GrapheneOS releases are hosted on our servers and we do not have third party mirrors. A compromised signify would be able to compromise your OS and the GrapheneOS download due to the lack of
04:41:26 <strcat[m]> an application security model on traditional operating systems. It would be worse than not trying to verify the signatures. It's far less likely that our servers would be compromised than someone's GitHub account or GitHub itself. You're already trusting these installation instructions from our site, which is hosted on the same static web server infrastructure as the releases.
04:41:38 <strcat[m]> read the guide don't just copy-paste the commands
04:42:04 <strcat[m]> and later it says
04:42:05 <strcat[m]> > Verify the factory images using the signature if you were able to obtain signify from trusted package repositories (see above):
04:42:36 <strcat[m]> and if you're using a distribution where packages are frozen and not updated in general
04:42:44 <strcat[m]> I don't really see why you're concerned about signify in particular
04:43:07 <furofuro_01[m]> Well
04:43:28 <furofuro_01[m]> I was trying to make sure that what I install GrapheneOS in the future
04:43:29 <furofuro_01[m]> Is not compromised
04:44:08 <TheJollyRoger> Well, don't forget: even if you do download a malicious version of GrapheneOS, Auditor uses the Strongbox keymaster and remote attestation, and will be able to catch it red-handed, even while the operating system is running.
04:44:54 <furofuro_01[m]> Guess the more vital part here is Auditor and Auditee?
04:45:15 <furofuro_01[m]> Sorry, quite new on installation of GrapheneOS
04:45:21 <furofuro_01[m]> I wanted to install it the moment I get Pixel 3a
04:45:34 <TheJollyRoger> You just need to trust the device that's displaying the audit data not to lie to you.
04:45:49 <TheJollyRoger> No problem, what questions could I answer for you?
04:46:31 <TheJollyRoger> So for instance, if you have another handset that you trust, or you have a PC you trust, (and you trust Let's Encrypt and GrapheneOS' servers), you can use attestation.app.
04:46:53 <TheJollyRoger> *if you have another handset you trust, you can use that. Or if you have a PC you trust
04:47:01 <TheJollyRoger> You need one or the other, you don't need both.
04:47:17 <TheJollyRoger> Although having more is, admittedly, kind of nice :D
04:50:50 <furofuro_01[m]> Well, is it fine to use adaptor of USB 3.1 to USB C instead of the cable iself?
04:50:55 <furofuro_01[m]> When flashing GrapheneOS?
04:52:25 <TheJollyRoger> Please just use a high quality USB-A to USB-C cable.
04:52:36 <TheJollyRoger> That's what works, please stick to it.
04:53:13 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure if those adapters contain ASICs or the like.
04:53:18 <TheJollyRoger> Or if they just move the wires around.
04:53:23 <TheJollyRoger> Either way, just stick with what works.
04:56:18 <furofuro_01[m]> Welp.
04:58:57 <furofuro_01[m]> I dont have them. It's not available.
04:59:22 <furofuro_01[m]> I'll just give you some news if it works or not
04:59:31 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. Hey, who knows, you might get lucky.
04:59:47 <TheJollyRoger> If you get the chance though, you should *definitely* order a proper USB A to C cable.
04:59:56 <TheJollyRoger> This is one thing you as a Pixel 3 owner should never ever ever skimp out on.
04:59:58 <furofuro_01[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I'm not sure if those adapters c"> Wdym ASICs though
05:00:11 <TheJollyRoger> Chips.
05:00:18 <TheJollyRoger> extra circuitry.
05:00:50 <TheJollyRoger> I don't know if adapters these days contain application-specific integrated circuits which may have bugs, may not support everything that fastboot needs, etc.
05:01:13 <TheJollyRoger> Someone else will have to chime in on this because I don't know.
05:07:44 <joshman[m]> OEM cable works like a charm
05:08:16 <TheJollyRoger> joshman[m]: provided your kernel fully supports USB C, and your hardware plays along well with it too.
05:09:07 <TheJollyRoger> For older kernels, especially ones shipped by Ubuntu and Debian at times this can be very dicey.
05:16:25 <furofuro_01[m]> Guess Arch it is then?
05:17:56 <TheJollyRoger> Pick one of the supported distros, and I can help you through it if you like.
05:18:14 <renlord> furofuro_01[m]: just pick any
05:19:18 <furofuro_01[m]> Which one has the newest kernel?
05:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> Usually that's Arch.
05:21:10 <TheJollyRoger> Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is supported, so give that a try possibly.
05:21:16 <furofuro_01[m]> Ok, I'll install Arch as preparation
05:21:30 <TheJollyRoger> especially if you've never run any sort of Linux before.
05:21:43 <TheJollyRoger> In all honesty though, if you already have Windows 10, just use Windows 10.
05:21:57 <furofuro_01[m]> I've tried Linux before, using Fedora
05:22:15 <furofuro_01[m]> Fedora w/ Windows 10
05:22:19 <TheJollyRoger> In all honesty you should be fine then, provided you obtain the proper Fastboot from Google.
05:22:31 <TheJollyRoger> And use the proper udev rules.
05:22:45 <renlord> just use fedora lol
05:22:53 <renlord> or WSL
05:23:03 <furofuro_01[m]> <renlord "just use fedora lol"> Hmmm?
05:23:14 <renlord> if you're fluent with fedora, just use fedora
05:23:16 <TheJollyRoger> Exactly what it says on the tin, just use what you have. You'll be fine.
05:23:35 <cn3m[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "Guess Arch it is then?"> Use Windows 10 it's better
05:23:36 <renlord> dont go out of your way to learn another distro just for one thing
05:23:51 <renlord> there are win10 installation instructions
05:23:55 <renlord> just use powershell
05:24:49 <furofuro_01[m]> Ok.
05:25:35 <furofuro_01[m]> Just in case, I'll get a Ugreen usb A to C wire soon, if it restocks or something
05:26:50 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "Use Windows 10 it's better "> It's easier there I guess?
05:26:59 <TheJollyRoger> Good thinking. It'll come in handy, just in case the adapter doesn't work.
05:27:53 <TheJollyRoger> Never skimp out on USB-C cables: because of Qualcomm's fast-charging Pixels can sometimes draw more current than normal.
05:27:59 <TheJollyRoger> If the charger supports it.
05:29:19 <renlord> has anyone's usb-c cables caught fire?
05:29:28 <furofuro_01[m]> Alright. Hope it arrives soon.
05:29:53 <TheJollyRoger> I think one of the Google Engineers, Benson Leung actually had that happen to him.
05:30:16 <renlord> lol
05:30:20 <renlord> must be a thin wire
05:30:31 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah, it fried the laptop.
05:30:50 <renlord> how's that possible
05:30:57 <renlord> the laptop controller must be buggy also then
05:31:06 <renlord> or the power supply had a surge or something
05:31:37 <renlord> apparently the charger comes with a microcontroller these days
05:31:49 <renlord> i suppose that didnt work also
05:32:03 <TheJollyRoger> Not sure, it sounds like it might've just shorted.
05:32:13 <TheJollyRoger> *just overheated and shorted.
05:54:41 <zaxxa[m]> > Never skimp out on USB-C cables: because of Qualcomm's fast-charging Pixels can sometimes draw more current than normal.
05:54:41 <zaxxa[m]> I use the cable that came supplied
06:03:41 <TheJollyRoger> zaxxa[m]: yes, good!
06:23:47 <nickcalyx[m]> I heard the 4a may support wireless charging
06:23:55 <nickcalyx[m]> That's the.rumor
06:32:16 <cn3m[m]> I want a 4a, but if GrapheneOS isn't going to support it that's a deal breaker
06:32:27 <cn3m[m]> Rather get an iPhone 12 or something
06:34:34 <TheJollyRoger> Humm.
06:40:38 <joshman[m]> <TheJollyRoger "For older kernels, especially on"> Oh. Thanks for the heads-up. I was not aware of this. It workes flawlessly on Manjaro
06:41:22 <TheJollyRoger> joshman[m]: got it, that makes sense, I think Arch is Manjaro's upstream provider.
06:44:33 <user1_> How do I enable the New Folder button on the Files app? Mine was disabled by default.
06:44:50 <user1_> Hitting Show internal storage didn't help
06:45:29 <user1_> I'm also trying to create a folder in Images not in Recent
06:46:22 <joshman[m]> 4a will be another disappointment. 400nits display in 2020 against Apple's 1100..... For pretty much the same price and no Graphene support? I'll take iPhone every day
06:46:34 <user1_> Ahh, I see. I can't make folders in those special folders that seem to just congregate types of files. It's not really a folder in the storage directory. Is that right?
06:48:44 <joshman[m]> TheJollyRoger correct it is pretty much Arch, though I find it better. Updates are a week or two late which gives devs time to fix crap
06:50:46 <cn3m[m]> <joshman[m] "4a will be another disappointmen"> 1100 nits? I thought it was 600 or something
06:52:51 <TheJollyRoger> user1_: yes, that's correct. Try navigating to another location and trying again?
06:52:59 <TheJollyRoger> joshman[m]: oh huh.
06:53:14 <joshman[m]> cn3m I guess you're right about SE. High nits are on Pro version
06:53:43 <nikoleos[m]> Hi, any alternative for assistant or text to speach for grapheneOS , with privacy and security and open source code ?
06:54:27 <cn3m[m]> <nikoleos[m] "Hi, any alternative for assistan"> Siri /s
06:54:33 <zaxxa[m]> 625 not display on apple se according to apple website and more expensive than pixel 3a launch price
06:54:42 <user1_> TheJollyRoger: It worked. It's a shame that the gallery app isn't able to create folders.
06:54:46 <zaxxa[m]> nit*
06:54:47 <joshman[m]> * cn3m I guess you're right about SE. High nits are on Pro version
06:54:47 <joshman[m]> Anyways, 400 vs 634ish is substantially brighter display
06:54:54 <cn3m[m]> <joshman[m] "cn3m I guess you're right about "> Thanks, maybe an iPhone 11 Pro after the 12 improves the market could be a good phone
06:55:43 <cn3m[m]> I'll probably get a Pixel 5, but if it sucks and I can't get a 4a. I might consider an iPhone
06:58:55 <nikoleos[m]> > > <@nikoleos:matrix.org> Hi, any alternative for assistant or text to speach for grapheneOS , with privacy and security and open source code ?
06:58:55 <nikoleos[m]> > Siri /s
06:58:55 <nikoleos[m]> I ask for graphene OS and i seek for something running on the device, not a distant server
07:00:14 <cn3m[m]> nikoleos: an assistant would be hard to find. I think Mycroft might work, but it's not ready yet. Try building it from source?
07:00:33 <joshman[m]> zaxxa SE and 3a is day and night built wise and technically. You can't compare cheap peace of plastic with cpu from 2016 against a powerhouse. "not an apple fanboy"
07:02:15 <cn3m[m]> Yeah SE demolishes a Pixel 3a. I've used both side by side. I wouldn't ever switch, but I have to admit
07:03:50 <cn3m[m]> iPhone SE is a damn good phone and I haven't recommended any other phone to anyone irl since it came out
07:04:40 <joshman[m]> 3a is such a cheap phone for high price. No P3 color gamut, low brightness, plastic, no wireless charging. If no GrapheneOS I'd never consider it as a phone ever
07:06:00 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3a was a great phone a year ago. It's still a great phone
07:06:02 <joshman[m]> cn3m I'd say it demolishes 4 any day (3a is out of its league)
07:06:03 <cn3m[m]> The iPhone SE is the best phone deal since I dunno the iPhone
07:06:27 <cn3m[m]> The Nexus 5x was almost there king though
07:07:32 <nikoleos[m]> > nikoleos: an assistant would be hard to find. I think Mycroft might work, but it's not ready yet. Try building it from source?
07:07:32 <nikoleos[m]> Thanks , mycroft looks good but i'm not a dev, i only build LOSformicroG with docker in the past for a previous device not officilaly supported, i m not sure to succes to build the apk at all
07:08:15 <zaxxa[m]> I don't see the point in comparing phones which have something like over a $100 price difference right now
07:09:20 <cn3m[m]> <zaxxa[m] "I don't see the point in compari"> iPhone is $80 per year of support and the Pixel 3a is $150 per year of support
07:10:18 <joshman[m]> <cn3m[m] "iPhone is $80 per year of suppor"> T H I S !
07:10:27 <zaxxa[m]> Again, I don't see what your point is, you either have the money to get one or you don't
07:11:22 <joshman[m]> zaxxa you are ripped off buying what initially seems cheaper device
07:11:37 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3a and iPhone SE are both best in class
07:11:37 <zaxxa[m]> Ok Josh
07:12:17 <cn3m[m]> I prefer the 3a, but the SE is so good I can't recommend anything else to the average person
07:12:19 <cn3m[m]> <joshman[m] "zaxxa you are ripped off buying "> Not everyone keeps their phones that long though
07:12:46 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3a is cheaper for a 2 year phone
07:13:11 <joshman[m]> <cn3m[m] "Not everyone keeps their phones "> Ok. Have a look at resale value in 3 years of both devices
07:13:42 <cn3m[m]> That's true, but not everyone sells old phones
07:13:47 <zaxxa[m]> Please note I didn't even say one was better than the other, I merely said one was more expensive. I didn't mean for the discussion to go into a discussion about comparing these phones. Im honestly not that interested in such discussion
07:14:22 <cn3m[m]> Both are excellent phones and for different people
07:47:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <joshman[m] "4a will be another disappointmen"> Tbh my Mi9t pro display goes upto 600 and i rarely use it at max brightness, it actually hurts my eyes to watch sometimes at peak brightness for more than 10 min , i don't get what 1100 would be good for , i care more about display being able to hit lower brightness better than achieving 1000 for HDR content or something
07:58:22 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "iPhone is $80 per year of suppor"> This is true if you keep the phone in good shape for it's whole lifetime, if you accidentally drop it and need a screen replacement, then this doesn't apply, plus I'd prefer a plastic back to a glass one for the same reason , I'm gonna use a case anyway so why bother with more expensive and fragile glass
07:58:37 <TheJollyRoger> mxnorvak[m]: maybe watching videos at the beach under blazing sun...?
07:58:50 <TheJollyRoger> Or I dunno, while you're suntanning...?
07:58:55 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm joking XP)
08:00:18 <cn3m[m]> I've never broken a phone once and iPhone 7/8/SE are cheap to repair stuff
08:00:45 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "mxnorvak: maybe watching videos "> Hehe yeah there are use cases , maybe it just isn't useful for me
08:01:44 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe X3.
08:01:52 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "(I'm joking XP)"> BTW what usb C to A cable do you recommend ? I've always used Anker and they've been great
08:03:45 <TheJollyRoger> Hey mxnorvak[m] I'm not an expert on this so take this with a grain of salt, but I actually found I kind of like iCAN Premium cables, since I've usually had good luck with them being built like rocks. The braided nylon on them is nice and thick, and it doesn't start "fraying"
08:03:49 <TheJollyRoger> Which I've had happen before.
08:04:13 <TheJollyRoger> The connectors are also pretty beefy, and they're not all that expensive either.
08:04:46 <radixed9[m]> 8gb of ram is not enough for Edge WDAG, Core Isolation, a few programs, and Hyper-V :(
08:05:22 <TheJollyRoger> I think some people may not like them because they take something of a "brute force" approach to durability, as in "just throw more rubber and layers and plastic overtop." but for somenoe like me I find they work well.
08:05:55 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I think some people may not like"> Thanks ,I'll check em out
08:06:47 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I usually get them at CanadaComputers, I think they're just the store brand.
08:08:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hope you find what you're looking for!
08:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> I just buy the really big, super, chunky ones.
08:09:21 <mxnorvak[m]> <cn3m[m] "I've never broken a phone once a"> Actually i just checked and Iphone SE screen replacement is just 20$ more expensive than 3a, so yeah you're right
08:10:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hope you find what you're lookin"> I'm happy with Anker Cables but I'm always looking for better options
08:10:27 <TheJollyRoger> I've found I actually like the nylon braided cables more, because they tend to "wind up" and then turn into impromptu springs less and are easier for me to unwind, but this is largely a personal preference.
08:10:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
08:11:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "I've found I actually like the n"> I Agree
08:12:49 <cn3m[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Actually i just checked and Ipho"> Yeah it's pretty affordable and they do it in the store
08:37:47 <TheJollyRoger> Time to pass out.
08:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> Night!
08:41:05 <joshman[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Tbh my Mi9t pro display goes upt"> True HDR starts at 800
08:41:58 <joshman[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "This is true if you keep the pho"> Expensive glass in a case for wireless charging
08:42:50 <joshman[m]> Also 3a display sticks out of the frame which makes my eyes bleed of this design failure
08:45:22 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3a has a large screen, rich speakers, the best camera in the world (Pixel 4 excluded), and the best OS in the world out of the box
08:46:53 <cn3m[m]> Headphone jack too
08:47:13 <cn3m[m]> Out of the box fast charger
08:47:16 <cn3m[m]> It's also a year old
08:51:15 <cn3m[m]> iPhone SE and Pixel 3a are both wonderful
08:53:09 <joshman[m]> 4th best camera. If you use Gcam
09:04:38 <jalb66> A new article I was sent about GOS: https://dt.gl/grapheneos-privacy-security-matters/
09:04:54 <jalb66> A new article I received in xmpp channel about GOS: https://dt.gl/grapheneos-privacy-security-matters/
09:05:39 <jalb66> Maybe some member here wrote it..?
09:12:40 <Arhu> Pixel 3 is better than the Pixel 3a except not having a headphone jack, and were you can still get them they're about the same price
09:13:01 <Arhu> Camera hardware is the same but Pixel 3 has significantly faster processing
09:23:00 <mxnorvak[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Night!"> Sleep well Cap
09:35:14 <mxnorvak[m]> <joshman[m] "Expensive glass in a case for wi"> Yea true wireless charging is a nice feature to have
09:38:54 <Arhu> wireless charging is a useless meme which is either worse in usability or bad for your battery
09:40:47 <Arhu> if my phone is on a cable I can pick it up and use it while it keeps charging, if it's on a wireless charging station, it's unhandy to use, or I have to interrupt the charging
09:43:03 <Arhu> glass back is more fragile, they should just use one of those nice rubbery-feeling plastics
09:43:50 <wonderfall[m]> It's been a year since I have my 3a and it was a such a great investment. Back then I didn't about Graphene or the security stuff, though. Now if there was no Graphene I would've considered switching to an iPhone. Only drawback is the camera on Graphene, but I've seen people using GCam and "GcamServiceProvider" (on Github) to avoid any craches. Might be worth a try.
09:44:07 <Arhu> iPhone 7 -> iPhone 8 form factor was a regression just for the wireless charging
09:48:17 <mxnorvak[m]> <Arhu "wireless charging is a useless m"> I actually haven't ever used wireless charging but i can see how it'd be a nice feature in case you're working from a desk, that being said yeah cable works as well i don't have anything against it
10:02:57 <Arhu> if while it's charging you pick your phone up to use it and afterwards place it back on the wireless charging station, your battery life will go to shit more quickly
10:07:39 <mxnorvak[m]> Why?
10:12:00 <joshman[m]> Weird bug/feature found. Upon booting up I can't get pass SIM PIN entry. Even on Airplane mode
10:12:27 <joshman[m]> Can someone replicate?
10:28:36 <renor> Yup, can't be passed
10:29:37 <joshman[m]> Is that aosp thingie? Why is it there? Weird setting
10:32:28 <renlord> file an issue pls
10:32:33 <renlord> and best also collect some logs

11:45:53 <joshman[m]> Another thing. Need groups confirmation
11:47:03 <joshman[m]> While on the phone I constantly pull down notification bar with my ear which leads to all kids of stupid stuff like turning airplane mode and on off which leads to canceled active call. Need something to block the screen while on call

14:36:09 <jalb66> dallemon[m], isn't it dangerous to disable the SIM pin?..
14:37:00 <renor> Not disabling, just being able to not activate the SIM
14:37:40 <renor> Just like if the SIM is not on the phone, if you decide to skip SIM pin
14:38:09 <jalb66> renor: I mean about the answer dallemon gave to furofuro_01[m]
14:38:15 <altoslos[m]1> josh.man: do you have a screen protector on?
14:38:35 <renor> jalb66: oh, sorry

14:40:46 <altoslos[m]1> has anyone gotten discord notifications working on graphene?
14:50:47 <marlow11[m]> altoslos: I think it relies on google services for push notifications
14:51:18 <marlow11[m]> Signal runs constantly in the background to get around it
14:52:48 <marlow11[m]> I don't get push notifications from the protonmail app either
15:00:20 <altoslos[m]1> yeah it works with microg but microg doesn't work on graphene
15:00:52 <dazinism> <altoslos[m]1 "josh.man: do you have a screen p"> I was wondering if the proximity sensor is a bit dodgy, but could also be protector messing with it
15:05:08 <joshman[m]> <altoslos[m]1 "josh.man: do you have a screen p"> No protection
15:06:38 <joshman[m]> <dazinism "I was wondering if the proximity"> Must be something with proximity sensor. I'd disable it if I could
15:07:02 <altoslos[m]1> josh.man: getting a tempered glass screen protector might help (and physically help your screen as well!)
15:21:16 <skratchnsniff[m]> Hey, how is bank transfer more anonymous' or private than the usual major payment methods? Sorry to ask here but you peoples seem to be pretty solid.
15:21:17 <skratchnsniff[m]> Like if I wanna buy a laptop or phone online.
15:21:18 <skratchnsniff[m]> Am I better to be patient and bank transfer?
15:22:46 <dazinism> josh.man: can see what the proximity sensor sees with  https://f-droid.org/app/com.vonglasow.michael.satstat
15:32:49 <nickcalyx[m]> Bank transfers create records just like credit cards
15:34:31 <skratchnsniff[m]> That is why I was confused. Thanks.
15:34:59 <skratchnsniff[m]> Does nickalyx mean you are calyxos person?
15:47:12 <nickcalyx[m]> > Does nickalyx mean you are calyxos person?
15:47:12 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes
15:48:16 <skratchnsniff[m]> I mean to test that OS out later. I look forward to checking it out.
16:00:45 <nickcalyx[m]> <skratchnsniff[m] "I mean to test that OS out later"> Cool well feel free to ask questions in #calyxos
16:02:05 <skratchnsniff[m]> Cheers, yea I saw that room. Thanks again.
16:08:01 <altoslos[m]1> I run Calyx OS right now, it's nice :)
16:11:25 <furofuro_01[m]> (Also, Im quite surpised it (CalyxOS) hasnt been recommended by PTIO for some reason)
16:12:25 <furofuro_01[m]> Just curious about it, but on some aspects, I see some reasons.
16:12:54 <altoslos[m]1> maybe because it's new(ish)?
16:15:15 <furofuro_01[m]> <altoslos[m]1 "maybe because it's new(ish)?"> Not sure about that tbh...
16:15:31 <furofuro_01[m]> * Not sure about that tbh...
16:15:31 <furofuro_01[m]> I saw it some time ago when Pixel 1 was still supported by Calyx

16:16:51 <altoslos[m]1> furofuro_01: I could be wrong, but I think it's a little over a year old?
16:17:08 <altoslos[m]1> judging but the gitlab commit history
16:18:39 <furofuro_01[m]> Welp. Maybe we can ask them for more accurate answers.
16:19:52 <furofuro_01[m]> But yeah. That is possible that they are over a year old.
18:09:29 <madaidan[m]> strcat: Is https://github.com/madaidan/kernel_google_crosshatch/commits/fortify_source everything? I think the only commit missing is the kvmalloc one but that's because kvmalloc_node doesn't exist in the first place.
