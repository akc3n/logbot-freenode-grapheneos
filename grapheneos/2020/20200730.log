Just go to the search engine you want to add, search something, and then check the search engines menu under Vanadium's settings. An option to add it should be there, but I don't think you can add more than one at a time to the list. Also, make sure you're not in incognito mode.

00:11:55 <JTL> Apples and oranges. (Last time I checked anyway) ungoogled chromium didn't exist for mobile
00:13:19 <nightjar[m]> Yes. Vanadium is the best option for GrapheneOS because it has security hardening specific to running it on Graphene. UGC is good for traditional desktop systems if you can find an up-to-date build of it but on Graphene you get the best of UGC plus more hardening with Vanadium.

08:25:16 <ruddo[m]> Well, having to type a long passphrase at boot.  And every two-three days.  That's about it.
08:27:01 <wyris[m]> I am pretty much unfamiliar with how Android's encryption works. Only the long passphrase will be used for encryption but not the fingerprint?
08:28:39 <wyris[m]>  * I am pretty much unfamiliar with how Android's encryption works. Only the long passphrase will be used for encryption but not the fingerprint?
08:28:39 <wyris[m]> I am asking because my current device uses the same PIN/password for both encryption and screen unlocking.
08:29:15 <SchismXL[m]> Biometric is secondary. Think of it as making life easier for you.
08:29:31 <fnodeb> btw, regarding multiple user profiles
08:30:16 <fnodeb> I have quite a handful of profiles for varying purposes. I don't wish to reuse passwords, and have awful memory. What would you guys suggest?
08:30:41 <SchismXL[m]> After first boot, you cannot use biometrics. You have to input your password first. After that, you are able to use biometrics.
08:30:54 <wyris[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Biometric is secondary. Think of"> So I should think about it as: the strong password on boot is used for decrypting the storage and also the biometrics that I can use later for unlocking the screen ?
08:31:11 <fnodeb> I would prefer sticking to pass(word/phrase)
08:31:42 <SchismXL[m]> <fnodeb "I have quite a handful of profil"> Change a couple of details in the password? So instead of GrapheneOS, maybe Gr4phene0S etc etc.
08:32:58 <SchismXL[m]> <wyris[m] "So I should think about it as: t"> Yeah. Like LUKS, you use a strong password to access the encrypted drive, then another password to access the desktop. But, in this case, the secondary password is biometrics.
08:33:09 <fnodeb> That could work, but the memoric effort could still be really high with the number of profiles I have. Are there any compartmentalization schemes you guys have in mind?
08:34:43 <wyris[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Yeah. Like LUKS, you use a stron"> Thank you, all clear now. My confusion came from the fact that my old device used the same method for screen locking and encryption where as on Linux the LUKS password has nothing to do with user password.
08:35:14 <SchismXL[m]> <fnodeb "That could work, but the memoric"> If it is first boot, you'll struggle to find anything without remembering. Maybe use KeePass on another device to remind you?
08:37:25 <SchismXL[m]> <wyris[m] "Thank you, all clear now. My con"> The only difference is, is that you can still use that same "LUKS" password to unlock the phone, but you've essentially got the gist of it. It is safe and secure so don't worry! If someone cuts your finger off or clones your fingerprint, then you got bigger worries (after first boot). That's why I always recommend to use the "Lockdown" option, which clears biometrics and
08:37:25 <SchismXL[m]> ensures you got to input your password.

10:06:02 <pikey[m]> what sort of battery life do people get out of Pixel 3? I still have a feeling I have a lemon of a device here somehow. Connectivity issues persist but battery is another major issue. I came from iphone 5SE so I know this is a bigger screen and differences are to be expected. But my friend used a pixel 3a and had much better life than me. Mine is 128GB Pixel 3 (in case that makes a difference). I start the day on 100%,
10:06:02 <pikey[m]> if I watch a youtube video while doing some chores or whatever, i find it's around 20% very quickly maybe 2 hours ish. is that normal?
10:06:19 <pikey[m]> if anyone thinks this is better placed in off topic room please say and i will budge over
10:13:50 <cdesai> 3a will definitely last longer than the 3, but dropping 80% in just 2 hours doesn't sound normal at all
10:14:37 <cdesai> what does your battery usage chart look like, and what's the top contributor?
10:18:57 <international> hello
10:19:41 <international> may i ask about the recommended apps to open spreed , sheets and word files on the phone

10:28:36 <international> thank you very much
10:35:19 <international> i like using graphene os a lot on my pixel 3 but the screen size it self is what i don't like about the phone
10:35:30 <international> so i will upgrade to pixel xl
10:36:04 <international> is i worth the price to get pixel 4 or 3 will be enough as i don't think i will need the camera upgrade
10:36:47 <alzxjm[m]> international: Can you get a Pixel 3a XL?
10:37:45 <international> is i do i think but i think the screen isn't as good as it will be on normal pixel but not sure no actual experince
10:38:06 <international> i think i can do *
10:39:24 <alzxjm[m]> Based on my experience, the Pixel 3a looks and feels just as good as a non-a Pixel. I use a Pixel 4 XL and I wouldn't notice any drop-off with the 3a screen if I didn't use the phones side-by-side. I think the 3a is the better deal, especially if you don't need the superior camera.
10:39:47 <cn3m[m]> The 4XL will be very fast though
10:40:01 <cn3m[m]> longer support
10:41:04 <international> thank you very much for this comparison
10:41:47 <international> speed will always be nice to have which is the main reason for me to leave Ubuntu touch
10:42:53 <alzxjm[m]> The Pixel 4 XL is awesome. I won't try to talk anyone out of using it.
10:43:49 <alzxjm[m]> Project Soli (radar sensor) does not work on GrapheneOS and you may experience screen flickering issues at low brightness due to the 90 Hz screen implementation, but the phone is super fast, has great battery life, an amazing camera, and runs smooth as can be on GrapheneOS or CalyxOS.
10:44:47 <international> will but that i mind thank you so much

10:56:46 <alzxjm[m]> Yes, or the Aurora store.
10:57:28 <crixtnn[m]> i had a 3xl, great phone but battery life was meh. got the 3a xl, feels a bit plasticy and the display is a tad greenish but the battery life is great. i get 9+ hours of screen on time frequently. thing is i switch between users and apps often and the phone is not that snappy. 4 gb of ram is also kind of low and apps get closed. im probably gonna get a 4 xl even tho i really like the fingerprint scanner.
11:10:41 <international> so if i use EteSync synch with all my devices insted of google

15:21:39 <crixtnn[m]> also colabora office is great.
15:22:30 <SchismXL[m]> <crixtnn[m] "I've installed it in the work pr"> In the dark or low light situations, or when zooming in, you may see a difference. But for good light conditions, Open Camera is comparable tbh.
15:23:10 <alzxjm[m]> <crixtnn[m] "I've installed it in the work pr"> It has Night Mode, and the shutter is much faster than Open Camera. Open Camera GUI is not great.
15:24:00 <alzxjm[m]> I don't think the regular pictures would be better on a non-a phone, as OC would use the Pixel Neural Core with Camera2 API.
15:24:08 <alzxjm[m]> But the other features are nice.
15:25:03 <alzxjm[m]> On a 3a I wonder if Gcam would be superior, though. It could use Google's AI for image processing.

15:37:19 <Knull[m]> <brenneke[m] "What are you looking for that Va"> it's more to me that bromite seems to be the exact same thing as vanadium except where vanadium is hardened for gos. So it terms of disposability, I grabbed ddg. But nobody here really talks about ddg as a browser. If it's unapproved, why is vanadium's default search ddg? Better yet, why would vanadium come with alternative search engines for Google, Yahoo, and Bing?
15:37:19 <Knull[m]> getting a little off topic, but I guess I don't understand having bromite alongside vanadium
15:37:28 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <Knull[m] "opinions on ddg browser? ddg vs "> The DuckDuckGo app doesn't seem to have any trackers (source: Exodus Privacy), but as alzxjm mentioned, Vanadium is the default and preferred GrapheneOS browser and Bromite is the only acceptable alternative

15:47:55 <ForeverNoob[m]> do I need to unlock bootloader from Android settings ?
15:48:56 <SchismXL[m]> In developer options (tapping build number a few times until you've got developer options enabled), you've got to select OEM unlocking
15:49:25 <SchismXL[m]> While you're there, also enable USB debugging, just in case.
15:50:45 <ForeverNoob[m]> oh that's right, I completely forgot about that one, thanks!

15:51:25 <ForeverNoob[m]> yep :p
15:54:11 <overheadscallop[> Knull: Use Vanadium to blend in with other Pixel users and to benefit from hardening. Use Bromite if you want built-in ad blocking and some privacy enhancements. No other browsers are recommended. The default search in Vanadium has no bearing on how trustworthy DDG's own browser is.
16:04:38 <CaptainPicard[m]> To expand with more information from https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
16:04:43 <CaptainPicard[m]> "Using Vanadium is highly recommended. Bromite is a solid alternative and is the only other browser we recommend. Bromite provides integrated ad-blocking and more advanced anti-fingerprinting. For now, Vanadium is more focused on security hardening and Bromite is more focused on anti-fingerprinting. The projects are collaborating together and will likely converge to providing more of the same features. Vanadium
16:04:43 <CaptainPicard[m]> will be providing content filtering and anti-fingerprinting, but it needs to be done in a way that meets the standards of the project, which takes time."
16:10:06 <ForeverNoob[m]> SchismXL: ok so I enabled oem unlocking in dev settings and enabled usb debugging but when I boot into fastboot it tells me secure boot is enabled and device state is locked. Is this normal?
16:10:33 <ForeverNoob[m]> because IIRC that should be now set to unlocked
16:10:43 <overheadscallop[> enabling oem unlock is the first step
16:10:52 <LinusSexTips[m]> I dont care too much about the adblocking, but I like that bromite has the always incognito option
16:10:53 <overheadscallop[> you need to boot into fastboot mode and run the command to unlock the device
16:11:01 <LinusSexTips[m]> since Im lazy and dont like to clear data manually
16:11:38 <CaptainPicard[m]> It's an open issue on the tracker to add that to Vanadium, but hasn't been implemented yet because there are bigger things. But yeah either is a good choice.
16:12:45 <pikey[m]> <cdesai "3a will definitely last longer t"> Thanks cdesai. Is the 3a significantly better than 3 for battery? Yes i Thought my battery wasn't performing well. yesterday I was cleaning my car (many hours!) and I was watching youtube videos (newpipe or invidious in vanadium) for several hours. I had to sit the phone on wireless charger and even then it could barely keep up, i.e. the battery stayed about where it was, it
16:12:45 <pikey[m]> was using as much juice as was going in. That ain't right!! I haven't seen the battery chart you mentioned, will look for it now.
16:13:17 <ForeverNoob[m]> <overheadscallop[ "you need to boot into fastboot m"> you mean the `fastboot flashing unlock` or `fastboot oem unlock` right? I booted into fastboot and did just that. It keeps hanging on `< waiting for any device >`
16:14:29 <pikey[m]> PS I see people talking about GCam. This is important for me if it can be used without giving up privacy. A relative of mine who i helped get onto graphene, he has just gone back to iphone very reluctantly. Mainly because he does a lot of photography and the constant camera crashes in both native cam app and Open Camera were a nightmare, plus a few other minor niggles. He now has iphone 10 with face unlock (yuk), but if
16:14:30 <pikey[m]> the camera doesn't crash any more on graphene (on Pixel4 for example) then I could bring him back to Graphene and I would like to. is this the case? Are people not getting crashing camera any more on P4 (or even P3?)

16:29:01 <skwisgaar[m]> If an app automatically updates, you are better off without f droid

16:29:23 <skwisgaar[m]> There may be a toggle for that

16:30:37 <skwisgaar[m]> Yep there's an updates section
16:30:55 <pikey[m]> well my newpipe says v 0.19.5 and no prompts to update
16:31:09 <alzxjm[m]> <pikey[m] "I was about to ask that, how do "> You have to wait for the F-Droid maintainers to build the new NewPipe package and push it to the repo.
16:31:13 <skwisgaar[m]> Did you install through github or f droid?
16:31:39 <skwisgaar[m]> You will need the github version for updates
16:32:07 <alzxjm[m]> That's a big downside of F-Droid: it contains apps that are built by the F-Droid developers, not the actual app developers. So it's signed with a different key. You can't mix an .apk downloaded from Github with an F-Droid version.;
16:32:28 <alzxjm[m]> You'll be slower to get updates for certain apps if the F-Droid maintainers don't build the app.
16:32:49 <pikey[m]> i see
16:33:01 <pikey[m]> i must have installed via Fdroid as I have never been to github on phone
16:33:09 <theultron[m]> <alzxjm[m] "That's a big downside of F-Droid"> Noticed this problem with Netguard. Netguard Github and Play Signing key is same. So you can purchase from play and restore with Github. But not with F-Droid.
16:33:15 <pikey[m]> so i need to uninstall newpipe, then get it from github, yes?
16:33:26 <skwisgaar[m]> Yep that's right
16:33:27 <theultron[m]> <pikey[m] "so i need to uninstall newpipe, "> Yes. Do export the settings first.
16:33:43 <cdesai> actually, newpipe has reproducible builds enabled now
16:33:58 <cdesai> so fdroid will also have an apk signed with the same keys once done.
16:34:18 <alzxjm[m]> cdesai: Is that reflected here?
16:34:18 <alzxjm[m]> > What’s the difference between source and binary builds?
16:34:18 <alzxjm[m]> In the client, each package for an app is labelled either ‘source’ or ‘bin’. These correspond to two different messages you’ll see for the same package when browsing the repository on the web site, either “This version is built and signed by F-Droid, and guaranteed to correspond to the source tarball below” or “This version is built and signed by the original developer.”
16:34:35 <alzxjm[m]> From their [documentation](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_General/#is-your-building-and-signing-process-secure).
16:35:56 <cdesai> yeah see https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/ - there's two entires for 0.19.6

16:52:11 <theultron[m]> I haven't used the device but they P4 comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SOC (top of the line). It is insanely fast but consumes a lot of power. Battery capacity is only 2800 mah in Pixel 4.
16:52:31 <theultron[m]> I didn't realized you were talking about P3. I was under the impression that you were talking about P3a which comes with a mid range SOC.

17:40:27 <dazinism> Trouble with removing Play is that more devices use Project Mainline. Need a way to get those security updates
17:40:36 <theultron[m]> I had a similar use case. I use an app called Join. It requires Google Sign in. (Does not work with microg). I used Google Play Services to sign in and to do the initial setup. I then removed Google Play Services using ADB and it works fine.
17:40:44 <dazinism> Also to update whatever your operating system uses for webview
17:41:10 <theultron[m]> <dazinism "Trouble with removing Play is th"> Project Mainline is still stuck on May security patches.
17:43:05 <dazinism> Best way for Project Mainline appears to be have a second user profile with Play that you use to get the OS updates (software updated in one user profile is updated in all)
17:43:22 <cn3m[m]> You can disable gapps no issue
17:43:27 <cn3m[m]> it is in the SELinux rules
17:43:59 <dazinism> theultron: I guess there hasnt been any important updates to those components?
17:46:28 <theultron[m]> Project Mainline is very very experimental at the moment. Last I checked only few devices got updated through it. Android 11 should bring some momentum.
17:46:38 <cn3m[m]> <DC[m] "Is there a list somewhere of app"> if it works with gapps off and works on Android 10 it will work
17:46:55 <SchismXL[m]> <DC[m] "Is there a list somewhere of app"> Most will, but apps that really rely on GCM won't.
17:47:28 <cn3m[m]> beside some very old apps that GrapheneOS raises the API level for and some native apps that have potential security issues uncovered
17:47:39 <SchismXL[m]> or I should say "may not", rather than won't.
17:47:40 <cn3m[m]> they is almost nothing though
17:48:06 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <DC[m] "Is there a list somewhere of app"> No, but generally, apps that have a strong dependency on Google Play Services won't work. Example: Signal works, because its only GSF dependence is the notifications, but GCam doesn't work (unless you install an app to bypass that)
17:49:50 <theultron[m]> Project Mainline didn't picked up as Google wanted. I just hope it picks up. I guess Android 11 enforces Project Mainline.
17:49:52 <theultron[m]> https://www.slashgear.com/oppo-find-x2-receive-a-graphics-driver-update-via-an-app-28630858/
17:50:07 <cn3m[m]> D~C: you disable google play services right now correct?
17:50:07 * BlackWinnerYoshi sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/esqApQeKqUpAvnYXynDqydls >
17:50:18 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "Project Mainline didn't picked u"> Android 11 doubles the modules
17:51:18 <theultron[m]> Qualcomm is decoupling graphics drivers for their chips going ahead. So should be good.
17:53:19 <switchdominion[m> Anyone have any experience running Orbot on GOS?
17:53:56 <Knull[m]> do u use orbot for anything outside of fdroid?
17:54:20 <switchdominion[m> Accessing hidden services.
17:55:03 <switchdominion[m> I don't usually use use exit nodes.
17:55:27 <switchdominion[m>  * I don't usually use exit nodes.
17:56:53 <Knull[m]> oh
17:59:09 <switchdominion[m> I was setting up Orbot and an i2p router on my Pixel 4 and ran into issues with both. Orbot will say it's starting and never move past that and the java implementation of the i2p router has a known issue on Android.
17:59:49 <switchdominion[m> Even tried using a bridged connection for Tor but no dice.
18:01:21 <ShortRound[m]> entry1: I have a Pixel 3a XL
18:01:21 <ShortRound[m]>   I literally tried Sprint last week.  Calls and SMS work but Cellular Data and MMS do not work.
18:09:32 <entry1[m]> > <@short_round:matrix.org> entry1: I have a Pixel 3a XL
18:09:32 <entry1[m]> >   I literally tried Sprint last week.  Calls and SMS work but Cellular Data and MMS do not work.
18:09:32 <entry1[m]> Thanks for the input. Personally I would never go to Sprint before everything is merged. I don't see any positives
18:09:43 <dazinism> D~C: apps that use safetynet will not work on GrapheneOS. Some banking apps, Pokemon go (Snapchat if I remember right?)
18:10:01 <cn3m[m]> Sprint is not supported by GrapheneOS as they require crap installed
18:10:04 <cn3m[m]> they are the worst
18:14:45 <entry1[m]> T-Mobile and MVNOs on their network just seem to be the best value all around and they have great coverage for the most part
18:17:04 <dazinism> switchdominion: I use orbot without issues. What version are you using?
18:18:01 <switchdominion[m> The latest on F-Droid I believe - 16.3.0-RC-1-tor-0.4.2.7.1630200100
18:19:14 <switchdominion[m> Tried downgrading just to see if it would work but it says the version is incompatible
18:19:50 <dazinism> That should work OK
18:20:48 <dazinism> Wonder if you have any network stuff on device that could be blocking it?
18:21:22 <dazinism> Have you checked the logs as it tries to connect?
18:21:45 <dazinism> Swipe across from right edge
18:21:58 <switchdominion[m> Yes, it just says Orbot is starting
18:22:32 <switchdominion[m> If I stop it and restart the app, it will show a message "Waiting for control port..." but never moves past that.
18:36:12 <switchdominion[m> Checked for warnings using adb and got:
18:36:12 <switchdominion[m> `07-30 14:34:48.914   536   536 W project.android: type=1400 audit(0.0:39023): avc: denied { setattr } for name="libobfs4proxy.so" dev="dm-7" ino=26256 scontext=u:r:untrusted_app:s0:c128,c256,c512,c768 tcontext=u:object_r:apk_data_file:s0 tclass=file permissive=0`
18:36:41 <switchdominion[m> When I tried starting Orbot
18:38:02 <switchdominion[m> Which stood out to me because the previous log entries had `avc: granted { execute } ...`.
18:38:30 <switchdominion[m> For different libraries.
18:41:39 <switchdominion[m> Might this be an SELinux  issue? I'm only getting these denied statuses on libraries with permissive=0.
18:45:21 <rickza[m]> > permitted delay: 48 hours
18:45:21 <rickza[m]> > verify interval hours: 4
18:46:32 <rickza[m]> I have the same settings but still keep on getting emails that the "The following devices have failed to provide valid attestations before the expiry time:"
18:47:17 <pikey[m]> I exported newpipe settings. I went to github and downloaded 0.19.8. I go to file and tap but it won't open. Try open with and nothing happens. Why won't it run?
18:56:07 <pikey[m]> PS its an apk of course
18:57:48 <BlackWinnerYoshi> pikey: maybe try using a different file manager?
19:00:14 <pikey[m]> ha, didn't know you could! but i have installed APKs before, surely the native file manager should be able to run an apk? I downloaded 3 in total, 0.19.8, 7 and 6. none of them will run. back to fdroid i think
19:01:22 <BlackWinnerYoshi> I don't know, maybe try using a different file manager like Simple File Manager Pro, or open those APKs directly from the browser you just downloaded them from, like I did
19:01:28 <pikey[m]> in case its relevant, i have a file called "com.apkmirror.helper.prod_1......" which is a pain in the ass,. It wont run (unable to parse) and it wont delete, which is very unsettling!
19:01:48 <pikey[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "I don't know, maybe try using a "> i could try from browser, trhats an idea. thanks
19:02:08 <pikey[m]> actually no i can't as browser doesn't have option
19:02:10 <pikey[m]> no matter
19:03:11 <pikey[m]> ha. genius!
19:03:19 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pikey[m] "actually no i can't as browser d"> It does, you just need to click "Run" in the popup that appears after downloading an APK
19:03:23 <pikey[m]> I was using DDG browser. I went to github in Vanadium instead and it worked from there.
19:03:48 <switchdominion[m> For anyone interested, the apk for Orbot on the Play store and F-Droid was out of date. Had to get it from the Guardian Project website.
19:03:55 <pikey[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "It does, you just need to click "> yeah I didn't get any popups, crappy browser! i like it for the burn tabs/data feature, and homepage search widget. but will probably delete if its going to be that dumb :D
19:05:02 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pikey[m] "I was using DDG browser. I went "> Oh, that's a different story then. Although, I wouldn't advise using DDG browser, or DDG at all. It's best to use Random Searx Redirector as your search engine: https://searx.neocities.org - this gives decentralization
19:06:29 <pikey[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Oh, that's a different story the"> not sure what the benefits are to that but will have a look
19:09:01 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pikey[m] "not sure what the benefits are t"> Well, it's kind of like the Fediverse social media, like Mastodon: you can follow anyone, even if a server runs on completely different software, like Pleroma, and it's thanks to the ActivityPub protocol. In Searx, it's similar: you can get benefits from various search engines, all at once, with privacy protection.
19:09:41 <pikey[m]> blimey, that was like reading a foreign language :D
19:10:03 <pikey[m]> thanks, i just want Google results, more privately than getting them from Google.
19:13:39 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pikey[m] "thanks, i just want Google resul"> Well, in that case, Startpage.com should do it. Although, do note that it has been aquired by the US-based System1 (source: https://support.startpage.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/1277/0/startpage-ceo-robert-beens-discusses-the-investment-from-privacy-one--system1)
19:16:42 <SchismXL[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Well, in that case, Startpage.co"> Also recommended by privacytools.io, if that means anything.
19:17:33 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <SchismXL[m] "Also recommended by privacytools"> Yeah, that's where I took the warning from
19:19:11 <kuantem[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Oh, that's a different story the"> Why would you not recommend DDG?
19:20:32 <pikey[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Also recommended by privacytools"> I have used startpage, i tend to prefer DDG results/layout but startpage is good too. PTIO isn't something I am interested in taking any heed from any more, for reasons I won't go into.
19:20:50 <pikey[m]> thanks though, I can't say I much like Vanadium but its recommended and I tend to stick to guidance (As i need to :D)
19:20:58 <pikey[m]> bromite someone recommended which i keep meaning to lok into
19:21:03 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <kuantem[m] "Why would you not recommend DDG?"> Well, DDG is centralized, unlike Searx, and there has been a privacy concern about DDG recently
19:21:18 <cn3m[m]> searx is technically centralized
19:21:23 <pikey[m]> haha :D
19:21:24 <cn3m[m]> you are using a search provider
19:21:32 <cn3m[m]> who can see everything
19:21:39 <cn3m[m]> all search has to be
19:21:52 <cn3m[m]> DDG and searx pulls from multiple sources
19:22:04 <pikey[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Well, DDG is centralized, unlike"> i often hear this "its centralized", and i get the point, but i think its often used to mean "bad" when it needn't necessarily mean that. depends on use case i guess
19:22:05 <cn3m[m]> but ddg has it's own crawler
19:22:05 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <pikey[m] "bromite someone recommended whic"> Yeah, Bromite is an acceptable alternative to Vanadium, if you want to use ad blocking and stuff.
19:22:05 <kuantem[m]> First time hearing about searx
19:22:05 <kuantem[m]> I'll look intocot
19:22:18 <kuantem[m]> * I'll look into it
19:22:22 <pikey[m]> i need google's 'centralised' serps, but ideally with a front end to prevent google tracking me too much. but not too concerned, VPN helps also
19:22:42 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <cn3m[m] "searx is technically centralized"> But it's libre software, using the AGPL-3.0 license, and everyone can self-host it
19:22:45 <pikey[m]> <cn3m[m] "but ddg has it's own crawler "> yes i thought i had heard that myself
19:22:57 <cn3m[m]> you don't want to self host search

19:24:17 <pikey[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Why Searx being AGPL-3.0 license"> because i don't know, and you didn't explain if it was a pro or a con
19:24:31 <pikey[m]> "libre" - DDG costs me nothing. "can self host" - like i would ever want (or know how) to do that :D

20:06:45 <kuantem[m]> I'm confused. I'll have to do some reading on this.
20:07:13 <kuantem[m]> If tor doesn't recommend it, then who is countering Tor's opinion of their own product?
20:08:53 <Knull[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Run a VPN, then use tor browser?"> that's all it is, yeah. VPN layers of encryption around tor's, ISP doesn't see tor connectivity, ur golden
20:09:41 <Knull[m]> safer going into entry nodes, makes no difference in exit nodes though
20:11:56 <international> thank you will follow that and other advice for things i should do from the start after install
20:35:05 <international> is it a good idea to use dns.adguard.com as private DNS
20:37:27 <international> currently i'm using one.one.one.one
20:42:33 <Knull[m]> I use quad9
20:42:44 <BlackWinnerYoshi> international: Yes, use AdGuard DNS instead of Cloudflare. Cloudflare is really bad: https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor
20:49:53 <international> thank you for the advice
20:50:51 <nightjar[m]> <Knull[m] "raw Tor is unwise, encrypt to en"> I believe Tor encrypts communication from you to the Guard node. As for the benefit of using a VPN to disquise Tor from your ISP, I just read this recently:  https://matt.traudt.xyz/posts/vpn-tor-not-mRikAa4h.html
20:53:47 * Knull[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gryoMqyrWnuxjDJmjKYoHnlE >
20:55:03 <Knull[m]> bridges are for activists in strict countries like China and N Korea where their internet is highly restricted
20:57:25 <nightjar[m]> Only if it fits your threat model. For many people, there's nothing wrong with simply connecting to Tor.
20:57:42 <nightjar[m]> Directly that is
20:59:24 <Knull[m]> you're right, threat model is important context. I'm speaking on that hiding from ISP but nothing as high profile as needing to use bridges. vpn is good enough and this take that it's a "bad idea" is plain wrong
21:00:12 <Knull[m]> as in, it's not harmful unless you don't trust ur vpn
21:02:59 <international> can please some confirm for how to setup ad guard dns  i just go to DNS settings and write DNS,adguard.com
21:03:44 <nightjar[m]> Write dns.adguard.com
21:08:11 <international> i tested with both one.one.one.one and dns.adguard.com and tested with 1.1.1.1/help  the dns.aduard.com still showed my AS name as same as my ISP with i used one.one.one.one it showed cloud flare
21:08:41 <international> does that mean it's better one or it's irrelevant and i should test it in other way
21:41:37 <dazinism> international: check out the community wiki  https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Home
22:05:26 <nightjar[m]> <Knull[m] "you're right, threat model is im"> Perhaps if you don't want to use bridges or pluggable transports and still want to hide your Tor usage from your ISP a VPN is helpful, but a VPN is still another layer of trust, and they can know that you are using Tor. Your VPN's datacenter and their ISP are also parties involved. An adversary large or powerful enough to approach that of a Global Passive Adversary as
22:05:26 <nightjar[m]> explained in that article could likely see the traffic going in and out of the VPN as well, and that makes hiding your Tor usage from your ISP mostly useless. I can't really think of a threat model that would justify hiding the Tor usage from the ISP but not from a VPN provider, unless you're trying to get around firewalls or throttling and don't want to use bridges or pluggable transports, or your adversary is
22:05:26 <nightjar[m]> limited or incompetent.
22:05:57 <nightjar[m]> Governmental adversary* in the last sentence
22:26:26 <Knull[m]> <nightjar[m] "Perhaps if you don't want to use"> as I stated just after that, you wouldn't do this if you trust your VPN any less than your isp.
22:29:56 <izymandias[m]> Is masking cellular triangulation something people are working towards or is this just apart of our lives now?
22:31:24 <cn3m[m]> <izymandias[m] "Is masking cellular triangulatio"> just don't use a sim and use VoIP bought privately
22:31:39 <cn3m[m]> you can't dodge physics since you don't like it
22:32:14 <izymandias[m]> cn3m: what do you mean bought privately?
22:32:53 <cn3m[m]> if you are really worried about texting and calling privately
22:32:57 <izymandias[m]> and i need a 4G connection to use VOIP
22:33:24 <Knull[m]> I'm in the boat of not having a sim. But currently rely on wifi
22:34:02 <izymandias[m]> Knull: so you dont use your phone when you leave the house?
22:35:54 <Knull[m]> I can't, not with my graphene. I still have my Samsung that I'm not fully migrated off of
22:36:36 <izymandias[m]> cn3m: what good is it then if you can only use it at home
22:36:58 <izymandias[m]> sorry meant for Knull:
22:39:21 <Knull[m]> oh. Just getting used to not having Google, learning to migrate. Requiring taking my Samsung with me places.. I'm just in the same boat as you. I was going to switch my sim into this phone cuz I didn't think there was a good solution
22:40:29 <izymandias[m]> cn3m: ive asked this question before and you always give a vague reply. Is Graphene doing anything to combat cellular location tracking? is this something that can only be defeated with legislation
22:40:57 <izymandias[m]> Knull: fair enough dude
22:42:03 <cn3m[m]> <izymandias[m] "cn3m: ive asked this question be"> yes airplane mode
22:42:06 <cn3m[m]> turn it on
22:42:08 <cn3m[m]> it works
22:44:43 <Knull[m]> and off goes your hypothetical VoIP signal powered by mobile data
22:45:41 <izymandias[m]> is he deliberately dodging the question you think
22:46:39 <izymandias[m]> i mean ive worded it pretty clearly
22:47:02 <Knull[m]> it's probably just not possible
22:47:19 <izymandias[m]> but why doesnt he just say that then
22:49:18 <nightjar[m]> <izymandias[m] "is he deliberately dodging the q"> There's no real good way to avoid the inherent privacy problems with the cellular network and still use it from the client's perspective. Airplane mode on a competently designed SoC and correct software should prevent any communication with the cellular network, which otherwise happens whether you have a SIM card or not.
22:49:58 <nightjar[m]> So by turning on airplane mode, you are avoiding giving away your location to the cellular network and service provider
22:51:04 <nightjar[m]> You can always use public WiFi, and WiFi anonymity on Graphene is nearly perfect.
22:51:43 <izymandias[m]> nightjar: i know! what is the point of buying a mobile phone if youre not gonna use it outside of the house or whereever there is WiFi
22:52:40 <izymandias[m]> why not just channel all your efforts towards making the desktop more secure...if cellular tracking is something that cant be escaped
22:53:25 <cn3m[m]> izymandias: you want a service from cellular compnies
22:53:32 <cn3m[m]> take it or leave it
22:53:42 <nightjar[m]> <izymandias[m] "nightjar: i know! what is the po"> You're essentially buying a modern PDA. Many things will still work, such as offline maps and location (based solely on the GPS currently). Traditional calls can be made via a Google Voice-like service
22:53:43 <cn3m[m]> I gave you two good options
22:53:53 <cn3m[m]> VoIP or use Airplane Mode when you don't need it
22:54:03 <JTL> nightjar[m]: ^^
22:54:09 <cn3m[m]> you want to defy physics
22:55:09 <JTL> Physics you say?
22:55:12 <JTL> https://xkcd.com/793/
22:55:56 <cn3m[m]> xD
22:56:11 <nightjar[m]> Also, you could have a SIM card installed and use Airplane Mode most of the time, and only turn on the cellular network when you're willing to sacrifice your location's privacy for the convenience of mobile internet or in an emergency.
22:56:36 <cn3m[m]> cell is a feature you can choose to use or not
22:56:52 <cn3m[m]> that is like asking why GrapheneOS installs apps if apps could spy on you
22:57:20 <izymandias[m]> cn3m: so people are just better off not getting the pixel and installing Graphene cause there is nothing that can be done about cellular tracking...which basically makes the OS redundant.
22:57:51 <cn3m[m]> <izymandias[m] "cn3m: so people are just better "> I gave two perfectly good ways to get around the issue
22:57:52 <cn3m[m]> it is a feature offered
22:57:54 <cn3m[m]> you have read nothing I said
22:58:11 <cn3m[m]> do you have the option of communications anywhere you go on your desktop? No
22:58:28 <cn3m[m]> having cellular is a feature you can choose to use or not
22:58:44 <cn3m[m]> if the project removed everything remotely harmful there would be no third party apps
22:58:48 <izymandias[m]> nightjar: thats just an unrealistic way of using a mobile. what good is it if people cant contact you.
22:58:49 <cn3m[m]> no web browser
22:59:28 <cn3m[m]> izymandias: you do realize cellular triangulation isn't going to let them hack you or read your signal messages or break your encryption right?
22:59:46 <cn3m[m]> a desktop isn't going to what you are looking for nothing is
23:00:09 <cn3m[m]> if you want a secure mobile use GrapheneOS and make your own decisions about cellular
23:00:37 * cn3m[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ssMKEdXQZFtFByasyNOHirpp >
23:03:21 <cn3m[m]> saying GrapheneOS is useless since it doesn't allow you to defy physics is like saying Qubes is useless since your friend can videotape you using it and then log in
23:04:17 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is very careful about the devices chosen for wifi and bluetooth connection privacy
23:04:28 <izymandias[m]> cn3m: isnt the whole point of the project to try and  protect peoples right to privacy. Hey Install our OS cause then you wont be hacked...but you'll still be tracked and theres nothing we can do about that.
23:05:10 <cn3m[m]> <izymandias[m] "cn3m: isnt the whole point of th"> Okay so GrapheneOS is useless since it doesn't have an army of nanobots to kill anyone who tries to record you using your device?
23:06:09 <izymandias[m]> Yes, thats my point. its basically redundant.
23:06:11 <cn3m[m]> You should make a GitHub issue suggesting GrapheneOS have killer nanobots that can detect cameras
23:06:20 <cn3m[m]> okay so is any computing platform
23:06:23 <cn3m[m]> so is the internet
23:08:05 <cn3m[m]> when GrapheneOS has nanobots that kill people who spy on you and it's own third communications network(beside the 2 offered with excellent privacy and security already) I will send you a letter that you can start using the internet again
23:08:32 <cn3m[m]> the lawyers will get busy on making it legal to kill people for spying on you
23:08:39 <cn3m[m]> I'd say give it 10 years
23:08:44 <izymandias[m]> its expensive to send spy's
23:09:52 <cn3m[m]> what is your point?
23:10:10 <cn3m[m]> seriously you can use airplane mode if you want more of a desktop experience, but more secure
23:10:22 <cn3m[m]> you can use cellular if triangulation doesn't bother you
23:10:31 <cn3m[m]> you can mix and match as you see fit
23:10:46 <izymandias[m]> so your point is, because there are CCTV cameras everywhere privacy isnt something that can be achieved
23:10:49 <izymandias[m]> ?
23:11:34 <cn3m[m]> I am saying GrapheneOS has a solution for cell triangulation and CCTV, but you don't like the cellular solution since it is not convenient for you
23:11:49 <cn3m[m]> Airplane mode does the trick
23:15:50 <wreck[m]> wait, are we getting killer nanobots?
23:15:51 <wreck[m]> nice
23:19:45 <cn3m[m]> <wreck[m] "wait, are we getting killer nano"> yeah of course why else would the project exist?
23:20:08 <wreck[m]> ETA? 🤣
23:21:43 <cn3m[m]> 1984
23:30:43 <Knull[m]> <cn3m[m] "when GrapheneOS has nanobots tha"> did you get his address to be able to send him that letter?
23:31:17 <cn3m[m]> <Knull[m] "did you get his address to be ab"> no he is in the offtopic room talking to me now..
23:32:11 <Knull[m]> oh I still gotta get on that.
23:49:47 <Wonderfall[m]> I'm planning to go on a vacation and I just realised my Pixel 3a cannot read my 2TB drive formatted in exFAT. Well it seems it's up to the OEM (Google in that case) to include or not the driver, until it would be natively supported by Linux.
23:49:47 <Wonderfall[m]> What are my options here? FAT32 is not an option due to the file limit. I'm desperately looking for an app or something... Otherwise I just have to borrow my Macbook with me the whole time. I'm afraid there's nothing I can do, just asking.
23:57:00 <wreck[m]> ext4?
23:57:04 <wreck[m]> NTFS?
23:58:15 <wreck[m]> someone correct me if those aren't supported in graphene. i'm assuming this is over usb, otherwise you could use a network transfer protocol like ssh/scp, ftp, smb, etc
23:58:57 <Knull[m]> i thought ntfs wasn't
