00:44:19 <strcat[m]> well you need to set up PATH properly
00:44:22 <strcat[m]> if ./fastboot works it sounds like you're already in the platform-tools directory
00:44:30 <strcat[m]> which wasn't what the instructions say to do
00:44:47 <strcat[m]> if you're already in the directory then you need to use just $pwd not $pwd\platform-tools because you're already in that directory
00:44:53 <strcat[m]> I'd recommend following the instructions to the letter
00:45:14 <strcat[m]> or do `cd ..` to move out of the directory
00:45:25 <strcat[m]> the issue is improvising and doing things a different way
00:45:38 <strcat[m]> you should only do that if you're familiar with the command-line and know what you're doing
00:45:51 <strcat[m]> otherwise follow the instructions precisely, don't run any command it doesn't tell you to run, etc.
00:46:00 <strcat[m]> do it all in a single terminal session

07:29:17 <furofuro_01[m]> Or is it simply outshone by the hardening and privacy implementations of Bromite and Vanadium?
07:34:09 <mxnorvak[m]> If I'm not mistaking Bromite is only available for Android and Ungoogled chromium is only for Windows, MacOS and Linux so their use cases are different
07:36:54 <furofuro_01[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "If I'm not mistaking Bromite is "> There is one for android
07:37:30 <furofuro_01[m]> Yeah, I mean there is Bromite on android. There is also ungoogled-chromium-android whoch apparently support extensikns
07:37:50 <furofuro_01[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "If I'm not mistaking Bromite is "> That's what I knew before
07:38:00 <furofuro_01[m]> Until I checked ungoogled chromium github again

07:52:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Welp... Yeah, Bromite is indeed bettr
08:01:13 <mxnorvak[m]> <furofuro_01[m] "There is one for android "> Oh, didn't know that
08:56:44 <furofuro_01[m]> Also, good news in ungoogled-chromium-android
08:56:51 <furofuro_01[m]> It now support extensions
08:57:02 <furofuro_01[m]> Albeit experimental
08:58:30 <dazinism> Was just reading issues in ungoogled chromium
08:59:43 <dazinism> Saw that extensions dont work unless you grant it 'install unknown apps'
09:00:34 <dazinism> Didnt realise that gave apps extra permission to execute stuff without user intervention
09:02:37 <dazinism> Thought it was just an extra layer/warning to stop folks who dont know what they are doing being fooled into installing dodgy apks
09:02:44 <furofuro_01[m]> <dazinism "Saw that extensions dont work un"> Welp
09:03:24 <furofuro_01[m]> Yeah, there are some extension-related bugs
09:03:27 <furofuro_01[m]> (Esp. uBlock0)
09:05:48 <dazinism> Its early days for extensions in android chromium. But appears theres a fair bit of interest in getting them working properly from various projects
09:08:22 <dazinism> Should clarify have to grant chromium 'install unknown apps'
09:13:09 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: is that on the stable version or a test version?
09:13:37 <furofuro_01[m]> <cn3m[m] "dazinism: is that on the stable "> Not yet stable
09:14:38 <dazinism> cn3m: havent tried it, just reading issues on github
09:14:38 <cn3m[m]> Interesting, I'm worried that they have to butcher the sandbox to run then
09:15:03 <cn3m[m]> * Interesting, I'm worried that they have to butcher the sandbox to run them
09:16:02 <dazinism> The need for giving chromium 'install unknown apps'   permission is only for Android 10+
09:16:45 <dazinism> I don't grant this permission to browsers
09:17:06 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "The need for giving chromium 'in"> So the only version of Android worth noting?
09:17:29 <dazinism> lol, I guess
09:17:39 <dazinism> Unless you are poor
09:18:32 <dazinism> Its possible to not grant 'install unknown apps' anywhere
09:19:06 <dazinism> Can install apks via the built in File manager
09:20:29 <dazinism> Although somewhat annoyingly if you look a the recent or downloads it is as if you are using the app to hat you downloaded the apk with
09:21:58 <dazinism> Need to view your internal / shared storage and tap on the apk there
09:23:29 <dazinism> All a bit confusing
09:28:54 <cn3m[m]> I had a weird conversation on Reddit and it got me thinking
09:31:24 <cn3m[m]> How important is Apple's long support window. Apple devices on average get 6 years of support. However, the OS, webview, browser, and most apps are tied to the latest iOS version. This is simply not true on Android where you can get all those things updated easily back to Android 5. Google Play Store probably isn't going to let known exploits slip through. Android 5 is 6 years old.
09:32:53 <cn3m[m]> If Apple drops support for a device it's totally wide open store and browsing wise. Zero security. If they did any less than 6 years it could make them look bad in real long term security comparisons
09:33:24 <dazinism> Yeah guess an out of support android is better
09:34:06 <cn3m[m]> With the iPhone 5s and 6s both getting 7 years of support and the iPhone 6 getting 6 the new norm is set where iPhones just can't be beat long term.
09:34:30 <dazinism> Although something like LineageOS where webview is updated with the OS looses webview updates when LineageOS support is dropped
09:34:33 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Yeah guess an out of support and"> Yeah, but Apple supports a device fully longer than the Google Play Store supports a device which is ironic
09:35:46 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Although something like LineageO"> Really would be off the table giving up verified boot and play store on a device that old
09:37:23 <cn3m[m]> In all fairness most Android devices do get 1 update. Android 4.4 phones from 7 years ago could be rocking Android 5 with the latest Chrome and latest apps. With verified boot(not a great mode though).
09:37:36 <dazinism> Yeah Apple wins for longevity
09:37:52 <cn3m[m]> It's just impressive how far back Apple goes. They support OSes longer than Android apps are supported
09:38:15 <dazinism> I tried helping a friend with a battery replacement on an old(ish) iphone
09:38:29 <dazinism> Was really fiddly
09:39:32 <dazinism> After hours of trying ti get it all together turned out the third party battery didnt work
09:39:44 <cn3m[m]> iPhone 11 Pro got a 6/10 from iFixIt and that's the most waterproof phone in the world(iirc)
09:39:59 <cn3m[m]> Things are getting better there
09:40:03 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "After hours of trying ti get it "> That's terrible
09:40:29 <dazinism> It was...... frustrating
09:40:40 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "In all fairness most Android dev"> No, they don't have enough memory to install updates
09:41:08 <dazinism> I've never really spent any time on an iPhone
09:41:33 <EssentialChaos[m> > No, they don't have enough memory to install updates
09:41:33 <EssentialChaos[m> Maybe flagships do, but not others
09:41:38 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "No, they don't have enough memor"> What do you mean?
09:41:53 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "What do you mean?"> Literally what it sounds like
09:42:03 <EssentialChaos[m> Not enough space to install updates
09:42:22 <dazinism> I got a cheap Alcatel burner for a job a few years back was Â£20
09:42:23 <dazinism> New
09:42:26 <EssentialChaos[m> Those devices have like 8Gbs of memory
09:42:34 <cn3m[m]> Android's usually get one OS update in my experience that far back
09:42:36 <dazinism> Ran out of storage pretty quick
09:42:56 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Android's usually get one OS upd"> I hope mine gets 11
09:43:04 <dazinism> Loads of preinstalled apps I didnt want
09:43:36 <cn3m[m]> The Nokia 1.3 will get Android 12 or 13 and it has 1gb ram and is under $100
09:44:19 <dazinism> cn3m: did you hear the Nokia horror story in this room?
09:44:20 <cn3m[m]> EssentialChaos: what phone?
09:44:57 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "EssentialChaos: what phone?"> Galaxy Grand Prime
09:44:58 <dazinism> Nokia 7.1 Feb update bricks phone
09:45:10 <dazinism> Still not fixed

09:46:12 <dazinism> They blaming Corona. Which is kind of an excuse, but still terrible.
09:47:16 <cn3m[m]> Ouch, they have a decent enough track record the Corona pass might work
09:47:18 <dazinism> > That sounds terrible
09:47:19 <dazinism> Sounds amazing. What does it transform into?
09:47:59 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Galaxy Grand Prime"> What's your daily driver?
09:48:36 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "What's your daily driver?"> That was my old phone, current is Mi 9T
09:48:42 <EssentialChaos[m> Although, one of my family members still has another Grand Prime
09:48:46 <EssentialChaos[m> Which is dying
09:49:27 <cn3m[m]> EssentialChaos: dang you need a new phone badly
09:49:35 <EssentialChaos[m> Yeah
09:49:35 <mxnorvak[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "That was my old phone, current i"> Mi 9T pro here ^-^
09:49:42 <EssentialChaos[m> But Pixels are unavailable
09:49:49 <EssentialChaos[m> And they won't go for an iPhone
09:50:09 <cn3m[m]> You guys need Pixels or iPhones
09:50:20 <EssentialChaos[m> And, tbh, I wouldn't go for an iPhone of that price either
09:50:25 <mxnorvak[m]> I know, waiting for 4a
09:50:29 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "And they won't go for an iPhone"> Even an SE?
09:50:53 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Even an SE?"> SE is expensive
09:50:55 <EssentialChaos[m> The budget is about $280
09:51:52 <cn3m[m]> You shouldn't by a phone for under $400 imo ever
09:52:00 <EssentialChaos[m> Actually, you could say ~$300
09:52:18 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "You shouldn't by a phone for und"> Well, that's great
09:52:25 <EssentialChaos[m> But money is a problem
09:52:30 <cn3m[m]> Maybe if it starts at that and is discounted heavily like a 3a going for $300
09:53:19 <cn3m[m]> iPhone SE is $80 a year a $280 phone is double that
09:53:22 <cn3m[m]> iPhone is the cheapest option for people like your family
09:53:29 <furofuro_01[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Actually, you could say ~$300"> cn3m: where do you love though

09:54:54 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "My family is in Russia"> Used iPhone 8?
09:55:22 <cn3m[m]> Apple is really pushing to that 6-7 range of support lately. iPhone 8 by that standard could be 3.5-4.5 left
09:55:34 <EssentialChaos[m> As I said, they won't go for an iPhone
09:55:52 <EssentialChaos[m> And, tbh, SE feels actually underwhelming
09:56:13 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "And, tbh, SE feels actually unde"> So, what would be with 8?
09:56:13 <cn3m[m]> I guess burned in Pixel 3?
09:56:19 <xabi[m]> > But money is a problem
09:56:19 <xabi[m]> pixel 3a is for 240â¬ in aliexpress. If money is a problem realme does really good entry level phones for around 200â¬.
09:56:54 <EssentialChaos[m> They want to go for Galaxy A50
09:57:23 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "They want to go for Galaxy A50"> No no no
09:57:36 <furofuro_01[m]> Sorry couldnt help you with store recommendations
09:57:42 <cn3m[m]> A50 has quarterly updates only

09:57:48 <EssentialChaos[m> I may try and convince them to go for Motorolla

09:59:28 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Afaik, most Motorola phones are like Android One except for one preinstalled app
09:59:36 <cn3m[m]> That's my go to hierarchy
10:00:04 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Why Nokia > Motorolla"> Motorola loves MediaTek which is garbage and it has only 2 years updates
10:00:40 <cn3m[m]> Nokia is a better budget phone for security imo. Even though I trust Motorola to design a better phone security wise generally at higher price points
10:00:41 <EssentialChaos[m> Iirc, Motorola G8 runs a snapdragon
10:00:44 <furofuro_01[m]> A curious thought...
10:00:44 <furofuro_01[m]> Is there some potential privacy and security risk when a hardware is made of China (like Pixels)?
10:00:57 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Iirc, Motorola G8 runs a snapdra"> And, I think, it should pretty cheap

10:02:01 <cn3m[m]> > Is there some potential privacy and security risk when a hardware is made of China (like Pixels)?
10:02:01 <cn3m[m]> Pixels will move to Vietnam with the 4a and 5 iirc. However it's probably not a major concern. The firmware is made and signed in the US and they wouldn't risk a hardware redesign which would be expensive
10:02:23 <EssentialChaos[m> Aren't the SoCs made in Taiwan?
10:02:26 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Iirc, Motorola G8 runs a snapdra"> Just make sure it's not too old that it burns through a good chunk of the 2 years
10:02:46 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Just make sure it's not too old "> I think, it's from last year
10:02:49 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Aren't the SoCs made in Taiwan?"> The Fab is
10:02:56 <EssentialChaos[m> I'll look into it a bit more
10:03:56 <cn3m[m]> I would get a Nokia. I think the almost entirely Qualcomm lineup, 3 years, and the non Chinese ownership are just too appealing
10:04:20 <cn3m[m]> Nokia is far from perfect, but you can get a Qualcomm phone with 3 years support for less than $100 new and it's not Chinese
10:04:21 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "I would get a Nokia. I think the"> I considered Nokia 7.2
10:04:31 <EssentialChaos[m> But with that update now...
10:04:37 <cn3m[m]> That's worth saying something
10:05:35 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "But with that update now..."> The X.3 series replaces the X.2 so it will be supported a year longer r
10:05:57 <cn3m[m]> I'd get a something dot 3
10:06:13 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "The X.3 series replaces the X.2 "> But that will probably several months later this year, no?
10:06:18 <EssentialChaos[m> > <@cn3m:privacytools.io> The X.3 series replaces the X.2 so it will be supported a year longer r
10:06:18 <EssentialChaos[m>  * But that will probably be several months later this year, no?
10:06:43 <jalb66> cn3m[m], I hope your Nokia will work well with the updates and their problems.. Not mine.
10:07:28 <cn3m[m]> To put it in perspective the Nokia 7.1 missed enough monthlies to be equivalent to what a brand new A50 misses between every update. It's really not a big deal at that price point and their excuse is good enough
10:07:32 <jalb66> My Nokia 7.1 is 3-4 months dead now... without updating it or it fails
10:07:52 <cn3m[m]> I mean I don't like Nokia and I don't like cheap phones, but you have to be realistic
10:08:39 <EssentialChaos[m> Hmmm, I don't see 7.3 on their website
10:08:46 <jalb66> It's a great phone but HMD Global is not doing it well
10:08:51 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "My Nokia 7.1 is 3-4 months dead "> See my point about the Samsung A50 you really don't have it bad at all. That's a $400 phone and it's brand new and they do Quarterlies and it's not a one off thing
10:08:52 <EssentialChaos[m> It's 1.3, 2.3, 5.3 and 8.3
10:09:12 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Hmmm, I don't see 7.3 on their w"> I think they only have the 1.3, 2.3, 3.3, and 9.3 out
10:09:31 <cn3m[m]> Oh gotcha
10:09:56 <cn3m[m]> I'd check the 5.3 and 8.3
10:10:00 <EssentialChaos[m> That's what I am doing right now
10:10:13 <EssentialChaos[m> What was Snapdragon 665 released in?
10:11:02 <cn3m[m]> Samsung A50 makes the Nokia 7.1 hiccup look like nothing. Avoid anything besides Samsung S(which means you can afford a real phone like a Pixel or iPhone)
10:11:13 <jalb66> I won't buy a Nokia phone again...
10:11:23 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "What was Snapdragon 665 released"> I have a 670 in my 3a
10:11:32 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "I have a 670 in my 3a"> 5.3 has a 665
10:11:42 <EssentialChaos[m> Iirc 7.2 had 665 too
10:12:10 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "I won't buy a Nokia phone again."> Okay then you're stuck with Pixel or iPhone or a super expensive Samsung if you want better
10:14:20 <jalb66> cn3m[m], well, I bought the Pixel 3a and I installed GOS recently ð
10:14:32 <cn3m[m]> Really missing 4 months of security patches once and providing good monthly the rest of the time while everyone else is doing quarterlies is more of a sign of how good you have it
10:14:56 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "cn3m, well, I bought the Pixel 3"> Well that's a lot better ð
10:15:03 <jalb66> Yes!
10:17:00 <jalb66> cn3m[m], I'm waiting a solution from Nokia to update my smartphone again, we are many people waiting some months now, and the mobile is full of bugs and different problems...

10:18:16 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "cn3m, I'm waiting a solution fro"> Yeah a 4 month delay is a bug on Nokia it's a feature on a Galaxy A. You're missing my point
10:18:38 <jalb66> Ah, I understand ð
10:19:00 <cn3m[m]> Android One is orders of magnitude better than any of the rest of the crap floating out there
10:19:02 <jalb66> So, Samsung is even worse???
10:19:16 <jalb66> cn3m[m], yes!, that's true, of course
10:19:24 <cn3m[m]> Even if they have occasional issues like this it pales in comparison
10:19:26 <jalb66> I disabled all the google apps and all was ok
10:19:28 <EssentialChaos[m> Is there any particularly good reason for holding back on security updates?
10:19:47 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "So, Samsung is even worse???"> Look at their support page. They only care about the S line
10:19:54 <jalb66> Only the phone with the persistent notification that you're not using Google services, it can't be disabled, nothing more
10:20:32 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Is there any particularly good r"> Device breaking bug and coronavirus I guess
10:20:33 <dazinism> EssentialChaos: not having to pay enough developers to release on time?
10:20:49 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "Only the phone with the persiste"> It can be at least on my Pixel
10:21:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Device breaking bug and coronavi"> But I mean, companies did it even before coronavirus
10:21:14 <jalb66> cn3m[m], that's ok, no problem, even I installed an app to hide that notification
10:21:21 <EssentialChaos[m> For example, why does Xiaomi stay a month late on security updates?
10:21:32 <cn3m[m]> Let me put it this way Android One is to the average Android phone what GrapheneOS is to Android One.
10:21:36 <cn3m[m]> Android One is terrible, but it's much better
10:22:00 <EssentialChaos[m> Why doesn't Samsung release them every month?
10:22:01 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "For example, why does Xiaomi sta"> Android One is different
10:22:18 <cn3m[m]> Android One has a deal with Google. 2 years of OS and monthly security updates
10:22:35 <jalb66> cn3m[m], I also think that Xiaomi had an Android One smartphone
10:22:40 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Why doesn't Samsung release them"> They do for the S line
10:23:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <jalb66 "cn3m, I also think that Xiaomi h"> The Mi A series
10:23:06 <cn3m[m]> The M and A lines they don't care about
10:23:45 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "cn3m, I also think that Xiaomi h"> The A2 or the A3 one of those?
10:23:55 <jalb66> I don't know how they work (xiaomi with Android one), maybe they are cheaper
10:24:05 <jalb66> cn3m[m], don't remember
10:24:36 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m, yes, I thikk it was that model
10:24:54 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m, yes, I think it was that model
10:27:49 <cn3m[m]> A2 runs CalyxOS
10:28:59 <jalb66> :-o
10:29:21 <jalb66> cn3m[m], supported or in beta?
10:31:07 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "cn3m, supported or in beta?"> Supported
10:31:24 <jalb66> Great
10:32:45 <jalb66> So, is it easy to unlock boot in Xiaomi and enable verified boot??
10:33:01 <jalb66> Are they allowing it?
10:34:02 <EssentialChaos[m> They allow it
10:34:23 <EssentialChaos[m> But at least on MIUI devices you need a Xiaomi account for that
10:34:24 <EssentialChaos[m> Not sure about Android ONe
10:34:24 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Not sure about Android One
10:34:44 <jalb66> i wish Nokia will allow it lol
10:35:13 <cdesai> no account needed on android one, just 'fastboot flashing unlock' like any other device
10:35:28 <EssentialChaos[m> Oh, wai, no
10:35:31 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Oh, wait, no
10:35:36 <EssentialChaos[m> They don't allow verified boot on MIUI devices
10:35:47 <jalb66> cdesai, in Nokia is impossible I think
10:36:00 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m, oh..
10:37:51 <cdesai> yeah I should've clarified, I meant Xiaomi Android One
10:39:15 <jalb66> cdesai, in Nokia with Android one I can't do it, I wish!
11:11:31 <dazinism> jalb66: Verified boot on the Mi A2 looked great but became disappointing.
11:12:02 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot#Xiaomi
11:15:31 <cn3m[m]> dazinism: oof that's bad

11:28:16 <dazinism> That also doesnt look so good, but its expected that spec exec. will continue to be a cause of serious issues in x86
11:29:27 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "That also doesnt look so good, b"> ARM MacBooks look really appealing right now.
11:29:41 <cn3m[m]> Never thought I'd say that
11:31:58 <jalb66> dazinism, thanks
11:32:23 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "ARM MacBooks look really appeali"> How about Secure Core Surace Pro X?
11:33:10 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "How about Secure Core Surace Pro"> They are different security models
11:33:27 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "They are different security mode"> But it also has an ARM chip
11:34:50 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "But it also has an ARM chip"> I am going to keep an eye on both
11:34:53 <cn3m[m]> Windows isn't as usable on ARM as macOS will be

12:41:09 <stuux[m]> strcat: Should there be an option to make Auditor a device admin in the menu or should the user only enable Auditor as a device admin via the android settings?
12:42:39 <strcat[m]> unsure
12:42:50 <strcat[m]> stuux: also note this stuff has to be kept in sync in AttestationServer
12:43:09 <strcat[m]> so the flags needed to be added there too
12:43:12 <strcat[m]> and that's a bit more work because it stores them
12:43:16 <strcat[m]> so need to add a field to the table
12:43:48 <strcat[m]> src/main/java/app/attestation/server/AttestationServer.java:                attestationConn.exec("ALTER TABLE Devices ADD COLUMN verifiedBootHash BLOB");
12:43:53 <strcat[m]> there are some existing examples
12:43:54 <stuux[m]> is there any way i can test the remote verification with a debug build of Auditor?
12:44:02 <stuux[m]> because currently i test only local
12:44:06 <strcat[m]> stuux: you need to host a copy of the server to do that
12:44:43 <stuux[m]> ok, thanks
12:44:54 <stuux[m]> my prÂ´s work then only localy
12:45:22 <stuux[m]> i will try to implement it on the server, but donÂ´t know if i can host the server
12:45:35 <stuux[m]> should it work with a raspberry pi?
13:20:32 <Mango[m]1> Hi all, sorry but I don't quite understand the "Supported devices" section of the FAQ, what if I do not have a Pixel phone but want to try GrapheneOS ? will it require additional tweaking ? will performance / some features be limited ?
13:24:59 <joshman[m]> How is it so hard to understand
13:25:11 <joshman[m]> Pixel 2,3 only
13:26:16 <joshman[m]> "I want to try security of my deposit box but I only have paper one"
13:27:00 <Mango[m]1> 3a not included ?
13:27:52 <joshman[m]> Included
13:27:53 <Mango[m]1> "Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree."
13:28:03 <Mango[m]1> ok
13:28:21 <Mango[m]1> thx
13:28:56 <joshman[m]> You can build your own version if you know how. Though it won't be Graphene OS
13:29:33 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets
13:29:46 <strcat[m]> > Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree. Device support repositories for the Android Open Source Project can simply be dropped into the source tree, with at most minor modifications within them to support GrapheneOS. In most cases, substantial work beyond that will be needed to bring the support up to
13:29:46 <strcat[m]> the same standards. For most devices, the hardware and firmware will prevent providing a reasonably secure device, regardless of the work put into device support.
13:29:51 <strcat[m]> is the full paragraph in the FAQ
13:41:10 <Mango[m]1> alright, thank you
13:44:13 <jalb66> strcat[m], yesterday something happened with my Pixel 3a, I don't know if it was a bug related to Bluetooth or what, only to tell you if this could happen to more people in the future (I hope not): after driving in my car with the Bluetooth connected (I didn't receive calls) I came home from shopping and when I received a call I noticed that I couldn't hear the caller, only if I enable the speakers. The
13:44:13 <jalb66> n, testing my phone I saw I couldn't hear videos. But the speakers were ok because I could use them with calls and even when changing Tones in "Sound" setting, the microphone was ok because the other person in the call could hear me, and with the earphones all was ok: videos and calls. All settings in Sound were ok, and I didn't change them. In fact, before arriving home after shopping I called my wife
13:44:13 <jalb66> from there and all was ok. The problem began later at home. In the afternoon I touched some things and reboot 2 times the phone hoping to solve the problem. 1 hour later the telephone was ok again...  The other thing I did was cleaning the phone with a wet towel, IDN if this coule make this weird behaviour in a phone. So, IDN what could it be, but only to let you know. Thanks!

14:21:19 <strcat[m]> jalb66: make sure you're up-to-date
14:21:39 <jalb66> strcat[m], yes, I am, with the last update
14:21:48 <jalb66> 02-06-2020
14:21:58 <jalb66> Or in English I think 06-02-2020
14:22:35 <strcat[m]> no that's just a stupid american thing
14:22:44 <jalb66> Ah ok ð
14:22:56 <jalb66> I mean the last update this month
14:23:09 <strcat[m]> yeah sane people don't write dates like that just americans
14:23:13 <jalb66> At first I thought in the wet towel...
14:23:30 <jalb66> Ha ha ok, I didn't know, I'm from Spain
14:23:43 <strcat[m]> and because they ruined 02/06/20, I always make sure to use 2020-06-02 which is the ISO standard way to do dates
14:23:47 <jalb66> But if the hardware was ok..
14:24:15 <jalb66> Ah ok, so 2020-06-02 Just the opposite here :)
14:26:22 <strcat[m]> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
14:27:23 <jalb66> ok
14:29:02 <lucky[m]2> hey im putting graphene on my phone and when i try to run flash all in my file folder, my command prompt will just close
14:29:14 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (35KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/icNOjgrCCspONxroLEpTAmaM >
14:29:30 <lucky[m]2> can i get a hand running through this? Also, my phone is unlocked and ready to install
14:30:30 <jalb66> lucky[m]2, follow the instructions from the website step by step
14:31:07 <lucky[m]2> im following this video, and he is reading the instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
14:31:14 <lucky[m]2> @ 8:00
14:32:08 <jalb66> REad the website too, always
14:32:16 <jalb66> Videos could be outdated
14:32:27 <jalb66> Did you use sudo?
14:32:38 <jalb66> If you're using a GNU/Linux
14:32:45 <jalb66> If you're using GNU/Linux
14:32:59 <lucky[m]2> i have the option to use linux
14:33:46 <jalb66> In the website you'll find some things like https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting and other things
14:34:02 <jalb66> Maybe the video could be missing some things
14:34:12 <jalb66> Did you update your Pixel?
14:34:29 <jalb66> Are you using the right cable?
14:34:29 <jalb66> etc
14:35:15 <jalb66> What's your device?
14:35:54 <lucky[m]2> win 10, or ParrotOS (Debian)
14:36:03 <lucky[m]2> yes to all of it
14:36:11 <lucky[m]2> i did everything the way I should have
14:36:18 <lucky[m]2> its just the file not opening up
14:37:26 * lucky[m]2 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/FKPjkdtFDBVqvvpZHTELCUKu >
14:38:00 <jalb66> Sorry, maybe another person could help you more, I don't use Windows and IDN if ParrotOS could give you some problems or not: Prerequisites
14:38:00 <jalb66> You should have at least 2GB of free memory available.
14:38:00 <jalb66> Windows 10, macOS Catalina, Arch Linux, Debian buster and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS are the officially supported operating systems for installing GrapheneOS
14:39:36 <lucky[m]2> yup i meet the prereqs
14:40:11 <jalb66> Try with Linux
14:40:41 <jalb66> Or maybe someone using Windows here could help you
14:40:56 <jalb66> I installed GOS recently from Debian, new user
14:41:08 <jalb66> And I had no problems at all
14:41:30 <jalb66> Please read in the website: On Windows:
14:41:31 <jalb66> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
14:42:08 <jalb66> You used the Linux command
14:42:12 <jalb66> Not Windows
14:42:36 <jalb66> And did you manage to unzip the file?
14:42:44 <jalb66> 7zip for example works ok
14:44:29 <jalb66> https://www.7-zip.org/
14:44:54 <jalb66> Maybe you haven't tar in your Windows, IDN

14:57:26 <lucky[m]2> i dont get it
15:00:42 <jalb66> Maybe it's easier if you use GNU/Linux
15:01:24 <lucky[m]2> im having troubles on Parrot too
15:01:25 <jalb66> It seems your tar doesn't work
15:04:14 <jalb66> I don't know about .hash
15:04:37 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger could help you more
15:11:57 <EssentialChaos[m> Is tar even supposed to work with .zip files?
15:12:35 <v2flel[m]> (unrelated) I found a button in the settings app that doesn't do anything: network&Internet > mobile network> "settings version"
15:12:36 <v2flel[m]> Is that a known issue?
15:13:06 <EssentialChaos[m> Lucky: Also what are you using: cmd or PowerShell?
15:13:40 <lucky[m]2> cmd
15:13:47 <EssentialChaos[m> Try with PowerShell
15:15:14 <EssentialChaos[m> Also, I think, tar is not supposed to work with .zip archives
15:16:18 <EssentialChaos[m> You can either try `unzip` or do it from the GUI
15:16:40 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Also, I think, `tar` is not supposed to work with .zip archives
15:17:28 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m, in the website with Windows it says tar...
15:17:53 <jalb66> Maybe powershell?
15:18:19 <EssentialChaos[m> <jalb66 "Maybe powershell?"> Probably
15:18:58 <EssentialChaos[m> I need to pay more attention to what I read...
15:22:24 <jalb66> Anyway zip or 7zip is valid to unzip
15:22:45 <jalb66> But if that't in the instructions, then it should work
15:22:51 <jalb66> But if that's in the instructions, then it should work
15:31:09 <lucky[m]2> im doing it on linux now
15:31:11 <lucky[m]2> parrot is just a debian flavour
15:35:18 <jalb66> lucky[m]2, be sure to download the new platform-tools version
15:37:27 <jalb66>  Or at least 28.0.2
16:00:30 <lucky[m]2> okok
16:00:32 <lucky[m]2> i think im getting somewhere
16:00:57 <lucky[m]2> i have something that says `PRoduct Revision: blueline MP1.0(ROW)
16:01:04 <lucky[m]2>  * i have something that says `PRoduct Revision: blueline MP1.0(ROW)`
16:14:56 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: the install guide is correct
16:15:03 <strcat[m]> bsdtar supports many formats including RAR and ZIP
16:15:11 <strcat[m]> Windows 10 and macOS have bsdtar as tar
16:15:25 <strcat[m]> tar xvf is the correct way to unzip from the CLI on Windows
16:15:39 <strcat[m]> I don't know another way to do it with the built-in tools, and there is no need to install anything else
16:16:33 <strcat[m]> the install guide says Windows 10 is supported, not earlier versions
16:16:39 <strcat[m]> also it says to use powershell
16:16:56 <strcat[m]> Get-FileHash is a powershell command
16:17:10 <strcat[m]> the install guide works perfectly on Windows, exactly the commands it uses
16:17:53 <strcat[m]> if people have a modified PATH with a bunch of broken tools added or w/e it's not something the guide can dealt with
16:19:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools Linux distributions are the odd one out here because they mostly use crappy GNU tar
16:19:46 <strcat[m]> http://infozip.sourceforge.net/ that's the unzip / zip command in linux distributions
16:19:54 <strcat[m]> last release in 2009, bunch of known security vulnerabilities in it, distributions have varying patches for those
16:20:21 <jalb66> strcat[m], maybe you could add to the guide that using Windows requiere using Powershell commands
16:20:30 <strcat[m]> it says that
16:20:39 <strcat[m]> > These instructions use command-line tools. On Windows, use PowerShell rather than the legacy Command Prompt.
16:20:48 <jalb66> Ahh ok
16:20:56 <strcat[m]> and brings it up again about curl
16:20:57 <strcat[m]> > You can either download the files with your browser or using a command like curl. It's generally easier to use the command-line since you're already using it for the rest of the installation process, so these instructions use curl. On Windows, you need to reference curl as curl.exe since PowerShell has a legacy curl alias.
16:21:32 <strcat[m]> there is a limit to what I can do to clarify everything
16:21:58 <jalb66> All the guide is complete then ð I imagine you checking it many times lol
16:22:07 <strcat[m]> it's easier for most people on Windows and macOS than Linux distributions because they don't have to deal with not having access to the device
16:22:28 <strcat[m]> and their OS doesn't provide them with a bunch of outdated, broken and heavily screwed up patched software packages
16:22:56 <strcat[m]> there is none of that issue where people can't access it without root unless they set up custom udev rules
16:23:05 <EssentialChaos[m> > last release in 2009, bunch of known security vulnerabilities in it, distributions have varying patches for those
16:23:05 <EssentialChaos[m> Why is everything so messed up?
16:23:15 <strcat[m]> since they let local users access local usb devices
16:23:26 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: I kinda want to change the linux instructions to use bsdtar...
16:23:37 <strcat[m]> I wish it was just tar across all of them
16:23:58 * EssentialChaos[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ErWYrYhyxpedxnFffIaHJOTv >
16:24:04 <strcat[m]> https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/unzip
16:24:06 <strcat[m]> in arch linux for example
16:24:18 <strcat[m]> look at all the security patches
16:24:27 <strcat[m]> and arch linux as a rule does not apply any unnecessary patches, it's against the distro guidelines
16:24:40 <strcat[m]> that's not necessarily all the patches for public issues - just the ones that distros are aware of
16:24:54 <strcat[m]> you know, it's generally a good thing to have an upstream for software that develops it
16:24:55 <strcat[m]> and does releases
16:25:10 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: there are much more core things without maintainers
16:25:11 <strcat[m]> that are widely used
16:25:16 <strcat[m]> for a long time 'shadow' was unmaintained
16:25:27 <strcat[m]> it probably still effectively is
16:25:37 <cdesai> I'm tempted to just include fastboot in the zip.
16:25:38 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "you know, it's generally a good "> Which is why I am wondering, how does it not have developers
16:25:42 <strcat[m]> i.e. tools like useradd, passwd
16:25:58 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: well on *BSD there is a group of people that develop the OS as a project
16:26:13 <EssentialChaos[m> Couldn't GNU/FSF spare some developers?
16:26:17 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: on Linux, traditional distros assemble the OS out of hundreds of packages with fragmented / non-existent upstreams
16:26:20 <strcat[m]> often they are anti-security
16:26:34 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: lol you know stuff like gpg and gnutls all has basically 1 anti-security maintainer
16:26:46 <strcat[m]> 1 each
16:27:04 <strcat[m]> it's all super fragmented
16:27:42 <strcat[m]> so for example the librsvg developer unilaterally decided to rewrite it in rust (not aware of anything else like that) and pretty much everyone else is super pissed about it cause they're very much in the mindset of C or else
16:29:06 <strcat[m]> *BSDs have a much different development approach
16:29:16 <strcat[m]> the base OS has a dedicated group of maintainers/developers responsible for it
16:29:17 <EssentialChaos[m> I was entertaining a thought of rewriting core utils in Rust...
16:29:25 <strcat[m]> third party software is in a separate ports thing
16:29:34 <strcat[m]> they don't assemble an OS out of third party packages via ports
16:29:42 <jalb66> Installing bsdtar ð
16:30:05 <strcat[m]> so, they still have the same non-existent security model for applications, etc. but at least they have a real OS development model where it's not a total clusterfuck
16:30:07 <EssentialChaos[m> I know nothing about core utils, but it would probably be a fun project
16:30:07 <strcat[m]> of projects that hate each other
16:30:33 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: btw a lot of the projects also implement alternate versions of the same CLI tools
16:30:35 <strcat[m]> there is substantial overlap
16:30:45 <strcat[m]> in some cases there are 3 versions of the tool from different packages included in most linux distros
16:30:51 <strcat[m]> and they have to each choose which to use
16:31:08 <strcat[m]> and there are fights about this nonstop
16:31:22 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=597050
16:31:33 <strcat[m]> there are examples with the core tools though
16:31:58 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: anyway there is not some standard set of stuff or a base OS developed by the same group of people in the traditional linux world
16:32:22 <strcat[m]> it's just a bunch of projects with different ways of doing things, different attitudes on stuff like security, glued together by the distros
16:32:44 <strcat[m]> many of the developers of these projects are anti-security
16:33:04 <strcat[m]> and they have a real thing for traditions and the good old days
16:33:10 <jalb66> Do they prefer usability before security?
16:33:20 <strcat[m]> they prefer doing things like they did in 1970
16:33:36 <strcat[m]> and not having people bother them about their project being exploitable when they don't consider that a problem
16:33:44 <jalb66> I know Linus Torvalds always recognized that
16:33:47 <EssentialChaos[m> Probably prefer speed
16:34:46 <jalb66> Considering that internet works mostly in Linux... where are we?
16:35:24 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/hanno/status/1270344418810384385
16:35:35 <strcat[m]> a nice recent one
16:35:56 <strcat[m]> but it's not news that GPG is insecure legacy garbage so w/e
16:36:18 <strcat[m]> like how someone points out as a reply that it may have to do with the sign-then-encrypt mess of PGP
16:36:30 <jalb66> Do you think Openbsd is better than GNU/LInux un security then?, I know about the problems in OpenBSD
16:36:46 <jalb66> I read that you collaborated with them sometime
16:37:16 <EssentialChaos[m> > Do you think Openbsd is better than GNU/LInux un security then?, I know about the problems in OpenBSD
16:37:16 <EssentialChaos[m> Another interesting question is the same but about the kernels
16:37:19 <jalb66> And can GNU/LInux be fixed...?
16:37:34 <strcat[m]> ghostscript and libtiff are nice examples of totally fucked up things that should never be touched ever
16:37:51 <strcat[m]> jalb66: you start fixing it by removing all the GNU stuff which is not hard
16:38:34 <jalb66> Is it GNU the real problem or the kernel too?, I know that many bugs are added to the kernel
16:38:42 <strcat[m]> there are many problems
16:38:44 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m, yes
16:38:55 <EssentialChaos[m> > jalb66: you start fixing it by removing all the GNU stuff which is not hard
16:38:55 <EssentialChaos[m> Maybe not hard, but would probably require a lot of work since most guides are for GNU/Linux. Also would it break compatibility?
16:39:07 <strcat[m]> GNU software is pretty much just universally garbage from anti-security people though
16:39:41 <jalb66> strcat[m], and then they talk about privacy a lot.... WIthout security
16:39:43 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: makes no difference to usage if the system uses musl or glibc
16:40:01 <strcat[m]> jalb66: traditional linux systems don't have any meaningful application security model
16:40:26 <strcat[m]> and they are missing many basic privacy features
16:40:47 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure how you get privacy without security when most of it is part of security
16:40:54 <strcat[m]> only a few bits and pieces can be treated as separate
16:40:58 <strcat[m]> odds and ends, not the core stuff
16:41:19 <jalb66> strcat[m], I know, but for example I never had a problem with GNU/Linux in many years, or with OpenBSD. But with Windows and Mac a lot of problems and many of them about privacy, updates, etc
16:41:23 <strcat[m]> and software being open source certainly doesn't make it secure or mean that it avoids privacy-invasive approaches
16:41:37 <strcat[m]> I don't know what 'never had a problem' has to do with this
16:41:41 <strcat[m]> or what you mean by that
16:42:07 <strcat[m]> it's also really not interesting hearing regurgitated misinformation here
16:42:30 <cx2[m]> <strcat[m] "it's also really not interesting"> Preach
16:42:49 <jalb66> I mean that maybe many people like me prefer trusting in privacy even without security, yes: a bad thing... But if I prefer security then I can't trust in all what happened all these years with Windows or Mac and losing privacy. So, what's the solution?
16:43:00 <strcat[m]> this is not a good place to try to get people to migrate away from macOS to Linux when they get far more privacy and security on macOS, and so on
16:43:20 <strcat[m]> it's just not the place to do that
16:43:22 <jalb66> Not my intention strcat[m]
16:43:30 <jalb66> I used them all
16:43:46 <jalb66> Also Windows 10
16:43:48 <strcat[m]> doesn't make you an expert on it
16:43:53 <jalb66> No, I'm not
16:44:30 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: hanno does lots of fuzzing for open source applications and libraries
16:44:34 <strcat[m]> and he reports the bugs
16:44:41 <jalb66> It's not what I'm telling, my question is: what is the best system in security + privacy to trust?
16:44:45 <strcat[m]> he posts a lot about how the maintainers basically tell him to fuck off and they don't care about security bugs
16:44:58 <EssentialChaos[m> strcat: Btw, have you read about Genode? If so, what are your thoughts?
16:46:32 <jalb66> It's a pity my Macbook was  broken and I wasn't using iCloud
16:46:56 <jalb66> Maybe Mac is the way to go..
16:47:06 <jalb66> Even being closed source?
16:47:55 <jalb66> I'd like to knos from an expert like you what you recommend
16:48:02 <jalb66> I'd like to know from an expert like you what you recommend
16:48:31 <strcat[m]> EssentialChaos: no and not ready to switch topics
16:48:40 <strcat[m]> exiv2 is a nice example of what I am talking about
16:48:49 <strcat[m]> it's an image metadata parsing library
16:48:54 <strcat[m]> heavily used by GNOME, KDE and lots of other things
16:49:29 <strcat[m]> https://dev.exiv2.org/issues/0001248
16:50:09 <strcat[m]> lead developer explains he has never considered security, it wasn't written to be secure
16:50:10 <strcat[m]> and he doesn't care
16:50:20 <strcat[m]> and doesn't want to even fix the bugs, let alone engineering it to be secure
16:50:33 <strcat[m]> > I'm very unwilling to stick lots of code into Exiv2 to deal with illegal files. It will be a very considerable undertaking which might have unbounded scope. I'll build it with clang 3.9 and see what happens. If it throws an exception, I don't want to dig deeper.
16:50:57 <jalb66> :-o
16:51:03 <strcat[m]> > Returning to Hanno's request that we say that Exiv2 is "not suitable for untrusted input". I will not do that. The default (for all open source software) is that the user must determine suitability for his/her purposes. We do not claim that Exiv2 is safe for all files. I doubt if we could ever make such a claim even if we pepper our code with checks for malicious images. I don't believe in 2016 that it is possible to
16:51:03 <strcat[m]> guarantee the safety and reliability of any software.
16:51:22 <strcat[m]> so he won't even try to make it at all safe
16:51:35 <strcat[m]> he chooses to write it all in C
16:51:46 <strcat[m]> but has no interest in doing those annoying integer overflow checks, bounds checks, etc.
16:51:52 <strcat[m]> doesn't want to clutter his code with that stuff
16:52:00 <strcat[m]> this is a core library used by GNOME, KDE and many things
16:52:11 <strcat[m]> https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/exiv2/
16:52:43 <strcat[m]> this is a common attitude among many of the people maintaining / developing all these assorted projects
16:53:06 <strcat[m]> most won't say it so explicitly in one go, but they do reveal how they feel about these things over time
16:53:17 <strcat[m]> this applies to a lot of linux kernel maintainers too
16:53:35 <strcat[m]> and yeah, the 'many eyes' finding bugs == hanno occasionally coming along to fuzz something (not auditing it)
16:53:37 <strcat[m]> or something else like that
16:53:41 <strcat[m]> there are not actually people reviewing stuff
16:53:47 <strcat[m]> and look what happens when they report vulnerabilities
16:54:07 <strcat[m]> pretty much 30% of software has maintainers like this that are anti-security
16:54:24 <strcat[m]> and a majority of software doesn't have maintainers that will be open about vulnerabilities / security limitations, etc.
16:54:48 <strcat[m]> so yeah it being open source makes it easier for someone like hanno to come along and try to help and be ignored or told to go away
16:54:59 <strcat[m]> not sure how that makes it more secure
16:55:10 <strcat[m]> most open source software is never going to have someone look at it in regards to security at all
16:55:16 <strcat[m]> and if they do it's not going to be most of the code
16:55:56 <strcat[m]> > I know nothing about hacking and exploiting buffer overflows. Perhaps we need more caution about them. This is a mind-boggling issue. The code to defend our image read/write code could be larger than the current library. It appears that Apple have generated code which catches the crash. We need more research on how to handle this within a library. And preferably a method that doesn't require us to add thousands of if
16:55:56 <strcat[m]> statements.
16:56:08 <strcat[m]> this is not the kind of thing you want to hear from someone who maintains a core library for your OS
16:56:10 <strcat[m]> really
16:56:48 <strcat[m]> there are posts like this from core linux kernel maintainers too, it's just harder to search lkml, it's easier for me to search and find stuff like this I remember
16:56:55 <strcat[m]> I have a whole bunch of things like this I remember that I could find / link to
16:56:56 <strcat[m]> this is one of MANY examples
16:57:03 <jalb66> OMG
16:58:12 <strcat[m]> so, in my opinion that is based on knowing a lot about the dirty details of how the sausage is made
16:58:13 <strcat[m]> and knowing a lot about these issues
16:58:31 <strcat[m]> it's incredibly important to have an OS developed as an organized project with an actual development team
16:58:41 <strcat[m]> not assembled out of tons of fragmented projects with conflicts between each other, anti-security attitudes and so on
16:59:01 <strcat[m]> you cannot do systemic privacy or security work without that
16:59:02 <strcat[m]> and you can't have a proper culture that CARES about either
16:59:31 <strcat[m]> what do you get when you assemble an OS out of utter shit like GPG, gnutls, exiv2, systemd and all this other crap
16:59:36 <jalb66> So, what's the best Desktop OS to use then?
17:00:02 <strcat[m]> stuff like unzip with the last release from 2009 is normal
17:00:12 <strcat[m]> look at polkit
17:00:13 <fluoridatedsheep> <strcat[m] "what do you get when you assembl"> whats wrong with gpg?
17:00:23 <strcat[m]> polkit is a core part of the desktop 'security' model
17:00:36 <strcat[m]> and is basically abandoned, horribly designed crap that decided to write the security policies in javascript
17:00:43 <strcat[m]> using an out-of-date fork of firefox's JS engine
17:00:52 <strcat[m]> without security updates
17:01:07 <EssentialChaos[m> But how do we get rid of GNU on Linux if Linux fights Clang?
17:01:23 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: PGP itself is a horrible standard with really bad cryptography and a really insecure / terrible design
17:01:43 <strcat[m]> bad crypto, massively overly complex / over-engineered design, terrible usability making it incredibly hard to use correctly / safely
17:02:01 <strcat[m]> GPG is an extremely poor implementation with a lot of other problems
17:02:07 <strcat[m]> and especially when you try to use GPG to secure emails
17:02:12 <strcat[m]> that makes it 10x worse
17:02:24 <strcat[m]> since email is utter shit and complicated as hell
17:02:34 <strcat[m]> and the integration is insecure/broken
17:02:34 <fluoridatedsheep> <strcat[m] "bad crypto, massively overly com"> Can I dm you over this. curiousity peaked. just got into cryptography a bit deeper
17:03:07 <strcat[m]> sign-then-encrypt, sha1, no forward secrecy, long-lived keys, very poorly designed trust model that's barely usable, tons of other problems
17:03:11 <strcat[m]> lots written about it
17:03:23 <strcat[m]> there is a very strong consensus among cryptographers and security researchers that GPG is utter shit
17:03:34 <strcat[m]> no shortage of posts written about it by people who know a lot more about it than me
17:04:06 <strcat[m]> even just using it for signing / verification involves a huge amount of unnecessarily complexity, attack surface, usability issues
17:04:09 <strcat[m]> bad crypto
17:04:20 <strcat[m]> I have phased it out and hardly use it anymore
17:04:43 <strcat[m]> almost fully purged from GrapheneOS other than upstreams using it to sign stuff
17:04:53 <strcat[m]> it's not used by GrapheneOS itself ofc
17:05:00 <strcat[m]> I mean phased out of the development process
17:05:01 <fluoridatedsheep> I'd agree that it is far from usable. Try to introduce someone new to it and it could take a solid hour. I usually use as an overlay over e2ee platforms like this. No built in encryption here so i like it, controlling the keys. i always make 4096 length
17:05:20 <strcat[m]> we aren't crazy we'd never ship production software using gpg
17:05:34 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: GPG is *horrible* for encrypted messaging, using it for that is one of the worst things to do with it
17:05:45 <strcat[m]> use a proper encrypted messaging system with modern crypto, forward secrecy, proper error handling / sanity checks
17:05:51 <strcat[m]> don't use GPG, it's known to be insecure and broken
17:06:12 <fluoridatedsheep> I never really messed with signing. Thought it was a pain in the ass. and do you think the encryption is actually broken. And fair point about PFS, but you can burn keys at any moment
17:06:15 <strcat[m]> and I just linked a tweet above showing yet another just discovered issue where they just don't care and won't fix it
17:06:39 <cdesai> are there any other options to sign git tags?
17:06:48 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: the point of perfect forward secrecy is that if a key is compromised it doesn't compromise any of your past conversations
17:07:11 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yes but not via git's own porcelain
17:07:40 <strcat[m]> btw git names their code porcelain and plumbing because they know it's shit
17:07:57 <strcat[m]> talking about bad software that's poorly thrown together
17:07:58 <strcat[m]> lol.
17:08:04 <fluoridatedsheep> <strcat[m] "fluoridated sheeple: the point o"> Right, but once you burn the key on your end, they ideally couldnt break it and future convos proceed with a new key correct? obviously this is all manual and far from convenient
17:08:29 <fluoridatedsheep> <strcat[m] "talking about bad software that'"> lmap
17:08:31 <fluoridatedsheep> lmao*
17:08:46 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: not the same topic
17:10:51 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html
17:11:06 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/
17:13:32 <strcat[m]> fluoridated sheeple: there are probably basic things you assume about it that are not true
17:13:34 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/agl__/status/410574212961533952
17:13:36 <strcat[m]> and ofc those are sha1 based
17:18:05 <strcat[m]> also watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrBVXxZDVQY about the Linux kernel but that's the tip of the iceberg
17:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> what kind of depresses me about gpg is that the mode of functioning in thr cipher is CFB rather than GCM and even these days 3DES and SHA1 still need to be enabled by default.
17:20:10 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: sign-and-encrypt, sha1 not just enabled but used, etc.
17:20:12 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it's also just horribly complex and broken with lack of tons of sanity / error checks
17:20:30 <strcat[m]> fixing gpg == throwing it out and using sane software
17:20:50 <TheJollyRoger> right now my book is at a standstill for there being not enough hours in the day to continue work on it but also because there is no way for me to advise the users on how to work around these problems.
17:20:57 <strcat[m]> software that insecure and unusable has no use case
17:21:05 <strcat[m]> people are better off not trying
17:21:12 * TheJollyRoger drowns his sorrows.
17:22:03 <TheJollyRoger> since these problems are also a part of the RFC. Our hands are tied.
17:23:07 <TheJollyRoger> which sudc
17:23:22 <TheJollyRoger> cks.
17:23:34 <strcat[m]> I think we'll have to give up on making GrapheneOS traffic look like a normal phone
17:23:42 <TheJollyRoger> whoa
17:23:44 <strcat[m]> because I want to change things we can't otherwise change
17:24:03 <strcat[m]> unsure but there are some really fucked up things
17:24:09 <strcat[m]> in the linux kernel TCP/IP stack
17:24:38 <strcat[m]> and if we fix stuff like that it makes it detectable as not the norm
17:24:46 <strcat[m]> so what to do in that conundrum
17:25:36 * TheJollyRoger scratches his head.
17:27:13 <EssentialChaos[m> Say: "Look and be jealous"? /s
17:27:27 <EssentialChaos[m> Maybe you could get it upstream at some point
17:27:59 <EssentialChaos[m> So it wouldn't look that different
17:28:08 <EssentialChaos[m> > Maybe you could get it upstream at some point
17:28:08 <EssentialChaos[m> Upstream to Android, I mean
17:30:09 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "so what to do in that conundrum"> Make it optional?
17:30:58 <madaidan[m]> Like an option in the settings to value anonymity over security or vice versa.
17:32:16 <strcat[m]> next release will disable stable IPv6 privacy addresses
17:32:19 <strcat[m]> for one thing
17:32:36 <strcat[m]> and go back to using MAC-based ones (which are based on the random MAC in practice)
17:32:41 <strcat[m]> only relevant to link-local addresses
17:32:51 <strcat[m]> stable IPv6 privacy addresses are fucked
17:32:55 <strcat[m]> they're based on the subnet
17:33:04 <strcat[m]> it's hard to explain they're just fucked
17:33:07 <strcat[m]> the whole standard is dumb
17:33:14 <strcat[m]> I don't understand why it exists
17:34:08 <strcat[m]> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7217
17:34:25 * TheJollyRoger buries his head in his hands.
17:34:51 <TheJollyRoger> Don't get me wrong, strcat, I believe you, I believe you. I just don't know what to say.
17:35:41 <strcat[m]> it's fucked
17:36:14 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7217
17:36:15 <strcat[m]> look at
17:36:16 <strcat[m]> page 7
17:36:36 <strcat[m]> I don't know how to link to it
17:37:26 <madaidan[m]> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7217#page-7
17:37:34 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I think part of the problem is the Linux kernel has a really minimal implementation
17:37:38 <strcat[m]> not doing everything suggested
17:37:56 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: oh thereis an invisible anchor thing
17:37:56 <strcat[m]> weird
17:37:59 * TheJollyRoger reads.
17:38:19 <strcat[m]> why do they make the anchor invisible and just put it above the RFC name on each page
17:38:20 <strcat[m]> ???
17:38:48 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: so the issue is what happens if a network just pretends to be the same (and afaict SSID is irrelevant)
17:38:51 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah they should just make the page clickable...
17:38:53 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah?
17:39:14 <strcat[m]> and, rather than pretends
17:39:16 <strcat[m]> what if due to incompetence
17:39:17 <strcat[m]> they all appear the same
17:39:17 <strcat[m]> except for SSID which is unused by the linux kernel
17:39:29 <strcat[m]> so you have this long term secret key
17:39:44 <strcat[m]> and it ends up generating same IP across networks
17:39:44 <strcat[m]> also we don't WANT this shit
17:39:45 <strcat[m]> why does this exist
17:39:51 <strcat[m]> why not just ALWAYS use a private public address (which is thankfully already the case)
17:40:11 <strcat[m]> and base the link local address on MAC address since MAC address is known there anyway
17:40:12 <strcat[m]> so if MAC addr is random, it is random
17:40:18 <strcat[m]> oh wait that's ALREADY HOW THIS WORKS BEFORE THIS STUPID SHIT
17:40:25 <strcat[m]> anyways
17:40:30 <TheJollyRoger> Woah wait wait wait did I just hear this right? The client will reuse the same key to an unauthenticated network?
17:40:31 <strcat[m]> fixed this problem
17:40:35 <strcat[m]> we just pretend it is not supported now
17:40:49 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: no but rather
17:40:52 <strcat[m]> the way this is supposed to work
17:41:05 <strcat[m]> is you generate a long term secret key and reuse that forever
17:41:05 <TheJollyRoger> Isn't that the same as leaking the session key RIGHT TO ANYONE THAT ASKS FOR IT POLITELY?!
17:41:06 <strcat[m]> that part is not really a problem
17:41:11 <strcat[m]> this key is used to generate IPv6 addresses
17:41:19 <strcat[m]> keyed hash
17:41:24 <strcat[m]> PRF (keyed hash basically)
17:41:36 <strcat[m]> PRF(secret key, details of network) -> ip address
17:41:41 <strcat[m]> the idea is that you get a unique IP across networks
17:41:45 <strcat[m]> but it's the same IP each time
17:41:53 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: now, the issue
17:42:03 <strcat[m]> is the inputs about the details of the network
17:42:07 <strcat[m]> it is not really unique
17:42:24 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: regardless we wouldn't want this even if it worked
17:42:28 <strcat[m]> because we pick a new random MAC each time by default
17:42:39 <strcat[m]> also it just makes SO MUCH MORE SENSE to base the link local address on MAC addr
17:42:43 <strcat[m]> so if MAC is random, it is random
17:42:49 <strcat[m]> if MAC is per-network random, it is per-network random
17:42:59 <strcat[m]> if MAC is device MAC, it is based on device MAC
17:43:00 <strcat[m]> isn't that the best approach?
17:43:04 <strcat[m]> why does this shit exist.
17:43:44 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I think the linux kernel impl is totally screwed up which is the main issue
17:43:46 <strcat[m]> anyways w/e
17:44:13 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "TheJollyRoger: I think the linux"> That's the general rule
17:44:36 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: someone reported a bug related to this which may not occur for everyone and which I've resolved now
17:44:37 <TheJollyRoger> Good gravy >_<.
17:44:58 <TheJollyRoger> Whew. Thank you so much for fixing it.
17:45:26 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez... upstream really needs to get their rear in gear... it shouldn't be Downstream's responsibility to pick up after Upstream's problems.
17:45:29 <strcat[m]> fixing == not using this dumb kernel feature
17:45:41 <strcat[m]> my fix is pretending it is linux < 4.4
17:46:08 <TheJollyRoger> Well... I... I guess that that'll pass for an older handset, r-right...?
17:47:00 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_system_netd/commit/ac0d8fcd1e99c0dbe1195e2026158d0f730582d5
17:47:15 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I tested for a long time trying to figure out what android was doing wrong
17:47:23 <strcat[m]> android doesn't do anything wrong
17:47:54 <strcat[m]> feature sucks
17:48:01 <TheJollyRoger> So this is the message it will get back...? "Not supported by GrapheneOS?"
17:48:07 <strcat[m]> after next release I'll document the change
17:48:21 <strcat[m]> but this makes GrapheneOS different than AOSP in a way that might be detectable
17:48:32 <strcat[m]> also I found more problems
17:48:37 <strcat[m]> strictly in the linux kernel
17:48:41 <strcat[m]> can't fix in userspace with config
17:48:54 <TheJollyRoger> Good golly.
17:48:59 <strcat[m]> anyway g2g to sleep this stuff stressed me out
17:49:03 <strcat[m]> worked on it all night
17:49:21 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the linux kernel leaks stuff
17:49:29 <strcat[m]> in packets
17:49:32 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez.
17:49:33 <strcat[m]> anyway g2g for now
17:49:37 <TheJollyRoger> Holy yipes, rest up man.
17:49:43 <TheJollyRoger> See you in the morning.
17:49:52 <TheJollyRoger> Sleep well, and thank you.
17:51:08 <jalb66> Sleep well ð
17:52:33 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: they put uninit data on the wire
17:52:45 <strcat[m]> and they use some really questionable stuff as initial values/seeds
17:52:46 <strcat[m]> weird stuff
17:53:02 <TheJollyRoger> T_T Aargh.
17:53:14 <TheJollyRoger> Go rest, man.
17:54:14 <strcat[m]> ipv6 stable priv address is the stupidest thing ever
17:54:14 <strcat[m]> tho
17:54:40 <strcat[m]> at least they only used it for link local
18:05:54 <TheJollyRoger> Eesh.
18:14:01 <jalb66> Well, so I don't know what he thinks about what is the best system in security + privacy to trust, maybe none.
18:15:04 <jalb66> Maybe the answer is that we're all fucked. Negative thoughts.
18:17:04 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: Right now, I think the best bet we have is probably Android, and what GrapheneOS wants to do in the long run is to try to work toward replacement of the Linux Kernel, when the project is in better health. For the time being, the focus is on improving the security of what we've got provisionally.
18:17:19 <TheJollyRoger> The way I see it is this:
18:17:31 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, yes, I only trust in GOS right now
18:17:38 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
18:17:39 <jalb66> I mean Desktop OS
18:18:05 <TheJollyRoger> At this moment... I'm really unsure. The problem with desktop operating systems tends to be that they assume you're only running trusted code.
18:18:12 <TheJollyRoger> Or rather, trustworthy code.
18:18:12 <EssentialChaos[m> jalb66: iPadOS?
18:18:46 <joshman[m]> MacBook 2021
18:19:28 <jalb66> MY problem is that I can't trust in closed source, because you don't know what you're using, yes... I know that many people don't check the code but at least you can, or they can. And in the other hand GNU/Linux is full of bugs and problems with 0 security, and also BSD,s, so?
18:19:42 <jalb66> I had a Mac and Windows before and well...
18:19:57 <jalb66> So, I'm lost here now
18:20:10 <jalb66> Maybe I must use whatever Desktop OS and not worry
18:20:31 <TheJollyRoger> Here's what I feel is the thing about the BSDs - they make the same fundamental assumption with respect to the applications.
18:20:38 <TheJollyRoger> They assume you're running only code that is trustworthy.
18:20:44 <joshman[m]> I'm saying Arm MacBook 2021 is the best bet in the near future
18:20:56 <EssentialChaos[m> Hmm, one could make a special Gentoo profile ;)
18:21:00 <EssentialChaos[m> Without GNU
18:21:14 <TheJollyRoger> Heh. Well, I've tried....
18:21:14 <EssentialChaos[m> Based on Hardened Gentoo
18:21:17 <EssentialChaos[m> But take it up to eleven
18:21:20 <joshman[m]> Gentoo still has Kernel
18:21:37 <TheJollyRoger> You won't get a usable desktop out of it at the end of the day.
18:22:09 <EssentialChaos[m> <joshman[m] "Gentoo still has Kernel"> Linux is less to deal with than GNU/Linux
18:22:10 <TheJollyRoger> You're still going to need gcc.
18:22:22 <jalb66> Do you remember Beos and qnx?, what about them?
18:22:38 <jalb66> I don't know a lot, I used them a long time ago (I'm more than 50 y.o.)
18:22:57 <jalb66> BUt only to test them
18:22:57 <jalb66> But I'm not an expert or whatever
18:23:07 <jalb66> I don't know if they are better or not
18:23:45 <joshman[m]> Daily discussion. Don't trust Apple, don't trust Microsoft, please tell me what distro to run I know they all are shit but I just want you to sweet talk me ð
18:24:01 <cdesai> jalb66: Haiku exists, a BeOS compatible oss OS
18:24:06 <jalb66> joshman[m], why Mac 2001?
18:24:15 <jalb66> cdesai, thanks
18:24:19 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, thanks
18:24:39 <jalb66> Haiku I couldn't boot with it...
18:24:41 <joshman[m]> jalb66 I said 2021
18:24:50 <jalb66> Ah 2021 lol, sorry
18:24:50 <EssentialChaos[m> <jalb66 "josh.man, why Mac 2001?"> 2021*
18:25:26 <EssentialChaos[m> Because it'll have an ARM chip, I guess
18:26:00 <joshman[m]> Yes. Beginning of the end of x86 era. Finally
18:26:09 <jalb66> Ok, thanks
18:26:52 <jalb66> Don't kill me: at the end of my Macbook Pro, I deleted MacOS and installed GNU/Linux...
18:27:00 <EssentialChaos[m> <EssentialChaos[m "Hmm, one *could* make a special "> Or maybe one could fork ChromiumOS
18:27:15 <jalb66> What a stupid decission then!
18:27:26 <generateduser392> <jalb66 "Don't kill me: at the end of my "> thinking of doing that, hard to do?
18:27:33 <EssentialChaos[m> <jalb66 "Don't kill me: at the end of my "> Is that why it was the end?
18:28:04 <joshman[m]> Once Apple launches ARM every other company will blindly follow as it always was. Memory card reader, Headphone jack, usbc
18:28:05 <jalb66> Well, in that laptop it was hard... but IDN now, I think now it's easier, I don't know about Mac in these past 5 years or so
18:28:32 <jalb66> But I know that it was easy for some people before
18:28:35 <generateduser392> got macbook from 5-6 years ago
18:28:41 <jalb66> But only Ubuntu ð
18:28:45 <EssentialChaos[m> <joshman[m] "Once Apple launches ARM every ot"> When will Apple follow Apple on USB-C?
18:28:46 <generateduser392> back when it was the best in the market
18:29:00 <jalb66> generateduser392, but... why are you going to do that?
18:29:06 <jalb66> Keep Macos
18:29:07 <jalb66> lol
18:29:23 <generateduser392> nearing end of update life
18:29:34 <generateduser392> 2 more os updates max
18:30:14 <joshman[m]> Linux is no better than outdated macos
18:30:17 <jalb66> Ah ok
18:30:31 <generateduser392> <joshman[m] "Linux is no better than outdated"> why?
18:30:39 <jalb66> I missed a lot back then my Garage Band...
18:30:47 <EssentialChaos[m> <joshman[m] "Linux is no better than outdated"> Unless Apple kills of backwards compatibility
18:31:19 <EssentialChaos[m> > Unless Apple kills of backwards compatibility
18:31:19 <EssentialChaos[m> And then you will have a more or less secure, but outdated and unusable OS
18:31:41 <joshman[m]> Well, 7yo laptops are not only end of support. They're literally end of life
18:31:56 <generateduser392> newest macos already killed off 32-bit and vulkan
18:32:16 <generateduser392> can't even emulate some games
18:32:31 <EssentialChaos[m> MacOS killed Vulkan?
18:32:37 <jalb66> At least you can compose music easily ð
18:33:44 <generateduser392> <jalb66 "At least you can compose music e"> peak of my musical talent is smashing random things together to create "music"
18:33:51 <jalb66> lol
18:34:34 <jalb66> It's never too late to learn
18:36:33 <jalb66> I read in the website that Daniel is thinking to replace the Linux kernel sooner or later for another one, do you know something more about it?
18:37:46 <generateduser392> <EssentialChaos[m "MacOS killed Vulkan?"> either that or opengl, something for emulating games
18:38:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <jalb66 "I read in the website that Danie"> Only that it's supposed to be a microkernel
18:38:59 <EssentialChaos[m> Hmmm, afaik, neither Vulkan nor OpenGL were made to emulate games
18:39:26 <generateduser392> <EssentialChaos[m "Hmmm, afaik, neither Vulkan nor "> yuzu emulator requires it to emulate switch games
18:39:27 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "MacOS killed Vulkan?"> It pretty much just uses Metal I think people got Vulkan working
18:39:56 <cn3m[m]> Metal is fantastic, but it's too exclusive
18:40:30 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m, ok thanks
19:29:14 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: no, I don't know anything about a replacement kernel. That's an aspiration/desire for the future, but it won't happen unless the project becomes sustainable.
19:29:48 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, thx
19:33:56 <skwisgaar[m]> Hey JollyRoger! Had a question about something you said a little while back, that signal is best run with no VPN for the e2e and anonymity from AWS to work properly. Does this advice apply in general to other e2e applications, or is this more of a signal only recommendation?
19:34:46 <TheJollyRoger> skwisgaar[m]: That recommendation I made is only for Signal.
19:35:34 <skwisgaar[m]> TheJollyRoger: ok thanks
19:35:40 <mxnorvak[m]> I thought Amazon requested that Signal stops using AWS for cover
19:36:08 <TheJollyRoger> It did, but Amazon still hosts 60% of backends, including Signal.
19:36:57 <TheJollyRoger> With a VPN you're just moving the man in the middle anyways.

20:12:11 <altoslos[m]1> is there a way to get rid of the "this phone is loading a different operating system" message on boot up?
20:12:20 <jalb66> altoslos[m]1, no, it's normal
20:12:29 <jalb66> You must pay attention that the colour is yellow

20:15:17 <lucky[m]2> what am i doing wrong
20:16:14 <jalb66> AUditor is a great tool, and messaging could be something you'll need to receive SMS in some service
20:16:58 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: you may need to try with curl.exe
20:17:03 <altoslos[m]1> yeah but im replacing messaging with signal, and i probably wont use auditor
20:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> The instructions list: "you will need to reference curl as curl.exe"
20:17:42 <jalb66> IN Windows is curl.exe
20:17:55 <TheJollyRoger> altoslos[m]1: I would not recommend disabling auditor or messages. They won't include any attack surface and Auditor should be considered to be a part of the operating system.
20:17:56 <jalb66> Follow the instructions step by step
20:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: please read everything thoroughly, there may be some variations on the commands that it may tell you to do.
20:18:28 <TheJollyRoger> Such as invoking curl with curl.exe on windows.
20:19:53 <altoslos[m]1> ok ill keep auditor, but I don't see keeping messaging app since I am using Signal as my SMS app instead
20:20:38 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: please note that the instructions also state that if you do not have a way to obtain signify from your package repository, it does not make any sense to use it.
20:21:01 <lucky[m]2> jalb66: ive been follwing them the best I can
20:21:20 <jalb66> lucky[m]2, please note about the windows versions ð
20:21:21 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: read everything before you begin, not just the commands.
20:21:41 <lucky[m]2> im not doing signify
20:21:53 <TheJollyRoger> You won't need to download the pub file then.
20:22:06 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, thanks, I must leave, I'm working and leaving to go home ð

20:23:25 <lucky[m]2> TheJollyRoger: Hi :)
20:23:35 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: why are you installing minimal ADB and fastboot if you already have fastboot working and the correct version?+
20:24:06 <lucky[m]2> because im following the Techlore guide
20:24:18 <TheJollyRoger> please simply follow the official instructions.
20:24:25 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise I can't help you.
20:24:32 <lucky[m]2> i got lost along the way and im just troubleshooting now
20:24:40 <TheJollyRoger> Minimal or portable ADB and fastboot has a reputation for bricking devices.
20:24:49 <TheJollyRoger> So I strongly suggest you only follow the official guide.
20:24:56 <lucky[m]2> my phone is at the fastboot mode in an unlocked state
20:24:59 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Stop what you are doing.
20:25:10 <lucky[m]2> Protduct revision says: blueline MP1.0)ROW)
20:25:15 <TheJollyRoger> Because chances are if you're using minimal adb/fastboot YOU WILL END UP WITH A BRICK
20:25:27 <TheJollyRoger> Let me restate.
20:25:32 <TheJollyRoger> YOU WILL SOFTBRICK.
20:25:36 <lucky[m]2> oh
20:25:46 <TheJollyRoger> So.
20:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> Please stop what you are doing and I can try to help you through this, but remember I'm not sitting next to you.
20:26:45 <lucky[m]2> ok im up to obtaining the factory files and I have the file downloaded and extracted

20:27:11 <TheJollyRoger> So I can't see what you're doing and I'm going to have to take your word for it -- but if you are willing to playball with me, I can help you.
20:27:12 <lucky[m]2> ive been stuck here for hours
20:27:30 <lucky[m]2> i agree
20:27:42 <jalb66> One last thing: are you downloading the version to your Pixel?
20:27:44 <jalb66> Bye
20:27:45 <lucky[m]2> ill send as many screenshots for confirmation as wel
20:27:49 <lucky[m]2>  * ill send as many screenshots for confirmation as well
20:28:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ok great -- this step, you're going to skip because you are on Windows. First, I want to get some quick sanity checks as to where you are.
20:28:37 <TheJollyRoger> I want you to go back to powershell and type in `fastboot --version` without the backticks. I am using the backticks to indicate only where the command begins and ends.
20:28:42 <TheJollyRoger> Tell me the result.
20:29:16 <lucky[m]2> ok ready
20:29:50 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot --version
20:29:59 <TheJollyRoger> Into powershell.
20:30:11 <TheJollyRoger> Also, are you on Windows 10?
20:30:51 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (45KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/LPceMxotYmhVFVaHwIEvXpQG >
20:30:52 <lucky[m]2> yes im in win 10
20:31:15 <TheJollyRoger> You typed it in wrong. fastboot doesn't have a d.
20:31:59 <lucky[m]2> oh shit
20:32:03 <TheJollyRoger> I see that you previously had fastboot installed with the correct version, then I saw you had posted a screenshot of a minimal adb installation.
20:32:11 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (14KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/bQwnQudYFYlkHVXEnyWnCfxs >
20:32:28 <TheJollyRoger> Because I don't know how far you went with that, we NEED to check your version of fastboot.
20:32:47 <lucky[m]2> during the before installation I was prompted by adb to update my fastboot
20:32:56 <lucky[m]2> can you see the pictuer i posted
20:33:12 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, I can download it. OK good, fastboot is treturning the correct version of fastboot.
20:33:17 <TheJollyRoger> This is important and I'll tell you why:
20:33:46 <TheJollyRoger> Other packaged versions of fastboot often change the versioning to their own ends, and may not support things like autodetection.
20:34:18 <TheJollyRoger> In many cases what happens is these incorrectly versioned distributions of fastboot will fail autodetection, go ahead anyways, and you'll get a softbrick.
20:34:52 <TheJollyRoger> You have the correct fastboot installed and pathed correctly here. DO NOT CHANGE IT.
20:34:57 <lucky[m]2> so i have the right version then
20:34:58 <lucky[m]2> okay
20:35:00 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
20:35:26 <TheJollyRoger> The next thing I want you to do -- what phone do you have?
20:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> Is it a Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, 3XL, 3aXL...?
20:35:45 <lucky[m]2> pixel 3
20:36:01 <lucky[m]2> 3
20:36:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. You will need this: https://releases.grapheneos.org/blueline-factory-2020.06.02.02.zip
20:36:53 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to try this the easy way,
20:37:00 <TheJollyRoger> curl.exe -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/blueline-factory-2020.06.02.02.zip
20:37:30 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, download it in a browser.
20:37:47 <lucky[m]2> done
20:37:49 <TheJollyRoger> And unpack its contents to somewhere you can change your working directory somewhere to.
20:37:59 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (35KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/ypYJUdBERxxqmlugRKjGNOcN >
20:38:06 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. do you see a file called "flash-all.bat" in there?
20:38:39 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Let it download... it may take a while. When it's done it'll return you to the prompt.
20:39:23 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (52KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/DclMlzWWkvcODZGwwazdyjyx >
20:39:26 <lucky[m]2> willl it be in here
20:39:37 <lucky[m]2> or will it pop up in the recently downloaded file folder
20:41:02 <TheJollyRoger> It will be in wherever your working directory was where you ran the command, in which case is likely C:\Users\[yourname]\
20:41:25 <TheJollyRoger> Wait for curl to finish.
20:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> Go into Windows explorer and look for it if you can't find it.
20:42:01 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (32KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/ELLDyoBQuazyIJITcfxJEtUg >
20:42:39 <lucky[m]2> how do i look for it in there?
20:42:41 <lucky[m]2> oooh
20:42:43 <lucky[m]2> wait
20:42:43 <TheJollyRoger> tar xvf blueline-factory-2020.06.02.02.zip
20:42:44 <lucky[m]2> nvm
20:42:58 <TheJollyRoger> then type in
20:43:00 <TheJollyRoger> dir
20:43:03 <TheJollyRoger> and tell me what you see.
20:43:41 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (70KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/YeqqNjeLlMXfzMkeElUDCMFE >
20:44:23 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Let's take a break for a moment and go get your phone. Plug it into the /rear port/ of your PC using a USB-A to USB-C cable.
20:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure that that cable is a good quality one.
20:44:37 <TheJollyRoger> Do NOT use a hub.
20:44:57 <TheJollyRoger> Fastboot will use the entire gamut of features available to USB, and most front ports and hubs skimp on these.
20:45:06 <lucky[m]2> rear port?
20:45:08 <lucky[m]2> ok
20:45:13 <TheJollyRoger> Plug the C end into your phone and start your phone in fastboot. Is the bootloader unlocked?
20:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. Don't use front ports, if your PC has them.
20:45:32 <TheJollyRoger> We've experienced problems with this before because some chassis vendors are cheap brokeasses and don't wire them correctly.
20:46:23 <TheJollyRoger> Get your phone powered on to fastboot. Hold the volumedown button and then with the volumedown button held down press and hold power until it switches on to fastboot.
20:46:25 <TheJollyRoger> Is the bootloader unlocked?
20:47:37 <TheJollyRoger> If not, I want you to do
20:47:40 <TheJollyRoger> fastboot flashing unlock
20:47:42 <lucky[m]2> phone is in fastboot mode.
20:47:43 <lucky[m]2> phone is in unlocked status
20:47:44 <lucky[m]2> yes
20:47:45 <TheJollyRoger> (In powershell)
20:47:46 <TheJollyRoger> Okay, great.
20:48:13 <TheJollyRoger> Return to powershell and type in:
20:48:22 <TheJollyRoger> cd blueline-factory-2020.06.02.02
20:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> Make sure that your prompt updates accordingly to show you that you've changed directories to the one you just unpacked.
20:48:58 <TheJollyRoger> If you need to, you can type in:
20:49:05 <TheJollyRoger> dir flash-all.bat
20:49:15 <TheJollyRoger> Which should tell you if flash-all.bat is in the directory.
20:49:17 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (26KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/SYdtcVClTZrXGLGWZRIzYbYx >
20:49:42 <TheJollyRoger> Great. Alright. Take a deep breath, and type in,
20:49:48 <TheJollyRoger> ./flash-all.bat
20:49:55 <TheJollyRoger> Don't disturb your phone while it's running.
20:50:10 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (28KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/PMSQMacIFkQTEEEcVcYQbLjO >
20:50:36 <lucky[m]2> oh my god its loading
20:50:40 <TheJollyRoger> Perfect. Here we go.
20:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Don't disturb your phone while it loads.
20:50:55 <lucky[m]2> !!
20:51:02 <lucky[m]2> `<waiting for device>`
20:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> Once it's done, it'll return you to the powershell prompt.
20:51:14 <lucky[m]2> in fastbootd on phone
20:51:15 <TheJollyRoger> Is powershell running as administrator?
20:51:29 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, do you see a choice that says,
20:51:34 <TheJollyRoger> "Reboot to bootloader"?
20:51:42 <lucky[m]2> its just running
20:51:47 <lucky[m]2> its still going
20:51:54 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (169KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/OhzsxOBRTAnHRJBacfDftikt >
20:51:59 <lucky[m]2> it stopped for a moment and then did that
20:52:31 <TheJollyRoger>  Ok, let it run, let it run...
20:53:10 <TheJollyRoger> Once you get to fastbootd, you'll need to restart your phone to the bootloader. Use the arrowkeys to indicate your selection.
20:53:19 * lucky[m]2 uploaded an image: image.png (129KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/dsvt.site/qjrekMjERwtmPiOypvhQZLUB >
20:53:20 <lucky[m]2> i didnt touch anything
20:53:51 <TheJollyRoger> What's on your phone right now?
20:54:40 <lucky[m]2> "fastbootd" and a menu below it 0 its colourful
20:54:45 <lucky[m]2>  * "fastbootd" and a menu below it - its colourful
20:54:58 <lucky[m]2> i have the option to reboot, power off, enter recovery
20:56:17 <TheJollyRoger> does it say anywhere "Reboot to bootloader"?
20:56:23 <TheJollyRoger> Under fastbootd
20:56:33 <lucky[m]2> yes
20:56:40 <lucky[m]2> yes
20:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> I just want to do a quick sanity check; select take that option and hit start - it may or may not give you the "no operating system found" error, we're about to find out...
20:57:23 <TheJollyRoger> not quite sure why it didn't flash vendor_a...
20:58:27 <lucky[m]2> no problems
20:58:31 <lucky[m]2> it brought me back to fastboot mode
20:58:39 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. can you hit start?
20:58:50 <TheJollyRoger> It may return you to fastboot mode.
20:58:52 <lucky[m]2> yes im able to. do you want me to?
20:59:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. If it doesn't boot we can always return to fastboot mode, let me try and see what went wrong.
20:59:39 <lucky[m]2> my device is corrupt
20:59:41 <lucky[m]2> b r i c k e d
20:59:48 <TheJollyRoger> No, it's not.
20:59:54 <TheJollyRoger> Return to fastboot using the key sequence.
21:00:04 <lucky[m]2> good ð¤£
21:00:11 <lucky[m]2> google OS is loading up
21:00:26 <TheJollyRoger> As long as you're able to reboot to fastboot, then you're able to revert it.
21:00:28 <orge_td[m]> Lol
21:01:42 <lucky[m]2> im back into fastboot mode
21:02:57 <TheJollyRoger> Hang on just a sec...
21:03:47 <lucky[m]2> aye aye cap'm
21:04:03 <lucky[m]2>  * aye aye cap'n
21:04:11 <TheJollyRoger> Arr, we've seen this error before, I'm just trying to look up how it got fixed.
21:05:31 <TheJollyRoger> The last time -- and the time before -- I saw someone experience this error it was caused by a faulty cable and a connection. Are you using the one that came with your phone?
21:06:40 <lucky[m]2> no for that id have to use my laptop and Id have to repudate `fastboot`
21:07:04 <TheJollyRoger> Are you using USB C to USB C?
21:07:12 <lucky[m]2> theres no USB-c on my pc
21:07:24 <TheJollyRoger> OK. You're using USB-A to USB-C?
21:08:34 <lucky[m]2> A -> C USB connection
21:10:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. I think someone more knowledgeable than I is going to have to take over here (I'm also out of time and need to run for a bit.)
21:10:22 <lucky[m]2> ok
21:11:24 <TheJollyRoger> Not sure if there's a workaround but the last couple of times we saw this happen it was indeed caused by a bad cable.
21:14:24 <TheJollyRoger> I have to go, but you can obtain the official releases from Google if you have to to do a sanity check.
21:14:33 <TheJollyRoger> That said,
21:14:50 <TheJollyRoger> Your device is NOT bricked. As long as you can get fastboot, your device isn't bricked because the bootloader's still intact.
21:16:04 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. I'll try to hurry.
21:16:09 <TheJollyRoger> But I have to be somewhere.
21:18:06 <lucky[m]2> best of luckk, thanks
21:42:05 <rosarium[m]> bloody hell, this is tighter than wrestling briefs of those buff WWE dudes
21:42:12 <rosarium[m]> hope for you Lucky to succeed
21:43:58 <lucky[m]2> TheJollyRoger: im doing it on my laptop right now and my phone is turning off and on rrapidly. i think this is it!! Thanks so much for spelling it out for me
21:46:23 <lucky[m]2> TheJollyRoger: Graphene is on my pc. it was probably the cord or pc
21:48:46 <lucky[m]2> i backed up my phone to my google account. can i restore from there?
23:18:58 <lucky[m]2> can i download discord on graphene
23:19:10 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <lucky[m]2 "can i download discord on graphe"> Last I checked it doesn't work.
23:19:19 <lucky[m]2> mm
23:19:43 <fluoridatedsheep> could get a chromium based browser with cookies saved specifically for discord
23:19:56 <fluoridatedsheep> I hear the main dev loves brave
23:22:25 <fluoridatedsheep> https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html
23:57:25 <TheJollyRoger> fluoridatedsheep: lucky[m]2, I suggest not using a browser that makes money by utilizing intercepts your web traffic in order to monetize the browser by injecting ads.
23:57:37 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: it works? :D
23:57:40 <TheJollyRoger> That's excellent to hear!
23:58:00 <fluoridatedsheep> <TheJollyRoger "fluoridated sheeple: Lucky, I su"> im just trolling, no salt here :)
23:58:00 <TheJollyRoger> lucky[m]2: don't forget to lock your bootloader to enforce signature validation.
23:58:08 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha fluoridatedsheep ah, got it :)
23:58:17 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^
23:59:22 <TheJollyRoger> Once your bootloader is locked, it should report that yellow "Loading a different operating system" caution. If you see that yellow warning, that is good, it indicates the Verified Boot is switched on and enforcing, and you can check the keying by using attestation.app to test remote attestation.
23:59:49 <fluoridatedsheep> i got a pixel shipping pretty cheap, looking forward to this arduous flashing adventure
