00:00:52 <rny> vudu: did you follow the instructions?
00:01:40 <vudu> What instructions? I did everything on the grapheneos website, it s not my first time installing grapheneos, mever had this issue with pixel 3a
00:02:18 <rny> no where in the instructions does it say to use `snapshot-update`
00:02:38 <vudu> Only 4a gave me this error, and after cancelling snapshot-update everything could continue, only i m not sure what the command means and if i canceled something importent
00:03:03 <rny> have you tried reflashing
00:03:10 <timont[m]> i recommand to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc
00:03:17 <timont[m]> thats how  installed
00:03:24 <louipc> maybe u had a stuck update from previous OS
00:03:36 <timont[m]> thats how i installed*
00:03:37 <hypokeimenon[m]> remove that timont
00:03:38 <vudu> I know how 2 install, never had this error before
00:03:40 <louipc> timont[m]: noo thats a bad video :P
00:03:53 <timont[m]> who so?
00:04:18 <louipc> he recommends to do hacky things
00:04:29 <louipc> not recommended
00:04:31 <vudu> But did i cancel something important by typing this command, fastboot snapshot-update cancel?
00:05:13 <louipc> vudu: you canceled some previous update
00:05:14 <timont[m]> oh i see
00:05:16 <vudu> Because now it works fine i can install the device, not sure if i broke something with the command
00:05:46 <rny> if you reflashed, it will be fine
00:06:02 <louipc> it was some update that hadnt been fully applied that was blocking something
00:06:17 <louipc> thats one reason to recommend fully update your phone before installing grapheneos
00:06:22 <vudu> Okeyy , so i m good now
00:06:46 <vudu> I did, but the android software updater is trippin
00:07:12 <louipc> maybe the previous bad ROM
00:07:28 <vudu> Maybe i dont know,
00:07:46 <vudu> Anyone knows what the benefits are from using vpn with graphene?
00:08:24 <louipc> same as vpn with any other os
00:09:22 <vudu> Encrypting data, i read somewhere with vpn apps cannot leak grapheneOS to carried so they dont know that my device runs grapheneos
00:10:39 <vudu> Carrier*
00:19:14 <analtenderloin[m> Hello, quick question, was the decision to not include Gapps in grapheneOS mainly for privacy or is there concerns about security when on the device?
00:23:15 <TheJollyRoger> hello analtenderloin[m, there are several reasons why Google Software Frameworks is not included in GrapheneOS:
00:23:31 <TheJollyRoger> The first one is that Play Services was considered to be invasive.
00:24:40 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't to say that it's not possible to use the factory operating system and have a Google account set up in a way that's *fairly* privacy preserving, GrapheneOS chose to go beyond the norm.
00:28:20 <TheJollyRoger> The second reason is because even if somehow, GrapheneOS wanted to use Play Services, we'd need to pay for them.
00:29:17 <vudu> Pay for a service that can spy on you, thats amazing lol
00:30:09 <TheJollyRoger> vudu: that's part of how Google makes its money though. OEMs have to pay the royalties to get the rights to sell handsets with Google Play Services functionality.
00:31:52 <vudu> Yeah i understand, but its still strange, it s like i m spying in a girls locker room when they shower and than ask the girls 2 pay me for it lol
00:32:01 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, yes, yes indeed!
00:38:08 <timont[m]> thats a funny way to say it
01:01:25 <Dylanger[m]> Has anyone tried adding Google's LPA (eSIM Manager) to Graphene?
01:01:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: yes
01:01:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> It has a dependency on GMS
01:02:26 <timont[m]> I thought it was already added..
01:03:47 <Dylanger[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It has a dependency on GMS"> Calyx has it working, I don't think there are any dependencies on GMS
01:03:56 <Dylanger[m]> I'll have a play with it today
01:05:00 <timont[m]> calyx is only for pixel phones right?
01:10:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Calyx has it working, I don't th"> How does that prove anything?
01:12:18 <Dylanger[m]> "think" being the keyword, gonna have a play with it today
01:14:49 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: we wouldn't have to pay for Play services but we'd need to pay for official CTS compliance testing, we'd need to comply with all the rules
01:14:59 <strcat[m]> which would rule out some of our privacy and security features - beyond just including Google apps and services
01:15:12 <strcat[m]> and we'd need to ship their version of a bunch of components via the Play Store
01:15:15 <strcat[m]> it would not be anything like GrapheneOS
01:15:39 <strcat[m]> we couldn't have features like the Sensors and Network toggles not compliant with CDD, among others
01:15:57 <strcat[m]> we couldn't make changes to a bunch of core OS components since we'd have to ship their versions of the APEXes and apps
01:16:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: there is no royalty for shipping GMS
01:16:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just a bunch of legal contracts
01:16:32 <strcat[m]> shipping Play services has never been considered, it was never an option, it is completely opposed to what we want to do...
01:16:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> And those contracts can be pretty restrictive
01:16:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> And yet manufacturers manage to destroy the security model
01:16:57 <strcat[m]> we couldn't even make an ALTERNATE version of the OS with Play services because they require CDD/CTS compliance for everything you ship
01:17:09 <strcat[m]> not just what you've gotten approved for Play services / Google apps
01:27:31 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: anupritaisno1[m] oh, I see, I see, whoops.
02:51:22 <Dylanger[m]> Does anyone know how to get the device into fastbootd so I can flash the super partition (system, vendor, product etc)
02:58:27 <Guest84879> Is grapheneOS fully ready with the pixel4? I'm thinking of buying that phone specifically for this.
03:00:18 <louipc> pixel 4 no prob
03:40:45 <rny> Dylanger[m]: `fastboot reboot fastboot` when in bootloader mode
03:40:48 <rny> ?
03:41:13 <Dylanger[m]> Will that load the device into fastbootd?
03:42:27 <rny> Dylanger[m]: yes
03:42:37 <rny> my miserable phone is in fastbootd now
03:42:39 <Dylanger[m]> Oh awesome
03:42:40 <Dylanger[m]> Cheers
04:24:41 <organicpumpkin[m> <nscnt "That's why we try to teach the a"> I love that aspect of your approach. It adds so much value to me.

05:02:26 <givin_on_life4[m> no is not
05:02:34 <Lia[m]> Banning seems the only way, honestly.
05:03:21 <kmac_pop[m]> so many banneds
05:03:38 <timont[m]> i dont know who is bot and not bot lol
05:03:55 <skwisgaar[m]> A bunch of these trolls/bots/I have no idea are also in OT channel

05:06:33 <dymaner[m]> yif you dont be dudmb
05:06:37 <dymaner[m]> that be friendly
05:08:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hi everyone. I'm just going to put the IRC channel in moderated mode for a little bit until we can get this sorted out. I apologize for the inconvenience.
05:15:40 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: ban on Matrix side not IRC
05:15:52 <strcat[m]> IRC ban lets them rejoin
05:15:55 <strcat[m]> and it just repeatedly kicks
05:15:58 <strcat[m]> ban Matrix side
05:16:04 <TheJollyRoger> Ok.
05:16:18 <strcat[m]> did you undo moderated mode?
05:16:25 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah it should be undone now.
05:16:29 <strcat[m]> also use remove recent messages on Matrix too
05:16:33 <strcat[m]> for each that you ban
05:16:59 <strcat[m]> Lia (kde): can you join offtopic too
05:17:15 <Liakde[m]> Sure
05:17:19 <strcat[m]> and TheJollyRoger can +o you on IRC to give mod on Matrix
05:17:24 <strcat[m]> I don't have Admin in that channel like I do here
05:17:45 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: get someone to test if they can post?
05:17:48 <strcat[m]> in both
05:18:16 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. Just a sec.
05:19:22 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: test
05:21:05 <njha[m]> wow, matrix moderation tools really are a nightmare :/
05:21:39 <Liakde[m]> Should have used web instead. Can't find delete recent messages option
05:21:48 <timont[m]> Can someone tell what happen?
05:21:57 <strcat[m]> Copperhead raiding the channel again
05:21:59 <strcat[m]> standard stuff
05:22:09 <timont[m]> Copperhead?
05:22:47 <strcat[m]> read the information on the site please
05:22:54 <strcat[m]> I already talked to you about this
05:22:56 <timont[m]> Will do
05:23:58 <timont[m]> But was the "raid" all bots?
05:24:08 <strcat[m]> no
05:24:21 <timont[m]> Or group of people?
05:24:21 <strcat[m]> offtopic channel
05:26:55 <jayell[m]> wow. is this normal? absolutely unbearable. any way to boot these troublemakers out? i cant even keep up and actually had real issues to ask about but ill wait til better times.
05:27:30 <strcat[m]> jayell: just ask now
05:27:40 <strcat[m]> don't let Copperhead trolls deter you from that
05:28:05 <timont[m]>  grapheneOS devs need to upgrade there security here lol
05:28:09 <strcat[m]> overal I recommend using IRC rather than Matrix
05:28:22 <faxing[m]> they've got bigger fish to fry
05:28:29 <strcat[m]> timont: you're very close to being banned for concern trolling
05:28:30 <faxing[m]> also not sure they can do much on that front
05:28:40 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, sounds like a better plan (to use IRC)
05:28:56 <timont[m]> Woops sorry
05:29:01 <faxing[m]> <strcat[m] "overal I recommend using IRC rat"> For everything? or just for servers?
05:29:07 <strcat[m]> stick to on-topic conversations here please and don't cause more problems
05:29:45 <timont[m]> Atleast im not raiding channels
05:30:21 <faxing[m]> <timont[m] "Atleast im not raiding channels"> id watch yourself though bud
05:30:34 <faxing[m]> dont want to be getting banned
05:31:00 <jayell[m]> very good to know. i have hexchat on this machine. better irc to recommend?
05:31:14 <jayell[m]> does that mean the bridge is not two way?
05:31:41 <timont[m]> I mean what is the point if you cant talk anthing
05:32:02 <timont[m]> But yeah sure ban me
05:32:14 <jayell[m]> timont: im gonna call your parents and tell them you need less screen time. please go away
05:32:33 <strcat[m]> timont: I've had enough of the concern trolling
05:32:40 <strcat[m]> you showed up here today, the same day people are raiding the channel
05:32:48 <strcat[m]> you've been repeatedly concern trolling since you got here
05:32:51 <pissplayer1[m]> someone is mad
05:33:09 <timont[m]> What?
05:33:10 <faxing[m]> lol
05:33:23 <timont[m]> I have been herr for 8 months
05:33:33 <faxing[m]> poor guy got banned the second he sent his message lol /s
05:33:42 <timont[m]> As right now
05:34:13 <strcat[m]> faxing: was already likely going to ban him simply for when he joined
05:34:19 <strcat[m]> timont: offtopic channel for offtopic stuff
05:34:25 <strcat[m]> moderating the channel when it's being raided is not us being draconian
05:34:45 <faxing[m]> <strcat[m] "faxing: was already likely going"> Ah okay, I see - I was just kidding either way, though
05:35:13 <timont[m]> <faxing[m] "Ah okay, I see - I was just kidd"> Carefull or might get ban of making a joke
05:35:34 <faxing[m]> <timont[m] "Carefull or might get ban of mak"> come on man let it go.
05:35:40 <faxing[m]> go to off topic or stop
05:35:47 <faxing[m]> eyyyyyyy he's gone!
05:35:49 <faxing[m]> finally
05:36:04 <strcat[m]> they're clearly a concern troll
05:36:05 <Liakde[m]> Welp, and they'd talk bad behind backs, as usual.
05:36:10 <strcat[m]> all they've been doing all day
05:37:12 <strcat[m]> https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concern_troll
05:37:20 <strcat[m]> very common tactic used by Copperhead via sockpuppet accounts
05:39:42 <bentley> is the default captive portal url a graphene one or a google one?
05:39:44 <sonerx[m]> hey
05:39:58 <njha[m]> it's a graphene one
05:40:12 <bentley> how do i change it to google?
05:40:13 <strcat[m]> bentley: https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections covers this
05:40:17 <bentley> oh, thanks
05:40:32 <njha[m]> are you having some issue with the default?
05:40:33 <njha[m]> https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1337605225230766080
05:40:56 <strcat[m]> njha: fixed in latest release
05:40:59 <sonerx[m]> copperhead will the lawsuit better give up already
05:41:05 <strcat[m]> via using connectivitycheck.grapheneos.network
05:41:19 <sonerx[m]>  * copperhead will win the lawsuit better give up already
05:41:20 <njha[m]> that's the tweet I linked to :)
05:41:21 <jayell> ok earlier i asked about lack of notification dots. i have them enabled in settings for phone and signal but never see any dots after missing messages etc
05:41:41 <strcat[m]> sonerx: Copperhead's case doesn't even have a legal basis, and that's after them lying about everything
05:42:18 <bentley> njha[m]: since there are few grapheneos users in my vicinity, it makes me relatively identifiable to wifi owners
05:42:34 <bentley> so if there's an option i'd like to use a google url
05:42:40 <njha[m]> that's actually a good point 🤔
05:42:46 <TheJollyRoger> For now I'll just have to set it this way until I get back to Matrix, just in interim, sorry strcat.
05:44:39 <bentley> thanks strcat
05:46:10 <njha[m]> Settings ➔ Network & internet ➔ Advanced ➔ Internet connectivity check doesn't seem to exist for me though
05:46:23 <njha[m]> unless that's in the next update
05:46:30 <strcat[m]> njha: are you up-to-date
05:46:31 <strcat[m]> what version
05:46:58 <Lia[m]> <njha[m] "unless that's in the next update"> What's the build number of your current OS?
05:47:00 <strcat[m]> bentley: you can use the standard URLs, https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections covers blending in with standard Android devices
05:47:07 <bentley> yes, the setting worked for me.
05:47:44 <njha[m]> 2020.11.05.18
05:47:45 <strcat[m]> imagine wasting your time making new accounts and not realizing I have a way to tell it's the same people
05:47:50 <strcat[m]> njha: not current
05:48:07 <strcat[m]> njha: https://grapheneos.org/releases#changelog
05:48:27 <Lia[m]> <njha[m] "2020.11.05.18"> Update your OS first, It's not available in that version
05:49:11 <njha[m]> ah that's out of date
05:49:26 <njha[m]> hmm OTA in settings didn't find anything
05:51:57 <entry1[m]> You guys handled that very well. Hopefully we can monitor people joining the room and get them banned quicker. That won't be the last of it. At least they were easy to spot
05:52:18 <Lia[m]> Odd. Did Seamless Update Client have Network permission granted?
05:52:19 <Lia[m]> You can do sideloading if you want to
05:53:17 <njha[m]> yup, update client has network granted
05:54:18 <Lia[m]> Odd... Wondering if you use ProtonVPN?
05:55:20 <njha[m]> oh wait this is awkward... I have dnd permanently on so none of the notifications show up
05:55:28 <njha[m]> I haven't used android in years so I didn't know it did that
05:55:29 <strcat[m]> just reboot probably?
05:55:39 <njha[m]> yeah that was it :/
05:55:42 <njha[m]> 🤦‍♂️
05:55:45 <strcat[m]> and btw
05:55:47 <strcat[m]> 1 thing to note
05:55:59 <strcat[m]> latest release using grapheneos.network now instead of grapheneos.org for those checks
05:56:09 <strcat[m]> but the Settings app still uses the grapheneos.org URLs until next release
05:56:12 <strcat[m]> just hadn't updated that yet
05:56:31 <strcat[m]> so when you select 'GrapheneOS' there it still uses the connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org ones
05:56:33 <strcat[m]> til next release
05:56:53 <strcat[m]> atm we don't have code to migrate connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org to  connectivitycheck.grapheneos.network in existing saved settings
05:56:55 <strcat[m]> we could add that
05:57:09 <strcat[m]>  connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org works fine - and it can login to many captive portals fine
05:57:36 <strcat[m]> the issue is that when you use a network with a really terrible one that requires browser login instead of the OS login interface
05:57:45 <strcat[m]> the notification from the OS will pass  connectivitycheck.grapheneos.org to the browser
05:57:54 <strcat[m]> and grapheneos.org has HSTS so it doesn't work
05:57:55 <Lia[m]> <njha[m] "🤦‍♂️"> Ah.
05:58:06 <strcat[m]> that's why we're moving to grapheneos.network
05:58:10 <strcat[m]> just not totally done the migration
05:58:14 <strcat[m]> can use the standard URLs too though
05:58:17 <njha[m]> that's such a weird feature though, I want my notifications to come through but not make noise
05:58:22 <njha[m]> and instead it just hid all the notifications from me
05:58:32 <Lia[m]> That's why rebooting phones every n hours help sometimes. (For verified boot reasons, and also updates)
05:59:29 <Lia[m]> Just silent your notification sounds  in settings?
05:59:46 <majesticfruit[m]> Someone mind giving a quick summary of what’s going on? Why all the notifications?
05:59:58 <njha[m]> some spammers came in
06:00:02 <njha[m]> nothing of note
06:00:10 <majesticfruit[m]> Ah
06:00:17 <majesticfruit[m]> That’s a pain in the ass
06:00:58 <strcat[m]> njha: you can change notification channel settings
06:01:00 <strcat[m]> to not make noise
06:01:09 <strcat[m]> and yeah you can silence notifications
06:01:14 <njha[m]> thanks, I did figure it out
06:01:16 <strcat[m]> DnD is extreme
06:01:25 <njha[m]> I just need to get used to android again :)
06:02:45 <mjakelski[m]> Does Graphene use proprietary drivers? I would assume so.
06:03:01 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "imagine wasting your time making"> I will admit, Matrix makes it a little _too_ easy to make accounts
06:03:11 <strcat[m]> SwankyBarbecue4: the kernel drivers are all open source
06:03:14 <strcat[m]> for Android, in general
06:03:30 <strcat[m]> firmware is generally proprietary (Qualcomm's late stage boot chain is open source though)
06:03:50 <mjakelski[m]> How 'bout wifi? Bluetooth?
06:03:51 <strcat[m]> and Qualcomm has an SDK that's partly open source in CAF and partly proprietary (OEMs get source, and it's widely distributed, but not actually open source)
06:04:08 <strcat[m]> SDK is the vendor libraries, etc.
06:04:14 <strcat[m]> like GPU driver library
06:05:53 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: the main issue is unlike IRC
06:06:09 <strcat[m]> there isn't a way to just ban them like *@specific_thing
06:06:15 <strcat[m]> reverse dns name or whatever
06:06:28 <Dylanger[m]> You can ban entire servers
06:06:29 <strcat[m]> freenode I can ban people by IP essentially
06:06:39 <Dylanger[m]> Ah right
06:06:41 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: they're just using matrix.org
06:06:43 <strcat[m]> I want to IP ban
06:06:45 <strcat[m]> I can't
06:06:51 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah fair enough
06:07:20 <strcat[m]> freenode doesn't let you use Tor unless you connect to their onion service and authenticate
06:07:22 <strcat[m]> https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat
06:07:29 <strcat[m]> and they have a lot of anti-abuse stuff
06:07:36 <strcat[m]> notice this nearly all happens over Matrix
06:07:38 <strcat[m]> almost always
06:08:11 <strcat[m]> ideally this would just be an IRC channel TBH, too late for that now though, and if we didn't have a Matrix room, others would want to make bridged rooms
06:08:15 <strcat[m]> so don't really have a choice
06:08:23 <strcat[m]> but it makes abuse / ban evasion too easy
06:08:31 <strcat[m]> they can just keep making accounts
06:08:44 <strcat[m]> what are the moderators supposed to do?
06:08:47 <strcat[m]> it's broken.
06:09:03 <Dylanger[m]> Hm true
06:09:12 <strcat[m]> next time I'll just disabling joining the channel on Matrix
06:10:21 <Dylanger[m]> Matrix are working on fixing the issues with abuse, I exclusively use Matrix/Element haven't touched IRC for many years
06:10:33 <Dylanger[m]> I'm sure they're working on bettering moderation right now
06:10:51 <strcat[m]> the bridge is also really broken atm
06:10:57 <strcat[m]> they need to deploy the new version of it at least
06:10:58 <strcat[m]> for matrix.org
06:11:21 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah we're still on room version 1
06:11:28 <bentley> Dylanger, what fixes for abuse are they making?
06:11:32 <Dylanger[m]> This room is vulnerable to state resets
06:11:36 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: because they created this channel
06:11:38 <strcat[m]> we didn't
06:11:51 <strcat[m]> the matrix.org bridge made this channel
06:12:01 <strcat[m]> we just used the existing channel
06:12:22 <strcat[m]> doesn't upgrading mean everyone on Matrix has to click a button to rejoin?
06:12:22 <Dylanger[m]> You can upgrade it, any admin can, it shouldn't break the bridge
06:12:25 <strcat[m]> that's really annoying
06:12:38 <strcat[m]> I'm not really supposed to be an admin here per the bridge
06:12:44 <strcat[m]> I asked Matrix admins to make me an admin here
06:12:47 <strcat[m]> I don't have admin in offtopic yet
06:12:55 <strcat[m]> I can't get it without manual intervention by the admins
06:13:07 <strcat[m]> the bridge may not be able to handle me upgrading the room
06:13:16 <strcat[m]> I'm not testing it here
06:13:20 <strcat[m]> has to be tested somewhere else 1st
06:13:23 <Dylanger[m]> Better than someone doing a state reset tho, that would totally mess this room up
06:13:35 <Dylanger[m]> Fair enough, just know v1 has security issues
06:14:34 <strcat[m]> upgrading the room may brick it
06:14:43 <strcat[m]> I didn't choose that they made it v1 from the start
06:14:52 <strcat[m]> the bridge making it as a v1 room makes me think it can't handle newer
06:15:12 <Dylanger[m]> Lemme ask around
06:15:35 <strcat[m]> matie2: just stop
06:15:41 <matie2[m]> ??
06:15:44 <matie2[m]> what??
06:15:54 <strcat[m]> stop raiding our channels
06:16:02 <strcat[m]> don't you have something better to do?
06:16:15 <matie2[m]> i get pay for this so no
06:16:19 <strcat[m]> paid how much
06:16:38 <matie2[m]> alot 10 euro per hour
06:16:41 <Dylanger[m]> Troll confirmed, his keys match the other dude
06:16:53 <Dylanger[m]>  * Troll confirmed, his keys match the other person
06:17:15 <strcat[m]> matie2: who pays you then
06:17:20 <strcat[m]> that's not a lot of money
06:17:38 <matie2[m]> for me it is and second cant tel
06:17:43 <strcat[m]> yeah, you can tell
06:18:14 <matie2[m]> i got to pay first
06:19:24 <matie2[m]> alright i will stop
06:19:46 <matie2[m]> but copperhead wont be happpy with this
06:19:53 <naketman14[m]> hey
06:20:09 <naketman14[m]> who?
06:20:09 <Liakde[m]> Thanks for confirming this ^^

06:21:05 <matie2[m]> but yeah will stop now
06:21:24 <matie2[m]> last thing i just wanting to say this is not copperhead
06:21:37 <matie2[m]> but a random guy from the internet
06:21:54 <matie2[m]> who testing a exploit in matrix
06:22:34 <strcat[m]> we know Copperhead is paying you
06:22:39 <matie2[m]> if you want to you can ban and i will leave be but if you let me i can explain
06:23:02 <Lia[m]> So that's where their money go lmao, what a waste. Can't even get a proper dev team to port security patches on time lol
06:23:12 <Lia[m]> What a joke.
06:23:14 <strcat[m]> an "exploit" lol
06:23:19 <strcat[m]> Lia: yeah they pay some guy on fiverr to raid the channel
06:23:26 <strcat[m]> and he's not even smart enough to keep his mouth shut and then tries to cover that up
06:25:27 <Liakde[m]> Lmao. It's kept on the logs anyways.. *shrugs*
06:26:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "an "exploit" lol"> sudo su

06:55:18 <Dylanger[m]> Neat, eSIM is working
06:55:26 <Dylanger[m]> Graphene, Sunfish
06:55:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: OT
06:55:55 <Dylanger[m]> ot?
06:56:05 <Lia[m]> User-installed microG?
06:56:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is a google app, not really on topic for graphene
06:56:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: even if it does work it is a google app
06:56:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need our own replacement for it
06:57:18 <Dylanger[m]> Agree, stoked this is working anyway needed it
06:57:27 <Dylanger[m]> Does an implementation exist already?
06:57:33 <Dylanger[m]> FOSS
06:57:36 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: is it a priv-app
06:57:37 <strcat[m]> or a regular app
06:57:42 <strcat[m]> I assume priv-app
06:57:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: I told you, we only have enrollment broken
06:57:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can enroll on the stock ROM
06:57:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> And then flash graphene
06:58:30 <Dylanger[m]> It's a priv-app, but you could grant the permissions to a user app iirc
06:58:35 <Dylanger[m]> With the carrier permission?
06:58:47 <Dylanger[m]> Been a while since I looked at it
06:58:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just enroll on stock and then flash graphene
06:59:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: basically Google's enrollment app is a gms dependent app
06:59:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Actually, there's no dependency on gms at all
07:00:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> The app just checks if the google play services app exists and crashes if it doesn't
07:00:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Shipping a noop app that just has the package name for play services is enough to make it work
07:01:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can pm disable microg and it still works
07:01:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's quite stupid
07:03:49 <Dylanger[m]> It works as microG being a userapp as well
07:04:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dylanger: please move this to OT
07:04:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> And delete those images
07:05:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is not going to be implemented this way on graphene
07:05:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> And right now those images might make people think we have a fix already
07:05:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> When we do not
07:13:04 <Dylanger[m]> Promoting discussion around this is good, if another mod wants to censor that, feel free
08:26:37 <sine> Howdy everyone. Quick question. Trying to avoid purchasing another locked Pix 3.  This new seller is offering a Pix 3 and has stated "It's unlocked. I bought it through Google fi but I've been using a Verizon sim" and also "The Google fi sim is built-in but you don't have to use it. It'll work with any other network"
08:27:39 <sine> Is this something that will hinder an installation of GraphOS?
08:28:41 <Liakde[m]> enable adb and run `adb shell getprop ro.boot.cid`
08:28:41 <Liakde[m]> if that is `00000000`, it's not a locked variant
08:29:06 <Liakde[m]> If you have a laptop and adb installed with you, the option to see above is feasible
08:31:45 <sine> True.  But wouldn't becoming a "developer" and making sure OEM is unlockable provide me with the same assurance?
08:33:15 <sine> I do have an older MacbookPro I could bring along when I meet up with the guy. This is a cash transaction on Offerup
08:33:39 <Liakde[m]> nice, just make sure adb is installed there
08:36:39 <Liakde[m]> You can do that with similar instruction on grapheneos.org/install to set the path btw, then test it by `adb --version` if it's detected
08:37:33 <sine> I will using the Standalone platform-tools.  But what about the question I raised? More out of curiosity than anything else: wouldn't I be assured the phone isn't locked once I confirm that the OEM  unlocking isn't grayed out?
08:38:29 <Liakde[m]> The adb stuff is to make sure it is indeed flashable and unlockable/relockable
08:39:31 <sine> Copy you. Thnks Liakde!
08:55:44 <noctux> hmm, I'm thinking about installing graphenos to my new phone, but recently coronatracing stuff has gotten quite important. For Germany, there is a FOSS-fork https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android that does tracing without gapps/microg. Anyone given it a try on graphene and can tell me whether it works? $websearch was unfortunately not helpful
09:08:17 <noctux> Ah: https://codeberg.org/corona-contact-tracing-germany/cwa-android/issues/26#issuecomment-162302 people seem to be using it successfully, nice
09:12:25 <r0tt0r[m]> <noctux "hmm, I'm thinking about installi"> besides that, there is somehow no real use of that. my parents use it and got a notification they were near an infected. great, so what you do with that info?
09:12:35 <r0tt0r[m]> but its offtopic i just realised, sry

12:01:05 <vudu> Hi, i wonder why i cant see the database from my signal app in grapheneos? I want to clean it but nothing shows in the map?
12:03:14 <jpds> vudu: In the map?
12:03:43 <vudu> When i go to files, and then select the signal file,
12:04:05 <vudu> There only a subfile: backups, but thats empty 2,
12:04:19 <jpds> The app data isn't stored on the filesystem
12:04:31 <vudu> Where can i find it?
12:04:59 <vudu> I am using a pixel 4 with the latest grapheneos
12:06:16 <jpds> I'm not actually sure if there's a readily-available way to get to it
12:06:40 <jpds> Best way to clean it would be to do it from within the app
12:07:07 <vudu> But if i delete the comversation in the app, wil it also be wiped from the database?
12:07:43 <jpds> Of course
12:07:57 <vudu> Because i ve been reading about cellebrite able to restore deleted conversation from signal
12:08:23 <jpds> That's for #grapheneos-offtopic, and that whole article was nonsense
12:09:05 <vudu> Okeyy, so cleaning signal is just deleting comversations in the app
12:09:10 <vudu> Thanks for the help
12:10:44 <jpds> vudu: https://nitter.net/moxie/status/1337434126186553345
12:21:13 <kopolee11[m]> I have a GrapheneOS.org suggestion. Consider adding a tab that says devices supported (I'm thinking between the features and install tab). You would include the information from the FAQ, and also a table with the supported devices and the contact info of the maintainers (if they're okay with that)
12:21:13 <kopolee11[m]> I think it will make it clearer in terms of why devices like the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 aren't supported, and what it would take for them to get supported.
12:21:13 <kopolee11[m]> I don't have much HTML experience, but it this is a good idea I could try making an official pull request.
12:22:11 <somenerd[m]> I think it's on the FAQ
12:22:23 <jpds> kopolee11[m]: Sure, put in a pull request: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org
12:22:38 <somenerd[m]>  * I think it's on the FAQ (nvm reread the message)
12:25:09 <thran> Hi, I've recently installed Graphene and greatly appreciate having a privacy conscious OS.
12:25:16 <thran> However, while I've found superior F-droid alternatives for many of my usual apps, unfortunately in a few cases it is impossible for me to live without Google Play Services' notification component. I've installed Micro G services and the microG services framework Proxy (GmsCore), but I haven't been able to recieve notifications from these GP-dependent apps. Would anyone mind sharing some advice? Thanks.
12:25:46 <somenerd[m]> MicroG isn't supported by GrapheneOS
12:26:48 <thran> I have it installed, but I take it you mean MicroG and access to Google is blocked at a lower level?
12:27:58 <somenerd[m]> I believe that there should be support within the OS
12:28:02 <jpds> thran: It's not so much blocked, you have compile in microg when you build the sources for graphene itself
12:28:05 <somenerd[m]> in order for it to work
12:28:29 <thran> Like I'd really rather not have to use MicroG or anything from the big G, but unfortunately too many people I know use certain messaging apps that rely on it.
12:29:20 <somenerd[m]> I believe you have to compile in MicroG, like jpds said
12:29:39 <thran> @jpds, if I have to compile in support, I suppose I now have a project for the holidays lol
12:30:49 <thran> I've battled both Autoconf and Cmake, so I'm not too afraid. I'll take a look.
12:31:33 <thran> Thanks for your help, and your work on the OS. Hopefully someday we won't need to rely on any services from Big G at all.
12:33:25 <somenerd[m]> I'm looking forward to the MicroG inclusion in GrapheneOS
12:38:40 <Golli[m]2> When/if it does come, I hope we can have a toggle for it for each app like we can toggle other permissions (Sensors, Networking, Location, etc).
12:40:29 <thran> Is it in the pipeline, or is it something the maintainers would object to? Similar to how some Linux distros would be strict against non-free code.
12:40:40 <thran> *strictly
12:42:59 <Liakde[m]> > <@lelmister101:matrix.org> I'm looking forward to the MicroG inclusion in GrapheneOS
12:42:59 <Liakde[m]> >
12:42:59 <Liakde[m]> Not exactly "included", but will support some time in the future as a user app, not a system app.
12:46:11 <Liakde[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
15:21:14 <refraction[m]> Hello. I've went and bought a Pixel and flashed GrapheneOS onto it, but when I ran Auditor it told me there was an errror verifying attestation.
15:21:32 <refraction[m]> I'm wondering if anyone would have an idea of what might have went wrong?
15:23:08 <Liakde[m]> Is the date of auditor and auditee set right?
15:24:14 <refraction[m]> Should be, though they were set in different timezones
15:24:15 <Liakde[m]> <Liakde[m] "Is the date of auditor and audit"> As in the phones used for attestation
15:24:29 <refraction[m]> Would that cause a problem?
15:24:44 <Liakde[m]> It shouldn't
15:25:48 <refraction[m]> I'll try and pick the same timezone to eliminate that anyway I guess
15:26:03 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, you can try that
15:26:41 <Liakde[m]> Otherwise, if it still fails, you can pretty much reflash
15:27:09 <refraction[m]> Wait, does the Auditor have to be unrooted?
15:27:31 <Golli[m]> refraction: Restart your Pixel.
15:27:34 <Golli[m]> I had the same issue and restarting it fixed it.
15:28:13 <Liakde[m]> <Golli[m] "I had the same issue and restart"> Oh yeah, forgot about restarting and verified boot doing its thing, yeah, try that first
15:45:34 <refraction[m]> <Golli[m] "I had the same issue and restart"> Let me try that
15:55:44 <refraction[m]> <Golli[m] "I had the same issue and restart"> Doesn't seem to be working
15:56:18 <Liakde[m]> Guess reflashing it is then?
15:56:43 <refraction[m]> Yeah. Unless the Auditor is not supposed to be rooted?
15:57:05 <somenerd[m]> rooted?
15:57:14 <Liakde[m]> Wdym rooted?
15:57:34 <Liakde[m]> Auditor is bundled into the OS, but doesn't have root access
15:57:58 <refraction[m]> No, I mean the other phone doing the Auditing
15:58:23 <somenerd[m]> I think that doesn't run GrapheneOS then
15:58:50 <refraction[m]> Yeah
15:59:01 <somenerd[m]> which is why it probably won't work
15:59:08 <refraction[m]> I was just using my old phone with Auditor installed on it
15:59:22 <Liakde[m]> <refraction[m] "No, I mean the other phone doing"> Probably, do you have another stock Android, or at lease custom OS without root
15:59:33 <Golli[m]> refraction: What phone are you using to audit your Pixel?
16:00:16 <refraction[m]> <Golli[m] "refraction: What phone are you u"> It's a Nokia 7 Plus flashed with Pixel Experience
16:01:07 <refraction[m]> Yeah. I got a successful verification with a stock Android phone with no root
16:01:41 <refraction[m]> Guess you can't use a rooted phone to do Auditing
16:01:47 <Liakde[m]> Ah, that's a relief then, the flashing itself was a success
16:02:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> refraction: you are using an unsupported modified OS
16:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only stock is supported
16:02:22 <refraction[m]> Thanks for the help Lia (kde): and Golli
16:02:29 <refraction[m]> anupritaisno1: I see
16:03:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <refraction[m] "anupritaisno1: I see"> Use the stock OS on your Nokia to verify the attestation
16:04:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> These terrible custom ROMs often break a lot of things
16:05:08 <refraction[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Use the stock OS on your Nokia t"> Understood
17:13:09 <organicpumpkin[m> So even a non-rooted lineageos phone wont work for that?
17:13:42 <somenerd[m]> probably not
17:19:43 <nscnt> I don't know why it wouldn't work. Auditor device (device that performs verification) that's compatible with Android 7.0+ and with a camera should be fine
17:20:21 <somenerd[m]> Stock is supported?
17:20:26 <somenerd[m]>  * Stock is the only onesupported?
17:20:32 <somenerd[m]>  * Stock is the only one supported?
17:20:37 <somenerd[m]> (I believe)
17:20:43 <nscnt> Yea, just read. Nvm my message
17:22:03 <assman> Does volte work for anyone on art?
17:23:08 <assman> *at&t
17:24:36 <nscnt> Well, I read the message from anupritaisno1[m] but I lack the idea why the Auditor device would need to be stock Android (or ofc GrapheneOS)
17:30:54 <nscnt> Mh, nevermind. Everything else is just not _officially_ supported, I guess. It could work, though?
17:35:46 <faxing[m]> <assman "Does volte work for anyone on ar"> I don't have ATT but I've heard people saying that it worked - so y'know it's a gamble.
17:38:15 <joehandcockandja> Mine doesn't
17:38:43 <joehandcockandja> It always switches over to 4G only for phone calls
17:38:54 <joehandcockandja> If I change it to LTE only mode, can't make phone calls
18:38:21 <organicpumpkin[m> Does VoLTE not work for any carriers? Or is it hit and miss?
19:00:47 <jayell> help
19:01:43 <jayell> oops, wrong screen
19:10:31 <strcat[m]> refraction: time zone isn't an issue, the time should be correct on both though
19:11:05 <strcat[m]> refraction: you can use any Android 7+ phone as the Auditor, it doesn't verify that phone, it verifies the Auditee
19:11:32 <strcat[m]> if it's failing that indicates that you device is not running GrapheneOS, or you're screwing up something about the verification process
19:11:37 <strcat[m]>  * if it's failing that indicates that your device is not running GrapheneOS, or you're screwing up something about the verification process
19:12:17 <strcat[m]> Golli: there won't be a toggle, it's not how things work, and microG will never be part of GrapheneOS, we've published what our plans our for that
19:13:14 <brethberie[m]> Posted this in the Graphene subreddit and was referred here. When I connect my Pixel phone to my Mac the phone defaults to charge only with no data transfer. I am able to switch the USB preferences but whenever I restart the phone to get to the bootloader that selection resets to "no data transfer". This results in an endless loop of < waiting for device > when I run "fastboot flashing lock"
19:14:02 <strcat[m]> refraction: unless the device you were using as the Auditor is totally broken, it should be working fine, what's happening is that it's detecting something is wrong and you've found an incorrect reason to ignore what it's telling you
19:14:03 <strcat[m]> which is unfortunate
19:14:46 <strcat[m]> brethberie: changing that is not part of installing GrapheneOS, that just changes the mode of the device (as a USB peripheral itself) within the OS
19:15:02 <strcat[m]> brethberie: the flashing process does not take place within the OS, that doesn't do anything relevant
19:15:48 <strcat[m]> brethberie: are you following https://grapheneos.org/install ?
19:16:02 <strcat[m]> did you already install GrapheneOS and need to lock now?
19:16:13 <strcat[m]> the instructions have you do that right after flashing
19:17:08 <brethberie[m]> Yes install process has been completed. Am I unable to lock the bootloader on MacOS if install was performed on Linux?
19:17:22 <strcat[m]> no reason you can't do that
19:17:38 <strcat[m]> why not do it where you started it and had fastboot working?
19:17:53 <strcat[m]> the official install process has you do that before rebooting so you don't forget
19:21:14 <brethberie[m]> <strcat[m] "why not do it where you started "> One computer is always with me one is not. I've reinstalled fastboot multiple times and updated pathname. Fastboot --version returns: "fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874". I've tested multiple different USB-C cables including the one that came with the phone. fastboot flashing lock always results in: < waiting for device >
19:24:54 <emsyna[m]> use USB A to USB C cable
19:28:50 <entryware[m]> Isn't this a permission issue?
19:30:23 <strcat[m]> brethberie: the phone is in fastboot mode (not recovery)?
19:30:26 * brethberie[m] uploaded an image: IMG_1141.JPG (4216KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/okceZOvkwLQgkVEgRyRwSybY/IMG_1141.JPG >
19:30:35 <strcat[m]> brethberie: as I said that is not relevant
19:30:36 <brethberie[m]> <emsyna[m] "use USB A to USB C cable"> I tried this as well no look.
19:30:55 <strcat[m]> brethberie: fastboot does not involve the OS, does not connect to the OS, and that OS setting has no relevance
19:31:13 <strcat[m]> you are supposed to boot it into the bootloader menu
19:31:54 <strcat[m]> the USB mode in the OS has no relevance and is supposed to start at no data transfer
19:32:05 <strcat[m]> it doesn't remember the setting, it would be insecure, this is how AOSP works
19:32:06 <brethberie[m]> I understand that but the computer itself won't recognize the phone at all in any of those modes. Aside from the fastboot issue it won't let be switch USB controlled by connected device. That being said I am in the bootloader menu when running all fastboot commands.
19:32:22 <strcat[m]> sounds like you don't have a working cable/port then
19:32:58 <strcat[m]> you'll be able to finish it without trouble on the computer where you did 90% of it
19:33:05 <brethberie[m]> 3 different cables all of which work with other devices. 4 different ports on 6 month old Macbook all of which work on other devices.
19:33:06 <strcat[m]> or you can figure out why this computer doesn't have working USB
19:33:25 <strcat[m]> brethberie: working with other devices doesn't mean they are working cables
19:33:30 <strcat[m]> use the cable that came with the phone
19:33:37 <strcat[m]> lots of USB cables aren't spec compliant
19:33:54 <strcat[m]> especially ones that come with most other phones
19:33:57 <brethberie[m]> USB cable shipped by google in the google pixel 3 packaging did not work.
19:34:10 <strcat[m]> plugging it directly into the computer?
19:34:36 <brethberie[m]> Yes no adapters USBC to USBC
19:37:19 <brethberie[m]> Is this a compatibility issue or is the only time you can lock the bootloader immediately after install?
19:37:49 <strcat[m]> no
19:37:51 <strcat[m]> you can lock it any time
19:38:02 <strcat[m]> the instructions tell you to do it then, and that was the best time to do it
19:38:04 <strcat[m]> but you still can
19:38:09 <strcat[m]> you're having an issue with USB
19:38:22 <strcat[m]> I strongly recommend using the computer you started the process on
19:38:32 <strcat[m]> if not, you'll need to figure out why USB isn't working
19:52:26 <fll[m]> Yea, might be a "bad" USB cable, might be an issue with the USB port / USB controller / driver for that controller
22:16:51 <adeus[m]> I’m trying setup 2 GraphenOS devices to send to people in my circle. They are tech illiterate. Previously I sent them iPod Touches and used a free and awesome MDM platform called Jamf to manage problems. Anyone can give a plug to any MDM they used with GrapheneOS or Android in general they recommend ?
22:19:14 <adeus[m]> Hey will Kiosk mode work on GrapheneOS?
22:41:44 <Liakde[m]> Try asking in the offtopic channel #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org but personally, I don't have any plug or recommendations of any MDM platforms
22:44:52 <adeus[m]> Thanks !
