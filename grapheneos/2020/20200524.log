00:00:34 <strcat[m]> cn3m: the Linux kernel is increasingly what's exploited as userspace security on OSes like AOSP has gotten so much better
00:00:38 <strcat[m]> sandboxing has gotten so much stronger, etc.
00:01:10 <strcat[m]> cn3m: for local privesc it's already mostly how it's done
00:01:24 <strcat[m]> cn3m: the ONLY layer of security is the linux kernel
00:02:48 <cn3m[m]> it was insane
00:02:49 <cn3m[m]> that's what I remember playing with Android-x86(which I know is shit) and it had no restrictions at all since no SELinux
00:02:56 <cn3m[m]> that's what I remember playing with Android-x86(which I know is shit) and it had no restrictions at all since no SELinux
00:02:57 <cn3m[m]> it was insane
00:04:15 <cn3m[m]> double send whoops
00:04:16 <cn3m[m]> double send whoops
00:05:54 <strcat[m]> lol it's funny that stuff like anbox disables selinux
00:06:01 <strcat[m]> and makes it seem like they are improving security or isolating it better
00:06:06 <JTL> Oh god
00:06:11 <strcat[m]> when really they make it easier for an app to compromise the kernel
00:06:18 <strcat[m]> or escape from the sandbox, or steal user data, w/e
00:06:23 <strcat[m]> even outside their container
00:07:08 <strcat[m]> selinux is not some extra layer for the android security model
00:07:12 <strcat[m]> it largely is the security model
00:07:27 <strcat[m]> you can't do what it does via POSIX users/groups, etc.
00:07:37 * madaidan[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200524_010740_291.jpg (9KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ewvznXnWsWsMEoPlHoiXHjhU >
00:07:43 <strcat[m]> lol
00:07:43 <madaidan[m]> Press (X) to doubt
00:07:55 <JTL> Press (X) for "marketing bullshit"
00:08:00 <strcat[m]> it runs the whole userspace inside namespaces (not a security feature or sandbox)
00:08:02 <strcat[m]> with selinux disabled
00:08:27 <strcat[m]> namespaces make things separate - it does not in any way defend the kernel tho
00:08:43 <strcat[m]> so it gives you a separate android and non-android userspace
00:09:05 <strcat[m]> but they are making the app sandbox way worse including exploiting the kernel and taking over the whole OS
00:09:09 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "lol it's funny that stuff like a"> such bullshit
00:09:09 <cn3m[m]> Anbox talks the talk with their patch level from '17
00:09:37 <strcat[m]> I mean patch level is also pretty meaningless when you disable mandatory security features like 90% of the security model
00:09:57 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "Anbox talks the talk with their "> "but it uses a mount namespace that doesn't matter!1!!!"
00:13:56 <strcat[m]> I think regardless of what happens in the future, it'll be important to have backwards compat with existing apps
00:14:03 <strcat[m]> and the app permission / security model matters
00:14:24 <strcat[m]> so the improvements to the app security model and APIs are long-lasting
00:14:36 <strcat[m]> regardless of what happens with the kernel, etc.
00:14:40 <cn3m[m]> quick question off topic I know, but LTSC or stock Windows 10 Pro for best privacy and security balance?
00:16:28 <strcat[m]> cn3m: you would be better off with non-LTSC Enterprise
00:16:29 <strcat[m]> than LTSC
00:16:47 <strcat[m]> it is the Enterprise part of it that you want not LTSC
00:16:56 <cn3m[m]> thanks I can do that
00:18:04 <cn3m[m]> I appreciate the recommendation
00:18:19 <strcat[m]> Enterprise has the fancy stuff like VM-based browser isolation and so on
00:18:48 <strcat[m]> and has finer-grained control over things
00:19:15 <cn3m[m]> thanks, and full telemetry control from what I understand so it should mix everything
00:20:53 <cn3m[m]> VeraCrypt over Bitlocker?
00:25:56 <thelearner[m]> kanuk: try cleaning out the port from lint
00:26:19 <nickcalyx[m]> I still want to know what the deal was when all the veracrypt devs resigned and put out the statement that it could not be trusted
00:28:45 <thelearner[m]> > cn3m: you would be better off with non-LTSC Enterprise
00:28:45 <thelearner[m]> Preferred version of windows?
00:32:21 <qevven[m]> Just got my 3a XL today on sale, so I should update to latest Android update before attempting to flash GrapheneOS correct?
00:33:16 <thelearner[m]> <qevven[m] "Just got my 3a XL today on sale,"> qevven: yes. Go to grapheneos website, install instructions are there.

00:39:27 <thelearner[m]> qevven: what are Samsung phones like or were like?
00:40:01 <thelearner[m]> > I still want to know what the deal was when all the veracrypt devs resigned and put out the statement that it could not be trusted
00:40:01 <thelearner[m]> Would be interested to know to, if that was the case.
00:41:20 <qevven[m]> It was a galaxy S8 running Android 7 or 8 and had Telnet buried in the system not sure if specific to Samsung or Android in general
00:41:39 <strcat[m]> qevven: it was probably just to have the tool for debugging

00:42:58 <qevven[m]> Veracrypt was fork of truecrypt
00:43:27 <strcat[m]> qevven: Android 10 has netcat via toybox
00:43:55 <qevven[m]> Does GrapheneOS have netcat & telnet?
00:44:08 <strcat[m]> qevven: netcat is one of the toybox tools
00:44:31 <qevven[m]> How about hardened IP Tables?
00:44:50 <cn3m[m]> <thelearner[m] "cn3m: All clear on that. :) Coul"> Windows 10 LTSC is essentially Windows 10 1809 with less bloat(store and onedrive for instance). Windows 10 Enterprise with 1909 has better hardening and security features
00:44:55 <strcat[m]> not sure what you mean and seems we jumped to a very diff topic
00:45:45 <qevven[m]> Yeah
00:46:08 <strcat[m]> cn3m: afaik LTSC is an Enterprise feature, it's just an LTS branch of Enterprise
00:46:10 <strcat[m]> LTSC is a short form of Enterprise LTSC
00:46:48 <strcat[m]> there's a yearly LTS
00:46:56 <strcat[m]> so it's missing newer features - cause it's an LTS
00:47:20 <qevven[m]> Why not just use Linux instead of windows?
00:47:38 <strcat[m]> so Enterprise has the fancy extra sec features but if they're new they wouldn't be in LTSC since it's up to a year old
00:47:42 <strcat[m]> year old branch
00:47:50 <madaidan[m]> <qevven[m] "Why not just use Linux instead o"> The conversation was literally about Linux being a massive insecure mess
00:48:06 <qevven[m]> Not quite true..
00:48:20 <madaidan[m]> <qevven[m] "Not quite true.."> It is quite true.
00:49:11 <strcat[m]> cn3m: it's also kinda common throughout different software that there are enterprise only features useful to others
00:49:40 <qevven[m]> I mean windows bitlocker encryption was just recently hacked so..
00:49:41 <strcat[m]> cn3m: like how on AOSP there are nice features they didn't make a Settings app UI to use generally because it's complicated or easy to screw up
00:49:46 <cn3m[m]> Windows 10 or macOS they will defend your private data better qevven:
00:50:08 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: like how on AOSP there are"> gotcha I am grabbing Windows 10 Enterprise per your suggestion
00:50:09 <qevven[m]> Windows 10 is a spying tool are you serious?
00:50:10 <cn3m[m]> thanks
00:50:11 <strcat[m]> cn3m: or on Chromium it's similar, there are features you can toggle via the enterprise policy
00:50:26 <strcat[m]> although with AOSP and Chromium - it's all there in the normal version, it's just the way it's adjusted is an enterprise API
00:50:33 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Windows 10 is a spying tool are "> no it is not, I have MITMd it
00:50:36 <madaidan[m]> <qevven[m] "I mean windows bitlocker encrypt"> I doubt that but here's a few hundred unfixes Linux vulns https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream#open
00:50:44 <thelearner[m]> cn3m and strcat (@strcat:matrix.org) thanks for your comments. :)
00:50:48 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "although with AOSP and Chromium "> I have used Chromium enterprise rules before they are pretty nice
00:50:55 <qevven[m]> Which Linux distro
00:51:00 <qevven[m]> Or kernel?
00:51:02 <madaidan[m]> <qevven[m] "Which Linux distro"> It's in the kernel
00:51:13 <madaidan[m]> Linux has no real security model
00:51:27 <strcat[m]> cn3m: yeah and that's essentially what Vanadium is ending up using for a lot of stuff since we want minimum diff from upstream
00:51:29 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Or kernel?"> the userland for distros is so broken as well
00:51:43 <qevven[m]> Uh Qubes OS ?
00:51:50 <strcat[m]> cn3m: we're changing default settings that exist largely because of the enterprise settings
00:51:57 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: yeah and that's essentiall"> that is a brilliant idea
00:51:58 <cn3m[m]> I should look at your patches
00:52:02 <strcat[m]> qevven: Qubes OS is not really a Linux distro
00:52:22 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Uh Qubes OS ?"> insecure guests and it trusts a lot of maintainers
00:52:26 <strcat[m]> qevven: but the Linux distros running inside it are still vulnerable to any of the regular stuff
00:52:29 <strcat[m]> they aren't more secure
00:52:37 <strcat[m]> what it provides is isolation between those
00:52:46 <strcat[m]> it's a Xen distro at the core
00:53:26 <qevven[m]> How about Clear Linux by Intel
00:54:05 <strcat[m]> QubesOS basically aims to be an alternative to having a stack of laptops if that makes sense
00:54:08 <cn3m[m]> the chances of a truly malicious update being pushed through the Fedora repos is orders of magnitude higher than Windows update
00:54:25 <strcat[m]> instead of having 12 laptops you rely on virtualization to do it in 1
00:54:33 <strcat[m]> which is cheaper and more convenient/portable
00:54:34 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "How about Clear Linux by Intel "> hundreds of unfixed vulns and no user/root isolation same issues
00:54:46 <strcat[m]> but the individuals guests are not more secure
00:54:50 <strcat[m]>  * but the individual guests are not more secure
00:55:18 <qevven[m]> I would think the majority of windows installations around the world are not genuine licenses and use alternative activation methods
00:55:24 * thelearner[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PDfnvPqQxpVPhfKSytdiqdjv >
00:55:28 <strcat[m]> so instead of work laptop and personal laptop you have work guest and personal guest and so on
00:55:33 <strcat[m]> and rely on x86 virtualization + xen
00:55:43 <cn3m[m]> qevven: if you want a secure linux distro the closest you will get is ChromeOS
00:56:26 <qevven[m]> So you guys are in a Graphene OS channel pushing OS with google services which defeats the purpose of this project??
00:56:41 <JTL> ???
00:56:50 <JTL> Oh
00:56:56 <qevven[m]> Are you guys spreading disinformation?
00:57:23 <strcat[m]> there's a different between security and avoiding proprietary services
00:57:34 <strcat[m]>  * there's a difference between security and avoiding proprietary services
00:57:48 <strcat[m]> and GrapheneOS is not simply the stock OS without Google apps and services - that's AOSP without the GrapheneOS changes
00:58:27 <strcat[m]> the purpose of GrapheneOS is taking AOSP, which doesn't have those Google apps and services, and doing privacy/security hardening + filling in functionality gaps
00:58:31 <strcat[m]> so it largely misses the point to say the point is avoiding Google apps and services
00:58:45 <cn3m[m]> the google services are open source on Chromium
00:58:55 <cn3m[m]> by your own definition your argument is moot
00:58:56 <cn3m[m]>  * the google services are open source on ChromiumOS
00:59:21 <strcat[m]> although on mobile they don't use the open source Chromium version they outsource to Play Services when they can
00:59:24 <cn3m[m]> I have several Google apps installed on my GrapheneOS phone
00:59:39 <strcat[m]> you could technically build the open source clients but we don't want that so w/e
00:59:49 <qevven[m]> OpenGapps?
00:59:57 <strcat[m]> I would like to implement Safe Browsing using grapheneos.org tho
01:00:03 <strcat[m]> but it's a super low priority
01:00:25 <strcat[m]> cause enumerating badness is not a viable approach to security - it would just be nice to have best effort phishing protection, etc. based on those blacklists
01:00:43 <strcat[m]> but it requires figuring out how to get the local database Safe Browsing working and how to host it on grapheneos.org
01:00:55 <strcat[m]> the way it works is it hashes a URL
01:01:02 <strcat[m]> and then takes the first few bytes of the hash
01:01:16 <strcat[m]> and downloads a database for all URLs with those first few bytes after hashing them
01:01:20 <strcat[m]> and then that's the db to check
01:01:34 <strcat[m]> anyway it is a super low priority and not particularly interesting imo
01:01:45 <strcat[m]> I would just like to not regress things like that when possible
01:01:51 <cn3m[m]> Yes, I use Safe Browsing with NextDNS over PrivateDNS
01:01:55 <qevven[m]> People can install something like NextDNS which is essentially like a Pi-Hole in the cloud to block malware domains & known phishing sites no?
01:02:34 <cn3m[m]> don't install nextdns
01:02:39 <thelearner[m]> > I have several Google apps installed on my GrapheneOS phone
01:02:39 <thelearner[m]> Didn't think they could work.
01:02:50 <qevven[m]> * People can install something like NextDNS which is essentially like a Pi-Hole in the cloud to block malware domains & known phishing sites no?
01:02:50 <qevven[m]> Even NSA blocklist
01:03:21 <cn3m[m]> use privatedns
01:03:32 <qevven[m]> Why no NextDNS ?
01:04:06 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Why no NextDNS ?"> use NextDNS with the built in PrivateDNS feature
01:04:37 <qevven[m]> Why about IPV6 block?
01:04:51 <qevven[m]> * What about IPV6 block?
01:05:43 <qevven[m]> Some apps attempt to bypass by using internal app DNS
01:06:28 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Why about IPV6 block?"> what about it?
01:07:20 <cn3m[m]> untrusted apps will always find a way around your "privacy" features tacted on
01:08:13 <cn3m[m]> I am a former professional Android and iOS ad tech coder
01:09:52 <qevven[m]> Signal app uses this method to bypass censorship, are you saying Signal is untrusted?
01:10:00 <cn3m[m]> don't run untrusted apps
01:10:03 <cn3m[m]> there's too many ways around it
01:11:36 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Signal app uses this method to b"> are you just trolling or something?
01:11:40 <cn3m[m]> If you rely on adblocking your privacy you probably should be accessing that service from your browser
01:11:53 <cn3m[m]> if Signal is trusted(I trust it, but it is a personal choice), then you don't need to use an adblocker
01:13:01 <cn3m[m]> I have bypassed dns blocks regardless of ipv6 or not
01:15:37 <qevven[m]> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk what to say, guess we have different views on that
01:17:40 <nickcalyx[m]> > so instead of work laptop and personal laptop you have work guest and personal guest and so on
01:17:40 <nickcalyx[m]> No but its different than that. They have all USB stuff in one VM, all network stuff in another VM and them the vulnerable parts are isolated
01:17:47 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk what to say, guess we "> you are looking for poor solutions to problems(that won't be fixed)
01:17:49 <cn3m[m]> NextDNS VPN version is not what you are looking for
01:17:54 <cn3m[m]> use it and block google.com and take bromite with a secure dns that unblocks it
01:18:11 <strcat[m]> if you give an app network access and let it connect to stuff it can clearly exfiltrate data
01:18:35 <strcat[m]> if you allow it access to the app devs own servers you are not really restricting the app developers...
01:18:57 <strcat[m]> same kind of weird misunderstanding as thinking blocking third party code running in a browser prevents third party tracking
01:19:10 <strcat[m]> it just prevents them doing it via the client
01:19:18 <strcat[m]> they can still get it all via the first party
01:19:23 <strcat[m]> including middleware that runs there
01:19:33 <strcat[m]> which is btw how things are becoming now
01:19:36 <qevven[m]> But you can control who it communicates with through block lists
01:20:07 <strcat[m]> qevven: if you let an app talk to the app dev's server
01:20:12 <strcat[m]> a single whitelisted domain / IP
01:20:15 <strcat[m]> it can talk to the whole world
01:20:17 <cn3m[m]> all this stuff is privacy theater like firewalls and network blocks
01:21:01 <strcat[m]> qevven: the app dev can send along your data to facebook or w/e from there
01:21:05 <strcat[m]> they don't need to do that from the client
01:21:14 <strcat[m]> they increasingly don't do it from the client
01:21:38 <strcat[m]> one reason is there are security issues for them with that approach
01:21:53 <strcat[m]> lets say you get some API key from facebook
01:22:07 <strcat[m]> you obviously shouldn't stick that in your app if you don't want junk / malicious stuff being done with it
01:22:20 <strcat[m]> you need to proxy it through your server
01:22:30 <strcat[m]> otherwise anyone else can extract that api key and do w/e with it
01:22:38 <strcat[m]> applies to anything really
01:23:16 <strcat[m]> it's bad practice to include api keys in the client
01:24:20 <strcat[m]> there is a substantial move away from sticking api keys in apps and using services from the app + obfuscating the app and hoping that deters ppl
01:24:39 <strcat[m]> applies to some extent to web sites too
01:25:27 <qevven[m]> But that‚Äôs how many advertisers do it no?
01:25:27 <qevven[m]> When devs are implementing Ad SDKs in their apps they must use api in app to render the ads in view, or has this practice changed in recent years?
01:25:39 <strcat[m]> anyway if you allow an app to communicate with the app devs server you allow it to communicate with anyone
01:25:49 <strcat[m]> since you are trusting the same people who made the app with anything it wants to send
01:26:05 <strcat[m]> to me at least that's obvious
01:26:20 <JTL> Me too
01:26:46 <strcat[m]> similarly if you connect to example.com and allow scripts, etc. from example.com (1st party origin)
01:27:02 <strcat[m]> they can be serving you tons of stuff they didn't write and often are
01:27:16 <strcat[m]> and the data that stuff sends to their server can and is often sent off to assorted third parties
01:27:40 <strcat[m]> blocking third party stuff in the client does not mean third parties can't get the data
01:28:07 <strcat[m]> so this is not a viable approach to real privacy where you have any sort of guarantees / assurance
01:28:21 <strcat[m]> rather, at best, it can block all kinds of assorted things deemed 'bad' and not useful / needed for sites to work
01:28:23 <cn3m[m]> apps are far craftier than simple solutions would suggestion
01:28:38 <strcat[m]> but blocking everything 'bad' and not needed for the site to work
01:28:40 <strcat[m]> doesn't stop tracking
01:29:16 <strcat[m]> you are still tracked by the site itself, and stuff you have to whitelist for it to work, although that isn't needed for tracking at all, all that's needed is the first party
01:29:38 <strcat[m]> and ofc nothing stops them sharing that data with others and they can and do run third party middleware
01:29:43 <cn3m[m]> the much better solution is to run webapps
01:29:44 <strcat[m]> which adds stuff and sends off data
01:30:10 <cn3m[m]> you will still be spied on, but it will be better restricted
01:30:20 <strcat[m]> and btw lets say you do block some third party connection for an app
01:30:24 <strcat[m]> ok, you caused an exception
01:30:31 <strcat[m]> but you allow connections to their server?
01:30:42 <strcat[m]> their SDK for tracking crashes is going to send a report because of what you blocked
01:30:52 <strcat[m]> you put yourself in a crash db
01:31:10 <strcat[m]> database of info dumps from when exceptions are thrown
01:31:18 <cn3m[m]> apps can see your real ip worth noting
01:31:22 <strcat[m]> you made yourself stand out to the point that an actual person may look at your data
01:32:13 <strcat[m]> it makes sense to have a Network toggle at least if other stuff enforces it
01:32:42 <strcat[m]> it makes a lot less sense to pretend fine-grained filtering works as people seem to expect
01:33:02 <strcat[m]> esp, since other stuff is not going to enforce that
01:33:24 <strcat[m]> it's a lot to ask that some random browser you install enforces the INTERNET permission on other apps
01:33:27 <qevven[m]> 1 person reviewing a debug log is better than 100 marketing companies targeting ads to you
01:33:40 <strcat[m]> qevven: data can still go to the marketing company
01:33:50 <strcat[m]> all you blocked is sending it from the client without going through their server
01:33:54 <strcat[m]> and as I said earlier
01:34:04 <strcat[m]> if it goes through the client that means the API key is the client
01:34:17 <strcat[m]> which is considered a bad practice because anyone can extract the API key and use it the same way
01:34:41 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "1 person reviewing a debug log i"> you might find just not having an ad id breaks 90% of practical targeting anyway
01:34:49 <cn3m[m]> qevven: https://grapheneos.org/faq#non-hardware-identifiers
01:35:23 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is strongly opposed to privacy/security theater
01:36:16 <cn3m[m]> I have no ad id and I use privatedns to block well known trackers that aren't trying. Extremely easy setup and just as effective as a more convoluted method
01:36:20 <strcat[m]> we don't do stuff like blocking one of many ways to do something equivalent and making that seem meaningful
01:36:25 <qevven[m]> I just don‚Äôt understand how choosing to minimise footprint is privacy theatre
01:36:55 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "I just don‚Äôt understand how choo"> you're not doing it with the methods you suggest
01:36:59 <strcat[m]> qevven: it doesn't minimize your footprint, it makes you stand out
01:37:38 <madaidan[m]> qevven: do you happen to browser r/privacy?
01:37:43 <qevven[m]> Same can be said about Tor users
01:37:45 <madaidan[m]>  * qevven: do you happen to browse r/privacy?
01:37:52 <cn3m[m]> they add more risk
01:38:03 <cn3m[m]> privatedns is a better setup than using a VPN app
01:38:06 <strcat[m]> qevven: yes Tor users stand out to the local network, their ISP, and the traffic from exit nodes is super interesting
01:38:30 <strcat[m]> qevven: but all the local network / ISP see is you are using Tor
01:38:51 <strcat[m]> unless there is very coordinated  monitoring
01:39:11 <qevven[m]> Ok I shall educate myself better on these subjects üôÉ
01:39:16 <strcat[m]> that is something to consider when using Tor
01:39:23 <cn3m[m]> encrypted dns in general doesn't help against ISP tracking
01:39:26 <cn3m[m]> it only makes things worse
01:39:29 <strcat[m]> like if you are in a repressive country
01:39:32 <cn3m[m]> poor comparison
01:39:37 <strcat[m]> maybe simply using Tor is enough to get arrested / tortured
01:39:38 <strcat[m]> so...
01:40:16 <madaidan[m]> There's Tor bridges/pluggable transports but I wouldn't bet my life on them
01:40:41 <strcat[m]> also worth noting the Tor Browser approach
01:40:47 <analog[m]> It's pretty much impossible to completely hide Tor usage from your iSP afaik.
01:40:57 <strcat[m]> is attempting to provide real privacy via anonymity
01:41:01 <cn3m[m]> vpn is a better in that use case as plausible deniability is much higher
01:41:08 <cn3m[m]> you don't stand out and it is beyond some repressive countries ability to monitor
01:41:12 <strcat[m]> there are 3 parts to this
01:41:32 <strcat[m]> traffic needs to go through something like Tor or a VPN where sites, etc. don't identify you simply by IP, etc.
01:41:50 <strcat[m]> the site needs to be compartmentalized
01:42:03 <strcat[m]> all the state and so on
01:42:04 <strcat[m]> HTTP connection pools, cache, cookies, everything
01:42:07 <strcat[m]> tons of stuff for browsers
01:42:19 <strcat[m]> and then there is the issue of fingerprinting
01:42:38 <strcat[m]> including through side channels like performance
01:43:09 <strcat[m]> the Tor Browser attempts to address these things - it is the closest thing to providing it, although it is very flawed
01:43:19 <strcat[m]> but really
01:43:42 <strcat[m]> all those privacy extensions and things are mostly just privacy theater nonsense and don't stop you being tracked + make you stand out a lot, especially as you change more settings and use more extensions
01:43:47 <strcat[m]> and set up the extensions in unique ways
01:43:51 <madaidan[m]> There's also the need to not be hacked easily which TB doesn't provide
01:43:58 <strcat[m]> specific ad-blocking subscriptions, specific versions of them and so on
01:44:41 <strcat[m]> pretty trivial to try connecting to a list of URLs and use that to check which ad-blocking subs are enabled - that's the type of thing fingerprinting is built on
01:44:49 <strcat[m]> the unique configuration, extensions, state in those extensions, etc.
01:44:50 <strcat[m]> for that user
01:44:57 <strcat[m]> also extensions are shared state between sites
01:45:11 <strcat[m]> in many cases they break this kind of compartmentalization
01:45:19 <strcat[m]> even if the browser does it
01:45:30 <strcat[m]> similarly they can and do break stuff like an incognito mode
01:46:00 <strcat[m]> cause they have their own state and they largely don't respect isolation between sites or stuff like an ephemeral state mode
01:47:05 <strcat[m]> Tor Browser doesn't have an ad-blocking extensions because of the extra bits of fingerprinting it'd provide, and because it's providing a real approach to privacy
01:47:17 <strcat[m]>  * Tor Browser doesn't have an ad-blocking extension because of the extra bits of fingerprinting it'd provide, and because it's providing a real approach to privacy
01:47:40 <strcat[m]> if it did provide ad-blocking, it'd be important to not have configuration and for it to just be on/off (1 bit) with no dynamic updates
01:47:43 <strcat[m]> of filters
01:47:54 <madaidan[m]> Tails is stupid and adds one though
01:48:12 <strcat[m]> I think most users of the Tor Browser don't really get how it works and do lots of things to ruin it anyways
01:48:17 <strcat[m]> plus there are a lot of flaws / holes in this
01:48:27 <strcat[m]> but it is the only VIABLE approach to providing real privacy
01:48:33 <strcat[m]> enumerating badness is not
01:50:01 <strcat[m]> content filtering is like antivirus except with hands tied behind their back
01:50:17 <strcat[m]> well
01:50:19 <strcat[m]> it's not different
01:50:23 <strcat[m]> it is the same thing
01:50:49 <strcat[m]> AVs tried moving to heuristics and more complex ways of doing signatures but it doesn't really change much
01:50:57 <strcat[m]> you can try doing that with a browser extension too
01:51:10 <strcat[m]> but really when you can't do anything about the first party site
01:51:27 <strcat[m]> aside from outright disallowing a user to use say twitter.com or wikipedia.com or nytimes.com cause they track you
01:51:37 <strcat[m]> and like
01:51:41 <strcat[m]> disallow every site hosted via Cloudflare?
01:51:44 <strcat[m]> or using AWS?
01:51:56 <strcat[m]> any site not committing to not tracking users and selling the data themselves?
01:52:07 <strcat[m]> and just rely on them keeping that promise?
01:52:12 <strcat[m]> how exactly is this supposed to work? shrug
01:53:44 <cn3m[m]> reminds me of the ethical ad blocker
01:53:46 <cn3m[m]> only lets you connect to sites that are completely donation supported or sponsored
01:53:57 <strcat[m]> https://www.qubes-os.org/ is GitHub (Microsoft)
01:54:05 <strcat[m]> so yeah you can block the third party connections to google
01:54:06 <strcat[m]> in the client
01:54:23 <strcat[m]> but how are you going to stop Microsoft from knowing you visited it if your privacy relies on blocking third party stuff
01:55:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> it's a long shot, but has anyone here got a link to that video of several doctors in a zoom meeting talking about most of the covid19 deaths actually being unrelated to the virus? I know there are a lot of hardcore anti-censorship types lurking
01:55:41 <qevven[m]> I have a few links but you need to search for the exact video
01:56:54 <cn3m[m]> strcat: excellent points
01:57:02 <strcat[m]> gitlab.com
01:57:03 <strcat[m]> cloudflare
01:57:03 <cn3m[m]> privacy on the web is so misunderstood
01:57:17 <strcat[m]> I mean half the web uses either aws or cloudflare
01:57:20 <strcat[m]> for the 'first party'
01:57:25 <strcat[m]> or both
01:57:49 <strcat[m]> visit gitlab.com with 0 third party stuff allowed -> you are connecting via cloudflare
01:58:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> qevven: In general, I'd appreciate it if you'd point me toward anything that's useful for locating info that's been censored by search engines and social media. If you've got a lion
01:58:04 <strcat[m]> and they are using some host behind cloudflare
01:58:06 <strcat[m]> probably something like azure or aws
01:58:08 <cyborgninjaneer[> link* please throw it over.
01:58:34 <strcat[m]> you can disable 100% of non-first-party web resources
01:58:53 <strcat[m]> and even if the sites themselves like gitlab didn't track you
01:59:01 <strcat[m]> the hosting they use can
01:59:12 <strcat[m]> and ofc they can sell / share all the data amongst each other
01:59:19 <strcat[m]> they really do not need your web browsing client to do that for them
01:59:21 <strcat[m]> they can do it on their end
01:59:25 <JTL> ^
01:59:26 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "visit gitlab.com with 0 third pa"> this is the hilariousness of it all
01:59:31 <strcat[m]> like how facebook shares data with tons of companies
01:59:31 <JTL> Agreed
01:59:49 <strcat[m]> they didn't put the cambridge analytica stuff into your web browser, they gave them the data themselves
02:00:07 <cn3m[m]> I tried to be active on reddit, but whenever I say stuff like this they say "use hardened firefox and they downvote to oblivion"
02:00:37 <strcat[m]> I don't understand how enumerating badness is supposed to stop pervasive tracking
02:00:45 <strcat[m]> and a lot of people that know better just ignore all this
02:00:54 <strcat[m]> cause their job / projects depends on pretending not to know better
02:00:55 <cn3m[m]> it's pointless
02:01:05 <cn3m[m]> the privacy theater feel good stuff is too potent
02:01:26 <JTL> > 18:59 <strcat[m]> they didn't put the cambridge analytica stuff into your web browser, they gave them the data themselves
02:01:28 <JTL> no shit lol
02:01:35 <strcat[m]> 99% of security stuff is a scam, 99.9% of privacy stuff
02:01:46 <JTL> Makes me sad
02:02:25 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cause their job / projects depen"> exactly if I make an adblocker and I say btw this is useless then people will say oh I will find another adblocker
02:02:41 <qevven[m]> I‚Äôm more woke now then I was 30 minutes ago üòÆ
02:02:49 <cn3m[m]> imagine if gorhill said adblocking was privacy theater. uBlock would be dead and nanoblocker would be the hot new thing since nanoblocker "works"
02:04:06 <strcat[m]> the goal of GrapheneOS is to be less bad and provide real privacy and security improvements
02:04:11 <strcat[m]> and to be honest about what it does and doesn't do
02:04:31 <strcat[m]> and try to make things better overall and push things in the right direction
02:05:12 <strcat[m]> unfortunately when I talk about these things - and I am saying things that are accurate, factual, truthful and well informed - some people get super offended
02:05:21 <strcat[m]> and go try waging some war against myself and the project
02:05:27 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "and to be honest about what it d"> why I appreciate this project it is not all about rooted bullshit like xprivacy
02:05:30 <cn3m[m]> that just makes me roll my eyes. client side checks my ass
02:05:43 <strcat[m]> cause they don't like hearing that you need to take an approach dealing with the origin tracking you
02:05:50 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "imagine if gorhill said adblocki"> Not everyone uses uBlock for privacy though
02:06:05 <strcat[m]> I use ad-blocking because fuck ads, not because I think it gives me more privacy
02:06:22 <qevven[m]> Ok I‚Äôm going to attempt to install Graphene OS let‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt brick my pixel lol
02:06:34 <strcat[m]> sure blocking a bunch of stuff opportunistically helps a little bit but it's not a real fundamental privacy feature
02:06:42 <strcat[m]> it's just some opportunistic removal of low hanging fruit
02:06:57 <strcat[m]> and ppl largely worry about the wrong things anyways
02:07:09 <strcat[m]> lets say that Cloudflare was evil, as a hypothetical
02:07:17 <strcat[m]> lets say Cloudflare is like some James Bond villain company
02:07:26 <strcat[m]> they literally see half your web traffic decrypted
02:07:29 <strcat[m]> going both ways
02:07:46 <strcat[m]> amazon prob like 80%
02:07:46 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "and ppl largely worry about the "> Like they believe the ME is a bigger threat than the lack of OS security
02:07:46 <strcat[m]> lol
02:08:37 <cn3m[m]> root certs what are those? I can see your traffic
02:11:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> qevven: I couldn't decrypt any of your private messages. Try the room I just invited you to.
02:11:44 <cn3m[m]> I use Debian and Firefox(sandoxed with firejail) with a device with no firmware signing or microcode /s
02:11:55 <strcat[m]> and also web browsers want you to feel all warm and happy about web security but web security is based on 1500 different trusted parties being responsible for checking DNS (without being required to check DNSSEC) and all being able to issue certs for any domain
02:12:15 <madaidan[m]> I hate firejail
02:12:28 <cn3m[m]> <madaidan[m] "I hate firejail"> and I love you for that
02:12:36 <madaidan[m]> One of the devs even tried to spread FUD about bubblewrap when I pointed out its superiority
02:12:46 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "and also web browsers want you t"> do people even research the tech they use and how it works?
02:12:52 <cn3m[m]> this seems very basic too me
02:13:09 <strcat[m]> I think ppl may not realize
02:13:23 <strcat[m]> that if I can do a MITM in front of a web site's authoritative DNS server
02:13:35 <strcat[m]> if can obtain a valid DV cert trivially
02:13:39 <strcat[m]> for that site
02:13:54 <strcat[m]> and host valid HTTPS connections to it via my server
02:13:56 <cn3m[m]> no shit
02:14:02 <strcat[m]> also it's not even just DNS
02:14:08 <cn3m[m]> root of trust
02:14:10 <strcat[m]> DV is allowed to trust DNS + SMTP + HTTP
02:14:15 <cn3m[m]> keyword trust
02:14:21 <strcat[m]> unencrypted email and HTTP is a valid way to prove domain control to get DV cert
02:14:42 * TheJollyRoger-M starts breaking out in a cold sweat.
02:14:51 <strcat[m]> OV / EV just means they run some check to see it's a valid business and they put the name in
02:14:54 <strcat[m]> and that's pretty useless
02:15:00 <strcat[m]> and not shown by browsers anymore anyways
02:15:15 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "unencrypted email and HTTP is a "> didn't that happen semi recently like within the past decade
02:15:18 <cn3m[m]> maybe to google or something
02:15:48 <strcat[m]> really the only way to get a DV certificate should be DNS validated by DNSSEC and either get info from there or chain to an HTTPS server with pub key in DNS or w/e...
02:15:52 <strcat[m]> but that is not how it works at all
02:16:19 <cn3m[m]> I talked to a guy who didn't think it would be a problem with an adversary controlled every root cert since he could simply use i2p
02:16:21 <strcat[m]> a common issue is sites allow email registration and you can sometimes register one of the emails that's considered an admin email and allowed to issue certs
02:16:26 <cn3m[m]> I never facepalmed
02:16:32 <strcat[m]> and btw this is just unencrypted email
02:16:35 <strcat[m]> normal email
02:16:43 <cn3m[m]>  * I never facepalmed so hard
02:16:50 <strcat[m]> they are not required to check DNSSEC or DANE
02:16:54 <strcat[m]> and the http way s just http
02:16:57 <strcat[m]> not https
02:17:55 <strcat[m]> there was HPKP which let you do pinning for trust-on-first-use
02:18:01 <strcat[m]> chromium/firefox both removed it
02:18:12 <strcat[m]> neither supports DNSSEC/DANE either
02:19:07 <strcat[m]> chromium at least requires certs to be issued with Certificate Transparency so they are all logged
02:19:20 <strcat[m]> so for example I monitor logs for grapheneos domains
02:19:31 <strcat[m]> firefox doesn't enforce that certs are logged
02:19:48 <strcat[m]> anyways that's just a reactive measure
02:19:56 <cn3m[m]> sometime I feel like writing a whole long post about the true root of trusts in computing(especially networking), but I feel like I would lose my mind trying to handle the people making up crap
02:20:00 <strcat[m]> i.e. site has to notice it happened and then do 'something'
02:20:16 <strcat[m]> like go whine to the CA and try to get them to revoke it
02:20:22 <strcat[m]> but revocation doesn't work
02:20:28 <strcat[m]> and is cached for like 14 days
02:20:42 <TheJollyRoger-M> Oh man.
02:20:45 <strcat[m]> chromium has a system to distribute a subset of revocations quickly
02:20:53 <strcat[m]> but they can't do all, they have to choose which to do
02:20:58 <strcat[m]> CRTSets
02:21:18 <renlord> cert transparency is meant to facilitate complaints
02:21:19 <renlord> kek
02:21:33 <cn3m[m]> I still chuckle whenever I remember Firefox was Germany's more secure browser for HTTPS reaons
02:21:36 <cn3m[m]> excellent research /s
02:21:39 <strcat[m]> the standard revocation thing is OCSP
02:21:40 <renlord> should start a autoCAcomplain.com
02:21:41 <TheJollyRoger-M> <madaidan[m] "Like they believe the ME is a bi"> Oh man. Too soon man, too soon aaaaargh...
02:21:45 <strcat[m]> you ask a CA server if the cert is revoked
02:21:47 * TheJollyRoger-M drowns his sorrows.
02:21:51 <strcat[m]> and that's horrible cause
02:21:53 <strcat[m]> they go down
02:22:01 <strcat[m]> and it leaks every site you visit to CA if we really did that
02:22:04 <strcat[m]> browsers had to do soft fail
02:22:08 <strcat[m]> if connection failed just allow
02:22:12 <strcat[m]> so that's basically dead
02:22:41 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "I still chuckle whenever I remem"> Governments are so incompetent sometimes
02:22:41 <strcat[m]> instead of there is OCSP stapling
02:22:42 <strcat[m]> this feature is broken in both apache and nginx
02:22:53 <strcat[m]> and they still can be cached for like 14 days
02:23:06 <strcat[m]> so attacker can get one when they compromise it and it's valid for 14 days
02:23:16 <strcat[m]> browser will accept that proof it is not revoked
02:23:28 <strcat[m]> and anyway this assumes you set up something that is totally broken in both apache and nginx
02:23:43 <strcat[m]> it is only really usable in a non-broken way with nginx using a third party script and pointing nginx at the result
02:23:50 <strcat[m]> apache can't
02:23:57 <strcat[m]> and set Must-Staple
02:24:13 <strcat[m]> and that only allows you to properly revoke your OWN certs with that caveat of the revocation proofs being valid for 7-14 days or w/e
02:24:31 <strcat[m]> assuming CA provides you a way to revoke sanely
02:24:42 <strcat[m]> I remember startssl used to refuse to revoke certs
02:24:58 <strcat[m]> you had to pay to get revocation
02:25:23 <strcat[m]> ofc
02:25:25 <renlord> strcat[m]: isnt that the definition of ransomware?
02:25:36 <strcat[m]> shrug
02:25:42 <strcat[m]> anyway this is the tip of the iceberg
02:26:00 <strcat[m]> obviously web browsers aren't going to tell you how horribly fucked beyond repair everything they've done is
02:26:05 <renlord> legalised ransomware
02:26:07 <renlord> lol
02:26:19 * TheJollyRoger-M cries into his beer so much the cup overflows and starts puddling onto the floor.
02:26:22 <cn3m[m]> on that note do you use gmail for related security reasons?
02:26:24 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "I remember startssl used to refu"> I forgot about that oh boy
02:26:41 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I try not to use email
02:26:45 <TheJollyRoger-M> Yeah even after the Debian Weak Keys disaster!
02:26:54 <strcat[m]> my gmail account is basically a way to collect 250+ emails in the spam folder daily
02:27:09 <strcat[m]> email is super fucked beyond repair too
02:27:32 <strcat[m]> I have seen that now after spending tons of time figuring out how to host an email server properly in a way that's as secure as possible
02:27:54 <strcat[m]> ruined by the fact that 99% of other people's email servers are totally insecure
02:27:55 <strcat[m]> so only 1% of the email exchanges are at all secure
02:28:19 <TheJollyRoger-M> Oh god.
02:29:18 <cn3m[m]> in all seriousness why host your own email?
02:29:30 <strcat[m]> cn3m: because I need an email server for grapheneos.org etc
02:29:49 <TheJollyRoger-M> Yeah for sending out the attestation alerts and such.
02:29:52 <strcat[m]> attestation.app needs to send people alert emails and I need to be able to receive emails
02:30:16 <strcat[m]> and there is no provider that offers the security I set up for it even if I wanted to trust them
02:30:38 <strcat[m]> well no major one
02:30:57 <cn3m[m]> fair enough
02:31:02 <cn3m[m]> a lot of people would probably be uncomfortable with you outsourcing that to Google or Microsoft?
02:31:04 <strcat[m]> cn3m: other people don't do stuff right, basically, instead I had to invest substantial time in this and I feel it was useful
02:31:17 <strcat[m]> neither Google or Microsoft supports DANE only MTA-STS
02:31:28 <strcat[m]> most providers don't have authenticated TLS at all so...
02:31:31 <strcat[m]> that's better than most
02:32:12 <strcat[m]> you need both MTA-STS and DANE really to provide TLS authentication for people doing either
02:32:18 <strcat[m]> most people do neither one tho
02:32:41 <strcat[m]> anyways email is really fucked even when set up totally properly
02:33:14 <strcat[m]> also a lot of people are anti-email-security and don't like the features used to prevent spoofing emails, etc.
02:33:27 <strcat[m]> so they actively work to keep it insecure
02:33:46 <strcat[m]> cough linux kernel devs
02:35:28 <madaidan[m]> I'd never want to deal with those people ever
02:35:32 <madaidan[m]> They sound like a nightmare
02:35:50 <madaidan[m]> Getting changes accepted downstream sounds far nicer
02:36:43 <strcat[m]> mailing lists historically have liked to edit your emails
02:36:50 <strcat[m]> stick info at the bottom about the mailing list
02:36:54 <strcat[m]> and leave it as your FROM address
02:37:54 <strcat[m]> so, ofc they don't have valid SPF since they send an email on your behalf to everyone - SPF doesn't really work alone, no one can enforce it
02:38:03 <strcat[m]> and they modified the email so the DKIM signature is invalid
02:38:11 <strcat[m]> DMARC requires either SPF or DKIM to be valid
02:38:38 <strcat[m]> there is a header you can put on emails (and you can add headers to emails that are DKIM signed - it only signs specific headers the mail server lists)
02:38:57 <strcat[m]> for doing list unsubscribe
02:39:01 <strcat[m]> but they are super backwards and refuse to do this basically
02:39:40 <strcat[m]> so people using domains where email spoofing is prevented can't use lots of mailing lists, lol, the spoofed emails from the mailing list are rejected by secure providers enforcing DMARC
02:40:04 * JTL is still sad that any form of pinning is gone from browsers
02:40:05 <JTL> lol
02:40:08 <strcat[m]> and instead of just not modifying people's emails a lot of the mailing list software instead decided to rewrite your FROM address
02:40:15 <strcat[m]> to their own domain

02:54:26 <madaidan[m]> Use Arch btw
02:54:31 <strcat[m]> qevven: https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-signify
02:54:42 <strcat[m]> > If you do not have a way to obtain signify from a package repository you're already trusting, it does not make sense to use it. GrapheneOS releases are hosted on our servers and we do not have third party mirrors. A compromised signify would be able to compromise your OS and the GrapheneOS download due to the lack of an application security model on traditional operating systems. It would be worse than not trying to
02:54:42 <strcat[m]> verify the signatures. It's far less likely that our servers would be compromised than someone's GitHub account or GitHub itself. You're already trusting these installation instructions from our site, which is hosted on the same static web server infrastructure as the releases.
02:54:52 <strcat[m]> qevven: the whole point of signify is chaining trust from your distro repos
02:55:11 <strcat[m]> if it doesn't provide it, no point, you'd just be installing signify without verifying it a sig for it anyway right?
02:55:44 <qevven[m]> Ok I‚Äôll skip that step
02:55:45 <strcat[m]> ideally every distro would provide working fastboot and signify
02:56:51 <strcat[m]> I considered adding a signature that certutil on windows could verify

02:56:58 <strcat[m]> it's really a pain
02:57:11 <qevven[m]> No worries
02:57:32 <strcat[m]> issue is the tool to verify has to be built into the OS or in trusted repos
02:57:51 <strcat[m]> and GPG is too screwed up + not in Windows anyways

04:23:16 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> hello, i am seeing connections from my pixel 3 that are leaking outside my VPN to epdg.epc.mncXYZ.mccABC.pub.3gppnetwork.org
04:23:16 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> can anyone suggest how i prevent this connection?
04:46:16 <nickcalyx[m]> turn off wifi calling
04:47:30 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> i have no wifi calling enabled / option
04:49:08 <nickcalyx[m]> well I'm pretty sure that's what it has to do with
04:50:27 <qevven[m]> Does installing aurora store defeat the purpose of using grapheneos?
04:50:27 <nickcalyx[m]> step 1) hit the phone icon as if you are going to make a call step 2) hit the 3 dot icon in the upper right corner, near "search contacts" and select 'settings'
04:50:40 <nickcalyx[m]> step 3) hit 'Calls'
04:50:58 <nickcalyx[m]> then you can select 'Wifi calling' .. what is it set to now
04:51:08 <qevven[m]> Or installing the original pixel camera apk
05:12:01 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "then you can select 'Wifi callin"> there is no 'wifi calling' option, even in submenu
05:13:01 <nickcalyx[m]> if you go to 'about' what does it say the build version is
05:13:33 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "if you go to 'about' what does i"> 'about' in calls? build version 23.0
05:13:55 <nickcalyx[m]> hm, well I am stumped then. :)
05:14:07 <nickcalyx[m]> that's the same version as me but I am not running graphene
05:14:34 <nickcalyx[m]> however if you google about 3gppnetwork.org it's something the carriers use to implement wifi calling
05:14:37 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> me too! internet research says the 3gpp network is about WiFi calling - but i can't find it on my phone
05:15:03 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> i'm on the latest stable build of grapheneOS
05:15:23 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> - the other question is how this is bypassing the VPN
05:16:56 <x26h9x2rxm[m]> if WiFi calling is a system app, can i revoke the network permission?
05:22:08 <nickcalyx[m]> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

06:11:28 <cn3m[m]> yeah relocking is one thing being built with verified boot keys is another I'll check it
06:11:30 <cn3m[m]> if Official Lineage doesn't have verified boot on OP3-6 that's what I'm talking about
06:12:22 <lvkm[m]> qevven: foss apps from fdroid are best but for exceptions i use aurora store in a separate work profile (via shelter).
06:18:32 <qevven[m]> lvkm: so you put Aurora Store in separate profile and install apps in shelter ?
06:25:20 <qevven[m]> Shelter isn‚Äôt working for me won‚Äôt install or clone into work profile
06:28:03 <lvkm[m]> uninstall shelter and fdroid, aurora, reboot and install them again. once you have work profile active, go into shelter and clone aurora
06:28:58 <lvkm[m]> then you can uninstall aurora from main profile
06:29:35 <qevven[m]> Ok I‚Äôll try, is Shelter still maintained? Looks like dev is no longer maintaining
06:33:48 <lvkm[m]> i guess so. ideally you should have multiple users, and don't add another trust point with an obscure app, but switching is a bit of a pain in the ass.
06:35:11 <qevven[m]> Oh I see now, I rebooted and all is working fine now
06:35:34 <qevven[m]> This is cool
06:35:52 <qevven[m]> Thank you for the tip
06:37:19 <qevven[m]> lvkm: would you recommend keeping 2FA apps such as Bitwarden, Yubico, Authy in Main or Work profile?
06:39:02 <lvkm[m]> you're welcome. i would probably end up ditching work profiles and use users. i already have a different one for finacial apps, shopping and tech stuff.
06:41:11 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "lvkm: would you recommend keepin"> main profile
06:41:22 <lvkm[m]> i have keepassdx installed on each user and keep my database and key file on a type c usb stick.
06:41:57 <lvkm[m]> krepassdx also supports 2fa
06:43:31 <lvkm[m]> that way credentials are available on every user as there is no share storage between them
06:44:51 <qevven[m]> Changing users is a pain no? If you shopping as one user and you won‚Äôt know if you get a text or call as another user, or does text and calls all still the same for all users?
06:49:17 * qevven[m] uploaded an image: ima_8854c99.jpeg (52KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PMCUZvQiuOfYBfrkUvioprdD >
06:49:24 <qevven[m]> Should both be enabled or no?
06:49:28 <lvkm[m]> keepassdx also saves the location so when i want to log in i just plug the stick, switch to the custom keyboard, tap the fingerprint scanner and I'm in. calls pass through but if the name is not in contacts it just shows the number. sms i didn't test
06:50:08 <lvkm[m]> same, probably a bug
06:51:58 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "Should both be enabled or no?"> work only
06:52:06 <cn3m[m]> device admin is a dangerous permission
06:52:07 <cn3m[m]> that is work profile is considered partially untrusted
06:52:11 <lvkm[m]> other comunication apps would need to be installed on each profile to not miss notifications
06:53:50 <qevven[m]> As of now there is no google notifications alternative correct? Just microg as a proxy but microg doesn‚Äôt work for Graphene
06:53:55 <lvkm[m]> * other comunication apps would need to be installed on each user to not miss notifications
06:55:11 <qevven[m]> Or do notifications work fine in Graphene?
06:56:53 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "As of now there is no google not"> microg needs to be rebuilt before it will be added
06:56:54 <lvkm[m]> unlimited "work" profiles without third party apps would be nice to have. notification work fine for the most part even without google services. some apps need to keep a persistent notification at all times for that tho.
06:57:00 <cn3m[m]> anyone is free to work on breaking it down
07:00:52 <lvkm[m]> once scoped storage is implemented in android 11 would it make sense to still use profiles? graphne has already a robust permission toggles system, any app could be kept in check by that.

07:06:43 <lvkm[m]> i have a special user just for that.
07:10:06 <qevven[m]> So you have to log out and in everytime you want to do different activities?
07:11:21 <lvkm[m]> yes
07:11:47 <cg_droid> qevven[m], you only change the user in the same place as you have the icons Airplane mode, etc
07:11:59 <cg_droid> qevven[m], you only change the user in the same place where you have the icons Airplane mode, etc
07:12:26 <lvkm[m]> most of the time the apps remain open when switching profiles. i guess is a ram thing
07:14:16 <lvkm[m]> as cg is saying is easy to just swipe notification down and tap on the user icon
07:14:47 <lvkm[m]> less convenient than work profiles but more secure
07:17:04 <qevven[m]> I see, I‚Äôve used android many years & custom roms but never bothered using profiles or multiple users üòÖ trying to ditch my iPhone for GrapheneOS, since tracing tools are being pushed into latest updates

07:35:48 <cn3m[m]> If you want any protection from the government you would use a hardened system like iPad, GrapheneOS, Windows 10 to slow down exploit development. Toggles work, they are verified all the time by advanced network monitoring
07:36:19 <cn3m[m]> There is no protecting from people with so much control over the root of trust over the web
07:37:23 <cg_droid> cn3m[m]: how do you know that?, source?
07:37:29 <cn3m[m]> they don't need backdoors or exploits(even though they could easily exploit). If the US government is in your threat model and you believe they will violate the law like never before you have to go offline. Windows 10 and macOS aren't data mining you. Turn off the clear opt outs

07:51:10 <cn3m[m]> <JTL "Be curious to see that :)"> You would do best to do it yourself if you're skeptical
07:51:16 <cn3m[m]> I could do it again and show you, but it not really a simple thing to show
07:51:43 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "Do you know if Edge is degoogled"> Edge with the privacy settings changed is reasonable, it doesn't have much in the way of Google
07:51:53 <JTL> cn3m[m]: Okay fair enough
07:52:07 <JTL> Was just curious if you had results written up or something
07:52:25 * lvkm[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PTwCAfvTYpGgYEIdOABamhOs >
07:52:46 <cg_droid> cn3m[m]: is only Chromium with minimal changes?
07:52:53 <lvkm[m]> citations from the officiall release
07:53:09 <lvkm[m]> * citations from the official release
07:55:11 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "cn3m: is only Chromium with mini"> It adds tracking protection and some minor tweaks
07:55:41 <cg_droid> cn3m[m]: thanls
07:55:46 <cg_droid> cn3m[m]: thanks
07:55:48 <cn3m[m]> It doesn't have Chrome's best in class differential privacy telemetry, but I recommend not using any browser with telemety
07:57:28 <cn3m[m]>  @nwiddkd:matrix.org don't install the one app allowed on the store for your country and don't opt into it
07:57:32 <cn3m[m]> it's pretty simple
07:58:31 <cn3m[m]> it's like complaining that there's location services on GrapheneOS, but having to install Google's manager and opting into letting it access the system
07:58:41 <cg_droid> > cg_droid: Google is a Linux security partner
07:58:41 <cg_droid> > that data contains kernel vulns
07:58:41 <cg_droid> It soumds Google is like a trojan horse to the linux community then lol
07:58:49 <cn3m[m]> that would be insane to say that, but people like to be edgy and complain about contact tracing
07:58:58 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "It soumds Google is like a troja"> that's false
07:59:08 <cn3m[m]> Linux partners with everyone too
07:59:13 <qevven[m]> I feel there‚Äôs a very naive perception of big corporations & government in here, I don‚Äôt think GrapheneOS is for me, gonna give SailfishOS a try ‚úåÔ∏è
07:59:21 <cn3m[m]> I am going with the sources I have on my desktop bookmarks
07:59:22 <cn3m[m]> there's more on my phone

07:59:52 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "I feel there‚Äôs a very naive perc"> What am I wrong on
08:00:01 <cn3m[m]> point to one thing
08:00:34 <cg_droid> > I feel there‚Äôs a very naive perception of big corporations & government in here, I don‚Äôt think GrapheneOS is for me, gonna give SailfishOS a try ‚úåÔ∏è
08:00:34 <cg_droid> Bad decision, really..
08:00:49 <cn3m[m]> there's a lot worse things you could lose your privacy too by downloading an app and opting into an OS feature
08:00:54 <cg_droid> > I feel there‚Äôs a very naive perception of big corporations & government in here, I don‚Äôt think GrapheneOS is for me, gonna give SailfishOS a try ‚úåÔ∏è
08:00:54 <cg_droid> Bad choice, really..
08:01:26 <qevven[m]> You guys realise when Edward snowden quotes Graphene os he is being paid by the Russian gov to say certain things just like Julian Assange
08:01:34 <cn3m[m]> Accessibility settings is that easy to opt in and get malware controlling your device
08:01:35 <cn3m[m]> people don't freak out about that
08:01:52 <cn3m[m]> Sailfish is terrible
08:02:19 <qevven[m]> I‚Äôm just gonna use a beeper üìü instead lol
08:02:19 <cn3m[m]> <qevven[m] "You guys realise when Edward sno"> you're spreading FUD
08:02:20 <cn3m[m]> that's bullshit
08:02:30 <cn3m[m]> It's open source
08:02:33 <cn3m[m]> build it yourself
08:03:21 <cg_droid> > You guys realise when Edward snowden quotes Graphene os he is being paid by the Russian gov to say certain things just like Julian Assange
08:03:21 <cg_droid> You don't get Google apps or services in GOS and you get a network permission and many security features
08:03:48 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS is all open source build it yourself
08:03:50 <cn3m[m]> well we'll
08:03:53 <cg_droid> Check the code, it' s free
08:03:59 <cn3m[m]>  * well well
08:06:13 <cn3m[m]> he never gave a source on Windows spying when opting out haha
08:06:13 <cn3m[m]> he never gave a source on Windows spying when opting out haha
08:08:00 <cn3m[m]> The funny thing is the Russians couldn't effect a Canadian project that's downstream from an  American project. There's zero reason for them to do that. Lack of critical thinking
08:09:55 <cg_droid> cn3m[m]: and why also sending the vulns to China?, it doesn't sound to be true... Usa and China are enemies
08:11:08 <cg_droid> Maybe that sentemce is not true, can we trust only in it?
08:11:14 <cg_droid> Maybe that sentence is not true, can we trust only in it?
08:11:55 <cg_droid> It's weak
08:16:16 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_cg_droid:matrix.org I mean countless Chinese OEMs get it
08:16:22 <cn3m[m]> they have to share it and China might be maintaining their own fork they need patches for
08:16:39 <cn3m[m]> many unsurprisingly ways they could get it
08:17:50 <cg_droid> Ok
08:18:06 <cn3m[m]> Security teams are not unique to Google and Linux or even just open source
08:18:08 <cn3m[m]> pre sharing vulnerability patch code is a fact of life
08:20:19 <cn3m[m]> anything that's an open or closed source project that's likely to have major forks(public or private), military, or government partnerships are all sharing
08:20:39 <cn3m[m]> it's simply impossible to coordinate patches that well
08:20:45 <cn3m[m]> look how badly most Android vendors screw it up
08:21:01 <JTL> Samsung has been known to leak updates before the public release date
08:21:01 <cg_droid> Well, I suppose there also many Chinese developers in there
08:21:02 <JTL> lol
08:21:10 <cg_droid> Well, I suppose there are also many Chinese developers in there
08:21:16 <cn3m[m]> lazy governments with their fork of Firefox could take a very long time without that help
08:21:25 <cn3m[m]> <JTL "Samsung has been known to leak u"> OnePlus more maliciously though
08:21:43 <cn3m[m]> Samsung is a beta or something from all I've seen
08:21:51 <JTL> I don't the specifics, but that doesn't surprise me
08:21:59 <cn3m[m]> which is more likely to be an accident
08:22:15 <cn3m[m]> OnePlus tries to market their devices as more secure than Pixels by this abuse
08:22:33 <JTL> Jesus
08:22:52 <cn3m[m]> they are almost the least secure device down with the barely named brands
08:23:37 <cn3m[m]> Google is the only good Android. Samsung and Motorola have barely passable security models about half the time
08:25:14 <cg_droid> So, are you saying that almost all systems out there are giving sensible info/vulnerabilities to the governments?
08:25:29 <cg_droid> Is it something they can't avoid?
08:25:30 <cn3m[m]> Graphene Phone > iPhone > Pixel > Motorola > Samsung
08:25:50 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "Is it something they can't avoid"> it's their choice
08:26:06 <cn3m[m]> it's not being forced
08:26:11 <cn3m[m]> it's the nature of how things work
08:26:14 <cg_droid> It's like waking up with a nightmare...
08:26:39 <cg_droid> If that's the real truth
08:27:07 <cn3m[m]> it's simple don't have the government in your threat model
08:27:09 <cn3m[m]> which you shouldn't anyway
08:27:46 <cg_droid> cn3m[m], maybe they must control everything
08:27:53 <cn3m[m]> they could coerce root certs or abuse the other roots of trust in countless other ways as outlined earlier in the email and domain discussion
08:28:02 <cg_droid> But wait a moment, they are already controlling it
08:28:16 <cg_droid> That's true
08:28:33 <cn3m[m]> I'm not saying don't try to avoid dragnet surveillance
08:28:43 <cn3m[m]> you can and should
08:28:46 <cg_droid> Maybe it's impossible to avoid
08:28:55 <cn3m[m]> however it's pointless to worry about toggles not working
08:28:58 <cg_droid> If they control internet...
08:29:07 <cn3m[m]> or root certs or firmware
08:29:21 <cn3m[m]> they can always fly a drone and spy on your password entry
08:29:26 <cg_droid> Yes
08:29:32 <cn3m[m]> they might even be able to use fidar
08:29:43 <cg_droid> It sounds paranoid but...
08:29:54 <cg_droid> fidar?
08:30:14 <cn3m[m]> flir
08:30:52 <cg_droid> what is it?
08:31:03 <cn3m[m]> typo
08:31:06 <cn3m[m]> typo
08:33:24 <cn3m[m]> heatmapping vision
08:33:45 <cg_droid> I always think we can avoid (not entirely) publicity while we use our browser and reduce the data we share with some companies, but not an agency of the government if you are a target
08:33:49 <cg_droid> Ah ok
08:34:16 <cg_droid> There are many 0-days out there we don't know and not patched
08:35:17 <cg_droid> And if Linux is so fucked, and Internet works in the most part with Linux...
08:35:21 <cn3m[m]> Linux can have hundreds unfixed regularly
08:36:15 <cg_droid> Or what about BGP hijacking?, it's not solved
08:36:36 <cn3m[m]> That's a good point
08:36:51 <cg_droid> It's a bug in all internet
08:36:51 <cn3m[m]> That's a good point
08:36:52 <lvkm[m]> this is sad, frightening, infuriating and funny at the same time
08:36:53 * lvkm[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200524-113316_1_1.jpg (17KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/zhpySJdivvxASXjmSEIMEEqP >
08:37:20 <cg_droid> lvkm[m], lol
08:37:24 <lvkm[m]> this is sad, frightening, infuriating and funny at the same time
08:37:27 <cn3m[m]> just worry about advertisers and hackers
08:37:34 <cg_droid> yes
08:38:32 <cn3m[m]> I use GrapheneOS for privacy. Daniel knows way more about privacy than any one I have met outside of the ad tech community
08:38:52 <cg_droid> Yes, a great experrt
08:39:01 <cg_droid> Yes, a great expert
08:39:33 <cg_droid> But even experts are limited
08:39:52 <cg_droid> And he can't do everything
08:40:34 <cg_droid> Maybe the only thing I could help is to translate to Spanish language the website lol
08:40:52 <lvkm[m]> two words come to mind. offline and burner
08:41:14 <cg_droid> lvkm[m], üôÇ
08:41:32 <lvkm[m]> grapheneos + burner hotspot maybe
08:42:25 <cg_droid> In this case the Kevin Mitnick book is good lol it's almost impossible to be hidden
08:42:36 <cn3m[m]> <cg_droid "Maybe the only thing I could hel"> unfortunately the work needed in verifying the web site is immense. I doubt he could do it in a language he might not know. He gets attacked by fanatics for what he puts on there
08:43:06 <cg_droid> We could do it in more than 1 person only
08:43:12 <cg_droid> Deepl is a good translator to check
08:43:26 <cg_droid> So, it's not only the work of 1 person
08:43:42 <cg_droid> Deepl gives good results to check the translation
08:44:08 <cn3m[m]> unfortunately they hang him on every word
08:44:14 <cn3m[m]> ask him
08:44:15 <cn3m[m]> for sure
08:44:17 <cg_droid> I understannd
08:44:19 <cg_droid> No problem
08:44:33 <cn3m[m]> never hurts to offer, but people need to know English to use the rom I imagine
08:45:54 <cn3m[m]> an unofficial Spanish fork could be interesting, but I'm not even sure there's enough reputable security material that's not bull in Spanish to warrant this type of ROM
08:47:30 <cg_droid> Anyway almost all people understand English now or can use translators
08:48:56 <cn3m[m]> your never know
08:48:57 <cn3m[m]> definitely offer it
08:49:39 <cg_droid> ok
09:08:32 <xabierd[m]> I can also help with the translation to spanish, software or documentation.
09:09:32 <xabierd[m]> Is only english supported on graphene OS?
09:11:07 <cg_droid> xabierd[m], and I know another Spanish guy using GOS
09:12:40 <cg_droid> I think strcat[m] update this part of the website: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
09:12:48 <cg_droid> I think strcat[m] updated this part of the website: https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
09:14:10 <cn3m[m]> oh wow weird
09:14:18 <cn3m[m]> I was just reading that as you said that
09:16:04 <cg_droid> lol
09:16:37 <cg_droid> I think he added what he posted in Twitter
09:17:37 <cg_droid> https://nitter.net/DanielMicay/status/1264272017337004034?p=v
09:22:23 <cg_droid> xabierd[m], from Barcelona?
09:39:23 <xabierd[m]> Basque country
09:39:37 <cg_droid> Ah ok, from the South here üôÇ
09:41:27 <joshman[m]> Dominican Republic here
09:41:52 <cg_droid> joshman[m], great!
09:48:08 <gervarouge[m]> <blueazul[m] "Is grapheneos as usable than /e/"> GrapheneOS is more usable for privacy and security
09:48:14 <EssentialChaos[m> blueazul: Graphene doesn't have MicroG, otherwise it's just as Android, but more secure
09:48:27 <gervarouge[m]> It is also generally a much newer version of Android
09:48:30 <gervarouge[m]> Which brings many benefits
09:48:37 <EssentialChaos[m>  * blueazul: Graphene doesn't have MicroG, otherwise it's just AOSP, but more secure
09:49:05 <gervarouge[m]> It's normal Android
09:49:14 <EssentialChaos[m> blueazul: There's a default browser on GrapheneOS, Vanadium, it's based on Chromium
09:49:19 <gervarouge[m]> Vanadium is the secure browser by default
09:49:28 <EssentialChaos[m> As an app store you can get F-droid
09:50:07 <EssentialChaos[m> And then from F-droid you can get Aurora Store, which can download apps from play market
09:50:17 <EssentialChaos[m> blueazul: No, I don't think so
09:50:29 <gervarouge[m]> Vanadium doesn't support searx
09:50:40 <EssentialChaos[m> I don't have Graphene, but I assume it uses DuckDuckGo, right?
09:50:49 <gervarouge[m]> It does
09:51:47 <gervarouge[m]> Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo(default), Ecosia
09:52:06 <EssentialChaos[m> Also, afaik, /e/ provides some cloud storage, right?
09:52:23 <cg_droid> gervarouge[m], Now that I see... it's true. Do you know why?
09:52:24 <EssentialChaos[m> They have an /e/ account thing
09:52:44 <gervarouge[m]> That rom is insanely insecure and lies about security patches
09:52:47 <cg_droid> gervarouge[m], about searx
09:53:02 <gervarouge[m]> It shouldn't be taken seriously
09:53:08 <EssentialChaos[m> blueazul: They host a NextCloud instance
09:53:10 <EssentialChaos[m> Idk, if Nextcloud can encrypt stuff
09:53:12 <gervarouge[m]> > gervarouge, Now that I see... it's true. Do you know why?
09:53:12 <gervarouge[m]> What's true?
09:53:16 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Idk, if Nextcloud can encrypt stuff at rest
09:53:26 <gervarouge[m]> > gervarouge, about searx
09:53:26 <gervarouge[m]> Since it uses default Chromium list
09:53:41 <cg_droid> gervarouge[m], ah ok
09:53:48 <gervarouge[m]> No point reinventing the wheel
09:54:19 <EssentialChaos[m> The /e/ ROM is basically Lineage for MicroG, but with a different launcher and a couple of preinstalled apps
09:54:36 <gervarouge[m]> It's far worse than Lineage for security and privacy
09:55:25 <gervarouge[m]> Lineage is already breaking Android security to work
09:55:29 <gervarouge[m]> They take it even farther
09:55:32 <EssentialChaos[m> How?
09:55:33 <gervarouge[m]> If you need microg get a Pixel with CalyxOS
09:56:15 <eligiblecoffee[m> Is gcam unsafe to use with graphene os
09:56:37 <gervarouge[m]> > How?
09:56:37 <gervarouge[m]> They break all persistence protections since Android 4.4, they lie about security patches, they break parts of the sandbox, and they are 6-9 months late on Android version updates
09:56:44 <gervarouge[m]> <eligiblecoffee[m "Is gcam unsafe to use with graph"> Define safe, but probably
09:57:23 <eligiblecoffee[m> gervarouge: safe in a sense that google doesn't track
09:57:25 <gervarouge[m]> Lineage and /e/ are not security friendly it's better to run Stock Android with Google and stock apps disabled rather than run than for privacy and security
09:57:44 <gervarouge[m]> > gervarouge: safe in a sense that google doesn't track
09:57:45 <gervarouge[m]> Are you using any other Google apps?
09:57:50 <EssentialChaos[m> eligiblecoffee: You can probably disable network usage
09:58:09 <eligiblecoffee[m> gervarouge: no. Just the gcam. Rest of the apps are open source
09:58:40 <gervarouge[m]> > gervarouge: no. Just the gcam. Rest of the apps are open source
09:58:40 <gervarouge[m]> Disable network for that app and you should be fine
09:59:03 <eligiblecoffee[m> EssentialChaos: yes I have done that. And there was an app uploaded on github by a user. It was a stub implementation of microg just to enable gcam
09:59:17 <gervarouge[m]> > Well e is my main mobile os and I am happy so far
09:59:17 <gervarouge[m]> The problem is they aren't being honest about security patches and breaking all Major security advances since Android 4.4
09:59:41 <gervarouge[m]> CalyxOS on a Pixel is a full replacement for /e/ without security issues
09:59:56 <gervarouge[m]> GrapheneOS is even better, but no microg
10:01:51 <gervarouge[m]> Custom ROMs beside GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, RattlesnakeOS, and too a much lesser extent GlassROM aren't built for anything but speed and latest Android version. The security and privacy features aren't there
10:03:35 <blueazul[m]> As I understand it's a very particular os
10:03:35 <blueazul[m]> I will not get a phone which doesn't provide spare parts
10:03:35 <blueazul[m]> And I want to be able to remove the battery
10:03:45 <blueazul[m]> Do they sell preinstalled phones?
10:04:04 <EssentialChaos[m> No
10:04:27 <blueazul[m]> Mmm maybe e should try to bring grapheneos features
10:04:47 <gervarouge[m]> > And I want to be able to remove the battery
10:04:47 <gervarouge[m]> Check iFixIt it's $30 and a medium difficulty battery replacement
10:05:04 <gervarouge[m]> Pixel 3a is pretty replaceable
10:05:28 <blueazul[m]> Alright thanks
10:06:28 <gervarouge[m]> No they can't
10:06:46 <blueazul[m]> Could be insteresting in the near futur to have a second phone
10:06:54 <gervarouge[m]> GrapheneOS starts at the hardware level for security and privacy
10:07:23 <gervarouge[m]> They are the only known device to have real randomized mac
10:07:39 <gervarouge[m]> Probably iPhone too
10:07:54 <blueazul[m]> What about the company behind grapheneos?
10:07:54 <gervarouge[m]> Almost all phones don't
10:08:24 <gervarouge[m]> > What about the company behind grapheneos?
10:08:24 <gervarouge[m]> It's not a company
10:09:22 <gervarouge[m]> The dev has proven himself he was forced to pick between his job and turning on his users probably to the government and he protected his users
10:10:27 <blueazul[m]> Who is the government
10:11:36 <gervarouge[m]> It's speculated the government wanted to take over the ROM via his business partner
10:11:54 <gervarouge[m]> He wouldn't turn over the keys and lost his job defending his users
10:11:57 <cg_droid> gervarouge[m], :-o
10:13:09 <gervarouge[m]> He's an AOSP Contributor and GrapheneOS is a Google Security Partner. It's a one of a kind project
10:15:01 <blueazul[m]> Google Security Partner means that he works with/for google?
10:15:27 <cn3m[m]> <blueazul[m] "Google Security Partner means th"> it means they trust him so they share patches ahead of time
10:18:27 <gervarouge[m]> Works with not for
10:20:14 <blueazul[m]> Why he stays in the U.S., if google doesn't protect him from the government, it's a strange story
10:22:55 <blueazul[m]> I didn't know the story but this is my main concern that at some point the government or/and a tech giant will collecting the profits
10:28:08 <blacklight447[m]> Question
10:28:13 <blacklight447[m]> If i force my phone to only use lte (4g) does that mean that people calling me also need to be on 4g?
10:30:32 <SystemLord[m]> No
10:31:46 <cx2[m]> Personally can't say for certain. BUT, I've been "roaming" and still called folks that I would imagine e were not also "roaming"... In other words they didn't also need to be roaming to receive my call / text
10:36:27 <cg_droid> gervarouge[m], Where was Daniel working before?, what you told makes me admires him even more.
10:43:24 <eligiblecoffee[m> blacklight447: no. LTE only means it will just use LTE for making calls and internet. It won't switch to 3g network.
10:43:46 <cg_droid> In GOS default apps, which ones do you consider innecesary to maintain the Network permission?: I disabled Auditor (doubts), Contacts, CaptivePortalLogin (yes, I know), Print Service Recommendation Service and the other Print permission (I don't use printers). Do you know which more can I disabled wiithout causing harm?
10:44:13 <eligiblecoffee[m> blacklight447: since volte isn't enabled, calls won't be made on LTE only mode.
10:45:15 <blacklight447[m]> <eligiblecoffee[m "blacklight447: no. LTE only mean"> I see
10:45:37 <blacklight447[m]>  Im just wondering why i cannot seem to call my girlfriend when i select "4g only"
10:46:21 <eligiblecoffee[m> blacklight447: its because volte isn't supported on graphene os yet.
10:48:24 <blacklight447[m]> Ah i see, is this planned any time soon
10:49:15 <blacklight447[m]> I would love to switch to 4g only to disable all this legacy crap
10:49:30 <blacklight447[m]> But being unable to call is quite the tradeoff atm
10:49:37 <cg_droid> 4g only means that if it's not available you lose connectivity?
10:51:15 <eligiblecoffee[m> blacklight447: I don't think it will happen anytime soon since not enough developers are there to implement it at this time.
10:51:46 <blacklight447[m]> 4g only means that it will only use 4g for a connection
10:51:46 <blueazul[m]> > Works with not for
10:51:46 <blueazul[m]> You are okay with that, also buying a phone from one of the biggest malware manufacturer
10:52:39 <blacklight447[m]> It will refuse to connect to 3g networks
10:52:40 <blacklight447[m]> So yes, if there is no 4g, there will be no connectifity
10:52:52 <cg_droid> blacklight447[m], ok, thanks
10:53:17 <cg_droid> blacklight447[m], do you know about what I asked before about apps in Network permissions?
10:57:57 <blueazul[m]> Every cent and effort you put in google is for fiscal optimisation and more offensive behavior
11:10:34 <blacklight447[m]> <blueazul[m] "Every cent and effort you put in"> Your free not to not buy a pixel and not use graphene
11:10:34 <matic_nick[m]> The fuck is happening on reddit?
11:12:17 <blacklight447[m]> <matic_nick[m] "The fuck is happening on reddit?"> Link?
11:12:26 <cg_droid> lol
11:13:08 <dazinism> blueazul: GrapheneOS builds from the most secure open source operating system.
11:13:58 <dazinism> It uses Pixels because they are, probably, the only devices that properly support verified boot
11:14:30 <dazinism> Also the Pixel 3 onwards has the Titan M security chip that gives significant advantages
11:14:31 <EssentialChaos[m> dazinism: Also the Titan chip
11:14:53 <matic_nick[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Link?"> The arguments on r/firefox which then scattered everywhere by the same op

11:16:01 <dazinism> ^ now with exciting multi-colour text
11:16:30 <dazinism> Just about to add some more info about FairPhone3
11:29:29 <matic_nick[m]> Daniel's points on why the current browser privacy is broken is definitely interesting. Has he ever publish any research material on it? I'd be very likely subscribe
11:50:51 <dazinism> Added the Fairphone3 info. Looks like they probably do have some kind of verified boot working
11:51:26 <EssentialChaos[m> Is an Android phone?
11:51:31 <EssentialChaos[m>  * Is it an Android phone?
11:54:31 <Arhu> Yes
11:57:18 <limitless0[m]> cn3m: as someone who worked on advertising what would be best way to block ads/trackers? Daniel explained that we cant really avoid data be transferred via first party app dev server but aside from that what can we use? Im using netguard blocking by default and just letting through first party domains of specific websites i visit.but now it just feels useless to use it
11:58:58 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], dns.adguard.com as Private DNS?
12:03:37 <limitless0[m]> Graph.facebook still goes through that last time i tried
12:06:06 <cg_droid> Daniel posted this link: https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/m/mobile.action#page/14025071

12:07:56 <cg_droid> strcat[m], incredible...
12:08:18 <strcat[m]> Mozilla literally using 4chan posts to direct harassment and threats towards me
12:10:23 <cg_droid> strcat[m], they'll use whatever they can... is there a solution to this?
12:10:54 <cg_droid> You can't write a book or many pages to refute all they can say
12:11:37 <cg_droid> The more you answer the more they'll attack. Maybe leaving them alone with their nonsense could work, IDN
12:15:18 <limitless0[m]> You cant fight ignorance. Just leave it be
12:16:31 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], sorry, I confused Private DNS with what you asked about ads
12:18:01 <strcat[m]> limitless0: not leaving it be, I'll make posts on the site documenting the dishonest and unethical behavior of individual Mozilla employees
12:18:04 <strcat[m]> and will spread that around
12:18:19 <strcat[m]> they want to play this game
12:18:24 <strcat[m]> unlike them I won't make up dishonest claims
12:18:58 <strcat[m]> if they are going to try to harass and silence me like this using their sockpuppet accounts
12:19:12 <strcat[m]> Mozilla is thoroughly bankrupt of having ethics
12:19:20 <limitless0[m]> <strcat[m] "limitless0: not leaving it be, I"> I understand but i dont think its healthy to comment on every site they comment /attack you
12:19:42 <strcat[m]> limitless0: I'm not a public figure and they're waging a misinformation campaign against me
12:19:50 <thelearner[m]> There's nothing wrong with a good fight, but picking the right battles is the way to go.
12:19:55 <strcat[m]> limitless0: I need to at least post a response on our site
12:20:12 <strcat[m]> thelearner: picking my battles == letting the community here deal with it if people cared to help
12:20:30 <strcat[m]> so if people want me not to focus on this they should be dealing with it and you aren't doing enough
12:21:29 <thelearner[m]> Only so much you can tell a person, up to them to figure out on there own. Referring to reddit trolls etc.
12:22:21 <thelearner[m]> I do care to help, but to help graphreneos, not the trolls.
12:22:53 <thelearner[m]> Anyway, that's my two cents.
12:23:29 <limitless0[m]> <thelearner[m] "Only so much you can tell a pers"> What can someone like me say to them. I mentioned this last night on here. There are topics they commemt on that i have no clue about it, i cant just mimic what i learn from you cos i'll get stuck as soon as they ask a question or make a statement and i have nothing to say back apart from telling them to fuck off and leave you alone
12:23:42 <limitless0[m]> And i' ll get banned for that soon after anyway
12:23:51 <blueazul[m]> Is this the official grapheneos canal
12:24:00 <cg_droid> blueazul[m], yes
12:24:12 <cg_droid> FRom Spain?: canal?
12:24:52 <blueazul[m]> Don't you have a moderator to delete or ban these subjects
12:25:46 <cg_droid> strcat[m], what about some links in the website and Twitter showing they are wrong?, I mean some links where they can read the facts of what you say and they can't refute them
12:26:07 <thelearner[m]> Thought the same thing ^
12:26:19 <cg_droid> blueazul[m], it's not here
12:26:33 <blueazul[m]> Then why do you care
12:26:52 <cg_droid> Because they are attacking him, the GOS developer
12:27:00 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: I suggest reading the logs here for the past few days, etc.
12:27:01 <thelearner[m]> Misinformation is like wildfire
12:27:21 <cg_droid> strcat[m], ok
12:28:20 <blueazul[m]> <cg_droid "Because they are attacking him, "> Don't you have a safe place like a forum
12:29:35 <zaxxa[m]> Is bromite's solution of integrating ad blocking better for fingerprinting than using extensions, ignoring the main problems with content filtering?
12:29:37 <blueazul[m]> I mean 4chan, reddit... seriously
12:30:41 <blueazul[m]> The secure os cannot protect itself from basic attacks
12:32:20 <cg_droid> blueazul[m]: they also attack him there (reddit)
12:32:21 <matic_nick[m]> <strcat[m] "https://boards.4channel.org/g/th"> wow this is just pathetic

12:41:23 <cg_droid> The only thing I know for sure is that  Daniel will silence those mouths with its work: what he' s doing and what he'll do.
12:41:29 <limitless0[m]> Yea its 1om in uk now

12:43:00 <thelearner[m]> Agreed.
12:43:32 <thelearner[m]> What he's done, speechless.
12:44:11 <thelearner[m]> Hope u guys going well in UK
12:44:16 <matic_nick[m]> This is just pure bullying and coming from an org such as Mozilla is just sad
12:44:21 <limitless0[m]> Anyone knows if this room can be bridged from telegram?
12:44:22 <thelearner[m]> And wish everyone the best!
12:44:49 <cg_droid> > Anyone knows if this room can be bridged from telegram?
12:44:49 <cg_droid> I know from xmpp
12:44:56 <thelearner[m]> limitless0: never used it, sorry.
12:46:22 <limitless0[m]> <cg_droid "I know from xmpp"> You bridging it from xmpp?
12:46:24 <cg_droid> Search for bridges from telegram to irc (freenode)
12:46:48 <cg_droid> If it exists
12:47:48 <limitless0[m]> <cg_droid "Search for bridges from telegram"> Will install telegram and try, riot is so slow unstable chats lag a loy sometimes
12:48:48 <cg_droid> limitless0[m]: install conversations app and open a free xmpp account in some server
12:48:49 <Arhu> Why not good old IRC?
12:48:58 <cg_droid> I use it now
12:49:38 <strcat[m]> blueazul: if you don't have a problem with people running a harassment campaign against the lead developer of the project for their technical statements, I don't really know what to say in response
12:49:43 <strcat[m]> for accurate, factual statements that I made within our community
12:49:50 <cg_droid> Arhu: not maintained as I know with free apps and very unstable maybe
12:50:01 <strcat[m]> I did not post blog posts or go around spreading this stuff with the aim of causing anyone any harm
12:50:15 <strcat[m]> I simply responded accurately and as thoughtfully / fairly as I could to people's questions
12:50:25 <strcat[m]> I always try to be fair to competing options like an iPhone
12:51:06 <strcat[m]> if I criticize something strongly and list out lots of things that are wrong with it, it's because it has serious problems and compares unfavourably to something else
12:51:33 <Arhu> cg_droid: depends on the platform
12:51:43 <strcat[m]> you can see the posts I have made about people's questions like iOS vs. GrapheneOS and I don't think I can be at all accused of not being fair and sticking to posting accurate technical information
12:52:10 <matic_nick[m]> I'm curious why is the attack purely towards Daniel
12:52:10 <strcat[m]> I actively recommend that most people just get an iPhone and use Safari with a popular VPN + popular content blocker
12:52:16 <strcat[m]> I just posted that the only day too
12:52:17 <cg_droid> > cg_droid: depends on the platform
12:52:17 <cg_droid> I mean in the smartphone
12:52:37 <strcat[m]> I am giving people accurate, factual and helpful information to help them understand the topics and their options
12:52:49 <madaidan[m]> This guy is becoming increasingly problematic https://reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/gokcis/firefox_is_insecure_refuted/frmhinx?context=3
12:52:49 <strcat[m]> I don't deserve having a harassment / character assassination campaign directed towards me
12:53:26 <strcat[m]> I am not going around posting stuff across communities and seeking out conflict
12:53:48 <strcat[m]> I only defend myself from these attacks, that's pretty much the only time I'm posting outside our communities
12:54:02 <strcat[m]> I should be able to freely do security research and write factual information about things
12:54:13 <strcat[m]> within our communities
12:54:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "I am not going around posting st"> BTW something up with hardened malloc?

12:55:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah ok
12:55:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will check here
12:57:25 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I need people to help with this nonsense, really
12:57:31 <strcat[m]> not just you and a couple others
12:58:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I expect Mozilla employees involved in this to respond to it too
12:58:07 <strcat[m]> or they are fair targets to be personally called out for what they are supporting
12:58:25 <strcat[m]> they sit by and support people posting false claims / misinformation that they know to be false
12:58:35 <strcat[m]> and they give them cover by being active in the thread and just not responding to either me or them
12:58:42 <strcat[m]> so they make it clear they are present and give cover
12:58:58 <strcat[m]> that moderator is doing the same thing: giving cover for a character assassination / harassment campaign based on false claims / misinformation
12:59:24 <strcat[m]> they are a participant in it hiding people an anonymous handle and daring to tell me that if I decide to post about what they're doing I better not use their real name
13:00:15 <limitless0[m]> If people from mozilla think that daniel is so wromg why dont they jump in this channel and discredit daniel in his own room? If they are so sure about all the stuff?! Or they know they will be teared apart
13:01:15 <madaidan[m]> <limitless0[m] "If people from mozilla think tha"> Mozilla knows he isn't wrong. That's why they stay silent and let the community spread the misinformation for them.
13:04:04 <strcat[m]> they are actively involved in it
13:04:04 <limitless0[m]> <madaidan[m] "Mozilla knows he isn't wrong. Th"> I know thats  why i said why dont they if they are so sure about it all. What best way to counter something on the very room he owns.but they are bullshit and hopefully more people like you with knowledge comment on them as i seen your replies on r/firefox
13:04:09 <strcat[m]> they come there and give cover for it
13:04:28 <strcat[m]> they participate on the peripheral so people know they are there
13:04:40 <strcat[m]> and there's that moderator giving cover for it and pretending to be neutral
13:04:49 <limitless0[m]> madaidan.: there you are again  from the other room
13:05:09 <strcat[m]> but he's just trying to give cover for posting heaps of misinformation and trying to do character assassination and direct harassment towards me across a bunch of communities / platforms
13:06:11 <madaidan[m]> <limitless0[m] "madaidan.: there you are again  "> I'm everywhere
13:09:01 <limitless0[m]> <madaidan[m] "I'm everywhere"> Agent smith
13:09:53 <matic_nick[m]> How does all this attacks benefit them exactly apart from losing more credibility?
13:10:43 <limitless0[m]> They dont losr credibility from the masses, only handful of people knpw where to read useful info
13:11:02 <limitless0[m]> Every google search reccomemd firefox linux
13:11:25 <madaidan[m]> <matic_nick[m] "How does all this attacks benefi"> More people will believe that Firefox isn't less secure and that those that spread the truth aren't knowledgeable
13:12:01 <strcat[m]> it is a symbiotic relationship with these clueless people posting misinformation
13:12:19 <strcat[m]> the Mozilla employees give them cover by being involved on the peripherals and not countering it
13:12:33 <strcat[m]> and they give cover to the Mozilla employees for harassing people who say inconvenient truths
13:12:49 <strcat[m]> Mozilla owns this harassment campaign
13:13:08 <strcat[m]> they are involved in it through anonymous handles and by giving cover to it via official handles
13:13:08 <dazinism> I guess its not ethical, but I can imagine why people working on Firefox dont want to confirm its weaknesses.
13:13:15 <strcat[m]> this is not just people in the Mozilla community doing it
13:13:28 <strcat[m]> Mozilla is choosing to encourage it, give them a platform for it and lend their support to it
13:13:40 <dazinism> Imagine some worry about the boss getting angry
13:14:01 <dazinism> Others it may be more of a pride thing
13:14:01 <madaidan[m]> <dazinism "I guess its not ethical, but I c"> People should be honest and open about the weaknesses of their software
13:14:29 <strcat[m]> that is why I talk about the insecurity of the Linux kernel, etc.
13:14:30 <madaidan[m]> They shouldn't be allowing harassment against people who point out those weaknesses
13:14:33 <strcat[m]> that is about GrapheneOS largely
13:14:39 <strcat[m]> explaining what we have to deal with
13:14:47 <strcat[m]> trying to get people to see the scale of the problem and want to help with it
13:14:53 <dazinism> Within coders/security community its been spoken about for years that chrome is more secure
13:15:09 <strcat[m]> I am not even allowed to talk about the weaknesses of my own project without being harassed
13:15:15 <matic_nick[m]> <strcat[m] "Mozilla is choosing to encourage"> That's nasty as shit. I'm sure this takes a toll for them in the security world
13:15:57 <strcat[m]> I am not allowed to tell people an iPhone is one of the best options without being harassed
13:15:58 <dazinism> But the privacy security love FF with all the about:config tweaks etc.
13:15:59 <zaxxa[m]> > I am not even allowed to talk about the weaknesses of my own project without being harassed
13:15:59 <zaxxa[m]> Damn :(
13:16:04 <cg_droid> Maybe we can help posting to leave forever Firefox browser of Mozilla team doesn't refute what Daniel posted. Many posts like these: "me too" and maybe they'll answer.
13:16:10 <strcat[m]> or to talk about the massive scale of the problems in the Linux kernel that we somehow have to deal with / mitigate
13:16:17 <strcat[m]> I can't write documentation on the site with technical information or I get harassed / targeted
13:16:35 <cg_droid> So it would be easy to help in some way
13:16:37 <strcat[m]> I get daily emails and messages saying all kinds of nasty shit and threatening me
13:17:07 <strcat[m]> renlord: opendmarc really doesn't work well
13:17:17 <strcat[m]> renlord: I figured out the main issue tho
13:17:23 <strcat[m]> gmail has a quarantine policy instead of reject...
13:17:49 <strcat[m]> because too much stuff will lose the mails if they do hard fail / reject
13:17:52 <strcat[m]> really sucks
13:21:44 <dazinism> *privacy/security power users love FF
13:21:51 <dazinism> *tend to love FF
13:22:02 <strcat[m]> cg_droid: I want them to refute the misinformation the OP posted
13:22:04 <strcat[m]> they know it is misinformation
13:22:15 <cg_droid> strcat[m]: yes
13:22:49 <strcat[m]> if they don't do that, they are supporting this
13:23:01 <strcat[m]> and when they support a misinformation campaign personally targeting someone
13:23:10 <strcat[m]> they make themselves valid targets for being called out as individuals
13:23:34 <strcat[m]> not just as a company
13:23:39 <cg_droid> That's why they could answer if many people say they will leave Firefox
13:23:50 <strcat[m]> I don't think that's helpful
13:24:00 <strcat[m]> I think it's helpful to counter these things within these threads they make
13:24:04 <strcat[m]> but that's all
13:24:08 <strcat[m]> don't make more threads
13:24:37 <strcat[m]> my goal is not informing random people on the internet about web browsers
13:24:42 <cg_droid> I mean answering in those threads
13:24:51 <strcat[m]> I just want to be left alone and to be able to write GrapheneOS documentation for GrapheneOS users
13:24:55 <strcat[m]> without being targeted / harassed
13:25:07 <strcat[m]> if this thread did not mention me and target me with character assassiantionb
13:25:22 <strcat[m]>  * if this thread did not mention me and target me with character assassination
13:25:24 <strcat[m]> then I'd obviously not be posting in it
13:25:27 <strcat[m]> I don't post in random threads about these topics around the internet
13:25:53 <strcat[m]> I only work on GrapheneOS and when people are personally targeting me elsewhere I try to defend myself
13:26:09 <strcat[m]>  * I only work on GrapheneOS and when people are personally targeting me elsewhere I defend myself
13:28:07 <zaxxa[m]> Guess he had 99 problems
13:30:53 <madaidan[m]> Maybe we can make a crawler or something to find stuff like this
13:31:11 <madaidan[m]> Organize a group of people to counter it
13:31:56 <Arhu> dazinism: privacy power users tend to love FF, security power users not so much
13:32:56 <strcat[m]> and btw by countering it I mean responding within these threads they make

13:34:53 <strcat[m]> rust still has prominent heap overflows in common stdlib code
13:35:02 <strcat[m]> treating security researchers like shit has consequences
13:35:07 <strcat[m]> why would I report any bugs to them ever
13:35:42 <strcat[m]> I've  literally linked heap overflow bugs in rust / firefox here before
13:35:44 <strcat[m]> and on twitter
13:35:47 <strcat[m]> that are unfixed
13:35:47 <strcat[m]> lol

13:37:54 <strcat[m]> since they can't break functionality on sites
13:38:13 <strcat[m]> zaxxa: also as I mention there
13:38:18 <strcat[m]> the first party origin can and does do tracking
13:38:32 <strcat[m]> and first party does not mean that when you go to QubesOS site, QubesOS is tracking you themselves
13:38:36 <strcat[m]> it can mean that
13:38:44 <strcat[m]> but it can also mean that what they choose to use for web hosting, CDN, etc. tracks you
13:39:21 <strcat[m]> zaxxa: so with https://www.qubes-os.org/ as an example, this is hosted via GitHub Pages (Microsoft)
13:39:55 <zaxxa[m]> So Microsoft could track you?
13:40:36 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "but it can also mean that what t"> What can they really track you with other than HTTP headers though? Github doesn't inject their own JS.
13:41:05 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they see all the traffic, your IP address, etc
13:41:51 <strcat[m]> also GitHub seems to use fastly
13:41:52 <strcat[m]> so there's another party involved
13:42:05 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: btw HTTP headers can set cookies
13:42:09 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and cookies are sent for each HTTP request
13:42:16 <strcat[m]> Cloudflare sets cookies on your behalf, you can't turn that off
13:43:27 <strcat[m]> curl -v https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2 > /dev/null
13:43:35 <strcat[m]> cloudflare sees all your traffic to and from gitlab, decrypted
13:43:40 <strcat[m]> < set-cookie: __cfduid=d9fe737b172b1605c7f601177b55533f81590327788; expires=Tue, 23-Jun-20 13:43:08 GMT; path=/; domain=.gitlab.com; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Secure
13:43:50 <strcat[m]> they set their own cookie(s)
13:43:50 <strcat[m]> they see the cookies gitlab sets
13:44:03 <strcat[m]> they see your IP address ofc
13:44:28 <strcat[m]> they see all the traffic going back and forth - even without modifying it (and they do modify with it), they can fingerprint and so on
13:44:42 <strcat[m]> Cloudflare is sitting between you and the backend servers
13:45:02 <strcat[m]> pretty sure GitLab uses Google Cloud
13:45:13 <strcat[m]> so Cloudflare + Google are both first parties, for GitLab
13:45:32 <strcat[m]> that is the source of the first party gitlab.com stuff
13:45:45 <strcat[m]> and maybe GitLab themselves do analytics / tracking, sure looks like it
13:46:02 <strcat[m]> at the very least they set 2 tracking cookies themselves + the gitlab tracking cookie
13:46:25 <strcat[m]> cloudflare actively looks at the traffic
13:46:30 <strcat[m]> I'm not saying google does that
13:46:40 <strcat[m]> but google sees the encrypted traffic going through
13:47:01 <strcat[m]> and they ultimately control the servers
13:47:15 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "and maybe GitLab themselves do a"> Probably why they're so dependent on JS for the most simple of actions
13:47:35 <Arhu> and if you email with anyone hosted by them, they scan your emails
13:47:36 <strcat[m]> so yeah you can go to GitLab and disable all the client-side third party stuff
13:47:43 <strcat[m]> how does that stop third party tracking?
13:48:00 <strcat[m]> GitLab hosts everything via third parties and might even share the data you give them themselves
13:48:02 <strcat[m]> just an example
13:48:09 <strcat[m]> this is almost every site
13:48:27 <strcat[m]> all you have control over are third parties in the client with extensions, etc. and they can see you're doing that
13:48:53 <strcat[m]> it is visible to GitLab and Cloudflare that you have modified stuff if they want to know
13:49:12 <strcat[m]> that is part of your fingerprint - your extensions, all the exceptions / decisions you have made with those extensions, the lists you choose to subscribe to
13:49:27 <strcat[m]> and by actively breaking stuff you're generating error reports for them
13:49:35 <strcat[m]> when you notice a site doesn't work and change something
13:49:40 <strcat[m]> they can see that
13:49:43 <strcat[m]> it shows up in logs
13:50:55 <strcat[m]> privacy is not making yourself stand out from everyone else including other people taking the same approach
13:51:28 <madaidan[m]> privacytoolsio would like to know your location
13:51:47 <strcat[m]> the Tor Browser approach of hiding source of the traffic + compartmentalizing state and making it ephemeral + anti-fingerprinting is a real privacy approach - doesn't mean it is a solid implementation of it without a lot of bypasses, since it has problems for sure
13:51:50 <strcat[m]> but that is a real privacy approach
13:52:04 <strcat[m]> so would be doing the same thing with a popular VPN and similar web browser features
13:52:16 <strcat[m]> it is actually a real attempt to provide meaningful privacy
13:52:20 <strcat[m]> enumerating badness is not
13:52:31 <strcat[m]> all these extensions pretending they are giving you privacy are not really doing it
13:52:56 <strcat[m]> they are just eliminating some low-hanging fruit on the client side and also making you easier to track by what they don't strip out
13:53:03 <strcat[m]> and they can't strip out the site itself, lol
13:53:04 <zaxxa[m]> Should you use password manager extensions then?
13:53:20 <strcat[m]> zaxxa: better to use the browser's own password management if you carea bout privacy
13:53:26 <strcat[m]> because extensions can often / usually be detected
13:53:36 <madaidan[m]> It's funny how nearly everything "privacy advocates" promote is snake oil
13:53:53 <strcat[m]> zaxxa: extensions have their own state, and need to partition it per site themselves, and they can be detected
13:53:59 <strcat[m]> and they need to respect stuff like incognito themselves
13:54:19 <strcat[m]> zaxxa: extensions are shared across pages and generally have state shared across them
13:54:31 <strcat[m]> so they're a big hole opened up in having the web browser compartmentalize sites
13:54:39 <strcat[m]> which every major browser is working towards
13:55:13 <strcat[m]> zaxxa: sites can see what extensions you have if they change stuff in the content and can detect how you have stuff set up
13:55:17 <strcat[m]> like which filter subscriptions you use
13:55:27 <strcat[m]> when they were last updated
13:55:33 <strcat[m]> and they add state shared across sites
13:55:45 <strcat[m]> they are a hole in semantic isolation between sites and the sandbox isolation between sites
13:56:10 <strcat[m]> of course, you could design an extension to not touch the content / reveal itself but that kinda implies not doing any of this stuff
13:56:41 <strcat[m]> if you want privacy use the Tor Browser for now
13:56:48 <strcat[m]> it has weak security though
13:56:54 <strcat[m]> and makes you into a target so...
13:56:55 <strcat[m]> shrug
13:57:03 <matic_nick[m]> To what degree does fingerprinting affects DNS blocking since more people are keen to use it?
13:57:17 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: sites can detect which DNS provider you use and what is blocked
13:57:33 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: so if you do DNS-based blocking it's a good idea to do it via a common provider and not customized
13:57:40 <strcat[m]> like dns.adguard.com or w/e
13:57:56 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: a site can generate a domain like
13:58:12 <strcat[m]> random-string.the-site.com
13:58:20 <strcat[m]> and so your browser queries your DNS for that
13:58:31 <strcat[m]> and your DNS provider queries the site's authoritative DNS for that
13:58:40 <strcat[m]> now the site knows your DNS provider
13:58:46 <strcat[m]> cause it's a random string so it won't be cached
13:59:27 <strcat[m]> and sites actually do this
14:01:10 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: max privacy would just be using the DNS your VPN provider / Tor exit node gives you
14:01:43 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: unless *most* people using the VPN with the same web browser use dns.adguard.com
14:01:45 <strcat[m]> or w/e
14:01:58 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: it's a complicated mess
14:02:21 <strcat[m]> matic_nick: the more you configure / change tho, the more you'll stand out tho
14:02:51 <zaxxa[m]> I only just started learning java and everything is confusing for me lol, so I just try and listen and learn :/
14:02:53 <strcat[m]> Vanadium is going to include built-in content filtering with an on/off switch (the switch is already there)
14:03:06 <strcat[m]> with a hard-wired list
14:03:10 <strcat[m]> so that is 1 bit of entropy more
14:03:11 <strcat[m]> on or off
14:03:27 <strcat[m]> lets say you can configure the lists, and there are 20 hard-wired choices, that's a fair bit
14:03:30 <strcat[m]> lets say you can add your own...
14:03:34 <strcat[m]> I think you get the idea
14:03:40 <zaxxa[m]> Yes
14:03:56 <strcat[m]> although few people use Vanadium atm so it can't provide much privacy yet - but eventually we could put it on the Play Store
14:04:12 <strcat[m]> and we'll also work towards matching Bromite 1:1 but requires us to add a bunch of stuff and to convince them to make some changes
14:04:20 <zaxxa[m]> You mentioned on your site eventually it may merge with bromite or something ?
14:04:23 <zaxxa[m]> Oh I see
14:04:37 <strcat[m]> we need to go through their changes and review / overhaul them
14:04:40 <strcat[m]> and submit changes back to them
14:04:50 <strcat[m]> and slowly align things with them from both sides
14:05:03 <strcat[m]> and get them to do the same changes as us too
14:05:10 <strcat[m]> I dunno how realistic it is
14:05:13 <strcat[m]> but there is progress
14:05:25 <strcat[m]> mostly we just need to add a bunch of missing stuff, requires a lot of work
14:05:26 <Arhu> Wouldn't you need a special version that doesn't reply on stuff GrapheneOS has over regular Android?
14:05:32 <strcat[m]> I added a few more bits in this latest release
14:05:44 <strcat[m]> Arhu: it would be the same Vanadium
14:06:06 <strcat[m]> the only way to detect GrapheneOS would be performance measurements via JS able to detect OS mitigations or w/e
14:06:06 <strcat[m]> which is possible
14:06:12 <strcat[m]> although JavaScript / DOM doesn't use malloc, etc.
14:06:27 <strcat[m]> and that can distinguish between different phones models, OSes, etc. anyway
14:06:32 <strcat[m]> this is one of the big advantages of iPhones
14:06:37 <strcat[m]> everyone is using the same few models
14:06:58 <strcat[m]> so sure you can detect differences between iPhones based on screen size and performance measurements, etc.
14:07:06 <strcat[m]> but there are hardly any different kinds of models
14:07:13 <strcat[m]> very uniform population of hardware
14:07:15 <Arhu> "It depends on hardening and compatibility fixes in GrapheneOS rather than reinventing the wheel inside Vanadium."
14:07:26 <strcat[m]> this is a big inherent advantage for iOS
14:07:33 <strcat[m]> Arhu: i.e. it doesn't bundle hardened_malloc
14:07:42 <strcat[m]> if we made it available elsewhere we'd have to bundle a hardened libc and hardened_malloc
14:07:46 <strcat[m]> among other things
14:07:57 <strcat[m]> because atm it just gets them from GrapheneOS, doesn't bundle that stuff itself
14:08:12 <strcat[m]> if you take Vanadium and run it on the stock OS you don't have hardened_malloc, etc. for it anymore
14:08:25 <strcat[m]> or our sandbox improvements that apply to the renderer sandbox
14:08:31 <strcat[m]> generic improvements that apply to every app
14:09:10 <Arhu> Oh I see, so de modification for the Google Play / F-Droid version is that bundled libc and hardened_malloc
14:09:18 <madaidan[m]> 4chan is cancerous as usual https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/76032766/daniel-micay-fans-on-suicide-watch
14:09:39 <strcat[m]> btw not really feeling well because of this stuff that's going on with people running a campaign against me for my technical statements here and elsewhere in the scope of GrapheneOS
14:09:48 <strcat[m]> getting a lot of nasty messages, etc.
14:10:09 <strcat[m]> don't get any break from this stuff
14:10:39 <Arhu> I thought 4chan hated FF/Mozilla
14:11:02 <strcat[m]> Arhu: maybe they do but doesn't stop mozilla people posting shit there to direct harassment at me
14:12:00 <Arhu> It seems like that, because the average 4chan post in relation to FF/Mozilla is about trannies
14:12:28 <madaidan[m]> <Arhu "I thought 4chan hated FF/Mozilla"> They hate everything
14:12:32 <strcat[m]> shrug pretty low to post all over the place including 4chan trying to direct harassment towards me based on a bunch of false claims / misinformation
14:12:33 <madaidan[m]> Except maybe Hitler
14:12:46 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: not all of 4chan is /pol/
14:13:02 <strcat[m]> they have a bunch of little uniquely fucked up communities
14:13:23 <strcat[m]> their culture is more fragmented than you might think and they hate each other too
14:13:54 <madaidan[m]> g is usually pretty bad
14:14:46 <Arhu> the boards I read are very /pol/-y: g, fit, lit, biz
14:14:51 <strcat[m]> also seems very much not in the spirit of 4chan to have sites archiving threads
14:15:04 <strcat[m]> it wouldn't be that much of a problem if they just shit talked with each other and it didn't get archived
14:15:34 <strcat[m]> do you think I want searches for my name to bring up 4chan threads like that
14:16:06 <strcat[m]> it's a very calculated thing to attack me personally by name instead of just making a post about the topic
14:16:18 <strcat[m]> and to include character assassination attempts targeting me
14:16:36 <strcat[m]> and for moderators / Mozilla employees who claim to be 'neutral' to give it cover and make it seem okay
14:16:43 <strcat[m]> they are participants in harassing / targeting me
14:16:46 <strcat[m]> Mozilla employees are
14:16:51 <Arhu> people on 4chan talking shit about you doesn't reflect negatively on you in any way
14:16:53 <madaidan[m]> I don't anyone would take 4chan seriously though
14:17:10 <madaidan[m]> They're known for being special
14:17:43 <strcat[m]> you should take them seriously especially since people doxxed me and they have my address
14:17:45 <strcat[m]> maybe you don't
14:17:46 <strcat[m]> I do
14:18:04 <strcat[m]> and 'people' here means Copperhead btw
14:18:23 <Arhu> and everyone gets called the same: fag and jew
14:18:33 <strcat[m]> I guess 'people' might be stretching it since it's 1 person without the usual human characteristics like empathy
14:18:40 <Arhu> and in your case leaf because you're in Canada
14:19:45 <strcat[m]> bringing up /pol/ anti-semitism doesn't make this seem any better
14:20:15 <strcat[m]> seriously do you want people making threads directing harassment at you on 4chan especially when people causing this have posted your address online
14:20:30 <strcat[m]> it doesn't look like they had much success that time - but this is an ongoing continuous thing
14:22:04 <Arhu> I just meant the /pol/ insults aren't very personal. They call everyone that
14:22:55 <Arhu> Literally anyone that gets mentioned there gets called that
14:24:22 <blueazul[m]> <strcat[m] "blueazul: if you don't have a pr"> I am not aware of that, are you a grapheneos developer?
14:25:06 <blueazul[m]> This is unacceptable
14:25:45 <madaidan[m]> <blueazul[m] "I am not aware of that, are you "> He is *the* GrapheneOS developer
14:26:09 <madaidan[m]> Btw the original thread was just locked
14:26:27 <blueazul[m]> So american? Do you think that's the reason or can't you just take legal actions
14:26:28 <strcat[m]> locked is enablement
14:26:34 <strcat[m]> means I can't respond further
14:26:55 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "means I can't respond further"> What's there to respond to though?
14:27:04 <strcat[m]> because I haven't had time to actually sit down and write a technical response to their BS
14:27:06 <madaidan[m]> Looks like we got the last word
14:27:45 <strcat[m]> this is my experience with Mozilla over the years tho
14:28:00 <strcat[m]> before GrapheneOS
14:28:03 <strcat[m]> when I worked on their projects
14:28:12 <strcat[m]> all the same tactics
14:28:33 <madaidan[m]> Do you have examples? Sounds interesting.
14:28:34 <strcat[m]> make dishonest claims, post tons of misinformation / spin and refuse to acknowledge that it has been refuted
14:28:42 <madaidan[m]> We can compile a list.
14:28:48 <strcat[m]> when I say what they are doing, say I am being uncivil / rude
14:28:49 <matic_nick[m]> By the looks of it, looks like you guys are just replying to antivax
14:29:04 <strcat[m]> it is 100% my experience with Rust
14:29:05 <strcat[m]> again
14:29:20 <strcat[m]> and also having broad community people piling on with character assassinations / more misinformation
14:29:31 <strcat[m]> who don't even have a clue what's happening
14:29:38 <strcat[m]> along with lots of concern trolling and so on
14:29:44 <strcat[m]> that is my experience with Mozilla, they are a cult
14:30:01 <strcat[m]> you raise technical issues and they ostracize you and direct harassment towards you
14:30:09 <strcat[m]> and say you're being uncivil / rude / bad for calling out what's happening
14:30:22 <strcat[m]> btw they owe me money
14:31:46 <stuux[m]> strcat: I got a debug version of Auditor running and tested it successfully
14:31:52 <stuux[m]> although only with a messy workaround
14:32:04 <stuux[m]> thanks for your patience and time anyway
14:32:13 <strcat[m]> stuux: if that debug buildconfig thing is not set right
14:32:16 <strcat[m]> it sounds like a bug in the gradle build system
14:32:21 <strcat[m]> I haven't tested it for a while
14:32:25 <strcat[m]> maybe we have to do something to make it work
14:32:26 <strcat[m]> dunno
14:32:35 <stuux[m]> Yeah could be
14:32:52 <stuux[m]> I send you a pr with my patches
14:33:07 <Arhu> I stumbled on an offering of a new Pixel 3 for a reasonable price. Does it have a significantly worse battery life than the 3a? The specs wouln't suggest that, but I've seen someone mention that on /r/grapheneos
14:35:20 <strcat[m]> Arhu: no not really
14:35:35 <strcat[m]> maybe their experience is with the stock OS on the 3?
14:35:45 <strcat[m]> stock OS has much worse battery life generally
14:36:00 <strcat[m]> unless you install an app with a really inefficient non-Play push implementation
14:36:23 <strcat[m]> Signal's is not great but good enough that you still get substantially battery battery life than stock
14:36:24 <Arhu> I was suspecting he was comparing an old 3 to a new 3a
14:36:49 <strcat[m]> that'd also make sense cause batteries age despite the throttling on charging
14:41:20 <Arhu> There really should be an open notification standard, so that it would become trivial to have your app work with a notification server besides Google. It's a shame Huawei doesn't push for anything like this now that they're banned from Google services
14:56:54 <strcat[m]> Arhu: it's better if apps do it so there isn't a third party imo
14:57:06 <strcat[m]> if apps do it PROPERLY and especially if they did it via a library shared between them
14:57:08 <strcat[m]> it's not inefficient
14:57:15 <strcat[m]> and the OS is smart enough to schedule it to happen in the same wakeups
14:57:24 <strcat[m]> if apps used the same library and same intervals
14:57:36 <strcat[m]> the OS would make sure it happens in the same wakeups always
14:57:52 <strcat[m]> it is not really any measurably less efficient than having 1 server if it's scheduled together which it would be
14:58:05 <strcat[m]> it's only less efficient because apps do it inefficiently and do it at different rates
14:58:30 <strcat[m]> each app just needs to keep open a long lived connection for push and use regular keepalive checks to make sure it doesn't die
14:58:40 <strcat[m]> with IPv6 it doesn't really die much
14:58:55 <strcat[m]> it's  the carrier grade NAT crap for IPv4 that kills connections fast
15:01:36 <Arhu> surely that's inefficient for the use case where you have dozens of apps of which many only get notifications once in a while, but you don't want a big delay
15:02:31 <Arhu> ideally you could choose your notification provider like you choose an email provider
15:03:40 <Arhu> that also gives more privacy because you don't need a persistent connection from your device to the servers of many apps
15:07:07 <strcat[m]> Arhu: there isn't a delay because they keep open connections and use push
15:07:33 <strcat[m]> Arhu: it doesn't give more privacy - keeping open those connections isn't a privacy issue
15:07:43 <strcat[m]> going through a third party reveals to that third party about when messages, etc. are sent and they can correlate it
15:08:07 <strcat[m]> and the app still has to connect to the app's server every time anyway
15:08:23 <strcat[m]> it gets notified of a message and has to connect to it to get it
15:08:53 <strcat[m]> keeping open a connection doesn't use power - only the keep alive checks use power, due to needing to regularly wake up the device
15:09:03 <strcat[m]> and if the intervals are the same and scheduled via the OS properly
15:09:08 <strcat[m]> it will make sure they happen in the same wakeups
15:09:13 <strcat[m]> so having 10 vs. 1
15:09:30 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much different if done well
15:09:56 <strcat[m]> I don't think having a centralized notification server shared across apps is necessary at all
15:10:14 <strcat[m]> what's necessary is apps implementing their own push, efficiently, and using the same approach / intervals as other apps
15:10:38 <strcat[m]> the OS is already designed to run alarms, scheduled jobs, etc. in batches together
15:10:52 <strcat[m]> in fact all the normal scheduled stuff uses imprecise/flexible timing
15:11:12 <strcat[m]> so you can even have one thing asking for 4 minutes and once for 5
15:11:16 <strcat[m]> and it will just schedule both every 5
15:11:19 <strcat[m]> because it has leeway
15:11:32 <strcat[m]> you choose the leeway too
15:12:46 <strcat[m]> so what's really needed is a client/server library for push with sample app/server
15:12:52 <strcat[m]> and get apps to reuse the same library
15:13:08 <strcat[m]> it COULD support using a centralized server but it shouldn't be mandatory and I don't think it has much benefit vs. doing it right without that
15:17:09 <EssentialChaos[m> Interesting, I think, apps could use different intervals, if they are just the shortest possible one multiplied, e.g. 5 min - shortest, but you can set 15 min. It'll still coincide with other apps, just not every 5 min
15:18:18 <EssentialChaos[m> Although, now that I think about it, 20 min doesn't really coincide with 15
15:21:37 <Arhu> Let's say for example I want to receive notifications from Skype. If it goes trough a notification server of my choosing, Microsoft doesn't know where I am at all times because there is an open connection. They will only know when I act on that notification and start the app. That's a pretty important difference in privacy to me.
16:10:35 <strcat[m]> Arhu: that's not how it works tho
16:10:41 <strcat[m]> Arhu: the app can and does make connections whenever it wants
16:10:50 <strcat[m]> this doesn't remove any information they get about you
16:11:16 <strcat[m]> and they don't know (approximately) where you are unless you aren't using a VPN
16:11:58 <strcat[m]> also doesn't apply the same way to cellular that it does to wifi
16:12:14 <strcat[m]> your cellular data IP address for IPv4 is a shared IP address
16:12:27 <strcat[m]> and neither the IPv4 or IPv6 address is really tied to location
16:12:34 <strcat[m]> and even for wifi that's a really coarse thing
16:12:48 <strcat[m]> Arhu: anyway the app has network access, it can and does make connections when it wants
16:13:03 <strcat[m]> Arhu: you're claiming adding an addition third party while not restricting the app at all gives privacy
16:13:05 <strcat[m]> it's the opposite
16:13:28 <strcat[m]> the app just gets notified via push server and then has to fetch stuff from their server
16:13:43 <strcat[m]> and depending on the reliability of the push server they may check themselves regularly anyway
16:13:54 <strcat[m]> GCM is not super reliable for example
16:13:59 <strcat[m]> probably more reliable than anything else tho
16:15:36 <strcat[m]> if your IP address tells people where you are, go solve that problem 1st, not really how cellular works tho and you can/should use a VPN if you don't want sites etc. tracking you from a non-shared/centralized IP address
16:16:09 <strcat[m]> adding another party while not removing the access of the existing one can't really be an improvement
16:18:47 <strcat[m]> Arhu: also when an app gets a push notification it connects to the app's server to get the data unless they're trusting the third party push server with the data - it's also not generally reliable enough to do that
16:19:07 <strcat[m]> especially since it throttles etc
16:19:11 <strcat[m]> drops messages
16:22:44 <vThor> hello together, anyone else fail android-prepare-vendor? Did google change there site layout?
16:33:56 <vThor> never mind, looks like git pull && git reset did the trick
17:38:19 <gervarouge[m]> <cg_droid "gervarouge, Where was Daniel wor"> Daniel had an open source project (pretty much this) got a business partner who assisted the growth. He turned out to violate the agreement, steal donations, and want to break users security. You can read more about it on /r/CopperheadOS
17:38:43 <hypokeimenon[m]> What is RattlesnakeOS
17:38:45 <gervarouge[m]> He was more than likely bought out or trying to turn things over to the government
17:38:54 <cg_droid> gervarouge[m], ah yes, I know about that. I think you meant about a previous job
17:39:00 <cg_droid> Thanks
17:39:02 <gervarouge[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "What is RattlesnakeOS"> It's a project to build AOSP for your own device with AWS
17:39:16 <hypokeimenon[m]> <gervarouge[m] "It's a project to build AOSP for"> AWS?
17:39:23 <hypokeimenon[m]> Amazon web services?
17:39:24 <gervarouge[m]> It uses verified boot user builds it's very safe
17:39:31 <gervarouge[m]> hypokeimenon: yes sir
17:39:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> Ah ok
17:39:55 <gervarouge[m]> You build your own rom on the cheap
17:40:47 <gervarouge[m]> If you didn't trust GrapheneOS or CalyxOS built from source and didn't need the features and trusted AWS it could make sense. I see it as a cool project I wouldn't use it
17:40:49 <gervarouge[m]> Daniel is proven
17:42:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> have you heard of hashbangOS?
17:45:44 <gervarouge[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "have you heard of hashbangOS?"> Not good things
17:46:06 <gervarouge[m]> It's also avoiding blobs that are important and in a HAL Sandbox

17:57:19 <gervarouge[m]> That's probably the only options that will guard your security and privacy
17:57:22 <cg_droid> Have you received the update?...
17:57:35 <eligiblecoffee[m> Finally Bluetooth will be fixed.
17:57:57 <eligiblecoffee[m> <cg_droid "Have you received the update?..."> cg_droid: it will show up in few hours automatically.
17:58:18 <cg_droid> eligiblecoffee[m, ah ok, that's why I wasn't receiving it
17:58:23 <cg_droid> Thanks!
17:58:25 <gervarouge[m]> RattlesnakeOS has support for insecure devices like the Pixel 1, but with clear warnings so that's very acceptable
17:59:08 <cg_droid> Yes!, Bluetooth and sound...
17:59:26 <cg_droid> And Vanadium update
18:00:48 <dan-v[m]> Yeah just note @gervarouge:hackerspaces.be, I will be dropping original pixel support when android 11 lands.
18:05:11 <joshman[m]> Bluetooth fixed. Yaay. Finally can switch developer settings off
18:07:19 <hypokeimenon[m]> <dan-v[m] "Yeah just note @gervarouge:hacke"> are you a RattlesnakeOS dev?
18:10:02 <gervarouge[m]> <dan-v[m] "Yeah just note @gervarouge:hacke"> Wonderful good to know keep up the hard work
18:10:24 <gervarouge[m]> I think that's wonderful

19:03:06 <madaidan[m]> It's impossible to have a conversation with him.
19:07:01 <BrokenCog> for some reason even though choosecombo show's the target is arm64, 'm target-files-package' shows arm ...
19:07:19 <BrokenCog> any idea what would change the target other than choosecombo?
19:21:40 <strcat[m]> if you run it in a different shell
19:21:49 <strcat[m]> choosecombo sets up the current shell to build a target
19:21:56 <strcat[m]> if you use a different shell it's going to build the default target
19:22:30 <BrokenCog> it's all in the same shell.
19:24:00 <BrokenCog> I removed a previous build with: rm -rf ./out ./keys ./vendor/google_devices/ ... is there anything else that could be remaining???  Even though the previous build was a successful arm64 target currently flashed to a Pixel3aXL.

20:52:13 <cyredanthem[m]> It sure is. Np
20:52:21 <cyredanthem[m]> I would use Vanadium though
20:53:09 <limitless0[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "I would use Vanadium though"> I do use vanadium and bromite but i split the browsing into browsers
20:53:22 <limitless0[m]> Somehow i think its better
20:53:34 <limitless0[m]> News/twitter/etc
20:55:44 <limitless0[m]> Cant read news on vanadium cos no adblocking
20:56:45 <cyredanthem[m]> Use PrivateDNS
20:56:46 <cyredanthem[m]> I have dns.adguard.com set
20:56:51 <cyredanthem[m]> No issue
20:57:49 <limitless0[m]> I use netguard and it doesnt work well with private dns
20:57:51 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], Privacy Browser is a webview browser without protection, at least it's what I know from it and Stoutner, who wants to create a Privacy Webview. So, why are you saying it's more secure than Bromite. does it use the Vanadium webview in GOS?
20:59:22 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], you don't need Netguard with GOS
20:59:42 <cg_droid> Only from time to time if you want to check some connections
20:59:46 <limitless0[m]> <cg_droid "limitless0, you don't need Netgu"> How's that?
20:59:54 <cg_droid> You have the Network Permission in GOS
21:00:08 <cg_droid> And so, you can add a Private DNS without problems
21:00:30 <cg_droid> And deny permissions directly
21:00:40 <cg_droid> network permission I mean
21:00:50 <limitless0[m]> Network permission is all or nothing.in netguard i at least try to block ads
21:01:09 <limitless0[m]> Or so i think cos from what i have read its not that effective
21:01:16 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], so you add Private DNS with dns.adguard.com
21:01:51 <cg_droid> Or another DNS blocking ads
21:02:06 <cg_droid> It's fast and goes very well (adguard)
21:02:10 <cg_droid> I used Netguard before
21:02:26 * limitless0[m] uploaded an image: tmp.jpg (263KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/eGVNlaZgPIdTIuFchzcmZhab >
21:03:04 <cg_droid> Yes, I know. When you are browsing some website you can find those trackers
21:03:19 <cg_droid> But you know you're trusting the Network Permission to another app: Netguard
21:03:19 <limitless0[m]> It just feels more granular the adblocking with netguard
21:03:31 <cg_droid> And you can't use a Private DNs
21:03:34 <limitless0[m]> How im i ?
21:03:51 <cg_droid> limitless0[m], are you using GOS?
21:03:54 <limitless0[m]> Cod im giving permission to imternetbanyway to the app im using
21:04:20 <limitless0[m]> I have set the normal adguard dns on netguard
21:04:24 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem, Privacy Browser is a webview browser without protection, at least it's what I know from it and Stoutner, who wants to create a Privacy Webview. So, why are you saying it's more secure than Bromite. does it use the Vanadium webview in GOS?
21:04:24 <cyredanthem[m]> Read the Twitter posts lately from Daniel
21:04:27 <cyredanthem[m]> WebView has stronger hardening
21:04:30 <limitless0[m]> <cg_droid "limitless0, are you using GOS?"> Yes
21:04:51 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], yes, I mean if Vanadium webview works in all the browsers using android webview?
21:05:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Yes it does and it's hardened
21:05:13 <cyredanthem[m]> Bromite doesn't use that
21:05:15 <cg_droid> Then it's great cyredanthem[m] thanks
21:05:27 <cg_droid> I'm always in contact with Soren Stoutner
21:05:51 <cg_droid> But I avoided in GOS this browser and using Bromite, I didn't know it had isolation as Bromite now
21:06:05 <cg_droid> In this case I'll return to it üôÇ
21:07:29 <cg_droid> PRivacy Browser was always exposing my real IP when I used a VPN, but I'll check if using Vanadium webview has the same problem. Bromite works ok in this case.

21:23:39 <limitless0[m]> Signal with prepay sim used on simple nokia just to get the sms confirmation

21:25:49 <cn3m[m]> unless the app is malicious
21:25:50 <cn3m[m]> or the server is, but you can verify safety numbers and that is only partial compromise
21:26:30 <limitless0[m]> There was an article on how signal leaked dns querys few days ago
21:26:37 <limitless0[m]> Its patched now already

21:41:42 <cyredanthem[m]> Tor has a much stronger protection system
21:41:59 <cyredanthem[m]> You would have to compromise the directory system to attack it reliably
21:42:09 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], yes about webview but... "Using Vanadium is highly recommended. Bromite is a solid alternative and is the only other browser we recommend". "Chromium-based browsers like Vanadium and Bromite provide the strongest sandbox implementation, leagues ahead of the alternatives"
21:42:38 <cg_droid> It has isolation too because it's Chromium based
21:42:56 <cyredanthem[m]> It does, read farther
21:43:02 <cg_droid> Not Privacy Browser, but it's true Privacy Browser can use the Vanadium webview
21:43:02 <cyredanthem[m]> Vanadium has specific hardening patches
21:43:03 <cg_droid> ok
21:44:17 <cyredanthem[m]> Vanadium WebView is hardened
21:44:31 <cyredanthem[m]> It's all in the FAQ
21:44:57 <cyredanthem[m]> Usage Guide*
21:45:13 * limitless0[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/aqzKZUQAEMgoHVtzeyIURPTT >
21:45:29 <cg_droid> cyredanthem[m], WebView-based browsers use the hardened Vanadium rendering engine, but they can't offer as much privacy and control due to being limited to the capabilities supported by the WebView widget
21:45:48 <cg_droid> For example, they can't provide a setting for toggling sensors access because the feature is fairly new and the WebView WebSettings API doesn't yet include support for it as it does for JavaScript, location, cookies, DOM storage and other older features. For sensors, the Sensors app permission added by GrapheneOS can be toggled off for the browser app as a whole instead. The WebView sandbox also curre
21:45:48 <cg_droid> ntly runs every instance within the same sandbox and doesn't support site isolation.
21:46:08 <cyredanthem[m]> That's a trade off you have to consider
21:46:39 <cg_droid> yes, but it says Bromite has isolation and not the rest of the browsers using webview
21:47:05 <cg_droid> The WebView sandbox also currently runs every instance within the same sandbox and doesn't support site isolation.
21:47:12 <cyredanthem[m]> > yes, but it says Bromite has isolation and not the rest of the browsers using webview
21:47:12 <cyredanthem[m]> That's a factor if site isolation is a risk
21:47:41 <cg_droid> Yes, so Bromite is, as he said before, the only browser he recommends with Vanadium until now
21:47:58 <cg_droid> I think it's because it's also Chromium and has isolation
21:50:13 <cyredanthem[m]> It's a mixed bag
21:50:22 <cg_droid> Yes
21:50:24 <cyredanthem[m]> The mitigations webview is more important to me
22:01:30 <dan-v[m]> <algebro[m] "I wish there was a self hosted p"> self hosted wireguard + pihole works well.
