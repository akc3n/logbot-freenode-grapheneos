08:26:15 <globbot> channel logging requested by renlord: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
08:26:17 <strcat[m]> logging on the IRC side is the right approach
08:26:21 <strcat[m]> that's the canonical room
08:26:31 <renlord> ok invited.
08:26:38 <strcat[m]> matrix is like a perpetual netsplit with how sketchy it is
08:26:50 <JTL> Couldn't have said it better
08:26:57 <renlord> strcat[m]: you might wanna change the topic so you can pin the log URL
08:27:07 <renlord> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200416
08:27:10 <renlord> its working already
08:27:35 <JTL> I can refresh the page and it has less lag then the matrix bridge thingy
08:27:38 <JTL> lol :D
08:27:57 <renlord> if they add websockets, it'd run circles around the matrix bridge
08:27:59 <renlord> kek
08:28:14 <JTL> I have the same thought
09:19:19 <joshman[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "The only Google apps I have is t"> I would sacrifice gboard for google camera if anytime of the day. If only it worked with network settings disabled.
09:19:32 <joshman[m]> * I would sacrifice gboard for google camera anytime of the day. If only it worked with network settings disabled.
09:19:32 <joshman[m]> I tries gboard and tbh it freaked me out how good it was. Using OEM ATM 😕

09:20:17 <joshman[m]> I tried gboard and tbh it freaked me out how superior it was. Using OEM ATM 😕
09:20:58 <renlord> it is superior
09:24:41 * rutxonboard[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/dnIArIMFMJYedKNGafLPuXBy >
09:25:41 <nscnt> Why do you like Gboard; what's the deal?
09:26:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Trace typing is unmatched
09:26:05 <joshman[m]> I did. Yet its prediction service was so great I deleted it right away having fears of some internal AI (facepalm)
09:26:13 <rutxonboard[m]> Well Apple is probably matched
09:26:29 <rutxonboard[m]> But Gboard is the only thing on Android any good
09:27:14 <nscnt> Ah, okay. I don't use that. I'm fine with stock keyboard.
09:27:33 <joshman[m]> What's trace typing ?
09:27:43 <nscnt> This "swipe all over keyboard"
09:27:55 <joshman[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "But Gboard is the only thing on "> It is better than stock iOS as well
09:28:16 <rutxonboard[m]> iOS keyboard has some cool features though
09:28:25 <rutxonboard[m]> It is very smooth
09:28:34 <rutxonboard[m]> Gboard still probably wins
09:29:34 <joshman[m]> Honestly there's a single feature that I really miss on stock aosp. Its spacebar cursor movement. So much easier to input
09:29:52 <nscnt> iOS keyboard *is* smooth, yea. I like it better. Maybe just because I'm used to that for years. The slightly difference in the layout resulted in typos on GrapheneOS all the time.
09:30:15 <renlord> gesture typing on gboard is great
09:30:21 <renlord> not even ios keyboard can match that
09:30:54 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah, Gboard doesn't need net so I use it
09:31:17 <joshman[m]> I had gboard on iOS back in the days. And it was ages ahead. I then was using multilanguage keyboard editing legal texts was a charm.
09:32:38 <dazinism> Tried out some other keyboards from fdroid recently
09:33:01 <rutxonboard[m]> AnySoftKeyboard is okay with tracing
09:33:02 <dazinism> Think simple keyboard had spacebar swipe cursor control
09:33:15 <joshman[m]> renlord OK. I'm coaxed. Will install it again
09:33:33 <dazinism> But IIRC something about it was buggy
09:34:25 <joshman[m]> Oh. Really?  Will try simple b4 gboard
09:35:30 <dazinism> Maybe openboard had it too?
09:35:33 <nscnt> wow Gboard keys are huge o_o
09:36:26 <joshman[m]> They're adjustable
09:36:28 <rutxonboard[m]> Gboard is bae
09:37:20 <joshman[m]> Simple keyboard has got no text prediction.  Meh. Cant use it :(
09:37:31 <nscnt> Well, they could be the same size, but the design is different. In stock it's one color and the keys don't stick out.
09:38:07 <joshman[m]> OLED black theme on gboard is eye pleasing
09:39:04 <rutxonboard[m]> The Google logo is not
09:39:41 <joshman[m]> It can be disabled
09:39:55 <joshman[m]> I got OCD
09:40:12 <nscnt> rutxonboard[m]: In "themes"? To the bottom left?
09:40:33 <nscnt> The theme you're talking about.
09:41:18 <nscnt> Well the whole bottom row.
09:42:49 <nscnt> What Google logo?
09:43:36 <renor[m]> OpenBoard works great for me
09:43:43 <rutxonboard[m]> I have a Google logo in the top left
09:43:50 <rutxonboard[m]> It's so annoying
09:43:55 * joshman[m] uploaded an image: maxresdefault.jpg (42KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uWmtsSdPNEsevedjOszpvUsj >
09:43:56 <nscnt> rutxonboard[m]: I don't have a logo.
09:44:15 <joshman[m]> I had it off!
09:44:16 <nscnt> I don't have it lol
09:44:30 <joshman[m]> You can toggle in options
09:44:31 <renor[m]> https://github.com/dslul/openboard
09:44:40 <nscnt> I have the "incognito" dude where your logo is
09:45:37 <nscnt> ohh
09:46:00 <nscnt> It's because of Signal.
09:47:31 <joshman[m]> Open board
09:47:31 <joshman[m]> 1. No swipe
09:47:31 <joshman[m]> 2. Ugly
09:47:34 <rutxonboard[m]> Thanks I'll toggle it
09:48:14 <rutxonboard[m]> AnySoftKeyboard with increased height isn't bad
09:49:03 <joshman[m]> <renor[m] "https://github.com/dslul/openboa"> Thanks! Its for space bar swipe!!!
09:49:20 <joshman[m]> * Thanks! Its got space bar swipe!!!
09:49:59 <renor[m]> Yes it has the feature. Plus it has dictionaries for correction
09:49:59 <rutxonboard[m]> Someone on the privacytools matrix called Firefox for Android slightly less secure than Chromium. I had to point to Mozilla's own positions to prove how wrong that was
09:50:09 <renor[m]> And you can change the theme
09:52:05 <rutxonboard[m]> Firefox is such a joke. So is this whole I'm helping fight Google's monopoly
09:52:28 <rutxonboard[m]> If you block ads you're not showing up to the market share aggregators
09:52:32 <nscnt> Gboard swiping doesn't work nice when you've two languages set :/
09:52:40 <rutxonboard[m]> You're fooling yourself
09:53:12 <rutxonboard[m]> Anyway, use a WebKit browser and support a quality engine if that's so important
09:54:16 <renlord> chromium accepts contributions from everyone
09:54:19 <renlord> how is it a google monopoly
09:54:51 <rutxonboard[m]> Since Google could make choices that effect the Internet badly. Like DRM
09:55:20 <nscnt> rutxonboard[m]: I don't know what point you were trying to make. Could you clarify?
09:55:26 <rutxonboard[m]> Or making an adblocker that blocks ads they don't like
09:55:40 <rutxonboard[m]> > rutxonboard: I don't know what point you were trying to make. Could you clarify?
09:55:40 <rutxonboard[m]> About what?
09:55:55 <nscnt> This Firefox <-> Chromium
09:56:18 <renlord> they dont shoehorn these things into chromium
09:56:25 <renor[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Or making an adblocker that bloc"> There are alternatives for this. Plus Chromium has no adblocker integrated
09:56:40 <rutxonboard[m]> Just amazed the mental gymnastics people go through to defend Mozilla and Firefox
09:56:51 <renlord> i dont understand
09:57:42 <rutxonboard[m]> > i dont understand
09:57:43 <rutxonboard[m]> Right, but the idea is Chrome can do these things and if you use a chrome based browser that makes the internet think chrome is more popular so Chrome does more sketchy stuff
09:57:54 <rutxonboard[m]> That's not a wise argument at all
09:58:21 <rutxonboard[m]> Or even logical since these people block the trackers that would identify your browser
09:59:30 <rutxonboard[m]> Essentially people say I know Mozilla has bad security and insane telemetry. I don't care since I want to hurt Chrome. It is ridiculous
10:01:07 <rutxonboard[m]> Use Chromium, Firefox is a decade behind in browser security end of story. If you don't like Chrome buy an Apple device and use Safari
10:01:31 <rutxonboard[m]> It's simple, but the privacy community needs their solution to be weird
10:02:21 <rutxonboard[m]> rant over
10:02:35 <nscnt> ^^
10:02:45 <nscnt> To each his own.
10:03:20 <limitless0[m]> Whats wrong with default Grapheneos keyboard?
10:04:30 <rutxonboard[m]> No tracing
10:04:32 <rutxonboard[m]> No dark gray
10:05:21 <limitless0[m]> Whats tracing, prediction?
10:05:37 <rutxonboard[m]> Swype
10:05:43 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: When you swipe over the keyboard to write a word.
10:05:52 <limitless0[m]> Or swipe writing
10:06:02 <limitless0[m]> Thanks
10:06:31 <rutxonboard[m]> The only way you can't know what that was is if you used an iPhone for a decade and switched to Graphene 2 years ago
10:06:31 <nscnt> limitless0[m]: Nothing's wrong with the default keyboard. Just preferences for some.
10:06:51 <renlord> but chrome is not chromium
10:07:05 <limitless0[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "The only way you can't know what"> Even less than that
10:07:09 <rutxonboard[m]> Sure, but websites can't tell that
10:07:24 <rutxonboard[m]> So if Chrome is 90% market share
10:07:39 <rutxonboard[m]> It can decide what it wants to do and Microsoft, Mozilla, and Apple will just be broken
10:08:09 <rutxonboard[m]> Apple holds the lionshare of mobile traffic in the US. Chrome the desktop
10:08:15 <rutxonboard[m]> It balances out
10:08:22 <limitless0[m]> <limitless0[m] "Even less than that"> Less meaning few months on Graphene
10:08:47 <rutxonboard[m]> What did you use before?
10:09:25 <limitless0[m]> Iphone on restricted mode
10:10:08 <limitless0[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "What did you use before?"> Apple configurator profile on iphone is as good as any
10:11:00 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting, I am tempted to switch to iPhone. The iPad is getting good and could be the most secure laptop option
10:11:25 <rutxonboard[m]> iPhone would lower my attack surface
10:11:39 <rutxonboard[m]> I wish the Pixel C 2 was a thing
10:11:47 <limitless0[m]> Iphone is good,but Graphene is just so much liberating
10:12:13 <joshman[m]> How is your attack surface on iOS is less than GOs?
10:12:17 <limitless0[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "iPhone would lower my attack sur"> Well depends on ur threat level
10:12:17 <rutxonboard[m]> It seems like there is a lot of tradeoffs
10:12:31 <renlord> i dont think so, the chromium project has many stakeholders
10:12:33 <renlord> not only googl
10:12:45 <renlord> if google misbehaves, organisations are free to fork chromium
10:12:54 <renlord> microsoft and friends are capable enough to do that
10:13:11 <rutxonboard[m]> > How is your attack surface on iOS is less than GOs?
10:13:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Since if my PC is an iPad if I have a GOS phone there are now two ways to hack me
10:13:36 <limitless0[m]> I'll never use iphone again as long as Daniel maintains Grapheneos
10:13:42 <rutxonboard[m]> Same reason running Firefox on Android is so bad. You already trust Chromium as your WebView. Now two browser's exploits work on you
10:13:56 <rutxonboard[m]> Yeah I love Graphene, but I want a secure laptop
10:14:08 <rutxonboard[m]> And that's not an option outside of the apple ecosystem
10:14:16 <limitless0[m]> New ipads have mouse support
10:14:39 <renlord> rutxonboard[m]: laptops dont have the same hardware security modules as mobile devices
10:14:40 <nscnt> rutxonboard[m]: You're pretty restricted in the available applications you're able to run on an iPad. It's not a pc.
10:14:41 <rutxonboard[m]> Linux security sucks, no laptops have verified boot, no gui isolation, no arm support meaningfully
10:14:46 * joshman[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pqKyeWlWNLXCECzNhgVvJCeS >
10:14:52 <rutxonboard[m]> > rutxonboard: laptops dont have the same hardware security modules as mobile devices
10:14:52 <rutxonboard[m]> That's my point
10:15:02 <limitless0[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Yeah I love Graphene, but I want"> On iphone there is no orbot no split tunnel vpn no split profiles multi users
10:15:22 <renlord> so all the secure boot shenenigans just dont really work very well on laptops
10:15:40 <rutxonboard[m]> That's why I want an iPad
10:15:42 <renlord> or desktops for that matter
10:15:56 <renlord> the ios ecosystem just makes me so miserable
10:16:02 <renlord> the appstore lockdown
10:16:22 <rutxonboard[m]> And I don't want double the attack surface by having AOSP, Qualcomm, and Google firmware on one device. And the apple stuff on the other
10:16:36 <joshman[m]> I can't imagine my daily work on an iPad its so limited though secure
10:16:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Linux terminal
10:16:54 <rutxonboard[m]> Desktop Safari
10:17:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Keyboard and trackpad
10:17:03 <renlord> what terminal app to use on ipad
10:17:13 <rutxonboard[m]> iSH
10:17:15 <limitless0[m]> (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org) i havr used iphones since iph5
10:17:18 <renlord> is it free?
10:17:41 <joshman[m]> I have had iphones since 3G
10:17:41 <joshman[m]> Every Single model
10:18:07 <limitless0[m]> renlord (@freenode_renlord:matrix.org): and although Daniel recommends it i think is for mass people.iphones dont have privacy options
10:18:17 <joshman[m]> And every single time I switched to Android I went back to iPhone. Until Graphene happened
10:18:45 <limitless0[m]> <joshman[m] "And every single time I switched"> Yea i cant stand default android
10:18:54 <limitless0[m]> No way i can use it
10:19:00 <rutxonboard[m]> iPhone with no iCloud, telemetry, or location data could be in my threat model
10:19:20 <rutxonboard[m]> I dunno I might get an iPad and then see if I want an iPhone
10:19:31 <rutxonboard[m]> Purely for minimal attack surface
10:19:47 <limitless0[m]> If you have macbook you can lock it down even more with apole configurator 2
10:19:58 <joshman[m]> And minimal if no multitask possibility facepalm
10:19:58 <limitless0[m]> Apple*
10:20:35 <rutxonboard[m]> Maybe GrapheneOS and iPad is a better pair
10:21:05 <rutxonboard[m]> Then you get the benefits of both platforms
10:21:42 <limitless0[m]> If you get ipad then check out Guardian firewall
10:22:01 <rutxonboard[m]> Isn't Lockdown open source?
10:22:09 <rutxonboard[m]> I heard good things about that
10:22:17 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't believe in firewalls though
10:22:28 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't install things I don't trust
10:23:05 <limitless0[m]> Lockdown is as good,i named Guardian cos the developers are known security people Will stracht and always active on twitter
10:23:18 <limitless0[m]> Trusted by community
10:23:19 <limitless0[m]> As they say
10:23:35 <rutxonboard[m]> Interesting thanks I will give that a look if I do
10:24:02 <rutxonboard[m]> Any better ideas for laptops beside iPad?
10:24:28 <rutxonboard[m]> Something with full gui isolation, non Linux kernel, and full verified boot
10:25:38 <limitless0[m]> Cant go better than i pad i think but my knowledge
10:26:18 <limitless0[m]> Windows enterprise i heard have the option to disable telemtry
10:26:58 <limitless0[m]> Or windows LTSC
10:28:00 <rutxonboard[m]> Windows LTSC is good, but no support for gui isolation or verified boot
10:28:12 <rutxonboard[m]> Arm support is not great
10:28:22 <rutxonboard[m]> I think an arm Mac would be better
10:28:37 <rutxonboard[m]> It has minimal isolation, but a lot better than Windows
10:28:47 <rutxonboard[m]> Should have excellent arm support
10:30:16 <rutxonboard[m]> macOS is likely the best traditional desktop for power users and GrapheneOS for mobile power users
10:30:58 <rutxonboard[m]> iPhone and iPad for not power users that don't mind restrictions for a tiny attack surface across devices
10:31:14 <rutxonboard[m]> macOS security still sucks though even on arm I imagine
10:32:19 <cx2[m]> Latest update ota, yeah?
10:33:48 <rutxonboard[m]> > Latest update ota, yeah?
10:33:49 <rutxonboard[m]> Chromium 81 :)
10:35:59 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you review the dmarc reports?
10:36:17 <renlord> if so, do you use a particular tool to manage them?
10:36:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: not really don't care if people try and fail to send fake emails
10:49:55 <rutxonboard[m]> Hypothetically if an iPad is the most secure laptop option how much risk is it running with a Bluetooth keyboard. Not very familiar with the threats there
10:50:06 <rutxonboard[m]> I don't see how that part works
10:56:46 <joshman[m]> I have similar question. How much of a threat is using BT earplugs with graphene?
10:57:11 <joshman[m]> It is always recommended to have BT off while not in use
11:21:48 <nscnt> Is glide typing only available in English? It doesn't seem to work in e.g. German.
11:22:08 <nscnt> The animation doesn't show up.
11:32:33 <joshman[m]> On gboard it works with pretty much any language
11:46:12 <nscnt> mhh, not for me. don't know if I configured someting wrong
11:46:51 <hitchhooker[m]> Whats the point of seeing terrible amount of effort securing your device just to install glogger on it :p
11:49:19 <joshman[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "Whats the point of seeing terrib"> The answer lies in network settings toggle
11:50:10 <joshman[m]> Some say killing network access kills logging
11:50:51 <cx2[m]> is this true?
11:59:49 <flabbergasted> If it can't reach the internet, it can't transmit data. I don't see how it's a problem to use it.
11:59:55 <renlord> well, if you kill network permissions and app cant phone out
11:59:58 <renlord> how to send logs out?
12:01:56 <cx2[m]> yeah but there's the tinfoil hat-self that while running GOS is a sigh of relief, still seems sketch to run any Google apps....
12:02:21 <cx2[m]> problem is, I don't have the brainpower to do anything other than take advice from others
12:23:18 <hitchhooker[m]> Damn, I need option for reversing navigation bar. I guess its time for first PR
12:31:00 <nscnt> hitchhooker[m]: What do you mean? Mirroring the buttons?
12:31:53 <hitchhooker[m]> Yeah, been always using backbutton in right side
12:32:32 <nscnt> hitchhooker[m]: You could try out gesture navigation. It doesn't matter on which side you "go back".
12:36:11 <nscnt> It's the same as on iOS.
12:37:06 <dazinism> > iPhone with no iCloud, telemetry, or location data could be in my threat model
12:37:12 <nscnt> Except the "back", I guess, because iOS has buttons for it.
12:38:11 <dazinism> Dont iPhones have a bad habit of turning on iCloud backups with updates against user wishes?
12:38:34 <dazinism> Never used one. Maybe thats untrue?
12:40:14 <nscnt> dazinism: I turned it off a while back. Haven't had an issue. But I don't really use it anymore, tbh.
12:44:15 <nscnt> There were no backups that were made without my consent if I remember correctly.
12:46:18 <dazinism> Heard it mentioned more than once, but also people saying they nag to get you to turn it back on, and its easy to do.
12:46:32 <dazinism> Wondered if it had really ever happened
12:48:54 <joshman[m]> Happened to me a few. Once you turn it off it notifies your data is being deleted in 30 days..
12:49:30 <nscnt> dazinism: Yes, I get nagged when I turn it on once in while (as I'm using my Pixel as a main). "No backup for 2 weeks, please back up" or smth
12:50:14 <nscnt> turn *the iPhone on
12:52:53 <dazinism> josh.man: backups got turned back on without you asking?
12:54:25 <joshman[m]> It's tricky. You go through options and press ok somewhere it needs iCloud account it becomes active
12:55:15 <joshman[m]> Tinkering with iPhone you gotta be paranoic reading all the stuff carefully. Average users won't bother
12:57:05 <joshman[m]> Installed Gboard. Gosh, so comfy. Like my grandmas chair Though I'm sweating each time I text sensitive stuff
13:00:51 <dazinism> I'd heard backups got turned on with an update, but guess maybe folks got confused
13:01:23 <hitchhooker[m]> never liked keyboards that push you what to type and fuck you over if you decide to type another language without changing keyboard lang.
13:05:50 <renor[m]> What's your opinion on Huawei's HarmonyOS? It will be fully Open Source.
13:08:09 <joshman[m]> The one Russia is helping to develop? Or am I missing smth
13:09:03 <nscnt> I don't like the inconsistent UI of the settings in AOSP. It doesn't even match Material Design's own specifications. The colors are completely different in the Dark Theme.
13:09:11 <joshman[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "never liked keyboards that push "> I use 3-5 languages daily and I unfortunately find Gboard next to nada
13:11:04 <renor[m]> <joshman[m] "The one Russia is helping to dev"> I don't really know, I will investigate when I have some time.
13:40:30 <nscnt> joshman[m]: "next to nada"?
13:41:00 <jacksonpollock19> Isn't the nitropad with Qubes OS on it a secure laptop? @rutxonboard:matrix.org
13:41:23 <joshman[m]> Next to nothing
13:41:49 <nscnt> joshman[m]: You mean it's superior?
13:43:14 <joshman[m]> Yes sir
13:44:04 <joshman[m]> <jacksonpollock19 "Isn't the nitropad with Qubes OS"> I like nitropad "a very secure laptop" is being sold with Ubuntu 18.04 preinstalled 🤣
14:03:01 <hitchhooker[m]> josh.man:
14:32:25 <algebro[m]> Is there a specific security concern with Ubuntu 18.04 you are referring to?
14:33:17 <algebro[m]> Or are you just remarking that there is nothing special about it
14:57:46 <joshman[m]> I'm sceptical about Ubuntu in general. How can they claim being secure selling a laptop with 2 year old Debian fork

15:37:56 <algebro[m]> If you're alleging that Ubuntu is insecure I'm going to need you to back that up with some evidence
15:38:51 <algebro[m]> Otherwise its just another instance of FUD which is a far too common occurrence in the community

16:18:23 <blindfool[m]> imagen running qubesob on this hardware
16:23:06 <blindfool[m]> and if we talk about products like this, its all about the out of the box security you get, by buying those kind of products
16:23:06 <blindfool[m]> if you are in the point of calling this kind of product "insecure", you should have  enough knowledge to build such a systems on your own, therefore you are the wrong target group for this kind of products

16:35:43 <brenneke[m]> Thinking of flashing GrapheneOS, how is battery life typically?
16:36:13 <flabbergasted> Very happy with the battery on my 3A XL.

16:40:34 <madaidan[m]> <blindfool[m] "Ubuntu should be secure enough f"> Ubuntu isn't secure at all. There's no proper security model.
16:41:39 <madaidan[m]> <jacksonpollock19 "What's funny? Everyone saying la"> The desktop in general is insecure. iPads are far better. Qubes still has issues. There's no security within the VMs.

16:44:16 <manamex[m]> What you need is a terminal to ssh to  a server, plus a web browser
16:45:57 <flabbergasted> brenneke: I haven't run a ROM with Gapps in a very long time so I don't really recall how it was. I recently swapped from iOS.
16:46:03 <manamex[m]> A few years old Thinkpad with good old keyboard is all you need
16:46:33 <flabbergasted> I have a T470s, the keyboard is amazing.
16:46:45 <manamex[m]> Running gentoo so you have full control if what you put in it

17:21:19 <brenneke[m]> <joshman[m] "My guess is this Christmas"> Bummer, was really expecting this thing to last a longer than that, not really into upgrading device this year given the state of the world.
17:21:45 <manamex[m]> Gentoo is the only distro that gives you realistic chance to control what you put on your hardware
17:22:32 <manamex[m]> Essentials only and nothing more is what should want to allow on your system
17:23:16 <manamex[m]> "You should"
17:25:55 <joshman[m]> Never tried Gentoo though I know folks hop to BSD considering it "securer" until security gets compromised as with all x86s unfortunately
17:26:42 <joshman[m]> You still put Linux kernel with Gentoo on your hardware don't ya?
17:29:25 <brenneke[m]> Is GrapheneOS currenty Android 10?
17:30:12 <nscnt> brenneke[m]: Yes.
17:31:23 <nscnt> brenneke[m]: Guaranteed support for Pixel 2 XL is until October 2020. It's "just" guaranteed. It could be longer.
17:38:20 <nscnt> brenneke[m]: If you really want to keep support for the Pixel 2 XL, you could do work for it, I guess. You could have a chat with ~strcat[m] if you're interested in that.

18:09:54 <TheJollyRoger> Your privacy goes out the window if there is no security.
18:11:39 <nscnt> Privacy could be explained as data security, I guess. "Not wanting everyone to get (into) my data" like a security guard at a club or smth

18:20:42 <rutxonboard[m]> > But what about privacy?
18:20:42 <rutxonboard[m]> With Qubes I have a broken security model on desktop Linux which I have running and facing the net. I have reliance on Intel and various blobs. I also have a root of trust with Fedora signers and Qubes signers. It also has zero tamper protection
18:21:16 <rutxonboard[m]> Apple directly doesn't have any privacy concerns that fit my threat model if I turn off iCloud, location, and telemetry
18:21:47 <rutxonboard[m]> An iPad as a laptop in this case is a vastly better fit than my current setup of Qubes
18:24:48 <rutxonboard[m]> If EARN passes networking and services will be largely backdoored. Closed firmware to fix critical vulnerabilities could be shipped out with a backdoor. It's essentially a lost cause. The impact will be more direct with Apple(Signal pulling themselves from the App Store)
18:24:58 <rutxonboard[m]> iPad is more secure and private (since it better protects your data)
18:27:51 <Zenithium[m]> Tbh I don't know much about iPads but isn't it kind of just a smartphone without cell capabilities? I don't see how it can replace a desktop unless your daily usage only consists of browsing the web or something like that

18:29:27 <rutxonboard[m]> iPadOS 13 allowed support for 3 apps on screen. You can run multiple copies of the OS. It has keyboard and trackpad support. It is very very fast(i7ish). It has Desktop Safari. The app collection is second to none. It is on the edge of being desktop usable
18:30:11 <rutxonboard[m]> Multiple copies of apps on the OS*
18:31:02 <rutxonboard[m]> <rutxonboard[m] "Multiple copies of apps on the O"> With a Linux terminal you can pull off a lot
18:31:50 <algebro[m]> If you think a tablet can replace a desktop/laptop computer you must never have any actual work to do

20:41:54 <limitless0[m]> <cx2[m] "limitless0: sideloading begins t"> Not perfect solution but its an option
20:42:57 <cx2[m]> It's relatively easy these days to simply put together a fake profile, with anonymous(ish) payment, etc. Hell just use a hotel (not near your real address) as your address and within minutes you can create a fake icloud account.
20:43:18 <algebro[m]> Sideloaded apps have to be reinstalled every 7 days iirc
20:46:00 <algebro[m]> Not really a viable solution for pretty much anybody if that's the case
20:46:22 <limitless0[m]> Exactly what cx2 said a comment up
20:49:31 <cx2[m]> with a small bit of time and effort, and certainly not all at once, you can evade the large majority of folks attempting to sell you're life details. If you're threat model is that of a snowden? Then yeah, you're going to have a pretty difficult time. But if it's most models other than that? A few profiles here, a little disinformation there, and you're in good shape.
20:51:04 <cx2[m]> Running GOS with iPhone as a backup.
20:51:04 <cx2[m]> I use encrypted email, but also have a fastmail account as you can literally create a seperate email alias  for every single interaction forwhich email is needed.... and thats not even getting into anonaddy and the like.
20:54:22 <cdesai> using an entirely separate email alias is fun at times
20:54:30 <cdesai> especially if you do it like company⊙yt
20:54:45 <cdesai> I've had somebody ask me once if I created an entire email account just for them
20:55:12 <JTL> cdesai: heh

20:55:45 <jacksonpollock19> <cx2[m] "jacksonpollock1993: you can requ"> I can imagine mate.
20:56:16 <JTL> ALthough I can imagine if the alias is human readable/name of service a email marketer/spammer using a DB dump could tell "oh this is the name of a service" and come up with potential aliases for spam that way
20:56:19 <cx2[m]> <cdesai "I've had somebody ask me once if"> To which I would reply, "Absolutely not, this is my primary email that i use iwth eeeeeveryone..."
20:57:18 <JTL> And I've heard claims that random email aliases can help stall social engineering attacks with some vendors.
20:57:35 <cdesai> cx2[m]: good one, I'm gonna save that for later
20:57:55 <cdesai> JTL: true, I've been concerned about that. maybe I should try adding some random seed words instead of something completely random
20:58:15 <cdesai> like applefruit@ for apple perhaps
21:00:26 <cx2[m]> <JTL "And I've heard claims that rando"> I don't know that social engineering is the correct verbiage. But it would stand to reason that by using a seperate email address for everything you do could significally limit link analysis from one service to another.
21:01:01 <cdesai> at some point they could start filtering by domain names though
21:01:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> And mild security-through-obscurity. Even using username+servicename⊙yc helps with this.
21:01:39 <JTL> That's true, but see past customer service "backdoors" used for account changes/recovery at Amazon/AWS, Apple, GoDaddy (don't use them at any cost, it's not 2010 anymore), etc.
21:01:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If you know iCloud has a Find My Phone API with no rate limiting...but you don't know I'm using username+icloud23989878432⊙mc, you're at minimum going to need a bit to figure things out
21:02:02 <cx2[m]> fastmail has something in the neighborhood of 200 domain names
21:02:07 <DannyWorkOrderPr> If you can at all.
21:02:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > If you know iCloud has a Find My Phone API with no rate limiting

21:06:26 <cdesai> it shows up as nother message
21:06:35 <cdesai> another*
21:07:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> woof. Sry. thx.
21:07:08 <cdesai> long messages show up as links, and multiple edits to long messages lead to multiple links
21:07:30 <cdesai> quotes/replies also only show up partially, but most of the times the context is enough
21:30:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. IRC considers any message that's multiple lines to be long.
21:31:44 <TheJollyRoger> I have to admit usually I don't really read them... >_>
21:32:07 <TheJollyRoger> Sometimes if they're addressed to me I wget them and cat them out but often times I just scroll past them.

21:37:38 <TheJollyRoger> (Also, if it's not needed, could you not use multiline unless you really have to? Most of the time I don't bother looking at links from Matrix)
21:38:22 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: switch your phone off, then hold the "Volume Down" key and "Power" key until fastboot comes on.
21:38:54 <TheJollyRoger> then try fastboot devices

22:41:27 <shiver> let's just write an IRC bot that fetches the link and sends the matrix messages as irc messages
22:41:35 <shiver> l0l
22:41:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahahaha
22:41:43 <TheJollyRoger> Perfect.
22:42:54 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <shiver "let's just write an IRC bot that"> Yeah, that'd work. Since we're on the topic, does responding to a message in Matrix make it shitty in IRC?

22:43:33 <shiver> idk if you consider that "shitty"
22:44:26 <cdesai> I find this bit acceptable tbh
22:44:36 <shiver> also i was joking it should be fixed at the matrix relay level
22:44:51 <shiver> yeah it's not that bad cdesai
22:45:12 <shiver> i wrote an IRC relay for another protocol and it does similar
22:45:17 <shiver> except it's two lines
22:45:31 <shiver> <someone> something something something
22:45:34 <shiver> my message
22:45:35 <shiver> like that

22:46:30 <limitless0[m]> Anyone knows if its ok to give permission?
22:46:42 <limitless0[m]> Its just an alp for haptic feedback
22:46:57 <limitless0[m]> App*
22:47:48 <limitless0[m]> Has no permissions other than sensors,no internet nor storage
22:52:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <shiver "idk if you consider that "shitty"> Nah, that's much better than I expected, actually. Okay, cool. Thanks!
