01:16:11 <Btc> Anyone know of any possible devices for grapheneos that isn't owned by google
01:40:48 <nickcalyx[m]> btc not at this time, that I know of.  there used to be support for these hikey development boards I think ? but I don't think that exists any more, and that's probably not what you meant anyway
02:31:19 <jneplokh> <Btc "Anyone know of any possible devi"> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
02:31:31 <jneplokh> Please read through the site and irc logs before asking here
03:49:37 <smallandbig> hello
03:49:49 <smallandbig> what is the note app that you guys using
04:09:35 <nikitalita[m]> https://f-droid.org/packages/com.standardnotes/
04:09:36 <nikitalita[m]> oh he left
04:09:37 <nikitalita[m]> oh well
04:18:08 <jneplokh> <nikitalita[m] "https://f-droid.org/packages/com"> Worth pointing out the F-Droid package is behind
04:18:11 <jneplokh> https://github.com/standardnotes/mobile/releases/
04:25:46 <aeonsolution[m]> you should just install it directly from StandardNotes website
04:26:28 <jneplokh> Oh, didn't even know that was an option
04:26:38 <jneplokh> For those who didn't either: https://standardnotes.org/download/android
04:28:57 <SECLUDED-M3[m]> "jacob" (https://matrix.to/#/@jacob:matrix.jnep.xyz)  Joplin is also better option
04:29:39 <jneplokh> To each their own (or use both), but this might be off-topic so I do not want to go there, in this channel at least :)
05:20:59 <sixBit[m]> Does it make sense / do you use orboot in combination with a VPN?
06:47:33 <riotuser1993[m]> If I was buying a pixel today,
06:47:33 <riotuser1993[m]> Pixel 3A or Pixel 4 for Graphene?
06:47:33 <riotuser1993[m]> 3A only has a year or so left of updates and the 4 is experimental
06:50:28 <theultron[m]> 4 is not that experimental. People are running it stability here with GOS.
06:50:51 <theultron[m]>  * 4 is not that experimental. People are running it stably here with GOS.
06:51:18 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> If there is enough resources, 4(XL).
06:51:18 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Btw, 3a has 20 months of support left
06:51:33 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * If there is enough resources, 4(XL).
06:51:33 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Btw, 3a has 19 to 20 months of support left
06:51:39 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * If there is enough resources, 4(XL).
06:51:39 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Btw, 3a(XL) has 19 to 20 months of support left
06:55:31 <riotuser1993[m]> So the 4 is pretty stable? And the 3a has just under 2 years ..
06:55:31 <riotuser1993[m]> So basically it doesn't make a difference either will be fine
06:56:55 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * If there is enough resources, 4(XL), 25 to 26 months left.
06:56:55 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Btw, 3a(XL) has 19 to 20 months of support left
07:31:43 <_12> hello, not sure if this issue is graphene-specific but quite recently my AOSP dialer no longer works and immediately ends any call i try to make
07:32:00 <_12> i can still send/receive text and use mobile data
07:32:28 <_12> tried toggling airplane mode/rebooting but that hasn't solved the issue, anyone else experienced this?
07:33:28 <_12> using latest grapheneOS as well on pixel 3a
07:44:37 <_12> nvm, managed to solve it. apparently my carrier doesn't seem to support LTE only mode through voice very well
07:46:52 <djee737ejdd[m]> madaidan.: just wanted to say - awesome work with https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/index.html with good sources to help stop the misconceptions about security and explain why GrapheneOS use Chromium and why GrapheneOS is superior to LineageOS if you care about security too.

08:29:20 <hultan[m]> Any recommendation for a good Email client in f-droid or aurora? I don't need calendar and everything, so simple is ok...
08:30:11 <hultan[m]> I am currently trying K-9 mail, but it seems to require manual checks for new mails
08:40:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> thematten: if you find any let me know
08:45:13 <trismous[m]> <hultan[m] "I am currently trying K-9 mail, "> AFAIK there is an option for automatic check
08:45:35 <theultron[m]> What do you guys use Download Manager on Android for? I noticed that Bromite & F-Droid uses their inbuilt download manager.
08:46:01 <theultron[m]> I block network access of the Download Manager.
08:47:08 <hackerman[m]> Built in. You should always use onboard tools instead of adding attack surface.
08:47:56 <theultron[m]> I assume most here are already using Bromite/Vanadium or F-Droid.
08:47:59 <hultan[m]> trismous: I have been looking, but now I looked again and found one that seemed to do just that immediately :-)
08:48:29 <theultron[m]> <hackerman[m] "Built in. You should always use "> Built in download manager is exploited more. You also don't need to give storage permission now. SAF rocks!
08:49:34 <hultan[m]> trismous:  I feel that the default option, to never check, is bad though...anyway, changed it to every minute or so now....
08:51:11 <trismous[m]> <hultan[m] "trismous:  I feel that the defau"> That is up to the dev to decide. Maybe they wanted to save battery?
08:52:03 <hultan[m]> trismous: true, I will change it to every 5 minutes instead...
08:58:21 <dazinism> <hultan[m] "trismous: true, I will change it"> I have k9 set to check manually. I like not being nagged by emails. The longer you set the check interval the better the battery performance. Have to wake the phone up from Doze and do the network check, which eats into battery life.
08:59:07 <dazinism> You'd notice 5 min, but 30 min checks not so much.
11:02:00 <brenneke[m]> <hultan[m] "Any recommendation for a good Em"> Have been using Aquamail for many years and love it....bought it back when it was a ~$10 one time fee.

12:33:39 <sixBit[m]> <hultan[m] "Any recommendation for a good Em"> Take a look at FairMail. And preferably download the apk file straight from GitHub.
13:25:47 <strcat[m]> djee737ejdd: AOSP does not have an Updater app (other than a sample one) so it doesn't support serialno constraints
13:25:50 <strcat[m]> that text says Android updates CAN support them not that it does
13:25:55 <strcat[m]> please read carefully
13:27:01 <strcat[m]> and you seem to completely misunderstand what it does
13:28:17 <strcat[m]> if an update has a serialno constraint, it's either supposed to be rejected outright or rejected on devices without that serialno
13:28:41 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS rejects them outright for OTA updates
13:30:01 <strcat[m]> it is an optional feature
13:30:03 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't have a production Updater app, just a sample app, and their sample app doesn't support serialno constraints AFAIK
13:30:07 <strcat[m]> the purpose of the feature is probably so that a debug build can be shipped over-the-air and if leaked it wouldn't be possible to install it elsewhere
13:30:08 <strcat[m]> and they could add a similar check built into the OS
13:30:14 <strcat[m]> it is not really useful to us in any way
16:11:09 <djee737ejdd[m]> strcat: Thank you
17:08:43 <pulse35> hello guys
17:09:14 <pulse35> i have pixel 4 with Calyxos now thinking of flashing GrapheneOS what is the advantages in doing so
17:12:28 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Security features and enhancements
17:12:29 <droshi[m]> dazinism: you mentioned a light safer version of microg designed just to fool google camera, can you give a link to that or more info?
17:12:36 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also, network + sensor permissions
17:12:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> 16 users + 64 passwords
17:13:16 <pulse35> ok za_vilfp8kn0pcyh so you recommend the change
17:13:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> You can search more at logs or see at FAQ in grapheneos.org
17:14:10 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> well, if you don't need any apps with hard dependency on microG or play services, yes
17:14:50 <pulse35> right now what i'm using for is phone calls , email , documents, sms
17:15:14 <pulse35> web browsing
17:15:37 <pulse35> i can't think of any thing else maps sometimes when i get lost
17:16:47 <pulse35> can i  personalize the home screen and colors in graphene
17:17:43 <droshi[m]> a lot of what you may use depends on for example which email, but all of those things can be done on graphene without google play services
17:18:19 <droshi[m]> also depends exactly how nicely each app works, for me i evaluated for example several email clients before deciding which i would use
17:19:16 <droshi[m]> same thing for example on cloud storage with auto-uploading from camera, many "work", some work better and actually upload without needing to launch the app first
17:26:15 <pulse35> i don't care about backup
17:26:18 <pulse35> or camera at all
17:26:51 <pulse35> any email app will work for me i can use outlook , fairmail, or k9 all the same to me
17:26:58 <pulse35> proton mail
17:27:36 <pulse35> i'm not a tech person
17:28:25 <pulse35> maybe battery life is something i care about
17:28:45 <pulse35> add block for web browser
17:29:05 <pulse35> those two are my biggest need
17:29:35 <pulse35> any note taking or task app will do
17:33:35 <droshi[m]> protonmail didn't work that well for me, no notifications, i ended up in tutanota FWIW
17:34:21 <droshi[m]> i'd suggest just picking a free weekend...backup everything on your phone, try out graphene and get what you need going or get replacements, and if it doesn't work out you can always flash back
17:35:02 <droshi[m]> i did that and haven't gone back yet, i don't think i will, camera is the only last thing i'd like to solve but isn't a huge deal for me
17:35:20 <pulse35> l don't have anything to backup
17:35:42 <pulse35> just contacts and i have them  on a file already
17:35:54 <droshi[m]> i hear Adobe is working on a camera similar to Gcam, maybe that'll be worth looking at, depending on how data collection is
17:36:17 <pulse35> just was wondering if the green color on top of the screen will go with graphene
17:36:34 <pulse35> guys on calyx say it's refresh rate related
17:36:51 <pulse35> do i need to go back to stock before i flash graphene from calyx
17:37:08 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> How to check if an app has accessed clipboard?
17:37:12 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> is it only by adb?
17:42:45 <pulse35> sorry i have very very very limited info
17:43:14 <pulse35> i still don't know to block ads on graphene or even how to findchromium
17:47:58 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "i still don't know to block ads "> Use something like dns.adguard.com in Settings > Network and Internet > Private DNS > Manual > dns.adguard.com
17:48:24 <Vicarious[m]> * Use something like dns.adguard.com in Settings > Network and Internet > Private DNS > Private DNS provider hostname > dns.adguard.com
17:48:26 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <pulse35 "i still don't know to block ads "> On GrapheneOS, Vanadium is the Chromium built in app
17:48:50 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "How to check if an app has acces"> Asking in the whole room btw
17:50:09 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "just was wondering if the green "> What phone do you have?
17:50:46 <pulse35> pixel 4 is what i'm using .on calyx there is this appps orbot, tor browser, csrambled exif,mupdf ,loactionprivacy ,DAVx5
17:50:57 <pulse35> calyxvpn
17:51:11 <pulse35> not sure if they are useful or i will ever use
17:51:53 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "pixel 4 is what i'm using .on ca"> I use most of those apps on GrapheneOS.
17:52:50 <pulse35> i never use them i'm just having them from sartup instal
17:55:36 <Vicarious[m]> pulse35  in relation to the green flickering, Pixel 4 and 4XL devices have been known to have had incorrect gamma calibration at the factory at 90hz. If you try "Battery Saver" (which puts the device into 60hz mode), the green screen should go... Can you check that?
17:55:36 <Vicarious[m]> However, you CAN force 60hz all the time using an ADB command. It isn't necessarily recommended to do ADB commands as they *could* compromise security, but if you want to not have a green screen and/or flickering, this is the way to go.
17:57:56 <Vicarious[m]> When I mean 60hz mode, I mean battery saving mode and the screen is also set to 60hz.
17:58:19 <pulse35> i think battery saver mode helped
17:59:41 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "i think battery saver mode helpe"> That's good. That means the ADB commands would work if you want to force 60hz all the time, instead of 90hz.
17:59:48 <Vicarious[m]> could work*
18:01:04 <pulse35> i think i will make the jump
18:01:28 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "i think i will make the jump"> To GrapheneOS?
18:02:15 <Vicarious[m]> You still may experience the green flickering / hue. Just warning you, just in case your expectations are high.
18:03:09 <pulse35> i know but people say it's more secure
18:03:10 <LowValueTarget> i have a new 4 xl coming in today to replace my note 10+
18:03:35 <LowValueTarget> all in for grapheneos -- bought retail without trying out graphene first
18:03:49 <LowValueTarget> but i like to tinker so we'll see how it goes
18:04:09 <pulse35> i can't go to fastboot
18:04:22 <pulse35> it comes for 1 second and then start the mobile
18:04:37 <pulse35> i enabled boot unlock and usb debug
18:04:58 <Vicarious[m]> Nice one, LowValueTarget
18:06:02 <pulse35> i close the phone then start it with power and lower but it doesn't want to stay in fastboot menu to more than one sec
18:06:07 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "i can't go to fastboot"> Power + Volume Down. Try again.
18:06:36 <Vicarious[m]> Okay no worries.
18:06:45 <pulse35> same one sec and then phone starts
18:07:38 <Vicarious[m]> In CalyxOS, with USB debugging on, assuming you've got ADB and Fastboot set up on your computer, open a terminal or PowerShell and type  "adb reboot bootloader"
18:08:00 <Vicarious[m]> See if that works for you.
18:09:01 <pulse35> that worked
18:11:06 <Vicarious[m]> Just remember, you will lose all data on your phone, so if anything isn't backed up... Back it up first.
18:13:40 <pulse35> flashing
18:30:06 <pulse35> i  notice  instnat enhance on flickering
18:32:48 <Vicarious[m]> Right, enable USB Debugging
18:33:23 <Vicarious[m]> And then do...
18:33:33 <Vicarious[m]> adb shell settings put system min_refresh_rate 60
18:33:41 <Vicarious[m]> adb shell settings put system peak_refresh_rate 60
18:33:53 <Vicarious[m]> pulse35 do what I just said. This might stop the flickering for you.
18:34:10 <Vicarious[m]> Then disable USB debugging.
18:35:01 <pulse35> it's already better on graphene os
18:39:14 <pulse35> i will try black back groud
18:42:17 <bbqcore[m]> hows Android 11 coming along?
18:42:24 <pulse35> only thig i hate the update check doesn't tell you if you are up to date or no
18:42:30 <bbqcore[m]> Will it be Graphenes Sept update?
18:42:55 <pulse35> and no personalizing , like calyx for colors and icons and grid
18:43:39 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Depends if AOSP releases it alongaise
18:44:00 <bbqcore[m]> I'm assuming an early Sept release
18:44:05 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Depends if AOSP is released it alongside
18:44:17 <bbqcore[m]> I remember Android 10 was really fast on Graphene
18:44:27 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Depends if AOSP is released alongside stock Android R
18:46:21 <bbqcore[m]> OK I'm sure Daniel has been working on it and has a better idea
18:46:34 <droshi[m]> is there any way to block apps from accessing or seeing you have installed other apps?
18:46:52 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> None until Android R (maybe)
18:47:12 <bbqcore[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "None until Android R (maybe)"> can you explain?
18:47:43 <pulse35> the green on the top comes back as soon i use black wallpaper
18:47:50 <bbqcore[m]> As in no need for separate user profiles to sandbox certain apps?
18:48:53 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-11#privacy
18:49:00 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <bbqcore[m] "As in no need for separate user "> Nope.

18:50:58 <bbqcore[m]> Looking for a way to run whatsapp without another user profile
18:51:27 <pulse35> sorry for asking may i ask for my learning what are you trying to do with whats app
18:51:30 <Vicarious[m]> <pulse35 "the green on the top comes back "> Yes, it will. Do what I said above to disable 90hz and you will no longer have any flickering.
18:51:44 <pulse35> it might be useful for me
18:51:48 <bbqcore[m]> Talk to girls
18:52:09 <pulse35> i mean to do with what;s app in graphene as security
18:52:19 <pulse35> '=D
18:52:28 <bbqcore[m]> I want to use whatsapp sandboxed
18:52:38 <pulse35> @vicarious will use your advice
18:53:17 <bbqcore[m]> so any security issued are cant get the whole system or other apps
18:53:51 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <bbqcore[m] "As in no need for separate user "> Just to clarify, the only way to prevent interapplication communication, although each apps is sandboxed, is by user profiles.
18:55:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> This will also prevent the app to see what apps are installed on other profiles, and will only see what apps are installed on that profile as of Android Q
18:56:08 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * This will also prevent the app to see what apps are installed on other profiles, and will only see what apps are installed on that (same) profile (it was installed) as of Android Q
18:58:51 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Downside is, for tighter isolation, there is no notification until you go to that profile
18:59:46 <bbqcore[m]> ok looks like user profile is the only way to go
19:01:09 <pulse35> may i ask what apps do you use guys , for opening docks , note taking , and what other essintail apps i must have affter flashing graphene
19:01:41 <pulse35> is brave browser any good
19:02:49 <droshi[m]> i would suggest using the built-in vanadium browser
19:03:29 <pulse35> ok
19:03:32 <pulse35> will do so
19:03:41 <droshi[m]> though it has trackers, you could check out the Island app, i don't know if there's a FOSS alternative, or how good Island is bbqcore
19:04:02 <pulse35> what else is a must to have after flashing
19:04:27 <pulse35> and for documents , notes, tasks
19:06:23 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Vanadium is more up-to-date than Brave
19:06:24 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also, it isn't recommended generally to sacrifice security and ownership of phone (thru device admin) just for some convenience of dual apps.
19:06:25 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Auditor checks for that, by the way. Gotta do auditor and auditee scanning before installing anything...
19:06:42 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Vanadium is more up-to-date than Brave
19:06:43 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also, it isn't recommended generally to sacrifice security and ownership of phone (thru device admin) just for some convenience of dual apps (referring to Island or Shelter). Better off using that profile isolation
19:08:48 <pulse35> does vandium support htpps every where
19:09:14 <pulse35> it might be a naive questions but this my level in tech info
19:15:50 <droshi[m]> @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io: notifications don't go across profile isolation right? i see options to share call/text history
19:18:29 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> No extension support for Vanadium.
19:18:32 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also, call and text sharing is for online and built in app iirc
19:18:53 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <pulse35 "does vandium support htpps every"> If you mean native, you can still open http
19:19:15 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> It'll be problematic if it can't especially on wifi captive portals or something
19:19:21 <pulse35> i mean i hear it's important to try to make only https for security
19:19:57 <pulse35> i used to have this app called @voice aloud reader
19:20:39 <pulse35> it read my pdf files and makes them like a audio book Text to speech reader
19:20:49 <pulse35> any idea what can  i use on graphene
19:21:20 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Maybe it could work, if you need it
19:22:13 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <pulse35 "i mean i hear it's important to "> It is, that's why type links always on https
19:22:24 <pulse35> ok
19:22:32 <pulse35> it worked the voicer reaser
19:28:16 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <droshi[m] "@za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:pr"> Offline calls and texts, probably, can't speak for that fully
19:46:50 <droshi[m]> thanks, yeah from a bit of testing, you don't seem to get notifications when in a different profile
19:47:20 <droshi[m]> it's a good solution though for me for right now to use gcam
21:30:57 <nate48423> denaro and the american government is getting my human brain and i go through things like no sleep, not comprehending, changing taste of food. please tell your world leaders i dont want amaerica to get my human brain and its serious terrorism going on in the country with denaro chips inside of people
21:55:10 <LowValueTarget> Anyone had an issue before where oem unlocking is not available
21:55:20 <LowValueTarget> I bought a brand new pixel 4 xl from amazon (shipped and sold by)
21:55:30 <LowValueTarget> the OEM unlock is greyed out
21:55:35 <LowValueTarget> first boot
21:56:35 <M0xC0ncord[m]> LowValueTarget: Go here: https://store.google.com/us/repaircenter
21:56:36 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Then enter your IEMI or serial number. If the Pixel that gets displayed says anything with "Verizon" in it, you can't unlock it.
21:56:41 <LowValueTarget> nevermind-- it has to be connected to the internet
21:56:45 <M0xC0ncord[m]> And there's nothing you can do other than return it
21:56:56 <M0xC0ncord[m]> (or don't use GrapheneOS)
21:56:59 <LowValueTarget> once i connected to my wifi the unlocking was available
