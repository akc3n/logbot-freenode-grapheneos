00:29:48 <BrokenCog> hellos.  I'm having a problem at the build#browser-and-webview step of the build instructions.  Specifically, "gclient sync -D --with_branch_heads -r $VERSION --jobs 32" never seems to end!  any idea how to dewtermine if it's finished correctly?
00:30:21 <aeonsolution[m]> did you replace $VERSION?
00:30:26 <BrokenCog> yes.
00:30:44 <BrokenCog> VERSION=android-10.0.0_r35
00:31:35 <aeonsolution[m]> the version comes from https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/blob/10/args.gn
00:33:14 <BrokenCog> ah. page says "Sync to the latest stable release for Android" ... so, the args.gn file has a "version_name" and a "version_code" ... which does this expect?
00:34:02 <aeonsolution[m]> i made a guess and used version_name, but i could be wrong
00:34:17 <aeonsolution[m]> i ran the command and it worked for me so far
00:34:47 <BrokenCog> okay.  I chose that as well, we'll see how it goes
00:35:11 <BrokenCog> what about the pervious git checkout $CORRECT_BRANCH_OR_TAG
00:35:16 <BrokenCog> what tag did you use for that?
00:35:36 <aeonsolution[m]> i believe thats a variable from a script
00:35:47 <BrokenCog> lol.  which script?
00:35:52 <aeonsolution[m]> i could be wrong for that one too
00:36:29 <aeonsolution[m]> i didnt try looking
00:36:49 <aeonsolution[m]> im trusting the Official instructions
00:36:54 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: is there a reason why you'd like to pm me/
00:37:24 <aeonsolution[m]> hey renlord, sorry for the spam; Riot updates made the private message bug out
00:37:36 <aeonsolution[m]> it was creating rooms when i tried reaching out
00:37:53 <aeonsolution[m]>  * hey renlord, sorry for the spam; Riot's update made the private message bug out
00:38:01 <renlord> no prob
00:40:19 <JTL> BrokenCog: Last time I did this I used the value from android_default_version_name and that seemed to work
00:40:26 <JTL> s/from/of
00:41:05 <JTL> Should be more clear in the docs though
00:41:10 <BrokenCog> okay.  I'll use that, but I'm still not sure which "CORRECT_BRANCH_TAG" to do the git checkout to.
00:41:52 <aeonsolution[m]> i think its a reference to the build your setting up
00:42:00 <aeonsolution[m]> for me it was graphene-10
00:42:04 <JTL> BrokenCog: follows the GrapheneOS manifest tag
00:42:07 <BrokenCog> ah, the qq2a build number?
00:42:20 <JTL> That'll work
00:42:20 <BrokenCog> or the chromium 18.... build number?
00:42:25 <JTL> the former
00:43:37 <JTL> For the Vanadium repository, the CORRECT_BRANCH_TAG is either `10` (for development purposes) or the build number (for a production build)
00:44:35 <BrokenCog> okay.
00:46:15 <BrokenCog> any idea how long this 'fetch' takes?
00:46:35 <aeonsolution[m]> depends on your connection
00:46:44 <BrokenCog> of course.
00:46:47 <aeonsolution[m]> more than 5 mins
00:46:55 <BrokenCog> is it 5G? 10? 100G?
00:47:02 <JTL> Let me check
00:47:05 <aeonsolution[m]> less than an hour for me
00:47:08 <JTL> It's big
00:47:34 <BrokenCog> I added the --no-history, hopefully that reduces it a bit.
00:49:24 <BrokenCog> sadly gclient doesn't seem to want to pass --depth to git.
00:49:33 <BrokenCog> don't really need the entire history.
00:50:09 <JTL> BrokenCog: with defualt settings my latest clone of Chromium (81.0.4044.96) came out to 43GB
00:50:19 <BrokenCog> jeebus.
00:50:35 <JTL> Sure is nice having an "office" with good internet :p
00:50:46 <BrokenCog> :).
00:50:48 <JTL> But yeah it's an issue for some folks
00:51:45 <renlord> chromium also takes longer to build than grapheneos
00:51:47 <renlord> lol
00:52:05 <JTL> ^^
00:52:13 <JTL> It's why Google made ChromiumOS /s
01:03:14 <renlord> what is this 'smart city plan' for toronto
01:03:17 <renlord> that just got ended
01:03:27 <renlord> every news article is so ambigious on it
01:04:41 <JTL> My understanding is it's a bunch of IoT sensors and related things with a scable database and data processing attached to it
01:05:00 <JTL> That's my ELI5 explanation if I were to give one
01:05:10 <JTL> But I'm not in Ontario and only vaguely read over it
01:11:36 <BrokenCog> curious how "tech" and "green" always go hand in hand.  "tech" is one of the least (as an aggregate) green thing on the planet.  between power usage, resource extraction, transportation etc.  granted it's helpful, it's the mythical universal equation of tech leading to green which I'm commenting on.
01:12:23 <JTL> Probably things like power saving and some marketing like "conflict free materials"
01:12:30 <seaclown> There is a portion to the east of downtown that was historically Portland's/industrial and is going through redevelopment. They had a
01:12:46 <JTL> Power saving as in compared to older electronics
01:12:49 <JTL> lol
01:13:44 <seaclown> Submitted a proposal that was being discussed with the local govt for it to be tech intensive
01:13:54 <aeonsolution[m]> hey JTL , I ran the ninja command and got this error:

01:15:33 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: You just gotten by the Python versioning "bug" :p
01:15:57 <JTL> Seems some of the Chromium build system still requires Python 2
01:16:05 <aeonsolution[m]> -_____-
01:16:26 <aeonsolution[m]> let me work on that; thanks for pointing that out
01:16:43 <TheJollyRoger> Got the test results from the cts test cases. Results coming up.
01:17:23 <JTL> hitchhooker[m]: Looks like aeonsolution[m] also got bitten by the Python version bug :p
01:17:28 <TheJollyRoger> These results were really good, only unfortunately my phone has been left with two admin apps that for some reason the phone is saying is "not installed for this user" and I can't seem to purge them from this list. I may have uninstalled them in the incorrect order.
01:18:37 <aeonsolution[m]> at least i got this far with python3 lol
01:54:22 <miniblue[m]> So Keybase was just bought by Zoom? Is that right?
01:54:28 <JTL> Yes
01:54:45 <JTL> Or as I like to call it "A PGP keyserver with the kichen sink bolted on after"
01:55:17 <miniblue[m]> Never used it (Signal, Briar, Riot for me) but sucks for those who didn't.
01:55:20 <miniblue[m]> Ah yes
01:55:37 <miniblue[m]> *who did
01:56:32 <miniblue[m]> If I'm not mistaken it was kind of a security mess, no?
01:56:46 <JTL> Well buggy Electron app, so kinda
01:57:01 <JTL> And it had it's own cryptostorm seperate from GPG
01:57:29 <miniblue[m]> I see. Still a shame. I'm sure it had some usefulness.
01:57:42 <TheJollyRoger> Cue some jokes here about gpg over Zoom? :P
01:57:57 <miniblue[m]> oh god
01:58:27 <TheJollyRoger> I'd have to go see if libgcrypt runs its cryptographic operations in constant-time...
02:06:38 <miniblue[m]> Is there any functionality or plans to implement any functionality in regards to a "wipe on x failed passcode attempts" type thing? It's not really important and is more of a QoL thing but I was just wondering if that was possible.
02:08:10 <miniblue[m]> Though I would assume features of that type would come later in the project with more devs and more time, if it's not complete security theatre, that is.
02:08:29 <JTL> I think a hardware implementation would be much better but not possible with current Pixel hardware
02:08:41 <TheJollyRoger> miniblue[m]: I got a writeup for you on that actually.
02:08:51 <JTL> and I discussed this with TheJollyRoger awhile ago
02:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> miniblue[m]: https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/GrapheneOS-Security-Q%26A.md#does-graphene-allow-me-to-nuke-my-data-if-say-the-phone-gets-ten-incorrect-guesses-at-the-pincode It's sorta not really needed anymore.
02:10:17 <TheJollyRoger> The reason why Apple and BlackBerry did it was because of the limitations of enclave processors at the time, so they took the sledgehammer approach.
02:10:45 <miniblue[m]> Oh wow. Interesting.
02:11:27 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. The TLDR of it is that it's mostly security theatre and presents a highly dangerous Denial of Availability exploits.
02:11:34 <TheJollyRoger> *a highly dangerous Denial of Availability exploit
02:12:06 <JTL> I could see adding it being potentially valid assuming those caveats are documented, but adding it to the OS without being back by hardware seems kind of pointless to me
02:12:38 <JTL> backed*
02:13:16 <madaidan[m]> It would be useful for those paranoid, crazy people
02:13:20 <TheJollyRoger> As I understand it (Don't take my word for this) the way that it used to be done on Apple's older iPhones was that the four digit pincode was combined with a unique ID generated within the processor that the processor wouldn't allow extraction of, along with possibly some other keying information.
02:15:13 <TheJollyRoger> miniblue[m]: since those older handsets didn't have an internal timer that was separate from the clock, they had no way of measuring time, so as a result this was something of a kludgy way for them to deter brute force attacks /provided/ the attacker went through the operating system.
02:15:39 <miniblue[m]> TheJollyRoger: Fantastic writeup, thank you. That makes complete sense.
02:15:43 <TheJollyRoger> This is why that feature exists, and this is why as JTL said, it will only be useful if you have a hardware binding on it.
02:15:50 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime :). What I'm here for!
02:17:22 <miniblue[m]> I assume Apple has better hardware security now and doesn't need the feature but leaves it for the purposes of security theater and/or because it's difficult to remove? I'm guessing?
02:17:57 <TheJollyRoger> I unfortunately know very little about the newer Apple Handsets, so unfortunately I can't help you there :(.
02:18:51 <TheJollyRoger> Just that that was how it was /thought to have been done/ on the older iPhone 5C.
02:19:03 <TheJollyRoger> I can't confirm that either, unfortunately.
02:19:43 <miniblue[m]> I see. Because if that isn't the case then that is a major security risk and is, IMO, really poorly designed.
02:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> But, what I can confirm is that yes, the "nuke" feature is resultant of the limitations of the hardware at that time. Why it's not gone away... I'm not sure. Perhaps people are more comfortable with knowing it's there...? I dunno.
02:20:31 <miniblue[m]> I would imagine they have better security chips nowadays.
02:20:56 <miniblue[m]> Yeah probably advertising/security theater honestly.
02:21:07 <miniblue[m]> Who knows what they're thinking
02:21:20 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
02:26:22 <TheJollyRoger> After about 650 years, I kinda wonder if the phone would still even be alive. By that point, electromigration might have simply stripped all the conductor out of the CPU and essentially kill the unit.
02:26:37 <TheJollyRoger> Er, out of the HSM's CPU
02:27:41 <TheJollyRoger> I wouldn't count on the solid state memory where the access tokens are stored to last longer than maybe a couple decades.
02:38:26 <mxnorvak[m]> Just to report back, Twidere works almost fine as a twitter client, sometimes has problem loading order tweets and dms
02:39:25 <TheJollyRoger> Oh fantastic.
02:39:35 <mxnorvak[m]> I liked the offical twitter app more tho
02:40:01 <mxnorvak[m]> Idk if its work making a new profile to have only twitter on it
02:40:46 <mxnorvak[m]> I already have 2 other profiles for 2 shady apps, one for each
02:43:19 <mxnorvak[m]> Its a pain switching between profiles but the upside has been as I'm annoyed by constantly changing profiles, i don't do it that often and spend less time with my phone xD
02:43:40 <mxnorvak[m]> Idk if its worth*
04:09:14 <brenneke[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Just to report back, Twidere wor"> Personally found it flaky as hell, just use Bromite now.
04:25:32 <k-sloth[m]> For Graphene what VPN should I use? Wirrguard?
04:32:06 <mxnorvak[m]> <brenneke[m] "Personally found it flaky as hel"> Well yeah its not as smooth as the offical app,how's the PWA version been like?
04:47:51 <zxwayland> hey, what is there to do on grapheneos?
04:51:27 <vzlcn0[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
04:51:27 <vzlcn0[m]> > hey, what is there to do on grapheneos?
04:52:28 <zxwayland> i am used to being on youtube and playing mobile games on it
04:52:38 <zxwayland> (old android phone)
05:03:49 <brenneke[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "Well yeah its not as smooth as t"> Pardon my Twitter ignorance, not sure what PWA is. Fenix app was my favourite but does not work for me on GrapheneOS. I just go to Twitter in Bromite, log in then add to home screen. Is that PWA? Very solid but does require a few minor workarounds.
05:05:45 <mxnorvak[m]> <brenneke[m] "Pardon my Twitter ignorance, not"> Yeah as far as i know that's PWA, how about being signed to multiple accounts at once,does that work?
05:07:30 <mxnorvak[m]> haven't used Fenix, is it a client for Twitter?
05:09:35 <mxnorvak[m]> Yeah just checked it, seems nice but needs to be purchased
05:11:08 <mxnorvak[m]> Has anyone used Nitter for Twitter?
05:15:31 <mxnorvak[m]> WebApps Sandboxed Browser (Sandbox for webapps) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.tobykurien.webapps
05:15:56 <mxnorvak[m]> This also seems to be an option but idk how good their sandbox is
05:32:55 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: by 'sandbox' they just mean running them in the WebView
05:54:11 <mxnorvak[m]> Oh
05:55:05 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "mxnorvak: by 'sandbox' they just"> what's your preferred way of using twitter on mobile?
06:10:38 <renlord[m]> I just use vanadium.
06:33:55 <fujita_[m]> Noob question: is it possible to paste using clipboard from 2 different user account or will I have to set up a separate  password manager file on the 2nd user account
06:34:26 <strcat[m]> you can't share data between user profiles
06:34:56 <fujita_[m]> Thanks
06:34:56 <strcat[m]> you would have to do it over the network
06:35:18 <fujita_[m]> What do you mean by that?
06:35:36 <fujita_[m]> Does keepassdx has that function?
06:48:24 <mxnorvak[m]> <renlord[m] "I just use vanadium. "> Would twitter know which sites I'm accessing on other tabs? I guess this is where the chromium sandbox comes into play
08:33:41 <dazinism> mxnorvak: not sure if how Twitter do it, but certainly Facebook did (and I expect still do)
08:34:49 <dazinism> Facebook used copyright of their 'F' logo so that any site that wanted a share on Facebook button had to use their widget
08:36:20 <dazinism> That widget would have code which reported your visit ro the site
08:36:46 <dazinism> Adding to your Facebook cookie IIRC
08:39:19 <dazinism> Expect any sites that run other Facebook code - like 'login with Facebook' would also be looking for visitors that use that browser for Facebook
08:42:05 <dazinism> Using a different browser to the one you use for twitter would stop that kind of tracking. (Eg. The Webapps Sandboxed Browser)
08:42:43 <dazinism> Used to use twitter via Twidere and was happy with that.
08:44:07 <dazinism> Now I only use and use it via Nitter with JavaScript off
08:44:28 <dazinism> *now I only read and use it
09:09:02 <__oi> is it possible to install google play services on grapheneos?
09:37:21 <strcat[m]> __oi: no, not an actual installation of it - it's not a regular app, it can't just be installed without being integrated into the OS
09:37:35 <strcat[m]> and it replaces a bunch of things that are part of the OS
09:37:56 <strcat[m]> so no, you can't, if you want to integrate Play Services you need your own fork of the OS which is not GrapheneOS
09:45:21 <__oi> i have come across tutorials for installing play services on miui os. or is that something different?
09:46:40 <__oi> the functionality i am interested in is push notifications for the Slack app
09:49:35 <strcat[m]> you can't install it, it has to be built into the OS
09:49:56 <strcat[m]> some Chinese OSes build in support for Play Services without including it - that's not the case with GrapheneOS and will never be
09:50:12 <strcat[m]> Play Services has to be built into the OS, it is not an unprivileged third party app, there is no way around that
09:50:14 <strcat[m]> you can't do it
09:50:28 <strcat[m]> use the stock OS or something else if this is mandatory, you can't use Play Services on GrapheneOS
09:50:55 <__oi> ok, thanks for the answers
09:51:01 <strcat[m]> as I said earlier you would need to fork GrapheneOS to include Play Services if you wanted to do that (and that would not be GrapheneOS anymore)
10:12:24 <k-sloth[m]> <mxnorvak[m] "This also seems to be an option "> i tried it, it was ok but most websites break and you need to enable certain web hostings to unbreak it, i deleted it lol but wasnt bad just not for me
10:31:25 <yekip[m]> dumb question alert.... i haven't tried using profiles yet, but just wondering....
10:31:25 <yekip[m]> Lets say i had 3 profiles with 3 Signal apps installed under different numbers (obviously). Would I need to switch through the profiles to check for messages, or would any incoming msg alerts come through on the main profile?
10:31:36 <mxnorvak[m]> <dazinism "Now I only use and use it via Ni"> Do you use the UntrackMe app for Nitter?
10:31:42 <yekip[m]> kind of assuming thats not possible, but assumption is the mother of all mistakes :)
10:38:10 <shad0wbit[m]> > dumb question alert.... i haven't tried using profiles yet, but just wondering....
10:38:10 <shad0wbit[m]> > Lets say i had 3 profiles with 3 Signal apps installed under different numbers (obviously). Would I need to switch through the profiles to check for messages, or would any incoming msg alerts come through on the main profile?
10:38:10 <shad0wbit[m]> Yes you would need to switch profiles. But you would get an alarm for an incoming call (at least it is so with WhatsApp and with normal calls ).
10:38:17 <shad0wbit[m]> Dunno about Signal
10:40:23 <yekip[m]> thanks, the question is more about profiles than signal really. am i rightg in thinking a profiole is totally isolated so alerts can't come through for any app in one profile, in another profile? such as email alerts or lets say whats app message (if I used that junk!)
10:42:50 <shad0wbit[m]> Notificantions won't come through. So yes they are isolated from each other. You just will hear an alarm of there is an incoming phone call on one of your profiles (and when your alarm clock or a timer sets an alarm)
10:43:04 <shad0wbit[m]> if there
10:45:56 <yekip[m]> you mean will only hear it in the profile the app is running in?
10:46:15 <shad0wbit[m]> No
10:46:20 <shad0wbit[m]> Also in the other
10:54:58 * yekip[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/IHRtPoDuxtRSowKduCagKqSM >
10:56:11 <shad0wbit[m]> There is a diffrence between notification and an alarm/ringtone
10:57:22 <shad0wbit[m]> You won't see notifications. You will only hear a ringtone on profile1 when there is an incoming phone call on profile 2 for example
10:57:57 <yekip[m]> i see. thats kinda cool. thanks!
10:59:06 <yekip[m]> was wondering if there was some kind of app, or IFTT type thing to push something over from one profile tyo another. so if a message came in on profile 2, i would get some kind of notice in profile 1 to tell me to switch across to deal with it. CCTV motion detection alerts in an app, for instance, would be one use for this
10:59:17 <shad0wbit[m]> You can kinda test it if you set a timer for 20 sec. on profile 2 switch to profile 1 and wait until the time of the timer went off
10:59:41 <shad0wbit[m]> But for incoming phone calls it is different from that
10:59:51 <yekip[m]> right yeah
11:00:10 <yekip[m]> not even sure how to set up profiles yet. can't seem to find five mins to do it, day in day out! but soon

11:38:55 <yekip[m]> nice thanks!
11:43:02 <k-sloth[m]> to switch, pull down the notification menu full. you will see a little person icon click that
13:13:43 <yekip[m]> <k-sloth[m] "to switch, pull down the notific"> thanks. so you dont have to actually log out of current user or reboot or anytghing like that?

13:28:25 <yekip[m]> ok thanks.
14:49:34 <dazinism> mxnorvak: yeah, I've got that app.
14:50:24 <dazinism> limitless0 been thinking a bit about your issue not being able to uninstall jami
14:51:10 <dazinism> I've noticed sometimes the OS fails on installs
14:52:07 <dazinism> Thought it was an issue with the Fdroid app, which I mainly use.
14:52:49 <dazinism> Sometimes installs fail depending on where you are in the app. The updates page, from the app page, from the list of apps
14:53:16 <dazinism> Generally I've found trying again, or from somewhere else in the app, works
14:53:32 <dazinism> Guess this is for updates as well as installing.
14:54:11 <dazinism> But I was recently playing with Aurora Droid and found it could fail on installs also.
14:55:51 <dazinism> limitless0 getting more to your situation. Yes you could try via adb
15:04:12 <dazinism> Would expect adb uninstall would work, weird its not working on your device.

15:19:51 <dazinism> You've tried to uninstall from in Fdroid app
15:20:17 <limitless0[m]> I've tried from fdroid ,aurora,system
15:20:25 <limitless0[m]> Only option left is adb now
15:20:47 <dazinism> Yeah
16:24:53 <brenneke[m]> <TheJollyRoger "The reason the Signal APK is dif"> Other than self-updating functionality, do you think the app is the same between web and play apks?
16:35:06 <valldrac> brenneke[m]: there's something more, the web version expires after 90 days
16:36:15 <valldrac> counting from the day the APK was built
16:36:43 <valldrac> after 90 days it will raise an error and refuse to send any message
16:42:48 <dallemon[m]> <valldrac "after 90 days it will raise an e"> It will usually prompt for an update well before that though.
16:51:18 <valldrac> right, so you should keep updating or the app will stop working
16:58:51 <BrokenCog> well, gclient sync for Vanadium is up to 34G!!
17:17:38 <brenneke[m]> <valldrac "after 90 days it will raise an e"> Interesting thanks. Do you think anything different with respect to push notifications?
17:20:19 <valldrac> brenneke[m]: no difference
17:26:25 <brenneke[m]> <valldrac "brenneke: no difference"> OK, so really not reason not to just update with Aurora along with other apps.
17:52:13 <fujita_[m]> @natuso how did you manage to change the profile picture of the the 2nd profile and does your 2nd profile always stay in dark theme since mine would switch back to light theme every time I change profile
18:43:05 <brenneke[m]> > > <@yekip:privacytools.io> thanks. so you dont have to actually log out of current user or reboot or anytghing like that?
18:43:05 <brenneke[m]> > The user is locked out a few minutes after u switch.
18:43:05 <brenneke[m]> Is this user lockout time adjustable?
21:38:27 <kieni111[m]> Concerning signal: it uses around 1.7 gb ram after 6-8h - has anyone found out if the different versions (aurora, hp) behave less or more "hungry" or if it is some setting? (Pixel 3a, latest graphene)
21:42:10 <dazinism> fujita_: can change the image for a user profile in the emergency information
21:46:02 <minoas[m]> kieni111:  yes. it's called wire
21:47:22 <minoas[m]> signal is a battery hog as well.
21:50:28 <TheJollyRoger> kieni111[m]: use the official version from the Signal site.
21:50:41 <dazinism> conversations.im has low battery draw. Lots of servers to choose from.
21:50:52 <TheJollyRoger> That one is optimized for missing Play Services and I've left it running on my phone for days on end without a charge.
21:51:04 <TheJollyRoger> And running multiple instances of Signal in different profiles to boot.
21:51:21 <dazinism> TheJollyRoger: I've found sometimes it draws heavy
21:51:58 <dazinism> Wonder if it has something to do with quality of network connection?
21:52:32 <dazinism> Or maybe the load on signals servers?
21:52:36 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not sure.
21:52:53 <TheJollyRoger> I've just never had a problem with it, the last time I experienced heavy battery draw from Signal was years ago.
21:54:04 <dazinism> I have it offline mainly, recently left it on by accident and found it wasnt draining battery. Left it on for a few days and it did...
21:55:09 <TheJollyRoger> kieni111[m]: I recommend you simply just download it from the official website release.
21:59:31 * dazinism uploaded an image: IMG_20200508_225643.jpg (892KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LGyWYhhAmNSVfcdukLBQoSzm >
22:00:23 <dazinism> Thats my partners phone
22:00:58 <dazinism> Although I just checked and its installed from Aurora Store....gonna change it to another version
22:16:19 <dazinism> They havent got Play on their phone
22:35:32 <cx2[m]> Pretty sure I downloaded straight from Signal and it's running perfect... RiotX is taking a toll though... but still nothing substantial
22:51:24 <k-sloth[m]> I'm trying out mini victor, so far so good and also has less permissions. Yeah riotx uses a lot of battery it seems
23:04:22 <strcat[m]> instructions at https://grapheneos.org/install now fully cover Windows
23:04:37 <dazinism> valldrac do you know if theres likely to be a difference between battery draw from Play and apk download versions?
23:04:42 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: thanks!
23:04:43 <strcat[m]> also fleshed out build dependencies section at https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies instead of just pointing at AOSP docs
23:04:51 <strcat[m]> which are out-of-date and should not be used, really
23:16:38 <strcat[m]> going to eliminate some of the kernel build dependencies
23:20:04 <dazinism> kieni111: wrote up details of how to verify the signature fingerprint at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Verifying_apk_files
23:20:23 <TheJollyRoger> Thank you strcat[m] and dazinism!!!
23:20:24 <dazinism> For signal downloaded from their site
23:21:04 <dazinism> And you mate
23:21:41 <strcat[m]> ok removed the dependency on having make and some other tools
23:21:47 <strcat[m]> since they're prebuilts already
23:21:58 <strcat[m]> the kernel builds don't use the regular build sandbox setup since it's separate
23:22:02 <strcat[m]> kinda annoying to set up that stuff myself
23:23:56 <strcat[m]> AOSP build process uses a namespace-based sandbox to build now
23:24:02 <strcat[m]> and they whitelist what leaks in from the host
23:24:11 <strcat[m]> as part of making builds more robust / and reliably reproducible
23:24:36 <strcat[m]> that's why builds are reproducible by default
23:24:45 <strcat[m]> along with the other work that has gone into it
23:25:33 <aeonsolution[m]> does that make building everything less time consuming?
23:25:36 <strcat[m]> and if we ever want to extend anything like the compiler toolchain that's straightforward since all the dependencies are bundled and have reproducible builds themselves
23:25:53 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: not really since all these things used to just need to come from the OS
23:26:22 <strcat[m]> the prebuilts aren't to make building faster but to have reproducible builds and handle certain things like the Linux kernel and Vanadium separately due to their complexity
23:26:49 <strcat[m]> I don't currently provide GrapheneOS kernel prebuilts but I should so that building the kernel is an optional step
23:29:07 <aeonsolution[m]> i appreciate the clarification
23:29:48 <strcat[m]> basically all the build dependencies are becoming prebuilts - rather than just many
23:30:00 <strcat[m]> and there's an nsjail command included which runs everything in a namespace-based sandbox
23:30:02 <strcat[m]> and isolates it from the host
23:30:09 <JTL> Very interesting
23:30:12 <strcat[m]> and then only leaks certain things in that are whitelisted
23:30:24 <strcat[m]> eventually it will be fully isolated from the host other than the kernel, I'd expect
23:30:31 <cdesai> I was looking at that recently and was wondering if there's anything stopping them from mounting src ro
23:30:34 <cdesai> right now it's rw
23:30:35 <strcat[m]> and you can build all of the prebuilts using the AOSP source tree
23:30:47 <cdesai> strcat[m]: building prebuilts is a pita though
23:30:56 <strcat[m]> cdesai: depends, some is easy
23:31:05 <strcat[m]> it's easy enough to build clang, etc.
23:31:07 <strcat[m]> there's a manifest
23:31:34 <strcat[m]> and I asked them to start pushing tags for platform-tools which they do now
23:31:43 <cdesai> I saw r30 last week iirc
23:31:46 <strcat[m]> so you can check out a platform-tools tag and build the official releases of adb, fastboot, etc.
23:31:56 <strcat[m]> so if we wanted we could release our own platform-tools releases
23:32:01 <strcat[m]> instead of telling people to use theirs
23:32:06 <strcat[m]> although those builds are reproducible
23:32:10 <strcat[m]> and I just included a hash for now
23:32:17 <cdesai> there's https://android-rebuilds.beuc.net/
23:32:23 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
23:33:00 <strcat[m]> cdesai: that's the SDK though
23:33:37 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yeah but it does have platform tools too, and could have separate adb/fastboot zips via this setup as well.
23:34:15 <JTL> cdesai: very interesting
23:34:20 <strcat[m]> Arch Linux uses the platform-tools tags I got them to start making to build an 'android-tools' package which is an arbitrary subset of platform-tools with a couple extras
23:34:33 <strcat[m]> they use their own build system instead of the AOSP build system
23:34:35 <strcat[m]> because the maintainer doesn
23:34:45 <strcat[m]>  * because the maintainer doesn't want to check out the whole thing
23:34:49 <cdesai> I want to do something similar in Debian too.
23:34:54 <strcat[m]> that's why it's a subset and has some extra tools
23:35:02 <cdesai> if you spend some time, you can get away with checking out only some repos
23:35:21 <strcat[m]> yes but they don't even use the standard build system
23:35:41 <strcat[m]> the same thing applies to debian, etc. and that's why they mangle the version and have a totally broken build not based on an actual release tag for fastboot
23:35:51 <strcat[m]> because they just cobbled together their own thing and didn't understand what they were doing
23:36:01 <strcat[m]> made up their own version numbering system and override the standard one with it
23:36:05 <cdesai> strcat[m]: well, I'm on that team, and at that time, there were no platform tags
23:36:09 <strcat[m]> luckily their versions are lower than the proper ones
23:36:16 <cdesai> it's not made up, it's the standard android tags, as that's all was available
23:36:20 <strcat[m]> cdesai: there were manifests revisions but not tags
23:36:35 <strcat[m]> cdesai: run fastboot --version with the AOSP fastboot you build when you build AOSP
23:36:41 <strcat[m]> it still uses the standard versioning
23:36:43 <strcat[m]> it just calls it a release candidate
23:36:47 <strcat[m]> since it's not a real release
23:36:53 <strcat[m]> cdesai: they're clobbering that
23:38:25 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/VkmKKHBOhEZsuJMHbReCkeFr >
23:38:48 <cdesai> yeah I see what you mean, can fix.
23:38:50 <strcat[m]> it uses $VERSION-$BUILD_NUMBER
23:39:10 <strcat[m]> where $BUILD_NUMBER is your own custom versioning system
23:39:56 <strcat[m]> nice the build system depends on freetype2
23:39:58 <strcat[m]> for openjdk
23:40:24 <strcat[m]> testing it in a container atm
23:40:46 <strcat[m]> nesting namespaces doesn't work well and it breaks the build sandboxing
23:40:56 <strcat[m]> guess I should just make a custom chroot perhaps
23:41:15 <strcat[m]> namespaces are so fucking broken
23:41:16 <strcat[m]> such a joke
23:42:12 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/HovxjalipqRKejzgrfhmUIUQ >
23:42:15 <strcat[m]> nice work openjdk
23:42:26 <strcat[m]> trying to do something headless
23:42:32 <strcat[m]> and it pulls this BS
23:42:40 <strcat[m]> wonder if it can just be disabled
23:43:25 <strcat[m]> why the hell does openjdk load fonts
23:43:39 <cdesai> there are -headless packages, turns out that's what I have installed.
23:44:03 <cdesai> jre* -headless
23:44:18 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yes freetype2 is apparently a dependency of those
23:44:47 <strcat[m]> cdesai: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/jre11-openjdk-headless/
23:44:54 <strcat[m]> this is with the one bundled as a prebuilt in the sources though
23:45:38 <cdesai> ah right I keep forgetting that
23:46:27 <strcat[m]> I'm trying to make a somewhat reasonable list of deps
23:46:32 <strcat[m]> at least what you need on Arch
23:46:43 <cdesai> I have a list for debian somewhere
23:46:47 <strcat[m]> most things are prebuilts, but not everything
23:46:54 <strcat[m]> and some prebuilts have external library deps
23:47:06 <strcat[m]> in some cases the libraries are included for some prebuilts but not others
23:47:09 <strcat[m]> it has ncurses5 for GCC
23:47:15 <strcat[m]> but the clang prebuilt is also using it
23:47:32 <cdesai> apt install bc git htop ccache curl build-essential zip m4 python-protobuf python3-protobuf default-jdk-headless default-jre-headless libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libssl-dev
23:48:16 <cdesai> actual list would be smaller than this
23:49:22 <strcat[m]> don't need htop, ccache, curl at a minimum
23:49:34 <strcat[m]> build-essential includes stuff you don't need, it's a group of things
23:49:40 <strcat[m]> ofc if you just want to install everything it's fine
23:49:49 <strcat[m]> but I want a minimal list of deps basically
23:50:11 <cdesai> yeah this was more of a generic "this is what I used when setting up a machine for aosp build + chromium + kernel etc and it works"
23:50:32 <strcat[m]> cdesai: you need a font
23:50:33 <strcat[m]> lol
23:50:35 <strcat[m]> for openjdk
23:50:46 <cdesai> lol
23:50:47 * TheJollyRoger suddenly imagines someone running "apt install *" and the root partition expanding to take up >200GB of solid binaries...
23:50:49 <strcat[m]> it bails out if you have no TTF/OTF font installed
23:50:57 <strcat[m]> installing ttf-dejavu fixed that error
23:51:19 <strcat[m]> so yeah someone using a workstation would never run into that
23:51:22 <strcat[m]> but I'll document it
23:56:25 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: have you seen slackware?
23:56:34 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: slackware doesn't have dependency management in the package manager
23:56:38 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: do you know how they work around that?
23:56:45 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: a standard installation of slackware installs EVERYTHING
23:57:24 <TheJollyRoger> I...
23:57:30 <TheJollyRoger> I... I had no idea.
23:57:39 * TheJollyRoger suddenly goes wide-eyed.
23:57:47 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://docs.slackware.com/slackware:package_and_dependency_management_shouldn_t_put_you_off_slackware read this attempt to make it sound okay
23:58:14 <strcat[m]> it does make sense to have a well-defined core base system that's always installed but that's nothing like this
23:58:18 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't update it as a whole
23:58:23 <cdesai> imagine android make not having dependency resolution thus building everything everytime
23:58:53 <TheJollyRoger> ...good gravy.
23:59:05 <JTL> strcat[m]: Slackware, that's a name I haven't heard in awhile
23:59:20 <strcat[m]> cdesai: well it doesn't really use make anymore, uses kati implementation of make, and they are moving to blueprint quickly
23:59:31 <strcat[m]> we just use make to build the kernel
23:59:32 <TheJollyRoger> "Users who install slackware are recommended to install a full install (every package)"
23:59:32 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I know, but you know what I meant :P
23:59:36 <strcat[m]> yeah
23:59:45 <nickcalyx[m]> Slackware is the first Linux distro I installed, from 3.5" disks
23:59:56 <strcat[m]> it isn't really possible to just update slackware to a new release either
