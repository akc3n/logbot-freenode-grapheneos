00:00:50 <kevr> question: flashing a pixel 4a, are there any special cases where a release for pixel 4a would brick the device, or is it relatively safe for all revisions etc?
00:03:24 <anima[m]> I flashed my sunfish yesterday , 0 issues
00:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> Hello kevr, the only reason that you would end up softbricking is if you use an old version of fastboot and attempt to bypass the fastboot version check.
00:10:17 <TheJollyRoger> Rumour has it that if you attempt to write a 4a image to a 4a5G phone, it will hardbrick. So don't do either of those things.
00:11:29 <anima[m]> it have to be intentional, given you have codename in fast boot menu...
00:15:27 <kevr> TheJollyRoger • is there an reference to the rumor or why it became a rumor?
00:15:42 <kevr> TheJollyRoger • thank you, by the way, for the quick reply and help!
00:17:13 <anima[m]> as long as you follow the guide , you will never have issues
00:17:57 <kevr> that's a bold claim :o
00:18:40 <JTL> kevr: Someone in another channel claims to have done it :|
00:19:18 <louipc> i kinda wanna try
00:21:23 <TheJollyRoger> kevr: I call it a rumour, because someone in another channel mentioned to have hardbricked their 4a5G by attempting to put a 4a image on it. Supposedly, there is a check in place to prevent that from happening, but so far we haven't been able to confirm this.
00:21:29 <TheJollyRoger> So that's why I say "rumour has it."
00:22:52 <TheJollyRoger> kevr: outside of that, what we've also had happen is that people have been following a guide on the internet that advocates using a third-party fastboot, and another person has been advocating to remove the versioning check.
00:23:50 <TheJollyRoger> What typically happens if you do both of those -- tampering with the versioning safety check and using nonstandard fastboot from shady sources -- is that older or incorrectly versioned releases of fastboot may not support autodetection, and may install the operating system to the incorrect A/B partition.
00:24:16 <TheJollyRoger> This isn't the end of the world, but it does mean you'll get the "No Operating System found" error, and your phone will not boot.
00:24:50 <TheJollyRoger> If you do that, then you simply will need to start all over again and get the correct version of fastboot and NOT REMOVE THE SAFETY CHECK from the installation script.
00:25:12 <TheJollyRoger> Aside from that, Pixels are built like tanks, they're difficult to brick.
00:25:15 <kevr> i gotcha.
00:25:28 <kevr> nice :)
00:25:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yep!
00:25:34 <kevr> thanks a lot!
00:25:46 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime! Anything else I could answer for you?
00:27:00 <kevr> I should be okay, I'll just follow the guide; if I get stuck I'll ask around in here. Looks pretty straightforward and complete though
00:27:32 <TheJollyRoger> Sure! Yes, the guide is your best bet.
00:27:40 <TheJollyRoger> Correction: the *official* guide!
00:27:52 <kevr> i'm quite glad you guys actually have this channel, searching around google for custom roms on android generally freaks me out and super risky
00:27:56 <kevr> (and the guide)
00:28:01 <kevr> *official guide :P
00:28:05 <TheJollyRoger> If you are installing from a Linux host, you will need udev rules to permit your device to pass through.
00:28:32 <kevr> will keep that in mind
00:28:35 <TheJollyRoger> Yep! Well, the good news is, GrapheneOS is not really a "custom ROM" - it's a full production-quality release, with signed releases and over the air updates.
00:28:48 <kevr> neato
00:29:16 <TheJollyRoger> Releases are not done as userdebug builds, the way LineageOS does them, they're realesed as full factory images, the way Google would release them.
00:29:38 <TheJollyRoger> Be sure to lock your bootloader after installation, because that's what completes the installation; each instance of GrapheneOS on a given class of device is signed, verified, and bitwise identical.
00:31:37 <kevr> For sure.
00:31:55 <kevr> I've got "fastboot version 30.0.5" from repos on Arch Linux.
00:32:01 * kevr hopes this one satisfies ;)
00:32:05 <TheJollyRoger> Perfect. That's the right way to go!
00:32:08 <kevr> nice.
00:32:10 <kevr> <3
00:33:17 <kevr> I'll report how it went in a few days, I don't have the phone on-hand currently. again, thanks a ton for all of your help, and let me know if you need a c/cpp/python code monkey for anything, i don't currently have a job and i'd love to contribute where it helps
00:33:53 <TheJollyRoger> We totally do!
00:34:15 <kevr> (...i can do others to, php, javascript, whatever's clever; haven't touched rust yet though, and i'm not too big on erlang)
00:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> I'm unfortunately not the best person to ask for where to fit in with development (I'm just the greeter, not actually a developer yet!), but the developers indeed do hang out here and we need volunteers, desperately.
00:35:03 <kevr> in that case, i'll be regularly peeping in here to see what i can jump in on (:
00:35:22 <TheJollyRoger> I think python is definitely used in some of the support stuff for GrapheneOS, and C also plays a big role in it, especially since there's a lot of work involved with patching the kernels and such.
00:35:30 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo! Well glad to have you aboard the ship!
00:35:45 <kevr> \o/

16:36:26 <strcat[m]> ephemeralang: use the recommended DNS-over-TLS provided by the OS
16:37:01 <strcat[m]> ephemeralang: if you really want to use something else, that's what the VPN service feature provides, apps can provide arbitrary features based on the network traffic being tunneled through them
16:37:21 <strcat[m]> you need to get support from app authors for that
16:37:46 <strcat[m]> if you're using a VPN you should probably be using their DNS instead of connecting to external DNS servers through it, see our FAQ
16:39:00 <strcat[m]> VPN service apps can provide their own DNS servers for use by the OS without tunneling other traffic through themselves, or they can do both
16:39:21 <strcat[m]> it's just the standard way for apps to do those things, and they can provide a combination of different features if they want
16:42:08 <jpds> lodtank: Easiest is syncthing.net

17:28:24 <dwkr[m]> anupritaisno1: odd that AnySoft Keyboard has so many languages but not Korean.
17:28:24 <dwkr[m]> Some users will use the Arora store to download a keyboard like the gboard and then shut off it's network access in Graphene's permissions settings. So that's a potential route for you.

19:24:15 <arjan25> Greetings! I'm trying to install GrapheneOS onto a Pixel 4a (sunfish), but fastboot doesn't recognize the device. I've seen mention of 1) drivers; 2) USB cable as causes. I'm using latest Windows 10, and the device is recognized in Windows when started, so that seems unlikely to be the problem.
19:25:02 <arjan25> And I've now tried the official USB-C cable on the two USB-C ports on my PC, and a USB-A to C cable as well, with no success.
19:25:34 <arjan25> Fastboot is at `fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874`
19:25:57 <arjan25> Any pointers how to proceed?
19:28:18 <madd_hatter[m]> 3xl Is the visual voicemail suppose to be integrated into AOSP and by extension GOS phone app?
19:28:18 <madd_hatter[m]> Not speaking about its real world functionality but its settings / button should be visible in the phone app, correct?
19:35:14 <pamachs[m]> <arjan25 "Greetings! I'm trying to install"> Honestly I stopped trying this kind of stuff on windows a long time ago. Using Linux I had O problems. Might be worth looking into.
19:36:49 <arjan25> Any reports that using Linux with the same hardware solved such a fastboot issue? Cause Win10 is officially supported.
19:38:09 <anima[m]> <arjan25 "Greetings! I'm trying to install"> check devices manager, install driver via windows update
19:38:25 <arjan25> It says driver is up to date
19:44:35 <madd_hatter[m]> arjan25:  I had no issues once I had current Android SDK tools.  The only thing not part of the standard procedure I did just out of habit after oem unlocking was I enabled usb debugging.
19:44:35 <madd_hatter[m]> The only other issue I have seen frequently deals with the usb cables/adapters.  Seems people try a few then go buy another and it works.
19:45:41 <madd_hatter[m]> I know usb debug is not needed in fastboot but that's the only thing out of normal procedure I did
19:47:08 <arjan25> Anyone know if it has to be USB-C to USB-C? (in which case I can skip trying other cables)
19:48:23 <madd_hatter[m]> No I used A to c cablr
19:48:34 <madd_hatter[m]> * No I used A to c cable
19:53:00 <dar_gomml[m]> <madd_hatter[m] "No I used A to c cablr"> same
20:05:18 <arjan25> So it turns out it was a driver issue after all. At first Windows reported driver OK, no updates available. After a reboot somehow the device was no longer recognized and showed up as generic USB device. After installing the Google USB driver the phone is recognized as "Android Device", and now `fastboot devices` does list the phone.
20:06:09 <arjan25> So it seems that relying on the standard Windows USB driver is not sufficient (at least not in all cases).
20:23:54 <fredrickdouglas> I am trying to flash crosshatch-factory-2020.11.27.15.zip on my Pixel 3xl. I have done it before but now it is saying that my fastboot is too old. I have the latest version.
20:25:19 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: What operating system are you running on your computer?
20:25:32 <fredrickdouglas> Windows 10. Same as last time.
20:25:53 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: You're using the PowerShell?
20:26:22 <fredrickdouglas> I tried cmd and powershell
20:26:54 <madd_hatter[m]> 👍
20:26:54 <madd_hatter[m]> MS Windows strikes again.  I have almost completely cut, hacked, and torn Windows and its eco system from life.  Only have it for one or two apps I can not replace YET.
20:27:52 <fredrickdouglas> Yeah, I kinda hate linux and macs are expensive so the cheap windows is all that remains
20:28:21 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: Have you been following the guide from the very beginning again? Including curling the latest fastboot and including it into the PATH variable?
20:29:19 <fredrickdouglas> I never got it to work by strictly following the directions. I have had better luck following techlore's tutorial on youtube.
20:29:35 <Thatcher[m]> <fredrickdouglas "Yeah, I kinda hate linux and mac"> I installed Graphene from Ubuntu Mate and it is a straightforward process with no bullshit. If you hate linux, try out Mate
20:29:36 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: Don't do it.
20:29:53 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: We can't help you if you follow unofficial guides.
20:30:13 <fredrickdouglas> I tried the official guides as well
20:30:25 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: A video is outdated fast. The guide is a living document.
20:30:48 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: The guide is just copy & paste.
20:31:06 <fredrickdouglas> Yeah, I noticed that they updated it but still having issues
20:31:12 <nscnt> fredrickdouglas: My suggestion is to try it from the beginning; just following the official guide.

22:46:27 <henko> Hello. So my old phone is slowly dying. I am thinking about getting a Pixel 4a and install GrapheneOS onto it. The question is how do I install some proprietary apps like for public transport in my country on it, which are only available on the official google play store?
22:46:30 <henko> I
22:47:46 <henko> I've discovered the 'Aurora Store' but is this recommended from a privacy perspective?
22:48:02 <henko> Thank you for your input.
22:48:28 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <henko "Hello. So my old phone is slowly"> If they don't require Google Play Services, you could probably install them from Aurora Store.
22:49:00 <henko> and if they do? is that a dead giveaway that the app won't work?
22:49:26 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <henko "I've discovered the 'Aurora Stor"> From a privacy perspective, Google can't relate the app to your account. But if the app itself is not privacy friendly, then no.
22:50:03 <antonizoon[m]> henko: some apps wont work at all without google play services, but other apps just warn about it but work fine.
22:50:16 <antonizoon[m]> Or wont give notifications, etc..
22:50:18 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <vsinghsanwal[m] "From a privacy perspective, Goog"> But you could still create another user profile on the phone and use that for non private apps like that (I guess)
22:50:50 <henko> how do you use grapheneOS?
22:50:57 <antonizoon[m]> Wasnt there the Shelter app on F-Droid to create sandboxed work profiles too
22:50:57 <henko> Do most of you guys just have two phones?
22:51:02 <jpds> henko: Same way you use android
22:51:44 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <antonizoon[m] "Wasnt there the Shelter app on F"> Yes, but not great from a security perspective is my understanding. (If shelter is compromised, everything in it is)
22:52:51 <antonizoon[m]> Whereas user profiles are sandboxed far better?
22:52:54 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <henko "Do most of you guys just have tw"> No. Most of us prioritise what is important to us and make hard choices (for e.g. not using that convenient transport app or using its website etc.)
22:53:20 <jpds> antonizoon[m]: Yep
22:53:58 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <antonizoon[m] "Whereas user profiles are sandbo"> It is a completely different user, so like a proper android user. Whereas shelter just creates a work profile that an admin (in this case shelter, I think) has full control over.
22:55:29 <antonizoon[m]> Good to know
22:55:38 <vsinghsanwal[m]> Everything I am stating is either from personal experience or picked up here and there. So take it with a grain of salt.
22:55:39 <lev[m]> <henko "Do most of you guys just have tw"> no, I've found there to be minimal trade off tbh.  the biggest hit is notifications not working for some things, but it works for the important stuff: email, sms/signal, phone, calendar, alarm, etc
22:56:32 <antonizoon[m]> Notifications do work fine on element which by definition is a notification service
22:56:53 <antonizoon[m]> I guess a bot could just be made for some instances to ping your phone
22:57:13 <antonizoon[m]> Well, not a drop in replacement obviously.
22:57:28 <henko> the thing is I already have a pinephone which can do the most basic stuff. for me its basically a linux with call & sms functionality... but the performance is still just way too lackluster
22:58:06 <henko> antonizoon[m]: yeah true... I try to use an as atomic app selection as I can, but some apps well are needed
22:58:17 <vsinghsanwal[m]> Graphene is way more usable than that. Way more.
22:59:26 <henko> like my online bank *needs* an smartphone to confirm transfers and the public transport app which doesn't have a nearly as complete offer on their webpage
23:00:23 <henko> vsinghsanwal[m]: glad to hear
23:01:04 <jpds> henko: My bank app complains about not having play services and then carries on fine
23:02:20 <henko> jpds: and for apps which absolutely need play services I could use (https://microg.org/), right?
23:02:29 <jpds> henko: No
23:02:43 <jpds> henko: https://grapheneos.org/#never-google-services
23:05:18 <botder[m]> I only wanted to get rid of WhatsApp but chose to buy a new Pixel 4a and install GrapheneOS on it
23:07:23 <botder[m]> The phone is really nice and the OS runs well
23:13:35 <Thatcher[m]> <botder[m] "I only wanted to get rid of What"> Good decision
23:16:23 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <henko "jpds: and for apps which absolut"> Eventually. It will take time, but my understanding is that the GrapheneOS team are starting work on a special implementation and build of microg that will be secure. But don't depend on that now.
23:17:41 <vsinghsanwal[m]> But yes, some of apps which require Google play services, also just give me a warning bit work perfectly. While others just don't start.
23:23:29 <henko> okay. thanks @all for your input. I will just buy the pixel 4a and check if its usable as a daily driver. I hope it will :)
23:25:47 <henko> One last question... what about Map navigation. I can really get rid of all Google apps except for Google Maps. But I'll gess that this app heavily relies on Play Services. I will try to use OSM
23:26:07 <henko> But does anybody have real life experience with Gmaps?
23:27:34 <henko> I think I'm not making any friends here when I'm mentioning Google products so often *heh*
23:30:49 <Lia[m]> <henko "One last question... what about "> try using it in Vanadium incognito tab instead?
23:31:53 <jpds> henko: I use osmand+, gmaps apparently works without play services
23:32:28 <Lia[m]> <jpds "henko: I use osmand+, gmaps appa"> Same here
23:35:51 <antonizoon[m]> henko: in many cases open street maps in osmand is far more detailed than google maps. Works offline too.
23:36:23 <antonizoon[m]> Btw what im really wondering is how you managed to live with the pinephone so long. Is it really at least somewhat usable yet
23:38:57 <henko> even if you get by... your battery is dead in 5 hours in idle and 2-3 hours of usage. surfing, reading email
23:39:18 <henko> well i used it as a mobile laptop without social functionality
23:40:08 <antonizoon[m]> henko How good does it work in convergence mode
23:40:50 <antonizoon[m]> As the web browser is the most intensive component... Hows firefox or chrome
23:41:05 <henko> never tried it. don't have the dock
23:42:32 <antonizoon[m]> And what distros seemed decent? Ubports seemed to be the top one usability wise, but the simple x server was what worked the best, whereas phosh and kde seemed to be subpar
23:42:53 <antonizoon[m]> henko: how do you use it as a mobile laptop
23:44:17 <antonizoon[m]> Especially with the latest mainline kernel... On par with the orange pi or heck even a raspberry pi yet support wise?
23:44:32 <henko> The UBports edition worked the best out of the box imho... but still laggy and sometimes not responsive and slugish
23:44:38 <strcat[m]> please keep the channel on-topic
23:45:26 <henko> i mean i would say you can use it as a daily driver if you limit your use cases... but you need a hefty battery pack with you all day
23:45:54 <henko> I connect via mosh to my server and attach to the tmux session
23:46:37 <henko> from there i use all my ncurses programs like neomutt
23:47:04 <henko> the browser one the pinephone works decent. you can even play youtube mostly stutter free
23:47:14 <strcat[m]> keep the channel on-topic
23:47:35 <henko> strcat[m]: sorry. wilco.
23:47:49 <strcat[m]> there's a #grapheneos-offtopic channel
23:52:48 <`Scott`[m]> Hey all, should I expect push notifications to work (via GCM/FCM) if I apply some work (e.g. install Micro-G, etc.) -- or will it never work?
23:53:23 <`Scott`[m]> I'm finding it hard to find any concrete information as to whether it can work or not.
23:53:40 <strcat[m]> there is no inherent dependency of push notifications on FCM
23:54:01 <strcat[m]> apps can provide a different implementation, and that works fine
23:54:21 <strcat[m]> there is nothing you can do to make FCM work on GrapheneOS
23:54:31 <strcat[m]> it's not included
23:55:32 <strcat[m]>  * there is nothing you can do to make apps using FCM via Play services to work on GrapheneOS
23:56:16 <`Scott`[m]> Okay, thanks. I'm fine for personal stuff with no push but there's one app for work that uses traditional Android push notifications (Pager Duty) that I need to have working.
23:56:51 <`Scott`[m]> Looks like I'll need to drop back to text messages. Bums.
23:56:59 <`Scott`[m]> Thanks.
23:57:57 <`Scott`[m]> Also, coming from stock Android 11, "flip to shhh" was handy but I don't see it in GOS.  It's that correct?
23:59:16 <strcat[m]> traditional Android push notifications is the app keeping open a connection to receive pushed data from the server
23:59:38 <strcat[m]> FCM is part of Play services, not the baseline Android
