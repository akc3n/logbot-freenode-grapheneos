01:04:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy a7-j7b5g5[m], sorry about that. I haven't tried it on Ubuntu 20.04. I've been able to get Userdebug builds to work from Arch but that was a few months ago.
01:06:05 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> What operating system should I use Ubuntu 14.04 like aosp recommends?
01:06:16 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> * What operating system should I use? Ubuntu 14.04 like aosp recommends?
01:06:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hi a7-j7b5g5[m], currently we've had the best success on Arch. I have a small writeup that might help you.
01:06:31 <TheJollyRoger> Give me a sec.
01:07:24 <TheJollyRoger> https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge/blob/master/For%20Maintainers/Setting-Up-Your-Host.md This guide is a few months out of date, so let me know if protobuf gives you a problem, I had that issue here.
02:26:02 <ianab02[m]> I think I might have messed up my phone worse than it should be.
02:26:48 <ianab02[m]> When I tried to remove graphene os I somehow got my phone into the developer android .
02:28:21 <TheJollyRoger> Hello ianab02[m], are you trying to revert to the factory operating system?
02:29:24 <ianab02[m]> Yes I am sadly
02:29:48 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. Have you considered trying the Android flash tool from Google?
02:30:30 <ianab02[m]> Tried that and that is what gave me the developer android.
02:30:57 <louipc> oh did you manually select the image
02:31:19 <ianab02[m]> louipc: what do you mean?
02:32:03 <louipc> which page did you visit

02:33:39 <ianab02[m]> it looks like it will install the correct version one sec

05:27:19 <Lia[m]> Yeah, just advise to everyone to don't buy from Verizon
05:28:55 <lonew0lf[m]> <Lia[m] "For what apps?"> For example I am looking for desk clock app
05:29:57 <Lia[m]> Oh, you have to unfortunately build that app yourself.
05:30:36 <Lia[m]> Using Android studio
05:30:53 <Lia[m]> To at least make sure of the apps' integrity
05:32:01 <Lia[m]> There is an easier way, but you have to trust the apk giver, which is just some random user here. Better off finding in fdroid/izzydroid repo
05:32:40 <lonew0lf[m]> <Lia[m] "Oh, you have to unfortunately bu"> ok sure thanks
06:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> hi treesa24[m], aw crud, that sucks to hear! Unfortunately, there's nothing I know how to do to unlock the bootloader on a Verizon Bootloader locked Pixel 4a. There is a persistent Carrier ID set in that phone and your best bet would simply be to return it.
06:35:53 <TheJollyRoger> *CARRIER_ID which prevents bootloader unlocking set in that phone
06:39:35 <ayaen_t[m]> At the risk of sounding stupid just want to ask wether a phone bought from a retailer suggested by google on their official 'product page' has an unlockable bootloader.
06:39:35 <ayaen_t[m]>  in my case , i.e. india,  it would be flipkart
06:40:18 <ayaen_t[m]> Cause the only reason i buy pixel is to flash graphene os on it
06:41:08 <TheJollyRoger> ayaen_t[m]: I unfortunately wouldn't be able to tell you. You'd have to ask them and make sure they have a really solid return policy in case they don't know the difference between "carrier unlocked" and "bootloader unlockable."
06:42:21 <TheJollyRoger> ayaen_t[m]: when new phones are generally brought out, what happens is that retailers generally will bail their existing Verizon locked phones at lower prices to try to get rid of them and get them out of their inventory while they still can.
06:43:00 <TheJollyRoger> This often floods the market.
06:44:14 <ayaen_t[m]> That last ones a scary thought
06:44:32 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah.
07:05:07 <CarpeDiem[m]> Are there many users interested in using the pixel 5 with GoS? I have a close friend who is a android dev who  may be willing to build & maintain the OS for pixel 5s

07:08:53 <SB13X> Hi Guys just wondering what the advice is and what functionality I can expect for utilising PWA (Progressive Web Apps) on GrapheneOS? If these are viable does anyone know of or can recommend a good place to find them cataloged?
07:13:44 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2020.11.27.15 release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.11.27.15
07:14:05 <strcat[m]> SB13X: they work well for the most part, although web apps that use FCM instead of the other form of push won't have push
07:14:24 <strcat[m]> SB13X: and we don't host our own signing server yet so it means using Google's signing server which is not really a big deal
07:16:19 <SB13X> strcat[m] thanks for the help :D

07:36:31 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: don't know what you mean
07:36:44 <strcat[m]> cenapatop689: we don't offer anything like that, you're using some sketchy third party device management app
07:36:51 <strcat[m]> if you want something from them, ask them for support
07:37:09 <strcat[m]> it's not in the scope of GrapheneOS
07:37:33 <strcat[m]> it's very risky for users to be messing with enabling/disabling app components
07:37:42 <strcat[m]> and it's not going to achieve what you probably think it will
07:37:47 <cenapatop689[m]> ðŸ˜• I know
07:37:53 <strcat[m]> if you want to break things you have adb shell
07:37:54 <strcat[m]> and pm

07:39:55 <strcat[m]>   unhide [--user USER_ID] PACKAGE_OR_COMPONENT
07:41:28 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend against trying to micro-manage which app components are enabled
07:41:43 <strcat[m]> apps can disable/enable their own sub-components as needed
07:43:11 <strcat[m]> if you want to limit their ability to run in the background there's a toggle for that

11:25:58 <Golli[m]> Why would you need an anti-virus in the first place?
11:25:59 <Golli[m]> The best defence is to not go around downloading and executing random stuff.
11:46:14 <strcat[m]> the main reason is that an AV app can't actually determine if something is malicious
11:46:18 <strcat[m]> it just can't be done
11:46:45 <strcat[m]> and what they even want to detect as that is a way smaller subset than what users would want
11:47:33 <strcat[m]> but it just doesn't work and what actually has to be done is providing a strong app sandbox, case-by-case user consent for authorizing access to data, permission system for when that isn't practical (but this is historically overused and is being largely replaced over time)
11:50:01 <ayaen_t[m]> True . also as a user instead of recklessly installing and downloading from unknown sources it goes a long way to just be mindful of ones sources
11:50:31 <strcat[m]> it will be better when we have our first party repository
11:50:39 <strcat[m]> and then you can use that to get apps for obtaining more apps
11:51:09 <ayaen_t[m]> look forward to it
12:02:05 <userman23[m]> Is there a way to require authentication before opening an app?
12:12:59 <strcat[m]> put it in a dedicated profile
12:13:15 <strcat[m]> and then the storage also gets encrypted with a key specific to that app (since profiles have their own encryption keys)
12:13:33 <strcat[m]>  * put it in a dedicated user profile

12:45:07 <renlord> oopsie
13:26:20 <SB13X> Yes I know this is a vanity request that in the big scheme of things doesn't offer any "real" value but I have to ask, other than compiling graphene from source with the relevant modifications made at that point, is there anyway of theming the QS/Settings menus? The teal of the QS isn't to my taste and would prefer an AMOLED black background to the
13:26:20 <SB13X> QS/Settings menu too.
14:41:37 <Lia[m]> Odd, why does the Vanadium does not have QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES permission now despite the patch at the latest beta (11.27.15)
14:44:15 <Lia[m]> Or nevermind, apparently, the latest Vanadium build is not bundled with 11.27.15 OS update

16:35:22 <dontaskme[m]> Hi, new user here. I just bought a Pixel 4a (not 5G) and am trying to install GOS. I have followed the instructions to the letter but am stuck at unlocking the bootloader. I get <waiting for any device> and nothing happens. Fastboot --version works ok. I have USB C to USB C connected.
16:35:22 <dontaskme[m]> I've had a search through previous posts and it looks like several people have had the same issue but I couldn't see any solutions that helped. Any help would be greatly appreciated
16:40:24 <nscnt> dontaskme[m]: What's your computer's operating system?
16:40:32 <dontaskme[m]> W10
16:41:16 <nscnt> dontaskme[m]: Are you able to test other USB ports and/or cables?
16:41:31 <alzxjm[m]> SB13X: you can kinda change icon themes and accent colors with adb commands.
16:41:44 <alzxjm[m]> The icons are mostly persistent, though they'll usually revert if you change profiles.
16:41:58 <alzxjm[m]> The accent color doesn't usually stick, in my experience.
16:42:46 <dontaskme[m]> <nscnt "dontaskme: Are you able to test "> Unfortunately I don't have any other cables than the one that was shipped with the phone
16:42:53 <alzxjm[m]> SB13X: https://forum.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-II/themes/theme-enable-pixel-themes-adb-t4118377
16:43:28 <alzxjm[m]> I kinda doubt this would be a recommended procedure on GrapheneOS, and it's certainly not supported. Use at your own risk.
16:43:53 <alzxjm[m]> I changed my icon themes and it doesn't seem to cause any problems.
16:46:17 <SB13X> Lia[m] thanks for that and alzxjm[m] I've checked the issue tracker and suggested the use of something similar to what is implemented as a 'theme engine' of sorts by Dirty Unicorns. I know their lead Alex Cruz has been a big proponent of FOSS.
16:47:12 <nscnt> dontaskme[m]: I don't really like to suggest it (as it shouldn't be needed), but it helped others with the same issue: Download and install the Google USB Driver. Then try again. Otherwise I don't have another idea how to help you and want you to be able to proceed.
16:49:16 <nscnt> Windows 10 should have the drivers already, but well.
16:49:30 <nscnt> dontaskme[m]: Of course, be sure you phone and Windows is up to date.

16:50:25 <nscnt> Windows 10 should have the *needed drivers already...
16:51:49 <SB13X> dontaskme[m] this issue will definitely be down to either USB cable (I've come to depend on Belkin cables myself) as my in the box cable wouldn't work OR as mentioned again the drivers not being up to date.
16:51:59 <dontaskme[m]> <nscnt "dontaskme: I don't really like t"> Thanks. I'll try that. I made sure W10 and the phone were updated before I started

16:55:57 <nscnt> dontaskme[m]: Good. Waiting for your feedback whether it helped.
17:02:13 <SB13X> dontaskme[m] yes they are, common and well known issue surrounding fastboot and adb being very picky over what cables they function with. A recognised and trusted brand with USB A-C is recommended.

23:50:55 <strcat[m]> CaptainBlackton: https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
23:51:55 <strcat[m]> if you want other devices to be supported you need to contribute to identifying suitable devices through research and testing, and then of course after finding one commit to working on developing and maintaining support for multiple years
23:52:06 <strcat[m]> it has to meet the requirements
23:56:58 <CaptainBlackton> OK, thanks <strcat[m]>, I'm reading that now.
23:58:54 <userman23[m]> Not sure if this would be a graphene thing, or a provider question, but I am using the native wifi hotspot tool found in settings. I turn it on, connect my client to it. I have internet connectivity on my phone. But my client does not receive any internet connectivity. I have a Pixel 3A device on the AT&T network. I am running Android 11 with GrapheneOS.
23:58:57 <CaptainBlackton> Hi <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo>. I don't know too much about phone hardware other than what I can read in reviews and product specs, etc. However, a phone's hardware being made by Google just makes me feel like I shouldn't trust it. But you're understanding is that if the Google software were removed, the hardware itself is very good in terms of privacy?
23:59:37 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure why you would say that relative to other phone hardware
23:59:42 <strcat[m]> doesn't really make much sense
23:59:54 <strcat[m]> and they're definitely the most secure devices that are available right now
