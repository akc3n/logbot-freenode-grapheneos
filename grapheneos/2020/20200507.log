01:02:47 <TheJollyRoger> leohopper[m]: the part for the udev rules is specific to Linux distributions, such as Debian (and all the distributions that use Debian as an upstream provider, such as Ubuntu, Mint, TAILS, Whonix, etc) that use udev for device management and permissions.
01:03:03 <yzernik> should i use a VPN or not?
01:03:37 <madaidan[m]> yzernik: we can't answer that for you
01:03:41 <TheJollyRoger> If you run Windows or a Macintosh, or a Linux distribution that does not use udev, that step not apply to you. I have a PR outstanding for udev but it hasn't been merged yet.
01:06:44 <TheJollyRoger> yzernik: my answer is that depends on whether you trust your VPN service provider (which could be operating out of a different jurisdiction, or even lie about their security or the measures they take to protect your privacy) more than you trust your ISP.
01:08:13 <TheJollyRoger> Since you're essentially moving the man in the middle.
01:08:20 <TheJollyRoger> That's all a VPN is doing for you.

03:02:08 <renlord> my dkim milter keeps rejecting bad signatures lol
03:02:36 <renlord> since my institution maintains a broken mailserver, i cant receive any mail from uni anymore

03:05:00 <renlord> the uni MTA is actually unauthenticated, everyone can use it

06:51:10 <TheJollyRoger> So far this project has been credited with: Porting PAX patches to the kernel, achieving production-quality releases granting privacy on Android, improving the memory handling routines of Linux and operating systems in general with the hardened_malloc, Improving the Bionic C Library, making remote attestation and online verification available to the masses and easy... and inventing the
06:51:11 <TheJollyRoger> E-Timpani.
06:51:47 <JTL> Ahahaha
06:51:51 <JTL> That last one
08:30:19 <chris42> renlord: regarding postfix, you should probably generate your own DH parameters, as recommended by postfix. If you want to get rid of EDH, you should use the exclude list: http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers
08:31:41 <chris42> renlord: the warning for "you might not get email" is for smtpd. That one should basically accept everything, even unencrypted, as you never know how dumb a sending E-Mail Server is
08:42:37 <chris42> renlord: Oh and for the exclude list it is then kEDH

11:56:04 <joshman[m]> And breaking into GOS device is highly unpopular due to lack of users. What's the point after all? There's millions of iOS and billions of Android users walking around

13:01:20 <magicos[m]> I'm thinking about switching to iPhone because a lot of the government apps I need to function like a normal person in society aren't working because of missing Play Services.
13:01:20 <magicos[m]> Are the iPhone still recommended over lets say an Pixel with a Google account where data collection is turned off? If so, why?

13:19:13 <chris42> magicos: not only an issue in Denmark. A lot of things are not working without certain google services.
13:19:37 <dallemon[m]> magicos: I live there as well and most stuff works, only the 2FA started not working recently. They said I should try clearing data and reinstalling.
13:19:57 <joshman[m]> You need to learn to live without those apps government is pushing on you
13:20:09 <chris42> Especially push notifications is the one that is keeping me away from graphene so far, asa much as I would want to use it
13:20:10 <dallemon[m]> And I use a travelcard after they made the transport app rely on a location provider instead of GPS
13:21:41 <amsurana> > Especially push notifications
13:21:42 <joshman[m]> Guys. It's your choice. Either they push notifications or you chose
13:22:05 <dallemon[m]> Not having reliable push has made me use my phone a lot less, quite nice actually.  😁
13:22:26 <joshman[m]> Yes
13:22:31 <amsurana> Push notifications is issue in every custom OS. MicroG can be viable option, but I am not sure how far it is good for production.
13:22:56 <chris42> I use microg on my AOSP... For push notifications it is working fine
13:23:23 <chris42> same with the additional location provider (I use local databases)
13:23:52 <chris42> but I am not sure if it would work on graphene... will probably try one day
13:24:14 <chris42> issue with microg is, that the project owner is quite busy so there is little progress.
13:24:43 <chris42> Would love to see certain funtions within graphene... properly implemented and maintained
13:24:59 <chris42> but that is a question of basic philosophy

13:48:04 <ransome[m]> <chris42 "but I am not sure if it would wo"> It won't as in Graphene (as also for instance in regular LineageOS) signature spoofing is disabled for a reason. And that is needed for MicroG. So you will be able to install it, but it won't work properly. Unless you tamper hardly with Graphene which makes the whole idea useless. I have it (MicroG) installed isolated with Netguard on Graphene though, to get the magic Gcam
13:48:04 <ransome[m]> working, but please don't tell this to the project owner ;)
13:48:10 <cx2[m]> chris42: Spoofing signatures? No one sees a problem with that, or the slippery slope that could lead down?
13:49:10 <ransome[m]> @cx2
13:49:14 <ransome[m]> solid timing mate ;)
13:54:33 <chris42> cx2: i know about the signature spoofing and the discussion around CM and then Lineage.
13:55:31 <chris42> That is why I say there should be a proper implementation in graphene OS, probably without a "public" signature spoofing permission
13:55:40 <chris42> should = I would like
13:56:30 <chris42> The issue i have is, that as much as I love security and privacy, I am use it out of principle, not because I am under threat or anything
14:00:42 <cx2[m]> <chris42 "The issue i have is, that as muc"> same scenario here.... but boy have those principles grown strong.
14:01:18 <cx2[m]> chris42: I dont' even know that Daniel, et al. would even approve something like that IF someone took the time to develop it. Can't speak for them though.
14:01:53 <chris42> cx2: Yes, but if I would be under thread, I would use a dumb phone and hide away. For a regular person that loves security and privacy that needs to be accessible
14:03:20 <chris42> I think we can agree that the gold standard would be to have a smartphone with all the comforts you see nowadays, just with security and privacy
14:03:32 <cx2[m]> <chris42 "cx2: Yes, but if I would be unde"> Well that's just not true at all... it certainly doesn't "need" to be accessible. Not at all. I can honestly say that I have absolutely zero need for microG or gapps in general. Not a single instance.
14:04:39 <cx2[m]> chris42: I would venture to say there are a lot of GrapheneOS users that would agree. If all of a sudden my work required that I have a specific app for something (hard to imagine) Then I would hope they are also providing the phone.
14:05:54 <cx2[m]> chris42: Otherwise, I don't know that there is an app that anyone "Needs". 13 years ago, no one even knew apps really existed
14:06:13 <cx2[m]> Largely because they didn't
14:10:12 <chris42> cx2: <13 years ago, no one even knew apps really existed> That is quite a shitty argument, then we would still live in caves. :-D Of course I can stop communicating with friends and family, banking, ticketing, etc. but then why do I need a smartphone?
14:14:24 <chris42> I think GOS is really a great project, as it looks on android with the security and privacy first focus. And you can see how Daniels work is carried into AOSP that it is highly appreciated.
14:16:18 <chris42> Would love to see that for other parts as well. E.g. the location backends. Basically show that a secure and usable implementation is possible.
14:18:40 <chris42> And as next step notifications. Possibly implement something open to show again, that it is possible to do such thing securely. If I approach app developers and ask them to add another mechanism, I always get, there is no better alternative.
14:19:40 <chris42> Sorry for dreaming here... :-D

16:42:20 <cx2[m]> eh, there are worse places to be boring.... like one of the poles? yikes.
16:42:34 <cx2[m]> Not getting gigabit speeds there buddy. you can count on it.
16:44:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Not above ground, anyway....see leaked Kiva data, that's all I've got on that topic.

17:09:25 <brenneke[m]> I have Signal installed from APK on GrapheneOS, should I be blacklisting updates in Aurora?
17:40:51 <skwisgaar[m]> If you wish to update with the apk, then yes. Others have said the apk version will prompt you to update automatically, but this never happened for me, so I use the aurora version.
17:52:12 <dazinism> brenneke: I've found you can install it from pretty much any source. Think they all have the identical apk
17:52:36 <dazinism> Although I've never checked
17:54:30 <dazinism> Guess checking the SHA256 of the apk file would give an idea?
17:54:39 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
17:59:13 <dazinism> I've found that the apk version is scraped by the version Calyx and RFC2822 fdroid repos
17:59:22 <dazinism> https://forum.f-droid.org/t/known-repositories/721
18:00:09 <dazinism> All the same apk signed with the same cert, so any will install over the other.
18:00:30 <JTL> Is the Play Store and website APK identical
18:00:36 <JTL> (in terms of file checksum, etc)
18:00:45 <dazinism> I've not checked
18:00:48 <JTL> Okay
18:02:27 <dazinism> Think I've heard their apk download and Play version are the same apk, but wouldnt like to state that as a fact
18:02:40 <JTL> Right
18:02:52 <dazinism> The apk version does self update
18:03:34 <dazinism> But maybe thats just if it sees you dont have Play?
18:03:41 * JTL shrugs
18:04:57 <dazinism> I've found that the Calyx and RF2822 (thats by one of the DAV5x devs) repos appear to offer updates before it wants to self update.
18:08:28 <cdesai> those repos pull from the site directly, and I guess the app itself might have a backoff
18:08:37 <cdesai> otherwise it could get annoying fast
18:08:58 <Manouchehri> bit off topic, but what getprop flag is it again that enables the OEM unlocking option in the developer options?
18:09:53 <JTL> dazinism: Seems the Signal APK on the website doesn't match the play version, but for starters the "version" number on Play is greater
18:10:19 <JTL> Could be benign laziness of Signal team :p
18:10:49 <rgeturk[m]> signal does staged rollouts, and the website release is the last to get updates
18:10:59 <JTL> right
18:11:10 <JTL> hence the "benign" remark
18:15:52 <Manouchehri> sys.oem_unlock_allowed
18:23:27 <k-sloth[m]> <magicos[m] "Not everything got a web app."> That's painful. Govt products suck. In my home country they use google authentication to log on. Hate it so much
18:36:20 <demonMachina> @appservice-irc:matrtix.org is doing some WORK

18:39:32 <demonMachina> '
19:05:33 <brenneke[m]> <skwisgaar[m] "If you wish to update with the a"> Have never seen that prompt, was using web APK previously when on Nanodroid.
19:13:55 <brenneke[m]> <JTL "dazinism: Seems the Signal APK o"> I will leave it blacklisted for now and keep an eye on it to see if it updates when APK version changes.
19:14:05 <JTL> Yeah okay
19:15:41 <TheJollyRoger> The reason the Signal APK is different than the Play Store APK is because the play store APK's self-updating functionality is not compiled with it.
19:15:59 <TheJollyRoger> GPlay has a standing policy that apps are not supposed to push out of band updates, even for themselves.
19:16:07 <TheJollyRoger> That's very clear in the rules of Google Play.
19:16:37 <TheJollyRoger> If you are to compile from source, something you might notice is that the output will give you a separate APK for play store.
19:16:59 <JTL> Oh right
19:17:04 <JTL> I remember that
19:17:06 <JTL> Silly me
19:17:09 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: Gdau
19:17:11 <JTL> Gday
19:17:49 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!

20:44:49 <bseeinu[m]> overheadscallop: although with all the public instances, the address of the images returns as "localhost" for the files, so they simply don't show up...
20:45:40 <bseeinu[m]> overheadscallop: Plus RSS feeds are disabled on the instance you linked :/
