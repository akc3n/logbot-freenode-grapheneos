00:03:13 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: is there anything I can try testing out in the development branch to help out with? i checked the issues and didn't see anything new?
00:03:40 <aeonsolution[m]>  * strcat: is there anything I can try testing out in the development branch to help out with? i checked the Github issues page and didn't see anything new.
00:05:18 <aeonsolution[m]> should I just try syncing again with the changes and troubleshooting from there?
01:35:18 <renlord> wow, my ovh vps just went kaput
01:35:20 <renlord> for a good 6 hours
01:35:36 <renlord> no outage notice, nothing
01:39:46 <aeonsolution[m]> thats horrible
01:40:01 <aeonsolution[m]> sorry #
01:40:36 <aeonsolution[m]>  * sorry renlord
01:42:26 <JTL> renlord: Which location?
01:42:39 <renlord> SGP
01:43:00 <JTL> That's a more recent location
01:43:17 <JTL> and knowing how OVH works, that doesn't surprise me
01:43:46 <JTL> I seem to recall hearing of similar issues when OVH's Quebec location was newer
01:45:51 <renlord> cant even do a soft reboot in the panel
01:46:05 <renlord> and there's this banner sayting my vps is being upgraded when i didnt even ask for an upgrade
01:46:20 <renlord> and they didnt even announce maintenance or anything
01:46:22 <renlord> ffs
01:53:53 <strcat[m]> aeonsolution: it's thoroughly broken
01:53:56 <strcat[m]> and yes I need help
01:54:13 <strcat[m]> always do
01:56:37 <Caleb> lots of people
01:56:39 <Caleb> nice
01:56:51 <renlord> how do i get a arch user cloak?
01:56:59 <Caleb> ask the right people
01:57:11 <Caleb> not sure they give them out anymore though but i could be wrong
02:00:05 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat: got it, I'm "Extracting vendor files for Pixel devices" step
02:01:11 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: there's like 74 pending issues
02:03:36 <aeonsolution[m]> Sorry, I wasn't being clear renlord. I understood the message as something broke when the changes were pulled into android-prepare-vendor
02:04:08 <aeonsolution[m]> so i looked for new issues on the os-issue tracker or android-prepare-vendor repos and didn't see any
02:04:10 <strcat[m]> no
02:04:12 <strcat[m]> something broke in general
02:04:15 <strcat[m]> the cause is not known
02:04:28 <strcat[m]> there are already problems even if something hadn't broke recently
02:04:40 <strcat[m]> I said I would be rolling back recent changes since the past release
02:05:41 <aeonsolution[m]> noted, thank you for clarifying
02:18:18 <strcat[m]> if there were other people working on the project someone would have noticed the dev branch wasn't working for a while
02:20:45 <aeonsolution[m]> i was able to build 10 for the pixel 3a over the weekend, I can't build it now
02:20:53 <strcat[m]> it still builds fine
02:21:04 <strcat[m]> and maybe you built it but did you TEST it?
02:22:25 <aeonsolution[m]> i didn't do the CTS tests, I started trying to rebuild the dev branch today
02:22:36 <strcat> did you flash it and use it including connecting to a network?
02:22:48 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: it still builds fine
02:22:56 <aeonsolution[m]> i did flash it, but i didn't connect to a network
02:22:57 <strcat> there hasn't been any issue like that - just means you're doing something wrong building it
02:23:30 <strcat> instructions are the same, code is the same
02:23:37 <strcat> if it doesn't build now it's you doing something wrong
02:24:04 <strcat> if there's an error, there's an error message
02:25:24 <renlord> TheJollyRoger: ping
02:25:47 <strcat> valldrac: I think your VPN lockdown change is broken when there isn't a VPN
02:26:04 * TheJollyRoger zooms in.
02:26:07 <aeonsolution[m]> let me restart then; it doesn't error out, this just doesn't work now: `mv vendor/android-prepare-vendor/sargo/QQ2A.200501.001.B2/vendor/google_devices/* vendor/google_devices/`
02:26:21 <strcat> I don't know what you mean by doesn't work
02:26:23 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: ahoy! Sorry about that. I've been away from the PC a lot today >_<. What can I do for you...?
02:26:26 <strcat> if there's an error there's an error message
02:26:34 <TheJollyRoger> I haven't had much luck with Protobuf yet unfortunately, still fighting with my computer.
02:26:38 <aeonsolution[m]> mv: cannot stat 'vendor/android-prepare-vendor/sargo/QQ2A.200501.001.B2/vendor/google_devices/*': No such file or directory
02:26:50 <strcat> ok so you did something wrong there's no directory there
02:27:06 <TheJollyRoger> (cue that gif of Chris Benoit jumping off the top of the cage to try to headbutt Kurt Angle and instead crashing onto his face)
02:27:23 <strcat> the build instructions work and they're the same as before
02:27:30 <strcat> you're just doing something wrong now - do what it says and it'll work
02:27:45 <aeonsolution[m]> kk
02:28:15 <strcat> you shouldn't need to run android-prepare-vendor again if you already had the vendor files for the build id but it WILL WORK if you do it right
02:29:31 <TheJollyRoger> Got it. I'm just missing some dependencies, it seems. Think Python's being picky about google.protobuf and I'm not sure where that's hitting an error so I'm going to try it on a different OS.
02:30:45 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I should be working on a public "container" setup or something for building GrapheneOS within the next 10,000 days
02:31:01 * TheJollyRoger starts playing 10,000 days on full volume!
02:31:06 <JTL> :D
02:31:08 <TheJollyRoger> ^_^
02:31:09 <strcat> it's not really that many dependencies
02:31:23 <TheJollyRoger> Right now I'm thinking if I can build it in a KVM virtual machine, what if I posted the QEMU image somewhere?
02:31:26 <strcat> if people can't get it to build I don't expect them to be able to help
02:31:35 <strcat> building it is the easy part
02:31:35 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. I'm trying, I'm trying >_<.
02:31:44 <renlord> is the protobuf issue related to removing python2 as a dependency?
02:31:47 <aeonsolution[m]> TheJollyRoger: did you switch to Manjaro
02:31:49 <renlord> i can help look into that
02:32:30 <TheJollyRoger> aeonsolution[m]: sorry, not yet. I've been out all day >_< and getting back to work on it now. I tried a few other combinations with Fedora but no success yet, so I'm going to move the VM image.
02:32:37 <renlord> strcat: do we track aosp_alliance avp now as upstream?
02:32:41 <strcat> renlord: yes
02:32:49 <renlord> ok sweet
02:33:04 <renlord> i guess the only missing bit is finding a FT maintainer for the pixel4 kernel?
02:33:16 <renlord> for supporting pixel4?
02:33:27 <strcat> more than the kernel
02:34:09 <strcat> window of opportunity for Pixel 4 / 4 XL / 4a support is closing though
02:34:20 <renlord> oh? but cdesai and danv now use sources available in the aosp tree now for things that already exist in the aosp tree though
02:34:33 <strcat> can't add new devices so close to Android 11
02:34:36 <strcat> renlord: not all things
02:34:40 <strcat> just some
02:34:54 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: I'm uh... I'm not sure what it is. I've got the error message here: https://jollyrogers.ca/public/protobuf.txt . I later tried uninstalling `google`, `google-cloud`, and `protobuf` and then installing them system wide as root. I cleaned out the tmp directory and that fixed the out of space error.
02:35:09 <strcat> you don't need anything called 'google' or 'google-cloud'
02:35:31 <strcat> ImportError: No module named google.protobuf
02:35:33 <renlord> the google namespace exists when you install protobuf
02:35:33 <strcat> there's the error
02:35:54 <strcat> you don't have protobuf for the python being used to run android-prepare-vendor
02:36:07 <renlord> supposedly, but not since the latest debian package
02:36:49 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: the main namespace of a python package != the package name
02:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> OH. Oh wait so... so it's using the wrong interpreter, not finding protobuf, and then erroring out? Like using 3.7 when I have 3.8?
02:36:57 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: and you have the wrong one that's why it doesn't work
02:37:08 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: android-prepare-vendor uses python2
02:38:19 <renlord> whoops, maybe i jumped ahead of myself
02:38:23 <TheJollyRoger> I... oh. Th-th-that... that explains a lot...
02:38:27 <renlord> i thought you're trying to remove python2
02:38:40 * TheJollyRoger smacks himself in the face.
02:38:48 <renlord> py2 should just go away
02:39:08 <strcat> it is
02:39:09 <strcat> it's dead
02:39:24 <strcat> projects using it need to move instead of using a dead project without security updates
02:39:30 <JTL> Agreed
02:39:41 <JTL> The writings been on the wall for a *long time*
02:39:58 <renlord> there is python3-protobuf
02:40:00 <strcat> AOSP has moved already just not retroactively for existing releases
02:40:09 <strcat> renlord: yes the issue is android-prepare-vendor
02:40:11 <strcat> not that
02:40:17 <renlord> should probably look into avp to see if can just patch it
02:43:56 <TheJollyRoger> So now all I gotta figure out is to find protobuf for python2 and install it... let's see..
02:45:01 <strcat> just install a distro package for it
02:45:04 <strcat> it's a common package
02:45:10 <renlord> python2-protobuf
02:45:15 <renlord> on ubuntu
02:45:33 <strcat> there are not that many build dependencies
02:45:39 <strcat> fewer than most small projects
02:46:02 <renlord> fewer than a typical rust project lulz
02:46:08 * TheJollyRoger redfaces.
02:46:41 <strcat> android-prepare-vendor itself has some prebuilts to make it easier
02:46:50 <renlord> strcat: did you have an opinion about cargo when you were a rust contributor?
02:47:22 <strcat> wasn't a fan of it or the people who made it
02:47:35 <strcat> pretty hard-wired into the existence of it now
02:47:43 <renlord> i thought so
02:49:04 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Looks like we might have to rule out Fedora 32 for building until AOSP fully depreciates python2. Fortunately, for the one month I have left I think I can just spin up 30...
02:49:27 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah
02:49:34 <strcat> TheJollyRoger: this isn't a dependency of AOSP on python2
02:49:41 <strcat> android-prepare-vendor isn't AOSP
02:50:06 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
02:50:28 <aeonsolution[m]> i forgot to turn on my swap lol
02:50:33 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
02:50:40 <TheJollyRoger> XP Oops
03:08:19 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just backing up the VM image and then switching it over to Manjaro.
03:09:35 <aeonsolution[m]> nice, let me know if you need anything
03:10:20 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks! I'll use your package list, hopefully I should be able to get everything set here. I think if this goes well I want to publish the VM image somewhere.
03:17:47 <renlord> manjaro is really difficult to use
03:19:03 <TheJollyRoger> Well, heh, looks like I'll be getting this headfirst XP.
03:33:11 <BrokenCog> how so?
04:01:16 <TheJollyRoger> BrokenCog: I've never used Arch or any sort of Arch-Like system before. Hopefully it shouldn't make too much difference in the end though.
04:02:48 <BrokenCog> I was wondeirng why renlord  said difficult to use ... I think you'll be fine.
04:03:30 <TheJollyRoger> Whew.
04:04:44 <renlord> its way harder than archlinux
04:04:44 <renlord> and probably linux from scratch
04:04:46 <renlord> i dont even know how to use it
04:05:09 * TheJollyRoger goes bug-eyed.
04:05:19 <renlord> the community also consistently provides the wrong advice and insecure methods to solving problems
04:05:42 <TheJollyRoger> Ok like... I had to read a little bit about LFS to understand the theory of what I was doing when I set up my system because we didn't have everything available at the time but like...
04:05:45 <TheJollyRoger> that was like...
04:05:46 <aeonsolution[m]> its arch with an installer? he's just using it as a vm not his main os
04:05:50 * TheJollyRoger gestures yanking out his own teeth.
04:06:01 <TheJollyRoger> If it's gonna be harder than THAT aaaaaaa
04:06:01 <renlord> archlinux is so easy, you can install without a fkin installer
04:06:02 <JTL> Didn't they just tell people to roll back the clock when a certificate expired?
04:06:05 <JTL> </snark>
04:06:14 <renlord> i dont even know how to use the debian/ubuntu installer
04:06:16 <aeonsolution[m]> do you have a script you can share?
04:06:32 <JTL> renlord: I still remember the time I installed Gentoo on an old Pentium M laptop about 10 years ago
04:06:37 <JTL> Forgot to compile in the IDE driver
04:06:39 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: what script, its just arch-chroot, pacman -S base done.
04:06:41 <renlord> lol
04:06:45 <TheJollyRoger> ...oh good gravy
04:07:17 <renlord> recovery is so easy with archlinux also
04:07:18 <aeonsolution[m]> is arch-chroot a package?
04:07:26 <aeonsolution[m]> let me check this out
04:07:32 <TheJollyRoger> OK whew. As long as I can get ssh into the VM then I'm fine.
04:07:35 <TheJollyRoger> Should be able to take it from here.
04:07:36 <renlord> should come with the bootable usb
04:07:40 <renlord> but you can install it also
04:07:47 <renlord> arch-install-tools or something
04:08:21 <TheJollyRoger> I left the keymap as "US" so I don't want to bother using it much more than I can, typing in QWERTY feels like walking around with your pants on backwards...
04:08:27 <renlord> when asking for help in manjaro, it always involves steps that require you to bend over backwards
04:08:33 <TheJollyRoger> Oh good gravy.
04:08:35 <renlord> and does not even solve the underlying issue at the first place
04:09:07 <JTL> renlord: Sounds like your describing Debian/Ubuntu people
04:09:26 <renlord> i remember someone telling me one scenario -- cert expiration, they ask you to rollback your OS clock
04:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> sadtrombone.com
04:09:28 <renlord> wtf
04:09:35 <JTL> renlord: Yes that's right
04:09:40 <JTL> (as in the event)
04:09:52 <BrokenCog> does anyone happen to recognize this error:
04:09:53 <BrokenCog> FAILED: ninja: 'external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm/TrichromeChrome.apk', needed by 'out/target/product/generic/obj/APPS/TrichromeChrome_intermediates/package.apk', missing and no known rule to make it
04:10:13 <renlord> BrokenCog: the prebuilt should be included
04:10:21 <BrokenCog> via repo sync?
04:10:42 <BrokenCog> when "m target-files-package
04:10:49 <BrokenCog> starts I get this message:
04:10:52 <BrokenCog> external/vanadium/Android.mk was modified, regenerating...
04:11:15 <BrokenCog> and then that error at the very end.
04:12:59 <renlord> i think so
04:13:41 <renlord> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_vanadium/tree/10/prebuilt/arm64
04:13:44 <renlord> yes
04:13:46 <renlord> they are included
04:17:12 <aeonsolution[m]> renlord:  how long does it take you to setup arch linux from scratch?
04:17:41 <BrokenCog> strange that repo sync didn't pick it up.
04:17:44 <renlord> a working copy?
04:17:45 <renlord> probably 5 mins?
04:18:00 <renlord> then clone my dotfiles, pacman -Syu pkglist.txt done
04:18:09 <renlord> probably all up and running by 30 mins
04:19:05 <aeonsolution[m]> you know all the steps to partition from memory like that?
04:19:14 <TheJollyRoger> Heh, "Arch Linux From Scratch" XP.
04:19:33 <TheJollyRoger> I struggle to set up a Stage 2 :P.
04:19:37 <TheJollyRoger> Er, Stage 3.
04:19:53 <strcat[m]> btw nytimes is officially dropping third party advertising / tracking... since they are moving to first party advertising / tracking and explicitly selling the user data they gather, lol
04:20:18 <BrokenCog> you don't get ads if you have a subscription.
04:20:25 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, well I guess that makes sense...
04:20:43 <TheJollyRoger> >_<.
04:21:07 <TheJollyRoger> I'm just imagining trying to reproduce Arch using LFS and I'm like "oooooh baby, that's for folks braver than I :P"
04:21:11 <JTL> strcat[m]: heh I saw that
04:21:17 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: which just makes it even easier for them to track you
04:21:25 <strcat[m]> not seeing ads != not being tracked
04:21:50 <strcat[m]> especially since the nytimes does first party data collection / profile building and then sells your data (so they are worse than facebook)
04:21:51 <BrokenCog> it's a different type of tracking, true.
04:22:00 <strcat[m]> not a different type of tracking
04:22:04 <strcat[m]> it's more thorough and integrated
04:22:07 <strcat[m]> sure
04:24:36 <BrokenCog> the type of data valuable for resale is predicated on the data being useful for marketing/profit.  If ad's aren't being placed, then the commercial benefit of tracking a person falls to zero.  as long as we like free services (aka: services paid by ad revenue) then we'll have our marketing relevant data tracked and sold.
04:25:16 <BrokenCog> this is part and parcel of a Consumerist based economy, but it crosses over into security, privacy, politics, etc.
04:27:34 <strcat[m]> the data is definitely valuable without ads and blocking the ads doesn't mean they don't record and sell it
04:27:42 <renlord> aeonsolution[m]: disk partitioning?
04:28:06 <strcat[m]> not sure how you can claim that the commercial benefit of tracking people is zero without advertising
04:28:09 <aeonsolution[m]> <renlord "aeonsolution: disk partitioning?"> yeah
04:28:20 <renlord> ya, just use fdisk?
04:28:53 <renlord> then mkfs.(type) partition?
04:31:45 <aeonsolution[m]> i know the steps, im just want to point out that it may not be realistic to tell people to do that
04:32:09 <BrokenCog> renlord: the apk is present:  ./grapheneos-10/external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm64/TrichromeChrome.apk
04:32:19 <aeonsolution[m]> its an unnecessary barrier to development for some
04:32:27 <renlord> BrokenCog: did you set to the correct device?
04:32:38 <renlord> an arm64 device?
04:32:40 <renlord> in choosecombo
04:34:02 <BrokenCog> so, choosecombo: TARGET_ARCH=arm but sync only pulled the 64bits.  okay, that explains the missing file.  need to figure out what happened with sync.
04:34:13 <BrokenCog> thanks.
04:34:14 <renlord> we dont ship arm prebuilts
04:34:16 <renlord> sorry
04:34:20 <renlord> only arm64
04:34:43 <renlord> arm64 and x86_64
04:35:00 <renlord> if you want 32bits, you have to build your own
04:35:05 <renlord> then copy into that directory
04:35:05 <BrokenCog> wouldn't expect them.  what was the last Pixel 32bit?
04:35:34 <renlord> did pixel gen 1 use armv7?
04:35:55 <BrokenCog> don't know.  never messed with pixel until this one.
04:35:59 <BrokenCog> 3a
04:36:25 <renlord> 3a supports 64bit, why do you even bother with arm?
04:36:29 <renlord> just use arm64
04:36:47 <renlord> choosecombo release aosp_sargo user
04:37:05 <renlord> close your shell and start again
04:37:13 <renlord> $ source script/envsetup.sh
04:37:23 <renlord> $ choosecombo release aosp_sargo user
04:38:09 <BrokenCog> I wasn't choosing arm.  tha'ts what I need to figure out.  How did choosecombo get something different.
04:38:27 <BrokenCog> ahhh.. mistype.  Not figure out what happened with sync.  what happened with choosecombo.
04:38:47 <strcat[m]> there was never a 32-bit Pixel
04:38:55 <BrokenCog> well, there you go.
04:39:14 <strcat[m]> Nexus 5X and 6P were 64-bit, as was the Nexus 9 from a year before those
04:39:21 <strcat[m]> Nexus 6 was the last 32-bit Nexus phone
04:39:39 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS never supported the Nexus 6 officially
04:39:43 <strcat[m]> so the Nexus 5 was the last 32-bit device for it
04:39:50 <strcat[m]> which was also the initial device
04:40:40 <strcat[m]> BrokenCog: why are you building for 32-bit arm is the real question
04:40:47 <strcat[m]> we have arm64 and x86_64 prebuilts for Vanadium
04:41:05 <strcat[m]> you can build it for 32-bit but there just isn't a good reason to do it
04:41:08 <BrokenCog> I never claimed to be making 32bit nor asking for.
04:41:19 <BrokenCog> choosecombo claimed it.  not me.
04:42:07 <strcat> Authentication-Results: mail.grapheneos.org; dmarc=fail (p=none dis=none) header.from=gmail.com
04:42:13 <strcat> renlord: opendmarc passes through mails that fail
04:42:14 <TheJollyRoger> It might take some time for rsync to copy everything back to the VM... really glad I don't have to completely set the whole thing back up again from scratch.
04:42:16 <strcat> even though it's set to reject
04:42:18 <strcat> wtf
04:42:52 <strcat> I don't really recommend using a VM just more things that can go wrong
04:43:07 <strcat> build with a normal setup first
04:43:26 <strcat> install / build docs list officially supported distros where it's known to work properly
04:43:34 <strcat> and the instructions are pretty painless, I regularly test them
04:45:42 <renlord> yeah, opendmarc doesnt work very well
04:45:56 <renlord> even opendkim exemptdomains dont work well
04:46:09 <renlord> i exempted the linuxfoundation mailing lists but its still rejecting them
04:46:26 <strcat> renlord: remember it's for FROM addresses
04:46:30 <strcat> it's not for mail servers
04:46:34 <strcat> it doesn't exempt their server
04:46:50 <strcat> so you'd need to whitelist every address of people using broken mailing lists
04:46:58 <renlord> the FROM address is the mailing list address
04:47:02 <strcat> it's really up to them to NOT use broken mailing lists forging emails if they do
04:47:08 <strcat> renlord: and they don't do dkim properly?
04:47:09 <renlord> from *@lists.linuxfoundation.org
04:47:14 <renlord> i suppose not
04:47:16 <renlord> lol
04:47:27 <renlord> i dont keep bounced emails
04:47:51 <TheJollyRoger> strcat: okay :(. Got it >_<.
04:48:07 * TheJollyRoger goes to get another hard drive...
04:48:23 <strcat> why can't you just build on whatever your normal OS is
04:49:43 <BrokenCog> because if your host machine is involved with X number of projects, with conflicting library/versions/firmware/configuration overlaps, it becomes impossible.
04:50:04 <strcat> there are hardly any build dependencies on the host
04:50:08 <TheJollyRoger> Crap. Well, I'll go and try to find python2-protobuf for this thing.
04:50:13 <BrokenCog> hardly.  but a few.
04:50:14 <TheJollyRoger> THat's the only thing that this thing is choking on so far.
04:50:27 <strcat> AOSP builds in a sandbox with namespaces and doesn't leak that much from the host
04:50:33 <BrokenCog> TheJollyRoger: what distro?
04:50:51 <TheJollyRoger> If not though, I've got one more 1TB SSD left, and I can just throw Debian Busted-- uh, sorry, I mean Debian Buster onto this thing.
04:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Gentoo. T_T
04:50:59 <strcat> and you can build in your own container too
04:51:05 <strcat> there is no good reason to make things so complicated
04:51:15 <strcat> stop making things overcomplicated as step one
04:51:20 <strcat> follow the instructions as written
04:51:23 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
04:51:30 <strcat> there was a time when GrapheneOS releases were not available, just sources
04:51:43 <strcat> and many people including many non-programmers built it successfully via instructions inferior to what's there now
04:51:55 <strcat> the instructions are far better now and there are *far fewer* build dependencies
04:53:24 <renlord> i just use a container now
04:53:32 <renlord> so i dont need all the extra baggage on my host OS
04:53:50 <renlord> not that its alot to begin with
04:54:06 <strcat> just make a fresh arch container (pacstrap -c build base)
04:54:31 <strcat> only setup I did is enabling/generating en_US.UTF-8 locale and making a grapheneos user
04:54:44 <strcat> step one installed repo, python3, git to init/sync
04:55:17 <strcat> there it goes
04:55:44 <strcat> can literally copy-paste the 4 sync commands
04:55:55 <strcat> I have fiber so it goes pretty fast
04:59:00 <renlord> i just use the debian buster image
05:01:02 <strcat> renlord: I just install arch-install-scripts and use pacstrap -c dir base
05:01:21 <strcat> renlord: it uses your existing package cache and mirrorlist
05:01:43 <strcat> renlord: then, systemd-nspawn -D dir, do the setup as root
05:01:49 <strcat> then switch to the non-root user
05:01:59 <renlord> but your host package cache shouldnt have the build dependencies at the first place?
05:02:22 <strcat> I mean it uses your host package cache for pacstrap
05:02:33 <renlord> i see you use lxc directly
05:02:35 <renlord> i still use docker
05:02:38 <strcat> why does it matter if not everything is there
05:02:43 <strcat> renlord: systemd-nspawn isn't lxc
05:03:03 <strcat> could use something else but that works directly with an OS tree
05:03:05 <strcat> nothing special
05:03:22 <strcat> could also use debootstrap if you wanted debian but this is faster and I don't have to deal with debian
05:03:40 <renlord> what's the size?
05:04:35 <strcat> 600M for base but you don't really need all of base
05:04:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <renlord "i just use a container now"> Is your container's creation script anywhere?
05:04:38 <strcat> don't need linux, etc.
05:05:51 <renlord> DannyWorkOrderPr: no its in my local
05:06:28 <strcat> pacstrap -c build-tree base python3 git gcc binutils bc diffutils freetype2 ttf-dejavu m4 rsync unzip zip signify
05:06:37 <strcat> and install ncurses5-compat-libs
05:07:30 <strcat> and the lib for android-prepare-vendor
05:07:36 <strcat> it's pretty straightforward
05:07:39 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <renlord "Danny@WorkOrderPro: no its in my"> What I mean is, would you be willing to share a script to make your Docker environment, a la DockerHub or whatever hotness is these days?
05:07:57 <strcat> we could rebuild the renderscript clang to avoid the ncurses5 dep
05:08:25 <strcat> you don't need some fancy environment
05:08:29 <strcat> the build environment is not complicated
05:08:32 <strcat> look at what I just posted
05:08:36 <renlord> DannyWorkOrderPr: i can probably submit a PR for it, but its quite basic
05:09:09 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
05:09:29 <renlord> but just use strcat's systemd-nspawn approac
05:09:50 <strcat> either make an arch (pacstrap) or debian (debootstrap) container and systemd-nspawn
05:09:56 <strcat> if you really want to build in a container
05:10:00 <strcat> you need a dozen packages, that's it
05:10:46 <strcat> if you want to build how I build use pacstrap
05:11:03 <strcat> since people always want to do that for some reason even though the build requirements are really minimal
05:11:59 <strcat> alright it finished syncing a while ago
05:12:35 <strcat> building bonito kernel
05:23:22 <renlord> til, there's a slub and slab allocator
05:23:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "if you really want to build in a"> I'd really like to be able to script setting up the environment, one way or another (Docker popular for this) so I could switch to new hardware regularly with minimal friction
05:23:37 <renlord> always thought they referred to different type of data structures
05:24:10 <renlord> DannyWorkOrderPr: script/envsetup.sh does setup the environment
05:24:15 <renlord> and choosecombo too
05:25:04 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <renlord "Danny@WorkOrderPro: script/envse"> Dope, thanks. I need to take a closer look at the instructions. Only page I haven't read every single bit of, yet.
05:25:12 <renlord> is openprivacy.ca a credible research group?
05:25:14 <DannyWorkOrderPr> (on GrapheneOS.org)
05:25:32 <JTL> renlord: Based in Western Canada
05:25:41 <aeonsolution[m]> i figured out the issue, i didnt lower case the build id in the mv command
05:25:44 <aeonsolution[m]> im building now
05:26:07 <JTL> renlord: What exactly are you concerned with?
05:26:34 <renlord> just curious
05:26:46 <aeonsolution[m]> i want to say that the envsetup script, would lowercase the build_id before
05:36:46 <strcat> no
05:37:04 <strcat> it's android-prepare-vendor that lowercases it
05:37:06 <strcat> for the output
05:37:11 <strcat> but you can just autocomplete it anyway
05:37:38 <aeonsolution[m]> right
05:37:41 <aeonsolution[m]> thank you
07:36:43 * mrxx_0[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200519_213500_669.jpg (8KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/epORphoDEShosTSzjnrnSDQx >
07:36:51 <mrxx_0[m]> Little wallpaper :)
07:37:15 <mrxx_0[m]> (From Techlore video)
07:37:57 <cyredanthem[m]> Techlore banned me I think. I didn't even say anything probably since I'm in the pro security gang
07:38:35 <mrxx_0[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Techlore banned me I think. I di"> Wut ? From his irc ? Because he has a telegram channel too
07:39:53 <cyredanthem[m]> The matrix group
07:39:56 <cyredanthem[m]> I dunno
07:40:54 <blacklight447[m]> Update so far: if tried to reach out to purism two days ago regarding severe security issues with their librem.one service
07:41:15 <JTL> blacklight447[m]: What now?
07:41:22 <blacklight447[m]> So far, i have yet to get any response whatsoever
07:41:40 <JTL> Can't say I'm too surprised since it seems Purism scared off the actually competent people from working for them
07:42:09 <blacklight447[m]> <JTL "blacklight447: What now?"> Their email server fails minimum security requirements
07:42:43 <JTL> Right
07:42:45 <blacklight447[m]> They dont support dkim and dmarc, making it super easy to spoof
07:42:56 <JTL> Unsurprising really
07:43:06 <strcat> JTL: I noticed they don't have authenticated encryption for TLS (no DANE or even MTA-STS), DNSSEC, DKIM/DMARC, etc
07:43:22 <JTL> That doesn't surprise me :|
07:43:27 <strcat> they call crappy opt-in, optional GPG integration 'bleeding edge' encryption lol
07:43:31 <blacklight447[m]> They don't have dnssec, dane or mta sts, making it damn easy to mitm and force them to send all mails via unencrypted smtp
07:43:37 <strcat> GPG is a joke and they don't even do a good job of it
07:43:43 <JTL> I've noticed
07:43:45 <strcat> and it barely covers any emails in practice
07:43:54 <blacklight447[m]> Their starttls policy has some weird choices
07:44:09 <strcat> it has some outdated SSL3 protocol enabled
07:44:10 <strcat> for TLS1.2
07:44:12 <strcat> weird stuff
07:44:12 <blacklight447[m]> Like who the hell uses/allows TLS_DH_ANON
07:44:23 <JTL> Not me
07:44:26 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: dunno never seen a setup like that
07:44:29 <strcat> it's pretty weird
07:44:47 <JTL> I guess thats what you get when you just slap Debian on a server and follow random guides from the internet? :P
07:44:54 <mrxx_0[m]> strcat how did you start in security and android ?
07:45:00 <strcat> bare minimum is MTA-STS + DKIM + DMARC quarantine + SPF + inbound DMARC enforcement
07:45:18 <strcat> making it good requires more work including DANE - both inbound and outbound, and other things
07:45:40 <blacklight447[m]> Lmao, the only thing they did correctly is configuring spf
07:45:41 <strcat> and ofc keeping things properly is part of that baseline bare minimum
07:45:49 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: SPF without DNSSEC is not correct
07:46:07 <blacklight447[m]> But as they dont do dnssec, they can be completely subverted
07:46:08 <strcat> and you have to put an SPF record for every A / AAAA / MX record
07:46:18 <strcat> every subdomain needs an SPF record
07:46:28 <strcat> it doesn't apply to subdomains
07:46:33 <blacklight447[m]> Right
07:46:49 <strcat> lets say you have bar.com with an SPF record at the top level
07:46:54 <blacklight447[m]> Heh, didnt even notice that one
07:46:59 <strcat> but you have a.bar.com, b.bar.com, c.b.bar.com
07:47:08 <strcat> well, someone can send fake emails from all 3 of those bypassing SPF
07:47:13 <strcat> since SPF only applies to top level
07:47:27 <strcat> and without DMARC, SPF is basically useless anyway
07:47:40 <strcat> it's not enforced in practice even with a hard fail policy
07:47:45 <blacklight447[m]> I see
07:47:55 <strcat> and if it's not a hard fail policy *and* no DMARC... it's even more useless
07:48:11 <strcat> soft fail doesn't matter if you use DMARC since it's DMARC doing any enforcement
07:48:27 <blacklight447[m]> But yeah, im just gonna try and reach out to them via some other channels
07:48:36 <strcat> but I think it should be hard fail just so SPF alone provides basic protection - but it's annoying cause you have to add a record for each A / AAAA / MX record
07:48:42 <strcat> every single subdomain needs an SPF record
07:48:50 <blacklight447[m]> If i don't get any response, an article on privacytools is going up exposing their wrong doing
07:48:56 <strcat> if you have  CNAME record, that DELEGATES to where it points which is problematic
07:49:05 <strcat> the place it points needs an SPF record
07:49:15 <blacklight447[m]> They claim security, therefore atrracting folks with high security models to their service
07:49:24 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: I mean as far as I'm concerned that's their overall approach to EVERYTHING
07:49:27 <strcat> they are scammers imo
07:49:38 <JTL> Good luck getting "random vendor" to proeprly setup SPF record for their CNAME
07:49:40 <blacklight447[m]> But as they lack these minimum security requirements, they are truly endangering people
07:49:41 <strcat> they never gave a shit about issues I reported to them
07:49:52 <strcat> JTL: yeah best to not point CNAMES at anything to avoid delegating
07:49:57 <blacklight447[m]> I wonder if they realise the magnitude and impact of their terrible decisions
07:50:09 <strcat> JTL: so for example bing webmaster tools for some reason uses a CNAME record to verify
07:50:13 <strcat> instead of a TXT record
07:50:14 <strcat> it's dumb
07:50:25 <JTL> strcat: Like I've mentioned, the actual competent people left or were fired over a year ago so I'd expeect nothing from them
07:50:30 <strcat> instead of making _bing-webmaster-tools.site.com TXT record
07:50:31 <JTL> strcat: that is so dumb
07:50:33 <strcat> they have you make
07:50:49 <strcat> adsgjsdalgjls9482yt894ygpwernjserjioghr23490.site.com CNAME pointing to verify.bing.com
07:50:51 <strcat> makes NO SENSE
07:51:15 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "JTL: so for example bing webmast"> But... Then you completely fall outside of the spf standard right?
07:51:32 <blacklight447[m]> As far as i know, it needs to be a txt
07:51:41 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: this is not tied to email
07:51:50 <strcat> just how they verify ownership of a domain for bing webmaster tools
07:51:57 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: the issue is that if you have a CNAME pointing elsewhere
07:52:00 <strcat> it *delegates* SPF to them
07:52:16 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: so there will be a lookup of where it points
07:52:24 <strcat> to see if they have a TXT record
07:52:27 <strcat> for spf
07:52:34 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: which bing does not have on that subdomain
07:52:41 <blacklight447[m]> Aaah
07:52:47 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: and even if it did I don't want to delegate trust to them like that
07:52:59 <JTL> fair
07:53:01 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: also by default with normal DMARC
07:53:07 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: it uses relaxed SPF and DKIM enforcement
07:53:10 <strcat> if you don't opt-in to strict
07:53:26 <strcat> with strict they can only send mail as adsgjsdalgjls9482yt894ygpwernjserjioghr23490.site.com
07:53:40 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: i.e. despite having DMARC bing can send email as you since you pointed a CNAME at them
07:53:46 <strcat> but without STRICT policy for DMARC
07:53:55 <strcat> they can also send email as site.com at least for SPF
07:55:35 <strcat> ;; ANSWER SECTION:
07:55:36 <strcat> _dmarc.grapheneos.org. 3600 IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; adkim=s; aspf=s; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc⊙go; ruf=mailto:dmarc⊙go"
07:55:47 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: adkim=s; aspf=s makes it strict
07:56:02 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: anyways important to understand how *fucked* email is
07:56:32 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: running an email server securely requires a fair bit of knowledge / setup
07:56:39 <strcat> postfix is the best way
07:57:26 <renlord> mail provider can almost never do strict enformcenent for dkim
07:57:34 <renlord> their users will miss out on too many emails
07:57:41 <renlord> for inbound especially.
07:57:44 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "blacklight447: running an email "> Fun fact, im a guy barely out of college, but im giving you a fair bet that if i were to run an email service, it would have been done way more properly then purism has done now
07:57:48 <strcat> renlord: DMARC deals with that
07:57:53 <strcat> if they say reject you should reject
07:57:58 <strcat> renlord: opendmarc doesn't work properly tho
07:58:00 <strcat> I need to figure that out
07:58:03 <renlord> ya, but people say reject when they dont mean to
07:58:05 <renlord> lol
07:58:06 <blacklight447[m]> Its like they threw up a digital ocean droplet and bought the librem.one domain
07:58:12 <renlord> broken dmarc policies everywhere
07:58:21 <JTL> blacklight447[m]: pretty much
07:58:28 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: and put some insecure mail server + put SPF record for top level domain
07:58:34 <strcat> no inbound SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement
07:58:38 <strcat> no DKIM/DMARC for their mails
07:58:40 <renlord> and opendkim ignores dmarc no? if there's a invalidated dkim signature, it'll just reject
07:58:41 <strcat> improper TLS setup
07:58:42 <blacklight447[m]> And never dealt with any proper configuration, and called it a day
07:58:43 <renlord> lol
07:58:48 <strcat> no TLS authentication (no MTA-STS, no DANE)
07:58:50 <strcat> no DNSSEC
07:58:57 <strcat> I bet it has more issues than this
07:59:00 <strcat> this is just the surface of it
07:59:11 <blacklight447[m]> "We did it guys, we now have a secure email service"! (Just only pray and hope nobody actually tries to audit us)
07:59:37 <renlord> secure email is tough to pull off, because your neighbour MTAs might not even co-operate with you
07:59:51 <renlord> decentralized network yo
07:59:56 <cyredanthem[m]> Email is stupid and should never be used
07:59:56 <blacklight447[m]> Do you think they even update their server properly?
08:00:01 <strcat> renlord: you don't need to enable reject for opendkim if DMARC is properly implemented
08:00:03 <strcat> cause basically
08:00:10 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm tempted to go Gmail I trust them most to not fuck up security
08:00:12 <strcat> the DMARC implementation is supposed to reject if the policy is reject
08:00:20 <blacklight447[m]> <renlord "secure email is tough to pull of"> Yeah, email is as secure as the weakest link in the chain
08:00:25 <renlord> strcat: does your opendmarc work to expectation?
08:00:29 <strcat> renlord: DMARC adds alignment checks + enforcement for SPF and DKIM
08:00:36 <strcat> renlord: kinda
08:00:39 <strcat> it fails when it should
08:00:41 <strcat> passes when it should
08:00:43 <strcat> but...
08:00:48 <renlord> havent had a fail case so far
08:00:50 <strcat> it does not reject emails it's like it ignores my configuration
08:00:50 <renlord> for dmarc
08:01:02 <strcat> renlord: if DKIM fails, DMARC will fail if there is a DMARC policy, etc.
08:01:05 <strcat> same for SPF
08:02:35 <strcat> renlord: btw DMARC needs *either* SPF or DKIM
08:02:47 <strcat> I dunno if there's a way to make it force both
08:03:03 <renlord> shouldnt it be both?
08:03:15 <strcat> renlord: I think it requires that EITHER is valid
08:03:19 <strcat> and aligned to the FROM address
08:03:33 <blacklight447[m]> If one party fucks up, all is fucked up
08:03:34 <blacklight447[m]> Question: if two mail servers sending email to eachother both have dane and starttls, and spf configured, would dkim still be of much use?
08:03:45 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: well DMARC is mandatory
08:03:59 <strcat> you need DMARC + SPF or DMARC + DKIM
08:04:04 <blacklight447[m]> I mean if mail is sended over tls anyway, any alterations will turn to email into jibberish right?
08:04:17 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: but someone else can send mail *as you*
08:04:32 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: DANE and MTA-STS are enforced by the MTA sending mail
08:04:38 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: the server never validates the client with TLS
08:04:41 <blacklight447[m]> I see
08:04:41 <cyredanthem[m]> Email is so very dumb
08:04:42 <blacklight447[m]> Good point
08:04:42 <strcat> there is no client cert
08:04:54 <strcat> DANE / MTA-STS don't let the server receiving mail check client
08:05:12 <strcat> the only check for the client is SPF / DKIM
08:05:23 <strcat> and someone could fake a connection from you and bypass SPF
08:05:26 <blacklight447[m]> I was only considering the "proving the email has been altered in transit" part of dkim here
08:05:28 <strcat> email is FUCKED
08:05:48 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: I've been thinking that it may make sense to only use DKIM + DMARC instead of SPF + DKIM + DMARC
08:05:54 <blacklight447[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Email is so very dumb"> What did you expact, its a protocal from the 80s
08:06:05 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: but some places may enforce SPF but not DMARC
08:06:07 <strcat> so...
08:06:09 <strcat> that would be bad
08:06:11 <blacklight447[m]> Its like trying to make sms secure, its almost impossible
08:06:21 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: but afaik DMARC enforces having EITHER valid SPF or DKIM
08:06:25 <strcat> and SPF is not very secure
08:06:46 <cyredanthem[m]> School supplied email. Gmail for anything government based. Outlook for anything work related. Fuck off if you aren't one of them
08:08:07 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "blacklight447: but some places m"> So, basically, its just like with choosing to support dane or mta sts
08:08:09 <blacklight447[m]> Dkim with dmarc is fine
08:08:27 <blacklight447[m]> But as some folks may not support dkim, we better support spf as well
08:08:33 <renlord> ok i changed it around again
08:08:40 <renlord> i'll let dmarc do the rejecting
08:08:46 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: DANE / MTA-STS is authenticated encryption - avoids leaking message or tampering with it along the way
08:08:48 <blacklight447[m]> Similarly, dane is better, but some folks only do mta sts, so we may better support that as well
08:08:52 <renlord> the testing flag does not even work properly in opendkim
08:08:58 <renlord> it just behaves like reject
08:09:17 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: DKIM is authentication for the message but without a way to mandate it so someone could send a non-DKIM signed message which would at best be a spam signal for a spam filter
08:09:18 <strcat> AT BEST
08:09:34 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: SPF in hard fail validates it APPEARS to come from a certain IP address
08:09:35 <blacklight447[m]> <renlord "it just behaves like reject"> Its a but buggy in my experience as well
08:09:38 <strcat> but that's not secure vs MITM
08:09:52 <strcat> DMARC enforces that either SPF or DKIM matches the domain and is valid
08:10:09 <strcat> I want a way to force both but I don't think that is supported
08:11:05 <blacklight447[m]> Makes you wonder why though
08:11:06 <renlord> strcat: if you want both, you can always tell dkim to reject bad signatures
08:11:15 <blacklight447[m]> Seems like such a straight forward thing to support
08:11:16 <strcat> renlord: DKIM is not mandatory
08:11:34 <renlord> sure, then emails without dkim will fallback to spf checks only using dmarc
08:11:48 <strcat> renlord: I have SPF enforcement (rejects hard fail, tempfails failure to get policy, etc.)
08:11:49 <renlord> note: only rejecting bad dkim signatures
08:11:51 <strcat> and DKIM enforcement
08:11:53 <strcat> and DMARC enforcement
08:12:00 <blacklight447[m]> Then again, even if you find a way to set your dmarc policy to require both, you need other MTA s recieving it to actually listen to it
08:12:04 <strcat> but DKIM is not mandatory - there isn't a record saying 'must be dkim signed'
08:12:17 <strcat> and DMARC allows either SPF or DKIM - doesn't force both
08:12:31 <strcat> so I am concerned that someone able to MITM can send spoofed mails with 'valid' SPF
08:12:35 <strcat> hmm
08:12:38 <renlord> strcat: do you mean you only want to receive dkim-signed emails?
08:12:47 <strcat> renlord: no I want to prevent people sending spoofed mails
08:12:50 <strcat> via MITM
08:13:08 <strcat> renlord: if they can pretend the message came from the IP of mail.grapheneos.org it will pass SPF
08:13:18 <strcat> renlord: and they can just not DKIM sign it
08:13:22 <strcat> and afaik that will pass DMARC
08:13:32 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "but DKIM is not mandatory - ther"> So your dkim record cannot state that its mandatory, do i understand that right?
08:13:43 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: yes because there is not really  "a DKIM record"
08:13:50 <renlord> how do you do that? dont you need to do the HELO/OLEH Challenge response with a SMTP server?
08:13:51 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: the signed emails refer to a record
08:13:58 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: if they aren't signed, there is nothing to refer to
08:14:09 <renlord> then when they do the PTR checks and what not, the ip spoofer will fail
08:14:19 <blacklight447[m]> Ah, right, forgot about that
08:14:29 <strcat> renlord: is that TLS authenticated via MTA-STS / DANE?
08:14:34 <strcat> I guess so
08:14:44 <blacklight447[m]> Wonder why they implemented it that way
08:14:50 <renlord> yes, if they talk with smtps
08:15:00 <strcat> yeah that makes sense
08:15:00 <renlord> if not, helo/oleh into starttls
08:15:05 <renlord> still interactive
08:15:30 <blacklight447[m]> Why didnt they just implement it that if the mta recieves an email, it just checks that @domain s dns records for dkim or spf
08:16:00 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: b/c people have super complex email setups
08:16:18 <blacklight447[m]> Doesnt that make more sense then relying on what headers are in the email to see what to look up?
08:16:24 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: basically with SPF enforcement -> receive email -> check subdomain for SPF policy -> enforce if hard fail (or maybe mark it if soft fail)
08:16:35 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: DKIM is an OPTION to sign emails
08:16:39 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: if the email is signed
08:16:40 <renlord> blacklight447[m]: i can strip your headers along the way
08:16:42 <strcat> it refers to where to get the key
08:16:43 <renlord> lol
08:16:48 <blacklight447[m]> Great, just what we need, more complexity...
08:16:58 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: it's possible to have multiple DKIM signatures
08:17:03 <strcat> or relays might replace / remove it
08:17:06 <strcat> as they change the email and so on
08:17:08 <blacklight447[m]> When learning about these email security measures, i was so hopefull
08:17:12 <strcat> it's complicated
08:17:25 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: but yeah need DANE / MTA-STS + SPF + DKIM + DMARC to prevent spoofing I guess
08:17:32 <blacklight447[m]> But my hopes are getting lower by the day
08:17:38 <strcat> having just SPF + DKIM + DMARC does not prevent spoofing by a MITM attacker
08:17:41 <strcat> need DANE / MTA-STS too
08:17:43 <renlord> strcat: i havent been getting mta-sts reports
08:17:49 <strcat> and then you need all of this for the other way around
08:17:53 <renlord> does that mean people are not using it to contact me using smpts?
08:17:53 <strcat> renlord: send yourself an email from gmail
08:17:56 <strcat> renlord: only google sends them
08:18:05 <renlord> i receive many mail from gmail.com
08:18:14 <renlord> but i dont get any reports
08:18:15 <strcat> renlord: you should get mta-sts reports if you set up tls reporting then
08:18:22 <renlord> i do have tls reporting!
08:18:22 <strcat> I get reports
08:18:32 <strcat> renlord: double check that you can receive that that address
08:18:40 <strcat> renlord: check with https://aykevl.nl/apps/mta-sts/
08:18:45 <strcat> that your policy works
08:18:50 <renlord> ya i passed 100% all these tests
08:18:53 <strcat> put grapheneos.org there
08:18:57 <strcat> Policy: v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:tls-rpt⊙go
08:19:00 <strcat> I get mails there
08:19:08 <blacklight447[m]> Fun how, even if we configure everything right, if you were to send an email to librem.one, moest of your efforts go into the trash :D
08:19:22 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: yep no authenticated TLS
08:19:24 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: but also
08:19:28 <renlord>  v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:email-security⊙rc
08:19:32 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: if people spoof @grapheneos.org they can send mail there and they won't reject it
08:19:33 <renlord> dont get any :(
08:19:47 <strcat> root@mail:/home/tls-rpt# ls Maildir/new/
08:19:49 <strcat> 1589624383.V801I40b92M915367.mail  1589710599.V801I40febM508375.mail  1589796300.V801I400d2M864633.mail  1589884659.V801I400ddM819529.mail

08:20:39 <strcat> I don't have mutt set up to check tls-rpt@ and dmarc@
08:20:46 <strcat> I split them into separate users
08:20:56 <blacklight447[m]> Btw, i though smtps was just used to start a secure connection to your mta from your mua, and then starttls is used to make a secure connection  for smtp to send the email to from your mta to another
08:21:02 <renlord> i have virtual that routes them all to my main
08:21:05 <strcat> security@ contact@ root@ postmaster@ etc. all go to daniel.micay@
08:21:11 <strcat> renlord: well I have aliases for those
08:21:15 <strcat> I just use /etc/aliases lol
08:21:20 <blacklight447[m]> Is this not how this works?
08:21:22 <strcat> I don't have virtual mails and I just use maildir
08:21:38 <strcat> another option is just letting dovecot store mails itself
08:21:48 <strcat> by using deliver to dovecot and using the dovecot db
08:21:58 <strcat> probably more efficient than maildir but I like not being tied to dovecot
08:22:03 <renlord> virtual storing using maildir format
08:22:25 <renlord> dovecot is quite complicated
08:22:36 <strcat> renlord: where does virtual store stuff
08:22:41 <renlord> vmail
08:22:47 <strcat> where is that?
08:22:54 <renlord> /home/vmail on disk?
08:22:57 <strcat> ah
08:23:03 <strcat> I guess I could set up virtual but meh
08:23:06 <renlord> so yeah, maildir format
08:23:19 <strcat> renlord: well I alias everything to daniel.micay@ and that's a user
08:23:26 <strcat> so it mostly goes into /home/daniel.micay
08:23:26 <renlord> then i used imap sync to push my current folder layout into my mail host
08:23:48 <renlord> so the setup now is very compatible with my old mail provider
08:23:54 <strcat> root: daniel.micay
08:23:56 <strcat> contact: root
08:23:58 <strcat> caa: root
08:24:00 <strcat> renlord: at the top of /etc/aliases
08:24:04 <strcat> and I run 'newaliases' to update /etc/aliases.db
08:24:23 <strcat> renlord: and it already has the standard ones like abuse, noc, security, postmaster, hostmaster, webmaster, www
08:24:28 <renlord> dont like to use aliases since i need to create users for each
08:24:34 <renlord> virtual is easier
08:24:40 <strcat> renlord: you don't need users for each
08:24:43 <strcat> aliases work without users
08:25:23 <renlord> my mail host also supports 2 different domains
08:25:32 <renlord> so virtual actually fits better for me
08:25:38 <strcat> renlord: /etc/aliases is a mapping from address@ (on every host) -> username
08:25:41 <blacklight447[m]> Lmao see this dude
08:25:52 <blacklight447[m]> I called him out on his purism librem recommendation, naming their lack of microcode updates a security risk
08:25:53 <renlord> if you do a look up on me my MX provider is actually katmail.xyz lol
08:26:09 <strcat> so since I have contact@ there, it maps contact⊙aa, contact⊙go, contact⊙sa, contact⊙mgo -> daniel.micay user
08:26:14 * blacklight447[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200520-102423.png (299KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/LFmXIGiSVsVmOtYFLeklJSDy >
08:26:36 <blacklight447[m]> Apperently his "proffesional opinion" is that because microcode updates are a responsive measure, they dont matter
08:26:50 <renlord> the nightmare ovh this morning made me consider setting up a 2nd fallback mail hos
08:27:01 <renlord> fkin hell, all of the sudden cant even boot into rescue/soft reboot the vps
08:27:11 <renlord> out for a good 6 hours
08:27:16 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: microcode updates fix various vulnerabilities
08:27:20 <strcat> not just spectre issues
08:27:32 <strcat> not having microcode code == bunch of serious vulnerabilities unpatched
08:27:37 <strcat> and the microcode is there either way
08:27:42 <blacklight447[m]> Then why install any security updates at all, those are responsive as well, the argument doesn't add up at all
08:28:05 <renlord> unless librem plan to design their own SoC, i dont think their marketing is honest at all
08:28:05 <cyredanthem[m]> Blacklight please fix ptio it's broken
08:28:11 <strcat> lets say there WAS a microcode backdoor - a microcode might be able to fix it if it doesn't stop updating microcode
08:28:35 <strcat> renlord: their laptops don't have open source schematics, boards, etc.
08:28:41 <strcat> it's not just the components that are closed source
08:28:49 <strcat> CPU, GPU, Wi-Fi, motherboard, etc. all closed source
08:28:51 <strcat> not just that
08:28:52 <blacklight447[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Blacklight please fix ptio it's "> Im gonna need a few more details, lol
08:28:56 <strcat> even the case itself, etc. are closed source
08:28:59 <strcat> there is nothing open about it
08:29:00 <renlord> lol
08:29:18 <renlord> the least they can do is let me 3d print the fkin case
08:29:25 <renlord> on thingverse or someshit
08:29:26 <strcat> 96boards boards are at least open source boards
08:29:29 <strcat> not components ON the boards
08:29:39 <strcat> and btw that's enough for something to quality as 'open hardware' per that stupid org
08:29:41 <strcat> it's dumb
08:30:02 <blacklight447[m]> <renlord "unless librem plan to design the"> Fun fact, they could have chosen to go with RISC-v and design their own soc, its a free isa and is designed to be easily scaled down to small devices
08:30:04 <renlord> the kirin960 SoC is not open source is it?
08:30:10 <strcat> it's not open
08:30:15 <strcat> no ARM SoC is open

08:30:15 <cyredanthem[m]> Bromite should be at the top of mobile. Lineage should have a warning due to misleading practices. Chromium should be recommended with a few privacy tweaks. Safari should be recommended. Replicant should be removed
08:30:17 <blacklight447[m]> Yet they went the easy way choose an arm platform from nxp
08:30:25 <renlord> well yeah exactly
08:30:36 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: a super low quality / insecure one compared to status quo
08:31:14 <cyredanthem[m]> Lineage should be worth mentioning not recommended
08:31:56 <blacklight447[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "Lineage should be worth mentioni"> Ive tried bringing that up to the team but couldn't convince them to remove it
08:31:57 <cyredanthem[m]> CalyxOS should be recommended due to Pixel 4 support being on the way which gives it a use case where it can be usable when GrapheneOS is not
08:32:16 <cyredanthem[m]> Gotcha well thanks for trying
08:32:33 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: 'on the way' is the same status as GrapheneOS support for it
08:32:53 <renlord> calyx, rattlesnake and graphene are all tracking the work in aosp_alliance
08:32:56 <strcat> and the intention is that people purchase a device for GrapheneOS anyway
08:33:33 <cyredanthem[m]> I don't think a group that actively lies about security patches should be on a privacy website at all
08:33:36 <blacklight447[m]> Im firdt gonna try and add a warninf label
08:33:36 <cyredanthem[m]> That's a start
08:33:37 <cyredanthem[m]> Glad to hear it
08:33:46 <cyredanthem[m]> Any chance of a Chromium based option on desktop? blacklight447
08:33:48 <cyredanthem[m]> > cyredanthem: 'on the way' is the same status as GrapheneOS support for it
08:33:48 <cyredanthem[m]> I thought they were going to try to get it out this week?
08:33:49 <strcat> blacklight447[m]: also disabling multi-threading is not good enough lol
08:33:58 <strcat> clueless person
08:34:10 <strcat> how do they expect to disabling multi-threading
08:34:16 <strcat> i.e. run an OS with 1 thread?
08:34:18 <strcat> makes no sense
08:34:18 <cyredanthem[m]> I purchased one for GrapheneOS no regrets
08:34:30 <strcat> they are going to use a cooperatively scheduled OS in a single process in 2020?
08:34:38 <cyredanthem[m]> > calyx, rattlesnake and graphene are all tracking the work in aosp_alliance
08:34:38 <cyredanthem[m]> What's that?
08:34:45 <strcat> I think they mean disabling multicore/HT but that is not at all good enough
08:35:17 <renlord> do a tlb/cache flush every context switch
08:35:20 <renlord> lol
08:35:26 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "clueless person"> You d be surprised how many folks see them selves as security experts these days
08:35:50 <strcat> bunch of ignorant / dishonest people everywhere, yeah
08:35:57 <strcat> on tons of topics
08:35:58 <strcat> not just this
08:36:10 <blacklight447[m]> Im at the ptio team, ive studied security and networking and are working with it daily, yet i don't even consider myself an expert yet
08:36:14 <strcat> internet is just making people more ignorant / clueless
08:36:29 <strcat> access to more information does not make people more informed cause they just pick and choose information aligning with their bias / beliefs
08:36:32 <strcat> and make themselves more and more clueless
08:36:46 <renlord> there are people out there who think that if they can read an abstract of a security paper and understand what is being written, they qualify as a security expert
08:36:46 <strcat> pretty much destroying our fragile societies lol
08:36:50 <blacklight447[m]> There is just so much shit out there
08:36:55 <blacklight447[m]> Im surprised the internet even works as it does currently
08:37:12 <strcat> apparently the internet will be what kills human civilization through misinformation
08:37:27 <cyredanthem[m]> I'm a pentester and a cyber security grad who has read every Reddit post strcat has ever made and I don't consider myself more than a novice. My knowledge is shallow
08:38:11 <cyredanthem[m]> I can't imagine what an expert sees
08:38:12 <cyredanthem[m]> I can't stand Reddit
08:38:52 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat "access to more information does "> You can thank search engines for that, giving people "relevent" results

08:41:14 <blacklight447[m]> Purism is the most secure as they "designed their systems, chip by chip, to respect your privacy and security"
08:42:10 <cyredanthem[m]> Firefox is private since we ship ads, have telemetry you can't turn off, we have useless privacy features, and we have terrible security
08:47:08 <blacklight447[m]> Well, one point for firefix: i can configure it to not save anything

08:57:55 <cyredanthem[m]> An Intel is safer than an arm one right? I see a bunch of random companies making the ARM chips and I have no idea how trustworthy they are compared to Intel which at least is pretty good about patching
08:58:13 <cyredanthem[m]> Purely Chromebook hardware I mean
08:58:38 <cyredanthem[m]> I see ARM Chromebooks recommended and I feel like I wouldn't risk it unless it was Qualcomm
08:59:38 <strcat> yandex is the worst search engine btw

09:00:03 <TheJollyRoger> Oh good effing gravy.
09:03:58 <cn3m[m]> <cyredanthem[m] "An Intel is safer than an arm on"> that's a very good question. Hard to access how well a hardware maker audits and patches when they are small
09:07:17 <TheJollyRoger> blacklight447[m]: "firefix" XD.
09:07:19 <TheJollyRoger> That's glorious.
09:07:22 <TheJollyRoger> I love it.
09:07:38 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to use that along with "Fireflops"
09:07:43 <TheJollyRoger> "Firefix!"
09:08:33 <cn3m[m]> Fireflops I do like they
09:08:38 <cn3m[m]> that*
09:08:51 <TheJollyRoger> Hehehehe
09:11:24 <blacklight447[m]> <TheJollyRoger "blacklight447: "firefix" XD."> Finally someone caught it
09:11:40 <cn3m[m]> I miss Firefox
09:12:06 <blacklight447[m]> They can Fix the dumpster Fire of a browser: firefix
09:12:30 <blacklight447[m]> <cn3m[m] "I miss Firefox"> Same
09:12:35 <blacklight447[m]> Improves though
09:12:57 <blacklight447[m]> If they fix their sandboxing on all platforms, and implement tab isolation, it will already be a lot better
09:13:24 <blacklight447[m]> Sadly they are still stuck in 2012, browser security wise
09:18:16 <cn3m[m]> they are stuck older than that
09:18:58 <TheJollyRoger> Ahahaha X3.
09:19:07 <cn3m[m]> They have so much work to do though. over a thousand win32k lockdown rules to add. They need to rework the x server and tighten seccomp rules. They need to get anything remotely like a sandbox on Android
09:19:36 <cn3m[m]> then they need to add security hardening for anti exploit
09:21:11 <cn3m[m]> they probably are a good 10 years off from catching up at this pace
09:25:04 <cn3m[m]> Microsoft is right Firefox should be based on Chromium. They could stick to research
09:26:53 <blacklight447[m]> The thing is though, do we want a single web render engine
09:27:15 <blacklight447[m]> If gecko dies, then all thats really left is safari
09:41:21 <cn3m[m]> gecko is 4% and is slow and broken
09:41:25 <cn3m[m]> it's effectively dead
09:43:16 <blacklight447[m]> Something being small doesnt mean insignificant
09:43:37 <blacklight447[m]> 4% on global scale is stilll tens of millions of people
09:51:58 <renlord> i thought they gave up on firefox
09:52:05 <renlord> and they are focusing their efforts on servo?
09:52:20 <renlord> https://servo.org/

10:04:28 <dallemon[m]> yekip: bitwarden has their own fdroid compatible repo
10:05:17 <yekip[m]> sorry, not sure what that means.
10:05:22 <yekip[m]> where do i go to download bitwarden android app on graphene?
10:05:27 <dallemon[m]> https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile
10:06:09 <dallemon[m]> https://mobileapp.bitwarden.com/fdroid/
10:06:42 <yekip[m]> thanks. never really understood github either but i see it says "get it on fdroid". weird that it didn't come up in search on fdroid app
10:07:01 <dallemon[m]> yekip: do you have fdroid or auroradroid installed?
10:07:28 <yekip[m]> i have fdroid installed
10:08:04 <dallemon[m]> Because it's not in fdroids own repository of apps
10:08:39 <yekip[m]> ok i guess i dont really understand what this repository stuff means, or is.
10:08:40 <yekip[m]> i see that last link thanks
10:08:46 <dallemon[m]> Bitwarden has their own repository that you need to add to fdroid
10:09:07 <yekip[m]> qr codes. never used those either
10:09:08 <yekip[m]> can i do that via fdroid app? do i have  to turn camera on or something?
10:09:45 <yekip[m]> <dallemon[m] "Bitwarden has their own reposito"> so thats like a sub-area of fdroid owned by bitwarden/

10:11:17 <yekip[m]> i can see in FDroid settings, i can add a repo using url and fingerprint. not sure how to do QR. will have to open this page on phone (not on phone here) to copy paste the info. should get it working i think, thanks
10:11:46 <yekip[m]> really must install riot on graphene, that's next!
10:15:17 <yekip[m]> installing. thanks  dallemon
10:15:38 <yekip[m]> (it says my bitwarden repo in fdroid is "unverified". i inserted the fingerprint)
10:19:10 <dallemon[m]> Sync repos. Maybe force close fdroid and open again
10:19:33 <yekip[m]> trying that. thanks

10:24:49 <user48> what github page?
10:26:57 <user48> is it this one? https://github.com/Peter-Easton/GrapheneOS-Knowledge
10:27:32 <yekip[m]> thats the ticket
10:29:27 <user48> I'm looking for help running the flash.bat file (it gives errors each time), where could that be?
10:30:15 <renlord> speak of the devil, google sent me my MTA STS report
10:30:17 <renlord> lol
10:37:01 <nscnt> user48: First thing: I hope you follow https://grapheneos.org/install
10:37:29 <nscnt> user48: If you provide us some more information, we could give you better support for your issue.

10:41:12 <blacklight447[m]> <yekip[m] "Bitwarden for graphene - they on"> I believe they also distribute it via github
10:41:34 <blacklight447[m]> Anyway, you can also download it from the playstore with the aurora app
10:45:27 <user48> oh, figured it out, booted and set it up, now i just gotta figure out how android works (never used it before)
10:46:35 <blacklight447[m]> The first thing you want to do is probbaly install fdroid
10:47:00 <blacklight447[m]> Its an appstore with only foss apps
10:47:25 <nscnt> user48: That's good to hear. Here are a lot of members willing to help if you have questions.
10:47:42 <blacklight447[m]> What apps do you usually use?
10:47:43 <blacklight447[m]> (Do you use stuff like spotify or signal?)
10:50:22 <mxnorvak[m]> Is ungoogled chromium a good option for desktop browsing?
10:50:41 <user48> how does the default browser work?
10:57:36 <nscnt> user48: What exactly? You can use it just like any other browser. If you want more information about it, you could take a look at https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
11:02:51 <user48> yeah that was a dumb question, what should I use for music, I currently use iTunes (not apple music) since I'd never needed to move away, I've wanted to find an alternative that syncs with various platforms
11:11:03 <user48> how much should I research each app before I install it (through f-droid)?  Would the OS warn me if it tried to do anything that could compromise security?
11:11:15 <nscnt> user48: I'm not familiar with iTunes. There are of course music players, but I don't have a recommendation as I'm using Spotify myself. If you want to sync files, I recommend Syncthing. It syncs files directly from device to device.
11:11:57 <user48> yeah I was planning on doing that (syncthing)
11:14:32 <nscnt> user48: Pay attention whether the app your planning to get through F-Droid is maintained and not "Updated 2 years ago" or something. Keep your apps up to date. It's just common sense. If an app doesn't really need permission X, deny it.
11:14:43 <nscnt> *you're planning
11:14:50 <fll[m]> mxnorvak: what would "ungoogled chromium" be?
11:16:22 <fll[m]> You mean ungoogled chrome = chromium?
11:16:43 <nscnt> user48: But no, the OS doesn't warn you if it could do something that would compromise security.
11:18:18 <nscnt> user48: GrapheneOS provides Auditor, though. It checks your device integrity. https://attestation.app/about
11:19:09 <user48> hmm, for example the app 'Noice: Ad-free indefinite background noises' in permissions requests 'view network connections', could that compromise security and would there be a way to prevent in having those permissions and hope it works anyway?
11:19:55 <cx2[m]> Ive made a few Grapheneos handsets, about to make another strictly for CTS. Has anyone been successful with the instructions at grapheneos.org/install on Fedora 32? Going to give it a shot as it’s my distro of choice...just wanted to get any insight from guys that have done in this environment perform
11:21:28 <user48> but the Auditor app is on the play store lol
11:24:13 <fll[m]> cx2: yea, successfully installed graphene with fedora but with downloaded fastboot, not the one from repos. Only adding to $PATH needed, no udev rules necessary
11:25:19 <cx2[m]> Ok.... did you rm android-tools? It’s I’m getting version 20180828*
11:26:17 <user48> recommendations for which android keepass variant is the best?
11:26:37 <nscnt> user48: Auditor is shipped with a GrapheneOS install.
11:26:56 <user48> ahhh...
11:27:43 <cx2[m]> user48: keepassdx is pretty great and probably has the most active development
11:28:34 <nscnt> user48: You're able to deny the Network permission on GrapheneOS, but if the app needs an internet connection to work, it won't run.
11:29:03 <fll[m]> Hmmm...can't remember if I did rm. Might ve been that adding to $PATH just made it use the downloaded version
11:29:45 <fll[m]> Adding requires a relog though iirc
11:30:40 <user48> nscnt: thx
11:31:12 <fll[m]> Also: if I removed I probably did dnf remove instead of RM ;)
11:31:56 <cx2[m]> <fll[m] "Hmmm...can't remember if I did r"> Got it. I’ll see what happens. I remember some time back Linux (don’t remember the distro) was complaining about the repo version
11:34:22 <cx2[m]> <fll[m] "Also: if I removed I probably di"> Haha... got me! I am switching back from a machine running SIlverblue (no dnf), and macOS
11:35:18 <cx2[m]> Well that’s not true.... dnf if inside of a toolbox
11:35:26 <cx2[m]> But you get the idea

11:40:47 <user48> what's the best practices for playing around with android themes?
11:43:03 <fll[m]> mxnorvak: ah thx. Didn't know that was a thing. I'll check that out later
11:49:28 <mxnorvak[m]> Yeah its great that its degoogled and it's based on chromium but idk if the developer applied the necessary patches and security updates that the regular chrome browser gets
11:50:03 <mxnorvak[m]> Was wondering if anyone knows about it or has used it
11:54:13 <user48> can you connect usbs to pixels?
11:54:57 <user48> i saw on a website that it works if the storage type is fat32 which seems weird...
12:00:21 <yekip[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Anyway, you can also download it"> thanks BL. heard of aurora but not tried it yet.
12:04:12 <yekip[m]> <user48 "yeah that was a dumb question, w"> have you heard of quod libret? not sure if they have a version for android but i am about to find out as I am looking for a non apple player for mac OS. I use Vinyl player on graphene. also SimpleCamera, Open Camera, and Simple Gallery is nice. Transistor - I use for internet radio, lovely simple app turns phone into radio which works in standy  nicely.Signal, Omni Notes,
12:04:12 <yekip[m]> DuckDuckGo browser, Scrambled Exif. Thats about all the apps I have right now, in case any are useful to look at. All are good for privacy (according to my own research, always do your own though!)
12:05:19 <fll[m]> If you're looking for NTFS support, that might have prohibitive licensing. At least most Linux distros don't offer it via their main repos...
12:05:30 <yekip[m]> <user48 "can you connect usbs to pixels?"> afaik you can, but I haven't tried yet myself. I could be wrong, but I think someone told me you can. I think JollyRoger said you can take a backup to USB Stick that way. I _think_
12:13:50 <fll[m]> A very quick (unthorough) search suggests that NTFS is not available on Android. Would require root + installation of support. I guess besides fat32 ext4 should work too?
12:28:49 <brenneke[m]> Can anyone please suggest a good office suite app that works with GrapheneOS? Still struggling with finding something suitable, was using WPS but seems it is unhappy when too many permissions restricted.
12:34:33 <yekip[m]> I would have to suggest a desktop computer :D
12:34:58 <yekip[m]> sorry! email on my phone is modern enough for me, can't imagine trying to write a spreadsheet!

12:36:06 <yekip[m]> i wanted to give Eddie (AirVPN) a go on graphene. https://airvpn.org/android/ - Their app is pretty good I think (security wise). Is there any advantage to choosing app over openVPN, or vice versa?
12:47:15 <brenneke[m]> <yekip[m] " * sorry! email on my phone is m"> Agree but nice to at least have an app that will read and edit a docx for example when away from desktop.
12:48:04 <bseeinu[m]> Mullvad much more stable than Eddie
12:48:11 <bseeinu[m]> On graphene
12:57:15 <yekip[m]> Thanks, I don't want Mullvad, PIA was excellent in t erms of app performance, widget too and way faster connections. I got Eddie installed and it's horrible. Constant alerts. No idea what encryption algorithm to use either. But worst of all, speed test gives me 0.5mbps. Not sure what's wrong, could be bad signal although I ws getting 5-10mbps without VPN turned on. And Air servers are very fast usually. weird. i may dump
12:57:15 <yekip[m]> it and go back to PIA
12:58:49 <bseeinu[m]> :) OK, curious why no mullvad
13:00:26 <yekip[m]> mainly price. i am very confident in it's performance and privacy etc. just price really
13:00:50 <yekip[m]> i already have 3 subs to VPNs, dont need another one especially at a fiver a month. times are hard ya know :D
13:01:16 <yekip[m]> big respect for mullvad all the same
13:02:54 <lvkm[m]> user48: you can connect an usb stick with the otg adapter (one comes in the box). exfat is also supported if you need it for files bigger than 4gb.
13:02:54 <lvkm[m]> if you want some cunstomisation get xscreensaver from fdroid for some tweakable live wallpapers. uses surprisingly little battery.

13:08:17 <yekip[m]> I notice PIA (and others) have a builit in kill switch.  I always use that, but is there any point as I see Graphene settings offer the options in there, always on and block traffic outside VPN. I have both turned on, so shall i bother with the VPN app's own kill switch or is that 'over kill'. tee hee
13:40:29 <yekip[m]> Does anyone have a view on allowing BitWarden to have access to autofill password fields?
14:03:15 <flabbergasted> It's a matter of trust. Do you trust Bitwarden? I do.
14:16:25 <bseeinu[m]> I do have it on too
14:45:18 <dazinism> user48: have a look at https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
14:47:13 <dazinism> bseeinu: Collabora office is the only functional on device office suite I've found. Its a split apk so had to mess about a bit to install
14:47:30 <dazinism> Possibly Aurora store handles split apks now?
14:48:39 <dazinism> Using nextcloud via web browser with only office used to work on mobile, but they recently broke it!
14:50:29 <dazinism> I used https://f-droid.org/app/com.aefyr.sai.fdroid to install the split apk
14:51:27 <dazinism> cryptopad.fr stuff kinda works ok on device.
14:53:03 <dazinism> *on mobile devices
14:53:58 <dazinism> I've never tried any commercial/proprietary office suites on mobile
14:54:40 <dazinism> Actually scratch commercial, blatantly all the things I just mentioned are....
14:56:10 <cx2[m]> fll: did you have permissions problems on fedora? I can see the handset, but “no permissions”
14:57:31 <dazinism> cx2: have you set up the path?
14:57:41 <fll[m]> cx2: hmm...can't remember tbh. You did try sudo I guess?
14:57:42 <cx2[m]> Yes
14:58:43 <dazinism> adb? Given permission on device?
14:59:43 <cx2[m]> dazinism: path set for platform tools adb devices lists the hand self, with “no permissions”
15:00:06 <cx2[m]> Nvm... FINALLY it decided to pop up on the handset
15:00:28 <fll[m]> fastboot --version shows the new one now?
15:00:37 <fll[m]> Ah ok
15:04:15 <yekip[m]> <flabbergasted "It's a matter of trust. Do you t"> thanks
15:05:04 <cx2[m]> So that was a lie...
15:05:44 <cx2[m]> $PATH is correct... fastboot version is also correct. Still getting “no permissions”
15:18:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <yekip[m] "ok i guess i dont really underst"> You should probably learn these! Sent you an invite to that room because there's a lot of questions being asked in there similar to yours (some of which are mildly OT for this room =] )
15:30:50 <yekip[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "You should probably learn these!"> OT?
15:30:56 <yekip[m]> Ah, I had a load of spam invites so i rejected all quickly but thought i saw a username i recognised! feel free to send again, in fact please do :)
15:42:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> yekip: Sent!
15:53:24 <yekip[m]> thanks. will accept and jump in later, just off out here.
15:54:59 <cx2[m]> fll: so it seems there are two versions of fastboot installed. Will sees my device just fine, but I believe it’s out of date. The other is definitely updated to 30.XX, with it in my $PATH it still says “no permission”
16:00:54 <dazinism> I'd try and get rid of the old one
16:01:56 <mxnorvak[m]> Why doesn't Google just announce pixel 4a, leaks used to be blurry pics, now it seem like every other day there is a whole new 10 min video showing a feature of pixel 4a in depth
16:02:38 <dazinism> cx2: guess worth trying different leads / usb ports alsp
16:04:27 <cx2[m]> dazinism: did that, current version still doesn’t have permission
16:05:23 <cx2[m]> Platform-tools is living in /home/....$PATH is set.... still, no permissions
16:06:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Here we fuckin go again, with the discrediting Graphene.

16:06:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Techlore, mods no less.
16:07:36 <cx2[m]> That’s because techlore is a bitch
16:07:58 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: what are they doing
16:08:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Fuckin cocksuckers are insufferable.
16:08:28 <strcat> I thought that community supported the project?
16:08:31 <cx2[m]> He’s called up out a while back when the channel was trashing grapheneos, he said “I supportED the device, not the developer...blah blah crybaby shit”
16:08:59 <strcat> I don't understand
16:10:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> He needs to reign in his mods before he loses mindshare in that room.
16:10:44 <strcat> what exactly is happening? why are people attacking myself and the project there?
16:10:46 <strcat> don't understand
16:10:51 <strcat> never had any conflict with them afaik
16:10:56 <cx2[m]> <strcat "I thought that community support"> Thought so too until techlore actual chimed in and was whining because apparently he asked you about the video he made re: GrapheneOS install / review. And he didn’t receive the response he wanted.
16:11:38 <cx2[m]> Like I said, on the topic of GrapheneOS, techlore himself has whined about it. I’m sure he encourages his mods to do the same.
16:12:06 <strcat> I don't understand
16:12:13 <strcat> never did anything to them
16:13:29 <strcat> James apparently contacted him
16:13:33 <strcat> wonder if that has anything to do with it

16:14:21 <cx2[m]> Techlore stated that he asked you if there was a certain way you wanted the video done, or anything that you wanted added. He said he didn’t receive a good response. Also stated that he believes that the project management is toxic
16:14:53 <strcat> I didn't want people relying on a video that is frozen in time
16:15:09 <strcat> and you see the results of people relying on some old fastboot version on Windows
16:15:23 <strcat> I need to merge the changes to flash-all.bat but they weren't submitted as a pull request
16:15:28 <strcat> so I lost track of that
16:15:33 <strcat> maybe JTL knows?
16:15:41 <strcat> I think it was JTL  and someone else working on it?
16:15:43 <strcat> can't remember
16:17:34 <flabbergasted> @strcat This might be a stupid question, and completely unrelated to GOS, but when I plug in the charger, it takes a couple of seconds before it starts to charge, and then it vibrabes another time a little later indicating charging is in process.

16:18:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> strcat: I linked you to the discussion above. And will be posting more screenshots here.
16:18:16 <cx2[m]> Well regarding a video, I dont’ disagree to a point. As long as it explicitly states that “this video is current as of today, this will likely not work with future releases, etc.”
16:18:16 <cx2[m]> Where I take issue is just with him being annoying and whining
16:19:02 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: I'd guess James is involved in this
16:19:02 <DannyWorkOrderPr> But they're already retracting messages due to being called onto the carpet.
16:19:03 <flabbergasted> I left Techlore after 10 seconds after I joined it. It's a bunch of bull.
16:19:25 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: techlore said at one point James contacted him and this is what James likes to do
16:19:57 <strcat> and it's such BS to say I don't accept help from others - I just didn't want to have that kind of installation video

16:20:34 <strcat> and I have not had the time / energy to do interviews or things like that largely due to what James is doing
16:20:44 <limitless0[m]> He removed the post i think
16:21:20 <strcat> it's not at all true that I "don't accept help"
16:21:23 <strcat> doesn't make any sense
16:21:29 <strcat> why are these people spreading BS and attacking me
16:21:32 <strcat> never did anything to them
16:21:47 <flabbergasted> Should just remove the matrix channel and stick to irc. Since Techlore is pretty high up in suggestions in matrix in that category.

16:26:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat "never did anything to them"> It's not about you, Daniel. It usually never is. It's about control over a topic - how people should protect themselves in tech. And the "nice, privacy" crowd don't like when actual security enters the ring and boxes their ears.
16:26:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Surely my messages will eventually go through, ( Matrix.org homeserver sucks today), but, strcat, It's not about you, Daniel. It usually never is. It's about control over a topic - how people should protect themselves in tech. And the "nice, privacy" crowd don't like when actual security enters the ring and boxes their ears.
16:27:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <flabbergasted "Should just remove the matrix ch"> That's exactly why the Matrix channel *shouldn't* be removed!
16:27:49 <strcat[m]> no plans to remove the Matrix channel
16:27:49 <strcat[m]> but it is really slow
16:27:53 <strcat[m]> and unreliable
16:27:58 <joshman[m]> Do you guys know any advantages on using LTE Mode only?
16:28:16 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#lte-only-mode
16:28:29 <limitless0[m]> Is it better to use irc on mobile? I have never used irc before
16:28:32 <limitless0[m]> For this channel
16:28:56 <flabbergasted> Unless your carrier supports VoLTE you should not use LTE only.
16:28:57 <joshman[m]> * Do you guys know any advantages on using LTE Mode only? Like maybe better battery life or maybe some security advantages?
16:29:19 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "and unreliable"> Matrix.org is unreliable. Wonder how bad the hit to the userbase would be if this room moved to another homeserver.
16:29:52 <joshman[m]> <flabbergasted "Unless your carrier supports VoL"> My carrier does not support. Why shouldn't I use it?
16:30:27 <flabbergasted> If you rely on regular calls and texts you shouldn't use it.
16:31:47 <joshman[m]> Regular calls and texts are far in the 90s for me
16:32:07 <flabbergasted> For you maybe, but not for the gen pop.
16:32:25 <strcat[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: well does it have to move
16:32:37 <strcat[m]> or could there just be a new room that would see the other matrix users via irc bridge?
16:32:58 <strcat[m]> if there was another server bridged to it would the matrix users here just see them as irc users
16:33:02 <strcat[m]> which seems fine
16:33:27 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yeah, I mean, if you just made a new room with a tchncs.de matrix account, it'd be on that homeserver, for example
16:33:27 <strcat[m]> this bridge system is also annoying because I don't fully control this room, the irc service does
16:33:49 <strcat[m]> really annoying
16:33:53 <strcat[m]> and it kicks 'inactive' users
16:33:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> tchncs.de (for example)**
16:33:58 <strcat[m]> which sucks
16:34:16 <strcat[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: I don't understand why that techlore community is being nasty
16:34:26 <strcat[m]> also GrapheneOS does a lot of work on privacy not just security enhancements
16:34:37 <strcat[m]> the privacy also depends on the security
16:34:56 <strcat[m]> so security enhancements reinforce privacy
16:35:09 <strcat[m]> but we do a lot of work on privacy improvements
16:35:12 <benpa[m]> FYI rooms are not tied to a particular homeserver
16:35:38 <benpa[m]> this room is already "on" matrix.org and tchncs.de
16:35:40 <strcat[m]> and have landed a lot of stuff upstream in that area
16:35:51 <strcat[m]> benpa: but this one is tied to the irc service
16:35:52 <benpa[m]> federation means that the content of this room is seen by both servers
16:35:56 <strcat[m]> benpa: the irc service thing owns it not me
16:36:15 <strcat[m]> and the main lag issue is with the irc service thing I think
16:36:30 <strcat[m]> I also don't like how aggressively it kicks people
16:36:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "the privacy also depends on the "> We've told them 200 times. They're willfully ignorant.
16:36:43 <strcat[m]> it kicked people that were pretty core community members and just inactive for a few months
16:38:20 <strcat[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: do they understand we do a lot of work on privacy and work to fill in gaps from not having Play Services
16:38:23 <DannyWorkOrderPr> benpa: So what's the fix, ask everyone to move their accounts to another Homeserver?
16:38:53 <strcat[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: sandbox improvements restricting what apps can do, permission system improvements (features like Network and Sensors permissions), MAC randomization improvements, all kinds of other things
16:39:00 <strcat[m]> tons of stuff we've landed upstream
16:39:00 <benpa[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "benpa: So what's the fix, ask ev"> that's one benefit of Matrix - messages are shared (per room between servers)
16:39:12 <benpa[m]> it sounds like the big problem you're having is that the Freenode bridge is laggy
16:39:18 <strcat[m]> benpa: I think the main issue is the irc service thing since I don't actually own this room
16:39:45 <strcat[m]> benpa: since matrix.org server has rooms for irc channels we used the existing room thinking it was the best approach to avoid people split across multiple rooms bridged to the same irc channel
16:39:48 <DannyWorkOrderPr> benpa At this stage, the lack of performance of Matrix.org is a detriment to the mindshare of Matrix, as evidenced by this community.
16:39:51 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "Danny@WorkOrderPro: I don't unde"> strcat, It's not about you, Daniel. It usually never is. It's about control over a topic - how people should protect themselves in tech. And the "nice, privacy" crowd (Techlore mods, Mozilla, etc) don't like when actual security enters the ring and boxes their ears.
16:39:56 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure it was the best approach since this way we're stuck with the irc service
16:40:11 <benpa[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "benpa At this stage, the lack of"> we are aware of that
16:40:15 <strcat[m]> can't replace it with another and it won't give me full control of this room
16:40:20 <strcat[m]> even though I own the irc channel
16:40:23 <strcat[m]> ideally I could get admin in this room
16:40:35 <benpa[m]> ok, let's see if we can solve that wrt adminship
16:40:58 <strcat[m]> I have founder access for the irc channel although I don't think freenode will actually give you an 'sop' status in the channel
16:41:00 <strcat[m]> it just works via chanserv
16:41:11 <strcat[m]> I think think &user exists on freenode or oftc
16:41:12 <benpa[m]> I hadn't realised you were having these problems - just happened to look in here by chance...
16:41:48 <strcat[m]> lol I'm always having problems with everything
16:41:50 <strcat[m]> I am used to it
16:41:51 <strcat[m]> not specific to matrix
16:42:16 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <benpa[m] "I hadn't realised you were havin"> We'd really appreciate any insight you can give from the Matrix side, this community needs to continue to spread its wings!!

16:43:55 <benpa[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "We'd really appreciate any insig"> basically bridging Matrix and Freenode is an ongoing, endless struggle

16:44:07 <benpa[m]> ^ gives a little context
16:44:52 <strcat[m]> benpa: so basically it'd be nice if there was some way to show the bot I own the channel and get owner privs
16:45:07 <benpa[m]> yeah I'm working on that now
16:45:15 <strcat[m]> the way it does privs is a little bit weird since if it ever sees you get +o it gives you persistent +o here
16:45:20 <strcat[m]> mod, w/e
16:45:40 <strcat[m]> so the way I gave myself privs is I did +o on my matrix username in the channel
16:46:09 <strcat[m]> but I could register my matrix username and identify as it
16:46:42 <strcat[m]> you can group nicknames on freenode so it'd have founder status
16:46:48 <strcat[m]> so if the bot could check with NickServ that would probably be enough
16:46:57 <strcat[m]> and maybe that's also a better way to handle giving mod status really
16:47:04 <strcat[m]> NickServ/ChanServ
16:47:14 <strcat[m]> vs just seeing who has +o atm
16:47:23 <bseeinu[m]> <strcat[m] "bseeinu: try turning it off inst"> Same thing. Framerate drops to crazy low when opening any camera apps. Only 1 of 2 selfie cams works, only with open camera

17:27:10 <cx2[m]> Yes. “Older fastboot” in that I was able to list my device without issue.
17:27:10 <cx2[m]> Installed platform tools with fastboot 30.XX and now I am getting “no permissions”
17:27:39 <cx2[m]> I am also not being prompted by the handset to “trust this device” either.
17:28:59 <fll[m]> Maybe wrong chmod on the the platform tools?
17:30:53 <cx2[m]> Already `chmod -R 755 platform-tools1
17:36:30 <cx2[m]> * Already `chmod -R 755 platform-tools`
17:37:45 <cx2[m]> Again, worked fine with the older fastboot.... but i didnt’ want to continue with the older version since i figured it would cause issues down the road
17:40:50 <strcat[m]> remove it
17:41:08 <strcat[m]> start over
17:41:16 <strcat[m]> don't chmod or change anything
17:41:20 <strcat[m]> follow instructions to the letter
18:01:38 <cx2[m]> Fastboot version prints correctly with the up-to-date version.
18:01:38 <cx2[m]> This tells me that my $PATH is correct
18:01:38 <cx2[m]> When querying the device `adb devices` it prints `xxxmydevice.           no permissions;...`
18:02:03 <strcat> did you remove it and start over
18:05:02 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: did you try invoking fastboot with sudo?  It would point you in the correct direction to figure out the problem.
18:05:35 <cx2[m]> Yes. I have started over a few times now.
18:05:36 <cx2[m]> Of note, I am on fedora, with android-tools, I was able to successfully query the handset. But did not proceed further due to the instructions stating that it’s out of date and broken on Ubuntu and Debian (Fedora wasn’t covered, but given that the android-tools version was from 2018, I figured it applied here as well. ) Therefore I removed android-tools, and instead opted for platform-tools.
18:05:36 <cx2[m]> But, as noted, adb in platform tools prints “no permissions”
18:05:40 <BrokenCog> also, what is output of 'which fastboot'
18:06:41 <cx2[m]> `~/platform-tools/fastboot`
18:06:44 <BrokenCog> $ fastboot devices
18:06:45 <BrokenCog> no permissions  fastboot
18:06:49 <BrokenCog> is that the error?
18:07:13 <BrokenCog> and, did you try 'sudo fastboot' ?
18:07:14 <cx2[m]> That’s the printout of “which fastboot”
18:07:38 <BrokenCog> yes, I understood that.  Is the message from "fastboot devices" looking like:
18:07:40 <cx2[m]> Command not found when “sudo fastboot”
18:07:41 <BrokenCog> no permissions  fastboot
18:07:50 <nickcalyx[m]> BrokenCog:
18:08:00 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: yeah, you need to 'sudo $(which fastboot)' ...
18:08:08 <BrokenCog> because your PATh isn't in root's
18:09:48 <cx2[m]> I think that’s definitely my issue, so the question would be how to correctly set my path. I copy and pasted from the documentation, which at least gets me into platform tools
18:10:11 <BrokenCog> it's not a path issue.  did you run the command as sudo?  and what was hte result?
18:10:37 <strcat> btw you shouldn't generally use the `which` command
18:11:28 <cx2[m]> $(which fastboot) prints `fastboot: usage: no command`
18:11:54 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: yes, you need to put the options after it ... 'sudo $(which fastboot) devices' for intsance
18:12:03 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: yes, you need to put the options after it ... 'sudo $(which fastboot) -l devices' for intsance
18:12:54 <BrokenCog> strcat: he needs which here because root doesn't have his user's ~/android-tools stored in roots $PATH.  once he figures out the permissions issue, he won't need sudo, and thus won't need to use which.
18:13:11 <strcat> yeah but you shouldn't use which
18:13:16 <strcat> it's an obsolete / bad command
18:13:30 <cx2[m]> Learning is occurring... haha
18:13:30 <cx2[m]> Ok... does not print anything.
18:13:50 <strcat> BrokenCog: which doesn't match how the shell looks up commands
18:13:52 <BrokenCog> but the device is connected?  and, developer options USB Debugging is enabled?
18:14:04 <cx2[m]> Yes.
18:14:05 <BrokenCog> strcat: it's close enough in this case.
18:14:23 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: does 'adb devices' show the device?
18:15:26 <cx2[m]> `adb devices` proves this.
18:15:26 <cx2[m]> The problem is, it also prints `mydevice           No permissions;`
18:15:50 <strcat> fastboot is not adb
18:15:54 <strcat> the install instructions don't use adb
18:16:01 <strcat> fastboot does not connect to a device booted into the OS
18:16:20 <strcat> you're making things way more complicated than they need to be by doing stuff not in the instructions
18:18:42 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: is your device at the bootloader screen?
18:22:52 <madaidan[m]> There's `type` instead of `which`
18:23:09 <cx2[m]> Ok...swapped cables and ports.
18:23:09 <cx2[m]> Sudo `$(which fastboot) -l devices` prints `myxxdevicexx.   Fastboot usb:1-3`
18:23:30 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: and as non-root user?
18:23:49 <cx2[m]> `no permissions`
18:24:13 <cx2[m]> I’m sorry.... `fastboot devices` prints `no permissions`
18:24:55 <cx2[m]> And yes I’m at the boot loader screen
18:24:57 <cx2[m]> I don’t think i answered that before
18:24:58 <BrokenCog> as non-root.  I suspect it's a udev issue, try this fix:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27017453/fastboot-and-adb-not-working-with-sudo
18:25:23 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: when you talked about fastboot, it was probably assumed.
18:26:02 <strcat> cx2[m]: your distro is making things way more complicated than they need to be, just do it again from the start as root
18:26:18 <BrokenCog> or fix udev permissions.
18:26:27 <strcat> you don't gain anything not doing it as root when you are freely transitioning to root with sudo anyway
18:26:32 <strcat> might as well just be doing it as root
18:26:38 <strcat> no advantage to overcomplicating it
18:26:40 <strcat> not security
18:26:45 <cx2[m]> <BrokenCog "cx2: when you talked about fastb"> Ok, i just wanted to make sure I was answering you correctly
18:26:48 <BrokenCog> if he fixes the udev permissions, he won't be doing it as root.
18:26:57 <strcat> don't overcomplicate it
18:27:02 <strcat> this could all be done in 5 minutes
18:27:06 <strcat> instead of making it way harder than it has to be
18:27:15 <strcat> the instructions don't use adb, only fastboot
18:27:28 <strcat> if you're on a distribution that does not permit accessing usb devices as non-root just do it as root
18:27:32 <strcat> start over again and do it as root
18:27:41 <strcat> don't make things overcomplicated, this process takes 5 mins
18:27:59 <strcat> start at https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot and do it as root
18:28:07 <cx2[m]> strcat: macOS was a breeze.... I am ok with the distro “making it difficult” Again. This device is purely going to be used purely for CTS. So if that means I can ALSO hang a note about “Fedora being difficult, and here’s the workaround” then I want to do that as well
18:28:40 <BrokenCog> cx2[m]: try that udev perm's adjustment in the link, it should then work as a non-root user.
18:28:41 <strcat> cx2[m]: the problem is udev doesn't include rules for lots of things by default
18:28:57 <strcat> you aren't allowed to access random kinds of devices as non-root on a traditional linux distro
18:29:01 <strcat> even though it doesn't make much sense
18:30:06 <BrokenCog> that's the nature of udev/usb/world-full-of-manufacturers miking with various security intrepretations.
18:30:31 <strcat> if you EVER run sudo from your user account
18:30:39 <strcat> or enter your password ever
18:30:48 <strcat> and have sudo enabled with unrestricted use
18:30:52 <strcat> your account is equivalent to root
18:31:39 <madaidan[m]> Yeah, someone can trivially intercept/keylog the password.
18:32:13 <strcat> or make your commands do something else
18:32:15 <strcat> when you enter them
18:32:29 <strcat> if you use sudo to run things as root then your account is basically root
18:32:33 <strcat> what's the distinction?
18:32:54 <strcat> and I'm sure all the important data is in your user account
18:33:01 <strcat> it is not a security model that makes any sense
18:33:29 <cx2[m]> Ok. The goal here isn’t to ultimately add to my collection of devices. The goal is to troubleshoot, correctly, “installing GrapheneOS for Fedora users”
18:34:12 <cx2[m]> Since it’s not in the documentation, I can hopefully add it to the unofficial
18:34:39 <strcat> run
18:34:40 <strcat> sudo -i
18:34:47 <strcat> do the entire process from https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
18:34:54 <BrokenCog> did the udev perms work? you'll probably need to reboot for them to take affect.
18:35:19 <cx2[m]> So what is the ROOT problem then? What I’m trying to get to the bottom of, is why Fastboot will not run on fedora without root
18:35:19 <BrokenCog> restarting udev is fraught with Usually and Frequently leading to Doesn't.
18:35:37 <strcat> cx2[m]: because linux distros don't let you access usb devices without root
18:35:38 <BrokenCog> it doesn't need root, it needs udev to have non-root permissions to the USB device.
18:35:41 <BrokenCog> read that link.
18:35:53 * madaidan[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/noHvIrDbqcvTUSmMBcssMhSZ >
18:35:53 <strcat> cx2[m]: they have special cases for certain kinds of things like usb flash drives
18:36:02 <strcat> cx2[m]: they don't include a standard special case for things they don't know about
18:36:07 <BrokenCog> Google's AOSP has a udev rule to add for their devices to solve this.
18:36:09 <strcat> so if you plug in a serial debug cable or anything else
18:36:10 <madaidan[m]> It's incredibly easy
18:36:13 <strcat> it's totally useless
18:36:15 <strcat> without root
18:36:20 <flabbergasted> Yeah Leaseweb can't be compared to Novoserve in my experience.
18:36:25 <flabbergasted> wrong channel
18:36:26 <strcat> so just use root and don't bother setting up udev rules
18:36:31 <strcat> far more likely you screw up stuff with udev rules
18:36:31 <cx2[m]> strcat: but I can access it just fine with android-tools. It’s platform-tools that are causing issues
18:36:33 <BrokenCog> LOL.
18:36:43 <strcat> cx2[m]: don't know what you mean by that
18:37:04 <strcat> what is 'android-tools'
18:37:33 <strcat> guessing some messed up fedora package with nonsense like setuid / setgid binaries]
18:38:19 <strcat> anyway just do it as root that's what your distribution needs
18:38:28 <strcat> fussing around with udev rules is pointless
18:38:42 <strcat> if you do stuff via sudo from your user account, it is basically the root account anyway
18:38:53 <cx2[m]> <strcat "cx2: don't know what you mean by"> When downloading android-tools (which is old so I `dnf remove` it) it initially worked without root. Again, i realized it was old, and accoriding to the instructions, went with downloading platform-tools..... which is not working
18:38:53 <strcat> just run `sudo -i` and do everything in that shell instead
18:39:05 <strcat> cx2[m]: I don't know what android-tools is
18:39:16 <strcat> cx2[m]: that's not an AOSP / Android thing
18:39:24 <strcat> that's some non-standard fedora thing
18:39:33 <strcat> cx2[m]: perhaps android-tools includes udev rules for fastboot with some devices
18:39:34 <cx2[m]> What is android tools?? It’s in your documentation
18:39:34 <cx2[m]> “Arch Linux: android-tools provides fastboot...”
18:39:41 <strcat> cx2[m]: that's an arch linux package
18:39:56 <strcat> a fedora package called android-tools is not the same thing
18:40:05 <strcat> android-tools is an arch linux package made by the maintainer of the package
18:40:15 <strcat> he wrote a new build system for fastboot, adb, etc. and packages it his way
18:40:21 <strcat> includes a random assortment of tools he chose
18:40:27 <strcat> that is arch linux specific
18:40:34 <cx2[m]> well that’s where I made the mistake. Either way, I removed it.... even though fastboot was working just fine.
18:40:38 <strcat> it is an arch linux project not an AOSP / Android project
18:41:14 <strcat> the whole thing seems based on a misunderstanding of AOSP
18:41:18 <strcat> by these distros
18:41:35 <strcat> they don't understand the versioning system of platform-tools (fastboot, adb, etc.) somehow and invented their own
18:41:42 <strcat> they don't understand how to sync the sources
18:41:47 <strcat> they don't know how to use the build system
18:42:03 <strcat> and they made their own downstream packages with their own versioning schemes, etc.
18:42:11 <strcat> so for example
18:42:13 <strcat> https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/generate_build.rb?h=packages/android-tools
18:42:19 <strcat> # Android has a huge and monolithic build system that does not allow to build
18:42:21 <strcat> # components separately.
18:42:28 <strcat> but you can run `m adb fastboot` to build just those...
18:42:48 <strcat> and there are build targets for the SDK repository packages like platform-tools
18:42:52 <strcat> so you can build platform-tools as a whole
18:42:59 <strcat> and have a zip produced with the standard platform-tools
18:45:25 <strcat> cx2[m]: anyway you don't have udev rules for this kind of device so you need to do stuff as root
18:45:41 <strcat> cx2[m]: you're overcomplicating it by doing some stuff as non-root and some as root, etc.
18:45:55 <strcat> cx2[m]: either obtain set up proper udev rules or use root
18:46:31 <strcat> and listen to my warning that fussing around with udev rules is not actually accomplishing anything and is overcomplicating it
18:46:41 <strcat> gives you another thing that could go wrong and you need to maintain that
18:46:59 <strcat> get your distro to provide less bad packages
18:47:21 <cx2[m]> So with `sudo -i` —-> `fastboot —version` prints `bash: fastboot: command not found...`
18:47:21 <cx2[m]> Then `Install package ‘android-tools’ to provide command ‘fastboot’`
18:47:26 <strcat> what arch linux does is still super messed up just far less than fedora, debian, etc. which all have differently fucked up stuff
18:47:47 <strcat> cx2[m]: I said you need to start from https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
18:47:56 <strcat> sudo -i gives you a root shell
18:48:03 <strcat> you are starting over as root
18:48:24 <strcat> cx2[m]: you have a lot of different options but you're choosing to stay stuck overcomplicating things
18:48:30 <strcat> self-inflicted issues
18:49:13 <strcat> either do everything as root or do what is required to make it work as non-root
18:49:37 <strcat> otherwise you will encounter the issues you have encountered mixing a non-root environment with a DIFFERENT root environment
18:50:02 <strcat> you can't set up fastboot for one user and then run it in a different user's environment
18:51:47 <strcat> linux distros overcomplicate this
18:52:02 <strcat> it would be really easy to not use the CLI at all if they just had proper packages
18:52:17 <strcat> could ship an unlock and lock script
18:52:28 <strcat> double click unlock, double click flash-all, double click lock
18:52:41 <strcat> but no they decide to make everything super fucked up / complicated
18:53:35 <strcat> I could just tell people the only supported OSes are Windows, macOS and Arch Linux and explicitly check for and reject other distros until they fix their packages
18:53:36 <cx2[m]> strcat: heres the deal... You’re original comment, was “follow the instructions to the letter”
18:53:36 <cx2[m]> No where in those instructions does it say anything about `sudo -I` etc. In fact, following those instructions *does not* work on Fedora apparently.
18:53:36 <cx2[m]> Things like “self-inflicted issues” are not useful. Especially when I have stated multiple times that I am creating this handset PURELY to help out however i can. If that means it’s only CTS then so be it. If that **ALSO** means I can help provide a workaround to getting GrapheneOS up and running on Fedora, then even better.
18:53:49 <strcat> cx2[m]: your distro doesn't have a working non-root user
18:53:54 <strcat> use root for everything
18:54:27 <strcat> or spend your time working around / fixing the distro including setting up custom udev rules
18:54:36 <strcat> which is a super messed up thing to need
18:54:43 <strcat> the way this works is just broken
18:55:06 <strcat> List of distribution packages:
18:55:08 <strcat> Arch Linux: android-tools provides fastboot and other useful tools not required for installation such as adb. android-udev provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root.
18:55:14 <strcat> cx2[m]: the answer to your problems is there
18:55:44 <strcat> and don't ask me why extra udev rules are required - I can't justify how fucked up it is
18:56:07 <strcat> that udev rules are required to use a hardware bitcoin wallet, serial debug cable and all kinds of other devices not fitting existing rules
18:56:10 <strcat> it doesn't make any sense
18:57:35 <cx2[m]> <strcat "cx2: the answer to your problems"> You’re still getting this wrong. This is not “my” answer. I already have a grip of phones that I can’t use. This answer is for the community. For people that are, in this case, on Fedora.
18:57:56 <cx2[m]> * > <@freenode_strcat:matrix.org> cx2: the answer to your problems is there
18:57:56 <cx2[m]> You’re still getting this wrong. This is not “my” answer. I already have a grip of phones that I don’t use running GrapheneOS. This answer is for the community. For people that are, in this case, on Fedora.
18:57:56 <cx2[m]> I am fortunate in that I have the means to procure multiple machines and handsets to support in this way, since I am clearly not a programmer.
18:58:41 <strcat> report a bug to your distribution about their broken packaging and OS
18:58:45 <strcat> multiple bugs
18:58:57 <strcat> 1) they should allow local users to use USB devices without special rules or packages
18:59:29 <strcat> 2) they shouldn't have totally broken android SDK packages, if they aren't going to properly build / package things they shouldn't have packages for them
18:59:49 <strcat> they should use the upstream versioning and upstream build system
18:59:52 <strcat> and stop making broken crap
19:00:10 <strcat> or call it fedora-android-tools to make it clear it isn't some upstream / AOSP / Android thing it's their own fork
19:01:28 <strcat> if people pulled that shit with my project I would be telling them they have to stop naming it after my project based on trademark law like firefox did with debian for a long time
19:01:36 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "and stop making broken crap"> I don't think that's possible. Linux distros *are* broken crap.
19:01:58 <strcat> what justification do they have to write their own broken build system for this
19:02:13 <strcat> they don't understand the software or what they're doing
19:02:34 <strcat> and why is root needed to access USB devices unless you make a bunch of custom udev rules for each type of USB device other than basic things like flash drives
19:02:36 <cn3m[m]> no real alternative sadly @madaidan.:matrix.org
19:02:37 <strcat> why is it so fucked
19:03:02 <strcat> my answer is just do everything as root since your user account is already effective root anyway
19:03:47 <strcat> what difference would it make if you just logged in as root compared to a user account with full root access
19:03:53 <strcat> it's just like UAC on windows but worse
19:04:09 <strcat> UAC is less bad than this kind of sudo use
19:04:47 <strcat> I wonder if the windows subsystem for linux thing has working usb devices
19:05:39 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "no real alternative sadly @madai"> TempleOS
19:06:15 <cn3m[m]> wsl2 should iirc
19:06:26 <strcat> but wsl2 is just a vm
19:06:30 <strcat> so it has all the problems of the distro

19:29:41 <strcat> spreading misinformation, giving people gifts, flattering them
19:29:43 <cn3m[m]> Ah I'll check that out thanks
19:29:45 <madaidan[m]> Samourai bans anyone debunking that shit :(
19:29:58 <strcat> cn3m[m]: they have 2 telegram channels where he's very active spreading misinformation
19:30:19 <strcat> and the people in that community are supporting him and helping him harm GrapheneOS and myself
19:30:26 <strcat> and actively participating
19:30:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat would you like if I try to implement streaming OTAs in the updater?
19:31:05 <cn3m[m]> thanks strcat
19:31:05 <strcat> cn3m[m]: and then there is this techlore community which originally seemed to support the project, but he got upset and now apparently they are doing spiteful things like spreading misinformation
19:31:09 <strcat> don't quite understand what happened with that
19:31:23 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: also need a script to generate the update packages for them
19:31:27 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: you can try working on it
19:31:52 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: I have initial support for it already - it downloads the entire existing update zip (including payload) and then does a streaming update
19:31:55 <strcat> so it downloads payload 2x
19:32:06 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: so what it needs is a separate slim update package without the payload.bin included
19:32:11 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: also haven't tested it for a long time
19:32:20 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: cdesai ran into some problems with CAs with it
19:32:23 <strcat> didn't work with Let's Encrypt
19:32:26 <strcat> don't know what that was about
19:32:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> They can switch sides in the blink of an eye where the cash is
19:33:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW I have some code and a metadata generator
19:33:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Though it's not the best code I can send some of it to you privately
19:33:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Techlore is just a YouTuber
19:33:36 <strcat> maybe issue is it doesn't trust cross-signed CAs
19:33:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "anupritaisno1: also need a scrip"> I already have some very broken code
19:34:02 <cn3m[m]> Techlore banned madaidan and cyredanthem which are strongly in our camp
19:34:03 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: Updater has support for it
19:34:11 <strcat> cn3m[m]: techlore did or his mods did?
19:35:05 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "cn3m: they have 2 telegram chann"> https://t.me/samouraiwallet and https://t.me/samouraifunny
19:35:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "maybe issue is it doesn't trust "> What about self-signed?
19:35:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Madaidan was an admin
19:35:45 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it needs to be a valid Web PKI cert
19:35:55 <strcat> I just think there is some stricter check maybe it doesn't trust cross-signed CAs
19:35:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> On telegram only the admin who promotes you and the owner can ban you
19:35:59 <cn3m[m]> not entirely sure
19:36:01 <strcat> which Let's Encrypt still is with the default cert chain
19:36:07 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "cn3m: techlore did or his mods d"> Techlore himself wanted me gone from his entire community
19:36:12 <cn3m[m]> not entirely sure
19:36:21 <cyredanthem[m]> Hey he banned me I think since he was the only mod on
19:36:24 <cyredanthem[m]> I hadn't talked in a while
19:36:35 <madaidan[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Madaidan was an admin"> I got demoted a while before that for more bullshit reasons
19:37:18 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: strcat by default update engine only trusts certs_google instead of all certs, so you need a cert with a common root with Google which lets encrypt doesn't have anymore
19:37:26 <cdesai> But it's a one line change
19:37:43 <cdesai> grep -r cacerts_google system/update_engine
19:38:14 * anupritaisno1[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/pqARswooqNOmyVpCNOQVuCqK >
19:38:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah got it
19:38:35 <strcat> DannyWorkOrderPr: which channel is this happening in btw
19:38:38 <dazinism> <madaidan[m] "Samourai bans anyone debunking t"> Milkman bans anyone who questions him. Is anyone in his big cybersecurity room? (actually it someone called fractal who is admin, but gave him all power over that room)
19:38:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat that is what I'm doing
19:39:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just generate all metadata beforehand and then parse in the app
19:39:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> But I'm not shipping this yet
19:39:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Notice how I don't close any input stream, causing memory leaks
19:39:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also I am lost at how to validate the output
19:39:52 <madaidan[m]> <dazinism "Milkman bans anyone who question"> I'm in it.
19:40:59 <strcat> cyredanthem[m]: where were you banned from?
19:42:09 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/blob/10/src/app/seamlessupdate/client/Service.java#L96
19:42:17 <strcat> this is the existing code for streaming updates
19:42:27 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it already works if you fix the CA issue
19:42:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW sorry about that spam
19:42:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will use github gist next time
19:42:39 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: but 'works' means it downloads the payload 2x since the payload is in the zip file
19:42:55 <strcat> so this needs to have a new name for the streaming update zip
19:43:01 <strcat> and need that to get generated
19:43:13 <strcat> it can get the payload from the old style zip
19:43:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> I have very similar behavior on the lineageos client that I was working on
19:43:16 <strcat> that's fine - it works already
19:43:30 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: they used an early revision of my code
19:43:32 <strcat> btw
19:43:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> But now I have the impression that lineage's is beyond repair
19:43:36 <strcat> ~50 lines of it
19:43:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "anupritaisno1: but 'works' means"> Yeah that's what I mean to fix
19:43:55 <strcat>             Log.d(TAG, "streaming update test");
19:43:57 <strcat>             final SharedPreferences preferences = Settings.getPreferences(this);
19:43:59 <strcat>             final String downloadFile = preferences.getString(PREFERENCE_DOWNLOAD_FILE, null);
19:44:01 <strcat>             engine.applyPayload(getString(R.string.url) + downloadFile, payloadOffset, 0, headerKeyValuePairs);
19:44:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically lineage treats A/B updates like A-only until the application part
19:44:03 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: this part is correct already
19:44:05 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it makes sense for that to use the old style zip
19:44:17 <cdesai> Does that recovery update sample handle streaming?
19:44:47 <strcat> cdesai: well Updater has streaming update support already it's just hidden behind a property + not useful due to not dling a lightweight metadata zip
19:45:13 <strcat> basically all that's needed is fixing the CA issue + downloading a lightweight metadata zip and it'll work
19:45:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes but that also means they trigger recoverysystem..verifypackage() for A/B which is an unnecessary check
19:45:17 <strcat> and then later remove the property check
19:45:34 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it is not entirely unnecessary
19:45:34 <cdesai> Yeah it does work well, especially with deltas where the download penalty isn't that high
19:45:51 <dazinism> If anyone has been in their for a while, bet if you do a search for GrapheneOS you'll find some vicious Milkman rants against GrapheneOS / Daniel
19:46:28 <strcat> dazinism: someone actually handed control of something to milkman?
19:46:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "basically all that's needed is f"> I'll try this approach out, thanks
19:46:47 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: if you are already using Updater just fix the CA issue cdesai  mentioned
19:46:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> So strcat I use that java to generate my metadata and then ship it into a signed metadata zip the updater can verify?
19:46:54 <strcat> and try setting sys.update.streaming_test to true
19:47:15 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: this is the Updater code
19:47:19 <strcat> I am not sure what you mean
19:47:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> No but I plan to soon
19:47:57 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: first use Updater using the standard generate_metadata.py + this Updater client app
19:48:03 <strcat> it doesn't require anything more than a static web server
19:48:11 <dazinism> Need to have been in the room to search
19:48:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> I meant signing a metadata zip with the releasekey and letting updater verify it
19:48:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then extracting that zip to get the metadata
19:48:34 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: the standard zip is already the right thing other than including payload.bin
19:48:38 <strcat> just need to omit payload.bin
19:48:44 <strcat> generate a 2nd update zip with no payload.bin
19:48:56 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: the script to do this is the ota_from_target_files script
19:49:03 <strcat> it needs to generate a 2nd zip with no payload.bin
19:49:06 <strcat> it's pretty simple
19:49:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "generate a 2nd update zip with n"> Yes exactly what I meant
19:49:17 <strcat> and then when doing a streaming update, this code needs to use the lightweight zip
19:49:19 <strcat> instead of the full zip
19:49:25 <strcat> for the initial download
19:49:47 <strcat> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/blob/10/src/app/seamlessupdate/client/Service.java#L256
19:49:52 <madaidan[m]> <strcat "cyredanthem: where were you bann"> He was banned from the Techlore room
19:49:56 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: it needs to check if it's in streaming mode here
19:49:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "and then when doing a streaming "> I will try to implement this
19:49:59 <dazinism> <strcat "dazinism: someone actually hande"> The bit I had trouble parsing is when I asked them why they left it with Milkman they said that lots of people speak highly of him and like his mod style?!?
19:50:10 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: and if it's in streaming mode
19:50:15 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: dl the lightweight zip instead
19:50:25 <strcat> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_Updater/blob/10/src/app/seamlessupdate/client/Service.java#L100
19:50:27 <strcat> this is already right
19:50:39 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: so basically existing zip is signed zip with metadata + payload.bin
19:50:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah got it
19:50:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks
19:50:57 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: payload.bin is stored uncompressed in the zip and it can be downloaded using the offset like this
19:51:08 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: so no need to have a separate payload.bin
19:51:38 <strcat> cdesai: do you have a link to the update_engine CA issue
19:51:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Already read the docs and see the java code up
19:51:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is already calculating a zip offset
19:52:23 <aeonsolution[m]> hey strcat is there a place in android-prepare-vendor I can help contribute with, how far back did you revert? Do you have a commit I can start from to work on my side.
19:52:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "hey strcat is there a place in a"> Yes
19:52:42 <cdesai> strcat: just change cacerts_google to cacerts in update_engine, it's a constant.
19:52:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Figure out what's wrong with dexopt for vendor apps
19:52:57 <cdesai> I didn't change it yet because I wasn't sure if we'd want to limit it to a subset too
19:53:17 <aeonsolution[m]> let me look, thanks anupritaisno1:
19:54:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Figure out what's wrong with dex"> Also strcat I reproduced this issue on a oneplus 3
19:54:39 <aeonsolution[m]>  * let me look, thanks anupritaisno1
19:54:49 <cdesai> aeonsolution[m]: you can also check #AOSPAlliance logs, I was talking with renlord about how to remove what's in aosp already from vendor
19:54:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dexpreopting lineage parts with speed caused system UI to repeatedly crash on a oneplus 3
19:54:57 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: the one with android-prepare-vendor needing LOCAL_PREOPT := false?
19:55:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Looking at logs exactly the same issue you had with the vendor apps
19:55:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> I couldn't fix it btw
19:55:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just disabled dexpreopt for that component as it seems lineage had disabled it until android 7 came out
19:55:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> And idk why it doesn't crash on anything newer than that
19:55:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yep
19:55:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It happened in 2 places on 2 legacy devices
19:55:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> But nothing on current gen ones
19:56:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> On the oneplus 2 same component when dexopted broke a small tri state slider that's standard on all oneplus phones
19:56:30 <strcat> I don't know if it's still an issue
19:56:31 <aeonsolution[m]> thanks
19:56:35 <strcat> I think aeonsolution[m] ran into it
19:56:43 <strcat> because atm in the dev branch
19:56:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> But since the issue was only apparent on the oneplus 3 crashing
19:56:48 <strcat> I didn't reapply the LOCAL_PREOPT := false change
19:57:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I never noticed it happen on the oneplus 2 until I had fixed it on the oneplus 3
19:57:06 <strcat> when I switched to the aosp alliance android-prepare-vendor I forgot to add it back
19:57:11 <strcat> and it seemed to work fine without it now
19:57:12 <aeonsolution[m]> <cdesai "aeonsolution: you can also check"> let me check that out and with dexopt like anupritaisno1 mentioned
19:57:15 <strcat> lemme try a factory reset
19:57:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well if anything
19:57:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wiping dalvik seems to alleviate the issue
19:57:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> But
19:57:54 <strcat> ah yeah
19:57:57 <strcat> factory reset caused it
19:57:59 <strcat> makes sense
19:58:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not a solution
19:58:20 <strcat> I'll add back my workaround
19:58:26 <strcat> it's a serious issue and needs to be resolved ASAP
19:58:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> The issue can come back to the oneplus 3, just a matter of time before it does
19:59:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
20:00:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let me know if you do
20:00:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> I couldn't figure it out at all
20:00:36 <cdesai> Lineage has better handling of vendor these days
20:00:47 <cdesai> The extraction scripts are in vendor/lineage
20:00:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also something more strange

20:01:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> You see that?

20:02:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wow what the hell happened there
20:02:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> This seems to be some kind of an issue that only happens on the product partition
20:02:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't see this happen on system or vendor
20:03:36 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: nah not tied to that
20:03:44 <strcat> it just happens that on your device qcril stuff is there
20:03:51 <strcat> on Pixel 3a it's on system
20:04:03 <strcat> on Pixel 4 I think it moved
20:04:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's hope google fixes that on R
20:04:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also strcat what if we set dexopt to nostripping instead?
20:04:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sm8150, same CPU as p4
20:05:06 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: might work around it by having it fall back to another method
20:05:08 <strcat> but it's not a fix
20:05:15 <strcat> and it's only for these prebuilt vendor files
20:05:18 <strcat> I don't know what the problem is
20:05:22 <strcat> it's a serious issue that needs to be fixed
20:05:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try the nostripping maybe?
20:05:31 <strcat> among others
20:05:35 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: that would be a workaround not a fix
20:05:49 <strcat> I'd rather not dexpreopt these if it's broken
20:05:58 <strcat> added back my workaround to the new android-prepare-vendor
20:06:05 <aeonsolution[m]> I can test any changes for the Pixel 3a, just let me know. I'm still looking around trying to figure out the dex stuff
20:06:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "it's a serious issue that needs "> You've said that thrice now we get it
20:07:04 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: I worked around it already

20:07:09 <strcat> aeonsolution[m]: it's NOT fixed - just worked around again
20:07:23 <strcat> cx2[m]: that's normal/expected

20:09:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assume attacker somehow manages to compromise the recovery
20:09:33 <strcat[m]> it's not a major issue at all
20:09:45 <cx2[m]> GOT IT! Ok great then up and running.
20:09:45 <cx2[m]> Now, can I reflash my other handsets to the beta channel so that while I am sitting in COVID-19 hell, i can run CTS on all of them
20:09:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat "fastboot checks for stuff to fla"> BTW how much of a risk is fastbootd?
20:09:52 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1:  if they 'somehow manage to compromise the recovery' it's not relevant anymore
20:10:23 <strcat[m]> it's some extra recovery attack surface and hardly any at that
20:10:37 <strcat[m]> it's not a substantial difference from how it was before
20:10:38 <strcat[m]> recovery is less privileged than the bootloader fastboot mode
20:10:48 <strcat[m]> it reduces the privileges from what they were before
20:10:53 <strcat[m]> recovery can't flash the AVB key or unlock
20:10:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Alright I guess
20:10:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> So secure boot still protects?
20:11:19 <strcat[m]> yes recovery can't unlock, it's better that this code is in recovery than fastboot mode in terms of attack surface
20:11:34 <strcat[m]> recovery can't flash avb key / unlock since it's just root
20:11:51 <strcat[m]> also you can't flash images when locked anyway
20:12:01 <strcat[m]> so it barely adds attack surface
20:12:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it can flash
20:12:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just have concern about the
20:12:40 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it doesn't allow flashing when locked and the attack surface is better in recovery than fastboot mode
20:12:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Firmware partitions that are just FAT and never avb checked
20:12:48 <strcat[m]> because fastboot mode has much more privileges than root
20:12:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or is that a completely meaningless concern?
20:12:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: which partitions?
20:13:05 <strcat[m]> firmware is supposed to be verified by verified boot
20:13:22 <strcat[m]> there is a /persist partition with some data but the worst that can happen is basically bricking the device / functionality it has
20:13:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: it doesn't allow "> During development I use builds that allow flashing for now even when locked
20:13:31 <strcat[m]> like wiping the encrypted TEE attestation keys that are there
20:14:05 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I am talking about production - flashing is not allowed when locked, only sideloading a signed OTA update
20:14:28 <strcat[m]> and verified boot (at least on devices properly implementing it) verifies the OS via the AVB key that's flashed onto the device
20:14:31 <strcat[m]> and does rollback protection
20:14:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "like wiping the encrypted TEE at"> Pixel stores those there?
20:14:45 <strcat[m]> that's a separate thing from the keymaster integration for verified boot state / OS version
20:14:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes they are encrypted with a key only available to TEE
20:14:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "and verified boot (at least on d"> Yeah that too is a big problem
20:14:59 <strcat[m]> and stored in /persist
20:15:14 <strcat[m]> that's for the TEE attestation - StrongBox has those attestation keys internally
20:15:37 <strcat[m]> the TEE doesn't have internal storage, instead it has provisioned keys in /persist that are encrypted and then the data it stores via the OS in userdata
20:15:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> What about Qualcomm's fancy wrappedkey FBE?
20:15:45 <strcat[m]> it encrypts the data and then stores it in the OS
20:15:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: what about it?
20:16:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: what about it?"> Is it any different?
20:16:22 <strcat[m]> that's a different thing
20:16:27 <strcat[m]> unrelated to verified boot
20:16:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay so it still goes to persist?
20:16:45 <strcat[m]> uh I'm confused now
20:16:52 <strcat[m]> I never said anything is stored in persist at runtime
20:16:57 <strcat[m]> what keys do you think I'm talking about
20:17:10 <strcat[m]> I think you misunderstand what I said - I didn't say what you think I did
20:17:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> So pixel doesn't have a couple of vfat partitions for modem and bt-firmware unlike most others?
20:17:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "what keys do you think I'm talki"> Encryption keys?
20:17:23 <strcat[m]> encryption keys are never stored unencrypted and they have nothing to do with /persist
20:17:28 <strcat[m]> I never said anything about encryption keys
20:17:32 <strcat[m]> that's a different topic
20:17:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> On okay
20:17:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry got you
20:17:54 <strcat[m]> I said that the TEE attestation keys (NOT encryption keys or anything to do with disk encryption) are provisioned into /persist
20:18:02 <strcat[m]> and they are encrypted with a key only available to the TEE
20:18:05 <strcat[m]> the TEE hardware-bound key
20:18:16 <strcat[m]> in fact the TEE firmware can't access that key
20:18:21 <strcat[m]> it's only available to the hardware
20:18:31 <strcat[m]> the TEE can only use the key
20:18:40 <strcat[m]> so the way the TEE gets the attestation keys is it decrypts them from /persist
20:18:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah makes sense
20:18:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also what about the vfat partitions?
20:18:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the TEE-based keystore stores the keys in the OS via an OS daemon
20:18:58 <strcat[m]> it encrypts the data
20:19:01 <strcat[m]> then stores it in the OS
20:19:04 <strcat[m]> that's how the TEE stores data
20:19:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay interesting
20:19:17 <strcat[m]> the newer StrongBox keystore is an HSM with internal secure storage
20:19:28 <strcat[m]> it works differently and provides a higher level of security / isolation from the OS
20:19:36 <strcat[m]> it is a separate SoC with secure storage + secure timer
20:19:43 <strcat[m]> tamper resistant / evident
20:19:53 <strcat[m]> i.e. the Titan M
20:19:59 <strcat[m]> which provides the StrongBox keystore on Pixels
20:20:12 <strcat[m]> Samsung's new generation Qualcomm phones use the Qualcomm SPU to provide StrongBox keystore
20:20:30 <strcat[m]> it's similar but probably doesn't have insider attack protection like the Pixel's Titan M - dunno
20:20:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wonder when this will be mainstream
20:20:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: dunno which vfat partitions you mean
20:20:49 <strcat[m]> but in general
20:21:01 <strcat[m]> firmware is all supposed to be verified other than some small state partitions for provisioned state
20:21:06 <strcat[m]> and those are not supposed to be trusted
20:21:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: dunno which vfat "> Most Qualcomm devices have 3 partitions that are never avb backed
20:21:32 <strcat[m]> and they should generally be made read-only after provisioning the device
20:21:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: AVB is for verifying the OS not firmware
20:21:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> A modem firmware partition, a bt-firmware partition and a dsp partition
20:21:50 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: Qualcomm Secure Boot verifies firmware
20:22:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: there are more partitions than those
20:22:08 <strcat[m]> there are a dozen firmware partitions
20:22:22 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: AVB is how the final boot stage before the OS verifies the OS and then how the OS verifies itself
20:22:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah but pixel 4 doesn't flash any from what I see?
20:22:32 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: don't know what you mean by that
20:22:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: don't know what y"> Those files are not in the factory images from what I see
20:22:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: Qualcomm Secure Boot is what verifies earlier boot stages
20:23:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay
20:23:07 <strcat[m]> that is how the firmware partitions are verified
20:23:15 <strcat[m]> then AVB verifies the OS
20:23:33 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: Pixel factory images generally have all these partitions bundled into a bootloader.img and radio.img
20:23:55 <strcat[m]> those are not partitions
20:24:02 <strcat[m]> you can extract them
20:24:16 <strcat[m]> they are just an archive format for bundling a bunch of signed images
20:24:28 <strcat[m]> rather than having 12 different loose firmware images
20:24:33 <strcat[m]> since the version is supposed to match across them and it'd be a bad idea to flash them individually
20:24:42 <strcat[m]> so they are flashed together
20:25:05 <strcat[m]> now that there are A/B updates it's less serious but it would have been super easy to brick devices without having them bundled into bootloader.img
20:25:19 <strcat[m]> cause you could brick it by flashing just some of those images
20:25:25 <strcat[m]> A/B updates largely alleviates this
20:26:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW how fast is Qualcomm secure boot exactly?
20:26:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> On my device the modem partition seems to be 200mb in size
20:29:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: Pixel factory ima"> Ah that clears it
20:30:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Thanks
20:30:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW does graphene currently flash these partitions through the A/B updater?
20:30:33 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: well I don't think it blocks booting other stuff
20:30:38 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really matter how long it takes to bring up the modem
20:30:42 <strcat[m]> the modem partition is not just the cellular implementation, it's also Wi-Fi, etc.
20:30:43 <strcat[m]> each thing runs in a sandbox on it
20:34:07 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes this is part of the regular updates
20:34:11 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: they have A/B partitions
20:34:15 <strcat[m]> the regular update system deals with it
20:34:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can non-AB partitions be updated?
20:35:28 <strcat[m]> abl.img  aop.img  bootloader.img  cmnlib64.img  cmnlib.img  devcfg.img  hyp.img  keymaster.img  modem.img  qupfw.img  radio.img  tz.img  xbl_config.img  xbl.img
20:35:31 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: these are A/B partitions
20:35:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> While the system is running
20:35:49 <strcat[m]> everything is an A/B partition
20:35:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
20:35:57 <strcat[m]> firmware and OS are A/B partitions
20:35:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm trying to figure this out for my device and
20:36:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's a partition my manufacturer flashes
20:36:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> That is not an A/B partition
20:36:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't know how stock flashes it
20:36:54 <strcat[m]> if there is a non-A/B firmware partition, I assume it can be updated while the OS is running, but it's not really supposed to be that way
20:37:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> But it's not an A/B partition and it somehow gets flashed by the updater is all I know
20:37:45 <strcat[m]> look at gpt-utils
20:37:46 <strcat[m]> qualcomm thing
20:37:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Static_nvbk is the name

21:46:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat can you upgrade the chromium base to 83?
21:46:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> 83 fixes the weird browser crash issue I had
21:47:47 <cn3m[m]> funny I get crashes in 83 on Bromite, but not Vanadium 81
21:48:22 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: we track the stable releases
21:48:33 <strcat> looks like 83 is now stable
21:48:45 <strcat> people are welcome to help migrate
21:48:47 <strcat> it's a lot of work
21:50:05 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200521-031339_Browser.png (487KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/hFQmcEcHkScaxheggupHvgmr >
21:50:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> On bromite with 83 base the page is usable

21:50:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> On vanadium, the latest 81 the browser freezes
21:50:37 <strcat> we migrate to each new stable release
21:50:40 <strcat> you're welcome to help
21:50:53 <strcat> I don't have time to do everything myself
21:51:06 <strcat> unfortunately I've been doing most of the Vanadium ports by myself
21:53:12 <aeonsolution[m]> anupritaisno1: I can help you out!
21:59:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will see what I can do strcat
21:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't have enough resources to do a full chromium build at least right now
22:36:36 <aeonsolution[m]> i can build chromium i think, let me check. is it more than building vanadium?
22:40:10 <strcat> need to sync the new code, rebase onto it
22:40:13 <strcat> build and make sure it works
22:40:14 <strcat> fix any problems
22:40:18 <strcat> it's a LOT of work to do regularly
22:43:28 <aeonsolution[m]> maybe i can just focus on learning to do that for vanadium, and for the 10 branch, i can just build the os and test if it works for the pixel 3a?
22:43:41 <aeonsolution[m]> does that sound good to you?
22:44:12 <aeonsolution[m]>  * maybe i can just focus on learning to do that for vanadium, and for the 10 branch, i can just build the os and test if the commited changes work for the pixel 3a?
23:26:02 <madaidan[m]> Does linux-hardened's ASLR improvements make it as good as PaX's ASLR? I've seen strcat's comparison and it looks like it basically is but I want to be sure.
