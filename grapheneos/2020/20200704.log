04:47:34 <ruddo[m]> <outsider[m]1 ""encrypted sims" and overpriced "> I dont think they were using Pixels.  Either way, trust in proprietary software really fucked them up.  Looks like they all got malware targeted to their phones â€” is this doable via the baseband?
04:47:48 <greenmoon[m]> I known it from the beginning that this site was targeting criminals. Also their site is full of trackers lol
04:48:06 <outsider[m]1> <ruddo[m] "I dont think they were using Pix"> encro wasnt on pixels. was roasting omerta
04:48:20 <brenneke[m]> <outsider[m]1 "simple calendar isnt bad"> Don't doubt it, Simple apps are good but they are simple.
04:49:34 <outsider[m]1> <outsider[m]1 "encro wasnt on pixels. was roast"> from what i understand, they got popped from shitty infrastructure and terrible encryption implementation
04:49:54 <outsider[m]1> had they been less centralized, prob wouldve only had minor casualties
04:51:09 <ruddo[m]> I would like to know how they got compromised.
04:51:30 <brenneke[m]> <greenmoon[m] "In that vice article about endro"> Personally find it difficult to imagine that there will ever be trust in a system like that again.
04:51:37 <ruddo[m]> In any case it's pretty clear that a phone with secure messaging and a phone that plays media or surfs the web are 100% incompatible.
04:56:10 <greenmoon[m]> A malware have been pushed to the ROM according the article
04:56:48 <greenmoon[m]> Do we need a malware pushed to our privacy ROM when they will try to take down omerta?? Lol
04:57:51 <greenmoon[m]> Hopefully they will target only the service used by their phone
04:58:06 <greenmoon[m]> * Hopefully they will target only the services used by their phones
05:03:33 <ruddo[m]> <greenmoon[m] "A malware have been pushed to th"> I am skeptical that the article got that detail right.
05:04:09 <ruddo[m]> It's most likely an exploit that deployed a persistent RAT.
05:04:17 <ruddo[m]> That would not go in the ROM.

05:04:56 <greenmoon[m]> Hmm yea
05:05:46 <greenmoon[m]> But they sent it to all users of the rom
05:06:11 <ruddo[m]> Who?  The phone manufacturer is the only group who can pull that off.
05:07:21 <greenmoon[m]> And it used the update system according another article, their update system was maybe not secured
05:08:22 <greenmoon[m]> I don't even know how its possible if updates are signed

05:15:51 <ruddo[m]> Epic, epic incompetence on the part of those encromorons.
05:26:49 <renor> Does GOS have problems with funding? There's someone on reddit saying so
05:33:10 <cyredanthem[m]1> renor: in a word no
05:33:12 <cyredanthem[m]1> Contributions are the goal
05:35:07 <renor> Yeah.. I know..., Daniel always says so, but I thought that maybe there was something I missed lately

05:48:03 <greenmoon[m]> <ruddo[m] "Who?  The phone manufacturer is "> It was user apps updates I guess, not phone updates.
05:48:08 <alicebobandeve[m> Due to the above message being a copy/paste from Joplin, mentions did not work so just adding them here strcat renlord anupritaisno1 , also madaidan. in case you know something about this.
05:48:46 <cyredanthem[m]1> alicebobandeve: GrapheneOS is all open source even all the server stuff you need
05:48:51 <cyredanthem[m]1> You could host it all yourself to minimize trust
05:49:16 <cyredanthem[m]1> Daniel has proven himself with the whole Copperhead situation (Copperhead user here)
05:49:36 <cyredanthem[m]1> This is a very unique situation and I trust this project in spite of me not being very trusting
05:50:13 <alicebobandeve[m> cyredanthem: copperhead user as well. That's not the question though, not everyone is capable of building and that includes journalists.
05:50:23 <cyredanthem[m]1> Daniel also thoroughly checks all contributions himself
05:50:55 <cyredanthem[m]1> Renlord and anu couldn't backdoor it if they wanted too(they most certainly don't)
05:51:02 <alicebobandeve[m> Again not relevantcyredanthem please let the answers come from the devs themselves
05:52:18 <cyredanthem[m]1> You are absolutely missing the point. There's no absolute trust you can have in anything. There's no guarantees in this world
05:52:53 <cyredanthem[m]1> Trust is subjective
05:53:22 <cyredanthem[m]1> GrapheneOS does the best they can by letting you build and host everything yourself and by having one person manage the contributions and offline building
05:53:29 <alicebobandeve[m> cyredanthem: it's not about me missing the point lol, it's other users which include users who cannot build it themselves.
05:53:38 <cyredanthem[m]1> Less points of failure
05:53:44 <alicebobandeve[m> Please wait for devs to respond cyredanthem thanks
05:55:05 <cyredanthem[m]1> <cyredanthem[m]1 "Less points of failure"> alicebobandeve: you should clarify what you are looking for since you're not making any sense
05:56:12 <alicebobandeve[m> cyredanthem: I've mentioned everything needed for an answer so unless Daniel needs further clarification, I'll provide it, until then, let's not spam this discussion and let the devs respond.
05:56:12 <cyredanthem[m]1> A lot of the things you brought up don't make sense or wouldn't practically effect trust.
06:01:54 <alicebobandeve[m> <cyredanthem[m]1 "GrapheneOS does the best they ca"> Also, this is known as SPOF if you look at it practically. So let's hold up and let Daniel respond. If I'm wrong or if the question is not relevant, I'll be happy to admit it and face the brunt for it from strcat when he responds.
06:03:06 <cyredanthem[m]1> You probably should think through and explain your questions better. I don't think many of them make sense in a practical trust model for a community project. What do I know
06:04:19 <alicebobandeve[m> cyredanthem: I hate it when people argue with others confidently but end their sentence with what do I know, if you don't know, could you please just let someone who knows respond?
06:04:36 <alicebobandeve[m> Patience
06:05:07 <cyredanthem[m]1> You're dimissing my questions and concerns about your question. My apologies for the sarcasm ðŸ˜‚
06:06:40 <cyredanthem[m]1> Welcome
06:07:58 <alicebobandeve[m> cyredanthem: you are still missing the point, if I had to ask the community, I would have framed my question that way, I'm posing the questions to the devs responsible for the project. It's not a debate.
06:08:35 <cyredanthem[m]1> All I'm asking you is to think through your question more
06:09:20 <alicebobandeve[m> cyredanthem: thanks for the suggestion but what do you know right? Patience.
06:09:57 <cyredanthem[m]1> I'm saying you should put more effort into your question and the community can help you with that
06:10:08 <cyredanthem[m]1> That's how I see it anyway
06:18:13 <TheJollyRoger> alicebobandeve[m: this is bikeshedding. cyredanthem[m]1's already said it: the code is open, the builds are reproducible, Daniel signs the builds and inspects them and has actually /fought back/ in the face of legal threats.
07:56:00 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey what happened, did I get removed from the channel ?
08:00:17 <TheJollyRoger> Hi mrxx_0[m], welcome back. Were you removed from the channel? Probably yes, but likely not by a moderator; it's far more likely that what happened was that the bridge between Matrix and Freenode hiccuped and kicked you off.
08:00:51 <TheJollyRoger> This occasionally happens from time to time.
08:01:22 <TheJollyRoger> When it does, just rejoin the channel and carry on.
08:21:41 <hitchhooker[m]> ah so Pixel 3A are getting out of the market too :/
08:22:13 <JTL> Tis a shame
08:23:30 <TheJollyRoger> Too soon :(
08:26:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renor "Does GOS have problems with fund"> Yes we need funding for our legal issues
08:27:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <renor "Yeah.. I know..., Daniel always "> Funding will not help development because it will be used to fight the legal issues created by James. Contributions are needed for helping in development

08:31:50 <strcat[m]> most people are probably a lot worse off building it themselves and securing their own build environment + signing keys
08:32:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Even if they follow the instructions on the site?
08:33:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> If that's his threat model though it's the only option he's got
08:41:02 <strcat[m]> alicebobandeve: it's open source and the builds are reproducible - I'm not sure what more there could be with the size / resources available
08:41:25 <strcat[m]> alicebobandeve: you say there's a single of failure but would you rather have multiple points of failure that are equally damaging
08:41:35 <strcat[m]> multiple people with access to the official build infrastructure and signing keys?
08:41:40 <strcat[m]> that's not an improvement
08:42:41 <strcat[m]> so I'm not sure what you expect
08:43:17 <strcat[m]> if people want to make their own builds and use a decentralized trust model where 3/5 signatures are required for update packages or something like that they're welcome to but I'm not planning on added more trusted parties / blockers to development
08:43:39 <JTL> I think given the current state of things, is a fair response
08:43:41 <strcat[m]> make a fork with that model if you want - good luck finding trustworthy, productive people with the same goals who will stay interested long-term
08:43:50 <strcat[m]> and handle replacement of those people over time somehow
08:44:08 <strcat[m]> I can't think of any OS that works that way
08:44:33 <strcat[m]> it's open source so people are free to do that if that's what they want
08:44:40 <strcat[m]> I don't think it's going to turn out well
08:44:46 <hypokeimenon[m]> what about the dead man's switch?
08:46:07 <strcat[m]> ?
08:46:10 <strcat[m]> not sure what you mean
08:46:18 <alicebobandeve[m> Hi
08:46:24 <alicebobandeve[m> Thanks for the replies
08:46:33 <alicebobandeve[m> Sorry my replies might be slow, caught up with something
08:47:15 <alicebobandeve[m> I'm actually not talking about myself, my threat model doesn't require it.
08:47:41 <strcat[m]> okay so take snowden as an example then
08:47:57 <strcat[m]> who are 4 other highly trustworthy people in countries without oppressive / coercive laws
08:47:59 <strcat[m]> involved with the project
08:48:05 <strcat[m]> who are highly technical and able to secure signing keys well
08:48:16 <strcat[m]> and also some more people since people might need to be replaced
08:49:18 <alicebobandeve[m> A team in my company has over 200 people and they want to switch as mentioned earlier, your suggestion is we should build it ourselves? They completed testing today and their concern is basically SPOF and risk mitigation.
08:49:53 <alicebobandeve[m> Also, a few journalists from my country want to use it, people I know.
08:50:06 <alicebobandeve[m> All based on my suggestions.
08:50:26 <JTL> Should read up DNSSEC key ceremonies if you want to bikeshed multiple signatures for OS builds, etc.
08:50:30 <alicebobandeve[m> So obviously, I have no intention of undermining GOS.
08:51:13 <strcat[m]> no my suggestion isn't to build it yourself
08:51:25 <alicebobandeve[m> I understand your point strcat
08:51:33 <strcat[m]> my suggestion is to realize that most open source software projects including core infrastructure are developed by 1 person
08:51:38 <strcat[m]> with a few contributors at most
08:51:42 <strcat[m]> and little funding / support
08:52:01 <alicebobandeve[m> Agreed, I have to get corporate to agree and the guy in charge is smart but very paranoid.
08:52:12 <strcat[m]> I can't name a single core infra android/linux project that uses N-of-M signing key releases
08:52:12 <alicebobandeve[m> Absolutely
08:52:45 <alicebobandeve[m> Interesting point
08:52:52 <strcat[m]> and I don't actually want to do it because I don't want to trust other people
08:52:58 <strcat[m]> if people want to do that they should make their own builds
08:53:14 <alicebobandeve[m> Fair
08:54:57 <alicebobandeve[m> I was on a call an hr back trying to explain to them this exact thing so I don't think otherwise either but I was wondering if there's already something in place to mitigate SPOF so that I could share it with them.
08:55:07 <alicebobandeve[m> But your points are valid and I agree.
08:58:36 <strcat[m]> open source + reproducible builds for as much as that accomplishes
08:58:40 <alicebobandeve[m> But asking questions such as the ones I posted are not obvious or indulge in bikeshedding. They were posed for the sake of clarity.
08:58:42 <strcat[m]> not sure what else can be expected
08:58:52 <alicebobandeve[m> <strcat[m] "open source + reproducible build"> Will move it forward
08:58:56 <alicebobandeve[m> And let them know
08:59:01 <strcat[m]> a project like a typical linux distribution is many point failure - many trusted people
08:59:03 <strcat[m]> 1 person can do great harm
08:59:06 <alicebobandeve[m> Thanks for your replies.
08:59:08 <strcat[m]> and hundreds are trusted
08:59:12 <strcat[m]> that's not a better system
08:59:16 <alicebobandeve[m> Yeo
08:59:22 <joshman[m]> Sorry. Prolly answered 100 times. Nothing found in logs. How to screenshot Vanadium in incognito mode?
08:59:26 <alicebobandeve[m> Yep*
08:59:33 <dazinism> Guess if part the worry is Daniel dying. Then theres seedvault backups that could be used to migrate to another OS that includes seedvault
08:59:47 <alicebobandeve[m> <dazinism "Guess if part the worry is Danie"> Umm, no lol.
09:00:01 <alicebobandeve[m> Dead man's switch should not be taken literally lol
09:00:40 <alicebobandeve[m> But yes, I'm aware.
09:01:42 <dazinism> josh.man: the point is you can't
09:01:45 <alicebobandeve[m> Even I was not of the opinion that they should build it themselves strcat
09:02:25 <alicebobandeve[m> So I'll try and get it through their thick heads
09:02:42 <alicebobandeve[m> Thanks strcat and anupritaisno1
09:03:47 <hitchhooker[m]> so if organization builds their own build with multisig, they also need to be deliver the updates too?
09:04:14 <TheJollyRoger> Of course they have to; the phone will only accept updates from those keys once they've been provisioned.
09:04:37 <alicebobandeve[m> It would involve cherry-picks from upstream but yes they are responsible for it
09:04:43 <TheJollyRoger> So if they want to hold their own keys, they take matters into their own hands. This includes running their own update server.
09:04:55 <hitchhooker[m]> is update infra open source as well?
09:05:16 <alicebobandeve[m> TheJollyRoger: exactly
09:06:11 <dazinism> hitchhooker: yeah
09:06:16 <TheJollyRoger> hitchhooker[m]: yes.
09:07:00 <alicebobandeve[m> Everything is open source hitchhooker
09:08:32 <alicebobandeve[m> Coral has kernel pre-builts correct? anupritaisno1
09:09:20 <dazinism> Would also need to build auditor & attestation server if they wanted that, or get Daniel to add the sigs for their OS builds to his Auditor
09:10:20 <alicebobandeve[m> Yes
09:10:41 <alicebobandeve[m> I'm aware

09:41:38 <glct[m]> Hello all I joined barely 10 hours ago and mostly observing the good conversations so far.
09:41:38 <glct[m]> Noticed that this chat isn't encrypted, I mean it doesn't look like sensitive chat and with the channel essentially open there aren't any secrets shared here openly but if we have the encryption feature, why not use it?
09:41:38 <glct[m]> I'm aware there are probably good reasons as to why it isn't been enabled but thought I'd put this out there. I am new to Matrix so I'm learning on two fronts, getting round this new messenger and GOS :-)
09:44:06 <hitchhooker[m]> its public discourse and logs are intentionally shared online as well
09:47:06 <glct[m]> <hitchhooker[m] "its public discourse and logs ar"> This makes sense, thanks.
09:49:10 <hitchhooker[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200704 searching here first is quite useful before committing question
10:00:24 <cyredanthem[m]1> > The Titan M is closed source right?
10:00:24 <cyredanthem[m]1> Yes, it's a closed source component the OS doesn't have direct control over.
10:02:11 <cyredanthem[m]1> (y)
10:07:24 <madaidan[m]> There are plans to open source it but they've been stalled for eons
10:08:57 <geritol[m]> Thanks

10:22:15 <hitchhooker[m]> opentitan looks promising tho
14:28:40 <FinnwwwBackFromt> Can Graphene be like Gentoo?
14:36:17 <neonfuz2> So I put music on my phone and its not showing up on my vanilla music app
14:36:38 <neonfuz2> I tried the SD scanner app too
14:38:55 <neonfuz2> Â¡Finnwww Back From the Dead! Like gentoo in what ways
14:40:15 <FinnwwwBackFromt> <neonfuz2 "Â¡Finnwww Back From the Dead! Lik"> Have a package manager that helps you compile everything yourself
14:42:04 <neonfuz2> No not really, graphene is just a security focused fork of AOSP. It doesn't add any ability to compile apps on the device
14:42:45 <FinnwwwBackFromt> Can I compile my own kernel?
14:44:01 <neonfuz2> Yes but part of the security of graphene is checking system integrity at boot, adding your own kernel would make this fail and so this is against the point of graphene
14:44:15 <neonfuz2> though
14:44:37 <FinnwwwBackFromt> Ah
14:44:44 <neonfuz2> If you want you can compile all of graphene youeself and sign it yourself and make your own update server
14:44:59 <q22[m]> neonfuz do your audio files show up in the file manager?
14:45:12 <neonfuz2> Graphene is not meant for maximized custom ability its meant for maximized security
14:45:24 <neonfuz2> Customizability*
14:45:40 <neonfuz2> q22 yes
14:45:58 <neonfuz2> They're mostly flac and opus files if that matters
14:46:09 <neonfuz2> Maybe all flax and opus
14:46:52 <neonfuz2> Â¡Finnwww Back From the Dead! Just wondering, why do you want a custom kernel, just for fun or some real reason?
14:47:24 <FinnwwwBackFromt> <neonfuz2 "Â¡Finnwww Back From the Dead! Jus"> For fun and smaller size
14:47:40 <FinnwwwBackFromt> And customization
14:47:54 <neonfuz2> There's nothing stopping you from messing around with graphene and building your own kernel etc if you don't care about the security a ton
14:50:29 <nickcalyx[m]> The source is all there, and the build scripts
14:51:01 <nickcalyx[m]> I think you need 100GB of free disk space
14:51:14 <nickcalyx[m]> To build the whole OS
14:51:35 <nickcalyx[m]> A lot less if you just want to build the kernel
15:00:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> nickcalyx: 75. Take it or leave it
15:00:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> The answer is btrfs with zstd:6
15:04:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can even fit it in 40gb
15:04:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you want
15:04:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> rm -rf .repo after syncing
15:05:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you want to shrink it even further btrfs deduplicator can shrink it a lot
15:07:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now f2fs,
15:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Haven't tried what f2fs has
15:14:50 <nickcalyx[m]> Zfs has dedup too
15:16:05 <hitchhooker[m]> going through grapheneos.org nginx file to learn more securely setting up one and it seems like http and www.grapheneos.org have been rooted to     root /var/empty; . does this help against some attack vector?
15:19:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I think you can use /dev/null too
15:19:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's not an attack vector protection
15:19:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> It just means there's no default site

15:24:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> return 444;
15:24:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> }
15:24:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> In nginx 444 iirc is a special case return code.
15:25:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> It doesn't actually return anything to the browser. It just closes the connection
15:25:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry 403 not 503
16:07:14 <neonfuz2> <nickcalyx[m] "Zfs has dedup too"> Zfs dedupe is apparently really expensive
16:07:26 <neonfuz2> I use zfs with lza compression but that's it
16:09:32 <ruddo[m]> <neonfuz2 "Zfs dedupe is apparently really "> Offtopic.
16:09:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's no lza compression
16:09:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> You either mean lzo or lzma

16:33:38 <georgeaux[m]> Hey. Is everything okay in case of my install?
16:34:23 <sheruleeya[m]> Try running the auditor again and see for yourself.
16:35:13 <sheruleeya[m]> (Also, would be preferred not to use internet before using auditor after flash)
16:36:39 <sheruleeya[m]> Also, scrub that metadata before sending pics here
16:36:41 <georgeaux[m]> Okay. It was my first try with the os. After the next release I will do so. Thank you.
16:37:37 <sheruleeya[m]> Well, yeah, you can definitely try running auditor again, like right now and see if it forms a strong pairing
16:38:38 <sheruleeya[m]> * Well, yeah, you can definitely try running auditor again, like right now and see if it forms a strong pairing.
16:38:38 <sheruleeya[m]> Also a good practice to do it after every release, which could be nearby.
16:40:29 <georgeaux[m]> This time its green, so I guess I'm fine until the next release. Sounds cool, waiting on it.
16:45:43 <demonMachina> missed this part of this conversation, but as long as you're not authenticating with a new device, or "clear Auditee/or pairings", in the future it should be green
16:46:25 <georgeaux[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "Also, scrub that metadata before"> You mean the pictures metadata? Is there a good practise/ app in fdroid? Or you are talking about the identity and boot hash?
16:47:29 <cx2[m]> Scrambled Exif
16:48:14 <sheruleeya[m]> The pic metadata, which can be sadly only scrubbed properly on  exifcleaner or mat2 on desktop OS
16:48:58 <cx2[m]> Scrambled Exif does a pretty solid job.... Mat2 barrows code form scrambled Exif
16:49:26 <sheruleeya[m]> will try it
16:50:11 <georgeaux[m]> <demonMachina "missed this part of this convers"> So its a better to always clean the app data on the auditor device right?
16:51:29 <demonMachina> georgeaux: That's not what those options are there fo
16:51:41 <demonMachina> *for
16:53:26 <demonMachina> If you would like the nice green screen each time, so that there is no mistake, conduct remote attestation, set an interval, and let it run.
16:53:53 <sheruleeya[m]> Just tested it and it doesnt work.
16:54:06 <sheruleeya[m]> The metadata is still there
16:55:12 <neonfuz2> <ruddo[m] "Offtopic."> Its on topic because people were talking about how much space compiling graphene takes on various filesystem configurations
16:55:34 <cx2[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "The metadata is still there "> Scrambled Exif?
16:55:58 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, sadly doesn't work.
16:55:59 <sheruleeya[m]> Won't talk too much about it.
16:56:06 <neonfuz2> <anupritaisno1[m] "There's no lza compression"> Oh yeah I guess I meant lz4, whatever that is
16:56:48 <sheruleeya[m]> Not sure if this will ever be a viable option, but has anybody tried building Vanadium on 4gb ram?
16:57:14 <demonMachina> <sheruleeya[m] > I havent had any issues with it. Have tested it a handful of times.
16:57:38 <demonMachina> re: scramble topic
16:58:38 <sheruleeya[m]> Sharing it on AOSP gallery, and the metadata wont get off
17:05:28 <sheruleeya[m]> <demonMachina "<sheruleeya[m] > I havent had an"> What gallery app do you use btw
17:06:23 <demonMachina> scrambled exif is meant to be used when sending a photo.
17:08:31 <georgeaux[m]> Worked for me too with stock GrapheneOS gallery. Removed maker,model,data,etc.
17:08:56 <sheruleeya[m]> I knew that though, but maybe something is wrong with what I got from fdroid
17:09:09 <demonMachina> quick second.
17:11:25 <sheruleeya[m]> Nvm, restart made it work
17:12:42 <sheruleeya[m]> Any side effects of frequently restarting your phone though, besides the button possibly sinking? Just really liking to utilize the verified boot and encryption before first unlcok

17:13:03 <sheruleeya[m]> (I meant hardware-wise)
17:16:42 <demonMachina> glad you got it working.
17:17:55 <demonMachina> As far as power-cycling the phone, I have no idea. I'm sure theres a metric out there somehwere, but I have never seen one. I can't really see a scenario it would be an issue though.
17:19:05 <demonMachina> maybe limit it to times when it seems sane? e.g. after using public wifi or the like.

18:34:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're worried about an After-First-Unlock exploit, use lockdown mode.

19:56:06 <hiya> Does 8G of RAM on Android consume more battery vs 6 or 4GB? Is it noticeable?
19:58:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> hiya: no
19:58:33 <hiya> In fact it can save battery, correct? Since less swapping or no swap?
19:58:43 <hiya> Less work for CPU to compress/decompress
20:08:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
22:16:55 <rover1[m]> is pop sound when changing from vibrate to ringtone supposed to happen?
22:20:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Probably
23:12:46 <interceptingfist> What search engine does grapheme recommend
23:15:17 <nickcalyx[m]> Bing
23:15:30 <nickcalyx[m]> ðŸ¤£
23:17:22 <glct[m]> Lol what are you asking, the community or the OS?
23:19:55 <Mobius[m]> bing is best indeed
23:28:18 <cdesai> from what I've read bing is pretty good for image search
23:28:28 <cdesai> >_>
