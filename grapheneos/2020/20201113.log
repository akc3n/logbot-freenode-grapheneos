00:12:25 <M473857a[m]> <Dylanger[m] "Lol the Verified Boot hash ðŸ’¯ ma"> In what way does it matter?
00:12:35 <M473857a[m]> And does it ever change?
00:13:14 <Dylanger[m]> It'll change if someone has tried to attack your device
00:27:50 <M473857a[m]> So if it changed that would be proof that my device is indeed compromised?
00:29:28 <Dylanger[m]> Yes, that's what the Attestor is checking/confirming
00:31:50 <Dylanger[m]>  * Yes, that's one of the things the Attestor is checking/confirming
00:37:19 <M473857a[m]> And there is absolutely no other reason it could change?
01:04:10 <strcat> Dylanger[m]: there's a verified boot key which is pinned, and then the verified boot hash which is a unique value per release
01:04:14 <strcat> it's the hash of the entirety of the OS
01:04:24 <strcat> since it's the hash of vbmeta, which has hashes of the rest of the OS, essentially
01:04:38 <strcat> although we still need to disabled the chained system vbmeta feature we don't need
01:04:45 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m]: would be good to get that done, for all devices
01:04:51 <strcat> just disable chained system vbmeta and verify it's disabled
01:23:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat I'm not aware of any way to verify this
01:23:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe I can look through the debug cable after wiping vbmeta_system with fastboot
03:20:55 <cryptag[m]> I'm brand new to grapheneos and everything that goes along with it. Is aurora store usually down for this long?
03:29:30 <louipcm> not usually but you can use custom tokenizer in network settings
09:07:45 <mastercakex[m]> So frustrated. Been using GOS for a year as a daily driver. Dunno why the stability has gone down the drain lately. With each new update I just get less apps working, more lag and device halt
09:08:14 <mastercakex[m]> Soooo dont want to move back to iPhone but need fast acting device for work
09:08:57 <louipcm> you mean major upgrade or?
09:10:05 <mastercakex[m]> I noticed performance drop since we moved to A11
09:11:34 <mastercakex[m]> Maybe just a coincidence, but it hasn't gotten any better ever since. Updating from Aurora is another nightmare and is partly irrelevant to graphene os yet it still makes sense noting that having latest app versions is kinda broken. Update process is barebone manual task
09:13:42 <louipcm> yea there are some A11 issues
09:14:10 <louipcm> aurora domain went down, enable the custom tokenizer in network settings
09:14:54 <louipcm> a grapheneos app repo is one of the things under consideration, but would need more resources and/or volunteers
09:15:03 <louipcm> app store/repo
09:17:09 <louipcm> defending the project against aggressors is also a drain
09:17:26 <louipcm> hopefully that will be resolved sooner than later
09:23:56 <mastercakex[m]> Where do I find that custom tokenizer toggle!??
09:24:08 <louipcm> network settings
09:24:13 <mastercakex[m]> Got it
09:24:15 <louipcm> of aurora store
09:24:29 <louipcm> in the app
09:29:18 <alexm[m]> I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but yesterday I set up my own  DNS-over-TLS server with a couple of blocklists activated. What I noticed is that when I enabled Private DNS in GrapheneOS it sends a couple queries to *-dnsotls-ds.metric.gstatic.com.
09:30:06 <alexm[m]> If I block DNS queries to those domains, I get 'Private DNS Server cannot be accessed.'.
09:30:29 <alexm[m]> Is there any way to disable this behaviour or change the domain?
10:37:12 <belay_that_order> hello, any ideas on unlocking the botloader without using fastboot on pixlel 3a?

13:16:06 <fj3vrhar5f[m]> Should I wait for Graphene to support Pixel 5 (w/ 5G) or buy the Pixel 4a (w/ 4G) now?
13:52:08 <nscnt> fj3vrhar5f[m]: Now: Pixel 4a (*NOT* 5G)
13:54:17 <nscnt> That's what currently recommended
13:55:27 <nscnt> what *is
13:59:36 <nscnt> It's unknown when the Pixel 5 will be supported. Someone would need to work for it. Pixel 4a is freshly supported
14:24:48 <Volkoz[m]> whoops i got kicked for being idle lol
14:24:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Volkoz welcome back
14:24:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is a 30-day period of idle before you are kicked btw
14:24:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> * There is a 30-day period of idle time allowed before you are kicked btw

19:36:56 <fred`>  /topic
20:03:21 <fred`> recently recieved a pixel 4a and installed the lastest stable-graphenos + relocked the bootloader afterwards. is it normal, that the phone shows this message before booting:
20:03:29 <fred`> Your Device is loading a different operating system. Visit this link on another device: g.co/ABH
20:03:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
20:04:01 <fred`> thx
20:04:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Realize that you are loading a different operating system
20:05:23 <fred`> before i only saw these 'early interaction' with unlocked bootloaders and just wanted to be sure
20:08:05 <TheJollyRoger> fred`: this is perfectly normal and expected behaviour. This simply means "This operating system wasn't signed by Google, but it was signed and it is being verified as normal."
20:09:29 <TheJollyRoger> If it turns orange and you get this ominous "Software integrity is not guaranteed!" warning that you should worry, but otherwise the yellow text is normal and expected. If it wasn't there, then that means you're loading Google's operating system.
20:09:48 <TheJollyRoger> *warning, then you should worry
20:13:59 <fred`> thank you for clarification
20:30:25 <fred`> whats the trick to remove the default background after installation, since i want 'just black'
20:32:04 <fred`> there are just livepics or galery, but no 'single colors' available
20:32:32 <strcat[m]> set a black image
20:33:37 <fred`> oh - ok :)
20:35:36 <mrxx_0[m]> any idea why when extracting vendor files my download speed is incredibly slow ? 120k instead of 22Mo
20:35:36 <mrxx_0[m]> Doing a simple curl with the same url gets me the right speed
20:53:36 <prestocaso[m]> I don't know if this will prove useful  but I was able to repeatedly install graphene on a pixel 4a using https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/device-flasher
20:54:10 <prestocaso[m]> I tested it multiple times and it seemed to work flawlessly
20:57:56 <prestocaso[m]> I originally saw it recommended by a user for calyx and thought I'd try it for grapheme and it worked I was even able to put most recent pixel ROM back on it
20:58:19 <prestocaso[m]> *Graphene
20:59:21 <strcat[m]> our official installation instructions work well already
20:59:45 <strcat[m]> and don't require trusting additional parties
21:01:59 <strcat[m]> we're not going to be using or recommending that tool
21:02:15 <strcat[m]> there are plans to implement a WebUSB-based installer for people that aren't going to be using signify anyway
21:02:58 <prestocaso[m]> I understand, I just wanted to share my discovery in case the information was useful
21:05:16 <strcat[m]> one of the people involved early in the development of that tool stole code from me and put fraudulent copyright notices on it
21:05:31 <strcat[m]> we won't be using any of their code and I don't recommend touching anything they were involved with, they may have done something sketchy
21:07:05 <prestocaso[m]> Ah sorry I've suggested it then. I wasn't aware
21:10:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> guys help is needed
21:10:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> we have a group to defend grapheneos against people who are attacking the project
21:10:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> i have asked several times
21:10:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> please
21:10:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> if you can help us, pm me
21:11:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> this is like the 5th time i'm asking this here
21:11:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> and nobody steps up
21:11:33 <louipcm> whats the group
21:11:37 <prestocaso[m]> It looks like the person also may be  involved in the development of calyx
21:12:34 <strcat[m]> prestocaso: no, they aren't
21:12:53 <strcat[m]> don't know why you're making bad assumptions and now spreading misinformation here
21:13:01 <strcat[m]> did I say a username of who I was talking about? no
21:13:39 <strcat[m]> so I'm not sure how you picked a specific person to assume I was talking about
21:13:53 <strcat[m]> when multiple people were involved in developing that
21:14:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> guilty conscience
21:14:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> lol
21:15:16 <prestocaso[m]> The device flasher is really put together by one guy. That was the basis of my assumption
21:15:30 <strcat[m]> that's not what the commit history shows
21:15:43 <strcat[m]> > one of the people involved early in the development of that tool stole code from me and put fraudulent copyright notices on it
21:15:45 <strcat[m]> this is what I said
21:16:32 <strcat[m]> please don't misrepresent what I say and spread seriously harmful misinformation based on illogical assumptions
21:17:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> guys please message me to be able to defend grapheneos from people actively trying to attack it
21:18:36 <prestocaso[m]> Sorry I only scrolled back a couple months in the commit history. And you did say it was early in the development cycle.
21:23:55 <prestocaso[m]> strcat: my intention wasn't to be combative or spread misinformation. Your comment about the history of the project piqued my curiosity, that was all.
21:27:15 <prestocaso[m]> strcat: that's happened on multiple occasions where I feel like I put my foot in my mouth in reference to something your working on
21:33:23 <seashield[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "and nobody steps up"> I'd be happy to help, but I'd probably end up doing more harm than good so I donate instead.
22:11:47 <duggalsu[m]> My device failed to provide remote attestation. What shall I do
22:13:02 <duggalsu[m]> I tried submitting sample data from auditor but there was no notification and now the option is grayed out
22:13:56 <strcat[m]> sounds like the device doesn't have working internet access
22:14:17 <strcat[m]> no reason to submit sample data for a device that's already supported unless a developer specifically requests it
22:15:35 <duggalsu[m]> Internet has been giving issues since a few days but the auditor tries submitting data every 4 hours so it should have worked at least once?
22:16:04 <strcat[m]> doesn't sound like your internet is working at all for connecting to attestation.app
22:16:24 <strcat[m]> it will try immediately after getting a working connection not just at the configured rate, if the previous attempts failed
22:16:41 <strcat[m]> unless it is repeatedly failing so the attempts get throttled
22:16:44 <strcat[m]> which is probably happening
22:16:54 <strcat[m]> you don't have working internet, you'll need to fix that so it can reach the server
22:17:03 <duggalsu[m]> Hmm, could it be a website blocking from the ISP?
22:17:11 <strcat[m]> could be
22:17:21 <strcat[m]> or something you configured locally
22:17:35 <strcat[m]> seems quite strange for an ISP to block attestation.app
22:19:35 <duggalsu[m]> My service provider has been upgrading there systems and changed my router too some time back... will check if that may be the issue.  Thanks!
22:22:12 <strcat[m]> you could try loading attestation.app in a browser but it doesn't imply that it works from the app
22:22:15 <strcat[m]> since it's not entirely the samer
22:22:18 <strcat[m]>  * since it's not entirely the same
22:23:38 <golli[m]1> So what's the difference for the Pixel 5 boot image format and the one used in previous Pixel models?
22:29:25 <duggalsu[m]> It does open in the browser
22:30:58 <strcat[m]> duggalsu: do you have some kind of weird TLS interception configured or anything like that
22:36:36 <duggalsu[m]> Ah, it worked!  Thanks.  I was testing a VPN and later enabled trackercontrol which was working fine until the last OS update on pixel 2. Worked as soon as I disabled trackercontrol, had totally forgotten about it
22:38:29 <duggalsu[m]> Possibly some issue with trackercontrol with last OS update?
22:38:58 <strcat[m]> doubt there is any problem caused by the OS updates
22:39:11 <strcat[m]> probably just a broken VPN app
22:39:37 <strcat[m]> we've been enhancing the security of our services, etc.
22:40:06 <strcat[m]> we moved https://attestation.app/ to a new server a few days ago
22:40:12 <strcat[m]> it's working fine and shouldn't be causing any problems
22:40:32 <strcat[m]> but it has a new IP, new TLS key, new certificate based on that key, updated DANE TLS pinning
22:40:33 <strcat[m]> etc
22:42:13 <duggalsu[m]> Yes, I figured app issue,  thanks
