13:25:32 <somenerd[m]> oh he mistook your message as a reply
13:25:53 <webweb> ah lol sorry
13:26:04 <webweb> my reading comprehension failed miserably there
13:26:42 <webweb> anyways whenever i try to call someone, it immediately hangs up. whenever someone tries to call me, i don't get any notification of it, and on the other side they get a busy message
13:26:57 <strcat[m]> sounds like a carrier problem
13:27:07 <strcat[m]> have you enabled LTE only without having VoLTE support? that's one possibility
13:27:15 <strcat[m]> it's some kind of carrier issue though
13:27:36 <webweb> i remember disabling 2g and 3g, by setting it to LTE onyl
13:27:38 <webweb> only*
13:27:44 <webweb> can this be the problem?
13:28:23 <strcat[m]> webweb: yes, you probably don't have working VoLTE on your carrier
13:28:24 <strcat[m]> so set it back to LTE instead of LTE only
13:28:43 <strcat[m]> if you don't have working VoLTE, traditional calls use 3g
13:28:55 <strcat[m]>  * if you don't have working VoLTE, traditional calls use 3g/2g

13:29:19 <telum[m]1> <Lotta[m] "If they have no idea for seconda"> Not to bring all this back, but it raised an interesting technical question for me. Would it be possible to create hidden profiles (or folders within a profile) like Veracrypt does on computers? Not sure how mobile devices compare.
13:30:18 <telum[m]1> In the future
13:31:13 <duggalsu[m]> strcat the app doesn't go past the start activity where it tries to scan directories, I'll debug and try to fix,  good to know its not a security issue.  Thanks!
13:31:36 <strcat[m]> telum: the way that works is not actually deniable once you've decrypted the non-hidden ones
13:34:27 <telum[m]1> <strcat[m] "telum: the way that works is not"> As in the existence of encryption and the program, if I understand it correctly? The hidden part wouldn't be visible on a computer iirc, but could be guessed at because of the other factors?
13:34:38 <strcat[m]> it is visible
13:34:54 <telum[m]1> I see
13:35:08 <strcat[m]> they can see that there's a storage area with encrypted data (high entropy random data) that you have not decrypted
13:35:13 <strcat[m]> what's deniable about that?
13:35:35 <strcat[m]> they can see that you've given them what they needed to decrypt 95% of the storage and that there's an area at the end which you have not decrypted
13:35:40 <strcat[m]> it's not deniable in reality
13:36:11 <strcat[m]> we won't implement a feature like that
13:36:49 <telum[m]1> Fair enough. I suppose it is not useful when there is someone competent looking.
13:36:49 <telum[m]1> Understood, thanks for the break down
13:37:16 <strcat[m]> also the presence of that feature will be known
13:37:36 <strcat[m]> so how would you propose implementing it when the partitioning will be standard for all users?
13:37:54 <strcat[m]> make an extra partition for all users, and it's optional if you use it?
13:38:11 <strcat[m]> doesn't really make sense just make extra profiles
13:38:26 <strcat[m]> it's a lot more plausible that a profile belongs to someone else and you don't have the passphrase
13:38:53 <somenerd[m]> do profiles work like VMs (in that they separate malware from the system)
13:38:58 <somenerd[m]>  * do profiles work like VMs (in that they separate malware from the system)?
13:39:09 <strcat[m]> the premise of your question is flawed
13:39:15 <strcat[m]> there's an app sandbox regardless
13:39:19 <strcat[m]> across profiles or not
13:39:52 <strcat[m]> profiles are separate isolated workspaces without data sharing or app communication being possible across them
13:41:37 <strcat[m]> same app sandbox as always
13:43:33 <somenerd[m]> Thanks for the clarification!
13:44:12 <somenerd[m]> I think that most GrapheneOS users (and potential ones) should join this room to be honest.
13:44:57 <strcat[m]> the OS just has separate workspaces for app communication for each profile, and separate profile data (for example when an app requests access to file, contacts, etc.)
13:45:31 <strcat[m]> it doesn't add more sandboxing, there's always a strong OS sandbox
13:46:38 <strcat[m]> so you can think of a profile as a home directory + other profile data like contacts (and apps cannot access any of that data without your permission) + a separate installation of each app + a workspace where apps can communicate within it
13:46:45 <roqstr> hey folks, quick question again: does the transition from experimental to beta/stable release just get pushed via OTA updates or do I have to reflash the phone one the latter are available? (pixel 4a)
13:47:21 <strcat[m]> the stable and beta channels are just update channels, it's the same OS
13:47:43 <strcat[m]> you can switch which channel you receive updates from at any time (it won't change the OS version, just where you get future updates)
13:47:55 <strcat[m]> release channels are explained on the site
13:48:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#about-the-releases
13:48:05 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#updates
13:48:19 <strcat[m]> > Releases are tested by the developers and are then pushed out via the Beta channel. The release is then pushed out via the Stable channel after being tested by some users using the Beta channel. In some cases, problems are caught during Beta channel testing and a new release is made via the Beta channel to replace the aborted one. In general, it's not possible to downgrade unless a downgrade update package is
13:48:19 <strcat[m]> generated, so use the Stable channel if you cannot tolerate dealing with temporary issues while a new release for the Beta channel is being created.
13:48:52 <strcat[m]> roqstr: 4a support is experimental, that's not related to release channels
13:49:04 <strcat[m]> 4a support via the Stable channel is still experimental
13:50:22 <roqstr> but when it loses the status experimental, will those with the experimental builds be provided with updates to migrate to the stable version
13:51:49 <pasta04[m]> I think you'll have to reflash
13:52:19 <roqstr> alright, thank  you!
13:54:37 <strcat[m]> no
13:54:39 <strcat[m]> you won't have to reflash
13:54:47 <strcat[m]> experimental means it's experimental, that's it
13:54:51 <strcat[m]> it's not a different OS
13:55:30 <strcat[m]> the official releases from https://grapheneos.org/releases are official releases, that are in an early state and considered experimental
13:55:36 <strcat[m]> I don't think there's anything complicated about it
13:56:08 <strcat[m]> since they're experimental, the headers were set to say "experimental" which will be removed from those headers when everything is working and it is more tested
13:56:36 <pasta04[m]> sorry then, my bad!
13:59:42 <roqstr> ah even better! Then I can cautiously set up the phone already! thanks a lot!
14:00:06 <webweb>  pasta04[m]: strcat[m] is strict but they are very knowledgeable
14:00:42 <webweb> when i'm wrong about something i am enlightened right away
14:00:48 <webweb> and i think that's fair
14:01:04 <webweb> so no need to apologize! we are all learning together :-)
14:01:15 <pasta04[m]> <webweb " pasta04: strcat[m] is strict bu"> no question about that! I've been trying to keep up with the thread, but mostly I'm just scratching my head
14:01:32 <pasta04[m]> <webweb "so no need to apologize! we are "> that is indeed completely fair, thanks! :)
14:02:47 <webweb> hahah i'm also scratching my head. most of the stuff discussed in here is very inspiring, but goes over my head the majority of the time
14:03:10 <somenerd[m]> yeah maybe re-read?
14:03:12 <somenerd[m]> that helps
14:03:15 <somenerd[m]> (for me)
14:04:18 <webweb> it helps sometimes, but i'm not so knowledgeable in the tech that is described on here. i'd have to read a lot to know the terms used and the concepts discussed
14:04:38 <somenerd[m]> me neither (lol)
14:05:41 <pasta04[m]> same here, if I'm not sure about the concepts, rereading doesn't always help
14:05:56 <pasta04[m]> but still, it's incredibly interesting to read
14:06:04 <BenchTed[m]> But you defo made a good decision to install graphene
14:06:38 <webweb> yeah! i was just looking for a way to get rid of google on my old pixel (1st gen) when i was introduced to graphene. when my pixel failed, i got the pixel 3a, and i have been very satisfied with the amazing engineering that has gone into this project
14:07:20 <BenchTed[m]> Now all that's left is to convince your family and friends 😀
14:10:59 <webweb> true, though i'm surrounded by iphones so that's a tough transition for most people
14:11:50 <somenerd[m]> yeah
14:13:14 <res4[m]> At least you're surrounded by the second best option.
14:13:32 <webweb> yeah good point!
14:13:33 <somenerd[m]> yeah
14:14:08 <somenerd[m]> I think CalyxOS is the third best option? Not sure though.
14:15:13 <Lotta[m]> So far yes
14:15:36 <somenerd[m]> I hope that Graphene gets the hardening described in the roadmap
14:16:09 <somenerd[m]> would make it (imo) a lot better than iPhones (rather than a small margin)
14:16:19 <webweb> interesting! where can i find the roadmap?
14:16:28 <somenerd[m]> on the website
14:16:35 <webweb> thanks!
14:16:44 <webweb> i've heard some praise for it but have mot checked out calyx for myself btw
14:16:49 <webweb> not*
14:18:05 <Lotta[m]> That's alright. If there is no desired app compatibility that's not working in GrapheneOS, there is not much reason to move. It's still a good project with different target audiencr
14:18:13 <BenchTed[m]> I'd say any open source ROMs without gapps is better than any iPhone
14:18:53 <Lotta[m]> Something like GrapheneOS > iOS >>> stock Android?
14:19:14 <Lotta[m]> <BenchTed[m] "I'd say any open source ROMs wit"> Depends on what aspect is it better
14:19:30 <BenchTed[m]> Using iPhone rather than pixel is just entrusting your entire  public data in other company
14:19:57 <Lotta[m]> Technically you still trust the hardware
14:21:20 <vavava[m]> Hello guys, i was wondering : how do you test your builds for GrapheneOS (i was thinking about helping on the project) ? Real devices ? Or emulator is working also ?
14:22:11 <Lotta[m]> <vavava[m] "Hello guys, i was wondering : ho"> Depends. Emulator is the way for those who don't have extra phones, phones otherwise
14:23:22 <BenchTed[m]> You trust software than access hardware and since iPhone os is not open source how can you be what is really happening behind the scenes
14:23:38 <BenchTed[m]> *then
14:24:17 <BenchTed[m]> * You trust software then access hardware and since iPhone os is not open source how can you be sure what is really happening behind the scenes
14:25:18 <BenchTed[m]> In open source project when leak is exposed it weights on public trust of entire system
14:25:35 <BenchTed[m]> Therefore less chance of doing something shady
14:26:02 <res4[m]> <BenchTed[m] "I'd say any open source ROMs wit"> If your device isn't secure, your privacy is fundamentally compromised. I'd never recommend just any device as long as it doesn't have Google. iOS devices can be configured to make them quite good in terms of privacy, and as far as we know, those toggles actually work. A certain balance between security and privacy is preferable over sacrificing vital security.
14:27:42 <BenchTed[m]> The question remains whether do you know really to what extend your private data is sacrificed
14:28:28 <BenchTed[m]> Let's say how can you be sure your mic is not switch on without you being notified
14:29:36 <res4[m]> Of course that question remains to some extent, that's why GrapheneOS is (in my opinion) the best option.
14:30:02 <BenchTed[m]> That is what I agree with you entirely my friend
14:32:58 <res4[m]> It's just that trusting a device and an OS, in which gaining access to said microphone is trivial, does not make much sense to me. No matter how open source the code is, or how noble the intent was. Wouldn't make me any more comfortable to trust my phone.
14:34:16 <res4[m]> Strong security is very important which is why it's also the foundation for GrapheneOS.
14:38:32 <Lotta[m]> <BenchTed[m] "Therefore less chance of doing s"> Does not mean it has zero chance to be so, or having vulnerabilities left unpatched due to different goals and cultures of its developers (say, performance over security, see: Linux (Desktop especially))
14:39:16 <Lotta[m]> <res4[m] "It's just that trusting a device"> Well, if they can easily get to access the microphone without permission, that's a huge problem
14:39:49 <Lotta[m]> Imagine AOSP OS, being used by various OEM, has a bypassable permission model (say, on microphone)
14:39:58 <Lotta[m]> Will that news not be big and pop?
14:40:20 <BenchTed[m]> Well gaining mic access was the reason that pushed me to installing custom ROM as I was wasn't able to stop stock ROM listeninong to me and keep displaying me ads on Facebook so I'd say it huge security violation
14:40:55 <Lotta[m]> <BenchTed[m] "Well gaining mic access was the "> ads based on behavior through algorithms may seem to be listening too
14:41:22 <Lotta[m]> Like browsing habits, what app you use, for how long, do you charge your phone
14:41:27 <BenchTed[m]> Problem is there were some keywords I used and never searched for
14:41:40 <Lotta[m]> See: PrivacyBreacher on what can be accessed without any permission
14:41:46 <Lotta[m]> <BenchTed[m] "Problem is there were some keywo"> Sensors may be a culprit there
14:41:55 <Lotta[m]> sensors need no permission
14:42:49 <BenchTed[m]> OK any idea how to stop apps accessing sensors on custom rom
14:43:04 <BenchTed[m]> Or stock rom
14:43:07 <Lotta[m]> <BenchTed[m] "OK any idea how to stop apps acc"> Use GrapheneOS
14:43:23 <BenchTed[m]> 😀👍
14:43:23 <Lotta[m]> Oh, developer options, but not ideal.
14:45:21 <BenchTed[m]> Just curious, which option would that be
14:45:56 <BenchTed[m]> Defo not user friendly solution
14:46:07 <Lotta[m]> Think it something about developer tiles and sensors off
14:46:23 <Lotta[m]> <BenchTed[m] "Defo not user friendly solution "> True, as it turns off even microphone and camera
14:46:33 <Lotta[m]> GrapheneOS uses a finer grained other sensor permissions
14:46:43 <Lotta[m]> Without having to open developer options
14:47:26 <BenchTed[m]> Awesome
14:48:50 <BenchTed[m]> Also if you think about mic data being leaked. What is the point on encrypting your device when all your most private data is already widely accessible by huge corporations
14:48:52 <res4[m]> <Lotta[m] "Well, if they can easily get to "> Obviously that's a huge deal. I'm not saying that's the case with most custom ROMs, I was illustrating the point of why open source shouldn't make anyone feel inherently safer than a proprietary operating system with strong security and reasonably trustworthy respect for privacy.

14:52:30 <Lotta[m]> Anyways, looking at the changelogs themselves of other available OS (wish could audit them one time), without the worry for app compatibility, only GrapheneOS and iOS tops, and they are quite neck to neck on advantages and disadvantages

15:02:48 <BenchTed[m]> Problem is there are too many ways one app can gain access to revoked permissions for anyone to build tools of proper logging.

15:33:09 <nomad_jack[m]> Hello. Is it okay to use this chat for a troubleshooting issue? It has to do with USB to other displays. File transfers, or anything needing the USB to an alternate device.
15:35:28 <webweb> i think as long as it is relevant to grapheneos it should be fine. if not you can ask that some of the people here join you in the off topic chat to discuss further :-)
15:35:53 <nomad_jack[m]> Cool. Thank you : )
15:36:22 <webweb> no problem!

15:40:29 <strcat[m]> jpds: that's to automatically remove permissions if the app isn't used, not if the permissions aren't used
15:42:54 <Lotta[m]> Imagined being locked down in a sucky kernel, with sucky spyware OS
15:43:30 <Lotta[m]> Wait why did it get sent here
15:44:12 <dazinism> BenchTed: the permission system has improved a fair bit over the last few years. Also general system security. Best not to let apps you don't trust have access to data you want to protect.

15:45:05 <strcat[m]> > output the screen to another device (TV or Monitor)
15:45:09 <nomad_jack[m]> I *can't* use it to output*  sorry. typo
15:45:17 <strcat[m]> that's not supported on any of the officially supported devices ATM
15:45:34 <strcat[m]> the rest should work fine
15:45:41 <nomad_jack[m]> I see.
15:45:41 <nomad_jack[m]> What about file transfer?
15:45:58 <nomad_jack[m]> It doesn't on mine currently. it still acts as a charger for whatever device.
15:45:59 <strcat[m]> should all work fine other than display output
15:46:07 <webweb> does your pixel attempt to say charge your computer when transferring files?
15:46:13 <strcat[m]> there isn't support for analog audio output (only digital)
15:46:19 <strcat[m]> and there isn't support for display output
15:46:35 <nomad_jack[m]> Yes. And when I try and switch the charge bar it just hangs.
15:46:35 <dazinism> Yeah I've found stuff works via usb C
15:46:56 <strcat[m]> it may be possible to add support for display output per device but it's a very low priority for us
15:47:07 <nomad_jack[m]> On all things I used USB-C but on my PC I have to use a usb-c to A
15:47:07 <strcat[m]> nomad_jack: sounds like a hardware issue
15:47:38 <strcat[m]> could be the cable, not necessarily the phone
15:47:57 <nomad_jack[m]> I've tried multiple ports and cables.
15:48:08 <nomad_jack[m]> Been working on this for 3 months so haha.
15:48:13 <Lotta[m]> Mine was double the price
15:48:21 <Lotta[m]> 250
15:48:45 <strcat[m]> nomad_jack: almost certainly faulty phone hardware then
15:48:56 <strcat[m]> unless you changed USB settings in developer options or something like that
15:49:27 <nomad_jack[m]> I did when it didn't work. I doubt its hardware as the phone was working fine prior.
15:49:39 <webweb> hmm. on my pixel 3a, file transfer from my windows 10 computer via usb 2.0 (usb-a to usb-c cable) works fine once i switch from "no data transfer" (i.e. charge the phone) to "file transfer"
15:50:09 <webweb> oh sorry i meant usb 3.1
15:52:10 <dazinism> I've been using usb keyboard and mouse (via a usb hub) and usb flash storage without issues
15:53:40 <dazinism> Should try a usb portable external hard drive in the hub as the hub has power in via usb C
15:54:15 <strcat[m]> nomad_jack: if you've changed developer options, that's probably the cause
15:54:39 <strcat[m]> start by disabling developer options (although that doesn't reset everything)
16:01:22 <dazinism> BenchTed: Regarding the paper you linked. Apps get access to the data you give them. They can share data with apps in the same user profile.
16:02:08 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/inter-app-comms
16:02:35 <dazinism> Also this

16:03:22 <Yo> I'm impressed with Graphene OS and want to contribute to a regular donation. My questions are: (1) is GitHub sponsorship the best place to do this (as opposed to PayPal donations) and (2) is "the stinger" really the lead developer (as opposed to an impostor).
16:04:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> Could you cast the Pixel screen to a portable monitor and use a keyboard/mouse with a USB hub to get a Graphene OS desktop?
16:05:25 <dazinism> Yo: yes the stinger is the lead dev and either of those payment methods is good.
16:06:04 <spathionema[m]> good morning comrades
16:07:44 <Yo> Thanks. Looking at the GitHub page, I'm amazed that $5k/month goal is so far off. Anyway, happy to play my part.
16:09:53 <webweb> hello comrade!
16:10:57 <Lotta[m]> nitter.net/DanielMicay might help answer that question
16:12:03 <spathionema[m]> how secure is the experimental 4a?
16:34:19 <dazinism> hypokeimenon: not heard of anyone casting, but can use a displaylink monitor like this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2iw4YJpiBVo
17:00:23 <leonid> Hello.
17:01:56 <leonid> Pff, I was about to ask the dreaded 4a question, and then I checked the releases.
17:02:01 <leonid> I'll flash that today
17:03:30 <alex[m]1> Ha! If you didn't mention it, I wouldn't know.
17:04:03 <alex[m]1> I received my 4a last Thursday.
17:24:12 <fourstepper> Hi, is there a way to use text to speech without Google services?
17:26:10 <fourstepper> * Hi, is there a way to use text to speech without Google services - for example in OsmAnd
17:28:09 <dazinism> fourstepper: recently added to fdroid
17:28:17 <dazinism> RHVoice - a free and open source speech synthesize (TTS engine with extended languages support (incl. Russian)) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android
17:28:38 <dazinism> Havent tried it, but imagine it will work
17:29:58 <dazinism> Alternatively in osmand can also download recorded prompts
17:30:46 <dazinism> In settings > download maps, at the bottom
17:33:12 <dazinism> Have to enable that in your navigation settings
17:33:39 <dazinism> In osmand, always takes me a while to find where that is....
17:37:23 <fourstepper> dazinism the rhvoice seems to work, thanks a lot
17:39:24 <fourstepper> Osmand settings are like the most daunting thing ever :D
17:41:25 <dazinism> Yeah, I somehow managed to set up an osmand profile with an overlay of googlemaps traffic levels
17:44:09 <dazinism> Which can be handy for quickly checking traffic. Although I'm not sure if the data I'm pulling from them for that updates as quickly as when viewing maps.google.com
17:50:18 <joltman[m]> The reason that 4a got released is because of Murphy's Law. I decided not to pull the trigger on a 4a because of the ambiguity over GrapheneOS support and got a 3XL instead.
17:50:57 <joltman[m]> Not that 4a is supported yet, but there are at least decent builds available for it.
17:56:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <joltman[m] "Not that 4a is supported yet, bu"> It is, we also have a guy who can get auditor support in before the next security patch (hopefully)
18:50:03 <devnull[m]2> Hi. I've a quick question. I previously read that in the new update (I assume the one that just came out) always on display will be fixed / implemented. I just updated my P4XL and I'm unable to find it.
18:56:08 <raghu[m]> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
18:56:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> <devnull[m]2 "Hi. I've a quick question. I pre"> Where?
18:56:09 <raghu[m]> This app "simulates" the Google Play Services that the Google Camera app (Gcam) requires, allowing the camera app to be used on devices without Google Play Services
18:56:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Where is this written?
20:13:36 <aut0> Hi all, is someone using pixel 4a with graphene as a daily driver?
20:14:01 <aut0> Wondering if it's stable enough
20:15:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's stable
20:15:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just that 1 important feature is missing right now
20:16:03 <aut0> What is that?
20:16:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Auditor support
20:20:06 <aut0> Okay. But I could use it without auditor until it is available right?
21:14:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW guys
21:14:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please stop messaging me, then leaving the chat and then using a new chat after a few days to message me again
21:15:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just use 1 chat while messaging me. There's a huge mess in my PMs right now
21:16:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also stop deleting messages you send me. This is getting out of hand and then some of you also expect me to remember exactly who you are and what the problem was
21:19:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Everyday I'll at least have 3-4 people asking me for help in PMs. I cannot remember who you are out of all the people who messaged me
22:18:28 <AppAraat[m]> Hi, so I think I'm finally getting the Pixel 3a tomorrow. I'm getting it used though, so if you have any tips for me about testing it, then please do share.
22:41:23 <BenchTed[m]> <AppAraat[m] "Hi, so I think I'm finally getti"> What made you switch to graphene
23:00:37 <AppAraat[m]> BenchTed: I think it was because (CopperheadOS at that time) was widely regarded as the most secure ROM, but I can't remember the exact details because it was a couple of years ago.
