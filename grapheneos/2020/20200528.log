00:02:35 <inquiree> Ran into the same issue with https://bitcoin.org/en/wallets/mobile/android/bitcoinwallet/
00:03:31 <inquiree> Settings completely froze with uninstallation. Had to resort to removing it via adb
00:05:03 <inquiree> Only ran into that issue with 2 apps. https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.schildbach.wallet/ is one, can't remember the other
00:05:57 <inquiree> I tried the f-droid build of bitcoin wallet*
00:14:09 <travankor> is CalyxOS a fork of grapheneos?
00:14:38 <cdesai> no, it's based directly off AOSP
00:14:57 <cdesai> we do share some code though, such as the OTA updater, and are both part of AOSP Alliance
00:15:53 <travankor> so AOSP bundled with some apps
00:16:04 <travankor> and only for pixels?
00:17:09 <cdesai> apps, features, things like microg. All current Pixels, and Mi A2. We have our own channel, that'd be better suited for futher discussion.
00:18:11 <travankor> all right, thanks
00:58:27 <travankor> do you guys have any "must have" google play apks?
00:58:35 <travankor> like Google camera
01:06:43 <travankor> `/whois
01:34:00 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_travankor:matrix.org no
01:34:13 <cn3m[m]> that's why I left an iPhone I fully degoogled my life
01:34:25 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't touch any Android if that wasn't the case
01:46:56 <travankor> cn3m[m]: you degoogled by getting rid of apple? :p
01:48:21 <travankor> and i agree with you, but the foss camera apps don't work as well on the A-series
01:48:21 <travankor> kind of sucks, if you underutilizing your hardware
01:48:52 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_travankor:matrix.org no I degoogled by switching to Apple
01:48:53 <cn3m[m]> which opens the door to coming back to Android
01:49:46 <cn3m[m]> Apple is much easier to get out by buying stuff. Their software ecosystem isn't there
01:50:53 <travankor> i have an older iphone rn
01:51:08 <travankor> the base apps like maps and camera work well
01:52:45 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_travankor:matrix.org that's by far the best option beside anything other than an AOSP alliance ROM
01:54:23 <travankor> right, i'm trying to see how feasible it is to "upgrade" to graphene
01:57:27 <travankor> foss apps are pretty nice, but seems like proprietary android apps are a huge mess
02:08:09 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_travankor:matrix.org I would search the subreddit for iOS
02:08:10 <cn3m[m]> there's a lot of information
02:08:33 <cn3m[m]> both have strengths and weaknesses as they are excellent options
03:39:41 <chickensupreme[m> anyone able to help me out with some app development? i thought i'd take a crack at some of the pdfviewer issues since the OS stuff is well beyond my skill level but i haven't done any development in years so i'm pretty rusty
03:40:12 <TheJollyRoger> Hi hi chickensupreme[m! I unfortunately don't know anything about app development, but I'll be cheering you all the way!
03:40:22 <chickensupreme[m> i'm running linux, i installed android studio and the android sdk (via android studio), i cloned the pdfviewer source off git and loaded it into android studio
03:40:56 <chickensupreme[m> i hooked my phone up and enabled usb debugging and was able to build and start debugging the app (no changes to the source yet) but it crashes on startup with this
03:41:11 <chickensupreme[m> java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{org.grapheneos.pdfviewer.debug/org.grapheneos.pdfviewer.PdfViewer}: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'java.lang.String android.net.Uri.getScheme()' on a null object reference
03:42:39 <chickensupreme[m> it's crashing at the following line: setContentView(R.layout.webview);
03:43:44 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. I don't know what's going on, but fingers crossed someone else here might be able to answer...?
03:43:47 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry.
03:44:11 <chickensupreme[m> and if i have it break on crash it's due to a ClassNotFound exception on "android.widget.ViewStub"
03:44:24 <chickensupreme[m> i'll keep poking at it, just thought i'd ask if someone knew
03:44:25 <chickensupreme[m> thanks :)
03:45:17 <TheJollyRoger> Arr! I hope someone else here may know!
03:47:24 <TheJollyRoger> Best of luck!

07:27:31 <blacklight447[m]> so folks, what do you think is worse for security: rooting your phone, but having a locked bootloader, or have non rooted phone, with an unlocked bootloader
07:43:30 <JTL> If the bootloader is unlocked it would probably be trivial me for to inject root binaries into it
07:47:45 * JTL offers blacklight an old rooted LG phone with circumvented bootlodaer (exploit) as a gag gift
07:49:40 <cn3m[m]>  @blacklight447:privacytools.io root with a locked bootloader doesn't do anything
07:49:41 <cn3m[m]> no root unlocked bootloader is the most secure
07:49:56 <cn3m[m]> out of that joke system
08:08:11 <joeri_poeri[m]1> just discovered that the alarm won't go off if your phone is in battery saving mode. might be something to consider when using the alarms on your phone people
08:15:54 <cg_droid> Yes, in my Pixel 3a the alarm doesn't sound if I use the Battery saving mode. Have you tried with a different app?
08:16:09 <cg_droid> Thanks for noting this!
08:16:49 <cg_droid> I'll try with Simple Clock
08:21:55 <kernelpaniker[m]> It works with simple click in battery saving mode
08:22:05 <kernelpaniker[m]> * It works with simple clock in battery saving mode
08:23:21 <virgin_eagle[m]> > so folks, what do you think is worse for security: rooting your phone, but having a locked bootloader, or have non rooted phone, with an unlocked bootloader
08:23:22 <virgin_eagle[m]> Nonrooted with unlocked bl
08:23:52 <cg_droid> Well, opening Simple Clock and setting the alarm I receive a warning about the Battery saving mode!
08:24:38 <cg_droid> kernelpaniker[m], not always... only if the screen seems to be on
08:24:47 <cg_droid> I'm testing
08:29:52 <cg_droid> Yes, it works with the app opened, I'll try with the app closed, because it didn't sound before...
08:38:29 <cg_droid> With the app closed it doesn't sound, Ii think it's something normal in Battery saving mode
08:38:46 <cg_droid> Final test with the app opened and the screen off
08:41:03 <stuux[m]>     On stock it is working with battery saving mode and the app closed
08:42:57 <cg_droid> stuux[m], I'll try again. I think it's not stable, sometimes it sounds and sometimes doesn't
08:43:28 <cg_droid> Now it worked 1 minute later with Simple Clock, I'll try with Clock
08:47:09 <cg_droid> No, with Clock with the app closed and screen off doesn't work in my Pixel 3a
08:47:35 <cg_droid> Well, I must remember to not use the battery saving mode if I have an alarm
09:04:03 <kernelpaniker[m]> Is it possible it will be fixed in the next patch?
09:05:04 <kernelpaniker[m]> I'm forced to use battery saver as my pixel 3 doesn't live long without charging
09:29:13 <pravez[m]> hi :) is there a roadmap or something opened enough to know how to contribute to the project ? :)
10:20:55 <cg_droid> Some minites ago I tested Bluetooth in the car to receive calls with my wife. It worked to receive the call but the sound was received by the smartphone, not in the speakers

11:47:37 <derptacious> This was deleted: https://www.reddit.com/r/Qubes/comments/ebwoxv/response_to_daniel_micays_of_grapheneos_critique/
11:47:44 <derptacious> So I wonder what Daniel thinks of Qubes these days
11:48:11 <fll[m]> Battery saver mode is meant for "emergency" kind of use. Not meant to be used all the time
11:49:50 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_derptacious:matrix.org I dunno, but the package trust and insecure guests are serious issues
11:53:56 <cn3m[m]> ideally only one maintainer should maintain all the dom0 code
11:54:13 <cn3m[m]> sign*
11:55:29 <derptacious> cn3m[m] what does 'insecure guests' refer to again in QubesOS case?
11:57:22 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_derptacious:matrix.org Fedora which has no security model
11:57:35 <cn3m[m]> I think it actually rolls back some measures
11:59:05 <derptacious> cool, I didn't want to use it) I really like arch/void OSs
11:59:14 <derptacious> just wanted security at least as good
12:00:09 <lvkm[m]> using my pixel as a hotspot, would the connected devices would also go through the vpn?
12:01:27 <lvkm[m]> how about the private dns server?
12:01:47 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_derptacious:matrix.org you really need Windows or macOS for security
12:02:01 <cn3m[m]>  @nwiddkd:matrix.org no you need a root app like VPN Hotspot
12:03:54 <derptacious> cn3m[m] you need windows or mac for security? are you joking with me?
12:05:18 <lvkm[m]> <derptacious "cn3m you need windows or mac for"> security =/= privacy
12:06:17 <derptacious> privacy is based on security
12:06:31 <derptacious> and security is not based on obfuscation
12:06:33 <lvkm[m]> * security ≠ privacy
12:06:33 <boniek[m]> what about https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/
12:06:46 <derptacious> how can someone in this chat think osx/windows is the only way to go for computer security? baffling
12:06:49 <derptacious> or trolling...
12:07:12 <boniek[m]> he may be right, but security without privacy is kind of pointless to me
12:08:27 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <derptacious "how can someone in this chat thi"> The problem is that the vast majority of Linux desktop OSes have next to no security when it comes to preventing local privilege escalation. The kernel is full of holes, there's no sandboxing, etc.
12:09:40 <lvkm[m]> privacy needs security, security does not need privacy. a battlefield military network  for ex would be very secure but ofer no privacy to its users by design
12:09:49 <cn3m[m]>  @boniek:matrix.org Silverblue does nothing to fix the security model of Linux which is fundamentally broken.
12:10:11 <cn3m[m]> Linux security is hopeless at this point and all serious projects are planning to replace it

12:11:44 <EssentialChaos[m> 0xC0ncord: GNU/Hurd?
12:11:56 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "0xC0ncord: GNU/Hurd?"> Can't comment on it as I've never used it, sorry.
12:12:00 <cn3m[m]> Arch is insecure
12:12:36 <cn3m[m]> GNU/Hurd is not secure for a desktop due to no browser sandoxing
12:12:36 <EssentialChaos[m> 0xC0ncord: What did you have in mind then?
12:12:41 <cn3m[m]> much like BSD
12:13:01 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de Zircon, gvisor, Xen, KVM
12:13:06 <derptacious> just run your browser in firejail on arch... that's better than osx/windows

12:13:17 <cn3m[m]> Zircon is the most promising
12:13:26 <boniek[m]> So is there some sort of ChromiumOS distro available? Isn't it using linux kernel anyway?
12:13:35 <cn3m[m]>  @essentialchaos:tchncs.de yeah but it doesn't have the needed sandboxing yet
12:13:39 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_derptacious:matrix.org no bro

I've been using Gentoo for the longest time and lately I've been taking the plunge into SELinux configuration and running `linux-hardened` on top of Gentoo sources.

12:13:44 <cn3m[m]> it's a privilege escalation nightmare

12:14:16 <cn3m[m]> it also doesn't sandbox the renderer or tabs of the browser

12:14:35 <boniek[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "It is, but it's heavily locked d"> You can heavily lock down any linux distro...
12:14:46 <derptacious> sounds like there's a huge list of things generally considered good for security that are seen as useless or bad by security researchers... would be nice to have a full list :)
12:14:59 <cn3m[m]> ChromeOS is actually an AndroidOS if you want to get technical it meets the requirements
12:15:26 <EssentialChaos[m> <boniek[m] "You can heavily lock down any li"> Not like Chromium

12:16:35 <EssentialChaos[m> <derptacious "ok so how does one run a browser"> You start by running something Chromium based

12:33:50 <derptacious> for apps that need it
12:34:11 <highupper[m]> Docker is not a real sandbox.
12:34:34 <cn3m[m]> it's very deeply broken with countless known memory bugs  that have yet to be patched
12:34:36 <EssentialChaos[m> derptacious: Because it's a container, not a sandbox
12:34:37 <cn3m[m]> kernel exploits are the main issue
12:34:38 <EssentialChaos[m> It still exposes the same kernel to apps
12:34:43 <cn3m[m]> you want to improve security run gvisor
12:34:44 <cn3m[m]> it's not helpful
12:34:45 <cn3m[m]> and maybe hardened_malloc
12:34:47 <EssentialChaos[m> Depending on your hardware, you could try ChromiumOS

12:41:11 <derptacious> it is endless

12:42:15 <derptacious> I'd like to see me in a room all day using linux with chromium in docker. And the authors of stuxnet in the other room all day trying to get into my box. I'm just browsing and working all day, and they're trying to get in...
12:45:01 <EssentialChaos[m> derptacious: Docker is equivalent to running a second distro at the same time, like in a VM, except it uses the host kernel
12:45:01 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_derptacious:matrix.org you can run TeamViewer in Sandboxie
12:45:08 <cn3m[m]> 90% of sandboxes are bullshit
12:45:36 <cn3m[m]> host kernel is the biggest exploit attack surface on Chromium
12:46:48 <cn3m[m]> host kernel is the biggest exploit attack surface on Chromium
12:47:27 <derptacious> EssentialChaos[m sounds like a sandbox to me, especially considering it only has access to its own user.
12:49:59 <derptacious> and the kernel can have its own user namespaces, eh?
12:50:57 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_derptacious:matrix.org the chromium one is much much better than docker
12:52:54 <xabierd[m]> > The problem is that the vast majority of Linux desktop OSes have next to no security when it comes to preventing local privilege escalation. The kernel is full of holes, there's no sandboxing, etc.

13:37:19 <rndguy1[m]> Hi, i was wondering what data is saved when backing up my device using the integrated backup function (seedvault). The seedvault github repo isnt exactly clear if everything is saved, and their are some issues requesting backup functions for apps like signal which might use external storage. So my question is: does using the integrated backup function completely backup my device, including "external" storage (like
13:37:19 <rndguy1[m]> photos and so)? Meaning that if I restore the backup I have a device that matches the backed-up version exactly? Thanks for all answers!
13:45:26 <dazinism> rndguy1: it doesnt back up shared storage (the stuff you can see with the files app)
13:46:21 <dazinism> Backs up app data, for apps that let it
13:48:20 <dazinism> Also I think android settings maybe?  (I've not tried, and I may be getting confused)
13:49:51 <Marakesh> "for apps that let it"? why is it honoring android:allowbackup?
13:51:36 <dazinism> Marakesh :Because things can end up broken if you dont
13:51:53 <Marakesh> dazinism: like what?
13:52:56 <Marakesh> not having a decent backup is an horrifying experience when updating/reinstalling the phone :(
13:53:26 <Marakesh> and practically the only reason i haven't moved to graphene yet.
13:54:24 <Marakesh> there's adb backup that suppsedly works, but it respects allowbackup and too many app developers decided for us if they're backup-able or not.
13:54:54 <dazinism> The developer knows how they've set up their app, what kind data can be transfered to another device and things still work.
13:55:51 <Marakesh> they often have different interests than the users'.
13:55:55 <dazinism> Eg. Signals database is encrypted by the device keystore. On another device would be useless
13:57:14 <Marakesh> whatsapp's is also encrypted with the key stored in the app data, but that's out of bounds because of allowbackup=false.
13:57:32 <Marakesh> i doubt facebook knows better than we do about what we want to do with our chats.
14:01:11 <dazinism> Think the idea of seedvault is to be as painless and simple to use as possible.
14:03:38 <dazinism> Would all become a lot more difficult/confusing enabling backups of data that app developers dont want backed up
14:05:56 <dazinism> Think people have set it up to allow this, but it requires doing your own OS builds, not sure what their experience was like.
14:06:40 <dazinism> Using it with this enabled.
14:07:40 <dazinism> > not having a decent backup is an horrifying experience
14:08:49 <dazinism> Marakesh: with seedvault you get pretty much the same backup functionality as stock Androids.
14:10:08 <Marakesh> which is pretty horrible.
14:11:13 <dazinism> Depends on what apps you use - no?
14:11:59 <dazinism> Guess need to pit pressure on app devs to support the backup functionality thats provided for them to use
14:12:37 <dazinism> if they are not supporting backups
14:15:15 <Marakesh> dazinism: i guess you could argue the same about any other 'permission'; app devs know what internet access they need and what they want their apps to report back, yet we still decide for ourselves (that's a large part of what graphene exists for, no?)
14:20:42 <dazinism> GrapheneOS is a secure OS research and development project. Not sure that an extended-possibly-br eaking-things-and-confusing-users backup functionality adds to security
14:21:50 <dazinism> A key idea behind GrapheneOS is, as much as possible, to keep things simple and out of sight
14:22:52 <dazinism> Minimise extra user facing settings. Don't include things that may cause confusion.
14:23:54 <dazinism> I can see why you want to do WhatsApp backups, just adding that functionality would cause confusion.
14:27:08 <dazinism> Guess there may be the chance that seedvault would add this as an advanced user function, and if implemented well GrapheneOS would possibly pull that in.
14:27:29 <dazinism> Marakesh: suggest you open an issue on their github
14:29:23 <Marakesh> is it possible to have root access for something like titanium backup, that would be enabled or disabled when needed? i understand having root might be considered insecure to begin with, but considering what i mentioned...
14:31:31 <cx2[m]> > whatsapp's is also encrypted with the key stored in the app data, but that's out of bounds because of allowbackup=false.
14:31:31 <cx2[m]> Considering WhatsApp forces unencrypted backup to google drive, don't know that this matters much
14:32:10 <dazinism> Marakesh: think the easiest/safest way to do something like that is make your own userdebug builds of GrapheneOS and then you can access root via adb
14:32:22 <Marakesh> cx2[m] it does, if you refuse to put your unencrypted chat backups on google.
14:32:57 <Marakesh> dazinism: would that still allow locking the bootloader?
14:33:16 <dazinism> cx2: Think maybe all Google Backups are now encrypted (not researched it properly)
14:34:08 <Marakesh> practically speaking, i'm only after backing up Signal and Whatsapp. everything else is pretty much sorted out already.
14:34:12 <dazinism> Marakesh: yeah, with your own keys. Would have to build all OS updates yourself also.
14:34:56 <dazinism> Marakesh: think the only way for Signal is to use their built in backup mechanism
14:35:21 <Marakesh> dazinism: that sounds promising. the only downside i see is that root could be possibly used to alter system and make the system unbootable, am i correct?
14:38:16 <dazinism> Yeah, but you could just avoid doing that. Also you'd be highly trusting the computer that you use for adb, which is significantly less secure than your phone with GrapheneOS.
14:38:35 <Marakesh> i don't see how this is avoidable.
14:38:57 <Marakesh> thanks for the Signal backup tip. looks like Whatsapp is the only problem now.
14:39:07 <dazinism> Dont modify anything that verified boot checks
14:39:55 <dazinism> Marakesh: I noticed this https://f-droid.org/app/com.gmail.anubhavdas54.whatsdeleted
14:40:31 <Marakesh> this doesn't seem relevant.
14:40:50 <Marakesh> just backup and restore apps with titanium backup, i don't think this should modify anything AVB protects.
14:41:22 <dazinism> If you just need root to copy apps private data you don't need to alter any files that verified boot checks.
14:42:30 <Marakesh> could i then add/remove or enable/disable root access on demand?
14:44:31 <dazinism> Marakesh: think userdebug builds only allow root via adb.
14:45:11 <Marakesh> i'll look into that.
14:45:35 <dazinism> Although there are ways to enable access to adb on device
14:45:42 <Marakesh> on another subject, if i flash grapheneos and weird things happen, will i *always* be able to go back to oneplus'
14:45:48 <Marakesh> stock firmware, os, and everything?
14:46:00 <Marakesh> in other words, is it possible to hard-brick the device?
14:46:05 <dazinism> But have to set that up via the computer after each device reboot
14:46:30 <Marakesh> i really don't mind having to actively enable root every time. i actually prefer it this way.
14:48:01 <dazinism> Also I think I maybe saw something about a new feature coming to adb in Android R which makes stuff like that easier?
14:48:50 <dazinism> Marakesh: you are on OnePlus? Which device?
14:49:01 <Marakesh> dazinism: 7 pro (guacamole)
14:49:26 <Marakesh> maybe, i don't know. i do know that in the mean time i must be able to restore my whatsapp chats after changing to grapheneos, and that i need to be able to back it up every so often after that move.
14:50:16 <dazinism> Daniel, the main GrapheneOS dev doesnt like OnePlus isnt at all impressed by the device security.
14:50:45 <dazinism> Would be interesting to see you build GrapheneOS for the OnePlus
14:52:24 <Marakesh> i never claimed it's the most secure device in the market. i'd assume google's own devices likely aren't any more private than the rest.
14:52:48 <Marakesh> the device is here to stay, so if graphene can't work with it, unfortunately i'll have to look elsewhere.
14:52:52 <dazinism> Marakesh: anupritaisno1 has been working on the OP7pro
14:53:11 <Marakesh> he's been developing GlassROM, i know.
14:53:44 <Marakesh> he basically took graphene's security changes and applied them to lineageos.
14:54:51 <dazinism> Marakesh: also done a fair bit of stuff to work around security issues on your device
14:55:22 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot
14:56:00 <dazinism> Theres a link in there to the logs of this channel with some details
14:57:32 <dazinism> Marakesh: look through the whole day, mentions a few different things at different times
14:59:17 <dazinism> Marakesh: Think you could port GrapheneOS to work on OnePlus, but don't imagine it would ever be added as an official GrapheneOS device.
15:03:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> <dazinism "Marakesh: Think you could port G"> You can't
15:04:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's why glassrom exists
15:04:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Manufacturers add their own HALs and even use encryption that is not present in AOSP
15:04:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Firstly aosp will actually weaken some of these features
15:04:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example wrappedkey encryption isn't even present until R but CAF has had it since P
15:05:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Other than that there are many other hardware features you'd have to modify graphene to support regardless
15:05:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Such as the slider on the right of the phone
15:05:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or the weird camera hardware
15:06:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> That said this is only true for oneplus
15:07:02 <Marakesh> anupritaisno1[m] your 50 cents on patching out allowbackup before building?
15:07:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> If we're talking about a xiaomi which is just a generic board xiaomi rebranded and added a few features
15:07:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Those are seriously easy to boot off AOSP
15:07:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Since there are no nonstandard hardware pieces
15:08:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Marakesh "anupritaisno1 your 50 cents on p"> What do you mean?
15:09:08 <Marakesh> it seems quite reasonable to patch out a couple of if clauses in the source code of adb backup
15:09:13 <EssentialChaos[m> <anupritaisno1[m] "Those are seriously easy to boot"> All of them or just Android One?
15:09:41 <Marakesh> to effectively make adb backup ignore the allow backup flag of apps
15:09:53 <cdesai> Android one is just like any other device, same sort of work needed.
15:10:09 <cdesai> the benefits are regular / monthly security updates, saner stock, etc.
15:10:26 <cdesai> some like the a2 support custom verified boot, which is a big plus
15:12:53 <Marakesh> though dazinism mentioned this might be creating other issues.
15:13:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "All of them or just Android One?"> All
15:14:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Mostly devices that are just factory models that just get rebranded are easy to boot off aosp
15:14:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because the manufacturer himself doesn't want to work much on it
15:14:55 <EssentialChaos[m> I wonder, if Mi 9T with its pop up camera will work
15:15:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Popup camera is completely in the kernel
15:15:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> You just need a camera motor HAL in userspace
15:15:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> The HAL handles a few cases like free fall and if the popup camera gets stuck
15:16:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> But just one HAL is easy enough to implement

17:37:53 <ra101[m]> hey guys i just update the pdf app from the play store and it is crashing i even reinstall the app
17:38:04 <ra101[m]> it is still crashing
17:42:09 <cg_droid> ra101[m], when I click on a pdf file it opens ok
17:42:20 <cg_droid> Do you mean opening the app only?
17:42:37 <cg_droid> IN that case yes, it's like a black screen
17:42:44 <cg_droid> But the app works with pdfs
17:48:45 <cg_droid> What's your opinion about Iridium browser?, I see that Ungoogled Chromium shares code, I think, with them
17:49:12 <cg_droid> Sorry: a white screen (pdfviewer)
17:51:59 <strcat[m]> I can reproduce the PDF Viewer issue
17:52:13 <strcat[m]> all I can say is that the project desperately needs help and issues like this will continue and become more frequent
17:52:19 <strcat[m]> because I have less and less time/energy for it
17:52:24 <strcat[m]> and people haven't stepped up to help much
17:52:49 <cg_droid> strcat[m], it works ok opening pdfs, I think it's not a problem
17:52:58 <strcat[m]> it is a problem
17:53:16 <williamstopus[m]> <strcat[m] "and people haven't stepped up to"> how can we help?
17:53:17 <strcat[m]> I need help resolving it and working on the other issues filed in the tracker
17:53:17 <dazinism> BalooRJ: it only backs up app data
17:53:30 <strcat[m]> asked for help yesterday on this
17:53:30 <mxnorvak[m]> <ra101[m] "it is still crashing "> I have the same problem
17:53:30 <hitchhooker[m]> I can send you file to reproduce it
17:53:38 <strcat[m]> I think I will need to cancel the June release
17:53:59 <strcat[m]> and drop Pixel 2 / 2 XL early
17:54:00 <BalooRJ> dazinism - That's good to know, think an 8GB flash drive would be enough then? I wanted to give it a try with what I had lying around really
17:54:03 <dazinism> williamstopus: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
17:54:09 <blacklight447[m]> <cg_droid "What's your opinion about Iridiu"> Iridium is behind on updates
17:54:27 <cg_droid> blacklight447[m], a lot?
17:54:33 <dazinism> That was written a while back, but been updated a bit. Think mainly still relevant
17:54:43 <williamstopus[m]> <strcat[m] "and drop Pixel 2 / 2 XL early"> good idea no one uses those hardwares anyway
17:55:13 <strcat[m]> yes they do
17:55:19 <strcat[m]> and you won't be so happy when the Pixel 3 is dropped
17:56:04 <strcat[m]> just put things into hibernation until the current attacks on myself and the project are addressed + there are developers to continue it
17:56:05 <cg_droid> I wish I could help!!! but I haven't that knowledge 🙁
17:56:11 <williamstopus[m]> <strcat[m] "and you won't be so happy when t"> if they wanting to use they can help
17:56:32 <strcat[m]> well, it hasn't happened, so seems things need to be put into hibernation for the time being
17:56:49 <williamstopus[m]> dont dropping pixel 3a okay 😼
17:57:02 <strcat[m]> why not? has no maintainers
17:57:16 <hitchhooker[m]> Well there is no maintainers for 3a either
17:57:21 <strcat[m]> can just start over with the Pixel 5 or Pixel 6, or some other device in the future
17:57:36 <strcat[m]> when the project is better positioned to move forward
17:57:54 <strcat[m]> not under constant attack, maybe actually receiving some substantial support / help
17:58:05 <strcat[m]> doesn't seem things are on a path to success right now
17:58:11 <chickensupreme[m> i would like to help with the pdfviewer, i posted some messages in here last night asking for help with it - when i compile it myself (without changes) the app just crashes on startup
17:58:25 <strcat[m]> help wanted
17:59:09 <BalooRJ> What would it cost for the project to hire a developer to do some of the major lifting to maintain even one device?
17:59:18 <strcat[m]> I don't really see how this latest update of it could have screwed anything up though
17:59:20 <strcat[m]> if I look at the diff
17:59:33 <hitchhooker[m]> Yeah so it seems community cant code shit so perhaps we should go for pair/group programming effort to tackle these issues
17:59:44 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: I don't know, but I won't be hiring developers
17:59:45 <strcat[m]> I'm not a company
17:59:47 <BalooRJ> Judging from the amount of people sitting in this chatroom and subscribed to the subreddit, may be easier to craft a donation campaign than attempt to get volunteers since the community (myself included) knows nothing about coding high level android devices
17:59:54 <strcat[m]> if a company wants to hire developers to work on the project they are free to do that
17:59:58 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS is not a company
18:00:03 <BalooRJ> strcat: Fair enough.
18:00:07 <strcat[m]> no amount of donations will result in hiring a developer
18:00:13 <strcat[m]> not in the position to do that
18:00:37 <strcat[m]> plus the donations are all needed to handle the legal attacks on the project
18:00:49 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/compare/3...4
18:00:53 <strcat[m]> this is a diff of v3 to v4
18:01:04 <strcat[m]> I can't see how this would cause the issues ppl have reported
18:01:12 <strcat[m]> trying to reproduce it - can't actually reproduce it
18:01:52 <BalooRJ> Well...count me in for another donation to cover some legal fees, not much but hope it helps
18:02:17 <strcat[m]> ok think I figured it out actually
18:02:50 <zoraver[m]> strcat: looking at the diff, something that jumps out at me is that `.getScheme` is called on mUri without checking if it is not null first
18:03:00 <strcat[m]> yeah dealt with that
18:04:18 <analog[m]> strcat https://old.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/gs4uv7/i_dont_fully_trust_grapheneos/
18:04:18 <analog[m]> I keep seeing the same stuff everytime by random people.
18:05:19 <analog[m]> The GrapheneOS name keeps getting attacked on this platform excessively.
18:05:46 <chickensupreme[m> okay i didn't realize the pdfviewer source on git was different from the pdfviewer app in the latest update, i assumed it was something in my setup that was causing it to crash
18:05:57 <chickensupreme[m> looking at the error i get more carefully it is
18:06:09 <chickensupreme[m> java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start activity ComponentInfo{org.grapheneos.pdfviewer.debug/org.grapheneos.pdfviewer.PdfViewer}: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'java.lang.String android.net.Uri.getScheme()' on a null object reference
18:06:11 <chickensupreme[m> at org.grapheneos.pdfviewer.PdfViewer.onCreate(PdfViewer.java:305)
18:06:15 <chickensupreme[m> which is the mURI.getScheme line
18:14:57 <strcat[m]> chickensupreme: it is not different, and there are tags
18:15:27 <strcat[m]> this issue is in the past
18:15:29 <strcat[m]> the real problem is lack of help in general
18:15:33 <strcat[m]> I was asking for help repeatedly before I finally decided to tag a new release
18:15:47 <strcat[m]> I think people remember that
18:16:22 <strcat[m]> and I only tested it via opening pdfs from other apps, I don't have time to do everything, there need to be developers/maintainers for components like this
18:16:28 <strcat[m]> active progress improving them, active testing
18:16:46 <strcat[m]> someone to sign off on doing a release
18:17:41 <strcat[m]> leaving everything up to me is not a viable approach - it will require increasingly scaling back, not overextending further (no new devices), etc. and ultimately putting most of this on hold and not doing official releases, just keeping the code alive
18:19:18 <strcat[m]> also see the Bluetooth issue I keep asking for help with
18:19:20 <strcat[m]> or camera issues
18:19:32 <strcat[m]> along with you know, developing the project as a whole
18:19:37 <strcat[m]> maintaining devices (there are 0 device maintainers)
18:20:00 <strcat[m]> if I set a final date for dropping devices without maintainers that will be the date the project ends
18:20:10 <strcat[m]> but I can't keep doing it all myself
18:20:13 <strcat[m]> so what should I do?
18:21:26 <strcat[m]> valldrac: https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/grsy8f/wired_audio_output_not_working/ could be related to your change even though it doesn't seem like it
18:21:43 <strcat[m]> valldrac: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/220
18:21:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat you need help?
18:22:20 <strcat[m]> yes, lots of help... all over the project
18:23:52 <strcat[m]> if people haven't realized it is largely stalled and rotting away from lack of help
18:24:15 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah...
18:24:40 <strcat[m]> there are multiple serious issues that need to be addressed promptly
18:24:42 <strcat[m]> the Bluetooth, camera and wired audio issues need to be resolved among other things - those are high priorities
18:24:54 <strcat[m]> each of the existing devices needs maintainers
18:25:12 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4 and 4 XL need maintainers to fully develop support up to the standards of the project and get it landed before it's too close to Android 11
18:25:28 <strcat[m]> and all of the components need to be actively developed / maintained across the project
18:25:47 <strcat[m]> hardened_malloc, Auditor, AttestationServer, PdfViewer, the Bionic libc hardening work, and tons of other stuff
18:25:57 <strcat[m]> all needs active development/maintenance
18:26:07 <strcat[m]> the kernel hardening work needs to be revived and added back
18:26:22 <strcat[m]> the linux-hardened project needs to be actively developed again
18:26:35 <strcat[m]> the stable kernel changes need to be merged downstream again to get them sooner too
18:26:37 <strcat[m]> in an automated way
18:26:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "the Bluetooth, camera and wired "> What's the issue with wired audio?
18:26:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: don't know
18:26:54 <strcat[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/grsy8f/wired_audio_output_not_working/
18:27:01 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/220
18:27:13 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: valldrac did some good work narrowing down the Bluetooth issue and tried to fix it
18:27:25 <strcat[m]> but his fix led to other issues including Bluetooth issues and perhaps this too even though it seems unrelated
18:27:32 <strcat[m]> since I don't see what else could have caused it
18:27:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> What devices
18:27:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Only pixel 3xl?
18:27:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: probably all
18:28:00 <cg_droid> PIxel 3a too
18:28:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: probably all"> What would you say is the culprit?
18:28:36 <strcat[m]> and btw not getting issue reports
18:28:38 <strcat[m]> is a major issue
18:28:47 <strcat[m]> when a release is in beta for 2 days and I get no reports
18:28:48 <strcat[m]> and push it out to stable
18:29:02 <strcat[m]> and then only get reports 2-3 days after that
18:29:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wired audio is fine here
18:29:10 <strcat[m]> the issue is with the testing of the beta channel
18:29:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let me check
18:29:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: ok but it's not fine in GrapheneOS
18:29:24 <chickensupreme[m> ok well i'm going to try my hand at some of the pdfviewer issues, i haven't done development in about 10 years so i'm new to git and tags and modern ide's and such, but i just got the pdfviewer to run by adding a check for mUri != null so i'll see what i can do with the issues on git
18:29:32 <strcat[m]> I need help with GrapheneOS
18:29:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hardened malloc is 82440e78d9cbda71f8e0ca49b14381e56618eb55 here
18:29:52 <strcat[m]> there are issues uncovered by hardened_malloc and the attempted fix for these Bluetooth issues caused more problems
18:29:54 <strcat[m]> I hope that makes sense
18:29:57 <strcat[m]> I need help addressing this
18:30:03 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "but his fix led to other issues "> Bluetooth has been working perfectly fine on my 3a
18:30:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Want me to upgrade it to the latest and check?
18:30:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <blacklight447[m] "Bluetooth has been working perfe"> Wired. Audio.
18:30:58 <strcat[m]> it's not working fine for many people
18:31:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do we have logs?
18:31:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anything?
18:31:04 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: both are broken
18:31:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "there are issues uncovered by ha"> What is that commit?
18:31:07 <strcat[m]> it is known that there are problems - I don't need confirmation, I need help fixing them, and next time around I need better Beta channel testing and actively reporting issues ASAP
18:31:08 <TheJollyRoger> I had to turn off the hardware offload...? I didn't catch anything with the CTS yet.
18:31:14 <TheJollyRoger> (reports are on my github gist)
18:31:45 <cg_droid> blacklight447[m], today in my pixel 3a I received a call and I could touch the button in the car to talk but the sound was from the smartphone, not from the car speakers
18:31:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: there are 2 issues about these things on the tracker
18:31:58 <strcat[m]> can ask for info that's needed, valldrac asked for bluetooth audio setup dumps
18:32:02 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: set it back to how it normally is, no workarounds in dev options
18:32:05 <strcat[m]> that is not something regular users will do
18:32:08 <strcat[m]> ok look everyone
18:32:10 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
18:32:15 <strcat[m]> please read both issues on the tracker
18:32:16 <blacklight447[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Wired. Audio."> Wired works fine as well
18:32:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "please read both issues on the t"> Alright
18:32:30 <strcat[m]> don't reply before reading
18:32:30 <strcat[m]> thanks
18:32:41 <TheJollyRoger> Got it.
18:32:52 <TheJollyRoger> I do have some stuff for you that's kind of unrelated though...
18:33:09 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/217
18:33:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW did you pull an updated vendor?
18:33:18 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/220
18:33:23 <strcat[m]> these are new issues, they are confirmed to be issues
18:33:28 <strcat[m]> help is needed to resolve them
18:33:37 <strcat[m]> I don't know if I should roll back valldrac's fix in the meantime
18:33:43 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no not in the last release
18:33:44 <sphinxpy[m]> Would more beta testing help as well?
18:33:50 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: I'll repeat my test results in the meantime with hardware offload set to "OFF"
18:33:58 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it wasn't a monthly update
18:34:01 * TheJollyRoger puts his cellphone back on the rack.
18:34:05 <strcat[m]> and the AOSP Alliance changes were inconsequential to the output
18:34:15 <strcat[m]> sphinx.py: yes if people report issues the day it's released
18:34:22 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: no
18:34:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "I don't know if I should roll ba"> What is the fix
18:34:27 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: set it to how it normally is
18:34:36 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
18:34:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW please show the commit that fixes it
18:34:40 <TheJollyRoger> Ok! One moment.
18:34:53 <strcat[m]> anyway desperately need help with these things among others
18:35:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: platform_frameworks_av
18:35:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "and the AOSP Alliance changes we"> Also how do you log it?
18:35:07 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: that is the attempted fix
18:35:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you're connected to wired audio
18:35:13 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it caused more problems though
18:35:20 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it is listed in the issue
18:35:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can't adb logcat
18:35:32 <TheJollyRoger> There we go. It's set and back on the rack.
18:35:47 <strcat[m]> there are 3 relevant issues on the trackers, they have links
18:35:49 <aeonsolution[m]> if there are people trying to get started with setting up the development branch or don't know where to start, please send me a message; i can help you out. all i ask as that you read the build instructions https://grapheneos.org/build; we all can contribute
18:35:53 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: don't know about these things need help with them
18:36:03 <strcat[m]> there is the tool for dumping state
18:36:11 <sphinxpy[m]> Ok, i will change my update channel and test.
18:36:16 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction]if there are people trying to get started with setting up the development branch or don't know where to start, please send me a message; i can help you out. all i ask is that you read the build instructions https://grapheneos.org/build; we all can contribute
18:37:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> This is helpful too: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os
18:38:07 <sphinxpy[m]> aeonsolution: I can do this as well. Will message you in a bit if that is ok
18:40:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> So strcat
18:40:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> When did you enable SLOT_RANDOMIZE?
18:43:07 <aeonsolution[m]> <sphinxpy[m] "aeonsolution: I can do this as w"> yes, definitely!
18:43:12 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: has always been enabled
18:43:27 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the problem was there for a long time, valldrac tried to fix it, his fix caused other issues
18:43:32 <strcat[m]> I think it's clear from the 3 issues
18:44:26 <strcat[m]> Bluetooth audio issues -> someone figures out SLOT_RANDOMIZE uncovers the upstream bug -> valldrac figures out what seems to be the cause and attempts to fix it -> this fix is released in the last GrapheneOS release -> the fix resolves some of the problems but introduces NEW problems
18:44:27 <strcat[m]> understand?
18:44:56 <strcat[m]> I need help resolving the new problems / making a proper fix because the current attempt created new problems, didn't make things strictly better
18:45:01 <strcat[m]> I think it's clear from the 3 issues
18:45:07 <strcat[m]> the wired audio issue may or may not be related
18:45:21 <strcat[m]> also, I really need help resolving, I don't want to argue about whether the problems exist (they do) or anything like that
18:45:36 <strcat[m]> help is needed to resolve this, that's all
18:46:24 <strcat[m]> the original issues were definitely uncovered by SLOT_RANDOMIZE, we know that, and we know that valldrac's fix did successfully fix a lot of it BUT it also created NEW problems that didn't exist before
18:46:54 <strcat[m]> I don't think I am going to roll back the fix, so help is desperately needed to resolve this fully so that bluetooth call audio works properly again
18:47:26 <strcat[m]> and whatever is wrong with wired audio (USB C digital audio?) needs to be identified and narrowed down
18:47:36 <strcat[m]> someone able to reproduce that needs to narrow down what causes it
18:47:45 <strcat[m]> revert this bluetooth change and other changes, figure out what caused the issue
18:47:50 <strcat[m]> step one is figuring out what caused it
18:48:02 <strcat[m]> every day that it's not narrowed down will make it harder to figure out what caused it since things will change more
18:48:18 <strcat[m]> we need people actively working on the project - this is just ONE small example of what needs to be done
18:49:03 <strcat[m]> this is not the extent of the help that's needed, it is one recent high priority issue we need to fix ASAP ideally before next monday
18:49:10 <strcat[m]> need help with this now
18:49:22 <strcat[m]> I don't know how to make it more clear than this
18:49:41 <TheJollyRoger-M> Shit.
18:49:49 <strcat[m]> please read the 3 issues - the original bluetooth issue, the new one based on the attempted fix (which does seem to fix the original issue, largely) and the wired audio issue
18:50:20 <strcat[m]> need to identify what causes the wired audio issue, confirm that the bluetooth fix caused the bluetooth call issue and figure out how to resolve both new problems
18:50:35 <strcat[m]> so, should be doing an unmodified build right now and confirming both issues
18:50:44 <strcat[m]> then reverting the bluetooth fix and seeing if that causes them
18:50:58 <strcat[m]> and then doing further work to figure out what's wrong and fix it
18:51:14 <strcat[m]> maybe the usb audio issue is caused by something else - maybe it was caused by the kernel compilation changes, I don't know
18:51:23 <strcat[m]> if I knew it would probably already be fixed, that is generally how things are
18:51:33 <strcat[m]> if I knew, I'd just fix it
18:51:50 <strcat[m]> need help figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it for both classes of issues
18:53:31 <strcat[m]> I can't even get out a tiny release of the PDF Viewer app right now without screwing it up so if people expect me to continue the entire project myself without stepping up and providing substantial help that's not going to work
18:54:02 <strcat[m]> I have to do this work while people are actively spreading misinformation / attacks on me, harassing me, threatening / doxxing me
18:54:12 <strcat[m]> and I don't get much help dealing with that either
18:54:34 <strcat[m]> and it has serious consequences for my time/energy, ability to focus on the project and be productive
18:54:47 <strcat[m]> and avoiding making things worse rather than better
18:55:08 <strcat[m]> just did a v5 release of PDF Viewer and accidentally pushed a pointless revert, as an example
18:55:17 <strcat[m]> doesn't matter but is stupid
18:58:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Okay now that I've officially woken up all my neighbors
18:58:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Bluetooth audio is working
18:58:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw strcat yes
18:59:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kernel compilation changes can cause it
18:59:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Remove -ftrivial-auto-var-init and check once
18:59:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> I know somebody on a pixel 3 who did =pattern once and reported that USB was broken
19:05:18 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I wouldn'
19:05:29 <strcat[m]>  * anupritaisno1: I wouldn't expect zero init to cause problems and that was not added in this release
19:05:37 <strcat[m]> that was added a while ago
19:05:43 <strcat[m]> you can see our changelog on the site for the past release
19:06:16 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: if you're testing bluetooth audio on something other than GrapheneOS itself you aren't testing the same thing, you probably don't have the frameworks/av change among other things
19:06:44 <strcat[m]> I don't need confirmation of whether there's a problem, I know there is a problem
19:06:50 <strcat[m]> what I need is help fixing these issues
19:07:02 <TheJollyRoger> strcat[m]: do you still have one or both of those debugging cables functioning? Is one broken, or are both of them broken?
19:07:25 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: one is broken, one may still work properly but haven't used it for a while
19:07:30 <TheJollyRoger> Ok.
19:07:31 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: doesn't matter right now
19:07:33 <strcat[m]> don't have time to do much anyway
19:08:16 <strcat[m]> it's not helpful for me to be arguing about whether these things are issues
19:08:34 <cn3m[m]>  @strcat:matrix.org exactly how could one help with GrapheneOS and a Pixel 3a testing wise? I'm on the beta channel
19:08:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: if you're testing"> Yeah I don't have that CFI violation
19:08:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW strcat (@strcat:matrix.org) your recent change is valid
19:08:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's not a CFI violation
19:08:52 <strcat[m]> what recent change
19:09:06 <strcat[m]> look you're just confusing me
19:09:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> In pdfviewer
19:09:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you're testing the bluetooth / audio stuff on something that's not GrapheneOS and I don't think you have the frameworks/av change anyway
19:09:43 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't really help
19:10:07 <strcat[m]> if you don't have the change that broke it then yeah, it won't be broken in the same way
19:10:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "look you're just confusing me"> Sorry
19:10:14 <strcat[m]> and please, read all 3 of the threads

19:10:26 <strcat[m]> the new thread about issues caused by the attempted fix
19:10:29 <strcat[m]> and the USB audio one
19:10:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well I can help with the pdfviewer
19:10:40 <strcat[m]> you can see that NOT EVERYONE had the original issues and NOT EVERYONE has the new one
19:10:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "and I don't get much help dealin"> If you are seeing places where this is not being handled, please say so: we are organized and combatting this wherever we find it. You are NOT alone.
19:10:46 <strcat[m]> specific circumstances are needed to trigger them
19:11:11 <strcat[m]> it is confirmed that it's a real issue though - I don't need confirmation of it working / not working, I need help resolving the issues
19:11:20 <strcat[m]> doesn't help to say it works or doesn't work
19:11:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "specific circumstances are neede"> What help do you need in pdfviewer?
19:11:39 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: fixing the snackbar on screen rotation is 1 minor bug
19:11:46 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: updating pdf.js is a major priority for it
19:11:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Got it
19:12:01 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: last time I tried to update, pdf.js inherited Content Security Policy violations from dependencies
19:12:07 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: and it has a ridiculously large dep tree
19:12:12 <strcat[m]> and they passed blame upstream
19:12:15 <strcat[m]> and those people passed blame further upstream
19:12:23 <strcat[m]> and it was too hard to figure out what to do so it hasn't been updated since
19:12:27 <strcat[m]> maybe the problem is resolved now - no clue
19:12:32 <strcat[m]> pdf.js needs to be updated tho
19:12:52 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: + a bunch of features need to be added / improved https://github.com/GrapheneOS/PdfViewer/issues
19:13:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: but the main things: fixing snackbar on screen rotate, updating pdf.js, fixing pinch to zoom to stay centered on where it's done
19:14:51 <stuux[m]> strcat: do those issues require mostly Java Script ?
19:17:21 <strcat[m]> Java (Kotlin when it eventually migrates) and JavaScript
19:17:36 <strcat[m]> and it's just a standalone app, easy to work on
19:18:25 <nikoleos[m]> Is it a good or not idea to get a pixel 3a now to run GrapheneOS on term of long support ?
19:18:44 <neothechosenone[> <strcat[m] "I can't even get out a tiny rele"> I know after the incident with your partner has caused you to be against any form of company and making money but do you think maybe if you were in charge of everything company wise as well and the company was bringing in money for the project things would be a lot easier ?
19:19:40 <strcat[m]> neothechosenone: GrapheneOS is not a company and won't be a company
19:19:51 <strcat[m]> I am not going to be running a company or hiring people
19:19:59 <strcat[m]> that doesn't mean people can't be hired to work on the project
19:20:02 <strcat[m]> but it won't be me doing it
19:20:20 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS will at  most be a non-profit organization and right now I don't have people to delegate stuff to
19:20:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > that doesn't mean people can't be hired to work on the project
19:20:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > but it won't be me doing it
19:20:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> What can someone do to gain trust to become that person to delegate these things to?
19:20:57 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't trust anyone else to own it but I can't manage it myself so I'd need someone to deal with making it and managing the whole thing
19:21:02 <strcat[m]> and if it hires people someone else would have to deal with all that
19:21:11 <strcat[m]> no point asking me to do it - will never happen

19:27:26 <strcat[m]> in general I want / need concrete help
19:27:33 <strcat[m]> my time / energy is maxed out so suggestions/advice don't really go anywhere

19:28:02 <strcat[m]> was responding to what was said earlier

19:28:47 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "my time / energy is maxed out so"> Please consider appointing someone (willing and interested in the position) to be a community manager. I nominate TheJollyRoger.
19:29:31 <strcat[m]> I could do that
19:29:38 <strcat[m]> just doesn't change much imo
19:29:57 <strcat[m]> and the problems are mostly not in the GrapheneOS community at least here
19:30:00 <strcat[m]> there are not many problems here
19:30:12 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "just doesn't change much imo"> If a community manager isn't effective, nix them. If a hired dev isn't worth accepting a PR, don't merge it, and we'll fire them.

19:30:29 <strcat[m]>  * there are problems on Reddit which I have dealt with by setting the spam filter to treat 100% of posts as spam
19:30:37 <strcat[m]> I would rather just get rid of reddit of have people come here
19:30:52 <strcat[m]> someone could volunteer to go through reddit posts and reply to them
19:31:13 <cn3m[m]> Bullshit circles when security charlatans go around misinformation. I've been specifically targeted by people who hate GrapheneOS. If I respond to them for long enough with strong enough points they start walking it back. People need to be educated. This is logical thing that people have been duped into not believing
19:31:17 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org thank you for all you do
19:31:23 <cn3m[m]> the community needs to either be running betas and reporting bugs, stopping misinformation(specifically on public permanent records like Reddit or Forums)
19:31:24 <strcat[m]> I need someone to volunteer to deal with reddit
19:31:30 <strcat[m]> there is a very specific way I want it done though
19:31:32 <cn3m[m]> or coding
19:31:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "there are problems on Reddit whi"> Arathorn(?) is the community manager of Matrix, and coordinates the combatting of disinformation on many platforms, official channels and other channels, and also guides people towards ways they can help the project. We need someone like that, because naturally everyone's looking to you, strcat, for this, without someone else to point to, and you are understandably
19:31:33 <DannyWorkOrderPr> too busy!
19:31:43 <strcat[m]> I mostly need them to just do a quick reply to every post
19:32:03 <strcat[m]> and approve posts past spam filter ONLY if they are valuable in some way
19:32:07 <strcat[m]> i.e. some actual discussion worth having
19:32:12 <strcat[m]> something where other people's input is valuable
19:32:21 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <strcat[m] "I mostly need them to just do a "> Right, great point. Comments left unabated are taken as truth by most readers, which is incorrect.
19:32:38 <strcat[m]> yeah which is part of why I had to filter all reddit posts
19:32:44 <cn3m[m]>  @strcat:matrix.org I'm on Reddit all day every day and have read your entire site 10 times I've counted
19:32:45 <cn3m[m]> I'll help if you want me
19:32:47 <strcat[m]> because people claim false stuff even as part of asking a questiobn
19:32:52 <strcat[m]> and cause never-ending drama / concern / problems
19:33:02 <strcat[m]> and also people just keep asking the same stuff over and over again
19:33:11 <strcat[m]> and it makes it harder and harder to find the previous in-depth answers
19:33:12 <cn3m[m]> I have read 50% of all your Reddit comments of all time
19:33:21 <strcat[m]> since if you search for it you mostly find the newer posts without answers
19:33:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cn3m[m] "I'll help if you want me "> cn3m is doing a great job coordinating behind the scenes, strcat - a good choice, IMO
19:33:37 <strcat[m]> so it's important to block people from making more posts about topics unless the new discussion will be better
19:33:40 <cn3m[m]> If you need help with Reddit I'm always available. I'll answer stupid questions over and over again if you would like
19:33:43 <strcat[m]> cn3m: I can make you a mod of the subreddit
19:33:53 <strcat[m]> cn3m:  you need to look in the moderator queue to see all the new (filtered) posts
19:34:08 <strcat[m]> cn3m: and mostly just reply to them from there... and don't approve them unless there is some reason it's valuable to have a new post
19:34:15 <strcat[m]> and point people to #grapheneos (here) generally
19:34:19 <cn3m[m]> I will do that
19:34:26 <cn3m[m]> /u/cn3m
19:34:27 <strcat[m]> the subreddit just sucks because if I just approve posts
19:34:34 <strcat[m]> people are unlikely to get good answers and it just makes things worse
19:34:42 <strcat[m]> and it just floods it with posts about the same 3 topics
19:34:46 <strcat[m]> when is Pixel 4 support
19:34:50 <strcat[m]> etc
19:34:59 <chani> could I also suggest, for questions that are asked over and over again on the reddit (such as the "what app should I use for x"), perhaps some stickied posts that consolidate the advice given by people who actually have good answers?
19:35:06 <strcat[m]> don't need a daily post asking when Pixel 4 will be supported - just gets harder and harder to find a good answer imo
19:35:20 <strcat[m]> among other things that just come up again and again
19:35:23 <strcat[m]> cn3m: what's your reddit username
19:35:25 <strcat[m]> same thing?
19:35:26 <strcat[m]> cn3m?
19:35:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> > /u/cn3m
19:36:03 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Yes, strcat
19:36:37 <chani> I realize a lot of those questions are addressed on the FAQs on the grapheneos.com site, but that doesn't stop people from asking the questions in the reddit.
19:36:48 <chani> subreddit*
19:37:14 <DannyWorkOrderPr> cn3m/strcat a single stickied post with links to all the most commonly asked/submitted questions would be huge.
19:37:56 <cn3m[m]> understood
19:38:00 <cn3m[m]> I understand it's not worth your time
19:38:01 <cn3m[m]> /u/cn3m
19:38:03 <cn3m[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "cn3m: can you also make this roo"> that's the matrix not the subreddit
19:38:05 <cn3m[m]> it also makes people read the description
19:38:06 <cn3m[m]> if people don't they probably won't be productive on the Matrix
19:38:06 <cn3m[m]> it's a good bs filter for people who don't read descriptions
19:38:07 <cn3m[m]>  @freenode_chani:matrix.org that will be my job to quote the website and save Daniel time
19:38:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Strcat why is the pdf.js a single line in your case
19:38:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> A really huge line
19:39:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or should I follow and minify it like that?

19:46:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cn3m[m] "The site is a comprehensive reso"> Right, just not in the tl;dr durrrrr format that reddit users and Twitter have grown accustomed to learning/reading things in. Proper paragraphs, haha - something I was grateful for, but others, especially new people, may not be.
19:54:04 <cn3m[m]> tl;dr durrr people aren't helpful to the project, but they are root sources for misinformation
19:54:34 <cn3m[m]> if they get short explanations they blow up and make posts attacking the community
19:55:06 <valldrac> strcat[m]: I received the BT headset today. Let me check if I can reproduce the issues. It should be fast. Then we can make a decision. Right now I feel the best would be revert my commit
19:55:31 <TheJollyRoger> standing by to test an update.
19:58:25 <madaidan[m]> strcat I can also help with reddit if you want.
20:58:35 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it is a normal minified build of pdf.js included as an asset
20:58:41 <strcat[m]> it is the pdf.js build system that minifies it
20:59:02 <strcat[m]> it is not developed inside PdfViewer, it's included unmodified as an asset after building it
20:59:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/pdf.js
20:59:41 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: need to update this to the latest stable release and any Content Security Policy issues in the latest release of pdf.js or any of the dependencies needs to be worked around
21:00:01 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: last time I tried to update it, there were serious issues introduced via dependencies and it couldn't be shipped
21:00:06 <strcat[m]> and I didn't have time to figure it out and fix it
21:00:15 <strcat[m]> it was reported upstream by others and they didn't really care + passed along blame
21:00:24 <strcat[m]> and upstreams passed along blame too
21:00:29 <strcat[m]> there are like 500 dependencies in a big tree
21:00:38 <strcat[m]> and they won't take responsibility for stuff their dependencies cause
21:00:46 <strcat[m]> and sometimes it's unclear who is responsible
21:00:57 <strcat[m]> in this case I think some project was using a feature not supported in ES5
21:01:12 <strcat[m]> and babel was generating dynamic code evaluation as a workaround
21:01:23 <strcat[m]> ideally the code would just target modern browsers and not use this kind of nonsense for backwards compat
21:01:30 <strcat[m]> maybe there is some way to enable that - I don't know
21:01:35 <strcat[m]> maybe it is already solved - I don't know
21:01:39 <strcat[m]> as usual if I knew these things
21:01:42 <strcat[m]> I would have solved it myself
21:02:07 <strcat[m]> if it was simply a matter of setting es6 mode somewhere and building that  way - and maybe it is - I would have done it
21:02:26 <strcat[m]> I don't have the answers to why things are broken or I'd have applied the answers to fix it
21:02:44 <hypokeimenon[m]> christ strcat you're going above and beyond with your explanations in the recent privacytools reddit thread
21:10:45 <valldrac> strcat[m]: at first everything works flawless, both audio and calls. After some time in the 3rd reboot, it starts doing crazy things with the volume and the audio routing
21:11:17 <valldrac> strcat[m]: man, any bugfix will require a LOT of testing
21:13:10 <madaidan[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "christ strcat you're going above"> Love seeing him ruining TheAnonymouseJoker
21:13:30 <valldrac> strcat[m]: I suggest you to revert my commit. The previous bug at least had a known workaround
21:14:52 <valldrac> strcat[m]: My feeling is that we're hitting more than one single bug now
21:15:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> <madaidan[m] "Love seeing him ruining TheAnony"> tbh that guy just seems to really (close-mindedly) hate Google
21:20:06 <madaidan[m]> <spaceinfinite[m] "Link? Cant seem to find it"> https://old.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/gs4uv7/i_dont_fully_trust_grapheneos/

21:57:49 <hypokeimenon[m]> cn3m: doing good work in that thread too
21:57:50 <cn3m[m]> hypokeimenon: They went to my home turf. PTIO :)
22:06:06 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cn3m[m] "tl;dr durrr people aren't helpfu"> Nontechnical Tech influencers are the ones spreading the knowledge of the project on social media, on reddit, to their friends, etc - which leads to better mindshare, which leads to more devs. Disinfo too? Sure. But you can't have one without the other.
22:06:36 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <cn3m[m] "if they get short explanations t"> We need to keep finding the midground =]
22:35:46 <strcat[m]> this guy just sees himself as the arbiter of what is / isn't backdoored
22:35:50 <strcat[m]> arbitrarily claims X is backdoored, Y is not
22:35:57 <strcat[m]> no evidence / substantiation of the claims
22:35:59 <strcat[m]> rofl
22:36:24 <strcat[m]> hard to see why anyone would be backdooring anything when that's a whole lot more effort than just exploiting the existing vulnerabilities
22:36:36 <strcat[m]> like why would you backdoor the Linux kernel when it has thousands of known, unfixed vulnerabilities that are public?
22:36:47 <strcat[m]> just pick some, develop exploits
22:36:57 <strcat[m]> or with other stuff, find vulnerabilities
22:37:06 <strcat[m]> way easier and less risky than trying to insert a backdoor, no?
22:37:24 <strcat[m]> but people want to argue about backdoors because they feel they can make it into some issue of politics / nationality
22:37:38 <strcat[m]> like this guy claims US-based company that makes SoC == clearly backdoored
22:37:49 <strcat[m]> Taiwan-based == not backdoored? why?
22:37:58 <strcat[m]> just arbitrarily decides this and claims it as fact
22:38:05 <strcat[m]> also he supports some US companies making phones
22:38:13 <strcat[m]> which going on and on about US companies backdooring stuff for the NSA
22:38:28 <strcat[m]> but yet... he likes some US company under the same laws / system subject to the same FISA orders, etc.
22:38:41 <strcat[m]> clear he is just spouting BS
22:38:42 <strcat[m]> so many people like this
22:38:48 <strcat[m]> also btw, if you want to avoid NSA backdoors
22:38:56 <strcat[m]> Apple has legal protection from NSA backdoors
22:38:59 <strcat[m]> Huawei does not
22:39:14 <strcat[m]> the NSA and even the CIA can legally infiltrate Huawei and backdoor their products
22:39:18 <strcat[m]> or sabotage the security
22:39:36 <strcat[m]> they openly do this as part of their mission really, more openly than illegal spying on US citizens
22:39:50 <strcat[m]> key part: spying on chinese people and backdooring their stuff is LEGAL for the NSA/CIA
22:40:22 <strcat[m]> spying on US citizens / companies is ILLEGAL and they just barely get away with it and have a lot of restrictions in practice
22:40:26 <strcat[m]> that's why they trade info with other countries without those restrictions
22:40:49 <strcat[m]> reddit is such a shithole
22:41:16 <strcat[m]> meanwhile none of these ppl does anything to make things better just waste time/energy of people that do and harass/attack them constantly
22:41:36 <strcat[m]> and promote products from charlatans ripping off ppl who think they're buying privacy/security
22:45:13 <mxnorvak[m]> I mean is there even a company , either from a friend or enemy company that produces smartphones with their own chip and isn't an NSA target
22:46:12 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: well I don't see how it's constructive to have this guy saying X is backdoored, Y is not, no explanation or anything
22:46:15 <mxnorvak[m]> I trust Apple and Google and Qualcomm lawyers more to protect the users by the law
22:46:43 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: he just says Qualcomm is backdoored, NXP is clean, no explanation, he just knows these things magically through telepathy
22:46:53 <strcat[m]> but objectively, Qualcomm has a more secure SoC
22:47:02 <strcat[m]> and no one has identified any backdoor
22:47:05 <strcat[m]> just conjecture
22:47:31 <strcat[m]> if people want to pick some Chinese phone that meets the requirements and work on support for that, great
22:47:53 <strcat[m]> seems useful to support a phone based totally out of a different legal system with different components, etc.
22:48:04 <strcat[m]> but how about people don't just make up BS
22:48:17 <strcat[m]> also gl finding such a phone that does not have totally trash security
22:48:45 <strcat[m]> and hypothetical backdoors ppl largely just imagine / theorize about are a lot less scary than very real vulnerabilities and security defects we can see
22:49:00 <strcat[m]> whole thing is immensely frustrating
22:49:13 <strcat[m]> extremely little help from anyone combined with people trying so hard to waste time/energy and cause problems
22:49:39 <strcat[m]> if anyone is being paid to harm security it's these scumbags spending all day harassing / harming security projects and promoting scams
22:50:10 <strcat[m]> explain to me why there are people obsessed with me posting about me daily and causing trouble for myself and GrapheneOS
22:50:33 <strcat[m]> using tons of sockpuppet accounts etc
22:50:34 <nickcalyx[m]> > also gl finding such a phone that does not have totally trash security
22:50:34 <nickcalyx[m]> That seems to be the case with xiaomi so far
22:51:03 <strcat[m]> but those are Qualcomm SoC phones you're talking about aren't they
22:51:15 <strcat[m]> I'm saying a phone using Chinese components like Kirin
22:51:51 <mxnorvak[m]> What about Exynos?
22:52:29 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: not really available to us as an option
22:53:43 <strcat[m]> anyway need help resolving these bluetooth / wired audio issues
22:55:10 <nuttso[m]> <strcat[m] "anyway need help resolving these"> Valldrac is working on the Bluetooth issue
22:55:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: need to update th"> Well after 2 hours I have managed a blank screen and no PDF display by upstreaming it
22:55:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will check the CSP
22:55:44 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "mxnorvak: not really available t"> Because of the lack of alternate OS support?
22:55:44 <hypokeimenon[m]> Isn't it only Huawei that uses Kirin
22:55:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Maybe that's the issue
22:56:00 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: largely
22:56:51 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: we could support a huawei phone but it'd have to meet the standards and not have obvious privacy/security issues
22:56:57 <strcat[m]> same standards as always
22:57:04 <strcat[m]> so someone would have to research this and find a viable target
22:57:10 <strcat[m]> and doesn't mean we'd recommend it
22:57:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> Oh apparently Honor as well
22:57:18 <strcat[m]> honor is huawei
22:57:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> I found the pdf.min.js https://github.com/mozilla/pdfjs-dist and the viewer I had to download the old release, diff the new release over it and then slowly port the patches over
22:57:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dunno why it's a white screen
22:57:50 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: there is only 1 patch for a CSP issue
22:57:56 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: what did you port over?
22:58:29 <strcat[m]> we only use pdf.js itself not their viewer samples, etc.
22:58:34 <strcat[m]> we make our own viewer
22:58:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: what did you port"> Sorry guess it's worded wrong
22:58:57 <strcat[m]> you need to grab the new release of pdf.js, put it into the sources (easier to use unminified to debug)
22:59:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oh
22:59:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> So revert the viewer changes?
22:59:15 <strcat[m]> you can build it yourself with gulp
22:59:19 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I don't know what you mean
22:59:29 <strcat[m]> grab the latest pdf.js (unminified), put into assets
22:59:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> I took the viewer changes in too
22:59:37 <strcat[m]> update the viewer to use the new API - minor changes probably
22:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oops
22:59:42 <strcat[m]> what viewer changes
22:59:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah got it
22:59:45 <strcat[m]> we don't use their viewer
22:59:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
22:59:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> My fault
23:00:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry should've asked before
23:00:02 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: update pdf.js + port our viewer to new API
23:00:10 <strcat[m]> I think we have a port to some newer version in a branch maybe
23:00:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Got it
23:00:17 <strcat[m]> maybe it's only local
23:00:24 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the API changed, some minor changes are needed
23:00:40 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: you can use adb logcat to see logs from Vanadium/Chromium WebView
23:00:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmm I'll try to find those
23:00:43 <strcat[m]> with errors
23:00:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's likely that updating will break due to CSP
23:00:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Have never done much JavaScript so it's a lot of hitting google up
23:01:12 <strcat[m]> once you update pdf.js and port to new API
23:01:13 <strcat[m]> or during that
23:01:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> So remove CSP during development?
23:01:18 <strcat[m]> you can disable setting the CSP header
23:01:19 <strcat[m]> yes
23:01:28 <strcat[m]> try getting it to work without CSP
23:01:30 <strcat[m]> port over to new API
23:01:34 <strcat[m]> then add back CSP and it prob breaks
23:01:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> So CSP header -> CSP-report-only?
23:01:38 <strcat[m]> and need to figure out where they fucked up
23:01:42 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yeah or just disable
23:02:03 <strcat[m]> a lot of these projects don't care much about avoiding dynamic code eval
23:02:24 <strcat[m]> and they use babel which likes to rewrite stuff like async/await from newer JS into dynamic code evaluation nonsense that works on older browsers
23:02:26 <strcat[m]> that's the source of most problems
23:02:30 <strcat[m]> compat nonsense
23:02:48 <strcat[m]> they solve shit with eval() or other ways to do dynamic js/css
23:02:54 <strcat[m]> compiler that turns modern js stuff -> eval
23:04:15 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just frustrating / time consuming to keep it updated
23:04:44 <strcat[m]> but really important to do it and gets harder the longer it is put off
23:04:54 <strcat[m]> and they aren't going to fix the problems themselves probably
23:05:13 <strcat[m]> at one point had a standoff with them because they got some 0.2% performance improvement from violating a sane CSS Content-Security-Policy
23:05:24 <strcat[m]> not even 0.2%
23:05:40 <strcat[m]> latest issues they said wasn't their fault cause dependencies did it
23:05:44 <strcat[m]> like 6 layers deep into layers of deps
23:05:49 <strcat[m]> I just gave up
23:06:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wow huh
23:06:19 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "like this guy claims US-based co"> And any company based in China, which is known for human rights abuses and violating privacy, is obviously not backdoored
23:06:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <madaidan[m] "And any company based in China, "> Ad hominems
23:06:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Smh
23:06:53 <madaidan[m]> His hypocrisy has no bounds
23:07:51 <strcat[m]> nuttso: I don't really understand how his change broke it anyway
23:07:57 <strcat[m]> nuttso: I don't see how it could have made things worse
23:08:04 <strcat[m]> if the order was random before
23:08:12 <strcat[m]> I guess something else might use the ordering
23:08:15 <strcat[m]> and somehow this breaks it
23:08:40 <strcat[m]> maybe I should just disable SLOT_RANDOMIZE for the bluetooth process (whatever this breaks)
23:08:45 <strcat[m]> and revert the change
23:08:48 <strcat[m]> to get this fixed for the next release
23:19:46 <spaceinfinite[m]> This room is on stereoids
23:20:18 <JTL> 16:02 <strcat[m]> and they use babel which likes to rewrite stuff like async/await from newer JS into dynamic code evaluation nonsense that works on older browsers
23:20:19 <JTL> 16:02 <strcat[m]> that's the source of most problems
23:20:21 <JTL> Somehow that doesn't surprise me
23:20:37 <spaceinfinite[m]> Imagine when userbase grows

23:21:17 <RageLtMan> 'evening all.
23:22:15 <RageLtMan> valldrac: any chance you might be able to explain the semantics behind 2a6085d5f0d828da? It looks like its suppsoed to override the same function in media/img_utils/include/img_utils/SortedEntryVector.h
23:23:18 <strcat[m]> it's overriding the sort order for DeviceDescriptor
23:24:02 <strcat[m]> the way it's doing it is apparently broken
23:24:55 <RageLtMan> Yeah, and broken might be logic, or syntax, and my C++ is rusty so might as well remember the differences from C :)
23:25:52 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: it's overriding it instead of using default ver of that function
23:25:55 <strcat[m]> dunno what it was doing before
23:26:02 <strcat[m]> so the issue is probably that this partially fixes the order but not fully
23:26:13 <strcat[m]> it screws up some part of it that worked fine before
23:26:38 <RageLtMan> yeah, so searching for the same function i only found it in that media subtree - definied or called, so digging int a bit deeper, not a simple grep i'm guessing
23:27:50 <RageLtMan> i imagine if the override application itself had scoping issues that might pop out at you given your compiler expertise? I'd miss that flat out :)
23:29:28 <strcat[m]> ok I think I need the issue
23:29:32 <strcat[m]> by default I think it compares types
23:29:39 <strcat[m]> hrmm
23:29:45 <strcat[m]> shrug I don't really get it
23:29:49 <strcat[m]> hope valldrac can figure it out
23:40:59 <strcat[m]>  * ok I think I see the issue
23:42:12 <strcat[m]> one possibility is maybe replace the equal / return 0 case
23:42:20 <strcat[m]> with calling what this overrides
23:43:00 <strcat[m]> dunno
23:45:44 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: the issue here was this stupid code was relying on the comparisons of addresses returned by malloc for correctness
23:46:15 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: so maybe it wasn't sorting entirely based on that but at least for the bluetooth stuff it would sort them by address of malloc allocations
23:46:26 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: so this is just plain broken in general but SLOT_RANDOMIZE feature made it more broken in practice
23:46:49 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: so valldrac made a patch doing an override with a deterministic order - but I think it's missing something
23:46:56 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: so this is both less and more broken
23:47:03 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: dunno exactly what's wrong with it
23:47:18 <strcat[m]> RageLtMan: I guess the issue is it's treating stuff as equal that was previously ordered by type or w/e
23:47:27 <strcat[m]> or this sort order is sometimes not right
23:47:28 <strcat[m]> I don't know
23:47:41 <strcat[m]> I could try a shot in the dark but I can't test it myself
23:47:45 <strcat[m]> and it takes a day to do a release to get others to test
23:53:08 <valldrac> I think ordering the vector by type is wrong. Maybe ordering my insertion order is the correct answer. I have to check what’s the actual order in stock Android, and if the order change over time after boot
23:54:05 <valldrac> I have more ideas. But I will test this one first tomorrow
23:55:26 <strcat[m]> if they use insertion order it's weird to use a sorted vector type
23:55:27 <strcat[m]> at all
23:56:52 <strcat[m]> well maybe I should revert it then for now
23:56:53 <strcat[m]> dunno
23:57:25 <valldrac> They deprecated this type is master, and they are not using it anymore. I guess because they realize is broken if you don’t provide a comparison method
