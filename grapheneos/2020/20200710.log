00:00:27 <qyo3462572445[m]> It isn't a money issue. Especially with the new SE being $399. I think that's a good price for a phone.
00:02:01 <qyo3462572445[m]> Right, but my pixel does everything I need it to. That's the difference. If GrapheneOS didn't fit my need, I wouldn't be using it. I don't use it only because its safer overall, I use it because its safer and it let's me do everything I need.
00:02:16 <cn3m[m]> yes, iPhone SE with the fastest chip you can get in a phone, premium build, wireless charging, 5-7 years of support. It is a good deal
00:03:04 <cn3m[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "Right, but my pixel does everyth"> That is fair, yes it depends on what you do
00:05:02 <alzxjm[m]> I wish the screen were bigger.
00:05:51 <rover1[m]> alzxjm: theres 3a xl
00:08:09 <alzxjm[m]> No I mean the iPhone SE.
00:09:36 <rover1[m]> usb c, headphone jack, smaller bezel
00:10:07 <rover1[m]> features se lacking
00:11:03 <alzxjm[m]> I have a Pixel 4 XL. I like giant screens and phones.
00:14:15 <qyo3462572445[m]> Believe me, I get safer. I'm not arguing against that, but people need to take responsibly for their own cyber security. Learn the tech. Learn basic do's and don'ts. Don't click random links. Don't install random apps. iPhones are limited by design. Some people are OK with that. Others, not so much.
00:15:42 <alzxjm[m]> Are iPhones more limited than Graphene? I'm genuinely asking, I haven't had an iPhone for like 6 years.
00:17:08 <qyo3462572445[m]> Depending on what you want to do I guess. I don't like that I need to sign up for an account to download apps from the app store. Side loading and alternative app stores on android are a huge plus for me.
00:17:21 <alzxjm[m]> I think the recommendations here are to use the software shipped with the OS (Vanadium, Graphene keyboard) rather than installing 3rd party apps.
00:17:52 <qyo3462572445[m]> I also like not having any google play services (or apple connections obviously ) too.
00:18:08 <hypokeimenon[m]> trust issues
00:18:15 <alzxjm[m]> I.e. ideal Graphene security can be functionally as locked down as iOS, though you are obviously free to install anything you want anyway.
00:18:30 <qyo3462572445[m]> Sure, but again, android (grapheneos) gives you the choice to install apps if you want them
00:18:46 <geritol[m]> alzxjm: iPhone XR is going pretty affordable used or refurbished.
00:20:03 <qyo3462572445[m]> Plus, there's a few apps I enjoy using that aren't available on iOS due to apple controlling the app store.
00:21:27 <qyo3462572445[m]> But that isn't so much a grapheneOS vs iOS thing. Its more of an android in general vs iOS.
00:21:44 <cn3m[m]> qyo3462572445: sideload?
00:22:26 <cn3m[m]> Yes, the one app I have on my GrapheneOS that is very cool and not friendly on iOS is Dolphin due to dynamic native code execution
00:24:44 <qyo3462572445[m]> Newpipe is a big one for me, and Conversations
00:27:18 <cn3m[m]> https://xmpp.org/software/clients.html 7 iOS clients for XMPP. I tend to just use invidio.us and rss on iOS and Android. I am trying to lessen reliance on F-Droid
00:28:06 <nitroneurons[m]1> people still use xmpp?
00:28:14 <jcpicard32[m]> Only F-Droid apps I have rn are Newpipe, Orbot (Guardian repo), Bromite and KPDX
00:28:27 <jcpicard32[m]> Granted I don't have too many apps in general
00:30:22 <jcpicard32[m]>  * Only F-Droid apps I have rn are Newpipe, Orbot (Guardian repo), OpenCamera, Bromite and KPDX
00:32:57 <qyo3462572445[m]> I think more people should use xmpp personally. And can you use RSS on iOS and android for audio only? And I've tried iOS xmpp clients. The background connection limitation of iOS ruins xmpp
00:36:02 <jcpicard32[m]> I would probably use XMPP if I knew anyone who used it. I had a hard enough time switching people I talk to over to Signal
00:38:03 <cn3m[m]> <qyo3462572445[m] "I think more people should use x"> yeah I just go to an instance with audio downloads
00:38:05 <nitroneurons[m]1> I agree, it's my favourite chat system. But I only have one contact
00:38:14 <cn3m[m]> I use audio only download on Android too for the consistency
00:38:16 <nitroneurons[m]1> Had none for most of the past several years
00:38:21 <nitroneurons[m]1> thought it was mostly abandoned
00:40:11 <cn3m[m]> You know you guys can use XMPP with Matrix right?
00:40:12 <cn3m[m]> PTIO at least
00:40:14 <nitroneurons[m]1> yeah
00:41:24 <jonah__> Well it’s just like a bridge. In same same sense you can use Discord and Telegram with Matrix, right?
00:41:25 <qyo3462572445[m]> I have a few contacts on it.
00:43:55 <qyo3462572445[m]> I can't recommend xmpp to iOS users though and since most of my contacts use iOS, we just use signal
00:57:36 <cn3m[m]> qyo3462572445: I just linked 9 clients for xmpp on iOS
01:12:23 <qyo3462572445[m]> And none work as well as on android.
01:13:09 <qyo3462572445[m]> I've tried the big ones. I know two are working on issues but right now, the experience isn't that smooth
01:16:53 <qyo3462572445[m]> No use in trying to get people to switch to a messaging platform that doesn't have the usability people on ios are use to. Most of the people I know on iOS aren't tech savvy.
01:31:19 <odisaben[m]> pleasehelp12: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg
01:31:48 <odisaben[m]> This is the video I used. Pretty good step by step
01:32:18 <qyo3462572445[m]> Nothing is "wrong" with them. Just prefer xmpp to matrix. And I do use signal, but it requires a phone number and its centralized. Plus, PTIO is just a site, its not a be all end all.
01:33:24 <qyo3462572445[m]> Not everything they recommend is Gospel.
01:34:24 <odisaben[m]> pleasehelp12: just make sure you get the file specific to your device
01:34:58 <geritol[m]> Yeah don't use anything but the official guide that's what the subreddit says
01:35:10 <odisaben[m]> What system are you using to do it?
01:35:56 <odisaben[m]> There is a step by step guide for that as well
01:37:42 <odisaben[m]> I haven't used Windows in almost 7yrs. I cant speak for that.
01:38:29 <odisaben[m]> That's possible the process should be similar between the two, just different commands?
01:41:01 <jcpicard32[m]> pleasehelp12: First things first, are you using the official version of Fastboot from Google linked on the install page?
01:41:14 <jcpicard32[m]> If not DO NOT go any further without uninstalling what you have and installing that one
01:41:18 <jcpicard32[m]> It could brick your device
01:42:18 <jcpicard32[m]> Don't use that
01:42:43 <jcpicard32[m]> Uninstall it and then install the official one from https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
01:43:56 <jcpicard32[m]> No problem. Make sure to follow the official guide at https://grapheneos.org/install
01:44:02 <jcpicard32[m]> Let us know if you have any questions
01:47:17 <jcpicard32[m]> So first open a Powershell with admin privileges. Don't use the legacy command prompt or you'll run into issues
01:47:55 <jcpicard32[m]> Hit Windows + X and then click it in the menu that comes up
01:48:24 <BeingFrey[m]> Hello everyone!  Q: is there any custom ROM that would work with a Verizon Pixel 2XL?
01:51:25 <jcpicard32[m]> Did you run the first curl to download, verify and extract platform tools?
01:52:32 <jcpicard32[m]> Okay
01:52:44 <jcpicard32[m]> We should be able to add a PATH variable through the GUI too
01:52:55 <jcpicard32[m]> Give me a sec to refresh myself on how to do this
01:53:13 <jcpicard32[m]> No worries!
01:53:22 <jcpicard32[m]> I'm here if you run into trouble
01:57:41 <jcpicard32[m]> That's fine. Just a sec I'll look into it now
02:04:21 <jcpicard32[m]> Hey sorry I just got back. Taking a looksie
02:04:58 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: do you know where i can find the OTA for Android 11 (RPB2.200611.009) by any chance?
02:06:56 <aeonsolution[m]> im coming up empty but there is one somewhere to update phones using Android 11 version 1 or 1.5
02:07:00 <aeonsolution[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/hnkwcq/android_11_beta_2_now_available/
02:08:19 <jcpicard32[m]> pleasehelp12: I'm not exactly sure what's causing that. It should work fine. Have you rebooted and tried again?
02:08:32 <cn3m[m]> https://developer.android.com/preview/get
02:08:59 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah
02:11:13 <jcpicard32[m]> You should't need anything special set up. I do think that will take care of it though. I tried to reproduce this on my desktop and couldn't so my first thought was try that
02:11:29 <jcpicard32[m]> Btw sorry if it takes me a little while. It's my first time walking someone through install
02:11:37 <jcpicard32[m]> Usually TheJollyRoger does these sort of things
02:12:17 <aeonsolution[m]> you're doing great jcpicard32
02:12:32 <aeonsolution[m]> just poweroff pleasehelp12 and go into the bootloader
02:12:59 <aeonsolution[m]> if it didnt flash correctly, it might not start the OS
02:13:03 <aeonsolution[m]> which is fine
02:13:12 <aeonsolution[m]> you can always start over
02:13:47 <aeonsolution[m]> if you followed any advice that was not prescribed on the GOS website https://grapheneos.org/
02:14:10 <aeonsolution[m]> you will be making it extremely difficult for anyone to help you troubleshoot
02:15:28 <aeonsolution[m]> the biggest obstacle most windows users go through is the fastboot part
02:15:56 <aeonsolution[m]> setting the path plus opening and closing powershell windows
02:16:13 <odisaben[m]> Agreed Linux ftw
02:16:33 <aeonsolution[m]> which kills the path that would call the correct version of fastboot
02:16:45 <jcpicard32[m]> <pleasehelp12[m] "wait, what am I doing?"> In Windows, or on your phone?
02:17:23 <jcpicard32[m]> So in Windows the first thing to do is get Fastboot working, which is probably the hardest part of the install. Try running the curl thing again now that you've rebooted
02:18:02 <jcpicard32[m]> Should be at https://grapheneos.org/install
02:18:04 <jcpicard32[m]> One sec
02:18:21 * jcpicard32[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oHedRVcbYiTPxcZcBvMSAOmW >
02:18:45 <aeonsolution[m]> Powershell
02:18:50 <jcpicard32[m]> Through PowerShell with admin priviliges
02:18:59 <aeonsolution[m]> the instructions at the top explain why
02:19:13 <aeonsolution[m]> please read it over at least once
02:19:58 <aeonsolution[m]> you don't have to be tech literate and don't sell yourself short
02:20:36 <aeonsolution[m]> just follow the instructions, if something is hard or you're not understanding; its ok to take a break
02:20:45 <odisaben[m]> pleasehelp12: everyone starts as a noob man. No shame in it....just keep trying. Its worth it
02:21:09 <aeonsolution[m]> ok so the error you see
02:21:17 <aeonsolution[m]> is because you needed to reset the path again
02:21:32 <aeonsolution[m]> to set the path again*
02:21:56 <aeonsolution[m]> On Windows:
02:21:56 <aeonsolution[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
02:22:07 <aeonsolution[m]> thats the right on
02:22:13 <aeonsolution[m]> one*
02:22:25 <jcpicard32[m]> That's it
02:22:29 <jcpicard32[m]> That should fix it
02:25:32 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to unzip the folder
02:26:24 <aeonsolution[m]> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows.zip
02:31:39 <aeonsolution[m]> ok
02:31:45 <aeonsolution[m]> close powershell
02:31:53 <aeonsolution[m]> and delete anything you downloaded
02:32:07 <aeonsolution[m]> open up powershell as an admin again
02:32:15 <aeonsolution[m]> and run this command
02:32:22 <aeonsolution[m]> `cd $HOME\Downloads\`
02:32:44 <aeonsolution[m]> let me know if there are errors
02:34:13 <aeonsolution[m]> ok run these commands that jcpicard32 asked you too
02:34:31 <aeonsolution[m]> `curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows.zip`
02:34:47 <aeonsolution[m]> `(Get-FileHash platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows.zip).hash -eq "5c8fb6d72da581baa608a38853d05aeeaf920f2ac9ca2cb463d9fd62acb0871b"`
02:34:57 <aeonsolution[m]> `tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows.zip`
02:35:27 <aeonsolution[m]> the second command should be all in one line in your powershell session
02:37:54 <jcpicard32[m]> Excellent. That sounds about like what should happen
02:38:07 <jcpicard32[m]> Next thing is to run the next line
02:38:08 <jcpicard32[m]> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
02:38:59 <jcpicard32[m]> So we can add PlatformTools to our PATH
02:39:08 <jcpicard32[m]> You did? Cool
02:39:28 <jcpicard32[m]> Quick sanity check. What happens if you type "fastboot --version" without the quotation marks?
02:39:54 <jcpicard32[m]> Perfect
02:40:10 <jcpicard32[m]> Believe it or not that's the hardest part of the install done
02:40:49 <jcpicard32[m]> You said you have the bootloader unlocked on your phone already?
02:41:58 <jcpicard32[m]> Sweet. Since we're on Windows there isn't really a good way to get a copy of Signify from a trusted source, so it's fine to skip it
02:42:23 <jcpicard32[m]> Since you have the bootloader unlocked we'll skip to the "Obtaining Factory Images" section
02:42:56 <jcpicard32[m]> I believe so
02:43:33 <jcpicard32[m]> You can do either. It's probably slightly cleaner to do the command line but either should work
02:46:01 <aeonsolution[m]> curl on windows has to be invoked as curl.exe
02:46:18 <aeonsolution[m]> the page explains why
02:50:00 <fomijafi[m]> For those of you using xmpp on graphene curious to hear which clients you like
02:50:34 <fomijafi[m]> Been using conversations but its a little ugly (vain I know)
02:50:49 <jcpicard32[m]> pleasehelp12: No problem. Let us know when it's done
02:52:05 <dolores0[m]> ill be flashing my phone as well in an hour, looking forward to it! <3
02:52:59 <jcpicard32[m]> dolores0: Awesome! Let us know if you have any issues!
03:00:25 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah you should be good to run that with the corrected name
03:01:10 <jcpicard32[m]> No worries. I believe that's what you want
03:01:23 <jcpicard32[m]> Now run the next one
03:01:24 <jcpicard32[m]> cd crosshatch-factory-2020.05.05.02
03:01:41 <jcpicard32[m]> Which will move your Powershell section into to that directory
03:01:50 <jcpicard32[m]> But with the correct name or course
03:03:18 <jcpicard32[m]> No .zip this time
03:03:55 <jcpicard32[m]> Now run ./flash-all.bat
03:03:58 <jcpicard32[m]> in Powershell
03:05:19 <jcpicard32[m]> At fastbootd?
03:05:30 <jcpicard32[m]> If things are still running in your powershell wait for them to finish
03:05:36 <jcpicard32[m]> I had to wait several minutes after when I did it
03:07:40 <jcpicard32[m]> As soon as it's done you
03:07:45 <jcpicard32[m]> You'll relock the bootloader
03:08:03 <jcpicard32[m]> No problem! Happy to help
03:08:13 <jcpicard32[m]> Correct
03:08:17 <f8sai[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "No problem! Happy to help"> Congrats
03:08:21 <f8sai[m]> <pleasehelp12[m] "thank you so much!"> Congrats
03:08:49 <jcpicard32[m]> If you see the yellow warning saying your device is loading a different operating system that's normal and means everything is good, so don't worry about that
03:09:24 <f8sai[m]> Don't forget the fastboot flashing lock
03:10:20 <jcpicard32[m]> pleasehelp12: I wouldn't recommend it if this is going to be your daily driver
03:10:48 <jcpicard32[m]> Yeah you should be good to unplug
03:11:10 <jcpicard32[m]> No problem. Happy to help!
03:16:00 <anne232> maybe im making assumptions too early, but i have my pixel 3a on fastboot mode, have it plugged in via usb, ran 'fastboot flashing unlock' says waiting for any device
03:16:06 <anne232> what gives lmao
03:16:23 <jcpicard32[m]> pleasehelp12: Updates should come over the air automatically when they're available
03:16:33 <anne232> been doing this for a few mins, does this mean that fastboot doesnt recognize my device
03:16:50 <jcpicard32[m]> It will do what's called a delta update, so it will only install the stuff that's changed to save on bandwidth
03:17:06 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: Sounds like it may not. Where in the guide have you gotten to?
03:17:12 <anne232> welp, I ran  'adb devies', nothing,
03:17:15 <anne232> devices*
03:17:23 <anne232> and Im at the "unlocking the bootloader" part
03:17:43 <anne232> does it matter that im using a usb-c to usb-c cable?
03:17:44 <jcpicard32[m]> Before we continue, what happens when you type "fastboot --version" into your shell?
03:17:47 <jcpicard32[m]> without the quotes?
03:18:07 <anne232> I already did this earlier, but it says its 30.0.3
03:18:22 <jcpicard32[m]> <anne232 "does it matter that im using a u"> I did this, but other people have had better luck with a usb a to usb c. If you can use one it may be worth trying
03:18:39 <anne232> I can, Ill try it.
03:18:49 <jcpicard32[m]> Did you add your platform tools to your path?
03:18:52 <odisaben[m]> pleasehelp12: updates are ota just like a regular device.
03:19:18 <anne232> when i run that version command, it says installed at /home/user/adb-fastboot/platform-tools/fastboot
03:19:39 <anne232> im pretty much strictly following the guide here
03:19:52 <jcpicard32[m]> You're using the version of fastboot linked in the guide, right?
03:20:58 <anne232> im using the version taht i installed previously for other purposes, but there is not one linked in the guide.
03:22:48 <anne232> this doesnt make sense ugh
03:22:55 <anne232> tried with a normal usb, same shit
03:23:01 <anne232> the phone shows up on lsusb, also
03:23:47 <jcpicard32[m]> anne232: There is one linked in the guuide
03:23:50 <jcpicard32[m]> Reread https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
03:23:58 <anne232> nothing is linked there.
03:24:08 <jcpicard32[m]> You should run the curl command to get the version from https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
03:25:07 <anne232> actually thats basicall ywhee I got it from.
03:25:12 <anne232> Oh wait.
03:25:14 <anne232> Hang on.
03:25:41 <anne232> i got it from
03:25:48 <anne232> dl.google.com/android/repository/file.zip
03:26:14 <anne232> was called like platform-tools or soemthing,
03:26:25 <anne232> I guess ill download the android.com one, but I feel like its gonna be the same?
03:26:58 <jcpicard32[m]> I'm confused. Are you using that version or are you using the version you downloaded previously for other things?
03:27:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> anne232: you probably don't have udev rules
03:28:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Try running the commands with sudo
03:28:04 <anne232> im using the version I downloaded for other stuff, but it's still the current version from a google.com download
03:28:07 <anne232> Okay.
03:28:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just run sudo fastboot devices
03:29:03 <anne232> now its saying command not found wtf
03:29:09 <anne232> when i run sudo fastboot devices
03:29:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well
03:29:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use a shell that expands before running the command like zsh
03:29:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> sudo $(which fastboot) devices
03:30:37 <anne232> it outputs with
03:30:59 <anne232> a mix of numbers and fastboot
03:30:59 <anne232> like
03:31:08 <anne232> 90390H34F2 fastboot
03:31:10 <anne232> as an example
03:31:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Good
03:31:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> That means your udev rules aren't set up
03:31:34 <anne232> ugh
03:31:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should be able to run the flash script as root
03:31:53 <anne232> should I just su ?
03:32:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or install udev rules
03:32:16 <anne232> wtf
03:32:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
03:32:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well install udev rules
03:32:27 <anne232> i run fastboot as root it says its not installed.
03:32:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> That would be ideal
03:32:35 <anne232> but i was literally using the command 5-10 mins ago
03:32:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because you didn't edit your PATH
03:33:57 <anne232> lol yeah ok fixed now
03:34:17 <anne232> adb devices interestingly comes up with nothignm still
03:34:23 <anne232> but alright ui think I can go from here probbaly
03:34:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why would it?
03:35:13 <anne232> oh yaeh true lmfao
03:35:19 <anne232> i jsut associate the two apps
03:36:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> You are in fastboot
03:36:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pleasehelp12[m] "and once I load in I should turn"> Yes
03:38:56 <jcpicard32[m]> <pleasehelp12[m] "reddit is talking about signal n"> Works fine. Because there are no play services, it will have to run in the background constantly. This will affect battery unless you disable the battery optimizations for Signal, but it will run just fine. I run it myself
03:39:22 <dolores0[m]> hahhhhhh, i lost before i could even begin. my usb a to usb c cable is not compatible i think, cant get a proper connection from phone to pc
03:39:24 <anne232> wtf
03:39:28 <anne232> trying to unzip crosshatch
03:39:33 <anne232> end of central directory signature not found
03:39:39 <anne232> But I literally just downloaded that shit
03:39:41 <anne232> :/
03:41:20 <f8sai[m]> Not really, it works just fine
03:41:31 <aeonsolution[m]> anne232: use tab complete
03:41:53 <aeonsolution[m]> you probably pasted or typed the command incorrectly
03:42:10 <anne232> nope
03:42:11 <anne232> same result
03:42:20 <anne232> Ishould mention, that signify gave me an error too.
03:42:21 <f8sai[m]> signal.org/android/apk
03:42:31 <jcpicard32[m]> pleasehelp12: Two options. There's the aurora store that lets you access the play store through an anonymous account
03:42:39 <jcpicard32[m]> Or you can download from the link@f8sai:privacytools.io:  put agove
03:42:45 <jcpicard32[m]> Either should work fine
03:42:50 <jcpicard32[m]>  * Or you can download from the link@f8sai:privacytools.io:  put above
03:42:51 <anne232> If im being honest, even though im a paranoid and security midned person, I've never really been the type to feel the need to verify the files I download with the developers signing key, lol
03:43:15 <jcpicard32[m]> Ah they may have taken that down then
03:43:20 <jcpicard32[m]> Do you have F-droid installed?
03:43:28 <f8sai[m]> Swipe down
03:43:48 <aeonsolution[m]> anne232: im confused, what are you trying to do
03:43:56 <anne232> im literally just putting in the commands
03:43:59 <anne232> that the guide tells me to
03:44:18 <anne232> im at flashign factory images right now
03:44:20 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, but what step are you in
03:44:23 <anne232> where you unzip crosshatcfh-factory
03:44:32 <aeonsolution[m]> did everything before that work?
03:44:41 <anne232> Signify did somethign weird.
03:45:07 <aeonsolution[m]> are you on linux or windows
03:45:11 <anne232> linux
03:45:26 <aeonsolution[m]> you probably didnt download all the files properly
03:45:42 <anne232> I have word for word copied everything the guide has told me
03:46:03 <aeonsolution[m]> sure, but if you had a network connection issue
03:46:05 <anne232> i mean, its only 3 files, a .zip, a .pub and a .sig, yes?
03:46:23 <aeonsolution[m]> it could of caused the problem
03:46:26 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
03:46:33 <anne232> signify said something like
03:46:48 <anne232> must start with untrusted comment
03:46:54 <anne232> bit i figured that didnt really matter
03:47:11 <anne232> especially considering that .pub file does in fact start with that
03:47:26 <aeonsolution[m]> thats what the file says
03:47:32 <aeonsolution[m]> its in the instructions page
03:48:23 <aeonsolution[m]> when you run the signify command it should spit out `verified`
03:48:31 <aeonsolution[m]> if everything is cleared
03:51:52 <aeonsolution[m]> if you end up closing your terminal before continuing and open a new shell without adding the PATH again
03:52:06 <aeonsolution[m]> you won't be able to continue
03:53:27 <aeonsolution[m]> the script will error out because it cant find `fastboot`
03:54:06 <aeonsolution[m]> a lot of people follow the steps but also add extra steps that mess up the install process
03:54:32 <aeonsolution[m]> which is fine, it happens so don't feel bad about it
03:55:22 <aeonsolution[m]> but leaving that information out when people are helping you troubleshoot just makes finding the issue more difficult
03:56:28 <anne232> i havent added any extra steps
03:56:48 <anne232> i would copypaste and show u but its on a diff machine
04:17:34 <anne232> wtf happened to freenode lmao
05:07:26 <strcat[m]> btw I'm no longer going to be recommending Signal due to the recent issues tied to their increasing reliance on SGX and the way they've misrepresented their PIN changes
05:07:47 <strcat[m]> the registration lock PIN was replaced with a new PIN covering that along with implementing a form of remote backup/sync for contacts, profile, etc. (not messages or keys)
05:08:20 <strcat[m]> it encourages using a weak PIN rather than a strong passphrase and doesn't support a strong key generated by the app, so even if people use a passphrase they're likely to have an insecure one that can be cracked
05:08:24 <strcat[m]> and they rely on SGX to make it 'secure'
05:08:43 <strcat[m]> but the main issue with this is their response to the controversy
05:08:49 <strcat[m]> they have handled the criticism / suggestions really badly
05:09:01 <strcat[m]> they've downplayed the problems and have ignored a lot of valid criticism that was raised
05:09:15 <strcat[m]> and they've misrepresented the criticism and made a bunch of false claims / misrepresentations
05:09:25 <strcat[m]> I'm not going to support an app which doesn't have trustworthy/honest developers behind it
05:09:34 <strcat[m]> the feature is designed as a dark pattern
05:09:47 <strcat[m]> they've misled users about it from the start and are doubling down on that with various false claims / misrepresentations
05:10:15 <strcat[m]> I've disagreed with decisions Signal has made in the past but I've always seen reasonable reasons for what they've done and their arguments have held up to scrutiny
05:10:17 <strcat[m]> not anymore
05:10:31 <strcat[m]> I don't have a messaging app to recommend at the moment, they're all too problematic
05:11:09 <strcat[m]> but worth noting I can't recommend Signal anymore, and their addition of the option to opt out of using the PIN feature doesn't address the problems they've created and how they've responded to criticism about it
05:11:26 <strcat[m]> they slowly made the feature more and more mandatory and ignored criticism until after they'd removed the option to avoid it
05:11:36 <strcat[m]> and they aren't addressing the fundamental issues with it
05:11:54 <strcat[m]> the SGX nonsense is a serious problem too
05:12:24 <strcat[m]> you pretend using SGX on a server to implement limitsand pretend that's equivalent to strong encryption
05:13:17 <strcat[m]>  * using SGX to implement limits is not comparable to strong end-to-end encryption and it's very concerning how they're portraying it and using it to justify using a weak PIN for encryption
05:14:28 <strcat[m]> in particular since SGX is a bad implementation of that feature but really relying on a secure enclave with attestation based on a root of trust seems crazy to me
05:14:53 <strcat[m]> you know how Auditor considers the initial pairing to be a weak one?
05:14:53 <anne232> can you elaborate on what you mean by this SGX strcat[m]
05:15:08 <anne232> I've used Signal for years and there are a lot of practical sues for it.
05:15:12 <strcat[m]> SGX is a crappy secure enclave with remote attestation for itself on Intel CPUs
05:15:19 <anne232> But can someone help me continue installing graphene now that freenode is back up? lol
05:15:35 <strcat[m]> anne232: I'm well aware of what Signal is and have used and recommended it for a long time but I can no longer recommend it
05:15:38 <strcat[m]> as I explained above
05:15:39 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote
05:15:51 <anne232> I just dont feel like i entirely understand the reasoning.
05:15:57 <anne232> the signal protocol is very good afaik
05:15:58 <strcat[m]> the developers aren't trustworthy and I don't have faith in them anymore
05:16:00 <anne232> Im not cryptographist
05:16:04 <strcat[m]> because they're dishonest
05:16:07 <anne232> the developers arent trustworthy? lol
05:16:13 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote
05:16:24 <anne232> its open source & im p sure some of the devs have been involved in the radical activist scene for ages
05:16:30 <f8sai[m]> And I was just about to convince them on Signal. Nevermind, time to move
05:16:32 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote
05:16:47 <anne232> ill read it in a minute, sort of busy rn
05:16:52 <alicebobandeve[m> The developers aren't trustworthy is a bold claim strcat
05:16:54 <f8sai[m]> <anne232 "the signal protocol is very good"> Not really the problem, it's the PIN implementation and forced contact sync (and insecure SGX implementation)
05:17:03 <strcat[m]> alicebobandeve: I don't think that's a bold claim
05:17:15 <anne232> forced contact sync?
05:17:19 <strcat[m]> moxie has spent the past couple weeks repeatedly making false claims about this feature
05:17:23 <strcat[m]> and misrepresenting what critics have said about it
05:17:26 <anne232> Im pretty sure its not forced, but even if it was, its local, right? its not like it records contacts on the server.
05:17:34 <strcat[m]> including people who support the app but criticize how they're implemented this
05:17:39 <anne232> As for the PIN implementation, are you talking about the registration lock pin?
05:17:41 <strcat[m]> anne232: no, you need to read what I wrote
05:17:48 <anne232> okay, like I said, I will in a few.
05:17:51 <anne232> I wont speak until i have.
05:18:12 <strcat[m]> shouldn't have responded and tried to arguing without reading what I wrote in the first place
05:18:26 <anne232> I skimmed over it a bit. I wouldn't call it an arguent, moreso a questionaire.
05:18:55 <f8sai[m]> <anne232 "Im pretty sure its not forced, b"> it was, but not now
05:18:56 <anne232> its just that
05:19:00 <strcat[m]> it's not a lot to read and you should just read it
05:19:04 <strcat[m]> before writing a response
05:19:07 <anne232> okay i wil
05:19:10 <anne232> its just
05:19:14 <anne232> signal has kept me and many others out of jail
05:19:15 <strcat[m]> read
05:19:44 <strcat[m]> as I said I can no longer recommend Signal, I'm retracting my existing recommendation of using it
05:20:00 <strcat[m]> I don't have a chat client to recommend right now
05:20:01 <strcat[m]> as I said above
05:20:06 <strcat[m]> and I suggest reading it because I explained the reasoning
05:20:36 <strcat[m]> since people have trouble doing that
05:20:41 <strcat[m]> > btw I'm no longer going to be recommending Signal due to the recent issues tied to their increasing reliance on SGX and the way they've misrepresented their PIN changes

05:20:55 <alicebobandeve[m> strcat I agree they didn't handle the situation well enough but I think they are pretty trustworthy unless someone has a better solution for their issues
05:20:57 <strcat[m]> > but the main issue with this is their response to the controversy

05:21:13 <anne232> aye, alicebobandeve[m
05:21:13 <strcat[m]> > the feature is designed as a dark pattern
05:21:17 <strcat[m]> > they've misled users about it from the start and are doubling down on that with various false claims / misrepresentations
05:21:21 <anne232> yaeh, I'm reading it now. and like
05:21:21 <strcat[m]> > I've disagreed with decisions Signal has made in the past but I've always seen reasonable reasons for what they've done and their arguments have held up to scrutiny
05:21:50 <f8sai[m]> We don't have better options, let me guess?
05:21:53 <anne232> dont take this the wrong way, I dont wanna seem like an ass. but I really dont quite understand what that adds to the conversation. i think I need some context here.
05:22:08 <strcat[m]> anne232: doesn't seem like you're reading through what I wrote
05:22:10 <strcat[m]> finish reading through it
05:23:11 <anne232> What is the controversy? tell more about this pin implementation thing, the SGX, what false claims/misrepresentations did they make? what is this about the remove sync of contacts?
05:23:15 <anne232> I did finish reading it.
05:23:26 <anne232> Justc like I said, I just don't quite understand it.
05:23:43 <strcat[m]> anne232: read through the thread at https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1281435834059718656 including reading the threads I linked
05:23:49 <anne232> like I think i just need more context, so that even if i disagree w/ what you're saying that I can atleast understasnd what you mean
05:23:54 <strcat[m]> and read @moxie's recent thread about this
05:23:55 <anne232> oh
05:23:57 <strcat[m]> and I think you will understand
05:24:05 <anne232> I may not have been i nthe IRC at the time. my internet went down for afew
05:24:30 <f8sai[m]> Since I read about their history, it had felt like that moxie wasn't particularly trustworthy and accepting criticisms in the past (can't fork without own servers, didn't remove hard dependencies on gms/gsf until a fork did it and asked to take it down, and now this SGX insecurity)
05:24:48 <f8sai[m]> That's three strikes
05:24:48 <anne232> moxie is cool, from what ive heard?
05:25:21 <anne232> I mean idk anything about this personally but ive just seen ppl in the activist scene say they consider him trustworthy and such
05:25:24 <anne232> But let me check this out.
05:26:02 <strcat[m]> @f8sai:privacytools.io: as I said above
05:26:04 <strcat[m]> and on twitter
05:26:20 <strcat[m]> the main issue is not this badly designed PIN dark pattern
05:26:31 <strcat[m]> the issue is their response
05:26:43 <strcat[m]> rejecting the valid criticism and portraying it as if they just know better
05:26:49 <anne232> btw why are all mesasging apps problematic as you said?
05:26:52 <strcat[m]> and repeating false statements about it to justify it
05:26:57 <anne232> What about Briar? or Omemo w/ jabber?
05:27:11 <strcat[m]> and not responding to people like myself who ask questions about what they're saying or point out something isn't true
05:27:25 <f8sai[m]> Yeah, will read that. Just did a little reading yesterday
05:27:25 <f8sai[m]> (Not too surprised in their response)
05:27:58 <strcat[m]> read through https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1281435834059718656
05:28:02 <strcat[m]> look at the tweets I link
05:28:07 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1277777722916442113
05:28:07 <anne232> i jsut think what made signal so good was that it makes encryption accessible to the average person. Of course, it's not difficult to install Matrix, or a jabber client with Omemo, but its more easy to convince someone who just wants to buy weed to download signal and set it up in 30 seconds than to make an entire account on matrix/jabber/etc
05:28:10 <strcat[m]> the first one I link
05:28:32 <strcat[m]> where I asked why this feature would be required to support usernames and what would be wrong with letting people just do local backups, or choose not to do backups
05:28:50 <strcat[m]> or do strongly encrypted backups via the service of their choice using the existing backup feature
05:29:16 <strcat[m]> why would usernames require them to support remote sync based around a user-selected credential where users are encouraged to choose a weak PIN? the logic doesn't follow
05:29:26 <strcat[m]> he keeps saying this is required to support usernames instead of just phone numbers
05:29:56 <strcat[m]> and his justification for that is since they can't use the profile's contacts for it, they HAVE to do it via a remote sync mechanism where people are encouraged to use a weak PIN
05:30:20 <strcat[m]> do you see the problem with what he's claiming?
05:31:22 <strcat[m]> he didn't respond to my question despite being quite active in that thread
05:31:39 <strcat[m]> https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1277812708826546176
05:31:41 <strcat[m]> next up
05:32:05 <strcat[m]> making false claims about how storage works on those OSes and falsely claiming the ability to do the previous backup approach with strong encryption is going away
05:32:07 <strcat[m]> which is not true
05:32:16 <strcat[m]> again, didn't respond to what I said, and keeps making that false claim
05:32:42 <strcat[m]> do you see the problem with making an incorrect / false claim, which is pointed out as such, and then repeatedly making it to push something?
05:34:11 <strcat[m]> it's surprising that an experienced Android developer wouldn't understand how storage works, but I responded to it as a genuine misunderstanding about how it works and about what's changing
05:34:27 <strcat[m]> but he ignored that and kept making that inaccurate claim
05:34:35 <strcat[m]> do you see the problem?
05:34:39 <strcat[m]> look at his most recent thread
05:34:46 <strcat[m]> look how he portrays the criticism / arguments against what they did
05:35:11 <strcat[m]> makes it seem like they're just approaching it from a different perspective focused on the average user and usability when that's not the issue at all
05:36:29 <strcat[m]> how can I recommend an app from developers that won't acknowledge valid criticism and keep making false claims / misrepresentations of what's being said to distract from it?
05:36:46 <strcat[m]>  * how can I recommend an app from developers that won't acknowledge valid criticism and keep making false claims to distract from it along with misrepresenting the criticism?
05:37:51 <strcat[m]> until recently, Signal was what I recommended, because although there are other apps implementing the Signal protocol and despite the fact that it's based around phone numbers (for now), they previously always took an approach to designing the messaging system that was very privacy centric and avoided trusting the server
05:38:11 <strcat[m]> even for things like profiles, which were designed to be encrypted and not available to people that aren't your contacts
05:38:40 <strcat[m]> but now that's changing, they're doubling down on using SGX and forced people to set a PIN which they didn't accurately / openly describe to users
05:38:47 <strcat[m]> they didn't say hey we're going to start syncing stuff to our server using this PIN to encrypt it
05:39:08 <strcat[m]> it does not properly describe what it does and they slowly changed it to encourage then strongly push / force people to use it
05:39:20 <strcat[m]> finally removing the option to not set it to enable remote backup/sync of profiles, contacts, etc.
05:39:33 <strcat[m]> also, this PIN was previously the registration lock PIN - that got gobbled up and turned into this
05:39:54 <strcat[m]> it is no longer possible to set just a registration lock PIN and existing guides encouraged people to set that, and what they turned it into is much different
05:40:07 <strcat[m]> they did this in a way that's a dark pattern like something facebook would do
05:40:39 <strcat[m]> imagine facebook did this: lets say they had some registration lock PIN for an app, and they changed it into a PIN that enables remote sync/backup of certain data, without really explaining that
05:40:44 <strcat[m]> and then FORCED everyone to set this
05:41:25 <strcat[m]> and ENCOURAGED just setting a weak numeric PIN in the UI (with a subtle option to set an alphanumeric one, but lacking a proper explanation of what it does and why you should set a strong passphase)
05:41:38 <cn3m[m]> Every messenger has some major flaw
05:41:42 <strcat[m]> because that is what Signal did, not Facebook/WhatsApp
05:41:58 <strcat[m]> and now they are adding a way to avoid using this PIN after already forcing everyone to do it
05:42:05 <strcat[m]> so sure, that's better than nothing
05:42:18 <strcat[m]> but it's still encouraging everyone to do it, encouraging using a weak PIN (fully relying on SGX to make it 'secure')
05:42:32 <strcat[m]> cn3m: this is a new flaw for Signal though
05:42:58 <strcat[m]> what's happening to this room
05:44:06 <strcat[m]> anyway now that matrix has stopped having a fit
05:44:44 <alicebobandeve[m> Oh damn, I thought the whole Signal team joined the room lmao
05:45:48 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "cn3m: this is a new flaw for Sig"> That is true. I am not sure there is a better option
05:46:08 <alicebobandeve[m> strcat read through your tweets, it seems like we don't have a better option though
05:46:25 <cn3m[m]> I really only use iMessage and Signal. If there is a better one I am open to it
05:47:14 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200710-111659_RiotX.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/MVDqdEkkHGFUflGCoxnEyNnl >
05:47:15 <strcat[m]> it's possible to set a strong passphrase for this feature
05:47:20 <strcat[m]> the issue is how they've handled it
05:47:28 <strcat[m]> and how they've responded to the criticism
05:47:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wtf old messages gone
05:47:44 <alicebobandeve[m> Also, the SAF discussion was done internally by the Signal team as far as I remember, read somewhere
05:48:59 <alicebobandeve[m> But yes, I agree, their responses have been hardly suboptimal
05:49:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Matrix still doesn't do 2fa
05:49:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not from what I see
05:49:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or does it strcat
05:56:05 <pleasehelp12[m]> ao I have all the settings for touch vibration and stuff of but the keyboard still vibrates, is this something with the keyboard on graphene or is it the same as normal  android an i'm dumb
05:56:52 <concat[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Matrix still doesn't do 2fa "> Mozilla's homeserver has 2fa iirc
05:56:56 <concat[m]> But Matrix itself no, it's a custom implementation
05:57:00 <concat[m]> You get what i mean
06:00:25 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/"> Wow was it doable like this? Based on how Moxie replied i thought they way they did it was the only way it could have been achieved
06:05:23 <renlord> is there a min sdk requirement on the storage
06:05:42 <renlord> maybe signal is trying to accommodate a broad range of android version
06:05:46 <renlord> *sdk versions
06:06:08 <renlord> *encrypted storage api
06:06:52 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: yes and signal already has an encrypted backup/restore feature
06:07:09 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: and that is required to migrate to a new phone without having all your safety numbers change + losing message archives you want
06:07:19 <strcat[m]> so, they could just rely on the same thing for contacts
06:08:54 <mxnorvak[m]> I never saw anyone bring this up in Twitter
06:09:06 <mxnorvak[m]> Everyone was just pissed that the PIN is now forced
06:09:12 <renlord> productive people probably dont have time to tweet that much
06:09:57 <mxnorvak[m]> I wish there was more talk about this cause he keeps telling ppl do you have a better way of doing this as a way to stop the conversation
06:11:26 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "so, they could just rely on the "> And this makes soooo much more sense
06:11:33 <renlord> also a thankless job to correct people on twitter and get dragged into a flame war.
06:12:22 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "also a thankless job to correct "> I couldn't ever do that
06:36:12 <pleasehelp12[m]> How do I delete a file?
06:36:20 <pleasehelp12[m]> On graphene
06:38:05 <mxnorvak[m]> Moxie kept replying that you can set  BIP39 passphrase and forget it, i don't know what kind of a passphrase that is or how i can generate it,i did search about it but i still couldn't understand it, would something like EFF's word list and dice be as strong as what he is talking about for choosing a passphrase? I mean I'm gonna store it in a password manager so it don't matter if its alphanumerical or a passphrase
06:38:05 <mxnorvak[m]> but still I'd like to know
06:45:54 <f8sai[m]> <pleasehelp12[m] "How do I delete a file?"> The usual way?
07:06:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution BTW for android-prepare-vendor check the system ext partition
07:06:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> We might need to add stuff from that
07:07:27 <renor> What do you think about https://getsession.org? It is a fork of Signal which uses a Tor-like routing to route the messages...
07:07:27 <nopetapus[m]> <strcat[m] "so, they could just rely on the "> My impression of Moxie's argument was that you need some way to get your contacts back if your phone is lost, rather than as part of the normal device switching process.
07:08:01 <renor> What do you think about https://getsession.org? It is a fork of Signal which uses a Tor-like routing to route the messages... And it doesn't need phone number
07:08:24 <cn3m[m]> renor: they are super misleading
07:08:45 <renor> cn3m[m]: Why? I don't know much about them
07:09:17 <cn3m[m]> one sec
07:28:58 <strcat[m]> nopetapus: there is already encrypted backup/restore with a strong key though - and that's needed to avoid your safety number changing for each contact
07:29:34 <strcat[m]> nopetapus: maybe what they should do is make that more usable and provide first class hosting for the encrypted backups instead of needing to set up sync yourself
07:30:00 <strcat[m]> use a seed phrase instead of a bunch of numbers (BIP39 is a nice standard) and can also optionally support the BIP39 optional passphrase feature
07:30:40 <strcat[m]> nopetapus: also this wouldn't be such a big problem if they hadn't approached it by REPLACING the registration lock PIN with this (which was a useful feature and didn't do backup/sync)
07:30:55 <strcat[m]> nopetapus: because now you *have* to use this (even once they add the toggle) to have a registration lock
07:31:14 <strcat[m]> nopetapus: and if they hadn't encourage people to use a weak PIN + use broken security SGX to justify that
07:32:51 <strcat[m]> also then they go make a bunch of false / misleading claims and ban people who politely raise concerns about it and question some of the claims used to justify it
07:33:37 <strcat[m]> and then make a response to it that doesn't address the concerns, belittles the people raising concerns about it and has this holier-than-thou attitude where they pretend the people with a problem with it just don't understand and aren't considering the same things
07:36:28 <strcat[m]> nopetapus: I used registration lock before - one day I get an update where that's just gone / disabled and replaced with a new feature which I have to set up, which does more, and isn't properly explained in the app
07:36:33 <strcat[m]> it syncs data - which I don't want synced
07:37:05 <strcat[m]> so I set it up with a strong passphrase (which requires noticing there's a barely visible option to do that and that the feature doesn't just do what it does before so you DO want a strong passphrase)
07:37:26 <strcat[m]> but I don't want that data synced and I do want a registration lock enabled
07:37:44 <strcat[m]> so even after they add back the ability to not be forced to use it, doesn't solve that
07:37:56 <strcat[m]> and doesn't change that they recommend using a weak PIN by default and they don't explain properly what it does
07:38:30 <strcat[m]> and they basically use SGX to paper over another thing where they basically just punted on a real solution
07:38:49 <strcat[m]> same as contact discovery - they used to have a way to doing more private contact discovery and they abandoned it because it "didn't scale"
07:38:56 <strcat[m]> so they used SGX for that first
07:39:09 <JTL> > 00:38 <strcat[m]> same as contact discovery - they used to have a way to doing more private contact discovery and they abandoned it because it "didn't scale"
07:39:11 <strcat[m]> now they're using SGX so that they can encourage people to use weak PINs
07:39:14 <JTL> What's the story there?
07:39:52 <strcat[m]> private contact discovery is a hard problem
07:40:00 <strcat[m]> they had a solution to the problem for redphone iirc
07:40:10 <strcat[m]> and then when redphone got merged with textsecure
07:40:13 <strcat[m]> they dropped that
07:40:19 <JTL> I remember redphone, but was the solution they proposed?
07:40:20 <strcat[m]> because they decided it wouldn't scale to the higher # of users
07:40:28 <strcat[m]> JTL: they didn't initial have an alternative
07:40:36 <strcat[m]> and then later on they said they are using SGX to do it now
07:40:55 <strcat[m]> JTL: but originally they had an implementation not realizing on secure element + root of trust based attestation
07:40:56 <JTL> right
07:41:07 <JTL> Thanks for jogging my memory there
07:41:36 <strcat[m]> https://signal.org/blog/contact-discovery/
07:41:47 <strcat[m]> > For RedPhone, our user base is still manageable enough (for now) to use the bloom filter technique. For TextSecure, however, we’ve grown beyond the size where that remains practical, so the only thing we can do is write the server such that it doesn’t store the transmitted contact information, inform the user, and give them the choice of opting out.
07:42:39 <strcat[m]> JTL: can you opt out of signal contact discovery?
07:42:49 <strcat[m]> lemme see
07:43:05 <JTL> From what I remember: other then denying contact permisisons, not with an unmodified client
07:43:23 <strcat[m]> yeah I don't think you can opt out
07:43:38 <strcat[m]> interesting that they mention allowing opt out there
07:43:40 <strcat[m]> but you can't
07:43:55 <JTL> :|
07:44:19 <strcat[m]> also what else will they extend this backup / sync PIN to now?
07:44:32 <strcat[m]> and what else are they going to change like this
07:44:41 <strcat[m]> and I can't trust what they say to justify stuff
07:44:43 <strcat[m]> that's the problem
07:45:57 <JTL> Some people criticized past design decisions of Signal (use of phone numbers as identifiers, the conundrum of requiring GCM in the past, etc.) but this is a new low
07:46:22 <anne232> so
07:46:25 <anne232> signal is canceled now?
07:46:47 <anne232> okay so
07:47:02 <anne232> I know this absolutely isnt the right channel to talk about this, but since it's being discussed, I'll ask.
07:47:19 <strcat[m]> JTL: if it was on the path to just getting better
07:47:21 <strcat[m]> that's one thing
07:47:24 <polycultic[m]> i keep seeing ppl talk about this Signal update but i havent seen any actual updates
07:47:29 <polycultic[m]> :thin
07:47:41 <polycultic[m]>  * 🤔
07:48:01 <anne232> lets say i knew some ppl involved in crimes, something like jabber with encryption isnt really an option for them, they need to communicate mobile with very secure messaging.
07:48:06 <anne232> What could be the good alternative to Signal?
07:48:11 <strcat[m]> JTL: also they've consistently said they want to support non-phone-number identifiers
07:48:37 <anne232> they need somethign simple and easy and that anyone can easily set up
07:48:42 <anne232> Is there a meaningful alternative to Siganl?
07:48:42 <strcat[m]> but now they're tying that to changes like this
07:48:46 <JTL> I think people are more upset with the lack of transparency and slow progress, but better late then never.
07:49:04 <JTL> (re, "consistently said they want to support non-phone-number identifiers")
07:49:06 <strcat[m]> it bothers me that they're using usernames to justify this
07:49:12 <JTL> Me too
07:49:12 <strcat[m]> when it's not really connected
07:49:16 <polycultic[m]> there really isnt anything like signal tbh, nothing as simple easy and rock solid
07:49:22 <strcat[m]> you can ALREADY use it without giving it access to your contacts
07:49:30 <strcat[m]> and you can just message someone with signal directly in the app
07:49:32 <strcat[m]> type their number
07:49:45 <strcat[m]> you don't actually need to add them as a contact on the phone profile's contacts
07:49:48 <anne232> The phone numbers as identifiers thing is not a bad idea in my opinion. Sure it can compromise anonymity, but signal is for privacy, not anonymity.
07:49:56 <strcat[m]> and that is not backed up - that's already the case
07:50:06 <anne232> if im speaking to someone on signal, thats under the assumption that I already know who they are and trust them to some degree in most cases.
07:50:23 <strcat[m]> and it's already the case that it doesn't back up contacts / profile separately from the full encrypted backups which ofc cover it
07:50:42 <f8sai[m]> <anne232 "The phone numbers as identifiers"> It is a bad idea for some countries who can't buy SIM anonymously
07:50:46 <strcat[m]> adding usernames would fit into how it already works - if you lose your phone, you lose all your signal messages, your existing safety numbers, your contacts that are only in signal
07:50:56 <strcat[m]> and if you didn't back up your phone profile's contacts you lose those anyway
07:51:25 <strcat[m]> I don't see how supporting usernames is a justification for mandatory contact backup / sync with encouraging a weak PIN for encryption
07:51:29 <anne232> textnow or something? f8sai[m]
07:52:05 <anne232> and in what countries cant you buy burners? either way, as i said, that doesnt really matter, If I care about hiding who I am from who im talking to, I'll message them over jabber or something.
07:52:10 <f8sai[m]> Well, depends on your situation. TextNow isn't easy to setup on my experience, not sure about others.
07:52:22 <anne232> yeah they require emails and phone numbers, block your vpn and shit etc
07:52:25 <anne232> but you could use somethnig like it.
07:52:33 <strcat[m]> anne232: using an app for planning out crimes where phone number is the identifier and you make a social graph of your contacts available to the server as phone numbers? maybe not such a great idea
07:52:45 <strcat[m]> especially since people can be tracked via phone number while connected to the cellular network
07:52:47 <anne232> strcat[m], it's not like theres a long term record of your messages kept
07:53:01 <anne232> and im not talking like planning out terrorist attacks LMFAO
07:53:06 <anne232> im talking like selling cannabis
07:53:15 <JTL> Garden weeds :D
07:53:47 <anne232> sicne when are your contacts available to the Signal server?
07:54:13 <strcat[m]> anne232: they've always been temporarily made available to it
07:54:14 <f8sai[m]> But they upload contacts, profiles on server now, so probably not (lol)
07:54:14 <f8sai[m]> On average people, it's still fine, they added an insecurity feature though
07:54:22 <strcat[m]> and also it makes all your contacts on your phone available to the signal server
07:54:26 <strcat[m]> not just the ones you use with signal
07:54:28 <anne232> and if they are, how could they be compromised potentially? is this information not stored encrypted if it's even "stored" at all?
07:54:30 <strcat[m]> if you allow it to access contacts
07:54:38 <strcat[m]> anne232: it was previously not stored just used temporarily
07:54:56 <anne232> That's no longer the case?
07:54:59 <strcat[m]> anne232: previously, signal would send off your contacts to their server for contact discovery (to see if other people use signal)
07:55:04 <anne232> and yaeh you can alwayus just not give the app perms to see ur contacgts
07:55:08 <strcat[m]> and ofc to actually talk to them
07:55:10 <strcat[m]> it needs to do that
07:55:21 <strcat[m]> anne232: it still has to give the contacts you have in signal to the server
07:55:26 <strcat[m]> that's how it works the phone numbers are the identifiers
07:55:29 <strcat[m]> the server has to have them
07:55:44 <strcat[m]> it just didn't store them until recently, only used them temporarily
07:55:49 <anne232> is it inherently suspicious for two people to speak to each other?
07:56:06 <strcat[m]> it's certainly used as evidence
07:56:10 <anne232> why would they begin storing them and i sthere evidence? is it in a non encrypted form?
07:56:25 <strcat[m]> that is what this whole discussion is about
07:56:32 <anne232> its evidence of nothing. for all they know, I said hi to someone one time.
07:56:40 <strcat[m]> they introduced mandatory remote backup/sync of contacts, profiles, etc.
07:56:40 <anne232> and never spoke to them on signal again
07:56:55 <strcat[m]> it's encrypted backup but it encourages you to set a weak PIN which the encryption is based on
07:56:57 <anne232> When did this happen? I haven't seen an update in a while.
07:57:01 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't offer a way to generate a strong key itself
07:57:07 <anne232> i see.
07:57:17 <strcat[m]> anne232: recently - use it from aurora store instead of the website apk if you want the latest stable release
07:57:20 <anne232> The only PIN it lets me put it on signal is my registration lock pin though?
07:57:28 <anne232> and it also uses your android passcode if you set it to
07:57:31 <strcat[m]> anne232: registration lock PIN was removed in the latest releases
07:57:42 <anne232> wtf
07:57:50 <anne232> why lmao that was a good feature imo atleast
07:57:53 <strcat[m]> anne232: that feature was removed, if you want to set a registration lock you need to set a sync PIN, it's the same PIN for backup/sync and registration lock
07:58:07 <strcat[m]> anne232: it still exists but you can't use it without enabling remote backup / sync of contacts / profiles / settings
07:58:18 <anne232> is the update on f-droid? i have that installed too
07:58:25 <strcat[m]> they replaced registration lock with sync PIN, basically, it does registration lock too
07:58:27 <strcat[m]> signal isn't on f-droid
07:58:32 <anne232> wtf? why
07:58:37 <anne232> i swear i remember it being on fdroid
07:58:43 <anne232> maybe i downloaded the apk idfk
07:58:46 <strcat[m]> they don't have their own f-droid repo
07:58:51 <strcat[m]> and it's not in the official f-droid repo either
07:59:09 <strcat[m]> it's on the play store and they have an apk published on their website that checks for updates
07:59:22 <strcat[m]> it sounds like you might have just downloaded the play store apk without having an app to update it like aurora store
07:59:28 <strcat[m]> or you aren't checking for updates in aurora store
07:59:36 <anne232> I have had it notify me of updates a few times
07:59:39 <strcat[m]> website apk they publish often lags behind
07:59:43 <anne232> I just dont remember getting one recently or noticing any changes
07:59:45 <strcat[m]> then you have the website apk
07:59:52 <strcat[m]> anne232: you don't have the latest release, that's clear
07:59:56 <strcat[m]> registration lock PIN is gone
08:00:00 <strcat[m]> that's what I was talking about above
08:00:11 <strcat[m]> I had a registration lock set - one day I get an update where it's removed / disabled
08:00:18 <anne232> well tbh
08:00:23 <strcat[m]> and I had to set a new kind of sync PIN to get that
08:00:24 <anne232> we were sparring about this earlier but i agree with you now
08:00:28 <strcat[m]> which also syncs contacts with it
08:00:34 <f8sai[m]> <strcat[m] "they introduced mandatory remote"> quite an antifeature for some
08:00:39 <strcat[m]> so instead of a simple PIN I set a strong passphrase
08:00:44 <strcat[m]> but I don't WANT sync of contacts
08:01:21 <anne232> so.... briar?
08:01:22 <strcat[m]> but since I was registration lock I have to have contacts / profile / settings sync
08:01:24 <strcat[m]> even though I don't want it
08:01:36 <JTL> Ne neither...
08:01:38 <strcat[m]> and I already use Signal's encrypted backup feature to make encrypted local backups that I back up
08:01:49 <strcat[m]> and that covers ALL THE STUFF they are backing up to their server with this new feature
08:02:02 <strcat[m]> and also my keys / messages
08:02:29 <strcat[m]> anne232: and my issue with them is not so much that they even replaced the registration lock with thios
08:02:34 <strcat[m]> I disagree with that, but it's not the main issue
08:02:38 <strcat[m]>  * anne232: and my issue with them is not so much that they even replaced the registration lock with this
08:03:04 <strcat[m]> the main issue is that they put nag messages to set this PIN which got progressively more annoying, taking up 30% of your screen with no way to dismiss
08:03:07 <strcat[m]> and then they made it fully mandatory
08:03:34 <strcat[m]> and it encourages you to set a weak PIN - you can press a barely visible option to set an alphanumeric passphrase and set a strong one
08:03:42 <strcat[m]> but they don't really explain why you should do that
08:03:45 <f8sai[m]> time to wipe signal accounts
08:03:49 <strcat[m]> and they make it seem like a weak PIN is perfectly fine
08:03:56 <strcat[m]> so my problem is with how they introduced this
08:04:00 <strcat[m]> the lack of information they provide
08:04:08 <strcat[m]> and then how they responded to the controversy about it
08:04:27 <strcat[m]> by dismissing it, hand waving it away, and not really addressing legitimate concerns
08:04:55 <strcat[m]> they are going to add back the option of not using the feature now - which is how it was originally, they went through a lot of effort to force everyone to use this (which is done now - you can't use the app without setting it up atm)
08:05:15 <strcat[m]> so they are going to take back forcing people to do it after they already forced everyone on the up-to-date app to enable it
08:05:31 <strcat[m]> but you have to use it if you still want registration lock which you definitely want
08:05:49 <strcat[m]> it's not really a problem to have this if you set a strong passphrase - but we know most people won't, even if they try it will probably be a weak passphrase
08:06:13 <f8sai[m]> (well, that is if you can get your sims or numbers anonymously)
08:06:27 <strcat[m]> so I just set a strong passphrase, and it's fine for me, but the problem is 99% of other people are going to set a weak PIN and then their contacts are stored there + protected by their weak PIN and SGX nonsense
08:07:22 <strcat[m]> anne232: the data is already available to their server temporarily for contact discovery or when you actually message people but... it should be possible to disable contact discovery
08:07:34 <strcat[m]> and it's already possible to disable contacts access for the app so it only knows about contacts you directly enter into it
08:07:35 <anne232> I always thought it was
08:07:42 <strcat[m]> anne232: not really
08:07:49 <strcat[m]> if you allow it access to your contacts it uploads them all
08:07:56 <strcat[m]> if you don't allow it, then it can't know about them
08:08:00 <strcat[m]> and you can still use it like that
08:08:17 <strcat[m]> most people won't realize they can use it without allowing it contacts access
08:08:47 <anne232> I mean you can just manually type in the phone number.
08:08:56 <strcat[m]> especially since Signal and many other apps REFUSE to allow certain features to be used if you reject permissions like Storage even though those permissions are not needed
08:09:03 <strcat[m]> particularly for Storage which is deprecated / being removed
08:09:11 <f8sai[m]> Well, wait a minute. Does it also upload the one you actually contacted on Signal, but not on contacts (like a random number), with contacts permission denied.
08:09:13 <strcat[m]> anne232: yes and ofc it still sends those to the server
08:09:32 <f8sai[m]> Oh it got answered.
08:09:36 <strcat[m]> if contacts permission is denied it doesn't have access to your phone profile's contacts
08:09:41 <strcat[m]> if you allow it, it will upload them all
08:09:47 <strcat[m]> no option to avoid uploading contacts for discovery
08:09:55 <strcat[m]> but it doesn't store what it uploads on their server
08:10:04 <strcat[m]> they don't store it - until this contacts sync feature they added
08:10:17 <strcat[m]> and replaced registration lock with generic PIN doing both registration lock + data sync
08:10:34 <strcat[m]> which they made mandatory (being undone but everyone who updated had to make one which turned on data sync)
08:25:31 <anne232> wel
08:25:38 <anne232> enough of this sigal talk, can someone actual help me install grapheneOS?
08:25:56 <anne232> sorry i didnt wanna come off rude with that ;)
08:26:02 <anne232> But here, its giving me a weird error
08:26:33 <anne232> https://hastebin.com/wyhqkwtlbn
08:29:51 <f8sai[m]> <anne232 "https://hastebin.com/wyhqkwtlbn"> There's nothing there?
08:36:53 <f8sai[m]> No offense though
08:37:13 <anne232> let me see this
08:37:55 <anne232> thats weird
08:38:02 <anne232> leme see if i can find another site to put this on
08:43:04 <anne232> https://pastebin.com/HHDNXSqX
08:43:16 <anne232> pastebin had the ip i was using banned before

08:45:59 <JTL> old release?
08:47:04 <anne232> It was copy and pasted directly off of the graphene os website lol so maybe
08:47:26 <anne232> Does that really explain why I was having problems though?

08:51:46 <f8sai[m]> Yeah
08:51:47 <f8sai[m]> You weren't suppose to copy paste thaf
08:51:49 <f8sai[m]> As in all, just the parts, and insert the model you wanted to download with latest release
08:51:50 <f8sai[m]> Example, if mine is bonito,
08:51:50 <f8sai[m]> I would do unzip bonito-factory-2020.07.06.20.zip
08:51:52 <f8sai[m]> Reading again will help, with a calm mind ofc
08:51:53 <f8sai[m]> Unless you are actually downloading an old version for whatever reason
08:53:54 <anne232> tbh that should have been obvious but i had been up for over a full day when i was doing that.
08:54:06 <anne232> and i was just trying to get it done quick and ez without any thought
08:56:36 <f8sai[m]> "Download the factory images for the device from the releases page. For example, to download the 2020.05.05.02 release for the Pixel 3 XL (crosshatch)"
08:57:49 <anne232> yea  im already embarrassed enough! lmfao
08:58:08 <anne232> i read alot of the other stuff, guess i skimmed that
08:58:21 <f8sai[m]> It's fine. We all start somewhere (and sometimes at mistakes)
08:58:24 <f8sai[m]> Good luck
08:58:35 <anne232> yeah but i normally dont do things this stupid lmfao
08:58:42 <anne232> but thanks
08:59:55 <f8sai[m]> No problem. Just ask here when something gets wrong
09:00:21 <anne232> alright thanks. ill let this download, ill probs go to bed for a few hours adn get up and finish the installation
09:02:15 <f8sai[m]> (on your installation)
09:02:15 <f8sai[m]> (Also, it is possible to install it from a completely offline Windows 10, provided you got the files beforehand.)
09:02:50 <anne232> lol
09:02:56 <anne232> i wouldnt touch windows 10 with a 2000 foot pole
09:03:56 <f8sai[m]> Sure lol
09:04:27 <f8sai[m]> Just giving you an option though. Had run into issues with linux installations outside arch/debian-based linux
09:04:42 <f8sai[m]> But probably you'll be fine at pop os
09:04:52 <anne232> popos is ubuntu so therefore deb based
09:05:14 <anne232> i would use my main PC but for some reason qubes doesnt seem to recognize any phones or tablet devices i plug in??
09:05:50 <anne232> but yeah id rather live out in the woods with uncle ted than use a microsoft os
09:07:22 <f8sai[m]> If only GrapheneOS is compatible to dual or more screens (would be hard to develop if there isn't) with wired C to HDMI/VGA, may help replace some laptop works
09:07:43 <anne232> you'd be confined to android.
09:07:48 <anne232> which would kind of suck
09:07:59 <anne232> you could always run linux in a chroot
09:08:22 <geritol[m]> Just use an iPad
09:08:40 <geritol[m]> Run an emulator or something
09:08:54 <geritol[m]> That's all you need for a laptop if you're crafty and crazy though
09:09:02 <anne232> ios is spyware lmfao
09:09:17 <geritol[m]> It's not that's bull
09:09:20 <f8sai[m]> Too expensive lol, but yeah you would need it eventually
09:09:26 <f8sai[m]> Cant flash graphene without pc
09:10:01 <cn3m[m]> <f8sai[m] "Too expensive lol, but yeah you "> iPads go on sale new for $250 fairly often
09:10:14 <geritol[m]> Yeah that
09:10:43 <f8sai[m]> <cn3m[m] "iPads go on sale new for $250 fa"> I meant laptops on general but okay
09:10:44 <anne232> i struggle to see why anyone would want an ipad
09:11:06 <anne232> despite ios being total shit, like, what use do tablets REALLY have?
09:11:16 <f8sai[m]> <cn3m[m] "iPads go on sale new for $250 fa"> Also, I will never see an iPad sold at that price here in our place
09:11:17 <anne232> What use does a tablet have that a laptop or phone cant serve?
09:11:18 <geritol[m]> <anne232 "i struggle to see why anyone wou"> They are fantastic with GrapheneOS
09:11:32 <anne232> grapheneos can only run on pixel devices.
09:11:32 <f8sai[m]> Check at the logs by cn3m about iOS
09:11:38 <geritol[m]> <anne232 "despite ios being total shit, li"> iOS is really the only other sane OS
09:11:51 <anne232> we aint rehashing this one lmfao
09:12:04 <anne232> its closed source, enough said.
09:12:32 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "its closed source, enough said."> fuck you are right. So is my Pixel
09:12:38 <cn3m[m]> oh right and I don't control root certs
09:12:50 <cn3m[m]> Well screw it can't use GrapheneOS anymore
09:13:12 <anne232> grapheneos is open source.
09:13:15 <cn3m[m]> well Replicant has no security, but at least they are FOSS? Fuck, no they have blobs in the boot chain
09:13:20 <anne232> just b/c some of the hardware might be. meh
09:13:25 <anne232> most hardware isnt open
09:13:38 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "grapheneos is open source."> It is using closed source bits though so how can it be by your logic?
09:13:53 <anne232> citation?
09:14:07 <anne232> okay.
09:14:12 <f8sai[m]> Btw, iOS' base OS Darwin is open source
09:14:12 <anne232> so even if what you are saying is true
09:14:21 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "citation?"> blobs for drivers, firmwares.
09:14:27 <anne232> that iOS is secure, etc
09:14:31 <cn3m[m]> <f8sai[m] "Btw, iOS' base OS Darwin is open"> much more of it is open source than just that
09:14:32 <cn3m[m]> but yes
09:14:35 <anne232> just because something is secure does not mean that it is good.
09:14:38 <cn3m[m]> the majority of iOS is open source
09:14:52 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "that iOS is secure, etc"> will the developer of GrapheneOS suffice as a source?
09:14:53 <anne232> It's still very limiting in how it lets you use your device.
09:15:02 <anne232> sure
09:15:12 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "It's still very limiting in how "> great, but we are talking about security and privacy
09:15:28 <cn3m[m]> which iOS excels at
09:15:51 <geritol[m]> iOS has some noteworthy advantages on security
09:16:02 <anne232> You have no way of verifying that apple, the nsa, or whoever else they have given backdoors to isnt spying on you or collecting data somehow
09:16:08 <anne232> privacy, I would dispute, in that sense.
09:16:16 <geritol[m]> <anne232 "You have no way of verifying tha"> Same with anything dude
09:16:20 <anne232> security, definitely, but again, i dont think tahts a good defense
09:16:55 <cn3m[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/?q=iphone&ch=grapheneos&n=strcat%5Bm%5Danne232: read this
09:17:04 <cn3m[m]> iOS has much better privacy and security than anything beside GrapheneOS
09:17:18 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "You have no way of verifying tha"> that applies to GrapheneOS just as much
09:17:26 <cn3m[m]> that applies to anything
09:17:31 <f8sai[m]> Well, cite the last iOS exploit that compromised iOS data?
09:17:44 <f8sai[m]> same goes for Android?
09:18:14 <cn3m[m]> <f8sai[m] "Well, cite the last iOS exploit "> and you can't use the example of the people who installed malware to jailbreak
09:18:38 <anne232> the ios exploit that the fbi used a couple years ago?
09:18:43 <anne232> Thats enough to instill fear.
09:18:59 <anne232> atleast apple didn't comply with the warrant though, but it was out of economic interests,
09:19:04 <Mobius[m]> 🍿
09:19:34 <anne232> and tbh i dont keep up with security news but I've heard that theres alot of android vulnerabilities
09:19:54 <SchismXL[m]> I think it comes down to whether you have trust in Apple or not. You pretty much have to have an account to use the features. Some people aren't comfortable doing that. And, as previously stated, you don't know what's going on behind the scenes and you cannot guarantee Apple isn't just letting the authorities syphon off data and have access to anything and everything.
09:19:54 <SchismXL[m]> However, could I be persuaded to use an iOS device? Yes, but with no internet connection whatsoever. I think, the same with many people here, would disagree that an iOS device could give you more security because of reports that the authorities haven't been able to access and that Apple seemingly says no to handing over encryption keys etc.
09:20:11 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "the ios exploit that the fbi use"> you mean trident? did you know that was the last attack that has ever gained persistence on iOS since then? 4 years. It was caught since it was a random link in a text
09:20:28 <cn3m[m]> very expensive attack
09:20:36 <cn3m[m]> I trust Apple to build a device more than anyone else
09:20:42 <cn3m[m]> never got that argument
09:20:48 <f8sai[m]> <Mobius[m] "🍿"> Give me some as well
09:20:51 <anne232> I don't doubt that it's been patched.
09:21:28 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "I don't doubt that it's been pat"> it was patched and a persistent attack has never been seen since
09:21:32 <cn3m[m]> 4 years ago
09:21:33 <cn3m[m]> that is very impressive
09:21:42 <f8sai[m]> How about on the other side. Malware installed by user don't count too, just a persistent attack as well
09:21:52 <anne232> not really i mean
09:21:54 <SchismXL[m]> So, once again, it comes down to risk factor and use case. Happy to have a company seemingly keep you private and have devices that are difficult to penetrate? Go iOS. Want something you want to tinker with and are a techy? GrapheneOS.
09:21:56 <anne232> ive never heard of cryptsetup being broken?
09:22:05 <cn3m[m]> <f8sai[m] "How about on the other side. Mal"> malware is far rarer on iOS though
09:22:10 <f8sai[m]> Truly
09:22:28 <anne232> I've never heard of iOS malware in a normal ios phone
09:22:34 <anne232> but again, i do not keep up with this stuff
09:22:36 <cn3m[m]> <SchismXL[m] "So, once again, it comes down to"> GrapheneOS is cool as hell and very secure and private. iOS is also very secure and private
09:22:38 <cn3m[m]> there isn't a competition between them
09:22:39 <f8sai[m]> Accessibility services, device admins, modify system settings are some of the dangerous permissions
09:22:41 <cn3m[m]> both are great
09:22:45 <cn3m[m]> and both are unmatched in protecting you
09:22:53 <JTL> > 02:21 <f8sai[m]> How about on the other side. Malware installed by user don't count too, just a persistent attack as well
09:22:55 <JTL> Million dollar question, does said malware app get persistent root access? Nah
09:23:07 <anne232> I just feel like  graphene gives you more freedom wrt to your device, open source
09:23:13 <anne232> and ultimately, graphene aligns more with what i stand for.
09:23:29 <cn3m[m]> iOS is very secure and it is a good alternative to GrapheneOS
09:23:33 <cn3m[m]> they compliment each other
09:23:41 <anne232> Apple is a company that stands for the rich, priviliged elite.
09:23:52 <cn3m[m]> both focus on meaningful improvements without the privacy and security theater
09:24:17 <cn3m[m]> they give credibility to each other
09:24:27 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "Apple is a company that stands f"> They make their money off hardware not your data. How else do you expect them to compete
09:24:28 <alex-resist> Folks, what you are discussing here largely depends on your threat model, your personal preferences and politics. There will be no objective winner in this one.
09:24:42 <cn3m[m]> surprise privacy and security is for the rich
09:24:43 <SchismXL[m]> cn3m I would say GrapheneOS more so, because you don't need an account to fully utilise the phone, and it isn't calling back to servers constantly. As I said, its all about personal preference and whether someone is okay with handing data over to the company or not. I, myself, am not happy with that, hence leaning toward GrapheneOS
09:24:54 <SchismXL[m]> <alex-resist "Folks, what you are discussing h"> What I'm trying to say!
09:25:10 <cn3m[m]> at least they support their devices for 6-7 years so if you buy one you can keep it for a reasonable amount of time
09:25:15 <cn3m[m]> <SchismXL[m] "cn3m I would say GrapheneOS more"> iOS isn't data mining
09:25:31 <SchismXL[m]> Closed source. You don't know that 100%.
09:25:37 <anne232> i'd argue that much of their high pricing has to do with branding.
09:25:40 <cn3m[m]> iOS and GrapheneOS help each other by pushing forward good ideas everyone else seems to miss
09:25:41 <cn3m[m]> or not care about
09:25:47 <anne232> its edgy, trendy and cool to have a macbook or an iphone
09:26:09 <anne232> aye, SchismXL[m]
09:26:12 <cn3m[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Closed source. You don't know th"> Oh right okay thanks. I use closed source code on my Pixel below the OS layer
09:26:15 <anne232> thats what i maent by it being a resitrcting OS
09:26:17 <cn3m[m]> gotta through that out
09:26:37 <anne232> I mean, can you even use pirated music on it?
09:26:44 <anne232> Don't they require you to do all your music through iTunes?
09:26:49 <anne232> well idk itunes may be gone now
09:26:50 <anne232> but still
09:26:57 <cn3m[m]> yes you can use pirated music on an iPhone
09:27:03 <cn3m[m]> you can even pirate on it
09:27:05 <cn3m[m]> you can run linux on it
09:27:19 <cn3m[m]> you can sideload apps
09:27:20 <cn3m[m]> you can use it without an account
09:27:23 <cn3m[m]> you have a full file system
09:27:52 <anne232> im not sure that you can entirely functionally use an iphone without an apple iD???
09:28:05 <cn3m[m]> iOS vs GrapheneOS is so pointless
09:28:05 <anne232> i used an iphone, I think 5 or something, many many years ago
09:28:08 <anne232> for like 3 months bc i was broke af
09:28:13 <anne232> and it was a spare phone i had
09:28:14 <cn3m[m]> pick what you prefer and both are fantastic
09:28:19 <anne232> and I remember needing an apple id for everything
09:28:28 <anne232> I dont remember being able to "sideload" apps
09:28:28 <cn3m[m]> <anne232 "im not sure that you can entirel"> you definitely can
09:28:37 <cn3m[m]> iPhone 5 not so much
09:28:46 <cn3m[m]> this is all new
09:28:49 <anne232> well, it wasnt that old back then
09:28:50 <SchismXL[m]> <anne232 "I dont remember being able to "s"> Yeah, you can now without root etc.
09:28:51 <cn3m[m]> including the file system
09:29:00 <cn3m[m]> Jonathan Zdziarski was hired in 2017
09:29:06 <anne232> so, it's changed a lot in recent years?
09:29:08 <cn3m[m]> he is a privacy and security genius
09:29:12 <anne232> Because, Ill be honest, I havent used it in a long time.
09:29:16 <anne232> because I hated it.
09:29:18 <anne232> when i did use it
09:29:29 <cn3m[m]> yes a absolute ton
09:29:31 <diagocosta[m]> You can use iphone without apple ID??
09:29:42 <cn3m[m]> Tim Cook is also vastly better than Jobs
09:29:45 <cn3m[m]> the leadership is much much better
09:30:17 <diagocosta[m]> I have iPhone 8 in 2018 and you had to use apple ID for everything
09:32:12 <cn3m[m]> yes, but it isn't a perfect experience
09:32:17 <cn3m[m]> you need to use an open source app store or something
09:32:22 <anne232> fck yall
09:32:23 <cn3m[m]> I have
09:32:26 <cn3m[m]> Alt Store for example
09:32:28 <cn3m[m]> I just use a randomly generated Apple ID they don't verify anything
09:32:30 <cn3m[m]> the only thing you need an Apple ID for is the store
09:32:30 <anne232> im trying to lock my bootloader rn
09:32:34 <cn3m[m]> Apple ID is fine privacy wise. It isn't perfect
09:32:41 <anne232> and i acnnot open he bootloader to do it
09:32:44 <cn3m[m]> I tend to say iOS and GrapheneOS tie on security. GrapheneOS wins narrowly on first party privacy and iOS wins narrowly on third party privacy
09:32:48 <cn3m[m]> just pick what you prefer
09:32:52 <cn3m[m]> Generally I recommend GrapheneOS, but iOS is so much more secure and private than anything else say in the desktop space
09:32:56 <cn3m[m]> the ideal setup is the latest iPhone and iPad(as your laptop_
09:33:05 <cn3m[m]> anne232: lock or unlock?
09:33:15 <anne232> im trynig to lock it.
09:33:23 <anne232> i just installed grapheneos a few mins ago
09:33:46 <f8sai[m]> Not sure how ad hominem makes the fact waker, but bootloader lock is
09:33:46 <f8sai[m]> fastboot flashing lock
09:33:57 <anne232> i know but
09:34:03 <anne232> dont you have to have the bootloader open
09:34:05 <anne232> to run that command?
09:34:30 <cn3m[m]> the iPhone and iPadTop is a pretty hardcore privacy/security build though so it is generally hard to pull off. I use GrapheneOS and Windows 10 which is better for me. iPhone and iPad is a close second(probably would do that if Microsoft goes downhill again)
09:34:38 <cn3m[m]> anne232: you in fastboot?
09:34:49 <f8sai[m]> <anne232 "dont you have to have the bootlo"> Yeah
09:34:52 <f8sai[m]> Then you close it?
09:35:07 <anne232> im not using fastboot rn,
09:35:10 <anne232> yueah i made the dumbass mistake
09:35:12 <anne232> of booting grapheneos
09:35:16 <anne232> before locking the bootlaoder
09:36:15 <anne232> ok finally
09:36:20 <anne232> i managed to get the bootloader open again jfc
09:36:31 <anne232> it was so hard, like it would open for what felt like a split second and then boot
09:36:31 <spaceinfinite[m]> <strcat[m] "they don't store it - until this"> Moxi blocking you is a real sign of worry!Signal is going the wrong way as it wants to go mainstream and gather as many users as it possibly can and then just become whatsapp or like any other app but having the face to hide behind the privacy image they have built. Its not just you commenting on this TheGrugq, MathewGreen etc etc people with knowledge had a go at
09:36:31 <spaceinfinite[m]> signal.
09:37:18 <anne232> what do y'all think of briar as an alternative to signal?
09:38:03 <anne232> Woo! installed grapheneos
09:38:06 <anne232> be on later yall, goign the fuck to sleep
09:38:16 <alex-resist> Briar is a different category. Not many people will use it, whatever its merits are
09:38:41 <cn3m[m]> Briar is too limited on platforms
09:39:19 <cn3m[m]> Android only is a deal breaker for me. Very few people I know use an Android device with any regularity
09:39:33 <alex-resist> Generally it would be helpful if people could make up their minds on what they actually want and need, and who they want to defend against. So many discussions are just superfluous.
09:40:57 <spaceinfinite[m]> <cn3m[m] "Briar is too limited on platform"> There is nothing other than Threema at the moment opensource or not
09:43:02 <cn3m[m]> I will keep using Signal
09:45:23 <cn3m[m]> I finally moved everyone over to Signal or at least iMessage. I can't move again
09:45:35 <alex-resist> Signal's main downside is not them storing small amounts of data on their servers, but the broadcasting of every member's phone number in group chats. That is absolutely unacceptable for certain contexts. Yes, they are planning to move away from phone numbers, but at a glacial pace
09:46:38 <alzxjm[m]> <cn3m[m] "I will keep using Signal"> I convinced my whole family and lots of my friends to use Signal. It would be unacceptable to get them to move off it at this point. Most people don't care if the devs are dishonest about security minutae. They care about reliability, features, and not having to do stuff.
09:47:18 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "I convinced my whole family and "> I disagree with the recent moves, but I think they are still one of the best
09:47:26 <cn3m[m]> they aren't "perfect" anymore
09:47:48 <f8sai[m]> They never were though
09:48:10 <cn3m[m]> they have always been vastly better than the competition for my needs
09:48:19 <joeri_poeri[m]> what other service would you guys recommend. you could use Briar but there isn't a whole lot like it
09:49:09 <SchismXL[m]> Pixel 4 XL just arrived. Oh yes.
09:49:49 <alzxjm[m]> Signal going for the masses is a good thing. Bringing secure, private messaging to the everyday user is crucial, rather than just telling people to buy an iPhone or use Google's insecure RCS implementation.
09:50:33 <alzxjm[m]> It's a shame Daniel has misgivings about their communication and transparency. Is there anything we can do as users to agitate for change that would make their app compatible with Graphene's standards?
09:50:38 <cn3m[m]> RCS was such a letdown
09:50:57 <polycultic[m]> <alzxjm[m] "It's a shame Daniel has misgivin"> they have a forum
09:52:29 <cn3m[m]> yeah couldn't hurt
09:54:37 <cn3m[m]> ultimately nothing is perfect and it sucks
09:54:55 <polycultic[m]> matrix will be someday
09:55:20 <polycultic[m]> but for now im stretched across Telegram, Signal, Discord, etc
09:57:32 <cn3m[m]> I doubt it
09:57:33 <alzxjm[m]> So as I understand it, the sin here is that Signal is sort of retrofitting the registration PIN into a contacts sync on their servers, using that same PIN but not encouraging users to use a stronger passphrase?
09:57:34 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "So as I understand it, the sin h"> not actively encouraging it no
09:57:35 <cn3m[m]> nitter.net/DanielMicay
10:02:23 <f8sai[m]> <alzxjm[m] "So as I understand it, the sin h"> Could be a good tip, but using multiple profiles with multiple signal may help
10:02:33 <f8sai[m]> Some no pins, some with pins?
10:02:38 <f8sai[m]> Kinda scattered and inconvenient tho

10:33:08 <pikey[m]> > <@schismxl:matrix.org> Serious question... Why would you go iOS instead of Android? More specifically, deGoogled Android. It does baffle me how someone can go to iOS. I'm not an Apple shill, by any means, but there's no way I could ever trust any iDevice to have any sort of data on it. Yes, there have been "cases" in the past where the authorities have been told "no" from Apple for unlocking or having a back door into
10:33:08 <pikey[m]> devices, but that's all you typically see in the press and not what may be going on behind closed doors.

10:40:07 <crueltekk[m]> Okay wtf sorry -_- riotx glitched me into editmode.
10:42:37 <crueltekk[m]> Hmm okay sync slightly overused system resources. He's progressing now and seems okay. But at peak he used 32.4 GB of RAM
10:49:16 <strcat[m]> I think you're measuring memory usage incorrectly
10:51:07 <crueltekk[m]> Don't think so.
10:51:07 <crueltekk[m]> It was using ~32 out of 64 GB. Nothing else is running except riot.
10:51:25 <pikey[m]> <SchismXL[m] "We're on the same journey, for s"> hahaha. sorry. I did a rather major typo there, not concentrating. What I meant to say is, at least to some degree for sure, it ISSSS what is going on behind closed doors!
10:52:04 <strcat[m]> crueltekk: as I said I think you're measuring memory usage incorrectly
10:52:16 <strcat[m]> syncing the kernel repositories doesn't take that much memory
10:52:19 <strcat[m]> how are you measuring memory usage?
10:53:33 <crueltekk[m]> System monitor and htop
10:54:17 <strcat[m]> I think you're looking at memory usage including cache
10:54:53 <strcat[m]> there's no way cloning the kernel repositories takes that much memory
10:55:28 <strcat[m]> run free -m in a terminal and show the output
10:55:59 <strcat[m]> just doesn't make sense
10:59:08 <crueltekk[m]> He's done now. Cache is still around 16gb. Will get the dev tree in a sec and have a look if I run into the same problem.
11:01:33 <strcat[m]> you shouldn't be looking at cache as if it's actually used memory
11:01:47 <strcat[m]> the OS fills your entire available memory with cached pages
11:01:49 <strcat[m]> it's not "used" memory
11:03:21 <crueltekk[m]> I know that the cache is not the actual ram usage.
11:03:52 <crueltekk[m]> Okay then my system and cache are weird?
11:04:10 <crueltekk[m]> Never got 64gb in cache
11:31:32 <pikey[m]> I was talking to someone today about all sorts of things and one of them was the covid tracking stuff. I know little more than nothing about it. But I wondered if Graphene mitigates for things like that? I assume it can't as I would assume the tel companies are tracking movements based on cell towers, but if anyone knows I would be interested to hear if Graphene does help with this sort of thing.
11:35:29 <odisaben[m]> pikey: I second this question. Part of the push that made me jump off Android.
11:36:50 <SchismXL[m]> Okay, bit of an odd one... I've just installed and set up on my Pixel 4 XL, which went flawlessly. However, when changing the WiFi settings (to static and personal DNS) the device restarted. I can force reset the device, but after I enter my passphrase, it reboots instantly.
11:39:10 <pikey[m]> <odisaben[m] "pikey: I second this question. P"> cool, hopefully someone has some knowledge. I know I haven't!! It was the final push for me to speed up and finish my move from iphone. I noticed a forced update, which apparently "Apple doesn't do". I changed sim to test a burner sim I had, and my phone just 'decided' to accept an iOS update I had been rejecting for a while. That made me want to break shit, so I took the
11:39:10 <pikey[m]> plunge and dumped it! It's now a burner being tracked while it sits in my desk drawer just for verification codes online etc.  :D

11:39:32 <f8sai[m]> Plus you had to install the tracking app anywaysm
11:39:43 <f8sai[m]> Furthermore, you can turn off radio modems in airplane mode.
11:39:55 <SchismXL[m]> Now it just reboots hard reboot (once it gets to the home screen before entering password)
11:40:33 <pikey[m]> <f8sai[m] "It's integrate into Google Play "> The question of what "it" is was perhaps a better way for me to phrase the question. So "it" is an app? cool. Although on iOS (i have never had android, til Graphene) I heard it's built into the OS

11:42:09 <pikey[m]> Can I ask what you use for DNS, if not VPN ones?

11:43:38 <pikey[m]> do you avoid VPN DNS? Is that good practice?
11:44:24 <SchismXL[m]> Currently not connecting to a VPN. I was just testing to see if the phone would work with my Pihole, but after I've changed those settings, its just boot looping now.

Especially not when it comes with the fastest processor in a phone, 5-7 years of guaranteed updates and iOS's excellent track record for security. You could certainly do a lot worse for that money
15:06:06 <jcpicard32[m]> I certainly have issues with spending $1000 for the higher end phones but that's because I think phones are essentially disposable and I say the same about expensive Android phones

15:10:01 <SchismXL[m]> Its only in the last couple of weeks(?) that the Pixel 4 devices have been made stable.

What I would, and do call unreasonable, is them charging that for the phone AND pushing marketing at me. I know I am weird. Most people don't object to it. But I do and I have a choice now, thanks to Graphene/Pixel, so that's my choice. After many years as an Apple devotee (and I do and will continue to use apple desktop hardware) I wont
15:14:25 <pikey[m]> use any of their phones or tablets again. Apple hardware is good. Never said it isnt. I just take offence at the premium product line (and it is premium) with premium price tag, then turning me into a product. Get fucked, is my answer to that idea. :)

Roll on the Pixel 5, then 3a might be $100-150 and then i will have a handful :D
15:17:07 <jcpicard32[m]> pikey: That's fair. I still use an iPhone and iPad every day in addition to my GrapheneOS Phone. I like both operating systems. I ran an MITM on my old iPhone after opting out of iCloud/Siri/selecting "Limit ad tracking" and didn't notice anything suspicious. Not wanting privacy invasive stuff out of the box is certainly fair. But I respect and trust them when they say they do as much processing on device as
15:17:07 <jcpicard32[m]> possible.
15:17:23 <sppin[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m]1 "No. They are the same."> Im talking about the hardware, would'nt google and qualcomm's flapship/more expensive products have better security?
15:18:12 <M0xC0ncord[m]1> <sppin[m] "Im talking about the hardware, w"> I'm not sure what you are asking. The only difference in hardware between the 4 and 4a is the chipset. Both are Qualcomm chips.
15:18:43 <sppin[m]> Yeah but the 4a has a mid range chip
15:18:47 <rover1[m]> security probably not change much, processor speed and cores maybe
15:19:07 <sppin[m]> I'm concered how that may affect the security
15:19:28 <rover1[m]> unless there some other security chip not put in cheaper model
15:20:19 <pikey[m]> <jcpicard32[m] "pikey: That's fair. I still use "> Fair enough and I don't disagree with much of that. Apple has one of the best marketing approaches the world has ever seen, they practially invented the idea of using packaging to sell a product, thjey are marketing genuises. Likewise, some of these phrases are exquisitely clever, such as "do as much processing on device as possible". It's a bit like a distraction from
15:20:19 <pikey[m]> the issue anyone reading that would want to know. I murder as few people as possible. ;)
15:20:27 <M0xC0ncord[m]1> <sppin[m] "I'm concered how that may affect"> There is no difference in security. It's simply a lower-power chip. The 4a exists so that users can get access to the Pixel's camera and software at a cheaper price point.
15:21:09 <sppin[m]> I'm really sorry, are you qualified enough to be able to state that?
15:21:13 <rover1[m]> <M0xC0ncord[m]1 "There is no difference in securi"> convert more to google empire

ONly take the trust/risks you HAVE to. So I would agree, life can happen without Apple, and this is
15:35:51 <pikey[m]> the place to find the only secure alternative imo
15:36:16 <alicebobandeve[m> Anyway, discussing iOS is off-topic. You can get your suggestions on that topic in another room.

I, for what it's worth, am the latter.

19:49:55 <crueltekk[m]> <interceptingfist "If phone does read a sim card is"> If the phone reads the SIM there should be no replacement costs ;)
19:50:15 <crueltekk[m]> L
20:05:09 <suh[m]> ello
20:05:24 <suh[m]> can graphene be insatlled on samsuns s10
20:16:53 <nscnt> suh[m]: No. Take a look at https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices and https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
20:19:47 <outsider[m]1> does anyone disable default certificates on graphene?
20:26:48 <hiya> What is the best solution for SMS Backup & Restore from Android phone with Gapps to GrapheneOS vanilla?
20:27:36 <nscnt> Drop SMS :]
20:27:49 <cdesai> there's an app named just that which should work, but it's on the play store, so somebody else might have a better recommnedation
20:28:01 <cdesai> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore
20:43:18 <hiya> cdesai: hmm, it seems like the right tool but won't it be better to use something open?
20:56:46 <hiya> I think it is a good tool, it works offline or in Airplane mode too.
21:05:14 <SchismXL[m]> Never realised how slow Firefox was until I started using Vanadium.
21:08:09 <crabman[m]> Will editing the “flash-all.sh” file work running on “4.15.0-109-generic” kernel?
21:08:32 <crabman[m]> I am trying to install Graphene for the first time to a new P3a. I followed all instructions but got the following error “fastboot too old;”. I am using the latest fastboot “platform-tools_r30.0.3-linux”. My OS is UbuntuMate 18.04, kernel 4.15.0-109-generic. I don’t have a windows PC readily available. The troubleshooting video suggested editing the “flash-all.sh” file, however, the video only dealt with 
21:08:32 <crabman[m]> editing the “flash-all.sh” file work for me, or am I out of luck due to my kernel version?
21:09:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hi crabman[m], can you do 'which fastboot' for me?
21:09:19 <TheJollyRoger> Please don't edit the flash-all.sh file.
21:09:33 <TheJollyRoger> That check for fastboot being too old isto prevent an incorrectly versioned version of fastboot from /bricking your device./
21:11:04 <TheJollyRoger> I would probably suggest you update to 20.04. It's possible to get this to work on other operating systems but I would try upgrading to a supported operating system first.
21:11:17 <crabman[m]> TheJollyRoger give me a minute to reboot
21:11:29 <TheJollyRoger> Sure.
21:13:04 <TheJollyRoger> I'm going to fathom a guess you may have inadvertently installed both versions of fastboot.
21:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> But we're about to find out.
21:14:58 <crabman[m]> TheJollyRoger  "which fastboot" just returns a prompt
21:15:15 <crabman[m]> same for sudo which fastboot
21:15:22 <TheJollyRoger> Let's see what "fastboot --version" returns then?
21:15:53 <TheJollyRoger> If you're getting "command not found" you're actually in good shape, since now we can download the official fastboot and add it to your path.
21:16:23 <crabman[m]> fastboot version 30.0.3-6597393
21:17:16 <crabman[m]> Now all I did was unzip the files and running from that directory.  I did not install the suite into the OS
21:18:03 <TheJollyRoger> Sure. It's in your command path, correct? That's all you'll need.
21:18:20 <TheJollyRoger> I /would/ try this on a supported operating system first though.
21:18:45 <TheJollyRoger> Since some older kernels before 5 don't support USB 3.1 all that well.
21:19:17 <crabman[m]> So a different command than "./flash-all.sh" ?
21:19:26 <fll[m]> crabman: did you relog after adding the directory with fastboot inside to your $PATH before the last flash attempt?
21:19:30 <crabman[m]> All files are in the same directory
21:19:53 <TheJollyRoger> crabman[m]: what's in your command path or $PATH?
21:19:58 <jknsec[m]> Does Discord on GrapheneOS work and if it does is it a security risk?
21:21:11 <CaptainPicard[m]> jknsec: I believe the app itself works, but the notifications will not as they rely on play services to work. If you're concerned about privacy/security concerns run it in its own user profile
21:21:52 <crabman[m]> UM18:/media/jaybo/MultiMedia/Android/Pixel3a/platform-tools$ ./fastboot --version
21:21:53 <crabman[m]> fastboot version 30.0.3-6597393
21:21:53 <crabman[m]> Installed as /media/jaybo/MultiMedia/Android/Pixel3a/platform-tools/fastboot
21:21:56 <haran> Hi All, I am looking for a good app that record phone call. I used to use boldbeast and it was great until google blocked the feature. Is there any equivalent app that work in grapheneos?
21:23:47 <TheJollyRoger> crabman[m]: If that's in your path and path is set properly, I would probably try on 20.04 first.
21:24:01 <TheJollyRoger> Gotta scoot for a moment. Be back later.
21:24:51 <fll[m]> haran: I don't think there is since its blocked. I used Call Recorder from fdroid and put calls on loudspeaker and only record mic. That is a workaround
21:27:23 <crabman[m]> TheJollyRoger I would hold off updating OS for a while if possible,  I can move files to any path.  I know 20.04 just came out a few months ago, long after Graphene.
21:28:02 <crabman[m]> Maybe I don't understand setting the path, all files, adb, and romare in the same directory
21:30:14 <crabman[m]> <fll[m] "crabman: did you relog after add"> Not sure I understand, all files are located in the same dir
21:30:18 <g65434-2[m]> helo
21:30:18 <fll[m]> crabman: path in this case means that it is included as an environment variable (I think that's what it's called) so that the command fastboot will always use this file, no matter from where it is executed (script)
21:32:42 <fll[m]> crabman: that's what this line is for: export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
21:32:58 <crabman[m]> Understand, I have not set any path, before I search howto, is it easy to explain how?
21:33:36 <fll[m]> You can add it in your bash config
21:33:49 <crabman[m]> <fll[m] "crabman: that's what this line i"> Where would that line go
21:34:47 <crabman[m]> I see above now
21:35:27 <fll[m]> That line above is not for the .bash_profile file though.
21:35:57 <crabman[m]> <fll[m] "You can add it in your bash conf"> Thanks.  I will go away now and give it a shot and report back.  Thanks!
21:36:18 <fll[m]> You can either type the line above into terminal or add the location with new fastboot manually to Nash profile
22:01:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW my matrix provider is going to wipe the server
22:02:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you need to contact me urgently https://t.me/clannad
22:02:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Matrix will be backed up and restored
22:04:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll let you know when the actual wipe happens
22:45:07 <go_fish[m]> Just so I'm 100% sure, I need to purchase the unlocked pixel directly, right? I can't make one bought from Verizon work with Graphene?
22:47:15 <M32NAANN6C> it needs to be unlocked
22:47:23 <M32NAANN6C>  * it needs to be purchased unlocked
22:50:26 <go_fish[m]> <M32NAANN6C "it needs to be unlocked"> Got it, thank you.
22:51:35 <nickcalyx[m]> The e Verizon version cant have its bootloader unlocked
22:52:21 <go_fish[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "The e Verizon version cant have "> that's disappointing. I wish carriers wouldn't do that.
22:53:26 <go_fish[m]> also, I recall some time ago android stopped supporting audio output over USB, is this still the case or is there some hardware requirement for it?
23:00:16 <dazinism> go_fish: pixel 3 & 4 have no audio jack, but have digital audio over usb
23:00:24 <dazinism> Pixel 3a has an audio jack
23:00:40 <dazinism> Not sure if audio works over usb as well?
23:00:47 <cdesai> it does iirc
23:00:50 <cdesai> same adapter works
23:02:31 <go_fish[m]> Cool
23:02:31 <dazinism> Need a DAC to get the noise. Some phones have dodgy quality analogue over USB instead
23:03:04 <dazinism> Pixel 3&4 come with usb - female jack
23:03:16 <dazinism> Also usb headphones
23:03:19 <go_fish[m]> This specifically is what I'm talking about, I have kind of a hacky solution for phone audio in my car and I use USB audio for it, android 9 killed the feature on my old note 8: https://support.google.com/android/thread/20187567?hl=en
23:06:42 <dazinism> go_fish: thats weird, someone in the thread you linked said no digi audio on the 3XL
23:07:24 <dazinism> Maybe its different to how it was done previously?
23:07:46 <dazinism> Definately need a DAC
23:07:57 <go_fish[m]> I know for a fact it still works into headphones vi an andapter, I'm wondering if it requires some kind of signing or other communication with devices not identified as headphones?
23:08:09 <go_fish[m]>  * I know for a fact it still works into headphones via an andapter, I'm wondering if it requires some kind of signing or other communication with devices not identified as headphones?
23:09:51 <dazinism> I've got a 3XL and I definately get audio out my USB
