00:22:07 <ghost_matrix[m]> What is the best way to take advantage of user profiles?
00:22:07 <ghost_matrix[m]> Or is it ok the use the owner profile as my day to day profile?
00:22:25 <ghost_matrix[m]> I just realised I was able to make new users
00:22:57 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption explains why you might want to use another profile as your main one
00:23:13 <strcat[m]> lot of other information available from the @GrapheneOS Twitter account and elsewhere
00:25:00 <ghost_matrix[m]> OK I see, will set it up now thanks
00:31:39 <jpds> Is there a way to make all these different profiles go through the same VPN tunnel?
00:32:49 <LinusSexTips[m]> just install your vpn client on each profile?
00:33:37 <jpds> LinusSexTips[m]: Yes, but my VPN provider doesn't let me have that many clients
00:33:49 <Snowstorm> Wait does Graphene have profiles?
00:34:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
00:34:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> We have 16 user profiles
00:35:38 <LinusSexTips[m]> you can have that many?
00:35:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> I only use three
00:37:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Linus Sex Tips: you can have 32
00:37:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> A work profile inside every user profile
00:39:13 <justanotherlurke> <anupritaisno1[m] "A work profile inside every user"> Work profiles by using the shelter app?
00:39:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
00:39:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw not really recommended
00:40:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> When you do something like a work profile, the app owns the profile and not you
00:40:49 <justanotherlurke> Was thinking of incarcerating WhatsApp in it. ..
00:41:32 <justanotherlurke> ...so shelter owning ( just) that would not be too bad.
00:41:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It is
00:42:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Compromising shelter should be much easier than compromising the system
00:44:18 <justanotherlurke> Would a compromised shelter just affect that work profile, or potentially the whole system? Thought the further...
00:45:06 <justanotherlurke> ...and anything with WhatsApp in it is kind of compromised anyway..
00:46:20 <strcat[m]> jpds: they aren't really separate clients, it'd be pretty weird if they didn't let you do that since only 1 is connected at a time
00:46:45 <strcat[m]> if their app is problematic use WireGuard's app or an OpenVPN app to connect
00:51:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> justanotherlurker: work profiles aren't really as strong isolation as user profiles
00:56:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> * justanotherlurker: work profiles aren't really as strong as user profiles when it comes to isolation
00:57:47 <justanotherlurke> <anupritaisno1[m] "justanotherlurker: work profiles"> Thanks - then I will probably give WhatsApp its own user and live with not getting notifications while working as the main (secondary, not owner) user.
01:02:06 <jpds> strcat[m]: it's just tedious to have to copy the same config to say 10 different profiles
01:02:56 <justanotherlurke> So that's four users then: owner (user admin), user (normal stuff), untrusted/prison ( e.g. WhatsApp with contact list limited to other WhatsApp users) and safe (e.g.banking) - does that make sense?
01:03:46 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: not really, banking sounds like part of your usual personal identity
01:03:53 <strcat[m]> unless you have a specific reason to put it in another profile
01:03:58 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed
01:04:05 <strcat[m]> profiles do not provide a stronger sandbox, that's not what they do
01:04:15 <strcat[m]> they're isolated workspaces, the app sandbox is still what contains apps either way
01:05:05 <strcat[m]> the purpose of profiles is having different sets of shared data
01:05:15 <asfassa> Hello. I was hoping to find out if grapheneOS participates in any USA covid tracking features from within the OS? I'm hoping not. Sorry, I'm only a little techy--hope I asked this right.
01:05:22 <strcat[m]> apps are always sandboxed, that's not a choice or something requiring manual setup
01:05:39 <strcat[m]> asfassa: no, it doesn't, read usage guide / FAQ
01:06:03 <asfassa> usage guide! thanks so much!!!!!!
01:06:55 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
01:07:38 <strcat[m]> asfassa: the only way you can use those kinds of apps is if you install one designed to work without Play services and give it access to Location in the background (for Bluetooth device scanning)
01:09:33 <asfassa> I don't want any app/feature like that... your answers make me glad... don't want any kind of Play services stuff. I've run Lineage w/o gapps and I life it that way
01:14:47 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "the purpose of profiles is havin"> Thanks for the explanation. One ( stupid)  banking app needs Google play services, though, that's why I was thinking of keeping it separated. Until your implementation of microg (?)   is ready, that is...
01:15:30 <asfassa> btw, thanks for the RAPID responses! I hope to be trying out you amazing OS soon. Cheers :]
01:16:55 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: still doesn't make sense
01:17:04 <Thatcher[m]> <asfassa "btw, thanks for the RAPID respon"> Graphene is a delightfully pure experience!
01:17:20 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: GrapheneOS doesn't have Play services
01:17:31 <strcat[m]> if that app has a hard dependency on Play services it's just not going to work
01:18:02 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: think you're confused - you don't have the option to use Play services right now, either the official Play services or a reimplementation of those Google service APIs like microG
01:18:10 <strcat[m]> if the app has a hard dependency and won't work without it, you can't use it
01:18:19 <strcat[m]> don't know what profiles have to do with it
01:18:47 <strcat[m]> once we support installing microG as a user app then you could have a specific profile with microG for apps that don't work without Play services but you don't have that as an option right now
01:18:53 <strcat[m]> so I don't really understand what you're describing
01:20:11 <TheJollyRoger> If an app requires Google services, what happens is that that the app will most likely abruptly halt when the app tries to dial out, not find the functionality it wants because GrapheneOS lacks Google Software Frameworks, and then the app will exit (or simply crash).
01:21:24 <TheJollyRoger> It might say "cannot use Google Play Services. This app will now exit" prior to stopping.

01:23:53 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "once we support installing micro"> You are right, that's exactly what I misunderstood: thought GPS or microg was not included, but possible. So this banking app will  have to wait for your microg - no problem. And I need one use less user for now.
01:25:44 <strcat[m]> justanotherlurker: only if it can work with the small subset of Play services implemented by microG
01:31:46 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "justanotherlurker: only if it ca"> Well, if it does not work, I will learn to live without this banking app. Probably even spend less money that way. üòâ
01:32:30 <strcat[m]> if you haven't tested it, you shouldn't assume it won't work without Play services
01:33:18 <TheJollyRoger> The instruments on GrapheneOS are working, but some apps do it the lazy way and simply get their location via functionality that Google Play provides. I don't know why they do this but I can presume it must be easier for them to do so.
01:40:34 <justanotherlurke> <strcat[m] "if you haven't tested it, you sh"> Tested to not work on a kindle fire without Google services, asked the bank and they confirmed the dependency. But does not matter much, security comes first.

01:49:14 <moonarch20[m]> Is anyone else having complaints about call quality with grapheneos? I installed it just recently when I bought a pixel 4a and most people I call have been complaining that it is hard to hear me. I tested the mic with a voice recording app and it comes up clear on that so maybe it is just the phone application?
01:49:28 <moonarch20[m]> I had a note 9 prior and there was never any complaints on call quality
01:53:51 <strcat[m]> sounds like an issue specific to you
01:54:31 <strcat[m]> maybe your carrier doesn't support VoLTE with AOSP and you had it before
01:54:49 <strcat[m]> we'll be shipping expanded carrier-specific configurations soon to provide better support for VoLTE/VoWiFi
01:54:56 <TheJollyRoger> moonarch20[m]: I haven't experienced any call quality issues over the Publicly Switched Telephone Network or on instant messaging apps.
01:55:09 <strcat[m]> if you want consistent high quality calls though, use something better than legacy insecure calls
01:57:18 <moonarch20[m]> Interesting
01:57:33 <moonarch20[m]> So something like Signal should get better audio quality?
01:57:37 <strcat[m]> yes
01:57:43 <strcat[m]> it will have consistently better call quality
01:57:59 <strcat[m]> because it's using WebRTC with high quality codecs and higher bandwidth
01:58:28 <strcat[m]> VoLTE call quality is okay but VoLTE is often not available, often requires carrier apps, etc. integrated into the OS
01:58:41 <moonarch20[m]> Gotcha, appreciate the help. This is just one more reason to push my friends/family to get signal
01:59:00 <moonarch20[m]> I've been trying for awhile but most of them like the stock iOS messaging app better
02:01:07 <TheJollyRoger> moonarch20[m]: Yes, signal will have consistently better quality.
02:01:13 <TheJollyRoger> The pain is real on network effect though!
02:02:50 <adjism> strcat: https://redandblack.io/blog/2020/using-google-camera-on-grapheneos/ ... this article shows how to install microG as an app from F-DROID in grapheneOS and use it without any permissions.
02:03:20 <strcat[m]> no, microG is not working like that
02:03:55 <strcat[m]> you could also install the more minimal app providing that placeholder, which isn't going to be broken
02:04:10 <strcat[m]> either way strongly recommend against installing an app with that name in a regular profile
02:04:15 <adjism> strcat: btw I still cannot try that thing since my pixel 4a hasn't arrived yet
02:04:21 <strcat[m]> adjism: it's really bad advice not actually explaining what's happening and why
02:04:25 <strcat[m]> and the consequences of it
02:05:35 <strcat[m]> microG does not work installed as a regular user app without OS integration for it
02:05:42 <strcat[m]> you're misinterpreting what's happening there
02:06:16 <strcat[m]> and if you have something like that installed, other apps are going to be trying to use it, despite it not working
02:06:28 <strcat[m]> and it's going to break them, and then you'll be here asking for help with problems you've caused
02:07:10 <adjism> I'm not asking for support on that just that asked if that article is valid... since I cannot try that for the moment
02:07:19 <adjism> And I understand your points around this
02:07:27 <strcat[m]> I don't think you do
02:07:34 <strcat[m]> adjism: no, it's not, it's bad advice and is not explaining what's happening
02:08:12 <adjism> k
02:08:28 <adjism> I was not advertising the article
02:08:54 <adjism> just wondering if you could "fake" having gapps so at least not receive the error from google play services
02:09:13 <strcat[m]> > and if you have something like that installed, other apps are going to be trying to use it, despite it not working
02:09:16 <strcat[m]> > and it's going to break them, and then you'll be here asking for help with problems you've caused
02:09:53 <strcat[m]> adjism: if you install microG, it's going to be completely broken / non-functional
02:10:14 <strcat[m]> adjism: some apps are going to attempt to use it instead of their alternative approach when Play services isn't available
02:10:18 <adjism> then I will not install it, thank you for the help
02:10:58 <strcat[m]> if you've determined to use Google Camera then install it in a profile dedicated to it with that minimal fake Play services app
02:11:07 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't interfere with other apps
02:11:18 <strcat[m]> don't use microG, it will be broken
02:11:42 <strcat[m]> either way not something that's supported or that's likely to continue working
02:12:56 <strcat[m]>  * if you're determined to use Google Camera then install it in a profile dedicated to it with that minimal fake Play services app
02:13:29 <adjism> got it

03:46:21 <LavenderKush16> Have you downloaded the latest version of Fastboot from the Installation guide URL?
03:46:22 <LavenderKush16> Try that
03:46:38 <ghost_matrix[m]> Debian and Ubuntu:¬†android-sdk-platform-tools-common¬†provides udev rules allowing fastboot and adb to work in local sessions without root. The udev rules in Debian and Ubuntu are out-of-date, but it has the necessary entries for Pixel phones. The adb and fastboot packages are currently both broken and far too out-of-date to be any use, so avoid those. The version check in the flashing script will prevent

04:07:49 <TheJollyRoger> (most of the versions of fastboot packaged by distributions don't support autodetection and are incorrectly versioned, this tends to lead to softbricking.)
04:08:08 <narcoli[m]> <TheJollyRoger "narcoli: stop right there, you'v"> how do I fix this
04:08:58 <TheJollyRoger> You must have installed it via your operating system's repositories, you'll need to uninstall that version. I assume you're running debian, mint, or ubuntu?

04:09:14 <narcoli[m]> its ubuntu
04:09:47 <TheJollyRoger> ghost_matrix[m]: please don't use the version of android platform tools in debian or ubuntu. They don't support autodetection and may result in an unbootable device.
04:10:25 <TheJollyRoger> You installed it via apt? You should be able to remove it via apt.
04:10:41 <narcoli[m]> yes I installed it that way
04:10:53 <narcoli[m]> what is the command to uninstall?
04:11:20 <narcoli[m]> sudo apt uninstall?
04:11:28 <TheJollyRoger> it's the same, except replace "apt install" with "apt remove". So for instance, "sudo apt remove my-program" would remove "my-program".
04:11:54 <TheJollyRoger> So if you installed android-sdk-platform-tools via apt, then the command to remove it is "sudo apt remove android-sdk-platform-tools"

04:29:07 <narcoli[m]> im going to start fresh tmrw thanks for all your help

04:30:56 <ghost_matrix[m]> Good luck
04:31:38 <TheJollyRoger> ghost_matrix[m]: doing so with that probably was what installed that unwanted fastboot onto his computer which he now can't uninstall.
04:31:50 <TheJollyRoger> And now I'm not exactly sure why (again, not an Ubuntu or PopOS user)
04:32:41 <TheJollyRoger> So the better way is to simply obtain the udev rules from upstream and add those directly to /etc/udev/rules.d/ - At least this way he knows what he's getting and only obtains what he needs, exactly.
04:33:51 <TheJollyRoger> The command shell reads the items in PATH in order.
04:34:28 <TheJollyRoger> So, in your case, you prepended the working directory to your existing path, and likely that's why it found fastboot first and that's why it worked for you. But, I don't know why fastboot won't leave his computer now.
04:34:38 <TheJollyRoger> *why it found the correct fastboot
04:36:41 <TheJollyRoger> Will return shortly.

04:38:44 <ghost_matrix[m]> Also not sure why he can't uninstall it either
04:40:46 <ghost_matrix[m]> He must have Installed the wrong fastboot or added the wrong one to his $PATH.
04:41:47 <ghost_matrix[m]> I guess that's why it mentions to double check your --version
04:45:43 <strcat[m]> narcoli: follow the official guide at https://grapheneos.org/install including the instructions on obtaining fastboot

05:56:58 <Guest58324> What requirements must a smartphone pass in order to be compatible with grapheneos? the google pixel 5 i see that it is not compatible. It is not compatible because it is a new phone and it will still take time or does it not meet the requirements?
05:57:22 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
05:57:35 <strcat[m]> Guest58324: supporting a device properly is a substantial undertaking
05:57:39 <strcat[m]> it's all explained there
05:57:54 <strcat[m]> better to read the detailed documentation on the site than get an incomplete answer here
06:00:14 <Guest58324> I still don't understand. I am Spanish and I don't understand much English. the translator is bad. Grapheneos will arrive for pixel 5 or not?
06:06:15 <strcat[m]> did you read the sections at https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support ?
06:06:46 <strcat[m]> I don't think language barrier is the issue
06:07:00 <strcat[m]> you're going to get the same answer here as what's on the site
06:07:18 <strcat[m]> > The Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 aren't currently supported.
06:07:31 <strcat[m]> read https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices in particular
06:08:00 <strcat[m]> > In order to support a device, the appropriate resources also need to be available and dedicated towards it. Releases for each supported device need to be robust and stable, with all standard functionality working properly and testing for each of the releases.
06:08:07 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#when-devices
06:08:17 <strcat[m]> > Broader device support can only happen after the community (companies, organizations and individuals) steps up to make substantial, ongoing contributions to making the existing device support sustainable. Once the existing device support is more sustainable, early research and development work for other devices can begin. Once a device is deemed to be a worthwhile target, the project needs maintainers to develop and
06:08:17 <strcat[m]> maintain support for it including addressing device-specific issues that are uncovered, which will include issues uncovered in the device support code by GrapheneOS hardening features.
06:08:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are working on supporting pixel 5 but there are serious issues that need to be fixed first
06:08:41 <strcat[m]> Guest58324: I think the content on the site covers this all quite well, I don't see a need to paraphrase it here
06:29:43 <pakoloko> and what differences are there between graphene and calyxos to make graphene safer?
06:43:45 <Liakdeuser[m]> <pakoloko "and what differences are there b"> Suggest asking that instead in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for OS comparisons and refrain from doing it here
06:44:01 <Liakdeuser[m]> But for GrapheneOS, summary of features are in grapheneos.org/features
06:44:32 <louipcm> How to make device support sustainable? More maintainers?
06:44:44 <Liakdeuser[m]> Yeah
06:45:23 <Liakdeuser[m]> Also needs a maintainer who has powerful enough workstation tbh
06:46:00 <Liakdeuser[m]> maintainers* rather for each device
06:47:34 <louipcm> need a grapheneos reference build machine :D
06:48:07 <somenerd[m]> sounds nice lol
06:55:12 <Liakdeuser[m]> Maybe some day
07:14:26 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <anupritaisno1[m] "Run the upgrade assistant"> Interesting, weren't they charging for licenses for a bit? Ty!
07:14:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <Liakdeuser[m] "Also needs a maintainer who has "> Hopefully secure enough, as well
07:28:45 <ayaen_t[m]> Lia (kde user):  its almost like a conspiracy . the ones powerful enough wont have secure oses and the ones that run secure oses like mac chromeos are barely powerful enough or way tooooo costly
07:32:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Heh. TheJollyRoger may have some insight on these tradeoffs. He's got a pretty dope setup.
07:33:19 <ayaen_t[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: yes .
07:33:47 <ayaen_t[m]> and it costs as much as dope too.
07:36:19 <ayaen_t[m]> but if ones got the resources money,mentality his setup is the one to go for.

07:44:19 <ayaen_t[m]> well thats good to know but for me i primarily want a system to build grapheneOS.
07:44:31 <lawsofthermodyna> Is there a way to install apps on the work profile and use it? Or is it still mostly being developed?
07:51:06 <the5000[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: I hope it's real look it up
08:01:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <lawsofthermodyna "Is there a way to install apps o"> You can use as many guest profiles as you'd like.
08:01:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> In fact, using a second profile as your main is being recommended.
08:04:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> See Security and Privacy section here https://grapheneos.org/faq
08:05:38 <strcat[m]> you can link to the sections by clicking the headers or the entry in the table of contents btw
08:05:48 <strcat[m]> like https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
08:06:21 <strcat[m]> just uses html ids and is what URL fragments (#whatever) do by default
08:08:29 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Totally forgot about that, thx man...for the reader, this works for Wikipedia and many other forward thinking wiki-style pages as well!
08:09:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Hope you're well, strcat. Night all!
08:13:48 <lawsofthermodyna> So does using shelter somehow reduce privacy?
08:16:28 <somenerd[m]> it's mostly unnecessary
08:16:37 <somenerd[m]> and the app controls the profile
08:18:27 <lawsofthermodyna> Well if I only want it for a single app it's much more convenient than having to constantly switch profiles
08:19:18 <lawsofthermodyna> At least IMO so if it doesn't actually hurt privacy then I'll probably just stick to that
08:20:16 <ayaen_t[m]> you could always use something like classyshark3xodus to check your app for known tracker classes in the apps code
08:20:29 <somenerd[m]> eh, that's mostly known trackers
08:20:37 <ayaen_t[m]> that helps to some extent
08:20:43 <somenerd[m]> first party tracking may be there
08:20:47 <somenerd[m]> also https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles#Shelter
08:20:52 <ayaen_t[m]> atleast one is aware
08:20:57 <somenerd[m]> and maybe come over to #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
08:21:05 <ayaen_t[m]> yes
08:22:21 <lawsofthermodyna> How is this off topic? It's directly grapheneOS related. Or is this room only for installation assistance?
08:23:06 <somenerd[m]> It's becoming more about shelter and trackers
08:24:28 <somenerd[m]> so I suggested moving to the offtopic room
08:24:50 <ayaen_t[m]> laws of thermodynamics debunked by fat people if we go offtopic it might get in the way of someone who comes here for some troubleshooting
08:27:52 <lawsofthermodyna> You nerds really cannot into conversation. Is there another way to install apps into the work profile provided by grapheneOS without shelter or is that the only way?
08:29:17 <ayaen_t[m]> dear man , please ask , dont demand.
08:30:13 <lawsofthermodyna> Whatever I figured it out on my own thanks to the search feature.
09:52:28 <fll[m]> Question that is more of a general android question than graphene: DefaultCarrierApp got its permissions removed automatically due to not being used for some time. Could that become an issue?
09:52:55 <somenerd[m]> in what way? the app breaking?
09:53:26 <somenerd[m]> or is the permission being removed an issue? (it's a feature)
09:53:31 <somenerd[m]> also kinda off topic
09:53:41 <somenerd[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org ?
09:56:48 <fll[m]> I guess my question is what does CarrierDefaultApp do?
09:56:56 <nscnt> It's not offtopic imo. It's a system app. If it actually breaks something, you need to do work on the operating system's level
09:57:14 <somenerd[m]> true I guess
09:57:33 <nscnt> fll[m]: Not sure, to be honest. I've got that, too
10:00:18 <nscnt> I think the doc is this: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/oob-users
10:01:20 <nscnt> "The default carrier app is configured to provide a better experience for unconfigured carriers out of the box. Carriers can use this default behavior."
10:02:47 <strcat> if it revoked it
10:02:52 <strcat> it means your carrier doesn't use it
10:03:06 <strcat> if you switch to a carrier that doesn't have proper configuration and needs it I guess it might break with that revoked
10:03:18 <strcat> it doesn't seem to know how to ask for the permission again
10:03:52 <fll[m]> Ah ok, thx. So it would only have a chance of being relevant if I change my carrier
10:04:01 <pumpkineater69[m> How is Vanadium more secure than something like Bromite
10:04:19 <fll[m]> I'm too slow typing :P

12:41:17 <dazinism> If I remember correctly you'll get extra options in the accessibilty settings page if you got an app installed that can act as an accessibilty service
12:42:32 <dazinism> duggalsu: no had some issues with tts acting a bit weird over recent months. Maybe due to the tts app and/or changes with Android 11

19:19:00 <textmate> Im installing GrapheneOS on a Pixel 4a. Want to recommend people that it says on the docs that you need internet, it did not work until I restarted it after having connected to internet first.
19:20:09 <textmate> maybe someone can add this to the docs?
19:20:34 <nscnt> textmate: Internet for what?
19:22:30 <nscnt> You need internet access to enable the Developer options. That's it and that's written in the guide
19:25:13 <textmate> nscnt:read my message again pls
19:25:31 <textmate> And youre also wrong, although I think I know what you meant.
19:27:27 <nscnt> I've read your message over and over. Seems like I still don't understand what you meant. Could you rephrase it?
19:28:20 <nscnt> You don't need to restart or anything. There's nothing to add to the docs
19:29:34 <nscnt> And yeah, I meant to enable OEM unlocking
19:31:45 <textmate> nscnt:Yes
19:32:12 <textmate> When I attempted to OEM unlock, it didnt work and it was obviously becuase I hadnt connected to internet before, so I did
19:32:26 <textmate> However, it was still grayed out until I restarted the device.
19:32:32 <textmate> Thats all im saying
19:32:50 <textmate> You need to restart the device after connecting to internet for it to become an available option.
19:33:18 <nscnt> Would be the first time for me hearing that after all this time
19:33:38 <textmate> Well atleast that was my experience, on a Pixel 4a
19:35:35 <textmate> haha I guess I managed to brick it
19:36:12 <nscnt> textmate: It's hard to brick

19:46:33 <nscnt> Not sure. You're both using a not officially supported operating system and a (as stated by yourself) a bad cable
19:46:53 <nscnt> There are many variables

19:50:32 <nscnt> Trying to flash from a VM isn't recommended as well. Doesn't matter what the host is
19:54:45 <textmate> It is, just that I need to essentially attach the USB device to the specific VM

20:26:58 <Spartan117> Hallo
20:27:22 <Spartan117> What VPNs do you guys reccomend
20:28:07 <eu> protonvpn
20:29:14 <dar_gomml[m]> offtopic
20:31:42 <Spartan127> Hallo, what's are the best VPNs to use with GOS
20:35:19 <fll[m]> Spartan127: first off all: that question is something for grapheme off topic channel. Secondly, there's no such thing as "best VPN". Totally depends on why you need a VPN.
20:47:00 <textmate> btw
20:47:15 <textmate> is it not possible to remove the "You are loading a custom OS" warning at boot?
20:47:42 <nscnt> textmate: No, it's not possible
20:47:58 <textmate> nscnt:what about the google logo
20:48:12 <nscnt> Same thing
20:50:30 <textmate> I know on some Samsung devices this is possible
20:50:50 <nscnt> Not here
20:52:41 <nscnt> It's a hardware thing and can't be changed
20:55:11 <nscnt> The warning is part of the bootloader security and expected
20:55:24 <textmate> ok
21:30:03 <Alex16847> Hallo

21:42:33 <diotitus> Hello
21:45:11 <diotitus> Hi. I just wanted inquire on if GrapheneOS had support for a custom hosts file to block certain domains via a method such as Adb root. Thanks.
21:45:51 <sb13x[m]> Alex16847: https://grapheneos.org/faq#vpn-support
21:48:22 <strcat[m]> diotitus: hosts file really isn't a reasonable way to do ad-blocking, libc scans it line by line for every DNS request and it's part of the system image
21:48:39 <strcat[m]> it's not meant to have more than a couple entries to set up localhost
21:48:46 <strcat[m]> it shouldn't really exist at all anymore
21:56:13 <diotitus> Alright thank you.
22:00:56 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking
22:36:16 <Baobab> The best way to ad block is not visit websites that give you ads (^_^)
22:37:06 <Baobab> The best way to ad block is not to visit the websites that give you ads in the first place (^_^)
22:37:33 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#ad-blocking says how to do system wide ad-blocking
22:37:36 <strcat[m]> doesn't require any horrible hacks
23:27:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys a lot of misinformation is being spread about graphene. Please pm me if you would like to help us against it
23:40:33 <textmate> uhhhh
23:40:34 <textmate> guys

23:45:47 <louipc> textmate: can't you boot into bootloader and reset?
23:46:36 <encryptocat> Hi everyone, i have a pixel 4 and i am using 2 profiles, onlt every time i switch from the second to the main , it takes about 1 minute before i can enter it, background stays black etc , anyone knows why this happen?

23:48:48 <textmate> I will try to.
23:49:06 <louipc> kewl
23:49:16 <encryptocat> From main to second always goes smoothly, only the other way around not
23:49:29 <louipc> it will wipe your data btw
23:51:38 <textmate> louipc:From what I see I cant enter the recovery mode
23:52:17 <textmate> All I do is get to the "No command" screen
