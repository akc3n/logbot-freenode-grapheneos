00:04:00 <nickcalyx[m]> I hope my pixel 4A's come soon
00:11:28 <renlord> weee
00:14:43 <cdesai> same
00:14:57 <aeonsolution[m]> yup
00:17:51 <brockin042[m]> Pixel xl 2 states legacy. Does that mean it won't be supported soon?
00:19:12 <renlord> double cheer
00:19:25 <renlord> brockin042[m]: pixel2 is EOL, its not supported anymore
00:23:37 <aeonsolution[m]> brockin042: here are the details from Google support <https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en>
00:25:15 <aeonsolution[m]> strcat also added in a convo that the pixel 1 family "got 1 year and 2 months extra of major OS updates, 2 months of extra sec updates" so think of the EOL as the minimum guarantee for support of the device
00:25:39 <aeonsolution[m]> its in the logs, hope that helps
00:26:05 <brockin042[m]> Pixel xl 2 says October
00:26:29 <brockin042[m]> It's still such a great phone.
00:27:26 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "strcat also added in a convo tha"> kinda the Pixel 1 skipped a month
00:27:36 <cn3m[m]> I think it only had medium severity issues
00:29:59 <aeonsolution[m]> brockin042: i would also like to add that, i don't know what that means for GrapheneOS support on the legacy labeled Pixels since there isn't a dedicated maintainer for the device
00:30:33 <aeonsolution[m]> the migration to Android 11 and preparing the new devices is probably going to be a bigger priority in the coming months
00:31:11 <cdesai> less than a month before a new release isn't exactly the best time to add device support
00:31:32 <cdesai> but less than a month before a new release means that it's still running the current release and thus it's just one thing to deal with
00:31:35 <aeonsolution[m]> ^
00:32:28 <brockin042[m]> I guess its time to upgrade.
00:59:21 <abff> does anyone know who is responsible for patching these DSP vulnerabilities on the pixel line of phones? Is it foxconn? https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/08/06/achilles-small-chip-big-peril/
01:00:00 <JTL> Qualcomm I believe.
01:00:35 <abff> JTL I mean who will distribute it I guess
01:00:51 <abff> I know qualcomm has released a fix but that still has to deseminate to the end user
01:06:27 <aeonsolution[m]> abff: check this out https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1292398497677877249
01:07:50 <aeonsolution[m]> you can also follow the convo on the topic here <https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200811>
01:12:40 <aeonsolution[m]> thank you for raising the concern btw
01:20:04 <abff> aeonsolution[m]: lets hope there's an easy to implement solution
01:20:56 <aeonsolution[m]> its already implemented via the GrapheneOS SELinux rules
01:21:08 <aeonsolution[m]> check out the covo, its really cool stuff
01:21:18 <abff> I will I will
01:21:56 <abff> I read the release notes for the august 5th sec level from google and it didn't say anything about those cves so I started to get worried
01:22:00 <abff> haha sweet
01:23:06 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: I have to be careful on the subreddit when I get these questions. So definitely GrapheneOS is not effected?
01:23:31 <cn3m[m]> I basically said I didn't know, but the patch from Qualcomm would come soon and remove all doubt
01:24:41 <aeonsolution[m]> it might be more accurate to say Pixel SELinux rules, I'm going by strcat's explanations or at least what i interpret because i still have some gaps in knowledge there
01:24:58 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, i feel you
01:25:00 <abff> That's how I'd understand it too
01:25:30 <abff> but the dsp gets used for tons of things, could probably infect a phone just scrolling through instagram
01:25:56 <abff> I told my gf to leave her phone off for a week -.-
01:26:03 <cn3m[m]> okay I will stay vague aeonsolution:
01:26:17 <cn3m[m]> I don't feel an Apple right now and want to debunk Mail vulnerabilities xD
01:26:30 <cn3m[m]> way out of my league
01:26:50 <aeonsolution[m]> why can't we just download the knowledge right
01:29:47 <aeonsolution[m]> <cn3m[m] "way out of my league "> we'll get there 💪
01:31:22 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "we'll get there 💪"> yes we will! thankfully
01:45:35 <aeonsolution[m]> credit goes to strcat and the devs that help make it happen, you can show support by being a tester or donating to the project if you able too
01:46:03 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/donate
01:48:09 <renlord> how does scrolling thru instagram use the dsp?
01:51:12 <JTL> On a tangent, what *does* use the DSP?
01:52:08 <aeonsolution[m]> that's what i want to know too JTL ! 🤣
01:53:10 <aeonsolution[m]> Nice, thank you for supporting open source!
01:53:56 <JTL> Cheers
02:31:40 <strcat[m]> abff: the DSP is not used for a ton of things, you'
02:31:51 <strcat[m]>  * abff: the DSP is not used for a ton of things, you're spreading misinformed FUD which bannable
02:32:41 <strcat[m]> you were linked to a thread to read
02:34:01 <strcat[m]> it is hardly used by AOSP and in fact if we dropped support for it completely hardly anyone would notice anything missing since I doubt anyone here uses any app uses the NN API (which does NOT grant direct access to it)
02:34:31 <strcat[m]> other than that it's just used for the auto-wake sensor features and stuff we don't have tied into that
02:34:48 <strcat[m]> there is a thread about it which was linked
02:34:53 <strcat[m]> dunno why I'm repeating stuff here
02:34:59 <cn3m[m]> just to be clear this security vulnerability doesn't effect Pixels in general? I was slightly confused reading it
02:35:13 <strcat[m]> it is not accessible remotely or to apps
02:35:37 <strcat[m]> it's still a security vulnerability but it's not a big deal and the security company is just promoting themselves by spreading misinformation as always
02:35:57 <strcat[m]> on other phones perhaps it's more broadly accessible but it is not in AOSP / stock OS on Pixels
02:36:03 <cn3m[m]> thanks ^
02:36:29 <strcat[m]> yet another example of journalists doing a bad job and just repeating press releases + speculating on things in a dramatic way
02:36:36 <strcat[m]> ars story is a nice example
02:36:50 <strcat[m]> you can see from the SELinux policies that hardly anything uses it
02:37:15 <strcat[m]> the neural net API is the only non-core-OS usage and apps can only use it via the commands they can do via the NN API
02:37:19 <strcat[m]> they have no direct access
02:40:56 <cn3m[m]> That clears it up for me. I was confused by the indirect access. Thanks so much for clarifying 🙂
02:44:31 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/neuralnetworks#operations
03:03:57 <retry0x[m]> What security and longer term support do you get from a pixel 4 to a pixel 4a?
03:32:36 <renlord> what apps actually use the NN API?
04:13:53 <raheemwala[m]> https://revolte-attack.net/
06:45:02 <jalb> Hello. One question: when Daniel says that ad blockers are privacy theatre, do I understand that he means that it only protects you from seeing ads in your browser but not to track you?. In my understanding I suppose that the server continue receiving our data and so they can do what they want. So, when we think we are "blocking trackers" we're not, the only thing we're doing is to avoid seeing those ads, nothing more. Is this the meaning?. I read the logs.
06:45:02 <jalb>  Thanks a lot.
06:45:49 <jalb> Only asking to understand it better
06:48:41 <nobody123> Hi
06:55:37 <webber> With Achilles being a thing, will it affect GrapheneOS in any meaningful way?
06:57:35 <norisg> Hi, what is the update zip in the release notes?
06:57:52 <norisg> should I install both the normal zip and the update?
06:57:59 <norisg> or is the update the newest version
06:59:01 <cn3m[m]> jalb: The problem is when you think about it in a problem solving manner adblockers don't work for privacy(they are reliable at all) and they distract from fixing real issues for privacy
06:59:19 <cn3m[m]> it is best to understand it in security terms
06:59:46 <cn3m[m]> an adblocker is like anti virus
07:00:00 <cn3m[m]> if antivirus was good enough we would all be running an S4 with Norton
07:00:30 <cn3m[m]> adblocking does for privacy what antivirus does for security
07:03:16 <thematten[m]> cn3m I guess many people use adblockers for usability reasons - they remove a lot of clutter from websites
07:03:39 <cn3m[m]> yes
07:04:01 <cn3m[m]> it doesn't make sense however for projects like Tor or GrapheneOS out of the box though
07:04:14 <cn3m[m]> it is censorship with no concrete value for privacy and security
07:04:26 <cn3m[m]> yes it can help, but not in a technically sound way at all
07:04:42 <thematten[m]> 100% - it's pretty simple to set one up anyway
07:05:09 <cn3m[m]> exactly it is worst case censorship
07:05:18 <cn3m[m]> for what is in purely technical sense privacy and security theater
07:05:40 <cn3m[m]> which is country to visions of Tor Project or GrapheneOS
07:05:58 <cn3m[m]> These two are are probably the most critical of adblocking as a panacea
07:07:46 * cn3m[m] uploaded an image: image.png (155KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/privacytools.io/ZLSguTzXDKwjrEJrKmBnhoTv/image.png >
07:07:53 <cn3m[m]> I think Tor Project sums it up well
07:08:03 <cn3m[m]> https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#philosophy
07:12:56 <norisg> Hello guys, after installing grapheneOS on Pixel 3a, i am not able to leave fastboot mode, it says "no valid slot to boot"
07:13:06 <norisg> slot b
07:14:30 <norisg> now it says error booting boot.img
07:14:31 <cn3m[m]> what is the last thing you saw in your terminal
07:14:56 <norisg> ERROR: usb_write failed with status e00002c0
07:16:54 <norisg> ok I am trying the whole process again
07:17:23 <norisg> I think I interrupted the process when in when it went to fastbootd
07:20:03 <norisg> its working now, is it also ok to verify the zip file of the release by just sha256 it and compare it with the sig content, without using signify
07:26:13 <erhcetua[m]> <norisg "its working now, is it also ok t"> doesn't work
07:28:40 <norisg> erhcetua, ok you mean it is less secure, because the shasum can be compared
07:56:59 <norisg> is there a TOR browser available by default on graphene
07:57:16 <travankor_> no
07:59:02 <jalb> cn3m[m], thanks a lot. I couldn't read it before
07:59:45 <jalb> I get it now
08:01:37 <robocat[m]> So is the pixel 3a, going to be well supported and a good phone running grapheneOS
08:01:56 <robocat[m]> And whats the support on the 2 XL like
08:02:05 <robocat[m]> Thx in advance
08:03:08 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> 2(XL) support ends in like 2 months
08:11:26 <marlow11[m]> > 2(XL) support ends in like 2 months
08:11:26 <marlow11[m]> Is it the same for regular pixel 2?
08:13:22 <frenchieisverige> Yes. Same hardware inside, but smaller screen
09:19:35 <virgin_eagle[m]> Cmon)) kill CopperheadOS by implementing this feature first:
09:19:39 <virgin_eagle[m]> In vanilla Android, the encryption password is tied to the lockscreen password. That's the default in CopperheadOS, but there's full support for setting a separate encryption password. This allows for a convenient pattern, pin or password to be used for unlocking the screen while using a very strong encryption passphrase. If desired, the separate encryption password can be removed in favor of coupling it to the
09:19:39 <virgin_eagle[m]> lockscreen password again.
09:19:39 <virgin_eagle[m]> When a separate encryption password is set, the lockscreen will force a reboot after 5 failed unlocking attempts to force the entry of the encryption passphrase. This makes it possible to use a convenient unlocking method without brute force being feasible. It offers similar benefits as wiping after a given number of failures or using a fingerprint scanner without the associated drawbacks.
09:23:12 <cn3m[m]> virgin_eagle: that is marketing bs
09:24:12 <virgin_eagle[m]> I need it)
09:26:05 <cn3m[m]> the current is better and you can implement those features cleanly in the current setup
09:26:16 <virgin_eagle[m]> Modern cameras see your screen unlock pass
09:26:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Bet it's jus the legacy implementatiom of boot password and lockscreen password
09:27:19 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Bet it's just the legacy implementatiom of boot password and lockscreen password
09:27:32 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Bet it's just the legacy implementation of boot password and lockscreen password
09:28:26 <cn3m[m]> <virgin_eagle[m] "Modern cameras see your screen u"> GrapheneOS has two wonderful solutions for that
09:28:47 <virgin_eagle[m]> Pin scramble is tracable also:)))
09:29:29 <cn3m[m]> PINs can be scrambled
09:29:32 <cn3m[m]> and biometrics
09:29:34 <cn3m[m]> wow much lag
09:31:29 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Bet it's just the legacy implementation of boot password and lockscreen password, but there is no way to know unlesss you own a CopperheadOS phone.
09:31:29 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Given there was once such a feature before the separation, it is possible that they kept it and marketed and magnified it greatly for business purposes. I'll take this word and any other corporation's words with a cup of salt due to their business-driven goals in mind.
09:32:10 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <virgin_eagle[m] "Modern cameras see your screen u"> But if camera isn't even available on lock screen, how is this claim be achieved?
09:34:40 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I'm really curious on this one?
09:34:45 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Sensors API?
09:35:34 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Iirc, FLAG_SECURE is implemented on lock screen, no? To avoid screenshots or screen recording?
09:36:08 <cn3m[m]> no CCTV
09:36:16 <cn3m[m]> if it can see the correct angle
09:36:31 <cn3m[m]> there is a very low chance they could make out the numbers
09:36:46 <cn3m[m]> it is not 100% flawless
09:36:54 <cn3m[m]> almost is if you use a privacy screen
09:36:55 <cn3m[m]> but idk
09:37:11 <cn3m[m]> you need a good one
09:39:34 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Oh I see an external camera
09:39:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Both are nice solutions, not ideal
09:40:05 <virgin_eagle[m]> Yes
09:42:39 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Both are nice solutions, not 100% ideal, 2FA would be great
09:43:45 <cn3m[m]> there are much better ways to add 2fa
10:36:36 <strcat[m]> @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io: virgin_eagle: you seem quite confused - that was a past, obsolete feature of this open source project, not the new CopperheadOS
10:37:20 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <strcat[m] "@za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:pr"> Yeah, I meant that.
10:37:27 <strcat[m]> I wrote the documentation you're pasting and like most of the rest of what you're copying it from it does not apply to their fork of my legacy code
10:38:06 <strcat[m]> it's an obsolete feature and cannot + will not be reimplemented, suggest reading the past explanations of the plans for improving unlocking to replace that obsolete approach
10:38:32 <strcat[m]> I haven't seen anyone interested in working on it
10:38:38 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Yeah, I meant that, the old (open source) CopperheadOS
10:38:48 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Yeah, I meant that, the old (open source) project

10:41:31 <strcat[m]> the repositories on GitHub are the original ones
10:41:36 <strcat[m]> this is not a different project
10:41:44 <strcat[m]> same developers, same repositories
10:42:10 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Didn't meant to do that, I'll be careful with the words then.
10:44:17 <cn3m[m]> Auto Moderator will be done for the subreddit soon

10:49:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Didn't meant to do that, I'll be careful with the words then.  My apologies for the mess
10:53:50 <osmon[m]> How good is the support for the Pixel 4A? In a tweet from David Micay from June, he says it's experimental, but on the Website it's listed as stable. Can I safely buy a 4A and expect it to work similar to the 3A?
10:53:51 <osmon[m]> I'm asking this because I'm currently debating whether to buy a 3A or a 4A and I'd pick 4A mostly because of the longer device support lifespan.
10:54:38 <strcat[m]> @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io:  they left up my old blog posts + documentation and have stripped my name from it, etc. - extremely little of it applies to their fork of my work
10:54:50 <strcat[m]> osmon: there is no support for the Pixel 4a, not sure where you're seeing that
10:54:54 <strcat[m]> there is support for the Pixel 4
10:55:03 <strcat[m]> you should refer to the official site: https://grapheneos.org/
10:57:05 <osmon[m]> Obviously I can't read properly. Thanks for the fast response.
10:57:45 <strcat[m]> Pixel 4a support will likely be added in the future but it was just released and isn't supported by the mainline stable branches yet
10:57:56 <strcat[m]> it'll be in a device support branch
10:58:05 <strcat[m]> in AOSP
10:58:34 <strcat[m]> there would need to be people who step up as GrapheneOS device maintainers and implement support for it in android-prepare-vendor and GrapheneOS along with doing long-term maintenance and develop for it
10:58:41 <strcat[m]> so far no one has stepped up or started on that
10:58:52 <strcat[m]> if no one does, we just won't support it, it's certainly not a sure thing that we'll support it
10:59:07 <strcat[m]> people could have started work on it already and as far as I know no one has done that
10:59:39 <strcat[m]> for the Pixel 4, it took pretty much until the end of the device being a current generation device (8 months or so?) before people even started on support for it
11:01:19 <cn3m[m]> if anyone(who is not a mod) would like to make a post in /r/GrapheneOS and test the automod and leave feedback please do
11:03:43 <alzxjm[m]> cn3m: Should I ask if the 4a is supported?
11:04:06 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "cn3m: Should I ask if the 4a is "> whatever you want
11:04:11 <cn3m[m]> I won't approve it :)
11:06:04 <alzxjm[m]> Done.
11:06:06 <cn3m[m]> alzxjm: what do you think?
11:08:44 <alzxjm[m]> Looks good. I think a lot of questions are "Will app X work on Graphene?" so it might be good to say something about that.
11:09:06 <alzxjm[m]> I know techlore has a [project](https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/Plexus.csv) to try and address this. Dunno of Graphene is interested in it.
11:11:21 <andonl[m]> miracast support is welcome
11:14:03 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Looks good. I think a lot of que"> I can quote the Usage guide on that
11:14:04 <cn3m[m]> thanks
11:15:06 <strcat[m]> andonl: unlikely to be implemented
11:17:21 <strcat[m]> also not much point in making feature requests, we have an issue tracker largely tracking planned features and progress is very slow even on what's prioritized
11:22:03 <cn3m[m]> can someone try the updated automoderator?
11:22:25 <cn3m[m]> my posts don't get filtered and anyone on RSS will get spammed if I keep testing

11:45:51 <erhcetua[m]> he doesn't, actually he has a robot
11:57:21 <cn3m[m]> I occasionally do
11:57:26 <cn3m[m]> 🙂
11:59:23 <cn3m[m]> so true https://nitter.net/InsanityBit/status/1293878977178738692
12:20:56 <dazinism> *actually is a robot
13:11:07 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> I can not register to Signal anymore, because of missing play services. Does anyone else have this problem? I dont know if this is a Signal problem or maybe caused by a software update from Graphene. I did not had this problem in the past
13:11:49 <cdesai> where did you install Signal from?
13:12:08 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> Aurora Store
13:12:38 <strcat> do you perhaps have something weird like a fake Play Services app installed
13:12:38 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> Wich also worked in the past without problems (:
13:12:52 <strcat> look through your installed apps
13:14:58 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> Looked in the list. No, i have play services installed on a different user Profile, but this should normaly not affect the main profile (?)
13:18:17 <strcat[m]> yxcvbnmlp: I don't know how you could 'have play services installed'
13:18:23 <strcat[m]> since it's not just a regular app and won't function
13:18:42 <strcat[m]> that shouldn't be an issue unless it's the same profile though
13:20:57 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> It functions for banking. I dont know why but as you mentioned, should not be relevant for this problem (:
13:21:55 <strcat> I doubt it functions but rather just fails to work and the banking app manages to handle the errors from it not working
13:22:00 <strcat> but doesn't handle it not being there
13:22:32 <strcat> make sure it's not installed on your current profile
13:22:36 <strcat> likely the issue if it is
13:25:41 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> Its not on my current profile
13:41:06 <renlord> maybe remove it altogether and see if it works

13:46:24 <nugluglu[m]> Hello, are there any tablets that are supported by GrapheneOS so far?
13:46:50 <renlord> nugluglu[m]: no
13:48:11 <nickcalyx[m]> Wasnt a tablet once supported? Nexus 9 or something
13:50:25 <erhcetua[m]> nugluglu: https://jollyrogers.ca/public/grapheneos-channel-rules.txt >> 2. Please read the FAQ at https://grapheneos.org/faq in its entirety prior to posting.
16:09:52 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> Hello i'm interested in installing GrapheneOS, is there a way to build it for the Fairphone 3? since it's not on the device list.
16:14:00 <Knull[m]> Pixels only. The OS depends on the latest android updates to ensure security.
16:18:36 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> Okay, is there a way to Port it, the OS on Fairphone seems to be pretty much Stock Android.
16:18:44 <itriedfewhoursag> hello everyone  i tried to ask in few hours ago
16:19:51 <itriedfewhoursag> i just flashed graphene newly to pixel 4, i like it but what can i use to open my gmail email , i know it's not good but i have lot business with it and i will need to switch
16:20:05 <refragable[m]> EXM_Pumpur: Seems like it would be relatively easy if it has AOSP support https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200811#c4726432
16:20:09 <itriedfewhoursag> what app can i use for that
16:20:55 <Vicarious[m]> <itriedfewhoursag "i just flashed graphene newly to"> K-9 Mail, or FairEmail.
16:21:13 <itriedfewhoursag> tried both didn't work
16:21:38 <Vicarious[m]> 2FA?
16:21:55 <Vicarious[m]> Need to make app password.
16:22:06 <itriedfewhoursag> the k-9 kept telling wrong user name and password even it was good
16:22:13 <itriedfewhoursag> and correct
16:23:34 <Vicarious[m]> You have to generate an App Password within gmail for the email client you want. https://k9mail.app/documentation/accounts/providerSettings.html
16:24:01 <erhcetua[m]> <itriedfewhoursag "the k-9 kept telling wrong user "> check your gmail settings, you must enable "inferior security apps" or something like that
16:24:32 <itriedfewhoursag> thanks also i want to upgrade to bigger screen and already i have a friend will buy my pixel 4 , i'm considering to get pixel 3xl instead of 4 l to avoid screen flicering would this be a bad move
16:24:46 <erhcetua[m]> i may be wrong, but i had to enable this back when i used thunderbird with gmail
16:25:04 <Vicarious[m]> <itriedfewhoursag "thanks also i want to upgrade to"> You can sort the flickering out with an ADB command.
16:25:06 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> "refragable" (https://matrix.to/#/@refragable:privacytools.io): There's a ROM from /e/ for Fairphone 3, if i'm mistaken is based of AOSP

16:25:44 <Vicarious[m]> "itriedfewhoursag" (https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_itriedfewhoursag:matrix.org) you will need to do two commands.
16:25:52 <Vicarious[m]> adb shell settings put system peak_refresh_rate 60
16:25:56 <Vicarious[m]> adb shell settings put system min_refresh_rate 60
16:26:25 <Vicarious[m]> While messing around with adb isn't recommended, this setting is fine.
16:27:59 <itriedfewhoursag> i never used adb before
16:28:30 <itriedfewhoursag> i'm very very very beginner
16:29:58 <Vicarious[m]> That's okay. We all have to start somewhere :)
16:30:19 <itriedfewhoursag> i like the way this going :D
16:30:20 <itriedfewhoursag> :D
16:30:29 <itriedfewhoursag> 4 xl it is
16:31:53 <Vicarious[m]> If you want more help about the screen flickering, send me a private message as we don't want to clog up this room. Also, 4 XL is great... And not all devices have flickering - it is potluck.
16:33:23 <itriedfewhoursag> will do as soon as i get the new phone
16:35:38 <retry0x[m]> Grapheneos is susceptible to sepc exec attacks correct?
16:36:26 <itriedfewhoursag> i hope our amazing developers add this feature in the future as an option for beginners like me
16:37:35 <retry0x[m]> Is grapheneos suceptable to specexec attacks?

17:21:48 <Make42> Hi, I have read that Pixel has a pretty great camera and that this is largely due to the Googles great camera software. Is this software replaced when installing Graphene OS?
17:27:01 <Vicarious[m]> <Make42 "Hi, I have read that Pixel has a"> GCam isn't supported officially, but it can be installed. However, there's still a possibility that Daniel is going to remove the SELinux domain that uses the Pixel Visual Core, which would mean that the photos won't be as good. Using Open Camera with the Camera2 API works well out of the box, but the quality isn't the same as GCam.
17:27:08 <Wonderfall[m]> Google Camera is not supported by Graphene. It might still work but is not guaranteed to in the future.
17:27:08 <Wonderfall[m]> An alternative would be OpenCamera.
17:28:15 <erhcetua[m]> i wonder if it has any impact regarding security/privacy ?
17:28:31 <Make42> Wonderfall[m] I do not understand. If I install, will I not be able to use the camera of the pixel?
17:28:34 <Vicarious[m]> To get GCam working, you will need to download the apk from here https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider to fake the APIs required for GCam.
17:28:47 <Make42> What is a "Google Camera" or GCam?
17:29:06 <Vicarious[m]> Google Camera is GCam.
17:29:21 <Make42> Ok and is that a software or is that the hardware camera?
17:29:26 <Wonderfall[m]> Yes I was talking about Gcam, camera itself works fine on Graphene.
17:30:05 <Vicarious[m]> <Make42 "Ok and is that a software or is "> Software makes use of the hardware.
17:30:33 <Make42> Ok, I thought, that the camera of the Pixel is great due to some kind of software - I did not expect this to be an App (which sounds more like photoshop or something like that - more like an afterthought, not the control mechanism of the hardware).
17:30:51 <Vicarious[m]> GCam (aka Google Camera) has some proprietary processing algorithms built in, which makes the photos look much nicer.
17:31:17 <Make42> Vicarious[m] But if it is just and apk, I could install it on other phones as well, right?
17:31:39 <Make42> I mean, if it is just an app.
17:31:46 <Vicarious[m]> Yes, you can. There are also custom builds for other phones.
17:32:29 <Wonderfall[m]> Google Camera largely makes what the Pixel camera is so great about, thanks to powerful algorithms. Open Camera doesn't come close for a "point & shoot" experience. If you're going to use Graphene, keep in mind Google Camera may not work later. If you're okay with that, that's fine.
17:32:31 <Vicarious[m]> But the hardware is still required to get the best photos.
17:33:17 <Make42> So... in what way is the Pixel having a great camera then... if it is just the GCam... any camera could be great?
17:33:38 <Make42> Vicarious[m]: What do you mean? That the hardware is still great?
17:34:18 <Make42> Or is GCam not properly working on other phones as good as it does with a Pixel?
17:34:25 <Vicarious[m]> <Make42 "Vicarious: What do you mean? Tha"> Yes. The hardware is still good.
17:34:34 <Wonderfall[m]> The sensor itself is not bad at all, it's just software is equally important to hardware nowadays (the same applies to DSLR in fact).
17:35:34 <Wonderfall[m]> With a fair bit of experience, Open Camera can be just fine for the average user.
17:35:39 <Make42> Wonderfall[m]: What I mean is this: Apprently the Note 9 has stronger hardware (camera). If I would put the GCam on the Note 9, then wouldn't I get the best experience overall?
17:35:56 <Vicarious[m]> You got hardware and software. Hardware being the phone and the Pixel Visual Core, along with other sensors. Then you have software, which is GCam which has Google's proprietary processing algorithms built in. Google have allowed other apps to "tap" into this Pixel Visual Core via the Camera2 API, to get better photos, but they're still not as good as using GCam.
17:37:44 <Wonderfall[m]> <Make42 "Wonderfall: What I mean is this:"> Google Camera is designed for Pixel so other phones might not benefit from, let's say, optical corrections.

17:38:47 <Make42> there's still a possibility that Daniel is going to remove the SELinux domain that uses the Pixel Visual Core, which would mean that the photos won't be as good.
17:38:52 <Make42> What does this mean?
17:38:58 <Make42> What is SELinux?
17:39:35 <Make42> Is GCam controling the aperature and stuff like that?
17:39:51 <Vicarious[m]> Security-enhanced Linux kernel
17:40:10 <Make42> Or is GCam doing some post processing - sort of like an automated photoshop?
17:41:22 <Make42> Vicarious[m]: I don't see any APK at  https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
17:41:32 <Vicarious[m]> For sake of argument, yes, it's like an automated Photoshop

18:33:57 <Make42> I read that /e/ is also a privacy oriented OS. How does it compare to Graphene OS?
18:37:23 <Vicarious[m]> It may be "private", as in companies aren't snooping in on you (apart from /e/), but there's no security.
18:40:56 <Make42> what is the difference?
18:41:26 <Make42> private = making sure that companies don't snoop, secure = making sure that hackers don't snoop ?
18:42:39 <insep_> <insep_ "ewwlo.xyz might be better source"> site seems to be down, https://ewwlo.void.partidopirata.com.ar/ is still up
18:42:56 <cn3m[m]> insep: a lot of that is bullshit to be fair
18:43:03 <cn3m[m]> the main concerns are the security
18:43:07 <cn3m[m]> Lineage has AWFUL security
18:43:18 <cn3m[m]> but /e/ throws out their requirements
18:46:07 <Make42> cn3m[m]: "but /e/ throws out their requirements" what does it mean? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

18:55:52 <itriedfewhoursag> thanks so much guys
18:55:58 <cn3m[m]> due to undeniable security concerns and ancient Android
18:56:00 <cn3m[m]> /e/ keeps it
18:58:21 <alex-resist> So /e/ is even more negligent than LineageOS?
18:59:01 <anupritaisno1[m]>  /e/ is one of the worst roms you could get
18:59:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> See ewwlo.xyz
18:59:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> They're basically as bad as copperheadOS
18:59:55 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey, when I try to use the get info (after selecting a file and the 3 dots)in the file explorer the app crash ? Idk if it's only Graphene or AOSP
19:00:35 <Make42> Well, if /e/ supports phones that nowbody else wants to support that means that those phones can be in use longer - at least from an environmental point of view I think this is a plus.
19:00:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
19:01:31 <cn3m[m]> <Make42 "Well, if /e/ supports phones tha"> No they essentially mirror unsafe builds from Lineage they destroy
19:01:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lineageos actually does security patches for each android version for about 6 years
19:01:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> They only build updates for the latest version
19:01:59 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> 😁 Guess i shouldn't have mentioned /e/
19:02:22 <anupritaisno1[m]>  /e/ just exploits the fact that somebody at lineage does security patches
19:02:58 <Make42> What license is Lineage OS?
19:03:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll find security patches for versions as old as 4.4 on lineageos
19:03:17 <cn3m[m]> Lineage is to GrapheneOS security wise what /e/ is to Lineage
19:04:04 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> guess ill try building Graphene for Fairphone and look how well that works out.
19:04:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> It won't boot fyi
19:04:27 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> I never knew /e/ is that bad
19:04:30 <cn3m[m]> <EXM_Pumpur[m] "guess ill try building Graphene "> Fairphone requires a bootloader exploit for verified boot
19:04:38 <alex-resist> Interesting to see that LienageOS is not considered rock bottom. LineageOS gets so much Flak on this channel
19:04:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: bold of you to assume it will boot
19:05:04 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "It won't boot fyi"> 🙂 Is there a way to make it Boot?
19:05:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> alex-resist: no mostly just from cn3m

19:05:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> <cn3m[m] "it is rock bottom"> See glassrom
19:05:42 <cn3m[m]> /e/ is old dead Lineage reliving

19:06:36 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> 😆 Im not afraid of breaking stuff if it works afterwards
19:06:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lineage ain't the rock bottom tbh
19:07:14 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> Is it a firmware issue?
19:07:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll tell you what's really rock bottom
19:07:22 <cn3m[m]> Linux Phones
19:08:10 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> <cn3m[m] "Linux Phones"> That hurts
19:08:33 <EXM_Pumpur[m]> I thought gnu hurd is rock bottom

19:10:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lineageos doesn't even compare to the shit these do
19:10:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> They can't even be called ROMs
19:10:42 <cn3m[m]> that is true
19:10:49 <erhcetua[m]> you forgot frankenROM and AEX

19:17:40 <cn3m[m]> <Make42 "cn3m: So why not just buy a Pixe"> no Google with Rattlesnake OS and you control the keys
19:17:48 <cn3m[m]> which you could do with GrapheneOS too btw
19:18:05 <Make42> https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack#prerequisites ... riiiight...
19:18:36 <Make42> So it takes only a couple of tens of hours to get it setup... cool...
19:19:54 <Make42> I am sure the tec is nice, but so is my research AI code - just that nobody can use it except me...
19:21:29 <refragable[m]> The awsome part of RattlesnakeOS is how easy it is to make custom builds in the cloud on an automatic schedule with signed OTA updates and attestation. This is good for someone who doesn't have a local computer to make builds with. Regardless, this is getting off topic.
19:24:44 <Make42> refragable[m]: 99,9% of the people just want a phone that works plus some values (security, quality, fairness - depending on the person) - but if you need a specialized education in mobile and cloud development just to get the OS on the phone... well. That is a problem.
19:27:08 <refragable[m]> Make42: There are good instructions to get any of RattlesnakeOS, GrapheneOS, or CalyxOS. You don't need any special skills to get them working. Just patience and the ability to follow instructions.
19:27:46 <Make42> refragable[m]: I need AWS for RattlesnakeOS...
19:29:19 <refragable[m]> Make42:  You can use it with any AWS compatible cloud provider which is an advanced topic, the default instructions are just for AWS. This is not the place to ask for help getting RattlesnakeOS builds running.
19:30:38 <Make42> Is graphene OS a custom ROM ?
19:31:12 <Make42> I am asking because cn3m[m] said he has never been into custom ROMs, yet he is here...
19:31:41 <Vicarious[m]> https://grapheneos.org/
19:31:46 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe thats a terminology thing
19:32:09 <Make42> ?
19:32:15 <alex-resist> To me, "custom ROM" sounds like something from the car tuning scene. An OS to show off.
19:32:47 <cn3m[m]> <Make42 "I am asking because cn3m said he"> historically I haven't been into the scene
19:32:49 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe he doesn't consider it a custom Rom, but instead an OS
19:33:30 <thematten[m]> Well, I guess it is a custom ROM after all, just with slightly different goals than most of the others
19:33:31 <nickcalyx[m]> Ubuntu is forked from Debian but its considered a whole other OS
19:33:32 <Make42> never heard it like that, don't know anyone who has a custom ROM, or would show it off - only know people who would not know what it is
19:34:22 <Make42> (outside the internet that is of course)
19:35:21 <cn3m[m]> I don't like the term Custom ROM in general
19:35:26 <cn3m[m]> it is not a ROM
19:35:30 <cn3m[m]> it is not read only memory
19:35:34 <Make42> :-D
19:35:37 <nickcalyx[m]> <cn3m[m] "I don't like the term Custom ROM"> See, terminology
19:35:42 <Make42> yeah, I see THAT point
19:36:05 <cn3m[m]> No, my whole point is I haven't been involved with the scene
19:36:06 <Make42> but a car is also not "wheels" and some people say "nice wheels"
19:36:22 <cn3m[m]> I used to be a jailbreaker, but my last Android was locked
19:36:22 <Make42> cn3m[m]: So why are you HERE?
19:37:33 <alex-resist> Techically, this IRC channel is also part of the scene. But as I said, I would differentiate between reasonable OSes and show-off custom ROMs that don't care about privacy or security
19:37:44 <cn3m[m]> <Make42 "cn3m: So why are you HERE?"> since I like GrapheneOS
19:37:46 <cn3m[m]> I use it
19:37:56 <cn3m[m]> I don't have history on the custom ROM scene
19:38:04 <cdesai> F-Droid.apk should be the latest 1.9 now, see https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroid-website/-/merge_requests/571
19:38:07 <cn3m[m]> I just don't know much outside of the big ones
19:38:18 <Make42> I mean: You seem to be a moderator. I am also not into custom ROMs or anything. I don't even want anything to do with the phone really, except that it works. I am here, because I want some privacy from Google etc. That is why I use linux on my laptop.
19:38:20 <nickcalyx[m]> it seems like most 'custom ROMs' are only about design/aesthetics, not substance
19:38:26 <cdesai> so all the folks trying to use it in a different user won't have the issue. cn3m[m]
19:38:47 <thematten[m]> Deciding whether GrapheneOS is a separate OS or custom Andoroid ROM sounds a lot like a "ship of Theseus" paradox
19:39:03 <cdesai> another big thing is just being able to run the latest android version on your older device / something that the manufacturer doesn't update in time or at all
19:39:09 <cdesai> that's how I got into this "scene"
19:40:47 <Vicarious[m]> HTC Desire in 2010 using Oxygen custom ROM was my gateway to this world.
19:41:12 <Vicarious[m]> Don't think I've had stock on any phone since then.
19:41:24 <Make42> Is there ANY website of GlassROM except the repos on github?
