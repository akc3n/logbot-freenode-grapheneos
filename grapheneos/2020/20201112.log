00:09:09 <grayhatter> I was told graphene was looking for extra developer hours; I may have a few cycles where should I start looking?
00:10:22 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: look through https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues, see what might be a good fit for you to work on
00:10:28 <strcat[m]> grayhatter: and look through https://grapheneos.org/build
00:10:41 <strcat[m]> which covers building the OS, Vanadium and other things tied to development
00:21:29 <habbihabbiya3[m]> how difficult is it to become a maintainer for pixel 5, I am not a tech savy and have very limited skills?
00:24:54 <TheJollyRoger> habbihabbiya3[m]: It requires some programming skills, familiarity with the internals of the android ecosystem, and more importantly, a commitment for the lifetime of the device. Typically, that's three years because that's how long the devices recieve firmware updates for.
00:27:30 <habbihabbiya3[m]> man i dont think im that technically inclined I will try my best to support financially when I use grapheneos for the pixel 5. thank you.
00:27:47 <louipcm> how much time? 20 hrs per month or more?
00:30:28 <TheJollyRoger> yarr, donations indeed also help us a lot!
00:30:52 <TheJollyRoger> louipcm: I'm actually not sure. I'm not a maintainer, sorry. :(
00:31:15 <louipcm> noprob
01:18:13 <asdf123abd[m]> I'll be donating to the project soon, thanks so much devs!
01:19:04 <TheJollyRoger> asdf123abd[m]: awesome, thanks for the support!
01:50:50 <sst_76> I apologise if this has been brought up, but is anyone else having issues with aurora or yalp?
02:17:42 <Beard> I'm still fairly new with this so bear with me.I just put the most recent update of GrapheneOS on a new Pixel 4a and transferred my SIM card over. I just got the cellular calling to work but no data. I'm trying to find out how to view/change the APN settings to see if that's the problem but the menu isn't pulling it up.Settings>Network &
02:17:43 <Beard> Internet>Mobile Network>Advanced>Carrier SettingsAm I just stupid or is something wrong? If anyone has guidance I would appreciate it. Thank you!
02:18:12 <sst_76> Are you on sprint?
02:18:18 <Beard> Yep
02:18:31 <sst_76> Bad news
02:18:36 <sst_76> Sprint is 3g only
02:19:01 <Beard> Ok, is there a better provider I can switch to?
02:19:06 <sst_76> (for graphene). I know because I just switched off of sprint as a 12yr customer.
02:19:29 <Beard> I don't have a contract right now so I'm ready to get away from them.
02:19:38 <sst_76> I switched to Mint mobile which uses tmobile towers and it's a huge improvement.
02:19:54 <Beard> That's what I was looking at too lmao
02:19:57 <Beard> Sweet tho
02:20:47 <Beard> So would the sprint SIM card be blocking it from opening the APN options?
02:21:22 <louipc> aurora site is down btw
02:21:40 <louipc> you can use custom tokenizer: http://www.auroraoss.in:8080
02:22:33 <sst_76> Beard, I wish I could remember the technical details. I had an eSim which...did not play well. I don't know how much different an actual Sim would be.
02:23:28 <sst_76> Thanks louipc I was wondering, since yalp also was having issues, if maybe the Google store changed something on their end
02:24:35 <Beard> I just figured it out. I just switched the "Preferred Network Type" to 3G and it started working. But I'll try out Mint and see how it goes. Thanks sst_76
02:25:20 <Masterkeibo> Hi, would the Graphene Team consider adding icon pack support in graphene launcher?
02:54:48 <cryptag[m]> Is aurora store not working today?
03:14:26 <louipcm> its busted today

05:04:51 <Free99> Hi everyone. I've just bought a Pixel 3, which was unfortunately updated to almost the latest Android 11. Now I see TWRP doesn't work, etc.
05:05:22 <Free99> I can't find a point to start on with getting graphene onto this device. Can anyone share a link/guide? Thank you
05:06:15 <TheJollyRoger> Hi adeus[m], huh, would you be able to file a bug, please? Might be something to keep track of.
05:06:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Free99, TWRP won't be needed. You'll just need to follow the instructions on grapheneos.org at https://grapheneos.org/install
05:06:53 <TheJollyRoger> You will only need the official fastboot and platform tools from Google.
05:07:50 <Free99> Thanks TheJollyRoger! As a quick follow-up, would you know if getting MicroG running on graphene to be difficult?
05:08:57 <TheJollyRoger> The majority of problems that people run into here are that they use shady third-party fastboot versions, use outdated versions of platform tools or fastboot, or try to "get clever" and use their own super special homebrewed setup, and that's what causes problems. Outside of that, the installer script takes care of everything, it's a production quality release. No userdebug builds, no
05:08:59 <TheJollyRoger> sideloading, etc.
05:09:30 <TheJollyRoger> Hey anytime. With respect to MicroG, I haven't tried it before.
05:10:04 <Free99> Got it, thanks again :)
05:10:15 <Free99> I'll let you know if it works
05:10:24 <Free99> (microG I mean haha)
05:10:29 <TheJollyRoger> Awesome.
05:11:16 <TheJollyRoger> It may, or it may not - I know that GrapheneOS does make some of the SELinux mandatory access controls more restrictive than normal to mitigate exploits.
05:12:00 <TheJollyRoger> I'm not really familiar with MicroG at all so I do appreciate knowing if it will or won't!
05:17:54 <louipc> twrp is old hat
05:18:27 <Free99> louipc, only constant in life seems to be change ;)
05:18:45 <louipc> and taxes
05:18:49 <Free99> what replaces it?

10:28:16 <r_e[m]> Hello everyone. I am trying to run a banking app and that works without gsf (have it up and running on a lineage is device) but does not work on graphene. Where is the best place to ask about it/open an issue - github?
10:35:01 <jpds> r_e[m]: Probably best to talk to your bank about it
10:36:47 <r_e[m]> I doubt anyone I talk to at the bank will understand what I mean.
10:38:33 <jpds> I assume your lineage phone has microg on it?
10:39:19 <r_e[m]> Nope
10:40:12 <jpds> No idea then, but it's not on graphene to make your banking app work
10:40:27 <jpds> Finance apps are the worst
10:41:25 <r_e[m]> I know it is not their responsibility, but that is not what I am asking.
10:42:02 <jpds> You're asking where to open an issue, and the answer is: your bank
10:42:55 <r_e[m]> I think it is fair to request looking into app compatibility. If the answer is no, that is fine, but I'll know after opening a question in the right place.
10:43:18 <r_e[m]> Maybe I forgot something, maybe it is a setting. Don't know right now.
10:48:13 <nscnt> r_e[m]: Take a look at rule 2 A) at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louipc/grapheneos.org/irc/static/irc-rules.txt
10:49:26 <r_e[m]> Thanks
10:50:53 <nscnt> If developers do not develop apps that are compatible with AOSP, that's on their part and not on GrapheneOS's.
10:54:12 <r_e[m]> That's fair enough of course, but you are missing what my question is:
10:54:12 <r_e[m]> How can I find out if this is an app compatibility issue, or whether I mucked something up, or whether there is something wrong with my install.
10:54:49 <r_e[m]> If it is incompatible, then is there a potential workaround.
11:09:38 <nscnt> r_e[m]: By solving the problem strategically. What error do you have? What could be the reason for it? Does it work on stock Android? If you want to keep the conversation going, I would ask you to move over to #grapheneos-offtopic
11:11:34 <r_e[m]> Thank you
11:25:53 <pablomh[m]> hello, everyone
11:26:31 <nscnt> pablomh[m]: Hello
11:27:05 <pablomh[m]> is anyone that you know of that is trying to por GrapheneOS to Sony devices?
11:28:24 <nscnt> Never heard of anyone, no.
11:28:47 <pablomh[m]> thx
11:56:48 <andrewmartini[m]> pablomh: wont happen
12:04:53 <pablomh[m]> 457tygfghhfg: why? I'm not looking for an official release, of course
12:47:30 <tobzn[m]> Hey guys, do you see any way to create a whole grapheneos backup image?
13:47:29 <jpds> tobzn[m]: seedvault is the supported backup method
13:57:00 <nscnt> tobzn[m]: I don't think there is a way due to how AOSP handles storage. Seedvault is probably the best backup method, as mentioned by jpds
16:19:20 <renex> Is there some write-up what one should think about when choosing screen unlock method?
16:31:26 <louipc> I don't see any. Interesting people are proposing double pattern unlock since single pattern is not secure
16:35:30 <renex> I was thinking about using face + pattern, but can one set an antipattern that when entered would lock the phone so that a special password is needed to unlock?
16:43:56 <louipc> nope
17:00:35 <strcat[m]> renex: use a strong passphrase + biometric unlock for convenience and then you can reboot (or use lockdown mode) in a situation where you want it at rest
17:01:07 <strcat[m]> or just use a random PIN (8 digit or so) without biometric unlock if you want to rely on the Titan M for security instead of your passphrase
17:01:14 <strcat[m]> use profiles to divide things up
17:01:28 <strcat[m]> you can have a profile with only a strong passphrase that's less convenient, etc.
17:01:51 <strcat[m]> pattern unlock is terrible
17:13:05 <zfnmxt> Has anyone had any luck getting GCam running on a 4a via (or something like) Gcam Services Provider?
17:28:25 <philip> zfnmxt: Yes, people are successful, see https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider (at least GCam 7.4 & 7.5 seem to work)
17:29:36 <zfnmxt[m]> philip: Is it safe to get the relevant `.apk`s from a site like `apkmirror.com`?
17:30:24 <zfnmxt[m]> (Or is there a better way to acquire them?)
17:32:55 <philip> zfnmxt[m]: Not sure, can't you install it from Aurora Store?
17:33:55 <zfnmxt[m]> Doesn't appear for me. Spoofing as a PIxel or Pixel 2 didn't work either.
17:35:36 <zfnmxt[m]> Oh, huh. I actually just tried again and the Pixel 2 spoof worked.
17:37:37 <zfnmxt[m]> But the version is `4.4.x` :C
17:45:10 <zfnmxt[m]> Well, I risked just getting `7.4` from apkmirror.com and disabled the network permission. It works. :)
18:05:11 <yoda__1> Hi all, I am using the last GOS build on a pixel 3a. Am I the only one having problem accessing Aurora Store ?  May be it's a problem on their side and nothing to do with GOS ?
18:06:00 <louipcm> yea you should use the custom tokenizer in network settings
18:06:17 <louipcm> their main domain is down
18:06:39 <yoda__1> tks !
18:07:31 <yoda__1> WOW  it's now working louipcm  ! tks
18:17:51 <fotojunkie[m]> Hi Guys, i'm just thinking about installing GrapheneOS on a Pixel4, but was wondering if dual SIM Support is given under GrapheneOS?
18:18:43 <jpds> fotojunkie[m]: The second SIM is an eSIM which isn't supported under grapheneos
18:21:09 <fotojunkie[m]> <jpds "fotojunkie: The second SIM is an"> Too bad. If it would be a great experience it should have support for eSIM as dual SIM functionality to become a daily driver.
18:22:44 <jpds> fotojunkie[m]: As I understand it, google uses proprietary applications for the eSIM setup stuff
18:26:07 <fotojunkie[m]> <jpds "fotojunkie: As I understand it, "> That would explain the missing feature. Unfortunatly i use one SIM as Private and a second for business cases. So i don't want to carry two phones with me.

18:38:48 <cryptag[m]> * Are there any compatible app lists out there?
18:52:29 <nscnt> Pixel 3a. Fully charged the phone. 8 hours later my phone is at 3 % without even touching it. No apps used unexpectedly much battery (well, nearly no usage at all). Has never happened before. Just writing here for the record.
18:56:22 <nscnt> Still very curious how that could have happened
18:59:18 <jpds> I've also noticed that my 3a has been discharging quicker than normal in the last month
19:00:08 <nscnt> I have heavily used the phone in the past and it would have never died that quick
19:00:18 <nscnt> "heavily"
19:02:20 <nscnt> I'll reboot later. Idk if something got messed up
19:29:53 <broda721[m]> is there a built-in application that tracks screen-time?
19:30:00 <broda721[m]> or setting
19:30:30 <broda721[m]> just found that there's an permission that 'tracks app usage and how much time is spent' etc
19:32:05 <yoda__1> Noobie question. Have been using GOS for 6 month and more on my Pixel 3A and love it, but some important apps to me ( Tesla, Yamaha MyRide) do not work well under GOS. SO my noobie question : how to I go back to STOCK android that came with the pixel ? (I'me getting good at GOS install, SideLoading etc but going back to Android, I never did...) I'M sad as I loved GOS...

19:37:09 <yoda__1> mrxx_0[m],  as for the stock os image for pixel 3A, I google it and if it's from google, I'm ok? LOL
19:37:35 <strcat[m]> broda721: no, but there's built-in support for doing it
19:37:43 <strcat[m]> you can grant it as a special permission

20:39:15 <arept> hello guys
20:42:23 <arept> I bought a 4a like a month ago and just used it with android bc graphene wasnt out yet. Just checked the website and saw that there is a release. This phone is my main phone so the os needs to be stable. Do you think its stable enough yet or should i wait for a bit?
20:50:01 <TheJollyRoger> Hi arept, if by stable you mean production quality, at the moment I should stress that if they're releases, they're production quality releases, with full factory images and full verified boot keying. They're tested, they aren't "userdebug" builds.
20:50:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> arept I'm the one who did the 4a bringup and got it tested, everything works fine
20:51:11 <TheJollyRoger> I say give it a shot, I've been using GrapheneOS since, and it's stable and feature rich enough to be used as a daily driver.
20:51:43 <TheJollyRoger> Just that at this moment, we don't have a first-party application store of curated apps, so either you have to find your apps yourself or find a third-party application store.
20:52:43 <TheJollyRoger> So if that's OK with you, and you feel you would appreciate the extra security and privacy features of GrapheneOS, then GrapheneOS is for you.
20:53:46 <Lnsi[m]> Hey, I am close to the decision to install Grapheneos on my pixel 4. One question before I do that: does Face scan work without any trouble, especially to log into apps?
20:54:42 <TheJollyRoger> Hi Lnsi[m], face unlock is tested on the Pixel 4 and working.
20:55:09 <arept> TheJollyRoger: im already using fdroid and no google apps at all ill be fine thx
20:55:10 <TheJollyRoger> As for logging into apps, I haven't tried that, since I didn't have any apps that supported it.
20:55:15 <TheJollyRoger> arept: great!
20:55:26 <arept> anupritaisno1[m]: Nice!
20:56:17 <Lnsi[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi Lónsi, face unlock is tested "> Thanks for the quick response!
21:01:22 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
21:19:59 <AppAraat[m]> yo, anyone here having trouble with latest build 692 ([universal debug fdroid](https://buildkite.com/matrix-dot-org/element-android/builds/latest?branch=develop&state=passed)) of Element Android? It's not starting up here.
21:27:34 <belay_that_order> hi all. i cannot unlock my bootloader. tried many different things, and came down to the conclusion that my usb port on the device is non functional when entering the bootloader mode. possible?
21:28:02 <louipcm> or cable

23:02:17 <lev[m]> though I guess it could be any military sci-fi, or plain military for that matter
23:02:55 <belay_that_order> no, it's star trek TNG which i was watching while creating a profile on element in order to moan about my phone

23:04:29 <belay_that_order> <anupritaisno1[m] "belay_that_order pm me "> PMed in a separate room
23:13:32 <M473857a[m]> My remote attestation failed repeatedly - i disabled an reenabled it and now the verified Boot hash changed. Does that mean that my device is compromised or are there other possible explanations? Thanks for all answers
23:15:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> 473857a yes, there is an issue
23:15:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should never disable and enable attestation like that
23:17:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Verified boot hash doesn't matter
23:18:16 <M473857a[m]> Well I only disabled it because it failed and would not work anymore
23:18:45 <M473857a[m]> So either there is another explanation or my device is compromised
23:19:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why did the attestation fail
23:22:24 <M473857a[m]> There were no error messages. Both only service and auditor app aren't very verbose. I just got the error message that my device failed to validate itself. I sometimes had that when I didn't have access to Internet for a while but now it didn't reverify itself even after a few days.
23:22:37 <M473857a[m]> *online service
23:29:47 <Dylanger[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Verified boot hash doesn't matte"> Lol the Verified Boot hash 💯 matters
23:30:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
