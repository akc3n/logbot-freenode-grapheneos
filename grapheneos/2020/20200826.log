00:03:15 <andresbs[m]> Oh yeah I caught it, I was just throwing a fact in hehe
00:04:19 <andresbs[m]> Someone once asked me if I can root his phone to hack Whatsapp
00:04:19 <andresbs[m]> Yikes
00:04:45 <andresbs[m]> I wonder if people still fall for those scams, children aside
00:06:20 <derpy> tnx for the corrections strcat[m]
00:12:45 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "I was only kidding, at the reaso"> the calyxOS squares were such a system shock I almost rooted /s
00:20:42 <aeonsolution[m]> faxing: im still looking at the voicemail stuff, ill keep you posted
00:24:22 <faxing[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "faxing: im still looking at the "> Thank you so much
00:54:54 <aeonsolution[m]> blacktwig: the notifications issue with signal is off topic, try looking at https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318711-Troubleshooting-Notifications or https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+notification; i do remember someone mentioning a fix in past but i couldnt find it in the logs
00:54:56 <aeonsolution[m]> gl
01:02:22 <anonymous821[m]> Hi all, I find that I am unable to receive message alerts until my phone is unlocked.
01:02:22 <anonymous821[m]> Also, the alarm clock occasionally does not ring until the phone is unlocked.
01:02:22 <anonymous821[m]> Is there a setting I may not know of which needs to be activated?
01:03:17 <alzxjm[m]> anonymous821: Settings > Display > Lock screen display
01:03:20 <alzxjm[m]> Do you have "Don't show notifications at all"
01:03:29 <alzxjm[m]> ?
01:06:04 <anonymous821[m]> ahh, I think I found it. There should be three options to choose from yea?
01:06:34 <anonymous821[m]> it is currently set to show sensitive content only when unlocked
01:06:44 <anonymous821[m]> thx, i will make the changes
01:22:09 <spoonhoarder82[m> <nikitalita[m]1 "but yeah, if it's persisting, yo"> How to switch to 60hz mode?  I don't see a setting?
01:24:46 <nikitalita[m]1> hmmm
01:26:24 <spoonhoarder82[m> Also wanted to chime in about the p4xl camera lag: I get it too, but it is usually only at high DPI.  Low DPI seems fine.  This wax the cade on lineageOS too, so I'm guessing it has something to do with the stock asop cam.
01:26:45 <nikitalita[m]1> oh, weird; smooth display doesn't seem to be toggleable on the newest version
01:28:44 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, the force 90hz option in developer options isn't there either
01:32:21 <spoonhoarder82[m> Well if anyone knows how to help get rid of the flickering with those settings via ADB, or if they will be including again in an upcoming build that would be great
01:34:18 <nikitalita[m]1> spoonhoarder82:  I'm not sure if grapheneos actually had these options in the first place; I think people were doing this with turning on battery saver or setting it with adb
01:34:51 <Newbie> Is this the place to ask for help/tech support? My new PIxel 3a Graphene install, the camera app seems to capture well after the flash, so photos are not illuminated. Anybody else see this issue? A search online doesn't show much for results
01:35:19 <spoonhoarder82[m> Interesting, so if I turn in battery saver it should go away?
01:36:30 <nikitalita[m]1> I'd give it a shot
01:38:36 <Newbie> I may have found an answer. I'll try Open Camera app
01:40:29 <spoonhoarder82[m> OK, you were 100% right, battery save means no more flicker.  So I am assuming that it means I should I should set 60fps only via adb.  Or maybe 90fps only if the battery hit isn't too bad (and data on that would be good to know)?
01:42:18 <nikitalita[m]1> I don't know; when looking in the logs someone said that this may necessitate a reset of user data if you do that, but it's not clear
01:43:13 <nikitalita[m]1> which is not ideal if you're already using the phone and have your data loaded on it
01:52:51 <spoonhoarder82[m> Yeah that would suck for sure.
01:54:10 <spoonhoarder82[m> I guess I'll have to make that choice.  Does battery savwr mean no notifications from signal?  I could just leave battery saver on if there are no big down sides there.
01:56:22 <nikitalita[m]1> In the logs, people have been reporting they they've been able to get notifications from foss apps using battery saver, so it should be alright
01:56:22 <nikitalita[m]1> you may want to test
02:00:58 <blueuser[m]> Last time i checked it was also throttling cpu clock speed
02:01:06 <spoonhoarder82[m> Yeah, looks like signal works, but calendar does not.  Decisions decisions!
02:01:18 <spoonhoarder82[m> Interesting, how would I test that?
02:04:42 <nikitalita[m]1> yeah, and battery saver doesn't appear to have granular options for that either
02:05:35 <nikitalita[m]1> You could have someone message you while the phone is asleep, but that wouldn't test calendar
02:05:40 <nikitalita[m]1> hmmm
02:09:08 <spoonhoarder82[m> Just read this, supposedly in the latest update two weeks ago on stock for P4 it should have been fixed? https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/hny41q/pixel_4_flicker_issue_fixed_internally_says_dave/
02:09:08 <spoonhoarder82[m> Has that been applied to GOS yet?
02:09:08 <spoonhoarder82[m> Also top comment has interesting solution, but unsure if it works for GOS?
02:09:56 <blueuser[m]> it's an android 11 issue i believe
02:10:07 <nikitalita[m]1> I dunno if that's actually been pushed yet
02:10:48 <nikitalita[m]1> spoonhoarder82: If you want, you can try the solution in the top post and report back, then we'd know
02:11:23 <spoonhoarder82[m> Haha, I'll have to do some backup up first, but I might.  Flickering driving me nuts at night
02:35:09 <spoonhoarder82[m> <Vicarious[m] "Right, enable USB Debugging"> Hi Vicarious, I want to use these instructions to try to fix screen flickering on my p4xl.  You say it will wipe user data, but I'm not sure if you are referring to these adb steps or the install pulse35 was talking about.  Can you (or anyone else) clarify if doing adb shell to set screen to 60hz will wipe user data?  Thanks!
02:48:31 <strcat[m]> anonymous821: you need to do an initial unlock after reboot to do the initial decryption and then stuff will work when locked - only a few rare things can work before decryption since user data isn't available unless the app went through the process of creating 'device encrypted' data and explicitly using it, along with making anything that needs to run before decryption of user data 'direct boot' aware which is very
02:48:31 <strcat[m]> explicit and per-activity/per-service
02:49:02 <strcat[m]> for example our Updater app is Direct Boot aware and uses device encryption storage, so that you can apply an over-the-air update without needing to decrypt
02:49:11 <strcat[m]> for example if you want to update but you're somewhere you don't want to unlock your phone
02:49:32 <strcat[m]> and if it's a security update + you're somewhere you don't want to unlock your phone there's a good chance you do want to update ASAP
02:50:12 <strcat[m]> you can't expect much to work before the initial unlock though - very, very few apps go out of the way to be direct boot aware and use device encrypted storage, it's a pain to do it, which is a good thing
02:51:21 <strcat[m]> there are 3 levels of encryption offered: normal (decrypted after initial unlock), device encrypted (requires explicitly making the data that way, and having direct boot aware activities/services to use) and then keystore encrypted (which can be kept at rest when the device is locked after the initial unlock, if the key is configured to only be available when unlocked)
02:52:00 <strcat[m]> if apps don't do anything special, i.e. 99.9% of apps, their data is protected by the key generated with the initial unlock
02:52:36 <strcat[m]> they have to go out of the way to either make it available pre-initial-unlock or to make it unavailable to the OS while locked post-initial-unlock
02:52:42 <strcat[m]> (all data is always encrypted on storage ofc)

06:36:41 <Biruwa> Hello, what is the function of Settings > Accounts in GrapheneOS?
06:37:15 <Biruwa> In Settings > Accounts, there lists a section titled "Accounts for Owner", and it currently has Signal Messanger as one of my accounts.
06:37:28 <Biruwa> Going down, there is an Add account button, and a Automatically sync data toggle.
06:37:55 <Biruwa> When I click Add account, the interface does not appear to work. Clicking on it results in a UI animation being displayed before quickly closing - as if it crashed
06:37:57 <Biruwa> What is this?
06:42:48 <blueuser[m]> it's accounts for apps
06:43:02 <Biruwa> What does that mean?
06:43:10 <Biruwa> Are these accounts SELinux sandboxes?
06:43:22 <Biruwa> Also, why is it crashing every time I try to add an account?
06:44:08 <blueuser[m]> i don't know why it crash, maybe because there is nothing to add as they are already added
06:44:44 <Biruwa> Thank you.
06:48:20 <Autopsy[m]> <Biruwa "When I click Add account, the in"> Are you just clicking Signal? If so, Signal only allows one account at a time. If there are other apps there that allow multiple accounts, you can add them there.
06:49:45 <Biruwa> Autopsy[m]: Hmmm, maybe that might be the case. I'm not entirely sure though - let me try to remove the signal account and see if there are changes.
06:50:11 <Biruwa> The reason I am asking these questions is because when I opened my Contacts app, it offered to add an account, but upon accepting the app crashed.
06:51:47 <blueuser[m]> the contact app was maybe looking where to save contacts, on phone or google account, but there is no google apps so it's not possible
06:51:56 <Biruwa> Ah, I see.
06:52:03 <Autopsy[m]> I use DAVx5 for contact syncing and does both work and personal. Don't know other than that.
06:52:22 <Biruwa> Okay, what does your Settings > Accounts page look like?
06:52:37 <Biruwa> Does it only have Signal, as it is my case?
06:52:56 <blueuser[m]> yea it's like that
06:52:58 <Biruwa> I presume it lists Signal, as my Signal Messanger app has an account service.
06:52:59 <Biruwa> Okay.
06:53:03 <Biruwa> Ah, that makes sense
06:53:18 <Biruwa> That's why clicking add account crashes the interface, as there is no ability to say, login to a google account
06:53:44 <blueuser[m]> more like no other apps with accounts
06:54:02 <Biruwa> Thank you. I understand now.
06:54:06 <Biruwa> I have a further question.
06:54:54 <Biruwa> I am a user with "reasonable" security needs, and I would like to install some proprietary messaging apps such as Discord and Slack. However, I would also like to be mindful, and somehow compartmentalise or isolate these non-friendly apps, in a way which will minimise my loss of privacy.
06:54:56 <Biruwa> What is the best means to do this?
06:54:59 <blueuser[m]> you can install another apps compatible with the accounts thing and the page will show, eg fenec, linphone, tiny tiny rss or other apps
06:55:17 <Biruwa> blueuser[m] Thank you, I will try that out.
07:04:04 <blueuser[m]> security nerds would recommend using different android user profiles but i just use work profile with the shelter app, bcs it would be a pain to constantly switch profiles, i don't even know if those apps are working without google apps
07:04:33 <Autopsy[m]> <Biruwa "I am a user with "reasonable" se"> You could also set up a user profile and have those apps separated from your main account. However, this would mean switching to the account you need as and when.
07:04:47 <Autopsy[m]> So you won't get notifications and such until you switch over.
07:04:55 <Biruwa> That is acceptable.
07:19:49 <anonymous821[m]> alzxjm: I set lock screen display to "show all notification content", however issue still persists :(
08:15:49 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Ok, not sure if it's Vanadium or site issue
08:44:00 <dazinism> anonymous821: alarm clock doesnt work if battery saver is on. Maybe thats your issue?
08:45:44 <dazinism> Biruwa: Theres a load of info about user profiles at

11:23:59 <anonymous821[m]> dazinism: I don't think it was due to battery saving mode, though will be cognizant of this the next time the alarm does not trigger
11:33:43 <shdudbdjdj[m]> Are they bigger changes to Graphene OS in sight at the moment?
11:44:17 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> None as of the moment
11:44:42 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Mostly fixing the behind-the-scenes stuffs as far as I see (like kernel mitigations)
11:45:23 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Also,be the change that you want to see, is somehow the nature of open source (imho, this is somehow how community open source projects work)
11:46:16 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * None as of the moment (if you mean user-facing). Roadmap is at os-issue-tracker at GrapheneOS github
12:23:26 <dazinism> The migration to Android 11 is the next big change on the horizon. Theres currently limited developer resources to do much more than bug fixes and other maintenance.
12:25:43 <djee737ejdd[m]> How many devs are working on GrapheneOS? I can only see Daniel and Renlord on GitHub. Are they the only 2?
12:30:55 <_renlord> djee737ejdd[m]: anupritaisno1[m] ?
12:31:10 <renlord> also go through the commit logs
12:37:21 <hackerman[m]> <djee737ejdd[m] "How many devs are working on Gra"> Thats why you need to support them. ♥
12:58:47 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2340793 looks like they aren't going to ship 64-bit default for M85 either, although I don't see a reason or bug id anywhere
13:29:27 <renlord> but chrome for android is 64 bit?
13:29:56 <renlord> chrome 85 that is
14:05:40 <cdesai> it was supposed to be, but it isn't
14:05:53 <cdesai> guess there might have been some issue.
15:15:50 <blacktwig[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "blacktwig: the notifications iss"> Thanks for the links. I'll check those out.
16:05:46 <blacktwig[m]> Lmao I'm so dumb thanks for the help aeonsolution
16:16:05 <strcat[m]> hackerman: not everyone who works on it is a member of the organization, and not everyone in the organization has marked it as public
17:17:28 <hackerman[m]> <strcat[m] "hackerman: not everyone who work"> Never said they were. Just tried to convince him to support the developers no matter how many work on the project.
17:19:02 <drkw1z4rd> you know what would be pretty cool is some GrapheneOS Merch
17:19:22 <drkw1z4rd> could potentially be a bit of a revenue stream for the devs other than donations
17:20:51 <nikitalita[m]1> merch is a pretty big hassle; it's a huge bitch if you try and handle it yourself, and trying to do it with third parties like teespring reduces your cut to so little that it's hardly worth it
17:21:25 <drkw1z4rd> with third parties it's definitely volume dependent
17:21:54 <drkw1z4rd> probably wouldn't sell a lot but
17:21:57 <drkw1z4rd> it'd be cool
17:22:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Doubt it.
17:22:33 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * Doubt it'll be done either way
17:23:05 <drkw1z4rd> Do i have permission to make a GrapheneOS tshirt on Redbubble? actually i didn't even check if there was one yet
17:23:42 <drkw1z4rd> there is not
17:25:14 <nikitalita[m]1> i wouldn't do that. so many horror stories of people not associated with a project doing merch for it
17:54:36 <blueuser[m]> one thing that i was looking for is a good sticker to replace the google logo on the back :D
17:59:42 <drkw1z4rd> oh dang that's a great idea.
18:00:06 <drkw1z4rd> I sent an email about it
18:10:42 <likethatt12[m]> https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus/blob/master/Plexus.csv
18:11:15 <likethatt12[m]> Hi you can see how compatible are apps on grapheneOS there
18:12:53 <likethatt12[m]> Luckily Sporify appears to be highly compatible w/o play services
18:52:30 <Autopsy[m]> Spotify is fine.
19:38:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> Spotify doesn't seem like a good way to preserve privacy of your entertainment habits...
19:38:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> Anyway that is off topic.
19:46:57 <dcosk[m]> Its better get a offline music player and download the music on phone
19:55:49 <louipc> i got nice stickers from stickermule before.
20:42:04 <kkarani1[m]> In terms of security and privacy, what's the difference between putting a malicious app in a work profile versus a new user account (recommended)?
20:51:27 <dazinism> Work profiles are owned and controlled by an app, which has more power on what happens in the profile than you
20:51:48 <dazinism> If the app is malicious or exploited it would be bad
20:54:15 <dazinism> Also depending how the app sets up the work profile some stuff can be shared between the personal and work profile
20:58:17 <dazinism> This can be very handy. eg. It can be possible to use share functionality between an app in work and one in personal
20:58:19 <dazinism> The clipboard works across profiles
20:59:57 <dazinism> These can be good, but also could be ways data could be leaked, most likely accidentally
21:02:00 <kkarani1[m]> I was thinking about using shelter as my work profile app.
21:04:29 <dazinism> I use shelter to isolate less trusted apps. I may stop doing so once scoped storage arrives with Android 11
21:04:50 <kkarani1[m]> The advantages that you listed are what I need on a daily basis. I can handle accidents, bc that's my fault. But is there any other clear disadvantage with using shelter vs user account? *Sorry should've been more specific*
21:06:51 <kkarani1[m]> Same, but in previous posts Daniel Micay seems to only advocate the use of user accounts. I'm assuming that might interfere with receiving text messages (say through signal)?
21:09:14 <dazinism> anupritaisno1chatted to the dev, then reported shelter had some security issues, which the dev knew about. Not sure if the latest release fixed these or not.
21:09:20 <dazinism> Also not sure what they were/are
21:12:51 <kkarani1[m]> Oof ok, sorry if i asked some dumb question, I don't know the chat room culture lol first time chatting here, but thanks man for the help man.
21:13:45 <dazinism> I think Daniels recommendation is mainly due to the app having control of the profile - its a significant hole in security and privacy for anything running in the profile
21:15:08 <dazinism> Compared to using a separate user profile
21:15:13 <dazinism> It would be great if someone made the user profiles more useful. Its something  that is wanted in GrapheneOS
21:16:54 <dazinism> Theres some controls that are available for corporate device control, but not currently exposed to users in GrapheneOS which would be great to have
21:19:10 <dazinism> Theres some controls that are available for corporate device control, but not currently exposed to users in GrapheneOS which would be great to have
21:19:24 <dazinism> Theres some controls that are available for corporate device control, but not currently exposed to users in GrapheneOS which would be great to have
21:19:27 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager#startUserInBackground(android.content.ComponentName,%20android.os.UserHandle)
21:19:33 <dazinism> That one and, even better, the next, ability to stop user profiles
21:19:55 <kkarani1[m]> Yupp that would be sweeeet
21:21:20 <dazinism> I was thinking an app designed for sharing data between profiles would be nice as well
21:21:53 <dazinism> Could use on device networking via 127.0.0.1 to transfer data
21:23:35 <dazinism> The app could work on any android with multiple user profiles
21:28:21 <dazinism> Would have to somehow set up encryption so other apps on device couldnt snoop on data
21:32:22 <dazinism> The other things from the device policy manager page linked above that may be nice to have exposed to users would be network logging and wipe device after x failed unlock password attempts
21:36:28 <dazinism> <kkarani1[m] "Yupp that would be sweeeet"> A good thing about work profiles is that you can easily freeze apps or turn off the whole profile
21:37:36 <dazinism> Frozen apps are shut down more than an app that has been force stopped
21:38:11 <dazinism> doesn't show in the launcher and other apps can no longer see it
21:38:30 <dazinism> Also cant see it in android settings > apps
21:39:58 <dazinism> kkarani1: in case you've not seen, this may be useful https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
21:47:33 <kkarani1[m]> Oh cool thanks I'll check it out! Btw do you guys know if apps that have full network access and view network connections permissions in a work profile are able to extend that outside of the work profile? I don't know how to say this in technical terms but is the network split software wise between the work profile and the "personal" profile? Or is it all "one"? (Bc if it is "one," then that is a major negative for
21:47:33 <kkarani1[m]> work profile)
21:49:21 <kkarani1[m]> Wait that's in the link, nvm
21:51:03 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I think its one, no?
21:51:39 <kkarani1[m]> "Until Android Q Apps in one user profile could see that other apps making network connections, what these connections are, but the app name is kept anonymous. This information is made available to apps by viewing /proc/net. Android 10 Q blocks app access to /proc/net which stops this inter profile information leak.
21:51:39 <kkarani1[m]> You can view this network data, which is available to any app in a given user profile by installing the Net Monitor app available from the FDroid app repository"

22:01:55 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <SEWaRybdALEy[m] "> <@kkarani1:privacytools.io> "C"> okay most likely a question, so...theoretically, you can run NetGuard in your work profile and a VPN in your main?
22:05:04 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> nvm, I just did
22:05:11 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> feels like immortal right now
22:11:54 <dazinism> SEWaRybdALEy: NetGuard isn't really necessary in GrapheneOS as you can set Network Permission for apps.
22:12:40 <dazinism> Although it can be nice seeing where/when apps are making connections
22:13:47 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I know but Netguard to me is like a kill switch, so I dont have to turn everything off one by one
22:14:14 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> that being said I only have like 10 apps in my shelter profile anyway but im lazy
22:14:44 <dazinism> It is however a bit of a security privacy hole. If its malicious/exploited it has complete control of networking, can block or mess with network connections
22:17:45 <dazinism> Can set up to auto freeze on apps in shelter, and add the freeze icon to home screen,  or just switch off the work profile with the switch at the bottom of the app launcher

22:19:31 <kkarani1[m]> That's one of the great things in grapheneOS that seems like a no brainer, but android hasn't even thought about implementing. This (network permissions) and sensors toggle. Wild.
22:20:11 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> ............
22:20:14 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> you are right......
22:20:20 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> geez I feel like a dumbass now
22:20:38 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> oh but one scenario is my spotify, sadly............
22:20:46 <kkarani1[m]> Both right now are system wide and hella inconvenient on stock android in settings
22:20:58 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I want it to work, but dont you dare talking to the network
22:21:12 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I can simply just download and turn off the network.....
22:21:24 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> god its been almost 1 year on graphene now and I just thought of this......
22:22:32 <kkarani1[m]> <SEWaRybdALEy[m] "okay most likely a question, so."> Yeah, I often turn on VPN on both sides lol
22:24:55 <dazinism> Not sure exactly how reliably that works. Pretty sure can only have any one user profile connecting to a VPN at a time. Not sure about the work profile and personal profile
22:25:53 <kkarani1[m]> <dazinism "Although it can be nice seeing w"> What app are you using to do that?
22:27:30 <dazinism> NetGuard has that as  one of the free features.
22:27:47 <kkarani1[m]> <SEWaRybdALEy[m] "god its been almost 1 year on gr"> Lol oof, happens man
22:27:48 <dazinism> Think you get a nicer interface to logs if you pay
22:33:04 <dazinism> Theres also PCAPdroid on the izzyondroid fdroid repo that allows you to capture network traffic
22:33:07 <dazinism> izzyondroid repo is all open source apps
22:33:40 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <kkarani1[m] "Lol oof, happens man"> thank you. Feels so embarrassed....
22:33:41 <h3rb_> Hi there was a reddit on grapheneos about gcam. Can we install gcam on grapheneos?
22:33:51 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> <h3rb_ "Hi there was a reddit on graphen"> yep
22:34:07 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> although I dont see how its a monumental improvement, feels just meh
22:34:32 <h3rb_> How can I install gcam please help
22:35:18 <SEWaRybdALEy[m]> I just downloaded from xda lol, I know its not the most secure way of doing things....
22:36:15 <h3rb_> Does it click good photographs as compared to stock cam on graphene?
22:36:40 <dazinism> izzyondroid repository has recently had the gcam service  provider app added
22:37:42 <h3rb_> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
22:37:54 <h3rb_> What is this exactly?
22:48:50 <h3rb_> Ruppi
22:54:59 <cdesai> strcat[m]: sunfish apv is done.
