00:00:20 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Yeah but whats wrong with GPL3"> too restrictive for the project
00:00:35 <cn3m[m]> it's in the FAQ one sec let me find it
00:01:28 <cn3m[m]> never mind my bad it is not in the faq or the contribution section of the build guide
00:13:11 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: we want it to be permitted to make devices with GrapheneOS that don't support unlocking the bootloader
00:13:28 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: so we can't include any GPLv3 code since then people couldn't do that with GrapheneOS
00:13:48 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: we can certainly distribute builds of GPLv3 apps via a first party repository
00:13:52 <strcat[m]> they just can't be preinstalled
00:14:14 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: so what I want to do is just hide the sample calendar app and keep that around for the CTS
00:14:26 <strcat[m]> and if people want to install Etar they can do that
00:14:40 <strcat[m]> and when we have a first party repo it's one of the apps that could be in there
00:26:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> JollyRoger signal it's imports
00:26:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> * JollyRoger signal it's important
01:34:53 <RiotElement[m]> Does anyone know if Graphene OS has a built in read aloud feature or recommend a read aloud app?
01:59:32 <RiotElement[m]> Does anyone know if Graphene OS can take live pictures?
02:05:03 <cn3m[m]> <RiotElement[m] "Does anyone know if Graphene OS "> TTSUtil with Google Text to Speech works for me
04:12:34 <greenmoon[m]> I have been told here that force stopping an app would prevent it from starting again if you don't explicitly start by clicking on the icon but it's false I have an app using sdk29 (user land) that still randomly start even when force stopped.
04:12:54 <greenmoon[m]> * I have been told here that force stopping an app would prevent it from starting again if you don't explicitly start by clicking on the icon but it's false I have an app using sdk29 (Userland) that still randomly start even when force stopped.
04:18:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Apps can start even if force stopped
04:18:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Other apps can wake them up
04:18:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> GCM, although not present on graphene is an example
04:18:53 <RiotElement[m]> Their alarm clocks can also wake them up
04:19:15 <greenmoon[m]> Yea I see

04:29:52 <greenmoon[m]> Was mislead by that, probably wrongly understand
05:41:42 <strcat[m]> RiotElement: force stopping an app removes jobs/alarms
05:41:52 <strcat[m]> and a fresh installed app cannot have those anyway
05:44:19 <strcat[m]> greenmoon: you're probably doing something wrong
05:44:34 <strcat[m]> per the security model an app that is force stopped can't start itself
05:44:48 <strcat[m]> if you find a way to bypass that report the vulnerability for a bounty
05:44:51 <strcat[m]> you probably didn't.
05:45:48 <strcat[m]> greenmoon: perhaps you're confusing 'force close' for an unresponsive app with force stopping it
06:25:28 <greenmoon[m]> I found out what was starting the stopped app, it is the file app.
06:25:42 <greenmoon[m]> File manager
07:58:23 <dazinism> greenmoon: yeah, I'd been  a bit confused, but came to conclusion apps could be started by other apps.
07:58:45 <dazinism> Wondering when file manager is starting apps? Guessing its when you tap a file type which only that app supports?

08:06:58 <dazinism> I'd come to my conclusion by using apps_Packages info
08:07:23 <dazinism> Using that to launch some activities of an app
08:09:38 <Syrillic[m]> When the pixel 5 releases how long do you guys think it will take GrapheneOS to support?
08:09:50 <dazinism> I'd noticed that force stop doesnt work reliably with apps running in a Shelter created work profile
08:10:45 <dazinism> Syrillic: it needs someone to step up to work on porting Garphene to any new device.
08:11:14 <Syrillic[m]> Makes sense but currently graphene supports all pixel devices?
08:11:37 <dazinism> Also unlikely a new device will be added while its on a different version of AOSP
08:12:38 <Syrillic[m]> What’s AOSP?
08:12:58 <cn3m[m]> Android Open Source Project
08:13:09 <Syrillic[m]> Ahh makes sense
08:13:20 <Syrillic[m]> So what device do you guys recommend for GrapheneOS
08:13:22 <Syrillic[m]> Currently
08:13:48 <cn3m[m]> the FAQ covers it very well
08:14:06 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
08:14:13 <greenmoon[m]> <dazinism "I'd noticed that force stop does"> I use his freeze feature for shelter its more powerful I think, you can add an icon to do it

08:15:16 <cn3m[m]> <greenmoon[m] "I use his freeze feature for she"> it is really crap actually
08:15:27 <cn3m[m]> using client side checks
08:15:32 <greenmoon[m]> Not u
08:15:43 <Syrillic[m]> <cn3m[m] "the FAQ covers it very well"> Thanks
08:15:48 <cn3m[m]> if you want to actually disable an app in shelter use the switch in the launcher to log off the whole profile
08:16:37 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 is the most secure with the longer support. 3a is really reliable and great for value and support
08:17:53 <dazinism> New devices start on a different aosp branch and it tends to be a few months until all existing devices move to the same branch.
08:19:18 <greenmoon[m]> <cn3m[m] "using client side checks"> You say bs, the app is actually disabled you can see it in Settings-Applications-see all apps-work apps
08:19:29 <greenmoon[m]> * Thats bs, the app is actually disabled you can see it in Settings-Applications-see all apps-work apps
08:19:45 <dazinism> So the quickest it will happen is about 3 months from a device being launched. If someone (or company)works on porting GrapheneOS and someone commits to being the maintainer of the device.
08:22:11 <dazinism> Yeah, using shelter to freeze apps apparently does do a really strong shutdown.
08:22:32 <dazinism> Can't see them from settings>apps anymore
08:22:38 <dazinism> Or app launcher
08:22:48 <dazinism> Other apps can no longer see them
08:22:54 <cn3m[m]> I will give it a test might have been thinking of the other one
08:22:59 <cn3m[m]> what is that one called?
08:23:14 <dazinism> Theres Super Freezz
08:23:19 <dazinism> Never tried it
08:23:21 <cn3m[m]> wait no I am thinking of greenify and one called Freez
08:23:26 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "Theres Super Freezz"> oh that
08:25:24 <dazinism> I got the idea that Super Freezz may be a way to more easily  'force stop' apps. But I could be completely wrong as I've not tried it.
08:25:55 <greenmoon[m]> We were speaking about the freeze feature of shelter
08:26:09 <greenmoon[m]> Superfreeze is just force stopping
08:27:17 <cn3m[m]> greenify is a stupid way too
08:27:22 <cn3m[m]> and there is another
08:28:08 * greenmoon[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200723-102751.png (44KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/wJOiaqoRWFAXwdYPmrqCujxV >
08:28:38 <greenmoon[m]> Dazim all those apps are freezed i made a folder on desktop to turn them on quickly
08:28:56 <greenmoon[m]> Dazinism*
08:28:59 <dazinism> Yeah I get the idea Super Freezz is the open source answer to Greenify. Imagine they work the same way, but I could be wrong
08:29:33 <cn3m[m]> Anyone know if the VPN leak has been fixed?
08:30:06 <cn3m[m]> my bad on shelter good catch guys
08:30:31 <dazinism> greenmoon: yeah, I make homescreen icons to unfreeze apps that I freeze in shelter
08:31:16 <dazinism> That includes signal, as I dont use it much and it can, under some conditions, eat a whole load of battery real quick.
08:32:02 <greenmoon[m]> Ya signal is battery hungry sadly even with the recent battery fix
08:34:23 <dazinism> Apps really vanish from the device when they are froozen in shelter. Without the unfreeze shortcuts the only way to find a trace of them is looking in the shelter app. And they are hidden right at the bottom of the work tab.
08:41:35 <tvg[m]> Hi I'm kind of new to using customROM's and I have a question
08:41:35 <tvg[m]> If I understand it correctly, installing GraphenOS will delete any memory on my device. This isn't a concern for me, because I'll be using an out-of-the-box new phone.
08:41:35 <tvg[m]> I am however unsure what to do with my SIM card. Is it best to just pop it in, after I get Graphene up and running? Or should my SIM already be inserted during the installation and should I back up for example my contacts on it?
08:42:41 <dazinism> tvg: it should be fine to stick it in after
08:42:58 <dazinism> you've installed GrapheneOS
08:43:05 <anonymouserobot[> I wish Etar had a widget though :(
08:43:35 <tvg[m]> <dazinism "tvg: it should be fine to stick "> Thank you so much!
08:44:05 <dazinism> tvg: no problem
08:44:23 <greenmoon[m]> Yea but don't the 3a require internet access to unlock the bootloader? I think I have read that somewhere
08:44:34 <greenmoon[m]> Unlike precious models
08:44:43 <greenmoon[m]> Previous*
08:45:25 <dazinism> greenmoon: oh yeah, think my 3XL did.
08:45:52 <greenmoon[m]> :/
08:46:30 <greenmoon[m]> Can you just use WiFi?
08:46:47 <greenmoon[m]> Without sim
08:48:02 <tvg[m]> So just connect my device to our WiFi before installing Graphene and still insert the SIM afterwards?
08:48:03 <tvg[m]> Like that?
08:49:04 <greenmoon[m]> Idk, I was asking also
08:52:12 <dazinism> Yeah I just used WiFi
08:52:40 <dazinism> Well, it was a while ago, but I'm pretty sure
08:54:13 <takama02[m]> May I ask how much of a ram does system takes on your pixel 3a. I think out of box mine was around 1,5gb and while iddle the battery wouldn't drop a single %. Now on 2gb it drains faster, not sure if I caused it be downloading some fishy app or just switching to unstable beta.
08:56:03 <greenmoon[m]> Check the battery stats but ram usage isn't what is draining your battery
08:58:48 <takama02[m]> May turn on battery saver but no app runs in background anyway
09:00:11 <takama02[m]> Usually I've experience things like airplane, battery saver mode not turning off sensors doesn't help at all
09:01:24 <takama02[m]> Based on usage the top is launcher
09:03:00 <greenmoon[m]> From my experience low/poor signal strength drain faster also
09:03:44 <greenmoon[m]> I have also read that on the internet, not sure if true but I think it is
09:03:46 <takama02[m]> Hm that may be it, constantly turning on and off the Wi-Fi
09:05:45 <SchismXL[m]> Is there a way of changing the refresh rate in adb?
09:06:59 <SchismXL[m]> I'm slowly losing my mind with the green flickering and I'm not a fan of dark mode, so battery saver is a no go at the mo.
09:07:37 <SchismXL[m]> And I'm not a full brightness type of guy.
09:07:47 <dazinism> Poor cell reception definately uses more battery. Particularly if you are changing 4g to 3g a lot
09:08:14 <greenmoon[m]> Damn this flickering thing is really bad
09:08:44 <greenmoon[m]> Can't u get a replacement? All phones are affected? Its not covered by warranty?
09:12:58 <SchismXL[m]> It only seems to be on the 4XL (iirc). It is to do with the gamma calibration at 90hz. 60hz is fine. Yesterday, I tried the stock ROM, AOSiP, LineageOS GSI, and phhusson's GSI ROM. All but stock had the flickering. I tested the CleanSlate kernel and used the corresponding app, but I don't trust it.
09:13:25 <greenmoon[m]> :/
09:14:24 <travankor_> someone posted a custom kernel page that fixes the flickering
09:14:32 <SchismXL[m]> So, Google have issued a fix, but it just isn't implemented in AOSP ROMs yet
09:15:02 <travankor_> wait, it’s fixed upstream?
09:15:16 <SchismXL[m]> <travankor_ "someone posted a custom kernel p"> Yeah, CleanSlate? Used it. It is okay, but a hacky fix and I don't want to use any other kernel.
09:15:33 <greenmoon[m]> Yea that's a pretty bad idea
09:15:36 <SchismXL[m]> It must be fixed upstream, as I don't get flickering using the stock ROM.
09:16:03 <travankor_> hmm so graphene just needs to update their build, then
09:16:15 <travankor_> unless the stock build uses proprietary stuff
09:18:03 <SchismXL[m]> I'd kill, donate, pay, reach around, rusty trombone or anything to have the option to enable or disable 90hz, tbh.
09:18:53 <SchismXL[m]> Without having to opt for battery saving and the dark mode. Dunno why dark mode themes are so popular, I've never got into it.
09:19:31 <travankor_> 90hz seems like a mistake in general
09:20:41 <SchismXL[m]> Don't get me wrong, it is smooth as silk and there is a noticeable difference if you have two devices side by side. But for day to day usage, it doesn't make a great deal of sense
09:21:20 <greenmoon[m]> Some new phones have 120hz 👀
09:21:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> <SchismXL[m] "I'd kill, donate, pay, reach aro"> It's not possible. Hope that answers your question
09:21:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google did something to the rotation control app
09:21:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> It no longer works
09:22:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> At least not on custom roms
09:22:13 <travankor_> srs??
09:22:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
09:22:21 <SchismXL[m]> Saw the ASUS Rog reviews yesterday. Gaming, yes. Everything else, no.
09:22:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> They also refuse to fix it
09:23:21 <Jimmehh[m]> hello, i have asked about this before, but if choosing a new phone was determined between imessages and maybe app selection, would a iphone or pixel be better? i keep seeing plenty about how iphones are "bad" now, or not quite as good for security
09:23:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Saw the ASUS Rog reviews yesterd"> Tbh I don't have any problem whatsoever with 90hz
09:23:58 <Jimmehh[m]> app selection being access to some apps not available to non google play services apps
09:24:07 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "hello, i have asked about this b"> here one sec the lead dev has a good writeup
09:24:25 <cn3m[m]> you can't go wrong with either a pixel or iphone but read this

09:28:06 <Jimmehh[m]> i'll check that post out some more

09:29:06 <Jimmehh[m]> ios just seems so convenient over android
09:29:19 <cn3m[m]> I'd get an iPhone as a daily and a used Pixel for development?
09:29:27 <Jimmehh[m]> but id love to support graphene if possible
09:29:37 <Jimmehh[m]> i got an 8 plus as of now
09:29:56 <Jimmehh[m]> and id like a phone that isn't vulnerable to checkm8 and i won't jailbreak lol
09:30:16 <greenmoon[m]> Oh a phone for you, not for your mom lol I have read it wrongly.
09:30:31 <cn3m[m]> checkm8 is not a big concern. You have the SEP. Whenever you leave your device unattended reboot it
09:30:32 <Jimmehh[m]> oh yeah, like i said i'm kinda drunk lol
09:30:42 <cn3m[m]> the bigger thing it is missing is PAC, but not the end of the world either
09:30:58 <Jimmehh[m]> well i have concerns now of sep being bypassed and i don't know the extent of the big
09:31:09 <Jimmehh[m]> * well i have concerns now of sep being bypassed and i don't know the extent of the bug
09:31:28 <cn3m[m]> SEP is very secure I wouldn't worry about them bypassing verified boot
09:32:12 <Jimmehh[m]> i wouldn't mind staying on an iphone 8 plus(arm64) but i would like to have this jailbroken at all times cause i do jailbreak development and app development and i don't have a mac yet
09:32:18 <cn3m[m]> checkm8 isn't that practical to pull off. Someone needs to take your phone, put it in DFU, and get it back to you and hope you don't reboot it
09:32:44 <Jimmehh[m]> yeah i understand that, but the concerns above are the problem
09:33:21 <cn3m[m]> well sounds like you know what you want it is just budget
09:33:27 <Jimmehh[m]> imessages, access to apps, and jailbreaking
09:33:34 <Jimmehh[m]> not so much access to apps
09:33:39 <Jimmehh[m]> but maybe a little
09:33:58 <Jimmehh[m]> i can live without snapchat and stuff if i have other apps, or even a phone number
09:34:01 <cn3m[m]> jailbreaking is a security concern almost as bad as rooting Android
09:34:16 <cn3m[m]> I would not recommend it
09:34:17 <Jimmehh[m]> but i would prefer imessages
09:34:39 <Jimmehh[m]> yeah that's why i would like a pixel or an se if they are not vulnerable to the sep bug or exploit
09:34:48 <Jimmehh[m]> more so pixel cause i love android
09:34:55 <cn3m[m]> yeah then get an iPhone and a used Pixel(for dev)
09:35:01 <Jimmehh[m]> but the main concern is getting people to use signal or something
09:35:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> My PC from 2001 is not vulnerable to SEP pls buy it from me
09:35:09 <cn3m[m]> there is no sep bug
09:35:17 <cn3m[m]> that is a bootrom issue
09:35:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's collecting dust
09:35:32 <Jimmehh[m]> and signal even seems to be having questionable decisions recently
09:36:01 <cn3m[m]> even the iPhone 5s from 7 years ago the SEP is just fine. The iPhone 5 is the only one with the major checkm8 issues
09:36:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: Jimmehh reminder that this is not iPhone chat
09:36:06 <cn3m[m]> since no SEP
09:36:25 <Jimmehh[m]> <cn3m[m] "there is no sep bug"> cn3m: no there is one from like as of today, checkra1n devs mentioned before but it's bing brought up WAY more today
09:36:35 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "My PC from 2001 is not vulnerabl"> I will give you 200
09:36:47 <cn3m[m]> cents
09:37:10 <Jimmehh[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: Jimmehh reminder that this"> yes but iphone vs pixel is a major thing i'd say, not trying to flood the chat. just trying to get some advice
09:37:53 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "cn3m: no there is one from like "> right same goes for Titan M or anything
09:37:57 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "yes but iphone vs pixel is a maj"> It is well covered is the point
09:38:04 <cn3m[m]> you have your answer
09:38:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh both are overpriced bricks
09:38:21 <cn3m[m]> you can't go wrong with either
09:38:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Toss a coin
09:38:33 <Jimmehh[m]> hmmm, maybe i'm too decisive
09:38:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Buy whatever the coin says
09:38:47 <Jimmehh[m]> i feel like i'll always pick the wrong decision
09:39:13 <cn3m[m]> flip a coin yes
09:39:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Regardless of what it says you'll be buying an overpriced brick so don't worry about it
09:39:23 <Jimmehh[m]> <cn3m[m] "right same goes for Titan M or a"> titan m hasn't had any public vulnerabilities to my knowledge yet
09:39:42 <Jimmehh[m]> well i think problem is means of communication
09:39:45 <Jimmehh[m]> ios has imessages
09:39:54 <Jimmehh[m]> android has well, signal that's about it
09:40:02 <travankor_> I like the pixel A series
09:40:03 <Jimmehh[m]> i've had a hard time getting people to use signal
09:40:54 <Jimmehh[m]> am i just too needy? lmao
09:41:07 <cn3m[m]> the SEP and Titan M are both great either could fall but probably won't. Outside of 99% of people's threat models
09:41:41 <cn3m[m]> Jimmehh: you probably should ask the offtopic chat this is not relevant anymore
09:41:42 <Jimmehh[m]> ohhh thread model, good point. always forget that
09:42:02 <cn3m[m]> you got everything you need to answer that question yourself
09:42:08 <Jimmehh[m]> where's the off topic. mobile element is weird
09:42:36 <Jimmehh[m]> always found it to be a pain to join other chats
09:42:39 <Jimmehh[m]> especially find them
09:42:47 <cn3m[m]> tbh your PC is way more insecure and less private than either of these phones. Neither would be a weakpoint. Just use what you want. GrapheneOS has more freedom
09:43:09 <Jimmehh[m]> i actually don't have a pc as of now lol, but i understand
09:44:06 <cn3m[m]> #freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
09:44:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> cn3m: brb gonna deblob kernel
09:44:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will run it on my enemy's PC
09:44:41 <Jimmehh[m]> thank you
09:44:54 <cn3m[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "cn3m: brb gonna deblob kernel "> add a little in the kernel instead
09:45:06 <cn3m[m]> flappy bird kernel game
09:46:27 <Jimmehh[m]> this has been something in the back of my head for a while tbh, that's why i ask so many stupid questions
09:46:28 <Jimmehh[m]> i love android, but i wanna get in into ios development mainly
09:47:19 <cn3m[m]> keep you 8 plus and play with Android in the development emulator(maybe build GrapheneOS)
09:47:30 <cn3m[m]> see what you fall for
09:48:00 <cn3m[m]> your iPhone 8 Plus is perfectly fine don't worry about checkm8 just reboot your device whenever you leave it unattended. That is always good advice though
09:48:21 <Jimmehh[m]> well even going back to my old android(still gets custom rom support) i wanna switch lol
09:48:28 <cn3m[m]> you can build and use GrapheneOS in a VM get a feel for it
09:48:35 <cn3m[m]> mess around with Android dev
09:49:17 <Jimmehh[m]> one of the main things about graphene that kind makes me not wanna switch is there is no "anti-theft" protection
09:49:24 <Jimmehh[m]> but i understand why
09:49:32 <Jimmehh[m]> it just isn't the goal of the project
09:49:53 <cn3m[m]> anti theft is bullshit
09:50:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> I mean there is anti theft protection
09:50:06 <Jimmehh[m]> i do only keep my phone in my hand or pocket though
09:50:15 <cn3m[m]> it's herd immunity which is good, but no thief is going to know you don't have it
09:50:33 <Jimmehh[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "I mean there is anti theft prote"> i don't remember there being any or even any half anti theft protection
09:50:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "i do only keep my phone in my ha"> Amateur
09:50:52 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "i do only keep my phone in my ha"> keep your phone and spend your money on PC. If you want to be a dev you need a PC
09:50:58 <cn3m[m]> this is just weird
09:51:28 <cn3m[m]> you have a perfectly fine flagship from not too long ago and you have no PC and want to develop?
09:51:39 <Jimmehh[m]> yeah i need a pc, i'm probably just gonna get a pinebook pro for the time being, it seems to be able to do anything i need and some
09:51:46 <cn3m[m]> what?
09:51:48 <Jimmehh[m]> and is quite affordable
09:52:22 <Jimmehh[m]> i develop on my phone lol
09:52:27 <Jimmehh[m]> as much as a hassle it is
09:52:41 <cn3m[m]> I'd get a refurbished PC or maybe a used one
09:52:42 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Speaking of anti-theft, how does iOS compare to GrapheneOS
09:52:42 <Jimmehh[m]> and i can see how it limits and makes me unproductive
09:52:46 <cn3m[m]> Thinkpad
09:53:00 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "i develop on my phone lol"> that is just a bad idea
09:53:03 <cn3m[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Speaking of anti-theft, how does"> don't worry about anti theft
09:53:11 <cn3m[m]> at all
09:53:21 <Jimmehh[m]> well thinkpad was a consideration, but i'd probably need to upgrade it either way so a pinebook pro seems fine for my needs
09:53:26 <cn3m[m]> it is a misnomer
09:53:32 <Jimmehh[m]> <cn3m[m] "that is just a bad idea"> it really is, but it works for now
09:53:33 <cn3m[m]> search anti theft in the logs
09:54:03 <cn3m[m]> anti theft is to destroy the value of the device. It doesn't help you. The theif has no idea you don't use it
09:54:09 <cn3m[m]> makes no difference to him
09:54:21 <Jimmehh[m]> don't have anything too major i'm working on besides an app, but i doubt imma finish it on my phone, i'll probably get a laptop before then
09:54:24 <cn3m[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#anti-theft
09:54:37 <cn3m[m]> iOS technically has anti theft, but I don't use it
09:54:45 <cn3m[m]> it is moot
09:55:45 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <cn3m[m] "iOS technically has anti theft, "> If I remember correctly, you can also reformat iOS to factory
09:55:49 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Right?
09:55:58 <Jimmehh[m]> remotely ? yes
09:56:05 <cn3m[m]> not bypassing the lock no
09:56:09 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * If I remember correctly, you can also reformat iOS to factory defaults
09:56:29 <cn3m[m]> anti theft is destroying the value of the device
09:56:31 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not even their recovery?
09:56:36 <Jimmehh[m]> yeah if you have the passcode you can
09:56:40 <cn3m[m]> that does no good for me
09:56:57 <cn3m[m]> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Not even their recovery?"> no the lock is permanent
09:57:01 <Jimmehh[m]> you could recover but you'd still need a passcode
09:57:09 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS tried it out once irrc, but people forgot their passwords and lost money.
09:57:12 <Jimmehh[m]> iirc the passcode is stored on the device itself
09:57:18 <Jimmehh[m]> not cloud
09:57:19 <cn3m[m]> it is just a terrible idea
09:57:20 <cn3m[m]> don't worry about it
09:57:26 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yeah that
09:57:47 <Jimmehh[m]> so the passcode needs to match the last one entered or set on the device
09:57:54 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <cn3m[m] "GrapheneOS tried it out once irr"> Whoa, alright. iOS parts is valuable anyways so yeah lol
09:57:54 <Jimmehh[m]> it never gets wiped
09:57:56 <cn3m[m]> no thief is going to know if you use it or not
09:58:02 <cn3m[m]> it isn't going to stop him
09:58:27 <cn3m[m]> don't use anti theft and don't ask for it
09:58:44 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yeah just curious tbh
09:58:47 <Jimmehh[m]> that is kind true, and to think of about it no one would steal a pixel around here lmao
09:59:06 <Jimmehh[m]> people only have iphones
09:59:09 <cn3m[m]> it is fine on iOS or Stock Android but
09:59:11 <cn3m[m]> you still run a risk
09:59:15 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Kinda true lol
09:59:28 <cn3m[m]> if you get locked out of your account(more of an Android concern)
09:59:37 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <cn3m[m] "you still run a risk"> I'm all ears
10:00:04 <cn3m[m]> anti theft is designed to destory the value of the device
10:00:12 <cn3m[m]> that can happen to you
10:00:31 <Jimmehh[m]> i think the only things i'd miss from ios is a few apps, mainly stardew valley and some music production apps like garageband and such
10:00:53 <Jimmehh[m]> not to get too off track again
10:01:27 <cn3m[m]> get an iPad and have a Pixel that is where I am at
10:01:48 <cn3m[m]> you can even iMessage with your email address
10:02:26 <Jimmehh[m]> i was thinking i could remake some apps, like this app called chordology, basically shows how to play chords for piano, guitar, and ukulele
10:02:33 <Jimmehh[m]> and almost all positions for them
10:03:08 <Jimmehh[m]> i have yet to find something like that for android or fdroid more specifically
10:03:43 <Jimmehh[m]> <cn3m[m] "you can even iMessage with your "> android doesn't have an easy way to send them though, correct?
10:04:06 <cn3m[m]> no
10:04:22 <Jimmehh[m]> hmmm, that kinda sucks. like a lot lol
10:04:26 <Jimmehh[m]> damnit apple
10:05:16 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <cn3m[m] "that can happen to you"> In short, double-edged sword, got it
10:07:27 <geritol[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "damnit apple"> iMessage wouldn't work on Android even if they wanted it too iirc
10:07:43 <Jimmehh[m]> why's that?
10:08:05 <geritol[m]> The whole number integration and how they do the crypto
10:08:23 <geritol[m]> It wouldn't be easy at least, probably impossible
10:09:08 <Jimmehh[m]> to my knowledge i guess it's completely possible, but i've only read into the papers they have on it and looked into some of the headers for frameworks and the app
10:09:10 <Jimmehh[m]> so idk
10:47:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> https://www.reddit.com/gallery/hw0gyi
10:47:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not a feature request but how feasible is this to be translated on Android
10:48:12 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * https://www.reddit.com/gallery/hw0gyi
10:48:12 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Not a feature request but how feasible is this to have an equivalent implementatiom on Android
10:48:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> It feels like overhauling some SELinux policies (not sure) and having to restrict the storage permissions
11:01:39 <chaology> i saw a mention in the channel that there's no fix for the pixel 4 XL flicker issues, well apart from whacking the brightness up to max
11:02:08 <chaology> i guess i'll just use dark mode at night on high brightness
11:02:42 <chaology> i should have done some more research before buying this this model for grapheneos
11:03:33 <cdesai> there was a mention of a fix in the R beta 2.5 release
11:03:52 <chaology> cdesai: oh cool
11:04:02 <chaology> that's good news
11:04:08 <cdesai> "The screen no longer flickers on some devices when the screen is set to a low brightness level. (Issue #156051413)"
11:04:33 <chaology> i'll take a look
11:05:22 <chaology> also does anyone use orbot on grapheneos ?
11:05:27 <chaology> didn't work for me
11:06:01 <chaology> i guess that's the apps fault and not grapheneos
11:06:11 <chaology> s/apps/app's
11:06:15 -SEdbot[m]- > <@freenode_chaology:matrix.org> i guess that's the apps fault and not grapheneos

11:40:38 <x61[m]> I am having a problem with my lycamobile sim, I cannot send sms
11:40:45 <x61[m]> I can recive without problems, but can't send
11:40:47 <x61[m]> any idea?
11:40:57 <x61[m]> I have a Pixel 3a with the lastest
11:45:06 <kryptonymous[m]> 𝚐𝚘𝚗𝚣𝚊𝚕𝚘: Best thing to do in this instance is to contact your carrier's technical support and have them verify your SIM settings. Strangely I lost mine after a recent upgrade and had to do the same. I'm sure they'll help.
11:45:55 <g65434-2[m]> <x61[m] "I am having a problem with my ly"> is your phone carrier locked?
11:46:00 <x61[m]> nop
11:46:30 <x61[m]> there is a way to set the SMS gateway?
11:46:41 <g65434-2[m]> mh, maybe its your sim then, is it working otherwise on another phone'
11:47:51 <x61[m]> they call it: Message Centre Number (MCN)
11:49:23 <kryptonymous[m]> 𝚐𝚘𝚗𝚣𝚊𝚕𝚘: By "SIM settings", I meant APN settings. It's late...🙂
11:49:27 <x61[m]> plus I think anoter bug I found while trying to fix this, is if you modifiy an APN MCC and MNC it doesnt save the APN
11:50:54 <x61[m]> <g65434-2[m] "mh, maybe its your sim then, is "> I dont have another to try, buut I could
13:14:50 <dazinism> chaology: I've been using orbot for years with GrapheneOS, generally without issues. When there has been problems its due to orbot. Try a different build.
13:15:01 <dazinism> Version.
13:15:56 <dazinism> Guess you may have problems if you are running it in VPN mode, while also running another app using androids VPN functionality

13:28:24 <tvg[m]> I'm running Windows 10 and I watchted Techlore's tutorial on YouTube, but his guide seemed pretty much the same as the official one
13:28:36 <overheadscallop[> nope, Techlore's video is out of date
13:28:43 <overheadscallop[> people keep coming here because of it
13:29:09 <tvg[m]> Oh sorry, I didn't know
13:29:11 <overheadscallop[> Ok, does that mean you edited the `flash-all.bat` script?
13:29:21 <overheadscallop[> to remove the version check
13:29:32 <tvg[m]> I did, because it kept saying fastboot was out-dated
13:29:46 <overheadscallop[> the check was meant to prevent the exact scenario you currently have
13:30:01 <overheadscallop[> have you tried entering fastboot mode on your phone?
13:30:07 <overheadscallop[> and what device do you have
13:30:19 <tvg[m]> Pixel 3a
13:30:28 <overheadscallop[> you can try getting to fastboot mode by powering off completely and press power + vol down keys
13:31:10 <overheadscallop[> if you can get to fastboot we can try reflashing properly
13:31:23 <tvg[m]> I'm here now on my phone
13:31:43 <tvg[m]> It's in fastbood mode and the device state is currently locked
13:31:59 <overheadscallop[> ok first we need to fix the environment on your pc
13:32:34 <overheadscallop[> did you download and unzip the platform tools from google?
13:32:47 <tvg[m]> I did, yes
13:32:53 <overheadscallop[> ok
13:33:01 <RiotElement[m]> <overheadscallop[ "nope, Techlore's video is out of"> Also use the new program that’s linked on the Graphene OS download website. The “simple” program from TechLore’s video gave me this issue too.
13:33:22 <overheadscallop[> So open up a new powershell and navigate to the folder right above the unzipped platform tools folder

13:36:55 <overheadscallop[> ok very good
13:37:18 <overheadscallop[> you can plug in your phone to the pc

13:38:34 <overheadscallop[> ok, do you still have the zip file for the grapheneos factory image?
13:38:49 <overheadscallop[> I would like you to delete the unzipped files you edited and unzip it again
13:39:01 <overheadscallop[> to get a fresh version of the scripts

13:41:51 <tvg[m]> "GraphenOS Fastboot"
13:41:53 <overheadscallop[> don't do anything
13:42:01 <tvg[m]> Okay

13:49:12 <LinusSexTips[m]2> oof
13:49:28 <LinusSexTips[m]2> I followed a youtube video and it took me maybe 20min lol
14:28:56 <dazinism> chaology: RiotElement  can definately get the latest orbot apk from https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot
14:29:09 <dazinism> And  to verify  https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Verifying_apk_files_and_apps
14:31:39 <dazinism> The github, Play & Guardian Project Fdroid repo versions are all signed with the same keys
14:52:55 <g65434-2[m]> I wouldnt advise using element app on android (at least from fdroid repo)
14:53:24 <g65434-2[m]> it gets slower and slower overtime until it freezes so you need to kill the app and launch it again
14:53:37 <g65434-2[m]> use riot.im app in the meantime
14:59:46 <rridley[m]> yeah riotx/element have been great so far
15:02:30 <LinusSexTips[m]2> I have had the same experience with Element, it eventually freezes until you need to kill it
15:03:50 <joeri_poeri[m]> interesting. I haven't experienced that at all g65434-2
15:23:37 <dazinism> Yeah element starts to lag heavy then freezes for me also.
15:24:09 <dazinism> Think it may depend on how many rooms and how many other people in those rooms?
15:25:26 <dazinism> I mainly use minivector from Fdroid - riot.im with analytics and stuff stripped out (also no calls)
15:27:08 <dazinism> Sometimes it gets stuck on start screen when you reopen app though
15:27:21 <dazinism> Which can also be annoying.
15:27:48 <dazinism> Been meaning to try fluffy chat. They got their own Fdroid repo
15:28:23 <dazinism> https://fluffychat.im/
15:30:39 <dazinism> No end to end encryption yet though, but maybe good for public rooms
15:31:52 <Wonderfall[m]> Tried it, but ditched it since there's an annoying message about missing Play Services every single time the app starts, at a terrible spot for at least a few seconds.
15:33:12 <dazinism> I could handle that better than the app locking up just when you are in the middle of a quick fire conversation. Can be really annoying
15:34:05 <dallemon[m]> dazinism: i tried fluffychat recently. not quite ready for usage, it bugs when trying to authenticate from a different client.
15:34:37 <dazinism> Sometimes i leave Riot.im / minivector to fetch a link to share and when I switch back it instantly dies then gets stuck on the startup screen for a very long time
15:35:46 <dazinism> dallemon: guess if end to end encryption isnt finished there is no point in authenticating?
15:36:27 <dallemon[m]> Well it did show a prompt with emoji, just only 1 repeated several times
15:36:31 <dazinism> Going from what it says on the readme on github, dont know the state of development
15:38:54 <BalooRJ> Has there been any thought to adding some of the FLOSS projecs that are viewed as more essential to operation of a phone into GrapheneOS, or is it simply going to be more of a Pure AOSP experience allowing individual users to get the apps themselves
15:39:29 <BalooRJ> Just asking since the removal of the busted email app, as well as the fact that the Calendar app is also unusable because Google wants to make sure you get that GSM license and use their apps. And with Daniel now calling for a replacement for the Gallery app as well
15:40:18 <BalooRJ> Will we see the likes of K9-Mail, Konele, Flite TTS, Simple Calendar, Silence, etc included in a default install of GrapheneOS?
15:41:21 <dallemon[m]> BalooRJ: There is a issue regarding making a GrapheneOS app store. But it is still far off as no one is working on it, too busy with the current things.
15:41:52 <overheadscallop[> BalooRJ: check the log, Etar and some other apps use an incompatible license https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200723#c4477212
15:42:06 <overheadscallop[> so they can't be preinstalled
15:42:10 <dallemon[m]> <BalooRJ "Will we see the likes of K9-Mail"> I doubt it. However you can roll your own builds with whatever you like.
15:42:15 <overheadscallop[> but they can be distributed through a first-party app store
15:42:39 <BalooRJ> I see, so basically the GPLv3 license bars them from being included with the project overall
15:42:43 <prisonplanet[m]> Defaut program to be included in GrapheneOS : F-Droid, Simple Calendar, Simple Gallery, K9Mail, Signal, Osmand, Open Camera, VLC, Bromite
15:43:36 <BalooRJ> dallemon: I don't mind using the F-Droid store, was just thinking in the context of maybe a more inexperienced user who doesn't know exactly which apps to get

15:44:44 -SEdbot[m]- yes, there's a lot to be done to make GOS easier for people to use
15:44:56 <BalooRJ> makes sense that Daniel from a security perspective would want to be able to have a hardware manufacturer be allowed to lock the bootloader on a GrapheneOS device
15:46:32 <BalooRJ> Thanks for the info all
15:46:44 <BalooRJ> prisonplanet: Think I have almost every single one of those apps on my GrapheneOS phone, heh
15:49:37 <prisonplanet[m]> Binary Eye, NotePad (on Fdroid), Element (Riot), GPSTest, KeepassDX, Scrambled Exif, Unit Converter, Your Local Weather (formidable widget)
15:49:40 <prisonplanet[m]> Etc etc
15:50:44 <BalooRJ> I remember there being an issue with Your Local Weather during one of the previous updates with GrapheneOS and I deleted it, wonder if it got fixed
15:51:05 <BalooRJ> F-Droid has gotten just so much more expansive than even a few years ago
15:51:39 <prisonplanet[m]> İt work perfeclty (i set refresh rate every 6h, no battery consumption at all)
15:51:56 <BalooRJ> I'll have to try it again
15:52:09 <dazinism> BalooRJ: a few of the apps you mentioned arent getting updates any more which is problematic. Apps need to be updated for security issues and to target the latest SDK
15:52:38 <dazinism> ...make use of the new security and privacy features being introduced to AOSP
15:52:51 <dazinism> See https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps for a load of info about apps
15:53:05 <BalooRJ> Yeah, I think the main one not getting updates is Flite TTS but I haven't found an alternative for a FLOSS TTS.
15:53:32 <BalooRJ> Silence as well has shaky development. Though I haven't used it in a while since it is not compatible with KDE Connect's SMS feature.
15:53:38 <BalooRJ> thanks for that link dazinism
15:55:19 <dazinism> Daniel also doesnt like the 'Simple' family of apps.
15:55:52 <dazinism> eg. The file manager giving the impression it can restrict access to files
15:56:00 <dazinism> When it cant really
15:56:44 <prisonplanet[m]> <dazinism "Daniel also doesnt like the 'Sim"> İ use Simple Gallery which is very good and beautiful.opensource app
15:56:52 <prisonplanet[m]> Any better gallery app recommanded ?
15:57:13 <dazinism> I mainly use the built in one
15:57:16 <cdesai> Not open source sadly but Google's gallery go is super nice
15:57:31 <dazinism> For security the best bet is to use the built in apps
15:57:54 <dazinism> Unless they are broken for the way you use them
15:57:58 <dazinism> Works ok for me
15:58:43 <BalooRJ> yeah the built in gallery I havent had a problem with so far, but apparently there is a glitch that causes it to freeze requiring a replacement
15:58:49 <dazinism> Have to open gallery app then images from there to edit them. Rather than from another app via gallery
15:59:18 <BalooRJ> There was another very good one called Camera Roll on F-Droid but I believed that was discontinued
15:59:23 <BalooRJ> there is also Leafpic I think it was called

16:03:48 <thufie[m]> I'm running flash-all.sh on Linux for the Pixel 3a and fastboot appears to hang indefinitely on the flash bootloader command, but every other command in the flash-all script works, meaning that the phone now has everything but the updated bootloader. Is it safe to boot into GrapheneOS and then run a system OTA update to resolve this, or should I wait to resolve the issue flashing the newer bootloader?

16:18:28 <pikey[m]> Sorry thufie, didn't scroll down before posting.
16:19:17 <pikey[m]> and I am not qualified to answer but I would try the OTA update and use Attestation.app/Auditor, if something ain't right it should report

16:20:22 <pikey[m]> <prisonplanet[m] "Any better gallery app recommand"> I have yet to find anything better than simple gallery, its very nice. I have their calculator and flashlight too, great stuff
16:20:28 <pikey[m]> <thufie[m] "nevermind it seems that most of "> great :)
16:20:56 <pikey[m]> nearly every problem i had was down to bad cable. eventually i took the hint and bought a high quality cable and stopped buying cheap junk, all went smoothly after that!
16:23:20 <thufie[m]> I was using the stock cable its just my laptop's usb ports are all cruddy I guess.
16:23:55 <thufie[m]> I've got that sweet GrapheneOS boot screen on my girlfriend's phone now though, so it worked!

17:39:30 <pikey[m]> <brenneke[m] "How about using Disappearing mes"> Don't think that's a good workaround. I use it, but also wish I could stop it restoring chats
17:42:01 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: what do you mean restoring
17:42:02 <brenneke[m]> But if they are disappeared than they can't restore right?
17:42:05 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: just don't use backups?
17:42:24 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: not really sure what you mean
17:42:39 <strcat[m]> the local encrypted backup feature uses a strong key
17:42:40 <strcat[m]> not a pin
17:43:12 <brenneke[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: just don't use ba"> You are right, just looked and there is a toggle for that.

17:45:47 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <ura[m] "insular aint on there either"> Oh, didn't know. User profiles are more robust and recommended way of isolating apps.
17:46:05 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> But it still depends on user-case (esp. if you need notifs for multiple accounts)
17:47:56 <rover1[m]> or want convenience, reboot device after profile switch not most convenient

18:22:12 <tencarsb[m]> I am curious...
18:22:20 <cn3m[m]> First Qubes doesn't have verified boot. A compromise is permanent. Verified Boot + Remote attestation(this is important) will do very well on GrapheneOS
18:22:29 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has far fewer trusted parties
18:23:00 <cn3m[m]> You trust Daniel building it on an offline machine and signing it. The only person with access to the final product
18:23:05 <tencarsb[m]> Are those chips in the pixels open as in source?
18:23:29 <cn3m[m]> Qubes you trust everyone in the Fedora and Qubes repos which is a lot
18:23:50 <sikisoki[m]> <cn3m[m] "First Qubes doesn't have verifie"> Isn't verified boot only for physical attacks and not remote?
18:23:51 <RiotElement[m]> <cn3m[m] "You trust Daniel building it on "> But then again Graphene OS also has a lot less fewer eyes reviewing it than Linux, no?
18:23:59 <cn3m[m]> Qubes also has very insecure guests(Desktop Linux is pretty terrible for security)
18:24:11 <RiotElement[m]> * > <@cn3m:privacytools.io> You trust Daniel building it on an offline machine and signing it. The only person with access to the final product
18:24:11 <RiotElement[m]> But then again Graphene OS also has a lot less fewer eyes reviewing it than Linux, no? (Linux has thousands of devs in its community)
18:24:18 <cn3m[m]> <sikisoki[m] "Isn't verified boot only for phy"> no it is far more important for remote. If you get hacked the system rolls back
18:24:36 <cn3m[m]> <RiotElement[m] "But then again Graphene OS also "> GrapheneOS is a very light patchset that is not changing AOSP really
18:24:40 <sikisoki[m]> <cn3m[m] "You trust Daniel building it on "> This is NOT an attack on Daniel. But is there ANY way to prove the code running on my device is the same he posted on GitHub?
18:24:45 <cn3m[m]> it is essentially all additive on top
18:25:09 <cn3m[m]> <sikisoki[m] "This is NOT an attack on Daniel."> Yes, built it yourself he makes everything open source. Even the attestation server
18:25:22 <justchill[m]> <cn3m[m] "First Qubes doesn't have verifie"> I'm not an expert so I'm not sure of the difference between the Verified boot and the Attestation done using HOTP in a Qubes + Heads installation. How is the former more secure?
18:25:31 <cn3m[m]> or just trust him since he has stared down the military going after the keys before
18:26:17 <sikisoki[m]> <cn3m[m] "or just trust him since he has s"> What? Please explain
18:26:32 <cn3m[m]> <justchill[m] "I'm not an expert so I'm not sur"> Verified boot on GrapheneOS is built from the ground with hardware and software working together. It is one of the best setups. Heads is not even close Qubes isn't designed for it either
18:27:14 <cn3m[m]> <sikisoki[m] "What? Please explain"> CopperheadOS? The company sponsoring Daniel for a while tried to force him to turn over keys to the military for "auditing"
18:27:44 <cn3m[m]> Daniel left and the project was renamed GrapheneOS
18:27:56 <cn3m[m]> CopperheadOS as we know it is dead, and a scammer is hanging onto the name
18:28:39 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "GrapheneOS is a very light patch"> Does this refer to its current state or future plans too? Assuming current development is about getting back to a certain standard before Copperhead died, it's still in the future plans to completely rework some elements of AOSP isn't it?
18:29:14 <cn3m[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Does this refer to its current s"> From my understanding the goal is to stay pretty modular
18:29:32 <cn3m[m]> makes development easier and less issues arise
18:29:33 <cn3m[m]> the project adds a ton for security
18:29:38 <cn3m[m]> without giving up much
18:30:14 <cn3m[m]> the patchsets for linux-hardened and even the hardened_malloc "just work" on regular linux too
18:30:18 <cn3m[m]> that is the goal
18:31:01 <tencarsb[m]> cn3m: you are so knowledgeable, are you a dev in the graphene is project? Excuse my personal question...
18:31:07 <cn3m[m]> Qubes is a cool research project, but it is definitely not as secure as a Pixel
18:31:09 <cn3m[m]> or an iPhone
18:31:31 <TheJollyRoger> justchill[m]: With respect to Verified boot, there's a big difference:
18:31:37 <justchill[m]> <cn3m[m] "Verified boot on GrapheneOS is b"> I've read this from experts before. I'm interested in why though. What points in particular would you say are the biggest differences from a security perspective? If the answer's too long to post here, could you point me at appropriate references?
18:31:46 <cn3m[m]> <tencarsb[m] "cn3m: you are so knowledgeable, "> I am not, I just read a lot of research papers and have a background in breaking stuff(working in ad tech). Mobile is my specialty.
18:31:51 <cn3m[m]> I like tinkering
18:32:05 <tencarsb[m]> Ok
18:32:37 <TheJollyRoger> Android Verified Boot uses the late stage Qualcomm bootloader (which, tada, is actually open source!) to ensure that the entire system image, kernel, system partition, all the privileged components of the operating system (all of them!) are bitwise identical and valid to the keys that signed them, which only your developers should own.
18:32:43 <TheJollyRoger> It does this every time the operating system boots.
18:32:47 <sikisoki[m]> <cn3m[m] "CopperheadOS? The company sponso"> I have read about the story, but never seen anyone mention the military.
18:32:51 <cn3m[m]> <justchill[m] "I've read this from experts befo"> Yeah, Apple did a great talk on this actually. Behind iOS and MacOS security at BlackHat 2019. They talk about the differences in secure boot, T2 chip verified boot on macOS, and iOS verified boot. It is a decent primer
18:33:27 <cn3m[m]> Apple is extremely good and trustworthy on verified boot
18:33:45 <cn3m[m]> they even made their own secure by design filesystem to better support it
18:34:18 <TheJollyRoger> justchill[m]: Every time your Pixel 2 or a later reboots, what it will be doing is verifying the entire system image, to that digital signature, with the key set in the bootloader. If the signature doesn't match, then the bootloader will use parity blocks to try to revert the damage until it will.
18:34:30 <cn3m[m]> Their research is excellent and Krstic is very knowledgeable
18:35:28 <cn3m[m]> The breakdown between the current implementations on Windows and Linux vs how macOS does it are great. However do keep in mind Microsoft has the Secured Core PCs which are slightly better than the macOS verified boot. The video is a year old
18:35:35 <cn3m[m]> still a good primer
18:35:36 <TheJollyRoger> This essentially removes persistence from the system partition and means that should someone find an exploit for your phone, root the operating system, and modify your system partition, as soon as you reboot the phone, those modifications will either A) be undone, or B) your phone will catch it, warn you that something's not right, and stop you from using an operating system that's been
18:35:38 <TheJollyRoger> modified beyond repair.
18:36:59 <cn3m[m]> The thing to keep in mind with Android Verified Boot is if someone can get full access they can install accessibility services or device managers for effective spyware. Remote attestation with Auditor is effective at catching this
18:37:03 <cn3m[m]> Use Auditor
18:37:11 <cn3m[m]> use remote attestation
18:37:13 <cn3m[m]> there is no reason not too
18:37:24 <cn3m[m]> it is wonderful and my favorite GrapheneOS project
18:37:30 <cn3m[m]> hands down
18:38:08 <TheJollyRoger> Pixel 3s and later (3a, 4 et al) utilize the hardware security module for doing this, which is a huge reduction of the attack surface with specially created hardware and presents less attack surface than the previous generation of devices, which just used a commercial off the shelf NXP smartcard chip.
18:38:14 <cn3m[m]> Auditor is wonderful even without GrapheneOS
18:39:46 <cn3m[m]> In general nothing will come close to GrapheneOS or iOS on PC. If you want something close you can do what I do and use a Pixel and an iPad(if you get a good setup it can do most of what a PC can for me)
18:40:10 <justchill[m]> <cn3m[m] "Yeah, Apple did a great talk on "> Thanks. I've found the relevant video on youtube. I'll definitely check it out!
18:40:10 <cn3m[m]> but yeah definitely trust your GrapheneOS Pixel over your PC
18:40:23 <cn3m[m]> x86 is not robust for verified boot
18:40:55 <TheJollyRoger> What cn3m[m]  said. Even if we had some way to verify the boot partition, and even if we assume that this way of verifying the boot partition is secure and perfectly trustworthy...
18:41:00 * TheJollyRoger gives a bleak little laugh at that.
18:41:08 <cn3m[m]> definitely not paired with Linux Desktops
18:41:31 <TheJollyRoger> ...the issue is that the chain of trust ends there because there's no further way to verify the system partition.
18:42:11 <hypokeimenon[m]> Will the shift to Arm help macOS I  terms of verified boot
18:42:22 <cn3m[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Will the shift to Arm help macOS"> 110%
18:42:35 <cn3m[m]> Apple Silicon will have a better solution than Windows Secured Core PCs and less attack surface for sure
18:43:18 <TheJollyRoger> Simply slapping on Full Disk Encryption doesn't change that fact either, because even if you were to use an authenticated mode of encryption to prevent offline tampering, it doesn't end up being as robust as verified boot anyways because there's still no signature validation on the system partition anyways.
18:43:31 <justchill[m]> <cn3m[m] "The thing to keep in mind with A"> From my understanding, you need 2 android phones to use Auditor though. Also, wouldn't verified boot catch this? Or do you mean someone installing a different OS altogether and adding a different verified boot while they had physical access to the device?
18:43:53 <hypokeimenon[m]> <cn3m[m] "definitely not paired with Linux"> What about ChromeOS? Is it still the case that those random Mediatek chip Chromebooks are a better idea than a modern Pixelbook Go?
18:43:59 <cn3m[m]> <justchill[m] "From my understanding, you need "> no verified boot doesn't check for accessibility
18:44:16 <TheJollyRoger> justchill[m]: If you don't have a second Android phone, you can use the GrapheneOS attestation server. You'll be trusting TLS, and the attestation server, and the device you use to display the audit data, but that's preferable to no attestation at all.
18:44:53 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <cn3m[m] "no verified boot doesn't check f"> On a tangential note, will rebooting to Safe Mode help in undoing and removing the said accessibility/device admin app?
18:44:53 <cn3m[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "What about ChromeOS? Is it still"> ChromeOS is too locked down. iPad makes way more sense for a secure locked down device

18:49:51 <dazinism> Need to sort that out, link one to the other, so dont need to update both.

18:57:58 <RiotElement[m]> Are Aurora apps any less secure/private than their F-Droid counterparts?
18:58:48 <cn3m[m]> <RiotElement[m] "Are Aurora apps any less secure/"> they are technically more secure
18:58:53 <justchill[m]> <RiotElement[m] "Are Aurora apps any less secure/"> Aurora is from my understanding just a way to install stuff available from the play store
18:59:08 <TheJollyRoger> F-Droid acts as a trusted third party.
18:59:15 <cn3m[m]> for two reasons v2/v3 signing and distributed signing
18:59:20 <cn3m[m]> apps are sandboxed
18:59:25 <cn3m[m]> they don't need to share keys
18:59:37 <cn3m[m]> it is actually bad
18:59:40 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid security is a downgrade
18:59:42 <RiotElement[m]> <cn3m[m] "they are technically more secure"> Which one are you referring to by “they”?
18:59:54 <cn3m[m]> Auror a
19:00:24 <RiotElement[m]> <cn3m[m] "F-Droid security is a downgrade "> Gotcha, never mind
19:01:02 <cn3m[m]> Ideally for security you would use Google Play Store, but not compatible
19:01:19 <TheJollyRoger> Many of the apps on F-Droid as well end up lagging significantly behind upstream, and end up missing security patches. Not only that, but unless the app is built reproducibly /and/ uses the developer's signature, it's going to be signed with the F-Droid release keys, which are common to all the apps that F-Droid releases.
19:01:23 <RiotElement[m]> Do you guys recommend any way to use swipe on keyboard?
19:01:24 <cn3m[m]> the auto updates, the distributed trust, and much higher security standard help a lot
19:01:44 <TheJollyRoger> On Distributed trust: the Android Security Model assumes that each app will be signed with its own developer's keys.
19:02:16 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Many of the apps on F-Droid as w"> yeah you trust the devs to make the app you should trust them to build and sign them. Adding another party is questionable at best
19:02:23 <TheJollyRoger> In miniature: let's assume that Tom develops iChat, Dick develops MessageNow, and Harry develops the FacePage app.
19:02:33 <SchismXL[m]> <RiotElement[m] "Do you guys recommend any way to"> Any one of them. Just block network access.
19:02:36 <cn3m[m]> <RiotElement[m] "Do you guys recommend any way to"> Gboard is good
19:03:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
19:03:19 <cn3m[m]> <SchismXL[m] "Any one of them. Just block netw"> If you distrust the app that much that might not be a good solution
19:03:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've been told gboard is the best
19:03:21 <TheJollyRoger> Since Android will pin the certificates and assume that they won't change for the lifetime of the app, if you install iChat, MessageNow, and FacePage, this means that they'll trust Tom, Dick, and Harry's keys for only their respective apps on first contact.
19:03:42 <TheJollyRoger> So Tom can push updates for iChat, Dick can push updates for MessageNow, and Harry can push updates for FacePage.
19:03:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: keys can change
19:04:03 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: yeah?
19:04:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Apk signature v3 allows you to change signing keys
19:04:13 <cn3m[m]> he is talking about F-Droid but ofc
19:04:30 <TheJollyRoger> But Tom can't push updates for MessageNow or FacePage without compromising /both/ Dick and Harry's keys.
19:04:36 <SchismXL[m]> <cn3m[m] "If you distrust the app that muc"> True, but the option is there.
19:04:46 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: ah I see.
19:04:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Older schemes require you to sign with all the keys
19:04:57 <cn3m[m]> <SchismXL[m] "True, but the option is there."> network permission is not robust enough if you fully distrust an app
19:05:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "But Tom can't push updates for M"> s/both/either
19:05:17 -SEdbot[m]- > <@freenode_TheJollyRoger:matrix.org> But Tom can't push updates for MessageNow or FacePage without compromising /both/ Dick and Harry's keys.
19:05:17 -SEdbot[m]- But Tom can't push updates for MessageNow or FacePage without compromising /either / Dick and Harry's keys.
19:05:59 <cn3m[m]> F-Droid undermines the Android security model in so many ways
19:06:09 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, lemme reword that: Tom can't push updates for both Messagenow and Facepage without compromising both Dick and Harry's Keys.
19:06:14 <TheJollyRoger> Handy bot.
19:06:25 <cn3m[m]> the whole point of sandboxing is other apps are fully seperated. If F-Droid is compromised and you use it a lot you are toast
19:07:10 <cn3m[m]> it is a single point of failure(which is good when that is an OS that is privileged) bad for deprivileged things like apps
19:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Since F-Droid bypasses Tom, Dick, and Harry at the same time and just serves their own build.
19:07:20 <minz3[m]> Do you compare F-Droid wirh aurora droid or with aurora store ?
19:07:23 <justchill[m]> <cn3m[m] "yeah you trust the devs to make "> I read in the linked wiki that Google has recently been asking devs to upload the signing keys and let Google sign on their behalf. Doesn't this add an extra required level of trust?

19:08:11 <cn3m[m]> <justchill[m] "I read in the linked wiki that G"> yes, but you trust Google to build AOSP
19:08:13 <TheJollyRoger> justchill[m]: Not really. Individual developers can still choose to take charge of their own apps.
19:08:19 <cn3m[m]> they are part of the trust model of your OS to some degree
19:08:26 <cn3m[m]> <TheJollyRoger "justchill: Not really. Individua"> soon not anymore iirc
19:08:36 <TheJollyRoger> Aw that's a pity.
