00:52:16 <subzero> Hello.. Looking for someone that maybe can assist me with some issues im having with my pixel 3a.
00:52:30 <cUmUc> subzero: wazzup
00:55:03 <subzero> Ive had this phone for 2 months, never had any issues with except for now. Ive had the phone turned off for 3 weeks, and today i noticed that half of the apps are not working (those from aurora) like Wickr, Spotify, Livescore etc.
00:57:28 <cUmUc> shiggg
00:57:37 <cUmUc> did u try reinstalling them?
00:58:39 <subzero> I tried deleting aurora store and download it again, but it doesnt work. Nothing happens when i click on "anonym" and i cant sign on to a google account either.
00:59:09 <cUmUc> snap
00:59:25 <cUmUc> thats working for me maybe if u login with a google account it mite work
00:59:43 <cUmUc> i had an issue where slack stopped working upgrading from android 10 to 11
00:59:51 <cUmUc> and reinstalling it fixed it
01:00:01 <cUmUc> after completely removing the app
01:00:29 <cUmUc> idk if that'll fix it in your case but its worth a shot
01:01:02 <subzero> I Can't login with a google account. I tried that, i just get a popup blank white page on the phone and nothing loads up.
01:01:20 <cUmUc> big oof
01:01:26 <cUmUc> whats ur aurora store version?
01:11:18 <subzero> the latest one.
01:18:13 <goblinslayer[m]> > Hello.. Looking for someone that maybe can assist me with some issues im having with my pixel 3a.
01:18:13 <goblinslayer[m]> I'm having issues with apps not being able to use the camera at all since 11 updaye
01:20:10 <subzero> Other issues; Cant even do searches using vanadium. Whatever i search for i get the following message;
01:20:43 <subzero> "the connection is not privateAn attacker could try to steal your data from duckduckgo.com"
01:21:47 <strcat[m]> subzero: sounds either your time is set wrong or you're on a compromised network
01:22:19 <strcat[m]> subzero: your apps / OS aren't broken, they're protecting you from compromise
01:22:41 <subzero> Yeah i was just about to write that, on the pixel im 20 minutes behind lol.
01:22:48 <strcat[m]> perhaps you're on a network that performs TLS interception and expects you to install their root CA locally (most apps still won't work)
01:23:00 <strcat[m]> subzero: not 20 minutes behind - what date is it set to?
01:23:13 <strcat[m]> it sounds like the time may be completely wrong
01:23:39 <subzero> 2nd october 02:03
01:28:21 <subzero> Omg, everything works now. Thank you guys!
01:30:34 <renlord> did the time update
01:30:40 <renlord> *synchronize?
01:32:09 <subzero> I changed the time and date manually, everything started working then. Spotify/aurora store wickr etc.
01:32:46 <renlord> subzero: did you turn off time synchronization?
01:33:03 <renlord> specifically, the network time update option in settings
01:35:01 <HeXiLeD> any plans to support Google Pixel 4a (5G) and Google Pixel 5 ?
01:35:49 <subzero> Where do i find it? I turned off "use networks time" in Settings > System > Date and Time.
01:36:00 <subzero> I have diffrent language so i have to translate everything lol
01:37:03 <louipc> HeXiLeD: need volunteer maintainers
01:37:17 <renlord> subzero: ok, you turned it off.
01:37:36 <renlord> just curious
01:42:25 <HeXiLeD> although this defeats the purpose of using graphene, if the user needs to install google services due to some needed apps with those dependencies, can google apps be installed? If so, can they be installed at any time or prior to any other apps being installed on the phone (like LineageOS)
01:43:42 <louipcm> you cant install google services on grapheneos
01:44:16 <HeXiLeD> alrighty :)
01:47:23 <takhar[m]> Is there anyway to tell offhand what apps use Google play services? Other than asking the devs or osint?
01:50:30 <louipcm> some apps fallback to another service or behaviour if they don't have google services, so just using them doesn't mean they won't work. I guess you could analyse the apk for api calls tho
01:52:32 <ss132ikl> i keep getting this error when running `script/release.sh sunfish`:
01:52:33 * ss132ikl sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YtGyokoOjOCpxhczHzSkdBNb/message.txt >
01:52:46 <ss132ikl> the `target_files_intermediates` dir doesn't exist
01:53:02 <takhar[m]> <louipcm "some apps fallback to another se"> Thanks. I wonder if you can force that behavior by default.
02:01:47 <renlord> HeXiLeD: some mocked api providers can be installed
02:02:06 <renlord> and will allow you to use certain google apps, specifically the gcam app
02:05:33 <takhar[m]> <renlord "and will allow you to use certai"> Is that on an app by app basis? For example, if I am installing an app from f Droid, does it come with the mocked apis or would I have to install it seperately?
02:06:08 <renlord> takhar[m]: separate and it most certainly does not get distributed in the app store
02:09:03 <takhar[m]> <renlord "takhar: separate and it most cer"> Gracias. I assumed that f Droid apks were designed not to rely on GPS, but that was my first mistake.
02:11:48 <the5000[m]> What are the best apps to have with graphene
02:18:51 <renlord> the5000[m]: that almost always depends on individual user preferences
02:19:01 <renlord> and nobody can provide the best advice on what are the best apps to have
02:19:29 <renlord> the best apps to have already come bundled with the OS distribution
02:19:40 <renlord> i.e. Auditor, Vanadium
02:39:44 <ss132ikl> i'm currently getting
02:39:44 <ss132ikl> `emulator: ERROR: Can't get kernel version from the kernel image file: '/mnt/HDD/grapheneos-RP1A.201105.002.2020.11.05.18/prebuilts/qemu-kernel/arm64/ranchu/kernel-qemu'` when trying to run `emulator`
05:14:34 <COVID-1984> Awesome, chromium improved its built-in darkmode via chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark - just enabled in vanadium
05:15:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys we need more people to help against the misinformation being spread against graphene
05:16:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> James and copperhead spread most of it, along with a few people who were misled by them
05:16:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you can help, please pm me
05:18:26 <COVID-1984> anupritaisno1[m]: why not share the strategy here? So far it seems Daniel has taken a pretty open approach, which seems to work best imo
05:19:28 <COVID-1984> Just repeat all of your oppositions strongest points + your replies in a easily found place. Then everyone who wants to be deluded only has themselves to blame.
05:51:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> COVID-1984: a separate group really is required for this
05:51:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't assume to know stuff
06:09:02 <COVID-1984> I'm not assuming to know anything except general war strategy.
06:10:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> COVID-1984: we are not going to war btw
06:11:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> We are also not attacking people, we attack their misinformation by stating the facts and backing those up with evidence
06:12:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> COVID-1984: if you want to help you can pm me through IRC
06:14:02 <COVID-1984> Right, I didn't imply that. Feel free to PM me as well, but I was just stating that I don't think it is the correct strategy. Most war is via information, btw.
06:14:36 <somenerd[m]> >  a separate group really is required for this
06:14:36 <somenerd[m]> This could help
06:14:57 <COVID-1984> how about #grapheneos-offtopic ?
06:15:26 <somenerd[m]> no, not really
06:15:48 <somenerd[m]> a third one would be better mostly because people come here for help
06:16:06 <somenerd[m]> and #grapheneos-offtopic is for other discussion
06:16:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> COVID-1984: I have sent you an invite
06:17:57 <COVID-1984> Maybe I don't have weechat setup right yet, but I don't see anything
06:18:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah probably just get a matrix account
08:16:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Guys we need more people to help"> Guys
08:16:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me
08:52:57 <dazinism> the5000: check out https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
10:45:29 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1194
10:45:33 <strcat[m]> looks like this will be fixed soon
10:45:42 <strcat[m]> it just hasn't been deployed on matrix.org yet
11:18:55 <madd_hatter[m]> anupritaisno1: strcat may seem minor to sine but that is significant for me.  There are plenty of groups I am wanting to actively glean info and learn but have no reason to actively post.
11:18:55 <madd_hatter[m]> Be interesting to see how they implement it.
11:18:55 <madd_hatter[m]> Thanks for the uodate.
14:52:01 <srinivasmetta200> hey
14:57:01 <nscnt> srinivasmetta200: Hello
15:02:17 <srinivasmetta200> why did you choose element over telegram??
15:06:47 <ruddo[m]> Every part of the Matrix network is open source, and Matrix is decentralized / federated.
15:06:53 <ruddo[m]> That is my guess.
15:11:37 <nscnt> I don't think there was a decision *over* something. Matrix bridges freenode channels. Matrix is more accessible than IRC, so GrapheneOS chose to list Matrix next to IRC
15:13:33 <nscnt> strcat also mentioned[1] he's looking into bridges with other platforms like Telegram to make it more accessible than IRC. [1] https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/1194
15:15:20 <nscnt> ... as an addition, I guess (since a change for the mentioned issue will be incorporated in Matrix.org)
15:21:52 <nscnt> not as a replacement
15:25:02 <srinivasmetta200> Recently an Indian mobile company by the name of Micromax launched it's first stock android phone, could you look into it, and tell if it has any potential for being official graphene OS phone.
15:32:03 <indianajonestheo> Could someone help me i flashed grapheneos today, all is working but as i'm really tired i put a password and i forgot it :( Just would like to reset
15:33:05 <indianajonestheo> i know it's stupid
15:35:23 <indianajonestheo> Please
15:39:57 <indianajonestheo> i'm on pixel 4a
15:43:05 <ruddo[m]> You must unlock OEM, reflash, relock OEM.
15:43:21 <ruddo[m]> Never set a passphrase before writing it down somewhere appropriate.
15:43:51 <ruddo[m]> Actually just unlock and relock, erases your data and passphrase.
15:47:32 <indianajonestheo> the problem is i can't:( I followed the grapheneos installation guide so i disabled in settings this option :(
15:49:39 <indianajonestheo> i can't,  i disable oem unlocking in settings :( 😭
15:49:51 <indianajonestheo>  * i can't,  i disabled oem unlocking in settings :( 😭
15:52:27 <ruddo[m]> Ah.  I am so sorry then.  Your phone is now hazardous waste.  That is by design in the Android OS, to prevent theft of phones being profitable.
15:56:01 <indianajonestheo> 😔😭 i will try to remember so. Thanks for trying to help me

16:06:39 <Lia[m]> (Power button + up button)
16:07:45 <Lia[m]> I kinda don't understand those comments earlier when it is completely possible to do factory reset at recovery mode

16:18:28 <makingaliasesisa> I hadn't had a phone for like 2 months and it wouldn't boot into grapheneOS and wouldn't boot into calyx after i had it say no Operating Systems were found on the devices storage. :/
16:18:56 <makingaliasesisa> luckily i got it to work
16:43:54 <ruddo[m]> Phew.  Good to know.
17:05:53 <sanskk> Hello.
17:05:54 <sanskk> Is Google Camera still working with GrapheneOS?
17:08:42 <pallaf[m]> I tried to sideload gcamp via adb but I could't find it on my device
17:09:02 <pallaf[m]> Looks like it wasn't installed
17:09:18 <dazinism> sanskk: currently it is possible to get it working. You need another app to fake an API that gcam looks for.
17:09:44 <pallaf[m]> dazinism what app would it be?
17:10:15 <dazinism> https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider
17:10:21 <TheJollyRoger> srinivasmetta200: In order for any device to be considered for being officially supported by GrapheneOS, it must have a re-keyable bootloader with full bootloader security features available to non-vendor operating systems, offer firmware and hardware security properties equivalent to Pixels, long term vendor support and a reputation of being diligent about firmware updates, and also there must
17:10:22 <TheJollyRoger> be a volunteer maintainer available for it who is able to commit to supporting the phone for the expected lifetime of the device. That's the barest minimum; if the answer to those is "no" or "maybe?" then it can't be considered.
17:10:42 <sanskk> dazinism: I tried that, but it didn't work. The camera application didn't really start up, tried it with 8.1 and 7.6.
17:11:39 <dazinism> Not sure which version you need, may depend on the phone?
17:12:15 <dazinism> apkmirror is a pretty safe place to get different versions.
17:12:29 <sanskk> It's a Pixel 4 XL.
17:38:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> sanskk: please send me logs
17:46:24 <sanskk> anupritaisno1: 7.5 nodpi version works.
17:50:21 <sanskk> 8.1 versions don't work at all.
17:56:59 <sanskk> 7.6 doesn't work either.
17:57:11 <sanskk> So it will be 7.5 nodpi.
19:39:20 <mx[m]> hi,
19:39:21 <mx[m]> I connect usb ethernet adapter to my pixel 3a and it is greyed out/not working. Did anyone try to use and share network connection?
19:40:53 <mx[m]> there is no hardware issue as it is working on my laptop
20:12:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wtf
20:12:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway
20:12:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need people who can help us against the misinformation being spread against graphene
20:12:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> The misinformation is mostly being spread by james and copperhead
20:13:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are also several people who have been misled or manipulated by james
20:13:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me if you want to help
20:23:42 <nfpdex[m]> how is it possible to help, if you have no connection to the whole situation or knowledge? I know of course how Daniel Micay has described all of it and I totally believe him, but what are we supposed to do?
20:26:08 <nfpdex[m]> and total noob question: Does anyone know what Daniel thinks of Chrome/ChromiumOS? If Android is so secure and it is choosen as the best available platform to develop graphene, would Chromium then not be the most suitable thing to build a secure desktop OS with?
20:31:03 <strcat[m]> there's a #grapheneos-offtopic channel
20:31:08 <strcat[m]> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org for Matrix
20:31:39 <strcat[m]> but in general, asking for a specific developer's views is not appropriate
20:32:10 <strcat[m]> these are public channels, you shouldn't be requesting a specific person's opinion
20:34:22 <strcat[m]> if people want to help they should get in touch with anupritaisno1, stop energy discouraging people from helping is not needed
20:34:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> nfpdex: security on desktop is quite hard to achieve
20:35:02 <strcat[m]> it's off-topic
20:35:06 <strcat[m]> please move the conversation to the offtopic channel
20:35:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Grapheneos is not just secure software, we also need hardware support
20:35:27 <nfpdex[m]> excuse me I forgot about the offtopic channel and I didnt know asking for someones view is not appropriate. thought developers share their opinions here.
20:35:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is why we pick devices like pixels which meet our requirements
20:35:44 <strcat[m]> the developers don't take requests for their opinions
20:35:52 <strcat[m]> you should address questions to the room rather than specific people
20:35:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> In the desktop space there's not quite a lot
20:36:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> And even then we can't tell users to buy a specific desktop really
20:36:20 <strcat[m]> please move the desktop conversation to offtopic
20:36:51 <strcat[m]> it was phrased in a way that it's not relevant to GrapheneOS
20:59:21 <lain_> hi, i'm trying to do a clean setup on a used 3A (sargo) with installing stock image first, but it when I execute "flash-all.sh" script, nothing happens
