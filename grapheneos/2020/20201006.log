00:12:14 <sjekk-igjen> can someone explain simply what upstream and downstream means?
00:12:25 <sjekk-igjen> i hear it referenced on hear all the time
00:12:32 <sjekk-igjen> *here
00:12:56 <renlord[m]> upstream is what the current project is bases its working set on
00:13:26 <renlord[m]> downstream is when other project uses our project for its base working set
00:13:47 <renlord[m]> AOSP is the upstream for Graphene OS
00:14:00 <sjekk-igjen> riiiiight, that makes sense. i must admit i kinda got the idea from context but it is nice to hear it formulated more concretely
00:14:05 <sjekk-igjen> thanks!
00:40:46 <strcat[m]> building kernels with October update now, not many changes
00:44:26 <sjekk-igjen> strcat[m]: cool
01:15:25 <kastel[m]> Is there any way to disable the zoom out effect on wallpapers? For example when I bring the notification shade down, or show recent apps screen, the wallpaper would zoom out
01:17:16 <kastel[m]> Also using the wallpaper picker that comes default, not gallery
01:17:54 <kastel[m]> When I try to set wallpapers, at the bottom is a large black bar no matter the wallpaper, such as the one appearing below the guy in this picture
01:18:11 * kastel[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201005-211629.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KNwBqzMrzmSgxoNSPujqnYjf/Screenshot_20201005-211629.png >
01:18:58 <kastel[m]> Think that might have something to do with the zooming, dunno though but I did try setting height and width individually to same as screen, didn't affect anything
01:59:29 <cornbread0296[m]> Hi. Ive recently installed graphene on my pixel 3axl and the always on display setting dosent seem to be available, any adivce?
01:59:40 <cornbread0296[m]>  * Hi. Ive recently installed graphene on my pixel 3axl and the always on display setting dosent seem to be available, any advice?
02:03:30 <MattVolk[m]> My alarm goes off but doesn't give me option to snooze/end while docked/charging. I have to unlock and snooze from the notification. This started with the Android 11 update. Pixel 4 XL
02:06:07 <sjekk-igjen> Ah yes, I belive this another problem with the included clock app.
02:07:21 <sjekk-igjen> If I understand correctly it is because the developers of Android released a rather rough version with Android 11
02:07:36 <sjekk-igjen> Could be fixed by GrapheneOS devs though
02:10:57 <strcat> cornbread0296[m]: there's an open issue about it
02:11:05 <strcat> cornbread0296[m]: those devices don't have a maintainer
02:11:29 <strcat> someone has to look into the resource overlays used on stock and replicate those things for GrapheneOS
02:14:58 <cornbread0296[m]> Thanks
02:34:31 <kastel[m]> ah, also the bubble feature is missing for messengers I've noticed. tested with stock messaging app.
03:02:02 <strcat> kastel[m]: stock messaging app doesn't have it, doesn't mean it's missing
03:14:17 <kastel[m]> ah, I wasn't aware of how its integrated. thought it would just pop up the entire app in a smaller window or something for apps that send message categorized notifications, to give it global compatibility or something
03:29:19 <kastel[m]> any ideas about the wallpaper problem I mentioned above?
04:14:46 <mastercakex[m]> Bubble feature is fully functional. On Telegram messenu. Others are just too lazy to update their software, let alone drop phone numbers as a mean of registration

11:19:13 <cron732741[m]> can i limit battery charging without root to not charge to 100% or get notification when battery is charged to some point?
11:21:19 <zyxt128[m]> why?
11:21:37 <zyxt128[m]> do you have a damaged battery?
11:21:42 <cron732741[m]> no
11:22:37 <cron732741[m]> from what i know kepping battery at high vltage isnt good so charging to max to (correct me if i am wrong)
11:23:41 <zyxt128[m]> There are some related app for that in playstore, but I'm not sure if you can find them in F-Droid
11:23:56 <zyxt128[m]>  * There are some related apps for that in playstore, but I'm not sure if you can find them in F-Droid
11:24:01 <cron732741[m]> there is some app in fdroid to do that but need root
11:24:32 <zyxt128[m]> That sounds pretty suspicious...
11:25:19 <zyxt128[m]> Does this app limit the battery charging, or is it just monitoring and notifying you? If the later, it's probably a malware
11:26:14 <cron732741[m]> description says that its notifying and limit or slow down charging
11:29:23 <zyxt128[m]> Ok, I guess that it runs a native library in order to limit the charghing (not sure if it can run in GOS, even a rooted phone)
11:30:54 <zyxt128[m]> But on the other hand, if you use the phones charger, charging at 100% will not damage your battery. It is said, that you should not drain your battery in order to extend it's life
11:31:39 <cron732741[m]> drain? when i should plug it %?
11:33:37 <zyxt128[m]> https://www.androidauthority.com/maximize-battery-life-882395/
11:34:31 <zyxt128[m]> 30%-80%
11:35:49 <cron732741[m]> ok but app still will be helpfull
11:36:03 <cron732741[m]> or os build in feature
11:36:11 <strcat> cron732741[m]: the hardware already throttles charging so that it charges much slower as it reaches 100% - and 100% does not mean max rated capacity of the battery from the manufacturer anyway
11:36:22 <strcat> it is built in to the hardware
11:36:31 <strcat> the USB firmware at least
11:37:03 <strcat> charge your phone and notice how quick it'll go from 20% to 90% but it starts getting much slower as it reaches the end
11:37:16 <jalb> Thanks a lot Daniel!!, great update, waiting to receive it :)
11:37:45 <strcat> still in internal testing for now, will go out via Beta channel in a few hours
11:37:59 <cron732741[m]> ok but 20% is about real 20% and nofing will notify to plug smartphone
11:38:20 <ben4r[m]> why can't i use the fingerprint sensor for auto-filling passwords, while using a pattern/code to unlock the phone?
11:39:06 <strcat> ben4r[m]: face scanning has a toggle to disable using it as a secondary unlock method, fingerprint scanning doesn't have a setting in the GUI
11:39:19 <strcat> look in the issue tracker, there's an enhancement issue filed about it
11:39:41 <strcat> why not: because it hasn't been implemented in a satisfactory way for the current OS (same reason all those other planned features aren't there)
11:43:23 <ben4r[m]> really hope it will be possible in the future
11:47:31 <strcat> if someone implements it
11:48:07 <strcat> there's also planned support for adding a PIN to biometric unlock methods for 2-factor secondary unlock instead of just the biometric
11:48:16 <strcat> again requires someone to implement it
11:52:26 <duggalsu[m]> Question : can I contribute to GOS code in any way with 4GB of working memory?
11:52:43 <strcat[m]> sure
11:52:53 <strcat[m]> there are standalone apps to work on
11:53:04 <strcat[m]> like Auditor
11:53:07 <strcat[m]> PdfViewer
11:53:09 <strcat[m]> AttestationServer
11:53:16 <strcat[m]> some of the OS apps can also be built separately
11:53:33 <strcat[m]>  * some of the OS apps can also easily be built separately
11:55:40 <duggalsu[m]> Thanks!  I will try to quickly learn kotlin in that case.
11:56:27 <strcat> duggalsu[m]: most of the apps are still Java atm - they'll be migrating to Kotlin soon
11:56:39 <strcat> AOSP is steadily migrating to Kotlin itself
11:57:25 <duggalsu[m]> OK, will the a look at the code in that case.  My Java is rusty too
11:59:09 <duggalsu[m]> Do you need any help with data science projects? I can help with that.  You can look at pysyft, kotlynsyft project for privacy preserving deep learning. Its current under development

12:10:03 <Sheru[m]> <duggalsu[m] "Do you need any help with data s"> Try checking the os_issue_tracker. Unsure if deep learning would be used besides on suggestion on something (like word suggestion on keyboard (federated learning))
13:08:28 <jcb[m]> When downloading e.g. a pdf and choosing an app to open it, I get the message 'cannot open document'. I wonder if it's due to a wrong setting or it's a bug?
13:13:30 <louipc> did you try different apps
13:15:01 <louipc> i had problems too. i think theres some bug. sometimes just reboot heh
13:17:08 <strcat> jcb[m]: downloading it using what?
13:27:52 <jcb[m]> strcat: e.g. via a browser
13:29:40 <strcat> which browser
13:30:09 <strcat> some apps still use legacy, insecure file:// URIs which can't be passed around between modern apps
13:30:53 <strcat> jcb[m]: does it happen with Vanadium, Bromite, etc?
13:33:19 <jcb[m]> Let me check. I have at least used IceCat
13:33:51 <strcat> probably that file:// issue
13:34:00 <strcat> PDF Viewer has a special error message for most of these cases
13:34:14 <strcat> explains that it was passed an insecure legacy file:// URI which it has no way to open
13:34:53 <strcat> API 28+ apps cannot directly open a file owned by another app, they have to use content providers (which have a proper security model and stuff like the ability to revoke access)
13:35:02 <jcb[m]> I have experienced it with both PDF viewer and MuPDF
13:35:34 <strcat> and modern apps don't use the Storage permission - even before that, apps should have been passing around content providers not file URIs
13:36:05 <strcat> jcb[m]: IceCat is a broken legacy app passing file:// URIs to other apps that they can't open, that's the issue
13:36:46 <jcb[m]> If I open the same pdf file through the folder app, there is no problem, it just opens
13:37:06 <strcat> yeah because the Files app passes around files in the modern (like Android 4.x) secure way
13:37:49 <strcat> jcb[m]: you're using a legacy app that's using Storage and trying to pass a file:// URI that an app without Storage cannot possibly open (Storage is a legacy, deprecated permission - passing file:// URIs has been deprecated since 2016 and was bad practice before that though)
13:38:04 <strcat> jcb[m]: it's the fault of IceCat
13:38:49 <jcb[m]> Ok, I just tried via Vanadium and it actually worked well. I will try this some more to see if I can provoke the same issue to occur in other cases
13:39:02 <strcat> jcb[m]: also assuming you got IceCat from F-Droid it was last updated 2020-02-04 which is a *serious* security issue for a browser, it has 8 months of the steady stream of Firefox vulnerabilities unpatched and it has no sandbox + lack of standard mitigations too
13:39:31 <jcb[m]> strcat: Can you explain again in simple words (I have no technical knowledge)
13:40:07 <strcat> jcb[m]: you're using an app that's insecure and unmaintained, and which tries to pass files to other apps in a way that secure apps cannot open
13:40:42 <jcb[m]> So basically it is a good thing, at the file isn't opened directly!?
13:40:51 <strcat> well, they can't open it
13:41:20 <strcat> there is no way that they can open it without being legacy apps themselves doing things in a backwards privacy invasive, insecure way
13:41:52 <jcb[m]> OK, thanks.
13:42:36 <jcb[m]> I believe I have vanadium running through orbot. Is there a way I can check that?
13:43:11 <strcat> if you have Orbot enabled as a VPN service and set to have all traffic go through it that's what's happening
13:43:15 <strcat> multiple ways you can check that
13:43:59 <strcat> but that's how it works, the OS forces all traffic through it, Orbot has support for passing traffic from a list of chosen apps through the normal network but you have to go out of the way to use that
13:44:30 <strcat> jcb[m]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/FileUriExposedException this was explicitly made into a harmful, bad practice in 2016 (Android 7)
13:45:12 <strcat> jcb[m]: Mozilla chose to disregard this privacy/security issue for many years because they disagreed with user control over their home directory
13:45:23 <strcat> jcb[m]: you're using an unmaintained fork of Firefox last updated 8 months ago
13:45:28 <jcb[m]> strcat: I have set orbot to VPN mode and chosen Vanadium to be Tor-enabled so I guess it should be fine?
13:45:38 <strcat> I doubt it's still a problem in current Firefox
13:45:59 <strcat> jcb[m]: you should just be having all traffic go through it really
13:46:14 <strcat> then all traffic goes through it, simple
13:46:47 <strcat> jcb[m]: by default, it sends all traffic through Tor, the OS routes all traffic through the app
13:46:56 <jcb[m]> strcat: I have been thinking about that but I worry if it will slow things down too much
13:47:00 <strcat> the only way an app is not going through it is if you've configured it not to do what it does by default
13:47:22 <strcat> well just be aware that if an app you want to be using it does something like a download via DownloadManager
13:47:22 <jcb[m]> But I will give it a try
13:47:27 <strcat> which perhaps you haven't set to go through it
13:47:29 <strcat> then you have a leak
13:47:55 <strcat> or maybe you open some file from the browser which is opened by an app that makes a network connection requested by the file
13:49:16 <jcb[m]> I haven't done anything with regard to download managers. How can I check i my apps use a such?
13:49:41 <jcb[m]> <strcat "or maybe you open some file from"> If I realise that, I will not allow it
13:50:41 <strcat> just route all traffic through it and you don't have to consider this stuff
13:50:45 <jcb[m]> Right now, when I check Orbot's settings, it is only Privacy browser and vanadium that are marked for vpn mode
13:50:53 <strcat> make a user profile where Tor is set as a always-on VPN with other traffic blocked
13:50:59 <strcat> use that user profile for stuff involving Tor
13:51:31 <jcb[m]> Can'y just be my general profile?
13:51:55 <strcat> sure, it can be, but you're asking for leaks if you just case-by-case send traffic through Tor per-app
13:52:32 <jcb[m]> Where can I set all traffic to go through tor?
13:52:37 <strcat> it's the default
13:52:42 <strcat> you configured it not to do that
13:52:51 <strcat> by using the per-app mode
13:52:56 <strcat> just undo that
13:53:23 <strcat> if you're concerned about leaks don't deviate from the standard approach of routing all traffic from OS components / apps via Tor
13:53:28 <fritzzguy[m]> sorry i just installed ubuntu 20.04 in a vm and i'm following the guide to build GrapheneOS, https://pastebin.com/m3YtRc0j any idea of what's going on?
13:54:24 <strcat> you're running some things as root so you're causing stuff to be created as root owned files
13:54:42 <strcat> don't know what you've done bu that's not a good way to debug things
13:54:53 <strcat> unless you plan on running everything as root don't mix in commands as root
13:55:11 <strcat> also seems the OS is broken
13:55:22 <jcb[m]> strcat: I am not sure of how to undo that, The only thing I can come up with is to un-mark those two apps under the VPN mode settings. But that seems to be counter to what I want
13:55:46 <strcat> turn off the per-app mode
13:56:23 <jcb[m]> <strcat "turn off the per-app mode"> I don't see such an option
13:56:38 <strcat> reset the Orbot app data, start over, and see how it was at the start
13:57:15 <strcat> I'm not an expert on Orbot's UI
13:58:14 <strcat> it's just how VPN apps work in general - the OS routes *all* traffic through them unless they specifically enable the per-app mode (which I know Orbot does not do by default) and make a list of apps
13:58:24 <jcb[m]> Ok. I will un and re-install it then
14:00:43 <strcat[m]> you can just clear the app data
14:00:46 <strcat[m]> don't need to reinstall it
14:07:03 <jcb[m]> OK, I un and re-installed anyway - and I read a little about it. So when you turn on vpn mode you can actually see tor as a vpn in your mobiles connection settings. There you can choose to have it turned all for all traffic.
14:09:05 <jcb[m]> Unfortunately I now lost connectivity via element!
14:14:59 <jcb[m]> I re-gained connectivity via element by unchecking the 'block connections without VPN'
14:15:27 <jcb[m]> In the VPN settings under the phones connectivity settings
14:16:35 <strcat[m]> jcb: sounds like you haven't connected Orbot
14:16:58 <strcat[m]> and by disabling that you're just letting the OS pass through the connections since the VPN is down and it knows it's down
14:17:05 <strcat[m]> just sounds like you haven't connected it
14:17:36 <strcat[m]> jcb:  vpn mode is already how you must have been using it before too
14:17:54 <strcat[m]> otherwise you wouldn't have been able to choose which apps went through it
14:18:57 <strcat[m]> jcb:  you have to connect Orbot to Tor and give it time to connect, you should have block connections without VPN on
14:19:04 <strcat[m]> anyway going to sleep
14:20:27 <jcb[m]> strcat: thanks
14:20:36 <jcb[m]> I will study this further
14:20:54 <louipc> goodnight
15:29:18 <galyoninion[m]> hi
15:29:56 <galyoninion[m]> I'm looking for a tablet, will the Graphene OS be released on the tablet?
15:37:01 <critic[m]> galyoninion: Probably never. But you can read the FAQ: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
16:13:55 <sjekk-igjen> galyoninion[m] if screen size is important, then the closest you'll get is one of the xl pixels i believe
16:48:12 <alzxjm[m]1> sjekk-igjen: A GrapheneOS tablet would be great. Pixel 4 XL with a USB keyboard is...not ideal.
16:48:22 <alzxjm[m]1> Hopefully a good candidate will exist one day.
16:49:32 <sjekk-igjen> alzxjm[m]1: absolutely not ideal! hope grapheneos gets to the point of custom open-source hardware
16:49:35 <sjekk-igjen> would be awesome
16:51:09 <HagbardCeline[m]> Something like the pine64 famil
16:51:12 <HagbardCeline[m]> Y?
16:51:57 <systemctl[m]> The pixel slate has a titan-c chip
16:53:51 <systemctl[m]> You're more than welcome to pickup the development and extend grapheneOS to the pixel slate (if it meets grapeheneOS security requirements)
16:54:30 <sjekk-igjen> systemctl[m]: i wish i had the competence to pull of something like that
16:54:53 <systemctl[m]> There's books that will walk you through it
16:54:59 <systemctl[m]> amazon.com
16:56:53 <sjekk-igjen> tim to buy book from jef bezo
16:58:57 <systemctl[m]> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072M68RN9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
16:59:51 <Franky> For the google pixel 2 xl is says "legacy". What does the mean?
17:00:32 <systemctl[m]> Means get a pixel 4
17:01:40 <Franky> but if I just want try it out on a pixel 2 for a week or so will it work and be fully up to date?
17:01:49 <Franky> Or will it be outdated
17:02:04 <alzxjm[m]1> <systemctl[m] "You're more than welcome to pick"> No. Pixel Slate runs Chrome OS.
17:02:18 <systemctl[m]> Oh duh, its x86
17:02:24 <Franky> Sooo that means it will work?
17:02:38 <alzxjm[m]1> Pixel-C was the last Google-made Android tablet.
17:02:46 <systemctl[m]> Why not x86?
17:03:07 <Franky> I just want to test it out and I want a pixel phone for under 70$ and the pixel 2 seems like the only oprion
17:03:58 <Franky> Can someone please just tell me in non techincal terms if it will give me a just demonstration of what it would be like on a pixel 4
17:04:17 <alzxjm[m]1> GrapheneOS can be built for x86.
17:04:41 <Franky> idk what x86 means I am not techy at all
17:05:01 <alzxjm[m]1> <Franky "Can someone please just tell me "> It will be very similar to the stock Android experience, just without any Google apps. Some apps may have some problems, though I think you'll be surprised at how many apps work perfectly well without Play Services.
17:05:53 <alzxjm[m]1> Franky: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrDUOtWXGv8 is a good overview (though don't use the Techlore install guide, if you do choose to install)
17:06:10 <alzxjm[m]1> Franky: [These](https://grapheneos.org/install) are the only approved install instructions.
17:06:11 <Franky> but is the graphene os on pixel 2 up to date or is outdated
17:06:48 <systemctl[m]> I dont believe there is even a maintainer for 3a yet
17:07:09 <Franky> But wouldnt that make it unsecure and open to hackers?
17:07:10 <alzxjm[m]1> Franky: Right now the Pixel 2 XL can run the latest release of GrapheneOS, so it is out of date.
17:07:40 <Franky> So the pixel 2 is out of date and it would not be safe to use
17:07:43 <alzxjm[m]1> I'm not sure how much longer it will receive updates. This might be the last one for Pixel 2 or it might get another month, or maybe more.
17:07:47 <alzxjm[m]1> No.
17:07:54 <alzxjm[m]1> The Pixel 2 can run the latest release.
17:08:08 <sjekk-igjen> so still safe, but only for a little while?
17:08:24 <alzxjm[m]1> Pixel 2 is currently supported. It will probably not be supported for much longer.
17:08:48 <alzxjm[m]1> https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/10/05/pixel-2-and-2-xl-reach-end-of-life-only-one-more-update-is-planned/
17:08:53 <alzxjm[m]1> Looks like December will be the final update.
17:09:07 <Franky> but just for a month would it serve as a good demo device to see if I liked graphene and wanted to buy the pixel 4
17:09:13 <alzxjm[m]1> I assume that means that starting Jan 2021 the Pixel 2 will no longer be a supported device.
17:09:37 <Franky> I  trying to decide between iPhone 11 and graphene os pixel 4
17:10:08 <alzxjm[m]1> Franky: Sure. You could also just disable Play Services, I suppose.
17:10:31 <alzxjm[m]1> But GrapheneOS is much more than simply Android with disabled Play Services.
17:10:49 <Franky> And graphene os is private?
17:11:14 <Franky> And do Graphene os and googles android 10 correspond
17:12:05 <alzxjm[m]1> <Franky "And graphene os is private?"> To paraphrase a different user here (cn3m), GrapheneOS has extremely good first-party privacy (privacy from GrapheneOS) and very good third-party privacy (privacy from third-party apps). iPhone would probably have an advantage on third-party privacy and slight deficit on first-party privacy (Apple).
17:12:13 <alzxjm[m]1> GrapheneOS does not use analytics at all.
17:12:31 <alzxjm[m]1> Franky: Please read [this](https://grapheneos.org/faq#security-and-privacy).
17:12:48 <alzxjm[m]1> Read as much of the website as you can. It's an amazing resource to learn about privacy and security in general.
17:12:58 <alzxjm[m]1> Even if you buy an iPhone. Read the GrapheneOS website.
17:13:23 <alzxjm[m]1> <Franky "And do Graphene os and googles a"> GrapheneOS is based on Android 11.
17:15:17 <Franky> So just to make sure before I spend 150 on a used pixel 2 if I buy the pixel 2 just to try it out with graphene os it will be up to date for the next few months and work fine
17:15:27 <Franky> Also is lineage better
17:20:54 <alzxjm[m]1> <Franky "So just to make sure before I sp"> Sure.
17:20:55 <alzxjm[m]1> <Franky "Also is lineage better"> No.
17:22:25 <alzxjm[m]1> When it comes to Android, GrapheneOS is the pinnacle of security and privacy. A related project is CalyxOS, which is a de-Googled version of Android that supports verified boot and ships with microG, a compatability project that will allow a larger set of Android apps to function normally without Play Services.
17:23:15 <alzxjm[m]1> Those are your two best options for a de-Googled Android experience:
17:23:15 <alzxjm[m]1> * GrapheneOS for maximal privacy and security
17:23:15 <alzxjm[m]1> * CalyxOS for good security, great privacy, and near-stock compatability/usability.
17:32:25 <Frank81> This chat room is for disscussing graphene os right
17:34:56 <Frank81> My phone is not compadible with graphene but if I disable all google serivces both apps and play services and gboard will and replace them with trusted open source apps
17:35:15 <Frank81> will that make it as private and secure as possible
17:54:45 <BobbyFrankord> Can someone provide a list of defualt apps?
18:07:06 <zero-ex700k[m]> hey guys
19:10:42 <sphinxcat[m]> <BobbyFrankord "Can someone provide a list of de"> * https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Pre_installed_apps
19:35:16 <adeus[m]1> I just read the release notes for latest updates and saw feature to log out sub account and eject keys without requiring restart. Just wanted to say thank you to everyone contributed to that great work.
19:35:53 <zero-ex700k[m]> What do you guys use for CI/CD?
19:35:56 <zero-ex700k[m]> I'm new here
19:39:12 <zero-ex700k[m]> guys? :(
19:41:32 <louipc> hmm i didnt think there was any.. that would be interesting tho
19:42:52 <zero-ex700k[m]> yeah
19:43:10 <louipc> you seen that for other android roms?
19:47:16 <zero-ex700k[m]> no
19:47:24 <zero-ex700k[m]> actually yeah
19:48:44 <zero-ex700k[m]> i'm in postmarket's group and they have a gitlab CI setup
19:51:19 <louipc> would be good for apps at least
19:51:42 <zero-ex700k[m]> yeah
19:51:52 <zero-ex700k[m]> so how do you guys do things here?
19:51:59 <zero-ex700k[m]> in terms of development?
20:27:43 <critic[m]> Omg, why did I not think of reading a book on android systems? `Android System Programming: Porting, customizing, and debugging Android HAL` seems interesting.
20:27:43 <critic[m]> Are there any other books people recommend? I just wanted a guided introduction to AOSP, the architecture, how everything works, bringing it to new devices, etc.
20:37:34 <systemctl[m]> critic: https://source.android.com/devices/architecture
20:40:48 <strcat[m]> that documentation has some up-to-date and good areas but generic stuff like that is usually not very good
20:41:50 <strcat[m]> that stuff you're linking there is largely about changes between releases
20:42:19 <systemctl[m]> ah i see, is there any books you recommend?
20:42:19 <strcat[m]> it's about device support
20:42:28 <strcat[m]> no not really
20:42:41 <strcat[m]> in the past there was a book I'd have recommended but it's very out of date
20:43:09 <critic[m]> What's the name of it anyway? I'd like to check if there is a newer edition.
20:43:52 <systemctl[m]> i started the Roger Yi book and its not too old, and focuses mainly on porting android to a new device, giving samples with emulators
20:44:45 <systemctl[m]>  * i started the Roger Ye book and its not too old, and focuses mainly on porting android to a new device, giving samples with emulators
20:49:12 <critic[m]> Looks like Ye is the best book at the moment... Trying to find more at the moment :(
20:49:12 <critic[m]> From 2013: https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Android-Porting-Extending-Customizing-ebook/dp/B00BT0IENK
20:49:12 <critic[m]> New book coming in Oct but it's more about services: https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Android-OS-Customizing-Operating/dp/0134096347
20:52:32 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's weird for that leaner hardened_malloc configuration to avoid a lot of issues or substantially change real-world performance, you should narrow that down more
20:52:54 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: also make sure to configure a higher vma_count even with a lower amount of guards slab via higher guard slab interval
20:53:56 <critic[m]> systemctl: Here is another different book by Roger Ye as well: https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Programming-Android-Bringing-Scratch-ebook/dp/B013IQGX3A
20:55:04 <critic[m]>  * systemctl: Here is another different (but 2 yrs older than his newest) book by Roger Ye as well: https://www.amazon.com/Embedded-Programming-Android-Bringing-Scratch-ebook/dp/B013IQGX3A
21:17:43 <sjekk-igjen> question to the community: now that i've switched from a 1st gen pixel to a pixel 3a for grapheneos, do you have any ideas for what i could use my old pixel for?
21:17:51 <sjekk-igjen> or should i perhaps stop using it entirely?
21:41:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Sell it or donate it
21:41:52 <nickcalyx[m]> Or keep it as a backup
22:04:30 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: it's weird for that l"> Thanks, I'll do more testing
22:07:11 <zero-ex700k[m]> What are the dependencies of graphene OS?
22:07:34 <strcat[m]> building it?
22:08:00 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build
22:08:49 <zero-ex700k[m]> yeah
22:12:50 <sjekk-igjen> nickcalyx[m]: that's a reasonable suggestion
22:16:52 <draskosaric[m]1> Hi guys, I am trying to build grapheneOS by using instructions from this page: https://grapheneos.org/build. I received after lot of time of building followinf error: error.GitError: Cannot initialize work tree for platform_external_chromium-webview. What should I do?
22:20:07 <strcat[m]> sounds like your network has issues
22:20:25 <strcat[m]> and you mean during syncing I assume, not building
22:20:39 <strcat[m]> run the sync command again as it recommends, use a more reliable network if possible
22:21:46 <draskosaric[m]1> First, thank you so much for your answer. This is the best network I have. And you are right, I was syncing, not building.
22:22:38 <draskosaric[m]1> Should I need to delete all files and start in empty folder or should I just retype command for syncing?
22:28:07 <strcat[m]> no just sync again
22:28:11 <strcat[m]> like it says in the instructions
22:28:18 <strcat[m]> when in doubt follow the instructions
22:28:26 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#downloading-source-code
22:28:31 <strcat[m]> > If your network is unreliable and repo sync fails, you can run the repo sync command again to continue from where it was interrupted. It handles connection failures robustly and you shouldn't start over from scratch.
22:28:46 <draskosaric[m]1> Thanks!
22:31:50 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: it's weird for that l"> I think I figured out what happened. For some reason, hardened_malloc from the GrapheneOS repo works perfectly fine even with all options enabled whereas my system is obliterated when I use it from the Whonix repo. It doesn't seem that far behind though. Have you made any recent changes that would do this?
22:32:53 <madaidan[m]> Could also be one of Patrick's changes that did it
22:34:10 <strcat[m]> no major changes recently
22:34:52 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: look at what differs in the configuration?
22:35:09 <strcat[m]> I doubt CONFIG_NATIVE makes a substantial difference (other than a really lean configuration where the bitmap performance matters more)
22:35:39 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: but yeah was surprised to hear there were any issues with those additional options
22:36:01 <strcat[m]> there aren't really any substantial differences from hardened_malloc v3
22:36:36 <strcat[m]> just insignificant optimizations and slight edge case hardening improvements without a real world impact (just adjusting some small things)
22:39:06 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: maybe compilation options are different for that build of it? don't know
22:39:28 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't expect optimization to make that much difference
22:41:27 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: GrapheneOS uses it in the default configuration (although we have to reduce arenas to 1 on mobile due to not having 4 level page tables enabled ATM)
22:41:45 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and it doesn't cause many issues other than uncovering real memory corruption bugs
22:41:59 <CaptainPicard[m]> Anyone having issues with their Pixel sporadically not interacting with wifi? I've had a couple issues with signal messages coming through hours later because of this. I assume it's just an issue with my phone
22:42:27 <strcat[m]> haven't heard of people having issues like that
22:43:01 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: look at what differs "> I can't see any differences. It's mainly just Debian packaging.
22:43:10 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: in the default configuration (with the slab quarantines) it does use a lot more memory than a typical allocator since it's willing to quarantine so many allocations
22:43:29 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: are you building the same toolchain?
22:43:31 <strcat[m]> anyway dunno
22:43:38 <strcat[m]> but never seen issues like that
22:44:04 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: also if you're changing the configuration make sure to run `make clean` or use `make -B`
22:44:46 <strcat[m]> anyways I can't explain it
22:44:55 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: also if you're changi"> Yeah, I just realized I forgot about that. I'm an idiot.
22:45:17 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: if you can replicate the issues narrow down what causes it
22:45:28 <strcat[m]> and keep in mind you really need a higher vma_count when using guard slabs
22:45:41 <strcat[m]> unless guard slabs interval is set to a high value
22:46:14 <strcat[m]> if it's hitting that limit it will be considered an out-of-memory error (and not necessarily happening in hardened_malloc - whatever happens to hit the error with mmap/mprotect/munmap)
22:46:29 <strcat[m]> and yes on Linux due to the kernel's design munmap can require allocation
22:46:37 <CaptainPicard[m]> strcat: Thanks for the info.
22:47:13 <strcat[m]> even when just munmap'ing a whole mapping that was mapped earlier (not splitting what was actually requested)
22:47:42 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: SLAB_RANDOMIZE will rarely uncover any bugs unless code has weird dependencies on malloc address order
22:48:01 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: quarantines increase memory usage substantially and make other features more effective but I wouldn't really expect that to directly uncover bugs
22:48:20 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: guard slabs often uncover buffer overflows and also they use a lot of VMAs
22:48:32 <strcat[m]>  * madaidan.: slab quarantines increase memory usage substantially and make other features more effective but I wouldn't really expect that to directly uncover bugs
22:48:39 <strcat[m]>  * madaidan.: slab allocation quarantines increase memory usage substantially and make other features more effective but I wouldn't really expect that to directly uncover bugs
22:55:05 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: if you have guard slabs interval at 1 that means 50% of the actively used portion of a size class region is used for guard slabs
22:55:35 <strcat[m]> | slab | guard slab | slab | guard slab | slab | guard slab |
22:55:49 <strcat[m]> it configures number of slabs before it leaves a guard slab
22:56:04 <strcat[m]> | slab | guard slab | is 2 VMAs
22:56:13 <strcat[m]> you really need to raise the vma count configuration for that feature
22:56:26 <strcat[m]> you can't get away with only 64k VMAs when using it
22:56:47 <strcat[m]> if you leave it at default you need to set guard slabs interval to something really high or disable the feature by setting it to max value
22:57:41 <madaidan[m]> I have it set to 524240 since that's the example in the README. Is that enough?
22:58:26 <strcat[m]> depends on how much is being allocated
22:58:34 <strcat[m]> should be enough for typical usage
22:58:46 <strcat[m]> you'll need to narrow down the issues and get output if there are crashes
22:58:48 <madaidan[m]> CONFIG_WRITE_AFTER_FREE_CHECK seems to be what's messing with Xorg. Everything else is still breaking though.
22:59:05 <strcat[m]> that means it has write-after-free bugs detected when it checks
22:59:21 <strcat[m]> it means it writes to allocations it has freed
22:59:39 <strcat[m]> and then when hardened_malloc allocates new allocations it performs the write after free check making sure all fresh allocations are zeroed
22:59:50 <strcat[m]> so it finds the bugs at the last possible moment it can check
23:00:11 <strcat[m]> it doesn't go out of the way to detect it earlier since purpose is mitigation of vulnerabilities rather than finding bugs
23:00:26 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's a really simple feature and definitely means there is a write-after-free bug
23:00:30 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: what else is broken / slow then?
23:00:40 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's not the experience we've had with it ourselves
23:00:55 <strcat[m]> but AOSP is actually heavily tested with ASan / HWAsan
23:02:09 <madaidan[m]> Nvm Xorg just died again. It's inconsistent.
23:02:33 <strcat[m]> I wouldn't expect it to be consistent - it's not intended for finding bugs and debugging them
23:02:42 <strcat[m]> it has a lot of randomization and the features are designed to mitigate vulnerabilities not help with finding bugs
23:02:55 <strcat[m]> ASan is the best way to debug stuff
23:03:12 <strcat[m]> it programs aren't ASan clean then it's likely some of those memory corruption bugs will get detected as part of hardened_malloc's mitigations
23:04:18 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: you need to look at the output to figure things out
23:04:42 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: if it was the write after free check feature it would be printing the message for that to stderr before it aborts
23:05:07 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: it's not clear to me what problems you're actually encountering / describing
23:05:17 <strcat[m]> I only have a very vague idea of what you're saying is wrong
23:06:07 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: it's not clear to me "> I don't even know what's happening. It's all over the place.
23:06:17 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
23:06:21 <strcat[m]> what is all over the place?
23:06:46 <strcat[m]> what errors are you actually getting?
23:07:07 <strcat[m]> and with what configuration?
23:07:20 <strcat[m]> are you just running out of memory?
23:07:58 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "are you just running out of memo"> Some errors mentioned that but they disappeared soon after.
23:08:12 <strcat[m]> not really sure what you mean
23:08:23 <strcat[m]> the quarantines do substantially increase memory usage though
23:08:34 <strcat[m]> like a few megabytes per process
23:08:46 <strcat[m]>  * up to a few megabytes per process
23:08:55 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "not really sure what you mean"> i.e. even `cat` wouldn't work because of too little memory yet it worked fine a few seconds later.
23:08:59 <strcat[m]> and VMAs running out is considered out-of-memory
23:09:37 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: dunno, maybe you have a deeply broken kernel
23:09:43 <strcat[m]> we don't run into any of those issues
23:10:02 <strcat[m]> occasionally we find memory corruption bugs - they're always actual memory corruption bugs that need to be dealt with
23:10:15 <madaidan[m]> <strcat[m] "madaidan.: dunno, maybe you have"> It's the stock Debian one so probably
23:10:17 <strcat[m]> VMA limit is per-process
23:10:32 <strcat[m]> so that's not the issue if `cat` breaks
23:11:07 <strcat[m]> could be your kernel is broken and it starts showing when the VMA subsystem is a lot more heavily used
23:12:55 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: I would try hardened_malloc on a different OS
23:15:33 * madaidan[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/fFFQGULRflpPeKlgBskuzuDi/message.txt >
23:18:07 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: only reason slab quarantine would cause issues is memory usage
23:18:16 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: and it's not really *that* much memory usage
23:18:38 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: guard slabs use a ton of VMAs, if the kernel is broken and starts breaking with a lot of VMAs that might make sense
23:18:55 <strcat[m]> i.e. if the kernel ends up having some kind of data corruption issues or something internally if you use a lot of mappings...
23:23:24 <signalarch[m]> So I have only been using graphene for a week now and I have heard a lot of people talk about how "slow" it is but I have not seen any of that. Is this because not everything is updated to 11?
23:24:13 <madaidan[m]> strcat: Thanks for the help. This config seems to work fine now.
23:24:27 <strcat[m]> signalarch: where are you hearing that?
23:24:30 <strcat[m]> which community?
23:24:55 <strcat[m]> signalarch: there are people spreading misinformation and BS attacks on GrapheneOS
23:25:04 <strcat[m]> recommend reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawning
23:25:17 <strcat[m]> we choose to use a more private and secure spawning model for apps which takes more time for cold start app spawning
23:25:36 <strcat[m]> it doesn't slow things down beyond making the initial start of an app take longer if it wasn't already running
23:26:17 <signalarch[m]> Reddit, several matrix rooms, I can't remember exactly. Gotcha.  So is this implemented in android 11 already?
23:41:26 <poisonoushydra> On my Pixel 3a I would say grapheneOS actually performs much better than the stock OS. Battery life is improved, and memory usage is improved from not having Play Services. Initial app load times may be a second longer but I only really notice that when opening OpenCamera.
