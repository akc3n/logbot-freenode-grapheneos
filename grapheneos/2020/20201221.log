00:05:01 <adeus[m]> Is a version of GrapheneOS I can run I a virtual machine ?
00:14:34 <strcat> nothing stops you using a VM implemented by an app
00:14:49 <strcat> are you asking if you can run it *in* a virtual machine? sure you can do that

01:28:33 <Cann0n> Hello
01:31:15 <strcat> hi
01:33:08 <Cann0n> Just joined the club. Loving GrapheneOS
02:22:58 <M5upernova[m]> Hello! Just wanna drop a shout that I'm loving it so far! Amazing project!
02:25:58 <louipc> nice
02:29:36 <Cann0n> When did you install it?
02:29:43 <Cann0n> I'm on day 2
03:07:13 <jeremiah76[m]> Graphene runs super smooth on my pixel 4XL. Actually beats stock. No more lag, stuttering, or freezing.
03:31:03 <BenzoNovatore> should i install graphene? i don't know much about this stuff, and am thinking I'll probably mess it up. is it pretty easy to do with the instructions, or is there a good chance i'll just ruin my phone?
03:33:06 <M5upernova[m]> <Cann0n "When did you install it?"> Mid last week on Pixel 4a. Took me some time to fully onboard. Had to review a number of things from secure email solution to network monitoring app etc. Loving the journey so far :)
03:33:30 <M5upernova[m]> <jeremiah76[m] "Graphene runs super smooth on my"> Same for my 4a
03:33:36 <louipc> people have had trouble to install it. you should probably read the install instructions a couple times before trying
03:34:07 <louipc> and maybe copy paste the commands into a file
03:34:46 <louipc> don't use other resources other than the official instructions and this chat
03:34:56 <M5upernova[m]> <BenzoNovatore "should i install graphene? i don"> I'd suggest reading up and planning ahead. Am no expert but based on what I see and know, the one thing to avoid is having any of the processes cut off mid way. Hope this helps
03:35:31 <louipc> read them carefully
03:41:04 <da_boomer[m]> louipc: i am one of the ones having trouble installing.  Followed instructions closely, but after running sudo ./flash-all.sh I am getting this
03:41:06 * da_boomer[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/iKCWfJznIFKAfwjZTwppLMcL/message.txt >
03:41:27 <da_boomer[m]> any idea what I need to do?
03:42:24 <louipc> da_boomer[m]: u have pixel 3a?
03:42:38 <fuk1> "(bootloader) xbl signature verify fail" That looks suspicious
03:43:17 <technoph0bian[m]> Also installed it on my pixel 4a a few days ago. Was holding back because of google camera, but you can just use microg without network permission or sig spoofing and then install google camera.
03:45:12 <da_boomer[m]> fuk1: I am unsure what it could mean.
03:45:54 <louipc> da_boomer[m]: what phone do u have
03:46:07 <louipc> looks like you are using the wrong install image
03:48:40 <da_boomer[m]> louipc: double checking, but im pretty sure the 3a
03:49:04 <sine> Getting fastboot too old; please download the latest version at https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools. when flashing sargo-factory from the releases page.  Could anyone point me in the right direction to get a newer image?
03:50:12 <fuk1> daboomer: I see what he's referring to, it's this line:  "Device product is 'blueline'. Update requires 'sargo'."
03:50:29 <fuk1> blueline's the 3 while sargo's the 3a
03:52:50 <da_boomer[m]> I see
03:52:59 <louipc> sine: what OS
03:53:35 <da_boomer[m]> well my pixel is taking an awful long time to boot up now...
03:54:39 <sine> win10 pix3a
03:55:00 <louipc> you need to use powershell and enter all commands in one session
03:55:12 <louipc> please review the install instructions
03:55:56 <sine> So there's no "newer" sargo?
03:56:52 <louipc> nah
03:59:30 <sine> ok. I dont remember closing powershell but i'll try it again.
04:01:00 <caballer0[m]> lineage>>>
04:01:16 <louipc> caballer0[m]: wrong channel
04:01:19 <sine> Since im in unlock bootloader on the phone, what would be best? To not unlock at this time?
04:01:59 <caballer0[m]> will graphene drop support for the pixel 4 in 2 yrs because its not secure enough
04:02:17 <fuk1> generally you'll need it unlocked to change anything; you should always be able to return to boot later and relock the bootloader.
04:02:42 <sine> ok thanks fuk1
04:04:59 <louipc> caballer0[m]: yes
04:06:05 <caballer0[m]> im looking for hardware sustainability though but it certainly does seem appealing to use graphene
04:06:37 <caballer0[m]> heard snowden talking about desoldering the cameras from the pixel and using ethernet only
04:06:53 <caballer0[m]> routing everything through tor
04:07:12 <louipc> that's not something you can find help with here tho
04:07:20 <caballer0[m]> ik
04:07:31 <caballer0[m]> just thought it was neat
04:07:50 <louipc> your best bet for longest support is pixel 4a
04:11:16 <plane_linuxmetri> Will samsung ever be supported
04:13:37 <louipc> plane_linuxmetri: it will require someone to volunteer to support it at very least
04:14:08 <louipc> but if it doesnt have sufficient security features it would not be accepted for official release
04:14:22 <fuk1> what sort of work would it take?  Especially with sidestepping Knox.
04:14:58 <caballer0[m]> like good modem isolation or whateva its called
04:15:13 <plane_linuxmetri> Well guess ill be stuck with lineage
04:15:28 <louipc> build test every update
04:17:33 <sine> Confused by this snippet of the instructions: Sample output from fastboot --version afterwards:fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874
04:17:45 <hypokeimenon[m]> Samsung will probably never support re-locking the bootloader with a custom operating system.
04:21:06 <louipc> sine: you did the path command?
04:21:47 <sine> yeah- $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
04:22:14 <louipc> now you can try: fastboot --version
04:23:27 <sine> Ok (that's not mentioned in the instructions but thats what the channel's for I suppose)
04:23:54 <louipc> guess it could be rewritten
04:28:19 <sine> I got this output in pshell when fastboot --version:
04:28:21 <sine> fastboot version eac51f2bb6a8-android
04:29:00 <louipc> hmmmm
04:29:09 <Liakde[m]> That doesn't look right
04:29:48 <sine> restarted powershell, deleted platform-tools dir, total fresh start
04:30:21 <Liakde[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
04:30:44 <Liakde[m]> <sine "restarted powershell, deleted pl"> Gotta start over then
04:31:16 <sine> Yes, that's what i'm following and generally where I'm at in the process..
04:32:07 <louipc> do you have some other fastboot installed somwhere
04:32:47 <sine> Does platform-tools need to be in a specific dir? Rn, it's in my user dir.
04:33:17 <louipc> uh howd you download it
04:33:59 <sine> using Pshell with Curl command for win10
04:34:21 <louipc> something is wrong. delete everything
04:34:42 <louipc> then open an new powershell
04:34:56 <louipc> then do: fastboot --version
04:35:56 <Liakde[m]> <louipc "then do: fastboot --version"> That's to check first, right?
04:36:00 <M5upernova[m]> <technoph0bian[m] "Also installed it on my pixel 4a"> I use Open Camera for that. Good enough for me
04:36:20 <louipc> Liakde[m]:yea see wtf going on
04:36:24 <sine> Haha, I did that. Twice. Scanning for additional fastboots
04:36:28 <caballer0[m]> whatâ€™s so good abt goog camera
04:39:02 <louipc> well i dunno sine. start from the top again. i guess
04:44:57 <fuk1> FWIW I got fastboot and similar through Android Studio, it might worth trying that way.
04:45:02 <fuk1> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
04:45:20 <fuk1> https://developer.android.com/studio/install
04:46:20 <louipc> fuk1: please do not offr deviations from the official instructions
04:46:25 <louipc> just causes confusion
04:47:05 <JTL> and it's the same as the platform tools as studio installs...
04:47:07 * JTL yawns
04:47:10 <JTL> just adds extra steps
04:48:24 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, but better off sticking on what works on site, if you know what you are doing, you're on your own
04:50:05 <Liakde[m]> <Liakde[m] "Yeah, but better off sticking on"> as in, what's already stated on the official instruction, it has been tested and known to work when done correctly
04:51:01 <fuk1> Oh, I know I found out the hard way; like how the libncurses5 is required to build GSI but never actually mentioned anywhere in the AOSP documentation; it's buried in the Android Studio setup.
04:51:39 <Liakde[m]> <fuk1 "Oh, I know I found out the hard "> This is installation, not a build instruction
04:52:42 <Liakde[m]> Report to github site if the official instruction doesn't work.
04:52:48 <Liakde[m]> Otherwise, stick to it
04:53:19 <Liakde[m]> <Liakde[m] "This is installation, not a buil"> On topic of installing, not building GrapheneOS*
05:09:58 <da_boomer[m]> louipc: fuk1 turns out it was the 3 and not 3a like I thought.  Thanks. Seems to be good now
05:10:24 <louipc> cool
05:11:14 <Liakde[m]> cool
06:12:29 <sine> frustrating, in system/advanced/developer options the OEM unlocking is now grayed out "Bootloader is already unlocked"
06:13:26 <strcat> sine: that means the bootloader is unlocked already
06:13:27 <sine> When I connect to PC i don't have any options anymore except to pause OS loading...
06:13:41 <strcat> sine: follow https://grapheneos.org/install
06:13:52 <strcat> you have to boot into the bootloader menu mode
06:13:56 <strcat> per instructions there
06:14:04 <strcat> you're not supposed to reboot after unlocking
06:14:18 <strcat> you're meant to flash the OS and then lock
06:16:16 <sine> That's what I thought. But I was told by aleast 2 people here that since it was already unlocked, rebooting after unlocking wouldn't be a problem.  Is there a fix to this? This'll be my second Pixel3a brick (
06:20:16 <strcat[m]> sine: nothing is bricked, I doubt you bricked anything before either
06:20:20 <strcat[m]> don't know why you're saying anything is bricked
06:20:23 <strcat[m]> follow the instructions as written
06:22:58 <sine> Upon restarting, my Pix now doesn't display the usual bootloader interface. I only have one option: Press The Power Button to Pause (loading into Android).
06:23:10 <bleachcrayon[m]> Hey strcat.  Big fan of the project, new to contributing.  I'm a web dev and I had some ideas for the site.  Is it best to open issues on github and then make a pull request for those issues?  Or is there a specific way of doing things that you'd like for the project?
06:24:14 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org is the repository for the main site
06:24:21 <Liakde[m]> <sine "Upon restarting, my Pix now does"> Probably not rebooting to bootloader right? Try it again (power up + down volume button when turned off)
06:24:28 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/AttestationServer site is kept in sync to some extent
06:26:02 <sine> I've tried that about 12 times. Liakde. (
06:26:53 <strcat[m]> sine: go to https://grapheneos.org/install, start at the top, and don't deviate from it
06:26:57 <strcat[m]> you've been doing something else
06:29:03 <sine> Strcat, I'm following the instructions really down to the letter. It is common for the OEM unlocker to be grayed out after you've unlocked it?
06:29:47 <strcat[m]> sine:  it's supposed to be that way
06:29:51 <strcat[m]> and you're not following the instructions to the letter
06:30:04 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
06:30:07 <strcat[m]> it says nothing about rebooting
06:30:40 <strcat[m]> if you deviate from the instructions like this, it's not going to work
06:30:49 <strcat[m]> you need to get back on track
06:31:12 <strcat[m]> sine: did you close the shell where you set up platform-tools? probably did, so start over at the top, get that working again so that `fastboot --version` reports the right value
06:31:31 <strcat[m]> put the phone back in the bootloader menu mode and then start again after the unlocking section
06:31:36 <sine> I don't have these options: Unlock the bootloader to allow flashing the OS and firmware:fastboot flashing unlockThe command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data.
06:31:38 <strcat[m]> *after* getting `fastboot` working again
06:31:43 <strcat[m]> and don't deviate from the instructions again
06:32:01 <strcat[m]> sine:  I've told you what you need to do
06:32:25 <strcat[m]> boot the phone into the bootloader menu mode again
06:32:31 <sine> IAlso my warning Triangle is yellow, not red.. if that means anything to you?
06:32:36 <strcat[m]> get working `fastboot` in PowerShell again if you closed it
06:32:55 <strcat[m]> finish the installation process
06:33:12 <strcat[m]> sine: please listen
06:33:21 <sine> all ears )
06:33:29 <strcat[m]> sine: already, do what I said above
06:33:37 <strcat[m]>  * sine: alright, do what I said above
06:34:34 <sine> question should the phone be connected to PC throughout entire process? It
06:35:37 <sine> s unclear?  Also, should USB debugging be toggled or is that irrelevant?
06:36:05 <Liakde[m]> <sine "s unclear?  Also, should USB deb"> Nah, not stated in installation instruction to do that, and not necessary either way
06:36:23 <Liakde[m]> <sine "question should the phone be con"> However, usb connected to phone is needed for flashing
06:36:32 <strcat[m]> sine: leave the phone connected, leave it in the bootloader mode, don't do things not in the instructions like rebooting or closing PowerShell
06:36:44 <strcat[m]> if you add things not in the instructions it won't work
06:36:56 <strcat[m]> if you skip something it won't work
06:39:28 <sine> I can't leave it in bootloader mode unless I press the Power button which (in my case) merely pauses the OS from loading.  There are no other options via the volume buttons.  But I suppose I try again leaving the phone in bootloader "pause". I dont know how this will work, but I'm not giving up.
06:39:49 <strcat[m]> sine: that is *not* the bootloader menu
06:39:56 <strcat[m]> it's explained in the instructions
06:40:14 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#unlocking-the-bootloader
06:40:21 <strcat[m]> > First, boot into the bootloader interface. You can do this by turning off the device and then turning it on by holding both the Volume Down and Power buttons.
06:40:54 <strcat[m]> sine: you aren't supposed to turn it on and then press a key combination, you're supposed to press that to boot it into that mode
06:41:00 <bleachcrayon[m]> Cool.  Thanks strcat.  Is it cool to just making pull requests as long as I explain what it is I'm doing in the commit message? Or would you like me to check in before I start working on something?
06:41:02 <strcat[m]> press power and volume down, hold them, let go of power
06:41:13 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: well should probably make sure it's wanted first
06:41:25 <strcat[m]> one thing that's wanted is fixing whatever went wrong with -webkit-fill-available to make it not work anymore
06:41:43 <strcat[m]> to make the footer go to the bottom of the page when it's not long enough to push it down there
06:41:51 <strcat[m]> would be a good thing to start with
06:42:06 <strcat[m]> 100vh still works but webkit-fill-available worked better on mobile - doesn't seem to work as intended anymore though
06:42:53 <bleachcrayon[m]> I can work on that.  And another thought I had is this:  I noticed a bunch of new users have some trouble finding the releases page.  I think that's because when they visit the site on a mobile device they have to scroll sideways on the nav bar.  i was thinking of just adding a hamburger menu to the nav bar to help with that
06:43:58 <strcat[m]> is there a way to just always show that it's scrollable
06:44:28 <strcat[m]> haven't seen anyone not be able to find releases
06:45:26 <bleachcrayon[m]> I just see a bunch of questions in the subreddit where people ask "is x device supported"? And I figured if they found the releases tab they probably would have seen that
06:46:13 <sine> I power down phone. Then, when I power up I hold power and volume down buttons. After that the phone goes black, but the only option i'm given is to press the power button to pause Android loading. Have other users described this scenario to you, strcat?
06:46:34 <strcat[m]> sine: no, you're not doing it right
06:46:41 <strcat[m]> that's just the boot process
06:47:03 <strcat[m]> sine: hold power and volume down, you're pressing power and then pressing volume later
06:47:09 <strcat[m]> press volume down first if it helps you
06:47:21 <strcat[m]> then press and hold both that and power at the same time then release power, then release volume down
06:47:26 <strcat[m]> when the phone is off
06:47:31 <strcat[m]> and don't reboot it out of the bootloader menu again
06:47:38 <sine> OK. Let me try that.
06:48:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> sine: power off your phone and hold volume down while plugging it in
06:48:53 <sine> That did it.
06:49:16 <sine> Thank you anupritaisno1
06:49:27 <sine> And strcat
06:50:45 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: nvm figured out the fill available issue
06:50:52 <strcat[m]> Chromium broke compatibility with the old way it worked
06:50:58 <sine> I'm going to go through entire process from beginning now with phone connected to PC. Deleteing the platform-tools folder
06:51:18 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: https://twitter.com/bfgeek/status/1262459015155441664 *shrug*
06:51:19 <strcat[m]> got to love browsers
06:53:07 <bleachcrayon[m]> Oh for sure.  Hah
06:54:37 <bleachcrayon[m]> Ok.  Anything else I can take a look at?  And no to the hamburger menu, maybe yes to a more obvious scroll bar?
06:54:53 <strcat> bleachcrayon[m]: well I agree the site nav is problematic on mobile
06:55:00 <strcat> bleachcrayon[m]: I don't like how they hide the scrollbars by default
06:55:05 <strcat> and they aren't very visible anyway
06:55:13 <bleachcrayon[m]> Totally
06:55:15 <strcat> bleachcrayon[m]: but I don't really want a different type of menu
06:55:20 <strcat> just making it more obvious there is more
06:55:32 <strcat> maybe some svg icon on the right showing there is more
06:55:33 <strcat> dunno
06:56:00 <bleachcrayon[m]> It's pretty simple for me to do.  I could try that.  An svg would be almost as easy as a regular hamburger icon
06:56:44 <strcat> bleachcrayon[m]: always showing scrollbar when present would help
06:56:46 <strcat> if that's possible on mobile
06:57:33 <bleachcrayon[m]>  I'll have to look into it.  I can mess around and try a few things and see what works for you
06:58:40 <strcat> bleachcrayon[m]: maybe we could use our own scrollbar style
06:58:44 <strcat> and have it just be consistent everywhere
06:58:57 <strcat> unsure what's actually possible for the mobile ui
06:59:09 <strcat[m]> with just css
06:59:10 <strcat[m]> no js
07:02:33 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: I'll try to think of other things we want
07:02:39 <bleachcrayon[m]> Cool.  I was thinking just CSS too.  I'll work on it.  Is it ok if I try a few things and then send a PR for each idea?
07:02:45 <strcat[m]> yeah
07:02:53 <bleachcrayon[m]> Sounds great :)
07:03:02 <strcat[m]> there's other stuff we want to improve
07:03:04 <strcat[m]> just happens slowly
07:03:33 <bleachcrayon[m]> Yeah, no worries.  I'm keen either way
07:05:11 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: the approach is slowly making it better in a minimalist way where we understand it all
07:05:27 <strcat[m]> would make sense to add images in certain places, etc. too
07:05:38 <strcat[m]> maybe svg diagrams for some things
07:05:52 <strcat[m]> but only want images where they add value (other than some minor style ones)
07:07:57 <sine> OK, progress.  I'm at this phase: In the bootloader interface, set it to locked:fastboot flashing lockThe command needs to be confirmed on the device and will wipe all data.
07:09:08 <sine> Also, PShell says (in white) Press any key to exit...
07:09:29 <bleachcrayon[m]> That makes sense to me. I'll give that some thought and get back to you if I have some other ideas
07:09:31 <Liakde[m]> <sine "Also, PShell says (in white) Pre"> Is this on finished flashing?
07:10:06 <Liakde[m]> <sine "OK, progress.  I'm at this phase"> And confirm to lock bootloader on your phone
07:12:04 <strcat[m]> sine: did you flash the OS already?
07:13:03 <strcat[m]> sine: after you've flashed the OS, run `fastboot flashing lock` and then confirm it on the phone with the volume keys to select accepting it and power to accept
07:13:03 <sine> How would I tell if this it's finished flashing? Anything to look for?  The options on the phone using vol buttons are: Restart Bootloader, Start, Power off, BarCode, Rescue Mode, Recover Mode.
07:13:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> sine: fastboot flashing lock
07:13:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> And boot
07:13:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> After it boots you can do attestation to verify the install
07:13:39 <sine> I believed it's flashed. Lots of this:

07:20:08 <strcat[m]> sine:  run it in PowerShell
07:20:23 <strcat[m]> all the stuff in code blocks is to run in PowerShell
07:20:28 <strcat[m]> hopefully you didn't close it
07:20:47 <bleachcrayon[m]> strcat: Are you ok with me creating some folders to organize things a little bit?  Like assets/styles, etc?  I'm just  finding it a little challenging to look at
07:21:24 <sine> After the flashing, powershell displays "Press any key to exit..." and is unresponsive. (
07:21:40 <strcat[m]> you did something wrong
07:21:49 <strcat[m]> did you try pressing a key
07:21:52 <strcat[m]> take a screenshot
07:24:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> sine: just your PC being messed up
07:24:39 <strcat[m]> don't see how that could be the case
07:24:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not a PC support channel. Open a new window and just issue the fastboot flashing lock command
07:25:00 <strcat[m]> they did something different than expected like pasting something by accident
07:25:05 <strcat[m]> right click pastes
07:25:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> As long as the device is flashed we are good
07:25:28 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: they'd also need to set up path again, but sure
07:25:30 <Liakde[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Not a PC support channel. Open a"> You'd have to set the $env:Path again tho
07:25:48 <strcat[m]> sine: open a new PowerShell, run the path command again, then run `fastboot flashing lock`
07:25:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> He can close the window and run just that one command again
07:25:54 <strcat[m]> sine: don't know what you did to break the current one
07:26:21 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: we could change the layout to some extent but a lot of stuff actually has to be top-level
07:26:37 <sine> yeah, unsure. Opening a new Pshell win to just run that final command
07:26:38 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: like ads.txt, app-ads.txt, browserconfig.xml, favicon.ico, etc.
07:26:55 <bleachcrayon[m]> Ok, I'll keep that in mind.
07:27:07 <strcat[m]> and the apple touch icons have to be top level
07:27:46 <sine> DONE
07:27:55 <strcat[m]> sine: it's locked?
07:27:59 <strcat[m]> make sure it says locked on the screen
07:28:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> sine: good now after you have booted disable OEM unlocking (optional)
07:29:50 <sine> Locked IN GREEN
07:30:02 <strcat[m]> sine:  ok so you can boot it now
07:30:04 <Liakde[m]> <sine "Locked IN GREEN"> Nice
07:30:18 <strcat[m]> and should be done the install - although I'm confused at the output you said it had for the flashing
07:30:19 <strcat[m]> so we'll see
07:30:52 <Liakde[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "sine: good now after you have bo"> Isn't that sorta mandatory to avoid other peeps flashing other images that easily
07:30:55 <Liakde[m]> Also, Auditor checks that too
07:31:20 <sine> Ok by boot should I use the Start command?
07:31:25 <strcat[m]> sine: yes
07:31:34 <bleachcrayon[m]> Ok I added a more prominent scroll bar for the mobile version.  I'll submit a PR now
07:31:39 <bleachcrayon[m]> That was actually pretty easy
07:31:39 <strcat[m]> Lia (kde): disabling OEM unlocking doesn't make much difference, it's just attack surface reduction
07:31:56 <strcat[m]> Lia (kde): `fastboot flashing unlock` wipes all data anyway
07:32:03 <strcat[m]> Lia (kde): makes it like a fresh phone
07:32:08 <Liakde[m]> Now,  Auditor (on GrapheneOS phone as Auditee) for local verification (of the OS installed) with another stock Android (as Auditor) with
07:32:19 <strcat[m]> Lia (kde): OEM unlocking disabled just disabled unlocking (which wipes data)
07:32:23 <sine> GOt a quick "your device is loading a differing operating system" and,,,, then...well :-)  y'know
07:32:25 <strcat[m]> but you can just go into recovery and wipe data
07:32:37 <Liakde[m]> <strcat[m] "Lia (kde): disabling OEM unlocki"> Yeah, smaller attack surface (kinda) helps in depth, though not that much?
07:32:50 <strcat[m]> and as the FAQ explains we don't have factory reset protection since it's not a security feature but rather a somewhat misguided anti-theft feature (for us at least, makes more sense for stock OS)
07:35:12 <sine> Thanks so much for your help people! I missed a step, unsure if it's vital:
07:35:14 <sine> fastboot erase avb_custom_key
07:35:22 <strcat> sine: no that's not something you're supposed to do
07:35:31 <strcat> that's if you're installing the stock OS to replace GrapheneOS
07:35:40 <strcat> sine: you're done - you can optionally use Auditor to verify the install though
07:36:22 <sine> Glad I didn't then! Yes, will do tomorrow.
07:37:22 <sine> Yeah, too long of a day. I missed: Replacing GrapheneOS with the stock OS
07:37:40 <sine> Zzzz time, goodnight.
07:41:25 <bleachcrayon[m]> strcat: I'm trying to push a feature branch so I can open a PR, but I guess I'm not authorized to do that.
07:41:43 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: that's how GitHub works
07:41:46 <strcat[m]> you have to create a fork on your profile
07:41:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> bleachcrayon: push to your fork
07:41:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pm me for contribution help
07:42:04 <strcat[m]> bleachcrayon: GitHub is annoying, doesn't work like Gerrit where you can push to a queue for new changes
07:42:12 <JTL> bleachcrayon[m]: What are you working on?
07:42:17 <JTL> (just out of interest)
07:42:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> JTL: best not to discuss here
07:42:40 <JTL> uh okay
07:44:01 <strcat> it's fine to discuss it here
07:44:04 <strcat> it's on-topic

08:32:15 <eccezion1[m]> Hello guys, this morning I installed grapheneos on 4 pixel 3 xl phones. On the first 3, the installation was completed perfectly. On the 4th and last phone, the installation was not successful. The green android robot appears with the word "no command". I tried to do a factory reset but nothing. Anyone have a solution? Thanks in advance.

08:58:00 <eccezion1[m]> i try this, but not work
08:59:59 <Liakde[m]> Can you enter recovery mode?

09:00:17 <Liakde[m]> When it says no command, hold power button, then press up button?
09:01:24 <eccezion1[m]> ok, now in grapheneos recovery
09:01:50 <Liakde[m]> Did you fine the option, reboot to bootloader?
09:02:12 <eccezion1[m]> yes i have reboot to bootloader
09:02:22 <eccezion1[m]> i click this?
09:02:47 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, you select the option reboot to bootloader with volume button
09:03:05 <Liakde[m]> Then, if you are there already, try doing the flashing process all over again

09:04:03 <eccezion1[m]> now i'm in fastboot mode
09:04:09 <Liakde[m]> You're supposed to use fastboot, not adb to recognize device
09:04:17 <Liakde[m]> try fastboot devices
09:05:20 <eccezion1[m]> now unlock the bootloader and flash-all
09:06:02 <eccezion1[m]> I don't understand why this installation went wrong

12:53:07 <Snacky> helly together, is there anywhere who can help my by an idea to use graphene as os of company smarthpones with a management solution like an MDM?
13:06:12 <gnost[m]> if you had to connect a laptop to a hostile WiFi network, would connecting via your GOS device to the network and then creating a hotspot be a more secure connect for that laptop?
13:06:59 <gnost[m]> or would it be no different than doing a direct connection between the laptop and network
13:07:57 <bentley> depends on what you're defending against i guess
13:08:49 <bentley> if it's a wep network and you create a wpa hotspot with GOS, sure, that prevents wep attacks
13:08:53 <ayaen_t[m]> gnost:  i do not think the grapheneos device would behave like a firewall
13:09:00 <gnost[m]> leaking information about the laptop. I thought to use the GOS device because of the randomized mac address but I can also just change the Mac address on the laptop
13:09:28 <gnost[m]> ayaen_t you're right.
13:09:44 <gnost[m]> it doesn't do anything to firewall the connect.
13:09:50 <bentley> i should say "prevents wep attacks directly against the laptop". of course the graphene connection would be no different
13:10:24 <bentley> can you even create a hotspot while you're connected to wifi?
13:10:37 <bentley> typically that needs a second wireless card right?
13:10:59 <gnost[m]> it appears that I can.
13:11:22 <gnost[m]> and give the laptop the connection the phone has access to but without the laptop connecting directly to the WiFi network
13:11:43 <gnost[m]> which was the goal. to not have it be known that the laptop exists
13:11:54 <gnost[m]> I'm just wondering if there's anything I'm missing
13:16:11 <gnost[m]> also is there anything I'm missing in terms of information leak. I'm not too familiar with WiFi network stuff but other than Mac address which GOS randomizes, is there any information from the GOS device that can be leaked to the WiFi network. assume that all traffic on the GOS device (and the subsequent laptop) are through orbot/tor
13:16:20 <ayaen_t[m]> just a suggestion here . maybe this belongs in off-topic?
13:16:31 <ayaen_t[m]> im not sure
13:16:32 <somenerd[m]> I don't really think so
13:16:39 <gnost[m]> if it does I'll move over to that. sorry
13:16:43 <somenerd[m]> it's kind of related to GrapheneOS

14:37:16 <malicoye[m]> Viber offers that what I need. But. It was a little unreliable lately. And it has too many trackers for my taste
14:37:30 <ziq> Btw, I installed it a couple of weeks back, following the official install guide. No trouble whatsoever.
14:37:31 <ziq> Just as a kudos to the authors, since most people who write anything about the installation process are the ones having trouble with the instructions.

14:39:01 <malicoye[m]> Pixel 4a HW is what iphones was 4 years ago. It will be a slow phone
14:45:56 <ziq> I don't care about iphones. I am referring to anything supported by GrapheneOS. Sorry for not making that clear.
14:46:33 <malicoye[m]> What I'm saying is 4a hardware is not up to 2021
14:47:21 <malicoye[m]> It's an outdated device out of the box. That CPU is beaten by pixel3 from 2018
14:48:31 <entryware[m]> Makes no sense to compare a $350 phone to a flagship.
14:49:24 <alex-resist> The 4a is not slow at all. Biggest upside is that you will still get almost 3 years of support for a little bit over 300 bucks
14:56:43 <ziq> Makes perfect sense to squeeze out as much support as possible.
14:56:43 <ziq> Mostly wondered if there's any relevant hardware improvements (security-wise) that the 4a has over the 4. But support period and price tag are major reasons, I agree.
14:58:33 <ziq> I went for the Pixel 4 anyways, since the price tag was similar and I had concerns whether the 4a's hardware would even survive into 2023, hence went with Pixel 4 due to IP68 (but hardware sturdiness is off-topic in relation to GrapheneOS).
