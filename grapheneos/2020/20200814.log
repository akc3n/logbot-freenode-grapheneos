00:55:36 <nmrn336[m]> Hi, installed Graphene on a pixel 3a last night. Awesome feeling to be goggle free!  Install was very smooth. Thanks to those involved in creating this!
00:55:36 <nmrn336[m]> Have a question on best way to install Element (new name for Riot). I was thinking to add the repo to fdroid, but wasn't able to find the 'fingerprint' to use.  Any suggestions?
01:07:42 <alzxjm[m]> nmrn336 Element should be in the default fdroid repo.
01:08:04 <alzxjm[m]> Element (Riot.im) (All-in-one secure chat app powered by Matrix) - https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.app
01:08:48 <alzxjm[m]> Congrats on the new install. Google-free Android feels so good.
01:24:03 <nmrn336[m]> Thanks, yeah, it will be nice to carry a phone around more often.
01:24:03 <nmrn336[m]> I found element on fdroid, I was wondering if there is a (optional) fingerprint for the element repo, I haven't been able to find that. Or isn't that necessary?
01:36:10 <marlow11[m]> Seems element is a separate install rather than an update to the riot.im app. That's annoying
08:00:38 <dazinism> nmrn336: probably best use the element version from the main Fdroid repository.
08:00:43 <dazinism> There is a riot/element repo that is run by someone from the riot/element/matrix community
08:01:41 <erhcetua[m]> please talk in offtopic
08:01:54 <dazinism> It offers the development builds of element, which can be more unstable and include a load of logging
08:04:38 <dazinism> If you wanted to use that the repo fingerprints are included in Aurora Droid or on the F-Droid forum known repositories post.
08:05:00 <dazinism> Theres a load of info about getting apps safely here
08:05:09 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
08:07:35 <dazinism> erhcetua: I know stuff can easily swerve off topic here, but think this is on topic, as lots of folks use Element on GrapheneOS  to participate here
08:08:48 <erhcetua[m]> "3. Please don't engage in bikeshedding. Bikeshedding is the act of fussing around trivialities that soak up mental bandwidth and divert resources away from handling bigger and more important problems. This includes certain topics such as:
08:08:48 <erhcetua[m]>     A) Discussion of service providers or asking whether a certain app, service provider, or protocol that doesn't come with GrapheneOS is trustworthy. Services such as mail, messaging, and cloud storage services, are outside of GrapheneOS' control and aren't on-topic here."
08:09:35 <erhcetua[m]> idk, it's pretty hard to tell if this is actually offtopic or not
08:09:38 <erhcetua[m]> kinda mixed
08:10:01 <cn3m[m]> I am a mod. dazinism: is on topic for the chatroom. This is about using the chatroom. This isn't going on long or disrupting any other conversation
08:11:02 <cn3m[m]> I am calling this as on topic
08:11:40 <erhcetua[m]> yeah, it's pretty hard to evaluate
08:11:49 <cn3m[m]> if it was a debate it would be more bikeshedding
08:15:06 <nmrn336[m]> Hi, sorry I didn't think it was off-topic, but now you mentioned it I can see how it is going that way
08:15:06 <nmrn336[m]> Appreciate the help, thanks!
08:18:06 <analtenderloin[m> Are there any plans to have a company audit the source code
08:20:28 <dazinism> Never heard of any such plans.
08:21:27 <renlord> analtenderloin[m: no such thing
08:22:20 <dazinism> I think currently resources need to be focused on development and maintenance
08:24:16 <dazinism> No one is perfect, but strcat has a great record of designing and implementing solid code
08:24:48 <dazinism> Maintained the grsec patches for arch
08:25:29 <dazinism> Made significant inputs into the design of rust
08:26:01 <cn3m[m]> Many GrapheneOS projects are also used elsewhere
08:26:04 <dazinism> Was the biggest contributor outside Mozilla before he stopped contributing
08:26:06 <cn3m[m]> like Whonix
08:27:27 <cn3m[m]> <cn3m[m] "like Whonix "> hardened_malloc and linux-hardened for example
08:27:34 <dazinism> Folks from security teams in Android have asked Daniel for his opinion of features
08:28:37 <dazinism> They are working on
08:30:09 <renlord> yeah, just sponsor daniel so he does not have to hire out his soul to any fortune500 companies
08:41:43 <Vicarious[m]> Maybe that's Daniel's plan
08:41:58 <dazinism> Actually... when Daniel was still working with the nameless company, I think a few big companies did start using the OS and they did have it looked at before adopting it.
08:42:07 <thematten[m]> (Not running GOS yet, asking in advance) is there some way to "seamlessly" use apps from multiple profiles at the same time, as with work profile?
08:42:14 <Vicarious[m]> Work for Fortune 500 companies to spread his soul around, treating them like a horcrux
08:42:35 <dazinism> thematten: no theres not
08:43:00 <erhcetua[m]> well if graphene disappear or is bought, i give up android
08:43:11 <cn3m[m]> <erhcetua[m] "well if graphene disappear or is"> same
08:43:21 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS will never be bought out though
08:43:28 <erhcetua[m]> and i'll go either dumbphone or iphone
08:43:30 <cn3m[m]> and it has been going on for 6 years
08:44:43 <Vicarious[m]> I'm one shit day away from dropping my PhD and learning everything required to fully contribute to the project.
08:44:56 <dazinism> thematten: thats the really nice thing about work profiles, the downside is that an app has all the power over everything in the work profile.
08:45:18 <dazinism> That has negative security implications
08:45:34 <thematten[m]> Yeah - I'm using Shelter ATM
08:46:20 <dazinism> If you not seen theres
08:46:22 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
08:46:32 <dazinism> May be useful
08:47:18 <dazinism> Improving the functionality / usability of user profiles is something GrapheneOS would like to have
08:47:39 <dazinism> The work profile functionality points at what is possible
08:48:34 <dazinism> Is someone wanted to work on that I think it would make lots of people happy
08:50:17 <dazinism> Although theres lots of other stuff that is more important to the sustainability of GrapheneOS that should probably get attention first
08:57:05 <dazinism> Vicarious: just read your last comment and somehow missed the 'day'... had me wondering about the interesting new phrase
08:57:15 <dazinism> lol
09:09:38 <niky> Hello everyone
09:14:24 <travankor_> how can i help with pixel4a support, if anyone is working on it?
09:17:16 <cn3m[m]> <travankor_ "how can i help with pixel4a supp"> @aeo
09:17:25 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: is working on the Android 11 kernel
09:17:31 <cn3m[m]> you could help there if you have a Pixel 3 or 3a family device
09:17:36 <cn3m[m]> that would be a big step right now
09:38:27 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Shelter, now.. What exactly does this app do in terms of opsec? Let's say cloning an messaging app like wire for example. What are the advantages of running them in the work profile over just running them normal
09:38:27 <dazinism> Yeah, moving to a new version of Android is a whole load of work, if anyone can help with the move to Android 11 its very valuable for the project
09:38:31 <pyxel3aXL[m]> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/
09:38:56 <pyxel3aXL[m]> I have a 3aXL. How can I help?
09:39:21 <dazinism> pyxel3aXL: think my link above about profiles covers it all?
09:39:54 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Ahh I'll scroll up. Thanks
09:40:15 <pyxel3aXL[m]> LOL wow this was just discussed
09:40:16 <dazinism> User profiles are safer than work profiles, due to the work profile app having device manager privileges over the work profile
09:40:20 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Sorry
09:46:50 <dazinism> <pyxel3aXL[m] "I have a 3aXL. How can I help? "> If you dont use your pixel as a 'daily driver'/main phone and are prepared to flash test builds of the grapheneos android 11 kernal let aeonsolution know
09:49:26 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Unfortunately I've little experience with using PCs and flashing/loading os's onto phones, my friend got me onto graphene and I'm slowly figuring it out haha
10:49:06 <aeonsolution[m]> ello ðŸ‘‹
10:49:52 <aeonsolution[m]> travankor: the kernel work for the Pixel 4 family is already being handled by anu, let me get you the link
10:50:09 <aeonsolution[m]> ill give you some info to get started on the other stuff and you can ask me questions
10:51:32 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/GlassROM-devices/kernel_google_coral/tree/r-preview
10:53:02 <aeonsolution[m]> but they anu and the devs working on this will need help testing devices; the kernel is the first part of the migration
10:54:08 <aeonsolution[m]> TL;DR, GOS has kernel patches that it maintains for Android 10 and we need to help port them to Android 11.
10:56:31 <aeonsolution[m]> For pixel 4a devices if I'm not mistaken there are going to be on Android 10
10:56:42 <aeonsolution[m]> at the beginning, let me confirm
10:59:21 <aeonsolution[m]> ok, yeah it looks like it will be Android 10, so as a first step to get GOS on Pixel 4a
10:59:38 <aeonsolution[m]> we need to add the device info to <https://github.com/GrapheneOS/android-prepare-vendor>
11:01:51 <aeonsolution[m]> but step 0 would be to build the development branch travankor <https://grapheneos.org/build#building-grapheneos> and I can help you out if you hit roadblocks
11:07:09 <aeonsolution[m]> hi pyxel3aXL, there is a lot you can do to help. like dazinism mentioned if you use the phone as a daily driver you, are really restricted to setting up your phone to download updates from the beta branch and reporting issues as they come and creating a github account
11:08:43 <aeonsolution[m]> if you don't mind trying your phone into a development phone, you can start first by building the development branch https://grapheneos.org/build#building-grapheneos and I can help out if there are roadblocks
11:09:44 <aeonsolution[m]> once you build the development branch, you can help me test kernel patches for the Pixel 3 family i ported recent
11:11:41 <aeonsolution[m]> the patches to port are still a work in progress for the Pixel 3 family and there is some ambiguity in the process but we can work thru it
11:14:42 <aeonsolution[m]> <pyxel3aXL[m] "Unfortunately I've little experi"> don't worry about your experience level, if you have the patience and willingness to learn, i will help you out
11:17:00 <aeonsolution[m]> it would be really cool to have both of you onboard!
11:22:53 <thematten[m]> Do I need to apply all the updates on Pixel 4 or can I just flash GOS after doing one 1.5GB and bunch of smaller ones? It's taking soo loong :D
11:23:36 <thematten[m]> (Freshly unboxed device)
11:56:55 <Vicarious[m]> <thematten[m] "Do I need to apply all the updat"> It isn't a requirement to flash stock first. However, if you encounter problems, you could try it.
12:02:13 <travankor_> anyone building with only 8gb of ram?
12:04:43 <erhcetua[m]> <thematten[m] "Do I need to apply all the updat"> i'd recommend you fully update stock first prior flashing
12:04:56 <erhcetua[m]> so you won't have issues
12:07:12 <aeonsolution[m]> <travankor_ "anyone building with only 8gb of"> to build GOS you need at least 12gbs of ram, because of the linker
12:07:33 <aeonsolution[m]> you can make a SWAPFILE to compensate for the lack of ram
12:08:12 <erhcetua[m]> <hultan[m] "I am trying to install Graphene "> read the installation guide carefully
12:08:35 <thematten[m]> <erhcetua[m] "i'd recommend you fully update s"> That one update ended up being last, so now I'm finally running GOS :D
12:10:42 <erhcetua[m]> you don't need to use AUR in order to get android-tools
12:10:57 <erhcetua[m]> it's on official repos
12:11:16 <erhcetua[m]> extra or community, idk which one
12:11:56 <erhcetua[m]> did you read installation guide ? you also need android-udev
12:13:06 <erhcetua[m]> then you are all set, also you don't need adb to flash graphene
12:13:07 <erhcetua[m]> just fastboot
12:13:19 <erhcetua[m]> follow the installation guide to the letter, and you won't have issues
12:15:14 <aeonsolution[m]> adb is for when the device OS is running, fastboot for when the device is in the bootloader
12:15:34 <aeonsolution[m]> you can dispute the second part, but its been my experience
12:15:54 <Vicarious[m]> Wish people would just follow the guide lol
12:15:55 <erhcetua[m]> ^ basically it
12:16:08 <aeonsolution[m]> travankor: i sent you a message with out how make more swap
12:16:41 <erhcetua[m]> sigh
12:16:43 <Vicarious[m]> Use the official guide, not a video.
12:17:37 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] travankor: i sent you a message with how make more swap
12:38:35 <Vicarious[m]> You enabled OEM unlock and USB debugging?
12:38:38 <Vicarious[m]> You tried another cable?
12:38:59 <Vicarious[m]> You tried another USB port?
12:39:35 <Vicarious[m]> You should run "fasboot devices" first, to see if you're locating it
12:39:58 <Vicarious[m]> Have you set up platform-tools correctly?
12:40:15 <terika0xtkpiq45u> hi
12:40:25 <Vicarious[m]> And you're on the bootloader screen?
12:40:44 <terika0xtkpiq45u> he sure is
12:40:51 <Vicarious[m]> <hultan[m] "What do you mean by correctly?"> Downloading it directly from Google and following the guide, not using Arch's repository
12:40:59 <terika0xtkpiq45u> whats the problem?
12:41:32 <terika0xtkpiq45u> vicarious that is useless
12:41:45 <terika0xtkpiq45u> pacman -S android-tools
12:41:59 <terika0xtkpiq45u> usermod -aG adbusers <user>
12:42:06 <terika0xtkpiq45u> log out and log back in
12:42:12 <Vicarious[m]> <hultan[m] "My misstake, I can't read obivou"> No worries, take your time.
12:44:56 <Vicarious[m]> And have you also set up android rules, "hultan" (https://matrix.to/#/@hultan:matrix.org) ?
12:45:17 <terika0xtkpiq45u> pacman -S android-udev
12:46:06 <Vicarious[m]> Okay, you need to also do usermod -aG adbusers $(whoami)
12:46:44 <erhcetua[m]> it's not needed
12:46:56 <erhcetua[m]> just reboot if it doesn't work
12:47:04 <erhcetua[m]> and try again
12:48:05 <terika0xtkpiq45u> vicarious wrong again?
12:48:24 <terika0xtkpiq45u> i explicitly said <user>
12:48:44 <Vicarious[m]> No, I'm not wrong.
12:48:54 <terika0xtkpiq45u> think abolut what you're saying
12:49:09 <erhcetua[m]> you don't actually need to do usermod
12:49:26 <erhcetua[m]> if you follow the guide correctly you will have 0 issues
12:49:30 <terika0xtkpiq45u> usermod -aG adbusers $(whoami) expands to usermod -aG adbusers root
12:49:37 <erhcetua[m]> don't trust videos
12:49:53 <terika0xtkpiq45u> you are not wrong?
12:50:30 <trismous[m]> <terika0xtkpiq45u "usermod -aG adbusers $(whoami) e"> Only if you run as SU. If your normal user had permission to run that command you are good to go
12:50:55 <trismous[m]> * Only if you run as SU. If your normal user has permission to run that command you are good to go
12:51:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not recommended at all
12:51:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Substitute user yourself
12:51:36 <terika0xtkpiq45u> udevadm trigger
12:51:47 <terika0xtkpiq45u> udevadm control --reload-rules
12:52:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll also have to
12:52:15 <terika0xtkpiq45u> also im anupritaisno1
12:53:59 <Vicarious[m]> Reboot, to be sure.
12:54:26 <terika0xtkpiq45u> trigger udev and log out/log in
12:57:44 <Vicarious[m]> Boot into bootloader mode.
12:58:36 <Vicarious[m]> Power + Volume Up
13:03:05 <Vicarious[m]> Soz power down
13:03:18 <Vicarious[m]> Couldn't remember off the top of my head
13:03:19 <Vicarious[m]> Just rebooted
13:04:18 <Vicarious[m]> Once there, you should be greeted with a black screen with text on it?
13:06:11 <Vicarious[m]> You said you're running as root?
13:06:32 <Vicarious[m]> Exit from root and run the command normally
13:06:37 <Vicarious[m]> fastboot devices
13:07:08 <Vicarious[m]> Also check your fastboot version.
13:08:14 <Vicarious[m]> Okay, so let's download platform-tools and follow what the guide says
13:08:50 <Vicarious[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools
13:09:18 <Vicarious[m]> Just restarts the bootloader
13:12:03 <Vicarious[m]> If you download the platform-tools to ~/Downloads, open a terminal and cd to Downloads. Once there, run export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH" not as root. Then, keeping terminal open, boot to bootloader on your phone and run fastboot devices. If that doesn't work, sudo su to get root, cd to Downloads, run export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH" again and fastboot devices to see if you see the device.
13:13:49 <Vicarious[m]> No
13:15:43 <Vicarious[m]> Okay, so let's go back to basics.
13:16:05 <Vicarious[m]> Boot the phone normally, go to Developer settings and see if OEM unlocking is toggled on.
13:16:49 <trismous[m]> And also USB debugging.
13:16:53 <Vicarious[m]> There can be problems when using an adapter. It would be best to have USB-C to USB-A and use a 2.0 port, if possible.
13:17:11 <Vicarious[m]> And also USB debugging ^
13:19:48 <Vicarious[m]> Okay, plug your usb cable in and type "adb devices". Does anything show up?
13:21:45 <Vicarious[m]> I suspect it is the cable, then.
13:22:30 <Vicarious[m]> Do you have USB C on your computer?
13:22:48 <Vicarious[m]> Could try USB C to USB C ?
13:23:12 <Vicarious[m]> Try all things before going out and spending some monies :)
13:23:16 <Vicarious[m]> Oh
13:23:17 <Vicarious[m]> Lol
13:23:21 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah no problemo
13:24:38 <Vicarious[m]> Make sure it isn't the cheapest type of cable, though.
13:24:40 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah, good luck!
14:52:22 <thematten[m]> Search bar in launcher's apps menu overlapping with status bar is mildly infuriating - is this recorded somewhere as a bug?
15:07:39 <gosdora[m]> Would there be security concerns over buying a used Pixel phone and putting Graphene on it?
15:09:39 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <gosdora[m] "Would there be security concerns"> Only if that used Pixel got its bootloader or other low-level software infected with malware, somehow
15:10:49 <nhscm[m]> user=kalanaama
15:16:06 <Vicarious[m]> Yay! Fantastic news.
15:16:19 <hultan[m]> Thank you for your help and patience with me :-)
15:16:42 <Vicarious[m]> No worries, glad to sort of help
15:32:26 <hultan[m]> Is it normlal to get a warning every reboot, that you are using another os? Before the google logo...(pixel 3a)
15:32:57 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yeah
15:33:06 <hultan[m]> ok, thanks
15:33:39 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Yellow warning is to be expected every time GrapheneOS-powered Pixels are rebooted
15:35:12 <hultan[m]> Any guides out there for what to do first? Like installing f-droid, and recommended apps, etc?
15:35:41 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh "Yellow warning is to be expected"> And I'm assuming the Google logo is built-in with the bootloader or something
15:37:06 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <hultan[m] "Any guides out there for what to"> Before installing F-Droid, I would recommend to use the Auditor app to see if you weren't compromised during flashing, and you should do it before even connecting to the internet
15:37:41 <BlackWinnerYoshi> After verifying, F-Droid installation can be the next step

17:23:47 <hultan[m]> Anyone have any experience using the Swedish identification app for bank services, Mobilt BankID on GrapheneOS? I cannot seem to get it to work...
17:33:19 <textmate[m]> <hultan[m] "Anyone have any experience using"> How does it work?
17:33:50 <textmate[m]> Im nit familiar but in Iceland we have something that uses the SIM card for auth.
17:34:00 <hultan[m]> Well it's not :-)
17:34:54 <hultan[m]> @textmate what do you mean by, how does it work?
17:36:06 <textmate[m]> <hultan[m] "@textmate what do you mean by, h"> The swedish system. See how I explained it worked in Iceland
17:36:20 <trismous[m]> Doesn't it require GMS? That could be an issue.
17:36:40 <hultan[m]> The SIM card is involved, you need to connect you phone to your bank account. Even if I am using the same SIM card as my old phone where it did work, it does not work when I moved it to the new phone...with GrapheneOS
17:38:05 <textmate[m]> <hultan[m] "The SIM card is involved, you ne"> Semantics are incredibly important here. I doubt in this case the banking app is performing cryptographic operations with the SIM card, I think you actually mean its just linked to your phone number, correct?
17:38:28 <rafff[m]> Hi, first time here! I have some doubts.1) the legacy devices marked as such in the gos web, are they still maintained by gos? I mean if I buy a pixel3a which still has +- one year official support, when it finishes how long does gos still maintain them? 2) I guess it must be asked a lot but cannot find a search tool in this channel (first time in riot too),  will pixel 4a ever be supported by gos?
17:38:44 <hultan[m]> It does seem to use GMS, duckduckgo "bankid gms" and it will return something GMS:y
17:38:55 <textmate[m]> ok
17:40:56 <hultan[m]> textmate: Exactly what connection there is between the phone/sim/bank account I don't know. Guess I'll have to read up on that...
17:41:30 <hultan[m]> Seems like others have some problems with that too: https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/issues/824
17:41:44 <textmate> hultan[m]: Its a little bit of derailed so to be honest just ignore the above
17:42:47 <trismous[m]> <rafff[m] "Hi, first time here! I have some"> GOS supports only for the time of official support of the device. And Pixel 4a may be supported if people start working on the support.
17:46:41 <rafff[m]> OK, thx.
19:09:43 <dazinism> rafff: 3a has almost two years of support left from Google & likely GrapheneOS also.
19:10:13 <rafff[m]> Thx
19:11:38 <dazinism> rafff: element android doesnt yet have room search, but the logs are here
19:11:40 <dazinism> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos
19:12:34 <dazinism> *guaranteed almost 2 years, could possibly be longer
19:13:41 <rafff[m]> Great! So many things to learn when coming from a normal life with no worries about privacy. Time to change.
19:35:13 <trismous[m]> <rafff[m] "Great! So many things to learn w"> Make sure to stay on ground. There is too much of it and it can feel overwhelming.
19:37:37 <trismous[m]> Also you can join GOS offtopic for non-GOS stuff.

19:45:11 <Vicarious[m]> I feel like there should be an explanation on how to get out of Screen Pinning before the toast pops up. Just had a mini heart attack trying to get out of it lol
19:45:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Same
19:45:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> This is why I disable it
19:46:53 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah, same here, usually. Was just testing it to see how well it works until I almost launched the phone out of the window
20:43:05 <nij> Hello, I want to join grapheneos! Before that, I'd like to make sure one thing (among some others :P)
20:44:07 <nij> I believe the real way for self-discipline is to lock myself out from my device. On my laptop, it's easily done by locking certain programs at certain time and "forgetting" the root password.
20:44:32 <nij> In grapheneOS, if I have the root password, can I do that easily as well?
20:44:49 <nij> (E.g. kill firefox during work time)
20:45:14 <Vicarious[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have root, so that's a start.
20:45:29 <nij> Vicarious[m]: No :( how does that work then...
20:45:50 <nij> Is there a privileged user in grapheneos?
20:46:36 <ib6feisu[m]> what do you want to do with your device?
20:46:58 <nij> ib6feisu[m]: To be specific:
20:47:04 <nij> 1. Login root
20:47:26 <nij> 2. Set a cronjob or a script to kill firefox within 9am to 5pm.
20:47:31 <Vicarious[m]> <nij "Is there a privileged user in gr"> No.
20:47:40 <nij> 3. "Logout" the user from 9pm to 6am.
20:48:27 <nij> 4. Make sure that the user, without a password, cannot break 1~3.
20:48:41 <nij> Or something equivalent..
20:48:47 <Vicarious[m]> You can install apps, so you're privileged in that sense, but there is no root access, period.
20:49:07 <nij> Vicarious[m]: Can I create a child user?
20:49:24 <nij> And how does shell work?
20:49:47 <Vicarious[m]> There are different user profiles.
20:49:58 <ib6feisu[m]> have you used a normal android device bought straight from the store before?
20:50:18 <ib6feisu[m]> like, out of the box
20:50:23 <nij> ib6feisu[m]: back when I didn't even know what a terminal is
20:50:30 <Vicarious[m]> So, perhaps between 9-5, you could just switch to another user profile that has basic functionality.
20:50:50 <nij> Vicarious[m]: I need that switch to be taken automatically and undeniably.
20:50:56 <ib6feisu[m]> you can imagine your user experience to be similar-ish to that
20:51:15 <nij> ib6feisu[m]: I heard that in android you can root your phone and become root. Not the same story here?
20:51:17 <Vicarious[m]> You won't get that here, I'm afraid.
20:51:25 <nij> Vicarious[m]: T______T
20:51:32 <ib6feisu[m]> no
20:51:52 <Vicarious[m]> You can root, but it is not supported here, as it goes against the philosophy of GrapheneOS.
20:52:00 <ib6feisu[m]> you can root an android phone, but that doesn't apply here
20:53:16 <nij> Sad... thanks anyway :(
20:54:10 <Vicarious[m]> What you're looking for is something  like LineageOS, which can be used with root, as it appears automation is more important on the phone than security and privacy (from a GrapheneOS standpoint).
20:55:34 <Vicarious[m]> <nij "Sad... thanks anyway :("> I admire what you're trying to achieve, though, truly.
20:57:05 <nij> Vicarious[m]: thanks
20:57:21 <nij> I've been waiting for linux phones for years.. and it seems to keep me waiting
20:57:56 <nij> Afaik they are still at the stage of "geeks' toys".
20:58:32 <nij> Vicarious[m]: If I can get a LineageOS totally degoogled, would you thinkg it's still lacking of security and privacy?
20:59:58 <Vicarious[m]> Bootloader will still be unlocked, so yes. However, it is dependent on your threat level.
21:00:38 <Vicarious[m]> Come over to the off topic chat if you want to discuss more, as this isn't the place. /join #grapheneos-offtopic
21:11:43 <adeus[m]> /join #grapheneos-offtopic
21:11:48 <adeus[m]> what server ?
21:15:24 <strcat[m]> freenode
21:16:56 <strcat[m]> not sure why someone would be coming to a GrapheneOS channel to talk about other projects and spread misinformation about GrapheneOs though
21:17:04 <strcat[m]> that offtopic channel is still going to end up having rules
21:17:11 <strcat[m]> I just haven't been interested in dealing with it yet
21:17:21 <strcat[m]>  * not sure why someone would be coming to a GrapheneOS channel to talk about other projects and spread misinformation about GrapheneOS though
21:18:02 <strcat[m]> nij: it sounds like what you want to do is take away control from yourself - you can grant a device administrator ownership of the device and have it do that
21:18:24 <strcat[m]> nij: I am not sure why you think you need a root password, and you seem confused if you think it doesn't use Linux
21:20:33 <strcat[m]> Vicarious: modifying GrapheneOS makes a derivative of GrapheneOS - that's not GrapheneOS anymore
21:21:00 <strcat[m]> also I'm becoming concerned about the offtopic channel being used as a way to funnel people somewhere that's not moderated and where misinformation is spread
21:21:19 <nij> strcat[m]: what misinformation have you spot?
21:21:24 <nij> I'd love to know.
21:21:42 <strcat[m]> the offtopic channel is not a good place to get accurate information
21:22:24 <nij> strcat[m]: I see, thanks for reminding!
21:23:45 <strcat[m]> nij: Android has an 'Owner' account, the primary account on the device, other accounts are managed by it (but it doesn't have access to their data)
21:24:02 <strcat[m]> nij: the Owner account can turn over control to a device administrator app that's granted ownership over the device, if desired
21:24:26 <strcat[m]> and device management apps can manage things in an automatic way (and also do many things that the standard Settings app UI doesn't expose, but which are supported)
21:24:46 <strcat[m]> it's certainly possible to implement stuff resembling parental controls, etc. like that
21:25:11 <strcat[m]> a device management can own the device or a profile, the most common usage is having them own a work profile, but they can own more than that
21:25:17 <strcat[m]>  * a device management app can own the device or a profile, the most common usage is having them own a work profile, but they can own more than that
21:26:52 <strcat[m]> nij: low-level concepts like POSIX users are not how the end user interface or device management works - only a couple processes like init and vold at the core of the OS run as root and even those are not really full root since they still have SELinux domains restricting what they can do to some extent to mitigate bugs
21:29:08 <strcat[m]> a user profile doesn't have a POSIX uid, rather it has a large range of POSIX uids, each app within that profile runs as a unique uid/gid pair and a unique instance of the untrusted_app domain
21:29:59 <strcat[m]> and each isolatedProcess sandbox (like Chromium renderers) has a unique uid/gid
21:30:37 <strcat[m]> it's an implementation detail really
21:31:08 <ib6feisu[m]> those are some good tips. i forgot the existance of the management app. there doesn't appear to be too many open source projects focusing on that. i would guess there's mostly demand on enterprises for those features
21:31:12 <strcat[m]> and the Owner account isn't special at a low-level - it's special at a high level
21:31:47 <strcat[m]> and it can't get data from other profiles, etc. it can just manage what they're allowed to do
21:32:07 <strcat[m]> ib6feisu: most use cases for end users would be covered by just exposing more of the functionality for UserManager etc. in the Settings GUI
21:32:20 <strcat[m]> the functionality largely doesn't require using a device manager
21:32:40 <strcat[m]> there just isn't a UI for most of it so the only way you could use it is adb shell
21:32:48 <ib6feisu[m]> ah, of course
21:33:08 <ib6feisu[m]> that sounds interesting. need to look into that
21:33:16 <strcat[m]> or a device manager since those can ofc have a fancy GUI (generally a remote management panel for an enterprise deployment - but a device manager can be entirely local)
21:33:26 <Dekhran> Just a question, can I install this rom on a galaxy S9+?
21:33:42 <strcat[m]> it's not a ROM and that's not a supported device
21:33:54 <Dekhran> So it's strictly pixel phones?
21:34:01 <strcat[m]> no
21:34:45 <Dekhran> Which page talks about the supported devices? I only found the auditor git
21:34:53 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
21:34:58 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-targets
21:36:05 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS can be built for any device with AOSP support
21:36:33 <strcat[m]> not just the ones supported by AOSP upstream, any devices with AOSP support
21:36:52 <strcat[m]> but there's a difference between it being possible to build it and run it on a device
21:37:08 <strcat[m]> and a device being officially supported with official releases that are tested before even going into the beta channel
21:37:28 <strcat[m]> and meets the standards of the project for privacy/security/robustness
21:37:54 <strcat[m]> which requires the hardware / firmware to be on par along with the device support code (and only the latter can be improved as part of OS development)
21:38:29 <strcat[m]> so you are free to build GrapheneOS for a device like the Essential phone or an Android One phone (AOSP has kernels for Android One just like Pixels too)
21:38:34 <strcat[m]> but it is not officially supported
21:38:36 <strcat[m]> and does not meet the standards
21:38:51 <strcat[m]> and will not have firmware / hardware / device support code that's on par
21:39:32 <strcat[m]> and we're not going to put out sub-standard releases for devices, they have to meet the basic requirements, which requires it being a good target for the OS and having a dedicated maintenance team for GrapheneOS
21:39:32 <Dekhran> welp I guess I'll have to find an alternative since I'm not even close to having the know-how to buil one myself
21:39:59 <strcat[m]> Samsung devices don't support basic security features for alternative OSes
21:40:18 <strcat[m]> you either use the stock OS or give up a substantial amount of firmware/hardware-based security
21:40:36 <strcat[m]> and there aren't any production quality alternative OSes for those phones
21:41:04 <Dekhran> That would make me want to change my phone but money constraints and having changed it 8 months ago won't allow me to
21:41:05 <strcat[m]> most vendors don't bother to support secure, robust support for an alternate OS
21:41:20 <strcat[m]> so your best bet is using the stock OS
21:41:44 <Dekhran> Damn shame but understandable heheh
21:41:59 <Dekhran> Thank you so much for the clarification though!
21:42:30 <strcat[m]> there are devices that do have the basics covered properly for supporting running another OS which we don't support
21:42:46 <strcat[m]> because we don't have infinite resources to identify those devices, develop support for them and maintain it
21:43:20 <strcat[m]> we won't support a device like the Pixel 4a either unless there is a maintenance team that steps up to develop and maintain production quality support for it
21:55:17 <nij> strcat[m]: Thank you.. I'm still processing
21:58:10 <strcat[m]> nij: the stock OS has https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en_CA
21:58:25 <Resynth[m]> Eww
21:58:34 <strcat[m]> there isn't an open source version of exactly that but there might be something using device management or the same API
21:58:49 <strcat[m]> the APIs to do it are there
22:19:57 <jerry_logcat> so I downloaded a pedometer app and disabled its sensor permissions, and its still detecting steps. Verified with other apps. What gives?
22:26:59 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <jerry_logcat "so I downloaded a pedometer app "> I think the stepmeter apps might use something else than sensors, but I don't know
22:27:56 <jerry_logcat> No bueno... because as the recent post on reddit talking about IMU mentioned, this can and is likely being used to track location
23:03:31 <nij> strcat[m]: I should admit that I don't understand much... :(
23:04:37 <nij> The stock OS stuff you posted.. how does that relate to grapheneOS?
23:04:46 <nij> Can I use that in grapheneOS?
23:05:57 <nij> Now my impression is that I shouldn't try to mess up with the privilege system in my phone, if I remain a security noob..
23:06:23 <nij> But I still want to let my device displine me. What's the best way I can do?
