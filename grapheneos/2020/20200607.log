00:00:21 <nickcalyx[m]> > and the first boot may be long ? i  on Google screen for many minutes
00:00:21 <nickcalyx[m]> That part sounds somewhat unusual
00:01:34 <nikoleos[m]> did i risk some weird thing to turn it off and on on that screen white screen with google on it ?
00:01:50 <TheJollyRoger> Nope, don't think so. Let it boot.
00:03:23 <nikoleos[m]> oops im on fastboot again and says enter reason no valid slot to boot
00:04:06 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe some part of the.flash.failed
00:04:51 <nikoleos[m]> so i need to unlock the bootloader again and try to do again the flash script ?
00:05:38 <nickcalyx[m]> Do you still,have the output from when you flashed the first time,in a terminal window
00:05:57 <nikoleos[m]> no, i have already close the window
00:07:29 <TheJollyRoger> If bootloader's locked, then you will need to unlock the bootloader prior to flashing.
00:07:39 <nickcalyx[m]> OK, just wondering. Its not the end of the world,that you don't have it anymore. But it might have explained what went wrong
00:08:11 <nikoleos[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "OK, just wondering. Its not the "> so i can just try to run the script again ?
00:08:23 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Also - make sure you're using the official fastboot. This "no operating system found" error can sometimes happen if you've used an incorrectly versioned release of Fastboot that doesn't support autodetection.
00:09:13 <nikoleos[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yeah. Also - make sure you're us"> on my desktop ?
00:09:21 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes
00:09:36 <nickcalyx[m]> If you run it a second time save the output
00:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. if `fastboot --version` doesn't return something like 29.0.something or 30.0.something, then you're likely to end up with a softbrick.
00:10:15 <nikoleos[m]> sudo fastboot version 30.0.0-6374843
00:10:31 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, that looks to be OK.
00:13:40 <nikoleos[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ok, that looks to be OK."> oh there is an error
00:16:56 <nikoleos[m]> del.dog is not working
00:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Might have to ask around here a bit, I'm not all that knowledgeable with the inner workings of fastboot X(
00:17:28 <nikoleos[m]> fastboot: error: failed to create temporary file for /home/nicolas/sargo-factory-2020.06.02.02/tmp/fastboot_userdata_em9jBa with template boot.img: No such file or directory

00:43:26 <nickcalyx[m]> Awesome
00:44:22 <nickcalyx[m]> > anyone able to get protonvpn to work?
00:44:22 <nickcalyx[m]> Someone mentioned that earlier, that you should go into fdroid and choose the older version
01:09:56 <TheJollyRoger> There are times where I feel like the computer's laughing at me. Anytime OpenSSL is involved is one of those times.
01:11:38 <VincentWantsToBa> TheJollyRoger: lol
02:27:49 * TheJollyRoger flops.
03:34:11 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Looks like I can't calculate the Android attestation certificate fingerprints with OpenSSL alone. There must be more to this.
04:21:17 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: dunno why you're using openssl
04:21:20 <strcat[m]> or what you mean by fingerprints
04:21:25 <strcat[m]> you should be using the attestation code
04:21:33 <strcat[m]> also it outputs the correct values in the errors now
04:21:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh.
04:22:13 <strcat[m]>             throw new GeneralSecurityException("invalid verified boot key fingerprint: " + verifiedBootKey);
04:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> OH
04:22:30 <strcat[m]>             throw new GeneralSecurityException("attestation version " + attestationVersion + " below " + device.attestationVersion);
04:22:36 <strcat[m]>             throw new GeneralSecurityException("keymaster version " + keymasterVersion + " below " + device.keymasterVersion);
04:23:41 <strcat[m]> adding devices just involves putting them into the certificates array then running it to get the appropriate data
04:23:55 <strcat[m]> adding the entry to the table, string for device name
04:24:01 <strcat[m]> you can see all the existing commits adding devices
04:24:02 <TheJollyRoger> Got it, I'll use a more up to date version. I was trying to find another way of seeing if I could make this automated.
04:24:06 <strcat[m]> it's only 5 mins of work per device
04:24:07 <TheJollyRoger> Okay!
04:24:11 <TheJollyRoger> I'll do my best.
04:24:18 <strcat[m]> you just build it
04:24:32 <strcat[m]> if you want it more automated you should use the AttestationServer version of the code as I suggested
04:24:42 <strcat[m]> and turn it into a program that just reads in the certificates and outputs the appropriate values
04:24:52 <strcat[m]> basically what it's doing via the app without all the hassle
04:25:13 <strcat[m]> you should also be aware there are devices with quirks or that are broken
04:25:19 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez.
04:25:30 <strcat[m]> and the earlier samples that weren't used probably all have weird issues that weren't figured out
04:25:40 <strcat[m]> so you should probably start with newer samples
04:25:47 <strcat[m]> although newer devices probably need an overhaul of the app
04:25:53 <strcat[m]> at least ones with latest keymaster like Pixel 4
04:25:58 <strcat[m]> it is development work
04:26:02 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez.
04:26:06 <strcat[m]> don't expect to just add entries for all of them to the table
04:26:15 <strcat[m]> requires spending a day figuring it out
04:26:20 <strcat[m]> a developer doing that
04:26:27 <strcat[m]> most older devices will just be 5 mins of work each
04:26:55 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah... I'm trying to teach myself how to program and how to use the tools concurrently. I don't want to raise any false hopes on this.
04:28:47 <TheJollyRoger> I thought I'd made some headway and then realized I was fucking up... but that seems to be part of the process for me it seems >_<.
04:32:19 <JTL> We all start somewhere
06:54:01 <TheJollyRoger> Night guys.
06:54:30 <analog[m]> Good night TheJollyRoger, sleep well.
06:54:41 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks analog[m], you too.
06:55:08 * DannyWorkOrderPr waves goodnight
08:07:49 <galyoninion[m]> hi
08:07:57 <galyoninion[m]> I have questions
08:07:59 <galyoninion[m]> Does Google Pixel 3a have a security chip?
08:08:40 <galyoninion[m]> I heard security chip called Titan-M is important
08:08:46 <aeonsolution[m]> it should be the Titan M
08:08:53 <galyoninion[m]> yea
08:10:21 <galyoninion[m]> But I don't know which Pixel 3a has Titan M or not.
08:10:27 <galyoninion[m]> please tell me
08:10:48 <aeonsolution[m]> ?
08:12:07 <aeonsolution[m]> where did you hear that the pixel 3 line doesnt have the titan m
08:12:08 <galyoninion[m]> "which "is "that"
08:12:11 <galyoninion[m]> I missing
08:13:03 <aeonsolution[m]> you can check the device specs to see if it has it
08:14:06 <stuux[m]> the pixel 3a has the titan m
08:14:46 <cn3m[m]> The Pixel 2 was the last device before Titan M
08:14:47 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 3, 3a, and 4 all have it
08:16:28 <galyoninion[m]> Thanks
08:16:38 <galyoninion[m]> and one more qu, ok?
08:17:32 <galyoninion[m]> I will install Graphene OS on Nexus 5x that I am not using now.
08:18:15 <cn3m[m]> Nexus 5x doesn't have GrapheneOS support anymore
08:18:23 <JTL> It never did
08:18:33 <JTL> (Well it did long ago when things were different)
08:18:36 <galyoninion[m]> Really?
08:18:43 <JTL> Nexus 5x is old news sadly
08:18:58 <galyoninion[m]> yea
08:19:06 <aeonsolution[m]> galyoninion: I really encourage you to check out https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
08:19:35 <galyoninion[m]> So what mobile OS should I install on Nexus 5x?
08:19:41 <aeonsolution[m]> The website has everything you need to know about the project, we'd love to answer questions that aren't on the site
08:19:47 <galyoninion[m]> Android ? or LineageOS?
08:20:30 <aeonsolution[m]> That's up to you. We don't push a mobile OS because we don't know your threat model.
08:21:11 <galyoninion[m]> I wanna privacy and security on Nexus 5x
08:21:30 <aeonsolution[m]> If you want privacy Lineage is not an option.
08:21:41 <galyoninion[m]> why?
08:21:49 <galyoninion[m]> it is open source
08:22:03 <JTL> Open source doesn't magically make it good
08:22:20 <aeonsolution[m]> Check out https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/ and see what the group has discussed on the subject of Lineage
08:25:08 <galyoninion[m]> I know Lineageos is not perfect, but I don't know what else of Graphene are solutions
08:25:53 <galyoninion[m]> Graphene is not worked, and Android is include Google Service
08:26:07 <galyoninion[m]> Whats else solutions?
08:26:21 <aeonsolution[m]> building Android without GAPPs or researching how to make Lineage fit your threat model
08:26:43 <aeonsolution[m]> those things require your time and effort
08:28:28 <galyoninion[m]> How difference for privacy and security, Android or LineageOS?
08:28:56 <aeonsolution[m]> the log covers that better than I probably can elaborate on
08:30:57 <galyoninion[m]> OK, thanks. good bye
08:31:26 <aeonsolution[m]> good luck!
08:47:51 <cn3m[m]> <galyoninion[m] "How difference for privacy and s"> Lineage butchers security in almost everyway especially the unofficial versions they are hard to compare
08:49:11 <strcat[m]> galyoninion: you can't have privacy or security on a device without privacy/security updates like the 5X
08:49:27 <strcat[m]> are you going to keep Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth and NFC disabled?
08:50:08 <strcat[m]> because you won't have security updates for any of those components and there are a bunch of known issues including available exploits
08:50:31 <strcat[m]> there is no OS you can run on it where you will have decent privacy/security
08:51:14 <strcat[m]> if you want to get a relatively cheap phone to use for many years and have decent privacy and security your best bet is a current generation iPhone SE
09:04:50 <jalb66> Will this work with GOS 🙂 https://nexdock.com/blog/nexdock-touch/
09:05:00 <jalb66> Will this work with GOS? 🙂 https://nexdock.com/blog/nexdock-touch/
09:05:56 <cn3m[m]> jalb66: iirc it doesn't I don't think pixels do usb-c to video
09:06:25 <jalb66> Hm... 🙁
09:07:52 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "Hm... 🙁"> You have to do some funky wireless thing with an app iirc
09:08:12 <jalb66> yes, maybe, IDN how this works
09:08:41 <jalb66> I imagine "share screen" is not what it works here
09:09:03 <jalb66> It'd be great GOS as a laptop 😉
09:11:09 <cn3m[m]> jalb66: you should do some research it's been a while since I looked into it
09:11:18 <jalb66> Ok, thanks
09:12:20 <cn3m[m]> jalb66: you might want to look into Windows 10 Secure Core PCs. They aren't GrapheneOS level, but especially with Windows X on the horizon the leaps and bounds they are making are insane
09:13:02 <jalb66> cn3m[m], I know you trust Windows but I don't, sorry, but thank you.
09:14:00 <jalb66> You were right: The devices you can use with USB-C input port are;
09:14:00 <jalb66>     USB-C smartphones that support video output
09:14:00 <jalb66>     USB-C Macbooks, iPad Pro
09:14:41 <jalb66> https://nexdock.com/support/other-devices/
09:16:16 <jalb66> Although NexDock is not fully compatible with any other Android phones at the moment, we believe “Desktop mode” will be included with most upcoming phones in the future with native support from Google with Android updates.
09:16:16 <jalb66> If you have a phone with video output support over USB-C and Android 10 you can start testing hidden desktop mode with your NexDock.
09:20:15 <cn3m[m]> jalb66: I guess you need an iPad Pro then
09:20:19 <cn3m[m]> For multiple reasons
09:20:23 <cn3m[m]> They are very secure and private and they could even work that if you wanted
09:20:30 <jalb66> yes, you're right
09:22:55 <cn3m[m]> iOS broadly is comparable to GrapheneOS. The distinctions are tiny in security and privacy compared to any other systems imo. Both are fantastic
09:23:38 <cn3m[m]> I'm rocking 3a and iPad Pro
09:24:52 <jalb66> cn3m[m], do you disable "Screenlock camera access toggle" to deactivate the camera access when the device is locked?
09:25:41 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "cn3m, do you disable "Screenlock"> I don't recall
09:26:19 <jalb66> i saw that option in Security
09:28:24 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "i saw that option in Security"> That's probably not a worthwhile setting to chance
09:28:25 <cn3m[m]> Change*
09:29:12 <jalb66> It could be if you want to access your camera with some buttons or something like that, I think...
09:29:22 <jalb66> Like in Gestures
09:29:38 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "It could be if you want to acces"> That's the default config
09:30:17 <jalb66> Yes... and do you think that Vanadium webview needs Network access, or only Vanadium browser?
09:30:44 <jalb66> I know it works without that permission but maybe I'm missing something
09:31:12 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "Yes... and do you think that Van"> Don't mess with that it's not needed to worry about
09:31:20 <jalb66> cn3m[m], ok
09:31:38 <joshman[m]> Came summer and finally I understand how far is Google behind Apple and Samsung display wise. I can't see shit in bright sunlight. 400nits in pixel is less than on my desktop monitor. Let alone iPhones 1100nits
09:31:42 <skratchnsniff[m]> Yeah, I was wondering if things like Gallery need Background data..
09:31:59 <skratchnsniff[m]> And network access.
09:32:14 <skratchnsniff[m]> Does disabling this break anything?
09:32:40 <jalb66> skratchnsniff[m], no, it doesn't
09:32:55 <cn3m[m]> skratchnsniff: it's not really needed TBH what's the threat model where that would be helpful?
09:32:57 <joshman[m]> Disbale storage and you won't see your pictures
09:33:47 <skratchnsniff[m]> Just wondering? Just curious cat questions.
09:34:28 <jalb66> I also disabled all sensors and all works ok
09:34:59 <jalb66> But I don't use an app needing sensors
09:35:21 <joshman[m]> Sensors don't do anything in most cases. Read GOS FAQ
09:36:12 <joshman[m]> Navigation is probably one of the few apps where they are needed

13:38:32 <prisonplanet[m]> total crap, I want to donate anonymously for security reasons.  I don't want to go through the conventional banking system or Bitcoin which are anything but private.  With the Monero I can donate anonymously ensuring my security and anonymity, no one will know that I have donated to GrapheneOS, I want to support GrapheneOS because it is a very important project for our privacy but not with currencies devoid of any
13:38:32 <prisonplanet[m]> confidentiality.
13:40:17 <prisonplanet[m]> The current volatility of the Monero is not a problem, Daniel will just have to convert the Monero into fiat currency as soon as he receives it, it's not complicated.
13:44:02 <joshman[m]> Ok. No further comments. You know Jack sh about Bitcoin. Do your due diligence and come back later.
13:44:02 <joshman[m]> Just a quick tip. Convert xmr to btc in your trust wallet, coinomi wallet or any other Dex. Quick, cheap, anonymous

13:50:36 <renlord> anonimity operates on a spectrum.
13:50:45 <joshman[m]> He is wrong. Though xmr is pretty good it's not bulletproof
13:51:11 <renlord> there's no boolean classification for anonymity.
13:51:36 <renlord> especially so with bitcoin and xmr
13:52:03 <renlord> you mix until you find the degree of obfuscation is satisfactory to meet your anonymity criterion
13:52:53 <joshman[m]> He is just xmr fanboy. Otherwise he would know that ZEC has been proven "better" anonymity, not "total anonymity"
13:53:23 <renlord> joshman[m]: not really either, the set of people that use zec is so small and the subset of people that use sheilded transactions even smaller
13:53:30 <renlord> the moment you use it, you're already flagged.

18:34:13 <nickcalyx[m]> > or there some other way to get update notification?
18:34:13 <nickcalyx[m]> It can get updates via aurora
18:35:38 <generateduser392> I'm unable to open photo after taking it
18:35:49 <generateduser392> gives black screen
18:36:02 <generateduser392>  * I'm unable to open photo in app after taking it
18:36:50 <cyredanthem[m]1> generateduser710: you need Google gallery
18:40:54 <joshman[m]> You need Google Fotos
18:43:22 <jalb66> With Simple Gallery you can view them and it's free and opensource
18:46:53 <brenneke[m]> <jalb66 "With Simple Gallery you can view"> Photo viewing working from gcam her,  Simple Gallery installed, stock Gallery disabled.
18:47:13 <brenneke[m]> No Google Photos installed.
18:48:50 <joshman[m]> Can you open last picture from gcam directly, cause that's what generateduser710  was asking
18:49:22 <brenneke[m]> Yes.
18:49:50 <generateduser392> you use xda or apkmirror version?
18:50:20 <brenneke[m]> XDA.
18:51:27 <generateduser392> thats older version and edited by someone else
18:52:33 <brenneke[m]> Snap photo, select round picture icon bottom right, opens pic and lets me scroll to other pics in gallery. Also lets me delete without confirmation which I like.
18:53:36 <joshman[m]> Simple gallery sucks big time. viewing is not smooth. basic photo editing tools missing. Needs Snapseed or something to edit. Google Fotos is ideal
18:54:18 <joshman[m]> Delete without confirmation is dope though
18:57:10 <brenneke[m]> Mine allows pic editing without an extras. Careful with Simple apps, there are other developers also using Simple name. Tibor Kaputa is the right developer.

19:01:12 <cereal_eater> are Simple apps trustworthy regarding safety and privacy?
19:01:12 <joshman[m]> Open source apps is false feeling of security
19:01:39 <generateduser392> they're good and simple
19:01:53 <generateduser392> only covers basics, no fancy features
19:02:02 <jalb66> joshman[m], if someone can review the code, is it false?, you don't know what's inside a closed source app
19:02:23 <joshman[m]> Simple apps are open source yet people ask is it safe and secure?
19:02:27 <jalb66> But I won't begin a discussion about it, it's only a choice
19:02:30 <cereal_eater> I am thinking of replacing the stock sms and phone app, but I am hesitating
19:02:30 <generateduser392> <jalb66 "josh.man, if someone can review "> in theory, they're good
19:02:47 <joshman[m]> Nobody is reviewing code. Graphene OS lacks developers
19:03:11 <jalb66> joshman[m], I mean when I install a new app
19:03:16 <generateduser392> as someone who knows jack-shit about code, I have to trust that others have reviewed the code
19:03:25 <generateduser392> and trust their judgment
19:03:34 <brenneke[m]> <cereal_eater "are Simple apps trustworthy rega"> Their mission statement here:
19:03:35 <jalb66> And it doesn't mean safe and secure, only that it doesn't contain backdoors
19:04:08 <joshman[m]> When were Simple apps code last audited? Never?
19:04:42 <generateduser392> <cereal_eater "I am thinking of replacing the s"> signal or qksms, I use graphene default for phone
19:04:48 <jalb66> You can check the code at least, it's better than being impossible to do it

19:08:43 <generateduser392> no need extra fancy features
19:09:19 <generateduser392> don't think signal works for sms only
19:09:27 <generateduser392> without registering for their service
19:09:55 <nickcalyx[m]> signal would probably work for sms only but you can't really enter the app until you register
19:10:19 <joshman[m]> AOSP stock apps are such a mess in design. Phone app no dark mode, clock app electro blue. What are those guys smoking when they code?
19:10:29 <brenneke[m]> <generateduser392 "without registering for their se"> Not sure but Signal is much better to use than WhatsApo, Messenger etc.
19:11:27 <generateduser392> <joshman[m] "AOSP stock apps are such a mess "> rolled up bills from ad money
19:12:09 <joshman[m]> Better not to mix signal with SMS from 1980s. They should be avoided not embraced. If I was lead dev I'd remove that option
19:12:44 <generateduser392> Why?
19:13:17 <TheJollyRoger> joshman[m]: this is actually by design. Remember that network effect, and transparency of use is what drives adoption.
19:13:39 <TheJollyRoger> The idea being, Signal wants users to not feel like they're going out of their way to use encryption, and can use it opportunistically.
19:14:18 <TheJollyRoger> So far, Signal holds my personal record of "Time between falling back to plaintext" of three years, since roughly 2017, with one exception that was actually /my fault./
19:14:46 <cereal_eater> what daoes that mean that the terms of use of the phone app leads to a google website. is it that it just uses code from aosp?
19:15:01 <generateduser392> yea
19:15:22 <joshman[m]> Nah. I prefer iPhone approach. No other sms apps other than stock. SMS is 40 years old. How many more years do people need that pigeon mail is outdated?
19:15:23 <TheJollyRoger> So it's not a misfeature or a bug. You should read the paper Obstacles to Adoption of Secure Communication Tools released by the University of Bonn and University College London (You may recognize several of its authors, one of them wrote the improved EFF Diceware Worldlist)
19:16:08 <generateduser392> minimizing number of apps and services on phone
19:16:25 <joshman[m]> * Nah. I prefer iPhone approach. No other sms apps other than stock. SMS is 40 years old. How many more years do people need to understand that pigeon mail is outdated?
19:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Again, it's your own personal preference, but for the majority of people, they don't /want/ to have 20 different messaging apps that they need to check separately.
19:17:00 <TheJollyRoger> It's a principle of harm reduction.
19:17:07 <generateduser392> thats why people install entire google spyware bundle (I mean suite)
19:17:30 <joshman[m]> We are speaking about two apps not 20 and one of them is 40 years old
19:18:00 <TheJollyRoger> Even two apps is a cognitive load on most users who'd just prefer their apps to work, and the SMS userbase is very entrenched.
19:18:22 <generateduser392> similar idea, just number difference
19:18:59 <TheJollyRoger> Remember, you're experienced enough to install GrapheneOS. Most people aren't going to go that far. Most people would rather just tap through the launcher and not even change the defaults!
19:19:12 <TheJollyRoger> So how can you expect them to maintain two separate apps for what appears to them to inevitably do the same thing?
19:19:28 <generateduser392> FOSS masterrace? /s
19:19:51 <joshman[m]> Most people use messenger, WA, Instagram direct and a bunch of other messengers
19:19:54 <TheJollyRoger> In fact, for people like those, which is to say a majority of the population, it's better that the platform be consolidated, since at least that way they can't fall back to the insecure one out of /simple laziness/.
19:19:58 <dallemon[m]> Plus Signal also keeps your SMS stored securely
19:20:08 <aeonsolution[m]> i don't think we should characterize people as by default not caring about their privacy generateduser710
19:20:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yes -- so the fact we can get them to use Signal is a massive milestone.
19:20:19 <aeonsolution[m]> people just don't know
19:20:19 <joshman[m]> SMS app ja only for banking confirmation which is absolutely insane in 2020
19:20:41 <TheJollyRoger> Agreed on that point, but I think you should read that study. I'll link it to you...
19:20:52 <aeonsolution[m]> hey everyone, here's another call to help those wanting to help out with Vanadium
19:20:56 <generateduser392> <aeonsolution[m] "i don't think we should characte"> didn't say that, was saying they prioritize ease of use over privacy
19:21:02 <brenneke[m]> <joshman[m] "* Nah. I prefer iPhone approach."> Signal started as TextSecure which encrypted SMS messages. They now have evolved away from that, but kept SMS in their app so you can invite non-Signal users.......if I have it right.
19:21:29 <aeonsolution[m]> right, because they don't know what they are giving up
19:21:50 <TheJollyRoger> https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/84.pdf joshman[m] , check this out.
19:22:18 <joshman[m]> Will do !
19:22:28 <TheJollyRoger> brenneke[m]: yes. These days, contact discovery is expected to be automatic, is expected to be transparent, and is expected to be human-meaningful. Without those, there's no hope for meaningful adoption.
19:24:40 <TheJollyRoger> A large takeaway from this paper is that there is a disparity between what users want in a secure messaging app, and what we, the crypto/ITSec nerds believe them to want in a secure messaging app, and why previous efforts to introduce secure messaging tools have faced a lot of problems in the past and still continue to today.
19:25:40 <generateduser392> technical jargon confuses and is a major turnoff for most
19:26:29 <TheJollyRoger> Yes. In fact, something that may blow your mind: many ordinary average users that this study interviewed actually believed /obscurity was a benefit/ and percieved open source as a drawback!
19:28:26 <jalb66> 🙂
19:28:34 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: I'm talking about a study.
19:28:51 <TheJollyRoger> Where they were trying to find out /why/ people didn't adopt secure communication tools even given their prevalance and ease of use.
19:28:54 <jalb66> I know
19:29:28 <joshman[m]> They are right in a way. Apple's obscurity helps security
19:29:34 <generateduser392> same thing holds true for all fields, not just tech
19:30:21 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. To /us/ it seems obvious and totally "whaa?!", but to us it's hard for us to place ourselves in the shoes of someone with no knowledge, an incomplete threat model, no understanding of how things work, and who can only rely on what they see.
19:31:03 <generateduser392> plus few want to spend time to start from basics
19:31:09 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
19:31:12 <generateduser392> they expect to jump in and understand everything
19:31:13 <joshman[m]> Signal is older than WhatsApp yet latter is #2 in the world
19:31:14 <joshman[m]> Xmpp is safer than Signal yet nobody uses it in daily conversations
19:32:12 <jalb66> joshman[m], I use xmpp in daily conversations but I think Signal is safer
19:32:22 <TheJollyRoger> I disagree: XMPP suffers from the same problem where you need to trust the server with your contact list and there's no domain fronting nor cover traffic.
19:33:05 <jalb66> But it's because I use some channels too in xmpp
19:33:23 <TheJollyRoger> So essentially if you're using a private XMPP server, even if you trust the server, someone with the ability to pervasively and passively monitor the network can simply see all the connections and packets flowing to it.
19:33:32 <TheJollyRoger> Since you and your buddies will be the only ones on it.
19:34:29 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, but I think Matrix is worst in privacy than xmpp, but it's making many efforts lately
19:34:33 <joshman[m]> Signal has got many drawbacks as well, so I wouldn't be so sure about who's safer here
19:34:44 <joshman[m]> * Signal has got many drawbacks too, so I wouldn't be so sure about who's safer here
19:35:24 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: yes, I think a bit back I did a bit of smalltalk on Matrix/Riot, few days ago or last week. It was one of those "get a drink because we could be here for a long time" ones.
19:35:40 <jalb66> And consume many resources
19:36:01 <jalb66> xmpp is fast and easy
19:36:08 <TheJollyRoger> Indeed Signal's not a perfect, but it's a hell of a lot safer than the dumpster fire that's XMPP with storing the contact list in plaintext, the messy state of addons and fragmented clients --
19:36:40 <TheJollyRoger> in fact, one of the reasons I abandoned XMPP is because the software plugins to use OMEMO are mostly written in Python2.
19:36:44 <TheJollyRoger> They're going to stop working soon.
19:36:52 <TheJollyRoger> If not, they already have.
19:37:16 <TheJollyRoger> *contact list in plaintext on the server,
19:38:09 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, interesting
19:39:04 <jalb66> maybe an update?
19:39:15 <TheJollyRoger> Then the issue is, what happens when your contact is located on a different server? On Signal, this is no problem, because with Sealed Sender, half the metadata is encrypted and inaccessible to the server anyways.
19:39:49 <TheJollyRoger> On XMPP? Well you'd better hope that your recieving server enforces STS-TLS with strict validation and no fallback, and yours does too.
19:39:56 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, but note that in xmpp the contact is not a phone, it's a nickname
19:40:09 <TheJollyRoger> You'd also better hope that you can trust not one, but now /TWO/ service providers!
19:40:31 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: on Signal the contact list isn't sent to the server, it's matched via hashes.
19:40:45 <jalb66> I don't allow the contact list in xmpp
19:40:55 <jalb66> I only add accounts
19:40:55 <joshman[m]> Nicknames Are soon to hit Signal
19:41:16 <jalb66> joshman[m], that would be great
19:41:20 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: look at the standard for XMPP when you add a contact to your XMPP account.
19:41:40 <TheJollyRoger> It's not your phone's contact list, it's who you contact via XMPP.
19:41:46 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, it always ask me for that permission in Conversations, but I don't allow it
19:41:52 <jalb66> Ah ok
19:42:06 <joshman[m]> Nicknames and conference calls pretty much are coming same time
19:42:08 <jalb66> But all people are only nicknames
19:42:25 <jalb66> It could be anyone
19:42:42 <TheJollyRoger> yes. Nicknames are coming to Signal in the near-future and they're hoping to improve the anonymity properties of it.
19:42:56 <TheJollyRoger> Again though, this is something addressed by the paper.
19:43:07 <TheJollyRoger> Of why they chose phone numbers initially.
19:44:48 <joshman[m]> They've been hiring recently. Only US folks allowed. No good imo
19:45:00 <nickcalyx[m]> how is it only US folks allowed
19:45:38 <joshman[m]> The excuse was due to time difference productiveness would suffer
19:46:49 <joshman[m]> Only US devs could apply for open positions
19:47:12 <jalb66> TheJollyRoger, and what about USA requering access to all the servers or apps/programs in the country?, is that true?
19:47:20 <joshman[m]> *  US based devs only could apply for open positions
19:47:35 <jalb66> They also want to avoid encryption
19:47:44 <jalb66> Or only a rumour
19:48:19 <joshman[m]> Not a rumour
19:48:19 <joshman[m]> The law is under development
19:48:34 <joshman[m]> * Not a rumour
19:48:34 <joshman[m]> The law is in development
19:48:49 <nickcalyx[m]> there are always proposals but there is no such access
19:49:17 <jalb66> ok
19:49:51 <TheJollyRoger> jalb66: if EARN-IT passes, we'll have to move platforms, or Signal will need to relocate. Or we can start simply compiling from source.
19:49:57 <nickcalyx[m]> I mean, the NSA spies on everything, we know this from Snowden.  But that doesn't mean they can break crypto at scale
19:50:16 <jalb66> Yeah
19:50:24 <TheJollyRoger> After all, the rationale behind the Signal client software is that we /distrust the server./
19:50:32 <jalb66> That's true
19:50:48 <jalb66> Even there are some forks out there
19:52:45 <joshman[m]> The deal is to get as much folks on Signal as possible then pass the bill and voila you're decrypted. WeChat 2.0
19:53:29 <joshman[m]> I read Signal won't relocate servers if Bill gets through
19:53:59 <jalb66> Briar then
19:54:25 <jalb66> Maybe Session, but I don't trust it yet
19:54:38 <jalb66> Maybe Session, but I don't trust in it yet

20:02:38 <fire-water56[m]> As you can see, I am confused...lol
20:02:39 <TheJollyRoger> Then when you try to unzip it it's saying "I'm not finding a proper zip."
20:02:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Try this one:

20:03:59 <fire-water56[m]> ok, so just copy that and paste in to the terminal then enter

20:08:03 <fire-water56[m]> then I used the sudo in front of it
20:08:18 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: you're in a location you're not privileged to write to.
20:08:27 <TheJollyRoger> "cd ~"
20:08:31 <TheJollyRoger> Er, without quotes
20:08:49 <TheJollyRoger> Then "ls -lah" and see if you have write permission in your home directory.
20:09:20 <TheJollyRoger> You'er in /usr/

20:09:35 <TheJollyRoger> Also - are you using the official release of adb or the one that came in your operating system repository?
20:09:57 <fire-water56[m]> that is my latest in terminal
20:10:01 <TheJollyRoger> no, "cd ~" and "ls -lah" are separate commands
20:10:04 <fire-water56[m]> after you said to stop , I was already download and foolish me typed stop... as you can see it
20:10:29 <TheJollyRoger> If you want to put them on the same line, do "cd ~ && ls -lah"

20:11:52 <TheJollyRoger> You're in a location that's only writable by root.
20:12:19 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Now try this:
20:12:31 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Also - are you using the officia"> honestly I don't know
20:12:35 <TheJollyRoger> curl -O https://releases.grapheneos.org/sargo-factory-2020.06.02.02.zip
20:13:33 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "curl -O https://releases.graphen"> I tried that command and now it is downloading again
20:13:41 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: ok, when that command is finished, I want you to try "fastboot --version" If it says anything less than "29.0" then stop right there because it will likely softbrick your phone.
20:13:48 <fire-water56[m]> Thank you very much for your help so far
20:14:10 <TheJollyRoger> Anytime!
20:14:21 <fire-water56[m]> ok will do. It looks like I am at 21% and then I will try the fastboot version
20:14:31 <TheJollyRoger> Or, while it's downloading, open up another terminal window.
20:14:48 <TheJollyRoger> "fastboot --version" will simply print out the version of fastboot you have.

20:15:54 <TheJollyRoger> It looks like Elementary OS is an Ubuntu fork, so we're going to need to set your udev rules next.
20:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. You're about to brick your phone -- you will need to uninstall fastboot because you've installed the version from Elementary.
20:16:44 <TheJollyRoger> So you'll need to uninstall it and then we'll install the official release.
20:17:27 <fire-water56[m]> Wheew....dang
20:17:29 <fire-water56[m]> thank you
20:17:33 <TheJollyRoger> (It won't be hardbricked, it'll just say "No operating system found" because it'll likely fail autodetection. It won't be permanent.)
20:17:48 <TheJollyRoger> (But it's annoying because you'll have to do it a second time)
20:17:50 <fire-water56[m]> ok the download is complete
20:19:11 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. Before we go any further, we've got to get that obsolete version of fastboot off your system. I don't remember the command sequence from Ubuntu but I think it's something like "sudo apt remove fastboot" if it was installed as fastboot, but I'm not sure what the name is so give me a moment.
20:19:36 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Ok. Before we go any further, we"> absolutely... thank you
20:21:02 <generateduser392> <TheJollyRoger "(It won't be hardbricked, it'll "> is it because there are 2 slots (A and B)?
20:21:03 <TheJollyRoger> Can you do me a quick favour and run "apt search android-platform-tools" ? If it doesn't return anything, try "apt search fastboot"
20:21:51 * fire-water56[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KnAIdjjqHANMJaDEfrgZjazn >
20:22:05 <TheJollyRoger> generateduser392: yeah. If I recall right, older versions of fastboot don't respect that, the version of ADB will be butchered so it won't report it as obsolete, and then they'll not set it correctly.

20:24:58 <TheJollyRoger> ok fire-water56[m] can you run for me "sudo apt remove android-sdk-platform-tools-common" ?
20:25:25 <fire-water56[m]> sure hold on

20:26:03 <TheJollyRoger> It looks like indeed installed fastboot with it, hopefully this'll remove it...
20:26:43 <TheJollyRoger> Ok, try "fastboot --version" and see if it gives you "command not found." If it does, we're looking good. If not, "sudo apt remove fastboot" .

20:28:40 <TheJollyRoger> Excellent!
20:29:14 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. So now we're going to get you the official platform tools from upstream which should be correctly versioned, and then we're going to set your udev rules.
20:29:34 <TheJollyRoger> Yikes Matrix seems disconnect-ey today.
20:30:20 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. I'm going to want you to run the following:

20:36:02 <TheJollyRoger> What is it giving you?
20:36:20 <TheJollyRoger> I'm putting a script up for you.
20:36:27 <fire-water56[m]> ok

20:39:09 <generateduser392> so need to flash 2 times, once for each slot?
20:39:35 <TheJollyRoger> generateduser392: no, it needs to support autodetection.
20:39:43 <generateduser392> was it slot B for you when you installed graphene?
20:40:15 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: I'm going to send you a script.
20:40:29 <TheJollyRoger> https://jollyrogers.ca/public/prepare-elementary.txt
20:41:04 <TheJollyRoger> Can you run "wget -v" for me and see if it produces a help page?
20:41:29 <TheJollyRoger> generateduser392: I have no idea, if your fastboot supports autodetection it will determine which is the correct one and set the correct one properly.
20:41:35 <TheJollyRoger> Er, sorry,
20:41:41 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: "wget -h"
20:42:03 <TheJollyRoger> Then download this script, save it as a .sh, change the permissions so you can execute it via the commandline, and then run it.
20:42:18 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Then download this script, save "> it does produce a help page.

20:43:49 <TheJollyRoger> generateduser392: when I installed GrapheneOS I didn't make a note of it.
20:43:52 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "download that script, save it as"> ok, I think I downloaded it...
20:44:01 <TheJollyRoger> My phone has updated a few times since.
20:44:30 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: ok. Rename it to prepare-elementary.sh
20:45:50 <TheJollyRoger> The command to set it to an executable is "chmod u+x [filename]" with the path to prepare-elementary.sh instead of [filename]. So if you've downloaded it to /home/patriot--os/Downloads/prepare-elementary.sh that's where it'll be.
20:46:06 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "fire-water56: ok. Rename it to p"> Ok, I renamed it. Should I scan the document for the rm -rf or send bitcoin.... stuff?
20:46:42 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: Yes. Make sure there's nothing in there that looks malicious. Never run any script from the internet you get from strangers that you don't trust without having a good look over it first.
20:47:03 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "fire-water56: Yes. Make sure the"> Ok, thank you. I will search it now.
20:47:22 <TheJollyRoger> If that script executes successfully, it should tell you in plain English what you need to do.
20:48:16 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "If that script executes successf"> Ok, I scanned the document and nothing appeared. It should be safe then.
20:49:09 <TheJollyRoger> Great. "chmod u+x" it to give it permission to execute as a program, and run it by typing its relative filename into the command window.
20:49:41 <fire-water56[m]> I opened up a new terminal window and changed the directory to downloads... is this correct?
20:49:42 <fire-water56[m]> patriot--os@patriotos-System-Product-Name:~$ cd downloads

20:50:05 <TheJollyRoger> Remember that Unix is case sensitive: downloads is going to be a different directory than "Downloads"
20:50:13 <fire-water56[m]> oh

21:08:43 <cn3m[m]> anupritaisno1: saw your post about Pixel 4
21:08:44 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: in all honesty, I would probably suggest running one of the supported distributions. Either that or we're going to have to excise fastboot from your system manually.

21:11:41 <TheJollyRoger> Great. It's the correct one.
21:11:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now just run the flash all script
21:11:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> And you're done
21:11:55 <TheJollyRoger> Connect your phone and start it in fastboot.
21:12:05 <TheJollyRoger> Hold your finger on Volume Down and then hold down Power.
21:12:13 <TheJollyRoger> It should boot to fastboot.
21:12:21 <fire-water56[m]> my phone is connected to my computer.... and it is in fastboot mode.
21:12:34 <TheJollyRoger> Ok! Do as anupritaisno1[m] says.
21:12:52 <fire-water56[m]> I should literally just run the flash all command?
21:12:56 <TheJollyRoger> You'll need to unzip the sargo-factory
21:13:11 <TheJollyRoger> the sargo-factory zip file, and then run the flash-all.sh command contained in there.

21:14:12 <TheJollyRoger> fire-water56[m]: you'll need to unzip the sargo-factory zip file first and cd into the directory it unpacks.
21:14:25 <TheJollyRoger> the flash-all.sh script is contained in there.
21:15:52 <fire-water56[m]> would the command be: unzip sargo-factory-2020.06.02.02.zip

21:17:31 <TheJollyRoger> So once that command starts running I'll tell you what to do.
21:17:43 <TheJollyRoger> You'll get to a screen that says "fastbootd" with blue text.
21:17:55 <fire-water56[m]> I ran it and stuff is going on....
21:17:59 <TheJollyRoger> Once the flash all script finishes, your phone will end up in fastbootd.
21:18:23 <TheJollyRoger> ONCE you get to fastbootd, you're going to want to use the volume keys to scroll to "restart to bootloader" and that will get you back to fastboot.
21:18:24 <fire-water56[m]> I'm in hte fastbootd
21:18:37 <TheJollyRoger> Ok. At this point, you will want to lock.

21:19:17 <fire-water56[m]> Ok I'm at the fast boot mode... just run the fastboot flashing lock command then?
21:19:24 <TheJollyRoger> Yes.
21:19:38 <TheJollyRoger> Once it completes, use your volume keys to scroll back to "start"
21:20:08 <TheJollyRoger> It's going to tell you (and every time from hereon in, until you reinstall the factory OS in the same way) your device will be loading a different operating system.
21:20:22 <TheJollyRoger> If you see this in yellow text, that's a /good sign/.
21:20:45 <TheJollyRoger> You should see that warning each time you restart your phone.
21:20:59 <TheJollyRoger> If it turns orange and says "Software integrity not guaranteed!" then you should start to worry.
21:21:34 <fire-water56[m]> Now i'm  stuck on the fastboot mode screen.
21:21:41 <TheJollyRoger> Once your phone starts and you get past the launcher, I want you to head over to https://attestation.app/tutorial on your desktop, and read everything there very carefully.
21:21:43 <fire-water56[m]> I hit start and it comes right back to it.
21:22:26 <TheJollyRoger> OK. Save the scrollback in the terminal window. Save it to a .txt file.
21:22:29 <TheJollyRoger> I'm out of time.
21:23:06 <TheJollyRoger> I will return later.

21:23:31 <fire-water56[m]> <TheJollyRoger "OK. Save the scrollback in the t"> Thanks for all the time you spent helping me out.
21:25:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Uhhhhh
21:26:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> You kinda fucked up there
21:26:43 <fire-water56[m]> My phone is in the fasboot mode screen.... locked... but it says no valid slot to boot
21:27:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unlock again
21:27:39 <fire-water56[m]> ok it's unlocked now
21:29:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> You see another zip there?
21:29:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unpack it
21:29:55 <fire-water56[m]> I'm not sure where another zip is?
21:30:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is
21:31:21 <fire-water56[m]> OK. Should I look in my downloads folder for another zip?
21:31:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
21:32:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will be in the same location as the script
21:32:29 <fire-water56[m]> ok
21:33:54 <fire-water56[m]> I opened up a new terminal window. I'm back in my Downloads folder and this is what I have.

21:44:46 <fire-water56[m]> I don't know why I'm having such a difficult time with this. I think I really bit off more than I can chew. I'm going to take a break for a couple hours and try again. Thank you everyone for the help.
21:50:06 <aeonsolution[m]> fire-water56: it just takes time and patience, if you veer off from the instructions on the website; issues will usually occur
22:10:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> fire-water56: cd sargo-
22:10:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> It'll be there
