00:00:58 <komsiassa[m]> strcat: would you mind naming a few other security researchers people could follow? As I and lot of other people arent security researchers ourself, it's  very hard to be picky about our sources.
00:00:58 <komsiassa[m]> Like Googling around recommends Linux for privacy and security which you have said probably is a worse choice for a lot of people. Or that Firefox is the most secure and private browser.
00:00:58 <komsiassa[m]> Other sources would be very welcome or places to get info. Thanks in advance
00:01:56 <komsiassa[m]> Searching around makes Firefox sound like the most private and secure browser. But as you have stated a few times, it isnt**

00:08:11 <cn3m[m]> only who Daniel follows and of course who they retweet
00:08:31 <strcat[m]> komsiassa: I mean, where do you hear that stuff? I don't see any real information security / privacy researchers saying that
00:08:59 <strcat[m]> you're getting info from social media, software license religious zealots and fanboys of various software
00:09:01 <strcat[m]> not experts
00:09:23 <strcat[m]> getting info on privacy from reddit is like getting news from facebook
00:09:50 <cn3m[m]> Most experts agree that outside of security through obscurity(which is only security for grandparents). Linux is quite bad. Desktop security in general, but mostly Linux

00:11:44 <strcat[m]> I don't see it
00:11:51 <strcat[m]> stop getting info from social media
00:12:10 <strcat[m]> if you don't know how to find reliable sources of info fix that problem
00:12:45 <komsiassa[m]> <strcat[m] "stop getting info from social me"> Well, i'm not doing so. Else I wouldn't be here and use what you have recommend. I'm not like the people think that anti-virus will turn your PC into Fort Knox
00:14:06 <cn3m[m]> Linux security tends to come from inaccuracies like CVE counting or malware counting. Both of which are bullshit from people who have a fundamental misunderstanding of how coding works.
00:14:07 <cn3m[m]> CVEs are highly inconsistent. For example a reputable company like Google or Apple will report virtually every flaw as a CVE even internal bugs. Something not reputable like Debian will report a few percent and almost nothing found internally
00:16:20 <strcat[m]> Linux looks pretty bad if you go by CVE counting lol, and that's with upstream being against getting CVEs
00:16:24 <strcat[m]> so only external researchers get CVEs
00:16:34 <strcat[m]> and they even try to cover up security fixes as official policy
00:16:51 <strcat[m]> official upstream policy is covering up security bugs for the Linux kernel
00:17:03 <komsiassa[m]> Is sites like privacytools.io  recommended or is it just people not knowing what they talk about too?
00:17:06 <strcat[m]> and CVE counting just shows how stupid and ignorant people are
00:17:18 <cn3m[m]> Malware counts only effect those not tech savvy enough to be careful with what they install. My grandma is safer on elementaryos or something since she can't even run TeamViewer or download extensions without jumping into the terminal. That isn't security that through obscurity. It doesn't help anyone that is tech savvy
00:17:35 <cn3m[m]> <komsiassa[m] "Is sites like privacytools.io  r"> Oh they know and will admit it is not as secure, that is not a priority for them
00:18:14 <komsiassa[m]> <cn3m[m] "Oh they know and will admit it i"> What is a priority for them then? No telemetry services?
00:18:36 <JTL> cn3m[m]: I'm pretty sure Win10 has some binary whitelisting stuff
00:18:51 <cn3m[m]> <strcat[m] "and CVE counting just shows how "> Someone's using CVE counting is the #1 marker that they don't know anything useful on security
00:19:46 <cn3m[m]> <komsiassa[m] "What is a priority for them then"> Yes and open source. Neither offer privacy if there is no meaningful security
00:20:09 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has all the no telemetry and open source you could want. It wouldn't matter if it wasn't so secure. A strong foundation is more important
00:22:20 <strcat[m]> open source doesn't make something magically more private or secure as people seem to think
00:22:22 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much sense
00:22:24 <strcat[m]> doesn't work that way
00:22:33 <strcat[m]> and closed source doesn't mean it can't be audited/inspected anyway

00:33:31 <strcat[m]> you're interpreting what I said in a really weird way
00:33:34 <thejoker11[m]> You can't access the code of non open-source softwares, that will require a lot of work to know how really it works
00:33:35 <strcat[m]> the topic wasn't iOS anyway
00:33:44 <strcat[m]> thejoker11: not true
00:33:47 <strcat[m]> btw what did I just say
00:34:06 <komsiassa[m]> <strcat[m] "you're interpreting what I said "> Probably because i'm not that techy and lack knowledge on the overall subject
00:35:20 <strcat[m]> are you telling me you fully understand the Linux kernel code because it's open source
00:35:36 <strcat[m]> but you can't understand simple early boot chain code because it's only available as arm64 assembly?
00:35:37 <strcat[m]> makes no sense
00:36:23 <thejoker11[m]> <strcat[m] "thejoker11: not true"> It's by definition proprietary
00:37:03 <cn3m[m]> Oh guys it is simple. You own the hardware on which the instructions happen. Any client side code is readable in some form
00:37:23 <strcat[m]> thejoker11: not sure what that has to do with anything
00:37:27 <strcat[m]> thejoker11: again, what did I say above
00:38:03 <thejoker11[m]> The security and/or privacy of any software depends on the quality of its code, which is irrelevant with being open source or not; it is again a way of transparency
00:38:04 <cn3m[m]> Any code base of the size of an OS or Browser is too big for any person to understand
00:38:16 <cn3m[m]> you have guarantees of nothing

01:06:48 <cn3m[m]> it isn't a priority
01:06:52 <cn3m[m]> anyone can work on it though
01:06:56 <aeonsolution[m]> google play sevices or stubs like (microg) don't lineup with the goals of GrapheneOS, if you would like that added to the OS you would need to do it yourself or pay for your own developers to do that; CalyxOS supports mircoG
01:07:19 <cn3m[m]> <unknown01234[m] "NSA is a little to much but I kn"> that is just not true. Cellebrite can't break a modern iPhone or Pixel running GrapheneOS
01:07:26 <j-james[m]> i believe i meant the fallback, yes
01:07:30 <cn3m[m]> for know
01:07:34 <cn3m[m]> or they would advertise it
01:07:52 <cn3m[m]> iOS and GrapheneOS have both made this incredibly hard recently
01:08:05 <cn3m[m]> though if you are really worried just turn off or reboot your device
01:09:10 <cn3m[m]> Cellebrite has to find an exploit while the system is running essentially. GrapheneOS and iOS both deny the USB vector(huge) and hardened what little attack surface is left. It is not easy at all. If your device is off between HSMs it is almost game over
01:09:12 <cn3m[m]> though on the other hand
01:09:22 <cn3m[m]> if they wait long enough and keep the device alive
01:09:37 <cn3m[m]> eventually they may be able to find a flaw that works
01:09:47 <cn3m[m]> if you are really worried though never leave your device on and unattended
01:09:52 <cn3m[m]> rebooted is fine
01:10:05 <cn3m[m]> but yeah I am not worried about Cellebrite against my GrapheneOS phone
01:11:10 <bonerdose[m]> I convinced my gf to convert to grapheneOS but she refuses to have a passcode
01:11:38 <cn3m[m]> pin + biometrics is probably fine for 99% of people
01:11:46 <unknown01234[m]> <cn3m[m] "that is just not true. Cellebrit"> https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/02/26/government-can-access-any-apple-iphone-cellebrite/#d74f7b7667a0
01:12:01 <cn3m[m]> the hardware rate limiter in the Titan M means a 4 Digit PIN should be safe for 650 years
01:12:06 <bonerdose[m]> <cn3m[m] "pin + biometrics is probably fin"> Easily brute forced though correct?
01:12:10 <cn3m[m]> the biometrics time out after 48 hours
01:12:10 <MRK[m]> <cn3m[m] "pin + biometrics is probably fin"> Biometrics are less secure, right?
01:12:18 <cn3m[m]> makes it hard to make a fake
01:12:20 <cn3m[m]> <MRK[m] "Biometrics are less secure, righ"> no
01:12:29 <cn3m[m]> biometrics protect from shoulder surfing and cctv
01:12:33 <MRK[m]> Hoe
01:12:36 <MRK[m]> How
01:12:47 <cn3m[m]> probably a more real world threat than making a convincing bypass in under 48 hours
01:12:51 <bonerdose[m]> In the US you cannot be compelled to provide a pascode but you can be compelled for biometrics
01:13:05 <bonerdose[m]> Legally
01:13:09 <cn3m[m]> so reboot your phone in a sticky situation
01:13:13 <cn3m[m]> or use lockdown
01:13:18 <cn3m[m]> in the US it is very mixed
01:13:28 <cn3m[m]> the last ruling is your can't be forced to unlock your phone ever
01:13:56 <cn3m[m]> For 99% of people a PIN + Biometrics is more than enough on GrapheneOS
01:14:00 <cn3m[m]> it might even be ideal
01:14:28 <cn3m[m]> the randomized PIN means even at first boot you can't shoulder surf effectively and the biometrics of course takes care of that
01:14:40 <cn3m[m]> the timeout on biometrics and ease of which you can reboot or use lockdown
01:15:00 <cn3m[m]> and the hardware rate limiter making a fully random 4 digit PIN take 635 years to break
01:15:19 <cn3m[m]> yeah fully random 4 digit PIN and biometrics are good
01:15:49 <MRK[m]> Apple also force people to use bluetooth to connect to device instead of just wire which is very weak security. If Apple cares both security and privacy why on earth they ditch headphone jack.
01:16:29 <jonah__> if that was a huge concern you could also just use the lightning port
01:16:38 <cn3m[m]> a hardware rate limiter bypass is extremely unlikely. The SEP has gone undefeated for 7 years. No firmware decryption and partial compromises don't count. The Titan M will hold on
01:17:03 <cn3m[m]> <MRK[m] "Apple also force people to use b"> bluetooth is not weak for the device really it actually has security and privacy advantages that are worth noting over cable. Generally it is better to use bluetooth imo
01:17:36 <cn3m[m]> though apple has a sane usb setup much like grapheneos
01:18:06 <MRK[m]> <jonah__ "if that was a huge concern you c"> Nah, I don't like that kind of tech. Apple suck sometimes at deciding.

01:19:37 <cn3m[m]> Daniel linked this before
01:20:03 <IxquickOG[m]> .
01:20:21 <MRK[m]> If bluetooth is secure then why we can't put password on a Bluetooth connection?
01:20:46 <cn3m[m]> bluetooth is generally a safer bet with much less attack surface than USB and the risks are usually with outdated device connecting to your device and their security. The security of a sound phone(GrapheneOS Pixel or iPhone) is fine with Bluetooth
01:21:02 <cn3m[m]> <MRK[m] "If bluetooth is secure then why "> read the linked article and draw your own conclusions

01:32:54 <LinusSexTips[m]> looks pretty sus
01:33:08 <LinusSexTips[m]> why are my messages so delayed
01:33:34 <cn3m[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "the only thing I dont like about"> it shows your fingerprint
01:33:41 <cn3m[m]> which is pretty helpful
01:34:00 <LinusSexTips[m]> no not for me personally, border control
01:34:15 <LinusSexTips[m]> though I guess if you do it before its not a problem
01:34:23 <alzxjm[m]> <nikitalita[m] "about to pull the trigger on buy"> Pixel 4 XL here. Works great.
01:34:26 <unknown01234[m]> <cn3m[m] "that is out of date"> Yes but McAfee also said he could do it. It was up to the iPhone x model the newer models I have no idea just checking the waters
01:34:30 <nikitalita[m]> cool
01:34:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> I usually power down my devices first, but sometimes they ask me to turn them on to prove they work
01:34:49 <nikitalita[m]> alzxjm: does face unlocking work yet or nah
01:35:07 <unknown01234[m]> <nikitalita[m] "about to pull the trigger on buy"> I am and I'm pretty happy about it
01:35:08 <cn3m[m]> <unknown01234[m] "Yes but McAfee also said he coul"> XS was a huge leap. That is why I said modern iPhone. You know how the Pixel 3 was a huge leap over the 2? This was a very similar leap
01:35:09 <alzxjm[m]> Yep. Face Locking works normally.
01:35:14 <nikitalita[m]> cool
01:35:18 <alzxjm[m]> Haha. Face Unlock*
01:35:18 <nikitalita[m]> imma do it
01:35:40 <cn3m[m]> I wouldn't trust McAfee as an expert source either
01:35:48 <cn3m[m]> the company or the man
01:36:04 <LinusSexTips[m]> well depends, is it McAfee or the Chad John McAfee himself?
01:36:08 <alzxjm[m]> The 90 Hz display is a little flickery at low brightness but I think some people here fixed it with adb commands and forcing 60 Hz. But I'm not sure. I just ignore it. You could probably search for it.
01:36:21 <j-james[m]> didn't mcafee disown mcafee
01:36:21 <unknown01234[m]> <LinusSexTips[m] "the only thing I dont like about"> I feel you on that
01:36:27 <LinusSexTips[m]>  * well depends, is it McAfee or the chad, John McAfee himself?
01:37:19 <alzxjm[m]> I like 90 Hz most of the time so I don't mind.
01:37:20 <cn3m[m]> there is a lot of FUD of people wanting to claim they hacked iPhones or inflate it to boost their careers. Some cons will even flat out lie. ZecOps with the Mail vulnerability was a farce and Apple went so far as to say it was not exploitable. They had every opportunity to prove Apple wrong, but no they were lying
01:37:29 <cn3m[m]> As Pixels become more common the same will happen
01:37:56 <cn3m[m]> there is a tremendous amount of FUD in this industry
01:38:28 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> <nikitalita[m] "about to pull the trigger on buy"> Pixel 4XL here, works great
01:38:37 <unknown01234[m]> <cn3m[m] "the company or the man"> Hhh
01:39:38 <aeonsolution[m]> the space is full of FUD, fearmongering, and whataboutisms
01:39:52 <nikitalita[m]> just curious, is there a "getting started contributing" guide? there are developers guidelines, but I don't see like a "here's what you have to check out and here's what you need to do to build", etc.
01:40:03 <aeonsolution[m]> just use proper opsec and research your threat models
01:40:31 <aeonsolution[m]> you'll find very few security projects as transparent as GrapheneOS
01:40:36 <aeonsolution[m]> you can all validate your fears
01:40:45 <aeonsolution[m]> and doubts if you should so please
01:40:53 <aeonsolution[m]> use reverse engineering tools
01:41:02 <aeonsolution[m]> make proof of concepts
01:41:16 <aeonsolution[m]> all the source code is there for you
01:41:31 <aeonsolution[m]> the project is not magic and doesn't claim to be
01:41:36 <aeonsolution[m]> its a security hardened project
01:41:42 <bonerdose[m]> What does FUD mean
01:41:45 <aeonsolution[m]> with extra patches ontop of AOSP
01:41:56 <aeonsolution[m]> fear, uncertainty, and doubt
01:42:14 <bonerdose[m]> Thanks
01:42:19 <aeonsolution[m]> with a hardened browser and a bunch of other amazing features
01:42:29 <aeonsolution[m]> that are on the website
01:42:30 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> <aeonsolution[m] "the space is full of FUD, fearmo"> There are FUDs everywhere and for just about everything. It's really up to you to do your own research and come to your own conclusions by combining that with your instincts and anyone's opinion / information you decide to trust. I personally never really trusted or liked Apple to much.
01:44:07 <aeonsolution[m]> i dont like Apple products but i can still say it does good security out of the box
01:44:08 <bonerdose[m]> Also if you are 99.999999999% of people the NSA is not after you and you don't need that level of privacy
01:44:38 <aeonsolution[m]> those two things dont have to be mutually exclusive
01:44:57 <bonerdose[m]> Yeah I was trying to make a point on threat model
01:45:16 <aeonsolution[m]> i was talking not using apple and saying they do good security
01:45:34 <aeonsolution[m]> i get your point tho
01:46:16 <bonerdose[m]> I have gone too far down the privacy rabbit hole during adderall binges ngl
01:48:12 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> <aeonsolution[m] "i dont like Apple products but i"> Yea but they're still into machine learning and AI which means that their almost surely hoarding as much user data as they can get. In the coming age of ML most algorithms and code will actually be publicly available. The difference making my AI better than your AI will not be the algorithms, but the data. I personally don't like being data mined for free.
01:50:45 <aeonsolution[m]> im not disagreeing, thats why i dont bring up privacy concerns when i talk about apple products.
01:51:26 <refragable[m]> <nikitalita[m] "just curious, is there a "gettin"> Here are some ways to help GrapheneOS:
01:52:07 <aeonsolution[m]> eyy, it be me
01:52:24 <aeonsolution[m]> thanks refragable
01:56:09 <aeonsolution[m]> is there something you are specifically interested in nikitalita?
01:56:27 <aeonsolution[m]> if you have a pixel 3 family device you can start helping today!
02:00:52 <aeonsolution[m]> pixel 3 family being (Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 3a XL)
02:03:33 <aeonsolution[m]> these are the prerequisites you need to help with testing (https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies)
02:03:45 <JTL> https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/google-finally-announces-the-pixel-4a-for-349/
02:04:03 <aeonsolution[m]> if you get stuck at any point, you can reach out to me and i can help you out
02:04:06 <JTL> As expected, it's just the confirmation what's been circulating for awhile...
02:04:46 <cn3m[m]> The Nord is dead imo the SE and 4a smashed it badly
02:04:56 <cn3m[m]> though different markets
02:05:23 <JTL> ^
02:05:25 <JTL> Agreed
02:08:01 <aeonsolution[m]> the pixel 4a should have 5G already :p
02:09:03 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: meh. I think 5G is overhyped
02:09:08 <JTL> Agree to disagree?
02:10:24 <aeonsolution[m]> im sort of indifferent, it just makes you do a second take if someone was already gearing to get the Pixel 4a
02:10:31 <aeonsolution[m]> its just another thing to weigh
02:10:45 <JTL> fair
02:11:10 <aeonsolution[m]> and thats my dilemma now lol
02:11:30 <JTL> I don't see it being that useful for practice. The extra bandwidth seems to be very dependent on line of sight with the base station, else it's just souped up 4G
02:11:51 <JTL> and given the high frequencies used for higher bandwidth, they need more base stations/microcells
02:13:29 <JTL> er "in practice" rather
02:14:53 <aeonsolution[m]> dont tell consumers that! what do you mean we have to tell our government to get telecomms to do their job
02:15:21 <aeonsolution[m]> i agree with you completely
02:16:12 <JTL> Thank you
02:16:14 <aeonsolution[m]> we'll just have to wait and see
02:16:33 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> Getlambs.com is relevant
03:15:23 <Ninja99> Hello, just got IRC set up for this, so appologies if I'm not using it correctly, but if anyone is online here, I'm wondering if anyone knows how/if wearOS works with GrapheneOS
03:16:16 <Ninja99> I've heard that it relies quite heavily on google services and that it isn't supported by microG, so I'd have to install google services on any rom I'd be using in order to use wearos
03:16:17 <cn3m[m]> <Ninja99 "Hello, just got IRC set up for t"> it doesn
03:16:23 <cn3m[m]> you can try asteroid OS
03:16:29 <cn3m[m]> if you wear watch supports i
03:17:04 <Ninja99> Ok, thanks for the suggestion! Also, do you know if samsung watches work with grapheneos, or do they have similar dependancies
03:17:45 <cn3m[m]> samsung watches are generally fully independent if you want them to be
03:17:59 <cn3m[m]> which is probably ideally for privacy you don't even need a phone
03:19:10 <Ninja99> Great, thanks! Aside from those two options (WearOS and Samsung watches) are there any other android-compatible smartwatch OS's that you'd say are anywhere near either of those two in terms of features? Otherwise I'm going to look into some of the samsung stuff I think
03:19:39 <prion_disease[m]> AsteroidOS is open source
03:20:14 <Ninja99> Yeah it's definitely the gold standard in terms of privacy and such, but my watch isn't compatible with it, for one
03:20:29 <cn3m[m]> eh you probably want a Samsung watch. Or an Apple Watch if you have an old iPhone around.
03:20:29 <cn3m[m]> The GadgetBridge devices are mixed imo
03:20:59 <prion_disease[m]> Apple watch is objectively the most optimized smart watch on the marlet
03:21:04 <prion_disease[m]> * Apple watch is objectively the most optimized smart watch on the market
03:21:32 <cn3m[m]> best privacy controls too, local only or e2ee
03:21:54 <cn3m[m]> the local data is also encrypted
03:22:02 <cn3m[m]> which is non existent on alternatives iirc
03:22:17 <cn3m[m]> if you have an old iPhone laying around pair the Apple Watch with it and bring that around
03:22:23 <Ninja99> Ok! I'll take a look at gadgetbridge too. I agree with you about the apple watch, but I just don't want to get an iPhone tbh, too attached to android
03:22:32 <Ninja99> Never had an iphone so...
03:22:40 <Ninja99> Thanks for the help!
03:22:59 <cn3m[m]> GadgetBridge is just an app that works with many watches
03:23:12 <renlord> pls stay on topic.
03:23:15 <cn3m[m]> AsteroidOS, Mi, and Amazebit and more
03:23:20 <renlord> grapheneos-related discussion only please.
03:23:30 <Ninja99> ah ok! Sorry about the topic drifting, thanks for the help though
03:39:02 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Not sure why the VPN lockdown issue is closed, albeit the commit on the "fix" is still reversed
03:45:18 <prion_disease[m]> Why is this matrix not e2ee
03:45:56 <JTL> Beacuse it's public?
03:46:01 <JTL> Because*
03:48:33 <camoufrage[m]> Yeah, makes no senae
03:48:44 <camoufrage[m]> * Yeah, makes no sense
03:49:40 <camoufrage[m]> Are there any public chats with e2ee? Lol
03:51:16 <cn3m[m]> <camoufrage[m] "Are there any public chats with "> no that would be ridiculous
03:51:52 <prion_disease[m]> Oh lmao
03:52:21 <cn3m[m]> why encrypt something anyone can join and log?
03:52:25 <cn3m[m]> it hurts performance for no reason
03:52:31 <camoufrage[m]> exactly
03:52:44 <camoufrage[m]> I was gonna say, the performance implication would be absurd
05:24:34 <charuto> you guys have any thoughts on simplemobiletools?
05:25:24 <zzz1> they seem alright. The only app i actually use from them is the Gallery one
05:25:36 <zzz1> Works like a charm, no complaints
05:33:11 <eqex[m]> Using almost all of them (calendar, gallery, file browser...) they are easy to use, configutable and well... simple
05:33:41 <zzz1> I tried using their calendar but i prefer Etar for that
05:35:20 <eqex[m]> Depends on your preference of course.
05:36:23 <zzz1> indeed
05:40:59 <camoufrage[m]> <charuto "you guys have any thoughts on si"> Simple Notes, Simple Gallery, and Simple Calendar are the absolute best
05:42:01 <camoufrage[m]> Calculator, Contacts, and Clock I use stock because they're inferior
05:42:16 <camoufrage[m]> And the messaging app at this point should just be Signal
05:42:42 <eqex[m]> Btw (i know its offtopic but i have to ask) what is a good privacy and security focused desktop os i assumed its linux, but both cn3m and strcpy suggested otherwise so im puzzled...
05:42:55 <renlord> stop
05:43:15 <renlord> discussion of S&P-focused desktop os is offtopic
05:44:06 <eqex[m]> Ok, sorry

05:44:30 <zzz1> how do PMs work on the matrix-irc bridge? if i /msg eqex will it show up publicly? or will it not even send?
05:44:56 <refragable[m]> it goes into a private matrix room
05:45:06 <refragable[m]> well... invite-only matrix room
05:45:10 <refragable[m]> but off topic
05:45:23 <zzz1> yeah, understood
05:46:15 <eqex[m]> Hm cant seem to open provided link with element....
05:48:02 <eqex[m]> <zzz1 "how do PMs work on the matrix-ir"> I think you can add me as a contact
05:48:34 <zzz1> I'm on IRC. we can move our conversation to #grapheneos-offtopic
05:48:45 <refragable[m]> eqex: try on the web/desktop app. The mobile app doesn't have the "join" feature yet
05:49:16 <eqex[m]> Ok
05:51:01 <sukiyakiwestern> honestly I was too stupid to realize this room was connected through freenode too up to this point
05:51:07 <sukiyakiwestern> Screw matrix, lol
05:51:28 <zzz1> LOL
05:59:52 <renlord> everyone should just use IRC
06:02:22 <sukiyakiwestern> I was sitting around on my (newly Graphene'd) phone, setting up matrix and figuring it all out thinking irc must be dead for these hip new projects
06:03:12 <sukiyakiwestern> but no, that's good. The profile pictures is what really gets me personally
06:04:24 <JTL> lol
08:16:47 <crixtnn[m]> regarding VPN. do I need to install it for every user or only on main? if I make a hotspot would the devices connected to it also connect through the VPN ?
08:30:06 <virgin_eagle[m]> > regarding VPN. do I need to install it for every user or only on main? if I make a hotspot would the devices connected to it also connect through the VPN ?
08:30:06 <virgin_eagle[m]> No. U have to use iptables if u want to share vpn connection

08:54:08 <strcat[m]> this is a new ongoing problem that I recently noticed
08:54:23 <strcat[m]> this is the kind of underhanded stuff that they're up to
08:54:39 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Typing `/join !NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org` on Element app will make you join the offtopic GrapheneOS gc
08:54:55 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Typing `/join !NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org` on Element app will make you join the offtopic GrapheneOS room
09:02:21 <za_warudo-vilfp8> No wonder the wiki seems misleading
09:03:15 <strcat[m]> they stopped publishing source code and just spend their time editing the article to claim source code is still publicly available
09:03:24 <strcat[m]> that's how wikipedia works apparently
09:06:15 <strcat[m]> CEO of the company writing article about their product with a couple friends
09:06:16 <strcat[m]> that's wikipedia
09:06:19 <strcat[m]> that's some real bullshit
09:06:27 <strcat[m]> and gets to use it as a platform to spread his libel
09:06:35 <strcat[m]> and no one cares
09:07:06 <strcat[m]> I hadn't noticed this until it was pointed out to me
09:07:10 <strcat[m]> but it's clear what is happening
09:07:30 <strcat[m]> I really wonder what other underhanded stuff James is up to
09:07:44 <strcat[m]> there is nothing he won't do if he can get away with it
09:08:33 <ruddo[m]> Wikipedia is full of shit.  Anyone who flat out believes whatever Wikipedia says, without checking and vetting the references, is an imbecile.
09:09:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wikipedia is pretty biased too imo
09:10:41 <mmcblk0[m]> Spend time about Wikipedia too, isn't?
09:11:51 <mmcblk0[m]> Spend time about Copperhead and James ...
09:12:42 <strcat[m]> not sure what you mean
09:12:58 <strcat[m]> he's actively waging a war against this project contacting contributors, supporters, partners, etc.
09:13:00 <strcat[m]> filing a bogus lawsuit
09:13:06 <strcat[m]> filing fraudulent tax information to screw me over
09:13:12 <strcat[m]> stealing > $100k of donations
09:13:54 <strcat[m]> it's at the point where I have to spend more time dealing with all this than working on the project and that's not my fault
09:14:51 <strcat[m]> people always ask how they can contribute without being a developer
09:15:13 <strcat[m]> help me figure out how to deal with this scumbag trying to destroy GrapheneOS and completely ruin my life
09:15:17 <strcat[m]> who has spent multiple years abusing me
09:15:55 <strcat[m]> it needs to stop
09:24:15 <zzz1> is there any (more) legal action you can take, if you haven't already?

12:16:25 <enthustic> hello everyone
12:16:26 <RupturedFlesh[m]> Just wanna say thanks to the team here for doing a great job and that GrapheneOS is working great on my Pixel 4 XL 🙂
12:16:51 <enthustic> i would like to report an issue
12:17:15 <enthustic> with pixel 3 : i had some troubles trying to do conference calls
12:17:54 <enthustic> also if i installed aurora store will this help being able to use Microsoft teams
12:21:04 <enthustic> is there off topic graphene os on freenode
12:21:21 <cdesai> yes #grapheneos-offtopic
12:23:09 <Biv[m]> just wanted to say that oidc is supported by matrix now
12:23:10 <Biv[m]> yay!
12:30:54 <enthustic> i searched for it on freenode and told me no channels
12:33:07 <Kruger[m]> Hey Guys
12:35:41 <ruddo[m]> how do I join that room from Matrix?

15:40:32 <textmate[m]> Is buying Pixel 4a the way to go?
15:41:06 <Mythical> I'd like to know too
15:41:27 <justwayne[m]> yeah, that question
15:54:20 <charuto> probably still way too early to expect any sort of grapheneos support
15:55:27 <charuto> "Support for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL is currently experimental, but those along with the upcoming Pixel 4a will become the recommended devices due to longer support and incremental security improvements for the device support code and firmware. "
15:55:37 <charuto> from https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices
15:57:13 <alex-resist> The 4a won't be shipping before october
15:58:17 <ThomCat[m]> August 20th in the states
16:00:01 <alex-resist> Shipping?
16:00:06 <alex-resist> That's interesting
16:02:24 <justwayne[m]> so available at August 20th but takes till October to be shipped?
16:03:22 <alex-resist> Perhaps it differs between regions
16:04:16 <alex-resist> For Germany: pre-orders starting september 10, shipping october 1st
16:04:33 <alex-resist> Btw, is this on-topic for this channel? Apologies if not.
16:06:12 <justwayne[m]> ok that is a bit longer than i expected
16:06:43 <trismous[m]> <alex-resist "The 4a won't be shipping before "> That was for the 5G, wasn't it?
16:07:16 <alex-resist> No, the 5G will be even later
16:07:48 <ruddo[m]> What is the benefit of the 5g?
16:07:57 <justwayne[m]> but won't it be also like 100 euros more?
16:08:44 <alex-resist> 4a 5G will have Android 11 and cost 150€ more. Likely not available before November
16:09:07 <alex-resist> I mean, it's all over the news today, just look it up yourself for your region
16:10:21 <alex-resist> Also I think this is off-topic on this channel.
16:18:12 <dmatrixs[m]> Test test
16:20:39 <dmatrixs[m]> Hey guys. New here and using Element. Do I need to do anything with the identity server setting?
16:23:12 <norbert[17> Nope, it's for the regular 4a.
16:24:01 <norbert[17> At least for Germany.
16:27:22 <hpfr[m]> dmatrixs: the identity server is only for mapping 3rd party identities like email and phone to accounts https://matrix.org/faq/#can-i-run-my-own-identity-server%3F
16:27:40 <hpfr[m]> So I would say leave it at new vector or whatever it is
16:27:57 <hpfr[m]> There are matrix rooms about matrix for these questions btw
16:29:44 <dmatrixs[m]> Thank you so much. 100% new to the platform as of today. I appreciate it
17:22:02 <dmatrixs[m]> I thought for some reason I could change site settings to allow java script from the 'i' in the URL bar but the only permission I see there now is just sound. Am I trippin or can you actually not do this?
17:22:11 <dmatrixs[m]> In Vanadium^
17:28:47 <fomijafi[m]> I believe it's only possible to switch JavaScript on/off globally or by white listing individual sites from the global menu. To use the URL bar the way you  mentioned, I personally have turned to Bromite
17:30:38 <dmatrixs[m]> Got it. Thank you.  I must have totally thought I was on vanadium and not bromite. I'm still having a hard time understanding for myself the strengths of each within graphene. I know the official site still recommend vanadium for security but I don't fully grasp why yet
17:47:28 <Terrel357> Hi guys
18:04:28 <strcat[m]> dmatrixs: because it's more hardened and provides the WebView
18:04:44 <strcat[m]> it's indeed unfortunate that there's a lack of contributors and therefore not much progress on adding the desired features
18:07:57 <dmatrixs[m]> strcatthabk thank you.  this is what I have read as well. Are you able to expand on those points for me a little? I don't know what exactly is more hardened about vanadium and to be honest I don't understand what the webview is either. I'm trying to research both for myself but the reading a little sparse for someone with my background 😕
18:08:13 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <fomijafi[m] "I believe it's only possible to "> If you updated your Vanadium, the Javascript option is on the url site now, which is in parity with Bromite.

18:09:06 <za_warudo-vilfp8> You can update it here ^^
18:09:27 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Make sure to install the Trichrome Library first
18:09:44 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Make sure to update the Trichrome Library first
18:10:08 <dmatrixs[m]> Woah. I thought updates for system came automatically though the OS itself?
18:10:29 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "If you updated your Vanadium, th"> So version 84?
18:10:32 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Of course, and that update should be real soon
18:10:38 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <BlackWinnerYoshi "So version 84?"> Yes.

18:14:27 <refragable[m]> dmatrixs: Did you read the section on web browsing? It gives a good overview https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
18:21:27 <dmatrixs[m]> refragable yes I did. It's just a little general. I'm trying to learn more about what's behind the scenes but I dont have the strongest background on the tech. I'm dying to learn more though xD
18:26:09 <dmatrixs[m]> So I would  install  TrichromeLibrary.apk and TrichromeWebView.apk before TrichromeChrome.apk?
18:26:28 <cdesai> Library first, then any, doesn't matter
18:26:45 <cdesai> the others won't install before you install the library anyway.
18:29:34 <dmatrixs[m]> Neat thank you
18:35:40 <strcat[m]> there will be an update in the next 24h
18:35:42 <strcat[m]> with the new Vanadium
18:35:48 <strcat[m]> you can install it earlier if you really want
18:36:08 <strcat[m]> if we had our app update system implemented already there would be automatic out-of-band updates to Vanadium
18:36:18 <strcat[m]> atm the updates to it are shipped only with OS updates
18:36:27 <strcat[m]> and we don't put out an OS update immediately after each Vanadium update
18:36:38 <strcat[m]> so they get shipped in the usually 2x monthly OS updates
18:36:44 <strcat[m]> so it can be delayed by a week or two
18:37:00 <strcat[m]> which is less than the Chrome updates are delayed by Google for staged rollouts anyway
18:37:36 <strcat[m]> Chrome is built from the Chromium source tree with added code
18:37:53 <strcat[m]> so the stable releases are the same but they have assorted extra code / configuration
18:38:12 <strcat[m]> anyway they don't just immediately ship the new stable release to everyone on day one
18:38:23 <strcat[m]> they do a series of releases and each release is shipped to a broader set of people
18:38:33 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I think the delay is also helpful when they sometimes pull releases
18:38:36 <strcat[m]> so it takes weeks for a major release to be pushed out
18:38:52 <strcat[m]> and enterprises can configure it to avoid getting the early staged rollout
18:38:59 <cdesai> noticed it once recently, I think that was maybe 83?

18:40:43 <strcat[m]> Stable Refresh
18:40:44 <strcat[m]> A stable refresh is defined as a release of a new Chrome build outside of the normal release schedule to fix critical bugs detected during the stable rollout. Except for extremely critical issues (e.g. security or privacy escalations), a Chrome stable refresh should not be pushed more than 2 weeks after the initial build has been released to the public. In this case, we should consider punting any detected production
18:40:44 <strcat[m]> issues to the next release.
18:41:57 <dmatrixs[m]> Thank you many times over
18:42:57 <dmatrixs[m]> So realistically in what circumstances would I prefer bromite over vanadium? Feel free to shut me up if that's the right answer too
18:44:00 <refragable[m]> dmatrixs: If you want to see what is happening behind the scenes, examine the Vanadium patches and look up the documentation for the changes (e.g. What `-ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero` does etc) https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Vanadium/tree/10/patches
18:44:01 <alzxjm[m]> dmatrixs: > Using Vanadium is highly recommended. Bromite is a solid alternative and is the only other browser we recommend. Bromite provides integrated ad-blocking and more advanced anti-fingerprinting. For now, Vanadium is more focused on security hardening and Bromite is more focused on anti-fingerprinting.
18:45:29 <prion_disease[m]> What's wrong with Firefox  based browsers like for?
18:45:43 <prion_disease[m]> * What's wrong with Firefox  based browsers like tor?
18:46:58 <eqex[m]> Firefox doesnt have website isolation"sandbox"
18:47:07 * dmatrixs[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/UjdABAJRMaJCOoMrTbschqvI >
18:47:27 <dmatrixs[m]> I'm completely stumped by it
18:47:40 <strcat[m]> sounds like their release is broken
18:48:09 <strcat[m]> apps aren't allowed to run executables from their data directory anymore as of Android 10 if they target Android 10+
18:48:21 <strcat[m]> so sounds like they targeting API 29 but did not support it properly
18:48:33 <strcat[m]> and didn't test on Android 10
18:48:41 <strcat[m]> that's not how an executable / library is supposed to be shipped
18:48:41 <dmatrixs[m]> Wouldn't a lot of people be reporting the same issue? I was assuming something was graphene related
18:48:44 <strcat[m]> it's not a GrapheneOS issue
18:48:56 <strcat[m]> dmatrixs: perhaps they are
18:48:56 <dmatrixs[m]> Hmm
18:49:00 <strcat[m]> where are you getting Orbot
18:49:03 <strcat[m]> I suggest getting software via Aurora Store
18:49:09 <strcat[m]> not outdated versions via F-Droid
18:49:18 <dmatrixs[m]> Interesting
18:49:27 <dmatrixs[m]> I did try via both and same deal
18:49:38 <dmatrixs[m]> I thought aurora store was a no no lol
18:49:49 <cdesai> tor browser is standalone now, doesn't need orbot
18:49:51 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <strcat[m] "not outdated versions via F-Droi"> Um, Orbot is up to date on F-Droid, at least for me
18:50:13 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/issues/302
18:50:29 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <cdesai "tor browser is standalone now, d"> It was called Orfox, but it's dead
18:50:34 <strcat[m]> doesn't work on Android 10 you presumably need to use a beta version of it with a fix
18:50:53 <strcat[m]> that suite of apps is poorly maintained
18:51:15 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <strcat[m] "that suite of apps is poorly mai"> What suite of apps? The Guardian Project ones?
18:51:16 <strcat[m]> Black Winner Yoshi: doesn't seem up-to-date as in there are newer betas and the latest betas are the only ones that work afaik
18:51:23 <strcat[m]> Black Winner Yoshi: yes
18:51:39 <cdesai> BlackWinnerYoshi: that's different, I'm talking about https://www.torproject.org/download/#android
18:51:49 <cdesai> this works just fine here on CalyxOS
18:51:55 <strcat[m]> the issue in this case is the app was updated to API level 29 without actually testing it on a device supporting API level 29 (i.e. Android 10)
18:51:59 <strcat[m]> and it was not fixed to work on it
18:52:06 <strcat[m]> afaik they have newer beta releases fixing the issue
18:52:31 <cdesai> 68.10.1 is what I have here, org.torproject.torbrowser
18:52:58 <strcat[m]> for Orbot, look at that issue
18:53:03 <strcat[m]> you need to use a newer beta
18:53:07 <dmatrixs[m]> Yea just confirmed still same issue from aurora
18:53:09 <cdesai> that's for the guardian project fdroid repo. playstore has 68.11.0, slightly newer.
18:53:13 <strcat[m]> what you're using is broken on Android 10 because they updated API level and didn't test it
18:54:00 <cdesai> working Orbot / org.torpoject.android here is 16.3.0-RC-1-tor-0.4.2.7
18:56:56 <alex-resist> I'm using Orbot from F-Droid (16.3.0-RC-1-tor-0.4.2.7) and it's working fine. Can confirm.
18:58:37 <dmatrixs[m]> on android 10? Orbot just gets stuck connecting for me too
18:58:57 <alex-resist> I'm on current Graphene
18:59:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alex-resist "I'm using Orbot from F-Droid (16"> Same
18:59:52 <dmatrixs[m]> Wtf am I doing wrong then xD
19:00:06 <alex-resist> What is your exact setup?
19:01:53 <alex-resist> Here: current Graphene on Pixel 3a, Orbot from F-Droid (Guardian Project repository). Works fine. Tor Browser is also working fine
19:03:01 <strcat[m]> clear the Orbot app data
19:03:06 <strcat[m]> you probably installed the broken version 1st
19:03:22 <strcat[m]> maybe it can't recover from extracting the executable to the data directory when it's not supposed to do that
19:03:42 <strcat[m]> they might have only fixed it for fresh installs of the app and the problem is still there for an existing one
19:04:46 <dmatrixs[m]> <alex-resist "What is your exact setup?"> Current graphene on pixel 4 xl. Installed from aurora store but after uninstalling from fdroid. Going to clear app data now
19:05:42 <alex-resist> Perhaps some weird permissions because you installed it from different stores?
19:06:04 <alex-resist> Correct me if that doesn't make sense
19:06:36 <dmatrixs[m]> <strcat[m] "clear the Orbot app data"> Total noob question but this means deleting the associated files from my data folder?
19:07:03 <prion_disease[m]> Why is it that apps on aurora store are always more up to date than f droid
19:07:56 <alex-resist> Orbot in Aurora is atm actually older than the F-Droid version
19:08:08 <alex-resist> In Aurora it's 16.2.0-RC-1
19:08:12 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <prion_disease[m] "Why is it that apps on aurora st"> F-Droid's main repository is kind of finnicky, or something
19:08:45 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alex-resist "In Aurora it's 16.2.0-RC-1"> Unless it's because this is the stable version, not beta
19:10:15 <alex-resist> Afaik Orbot always has beta or RC in the version name if it's beta or RC. So if it says 16.2.0-RC-1 vs. 16.3.0-RC-1, they are both not stable
19:11:24 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <alex-resist "Afaik Orbot always has beta or R"> I guess Tor itself isn't stable either, since it's on 0.x and not on 1.x, but what do I know?
19:11:58 <alex-resist> You could also compare release dates. Orbot in Aurora came out May 4th, Orbot in F-Droid came out June 2nd.
19:13:04 <alex-resist> So going from the F-Droid version to the Aurora version was in fact a downgrade
19:13:17 <BlackWinnerYoshi> Oh, and speaking of Tor, .onion v2 is getting depreciated. Just saying in case you have one.
19:26:24 <dmatrixs[m]> <strcat[m] "you probably installed the broke"> Cleared app data for Tor and orbot through storage settings and reinstalled the most recent versions of each. Tor from aurora and orbot from fdroid. Same issue still
19:29:06 <alex-resist> Have you tried running Tor Browser on its own? Without Orbot installed?
19:32:13 <dmatrixs[m]> <alex-resist "Have you tried running Tor Brows"> Yep. All roads lead to the same error for me
19:33:34 <alex-resist> Sorry, I could only speculate at this point. Probably not helpful.
19:45:20 <dmatrixs[m]> Im open to anything at this point heh
21:00:55 <yahoje8886[m]> is the new pixel 4a gonna work ?
21:02:29 <SchismXL8> <yahoje8886[m] "is the new pixel 4a gonna work ?"> In time.
21:48:24 <dazinism> dmatrixs: think the universal version of the latest orbot from github works
21:48:26 <dazinism> https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases
21:49:53 <dazinism> Its signed with the same signature as the versions from Play Store and Guardian Project Fdroid repo
21:50:23 <dazinism> So can update from an older version from one of those sources
22:59:01 <Th0mas_> Has anybody sucessfully used the backup feature and can tell me how the restore works? Nextcloud does not work, since market is not installed. Restoring from device does not work, since I have no way of copying my .SeedVaultAndroidBackup folder onto it. Restoring from USB does not work, since it complains "Needs to be plugged in" even though it is.
22:59:01 <Th0mas_> I am on a Pixel 3 if that matters. (No important data in the backup yet, wanted to test it before relying on it)
23:00:46 <cdesai> Th0mas_: usb should work, does the usb drive normally work?
23:01:06 <cdesai> (i.e. did you backup via seedvault to that drive, or did you copy it there?
23:01:40 <Th0mas_> Hm its an external SSD, maybe thats the problem. I have not tried it with that phone before. Original backup is via nextcloud, i copied to the ssd
23:02:10 <cdesai> anything that works with the phone should work with the backup app.
23:06:34 <dmatrixs[m]> <Th0mas_ "Has anybody sucessfully used the"> Same issue but I have not tried the USB route yet. All I know is that Nextcloud is offered as a restore option on my device but trying to choose that option crashes the dialogue.
23:09:59 <dmatrixs[m]> <dazinism "dmatrixs: think the universal ve"> Maybe I'm being thick but I don't see a way to download from here?
23:10:00 <Th0mas_> Yeah that does not work since it tries to open a "market://" url and graphene has no default store installed. Turns out my ssd was exFat which is not supported yet, trying with a fat32 usb stick now
23:10:36 <cdesai> dmatrixs[m]: yeah it's a chicken and egg problem
23:10:46 <dmatrixs[m]> <Th0mas_ "Yeah that does not work since it"> Keep me posted?
23:10:50 <cdesai> Th0mas_: in some cases the phone does prompt you to reformat
23:11:22 <Th0mas_> it does, but not during the install process
23:12:13 <cdesai> yeah
23:16:00 <Th0mas_> Ah progress, the fat32 stick gets recognized. On selecting it it complains no backup found though.
23:17:24 <Th0mas_> seedvault is nice and logs the reasons for that to logcat, but i can't access that so early. Lets hope the buffer is long enough for me to enable developer adb after failed restore and still get the events :D
23:19:19 <cdesai> It is. You can also launch the restore activity via adb for faster testing
23:29:14 <nickcalyx[m]> > Yeah that does not work since it tries to open a "market://" url and graphene has no default store installed. Turns out my ssd was exFat which is not supported yet, trying with a fat32 usb stick now
23:29:14 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe we should enable other filesystems in,the kernel
23:29:49 <nickcalyx[m]> The easy ones that dont need fuse or whatever
23:30:19 <dmatrixs[m]> <cdesai "dmatrixs: yeah it's a chicken an"> Still a little confused about what to make of that link XD
23:31:25 <cdesai> nickcalyx[m]: exfat has good support in mainline now
23:31:39 <cdesai> dmatrixs[m]: how bout an omlette?
23:31:59 <dmatrixs[m]> <dazinism "So can update from an older vers"> Maybe this is what I'm unsure how to do.
23:32:20 <JTL> cdesai: yummy
23:32:55 <JTL> lunch with cdesai, someday :D
23:32:58 <JTL> lol
23:33:16 <cdesai> Lol sure :D
23:34:03 <cdesai> dmatrixs[m]: basically what I meant was next cloud needs to be installed for restore but you can't install just any app from setupwizard, and can't restore after you're done with it
23:35:33 <dmatrixs[m]> <cdesai "dmatrixs: basically what I meant"> O man I was talking about that github link still. I just discovered the assets at the bottom LOL. I read you loud and clear on the other topic
23:39:04 <Th0mas_> The backup app really does like its state :D Even after reboot, starting the activity with `adb shell am start -a 'com.stevesoltys.seedvault.RESTORE_BACKUP'` just goes back to where you left it. And once it has found a backup it won't let go and let me chose another one :D But it's working now. Main issue was the exfat, dunno why fat32 did not work
23:39:04 <Th0mas_> immediately it worked 2nd, 3rd, 4th try. Thanks for your help!
23:49:41 <igioo[m]> This might be a bit off topic but are people just making stuff up in regards to what TikTok can do? At least on iOS wouldn't you have to grant explicit permission to the app for it to get access to location, camera, microphone etc? And I thought with the way iOS worked it prevented apps from seeing/communicating with other apps? Like it shouldn't be possible for TikTok to see what your doing in safari or what apps you
23:49:41 <igioo[m]> have downloaded or am I misunderstanding things?
23:51:08 <JTL> igioo[m]: I'd be curious to see an actual audit, versus some random comments
23:51:19 <prion_disease[m]> The problem is non-privacy oriented people will just allow any permission to pop up because they don't care.  We are the 1%
23:52:30 <gee_one[m]> I was very tempted to download it out of curiosity when it was on the verge of being banned... But I couldn't do it... Even on my test phone.
23:53:38 <prion_disease[m]> I wish AOSP had all the permissions with the option of "only while using the app" instead of only location having that option
23:53:52 <restf[m]> grapheneos-offtopic !NKqyWWNTlbuXwOPMCt:matrix.org
23:54:06 <igioo[m]> I guess that's what I don't understand like if you have an iPhone I don't see how downloading the app would pose any risk to you
23:54:50 <strcat[m]> igioo: iOS and Android have similar permission systems
23:54:59 <strcat[m]> prion_disease: camera and microphone are only while the app is in foreground
23:55:11 <strcat[m]> prion_disease: there is just no background request option for camera/microphone
23:55:11 <prion_disease[m]> You're right, it comes down to whether your okay with the CCP having what data you can't deny
23:55:37 <strcat[m]> prion_disease: i.e. it's the allow in background that's missing for camera/microphone
23:55:42 <strcat[m]> not allow in foreground only
23:56:02 <strcat[m]> it worked differently in non-modern Android
23:56:29 <strcat[m]> and similarly clipboard is only accessible to focused app + your chosen keyboard (focused is a bit more strict than in foreground)
23:56:48 <strcat[m]> (i.e. if you have 2 apps split screen and 1 app as foreground service only focused one can access clipboard but all 3 can access camera)
23:56:53 <strcat[m]> (assuming it has camera perm ofc)
