00:33:46 <brenneke[m]> Have decided to get a new 4a, will pick up and flash GOS tomorrow.
00:33:46 <brenneke[m]> Platform-tools has been downloaded and extracted on a Windows 10 machine, path is set and get correct output from fastboot --version in Powershell.
00:33:46 <brenneke[m]> Prior to unlocking the bootloader, (fastboot flashing unlock) is there a command I can run to verify proper connection to the phone?

00:47:34 <whatisthematrix[> I was able to see the login page for public WiFi at one place. I did not login however as I did not know the credentials. Are we also trying to test if I can connect?
00:52:15 <niky> Hello everyone , i have finally flashed grapheneos on my pixel 4a!
00:52:52 <niky> Thank you Daniel Micay and fellow members of the community.
00:52:59 <niky> :)
00:53:12 <niky> Have a good day / night !

01:31:45 <TheJollyRoger> Since to powershell, "curl" and "curl.exe" produce different results for me; "curl.exe" works.
01:43:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: why are you overcomplicating though
01:43:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> You very well know you can take a browser to the releases page on windows
01:43:41 <TheJollyRoger> Sorry. You take this one then.

02:37:37 <Lia[m]> <Peacockdude[m] "Wish i could get COS or at least"> Sadly Android tablets are nowhere secure in hardware and software
03:47:20 <strcat[m]> madd_hatter: an important aspect of it is that it will be a regular app (untrusted_app), not a privileged app (priv_app, platform_app, etc.) with whitelisted privileged permissions
03:47:31 <strcat[m]> and we won't be making it a trusted provider for various base OS features
03:47:45 <strcat[m]> it will be a separate, optional thing without special integration beyond appearing to other apps to be Play services
03:48:04 <strcat[m]> and we'll also be doing some hardening

06:20:24 <Lia[m]> What matters is the support for alternative OS and avb keyring
06:51:55 <xhdffgzsxkiy> Hey, I'm maybe gonna buy a Pixel phone to make my life and data mor secure and private... I'm already using LineageOS without GAPPS on a PocoF1, but I understand that GrapheneOS on a Google Pixel Phone is the most secure option there (for the locked boot loader).Is that reaaly true? Aren't there any most secure option? Is GrapheneOS also compatible
06:51:55 <xhdffgzsxkiy> with Pixel 4a 5G?Thanks for helping me
07:00:14 <Lia[m]> <xhdffgzsxkiy "with Pixel 4a 5G?Thanks for help"> Nope.
07:00:16 <Lia[m]> Not supported yet
07:00:21 <Lia[m]> Just 4a (sunfish)
07:00:31 <Lia[m]> Has to be sunfish, and non verizon model.
07:00:50 <Lia[m]> (One can see the device name when rebooting to bootloader)
07:01:34 <sentientai[m]> <Lia[m] "What matters is the support for "> Thanks!🙂 I really hope they keep providing low-level access and have no backdoors that can be exploited.
07:02:35 <Lia[m]> Linux kernel bugs can be backdoors too /s
07:03:28 <Lia[m]> Kidding aside, there are insider attack resistance and security chip that prevents firmware tampering or update until.the phone is unlocked, which is one of the many ways one can verify the OS installed
07:05:13 <Lia[m]> Also, you'd have verified boot and attestation to assure the authenticity and integrity of the OS
07:07:11 <sentientai[m]> That's good to know. I really hope now that Daniel doesn't have to deal with the lawsuit stuff. This project is so valuable.
07:08:46 <Lia[m]> <sentientai[m] "That's good to know. I really ho"> It's why people get too salty, selfish and wanted to destroy it
07:09:28 <Lia[m]> Not sure, why some people don't like nice things, depend on it but proceeded to cause harm
07:12:27 <sentientai[m]> Yeah. As long as GrapheneOS is better than Copperhead OS (which it always will be), it's going to be a target. That's why I hope they get a final ruling and put this all behind them. Online attacks will keep going on but won't work anymore.
07:17:07 <mangojuice> grapheneos ayy, irc is difficult to grasp in the deep end
07:17:28 <Lia[m]> <mangojuice "grapheneos ayy, irc is difficult"> Unfortunately.

07:18:48 <mangojuice> just for reference do you have any places other than complicated documents to understand more
07:20:22 <mangojuice> only asking in this chat as graphene users are trustworthy
07:20:46 <Lia[m]> <mangojuice "just for reference do you have a"> Wdym?
07:20:57 <Lia[m]> what document?
07:21:17 <mangojuice> honestly looking for a mentor i guess
07:21:36 <Lia[m]> <mangojuice "only asking in this chat as grap"> Not all of them, and don't just trust us. Verify the info given, and make sure it is in accordance to fact, and not just alternative facts (or just opinions)
07:22:24 <Lia[m]> <mangojuice "honestly looking for a mentor i "> Mentor for?
07:22:28 <mangojuice> ive lost my touch with technlogy
07:25:30 <Lia[m]> Ohh, not sure where to start with that. And not everyone can assure they can give correct info 100%, even under the assumption they are mentoring in good faith and genuinity...
07:25:30 <Lia[m]> I honestly just recommend reading, learning and researching at your own pace, but there are some people you might want to avoid, like Rob Braxman, Techlore, etc
07:25:43 <Lia[m]> In getting information
07:26:25 <Lia[m]> Sometimes other people intentionally cherrypick info that is favorable to narrative, and discussing this is getting a little too off-topic.
07:26:40 <Lia[m]> <mangojuice "ive lost my touch with technlogy"> I'd advise just asking here for now, or the off-topic chat
07:29:09 <mangojuice> ofc nothing will be 100% correct but maybe im looking in the wrong place for info i need

10:13:30 <ghosty1> it happens quite often as well and like i said its not a gentle wake it flashes open instantly
10:15:29 <strcat[m]> that's always how it wakes up and turns on the screen
10:15:31 <strcat[m]> you're probably shaking the desk

17:24:00 <cyborgninjaneer[> Some bank apps rely on Google to work, so they aren't compatible with privacy and freedom respecting operating systems.

17:26:07 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you're stuck with a bad bank like that, I recommended banking on an iOS device if you can, and using GOS for communication

17:28:25 <mistazaki[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "What does the app say when you t"> Some function it's not function

17:54:29 <arisu[m]> can't you use your bank via browser otherwise ?
17:55:28 <arisu[m]> not the best solution but it's still better than nothing ig
17:57:07 <alzxjm[m]> Get a 2016 iPhone SE for like $50-75 for stuff like that.
17:59:27 <alzxjm[m]>  * You could get a 2016 iPhone SE for like $50-75 for stuff like that.
17:59:42 <alzxjm[m]> (or any other iPhone)
18:00:04 <alzxjm[m]> Just use it for rando tasks like that, where the app absolutely won't work on GrapheneOS.
18:17:56 <arisu[m]> i always wondered about vanadium settings : why some stuff are marked by default as "blocked" whereas when you go into them, it's not "blocked" as expected ?
18:18:39 <strcat[m]> arisu: because you haven't permitted the app as a whole to access it
18:19:06 <strcat[m]> and all those are between block vs. ask anyway
18:30:24 <anon1000[m]> anupritaisno1: u
18:49:23 <entry1[m]> <arisu[m] "can't you use your bank via brow"> Correct. Amazing how many apps aren't needed with just using the browser.
20:06:01 <noop> Pixel 5 on sale
20:06:10 <noop> should I get it and hope it will be supported one day? haha
20:11:23 <Golli[m]> The issue with that is there is currently not even anyone working on a P5 version of GOS.
20:11:55 <Golli[m]> There's no guarantee that there's going to be a version of it, so I'd say play it safe and get a currently supported device.
20:13:54 <noop> I don't like any of the currently supported devices :(  That said, 4a seems to have gone pretty quickly from nothing to beta to stable
20:26:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> Could get a used supported Pixel until the model you want might be supported
20:27:02 <hypokeimenon[m]> That's probably what I'll do
20:31:18 <Coffee[m]1> I know this is a little off topic, but does anyone recommend a good protective case for the 4a to compliment the GOS installation? 😁
20:31:43 <alzxjm[m]> Of currently-supported phones, Pixel 4 XL has the most powerful processor, biggest screen, and still retains the Pixel Neural Core.
20:31:48 <alzxjm[m]> Pixel 4a and 5 have lower-end processors and no PNC.
20:32:11 <alzxjm[m]> Only downside is one less year of support.

20:43:15 <Golli[m]> Not sure if the face unlock is working on the 4XL but the radar doesn't.
20:43:26 <Golli[m]> (The radar is mostly for motion gestures anyway)
20:52:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> someguy458: no performance differences between the 2
20:52:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Face unlock works

20:52:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Radar doesn't
20:53:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> We don't ship apps for it
20:53:32 <arisu[m]> does face unlock works for sunfish as well ?
20:57:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
20:58:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sunfish has no face unlock
20:58:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> It uses fingerprint from what I know

23:20:13 <systemctl[m]> Is it private? Yeah, just believe us. It requires google play services and is closed source.
23:25:42 <rny> systemctl[m]: why would an os ever support exposure notification explicitly?
23:26:02 <rny> its the responsibility of the application to implement the feature
23:26:12 <rny> within the constraints of the OS API
23:28:26 <systemctl[m]> good point
23:29:08 <systemctl[m]> but with a dependency on google play services, nobody with GOS will ever get it
23:29:40 <systemctl[m]> google open sourced the notification server though
23:30:13 <rny> the app vendor can bake in a service implementation that polls the notification server
23:30:29 <rny> and just use android background services api

23:46:50 <textmate> How is eSIM support on Pixel 4a looking?
23:46:51 <systemctl[m]> <rny "and just use android background "> Well washington state seemed to have used the google play services route, and not their own notification server
23:47:09 <rny> systemctl[m]: thats too bad then
23:47:32 <rny> systemctl[m]: you should write to the state government to complain about them alienating android users.

23:48:49 <jpds> textmate: As I understood, the bits in Android for that are propietary
23:48:59 <textmate> :(
23:49:10 <textmate> Thats not nice
23:49:20 <rny> textmate: question is how your telco operator implements eSIM?
23:49:31 <textmate> I dont know I'll have to ask
23:49:48 <rny> textmate: they probably wont even understand what exactly you're asking
23:49:50 <textmate> my ISP
23:50:11 <textmate> I can just ask them to let me speak to their IT dept.
23:50:26 <jpds> engulf[m]: Yes, and the captive portal thing works outside the VPN
23:51:40 <TheJollyRoger> If I recall correctly, GrapheneOS does support eSIM - the backend to support it works. However, there is no frontend app to configure it. Help is wanted there.
23:51:51 <jpds> textmate: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/159
23:52:09 <rny> stock aosp already exposes eUICC apis
23:52:33 <rny> your telco needs to interact with those APIs
23:52:54 <rny> but many just implement against play services instead :(
23:55:56 <rny> textmate: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/connect/esim-overview
23:56:07 <rny> ask your telco's IT department to read
23:58:25 <textmate> Ok
23:59:16 <textmate> I might actually
23:59:31 <textmate> I better read up on it myself so I know what im talking about when they ask me haha
