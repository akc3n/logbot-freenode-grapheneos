01:24:59 <aeonsolution[m]> @d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org: yes depot-tools are required to build out vanadium
01:27:17 <aeonsolution[m]> make sure you have the following:
01:27:19 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
01:27:30 <aeonsolution[m]> https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_build_instructions.md#System-requirements
01:29:45 <aeonsolution[m]> this project is more resources for a longer period of time than it does to build grapheneos
01:30:17 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] this project uses more resources for a longer period of time than grapheneos does
01:30:40 <aeonsolution[m]> but it doesnt peak as high, if that makes sense
01:33:06 <Vappy[m]> Does grapheneOS use trebuchet launcher?
01:33:50 <aeonsolution[m]> if im not mistaken, its the aosp launcher, you can check out the logs. its probably been brought up before
01:35:20 <aeonsolution[m]> <cn3m[m] "https://linuxplumbersconf.org/ev"> cn3m: thanks for sharing that video. good stuff as always.
01:52:32 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "cn3m: thanks for sharing that vi"> cheers any thoughts?
02:01:41 <aeonsolution[m]> ill give you some thoughts after i finish it and sit on it for a bit ðŸ˜€
02:03:06 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <aeonsolution[m] " * [correction] this project use"> Already got these prerequisites
02:03:18 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> But not sure why `fetch` fails
02:04:22 <aeonsolution[m]> you ran `fetch --nohooks android`
02:04:46 <aeonsolution[m]> after clone the repo and then changing directory to Vanadium/
02:05:03 <aeonsolution[m]> cloning*
02:06:02 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Ok looks likes it's working now and I messed up the path yesterday
02:06:13 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
02:06:32 <aeonsolution[m]> there will be hiccups, after enough practice. you'll get it down
02:06:39 <aeonsolution[m]> its just repitition
02:06:55 <aeonsolution[m]> repetition*
02:07:00 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant spell today, nice
02:07:24 <aeonsolution[m]> since this is your first build
02:07:55 <aeonsolution[m]> jump to "Generate a signing key for Vanadium if this is the initial build"
02:08:15 <aeonsolution[m]> then jump back to "You need to set trichrome_certdigest to the correct value for your generated signing key. You can obtain this with the following command:"
02:08:38 <aeonsolution[m]> its a little confusing the first time around, not gonna lie
02:08:57 <aeonsolution[m]> obv when you get to that step
02:09:11 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Still failed
02:09:19 <aeonsolution[m]> wait what
02:09:30 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> What should I use in home directory
02:09:30 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Looks like ~/Vanadium doesn't work
02:09:49 <aeonsolution[m]> if that doesnt work, that means you didnt clone the project
02:09:57 <aeonsolution[m]> or at least not in your home directory
02:10:20 <aeonsolution[m]> i would do this. nuke the things you downloaded to free up space
02:10:35 <aeonsolution[m]> then open your shell and `cd $HOME`
02:10:46 <aeonsolution[m]> and do the commands again
02:12:42 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> will the PATH directory ~/depot_tools do?
02:13:03 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Or should I do /home/user/depot_tools
02:13:13 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> user - my username here
02:13:16 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to add it to your .bashrc
02:13:32 <aeonsolution[m]> i think the instructions tell you what to add
02:13:35 <aeonsolution[m]> let me check
02:13:52 <aeonsolution[m]> in the meantime, delete everything you downloaded for Vanadium
02:14:03 <aeonsolution[m]> and make sure depot-tools is in your home directory
02:14:41 <aeonsolution[m]> https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/android_build_instructions.md#install-depot_tools
02:15:17 <aeonsolution[m]> let me check my bashrc, i dont remember the syntax i used off the top of my head
02:15:23 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> It's in home directory now
02:15:39 <aeonsolution[m]> this is one of those unspoken programmer things lol
02:16:00 <aeonsolution[m]> its annoying but hey if you figure it out or get help, youll be good
02:17:36 <aeonsolution[m]> in your terminal
02:17:56 <aeonsolution[m]> #change to home directory
02:17:56 <aeonsolution[m]> `cd $HOME`
02:18:37 <aeonsolution[m]> #open up nano(if you have never used vim) or vim
02:18:37 <aeonsolution[m]> `nano .bashrc` or `vim .bashrc`
02:18:43 <aeonsolution[m]> at the end of the file
02:19:16 <aeonsolution[m]> add `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/depot_tools"
02:19:20 <aeonsolution[m]> and save the file
02:19:43 <aeonsolution[m]> im getting off for now, but that should set your path
02:19:56 <aeonsolution[m]> also, close your shell and open it again to make sure it set the path
02:20:06 <aeonsolution[m]> good luck
02:20:38 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <aeonsolution[m] "add `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/de"> Ah... I wrote the wrong directory therem let me edit after my next attempt to fetvh
02:47:38 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Thanks! Made a new partition instead
02:59:44 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Heck yeah it's working
03:49:48 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Taking longer than I thought
05:32:07 <theultron[m]> Does Asus allows relocking the bootloader with custom keys? They launch phones with source code. https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ikioxy/asus_zenfone_7_bootloader_unlock_tool_and_kernel/
05:33:28 <theultron[m]> May be Asus can be considered for GOS projects.
05:34:29 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <theultron[m] "Does Asus allows relocking the b"> Nope...
05:34:50 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Unless they changed it
05:34:56 <renlord> asus does not have good vendor support though
05:35:58 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <renlord "asus does not have good vendor s"> ^
05:36:07 <theultron[m]> Ok though they ship security updates timely for my mom's phone which is a low end device.
05:46:09 <JTL> renlord: Kinda offtopic, their RMA service in Canada used to be a dumpster fire
05:46:21 <JTL> (To be fair, most OEMs do. I had a good experience with EVGA once though)
05:47:27 <renlord> evga produces phones?
05:47:29 <renlord> @_@
05:47:49 <theultron[m]> I thought they just used to make GPUs.
05:47:55 <JTL> renlord: It was a GPU
05:48:40 <JTL> renlord: Was just contrasting other ways in which ASUS has sucked :P
05:48:46 * JTL had a bit of an axe to grind
05:49:22 <theultron[m]> My best rma experience is with Corsair, Sapphire, Logitech, Seasonic & Intel. But all depends who is handling the rma for the product in your country. So take that into factor when you purchase a product.
05:49:41 <JTL> yup
05:50:18 <JTL> (i.e ASUS RMA sucked in Canada as of four years ago. I heard their US department isn't much better. Unsure as for Europe with it's (in theory) better consumer protection laws)
05:50:20 <JTL> </offtopic>
14:39:59 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> How many hours does fetch --nohooks android usually last at slow connection?
14:47:52 <marlow11[m]> Is it normal to show 3.6/4.0 GB memory in use? Pixel 2. I've noticed slowdowns and apps freezing more and more often lately. Not sure if it's to do with new version or if I should wipe my phone and clean install GOS.
14:51:06 <bkeys> Hi all, I am trying to put a new hostfile on my grapheneos device
14:51:32 <bkeys> And using adb push/pull ain't working because it is saying that it is a read only filesystem
14:52:22 <bkeys> Hi all, I am trying to put a new hostfile on my grapheneos device
14:52:34 <bkeys> Hi all, I am trying to put a new hostfile on my grapheneos device
14:52:44 <bkeys> And using adb push/pull ain't working because it is saying that it is a read only filesystem
17:09:19 <madaidan[m]> You can't without destroying the security model
17:49:31 <Hugh[m]> Just seen a video mentioning https://calyxos.org anyone seen or heard of it?
17:50:24 <kickstart> yup
17:50:31 <kickstart> try there channel
17:50:39 <kickstart> #calyxos
17:51:46 <Hugh[m]> I was more just wondering where it falls on the spectrum between grapheneos and less trustworthy, they seem to target a very similar set of devices. Is the codebase drawn from graphene?
17:51:54 <Hugh[m]> security not trustworthiness
17:53:00 <kickstart> then i think people imn grapheneos offtopic will help you more than me
17:53:07 <kickstart> i'm just and average joe
17:56:43 <alzxjm[m]> Hugh: The CalyxOS room is a great place to ask these questions. CalyxOS and GrapheneOS are related projects that have shared features/code in both directions. CalyxOS is AOSP + a good implementation of microG for broader app compatibility. It comes pre-installed with the F-Droid privileged extension for auto-updates and with Aurora Store, in addition to other privacy-focused apps.
17:57:15 <alzxjm[m]> Calyx developed Seedvault, the backup solution Graphene uses. Calyx utilizes the deny USB feature in Graphene.
17:57:53 <alzxjm[m]> They only support devices which allow re-locking the bootloader with a custom OS, hence Pixels and they also target the Mi A2 which can accomplish the same thing.
17:58:33 <cn3m[m]> <Hugh[m] "I was more just wondering where "> Calyx is lacking almost all hardening features of GrapheneOS for security and privacy beside the restricted USB. No hardened exec spawning to protect ASLR, stack canaries, memory tags, random heap layout, etc between processes(due to process cloning in Android). GrapheneOS disables dynamic kernel modules support to help greatly harden CFI implementations. GrapheneOS uses
17:58:33 <cn3m[m]> hardened_malloc which has a strong track record catching memory corruption bugs. GrapheneOS uses linux-hardened which greatly cuts off attack surface by CONFIG_SECURITY_PERF_EVENTS_RESTRICT, GRKERNSEC_DEVICE_SIDECHANNEL, CONFIG_SECURITY_TIOCSTI_RESTRICT, kernel.deny_new_usb, CONFIG_TCP_SIMULT_CONNECT_DEFAULT_ON, init_on_free, CONFIG_USER_NS_UNPRIVILEGED
17:58:47 <cn3m[m]> it also has sensors and firewall permissions exposed
17:59:43 <Hugh[m]> Thanks all, interesting to hear about the sharing of code. I might head over to there channel at some point. Plenty happy with Graphene right now
17:59:48 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS also avoids features CalyxOS adds for not meeting security standards of GrapheneOS(which is not to say they are insecure) like microG and F-Droid Privileged Extension.
18:00:25 <cn3m[m]> hardened exec spawning in GrapheneOS also improves privacy by closing a method of cross profile identification
18:00:49 <cn3m[m]> that should sum up most of the big changes in GrapheneOS from AOSP which they are both based on
18:01:26 <alzxjm[m]> Hugh: I use CalyxOS with microG disabled which still allows some functionality of things like Gcam and eSIM. If you're happy on Graphene then there would be no real reason to switch. Only if you needed to run an app that does not function without Google Play Services. In that case, microG would likely solve your problem. CalyxOS uses a more locked-down implementation of microG relative to other projects.
18:02:00 <alzxjm[m]> But suffice it to say microG, even Calyx's implementation, does not clear GrapheneOS's security standard.
18:02:13 <cn3m[m]> Yeah the only thing to be careful about with CalyxOS is microG is a privacy risk since the apps that are broken are usually using Google Cloud Messaging which sends your push notifications through Google without end to end encryption
18:02:52 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS is much more focused on out of the box experience and compatibility. GrapheneOS is much more focused on security and privacy
18:03:11 <cn3m[m]> though CalyxOS is still one of the best when it comes to privacy and security
18:03:27 <cn3m[m]> especially if you turn off microG(or specifically cloud notifications)
18:06:27 <cn3m[m]> dsztr: welcome
18:14:20 <tinkerthinker> Greetings!
18:15:23 <cn3m[m]> tinkerthinker: hello
18:15:24 <tinkerthinker> Thanks to Daniel and the rest of the team for doing the hard work. GrapheneOS is a real service to the public.
18:16:37 <tinkerthinker> I'm looking for a phone to install GOS on. I'd like to get a Pixel 3a XL, but have one concern ...
18:17:18 <tinkerthinker> Having used phones with lower end processors before, I've sometimes found Signal video via cellular to freeze and jitter
18:17:18 <svenskuser[m]> The suspence is killing me
18:17:55 <tinkerthinker> Thinking before I type ... it slows you down but has benefits :)
18:18:24 <tinkerthinker> anyway, has anyone had those problems on the 3a XL using Signal?
18:20:03 <tinkerthinker> (also, has anyone noticed that the 3a XL has fewer pixels than the regular 3a? XL: 1080x2160, regular: 1080x2220)
18:21:12 <tinkerthinker> Or has anyone had those problems on the regular 3a?
18:27:49 <cn3m[m]> tinkerthinker: I had no issue with either on my 3a
18:27:56 <cn3m[m]> but it is not exactly a super fast phone
18:28:33 <tinkerthinker> Luckily I don't need performance, other than for full-screen live video chat
18:31:05 <tinkerthinker> Also, is there any significant difference in security between the 3a and the 4? I assume GOS for 3a uses AOSP 10, not 9 (?).
18:31:31 <tinkerthinker> (9 is stock on the 3a, which is why I ask)
18:31:57 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "Also, is there any significant d"> the 3a uses 10 and so does stock
18:32:16 <cn3m[m]> the 4 is a general improvement security wise and a huge leap in biometric security
18:32:25 <cn3m[m]> the 4 has longer support and a newer kernel
18:32:39 <cn3m[m]> the 4 is the better security choice, but it doesn't matter
18:32:41 <tinkerthinker> I must have been misinformed about the stock OS.
18:32:59 <cn3m[m]> though the facial recognition on the 4 is nice
18:33:12 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "I must have been misinformed abo"> Google guarantees the latest OS for 3 years
18:33:50 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS builds from the same source stock comes from and are essentially identical update and version wise
18:34:42 <tinkerthinker> Why doesn't the better security on the 4 matter? Only a marginal difference?
18:35:08 <cn3m[m]> it is a marginal security increase
18:35:14 <tinkerthinker> Trying to decide if it's worth the extra cost. End of support is only 5 months later for the 4, per Google
18:35:22 <tinkerthinker> 5 months later than the 3a
18:35:22 <cn3m[m]> not a iPhone XR/Pixel 3 generation leap
18:35:38 <cn3m[m]> yeah the 4 is worth it if you use biometrics
18:36:10 <cn3m[m]> it means you can't be shoulder surfed/CCTV, they can't use it while you sleep, and it is very secure
18:36:42 <tinkerthinker> I try to use them only with other humans :)
18:37:11 <tinkerthinker> but good point re the shoulder surfing, etc. 'Something you have.'
18:37:31 <tinkerthinker> I suppose there must be 3rd party physical authentication tokens for Android
18:37:49 <cn3m[m]> biometrics are generally the better option
18:37:58 <cn3m[m]> since the timeout is 48 hours
18:38:20 <cn3m[m]> even in the lab attempts to break these biometrics usually take a lot longer than that
18:38:27 <cn3m[m]> it would have to be premeditated
18:38:45 <cn3m[m]> anyway you want to reboot to avoid AFU if your device was seized
18:39:32 <cn3m[m]> I think Face Unlock on Pixel 4 with a scrambled PIN is the way to go(12 if you are paranoid)
18:39:43 <cn3m[m]> be quick on the reboot button if you have concerns
18:39:45 <louipc> lol how does the phone know if youre sleeping
18:39:51 <cn3m[m]> or leave your device unattended
18:40:07 <tinkerthinker> I'm not as worried re in-person targeted attacks  as much as remote tracking, etc.
18:40:24 <cn3m[m]> <louipc "lol how does the phone know if y"> those apps use microphone? This is off topic though
18:40:46 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "I'm not as worried re in-person "> well then use Vanadium and probably avoid F-Droid apps
18:41:23 <tinkerthinker> And in-person threat would most likely be law enforcement, who will have access to my face ...
18:41:56 <tinkerthinker> Why not F-Droid? I know many apps are outdated  there ...
18:42:00 <cn3m[m]> that is why I recommended the reboot
18:42:13 <cn3m[m]> destroys the keys so you can't exploit to extract them
18:42:19 <cn3m[m]> and it disables biometrics
18:42:39 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "Why not F-Droid? I know many app"> F-Droid uses v1 signing which is not verifying the whole apk
18:42:41 <cn3m[m]> has had known issues before
18:42:49 <cn3m[m]> could be used for profile hopping malware
18:42:50 <tinkerthinker> ? reboot disables biometrics? How do I logon after reboot then?
18:43:02 <cn3m[m]> I think it would be the easiest targeted attack against GrapheneOS
18:43:18 <louipc> you need passphrase or pattern or pin after reboot
18:43:27 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "? reboot disables biometrics? Ho"> Before first unlock no keys are stored in the system only in the Titan M
18:43:37 <cn3m[m]> After first unlock
18:43:37 <tinkerthinker> I get it
18:43:46 <cn3m[m]> keys are stored and authenticated by Face or PIN
18:43:58 <cn3m[m]> an exploit can extract that(how Cellebrite works)
18:44:10 <tinkerthinker> that makes sense
18:44:22 <cn3m[m]> they support the PIxel 2-4, but GrapheneOS hardens the whole stack and uses restricted USB
18:44:29 <cn3m[m]> we saw the benefits of Restricted USB
18:44:45 <cn3m[m]> since everyone shut up about extracting from iPhones when that dropped there
18:44:53 <cn3m[m]> so Restricted USB is very strong
18:45:06 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has it too
18:45:45 <cn3m[m]> There is no reason to use Android lockdown mode when the reboot access is just as fast and kills AFU attacks
18:46:18 <cn3m[m]> even Google or GrapheneOS couldn't be coerced to attack your phone once you reboot it(and don't log in again)
18:46:33 <cn3m[m]> due to Titan M insider attack resistance
18:46:54 <tinkerthinker> But that's the same for non-biometrics, right? Except for someone capturing the pw via camera/shoulder/etc
18:47:40 <tinkerthinker> (which isn't trivial - cameras everywhere)
18:48:47 <tinkerthinker> (I should say, which is trivial - not to difficult with cameras everywhere)
18:48:51 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "But that's the same for non-biom"> yeah always reboot your device when leaving it unattended
18:49:11 <cn3m[m]> and if you have biometrics they do time out after 48 hours of the device not being logged into
18:49:23 <cn3m[m]> which forces fooling the sensors into a premeditated attack
18:49:41 <cn3m[m]> if you have a premeditated attack you have bigger issues
18:50:23 <tinkerthinker> Yes. My plan is not to have those issues. Is hope a plan? :)
18:51:20 <tinkerthinker> I lean toward the 3a for my first encounter with GOS. Less investment, better supported (?), and I'll want 5G in a couple years anyway.
18:51:30 <tinkerthinker> GOS plans to support the 3a as long as Google does?
18:52:21 <jpds> tinkerthinker: Yep: https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/764829038997278720/photo/1
18:53:11 <cn3m[m]> they have to be preparing a mold or something to fake the Face unlock in advance having your picture and a timer on the phone is not a good place to be
18:53:12 <Wonderfall[m]> 3a is a great choice. Support end May 2022.
18:53:17 <Wonderfall[m]>  * 3a is a great choice. Support ends May 2022.
18:53:36 <cn3m[m]> jpds: I am saving that
18:53:49 <tinkerthinker> Wonderfall: Google support or GOS support?
18:54:04 <tinkerthinker> jpds: I'm usually on your side of the conversation, so I'm going to save that too
18:54:28 <Wonderfall[m]> Google, but also GOS since GOS cannot provide vendor updates.
18:54:32 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "Wonderfall: Google support or GO"> both
18:54:42 <tinkerthinker> thanks
18:55:12 <tinkerthinker> Thanks for all the help
18:55:25 <cn3m[m]> there are only two cases of GrapheneOS ever dropping a device before the OEM did and they were on a technicality
18:56:01 <tinkerthinker> Hmmm ... how many total devices has GOS supported? Isn't that like 10-20% of all of them?
18:56:06 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 1 was dropped and got a random later update. December brought the Android October 6th update. The Samsung S4 was dropped when the project switched to AOSP
18:56:19 <tinkerthinker> I see
18:56:33 <tinkerthinker> Those make sense.
18:56:50 <tinkerthinker> I realize I've only looked at the recommended devices list. I don't know how many are supported!
18:57:01 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "Hmmm ... how many total devices "> Nexus 5, 5x, 6, 6p, Pixel 1, Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, Pixel 4, Galaxy S4, and development support has been on and off for the hikey boards
18:57:11 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "I realize I've only looked at th"> well
18:57:19 <cn3m[m]> not anymore
18:57:25 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 2 is supported for another month or two
18:57:36 <cn3m[m]> so pretty much just Pixel 3 or 4 families
18:58:31 <tinkerthinker> This has been very helpful; thank you
18:59:26 <tinkerthinker> FWIW, when I tried to access this channel via Tor via Freenode's web interface, it said the IP was banned. Maybe that's unavoidable, but it seems odd for a security-focused community.
18:59:37 <tinkerthinker> I tried a few IPs
18:59:45 <tinkerthinker> *a few Tor IPs
19:00:49 <tinkerthinker> But I could imagine that dealing with Tor traffic might suck too much admin time away from more important things.
19:01:11 <louipc> freenode isnt a security community
19:01:31 <tinkerthinker> loipc: yes, but grapheneos is security-focused
19:01:45 <tinkerthinker> that's what I was referring to
19:01:59 <cn3m[m]> tinkerthinker: join Matrix to get here with Tor
19:02:00 <louipc> you could try matrix if you have issues with freenode tho
19:02:12 <cn3m[m]> <tinkerthinker "loipc: yes, but grapheneos is se"> GrapheneOS is heavily invested in privacy hardening
19:02:18 <louipc> freenode on tor is spotty
19:02:23 <cn3m[m]> the two are inseparable to the project
19:02:25 <jpds> tinkerthinker: Freenode has a IRCd as a Tor hidden service - I'm connected to it right now
19:02:33 <cn3m[m]> <louipc "freenode on tor is spotty"> use Matirx
19:02:37 <cn3m[m]> no issue with Tor on Matrix
19:02:48 <tinkerthinker> what's the .onion address?
19:02:49 <louipc> yea
19:02:57 <jpds> https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat#accessing-freenode-via-tor
19:03:13 <cn3m[m]> tinkerthinker: just clear net element.privacytools.io or something
19:03:21 <tinkerthinker> thanks
19:03:41 <cn3m[m]> it also saves history and has e2ee message support
19:03:49 <cn3m[m]> I use Matrix for all my rss feeds too
19:03:59 <tinkerthinker> I never quite get around to installing matrix, always having an easier solution in the moment. What's the most stable client?
19:04:07 <tinkerthinker> and most secure
19:04:30 <cn3m[m]> element is what I use
19:04:30 <tinkerthinker> (also for GOS)
19:04:30 <cn3m[m]> I generally use the web interface
19:04:59 <tinkerthinker> element for GOS too?
19:06:58 <tinkerthinker> OK, gtg. Many, many thanks. I'll see you around I'm sure ... off on an errand, and maybe to buy a 3a if I can find one.
19:15:24 <ghjllk[m]> Question: What banking apps are supported? iirc there were issues with Bank of America and a few others?
19:18:04 <jpds> ghjllk[m]: https://github.com/techlore-official/plexus
19:21:07 <ghjllk[m]> Is not an exhaustive list and only includes a few banking apps
19:21:25 <ghjllk[m]> Doesn't quite tell me what I'm looking for
19:26:11 <alzxjm[m]> ghjllk: What banking app do you need to know about?
19:26:43 <Vappy[m]> <ghjllk[m] "Is not an exhaustive list and on"> Most banking apps wont worl
19:34:55 <ghjllk[m]> alzxjm Bank of America which iirc was a nightmare in my experience
19:35:12 <ghjllk[m]> Do I need a separate device for banking?
19:56:04 <louipc> nice
20:04:31 <crixtnn[m]> would an installed app let's say Instagram  be able to detect the phone model and the os (grapheneos)?
20:05:50 <cn3m[m]> <crixtnn[m] "would an installed app let's say"> yes please read the FAQ and consider running the privacy breacher app
20:12:40 <crixtnn[m]> I'm considering getting a second device for sensisitive stuff (dissident, anti-gov) but I'm worried that not may others use graphene around here and I could get fingerprinted.
20:13:26 <alzxjm[m]> ghjllk: Bank of America seems to work fine.
20:15:22 <ghjllk[m]> Does it? I got caught in an infinite start loop last time I tried
20:21:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> ghjllk: there was a bug we fixed that crashed a few apps
20:21:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> But wasn't caught by CTS
20:22:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> You should update to the latest version and try it again
20:22:56 <ghjllk[m]> Got it. Will give it a try!
20:23:39 <alzxjm[m]> ghjllk: I'm on CalyxOS with microG disabled so it might not be a perfect test case. I do get a message saying  it won't work without enabling Google Play Services, but it doesn't seem to affect anything. I can login and look at balances and whatever.
20:24:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Facepalm
20:24:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now I don't know what's going to happen
20:34:08 <alzxjm[m]> ghjllk: I'm on Pixel 4 XL and biometric unlock works fine, too.
20:36:00 <alzxjm[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "ghjllk: there was a bug we fixed"> I should have thought of this. I was assuming it was just a Play Services issue. Sorry about that.
21:11:37 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "GrapheneOS awesome! Today I chec"> yes
21:11:42 <cn3m[m]> welcome
21:15:01 <cn3m[m]> Auditor is trust on first use
21:15:44 <cn3m[m]> essentially you pair when you are confident the device is not compromised
21:16:00 <cn3m[m]> then anything changes after are not trusted
21:17:21 <cn3m[m]> Ideally you would verify the install with signify and then setup Auditor, but you are more than likely fine trusting GrapheneOS servers
21:17:24 <cn3m[m]> they are almost certainly better secured than you are
21:18:40 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "If a person give me a GrapheneOS"> anyone could build and flash an OS on it
21:20:49 <cn3m[m]> you can verify it is GrapheneOS though with Auditor from my understanding
21:20:52 <cn3m[m]> http://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fm2zqa/support_for_aurora_services_amp_fdroid/fl2qmp8?context=3
21:21:00 <alzxjm[m]> Is remote attestation better or worse than local verification with another Pixel?
21:21:14 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Is remote attestation better or "> remote is better since it is automatic imo
21:23:05 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "What do you mean? My question is"> I am not 100% sure I am sorry
21:23:07 <cn3m[m]> I would recommend reflashing yourself
21:24:28 <cn3m[m]> I am not certain. From my understanding the first trust model requires the device to be known good
21:24:44 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "Is there anybody that can answer"> probably one of the devs but none are on right now
21:25:40 <cn3m[m]> you can search the lead devs comments here https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos (strcat and strcat[m]) or https://redditcommentsearch.com/ (DanielMicay)
21:25:40 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "How often are they here?"> depends
21:27:50 <sandroteem[m]> Okay.
21:28:27 <sandroteem[m]> Second question: Can anybody show me how an tampered phone check on the Auditor App looks like?
21:30:28 * sandroteem[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/asEislmzovcqEWIJBjmguMBr/message.txt >
21:31:21 <sandroteem[m]> Or does a tampered device don't show "OS: GrapheneOS" at all?
21:32:48 * alzxjm[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/uQxCceuDTrwwtylruOLCJpCS/message.txt >
21:33:05 <alzxjm[m]> But I'm on Pixel 4 XL. Is that expected?
21:33:51 <cn3m[m]> sandroteem: check the Play Store I think the pictures show it
21:34:21 <alzxjm[m]> I did pair it with a Pixel 3 initially.
21:36:53 <sandroteem[m]> I checked out the Playstore pics, but they aren't helpful for me.
21:37:16 <sandroteem[m]> How often the devs are looking in this room?
21:38:02 <sandroteem[m]>  * How often do the devs looking in this room?
21:39:14 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: maybe CalyxOS used same keys for Pixel 4?
21:39:16 <strcat[m]> haven't asked cdesai
21:39:22 <strcat[m]> I could just list extra devices there
21:39:51 <sandroteem[m]> What are the difference between CalyxOS and Graphene?
21:40:24 <nickcalyx[m]> > alzxjm: maybe CalyxOS used same keys for Pixel 4?
21:40:24 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes we use the same keys for all
21:40:27 <sandroteem[m]> GrapheneOS is strictly without gapps. Is CalyxOS a difference?
21:41:26 * alzxjm[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/PvBvnLYsSFKqtZlirhTRkUOC/message.txt >
21:42:29 <sandroteem[m]> nickcalyx: are you a dev?
21:46:03 <dazinism> sandroteem: yeah the fact it says GrapheneOS is good. The other thing to check in the auditor results is accessibility services or device manager enabled.
21:46:54 <dazinism> Best to avoid having an app that uses either if you possibly can
21:47:04 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "What are the difference between "> CalyxOS has a better out of the box experience and support for auto updates of apps and they have a broader app support due to Google integrations. They maintain the AOSP security model.
21:47:20 <dazinism> Its common for malicious apps to use these
21:47:24 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has privacy and hardening patches. No data sent to Google
21:47:32 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS can opt out of microG
21:47:45 <cn3m[m]> they have different target audiences
21:47:50 <cn3m[m]> both are great
21:48:16 <sandroteem[m]> CalyxOS has MicroG integrated?
21:49:00 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "CalyxOS has MicroG integrated?"> It asks if you want to use it at setup. Considering Google Cloud Messaging doesn't use end to end encryption you could use microG with that off(but breaks most of the gains)
21:50:00 <dazinism> Yes they do, can chose to have it enabled / disabled on first boot
21:50:29 <sandroteem[m]> Okay with MicroG integrated most of the normal apps Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Tinder, etc. work, right?
21:50:57 <sandroteem[m]> Because the fake the gapps apis?
21:51:33 <cn3m[m]> Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram all work fine on GrapheneOS. Facebook makes a point to support AOSP
21:51:54 <cn3m[m]> Twitter and Tinder I do not know, but there are alternative Twitter clients
21:52:46 <sandroteem[m]> All these apps are bad. I know. That was a little set of apps for the "normal" user.
21:53:25 <sandroteem[m]> Okay. How do you install WhatsApp on GrapheneOS? Fdroid -> Aurora -> Facebook?
21:54:10 <dazinism> Apps that use safetynet likely wont work. Instagram, PokÃ©mon Go, some banking apps
21:54:14 <sandroteem[m]>  * Okay. How do you install WhatsApp on GrapheneOS? Fdroid -> Aurora -> WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram?
21:54:40 <sandroteem[m]> What is safetynet?
21:55:00 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "Okay. How do you install WhatsAp"> yes
21:55:11 <dazinism> Yeah, or just download aurorastore from github or elsewhere they offer it
21:55:15 <sandroteem[m]> Is Instagram working on GrapheneOS?
21:55:35 <sandroteem[m]> <dazinism "Yeah, or just download aurorasto"> Yes, okay
21:55:41 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "Is Instagram working on Graphene"> yes
21:55:46 <cn3m[m]> it is a Facebook app
21:56:08 <cn3m[m]> Facebook doesn't want reliance on Google
21:56:20 <dazinism> Have to get Instagram from Huawei Store, or maybe Amazon store I think?
21:56:29 <sandroteem[m]> <cn3m[m] "it is a Facebook app"> Can you please explain why this fact make it work?
21:56:58 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "Can you please explain why this "> I know people have run it and Facebook wants to be independent of Google
21:57:44 <sandroteem[m]> Okay, I tried to install Spotify but the app didn't start.
21:57:59 <dazinism> I thought that Instagram from Play used safetynet and didnt work, maybe I'm getting confused?
21:58:04 <sandroteem[m]> Have anybody installed Spotify successfully?
21:58:10 <sandroteem[m]>  * Has anybody installed Spotify successfully?
21:58:15 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "I thought that Instagram from Pl"> Snapchat
21:58:25 <dazinism> Think Spotify works OO
21:58:28 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "Have anybody installed Spotify s"> idk Apple Music works here
21:58:35 <dazinism> OK
21:58:53 <sandroteem[m]> What is saftynet?
21:59:03 <sandroteem[m]> <dazinism "Think Spotify works OO"> from aurora?
21:59:27 <cn3m[m]> <sandroteem[m] "What is saftynet?"> attestation to confirm you are on a stock OS
21:59:43 <dazinism> Safetynet is a remote attestation thing.
22:00:26 <dazinism> Can help app developers/service providers guard against fraud
22:01:30 <dazinism> Yeah probably I'm confused by Snapchat, not Instagram having attestation
22:02:12 <cn3m[m]> Snapchat is way more focused on screenshot detection and controlling access
22:02:19 <cn3m[m]> Instagram runs in a browser even
22:02:19 <dazinism> Think I heard people saying they'd used Spotify via Aurora OK
22:02:32 <cn3m[m]> it doesn't even have Signal yet
22:02:45 <dazinism> There is a fdroid repo which has spotify
22:04:38 <dazinism> Think this repo was set up by one of the DAV5x developers
22:04:43 <dazinism> https://rfc2822.gitlab.io/fdroid-firefox/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=8F992BBBA0340EFE6299C7A410B36D9C8889114CA6C58013C3587CDA411B4AED
22:05:48 <dazinism> Think it scrapes apps from github / websites of developers. Think CalyxOS use the same code for their repo
22:07:00 <sandroteem[m]> Okay I have to test it again.
22:07:21 <dazinism> Repo has Spotify, signal and most the Firefox browser apps (safest to avoid Firefox if possible)
22:07:24 <sandroteem[m]> Can anybody explain me why Aurora downloads multiple versions?
22:07:58 <sandroteem[m]> <dazinism "Repo has Spotify, signal and mos"> Vanadium and Bromite are totally fine for me.
22:08:16 <sandroteem[m]>  * Can anybody explain me why Aurora downloads multiple app versions?
22:08:51 <dazinism> Only seen Aurora Store download multiple for apps with split apk
22:09:08 <sandroteem[m]> split apk?
22:09:46 <dazinism> Yeah its a newish thing.
22:10:51 <dazinism> Think aurorastore can install, but if not you'll need an app
22:11:31 <dazinism> SAI (SAI lets you install and export split APKs) - https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aefyr.sai.fdroid
22:12:39 <alzxjm[m]> <sandroteem[m] "Okay, I tried to install Spotify"> The first time I installed Spotify on Graphene it took a long time to launch buy worked fine after that.
22:12:46 <alzxjm[m]> No issues at all.
22:14:48 <dazinism> I installed Collabora (nice office suit app based on libre office) using Aurora Store a while back. It was split apk, had to use SAI to install
22:15:13 <sandroteem[m]> Whats SAI?
22:15:31 <dazinism> App linked above
22:18:26 <dazinism> sandroteem: maybe this will be useful for you
22:18:35 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
22:23:58 <sandroteem[m]> Installed Spotify again
22:24:03 <sandroteem[m]> Works now
22:24:11 <sandroteem[m]> ðŸ˜€
22:24:24 <sandroteem[m]>  * Works fine now
22:26:40 <sandroteem[m]> Maybe Spotify blocked me, because of Orbot/TOR
22:26:45 <sandroteem[m]> <dazinism "https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/gra"> Thanks
22:29:46 <sandroteem[m]> Back to my Auditor question:
22:29:46 <sandroteem[m]> What is the smartest/best way for person B to set up attestation and send the phone to me?
22:30:17 <sandroteem[m]> Pairing the phone with remote attestation service and send the login data to me?
22:30:41 <sandroteem[m]> The idea is basically to prevent the phone from tampering on transit.
22:35:02 <dazinism> Yeah thats the way to do it
22:38:59 * sandroteem[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/gAmXLCQoYzgagPEWYOBjaBSx/message.txt >
22:39:56 <sandroteem[m]> It is important to do step 3 before sending (4), right?
22:52:29 <dazinism> Guess as long as you have a secure channel to send info doesnt matter when he sends login. They could even do the check for you after you receive and never have to send login info, or send it after that. Device has to be on for a bit with network before it will connect to the attestation.app server
22:59:14 <aeonsolution[m]> <d64qoc8432li8p9o "How many hours does fetch --noho"> takes upwards of 4+ hours with a good connection
23:07:11 <sandroteem[m]> What info he needs to send me? Only the login? Or the results also?
23:11:29 <aeonsolution[m]> sandroteem: as a rule of thumb, if the app works on Android without Google Play Services it will work on GrapheneOS. It is really up to the user to figure it out since the GOS is a privacy and security focused mobile OS https://grapheneos.org/. Ideally, if you have question specific questions. You check the logs to find an an answer is possible for common things like app installs. Once you exhaust that, then
