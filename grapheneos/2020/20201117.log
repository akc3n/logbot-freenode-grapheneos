03:02:12 <Ryois> Hey
03:18:59 <name88> Installing grapheneOS on pixel4a from Arch, everything appears to go OK but the install gets hung up after flash-all
03:19:11 <name88> no output in terminal but it's busy
03:19:56 <name88> no dongle, using the usb-c cable that came with the phone
03:20:55 <name88> the phone is showing the fastboot screen
03:21:59 <renlord> unplug and plug in again
03:24:30 <name88> huh, it worked lol, thanks!
03:24:57 <name88> anyone know what's causing that bug? will the install be ok?
03:25:17 <renlord> not a bug
03:28:24 <name88> er ok, guessing the computer wasn't recognizing the device then - thanks again
06:30:49 * jimsanches1124[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/sHOzctETFYHHhMRBpvxWKNJM/message.txt >
06:33:28 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS has more hardening and security features than calyx (like a hardened_malloc)
06:33:30 <somenerd[m]> from the website
06:33:32 <TheJollyRoger> Hello jimsanches1124[m, let me see if I can answer your questions:
06:33:37 <somenerd[m]> "GrapheneOS improves the privacy and security of the OS from the bottom up. It has a hardened kernel, libc, malloc and compiler toolchain with many low-level improvements. These changes are designed to eliminate whole classes of serious vulnerabilities or provide meaningful barriers to exploitation"
06:34:11 <somenerd[m]> this may also be relevant :"There are also many under-the-hood changes at a higher level, including major improvements to SELinux policies particularly for the app sandbox."
06:34:38 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS is willing to be more aggressive with prioritizing security and mitigating exploits than Calyx is.
06:34:45 <jimsanches1124[m> <TheJollyRoger "Hello jimsanches1124, let me see"> jeez ur everywhere lol. this would be second time i heard from you today
06:35:46 <TheJollyRoger> Calyx aims to achieve compatibility and all in all, be closer to the user experience that would be expected of Android as released by Google. That's one of its design goals.
06:35:52 <jimsanches1124[m> <jimsanches1124[m "jeez ur everywhere lol. this wou"> i admire that, a very Thorough  person like myself
06:37:16 <jimsanches1124[m> somenerd: thank you very much for that information aswell. that was very informative
06:37:20 <TheJollyRoger> GrapheneOS considers that to take a back seat to security hardening and preventing exploits - although compatibility with existing Android apps is indeed a goal of GrapheneOS, it's not as high on the list of priorities, so this is why at GrapheneOS, you don't see us bundling things like MicroG and other apps that may offer open-source handlers to Google's applications.
06:37:30 <TheJollyRoger> that said:
06:37:42 <TheJollyRoger> And this is VERY important to know:
06:38:10 <somenerd[m]> > somenerd: thank you very much for that information aswell. that was very informative
06:38:10 <somenerd[m]> welcome
06:38:15 <TheJollyRoger> It's also been one of GrapheneOS' core design goals that we do not confuse "security" with "security theatre" and that the security enhancement in GrapheneOS should be unobtrusive, and at best, unnoticeable to you, the user.
06:38:53 <TheJollyRoger> So, don't expect it to put on a show for you or offer you lots of options, knobs, buttons, tunables, sliders, and such.
06:39:32 <somenerd[m]> "We avoid making changes without a clear rationale and we regularly work towards simplifying and replacing these low-level improvements. " -quote from the official website relating to it
06:39:47 <TheJollyRoger> jimsanches1124[m: yep, I enjoy helping other people on their journeys around security, in some ways it helps me gain a better understanding of things in general and I feel it pays for me to keep my ear to the ground!
06:39:58 <somenerd[m]> "GrapheneOS tries to avoid impacting the user experience with the privacy and security features. Ideally, the features can be designed so that they're always enabled with no impact on the user experience and no additional complexity like configuration options." -and this
06:40:08 <TheJollyRoger> Yes!
06:40:19 <TheJollyRoger> What he said!
06:40:45 <somenerd[m]> yeah the official website is surprisingly helpful, though harder to read
06:41:01 <somenerd[m]>  * "GrapheneOS tries to avoid impacting the user experience with the privacy and security features. Ideally, the features can be designed so that they're always enabled with no impact on the user experience and no additional complexity like configuration options." -and this (from the official docs)
06:41:22 <TheJollyRoger> So while the goals of CalyxOS and GrapheneOS may be very similar, and they strongly resemble each other (based on what you see from the screen of your phone), and they support the same hardware, they're very different operating systems with very different (and sometimes, mutually exclusive goals).
06:42:35 <TheJollyRoger> *so while at first glance, the operating systems CalyxOS and GrapheneOS
06:44:59 <TheJollyRoger> But don't let that scare you away; GrapheneOS is perfectly capable of being used as a daily driver, I've been using it as my daily driver almost from the start.
06:45:06 <somenerd[m]> CalyxOS is less focused on hardening (actually I believe they don't do any hardening) than GrapheneOS. They both have different goals (as you can see in the roadmap on the GrapheneOS website).
06:47:48 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. A great big difference in their core philosophies is illustrated by their attitudes toward something like MicroG - CalyxOS includes it to allow applications that have hard dependencies on Google Software Frameworks to function without crashing. At GrapheneOS, because MicroG and GSF has to be incorporated deep into the phone and that offers a HUGE amount of extra attack surface and the
06:47:50 <TheJollyRoger> potential for exploits, which could be extremely dangerous given the privileged nature of what it must do, MicroG was deemed as an anti-feature.
06:47:51 <jimsanches1124[m> i will read that now and come back in a few minutes after i have read : )
06:48:12 <TheJollyRoger> So, again, very different projects, very different philosophies.
06:54:28 <jimsanches1124[m> so graphine is more concerned about not only protecting a user from being spied on by the nsa and the big tech companies but also equally concerned with direct attacks to the user by hackers and whatnot trying to dig deeper into a specific persons device where as calyx is really only focusing on the big tech and nsa side without adding the extra direct attack security to the project ?
06:54:34 <Knull[m]> use copperheados
06:54:34 <Knull[m]> I'm joking, plz dnt ban me
06:56:09 <TheJollyRoger> Avast ye scurvy dog, or I'll make ye walk the plank!
06:56:35 <somenerd[m]> lol
06:56:57 <Knull[m]> 😆
06:57:05 <TheJollyRoger> P.-)
06:58:21 <strcat[m]> jimsanches1124: GrapheneOS is focused on improving privacy and security of the OS substantially
06:58:25 <strcat[m]> CalyxOS doesn't do that
06:58:55 <TheJollyRoger> jimsanches1124[m: GrapheneOS is about making the operating system on your phone harder to exploit, especially with respect to exploits or vulnerabilitiees that target corrupting the memory of the host, which is something the Linux kernel is very vulnerable to.
06:59:11 <strcat[m]> and we aren't willing to hard-wire an incomplete implementation of Google services into the OS with a bunch of special privileges unavailable to regular apps rather than it being kept separate
07:00:40 <Knull[m]> it's surprisingly easy to drop Google, too. My switch to graphene wasn't as rough as I had imagined it would be.
07:01:10 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
07:08:40 <njha[m]> I got a 4A earlier today and lack of gapps has been completely painless (so far)
07:09:14 <njha[m]> I imagine I’ll need google docs at some point though, hopefully the web version is good enough
07:09:34 <njha[m]> but the apps on fdroid are way more fun than iOS apps :)))
07:10:27 <Knull[m]> 4xl here. My only concern maybe is lack of contribution to osmand in my area. Idk where magic earth gets its info from, but it seems better sometimes
07:12:42 <jimsanches1124[m> ok, so after reading and taking in everything It seems to me that calyx is more focused on getting rid of a lot of the google tracking and targeted ads and throwing in some web anonymity and that aspect while graphine on the other hand is doing that and a whole lot more to make the phone as safe and secure as possible. to compare to linux it would be like graphine is more like whonix or tails where as calyx would
07:12:42 <jimsanches1124[m> be like ubuntu. better than windows 10, but not as secure as whonix. have I grasped enough of the understanding yet? lol
07:13:29 <jimsanches1124[m> windows 10 being stock android
07:13:46 <Knull[m]> as far as summaries go, I'd say u got it
07:16:06 <njha[m]> Is there an existing project for an F-Droid compatible store that could be added to GrapheneOS when it’s feature complete?
07:16:51 <njha[m]> I read online that fdroid privileged extension won’t be added, but an alternative store could have a chance(?)
07:22:55 <louipc> calyxos is like assange and grapheneos is like snowden
08:42:59 <dazinism> njha: GrapheneOS needs it own app store. I don't think anyone has yet to do any work on that.
08:43:04 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os#Apps_and_App_Stores
08:46:55 <dazinism> Whats wanted initially is a way to easily update the core GrapheneOS apps without having to do full OS updates then later a curated store with well written and maintained apps.
08:48:08 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Helping-graphene-os#App_Store
08:53:44 <somenerd[m]> hmm
09:08:44 <somenerd[m]> the wiki is really helpful, thanks!
09:25:49 <r0tt0r[m]> hmm i wonder a baked in fdroid with a fixed graphene repo that serves validated apps no good idea?
09:27:02 <somenerd[m]> I believe that f-droid isn't an option
09:27:07 <somenerd[m]> wait let me bring up the link
09:27:39 <somenerd[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/94
09:27:41 <somenerd[m]> here it is
09:29:41 <r0tt0r[m]> ok that then makes sense due the welcomed high policy
09:58:44 <dxrwzy9y[m]> Is it possible to use Duo 2FA without the Duo app and use an open source app instead?
10:55:17 <louipc> i'm not exactly sure what duo 2fa does but theres other 2fa apps like freeotp
10:56:48 <louipc> you can search for 'otp' or 'totp' for others
10:58:42 <TAsn> strcat & team: have you considered adding EteSync pre-loaded to Graphene? EteSync is an end-to-end encrypted sync solution for your contacts, calendars, tasks and notes and it integrates with Android directly. We also plan on supporting backing up apps and much more (just not there yet). I think it would be a great addition to the Graphene security conscious userbase, and make Graphene more useful out of the box. You can even use it to
10:58:42 <TAsn> have something like an "Graphene" account. I created EteSync, and I'm happy to chat more when you're available.
10:58:42 <TAsn> More info: https://www.etesync.com
10:59:17 <louipc> if you would like to discuss non grapheneos apps and services please join #grapheneos-offtopic
10:59:33 <TAsn> louipc: are you talking to me?
10:59:41 <louipc> anyone
11:00:02 <TAsn> Was this comment specifically aimed at me? Because I'm on-topic...
11:00:03 <TAsn> I'm talking about adding it to graphene
11:00:06 <TAsn> (as in shipping by default)
11:00:31 <louipc> no it was meant as follow up for the previous question
11:00:42 <TAsn> Ahh, okie. :)
11:01:09 <TAsn> Btw, I'm the dev behind EteSync, I just realised that my display name doesn't go through to IRC, but I'm the lead dev behind EteSync.
11:01:15 <louipc> but yea, i think you're still offtopic :p
11:02:09 <TAsn> Why? I'm discussing making changes to Graphene itself
11:02:36 <louipc> at this point its a non grapehenos service
11:04:04 <TAsn> Sure, it's not a grapheneos service, but it relates to a core functionality of graphene. Anyhow, I disagree. :)
11:04:11 <louipc> and still would be unlikely to be preloaded because that would be giving preference to one service over other available ones
11:04:42 <louipc> you're welcome to disagree at #grapheneos-offtopic
11:11:22 <TAsn> EteSync is open-source and is based on an open-source protocol. I guess I neglected to mention that in the first message as I assumed people know it. It's also not "a service", because you can run your own server, so it's rather giving preference to a protocol. Given that it's the only one out there, I don't think this point matters. It's also supported by default in GNOME and KDE...
11:11:22 <TAsn> Anyhow, I have nothing more to add, so not gonna visit the offtopic chan. I said what I have to say. Ciao for now.
11:18:06 <louipc> Just to clarify. All non graphenos apps and services open source or closed source should be discussed at #grapheneos-offtopic rather than this channel.
11:18:57 <TAsn> I'm not discussing an app, I'm discussing a modification to the graphene OS itself. But anyhow, I'm done discussing it.
11:20:15 <TAsn> I can't believe I'm still engaging, but just as a thought process: if instead of EteSync I mentioned the EteSync Java library and using it in Graphene. Would that still be off-topic?
11:20:29 <louipcm> yes
11:22:03 <TAsn> Okie, nothing more to add then
11:26:38 <ultracard[m]> Hey Guys, I'm running Graphene OS on my pixel 4a, and I'm really interested in learning more about how the security measures of my phone work. One thing I've always wondered about: Most people use simple 4-6digit pins for their phones. This should be extremely easy to brute force. Does androids encryption have any protections against this. My idea was that maybe the pin is only stored inside of a security element
11:26:38 <ultracard[m]> like the Titan Chip inside my pixel, and that by flash storage is actually encrypted with a much more complex password so that if someone were to take out the flash storage, they wouldn't be able to brute force it as easily as a 6 digit pin. Does anyone here know more about this and could send me a link where i can learn more? I'd be very grateful😊
11:27:05 <ultracard[m]>  * Hey Guys, I'm running Graphene OS on my pixel 4a, and I'm really interested in learning more about how the security measures of my phone work.

11:27:32 <jpds> ultracard[m]: Try bruteforcing your 4-digit PIN by putting in incorrect PINs and see what happens
11:28:07 <ultracard[m]> I'm afraid that graphene os has got a security measure where after 10 tries or so it will wipe my phone
11:28:14 <ultracard[m]> but i'm not talking about brute forcing it by entering a pin by hand
11:28:26 <ultracard[m]> i'm talking about physically removing the flash storage
11:28:52 <ultracard[m]> or maybe there's a way to exploit the USB C port
11:31:54 <ultracard[m]>  * I'm afraid that graphene os has got a security measure where after 10 tries or so it will wipe my phone (I mean: I'd be happy if it did, but i don't want to lose my personal data out of curiosity how secure my phone is xD)
11:57:17 <justanotherlurke> Hi all, been following this discussion for a while, looking for a privacy respecting and secure smartphone OS. So far Graphene looks really good. 👍️
11:57:18 <justanotherlurke> (Only thing that kept me from trying it so far is the limitation to the Pixel phones that cannot expand memory with external SD. 😪)
11:57:18 <justanotherlurke> Are there any plans to support a tablet with Graphene in the future?
11:58:20 <somenerd[m]> I'll refer to https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices
11:58:45 <somenerd[m]> GrapheneOS has a set of minimum standards for devices to support
11:59:18 * brenneke[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ckVoTXVxdRpKSlokMteYVLsR/message.txt >
11:59:20 <nscnt> justanotherlurke: No plans to support a tablet in the future.
11:59:48 <jpds> justanotherlurke: The 4a has 128G of space
12:01:51 <nscnt> ultracard[m]: All I can say is: That's not how it works. I don't feel qualified to really go into the technical details, though (even if I have a kind of knowledge about it). Maybe I can find some old conversations about it.
12:02:57 <nscnt> ultracard[m]: GrapheneOS does not wipe your phone after n-times failed attempts.
12:06:14 <nscnt> ultracard[m]: "That's not how it works." Refers to: Someone has my storage physically and is able to decrypt it with my pin.
12:07:53 <nscnt> You're on a right track that your storage is encrypted with a key encryption key (?). Not directly with your "ImSecure" password
12:10:16 <nscnt> key encryption key > encryption key > files It think it is simplified. So there are several layers of encryption
12:11:26 <nscnt> And Android encrypts file-based, not full-disk
12:12:56 <nscnt> I mean... You could just browse the AOSP and Android Developer documentations if you care about it
12:27:06 <nscnt> TAsn: GPLv3 licensed projects won't be included in GrapheneOS.
12:28:37 <TAsn> nscnt: ah, interesting. Why? Where can I read more about what licences will and will not? What about GPLv2?
12:28:40 <TAsn> Thanks for the info
12:29:54 <nscnt> TAsn: Not sure about GPLv2. https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/48#issuecomment-703351796 as a reference
12:30:13 <TAsn> Thanks!
12:31:58 <TAsn> Based on the comment it seems to be about GPLv3 and not 2. As 2 doesn't prevent that.
12:33:43 <somenerd[m]> I believe GPLv2 is fine
12:34:02 <somenerd[m]> as well as MIT licenses
12:35:13 <saucy-salamander> <TAsn "Btw, I'm the dev behind EteSync,"> Great project btw 👍I didn't really consider backing up contacts (as Google did it for me) hopefully more projects become compatible with eteSync

12:36:13 <TAsn> saucy-salamander: thanks! 😍
12:36:44 <TAsn> somenerd: tbh, I dislike the GPLv3, we just originally based our code on DAVx5 which is GPLv3. ☹️
12:36:53 <somenerd[m]> oh
12:37:12 <somenerd[m]> I heard that the GPLv3 was controversial as well
12:37:54 <somenerd[m]> would you like to move to the offtopic channel? I believe this is going off topic
12:40:12 <TAsn> somenerd: I just read the guidelines again and indeed, licensing in Graphene is also off-topic? Honest question: what's on-topic in this chan? (or is this question also off-topic)
12:41:10 <somenerd[m]> The reason I told that this was getting off topic was mostly because of me (we were talking about licensing).
12:41:36 <somenerd[m]> or rather, I started to talk about the GPLv3
12:41:39 <TAsn> Sorry, the first part wasn't meant to be a question.
12:41:46 <TAsn> I agreed that it's indeed off-topic
12:41:55 <somenerd[m]> oh ok, I misunderstood
12:42:45 <TAsn> Every discussion I've seen since joining this chan was deemed off-topic :|
12:42:50 <somenerd[m]> I believe anything directly related to GrapheneOS ( the OS itself, and maybe bundled apps) is on-topic
12:43:27 <TAsn> But not licensing or changing grapheneos or its bundled apps
12:43:49 <somenerd[m]> I think that is on-topiv
12:43:53 <somenerd[m]>  * I think that is on-topic
12:43:55 <TAsn> Nope, I got told off about that
12:44:05 <somenerd[m]> really?
12:44:24 <somenerd[m]> let me see once...
12:44:39 <TAsn> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/louipc/grapheneos.org/irc/static/irc-rules.txt
12:44:53 <TAsn> See A and E
12:45:19 <somenerd[m]> If I understood correctly, it was because it isn't part of grapheneOS already. But it should be ontopic
12:45:31 <TAsn> That's what I thought
12:45:59 <somenerd[m]> I don't think the users in this channel have the best interpretation of the rules
12:46:14 <somenerd[m]> I'd suggest asking mods
12:47:32 <somenerd[m]> I think direct discussion of services in a non-GrapheneOS context is considered offtopic
12:48:26 <somenerd[m]> I may be wrong though.
12:48:46 <TAsn> I was told off by a mod
12:49:11 <TAsn> though tbh, he was breaking rule 0, so not sure if he cares about the rules himself
12:49:45 <somenerd[m]> not sure then ig
12:49:51 <somenerd[m]> better to listen to the mods
12:50:06 <TAsn> FWIW, it's been a terrible experience coming here as a newcomer.
12:50:29 <somenerd[m]> it's normally better (I'm also a bit new)
13:17:32 <res4[m]> TAsn (EteSync): If you have questions or issues directly concerning the OS itself, you can ask here and get help, provided it isn't something already covered by the FAQ. If you want to talk about things that are only related to the OS, you can do so in the OT channel. Not sure what your problem is. All you have to do is respect the different rules for the different channels.
13:18:34 <somenerd[m]> ok makes more sense now
13:20:09 <aeonsolution[m]> TAsn (EteSync): here is the licensing overview of the project from strcat https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bjixvu/licensing_behind_grapheneos/em8sjus?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3. this link from google discusses the AOSP licenses https://source.android.com/setup/start/licenses.
13:22:32 <aeonsolution[m]> TAsn (EteSync): you might be better off contacting the project directly https://grapheneos.org/contact; the devs aren't here all the time. its the community members and some may not know how to help direct you.
13:23:01 <TAsn> res4: I stopped engaging, I have no problem. The above message was just sharing my subjective feeling as a newcomer here.
13:23:01 <TAsn> As for the exact point you mentioned: did you read what I said initially? I suggested modifications to the OS itself - if this not on-topic, I don't know what is (and it really seems like I don't know what OT is in this chan).
13:23:06 <TAsn> aeonsolution: thanks!
13:24:01 <aeonsolution[m]> you might also be interested in talking with dan-v about EteSync, he has an Android project and uses EteSync
13:24:13 <aeonsolution[m]> ill message you the details because its off-topic
13:24:26 <TAsn> Thanks!
13:25:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys we still need more people to help combat misinformation that is being spread about grapheneos. Please pm me if you can help

13:28:26 <res4[m]> As long as it's about the OS itself, it should be fine. I know that it can be difficult to understand, this strict enforcement is only done so the support people can get to everyone who needs support. In your case, maybe PMing a developer directly would also be a good idea. :)
13:34:16 <TAsn> res4: it's not hard to understand there are rules, and community rules shouldn't be hard to understand. I actually read the rules, and have complied with them to the best of my understanding. I've been running IRC communities for ~10 years if not longer. OpenMoko (SHR), Enlightenment, and EteSync. It's not me being a newcomer that just happened to wander on IRC and been trolling people. I read the rules before posting, was respectful and
13:34:16 <TAsn> made an OT suggestion.
13:34:16 <TAsn> I appreciate you are trying to help me (no complaints to you, you've been great!), but the fact that you are essentially saying: "avoid the chan, reach people in private" should give you an indication that something is off. :|
13:34:50 <TAsn> Anyhow, that's how I feel as a newcomer to this community. Please let's stop this discussion as I already sunk quite a bit of time into this.
13:45:43 <nscnt> TAsn: You'll get an answer here just fine once strcat is available.
13:49:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys I would like to ask everyone to refrain from backseat modding

I actually read the rules, and have complied with them to the best of my understanding. I've been running IRC communities for ~10 years if not longer. OpenMoko (SHR), Enlightenment, and EteSync. It's not me being a newcomer that just happened to wander on IRC and been trolling people. I read the rules before posting, was respectful
13:50:21 <TAsn> and made an on-topic suggestion.
13:50:21 <TAsn> I appreciate you are trying to help me (no complaints to you, you've been great!), but the fact that you are essentially saying: "avoid the chan, reach people in private" should give you an indication that something is off. :|
13:58:13 <somenerd[m]> ok
14:19:32 <idceitherway[m]> <njha[m] "I read online that fdroid privil"> The plan is for the graphene project to develop an app store from scratch. I'm fairly certain it won't be "F-Droid compatible"
14:20:26 <somenerd[m]> yeah
14:27:15 <revoluzifer> Hi there, can anyone tell me by chance, what GrapheneOS Release u need if u have another mobile than a google pixel (Xiaomi MI A2 Lite) but from the grapheneOS compatibility list
14:28:26 <somenerd[m]> I don't think there is any...
14:29:08 <somenerd[m]> (but you may be able to build GrapheneOS for it)
14:32:52 <revoluzifer> ok thx, that would make sense=/  . Sounds like unfeasible task for a dude with his first smartphone but i gues i have to try ^^
14:33:39 <somenerd[m]> not sure if you should though... it does look tough
14:33:48 <somenerd[m]> and even then, no official support
14:39:20 <revoluzifer> I know, but bought now my first smartphone cause i read about graphen and Calyx. So either I give it back or try. Since I wouldn't miss this smartphone as an oldschool mobile user, i will try. at least i saved time for mor senseless releas-searches, thx and bye ^^ If
15:24:47 <mulbr[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Guys we still need more people t"> This seems a relevant on topic discussion. How can community members counter misinformation? An intertwined element is how can community members promote and spread positive information?
15:29:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> revoluzifer: try glassrom
15:30:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you can get it to work fine I'll add it to the list of supported devices
17:18:44 <pebble2hr[m]> Does shelter/island (work profile) play nicely with Graphene?
17:32:21 <Visionz[m]> <pebble2hr[m] "Does shelter/island (work profil"> it works but android profiles are a better option if you want to sandbox apps.
17:38:30 <besamim5781[m]> But I assume that as long as I stay in the other profile, I do not receive notifications from the main profile right?
17:43:08 <dazinism> besamim5781: can get SMS notifications, although that depends which SMS app you use in each.
17:44:17 <dar_gomml[m]> what about app notifications?
17:44:28 <dazinism> When I tried it worked if I used the bundled messenger for SMS in the main profile. Think it the worked with a couple of different SMS apps I tried in the secondary profile
17:45:26 <dazinism> No. As far as I can tell you only get app notifications for the profile you are using.
17:46:34 <dazinism> When I tested back with Nougat I'd get the audio notifications from a different profile. But appears now nothing.
17:47:12 <OOwl[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Guys we still need more people t"> pmed :)
17:47:47 <dazinism> Did the testing with SMS recentlt
17:48:05 <dazinism> * recently, on Android 11
17:48:14 <dazinism> Graphene
17:54:45 <pebble2hr[m]> How many users does graphene allow?
17:57:42 <dazinism> Think its 16
17:57:54 <dazinism> A load of info
17:57:55 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
17:58:27 <pebble2hr[m]> Great! Thank you!
18:01:16 <pebble2hr[m]> Just got my 4a in the mail so I'm thinking through my set up. Trying to maximize privacy/security as much as possible
18:11:19 <dar_gomml[m]> <dazinism "When I tried it worked if I used"> does the work profile behave similar regarding notifications?
18:12:41 <besamim5781[m]> Do you think is it sufficient in terms of privacy and security to keep whatsapp under work profile in shelter rather than in a separate profile?
18:13:03 <besamim5781[m]> <dar_gomml[m] "does the work profile behave sim"> Yes it does
18:27:08 <dazinism> Work profiles are owned by an app (Shelter, Island, some corporate remote device management app, or whatever )
18:28:44 <dazinism> That app has more power over that profile than you. Significant if its malicious or compromised
18:37:18 <besamim5781[m]> Does it matter if it's the only app in my work profile?
18:46:26 <dazinism> The app that manages the work profile has some control over the boundary between the work & personal profile.  Also with eg. Shelter you could grant it admin powers over your main profile + various other things (display over other apps, usage access ) that can be used maliciously (malware uses these types of permissions)
18:48:06 <dazinism> So I guess it depends a bit how secure you want your apps which are in the work profile to be
18:48:39 <dazinism> Also if you give privileges over your main user.
18:49:43 <dazinism> I do use shelter, but don't grant it any powers over my main profile.
18:53:44 <dazinism> When all my apps properly support scoped storage. I'll have less of a reason to use shelter
18:57:13 <dazinism> Sadly that could be another 2+ years -till Google forces apps which want to be on Play Store to target SDK30
19:06:05 <pebble2hr[m]> I'll just use shelter for parallel apps. No admin for main profile. I'll probably end up using like 10 user profiles lol
19:08:56 <strcat[m]> TAsn (EteSync): we're unlikely to consider bundling apps unless there is some advantage to them being in the base OS
19:09:12 <strcat[m]> TAsn (EteSync): SeedVault can backup to apps providing a storage provider, doesn't need them to be in the base OS
19:12:13 <TAsn> My point was about making it accessible. Making it easy. Making it part of the new device setup. At the moment users install Graphene and don't have a way to sync their data. Compare that to the Google/Apple experience. It's just miles away in terms of usability to have an easy way to set things up compared to telling users to go figure it out.
19:12:13 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps explains in more detail
19:12:31 <TAsn> Thanks, will take another look at that
19:12:41 <strcat[m]> TAsn (EteSync): our goal is not to provide more bundled apps just for convenience
19:12:50 <strcat[m]> there has to be a reason to do that because there are serious drawbacks to including more apps
19:13:41 <strcat[m]> and apps need compatible licenses to consider it
19:13:50 <strcat[m]> GPLv3 is incompatible with making a device based on GrapheneOS with an immutable root of trust
19:13:53 <TAsn> Yeah, the licensing thing someone else mentioned earlier, though that can be solved.
19:14:03 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 is fine although we prefer permissive licenses
19:15:27 <TAsn> I think that this is not the same as bundling in games or some stupid apps that some people need. I think it's more akin to having a dialer pre-installed.
19:16:03 <strcat[m]> Dialer needs to be included for compatibility
19:16:16 <strcat[m]> there is a test suite and document defining what has to be included by default
19:16:43 <strcat[m]> we're unable to provide good apps ourselves for everything that must be included already
19:16:52 <strcat[m]> there are issues filed on the tracker about replacing those apps already
19:17:07 <TAsn> Syncing your contacts, calendars, tasks and etc is core to the mobile experience, and this enables something like a "graphene account" that will let users also sync their configs, sync their backups and essentially have a similar experience to what's there in Apple/Google. Essentially making a privacy phone that's actually usable.
19:17:49 <strcat[m]> I don't think needing to install an app for the user's preferred sync service makes the device any significantly less usable
19:17:58 <strcat[m]> SeedVault is included in the base OS
19:18:05 <strcat[m]> and it can sync to the user's service of choice
19:18:51 <strcat[m]> I do think we need a package manager frontend in the base OS and we have an issue open about developing one
19:19:07 <strcat[m]> and then we could have maintainers for certain high priority apps in our own repository
19:20:03 <strcat[m]> that has to be included in the base OS in order to give it automated update privileges
19:20:12 <trismous[m]> Personally I use on my S10e (stock) Nextcloud to sync contacts, calendar etc.
19:20:44 <TAsn> trismous: nextcloud could also be an option in the first-run wizard. In fact, it probably should be due to how popular it is.
19:20:58 <strcat[m]> there are several apps we need to develop or replace already: package manager frontend, gallery, calendar frontend, music playback (does not need much of a UI), search provider (does not need much of a UI) and others
19:21:18 <strcat[m]> there has been no progress towards this so far
19:21:29 <strcat[m]> and there are not suitable apps available we could simply bundle
19:21:59 <strcat[m]> also kinda need a new camera app and Open Camera would need a lot of work to be good enough
19:26:19 <TAsn> Yeah, there's a lot of work involved in building an OS, no doubt. Especially if you have to re-implement a lot of the basic utilities due to licensing limitations.
19:26:31 <strcat[m]> we can't offer to install apps in the SetupWizard until we have a package manager frontend
19:26:51 <strcat[m]> and we can't use F-Droid, it's GPLv3 and also not suitable as a base for what we want, which requires a lot more minimalism and robustness
19:27:08 <strcat[m]> we can't trust F-Droid with privileged permissions
19:27:26 <TAsn> Yeah, I read that github issue earlier
19:27:44 <strcat[m]> and it can't be considered a first party app source when it lets you add repos and treats them the same as first party instead of differently
19:27:50 <strcat[m]> it breaks the OS first party source feature
19:28:10 <strcat[m]> if you give it the privileged background install permission
19:28:15 <TAsn> Those are fair enough. Though I think even having a "You can now sync your contacts, calendars and tasks using NextCloud/DAVx5/EteSync" would already be a good start.
19:28:46 <TAsn> Yeah, having your own app-store will solve a lot of issues.
19:29:19 <TAsn> Btw, have you considered using the F-Droid backend and just building a new user-facing app for it? I understand you may have ideas on how to improve f-droid too, but this would probably be a quick way to get to where you want
19:44:05 <TAsn> As I said above, I think that it can be more than just a "sync your contacts" kind of thing. There's a lot of benefit in syncing the list of apps a user has, their configurations and etc. All of which require deeper integration than just installing an app.
19:44:32 <TAsn> Let's leave it at that for now. I planted the seed in your brain, we can chat again at a later time.
19:44:40 <TAsn> Best of luck with everything, and keep up the good work!
20:20:11 <besamim5781[m]> <dazinism "I do use shelter, but don't gran"> Same
20:29:35 <dazinism> TAsn (EteSync): GrapheneOS uses seedvault that currently backs up app data for apps that allow it (same as Googles Android backups & adb)
20:30:15 <dazinism> Also backs up all your android settings (including stuff like WiFi passwords)
20:30:18 <strcat[m]> yeah SeedVault is intended to be how we sync everything and it is service-agnostic
20:30:29 <strcat[m]> any service with a storage provider works
20:30:56 <dazinism> contacts, calendar (which may include tasks), call-logs
20:31:27 <dazinism> Are all arriving soon. Also file backups
20:32:12 <dazinism> Currently it offers for backups to be on usb flash or nextcloud
20:32:13 <alzxjm[m]> dazinism: This only allows syncing to GrapheneOS devices though, right?
20:32:26 <alzxjm[m]> Or devices which use Seedvault, rather.
20:33:10 <dazinism> They are happy to add more cloud providers. Takes some work in the cloud app to properly support Seedvault (a seedvault dev made changes to nextcloud)
20:35:22 <dazinism> alzxjm: yeah only devices which have seedvault, but its just been added to LineageOS and other custom ROMs are adopting it, so its set to be the 'standard' for many AOSP / non-Google android devices
20:35:57 <alzxjm[m]> EteSync and CardDAV/CalDAV are cross-platform, so different goals.
20:36:51 <dazinism> TAsn (EteSync): I think folks would like it if EteSync was added to seedvault as a cloud provider.
20:37:11 <alzxjm[m]> I see what you mean.
20:38:09 <dazinism> Seedvault does encrypt backups, but some metadata (the names of apps it has backed up) is not encrypted
20:38:40 <dazinism> Guess Etesync would hide that data
20:38:49 <dazinism> *that metadata
21:18:04 <ruddo[m]> For a while, backing up to Android Samba Client would work fine with Seedvault, but now Android Samba Client no longer works in Android 11, and sadly that has brought ASC support for Seedvault backups to an end.  Tragic.  I bet it's like a 3-line code fix to get that to work again.
21:18:40 <ruddo[m]> And who doesn't have / can't set up a NAS or file share, if you have a laptop, desktop, or server computer?
21:18:51 <ruddo[m]> No complicated Nextcloud or Etesync setup.
21:26:28 <strcat1> ruddo[m]: does it no longer work on Android 11 in general
21:26:30 <strcat1> or just on GrapheneOS
21:26:57 <ruddo[m]> I tested on GOS, can't tell you about boring Android.
21:27:00 <strcat1> we have some compatibility fixes in the development branch for exec spawning in Android 11
21:27:15 <strcat1> TBI-based memory tagging was getting enabled for all apps instead of only API 30+ apps
21:27:21 <strcat1> and some apps have bugs that this uncovers
21:27:30 <strcat1> in C and C++ code
22:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat somebody is pretending to be you
22:08:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat1
22:08:37 <strcat[m]> no
22:08:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh
22:08:49 <renlord> look at the flag
22:08:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Huh
22:08:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wtf
22:08:57 <renlord> strcat1 (~strcat@archlinux/fellow/thestinger)
22:09:07 <renlord> *cloak
22:09:12 <strcat[m]> I got disconnected from IRC so `strcat` was taken
22:09:15 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: looks like he's identified properly, just must have connected twice.
22:09:17 <renlord> what a beautiful cloak
22:09:20 <strcat[m]> so the client uses `strcat1`
22:09:26 <TheJollyRoger> Makes me want one!
22:09:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry false alarm
22:09:36 <renlord> can we get a grapheneos cloak?
22:09:37 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: fellow is for former developers, etc.
22:09:41 <TheJollyRoger> Hehe, no problem! Concern's understandable.
22:09:44 <TheJollyRoger> Oh I see.
22:09:57 <TheJollyRoger> I just wanted something besides my crummy old "tor sasl" one.
22:10:03 <strcat[m]> probably
22:10:05 <renlord> same!
22:10:12 <strcat[m]> renlord: dunno how it works
22:10:17 <strcat[m]> probably have to ask freenode staff
22:10:18 <strcat[m]> unsure
22:10:26 <TheJollyRoger> Maybe something like @thehighseas or something like that, ha ha ha!
22:10:37 <strcat[m]> you can get an unaffiliated cloak
22:10:38 <strcat[m]> btw
22:10:49 <TheJollyRoger> Oh hey that's a good idea. I'll go and look into getting one of those.
22:10:51 <strcat[m]> https://freenode.net/kb/answer/cloaks
22:10:59 <TheJollyRoger> Woohoo, thanks!
22:11:23 <strcat[m]> > Once you've read and understood the above, if you would like an unaffiliated cloak, please join the #freenode channel or speak to a member of the staff team. Note that cloaks are a privilege, and staff have the right to deny that privilege to users if they deem necessary.
22:11:44 <renlord> strcat[m]: i think only you can ask for one since you own the grapheneos namespace
22:11:49 <strcat[m]> > For project cloaks, a registered GC for the project needs to contact staff to request the cloak be added to the desired user.
22:11:55 <strcat[m]> I don't know what a registered GC means
22:11:57 <strcat[m]> I own the channel
22:12:08 <renlord> afaik, you own the #grapheneos namespace
22:12:10 <strcat[m]> but I haven't officially confirmed anything
22:12:14 <renlord> since you can create #grapheneos-*
22:12:24 <strcat[m]> yeah but I haven't officially confirmed that it's the official GrapheneOS channel
22:12:29 <TheJollyRoger> Oh uh... crap. I handed over all the founder statuses for the other channels, right?
22:12:33 <TheJollyRoger> I... I thought I did.
22:12:36 <renlord> o_O it says in topic
22:12:37 <renlord> LOL
22:12:40 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: probably did
22:12:44 <TheJollyRoger> Whew!
22:13:14 <TheJollyRoger> The only one I'm parking so far is "-beta" but I set the topic on that one to "Sorry, we're closed! Come back later" or something.
22:13:42 <TheJollyRoger> That one I reserved for future use, it's not open at the moment.
22:29:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys we need more people to test changes to carrierconfig
22:29:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are many people who don't have volte and WiFi calling working on graphene
22:29:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some US carriers don't even have signal
22:29:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need testers who can help confirm it works
22:30:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> You'll be flashing an unofficial test build so you will lose data during the testing
22:30:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Please pm me
23:08:57 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> Is the best place to donate still Github or should we change it?
23:09:27 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> strcat:
23:11:03 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: GitHub Sponsors is the best way to do recurring donations
23:11:32 <strcat[m]> PayPal has recurring donations but GitHub Sponsors goes directly to my bank account and doesn't involve dealing with PayPal
23:11:44 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat[m] "yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: GitHub Spons"> Well that's what i'm doing. So great
23:11:50 <strcat[m]> there is no longer donation matching since the $5000 of matched donations via GitHub Sponsors was already paid out
23:12:01 <strcat[m]> but I still prefer getting money through it than PayPal
23:12:07 <strcat[m]> since with PayPal I have to regularly go deal with it
23:12:08 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat[m] "there is no longer donation matc"> Yeah, i remember something about that. That's why i asked :)
23:12:15 <strcat[m]> and PayPal tends to freeze accounts etc.
23:12:40 <strcat[m]> most people are probably donating USD and GitHub Sponsors passes through the USD to my USD bank account
23:12:59 <strcat[m]> if you're actually donating CAD directly then it would be a bit more efficient to use PayPal
23:14:12 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat[m] "if you're actually donating CAD "> Well it's USD. Whatever you prefer though. I just want to support the project. Not even actively using it. But this project is important and need to live. Trying it on and off
23:14:22 <strcat[m]> GitHub Sponsors is ideal then
23:55:02 <r0tt0r[m]> on resurrection rom i think i saw that network  permission is divided to be set for wifi/mobile/vpn access, would be great addition as currently in case vpn goes down app still has network access in case vpn isnt enabled to be forced connection
23:55:19 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: no, that's not the same thing
23:55:32 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: they don't provide an equivalent to the Network permission, you're incorrect about what that is and what it does
23:55:57 <r0tt0r[m]> oh ok
23:56:12 <strcat[m]> the Network permission on GrapheneOS doesn't just disable direct network access
23:56:14 <Remu[m]> <r0tt0r[m] "on resurrection rom i think i sa"> It's not even a permission, but is a java configuration on settings, iirc
23:56:32 <strcat[m]> it disables indirect access via APIs requiring the standard Android INTERNET permission
23:56:42 <strcat[m]> a firewall-based implementation is incomplete in that regard
23:56:53 <strcat[m]> the feature you're talking about is not a comparable one
23:57:20 <strcat[m]> the INTERNET permission determines the granularity
23:57:34 <strcat[m]> there is not a separate permission for Wi-Fi and mobile data, etc.
23:58:02 <strcat[m]> so an app forbidden from using Wi-Fi could still use it via an API guarded by the INTERNET permission
23:58:05 <strcat[m]> that approach doesn't really work
23:58:22 <r0tt0r[m]>  understand though any firewall like af+ possible that doesnt use vpn interface?
23:58:35 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: you're confusing a data limiting feature with a privacy/security one
23:58:52 <strcat[m]> r0tt0r: not clear what you're asking now
