09:14:07 <jcb[m]> Where can I find information about which code in GrapheneOS is NOT free software (as defined by FSF)?
10:12:59 <Sheru[m]> Apparently, GrapheneOS has reached Japanese people as well, unsure if the translation of grapheneos.org is that accurate (deepL says it is near enough)

10:16:44 <neo[m]5> Hi, guys. While building GrapheneOS by executing "m target-files-package" building broke because I didn't have enough space. I quit my virtual machine, provided big storage for it, returned to it, resized partition by gparted. Then I typed once again "m target-files-package", but received error:
10:16:44 <neo[m]5> m: command not found
10:16:44 <neo[m]5> I called it from grapheneos folder. What am I doing wrong?

11:52:40 <lpcvoid[m]> yoda__1: this feels a bit like advertisement imo
11:54:08 <yoda__1> lpcvoid[m], I understand but it is not, I don't get anything for sharing that.  A lot of people using GOS lives in countries where it's difficult to use VPN and I didn't know about that nordvpn feature before today (didn't noticed before). So I though it was a nice place to share that info. But you are probably right....
11:55:21 <lpcvoid[m]> Not fronting you, was just a feeling haha
12:10:20 <p00l00p[m]> it has its place on offtopic for sure
12:10:32 <aeonsolution[m]> yoda__1: please don't recommend VPNs on this channel. It is off-topic.

13:58:22 <Sheru[m]> Could be dropped on GrapheneOS this month or after December, unsure
13:59:52 <jaxson[m]> Thanks!
14:29:35 <dazinism> Same as they did last year with the Pixel 1
14:44:14 <dazinism> Was kind of hoping they may extend it a bit more, particularly as they spent the effort to get 11 working on the device.
14:44:53 <dazinism> Wonder if the 3 may get longer or if this will be the trend
16:30:02 <mntr0jannyforjes> pixel5 just came out
16:34:47 <louipc> not supported by grapheneos (yet?)
16:37:09 <burningdaemon[m]> How long is the pixel 3 supported?
16:38:42 <louipc> one more year
16:42:00 <burningdaemon[m]> OK thx
16:42:17 <burningdaemon[m]> So until 2022?
16:42:52 <louipc> 2021

22:38:26 <haterade[m]> I just did the SIM lock but the implementation is bugged and now I'm locked out of my phone lol
22:39:09 <mrxx_0[m]> What do you mean by doing the sim lock ?
22:39:46 <haterade[m]> in security settings, you can set a SIM pin lock
22:39:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> [mrxx_0](https://matrix.to/#/@mrxx_0:matrix.org) you can do a sim pin from settings
22:40:24 <haterade[m]> In grapheneOS 10 the option did noting, but it became responsive in grapheneOS 11, so I thought I'd try it out. But it's broken
22:40:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> [haterade](https://matrix.to/#/@haterade:matrix.org) how did it break
22:41:34 <mrxx_0[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[mrxx_0](https://matrix.to/#/@mr"> Wanted to make sure that was that
22:41:52 <haterade[m]> I'm getting a new SIM card now. I enter the SIM code and it immediately becomes PUK locked (which is the same lock as when you incorrectly enter the pin 3 times). The carrier gave me a PUK code, which unlocks it and asks for a new pin. Then when I enter the new pin, it immediately becomes PUK locked again.
22:42:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> [haterade](https://matrix.to/#/@haterade:matrix.org) thanks for the report. I am looking into it
22:52:05 <haterade[m]> Frustrating because I have to wait a week to get a new SIM and I had plans ðŸ˜­
22:55:24 <haterade[m]> I read about the FBI exploiting the phones of protesters in portland, so I wanted a SIM lock ..
22:58:13 <haterade[m]> Thx for investigating anupritaisno1. It should probably be disabled until fixed ..
