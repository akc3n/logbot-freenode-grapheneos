01:26:57 <strcat[m]> also going to be trying out DeskClock from master in the development branch - not sure if it even builds, we'll have to see
01:27:06 <strcat[m]> but the app is being very actively developed in master and was rewritten in Kotlin
01:59:14 <Bramble> The audio on my pixel 3 with GrapheneOS on it only plays through the phones speakers even when I plug in my wired earbuds
02:01:46 <Bramble> didn't mean to do that
02:01:52 <Bramble> can anyone help me
02:02:16 <strcat> btw doing a substantial change to AttestationServer will be down for a bit
02:02:29 <strcat> and worse case scenario I made a backup of the current state (right now) and can roll back to that
03:54:53 <strcat[m]> alright updating clock app seems to work
03:54:56 <strcat[m]> might have new bugs
03:57:12 <ricky19> Hey I'm guessing this happens a lot
03:57:26 <ricky19> Wondering if the pixel 4a will be supported Soon?
03:57:47 <ricky19> P.s not gone on irc in years
03:57:56 <ricky19> Discord these days it's like slack but better
04:06:32 <strcat[m]> updating Clock app doesn't seem like it will turn out well so not doing that
04:06:34 <strcat[m]> causes more problems
04:15:48 <Sourcream61[m]> Does anyone here recommend making a second profile for downloading apps with trackers like from Aurora store?
04:17:31 <Resynth[m]> <strcat[m] "btw next release will re-enable "> Oh my fucking god I love you
04:24:27 <Sheru[m]> Lol, maybe it just happens to belong to the same code with Logout
04:24:33 <strcat[m]> you can already just take them with power + vol down right now, or use screenshot button in recent apps
04:24:54 <strcat[m]> Sheru: not really but they are both global action dialog things
04:24:59 <strcat[m]> logout also shows up on lockscreen
04:25:28 <strcat[m]> AOSP still supports the screenshot option in the global actions dialog
04:25:47 <strcat[m]> was just disabled by default because they expect people to use gesture navigation
04:25:55 <strcat[m]> where you swipe up and there's a button
04:25:59 <strcat[m]> to screenshot
04:26:07 <strcat[m]> (full gesture navigation, not 2 button navigation)
04:26:27 <Sheru[m]> <strcat[m] "updating Clock app doesn't seem "> That's unfortunate, was weirded out on SDK min greater than target SDK (on DeskClock)
04:27:11 <strcat[m]> they're separate things
04:27:46 <Sheru[m]> <strcat[m] "logout also shows up on lockscre"> Wondering how will that appear on holding power button now there are more than three buttons there by default
04:29:02 <strcat[m]> the reason for one issue with deskclock
04:29:06 <strcat[m]> is that a bot sabotaged it
04:29:12 <strcat[m]> the guy who worked on it wanted to land a fix for Android 11
04:29:17 <strcat[m]> but the bot kept reverting it wrongly
04:29:27 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/DeskClock/+log/2668d8066a9c25ff7214b91419e8f6f3e6253b2c
04:29:28 <strcat[m]> look
04:29:42 <strcat[m]> stupid fucking bot
04:29:49 <strcat[m]> anyway I applied that fix
04:29:53 <strcat[m]> it builds fine
04:30:13 <strcat[m]> 'Automerger Merge Worker <android-build-automerger-merge-workerâŠ™sgc>	'
04:30:26 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_packages_apps_DeskClock/commits/11
04:30:28 <strcat[m]> easier to see here
04:49:57 <Sheru[m]> That was some weird series of commit and revert
04:55:32 <strcat[m]> Sheru: the bot was reverting it
04:55:34 <strcat[m]> so it didn't ship as intended
04:55:38 <strcat[m]> bot was broken
05:00:11 <strcat> ideally we could just drop in a compatible, up-to-date gallery app
05:00:16 <strcat> but I don't see any option available
05:00:24 <strcat> could get desperate and use the CAF one
05:27:04 <gofigga[m]> Is there a way to disable the screen from turning on when i plug in the phone to charge?
05:33:46 <renlord> gofigga[m]: yes, you turn it off
06:24:15 <gofigga[m]> <renlord "gofigga: yes, you turn it off"> Ah forgot about that extra step. Thanks
06:24:30 * renlord chuckles
06:49:34 <broda721[m]> Is there a way to block a certain domain system-wide? Like how on iOs you can block certain domains from opening on any app
06:49:44 <broda721[m]> Or would I have to install an app such as Netguard
07:00:45 <renlord> broda721[m]: not really, netguard doesnt work properly
07:00:53 <renlord> best to delegate to your DNS provider via private DNS mode
07:33:10 <sphinxcat[m]> <broda721[m] "Is there a way to block a certai"> seems like a planned feature: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/184
08:29:54 <Sheru[m]> <sphinxcat[m] "seems like a planned feature: ht"> Low-priority tbh
08:30:41 <Sheru[m]> Well, nextDNS as  DNS over TLS is the closest one can achieve it anyways
08:31:32 <Sheru[m]> Some improvements/control/convenience in multiple users is more useful and feasible
08:39:18 <bbqcore[m]> Hi I see hardened_malloc is available for Linux
08:39:52 <bbqcore[m]> What would be the benefits of installing it on my main computer for daily browsing etc?
08:42:01 <renlord> bbqcore[m]: using libhardened_malloc is part of security hardening
08:42:41 <renlord> say the program buffer overflows but does not error out, libhardened_malloc catches it and causes it to error out instead
08:42:54 <renlord> *does not error out using a std allocator
08:43:24 <renlord> not erroring out can have unintended side effects which may (not) have security implications down the track
08:43:54 <bbqcore[m]> renlord: hardened_malloc is available in AUR on Manjaro
08:44:17 <bbqcore[m]> I can install it to enhance security on a normal computer?
08:44:28 <renlord[m]> Sure.
08:44:39 <renlord[m]> I think it's in the community repo in arch now.
08:45:44 <bbqcore[m]> ERROR: One or more PGP signatures could not be verified!
08:45:44 <bbqcore[m]> Failed to build hardened_malloc
08:46:23 <renlord[m]> Report to the aur package maintainer.
08:46:48 <renlord[m]> Neither of us maintain it.
08:47:34 <bbqcore[m]> Ok how will this affect performance?
09:17:31 <renlord> bbqcore[m]: i dont think you will notice until you ran perf benchmarks
09:17:57 <renlord> and those % differences dont necessarily translate to degradation in perceived UX.
09:18:12 <renlord> all in all "how will this affect performance" is a bad question to ask
09:18:33 <renlord> unless you have a very specific usecase
09:20:41 <bbqcore[m]> just wondering if there's any use in running it on daily rig
09:21:16 <renlord> the degradation in perceived UX will probably stem from insecure software breaking down more than usual
09:21:32 <renlord> but thats not hardened_malloc's fault, rather its the software vendor's
09:21:34 <renlord> lol
09:23:11 <bbqcore[m]> sounds like a good thing
09:23:47 <renlord> bbqcore[m]: if it sounds good to you then run it!
09:23:54 <renlord> hehe
09:24:03 <bbqcore[m]> will do once PGP is fixed :)
09:38:25 <madaidan[m]> IME of using hardened_malloc on Arch systemwide, it has a hefty performance loss unless you disable some of the more expensive security features.
10:31:47 <anupritaisno1[m4> [bbqcore](https://matrix.to/#/@bbqcore:matrix.org): I run it on my daily

13:01:03 <captain_nem0[m]> Hi guys I need some help with flashing the rom on my Pixel 3a
13:01:51 <captain_nem0[m]> I posted on reddit but automod told me to come here
13:02:22 <captain_nem0[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/j5ir40/flashall_command_returns_fastboot_too_old_message/
13:02:40 <captain_nem0[m]> Any help would be nice
13:44:10 <mrxx_0[m]> <captain_nem0[m] "https://www.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> I don't see the picture on reddit, you posted something else with the title ?
14:28:48 <maddo> Hello, I wanted to buy a pixel device, I can technically wait a few months so I wanted to ask: should I buy the 4 now or should I wait for 4a/5 support coming?
14:30:02 <maddo> I understand graphene is supported by volunteers and so on, I'm no android expert unfortunately, so just from a consumer perspective is it worth the wait? (5G isn't coming here for at least 4-5 years and I don't see any hardware advancements except screen on the 5)
14:31:46 <maddo> also another info (again I'm no android expert): I've read that grapheneOS doesn't bundle play services or its "foss implementation" microG, how does it handle notifications?
14:52:35 <kopolee11[m]> <maddo "also another info (again I'm no "> To answer this question, apps can use their own notification system not reliant on Google Play Services. If an app is in F-Droid or it's marked as "GSF Independent" in the Aurora Store then it will generally work. (I'm not qualified to say how it works exactly)
14:52:46 <kopolee11[m]> * To answer this question, apps can use their own notification system not reliant on Google Play Services. If an app is in F-Droid or it's marked as "GSF Independent" in the Aurora Store then it will generally work. (I'm not qualified to say how it works exactly)
14:52:46 <kopolee11[m]> Even some apps that rely on GSF notifications will work without it, due to using a fallback if GSF is not detected. Signal and WhatsApp are notable examples of that. You may have to have "not optimized" battery options enabled however.
14:52:46 <kopolee11[m]> And of course other apps will work in general, but not have notifications working. Slack is an example of that.
14:53:10 <bbqcore[m]> anupritaisno1: is the AUR maintainer in here?
14:54:32 <maddo> kopolee11[m]: whatsapp notifications don't really work on my smartphone and I have microG right now, how can they work without anything?
14:54:47 <maddo> (unfortunately, my family refuses to switch over to anything else)
14:55:25 <telum[m]> Some apps just need to run in the background, and will give notifications. I.e. Signal, Tutanota, etc.
14:55:40 <telum[m]> Takes a bit more battery, but consumption is good overall on GOS anyways.
14:57:41 <kopolee11[m]> <maddo "kopolee11: whatsapp notification"> I don't use WhatsApp, but I believe it's supposed to work without GSF. However if you have microG running it won't use the failback method, instead it will try to use the GSF method.
15:02:40 <maddo> thank you, any suggestion on my other question?
15:03:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> <bbqcore[m] "anupritaisno1: is the AUR mainta"> For?

15:12:41 <nscnt> maddo: What's your goal? If you want to use GrapheneOS now, the Pixel 4 is your best bet. There's no guarantee that GrapheneOS will be supported on the Pixel 4a or 5 as long as no one is working for it. However, I think anupritaisno1[m4 is working on test builds for the 4a.

15:22:06 <maddo> nscnt: my goal is actually simply replacing my current phone. I have a s7e, which is starting to feel old and sluggish (and could use a new battery), I wanted something that would last quite a while. I'm no phone gamer, I only use a phone for basic needs (browsing the web, chatting and some banking apps that require 2FA)
15:22:15 <maddo> nothing more

16:37:48 <zachmartin[m]> New user here. Surprised you aren't hosting your own home server.
16:39:20 <zachmartin[m]> Just got Pixel 3a running Graphene and like it so far.
16:51:25 <zachmartin[m]> Can FB and Instagram still get your location data when only on cell service?
16:56:15 <jpds> zachmartin[m]: You can block an app's access to location services, but they'd probably just infer it from your IP
17:01:57 <zachmartin[m]> jpds okay, I have denied location for all apps, as well as background data, and am running always on VPN. Have also changed DNS to Cloudflare although I think that's default now.
17:03:26 <zachmartin[m]> What is the difference in "Sensors" and "Location" in permissions? They both have the same location symbol.
17:04:43 <jpds> I believe sensors covers things like the compass, gyroscope, etc
17:11:02 <fomijafi[m]> zachmartin: DNS default is network-provided with a fallback to cloudflare. So, if you're on a VPN, DNS would be provided by the VPN provider by default. I believe leaving that is recommended to reduce hands in the pot.
17:40:12 <zachmartin[m]> <fomijafi[m] "zachmartin: DNS default is netwo"> Okay, thanks, wasn't sure ProtonVPN used their own DNS server by default.
17:40:45 <zachmartin[m]> <jpds "I believe sensors covers things "> Okay, def denying that
17:44:14 <norwegian-keys> hello folks! i'm typing on a norwegian keyboard using the included grapheneos keyboard, but i am getting red lines below almost every single word and when i click them, english suggestions appear
17:44:28 <norwegian-keys> relly annoying stuff. i've tried turning off correction and suggestion but to no avail
17:44:43 <norwegian-keys> any suggestions as to what i should do?
17:46:18 <tipsyturtle[m]> In the Language and Input settings,  under advanced, there is an option for AOSP spell checking - maybe turning that off will work?
17:47:20 <norwegian-keys> thanks, that did the job!
17:50:23 <norwegian-keys> btw, on my old 1st gen pixel (using the stock google os), dark mode turned the backgrounds on most of my apps to complete black (#000) which i think looks quite nice on the amoled display. however on my pixel 3a on grapheneos, the dark mode only turns my display a dark gray. is there any way to make it completely black like on my old pixel?
18:18:22 <arept> hey, just got my pixel 4a.
18:19:02 <arept> went into the settings, toggled developer etc but oem unlocking was greyed out
18:19:46 <arept> i know graphene isnt supported yet but if oem unlocking is greyed out im not able to ever install right?
18:22:42 <arept> is google locking by default now?
18:22:48 <strcat[m]> arept: make sure it's not a Verizon model
18:22:49 <strcat[m]> no, they aren't
18:22:58 <strcat[m]> unless you bought a Verizon model you can unlock it
18:23:03 <strcat[m]> read what we say in the install guide
18:23:04 <arept> pretty sure it isnt verizon
18:23:24 <strcat[m]> so you can unlock it
18:23:28 <ruski[m]> is it locked to a provider at all?
18:23:44 <textmate> Whats the status on Pixel 4aÃž
18:23:46 <textmate> ?
18:23:48 <arept> strcat[m]: oem is greyed out
18:24:02 <strcat[m]> only a Verizon Pixel is bootloader locked
18:24:08 <strcat[m]> arept: connect to the internet
18:24:13 <arept> ooh
18:24:18 <arept> do you have to be connected?
18:24:26 <strcat[m]> arept: also look at the model of the phone
18:24:36 <arept> i was offline if that is a problem
18:24:56 <strcat[m]> arept: depends
18:24:57 <strcat[m]> is this used
18:25:05 <arept> no brand new pixel 4a
18:26:27 <strcat[m]> just try connecting to the internet per https://grapheneos.org/install
18:26:36 <strcat[m]> not necessarily required
18:30:59 <arept> oufff thank you man it works just had to connect to the internet was kinda worried thanks a lot dude
18:32:32 <arept> now i just have to wait for the release
18:34:53 <norwegian-keys> arept: sorry to say, it might be a while
18:35:25 <Sheru[m]> Testers were wanted on 4a iirc
18:35:32 <Sheru[m]> (Not sure about now)
18:41:01 <zachmartin[m]> Going to get a 3a XL next
18:42:41 <norwegian-keys> zachmartin[m]: is it expensive?
18:48:46 <BalooRJ> Just a question for those more familiar with the project. What can you say to someone who is skeptical that there is Google firmware in the Pixel phone chips that can be accessed even with GrapheneOS loaded
18:53:54 <engulf[m]> If you cannot trust the firmware provided (also by Qualcom etc.) and signed by Google you are kind of f**** as then you cannot trust the root certs either.
18:54:53 <engulf[m]> Titan M is open source but its near to impossible to verify that its running the code
18:56:12 <zachmartin[m]> <norwegian-keys "zachmartin: is it expensive?"> Found one on Craisglist for 200
18:56:51 <JTL> > 11:54 <engulf[m]> Titan M is open source but its near to impossible to verify that its running the code
18:56:53 <JTL> OTOH the "same" problem applies to older open source Yubikey's
18:56:55 * JTL sigh
18:59:35 <engulf[m]> There are always at least few companies that you have to trust to some degree when it comes to computing
19:04:00 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: there are no open hardware phones, so your alternative is not using a phone
19:04:27 <strcat[m]> or a computer in all likelihood - what are you going to use that's not 99% closed source hardware and firmware?
19:04:42 <strcat[m]> there are some options but not x86 or arm
19:04:48 <strcat[m]> and not a phone
19:05:13 <anupritaisno1[m4> Are they secure though
19:05:25 <anupritaisno1[m4> I'd assume those open architectures get audited a lot less
19:06:01 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: also just because something is closed source doesn't mean it's a black box - an ARM SoC is essentially a black box, but firmware for various peripherals, etc. can be inspected (although the hardware cannot really)
19:06:17 <strcat[m]> anyway that applies to open source hardware too, you still trust the manufacturer as much as before
19:06:26 <strcat[m]> you can't prove it really matches what it was supposed to be
19:06:38 <strcat[m]> and as I said before, there are no open hardware phones
19:06:49 <BalooRJ> Thanks very much, that's very helpful information.
19:06:51 <strcat[m]> there are no open hardware ARM SoCs of course since it's a proprietary architecture
19:07:08 <BalooRJ> NVidia owns the architecture at the moment I believe right?
19:07:25 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: and I don't know what firmware you're talking about anyway, it's a Qualcomm SoC device, the trusted party is primarily Qualcomm and the manufacturer of the phone (Foxconn)
19:07:57 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: I don't know if NVIDIA has actually acquired it yet, I doubt it
19:08:10 <strcat[m]> that would all have to be approved by governments and go through that process
19:08:16 <anupritaisno1[m4> Might be good if they do
19:08:21 <engulf[m]> RISC-V is probably one to keep an eye on
19:08:34 <anupritaisno1[m4> Nvidia had some good source releases for their phones AFAIK
19:09:16 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: peripheral components are not trusted by the SoC / OS in general, at least to the extent possible (i.e. a touchscreen is trusted to display the provided frames and provide input)
19:10:08 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: so for example the Titan M just provides specific features, it doesn't have any control beyond implementing the APIs it is supposed to implement
19:10:29 <strcat[m]> and the way that's integrated into encryption uses it for additional security, it does not trust it or move responsibility to it
19:10:39 <BalooRJ> that's also very good to know.
19:10:49 <strcat[m]> it is used to add an extra feature (exponentially increasing delays for decryption attempts throttled by hardware with minimal attack surface and insider attack protection)
19:10:56 <strcat[m]> suggest reading about it
19:11:41 <strcat[m]> and the other APIs it implements (a more secure alternative to the traditional TEE-based keystore still used by most apps that use the keystore, etc.)
19:13:10 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: so you can be skeptical all you want but the end result of that is you can't use computers, or you accept that you trust the manufacturers of the devices to have not put in backdoors or whatever
19:13:57 <BalooRJ> I am not skeptical myself, I was just touting the project and trying to defend it from critiques of "Well it runs on a Google Pixel anyway"
19:14:17 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't just run on Pixels
19:14:57 <anupritaisno1[m4> Pixels are the only phones to actually satisfy many of the requirements
19:15:02 <strcat[m]> it officially supports those because they offer the best privacy/security available from firmware/hardware other than an iPhone which does not support running another OS (without exploits, which doesn't count, since you won't be running it securely with the same hardware-based security features)
19:15:18 <anupritaisno1[m4> Along with timely security patches
19:15:22 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: if people want to run it on another phone they are free to support that
19:15:41 <strcat[m]> on the vast majority of phones it's not going to meet our standards and so there is no path to official support
19:15:53 <BalooRJ> makes sense.
19:16:03 <anupritaisno1[m4> BTW it doesn't work, spoilers
19:16:16 <strcat[m]> we aren't going to support a device that chooses not to support alternative OSes securely, which is most of the devices that support installing another OS
19:16:17 <anupritaisno1[m4> I've tried running graphene on many non pixels
19:16:22 <anupritaisno1[m4> Most will barely boot
19:16:33 <strcat[m]> they cut corners by not supporting hardware-based security with other OSes
19:16:46 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it will run fine on modern devices but that's not the problem
19:16:52 <anupritaisno1[m4> Hardened malloc often kills almost every HAL on several xiaomis
19:17:45 <strcat[m]> the problem is they aren't secure: they mostly don't provide proper security updates, and those that do have much weaker firmware/hardware privacy/security and force you to use the stock OS to get all the hardware-based security features
19:18:04 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: bugs uncovered by hardened malloc and other mitigations are not really the main issue, that can be worked around
19:32:36 <anupritaisno1[m4> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: bugs uncovered by"> How many will you work around?
19:33:13 <strcat[m]> it's not really about # of bugs
19:33:36 <strcat[m]> we're capable of temporarily using jemalloc for a process while fixing / reporting bugs in a process
19:33:44 <strcat[m]> used to do that in several cases
19:33:47 <strcat[m]> used to do that in several cases
19:45:35 <zachmartin[m]> Does Graphene support the 90hz refresh rate on the Pixe 4 XL? Just want to double check.
19:50:40 <anupritaisno1[m4> [zachmartin](https://matrix.to/#/@zachmartin:matrix.org) yes
19:54:48 <TheLynx> hello everyone
20:01:11 <broda721[m]> Hey
20:01:52 <TheLynx> Just a short question tried (just for science) to run the Google Maps App from my GrapheneOS phone, since this app is just using the website under maps.google.com to get the routing information at the first start you just have to name the app a browser app and tahts it
20:02:43 <TheLynx> nevertheless I cant cat it to get my current location when I give the app all permissions and activate the GPS function in the pull down menu
20:03:25 <TheLynx> Than I realized that I cant use location services in any browser I'm using Not in Vandadium, Brmoite or Brave
20:03:42 <TheLynx> does anybody has the same problem or a soulution for this?
20:18:01 <strcat[m]> did you grant location permission to the browser and then to the site in the browser?
20:18:22 <TheLynx> Both yes, but I will recheck it again
20:18:37 <TheLynx> I use Vanadium only for google maps currently
20:19:40 <xabi[m]> <TheLynx "does anybody has the same proble"> Have you tried native alpha? It now supports location for web apps
20:21:48 <TheLynx> Native Alpha you mean the software branche`
20:23:19 <TheLynx> Im just running the stable version of grapheneos
20:28:43 <zachmartin[m]1> <zachmartin[m]1 "Vanadium > DDG ?"> Why funny xabi ?
20:28:50 <zachmartin[m]1> Trying to learn more about it
20:29:49 <TheLynx> Hmm, checked everything again sould work other apps have access to the my current location as well
20:30:07 <xabi[m]> Vanadium is good enough, i dont see anything i need on ddg browser, that is my particular case
20:30:58 <TheLynx> Hmm, checked everything again sould work other apps have access to the my current location as well. But I cant get the bowoser to get my location from the gps
20:31:20 <TheLynx> The ring does not start swirling on maps.google.com
20:32:02 <xabi[m]> <TheLynx "Native Alpha you mean the softwa"> https://github.com/cylonid/NativeAlphaForAndroid. This app works like creating a web app in desktop from chromium based browsers but it includes granular permisions for different sites/webapps. They added location setting recently
20:34:51 <zachmartin[m]1> <xabi[m] "Vanadium is good enough, i dont "> Okay, thanks. *uninstalling ddg* lol
20:35:36 <zachmartin[m]1> I only used of previously bc I wanted incognito keyboard
20:35:59 <xabi[m]> <zachmartin[m]1 "Okay, thanks. *uninstalling ddg*"> Its my personal opinion, less layers is better if you can live without them. You can use ddg from vanadium anyway.
20:38:50 <zachmartin[m]1> Okay, I'll keep ddg as the default search engine.
20:44:33 <TheLynx> xabi[m]: Thanks for the tip sounds nice. But still, why is it not possible to get your location in vanadium or other browers
20:44:36 <TheLynx> ?
20:45:55 <Solaslux[m]> Hi everyone. I looked at the os-issue tracker and didn't see my problem there. Is this an okay place to ask a question about a problem?
20:51:27 <TheLynx> The funny thing this only affects browes in other apps it is absolute no problem to get the location. I also checked the site settings and the search settings and unblocked google in vanadium
21:00:16 <TheLynx> *browsers
21:00:25 <strcat[m]> xabi: Chromium already includes granular permissions - not sure why you'd need another app for that
21:13:49 <xabi[m]> <strcat[m] "xabi: Chromium already includes "> Do settings inside chromium stick when you create a shortcut "webapp"?
21:16:29 * xabi[m] uploaded an image: 400019600415_406426.jpg < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/kjLHFcDfMnigguhgfnrhETbJ/400019600415_406426.jpg >
21:18:33 <strcat> xabi[m]: it works the same as it always does
21:19:27 <strcat> xabi[m]: you do not need some third party webview-based app to control permissions for web sites
21:19:29 <strcat> that doesn't make sense
21:20:04 <xabi[m]> Good to know! Tried google maps and location doesn't work anyway
21:20:06 <strcat> you seem to have a misunderstanding about what 'add to home screen' does in Chromium-based browsers
21:20:17 <strcat> it doesn't magically grant them permissions
21:20:35 <strcat> they aren't really an app the browser just presents them as one
21:20:46 <strcat> it's still within the browser and all the usual things apply
21:21:02 <strcat> if you clear browser cookies your cookies in that pinned web app will be gone
21:21:09 <strcat> it doesn't change how things work
21:21:12 <strcat> it just changes how it is presented
21:21:27 <xabi[m]> Doesn't using the webview separate the cookies from normal browser?
21:21:42 <strcat> the webview is a different thing than the browser
21:21:56 <strcat> webview is a per-app library/widget
21:22:30 <strcat> it is an implementation detail if it uses the same browser engine
21:22:58 <strcat> and btw in GrapheneOS for Android 11 we are not yet providing a Vanadium-based WebView until Chromium 86
21:23:23 <strcat> and the WebView is not quite as secure as the browser, the sandbox it uses isn't quite as strong
21:23:23 <xabi[m]> I don't need to wipe cookies and logins from amazon, Facebook, strava and Garmin connect but I don't like them with my browsing history
21:23:41 <strcat> xabi[m]: web sites don't have access to your browsing history
21:24:05 <strcat> anyway not really sure what you mean
21:24:21 <xabi[m]> Ok, so leaving that app aside moving back to vanadium
21:24:44 <strcat> you can use that if you want you just don't need it to control permissions per site, etc.
21:24:47 <strcat> dunno why you'd think that
21:27:21 <xabi[m]> I thought that vanadium webview was just as secure as browser
21:28:58 <strcat> xabi[m]: suggest reading https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
21:29:16 <strcat> and also as I said we aren't currently using the Vanadium WebView until Chromium 86 which has official Android 11 support upstream
21:29:33 <strcat> xabi[m]: WebView is also a widget/library for apps to use
21:29:54 <strcat> xabi[m]: Vanadium has a per-site sandbox with isolation boundaries between sites
21:30:38 <strcat> xabi[m]: WebView uses 1 sandboxed renderer per app, there's semantic-level separation between different WebViews if that is how they use them but there is still 1 sandboxed renderer process
21:31:09 <strcat> in theory the WebView could have finer-grained sandboxing but the WebView works differently than the browser and it would have to be done in a way that doesn't break the way the WebView API works
21:32:37 <xabi[m]> Read that sections before installing graphene, it s well explained and as a I see webview doesn't offer site isolation
21:33:24 <strcat> xabi[m]: WebView is totally separate between 2 different apps using it
21:33:35 <xabi[m]> I think that I need to read it every now and then not to get back to the old habits xD
21:33:46 <strcat> but within the same app using it, it doesn't provide OS sandbox level separation between each WebView widget / each form of content rendered in it
21:33:52 <strcat> and the WebView is not strictly for rendering web sites
21:34:00 <strcat> it's up to the app how to use it and the rules that are in place
21:34:08 <strcat> and they can expose their own APIs to the web content within it
21:34:25 <sjekk-igjen> which could be a vulnerability?
21:34:30 <strcat> so some apps use the WebView to implement a web browser, some use it to display a specific site
21:34:38 <xabi[m]> I see, good to get things clear first hand
21:34:40 <strcat> but others use it to render beyond just standard web content
21:34:52 <xabi[m]> Thanks for the support
21:34:55 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: sure an app is responsible for security of their code as always
21:35:14 <strcat> they can expose whatever APIs they want to the WebView
21:35:35 <strcat> there are various lints and decorators designed to prevent making mistakes but there is a limit to what that can do
21:35:46 <strcat> ultimately up to developers to preserve a security boundary if there is supposed to be one
21:36:08 <sjekk-igjen> strcat: can grapheneos attempt to enforce these boundaries in any way?
21:36:08 <strcat> an app might choose to be implemented in HTML/CSS/JavaScript using the WebView and expose all the APIs it needs to that WebView instance
21:36:17 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: I don't know what you mean
21:36:23 <strcat> we don't know how apps are meant to be designed
21:36:47 <sjekk-igjen> strcat: right
21:36:48 <strcat> I don't see how we could improve this
21:37:22 <sjekk-igjen> strcat: you'll have to forgive my ignorance, i'm not very experienced with mobile operating systems and app design i'm afraid
21:37:27 <strcat> and even if we knew that the app was intending to treat the WebView as a security boundary, we can't automatically verify / change their code
21:37:44 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: the WebView is a widget / library for apps to use for web content - not necessarily web sites, but web content in general
21:37:50 <strcat> it's not really something specific to mobile
21:38:23 <strcat> this is widely done on desktops, apps just provide their own copy of CEF or Electron which is not automatically updated as part of the OS, the difference here is that the OS provides a standard library for apps to use
21:38:50 <strcat> and the standard library always uses the OS sandbox (unlike CEF / Electron where many applications disable it)
21:39:10 <sjekk-igjen>  ah, i understand. as long as developers has access to and can use this library, there is always the possibilty that something could go wrong
21:39:16 <strcat> but it's still up to the app if they *want* the WebView to be a security boundary and it's up to them to choose what it can access
21:39:27 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: well it's their code...
21:39:33 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: we didn't write their app for them
21:39:39 <sjekk-igjen> strcat: indeed
21:39:52 <strcat> the OS doesn't know how they intend to use the library and doesn't have an understanding of what they are doing with it
21:40:19 <strcat> if they really wanted they could bundle their own web rendering widget such as Mozilla's GeckoView
21:40:31 <strcat> and then it's the app's responsibility to keep applying browser security updates every few weeks
21:40:36 <anupritaisno1[m4> Hmmmmm sentient OSes
21:40:36 <strcat> because they are the ones shipping it
21:40:49 <strcat> and it's their responsibility not to disable security features (I don't think GeckoView has an OS sandbox anyway)
21:41:10 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: the WebView is for web content in general - not just untrusted remote web sites
21:41:48 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: it's common to use it only to load web assets from inside your apk and you can give the code running in it access to the app's files and content URIs it can access
21:42:00 <sjekk-igjen> which could be as simple as an svg, right?
21:42:03 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: it's just a portion of the app implemented via web standards
21:42:12 <xabi[m]> Do you see scoped storage as a big improvement for android 11?
21:42:22 <strcat> scoped storage was added with android 10
21:42:23 <xabi[m]> Or is it more of a gimmick?
21:42:32 <strcat> android 11 just adds some enhancements and makes it mandatory for API 30+
21:42:34 <strcat> it's not a gimmick
21:42:52 <xabi[m]> Good!
21:43:33 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: an app can choose to use the WebView with a browser-like model, by default it doesn't have things like cookies, they have to set that up
21:43:40 <xabi[m]> * Good! Android 11 makes it short of mandatory, right?
21:43:50 <strcat> xabi[m]: it's mandatory for API 30+ as I said
21:44:20 <strcat> Play Store currently requires new apps and app updates to use API 28+, but that becomes 29+ in a month
21:44:45 <strcat> GrapheneOS shows a warning when launching an app targeting below API 28 for the first time (the stock OS shows the warning for apps below API 23)
21:45:01 <strcat> it's up to you if you want to run apps targeting older API levels with weaker privacy/security restrictions
21:45:12 <strcat> we don't disable support for it, that's your choice
21:45:30 <strcat> F-Droid has a lot of legacy / poorly maintained apps targeting old API levels, they don't enforce a standard like the Play Store
21:45:58 <strcat> an app developer cannot upload a new app or an update to an existing app to the Play Store targeting an API level below 28 (soon 29)
21:46:15 <sjekk-igjen> I have gotten that warning for applications included with grapheneos
21:46:17 <strcat> takes ~1.4 years for a newly launched API level (like 30) to become mandatory for the Play Store
21:46:19 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): should we make it 29?
21:46:32 <xabi[m]> When an app says that it was designed for an older version of android means that it
21:46:32 <xabi[m]> Uses an older api?
21:46:34 <anupritaisno1[m4> There's an selinux domain for 29 now
21:46:57 <strcat> sjekk-igjen: because not all of the bundled apps are actively developed
21:47:01 <strcat> some of them are just sample apps
21:47:13 <strcat> so you might have a misunderstanding about the purpose and status of those bundled apps
21:47:16 <strcat> if that surprises you
21:47:31 <strcat> Gallery and Calendar are sample apps - you are not really supposed to use those
21:48:05 <sjekk-igjen> i'm guessing the sample apps have been thoroughly checked for vulnerabilities then
21:48:27 <strcat> they still receive security updates
21:48:34 <sjekk-igjen> oh i see
21:48:50 <strcat> they're sample apps, their purpose is primarily to be samples and to allow standard functionality to be tested
21:49:03 <strcat> the expectation of AOSP is that we replace them
21:49:18 <sjekk-igjen> but if i'm not mistaken you are in fact planning to replace them at some point, no?
21:49:27 <strcat> look at the issue tracker
21:49:41 <xabi[m]> I use stock gallery on some profiles, what do you recommend?
21:49:55 <strcat> whatever your preferred gallery app is
21:50:01 <strcat> I'm not going to make app recommendations on request
21:50:24 <anupritaisno1[m4> No
21:50:30 <anupritaisno1[m4> <sjekk-igjen "but if i'm not mistaken you are "> No
21:50:51 <anupritaisno1[m4> With what could we replace them exactly?
21:50:55 <strcat> if there was a decent Gallery app that was minimal, well maintained and had a suitable license for us to include we would have replaced it
21:50:58 <xabi[m]> OK, something that doesn't come from tencent will be good enough xD
21:51:00 <strcat> same goes for the Calendar app
21:51:16 <strcat> not aware of anything we could use in either case right now
21:51:19 <anupritaisno1[m4> There aren't enough people to do that
21:51:29 <strcat> Etar is GPLv3, simple gallery is GPLv3, so neither is an option
21:51:38 <anupritaisno1[m4> We can't use lineage's stuff either as they inject their sdk everywhere
21:51:44 <xabi[m]> Is snapdragon gallery closed source?
21:51:47 <strcat> and we can't just remove Calendar and Gallery because they provide standard functionality that is tested by the test suite
21:51:49 <anupritaisno1[m4> And we don't want it
21:51:49 <strcat> xabi[m]: no
21:52:13 <strcat> xabi[m]: it's from far being minimal / security-focused, it does really crazy things
21:52:20 <strcat> it isn't an unprivileged, normal app
21:52:28 <strcat> it's a tech demo, really
21:52:32 <strcat> like a lot of those CAF apps
21:52:43 <strcat> it exists to demonstrate fancy hardware capabilities
21:52:51 <strcat> it is not a good idea to actually use them
21:52:59 <xabi[m]> Ah
21:53:11 <xabi[m]> Got it from omnirom store
21:53:39 <anupritaisno1[m4> >omnirom
21:54:09 <xabi[m]> * Got it from omnirom store, moving back to camera roll. Idk if it s still updated
21:54:31 <strcat> Snapdragon Gallery won't fully work without being built into the OS as a privileged app
21:54:36 <strcat> and it's kinda insane
21:54:43 <strcat> I looked at it a few days ago as a possible alternative to Gallery
21:54:45 <strcat> and it's not

21:55:29 <strcat> first of all, still targets API 23, that's horrible, you couldn't even upload that to the Play Store (requires 28+)
21:55:46 <strcat> and the permissions it requires are insane
21:55:58 <strcat> it has to be a privileged app built into the OS with whitelisted privileged permissions to get all that
21:56:03 <anupritaisno1[m4> Gallery needs to write APN settings
21:56:06 <strcat> it can't get it as a third party app
21:56:09 <anupritaisno1[m4> Legit
21:56:17 <strcat> yeah as I said
21:56:19 <strcat> it's insane
21:56:21 <strcat> it's a tech demo

21:56:56 <strcat> anupritaisno1[m4: LineageOS Gallery2 is this merged into the AOSP Gallery2 or something

21:58:26 <anupritaisno1[m4> [boogaloo](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_boogaloo:matrix.org) yeah pm me
21:58:29 <boogaloo> anupritaisno1[m4: thematrix.org one
21:58:30 <strcat> it has integration into APNs
21:58:32 <strcat> it's really weird
21:58:41 <strcat> anyway I'd definitely avoid that insane Snapdragon Gallery app
21:59:05 <strcat> Qualcomm likes making these apps as tech demos
21:59:20 <strcat> they have bad usability, lots of outdated / legacy code, legacy API levels
21:59:30 <strcat> just meant to demonstrate cool hardware capabilities etc
21:59:45 <strcat> they are essentially another form of sample app meant to show off hardware capabilities and show how to use them
21:59:47 <strcat> for other app devs
22:00:12 <strcat> I think the idea is that a vendor would use this as a reference to make a Gallery app supporting some of those features as desired
22:00:54 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_strcat:matrix.org): you know what
22:01:00 <anupritaisno1[m4> Instead of all this bs

22:01:12 <boogaloo> anupritaisno1[m4: I'min the bootloader on the phone, and trying to flash graphene on windows 10 (virtualbox), the script hangs and is just waiting for device (<waiting for devices>)
22:01:13 <anupritaisno1[m4> Users should just go to their favorite place
22:01:25 <strcat> https://grapheneos.org/faq#bundled-apps
22:01:27 <strcat> covers this
22:01:31 <anupritaisno1[m4> And get a gallery app they like
22:01:35 <strcat> I don't see it as our responsibility to find the best in class app and bundle it
22:01:38 <strcat> and then deal with problems it has
22:01:43 <anupritaisno1[m4> End of story
22:01:59 <anupritaisno1[m4> This is too irritating
22:02:14 <anupritaisno1[m4> <boogaloo "anupritaisno1: I'min the bootloa"> Don't use virtualbox
22:02:26 <boogaloo> my host is linux mint
22:03:11 <boogaloo> anupritaisno1[m4: I tried the shell script but it doesn't work either
22:03:33 <boogaloo> anupritaisno1[m4: both on linux and on thevm
22:03:46 <anupritaisno1[m4> [boogaloo](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_boogaloo:matrix.org) then use it
22:03:59 <systemctl[m]> why are gplv3 not viable options?
22:04:02 <anupritaisno1[m4> Just
22:04:30 <anupritaisno1[m4> I can't do a remote session rn
22:04:53 <systemctl[m]>  * strcat: why are gplv3 not viable options?
22:05:07 <anupritaisno1[m4> In the middle of testing and I have sensitive stuff in my clipboard. Passwords and so on
22:09:32 <hitchhooker[m]> systemctl: it is not permissive license. If you use gpl3 in project everything has to be gpl3. https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bjixvu/comment/em8sjus
22:10:42 <strcat> systemctl[m]: because GPLv3 has restrictions which forbid using GrapheneOS in ways we want to allow it to be used
22:10:54 <strcat> systemctl[m]: GPLv3 would forbid taking GrapheneOS and making a locked down device with it
22:11:01 <strcat> we don't want to forbid that, we want it to be permissively licensed
22:11:14 <strcat> GPLv2 is fine, GPLv3 is not, we won't include any GPLv3 code in the OS
22:11:33 <strcat> a GPLv3 tool that doesn't taint the OS with GPLv3 is fine but we would prefer permissively licensed tooling too
22:12:31 <strcat> systemctl[m]: note that most of those apps are using GPLv3 because they want as restrictive of a license as possible while still being considered FOSS
22:13:01 <strcat> systemctl[m]: lots like Etar were originally based on Apache 2 code and then made the license more restrictive in a way that it can no longer be used by the permissively licensed projects they started from
22:13:30 <strcat> and BTW projects like OpenBSD consider even GPLv2 to be a non-free license, the definition varies based on who you ask
22:13:40 <strcat> OpenBSD doesn't like Apache 2 either though
22:14:31 <anupritaisno1[m4> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_strcat:matrix.org) what about wtfpl?
22:14:45 <strcat> that's fine
22:15:13 <strcat> for us, GPLv2 is fine, but concerning, especially if they use "GPLv2 or later" since they might move to GPLv3 only
22:15:30 <strcat> so if a project is GPLv2 or later, we would prefer to avoid that too, unless upstream is committed to not moving to GPLv3 only
22:15:37 <strcat> because I don't want to bundle something and be cut off from updates
22:15:43 <strcat> which BTW would have happened with simple gallery and etar
22:15:47 <strcat> they switched their licenses to GPLv3
22:15:52 <strcat> they were originally Apache 2
22:16:18 <strcat> and since those 2 licenses are compatible they were able to just switch over for new releases without asking everyone for permission
22:21:16 <boogaloo> Im trying to flash graphene on linux mint - I got the latest platform tools from android,but the script just says - that flashboot is too old????
22:21:49 <strcat> make sure that's the fastboot you are using
22:21:57 <strcat> follow the instructions in a single shell exactly as written there
22:22:05 <wdnsdy[m]> verify your fastboot --version
22:22:05 <strcat> run `which fastboot` and `fastboot --version` as it recommends
22:23:13 <boogaloo> strcat: ah ok - it seems Im running fastboot version 1:8.1.0+r23-5ubuntu2
22:23:39 <TheLynx> Question is a bit offtopic but for the whole channel what do you think about the brave browser? I guess it has less secuity becuase of the missing site isolation, but what do you think about the privacy features?
22:24:13 <strcat> ask in #grapheneos-offtopic
22:24:34 <TheLynx> ahh, didn't knew this # existed
22:24:41 <strcat> boogaloo: there is no fastboot 8.1.0, that's a made up Ubuntu version and is super outdated
22:25:14 <strcat> they took the AOSP android-8.1.0_r23 tag and built it from there - that's incredibly old, and AOSP OS releases are not the tags for platform-tools
22:25:27 <strcat> i.e. they built that from out-of-date Android 8.1 code - Android is on Android 11...
22:26:26 <wdnsdy[m]> unless you are on arch Linux, don't use android-tools from repos
22:26:55 <TheLynx> Ok, but again to my issue with location services in browsers/Maps Go is this a known issue tha location services does not work in Vanadium?
22:26:55 <boogaloo> strcat: ahh - bit rusty in linux. Its at ust/lib/android-sdk - I suppose I have to get the sh to usethe included version Idownloaded?
22:27:08 <strcat> boogaloo: just follow the instructions from the top
22:27:12 <strcat> exactly as they are provided there
22:27:15 <strcat> it covers doing this
22:27:26 <strcat> it covers getting up-to-date fastboot and setting PATH for the current shell
22:27:31 <wdnsdy[m]> quite tiring to see always same problem, wouldnt happen if people actually knew how to read
22:29:53 <TheLynx> wdnsdy[m]: I see, the installation manual is very well written and the installation quite easy...
22:30:33 <strcat> we eventually want to have a web-based installer for people not familiar with CLI
22:30:46 <strcat> but the CLI instructions do cover everything - if you run exactly the commands that are there it will work
22:31:10 <strcat> on Linux distributions without proper udev rules for fastboot you can do those parts with root
22:32:10 <louipc> :O
22:32:50 <strcat> development branch is now based on the October update other than the kernels
22:32:54 <strcat> still waiting for those tags to be available
22:33:15 <louipc> i wonder how the heck web installer would work. sounds freaky
22:34:50 <strcat> louipc: web usb
22:35:05 <wdnsdy[m]> something like etcher then ?
22:35:07 <strcat> louipc: https://flash.android.com/
22:35:14 <strcat> https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/flash
22:35:26 <strcat> it's supported by the Pixel 2 and later
22:35:29 <strcat> WebUSB
22:35:39 <louipc> omg why fffs
22:36:00 <strcat> so we could have a grapheneos page like this that asks for WebUSB permission and then flashes GrapheneOS to a phone
22:36:08 <strcat> for people that aren't verifying the signify signature it's no less secure
22:36:24 <strcat> WebUSB asks you to grant permission to access a specific device to the site
22:36:37 <louipc> oh what a tangled web we weave
22:37:04 <boogaloo> strcat: Thanks - got it. :)
22:37:23 <louipc> yea if it already exists why not i guess
22:38:37 <strcat> this monthly update has a decent amount of non-security bug fixes
22:38:40 <strcat> looking through them atm
22:42:16 <anonymous821[m]> Hi all, I recently upgraded to RP1A.200720.009.2020.10.01.23. I am now noticing that I am always getting an sms like reminder for my alarm 30 mins prior to the actual scheduled time. Is there a way to turn this off? Also, at times the alarm does not trigger when it is supposed to. Most recently the alarm triggered 30 mins after the scheduled time (or anytime I unlock my phone after the scheduled time). Is anyone
22:42:16 <anonymous821[m]> else having the same issue?
22:42:40 <strcat> the Clock app got substantial updates in Android 11, it has some rough edges
22:42:43 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: what does sms-like mean? a notification?
22:42:46 <anonymous821[m]> Also, despite the upgrade, I am still not receiving sms alerts unless my phone is unlocked. Though sometimes I receive an sms alert,but delayed alert at a random time, sometimes a few mins, sometimes 10mins or even an hr.
22:42:46 <strcat> will need to put in some work to address the issues
22:44:13 <anonymous821[m]> <renlord "anonymous821: what does sms-like"> instead of the actual alarm beep, it is like an sms alert
22:44:36 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: wew, i havent had that with my alarms.
22:44:53 <renlord> can you set a soon-ish alarm and then collect some logs?
22:45:03 <renlord> then create an issue?
22:45:37 <anonymous821[m]> renlord: how do i generate the log?
22:45:52 <anonymous821[m]> > <@freenode_renlord:matrix.org> anonymous821: what does sms-like mean? a notification?
22:45:52 <anonymous821[m]>  * instead of the actual alarm beep, it is like an sms alert tone
22:46:05 <renlord> generate a bug report -- toggle in dev options
22:46:36 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: can you check if that sms alert tone is your default notification jingle?
22:47:13 <strcat> there are a few fixes for the Clock app in the upcoming release
22:47:19 <strcat> more fixes are needed
22:47:35 <strcat> we tried updating to the overhauled Clock app in master but that didn't work well
22:47:41 <strcat> so we'll need to backport fixes or do them ourselves
22:48:57 <strcat[m]> a lot of fixes are needed for the sample Gallery app, it's quite broken ATM
22:49:06 <strcat[m]> DeskClock mostly works but has some rough edges atm
22:49:16 <anonymous821[m]> renlord: sorry, can you pls guide me to navigate to the dev options section, and also the default notification jingle
22:50:11 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you think it'd be a good idea to just expose 'capturing a bug report' in settings without toggling dev options?
22:51:04 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes, and I think there's a way to add support for submitting them more easily
22:51:12 <strcat[m]> something we have to look into at some point
22:52:10 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: tap 10 times on phone info, until it says 'you're a developer'
22:52:22 <renlord> pls turn off dev options when you're done
22:52:43 <renlord> otherwise if you dont know what you're doing at all, just dont do it
22:53:16 <lev[m]> <anonymous821[m] "Hi all, I recently upgraded to R"> oh dang, that happened to me too actually; I woke up before my alarm once and it sounded, but I later thought I'd just dreamed that
22:53:38 <lev[m]> let me see if I can reproduce
22:54:03 <strcat[m]> don't need to reproduce that the notifications make sound
22:54:04 <strcat[m]> we know
22:54:16 <strcat[m]> you can disable it manually, ideally it would be set up more sanely by default
22:54:28 <lev[m]> notifications of an impending alarm?
22:54:36 <strcat[m]> as I said, the Clock app had major changes in Android 11
22:54:38 <strcat[m]> it has rough edges
22:54:42 <strcat[m]> help wanted to fix those
22:54:44 <lev[m]> maybe I've just never observed that behavior before, but that seemed strange
22:55:01 <strcat[m]> lev: it makes notifications of impending alarms and since Android 11 it has sound by default
22:55:02 <strcat[m]> we know
22:55:13 <anonymous821[m]> <renlord "anonymous821: tap 10 times on ph"> i tapped "build number" and now a developer, how do i retrieve the logs for the alarm?
22:55:18 <strcat[m]> you can figure out which channel is which and disable the sound
22:55:37 <lev[m]> huh, interesting
22:55:55 <strcat[m]> long press the notification and you can configure them
22:56:00 <strcat[m]> if you press on the channels you can configure them
22:56:01 <lev[m]> it's rare enough that it doesn't impact my life, but good to know it can be avoided
22:56:03 <strcat[m]> as with other notifications
22:56:11 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: 2nd option down -- bug report
22:56:24 <strcat[m]> the way the notification channels are set up by default is annoying
22:56:32 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: next time when it happens, push that
22:56:38 <renlord> and generate an interactive report
22:56:41 <strcat[m]> it was already annoying in Android 10 though, it's just more annoying now that more notifications make sound by default now
22:57:05 <strcat[m]> only way that's going to change is if people submit clean patches to improve DeskClock
22:57:12 <strcat[m]> the changes in the master branch can be used as a guide / reference
22:57:36 <strcat[m]> when other downstream projects are finally using Android 11 we could share work on this kind of thing with them
22:57:47 <strcat[m]> for now we're pretty much on our own
22:59:20 <anonymous821[m]> <renlord "anonymous821: 2nd option down --"> how do i navigate this? is it in settings, or in the clock app itself?
22:59:43 <renlord> anonymous821[m]: Settings > System > Developer Options > Bug Report
23:06:57 <anonymous821[m]> renlord: i just dloaded it, where it it normally saved?
23:09:43 <strcat[m]> we really don't need captured bug reports for the clock app
23:09:47 <strcat[m]> we're aware of the issues already
23:09:53 <strcat[m]> need development help
23:12:00 <anonymous821[m]> ok
23:13:58 <anonymous821[m]> i am also having issues with sms alerts as well, i do not receive them unless my phone is unlocked, though sometimes i receive delayed sms, can be a few mins to an hr
23:14:24 <anonymous821[m]> it has been an issue since i started using grapheneos
23:21:53 <strcat[m]> did you start using it when it was still based on Android 10? or more recently
23:32:29 <anonymous821[m]> when it was still android 10 i think
23:32:49 <anonymous821[m]> i have used it for a few months
