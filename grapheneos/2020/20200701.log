00:01:03 <sheruleeya[m]> Right now, the threat model is comapnies, government, hackers, snoopers/stalkers and data brokers in no particular order
00:01:18 <cn3m[m]> thats everything mate
00:01:23 <cn3m[m]> maybe a phone is not for you?
00:01:27 <sheruleeya[m]> Higher priority on those who can compromise more
00:01:27 <cn3m[m]> or a PC that's even worse
00:01:27 <hypokeimenon[m]> government?
00:01:53 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "maybe a phone is not for you? "> Not exactly, some are on lower priority though
00:01:59 <hypokeimenon[m]> government?
00:02:02 <TheJollyRoger> Instead of thinking of actors, start thinking about their possibilities.
00:02:26 <TheJollyRoger> Or rather, what they can do or /would do/.
00:02:26 <sheruleeya[m]> Well, alright, will do that next.
00:02:35 <TheJollyRoger> Because if "government" is in your threat model, then consider this:
00:02:43 <TheJollyRoger> India has nuclear weapons at their disposal.
00:02:56 <sheruleeya[m]> nearest threat is ISP and companies who try to profile the person through data collection methods
00:03:55 <sheruleeya[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Because if "government" is in yo"> They're in a "medium" tier somehow, just trying to limit what they know about me
00:03:59 <TheJollyRoger> So if "government" is in your threat model and you don't consider the possibility that maybe you're not a big enough target to waste a strategic weapon on, you're never going to be satisfied with your threat model and you're just going to end up stressing about it for no reason.
00:04:13 <TheJollyRoger> I'm exaggerating for the purpose of illustration.
00:04:27 <TheJollyRoger> But that's why it's important to play it like you would a hand of cards. You have to know when to fold 'em.
00:04:57 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, I mean it's definitely not worth it.
00:04:57 <sheruleeya[m]> Sure, they are on my "threat model", but mostly I only show them what I want to show them, something like that
00:05:30 <mxnorvak[m]> <renlord "a humorous youtube clip on our b"> This was great lol
00:06:00 <cn3m[m]> I am watching more
00:06:06 <renlord> ye, there's quite a bit of shitfuckery every now and then
00:06:06 <cn3m[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bleyX4oMCgM
00:06:12 <cn3m[m]> this was funny
00:06:32 <sheruleeya[m]> Maybe there's a better term than threat model, but I'm having a picture of something like that
00:06:52 <cn3m[m]> We need Edward Snowden to get rich and buy us all an island
00:07:03 <renlord> cn3m[m]: its also illegal to not vote in australia
00:07:12 <renlord> you get fined for not voting in an election
00:07:21 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "We need Edward Snowden to get ri"> Agree
00:07:29 <renlord> everyone is enrolled in the electoral roll when they turn 16
00:07:48 <mxnorvak[m]> <renlord "cn3m: its also illegal to not vo"> Whaaaat ?
00:08:02 <renlord> yep, you get a fine if you miss an election
00:08:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah don't you have to pay a $25 fee if you don't cast a ballot?
00:08:29 <renlord> and it is very rigorously enforced by the electoral comission
00:08:30 <mxnorvak[m]> <renlord "yep, you get a fine if you miss "> That's some next level democracy
00:08:44 <renlord> but most aussies are encouraged to vote since they get a "democratic sausage sizzle"
00:09:11 <cn3m[m]> Why??
00:09:25 <renlord> cn3m[m]: why what?
00:09:39 <cn3m[m]> would you need to pay to not vote
00:09:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> > you get fined for not voting in an election
00:09:54 <cyborgninjaneer[> NGL, that's kind of cool
00:10:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> Not sure that it's good, but kind of cool
00:10:39 <cn3m[m]> does anyone have an old Pixel build for GrapheneOS?
00:10:40 <renlord> cn3m[m]: im guessing its so that vote suppression cannot occur without fucking people up
00:10:57 <renlord> if people have to pay a fine when they are voter suppressed, then they are more likely to complain
00:11:09 <renlord> so its less likely for voting suppression attempts to be successful
00:11:23 <renlord> voting is so accessible in australia, its a fkin joke if you complain about not being able to vote
00:11:27 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "cn3m: im guessing its so that vo"> that is fair honestly
00:11:40 <renlord> but voting suppression is **rampant** in the USA
00:12:25 <renlord> and since people are so busy with their daily lives, they are less likely to complain about voting suppression and never becomes a national issue
00:12:56 <renlord> so i think the compulsory voting and fine is well-justified
00:13:14 <cn3m[m]> renlord: You see it as voter suppression, but we see it as focusing on the quality of polling places
00:13:37 <renlord> cn3m[m]: why do you need quality in polling places?
00:13:38 <renlord> @_@
00:13:49 <renlord> dont you just cast a ballot and fuck off?
00:14:37 <cn3m[m]> you changed my mind
00:15:14 <renlord> i measure quality of polling places by requisite time spent at a polling place.
00:15:17 <renlord> the less, the better
00:15:30 <renlord> i've never seen a queue in an australian polling station
00:16:02 <cn3m[m]> I was be facetious
00:16:04 <cn3m[m]> being*
00:16:25 <cn3m[m]> it's racist imo when you cut polling places in black areas more than white areas
00:16:38 <renlord> i thought i saw a YT clip that some polling places in the USA had a buffet or some shit
00:16:51 <renlord> and people hung around for a full meal w. drinks and shit
00:17:03 <renlord> so i thought it was a serious suggestion lulz
00:17:21 <cn3m[m]> that sounds very american
00:18:51 <cdesai> LMAO, really?
00:19:07 <cdesai> here we have lines (due to the population), but it's still quick anyway.
00:19:17 <cn3m[m]> Oh, no I am referring to cunttuckey's polling closing www.politifact.com/article/2020/jun/23/whats-happening-polling-places-kentucky/
00:20:52 <renlord> https://youtu.be/E_Nszf_LLPc
00:20:53 <TheJollyRoger> ...oh man.
00:20:58 <renlord> voting suppression at its finest
00:22:57 <TheJollyRoger> renlord: I don't vote on election day, but I usually go to the advance polls because they're almost always going to be less crowded. This way I can skip the lines. In and out. Usually a really quick affair if you go early.
00:23:45 <renlord> about 30% of our votes are early votes
00:23:46 <renlord> lol
00:23:52 <TheJollyRoger> Ha, makes sense.
00:24:15 <renlord> early voting is great, it makes party campaigning less and less effective
00:24:30 <renlord> since people make up their minds way earlier and independent from party campaigns
00:24:47 <TheJollyRoger> I've often wished though if Canada could adopt a system like PunchScan, which would allow me to keep a reciept and later prove who I voted for but not without my reciept and the original ballot.
00:26:03 <TheJollyRoger> Something like that, where you have a way to verify the vote after the fact, but still retain voter confidentiality, and not have to rely on the correctness of the voting software would be really great.
00:28:24 <renlord> there was a year i think the AEC printed the merkle tree of all ballots casted for a federal district as a trial
00:28:37 <renlord> printed on a newspaper (considered to be a reliable public bulletin board)
00:28:57 <renlord> and people could verify if their vote had not been tampared with and was tallied
00:29:15 <renlord> evidently not a really successful trial since nobody bothered to verify lol
00:29:20 <TheJollyRoger> Whaaaaat aw.
00:29:24 <TheJollyRoger> T_T.
00:31:26 <greenmoon[m]> I have read that 80% of Americans never switch parties, also there is only 2 main big parties
00:31:38 <greenmoon[m]> Kinda crazy
00:31:59 <greenmoon[m]> Blues vs reds 😀
00:34:10 <cn3m[m]> I switch parties all the time. I have never been loyal or even partial to one
00:34:49 <greenmoon[m]> Are u American? You are in the 20% so 😀
00:35:08 <cn3m[m]> Haha yay I win
00:38:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> Doesn't America have Libertarians now too? So blue, red, and yellow?
00:38:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> Or is that only some states
00:38:46 <cn3m[m]> Everywhere
00:38:50 <cn3m[m]> third largest party
00:38:57 <cn3m[m]> last election almost got 5%
00:40:13 <renlord> still no preferential voting in the USA
00:40:18 <renlord> and nobody cares to introduce it
00:40:22 <TheJollyRoger> Or in Canada.
00:40:31 <cn3m[m]> Maine has it
00:40:32 <renlord> what!? canada is first past the post too?
00:40:34 <renlord> ggg
00:40:40 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, Canada is First Past The Post.
00:40:44 <renlord> and i thought canada is relatively progressive
00:40:47 <TheJollyRoger> Well...
00:40:53 <renlord> thats messed up
00:41:28 <TheJollyRoger> In their first election, the currently incumbent party promised "If we get in, this will be the last election to be run under FPTP."
00:41:39 <TheJollyRoger> They won a large majority.
00:41:39 <cn3m[m]> I don't see it as a progressive issue per se
00:41:50 <TheJollyRoger> Then immediately decided to drop the promise.
00:41:54 <renlord> lol
00:42:02 <renlord> fptp got them into power
00:42:44 <greenmoon[m]> What s funny is that the republicans used to be the liberal party and democrats the conservatives, it switched but they kept the colors, red is usually the worker/socialist party  and blue conservatives
00:43:14 <cn3m[m]> greenmoon: it's a little more complicated than that
00:43:22 <mxnorvak[m]> Pentagon has no party
00:50:45 <TheJollyRoger> If I ever ran for a political party, I think I could only make one promise: I'm going to run the country like a game of Superpower II.
00:50:54 <TheJollyRoger> Which is probably not the greatest thing...
00:51:02 <TheJollyRoger> ...but hey it'd be a promise I could damn well keep :P.
00:53:11 <TheJollyRoger> "Dude, why did you just blow up Angolia? The hell did they do to you?" "Sorry, misclicked."
00:56:13 <TheJollyRoger> (If nobody here's played Superpower II the controls in that game were notoriously finicky and unintuitive, the game was full of bugs, and the AI could sometimes make face-palmingly bad decisions.)
00:59:45 <TheJollyRoger> (But it was FUN)

12:58:35 <sheruleeya[m]> How often? Genuinely curious, since I dont use alarm as often, and a relatively new user of GrapheneOS here
12:59:17 <alzxjm[m]1> <sheruleeya[m] "Even on power-saving mode?"> Alarm works on power-saving mode.
12:59:41 <alzxjm[m]1> Battery Saver, to be precise
13:01:34 <aedlhg> Kurai correct me if I'm wrong but what I read is that the way to address it is to get a SIM card from a "decent" provider, but since providers cannot be trusted, I have to verify the SIM cards myself
13:03:57 <aedlhg> there are applications for this like SnoopSnitch, but they require specific hardware (only some smartphones are compatible), so I wanted to know if Grapheneos has something builtin that deals with SIMJacker
13:12:23 <Kurai> aedlhg to me it sounds like the os does its job by not trusting the sim card, and not having a smartphone locked to a carrier with their apps already mitigates a lot
13:13:09 <Kurai> I don't know where you read that you have to verify the sim card on your own

18:35:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: custom language pack
18:49:27 <neonfuz2> I'm curious, how do you run your own aurora server?
18:49:41 <neonfuz2> anyone have a link to the server software?
18:51:58 <nickcalyx[m]> Calyx set up a token server for them but I'm not sure if they even use it
18:54:08 <nickcalyx[m]> Aurora doesn't create anonymous accounts for you.  It has maybe 50 in a pool and then uses token servers to login and get a session token that your client can then use
19:03:48 <M5jd92[m]> Anybody using nordvpn as VPN for GrapheneOS?
19:04:03 <nickcalyx[m]> One problem is that the token servers are  fragile
19:04:23 <M5jd92[m]> i can`t find anywhere .ovpn files, they lead you only to extra android app.
19:04:45 <nickcalyx[m]> Another is that,the Aurora scheme violates Google's ToS I think
19:05:38 <nickcalyx[m]> So their anon accounts may go go or down, get locked out for too many access attempts etc
19:07:08 <neonfuz2> anyone use netguard on graphene?
19:07:24 <neonfuz2> I used to use it on my last phone but I was running a stock rom and I didn't trust half the software on it
19:07:36 <neonfuz2> (literally found spyware that came installed on it with netguard)
19:09:28 <M5jd92[m]> <neonfuz2 "anyone use netguard on graphene?"> nice one going to use it from now, if it doesn`t interfear or run normal on GOS
19:10:24 <neonfuz2> there's another similar piece of (also foss) software that I saw someone recommending too
19:10:34 <neonfuz2> one thing about netguard is it has a few paywalled features
19:10:59 <neonfuz2> idr the name right now, just saying there are a few you might want to compare
19:16:29 <jneplokh> <neonfuz2 "anyone use netguard on graphene?"> Just use the network permission
19:16:40 <jneplokh> Far better than Netguard
19:16:52 <neonfuz2> okay yeah, I was wondering if there was something built into graphene that was equivalent
19:17:03 <neonfuz2> is that like under privacy -> network or something?
19:17:49 <neonfuz2> I guess the only thing I'm missing from netguard in this case is logging / notifications when an app attempts to use internet
19:22:25 <M5jd92[m]> <neonfuz2 "one thing about netguard is it h"> Yeah if they would take my BTC they would have now 7$ more. They only accept pp
19:23:09 <M5jd92[m]> can i use for VPN .ovpn files, if yes how do i add them?

19:30:17 <jfbourdeau2> may be it's possible. I'll try when I have a minute
19:35:42 <M5jd92[m]> okay and did you ever got leaks? Because GrapheneOS has a always VPN on function and, this seems to me more reliable, ass example at booting, i would have to run NordVPN app again, but this is running from OS at startup.
19:38:18 <Kurai> M5jd92[m] you can download openvpn and use nordvpn config files if you don't want their app
19:46:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> Maybe slightly off-topic, but this is the best pool of knowledge on the subject and duckduckgo is coming up dry...
19:46:09 <cyborgninjaneer[> Has iOS come up with reliable MAC randomization yet?

19:47:24 <jfbourdeau2> I enabled the kiil swtich so there is not internet if no VPN is enabled
19:47:34 <jfbourdeau2> so Kill switch + autoConnect
19:50:25 <cyborgninjaneer[> Also, is there information somewhere about GrapheneOS' performance against RTS frame wifi tracking attacks?

19:54:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> I may have found a source on iOS. I'll post back here if it turns out useful.
19:56:21 <cyborgninjaneer[> iOS 14 may have an option to use a fake MAC address per-network.
19:57:58 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hopefully it's on by default. If you have to connect first, then turn it on, it'll be useless because the real MAC address will already be revealed. I like how GrapheneOS does it. Turn on random MAC and override per connection if desired.
20:05:35 <M5jd92[m]> <Kurai "5jd92 you can download openvpn a"> Yeah but the GrapheneOS Devs made so much effort to implement VPN out of the box. I like it more minmalistic clean an robust. I may have to the setup sometimes more. Also i trust in terms of reliabilty just because GOS vpn is deeper integrated. Like I said when i reboot the OS Vpn over settings will auto start, i don`t know how the apps will behave or how likely are to crash.

20:23:05 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <M5jd92[m] "I mean the client, which comes o"> Yeah, that's just AOSP VPN. Unsure if any improvements are made by GrapheneOS, but the VPN manager exists in all modern Android variants.
20:25:12 <M5jd92[m]> What  means AOSP?
20:25:30 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Android Open Source Project
20:25:43 <TheJollyRoger> AOSP is "Android Open Source Project." It's essentially "Android, Without Google."
20:28:11 <neonfuz2> I miss like, android 4.x
20:28:26 <TheJollyRoger> Or rather, it's Android before Google puts Play Services, its proprietary apps, and such into it.
20:28:41 <neonfuz2> they started doing stuff like replacing the default music player with google play music
20:28:56 <neonfuz2> and worse
20:30:35 <neonfuz2> I never introduced myself
20:30:51 <neonfuz2> I ran lineage os with micro G on my pixel 1 xl until like 2 months ago when a power surge killed it lol
20:31:11 <neonfuz2> I did some research and found out about graphene os and now I have a 3a with graphene, liking it so far
20:33:58 <neonfuz2> do you guys use some maps app?
20:34:07 <neonfuz2> I used to use google maps but now I'm gonna have to find a replacement
20:39:46 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: MAC randomization works properly on Pixels
20:40:52 <strcat[m]> the firmware / drivers were changed several years ago to start making it truly work
20:41:07 <strcat[m]> providing anonymity via MAC randomization requires a lot more than just randomizing the MAC
20:41:24 <strcat[m]> needs to avoid leaking it anywhere and needs to avoid having other identifiers
20:41:31 <strcat[m]> including randomizing probe sequence numbers etc
20:41:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> MAC randomization has been working since android 4.2.2
20:41:44 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: documentation covers this and has been discussed many times
20:41:48 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no
20:41:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> Simultaneous WiFi + AP has been a thing since 4.3
20:42:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> OEMs are just slow to implement it
20:42:16 <strcat[m]> it started working properly with the Nexus 5X and 1st gen Pixels when  the firmware / drivers for qca were updated to do things properly
20:42:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google isn't
20:42:26 <strcat[m]> it's a hardware / firmware issue

20:44:26 <strcat[m]> which is when it was fixed
20:44:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just that it depended on OEM support
20:45:36 <strcat[m]> The initial packet sequence number for each scan is also randomized.

21:00:52 <TheJollyRoger> jalb: Yes, but you will need to compile it from source.
21:01:14 <jalb> Oh, ok... Thanks
21:02:27 <neonfuz2> I think sometimes people make builds for certain phones, etc
21:02:35 <neonfuz2> but that would be assuming you trust whoever's building it
21:02:54 <jalb> Yeah, better compiling it
21:03:41 <neonfuz2> isn't it a bit hard to compile android?
21:03:47 <neonfuz2> I've never tried it myself

21:03:55 <neonfuz2> ya
21:04:08 <neonfuz2> maybe not "difficult" just time consuming
21:04:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> <jalb "TheJollyRoger, is it possible to"> Yes
21:04:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> There are userdebug aosp GSIs
21:04:42 <jalb> Thanks
21:05:57 <strcat[m]> we want to improve or disable Linux IPv6 non-stable privacy addresses too
21:06:03 <strcat[m]> it's really broken atm
21:06:22 <strcat[m]> privacy addresses HURT privacy when you're using full MAC rand thanks to how badly linux implements it
21:06:37 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
21:07:18 <TheJollyRoger> Sounds exactly like what happens when we start implementing ideas that sound good on paper without adequately threat modelling and thinking things through.
21:08:10 <TheJollyRoger> And then just adding code willy-nilly. Sheesh.
21:15:21 <defconanon010102> At the moment I am dealing with a display bug do app names disappear for anyone?
21:43:42 <defconanon010102> I can easily recreate the bug hold on.
21:48:56 <defconanon010102> What you have to is force stop an app and the name disappears.
21:49:20 * defconanon010102 uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200701-174405.png (428KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XchmmwhKDMuFSKvfKPFUJxzu >
21:52:39 <nscnt> defconanon010102: The name under the app icon on the home screen?
21:53:10 <nscnt> defconanon010102: e.g. there should be 'Riot'?
21:54:05 <nscnt> defconanon010102: I can't recreate it. Just force stopping the app which can be found on the home screen?
22:02:08 <defconanon010102> nscnt: It is any app when you forced stop it. RiotX should be there.
22:02:34 <defconanon010102> Also, the workaround is dragging the app. So minor issue.
22:03:29 <nscnt> The issue doesn't appear for me. If I force stop an app I have on my home screen, the name stays visible as expected.
22:04:25 <defconanon010102> nscnt: Are you on latest beta release 3a XL?
22:04:52 <nscnt> No, I'm on stable 3a (non-XL).
22:17:59 <dazinism> I'm on beta 3XL also dont get this
22:27:23 <userman23[m]> Maybe a silly question, but I installed Signal through F-droid.  Aurora Store says there is an update for Signal - Is it better to only update through F-droid, or does it make no difference?
22:38:52 <neonfuz2> there is no official signal on F-droid, so I'm not sure which build you're using. But officially there's a google play build, and a build on the signal website.
22:39:34 <neonfuz2> Pretty much for some reason the creator of signal didn't like the idea of it being distributed on F-droid
22:39:54 <neonfuz2> I think they prioritize the google play builds, like maybe that gets updated first iirc
22:40:06 <JTL> I have heard of staged rollouts
22:42:32 <strcat[m]> the Google Play build works fine on GrapheneOS
22:42:44 <strcat[m]> the only difference is that the website one is self-updating
22:45:24 <userman23[m]> Sorry, I did get it from the website - you are right.
22:46:28 <userman23[m]> strcat: when you say "website", do you mean like the actual website, or the apk downloaded from their website?
22:46:48 <jcpicard32[m]> userman23: Signal has a separate build on their website with auto-updates
22:46:54 <neonfuz2> the apk from their website updates itself by downloading a new apk from the website I think
22:47:07 <neonfuz2> the google play store doesn't check if there's a new version available, the website build does
22:48:42 <userman23[m]> Ok, awesome.  I'll have to wait and see when mine updates then.
22:49:09 <strcat[m]> it won't update itself, it will prompt you to install the update
22:49:21 <strcat[m]> third party apps can't install apps themselves
22:49:28 <userman23[m]> Oh ok.
22:52:55 <userman23[m]> Are not all apps compatible in Shelter?  I tried launching Spotify, and I just get stuck at the Spotify splash screen.
22:53:30 <strcat[m]> there is no such thing as 'in Shelter'
22:53:46 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding what that app does
22:54:19 <userman23[m]> doesn't it sandbox the app?
22:54:24 <strcat[m]> no
22:54:28 <strcat[m]> apps are already sandboxed
22:54:32 <strcat[m]> the same app sandbox is used either way
22:54:43 <strcat[m]> apps can't 'sandbox' other apps, doesn't make sense, not what that app does
22:54:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Guys seriously
22:54:59 <strcat[m]> apps cannot fundamentally alter how the OS / app sandbox works in any ways
22:55:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't use shelter
22:55:11 <strcat[m]> shelter doesn't do what you think
22:55:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've talked with the guy behind it
22:55:42 <strcat[m]> there is support for device policy managers for enterprises to manage either an entire device (device owner) or a profile (profile owner)
22:55:49 <strcat[m]> you are authorizing shelter as a profile owner
22:55:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> A lot of work is needed to solve issues
22:55:54 <strcat[m]> it is not implementing anything to do with profiles
22:56:08 <strcat[m]> it is just being put in charge as the admin of a profile
22:56:08 <strcat[m]> profiles are an OS feature
22:56:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> He doesn't have time to fix bugs
22:56:24 <strcat[m]> I would strongly recommend just using user profiles
22:56:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some pretty serious ones have been found
22:56:34 <strcat[m]> not trying to use work profiles which are intended for enterprise device management on BYOD devices
22:56:45 <strcat[m]> especially via a flaky admin app like that
22:56:49 <userman23[m]> Ok, will have to research more.
22:57:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why is matrix so slow rn
22:57:09 <defconanon010102> anupritaisno1: Well I never really trust Shelter but thanks for letting us know.
22:57:12 <strcat[m]> work profiles are meant for BYOD enterprise deployments
22:57:38 <strcat[m]> and again apps are already sandboxed either way using the SAME sandbox
22:57:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> defconanon010102: it's not trust
22:57:44 <strcat[m]> the difference is the profile they run in
22:57:56 <strcat[m]> I strongly suggest reading what has been written about profiles here and elsewhere like our subreddit
22:58:04 <strcat[m]> user profiles are fully isolated from each other
22:58:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> That guy just has a lot to do
22:58:17 <strcat[m]> work profiles are not really and it's up to the admin app how much they are isolated from the personal profile
22:58:30 <strcat[m]> you are trusting the admin app to set it up properly
22:58:37 <strcat[m]> redcat: no that works fine
22:58:41 <strcat[m]> no one said that
22:58:56 <strcat[m]> in fact I would recommend getting it from the play store
22:59:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> There's island BTW
22:59:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> It mostly works
22:59:44 <mxnorvak[m]> <strcat[m] "in fact I would recommend gettin"> Instead of the website version? Why?
23:00:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat: I think he means aurora store dropper is down
23:03:38 <defconanon010102> What is a dropper because my Aurora Store is working fine.
23:03:43 <defconanon010102> ?
23:05:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> defconanon010102: the tokenizer
23:05:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> It basically has a few accounts and randomly gives you one
23:06:33 <defconanon010102> anupritaisno1: Oh so not truly anonymous basically?
23:06:46 <strcat[m]> not what he said
23:07:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW matrix is lagging for me
23:08:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Going to check my homeserver
23:08:19 <userman23[m]> So having an app run in a user profile can be more secure than just having it run in the sandbox?  I searched for "user profile" on reddit, and closest I found was "User Profile (issues)".
23:08:19 <userman23[m]> When I think of sandbox, I think of something like a VM, which I would think is more secure.  Just curious how User Profiles are even more beneficial over Sandboxing alone.
23:08:44 <strcat[m]> userman23: apps run in the same app sandbox regardless
23:08:48 <strcat[m]> apps are ALWAYS sandboxed
23:08:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Hmmm
23:08:52 <strcat[m]> you need to understand that
23:09:09 <strcat[m]> there is no stronger sandbox available, apps are always sandboxed to the full supported extent
23:09:10 <defconanon010102> strcat: Well I am able to use an anonymous account.
23:09:36 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: again you are coming up with some weird assumption
23:09:38 <strcat[m]> based on something NO ONE said
23:09:39 <strcat[m]> just don't
23:09:43 <strcat[m]> makes things simpler
23:10:16 <strcat[m]> userman23: there are many threads about user profiles explaining them already
23:10:31 <strcat[m]> not going to repeat a whole explanation of what that provides here
23:10:47 <defconanon010102> strcat: I am just really confused is all about a tokenizer but that is my own fault.
23:10:51 <strcat[m]> and no it does not improve the app sandbox it protect the OS from the app to a greater extent, not what it does, app are ALREADY sandboxed
23:11:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> defconanon010102: maybe the server is back?
23:11:40 <strcat[m]>  * and no it does not improve the app sandbox or protect the OS from the app to a greater extent, not what it does, app are ALREADY sandboxed
23:11:47 <strcat[m]>  * and no it does not improve the app sandbox or protect the OS from the app to a greater extent, not what it does, apps are ALREADY sandboxed
23:12:06 <userman23[m]> I understand there is stuff already posted on Reddit, but tried searching for user profile, and didn't get much back.  Was just hoping for maybe a link or two.
23:12:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> userman23: all apps are sandboxed
23:12:36 <neonfuz2> would something like https://github.com/asLody/VirtualApp provide a stronger sandbox? lol
23:12:44 <strcat[m]> it's no faster for me to search for stuff
23:12:46 <defconanon010102> anupritaisno1: I would say so I mean I can connect to it. I was dealing with the same issues a few days ago. Wouldn't build the Google API and no making an anonymous account.
23:12:51 <strcat[m]> I'm not here to do searches for people
23:12:55 <neonfuz2> not suggesting VirtualApp lol
23:12:59 <strcat[m]> if you want the links to the threads you can find them
23:13:14 <strcat[m]> get better at searching / finding information instead of asking me to search for you
23:13:34 <strcat[m]> since 90% of questions asked here are answered by someone else searching for the answer for someone to link it etc anyway
23:13:49 <strcat[m]> I don't think it makes sense to constantly repeat information on these topics
23:14:01 <strcat[m]> at some point people need to read what's already written
23:14:23 <strcat[m]> there is a lot of information on multi-user / profiles on the subreddit
23:15:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well
23:15:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> I guess he could use a VM?
23:15:51 <strcat[m]> you could also read related sections like https://grapheneos.org/faq#non-hardware-identifiers
23:34:04 <userman23[m]> I assume something like this is what you are meaning: https://www.howtogeek.com/333484/how-to-set-up-multiple-user-profiles-on-android/
23:35:51 <nscnt> userman23[m]: Yes, that's what he meant.
23:36:40 <strcat[m]> there isn't a contact tracing API implementation
23:36:59 <strcat[m]> an app could use the Bluetooth + Location permissions to roll something themselves which ofc as with anything else you'd need to authorize
23:37:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> redcat: contact tracing is sadly just spyware
23:38:12 <userman23[m]> Is it best practice to have a individual user profile for each app that you don't want tracking you?
23:38:59 <nscnt> userman23[m]: As repeatately said: Apps are always sandboxed. Different user profiles have their own user space. It is an expected function that apps can share data in one profile. It's often recommended here to use different profiles to isolate apps from other apps.
23:40:46 <yxcvbnmlp[m]> <strcat[m] "there isn't a contact tracing AP"> I heared that in the next few months there could be an Android update which includes the api for contact tracing.
23:41:21 <strcat[m]> yxcvbnmlp: that's not true
23:41:25 <strcat[m]> and doesn't make sense
23:41:30 <strcat[m]> and wouldn't be a problem anyway
23:41:38 <strcat[m]> suggest finding better, reliable sources of information
23:41:51 <strcat[m]> Exposure Notification API is a Play Services feature
23:41:57 <strcat[m]> and requires the user to authorize the app to use it
23:42:28 <strcat[m]> an app could instead use Bluetooth + request Location permission and roll their own
23:43:32 <strcat[m]> it's an opt-in feature with the stock OS with Play Services
23:43:38 <strcat[m]> it exists and is used by apps already
23:43:40 <nscnt> userman23[m]: Every app could track you; whatever profile. Different users are used to minimize the communication *between* apps.
23:44:11 <strcat[m]> the purpose of profiles is that each one is fully isolated from the others
23:44:32 <strcat[m]> they have their own shared data (contacts, home directory, etc.) and apps can't communicate across profiles
23:44:44 <strcat[m]> the app sandbox is always the same app sandbox
23:45:03 <neonfuz2> the point is, the standard contact tracing thing being installed on people's phones is part of google play services, so no that will not be coming to AOSP and therefore graphene os.
23:45:20 <strcat[m]> regardless it's opt-in on the stock OS anyway
23:45:30 <strcat[m]> and apps could also just roll their own via Bluetooth + Location permission
23:45:55 <strcat[m]> the approach taken avoids apps having location / bluetooth scanning info (considered location info by android) themselves
23:45:55 <neonfuz2> "rolling their own" doesn't seem very useful when not everybody is using your own contract tracing
23:46:04 <userman23[m]> Thank you.
23:46:04 <userman23[m]> So in reading more about profiles though, it seems a pain to have to switch every time I want to use a different app... Also, it looks like it will slow down the phone and affect the performance.  How many user profiles do you all use/have? I would imagine there'd by double-digits.
23:46:17 <strcat[m]> neonfuz: I'm saying they could implement the standard protocol themselves
23:46:23 <strcat[m]> it is just not how it's being done
23:46:25 <neonfuz2> oh ya
23:46:26 <neonfuz2> I see
23:46:35 <neonfuz2> is there a foss implementation? or only google play
23:46:51 <strcat[m]> the initial PoC was open source but the actual protocol being used isn't
23:47:00 <neonfuz2> hmm
23:47:01 <strcat[m]> I doubt anyone is interested in making one
23:47:02 <neonfuz2> suspect
23:47:03 <strcat[m]> it's not useful anyway
23:47:27 <strcat[m]> Google and Apple only made it to stop governments from having a justification to FORCE them to make an invasive protocol
23:47:30 <strcat[m]> or rolling their own invasive protocol
23:47:31 <nscnt> userman23[m]: I use two. My main (admin) profile for daily stuff (with contacts, etc.) and another profile for exclusively two mainstream social media apps.
23:47:33 <strcat[m]> the whole thing
23:47:37 <strcat[m]> is not useful
23:47:42 <strcat[m]> it's not real contact tracing
23:48:30 <strcat[m]> just wear a mask, how does the app help you anyway? are you really going to isolate yourself for 14+ days because the app says you MIGHT have been exposed to COVID-19
23:48:32 <strcat[m]> what if it was a troll
23:48:38 <strcat[m]> doing a false report
23:48:50 <strcat[m]> wear a mask and don't worry about some useless
23:48:52 <strcat[m]> opt-in feature
23:48:54 <strcat[m]> on the stock OS
23:48:55 <JTL> That leads to my next question, how easy are false reports to file
23:48:58 <strcat[m]> and yes it is opt-in
23:49:00 <strcat[m]> requires explicit auth
23:49:29 <JTL> I recall reading during the design a contact had the "flagged" as infected by an "administrator" of the application in question
23:49:32 <JTL> iirc
23:51:00 <alzxjm[m]1> <strcat[m] "just wear a mask, how does the a"> It can be a useful first step leading to an in-person interview. Its not just about personal risk but risk to others. Yes, wear a mask, but it's helpful to be able to advise others you've seen that they are at risk.
23:51:47 <alzxjm[m]1> "Wear a mask because I might have been exposed to Covid" is much stronger than "wear a mask because it's the right thing to do."
23:51:53 <strcat[m]> alzxjm: nah app-based contact tracing is not useful
23:51:59 <strcat[m]> no everyone needs to wear a mask
23:52:02 <strcat[m]> unconditionally
23:52:29 <strcat[m]> the studies on the app-based contract tracing determined it MAY have some use with 80%+ of people using it
23:52:35 <neonfuz2> why is it unuseful? too many false positives?
23:52:37 <strcat[m]> which is not gonna happen
23:52:47 <strcat[m]> and also
23:52:56 <strcat[m]> the protocol they made is really bad at knowing if exposure happened
23:53:05 <strcat[m]> it doesn't know if both people had masks
23:53:09 <strcat[m]> it doesn't know if you were indoors
23:53:13 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really know how close you were
23:53:25 <strcat[m]> it uses a non-adjustable bluetooth frequency signal strength measure
23:53:29 <neonfuz2> I guess they're doing the best they can
23:53:37 <neonfuz2> or pessimistically using it as an opportunity to spy
23:53:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just don't go outside
23:53:46 <strcat[m]> redcat: that's not how it works
23:54:01 <neonfuz2> I read it was like, using the signal protocol or something and the security was decent when it was first being designed?
23:54:06 <strcat[m]> if both the person infected and the person not infected are wearing decent masks and not coming in close indoors proximity for a long time
23:54:12 <strcat[m]> and that's how things are overall
23:54:14 <strcat[m]> it gets wiped out
23:54:16 <neonfuz2> something like similar to find my iphone design, tbh idk much tho
23:54:25 <strcat[m]> countries that actually used masks
23:54:39 <strcat[m]> taiwan, hong kong, etc. where it was very emphasized
23:54:43 <strcat[m]> and everyone did it
23:54:48 <strcat[m]> it wasn't a severe problem at all
23:54:56 <strcat[m]> redcat: read about it? it's well documented
23:54:59 <nscnt> If you wear a mask, you mostly keep *others* safe. If I'm sick and not using a mask, spreading everything, you could get through your eyes too even if you have the best mask.
23:55:03 <strcat[m]> it doesn't submit location or proximity metadata to anyone
23:55:07 <strcat[m]> no one has that info centralized
23:55:09 <strcat[m]> not how it works
23:55:15 <strcat[m]> it's an exposure notification system
23:55:21 <nscnt> And because we don't know if we are infected, we all need to wear it.
23:55:25 <strcat[m]> nscnt: no you keep yourself safer too
23:55:31 <strcat[m]> and BOTH PEOPLE wearing a mask makes a huge difference
23:55:39 <strcat[m]> the infected and non-infected person
23:55:44 <strcat[m]> that's how probabilities work
23:55:55 <strcat[m]> nscnt: you're wrong about it
23:56:29 <strcat[m]> and really if everyone just wore masks when around other people it becomes a non-issue
23:56:38 <strcat[m]> places where that's the case have no severe coronavirus problem
23:57:56 <strcat[m]> contact tracing apps are not useful since everyone should be treating it as if they and others may be infected and then it gets wiped out as can be seen from looking at the facts
23:58:02 <strcat[m]> it is not a major inconvenience wearing a mask around others
23:58:11 <strcat[m]> places like taiwan haven't even needed to do a lockdown
23:58:32 <strcat[m]> because they aren't extremely selfish morons like western society
23:58:42 <strcat[m]> redcat: it is encrypted
23:58:45 <strcat[m]> again, read about it
23:58:46 <strcat[m]> it's well documented
23:58:49 <defconanon010102> Norway has suspended their contact tracing app due to privacy concerns.
23:59:23 <strcat[m]> the exposure notification system is privacy-preserving in terms of the data it obtains
23:59:36 <strcat[m]> it doesn't give any location/proximity info to anyone
23:59:43 <strcat[m]> until you push out a notification that you are infected
23:59:47 <strcat[m]> and then it decrypts your info
23:59:52 <strcat[m]> and allows others to see if they were in proximity
23:59:54 <strcat[m]> that's how it works
23:59:59 <strcat[m]> it's a neat protocol
