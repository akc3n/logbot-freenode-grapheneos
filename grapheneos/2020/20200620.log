00:00:55 <dq[m]> Finally installed Grapheneos on my Pixel 3 without any issue. ü§©
00:01:13 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr, welcome aboard the good ship, dq[m]!
00:02:25 <dq[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Yarr, welcome aboard the good sh"> Thanks, now its time to dig further with F-droid.
01:55:32 <qyo3462572445[m]> Yes, welcome aboard!
01:59:23 <qyo3462572445[m]> I'd love to get my wife on graphene but she's too into her iPhone and social media.  Yuck
02:13:55 <fluoridatedsheep> <qyo3462572445[m] "I'd love to get my wife on graph"> cant win them all
02:16:50 <cn3m[m]> Better iPhone than a regular Android at least
02:18:15 <cn3m[m]> I finally got all my family on iPhones (beside yours truly)
02:25:34 <qyo3462572445[m]> Yea I guess. Still not happy about it. I don't trust apple as far as I could throw them, but I trust the shady android makers less.
02:26:01 <qyo3462572445[m]> Plus, the walled garden isn't for me.
02:29:16 <cn3m[m]> iPhones are still a little ahead on GrapheneOS for security and privacy if you're not really security savvy. Thankfully Android 11 will help a lot catching up
02:31:27 <qyo3462572445[m]> Maybe. But I think it more depends on how you use it. If you enable icloud, and back absolutely everything up to Apple servers, that's not really private considering they have access to that. Unfortunately they push icloud like no tomorrow onto people.
02:33:03 <qyo3462572445[m]> Secure? Eh, maybe if you trust apple to handle that data properly. On device, I'd agree. But, most people I know with iphones love their icloud and use it for everything.
02:34:45 <defconanon12[m]> Is anyone else having a problem using Signal? Can't send anything.
02:35:45 <qyo3462572445[m]> No, signal is working fine for me.
02:44:57 <cn3m[m]> Yeah iPhones there are some settings you should change if you aren't comfortable with them having it
02:51:18 <garbage_keyboard> Hello, I just have a question which I am sure gets asked a lot but could not find the answer to. The question is: Will post-processing be different for the photos with grapheneos
02:55:28 <proof_jr[m]> <defconanon12[m] "Is anyone else having a problem "> try reboot phone

03:25:30 <defconanon12[m]> Okay with Signal using APKmirror how do I verify I am getting the right one? Talking about the beta types.
03:27:20 <defconanon12[m]> Other than using my computer with the Android dev apps. Let's say I am not by my computer. Any alternative?
03:27:29 <proof_jr[m]> download from signal website
03:27:33 <proof_jr[m]> has automatic updates
03:28:26 <defconanon12[m]> I did and it screwed up. Reinstalling it though either way. If anyone has an answer to the first question I would love to know.
03:28:37 <defconanon12[m]> Verifying any app.
03:33:09 <defconanon12[m]> Oh silly me. That was an user error on my fault.
03:37:25 <defconanon12[m]> Signal works by the way. Just had to switch off AM.
03:51:14 <interceptingfist> <dq[m] "Finally installed Grapheneos on "> I installed it on pixel 3 and I noticed the battery wasn't as good on 3a I'm not sure why but I switched back to 3a
03:52:16 <defconanon12[m]> interceptingfist: Depending on what you turn off. If you are really good get it 2 and a half or 3 days.
04:03:48 <dq[m]> when I boot my Pixel 3 it always says - Your device is loading a different operating system. Is that norma or any fix is available?
04:04:28 <dq[m]> This Pixel 3 is just installed Grapheneos.
04:04:43 <dq[m]> Any suggestion?
04:05:54 <defconanon12[m]> dq: It is normal.
04:07:49 <dq[m]> Thanks, I was confusing because I haven't installed blueline-ota_update-2020.06.02.02.zip yet. I just used the blueline-factory file. Why we need this ota_update and how we install it?
04:14:41 <joshman[m]> <dq[m] "Thanks, I was confusing because "> You need to stay up to date

08:51:04 <eligiblecoffee[m> I used the auditor app and got the yellow background when audited pixel 3xl with graphene os instead of the green background as posted on the appstore. What am I doing wrong?
08:56:44 <cx2[m]> <eligiblecoffee[m "I used the auditor app and got t"> Do it twice
08:57:21 <eligiblecoffee[m> I did it multiple times. Same result.
08:58:01 <eligiblecoffee[m> Should I reinstall graphene os?
08:58:54 <cx2[m]> That was my only advice on that one regarding attestation.
08:58:54 <cx2[m]> I had the same issue for local attestation, but only the first time two devices were used together. After than, it was green.
08:58:54 <cx2[m]> Though the results were the same
08:59:32 <eligiblecoffee[m> Okay. Maybe I should try with the other phone.
09:01:33 <cx2[m]> I‚Äôd read through the documentation as well.
09:01:33 <cx2[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial
09:02:46 <eligiblecoffee[m> The auditor phone wasn't supported. So can that be an issue?
09:03:35 <cx2[m]> Would stand to reason that would be an issue. Have you tried remote?
09:03:42 <eligiblecoffee[m> I mean its on android 9 and has camera.
09:04:01 <eligiblecoffee[m> No I haven't tried remote attestation yet.
09:07:23 <cx2[m]> Gotta run.... but you likely do NOT need to reinstall GrapheneOS.
09:07:24 <cx2[m]> I would also consider trying remote attestation.
09:08:04 <cx2[m]> <eligiblecoffee[m "I mean its on android 9 and has "> There are a list of supported devices on the link I provided.
09:08:42 <cx2[m]> Beginning with a supported device would also likely help
09:19:16 <eligiblecoffee[m> cx2: thank you
09:33:46 <stuux[m]> eligiblecoffee: I would try to clear all the pairings on both devices and would try it again. The yellow background is only when it is the first time two devices do the initial pairing. After that it should be green.
09:34:36 <stuux[m]> should also work fine if the auditor device is an "unsupported" devices if it was launched with android 8
09:34:51 <stuux[m]>  * should also work fine if the auditor device is an "unsupported" device if it was launched with android 8
09:52:18 <eligiblecoffee[m> stuux: okay. Will try as you mentioned. Thanks
10:24:55 <hapssmak[m]> Is Librem computers worth anything from a hardware security point of view?
10:24:55 <hapssmak[m]> Thought about one for running QubesOS

11:22:59 <hapssmak[m]> <madaidan[m] "> <@hapssmak:matrix.org> Is Libr"> Would you mind explaining why?
11:24:30 <madaidan[m]> <hapssmak[m] "Would you mind explaining why?"> They pretend their stuff is super secure when in reality, it's the opposite. It's a really dishonest company that spreads bullshit and misleads people into buying their overpriced crap. It's essentially a scam.
11:25:15 <madaidan[m]> The Librem laptops are no different than other standard laptops, just with extra security theater.
11:25:34 <madaidan[m]> PureBoot is a broken form of verified boot which doesn't cover the entire OS.
11:25:56 <madaidan[m]> The Librem 5 is a substantial degradation from other standard phones.
11:27:14 <EssentialChaos[m> <madaidan[m] "The Librem laptops are no differ"> It's actually worse, imo
11:27:32 <EssentialChaos[m> It's very overpriced for that hardware
11:27:33 <EssentialChaos[m> More so than Apple
11:27:38 <EssentialChaos[m> Especially when you consider the software too
11:29:50 <alzxjm[m]1> > PureBoot is a broken form of verified boot which doesn't cover the entire OS.
11:29:50 <alzxjm[m]1> madaidan. Could a user rectify this by running Skulls on a Librem 13/15?
11:30:25 <alzxjm[m]1> * Heads on a Librem 13/15
11:32:45 <madaidan[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "* Heads on a Librem 13/15"> They already uses heads and it doesn't rectify anything.
11:33:28 <madaidan[m]> Only verifying the bootloader, kernel, initramfs, etc. is pointless when I can just modify any other privileged part of the OS like init.
12:08:00 <dq[m]> <dallemon[m] "If you have installed the factor"> Thanks for further clearance.
15:23:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: they also don't have actual verified boot leading up to the firmware anyway
15:24:39 <strcat[m]> eligiblecoffee: read the Auditor tutorial - yellow is just a secondary way of showing that it's an initial pairing, it says so in the output too
15:24:56 <strcat[m]> when you do a verification after the initial pairing it says so in the output and uses a green background to represent that
15:52:06 <faxing[m]> Is the beta channel any less private or secure in any way?
16:14:33 <plsbrespectfulgu> <faxing[m] "Is the beta channel any less pri"> beta is subject to more testing and most likely, more frequent updates. id stick with stable if you arent into dev stuff

16:40:06 <prisonplanet[m]> Hi
16:40:31 <cn3m[m]> MacBooks, Chromebooks, and Windows Secured Core PCs aren't backdoored while Librem laptops are being shipped with known security vulnerabilities intentionally.
16:43:43 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "MacBooks, Chromebooks, and Windo"> Intentionally?

16:44:57 <prisonplanet[m]> I know there is a setting in "Network" - "Advanced" - "VPN": Permanent VPN - Block connections without VPN
16:44:57 <prisonplanet[m]> This setting prevents the whole system from connecting to the internet without a VPN, but I'm talking about preventing selected applications from accessing the internet without a VPN.

17:03:35 <furofuro_01[m]> But whatever it is, all I knew is using one profile with VPN should prevent leak?
17:22:56 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "Intentionally?"> Yes, they don't ship microcode and don't update it.
17:22:57 <cn3m[m]> They know it and don't care
17:23:03 <cn3m[m]> They say it's for "privacy" which is an incredibly stupid idea
17:28:14 <nickcalyx[m]> > MacBooks, Chromebooks, and Windows Secured Core PCs aren't backdoored while Librem laptops are being shipped with known security vulnerabilities intentionally.
17:28:14 <nickcalyx[m]> How can I verify that macbooks, Chromebooks and windows secured core aren't backdoored
17:33:39 <hypokeimenon[m]> Shouldn't there be an off topic room for GrapheneOS?
17:34:26 <hypokeimenon[m]> Obviously the topic of discussion is usually security but it's sometimes not even tangential to Graphene OS
17:35:14 <hypokeimenon[m]> That way the Graphene OS devs don't have to read non-pertinent stuff all the time

17:37:01 <alzxjm[m]1> > Shouldn't there be an off topic room for GrapheneOS?
17:37:01 <alzxjm[m]1> I think this is a great idea.
17:40:00 <alzxjm[m]1> Mostly because I find the off topic security/privacy stuff really valuable and I feel bad cluttering up the feed where people are trying to get GrapheneOS to work.
18:02:02 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: and how can you verify that anything else isn't
18:02:31 <nickcalyx[m]> You cant prove a negative
18:02:32 <strcat[m]> and a Librem laptop is not in any way open hardware, and even if it was I'm not sure how that would be relevant
18:02:57 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: I'm not sure what you're saying
18:04:28 <madaidan[m]> You can't verify that anything isn't backdoored
18:05:00 <nickcalyx[m]> For example, you cant prove unicorns don't exist
18:06:48 <madaidan[m]> The point isn't that everything is definitely backdoored but that it's always possible for anything to be backdoored.
18:06:55 <hypokeimenon[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "For example, you cant prove unic"> So you cannot prove that there are no backdoors, but you can prove that there is one?
18:08:54 <joshman[m]> I don't follow anymore. It's getting so confusing
18:09:54 <nickcalyx[m]> I was mainly asking how I can verify the claim that macbooks, Chromebooks and windows whatever enterprise version do not have backdoors
18:10:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> josh.man: The point nickcalyx was making is that making the software open-source lowers the barrier for discovering bugs, vulnerabilities and backdoors by extension.
18:10:48 <nickcalyx[m]> I wasn't talking about librem personally
18:10:49 <madaidan[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "I was mainly asking how I can ve"> You can't
18:11:42 <joshman[m]> Neither can you verify pixel's Qualcomm chip isn't backdoored?
18:11:57 <nickcalyx[m]> Right
18:12:15 <jalb66> MITM them?
18:12:23 <joshman[m]> Well. In that case I'm still following ü§£
18:12:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> josh.man: The point others are making is that  it isn't much of an argument on its own because open-source software can also be complex or large enough to be backdoored anyway.
18:13:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> And other parts of the stack are going to be closed anyway.
18:13:11 <strcat[m]> it doesn't have to be particularly large / complex
18:13:11 <joshman[m]> Bitcoin solves it?
18:13:24 <strcat[m]> what?
18:14:28 <joshman[m]> I mean large amount of folks are praising block chain tech to come and solve trust problem once and for all. Can this really be true
18:14:42 <strcat[m]> not sure how it's relevant
18:15:12 <hypokeimenon[m]> <strcat[m] "it doesn't have to be particular"> Or have a small development community / small number of eyes on it. Or have only malicious actors working on it. etc I've missed a lot of nuance

18:49:20 <cdesai> https://gitlab.com/calyxos/vendor_calyx/-/blob/android10/scripts/release.sh#L32 is what we do for usage with otatools.zip
18:49:41 <cdesai> and otatools.zip has bin/aapt
18:51:22 <dallemon[m]> aapt is also several places in the repo already if i do "find . -name aapt"
18:52:02 <cdesai> binary would be in out/host/linux-x86/bin
18:52:13 <cdesai> and if you have envsetup sourced that should be in $PATH
18:52:36 <strcat[m]> dallemon: the issue appears to be that it's not in your PATH because you're using a different shell than where you built or something like that
18:54:34 <dallemon[m]> yes, i think i closed that termnial after the build finished, just did "source script/envsetup.sh" before running release.sh

19:00:23 <dallemon[m]> strcat cdesai thanks, "source script/ensetup.sh" and "choosecombo release aosp_coral user" fixed it :)
19:02:36 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "I'd probably commit murder to ge"> Or you can just ask
19:03:17 <cn3m[m]> <madaidan[m] "Or you can just ask"> Madaidan can I have your security and privacy bookmarks? Please üòÑ
19:03:55 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "Madaidan can I have your securit"> Only if you commit murder first
19:04:17 <cn3m[m]> Got any targets in mind?
19:06:42 <madaidan[m]> yes
19:07:02 <cn3m[m]> <madaidan[m] "yes"> Say the word sar
19:07:40 <EssentialChaos[m> cn3m: He will give you one link from his bookmarks per each target
19:08:33 <cn3m[m]> I think this is going to make a great TV show
19:08:55 <EssentialChaos[m> Or a new Hitman game
19:09:26 * TheJollyRoger plays the "BWAAAAAN!" sound effect from Hitman.
19:10:06 <madaidan[m]> <cn3m[m] "I think this is going to make a "> "Madaidan's Bookmarks"
19:10:48 <jalb66> lol
19:10:56 <EssentialChaos[m> > "Madaidan's Bookmarks"
19:10:56 <EssentialChaos[m> National Treasure: Madaidan's Bookmarks
19:11:55 <jalb66> National Security matter
19:18:29 <radixed9[m]> I'd watch that
20:42:37 <interceptingfist> cn3m: are apps on graphene sandboxed like iOS apps?
20:44:37 <strcat[m]> apps are sandboxed
20:44:52 <strcat[m]> I recommend reading the FAQ and existing posts on these topics elsewhere
21:03:34 <interceptingfist> Thanks i didn't see it in the faq
21:22:39 <plsbrespectfulgu> <strcat[m] "apps are sandboxed"> would you say it renders shelter worthless?
21:28:31 <jalb66> What do you people use to send/receive files between GOS and your PC?
21:29:34 <EssentialChaos[m> jalb66: I don't have Graphene, but I assume KDE connect should work
21:29:40 <EssentialChaos[m>  * jalb66: I don't have Graphene, but I assume, KDE connect should work
21:29:57 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m: thx
21:30:44 <jalb66> Or maybe you know an encrypted link or service to do it
21:31:12 <jalb66> Kde I suppose it has a lot to install
21:31:44 <EssentialChaos[m> What is your OS (and DE)?
21:31:57 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m: linux xfce
21:32:10 <EssentialChaos[m> I use KDE Connect to send files once, but if I need to sync them I use Syncthing
21:32:23 <EssentialChaos[m> You can use Syncthing
21:32:37 <EssentialChaos[m> Just create a folder and dump files you need to send there
21:32:56 <jalb66> Does it open a port like ftp or sftp?, not dangerous?
21:33:14 <EssentialChaos[m> <jalb66 "EssentialChaos: linux xfce"> You can get KDE Connect to work on xfce, but yeah will have to download some Qt dependencies
21:33:14 <jalb66> I mean a server
21:33:30 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m: yes, i know
21:34:20 <EssentialChaos[m> Syncthing is p2p
21:34:20 <jalb66> In that case "primitive ftp" could work but I don't want a server in Gos
21:34:33 <jalb66> EssentialChaos[m: ah great
21:34:38 <jalb66> Thx
21:42:36 <nickcalyx[m]> Please consider donating a few bucks per month if you can, to support GrapheneOS's development and sustainability - https://github.com/sponsors/thestinger
21:48:52 <nickcalyx[m]> The donations are matched by github, so if you give $1 it becomes $2.   the fundraiser is only at 24% of its rather modest goal
22:34:52 <hapssmak[m]> How often does GrapheneOS change MAC address on Bluetooth?
22:41:41 <overheadscallop[> hapssmak: https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200603#c4044633
23:17:16 <nickcalyx[m]> good looking out, overheadscallop
23:49:10 <Qwexi[m]1> Is graphene close to offering support for the pixel 4 XL? Sorry if this question gets asked often. There was some conflicting information when I searched it.
23:49:46 <JTL> As I understand it, dev work is ongoing
23:53:14 <faxing[m]> <Qwexi[m]1 "Is graphene close to offering su"> From my understanding, while support is planned and in the pipeline, it will not be released - much less **usable** for a good while
23:53:34 <faxing[m]> So I wouldn't hold out too much hope for now
