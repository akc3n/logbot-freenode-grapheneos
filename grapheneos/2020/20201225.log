01:10:58 <Thatcher[m]> Santa asked me if there are any Google backdoors or other code that links to Google servers in AOSP and if all that stuff is removed in GrapheneOS? (Asking for Santa Claus)
01:13:27 <madaidan[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Santa asked me if there are any "> https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
01:22:34 <Thatcher[m]> Was actually asking for my brother. He wants more privacy from GAFAM, so I'm showing him Graphene
01:23:40 <strcat[m]> there are no "Google backdoors" in AOSP or the supported devices
01:25:37 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS provides a choice of using our connectivity server or the default one so it doesn't make connections to Google servers unless you choose to blend in with other Android devices
01:26:07 <strcat[m]> since we also use a secure HTTPS-based network time implementation rather than the standard NTP (which is insecure) servers
01:26:19 <strcat[m]> covered in the FAQ
01:28:28 <Thatcher[m]> Thank you strcat
01:28:30 <strcat[m]> Vanadium is also covered there, including that the WebView doesn't make any connections not done by the apps using it and the browser still uses some standard Chromium servers to fetch updates for things like dictionaries
01:29:02 <strcat[m]> all covered there
01:29:08 <strcat[m]> no connections are made by default that aren't covered
01:29:13 <strcat[m]> all other connections are triggered by apps
01:30:22 <strcat[m]> for example if an app says that it wants to handle opening URLs for a domain and asks the OS to check that it's permitted, the OS has to fetch the relevant information metadata from the domain to verify it - that's triggered by installing an app doing that and you can avoid it by not installing the app (all possible to see from the static apk metadata)
01:30:34 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations
01:30:43 <strcat[m]> we don't cover that kind of thing there because it's not a default connection made by the OS
01:31:03 <strcat[m]> we may add another section explaining that, and explaining that the OS has APIs like DownloadManager which apps that have the Network permission enabled can use
01:31:33 <strcat[m]> so it's a mistake to attribute those connections to the OS, it's making them on behalf of apps (same with DNS queries)
01:37:59 <Thatcher[m]> Thanks for clarifying all that. Your work is incredible!
01:50:58 <Thatcher[m]> Now the question is: to use Graphene server or Google for connectivity checks? I'd prefer to not stand out in a sea of iphones and androids, so I think using the Google server for connectivity checks will be better for my privacy. Other than that, the only time my phone will query Graphene servers is the update checks every 4 hours
01:54:07 <louipc> so its still standing out i guess
01:58:26 <mulbr[m]> Where's jolly rodger for this sea shanty standing
02:57:17 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: there's time.grapheneos.org too if network time updates are enabled (you can disable it)
02:58:02 <strcat[m]> Thatcher: you'll blend in with other Android devices with network time updates disabled, because AOSP / stock only use NTP when they aren't getting the time from the mobile network, while GrapheneOS doesn't trust either the mobile network or the insecure NTP protocol
02:58:17 <strcat[m]> so AOSP normally isn't using NTP because normally there's a mobile network
02:58:42 <strcat[m]> we only use the mobile network to get the time zone which doesn't impact security like the time, since it has no impact on certificate validation, etc.
02:58:53 <strcat[m]> time is security sensitive due to key validity times
02:59:00 <strcat[m]> certificates expire
02:59:21 <strcat[m]> an attacker able to set your time could set it back 1 month to use an expired key they compromised
02:59:30 <strcat[m]> so we use a secure time update system
03:08:08 <qubits> E2E grao
03:10:12 <qubits> I hope that there will be time when E2E grapheneOS admin manager  will be developed
03:35:56 <rny> what are you even talking about?
03:36:03 <rny> e2e admin manager? wtf is that
03:40:11 <louipc> maybe MDM
03:40:39 <qubits> mdm
03:41:55 <qubits> orginal for grapheneos only end to end encrypted
03:43:03 <louipc> yes encryption will be a requirement for that for sure
03:46:06 <rny> is this for remote management of a grapheneos device?
03:46:19 <rny> sounds like an enterprise feature to me
03:46:27 <rny> where is the enterprise $$$? ffs
03:47:08 <rny> this feature (i hope) will be at the bottom of the feature wishlist/roadmap (if one exists)
03:47:22 <qubits> it could be pay per device managment
03:47:24 <rny> **tethered** to the bottom
03:47:40 <louipc> which is the top feature?
03:48:21 <qubits> i assume soon there will be 10.000 devices , very easy to reach that
03:48:21 <rny> louipc: i'm thinking the list gets read from top to bottom
03:48:30 <louipc> yea
03:48:46 <rny> qubits: why'd devs that contribute their free time help enterprise screw over their users?
03:48:53 <qubits> 10.000 device for 2e. is 20.000e eacht month income
03:49:38 <qubits> but i would pay only for orignal grapheneOS mdm nothing else
03:50:31 <rny> qubits: sounds good, i doubt grapheneos will ever ship a MDM
03:50:36 <Liakde[m]> Doubt that'll be prioritized as feature, due to lack of devs, and needing some cleanup on UI of some bundled apps, like PDFviewer (the page scrolling is quite bad, for instance)
03:50:41 <rny> it'll probably be rebranded as something else and use grapheneos as upstream
03:52:10 <Liakde[m]> Probably
03:52:42 <qubits> i think it would be a good thing to get extra income for such important project and it is actually a good case that enterprise also use grapheneos. world will be more secure
04:00:59 <qubits> The more attention this project receives and income and at the same time remains independent is a good thing
04:31:21 <anon1000[m]> Lightsword:
05:08:16 <purist94> Hey all. Anyone know how to check device imei in fastboot?
05:40:52 <strcat> they left too early
05:41:04 <strcat> anyway the answer is you can show all the available variables with `fastboot getvar all`
05:42:47 <strcat> devices make the serialno available there
05:43:08 <ayaen_t[m]> strcat:  he is there in offtpic
05:43:10 <strcat> showing the IMEI would require talking to the cellular radio which is probably too complicated for the bootloader to do
05:43:23 <strcat> ayaen_t[m]: they left there too
05:43:31 <strcat> Matrix doesn't sync joins/parts properly

12:11:36 <userman23[m]> Good Morning
12:11:58 <eagle> good  morning
12:12:21 <userman23[m]> any thoughts on this: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.tobykurien.google_news/?  It looks like it "sandboxes" the application.
12:15:20 <ayaen_t[m]> userman23: it provides the web app version of the application which some of us would install directly on the device as an app
12:15:31 <dar_gomml[m]> <userman23[m] "any thoughts on this: https://f-"> seema depreciated, the recommend using "webapps" instead (on fdroid too)
12:15:47 <dar_gomml[m]> * seems depreciated, they recommend using "webapps" instead (on fdroid too)
12:15:58 <ayaen_t[m]> and why dont we take this to grapheneos offtopic ?
12:16:52 <userman23[m]> sure
12:17:33 <ayaen_t[m]> dar_gomml:  yes most importantly its not been in more than a year
12:18:27 <eagle> ayaen_t[m] can you teach me please on the off topic how to make webs
12:18:28 <ayaen_t[m]> * dar_gomml:  yes most importantly its not been updated in more than a year
12:20:04 <ayaen_t[m]> eagle:  dont understand you fully. anyways off to off topic.
12:23:38 <joehandcockandja> I tried to do the whole "using the owner profile to only manage my user profiles" but the SMS notifications were all fucky
12:24:34 <joehandcockandja> And I wasn't able to do quick reply from the notification itself
12:36:53 <strcat> joehandcockandja: you need to enable SMS/calls for another profile
12:39:14 <ayaen_t[m]> i thought hed done that. seems like he can see the notifications themselves....
12:46:52 <joehandcockandja> <strcat "joehandcockandjames: you need to"> Yeah I did, I get the notifications it just doesn't let me quick reply and see the message text in the notification area. When I changed to another SMS app in the profile , it made things all weird and I was sending messages from the new SMS app while the AOSP one was receiving texts
13:54:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Glassrom no longer owns 86.105.51.194

14:55:51 <Neocortex391> Hello
14:56:06 <Neocortex391> What are the exact commands to run the Signify verification commands?
14:56:42 <Neocortex391> This command signify -Cqp
14:56:44 <Neocortex391> doesnt work
14:56:50 <Neocortex391> -Cqp isnt working on my system
14:57:09 <Neocortex391> Running Trisquel 8 OS, based upon Debian/Ubuntu
14:58:45 <ayaen_t[m]> Neocortex391:  could you ahow what exactly you typed in the terminal?
14:58:59 <Neocortex391> As per the guide: signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip.sig && echo verified
14:59:04 <Neocortex391> With latest verison info
14:59:09 <Neocortex391> -Cqp isnt recognized
14:59:48 <ayaen_t[m]> nah the whole command would help a lot.
15:00:39 <Neocortex391> Yeah thats the command I ran
15:00:40 <Neocortex391> signify -Cqp factory.pub -x sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip.sig && echo verified
15:00:53 <Neocortex391> And it says '-Cqp' is unrecognized or unknown etc
15:01:03 <ayaen_t[m]> if its a debian based and uses apt and you installed signify-openbsd you should do ok
15:01:03 <Neocortex391> Ive since flashed GOS without verifiying the Signature
15:01:14 <Neocortex391> yeah it just doesnt recognize the command -Cqp
15:01:16 <ayaen_t[m]> signify-bsd
15:01:21 <Neocortex391> alright
15:01:29 <Neocortex391> Also, I already flashed Graphene onto my pixel
15:01:39 <Neocortex391> Without verifying the cryptograhpic signature
15:01:58 <ayaen_t[m]> debian has another package signify which is not even maintained
15:02:02 <Neocortex391> So, is there anyway I can verify my Graphene OS is legit, once its already installed onto my phone
15:02:04 <Neocortex391> ok
15:02:24 <ayaen_t[m]> Neocortex391:  you should do it again.
15:02:57 <ayaen_t[m]> my opinion .
15:03:58 <Neocortex391> Yeah
15:04:01 <ayaen_t[m]> a proper installation ensures that the image you flashed is a good one .
15:04:06 <Neocortex391> Can I use the Auditor app to verify?
15:04:10 <Neocortex391> post-installation
15:04:33 <Neocortex391> can you use Auditor to verify my Auditor app
15:04:39 <Neocortex391> We can share QR codes via image sharing sites etc
15:04:40 <ayaen_t[m]> otherwise there is not much point in signing the build ls or making sure the builds are reproducible...
15:04:58 <Neocortex391> Yeah, I basically only had HTTPS security
15:05:04 <ayaen_t[m]> right now my phone is not with me
15:05:14 <Neocortex391> And my download was interrupted for unknown reasons like 5 times while downloading graphene
15:05:22 <Neocortex391> Perhaps NSA Quantum Insert
15:05:33 <Neocortex391> Implanting covert malware onto my graphene image
15:05:40 <Neocortex391> Would an Auditor app verification
15:05:49 <Neocortex391> proove the legitimacy of my GOS installation sufficiently?
15:06:01 <Neocortex391> Or are there places that malware can hide where auditor wont detect any changes
15:06:08 <Neocortex391> like some encrypted partition
15:06:11 <ayaen_t[m]> but if you have another recent android device running stock os you should be abke to install auditor and do.it as instructed
15:06:30 <Neocortex391> Auditor can run on stock android
15:06:31 <Neocortex391> ?
15:06:38 <Neocortex391> And, how through is Auditor
15:06:40 <ayaen_t[m]> Neocortex391: yes .
15:06:48 <Neocortex391> Im sure there some encrypted partition where sneaky FBI malware can hide
15:06:54 <Neocortex391> for example.
15:07:39 <ayaen_t[m]> Neocortex391:  neither i nor you can do anything about it short of dumping the device itself
15:07:46 <refraction[m]> Neocortex391: Reading the Github Q&A page would be nice
15:07:48 <refraction[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Auditor/releases
15:08:01 <ayaen_t[m]> yes thank you refraction .
15:08:08 <ayaen_t[m]> a relief.
15:09:32 <ayaen_t[m]> we need to do something about all this quantum nsa backdoor thingy. im not saying its all false.
15:10:20 <Neocortex391> Its 100% real
15:10:29 <Neocortex391> Basically NSA impersonates a legit server
15:10:32 <Neocortex391> and implants malware
15:10:46 <ayaen_t[m]> but seriously if you had such doubts then the most sensible thing to do is to dump the device and not use another computer built by yourself
15:10:47 <Neocortex391> NSA servers located to be faster than the real servers
15:11:20 <ayaen_t[m]> ok if its going to be about nsa and back doors then it should be in the offtopic room.
15:11:23 <Neocortex391> Yes, but just trying to be as secure as possible
15:12:10 <ayaen_t[m]> * but seriously if you had such doubts then the most sensible thing to do is to dump the device and not use another computer not  built by yourself
15:14:24 <refraction[m]> Neocortex391: OK, just to get the easy thing out of the way, what OS are you using?
15:14:33 <Neocortex391> Trisquel 8
15:14:41 <Neocortex391> so Auditor says my device is unmodified
15:14:49 <Neocortex391> Unmodified official release
15:14:53 <Neocortex391> Security Level High
15:15:33 <hdksv7391[m]> Camera on Pixel4a not working.. Was able to take one photo and now just shows blackscreen on camera. Bug or am I dumb
15:16:16 <refraction[m]> <Neocortex391 "so Auditor says my device is unm"> Then it should be alright.
15:17:21 <Neocortex391> Camera works for me
15:17:58 <Neocortex391> I just used the Auditor app on Google Pixel4A everything worked and verified
15:18:03 <Neocortex391> Camera worked
15:18:23 <Neocortex391> Try restarting phone, checking, then looking at permissions
15:18:38 <Neocortex391> Try updating Graphene OS
15:18:44 <hdksv7391[m]> Okey will try
15:18:48 <refraction[m]> <hdksv7391[m] "Camera on Pixel4a not working.. "> I would say Delete Cache and Storage, and if everything didn't work then reflash
15:18:58 <refraction[m]> Try the reboot first though
15:21:26 <hdksv7391[m]> Oh yeah fixed. Thankss :)

15:27:05 <Neocortex391> O man
15:27:10 <Neocortex391> I saw this moment coming 15 years ago
15:27:20 <Neocortex391> I was going to be sitting here in the Graphene OS chat room
15:27:24 <Neocortex391> With Jolly Roger
15:27:27 <Neocortex391> I saw all this coming 15 years ago
15:27:49 <Neocortex391> "Donate to Graphene OS"! :)
15:29:05 <Neocortex391> Quick somebody say something cybersecurity related
15:29:31 <hdksv7391[m]> Encryption
15:29:33 <Neocortex391> "My Encrypted Graphene OS phone, is using a Wireguard Offshore VPN, and has encrypted calls and Texts with Signal"! :)
15:29:36 <Neocortex391> Thanks
15:29:55 <hdksv7391[m]> :D
15:29:55 <Neocortex391> Now we are Cyb3r
15:30:11 <Neocortex391> So Cyb3r in here I just put on my *Puts on anonymous mask*
15:30:30 <Neocortex391> I feel so good Im going to setup a Tor Relay today
15:30:44 <ash[m]1> Finally installed graphene, is there a way to change keyboard settings as well as primary accent color?
15:32:00 <ayaen_t[m]> ash:  just type keyboard into the search bar in settings app .
15:32:17 <ash[m]1> ye found keyboard settings
15:32:22 <ash[m]1> ty :)
15:32:36 <ash[m]1> now tryna figure out accent color
15:32:49 <ayaen_t[m]> as doe the change of accent i dont think we have it like android stock does
15:32:58 <ash[m]1> gotcha
15:33:03 <ayaen_t[m]> * as for the change of accent i dont think we have it like android stock does
15:33:07 <ash[m]1> is there a root tweak that can?
15:33:47 <Neocortex391> Is there a way to change Icon Themes
15:34:01 <ayaen_t[m]> ash: rooting breaks the security model as the most priviliged user is just exposed so no
15:34:02 <Neocortex391> For example I like the Signal Stregnth Bar to have individual Bars instead of 1 solid bar
15:34:19 <ayaen_t[m]> Neocortex391: i dont think so.
15:34:24 <ash[m]1> kk
15:34:28 <hdksv7391[m]> Not sugested thing to do I think cuz of security..ash
15:34:29 <Neocortex391> In stock Pixel OS I can change the theme
15:34:31 <ash[m]1> tysm :)
15:34:47 <ayaen_t[m]> Neocortex391: yes sure .
15:34:59 <Neocortex391> Is it possible to do with Graphene?
15:35:09 <Neocortex391> Just want to see like the 5 Signal Strength Bars
15:35:15 <Neocortex391> Instead of 1 solid signal icon
15:35:25 <Neocortex391> I like to seee the individual signal strength bars
15:35:35 <Neocortex391> Where 5/5 is max signal, for example
15:35:45 <Neocortex391> Current setting is just 1 solid flush of white
15:36:08 <ayaen_t[m]> grapheneos is focused on bringing production quality os focused on security and privacy .this takes alot of resources so we will wait for theming .
15:36:44 <ayaen_t[m]> or probably just forget about it. imo.
15:36:48 <Neocortex391> https://i.imgur.com/s1cFPt5.jpg
15:36:51 <Neocortex391> Something like this
15:36:52 <Neocortex391> ^
15:37:08 <hdksv7391[m]> No.Neocortex391
15:37:08 <Neocortex391> I knows its just cosmetic but It should also be easy to add
15:38:01 <Neocortex391> No, what
15:38:13 <hdksv7391[m]> Not possible atm
15:38:14 <Neocortex391> It should take like 1minute to add the theme .ico files
15:38:26 <Neocortex391> Its just an .ico file I think
15:38:34 <hdksv7391[m]> XD
15:38:49 <Neocortex391> What?
15:38:55 <Neocortex391> Do you have anything constructive to add?
15:39:01 <Neocortex391> Adding a theme ico should be easy
15:39:24 <hdksv7391[m]> The OS is focused on security and privacy.
15:39:44 <Neocortex391> Yes I know
15:40:26 <ayaen_t[m]> guys lets take this to gfapheneos off topic
15:40:33 <refraction[m]> You could very well install a launcher for customisation, though it is the onus of the user to determine whether it is an application they can trust.
15:40:48 <ayaen_t[m]> refraction: good one .
15:41:10 <refraction[m]> Though if it is as easy as you say, you can always download the GOS source code and add in the .ico yourself.
15:41:31 <hdksv7391[m]> refraction: True
16:48:47 <SilverSurfer666> Hi, i have read that using secondary profiles make sure that the first profile harddisk stays encrypted and use the second profile
16:49:36 <SilverSurfer666> But when i have 2 profiles it always loads the administrator profile, and from the adminiatrator i have 2 switch 2 my second profile?
16:51:23 <Liakde[m]> That's by design. Admin (user) profile is always running until you reboot. You can logout secondary users to flush encryption keys.
16:57:57 <nscnt> SilverSurfer666: You misunderstood. Liakde[m] explained the actual benefit why to use different user profiles
16:59:21 <SilverSurfer666> Daniel micay on twitter : using ansecondary user as your main profile is one of our recommendations for high risk users
16:59:46 <SilverSurfer666> That way you can still boot uo and use the device withoit decrypting your main profile
16:59:53 <SilverSurfer666> What did i misunderstood?
17:00:04 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, admin user should ideally be empty
17:00:22 <SilverSurfer666> Yeah but when i boot phone it always starts main profile first
17:00:33 <SilverSurfer666> When i unlock the mail i can swith to second?
17:00:38 <Liakde[m]> The secondary (non-admin) user will be your "main" or daily user, which is not decrypted after you unlock admin user
17:01:01 <nscnt> Do you have a link to the tweet?
17:01:33 <SilverSurfer666> https://mobile.twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1342314760465997824
17:01:50 <Liakde[m]> admin user is the only the one you unlock and decrypt after reboot
17:01:50 <Liakde[m]> https://nitter.net/GrapheneOS/status/1342314760465997824#m
17:02:00 <Liakde[m]> due to file-based encryption
17:02:24 <Liakde[m]> Also, see https://grapheneos.org/faq#encryption
17:02:29 <Liakde[m]> for details
17:02:29 <SilverSurfer666> Okey but if the admin profile is empty than its useless
17:02:39 <nscnt> SilverSurfer666: You misread. The premise is, that you use your second user profile as your main
17:02:47 <SilverSurfer666> Because i still have to enter and decrypt the second profile to use apps?
17:03:12 <Liakde[m]> That's exactly the point. The admin user is only used for making secondary users, and a secondary user profile will be your main or daily user
17:03:18 <SilverSurfer666> Yes thats what i m saying, i want to use second profile as main
17:03:19 <Liakde[m]> <SilverSurfer666 "Because i still have to enter an"> You can logout.
17:03:39 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, nothing is stopping you from doing so
17:03:42 <SilverSurfer666> But every tine i boot the phone it automaticcly starts the admin , not the second
17:03:52 <simpletech[m]> Is it possible to directly log into the secondary profile without unlocking the other one?
17:03:52 <Liakde[m]> That's the point
17:03:54 <nscnt> Yes, your "main" user profile is just a concept
17:03:57 <SilverSurfer666> So i have to enter admin, thats empty and than enter the second again
17:04:09 <nscnt> You can't automatically boot into your secondary profile
17:04:10 <Liakde[m]> Yeah
17:05:10 <nscnt> SilverSurfer666: It's not implied that you shouldn't use a lock method for your admin user, though
17:05:13 <SilverSurfer666> And if i log out from the second profile, and my apps like signal, whatsapp etc are there, i will not recieve messages till i log into the second again?
17:05:54 <Liakde[m]> <nscnt "SilverSurfer666: It's not implie"> It is recommended to have passwords on admin user profile and daily secondary user profile.
17:06:08 <Liakde[m]> <SilverSurfer666 "And if i log out from the second"> Yeah.
17:06:38 <SilverSurfer666> Hmm , it makes using my smartphone more complicated
17:07:18 <simpletech[m]> > for high risk users
17:07:49 <Liakde[m]> <SilverSurfer666 "Hmm , it makes using my smartpho"> Depends on your security practices, but it's a small price to pay for app isolation and storage isolation
17:08:35 <Liakde[m]> Take your own pace though
17:08:39 <SilverSurfer666> Thata true, gotta get used to it
17:08:44 <simpletech[m]> Hmm, propably. Maybe we will see a option in a future version of Android where we can directly log into a secondary account
17:09:13 <Liakde[m]> For security reasons, I don't think that's desirable
17:09:30 <SilverSurfer666> Switching from second to first is easy, but from main to second , gotta do it in option that sucks
17:10:17 <SilverSurfer666> So every time i switch from second to main, my second profile and alle the apps/data are encrypted again
17:10:31 <Liakde[m]> <SilverSurfer666 "So every time i switch from seco"> logout*
17:10:55 <Liakde[m]> switching will not flush the encryption keys from memory
17:10:58 <simpletech[m]> <Liakde[m] "logout*"> German auto-correction? :D
17:11:34 <SilverSurfer666> Didnt know you can switch and logout, tought it was the same
17:11:52 <Liakde[m]> Not really, the word switch is the one I am trying to correct. That can be found by holding the power off button, and it has this "End Session" option there
17:12:44 * Liakde[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20201225-171210.png (29KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/kde.org/5ec103e79e91932ca4a5f920a3adc2b3864c3d72/Screenshot_20201225-171210.png >
17:13:18 <SilverSurfer666> Okee ubderstood, thank you
17:13:43 <Liakde[m]> You're welcome
17:17:28 <dazinism> SilverSurfer666: theres a load of info about using profiles here. https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
17:58:50 <nscnt> He's already gone, but: There's a quick switching option for user profiles. If you fully "swipe down" the quick settings menu, you'll see a little icon on the bottom right to switch to another user
17:59:09 <nscnt> It lists all users there
19:09:33 <Thatcher[m]> I run Graphene admin account as my main. What are the security benefits of running a secondary account as main?
19:11:03 <simpletech[m]> {App, Storage} Isolation. You could install untrusted apps in one place and signal, threema and so on on your profile you're actively using
19:11:23 <hdksv7391[m]> Again broblems with my camera. It works but after a while it stops and have to reboot device to make it work again
19:19:35 <Thatcher[m]> <simpletech[m] "{App, Storage} Isolation. You co"> How does one differentiate untrusted and trusted apps? If apps are sandboxed in gOS, should it not matter to separate apps from each other via different profiles?
19:20:22 <sel[m]1> <Thatcher[m] "How does one differentiate untru"> I'm assuming trusted & untrusted is subjective here
19:20:37 <sel[m]1> Signal maybe trusted while WhatsApp maybe untrusted (as an example)
19:22:02 <chris42> <bearded1[m] "Do you have a write up...> I am using a docker and script to build my aosp for the Pixel 5. Not fully automatic though...
19:23:40 <simpletech[m]> Example: You "need" to use Snapchat (why ever). I wouldn't trust Snapchat (for course: subjective) running on the same profile where my pictures, legally downloaded music and Signal is sitting. If you give Snapchat Storage permission, they GOT the permission to snoop your photos. Don't like that.
19:24:16 <Thatcher[m]> <simpletech[m] "Example: You "need" to use Snapc"> Ahh I see
19:27:09 <Thatcher[m]> So if an untrusted app has storage permission even in an OS like Graphene, can it be assumed that the app is secretly rummaging through your files and sending the data through the network without your knowledge?
19:27:53 <hdksv7391[m]> Yes
19:29:58 <Thatcher[m]> That sucks. I hope that security is upgraded in next version of AOSP
19:31:45 <Thatcher[m]> Like temporary storage permissions, and permission to view only specified files
19:33:51 <brenneke[m]> <nscnt "He's already gone, but: There's "> Does the second user get properly logged out automatically when switching back to admin?
19:34:06 <nscnt> brenneke[m]: No, it doesn't
19:34:29 <nscnt> That's why GrapheneOS implemented "End session"
19:34:56 <simpletech[m]> temporary storage permissions are not useful. If I got your data for 1 minute, I've got it forever. Maybe we can shrink down the access-area for apps (I think I saw that already somewhere?? dunno) via SELinux. On Computer we got e.g. Flatpaks which use this
19:38:02 <nscnt> Thatcher[m]: API level 30 has Scroped storage enforcement already
19:42:47 <nscnt> For a read: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage
19:55:14 <joehandcockandja> Any reason why I can't do quick reply to texts in a profile that isn't the owner?
19:55:22 <joehandcockandja> Is that just me or
19:56:00 <brenneke[m]> <nscnt "That's why GrapheneOS implemente"> Nice thanks...always wondered how to log out, read here it is accessed from power button menu.
19:56:07 <joehandcockandja>  Or see the message of the text in the notification area
19:56:31 <joehandcockandja> It only lets me in the owner profile
19:56:39 <simpletech[m]> <brenneke[m] "Nice thanks...always wondered ho"> You've got a "profile" tab in your menu if you swipe down
19:57:12 <nscnt> brenneke[m]: It's also available on the lockscreen
19:57:38 <nscnt> So you don't need to unlock before actually ending the session
19:59:52 <nscnt> Ah nvm you can also bring that up when locked
20:00:13 <nscnt> but, yea... There's a button on the lockscreen without the need of holding the power button
20:07:35 <joehandcockandja> Someone Please Help Has Anyone Else Experienced This Or Have An Solution :( I Am Dumb!
20:09:12 <nscnt> I don't know, sorry
20:13:21 <joehandcockandja> Pain.
20:19:34 <Thatcher[m]> Sounds like secondary profile is a pain in the ass
20:22:06 <nscnt> Sounds like users having a wrong impression of what it is and what it does
20:23:00 <joehandcockandja> I-i just needed help with the notification, chill out guys
20:23:17 <nscnt> I wasn't referring to you
20:24:18 <Thatcher[m]> He was referring to me
20:29:20 <Thatcher[m]> * Sounds like secondary profile is a pain in the ass (for people like me who have the wrong impression about what it is and what it does).
20:34:35 <joehandcockandja> Should I file a bug report :D
20:35:36 <Thatcher[m]> So if I had to guess, the main feature of the secondary profile is not the isolation of untrusted apps, but like having two phones in one. Like if I needed two Signal instances using different numbers with access to a completely different set of files. Compartmentalization, like Qubes.

20:38:36 <joehandcockandja> Yeah but, the notifications
20:38:54 <joehandcockandja> That's kind of my whole thing
20:41:23 <r00st3r[m]> Noob here, can someone explain to me how to make sure i buy a pixel with an unlockable bootloader on Verizon?
20:41:51 <Thatcher[m]> <r00st3r[m] "Noob here, can someone explain t"> Don't buy a Pixel from Verizon
20:41:56 <Thatcher[m]> Or any carrier for that matter
20:42:43 <r00st3r[m]> Next dumb question: is an "unlocked" phone different than one with an unlocked bootloader?
20:43:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> joehandcockandjames: what happened
20:45:16 <Thatcher[m]> <r00st3r[m] "Next dumb question: is an "unloc"> Not a dumb question. Yes, unlocked means you can use it with any carrier you choose. Unlockable bootloader means the system can be modified (to install Graphene)
20:47:04 <r00st3r[m]> where do you guys buy your phones from?
20:47:17 <Thatcher[m]> But I've heard that not all carriers are supported for Graphene, but I could be wrong. I've heard verizon users had some trouble. (I'm also kind of a noob to all of this)
20:47:41 <Thatcher[m]> I bought my unlocked Pixel 4a from Best Buy
20:48:07 <hdksv7391[m]> r00st3r:  It doesnt matter, you can ask frim the seller is it unlocked or locked
20:48:13 <hdksv7391[m]> From*
20:48:15 <louipc> or google, but i guess not many countries can buy from google
20:49:02 <r00st3r[m]> Thanks guys. Didn't mean to derail the rest of discussion but it's been driving me a little crazy
20:49:45 <hdksv7391[m]> I know the feeling, it took 7h of troubleshootting when installing Graphene xDr00st3r
20:49:53 <joehandcockandja> <anupritaisno1[m] "joehandcockandjames: what happen"> The notifications from texts on a profile that is not the owner do not have the ability to quick reply to or view the text of the message in the notification area
20:50:09 <joehandcockandja> I don't know whether this is intentional or not
20:50:15 <joehandcockandja> But I haven't found a way to make it possible
21:12:33 <hdksv7391[m]> Is the "Check For Updates" button suppose to do something in the device settings if automatic updates are enabled? Clicking it doesnt do anything so just thinking
21:19:03 <joehandcockandja> It's supposed to give you android 12
21:22:09 <hdksv7391[m]> :D

21:36:23 <hdksv7391[m]> nscnt: Thanks :)
21:40:04 <Cruft> Does Android or GrapheneOS have a way of using GPS as the NTP timesource?
21:40:19 * rafff[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/EtezlSRsSowwdysQMigiSvFJ/message.txt >
21:41:57 <Cruft> Default camera app isn't bad. Simple Gallery is better than Gallery. Material File Manager is better than default.
21:44:32 <nscnt> SilverSurfer666: If you swipe down to show the Quick settings, there is an icon for Users & guests at the bottom right. You don't need to tap through all settings
21:45:46 <rafff[m]> <Cruft "Default camera app isn't bad. Si"> I use simple gallery. Like it.
21:47:08 <Cruft> Gallery had a weird bug awhile back that sometimes comes back where when used with the default camera, deletes a picture after edit is used after clicking the picture in the circle.
21:47:09 <SilverSurfer666> Ok didnt know that thanks nscnt
21:47:19 <Cruft> So I just don't trust that interaction ever again
21:49:14 <strcat[m]> Cruft: GrapheneOS uses secure network time via HTTPS
21:49:17 <strcat[m]> GPS is not secure
21:49:33 <strcat[m]> Android normally uses the mobile network when available, otherwise NTP, neither of which is secure
21:49:50 <strcat[m]> NTP is an inherently insecure protocol
21:52:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> drifts in china gps
21:58:08 <eglssm[m]> <strcat[m] "GPS is not secure"> Why is not secure? I am not arguing that it is, it just got my attention that you say it is not. I would not have expected it. I have tried to find some meaningful info about but I did not succeed. If anyone can elaborate or drop a link where it is explained I would appreciate it. Thanks.
22:01:06 <strcat[m]> it's not meaningfully authenticated and can be spoofed
22:01:20 <SilverSurfer666> https://www.wired.com/story/spoof-jam-destroy-why-we-need-a-backup-for-gps/
22:02:03 <strcat[m]> Cruft: doesn't have cryptographically secure authentication - simple
22:02:19 <Golli[m]> You can broadcast your own GPS signal if you want.
22:02:20 <Golli[m]> The only thing that's stopping you is a law.
22:06:31 <Cruft> I mean, you wouldn't constantly be using it...
22:06:49 <Cruft> drift? what, after two months or more? come on.
22:06:52 <lodtank> does anybody  here have experience with kobo books app on graphene? does it work  on graphene?
22:07:15 <Cruft> How do you think the DNS providers are telling what time it is? WWVB? LOL
22:08:49 <Cruft> "GPS is not secure" says people constantly sending packets to tell what time it is from a source that uses GPS.

22:12:19 <tdrfygh> Hello everyone, do you know how long is the flashing process in fastboot ?
22:13:29 <Cruft> eglssm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack#GPS_spoofing
22:14:08 <SilverSurfer666> +- 5 minutes
22:15:24 <hdksv7391[m]> tdrfygh:  Falshing took 3h for me because had to do some troubleshootting
22:15:56 <SilverSurfer666> It took me 5 minutes
22:16:11 <hdksv7391[m]> Nice
22:16:48 <SilverSurfer666> First time i did it, it took me 4 hours and a broken windows laptop
22:17:11 <SilverSurfer666> Swiched to macbook amd now the process is smooth as a .....
22:18:01 <hdksv7391[m]> Oh well I was on Linux
22:18:18 <tdrfygh> thanks, it's been 30+ minutes and the phone did not reboot once si I guess I messed someting up
22:18:27 <Cruft> If we can't use GPS for time, why is there no switch to turn off downloading of the qualcomm GPS assistance files entirely? https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/139033/Android-Qualcomm-GPS-GNSS-Man-In-The-Middle.html
22:19:40 <SilverSurfer666> It will now reboot, it will just return to fastboot mode, where you can lock the bootloader again and manually start to see if the install process was right
22:19:57 <SilverSurfer666> Now=NOT sorry
22:20:43 <hdksv7391[m]> Cruft:  Why are you talking about this here in the GrapheneOS matrix channel.. XD
22:20:44 <tdrfygh> i'm on linux and fastboot didn't output anything, do you thing it safe to reboot the phone and start the whole sequence again ?
22:21:28 <tdrfygh> in the flash-all.sh there is a fastboot reboot-bootloader, i assumed it would reboot
22:21:30 <SilverSurfer666> Hmm not sure, never did it on linux
22:21:41 <Cruft> I asked if is was possible within android/grapheneos and was met with loads of FUD and the same issue, just abstracted.
22:21:55 <SilverSurfer666> I use adb reboot bootloader
22:23:31 <hdksv7391[m]> tdrfygh:  do adb reboot bootloader. If doesnt work search online for some help
22:23:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> tdrfygh: pm
22:24:14 <SilverSurfer666> Try youtube, there are some video s explaining step by step
22:24:36 <hdksv7391[m]> Techlore has great tutorials and troubleshootting guide
22:24:41 <tdrfygh> thanks, il will look at it
22:25:01 <LinusSexTips[m]> Techlores video messed a lot of people up though
22:25:37 <hdksv7391[m]> Really? It worked for me.. Okey after 7h xD
22:26:02 <tdrfygh> I got an error with adb reboot : error: no devices/emulators foundI will search about it
22:26:13 <LinusSexTips[m]> The first time I flashed I just followed the instructions on Ubuntu and finished after about 20 minutes
22:26:19 <LinusSexTips[m]> I had more problems on windows
22:26:28 <SilverSurfer666> Did you unlock oem and usb debughing?
22:26:42 <LinusSexTips[m]> * The first time I flashed I just followed the official instructions on Ubuntu and finished after about 20 minutes
22:26:48 <SilverSurfer666> Try adb devices and see if the device can be read
22:28:31 <tdrfygh> yes I did unlock oem and usb debugging, and unlock bootloader
22:28:43 <tdrfygh> no edvices are displayed
22:30:54 <tdrfygh> is it safe to reboot the phone and do it all again ?
22:31:48 <SilverSurfer666> Probably
22:31:59 <SilverSurfer666> I would reboot amd try again
22:32:33 <SilverSurfer666> You will probably have to enable usb debugging again
22:32:43 <SilverSurfer666> Before starting the process again
22:36:12 <tdrfygh> will do,
22:37:39 <tdrfygh> restarted without any trouble on andriod, I will troubleshoot the adb probelm, thanks for your help
22:37:56 <SilverSurfer666> Good luck
22:38:15 <SilverSurfer666> I would recommand watching a youtibe video while doing it again,
22:40:49 <gaussvector[m]> Anybody know if you can use firebase with graphene, or is it play dependant?
23:02:36 <SilverSurfer666> Anyone knows if pixel 5 will be supported anytime soon?
23:19:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> We need pixel 3 testers for carrierconfig changes
23:27:26 <tdrfygh> I retried and it flashed fine, after locking the bootloader I try to boot and I got an error "no valid slot to boot". I can't see anything relevant about it online
23:31:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Pm me
23:31:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> tdrfygh: told you to pm me
