00:00:00 <TheJollyRoger> "Hang on a moment guys, this installer comes on eight DVDs!"
00:00:00 <strcat[m]> requires a lot of manual intervention
00:00:05 <strcat[m]> best to just start over each new release
00:00:26 <cdesai> oh btw, https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#Why-is-my-build-slow had some interesting variables / tools
00:00:28 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: the slackware design is basically meant for a time before internet access
00:00:33 <strcat[m]> at least fast internet, lol
00:00:35 <TheJollyRoger> Oh good gravy.
00:00:43 <strcat[m]> i.e. must ship everything and assume no updates
00:00:59 <strcat[m]> they have some kind of philosophical disagreement with dependency management
00:01:01 <TheJollyRoger> I wonder if that's how its security model works too.
00:01:35 <strcat[m]> if applications are contained/sandboxed and bundle their own deps
00:01:40 <strcat[m]> that's different
00:01:41 <TheJollyRoger> <sarcasm>"Can't hack it if it's not online loooooool now let's just plug our ears and forget about the bajillion different USB drives our user just plugged in."</sarcasm>
00:01:41 <strcat[m]> but that's not how it is
00:01:58 <cdesai> also somewhat relevant - https://lwn.net/Articles/818860/
00:02:50 <strcat[m]> cdesai: if you look at aosp master you'll notice they added more prebuilts like m4
00:03:06 <TheJollyRoger> I used to think I got "marooned" on Gentoo island and ended up becoming stuck here unable to find a way off and doomed to scratch out a miserable existence fighting with this system. Now I'm thinking maybe I just might have noplace to swim to.
00:03:39 <strcat[m]> they also moved to python3 finally
00:03:42 <strcat[m]> so that will be there for Android 11
00:04:02 <cdesai> strcat[m]: yeah, I noticed that they add more darwin prebuilts too. I submitted a patch to be able to use zfs compression on my $OUT
00:04:34 <strcat[m]> I like that Arch is a rolling release (latest stable releases of upstream software) and has a policy against unnecessary downstream patching / customizations so it ships the software as upstream intends
00:04:53 <strcat[m]> but it's still the standard approach to a distribution without a well defined base system
00:05:07 <strcat[m]> and not a fan of glibc, GCC, binutils, systemd, etc.
00:05:19 * TheJollyRoger buries his face in his hands.
00:05:22 <strcat[m]> it's the least bad way of consuming this awful setup tho
00:08:26 <strcat[m]> almost done the build in this container
00:09:08 <strcat[m]> it will be nice when the kernel build uses the pure LLVM toolchain
00:09:21 <strcat[m]> atm we're still using GCC as HOSTCC/HOSTCXX which I could probably change right now
00:09:32 <strcat[m]> but binutils is still used too for host and for the target
00:09:43 <strcat[m]> https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/kbuild/llvm.html
00:09:54 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/jVZnPekQQmTQGzfSDfZtVTJs >
00:09:58 <strcat[m]> will be nice when that's just the norm
00:10:08 <strcat[m]> I'll see how far I can get it atm
00:10:21 <strcat[m]> don't want to build target stuff with different tools than they do though
00:13:17 <strcat[m]> interesting fact: the *BSDs consider GPLv3 to be a non-free license and GPLv2 less than totally free
00:13:50 <TheJollyRoger> This... this didn't have anything to do with Theo De Raadt saying something about "If they take our code, they wrap it with GPL code, and then we can't get it back...?"
00:14:08 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: GPLv2 and GPLv3 place restrictions on the use of the software
00:14:14 <strcat[m]> especially GPLv3
00:14:28 <TheJollyRoger> Oh. Oh yeah...
00:14:35 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: as one funny example, GPLv2 licensed software forbids using it with GPLv3 licensed software
00:14:55 <strcat[m]> it only works if people licensed it as "GPLv2 or later" which trusts the FSF with the ability to change their licensing terms
00:15:05 <strcat[m]> so for example the Linux kernel is GPLv2 only
00:15:21 <strcat[m]> this means you cannot take Linux kernel code and include it in glibc, that's a violation of the GPLv2
00:15:30 <strcat[m]> you cannot even reference it / read it or you're contaminating your work
00:15:54 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: that's pretty much the definition of non-free licenses - forbidding you from using it due to restrictions
00:16:02 <strcat[m]> similarly GPLv3 forbids having a locked down device
00:16:24 <TheJollyRoger> Sheesh >_<.
00:16:49 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS cannot include GPLv3 code or then it cannot be used on a device not supporting unlocking the bootloader, and we want to support that
00:16:50 <strcat[m]> so it isn't okay to include any GPLv3 licensed project in GrapheneOS
00:16:51 <strcat[m]> which rules out bundling many apps even aside from how we don't want to bundle a lot of apps
00:17:02 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow.
00:17:09 <strcat[m]> so aside from all the issues I have with F-Droid, we are forbidden by their license from bundling it
00:17:15 <TheJollyRoger> That's crazy, I didn't realize it was THAT intrusive!
00:17:20 <TheJollyRoger> Then again... I uh...
00:17:22 * TheJollyRoger redfaces.
00:17:27 <TheJollyRoger> I didn't read the license either... >_<.
00:17:45 <strcat[m]> Copperhead is violating the GPLv2 licensing for my kernel code
00:17:54 <strcat[m]> not just the old CC non-commercial licensing that I used
00:18:04 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
00:18:07 <strcat[m]> nice it built
00:21:23 <strcat[m]> btw  a quote of the GPLv2
00:21:24 <strcat[m]> > Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License
00:21:30 <strcat[m]> this bit was removed in the GPLv3
00:21:43 <strcat[m]> this means that a GPLv2 violator like Copperhead permanently loses any rights to use the code in the future - forever
00:22:01 <kieni111[m]> Thank you dazinism & TheJollyRoger !
00:22:04 <strcat[m]> too late now, they never have a right to use that code again
00:22:24 <TheJollyRoger> Hohohohoho
00:22:39 <strcat[m]> so the GPLv2 is pretty strict since it voids the rights it grants you FOREVER for violating it ever
00:22:50 <strcat[m]> they made the GPLv3 substantially less strict in this regard
00:23:09 <strcat[m]> and the FSF tried to scare people into moving to GPLv3 due to this
00:23:25 <strcat[m]> by saying that their own license (GPLv2) is draconian
00:23:27 <TheJollyRoger> kieni111[m]: yarr, hope it fixes yer problem, shipmate!
00:23:29 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
00:23:37 <TheJollyRoger> Now even the FSF can't even make up their minds, eh? O_O
00:23:40 <JTL> I like the idea of the GPL licenses, but I can't support the FSF
00:23:41 <strcat[m]> https://www.fsf.org/news/android-termination-upgrade-gplv3
00:24:14 <strcat[m]> so for example NVIDIA is a GPLv2 violator therefore the company has FOREVER lost the rights to use the Linux kernel at all, ever, for any reason
00:24:42 <strcat[m]> anyone who contributes code to it can sue them based on past / current GPL violations and they would need explicit permission from all the authors to ever use it again
00:24:56 <strcat[m]> of course no one really tries to enforce these copyrights to extent of the law in practice
00:25:03 <strcat[m]> but THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS and it is enforceable
00:25:24 <strcat[m]> I have code in the upstream kernel
00:25:39 <strcat[m]> but not enough to sue any of these companies for anything substantial
00:26:21 <strcat[m]> cdesai: look in prebuilts/build-tools/linux-x86/bin in AOSP master vs. AOSP 10
00:26:23 <strcat[m]> as an example
00:53:01 <strcat[m]> read https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/clang/host/linux-x86/+/master/GCC_4_9_DEPRECATION.md for some amusement btw
00:53:05 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: ^
00:54:03 <JTL>     Move GCC binary name.
00:54:04 <JTL>     Total 10s sleep.
00:54:06 <JTL> Ahahaha
00:56:19 <strcat[m]> I think the only use for us is some remaining bits of the Pixel 2 / 2 XL kernel
00:56:26 <strcat[m]> unsure what exactly it gets used for
00:56:42 <strcat[m]> but it prints a few warnings even though the kernel code is built with clang
00:57:04 <strcat[m]> not too concerned, Pixel 2 / 2 XL will be gone next year
00:57:15 <strcat[m]> and so will that legacy GCC toolchain soon...
00:57:24 <strcat[m]> I guess it has to get fixed for Android R for Pixel 2 / 2 XL
00:58:17 <strcat[m]> it seems to happen for linking some built-in.o files
01:02:29 <strcat[m]> maybe it's used for the vdso
01:02:30 <strcat[m]> hmm
01:05:29 <strcat[m]> cdesai: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_crosshatch/blob/10/build.sh
01:05:32 <strcat[m]> improved this a bit btw
01:10:18 <strcat[m]> ohhh I see
01:13:26 <strcat[m]> ok nice narrowing down where it's still using gcc
01:13:33 <strcat[m]> it's using it with gcc -E
01:14:18 <strcat[m]> I think it's just scripts/gcc-version.sh lol
01:14:19 <strcat[m]> hmm
01:14:33 <strcat[m]> or scripts/checksyscalls.sh
01:15:18 <strcat[m]> yup it's gcc-version.sh
01:24:15 <strcat[m]> ok fixed that
01:24:30 <strcat[m]> backported a commit from Android 11 kernel for both
01:24:39 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/kernel_google_crosshatch/commit/a23f3a75e20fcb656bb77f3a894aab828218b45a
01:24:43 <strcat[m]> some weird leftover cruft
01:32:25 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/commit/dadc7238b414da4b5eae50b5fa187b96d5d53801
01:32:28 <strcat[m]> well some minor progress
01:34:45 <strcat[m]> https://git.yzena.com/gavin/bc is used to provide bc by AOSP master
01:35:03 <strcat[m]>  /home/strcat/android/aosp/prebuilts/build-tools/path/linux-x86/bc
01:35:11 <strcat[m]> lrwxrwxrwx 1 strcat strcat 34 Apr 23 15:21 /home/strcat/android/aosp/prebuilts/build-tools/path/linux-x86/bc -> ../../linux-x86/bin/gavinhoward-bc
01:35:16 <strcat[m]> so can mark that one as fixed too
01:35:54 <strcat[m]> cdesai: ahhh we're supposed to use path in addition to bin
01:36:31 <strcat[m]> https://paste.xinu.at/MuMT/
01:36:36 <strcat[m]> cdesai: this provides bc and a bunch of other tools
01:37:54 <strcat[m]> just need to make the kernel build use this too
01:38:23 <strcat[m]> and maybe if everything is provided we can unset the existing PATH
01:41:25 <strcat[m]> avoids needing bc, which, diffutils, etc. and avoids the dependency on the host for most of the *nix utilities
01:41:58 <strcat[m]> wonder if we should use the sandbox for the kernel build if that's possible
01:43:48 <strcat[m]> bc is still needed for now
01:45:08 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#build-dependencies
01:45:13 <strcat[m]> ok so there are 3 linux kernel build deps for now
01:45:33 <strcat[m]> avoiding libgcc requires using compiler-rt for the stuff clang builds for use on the host as part of the kernel build
01:46:16 <strcat[m]> avoiding binutils requires using the LLVM toolchain for stuff other than compilation too, which is coming and largely implemented for userspace already (AOSP and the NDK use ld.lld instead of ld.bfd or ld.gold)
01:51:20 <strcat[m]> and notice they used toybox for most of it, gavinhoward-bc, one-true-awk
01:51:30 <strcat[m]> nice to get lighter, more robust versions of tools as part of this
01:51:41 * TheJollyRoger reads.
01:52:29 <TheJollyRoger> "move gcc binary to new file name?" Wait so what are they doing, like "ln -s gcc" or something...?
01:52:41 <TheJollyRoger> Ay carumba >_<.
01:52:55 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it's a good thing
01:53:23 <strcat[m]> they replaced all the variants of GCC with scripts that call the real gcc and warn in Android 10 and in Android 11 it's removed - no more GCC
01:53:29 <strcat[m]> will be happy to see binutils go too
01:53:41 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: I hadn't realized that they're also avoiding using GNU coreutils, GNU awk, etc.
01:53:47 <strcat[m]> that's what I just noticed
01:53:52 <strcat[m]> and implemented it in our kernel build script
01:54:23 <TheJollyRoger> OH
01:54:26 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: as part of doing reproducible builds, AOSP is using a build sandbox and shipping prebuilt versions of all the needed tools/libraries to build
01:54:32 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow.
01:54:45 <strcat[m]> but as part of doing that, this is also a move to BSD/MIT licensed tools and away from having tons of bloat/cruft in them
01:54:53 <TheJollyRoger> Wow!
01:55:32 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger:  https://paste.xinu.at/1gWc/ what I was showing here is what's provided by the build-tools prebuilts in AOSP master
01:55:37 <strcat[m]> it's a bit more than in Android 10
01:55:57 <strcat[m]> https://paste.xinu.at/psbX6o/
01:56:01 <strcat[m]> this is for Android 10 (GrapheneOS)
01:56:42 * TheJollyRoger reads both....
01:57:09 <strcat[m]> hopefully in Android 11 this process is complete and there are no longer host build dependencies other than the kernel
01:57:15 <strcat[m]> because it makes things easier and more reproducible / reliable
01:57:33 <strcat[m]> to have specific versions of all the tools that are used with a way to rebuild those
01:57:57 <strcat[m]> rather than relying on getting stuff from the host - arbitrary versions, different projects providing them (varies per distribution since multiple packages can provide many tools)
01:57:58 <TheJollyRoger> Wow. All self-contained and everything, so we won't have the same issues with a scattered, messy build system...?
01:58:31 <strcat[m]> so for example a tool like cp could be busybox, toybox, GNU coreutils, plan9port, *BSD tools or who knows what else
01:58:38 <strcat[m]> all slightly different
01:58:46 <strcat[m]> these things can impact reproducible builds
01:59:07 <strcat[m]> they're using modern, permissively licensed versions of the tools like toybox
01:59:21 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://github.com/landley/toybox
01:59:23 <strcat[m]> this is what Android uses itself too
01:59:33 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
02:00:09 <strcat[m]> http://landley.net/toybox/
02:00:20 <strcat[m]> part of the motivation behind toybox is being able to build Android on Android BTW
02:01:08 <JTL> Does the toolchain to build AOSP on ARM64 already exist?
02:01:18 <JTL> Or is that a future goal?
02:02:16 <strcat[m]> JTL: future but moving to LLVM etc. is a huge help
02:02:28 <strcat[m]> JTL: cross-compilation with LLVM and moving to a different host to build is so much easier
02:02:40 <strcat[m]> with GCC you're tied to using a specific toolchain to build on a specific host for a specific target
02:03:09 <TheJollyRoger> I didn't realize this part earlier O_O
02:03:22 <strcat[m]> so for example there's a linux-x86 build of aarch64-linux-android-g++, aarch64-linux-android-ar, aarch64-linux-android-as and so on
02:03:36 <strcat[m]> all the binutils and gcc stuff is per-target tools
02:03:46 <strcat[m]> they even have SEPARATE toolchains for different kinds of ARMv7
02:04:18 <strcat[m]> and there is ld.bfd and ld.gold, both incomplete
02:04:23 <strcat[m]> as part of binutils
02:04:33 <strcat[m]> you need ld.gold for some things, ld.bfd for others, both are super problematic
02:04:42 <strcat[m]> ld.gold is unmaintained since it's the 'Google linker' and they moved on to LLD
02:04:59 <strcat[m]> ld.bfd is super slow, badly supports LTO / plugins, and is written as this horrifying meta shell script thing
02:05:26 <strcat[m]> ld.bfd sources are this massive shell script system that generates code
02:05:28 <strcat[m]> it's really fucked up
02:05:31 <strcat[m]> that's the 'gnu linker'
02:05:57 <strcat[m]> ld.gold was a replacement that's far faster / more capable but they didn't really care and Google moved on to LLVM so it's dead and probably shouldn't be used anymore
02:05:58 <strcat[m]> should use LLD
02:06:08 <strcat[m]> AOSP and the NDK already moved to LLD
02:06:14 <strcat[m]> kernel builds haven't yet but should
02:06:33 <strcat[m]> will make linking the kernel much faster and can support thinlto
02:07:43 <strcat[m]> https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/master/ui/build/paths/config.go#76
02:07:52 <strcat[m]> ah so this is a full list of tools that can be used from the host
02:07:53 <strcat[m]> in master
02:08:15 <strcat[m]> and 'can be' doesn't mean that's what it uses normally (has openjdk prebuilts for example)
02:10:32 <strcat[m]> so we could use this list and figure out what's actually needed
02:13:07 <TheJollyRoger> Wow.
02:15:00 <strcat[m]> rsync is such a badly made tool without a good replacement
02:16:08 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: you'll be happy to hear that rsync replaced md4 with md5 in 2008 and made no progress since then
02:16:19 <TheJollyRoger> ...Oh god.
02:16:40 <JTL> Jesus fuck
02:16:42 * TheJollyRoger turns green.
02:16:51 <JTL> Who thought that was a good idea
02:18:52 <TheJollyRoger> That's insane... aaargh.
02:19:34 <strcat[m]> it's what it uses to compare if files are the same
02:19:37 <strcat[m]> which has security implications
02:20:10 <strcat[m]>        -c, --checksum
02:20:10 <strcat[m]>               This  changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in need of a transfer.  Without this option, rsync uses a "quick check" that (by
02:20:10 <strcat[m]>               default) checks if each file’s size and time of last modification match between the sender and receiver.
02:20:11 <strcat[m]> when you use -c
02:20:16 <strcat[m]> >               For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the checksum used is MD5.  For older protocols, the checksum used is MD4.
02:20:25 * TheJollyRoger starts feeling sick.
02:20:50 <strcat[m]> checksum should really be the default
02:21:01 <strcat[m]> guessing based on size + last mod time is kinda bad
02:21:19 <strcat[m]> sometimes last mod time is set to a placeholder such as when doing reproducible builds
02:21:42 <strcat[m]> generating a filesystem or archive that's reproducible (so file metadata has to match)
02:21:54 <strcat[m]> rsync has so many options and the UX is really bad
02:21:58 <strcat[m]> it has a weird way of doing things
02:22:10 <strcat[m]> it changes behavior based on whether you use an explicit / at the end of directories
02:22:18 <strcat[m]> and it's hard to remember which way it works with different options / parameters
02:22:49 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/grapheneos.org/blob/master/deploy_static#L21 it's good at doing stuff like this
02:22:52 <strcat[m]> delta-based sync
02:22:56 <strcat[m]> updates only changed files using deltas
02:23:51 <TheJollyRoger> It... it just uses md5 to compute the differences?
02:24:49 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it uses md5 to check if it needs to do anything (or md4 for the older protocol)
02:25:05 <strcat[m]> it uses an internal rdiff algorithm for calculating the difference and sending that
02:25:15 <strcat[m]> and then it does another checksum to make sure it transferred correctly
02:25:19 <strcat[m]> with md4/md5
02:25:37 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: rsync is usually used over ssh but it used to be used over rsh (basically telnet)
02:25:49 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: it still has support for rsh if you do ./configure --with-rsh it uses rsh instead of ssh
02:26:01 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: and rsync also has a NATIVE protocol where you run an rsync server
02:26:13 <strcat[m]> and I think that's totally insecure, no authentication of data or  encryption
02:26:24 <TheJollyRoger> ...O_O.
02:26:27 <TheJollyRoger> Oh god.
02:26:39 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: yeah rsync service has no authentication or encryption
02:26:49 <strcat[m]> typically you use it over ssh though, or just locally
02:26:57 <strcat[m]> it's basically a "better cp"
02:27:04 <strcat[m]> but it has a lot of horrible cruft
02:27:09 <TheJollyRoger> Jeez T_T
02:27:11 <strcat[m]> and I don't think the diff algorithm it uses is particularly good
02:27:19 <strcat[m]> rsync is a tool that DESPERATELY needs a replacement lol
02:27:49 <TheJollyRoger> AAAaaaaa X(
02:28:02 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://librsync.github.io/ is a reimplementation of the rsync delta protocol without the insecure wire protocol
02:28:14 <strcat[m]> although it's not actually a remote sync tool - it's just the delta algorithm
02:28:18 <strcat[m]> it provides an rdiff tool
02:28:32 <aeonsolution[m]> have you looked at https://syncthing.net/
02:28:38 <strcat[m]> seems they support BLAKE2 for secure hashing
02:28:46 <strcat[m]> in librsync (unrelated to the rsync project)
02:28:57 <TheJollyRoger> Wow. I should get that then.
02:29:24 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/dropbox/librsync I like how this has 1 commit
02:29:37 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: there are probably better diff algorithms now
02:29:54 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: librsync is just a saner reimplementation of a portion of rsync, not the whole tool
02:30:04 <TheJollyRoger> Oh, darn :(
02:30:13 <strcat[m]> librsync doesn't provide 'rsync' just a library with part of the protocol (how it does diffs) and an rdiff tool
02:30:34 <strcat[m]> rdiff-backup and duplicity use rdiff from librsync
02:30:47 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: https://rdiff-backup.net/
02:31:01 <TheJollyRoger> Oh wow.
02:31:50 <renlord> is dane gonna replace hpkp?
02:31:56 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: rdiff-backup and duplicity are basically a poor man's version control
02:32:03 <strcat[m]> duplicity has encryption built-in
02:32:39 <renlord> i use duplicity, and i'd say its not cheap to provide hardware for it
02:32:55 <strcat[m]> rsnapshot is another thing that seems dumber
02:33:02 <TheJollyRoger> That... that I could see myself using extensively, on the desktop, to take online backups.
02:33:19 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger:  lol https://github.com/dropbox/librsync really amuses me
02:33:24 <strcat[m]> they only included 1 commit
02:33:32 <strcat[m]> they spelled librsync wrong in the repo description
02:33:37 <strcat[m]> 'Dropbox modified version of librysnc'
02:33:54 <strcat[m]> I wonder if they still use it
02:34:02 <strcat[m]> I hope not
02:34:09 <strcat[m]> that fork uses md4 only
02:34:42 <TheJollyRoger> Good gravy >_<.
02:34:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: I just put everything in git and back that up
02:35:11 <strcat[m]> ~/documents, etc. in git repos
02:35:43 <strcat[m]> and then just make a snapshot and keep a certain number of them
02:35:44 <renlord> git does not work really well for binary blobs, rich media files
02:36:01 <renlord> especially when in between history, you remove stuff
02:36:04 <TheJollyRoger> Huh. that... that actually never occurred to me before at all.
02:36:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: it works fine with binary blobs really
02:36:12 <TheJollyRoger> But now that kinda makes sense.
02:36:20 <strcat[m]> renlord: it just can't handle any kind of merges / conflicts or anything itself
02:36:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: although you can actually delegate that to a tool
02:36:40 <renlord> if you want to keep history snapshots of the blob, i guess its alright
02:36:52 <renlord> but i usually dont need to restore to previous snapshot
02:37:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: what kind of blob though
02:37:22 <strcat[m]> like with an image you can definitely save each revision, it's just annoying because it doesn't understand a binary image format
02:37:27 <renlord> compressed tarballs for example
02:37:37 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't provide any kind of useful diffs or merges itself
02:37:39 <renlord> sometimes i archive things i want to put away for good
02:37:54 <strcat[m]> renlord: but in that case it's a final revision of it
02:37:59 <TheJollyRoger> I could do a ton better with my backup system, I'm desperate to build a better one.
02:38:18 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: keep stuff in git, back up git repo
02:38:20 <renlord> who knows, maybe one fine day i find a dangling doc that belongs in that archive and i update it
02:38:23 <renlord> gg
02:38:34 <TheJollyRoger> I think I might do just that then!
02:38:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: well git will just be storing both revisions of it
02:38:58 <strcat[m]> renlord: if you don't want all past revisions of it git doesn't fit the bill
02:39:04 <TheJollyRoger> I was considering getting Tarsnap but then I realized all those Tarsnap credits are going to add up quickly.
02:39:34 <TheJollyRoger> So I'd thought to use Tarsnap for the short term and then keep stuff offline in cold storage for the long term.
02:39:47 <renlord> but yes, i can see how git can be a robust backup solution
02:41:49 <strcat[m]> for stuff that isn't private but I don't want people bothering me about I just use private repos on github
02:45:57 <madaidan[m]> Now I'm interested in what you have there
02:46:57 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/thestinger/dotfiles
02:47:22 <strcat[m]> used to be public but I got tired of being bothered about it
02:47:30 <strcat[m]> people suggesting things, arguing about whether I should do something
02:47:35 <strcat[m]> not what I want to deal with
02:47:54 <madaidan[m]> The secret vimrc :O
02:47:57 <strcat[m]> and now I have to be less concerned about accidentally adding something private although I never have
02:48:11 <madaidan[m]> Can't you disable issues?
02:48:22 <strcat[m]> yeah  but they can commit on commits, lines in commits
02:48:39 <strcat[m]> and you can't disable pull requests
02:48:54 <madaidan[m]> Ah
02:49:29 <strcat[m]> my vimrc isn't that complicated
02:49:46 <strcat[m]> a lot of you need this:
02:49:46 <strcat[m]>     " highlight trailing whitespace, except when typing at eol
02:49:47 <strcat[m]>     highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=darkred guibg=darkred
02:49:47 <strcat[m]>     match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/
02:49:52 <strcat[m]> always have to remove your trailing whitespace
02:50:18 <renlord> i think my nvimrc removes trailing whitespace
02:50:24 <renlord> and prints indents
02:50:25 * strcat[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/tUeLazZFOHFimYmZxIwDWJFe >
02:50:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't want it to remove automatically
02:50:45 <strcat[m]> since I don't want to make extra changes I didn't intend that will cause conflicts etc
02:51:05 <madaidan[m]> I've never really used vim excluding the times I opened it by accident and spent the rest of the day trying to close it
02:51:35 <renlord> i dont know how to use any other editor
02:51:44 <strcat[m]> I can't stand using anything else
02:51:59 <strcat[m]> and can't stand crappy vim modes for any thing else
02:52:01 <renlord> the only other one i can use is echo >> FILE
02:52:09 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't use neovim atm largely because I don't really use many plugins
02:52:12 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't impact me much
02:52:32 <renlord> if a specfic line, echo | sed >> FILE
02:52:48 <renlord> if a specfic line, sed -i FILE
02:53:07 <renlord> i cant stand nano/emacs
02:53:14 <renlord> particularly not the GUI editors either
02:53:23 <renlord> vscode bothers me the most
02:53:33 <renlord> fkin baggages that come with those projects
02:53:35 <renlord> ffs
02:53:44 <madaidan[m]> I've always used atom
02:57:00 <JTL> vim++;
02:57:45 <renlord> vim license is great too
02:57:47 <renlord> https://www.vim.org/about.php
02:57:53 <renlord> Vim is charityware. Its license is GPL-compatible, so it's distributed freely, but we ask that if you find it useful you make a donation to help children in Uganda through the ICCF. The full license text can be found in the documentation. Much more information about charityware on Charityware.info.
02:57:54 <JTL> > 19:47 <strcat[m]> used to be public but I got tired of being bothered about it
02:57:54 <renlord> lol
02:57:56 <JTL> Could disable issues/PRs and tell people to bugger off?
02:58:01 <JTL> I've seen that
02:58:26 <strcat[m]> you can't disable PRs
02:58:28 <strcat[m]> or comments on stuff
02:58:45 <renlord> gitlab you can
02:58:52 <renlord> but gitlab is really unreliable
02:58:53 <renlord> lol
02:59:22 <JTL> strcat[m]: aw sucks
03:00:32 <JTL> Some projects have bots to automaticly close PRs but that's janky
03:00:45 <renlord> could just ignore the PRs
03:01:14 <JTL> Meh. Probably doesn't want to deal with the notifications and other "spam" from it
03:01:43 <renlord> strcat[m] has admitted that he gets way too much spam from github anyways
03:01:55 <JTL> Can't say I'm surprised
03:02:04 <strcat[m]> I get way too much email
03:02:13 <strcat[m]> people send me tons of questions and complaints daily
03:02:18 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you bounce broken dkim mail?
03:02:24 <strcat[m]> I don't read half of the email I receive
03:02:27 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
03:02:32 <renlord> haha
03:02:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: hard fail spf failures, dkim failures and dmarc will be enforced soon
03:02:57 <strcat[m]> I'm still using opendmarc in testing mode atm
03:03:03 <strcat[m]> renlord: this gets rid of lots of spam and emails I don't want
03:03:19 <strcat[m]> if someone wants to send me an email and can't because they don't have dkim set up properly GOOD, less email
03:03:37 <strcat[m]> if it's important enough to send me it they can fix the problem (they get an error message when their email server gives up retrying)
03:03:43 <renlord> i cant enable dmarc
03:03:48 <renlord> it will bounce too many
03:03:53 <strcat[m]> renlord: you can whitelist a domain
03:04:04 <renlord> i already did whitelist some
03:04:14 <renlord> and also what's with mailing list and broken dkim signatures
03:04:22 <strcat[m]> On-BadSignature tempfail
03:04:28 <strcat[m]> it's necessary to add that to opendkim config
03:04:30 <renlord> i did set that ^
03:04:31 <strcat[m]> or it doesn't reject bad signatures
03:04:38 <renlord> but it still bounces broken dkim signatures
03:04:38 <strcat[m]> but the thing is without DMARC
03:04:48 <strcat[m]> a domain with DKIM set up can send emails WITHOUT DKIM
03:04:52 <strcat[m]> DKIM doesn't enforce that it is used
03:05:00 <strcat[m]> so you also need DMARC to enforce that DKIM/SPF are used
03:05:07 <strcat[m]> renlord: I have spf-engine set up too
03:05:15 <strcat[m]> spf-engine + opendkim enforcing has reduced my spam a lot
03:05:50 <strcat[m]> but atm I have the problem of tons of @gmail.com spam that's spoofed because Google's SPF is soft fail by itself - need to use DMARC
03:05:58 <renlord> hmm, not in community yet
03:06:03 <renlord> still AUR
03:06:03 <strcat[m]> really need to finish testing and enabling opendmarc
03:06:42 <strcat[m]> postfix-policyd-spf-python is what it's called
03:06:45 <strcat[m]> but spf-engine provides it now
03:07:02 <renlord> i'll just install with pip
03:07:17 <strcat[m]> https://paste.xinu.at/FhnL5/ this is my config for that basically the standard one without TestOnly = 1 and with PermError_reject and TermError_Defer enabled
03:07:34 <strcat[m]> maybe that can be stricter
03:07:43 <strcat[m]> once I have opendmarc enforcing I'll barely be receiving spam
03:07:51 <strcat[m]> I don't want automated spam filtering aside from this
03:08:01 <strcat[m]> I'd be tempted to require TLS as a way of reducing spam
03:08:16 <strcat[m]> I'd rather drop email that's just being done wrong
03:08:17 <renlord> do you subscribe to some blacklist to reject spam MTAs?
03:08:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: no
03:08:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't receive enough spam to need that
03:08:53 <strcat[m]> most of the spam I receive is invalid spoofed email from @gmail.com addresses
03:09:04 <strcat[m]> so setting opendmarc to enforcing mode is going to remove it all
03:10:00 <strcat[m]> https://paste.xinu.at/PbbL/
03:10:02 <strcat[m]> here's a sample one
03:10:20 <strcat[m]> just need to start enforcing opendmarc
03:10:25 <strcat[m]> I'll do it right now to save myself time later
03:10:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: anyway I hate email, anything that makes me receive less email is good
03:10:52 <strcat[m]> renlord: so I'd be tempted to enforce TLS too
03:10:57 <renlord> lol
03:11:16 <strcat[m]> like if people receive errors sending me email because their email server is insecure
03:11:17 <strcat[m]> that's amazing
03:11:33 <strcat[m]> because they will only persist and keep trying to send me email if it's important
03:11:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: greylisting is also a good idea
03:11:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: valid email servers are REQUIRED to try multiple times
03:12:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'm all for stuff like that - I am just not going to run a spam filter or use blacklists unless it gets really bad
03:12:16 <strcat[m]> and I see no point in putting stuff in a spam folder - I don't use one
03:12:53 <renlord> maybe can publish a shamelist
03:13:01 <renlord> of MTAs that got bounced and their reasons
03:13:05 <strcat[m]> renlord: I just don't care
03:13:05 <renlord> every month of something
03:13:12 <strcat[m]> I won't even look at the logs
03:13:25 <strcat[m]> if people are sending me email insecurely and it gets bounced that's their problem
03:13:47 <renlord> what about gov emails with broken MTA setups
03:13:53 <renlord> you cant just ignore them, can you?
03:13:53 <strcat[m]> fuck them
03:13:54 <renlord> @_@
03:13:58 <strcat[m]> yeah I can ignore them
03:14:07 <strcat[m]> I don't think our government has broken email setups anyway
03:14:14 <renlord> mine does
03:14:15 <renlord> KEK
03:14:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: if the email bounces they are going to get an error, they can't claim that I received it
03:14:31 <strcat[m]> I will have a log proving it bounced because it was invalid
03:14:54 <strcat[m]> and if they are sending invalid emails - maybe they don't want people to be aware they were contacted after all
03:15:00 <strcat[m]> either way don't care
03:15:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'm also not using this for my personal email yet, I'm given up on personal email for the time being
03:15:25 <strcat[m]> too much of a dumpster fire
03:15:27 <strcat[m]> too much spam
03:15:33 <renlord> lol
03:15:52 <strcat[m]> currently 15000 emails in my spam folder
03:15:54 <strcat[m]> from a week
03:16:06 <strcat[m]> do you really think I'm going to look in there
03:16:07 <renlord> so far so good for me
03:16:17 <strcat[m]> using mailing lists gets you tons of spam emails
03:16:28 <strcat[m]> it gets your email into tons of mailing list archives
03:16:38 <strcat[m]> and spam harvesters probably sub to mailing list
03:16:41 <renlord> but opendkim is bouncing a lot of lists.linuxfoundation.org emails
03:16:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: their list is probably set up wrong
03:16:50 <renlord> despite in my exemptdomains list
03:17:12 <renlord> the opendkim.conf docs is not really good
03:17:15 <strcat[m]> renlord: because they are probably saying an email is from danielmicay⊙gc but MODIFYING headers and content
03:17:22 <renlord> its says "dataset", but dont really specify what the format is
03:17:25 <strcat[m]> renlord: you're probably trying to exempt the FROM domain
03:17:34 <strcat[m]> but the issue is not that
03:17:45 <strcat[m]> renlord: proper mailing lists modify the sender for DKIM signed emails
03:18:05 <strcat[m]> they should mangle it so it doesn't claim to be from danielmicay⊙gc if they modified it basically
03:18:10 <strcat[m]> oss-security was updated and does this properly now
03:19:48 <strcat[m]> renlord: the issue is they modify people's emails to add the mailing list name, unsubscribe link, etc.
03:19:58 <strcat[m]> renlord: they should NOT be doing that, they should ONLY be adding headers they are allowed to add
03:20:00 <izymandias[m]> Is encryption on by default now on the Riot client?
03:20:07 <strcat[m]> including headers for unsub info
03:22:18 <strcat[m]> renlord: a lot of people on lkml, etc. think it's "brain damage" to prevent spoofing emails and they refused to fix stuff
03:22:26 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'm totally fine with dropping emails from dumb people
03:22:39 <renlord> what? 'brain damage'? why
03:22:41 <strcat[m]> if they don't want their list sending me email that's cool with me I won't submit patches or bug reports
03:23:24 <renlord> why are lkml people have such an adversarial attitude towards security
03:23:33 <renlord> s/are/do/
03:23:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dmarc/9rQfAonKX8quvJ47GObCmTuNcos/
03:23:47 <strcat[m]> anyway stuff like mailman knows how to mangle the FROM header to not falsely claim that the email was sent that way
03:24:02 <strcat[m]> reminds me that I need to enable length enforcement
03:24:28 <renlord> i enabled length enforcement
03:28:05 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-09-18-dmarc-mailing-list.html
03:29:14 <strcat[m]> they are supposed to use List-Unsubscribe and List-ID
03:29:16 <strcat[m]> and leave your message alone
03:29:27 <strcat[m]> and there, works fine, no invalid DKIM from mangling the emails
03:29:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: lots of mail server software refuses to do stuff sanely and so they have to mangle the FROM address so it doesn't falsely claim to have been sent by that person
03:29:54 <strcat[m]> but they could always just do stuff sanely
03:30:15 <strcat[m]> and yeah if they mangle email and DON'T change the FROM address to work around it (which they shouldn't need to do if they are sane) then it will be invalid / rejected
03:30:22 <strcat[m]> and I just won't receive that email - fine with me!
03:32:39 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's way better to reject email so people get an error vs. putting in spam too
03:35:09 <renlord> im not too sure about that, since the reject message usually just end up in journalctl and people dont really check
03:35:24 <renlord> i'm more inclined to record it in the Subject header or something to shame when replying
03:35:49 <renlord> Subject: [From your fucking broken MTA: bad dkim signature] -- actual subject
03:36:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: it sends an error email abck
03:36:48 <strcat[m]> back
03:37:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: well depends on people's MTA
03:37:19 <strcat[m]> but with gmail, gmail sends you an error message
03:37:23 <strcat[m]> showing that a mail was rejected
03:37:31 <strcat[m]> and postfix will do the same
03:37:37 <strcat[m]> afaik opensmtpd did that too
03:37:46 <strcat[m]> BodyLengthDB is not working for me
03:37:48 <strcat[m]> it's not adding l=
03:37:48 <renlord> uh yea, it does atm
03:39:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: hmm
03:39:45 <strcat[m]> maybe it's secure by default
03:39:49 <strcat[m]> and nothing needs to be changed
03:39:57 <strcat[m]> I just don't quite understand this bit
03:41:04 <strcat[m]> ok I think you are NOT supposed to include l=
03:41:14 <strcat[m]> using l= is what allows appending
03:41:17 <strcat[m]> without l= it does the whole body
03:43:11 <renlord> DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=simple/simple; d=renlord.com; s=km1; t=1588995525; bh=ox46pMTSiQeECirfXg0FC4rP4SAnyHcFZQ41g+gT2mc=; l=1188; h=Date:From:To:Subject; b=Udu2HT9wcmB4lB3xJF6dvVg7+/KMbgUVlW6E5ktji0HkHCW2dgk60uUVhoQPZ9tmT
03:43:18 <renlord> does append l=
03:44:06 <renlord> BodyLengthDB file just put "*" inthere
03:51:14 <strcat[m]> renlord: you don't want l=
03:51:20 <strcat[m]> putting l= is what's insecure, I realized
03:51:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: if you put l= that's what allows appending apparently
03:51:33 <strcat[m]> you should remove that lol
03:51:42 <renlord> but i enabled bodylengthdb
03:51:57 <strcat[m]> renlord: you don't want that
03:52:03 <renlord> wtf
03:52:07 <renlord> did i just did the inverse
03:52:11 <strcat[m]> renlord: yes
03:52:14 <strcat[m]> you DON'T want l=
03:52:30 <strcat[m]> renlord: if you have l=1188 it means appending after that message is allowed
03:52:39 <renlord> ok
03:52:42 <renlord> removed then
03:52:54 <strcat[m]> I realized the advice we saw about this was just wrong/confusing
03:53:01 <renlord> softfail doesnt seem to work for me
03:53:07 <strcat[m]> btw my opendmarc just broke and I had to totally uninstall it
03:53:09 <renlord> still hard rejecting
03:53:18 <strcat[m]> fucking opendmarc
03:53:21 <strcat[m]> it's so complicated
03:53:26 <strcat[m]> why can't I use it without a database
03:53:30 <strcat[m]> why do I need some database
03:53:38 <renlord> i dont have a db
03:54:28 <strcat[m]> ah that's just for DMARC reports
03:54:33 <strcat[m]> I tried to set that up but fuck it
03:54:37 <strcat[m]> the database got totally screwed
03:54:40 <strcat[m]> I purged all of it
04:00:31 <strcat[m]> renlord: email is so horrible
04:00:37 <strcat[m]> renlord: btw I can give you the setup to remove Received header
04:00:54 <strcat[m]> renlord: make /etc/postfix/submission_header_checks
04:01:03 <strcat[m]> with the contents `/^Received:/ IGNORE`
04:01:08 <strcat[m]> and then
04:01:40 <renlord> yep, i have that setup
04:01:44 <strcat[m]> subcleanup unix n       -       -       -       0       cleanup
04:01:44 <strcat[m]>   -o header_checks=regexp:/etc/postfix/submission_header_checks
04:01:44 <renlord> strips my local ip address
04:01:46 <strcat[m]> ah
04:01:54 <strcat[m]> and   -o cleanup_service_name=subcleanup
04:01:55 <strcat[m]> yeah
04:01:59 <renlord> i was so mad when i saw my ip when testing
04:02:05 <strcat[m]> lol yeah
04:02:17 <renlord> insane defaults
04:02:40 <renlord> the ovh panel + api backend does not work with ipv6 reverse ip
04:02:48 <renlord> support ticket still not addressed
04:02:49 <renlord> sad
04:03:21 <JTL> OVH - French for "Often Very Hackey"
04:05:10 <renlord> mutt does not do dane checks when sending mail
04:05:35 <renlord> unless you replace the default smtp program with something else?
04:06:13 <renlord> and if you use the submission port, does that mean you need dane setup for port 587 also?
04:07:01 <strcat[m]> renlord: you can set up DANE for anything
04:07:07 <strcat[m]> you might as well enable it for all the mail server ports
04:07:10 <strcat[m]> record for each port
04:07:22 <strcat[m]> renlord: but nothing checks it aside from a few other MTAs  in practice
04:07:32 <strcat[m]> renlord: you should ALSO use a valid Let's Encrypt cert with certbot --reuse-key
04:07:50 <renlord> ya i do that
04:07:55 <renlord> so i dont have to rotate the dane entries
04:08:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: well it'd be broken to not do it
04:08:25 <strcat[m]> cause you don't know when exactly it'll update
04:08:28 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't give you a chance to rotate
04:08:40 <strcat[m]> you'd need to do key rotations manually - issue new certificates, add new record for rotation
04:08:43 <strcat[m]> and then wait for TTL
04:08:48 <strcat[m]> then switch to new ones
04:08:55 <renlord> true
04:09:05 <renlord> and DNS TTL cache expiration is inconsistent
04:09:13 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's better to use smtps and imaps and just disable the STARTTLS services
04:09:20 <strcat[m]> I'm planning on doing that
04:09:30 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really matter
04:09:33 <renlord> i tried to toggle smtps in main.cf
04:09:35 <strcat[m]> the STARTTLS ports are just unnecessary
04:09:38 <renlord> but postfix just crashed and burn
04:09:44 <renlord> dont know why
04:09:44 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's in master.cf
04:09:52 <renlord> ya, master.cf
04:10:07 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/sY6TTz/ like this
04:10:07 <renlord> it cant run together with smtpd?
04:10:15 <strcat[m]> it can
04:10:17 <strcat[m]> it is smtpd
04:10:20 <strcat[m]> it hosts both
04:10:30 <strcat[m]> I plan to disable the STARTTLS submission port tho
04:10:31 <strcat[m]> I don't need it
04:10:35 <strcat[m]> these ports are only for YOU anyway
04:10:47 <renlord> do i comment this out then
04:10:49 <renlord> /usr/lib/systemd/system/opendmarc.service;
04:11:10 <renlord> smtp      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
04:11:23 <renlord> ^^
04:11:27 <strcat[m]> no don't comment anything out
04:11:37 <strcat[m]> you still need port 25 smtp with STARTTLS to receive mail too
04:11:53 <strcat[m]> you can just disable the smtp submission port and imap and stick to smtps + imaps
04:12:05 <strcat[m]> so 3 ports instead of 5
04:12:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: in mutt set ssl_force_tls
04:13:15 <renlord> postfix/master[10337]: fatal: 0.0.0.0:smtps: Servname not supported for ai_socktype
04:13:18 <renlord> ya i just get this
04:13:22 <renlord> when i turn on smtps
04:14:35 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's missing in /etc/services
04:14:46 <strcat[m]> on Arch
04:15:01 <strcat[m]> add
04:15:08 <strcat[m]> smtps 465/tcp
04:15:24 <renlord> thanks
04:15:26 <strcat[m]> ah wait no
04:15:28 <strcat[m]> you can add it as an alias
04:15:37 <renlord> and the defaults on arch does not run postfix in a chroot
04:15:39 <renlord> is that fine?
04:15:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's good to run it in a chroot
04:16:09 <strcat[m]> it requires moving the opendkim / opendmarc sockets inside the chroot
04:16:18 <strcat[m]> other than that not much changes
04:16:27 <renlord> where does it actually chroot into?
04:17:12 <strcat[m]> renlord: /var/spool/postfix
04:17:17 <strcat[m]> so you put them at
04:17:26 <strcat[m]>  /var/spool/postfix/opendmarc/opendmarc.sock
04:17:33 <strcat[m]>  /var/spool/postfix/opendkim/opendkim.sock
04:17:41 <strcat[m]> owned by opendmarc:postfix / opendkim:postfix
04:17:56 <strcat[m]> renlord: and refer to them as unix:opendmarc/opendmarc.sock
04:18:00 <strcat[m]> in config
04:18:05 <strcat[m]> since /var/spool/postfix will be /
04:18:23 <strcat[m]> I don't know what else will break in the defaults
04:19:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/20436
04:19:23 <strcat[m]> but I think smtps is recommended now
04:19:26 <strcat[m]> it was un-deprecated
04:20:10 <strcat[m]> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8314
04:20:23 <renlord> ok i can turn off submission then
04:21:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah and I guess they just wants you to call it 'submissions' (submission secure) instead of 'smtps'
04:21:24 <strcat[m]> to be 'standard'
04:21:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: if you call it 'submissions' I assume it will work without changing /etc/services
04:21:48 <strcat[m]> but the postfix config calls it smtps
04:23:18 <strcat[m]> renlord: and you can disable the imap regular port too in dovecot
04:23:40 <strcat[m]> renlord: I set ssl = required for dovecot and set up the TLS security stuff
04:23:53 <strcat[m]> but I didn't disable that port yet
04:24:03 <renlord> hmm, having ssl accept errors on smtps
04:24:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: what error?
04:24:29 <strcat[m]> maybe mutt wasn't using TLS before at all?
04:24:35 <strcat[m]> it servers same cert
04:24:38 <renlord> it was definintely
04:24:40 <renlord> i have force TLS
04:25:45 <strcat[m]> what error?
04:25:52 <strcat[m]> connect with openssl's cli client maybe
04:26:51 <renlord> openssl cli connect works
04:26:57 <renlord> mutt just hangs
04:26:58 <renlord> @_@
04:27:19 <strcat[m]> make sure to use smtps://
04:27:21 <strcat[m]> as the protocol
04:27:26 <strcat[m]> not smtp
04:27:34 <strcat[m]> cause it's a different protocol than smtp with STARTTLS
04:27:52 * renlord sighs
04:28:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: https://paste.xinu.at/DlrGHq/ this is my mutt config atm
04:28:08 <renlord> this is definitely a bug
04:28:09 <renlord> wtf
04:28:16 <renlord> crashes the fucking program if wrong protocol stated
04:28:28 <strcat[m]> imap_idle is what makes it use push
04:28:30 <renlord> actually have to sigkill to kill the program
04:28:34 <strcat[m]> lol
04:28:37 <strcat[m]> renlord: that's how mutt is
04:28:45 <strcat[m]> sometimes it screws up and hits an error
04:28:50 <strcat[m]> like sasl auth failing
04:28:52 <strcat[m]> and it just locks in a loop
04:28:57 <strcat[m]> mutt pisses me off
04:29:05 <strcat[m]> I really wish I could disable line wrapping at terminal length
04:29:16 <strcat[m]> so it stops splitting lines unnecessarily and lets terminal wrap them
04:29:19 <strcat[m]> I don't get why it does that
04:29:35 <strcat[m]> I really hate the mutt pager but using another pager loses too much
04:30:54 <renlord> text_flowed?
04:33:48 <strcat[m]> renlord: the issue is viewing mail not sending it
04:34:02 <strcat[m]> renlord: mutt's pager wraps line at terminal length and you can't turn it off
04:34:14 <strcat[m]> renlord: so if people send you mails with long lines it splits them at the edge of the terminal
04:34:23 <strcat[m]> so you can't copy them properly or click links
04:35:27 <strcat[m]> I can fix it with set pager=less
04:35:34 <strcat[m]> but then I don't have the mutt binds in the pager
04:35:51 <strcat[m]> less is much better as the pager tho
04:37:19 <strcat[m]> renlord: or use 'vim -R -' as pager but either way lose the mutt binds since you aren't in mutt anymore
04:37:39 <renlord> i use less as my pager
04:38:05 <renlord> oh wait no, i autoview it via w3m
04:38:06 <renlord> lol
04:38:11 <renlord> so i can parse html links also
04:38:29 <renlord> i use to use less, but couldnt extract the a links
04:39:13 <renlord> auto_view text/html
04:39:25 <renlord> text/html;  /usr/bin/w3m -o display_link_number=1 -dump -T text/html '%s'; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html -- mailcap
04:44:03 <renlord> ist crazy how everytime only after ovh support replies me their backend API will start working again
04:44:18 <strcat[m]> renlord: so for imap you just set the port to 0
04:44:20 <renlord> makes me wonder if they are more or less busy putting out dumpster fires half the time
04:44:22 <strcat[m]> that's how dovecot has you disable stuff
04:44:24 <strcat[m]> set port to 0 lol
04:44:37 <strcat[m]>   inet_listener imap {
04:44:38 <strcat[m]>     port = 0
04:44:38 <strcat[m]>   }
04:44:40 <strcat[m]> that disables it
04:45:03 <renlord> huh
04:45:04 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/infrastructure/blob/master/servers.md#grapheneos-mail-server
04:45:06 <strcat[m]> cleaned things up a bit
04:45:15 <strcat[m]> renlord: cause you only need imaps
04:45:18 <renlord> i just set protocols = imaps
04:45:23 <renlord> and it doesnt listen on 143 anymore
04:45:30 <renlord> only 993 now
04:45:54 <strcat[m]> renlord: run dovecot -n
04:45:58 <strcat[m]> I think that option is deprecated
04:46:01 <renlord> i chcked with `ss -utlpn`
04:46:21 <strcat[m]> you should set `ssl = required` and set port to 0 for the imap service afaik
04:46:32 <renlord> oh, so that gets translated to inet listener?
04:46:35 <renlord> @_@
04:46:36 <renlord> so weird
04:46:55 <strcat[m]> renlord: 0 explicitly supports disabling it
04:47:05 <strcat[m]> if you run dovecot -n I think it will warn about protocols = imaps
04:47:16 <strcat[m]> probably already has a warning in the log
04:47:24 <renlord> yes ti does
04:47:33 <renlord> why they remove sane conf options?
04:47:36 <renlord> sad life
04:47:41 <strcat[m]> yeah so use ssl = required (which forces either TLS or STARTTLS) and then that port = 0 trick
04:47:43 <strcat[m]> lol
04:47:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: dunno they prefer port = 0
04:47:50 <strcat[m]> in those config blocks
04:47:57 <renlord> that's so unintuitive
04:47:58 <strcat[m]> enabled = false would make more sense but they like port = 0
04:48:28 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's kinda funny that they deprecate smtps and then realized it was useful and made it 'submissions'
04:48:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: to go along with 'submission'
04:48:47 <strcat[m]> renlord: and now 'submission' is recommended to be deprecated
04:48:52 <strcat[m]> anyways
04:49:05 <strcat[m]> 3 ports now instead of 5, so 3 DANE entries instead of 5 too
04:49:15 <renlord> i think submissions would have made more sense
04:49:26 <renlord> unless there are plans for external MTAs to also connect on 465
04:49:31 <renlord> but they probably just use 25 and STARTTLS
04:49:32 <strcat[m]> renlord: it's cause originally it was the TLS SMTP port
04:49:41 <strcat[m]> but then they gave up on that and everyone implemented it as TLS submissions port
04:49:53 <strcat[m]>  * but then they gave up on that and everyone implemented it as TLS submission port
04:50:07 <strcat[m]> so smtps is indeed the wrong name
04:50:14 <strcat[m]> submissions is the standard name now and it does make more sense
04:50:19 <strcat[m]> just weird artifact of history
04:50:26 <strcat[m]> that's why Arch doesn't have smtps as an alias for it
04:50:37 <strcat[m]> you could change the postfix config to use 'submissions' to be more correct
04:50:47 <strcat[m]> it'll work fine it's just a port name
04:50:49 <renlord> i'll probably just do that
04:52:49 <strcat[m]> renlord: 18 spam emails since I mentioned how many spam emails I have
04:52:58 <strcat[m]> in spam folder I mean - they rarely ever go to main one
04:53:20 <strcat[m]> the only ones that sneak into my gmail inbox are the ones with university students, etc. doing surveys of people on github
04:53:23 <strcat[m]> so I flag those as spam
04:53:26 <strcat[m]> they can fuck off :P
04:55:08 <strcat[m]> renlord: but yeah atm I have no blacklisting of any kind and no spam filtering on my own email server
04:55:24 <strcat[m]> so I really need to switch opendmarc to enforcing asap just to contain spam, although avoiding spoofed emails is nice too
05:09:24 <nickcalyx[m]> Postgrey is nice
05:27:36 <strcat[m]> renlord: alright opendmarc enforcing we'll see what happens
05:27:51 <strcat[m]> got too many of those spoofed SEO emails
05:36:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: sad you can't enable it lol
05:37:44 <renlord> what do you mean spoofed seo?
05:43:50 <strcat[m]> renlord: these SEO companies scraping stuff from the site and sending emails
05:44:00 <strcat[m]> with spoofed @gmail.com addresses so I can't even tell them to go fuck themselves
05:45:25 <renlord> so if you block them, your sites get lower SEO rankings?
05:45:30 <renlord> thats messed up
05:45:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: nah they are just advertising bogus services
05:46:49 <zxwayland> hmm
05:49:15 <strcat[m]> renlord: I'll start tracking % of emails without DKIM signatures that are useful
05:49:36 <strcat[m]> wonder if postfix can mark whether emails came in over TLS too
05:49:50 <renlord> can append headers i think
05:50:15 <renlord> EMAIL_RECEIVED_OVER_TLS: true
05:50:29 <JTL> pretty sure gmail and protonmail do
05:50:36 <renlord> do they stamp emails?
05:50:42 <JTL> stamp?
05:50:45 <strcat[m]>     smtpd_tls_received_header = yes
05:50:46 <renlord> in the header
05:50:56 * JTL shrug
05:50:58 <renlord> oh there's an option to do so already?
05:51:11 <JTL> renlord: Not sure what you mean by "stamp" in this context
05:51:29 <renlord> just appending the header field in the mail header -- stamp
05:51:32 <strcat[m]> renlord: no that's something else nvm
05:51:40 <strcat[m]> it's about the received header it adds which we're removing anyway
05:51:43 <strcat[m]> and that's for outbound mail
05:51:45 <JTL> renlord: Yeah I think so
05:52:06 <JTL> if we're thinking of the same thing
05:52:25 <strcat[m]> renlord: hmm it MIGHT work
05:52:27 <strcat[m]> let me try
05:59:28 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah that works
06:00:43 <strcat[m]> gmail also sends MTA-STS TLS reports if you have TLS reporting enabled
06:00:52 <strcat[m]> TLS reporting supports MTA-STS and DANE
06:01:02 <strcat[m]> so far I only get reports from Google though
06:14:27 <joshman[m]> Can someone tell me why latest version of Chromium is being considered as an outdated browser by soany websites?
06:17:44 <joshman[m]> * Can someone tell me why latest version of Chromium is being considered as an outdated browser by so many websites?
06:35:42 <c3po[m]> Do you know if we can deactivate all sensors to increase our privacy or there are some of them that are really needed? Sorry about my ignorance in this feature.
06:58:31 <renor[m]> I'd like to know which *sensors* are disabled when switching off the sensors permission
07:15:03 <strcat[m]> josh.man: which websites?
07:15:49 <strcat[m]> renor: all of them
07:16:45 <strcat[m]> I don't see any reason for it to be more granular than that, it's the same kinds of data
07:27:03 <c3po[m]> Hi renor!
07:30:26 <c3po[m]> strcat  thank you for all your work!
07:37:49 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_native/commit/82aee39f91c2be302d39f356c0a34efdd7070695
07:38:10 <strcat[m]> it's the baseline permission
07:38:27 <strcat[m]> the only sensors not requiring it are ones that already have their own finer-grained permission like body sensors
07:40:58 <strcat[m]> if we supported devices with step counters we might need to do something about the existing permission for that but we don't
07:43:02 <strcat[m]> anyway can see there we set OTHER_SENSORS as the default for all sensors and then the other sensors not requiring it are those that override it with a more specific permission (body sensors - which has a toggle already, and step counters)
07:43:09 <strcat[m]> I don't really see much reason for those being separate but it's how they already are
07:43:31 <strcat[m]> the reason is that upstream acknowledges that not requiring permissions for sensors was a mistake
07:43:55 <strcat[m]> so new sensor types were put in body sensors (heartbeat, etc.) / activity recognition (step counter)
07:44:30 <strcat[m]> it might make sense for body sensors to be separate but it's hard to see how step counter being separate would make sense if it was done from scratch
07:44:56 <strcat[m]> and I'd guess that you could use the accelerometer on a smartwatch to measure heartbeat...
07:46:32 <c3po[m]> And does the phone app needs a sensor to know when ypur face is close to it?
07:46:58 <c3po[m]> * And does the phone app needs a sensor to know when your face is close to it?
07:47:02 <strcat[m]> apps built into the device don't have to follow the same rules
07:47:06 <strcat[m]> they can be priv apps
07:47:40 <strcat[m]> c3po: no reason a phone app needs to know the screen turns off at all
07:48:19 <strcat[m]> the proximity sensor is one of these sensors
07:48:33 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors
07:48:46 <strcat[m]> everything other than microphone / camera falls under 'sensors' really
07:48:49 <c3po[m]> Thanks!, so I could deactivate all sensor permissions...
07:49:17 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview
07:49:22 <c3po[m]> Ah ok! :)
07:50:06 <strcat[m]> accelerometer, ambient temperature, gravity, gyroscope, light, linear acceleration, magnetic field, orientation, pressure, proximity, relative humidity, rotation vector, temperature are the standard ones
07:50:44 <strcat[m]> devices can add more and they're all covered by OTHER_SENSORS
07:50:54 <strcat[m]> which is our added permission, a baseline for all sensors
07:51:15 <c3po[m]> Gteat!
07:51:20 <strcat[m]> so the only ones not covered by that are microphone / camera since they have their own permissions and aren't considered sensors
07:51:26 <strcat[m]> body sensors since they have their own permission
07:52:06 <strcat[m]> and step counter since it has a low-level permission (not a toggle) but we don't support devices with that so we have no reason to change it to use OTHER_SENSORS which would probably be the solution
07:52:13 <c3po[m]> * Great!
07:52:34 <strcat[m]> the microphone/camera/body sensors ones are superior since apps actually declare they need it and request it
07:52:45 <strcat[m]> vs OTHER_SENSORS where we have to assume all apps require it and they don't know about it since we added it
07:53:15 <strcat[m]> so even if it doesn't make SENSE for body sensors to be separate (it kinda does, hard to say) it's good that apps declare support for it and know how to request it
07:57:56 <strcat[m]> ah nvm ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION has a toggle
07:58:26 <strcat[m]> so, nothing to change
08:01:00 <c3po[m]> Thanks for the explanation
08:01:52 <dazinism> c3po: its just if an app actually uses the sensors for something that you need to give the permission
08:02:57 <c3po[m]> <dazinism "c3po: its just if an app actuall"> I don't think so
08:03:13 <dazinism> Like possibly some sat nav apps may use sensors to detect your motion,  so they can better predict your exact loacation
08:03:58 <c3po[m]> I initially thought about the phone or camera... But I read now about it
08:06:03 <c3po[m]> I'm new from yesterday in GrapheneOS and I saw that permission in hundreds of apps, so I was confused. And new apps also receive it.

08:28:06 <nadine> oops, sorry for th repetition
08:28:21 <dazinism> Have you tried the first bit of troubleshooting
08:28:48 <nadine> Same problem right now with a shorter USB cable (50 cm)
08:28:56 <dazinism> For sorting out size of /tmp
08:29:48 <nadine> yes, I have typed the command indicated in the troubleshooting

08:36:14 <nadine> Excuse me: is it important to type 'TMPDIR="$PWD/tmp" ./flash-all.sh' as a single command and not as two?
08:37:45 <dazinism> Not sure, imagine worth trying as its written
08:38:49 <nadine> I'm tryong right now
08:40:33 <nadine> GrapheneOS is installed!
08:40:54 <dazinism> yay
08:40:54 <nadine> Thank you gentlemen for your kind support!
08:43:33 <strcat[m]> doing `A=B command` sets the environment variable `A` to `B` for that command

08:43:34 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
08:44:30 <strcat[m]> it won't work if you split it up since you weren't exporting the variable you were setting
08:45:15 <dazinism> Ah, I see
08:51:45 <nadine_> strcat[m]: thanks, understood
08:56:29 <nadine> Now that the OS is installed, I seem to have only 5 apps? Phone, SMS, Galery, Chromium and Camera? Where are the Settings?
08:58:16 <nadine> Oops, found
09:05:55 <strcat[m]> make sure to lock the bootloader per the instructions too
09:06:11 <nadine> Just did, but I was about to forget
09:07:38 <strcat[m]> looks like I can remove python as a necessary build dependency too thanks to how the build sandbox works
09:07:41 <strcat[m]> testing atm

09:38:44 <fujita_[m]> I have been looking to migrate to chromium browser since Firefox is not recommended. Ungoogled is the most notable one and I know you guys don't recommend installing extensions so what are your adblock strategies
09:39:25 <fujita_[m]> And I can't live without the dark reader extension :(
09:43:55 <hitchhooker[m]> Dns adblocking
09:45:04 <hitchhooker[m]> What's best way to get logs out of GOS for app crashing due hmalloc?
09:53:31 <c3po[m]> I suppose you talked about this in the past, but is it good to connect from Vanadium browser to the google account domain  everytime it starts?, is it to act as "normal" as possible and so to maintain some "anonimity"?. Thanks!
09:55:16 <c3po[m]> I blocked it with Netguard but maybe it's good to allow it again... IDN
09:56:02 <c3po[m]> I am new and I wanted to avoid Google at all cost.
09:58:12 <c3po[m]> <fujita_[m] "I have been looking to migrate t"> You can use Netguard app and download a host file to block ads. You can also allow/block apps to internet, even system apps. Netguard.me

10:35:46 <limitless0[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): in some countries in airports they require to unlock the phone and they plug it in and extract info like social media chat logs etc etc. Can  Profiles protect against this? Say the main profile has just useless apps and (New user) Profile is the real profile with day to day use apps used with strong passw?
10:36:34 <limitless0[m]> Or wise versa as per profiles
10:47:08 <strcat[m]> give access to a non-owner profile then

10:47:41 <sel[m]3> It's pretty snappy besides this issue tho
10:50:00 <strcat[m]> sel.: so, aside from it being totally insecure and misleading? :\
10:50:19 * k-sloth[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/USWxJdJRqGSVdHTDAxwKfvyb >
10:50:55 <strcat[m]> it's not well designed, don't use it, it can't be salvaged
10:51:37 <sel[m]3> strcat well I'm just waiting for them to fix it
10:51:47 <strcat[m]> sel.: it's fundamentally badly designed and implemented
10:51:50 <sel[m]3> I don't use it personally
10:51:58 <strcat[m]> fixing it == throwing it out and not using code from a developer who doesn't get crypto
10:52:21 <strcat[m]> the app is fundamentally broken at doing what it's supposed to do
10:52:24 <strcat[m]> it's not some minor issue
10:52:35 <sel[m]3> Yeah I agree
10:54:39 <strcat[m]> properly designing tools like this takes a lot of up front design and good implementation work
10:54:46 <strcat[m]> and you are not going to get it from that
10:54:54 <strcat[m]> it's bad and dangerous, don't use it
10:57:41 <sel[m]3> Yes
10:59:33 <strcat[m]> encryption should always provide integrity and almost always authentication too
11:00:08 <strcat[m]> and should almost always be based on high entropy keys whether it's symmetric or asymmetric encryption - i.e. seed phrases generated by the app
11:00:44 <strcat[m]> using passphrases is probably a bad idea and if something does use them it should be really clear how much weaker it is
11:01:10 <strcat[m]> really important to do that right too i.e. scrypt / argon2 with properly chosen parameters
11:01:49 <strcat[m]> the person making that app clearly doesn't know what they're doing
11:02:33 <strcat[m]> and btw that lack of quality control / review where there's just a repository of terrible and dangerous software is why F-Droid is such a bad fit for GrapheneOS
11:02:51 <strcat[m]> repo full of terrible, dangerous and largely abandoned / unmaintained software with delayed updates
11:03:10 <strcat[m]> official F-Droid repo is total trash
11:05:27 <c3po[m]> <strcat[m] "official F-Droid repo is total t"> Which store do you use?, only apk,s?
11:06:45 <strcat[m]> no
11:07:34 <c3po[m]> I only know Fdroid to install free apps
11:07:54 <c3po[m]> I know the problems, but...
11:08:13 <strcat[m]> yet plenty of them aren't available in the official F-Droid repos
11:08:19 <strcat[m]> and many of those that are don't get prompt updates
11:08:34 <strcat[m]> there are far, far more open source apps for Android than what's in the official F-Droid repo
11:08:35 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "using passphrases is probably a "> but keepass uses passphase
11:08:45 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: so what?
11:08:48 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: what I said holds
11:09:11 <strcat[m]> especially for a password manager using a user chosen passphrase is a horrifying design
11:09:21 <strcat[m]> it should be a seed phrase in that case with not even an option to use a passphrase
11:09:40 <strcat[m]> that's dumb as hell and I'm sure it uses bad crypto too but there is an excuse
11:09:51 <strcat[m]>  * that's dumb as hell and I'm sure it uses bad crypto too but there isn't an excuse
11:09:58 <k-sloth[m]> mmmm ok interesting
11:10:08 <k-sloth[m]> i havent heard of see pharse
11:10:22 <k-sloth[m]> *seed
11:10:31 <c3po[m]> <strcat[m] "there are far, far more open sou"> Sometimes from Github and similar sites, but being careful with the apk before installing: virus, trackers, etc
11:11:16 <strcat[m]> c3po: you're inferring things from what I said that I DID NOT SAY
11:11:54 <k-sloth[m]> but in the case with keepass its a masterpassword sorry not passphase, but from what i have been taught in cyber is passphase is actuall strong
11:11:58 <strcat[m]> c3po: and fact remains that F-Droid is buggy app with a very low quality first party repo
11:12:00 <c3po[m]> <strcat[m] "c3po: you're inferring things fr"> No, sorry, it was me. What I do
11:12:29 <strcat[m]> F-Droid won't ever be bundled with GrapheneOS and I can't recommend it in documentation without explaining how horrible it is
11:12:45 <c3po[m]> Looking for answers
11:12:50 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean it isn't useful but people need to be aware of how flawed it is
11:13:17 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't offer the kind of review / vetting that people seem to think it does
11:13:23 <renlord> have you given your feedback to fdroid developers?
11:13:30 <strcat[m]> the usual imagined benefits of open source apply
11:13:37 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "doesn't mean it isn't useful but"> i agree f-droid has alot of flaws, but whats the alternitive other then Dev apk
11:14:19 <renlord> k-sloth[m]: work in progress, i've just been so busy with semester stuff
11:14:31 <c3po[m]> Yes, even an app with a severe vulnerability could be without updates for weeks...
11:15:15 <strcat[m]> the solution is making something that's not garbage and packaging only apps that are decent, not a bunch of unmaintained/abandoned stuff and total trash with no use
11:15:39 <strcat[m]> don't care what F-Droid does they aren't capable of making decent software, broken culture / approach and goals incompatible with ours
11:15:53 <strcat[m]> exists and is useful as a stopgap but that's it
11:16:10 <renlord> with android R, did aosp make integrating gradle builds more seemless in aosp tree?
11:16:25 <c3po[m]> But anyway I use Fdroid and if I see some problem I must find the apk in the free repository. I don't know what more to do...
11:16:33 <strcat[m]> it presents the problem similar bad software does which is that people don't make a better version because they have something bad / insecure that 'works' (mostly)
11:16:34 <limitless0[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): do you have fdroid on your phone? If so what repositories do you use? If it doesnt effect your privacy to say
11:16:41 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "the solution is making something"> easier said then done though, time and money is involved and im sure you already know its mostly community backed,
11:17:15 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: making a better replacement for the software isn't that hard
11:17:23 <strcat[m]> it's not a very big project
11:18:04 <strcat[m]> packaging only useful, sane software that's maintained massively limits the scope for a package repo too
11:19:00 <strcat[m]> it is the way it is not because of lack of resources but bad priorities, culture and decisions
11:19:09 <strcat[m]> you don't fix a problem like that with more resources
11:19:24 <strcat[m]> that just gives them more resources to expand the code with more and more features, to make the repo bigger and bigger, etc.
11:19:50 <strcat[m]> like throwing resources at openssl
11:19:57 <strcat[m]> does not fix what's wrong
11:21:10 <k-sloth[m]> Size of project doesn't mean anything. Time is Time, Money is Money. how is it possible to make something flawless when there's always going be flaws. the biggest HUMANS. i agree with you priorities, culture and decision cause problems. but in a company where hierarchy is involved and money its impossible to get the right thing done properly
11:21:47 <k-sloth[m]> and with community base projects, good luck they doint have the funding or man power to do that
11:21:51 <strcat[m]> not expecting something but rather an app and repo that's not thoroughly trash
11:22:00 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: it's not a resource or manpower issue
11:22:10 <strcat[m]> if they cared about quality they'd have quality and just far less quantity
11:22:17 <strcat[m]> it's a culture and priorities issue
11:22:28 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "if they cared about quality they"> agreed
11:22:40 <strcat[m]> give them  more resources and quality is not going to go up
11:22:45 <strcat[m]> quantity will increase
11:23:00 <strcat[m]> more features, more UI, more attack surface, more complexity, far more packaged apps
11:23:11 <strcat[m]> that is what more resources to a project like that brings
11:23:16 <BallMonokuma[m]> What would you guys recommend for a mobile mail client? Fairmail or K9-mail? (Asking for a friend/random stranger)
11:23:21 <k-sloth[m]> thats why i like MUSL library. thats a good community
11:24:15 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: there isn't really a decent option yet as there are in other cases like messaging, etc.
11:26:02 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "Ball Monokuma: there isn't reall"> ah ok, but out of the two which one is less bad?
11:26:16 <k-sloth[m]> but one thing i would like to say even if that made something  like your saying there would still be something wrong and people would still be happy. its hard to pleas everyone
11:26:18 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: don't know
11:26:33 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: requires review we haven't done
11:26:44 <BallMonokuma[m]> ok
11:26:52 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "Ball Monokuma: requires review w"> ok
11:27:24 <k-sloth[m]> like you say as long as they put quality 1st and for most, on top of security and privacy, it would be much better
11:27:58 <strcat[m]> it's just not good software and is part of what we have to replace from scratch
11:28:06 <strcat[m]> we don't have to make a messaging app because there are good ones
11:28:23 <strcat[m]> there are certain things that just have to be made from scratch
11:28:45 <k-sloth[m]> mmmm yeah i totally understand
11:28:45 <BallMonokuma[m]> ah ok
11:29:19 <strcat[m]> we're going to need to make our own apps for many things and by we I mean a future broader project
11:29:36 <strcat[m]> because the existing options are often not good
11:29:51 <strcat[m]> can reuse existing software but there are many niches where there just aren't decent apps
11:30:28 <strcat[m]> F-Droid is unacceptably bad and forking it is not a viable option, need to just start over, and a basic replacement is not a lot of work
11:31:17 <k-sloth[m]> Thats why privacy and security come into play so everyone can get behind such good communities and back them to create a open free world were privacy and security are no an issue, but good luck that happing ever
11:31:20 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "F-Droid is unacceptably bad and "> What's the issue with f-droid?
11:31:31 <strcat[m]> already discussed above
11:31:48 <BallMonokuma[m]> ok
11:32:26 <k-sloth[m]> i try my best to raise awareness but its hard when people dont care or listen, to comfortable in their own little vulnerability world
11:33:01 <nadine> <strcat[m]> can reuse existing software but there are many niches where there just aren't decent apps > examples beyond email apps and F-droid?
11:33:47 <k-sloth[m]> top excuse: "i have nothing to hide!" "will i lose money?  then i dont care"
11:33:53 <k-sloth[m]> lmao RIP humanity
11:34:24 <sel[m]3> <strcat[m] "especially for a password manage"> KeepassXC has a password/phrase generator
11:34:30 <sel[m]3> I've made mine using the diceware method though
11:34:37 <BallMonokuma[m]> <k-sloth[m] "i try my best to raise awareness"> Knowing that almost everything they use is insecure is a big pill to swallow for most people (Especially linux and openBSD users)
11:35:06 <strcat[m]> nadine: we need a bunch of apps made, lots are small little self-contained projects
11:35:10 <strcat[m]> could make a list of them
11:35:14 <strcat[m]> some are already started
11:35:36 <strcat[m]> Auditor, PDF Viewer, Updater are started and need lots of work
11:36:06 <strcat[m]> need people contributing to them
11:36:23 <sel[m]3> strcat BTW, would suggest download open source apps from Play Store via Aurora instead of downloading from F-Droid?
11:36:32 <sel[m]3> * strcat BTW, would you suggest download open source apps from Play Store via Aurora instead of downloading from F-Droid?
11:37:03 <strcat[m]> I don't have a recommendation aside from the need for people to contribute
11:37:08 <k-sloth[m]> My coding is not close to being good enough to help, but i will get better so i can help follow like minded people, got to stick togeather :)
11:37:26 <strcat[m]> need to make replacements for a lot of things
11:37:45 <sel[m]3> <strcat[m] "I don't have a recommendation as"> Yeah that's really important
11:37:46 <strcat[m]> I could list out a bunch of app projects but the existing ones need major work already
11:37:58 <nadine> strcat: is MuPDF bad? If so why?
11:38:08 <strcat[m]> nadine: highly insecure
11:38:23 <nadine> what type of risks?
11:38:25 <k-sloth[m]> what about open store? cant we use that instead of F-droid
11:38:40 <strcat[m]> nadine: a malicious PDF compromising the app and from there your device
11:38:40 <k-sloth[m]> or same problem to many bad apps
11:39:36 <strcat[m]> PDF spec is immensely complicated and includes a full programming language as part of it with a lot of complex functionality
11:39:49 <sel[m]3> <strcat[m] "nadine: a malicious PDF compromi"> Wouldn't Android's SELinux help in this case?
11:39:51 <sel[m]3> strcat BTW, would you suggest download open source apps from Play Store via Aurora instead of downloading from F-Droid?
11:39:54 <strcat[m]> it's very comparable to web content with JavaScript
11:40:42 <strcat[m]> sel.: security features existing does not make it a non-issue for an app to be full of remote code execution vulnerabilities
11:41:24 <strcat[m]> PDF handling written in C and C++ code, especially a badly made legacy codebase with little maintenance/hardening, is not good
11:41:48 <sel[m]3> Yeah that's no excuse for the app but I was mainly thinking about the strict sandbox
11:41:53 <strcat[m]> it's like a web browser without all the focus on sandboxing / auditing / fuzzing / hardening to make it less bad
11:42:09 <sel[m]3> I'm a noob so excuse some of my questions :P
11:42:49 <strcat[m]> sel.:  having a strong app sandbox doesn't mean that an attacker having code execution within the app context isn't a huge step towards compromising the device
11:43:05 <strcat[m]> and even if they don't compromise the device they have control over the app and anything you grant it access to
11:43:45 <sel[m]3> Oh
11:44:02 <sel[m]3> Yeah most people grant dangerous perms to the app
11:45:26 <k-sloth[m]> strcat: whats your take on WebApps the sandbox browser app in f-droid??
11:45:48 <strcat[m]> discussed earlier
11:45:58 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "discussed earlier"> aw ok ill find thanks
11:46:33 <sel[m]3> I really like that Graphene's secure PDF app doesn't require any permission <3
11:47:10 <strcat[m]> many apps unnecessarily use permissions they don't need
11:47:56 <strcat[m]> worth keeping in mind that the Storage permission is deprecated and apps should not be using it
11:49:06 <sel[m]3> Almost all PDF apps has the storage permission 😂
11:49:53 <strcat[m]> no app should use it anymore
11:50:02 <strcat[m]> it's obsolete and doesn't exist for non-legacy apps
11:50:13 <strcat[m]> if you target the latest stable API level it's not present
11:50:16 <k-sloth[m]> Thats why i use My notes, no permissons at all
11:50:45 <sel[m]3> <strcat[m] "if you target the latest stable "> Nice
11:51:03 <strcat[m]> accessing files/directories in the user's home directory, external storage and other storage providers doesn't require a coarse permission - you ask the user to choose a file/directory and they give access to just that
11:51:19 <strcat[m]> Storage also doesn't support external drives or other storage providers
11:51:27 <strcat[m]> it has been obsolete since Android 4.4 / 5.0 really
11:52:04 <k-sloth[m]> https://f-droid.org/app/com.aa.mynotes
11:52:04 <sel[m]3> <strcat[m] "accessing files/directories in t"> Like using the system file manager/app?
11:52:06 <strcat[m]> most developers don't care about privacy/security at all regardless of what they may say
11:52:15 <strcat[m]> sel.: that's how the OS works
11:52:25 <strcat[m]> you request a file from the user and the OS has them choose it from the system file manager
11:52:27 <strcat[m]> for a directory
11:52:31 <strcat[m]> works for storing / loading
11:52:49 <sel[m]3> I really don't know why devs always has this permission
11:52:51 <sel[m]3> Maybe convenience?
11:52:57 <strcat[m]> the Storage permission is obsolete - it does not support external drives since Android 4.4, has never supported other storage providers (like a cloud storage service)
11:52:59 <sel[m]3> Or they're dumb
11:53:08 <strcat[m]> and in API 29 (Android 10+) it is removed
11:53:29 <strcat[m]> sel.: they don't care about making good apps and especially not about privacy/security
11:53:30 <strcat[m]> that's why
11:54:05 <k-sloth[m]> agreed only some companies do care about this
11:54:13 <k-sloth[m]> spideroak i one i can name
11:54:16 <sel[m]3> I think they themselves don't know about the security compromises
11:56:40 <c3po[m]> Do ypu consider we should change something in GrapheneOS or leave it like it already is?, I mean permissions or something like that. I suppose it's already secure at all by default... ?
11:58:30 <c3po[m]> Even for example some connection to Google. It could make sense to act as a normal user and increase privacy in the crowd
11:59:31 <c3po[m]> But I"m always paranoid about contacting Google
11:59:42 <c3po[m]> So, IDN
12:00:34 <c3po[m]> What do you recommend or do?
12:06:31 <strcat[m]> don't know what you're talking about at all
12:12:49 <nadine> :-D
12:12:54 <c3po[m]> <strcat[m] "don't know what you're talking a"> When we just install GrapheneOS, the permissions or advanced permissions for example. Or Vanadium contacting with google accounts domain when I opem it  etc Is it better to leave it like that for privacy/security reasons?

12:13:56 <strcat[m]> see the faq, etc.
12:14:03 <strcat[m]> explains the connectivity checks
12:14:06 <c3po[m]> Disabling sensor or other permissions to apps
12:14:26 <strcat[m]> Vanadium also has to download static assets and you can see we have an issue on the tracker about hosting those - it is not a privacy issue
12:14:38 <c3po[m]> Ok thanks :)
12:15:12 <renlord> the received header does say if smtps was used
12:15:30 <renlord> in fact, it shows for the entire relay chain
12:15:33 <strcat[m]> renlord: enabling that option I found works well
12:15:45 <c3po[m]> I had that doubt
12:16:13 <renlord> even shows what cipher was used
12:16:27 <strcat[m]> renlord: yeah that's the option
12:16:36 <strcat[m]> the option does it for the last hop to postfix
12:16:57 <renlord> other MTAs also insert if ESMTPS was used
12:17:05 <renlord> while email gets relayed
12:29:53 <nadine> What is safer? Vanadium through Orbot, or the Tor browser?
12:30:04 <strcat[m]> define safer
12:31:34 <strcat[m]> safest is probably not using Tor depending on what you're doing though
12:31:39 <nadine> I don't know. Si let me reformulate the question: why Vanadium, based on Chromium, and why does the Tor project appear to make a different choice by basing their Tor browsr on firefox?
12:32:12 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#web-browsing
12:32:43 <k-sloth[m]> Just use a VPN with what either browser you use
12:33:23 <k-sloth[m]> tbh its safer to use a computer or laptop
12:34:00 <k-sloth[m]> no matter what a mobile device is always going to be less safe, what ever you do
12:34:17 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: you have it backwards
12:34:18 <strcat[m]> bad advice
12:34:27 <strcat[m]> why would a mobile device be less safe?
12:34:39 <strcat[m]> unlike desktop and laptop operating systems it actually has a proper security model and mitigations
12:34:48 <strcat[m]> and the hardware actually has proper isolation and firmware upgrades
12:34:50 <BallMonokuma[m]> <k-sloth[m] "Just use a VPN with what either "> If you're looking for anonymity and fingerprinting protection, a VPN is not enough. Also VPN over tor is useless for almost every scenario (Except maybe while using onion browser on IoS, due to it not routing media through tor because technical limitations
12:34:51 <strcat[m]> totally backwards.
12:34:53 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "bad advice"> what so your saying my qubes set up is unsafe and my graphene is more safe
12:35:13 <k-sloth[m]> i didnt say use tor
12:35:13 <strcat[m]> how many people do you think use Qubes and what operating systems are you running in it?
12:35:41 <strcat[m]> Qubes gives you VM-based isolation between guests - it doesn't make those guests any more secure
12:35:42 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "and the hardware actually has pr"> I think he means privacy-wise, in which case mobile pretty bad
12:35:50 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: that's backwards too
12:35:53 <strcat[m]> more bad advice
12:36:04 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "how many people do you think use"> qubes is the operating system
12:36:23 <strcat[m]> no, qubes is a meta-OS, what operating systems are you running in it?
12:36:27 <strcat[m]> that's not an answer to the question
12:36:45 <strcat[m]> Qubes lets you run assorted guests in different VMs - it does not make those guests any more secure
12:36:50 <strcat[m]> what it gives you is isolation between them
12:38:41 <k-sloth[m]> still unclear what your asking.
12:39:05 <k-sloth[m]>  i have different OS in different VMs
12:39:12 <strcat[m]> not unclear at all if you actually use it and are familiar with it
12:39:38 <strcat[m]> so what makes those OSes any more secure than they would typically be? the security of those is what it would usually be, i.e. really bad
12:39:39 <k-sloth[m]> yes i use it. im not a expert. still learning it
12:39:44 <strcat[m]> what you have is isolation between them
12:39:54 <nadine> <strcat[m]> safest is probably not using Tor depending on what you're doing though > Please elaborate?
12:40:18 <strcat[m]> nadine:  don't feel elaboration is necessary
12:40:22 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "what you have is isolation betwe"> yes and knowing what one is secure and whice one is not
12:40:43 <nadine> fair enough
12:51:07 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "why would a mobile device be les"> still able to be tracked by cellular, there no security to that only airplane mode or remove the Sim it self
12:51:59 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "unlike desktop and laptop operat"> So Mac, Microsoft and linux dont have any of this?
12:52:11 <strcat[m]> > still able to be tracked by cellular
12:52:15 <strcat[m]> not relevant to this
12:52:30 <strcat[m]> that has to do with the protocol itself and you can use wifi in airplane mode
12:52:34 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "and the hardware actually has pr"> how is that different to to computers they also have
12:52:49 <strcat[m]> not sure what the relevance is since you can use the same cellular protocol with a laptop too
12:53:01 <strcat[m]> > how is that different to to computers they also have
12:53:02 <strcat[m]> no, they don't
12:53:07 <strcat[m]> > So Mac, Microsoft and linux dont have any of this?
12:53:08 <strcat[m]> they don't have it
12:53:55 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "that has to do with the protocol"> yes correct, but then what the point in having a sim? and if your not home you dont have wifi all the time
12:54:15 <strcat[m]> there is wifi all over the place
12:54:23 <strcat[m]> and this doesn't have to do with whether you use a phone or a laptop
12:55:00 <strcat[m]> and it's not relevant to the topic, at all
12:55:26 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "there is wifi all over the place"> wifi everywhere but not all is secure, so connecting to a public wifi defeats the perpose of having a secure mobile
12:55:41 <strcat[m]> don't understand what you mean by that
12:56:08 <strcat[m]> you're not supposed to be trusting networks
12:56:10 <strcat[m]> network security is not relevant
12:56:11 <strcat[m]> what do you connect to via the Wi-Fi network? the internet
12:56:21 <strcat[m]> the internet is not a trusted network
12:56:34 <strcat[m]> and regardless trusted networks are a legacy design mistake, it isn't an appropriate approach in 2020
12:57:05 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "and regardless trusted networks "> then what is??? having nothing and not using internet at all
12:57:16 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: not trusting the networjk
12:57:20 <strcat[m]>  * k-sloth: not trusting the network
12:57:31 <strcat[m]> there is no reason to trust the network
12:57:35 <strcat[m]> that's why we have authenticated encryption, etc.
12:57:46 <nadine> So the whole point is to be safe (whatever it meabs) while still using networks that are unsafe by design or by definition? Is my understanding correct?
12:58:09 <strcat[m]> nadine: the internet is not a trusted network... there is no safety granted by connected to it from a "trusted" wifi network
12:58:27 <strcat[m]> nadine: inherently trusting other devices on a local network is just a design flaw, and not good
12:58:40 <nadine> yes, fully understood and agreed, I was just tryong to reformulate
12:58:49 <strcat[m]> there is no trust placed in the local network - it's treated like the internet
12:59:00 <strcat[m]> there is no security advantage from connecting to the internet via an open wifi network or an encrypted one
12:59:09 <nadine> I am on the same line, I was trying to reformulate
12:59:21 <strcat[m]> joining some wifi network with encryption gives you no extra security
12:59:23 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "nadine: the internet is not a tr"> Connecting to the internet via a trusted network means less script kiddies snooping at your dns queries, though
12:59:25 <nadine> understood and agreed
12:59:40 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: GrapheneOS has encrypted DNS
12:59:46 <k-sloth[m]> Yes so thats why i said a computer is safer
12:59:50 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: and the internet is not a trusted network
12:59:56 <k-sloth[m]> if correctly set up
12:59:58 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: uh, why?
13:00:00 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: it isn't
13:00:07 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: and "correctly set up" means what exactly
13:00:08 <k-sloth[m]> how many people use a mobile through a lan set up
13:00:09 <nadine> I am currently using on purpose an unencryted wi-fi network, being fully convinced that it doesn't matter
13:00:09 <BallMonokuma[m]> <BallMonokuma[m] "Connecting to the internet via a"> Though there are vpns and stuff, and encrypted networks just change the script kiddie with the ISP so yeah, It probably doesn't matter
13:00:16 <strcat[m]> using an OS that doesn't exist?
13:00:32 <k-sloth[m]> ok maybe i didnt explain properly
13:00:41 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: what you're claiming doesn't make any sense, is totally backwards, and you're ignoring what I wrote
13:01:06 <strcat[m]> Ball Monokuma: a VPN just trusts a VPN provider as a different ISP essentially
13:01:15 <strcat[m]> anyway, the internet is not a trusted networks
13:01:19 <strcat[m]> trusted networks do not make sense in general
13:01:24 <strcat[m]> not a sane design for 2020
13:01:33 <BallMonokuma[m]> <strcat[m] "Ball Monokuma: a VPN just trusts"> That is true. That's why I use tor
13:01:33 <strcat[m]> use authenticated encryption, don't trust networks
13:01:38 <k-sloth[m]> im not ignoring at all, i get you i know the internet is not safe and cant be trusted but everyone needs to use it
13:01:51 <strcat[m]> no you're completely misunderstanding what I'm saying
13:02:00 <strcat[m]> I suggest trying to read and understand it first
13:02:09 <strcat[m]> and doing research BEFORE trying to make security claims and give advice
13:02:50 <k-sloth[m]> i have study cyber security but yup thanks for blowing me of
13:04:01 <strcat[m]> doesn't mean you understand it
13:04:23 <strcat[m]> it makes no sense to trust networks
13:04:25 <k-sloth[m]> haha ok yeah i dont understand any of it
13:04:35 <k-sloth[m]> better study harder
13:04:43 <strcat[m]> it is a bad thing to do and is regarded as such
13:05:27 <nadine> it makes no sense to trust networks and it is not needed either, correct?
13:05:58 <strcat[m]> nadine: should use authenticated encryption, which is how things are done in general at this point
13:06:09 <strcat[m]> should not trust a network just because it is a local network
13:06:13 <strcat[m]> it's a bad idea and is not how things are done
13:06:24 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't trust anything about local networks more than the internet
13:06:29 <nadine> I understand
13:06:31 <strcat[m]> it doesn't leak anything more to them and doesn't trust them
13:06:50 <strcat[m]> there is no more security connecting to the internet via an encrypted wifi network vs. an open wifi network
13:07:01 <nadine> understood and agreed
13:07:03 <strcat[m]> and normal WPA2 Wi-Fi encryption does not authenticate the Wi-Fi network in any way
13:07:20 <strcat[m]> you are not connecting to the network in a way that proves to your device it is the expected network
13:07:38 <strcat[m]> it doesn't provide additional security even against some local skiddie
13:07:56 <strcat[m]> they can your device into connecting to theirs instead
13:08:16 <strcat[m]> it doesn't authenticate when you connect, regular wi-fi networks don't use some kind of SSID PKI system
13:08:57 <strcat[m]> WPA2 encryption is basically classic security theater and people who built technologies on trusting local networks are super irresponsible and misguided
13:09:14 <strcat[m]> should be using authenticated encryption from host to host
13:09:25 <strcat[m]> transport encryption is the bare minimum
13:09:39 <strcat[m]> anyway AOSP does not trust local networks
13:09:46 <strcat[m]> nothing sane trusts local networks
13:10:23 <strcat[m]> your own Wi-Fi network does not really give you any security that connecting to the internet via a neighbour's open Wi-Fi network would take away
13:10:45 <strcat[m]> and similarly
13:11:00 <strcat[m]> worrying about imsi catchers / LTE encryption, etc. is just silliness
13:11:18 <strcat[m]> it's (poorly) authenticating a connection to an untrusted network, who cares?
13:12:15 <strcat[m]> traditional calls and texts aren't private, they're routed along with only point to point encryption across carrier networks, you don't have an encryption connection to the other end or even to a trusted server
13:13:12 <strcat[m]>  * traditional calls and texts aren't private, they're routed along with only point to point encryption across carrier networks, you don't have an encrypted connection to the other end or even to a trusted server
13:14:23 <joeri_poeri[m]> > worrying about imsi catchers / LTE encryption, etc. is just silliness
13:14:23 <joeri_poeri[m]> not an expert on this at all, but does this mean that you consider using a vpn on an lte connection to be essentially pointless?
13:15:01 <renor[m]> <strcat[m] "your own Wi-Fi network does not "> On an open network aren't there more (or potentially more) devices to not trust? In a local private network if i'm the only user there's only the Internet (which we know we can't trust) and me, so authenticating on a network limits potential threats on the network. Why you say there's no difference?
13:15:31 <strcat[m]> renor: AOSP and anything else sane doesn't trust local networks
13:15:39 <strcat[m]> there is nothing trusted about it based on it being a local network
13:15:45 <strcat[m]> that doesn't make sense to do
13:16:04 <strcat[m]> renor: you are not reducing attack surface by using a 'trusted' network because trust is not placed in the network
13:16:08 <renor[m]> Oh, ok
13:16:16 <strcat[m]> those extra machines are treated like any other machine on the internet
13:16:24 <strcat[m]> there's nothing special about them just because they are on a local network together
13:16:45 <strcat[m]> it's a horribly bad practice to trust things just because they are on the same local network
13:16:52 <strcat[m]> that's a legacy, horrifying design approach
13:17:04 <strcat[m]> and is considered a very bad practice now - not how proper corporate networks, etc. are designed
13:17:18 <strcat[m]> you authenticate what you're connecting to doesn't matter where it is
13:17:19 <renor[m]> What kind of systems don't follow the "AOSP way"?
13:17:44 <strcat[m]> when Windows connects to a network it asks you if it's public or private, you should always say public, simple
13:18:17 <k-sloth[m]> strcat: im reading about AE, weather its local or open network. if you connect you are trusting that network. how does AE protected you when you connect to that networK
13:18:21 <renor[m]> Nice, thanks. Always learning a lot here
13:18:38 <strcat[m]> k-sloth: no you do not need to ever trust networks
13:18:49 <strcat[m]> you should NEVER trust networks and the whole concept of a 'trusted network' is wrong
13:19:01 <strcat[m]> is is security malpractice
13:19:05 <strcat[m]>  * it is security malpractice
13:19:58 <strcat[m]> it's a nice example of the difference between some random business incompetent IT setup vs. a company like Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. with a sane approach to securing things
13:20:15 <strcat[m]> which does not involve making the mistake of trusting networks
13:20:39 <strcat[m]> it just shouldn't be done and doesn't make sense, authenticate the thing you want to talk to
13:20:41 <strcat[m]> use encryption
13:20:49 <strcat[m]> that's how all modern things are built
13:21:50 <strcat[m]> no reason to reduce security to the weakest link on every local network, it's a really bad design to trust networks
13:21:51 <strcat[m]> local or otherwise
13:22:01 <strcat[m]> you authenticate things you connect to
13:22:22 <strcat[m]> if you have something like an IoT device you have it display some pairing code
13:22:37 <strcat[m]> it can make the connection locally, via the internet, via some server - whatever, doesn't matter, you need authenticated encryption
13:22:43 <nadine> you illustrte very well the concept of eductation being based on repetition
13:22:49 <strcat[m]> it should absolutely not just trust something because it's on the same network
13:23:01 <strcat[m]> that's 1990s design
13:23:09 <strcat[m]> and thoroughly debunked as a horrible approach
13:23:46 <k-sloth[m]> strcat: OK im starting to understand what your talking about. we were talking about completely different topics
13:24:04 <strcat[m]> you changed it to this totally different topic
13:24:15 <strcat[m]> you cycled through several unrelated topics
13:24:25 <strcat[m]> this is the one you wanted to argue most about
13:24:26 <k-sloth[m]> Thanks for introducing me to Ae by the way
13:26:04 <k-sloth[m]> Thats because i was talking about normal people in general not peoplr who use ASOP, i apologise
13:26:34 <strcat[m]> the same things apply to stock Android and iOS
13:26:44 <strcat[m]> and anything else sane
13:27:07 <k-sloth[m]> Yes but most people dont know this and trust what ever they want
13:27:12 <strcat[m]> I said AOSP to make it clear it applied to GrapheneOS and the stock OS
13:27:22 <strcat[m]> the OS itself doesn't trust networks
13:27:40 <strcat[m]> there is legacy technology based on trusting local networks
13:27:49 <strcat[m]> and some new badly designed things based on it
13:27:49 <k-sloth[m]> <strcat[m] "the OS itself doesn't trust netw"> Thats amazing, and happy i moved to it

18:21:14 <TheJollyRoger> That's my only nitpick with it.
18:21:57 <TheJollyRoger> I use it as an ssh dongle and I'm hoping it'll replace my smartcards and yubikeys.
18:23:14 <BrokenCog> hellos.  I've succeeded in building Vanadium in the grapheneos-build tree.  it results in a bunch of apk files ... which of those need to be installed?  and, is there a way to bundle them into the graphene image files so that the flash-all.sh script includes Vanadium?
18:23:55 <TheJollyRoger> Hey Brokencog, ah crud. I'm not quite sure yet >_<.
18:24:00 <BrokenCog> I did:  "cp Vanadium/out/Default/apks/release/*.apk external/vanadium/prebuilt/arm64" ...
18:24:13 <BrokenCog> hey there TheJollyRoger.  How goes it?
18:25:44 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy shipmate! Yarr, it be well! The tides, they be strange: at this time of the year, sixty moons ago, it would be sunny and mild, but shiver me timbers today it be snow!

18:40:16 <aeonsolution[m]> BrokenCog: when you were building Vanadium, did you download depot_tools too by any chance?
18:40:27 <BrokenCog> yes.
18:40:51 <BrokenCog> needed that for the 'fetch' and 'gclient' tools.
18:40:55 <aeonsolution[m]> thanks, im rewriting my notes and trying to figure out what was unnecessary lol
18:41:14 <BrokenCog> some of the paths are incorrect, but the concept was correct.
18:41:35 <aeonsolution[m]> im at 67800/70445 at the moment
18:41:36 <BrokenCog> also, haven't figured out what's wrong with my config that fetch and gsclient must run as root.

18:42:07 <aeonsolution[m]> oh wow, im been redoing steps with a vm
18:42:23 <aeonsolution[m]> if i mess up, i restart from a checkpoint

18:42:38 <aeonsolution[m]> what distro are you using
18:43:05 <BrokenCog> slackware.
18:43:13 <aeonsolution[m]> nice
18:43:34 <BrokenCog> I should probably do this in a VM, but I didn't want to download and build everything then find the USB wouldn't flash to the device.
18:44:41 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah, im going to have that problem; hopefully theres a way i can move the files to the host and then flash from there
18:44:55 <aeonsolution[m]> *fingers crossed

19:00:32 <aeonsolution[m]> dang
19:00:39 <BrokenCog> ?
19:00:40 <aeonsolution[m]> whats the issue
19:00:56 <aeonsolution[m]>  * whats the issue TheJollyRoger
19:01:52 <TheJollyRoger> Well it's kinda my fault, I decided I was going to go to python 3.7, then realized I might as well go to 3.8, figured I'd done this before for one computer, I just forgot how much work it was.
19:02:33 <TheJollyRoger> It's not like... bad work, it's just, I have to find out which parts won't install with 3.8 and then I have to slowly and painfully add them one by one to the package.use directory, check to see if it worked, and then add the next one, little by little.
19:03:51 <TheJollyRoger> Once again, my fault entirely, since I use the testing packages so I could have two systems that were more or less the same and at the time I did not know you could use keywords from the other architectures so I just got lazy and decided to use the testing keywords instead... and from time to time stuff like this does end up happening.
19:04:49 <aeonsolution[m]> it be our own computers betraying us
19:04:57 * TheJollyRoger chuckles
19:05:13 <TheJollyRoger> Ehehe... well... it kinda did exactly what I told it to, just... I kinda told it to do the wrong thing :P.
19:05:31 <aeonsolution[m]> case and point
19:07:04 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. the TLDR is that I got lazy and took a shortcut early on and I really shouldn't have.
19:07:28 <aeonsolution[m]> hate when that happens
19:07:52 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant tell you how many times i've run fetch in the wrong folder lol
19:07:56 <aeonsolution[m]> XD
19:07:57 <TheJollyRoger> Oh dear X(
19:08:15 <TheJollyRoger> And then "error error error no more space left on the device" XP?
19:08:23 <aeonsolution[m]> LOL
19:08:28 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah
19:08:38 <TheJollyRoger> XD Aaaaa I did that a few times too!
19:09:33 <aeonsolution[m]> classic
20:31:27 <aeonsolution[m]> the generate_release script just finished
21:04:27 <TheJollyRoger> \o/
21:04:32 <TheJollyRoger> Holy cow awesome!
21:04:54 <aeonsolution[m]> thank you!
21:05:01 <aeonsolution[m]> i know, its been a wild journey
21:05:08 <TheJollyRoger> Damn!
21:06:06 <TheJollyRoger> Wow, you got way further than I ever did! That's awesome!
21:06:51 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant take most of the credit, you and everyone helped out a lot
21:07:04 <aeonsolution[m]> ^^
21:07:25 <TheJollyRoger> Well! I hope sometime when this is all fixed up we can sit down and I can try to take notes O_O.
21:07:36 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: Very nice
21:08:08 <aeonsolution[m]> TheJollyRoger:  yes definitely!
21:08:20 <aeonsolution[m]> JTL: thank you for the guidance!
21:08:34 <aeonsolution[m]> im just thinking about the next step now
21:08:38 <JTL> TheJollyRoger: I think writing some documentation on how best to use gclient, repo and submodules might be in-scope for the future
21:08:47 <TheJollyRoger> Ack~
21:08:54 <JTL> although in the context of GrapheneOS, submodules are only used for the kernel I think
21:08:56 * TheJollyRoger starts unrolling fresh parchments.
21:08:57 <cyborgninjaneer[> What exactly did you do?
21:09:10 <JTL> aeonsolution[m]: Your welcome
21:09:34 <aeonsolution[m]> cyborgninjaneer: followed the steps on https://grapheneos.org/build
21:09:54 <aeonsolution[m]> and asked for help after doing my own due diligence
21:10:01 <aeonsolution[m]> if i got stuck
21:10:56 <cyborgninjaneer[> Built from source eh? Nice.
21:11:19 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah
21:14:02 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah! Not many people here have done that!
21:14:39 <TheJollyRoger> emerge seems to be satisfied now, so I'll be able to jump in to start the journey myself soon X3.
21:15:06 <cx2[m]> One could say, it was the aeon, * ahem, Solution?
21:15:23 * TheJollyRoger hands cx2[m] the sunglasses.
21:15:26 <TheJollyRoger> YEAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!
21:15:44 <cx2[m]> hahaha
23:21:49 <terminat0r> hey new to GrapheneOS excited to try it out.  Anyone have experience installing on a tablet device? I have a Nexus 7 (2nd gen)
23:21:49 <terminat0r> This this would workout well for me, or maybe I should try a linux os
23:22:00 <terminat0r>  * hey new to GrapheneOS excited to try it out.  Anyone have experience installing on a tablet device? I have a Nexus 7 (2nd gen)
23:22:00 <terminat0r> Think this would workout well for me, or maybe I should try a linux os
23:23:23 <renlord> no it wont work well for you
23:23:37 <renlord> 1. there is no support. 2. the hardware is insecure
23:24:35 <JTL> 2013, old...
23:25:14 <JTL> Still slightly annoyed Nexus tablets don't really exist anymore
23:25:15 <JTL> Ah well
23:36:32 <terminat0r> ikr... my n7 is still kicking, but it's not great.  I'm thinking I might get some more life out of it if I try a linux distro on it
23:36:33 <aeonsolution[m]> JTL: i share the sentiment
23:37:02 <JTL> idneed
23:37:05 <JTL> indeed
23:38:00 <aeonsolution[m]> if you are looking for a hardened operating system for the nexus 7 you wont find much, you should check out this: https://grapheneos.org/faq
23:38:15 <aeonsolution[m]> this will help you see the goals of the GrapheneOS project
23:38:37 <renlord> flash latest aosp on it?
23:38:44 <terminat0r> I won't be able to really try gOS until I get a new phone to replace my Pixel3 in a month or so... got too many other things happening atm. priorities
23:39:36 <JTL> Gotcha
23:43:50 <izymandias[m]> So is Riots encryption on by default now?
23:44:44 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: doesn't look like it is.
23:44:59 <JTL> Hi TheJollyRoger
23:45:05 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
23:45:46 <izymandias[m]> TheJollyRoger: Is it coming? or is there another client where it is
23:47:49 <TheJollyRoger> izymandias[m]: I know it's on the wishlist, but not all clients support E2EE on Riot.
23:47:58 <TheJollyRoger> Er, on Matrix.
23:48:09 <TheJollyRoger> **correction: I know it's on the wishlist, but ont all clients support E2EE on Matrix.
23:49:08 <izymandias[m]> that sucks
23:49:18 <TheJollyRoger> Even so, I would still recommend using Signal if you need security given that most people use the WebUI on Riot.
23:49:24 <TheJollyRoger> *the Riot WebUI.
23:50:10 <terminat0r> from what I understand there's kinda an issue with not being able to see chat history in channels for new members... so it wouldn't be great for public channels
23:50:41 <JTL> Of course not
23:51:35 <TheJollyRoger> Mhmm.
23:54:00 <TheJollyRoger> (I'm assuming he meant "default via PM" since I know that was asked a long time ago. I don't think it'll happen until the clients are more feature-complete. Given the general experience with a fragmented ecosystem, this could take a very long time.)
23:57:38 <terminat0r> I wonder if we'll see a robust Keybase intergration into Matrix.  I'm kinda new to Matrix, so I dont' really know what integration exists now, but we'd need to see wider adoption for it to be really useful.
