00:04:04 <igioo[m]> Could an android app could see other apps you have installed?
00:09:12 <refragable[m]> igioo: https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/fpc2av/apps_are_meant_to_be_able_to_enumerate_other_apps/
00:10:50 <nickcalyx[m]> > dmatrixs: basically what I meant was next cloud needs to be installed for restore but you can't install just any app from setupwizard, and can't restore after you're done with it
00:10:50 <nickcalyx[m]> Oh yeah, good point
00:14:50 <nickcalyx[m]> <JTL "igioo: I'd be curious to see an "> üëç
00:21:41 <dmatrixs[m]> Still no luck with Tor on the pixel 4xl. Do I reflash the device and start over lol? Or just wait it out
00:23:14 <cn3m[m]> <igioo[m] "This might be a bit off topic bu"> TikTok can't see your browsing. Those comments are very questionable
00:23:15 <cn3m[m]> Oh that was answered already,
00:23:15 <alex-resist> I'm also still here. Sorry that you couldn't find a solution. Do you have anything unusual installed?
00:24:08 <alex-resist> dmatrixs[m] one possible difference is that I'm exclusively using apps from F-Droid + Signal as the sole exception
00:26:13 <alzxjm[m]> dmatrixs: I had the same problem with you when I was on GrapheneOS (currently on CalyxOS with microG disabled, so in theory fairly similar).
00:27:03 <alzxjm[m]> I did not really try to troubleshoot it as I don't use the Tor browser. If I go back to GrapheneOS in the next few days I can try to replicate. Sorry it's giving you problems. Mine had the same error yours did.
00:29:18 <alex-resist> alzxjm[m] where did you get your Tor Browser from?
00:30:31 <alzxjm[m]> I'm fairly sure it was F-Droid.
00:31:30 <alzxjm[m]> At least the Graphene install. My current one is F-Droid and it works fine.
00:31:45 <alzxjm[m]> 68.9.0
00:32:29 <alzxjm[m]> From the Calyx local repo
00:34:00 <alex-resist> You should probably activate the Guardian Project repo, as that should contain a newer version. Regardless, I'm testing CalyxOS on Mi A2 and Pixel 3a, and GrapheneOS on Pixel 3a XL, using F-Droid exclusively, and I haven't had any problems with Orbot or Tor Browser. It's really difficult to pinpoint what could cause those problems
00:34:19 <dmatrixs[m]> Nothing funny installed. The only thing from the actual aurora store is jellyfin but Tor was the second thing I installed on the new OS and I even factory reset to try and isolate Tor alone. I've tried it from every repo now that I'm aware of. Also tried the new orbot link posted here but the issue has been consistent across the board
00:35:31 <alzxjm[m]> Clear storage/cache and try again? Can't imagine how that would help, but it's cheap.
00:36:14 <dmatrixs[m]> I tried that too per strcat's suggestion hahah no luck
00:36:54 <alex-resist> Iirc your error message was something fairly precise, regarding the execution of the tor client
00:37:04 <dmatrixs[m]> I know this device is only newly stable on GrapheneOS but I don't know if that's even a factor. What strcat was saying about the error message was pretty intriguing
00:38:06 <alex-resist> Have you found someone elsei with a 4 XL where Tor Browser is functional?
00:38:49 <dmatrixs[m]> Not yet alex-resist. Doesn't seem to be a whole lot of the device running it yet. One dude on reddit with the device telling me he's got the same issue
00:41:18 <alex-resist> Disclaimer: this is again speculation for my part. Could you look for folks running the Pixel 4 XL with the stock OS, maybe they have similar issues?
00:41:56 <dmatrixs[m]> If the device is the root cause I'm not sure who'd have to address it in an update, GrapheneOS or Guardian. But again I'm so new to the platform I don't even know if that's a valid thought process
00:42:23 <alex-resist> When did you flash your current GrapheneOS?
00:42:27 <dmatrixs[m]> And yea that's definitely something to look into on my end
00:42:33 <dmatrixs[m]> 3 days ago
00:42:56 <alex-resist> And afterwards F-Droid, and then Tor Browser, and then you ran into that issue?
00:44:26 <nickcalyx[m]> > Have you found someone elsei with a 4 XL where Tor Browser is functional?
00:44:26 <nickcalyx[m]> CalyxOS users on a 4xl would all have tor browser
00:45:24 <alex-resist> And does it work?
00:45:30 <nickcalyx[m]> Ask,in,the CalyxOS room
00:46:00 <nickcalyx[m]> Pretty sure it does but I dont have a pixel 4
00:46:18 <alex-resist> The thing is, the error message that dmatrixs[m] posted some hours ago indicated a permissions problem. It was something quite specific that could be seen in the Tor Browser logs.
00:46:46 <alex-resist> - Unable to start Tor: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/data/app/org.torproject.torbrowser-tbWHM8a7aMmco_07tN1dqQ==/lib/arm64/libTor.so" (in directory "/data/user/0/org.torproject.torbrowser/app_torservice"): error=13, Permission denied
00:47:01 <alex-resist> That was the killer (copied from the logs they posted a while ago)
00:47:31 <nickcalyx[m]> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
00:52:11 <alex-resist> dmatrixs[m] I think you should contact the Tor folks and file an issue. They are probably more knowledgable about the potential root cause
00:52:34 <dmatrixs[m]> Indeed
00:52:40 <renlord> execmem?
00:52:47 <renlord> lol
00:52:48 <dmatrixs[m]> Woa that sticker too big
00:52:55 <renlord> strcat[m]: ^
00:53:02 <renlord> re: app_torservice
01:00:23 <alex-resist> dmatrixs[m] I've exhausted my knowledge. No ideas anymore. If you're running a fresh install, maybe you can reset your phone and try again. Don't do anything except installing F-Droid and then Tor Browser from the Guardian Project repo. If that doesn't work, you're likely onto something more serious.
01:01:22 <alzxjm[m]> Or just download it from the Tor website?
01:01:37 <dmatrixs[m]> Tried that as well!
01:01:46 <dmatrixs[m]> I will definitely try the fresh install again
01:02:30 <alex-resist> You could also install GrapheneOS 2020.08.03.22
01:02:32 <dmatrixs[m]> But not before making sure I know how to restore from a backup hahah.
01:02:34 <alex-resist> It just came out
01:03:07 <renlord> alex-resist: do you have the full logs
01:03:26 <alex-resist> renlord: no, dmatrixs[m] is having those issues
01:03:42 <renlord> lines before and after the permission denied
01:03:45 <dmatrixs[m]> That update will get pushed out automatically very soon then will it not?
01:04:15 <renlord> looks to me is taht the tor app is doing things its not suppose to do
01:04:25 <alex-resist> Yes, probably within 24-48 hours the update will be there
01:05:39 <renlord> we restrict execmem
01:06:40 <alex-resist> renlord: I'm just the mediator, trying to help. My Tor stuff is working fine. Maybe dmatrixs[m] can provide more logs
01:07:10 <renlord> stock repo on fdroid also typically ship very old versions of applications
01:07:28 <dmatrixs[m]> I'll provide anything I can. How can I acquire what's beyond that error message ?
01:07:53 <renlord> dmatrixs[m]: `adb logcat` and then try to launch the app
01:08:03 <alex-resist> renlord: we already checked that, Orbot and Tor Browser are up to date, even newer than on Aurora. Apart from that the delay can range from a couple of days to maybe 2 weeks, but nothing grave
01:08:06 <renlord> and then copy all the relevent logs since startup
01:09:05 <dmatrixs[m]> Ah OK. Only experience with the adb commands so far is the initial flash but I will get to it soon as I can
02:53:11 <sukiyakiwestern> So the app I use for deliveries has ads. They're Google AdSense. How is that possible on Graphene? I guess its pinging their servers without GSF
02:56:19 <prion_disease[m]> Apps don't need GSF to display ads
02:57:04 <sukiyakiwestern> just wondering. I don't really mind
03:19:47 <dmatrixs[m]> Shit on that note  I really want to grab discord and Phillips hue from the aurora store but idk if GrapheneOS actually block the listed Google trackers. I'm just resisting based on principle for now
03:23:49 <sukiyakiwestern> Discord works, just no notifs
03:24:15 <sukiyakiwestern> And I have tp link lightbulbs and the app works fine
04:10:38 <dmatrixs[m]> <sukiyakiwestern "Discord works, just no notifs"> Do you know if the google trackers listed are actually blocked? All I know from my reading on GrapheneOS.org is that Play Services are blocked. I don't know if that means all google trackers as well. But yea this device would feel more at home with discord. And I'll check out tp link thank you!
04:12:01 <faxing[m]> I'd say that Graphene doesn't block them
04:12:15 <strcat[m]> dmatrixs: GrapheneOS doesn't "block" Play Services
04:12:22 <strcat[m]> Play Services isn't included in AOSP
04:12:24 <faxing[m]> just block Google stuff with Blockada or NextDNS and use the anti privacy apps in another user profile
04:12:27 <strcat[m]> AOSP doesn't have Google apps and services
04:12:32 <strcat[m]> you're misunderstanding something substantially
04:12:50 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't censor internet access with arbitrary hard-wired content blocking
04:12:55 <strcat[m]> not sure what gave you that impression
04:13:14 <faxing[m]> I don't think that's necessarily what he was saying
04:13:31 <faxing[m]> I wont speak for him though
04:14:07 <faxing[m]> Either way he was just asking a question, seems a bit aggressive to someone just askin but i dunno man
04:14:22 <faxing[m]> awesome os either way
04:14:39 <strcat[m]> if you don't want answers to questions please don't ask here
04:15:26 <dmatrixs[m]> No no its all good
04:15:47 <dmatrixs[m]> I definitely want answers and I definitely misused the word
04:16:26 <ShortRound[m]> Does the Signal app work in GrapheneOS?
04:17:44 <dmatrixs[m]> 'GrapheneOS will never include either Google Play Services or another implementation of Google services like microG'
04:17:44 <dmatrixs[m]> Never include =\= block I'm just trying to learn how the services are delivered and how they can be not included/how the non inclusion affects apps I would download from the aurora store
04:19:04 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS doesn't have Play Services
04:19:19 <renlord> ShortRound[m]: yes
04:19:38 <strcat[m]> Play Services is a suite of components that has to be built into the OS
04:19:42 <ShortRound[m]> renlord: Thank you.
04:19:42 <strcat[m]> it isn't, so it isn't available for GrapheneOS
04:20:00 <strcat[m]> there is no such thing as GrapheneOS with Play Services, it's not an option that's available
04:21:11 <strcat[m]> if an app is given the Network permission it can connect to the internet
04:21:38 <strcat[m]> you either allow it or you don't, trying to do fine-grained filtering can't really work
04:21:51 <strcat[m]> the app can connect to whatever third party servers it wants via their own server if you're allowing that
04:22:40 <strcat[m]> if you don't trust an app with access to data, don't give it access to the data - you generally don't need to think about much else
04:23:12 <renlord> strcat[m]: with the attestation history PR, pagination to be done client side?
04:23:18 <strcat[m]> the Network toggle has a narrow use case and a finer-grained version simply wouldn't provide what people think it would
04:23:21 <strcat[m]> renlord: no
04:23:27 <dmatrixs[m]> Roger. So the trackers listed in the aurora store, those are all strictly web based then and not part of play services?
04:23:30 <renlord> right now, when i click on show attestation history, it lags my browser for a bit
04:23:32 <renlord> lol
04:23:43 <strcat[m]> renlord: well it could start client-side
04:24:12 <renlord> gotta create a new api for history, ok?
04:24:16 <renlord> api endpoint*
04:24:18 <strcat[m]> dmatrixs: you can't do automatic analysis of an app to determine stuff like that
04:24:38 <strcat[m]> dmatrixs: it's not a meaningful label it just looks for the inclusion of common third party advertising / telemetry libraries
04:24:42 <strcat[m]> it doesn't mean they are used or mandatory
04:24:53 <strcat[m]> and the lack of those absolutely does not indicate a privacy friendly app
04:25:06 <strcat[m]> and does not mean it doesn't talk to those same third parties
04:25:12 <strcat[m]> directly or indirectly
04:25:24 <strcat[m]> suggest worrying about other things like not giving apps access to data you don't trust them with
04:25:26 <cn3m[m]> ^
04:26:05 <dmatrixs[m]> Thank you
04:29:21 <dmatrixs[m]> In all honesty I'm just as concerned about protecting my own data as I am with giving google the finger by denying them  marketable information. So my questions kind of come from both places
04:30:34 <BalooRJ> just for anyone who does not know: All Google apps and programs are proprietary with restrictive licensing attached to them. Hardware manufacturers make deals with Google to bundle these apps (including Google Play Services) in with Android. GrapheneOS by its very nature as a Free and Open Source project using Android under the terms of the Apache license, cannot include Google Play Services
04:30:44 <BalooRJ> https://www.android.com/gms/
04:31:35 <strcat[m]> we're free to license Play Services doesn't make any sense though
04:31:48 <strcat[m]> there cannot be GrapheneOS with Play Services it just doesn't make sense
04:31:56 <strcat[m]> we change components that it would be providing
04:32:04 <strcat[m]> it doesn't even make sense as an alternate OS
04:32:06 <strcat[m]> it can't exist
04:32:21 <strcat[m]> you're free to use AOSP and license Play Services that's what manufacturers themselves do
04:32:38 <strcat[m]> but then you're replacing assorted AOSP components with Google's builds of them shipped via the Play Store
04:32:54 <strcat[m]> and Play itself is deeply integrated into the OS
04:32:57 <strcat[m]> it's not some app
04:33:19 <strcat[m]> it's a set of privileged apps / components that has to be added into the OS
04:33:26 <strcat[m]> and it overrides some AOSP components
04:33:35 <BalooRJ> Yes, they've closely intertwined their proprietary apps that they make money off of in various ways into the Android OS so that Android barely functions without the licensed Google apps
04:33:38 <strcat[m]> anyways there is no such thing as GrapheneOS with Play Services and cannot be, it can't exist
04:33:44 <strcat[m]> that's not true
04:33:55 <strcat[m]> and you're misunderstanding what I said
04:35:16 <BalooRJ> I meant from and end user perspective, not from a strictly technical perspective. I use GrapheneOS myself, and appreciate the work you've put into the project.
04:37:00 <BalooRJ> I am also curious to see what is exactly in the Google Mobile Services licensing term, as this varies from country to country after the hefty EU fine against Google.
04:37:18 <strcat[m]> Android functions just fine without Play Services
04:37:31 <strcat[m]> developers choose to have their apps depend on Google services via Play Services
04:37:53 <nikitalita[m]> what do people use for their maps replacement? I see a number of open street maps clients but i'm wondering which one is the most usable
04:37:59 <strcat[m]> and many choose to avoid that as a hard depencency
04:38:04 <strcat[m]>  * and many choose to avoid that as a hard dependency
04:38:05 <renlord> nikitalita[m]: i just use google maps
04:38:34 <BalooRJ> I agree that it functions extremely well without play services. But you yourself have spoken about how the AOSP apps are not really developed and quite flawed, like the basic Calendar and Camera apps.
04:38:42 <nikitalita[m]> that seems like it would defeat the purpose
04:38:51 <BalooRJ> nikitalita: OSMAnd+ is what I use
04:38:52 <renlord> nikitalita[m]: what purpose?
04:39:13 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: that's not the OS
04:39:18 <strcat[m]> those are sample apps
04:39:43 <strcat[m]> you seem to think the Calendar app exists for end users
04:39:44 <strcat[m]> it doesn't
04:40:02 <strcat[m]> it exists as an example of a super minimal camera app able to pass the test suite
04:40:05 <strcat[m]> you aren't supposed to ship that
04:40:15 <strcat[m]>  * it exists as an example of a super minimal calendar app able to pass the test suite
04:40:30 <strcat[m]>  * you aren't supposed to ship that in a finished product
04:41:22 <BalooRJ> Of course not, they're not up to that level. but Google knows hardware manufacturers wouldn't need its proprietary apps if they were shipping totally free unbranded apps with the OS, so you're left with many hardware manufacturers simply out of pressure requiring to get the GMS license with AOSP.
04:41:25 <strcat[m]> there are plenty of calendar apps that work without Play Services
04:41:40 <nikitalita[m]> renlord:
04:41:43 <nikitalita[m]> privacy?
04:41:51 <renlord> sigh we have this discussion about GMS almost on a monthly basis
04:41:54 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: manufacturers don't license Play Services to get some apps like Calendar
04:41:55 <renlord> why dont people just read the logs
04:42:04 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: you're incredibly wrong and misinformed
04:42:13 <strcat[m]> there are MANY calendar apps available
04:42:15 <strcat[m]> and camera apps
04:42:17 <strcat[m]> and keyboards
04:42:22 <nikitalita[m]> @ren
04:42:33 <renlord> nikitalita[m]: i dont use it with a profile?
04:42:35 <nikitalita[m]> renlord: can you direct me to what you're speaking about?
04:42:56 <renlord> and google maps' user experience is just way ahead of osmand+
04:43:02 <strcat[m]> I don't see why anyone would care if AOSP has some fancy calendar app or not
04:43:04 <cn3m[m]> ^
04:43:06 <strcat[m]> I'd rather it has none
04:43:21 <renlord> you're free to use wtv mapping application you so please, i personally just use google maps
04:43:56 <strcat[m]> don't want a bunch of bundled apps
04:44:07 <BalooRJ> strcat: I am all ears as to what the true reason for obtaining the GMS license.
04:44:26 <strcat[m]> Google Calendar isn't part of Play Services
04:44:44 <BalooRJ> No one said that it was.
04:44:50 <strcat[m]> Google Camera isn't part of Play Services
04:44:56 <strcat[m]> Google Camera isn't available to manufacturers
04:48:14 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: what you were saying is untrue and doesn't make sense
04:48:40 <strcat[m]> and we don't need AOSP to have a bunch of mediocre bundled apps
04:48:47 <strcat[m]> it won't help us one bit
04:49:14 <BalooRJ> that phone manufacturers get the GMS license for the bundle of apps? So again I'll ask, what is the main purpose of the GMS. I am genuinely curious, not being sarcastic. I am doing some research on Google's use of FLOSS software
04:49:46 <cn3m[m]> ^
04:49:54 <cn3m[m]> less is more
04:50:43 <cn3m[m]> <BalooRJ "that phone manufacturers get the"> GMS gives you play store and cloud messaging support
04:50:57 <renlord> its like canonical bundled services that ship with ubuntu
04:51:17 <BalooRJ> Yes, and AOSP without the Play Store is Linux with no repository really.
04:51:22 <renlord> do you need them to run gnu/linux? no
04:51:37 <renlord> heck you dont even need gnu tools to run a linux distro
04:51:45 <BalooRJ> now the cloud messaging support I'm curious to know more about, because I've only read about GMS in terms of push notifications for messaging.
04:52:35 <renlord> BalooRJ: many applications rely on google cloud messaging for push notifications
04:52:59 <renlord> now rebranded firebase cloud messaging
04:53:18 <renlord> many application just ping firebase to see if their apps have notifications
04:53:28 <BalooRJ> I see, so the push notifications framework relies on GCM. Is GCM separate from Play Services or one part of Play Services?
04:53:47 <renlord> there are other services that offer similar functionality like https://pusher.com/
04:54:02 <renlord> FCM ships with Play Services
04:54:17 <BalooRJ> got
04:54:19 <BalooRJ> got it.
04:54:27 <renlord> it'd be a background service that ships with the OS that polls
04:54:43 <renlord> back in the days when push notifications was really new, every app would have their own background service
04:54:53 <renlord> and they will ask for a timeslice ==> very bad battery
04:54:56 <BalooRJ> I do think the Chrome browser and Youtube play a big role in GSM as well. I view the GSM license as a free way of doing the same thing what Microsoft did with IE and Windows 98, which eventually got them sued by the US DOJ.
04:55:03 <renlord> since the phone needs to wake up and spin a lot more often than it should
04:55:23 <BalooRJ> It's hard to envision a phone shipped to consumers with no web browser, though currently due to the EU fines Google is not allowed to do this.
04:55:23 <renlord> then google came along with the idea of one BG service to rule them all to save battery life
04:55:44 <renlord> so the phone only wakes just for that one poll, as oppose to X number of polls where X is the number of apps you have
04:55:53 <BalooRJ> ahhh, I see. So instead of a bunch of apps individually pinging the phone, you have one app pinging the phone for every notification
04:56:03 <renlord> 1 background service.
04:56:15 <BalooRJ> makes sense. I can imagine that's probably why so many developers rely on this as well?
04:56:38 <renlord> yes, it is pushed as recommended app development practice now
04:57:39 <renlord> Chrome/YT does not ship with GSM
04:57:55 <renlord> they might use some services provided by GSM, but they are completely unrelated to GSM.
04:58:49 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: manufacturers primarily include Play Services to have Play Services... not Google apps
04:58:54 <strcat[m]> it's Google that wants them to bundle more of their apps
04:59:05 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure where your confusion comes from
04:59:22 <strcat[m]> they want Play Services for Play Services, users can just install Google apps themselves if they want them
04:59:52 <strcat[m]> Play Services / Store is why they include it
05:00:27 <strcat[m]> I don't see why anyone would care if AOSP has an actively developed music app, calendar app, etc. in the source tree - it's not something that benefits from being a system app at all
05:02:47 <BalooRJ> well of course Google wants these apps pre-bundled and uninstallable. But I do think that a majority of phone users are not technical in nature at all and will make complaints if there are apps missing from their phone that they expect to be there. It's a stupid notion, but there are a lot of people out there who expect something like Maps to be preinstalled. Especially if a user is coming from the iPhone experience which has an ourageous
05:02:47 <BalooRJ> amount of apps preinstalled.
05:04:26 <BalooRJ> Google uses that simple mindset to their advantage I think. Just my opinion though, not gospel. I think especially an older crowd would struggle to even find some of the programs with the functions many take for granted like a keyboard or an email app that us as power users are dedicated to finding the best FLOSS version of.
05:05:00 <renlord> imo, this is veering off-topic
05:05:37 <BalooRJ> it's true, my apologies happy to take it to #grapheneos-offtopic
05:05:39 <renlord> there's no pre-conceived notion that an operating system project should or should not ship bundled applications nor services.
05:06:13 <renlord> and the ethics and commercial implications arising from them most certainly do not fit the scope of this forum
05:06:36 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: manufacturers can bundle the apps they want
05:06:41 <strcat[m]> you realize there are plenty of calendar apps?
05:06:53 <strcat[m]> a manufacturer like LG can choose which calendar app, music app, etc. that they bundle
05:06:58 <strcat[m]> really not sure what you are talking about
05:07:18 <strcat[m]> makes no sense and you completely misunderstand what Play Services is, what it provides and why manufacturers license it and agree to the terms required
05:07:29 <strcat[m]> and you don't seem to get what the issue is
05:07:30 <strcat[m]> at all
05:07:53 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: if we wanted to bundle a calendar app we are free to do that, we don't
05:07:54 <strcat[m]> that is our choice
05:07:54 <strcat[m]> has NOTHING to do with Play Services
05:08:01 <strcat[m]> you couldn't be more wrong about it
05:08:32 <strcat[m]> and whether apps are open source or not is a totally different topic
05:08:58 <strcat[m]> plenty of closed source apps work without Play Services include nearly any Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. app
05:09:16 <strcat[m]>  * plenty of closed source apps work without Play Services including nearly any Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. app
05:09:44 <strcat[m]> you don't know what you're talking about
05:10:20 <strcat[m]> Play Services is not a suite of apps
05:10:29 <strcat[m]> it's not user-facing
05:10:50 <BalooRJ> I don't think whether GrapheneOS includes a calendar app has anything to do with Play Services, apologies if you misunderstood me. I was merely stating that Play Services was part of the GMS. And that's why there is no Play Services in GrapheneOS.
05:10:54 <strcat[m]> other than settings
05:11:14 <strcat[m]> BalooRJ: well, that's wrong
05:11:23 <strcat[m]> it's not why Play Services is not included in GrapheneOS
05:11:41 <BalooRJ> Which you corrected me earlier stating that Play Services does not work with the nature of the GrapheneOS project.
05:12:06 <strcat[m]> and the baseline of what most manufacturers want that are including it is Play Services (i.e. a bunch of Google APIs for apps to use) and the Play Store
05:12:16 <strcat[m]> they can already bundle whatever apps they want
05:12:29 <strcat[m]> whatever stores they want too
05:12:43 <strcat[m]> there is not a shortage of apps available to fill roles like a calendar
05:13:24 <strcat[m]> and I don't really see why AOSP as an OS should have things like a calendar app, etc. developed as part of the base OS anyway
05:13:32 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much sense to me
05:14:23 <strcat[m]> the reason it has sample apps to fill those roles is to demonstrate the minimal implementation needed to provide standard APIs used by other apps
05:14:50 <strcat[m]> that has been the purpose of those apps for a long time and they are actively developed for those purposes
05:15:17 <strcat[m]> i.e. the calendar app is actively developed as a sample of standard, stable calendar APIs available to apps
05:15:48 <strcat[m]> so a developer of a calendar app can choose to implement those APIs and pass the same tests
05:15:57 <strcat[m]> and then manufacturers can bundle that as the calendar app
05:16:04 <strcat[m]> and there are many apps available filling those roles
05:22:27 <dmatrixs[m]> On the real though fam how can I remove the text from the icons on my home screen? Landscape mode looks hella sleek without it üòù
05:23:30 <strcat[m]> we aren't going to bundle assorted apps when they can just be installed
05:23:41 <strcat[m]> why bundle an app like Signal and then deal with problems tied to that
05:23:48 <JTL> I think that's fair
05:23:50 <strcat[m]> what happens if it stops being a good choice in the future
05:23:53 <strcat[m]> and we can't ever remove it
05:24:40 <strcat[m]> we don't want to bundle apps we don't develop ourselves
05:24:50 <strcat[m]> don't want to bundle stuff outside our control where the direction can go some horrible way
05:24:52 <strcat[m]> the license can change
05:24:56 <strcat[m]> it can be abandoned
05:24:58 <strcat[m]> and then what
05:25:04 <strcat[m]> or maybe a new better app comes along
05:25:11 <strcat[m]> better to let users switch over
05:25:23 <strcat[m]> why hard-wire a specific app into the OS
05:25:33 <strcat[m]> unless it's something required to fulfil the minimal baseline functionality
05:26:15 <strcat[m]> so for example we need a music app but it doesn't have to be user-facing it just has to play files passed by other apps - AOSP has a sample app for that, and we don't really want a more complex one
05:26:25 <strcat[m]> just the most minimal possible versions of those things that must be bundled
05:26:37 <strcat[m]> and then someone can install the music app of their choice and set that as the default instead
05:26:43 <strcat[m]> why should we choose some 20MB music app arbitrarily and bundle that
05:27:05 <strcat[m]> instead of some tiny minimal app fulfilling the API requirements and barely being noticeable beyond that
05:27:16 <strcat[m]> so people can just choose what they want and we aren't locked in to some third party project
05:27:31 <strcat[m]> and I really don't think it would be a good thing if AOSP had more apps bundled
05:42:07 <barstool[m]> Is this chat always hostile to people learning? Nor sure if there's a different room for less knowledgeable people. Kinda scared to ask any questions. lol
05:45:41 <renlord> barstool[m]: questions specific to graphene os are welcome.
05:46:56 <renlord> if you are a recent participant, you are advised to keep up with the discussion and past questions by (i) reading the grapheneos website, (ii) the irc logs.
05:47:14 <renlord> if your questions have not been answered there, then you are more than welcome to ask

05:49:15 <cn3m[m]> 'DanielMicay' account
05:49:49 <barstool[m]> I just joined because I was curious about Android 11. I was just curious how Grapheme would update? Will it be at the same time that the stable release goes out or do we get it it later? Sorry if that's sounds moronic.
05:50:37 <barstool[m]> cn3m:  I'll dig into that
06:01:25 <nikitalita[m]> it generally takes a while because grapheneos specific stuff has to be applied to the new iteration of the AOSP and to make sure everything works
06:04:56 <barstool[m]> nikitalita: Thank you for the answer. That sounds reasonable.
06:08:11 <nikitalita[m]> the only really cool feature of android 11 is mainlined secure store; i think grapheneos already has that though
06:09:57 <nikitalita[m]> actually, what's the deal with project mainline?
06:11:35 <nikitalita[m]> is all the project mainline stuff closed source?
06:13:10 <nikitalita[m]> I'm just wondering if these means less updates to the base OS
06:18:29 <cn3m[m]> Android has since 4.4
06:19:45 <auspixelboi[m]> Hey guys! Anyone here from aus get the OTA update yet?
06:20:22 <auspixelboi[m]> Australia
06:20:31 <nikitalita[m]> new grapheneos update?
06:20:39 <auspixelboi[m]> Yea
06:21:37 <nikitalita[m]> hmm, I havent been pinged
06:22:28 <auspixelboi[m]> Nether. Maybe time delay
06:24:25 <barstool[m]> After the update is posted it usually will download OTA within 24 hours
06:25:22 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Ahh okay, thanks for that
06:25:33 <barstool[m]> pyxel3aXL: No prob
06:25:38 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Will try again tomorrow
06:37:37 <trismous[m]> I'd really like to see Pixels having HDMI output and Android some kind of desktop mode. Probably won't happen. We currently have no device with tablet formfactor to serve the users. If the support for above would exist we could simply then have docks with touchscreen.
06:45:53 <nikitalita[m]> the tablet market is kinda dead right now; i doubt they'll be a reference android tablet released by google
06:46:22 <Nikos[m]> There was (is?) an experimental desktop mode in android 10 that didn't make it to final release. I don't know if one just needs a developer option or a compiler flag to enable it. Search for it if you are interested.
06:48:55 <trismous[m]> I know there was, it just isn't a part of AOSP release or Graphene for that matter. And without HDMI output it is good for nothing basically.
06:50:50 <trismous[m]> I know for security you can opt-in for Apple iPad, but I like the idea of having just one device I need to take care of in terms of software updates, backups, etc. and just having a dumb dock take care of the rest.
06:51:59 <cn3m[m]> KDE Connect
06:52:55 <cn3m[m]> Links your phone to your PC locally all FOSS works great on Graphene
06:56:09 <trismous[m]> Not sure how it works on Qubes. I'll take a look. Unfortunately it doesn't resolve my issue of needing a device with bigger screen than my phone and not having to carry a heavy laptop all around.
06:57:35 <cn3m[m]> Google needs to make an iPad Mini to bring back Android tablet
06:58:21 <prion_disease[m]> How hard is it to patch an app that will not boot without Google play services to make it launch on AOSP
07:03:23 <trismous[m]> <cn3m[m] "Google needs to make an iPad Min"> Right now its just Apple, Samsung and Microsoft. No one else makes good enough devices for at least some level of productivity. Unfortunately from these in terms of security only Apple is at good level, right? Even considering Linux on Surface is probably less secure.
07:04:19 <cn3m[m]> Off topic but no Pixel Slate isn't bad for running a desktop OS security wise.
07:04:47 <cn3m[m]> Join the off topic channel and I'll chat with you the one device idea fascinates me
07:04:56 <trismous[m]> Right lets move it to offtopic
07:41:49 <lovesausage[m]> cn3m: So my google-fu failed me to find the Lineage code for privacy manager but I did find another one that seems to do something similar https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.zzzmode.appopsx/ https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rikka.appops&hl=en_US https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AppOpsManager Haven't tried it out yet. Maybe something that can be used?
07:43:33 <cn3m[m]> That's just the permission management built into Android iirc
07:43:40 <cn3m[m]> Meant for Android 4.x iirc
07:44:53 <theultron[m]> You need to use adb to change app ops permissions.
07:45:10 <theultron[m]>  * You need to use adb to change app ops permissions. not recommended in grapheneos.
07:45:25 <cn3m[m]> ^
07:49:56 <lovesausage[m]> I guess that's bad to give it elevated permissions, but still it would be a nice feature with something like Lineage privacy guard.
07:51:45 <cn3m[m]> Lineage's implementation isn't great
07:52:06 <cn3m[m]> It might be really bad, but I know it's not good
07:54:15 <theultron[m]> Lineage Privacy Guard was dropped in latest version - 17.1 (Android 10)
07:55:21 <lovesausage[m]> Really? It has been around since android 4 or 5. that's to bad. However some form of spoofing values would be nice :) I have to use some apps I dont like for work things, would be nice to be able to give them fake info :) They dropped it completely?
07:55:41 <theultron[m]> You need to use an outdated version of Lineage in order to use it. Android 9 based lineage. 16.xx
07:56:23 <nikitalita[m]> just curious, is there any way to put the pixel wifi radio into monitor mode?
07:58:14 <lovesausage[m]> So how bad would it be to give appops permisions over ADB? , it is after all a well tested FOSS app, but does it open up any other holes in the net so to speak, other than for appOps itself?
07:58:36 <cn3m[m]> lovesausage: well tested what's the proof there?
07:59:48 <cn3m[m]> If you could find an IPC exploit in the app you could grant any app full permissions. So if you install a rogue app it could essentially PE with it
08:00:21 <V0inmygym[m]> Weird. cant find search option in the new Element client... anyone using Element here?
08:01:04 <cn3m[m]> Check the logs
08:01:57 <V0inmygym[m]> <cn3m[m] "Check the logs"> where can i find it?
08:02:33 <lovesausage[m]> not really, well I know its been around for quite a while at least. Do you know why lineage droped it? Android 10 changes?
08:03:14 <V0inmygym[m]> <V0inmygym[m] "where can i find it?"> nvm, just found it

08:04:35 <theultron[m]> AOSP Permission Hub does not allow you to fake permissions like PrivacyGuard.
08:04:59 <theultron[m]> Changing App Ops also won't allow you to fake permissions. It can disable permissions for an app to read clipboard for example.
08:06:02 <theultron[m]> You can use app like XPrivacyLua to fake permissions but it requires root and weakens the system security. Totally not recommended.
08:08:10 <lovesausage[m]> yea , to bad. not much to do then
08:12:34 <cn3m[m]> <theultron[m] "You can use app like XPrivacyLua"> Check side checks too
08:12:40 <cn3m[m]> It's garbage
08:12:55 <cn3m[m]> Anyway when you give location access you open up sensor access in the background
08:13:03 <cn3m[m]> That opens you up to location tracking
08:13:16 <JTL> ^
08:13:47 <cn3m[m]> Granularity varies, but faking your location wouldn't help. It will lead to you trust apps you shouldn't more
08:14:12 <cn3m[m]> If you wouldn't run an app you shouldn't trust it with any of these half baked solutions
08:14:31 <cn3m[m]> Firewalls, permission fakers, etc
08:14:50 <cn3m[m]> The devs of these systems see one dimensionally
08:15:06 <cn3m[m]> Permissions are very complicated
08:15:12 <cn3m[m]> They group related things
08:15:26 <cn3m[m]> For example the network permission
08:15:52 <cn3m[m]> Low level network sockets, download manager, push notifications, etc all fall under this permission
08:16:13 <cn3m[m]> Firewalls don't deal with that (since they can't)
08:17:32 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS does account for these things, but it still is weak to less traditional attacks. IPC(not uncommon especially between the same dev), sharing data through storage, or even clipboard
08:17:48 <cn3m[m]> The later is almost exclusively a keyboard issue
08:18:45 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS does have plans to fix this situation though. Between improved usability for profiles(aka scoped apps) and Vanadium permission checking(good first issue for someone who wants to contribute)
08:19:15 <theultron[m]> I know. That's why I said totally not recommended.
08:23:18 <lovesausage[m]> Interesting. So how much does profiles protect currently? say I would have one profile with my trusted foss apps without any special permissions and another for closed apps?
08:23:33 <theultron[m]> I hope we are not going off-topic. https://chefkochblog.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/shhh-dont-say-a-word-against-xprivacylua/
08:24:26 <cn3m[m]> <lovesausage[m] "Interesting. So how much does pr"> Profiles offer strong isolation if you are willing to use them
08:24:48 <theultron[m]> <lovesausage[m] "Interesting. So how much does pr"> It will protect you from apps exploiting other apps or getting information about installed app.
08:25:11 <theultron[m]> > <@lovesausage:matrix.org> Interesting. So how much does profiles protect currently? say I would have one profile with my trusted foss apps without any special permissions and another for closed apps?
08:25:11 <theultron[m]>  * It will protect you from apps exploiting other apps or getting information about installed apps.
08:25:33 <theultron[m]>  * It will protect you from apps exploiting other apps or getting information about installed apps. If you are forced to give permissions like location, contacts or messages then they can read it fine.
08:25:50 <cn3m[m]> There's a weakness in F-Droid apps though that could allow a persistent malware jump. If they found a bug in the flawed by design v1 signing
08:25:57 <cn3m[m]> Worth noting
08:45:29 <lovesausage[m]> interesting read about XprivacyLUA, thanks for the explanation of profiles

11:49:28 <Exile15> Hi, anybody knows how is lockscreen unlock option is realised on pixel 4 / 4XL? They don't have FP sensor, so the only possibility is password/pattern or is face unlock realised anyhow?
11:51:10 <erhcetua[m]> i don't wanna say mistakes, but i think both can use face unlock
11:51:22 <erhcetua[m]> someone told about that days ago
11:51:55 <Exile15> I need to know for sure, spending 700+$ for test it is too much))
11:52:21 <Exile15> but if it works, i think i found my DreamPhone with DreamOS))
11:54:30 <erhcetua[m]> yeah i understand, but be aware than a face or a fingerprint is less secure than a password
11:55:12 <cn3m[m]> erhcetua: depends a lot
11:55:16 <erhcetua[m]> i may be extremist though haha
11:55:22 <cn3m[m]> generally biometrics are more secure in the real world
11:55:43 <cn3m[m]> shoulder surfing or cctv can be very problematic
11:55:55 <cn3m[m]> long passcodes and scrambled pins help
11:56:24 <cn3m[m]> though biometrics are still the best
11:56:48 <Exile15> I know, i'm advanced user without enemies) and my phone is always in my pocket) i just need it to unlock some apps like KeepassDX (i have a 64 digit password there, so i dont want to enter it everytime)))
11:56:48 <cn3m[m]> I recommend a passcode + face unlock + being quick on the reboot if you ever have to leave your phone unattended
11:57:27 <erhcetua[m]> when you have a long pass, biometrics is indeed handy and that's my setup, although my fingers tends to get moistly and wet quickly so it's a chore to use fingerprint sometimes
11:57:41 <Exile15> so it's working huh? Going to find a local store with pixels now)
11:57:47 <erhcetua[m]> so most of the time it's pretty annoying to input password
11:57:52 <cn3m[m]> <Exile15 "I know, i'm advanced user withou"> I hope that is diceware
11:58:13 <erhcetua[m]> fellow russian btw

14:27:59 <alzxjm[m]> I was also going from Calyx July to new August Beta Graphene.
14:34:03 <kuantem[m]> How exactly does SeedVault work? I cannot find documentation on GrapheneOS site or its GitHub page.
14:34:27 <SchismXL8> https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/seedvault-encrypted-backup-for-android kuantem
14:34:47 <kuantem[m]> I trued to backup GrapheneOS with no luck
14:35:22 <kuantem[m]> Thanks, I'll have a look
14:38:04 <kuantem[m]> Ive seen this video. My issue is, I only have two backup options. Internal Storage and USB. I'm unable to select USB even when connected to PC.
14:40:42 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: I wonder if the stable users would have the Seedvault issue.
14:43:06 <cdesai> alzxjm[m]: we can take a look why if you can save a logcat.
14:43:23 <cdesai> kuantem[m]: usb here means a usb drive connected to the phone.
14:44:13 <kuantem[m]> <cdesai "kuantem: usb here means a usb dr"> Makes sense. Thanks
14:48:27 <alzxjm[m]> cdesai: Is it possible to attempt a Seedvault backup after the phone is already setup?
14:49:39 <cdesai[m]> Backup yes. And if you didnt reboot the logcat should still have the logs
14:50:04 <cdesai[m]> bugreport is easier and can be taken on device but contains a lot more data
14:52:18 <alzxjm[m]> Sorry I meant a Seedvault restore
14:54:01 <crabman[m]1> How can I have save a wifi login that requires a network sign in?  I use xfinitywifi, the phone connects automatically, but xfinitywifi, like many public wifis requires a network login.  Typically the log in credentials are saved, but not with Graphene.  I have not figured out how to make this happen with Graphene.
14:56:50 <dazinism> alzxjm: app data is restored by seedvault as you install an app.
14:57:07 <ghostcat[m]> crabman: Don't you usually have to go through a portal?
14:57:12 <dazinism> If the backup is available when you install
14:58:55 <crabman[m]1> <ghostcat[m] "crabman: Don't you usually have "> Not sure what you mean.  Yes there is a username/password to login, but normally the credentials are saved with my other phones
14:59:37 <alzxjm[m]> dazinism: Yeah, mine wasn't. I got an error about either a bad passphrase or storage problem during the install wizard. I'm not sure if it was an issue with going from July/CalyxOS to August/Beta/GrapheneOS or a genuine bug.
15:03:02 <ghostcat[m]> <crabman[m]1 "Not sure what you mean.  Yes the"> Login portal to get the WiFi hotspot connection?
15:07:26 <crabman[m]1> <ghostcat[m] "Login portal to get the WiFi hot"> Yes, and those are the credentials not being saved.  They typically are with other phones.
15:12:26 <cdesai> alzxjm[m]: there is a hidden way, but it's not preferred.
15:12:38 <cdesai> it should've worked for sure.
15:12:56 <ghostcat[m]> <crabman[m]1 "Yes, and those are the credentia"> Does your password manager have an autofill feature to compensate for that?
15:14:13 <crabman[m]1> I don't use a password manager on any of my devices.
15:15:00 <crabman[m]1> Is it possible the system uses vanadium to log in?
15:16:05 <dmatrixs[m]> <crabman[m]1 "I don't use a password manager o"> How do you handle complex passwords?!
15:16:41 <SchismXL8> <crabman[m]1 "Is it possible the system uses v"> Yes, as GrapheneOS uses Vanadium WebView by default.
15:17:35 <ghostcat[m]> <crabman[m]1 "I don't use a password manager o"> Maybe you should start. It can make your life easier. Up to you in the end though.
15:19:04 <crabman[m]1> <SchismXL8 "Yes, as GrapheneOS uses Vanadium"> So vanadium does not save passwords?  And I assume if I made FF my default browser, Graphene would sill use Vanadium for wifi login?
15:19:20 <dazinism> alzxjm: note I said 'as you install an app'
15:20:22 <dazinism> You could uninstall an app then install again
15:21:00 <LinusArchTips[m]> <crabman[m]1 "I don't use a password manager o"> How do you remember everything lol
15:22:41 * SchismXL8 uploaded an image: 42f9152a-82e1-40e1-b92f-952f6edad7c0.png (92KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/twCXDffuNxeHpYxPWDAoLHyr >
15:23:03 <SchismXL8> crabman yes, it can save passwords!
15:23:19 <SchismXL8> I don't know if that applies to the WebView portion, though.
15:23:31 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Is there a reason I should use it over any password manager? Curious...
15:24:42 <crabman[m]1> <SchismXL8 "42f9152a-82e1-40e1-b92f-952f6eda"> Thanks, yes all is enabled.  Two sites are listed/saved, but not xfinity.
15:24:43 <dazinism> Guess its more integrated with browser/websites. But exploiting the browser gets all passwords held there
15:25:24 <dazinism> Having passwords in a separate password manager app avoids that.
15:25:54 <dazinism> Ideally the password manager needs a way to avoid leaking passwords via the clipboard
15:26:53 <alzxjm[m]> cdesai: What would the relevant lines be in `adb logcat`? I saved the output to a file.
15:30:41 <cryptoid> hello
15:30:48 <cryptoid> i cannot seem to download any releases
15:31:07 <cryptoid> seems like the server is down.. could anyone verify ?!
15:31:14 <cryptoid> thanks
15:31:47 <SchismXL8> crabman have you tried logging into xfinity through the Vanadium browser and not WebView? I'm purely speculating now.
15:32:39 <crabman[m]1> <SchismXL8 "crabman have you tried logging i"> Thanks, I will try that.
15:32:41 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <dazinism "Ideally the password manager nee"> And keepassDX handled it through a... keyboard
15:33:01 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Which is better than Bitwarden's nagging of accessibility services
15:33:05 <crabman[m]1> I see 2020.08.03.22 was released.  I go to "Check for updates" and nothing happens.  Will this update eventually come by OTA?  Or does it need to be sideloaded by PC.
15:33:06 <SchismXL8> Working for me, cryptoid.
15:33:29 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <crabman[m]1 "I see 2020.08.03.22 was released"> Only available in beta afaik
15:33:39 <cryptoid> how weird! i get 404 not found
15:33:40 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Check the update channel
15:34:14 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Check the release channel
15:35:21 <crabman[m]1> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "Only available in beta afaik"> So I will be able to update by OTA when available?
15:35:23 <cryptoid> https://releases.grapheneos.org/coral-factory-2020.06.22.21.zip is working?!
15:35:43 <SchismXL8> Nah, that isn't lol
15:35:50 <cryptoid> aha!
15:36:10 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It works on me
15:36:15 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Oh not that
15:36:17 <cryptoid> And here I am super excited to set up my pixel 4 xl
15:36:31 <cryptoid> dont wanna run the device with stock android not even for half a day XD
15:36:36 <za_warudo-vilfp8> I mean the latest one
15:36:46 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <crabman[m]1 "So I will be able to update by O"> Yeah
15:37:11 <SchismXL8> https://releases.grapheneos.org/coral-factory-2020.07.06.20.zip cryptoid is the current latest for the 4XL
15:37:40 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Yeah latest stable
15:37:49 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It works
15:38:15 <cryptoid> thank you ever so much!
15:39:25 <SchismXL8> cryptoid out of curiosity, how did you get that old download link?
15:47:26 <ghostcat[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "Which is better than Bitwarden's"> Another reason not to use Bitwarden.
16:09:10 <alzxjm[m]> So checking in about the Tor browser issue: on a fresh GrapheneOS Beta install, I get the same error that was previously reported.
16:09:18 <alzxjm[m]> - Unable to start Tor: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/data/app/org.torproject.torbrowser-UBsm_6TRDynSzo5gsX-Aow==/lib/arm64/libTor.so" (in directory "/data/user/0/org.torproject.torbrowser/app_torservice"): error=13, Permission denied
16:09:44 <alzxjm[m]> I downloaded the aarch64 version from the [Tor website](https://www.torproject.org/download/#android).
16:12:38 <alzxjm[m]> Same thing with Aurora install.
16:22:05 <alzxjm[m]> Actually I think a similar thing is at the root of the Syncthing failure:
16:22:06 <alzxjm[m]> ```
16:22:06 <alzxjm[m]> SyncthingRunnable: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/data/app/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid-uiKrls4eppHU_6NH5n9x_A==/lib/arm64/libsyncthing.so": error=13, Permission denied
16:22:06 <alzxjm[m]> ```
16:25:24 <alzxjm[m]> Yesterday strcat had said "apps aren't allowed to run executables from their data directory anymore as of Android 10 if they target Android 10+"
16:27:45 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: Is this Tor browser out of the box?
16:28:50 <alzxjm[m]> I tried every version: from Tor website, from Aurora, from F-Droid, and Tor Alpha from Guardian Project repo.
16:29:37 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: That isn't what I asked. I am asking is this Tor browser without any configurations?
16:30:06 <alzxjm[m]> Oh, sorry. Yes. No configurations or modifications. Install Tor, open, and hit connect.
16:31:54 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: You are good. ^^ I'll try to figure that out. Cause on mobile the Tor browser needs to be configured. More so with Orbot. I believe the Tor browser app did work at one point. I never used the Tor browser app before. Just used Orbot in the past.
16:39:29 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: Now just to be even more clear did you configure anything on the Orbot side? Cause this can also be an issue from time to time.
16:40:40 <alzxjm[m]> I don't have Orbot installed. My understanding is that Tor for Android is standalone.
16:42:53 <alzxjm[m]> I had this same version of Tor working on the latest CalyxOS just a few hours ago.
16:43:53 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: Did they make Tor browser standalone where you don't need Orbot?
16:44:41 <alzxjm[m]> ghostcat: I think so? I've never used Orbot.
16:45:17 <dazinism> Think tor browser never needed orbot?
16:46:18 <ghostcat[m]> Well I am so used to Orfox that is why I ask.
16:46:38 <ghostcat[m]> It worked for me in conjunction to using Orbot though.
16:48:56 <ghostcat[m]> Orbot is basically a proxy according to the Tor Project.
16:49:18 <ghostcat[m]> https://support.torproject.org/tormobile/
16:51:00 <dazinism> Yeah tor browser got its own tor process to make it easier for people to use
16:51:33 <ghostcat[m]> Well Tor browser I see is more sandboxed in by the looks of it.
16:56:18 <ghostcat[m]> Okay well this is very interesting. What I thought to be a proxy problem really it isn't.
16:56:55 <dmatrixs[m]> <alzxjm[m] "So checking in about the Tor bro"> Thank you so much for checking
16:56:58 <ghostcat[m]> I can't even replicate the problem. My Tor browser is working fine. I can connect to the Tor network without an issue on my end.
16:58:10 <dmatrixs[m]> <cryptoid "And here I am super excited to s"> Could you please let me know if you see the same error reported with Tor browser? I am on the same device
16:58:17 <ghostcat[m]> I am going to check the issues tracker so I don't get anyone's hopes up though.
16:59:44 <dmatrixs[m]> Thanks. I'm really not sure if device matters here but I'm on pixel 4xl
17:00:36 <dazinism> The Guardian project devs are active at #guardianproject:matrix.org
17:00:38 <ghostcat[m]> dmatrixs: I think it does cause I am on Pixel 3a XL and it works fine on Pixel 3a.
17:01:06 <alzxjm[m]> dmatrixs: yeah Pixel 4 XL
17:01:12 <dazinism> Should be able to advise on orbot issues
17:01:14 <dmatrixs[m]> <dazinism "The Guardian project devs are ac"> Oo good call
17:01:55 <alzxjm[m]> And the exact same version worked on current CalyxOS so it seems specific to the Graphene/P4XL combo.
17:02:07 <alzxjm[m]> I.e. Calyx/P4XL worked fine.
17:02:44 <dmatrixs[m]> never lucky
17:06:06 <ghostcat[m]> alzxjm: Did you try it using a default proxy?
17:06:35 <dmatrixs[m]> If Tor is working fine on other pixels would that not imply that a problem somewhere within GrapheneOS?
17:07:36 <crabman[m]1> Is there a recommended TTS solution for Graphene?  I seen Flite being recommended, but I don‚Äôt believe Flite is being supported any longer.  I have seen Google TTS with internet access blocked being used, but that seems a little sketchy.  Are there other alternatives?
17:12:19 <ghostcat[m]> dmatrixs: Well a problem with the current build on Pixel 4.
17:14:27 <dazinism> Yeah tor browser and orbot work fine for me on 3XL and GrapheneOS
17:15:03 <dmatrixs[m]> Roger that
17:15:28 <dazinism> Think there is an issue with some current releases of orbot, but uninstalling and reinstalling will maybe fix that?
17:17:05 <czrrrr> Big explosion https://clipwatching.com/9q8hnqi42wjv/explosison_fishing.mp4.html
17:18:27 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: Issue being?
17:19:25 <dazinism> That a bit randomly on some peoples devices it doesn't work
17:19:42 <dazinism> Theres a recent release that fixes this
17:19:47 <dazinism> https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases/tag/16.3.1-BETA-1-tor-0.4.2.7
17:19:48 <dmatrixs[m]> <dazinism "Think there is an issue with som"> Been there done that man
17:20:15 <dazinism> Not sure if its available from fdroid, Play etc. yet?
17:21:28 <dazinism> czrrrr: why the offtopic posts? Are you a bot?
17:26:26 <SchismXL8> <crabman[m]1 "Is there a recommended TTS solut"> Nah, there isn't.
17:29:03 <ghostcat[m]> <dazinism "That a bit randomly on some peop"> So Orbot shuts off randomly.
17:29:05 <crabman[m]1> <SchismXL8 "Nah, there isn't. "> Schism: thanks for the reply
17:29:50 <dazinism> ghostcat: no it just doesn't work at all after the update
17:30:44 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: Well my device is working fine.
17:31:22 <dazinism> But its not like every Samsung S10 (or whatever phone) just randomly for some
17:32:35 <dazinism> Think the version I just linked fixes the issue
17:35:06 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: Yeah well I am not saying it isn't an issue.
17:37:54 <dazinism> If I'm not confused it may also have been connected to which architecture version the apk was used for the update also (the universal one being OK)
17:38:29 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: That is interesting.
17:38:44 <dazinism> I caught some chat before I applied the update a couple of months back and used that and have also been fine
17:44:03 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: Has this issue happened on the Pixels at all?
17:46:32 <dazinism> I think it was possibly on any phone? Not sure.... Also think its fixed in the release linked above
17:50:05 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: I don't think with any phone though.
17:50:55 <ghostcat[m]> For short term usage I have yet to have a problem.
17:51:52 <dazinism> It was an issue where the last update (in May) broke the app for some people
17:52:20 <dazinism> If it didnt break when you updated, then you wouldnt see a problem
17:52:55 <dazinism> Also I guess would randomly break for some people if they did a fresh install of that version.
17:53:26 <nikitalita[m]> just curious, is there an example of a serious android exploit released into the wild that GrapheneOS already mitigated due to hardening?
17:53:44 <ghostcat[m]> dazinism: Oh in May that makes more sense. Thanks for clarifying.
17:53:48 <dazinism> Like it would never work for them, but if it worked when first installed would be fine
17:54:10 <ghostcat[m]> I didn't use it in May so I wouldn't know.
17:54:24 <ghostcat[m]> This is my first time using it.
18:23:01 <aeonsolution[m]> nikitalita: i encourage you to check out <https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bj1gpz/syzbot_and_the_tale_of_thousand_kernel_bugs/> and <https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/38158.html>
18:23:22 <aeonsolution[m]> learn about kernel vulnerabilities and user space vulnerabilities
18:26:04 <aeonsolution[m]> Once you sort of understand the different then you can asking the question but with a specific target goal in mind. GrapheneOS adds patches ontop of AOSP to hardened the operating system. GrapheneOS also comes security focused applications as well like Vanadium (that includes both a browser and a webview).
18:26:29 <aeonsolution[m]>  * [correction] Once you sort of understand the different then you can try asking the question but with a specific target goal in mind. GrapheneOS adds patches ontop of AOSP to hardened the operating system. GrapheneOS also comes security focused applications as well like Vanadium (that includes both a browser and a webview).
18:27:37 <aeonsolution[m]> There is a lot more security baked into the OS that I can't really elaborate on because I'm still learning but this is a good place to start.
18:31:35 <ss604[m]> I an using the pixel 3 with grapheneos and the app Jami is not operating correctly. Is anyone else having or had this issue ?
18:32:15 <refragable[m]> <brockin042[m] "I don't see it in the install in"> Yes, you can boot into recovery mode and side load the OTA
18:32:15 <alzxjm[m]> ss604: Lemme try and install it.
18:32:31 <alzxjm[m]> ss604: Where does the app fail for you?
18:33:02 <alzxjm[m]> ss604: I was able to install it and setup an account.
18:33:55 <ss604[m]> Receiving messages I setup a desktop account as well to test and I can send to my desktop but not receive from it
18:34:43 <ss604[m]> I have enabled jami to run in background but that did not change anything
18:36:33 <alzxjm[m]> Did you install from F-Droid or Aurora?
18:36:44 <ss604[m]> F droid
18:37:17 <nikitalita[m]> aeonsolution: I was thinking from more of a promotional standpoint; like, "hey, remember that giant android bug? grapheneos wasn't vulnerable to that"
18:38:16 <nikitalita[m]> hmm
18:38:20 <nikitalita[m]> netsplit?

19:38:13 <ThomCat[m]> brockin042 can you switch between T-Mobile/Sprint/US Cellular though?
19:38:14 <erhcetua[m]> reddit spreads misinformation
19:40:24 <ThomCat[m]> If another chat mod is needed, I will volunteer
19:41:50 <ThomCat[m]> Ahh gotcha.  I'm not on Fi anymore, but where I am in southwest Wisconsin is a heavy US Cellular area, but T-Mobile is getting better
19:45:44 <ThomCat[m]> There's a couple of those
19:45:56 <cn3m[m]> BillTheBloke: sorry bill there is no mod on right now
19:46:01 <ghostcat[m]> Copperhead users are very immature. Thinking they are doing something for a cause.
19:46:02 <ThomCat[m]> What I want to know is, does tower switching work at all on Graphene
19:46:10 <cn3m[m]> please ignore the trolll

19:48:45 <rawgadgetry[m]> How could I increase my chance of success for installing Grapene on a 3aXL? Please forgive me if this has been asked before. I made a post on Reddit asking this with more detail, but it was flagged as spam for some reason so it was taken down. Long story short, I failed one time and I really cant fail again. I don't specifically know why it failed.
19:50:05 <cn3m[m]> <rawgadgetry[m] "How could I increase my chance o"> ask about your issue here
19:50:38 <BalooRJ> rawgadgetry: What desktop OS are you using to install GrapheneOS
19:51:01 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: I'm on Google Fi. Please feel free to ask questions!
19:51:35 <rawgadgetry[m]> BalooRJ: I originally used windows 10. but I use Linux enough to try it.
19:52:18 <BalooRJ> did your last failed try come from linux or windows 10
19:52:34 <rawgadgetry[m]> Win 10
19:53:12 <ThomCat[m]> prion_disease why won't you accept my chat invite?
19:54:12 <BalooRJ> https://invidio.us/watch?v=gQkb0OAOXoc - Try this guide rawgadgetry
19:54:52 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: Yeah sorry about the ping. I misread the Fi comments as I was trying to ignore the troll. Question, though. Have you managed to get MMS working?
19:54:53 <alzxjm[m]> It's the only thing that doesn't work on Fi for me.
19:55:18 <alzxjm[m]> Well, that and voicemail transcriptions I guess.
19:55:28 <alzxjm[m]> But that doesn't matter as much.
19:56:15 <rawgadgetry[m]> BalooRJ: I watched Techlore's video. On my Reddit post, before it was taken down, somebody replied telling me to come here and that his video does some things wrong. I watched his video and referenced the official instructions to do my installation.
19:56:41 <Kurai> no please follow the official guide, don' watch videos from random people
19:56:50 <Kurai> https://grapheneos.org/install
19:57:17 <rawgadgetry[m]> I did though. But I used his video as a guide.
19:58:30 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: SMS works fine for me, but not MMS. Can you text images to people?
19:58:36 <rawgadgetry[m]> Kurai: I ran into issues like the cmd installer telling me it was out of date.
19:58:43 <alzxjm[m]> Or receive text images?
19:59:22 <LinusArchTips[m]> https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg this video is the one people have luck with, just he skips the verification
20:00:06 <Kurai> rawgadgetry[m] start from scratch following only official guide and if you have any problem, ask here
20:02:13 <LinusArchTips[m]>  * https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg this video is the one people have luck with, the only think is, he skips the verification

20:03:08 <rawgadgetry[m]> Kurai: I started from scratch several times on my last GP and I think I ended up bricking it. Not even the official OEM installer restored it. I have a new one and it's all updated and ready for me to start. I'm trying to gather any useful info before I start my 2nd attempt. I will be following the official instructions to a T this time.
20:08:20 <alzxjm[m]> brockin042: Huh. Well if you manage to receive MMS messages definitely let me know!
20:24:45 <dmatrixs[m]> prion_disease: die please
20:25:42 <rawgadgetry[m]> HeadDweller: Really??? I will defiantly keep that in mind. Because that's exactly what I used.
20:27:47 <overheadscallop[> dmatrixs: Just ignore him until a mod kick/bans. `/ignore @prion_disease:matrix.org` on Matrix/Element or `/ignore prion_disease[m]` for IRC people.
20:30:59 <dmatrixs[m]> I just did and I assume everyone else did too given relative lack of reactions

20:32:59 <YumekoJabamiIRL[> That was some extremely low quality shit posting on prions part
20:34:21 <alzxjm[m]> I installed a Beta Channel release and when I go into Settings > System > System update settings I'm on the Stable release channel. Two questions:

20:38:21 <alzxjm[m]> I.e. `releases#coral-beta`
20:38:44 <refragable[m]> then you're running the beta version

21:30:42 <Joeri[m]> wow, this seems targeted at this point
21:30:49 <strcat> it is

21:40:51 <Forbo[m]> Glad I joined the channel before it got made invite only. Man, what a dumpster fire. Sorry y'all are having to deal with a bunch of trolls.
21:41:03 <strcat> it's a coordinated attack on the project by Copperhead
21:41:16 <strcat> part of the other harassment of contributors to the project and their misinformation campaign
21:41:27 <strcat> along with all the other ways they are trying to harm the developers and project

21:46:53 <wreck[m]> https://grapheneos.org/#history
21:46:54 <strcat> Copperhead is the former sponsor of this open source project, they attempted a takeover of the project via coercion
21:47:06 <strcat> and now they do whatever they can to cause harm to it while also leeching off the work being done
21:47:44 <strcat[m]> the wikipedia page was written by the CEO and a couple of his friends
21:48:01 <rawgadgetry[m]> Well, good to know. Thank you strcat:
21:48:20 <strcat[m]> all going to be dealt with and his ultimate destination is jail for fraud and theft
21:50:26 <strcat[m]> doesn't matter, we know he's in here coordinating attacks on the project
21:50:58 <strcat[m]> seems the racist / gore spam stopped now that he realizes it will make him look bad

22:46:58 <strcat[m]> that's how he spends his time
22:47:33 <strcat[m]> getting people to come post gore and racist messages in our channel is par for the course
22:47:49 <strcat[m]> he's done far more underhanded and unethical things than that
22:48:00 <strcat[m]> barely even registers as an event with everything else he's up to
22:48:37 <strcat[m]> he's probably pretty mad that Android Headlines took down that inaccurate article based on misinformation from him
22:49:11 <barstool[m]> What a lame! Well if he wants to swing on your balls for the rest of his life instead of moving on. What a waste of his time
22:49:49 <strcat[m]> I still own half of Copperhead too - half the voting shares
22:49:53 <strcat[m]> not really sure what he hopes to accomplish
22:50:08 <strcat[m]> ultimately he'll just be removed as director and the fraud, theft, etc. will catch up to him
22:50:17 <strcat[m]> I'm far from the only person he has scammed and screwed over
22:50:58 <strcat[m]> it's not his company, it's still our company, he just treats it as his personal weapon to cause harm to me

22:52:27 <pyxel3aXL[m]> What a jack arse
23:14:58 <unknown01234[m]> Was there an update just now?
23:15:44 <pyxel3aXL[m]> There's this months security patch yes
23:21:15 <nikitalita[m]> are there any mirrors for the releases? My download is dog slow right now for some reason
23:22:10 <renlord> strcat[m]:
23:22:25 <renlord> booting took longer than usual
23:23:35 <renlord> with this new update
23:27:56 <nikitalita[m]> is everyone else getting slow downloads from the releases?
23:28:37 <nikitalita[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases
23:29:29 <renlord> no, very fast for me
23:29:38 <nikitalita[m]> hmmmmm
23:29:44 <renlord> but the seamless update client crashed again
23:30:02 <renlord> had to manually reboot
23:31:42 <nikitalita[m]> would bittorrent mirrors be a bad idea from a security standpoint?
23:32:15 <pixelusu> yea i get slow download i tried right now and it download at only 180Kb
23:32:35 <renlord> ota update payloads are not even that large
23:32:48 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, but im downloading the entire image for a new phone
23:32:56 <pixelusu> *KB
23:33:17 <renlord> maybe there's a good case to be made for full release
23:33:23 <renlord> but for ota updates, no
23:33:34 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, for the full releases
23:33:43 <nickcalyx[m]> <nikitalita[m] "would bittorrent mirrors be a ba"> I think it would be.good
23:33:54 <renlord> alternatively, just hosting on a mirror is just good enough
23:34:03 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, are there any mirrors?
23:34:08 <renlord> no
23:34:14 <nikitalita[m]> welp
23:34:36 <nickcalyx[m]> With bittorrent there is at least checksumming in the protocol
23:34:45 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, but what do they use?
23:35:01 <renlord> the checksum dont check authenticity though
23:35:05 <nickcalyx[m]> And it saves on bandwidth and gives faster download speeds
23:35:08 <renlord> just checks file integrity
23:35:38 <nikitalita[m]> ah, uses sha-1
23:35:40 <nikitalita[m]> bogus
23:36:30 <nikitalita[m]> well, the instructions already state that you should verify the signature of the download before installation
23:37:12 <renlord> how many people actually follow instructions verbatim?
23:37:58 <nikitalita[m]> im gonna hop on a vpn briefly to test this
23:38:11 <cn3m[m]> <renlord "how many people actually follow "> I did :)
23:38:18 <cn3m[m]> for the install if that is what you are talking about
23:38:23 <cn3m[m]> zero issues
23:38:56 <renlord> yeah, but based on my experience here, i dont think many people actually follow the instructions verbatim based on the questions they ask
23:39:07 <nikitalita[m]> apparently bittorrentv2 uses sha256 for checksumming
23:39:20 <nikitalita[m]> but i dont think many clients actually support it
23:39:34 <cdesai> iirc CM tried bittorrent
23:39:54 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, transmission doesn't
23:40:56 <nikitalita[m]> libtorrent and qbittorrent does
23:41:06 <nikitalita[m]> that's acceptable
23:41:27 <nikitalita[m]> if we can create v2 only bittorrent files
23:42:44 * JTL seeds cdesai'
23:42:52 <JTL> I meant your torrents bud
23:42:55 <JTL> lol
23:42:59 <JTL> Oops
23:43:13 <JTL> Whoops
23:43:14 <refragable[m]> Vicarious: Here's what Daniel said about "official" install guide videos https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200623#c4197051
23:43:42 <JTL> refragable[m]: I think certain people making install guide videos mean well, but I agree with his concerns
23:45:24 <dmatrixs[m]> <strcat[m] "I still own half of Copperhead t"> Wait are you THE  Daniel Micay ?
23:45:38 <refragable[m]> Yes that is Daniel
23:45:54 <dmatrixs[m]> Wowowow.
23:50:02 <nikitalita[m]> are all these trolls from the copperhead community?
23:50:05 <nikitalita[m]> wow
23:50:11 <nikitalita[m]> the fuck is their deal
23:50:43 <refragable[m]> Vicarious: The requirements for an "officially recommended" video playlist were laid out pretty clearly. The tutorial should be split into multiple parts so that it's easier to change when instructions need updates.
23:51:15 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: James lies to them and gets them to come harass people here and post racist / disturbing messages and images
23:51:24 <nikitalita[m]> welp
23:51:43 <strcat[m]> he admitted it in a private message to cn3m
23:54:44 <nikitalita[m]> ugh
23:54:49 <nikitalita[m]> i'm sorry you have to put up with that
23:57:30 <strcat[m]> probably need to add more moderators here if they're going to keep doing that because I don't intend to keep the channel invite only
23:58:54 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
