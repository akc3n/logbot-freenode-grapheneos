01:13:22 <dq[m]> ?
01:14:29 <dq[m]> Its on Pixel 3
01:26:32 <dq[m]> <dq[m] "Screenshot_20200622-111220.png"> Problem Solved by disabling default camera app and installing open camera from F-droid.
01:35:29 <strcat[m]> dq: try a reboot
01:35:43 <strcat[m]> doubt the issue is the camera app
02:59:18 <defconanon12[m]> I don't want to post this in GitHub cause I just don't know if this is a true issue. I am having a problem of using VoLTE. Calls don't go through and texting doesn't go through. This is only when I am LTE only mode. The workaround is being on LTE recommend. I tried the default texting app and Signal. Didn't work for either.

05:31:41 <treiz[m]> is there a way to import contacts into the default contacts app?
05:32:56 <renlord> strcat[m]: do you have issues where outlook-protection blocked your MTA?
05:33:26 <renlord> or at least mark mail from your MTA as spam
05:56:23 <TheJollyRoger> treiz[m]: yes! Look under settings, Import and you should be able to load a .vcf file.
06:01:32 <treiz[m]> got it, I had a csv
06:13:49 <strcat[m]> renlord: dunno
06:13:51 <strcat[m]> don't check
06:13:55 <strcat[m]> haven't been sending mail recently
07:43:03 <jacob[m]> Hello everyone!
07:43:51 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy!
08:43:44 <fujita_[m]> Yo Ho Ho!
09:16:37 <privacy_based_li> Hi guys!
09:17:45 <privacy_based_li> Does anyone know about the new S3K250AF-based "Secure Element" security chip?
09:21:17 <privacy_based_li> Samsung is not letting me visit this site on tor so have a look https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/newsroom/news-events/best-in-class-data-security-chip-solution-for-mobile/
09:27:41 <privacy_based_li> https://9to5google.com/2020/05/26/samsung-galaxy-s20-secure-element-chip/
09:29:29 <privacy_based_li> Interesting but I guess it lagged a bit behind in comparison to Titan
09:30:56 <jalb66> privacy_based_li, interesting
09:34:36 <privacy_based_li> It says
09:34:36 <privacy_based_li> > "Samsung also explains that this new chip has twice as much storage onboard for storing secure information and also allows for ‚Äúhardware-based root of trust (RoT), secure boot, and device authentication.‚Äù
09:34:36 <privacy_based_li>  So I guess the next gen will be comparable to Titan?
09:52:21 <gozimas[m]> <privacy_based_li "Samsung is not letting me visit "> Then close Tor and check it in a normal browser.. Gosh
09:53:52 <gozimas[m]> This isn't r/privacy. We need privacy against oppressive governments so people can freely share thoughts and such. Not for checking Samsungs website.
10:49:47 <privacy_based_li> I use tor as my only browser, whats wrong with that
10:50:39 <madaidan[m]> <privacy_based_li "Samsung is not letting me visit "> Use archive.org as a proxy
10:50:50 <madaidan[m]> I use it all the time to bypass sites blocking Tor
10:51:15 <privacy_based_li> Nice idea, Thanks!
10:52:28 <jalb66> madaidan[m], where is the proxy in the webpage?
10:54:22 <privacy_based_li> madaidan meant use it like a proxy
10:54:45 <jalb66> How?
10:55:16 <privacy_based_li> https://web.archive.org/web/20200622101055/https://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/newsroom/news-events/best-in-class-data-security-chip-solution-for-mobile/
10:55:23 <privacy_based_li> like this
10:55:53 <privacy_based_li> accessing the website snapshot through archive
10:56:34 <jalb66> Adding the website then?
10:56:48 <jalb66> Not all the websites are added
10:57:36 <privacy_based_li> true
10:58:05 <jalb66> What link did you add?
10:58:11 <privacy_based_li> try it, most are i guess
10:58:42 <privacy_based_li> <jalb66 "What link did you add?"> where
10:58:59 <jalb66> When you post your link
10:59:08 <jalb66> It's not working for me
10:59:44 <privacy_based_li> just paste the link in the textbox
11:01:59 <jalb66> Ah ok, I get it
11:02:05 <jalb66> It was not working before, sorry
11:06:25 <furofuro_01[m]> Sorry if I'll ask here again, kinda off topic, but is there any "secure" smart TVs that doesn't phone home at all?
11:06:39 <furofuro_01[m]> Or at least has mininal of that stuffs

11:08:08 <furofuro_01[m]> * .
12:37:52 <hypokeimenon[m]> Wait, Copperhead had partnerships with Wired and Tutanota?
12:37:56 <hypokeimenon[m]> How?
12:47:52 <jalb66> Where did you read that?√ß

12:59:51 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Have you guys seen the new covid tracking built into Google play services?
13:00:25 <j3ghprjfo[m]> I have a separate work phone and this appeared in the settings
13:00:26 * j3ghprjfo[m] uploaded an image: jpeg_1592830521000.jpg (150KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ORKGwqaKgpIaAcbSujDbsGEh >
13:01:46 <turtle-21[m]> Saw it on a friend's Android device. Unsettling, IMO
13:02:55 <jalb66> j3ghprjfo[m], it's only an api to prepare for the app, that's why you use Google Services
13:05:01 <jalb66> j3ghprjfo[m], it's only an api to prepare for the app, that's because you use Google Services
13:09:25 <j3ghprjfo[m]> It is a little unsettling, I know Google has always collected and sold your info but they're throwing it in your face now
13:10:23 <jalb66> It's not the app. If you're in Europe you must consent to enable Bluetooth and install the app
13:10:27 <jalb66> IDN in other countries
13:10:39 <jalb66> Few countries have the app now
13:10:40 <alzxjm[m]1> I dunno. Seems they're very transparent about what they collect. myactivity.google.com
13:11:15 <jalb66> SO, Apple and Google prepare their phones in the case you want to install the app when it somes
13:11:21 <jalb66> SO, Apple and Google prepare their phones in the case you want to install the app when it comes
13:12:26 <jalb66> That's what you see. If you don't want to see it then don't accept Google services or change to GrapheneOS üòÄ
13:14:21 <r4v3r23[m]> how intrustive is an app like whatsapp?
13:14:27 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Unfortunately for me I have a work phone that can't be modified in any way, so I have a dummy Google account it with as much settings turned off as possible
13:14:36 <jalb66> r4v3r23[m], very
13:14:54 <r4v3r23[m]> ive got a fully open source set up, wondering how introducing a closed source like whatsapp could fuck things up
13:15:03 <r4v3r23[m]> jalb66: explain
13:15:22 <jalb66> Is it necessary to explain what Facebook does?
13:15:35 <jalb66> Search and see
13:15:37 <r4v3r23[m]> im talking about the app itself
13:16:35 <r4v3r23[m]> ill wait for a real answer from some one
13:16:50 <jalb66> Many weird vulnerabilites found these past months... and they collect metadata and you use Facebokook servers when you call
13:17:01 <jalb66> Maybe they are encrypted but I don't trust them, sorry
13:17:15 <r4v3r23[m]> i know the issues with the service
13:17:22 <jalb66> All about Facebook is like shit to me
13:17:30 <jalb66> Can't be trusted
13:17:34 <r4v3r23[m]> want to knoe if that can some how affect the rest of the system
13:17:48 <jalb66> And you need Google services to use it
13:17:56 <r4v3r23[m]> whatsapp runs on graphene
13:18:09 <jalb66> r4v3r23[m], really?, even push?
13:18:17 <r4v3r23[m]> the app works
13:18:25 <r4v3r23[m]> calls/messages etc
13:18:31 <jalb66> Or only manually?, I read here some people complaining it didn't work
13:18:55 <jalb66> Using GOS and then Google services and Whatsapp... I don't understant
13:19:10 <jalb66> Why not Android One then or Pixel default android?
13:19:11 <r4v3r23[m]> no one said google services
13:19:15 <r4v3r23[m]> jesus
13:19:27 <jalb66> Ah yes, you use without that
13:19:33 <jalb66> Ah yes, you use it without that
13:19:42 <jalb66> If you are confortable using it then use it
13:20:01 <r4v3r23[m]> im not but wanted to see if its "safe"
13:20:16 <r4v3r23[m]> i know the app itself isnt private i can handle that
13:20:19 <jalb66> Well, check the permissions and what can do with all your profile
13:20:28 <r4v3r23[m]> idk how sandboxing etc works
13:20:41 <jalb66> I don't use it, I can't tell exactly about it
13:20:47 <jalb66> I used it some time ago
13:21:04 <jalb66> r4v3r23[m], apps can communicate each other in each profile
13:22:00 <jalb66> So Whatsapp can see all you see when you use the Files app
13:22:12 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Whatsapp probably won't "fuck things up" and probably has pretty good security built into the app, but from a privacy stand point it goes against what GOS is. You can deny it permissions like storage, sensors phone and location and it should still work
13:23:15 <r4v3r23[m]> j3ghprjfo: yeah as long it work affect the rest of my set up and any anti-privacy issues are sandboxed strictly in-app i can live with that
13:23:33 <r4v3r23[m]>  * j3ghprjfo: yeah as long it wont affect the rest of my set up and any anti-privacy issues are sandboxed strictly in-app i can live with that
13:23:57 <jalb66> You could use it only in another profile but it must be hard
13:24:30 <r4v3r23[m]> if its a "backdoor" to the rest of my device then fuck that
13:24:31 <j3ghprjfo[m]> I would recommend setting up another profile for it, or even a work profile if you want notifications coming through
13:24:54 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Look into Shelter on fdroid
13:26:51 <r4v3r23[m]> maybe strcat can chime in
13:27:28 <Arhu> Whatsapp probably does what it says and keeps the contents of your messages private, but collects metadata
13:27:36 <jalb66> strcat[m] already explained here about what apps do in the same profile
13:27:41 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Not to speak for him but, he'll say something along the lines of, don't use it, if you must use it in a separate profile
13:27:48 <r4v3r23[m]> gotchya
13:28:23 <blacklight447[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "Wait, Copperhead had partnership"> Copperhead already deleted their blog, tutanota allowed them to use their logo on the website because they preinstall it, i got them to remove it
13:28:23 <blacklight447[m]> <jalb66 "Where did you read that?"> In my mail box
13:29:08 <blacklight447[m]> I reached out to tutanota
13:29:09 <jalb66> blacklight447[m], now or some time ago?
13:29:21 <blacklight447[m]> As a member of ptio, i got some strings to pull
13:29:34 <blacklight447[m]> <jalb66 "blacklight447, now or some time "> About an hour ago
13:29:49 <jalb66> :-o
13:33:23 <interceptingfist> I like tutanota, wish they'd make a simple domain name so I wouldn't have to spell it for everyone
13:35:06 <brenneke[m]> <interceptingfist "I like tutanota, wish they'd mak"> How about their tuta domain?
13:35:07 <brenneke[m]> tuta.io
13:36:31 <brenneke[m]> Tutanota has been promising offline access to email but still don't have it.....is why I use Posteo instead. Has been flawless for over a year for me.
13:41:50 <frenchieisverige> <j3ghprjfo[m] "I would recommend setting up ano"> I have this setup (WhatsApp in a work profile via shelter) and notifications are rarely working. I need to manually check if there are some new messages. Running on lineage OS though.
13:51:23 <greenmoon[m]> I have same setup and no problem with notification
13:51:42 <greenmoon[m]> Its working very well
13:51:55 <greenmoon[m]> * I have same setup and no problem with notifications
13:53:06 <greenmoon[m]> There must be something wrong in your setup
13:55:24 <cx2[m]> Lineage could be breaking something....not uncommon
13:55:46 <greenmoon[m]> I'm using lineageos
13:58:09 <greenmoon[m]> Without gapps or microg
13:58:18 <privacy_based_li> <blacklight447[m] "Tutanota just said they asked co"> Great!
13:59:24 <cx2[m]> blacklight447: nice work!
14:26:22 <frenchieisverige> <cx2[m] "Lineage could be breaking someth"> Maybe. But i'm planning to switch to grapheneos as soon as I financially can
14:27:04 <frenchieisverige> <greenmoon[m] "I'm using lineageos"> Me too. But using microg services.
14:32:03 <greenmoon[m]> I don't even have notifications problem without microg and you have problems with microg? Something is not right
14:32:12 <cx2[m]> Separate user profiles are generally recommended here over apps like Islands or Shelter.
14:32:38 <greenmoon[m]> Lol I'm not going to switch profiles to use whatapps
14:32:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Btw is it just me or Bluetooth latency is just bad?
14:40:50 <cx2[m]> <greenmoon[m] "Lol I'm not going to switch prof"> No one is telling you to do anything. It's a matter of whether giving a app privileges that would otherwise be denied (for good reason) , vs convenience is worth it to you specifically.
14:40:55 <gozimas[m]> <greenmoon[m] "Lol I'm not going to switch prof"> Nobody is forcing you. He said it was recommended to not use apps like Shelter.
14:41:59 <xabi[m]> <greenmoon[m] "Lol I'm not going to switch prof"> That's  a plus, WhatsApp is not started if you don't open your profile
14:46:06 <cx2[m]> anupritaisno1: glassrom up on op7tpro5g?
14:54:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> "cx2" (https://matrix.to/#/@cx2:matrix.org): no
14:54:58 <cx2[m]> Rats.
14:56:09 <turtle-21[m]> Have any of you currently on GOS had a problem with any apps that don't have dependencies on Google not behaving well?
14:58:04 <jalb66> turtle-21[m], I haven't, until now
14:58:37 <jalb66> turtle-21[m], I haven't
15:01:49 <hapssmak[m]> Is iPhone still recommended over GrapheneOS?
15:02:04 <hapssmak[m]> What are the advantages of both?
15:02:08 <proof_jr> <turtle-21[m] "Have any of you currently on GOS"> signal downloaded from their website requires restart after updates to send out texts
15:06:43 <j3ghprjfo[m]> anupritaisno1: is there a build of glassrom for pixel 3?
15:07:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> j3ghprjfo: no
15:11:47 <jcpicard32[m]> hapssmak: They're quite comparable. At this point GrapheneOS is better at a lot of thigns, but iOS has a few notable advantages. See https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa/ and https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/gq8qk9/ios_or_grapheneos_which_is_further_along_with/
15:12:22 <turtle-21[m]> Gotcha. I'm having a problem with an app I need that worked fine on lineage and other ROMs without gapps. Worked on CalyxOS too. Contacted the company that makes the app and they're baffled, too. Any suggestions?
15:13:13 <jcpicard32[m]> What app is it, and what did you do to produce the problem? I can try to help troubleshoot
15:26:38 <jalb66> madaidan[m], what do you think about this article from Micah Lee (I think you work in Whonix)?: https://micahflee.com/2020/06/is-the-whonix-project-run-by-fascists/
15:27:27 <jalb66> Have you seen something like this?
15:28:10 <turtle-21[m]> jcpicard32: it is the P3 mobile app. It is an app for Deaf people to call hearing people through video relay (sign language interpreters). When I sign in, the app appears to crash but is really still running in the background. It won't let me make calls and doesn't say I'm connected, though
15:28:25 <turtle-21[m]> I appreciate anything you can do!
15:29:05 <jcpicard32[m]> Sure thing. I'll take a look rn and see what I can find
15:30:00 <turtle-21[m]> Let me know if any more info would be helpful
15:41:10 <cn3m[m]> <jalb66 "madaidan., what do you think abo"> I just read that.. What?
15:41:20 <jalb66> WEird
15:43:11 <jcpicard32[m]> turtle-21: So I just tried installing it on my Phone to see if it would run at all. I was able to get to the login screen, but didn't test past that. According to Aurora Store it is GSF dependent. This could mean a few things. The best case would be that it only depends on this for notifications. In this case everything else would work. I don't think there is a hard dependency, however, because usually the app won't
15:43:11 <jcpicard32[m]> run at all, or will immediately fail if that happens.
15:43:17 <jcpicard32[m]> Have you tried reinstalling the app?
15:43:24 <jalb66> cn3m[m], but he gives good reasons
15:43:53 <turtle-21[m]> > Have you tried reinstalling the app?
15:43:53 <turtle-21[m]> Yes, tried twice
15:44:39 <jcpicard32[m]> Hmm. Okay. And you crashed before the login both times?
15:46:26 <turtle-21[m]> Right after login. But it isn't a true crash. It just relegates the app to the background but can be opened from there. Status always shows disconnected, though
15:47:12 <turtle-21[m]> I'm heading into work so forgive me for slow responses please, and thanks for trying to help!
15:47:48 <jcpicard32[m]> No worries. I'll say the same to you. I'm doing this as I take a break from my own work. I also don't want to clog up the chat too much more, but feel free to DM me if you want to keep talking about this!
15:57:01 <madaidan[m]> <jalb66 "madaidan., what do you think abo"> It's slander.
15:58:29 <jalb66> madaidan[m], ok, thanks. It seems weird whonix being in Gab
15:58:51 <madaidan[m]> The Jacob Appelbaum thing wasn't by an actual developer. Whonix has tons of social media accounts. Calling us fascists because there is an account on Gab is equivalent to saying we hate privacy because there is an account on Facebook. It's ridiculous.
15:58:53 <jalb66> But I know Gab is not only to those people
15:59:22 <jalb66> Yes, I know. In Gab there a lot of different people, it's only the fame
16:00:06 <jalb66> Being in Mastodon I know many people consider GAb as fascists, but I know there are more different people there
16:00:20 <jalb66> No only fascists
16:00:29 <jalb66> Well, you can answer him if you want
16:01:12 <jalb66> IT's true that GAb is full of fascists anyway, but not all
16:01:28 <jalb66> So, not true
16:01:58 <jalb66> Maybe Whonix should have choosen a different instance
16:04:58 <rosarium[m]> Yeah... still, it would be reasonable to respond at least with a quick message that "yes, Gab is known for fascist users, but no, Whonix is not one of them". Being silent about this is just going to create unnecessary conspiracies and uproar :/
16:15:16 <jalb66> Yeah
16:17:13 <defconanon12[m]> anupritaisno1: If your media is not playing properly my advice to you is toggle on Disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload in developer settings.
16:18:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> "defconanon12" (https://matrix.to/#/@defconanon12:matrix.org): I'm not on a pixel
16:19:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> Disabling offload causes any app that sends media over Bluetooth to crash
16:19:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's just that there's like a 1s latency
16:19:58 <defconanon12[m]> Oh I see.
16:20:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> And it gets pretty annoying ex. if you watch games on YouTube the jumpscare can be seen and the voice comes like 1s later
16:20:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> That can really.ruin things for you
16:23:35 <igioo[m]> @madaidan.:matrix.org: I don't know if that's the most fair comparison. Facebook isn't built around organizing users who are anti-privacy
16:24:47 <madaidan[m]> <igioo[m] "@madaidan.:matrix.org: I don't k"> Gab isn't built around organizing fascists. It just has a large fascist userbase.
16:32:41 <strcat[m]> gab itself is at most supportive of donald trump / republicans
16:33:17 <strcat[m]> they made it because of their perceived bias of Twitter towards them
16:33:27 <strcat[m]> it's appealing to the more extreme people associated with that too
16:33:50 <strcat[m]> it's not specific to that though
16:35:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): honestly such accusations happen far too often
16:36:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> * "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): madaidan.  honestly such accusations happen far too often
16:36:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> *  "madaidan." (https://matrix.to/#/@madaidan.:matrix.org)  honestly such accusations happen far too often
16:37:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you can ignore them just do
16:37:48 <madaidan[m]> Hard to ignore them when really popular people like Micah Lee are throwing them around.

16:50:26 <hypokeimenon[m]> <LynnStephenson[4 "I'm not sure if I would call it "> It's easy to say people are stupid from a position of less ignorance / comparatively higher education..
16:50:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> "Lynn Stephenson" (https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com): obviously people are offended for the wrong reasons here

17:06:16 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Do you guys recommend turning on sim lock? What would the draw backs be?
17:06:19 <defconanon12[m]> Lol just a lot of misinformation going around and some of the people fall for it. They are sheep in some ways of not doing research beforehand. It is like who has time for that? *says that while holding a phone in their hand*
17:06:31 <j3ghprjfo[m]> Also can it deter sim swap?
17:07:22 <defconanon12[m]> I never done it myself but isn't that the default that comes with any of the newer phones? The screen before the lockscreen?
17:07:27 <LynnStephenson[4> <j3ghprjfo[m] "Also can it deter sim swap? "> No. Ask your phone company to need physical interaction(like a local shop) to get a new SIM.
17:10:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wait who was the guy who suggested disabling hardware offload?
17:10:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> "j3ghprjfo" (https://matrix.to/#/@j3ghprjfo:matrix.org): no I won't

17:58:33 <strcat[m]> catharsis_: sounds like you paired multiple times
17:58:54 <strcat[m]> each pairing counts as a new device, if you disable remote attestation you need to delete the old pairing in the UI or it's going to warn you about it
17:59:15 <strcat[m]> catharsis_: look at what you have paired there, and look at when they last submitted an attestation
18:04:19 <cereal_eater> strcat[m]: are you referring to me?

18:08:52 <aragorndr[m]> is there a way to make qwant the default search engine in vanadium?
18:09:23 <cereal_eater> so should I delete all devices that I get an alert from?
18:12:19 <dazinism> strcat: was thinking may be good to add some text to auditor listing on izzyondroid?
18:12:47 <strcat[m]> dazinism: *shrug* don't know anything about that
18:13:06 <strcat[m]> aragorndr: visit it, use it, then set it as a default
18:13:07 <cereal_eater> how much does the attestation affect battery life?
18:13:10 <strcat[m]> search engines show up as options after using them
18:13:14 <strcat[m]> as long as they have proper metadata
18:13:17 <strcat[m]> cereal_eater: doesn't really
18:13:30 <aragorndr[m]> thanks
18:13:52 <dazinism> strcat : Noticed description on Play doesnt really explain anything about attestation server or mention GrapheneOS
18:13:56 <strcat[m]> it's only every few hours for a fraction of a second and it doesn't bypass the idle scheduling stuff at all
18:14:18 <strcat[m]> it's not specific to GrapheneOS
18:14:36 <cereal_eater> so changing the verify interval hours and Permitted delay until alerts doesn't matter?
18:14:53 <dazinism> Was thinking it may be good to ask izzyondroid to add something, when I ask them to add Auditor to their repo?
18:16:04 <cereal_eater> thanks strcat[m]
18:16:34 <strcat[m]> cereal_eater: don't know what you mean by doesn't matter
18:16:40 <strcat[m]> it won't have any significant impact on battery life if that's what you mean
18:17:02 <dazinism> Actually Play listing doesnt even mention that remote attestation is possible
18:17:25 <cereal_eater> yes, I thought I could save batter life, when prolonging the intervals
18:39:16 <Syrillic[m]> So does GrapheneOS plan to support new pixel phones launching?
18:40:33 <blacklight447[m]> Pixel 4 is in the developement branch atm i think
18:41:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> "Syrillic" (https://matrix.to/#/@syrillic:matrix.org): yes
18:42:26 <interceptingfist> Is 5g going to be a option to be disabled?
18:42:39 <Syrillic[m]> Oh really did that just happen? Cause I checked like awhile ago it was never there
18:43:40 <frenchieisverige> <interceptingfist "Is 5g going to be a option to be"> Why so?
18:45:17 <Syrillic[m]> Yea why would you want to disable that
18:46:18 <Syrillic[m]> Do you guys think GrapheneOS on iPhone is possible with this https://projectsandcastle.org/
18:47:12 <strcat[m]> no
18:47:15 <strcat[m]> doesn't support what's required
18:48:23 <strcat[m]> there will be no GrapheneOS for devices not meeting the functionality and security requirements - it's the same answer every time
18:48:39 <madaidan[m]> Exploiting your device to install a security-focused OS is ironic
18:57:13 <jacob[m]> Yeah I do not see what the point of that is, Jailbreak is literally based off of security flaws within iOS
18:59:26 <Syrillic[m]> Yea true
19:01:05 <interceptingfist> frenchieisverige: Syrillic  because 5g isn't needed at all
19:01:53 <jacob[m]> I mean project Sandcastle is cool just as a technology thing but shouldn‚Äôt be considered for running Graphene in iOS. Plus iOS, is pretty secure already
19:02:04 <interceptingfist> 5g has shorter range, having a phone constantly becalming for a 5g network will drain the battery
19:02:18 <jacob[m]> * I mean project Sandcastle is cool just as a technology thing but shouldn‚Äôt be considered for running Graphene in iOS. Plus iOS is pretty secure already

19:03:06 <frenchieisverige> <interceptingfist "5g has shorter range, having a p"> Yes, so as LTE does as well
19:03:19 <interceptingfist> 5g can also pinpoint your location more effectively
19:04:11 <interceptingfist> <frenchieisverige "Yes, so as LTE does as well"> I don't need anything faster, it works perfect
19:06:53 <frenchieisverige> You always think that. When I got VDSL I thought it was enough, now fiber is more and more relevant for 4k content for example. The same pattern can be apply here
19:09:12 <interceptingfist> Yeah I have home WiFi with those kind of speeds
19:10:06 <cn3m[m]> I trust my family with iPhones more due to them actually having an app store and the stronger permissions. Most people will be tricked into installing an app likely with too many permissions. Android 11 will help a little
19:10:21 <interceptingfist> I know it'll be convenient, but that the problem. We pay for this convenience and they turn around and spy on us and/or use it for control (like China)
19:11:14 <cn3m[m]> I don't know why someone would hack GrapheneOS on iPhone. It would be worse than on a Pixel and worse than iOS. Even if it actually did anything (which it wouldn't)
19:11:52 <interceptingfist> cn3m: I bought a iPhone 7 for 140 bucks, going to keep certain things on it and only on vpn wifi
19:12:26 <interceptingfist> I currently have graphene and love it
19:12:41 <interceptingfist> Its my actual use phone
19:12:51 <strcat[m]> cn3m: no meaningful permissions are granted on install, the meaningful permissions are requested at runtime
19:13:35 <strcat[m]> the low-level permissions are largely just there for static analysis, opportunistic attack surface reduction and moving towards future meaningful permissions
19:13:54 <strcat[m]> they don't do what people seem to think they do
19:14:09 <strcat[m]> for example half of them only exist to allow an app to REQUEST permission dynamically
19:14:19 <frenchieisverige> <interceptingfist "I know it'll be convenient, but "> Well, even with LTE your phone provider can see where you are with some basic triangulation. 5g might get more precise, but does not change the problem.

19:27:13 <LynnStephenson[4> <cn3m[m] "interceptingfist: Your OS is eit"> But then your eggs are in one basket. Just saying.
19:27:14 <strcat[m]> they can't make the permission model better, they can't make the app sandbox better
19:27:18 <strcat[m]> they can't improve OS privacy or security
19:27:19 <cn3m[m]> When you use an OS on your phone you completely trust that maker of the OS. Trust them for everything you can possibly manage as you already have to trust them. Don't add extra trusted parties to fail you potentially
19:27:33 <strcat[m]> mxnorvak: if you think an app can be scanned to check if it's safe, you're very confused

19:30:04 <strcat[m]> scanning apps for common analytics/telemetry/advertising SDKs is not accomplishing much
19:30:13 <strcat[m]> it shows which apps incorporate those common frameworks for doing it
19:30:30 <strcat[m]> it doesn't show which apps avoid privacy invasive actions at all
19:30:32 <cn3m[m]> <interceptingfist "cn3m: I trust graphene, I don't "> Then don't use any Apple devices or OSes. That's your root of trust
19:30:39 <strcat[m]> lack of those common frameworks doesn't mean an app is privacy respecting - FAR from it
19:31:18 <cn3m[m]> Facebook has no trackers on that site
19:31:19 <strcat[m]> and I'd suggest educating yourself on what those actually do and thinking about what you seem to think 'tracking' is in this context and what those have to do with it
19:31:39 <jalb66> strcat[m], talking about permissions, I'm always worried with the frontal camera and thinking if disabling all the permissions to the camera app and to the microphone and also stopping the camera app, if it would be possible to make the camera work and record me or not in some way

19:31:55 <defconanon12[m]> anupritaisno1: Alright no media playback issues when I did a 25 minute test with my Bluetooth headphones. I also noticed the audio has improved after I untoggled the disable hardware setting.
19:32:23 <strcat[m]> jalb66: my suggestion is to learn how the app sandbox and permission model works and stop fretting about things you don't understand before trying to learn about it
19:32:24 <cn3m[m]> It's simple trust your stock apps over everything else
19:32:38 <cn3m[m]> Apple and GrapheneOS know what they are doing
19:32:43 <jalb66> strcat[m], I'm only worried and paranoid when I go to the bathroom lol
19:32:59 <strcat[m]> again my suggestion is to educate yourself
19:33:10 <strcat[m]> first educate yourself, then ask questions here about what you don't understand
19:33:12 <jalb66> Ok, but meanwhile I'm worried about it
19:33:25 <strcat[m]> don't ask questions before reading
19:34:03 <interceptingfist> cn3m: how/why do you choose to trust apple?
19:34:13 <strcat[m]> if you want to come up with fantasies to worry about that's your choice
19:34:14 <LynnStephenson[4> <cn3m[m] "Apple and GrapheneOS know what t"> Eh. I don't see what is wrong with choosing a different, good alternative to the stock.
19:34:30 <jalb66> Ok
19:34:42 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: most apps have bad privacy and security
19:34:49 <cn3m[m]> You added another link in the chain
19:35:03 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: using an alternate keyboard trusts that keyboard with access to a lot of private data
19:35:04 <interceptingfist> I just lagged sorry if that posted twice
19:35:05 <strcat[m]> it doesn't just mean you trust it not to be malicious
19:35:07 <cn3m[m]> Your keyboard is covered in the trust model of your OS
19:35:09 <LynnStephenson[4> <cn3m[m] "You added another link in the ch"> But if you can verify it's trustworthy what is wrong?
19:35:14 <strcat[m]> you trust it to be properly maintained, to care about privacy and security, and to not be exploitable
19:35:26 <strcat[m]> you trust it not to accidentally leak data
19:35:28 <strcat[m]> you trust it not to be compromised via the supply chain
19:35:32 <mxnorvak[m]> Actually when it comes to choosing an app, i look at the apps business model, what permissions it requires, its history regrading how it treats user data and if it is open source, has there been any independent audit, is this good enough?
19:35:33 <LynnStephenson[4> <strcat[m] "Lynn Stephenson: most apps have "> Depends. But I guess.
19:35:50 <strcat[m]> an app being open source doesn't make it more secure or private
19:36:06 <strcat[m]> maybe it makes you feel it's more trustworthy but that's very questionable
19:36:13 <LynnStephenson[4> <strcat[m] "an app being open source doesn't"> I knowwww.
19:36:25 <cn3m[m]> You add a ton of trust for no good
19:36:45 <LynnStephenson[4> But if it is open source other people, including you can verify if it's trustworthy.
19:37:04 <cn3m[m]> My keyboard is important Apple and Graphene is all I want
19:37:23 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: I don't see how you can do that
19:37:36 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: feel good fantasy not based in reality
19:37:59 <strcat[m]> an app being trustworthy is about whether you trust the developers and their approach to privacy and security
19:38:09 <LynnStephenson[4> All I'm saying is that it's possible to verify open source applications, and if it's trustworthy then it shouldn't be a problem adding it to your chain of trust.
19:38:14 <strcat[m]> I am not sure what licensing of the code has to do with it
19:38:26 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: no, it's not possible to 'verify' them in the sense you mean any more so than it is for closed source ones
19:38:48 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: and you're very confused about privacy and security to be saying things like that
19:38:52 <cn3m[m]> <LynnStephenson[4 "All I'm saying is that it's poss"> You still add unneeded risk
19:38:54 <strcat[m]> and I'd suggest reading my earlier answer
19:39:42 <cn3m[m]> Inherently
19:40:06 <strcat[m]> > you trust it not to be compromised via the supply chain
19:40:06 <strcat[m]> > you trust it not to accidentally leak data
19:40:06 <strcat[m]> > you trust it to be properly maintained, to care about privacy and security, and to not be exploitable
19:40:31 <strcat[m]> an app being open source doesn't mean the developers care any more about security or about privacy
19:40:32 <LynnStephenson[4> <strcat[m] "an app being trustworthy is abou"> And reviewing the source code ...
19:40:32 <strcat[m]> and doesn't mean they take a better approach to privacy or security
19:40:35 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't mean it's any easier to verify anything about that
19:40:46 <cn3m[m]> Why trust 2 keyboard when you can trust one?
19:40:56 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: and what does that accomplish, and what about it could not be done for a closed source app
19:41:04 <LynnStephenson[4> <cn3m[m] "Why trust 2 keyboard when you ca"> Who said you had to use both?
19:41:10 <LynnStephenson[4> <strcat[m] "Lynn Stephenson: and you're very"> That is certainly not the case.
19:41:12 <cn3m[m]> It's always best to trust your OS developer over everyone else
19:41:23 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: it is the case
19:41:29 <LynnStephenson[4> <strcat[m] "an app being open source doesn't"> I know that! I said it means you and other people can verify if it is.
19:41:48 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: no, they can't really, and not in any way that's different from a closed source app
19:41:53 <strcat[m]> because you can review the code of an app without the original sources either way
19:42:03 <strcat[m]> and again
19:42:15 <strcat[m]> I'm not really sure what you think that accomplishes in practice
19:42:18 <cn3m[m]> <LynnStephenson[4 "I know that! I said it means you"> That's already been done for the one built into the trust model of your OS. It was better done by a system already trusted
19:42:26 <strcat[m]> you still have to decide if you trust the developers of the app
19:42:38 <strcat[m]> and you are still trusting them either way
19:42:39 <strcat[m]> you are not realistically avoiding any trust in them
19:43:02 <strcat[m]> it's easy for people who don't know about to make claims like that but it's not true
19:43:03 <EssentialChaos[m> So is using Gboard better?
19:43:16 <LynnStephenson[4> Hold up for a second.
19:43:33 <LynnStephenson[4> Everything you guys are describing is a process I have already went through.
19:43:33 <cn3m[m]> <EssentialChaos[m "So is using Gboard better?"> Use GrapheneOS Keyboard or Apple Keyboard
19:43:51 <cn3m[m]> For best privacy and security
19:43:55 <EssentialChaos[m> <cn3m[m] "Use GrapheneOS Keyboard or Apple"> But I don't have either of those
19:44:16 <strcat[m]> this channel is for GrapheneOS
19:44:17 <defconanon12[m]> I trust Graphene OS keyboard over Anysoftkeyboard. I really like the approach to how they implemented security and privacy. For an example clipboard leaks are nonexistent.
19:45:04 <EssentialChaos[m> <strcat[m] "this channel is for GrapheneOS"> Yes, I know and I find it interesting
19:45:05 <j3ghprjfo[m]> It's all a trust game and how feel about it. Unless you have the technical skills and time to go over everything line by line you're just trusting one party or another. For all I know grapheneos could be a honeypot, or their could be undiscovered bits of code from Google in aosp that could install apps silently, who knows? It's all about trust
19:45:43 <strcat[m]> j3ghprjfo: going over it line by line doesn't mean you don't trust the developers
19:46:13 <LynnStephenson[4> I'm not saying you should use an alternative keyboard over GrapheneOS's. I'm saying that if you can verify the application is secure if it's open source (closed source even by de-compiling). It is an analogy.
19:46:32 <strcat[m]> people who aren't developers and particularly people who aren't developers with expertise on privacy/security
19:46:41 <strcat[m]> need to stop making outrageous claims far outside what they actually know about
19:46:59 <zozu[m]> Agreed
19:47:07 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: I don't think you can reasonably verify that an app is secure
19:47:12 <LynnStephenson[4> I have a real example for you. cn3m strcat
19:47:25 <cn3m[m]> Accidents are hard to find. Intentional issues are much harder
19:47:33 <LynnStephenson[4> https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1956
19:47:36 <strcat[m]> you can get a good idea of how the app approaches security and privacy
19:47:48 <strcat[m]> but you are still trusting the developers
19:47:57 <strcat[m]> and if they were malicious I'm sure it'd benefit them to pretend they have a good security and privacy stance
19:48:36 <strcat[m]> Lynn Stephenson: why are you posting FUD / misinformation about the hardware-backed keystore?
19:48:38 <strcat[m]> hmm
19:49:00 <strcat[m]> and look, if this channel is used to propagate misinformation
19:49:11 <strcat[m]> it can be for developers only
20:38:23 <strcat[m]> channel break over
20:42:58 <concat[m]> strcat How was Lynn spreading FUD?
20:43:20 <strcat[m]> concat: in the linked issue tracker
20:44:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): what are your thoughts on upstreaming out of tree drivers?
20:44:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not techpack/qcacld
20:44:54 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: takes 1-2 years to get drivers upstream and starts after devices are in production
20:44:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Stuff like drivers/net/ethernet/aquantia (atlfwd)
20:45:18 <strcat[m]> and then it takes up to 1 year for a new LTS branch to come out
20:45:18 <cn3m[m]> anupritaisno1: I'll get that log up. I'm working on it right now
20:45:27 <strcat[m]> so even if a device moved to a newer LTS branch
20:45:37 <strcat[m]> it just takes so long for anything to get upstream
20:45:38 <strcat[m]> and it being upstream doesn't mean anything is testing it upstream especially without FULL device support there
20:45:40 <strcat[m]> there are ENTIRE ARCHITECTURES that are effectively not tested with mainline
20:45:43 <strcat[m]> so they break for months at a time
20:45:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> "strcat" (https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): sorry kinda tired I meant merging the upstream into ours
20:45:46 <strcat[m]> and have huge regressions
20:45:59 <strcat[m]> having it upstream just helps make maintenance easier - it doesn't mean the upstream support will keep working
20:46:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> For those drivers
20:46:23 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: as in using newer versions of them?
20:46:28 <strcat[m]> I don't quite know what you mean
20:46:42 <strcat[m]> I'd rather make minimal changes to drivers, changing anything causes problems
20:47:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Meant something different
20:47:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes as long as they don't cause instability
20:47:55 <the0d0r3[m]> \o/
20:48:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might explore as a last priority then
20:49:30 <cn3m[m]> the0d0r3: hey
20:49:41 <the0d0r3[m]> strcat: glad you're still working on cool stuff :-)
20:49:52 <cn3m[m]> Welcome
20:52:44 <the0d0r3[m]> Hey, thanks for the warm welcome
20:53:14 <the0d0r3[m]> Also sorry for the delay, matrix is lagging hard rn, taking like 5m to send a msg.
20:53:54 <strcat[m]> the0d0r3: I'd recommend using an IRC client instead
20:54:11 <strcat[m]> it's lagging for me by maybe 5s or so at the moment
20:54:12 <strcat[m]> but IRC doesn't have that lag
20:54:55 <strcat[m]> there are issues with different matrix home servers and then the bridge being used here
20:55:16 <the0d0r3[m]> I don't trust IRC clients, I trust my browser more :-( sad times.
20:55:22 <strcat[m]> the bridge is also really annoying in some ways, I particularly dislike how it mass kicks people from the Matrix channel if they're idle for 30 days or something like that
20:55:49 <the0d0r3[m]> Yeah, feels like someones ddosing matrix.org atm
20:56:46 <strcat[m]> the0d0r3: it's always like this
20:56:54 <LynnStephenson[4> <the0d0r3[m] "Yeah, feels like someones ddosin"> There's been quite a few issues with that home server. It probably is under attack, unfortunately.
20:56:56 <strcat[m]> sometimes a lot worse
20:57:14 <strcat> this channel is an IRC channel with a bridged Matrix room connected to it
20:57:42 <strcat> but canonically it's an IRC channel, we just set up a proper bridged room to it with aliases (#grapheneos:matrix.org, etc.)
20:58:03 <strcat> maybe we could approach Matrix support differently but it's a real mess if we want to try to migrate people
20:58:13 <the0d0r3[m]> Damnit, I'm trying to troll J about efnet
20:58:20 <strcat> because there will be fragmentation
20:58:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> m.apex.to is a good server "Lynn Stephenson" (https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com)
20:58:35 <strcat> the0d0r3[m]: he reads this channel btw, and any other public communications

20:58:58 <the0d0r3[m]> Ah fair.
20:58:59 <the0d0r3[m]> That's fine :-)
20:59:01 <the0d0r3[m]> If he can work out who I am good on him
20:59:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wouldn't be surprised
21:11:44 <the0d0r3[m]> bruce + bugtraq are all you should need to fill in the blanks
21:17:55 <brenneke[m]> What is the purpose of the Auditor app?
21:23:12 <privacy_based_li> brenneke: verify device ID and os integrity

21:24:38 <strcat[m]> brenneke: https://attestation.app/about and https://attestation.app/tutorial are a good starting point
21:25:20 <interceptingfist> Why does riot have something I typed a long time ago at the bottom of the chat? It won't go away
21:27:54 <privacy_based_li> strcat: I was planning to convince my parents and family members to get pixel 3, is the support for them ending soon?
21:28:25 <strcat[m]> privacy_based_lifeform: no

21:29:19 <interceptingfist> <privacy_based_li "strcat: I was planning to convin"> Just a FYI I out graphene is on pixel 3 and for some reason the battery life wasn't near as good as the 3a
21:29:28 <privacy_based_li> awesome!
21:30:14 <privacy_based_li> <interceptingfist "Just a FYI I out graphene is on "> they need water resistant phones
21:30:19 <interceptingfist> * Just a FYI I put graphene os on pixel 3 and for some reason the battery life wasn't near as good as the 3a
21:32:01 <dazinism> P3 has ~a year and a quarter guaranteed support left
21:33:27 <strcat[m]> and keep in mind the phones often get a few extra months of support
21:33:29 <strcat[m]> past the guarantee
21:33:31 <dazinism> Nice to see new Auditor  release is out with support for Pixel 4 GrapheneOS
21:33:56 <strcat[m]> yeah I lack the time / energy to go through the MANY samples and add all the other devices people submitted samples for though
21:33:57 <strcat[m]> I need help doing that
21:34:02 <strcat[m]> it's mostly straightforward and people could help make tooling to make it easier
21:34:18 <privacy_based_li> <strcat[m] "past the guarantee"> you are awesomeüòä
21:34:19 <strcat[m]> the current process is annoying since you have to keep sideloading the app builds onto a device to test samples there
21:34:26 <strcat[m]> but AttestationServer has code that could run on the workstation
21:34:59 <strcat[m]> so the AttestationServer code could be extended to support something like a CLI option to handle a sample
21:35:00 <strcat[m]> instead of running the service
21:35:00 <strcat[m]> to get the relevant info
21:35:05 <strcat[m]> instead of the really annoying current approach
21:35:10 <interceptingfist> dazinism: yes riot x
21:35:25 <strcat[m]> anyway if anyone is interested in adding 40 more supported devices to Auditor... just requires straightforward work on it
21:35:35 <strcat[m]> I just don't want to do that all myself anymore so if people won't help, I'll only support devices GrapheneOS does
21:35:55 <dazinism> interceptingfist: if you goto the settings in the app > general > clear cache
21:36:01 <strcat[m]> I think I demonstrated that Auditor can easily support tons and tons of devices if people submit samples + people help with handling the samples
21:36:06 <strcat[m]> up to people to step up to help now
21:36:10 <strcat[m]> done demonstrating it's possible
21:36:46 <interceptingfist> dazinism: ok
21:46:23 <interceptingfist> I think it worked
22:04:22 <Cyrinux[m]> Hi
22:04:23 <Cyrinux[m]> Dark theme with switch on sunset is working for you?
22:04:55 <Cyrinux[m]> It is possible to get a switch base on manual  time set?
22:28:11 <strcat[m]> the 'on sunset' thing depends on location in a way that doesn't really work with only GNSS (GPS, etc.)
22:28:29 <strcat[m]> it somewhat depends on having a network-based location service to give a quick approximate response to the query
22:28:48 <strcat[m]> so, technically it could work as is but... in practice you won't have a GPS lock when it checks and it won't wait
22:29:11 <strcat[m]> I think if you left the phone there sitting with a map app open keeping a GPS lock
22:29:17 <strcat[m]> then when it checks location for that feature it'd get one
23:18:04 <madaidan[m]> Why does every default app have the sensors permission by default? I know that it needs to be allowed by default for new apps since it's a GrapheneOS change but can't it be configured for the base system at least?
23:21:11 <aeonsolution[m]> <madaidan[m] "Why does every default app have "> You might want to look into: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview
23:22:11 <aeonsolution[m]> If there is something there that you would find useful, you can open up a github issue and it could get added to the backlog
23:22:41 <madaidan[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "You might want to look into: htt"> I know how permissions work.
23:23:12 <madaidan[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "If there is something there that"> I'm asking a question.
23:24:14 <aeonsolution[m]> I'm not saying you don't. I meant with regards to the project this is something worth looking into if you could find out where this is controlled in AOSP.
23:37:00 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: because apps (built in or not) don't include metadata saying if they use sensors since it's not an existing permission
23:37:16 <TheJollyRoger> madaidan[m]: it's enabled because turning it off by default will break any apps not specifically written with GrapheneOS in mind.
23:37:34 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: we could stop automatically adding it for built-in apps and then any built-in app that actually uses sensors wouldn't work anymore
23:37:36 <TheJollyRoger> **any apps that rely on sensors that aren't specifically
23:37:47 <strcat[m]> we'd have to go through all the built-in apps and mark the ones using sensors
23:38:00 <strcat[m]> has not been a priority
23:38:35 <strcat[m]> also we're using standard infrastructure for adding a new permission
23:38:50 <strcat[m]> it doesn't special case built-in apps, it's based on API level and works the same for all apps
23:39:14 <strcat[m]> madaidan.: an app being built-in doesn't really make it special, a normal built-in app can't do anything a non-built-in app can't and is treated the same way
23:39:30 <TheJollyRoger> If an app is not written to handle a "Security Exception" Error gracefully for something that's assumed to be the default, most likely it'll just crash or lock up, right?
23:40:00 <strcat[m]> the sensors permission doesn't result in a SecurityException when toggled off
23:40:10 <strcat[m]> it results in silently receiving zeroed data
23:40:15 <TheJollyRoger> oh!
23:40:16 <TheJollyRoger> Oh makes sense.
23:41:11 <TheJollyRoger> Makes sense, then the app won't know it's running on GrapheneOS.
23:41:45 <TheJollyRoger> Aargh... testing out these debugging cables now, and I forgot which ways plug in where >_<.
23:41:58 <TheJollyRoger> Since the new Mk. IIIs can be plugged in upside down or backwards.
23:43:27 <TheJollyRoger> There any way I can test Minicom to see if it's getting input from the FT-232, or is just blanking out? Would go a bit of a way to helping me figure out if I connected the order wrong...
23:43:33 <TheJollyRoger> Since I really hope I haven't wired this batch wrong.
23:46:37 <defconanon12[m]> The only app that I have broken by turning the sensors off was Silence.
