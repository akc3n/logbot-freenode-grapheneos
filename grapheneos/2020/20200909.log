00:05:37 <brockin042[m]> gonner11: yes, I have a google fi pixel 2. The only issue is trying to send or receive MMS text messages. Doesn't work.
00:27:21 <cant_unlock> I can't unlock my pixel 2. I'm in the bootloader, device state: locked
00:27:37 <cant_unlock> I followed the instructions and OEM unlock is on, USB debuging is on...
00:27:49 <cant_unlock> anyway has suggestions? This is a project fi phone
00:28:11 <aeonsolution[m]> <i_am_your_device "I have a pixel 4a and would like"> we need people to help us test building GrapheneOS, this is step 0 to help us out https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
00:28:58 <aeonsolution[m]> once you can do that, then you can up us test the kernel for the new version of Android for your specific device family
00:29:01 <cant_unlock> my other device is pixel4a btw
00:29:13 <cant_unlock> is this works on my pixel 2... I'd be happy to help
00:29:53 <aeonsolution[m]> we dont have enough people to support moving the Pixel 2 family to Android 11
00:30:24 <aeonsolution[m]> for GrapheneOS, its a lot of work and not enough people willing to pitch in
00:31:13 <aeonsolution[m]> as per the website, GrapheneOS supports Pixel 3 and Pixel 4 family devices
00:31:53 <cant_unlock> is this a bot?
00:36:31 <dazinism> sandroteem: Auditor can give some guarantees. Guess it depends what you are worried about, what you want to prove & to who...
00:36:39 <cant_unlock> Someone here have experience with this: if the device says "device state: locked" in boot loader, does that mean the phone cannot be unlocked?
00:36:45 <cant_unlock> This is a porject fi pixel 2 phone
00:37:04 <dazinism> How big the threat is...
00:37:45 <dazinism> If you are really worried using a device, which you don't know the history of isn't great...
00:41:14 <dazinism> cant_unlock: check the website. Need to go into android settings on device, enable developer options, enable OEM unlocking
00:41:51 <cant_unlock> @dazinism thanks, I followed all of that. I'm after these steps. developer mode is one. OEM is unlocked.
00:41:52 <dazinism> and aeon isnt a bot!
00:42:19 <dazinism> ...well if they are they are a very helpful one  üòÜ
00:42:23 <cant_unlock> running the fastboot command just says it's waiting for a device to connect
00:43:02 <dazinism> Probably means you need to try a different usb lead or port
00:43:18 <dazinism> Or you have an ancient version of fastboot
00:43:43 <cant_unlock> dazinism did this too - this is a USB cable that is verified to work for data transfer when the phone is booted normally
00:43:48 <dazinism> fastboot --version
00:43:54 <cant_unlock> it is also my third USB cable attempted, the other two were power only
00:44:17 <cant_unlock> fastboot version 30.0.4-6686687
00:45:02 <dazinism> fastboot is a bit more demanding of good quality lead and/or port
00:45:27 <dazinism> Can fail when data transfer and adb don't
00:45:29 <cant_unlock> @dazinism - OK, and it has to be able to transfer data right?
00:45:53 <cant_unlock> asking because my good thick cable is power only.. anyway ok I am trying another cable
00:46:03 <dazinism> fastboot flashing unlock
00:46:46 <dazinism> You using a usb A - C lead?
00:47:01 <cant_unlock> Yes
00:47:05 <aeonsolution[m]> <dazinism "and aeon isnt a bot!"> i might as well be to the drones lol
00:47:07 <cant_unlock> I don't need sudo right?
00:47:11 <cant_unlock> (I'm on Debian)
00:47:28 <cant_unlock> another cable, same result
00:47:33 <aeonsolution[m]> dazinism:  ‚ô•Ô∏è
00:47:36 <cant_unlock> trying another USB port
00:47:59 <dazinism> Depends if you've followed the instructions on the website properly
00:48:21 <cant_unlock> this instructions say no sudo... I tried both
00:48:28 <dazinism> If you've set PATH dont need sudo
00:48:29 <cant_unlock> it does not work with another port on the computer either
00:48:43 <cant_unlock> ah, but I didn't set path. I had an issue
00:48:56 <cant_unlock> I changed to dir and I'm doing ./fastboot
00:49:01 <cant_unlock> shoudl work just the same though
00:49:02 <dazinism> If you tried sudo, think probably might as well continue with that
00:49:13 <cant_unlock> sudo gives me a permission issue
00:49:31 <cant_unlock> "sudo ./fastboot flashing unlockFAILED (remote: 'Flashing Unlock is not allowed')fastboot: error: Command failed"
00:49:46 <dazinism> Think you need udev rules for debian
00:49:56 <dazinism> I've not had to set them up
00:50:01 <cant_unlock> udev?
00:50:11 <dazinism> Have you done that?
00:50:20 <cant_unlock> I don't know what udev rules is
00:50:25 <cant_unlock> so no, I guess I haven't :)
00:50:51 <dazinism> Its something to do with usb security
00:51:11 <dazinism> Opens things up so you can communicate down usb
00:51:16 <cant_unlock> hmmmm
00:51:38 <dazinism> Hang on I'll find something....
00:51:41 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules
00:52:01 <aeonsolution[m]> the ubuntu rules should work
00:52:04 <aeonsolution[m]> for debian
00:52:20 <aeonsolution[m]> gl cant_unlock
00:52:48 <cant_unlock> interesting. ok I'm cloning one sec
00:52:53 <cant_unlock> and thanks for the help
00:54:07 <dazinism> Actually, thinking about it,  if you using sudo think you wont need udev...
00:54:24 <aeonsolution[m]> they might not have sudo installed
00:54:35 <aeonsolution[m]> its easier to get them to use the udev rules
00:54:50 <aeonsolution[m]> its up to the user to get their distro to recognize their device
00:55:16 <aeonsolution[m]> or use to arch üòõ
00:56:11 <cant_unlock> Eh well I'm tryng to follow the instructions there I get some commands not found
00:56:19 <cant_unlock> some Path issues Debian has these damn
00:56:25 <dazinism> No need for the ./
00:56:31 <dazinism> Just
00:56:43 <dazinism> sudo fastboot flashing unlock
00:56:58 <cant_unlock> it won't find it but I'll try
00:57:22 <cant_unlock> yep. command not found
00:57:26 <cant_unlock> fastboot is not in my path
00:59:50 <aeonsolution[m]> when you set the path following the instructions on the website
00:59:51 <aeonsolution[m]> do not open up new windows
01:00:15 <aeonsolution[m]> the path does not get carried over, because you only set it temporarily
01:02:09 <aeonsolution[m]> <gonner11 "I turned on developer options as"> this assumes you have fastbooth on your path, https://source.android.com/setup/build/running#unlocking-the-bootloader
01:04:26 <cant_unlock> If I set the path it forgets what is on the path before and I lose other commands
01:04:44 <cant_unlock> doesn't matter ./ should work if it's not on the path. something else is off
01:05:43 <aeonsolution[m]> you are doing it wrong if you losing your commands
01:05:57 <aeonsolution[m]> dont edit any .profile or .bashrc files if you dont know what your doing
01:06:10 <aeonsolution[m]> just follow the instructions on the website
01:06:13 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot
01:06:22 <cant_unlock> I just did it. Same issue.
01:06:32 <aeonsolution[m]> if you lost all your commands, restart your computer
01:06:38 <cant_unlock> "< waiting for any device >"
01:07:02 <cant_unlock> oh I see what I did wrong before with the path command. ok my bad. but I still have the same issue
01:07:06 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, because your distro doesnt let you use the usb to connect your device as a local user
01:07:11 <cant_unlock> that is, fastboot is in my path now, still doesn't work
01:07:17 <cant_unlock> ah ha.
01:07:23 <aeonsolution[m]> yes, that is another problem
01:07:34 <aeonsolution[m]> that why you use android udev rules
01:07:42 <aeonsolution[m]> to avoid having to use sudo
01:07:56 <cant_unlock> wouldn't sudo work...? I did try to clone and install udev rules
01:08:29 <aeonsolution[m]> i cant help you troubleshoot that issue because i dont use a distro that makes me do that, i just install the udev rules
01:08:43 <aeonsolution[m]> again, setup the rules https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules
01:09:34 <cant_unlock> ok. I will look more into that, I ran into some issues installing (following their instructions) but that looks more promising
01:10:08 <aeonsolution[m]> gl
01:10:41 <cant_unlock> one question. when I do run fastboot with sudo, I get "FAILED (remote: Flashing Unlock is not allowed)"
01:10:55 <cant_unlock> is that the same issue with the udev tools, or, something is wrong with the phone?
01:10:57 <aeonsolution[m]> because of your distro rules
01:11:01 <cant_unlock> ok. got it.
01:11:19 <cant_unlock> Thanks aeonsolution[m] I'm going to work on this.
01:11:21 <aeonsolution[m]> if you dont know how to fix that then there's is no point jumping down the system administration rabbit hole
01:11:32 <aeonsolution[m]> just setup android udev rules
01:13:43 <birdie[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "just setup android udev rules"> I've been curious about that, is that only for some distros? Cause I didn't have to do that for manjaro. Just used this easy install script https://github.com/Peter-Easton/grapheneos-easy-installer
01:14:39 <aeonsolution[m]> birdie: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android
01:17:01 <inthewaves[m]> How does porting work? Is it, for the most part, cherry-picking GrapheneOS-related commits from the old `10` branch into the `11` branches and testing them?
01:17:33 <inthewaves[m]> I've noticed the site switched over to mention the 11 branch now: https://grapheneos.org/build#development-branch
01:17:36 <aeonsolution[m]> high level overview yes
01:18:35 <aeonsolution[m]> you have to checkout the kernel from google
01:18:50 <aeonsolution[m]> what device do you have
01:19:05 <inthewaves[m]> 3a
01:19:14 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice
01:21:09 <aeonsolution[m]> each device has a kernel that is provided by google as a prebuilt
01:21:17 <aeonsolution[m]> go here https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/
01:21:20 <aeonsolution[m]> find your device
01:21:31 <aeonsolution[m]> clone the project
01:22:10 <aeonsolution[m]> and cherry-pick everything from GOS github for your corresponding device kernel
01:22:54 <aeonsolution[m]> you start with commits that dont come from google, you get them from the project
01:23:38 <dazinism> Hey inthewaves nice to have you here!
01:24:01 <dazinism> Noticed on github all the stuff you've been doing
01:24:37 <dazinism> Some interesting things you been upto
01:24:41 <aeonsolution[m]> anu and i have a kernel for the beta, anu may have a new one now. what you would do in that case, is instead of doing that manual work you would clone our projects and put the our kernel where the prebuilt one is put
01:24:56 <aeonsolution[m]> here https://grapheneos.org/build#kernel
01:25:11 <aeonsolution[m]> and then build out the os and see if it works on your device
01:26:11 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/theaeonsolution/kernel_google_crosshatch/tree/11-preview-4
01:26:27 <aeonsolution[m]> here is an oldish kernel
01:26:43 <birdie[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "birdie: https://wiki.archlinux.o"> Thanks I'll read that
01:27:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> cdesai: the entire "guide" could be shortened quite a fair bit
01:28:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh I ignored the binary stage. Building without a vendor for now
01:43:01 <aeonsolution[m]> oh nice, the kernel for the beta is the same as 11 üï∂Ô∏è

02:00:47 <inthewaves[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "you start with commits that dont"> Thanks, I'll look into it
02:01:05 <aeonsolution[m]> inthewaves: send me a message if you need help
02:01:16 <aeonsolution[m]> glad to have you checking this out!
02:02:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> aeonsolution: you can invite him to that chat
02:19:35 <inthewaves[m]> ls
02:41:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> kryptonymous stop spamming reactions
02:58:38 <kryptonymous[m]> didn't know that was spamming anupritaisno1:. Was just catching up on the thread and reacting. BTW, I appreciate all you do for the community. üôÇ
03:33:08 <mmcblk0[m]> Please, how can i works alarm on GOS?
03:38:18 <strcat[m]> use the standard alarm clock app?
03:49:37 <dan-v[m]> strcat: do you happen to know off top of your head if we are going to run into our usual chromium webview incompatibility issue
03:49:49 <dan-v[m]> otherwise i'll go take a look
03:51:00 <mmcblk0[m]> <strcat[m] "use the standard alarm clock app"> yes, but not works
03:54:21 <lickidysplit[m]> Works fine for me
03:54:21 <lickidysplit[m]> Did u set it for correct AM/PM? üòÇ
03:59:51 <dan-v[m]> strcat: look like v86+ has sdk set to R
04:05:21 <strcat[m]> dan-v: yes and current version is 85
04:05:28 <strcat[m]> so unless we use beta, similar issue
04:05:31 <strcat[m]> I'll just use stock WebView temporarily
04:05:33 <strcat[m]> save trouble
04:06:28 <dan-v[m]> sounds good strcat - i'll probably do the same initially until things are working and then give beta a shot
04:07:48 <strcat[m]> cdesai: seedvault and setupwizard will need to be ported
04:08:03 <strcat[m]> setupwizard breaks the build atm
04:08:40 <strcat[m]> Vanadium itself (browser only) works
04:24:38 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_external_chromium-webview
04:24:42 <strcat[m]> should be done with that for now
04:24:58 <strcat[m]> also doing the Vanadium update to the new release
04:24:59 <strcat[m]> so much to do
04:25:23 <strcat[m]> so tomorrow or in the next few days when they release the Android 10 security update
04:25:31 <strcat[m]> plan is to do a final release based on that for Android 10 branch
04:25:40 <strcat[m]> along with switching over to the Android 11 kernels
04:25:51 <strcat[m]> to get the kernels shipped / tested early as a starting point
04:25:58 <strcat[m]> goal is to get the kernels ready today
04:30:29 <strcat[m]> testing Android 11 Pixel 2 kernel atm
04:30:39 <strcat[m]> need help with Pixel 3/3a and 4 still
04:34:01 <strcat[m]> I might just do a release tonight if we get the kernels done
04:34:07 <strcat[m]> before they release security patch tags
04:34:10 <strcat[m]> we'll see
04:34:13 <dan-v[m]> strcat: have you validated if prebuilt vendor works with stock 11 AOSP?
04:34:15 <strcat[m]> okay Pixel 2 kernel works
04:34:19 <strcat[m]> dan-v: no
04:34:30 <strcat[m]> I'm working on Android 11 kernels with the last Android 10 tag
04:34:38 <strcat[m]> along with porting very basic stuff to Android 11 via emulator
04:34:48 <strcat[m]> I'm not touching Android 11 device support, letting you and cdesai do that
04:34:49 <strcat[m]> and others
04:35:03 <strcat[m]> kernel stuff is not that bad so far
04:35:03 <dan-v[m]> strcat: ok, sounds good
04:35:12 <strcat[m]> Pixel 2 doesn't have many changes, 3 and 4 do
04:37:14 <strcat[m]> one thing to note is for qcacld Google applied a similar change as what I did disabling build tag
04:37:24 <strcat[m]> they backported a ton of stuff so there may be issues with other changes
04:37:27 <strcat[m]> need to figure that all out
04:41:00 <strcat[m]> this android-10.0.0_r46 tag they pushed... really fucking weird
04:41:14 <strcat[m]> it's from 2019 lol
04:41:24 <dan-v[m]> lol wtf
05:55:11 <strcat[m]> BTW
05:55:12 <strcat[m]> it's not going to impact many people
05:55:22 <strcat[m]> but if you installed GrapheneOS before the first stable release in 2019, there may be issues updating to Android 10
05:55:40 <strcat[m]> because I am not going to port the code for handling the old encryption format from before the first stable release
05:56:01 <strcat[m]> i.e. people who installed it when it was Android Hardening may be forced to factory reset
05:56:25 <strcat[m]> it would be too much work to continue supporting the old format especially since it's difficult to test
06:01:32 <strcat[m]> https://grapheneos.org/releases#2019.03.05.03
06:02:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Deletion: 100
06:02:44 <strcat[m]> installations that were made at some point before the 2019.03.05.03 release of the Android Hardening project will be forced to factory reset after updating to GrapheneOS based on Android 10
06:03:18 <strcat[m]> 2019.03.05.03 was the only tagged release under the Android Hardening name, so this only applies if you installed before there were even official releases
06:03:26 <strcat[m]> i.e. one of the early testing builds
06:03:34 <strcat[m]> if you've factory reset at any point since then it's already handled
06:04:03 <strcat[m]> I'm not willing to continue porting the backwards compatibility handling forwards and it would be far too much work to actually do a forced migration (which is why it was never done)
06:07:48 <lickidysplit[m]> Thanks strcat (=
08:07:56 <atasuke[m]> Hey I‚Äôm still having issues generating signed build. I get this ¬´¬†warning¬†¬ª https://pastebin.com/k22iYA2N
08:07:56 <atasuke[m]> The signing process complete but it must be badly signed because auditor fail at verified boot
10:53:00 <strcat[m]> atasuke: Auditor just doesn'
10:53:07 <strcat[m]>  * atasuke: Auditor just doesn't know about your keys
10:53:26 <strcat[m]> you need to fork Auditor and add your verified boot key to the database
10:53:53 <strcat[m]> and set the debug / release keys for Auditor (that it uses to verify Auditor on the other device) to the keys you use to sign Auditor
10:54:17 <strcat[m]> it won't be interoperable with the official Auditor and AttestationServer builds
10:54:25 <strcat[m]> they don't trust your keys for signing the OS or for signing Auditor
10:54:49 <strcat[m]> if you use a modified build of Auditor, it won't pass attestation, since it isn't signed with the correct keys
10:54:55 <strcat[m]> the whole point of it is that you can't trick it like that
10:55:03 <strcat[m]> you can try
10:55:05 <strcat[m]> it won't work
10:55:16 <strcat[m]> the hardware-based attestation includes the signing key of the app from the OS
10:55:20 <strcat[m]> and the signing key of the OS
10:55:48 <strcat[m]> (it gets signing key of the OS in early boot before the OS is booted up and reads persistent state)
11:00:36 <atasuke[m]> Thanks you a lot for the detailed information. This should be added to the website
11:06:45 <atasuke[m]> Is there any resources on how to run your own attestation service ?
11:06:50 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> I have tried building Vanadium trichrome before and renamed it in different package in args.gn
11:07:11 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Despite doing so, I can't install the apk in an official GrapheneOS phone
11:08:05 <cn3m[m]> @d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.org: the apk needs the library apk installed first
11:08:13 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <cn3m[m] "@d64qoc8432li8p9ouijtv:matrix.or"> I did that
11:08:16 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Even in adb
11:08:21 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> But some error came
11:08:24 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Gotta check later
11:09:14 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Library -> Chrome apk
11:09:41 <strcat[m]> testing Android 11 kernel for Pixel 3 atm
11:10:05 <strcat[m]> atasuke: it's covered in the attestation server README
11:10:33 <strcat[m]> atasuke: server needs the same adjustments: add your verified boot key and perhaps give the OS a name like GrapheneOS (atasuke's build) for the database
11:10:52 <strcat[m]> atasuke: and set the keysit checks for Auditor to your debug / release keys
11:10:59 <strcat[m]>  * atasuke: and set the keys it checks for Auditor to your debug / release keys
11:11:14 <strcat[m]> then you can just launch it on the server - you only need to do setup to configure it being able to send emails
11:11:42 * d64qoc8432li8p9o sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NVgiadpegidhsitUtplsQUsf/message.txt >

11:16:26 <atasuke[m]> strcat: thanks you but where do I add the keys in the app and server ? Where is the database ?
11:20:19 <kmart> Guys, I'm looking for a developer that could port graphene to a device I'm working with. Will pay of course
11:20:52 <kmart> I do have sources (AOSP) for that device, so shouldnt be too hard I Guess?
11:22:02 <cn3m[m]> kmart: https://grapheneos.org/faq#future-devices The expectation is you buy a device for GrapheneOS. The issue is that other devices don't meet the standards of the project otherwise they likely would be supported or at least considered
11:22:15 <cn3m[m]> if it doesn't meet the criteria it is not GrapheneOS
11:24:42 <kmart> This device wont be used for any kind of media playback, deleted the TZ truslets for that, as they are full of bugs usually, No need BT or NFC, browser or google store to install crapware. I think I can be made secure
11:26:10 <blacklight447[m]> <strcat[m] "testing Android 11 kernel for Pi"> The hero we don't deserve, but the hero we need
11:26:44 <strcat[m]> atasuke: in AttestationProtocol.java
11:26:48 <strcat[m]> look at commits adding devices
11:27:04 <atasuke[m]> strcat: ok thanks a lot
11:27:42 <kmart> cn3m[m]: its why I said I would pay for this anyway, I understand that some devices are better targets for this, but I really want soemthing more secure than a basic AOSP code
11:28:09 <cn3m[m]> <kmart "cn3m: its why I said I would pay"> you are better with a locked bootloader
11:28:40 <kmart> the bootloader will be locked, I woen full license of the code, and will write my own root key to them
11:28:50 <kmart> own*
11:30:29 <Ultron[m]> kmart: Which device you got if you don't mind sharing?
11:31:29 <kmart> and while I am busy rewriting the entire boot chain up to the point kernel is booted (scrapped the MTK code of that part), I would prefer to replace the upper part with something better than AOSP
11:32:33 <kmart> its an unbranded ODM device manufactured in china of course :) but at least I have all the source
11:32:37 <Ultron[m]> Why not just buy a supported device?
11:33:13 <kmart> because then I wont be able to rewrite the bootchain, incl, WiFi FW and cellular modem fw?
11:34:09 <kmart> I understand all Graphene devices use modem/wifi fw blobs as they are, with all the bugs
11:34:15 <Ultron[m]> Okay. But I have not heard good things about the Mediatek SOCs.
11:34:38 <kmart> the SoCs are fine honestly, its the code that has a backdoor within a backdoor
11:34:38 <Ultron[m]> <kmart "I understand all Graphene device"> They are isolated.
11:35:11 <kmart> isolated how?
11:35:21 <cn3m[m]> I am going to have to ask you to switch to offtopic chat. This has nothing to do with GrapheneOS and I can't see this device being supported
11:37:06 <inrdrna[m]> lmfao
11:37:45 <inrdrna[m]> "unbranded ODM" :curi
11:37:49 <inrdrna[m]>  * "unbranded ODM" :curious:
11:38:25 <kmart> No stress cn3m[m], just noting the reason why not grapheneOS-device, because I cant upgrade other parts of the FW on those. And AFAIK, aside from one custom phone form kickstarter, no retail devices have the modem isolated in a real way, they all share some memory and are vulnerable to modem->kernel exploitations
11:38:57 <kmart> inrdrna[m], yes, look it up, you have to order like 5000 units, pay source code fee and you can start your own phone project
11:39:08 <cn3m[m]> yeah no
11:39:16 <cn3m[m]> iPhones have been doing that for years very well
11:39:25 <cn3m[m]> and lately Pixels have been doing just as well
11:39:31 <cn3m[m]> IOMMU can and does work
11:39:52 <cn3m[m]> also MTK is absolutely shit at handling security issues
11:39:59 <cn3m[m]> remember the root exploit for the kindle?
11:40:08 <cn3m[m]> that effected every MTK chip
11:40:12 <cn3m[m]> after a year of not patching
11:40:23 <cn3m[m]> Google said fuck it and mitigated it themselves
11:40:32 <cn3m[m]> Google doesn't do that!
11:40:50 <kmart> sure, I know those issues, and many many more, every piece of boot chain has tons of bugs that are still unpatched to this day
11:41:36 <kmart> while preparing to this project I must have found like 10 different ways to bypass secure boot on MTK
11:42:03 <kmart> incl. unpatchable romcode bugs
11:42:20 <kmart> but that isnt an issue
11:42:29 <cn3m[m]> Save yourself the time and effort and buy a device every few years and don't worry about upgrades
11:42:34 <kmart> since I scrapped all that code and rewrite it from scratch
11:42:39 <cn3m[m]> it is not worth anyone's time
11:43:21 <kmart> cn3m[m], I'm making my own phone bruh :P I'm not here to upgrade my personal device or somthing
11:43:32 <cn3m[m]> that is assuming your code is flawless which is a huge assumption. Again if this could be moved to the offtopic chat I would apperciate that
11:45:49 <kmart> well, then back to the core issue at hand - I would like to swap the AOSP delivered within the deal, with soemthing else, preferably GrapheneOS
11:46:13 <kmart> and I would pay for this -- thats about it
11:46:47 <cn3m[m]> "/join #grapheneos-offtopic"
11:47:05 <kmart> but thats on the graphene topic, isnt it ?
11:47:12 <kmart> device porting topic
12:01:12 <cn3m[m]> kmart: to supported devices
12:01:13 <cn3m[m]> that is not a supported device
12:07:02 <kmart> thx for the clarification :P
12:14:05 <cn3m[m]> kmart: yeah if a device is going to meet the criteria of the project then it is on topic
12:16:58 <kmart> well it would be hard to judge that, as in the end the device will be indeed on the MTK chip but will run little to none of actual MTK code
12:21:44 <cn3m[m]> you have the criteria
12:21:53 <cn3m[m]> make your case why it meets every point of it
13:42:53 <derpy> anyone use m.uber.com on graphene?
13:43:24 <derpy> As far as I can tell it doesn't allow one to add stops or change destination... Maybe there's a way to use the app without google services?
13:43:31 <derpy> or another work around I don't see?
13:50:38 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> <derpy "anyone use m.uber.com on graphen"> Try using desktop mode?
13:50:39 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> Not sure
15:30:00 <derpy> d64qoc8432li8p9o I made a support ticket with them... Doubt they'll be helpful though
15:30:09 <derpy> No way to do using uber.com or m.uber.com
15:31:35 <jpds> I really doubt Uber will work without Google MAps
15:44:36 <alzxjm[m]> Not sure about adding stops or changing destination but m.uber.com seems to work OK for requesting a ride.
15:44:59 <alzxjm[m]> (I'm on CalyxOS w/microG disabled so this might not be 100% comparable to Graphene, but it seems to work OK)
15:58:40 <leonidas164[m]> <derpy "anyone use m.uber.com on graphen"> adsfasf: so far i doesn't work at all. Same goes for most mobility apps of course
16:44:31 <strcat[m]> btw I would greatly appreciate if people could send more PayPal and GitHub Sponsors donations to help cover the costs of defending the project
16:44:54 <strcat[m]> legal fees for defending against the BS lawsuit filed against the project and for filing our own lawsuits are very expensive
16:45:11 <strcat[m]> I'm going to be primarily using Bitcoin donations for funding other developers
16:45:27 <strcat[m]> been using PayPal to cover legal fees and it's entirely out atm
16:45:34 <strcat[m]> it's ~2k/month, need more donations
16:46:15 <strcat[m]> atm Bitcoin -> being used to fund other developers and hardware for them, PayPal -> legal fees, server costs, domain registration costs, GitHub Sponsors -> my income
16:46:26 <strcat[m]> not 100% but that's approximately how it's used
16:47:24 <strcat[m]> this way I don't need to deal with handling the complexity of capital gains on Bitcoin as income since the project isn't for me atm, keeps things simpler
16:48:06 <strcat[m]> a site that had my credit card info was compromised and my bank hasn't sent the replacement yet so I have to use PayPal to pay for stuff atm which is really annoying, had to move over various recurring payments to it and deal with hassle beyond that
16:48:31 <strcat[m]> they gave me a new number but didn't send the card, they fucked up somehow, really annoying, been a month since I can conveniently pay for stuff
16:48:51 <strcat[m]> and I had a backup card that's unused but they never sent a replacement when it naturally expired, good stuff
16:49:17 <strcat[m]> and they aren't responding to my messages via their site atm, and they won't give me a number for calling them about this, the regular credit card number is 'disputes' and they won't deal with it
16:49:42 <strcat[m]> I only need it so I can easily pay for stuff, I don't run a balance on it
16:50:27 <strcat[m]> so like atm OVH payments for GrapheneOS, domain registration and all my personal bills had to be moved to paypal or getting someone else to pay for it with a credit card and sending them cash
16:50:31 <strcat[m]> super annoying
16:51:01 <strcat[m]> banks always causing me problems
16:51:11 <strcat[m]> how hard it is to just send something in the mail?
16:51:50 <ThomCat[m]> strcat lawsuit is in US or Canada?
16:54:10 <strcat[m]> Canada
16:54:45 <strcat[m]> PayPal is the easiest way to pay those invoices right now so I'd appreciate if people can donate via PayPal, I need a lot more than I'm getting right now
16:55:17 <strcat[m]> I can pay via eTransfers or a credit card - but I haven't received either of the new renewed credit cards in the mail due to some bureaucratic problem
16:55:26 <strcat[m]> and eTransfers are a real hassle
16:55:35 <strcat[m]> so I guess I could start withdrawing money from my bank account into PayPal
16:55:51 <strcat[m]> it would be nice if donations would cover these ongoing substantial costs though
16:55:59 <strcat[m]> in order to continue development I really need these costs covered
16:56:09 <strcat[m]> not getting enough donations recently
16:56:39 <strcat[m]> I also want to start paying other developers so they can spend more time on the project so the BTC will start being used up for that
17:05:54 <ThomCat[m]> Would you take venture capital money if someone could find a firm willing to 'invest'?
17:07:23 <ThomCat[m]> [(i.e. how Matrix.org raised some money last year)](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/10/10/new-vector-raises-8-5-m-to-accelerate-matrix-riot-modular)
17:18:21 <Lallerz> hello
17:19:11 <atasuke[m]> Hello
17:19:45 <Lallerz> after having found netflix.service, amazon.service amazon.apphandler facebook.manager and tons of analytics packages on my damned xiaomi, I decided to choose other. That's the short story why I am here
17:21:16 <Lallerz> and I am pleased to find such a populated chan, wow
17:24:35 <jcpicard32[m]> Welcome!
17:25:06 <Lallerz> and, may I ask if the next release will support the pixel 4a ?
17:41:42 <githerazi[m]> <Lallerz "and, may I ask if the next relea"> Yes. Yes you may ask.
17:41:57 <Lallerz> Thanks
17:42:21 <Lallerz> will the next release support the pixel 4a ?
18:00:17 <derpy> you guys have an auto-updater for F-Droid? Or you always do them manually by clicking 'install' on each app?
18:14:31 <Nikos[m]> <derpy "you guys have an auto-updater fo"> For auto update functionality you need the f-droid privileged extension (because that functionality requires system access). It s not included in GrapheneOS though.
18:15:26 <derpy> Do people in this community generally use & trust it (the priviledged extension)?
18:15:38 <ThomCat[m]>  * @strcat Would you take venture capital money if someone could find a firm willing to 'invest'?
18:16:42 <cn3m[m]> <derpy "Do people in this community gene"> no it is not supported(due to blindly trusting 3rd party repos) and needing root
18:16:53 <derpy> ok
18:17:12 <derpy> will just click with the ol fingers for now :)
18:17:20 <fll[m]> <Lallerz "will the next release support th"> That will probably take some time, since the phone is not even out yet and someone needs to step up to be the maintainer of the 4a
18:18:51 <Lallerz> thanks for the reply
19:19:12 <lev[m]> I've dug around a bit in the logs and didn't really find anything definitive, but: what are people's thoughts on using biometrics (particularly the fingerprint reader) ?
19:19:38 <lev[m]> it seems like it's viewed favorably, but it seems like having that sort of data recorded would be a risk to the user
19:20:24 <lev[m]> I assume that data is never transmitted at all, and should be hard to access by apps that aren't meant to access it?
19:21:49 <jpds> lev[m]: The biometric data is stored in the Titan M security chip
19:22:57 <cn3m[m]> stored fuzzy not evn google or grapheneos can reverse it
19:24:32 <lev[m]> what about the hardware itself?  would it be impossible to intercept data being reported from a 'read' ?
19:27:17 <cn3m[m]> your camera would be a much easier method
19:28:13 <cn3m[m]> I don't know if they are using encrypted memory or what(the SEP does for TouchID), but at some point the effort required to man in the middle the fingerprint sensor would be really high
19:29:50 <BalooRJ> is there a way to use only biometric and not have to use the pin or a password? Or can they only be used in tandem
19:30:10 <cn3m[m]> just use a 4 digit PIN
19:30:26 <cn3m[m]> if it is truly random it would take roughly 650 years to bruteforce
19:30:45 <cn3m[m]> the fingerprint times out after 48 hours
19:30:50 <BalooRJ> good to know.
19:31:01 <cn3m[m]> so making a fake in that time would prove challenging if it was stolen
19:31:12 <lev[m]> or if you restart
19:31:22 <cn3m[m]> sure
19:31:30 <lev[m]> so if you're nabbed, restarting the phone is a good move
19:31:46 <cn3m[m]> yes, especially for AFU avoid lockdown
19:34:53 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4 with IR scanner + a good length truly random PIN + practicing a fast restart is probably the ideal setup
19:35:14 <cn3m[m]> shoulder surfing and CCTV are dead in the water since you don't enter your password often
19:35:56 <lev[m]> it's also depends on when you restart though, to be fair
19:36:12 <atasuke[m]> If my device is stolen and I couldn‚Äôt reboot. Is the data at risk ?
19:36:16 <lev[m]> if you get picked up, and instantly restart, you'll probably turn your phone back on to look up a number unless you have your emergency contact memorized
19:36:23 <lev[m]> at which point you'll definitely enter it in, while on camera
19:36:56 <cn3m[m]> <atasuke[m] "If my device is stolen and I cou"> um, not really
19:37:06 <cn3m[m]> the 48 hour timeout on biometrics is good enough
19:37:19 <cn3m[m]> and AFU is tricky on GrapheneOS
19:38:35 <atasuke[m]> Ok
19:38:43 <cn3m[m]> people know they are going to have to deal with no usb attack vector and layers upon layers of hardening on iOS. On a Pixel that may come as a real shock to see you also have that here. Not to advocate security through obscurity at all, but yeah
19:38:54 <salbutamol[m]> emergency contact number on the lockscreen sounds like a wise move
19:39:01 <cn3m[m]> Pixel with GrapheneOS is pretty tough
19:39:12 <atasuke[m]> Dope
19:40:18 <atasuke[m]> Just an idea, why isn‚Äôt there a way to wipe the phone after a number of failed password attempts ?
19:41:05 <cn3m[m]> I really don't think that is a necessary
19:42:08 <cn3m[m]> You can already junk a Pixel effectively by trying to unlock it too many times(a DOS basically) an iPhone has this feature since the timeouts are shorter(but the minimum PIN is far far longer)
19:42:19 <cn3m[m]> so if you want for instance to use an iPhone with a 4 digit PIN
19:42:49 <cn3m[m]> it is meant for a 6 digit PIN so it wouldn't be as strong as a Pixel 4 PIN vs 4 PIN
19:43:12 <cn3m[m]> an iPhone with 4 digit PIN and the 10 tries makes some more sense there
19:43:52 <salbutamol[m]> there's a program on FDroid called Wrong PIN Shutdown which will turn off your device after X retries if that gives you some peace of mind
19:44:29 <cn3m[m]> not recommended
19:44:31 <salbutamol[m]> oh no?
19:45:11 <atasuke[m]> salbutamol: you have to register the app as a device admin which is not really good
19:45:13 <cn3m[m]> device manager
19:45:17 <cn3m[m]> and correction
19:45:31 <cn3m[m]> the time out on Pixels is not as aggressive as I remember
19:45:38 <cn3m[m]> it is pretty hard to disable the device
19:45:48 <cn3m[m]> but still it is very strong
19:45:50 <salbutamol[m]> oic - what's the risk there, that the app could be shady / exploited?
19:46:03 <atasuke[m]> Yes shady
19:46:04 <cn3m[m]> yes
19:46:19 <cn3m[m]> if it was exploited it would have full ownership of your profile
19:46:39 <salbutamol[m]> gotcha
19:47:27 <lev[m]> huh, apparently pixel 4/xl are already out of stock, and not available from google any more
19:47:59 <cn3m[m]> in general the iPhone system is not as refined. Requires 6 digit PINs(which are long, but less likely to be easily guessed), shorter timeouts(which can be nice), but the wipe after failed attempts only make sense if you have a bad PIN imo
19:48:08 <cn3m[m]> it opens you up to more damage if someone wipes your phone
19:48:28 <cn3m[m]> than expecting someone to guess your nigh unbreakable PIN(on either phone)
19:48:37 <cn3m[m]> if someone did bypass the hardware timer
19:48:49 <cn3m[m]> they would bypass the wipe limit too
19:48:54 <echotunnelriver[> Does Graphene have a pin scramble feature? I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere.
19:49:01 <cn3m[m]> though a hardware timer bypass is extremely unlikely
19:49:04 <cn3m[m]> <echotunnelriver[ "Does Graphene have a pin scrambl"> it does
19:51:10 <cn3m[m]> basically if you PIN is 1234 iPhone will protect you by at least making it longer. People don't really carry 6 digit easily guessable combos in their head like SSN, birthday(you could add year though), and years like 1787. iPhones with the wipe after 10(optional) makes it way more appealing if you have a really bad PIN
19:51:54 <cn3m[m]> Pixels on the other hand the 4 digit PIN makes more sense if you have it fully random it will be very strong and you don't need to worry about data loss and on top of it the PIN is shorter
19:53:53 <nickcalyx[m]> > Does Graphene have a pin scramble feature? I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere.
19:53:53 <nickcalyx[m]> Do you mean rearranging the keypad?
19:54:16 <jpds> Yeah, it's in the settings, somewhere
19:55:02 <atasuke[m]> <cn3m[m] "in general the iPhone system is "> iPhone doesn‚Äôt require 6 pin
19:55:20 <cn3m[m]> I mean you can set it to 4 if you customize it
19:55:28 <cn3m[m]> but the default PIN is set to 6

20:30:45 <derpy> https://www.davx5.com/tested-with jeez they should at least recommend some top ones they know function well... paradox of choice!
20:32:30 <derpy> just spent over an hour trying to move a damn address book... I don't see how this could possibly be a recommended app; such a waste of time.
20:32:45 <derpy> Is there an android function where you can import / export just the address book to grapheneOS?
20:32:58 <derpy> DAVx5 is way overcomplicated
20:33:34 <Autopsy[m]> FastMail works flawlessly. It's not complicated. Anyways, is off topic, my man.

22:22:57 <jpds> adeus[m]: No
22:59:11 <KE0VVT> Last time I bought a device with the hopes of putting a custom OS on it, the bootloader was locked and the radio was not supported. I just want to buy something that will definitely work with GrapheneOS.
22:59:54 <KE0VVT> (I bought a Galaxy Nexus. Little did I know, it‚Äôs a different piece of hardware when you get it from Verizon, and few ROMs supported it.)
23:20:56 <nickcalyx[m]> > Hey I heard that the next update will force some people to do a factory reset ???
23:20:56 <nickcalyx[m]> Where did you hear that
23:21:37 <d64qoc8432li8p9o> It depends on what version you first flashed the OS and if you factory reset after some update
23:41:54 <strcat[m]> only people who installed GrapheneOS before it was called GrapheneOS
23:42:00 <strcat[m]> and before the first Android Hardening stable release
23:42:14 <strcat[m]> i.e. people who installed before https://grapheneos.org/releases#2019.03.05.03
23:42:18 <strcat[m]> I was very clear about that
23:42:19 <dazinism> KE0VVT: its still the same, dong buy a Verizon Pixel as the bootloader can not be unlocked
23:42:40 <dazinism> *dont buy a
