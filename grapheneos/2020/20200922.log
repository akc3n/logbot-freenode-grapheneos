00:06:14 <fomijafi[m]> So currently, fingerprint does not work in apps, only screen unlock. Is that a setting that I'm missing, or something that hasn't been implemented in the android 11 build for pixel 3?
00:10:09 <nickcalyx[m]> > Is it hard to get the IMEI changed with a Pixel 4?
00:10:09 <nickcalyx[m]> If you figure out how please let.me.know
00:11:57 <cn3m[m]> !mjolnir watch #ptio-friends-bl:privacytools.io
00:12:33 <jonah__> cn3m: that won't work lol
00:12:43 <cn3m[m]> Jonah: ah thanks
00:12:48 <cn3m[m]> you're quick
00:13:43 <jonah__> dngray must be talking to you lol
00:14:01 <dngray> lol true
01:13:27 <strcat[m]> fomijafi: the next Android 11 release fixes biometric support
01:13:37 <strcat[m]> we're waiting to get some other things fixed
01:15:07 <fomijafi[m]> Cool. Just wanted to check in to make sure other people had reported or whether I should put something on the issue tracker
01:37:59 <KE0VVT> I went ahead and got the 4a and will be waiting however long it takes to get a port for it. I will be donating $60Â USD at some point.
01:48:04 <brockin042[m]> Anybody using seedvault backup on USB stick? I don't recall ever getting a 12 word password to decrypt a backup.
02:45:05 <Quan7um> <brockin042[m] "Anybody using seedvault backup o"> When you select the backup option, the first thing it'll do is provide the 12 words. You must have clicked past the screen.
03:14:48 <Lia[m]> Also, you can clear data to Seedvault app to generate new 12 words and make new backup too
03:19:25 <brockin042[m]> Lia: appreciate it, I deleted data from app. Now I see password to write down.
03:57:57 <jin29> Hello grapheneos community,Thank you for the work that you do. I'm very happy to have found something that can help respecting my basic human rights like privacy from something as crucial as a smartphone. In my case I have a special need for this as I am being harassed by private investigators from a bitter ex family member. I installed grapheneos
03:57:57 <jin29> on pixel 4 on my PC using my wifi. However I have recently discovered my home WiFi has been compromised and that they may have had access to my laptop. This is a large investigative firm with vast resources and she's spending a ton of money trying to make my life miserable. Anyways, I am a script kiddie that just knows how to follow instructions. I
03:57:58 <jin29> probably should have tried to verify the download but I installed this in a hurry. If the attacker had access to my laptop and WiFi could they have compromised my download and planted something during the process? Sorry for my ignorance and I appreciate any help I can get.

04:08:12 <lickidysplit-pti> Use auditor on another device
04:08:24 <lickidysplit-pti> Or not. Just keep joining & leaving.
04:09:46 <lickidysplit-pti> Saleh. Use auditor from another device to verify the intigredy of the OS install
04:18:15 <parker> Hi I'm looking for a way to audit my grapheneos as I believe the laptop and wifi I was using was compromised
04:18:55 <parker> Looking for someone to point me in the right direction as I'm a complete newbie
04:23:39 <deetot> Any idea who compromised it
04:23:45 <deetot> Or just worried
04:24:16 <parker> Shady investigative firm
04:24:53 <parker> Very resourceful. Cracked my iOS and android phones in the past
04:25:12 <parker> IPhone 11 and galaxy s9 both broken into almost right away
04:25:18 <deetot> That's my I'm a proponent of only using wired. WiFi can never be trusted
04:25:50 <deetot> Only thing I know of is the grapheme audit app
04:25:59 <aeonsolution[m]> get a new laptop and flash grapheneos again and use the auditor
04:26:05 <deetot> * Only thing I know of is the graphene audit app
04:26:26 <parker> Problem is I'm being tailed by these guys so I can't use public WiFi
04:26:40 <aeonsolution[m]> you need to pay for forensics and research analysts to figure out if you are compromised otherwise
04:26:42 <parker> Obtaining the file would be difficult
04:26:59 <aeonsolution[m]> those are really your only options im afraid
04:27:16 <aeonsolution[m]> if you flash grapheneos on a compromised computer
04:27:47 <deetot> Stop using internet all together for a bit and see what they do
04:28:00 <parker> They just follow me
04:28:20 <parker> Acting skills aren't as good as their hacking skillsb
04:28:20 <aeonsolution[m]> again, just get a new laptop and flash it again
04:28:37 <parker> Yeah I need to find a way to do that without being tailed
04:28:57 <aeonsolution[m]> then use auditor
04:29:04 <parker> The auditor app doss that require two phones with grapheneos?
04:29:38 <aeonsolution[m]> https://attestation.app/tutorial
04:30:10 <parker> OK thank you very much I will read into it.
04:30:19 <parker> I'm glad this community is so helpful
04:30:34 <aeonsolution[m]> you're welcome. good luck.
05:07:19 <Lia[m]> Can't reproduce gallery app crashing when cropping
05:09:35 <Lia[m]> Oh, it was on edit button
05:09:39 <Lia[m]> Just reproduced it
06:37:26 <ham5urg_> strcat[m], if IMEI is not changeable this must be a fraud: https://www.movical.net/us-en/repair/google/pixel-4
06:40:48 <null[m]> That page mentions restoring original IMEI, under both "Repair IMEI" and "Change IMEI"
06:40:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> [ham5urg_](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_ham5urg_:matrix.org): imei is changeable
06:41:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> Find a way under stock ROM to set USB mode to diag
06:41:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> It will most likely only work on stock and if they implemented it
06:45:47 <lickidysplit-pti> What's with everyone thinking they're being gang stalked
06:46:10 <lickidysplit-pti> I get covid has fucked our mental health but cmon lol
06:46:30 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "What's with everyone thinking th"> Their in a gang now :P
06:46:41 <ham5urg_> Quite an investment for a test, I still did not bought an Pixel4. I hoped to find someone who can confirm or deny the possibility.
06:46:50 <lickidysplit-pti> Its just a term lol
06:47:57 <lickidysplit-pti> <ham5urg_ "Quite an investment for a test, "> It can be done, but its illegal and too time costly to implement such thing
06:48:56 <ham5urg_> anupritaisno1[m], why is it illegal?
06:49:55 <ham5urg_> Apple just implemented a MAC randomization for wifi. This is not illegal?
06:50:59 <ham5urg_> Found this script, looks good. Is this illegal too?
06:51:06 <ham5urg_> https://usmile.at/blog/how-to-change-imei-on-android-devices
06:51:21 <lickidysplit-pti> Because some countries are sissy countries hahahaa
06:51:31 <lickidysplit-pti> The UK for example
06:51:36 <lickidysplit-pti> Not in all countries tho
06:52:13 <lickidysplit-pti> But the devs have spoken on this with Me already and they are not going to be implementing it anytime soon
06:53:35 <lickidysplit-pti> I offered 500 aud and another member said he would match, so money isn't an issue. I think its more so the time and other stuff they have already going on
06:53:59 <lickidysplit-pti> Fixing bugs in the OS itself etc.
06:54:16 <JTL> I think the concern is fraud, (i.e steal a phone, original owner gets the IMEI blacklisted, and the thief changes the IMEI thus using a stolen phone)
06:54:33 <ham5urg_> A confirmed shell-howto like the one I posted before is good for me.
06:54:53 <ham5urg_> I don't want to change the IMEI more than once.
06:55:30 <lickidysplit-pti> <ham5urg_ "Apple just implemented a MAC ran"> Graphene has this as default
06:56:08 <ham5urg_> lickidysplit-pti, yes.
06:56:28 <lickidysplit-pti> Mac WiFi and imei are too different things
06:57:05 <ham5urg_> I know, but they have simillar concepts.
06:57:42 <ham5urg_> What about Bluetooth Mac? Is it randomized too?
06:57:44 <lickidysplit-pti> I'm aware. U can change imei very easy with root. But that breaks gos security
06:58:30 <lickidysplit-pti> <ham5urg_ "What about Bluetooth Mac? Is it "> I don't believe so
06:58:34 <cn3m[m]> yes
06:58:43 <lickidysplit-pti> Well I was wrong
06:58:57 <null[m]> Doesnt that mean having to re-do the pairing every time you connect to a BT device?
06:59:25 <lickidysplit-pti> <null[m] "Doesnt that mean having to re-do"> I don't experience this.
06:59:53 <lickidysplit-pti> Auto connects to my car unit, portable speaker etc.
07:00:59 <cn3m[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200603#c4044205
07:01:11 <cn3m[m]> "Bluetooth has MAC randomization as part of the spec"
07:01:35 <cn3m[m]> "unlike Wi-Fi, privacy is standard in the Bluetooth LE spec"
07:02:40 <ham5urg_> That is good and makes life easier.
07:02:42 <lickidysplit-pti> if you are only using Bluetooth like Wi-Fi and removing pairings then the privacy is comparable to Wi-Fi privacy
07:11:26 <ham5urg_> Is it possible to get root-access to a GrapheneOS-device without breaking it? To get adb and fastboot work.
07:12:31 <renlord> ham5urg_: what are you trying to do
07:13:45 <ham5urg_> renlord, to get my old IMEI into a Pixel4.
07:15:23 <lickidysplit-pti> Your old imei???? Why would u wanna do that
07:15:54 <lickidysplit-pti> Did u change it before installing GoS and now carrier won't work?
07:16:33 <lickidysplit-pti> Only way to change it would be to flash stock - root / reinstate your old imei and reflash GoS :/
07:17:13 <iandeb[m]> What's happened to the off topic room?
07:17:33 <lickidysplit-pti> #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
07:17:52 <lickidysplit-pti> Still there for me
07:18:34 <ham5urg_> Sorry, did not know about the offtopic channel. I will switch to it.
07:21:43 <iandeb[m]> Thanks.  I somehow dropped out.
09:40:34 <EEE> can this be used on a supported device and connected to a large screen to act as a tv box? it wont be android tv interface i dont think, but at least an android interface on a large screen? maybe using rf remote/keyboard? rf keyboard is ideal, but ir or other ideas you may have (bluetooth is last resort)
09:45:32 <lickidysplit-pti> If your devices supports HDMI out I think so.
09:48:44 <alzxjm[m]> <lickidysplit-pti "If your devices supports HDMI ou"> Which Pixels do not, unfortunately. Stupid Google removed Miracast support, too.
09:48:51 <alzxjm[m]> You have to use Chromecast.
10:06:11 <lickidysplit-pti> The hardware is there. The software is not
10:10:05 <EEE> i wonder if miracast was removed for secu reasons...its a source of data leak perhaps...or maybe they're just extending and extinguishing ala msft
10:12:52 <EEE> also there are plenty of tv boxes, some of which work with both android and linux like pine64...would getting gos on there be as simple as recompiling kernel with firmware specific to that board, putting dtb files and recreating an iso? or maybe even just using the dtb+kernel+drivers+firmware of the android images for those boards, while putting gos userspace there? how modded is gos kernel/firmware/lowlevel?
10:13:57 <cn3m[m]> EEE: GrapheneOS has development support for the hikey boards
10:15:09 <EEE> pine64-lts using allwinner a64 is particularly good contender as there are many other form factors using the a64 chip and also it doesnt require raminit blob, apparently there is a fix for the cpu bug
10:16:08 <cn3m[m]> the issue is these devices can't officially be supported beyond test targets due to lacking hardware security features
10:50:27 <creigh[m]> So I lost my beloved Pixel 3a running Graphene OS but it was returned to lost & found and I'll get it back tomorrow. I know the odds are astronomical that somebody tampered with the device. Correct me if I'm wrong but there's two options basically:
10:50:27 <creigh[m]> 1. Somebody modified the bootloader. I would see that easily because of "verified boot".
10:50:27 <creigh[m]> 2. Somebody brute-forced my 4-digit PIN. How could I verify this didn't happen? Is there any system logs I could inspect regarding authentication attempts?

11:28:36 <deetot> I hope you at least have it setup so you can enter pins more than 4 digits when entering a pin
11:36:30 <louipc> how many? 16?
11:43:47 <bobfett> I have a question: is this expected behavior that once you were not able to unlock with fingerprint it is locked until you reboot the device or not?
11:43:47 <bobfett> If not, is this bug solved with the fix to biometrics in the development build? I have no possibility to factory reset my device.
11:43:47 <bobfett> I am on pixel 3xl if it helps or change something

11:54:04 <louipc> im not sure if its time, or activity based exactly
11:54:16 <louipc> but pin will be required if theres too many bad fingerprint attempts
12:03:21 <bobfett> When I enter my passphrase, the fingerprint unlock is still locked. The only way to enable it again is to reboot, put my passphrase and then I am able to unlock it with fingerprints again

12:07:57 <louipc> oh i dunno
12:16:02 <renex> A question, would it be possible to setup the phone so that if it is unlocked in the presence of a specific bluetooth device it would stay unlocked (even if the screen goes blank) as long as the specified bluetooth device is nearby?
13:02:18 <Beaver52> @renex correct me if im wrong, but didn't android have that under "smart lock" in previous versions?
13:02:48 <Beaver52> but did smart lock get phased out?
13:05:43 <renex> Don't know, can't find anything relevant in Settings. There is a something called Trust agents, but it is empty
13:07:52 <Beaver52> smart lock was the only thing I knew of that did exactly what you want, sorry.
13:08:26 <null[m]> I recall smart lock too
13:08:51 <null[m]> Maybe it requires play services
13:13:09 <Beaver52> might be.
13:13:27 <Beaver52> an old device of mine running android 9 with play services has smart lock feature.
13:21:37 <alzxjm[m]> I doubt there are many Google Fi users here but, after another go at it, I think I can say that Google Fi does not work on GrapheneOS.
13:21:49 <alzxjm[m]> Phone calls work for a while, and seemingly after reboots, but after a while incoming calls do not work.
13:22:04 <alzxjm[m]> Other things like visual voicemail and receiving MMS are always broken.
13:22:17 <alzxjm[m]> Again, not unexpected. But I would caution against even trying.
13:24:11 <strcat> lickidysplit-pti: ham5urg_: there isn't a way to change the IMEI with root access, or with fastboot, you're posting incorrect information
13:24:35 <strcat> in general, modern basebands do not allow changing it, due to regulations forbidding that
13:25:23 <strcat> a blog post from 2015 (over 5 years ago) about an HTC phone substantially older than the post itself is not going to help you
13:25:39 <strcat> you're posting info about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_One_(M7)
13:25:44 <strcat> it has no relevance anymore
13:28:36 <genghiz> I'll be changing a 5-year-old iPhone 7 next year for a new phone. In general, would I get a good phone experience with Graphene in case I install it on, say, a hypothetical Pixel 5(a) when it comes out next year?
13:29:21 <genghiz> Mostly that boils down to will I be able to use apps like Uber, Grubhub etc.? Are they available on F-Droid?
13:29:37 <genghiz> And can they work without Play Services?
13:30:11 <strcat[m]> you can install apps from the Play store with Aurora Store, the standard F-Droid repository only has open source apps
13:30:15 <cwecw2d323de32d3> hi, i did a development build with no keys, which i just want to install on my testing device. Where can i find the img file to use?
13:30:45 <strcat[m]> genghiz: many apps will work without Play services, others won't
13:30:54 <strcat[m]> consider using web sites instead when they won't
13:31:01 <genghiz> You mean PWAs?
13:31:08 <louipc> web apps
13:31:21 <genghiz> Yeah. Progressive Web Apps.
13:31:38 <louipc> whats the diff between that and a normal web app
13:31:56 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: `out/target/product/$DEVICE/`
13:32:11 <genghiz> I dunno. I thought all web apps these days were PWAs
13:32:21 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: up to you to make sure to flash all the images and firmware if you're doing it that way (the quick development cycle)
13:32:22 <genghiz> PWAs utilise service workers.
13:32:34 <genghiz> I don't think any normal web app is bound to do so.
13:32:37 <louipc> yikes
13:33:00 <cwecw2d323de32d3> is it system.img ?
13:33:05 <cwecw2d323de32d3> seems so =)  thx
13:33:07 <genghiz> Why the yikes?
13:38:37 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: no
13:38:44 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: you need to flash all the firmware and OS images
13:38:48 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: not 1
13:39:37 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: when you do a signed build per the instructions, it generates a factory images bundle with all the images and a script to flash them for you
13:39:45 <strcat[m]> since you're doing it by hand, you need to know what to flash
13:40:55 <strcat[m]> first of all you need to flash radio and bootloader firmware partitions to make sure those are all the correct version (and then you don't need to flash them when doing further development builds until they change again)
13:41:19 <strcat[m]> you need to flash all the OS partitions and flash them again when they change / keep them in sync
13:42:12 <strcat[m]> initially, super, vbmeta, boot, dtbo, vbmeta, vendor, vbmeta_system, system, product
13:42:47 <strcat[m]> if you're doing things with development builds and flashing manually you need to know what to flash and when
13:43:10 <strcat[m]> just do a signed build + use factory images if you don't want to deal with that
13:45:46 <cwecw2d323de32d3> ok please bear with me, all i did was pressing m and enter. then after some hours it said build process complete
13:46:18 <cwecw2d323de32d3> so the next step would be : Generating signed factory images and full update packages
13:46:18 <cwecw2d323de32d3> ?
13:46:31 <strcat[m]> no
13:46:55 <cwecw2d323de32d3> i need my phone connected and flash the bootloader firmware right
13:47:02 <cwecw2d323de32d3> using adb tools
13:47:29 <strcat[m]> did you source envsetup.sh and used choosecombo, etc?
13:47:44 <strcat[m]> in the same shell
13:48:01 <cwecw2d323de32d3> yes i went trough these steps @ Setting up the OS build environment
13:48:18 <cwecw2d323de32d3> it chose the default settings
13:48:24 <cwecw2d323de32d3> i think it was user
13:54:48 <cwecw2d323de32d3> the bootloader on my device is unlocked too
13:56:08 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: what exactly are you trying to do?
13:56:12 <strcat[m]> development builds solely for testing?
13:56:26 <human451[m]> Will Google pixel C ( the tablet) ever be support?
13:56:30 <strcat[m]> no
13:56:42 <strcat[m]> it's EOL and didn't meet our security requirements
13:56:48 <strcat[m]> even before it was EOL I mean
13:58:07 <strcat[m]> it was not a typical Android Pixel device and had a ChromeOS-style bootloader without support for hardware security features with an alternate OS
13:58:49 <strcat[m]> there are probably non-Pixel tablets that are more viable targets than that
14:00:44 <human451[m]> I see. I guess I'll have to stick with a degoogled lineage tablet for the moment
14:01:04 <strcat[m]> use an iPad
14:01:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> [human451](https://matrix.to/#/@human451:matrix.org): pixel C doesn't even meet the glassrom requirements
14:01:27 <strcat[m]> it stopped being sold in 2017 and was last updated in June 2019
14:02:05 <cwecw2d323de32d3> strcat[m] i'm just trying to run an insecure test build on my new 3a device

14:03:00 <cwecw2d323de32d3> is m oattools-package useful here?
14:03:04 <strcat[m]> so you can't have verified boot and full keystore functionality
14:03:26 <strcat[m]> other than that it's just really old, end-of-life (not updated anymore), doesn't support modern AOSP (wasn't a Treble device)
14:03:42 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: only if you want to do a signed build
14:03:59 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: otherwise you can just flash the images by hand already assuming you built properly
14:04:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): actually why not just force otatools to be built?
14:04:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> That works too
14:04:19 <cwecw2d323de32d3> it said build completed
14:04:20 <strcat[m]> because I don't want to force it to be built in dev builds
14:04:22 <strcat[m]> waste of time
14:04:29 <cwecw2d323de32d3> but then i did m oattools-package and stopped it after a couple minutes
14:04:31 <cwecw2d323de32d3> that was bad
14:04:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah
14:04:39 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: make sure to use the same shell
14:04:45 <strcat[m]> with the environment set up
14:04:47 <cwecw2d323de32d3> i am in the same shell
14:04:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> [cwecw2d323de32d3](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_cwecw2d323de32d3:matrix.org): make installclean and run it again then
14:04:54 <strcat[m]> you can't switch to another unless you set it up there too
14:05:00 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: it should run just fine
14:05:14 <cwecw2d323de32d3> okay, but did the m oattools package overwrite the old build now?
14:05:20 <strcat[m]> no
14:05:23 <cwecw2d323de32d3> ok cool
14:05:34 <cwecw2d323de32d3> so can i just take the img file now ?
14:05:37 <cwecw2d323de32d3> system.img ?
14:05:41 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: no
14:05:45 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote above please
14:05:50 <cwecw2d323de32d3> flashing

14:06:10 <strcat[m]> if you aren't going to read what I wrote you aren't going to get a good result
14:06:17 <cwecw2d323de32d3> ok i go back
14:06:30 <strcat[m]> there are multiple firmware images you need to flash and multiple OS images
14:07:00 <strcat[m]> cwecw2d323de32d3: if you aren't able to do that by hand then continue following the instructions
14:07:05 <strcat[m]> make a signed build and flash that with the script
14:07:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> [cwecw2d323de32d3](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_cwecw2d323de32d3:matrix.org): for i in $(ls *img | sed 's/.img//g'); do fastboot flash "$i" "$i".img; done
14:07:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Worked for me lol
14:07:26 <strcat[m]> you also need to format userdata
14:07:28 <cwecw2d323de32d3> ok better stick with the signed build now
14:07:42 <cwecw2d323de32d3> which means i need to build again?
14:07:47 <strcat[m]> no
14:07:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> [cwecw2d323de32d3](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_cwecw2d323de32d3:matrix.org): no

14:09:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> But incremental build of that is around 10 minutes
14:09:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <NorbertTretkowsk "human451: offtopic, but I use th"> Go to offtopic chat then
14:10:52 <strcat[m]> Norbert Tretkowski: no, it doesn't have the security patch from August
14:10:53 <strcat[m]> that's a false claim
14:11:39 <strcat[m]> Norbert Tretkowski: LineageOS uses a fake security patch level across most devices
14:11:46 <strcat[m]> it's not accurate
14:11:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well
14:12:00 <strcat[m]> the last available security patch level for the Pixel C is June 2019
14:12:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Lineage trues to backport the security patch for up to 5 or so past versions
14:12:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> But your kernel and vendor are unpatched
14:12:32 <strcat[m]> doesn't matter
14:12:34 <strcat[m]> exactly
14:12:46 <strcat[m]> and so are components in system not developed as part of AOSP
14:12:55 <strcat[m]> they dropped Pixel C support
14:13:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Lineage tries to backport the security patch for up to 5 or so past versions
14:13:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> I hate legacy tbh
14:13:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> There was this device soc
14:14:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> Msm8994
14:14:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> CAF only did 2 versions and then dropped it
14:14:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Had to merge LTS and track several repos for security patches
14:14:16 <strcat[m]> the reality is that the device never supported secure installations of alternate OSes and has been end-of-life without full security updates being available anywhere for over a year
14:14:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> I somehow managed to do so for 3 years
14:14:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then I was like fuck it
14:14:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> And left
14:15:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Because backporting the security patches to an EOL kernel itself took away 80% of my time
14:15:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not worth it
14:21:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW I also updated the vendor
14:21:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Took as many blobs from other devices as I could.
16:38:39 <vartaa[m]> Hi, i have a question. If i enable dark mode for web contents on Vanadium,    i'll make my fingerprint unique?
16:44:29 <deepthought[m]> Hi all, how is the storage encryption done, is it FDE or FBE? Does an option exist to do FDE?
16:44:47 <Lia[m]> FBE
16:44:51 <sentientted[m]> Hey, sorry if this has already been asked a lot, but I was on the beta channel and didn't realize. My phone updated to android 11 and now I cannot use mobile data and I was just wondering if this was a common problem. Thanks for any help
16:46:56 <deepthought[m]> thx Lia, any chance to start off with Graphene OS based on Android 9 and keep FDE?
16:47:18 <Lia[m]> No.
16:47:37 <Lia[m]> Profile-based encryption uses FBE
16:48:00 <deepthought[m]> ok, thx
16:49:23 <Autopsy[m]> <sentientted[m] "Hey, sorry if this has already b"> You checked the APN settings for your carrier?
16:53:53 <sentientted[m]> Autopsy: I tried finding the apn in the settings and cannot find it, would you be able to tell me where it is?
16:54:48 <strcat[m]> deepthought: I'm not sure why you wouldn't want per-profile encryption where the data can become at rest when a profile is logged out, rather than the key being stuck in memory after early boot until the device is off
16:55:16 <strcat[m]> deepthought: in fact, considering that your phone is probably on nearly all the time, I'm not sure what you really get from FDE vs. a sophisticated adversary unless you have time to turn off the phone
16:55:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Iirc wrappedkey is a thing
16:55:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> That makes FBE outperform
16:56:31 <deepthought[m]> I would accept FBE on top of FDE as and additional security measure
16:56:35 <Autopsy[m]> <sentientted[m] "Autopsy: I tried finding the apn"> Usually network > mobile network,
16:56:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might be a thing with pixel 5
16:57:03 <strcat[m]> deepthought: layering encryption on more encryption doesn't make it more secure
16:57:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> [deepthought](https://matrix.to/#/@deepthought:matrix.org): you do realize you're technically fde right?
16:57:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Metadata encryption basically gets you close to FDE anyway
16:58:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Double encryption usually doesn't work well
16:58:41 <strcat[m]> it's not about it not working well but that it's security theater
16:58:49 <strcat[m]> all data and file names are encrypted
16:59:11 <sentientted[m]> Autopsy: Yeah that is the problem that I found out, it is not there on android 11 and I cannot find anything showing where it is. Do you have any other idea where i could find it, do you think it could be in developer options?
16:59:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> [sentientted](https://matrix.to/#/@sentientted:matrix.org): it's a bug
16:59:41 <deepthought[m]> Does anybody know if this still up-to-date?
16:59:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'm working on fixing it
16:59:43 <deepthought[m]> https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/11/24/android-n-encryption/
16:59:51 <strcat[m]> deepthought: no
16:59:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> [sentientted](https://matrix.to/#/@sentientted:matrix.org): please pm me asap
17:00:05 <strcat[m]> deepthought: and it's somewhat misinformed in the first place
17:00:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> I am unable to test the fix myself
17:00:18 <strcat[m]> not written by someone that knows what they're talking about or tried to educate themselves on the topic first
17:00:33 <strcat[m]> but rather they have preconceived opinions and regular take the opportunity to push those
17:01:01 <strcat[m]> I'm not sure why you care what's written by a consistently dishonest and manipulative person who pushes misinformation after it is corrected
17:02:14 <strcat[m]> all you have to do is look at their twitter feed and how they regularly do that over and over again
17:02:46 <strcat[m]> goal is clearly not makings things better or educating others
17:03:07 <strcat[m]> they mostly do it about things like bitcoin
17:03:07 <deepthought[m]> strcat: Thx, I am just used to FDE and I personally consider FBE less secure
17:03:50 <strcat[m]> deepthought: okay, I'm not sure how a key for the entire data partition in memory from early boot until power off (how often is your phone powered off?) is more secure
17:03:52 <strcat[m]> but you do you
17:04:12 <strcat[m]> what value does FDE have on a device that's always powered on?
17:04:22 <sentientted[m]> anupritaisno1: just so you know I already pmed you, but there is no rush
17:04:37 <strcat[m]> to properly benefit from encryption you need fine-grained encryption where you can keep data at rest
17:04:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> FYI BDE (the FDE you're talking about) actually leaks metadata anyway
17:04:52 <strcat[m]> I doubt you turn off your phone even when you're asleep
17:04:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Android already mounts filesystem's with allow discards
17:05:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> See system/vold
17:05:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> So BDE really
17:05:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> It's debatable if it does not leak metadata
17:05:24 <strcat[m]> if you want to properly benefit from encryption you need to use profiles
17:05:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> It might be leaking more
17:05:36 <strcat[m]> and if there was only FDE you could not take good advantage of it in practice
17:05:46 <strcat[m]> because how often do you actually have your phone powered down
17:05:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Never?
17:06:03 <strcat[m]> and if your concern is a sophisticated adversary, and the phone is powered on / decrypted, it's not really defending against them
17:06:20 <strcat[m]> the key is right there in memory
17:06:26 <strcat[m]> until it's powered off again
17:06:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): BTW what about wrappedkey?
17:06:37 <strcat[m]> at least with per-profile encryption you can keep sensitive data in a profile you rarely use
17:06:45 <deepthought[m]> BDE?
17:06:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> There is a key in ram but it is invalid after a reboot
17:07:01 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: none of that seems very relevant to this
17:07:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> The real key is in keymaster
17:07:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: the TEE keymaster
17:07:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah
17:07:47 <strcat[m]> and the TEE memory is the same physical memory as the SoC just partitioned with IOMMU protection
17:07:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google might tie it with the titan M
17:08:00 <strcat[m]> TEE is not a secure element
17:08:08 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: but they don't use it AFAIK
17:08:26 <strcat[m]> Titan M doesn't have an API for that stuff just the regular keystore API
17:08:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
17:08:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Already tried on pixel 4
17:08:40 <strcat[m]> I'm sure it can work but it uses TEE
17:08:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> The kernel driver is there but it refuses to set up wrapped keys correctly
17:09:01 <strcat[m]> I don't really see how that helps anything
17:09:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> <deepthought[m] "BDE?"> Block device encryption
17:09:32 <strcat[m]> the only benefit of keeping the encryption key away from the OS is if an attacker compromises the OS they get all your data but maybe they don't get the persistent encryption key
17:09:46 <strcat[m]> so if they're kicked out of controlling the device
17:09:51 <strcat[m]> but without wiping
17:09:58 <strcat[m]> and then somehow get physical access later on
17:10:01 <strcat[m]> they can't decrypt it
17:10:09 <strcat[m]> seems like a super contrived, basically useless threat model to me
17:10:13 <deepthought[m]> anupritaisno1: Thx, that's what I meant by saying FDE
17:10:21 <strcat[m]> so yeah it's an improvement
17:10:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're not technically encrypting your entire disk
17:10:24 <strcat[m]> but I don't think wrappedkey or similar features have much real world benefit
17:10:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're encrypting a part of it
17:10:52 <strcat[m]> deepthought: with FBE, all data and file names are encryption, data is encrypted on a per-block basis like FDE
17:10:55 <deepthought[m]> anupritaisno1: Yes, I know, some parts must be kept unencrypted
17:11:00 <strcat[m]> i.e. generally 4k blocks
17:11:13 <strcat[m]> file names are encrypted in 32 byte blocks on GrapheneOS (16 byte on the stock OS)
17:11:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also FDE actually works a lot better
17:11:49 <anupritaisno1[m]> * Also FBE actually works a lot better
17:11:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might not be noticeable on pixel
17:12:14 <strcat[m]>  * deepthought: with FBE, all data and file names are encrypted, data is encrypted on a per-block basis like FDE
17:12:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> CAF had broken discard support for hardware accelerated BDE for several years
17:12:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Google never used it
17:12:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> But this meant most old phones used to slow down
17:12:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> A lot
17:12:52 <strcat[m]> deepthought: either way all data is encrypted, FBE is just finer-grained since there can be per-directory / per-file keys, that's the difference
17:13:42 <deepthought[m]> Is discard really important considering the lifespan of a phone today?
17:13:49 <strcat[m]> deepthought: file names are padded out to 32 byte blocks so the length of a file name isn't known (just multiple of 32 byte, nearly all files are <= 32 byte names though, and I'm unaware of data being stored in file names)
17:14:02 <strcat[m]> deepthought: yes, it's important, and I don't know what you mean by the lifespan of a phone
17:14:13 <strcat[m]> and I'm not sure why that matters anyway
17:14:14 <anupritaisno1[m]> <deepthought[m] "Is discard really important cons"> Trim is important
17:14:26 <strcat[m]> I prefer to be concerned about real things based on threat models
17:14:34 <strcat[m]> not imaginary stuff and baseless FUD
17:14:51 <deepthought[m]> I never use trim/discard on encrypted PC partitions
17:15:11 <strcat[m]> deepthought: and why is that? can you justify it?

This thread from this morning is particularly concerning- commenting on a Nation article about DHS surveillance https://nitter.net/matthew_d_green/status/1308406474864033800#m
17:15:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> The performance hit is huge
17:16:26 <strcat[m]> kryptonymous: really not sure on the relevance
17:17:30 <strcat[m]> US politics is a bad fit for this channel
17:17:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "deepthought: and why is that? ca"> Basically users trim a lot and then ask why their performance sucks
17:17:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Continued in OT
17:18:12 <strcat[m]> don't most devices just have a configuration that uses fstrim
17:18:39 <deepthought[m]> anupritaisno1:
17:18:39 <deepthought[m]> information content of the TRIM information will be small.
17:18:54 <strcat[m]> TRIM simply discards unused blocks
17:18:58 <deepthought[m]> anupritaisno1: https://www.saout.de/pipermail/dm-crypt/2012-April/002420.html
17:19:31 <deepthought[m]> strcat: Yes, I know what it does, never enabled it on my PCs
17:20:22 <strcat[m]> the only information is which blocks are used / not used
17:20:30 <strcat[m]> nothing beyond that
17:21:13 <strcat[m]> with FDE chances are the attacker gets your device with the data decrypted anyway
17:21:50 <strcat[m]> with FBE you can partition it between profiles and at least avoid them getting the device with more than the active profile decrypted
17:21:57 <deepthought[m]> I would not enable it on a phone either as lifespan of a phone is 2-3 years because after that time, there are not security updates anmyore. I am not a phone power user, so why would trim be a huge advantage for me
17:22:43 <strcat[m]> we want to provide more control over user profiles so there is direct control over keeping a profile active in the background (for example, to receive alerts of notifications) or logging it out immediately so that the data is at rest again
17:22:58 <strcat[m]> it's one of the things being worked on
17:23:02 <strcat[m]> various aspects of improving profiles
17:23:25 <strcat[m]> since it's one of the most important encryption features along with being very useful for isolating workspaces with different shared data
17:23:56 <strcat[m]> encryption is no good if you just keep data decrypted all the time
17:24:07 <deepthought[m]> strcat: I do not really need the partitioning of FBE as I do not store secret stuff on my phone, but I agree that it is useful for others
17:24:07 <strcat[m]> that's like how many companies claim data on their servers is encrypted because they use FDE
17:24:17 <strcat[m]> but the servers are just always on and decrypted
17:24:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "that's like how many companies c"> Useless
17:24:35 <strcat[m]> deepthought: I think you're misunderstanding why it's useful and how profiles can be used then
17:24:40 <deepthought[m]> strcat: Yes, that's right.
17:24:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> If police, etc want to raid they can do freezing attacks and so on
17:25:28 <deepthought[m]> strcat: That may be the case
17:25:32 <strcat[m]> deepthought: also just because the granularity is currently limited to profiles doesn't mean it can't be more granular
17:25:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): BTW encryption does help
17:26:05 <strcat[m]> it only helps if it's at rest or it's an unsophisticated adversary
17:26:10 <kryptonymous[m]> <strcat[m] "kryptonymous: really not sure on"> Agree politics are a low-level waste of time. But the article Matthew Green cited (https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/homeland-security-portland/) was not focused on politics, but on phone cloning and surveillance.

17:26:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example the homeserver I'm chatting from has SED + dm-crypt

17:29:13 <strcat[m]> and continue pushing it
17:29:25 <strcat[m]> that doesn't mean their feed consists solely of misinformation
17:29:26 <strcat[m]> it means you can't trust what they say
17:29:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> [riapreg](https://matrix.to/#/@riapreg:matrix.org): select recovery mode
17:29:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Once booted to a dead android logo press power and then press volume up
17:29:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Use the volume up/down keys to go to factory data reset and use power to confirm
17:30:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah BTW
17:30:21 <strcat[m]> they are smart and know better, but choose to feign ignorance and push misinformation when it suits them
17:30:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Think I forgot my pixel 4 password too
17:30:34 <kryptonymous[m]> You'd mentioned Bitcoin above- is that in particular a topic on which he disinforms?
17:30:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Shit
17:30:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Anyway there was nothing important on it
17:30:59 <strcat[m]> kryptonymous: encryption, secure messaging, cryptocurrencies, mobile phone security, mobile OS security, various privacy topics, web browsers
17:31:03 <deepthought[m]> strcat:  anupritaisno1  Thx for the information and answers
17:31:03 <strcat[m]> they like to push a lot of misinformation
17:31:15 <strcat[m]> sometimes they change their mind and push misinformation in the other direction
17:31:50 <strcat[m]> they are almost as likely to spread FUD about iOS as Android even though they are a pretty fervent iOS fanboy
17:32:10 <strcat[m]> can't trust what they say, it's that simple
17:32:15 <Autopsy[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Think I forgot my pixel 4 passwo"> 42069
17:32:18 <strcat[m]> inherently dishonest person
17:32:46 <strcat[m]> so for example they always promote Signal but then every now and then they'll push some FUD about it when they dislike something
17:32:52 <strcat[m]> they don't stick to factual criticism
17:33:04 <deepthought[m]> BTW, in Linux it is possible to do FDE and e.g. Encfs, or additionally encrypt files with pgp
17:33:12 <strcat[m]> same for stuff like Telegram and lots of other things
17:33:21 <strcat[m]> there is legitimate criticism mixed in with a whole lot of FUD
17:33:23 <strcat[m]> and they know it's not true
17:33:27 <strcat[m]> they just don't care
17:33:32 <riapreg[m]> anupritaisno1: yes. correct. thanks a lot! you saved me ð
17:33:48 <deepthought[m]> I found some more references regarding issues with FBE
17:34:02 <strcat[m]> deepthought: and what about the issues with FDE?
17:34:18 <kryptonymous[m]> Interesting. OK thanks.
17:34:30 <deepthought[m]> comparted to FDE it was not just the link I sent
17:35:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> [deepthought](https://matrix.to/#/@deepthought:matrix.org): how many times does it need to be said?
17:36:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> FBE + metadata encryption is equivalent to BDE
17:36:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or better in some cases
17:36:23 <strcat[m]> it's not equivalent
17:37:42 <strcat[m]> anyway it's not interesting to discuss a technical topic based on conjecture and claims not based on how it actually works
17:38:31 <strcat[m]> if you wanted to use FBE with a global boot passphrase and use it the only way you can use FDE, nothing stops you from using it that way
17:38:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Metadata encryption does encrypt sector 0 though
17:39:42 <strcat[m]> I don't find metadata encryption to be much an improvement but sure it has that now
17:39:49 <strcat[m]> file names were already padded + encrypted
17:41:21 <strcat[m]>  * if you wanted to use FBE with a global boot passphrase to use it the only way you can use FDE, nothing stops you from using it that way
17:43:11 <strcat[m]> there is no data that's not encrypted - the difference is not that
17:43:42 <strcat[m]> the difference is that FBE is granular so it's more flexible in how it's used and can be used in a way that provides finer-grained encryption keys
17:43:49 <strcat[m]> either way all data is encrypted
17:46:04 <deepthought[m]> The difference it, the device did not boot the full OS yet with FDE
17:46:06 <strcat[m]> FBE is what enables per-profile encryption keys and the ability to explicitly store data that's device encrypted which is what makes it so that accessibility services don't need to disable credential-based encryption like before (since it's per-profile)
17:46:20 <strcat[m]> and for example our Updater app explicitly opts into direct boot and stores the downloaded updates with device encryption
17:46:27 <strcat[m]> deepthought: the device booted the OS either way
17:46:59 <strcat[m]> deepthought: and while FBE enables finer-grained encryption keys it doesn't force that to be done
17:47:30 <strcat[m]> deepthought: I don't think designing around a global boot passphrase makes much sense especially when the real value is in data that's kept at rest while locked
17:47:40 <strcat[m]> but FBE certainly does not prevent using that approach
17:47:52 <strcat[m]> either way, FDE or FBE, all data stored is encrypted
17:48:05 <strcat[m]> if you wanted you could use a single global encryption key with FBE
17:48:16 <strcat[m]> it's not a property of whether you use block layer or filesystem layer encryption
17:48:34 <strcat[m]> the filesystem layer encryption as used in the default AOSP encryption has per-profile encryption keys, that's a higher level design choice
17:48:43 <strcat[m]> it wasn't possible with FDE, but FBE obviously doesn't force doing it that way
17:49:27 <strcat[m]> previously if you enabled an accessibility service
17:49:30 <strcat[m]> with FDE
17:49:36 <strcat[m]> credential-based encryption was simply disabled
17:50:12 <strcat[m]> because how else could it work? it didn't have the flexibility to be able to configure anything (including security restrictions) before entering the passphrase
17:50:18 <strcat[m]> so also
17:52:02 <strcat[m]> the setting for a limit on the # of attempts to decrypt couldn't really work with FDE at least without a hardware implementation
17:52:50 <strcat[m]> and you didn't have a way to get an over-the-air security update without decrypting all data so you couldn't apply a security fix in a situation where you didn't want to decrypt your data
17:52:52 <strcat[m]> among other examples
17:53:12 <strcat[m]> and of course having per-profile encryption keys is a pretty big deal especially considering how focused we're going to be on profiles
17:53:48 <deepthought[m]> strcat: anupritaisno1 Thank you.
17:54:03 <strcat[m]> profiles are the way that the OS provides having separate identities / workspaces
17:54:11 <strcat[m]> apps can't share data or communicate across them
17:54:17 <strcat[m]> and that's the only way you can have multiple instances of an app
17:54:52 <strcat[m]> previously with a boot passphrase, the owner of the device would have to enter that on boot and then everything is decrypted until it's powered off
17:56:12 <strcat[m]> vs. the approach of per-profile encryption keys based on the per-profile lock method
17:56:35 <strcat[m]> with support for convenience via secondary unlock mechanisms (currently biometrics, but if you look in the tracker, we have plans for 2-factor secondary unlock)
17:57:07 <strcat[m]> so you can set a passphrase for each profile, the passphrase is required for the initial unlock (on boot, or if it was logged out after usage)
17:57:20 <strcat[m]> secondary unlock mechanisms are only used for lockscreen security + protecting keystore
17:57:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> How do you recover from 2fa?
17:57:25 <strcat[m]> they don't weaken encryption
17:57:30 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: what do you mean
17:57:34 <strcat[m]> it's a secondary unlock mechanism
17:57:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Let's say your fingerprint hardware broke
17:57:39 <strcat[m]> it doesn't matter if it stops working or you forget it
17:57:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> What now?
17:58:03 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: so you're inconvenienced by having to log in with your passphrase every time instead of only for the initial unlock
17:58:32 <strcat[m]> don't really see how 2FA secondary unlock changes that
17:58:45 <strcat[m]>  * don't really see how 2 factor secondary unlock changes that
17:59:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): wait so is 2fa like a simpler passphrase + biometric and you keep a complex passphrase for encryption?
17:59:09 <strcat[m]> it will work exactly as secondary unlock mechanisms already do
17:59:28 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes it's simply the ability to add a 2nd factor (PIN, passphrase) to secondary unlock
17:59:47 <strcat[m]> it has nothing to do with the primary unlock mechanism used for the profile's encryption key
18:00:03 <strcat[m]> secondary unlock is only usable for a limited time and a limited # of attempts after primary unlock
18:00:10 <strcat[m]> and of course can't be used for the initial unlock
18:00:15 <strcat[m]> that's how it already works, this is how it is now
18:00:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> So what's the threat model?
18:00:34 <strcat[m]> the feature we plan to add is just the ability to add a PIN + passphrase to secondary unlock
18:00:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Somebody can't unlock when you're asleep?
18:01:27 <strcat[m]> we want people to be able to use a strong passphrase for their primary unlock mechanism
18:01:30 <strcat[m]> while having convenience
18:01:37 <strcat[m]> which is why the existing secondary unlock feature is useful
18:01:58 <strcat[m]> but right now secondary unlock only offers biometric options (IR-based face scanning or IR-based fingerprint scanning)
18:02:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also I hear biometric manager now uses the same methods for face and fingerprint so what stops this feature from being implemented?
18:02:23 <strcat[m]> so we want to add the ability to add a PIN + passphrase for secondary unlock
18:02:42 <strcat[m]> so then it's knowledge + biometric instead of just a physical thing
18:03:14 <strcat[m]> it's a straightforward feature
18:03:21 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: nothing stops it from being implemented
18:03:34 <strcat[m]> there are a lot of planned features on the tracker, this is one of them
18:03:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Does seem there's challenges
18:04:00 <strcat[m]> making the UI
18:04:08 <strcat[m]> is the main challenge
18:04:17 <strcat[m]> not really much of a challenge
18:04:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Care will need to be taken to make sure we store the passphrase somewhere secure
18:04:33 <strcat[m]> you don't store passphrases
18:04:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like we can't put the passphrase in the DE by accident
18:04:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "you don't store passphrases"> Yes hashed
18:05:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> Can we reuse the per user code for pin scrambling?
18:05:47 <strcat[m]> I don't remember how we implemented the setting for that
18:06:28 <strcat[m]> I don't think it can be done the same way
18:06:54 <strcat[m]> the main 'challenge' is figuring out the existing UI flow, where to put this, and implementing the UI securely
18:07:12 <strcat[m]> since it's largely a UI security feature (it only works when the profile is already logged in with the main unlock method)
18:07:26 <strcat[m]> maybe we could wire it up to further secure the keystore locking security
18:07:30 <strcat[m]> but that might not be realistic
18:07:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically don't create a system ui bypass vuln?
18:07:45 <strcat[m]> keystore protects keys that are tied to lock state when locked
18:07:53 <strcat[m]> and of course that's based on lock methods
18:08:03 <strcat[m]> ideally it would use fingerprint + PIN for that not just fingerprint
18:08:15 <strcat[m]> but it may not be realistic to do that
18:08:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): also
18:09:37 <strcat[m]> the main unlock method isn't something we want to change other than perhaps removing the bad choices (pattern, PIN) and limiting PIN to secondary unlock
18:09:52 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: IMG_20200922_233940_555.jpg < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/UWepTbliJktxjKQyghqzmBlN/IMG_20200922_233940_555.jpg >
18:09:54 <strcat[m]> but I don't think it makes sense to remove those choices from secondary profiles
18:10:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Should the password be asked here?
18:10:16 <strcat[m]> no
18:10:28 <strcat[m]> it's solely about secondary unlock
18:10:38 <deepthought[m]> FYI, the link does not work for me https://jollyrogers.ca/public/grapheneos-channel-rules.txt
18:10:38 <deepthought[m]> Unable to connect
18:10:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): so secondary password only on lock screen?
18:10:49 <strcat[m]> yes
18:10:51 <strcat[m]> keep it simple
18:10:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Not if a biometric app wants it?
18:11:05 <strcat[m]> it's unrelated to that
18:11:22 <strcat[m]> biometrics can be set to only be usable in apps rather than secondary unlock
18:11:22 <strcat[m]> they're separate uses
18:11:42 <strcat[m]> (it's just only in the Settings app for face unlock atm)
18:11:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): then should this password be backed on titan m or no?
18:11:45 <strcat[m]> look at the face unlock settings on the Pixel 4
18:12:05 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "look at the face unlock settings"> Oh BTW they need fixing
18:12:08 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no - there's no reason to store it anywhere but the profile's credential encrypted data
18:12:21 <strcat[m]> what about it needs fixing?
18:12:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> Unless you are on the dark theme some UI elements are not visible
18:12:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> Happens on the official GSI too
18:13:24 <strcat[m]> atm the priorities are SetupWizard and the APN stuff
18:13:27 <strcat[m]> really need that done this week
18:14:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> APN probably today
18:14:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> Waiting for this build to finish
18:15:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Also not sure if we can fix that face unlock issue [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_strcat:matrix.org)
18:16:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Might need to decompile the face unlock app and fix the resources
18:16:36 <strcat[m]> no
18:16:51 <strcat[m]> I don't really see why it would be a problem
18:17:21 <strcat[m]> copying their xml configuration is an easy option but we could also just figure it out ourselves
18:17:35 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well it isn't
18:17:39 <strcat[m]> and I don't know why you say there might be a possibility we can't fix it
18:17:46 <strcat[m]> doesn't make any sense
18:17:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just a few instructions on the setup screen aren't readable
18:18:03 <strcat[m]> ok and it's just some ui code
18:18:05 <strcat[m]> why wouldn't we be able to fix it
18:18:16 <strcat[m]> even if we didn't have something to use as a reference we could fix it
18:18:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> Dunno
18:18:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> We can?
18:18:52 <strcat[m]> there are other minor issues with dark vs. light theme in some of the UI
18:18:56 <strcat[m]> no reason it can't be fixed
18:19:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> How would you
18:19:31 <strcat[m]> we just don't have the Settings app fully configured properly
18:19:39 <strcat[m]> don't know what you mean
18:19:47 <strcat[m]> but you not knowing how to do something doesn't mean it can't be done
18:20:06 <strcat[m]> a minor UI issue is entirely fixable
18:20:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "we just don't have the Settings "> So more overlays?
18:20:15 <strcat[m]> if that's the problem
18:20:33 <strcat[m]> usually the problem is we're missing resource configuration
18:20:44 <strcat[m]> no point of doing it with overlays if we want the same configuration across all devices
18:20:51 <strcat[m]> we can just change the default Settings resources
18:21:06 <strcat[m]> look at the existing examples in the Settings repo
18:21:37 <strcat[m]> the Settings app has resources you can use to configure various aspects of the appearance, which settings are enabled and to add things like demonstration graphics
18:21:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Doing it
18:21:45 <strcat[m]> even if it didn't we can just change the code
18:22:08 <strcat[m]> but any differences are going to be from resources
18:23:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): actually I think I got it
18:23:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> So the problem is white text on white, maybe some resource is hardcoded somewhere?
18:24:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> I was able to figure that out in the past working on oms
19:36:49 <bypassbobby[m]> Anyone have any opinions on the safety of using KeepassDX on graphene
19:41:38 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: It's an open-source app, and you can deny it network access
19:44:04 <bypassbobby[m]> I mean if authorities got the phone how secure is it
19:44:58 <uchihaitachi[m]>  may be it depends on your master password
19:45:09 <alzxjm[m]> bypassbobby: Do you mean if the authorities get the phone while it's unlocked?
19:45:19 <dazinism> Lynn had a quick look at it and said it appeared respectable. They are a cryptographer who had a closer look at Aegis Authenticator  https://github.com/lynn-stephenson/analysis/blob/master/Aegis%20Authenticator%20v1.1.4.md
19:45:36 <alzxjm[m]> If the phone is locked they'll have to unlock it first to even try at your encrypted password databse.
19:46:25 <dazinism> They said use Aegis over andOTP
19:46:28 <bypassbobby[m]> Yes if they somehow unlocked the phone and keepass was the only thing between them and all my password
19:46:35 <bypassbobby[m]> * Yes if they somehow unlocked the phone and keepass was the only thing between them and all my passwords
19:48:09 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: I suggest watching https://vimeo.com/95066828 from 16:33 onwards for a threat model vs a government
19:48:27 <dazinism> bypassbobby: should be reasonably safe. Guess if you had biometric database unlocking enabled and they were able to fake your biometrics you passwords are theirs
19:49:20 <dazinism> Otherwise would depend on the strength of your passphrase.
19:50:42 <bypassbobby[m]> Is it possible to open veracrypt files on graphene
19:51:04 <bypassbobby[m]> <jpds "bypassbobby: I suggest watching "> Thanks I'll check that out
19:51:19 <jpds> 16:13* actually
19:52:47 <bypassbobby[m]> I'm thinking an encrypted USB would be better to load the encrypted container with my passwords on
