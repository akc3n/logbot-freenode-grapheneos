00:02:08 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Nah, I open the gallery app (little picture icon?) and long press an image
00:02:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> the dot-line-dot-line-dot icon shows up next to my most common used sharing-app
00:02:44 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Up in the same bar as "1 Selected"
00:02:55 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Could you share what yours looks like/describe it, defconanon12 ?

00:11:25 <DannyWorkOrderPr> uh...sir? it looks like you don't have any images lmao
00:11:53 <DannyWorkOrderPr> How are you long-pressing one?
00:22:35 <defconanon12[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: I can't see any images.
00:22:47 <defconanon12[m]> I also did what you said selecting album does nothing.
00:23:34 <defconanon12[m]> Also, I want you to keep guessing. Heh
00:25:37 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <defconanon12[m] "Danny@WorkOrderPro: I can't see "> As in, you have them, but they're not showing here?
00:26:01 <defconanon12[m]> Correct.
00:26:42 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Ah. Well, that sounds like a permissions issue.
00:26:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Double check the Gallery app's permissions?
00:28:54 <defconanon12[m]> Danny@WorkOrderPro: Oh silly me! I didn't have the storage set on. Imagine that!
00:28:57 <defconanon12[m]> xD
00:29:21 <defconanon12[m]> And I thought it was just because I was in beta.
00:32:24 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <defconanon12[m] "And I thought it was just becaus"> We all are always in beta. </philosophy>
00:37:45 <TheJollyRoger> Anyone who's PM'd me in the past ~3 hours, could you resend your messages, please? My client decided to conk out again and I forget who messaged me with which and wasn't able to check.

02:01:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> kb8doa: What's happening?
02:03:38 <anne232> sorry if this question has been asked before, but will the pixel 4 be supported soon? i really want to start using graphene, but if the pixel 4 will be supported in the near future, it may be worth it for me to wait so it will have longer support?
02:10:52 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Coincidentally, I had this exact same error.
02:11:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> It sorted itself out. I have no fucking idea how.
02:11:11 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Would not receive MMS, LTE wouldn't activate....
02:11:41 <DannyWorkOrderPr> Just kept fiddling with the APN menu, toggling shit on and off, and eventually started cooperating.

04:53:19 <sheruleeya[m]> * anne232 :   grapheneos.org/releases
05:36:25 <oek[m]> I am attempting to install GrapheneOS on my Pixel 3 on Ubuntu on a VirtualBox. It appears that I unlocked the bootloader as the screen is says, `Fastboot Mode - Device state: unlocked` - However the next step of the guide on grapheneos.org: https://grapheneos.org/install#flashing-factory-images I am unsuccessful with. I believe it may be a connection issue from my computer to my phone. Does anyone know what I need to do to
05:36:25 <oek[m]> flash the factory image?
05:37:23 <anne232> @sheruleeya[m], what does it mean that it's 'experimental'?
05:37:27 <anne232> Like are there a lot of bugs in it or something?
05:40:15 <oek[m]> ADB output is:
05:40:15 <oek[m]> `* daemon started successfully
05:40:15 <oek[m]> List of devices attached`
05:42:06 <oek[m]> This makes me believe that there is an issue with the device being recognized.
05:43:40 <ruddo[m]> Yes.
05:43:59 <ruddo[m]> Your device doesn't have ADB debugging enabled.
05:44:22 <ruddo[m]> Please follow instructions on the install page to a T.  Thanks.
05:45:18 <TheJollyRoger> Hi oek[m], I would advise you do not attempt to install from any operating system in VirtualBox.
05:46:41 <oek[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hi oek, I would advise you do no"> Ok, in this case I can not install this custom rom as I do not have Catalina installed
05:46:43 <TheJollyRoger> USB passthrough can be very chancy depending on the host, guest, hardware, and virtualization software.
05:47:01 <oek[m]> Unless there is a guide for a system that is not running Catalina
05:49:05 <oek[m]> TheJollyRoger: So the issue is not related to adb debugging mode? I searched the guide for `adb debugging` and I have followed the guide to a T, yet I have an issue with this.
05:49:21 <TheJollyRoger> Your perogative, but if you run into problems, USB passthrough on Virtualbox is extremely buggy.
05:49:24 <JTL> If you can run a recent verison of fastboot it *should* work regardless
05:49:31 <oek[m]> Is there an install guide for OS Mojave?
05:49:32 <JTL> of the macOS version
05:49:33 <TheJollyRoger> And we likely won't be able to help.
05:49:43 <TheJollyRoger> oek[m]: please use an officially supported host operating system.
05:50:00 <JTL> but is only tested with supported operating systems
05:50:22 <oek[m]> <JTL "If you can run a recent verison "> Ok I can run the recent `fastboot` version as listed on the guide
05:50:32 <JTL> what macOS version are you running?
05:50:46 <JTL> Please don't be 10,000 years old...
05:50:50 <JTL> </joke>
05:50:55 <oek[m]> 10.14.6
05:51:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <TheJollyRoger "USB passthrough can be very chan"> Actually on both glassrom and grapheneos there's at least one breakage known when using USB passthrough
05:51:25 <JTL> 10.14 isn't horrible, and I'm not aware of any issues preventing fastboot with that OS version
05:51:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> It causes some hypervisors like virtualbox' entire passthrough system sometimes crash
05:51:47 <sheruleeya[m]> <anne232 "Like are there a lot of bugs in "> Not too sure about it, the developers can answer the question better.
05:51:55 <JTL> It might work, but we can not offer any assurances that it's going to work properly
05:52:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> A reboot is needed before virtualbox will allow passing anything at all again
05:52:12 <JTL> anupritaisno1[m]: With USB passthrough being buggy. I agree
05:52:22 <oek[m]> Ok, I will try the guide from the macOS instructions and go from there.
05:52:43 <JTL> While you're not running latest macOS, that's still much better than a buggy virtual machine stack
05:52:43 <oek[m]> If I am unable to get this installed I will return the phone.
05:53:34 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: oh shoot. I just got your message, one sec.
05:53:55 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: yikes. I didn't realize it was that bad.
05:54:09 <oek[m]> Thanks for confirming
06:39:47 <dazinism> Danny@WorkOrderPro defconanon12 think its possible to 'screencast' using the VLC app. Theres also an app on Fdroid that lets it stream YouTube

07:41:22 <joshman[m]> Force quit acting weird. I have installed WhatsApp. All permissions disabled, force quitted the app and yet that nag error message Not Responding App pops up various times a day
07:42:40 <joshman[m]> It became so annoying I uninstalled WhatsApp. Next time I'll need it I'll have re-register it with number again. A bit time consuming option imo
07:43:54 <joshman[m]> Bottom line. With everything disabled, some WA services are still running
07:56:57 <dallemon[m]> <joshman[m] "Bottom line. With everything dis"> I would guess they don't support not having Google Play very well.
08:09:29 <stefanb> WhatsApp working fine here on old CyanogenMod w/o GApps/svcs
08:11:29 <stefanb> That binary is downloaded directly from WhatsApp website btw.
08:19:00 <macg[m]> WhatsApp works great without Google services
08:29:12 <strcat[m]> josh.man: force stop in app settings is not the same as quitting it via the not responding error
10:55:40 <dazinism> josh.man: Force Stop doesnt necessarily work properly for apps in a work profile - if thats where you have WhatsApp
10:57:40 <dazinism> If you are using shelter you can freeze apps to stop them
10:58:38 <dazinism> Can mark an app as Auto Freeze and then put a Batch Freeze icon on your home screen to achieve this quickly
11:24:18 <joshman[m]> "dazinism" (https://matrix.to/#/@DzzzzzzR:matrix.org) I thought shelter is not recommended

11:45:17 <mxnorvak[m]> Sry i don't own a pixel 4 , i was just happy because it was important that someone actually does this
11:46:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah cool
11:46:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll arrange my own testers too to run CTS and stuff
11:55:24 <frenchieisverige> <anupritaisno1[m] "Yeah cool "> I'm confused. Are those separate builds ?
11:56:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes I'll usually have snapshots to test stuff like LTS merges before they land upstream
12:00:44 <frenchieisverige> OK. By upstream you mean in the official releases
12:02:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes
12:02:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'll be testing changes before they're landed upstream

12:39:48 <alzxjm[m]1> <anupritaisno1[m] "It seems I am the pixel 4 mainta"> That's exciting! Does that cover the Pixel 4 XL as well? They seem to be essentially the same device other than screen and battery.
12:39:54 <mxnorvak[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "How does Google even do that "> Does what?
12:40:19 <alzxjm[m]1> I'm going to try and flash my Pixel 4 XL today since I have a Seedvault backup from CalyxOS.
12:40:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Look at that latency
13:49:24 <dazinism> Oh nice one anupritaisno1
13:49:24 <dazinism> 🎉we have a maintainer 🎉
13:51:33 <sivuda1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Look at that latency "> Latency in?
13:53:07 <frenchieisverige> anupritaisno1 I  know I asked this question before, but when can we expect a stable version of gos for the pixel 4?
13:54:52 <dazinism> josh.man: shelter reduces security, but as I understand it, mainly for stuff held in the work profile.
13:55:12 <cdesai> dazinism: how does it reduce security?
13:55:17 <dazinism> Think it still needs someone to exploit the shelter app to gain the privileges it holds
13:55:32 <cdesai> ah, yeah.
13:55:42 <dazinism> Its got device manager permission over the work profile
13:56:42 <dazinism> Important thing is not to grant it device manager over personal profile
13:58:39 <dazinism> So its weighing up the security concerns vs. the benefits to usability (and possibility security and privacy) of having the isolation of the work profile
14:00:19 <dazinism> Ideally work would be done to enable user profiles to have better usability. Then using shelter would be much less interesting
14:00:40 <dazinism> Also scoped storage reduces my interest.
14:01:41 <dazinism> A big part of why I liked it was being able to have apps which would only really work with storage permission running without sucking up all my files
14:04:51 <dazinism> frenchieisverige: I'd guess now that it has an official maintainer, with the necessary skill set and a pretty good track record of getting stuff done.
14:05:31 <dazinism> Also that there already is experimental factory images available for download.
14:05:58 <dazinism> That it probably will not be so very long.
14:06:46 <dazinism> Think theres not really any major issues already?
14:11:20 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dazinism "Danny@WorkOrderPro defconanon12 "> What receives/what type of stream does it generate? Do you need another VLC on other end?
14:11:56 <dazinism> Not sure sorry... no doubt find info with some searches
14:12:32 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <anupritaisno1[m] "It seems I am the pixel 4 mainta"> Why do I see a Google App Protect or whatever icon, haha

14:12:58 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <dazinism "Not sure sorry... no doubt find "> For sure, wanted to share for group posterity
14:13:24 <defconanon12[m]> dazinism: I will give that a try thank you.
14:14:37 <defconanon12[m]> Has anyone's Signal been acting up? Kept stopping and restarting. And even when I shut it off it would start back up again? Is this a new update issue?

14:16:23 <defconanon12[m]> Also, danzinism I don't see the message at all. Don't know if I am dealing with display issues.
14:16:51 <defconanon12[m]> Gotta love VLC.
14:17:06 <frenchieisverige> <dazinism "frenchieisverige: I'd guess now "> OK thanks. I guess my best bet is to wait the stable version of the pixel 4 to get maximum support time
14:19:19 <defconanon12[m]> Nah I found the message all good.
14:21:35 <dazinism> defconanon12: what message don't you see?
14:21:51 <dazinism> Ah lol
14:22:24 <defconanon12[m]> dazinism: The messaged where you pinged me but I found it. Just had to scroll up a bit more than where I was jumping to.
14:22:47 <dazinism> On desktop riot can jump to messages that pinged you via the bell icon top right
14:23:31 <dazinism> Nothing like that on android. Hopefully one day, can be annoying in busy rooms if you away for a few days
14:25:33 <defconanon12[m]> Well jumping messages work. I don't know mind looking. Call me a scanner I guess. Heh.
14:25:46 <dazinism> frenchieisverige: Think you'd get most support moving ASAP. I'd guess that experimental will get an update that makes it stable.
14:27:36 <dazinism> Also I imagine that it will be very usable already. Maybe a small chance of hitting bugs. Also possibly security not equal to stable releases - but probably still pretty good.
14:27:55 <defconanon12[m]> I think I am going to do a factory reset. I am not feeling safe. My battery usage is going more down then usual. Could be a bad battery. Not sure.
14:28:56 <DannyWorkOrderPr> defconanon12: just reboot, and use Auditor.
14:28:58 <dazinism> defconanon12: can see whats using battery in settings
14:30:47 <dazinism> As long as you've not installed any sketchy apps / random apks you are pretty safe.
14:31:06 <dazinism> Sometimes some messengers can really eat battery
14:31:29 <dazinism> Not quite sure why it can be so much worse sometimes
14:31:56 <dazinism> Seen it from Signal, Riot, RiotX and Conversations
14:32:24 <defconanon12[m]> RiotX got down to 1% in 17 minutes.
14:32:33 <dazinism> Conversations is definately much better behaved than the rest
14:33:40 <defconanon12[m]> Keep in mind I have airplane mode on, WiFi only, battery saver, and night light enabled.
14:34:21 <defconanon12[m]> Is it wise to always have battery saver enabled?
14:34:21 <dazinism> Can change settings in RiotX, but then dont get notifications until you open the app
14:34:47 <dazinism> Much less battery drain though
14:36:00 <dazinism> defconanon12:battery saver kills everything quick. Think apps cant do stuff in background.  Generally not a good idea. Unless you want that.
14:36:46 <defconanon12[m]> How quick cause usually I have to kill all the apps either way.
14:37:24 <dazinism> Eg. With battery saver think you probably won't get notifications from messengers unless app is in foreground
14:37:27 <dazinism> I've not tested though
14:39:46 <defconanon12[m]> I am still able to get notifications with battery saver. Well FOSS apps of course.
14:40:24 <fll[m]> People here told they slept in with battery saver cause no alarms
14:40:38 <fll[m]> So careful there ;)
14:40:53 <defconanon12[m]> I don't need an alarm on my phone.
14:40:59 <sheruleeya[m]> <defconanon12[m] "I am still able to get notificat"> Same here
14:42:06 <defconanon12[m]> Internal clockwork. ^^
14:42:15 <dazinism> https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/power
14:43:01 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <fll[m] "People here told they slept in w"> lmfao, that explains so much about a dipshit close to me...good to know
14:49:01 <defconanon12[m]> Maybe it is because I am in beta but even restricting the app to not have in the background is not working.
14:49:37 <defconanon12[m]> Unless there is a timeout when it kills the app in the background.
14:53:01 <alzxjm[m]1> OK, I have GrapheneOS installed on my Pixel 4 XL.
14:54:23 <raheemwala[m]> how is it running?
14:54:33 <raheemwala[m]> stable any crashes please let me know
14:54:41 <raheemwala[m]> i have pixel 2 XL
14:54:51 <raheemwala[m]> and graphene is running pretty stable on that one
14:56:02 <alzxjm[m]1> The biggest issue I have so far is that I can't get Syncthing or Syncthing-Fork to work. The app(s) go through the initial setup and ask for permissions, but they are immediately terminated otherwise.
14:56:05 <alzxjm[m]1> Installed from F-Droid and also from Aurora Store. Same issues.
14:56:40 <alzxjm[m]1> Definitely the biggest issue so far is that USB debugging has ceased working. It was fine for flashing the OS, and it worked in CalyxOS, but I can no longer detect the device. I have checked it in Developer Settings.
14:57:16 <sixBit[m]> <raheemwala[m] "stable any crashes please let me"> I'm running it on the 4 for a week now. Haven't had any issues so far
14:58:54 <alzxjm[m]1> Nevermind on the adb issue. I tried from a different machine and it's working on that one. Weird.
14:59:59 <defconanon12[m]> alzxjm: Check your drivers.
15:01:15 <alzxjm[m]1> Yeah I dunno. It's odd. I've been using my Pixelbook with Crostini to do all this flashing and adb stuff with my P4XL. Worked on stock and CalyxOS. As soon as I flashed GrapheneOS it stopped working.
15:02:07 <defconanon12[m]> Again you need to make sure your drivers are up to date on your desktop if your desktop can't see your device.
15:03:56 <alzxjm[m]1> I will keep troubleshooting this on my own. Certainly will check drivers. Any idea on Syncthing not working
15:08:32 <dazinism> defconanon12: doubt very much its to do with beta
15:08:58 <dazinism> What you mean ' restricting the app to not have in the background'
15:09:20 <dazinism> Stop it running in background?
15:09:45 <dazinism> If so using Force Stop should do that.
15:15:08 <pikey[m]> Has attestation.app stopped working recently! My last verification was days ago for some reason
15:15:32 <dazinism> Hey pikey I got one a couple hours ago
15:15:49 <pikey[m]> <pikey[m] "Has attestation.app stopped work"> Howdy. Thanks. weird
15:16:09 <dazinism> Login and check on the server?
15:16:26 <pikey[m]> I just rescanned the screen but still not showing an updated verification
15:17:17 <dazinism> pikey: you set up a new pairing with the server?
15:18:00 <dazinism> Can you see details of your previous pairing there?
15:18:01 <alzxjm[m]1> Syncthing-fork fails such that at the last step of the setup wizard I get the message "Failed to create configuration. Check logcat output."
15:18:17 <pikey[m]> <pikey[m] "I just rescanned the screen but "> It was working fine. I just turned off remote verification in auditor app and turned on again. But no workie so far
15:18:31 <pikey[m]> > Can you see details of your previous pairing there?
15:18:31 <pikey[m]> Yep
15:19:16 <dazinism> alzxjm: check logcat or use the bug report function in developer options and send it on to anupritaisno1
15:22:46 <dazinism> pikey: not sure exactly what happens when disabling /enabling remote. I'd kind of expect it wouldnt need you to scan anything new..
15:23:02 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "alzxjm: check logcat or use the "> Yeah
15:23:57 <pikey[m]> First time using riot on pixel here. Only ever used desktop. How do you reply to a msg?
15:25:15 <pikey[m]> I have a notification on phone saying 'failed to submit remote attestation'
15:25:24 <dazinism> pikey: also not sure how the server handles things if you have more than one pairing set up with it (if it even is possible? )
15:25:33 <pikey[m]> No idea why tho. I am connected to internet ok
15:25:52 <pikey[m]> I only have one pairing set up
15:26:07 <dazinism> pikey: tap on a message then you are replying to it
15:26:31 <pikey[m]> Oh. Haha. Thanks
15:26:40 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "pikey: tap on a message then you"> Thanks
15:26:40 <dazinism> Tap it again to not be replying
15:26:52 <pikey[m]> Neat :p
15:28:18 <dazinism> pikey: you got anything set up anywhere that may be blocking network connections?
15:29:17 <dazinism> Either so Auditor can't make connections, or possibly blocking connections to attestation.app
15:29:44 <pikey[m]> Not that I know of. I have VPN running but all allowed
15:30:03 <pikey[m]> Hmm unless ...
15:30:07 <pikey[m]> I do have always on VPN
15:30:25 <pikey[m]> meaning no access outside the VPN for anything
15:30:51 <pikey[m]> Which should be fine unless attestation requires native connection below VPN
15:31:33 <pikey[m]> But no. It was working til Saturday (last attestation) and no settings changed since
15:32:11 <pikey[m]> <dazinism "Either so Auditor can't make con"> No definitely not blocking like that
15:32:54 <dazinism> pikey: check somehow you havent accidentally switched network permission for auditor?
15:34:27 <dazinism> Ilm pretty sure Auditor will work fine through a VPN, unless the VPN provider is blocking the connection - which feels unlikely
15:36:41 <pikey[m]> Will have a dig around for those settings. Thanks for the help daz
15:38:40 <pikey[m]> Yep not blocked or anything. Full access to phone and network. Strange. I am switching to new cell network shortly so will seebif that magically cures it. Can't see why but can hope!
15:49:15 <alzxjm[m]1> anupritaisno1: What's the best way to submit a bug report for my Syncthing issue?
15:49:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> Describe it
15:50:18 * alzxjm[m]1 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/suMLBjxrhntFxRGGAAqRfBUI >
15:50:29 <alzxjm[m]1> That seems to be where it quits.
15:50:42 <cyborgninjaneer[> iOS is more secure than unmodified AOSP, more secure and private than OEM Android distros. GrapheneOS is probably most private and possibly most secure as long as you don't use v1 certs
15:51:11 <cyborgninjaneer[> I posted that in the wrong channel
15:52:22 <sheruleeya[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "iOS is more secure than unmodifi"> Welp. Yeah, no regrets having GrapheneOS even if support date for 3a is <2 years

15:53:54 <alzxjm[m]1> anupritaisno1: I get this problem whether I install from F-Droid or Aurora, and Syncthing or Syncthing-Fork. Syncthing (non-Fork) work alright on stock and on CalyxOS
16:33:37 <AdventureCommuni> What's the best 2FA app on Fdroid?
16:34:15 <cn3m[m]> Adventure Communist: Aegis
16:46:23 <dazinism> userman23: its old and I've not used it for a long time
16:46:28 <dazinism> Slight backup (A very simple backup program) - https://f-droid.org/app/de.shandschuh.slightbackup
16:47:08 <dazinism> userman23: also there is
16:47:15 <dazinism> SMS Backup+ (Backup SMS, MMS and call history to Gmail, Google Calendar or IMAP.) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.zegoggles.smssync
16:47:30 <dazinism> But it sends it all to an IMAP server
16:50:26 <dazinism> userman23: lots to consider.
16:50:42 <AdventureCommuni> <cn3m[m] "Adventure Communist: Aegis "> thanks, I like the UI a lot
16:50:53 <dazinism> Does it need loads of permissions, some that are maybe not so necessary
16:51:13 <dazinism> If its open source check the issue tracker
16:51:14 <cn3m[m]> <userman23[m] "When reviewing a new app, how do"> Depends on the app
16:52:58 <dazinism> userman23: for example when looking at the issue tracker for andOTP I found this
16:53:01 <dazinism> https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP/issues/427
16:57:14 <dazinism> Ideally an app can keep some functionality if you don't grant it permissions.
16:57:59 <dazinism> Eg. Storage - many apps loose functionality without granting that, but they could still work
16:58:54 <dazinism> Scoped storage requirements in Android 11 will improve things
16:59:45 <dazinism> If apps have a target SDK 30 they'll have to work without needing storage permission
17:05:41 <AdventureCommuni> Newpipe, OsmAnd+, Open Weather

17:09:40 <nowbody[m]> And what do you all think about Shelter - is it secure enough to isolate WhatsApp from therest of the device?
17:13:46 <bonerdose[m]> Anyone got a nodded gcam apk working on grapheme?

17:21:34 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nowbody[m] "Has Graphene OS any way to disab"> Yes. Works great.
17:21:45 <cn3m[m]> You can disable permissions in the permissions manager
17:21:49 <cn3m[m]> in settings under apps
17:21:58 <cn3m[m]> this gives you a high level overview
17:22:00 <DannyWorkOrderPr> <nowbody[m] "And what do you all think about "> Eh. I'd use/it's recommended to use a separate Android user profile for best results/peace of mind.
17:22:02 <cn3m[m]> you can run gcam on graphene, but you will need the compatibility layer

17:24:08 <cn3m[m]> https://github.com/LumenReaper/Gcam-Services-Provider
17:24:10 <AdventureCommuni> Is there any way to revoke more specific permissions? ie. disable wifi for an app when the screen is off?
17:38:21 <cn3m[m]> <DannyWorkOrderPr "Eh. I'd use/it's recommended to "> user profiles are amazing
17:42:19 <alzxjm[m]1> Is there any way to get a Google Photos PWA on GrapheneOS? Vanadium just tries to prompt an install of the app.
17:42:37 <alzxjm[m]1> On stock, I think all browsers would do it so it might have been the Chrome system WebView.
17:46:35 <cdesai> are you logged into a google account?
17:46:41 <dallemon[m]> <AdventureCommuni "Is there any way to revoke more "> WiFi is not a permission. But GrapheneOS has the network permission.
17:46:56 <alzxjm[m]1> <alzxjm[m]1 "On stock, I think all browsers w"> Nevermind. Not sure why, but it's working now. I navigated to my Gmail inbox, where it gave me the option to use the web version (instead of the app). After that, I went back to photos.google.com and now I can use the PWA.
17:55:28 <sheruleeya[m]> Quite curious though, a certain ISP provider has said that they collect the gesture, swiping data on smartphone through their SIM, besides the network and data consumption behavior (to study the habits of the consumer through using their services).

18:37:18 <cn3m[m]> The SIM doesn't have access to your device
18:37:18 <cn3m[m]> your device has access to the SIM
18:37:36 <cn3m[m]> it uses it as a network essentially much like connecting to WiFi, but with a UID
18:38:09 <nickcalyx[m]> there are additional spyware packages some carriers add to their android distros
18:38:23 <cn3m[m]> If you want to see meaningful modem isolation at work
18:38:23 <nickcalyx[m]> the name of the famous one is escaping me at the moment
18:38:40 <nickcalyx[m]> I think verizon used it
18:39:36 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: sprint forces proprietary code to run iirc
18:40:09 <sheruleeya[m]> <cn3m[m] "nickcalyx: sprint forces proprie"> Is that a reason Sprint wont work in GOS?
18:40:20 <cn3m[m]> <cn3m[m] "If you want to see meaningful mo"> Pixels and iPhones generally have far better modem isolation than the competition. https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1158869170429333504 This is a pretty solid example
18:55:31 <dazinism> The sprint thing is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMA_Device_Management
19:01:58 <cn3m[m]> Google Fi also has issues, but that is tricky since they are by far the most secure
19:04:24 <Jimmehh[m]> has anyone seen this yet?
19:04:24 <Jimmehh[m]> https://security.googleblog.com/2020/06/system-hardening-in-android-11.html
19:04:24 <Jimmehh[m]> i don't really know much about graphene or android in regards to hardening, but i was wondering if this would have an impact on graphene good or bad
19:09:51 <alzxjm[m]1> <cn3m[m] "Google Fi also has issues, but t"> By the way, I use Google Fi on GrapheneOS (as of this morning) with only one issue: MMS doesn't work. This does not really bother me as I don't use MMS, but it is an issue. This does not seem to be GrapheneOS-specific but just Play Services dependent.
19:10:04 <alzxjm[m]1> The other expected things don't work such as network switching and wi-fi calling but I knew that already.
19:10:38 <faxing[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "The other expected things don't "> Wdym network switching doesn't work?
19:10:57 <cn3m[m]> that is probably a feature security wise /s
19:12:02 <alzxjm[m]1> On the stock Pixel OS Google Fi automatically chooses the strongest signal from three networks: T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular. Without Google Play Services (really the Fi app, I think), you are only able to use the T-Mobile network.
19:14:45 <faxing[m]> Oh that's a really awesome feature if it was possible on graphene
19:15:29 <faxing[m]> If I wasn't on graphene that'd be enough for me to switch right there
19:15:32 <skwisgaar[m]> <cn3m[m] "Google Fi also has issues, but t"> I would like to switch to Google Fi for security reasons, but I'm curious what exactly is more secure about it, since they are using T-Mobile networks
19:16:08 <faxing[m]> Yeah, like how is Google Fi more secure than other carriers like Mint Mobile for example
19:16:33 <faxing[m]> I was wondering the same thing
19:16:34 <cn3m[m]> SIM Swapping attacks are essentially impossible on Google Fi
19:17:08 <faxing[m]> Is that really the only thing that makes them more secure than other carriers?
19:17:44 <faxing[m]> Also couldn't you get essentially the same effect by using SIM locking with a pin?
19:18:24 <faxing[m]> * Also how are they better than other carriers with SIM swapping and couldn't you get essentially the same effect by using SIM locking with a pin?
19:22:28 <skwisgaar[m]> I'm sure Google does a much better job with security as far as they have control over the cellular service. But if they are using T-mobile, sprint networks, maybe that security isn't helping very much. Just speculating.
19:22:56 <skwisgaar[m]> It's gotta be better than using a traditional provider.
19:25:20 <alzxjm[m]1> Google Fi is absolutely fantastic. If I don't stick with GrapheneOS it will be because I miss Fi too much.
19:25:39 <alzxjm[m]1> (that is, miss Wi-Fi calling and network switching)
19:26:51 <proof_jr> there a recommended option to clear app cache?
19:27:24 <wreck[m]> i used google fi for a long time, but i've switched to mint mobile for cost reasons, and ported my number back to google voice
19:27:34 <wreck[m]> i'm curious what the security implications of that are thought?

19:28:13 <wreck[m]> good bot
19:28:34 <wreck[m]> i would also assume that google voice won't work properly on grapheneOS
19:30:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW where's the force 90hz option on grapheneos?
19:30:47 <alzxjm[m]1> <anupritaisno1[m] "BTW where's the force 90hz optio"> I was wondering about this too.
19:31:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Swear to god if I don't find it I'm going to hack dt and redirect all refresh rates to 90hz
19:31:45 <alzxjm[m]1> <anupritaisno1[m] "Swear to god if I don't find it "> It's definitely not in the same place as on the stock Developer Options

19:46:59 <sheruleeya[m]> <alzxjm[m]1 "Does anyone here use Bitwarden's"> I don't. KeepassDX's keyboard does the job well enough

19:51:46 <Jimmehh[m]> ah, thanks for that information
19:52:21 <Jimmehh[m]> i've been thinking of going to grapheneos soon once i get a new device, but i'm not sure if i should get a pixel or an iphone se
19:52:27 <cn3m[m]> It is definitely getting more iOS like
19:52:33 <cn3m[m]> I miss that feature and am very excited
19:52:34 <Jimmehh[m]> the one thing that makes me more towards a se is longer support
19:52:55 <Jimmehh[m]> if pixels didn't have such sort support i would probably go with it in a heartbeat
19:53:12 <jcpicard32[m]> Jimmehh: Both are great choices for privacy and security. The iPhone will almost certainly be supported longer.
19:53:17 <cn3m[m]> Both are good options
19:53:18 <jcpicard32[m]> What are your goals in switching?
19:53:25 <cn3m[m]> really comes down to personal preference
19:56:40 <cn3m[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/ekxifpa/ Jimmehh:
19:56:49 <cn3m[m]> this is still a pretty good summary
19:57:00 <Jimmehh[m]> well i want a new phone that i'll be able to use for a while, i want decent privacy(don't wanna use android with gapps), my main focus is security i suppose. i broke it down to two main questions, do i want convenience or maximum freedom and privacy? while i'm more leaning towards convenience at this point because of a few things like imessages and the apple watch. i would love to support the project if possible
19:57:31 <cn3m[m]> the hardware improvements haven't been massive, but iPhones with A13 have basic hardware drm for the screens and the iOS 14 and Android 11 permission systems are both going to be better
19:57:32 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you want a balance of convenience, security, and privacy, iPhone.
19:58:13 <Jimmehh[m]> i would for sure get an a12 or above, no way i'm getting anything lower because of checkm8
19:58:32 <Jimmehh[m]> i already have an 8 plus that i'll use for dev stuff
19:58:35 <cyborgninjaneer[> If you want to be part of the open source community and sacrifice some convenience to avoid big tech and possibly have slightly better security, go with GrapheneOS.
19:59:45 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "i would for sure get an a12 or a"> I don't worry about checkm8 at all. You should always reboot an unattended phone
19:59:46 <jcpicard32[m]> At this point in time an iPhone involves giving up very little to get a private and secure system. I use both daily and like both a lot. If you are okay with giving up some convenience GrapheneOS can possibly give better privacy and security depending on how you set things up.
19:59:59 <Jimmehh[m]> i think my main problem with going with grapheneos is communication, everyone i know uses sms, imessages, or snapchat. obviously two of those are not gonna be available on grapheneos. i've got a few people to use signal for a little, but i feel like it only made it not want to contact me
20:00:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> Snapchat is cancer
20:01:01 <cn3m[m]> iOS vs GrapheneOS security is complicated. For the average person iOS is notably more secure for now due to the store, better permissions, and the fact people don't bother to setup remote attestation. The link I shared Daniel goes into that a little more
20:01:09 <Jimmehh[m]> i would prefer not to use sms for communicating with friends since while it's not really an issue, i would prefer to keep discussions as private as possible
20:01:18 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS was largely a freedom choice for it and the first party privacy is excellent
20:01:22 <cyborgninjaneer[> SMS is last resort, iMessage is a good fallback if your contacts don't have Signal
20:01:34 <cn3m[m]> I prefer the hardware on the Pixels too
20:01:38 <cn3m[m]> <Jimmehh[m] "i already have an 8 plus that i'"> 8 plus is still fine imo
20:01:51 <cyborgninjaneer[> iPhones have better camera software.
20:02:08 <cn3m[m]> That is the A11 so it has most of the massive leaps in hardening and full support for iOS 14
20:02:16 <Jimmehh[m]> i would feel better if it were a newer phone, plus i mainly use my 8 plus for jailbreaking stuff and app development
20:02:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> You can contribute code to GrapheneOS though. You'll never get that opportunity on iOS
20:02:45 <cn3m[m]> You should always reboot a device after leaving it unattended checkm8 or not
20:03:02 <cyborgninjaneer[> You can technically build and sideload apps on either one. You need Xcode to do it on iOS
20:03:08 <Jimmehh[m]> i never keep my phone unattended unless i'm sleeping
20:03:18 <cn3m[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "You can contribute code to Graph"> iOS has a lot of open source code(more than not)

20:10:54 <cn3m[m]> It is on the latest generation chip and simply blows everything else out of the water security wise for the hardware. They have a lot of room to improve, but the lead is notable
20:10:57 <jcpicard32[m]> Same. Hard to justify not upgrading my iPhone to it given the low price and latest hardware
20:11:18 <jcpicard32[m]> I have an 8 as my main iPhone so not terrible but the SE would be a step up
20:12:55 <cn3m[m]> I would wait until the release of the iPhone 12 we could see if they add anything to the A14 spec for security or even strengthen the drm

20:23:53 <cn3m[m]> my suggestion is that it should take 5 seconds to turn on if verification fails
20:24:01 <cn3m[m]> this doesn't brick the device and it doesn't allow the screen to fake validation

20:25:11 <sheruleeya[m]> Oh.
20:25:35 <cn3m[m]> If the iPhone couldn't verify the screen so it took 5 seconds to boot you would be able to know that it was modified and that is not something the screen could effect and hide
20:25:45 <cn3m[m]> ideally that would go for all parts
20:26:13 <cn3m[m]> iPhones do this in other ways like breaking TouchID or FaceID with modifications

20:37:32 <cn3m[m]> Google I like with the Pixels because they pretty much do this to do the right thing. Apple is doing it to protect users, developers, and them. Piracy is a huge problem with jailbreaking and that is the main reason the iPhone is so secure. You still haven't seen a persistent exploit on any version of iOS(even out of date) since 2016. Apple has way more reason to secure their devices
20:37:41 <greenmoon[m]> You may interested about reading it
20:37:54 <cn3m[m]> Google mainly does it to be cool. Just patching monthly puts them 10x better than everyone else all this fancy stuff is just icing on the cake

20:41:20 <cn3m[m]> TheJollyRoger: no there is no reason the Titan M can't control the display

20:59:41 <cn3m[m]> Scudo is actually attempting to harden which is essentially the opposite of jemalloc. Probably somewhere in the middle
21:04:45 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: I suggest reading the Auditor documentation
21:05:07 <strcat[m]> and read the output
21:05:26 <strcat[m]> whether it shows red / yellow / green is based on the result which is written in the output
21:05:37 <strcat[m]> the color doesn't give any additional information, it already says everything in the output
21:05:44 <strcat[m]> so you don't need to ask what the color means or why
21:05:57 <strcat[m]> maybe I should remove that because people are repeatedly confused by it
21:06:15 <strcat[m]> although it's just meant to reinforce what the output text is saying
21:07:00 <strcat[m]> greenmoon: scudo isn't hardened in the same sense as hardened_malloc, it has inline metadata with weak probabilistic protection, etc.
21:07:13 <strcat[m]> it's just not completely security oblivious like fully performance-oriented allocators
21:07:22 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: don't know why
21:07:28 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: you understand it's based on trust on first use right?
21:07:43 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: the output explained that it was the initial pairing with weak verification - why is the yellow background confusing?
21:07:50 <strcat[m]> what do you expect for a weak initial pairing?
21:07:56 <strcat[m]> I think you're confused about what it did
21:08:02 <strcat[m]> you need to read the documentation and output
21:08:39 <strcat[m]> the background color always matches what the text output says
21:08:57 <strcat[m]> green -> strong paired verification, yellow -> initial weak verification, red -> failure

21:10:01 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: what do you mean it happened quite a few times?
21:10:23 <strcat[m]> failure shouldn't ever happen
21:10:41 <strcat[m]> unless you screw up the initial pairing and then it has a special hand-written explanation of what you probably did wrong
21:10:44 <strcat[m]> and how to resolve it
21:11:17 <strcat[m]> single it's based on QR code scanning the Auditee doesn't know if you actually scanned it from the Auditor
21:11:32 <strcat[m]> if you stop halfway and don't complete the initial pairing
21:11:37 <strcat[m]> then all verifications after that will fail
21:11:58 <strcat[m]> and it explains why (although it notes an attacker could be responsible for it since if it's SUPPOSED to be paired already that indicates compromise)
21:12:20 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: verify again and you'll see it says it's a strong paired verification
21:12:37 <strcat[m]> since it has pinned the hardware-backed key and the attestation certificate chain
21:12:40 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: no
21:12:46 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: you're confused
21:13:00 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: only the Auditee needs to be on the supported list
21:13:11 <strcat[m]> defconanon010102: and you seem to be missing that the verification is based on pairing (trust on first use)
21:13:30 <strcat[m]> the first verification cannot be a strong one - it is not paired
21:13:40 <strcat[m]> you are supposed to verify once to get them paired
21:13:51 <strcat[m]> and then AFTER THAT POINT it has strong detection of compromises
21:14:04 <strcat[m]> if the device was compromised BEFORE you ever paired it, then it can only do a weak check for compromise
21:14:07 <strcat[m]> it's based on pairing
21:14:32 <strcat[m]> it's doing a strong verification that the device was not compromised / swapped AFTER your initial pairing with it
21:17:33 <strcat[m]> yes but you should really just read what is written in the output
21:17:35 <strcat[m]> and the documentation
21:17:45 <strcat[m]> the color is ENTIRELY redundant, it communicates no additional information not conveyed via text
21:18:09 <strcat[m]> I could remove the background color change and it wouldn't make any difference to what the app communicates
21:18:11 <strcat[m]> understand? just read
21:18:20 <strcat[m]> you don't need the background color explained to you like this - you could have just ignored it and read the output
21:18:28 <strcat[m]> shrug
21:18:43 <strcat[m]> I don't know why your main concern is the color

21:28:29 <bend[m]> just to be clear: preferably dont use any sim at all?
21:29:44 <sheruleeya[m]> Depends on your threat model, if companies are one of your higher threat models.
21:29:44 <sheruleeya[m]> But yes, not use sim at all would be the best to avoid triangulation. If cannot be avoided (to use sim), use airplane mode when not needed.

21:45:54 <nickcalyx[m]> sheruleeya:  I'm not sure that even works.   because even without a sim the phone can still register with the towers and you can generally still call 911 or whatever the emergency services number is in your area
21:46:04 <nickcalyx[m]> so they can still triangulate you with or without a sim probably
21:46:35 <nickcalyx[m]> the sim is just needed to do things that cost money, like make (non emergency) phone calls or pass data etc

22:19:09 <strcat[m]> airplane mode is as good as it gets

22:21:48 <strcat[m]> we just need to deal with the linux kernel's non-private 'privacy addresses' implementation perhaps by disabling it
22:22:11 <strcat[m]> if airplane mode is on, the cellular radio is off

23:01:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> Does Android do Ethernet natively?
23:01:34 <strcat[m]> sure but that hardly qualifies as a mobile phone
23:01:48 <strcat[m]> and again
23:01:49 <sheruleeya[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "Does Android do Ethernet nativel"> Need an adaptor for that, but it works for me.
23:01:52 <strcat[m]> not sure what is accomplished
23:02:01 <strcat[m]> people need to think in terms of a threat model
23:02:07 <strcat[m]> not just make up random things that don't make sense
23:02:07 <hypokeimenon[m]> true
23:02:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Nothing
23:02:18 <strcat[m]> so we are talking about a device that is compromised
23:02:30 <strcat[m]> so it doesn't have a connection to the network right now? big deal, can still track your location and record it
23:02:34 <strcat[m]> and just exfiltrate that later
23:02:37 <cn3m[m]> That is what I don't get about the Snowden mods
23:02:42 <strcat[m]> what difference does it make if it doesn't currently have a network connection
23:02:45 <cn3m[m]> it is a lot more data on my phone than that stuff will collect
23:03:02 <strcat[m]> so they can grab all the data on your device
23:03:07 <strcat[m]> and use all the inputs/outputs that are available
23:03:22 <strcat[m]> what good does it do to temporarily not have a network connection?
23:03:32 <strcat[m]> what is the threat model?
23:03:58 <hypokeimenon[m]> depends on how many of the sensors you can mod out though
23:04:21 <strcat[m]> they still get all your data from their persistent compromise
23:04:28 <cn3m[m]> I don
23:04:30 <strcat[m]> they can record all your calls / conversations via the phone
23:04:44 <strcat[m]> there are other ways to track location than cellular
23:04:58 <strcat[m]> you don't have a threat model you're working from
23:05:01 <strcat[m]> it's just meaningless
23:05:04 <cn3m[m]> can't sensors do that to some degree? I thought I read a paper on that years ago
23:05:14 <strcat[m]> cn3m: sure, and audio
23:05:17 <strcat[m]> being able to play sound
23:05:33 <hypokeimenon[m]> btw I'm not sure about the assumption that the phone is compromised I think that's more what nickcalyx was pondering
23:05:36 <strcat[m]> is enough to track location in stores deploying location tracking technologies
23:05:45 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: ok so if it's not compromised airplane mode works
23:05:47 <strcat[m]> what's the problem?
23:06:53 <strcat[m]> if you want to talk about airplane mode not being enough you're saying the device is deeply compromised
23:07:17 <hypokeimenon[m]> It's not a massive problem it's just that there isn't the option
23:07:29 <strcat[m]> airplane mode turns off the cellular radio
23:07:35 <strcat[m]> that's the option
23:07:40 <hypokeimenon[m]> there are some modem-less Linux devices though I think
23:07:52 <strcat[m]> nope
23:07:53 <JTL> With their own share of design issues
23:07:53 <strcat[m]> they have wifi
23:07:56 <strcat[m]> wifi is a modem too
23:07:57 <cn3m[m]> If you can't trust your hardware and your OS you are screwed badly
23:08:01 <strcat[m]> wifi has a comparable implementation
23:08:08 <strcat[m]> and it doesn't pose different problems in this regard
23:08:10 <hypokeimenon[m]> If you find the other stuff extraneous you can't pick up a good modem-less phone off the shelf
23:08:21 <wreck[m]> i mean, just line an otterbox with copper foil and keep your phone in there until you need it if you're that concerned
23:08:34 <strcat[m]> hypokeimenon: I'm not aware of a phone without radios
23:08:47 <strcat[m]> again, wifi is not different in this regard
23:08:56 <strcat[m]> you're very confused if you think so
23:08:59 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much sense
23:09:03 <sheruleeya[m]> <wreck[m] "i mean, just line an otterbox wi"> or not use a sim/wifi, and always in airplane mode?
23:09:06 <strcat[m]> it can even broadcast on overlapping frequencies if it's compromised
23:09:13 <strcat[m]> using a SIM has nothing to do with it
23:09:29 <strcat[m]> not using wifi has nothing to do with it
23:11:15 <strcat[m]> if the device is compromised to the point that airplane mode doesn't work, wifi is usable for the same things as cellular by an attacker
23:11:52 <strcat[m]> if the device isn't compromised airplane mode works
23:12:06 <strcat[m]> so I don't know what people are talking about
23:12:07 <wreck[m]> you all are talking about not needing a sim to triangulate coordinates, and taking this to major extremes... the only way around that is a faraday cage
23:12:37 <strcat[m]> wifi is usable to quickly detect location
23:12:54 <strcat[m]> also not sure why we're talking about that when there's GPS and motion / direction sensors
23:13:09 <strcat[m]> really don't understand where people come up with this stuff
23:13:19 <sheruleeya[m]> Oh.
23:13:19 <sheruleeya[m]> On another note, how come SIM providers are able to collect swiping, gesture data, and other behavioral data on users?
23:13:24 <strcat[m]> really warped ideas about privacy and security not based on a threat model or critical thinking
23:13:37 <strcat[m]> sheruleeya: they aren't, where are you coming up with that?
23:13:47 <strcat[m]>  * sheruleeya: they aren't, why are you coming up with that?
23:13:48 <sheruleeya[m]> Not sure why they said that tbh
23:14:08 <strcat[m]> who did
23:14:49 <sheruleeya[m]> The sim providers themselves have provided that info, that they collect behavioral data based on usage
23:14:49 <sheruleeya[m]> My country's (one of)/main telecommunication provider
23:14:57 <sheruleeya[m]> Well, I understand if it's based on mobile data and texts/calls
23:14:59 <strcat[m]> no that's not how SIM cards work
23:15:25 <strcat[m]> you're confused
23:15:33 <sheruleeya[m]> * The sim providers themselves have provided that info, that they collect behavioral data based on usage
23:15:33 <sheruleeya[m]> My country's (one of) main telecommunication provider on their seminar about "big data is new oil"
23:15:58 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, I am, and I couldn't connect the dots there. Probably it has something to do with their apps instead.
23:15:58 <strcat[m]> if you're connected to a cellular network persistently then obviously the provider knows where you are and can build a record of your location
23:16:02 <strcat[m]> has nothing to do with SIM cards
23:16:11 <strcat[m]> sheruleeya: I think you're just confused
23:16:30 <strcat[m]> SIM cards are how you authenticate with a network
23:16:45 <strcat[m]> they are a little secure element and don't do much
23:16:56 <strcat[m]> some SIM cards have applets for the OS to use
23:17:01 <strcat[m]> the OS is in full control of that
23:17:11 <strcat[m]> that's what SIM Toolkit exposes
23:17:23 <strcat[m]> lets not go into fairy tales about SIM cards
23:17:44 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah, better not.
23:18:48 <sheruleeya[m]> * Yeah, better not.
23:18:48 <sheruleeya[m]> Kinda sad that the providers themselves deliberately misinformed us of this stuff
23:19:09 <sheruleeya[m]> * Yeah, better not.
23:19:09 <sheruleeya[m]> Kinda sad that the providers themselves deliberately misinformed us of this stuff (i mean on my side here)
23:20:19 <strcat[m]> you don't need a SIM card to use cellular
23:20:24 <hypokeimenon[m]> can you link the seminar?
23:20:26 <strcat[m]> SIM card is how providers do authenticationm
23:20:30 <strcat[m]>  * SIM card is how providers do authentication
23:20:34 <strcat[m]> because it's a paid service
23:20:43 <strcat[m]> other than 911 calls
23:20:49 <sheruleeya[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "can you link the seminar?"> It's not online sadly. It was a physical seminar in the past.
23:22:08 <sheruleeya[m]> All I had knew about them is they collect personally identifiable data and "anonymous" data through using their service according to their privacy policy.
23:22:37 <sheruleeya[m]> Wasn't thoroughly explained how they exactly did it though, mostly just the statistical part of the "data analytics"
23:23:45 <cdesai> it could be via some app they ask you to install
23:24:04 <strcat[m]> people mostly use phones from carriers in the US
23:24:08 <strcat[m]> they don't buy a phone and then buy service for it
23:24:19 <cdesai> Carriers and ISPs here are pushing their apps hard, I was trying to change my internet plan through customer service and the website but both options pushed to their app.
23:24:19 <strcat[m]> again a SIM card is just a little secure element, it's not privileged
23:24:31 <strcat[m]> it provides authentication with the network and the OS can choose if it wants to use applets provided by the SIM card
23:24:38 <strcat[m]> and those applets have very few capabilities
23:24:46 <strcat[m]> they can only do what the OS chooses to do with them
23:25:10 <strcat[m]> the most powerful thing they can do is open a URL in the browser, if the OS chooses to allow them to do it
23:25:15 <strcat[m]> that is what SIM Toolkit is used for as I said
23:25:17 <strcat[m]> using those applets
23:25:26 <strcat[m]> because a lot of legacy things piggybacked on SIM cards
23:25:33 <strcat[m]> like banking, etc.
23:25:38 <strcat[m]> because it's a little secure element for authentication
23:27:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> If Lawful Access to Encrypted Data passes in the US, will GrapheneOS still be able to provide non-US users with strong encryption?
23:27:33 <strcat[m]> sure why not?
23:27:36 <sheruleeya[m]> Thanks for the clarification.
23:27:41 <strcat[m]> we don't sell anything to americans
23:27:57 <strcat[m]> we have no business and we have no presence in the US
23:28:09 <JTL> strcat and quite a few other people here are based in canada
23:28:28 <strcat[m]> our servers are in Canada hosted by a company in France
23:28:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> Just wondered if you were located in the US and might get into trouble
23:28:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> Okay
23:28:57 <JTL> what I'd be more concerned with down the line if something like this were to pass putting the onus on hardware manufacturers to sabotage security or whatever. And now I take off my tinfoil hat.
23:29:02 <strcat[m]> lots of companies are based on the US though
23:29:13 <strcat[m]> and non-profits
23:29:16 <JTL> ^
23:29:16 <strcat[m]> including Tor and Signal
23:29:31 <strcat[m]> and they are subject to US law including existing lawful access requests / orders
23:29:49 <cn3m[m]> I wonder how this would effect root of trust and certs
23:30:01 <strcat[m]> the US government has ordered US companies to turn over keys before
23:30:22 <cn3m[m]> Lavabit comes to mind
23:31:37 <cyborgninjaneer[> So if Google breaks security GrapheneOS will have to fix it?
23:31:46 <strcat[m]> ??
23:32:06 <cyborgninjaneer[> Hopefully all the tech companies bail on the US if they pass that shit.
23:32:18 <TheJollyRoger> What do you mean "If Google breaks security?"
23:32:26 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: and go where instead
23:32:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> If they add back doors to AOSP
23:32:35 <sheruleeya[m]> <cyborgninjaneer[ "So if Google breaks security Gra"> Not sure what you meant there, but if you mean putting backdoor on encryption like andoid...
23:32:49 <sheruleeya[m]> * Not sure what you meant there, but if you mean putting backdoor on encryption om andoid...
23:32:57 <sheruleeya[m]> * Not sure what you meant there, but if you mean putting backdoor on encryption om andoid...
23:33:18 <TheJollyRoger> This is where I need to make an image macro consisting of two parts:
23:33:20 <cyborgninjaneer[> Have to patch them out I guess
23:33:21 <sheruleeya[m]> Which should be easily caught since AOSP is open source?
23:33:34 <sheruleeya[m]> * Not sure what you meant there, but if you mean putting backdoor on encryption on Android...
23:33:42 <cdesai> strcat[m]: does repo handle submodules well?
23:33:49 <strcat[m]> cdesai: dunno
23:33:59 <strcat[m]> cdesai: it just doesn't do anything with them by default
23:34:06 <strcat[m]> it looks like there's support for syncing them too
23:34:07 <strcat[m]> but I haven't used it
23:34:13 <cdesai> yeah I noticed that
23:34:18 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: Google is hardly the only company based in the US
23:34:23 <cdesai> I just put them in separate git repos, moved off subtree
23:34:29 <strcat[m]> Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, AMD, etc
23:34:37 <TheJollyRoger> Actually, nevermind. >_<.
23:34:39 <strcat[m]> lots of non-profits like Tor and Signal among others
23:34:57 <strcat[m]> the laws don't apply unequally to Google they apply the same way to every company there
23:35:32 <sheruleeya[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Actually, nevermind. >_<."> Go on though ^^
23:36:03 <cyborgninjaneer[> Idk how US jurisdiction would affect open source projects. I know all of those companies will be compromised by design. Just wondering how FOSS would be affected. Will US isps block them?
23:36:25 <strcat[m]> I mean, you're talking about some theoretical law that hasn't been proposed
23:36:27 <TheJollyRoger> Well, for a macro, I was thinking that I should make a meme image in two parts, the first part would be a picture of computer code in an IDE, and have the caption "Contribute to improving and maintaining open source." and then in the second part, have a picture of the NSA emblem with the caption "Before they do."
23:36:30 <nickcalyx[m]> > Lavabit comes to mind
23:36:30 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm friends with Ladar and I love the guy even though there's lots of things we don't agree,on,but I  don't think,he handled his legal situation well
23:36:33 <sheruleeya[m]> Better petition it not to pass though
23:36:37 <strcat[m]> so why theorize about the US in particular right now
23:36:59 <strcat[m]> sounds like you're very misinformed about what the EARN-IT act does
23:37:16 <strcat[m]> and are panicking about what you imagine it to be about
23:37:19 <cyborgninjaneer[> I'm not talking about EARN-IT.
23:37:25 <strcat[m]> okay then what are you talking about
23:37:26 <TheJollyRoger> Oh yes. strcat, I wanted to ask, uh...
23:37:32 <strcat[m]> and why not propose say, Canada passes this law
23:37:39 <strcat[m]> why the US
23:37:45 <TheJollyRoger> I ended up with a Pixel 4XL case by mistake. ordered the wrong item.
23:37:45 <cyborgninjaneer[> New bill in the US Senate judiciary comittee
23:37:59 <cyborgninjaneer[> "Lawful access to encrypted data"
23:38:02 <TheJollyRoger> Do you want to take it? It's almost as much money as it is to return it, as the case is worth.
23:38:15 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: so why are you talking about hidden backdoors?
23:38:23 <cyborgninjaneer[> Not hidden.
23:38:48 <strcat[m]> you know Australia and other places already have these laws
23:38:57 <strcat[m]> renlord is in Australia
23:39:41 <cyborgninjaneer[> Guess it won't matter for open source then, which makes me wonder why they bother legislating this stuff
23:39:49 <renlord> hi
23:40:02 <sheruleeya[m]> hi
23:40:14 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: why wouldn't it matter?
23:40:23 <renlord> a humorous youtube clip on our backdoor laws: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW-OMR-iWOE
23:40:33 <renlord> quite factual really.
23:41:00 <strcat[m]> cyborgninjaneer: people in the US won't be able to produce products with proper encryption
23:41:01 <renlord> the acronym is brilliant
23:41:05 <strcat[m]> it's not specific to companies or closed source software
23:41:11 <strcat[m]> but it's not about putting a hidden backdoor
23:41:56 <strcat[m]> also what makes you think the EU and others won't pass similar laws?
23:43:08 <JTL> It is certainlly concerning that some other jurisdictions already have these laws
23:43:11 <renlord> something as ambigious as assaccess? 100%
23:43:14 <renlord> every country will pass it
23:43:16 <renlord> LOL
23:43:50 <renlord> but since its so ambigious, 9 out of 10 times you probably can go to court to dispute
23:44:17 <sheruleeya[m]> -chuckles-
23:44:17 <sheruleeya[m]> My right's in danger
23:45:08 <sheruleeya[m]> * -chuckles-
23:45:08 <sheruleeya[m]> Our right's in danger
23:46:21 <sheruleeya[m]> <strcat[m] "also what makes you think the EU"> Likelihood is lower, but nonzero? As of now, they had better privacy laws there though
23:47:07 <sheruleeya[m]> But then, government can easily change, and generally desire to preserve power, thus government is adversary (\s)
23:47:07 <strcat[m]> sheruleeya: better privacy laws regulating CORPORATIONS in the EU, yes
23:47:21 <strcat[m]> what makes you think there are tighter laws on government surveillance?
23:48:12 <sheruleeya[m]> Nothing?
23:48:13 <renlord> sheruleeya[m]: do you live in a country where you dont get to vote?
23:49:00 <sheruleeya[m]> Nah, just living in a third world country where our privacy is always in danger thanks to our neighboring countries
23:49:19 <concat[m]> <renlord "sheruleeya: do you live in a cou"> Actually all countries don't allow voting unless you're in the proper age.
23:50:09 <sheruleeya[m]> * Nah, just living in a third world country where our privacy and rights are always in danger thanks to our neighboring countries and government who don't exactly do their job.
23:50:23 <concat[m]> Some citizenships as well, iirc
23:51:19 <sheruleeya[m]> * Nah, just living in a third world country where our privacy and rights are always in danger thanks to our neighboring countries and government who don't exactly do their job.
23:51:19 <sheruleeya[m]> Also, purposely having bad education system (and hastily implementing "world-competent" curriculum due to export oriented nature) to keep (the remaining) people ignorant.
23:51:29 <concat[m]> So like the question should be phrased to "are you prohibited to voting due to specific circumstances in your country" or what not
23:51:39 <renlord> sheruleeya[m]: privacy and rights in danger due to neighbouring country? @_@
23:51:39 <concat[m]>  * So like the question should be phrased to "are you prohibited for voting due to specific circumstances in your country" or what not
23:51:55 <renlord> are you an indian spooked by china?
23:52:18 <strcat[m]> many US states don't allow felons to vote
23:52:19 <sheruleeya[m]> could be, somewhere near the commies
23:52:54 <renlord> sheruleeya[m]: i dont know why you'd feel threatened by china when it almost has zero/no impact on your rights and privacy.
23:53:12 <renlord> you should probably be more concerned about your incumbent government than china.
23:53:28 <concat[m]>  * So like the question should be phrased to "are you prohibited fromvoting due to specific circumstances in your country" or what not
23:53:32 <concat[m]>  * So like the question should be phrased to "are you prohibited from voting due to specific circumstances in your country" or what not
23:53:33 <sheruleeya[m]> Well, not exactly threatened to china per se, but on its influence on the incumbent government itself
23:53:45 <concat[m]> <strcat[m] "many US states don't allow felon"> Right, that too
23:54:32 <renlord> sheruleeya[m]: if it is a national sentiment to confront china, then shouldn't your democratic elections reflect this in the election results
23:55:14 <renlord> strcat[m]: the USA is quite messed up from an aussie's point of view
23:55:34 <sheruleeya[m]> Probably...
23:55:34 <sheruleeya[m]> There's already a law in the making that extends surveillance
23:56:05 <sheruleeya[m]> That's all. Won't give too much info not to reveal too much
23:56:25 <sheruleeya[m]> Not exactly to break encryption, but it's somehow going there
23:57:48 <renlord> unless they censor the whole internet to a greater extent than china (i.e. disallowing VPN usage), there are ways to circumvent
23:57:58 <renlord> heck, even most chinese circumvent using VPN.
23:58:21 <sheruleeya[m]> Yeah. At least, internet is still safe
23:58:35 <sheruleeya[m]> And VPN too
23:58:48 <renlord> on efficacy of law enforcement in india though, i doubt it'd be enforced even if it was legislated.
23:59:11 <cn3m[m]> renlord: I love that video
