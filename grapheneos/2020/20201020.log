00:00:10 <esec2[m]> Also check environment variables and path. If fastboot works everywhere except in the script there's probably a soft link used, or script pointing to custom location.
00:00:20 <esec2[m]> <graphenefan "or if you can't figure the env p"> What he said
00:08:06 <M8942w[m]> ok. I did not understand "$env:Path" and what the directory is in GrapheneOS/install. so i looked up a vid to help me understand and they told me what to do put did not tell me what those terms mean
00:08:29 <M8942w[m]>  * ok. I did not understand "$env:Path" and what the directory is in GrapheneOS/install. so i looked up a vid to help me understand and they told me what to do but did not tell me what those terms mean
00:10:40 <aeonsolution[m]> 8942w: i can help explain
00:11:13 <aeonsolution[m]> the video you are probably watching isnt explaining why you need to keep one powershell window open when you set the path
00:11:16 <M8942w[m]> I think PATH means the file address put in the command
00:11:24 <Partyush[m]> Is it possible to downgrade from beta version to stable one in Graphene os ?
00:12:17 <aeonsolution[m]> the official instructions go through the steps using just one tgerminal shell for linux/macos or one powershell window on win10
00:12:28 <entry1[m]> Yeah the videos by Techlore and The Hated One aren't that great to go by. Its much easier to read the install instructions on the official GrapheneOS website and do it all in powershell for win10
00:12:37 <aeonsolution[m]> so my advise
00:12:49 <aeonsolution[m]> delete the folders you have downloaded already
00:12:58 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "I think PATH means the file addr"> PATH is a environmental variable. On Unix systems you can check this with $PATH. EG echo $PATH
00:13:07 <aeonsolution[m]> close all your windows
00:13:20 <aeonsolution[m]> and open 1 powershell window
00:13:38 <aeonsolution[m]> that powershell window is all you need to download the required files and flash your device
00:13:50 <aeonsolution[m]> let me know when you do that
00:13:52 <esec2[m]> Listen to aeonsolution, he knows. I'll correct him if he screws up lol
00:15:01 <M8942w[m]> get rid of zip files to?
00:15:23 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
00:15:27 <aeonsolution[m]> everything
00:15:31 <entry1[m]> aeonsolution helped me about a few months back. Was doing the same things watching videos and trying out cmd instead of the copy and paste power shell commands on the grapheneos install page. Just make sure to put .exe after curl and to put the correct image file in the command
00:16:01 <aeonsolution[m]> you'll understand after we finish why
00:16:29 <esec2[m]> Starting from scratch like suggested.might be quickest and most painless. Don't ruin his flow
00:17:57 <M8942w[m]> ok everything is gone but this browser and powershell of course
00:18:15 <aeonsolution[m]> cool
00:18:54 <aeonsolution[m]> in powershell type the command `cd ~/Downloads`
00:19:27 <aeonsolution[m]> it will move into your Downloads folders
00:19:30 <aeonsolution[m]> from there
00:19:48 <aeonsolution[m]> follow the steps on here https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-fastboot to get fastboot
00:20:41 <aeonsolution[m]> remember not to close your powershell or open up new ones
00:24:07 <M8942w[m]> should i type in "fastboot --version" now? and what does "curl.exe -O" mean?
00:24:22 <esec2[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "remember not to close your power"> This point is about variables. Either set in script, environment or that specific shell.
00:25:19 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "should i type in "fastboot --ver"> don't mind the exe stuff. Follow aeonsolutions instructions we'll take the questions when you're done
00:26:29 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "should i type in "fastboot --ver"> curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
00:26:45 <esec2[m]> Write that in your same powershell window
00:26:54 <M8942w[m]> oh sorry I forgot to say that I put in the command cd ~/Downloads
00:28:02 <esec2[m]> curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip

00:28:02 <esec2[m]> tar xvf platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip
00:28:59 <aeonsolution[m]> cool, just follow the steps
00:29:45 <M8942w[m]> ok so i put "curl.exe -O https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r30.0.4-windows.zip' in to powershell now right?
00:30:24 <esec2[m]> Yes
00:30:29 <esec2[m]> Same window
00:31:01 <esec2[m]> This will download the zip file in the link if that makes sense
00:31:09 <M8942w[m]> ok did it

00:33:31 <aeonsolution[m]> if you unzipped already yes

02:11:11 <M8942w[m]> ya so i do not know why the vid did not work but now i know better
02:11:50 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "ya so i do not know why the vid "> Where was the video posted and by whom?
02:13:35 <esec2[m]> Check out your setup and familiarize yourself with the clean environment :). Try to stick with f-droid and f-droid repositories and not thrash down your phone with all kinds of proprietary software apks
02:15:02 <esec2[m]> * Check out your setup and familiarize yourself with the clean environment :). Try to stick with f-droid and f-droid repositories and not trash down your phone with all kinds of proprietary software apks
02:15:26 <louipc> i would say stay away from fdroid
02:15:36 <louipc> fdroid has bad packaging practices
02:15:38 <dazinism> 8942w: this may be useful https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
02:15:55 <M8942w[m]> the hated one and techlore. everyone else seemed to follow there vid and was fine
02:16:06 <louipc> get apps from the developer themselves or through aurora store
02:16:24 <louipc> and fdroid app/server itself is slow and buggy
02:16:51 <esec2[m]> <louipc "get apps from the developer them"> Aurora Droid uses f-droid repositories? What's the real difference?
02:17:04 <louipc> no it uses play store
02:17:04 <dazinism> Found the foxy droid app works pretty good
02:17:16 <louipc> oh aurora droid
02:17:22 <dazinism> Theres lots of other fdroid repos also
02:17:24 <louipc> theres another aurora that uses play store
02:17:44 <louipc> yea but avoid the main fdroid repo
02:17:57 <dazinism> Aurora Store or Aurora Droid
02:18:02 <esec2[m]> <esec2[m] "Aurora Droid uses f-droid reposi"> Yeah, Aurora Droid imports from F-droid. Aurora Store is the play store front..
02:18:06 <louipc> aurora store
02:18:18 <louipc> fdroid app is still buggy anyway. given their packaging practices i would not trust them
02:18:31 <esec2[m]> Makes no.sense
02:18:43 <esec2[m]> To me at least
02:19:04 <louipc> they sign all apps themselves and use bad signatures and API version
02:19:11 <esec2[m]> Follow Graphene best practice, will get you far
02:19:15 <M8942w[m]> aurora store got it thank you
02:19:23 <louipc> the proper way is for each developer to sign their own app
02:19:38 <LinusSexTips[m]> aurora droid has a bunch of other repositories by default, too
02:19:39 <louipc> if fdroid gets compromised that means all your fdroid apps are compromised
02:19:40 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "aurora store got it thank you"> Aurora droid, not store. Very important
02:19:54 <LinusSexTips[m]> aurora store is fine
02:20:11 <dazinism> A few apps in the fdroid repo do have developers sigs
02:20:13 <LinusSexTips[m]> if they need play store apps
02:20:20 <louipc> well i guess aurora droid could be better than fdroid :p
02:20:26 <graphenefan> >if fdroid gets compromised that means all your fdroid apps are compromised  not really. how so?
02:20:33 <LinusSexTips[m]> looks better, too
02:20:37 <LinusSexTips[m]> fdroid has an ugly ui imo
02:20:44 <louipc> graphenefan: because fdroid does their own builds and signs them
02:20:49 <esec2[m]> <louipc "if fdroid gets compromised that "> Personally I use repositories that suits my needs. Never had any issues with bad content in packages etc from official fdroid repos
02:21:14 <graphenefan> yes but you need to re-download the apps
02:21:24 <graphenefan> with a pwned signature
02:21:28 <dazinism> I find Aurora Droid a bit buggy. Best experience has been with Foxy Droid
02:21:46 <esec2[m]> Avoid GSF dependent bs as much as possible.
02:22:13 <esec2[m]> Haha bet this pissing contest makes sense for 89 here
02:22:29 <graphenefan> louipc if your threat model is f-droid getting malicious, then...
02:22:32 <louipc> anyway.. best for offtopic by now
02:22:43 <LinusSexTips[m]> <dazinism "I find Aurora Droid a bit buggy."> It used to be quite buggy but seems better recently
02:22:54 <louipc> my threat model is this is all fun in games
02:22:58 <M8942w[m]> im in set up and it is asking me if i want to allow apps to use my location info. will apps still ask me latter to know my location?
02:23:18 <LinusSexTips[m]> they will still ask
02:23:26 <LinusSexTips[m]> so its fine to enable if you want
02:23:31 <dazinism> ???
02:23:39 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "im in set up and it is asking me"> Use Google or read the manual for these types of questions 😉
02:23:49 <graphenefan> just don't set auto-update in both fdroid, aurora, shit* you have, wait for a week, and if it doesn't hit the fan you are ok
02:23:54 <graphenefan> isnt it right?
02:24:32 <esec2[m]> <graphenefan "just don't set auto-update in bo"> Yeah having a conflict and apps competing to be first to update is a Royal Pain
02:24:45 <M8942w[m]> ok ill leave you guy then. thank you again
02:24:56 <graphenefan> i dont know any app that will stop working if you dont update it for a week. but then you can see a backdoor
02:25:07 <esec2[m]> <M8942w[m] "ok ill leave you guy then. thank"> Stick around. Maybe you can help?
02:25:57 <M8942w[m]> i got to go eat. see you guys latter
02:27:48 <esec2[m]> So.. that was fun. Everything allright with you girls? :😀
02:29:13 <graphenefan> esec2[m] are you here for helping or troiiling?
02:48:08 <joltman[m]> Ugh! I just got my second 3XL that I'm sending back because the sellers keep swearing up and down that it's bootloader unlocked and they aren't, so I'm done with refurbs and just want to get a new phone from Google that I know is unlocked and has a warranty. That being said, how close is GOS development on the 4a (regular, not 5G)? Is it anywhere close to being stable or supported?
02:51:16 <louipcm> joltman:  theres some test builds. talk to anupritaisno1
03:02:51 <lev[m]> <joltman[m] "Ugh! I just got my second 3XL th"> Yeah I went through similar suffering to find a 3xl, the trick was to ask for the first few digits of the IMEI.  At least one range of the Google ones start with 99 (and I believe the Verizon ones started with 35?)
03:03:24 <lev[m]> that's probably not definitive though
03:04:01 <joltman[m]> Didn't help for me. Even got a fake screen shot of the "OEM Unlocking" feature not grayed out.
03:04:14 <lev[m]> I just got a new 4xl on prime day (they were clearing stock), and unfortunately I sold my 3xl already otherwise I'd offer
03:04:50 <lev[m]> finding a sealed new Google phone was a challenge lol
03:04:57 <joltman[m]> How much was the 4XL? My only problem with 4XL is no fingerprint reader.
03:05:45 <lev[m]> it's way faster than the 3xl, and the face scanner tech is more secure from what folks have said here, though I don't know the specifics
03:06:10 <lev[m]> it was like 450? but they accepted a trade in too, so I got another 140 off
03:06:37 <lev[m]> 64gb though, the 128gb ones were still full price
03:07:26 <joltman[m]> 4a has fingerprint reader and headphone jack, but doesn't have the water resistance and of course is slower cpu. Also, I really kinda need 128gb anyway. I have a lot of music local to stay more off grid.
03:07:55 <lev[m]> yeah, I do lament the lack of storage a bit
03:08:07 <lev[m]> but mostly my offline content is books, which are small
03:09:04 <lev[m]> you can also transcode your music to like 256kbps ogg or something if you want to conserve space, no need for huge files if you're going to use that onboard dac anyway
03:32:26 <joltman[m]> Well, it sounds like 4a is next in line for support, so I'm going with it and hoping for the best.
03:39:33 <entry1[m]> <joltman[m] "Ugh! I just got my second 3XL th"> Just look up the IMEI on Google Pixel Repair screen and if it says unlocked, you are all set
03:47:19 <joltman[m]> That's fine after you receive it, but it's too late then and you have to go through return process. Most sellers won't provide IMEI in advance for obvious reasons and they may lie about it anyway.
03:58:20 <dmatrixs[m]> <strcat[m] "and talking about cygwin (which "> I use cygwin for rsync like commands to  back up  my media drive preserving hard links  etc.. Is it bad an irrelevant even for a case like this?
04:02:38 <strcat[m]> yes
04:03:43 <strcat[m]> cygwin is broken and awful
04:03:43 <strcat[m]> makes no sense anymore either
04:04:10 <strcat[m]> you can either use proper native builds of programs or the official support for running Linux programs on Windows
04:04:28 <strcat[m]> so why use sketchy stuff that's super broken and has issues with large files etc.
04:05:26 <dmatrixs[m]> BC its the first way I found to clone multiple directories with hardlinks and I haven't made the full switch to Linux :(

06:26:22 <lpcvoid[m]1> That depends on contributors

07:51:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> <lpcvoid[m]1 "Aw alright, it indeed seemed too"> You copied a solution given by someone that nobody confirmed was working, didn't test it yourself and didn't contact the maintainer
07:51:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> We definitely need that commit in because we don't have oslo/soli in AOSP
07:51:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> But that doesn't fix anything
07:53:29 <lpcvoid[m]1> Yeah, in hindsight I should have tested it myself, but I kind of naively expected that to be done at build by testers, and since the guy said it would work I went with it. Probably best to revert that commit then, unfortunately
07:53:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
07:53:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "We definitely need that commit i"> .

07:53:59 <lpcvoid[m]1> ah, right, sorry

07:55:05 <lpcvoid[m]1> I was under the impression that the settings checked for this prop for the decission to show AOD as an option, but yeah probably pretty far from the truth
07:55:19 <lpcvoid[m]1> never grepped source myself to confirm
08:12:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> [lpcvoid](https://matrix.to/#/@lpcvoid:matrix.org) it's an overlay, not some prop
08:16:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> And this overlay isn't in the stock OS
08:17:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Stock uses oslo/soli
08:24:11 <dazinism> joltman: did you give the devices a network connection when you tried OEM unlock?
08:25:59 <lpcvoid[m]1> man that sounds like a harder fix then. But I have no clue about android architecture unfortunately
08:26:19 <lpcvoid[m]1> can you drop a few keywords that I can google to learn how to approach this?
08:27:08 <lpcvoid[m]1> i'd guess that it would boil down to implementing that overlay from scratch
08:27:25 <lpcvoid[m]1> and then hooking it up accordingly
08:58:22 <xv73j[m]> Hi I briefly glanced at some discussion yesterday about how graphene on android 11 seems to dispose of memory really quickly. I have experienced this where apps reload if I tab out from them or even if I just home and come back, and some things take a second to launch rather than being instant. Is this by design from hardened_malloc or is this a bug (to be investigated)?
09:01:56 <zyxt128[m]> There are complaints about android 11 in general, this seems not to be a GOS specific issue
09:01:56 <zyxt128[m]> https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/71720691
09:03:12 <zyxt128[m]> Someone on this thread has proposed a solution
09:29:57 <xv73j[m]> 👍that link has a solution, hopefully it works
09:57:01 <louipc> rule 1: always test your patches
10:59:07 <Arch2k[m]> <xv73j[m] "👍that link has a solution, hope"> This solution seems to have fixed the problem for me
11:07:21 <TheLynx> Does anyone know if GrapheneOS is affected by CVE-2020-12351/12352/24490 aka BleedingTooth or does the hardening of GrapheneOs again does the job? xD
11:36:32 <r0ckl0bst3r[m]> Anyone else unable to find location in the Waze app?
12:00:37 <redu321[m]> I see a lot of apps on graphene use "Sensors" right. I can turn it on or off. For what is that option. Lots of apps use it and i dont know if i can turn it off and still use tha app fine?
12:46:51 <ruddo[m]> Do we have support for Pixel 4a?
12:48:37 <alex-resist> https://grapheneos.org/faq#recommended-devices
12:51:37 <alex-resist> Alternatively: https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel
12:51:43 <alex-resist> It's not so difficult to find out :P
13:35:44 <joltman[m]> <dazinism "joltman: did you give the device"> Yes. The IMEIs on both began with "35" (Verizon) and not "99" (Google).
13:39:36 <dazinism> joltman: don't think identifying from the IMEI is that simple. Although think someone shared a link (following your statements) where you can enter the whole IMEI and confirm.
13:40:04 <dazinism> Think you may need to be logged in with a Google account to do so??
14:03:02 <joltman[m]> I checked on Google warranty site and it confirmed "US VZ"
14:08:56 <strcat[m]> redu321: Sensors is a permission added by GrapheneOS, which does not exist in Android
14:09:16 <strcat[m]> redu321: doesn't exist in iOS either, Android and iOS just allow it
14:09:25 <strcat[m]> so, since we're adding it, apps are not declaring whether they use it
14:09:33 <strcat[m]> and they do not have code to request it
14:09:39 <strcat[m]> so GrapheneOS has to add a toggle for every app
14:10:20 <strcat[m]> you can disable it as you see fit, those apps won't get data from sensors anymore (the ones not falling into existing categories covered by Android permissions like microphone, camera, body sensors, activity recognition)
14:19:13 <neo[m]> <strcat[m] "so GrapheneOS has to add a toggl"> Great feature, congrats!
14:55:53 <WoC> trying to find a release for the Pixel 4 XL, do have to build it from source or is there a prebuilt somewhere ?

15:09:18 <strcat[m]> dontdisturbme: all of them
15:09:19 <strcat[m]> as I said
15:09:28 <strcat[m]> read what I wrote above
15:10:25 <strcat[m]> Sensors (OTHER_SENSORS) is set as the default permission needed for all sensors (instead of nothing)
15:10:39 <strcat[m]> anything already handled by a separate permission still uses that
15:10:41 <strcat[m]> I explained above
15:13:36 <dontdisturbme[m]> U misunderstood me. Nvm. I go other places and read up
15:14:04 <strcat[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_native/commit/25e24fcf0b7478c0bd81764c7e3d8444cdc7e332
15:14:10 <strcat[m]> it's set as the default for all sensors not specific ones
15:14:18 <strcat[m]> anything that already sets a permission ends up overriding that
15:14:48 <strcat[m]> there are already permissions for body sensors and activity recognition - those override this, as they override the usual Android default of not requiring a permission
15:15:09 <strcat[m]> Microphone and Camera are handled elsewhere rather than as part of this
15:15:44 <strcat[m]> there is not a limit of which sensors are covered by this - there is a list of standard sensors, but devices can also have their own extensions (their own types of sensors)
15:16:02 <strcat[m]> you can see the list of standard ones in that file
15:16:19 <strcat[m]> that is not an exhaustive list, there is no limit on which sensors a device can add
15:19:19 <WoC> strcat[m], ty. After install how would you enable root ?
15:22:06 <dontdisturbme[m]> <strcat[m] "there is not a limit of which se"> Yup I was referring if there is an exhaustive list of such sensors which aren't covered explicitly like camera, microphone, body sensors.  I will have a look at said file.
15:23:30 <strcat[m]> there is no exhaustive list because devices can add whatever custom sensors they want
15:23:47 <strcat[m]> within the sensor framework, and those are covered by this 'other sensors' permission
15:30:08 <WoC> oh i see, no root access of any kind...
15:31:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <WoC "strcat, ty. After install how wo"> Wat
15:34:01 <WoC> i just realized, there is no root access nor can it be obtained
15:36:21 <WoC> or am I mistaken ?

15:38:27 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why would we do so much for security then bypass the same security?

15:59:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> [alex-resist](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_alex-resist:matrix.org) how am I supposed to know?
15:59:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> Basically 60 GHz frequencies are not allowed in India
16:00:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> And soli/oslo offers them
16:00:11 <alex-resist> Maybe they gave a reason for it
16:08:04 <joltman[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "And I won't be doing the 4a 5g, "> Same deal with the Pixel 5?
16:15:57 <applescruff_53[m> I know the whole idea of GrapheneOS is to degoogle this pixel phone.
16:15:57 <applescruff_53[m> Maybe my question is unnecessary, but I'll ask for input anyway. I just switched to Pulse for messaging services and I see Duo being offered for Video call service. I see this is a Goole sign in service. Will using this effectively make GrapheneOS pointless and or vulnerable?
16:18:09 <strcat[m]> that is not the 'whole idea' of GrapheneOS and you seem to be completely misunderstanding the purpose of the project and what it does
16:18:13 <strcat[m]> suggest reading more about it
16:18:20 <joltman[m]> short answer: no
16:19:45 <strcat[m]> we strongly recommend using end-to-end encrypted calls and texts via an application like Signal, Conversations, Element (Matrix) or others but it in no way defeats the purpose of the OS if you use something else
16:19:47 <strcat[m]> doesn't make much sense
16:24:52 <applescruff_53[m> I do understand GrapheneOs is a more secure and hardened OS than the Google OS. I have been having difficulties with Signal so I've been using the stock Messenger, but find trouble with that also. I'm merely wanting to be able to use these technologies without being part of some marketing scheme.
16:25:19 <strcat[m]> I don't know what 'troubles' you mean
16:25:26 <strcat[m]> you'll need to elaborate
16:25:58 <strcat[m]> we strongly recommend against using legacy carrier-based calls and texts other than when you have no other choice
16:26:10 <strcat[m]> they are insecure
16:26:21 <strcat[m]> and actively monitored with records kept on them
16:26:30 <applescruff_53[m> Thanks
16:27:02 <strcat[m]> Signal should work well and you'll avoid any mess caused by carriers for texts/calls by just using data
16:27:15 <strcat[m]> although legacy texts/calls should work fine they're just insecure
16:27:40 <strcat[m]> advanced features for those may not work due to carrier-specific issues, most carriers essentially expect you to use a carrier phone with a ton of bloatware to get full functionality
16:27:44 <strcat[m]> they deviate from standards
16:29:25 <applescruff_53[m> Why do some of the messages received on Signal appear in decrypted form, and how do I decrypt them ?
16:33:32 <applescruff_53[m> Encrypted form is what I meant
16:39:23 <strcat[m]> unsure what you mean
16:39:35 <strcat[m]> are you sure you're using the official Signal app?
17:35:37 <vvv66> Hello everyone, peraps this question is already asked but : Is GrapheneOS rdy for 4a ?
17:36:43 <joltman[m]> no
17:37:35 <vvv66> k thanks
17:48:04 <vvv66> Peraps a stupid question but : on  github, the milestone for 4a is 75% and it's seems like there is only one last issue : https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/milestone/3. do you think i can build one (i don't mind if i don't have this feature)
17:49:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> <vvv66 "Peraps a stupid question but : o"> There are more issues
17:49:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Example there is no auditor support
17:50:16 <vvv66> anupritaisno1[m] Mmmh ok mb
17:50:19 <vvv66> Thanks
17:54:14 <joltman[m]> Are there major usability issues in 4a currently or "just" privacy/security?
17:58:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> Don't know what you mean by that
17:59:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> If privacy and security which are core features of this ROM have issues
17:59:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Then that is a usability issue
18:02:09 <joltman[m]> I mean could you run GOS on 4a and have a workable phone knowing that you'd be giving up some privacy/security, considering that you'd probably be giving up just as much or more if you were running stock OS on the 4a?
18:02:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> No
18:02:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's not how any of this works
18:04:30 <joltman[m]> Would you be able to use the phone at all?
18:06:26 <vvv66> Is it possible to help on the dev of the GOS for the 4a ? (i'm a dev)
18:13:08 <dazinism> vvv66: think you could probably help out, even be the maintainer/part of the maintenance team going forward, if you were up for committing to helping with that it'd be ace
18:15:04 <vvv66> Yes, but i think that there it will take me a lot of time in order to understand the project deeply. Any resources to get into it ?
18:16:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> [vvv66](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_vvv66:matrix.org) you can pm me
18:19:08 <vvv111[m]> anupritaisno1: k
18:59:10 <alex-resist> I'm really impressed how patient some of you devs are. Same questions every day, sometimes every hour....
19:02:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> <alex-resist "I'm really impressed how patient"> Hmm

19:06:29 <alex-resist> What kind of work is needed to help with the 4a? What I could do: buy a 4a just for development purposes, set up a build environment if necessary, run extensive tests with provided or my own builds. Would that be a useful contribution or would I have to dive deeper into stuff?
19:07:23 <anupritaisno1[m]> [alex-resist](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_alex-resist:matrix.org) there's not much really
19:07:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need auditor support which is really urgent and the only release blocker right now
19:07:42 <alex-resist> So it's more the long-term commitment that is missing?
19:08:25 <anupritaisno1[m]> [alex-resist](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_alex-resist:matrix.org) it's easier to add auditor support if you have the device and are the maintainer
19:08:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just did a bringup of 4a
19:08:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't have a 4a and I am not the maintainer for now
19:09:23 <alex-resist> I will probably have a 4a for one or two days this week, that means I could do some simple things
19:10:02 <alex-resist> But not sure if that makes sense
19:10:26 <alex-resist> I do also have other GrapheneOS phones, so I could try auditing
19:13:47 <joltman[m]> When auditor support works, does that mean the next step is beta release?
19:14:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> If no other release blockers come up
19:27:43 <h3rb_> Hi guys

20:44:45 <M8942w[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "[8942w](https://matrix.to/#/@894"> are the trackers just based on what apps i get on aurora then? and does it also have opensource apps on it?
20:44:58 <M8942w[m]> sorry im a slow typer
20:45:16 <alex-resist> There are free/open source apps also in Google Play, for example Signal and Conversations
20:46:03 <alex-resist> However not all of them are gratis, which is quite confusing
20:48:20 <alex-resist> For example, I don't think you can download Conversations via Aurora Store, without an account, because it is not gratis in Google Play.
20:48:48 * Lynn[m]2 sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LOjrPDmDzoqRkkVmASMbSWMg/message.txt >
20:51:41 <Lynn[m]2> But I don't know if there's much of a difference in terms of security between Aurora Store and F-Droid. I haven't looked at the source code ... so ... 😛
20:52:51 <alex-resist> F-Droid works differently. The developers send their code to F-Droid, and they build and sign it. That way they can remove remaining trackers and unwanted components from otherwise clean apps, but it also makes them quite powerful. Many people prefer apps to be signed by the developers and just distributed by stores.
20:53:40 <alex-resist> As a result, if F-Droid gets compromised, it would be catastrophical
20:54:44 <Lynn[m]2> That's an architectural flaw with it, so is its use of v1 signing. However I believe they're finally working on getting support for v2 signing to work.
20:56:20 <M8942w[m]> so when useing the aurora store I just need to be carefull what apps I download from it and I will be fine right?
20:57:01 <Lynn[m]2> <alex-resist "As a result, if F-Droid gets com"> Especially since F-Droid doesn't even list whether or not the apps have reproducible builds, or anyway to cross-check it.
20:57:25 <alex-resist> GrapheneOS has decided to not make a choice, that's why it doesn't come with an app store yet.
20:58:05 <doobry[m]> In my eyes the concept to build software on a central (kinda trusted) infrastructure is more sustainable than having to trust random developers build environments.
20:58:06 <M8942w[m]> Lynn: oh and thank you for showing me  Exodus Privacy I will make note to make use of it again.
20:58:34 <doobry[m]> <doobry[m] "In my eyes the concept to build "> best is to combine this with reproducible builds, though.
20:59:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sup I heard there were cryptographers here

21:01:12 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Lynn[m]2 "weak encryption Actually I'm int"> I did it, hated it
21:01:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> The math behind Edwards curves is a brain aneurism
21:01:57 <Lynn[m]2> Well it is pretty hard. Sometimes I just get up and storm away from my computer in frustration.
21:02:09 <anupritaisno1[m]> Throw in some chacha20
21:02:28 <Lynn[m]2> Salsa and ChaCha are pretty easy, though.
21:02:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or build an aead
21:03:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com) so why doesn't chacha20 do Galois counter mode?
21:03:26 <Lynn[m]2> ChaCha20 is the encryption algorithm,
21:03:35 <Lynn[m]2> and typically it is paired with Poly1305.
21:03:48 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yeah you can skip that explanation
21:03:57 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why poly1305 instead of gcm
21:04:22 <Lynn[m]2> Wellllll
21:04:27 <Lynn[m]2> A hint could be that
21:04:47 <Lynn[m]2> Galois Counter Mode is hard and super frusterating to implement
21:04:54 <Lynn[m]2> At least that's what I've heard
21:04:56 <Lynn[m]2> I haven't implemented it myself
21:05:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> So why is there no AES_POLY1305?
21:06:16 <Lynn[m]2> 🤷 Because it's usually paired with GCM. For that reason I have no idea. I haven't checked NIST, but GCM may be a standard.
21:06:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sounds arbitrary
21:07:48 <Lynn[m]2> Pretty much. If you see ChaCha20 AEAD, it's almost always ChaCha20-Poly1305. And AES is AES-GCM.
21:08:19 <Lynn[m]2> A lot of people are not a fan of GCM for multiple reasons, though. The complexity is a big one, and so is the really small nonce size.
21:09:05 <Lynn[m]2> ChaCha20/Salsa20 by themselves also have a fairly small nonce size, but you can change that by using XChaCha20/XSalsa20.
21:09:44 <Lynn[m]2> 64-bit for regular Salsa/ChaCha, 192-bit for X variants.
21:10:25 <Lynn[m]2> 96-bit for AES in GCM, which is why NIST doesn't recommend encrypting more than 2^32 messages with random nonces.
21:12:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com) afaik nothing uses xchacha20
21:13:22 <anupritaisno1[m]> I've only seen shadowsocks do it
21:13:34 <Lynn[m]2> There are a few projects here and there that do. (Can't recall the projects, though.)
21:13:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> For something that is so rarely used
21:14:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Why is it better over something that's widely used and audited?
21:14:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> I'd assume regular chacha20 implementations are audited more?
21:14:44 <Lynn[m]2> Yeah.
21:14:47 <Lynn[m]2> BUT
21:15:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> So that krechkoff (definitely misspelt) law holds true?
21:15:31 <Lynn[m]2> Libsodium has support for XChaCha20. But it's not available via the `secretbox` api.https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretstream
21:15:38 <Lynn[m]2>  * Libsodium has support for XChaCha20. But it's not available via the `secretbox` api. https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretstream

21:17:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah
21:18:03 <Lynn[m]2> However implementing the X variant is extremely simple. Daniel designed his ciphers to be easy to implement, and constant-time.

21:19:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Isn't aes technically constant time now?
21:19:23 <Lynn[m]2> Just use Libsodium's default secretbox API. ChaCha20 has better diffusion, but Salsa20 isn't broken either. At least not with 20 rounds.
21:19:51 <Lynn[m]2> <anupritaisno1[m] "Isn't aes technically constant t"> Most of the time, yes. CPUs typically have built-in hardware instructions to do AES in constant time.
21:19:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like
21:20:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> AES-NI
21:20:52 <Lynn[m]2> anupritaisno1 Yes, that's what I'm referring to. Most CPUs will do AES in constant time.
21:21:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <Lynn[m]2 "Most of the time, yes. CPUs typi"> So what about SSE2/3?
21:21:53 <Lynn[m]2> I don't know. You can find out though, Intel lists whether or not they support AES-NI on their CPUs.
21:23:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> Kk

21:25:32 <ruddo[m]> <alex-resist "I'm really impressed how patient"> Chat is not the right medium for fielding questions, precisely because of this problem.  A forum is.
21:27:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> [Lynn](https://matrix.to/#/@lynn:spitetech.com) so
21:28:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> Do chacha20 hardware accelerators exist?
21:28:16 <M8942w[m]> hey I just downloaded the aurora store on my GrapheneOS phone from https://auroraoss.com/  and my phone warned me not to install because it is unknown. is this normal?
21:28:25 <dazinism> Lynn: can check the signatures once you download the apps, or check out the data fdroid uses to build an app to see if its reproducable.
21:29:16 <dazinism> 8942w: check out https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
21:30:04 <M8942w[m]> <ruddo[m] "Chat is not the right medium for"> is there a forum I can go to that would be better for my questions about GrapheneOS?
21:30:07 <ruddo[m]> <M8942w[m] "hey I just downloaded the aurora"> Yes.  It is normal.  You must check manually whether the signatures match on the downloaded app.
21:30:28 <ruddo[m]> For the record this problem goes away totally if you first download F-Droid (checking signatures), install it, then install Aurora Store from F-Droid.
21:30:38 <dazinism> Would be nice if there was an fdroid client that let you know if it was a reproducable build.
21:30:58 <dazinism> Also the target SDK of the app
21:34:02 <Lynn[m]2> <anupritaisno1[m] "Do chacha20 hardware accelerator"> I don't think so. But ChaCha/Salsa is already fast.
21:39:54 <Lynn[m]2> <dazinism "Would be nice if there was an fd"> Either that, or make an app that can obtain source code and build a decent UI for compilation.
21:40:50 <Lynn[m]2> That'd be sweet.
21:42:29 <dazinism> Imagine building chromium on a phone would be fun
21:43:44 <Lynn[m]2> Well ... Not all applications will be millions of lines of code with a horrendous list of dependencies.
21:44:11 <Lynn[m]2> But you'll definitely want a decent desktop for that. ;)
21:45:08 <Lynn[m]2> Completely unrelated, but I've been checking out the new mobile FF version.
21:45:08 <Lynn[m]2> I like that the URL bar is on the bottom.

22:10:16 <Lynn[m]2> Oh yeah

22:11:08 <dazinism> Apparently theres not much of that though?
22:11:29 <alex-resist> Firefox is going through a dark valley currently. But in the long run it will certainly improve

22:16:02 <alex-resist> Technicalities aside, it would be desirable to have at least one somewhat competent competitor for everything Chromium-based, otherwise we will soon have a toxic monoculture of browsers
22:16:16 <alex-resist> (unless you prefer Links2 or so)
22:16:50 <dazinism> Theres this pretty thorough comparison by madaiden
22:16:52 <dazinism> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html
22:17:21 <dazinism> I've also got a load of links to problems with FF
22:17:23 <alex-resist> dazinism ...which doesn't really appreciate the resources they're putting into Rust
22:17:31 <dazinism> Its all a bit depressing

22:18:38 <dazinism> The state of modern web/browsers
22:19:04 <dazinism> Think chromium is also fireproofing
22:19:32 <alex-resist> Yes sure, I just wanted to say that not all hope is lost with Firefox. Maybe we just have to wait a year or two
22:19:52 <dazinism> Google have more resources, bigger browser share, fund Firefox....
22:20:33 <dazinism> Thing is ff has been behind for years
22:20:58 <dazinism> Can't really see how they can ever catch up
22:21:23 <dazinism> More than likely chrome will keep moving ahead of any catch up
22:21:50 <dazinism> Especially as Microsoft now working on that codebase as well
22:22:22 <Lynn[m]2> 🤷 We'll see. It's mostly guesses at this point.
22:23:06 <alex-resist> Isn't there an anti-trust measure going on in the US that Google might have to sell Chrome?
22:23:23 <alex-resist> That might set them back (or not)
22:24:13 <dazinism> I like the idea of a not-for-profit developed browser. Even use FF for some things (well mainly tor browser) but don't see things changing any time soon (from chromium being ahead)
22:24:48 <dazinism> Ah yeah, did see a headline about antitrust cases being opened against Google. But didnt read them.
22:25:51 <alex-resist> Also we should differentiate between Chrome and Chromium. Chromium-derived browsers can be fine, whereas Chrome/Edge are privacy disasters
22:28:06 <dazinism> Yeah agree
22:28:36 <dazinism> Was being a bit lazy/inaccurate with terms
22:29:00 <alex-resist> I might have been too
22:29:22 <alex-resist> I would be interested in a thorough comparison of Bromite + Orbot, Bromite + RiseupVPN and Tor Browser
22:30:14 <dazinism> Guess it depends what you doing
22:30:26 <alex-resist> Yeah, i mean I've used all three
22:30:33 <dazinism> Think can only visit onions with tor browser
22:30:43 <alex-resist> Currently I'm back to Tor Browser, but for trivial reasons
22:31:21 <uchihaitachi[m]> Does someone knows if the project considers more phones to support alongside pixels?
22:31:48 <dazinism> Daniel says tor gives best privacy (browser blends in with all other tor browsers) but has worse security.
22:32:02 <dazinism> *tor browser
22:32:09 <Lynn[m]2> <uchihaitachi[m] "Does someone knows if the projec"> I doubt it. Pixels are one of the most open phones, and have a lot of security features.
22:32:21 <Lynn[m]2> A lot of other phones don't compare.
22:32:43 <alex-resist> dazinism yes, in theory sure. But what if Tor Browser stays on highest security level, i.e. no JS. Then Tor Browser's security disadvantages suddenly don't matter that much anymore
22:32:58 <uchihaitachi[m]> Lynn: Thanks!
22:33:01 <dazinism> The way I use it
22:33:12 <dazinism> Except for onions I trust
22:33:15 <alex-resist> It's also extremely relaxing & minimalist
22:34:05 <Lynn[m]2> Basically use Tor Browser if you want anonymity, Chromium for maximum security.
22:34:24 <dazinism> uchihaitachi: the first/ main problem is few other devices have support for verified boot with alternative operating system
22:34:33 <madaidan[m]> <uchihaitachi[m] "Does someone knows if the projec"> Other phones have been researched but one has yet to be found that lives up to the base security standards.
22:34:34 <dazinism> *systems
22:34:53 <alex-resist> Anonymity is likely more important in an activist context, whereas security is more important in a professional/corporate context
22:35:13 <alex-resist> (in the browser world)
22:35:14 <madaidan[m]> <alex-resist "dazinism yes, in theory sure. Bu"> They still matter. JS isn't the only attack surface. There's still HTML, CSS, images, videos, fonts, etc.
22:35:41 <alex-resist> madaidan Tor Browser on highest security level doesn't load many of those things
22:36:02 <alex-resist> html sure, but no remote fonts, videos are not playing etc
22:36:05 <Lynn[m]2> <alex-resist "dazinism yes, in theory sure. Bu"> Eh. There are a lot more issues than JS. There is also CSS, images, rendering, etc. Those can be abused too.
22:36:07 <dazinism> Then most (all?) other device manufacturers mess up device/hardware specific security
22:37:11 <madaidan[m]> <alex-resist "dazinism ...which doesn't really"> Rust is barely used in Firefox. It's not used for any main attack surfaces.
22:37:21 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/verified-boot
22:38:24 <alex-resist> madaidan but they're increasing the use of Rust. Currently it's not great, but it might be in 1-2 years
22:41:55 <Lynn[m]2> Might being a key word.
22:43:59 <alex-resist> Obviously :)
22:44:35 <madaidan[m]> With the Servo team now fired, Rust adoption is probably going to be massively stalled.
22:56:50 <martinonorcas> OK, not sure if this is the place to ask basic questions. I am here. I installed Graphene OS on my Pixel 4. I can call, message and web browse. But missing much of what made life good. Maybe there is a FAQ beyond the basic install FAQ. I need to pull in contacts from Google contacts or Apple contacts,  Can I safely install WhatsApp? Messenger? I
22:56:51 <martinonorcas> need maps etc. etc. I used Dashlane contactmanager. Can I do that ? What Apps are safe to install. What not? Is it safe to use an ID from Google or Facebook?  I need the bigger FAQ. The outlines and some details. Thanks Martin
22:58:52 <Lynn[m]2> martinonorcas GrapheneOS isolates apps, and has many other security features. If you *have* to use Messenger, and Facebook, etc you should consider using a separate Android profile and lock down those apps as much as possible.
23:00:28 <sphinxcat[m]> [martinonorcas](https://matrix.to/#/@freenode_martinonorcas:matrix.org): You can use Aurora Store to download apps from Play Store.
23:03:28 <dazinism> martinonorcas: check out https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps
23:07:23 <uchihaitachi[m]> martinonorcas:  I didn't see official recommendations for what apps to install on the project's website, unless the preinstalled apps and Bromite. I assume trusting which apps to use is totally up to you.
23:27:15 <joltman[m]> Pretty much
23:29:42 <joltman[m]> Not really the job of the GrapheneOS project to recommend or endorse 3rd party apps, but many individuals may have their opinions.  Depends on your requirements for functionality, security, and privacy.  Everyone's different.
23:33:09 <uchihaitachi[m]> "GrapheneOS is also working on designing and implementing a first party repository with higher robustness and security than the existing options. Rather than bundling apps, it could just offer recommendations as part of an initial setup wizard.
23:33:09 <uchihaitachi[m]> Users have unique needs and preferences and there has to be a very compelling reason to bundle additional apps with the OS".
23:34:31 <joltman[m]> That's really more of an explanation of why GrapheneOS doesn't bundle many apps.
