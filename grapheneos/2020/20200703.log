00:38:57 <strcat[m]> bonerdose: it would be more accurate to say filesystem-based encryption vs. block-based encryption
00:39:15 <strcat[m]> and filesystem-based encryption can have different keys for different files / directories
00:40:14 <strcat[m]> so for example it was per-profile encryption keys for user data
00:40:53 <strcat[m]> and it has support for device-encrypted data which for example the Updater app explicitly opts into using so that it can perform updates without being logged into a profile
00:50:45 <renlord> what about criticism re: fbe leaking metadata?
01:43:48 <TheJollyRoger> I think the metadata itself I think is padded to disguise its length, and then is itself encrypted. I think something to the effect that Hash-Encrypt-Hash addresses the issue of some of the directory names turning out the same the way.
01:44:05 <TheJollyRoger> Which I think might have been a problem with Counter.
01:44:11 <TheJollyRoger> But I'm not sure.
01:44:50 <overheadscallop[> isn't it also encrypted? https://source.android.com/security/encryption/metadata
01:45:36 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, AES-256-HEH on the newer handsets if I recall right.
03:12:10 <greenmoon[m]> https://twitter.com/topjohnwu/status/1278849731305672705?s=19
03:12:30 <greenmoon[m]> I saw some news
03:13:41 <greenmoon[m]> It is only for ROMs that include google apps anyway?
03:14:56 <strcat[m]> greenmoon: not relevant
03:15:50 <strcat[m]> hardware-based attestation works perfectly for alternate OSes
03:16:09 <strcat[m]> obviously the verified boot key fingerprint it reports does not match the one for the stock OS
03:16:16 <strcat[m]> why would you expect it to be any different?
03:16:28 <greenmoon[m]> Right
03:17:07 <strcat[m]> > This is pretty much death penalty for root and custom ROM users who still uses Google Play Services and expect things to work like it used to be.
03:17:13 <strcat[m]> and... 0 impact for GrapheneOS users
03:17:21 <strcat[m]> hardware-based attestation is a feature on GrapheneOS (Auditor)
03:17:39 <strcat[m]> we don't have Play Services, there's no SafetyNet attestation to fail
03:17:51 <strcat[m]> if apps have a hard dependency on Play Services they don't work
03:18:12 <strcat[m]> if people want apps to work the app devs need to care about them working without Play Services
03:18:54 <greenmoon[m]> I wonder if more and more apps require safetynet? All my apps work fine whiteout it. I hope they don't force it at some point.
03:19:01 <strcat[m]> baseline Android doesn't have Play Services
03:19:10 <strcat[m]> greenmoon: if the app doesn't have a hard dependency on Play Services
03:19:12 <strcat[m]> this isn't relevant
03:19:17 <strcat[m]> this is not at all relevant to GrapheneOS
03:21:11 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <greenmoon[m] "I wonder if more and more apps r"> In my personal experience only really shitty (subjective) games and banking apps verify with SafetyNet. Not even my bank requires it and I can use their app just fine on GrapheneOS. Sad to say but if you must bank on your phone, just use the webapp.
03:21:50 <cn3m[m]> Mario Go would like a word with you
03:21:51 <M0xC0ncord[m]> I mean I play Ingress, but I just repurposed my old phone to keep playing it.
03:22:32 <M0xC0ncord[m]> Ingress refuses to load even if CTS profile fails on SafetyNet, so I said screw it and just reverted my old OnePlus 3T to stock and relocked the bootloader to play it.
03:23:08 <cn3m[m]> Isn't Ingress Google's spy platform?
03:23:09 <M0xC0ncord[m]> <cn3m[m] "Isn't Ingress Google's spy platf"> Yes and no, by technicality. Niantic Labs *was* a subdivision of Google before they became their own startup in 2017(?).
03:24:04 <greenmoon[m]> Im more worried that they turn it on for all gplay apps and so they all become impossible to use without safetynet but I'm off topic I guess.
03:24:04 <strcat[m]> it's not relevant because SafetyNet is a Play Services API
03:24:20 <strcat[m]> greenmoon: doesn't make any sense
03:24:34 <greenmoon[m]> Good to know!
03:24:59 <strcat[m]> this is only relevant to people trying to bypass SafetyNet attestation and SafetyNet is a Play Services component
03:25:05 <strcat[m]> it is not relevant to GrapheneOS
03:25:19 <strcat[m]> and SafetyNet attestation should have been using hardware-based attestation when available years ago
03:25:26 <strcat[m]> it took them a really long time to get it deployed
03:25:34 <strcat[m]> it wasn't particularly useful before
03:25:40 <strcat[m]> still in the process of it being deployed
03:26:14 <strcat[m]> it is not a bad thing that they improved it to use the hardware support
03:26:44 <strcat[m]> people who were thinking they could keep trivially bypassing it are just uninformed and unimaginative, couldn't connect the dots that hardware-based attestation added in Android 7 would be used for SafetyNet attestation
03:26:49 <strcat[m]> not sure why that's such a surprise
03:27:15 <strcat[m]> we were talking about it years ago and adopted it to implement Auditor although with a pairing-based approach that offers a lot more security than using the root of trust
03:27:21 <cn3m[m]> interesting
03:27:22 <cn3m[m]> they don't want to get hit with anti-trust suits
03:28:00 <strcat[m]> it was hard for them to adopt it because they need full compatibility with all the screwed up hardware and devices that predated it
03:28:57 <strcat[m]> and all they're doing with it is verifying based on the root of trust
03:29:04 <strcat[m]> not very interesting from an actual security perspective
03:29:11 <strcat[m]> just for basic anti-fraud etc
03:29:40 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet is useful for anti-cheat / anti-fraud and DRM for media, etc.
03:29:52 <strcat[m]>  * SafetyNet attestation is useful for anti-cheat / anti-fraud and DRM for media, etc.
03:30:12 <strcat[m]> the lower-level hardware-based attestation API it uses has much broader uses since it can provide much stronger security properties
03:30:16 <strcat[m]> depending on how it's used
03:31:08 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet attestation is only the lowest common denominator of that + the userspace checks it does (which weren't really ever very useful and are even less useful now that it has a real attestation implementation to use)
03:31:43 <strcat[m]> if an app cares about working without Play Services and wants attestation they can get STRONGER attestation than what is provided via Play Services without using Play Services
03:31:57 <strcat[m]> and they can support any aftermarket OSes that they choose to support
03:32:05 <strcat[m]> so really, as I said before, this has no relevance to GrapheneOS
03:32:14 <strcat[m]> apps with a hard dependency on Play Services have never worked on GrapheneOS
03:32:17 <strcat[m]> there is no change
03:32:29 <strcat[m]> and if apps want attestation they do not have to use Play Services to get it
03:32:50 <strcat[m]> in fact they do better by using the lower-level API
03:53:44 <renlord> so why does google implement a safetynet api when its already exposed via android?
03:54:19 <renlord> is this one of those preferential design pattern that's deliberately meant to improve coupling of android and play services?
04:03:42 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet attestation predates support for hardware-based attestation
04:03:58 <renlord> ok ^ seals the deal for me
04:04:12 <strcat[m]> hardware-based attestation is guaranteed to be supported for devices launched with Android 8+
04:04:18 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet attestation is much older
04:04:28 <strcat[m]> and has only recently learned to use the hardware support to be a more meaningful feature
04:06:10 <strcat[m]> renlord: basically if apps care about working without Play Services they have a SUPERIOR AOSP API available
04:06:23 <strcat[m]> renlord: and the AOSP API fully supports alternate OSes
04:06:53 <strcat[m]> although apps would have to explicitly choose to support the yellow boot state with specific whitelisted verified boot keys (like ours)
04:07:34 <strcat[m]> renlord: I don't really see this as any kind of problem for us
04:07:52 <strcat[m]> real problems are things like U2F / FIDO2 support being implemented in Play Services instead of AOSP
04:08:00 <strcat[m]> and maybe we can get those things fixed
04:08:16 <strcat[m]> if apps WANT to use Google services with a hard dependency on them then not much we can do about that
04:08:42 <renlord> i think its mostly just a convenience factor for app developers
04:10:55 <strcat[m]> if devices without Play Services become more widely used
04:10:58 <strcat[m]> app developers will care more
04:15:00 <alicebobandeve[m> My company asked me to suggest a secure phone + OS and I recommended Pixel + Graphene after doing a bit of auditing. Thanks strcat for all your work.
04:17:33 <alicebobandeve[m> Needless to say, we are testing it out right now and they will make a donation when they decide to confirm the usage.
04:17:51 <chmod000[m]> hello
04:17:51 <chmod000[m]> thank you developers :)
04:33:48 <jknsec[m]> Woah. Neat. I love when Graphene is used for enterprise usage.
04:34:14 <defconanon010102> Hey I just want to give you an update. I fixed the display bug. All I had to do was close developer options after I was done tweaking a few settings in there. Just an update I wanted to put out there.
04:48:50 <alicebobandeve[m> jknsec: haha yes
04:49:16 <alicebobandeve[m> I have been using it since the C word days
04:50:00 <alicebobandeve[m> And obviously continued using Daniel's work later
04:50:22 <alicebobandeve[m> defconanon010102: what bug was this?
04:50:59 <alicebobandeve[m> If it's 3A or 4, never mind
04:55:21 <defconanon010102> alicebobandeve: I am running Graphene on 3a XL. So you are good.
04:56:00 <alicebobandeve[m> Ah
04:56:18 <alicebobandeve[m> I should switch but I don't like the 3A
04:57:35 <alicebobandeve[m> I'll buy the 5
04:57:59 <sheruleeya[m]> I'm waiting whatever the pixel released on May 2022
04:58:41 <sheruleeya[m]> Well, just a heads up that google store discontinued 3a(XL) recently, so their support ends on May 2022
04:59:08 <sheruleeya[m]> * I'm waiting whatever pixel is released on May 2022 (assuming the project is still alive by then)
05:00:40 <alicebobandeve[m> Nice. I'll wait for a used Pixel 5.
05:00:58 <sheruleeya[m]> * Well, just a heads up that google store discontinued 3a(XL) recently, so their support ends on May 2022 (since +18 months from now will end before May 2022)
05:03:58 <defconanon010102> sheruleeya: I already know and still preparing for that day. Most likely going to get the Pixel 5. Thanks for the info though.
05:04:43 <sheruleeya[m]> * Well, just a heads up that google store discontinued 3a(XL) recently, so their support ends on May 2022 (since +18 months from now will end before May 2022, and the support is either 3 years or +18 months after the last phone sold on the google store)
05:05:47 <sheruleeya[m]> If lucky enough, maybe 3 would have a longer support than 3a
05:07:59 <sheruleeya[m]> * If lucky enough, maybe 3 would have a longer support than 3a, if and only if the last 3 on google store will be sold later than Oct of this month
05:08:32 <sheruleeya[m]> "Pixel phones get security updates for at least 3 years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US.
05:08:32 <sheruleeya[m]> If the duration is longer, Pixel 3, Pixel 2, and Pixel (2016) phones get security updates for at least 18 months from when the Google Store last sold the device."
05:11:45 <sheruleeya[m]> * If lucky enough, maybe 3 would have a longer support than 3a, if and only if the last 3 on google store will be sold later than Oct of this year
05:25:14 <defconanon010102> sheruleeya: End of support life usually varies so who knows that would be great though.
06:06:22 <pacobell[m]> tap tap Is this thing on?
06:06:59 <pacobell[m]> Okay, read indicators. Nice.
06:07:22 <TheJollyRoger> Ahoy pacobell[m]. What can I do for you?
06:07:29 <alicebobandeve[m> Hate read indicators
06:07:59 <TheJollyRoger> You can switch them off if you like, after which your client won't honour them.
06:08:00 <pacobell[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "Hate read indicators"> Eh, it's relatively unobtrusive for me.
06:08:15 <anupritaisno1[m]> TheJollyRoger: you still up?
06:08:25 <pacobell[m]> I can understand the privacy aspect, tho.
06:08:31 <alicebobandeve[m> pacobell: I did, they still suck
06:08:48 <alicebobandeve[m> Shouldn't have been in, in the first place
06:09:07 <pacobell[m]> That's certainly an opinion.
06:09:27 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: yes, I'm still up.
06:09:34 <alicebobandeve[m> True, like paco instead of taco
06:12:26 <pacobell[m]> So I've read Micay doesn't believe that holding battery charge at 100% for prolonged periods of time negatively affects battery longevity. Is that opinion because he doesn't plan on supporting GOS longer than a couple years, anyway? Because Apple certainly believes that about their mobile products enough to bake advanced battery management into their OS.
06:13:11 <pacobell[m]> <pacobell[m] "So I've read Micay doesn't belie"> Supporting on a specific device, that is.
06:14:04 <pacobell[m]> https://www.apple.com/batteries/maximizing-performance/
06:15:10 <pacobell[m]> Namely this bit: "if you store it fully charged for an extended period of time, the battery may lose some capacity, leading to shorter battery life."
06:16:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pacobell[m] "So I've read Micay doesn't belie"> Actually I share similar opinions
06:16:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> The reason is simple
06:16:50 <pacobell[m]> I ask because before flashing GOS I was using a root script to automatically cut charging to the phone after about 80% and run directly from external power until unplugged.
06:16:58 <anupritaisno1[m]> Your battery really never charges to 100%
06:17:09 <pacobell[m]> Obviously, he doesn't believe in root on GOS.
06:17:14 <TheJollyRoger> pacobell[m]: If I recall right the device's firmware will automatically manage battery levels for optimal life.
06:17:26 <TheJollyRoger> Probably much better than manual intervention can; it's not 2003 anymore.
06:18:13 <pacobell[m]> Mine clearly doesn't on my Pixel 2 XL. I've empirically tested my battery capacity and it's less than 80% of nominal.
06:18:33 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well there's a so-called cut off voltage
06:18:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> When you reach 100% you're not actually reaching 100%
06:19:06 <pacobell[m]> Yes, but it's my opinion that the cutoff voltage is still too high.
06:19:10 <TheJollyRoger> As always your mileage can vary. High temperature and repeated deep discharging can damage the battery's ability to hold a charge.
06:19:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're reaching the cut off voltage
06:20:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> From there the battery manager does this thing called trickle charging
06:20:23 <pacobell[m]> I would gladly trade off less battery life for more battery longevity (assuming the underlying OS support is still there).
06:20:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Now how it is done is OEM defined
06:21:03 <pacobell[m]> Yeah, I know all that.
06:21:32 <pacobell[m]> That's why I forced charging to cut off at a predefined level of my choosing with root.
06:21:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> Typically it lowers voltage from charger, waits for voltage to drop to a threshold below the cut off and then charges again until the cut off is reached
06:21:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> It does so an OEM specified number of times and then disconnects the charger for good
06:22:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> But since it is tracking voltage by the time the charger is cut off you're nowhere close to 100%
06:22:34 <pacobell[m]> Oh? I didn't know about the backoff counter. That's interesting.
06:22:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> You're closer to 90%
06:23:06 <pacobell[m]> Meh, even 90% is too high for my liking.
06:23:07 * anupritaisno1[m] uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200703-115237_Settings.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/m.apex.to/yXvxnIOlEvXpaZvNQHurdvUp >
06:23:18 <anupritaisno1[m]> I just never disconnect
06:23:40 <cn3m[m]> people need to update the studies
06:23:58 <pacobell[m]> So, that device isn't your "daily driver", I'm assuming?
06:24:29 <pacobell[m]> <cn3m[m] "people need to update the studie"> I'm all ears if you've got better data.
06:24:46 <alicebobandeve[m> anupritaisno1: interesting, same time as my clock
06:25:06 <pacobell[m]> Even journals as current as this year seems back the historical longevity claims.
06:25:44 <alicebobandeve[m> Also, this is good info, wasn't aware about the battery manager's bit, thanks.
06:25:47 <pacobell[m]> Unless there was some breakthrough in lithium cell technology I'm not aware of that's been implemented in phones in the past couple years.
06:26:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pacobell[m] "So, that device isn't your "dail"> It is
06:26:44 <anupritaisno1[m]> The disconnect 11 hours ago was for a system update
06:26:48 <renlord> there's a reasonable assumption that by the time the battery life is expired, vendor support for your device expires too and you should be due to buy a new phone
06:27:23 <pacobell[m]> <renlord "there's a reasonable assumption "> I soundly reject that assumption. We need less e-waste, not more.
06:27:50 <pacobell[m]> I just wish it were easier to battery-swap my battery without running the AMOLED display.
06:27:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> <pacobell[m] "I soundly reject that assumption"> Just keep your battery always connected then
06:28:06 <pacobell[m]> So much strong adhesive in my model.
06:28:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> You can't have battery wear if it doesn't discharge
06:28:38 <renlord> pacobell[m]: if everyone had your mindset, then there'd have been zero incentive to develop anything beyond 2g
06:28:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW if you're curious
06:28:55 <JTL> renlord: Apples and oranges. 3G was actually usable. :)
06:28:59 <pacobell[m]> I thought dendritic growth still happens above a certain voltage level?
06:29:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> Oneplus does battery replacements for 6 year old phones if you're in the EU
06:30:01 <anupritaisno1[m]> Outside the EU they'll do it but the import costs are high and it might take months to get a battery but you'll get it
06:30:17 <pacobell[m]> <renlord "pacobell: if everyone had your m"> I'm happy to upgrade to newer radio tech, if it makes sense. Just like I don't believe jumping to 5G makes much sense right now.
06:30:34 <cn3m[m]> If only they did 6 years of security updates
06:30:39 <defconanon010102> This is very interesting about the battery but what if you can't always keep it connected and need to take it work? Is the inevitable just going to happen where you need to replace it? anupritaisno1

06:32:51 <cn3m[m]> T1 and OG SEP
06:32:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Every month they'll do select cherry-picks from AOSP and Qualcomm and that's it
06:32:57 <pacobell[m]> Then it's the SoC vendors' fault.

06:33:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> But riot is fine
06:33:40 <TheJollyRoger> anupritaisno1[m]: I get the riotx lagging too, if I type more than 5 lines into buffer. If that happens I have to force stop RiotX and restart it.
06:33:45 <pacobell[m]> Google really should be in charge of their own silicon. But then again, they've been historically horrible at long-term support, at least with software projects.

06:38:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yuki nagato, from the disappearance of haruhi suzumiya. Taken exactly at the end of the movie when she looks up to kyon's open threat to the data integration thought entity
06:38:57 <pacobell[m]> Perhaps.
06:39:05 <JTL> Hopefully someday we have our own "reference" hardware at some point
06:39:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "> <@sheruleeya:matrix.org> * Yea"> Or well due to it
06:39:33 <pacobell[m]> I'm really hoping for a RISC-V phone 😁
06:40:04 <pacobell[m]> Compete with the ARM hegemony.
06:40:10 <sheruleeya[m]> <anupritaisno1[m] "> <@sheruleeya:matrix.org> * Yea"> It's surprisingly relevant
06:40:37 <pacobell[m]> <sheruleeya[m] "It's surprisingly relevant "> 👍
06:44:40 <pacobell[m]> Oh, I do have another concern. When I was transitioning from stock Google to GOS, I was really hoping there would be an easy way to migrate my app data. I still have a nandroid backup in case I need to flash back to stock, but GOS has that Seedvault-based system. Is there an app or root framework available for Stock to make it compatible with GOS?
06:45:56 <pacobell[m]> I also backed up all apps with Titanium, but that relies on root to restore.
06:46:20 <cn3m[m]> pacobell: use adb backup
06:46:46 <pacobell[m]> You know that's going away soon, as per Google mandate?
06:48:39 <TheJollyRoger> It's not gone yet.
06:50:04 <pacobell[m]> I'd rather commit to a backup regime that's got longer-term legs.
06:50:28 <pacobell[m]> If Seedvault is it, let's do that.
06:50:43 <TheJollyRoger> Yes, GrapheneOS has Seedvault.
06:51:03 <pacobell[m]> But how do I do a Seedvault backup on Stock?
06:51:26 <pacobell[m]> I've got crypto seeds I need to maintain.
06:51:32 <defconanon010102> anupritaisno1: I am going to assume your RiotX is lagging pretty bad but it is fine.
06:51:34 <cn3m[m]> use adb to transition over
06:51:36 <cn3m[m]> use seedvault to move between Graphene/Calyx
06:52:28 <sheruleeya[m]> * It's surprisingly relevant, and thanks.
06:52:29 <pacobell[m]> So enjoy it while it lasts, huh?
06:53:09 <pacobell[m]> I was really hoping there would be a roadmap of some sort when adb officially sunsets that feature.
06:58:36 <alicebobandeve[m> <pacobell[m] "I've got crypto seeds I need to "> Syncthing
06:59:10 <pacobell[m]> Yeah, there's always that.
06:59:50 <pacobell[m]> Still, it's tied to the app storage, which GOS won't let me touch without Seedvault.
07:00:09 <alicebobandeve[m> PC?
07:00:43 <pacobell[m]> When I say "crypto", I don't mean "crypto currency" 😏
07:01:09 <alicebobandeve[m> pacobell: yes
07:01:30 <alicebobandeve[m> Did you read my username lol?
07:01:36 <alicebobandeve[m> Keep copies
07:01:46 <pacobell[m]> I'm glad you get it 😂
07:02:11 <pacobell[m]> The bugaboo is how to restore it to GOS using "proper channels".
07:02:41 <alicebobandeve[m> I don't think there's another way apart from the ones mentioned
07:02:42 <pacobell[m]> The whole "no root" thing is a huge usability hassle.
07:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> App-accessible Root is an antifeature. On Android, only init and a few other system processes required to get the kernel into memory should have root-equivalent access.
07:03:43 <pacobell[m]> Normally, Titanium would be a one and done. This adds a new wrinkle.
07:04:05 <TheJollyRoger> Otherwise, say hello to a single clickjacking exploit being able to take control of the entire phone, and goodbye to verified boot.
07:04:09 <pacobell[m]> Yes, I get free security argument. Doesn't lessen the backup pain point, tho.
07:04:26 <cn3m[m]> adb backup is fine
07:04:57 <pacobell[m]> Oh well, if this is the momentary state of the industry, I guess I had no choice.
07:05:05 <strcat[m]> if you restored it by hand you'd just end up with a screwed up state
07:05:13 <strcat[m]> are you going to manually set proper SELinux labels etc? no
07:05:22 <strcat[m]> you'll just leave an insecure / broken mess where stuff isn't migrated properly
07:05:29 <strcat[m]> so it's good you can't do it since you don't actually know how
07:06:00 <strcat[m]> I don't know it's even a good idea to do a full adb backup / adb restore
07:06:17 <strcat[m]> less of a problem with stock -> GrapheneOS than other cases since most things are pretty close
07:07:21 <strcat[m]> dunno why you're saying that adb backup is going away, I think you misunderstand what deprecated means
07:08:09 <pacobell[m]> Historically, that has meant software dropping the feature in a couple generations.
07:09:43 <pacobell[m]> That was hinted at last year. I give it another year before it officially breaks with Android 12.
07:10:01 <strcat[m]> seedvault covers the same data
07:10:24 <pacobell[m]> That's good. Now is there a way to get Seedvault to backup on Stock?
07:10:47 <strcat[m]> no and backups are not necessarily compatible across stock and GrapheneOS
07:10:54 <strcat[m]> they are different OSes
07:10:57 <strcat[m]> we don't have Play Services
07:11:02 <strcat[m]> apps do different things without Play
07:11:13 <strcat[m]> their data isn't necessarily compatible
07:11:15 <pacobell[m]> I'm okay with apps breaking due to GOS.
07:11:19 <strcat[m]> if you restore an app's data from where it had Play Services
07:11:28 <pacobell[m]> *GPS.
07:11:34 <strcat[m]> the data will already have state from using Play
07:11:48 <strcat[m]> pacobell: it would be from restoring incompatible data
07:12:13 <strcat[m]> the stock OS doesn't have seedvault so it can't restore seedvault backups
07:12:25 <pacobell[m]> I just uninstall those that have that dependency. Already had to do that for a few of them.
07:12:38 <strcat[m]> I'm not talking about apps with a dependency on Play Services
07:12:54 <strcat[m]>  * I'm not talking about apps with a hard dependency on Play Services
07:13:04 <strcat[m]> I'm talking about apps that use it when available and do things differently when it's not
07:13:37 <pacobell[m]> I see. That's a valid concern.
07:13:49 <pacobell[m]> I would just not use that app, then.
07:13:57 <strcat[m]> backups are fairly compatible between devices with the same OS because apps are supposed to disable backing up files
07:14:00 <strcat[m]> that are device-specific
07:15:00 <pacobell[m]> Yeah, some camera apps rely on certain Pixel hardware features.
07:16:01 <strcat[m]> you definitely couldn't just restore stuff based on raw files
07:16:08 <strcat[m]> we use different SELinux policy etc. than stock
07:16:13 <pacobell[m]> Although, Google hasn't really been using their PVC for much other than HDR+ lately. It could've been so much more.
07:16:39 <pacobell[m]> <strcat[m] "we use different SELinux policy "> Gotcha. That's definitely a showstopper.
07:16:39 <strcat[m]> we won't have that on custom hw anyway
07:17:58 <pacobell[m]> Eh, I've just resigned myself to installing stuff from F-Droid/Aurora that don't have the Play Services dependency. It's been difficult, tho. Waze barely works, for instance.
07:18:29 <pacobell[m]> I was surprised Google Maps even functions as well as it does.
07:19:32 <pacobell[m]> Oh yeah, I did the Bad Thing ™️ and ran microG. Spank me.
07:20:48 <dorrimi23[m]> <pacobell[m] "Eh, I've just resigned myself to"> There are a lot of apps that works on GOS, even with the play services dependency
07:21:14 <pacobell[m]> <dorrimi23[m] "There are a lot of apps that wor"> Yup, to varying degrees of "working".
07:21:51 <pacobell[m]> I was relieved that GBoard was among those. Gotta have my reliable glide typing 😁
07:23:18 <dorrimi23[m]> Yes, you dont really know until you try them
07:23:57 <pacobell[m]> Hmm, I'll have to check the Anova app to see it it'll still connect to my sous vide machine.
07:24:38 <pacobell[m]> I'm okay without the Wi-Fi functionally, but it's nice to be able to send recipe instructions wirelessly.
07:25:18 <pacobell[m]> Dunno if the device takes commands over he Internet. That's fraught with danger 😂
07:25:52 <pacobell[m]> At least it's got auto-shutoff when the water level gets too low (I hope).
07:26:31 <pacobell[m]> *pls let there not be an exploitable firmware vuln! 😣
07:27:24 <pacobell[m]> Cue obligatory @internetofshit
07:28:47 <pacobell[m]> Gotta say, Cloudflare has become much more tolerable on Tor after they made the switch to hCaptcha from reCaptcha.
07:29:15 <pacobell[m]> Dunno what that means for their earlier blinded token project, tho.
07:30:10 <dazinism> pacobell: was some recent discussion about using seedvault when its not signed with the platform keys https://github.com/stevesoltys/seedvault/issues/20
07:33:55 <pacobell[m]> Ah, someone asked "how does Google do it" and then they said it's possible to make Seedvault platform key agnostic.
07:34:14 <pacobell[m]> But I doubt GOS would approve of that.
07:34:44 <dazinism> pacobell: GrapheneOS has seedvault.
07:35:00 <pacobell[m]> Yes, but not platform key agnostic.
07:35:33 <pacobell[m]> It would upend the security model.
07:35:56 <dazinism> I was thinking about working out a way to slip seedvault onto stock
07:36:18 <dazinism> So you could get seedvault backups out
07:36:30 <pacobell[m]> That'd be greatly appreciated.
07:37:38 <dazinism> Would be nice if someone figured that out. Would make seedvault much more popular
07:37:47 <pacobell[m]> Oops. Look at the time. Gotta wake myself at the ass crack of dawn if I'm to beat the traffic this morning.
07:38:03 <dazinism> Night
07:38:21 <pacobell[m]> Cya all.

08:47:04 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it's kinda a bug fix

08:54:15 <strcat[m]> some of the stuff is set in init so need to think about which is really needed
08:54:27 <strcat[m]> the mmap entropy changes are useful because they impact init before it sets that up
08:54:56 <strcat[m]> but for example init already sets kptr_restrict to max value (it sets it to 2 then 3 then 4 to use max supported)

08:57:42 <anupritaisno1[m]> Sorry referred to an older source version
08:59:54 <dazinism> Just saw this claim that Samsung Note9 supports verified boot with alternative OS https://nitter.net/gaabrielvelloso/status/1278854047299182592
09:00:22 <JTL> no Knox bit shenanigans?
09:00:34 <JTL> > I've relocked bootloader on my Note9 and cts goes ok... Knox is tripped but OEM unlock unticked...
09:00:45 <JTL> if true that's :|
09:01:21 <dazinism> cn3m looked thru a big part of that XDA thread but didnt find anything,  did you?
09:01:25 <strcat[m]> they're saying they relocked with the stock OS
09:01:35 <strcat[m]> and by "CTS" they mean SafetyNet passes
09:01:37 <dazinism> Ah
09:01:44 <strcat[m]> it's one hint people have no fucking clue what they're talking about
09:01:45 <strcat[m]> so
09:01:53 <JTL> yeah I was skeptical too
09:01:58 <JTL> Rightly so
09:02:04 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "cn3m looked thru a big part of t"> oh that s10e?
09:02:20 <cn3m[m]> I found 2 references, but they weren't clear
09:02:32 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet matches devices to the profile for when they were approved (their Compatibility Test Suite certification)
09:03:00 <strcat[m]> so SafetyNet will say it matches a CTS profile
09:03:03 <strcat[m]> if it passes
09:03:15 <strcat[m]> so people have totally misinterpreted this and think SafetyNet runs the Compatibility Test Suite
09:03:24 <cn3m[m]> I have a feeling Samsung phones generally support custom keys, but it is a hunch
09:03:24 <strcat[m]> as TheJollyRoger will tell you
09:03:27 <strcat[m]> it's actually
09:03:28 <dazinism> cn3m: I'd be interested to see
09:03:30 <strcat[m]> pretty funny they think so
09:03:57 <strcat[m]> TheJollyRoger: can you imagine if SafetyNet attestation ran the CTS to see if it passes? lol
09:03:59 <strcat[m]> anyways
09:04:04 <strcat[m]> it's xdaspeak
09:04:17 <strcat[m]> so you have to translate it
09:04:36 <cn3m[m]> <dazinism "cn3m: I'd be interested to see"> I will check again
09:04:41 <strcat[m]> as far as I can tell all they're saying is they unlocked, then locked again (with the unmodified stock OS still) and SafetyNet passes - as expected, that's what it's supposed to do
09:04:41 <JTL> "xdaspeak" love that term
09:04:55 <strcat[m]> the knox tamper bit is an unrelated thing
09:05:18 <strcat[m]> knox tamper bit is burned when the device is ever unlocked, etc.
09:05:24 <strcat[m]> it doesn't really make a lot of sense
09:05:30 <strcat[m]> samsung doing samsung things
09:05:34 <JTL> ^^
09:08:43 <strcat[m]> https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation
09:08:46 <strcat[m]> the docs are pretty clear
09:09:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "TheJollyRoger: can you imagine i"> Not possible tbh
09:09:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "it's xdaspeak"> OwO what's this
09:10:07 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: I'm saying that because it's laughable to think that it runs the CTS
09:10:16 <dazinism> Given the time it took Jolly to run CTS on the Pixel4 and all the noise and stuff, the idea of safetynet running CTS is a bit of a jump
09:10:20 <strcat[m]> because of the terminology of it matching a device to a CTS profile being misunderstood
09:10:40 <alicebobandeve[m> safety net and CTS have completely different objectives don't they?
09:10:47 <cyredanthem[m]1> Is there an easier way to enable lockdown mode?

09:11:13 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet is a blanket term for assorted Google Play Services security-related stuff
09:11:17 <cyredanthem[m]1> Turn lockdown mode on
09:11:23 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet attestation is the Google Play Services attestation API
09:11:28 <strcat[m]> it's documented at https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/attestation

09:14:05 <strcat[m]> via the AOSP hardware-based attestation system
09:14:21 <strcat[m]> SafetyNet was originally just software-based attestation - largely just security theater
09:14:27 <strcat[m]>  * SafetyNet attestation was originally just software-based attestation - largely just security theater
09:14:47 <strcat[m]> it now uses hardware-based attestation on many but not all devices, but in a weak way
09:16:43 <strcat[m]> imo SafetyNet attestation is essentially obsolete and app developers should just use the AOSP hardware-based attestation API
09:16:54 <dazinism> <cn3m[m] "I have a feeling Samsung phones "> Would be nice if that were true
09:17:44 <dazinism> Considering how popular Samsung devices are
09:18:13 <dazinism> Also would open up a different SoC manufacturer
09:18:47 <strcat[m]> their devices tend to have bare minimum AOSP support
09:19:08 <renlord> they try to roll their own warez
09:19:20 <renlord> samsung everything
09:20:47 <dazinism> I know they arent great, but I'd hope that more devices supporting verified boot with alternative OS would make more folks care and snowball to more devices
09:21:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "their devices tend to have bare "> What about the essential phones
09:22:11 <anupritaisno1[m]> From a quick glance all you see is a proper AOSP device tree and an upstream kernel
09:22:32 <dazinism> They're dead though arent they?
09:22:32 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: they stopped making more
09:23:03 <strcat[m]> company is dead
09:23:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Ah they died

09:24:29 <alicebobandeve[m> <dazinism "alicebobandeve: its Riot Android"> Gotcha
09:24:33 <strcat[m]> people came forward about sexual assault and harassment by the main founder
09:24:45 <strcat[m]> which is probably part of why it died
09:24:55 <strcat[m]> because it was largely his company
09:25:01 <strcat[m]> doesn't exist without him
09:28:00 <anupritaisno1[m]> Makes sense

09:28:34 <anupritaisno1[m]> Yes alicebobandeve
09:29:00 <alicebobandeve[m> Worth the upgrade? I have to charge my Pixel 3 4 times a day now.
09:29:56 <alicebobandeve[m> Can't really blame riotx, this phone has been through a lot since more than a year now.
09:30:32 <dazinism> Pixel 4 is notorious for low battery life, no?
09:31:06 <alicebobandeve[m> Pixel 4 too? Fuck, let me do my research never mind
09:31:08 <dazinism> alicebobandeve: can see whats eating the battery
09:31:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well it's a good phone
09:31:54 <strcat[m]> hopefully Pixel 4a uses the same kernel from the start
09:31:54 <dazinism> Can get RiotX or Riot Android to behave better. But notifications are delayed
09:32:04 <alicebobandeve[m>  dazinism: I've done all that lol
09:32:16 <alicebobandeve[m> Too many cycles
09:33:35 <alicebobandeve[m> strcat: I hope the 4a is easy for GOS dev, I hate my iPhone 11, have to keep coming back to my Pixel 3 running GOS.
09:34:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't have a battery issue
09:34:14 <alicebobandeve[m> You use a Pixel 3?

09:37:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Need to match the specification on the charger
09:37:11 <defconanon010102> Makes sense.
09:37:20 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: it can fast charge from a computer if it has a proper USB-C port
09:37:24 <MysteriousWizard> Leaving it plugged in destroys the battery, I actually get mine down to like 5/10% every night, then take it back to 100%
09:37:29 <strcat[m]> it's not quite as fast as the wall charger
09:37:32 <strcat[m]> but it's faster than the slow charge
09:37:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): sadly I don't
09:37:49 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: also a standard USB quick charge charger
09:37:50 <strcat[m]> works
09:37:54 <strcat[m]> just not quite as fast I think
09:37:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> I spent a lot on CPU and ram but otherwise use a really cheap motherboard

09:39:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> Found the cheapest motherboard on the market
09:39:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> My total expenditure is like 500 CAD with this strcat (@strcat:matrix.org)
09:39:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> And decent enough to build
09:40:04 <strcat[m]> I think the SSD alone was like 1300 CAD
09:40:23 <strcat[m]> 2TB PCIe NVMe SSD, really high end one at the time
09:40:33 <strcat[m]> that's probably only ~3 years old
09:40:36 <anupritaisno1[m]> The i5 9x00f CPUs are a good deal
09:40:38 <anupritaisno1[m]> Wow

09:41:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Man just HDD here

09:41:11 <MysteriousWizard> <anupritaisno1[m] "Man just HDD here"> LOL
09:41:20 <strcat[m]> and that means I can't use EVGA motherboard which sucks

09:42:16 <alicebobandeve[m> My 3900X should last me a while but I need a new monitor setup
09:42:17 <strcat[m]> dunno if I want to just move this stuff over to a new computer
09:42:22 <strcat[m]> probably just reuse the SSD
09:42:38 <strcat[m]> just get a new motherboard + CPU and reuse PSU, SSD
09:42:54 <strcat[m]> reuse RAM too perhaps
09:43:04 <anupritaisno1[m]> <MysteriousWizard "F your speeds"> Just initial Soong takes a while
09:43:14 <strcat[m]> I think it's still DDR4
09:43:22 <strcat[m]> so I just need a motherboard + CPU
09:43:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "just get a new motherboard + CPU"> Ah so similar to what I did
09:43:29 <strcat[m]> maybe I can reuse my heatsink even

09:43:40 <strcat[m]> for new cpu sockets
09:43:40 <MysteriousWizard> <anupritaisno1[m] "Just initial Soong takes a while"> TBH there's not much difference when you load up a game, but damn those boot times
09:43:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> My last workstation was like 10, maybe 12 years old
09:43:53 <MysteriousWizard> <strcat[m] "noctua sends free heatsink mount"> Damn that's cool
09:44:05 <MysteriousWizard> Damn...
09:44:07 <strcat[m]> I think I just need to show noctua the newegg / amazon receipt for it and the new motherboard
09:44:12 <strcat[m]> and they'll send a mount
09:44:20 <alicebobandeve[m> You use a build server?
09:44:20 <strcat[m]> if one is needed - I somewhat doubt the old one will work
09:44:33 <strcat[m]> although I'm unsure if my heatsink will work with a threadripper layout motherboard
09:44:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "although I'm unsure if my heatsi"> Why threadripper?
09:45:13 <anupritaisno1[m]> Won't too many threads expose races in AOSP?
09:45:54 <strcat[m]> ahhh no I can't use my heatsink
09:45:59 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: no it won't expose races
09:46:07 <strcat[m]> I need a new heatsink
09:46:16 <strcat[m]> NH-D15 base is not big enough apparently
09:46:40 <strcat[m]> there's no updated D15 yet :(
09:46:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> <strcat[m] "anupritaisno1: no it won't expos"> Pretty sure there are a few
09:46:56 <strcat[m]> no
09:47:00 <strcat[m]> it will work fine with more cores
09:47:16 <cdesai> threadripper works great here
09:47:19 <cdesai> super fast builds
09:47:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> What's your current setup like?
09:47:47 <anupritaisno1[m]> Alright
09:47:47 <cdesai> LTO is still slow, but that's it - everything else is fast.
09:48:02 <strcat[m]> https://noctua.at/en/nh-u14s-tr4-sp3 yeah that's sad they don't have a D15 version for the socket yet
09:48:05 <strcat[m]> because the die is so big
09:48:10 <strcat[m]> the existing D15 won't work
09:48:47 <cdesai> could always stick that on the gpu xD
09:49:19 <strcat[m]> https://noctua.at/en/products/cpu-cooler-retail/nh-d15 is what I have for my current workstation
09:49:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just curious what kind of setups you guys use
09:49:29 <cdesai> me too, on a 3900x
09:49:48 <cdesai> x370 board though since I updated from 1700, gotta love AMD cpu compatibility
09:49:49 <strcat[m]> their newer generation ones have the new generation fans and more heatpipes
09:50:17 <strcat[m]> cdesai: yeah that's AM4
09:50:52 <strcat[m]> cdesai: the high end new CPUs are sTRX4
09:50:56 <strcat[m]> it's a much bigger die
09:51:02 <strcat[m]> so NH-D15 base isn't big enough
09:51:05 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I know, we have a 3970x in the office
09:51:10 <cdesai> on an AIO though
09:51:22 <alicebobandeve[m> Ryzen 9 3900X, Crosshair 8
09:51:49 <strcat[m]> NH-D15 beats most AIOs for prolonged load
09:52:16 <strcat[m]> they just look good in crappy tests because it takes a while for the water to heat up
09:52:43 <strcat[m]> but I guess I might have to do that
09:52:43 <cdesai> there are some good AIOs though
09:53:10 <cdesai> 280mm or even 360mm
09:53:25 <alicebobandeve[m> I got the 3900x from my firm though. What's your setup anupritaisno1
09:53:51 <strcat[m]> cdesai: I need to choose a motherboard too
09:54:01 <strcat[m]> maybe I'll just get some enormous AIO and case
09:54:01 <strcat[m]> lol.
09:54:13 <cdesai> strcat[m]: I might have something for you re AIO, give me a bit
09:54:20 <anupritaisno1[m]> <alicebobandeve[m "I got the 3900x from my firm tho"> i5 9400f
09:54:40 * alicebobandeve[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/MLvJzbwoWBAkMqOrKdMHnlZV >
09:54:42 <strcat[m]> 3990X is pretty expensive
09:54:55 <cdesai> strcat[m]: https://www.aquatuning.us/water-cooling/radiators/radiators-active/25905/alphacool-nexxxos-xt45-full-copper-1260mm-supernova-radiator?c=6566 here you go
09:55:02 <alicebobandeve[m> strcat: very
09:55:05 <cdesai> 3970X is the sweet spot
09:55:23 <strcat[m]> 3990X is double the cores though
09:55:55 <strcat[m]> and also with proper power / cooling you can probably get a huge overclock
09:56:17 <strcat[m]> since it's downclocked so much from the overall package heat / power
09:56:32 <anupritaisno1[m]> Tbh wish I could max out the ram
09:56:45 <anupritaisno1[m]> Like 64 gb
09:56:48 <strcat[m]> double the cores but still 280W
10:01:50 <anupritaisno1[m]> strcat (@strcat:matrix.org): what are your build times like?
10:02:06 <anupritaisno1[m]> Assume clean
10:02:25 <strcat[m]> a bit under an hour
10:02:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> That's pretty nice
10:02:52 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/94456/intel-core-i7-6950x-processor-extreme-edition-25m-cache-up-to-3-50-ghz.html
10:03:06 <strcat[m]> I have one of these @ 4.5GHz
10:03:16 <strcat[m]> was really good back in 2016
10:05:03 <strcat[m]> I have 2 computers that I actually use
10:05:23 <strcat[m]> workstation and then a desktop
10:05:32 <strcat[m]> 2x 27" 4k monitors, separate one for each
10:05:55 <strcat[m]> and a little USB switch thing for my keyboard + mouse which switches it back and forth
10:06:14 <cdesai> could put them in one case if you haven't already with something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB-zBSExMS4
10:06:17 <strcat[m]> so the workstation is separate from everything else
10:06:34 <strcat[m]> cdesai: prefer it separate
10:06:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Interesting
10:07:15 <strcat[m]> either both computers need an upgrade
10:07:26 <strcat[m]> or I need to retire the desktop and make a new workstation
10:07:37 <strcat[m]> and then this workstation becomes my new desktop
10:07:39 <strcat[m]> that probably makes sense
10:07:48 <strcat[m]> in which case I need to just do a build from scratch
10:08:06 <strcat[m]> this CPU is more than good enough for anything I'd do on the desktop
10:08:26 <cdesai> my other machine is still on a 2600k
10:10:03 <strcat[m]> I think I'll just do a new workstation from scratch
10:10:16 <anupritaisno1[m]> I don't even know what I'm doing tbh
10:10:24 <anupritaisno1[m]> Builds take 4h here
10:10:53 <strcat[m]> well I have a 10 core / 20 thread CPU @ 4.5GHz base clock
10:10:57 <cdesai> anupritaisno1[m]: what do you have?
10:10:59 <strcat[m]> which is not bad
10:11:13 <strcat[m]> and 64GB DDR4 (quad channel)
10:11:20 <strcat[m]> quad channel is really important for this use
10:11:21 <anupritaisno1[m]> That explains it
10:11:26 <strcat[m]> I'll do 128GB+ next time
10:11:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> So strcat you suggest I do more cores next time?
10:11:37 <strcat[m]> also the 2TB PCIe x4 NVMe SSD
10:11:52 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yeah
10:12:03 <anupritaisno1[m]> Will see
10:12:19 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: for clean builds 2x as many cores is almost half the build time (especially since we build kernel separately so 'clean build' doesn't include kernel build)
10:12:42 <strcat[m]> for incremental builds it's much more bottlenecked by single thread performance
10:12:51 <strcat[m]> also memory bandwidth matters a lot
10:12:55 <strcat[m]> quad channel is really important
10:13:11 <strcat[m]> storage performance doesn't matter that much but it helps keep CPUs saturated without needing a ton of extra build jobs
10:14:02 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well 4h isn't that bad
10:14:17 <anupritaisno1[m]> Previous one needed 2 days for a build
10:14:59 <strcat[m]> so yeah plan is workstation becomes regular use desktop and gets replaced with a new workstation
10:15:02 <strcat[m]> sounds good to me
10:15:29 <anupritaisno1[m]> It was a core2 q8300 btw
10:15:37 <anupritaisno1[m]> Didn't bother upgrading

Most of the recent posts had strcat and madaidan. trying to explain to absolute numb nuts how Android and iOS work, only to be met half way in the discussion with a comment "I'm by no means an expert, researcher or programmer but I did my research for 2 weeks"
15:53:02 <alicebobandeve[m> lol. Hats off to you guys.
16:03:41 <bonerdose[m]> Yo, what do you guys think is safer, TAILS, or Whonix on QubesOS?
16:04:59 <DannyWorkOrderP4> What's your threat model?
16:06:07 <anupritaisno1[m]> Whonix and tails
16:20:30 <bonerdose[m]> Government agencies, I live in a country where people are killed for criticizing it.  Tor usage is technically illegal here but bridges seem to work for people I know
16:21:59 <DannyWorkOrderPr> I'd be using Whonix/Tails, + VPN out of the country, if that's the case.
16:23:55 <anupritaisno1[m]> BTW exfat kernel coming for pixel 4
16:23:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> I won't be upstreaming the driver
16:24:26 <anupritaisno1[m]> So yeah don't expect exfat in grapheneos
16:27:54 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well unless strcat approves
16:28:39 <anupritaisno1[m]> Chances are pretty low BTW
16:57:33 <cyborgninjaneer[> bonerdose: if VPNs are legal there, use one based outside your country.
16:58:29 <cyborgninjaneer[> Otherwise Tor bridges are your only option, and still risky.
16:59:28 <cyborgninjaneer[> Technically there's Loki net as well, but it's still experimental and I wouldn't suggest betting your life on it.
17:05:12 <cyborgninjaneer[> If it were me, I'd use tails and have a way to quickly destroy the flash drive in case I got caught.
17:05:38 <cyborgninjaneer[> What you're doing is very risky.
17:06:24 <jfbourdeau1> DNS question  : my pixel 3a is not well configured and uses openvpn to connect to NordVPN server, I also change the config to force the phone to use cloudflare DNS. I tested my config with https://dnsleaktest.com  MY QUESTION : how do site as https://dnsleaktest.com are doing to know which DNS I am using ? it's not clear in my head how they get that info....
17:24:36 <cyborgninjaneer[> Best way to get rid of it would probably be flushing the flash drive down the toilet, possibly after damaging it with a hammer or butane lighter. You wouldn't want the thing on you or your property, and it would be best if it were destroyed before being discarded.
17:25:34 <cyborgninjaneer[> (That was also for bonerdose )
17:27:05 <cyborgninjaneer[> Ideally you want to avoid your home or cell internet as well in case Tor is detected by deep packet sniffing.
17:27:28 <anupritaisno1[m]> cyborgninjaneer: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/whatever
17:27:30 <cyborgninjaneer[> It's hard to say what the best practice would be.
17:27:30 <anupritaisno1[m]> Or GNU shred which uses 3 iterations
17:27:31 <anupritaisno1[m]> If you have a really good USB drive this might work
17:27:41 <anupritaisno1[m]> blkdiscard -s /dev/whatever
17:27:49 <alicebobandeve[m> I'd go with shred
17:27:59 <anupritaisno1[m]> This basically tells the drive to do a hardware secure erase
17:28:14 <cyborgninjaneer[> There you go.
17:28:52 <anupritaisno1[m]> Well idk how many drives have a controller that understands trim commands
17:29:19 <anupritaisno1[m]> You might need the non secure blkdiscard /dev/whatever
17:29:29 <alicebobandeve[m> Hmm
17:29:48 <cyborgninjaneer[> bonerdose: Just don't trust your tools too much. Assume that nothing guarantees safety.
17:29:53 <anupritaisno1[m]> The logic is simple
17:30:10 <anupritaisno1[m]> TRIM everything on the disk
17:44:39 <q22[m]> Any file manager recommendations?
17:48:45 <sixBit[m]> <q22[m] "Any file manager recommendations"> Why not using the default one from GOS?
17:50:44 <sivuda1[m]> <jfbourdeau1 "DNS question  : my pixel 3a is n"> Here
17:51:00 * sivuda1[m] uploaded an image: e590c2cd-9bc8-4ec0-989b-272663bf9dd9.jpg (202KB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/bwECUBzUwRDibVyEXajRVLmZ >
17:53:55 <q22[m]> sixBit: Sorry, I was looking for one that could handle network shares. Or am I missing something?
18:09:06 <sandelinos[m]> Android Samba Client (Access files shared through a SAMBA share) - https://f-droid.org/app/com.google.android.sambadocumentsprovider
18:09:09 <sandelinos[m]> This adds samba to the built in file manager
18:10:21 <sandelinos[m]> Nextcloud also integrates with the built in file manager
18:10:52 <sandelinos[m]> For FTP you'll probably need another app
18:39:42 <q22[m]> Cool, thanks guys
18:48:11 <DannyWorkOrderP4> Grapehene should be able to open VCF attachments, right? or nah
18:48:43 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderP4: yes. Import them into Contacts.
18:51:47 <DannyWorkOrderP4> TheJollyRoger: GrapeheneOS itself appears unable to handle the files I am receiving (may be one Google-Android sender's specific format, unsure)
18:52:02 <DannyWorkOrderP4> I get a white screen when trying to view from Messages (text), and when I download it and try to open it that way, same deal.
18:52:35 <TheJollyRoger> Hmm. Very strange!
18:53:45 <DannyWorkOrderP4>  * TheJollyRoger: GrapheneOS itself appears unable to handle the files I am receiving (may be one Google-Android sender's specific format, unsure)
18:53:55 <DannyWorkOrderP4> Thought so, too. So not a known issue. Okeydoke.
18:54:22 <DannyWorkOrderP4> Google or carrier probably fuckin with the filestandard
18:58:04 <DannyWorkOrderP4> "Import Contacts" from F-Droid handled importing the VCF properly, so it can't be corrupted/too non-standard.
18:58:27 <DannyWorkOrderP4> (^for posterity, if anyone's runs into this in future and is looking for a workaround)
18:59:42 <DannyWorkOrderP4> Will note that I wasn't able to choose where to store the contact on import, and don't seem to be able to change the Contact after the fact from On Device to Sync to an Account - but that's an "Import Contacts" complaint, obviously.
19:32:01 <DannyWorkOrderP4> TheJollyRoger: If you're still around - have you found any Android browsers that are FIDO2 enabled? Know you've done some work in this space, and went through Vanadium, Bromite, and even Chromium last night, to no avail trying to register on two or three different services, so assuming it's not the services.
19:32:04 <neonfuz2> Hey, maybe I'm just missing something but I can't find how to use the calendar on graphene
19:32:40 <neonfuz2> I can scroll around, but its just blank and I can't find how to make new events
19:33:08 <TheJollyRoger> DannyWorkOrderP4: sorry, no, I haven't.
19:34:17 <neonfuz2> Are external apps required to make calendar events?
19:34:55 <TheJollyRoger> neonfuz2: I think right now the calendar app's been disabled, but the Calendar API in Android does need to have it there for some reason, but I'm not quiiiite sure.
19:35:23 <neonfuz2> hmm, alright
19:35:26 <neonfuz2> odd
19:35:50 <neonfuz2> why removed instead of just degoogled?
19:36:01 <neonfuz2> there's a calendar on f-droid that's like the vanilla calendar
19:36:04 <neonfuz2> is it a security thing?
19:37:08 <TheJollyRoger> I actually don't know that myself, sorry. It's something from upstream AOSP. Upstream AOSP isn't "degoogled" - it just never had google in there to begin with.
19:37:42 <neonfuz2> yeah I know lol
19:37:44 <neonfuz2> and alright
19:38:35 <neonfuz2> https://f-droid.org/en/packages/ws.xsoh.etar/
19:38:41 <neonfuz2> I think this is a fork of the aosp calendar?
19:39:10 <TheJollyRoger> Not sure, but likely if it's on F-Droid I don't think it'll pass the project's standards to be included.
20:13:12 <neonfuz2> so I installed etar, and it's asking me to add a calendar account
20:13:28 <neonfuz2> I tried using the built in calendar app as the account or whatever, and it doesn't work
20:13:40 <neonfuz2> I think the built in calendar app is completely broken, even as a backend for other calendar apps
20:14:28 <neonfuz2> I guess maybe things would go wrong with NO calendar app when an app requests calendar permission, but the built in app is pretty much a stub
20:14:57 <neonfuz2> only really useful to give apps calendar permission that you don't trust I guess
20:16:26 <q22[m]> It worked for me as readonly with davx5
20:17:27 <neonfuz2> so you use davx5 and then use the default app as a viewer?
20:17:36 <DannyWorkOrderP4> <TheJollyRoger "Danny (WorkOrderPro): sorry, no,"> My mistake! I was misremembering our smartcard discussion/assuming you may have done some FIDO2.
20:17:56 <q22[m]> Used to, yes
20:18:04 <neonfuz2> when I select the default calendar and then try to make an event in etar, it just brings me back to the empty calendar in etar, and upon trying to make another event it says I need to add a calendar account and gets stuck in a loop
20:18:23 <neonfuz2> it seems I couldn't even write events to the default calendar with etar that is
20:18:59 <neonfuz2> anyways, etar has support for offline calendars built in anyways, I'll just use that I guess
20:21:00 <neonfuz2> oh wow, so I made a local calendar in etar and it showed up in the calendar app
20:21:18 <neonfuz2> I guess it just can't be a backend, you need another app to act as the backend ("calendar account")
20:21:59 <q22[m]> Probably
20:50:53 <hiya> Is Android swap always used with zRAM?
21:25:59 <demonMachina> Will have a 3a available in southern california if anyone is insterested. probably mid august
22:57:21 <animalchin[m]> Does anyone know what the System App "Presence" is? I was trying to learn more about the apps and couldn't find any info on it. Only thing I could find was the security camera app in the PlayStore and I'm pretty sure it isn't that. Thank you.
23:01:05 <strcat[m]> Nikos: etar was originally a fork of the AOSP calendar but it's a lot different now
23:01:21 <strcat[m]> and the AOSP calendar was stripped down into a sample app
23:04:41 <cdesai> strcat[m]: we're shipping it now, lineage got it building in aosp
23:06:22 <strcat[m]> I won't bundle GPLv3 code
23:06:50 <strcat[m]> rather just have it installed as an app by users
23:06:59 <ruddo[m]> <strcat[m] "I won't bundle GPLv3 code"> Why tho
23:07:23 <strcat[m]> because it's incompatible with making a GrapheneOS device with an immutable root of trust
23:07:28 <strcat[m]> which is incompatible with the goals of the project
23:07:56 <JTL> Would supporting a custom verified boot key similar to how Pixels currently do it still be incompatible?
23:08:02 <strcat[m]> and I want to work towards not having any restrictively licensed code eventually
23:08:04 <JTL> I agree it's kinda silly
23:08:52 <cdesai> What's sad is the original Calendar was Apache2, and they changed it for one contributor and then kept it.
23:09:00 <strcat[m]> JTL: what Pixels do is compatible, if we make our own device we don't necessarily have the resources to make a comparable implementation and hard-wiring it is a simpler way to make it secure
23:09:09 <JTL> Fair
23:09:10 <strcat[m]> Pixels have the Titan M paired with the TEE for this
23:09:18 <strcat[m]> and store the custom key in the Titan M
23:09:25 <strcat[m]> which also enforces bootloader lock state etc.
23:09:35 <strcat[m]> JTL: I want GrapheneOS to be usable on a device with an *immutable* root of trust
23:09:45 <JTL> I do agree it's some amount of complexity and takes extra resources
23:09:47 <strcat[m]> rather than just on devices like Pixels with a security chip for enforcing it based on protected state
23:09:52 <JTL> Fair
23:10:06 <strcat[m]> not every company / organization / individual that will want GrapheneOS will want it to be possible to boot another OS
23:10:20 <strcat[m]> so bundling GPLv3 code is not compatible with the project being permissively licensed
23:10:30 <strcat[m]> and having it usable for everything people should be able to use it for
23:10:51 <strcat[m]> GPLv2 isn't a problem but I would rather avoid code that can't be mixed and matched with other code
23:10:53 <JTL> I'm personally in the camp of "want verifeid boot with custom keys as an optional feature" but I agree with your reasons
23:10:58 <strcat[m]> because that's problematic and then I have to be careful about working on it
23:11:06 <TheJollyRoger-M> Makes sense.
23:11:43 <strcat[m]> for example if I make something in the kernel first and then want to use it in userspace
23:11:48 <strcat[m]> I have to be careful it's not tainted by the kernel GPLv2 code
23:11:53 <strcat[m]> so it's better to write it for userspace first
23:12:10 <strcat[m]> hardened_malloc as an example of something where code sharing would be useful
23:12:12 <strcat[m]> with a hardened slab allocator
23:12:53 <TheJollyRoger-M> Wow.
23:13:16 <FinnwwwBackFromt> Does Valladium support PWA installation?
23:23:20 <strcat[m]> yes
23:23:23 <strcat[m]> it's Vanadium
23:26:32 <FinnwwwBackFromt> Does it install actual Android packages or just shortcuts?
23:27:38 <cn3m[m]> shortcuts it's no different than how regular Android and Chrome do it
23:27:39 <DannyWorkOrderP4> It's just a stateful website "container" linked to an icon on your homescreen, mate
23:27:40 <DannyWorkOrderP4> No magic
