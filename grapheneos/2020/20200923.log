00:07:53 <signalarch[m]> Is there any danger to buying a used phone? Specifically a renewed pixel from amazon?
00:09:15 <alzxjm[m]> signalarch: Probably not. That's the nice thing about hardware-backed verified boot. If you flash stock OS or Calyx/Graphene and lock the bootloader with their keys you're guaranteed to be booting a known good system.
00:10:44 <alzxjm[m]> There was one really cool attack demonstrated by spoofing hardware: replacing the screen or some other hardware component which could allow an attacker to exploit your system somehow (I'm not sure of the details) and afaik only the iPhone 11 has mitigation for such an attack.
00:11:01 <alzxjm[m]> But I don't think that is a real world problem you have to worry about. Used Pixel is probably fine.

Similar thing with having a conversation in the same room as the Graphene Pixel 3 XL and the I go on the PC and see adverts related to the conversation contents?
08:45:34 <Lia[m]> It depends on how you separate your activities on your devices, what sites you visit, or your habits
08:46:00 <Lia[m]> Also, GrapheneOS will not prevent tracking because of your bad habits
08:46:19 <traffickpolize[m> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3 your camera isn't spying on
08:46:21 <Lia[m]> It can only mitigate to some extent the OS can do
08:46:40 <traffickpolize[m> You are noticing the ad since it's relevant by chance
08:47:07 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Don't install horrible apps with unessacary permissions and trackers
08:48:48 <Lckdyspl7[m]> I'd say they are not related in any form, possibly another device you have in your home connected to the WiFi network?? Smart TV for example

08:55:25 <Lia[m]> Did you know Netguard can be easily bypassed by download manager, which is blocked by the Network permission?

10:03:56 <dazinism> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3: On GrapheneOS you are probably better off using the network permission
10:06:10 <dazinism> Possibly with paid NetGuard and some apps you may be able to stop analytics or ads. But cases where that could be worth doing are limited and NetGuard isnt as robust at blocking as the Network permission
10:07:34 <dazinism> Case where it may make sense is say..... an xmpp client where you could block all connections except to your xmpp server.

10:13:40 <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3> This morning I'd somehow left Netguard disabled too.
10:27:17 <Autopsy[m]> You don't need to use Netguard.
10:27:37 <Autopsy[m]> hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3 the built in network permission toggle is good enough.
10:27:52 <dazinism> NetGuard can also be handy for looking at what network connections apps make.
10:27:53 <save2020[m]> Can someone recommend a good kVM VPS outside of the 14 eyes countries?
10:28:30 <dazinism> There is some built in AOSP network logs, but they arent exposed to users
10:28:55 <Autopsy[m]> <save2020[m] "Can someone recommend a good kVM"> https://www.serverhunter.com/
10:29:00 <Erraverunt> did grapheos have anything like this? https://fossunited.org/project?project=Privacy%20Indicator%20App
10:29:24 <save2020[m]> Autopsy: thanks
10:29:25 <Autopsy[m]> Filter until your heart is content.
10:29:27 <nvidia_corp[m]> Also you can set Netguard to default deny. So a malicious app if got installed will be required to be whitelisted first for it to work.
10:31:18 <dazinism> Trouble is its less robust. NetGuard can crash and stop blocking
10:31:37 <dazinism> Or other apps may start up on boot before it
10:32:37 <dazinism> Also apps can make network connections via other apps, which NetGuard doesn't block
10:33:19 <Autopsy[m]> <nvidia_corp[m] "Also you can set Netguard to def"> Perhaps a user should think twice before installing a malicious app. If it's that malicious, Netguard won't do anything to protect you. Use the Network Toggle.
10:33:32 <nvidia_corp[m]> Android Permission System/Model is not robust. GrapheneOS cannot fix the shithole. You should not use Android if you are serious about security. It's iOS or no phone at all.
10:33:32 <Autopsy[m]> Exactly what dazinism is saying.
10:33:32 <dazinism> As mentioned the GrapheneOS network permission does block some apps from providing network to others
10:34:36 <nvidia_corp[m]> It took 7 years for Google to be able to implement scoped storage. which is yet to be completely enforced as I can see.
10:35:29 <nvidia_corp[m]> iOS did it way back.
10:37:32 <dazinism> nvidia_corp: think the android permission model does what it says? Just the model wasn't/isn't as tight as on iOS. Its improved vastly in the last few years
10:39:29 <nvidia_corp[m]> <Autopsy[m] "Perhaps a user should think twic"> Problem with the network toggle is that it should be on auto deny mode.
10:40:25 <dazinism> Yeah, trouble is that would confuse to many people as app developers don't code their apps to ask for it if its needed
10:40:54 <nvidia_corp[m]> <dazinism "nvidia_corp: think the android p"> You can improve the shithole but really cannot fix it.
10:41:19 <dazinism> Guess if someone wrote a patch to have a toggle for default deny it may well be accepted?
10:42:22 <dazinism> Guess it depends on your definition of fixed. What changes you are looking for?
10:43:48 <dazinism> Heavy use of multiple users, (ideally with a better UI / UX for that) allows for better isolation between groups of apps
10:44:53 <dazinism> Theres a lot of potential to improve the experience of using multiple users
10:45:23 <dazinism> Some stuff maybe not so difficult to implement
10:45:32 <nvidia_corp[m]> <dazinism "Guess it depends on your definit"> I wish changes were enough to fix it. But unfortunately they are not. You have a bloated kernel from an ancient era. How can it be fixed? A browser like Chromium comes with code equivalent to an OS. Only a rewrite can save Android. No wonder Google is working on something like Fuschia or whatever it's called.
10:46:08 <nvidia_corp[m]> What you are suggesting is trivial changes. They may help but end of the day you are left with a not so robust os fucked up from the bottom.
10:46:36 <dazinism> The trouble with browsers is everywhere.... and is really a problem with the modern web
10:47:10 <dazinism> Needs a major rethink/re- architecture to solve
10:48:18 <dazinism> The kernel is the weakness in android. But its arguably still better than everything else than iOS
10:49:50 <dazinism> And the improvements in  GrapheneOS give it some advantages over iOS (yet also still some stuff not as good)
10:50:42 <dazinism> nvidia_corp: have you read Daniels comparison of iOS and GrapheneOS on Reddit?
10:52:17 <nvidia_corp[m]> <dazinism "nvidia_corp: have you read Danie"> I might have read it some time back when I was researching on GOS.
10:54:36 <dazinism> This one covers a lot
10:54:39 <dazinism> https://reddit.com/comments/gd3jx4/comment/fpfm6ls
10:54:48 <cn3m[m]> the biggest advantages with iOS are definitely the verified boot and kernel
10:54:53 <cn3m[m]> and MTE if you will wait
10:54:58 <dazinism> Of android vs. iOS
10:55:08 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS wins the rest(generally)
10:55:09 <dazinism> I'll get the other I was thinking of
10:55:21 <nvidia_corp[m]> iOS offers many decent apps out of the box. So the reliance on 3rd party apps can be reduced there. AOSP apps are pale in comparison.
10:55:26 <cn3m[m]> oh and iOS has better sandboxing as far as inter connection and background limits
10:55:45 <cn3m[m]> yeah that is true, Apple just wins at trust minimization in general thouugh
10:55:58 <cn3m[m]> you can use only their chips, devices, os, and services
10:56:06 <dazinism> https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/
10:56:10 <cn3m[m]> and get through your life(usually)
10:56:39 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS having it's own store would be a big win though
10:59:59 <Lia[m]> <hnfpz5w6jg9hfjk3 "I'm a Newbie. Have been followin"> No offense, but Brax is a joke

15:01:28 <save2020[m]> With Covid tracking BS and "Google vs Parsa" lawsuit this should become the decade of glory for GrapheneOS
15:02:19 <save2020[m]> I ll try to switch as many people as I can to GrapheneOS and QubesOS as a boicot for the spying corporations
15:11:04 <deetot> You need decent hardware for qubeos through
15:11:40 <deetot> I have to buy a new CPU for it
15:13:22 <save2020[m]> Yes my laptop is a Asus ROG i7, 32 Gb of RAM, and a 2 TB SSD, in my case... On older devices its hard
15:13:33 <save2020[m]> 8 Gb just to boot up
15:14:03 <save2020[m]> Just the OS partition is 250 Gb for the VMs
15:15:41 <deetot> Does your CPU have all the requirements
15:16:20 <deetot> Vt-d and vt-x
15:19:00 <save2020[m]> I did not even checked, it just worked
15:19:26 <deetot> What CPU u have?
15:19:56 <save2020[m]> I7 9th gen
15:20:12 <save2020[m]> Asus ROG G731GT
15:20:29 <deetot> Model number
15:20:46 <deetot> What CPU model number
15:21:04 <save2020[m]> 9750H
15:22:00 <jpds> Folks, there's an offtopic room for non-Graphene things
15:22:29 <deetot> Good for you
15:22:30 <save2020[m]> Leave a link for that room please
15:25:02 <jpds> #grapheneos-offtopic
15:28:51 <dazinism> crankycrawdad: think its better to use the Wireguard app running in userspace rather that exposing the kernel via having wireguard stuff running there.
15:29:15 <dazinism> Apparently wireguard app works well and has low power draw

15:35:05 <cryptoamnesia[m]> is there a workaround to the gallery crashing issue? not sure if anyone has reported that already
15:35:20 <cryptoamnesia[m]> in the newest update, when I try to crop and save a screenshot, gallery crashes.
15:35:47 <cryptoamnesia[m]> 3a XL
15:42:30 <Lia[m]> <cryptoamnesia[m] "in the newest update, when I try"> edit button is broken
15:42:36 <Lia[m]> And is already reported
15:42:44 <cryptoamnesia[m]> ok, cool. thanks
17:00:49 <ewegerg> Hello everyone, is there any code for any web application on IRC java script on the internet?
17:05:03 <louipc> ewegerg: this is a bad place to ask that question
17:06:07 <louipc> ewegerg: maybe try #freenode
17:07:01 <ewegerg> sorry( my teacher asked me to write a web chat application using the ICR protocol. But I don't know where to start. I read about the protocol itself
17:07:13 <ewegerg> IRC)
17:09:23 <louipc> theres a channel ##irc that would be more appropriate for you
17:39:46 <res4[m]> Isn't it crazy that some people are getting excited over HarmonyOS while GrapheneOS, you know, exists? The stigma against US corporations is (deservedly) huge at this point, but if those smartphone enthusiasts actually cared about surveillance, you'd think they would've come across Graphene by now.
17:41:08 <nothankyou[m]> Until proven, HarmonyOS is insecure and untrustworthy
17:41:20 <nothankyou[m]>  * Until proven otherwise,HarmonyOS is insecure and untrustworthy
17:41:33 <nothankyou[m]> Especially coming from Huawei
17:41:40 <res4[m]> Obviously.
17:42:31 <nothankyou[m]>  * Until proven otherwise, HarmonyOS is insecure and untrustworthy
17:43:19 <res4[m]> Somehow Huawei has a strangely good reputation with some people. Is there any chance the open source of HarmonyOS could be of any use to the development of Graphene at all? I'm guessing not, but it's a question I was wondering about.
17:44:02 <mastercakex[m]> <cryptoamnesia[m] "is there a workaround to the gal"> Google Photos
17:44:09 <nothankyou[m]> It depends if their kernel is secure, or has been tested by time and not riddled by bugs like Linux
17:44:35 <nothankyou[m]> Offtopic but I'd look more forward to FuchsiaOS and Zircon kernel for security
17:44:56 <louipc> res4[m]: u can start the graphene street team :D
17:45:30 <nothankyou[m]> <res4[m] "Somehow Huawei has a strangely g"> It was because Google Android Play services has horrible track record in privacy
17:45:57 <nothankyou[m]> Huawei don't have Play services
17:49:50 <res4[m]> <louipc "res4: u can start the graphene s"> Right. "Wake up sheeple"-style. I'm sure being a small community is cool and all, but I'd love to see wider adoption. At least privacy on the level of iOS should be the standard for popular OSs, not a luxury. Graphene is great, but won't solve the fundamental issue by itself. Still, wider awareness of the OS might at least start some interesting discussions in the mainstream.
17:50:34 <louipc> need tshirts and stickers and all that jazz
17:50:52 <nickcalyx[m]> > Huawei don't have Play services
17:50:52 <nickcalyx[m]> They do have some kind of services framework I think
17:51:36 <res4[m]> That's what I thought as well.
17:54:40 <nothankyou[m]> Well, from one spy to another lol
17:55:15 <res4[m]> <louipc "need tshirts and stickers and al"> Or package actual jazz with every install of GrapheneOS. Randomly generated with encryption keys stored in the Titan M chip, so no one but you will get to listen to your sweet, sweet personal privacy-jazz.
17:55:46 <louipc> hah
17:56:07 <nothankyou[m]> What makes people think Huawei is any better with their own service framework?
17:57:00 <res4[m]> I really think it just comes down to an anti-US mentality.
17:58:06 <dorrimi23[m]> <res4[m] "I really think it just comes dow"> Yep
17:59:17 <nothankyou[m]> <nothankyou[m] "What makes people think Huawei i"> Or their version of "gms"?
18:23:49 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> Hi. Can anyone help me troubleshoot my Auditor app? It had suddenly stopped sending remote verification. I tried to rotate the QR code and repair it but it's still not working.
18:23:49 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> I'm running GrapheneOS 09.11.14 on Pixel 4 XL with latest Auditor update.
18:23:53 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> I would really appreciate it!
18:25:05 <strcat[m]> d3nm6ugnffwftn2j43ni: the QR code on the account page is just for registering a device with an account, rotating it has nothing to do with verification
18:26:10 <strcat[m]> has no relevance after registering a device with an account
18:26:48 <strcat[m]> deleting a device and repairing it never makes sense unless you've done something like wiping it
18:27:08 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> <strcat[m] "deleting a device and repairing "> I see... So do you happen to know why it stopped sending verification for me?
18:27:13 <strcat[m]> what you should have done is a local verification to figure out why it's not passing verification
18:27:19 <strcat[m]> I doubt it stopped sending verifications
18:27:30 <strcat[m]>  * I doubt it stopped sending attestations
18:27:30 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> <strcat[m] "I doubt it stopped sending verif"> Got it. I'll try it right away
18:30:12 * d3nm6ugnffwftn2j uploaded an image: Screenshot_20200924-022951.png < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YNRUuDrwPEbVBFJInMIVFhKd/Screenshot_20200924-022951.png >
18:30:21 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> Oh no... This showed up
18:35:59 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> It seems like it has no problem verifying other devices but being verified...
18:42:51 <telum[m]> Are there any features in Graphene that could be blocking internet access to an individual app? I can't get AntennaPod downloading over anything but mobile data.
18:44:14 <nothankyou[m]> Internet permission?
18:44:14 <nothankyou[m]> Network*
18:45:04 <d3nm6ugnffwftn2j> <strcat[m] "I doubt it stopped sending verif"> You are right. For some reason I restarted my phone and it's working again. I have no idea what happened. Thanks anyway!!
18:53:23 <signalarch[m]> So if this is somewhere I apologize as I couldn't find it. What are the default apps installed with graphene?
18:53:59 <alzxjm[m]> signalarch: Not many. AOSP stock apps (clock, gallery, calendar, etc.) along with Vanadium, Auditor, and a PDF viewr.
18:55:19 <signalarch[m]> <alzxjm[m] "signalarch: Not many. AOSP stock"> So if I lookup all the aosp apps it will have all of those?
18:55:32 <dazinism> signalarch: https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/graphene-os/wiki/Apps#Pre_installed_apps
18:55:57 <dazinism> Details of how auditor works is at https://attestation.app
18:58:11 <signalarch[m]> <dazinism "signalarch: https://hub.libranet"> Thanks
18:59:24 <alzxjm[m]> dazinism: Thanks.
20:07:08 <uchihaitachi[m]> Did somebody try Cryptomator ?
21:31:46 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> anyone knows why changes are not reflected in the rom after build?
21:32:14 <bejVau8MYNHfnMYv> its like nothing was changed, same as original
21:39:22 <strcat[m]> what did you change
21:39:30 <strcat[m]> and are you sure you actually built the changed code and flashed it onto the device?
21:39:35 <strcat[m]> sounds like you made a mistake
21:39:40 <strcat[m]> your question is too vague to answer
21:52:07 <renlord> like a changelog?
21:52:14 <renlord> its published on the website
21:52:17 <renlord> zzz
22:50:16 <fomijafi[m]> My 2fa app (aegis) is failing every authentication attempt I make. I believe it may be due to my phone's time being wrong. Is anyone else experiencing this?
22:51:02 <fomijafi[m]> I have it set to use network time and all the other systems on my network have the correct time
