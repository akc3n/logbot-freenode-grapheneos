00:11:27 <strcat[m]> follow https://grapheneos.org/install
00:13:52 <fire-water56[m]> Ok folks... I do appreciate your time and I know you are repeating yourself to me, I'm sorry for that. I also understand I am consuming your time when you could be doing something more important. I think I'm just going to cook up my dinner and leave you guys alone for a bit. Maybe I just need to come back to this on a full stomach, lol
00:20:29 <analtenderloin[m> Does grapheneOS use LKRG
00:54:12 <renlord[m]> strcat: do you know which component I should be filing issues under for the camera bug. It is faulting within the Google vendor camera libraries.
00:56:49 <strcat[m]> CamX you mean?
00:56:50 <strcat[m]> Qualcomm?
01:23:59 <analtenderloin[m> Is there an explanation about why apps have a delayed launch in graphene?
01:25:06 <alzxjm[m]> https://grapheneos.org/usage#exec-spawninganaltenderloin
01:25:34 <analtenderloin[m> Thank
02:04:11 <renlord> strcat[m]: camx and com.custom.aec.*
02:04:52 <renlord> do these problems appear in the pixel4 also?
02:05:12 <renlord> maybe the camera driver for pixel3 is just dogshit
02:23:15 <strcat[m]> report it to qualcomm then
02:23:18 <strcat[m]> and google too
02:37:51 <fire-water56[m]> So for an update, thanks for the help I received earlier... I ate dinner and thought straight. My big confusion was the whole "Curl" command. I don't know what it is, (and Kubuntu did not have it from the fresh install I did earlier) but my brother found out that all I had to do was a sudo apt install curl command and it installed. Then I was able to proceed with the instructions as per the grapheneos.org install
02:37:51 <fire-water56[m]> and one thing led to another and the beautiful GrapheneOS now works on my Pixel 4 phone!!
02:47:56 <nickcalyx[m]> ðŸ¤Ÿ
03:36:38 <analtenderloin[m> Does CalyxOS borrow hardened_malloc from Graphene?
03:37:46 <renlord> hardened_malloc is a grapheneos project
03:38:49 <analtenderloin[m> <renlord "hardened_malloc is a grapheneos "> Ah okay thank you for the clarification
03:39:24 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m "Does CalyxOS borrow hardened_mal"> no CalyxOS is not using GrapheneOS's hardened_malloc project

11:40:52 <nij> Hello! So thrilled to join the community!
11:41:28 <nij> I'm sooo tired with my iOS, but kept sticking with it because I rely on some apps to scan my handwritten notes frequently.
11:41:45 <nij> Good news is that I found an alternative, and am ready to switch (finally!!).
11:42:07 <nij> I'd like to ask some questions for that. Thanks for helping ;)
11:42:10 <cn3m[m]> cheers
11:43:16 <nij> 1. What's the minimal phone that I should purchase? I heard from subreddit that pixel3 is quite good. Is there any lower-level/cheaper phone that does the job?
11:44:16 <nij> 2. If I rely on some chat apps that other countries use (e.g. LINE, which is used by Koreans, Japanese.. etc), should I expect that I might no longer be able to use it?
11:45:38 <nij> 3. I seldom use it, but Uber app can be a life saver when it's necessary. Should I expect a problem with them?
11:46:47 <nij> 4. How's the phototaking experience so far? Minimally, I need it to be able to take clear shots of my notes, and preferably chalk lectures on blackboards.
11:47:10 <nij> I think that's all :) Look forward to getting one today!
11:47:14 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <nij "1. What's the minimal phone that"> Pixel 3a
11:47:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * 1) Pixel 3a(XL) has longer support for lower price for now, until 4a has support
11:47:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> 2) depends if they have hard gms/gsf dependency
11:47:46 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> 3) uber doesn't work due to hard gms/gsf dependency
11:48:08 <theultron[m]> You can use Uber as a PWA App.
11:48:10 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> <nij "4. How's the phototaking experie"> It's ok on Open Camera
11:48:14 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> but that's just me
11:48:59 <nij> za_vilfp8kn0pcyh: Thanks! How ok is the camera? I guess it's hard to describe by words maybe I should look for photos online :)
11:49:41 <xabi[m]> Apparently uber works OK from browser

11:51:00 <nij> xabi[m]: That's uplifting news!
11:51:09 <xabi[m]> You can set a profile with google camera, but if you aren't using HDR+ on night shots and wierd light conditions open camera is ok
11:51:11 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> * it's readable for me at least, when I picture handwritten stuffs
11:51:49 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> I don't really recommend that as the SELinux rule that supports it *may* be removed real soon
11:52:04 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> As it uses the special DSP SELinux domain
11:52:10 <theultron[m]> nij: Many apps work fine in browser. For rest you can search on this reddit for compatibility. https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/
11:52:14 <xabi[m]> But for written texts I don't think that google camera offers noticeable improvements

11:54:52 <xabi[m]> There is an app called native alpha that loads many websites as webapps, it a the same as creating a shortcut to the browser but with some extra cookie and privacy options
11:57:40 <nij> AH! Forget an important thing! My internet provider is not big companies like AT&T, TMobile etc.. I'm using a very small one (the USMobile). Should I expect any problems? Also, I travel to foreign countries every now and then. I might be using their internet providers. Would that be a problem?

11:59:14 <nij> za_vilfp8kn0pcyh: what did you mean by "Pixel 3aXL has longer support"?
12:09:55 <za_vilfp8kn0pcyh> Pixel 3a(XL) has longer support than Pixel 3(XL), since the former was released later (Oct 2019) than the latter (May 2019)

17:30:36 <max_s[m]> I use the airaudio app (airaudio.eu) for streaming phone audio to an amplifier via the airplay protocol (the amp only supports airplay). This requires root on my current phone. Is there any way of acomplishing the same on GrapheneOS? I know that root is not supported, but is there an other way of streaming sound from the phone or an app like newpipe via Airplay on GrapheneOS?
18:34:16 <lev[m]> <nij "THis looks nice!

19:01:02 <retry0x[m]> No I mean Android auto in the asepct of using the cars built in screen as an extension of your phone
19:02:13 <alzxjm[m]> @retry0x:matrix.org: This does not work on GrapheneOS or any OS without Google Play Services. microG can't even get it to work.
19:02:30 <retry0x[m]> No shit
19:02:37 <retry0x[m]> look at my ask
19:03:31 <retry0x[m]> is there an open equivalent or is it even possible
19:06:14 <alzxjm[m]> <retry0x[m] "No shit"> First, no need to be hostile. We don't have to help you. Second, I did answer your question. Casting screens is not possible without Google Play Services. The Chromecast API is proprietary and does not work without Play Services. There is no other implementation. Miracast does not work. Hence my response, "This does not work on GrapheneOS."
19:06:34 <erhcetua[m]> also rule 1. :  Rule Zero or the "Don't be a dick" rule applies. Please don't engage in harassment, spamming, trolling, trying to inflame the channel, impersonating developers or moderators, or spreading misinformation.
19:07:20 <retry0x[m]> Thanks for your more specific answer, that clears things up!
19:08:29 <retry0x[m]> However I was under the assumption you didn't read my ask. I understood I couldn't even run Android auto without play services, this is what I thought you were referring to.
19:13:58 <retry0x[m]> Sorry if I was hostile! Second day without caffeine
19:17:57 <alzxjm[m]> @retry0x:matrix.org: No worries. I really, really miss Android Auto on my car's display. But I've gotten used to just using a stand/holder for the phone and maps and Bluetooth to the head unit for calls, music, and backup camera. It's fine.

19:34:30 <jonzlo[m]> Okay, thx. Downloading. A note on "Maps" in F-Droid  though: last update was 11 months ago so hopefully it's still an active project. Maps.me has been my backup for years so Maps seems enticing, otherwise.
19:35:23 <xabi[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "But.osmand from fdroid is.good"> What tts engine do you use? I use magic earth because its doesn't need tts
19:35:39 <Vicarious[m]> For any other questions, it's probably wise to ask in the off topic room "#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org" (https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org)
19:38:58 <jonzlo[m]> <xabi[m] "What tts engine do you use? I us"> Someone mentioned Mozilla's TTS. The Mycroft project has an Android AI option now but it's in its infancy. And I don't know the protocol. It may not be TTS. It's more of a general assistant. More of an Alexa or Cortana replacement.

21:04:30 <cn3m[m]> I'd buy the 4a and disable the play services personally. Maybe run the Android 11 beta
21:04:35 <main__> yeah but i dont have a phone right now and waiting multiple months wouldnt be too enjoyable
21:04:58 <main__> cn3m[m]: well true i could run android until the release

21:06:10 <cn3m[m]> Pixel 4a is marginally improved on security and even Android 11 has some hardening. Your security would be fine and with Google Play Services off so would your privacy
21:06:20 <cn3m[m]> not Pixel 3a with GrapheneOS good
21:06:21 <cn3m[m]> but idk
21:06:34 <aeonsolution[m]> if you run the Android 11 as a caveat, you might have problems with the bootloader being to new of a version when try to jump back down to Android 10 with GrapheneOS if we aren't moved yet

21:10:29 <aeonsolution[m]> we already have people that are already contributing plenty, but we need more devs to contribute and testers to test changes
21:11:10 <main__> but it would work out either way just a matter of time, right
21:11:26 <main__> i would be okay waiting a few months longer
21:11:36 <aeonsolution[m]> im optimistic so yes

21:14:37 <aeonsolution[m]> i can only speak for myself, most of the people helping and contributing 5-10 love the project and the freedom to contribute to security. something this big is unsustainable with that many devs and testers
21:15:28 <pyxel3aXL[m]>  /e/ os , liberam
21:15:39 <Vicarious[m]> <main__ "if the support would be stopped "> Personally, CalyxOS. But that isn't supported either, yet
21:15:43 <Vicarious[m]> For the 4a.
21:15:54 <pyxel3aXL[m]> But /e/ can suck a fat willy
21:16:32 <aeonsolution[m]> we need 10+ people to jump in and help imo
21:16:46 <main__> i can buy pretty much any phone right now (in a budget) what would you recommend
21:17:02 <aeonsolution[m]> if you need a starting point, let me know and i can get you started
21:17:21 <aeonsolution[m]> absent of that, people need to give money to the project if they want it to survive fullstop
21:18:26 <Vicarious[m]> <main__ "i can buy pretty much any phone "> What you could do is... Buy a 3a for now, use GrapheneOS on it as your daily, wait until it is supported on the 4a, flip the 3a and get the 4a.
21:18:38 <pyxel3aXL[m]> How do we do this? Btc has seen a nice jump last few days and my pockets are fat :P
21:19:10 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Does the project accept btc donations
21:19:13 <BalooRJ> The experience on the 3a has been great, especially since the Bluetooth bug was fixed
21:19:18 <aeonsolution[m]> yes
21:19:23 <pyxel3aXL[m]> If so can someone supply me the link
21:19:32 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/donate
21:19:34 <main__> ok maybe ill go with the 3a
21:19:37 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Ty
21:20:23 <cn3m[m]> pyxel3aXL: if you donate on GitHub it is matched
21:20:45 <BalooRJ> Is it still being matched? I donate on Github but got a notice that the matching has been maxed out
21:20:52 <Vicarious[m]> <main__ "ok maybe ill go with the 3a"> Plus, grab it used and save yourself even more. Means it'll depreciate less, too.
21:21:01 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Do I have to use a MasterCard/visa?
21:21:21 <pyxel3aXL[m]> For github
21:21:57 <BalooRJ> or Paypal
21:22:19 <cdesai> cn3m[m]: I don't think it's matched anymore
21:22:38 <main__> and then sell the used again?
21:22:42 <cn3m[m]> gotcha my bad
21:24:04 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Hmm. I'll stick with the btc option.
21:24:04 <pyxel3aXL[m]> Nice to have that added option to donate via btc and not only lamestream wayz ðŸ¤“
21:24:04 <aeonsolution[m]> its whatever credit card you want to use or a paypal account pyxel3aXL
21:24:05 <Vicarious[m]> <main__ "and then sell the used again?"> Yep. Can flash stock on it and relock the bootloader, so they'll never know another OS was on it :)
21:25:17 <main__> nice ill do that then
21:26:04 <main__> btw whats the best way to download spotify and whatsapp bc they arent on fdroid
21:26:13 <main__> do you guys use aurorastore
21:28:24 <erhcetua[m]> for spotify you have rfc repo
21:29:43 <main__> ok, whatsapp? not all my contacts use signal
21:29:47 <Vicarious[m]> Yeah, Aurora Store is the main one for most peeps, or apkmirror apparently.
21:29:55 <main__> ok nice
21:31:40 <main__> thx for the advice cu
21:31:50 <holla29> hello
21:32:09 <holla29> may i ask which app do you recommend for reciving the following emails
21:32:19 <holla29> i have a gmail account , hotmail and proton
21:32:27 <Vicarious[m]> No worries. Any more non GrapheneOS questions, feel free to pop into the off topic chat at "#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org" (https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org)
21:32:47 <holla29> which apps do you recommend for each account
21:33:04 <Vicarious[m]> Maybe just #grapheneos-offtopic if you're on irc.
21:33:58 <sailreal[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "i can only speak for myself, mos"> I'm pretty busy right now because I'm moving but in 1-2 months I'd love to put some free time (and not just money :D) into this ingenious project. I'm more into native Android app development but there are probably some jobs where I could help out, right?
21:34:44 <Vicarious[m]> Heads up, gore spammer was on another channel just a moment ago.
21:35:17 <aeonsolution[m]> who?
21:36:27 <Vicarious[m]> Dunno if you were here at the time. A few days ago (maybe last week), this room was being brigaded by some gore spammers not showing very nice things.
21:38:03 <Vicarious[m]> Just letting you guys know, just in case that happens again. The images are still burned into my eyes.
21:39:51 <aeonsolution[m]> oh, just change the URL preview to off in your settings
21:41:05 <aeonsolution[m]> sailreal nice, we could use Android developers to help
21:42:17 <aeonsolution[m]> look over this:
21:42:17 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues
21:42:17 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#development-guidelines
21:43:29 <aeonsolution[m]> the issue tracker has some issues with some apps that you might be able to help with and the development guidelines has some outlines strcat put out for contributing code
21:44:25 <aeonsolution[m]> and when you're ready just start contributing
21:44:34 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe consider adding features to seedvault, graphene's backup/restore suite?
21:44:56 <nickcalyx[m]> If you want to work on apps specifically
21:45:46 <sailreal[m]> thanks for the links and hints :) will look into it and as you said start contributing...am very excited about it :grin:
