00:30:01 <qt_pie[m]> hey so  i wrote down my veed sault key and i lost it, can i recover it somehow?
00:36:24 <strcat> set up backups again
00:41:40 <qt_pie[m]> I dont see where to get my 12 word seed again
00:56:36 <alzxjm[m]> Anyone else have a bug where Dark Mode won't turn on?
00:57:47 <cn3m[m]> <alzxjm[m] "Anyone else have a bug where Dar"> never that would be even worse than Calyx iconw
00:57:49 <cn3m[m]> i'd go to stock lol
00:58:40 <cn3m[m]> <qt_pie[m] "I dont see where to get my 12 wo"> exactly what have you done related to backups and wipes?
00:59:10 <alzxjm[m]> I see this https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/252 but mine is just that the button in the quick settings shade doesn't do anything. Stays light mode.
00:59:11 <alzxjm[m]> The toggle in display settings works
00:59:50 <cn3m[m]> alzxjm: I think Android normally does that could be wrong though
01:00:35 <alzxjm[m]> It's happened a few times. I think using the display settings toggle fixes it.  I'll see if I can replicate it.
01:21:42 <strcat> qt_pie[m]: you have to generate a new one
05:19:59 <uchihaitachi[m]> I want to ask about seedvault, I don't remember if enabling it was an option at installation or not, but it seems if it is, I didn't enable it. I tried to backup now using seedvault but I couldn't. Can someone tell me how to use it?
05:19:59 <uchihaitachi[m]> In settings, backup, seedvault is not an option, it's only internal storage and a cloud service that I have
05:21:45 <qt_pie[m]> I dont see an option to generate one
05:26:14 <uchihaitachi[m]> I guess internal storage is the seedvault ?
05:27:30 <qt_pie[m]> strcat sait to make a new one that is Micay so i assume he's correct
05:28:26 <uchihaitachi[m]> <qt_pie[m] "strcat sait to make a new one th"> I do not understand
05:28:49 <qt_pie[m]> make a new seed, but idk how
05:31:01 <uchihaitachi[m]> It seems I got wrong. Seedvault is not where the backup storage will be. It makes the backup itself and then transfer it to the location that I want
05:31:12 <uchihaitachi[m]>  * It seems I got it wrong. Seedvault is not where the backup storage will be. It makes the backup itself and then transfer it to the location that I want
05:31:59 <qt_pie[m]> well i need the 12 word seed to be generated again and im confused
05:41:53 <strcat[m]> qt_pie: disable backups, enable them again
05:49:44 <qt_pie[m]> I did that multiple times
05:50:05 <qt_pie[m]> or at least i think i did
05:50:18 <qt_pie[m]> I turned backups off and to be sure i rebooted
05:57:13 <qt_pie[m]> strcat: I did it I had to go into apps, show system apps, and clear seed vault data
06:03:39 <qt_pie[m]> is that untended functionality? shouldn't turning backups off also turn gen a new key? or is that a bug
06:37:10 <strcat[m]> GrapheneOS 2020.09.18.13 preview release: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.09.18.13
06:37:24 <strcat[m]> 1st Android 11 GrapheneOS release, will be Beta only, and might be cancelled for some devices based on testing
06:41:13 <JTL> Good work
06:47:13 <Lia[m]> Big respect to the devs
06:47:25 <Lia[m]> Will wait for the beta users feedbacks
06:54:01 <cardinaldirectio> This is great stuff, glad to see the progress on android 11
08:18:18 <lickidyspl1t[m]> ðŸ’ž amazing work guys!
08:18:32 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Smashing our this update ðŸ’ª
08:34:05 <shdudbdjdj[m]> <strcat[m] "GrapheneOS 2020.09.18.13 preview"> Thank you for your work :) When will the beta be avaible for OTA update?
09:10:03 <xabi[m]> That was quick!
09:14:55 <anon_ree1> is it a bad idea to use the Tor browser on Graphene? I'm aware of the security flaws of gecko browsers like Firefox (which Tor seems to be based on). but if you don't use Tor, you're exposing your browsing to your ISP (unless you use a VPN, which isn't as private as Tor)
09:24:56 <null[m]> I wouldn't say it's a _bad_ idea
09:26:17 <anon_ree1> null[m]: why so?
09:26:29 <anon_ree1> does Tor have proper sandboxing? mitigating the security risk that regular Firefox has?
09:26:49 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "does Tor have proper sandboxing?"> it doesn't do anything to improve it really
09:29:09 <anon_ree1> cn3m[m]: does this mean Tor isn't secure? if so, then doesn't that mean it also has privacy risks?
09:29:42 <cn3m[m]> Tor Browser is not up to par on security
09:29:51 <cn3m[m]> that can of course have privacy side effects
09:32:54 <anon_ree1> cn3m[m]: hmm ok. why would someone like Snowden, recommend it, then? I'm a bit confused about how privacy and security intermingle, and when you should choose a browser that's less secure but has better privacy features (like Tor) for instance
09:33:26 <anon_ree1> also, how do I know which Tor .apk to install from here? http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/download/index.html#android
09:33:32 <anon_ree1> there's a bunch of different versions
09:34:11 <anon_ree1> aarch64, arm, x86_64, and x86
09:34:54 <cn3m[m]> anon_ree1: Snowden has almost zero online presence
09:35:25 <anon_ree1> right, but if it's less secure. doesn'
09:35:34 <anon_ree1> * doesn't this mean this could exploit his privacy?
09:35:45 <anon_ree1> I don't really get how that works
09:36:04 <cn3m[m]> it is complicated the security of linux in 2013 was not as different from say Windows. It was much closer
09:36:34 <cn3m[m]> <anon_ree1 "* doesn't this mean this could e"> it could
09:36:56 <cn3m[m]> but I guess you would have to get him to click on a link in twitter
09:37:06 <cn3m[m]> I assume he doesn't use JS among other things
09:38:02 <lickidyspl1t[m]> <cn3m[m] "I assume he doesn't use JS among"> Surely ðŸ˜‚
09:39:16 <cn3m[m]> a no js exploit on Qubes with Whonix(which has some hardening) is still hard
09:39:19 <cn3m[m]> is it the most secure thing? Definitely
09:40:42 <cn3m[m]> not*
09:41:14 <anon_ree1> hah yeah I'd like to install Qubes honestly but the UX looks too bad for me
09:41:23 <fll[m]> To add to that: using tor browser on graphene on a separate profile is probably the most secure way available to use the mobile tor browser
09:41:54 <anon_ree1> what do you mean by separate profile? as in create another user account?
09:42:00 <anon_ree1> on the actual device
09:42:04 <fll[m]> Tes
09:42:08 <null[m]> If you use Tor the recommendation is to use the Tor Browser in order to mitigate fingerprinting against you.
09:42:08 <null[m]> This is because, while it isn't bulletproof at all, the way it was is is that TBB users have a very similar fingerprint due to the way it's configured. This means if you're not using TBB while you use Tor, your browsing habits may stick out more, and someone could track you on your travels more easily.
09:42:13 <fll[m]> *yes
09:42:24 <null[m]> <anon_ree1 "hah yeah I'd like to install Qub"> You can configure it to look not as bad, surely.
09:43:10 <anon_ree1> null[m]: probably. I'm a big fan of other distros like Pop!_OS and Ubuntu, though. I'd still consider switching regardless
09:43:18 <null[m]> Also apologies for the plethora of typos in my other reply.
09:43:19 <null[m]> I'm on mobile.
09:43:26 <anon_ree1> does anyone know which .apk file to download for Tor? I have no clue
09:43:40 <null[m]> Uhh
09:43:41 <null[m]> Get it from F-droid
09:43:47 <anon_ree1> it's not on there yet
09:43:53 <anon_ree1> you have to add some other repo to do so
09:43:59 <null[m]> You have to enable the guardian project repo
09:44:04 <anon_ree1> so I didn't bother and was just going to manually download the .apk
09:44:13 <null[m]> It's literally in the app you have to tick the box, dont you?
09:44:27 <anon_ree1> oh, the instructions I had were different. let me check
09:44:34 <anon_ree1> btw what IRC client do you guys recommend on Graphene?
09:45:40 <null[m]> In F-droid go to Settings > Repositories and Tick "Guardian Project" repo to enable it
09:45:40 <null[m]> After a sync Tor Browser should come up
09:46:06 <anon_ree1> yep just found it, thanks
09:46:23 <Lia[m]> Isn't Tor not as anonymous among Tor users in Android?
09:46:37 <anon_ree1> the repos have updated but Tor still doesn't seem to be showing up in search results... let me try manually refreshing it
09:46:37 <null[m]> Probably
09:46:45 <Lia[m]> Screen size, performance difference
09:47:15 <Lia[m]> Those alone will already give you more unique fingerprint imho
09:47:21 <anon_ree1> shrug yeah I can't find it lol
09:47:41 <anon_ree1> Lia[m]: yeah it would but surely a decent amount of people still use it on Android right?
09:47:46 <null[m]> <Lia[m] "Those alone will already give yo"> That doesn't even have to be "in your opinion"
09:48:34 <null[m]> <anon_ree1 "shrug yeah I can't find it lol"> Search "Tor Browser"
09:48:49 <anon_ree1> null[m]: I did, no results for it
09:48:58 <anon_ree1> I've updated the repos too
09:49:06 <anon_ree1> also restarted the app
09:49:20 <wrfhf[m]> <Lia[m] "Those alone will already give yo"> Yes
09:49:32 <Lia[m]> Not sure, all I know is it'd stand out, and it's not even as homogenous as Desktop Tor
09:50:13 <null[m]> I figured TBB on Android would try and spoof some of the desktop values and whatnot but you never know with the Tor peeps
09:50:56 <anon_ree1> there we go found it just glanced over it because it didn't have an icon lol
09:50:57 <Lia[m]> It doesn't even matter if you can spoof it or not,due to unresizeable windows
09:51:25 <Lia[m]> But yeah, it'd still be similar, somehow
09:51:43 <anon_ree1> what IRC client do you recommend on Graphene?
09:51:45 <null[m]> <anon_ree1 "there we go found it just glance"> It should have an icon. Probably hasn't loaded yet
09:52:31 <null[m]> Revolution IRC looks alright
09:52:31 <null[m]> But I had some issues connecting to some servers a while back
09:52:33 <anon_ree1> yep there is once installed just not on the app store. have noticed that with a few apps
09:52:39 <anon_ree1> thanks

09:53:55 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Wtf is this?
09:54:06 <lickidyspl1t[m]> I cant find it in system apps normally.
09:54:36 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Or is just some netgaurd shit
09:54:41 <anon_ree1> what is the benefit for using matrix with IRC?
09:54:51 <louipc> none
09:55:02 <cn3m[m]> matrix allows you to save the history
09:55:04 <cn3m[m]> I use it for all the irc
09:55:21 <louipc> except if someone deletes their postings
09:55:29 <null[m]> <lickidyspl1t[m] "Screenshot_20200919-195334.png"> Those system apps share the same uid iirc
09:55:30 <louipc> then irc is the only one you can save everything
09:55:54 <anon_ree1> oh ok
09:55:54 <null[m]> Nvm
09:56:00 <null[m]> Didn't look at the screenshot properly
09:56:24 <lickidyspl1t[m]> The "root"
09:57:14 <louipc> anon_ree1: remember how to join offtopic chan?
09:57:20 <lickidyspl1t[m]> Can someone try replicate it for me?
09:59:36 <null[m]> Not on graphene, sorry
09:59:36 <null[m]> But I recall when using the shite that is Afwall years ago I would get the same app in the list
09:59:36 <null[m]> I'm pretty sure it's normal
10:12:32 <lickidysplit-pti> Shit I forgot to leave on my other accounts ðŸ˜‚ Mods can u boot lickidyspl1t / lickidysplit
10:14:54 <louipc> they wont hurt anyone
10:15:14 <null[m]> ...or will they?
10:16:10 <lickidysplit-pti> Sure hope not ðŸ˜‚
10:16:10 <cn3m[m]> louipc hey thanks again for volunteering ^
10:16:29 <louipc> np
14:51:18 <mrxx_0[m]> Hey, I was on the beta that had the "your phone can't load android system" after the update. I switched back to stable release in the settings and still have that bug. What should I do ? Backup and restore to stable ? Thanks !
14:52:29 <mrxx_0[m]> Atm my 3a XL is on : QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.10.05
14:53:08 <strcat[m]> mrxx_0: read the release notes
14:53:17 <strcat[m]> don't use beta if you aren't going to follow announcements and release notes
14:53:36 <strcat[m]> switching back to stable channel for updates just changes which future updates you get
14:54:01 <strcat[m]> it doesn't undo that you were using beta and got a release through it that had to be cancelled for various reasons and has caveats for upgrading
14:54:09 <strcat[m]> read what's written in the release notes about it please
14:54:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> [dan-v](https://matrix.to/#/@danvittegleo:matrix.org)
14:54:51 <anupritaisno1[m]> [strcat](https://matrix.to/#/@strcat:matrix.org): that him ^
14:54:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> ?
14:55:19 <mrxx_0[m]> Yeah I didn't go back to the release
14:55:29 <mrxx_0[m]> I'll wait :)
14:56:00 <strcat[m]> anupritaisno1: yes
14:56:39 <mrxx_0[m]> I saw the release note when the update was pushed but I don't remember the note for the A11 or reset ! I will still stay on beta
15:10:55 <derpy> the battery settings for an app I use look OK, but "Enable Background App refresh" is supposed to fix it on regular android... any idea the equivalent in GOS?
15:11:05 <derpy> https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/87858/whatsapp-web-phone-not-connected -- referring to this
15:31:58 <engulf[m]> On GOS it should be enough to disable "Battery optimizations" for WhatsApp: Settings > Apps & notifications > Special app access > Battery optimization
15:32:38 <engulf[m]>  * derpy:  On GOS it should be enough to disable "Battery optimizations" for WhatsApp: Settings > Apps & notifications > Special app access > Battery optimization
19:23:46 <derpy> engulf[m] for whatsapp that says "not optimized" -- and lists 6 things that say "battery optimization not available"
19:23:54 <derpy> so it is just not available?
19:42:36 <strcat[m]> derpy: if it says not optimized, that means at some point you accepted disabling battery optimizations for the app or did it yourself
19:42:41 <strcat[m]> that's never the case by default for an installed app
19:42:55 <strcat[m]> an app can prompt to request that you disable battery optimizations for it
19:43:22 <strcat[m]> all disabling battery optimizations really means is that the app can connect to the network at all times, it's otherwise up to the app to bypass battery optimizations via standard APIs
19:43:45 <strcat[m]> such as running a foreground service or relying on special alarms that bypass doze, etc. but still have some restrictions
19:44:07 <strcat[m]> the only thing disabling battery optimizations really does is make it so that it can connect to the network when doing that
20:42:00 <uchihaitachi[m]> I want to ask if yubikey is secure to use on my phone? Anyone had a personal experience with them?
20:57:14 <alzxjm[m]> uchihaitachi: they're secure. Good way to manage TOTPs
21:11:19 <deetot> Got no experience with yubikeys but I have a nitrokey and it's great

22:42:15 <bypassbobby[m]> <jpds "bypassbobby: It looks like you'r"> Yeah i got off fdroid I'll download newer version thanks.
22:49:44 <uchihaitachi[m]> the one on F-Droid from the Guardian Project is 16.3.1, Beta 1-0.4.2..., while the version on the Play Store, using Aurora Store, provided by the Tor Project is 16.3.1, Beta 2-0.4.3..., which seems slightly updated.
23:04:13 <bypassbobby[m]> Thanks for that its up and running now
23:14:15 <bypassbobby[m]> Does anyone chain tor with a normal VPN
23:46:56 <jpds> bypassbobby[m]: Yes
23:58:28 <bypassbobby[m]> <jpds "bypassbobby: Yes"> How's it done on graphene? It seems like Its one or the other
23:58:54 <lickidysplit-pti> Start ur VPN and set it to auto connect.
23:59:08 <lickidysplit-pti> Run orbot.
23:59:44 <lickidysplit-pti> Ur VPN will drop but reconnect
23:59:56 <bypassbobby[m]> Does that go through VPN then to the tor network? Or other way around
