00:00:02 <strcat[m]> please read the FAQ sections on this, it's more than one section
00:01:43 <strcat[m]> and again, if people want more devices to be supported, they're welcome to work on it
00:01:47 <strcat[m]> they're not welcome to complain about it here
00:01:52 <strcat[m]> it will result in a ban, it's a tired topic
00:02:30 <CaptainBlackton> Yes, I was starting to read the other sections too, but I wanted to thank you in the meantime. And the reason I would doubt Google hardware is because Google's whole business model is based on spying. But I'm just saying "guilty by association" without any hard evidence to believe the hardware has loopholes in it. That's why I was asking, because I figured someone here might actually know what the hardware is
00:02:30 <CaptainBlackton> like, unlike me.
00:03:09 <strcat[m]> so, yes, you don't know what you're talking about, and you have weird ideas about Google, so you're here spreading FUD
00:03:16 <strcat[m]> please read the FAQ and don't do that in the future
00:03:44 <CaptainBlackton> OK
00:04:16 <strcat[m]> if you want further device support, work on it
00:05:04 <strcat[m]> you'll have less security with other currently available devices though and at best they will offer comparable privacy that's more prone to being bypassed
00:05:10 <strcat[m]> there are not better devices available right now
00:05:36 <strcat[m]> we welcome contributions, but complaining about something like lack of broader device support here isn't productive
00:05:58 <strcat[m]> as it states on that page the goal of the project is not broad device support and devices need to meet a basic set of requirements, which most don't
00:06:34 <strcat[m]> I think the FAQ sections cover the high level details well already
00:07:52 <strcat[m]> other devices that are reasonably secure and meet the basic requirements tend not to support using a different OS, and if they do, they usually don't support installing it securely with the standard hardware-based security features
00:08:42 <strcat[m]> there are not many devices that could be supported and in fact no one has identified another one meeting even basic, limited requirements at this point - but that's largely because people have not worked on doing that
00:40:14 <whatisthematrix[> I have a pinephone? Anyone else want to try and get grapheneOS on it?
00:41:38 <Golli[m]> Please don't think that will be secure.
00:43:51 <ompe[m]> The OS is custom made for the types and specs that are listed on the web page. You could try to flash an unsupported phone, but don't expect it to get you a good result.
00:44:49 <JTL> At most I see pinephone beiing a device for testing shit :P
00:51:21 <Golli[m]> The Pinephone and Librem 5 aren't ready to support a good security model.
00:51:22 <Golli[m]> The only things they can currently offer is hardware switches (useless btw) and easy to replace parts.
00:51:52 <JTL> pmuch
00:52:12 <JTL> and outside of "prototype/devkit" units, barely anyone has a librem 5 lol
00:52:19 <JTL> Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
00:53:37 <louipc> userman23[m]: maybe just dns problem?
00:53:58 <Dylanger[m]> > <@golli:matrix.kiwifarms.net> The Pinephone and Librem 5 aren't ready to support a good security model.
00:53:59 <Dylanger[m]> > The only things they can currently offer is hardware switches (useless btw) and easy to replace parts.
00:53:59 <Dylanger[m]> Yeah I heard someone flipped it one day
00:54:04 <Dylanger[m]> And it didn't do anything
00:54:10 <louipc> wat
00:54:43 <louipc> it would be cool to see grapheneos on android one phones
00:55:29 <TheJH> Golli[m]: what makes the hardware switches useless?
00:55:31 <louipc> i'd think that would be the next step after pixel
00:56:16 <Dylanger[m]> <louipc "i'd think that would be the next"> Next step I believe is getting a relationship with an ODM, I don't know tho
00:56:17 <louipc> after web flash tool, after app store, after... stuff
00:56:25 <Golli[m]> I'm not on about them not working, they work and they do their job, but having the switches as physical things instead of a toggle in the software is utterly unneeded.
00:56:26 <louipc> yea maybe
00:57:31 <louipc> Dylanger[m]: what just to remove the 'alternative OS' boot warning? :p
00:57:42 <Golli[m]> And if you think the Librem 5's lockdown mode is useful, why would you not use a notepad and pencil or even one of the eink devices?
00:58:55 <Golli[m]> Plus
00:58:56 <Golli[m]> > The hardware itself lacks many modern security features too such as proper verified boot, a hardware-backed keystore (some PGP smartcard is not equivalent) and more.
00:59:15 <Golli[m]> https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux-phones.html is a good read for it.
00:59:45 <Golli[m]> I think someone posted this before.
01:01:10 <obi[m]> <Golli[m] "I'm not on about them not workin"> it's utterly the intended point
01:02:41 <TheJH> Golli[m]: that article looks a bit... unhinged to me. e.g. AFAICS the accelerometer paper it points to talks about placing an accelerometer on the chest, and only for detecting *whether* speech occurred, not what was spoken
01:03:01 <whatisthematrix[> <Dylanger[m] "Next step I believe is getting a"> ODM? == phpne maker?
01:03:11 <TheJH> Golli[m]: which is miles away from being able to record actual audio of a conversation
01:04:00 <whatisthematrix[> <louipc "Dylanger: what just to remove th"> Yeah that irks me. Only irk I have.
01:14:09 <strcat[m]> whatisthematrix: that's going to be there on anything other than a device built to run the official GrapheneOS releases
01:14:38 <hypokeimenon[m]> Keep linux phone discussion in the #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org room please
01:14:57 <strcat[m]> whatisthematrix: Pinephone does not meet the most basic privacy and security requirements for GrapheneOS, you could only make an incomplete unofficial port
01:15:42 <strcat[m]> Android is Linux-based, those aren't "Linux phones" as opposed to regular ones
01:17:28 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> Android is possibly getting mainline Linux so they'll just be userland differences soon
01:17:31 <strcat[m]> Golli: the issue with hardware kill switches is that they're generally not properly designed, and they only defend against an attacker that has already compromised the device, obtained the data and can exfiltrate data whenever a network or another approach is available
01:18:05 <strcat[m]> a7-j7b5g5: I think you're confused if you think traditional Linux distributions use mainline Linux
01:18:29 <strcat[m]> a7-j7b5g5: Android works fine with a mainline kernel, but you wouldn't use that in production
01:18:46 <strcat[m]> mainline means the x.0 releases from Linus without any patches applied
01:19:14 <whatisthematrix[> What are most android devices -- patched kernels then?
01:19:45 <strcat[m]> only the x.0 releases are mainline, other releases come from forks
01:20:09 <strcat[m]> whatisthematrix: Linux distributions, including Android, don't use mainline Linux kernels for the most part
01:20:54 <TheJH> whatisthematrix[: FYI there are official "stable" Linux kernel releases with names like 5.4.3; those are not "mainline", but they are official upstream kernels that you can download from kernel.org
01:21:11 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> I know not kernel.org mainline but google is working for a shared kernel shared between phones
01:21:25 <strcat[m]> there's a kernel.org repository forked from the mainline kernel repository providing stable / longterm branches downstream from it, and those are what nearly every forks for their actual kernels
01:21:30 <TheJH> whatisthematrix[: and then android has more stuff piled on top of that
01:22:17 <strcat[m]> the stable / longterm kernels backport a subset of bug fixes including a lot of security fixes
01:22:39 <strcat[m]> Android works fine with mainline or the kernel.org stable / longterm branches, it doesn't need modifications
01:23:28 <strcat[m]> the Android common kernel has branches based on each stable/longterm branch backporting a bunch of extra bug fixes along with backporting features and performance improvements
01:23:36 <strcat[m]> and it adds a few optional downstream features
01:23:36 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> Project mainline was announced a while ago. So you can use a kernel.org kernel on all new android phones if google sees its worth it
01:23:50 <strcat[m]> a7-j7b5g5: you're making misleading statements that aren't accurate
01:24:09 <strcat[m]> that's not what project mainline, it doesn't refer to mainline Linux kernels
01:24:31 <strcat[m]> and Android already works with a mainline or stable / longterm kernel
01:25:02 <strcat[m]> the Android common kernel doesn't have mandatory changes from them anymore, only optional ones
01:25:55 <strcat[m]> device support is a separate thing orthogonal to Android support
01:26:07 <strcat[m]> and Android does not require kernel changes since some time ago
01:26:57 <strcat[m]> there are only optional changes via the Android common kernels: many additional bug fixes, backported features, backported performance improvements and various frills like VMA naming
01:26:58 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> I know that. I'm just saying I seen a article about mainline how google is exploring one kernel for all devices
01:27:27 <strcat[m]> it's not what project mainline refers to
01:27:43 <strcat[m]> it's a different meaning of mainline not to do with Linux
01:28:35 <strcat[m]> and it's not the same topic as Android support - all mandatory features are fully upstream already
01:28:52 <strcat[m]> Android works fine with a mainline or stable / longterm kernel
01:29:15 <strcat[m]> sure, you have to have support for the hardware - as with any other Linux-based OS
01:30:09 <strcat[m]>  * sure, you have to have support for the hardware implemented - as with any other OS - and there is a lot of hardware not supported or only partially supported upstream
01:30:40 <strcat[m]> it takes years for hardware support to make it upstream, and it's rarely completed there
01:31:43 <strcat[m]> and if you're using a longterm kernel branch suited for production usage, that isn't receiving any newer hardware support, only bug fixes
01:32:15 <strcat[m]> the stable and longterm kernels in the linux-stable repository forked from the main repository only get bug fixes
01:32:41 <strcat[m]> the newest longterm branch is 5.4, that's the newest choice you could make if you were putting together a product right now
01:33:27 <strcat[m]> perhaps it takes you a year to make the product and develop all the drivers, etc. and you work on starting the process of landing stuff upstream once it's ready
01:33:32 <strcat[m]> the product launches
01:33:43 <strcat[m]> a year later, a lot of support for it has landed upstream
01:34:11 <strcat[m]> 5.4 is never getting that, and it's 2 years old
01:34:43 <strcat[m]> and right now, support for devices is rarely ever completed upstream and only even starts to resemble usable support 3+ years after hardware becomes available
01:35:24 <strcat[m]> so you could perhaps build a device with an obsolete SoC without proper support from 3 years ago using Linux 5.4
01:35:29 <strcat[m]> anyway that doesn't have to do with Android specifically
01:36:16 <strcat[m]> Android itself works fine with a mainline or stable / longterm kernel
01:36:55 <strcat[m]> a sane production product is going to use a longterm kernel, and the Android common kernel longterm branches are highly advisable to have more bug fixes and backports of important security features, performance improvements, etc.
01:38:44 * Lia[m] is curious how would GKI affect the device support time by Android 12
01:38:48 <strcat[m]> a7-j7b5g5: the generic kernel project you're talking about is about defining a stable ABI for a longterm kernel branch so that all drivers for hardware support that aren't already available in it can be separately updated - it does NOT get rid of the need for those drivers
01:39:21 <strcat[m]> they are STILL tied to a specific longterm kernel version, you STILL need them for hardware support, and you STILL need updates to them
01:39:44 <strcat[m]> sure, it lets you update the base kernel separately from out-of-tree drivers
01:40:14 <strcat[m]> doesn't change that the drivers need to be supported and doesn't change that the drivers are tied to a specific longterm kernel branch
01:41:00 <strcat[m]> in theory, if all the drivers were landed upstream, you could pick a newer longterm kernel branch, spend a long time fixing all the regressions including making the drivers all work properly again
01:41:09 <strcat[m]> and then ship an update to that newer longterm kernel branch
01:42:13 <strcat[m]> which, due to the high rate of Linux kernel regressions, will likely have serious regressions that slip through to users and need to be continue to be fixed
01:42:28 <strcat[m]> and also, code being upstream does not imply it is maintained, and it does not imply it will continue working
01:43:15 <strcat[m]> there is tons of churn, and those drivers are not being regularly tested, people have to notice the regressions on specific hardware and then deal with getting it fixed
01:43:31 <strcat[m]> it doesn't remain in a working state, you have to pick a new longterm branch and fix everything, even if you got all your drivers upstream
01:44:20 <strcat[m]> you can't just update to each new longterm branch even if all your drivers are upstream because half of them are going to be in a broken state with varying degrees of serious bugs for any given kernel version
01:44:33 <strcat[m]> you have to invest in updating to it, and that's after upstreaming all drivers
01:45:06 <strcat[m]> and your drivers might not be accepted, you may have to heavily change / rewrite them in order to get them accepted
01:45:17 <strcat[m]> you may get conflicting demands from different people
01:46:24 <strcat[m]> it requires a huge effort to get it all landed there, and it's not going to magically keep working through all the churn, you need to invest in testing the hardware with mainline and continue to keep your stuff working through continued maintenance (it's going to keep breaking and needing to be fixed, and mainline releases are not delayed for reasons like that)
01:46:44 <strcat[m]> if it works for Linus on his hardware, he's going to release it
01:46:46 <strcat[m]> that's the standard
01:47:08 <strcat[m]> there are mainline releases where an entire architecture is broken
01:48:06 <strcat[m]> I think if you've used a mainline kernel with a rolling release Linux distribution on a laptop, even a very common laptop used by a lot of kernel developers with common hardware used by a lot of them
01:48:16 <strcat[m]> you'll be aware that hardware support regresses, over and over in different ways
01:48:39 <strcat[m]> you get an update an suspend doesn't work anymore - maybe one day it is fixed and works again, maybe not
01:49:03 <strcat[m]> maybe sound breaks, maybe Wi-Fi, maybe some aspect of USB (USB is perpetually broken in different ways)
01:49:56 <strcat[m]> you can't actually ship mainline kernels for anything serious, you use longterm branches, and you probably need bug fixes beyond what's there
01:50:15 <strcat[m]> and even stable / longterm kernels have this issue despite ONLY fixing bugs because they are not broadly tested / reviewed either
01:50:34 <strcat[m]> you can't just safely ship those bug fix only LTS updates without careful testing
01:51:51 <strcat[m]> so for example, right now, Qualcomm is developing future SoC generations and their driver support, they're probably developing drivers for the Linux 5.4 LTS branch right now, for unannounced hardware
01:52:01 <strcat[m]> so they'll launch the hardware, and start upstreaming support for it (which they do)
01:52:18 <strcat[m]> phones will launch with it shortly after (since they had access before it was public)
01:52:23 <strcat[m]> that's how hardware launches work in general
01:52:33 <strcat[m]> so N years later maybe there is near full support in mainline
01:52:58 <strcat[m]> up to a year after that a new LTS branch is created which now has the full hardware support
01:53:05 <strcat[m]> and it can then be fixed there to work fully
01:53:43 <strcat[m]> so basically, in an ideal scenario right now, where the company heavily invests in upstreaming support post-launch, maybe you can use the upstream longterm kernel without anything out-of-tree ~2-3 years post launch
01:53:57 <strcat[m]> so, in theory, if the company wanted to, they could do all that and then migrate to that newer LTS
01:54:04 <strcat[m]> and then invest in migrating to future LTS versions
01:54:12 <strcat[m]> so yeah ideally that would happen
01:54:19 <strcat[m]> they have to keep maintaining all the userspace code and firmware too
01:54:50 <strcat[m]> the lifetime of LTS kernel branches is not really the bound on device lifetime yet
01:54:58 <strcat[m]> they'd need to be supported 4+ years for that to start being the case
01:55:41 <strcat[m]> even then.... hardly any resources are actually invested in the kernel.org longterm branches
01:55:48 <strcat[m]> it's a few people doing most of the work part time
01:55:54 <strcat[m]> they have other stuff they work on too
01:56:41 <strcat[m]> a company that assigned 5 full time employees to maintaining a Linux kernel LTS branch would be putting in more resources than the total sum of the resources put into it by EVERYONE ELSE in total
01:57:44 <strcat[m]> the kernel.org longterm releases are mostly gregkh allocating a fair bit of his time to backporting things, mostly changes marked in the commit message as being sensible to backport to stable kernels, and a few other people dedicating some time of their own
01:57:49 <strcat[m]> occasional contributions from others
01:58:03 <strcat[m]> hardly any systemic testing, hardly any review, etc. just like the rest of Linux development
01:58:57 <strcat[m]> people have this idea that because a huge amount of resources goes into adding code and making it increasingly more complex to add features, make it scale better, etc. that there are similar resources put into stability, testing, review, security, etc. but it's not the case at all
01:59:44 <strcat[m]> and also having most drivers in-tree as part of the same git repository due to lack of a stable ABI for drivers means there's a ton of churn for that
02:00:26 <TheJH> strcat[m]: there are stable ABIs for some driver things. they're called VFIO and FUSE and so on :P
02:02:17 <strcat[m]> TheJH: ideally all drivers would be in userspace via versioned ABIs
02:02:35 <TheJH> strcat[m]: why even versioned
02:02:58 <strcat[m]> TheJH: so you can fix privacy, security, stability, performance issues in the ABI
02:03:07 <strcat[m]> and then if you don't need older drivers you can turn off the legacy support
02:03:17 <strcat[m]> but yeah no changes that aren't actually important
02:03:40 <TheJH> strcat[m]: and for many of these things the kernel-side APIs are already in place
02:04:02 <strcat[m]> what google is doing for generic kernels is not as impressive or useful as it sounds
02:04:12 <strcat[m]> they are just freezing a subset of the ABI within an LTS branch
02:04:21 <strcat[m]> it has no benefit to us
02:04:23 <TheJH> strcat[m]: one of my favorite examples is how bluetooth keyboards/mice work
02:04:33 <strcat[m]> just like APEX has no direct benefit for us
02:04:59 <TheJH> strcat[m]: where actually a userspace daemon is injecting input events
02:05:00 <strcat[m]> the only benefit of APEX is that now something can be made an APEX to make it have out-of-band updates
02:05:07 <strcat[m]> so therefore
02:05:16 <strcat[m]> they are not going to be inclined to just remove it from AOSP to do that
02:05:29 <strcat[m]>  * they are not going to be inclined to just not implement things in AOSP to avoid that issue
02:05:48 <strcat[m]> so for example, they did U2F/FIDO2 support in Play services so that they could bring it to existing devices and update it out-of-band
02:06:07 <strcat[m]> now, it could be done as an APEX instead, and could be added via an existing APEX
02:06:13 <Dylanger[m]> <strcat[m] "the only benefit of APEX is that"> I'm worried Google will 🔪 AOSP via slowly claiming AOSP components, building them and providing them as blobs
02:06:35 <Dylanger[m]> * I'm worried Google will 🔪 AOSP via slowly claiming AOSP components, building them and providing them as blobs/apex update-able
02:06:38 <strcat[m]> they haven't shown any sign of doing that and the APEXes are built and tagged in AOSP
02:06:45 <strcat[m]> if they aren't open source they wouldn't be part of AOSP anymore
02:06:55 <strcat[m]> so then it's not an APEX
02:06:58 <Dylanger[m]> Fair point
02:06:59 <strcat[m]> it's some app you install
02:07:27 <strcat[m]>  * so then it's not an APEX for the base OS, it's something else
02:07:41 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: they've already been able to put whatever they want in Play services and yet
02:07:45 <strcat[m]> actually take a look at what they've put there
02:08:01 <strcat[m]> Play services is 99% clients for Google services
02:08:18 <strcat[m]> sure, there is 1% of it that is not actually directly tied to Google services and really should be in AOSP but it's only a few things
02:08:31 <strcat[m]> and I don't think that it would have happened if the OS had already been split into APEX components
02:09:27 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: so for example, engineers at Google wanted to ship U2F / FIDO2 support - if they added it to AOSP, it would show up on Nexus devices in the next major release... and most users wouldn't get it for a long time since they don't use devices closely following the updates
02:09:56 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: and, before APEX, shipping updates to that functionality would require the device maker to update it
02:10:30 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: so, they had a major incentive to shove it in Play services despite it not belonging there - because it does things a regular app cannot do, so it can't just be a regular app
02:10:57 <Dylanger[m]> Huh, I see
02:11:15 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it's different now, due to APEX and them mandating that vendors shipping Play services agree to shipping Google builds of many APEX components (which are open source and tagged on AOSP repos)
02:11:45 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: APEX is part of AOSP and the releases for 'Mainline' are tagged
02:12:02 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: it has no use to us
02:12:21 <strcat[m]> November update for AOSP was released, we updated the OS to it
02:12:35 <strcat[m]> we have no use for building the November APEX release and shipping it separately via an app repo
02:12:42 <strcat[m]> we updated the OS anyway, it has the updates
02:13:03 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: same goes for their generic kernels, we don't have a use for it
02:13:31 <strcat[m]> and we want minimal attack surface and complexity so we'll still be building specialized kernels
02:13:50 <strcat[m]> it would be a regression from how we do things now if we actually switched to that
02:13:57 <strcat[m]> Dylanger: in fact, they're going to make our life harder with that
02:14:13 <strcat[m]> because they're going to build most of the drivers as dynamic kernel modules and then they won't be testing not having them as dynamic kernel modules
02:14:38 <strcat[m]> so, great, a whole bunch more initialization race conditions where drivers try to initialize themselves before the firmware for the hardware can be loaded from vendor
02:15:04 <strcat[m]> and in general, the developers of the drivers no longer testing / supporting not building it as a dynamic kernel module
02:15:18 <strcat[m]> it will become more difficult for us to build minimal kernels specialized to devices
02:15:27 <strcat[m]> I am not looking forward to it
02:15:32 <strcat[m]> it has no value to offer us
02:15:32 <Dylanger[m]> Oof
02:15:32 <strcat[m]> just pain
02:15:49 <strcat[m]> it does not mean the drivers will be supported longer
02:16:01 <strcat[m]> I guess the value it will offer is that they'll start shipping LTS updates ASAP themselves
02:16:13 <strcat[m]> and it'll be easier to ship the LTS updates
02:16:17 <whatisthematrix[> Oooof
02:16:19 <strcat[m]> but the drivers still need their own maintenance / updates
02:16:35 <strcat[m]> and it's going to be harder for us to build them the way we want with maximum CFI granularity, etc
02:28:12 <renlord> speaking of cfi granularity, was anyone able to figure out the media bug with vanadium some releases ago
02:28:19 <renlord> the actual root cause?

04:15:50 <renlord> i dont necessarily agree that google is out and about invading people's privacy, more often than not, they do offer you a choice to opt out if you really mind.
04:16:56 <scm5168[m]> <Lia[m] "Maybe was related, but was for m"> I tried adding the APNs using activity launcher; no change. I tried resetting the wifi, networking, and bluetooth again, also no change. I guess I'll do a factory reset next. Thanks
04:18:39 <Lia[m]> <renlord "i dont necessarily agree that go"> It's okay, but the mere fact that gms exist is a pain to deal with and has consequence with the app ecosystem as a whole
04:19:19 <Lia[m]> <renlord "i dont necessarily agree that go"> Like the nonfunctional opt out of ad ID that still sends it to FB SDK?
04:20:21 <Lia[m]> <renlord "i dont necessarily agree that go"> The default and nagging methodology to opt to privacy invasion is a pain to deal with. And it's not only Google who has problem with stock OS, the carrier vendors too
04:21:19 <renlord> perhaps to poweruser, it is perceived as a nagging, but to the laymen, it could be their first-time being informed of a particular convenient feature
04:21:48 <Lia[m]> <renlord "perhaps to poweruser, it is perc"> That's fair
04:22:11 <renlord> that being said, most laymen do not particularly care about erosion of their privacy and would elect to enable features that compromise privacy while providing increased convenience and user experience.
04:22:47 <Lia[m]> <renlord "that being said, most laymen do "> Yeah, sadly.
04:23:11 <Lia[m]> Socially engineered to prioritize convenience over anything else.
04:23:25 <renlord> RE: Android ad ID, iiuc, Apple IDFA has the same problem also?
04:24:14 <Lia[m]> <renlord "RE: Android ad ID, iiuc, Apple I"> I cannot vouch this for myself as I never used for iOS, but there are reports that apps has to respect the opt out or  will not be accepted to App Store

04:25:32 <a7-j7b5g5[m]> Most users don't care because ignorance is bliss
04:27:42 <Lia[m]> <renlord "https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/1"> Ngl, it's getting a little OT, but not too surprised about this news.
06:34:51 <cn3m> Apple IDFA had been fully opt out for a long time
06:34:53 <cn3m> It is now auto opt out
06:35:13 <cn3m> And it’s a real opt out unlike the Android version which is a soft opt out and requires the app dev to play nice
06:36:56 <cn3m> iOS setup is equivalent to the AOSP setup. Just avoid the Play Services option as it still lets apps get the ID and they are sent in
06:40:59 <Lia[m]> <cn3m "And it’s a real opt out unlike t"> Is it (borderline) useless unless you disable gms?
08:00:42 <niky> Hello everyone, hope you all are doing well .. I have just received my pixel 4a and im very excited to flash gos on it . Is there anything i should know before installing it ?
08:01:45 <Lia[m]> <niky "Hello everyone, hope you all are"> Is the bootloader unlockable
08:02:14 <Lia[m]> And did you not buy it from Verizon (any Verizon Pixel is impossible to unlock bootloader)
08:03:13 <niky> yes the bootloader is unlockable & its not a verizon pixel
08:04:22 <niky> before i flash gos , do i have to save the original company firmware if in case i have to go back to it from gos?
08:05:06 <Lia[m]> <niky "before i flash gos , do i have t"> There is already a image file on Google website just in case you want to flash stock again
08:05:29 <niky> okay got it
08:05:35 <Lia[m]> <niky "before i flash gos , do i have t"> No need, just update then follow the instructions at grapheneos.org/install
08:06:45 <niky> I need to run whatsapp on my gos pixel 4a for my university. What would be the best way to do so ?
08:07:23 <niky> add a different user and install it there?
08:07:56 <Lia[m]> <niky "add a different user and install"> Yes
08:07:58 <malicoye[m]> I personally don't like multi user experience. It slows down my device
08:08:24 <Lia[m]> <malicoye[m] "I personally don't like multi us"> It's okay. Not for everyone, but it's a small price to pay for better isolation
08:08:25 <malicoye[m]> What are the downsides of having whatsapp in the Main profile?
08:08:39 <Lia[m]> <malicoye[m] "What are the downsides of having"> IPC risks
08:09:08 <niky> what does IPC stand for?
08:09:30 <Lia[m]> <niky "what does IPC stand for?"> Interprocess communication, like intents from one app to another
08:09:30 <niky> does it mean the apps sharing data and talking to each other?
08:09:35 <Lia[m]> <niky "does it mean the apps sharing da"> Yes
08:09:54 <malicoye[m]> Is it actually proven at all?
08:10:04 <Lia[m]> <malicoye[m] "What are the downsides of having"> It won't slow down if you only use like two to three
08:10:07 <malicoye[m]> What data other apps do give to WhatsApp?
08:10:20 <Lia[m]> GET links, from WhatsApp to Vanadium
08:10:58 <Lia[m]> <malicoye[m] "What data other apps do give to "> Using share button, one of the apps it fetches is whatsapp
08:12:09 <niky> and also i saw a reddit post sharing a way to install a service that fakes g services so gos can run gcam can that be installed in the main user or i should install in another user with whatsapp ? or another user altogether ?
08:12:23 <malicoye[m]> So WhatsApp can sniff links from vanadium? All or some certain? What happens next?
08:13:33 <malicoye[m]> niky I have that service running in my main profile. Gcam works 9 out of 10
08:14:23 <Lia[m]> <malicoye[m] "So WhatsApp can sniff links from"> Data exflitration risks, which does not respect INTERNET permission (though it might be granted most of the time iff there is waited notifications), or downloading undesirable files
08:14:43 <Lia[m]> On the other side, it will not be sneaky or cloaked at all
08:14:54 <Lia[m]> As it requires Vanadium to be focused to do that intent (IntentDispatcher)
08:15:02 <Lia[m]> (Opening urls, that is)
08:15:56 <Lia[m]> If you want to use it in main user, just don't give it permission besides Network, and if there is no notifications to wait, disable Network access/permission.
08:15:59 <Lia[m]> Never give it storage access
08:16:58 <Lia[m]> Downside of putting it in secondary user is you need to be there to access notification, if WhatsApp has notification for no Play servcies OS
08:17:03 <malicoye[m]> That's what I do. Though I have to give it storage access for a second in order to download an attachment sent to me. In all other scenarios only Network permish is given by me
08:17:45 <Lia[m]> <malicoye[m] "That's what I do. Though I have "> I'd delete all the files, or send it to Signal self message before giving it access to all files due to danger of it tagging and identifying profile.
08:18:29 <Lia[m]> Any app that needs All Files access for me is isolated in secondary user, as it can do anything with that permission (by its definition)
08:18:33 <snowfur[m]> <Lia[m] "Never give it storage access"> The Problem then is WhatsApp won't make BackUPs of your messages anymore (and WhatsApp annoys you a bit as well?)
08:18:45 <Lia[m]> Then isolate it.
08:18:50 <Lia[m]> On secondary user
08:19:03 <Lia[m]> Question, does WhatsApp has notification in GrapheneOS
08:19:24 <malicoye[m]> Notifications work perfectly
08:19:33 <snowfur[m]> <Lia[m] "On secondary user"> But then you would need to switch the User to get new messages wouldn't you?
08:19:37 <Lia[m]> Yes
08:19:44 <Lia[m]> It depends on your usecase
08:19:49 <Lia[m]> What you are willing to sacrifice
08:19:52 <malicoye[m]> I can't send an attachment from WhatsApp to Signal without giving whatsapp File access permish
08:20:00 <niky> liam so if i want gcam on gos using that fake g services is it okay for it to be in main user ?
08:20:16 <Lia[m]> <niky "liam so if i want gcam on gos us"> Do at your own risk
08:20:37 <niky> is there any way to isolate an app in the main user space?
08:21:00 <niky> some alternative to 2nd user way
08:21:11 <Lia[m]> <niky "is there any way to isolate an a"> There is no way without giving up ownership to that user.
08:21:24 <snowfur[m]> <niky "is there any way to isolate an a"> Profiles and Work profiles
08:21:34 <Lia[m]> (By definition of device admin permission on work profiles)
08:21:46 <Lia[m]> And it is not recommended.
08:22:21 <Lia[m]> Use at your own risk, if Shelter is hacked, that whole user/profile is at risk
08:23:15 <Lia[m]> I'd do it on secondary user. Like, use primary user for light stuff, and the univeristy stuff on secondary user.
08:23:45 <Lia[m]> I don't like mixing up my digital footprints
08:24:08 <niky> so is it okay if i install gcam n whatsapp both in the secondory user ? or should make a 3rd one ?
08:24:18 <Lia[m]> <niky "so is it okay if i install gcam "> It's okay
08:25:01 <niky> any list of apps recommended for gos which i can check out after flashing ?
08:25:07 <Lia[m]> At the moment, gcam is better as it utilizes the scoped storage.
08:26:20 <niky> scoped as in sandboxed right?
08:27:15 <Lia[m]> <niky "scoped as in sandboxed right?"> Not really. All apps are sandboxed in one profile but can talk to each other.
08:27:21 <Lia[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/apps
08:28:03 <Lia[m]> <Lia[m] "https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and"> There is no exact recommendation as it depends on your use case, but there are criteria on what apps to use, and this depends on your use-case.
08:28:27 <Lia[m]> Do it at your own pace
08:30:26 <Lia[m]> Alternative to gcam is Open Camera and it is updated with Android 11 scoped storage in mind.

15:50:21 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> I remember something about you once said, it might get GrapheneOS officially one day
15:51:35 <jpds> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: No, it doesn't - they do not have a hardware security chip
15:52:31 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: no, I never said that
15:52:34 <strcat[m]> and it definitely doesn't
15:53:04 <strcat[m]> what I probably said is that maybe they make an adequately secure device in the future
15:53:10 <strcat[m]> not up to us
15:53:15 <strcat[m]> contact them
15:55:01 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat[m] "what I probably said is that may"> May I ask, is the software security the same, even without the chip? Or phrased another way.
15:55:35 <strcat[m]> yes, the software security is worse
15:55:52 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: please read https://grapheneos.org/faq#device-support
15:59:07 <strcat[m]> verified boot and attestation are just two of many examples of what GrapheneOS would not have on those devices
15:59:36 <strcat[m]> device support is covered well in the FAQ at a high level
15:59:51 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <strcat[m] "verified boot and attestation ar"> So I guess their stock devices doesn't got verified boot either?
15:59:56 <strcat[m]> and also, if you think those 2 features are primarily about physical access security, you misunderstand them substantially
16:00:06 <strcat[m]> yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: not any meaningful / working implementation
16:00:30 <strcat[m]> and again, those are 2 of many things not available there
16:01:31 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> So all in all, Fairphone is not recommended as a phone I guess, if you care  about security at all
17:03:15 <habbihabbiya3[m]> I was thinking about purchasing a used pixel but the reseller records all serial and imei numbers. Is this a big issue or should I just purchase a new device ?
17:03:40 <jpds> Even Google records the IMEI
17:05:30 <habbihabbiya3[m]> i see, can someone do anything malicious with that information  ? Someone who is not a state level player/
17:05:44 <jpds> Not really

20:14:15 <jayell[m]> argh, TheJollyRoger: can someone point me to a comprehensive guide to android 11 or AOSP 11? like to see at least cursory coverage of ALL the settings. i have scoured googles support site and their android dev site to no avail
20:18:34 <TheJollyRoger> jayell[m]: sorry, I'm not sure what you mean. https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11 has quite a bit of information on behaviour changes, new privacy features, and the new APIs on Android 11.
20:30:56 <cmattern_> Greetings, any suggestions on how to bridge the security gap created when FairEmail to access gmail which, absent Google services, requires us to use a 16 lower alpha app password instead of 2FA?
20:52:39 <jayell[m]> what is was hoping to find was a users guide of sorts, where for all settings (esp ones that have no "i" circle with basic explanatory text) some explanation was given along with possible best practices for configuring said setting. thisnis to aide a freind who is not tech challenged but is considering switching from ios to gos. for example : under 'Security' there is 'Device admin apps' and also 'Trust agents'. he is
20:52:39 <jayell[m]> looking for simple (or more in depth) info on what these are for. is there a reference that correlates directly to the settings menu?
20:55:16 <TheJollyRoger> jayell[m]: ah, that makes more sense. let me do some digging and I'll try to get back to you.
20:55:42 <TheJollyRoger> That said - the defaults on GrapheneOS are set very deliberately, you won't gain (and indeed, can definitely lose) any security by futzing with them.
20:58:45 <jayell[m]> thanks matey. thats what i thought. however, be nice the see "why" a given setting is configured the way it is. and why that choice was made is default has deviated from stock android.
21:00:35 <TheJollyRoger> jayell[m]: Completely understandable! I'll keep looking. I'm actually unsure about many of these things, but if I recall right, Device Administrators were historically used for applications that were granted special privileges and this *used to be* intended for companies to implement management apps into the phone.
21:01:03 <TheJollyRoger> These apps could do things like remote-wipe, install other apps, execute a shell, since they were supposed to be for your company to manage the handset.
21:01:21 <TheJollyRoger> However, these are in the process of being depreciated since the attack surface presented there is huge.
21:07:55 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> My understanding with the Titan chip, is that it encrypts the phone with "lots of bits" and only release the decryption key, if the correct password is given.
21:07:55 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> For phones without an secure chip, does that mean it just encrypts with the password instead? Like 6 numerical characters would be just 9.7 bits?
21:10:36 <TheJollyRoger> yzrhjocizuwkjlqo: you're close. If I recall right there are other secret parts of information that the Titan uses (I'm not sure of all of them) for key derivation but you're correct that the Titan is capable of bolstering the strength of a short pin. With respect to phones without a security chip, it tends to vary depending on the phone's CPU and the OEM's attentiveness to security.
21:13:13 <TheJollyRoger> I think around 2013 or so, Apple would actually combine the four or six digit pincode with a unique identifier contained in the phone's CPU, but that was seven years ago and phones have moved on considerably since.
21:14:15 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <TheJollyRoger "yzrhjocizuwkjlqocf: you're close"> Titan M is close to Apples Secure Enclave, right? How can Cellebrite then brute force an iPhones standard 6 pin in a couple of hours/days if the secure chip should stop that? I'm talking about Apples security chip here, as that's the only info we got about adversaries with lots of money trying to get into phones.
21:15:18 <TheJollyRoger> The Titan M is very different than Apple's Secure Enclave Processor; if I recall right what they were doing to brute force the SEP was they were spoofing the time. The Titan M contains its own timer, for this reason.
21:15:27 <TheJollyRoger> And its timer doesn't answer to the host clock.
21:15:49 <jayell[m]> on a similar note, why do i have 127 out of 127 apps being granted 'sensors' permission on fresh gos install? many are clearly not user facing apps. do all these system apps require the permission? also, clicking 'show system' or 'hide system' does not seem to hide the many system apps like it did in my pixel 2 running an earlier  "hardened-android-that-shall-not-be-named".
21:16:48 <TheJollyRoger> jayell[m]: The reason GrapheneOS has chosen to give Sensors by default is that the Sensors and Network permissions aren't a part of the Android specification. Apps have no way to specifically request them in their manifest.
21:17:32 <TheJollyRoger> So rather than break all your apps by default, GrapheneOS chose to grant them but allow you to make the call; remember that apps you install as a user are installed in a "Stopped" state, and cannot initiate until you launch them manually.
21:17:45 <TheJollyRoger> So you can choose to disallow them from the beginning, however with respect to system apps, help is wanted there.
21:18:27 <TheJollyRoger> This would likely require adding Sensors and Network to the manifest, one by one, to every single app.
21:18:41 <TheJollyRoger> And then rebasing them each time.
21:18:49 <TheJollyRoger> *each time those system apps change.
21:21:13 <TheJollyRoger> So it's not that they require sensors, it's that they have no way to ask "pretty please, can I have sensors" whether or not they actually do.
21:21:23 <TheJollyRoger> And GrapheneOS keeps this around for compatibility in that event.
21:23:00 <vsinghsanwal[m]> Hi! Can anybody confirm whether Bluetooth headsets like the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ (plus) work well with GOS? How about the app? Thank you!
21:24:23 <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo> <vsinghsanwal[m] "Hi! Can anybody confirm whether "> Not sure about the app. But the headset works just fine
21:29:15 <TheJH> TheJollyRoger: you could kinda turn them into runtime permissions though, right? let systemui synchronously pop up a dialog when an app tries to access a sensor for the first time?
21:29:39 <TheJH> TheJollyRoger: or are there a lot of apps that just access sensors for no good reason?
21:31:22 <vsinghsanwal[m]> <yzrhjocizuwkjlqo "Not sure about the app. But the "> Thank you!
21:31:38 <TheJollyRoger> Hi TheJH! I'm actually not sure, unfortunately, I'm not a developer :(

22:03:27 <TheJollyRoger> jayell[m]: When I say "help wanted there" I mean help is wanted to add the permissions to the manifest the proper way so you don't see those permissions show up for those apps.
22:06:34 <jayell[m]> ok. understood. any ideas what system apps need any of these? obviously the "Imprint" is needed by system unlocking app, and i know proximity sensor is used by phone app to turn off screen during a call.
