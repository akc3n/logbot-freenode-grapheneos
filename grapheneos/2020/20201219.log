00:09:47 <Governor_Inslee> Hi anybody here?
00:09:54 <Governor_Inslee> have a question
00:11:26 <Liakde[m]> <Governor_Inslee "have a question"> Sure, go on
00:11:34 <Governor_Inslee> so I bought a USB ethernet adaptor and it has a AX88179 chipset
00:11:47 <Governor_Inslee> it doesn't seem to work when I plug it in
00:12:08 <Liakde[m]> <Governor_Inslee "so I bought a USB ethernet adapt"> Ah, is it usbC to ethernet?
00:12:16 <Governor_Inslee> is it supported? it's supposed to..says on their website www.asix.com.tw
00:12:23 <Governor_Inslee> yeah
00:12:41 <Liakde[m]> I don't have that exact chipset, but I have a working usb C to ethernet
00:12:59 <Governor_Inslee> what chipset are you using
00:13:05 <Liakde[m]> It works on mine, and its brand is Lenovo
00:13:20 <Liakde[m]> Dunno, I haven't looked at its specs
00:13:50 <Liakde[m]> But it's usb C hub which has usb 3.0 ports, then plug usb 3.0 to ethernet/LAN adaptor
00:15:06 <Governor_Inslee> yeah I have a usb C hub as well but I think the problem is with the usb ethernet adapter
00:15:22 <Governor_Inslee> it's not being recognized
00:15:48 <Governor_Inslee> just wanna make sure the driver is included in GrapheneOS
00:16:35 <Governor_Inslee> hey Liakde
00:16:43 <Liakde[m]> hmmm?
00:16:54 <Governor_Inslee> Can you check really quickly what the chipset is with USB device info app
00:18:35 <Governor_Inslee> the one on the usb thernet adapter
00:18:43 <Liakde[m]> <Governor_Inslee "Can you check really quickly wha"> I can't find it
00:19:02 <Governor_Inslee> the app is downloadable from apkmirror
00:19:20 <Liakde[m]> AX88179 is what it says on installation CD tho
00:19:45 <Governor_Inslee> ok then it's really weird
00:27:01 <vudu> Hi everyone, i have a question. Is there a way to set up a BOOT password for grapheneos, so before grapheneos is started up to have a password
00:27:41 <vudu> Now i have only a screen lock password , not sure if i can make a boot password also that would be cool
00:28:56 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "Hi everyone, i have a question. "> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues/28#issuecomment-480276412
00:29:41 <Liakde[m]> When you restart your phone, multiple users are inaccessible before first unlock
00:35:21 <vudu> Hmm oke, and once unlocked the data is decrypted and accesable, even when i unlock it again?
00:35:42 <vudu> I would have 2 restart the phone again to encrypt the data and lock it again?
00:36:29 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "I would have 2 restart the phone"> For secondary users, you can use logout by holding restart button, and clicking end session, so yeah, the keys would be flushed, and files are inaccessible
00:36:43 <Liakde[m]> For primary/admin user, you have to restaty
00:36:49 <Liakde[m]> * For primary/admin user, you have to restart
00:37:45 <Liakde[m]> This is possible thanks to per-profile encryption in contrary to global encryption
00:38:31 <Liakde[m]> As you unlock the primary user after rebooting, only the files in the primary/admin user are accessible
00:38:42 <vudu> Hmmm okey, but when i am admin and i use my phone on a daily basis, whats the use of the lockscreen password if it only encrypts your data if you restart
00:38:43 <Liakde[m]> Unless you login in a secondary user
00:39:16 <Liakde[m]> Yes, the primary user is where you at and what is decrypted after first unlock
00:40:50 <vudu> And there is no way to keep the phone decrypted and also have network and make it useable?
00:41:26 <vudu> I tought everytime my screen locks the data is encrypted, but thats only after reboot when you have no network
00:42:31 <Thatcher[m]> Does Graphene allow the use of system cleaners like LTE Cleaner?
00:42:47 <Thatcher[m]> Or SD Maid
00:43:13 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "I tought everytime my screen loc"> well, not really, unless you reboot (lock screen before first unlock), USB peripherals is denied at lock screen though
00:43:21 <Liakde[m]> Only way would be reboot, and it's recommended to use secondary users/profiles for daily activities, and keep primary user empty and use it for only creating new users/profiles
00:43:21 <Liakde[m]> https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20201004#c5339614
00:45:14 <Liakde[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Does Graphene allow the use of s"> Unsure, did not try these apps, but doesn't clearing cache/data does the same?
00:45:42 <Liakde[m]> In the settings?
00:46:41 <Thatcher[m]> <Liakde[m] "Unsure, did not try these apps, "> Clearing cache does the same, but the manual method takes forever
00:46:54 <vudu> And if i use secundary profile with apps like signal on it, and lock the screen the data is encrypted?
00:48:41 <Liakde[m]> <Thatcher[m] "Clearing cache does the same, bu"> Trusting another app to do something the system can handle isn't really a great (privacy/security) practice imho

00:50:20 <Thatcher[m]> I just wish the system had a one-click cache clean for all apps
00:55:00 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "And if i use secundary profile w"> Quite offtopic, but I cannot find documentation about encryption at rest
00:58:31 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "And if i use secundary profile w"> This might help answer your question however. https://github.com/mollyim/mollyim-android/wiki/Data-Encryption-At-Rest
00:59:24 <vudu> Woww thanx for looking this up for me i really appreciate it.
01:01:46 <Liakde[m]> Well, I was using Molly for a good while due to it being able to have separate passphrase
01:02:02 <Liakde[m]> And handling additional layer of encryption
01:02:12 <sofa> Do Shelter works with other profile besides the 'Owner' profile?
01:03:22 <Liakde[m]> Yes, and Shelter is better off used at secondary users
01:04:24 <vudu> Okeyy maybe a dumb question, but what is molly in the link you send me???
01:04:38 <sofa> Hmm, I'm not sure why it wouldn't let me set it up that way
01:05:47 <Liakde[m]> But still not recommended due to it having ownership of that user, and granting it more power than the person using that profile however
01:05:47 <Liakde[m]> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles#Shelter
01:05:57 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "Okeyy maybe a dumb question, but"> Fork of Signal
01:07:07 <Fraya> Hey guys any idea where can i go to get help with installing grapheneos? I have tried youtube videos and i am still having problems.
01:07:36 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "Hey guys any idea where can i go"> The official installation instruction is only at grapheneos.org/install
01:07:52 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "Hey guys any idea where can i go"> You can ask here
01:08:21 <vudu> Where can i get the molly app? Aurora store? F droid?
01:09:16 <Fraya> i followed all the instructions through and i am stuck at the flashing step when i try to flash all files it gets a error in cmd and closes
01:09:28 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "Where can i get the molly app? A"> Just browse at github itself
01:09:45 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "i followed all the instructions "> Ah, what OS are you using? If it's Windows, are you using PowerShell?
01:09:56 <Liakde[m]> You should be using PowerShell, as of grapheneos.org/install
01:10:00 <Fraya> i am on a pixel 4a
01:10:10 <Fraya> i have it unlocked in the bootloader
01:10:33 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "i have it unlocked in the bootlo"> Yeah, I mean, the one you use to flash GrapheneOS
01:11:21 <Fraya> i believe its called sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03
01:12:34 <Liakde[m]> Yeah? That seems to be right. Did you set the $env already?
01:12:47 <Fraya> thats where i may be confused?
01:12:49 <Fraya> lol
01:12:59 <Fraya> i am right at that step
01:13:13 <Liakde[m]> Did you do this already: https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools ?
01:13:24 <Liakde[m]> Like, open a PowerShell window
01:14:00 <Liakde[m]> You're using Windows, right? If you got the platform tools and extracted already
01:14:22 <Liakde[m]> Do `$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"`
01:14:38 <Fraya> okay i downloaded it but i am not 100% sure where to put file
01:14:44 <Fraya> im on windows
01:14:52 <Fraya> thanks
01:15:09 <sofa> Liakde[m] I guess Shelter as a whole is pretty flawed, that's too bad
01:15:29 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "okay i downloaded it but i am no"> Then try `fastboot --version` to make sure the fastboot is detected
01:17:01 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "okay i downloaded it but i am no"> The directory doesn't matter, as long as you open the powershell and download the files there
01:17:34 <Dylanger[m]> Can confirm Google's LPA actually works perfectly on Graphene, it installed and switch to a profile just fine 👌
01:18:03 <Liakde[m]> That build seems nice?
01:18:07 <rny> Dylanger[m]: when PR
01:18:09 <rny> :P
01:18:37 <Dylanger[m]> Lol seeing as tho Google's LPA is closed
01:18:46 <Dylanger[m]> I don't think we'll be seeing that just yet
01:18:51 <Dylanger[m]> Stoked it working tho
01:19:07 <rny> many things are closed in APV
01:19:18 * rny shrugs
01:19:37 <rny> i dont think this project is that hostile to closed source stuff
01:23:14 <Fraya> okay i'm restarting and just downloaded standalone platform-tools on Windows and now im on where it says Next, add the tools to your PATH in the current shell so they can be used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script. On Windows:$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"Sample output from fastboot --version
01:23:15 <Fraya> afterwards:fastboot version 30.0.5-6877874Installed as /home/username/downloads/platform-tools/fastboot
01:23:26 <Fraya> thats where im confused
01:24:54 <Liakde[m]> Ok, now download the sunfish factory img in Powershell
01:25:18 <Liakde[m]> https://grapheneos.org/install#obtaining-factory-images
01:25:46 <Liakde[m]> Or, if you have it already: https://grapheneos.org/install#flashing-factory-images
01:26:46 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "afterwards:fastboot version 30.0"> Nice, the fastboot is detected
01:28:54 <Fraya> okay i extracted the standalone platform-tools to my desktop then re-downloaded my release OS for pixel 4a
01:29:09 <Fraya> how do i download it into powershell?
01:29:38 <Liakde[m]> Like how you downloaded platform tools
01:29:49 <Fraya> k just making sure lol
01:31:34 <Fraya> now do i just extract the OS image anywhere?
01:31:52 <Fraya> sunfish
01:32:54 <Liakde[m]> Well, do
01:32:54 <Liakde[m]> `tar xvf sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip
01:32:54 <Liakde[m]> `
01:33:02 <Fraya> in the cmd?
01:33:10 <Liakde[m]> Yes
01:33:41 <Liakde[m]> <Liakde[m] "Or, if you have it already: http"> It's in here btw
01:34:48 <Fraya>  Error opening archive: Failed to open 'sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03.zip' i got this
01:35:26 <Fraya> i just extracted sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03 to my desktop
01:36:58 <joehandcockandja> It isn't a tar file
01:37:03 <joehandcockandja> So do unzip
01:37:26 <Fraya> okay i unziped it to my desktop the whole folder
01:37:43 <joehandcockandja> How was it
01:37:53 <Liakde[m]> <joehandcockandja "It isn't a tar file"> Erm, that's what's said here, that's odd..
01:38:03 <Liakde[m]> And they are on windows, not linux
01:38:23 <joehandcockandja> Oh, oof
01:38:23 <joehandcockandja> My bad.
01:38:48 <Fraya> yeah i am having troubles lol
01:38:55 <joehandcockandja> You could also just use 7zip dude
01:39:02 <Fraya> i am using 7zip
01:39:03 <joehandcockandja> Don't you have an unzip program?
01:39:20 <Fraya> thats what i used to extract to my desktop
01:39:30 <joehandcockandja> So what's the problem now
01:39:59 <Liakde[m]> try `fastboot --version` again before you go into the directory and flash
01:40:05 <Fraya> now i need to flash my phone its already unlocked and ready to go i get an error everytime i try to run the flash all
01:40:43 <joehandcockandja> What does it say
01:40:46 <Fraya> 'fastboot' is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.
01:41:01 <joehandcockandja> Run it as root, or administrator in your case
01:41:10 <joehandcockandja> Should work then
01:41:19 <joehandcockandja> At least that's what I had to do on Linux
01:41:46 <Fraya> still same
01:41:52 <joehandcockandja> Launch cmd as admin and run the command
01:42:04 <Fraya> i did and its the same code
01:42:16 <Liakde[m]> Wait, don't do cmd
01:42:32 <joehandcockandja> Powershell, whoopsies
01:42:54 <Liakde[m]> Anyways, try `cd sunfish-factory-2020.12.12.03`
01:43:32 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "'fastboot' is not recognized as "> Ah, you shouldn't have closed the window
01:43:45 <Liakde[m]> Open a new PowerShell window, do the $env again
01:44:22 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "'fastboot' is not recognized as "> Nvm, the fastboot wasn't set yet again
01:44:28 <joehandcockandja> Couldn't he just download the fastboot program, put it in the directory, and run it like ./fastboot
01:44:54 <Liakde[m]> <joehandcockandja "Couldn't he just download the fa"> Nah, that'll make things complicated. They're almost there
01:44:58 <Fraya> $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path i typed this in powershell and nothin happened?
01:45:12 <Liakde[m]> You forgot a quotation mark
01:45:12 <joehandcockandja> I feel like setting the env is more complicated lol
01:45:26 <joehandcockandja> Whatever you guys got it I'm out
01:45:34 <Liakde[m]> It's literally one cmd line tho, and people tend to close windows
01:45:45 <Liakde[m]> So that makes thing more complicated than it should be
01:46:26 <Liakde[m]> <Fraya "$env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools"> Anyways, if "nothing" happened, try
01:54:26 <Fraya> this is so weird like i am like one of few that cannot figure this out lol

03:07:35 <Liakde[m]> Yeah, don't use Powershell as admin while flashing btw. The grapheneos.org/install is intended to follow as is and is tested
03:21:07 <joehandcockandja> Someone needs to remote into mans computer lmao
03:26:54 <Liakde[m]> <joehandcockandja "Someone needs to remote into man"> Hmmm?
03:30:02 <Liakde[m]> My bad using ` on a irc user tho
03:30:47 <joehandcockandja> Someone needs to remotely take control of his desktop in order to successfully installing GrapheneOS
03:30:59 <joehandcockandja> because he is having such trouble with it
03:31:08 <joehandcockandja> Which I doubt is because of Windows or GOS
03:31:12 <joehandcockandja> Or his phone
03:31:22 <Liakde[m]> Nah, I think it was because of copying ` on accident
07:34:25 <emsyna[m]> maybe he have issues reading
07:34:26 <Thatcher[m]> I like the process of flashing Graphene.. Makes me feel good wiping out all of Google's proprietary spyware
07:34:50 <Thatcher[m]> Just flashed another 4a for a friend
07:35:09 <Liakde[m]> <emsyna[m] "maybe he have issues reading "> Suggesting on using Powershell as admin was one of those problems
07:42:11 <Liakde[m]> Made them go in system32 and almost broke stuffs
07:43:03 <emsyna[m]> I don't know, instructions are clear enough
07:43:33 <Liakde[m]> I mean in this chat
07:43:41 <emsyna[m]> I know
07:43:54 <Liakde[m]> <emsyna[m] "I don't know, instructions are c"> People tend to close terminal/powershell windows
07:44:16 <Liakde[m]> And forget `$env:path`, `$PATH` are temporary
07:44:42 <louipc> and just double click on bat file
07:45:06 <louipc> hey what if you could launch the script in powershell via the bat file
07:45:25 <louipc> and also download fastboot and set the path
07:46:14 <louipc> and/or have all instructions just in the script
07:47:07 <Liakde[m]> Basically making a script file then
07:47:28 <louipc> yea a full 'installer'
07:47:48 <Liakde[m]> But devs wanted a USBWeb instead
07:48:00 <Liakde[m]> If I remember that right
07:48:04 <louipc> thats fine too
07:48:19 <Liakde[m]> I have no idea how that works tho
07:48:29 <louipc> well. other than it being horrible web
07:48:36 <louipc> at least its cross platform
07:48:39 <Liakde[m]> Is there even open source APIs for that stuff?
07:48:43 <emsyna[m]> actually it's better cause they basically have to click a button and then it's done
07:48:59 <emsyna[m]> assuming it's fully automated
07:49:03 <louipc> yes its new web standards
09:26:32 <rtevans[m]> Hello everyone. I have a question. I'm trying to install Graphene on my 4a. I got to the signify step but after inputting the command from the instruction page, it says
09:26:32 <rtevans[m]> " Signify: Unknown parameter '-Cqp' ". Is there a way to fix this?
09:26:32 <rtevans[m]>

10:45:52 <tryingtounlock> hi, anyone here?
10:46:57 <tryingtounlock> im having problems trying to unlock my Pixel 4a, if anyone can help
10:55:08 <nscnt> tryingtounlock: I can try. What's the issue?
10:55:46 <tryingtounlock> ok so i've read the Install section and watched 2 youtube videos on the process
10:56:06 <tryingtounlock> so when i do fastboot flashing unlock, nothing happens on the phone
10:56:36 <tryingtounlock> some other people are saying the same thing in the comments of the 2 videos, maybe recent updates broke it?
10:56:50 <nscnt> tryingtounlock: Please do not follow any videos on the internet. Only use the official guide.
10:57:10 <tryingtounlock> the official guide didn't have instructions for windows
10:57:21 <nscnt> It has
10:58:03 <tryingtounlock> ok i have no idea what "Next, add the tools to your PATH in the current shell so they can be used without referencing them by file path, enabling usage by the flashing script." means
10:58:06 <pacman37[m]> <tryingtounlock "so when i do fastboot flashing u"> Use Sudo fastboot flashing unlock
10:59:03 <nscnt> tryingtounlock: There's a command to add the tools in your PATH. Copy it into the PowerShell.
10:59:37 <nscnt> On Windows: $env:Path = "$pwd\platform-tools;$env:Path"
11:00:35 <refraction[m]> <tryingtounlock "so when i do fastboot flashing u"> Check if the Pixel drivers are installed correctly in Device Manager
11:01:38 <refraction[m]> This happened to me before and I needed to download the Android USB drivers from Google separately.
11:02:09 <nscnt> He probably misses the basic prerequisites...
11:02:10 <tryingtounlock> i do see my driver for the phone has an error in device manager thanks i'll try this
11:03:43 <anupritaisno1[m]> tryingtounlock: pm me
11:03:47 <tryingtounlock> haha the driver is literally called Android Bootloader Interface, maybe i'll be good now
11:04:37 <refraction[m]> <nscnt "He probably misses the basic pre"> To be fair, downloading the whole adb+fastboot package and installing it didn't install the drivers for the Pixel for me
11:04:51 <refraction[m]> So it took a bit of Googling to find out what's wrong
11:05:18 <nscnt> It doesn't matter. He didn't say there was a message like "Waiting for device"
11:05:53 <tryingtounlock> oho it works now, thanks refraction
11:06:24 <refraction[m]> <tryingtounlock "oho it works now, thanks refract"> Np
11:12:43 <tryingtounlock> ok now when i run flash-all.bat, nothing's happening
11:13:22 <tryingtounlock> it's the one inside the factory image file
11:14:20 <nscnt> tryingtounlock: Do you use the PowerShell? What errors do you get?
11:15:02 <tryingtounlock> i think it's cmd because it's not blue. i double clicked flash-all.bat and it disappears immediately
11:16:00 <nscnt> tryingtounlock: Would you like to write with private messages?
11:16:03 <refraction[m]> <nscnt "He probably misses the basic pre"> Sorry, you are right.
11:16:26 <tryingtounlock> i'll have to register
11:17:08 <refraction[m]> <tryingtounlock "i think it's cmd because it's no"> Please read the instructions again and follow them.
11:18:09 <refraction[m]> You should be using PowerShell and the command lines provided in the instructions.
11:18:32 <nscnt> I'm helping him in private
11:19:07 <refraction[m]> Alright then
11:57:45 <trismous[m]> <refraction[m] "You should be using PowerShell a"> Don't you also have to have administrator permissions? Or is it made in a way that uses just normal user account?
12:12:26 <tryingtounlock> nscnt has helped me all this time and now i have graphene on my pixel 4a :D
12:14:54 <digiscales[m]> Nice one nscnt very helpful
12:15:48 <nscnt> c:
12:48:02 <nscnt> tryingtounlock: You don't need to have administrator permissions, as far as I know. Opening PowerShell as admin actually causes issues, because PowerShell opens in a system's directory
12:48:11 <nscnt> oops, I meant trismous[m]
13:33:40 <emsyna[m]> this, and also useless escalation privilege, where it's not needed
14:22:40 <qubits> Hi are push notifications working on grapheneos?
14:22:51 <Golli[m]> No.
14:23:12 <Golli[m]> Apps need to have their own method of sending notifications.
14:23:19 <qubits> Okay
14:23:35 <Seferi[m]> I have Signal, Telegram and whatsapp (in container) on mine and notifications work
14:24:37 <qubits> Telegram and Signal are not anymore safe to use
14:25:02 <tiergaryen> Hi friends, can I get logs or something on the COS trolling that occurred here recently? I don't support that by any means, just genuinely curious what were they thinking.
14:25:39 <qubits> Cellbrite company have ability to access data on both
14:25:42 <Golli[m]> <qubits "Telegram and Signal are not anym"> Can you expand on this?
14:26:01 <qubits> https://www.cellebrite.com/en/blog/cellebrites-new-solution-for-decrypting-the-signal-app/
14:26:02 <Golli[m]> Is that the Israeli company?
14:26:06 <qubits> Yes
14:26:14 <qubits> byw telegram can hack anyone
14:26:15 <Golli[m]> Yeah, that's a load of rubbish.
14:26:22 <qubits> But since few days they can also hack Signal
14:26:25 <hypokeimenon[m]> <tiergaryen "Hi friends, can I get logs or so"> I don't think there was any real thinking involved. It was mostly just flooding the rooms with small chats and nods or spamming reactions.
14:26:42 <Golli[m]> The device was rooted (and iirc was unlocked)
14:26:54 <refraction[m]> <qubits "Cellbrite company have ability t"> https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/kewnzk/signal_app_crypto_cracked_claims_cellebrite_and/
14:27:35 <hypokeimenon[m]> qubits: They did not hack Signal. The methods they used required a rooted, unlocked phone. They could have just opened the app at that point, iirc.
14:27:36 <Golli[m]> > The team had access to a rooted unlocked Android device and they extracted the Signal messages from the stored files
14:27:45 <tiergaryen> hypokeimenon[m] Ok i see. Pricks :/
14:27:57 <Seferi[m]> <hypokeimenon[m] "qubits: They did not hack Signal"> exactly
14:28:13 <Seferi[m]> Even snowden shed some light on this on tweitter
14:28:28 <hypokeimenon[m]> tiergaryen: Good day to you too..
14:28:47 <tiergaryen> Hehe thanks :)
14:29:39 <qubits> I think there a lot of better solutions
14:29:49 <qubits> Threema is much better and safer
14:29:57 <qubits> I dont trust Signal
14:30:22 <qubits> Even a lot of well know cryptograh are not trusting Signal anymore
14:30:31 <hypokeimenon[m]> This is off topic, please post it in #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org
14:30:35 <qubits> Signal changed pas month a lot of in theri source
14:30:52 <qubits> OKay

15:09:20 <emsyna[m]> instructions are clear enough
15:09:24 <emsyna[m]> there is nothing complicated really
15:11:41 <justanotherlurke> <emsyna[m] "instructions are clear enough"> I agree ... but reading this chat proves that for quite a few potential users they are. And guiding them through the process means a lot of time for the helpers.
15:12:28 <emsyna[m]> i flashed grapheneOS at least 10 times (if not more) on my 3a, going as far as flashing stock,removing AVB key, and giving my phone a fresh factory installation
15:12:53 <emsyna[m]> never had an issue
15:13:19 <emsyna[m]> be it arch, ubuntu, mint, windows10, 7, fedora etc
15:14:02 <emsyna[m]> i even went as far as letting someone non technical flash my OWN phone, just overlooking what he was doing
15:14:09 <emsyna[m]> no issues either
15:14:18 <justanotherlurke> If 95% of the people have no problem, but 5% do - is it worth guiding those through the steps individually, or offering an automated solution.
15:14:18 <justanotherlurke> That's all I was thinking about and asking the experts' opinion.
15:14:29 <refraction[m]> I'd agree an installer would be nice, but Graphene is understaffed as it is.
15:14:31 <emsyna[m]> in my own eyes, it's mostly user error and not manual error
15:14:58 <emsyna[m]> you're free to contribute and make an installer
15:14:58 <refraction[m]> Making an installer would eat up more development time.
15:15:13 <justanotherlurke> <refraction[m] "I'd agree an installer would be "> Thing is, such an installer (that's why I was asking about errors in my thinking) is something someone not able to do Graphene-dev could prepare.
15:15:19 <emsyna[m]> suggesting is a good thing, but if nobody steps up in order to contribute, it's wind
15:15:22 <Liakde[m]> <refraction[m] "I'd agree an installer would be "> Stepping up from the community and doing/contributing to it would be nice
15:16:01 <justanotherlurke> <Liakde[m] "Stepping up from the community a"> That's why I asked - I hope to get my 4XL today, and instead of following the steps, I could try to do a POC install-script for it over the holidays.
15:16:22 <emsyna[m]> IMHO, having a little technical manual forces you to learn stuff as well, it's only benefits in the end
15:16:36 <emsyna[m]> if you can't do that, you're better off with an iphone
15:18:24 <emsyna[m]> it's my feedback obviously, and isn't aggressive or anything
15:18:37 <justanotherlurke> <emsyna[m] "IMHO, having a little technical "> ..preventing non-technical users from using a privacy-respecting OS that brings by default most configurations, so that the user can just use it without much finetuning?
15:19:14 <justanotherlurke> And I am not taking your feedback as aggressive, I asked for opinions, after all. :-)
15:19:18 <nscnt> WebUSB-based installation is already on the plan
15:19:39 <justanotherlurke> <nscnt "WebUSB-based installation is alr"> Ah, OK, in that case ... 👍️
15:19:49 <emsyna[m]> i know, but sometimes people likes to find the ant in order to create a pseudo conflict, just a preventive disclaimer
15:20:18 <emsyna[m]> if you heard about grapheneOS, i think you're a little bit tech savvy
15:21:24 <vudu> Hi guys, i have signal fork Molly on my pixel with grapheneos, but when molly is passphrase locked i get no push notifications of text and calls, is there a way 2 fix this?
15:21:32 <justanotherlurke> Let's say I hope to be tech savvy enough not to have any trouble installing based on the instructions provided. Soon I will know if that's true ...  😉
15:21:58 <emsyna[m]> learning is always a positive side, but yeah, always arguable
15:23:07 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "Hi guys, i have signal fork Moll"> Working as intended.
15:23:23 <Liakde[m]> It's on force stopped state
15:23:52 <vudu> I tought only the molly foss version was like that, so the normal molly also doesnt push
15:25:25 <emsyna[m]> <justanotherlurke "Let's say I hope to be tech savv"> the only thing i noticed (on windows 10) that isn't notably said is you have to install google drivers via .exe or (better IMO) via windows update
15:25:29 <emsyna[m]> sometimes it's not automated
15:25:31 <Liakde[m]> <vudu "I tought only the molly foss ver"> Nah, it is really like that. Even Signal, when force stopped, does not show notificatikns
15:25:48 <Liakde[m]> notifications, rather*
15:26:30 <Liakde[m]> Take note when Molly shreds data on RAM (during the screen is locked), you will not receive notifications, as the app is on stopped state.
15:26:32 <vudu> Okey thanx
15:29:03 <Justin[m]> Has anyone tried using the BitWarden app in GrapheneOS? Im thinking of making the switch to Graphene and I rely a lot on BitWarden
15:29:23 <Liakde[m]> I don't due to it having a toggle on accessibility services
15:30:28 <Justin[m]> Can you unpack that for me, what do you mean by toggle on accessibility?
15:30:29 <Linus[m]1> You don't have to
15:30:37 <Linus[m]1> You can just copy paste passwords manually
15:30:52 <Justin[m]> yeah thats what I do now
15:31:11 <Justin[m]> I have it on iOS and have the autofill disabled
15:31:14 <Liakde[m]> <Linus[m]1 "You can just copy paste password"> Quite not so great if you use other keyboards
15:31:30 <Liakde[m]> Using keepassDX and magikeyboard here
15:31:55 <Liakde[m]> No copy paste, just choose a database, a set of user/password, and magikeyboard can fill those for you
15:32:09 <Liakde[m]> If you don't need sync, KeepassDX is great
15:32:27 <Liakde[m]> <Liakde[m] "Quite not so great if you use ot"> Like Gboard
15:32:27 <Justin[m]> Im not tech inclined, is setting up keepass user friendly?
15:33:18 <refraction[m]> Authpass is an Android app available on F-Droid that could read KeePass databases
15:33:30 <Liakde[m]> <Justin[m] "Im not tech inclined, is setting"> I think so.
15:33:37 <refraction[m]> And I've used it a bit. It's alright.
15:33:58 <Liakde[m]> Kinda getting offtopic here, my bad, let's move it on #grapheneos-offtopic:matrix.org instead
15:33:58 <refraction[m]> r.e. Keepass' user-friendliness
15:34:16 <Justin[m]> Oh my mistake
17:42:24 <Dave77> Hey guys quick question i got the Graphene OS and i was curious if any of you know if there is any other programs like F Droid that can download apps on the device?
17:44:00 <dwkr[m]> Aurora store, which allows you to download play store apps
17:44:14 <Dave77> sweet thats what i was looking for thanks @!
17:44:45 <dwkr[m]> There are also alternative apps that access the F-Droid store, such as Foxy Droid.
17:44:49 <louipc> Dave77: there's also foxy droid and aurora droid and alternate repos. for more discussion about other apps and services please join #grapheneos-offtopic channel
17:45:27 <Dave77> thanks my bad wrong place to ask xD
17:45:35 <louipc> but having a dedicated grapheneos app manager and store is on the wishlist as well
17:46:10 <louipc> because none of the current solutions are ideal
18:17:22 <bigbat> any upadtes on fixing the screen refresh rate 60
18:42:15 <chris42> Hi Ho
18:44:03 <louipc> where
18:48:34 <chris42> Is anyone working on a Pixel 5 support? I have one here and I am building my own AOSP for it so far. Wanted to see if I can be of any use getting grapheneOS to run on it...
18:49:25 <Golli[m]> Afaik, no one is currently working on Pixel 5 support.
18:50:57 <chris42> ok, thats bad... as much as I can build my own stuff, I am no expert in it
18:50:59 <louipc> we need volunteers to maintain pixel 5 and 4a 5g
18:51:41 <louipc> its a 3 yr commitment ultimately, but i guess it wouldn't hurt if you helped get it to any stage
18:52:02 <chris42> My initial thought was/is to get it build with the original AOSP kernel as a start... then get a merged kernel...
18:52:16 <louipc> yea thats basically how its done
18:52:48 <louipc> then work out the bugs, patch, test, repeat
18:53:47 <chris42> I saw that the current manifest actually is pointing to _r20 already, so was hoping that someone is tinkering with it as I do.
18:54:02 <chris42> Would probably need to get the prepare_vendor config first?!
19:00:07 <puriato> GrapheneOS on Pixel 3 was working with former carrier, but new carrier SIMs show "no service." SIMs are working on other devices. What is it in Graphene that might be blocking service with this new SIM?
19:14:07 <qubits> Is there optio in grapheneOS to put manually APN settings
19:15:03 <puriato> There is.
19:15:25 <qubits> Okay i needed that to confirm before i install on my google pixel 4a
19:16:06 <qubits> On wich google pixel is grapheneOs working best
19:16:31 <louipc> pixel 4a is the best choice now
19:16:34 <puriato> Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network. You'll find APN under the advanced options.
19:16:47 <qubits> nice
19:18:14 <qubits> Can i uninstall pre installed apps on GrapheneOS?
19:18:34 <qubits> In case i dont need them
19:18:43 <Golli[m]> There's not many apps there to start with.
19:18:56 <puriato> Blank slate except the essentials.
19:19:04 <qubits> Okay but can i uninstall them
19:19:10 <qubits> What is essential
19:19:34 <emsyna[m]> no
19:21:51 <puriato> Vanadium, Messaging (SMS app), Phone app, Gallery, Files (file explorer), Contacts, Calculator, Clock, Auditor. I think that's all the ones that are permanent.
19:22:14 <puriato> Camera app comes preinstalled but you can remove it.
19:22:36 <puriato> Oh and calendar app is permanent.
19:23:14 <qubits> okay thanks
19:24:05 <puriato> Can anyone help out with why a SIM would work in Lineage/Samsung, but not Graphene/Pixel 3?
19:27:02 <r0tt0r[m]> <puriato "Can anyone help out with why a S"> define not work. phone no/imei shown? apn set correct?
19:27:11 <qubits> purioto wich sim do you use? I cannot help you but i m wondering
19:27:15 <qubits> I hope mine will work

19:41:57 <qubits> I m using macos Big sure 11.0.1 version will that be issue when installing grapheneos
19:42:15 <nscnt> rtevans[m]: You might missed what was written at "Obtaining fastboot". On Debian and Ubuntu it is recommended to use the standalone platform-tools and not the one provided by the distribution.
19:44:19 <nscnt> The platform-tools provided by these are broken and out-of-date. Which is exactly your error message
19:45:19 <r0tt0r[m]> <puriato "r0tt0r The indicator says "No Se"> uh so under about phone the phone no is not recognized?
19:48:07 <rtevans[m]> Ah okay. Well before I did do the curl, echo, and unzip commands and then followed by the export command. All steps were for Linux.
19:50:57 <nscnt> rtevans[m]: What's your output with: fastboot --version
19:51:16 <nscnt> Or have you already figured it out yourself?
19:52:32 <r0tt0r[m]> you might wanna run from platform tools folder: ./fastboot --version
19:53:08 <rtevans[m]> It just says "< waiting for any device >".
19:53:09 <rtevans[m]> I think I'll just try following this video tutorial for the Pixel 3a. Should work the same for the Pixel 4a, right?
19:53:14 <rtevans[m]> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0UFZjuotg&t=354s
19:53:23 <nscnt> rtevans[m]: Don't follow any video
19:53:36 <rtevans[m]> Why?
19:53:52 <nscnt> Outdated and known to cause issues
19:54:59 <rtevans[m]> okay well that sucks. I'll watch it anyway, so maybe I'll get a better understanding.
19:55:07 <nscnt> rtevans[m]: Have you obtained the udev rules?
19:55:17 <rtevans[m]> no
19:56:18 <louipc> if you on linux you may want to flash as root
19:57:05 <Golli[m]> I'm on Manjaro and never had to use root to do anything.
19:57:16 <Golli[m]>  * I'm on Manjaro and never had to use root to do anything except install the needed software.
19:57:50 <rtevans[m]> louipc: Unfortunately, it still gave me the same response.
19:58:13 <Golli[m]> rtevans: Are you using any kind of USB dock?
19:58:47 <rtevans[m]> I'm using an external USB hub, yes. You think that could be the issue? It's USB 3.0.
19:59:01 <Golli[m]> Yes, that's quite likely the issue.
19:59:32 <rtevans[m]> Ah okay. I'll try my laptop then. Thanks.
19:59:56 <Golli[m]> No worries.
20:03:21 <nscnt> rtevans[m]: Might be relevant: https://grapheneos.org/install#troubleshooting
20:03:52 <nscnt> Connection issues are mentioned there
20:05:47 <strcat[m]> joehandcockandjames: Windows 10 has bsdtar as `tar` and bsdtar can extract almost anything
20:06:08 <strcat[m]> joehandcockandjames: it's better than `unzip` which is an abandoned program from 2009 with known vulnerabilities
20:06:38 <strcat[m]> strongly recommend that people follow our official guide
20:06:43 <strcat[m]> exactly as written
20:27:38 <chris42> regarding the prepare vendor: were the previous config files created by some sort of automated script analysing the vendor files or was that just manual labour?
21:03:11 <abumubarak[m]> Does installing GAPPS from Aurora compromise GrapheneOS?
21:08:11 <abumubarak[m]> Let me reword my question. If I install a crypto app from Aurora, does it compromise any privacy issues on GrapheneOS?
21:21:43 <entry1[m]> <abumubarak[m] "Let me reword my question. If I "> Google Play Services compatibility within are not compatible with GrapheneOS, so all apps should have the normal sandboxing with what you give the app permission to access. As long as you trust the app for what you put within it, you shouldn't run into any issues as Aurora just allows you to access apps hosted on Google Play app store.
21:22:41 <abumubarak[m]> Thank you
22:22:08 <abdulocracy> Anyone have experience with building microG-included GrapheneOS builds?
22:23:27 <joehandcockandja> Who's gonna tell him
22:24:33 <Golli[m]> You can have the honour.
22:27:56 <abdulocracy> I know it's not officially supported if that's what you mean
22:29:50 <Dylanger[m]> <abdulocracy "Anyone have experience with buil"> Yep
22:32:29 <Dylanger[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/pull/50
22:32:40 <AndreasSchrgle[m> <abdulocracy "Anyone have experience with buil"> I'm using [robotnix](https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix) to do that, not sure if you'd want to do that, though.
22:32:44 <Dylanger[m]> Pull this, will allow microG to work as a userapp
22:33:29 <abdulocracy> Ah, thanks
22:33:57 <abdulocracy> And as user app do location and push notifications services work?
22:34:13 <strcat[m]> location works fine without microG
22:34:22 <strcat[m]> push notifications implemented by apps themselves work without it too
22:34:58 <abdulocracy> Some of the apps I need don't, so I need the microG implementation to work
22:35:49 <organicpumpkin[m> <louipc "if you on linux you may want to "> Haven't heard that before, why?
22:37:08 <abdulocracy> User doesn't have access to the device
22:37:17 <louipc> organicpumpkin[m: no need to setup permissions for device
22:43:45 <Dylanger[m]> <abdulocracy "And as user app do location and "> With my patch, yes
22:51:53 <abdulocracy> Thanks
