00:00:42 <JTL> The former sounds right
00:02:16 <cn3m[m]> <plain_dust[m] "Hello everyone, am a little curi"> so there are a few technical reasons this is almost impossible
00:03:27 <cn3m[m]> 1. Insider attack resistance they can't update firmware without you PIN this means even Google couldn't try to unlock your phone
00:03:27 <cn3m[m]> 2. Rollback protection means the firmware will only run a newer version
00:03:27 <cn3m[m]> 3. Titan M doesn't have networking and has to pass CTS(open source) as matching the encryption output
00:04:22 <cn3m[m]> Those 3 reasons is why it is essentially impossible for the Titan M to be backdoored. Otherwise it would be noticed in testing. Google won't take a risk. They will pay a million per exploit against it and fix it
00:05:00 <JTL> I wouldn't say "impossible" moreso "much more tricky"
00:05:10 <JTL> But otherwise I agree with that
00:05:47 <cn3m[m]> yeah, if Google was forced to make a backdoor it would only work on currently unlocked phones and Google would kill that backdoored version with the next update
00:06:10 <cn3m[m]> Google would have to be completely taken over and then it would more than likely be caught
00:07:52 <cn3m[m]> The other factor is Qualcomm and Google allow to lock GrapheneOS with your own keys which protects your system even more. That is Canadian
00:08:14 <cn3m[m]> <plain_dust[m] "gov tell tech companies "build x"> you know that Section 215 and the FISA court stuff expired a few months ago right>
00:08:46 <cn3m[m]> Google is now even sharing some NSLs on their transparency site due to improved privacy laws
00:09:30 <cn3m[m]> https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/us-national-security
00:10:21 <cn3m[m]> plain_dust: https://storage.googleapis.com/transparencyreport/legal/NSLs/18-447570/NSL-18-447570-request-redacted.pdf here is one NSL for example
00:10:41 <cn3m[m]> <plain_dust[m] "why isn't the titan chip open so"> I don't know it is something they are planning and they are building an open hardware option too
00:11:06 <cn3m[m]> https://docs.opentitan.org/
00:11:28 <cn3m[m]> Google has traditionally been quite good on open source for example the coreboot usage on Chromebooks
00:13:36 <cn3m[m]> plain_dust: you have to trust the hardware of any system
00:13:58 <cn3m[m]> though we have never seen a real case of a backdoor
00:14:54 <cn3m[m]> Google is very focused on the Enterprise and Education which they have to be privacy sensitive for
00:15:01 <cn3m[m]> they also need good security
00:15:13 <cn3m[m]> most of the Google issues are in consumer software
00:15:28 <cn3m[m]> hardware wise Pixels and iPhones are the only devices confirmed to have WiFi privacy
00:15:58 <cn3m[m]> they are the only devices with insider attack resistance to keep away government pressure
00:16:07 <cn3m[m]> really nothing comes close
00:17:51 <cn3m[m]> you need to trust everyone https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underhanded_C_Contest
00:18:18 <cn3m[m]> it is very easy to hide a backdoor in extremely well audited FOSS code
00:18:19 <aeonsolution[m]> its kind of hard to have honest conversations about security when most avid users are looking for silver bullets
00:18:45 <cn3m[m]> that is a good point whatever you choose there are always limits. Mainly you and root certs
00:18:49 <aeonsolution[m]> there isn't any, you can try your best to educate yourself and look at the compromises and why they are made
00:19:17 <aeonsolution[m]> cn3m: i really appreciate how you you out of your way to help people with their questions

00:41:51 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "hey I know how those laws got im"> could you improve the laws to make killer nanobots legal too?
00:42:49 <nickcalyx[m]> someone would have to sic nanobots on me first, for me to be able to establish legal standing
00:43:10 <nickcalyx[m]> plain_dust: doesn't seem like the end of the world to me
00:48:19 <bonerdose[m]> I feel that Open source software is inherently less secure than proprietary because if anyone can view the source code its much easier to look for vulnerabilities
00:49:03 <bonerdose[m]> But FOSS software is typically more privacy-respecting
00:49:23 <cn3m[m]> <bonerdose[m] "I feel that Open source software"> depends if you have a good internal auditing team closed source is probably better. If the maker doesn't self audit they will probably be better off as open source to lower the barrier to entry
00:50:00 <JTL> I'd argue that to audit software well, you should understand reverse engineering anyway
00:50:34 <bonerdose[m]> Doesn't reverse engineering proprietary software take a very long time to complete
00:50:57 <JTL> It can
00:51:14 <cn3m[m]> it depends yeah
00:51:26 <JTL> But I'm saying irrespective of the software being open or closed source that RE skills are good to have for an audit
01:15:08 <bonerdose[m]> cn3m, Regarding the previous conversation about firewalls, do you think that apps like google camera will leverage the vulnerabilities of the GrapheneOS firewall to access the internet?
01:16:11 <aeonsolution[m]> renlord, madaidan.: are there any resources you can share about kernel security development? i would like to help out in that but don't have any idea where to start
01:17:49 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: https://gist.github.com/madaidan/2031b844d760683af19e85bda184b623
01:19:10 <aeonsolution[m]> oh heck yeah, this is good
01:31:53 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: you know how to find the legacy features right?
01:32:55 <aeonsolution[m]> i do not but you got my attention
01:33:35 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: so there are a lot of features that haven't been brought back(they probably won't be a priority until the Android 11 switch)
01:33:48 <cn3m[m]> I can help point you in the right direction though one sec
01:34:01 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah that would be great
01:34:17 <aeonsolution[m]> after watching this <https://www.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bj1gpz/syzbot_and_the_tale_of_thousand_kernel_bugs/>
01:34:28 <aeonsolution[m]> and reflecting on the patching migration
01:34:48 <aeonsolution[m]> a lot of things clicked and now im super curious
01:35:15 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: here is another interesting writeup a little closer to home
01:35:28 <cn3m[m]> https://ricklarabee.blogspot.com/2018/07/ebpf-and-analysis-of-get-rekt-linux.html
01:36:01 <textmate> ha
01:36:04 <textmate> thats me!
01:36:04 <cn3m[m]> this works on regular and linux-hardened, but it doesn't work on grsecurity if you want a more real world impact
01:36:30 <cn3m[m]> textmate: welcome
01:36:45 <textmate[m]> thanks
01:41:12 <cn3m[m]> aeonsolution: my view on the weakest parts of GrapheneOS right now is definitely the kernel. I think the remote attestation isn't pushed hard enough to make sure a root exploit can't install accessibility services without the user being notified. Accessibility services should have to be approved every boot. Also dynamic native code execution should bring back the toggle and scoped apps would be great. Strengthening those
01:41:13 <cn3m[m]> systems would go a long way
01:42:05 <aeonsolution[m]> ‚úèÔ∏è üóíÔ∏è
01:42:36 <cn3m[m]> And a warning for when you are about to install an app with v1 signing. That could be very helpful
01:46:28 <aeonsolution[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Doesn't reverse engineering prop"> not if they don't obfuscate their code
01:47:09 <aeonsolution[m]> <cn3m[m] "this works on regular and linux-"> oh wow, yeah that is relevant
01:48:01 <aeonsolution[m]> hey, is there a legacy features list?
01:48:27 <cn3m[m]> I am working on that right now. I have to check all the issues and the archive
01:49:02 <aeonsolution[m]> i really dont mind forking the 11 branch i have and dabbling with that, it would be fun to try getting some of that back
01:49:23 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "oh wow, yeah that is relevant"> only thing I have found that really put the kernel through testing. Though some other bugs have been neutralized
01:49:55 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "i really dont mind forking the 1"> of course there are a lot of old features so I will send those your way sorry I didn't remember where they were as much as I thought I did
01:50:14 <aeonsolution[m]> i do remember strcat talking about that
01:50:31 <aeonsolution[m]> but its hard for him to do it all
01:50:46 <aeonsolution[m]> if people saw that video, they would realize how much work that is
01:50:48 <cn3m[m]> the most important feature to me imo is the accessibility approval at boot. Around half the people here do not use remote attestation is the impression I get which means one kernel level exploit and now someone has spyware persistence
01:50:56 <aeonsolution[m]> my mind was blown
01:51:07 <cn3m[m]> since that is one of the most important parts of GrapheneOS the verified boot
01:51:33 <cn3m[m]> if there is a number of people that aren't using remote attestation that could be a bad thing
01:51:41 <cn3m[m]> how to fix that issue is debatable for sure
01:51:54 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "if people saw that video, they w"> yeah I think there are still over 800 unpatched bugs
01:52:31 <cn3m[m]> there are some serious exploit candidates in there I am sure
01:53:39 <aeonsolution[m]> <cn3m[m] "the most important feature to me"> is that a legacy feature, if it is i'd be happy to work on that
01:54:15 <cn3m[m]> https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/labels/past-feature
01:54:28 <cn3m[m]> here is the list of past features
01:54:32 <cn3m[m]> I couldn't find a better list
01:54:46 <cn3m[m]> but if there is any specific code or details you need me to find let me know
01:55:10 <cn3m[m]> I am here to save devs time so whatever you need ^
01:55:23 <aeonsolution[m]> ^^
01:55:47 <aeonsolution[m]> for the level im at, just getting old features restored would be a great start
01:56:18 <aeonsolution[m]> and if it is something of interest for you all and strcat, then thats all the motivation i need
01:56:39 <aeonsolution[m]> developing new features is beyond my skillset at the moment
01:57:06 <cn3m[m]> yeah focus on bring back the old stuff there has been some great old stuff :)
02:07:19 <textmate[m]> Im sorry for probably being the 100th person to ask about this, but do you guys think its a chance that someone will maintain support for Pixel 4a if it comes out tomorrow?
02:07:57 <cn3m[m]> <textmate[m] "Im sorry for probably being the "> pretty solid the 4 laid the groundwork for it and they will more than likely use the same kernel
02:10:58 <aeonsolution[m]> <textmate[m] "Im sorry for probably being the "> getting more people to donate to the project <https://grapheneos.org/donate> and finding people willing to help the devs test out the changes will increase those chances

02:11:59 <textmate[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "getting more people to donate to"> Understandably
04:16:18 <murderous_rabbi4> So I'm looking for secure alternatives to desktop OS. Would Chromium OS be a good choice? Does Chromium OS (as opposed to Chrome OS which only exists for Chromebooks) have support for Android apps? Also, are there any ways one could make Chromium OS privacy friendly too, since I think it still requires you to login to Google?

08:07:23 <cn3m[m]> Every Pixel I have used is pretty bad on it
08:07:28 <cn3m[m]> beside a friend's Pixel 2
08:07:58 <SchismXL[m]> I don't get ghosting, but I get a green hue at the lowest brightness.

09:49:37 <MRK[m]> <cn3m[m] "effectively speaking purism is a"> How?
09:50:35 <cn3m[m]> PureOS doesn't ship microcode leaving devices on it insecure to known attacks
09:50:52 <cn3m[m]> they also oversell their closed hardware and firmware systems as something they are not

09:52:25 <cn3m[m]> <MRK[m] "Do they know this in their own O"> they consider shipping known vulnerabilities a feature

09:57:08 <cn3m[m]> hardware switches aren't that helpful anyway
09:57:33 <cn3m[m]> you record data and upload it when connection is restored
09:58:24 <cn3m[m]> on Android and iOS sensors are restricted but on Linux systems you can even track movement when the killswitches are off and even record 10% of audio
09:59:11 <MRK[m]> It prevents someone from spying on you resistant. That is why phone killswitch is important.
09:59:39 <cn3m[m]> if you have a sensor switch that helps, but at some point hardware switches have limited usefulness considering they assume a fully compromised device and you have to trust the setup of them that they actually work

10:04:34 <cn3m[m]> here is an example of Purism manipulation of data
10:06:45 <cn3m[m]> Google Chromebooks for example use Coreboot, they have an open source kernel, they have a mostly open OS(the debate is on where ChromeOS is bundling closed Applications or if it is a closed OS), they have a freed bootloader, software applications are almost entirely free, repository is debatable, recommending free software again debatable
10:07:19 <cn3m[m]> but Chromebooks are very strong against this chart(if these metrics are all you care about which you shouldn't)
10:10:22 <cn3m[m]> Daniel has gone as far to say Librem is less open than Chromebooks https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20200520#c3925070
10:11:13 <cn3m[m]> that is referring to hardware not the out of the box experience of course

10:21:55 <alzxjm[m]> I dunno. I actually give them more credit than most. I think they have a different definition of "freedom" and they're actually trying in good faith to make products that reflect that kind of freedom.
10:23:14 <alzxjm[m]> They think the user should be able to "control" their firmware, even if it means a kind of hobbled, insecure implementation.
10:23:38 <alzxjm[m]> (we can take this to offtopic, if you want)
10:23:43 <cn3m[m]> Google is more secure and more open on their hardware(and cheaper). Pine64 is more open, more secure(barely), and cheaper(vastly)

11:26:35 <drossbox[m]> Hi all. Dropping in here because the Pixel 4a announcement is imminent, and I'm considering buying one. Given that Graphene already supports the 4, is it likely that an image will be available for the 4a in the near future? If not, what's required to compile it? I'm not a developer but am comfortable in a linux CLI and building things from source, so if it's likely just a question of compiling with a few flags and the
11:26:35 <drossbox[m]> right kernel I'm happy to give it a go.

13:57:55 <johannes[m]2> I tried using https://cgit.typeblog.net/Shelter/about/ to isolate microg and Google Camera. But that app seems to be broken on Graphene.
13:57:55 <johannes[m]2> Any thoughts?

14:37:35 <johannes[m]2> It installs an older version however. But it does not matter because I can update it with the apk i got from an apk mirror site which means the signatues match.

17:12:05 <internetshogun[m> <r357[m] "Is anyone aware if Mint Mobile V"> Has worked flawlessly for me
17:34:18 <bonerdose[m]> What are the downsides of choosing a cheaper MVNO over a major carrier?
17:56:35 <dazinism> bonerdose: guess its an extra party that gets access to your calls, SMS & your cell based network activity
17:57:42 <dazinism> Also think MVNO sims get second class priority compared to sims of the cell network provider
17:58:03 <dazinism> All that isnt based upon any actual research
17:59:01 <bonerdose[m]> Metro is at least owned by T mobile so at least in that case its not really 3rd party

18:20:39 <bonerdose[m]> Isn't aptoide open source?
18:20:54 <textmate[m]> Any updates yet on the Google Pixel 4a?
18:21:00 <lovesausage[m]> Noticed to my suprise that banking app relying on google , that was tricky to get working on MicroG before, worked perfectly on graphene. Have they changed things in their app or do graphene handle request on google somehow? Or is just the pixel thar does the magic?
18:21:29 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <bonerdose[m] "Isn't aptoide open source?"> Maybe, but the app store itself has illegal stuff. Better install F-Droid instead.
18:21:35 <SchismXL[m]> <textmate[m] "Any updates yet on the Google Pi"> Not since the leak this morning.
18:24:11 <BalooRJ> I must be one of the lucky ones for my bank app to not rely on Google Play Services at all
18:26:09 <bonerdose[m]> <BlackWinnerYoshi "Maybe, but the app store itself "> I have f droid I just use aptoide for apps that cost money with no way to purchase unless you have a google account.
18:27:39 <bonerdose[m]> <BalooRJ "I must be one of the lucky ones "> Mine will run without G play services but it crashes when trying to do certain things.  Installing microG services core from f-droid and revoking the network permission fixed the issues, though.
18:28:09 <BalooRJ> I should say according to Aurora my bank's app is not even built with GPS
18:28:11 <BalooRJ> google play services
18:28:20 <bonerdose[m]> Nice
18:28:40 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <BalooRJ "I must be one of the lucky ones "> My bank app is apparently GSF-dependent (source: Aurora Store), but I haven't tested it
18:29:26 <internetshogun[m> I just check my balance via SMS, probably a terrible idea
18:29:31 <bonerdose[m]> When apps don't rely on G play services how do they give you notifications?
18:30:40 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <internetshogun[m "I just check my balance via SMS,"> You should do it via Signal, probably
18:31:13 <internetshogun[m> I do, doesn't really matter since the message being sent is through regular SMS, no?
18:31:17 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <bonerdose[m] "When apps don't rely on G play s"> Signal just asks you to disable battery optimizations to send notifications that way
18:31:37 <SchismXL[m]> <internetshogun[m "I do, doesn't really matter sinc"> Yeah, it doesn't matter. SMS is SMS, regardless of if it is in Signal or not.
18:32:18 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <internetshogun[m "I do, doesn't really matter sinc"> Well, the only thing that happens is that the SMS is stored locally and encrypted, I think
18:34:43 <internetshogun[m> b-but my bank offers the service, so it must be secure!
18:36:07 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <SchismXL[m] "Yeah, it doesn't matter. SMS is "> I think everyone should just stop using SMS and use Signal instead. Maybe someone should create an app called "Force Signal" that blocks SMS and calls, and then sends an SMS saying that one does not use SMS and calls, and instead Signal, and then asks to switch to Signal and also to install "Force Signal"
18:37:02 <BalooRJ> I've never even thought about checking my bank account info with SMS
18:37:08 <BalooRJ> anyone else us privacy.com
18:37:08 <internetshogun[m> <BlackWinnerYoshi "I think everyone should just sto"> Agreed, however the real world does get in the way sometimes unfortunately
18:37:55 <BalooRJ> I like that they're really the only service allowing for single use debit cards so you don't have to go and stick your card numbers in any old website to buy something anymore and fear a hack will leak them
18:39:26 <BlackWinnerYoshi> <internetshogun[m "Agreed, however the real world d"> The "real world" is my "friends", in this case. Imagine having hundrends of friends and then it turns out most of them are fake
18:40:56 <switchdominion[m> I think the problem can be friends who aren't security conscious and having to install another messenger app of which some people already have a few.
18:42:04 <switchdominion[m> SMS, Facebook Messenger, GroupMe, Twitter, Instagram, etc. So many ways of communicating.
18:47:22 <bonerdose[m]> I've tried getting my friends to switch to signal
18:47:46 <bonerdose[m]> They actually did for a bit but they didn't like having to use a different messaging app just for me
18:48:36 <bonerdose[m]> And since I'm obviously not gonna just not stay in contact with 99% of my friends I just use SMS and accept that its part of the deal
18:49:03 <cn3m[m]> I just use iMessage on my iPad with email
18:49:19 <cn3m[m]> SMS sucks less that way and everyone goes for it
18:49:25 <bonerdose[m]> It would be nice to have a I message android app.
18:49:38 <bonerdose[m]> Isn't imessage e2ee
18:49:40 <BalooRJ> I've gotten quite a few friends and family to switch to Signal. Hopefully they don't sell out like Telegram did, and the pin controversy is bad enough
18:49:48 <switchdominion[m> <bonerdose[m] "It would be nice to have a I mes"> I'm pretty sure Google is working on that.
18:49:59 <BalooRJ> I thought Google was pushing for RCS
18:50:12 <BalooRJ> which is still not cross-platform encrypted like iMessage
18:50:22 <cn3m[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Isn't imessage e2ee"> yeah, disable sms fallback though
18:50:23 <BalooRJ> also, did anyone else notice that AOSP now has built in video calling?
18:50:35 <cn3m[m]> RCS is not e2ee sadly the backed odwn
18:50:50 <BalooRJ> I was able receive a video call from someone on a Samsung phone on my GrapheneOS phone
18:51:09 <BalooRJ> which very much surprised me as I thought Google didn't bother to develop that to force everyone onto Duo or whatever stupid messaging app they have out there right now
18:51:13 <internetshogun[m> <BalooRJ "I was able receive a video call "> Natively, huh?
18:51:19 <Joeri[m]> <BalooRJ "I've gotten quite a few friends "> how has telegram sold out?
18:51:29 <Joeri[m]> <BalooRJ "I was able receive a video call "> sure it wasn't through signal?
18:51:43 <bonerdose[m]> Is there any technical limitation for apple to release an imessage app for android?
18:52:07 <BalooRJ> internetshogun: Yep, natively through the calling app
18:52:17 <Joeri[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Is there any technical limitatio"> I don't think so, it just goes against their business model
18:53:03 <hypokeimenon[m]> <bonerdose[m] "It would be nice to have a I mes"> and have the metadata in Google's hands?
18:53:53 <bonerdose[m]> I'm more comfortable with google having metadata than my carrier having everything through sms
18:54:07 <cn3m[m]> Apple supports devices too long to improve iMessage yet. The only reason it is good is since it is apple and everyone uses it
18:54:19 <cn3m[m]> <bonerdose[m] "I'm more comfortable with google"> RCS has no encyrption
18:54:42 <Joeri[m]> <cn3m[m] "Apple supports devices too long "> but it fails at proving its end to end encryption
18:54:46 <Joeri[m]> you can't verify the keys
18:54:53 <Joeri[m]> it's worse than whatsapp's implementation
18:54:55 <BalooRJ> Joeri: Telegram's ban in Russia has now been lifted
18:55:10 <cn3m[m]> WhatsApp is Signal so yea
18:55:50 <BalooRJ> for what it's worth, I'm not an anonymity over all type, I just want data retention
18:56:27 <BalooRJ> the less cloud the better, encryption for security. I think a lot of the movement focuses too much on anons and therefore criminal behavior. Just my 2c
18:59:02 <Joeri[m]> <cn3m[m] "WhatsApp is Signal so yea"> do keep in mind: they say they use the signal protocol, ultimately there's no real way to verify as it's a proprietary app
18:59:09 <bonerdose[m]> Wickr gang rise up
18:59:22 <bonerdose[m]> (Yes I know its proprietary)

19:00:16 <cn3m[m]> Signal built WhatsApp encryption and say it is trustworthy and not backdoored
19:01:00 <Joeri[m]> yeah, I meant more from a theoretical perspective, ultimately there's no way to verify whether any of moxie's code is in the actual whatsapp version shipped. takes off tinfoil hat
19:01:51 <BalooRJ> I know WhatsApp is huge overseas but I don't know anyone who uses it in the US
19:01:54 <bonerdose[m]> <Joeri[m] "yeah, I meant more from a theore"> Generally, if its not a Chinese based app, owned by google or microsoft, and it claims to be E2EE I trust it.
19:02:04 <cn3m[m]> RE it?
19:02:12 <cn3m[m]> any code is open source if you try hard enough
19:02:24 <cn3m[m]> Google uses Signal too
19:02:33 <bonerdose[m]> (((Reverse engineers GTA V)))
19:02:37 <Joeri[m]> <BalooRJ "I know WhatsApp is huge overseas"> it has a lot to do with free sms not being free in most of the rest of the world
19:03:00 <hypokeimenon[m]> <bonerdose[m] "I'm more comfortable with google"> Are you in offtopic?
19:03:04 <BalooRJ> Yeah, I've read that elsewhere as well. Apparently SMS is like 10 cents a message in lots of other places and no one uses it, so they've all been pushed to WhatsApp
19:03:59 <cn3m[m]> Google is far more trustworthy than Facebook. Differential privacy and e2ee is more widespread
19:04:43 <Joeri[m]> <BalooRJ "Yeah, I've read that elsewhere a"> absolutely, I don't think there's necessarily all that much wrong with WhatsApp's encryption, it has more to do with the cloud backup 'solution'. It gives a false sense of security. I'd rather have someone be slightly surprised by an SMS message than give them a false sense of security when I message over WhatsApp
19:05:02 <BalooRJ> Thats why I'm surprised Signal moved to cloud storage as well
19:05:04 <Joeri[m]> Also WhatsApp logs everything you do, metadata is everything
19:05:06 <bonerdose[m]> Do you guys trust Mega for cloud storage?
19:05:10 <BalooRJ> I'd rather just do local backup.
19:05:21 <BalooRJ> bonerdose: Why not just buy a Raspberry Pi device set it up for Nextcloud
19:05:47 <BalooRJ> Mega honestly is just another piracy outlet...considering the owner was criminally charged. But this is probably better for offtopic.
19:06:07 <Kubios[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Do you guys trust Mega for cloud"> just encrypt it beforehand lmao
19:06:10 <Joeri[m]> <Joeri[m] "Also WhatsApp logs everything yo"> moxie even made a subtle jab at whatsapp in the blog post about there being no back door:
19:06:22 <bonerdose[m]> <BalooRJ "bonerdose: Why not just buy a Ra"> Because I don't want local cloud storage
19:07:08 <cn3m[m]> <Joeri[m] "absolutely, I don't think there'"> at least they backup to Google not Facebook
19:09:11 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <cn3m[m] "at least they backup to Google n"> In a relative sense, Google is at least more private and secure than Facebook
19:09:12 <Kubios[m]> true
19:09:12 <cn3m[m]> Google is much more at both

19:09:27 <bonerdose[m]> Google and Facebook collect MASSIVE amounts of data esp. If you use stockOS
19:10:00 <cn3m[m]> Google uses good tech for differential privacy and a reasonable amount of e2ee
19:10:02 <Joeri[m]> "users concerned with the privacy of their message content" I interpreted that as: "we know the metadata isn't protected and are hinting at it here"

19:14:53 <cn3m[m]> https://nitter.net/TinkerSec/status/1289587514240577546#m
19:16:01 <bonerdose[m]> Theoretically, would it be possible for one dude to reverse engineer something as large as GTA V in a month
19:17:36 <cn3m[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Theoretically, would it be possi"> depends on what you mean
19:17:56 <bonerdose[m]> <cn3m[m] "depends on what you mean"> Exposing the entire source code
19:29:33 <internetshogun[m> gotta say I'm pretty surprised by OpenCamera's iq on the 3a
19:35:25 <BalooRJ> speaking of video games
19:35:37 <BalooRJ> will be interesting to see what happens with this gargantuan nintendo leak and all the source code in it
19:35:41 <BalooRJ> that was illegally obtained
19:40:41 <lovesausage[m]> Since i have to use stuff i really dont like , such as whatsapp and other for work. I was hoping for something like lineage privacy spoofing. Say i have to allow position for a bank app. In lineage that wasnt a problem since all info could be faked. Is there something like that for graphene?
19:41:22 <cn3m[m]> <lovesausage[m] "Since i have to use stuff i real"> you mean like XPrivacyLua?
19:45:29 <cn3m[m]> XPrivacyLua runs client side checks to fake location
19:45:35 <cn3m[m]> can be bypassed
19:55:51 <thejoker11[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Do you guys trust Mega for cloud"> If you encrypt your files, it doesn't matter. I'd choose nextcloud with ops one or w√∂lkli as providers
19:56:39 <TheJollyRoger> Cloud service provider comparisons are offtopic here.
19:56:48 <bonerdose[m]> <thejoker11[m] "If you encrypt your files, it do"> Isn't mega e2ee and open source tho?
19:57:38 <Kubios[m]> can you really trust them tho? even if the code is open source that doesn't mean the server is running it
19:58:08 <Kubios[m]> imo just assume everything is bad and encrypt them yourself
19:58:15 <Kubios[m]>  * imo just assume everything is bad then encrypt them yourself
20:01:08 <thejoker11[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Isn't mega e2ee and open source "> It's shady and there are rumors, but I can't say something for sure, especially it's in New Zealand. But if you encrypt your stuff, the provider doesn't matter so much.
20:02:31 <TheJollyRoger> Hey guys. I'd really like to cut down on the amount of privacy veganism here, it's offtopic for this channel.
20:04:04 <TheJollyRoger> This channel's for discussing GrapheneOS development, but what happens between you and your service provider's really outside of our control, and I don't want to see this channel devolve into a game of "more distrusting than thou." That direction breeds toxicity.
20:04:17 <bonerdose[m]> Okay
20:04:22 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks.
20:07:49 <SchismXL[m]> As a side to that, I don't know how long the channel description can be, but if we could put the off topic room link there, it might help, too
20:07:50 <thejoker11[m]> <TheJollyRoger "Hey guys. I'd really like to cut"> Sorry
20:08:35 <TheJollyRoger> SchismXL[m], I've actually begun to wonder about that, to be honest. The thing is, it's kinda more work and mental bandwidth for the team to be herding cats in two channels.
20:09:32 <TheJollyRoger> When we could be spending more time on productive tasks. I know that a certain amount of off-topic ness is meant to build cameraderie and community, but I don't want to see us go the same way as a lot of privacy communities which end up conducting themselves in a nearly cult-like fashion.
20:09:44 <TheJollyRoger> thejoker11[m]: all is well! :)
20:12:17 <TheJollyRoger> Ideally, I'd really like for the community to have the responsibility to moderate itself and not spend its time bikeshedding, especially where speculation is involved, since those topics always go downhill fast.
20:12:33 <SchismXL[m]> Well, if you need help, hit me up. More than happy to herd and/or lighten the load.
20:13:02 <TheJollyRoger> Well, not desperate yet P.-). Let's keep it that way!
20:13:42 <SchismXL[m]> Is that.. Yes, it is an eyepatch smiley face. Brilliant lol
20:13:52 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr!
20:24:45 <bonerdose[m]> Hypothetically, if the NSA is determined to obtain data on my phone, how will GrapheneOS stand up to them if they were to acquire it
20:26:06 <TheJollyRoger> bonerdose[m], hypothetically, they could simply use rubber-hose cryptanalysis to obtain the password from you directly.
20:26:21 <TheJollyRoger> (ie: tie someone to a chair and hit them with a rubber hose until they give away the password)
20:26:31 <TheJollyRoger> Total cost: very little.
20:27:34 <TheJollyRoger> I think fantasizing about worst-case scenarios like "State sponsored adversaries" isn't a great way to spend your time when that's the elephant in the room.
20:28:30 <bonerdose[m]> Yeah that's why I said hypothetically, assuming they comply with laws and the constitution
20:29:30 <bonerdose[m]> From a technical standpoint, would grapheneOS be better than iOS if they obtained my phone
20:29:53 <aeonsolution[m]> https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/bddq5u/os_security_ios_vs_grapheneos_vs_stock_android/
20:30:30 <TheJollyRoger> I really can't answer that about "if they comply with the laws" for you. GrapheneOS will try to protect you against memory corruption/memory handling vulnerabilities and mitigate exploits, and the hardware backed keystore will protect you against password guessing/brute force attacks, but I don't want to speculate on the capabilities of a hypothetical attacker with an unlimited budget.
20:30:58 <aeonsolution[m]> there isn't a one size fits all answer sadly, the project is open source and is trying to make strides to improve security on mobile
20:31:16 <TheJollyRoger> Because in the end, your imagination and hypothesis won't really be establishing a meaningful limit.
20:31:39 <TheJollyRoger> Hey aeonsolution[m], good to see you.
20:31:49 <aeonsolution[m]> likewise friend!!!!
20:32:25 <TheJollyRoger> bonerdose[m]: what aeonsolution[m] said. This topic is really nuanced and really complex. In a large number of ways the devices are very close.
20:32:28 <bonerdose[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "https://old.reddit.com/r/Graphen"> So basically apple is the way to go in terms of security, at least that's what I've gotten from it
20:33:03 <bonerdose[m]> Daniel seems to know a metric f-ton about mobile security
20:33:57 <bonerdose[m]> W A L L  O F  T E X T
20:34:52 <aeonsolution[m]> that's one interpretation, yes
20:35:35 <aeonsolution[m]> it comes down to what you want to make compromises on
20:35:52 <aeonsolution[m]> noone can tell you, this is the defacto way to go because there isn't one
20:36:18 <bonerdose[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "it comes down to what you want t"> Personally, what do you feel more secure with?
20:36:42 <aeonsolution[m]> im a stranger on the internet
20:37:04 <bonerdose[m]> That doesn't mean your opinion is meaningless
20:38:59 <aeonsolution[m]> oh not at all but im biased because i avoid Apple products
20:39:06 <aeonsolution[m]> and not because of security lol
20:39:42 <TheJollyRoger> I will politely recluse myself from topics on whether I would go with an Apple product or GrapheneOS because I have a conflict of interest ;).
20:39:58 <aeonsolution[m]> yeah same
20:40:03 * TheJollyRoger removes his prop eyepatch to wink because you can't wink with an eyepatch on!
20:40:26 <aeonsolution[m]> it doesn't mean i don't think they are good security wise, Daniel breaks that down better than anyone else
20:40:30 <aeonsolution[m]> even Apple
20:41:08 <aeonsolution[m]> but if we were to be strictly talking about the Android ecosystem
20:41:17 <aeonsolution[m]> then yes hands down more secure
20:55:32 <madaidan[m]> <bonerdose[m] "Daniel seems to know a metric f-"> It's part of the job description
21:20:13 <interceptingfist> If anyone wants to buy a great condition pixel 3a with graphene offer $10 less and I'll accept
21:20:13 <interceptingfist> https://www.mercari.com/us/item/m51241284203/?ref=search_results
21:21:59 <interceptingfist> If you want to be 100% anonymous I can accept payment in crypto
21:30:11 <TheJollyRoger> I want to avoid fingerpointing here, and just say that for many of these items, it's been a long time coming and I finally decided to just put it all together. Nobody's being singled out on this.
21:32:48 <TheJollyRoger> Although I've sorta tried to take pride in an honour system, I really think some basic guidelines need to be established to facilitate that.
21:34:28 <internetshogun[m> good ruleset
21:34:33 <TheJollyRoger> Thank'ee.
22:08:31 <aeonsolution[m]> Hi everyone is there anyone in the chat that has a Pixel 3 family (blueline,crosshatch, bonito, or sargo) device that would like to help test the Android 11 kernel+GOS patches on GrapheneOS? This isn't endorsed by the project but it would to help get the migration to Android 11 going.
22:09:08 <TheJollyRoger> I can be up for it shortly.
22:09:17 <aeonsolution[m]> The only requirements are being able to build the development branch <https://grapheneos.org/build#building>
22:09:26 <aeonsolution[m]> Oh heck yeah jolly!
22:10:11 <TheJollyRoger> The computer's in use right now but I can start syncing sources ASAP and getting it underway. Well er... as best I can.
22:10:11 <aeonsolution[m]> it would be great to get more people, the more the merrier
22:10:19 <TheJollyRoger> Yarr. Anyone else?
22:11:47 <aeonsolution[m]> that would be great
22:11:54 <aeonsolution[m]> https://github.com/theaeonsolution/kernel_google_crosshatch/tree/11
22:12:25 <aeonsolution[m]> heres project you need to clone and branch you need to checkout
22:12:46 <TheJollyRoger> Oh boy. Git, git, git, the program that makes me throw a fit, ahaha.
22:13:11 <aeonsolution[m]> lolol
22:13:44 <aeonsolution[m]> no sweat, ill put the commands
22:13:46 <aeonsolution[m]> `git clone https://github.com/theaeonsolution/kernel_google_crosshatch.git`
22:14:04 <aeonsolution[m]> `git checkout 11`
22:14:26 <aeonsolution[m]> then rename the folder from kernel_google_crosshatch to crosshatch
22:14:52 <aeonsolution[m]> https://grapheneos.org/build#kernel
22:15:03 <TheJollyRoger> Once I build the kernel, I need to copy it back into my GrapheneOS source tree, overwrite the kernel there, and then build the GrapheneOS development branch?
22:15:08 <TheJollyRoger> I'm backing up my phone now.
22:15:26 <aeonsolution[m]> when you get to this step, swap out kernel/google/crosshatch with the cloned crosshatch
22:15:43 <aeonsolution[m]> and then follow the steps
22:16:16 <aeonsolution[m]> so i had good 0 issues with the phone i used (pixel 3a) but i dont know if thats the case with the other phones
22:16:28 <TheJollyRoger> Okay! Might take me a bit to get everything prepared and move everything off my phone again.
22:16:36 <TheJollyRoger> Cripes. I should have bought a second blueline. >_<.
22:16:44 <aeonsolution[m]> no rush
22:17:11 <aeonsolution[m]> anything at this point is good, besides hopefully more people will be willing to chip in if they see there
22:17:17 <aeonsolution[m]> is no pressure
22:18:06 <TheJollyRoger> Thanks. I'm trying to prepare what I can now, have to get everything off this phone >_<.
22:18:45 <aeonsolution[m]> lol i just saw we had the same idea in mind about the kernel section
22:18:46 <aeonsolution[m]> eyyy
22:57:32 <iamnotthetoolman> I want to use GrapheneOS but the pixel phones are so damn expensive
22:57:46 <iamnotthetoolman> either the pixel3a is in bad quality or just over the top expensive
22:57:50 <iamnotthetoolman> anyone got a lead on cheapos?
23:08:15 <aeonsolution[m]> the pixel 3a is good and pretty affordable considering the market, when was the last time you checking pricing?
23:09:47 <bonerdose[m]> You ain't gonna find cheaper than Motorola devices before you head into Chinese knockoff territory
23:24:24 <TheJollyRoger> Here's the way I see it: I won't buy any of those other android handsets because they're too expensive. Not expensive to acquire, the issue is the cost of replacing them every year when the vendor abandons them because they didn't negotiate with Qualcomm for more than a year or so.
23:25:16 <TheJollyRoger> "Dust to dust" it just doesn't make sense for me to spend $300 on a phone that's going to be a pop tart in a year.
23:25:28 <ruddo[m]> Yeah.  My Pixel 1 is still working and received updates until last year.  Lasted 3 years.  That's about $300 a year for a decently secure phone.
23:25:38 <ruddo[m]> (XL / 128 G, the most expensive you could buy)
23:26:00 <ruddo[m]> And now that we have the Pixel a phones, it's an even better deal.
23:26:06 <TheJollyRoger> Yeah!
23:39:56 <BalooRJ> I have an OG Pixel that by the time GOS and the exploit to unlock the bootloader rolled around was too far into the cycle, bought the 3a and its been great. Plan on using this phone for a long, long time
23:40:16 <BalooRJ> at least the next two years, have already had it for two. At $400 MSRP that's basically $40 a year
23:40:52 <BalooRJ> and I still have my OG Pixel though I took GrapheneOS off of it after initially flashing it with it due to the fact that support was discontinued though it got quite a few updates
23:43:52 <faxing[m]> How is it $40 a year if you keep it for four years at an msrp of $400?
23:44:01 <faxing[m]> Am I missing something?
23:44:14 <BalooRJ> Sorry, $80
23:44:33 <faxing[m]> O alright
23:44:57 <faxing[m]> All good just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something lol
23:45:06 <BalooRJ> Yeah my math was not good there haha
23:45:25 <BalooRJ> I meant to say that basically I think the phone can last quite a few years, 4-5 years with Google's update timeline
23:45:38 <BalooRJ> and so in the long run like TheJollyRoger was saying the phone won't be expensive
23:46:00 <BalooRJ> I bought my original Pixel in 2017 and it got security updates until last Fall
23:46:20 <BalooRJ> sorry no, 2016 or early 2017
23:46:31 <BalooRJ> basically you can get 4 years out of the Pixel line
23:47:12 <internetshogun[m> I picked up a Pixel 3a that looks brand new for $200 pretty recently. If you aren't looking to spend the $350 for a 4a, just find a used 3a
23:48:09 <TheJollyRoger> Two hundred dollars for a 3a in "like new" condition, that's a good deal, alright!
23:48:27 <mxnorvak[m]> Nice rules, i can't access the links with Riot android app tho, gotta copy and paste the whole topic section
23:49:13 <TheJollyRoger> Hopefully in the future they'll allow hotlinking in topics.
