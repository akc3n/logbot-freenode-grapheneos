00:23:38 <Lckdyspl7[m]> GSM calls are broken on 3aXL unsure if noted  yet on the beta
00:25:22 <aeonsolution[m]> L√¨ck√≠dyspl√Ø7: issues should be reported on https://github.com/GrapheneOS/os_issue_tracker/issues after checking if they have not been submitted yet
00:25:37 <aeonsolution[m]> its hard for the devs that are not always on the channel to keep track
00:26:23 <aeonsolution[m]> providing a logcat of the issue also helps immensely because saying GSM calls are broken is very open ended
00:27:13 <aeonsolution[m]> when in doubt, check out https://grapheneos.org/contact#reporting-issues
00:48:54 <aeonsolution[m]> <nothankyou[m] "And I couldn't apply the patches"> when you go to a new version, you have to make sure you checkout the tag so that you do a clean sync with chromiums source tree before you apply patches. if you do a sync on the same tag you are on, you will mess up your source tree. you will have to nuke you local vanadium folder and start over or if you are resourceful with git, try to fix your tree

02:38:22 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Hmm never mind I had it set to LTE only.. Seems the network switches to 3g to make calls
02:38:35 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Working fine now
03:42:24 <systemctl[m]> What kind of isolation do you get by using a user profile? I've seen it recommended on here for viewing some sites in vanadium.
05:15:37 <juva[m]> Hello, I am exploring the possibility to contribute. Is there FAQ for that? I've checked the one on the webpage and there is nothing about it. Any ideas where to get started?
07:28:09 <traffickpolize[m> <juva[m] "Hello, I am exploring the possib"> Probably check the build guide and run though that. Best way to start likely. Check issues after and do the easiest?
08:54:26 <d122d2d2d2313e> someone knows where the default wallpaper is located?

09:32:06 <dazinism> systemctl: I think using incognito tabs in vanadium gives plenty of isolation for most cases. Think the only time using profiles would help is if the browser was somehow exploited?
09:34:00 <dazinism> I've put a load of info about user and work profiles here
09:34:04 <dazinism> https://hub.libranet.de/wiki/and-priv-sec/wiki/user-profiles
09:35:17 <dazinism> juva: its not been updated in a while, but think most of its probably still relevant.

09:36:25 <dazinism> Think you need to start by getting OS builds to work (on the project website)
09:36:52 <dazinism> Unless you want to help out with apps (probably an easier place to start)
09:39:17 <juva[m]> <dazinism "juva: its not been updated in a "> Thank you, will look into it

10:12:46 <tamqcrg[m]> I have 2 notifications I want to turn off but can't find.
10:12:46 <tamqcrg[m]> The first is the signal "background connection enabled" notice, but seems like I can't?
10:12:46 <tamqcrg[m]> Then also my signal is poor so always lose and gain reception, and every time my phone makes a sound and tells me. Is there a way to turn that off?
10:20:10 <dazinism> tamqcrg You can push  notifications sideways and get to some settings
10:21:36 <dazinism> Not sure about the sound. I don't get that. Is it maybe an app complaining its lost connectivity? Guess you'd see a notification? (Maybe its Signal?)
10:24:08 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Hold on the notification and a setting thing comes up, u can turn off the "connection to server" notification
10:24:59 <Lckdyspl7[m]> Derp daz just answered
10:27:12 <tamqcrg[m]> It seems I can either have all or nothing with signal.
10:27:12 <tamqcrg[m]> For the mobile signal notification I'll try and silence it when I next get it.

10:40:02 <dazinism> tamqcrg: I think you'll get what you are after turning off the 'other' notification channel in Signal
10:45:35 <dazinism> If you push that notification sideways and tap on the cog you see it says other
10:46:45 <dazinism> Then tap on turn off notifications and throw the toggle for 'other'
10:51:12 <LABB[m]> Any info about Android 11 on graphene?
11:15:31 <bbqcore[m]> I was able to change system color accents when the option was briefly abailable in Developer Options
11:15:39 <bbqcore[m]> Will this change hold in Android 11 upgrade?
12:43:57 <helloworld2009[m> Any info about Android 11 on graphene?
12:46:08 <jpds> helloworld2009[m: There's a preview build available
15:38:47 <yoda__1> jpds, " There's a preview build available " Where do we find it ? Is it simple to install it onto my actual GOS, on my Pixel 3a ?
15:40:49 <yoda__1> I am one of those user who hae an issue with a recent update for pixel 3a and can't update for now... SO I have setup my phone to stable (not even sure if it help) but if I checl BETA in the RELEASE CHANNEL, could I have access to the preview build ?
15:41:02 <jpds> yoda__1: Yes
15:41:18 <jpds> It's all on the releases page
15:52:59 <yoda__1> tks jpds  I will look again
15:54:37 <yoda__1> will I have to reinstall " all my softwares " and redo the config ? I am still looking for " Upgrade steps on the release page".
15:56:12 <yoda__1> sargo-ota_update-2020.09.18.13.zip  is the one I need to take ?   (sorry for those noobie questions )
15:58:32 <yoda__1> hello all, I am using version QQ3A.200805.001.2020.09.10.05   And want to try the new preview build.  1) is this the right file ? sargo-ota_update-2020.09.18.13.zip    2) how do I upgrade ? Can't find the info, I know it must be there...
15:58:44 <yoda__1> tks in advance
16:01:53 <jpds> yoda__1: .05 was the cancelled build and unforatunately, you do have to do a full backup and reinstall to go to sargo-ota_update-2020.09.18.13.zip
16:03:38 <yoda__1> :-((  tks jpds  So I supposed it's not " Sideloading " I will use ?  I installed GOS once months ago... Will go reading again on how to do it (will ti be the normal / same method I probably used the 1st (and only) time I did it ?
16:04:10 <jpds> yoda__1: No, sideload won't work, that specific version is broken and needs a full reinstall
16:04:19 <jpds> For that one specifically, otherwise, yes - you would be able to just do a normal update in the updater
16:04:27 <yoda__1> ok tks
16:05:12 <yoda__1> will this preview be " updatable" later ? If not, I will may be wait then
16:05:47 <jpds> Yes, it will
16:06:39 <jpds> But if you're not an experienced user that's willing to handle some breakage/read the release pages for warnings - you shouldn't be on the beta program to begin with
16:11:41 <nothankyou[m]> <jpds "yoda__1: No, sideload won't work"> Cancelled beta to the current beta preview needs no factory reset.
16:12:08 <jpds> nothankyou[m]: I had to factory reset to get it working
16:12:20 <nothankyou[m]> <yoda__1 "hello all, I am using version QQ"> It works, I had tested it like a week ago
16:12:46 <nothankyou[m]> <jpds "Lia: I had to factory reset to g"> From cancelled beta to this beta?
16:13:03 <nothankyou[m]> If you accidentally installed the latest stable, maybe?
16:13:36 <nothankyou[m]> I disabled the updater until the Android 11 GrapheneOS preview was released, and sideloaded it from a computer
16:14:12 <jpds> No, I did not accidentlly install a stable version onto my beta phone
16:15:05 <nothankyou[m]> Not sure what went wrong with yours, but it should not ask for factory reset in sidelaod (from 09.10 to 09.18)
16:15:16 <nothankyou[m]> Tested in two phones
16:16:46 <yoda__1> tks nothankyou[m] !!! so I can try the sidelod ??  even if i have a version " .05  cancelled build"  ?? Just to be sure I get you right
16:17:36 <nothankyou[m]> It was sideloaded as soon as the beta preview got released on beta (on the releases.grapheneos.org link)
16:21:23 <nothankyou[m]> <yoda__1 "tks Lia !!! so I can try the sid"> It should be the case, but not sure whether there was changes on the preview now it is on the new server
16:23:04 <nothankyou[m]> so no guarantees
16:25:03 <nothankyou[m]> But you'd have broken biometrics to deal with
16:35:33 <biotinker> I am interested in trying to build for the pixel 4a.I have very little Android-specific experience, but I do have free time, plenty of non-Android software engineering experience, and a Pixel 4a that I don't mind repeatedly wiping.What exactly would be involved in creating new device support? Is it just a matter of going through the build steps on
16:35:33 <biotinker> the website, https://grapheneos.org/build , and finding ways to resolve errors when they happen? Or would it involve potentially rewriting sections of kernel code from scratch? I don't have an idea of the level of effort required.
16:36:24 <nickcalyx[m]> You can look at the calyxos port for the 4a as a reference
16:37:01 <nickcalyx[m]> Maybe check out the aosp alliance
16:37:03 <biotinker> Where do I find that? I don't see the 4a listed here
16:37:03 <biotinker> https://calyxos.org/get
16:37:42 <biotinker> Is that this?
16:37:43 <biotinker> https://gitlab.com/calyxos/device_google_sunfish
16:37:50 <biotinker> plus the kernel repo
16:38:11 <nickcalyx[m]> https://gitlab.com/AOSPAlliance
16:38:11 <nothankyou[m]> Also: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance/android-prepare-vendor
16:38:12 <biotinker> What's the state of the calyxOS 4a support, will that build/run?
16:38:25 <nickcalyx[m]> Yes
16:38:37 <nothankyou[m]> Already on beta on Calyx?
16:38:45 <nickcalyx[m]> Its in beta yes
16:39:05 <nothankyou[m]> Cool, was faster than sargo getting porter
16:39:13 <nothankyou[m]>  * Cool, was faster than sargo getting ported a year ago
16:40:44 <nickcalyx[m]> It helps to work in a group with aosp alliance! The power of collaboration and solidarity
16:41:43 <nickcalyx[m]> biotinker I bet with some help and advice you could make a graphene port
16:41:45 <biotinker> So looking at the calyxOS sunfish repo, it looks like all the commits are purely configuration changes and some code removal
16:42:01 <biotinker> It doesn't seem like any new logic was needed
16:43:01 <biotinker> That's pretty neat. Makes me think this probably won't be /too/ hard
18:43:49 <yoda__1> nothankyou[m], I finally installing frsh. Am I right saying that if I locked it after previous GOS install, if I unlock it, to install the new version or sidelone, unlocking it, deletes everything ?   (presently installing fresh, but wondering...I'll may be will not lock it after this new install...)
18:48:23 <jpds> yoda__1: If you don't lock it, then you're not enabling any of the verified boot protections
18:50:47 <alzxjm[m]> yoda__1: Unlocking and locking each wipe the device. You don't however need to unlock to update GrapheneOS, if that's what you're asking.
18:52:24 <yoda__1> tks to both, I understand.  Will lockt... Will this Preview version ( Android 11) be updatable to the finale stable version when available ?
18:52:25 <yoda__1> tks
18:55:34 <alzxjm[m]> yoda__1: I believe you can move from Beta to Stable if Stable is on the same version of Android.
19:15:27 <nothankyou[m]> <yoda__1 "Lia, I finally installing frsh. "> Dont unlock
19:15:44 <nothankyou[m]> Oh geez lol
19:15:54 <nothankyou[m]> You were supposed to reboot at recovery
19:16:34 <nothankyou[m]> Then press volume up as you hold power button
19:16:51 <nothankyou[m]> Adb sideload be chosen by navigating through volume button
19:16:56 <nothankyou[m]> Oh well
19:17:36 <nothankyou[m]> <jpds "yoda__1: If you don't lock it, t"> Yeah, I thought it was adb sideload with ota
19:17:43 <nothankyou[m]> Guess maybe not
19:18:09 <nothankyou[m]> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
