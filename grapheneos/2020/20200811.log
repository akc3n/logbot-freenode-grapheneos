00:02:14 <nikitalita[m]> interceptingfist: why would the users of grapheneos, who are generally security and privacy minded, trust some random dude on the internet to install their OS for them? ðŸ¤”
00:02:49 <cn3m[m]> <nikitalita[m] "interceptingfist: why would the "> idk it happens a lot
00:02:50 <nikitalita[m]> grapheneos is pretty simple to install if you follow the instructions. I had zero problems
00:02:53 <cn3m[m]> apparently
00:08:03 <boniek[m]> is there any official stance about how graphene handles qdsp CVEs?
00:14:39 <nikitalita[m]> they didn't release the technical details, so nobody is able to test
00:14:57 <nikitalita[m]> but the most recent OTA update pushed the fixes (I believe? can someone check that?)
00:18:29 <adeus[m]> Whatâ€™s the recommendation how the use Tor Browser on Graphene since the official android version is based on firefox and from what I read it is not recommended install on Graphene
00:19:41 <cn3m[m]> <adeus[m] "Whatâ€™s the recommendation how th"> try another profile, wipe app data after you are done, idk
00:19:44 <cn3m[m]> depends on threat model
00:23:09 <nikitalita[m]> yeah
00:23:34 <nikitalita[m]> user profile, use the tor browser, wipe
00:24:31 <boniek[m]> CVE-2020-11201, CVE-2020-11202, CVE-2020-11206, CVE-2020-11207, CVE-2020-11208 and CVE-2020-11209 are not in latest GrapheneOS update
00:24:34 <nikitalita[m]> tor browser is the only real recommended way to use tor right now; unfortunately firefox has security problems and malicious exit nodes are attacking user right now
00:24:45 <nikitalita[m]> ah, sucks
00:24:51 <boniek[m]> https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-08-01
00:24:57 <nikitalita[m]> are they in the stock android updates?
00:25:08 <ghostcat[m]> I don't get what are the advantage of using a user profile other than hiding the browser itself.
00:25:08 <boniek[m]> they are not in stock
00:25:19 <boniek[m]> I assumed they are not in the Graphene as well
00:25:54 <boniek[m]> nothing specifically mentioned in release notes: https://grapheneos.org/releases#stable-channel
00:26:15 <cn3m[m]> boniek: 1 month embargo
00:26:26 <boniek[m]> strange to release info about bug and no patch
00:26:40 <boniek[m]> oh
00:26:59 <nikitalita[m]> no, wait
00:28:06 <nikitalita[m]> QQ3A.**200805.001**.2020.08.07.01
00:28:06 <nikitalita[m]> this part of the string is the android patch version that this tied to, right?
00:28:32 <boniek[m]> I guess. And? :D
00:29:16 <nikitalita[m]> according to the security bulletin, if you have 200805.001, you have the fixes
00:29:32 * nikitalita[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/BsegSqqIdzZipivNTeWTBVFF >
00:31:19 <boniek[m]> where did you find this information?
00:31:54 <nikitalita[m]> from the bulletin you just posted
00:33:01 <boniek[m]> yeah but there is no info there about these CVEs
00:33:40 <nikitalita[m]> I think he just assumes that people will read the patch notes from google?
00:34:06 <boniek[m]> I did - no info about Qualcomm DSP CVEs there
00:34:32 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, see here: https://grapheneos.org/releases#2020.08.03.22

00:35:25 <nikitalita[m]> so we've had the patches since last week
00:35:44 <nikitalita[m]> before they went out to stock android, apparently, which is cool
00:36:02 <boniek[m]> but how do you know that 2020-08-05 contains fixes for CVE-2020-11201, CVE-2020-11202, CVE-2020-11206, CVE-2020-11207, CVE-2020-11208 and CVE-2020-11209?
00:36:22 <nikitalita[m]> boniek, please read and follow along
00:36:44 <nikitalita[m]> The patch notes for grapheneOS for 2020.08.03.22 say that we have "full 2020-08-05 security patch level"
00:37:28 <nikitalita[m]> The security bulletin says that: "Security patch levels of 2020-08-05 or later address all issues associated with the 2020-08-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels."
00:37:36 <nikitalita[m]> Ergo, we have the fixes
00:38:16 <boniek[m]> either I'm dumb or you didn't explain anything :D
00:38:43 <boniek[m]> how do you know that 2020-08-05 patch level from upstream android contains fixes for CVE-2020-11201, CVE-2020-11202, CVE-2020-11206, CVE-2020-11207, CVE-2020-11208 and CVE-2020-11209?
00:38:52 <nikitalita[m]> dude, read the bulletin that you JUST posted: https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-08-01
00:39:49 <boniek[m]> I did. There is no mention of these CVEs there

00:40:11 <nikitalita[m]> Dude, scroll down, holy shit
00:40:36 <boniek[m]> I did ctrl+f
00:40:38 <boniek[m]> pasted CVE-2020-11201
00:40:40 <boniek[m]> nothing
00:41:04 <boniek[m]> now what
00:41:05 <cn3m[m]> https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-08-01#qualcomm-components
00:41:26 <nikitalita[m]> "CVE-2020-11201" that CVE does not exist
00:41:33 <cn3m[m]> I am not seeing it personally
00:41:37 <nikitalita[m]> you searched for the wrong number
00:41:42 <nikitalita[m]> https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11201
00:42:03 <boniek[m]> https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11201 it says its reserved
00:42:38 <boniek[m]> created on 2020 03
00:42:39 <cn3m[m]> if it was fixed Qualcomm would have said Google pushed it out and probably Samsung
00:43:00 <nikitalita[m]> > CVE-2020-11201, CVE-2020-11202, CVE-2020-11206, CVE-2020-11207, CVE-2020-11208 and CVE-2020-11209 are not in latest GrapheneOS update
00:43:01 <nikitalita[m]> where did you get list from
00:43:31 <cn3m[m]> that is the list of CVEs that are related to this Qualcomm issue
00:43:48 <nikitalita[m]> Presumably, but I'm asking where he got it from
00:44:16 <cn3m[m]> I found the same on a few news sites
00:44:20 <boniek[m]> https://osint.geekcq.com/tag/cve-2020-11209/
00:45:06 <cn3m[m]> here is the blog post(misleading btw) https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/08/06/achilles-small-chip-big-peril/
00:45:16 <boniek[m]> https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/08/06/achilles-small-chip-big-peril/
00:45:21 <boniek[m]> heh yeah
00:45:35 <boniek[m]> thats the source I got it from
00:46:14 <cn3m[m]> It either was embargoed on August 1st to OEMs
00:46:20 <cn3m[m]> or it will be on Sept 1st
00:46:35 <cn3m[m]> so either September or October patch my money is on
00:47:03 <nikitalita[m]> ah hah
00:47:20 <boniek[m]> alright, no fix yet then
00:48:08 <nikitalita[m]> CVE-2020-11201, CVE-2020-11202, CVE-2020-11206, CVE-2020-11207, CVE-2020-11208 and CVE-2020-11209 have not been published yet, patches to stock android have not been pushed yet, I don't know if any of the vendors have released fixes yet
00:58:42 <nikitalita[m]> yeah, I don't see anything in the recent code commits for android that references this
00:59:01 <nikitalita[m]> we're just gonna have to wait
00:59:14 <nikitalita[m]> i saw the talk, they didn't release too many technical details on this
00:59:27 <nikitalita[m]> probably won't be exploited
01:26:33 <nikitalita[m]> interesting

01:48:50 <nikitalita[m]> if somebody were paying close attention to the repo, they would probably be able to figure out what the exploit was and perform it before patches were finally rolled out 5 months later
02:04:06 <strcat[m]> boniek: DSP is not accessible to apps
02:04:27 <strcat[m]> boniek: suggest reading https://twitter.com/DanielMicay/status/1292398497677877249
02:19:14 <nikitalita[m]> strcat: looks like this selinux policy got pushed along with the 08-05-2020 security patch, so we should be fine until the real patches to the affected libraries come out?
02:21:21 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: no
02:21:31 <strcat[m]> it has been like this as long as GrapheneOS existed
02:21:45 <strcat[m]> dunno where you get the idea it appeared with the August security patches
02:24:03 <strcat[m]> @za_vilfp8kn0pcyh-tfcfvapg77a:privacytools.io: if you read what has been written about the Network toggle, you will see that it's explained
02:24:46 <strcat[m]> apps like DownloadManager and various third party apps gate network access based on the INTERNET permission
02:25:45 <strcat[m]> so taking an approach that doesn't work with those checks won't work
02:28:50 <strcat[m]> nikitalita: you're also misunderstanding how security patches and bulletins work
02:29:11 <strcat[m]> it's important that people stop posting their speculation here
02:29:27 <strcat[m]> or if you do then at least clearly mark it as likely misinformation
02:29:40 <strcat[m]> lots of false information being posted here
02:29:47 <strcat[m]> and I'm not going to be around all day to correct it
02:30:55 <aeonsolution[m]> its very time consuming and exhausting to debunk people sharing links they don't fully understand either
02:31:10 <aeonsolution[m]> it's cool to not know
02:32:22 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <cn3m[m] "Just uses stock + restricted USB"> stock has restricted USB?
02:33:26 <aeonsolution[m]> you can change it to just charge, it's in the settings when you plug the device in
02:34:23 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Oh, I thought they had the restricted USB when locked, confused me there for some time
02:35:02 <cn3m[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "stock has restricted USB?"> no CalyxOS adds it
02:35:37 <aeonsolution[m]> oh i misspoke, my bad cn3m
02:35:51 <aeonsolution[m]> didn't know you were referring to CalyxOS
02:36:33 <aeonsolution[m]> i read just use stock + restricted USB
02:37:17 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Same
02:39:01 <cn3m[m]> <aeonsolution[m] "i read just use stock + restrict"> np :)
02:39:29 <cn3m[m]> that is the only hardening patch change they make iirc
02:52:26 <nickcalyx[m]> <cn3m[m] "that is the only hardening patch"> Im open to others
02:53:21 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Not sure if this counts as hardening, but is 64-length password implemented?
02:54:22 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "Im open to others"> I would love to see linux-hardened and hardened_malloc
02:54:23 <cn3m[m]> those are pretty cool
02:54:29 <cn3m[m]> the documentation is excellent as well
03:07:19 <nickcalyx[m]> It's not worth it if it causes crashes and breaks apps
03:07:41 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "It's not worth it if it causes c"> vanadium could be cool to add
03:07:46 <cn3m[m]> that is non destructive
03:08:06 <cn3m[m]> I think linux-hardened is fine too
03:08:19 <cn3m[m]> it is usually hardened_malloc especially on those blobs xD
03:10:53 <nickcalyx[m]> what about all the hardening in android 11
03:11:10 <nickcalyx[m]> https://security.googleblog.com/2020/06/system-hardening-in-android-11.html
03:12:27 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: Android 11 definitely isn't bad, but read the Scudo docs and then the hardened_malloc docs. Even in spite of Scudo not being great it isn't used everyehere
03:22:48 <strcat[m]> nickcalyx: hardened_malloc doesn't break any apps that aren't actively corrupting memory
03:22:57 <strcat[m]> Scudo is nowhere near comparable to what it does
03:24:21 <strcat[m]> there will always be tons of additional hardening work that should be done to improve privacy and security which is the whole point of GrapheneOS
03:27:24 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It would be amazing that one day CalyxOS has GrapheneOS as base but is still usable and compatibility-friendly
03:29:33 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * It would be amazing that one day CalyxOS has GrapheneOS as base but is still just as usable and compatibility-friendly
03:29:52 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: but the app is doing wrong things so it crashes
03:30:02 <cn3m[m]> <za_warudo-vilfp8 "It would be amazing that one day"> I mean CalyxOS originally was built on the project before Coppperhead ruined everything so they rebased on AOSP. iirc
03:30:12 <renlord> realistically, it should be reported to the app developer so they patch it
03:30:27 <renlord> doesnt make must sense for an allocator to bend over backwards to cater to malpractices
03:30:40 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS and CalyxOS both reporting that would carry more weight ^
03:31:14 <nickcalyx[m]> <cn3m[m] "I mean CalyxOS originally was bu"> true
03:31:29 <renlord> all oses should just ship hardened allocator as stock lol so there's more skin in the game
03:31:37 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It's a horrible experience to be forced to use closed source apps in main profile just because it wont open on non-main profile
03:32:12 <nickcalyx[m]> <renlord "realistically, it should be repo"> the app devs won't be too motivated I'd think when you say a non-standard hardened malloc in an obscure android project is exposing memory corruption
03:32:32 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "the app devs won't be too motiva"> well you are finding serious bugs in their program
03:32:57 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: the fact that it is hardened means that it go out of its way to check for misbehaving apps
03:33:05 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <renlord "all oses should just ship harden"> It's about time to raise standards on app development
03:33:11 <renlord> in any case, the code for the app is still wrong
03:33:15 <renlord> and needs to be fixed
03:33:17 <nickcalyx[m]> sure I get that.  I worked with openbsd when they started adding all kinds of malloc stuff like w^x and it exposed memory bugs in programs left and right
03:33:41 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm just talking about how I'd imagine they would prioritize it
03:34:18 <nickcalyx[m]> and how all of a sudden it would be on me to report all these bugs and deal with the app devs, while users wouldn't understand why their angry birds keeps crashing and don't really give a shit
03:34:24 <renlord> i suppose if its a paid service/app, there's more incentive for the developer to uphold their own responsibilities to write correct code
03:34:30 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: hardened_malloc is not that bad at all
03:34:32 <cn3m[m]> not even close
03:35:02 <renlord> but if its free software, the idea there might be that "i'm writing this for free, i'm just gonna ship software that just works and not necessarily correct"
03:35:05 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: I mean Angry Birds is not the NDK
03:35:11 <cn3m[m]> most stuff isn't
03:35:34 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm just making a silly example but you get my point
03:35:46 <cn3m[m]> sorry we are not ganging up on you nick. Do what is best for your community. I love your work
03:35:57 <nickcalyx[m]> I don't feel ganged up on, don't worry :)
03:36:37 <nickcalyx[m]> like I said I'm open to other hardening stuff but that from my POV I have to balance it with UX concerns.
03:36:53 <cn3m[m]> linux-hardened and at least setting up Vanadium would be super transparent afaik
03:36:58 <nickcalyx[m]> the USB locking thing is relatively a no brainer with an obvious upside and little or no downside
03:37:10 <cn3m[m]> if someone who has been involved longer can comment
03:37:11 <analtenderloin[m> How to get hardened_malloc on a tracfone
03:37:26 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m "How to get hardened_malloc on a "> no shitposting please
03:37:50 <renlord> with hardened allocator exposing bugs, its not necessarily obvious how it can be communicated to the user that the app is misbehaving and therefore crash
03:38:03 <renlord> as oppose to them assuming that hardened allocator is out to make life difficult for them
03:38:19 <nickcalyx[m]> I mean, it could trigger some kind of user-facing crash report theoretically with a pop-up
03:38:22 <renlord> maybe streamlining error reporting might help
03:38:27 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: yep
03:39:05 <nickcalyx[m]> ANGRY BIRDS MEMORY FAIL   please email this bug report to securityâŠ™ac
03:39:05 <cn3m[m]> can't hardened malloc be implemented only for the stock system and not the third party apps pretty easily?
03:39:13 <renlord> i think with that kinda approach, users can then take action and escalate with the app vendor instead of complaining to the OS about random apps crashing
03:39:38 <renlord> cn3m[m]: you can, but what is the point then?
03:39:48 <nickcalyx[m]> but if I am going for a more mainstream audience they won't want to escalate with the app vendor
03:39:48 <renlord> the OS is meant to be a security hardened ecosystem
03:39:56 <cn3m[m]> true
03:40:19 <nickcalyx[m]> most people don't have the knowledge to make a useful bug report
03:40:24 <nickcalyx[m]> if you didn't notice ;)
03:40:39 <renlord> some apps have very nice bug reporting capabilities
03:40:49 <renlord> when they crash, they have a nice template so its easy to report issues
03:41:16 <renlord> most of the time, people dont know what information to gather and what to write when they report issues
03:41:32 <renlord> if they knew, they probably would report
03:41:47 <nickcalyx[m]> look let's say hardened malloc gets into lineageOS.. just for the sake of argument.   they claim to have 1.7 million phones.   I still don't think the app devs would put that very high on their priority list
03:42:11 <nickcalyx[m]> because app devs are just trying to get the most money they can and get that next round of funding
03:42:24 <analtenderloin[m> <nickcalyx[m] "look let's say hardened malloc g"> I won't consider it until they support verified boot
03:42:29 <cn3m[m]> technically it is a security issue not just a bug
03:42:39 <nickcalyx[m]> that kind of funding driven development cycle doesn't lend itself to trying to get everything to be 'correct'
03:42:48 <cn3m[m]> *not all the time
03:43:01 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah but if it doesn't affect people on stock android then they may not give a shit
03:43:03 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: i suppose it depends how metrics are measured
03:43:12 <nickcalyx[m]> if it doesn't affect them today I mean
03:43:15 <renlord> typically, you reach a goal when something is implemented *correctly*
03:43:26 <renlord> not some half-assed working prototype
03:43:39 <nickcalyx[m]> or maybe they would care and it would be on their to-do list but just not very high up on it
03:45:13 <nickcalyx[m]> that's my fear.. that if I put this in calyxOS I would be both taking on a huge workload onto myself, therefore widening the scope of my task by a huge amount AND at the same time pissing off users and ensuring I can't reach the level of adoption I'd want to
03:45:45 <nickcalyx[m]> it would be one thing if the whole ecosystem was open source and I could just send patches
03:45:54 <nickcalyx[m]> but even that is a gargantuan task
03:46:13 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: any idea when calyx 4g network is expanding?
03:46:19 <renlord> or beyond the USA
03:47:09 <nickcalyx[m]> I'm curious to see what android 11 is like
03:47:18 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: maybe you can ease your users into it
03:47:22 <renlord> by having a toggle of sorts
03:47:24 <cn3m[m]> Android 11 is an improvement
03:47:42 <renlord> security hardened mode vs. normal mode or something
03:47:57 <renlord> and hopefully via education, more people switch on the toggle
03:48:57 <nickcalyx[m]> yeah I discussed having a toggle with Chirayu but he didn't think it would work or be practical.. I said why not have some selector like grub where you can choose different kernels
03:49:38 <renlord> what were the key painpoints?
03:50:01 <nickcalyx[m]> let me ask a question.. so hardened malloc sometimes exposes memory bugs in apps... so roughly how many closed source app makers have you guys gotten to fix their bugs by showing them that it's crashing on graphene
03:51:30 <cn3m[m]> the only 3rd party app(not blobs) I can remember was Unity
03:51:44 <cn3m[m]> I don't remember what happened with that
03:51:53 <cn3m[m]> I sent anu a logcat
03:52:18 <nickcalyx[m]> how many other apps do you know if that crash
03:52:27 <renlord> its good to have all of these logged in the issue tracker so other people learn how they are resolved also
03:52:46 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: it is extremely rare that is all I know
03:52:52 <cn3m[m]> for 3rd party apps
03:52:54 <renlord> as oppose to needing to repeat troubleshooting/fixing to interested parties
03:53:05 <nickcalyx[m]> its a long time ago but I remember the camera app used to crash on copperhead
03:53:10 <cn3m[m]> 2 apps broke lately, but that was SELinux rules
03:53:19 <cn3m[m]> <nickcalyx[m] "its a long time ago but I rememb"> that was also an issue on the Pixel 3 lately
03:53:26 <renlord> nickcalyx[m]: camera is still an ongoing issue.
03:53:40 <renlord> dont think we have reported it upstream
03:53:51 <nickcalyx[m]> why not?
03:54:51 <renlord> for me personally when i tried to look into it, the trace is incomplete since it just stops at the HAL layer. With an incomplete trace, I'm not confident in writing a detailed/comprehensive enough bug report to highlight what exactly the issue is
03:55:24 <renlord> aimagereader was an issue also
03:55:33 <renlord> and daniel had to implement a workaround
03:55:40 <renlord> i think that was reported upstream
03:57:14 <cn3m[m]> nickcalyx: yeah it is when switching views iirc
03:59:59 <cn3m[m]> it seems to mostly be those blob issues and due to the projects similar device support shouldn't be a problem since GrapheneOS fixes the issues
04:01:34 <cn3m[m]> and the other changes really shouldn't cause issues
06:33:41 <larncat[m]> Pixel 3 here. Camera crashes on approx 1 in 10 launches.  Usually restarting the camera app fixes. Every few failed launches I'll get a 'serious camera error'.
07:03:01 <Vicarious[m]> Standard camera?
07:06:44 <renlord> larncat[m]: it is a known issue
07:07:39 <larncat[m]> renlord: roger
07:10:10 <larncat[m]> Vicarious: yes
07:11:50 <cdesai> Personally that was one of the biggest pain point
07:12:13 <cdesai> I remember looking into this way back (if its the same crash) but getting nowhere
07:13:35 <cdesai> How do you even add a toggle for something like this anyway renlord
07:14:31 <renlord> cdesai: what is 'that' and 'this'/
07:14:58 <cdesai> 1) camera crashing
07:15:11 <cdesai> 2) the toggle discussion for hardening
07:15:19 <cdesai> This is where matrix shines, replies.
07:20:24 <cdesai> Verified boot would get in the way for a kernel option, and then how do you switch malloc at runtime without issues.
08:09:56 <hitchhooker[m]> > let me ask a question.. so hardened malloc sometimes exposes memory bugs in apps... so roughly how many closed source app makers have you guys gotten to fix their bugs by showing them that it's crashing on graphene
08:09:56 <hitchhooker[m]> my bank seem to fix their 2FA codeapp
08:57:04 <kan12> I'm looking to help out with some of the tasks for vanadium, i've synced and tried building the source code but i'm not too sure what would be a good setup for actually developing patches for it
08:57:27 <analtenderloin[m> y
08:58:28 <za_warudo-vilfp8> <kan12 "I'm looking to help out with som"> Try using a reference? Just a suggestion, not to be taken 100% seriously since I'm no developer, but that's what would I do.
08:58:37 <ham5urg> I'm a noob but thinking about to buy a PixelPhone to install grapheneOS. I have some questions or maybe only one. Why is microg (lineageOS) not a needed thing or why is it bad?
08:58:43 <za_warudo-vilfp8> example, try using references from Bromite, like always incognito mode
08:59:17 <cn3m[m]> <ham5urg "I'm a noob but thinking about to"> microG is not related directly to Lineage they are separate projects first
08:59:26 <cn3m[m]> but Lineage breaks the security model of stock Android badly
08:59:36 <cn3m[m]> the goal of GrapheneOS is to strengthen stock Android
09:00:07 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Or maybe toggling some flags on by default like reduced-referrer-granularity
09:00:19 <ham5urg> cn3m[m], did not know that.
09:00:25 <cn3m[m]> for example Lineage breaks verified boot, remote attestation, rollback protection, it weakens security on he sandbox, and misreports patch level
09:00:35 <za_warudo-vilfp8> #prefetch-privacy-changes
09:00:43 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS goes the opposite direction and adds security
09:00:48 <kan12> that sounds like a good idea
09:00:58 <cn3m[m]> and privacy of course, but the two are interconnected
09:01:08 <ham5urg> So lineageOS is for the trashcan.
09:01:26 <cn3m[m]> that is why Pixels are the only currently supported device as they are truly the only devices that offer full control over the system
09:01:37 <cn3m[m]> while giving on time updates and such
09:01:54 <ham5urg> And if so, why did they invented microg. To fix a bad system?
09:01:56 <cn3m[m]> <ham5urg "So lineageOS is for the trashcan"> I mean if security and privacy are a goal yes it is far from ideal
09:02:09 <cn3m[m]> <ham5urg "And if so, why did they invented"> microG is a seperate project
09:02:11 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * .
09:02:19 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Or maybe toggling some flags on by default like
09:02:19 <za_warudo-vilfp8> $reduced-referrer-granularity
09:02:19 <za_warudo-vilfp8> #prefetch-privacy-changes
09:02:24 <cn3m[m]> the goal is to reimplement Google services but less bad
09:02:27 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Or maybe toggling some flags on by default like
09:02:27 <za_warudo-vilfp8> #reduced-referrer-granularity
09:02:27 <za_warudo-vilfp8> #prefetch-privacy-changes
09:02:37 <ham5urg> Yes, but why put effort into it if lineageOS is not secureable?
09:02:37 <cn3m[m]> microG has some privacy concerns and security concerns
09:02:41 <cn3m[m]> I know for example
09:02:42 <ham5urg> I see, less bad.
09:02:50 <cn3m[m]> it supports Google cloud messaging
09:03:02 <mokulus> fellas why even have a phone if you are privacy oriented?
09:03:02 <cn3m[m]> so it is still using unencrypted notifications
09:03:13 <cn3m[m]> through Google's servers
09:03:27 <cn3m[m]> <mokulus "fellas why even have a phone if "> since they have much better privacy and security
09:03:58 <ham5urg> cn3m[m], microg uses google servers??
09:04:08 <cn3m[m]> WiFi Privacy, encryption, and app sandboxing are orders of magnitude better on a modern mobile OS
09:04:12 <cn3m[m]> say GrapheneOS and iOS
09:04:26 <cn3m[m]> if you have concerns with cell triangulation well that is an optional feature to use cellular
09:04:35 <cn3m[m]> so you can use Airplane mode if you like
09:04:42 <cn3m[m]> <ham5urg "cn3m, microg uses google servers"> correct for messaging and accounts

09:04:57 <cn3m[m]> microG is not a fully degoogled experience for sure
09:05:19 <cn3m[m]> ham5urg: it also requires the apps to be able to bypass Android's cryptographic app guarantees
09:05:21 <cn3m[m]> which is usually a security risk
09:05:56 <ham5urg> what a mad world...
09:06:11 <cn3m[m]> GrapheneOS has a sort of sister project(that is less extreme) that nails down the microG implementation pretty well security wise
09:06:15 <cn3m[m]> CalyxOS is very cool
09:06:24 <cn3m[m]> though microG is just weird
09:06:27 <frenchieisverige> <mokulus "fellas why even have a phone if "> Because we are living in the 21 century
09:06:29 <ham5urg> So, ok, I wil look for a pixel phone.

09:07:01 <cn3m[m]> <analtenderloin[m "what changes to microG do they m"> they have signature spoofing specifically for those packages only and only for CalyxOS signatures

09:09:32 <cn3m[m]> you can use it with capillary

09:09:42 <cn3m[m]> and you COULD always do it before even
09:09:49 <xohoh[m]> protonmail use it as well, but apps can also use their own implementation
09:11:23 <cn3m[m]> ham5urg: so basically GrapheneOS is fully degoogled(beside some empty connections to blend in on the network covered in the FAQ). It adds a lot of hardening from the Vanadium web browser to the hardened memory allocator, to the hardened linux kernel
09:11:46 <cn3m[m]> it also adds a firewall that isn't a total joke like the other ones on Android
09:11:56 <cn3m[m]> you also have access to the sensors permission
09:20:15 <cn3m[m]> pixulus: right, but it is really rare in the real world
09:23:17 <ham5urg> cn3m[m], thanks for pointing out to the FAQ, that is a transparent overview: https://grapheneos.org/faq#default-connections
09:23:44 <cn3m[m]> yes I have confirmed that is what it is actually doing btw
09:24:23 <cn3m[m]> the FAQ and Usage guides are great
09:26:28 <ham5urg> Just one more question about the device-list, is there any other device which is able to run grapheneOS? I took a look at https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/xz2c which I would like to buy as it is a little bit smaller.
09:27:01 <ham5urg> I guess it won't work, but who knows.
09:29:39 <ham5urg> Maybe the PinePhone / AllWinner-CPUs will get an ANdroid implementation in the future.

13:23:57 <ham5urg> Is there a list of these devices: "Many other devices are supported by GrapheneOS at a source level, and it can be built for them without modifications to the existing GrapheneOS source tree."?
13:25:20 <renlord> cdesai: any ideas what aosp component should i be filing under for the hwbinder issue with the camera provider?
13:25:39 <renlord> the fault is within in the vendor blob (sigh)
13:26:19 <cdesai> renlord: I think you might just have to go for a generic component and then hopefully somebody internally sees and assigns correctly

14:56:28 <robocat[m]> Should i ditch my lineageOS phone for a graphene one, i heard its better
14:56:38 <robocat[m]> What are the reasons
14:57:20 <erhcetua[m]> if you have money for it / more secure, as close as AOSP as possible with hardening
14:57:43 <erhcetua[m]> no google as well
15:04:26 <robocat[m]> What makes graphene harder then lineage though
15:05:01 <Jertzukka> Lineage requires you to unlock your bootloader which is less secure AFAIK

15:08:46 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Of course, you can install it for free too
15:09:41 <za_warudo-vilfp8> furthermore, the connection made by GrapheneOS is also documented on the same site there
15:09:41 <za_warudo-vilfp8> It's a good starting point
15:10:33 <za_warudo-vilfp8> Also, unlike LineageOS, GrapheneOS doesn't mislead on security patches and gives it out fully, along with using user compared to userdebug builds and also locked bootloader to check OS integrity through verified boot
15:10:39 <sukiyakiwestern> IMO with the android vulnerabilities showing up lately, graphene on a pixel is a safer bet for consistent security updates
15:10:54 <sukiyakiwestern> Lineage even when official is inconsistent
15:10:57 <za_warudo-vilfp8> * Also, unlike LineageOS, GrapheneOS doesn't mislead on security patches and gives it out fully, along with having user builds compared to (LOS) userdebug builds and also locked bootloader to check OS integrity through verified boot

15:24:11 <robocat[m]> I have the money and my current phone is old af
15:35:49 <xnat834[m]> Is it possible to install different versions of apps on different users?
15:36:03 <theultron[m]> <xnat834[m] "Is it possible to install differ"> No.
15:36:09 <xnat834[m]> Aww
15:38:14 <strcat[m]> xnat834: if the apps have the same id + signature, they're treated as the same app installation
15:38:31 <strcat[m]> I'm unsure if it uses only id or the combination of app id + signature for that
15:38:48 <strcat[m]> if it uses only app id then it will just give an error if you try to install one with the same id but different signature
15:39:24 <strcat[m]> I expect it's just app id
15:41:05 <strcat[m]> ham5urg: every Android device is required to support AOSP system images and the vast majority would need very few changes to use a GrapheneOS system image - but it's not really GrapheneOS without it providing the rest of the device support code too
15:41:17 <xnat834[m]> Thanks!
15:41:39 <strcat[m]> ham5urg: it's easy to reuse AOSP support for any device where AOSP device support code is available though
15:42:24 <strcat[m]> mostly need to make some minor tweaks to the device-specific SELinux policy and a few variables, along with porting over the kernel hardening from AOSP and GrapheneOS
15:43:09 <strcat[m]> it'd work without porting over the userspace/kernel hardening though
15:43:14 <ham5urg> strcat[m] I have Samsung T813 tablet which is supported by LOS but as you showed to me, there is no possibility for me to use LOS. So I was digging a bit to install a AOSP build environment.
16:48:56 <anupritaisno1[m]> @freenode_ham5urg:matrix.org: glassrom if you can't
16:49:08 <anupritaisno1[m]> Just remember
16:49:40 <anupritaisno1[m]> These days I keep staging changes on glassrom before strcat either accepts/rejects them on grapheneos
16:49:46 <anupritaisno1[m]> Some things may be broken
17:23:01 <faxing[m]> Does GlassROM have anything that Graphene or Calyx doesn't? I hear you talk about it a lot but I'm unsure of it's overall purpose or advantage...
17:23:35 <strcat[m]> it's a port of many of the GrapheneOS changes onto a LineageOS base instead of AOSP
17:23:54 <faxing[m]> Oh
17:23:56 <strcat[m]> so it has issues that GrapheneOS does not
17:24:03 <strcat[m]> but it can take advantage of the broader hardware support
17:24:06 <faxing[m]> That seems strange?
17:24:12 <faxing[m]> Then why would you use it?
17:24:28 <faxing[m]> Other than hardware support
17:24:33 <strcat[m]> although AOSP can support all the same hardware, it just takes more work, and it'd be missing more hardware-specific features
17:24:44 <strcat[m]> you wouldn't use it on a device that GrapheneOS supports
17:25:31 <strcat[m]> if cleaner / standalone AOSP support was developed for those devices then anupritaisno1 could probably maintain that instead
17:25:37 <strcat[m]> but it's non-trivial
17:25:39 <faxing[m]> Oh okay, so its literally just Graphene with less privacy and security hardening, more bugs and issues, but on a wider range of devices?
17:26:01 <faxing[m]> * Oh okay, so its essentially just Graphene with less privacy and security hardening, more bugs and issues, but on a wider range of devices?
17:36:17 <strcat[m]> a different range of devices
17:36:45 <strcat[m]> faxing: I would not say it's "essentially just GrapheneOS"
17:37:19 <strcat[m]> and I think it does have most of our changes applied but that's on top of the LineageOS changes
17:42:22 <null[m]> what does grapheneOS have over LineageOS?

19:05:28 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i hate this bad "need internet connection" for "enable oem unlock", say saved my location based on wlan connections
19:06:20 <faxing[m]> Yeah
19:06:33 <faxing[m]> Not sure why that's a requirement
19:06:52 <faxing[m]> Just glad I have Graphene now, though.

19:10:46 <erhcetua[m]> you do have some feedback about flashing system and stuff but nothing special
19:11:26 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> all problems are documented
19:11:58 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> eazy
19:13:45 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> no feedback in the installer is frustrating, the phone is only in fastboot mode with device state unlocked
19:13:50 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> and nothing happens
19:23:12 <nickcalyx[m]> the installer, you mean the flashall script ?
19:23:34 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> yes
19:23:51 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> over 10 minutes no feedback
19:24:28 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> nice
19:24:35 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> need reconnect the cable
19:24:47 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> now it's running
19:24:51 <norbert[19> t32tt23tt32tt23t: remove the cable, start flash-all.sh, connect the cable, that worked for me
19:25:02 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> Finished. Total time: 0.103s
19:25:27 <norbert[19> Maybe a bug in fastboot...
19:29:03 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i locked the bootloader directly after this
19:29:21 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> now it boots default google android =/ and all again
19:30:09 <Vicarious[m]> "t32tt23tt32tt23t" (https://matrix.to/#/@t32tt23tt32tt23t:matrix.org) have you tried another USB cable?
19:30:16 <Vicarious[m]> Or another port?
19:30:43 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> my only charging usbc port with original cable
19:31:00 <Vicarious[m]> If it is flashing default Google, you're doing something wrong.
19:31:46 <Vicarious[m]> OG cable can be hit or miss.
19:32:06 <Vicarious[m]> Try a USB 2.0 port
19:32:32 <Vicarious[m]> Or a USB C to A

19:35:38 <erhcetua[m]> you can always check your device is detected with "fastboot devices"
19:36:10 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> there is a connection, thats not the problem
19:39:42 <Vicarious[m]> Using the latest platform-tools, too?
19:40:43 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> arch has not the latest
19:40:48 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> ?
19:41:38 <nickcalyx[m]> No
19:42:12 <nickcalyx[m]> Need to follow the graphene install instructions
19:43:53 <Vicarious[m]> Lol

19:44:38 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> fastboot: error: requirements not met!
19:45:01 <Vicarious[m]> What's your fastboot version?
19:45:14 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> fastboot --version
19:45:14 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> fastboot version 30.0.0-2
19:45:55 <Vicarious[m]> Follow the guide
19:46:10 <Vicarious[m]> Don't use Arch's fastboot
19:46:22 <Vicarious[m]> https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools download it from here
19:46:45 <Vicarious[m]> Then do
19:46:48 <Vicarious[m]> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
19:47:00 <Vicarious[m]> And don't close terminal after you've done that.
19:47:29 <Vicarious[m]> If you downloaded platform tools to Downloads...
19:47:29 <Vicarious[m]> cd ~/Downloads
19:47:29 <Vicarious[m]> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
19:47:38 <Vicarious[m]> * If you downloaded platform tools to Downloads...
19:47:38 <Vicarious[m]> cd ~/Downloads then
19:47:38 <Vicarious[m]> export PATH="$PWD/platform-tools:$PATH"
19:48:11 <Vicarious[m]> then export* formatting is wank on the app.
19:48:28 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> here in the docs is 30.0.3; https://grapheneos.org/install#standalone-platform-tools
19:48:42 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i try 30.0.4
19:54:27 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> fastboot --version
19:54:27 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> fastboot version 30.0.4-6686687

19:55:27 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> same
20:01:20 <erhcetua[m]> update to original rom first
20:01:26 <erhcetua[m]> then try again
20:01:43 <erhcetua[m]> also as arch has update often, you can use their fastboot
20:02:06 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> yes
20:02:28 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i executed every line in flash-all.sh by hand
20:02:40 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i musst reconnect usb between some steps
20:03:07 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> now it works =) <3 and i have graphene on second phone
20:03:48 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> it's not good style with flash-all.sh without feedback
20:04:46 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i saw a graphene bootloader for a short time, but then it is gone

20:21:40 <Vicarious[m]> The USB cable is having trouble.
20:22:16 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> yes maybe, the slot or driver
20:22:37 <Vicarious[m]> C to A, plus USB 2.0 slot (okay, will take longer) seems to work nicely
20:24:06 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> there is no original C to A cable or adapter, and much cable doesn't work
20:24:42 <Vicarious[m]> As long as you've installed the android rules or using root (not recommended, but works for me every time), drivers shouldn't be an issue
20:25:04 <Vicarious[m]> <t32tt23tt32tt23t "there is no original C to A cabl"> eBay, Amazon, a friend lol
20:25:33 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i have some usb-c to usb-a cable, but only orignial work for me
20:25:51 <Vicarious[m]> Some cables are better than others tbh
20:25:53 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> i don't use root, right
20:26:14 <Vicarious[m]> Nah, I don't recommend using it
20:26:14 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> only for fastboot
20:26:29 <t32tt23tt32tt23t>  * only for fastboot (lock/unlock
20:26:36 <t32tt23tt32tt23t>  * only for fastboot (lock/unlock)
20:27:15 <t32tt23tt32tt23t> okay, everything fine it works
20:27:29 <Vicarious[m]> If you have android rules, you shouldn't need to?
20:27:30 <Vicarious[m]> Can't remember off the top of my head tbh
20:27:30 <Vicarious[m]> Muy bien

23:10:58 <refragable[m]> Yes, uninstall adb too if you installed it with `apt-get`
